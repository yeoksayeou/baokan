<h3>崑山徐公橋之耕牛比賽會</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>徐公橋屬崑山縣境距嘉定之安亭可三里許當江浙交閧時徐公橋適臨戰區之要衝幸有前江蘇省議會議員蔡璜君奮不顧身於砲火瀰漫之頃聯絡地方壯丁組織保衛團徐公橋未化爲灰燼者蔡君之功也戰事告終上海中華職業指導所乃託蔡君於其地劃爲新村經營五六載村内設施己燦然可觀日前由新村主管辦事處舉行耕牛比賽大會用記其事以實本談</p>
<p>新村組織悉依中華職業敎育指導所擘劃而定者有新村學校一所學童可三百名建設方面有公共演講廳有養鷄塲養蜂塲等娛樂方面有音樂社話劇社此次耕牛比賽大會以全村三百餘户各出牛一頭魚貫游行新村一周并指定村外隙地一隅爲數百頭耕牛駐足之所舉凡男歸老幼草不空户來觀由新村辦事處預聘評判員十人以分别牛之優劣比賽宗旨不切重牛之身材質地而評判牛之肥碩清潔蓋質地身材在富裕者可以代價購得專事肥碩清潔則顯然係於平素飼養也評判結果第一名特奬打稻機一架其次者亦均有鼓勵最次者且奬鋤頭一柄會事告終莫不喜形於色携牛以歸也</p>
<p>復聞職業敎育社所以設新村於徐公橋者以蔡君熱心公益付託有人而該地村民胥各具初步之自治智識新村禁烟禁賭爲嚴定之信條無人敢犯若鷄塲之鷄爲購自外來之蛋鷄塒特殊清潔而農事用器亦采選最新式機件五榖種子由各省徵集而來云</p>
<h3>燦燦羣星</h3>
<p>— 淡烟</p>
<p>兩閱月前滑稽大王卓别林氏之「城巿之光」片方開映於美國各地其盛况乃空前至售座破未有之紀錄然此片僅配音樂未有對白際此有聲片流行之際而卓别靈竟獨具隻眼力挽狂瀾以得偉大之成功誠難能可貴者矣於此可知表演之藝術實爲影片成功之原素有聲片固爲電影事業之進步而無聲片之地位固依然未嘗低落一切影片受人歡迎與否胥視其表演之藝術何如耳</p>
<p>論表演在西方女星中我愛曼蘭璧克馥之天眞琵琶但妮兒之活潑克蘭拉鮑之熱烈梨琳甘煦之悲哀葛麗泰嘉寳之嫻靜珍　蓋諾之自然南珊卡珞之温馨麥克唐納之富麗…無論其或老或衰或方入勝境然銀幕之上固長留不可磨滅之勝跡爲一般影迷所醉心</p>
<p>若在我國則海上一隅星光燦然而人材輩出亦多異材如胡蝶之温淑夏佩珍之矯健宣景琳之嫵媚固己有目共賞然尙有一星雖盛名己傳而過去諸片似猶未盡其能者則爲英俊爽利之梁賽珍是梁女士能歌舞尤嫻武術昔在華劇公司主演多片而未得志今爲一材衆多之明星公司搜羅以去主演「三箭之愛」片及其成功乃令我人括目相看足使梁女士一躍而躋於國内第一流明星之列矣</p>
<p>蓋表演之藝術重自然而不能造作重流利而不能澀滯重細膩而不能不顧小節重親切而不能拘於一隅證諸西方各大明星其能集衆長而博觀衆之讚美者良非倖致然出於意料之外者則梁賽珍女士之「三箭之愛」片竟兼有自然流利細膩親切之四長其突異之進步必能爲國産電影界添一優越人材滋可喜也</p>
<p>際兹有聲片流行之際。我人苟欲一換口味而一覩「三箭之愛」者以覺有意外之剌激奮興蓋片中表演之藝術旣臻絶頂而劇情之曲折背景之雄奇尤一破過去平淡簡陋之弊也</p>

<h3>北行散紀</h3>
<p>— 安平</p>
<p>十一　北平</p>
<p>這次我在北平約摸逗留了二十天但對於所謂眞眞的北國的生活我仍然是隔膜的因爲刮風不大出房對於北地的自然風趣和都會生活都未能充分去體會不消說我得承認這是最大的遺憾要呌我具體地寫一些北平的印象眞寫不出我片地談一些吧</p>
<p>北平倒底是古都自然有它熱鬧的地方單說六國飯店這一家由你上海什麽規模宏大的旅館都没它來得宏大不過就整個的北平城說來說北平城像一些什麽我說最好的比喻就是說北平像一個破碎的蜜蜂窠</p>
<p>大部分的北平的房子是破舊衰落得不堪的火車擦肩進了城兩旁近近遠遠全是些土屋使人看見了眞要奇怪想這就是北平北地的房子不很有樓大部分是平屋這更易使人覺得陋小不過北平的房子雖然陋小却有另一種風調使人愛北平大部分的住家房子大門口總是一列的有如下幾種顔色那就是閃亮的金碧綠血紅鳥黑或者再是一些淡黄自然就是頂考究的皇宫裏的殿也不過由以上這幾種顔色調配成功的顔色來得「鮮一使人見了便怪覺得神氣北平的房子是非常龐大的但是當眞進了屋裏面倒又非常巧小帶一些日本房子的情調使人住了覺得安適</p>
<p>自從遷都以來北平便天天在鬧着「繁榮北平」和「如何繁榮北平」的問題現在北平的房子眞便宜有那末十塊錢一個月可以租到好幾間房子了並且有許多王府的花園很大很大化上一萬或八千這生意就成交北平現在有許多房子是没有人住没有要買的就如剛才說有一萬塊錢可以買到一宅大花園可是你要在好好收拾那花園便得化上十萬或八萬合算嗎不</p>
<p>北平的巿面現在眞蕭條據說自從遷都來天津還可以維持到五成北平便可憐得衹能維持到兩三成了失業的人格外加多單說黄包車便宜得可驚我舉個例你聽比如從西直門到海甸燕京大學約摸有十五里的路程平均要化上一個多鐘頭才拉得到這樣遥長的路不過兩毛錢你想在上海不至少也得五六毛嗎</p>
<p>說起黄包車我想不再有别的地方的黄包車比北平的夠考究了北平的洋車不像上海那樣的簡陋簡直比上海的都還考究人坐在車子上眞舒適要有時風大車子上還可以張起另外一種棉的蓬有門帘使你坐在蓬裏没一絲風據說北平的黄包車不像上海一樣車子是由公司裏租來的他們車子大部分就是自己的産業所以在北平做一個黄包車夫似乎還得籌一筆本錢才能做</p>
<p>北平的電車眞乘不得那樣不乾凈那樣的没秩序電車上是不分頭等和三等的就是坐電車的人還没有上海三等乘客一樣的整齊大部分是軍人以及一些非知識階級者人坐在車裏一種氣息便夠難聞太陽晒在車廂廟灰塵看得清像無數條小虫在空中飛</p>
<p>北地的店面和江南又兩樣普通是兩開間的門面一列的裝着玻璃的長窗每一開間有一個門每個門上都吊着很重很重的棉門帘這是因爲北邊風沙大的緣故要是到了春夏我想這門帘總得該拿掉了</p>
<p>說起北平的商店便很容易記念起北地的商人我得說脾氣頂壞頂壞的商人便得推江浙比如說上海比較大的一些店家還好店員們還客氣那一般小店家店員們眞没有一些商人道德的修養要是你不跑上他店的門他們拿你没法要是你跑上了他店問他一個價彷彿你便得非做成這筆生意不可上海有許多店單那店員們的一張勢利的臉我相信便會得駭退不少顧客的在北地便全兩樣北地商家的店員之和氣眞少見你進去了不論你做一個錢生意做幾百幾千塊生意或者不要什麽東西大部分他們的招待是一列的一列的和氣没有一些些勢利的臉色没有一些些神氣可以使顧客們心裏不高興你要愛稍爲坐坐他們就立刻將茶洒了來你愛問什麽愛知道付麽他們决不會覺得你麻煩總是非常和氣地盡情的告訴你的要是你去了送到你門口爲你開門說一聲客氣話十足的一個四十五度的鞠躬這樣送别了他們的主顧</p>
<p>北地的人絶不是像江南的人一樣的刁滑輕浮的他們率直乾脆誠懇着實講義氣肯負責任我相信以一個江南的人到了北地不自然而然地也會對朋友忠實辦事員負責起來的人不是絶對没有天良的動物北地的人那一付老實便得感動你感動你到心</p>
<p>記得有一次我和一個朋友關君從前門過看見馬路上走着一排駝駱關君說北方人的最好的象徵便是駱駝因爲它馴它笨它耐勞沉重</p>
<p>我覺得這話眞不差</p>
<p>至於說天氣則和江南也兩樣好比說現在江南正是明媚春光時分但北平北平的春來得比較的遲北平的春差不多總要到四月裏才來但一來就接着去像一位很嬌很嬌的小姐一樣不肯多留一些</p>
<p>北平最長的季候便是冬其次則夏秋秋最短了在北平考究是不用得有皮袍子的最好是做一件絲棉袍子因爲絲棉這東西分量輕着在身上舒服出去時將皮大衣一披圍巾一圍皮帽一帶皮手套一套這樣即使冷也夠對付了因爲北地的人家差不多家家都生火的要是你着了皮袍子在路上或者剛好一到了屋裏便又嫌太熱所以歸根說頂好是穿西裝要是穿中裝又没大衣常常便是在棉袍子外面再套上一件皮袍子</p>
<p>我又没在北平過過夏據說北平到夏天便熱得要死說北平的房子裏要是不生火爐便得就裝起冰箱來也許這是過度的話</p>
<p>北平的話是堅乾脆呌人愛聽但眞眞的十足道地的北平士話呌人愛聽但眞懂的我初起在北平吃飯便是最不慣的一件事因爲我不能點菜茶房說的菜名我全不懂我想點的菜茶房又聽了莫名其妙所以衹能瞎子走路碰着爲來數</p>
<p>北平的葷菜其原料大部分是牛肉豬肉鷄鴨羊鷄蛋等類魚和蝦是不大有的至於飯普通是用麵頭米飯也有還有一種細米粥在江南人初初吃來我倒覺得很有趣味的</p>

<h3>紅屋素描（一）</h3>
<p>— 默之</p>
<p>我獨居在丁大學附近的一座寄宿舍裏到現今計算起時日足足地己有三個年頭了我的生活很不安定窮愁的運命緊緊地繞繚我底周身尤其是過去的兩年中我是嘗盡了意外的風雨摧殘當然使我的青春有似雲烟般的消逝使我的容顔比諸黄花還要憔悴因此我感覺人生的乏味但在第一個時期我也追溯到古今中外的豪傑志士没有一個－至少大多數－不是從甘苦困難中奮鬥出來的人生本來是無有絲毫意義的但是能夠發奮前進從黑黯裏摸索到光明的盡頭那麽也會在極無意義的波光中尋找到眞義這種不可捉摸似的幻覺是嘗活現在我的腦筋中而籍以自慰但據我經騐所得知道現宇宙間的事事物物大都不能與人性的理想合流所以過去的我是這樣現在的我也是這樣在它三年間我未曾有一次的遷移孤獨地一人居住在這小小的一座紅樓裏没有一點波動也無非是爲了上述的這個原故說起來我又感到一派不能言述的隱痛我的身世也太凄凉了</p>
<p>這座紅屋或許和我身前有相當的緣分它雖然外表還有可觀但是因爲年代太久的關係總失了一種新鮮的氣象不過它在××道上是最爲著名的袛要說起這紅屋差不多没有一個人不知似的就是乘黄包車衹要說拉到「紅屋」但他决不會亂拉到另一座紅屋的門首因此這紅屋就成爲它專一的名稱了我住在這裏是在三年前將考進這大學的時候經過一個舊同學的介紹就搬在這裏來了起初所給予我的即是一種良好的印象大有「一見傾心」的槪念同時我的本性很懦弱無論什麽都以和善待人師長愛我朋友愛我或許是爲了這個原因吧在處世方面我也覺得這種心情是不能應付現社會的一切環境所謂弱者即是「無用」我的本性如此那衹有永遠地「無用」下去了假使在「仁義」的立塲上來說我是没有負過愛我的師友的所以我居住於此房東以及同居</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>此屋的同學們對我都很了解而且很合作得來住此三年從没有發生過意外的變化和人們的口舌這在短短的生命史上也是值得紀仿的一頁了</p>
<p>因爲我經濟環境的惡劣有時甚至發生「無飯喫」的恐慌雖然這在求學青年的生涯之中己成爲一般的最普遍的現象了不過我或許是嘗受意外的風霜最深的一個很少度過比較安定的生活不是計畫今後事業上的發展就是愁慮最近及將來如何使清苦的時日消游這些在我似水的心情中浮動成爲慣常的一般那裏還能安穩地讀書或著述呢青年人本來應該向上的發展一切困難與甘苦都不該顧忌前途雖是渺茫如果努力不斷地去奮鬭也會得到光明的顯現吧不過在某種環境之下也會使青年的心趨於衰頽走向消極的道路其實現宇宙中的事物就這樣地予盾着在</p>
<p>我在這座紅屋裏以各種情景觀察之却産生了不少的可歌可泣事致少在生活史中有許多使人傷感的事值得加以紀念在此因爲窮常常連餓一兩天飯呌茶房緊緊地將房門鎖着獨自一人城在寫稿成幻想或睡覺甚至傷感到了極度會歌吟悲哀的詩不自然地　陶大哭起來如果這時有人看見我會發笑會同情也會說我的神經是起了變化自怨自己不是詩人然而詩人的本質似乎具了一些所以我道樣的一個不長進人那裏值得人們異外的愛護爲我對人以忠誠的態度熱情的心腸才能引起師友們的同情援助就是這裏的茶房他也能深深地了解我的心他敬慕我他鼓勵我使之向前突進爲事業而努力在現今雖然在人與人之間免不掉「身分」之别但是他以眞情的來鼓勵我人非木石我當然也同情於他了這茶房爲人很忠實年紀約摸有四十餘歲他有時對於同學們侍候稍有不周到了處就要遭受不能入耳的言辭如長上訓斥小輩一樣他覺得自己的「身分」如此也袛得忍着隱痛做他應盡的職務因爲我對他比較和善些所以他有不能言述的苦衷就來向我哭訴說起他底身世却大有「今昔之感」我回顧自己兩人的地位雖然不同但所受的遭遇却没有異樣我說「袛有屈服些吧」爲了這樣茶房贊頌我爲這紅屋裏最好的一位住客了</p>
<p>上海一地所謂房東的面孔是最難看的但他一副帶着假虎具的面孔是專對窮苦的青年會客所施用的假使積欠他底房租太多那他就一點也不客氣天天向你追索實際這些房客因爲窮不能按月照付决不是故意的爲之拖欠房東對於這等青年的所必然的苦衷是無論如何不會推想到的在某種情形之下還要對房客下一次嚴重的哀的美敦書如果遇到强崛的廣東性的青年房客那也不容許你這樣結果當然免不掉一場吵閙所謂勝利母須說是屬於房東的一面因爲積欠房租總成爲不可掩被的事實了我住在這裏可以算是最久的一位房客說起欠錢或許也要首推於我因爲經濟的鎖鍊對我實在太不留情面了袛是緊緊地鎖着使之不能輾轉最近半年來比較鬆弛一些所積欠的房租也陸續拔還了一些不過這位房東對我却始終是忠誠的和譪的善意的却很少向我追索過去的積欠這樣却愈使我心情的不安總覺得有些對不起的樣子向他感激也無從表白起袛有深深地銘諸内心吧了他也曉得我是個比較有爲的青年將來在事業上或許有一點希望由此他就深深地了解我的窮了同時他和我在談話之中常時規勸我窮並不是羞而且青年人多吃一些苦也不打緊袛不要堕落就好了這話的忠直却一些也不逆耳我也深深地銘記於心中眞的這樣同情窮苦青年的房東在上海一地似乎是很少見到最低限度他對於我是表示萬分的同情的了解的我怎樣不感激於他呢</p>
<p>據說這房東是在上海Ｘ洋行裏辦事並不靠這紅屋的租費而維持日常的生活而且他是一個受過高等敎育的人曾在一爿ＸＸ報館裏辦過事所以他對於青年房客能夠有以了解他年紀也有三十餘那處世之深當然較深於未曾入世的我們了每逢星期六他總要回到這紅屋一次在回來時又必定走到我房間裏來作一次長譚打聽我的近况如果我陷於愁悶之中他還以一顆熱誠的心來安慰我他是以我爲弟弟看待施與朋友的交誼這樣的房東實在不易得到當然我也以一片青年的熱誠而報答於他了和他合不來的房客是很怨恨他的而且居住這裏半載或數月移它處去的是不下若干人因爲這樣這裏的房客是愈弄愈少了我居住這裏有這樣的久遠一方面是感於房東的待我以熱誠一方面實被經濟力的阻止使我不能顫動積欠他底租金太多有時寫點稿子去賣得到相當的收入因所欠得太多收入有限總是前吃後空不能補足以前的種種這就是說前賬還了後賬倒又堆積起來了挖肉補瘡怎濟於事我的錢以「良心」來說實在没有爛用分文就是小酌遊玩都爲朋輩所請他們曉得我窮在各方面對我却有以顧到無形之中給予我一種暗助力這我在内心衹有向他們感激膜拜除此之外我却没有其它的能力來報答於他們了在這種情形之下如果我要享受一種新的生活却須待鐵樹的開花了吧但在我心願亦不很高對於這些也没有過奢的希冀也不硬着頭皮去强求還是自己嘗着凄苦的平淡的滋味爲了這種種關係我是久住於這座小小的紅屋裏了</p>

        <h1>1931.04.20</h1>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang and his wife returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 19th and went to the official residence of the headquarters to rest. In the afternoon, Wang Chonghui and Sun Ke visited him to discuss the draft of the Provisional Constitution and the Central Government's general proposal for the National Assembly. It was decided that a meeting would be held at the Central Party Headquarters on the afternoon of the 21st, which Chiang would also attend. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Negotiations for the Recovery of Legal Rights</h3>
<p>British and French Envoys Exchange Opinions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Although there has been some progress in the Sino-British legal rights issue, there is still no satisfactory result. The British Ambassador Lampson and his counselors went for a walk in the suburbs on the morning of the 19th, and will continue discussions in the afternoon of the 20th. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhengting visited Chiang on the 19th and reported on the latest trends in the negotiations for the recovery of legal rights. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British Ambassador Lampson and French Ambassador Wilden had lunch at the League of Nations Society at noon on the 19th, and then went to the British Embassy to exchange opinions on the legal rights issue. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that the articles of the "Measures for the Management of Litigation Involving Foreign Nationals" drafted by our side have been translated into English and French. The content has been briefly communicated to the British Ambassador, with the intention of asking the country not to worry too much about litigation cases involving British nationals in the concessions after the abolition of consular jurisdiction. The British Ambassador expressed understanding, but requested that the Shanghai International Settlement be treated as an exception, and that the term could be shortened. Our side agreed to consider this. Furthermore, the French Ambassador recently telegraphed his government to request instructions on the final measures, but a reply has not yet been received. The French Ambassador's attitude has remained slow recently. The reason is that the country's voluntary reform of the existing extraterritorial rights is far from our proposed overall abolition. If there is a glimmer of hope, our side is also unwilling to unilaterally declare a standstill in negotiations with France. Moreover, in the Sino-American negotiations, the American government is watching the intentions of the United Kingdom. Therefore, the current attitude of the United Kingdom has a considerable influence on the overall situation of the legal rights negotiations. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Situation of Sino-Russian Negotiations</h3>

Moreover, Zhu and Mao believe that Peng and Huang have surrendered, and Zhu De intends to flee to Sichuan. Therefore, conflicts have intensified and they are becoming increasingly disintegrated. The bandits' food can at most support them for one month. The military's morale is shaken and panic is rising. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) External news: there are reports that the Gan bandits have collapsed and fled to Tingzhou in Fujian Province. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun ordered Li Mingzhong, Xu Yuanquan, and Wang Jinyu to separately eliminate the remnant bandits in various border areas and prevent them from spreading. At the same time, he ordered the Qingxiang General Bureau, the Security Office, the Civil Affairs Department, and the Relief Committee to handle the Qingxiang, disaster relief, and all follow-up work.

The rest were preparing millions to provide temporary assistance. Outside rumors about the Jin-Sui issue are not true. On the Sino-Russian issue, Russia accepted the proposal to redeem the road and is estimating the price. China's northern finances have a solution. Special taxes will be discussed and decided after going to Nanjing. He intends to submit a concrete report on the military and political affairs of the Northeast Army to the National Assembly.

<h2>Page 4</h2>

<h3>Measures for Reorganizing Jin Currency</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain committee said that Jin's request to issue 24 million financial bonds is actually difficult because the original proposal of 6 million yuan per year from Shanxi Likin could be used as collateral. If it is issued now and the guarantee is not in place, it will be difficult to sell the bonds. Therefore, the method of reorganizing Jin banknotes should be planned by the province. First, the market price should be determined. If the banknotes are priced according to the regulations and are never allowed to fall below that price, then the circulation on the market will be reorganized without being reorganized. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mining Disputes on the Kaining Railway</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Kai Mining Company has owed the Kaining Railway more than 1.5 million yuan in freight charges, which have been delayed for non-payment. The dispute between the two sides has been going on for three months. Yang Jiali, a director of the mine, has been lobbying everywhere, trying to win over Kaining, but without success. The call from all walks of life to take back the mining rights is getting louder and louder, and the strike at the Linxi Coal Mine is also affecting the entire mine. Recently, a lot of coal from Jingxing, Changcheng, Mentougou, and other places has been transported to Tianjin. The Kai mine has fallen into a difficult situation. On the 18th, an emergency temporary board meeting was held and it was decided that from the 19th, all mining areas such as Zhaogezhuang, Linxi, and Majiagou would be suspended for four months, intending to make hundreds of thousands of workers unemployed and cause disturbances to force the Kaining Railway to submit. The northern sales office of the mine, which is the general agency for coal sales, will also be closed on the 20th. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Han Fuju Returns to Jinan</h3>

The attack will be launched for two days yesterday and today, and the bandits will be surrounded in Baodugu. It is not difficult to solve, but the four counties of Feitengyi and Linyi have suffered too much from the bandit disasters and must be handled as four special zones in the future to provide relief and appease the displaced people. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Spanish Government Reorganizes the Army</h3>
<p>The first thing the new government of Spain has done after its establishment is to reorganize the army. According to today's telegram, the current government plans to completely reorganize the current army and eliminate 800 generals and 26,000 officers, so that all officers will belong to the reliable Republican Party. The existing security forces will also be disbanded because they have a reactionary color. This is naturally because the past coups in Spain were manipulated by the military. In the past political situation in Spain, politicians and political parties borrowed the power of the military to brew coups, and then the military took advantage of the opportunity of political changes to compete with each other. Therefore, the army was raised more and more, and the rulers gradually reached the point where they could not command, and the chaos became more and more unsettled. Therefore, the new government is eager to seize military power in the hands of the Republican Party at the beginning of its organization to seek unity and eliminate reaction cannot be said to be a method of pacifying the chaos. However, it is not easy for a government to own such a huge armed force and a large number of soldiers and want to make them obey orders without being used and instigated by other factions. Moreover, it is not a long-term solution to still regard armed force as the only means of governing the country after the establishment of the republic. The former King of Spain also claimed to be good at using armed force and good at driving military men, but the battle of Morocco can be said to have used all his strength and eventually failed. Since this failure, the national power has suddenly weakened and the people's hearts have gradually been lost. Recently, dealing with the Revolutionary Party can also be said to be suppressing with all its strength, but not only is the storm not calm, but the military is also gradually less used, until it abdicates and then only itself. In short, the new government will not substantially improve politics in the future, but will still pay attention to armed force, thinking that success can be achieved by taking military power into the hands of the government party, which is far from the republic.</p>

<p>Havana, 18th, National News Agency: Cuban President General Machado announced that martial law will be lifted throughout the country starting Monday, ending the military monitoring system.

The Liberal, Conservative, and People's Parties jointly requested Ma to extend his term by two years, but Ma expressed that his national salvation plan could not be completed without another six years. Therefore, the parties devised a way to amend the constitution and jointly recommended Ma as the joint presidential candidate of the three parties.

The defense areas of each warship are as follows: Haihu Warship and Anbei Warship cruise the Bay of Biscay and the coast of Huichao; Zhongyuan Warship patrols the area from Liede Yuzhou Dongpu to Huangpu; Leigan Warship patrols the area from Huangpu to Lianhuashan Danshui River; Baobi Warship patrols the area from Lianhuashan to Huangpu; Qiaoxing Warship patrols the area from the mouth of the East River to Xintang; Haikang Warship patrols the area from Lianhuashan Batangwei to Guanyinzha; Hushan Warship and Jiangcheng Warship patrol the area from Guanyinzha to Lijia Sand; Yingjie Warship patrols the area from Sanliankou to Chencun; Yuexing Warship patrols the area from Chencun to Haozhou; Zhunji Warship patrols the area from Haozhou to Tanzhou; Pingxi Warship patrols the area from Rongqi to Yinggezui; Zhili Warship patrols the area from Yinggezui to Dongxi Maning; Guang'an Warship patrols the area from Dongxi Maning to Sanlisha; Guangdong Warship patrols the area from Sanlisha to Jiujiang; Jiangshun Warship patrols the area from Haozhou Sanhongqi to Huanglian; Haineng Warship patrols the area from Sanhongqi Juhuawan to Lelou; Suijiang Warship and Guanghua Warship patrol the area from Lelou to Qikou Ganzhutan; Anxin Warship patrols the area from Lelou to Fengjian; Chonghe Haiou Warship patrols the area from Yinggezui Xiaolan to Baihuatou; Haiping Warship patrols the area from Sanlisha to Zhutoushan; Jinma Warship patrols the outer sea of Jiangmen Tadongwei Sanjiangkou Baiqingsha to Zhuzhoutou; Beijiang Warship patrols the area from Nantoushi to Nicheng; The Jiangda Jianggong Jianggu and other warships are general patrol warships. The cities of Wuzhou are still stationed with warships such as Zhixin Pingxi, etc. to assist the 8th Route Army stationed in Wuzhou to defend the security of Wuzhou. (Night of April 9th)</p>
<h3>The Process of Issuing the Haihe Public Bond</h3>
<p>Tianjin Communication: Tianjin is an important commercial town in North China and the former gateway to the capital. Since the great flood of 1917, the Haihe River has been silting up year by year. In the spring and autumn seasons, ships with a draft of ten feet cannot enter from Dagu. After 1926, the siltation became more and more serious. The Haihe Engineering Bureau, operated by foreigners, purchased eight dredging machines and ships, spending more than one million yuan every year, but the dredging was followed by siltation, and no inch of effect was seen, so that the famous foreign water conservancy experts could only sigh at the river. In 1928, as soon as Shang Zhen took office as the head of Hebei Province, he made river management the top priority. He hired experts to formulate a plan, with a fundamental cure cost of more than 20 million yuan and a symptomatic cure cost of 4 million yuan. He believed that the symptomatic cure was the most urgent task. The Hebei Provincial Government, the Tianjin Municipal Government, the North China Water Conservancy Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the Construction Committee and other institutions jointly formed the Haihe River Consolidation Committee. The provincial chairman and the mayor were the president and vice president. They advocated the issuance of the Haihe River Consolidation Public Bond of 4 million yuan. This happened in October 1928. Due to the disputes over the rights and interests of various parties, it was not until May 15, 1929, that the national government promulgated the public bond regulations. The bond interest was 8%. The banks that underwrote the bonds paid at a rate of 98. The principal and interest were repaid on April 20 and October 20 every year. April 1 and October 1 every year were the dates for drawing lots to repay the principal. 200,000 yuan was drawn each time and paid off in ten years. The 25% surtax on the Tianjin Customs and the national treasury coupons were used as collateral, and the 8% of the 5% regular tax on Tianjin Customs was used as the repayment of principal and interest (ie, 4 corners were added to every 5 yuan of regular tax). The average monthly income was about 90,000 yuan. This bond was issued from June 17, 1929, and the bonds could have been issued as scheduled. However, the Ministry of Finance designated the Central Bank as the agent for depositing the fund and managing the repayment of principal and interest. At that time, Tianjin had not yet established a Central Bank, so it was naturally deposited in the China and Jiaotong Banks. However, other banks also requested to share the deposit of the fund, so the Jin Cheng Salt Industry Zhongnan Mainland Four Banks were added. As the consolidation of the Haihe River was also related to foreigners, foreign banks also requested to join, so the Banque Franco-Chinoise was allowed to join. Finally, the Hebei Provincial Bank also joined due to its local relationship. It took several months to resolve the dispute over equal benefits. When the bond coupons were about to be issued last spring, a change occurred in the overall situation. The central government was deeply concerned that Yan Xishan would allocate the funds to military expenses and ordered the suspension of the issuance of public bonds, but the surtax of the customs was not stopped. After Yan Feng was defeated, the Haihe River Consolidation Committee applied to the Ministry of Finance for permission to issue public bonds, which was extended until last month. At that time, the president and vice president Wang Shuchang and Zang Qifang were both in Shenyang. It was not until the 28th Standing Committee meeting opened on the 11th of this month that the important agenda was to issue public bonds. It was decided to send Committee members Han Linsheng, Secretary-General Huang Zongfa, and Accounting Director Ye Jingshen to contact the banking community for underwriting bonds and depositing funds. In addition to the above-mentioned eight banks, the Tianjin branch of the Central Bank had already opened on the 10th of this month, so it was also invited to join, for a total of nine banks. The bond coupons currently issued are less than 3 million yuan, because the bond coupons have been drawn four times, and 800,000 yuan for the four drawings must be removed. Also, last year, the Consolidation Committee presented to the Ministry of Finance for approval to use 300,000 yuan of bond coupons to offset 300,000 yuan in foreign currency due to the need for project funds. Therefore, only 2.9 million yuan can be issued at present. As a result of the contact between Han Linsheng and the banking community, there is no problem with underwriting the bonds, but there are still objections to the deposit of funds because the banking side cannot agree to Article 7 of the underwriting contract. According to a certain gentleman from the Consolidation Committee, the committee members are aiming to issue the public bonds as soon as possible, and it has been decided to delete Article 7. It is estimated that the public bonds will be approved for issuance within this week. (April 14th)</p>
<h3>Gu Ziyi's Embezzlement Case Judgment (Continued)</h3>
<p>The reasoning behind this case is as follows: Although the defendant, Gu Ziyi, claimed that the fine of over 120,000 yuan was kept on behalf of Xin Bosen's orders and denied any joint embezzlement, based on various evidences, the court believes that the defendant did commit the act of embezzlement. The details are as follows: According to the defendant's testimony in this court, according to the usual procedures of Tianjin Customs, all taxes or fines paid by merchants are sent to the Jiaotong Bank with a remittance slip for deposit. The bank fills out a deposit slip separately. Usually, the remittance slip and the deposit slip are kept in the accounting room. One day, when a foreign cloth merchant paid a fine of more than 10,000 yuan, Xin Bosen called me to his office and said that although general taxes should be deposited in Jiaotong Bank, this kind of fine is a special income and can be deposited separately. So we changed the deposit of the fine to the Banque de l'Indochine. Since then, he taught me to keep the remittance slip and he kept the deposit slip, etc. It is found that all taxes or fines collected by Tianjin Customs should be deposited in Jiaotong Bank. This is the usual practice of the customs. Since Gu Ziyi and Xin Bosen took office, they disregarded the precedent and privately changed the deposit of fines to the Banque de l'Indochine, which was obviously a prelude to embezzlement. Moreover, according to the defendant, the remittance slip and the deposit slip were usually kept in the accounting room, but after the deposit of fines was changed, these vouchers were kept privately by the defendant and Xin Bosen, which cannot be said to be a premeditated embezzlement. This is sufficient to prove that the defendant embezzled. It is found that the deposits of Tianjin Customs in Jiaotong Bank were originally marked as fines and confiscations. The defendant and Xin Bosen changed the deposit to the Banque de l'Indochine and changed the name to "Tax Bureau Local Savings" to indicate personal ownership, which shows their intention to embezzle. Although the defendant Gu Ziyi excused himself as Xin Bosen's doing, the deposit affairs were handled by the defendant, and the defendant has clearly admitted it. Therefore, the change of the deposit slip name must have been the defendant's common intention. The defendant relied on Xin Bosen's death without proof and insisted that he knew nothing about it, which is difficult to believe. This is sufficient to prove the defendant's embezzlement (2). Reviewing the case files, Gu Zifan confessed in the early days of his arrest at the Public Security Bureau of this city that Xin Bosen gave his brother more than 120,000 yuan, half to his brother and half to him (referring to Xin Bosen) for his needs after leaving office. It shows that the defendant Gu Ziyi and Xin Bosen had a joint plan to share the spoils, which was also confirmed by the accomplice Gu Zifan. This is sufficient to prove the defendant's embezzlement (3). According to the defendant Gu Ziyi, I heard that Xin Bosen was assassinated by opium merchants for revenge, and I also heard that the National Government had ordered my arrest, so I went to Dalian on October 8 to avoid temporarily, not to embezzle fines and run away, etc. However, it is found that the Tianjin Customs Office had been recovered by the National Government on October 2 last year, and all personnel appointed by Ge Xishan must hand over all matters. At that time, Xin Bosen was injured in the assassination and could not get up. The defendant, as the deputy commissioner, should have gone to the customs to clearly hand over the fines he handled as required before he could be relieved of his responsibilities. However, the defendant held a large amount of money and did not hand it over to the customs, and secretly went to Dalian to hide. Who would believe that it was not embezzlement of fines and fleeing in fear of crime? This is sufficient to prove the defendant's embezzlement (4). According to the defendant, Xin Bosen gave me the money, and I spent several thousand yuan. I deposited 30,000 yuan in the Zhongnan Bank with my own old Gu Jian seal to earn interest, etc. It is that the defendant has spent the fines of Tianjin Customs that he handled by himself and deposited them in the bank in his own name to earn interest. He has disposed of other people's property in his possession and has the intention of illegally obtaining it and changing it to his own. It is also in line with the elements of the crime of embezzlement. This is sufficient to prove the defendant's embezzlement (5). Based on the above points, cross-referencing and cross-examination, the defendant Gu Ziyi's embezzlement of Tianjin Customs fines is undoubtedly true. However, whether the defendant's identity at the time of the crime was a public official as defined in the criminal law and whether what he embezzled was public property should be discussed separately. It is found that the public official mentioned in Article 17 of the Criminal Law refers to officials and other personnel engaged in public affairs according to laws and regulations. The defendant Gu Ziyi in this case was appointed as the deputy commissioner of Tianjin Customs Office by Yan Xishan on June 20 last year, after the National Government had clearly deprived Yan Xishan of his official position (according to the government gazette, Yan Xishan was dismissed on April 5, 19). Yan Xishan himself lost the status of a national official due to being ordered to be dismissed, and according to law, he had no right to reappoint officials. In fact, Yan's appointment of Gu Ziyi as the deputy commissioner of Tianjin Customs was fundamentally illegal and invalid. Therefore, the defendant Gu Ziyi cannot be regarded as a staff member engaged in public affairs according to laws and regulations, and cannot be regarded as a public official under the criminal law. The prosecutor's indictment stated that Gu Ziyi was appointed by Yan Xishan and cannot be regarded as a public official, which is justified. However, it is found that the crime in Article 357 of the Criminal Law is not limited to public officials. Anyone who embezzles public property can constitute this crime even if they are not officials (see Interpretation No. 195 and No. 1665 of the former Dali Yuan). Although Gu Ziyi in this case cannot be regarded as having the identity of a public official, he actually collected taxes in the Tianjin Customs Office affiliated to the central government, and the affairs he handled were public affairs. Therefore, his act of embezzling taxes cannot be regarded as ordinary or business embezzlement, and should still constitute the crime of embezzling public property. As for the part of the indictment that the defendant embezzled miscellaneous fines of more than 10,000 yuan, Gu Ziyi confessed that this money was punished by the former customs because the former customs personnel had all resigned and there was no way to issue bonuses, so he ordered the accountant not to enter the accounts and specially took out this money to purchase three public cars. These cars have been returned to the customs during the handover and have not been embezzled, etc. According to Song Kecheng, the chief secretary of the Tianjin Customs Tax Bureau, Gu Ziyi did return three cars to the customs. According to the complaint of Lu Liji, the tax commissioner of Tianjin Customs, it is also said that the three cars were recovered, which is true. It is not unreasonable for Gu Ziyi to say that he did not embezzle the above-mentioned fines of more than 10,000 yuan, etc. In addition, regarding the defendant's destruction of documents, the defendant confessed that he did not conceal books and did not damage documents, etc. However, it is found that the fine books handled by the defendant were not handed over to the successors, and many of them were missing and incomplete, and there were damages. The Tianjin Customs Office has investigated and clearly provided proof that the defendant destroyed documents and concealed books in an attempt to destroy the evidence of the crime. It is impossible to listen to his sophistry. Based on the above conclusions, the defendant Gu Ziyi in this case, except for the part of the miscellaneous fines of more than 10,000 yuan that there is no suspicion of embezzlement and should be exempted from discussion, his embezzlement of public property and destruction of public documents constitute the crimes of Article 357, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and Article 380 of the same law. However, it is found that the destruction of documents is a method of embezzlement, and according to Article 74, the heavier punishment should be imposed. It is also found that the defendant embezzled fines of more than 120,000 yuan, which is a serious circumstance. According to Articles 42, 51 and 76, the maximum term of imprisonment of five years and a fine of 3,000 yuan shall be imposed within the scope of punishment of Article 357, Paragraph 1 above. If the fine cannot be paid after compulsory execution, according to Articles 55, 234, each item shall be converted into one day of imprisonment at a rate of three yuan, but the imprisonment period shall not exceed one year. The number of days of detention before the judgment is determined shall be converted into one day of imprisonment for every two days according to Article 64. It is also found that the defendant Gu Zifan confessed in the Public Security Bureau that when my brother left, he gave me two deposit books of Luo's Longji, saying that these two amounts should be instructed by Yan Xishan before they can be disposed of, so I went to Shanxi to ask for instructions, but I stayed in Shanxi for a few days and did not see Yan Xishan, so I came back to wait, etc. The testimony in this court is also roughly the same, and he also said that I took out 15,000 yuan from the National Bank and I kept 3,000 yuan for my own use, etc. It is found that when Gu Ziyi gave the Luo's Longji deposit book to Gu Zifan, he said that it must be instructed by Yan Xishan before it can be disposed of. Therefore, although he has expressed the intention of embezzlement for this deposit amount, the degree of his embezzlement has not reached completion. At this time, the defendant Gu Zifan went to Taiyuan to ask for instructions on how to share the spoils and took the initiative to withdraw money for his own use to keep the deposit book. According to Articles 44, Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the same law, the crime of helping to embezzle public property should also be established. According to Article 76, a term of imprisonment of three years and a fine of 2,000 yuan shall be imposed on Article 357, Paragraph 1. If the fine cannot be paid after compulsory execution, according to Articles 55, 234, each item shall be converted into one day of imprisonment at a rate of three yuan, but the imprisonment period shall not exceed one year. The number of days of detention before the judgment is determined shall be converted into one day of imprisonment for every two days according to Article 64. It is also reported that Lu Liji, the tax commissioner of Tianjin Customs, filed an incidental civil lawsuit on behalf of Tianjin Customs in the criminal proceedings of this case, requesting the defendants to compensate a special fine of 123,778.91 yuan and a miscellaneous fine of 10,713.83 yuan, and ordering the defendants to hand over the fine books they handled, etc. This court finds that according to the principles of civil law, several people who jointly commit a crime and obtain property belonging to others shall bear joint and several liability for returning the property. Also, a person who is injured by a crime may request any of the joint offenders to restore all of his damages. The defendant and Xin Bosen jointly embezzled Tianjin Customs fines as described above, and the embezzled 123,778.91 yuan has been handed over to the defendant for safekeeping by Xin Bosen. Therefore, the plaintiff's representative's request to order the defendants to compensate 123,778.91 yuan is justified. It is also found that the books of administrative agencies should be handed over to the successors for receipt, which is also a matter of course. The defendants in this case privately took out and concealed the books in order to destroy the evidence of the crime of embezzlement, which is obviously improper. They should also be ordered to hand over the fine books they handled to the Tianjin Customs Office for collection. However, it has been verified that the miscellaneous fines were used to purchase cars, and the cars have been returned to the customs. Therefore, it is difficult to order the defendants to bear the responsibility for compensation. The incidental civil lawsuit is considered unreasonable on this point and should be rejected. Therefore, the judgment is made according to Articles 315, 506 and 509 of the Criminal Procedure Law as the main text.</p>
<p>This case was executed by Tu Zhang, the prosecutor of this court, performing the duties of the prosecutor. The court of appeal in this case is the Hebei Higher Court, and the time limit is ten days, starting from the date of delivery of the judgment. April 14, 20th year of the Republic of China.

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>Bandits at Baodu Ridge Are Surrounded</h3>
<p>Jinan Telegraph: The bandits at Baodu Ridge are now surrounded by a large army on all sides and have no way to escape. They are thinking of making a desperate struggle, relying on the mountains and ravines, digging stone caves and drilling gun holes to resist stubbornly. There are no less than ten groups of bandits, each group numbering two to three hundred or five to six hundred. After Han Fuqu and Wang Jun and Chen Yaohan agreed on a plan to suppress the bandits in Zaozhuang, they transferred three steel armored vehicles from Beiping, Heping, and Taishan to patrol between Yanzhou and Xuzhou. Jiang Chuou, the commander of the steel armored vehicles, also arrived in Lincheng to inspect and ordered Wang Haoding to lead a column of combat vehicles to assist in the suppression. The bandits at Juliang Ridge near Linyi were bombarded by Qiao (Lizhi) Division and Zhan (Shutang) Brigade with artillery, and most of the bandits were defeated. A part of them broke through the encirclement and fled to Yishui. Troops have now been sent to chase them. Chen Yaohan's division in Yizhou has also sent a team to block and suppress them. The text of Han Fuqu's report on the bandit situation is recorded as follows: "Notification (1) According to the report of Brigade Commander Ma, the villages in the Huangcencheng East area were searched today and the bandit situation was collected in detail (2) Division Gu is still making efforts to detect the bandit area in the south on the line of Xinzhuang, Liangqiu, and Huangshanwan. According to the report of Division Commander Gu and Brigade Commander Ma, the bandits at Baodu Ridge are relying on the mountains and ravines, digging stone caves and drilling gun holes, and are preparing to resist. The bandits' families have moved to Quangu Mountain, Xizigou, Baodu Ridge, and Jiaoshan. Bandit leader Liu Fusheng is now in the Da'an Xiaoyanzi area southwest of Chaihuoyu. Guo Mafeng is now in the Xuzhuang Sunjiazhuang Hulutao Gejiayu area. Zhang Heilian is at Qingshiling. Yin Shigui is at Bailongwan. Liu Xiaoer is at Xiaoxiangcheng. Song Chang is at Xiyangquan.

<h3>Japanese and American Merchant Ships Refusing Inspection Case</h3>
<p>Yichang Garrison Headquarters Filed a Protest</p>
<p>Hankou Telegraph: The government has stipulated that the inspection of foreign merchant ships should be handled by the customs. However, the military also has the responsibility to conduct temporary inspections within the cordon and during martial law. As a result, Japanese and American merchant ships refused to be inspected and shot and injured the guard troops. The situation is being seriously negotiated. The details of the incident are as follows, according to the investigation:</p>
<p>After Badong and Zigui were captured by the He bandits, the troops along the river announced martial law. On the 7th, the Japanese Nissin Company's merchant ship Jialing Maru passed the Sanyoudong cordon and a misunderstanding occurred because it refused to be inspected by Guo Xun's troops. A cook on the ship, Shen Adang, was injured. The Japanese Consul stationed in Yichang filed a protest with the Yichang Garrison Headquarters and issued a memorandum. On the 8th, the American merchant ship Yibin of the Yangtze Rapid Steamship Company passed the Nanjin Pass cordon and a conflict occurred because it refused to be inspected. The ship stopped and confronted, resulting in 25 casualties among the officers and soldiers. The Yichang Garrison Headquarters has handled the two cases separately. Regarding the Jialing Maru case, according to the Japanese Consul's protest and memorandum, a reply was given, saying, "I have received the letter and memorandum. I have read everything carefully. Your country's Nissin Company's Jialing Maru passed the Sanyoudong guard line of our army on the 7th of this month. Our army had previously heard that a certain ship was detained by the Badong Red bandits and was afraid that the Communists would sneak into Yichang to harm the lives and property of Chinese and foreign people. Therefore, troops were sent to guard the Nanjin Pass area and temporary inspections were conducted on the ships coming from Sichuan to Yichang in order to prevent problems before they occur. The company's Jialing Maru, having identified the troops stationed there as our army's troops, should have stopped the ship and accepted the inquiry, but instead sped up and sailed quickly, resulting in this unfortunate incident. Our commander regrets this and respectfully asks your consul to forward this to the company. As for the injured cook, Shen Adang, a doctor at Pujic Hospital said that he can be cured within ten days. Everything in the hospital will be taken care of by our troops. The damage to the hull of the Jialing Maru will be discussed with your consul in person to maintain the good relations between China and Japan in the past." Regarding the Yibin Maru's arbitrary injury to people, the Yichang Garrison Headquarters not only telegraphed the government to seriously negotiate, but also sent a letter to the Yangtze Rapid Steamship Company to question it, saying, "After Badong and Zigui were occupied by the Red bandits, the area along the river must be strictly guarded to prevent the bandits from disturbing. Recently, the 8th Regiment of the Instructor was ordered to go to Nanjin Pass to defend it. It was also reported that after the fall of Baigui, an upstream ship was detained by the bandits and planned to attack Yichang. The regiment was ordered to pay attention to the downstream ships. It was recently reported by the regiment that at 3:30 p.m. on April 8, a downstream ship passed the guard line and first swept the shore with machine guns. Seeing this situation, I thought that the Red bandits were indeed driving the ship downstream and planning to sneak into Yichang, so I opened fire in retaliation, and the ship stopped and confronted, resulting in 25 casualties among the officers and soldiers. Please verify, etc. After investigation, it was learned that today it was your company's Yibin Maru sailing downstream and the foreign workers on the ship first opened machine guns to shoot at the shore and then stopped the ship to confront, resulting in 25 casualties among the officers and soldiers of the regiment. After Baigui was occupied by the bandits, the Yichang Sichuan-Jiang Navigation Management Office telegraphed the Chongqing and Wanxian Navigation Offices on the 6th, asking all Chinese and foreign ships to temporarily stop to avoid being intercepted by the bandits. However, your company's Yibin Maru risked sailing downstream. If it was intercepted by the bandits, it would facilitate the bandits to sneak downstream and transport supplies. Although the ship sailed east and was not intercepted by the bandits, it did not investigate when passing the guard line and opened fire, causing so many casualties among the officers and soldiers. It is really inappropriate. In addition to telegraphing the government to seriously negotiate with your country's minister and our department to protest to your country's naval captain stationed in Yichang, we should also send a letter to your company for review and reply."

<h3>Reorganization and Establishment of Shenyang Chamber of Commerce and Industry</h3>
<p>Shenyang Telegraph: The Shenyang Liaoning Provincial Chamber of Commerce and Industry previously complied with the regulations of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Law to implement the division and reorganization, and re-elected the chairman, directors, supervisors, and other members. The reorganization has now been completed. The members of the two associations held a swearing-in ceremony at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry on the morning of the 14th. In addition to the representatives of various industries in the Shenyang Chamber of Commerce, Zang Shiyi, the chairman of the provincial government, and Liu Heling, the director of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, personally attended the ceremony to give instructions. The Department of Education, the Municipal Government Office, the Official Bank, and various legal entities also sent representatives to participate. At 11:10 a.m., the bell rang and the meeting began. After performing the ceremony, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the directors, the executive committee members, and the supervisors all took an oath. Then, Zang Shiyi, the chairman of the provincial government, gave a speech, saying that today is the swearing-in ceremony for the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, the executive director of the Trade Union, the executive and supervisory committee members, and the staff members. I am very honored to participate in the grand event. Recalling the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the past, due to the circumstances of the time, although there was an organization, it was not perfect. Now the Chamber of Commerce and Industry has been reorganized in accordance with the central government's laws and regulations and has been completely completed. All staff members have also been elected in accordance with the law. In the future, the development of the association will have great hope. Regarding the affairs of the two associations, I hope that the responsible personnel of the two associations will earnestly carry them out. I have no specialized knowledge of commerce and industry, but I hope that you will work together and wish the two associations a prosperous future and all members and everyone present good health. Then, Liu Heling, the director of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, gave a speech, saying that the current commercial depression is extreme. He hopes that the Chamber of Commerce will conduct research and rectification so that domestic products can compete with foreign goods. There are four points that he hopes for from the Trade Union: (1) Workers' discipline should be strict (2) Workers should pay attention to morality (3) Increase workers' knowledge (4) Mediate labor-capital conflicts. Finally, Jin Zhezhen, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, reported on the reorganization process. Lu Naigeng, the executive director of the Trade Union, gave a reply on behalf of everyone. Then, music was played and photos were taken, and the meeting dispersed. (15th)</p>
<h3>After the Partial Trade of Heihe</h3>
<p>Increased Population Density</p>
<p>Russian Goods Sell Very Well</p>
<p>Harbin Telegraph: Since the partial trade conditions were established by the Soviet Consul General in Heihe and Zhang Shou Zeng, the head of the Heihe Municipal Planning Office, in November last year and submitted to the central government for approval and implementation, the market has become increasingly prosperous. During the anti-Russian campaign in the autumn of the 18th year, many merchants and civilians in Heihe returned to the mainland to avoid harassment by the Russian army. The remaining population was less than 10,000 and there were only about 30 merchants. The desolate situation had reached its extreme. Since the implementation of partial trade, Russian goods have been imported from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe, and sales are handled by agents. There are now 50 or 60 Chinese agents who have been established one after another, and the business situation is said to be good. All the materials needed in various border areas are purchased nearby due to the inconvenience of domestic transportation. Therefore, the agents also benefit from the sales. The best-selling Russian goods are coal, kerosene, cloth, cement, and machinery. Although the agreement stipulates that it is only limited to Heihe, the Soviet Union specially set up an agency near the Russian Consulate in Heihe to manage it. Recently, it has expanded its agency to Qiqihar and Aigun, and goods are coming from various sources and are being promoted directly to the interior of Heilongjiang. After the river opens, it is feared that its influence will spread throughout the Heilongjiang and Nenjiang basins. However, the transportation of Chinese goods to Russia is subject to various difficulties by its checkpoints and is not allowed to enter the country. Therefore, although it is called partial trade, it is actually just opening a sales channel for Russia. This month, the Russian State-owned Trade Bureau also sent many investigators to investigate along the Heihe-Qiqihar Railway, and it seems that it will expand its sales market to the area along the railway.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Peng family at the bottom of Liren Lane was burglarized. The Tan Xiangqing family at the bottom of Liren Lane in the west were burglarized the day before yesterday because the whole family was guests at a relative's house. The burglar, Bailonggua, entered the house from the roof at night and rummaged through the rooms, stealing clothes and ornaments and escaping with the loot. The next day, the neighbors discovered it and informed the owner, who returned home to check and found that about 2,000 yuan was stolen. He has already filled out a loss report and reported it to the Second Precinct Police Station for investigation.</p>
<p>The Third Battalion of the Fifth Division transferred back to Shanghai. Zhang Rubil, the battalion commander of the Third Battalion of the Fifth Division and the commander of the Songjinqing Three Counties Garrison, was recently ordered to be transferred back to Shanghai for centralized training. Battalion Commander Zhang led the entire army to Shanghai on the 18th. The defense affairs of the three counties left behind were telegraphed by Commander Xiong to Director Li of the Security Office to transfer the Second Regiment Commander Cao Bang of the Security Team stationed in Songjiang to take over the defense. Commander Cao was immediately notified. Then, Commander Xiong was allowed to send a telegram saying that in the future, contact should still be made at any time regarding the defense affairs of the counties.</p>
<p>A private wooden fence was used to imprison a daughter-in-law, who was accused. Li Niankun in Fengjing married Qian Shishun, a woman from Jiashan, as his wife. Three months after the marriage, he went out to work and has not returned or been heard from since. Qian Shishun's nature is weak and she is often abused by her parents-in-law. They even privately set up a wooden fence to imprison her and used rattan canes to beat her. She was curled up in the room, dying. The neighbors complained, but the parents-in-law were still not aware of it. Qian Yanpei, the brother of the victim Qian Shishun, deeply cared for his sister and specially filed a lawsuit with the county procuratorate against Li Suotao for obstructing freedom, etc. After the police investigation, it was found that there was mental illness. Chief Prosecutor Zhu, for the sake of being serious, yesterday (18th) specially went to Fengjing with Feng Youlu, the director of the county hospital, for an autopsy. The defendant Li Suotao also claimed to be sick and bedridden. According to the autopsy results, Qian Shishun did not seem to have a mental illness. It seemed that she had already contracted consumption and her life was in great danger.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Building a Tomb for Filial Piety at Tiger Hill: Straw sheds along the Tiger Hill firing range, Xiaozimu (孝子墓), and outside the Xumen’s Reception Hall were inhabited by people from Jiangbei. A massive fire on the sixth of this month destroyed over a hundred houses and claimed thirteen lives. Among them was Zhang Er'a, who, at the age of eighty-nine, repeatedly ventured into the fire to rescue his elderly mother but failed. In the end, he knelt before his mother's corpse in the flames and sacrificed himself in filial piety. Subsequently, newspapers reported the details and published photographs, creating a sensation. Now, Suzhou residents Zhang Yiyi (張一麔), Cao Zhihan (曹智涵), and others believe that while Zhang Er'a's filial piety may have been foolish, it still deserves recognition. Therefore, they convened a meeting at Zhang Yi's residence on the afternoon of the nineteenth, resolving to build a tomb for Zhang Xiaozimu (張孝子墓) at the foot of Tiger Hill. Zhang and Cao will write the epitaph, carve it in stone, and erect a monument for future generations to see.</p>
<p>The Truth Behind the Suicide Pact at an Inn: The Dadong Inn (大東旅社) outside the Shantang Gate witnessed a suicide pact on the sixth of this month. A young traveler claiming to be Shuang Dewei (雙得慰) and a young woman committed suicide by poison and died together. Afterward, the court, public security bureau, and other agencies issued notices and sent documents to Liuhang, Yangzhou, and other places to find relatives of the deceased to claim the bodies. Initially, there was no news. However, yesterday, the wife of Lu Qi (陸起), a native of Wuxi and currently the head of the second section of the Taixian County government, returned from Tai to Wuxi and recounted the incident in detail. Cheng Yinsheng (程寅生), the manager of the Dadong Inn, obtained this information and traveled to Wuxi to inquire, learning the following details: The young woman who committed suicide was the wife of the younger brother of Li Xiao'an (李筱庵), a prominent family west of Dalin Bridge in Taixian. The family called her "Second Young Mistress." Her mother's family was also wealthy in Taixian. She married at seventeen and is now twenty-five, with a nine-year-old son and a daughter. She lost her husband at nineteen. The year before last, when bandits attacked Tai County, the former magistrate, Wang Jingtao (王景濤), fearing bandit disturbances, moved his family to Li Xiao'an's house. Feng (馮), the young and handsome head of the second section of the county government (i.e., Shuang Dewei), often visited the Li family with Magistrate Wang and became acquainted with the Second Young Mistress, and they fell in love. Eventually, the Li family discovered this and prepared to gather evidence to expel her or request the court to punish her. On the second of this month, the Second Young Mistress took approximately four thousand yuan and eloped with Feng. The two first went to Zhenjiang, then to Shanghai and Hangzhou, and arrived in Suzhou on the sixth, where they committed suicide together at the inn. It is said that before committing suicide, the Second Young Mistress sent three thousand yuan of the money she had taken back to her mother's family. The Dadong Inn has already requested the Third Sub-bureau to prepare an official letter, and the inn will send personnel to Taixian to notify the relatives to come to Suzhou to claim the coffins.</p>
<p>Director Hu Comes to Suzhou to Perform Martial Arts: Hu Pu'an (胡樸安) of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs came from Zhenjiang to Suzhou at 8:30 PM on the eighteenth to participate in the second-anniversary celebration of the Suzhou Zhiwu Martial Arts Society. That evening, he stayed at the Zhiwu Society and immediately met with County Magistrate Huang Yunzhen (黄藴深), Public Security Bureau Chief Zou Jing (鄒競), Police Captain Du Hongyi (杜鴻儀), and others, inquiring about the current state of security in Wuxian and the situation of bandits in Taihu Lake in detail. At 10:00 AM on the nineteenth, he attended the Zhiwu Society's anniversary celebration, where Hu lectured on the uses of Taijiquan and performed a set of sparring Taijiquan with Chen Weiming (陳微明). Finally, Hu performed a solo routine of Taijiquan, which was very impressive and photographed. After the meeting, Hu went to the county government to inspect and convened a meeting of public security bureau officials and county police to encourage them to be honest and serve the people. He left Suzhou at 5:00 PM to return to Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>Silk Weaving Industry Requests Exemption from Export Taxes: The silk weaving industries in Suzhou, including power looms and silk filatures, have been subject to two types of export duties on satin goods: one for goods exported to foreign countries and one for goods transported to various ports in China, such as Tianjin and Hankou, both of which require a small export duty and an import half-tax. Now, because the government is implementing tariff reduction, they submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance on the nineteenth, requesting that goods transported to foreign countries be exempt from customs duties for three years, and that goods transported to ports such as Tianjin and Hankou be permanently exempt, in order to maintain the industry.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Robbery and Assault at Lengshuiwan: Gao Xingsheng (高杏生), a resident of Gaoxiang Alley in Lengshuiwan near the Sitouzhen in the sixth district of Wuxi (Tianxia City), works at the Yongyuansheng Rice Store in Beitang and has accumulated some savings. Unexpectedly, at around 12:00 AM the night before last, about twenty robbers speaking in a strong northern accent, with faces painted black and wearing short clothes, carrying weapons, broke open the gate and rushed in. At that time, everyone in the Gao family was asleep. After entering the house, the robbers tied up Gao's second son, Shixu (士旭), and his wife and daughter-in-law with ropes. Then, they arbitrarily searched Gao's bedroom and his two sons' bedrooms, emptying them. Even the newly made wedding clothes of the second daughter were looted. During the robbery, Shixu was slashed in the head with a mulberry-leaf-cutting knife and burned on both feet. Afterward, Gao Xingsheng checked the losses and estimated that he had been robbed of more than forty yuan in cash, four gold rings, three bracelets, and leather and cotton-padded clothing, totaling approximately two thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Bandits Send Threatening Letter Demanding One Thousand Yuan: Zou Suichu (鄒遂初), the head of Xin'an Town in the thirteenth district, has some assets. In early April, he and his wife, Mrs. Ma, went to Tianzhu in Hangzhou to burn incense, entrusting all household affairs to his son, Fukang (福康) (Note: Fukang is currently the captain of the Xin'an Merchant Corps). At 9:00 PM the day before yesterday, a stranger in his forties came carrying a bundle of rice straw and wearing a white cloth on his head, muttering to himself. The town's merchant corps, seeing his suspicious behavior, immediately drove him out of the town. After the man left, a member of the corps, Zou, suddenly found a threatening letter in front of the Tongmao Hotel on South Street. The letter was addressed to "Town Head Zou Zaichu (鄒在初)." Zou Fukang, the captain of the corps, opened the letter and read that it stated that the writer’s army has been organized for twelve years and has never requested military pay from the town head. They are now requesting one thousand yuan in cash from the town head. The writer indicates that within the shortest amount of time, their army will send someone to the town to receive the money and that failure to comply will be regretted. After reading the letter, Captain Zou ordered the corps members to strengthen security in order to maintain public order.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Arrest of Wanted Bandits: The county government of Changshu received a tip that the wanted bandit Hu Chaojiang (胡潮江) and others, who have repeatedly committed robbery and kidnapping in the county, were recently in the territory of Nantong County.

However, the bandits had already heard the news and fled. Later, they learned that the bandits were in Zhangzhishan, thirty-five miles from the city. The informant went with them to identify the bandits, who were then arrested. They then took a car to Mieshenggang, boarded the Zhenyu warship again, and returned to Hupu. After a brief interrogation by Shao, Hu cunningly denied any bandit activity. However, three business cards, a lined shirt, a white voile shirt, and a small rattan basket were found on Hu's body. Because the matter concerned bandits, Shao sent him to the county judiciary for interrogation on the morning of the eighteenth.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Finance Department Urges Payment of Old Arrears of Grain and Reed Taxes: The Jiangsu Finance Department stated that the arrears of grain and reed taxes from various counties in the sixteenth and seventeenth years of the Republic are extremely large. Previously, due to the province’s extremely depleted treasury, the provincial government held a meeting to strictly investigate and squeeze out funds to cover the budget deficit for the second half of this year. An order was issued to separately record the amount of debt owed by the people and the government, set a deadline for the shortest possible time this year, and order the collection and remittance of the taxes in batches. However, since then, the collection results have not been reported by various county bureaus. Therefore, yesterday, a strict order was issued to the finance bureaus and tax reduction bureaus of various counties and county heads to collect the previously owed taxes and remit them as special funds by a specific date to meet urgent needs, and to strictly investigate and squeeze out the remaining funds for successive delivery to the treasury. The funds must be cleared by the deadline.</p>

When the fire started, Wang was unaware. Li Laosan (李老三), who lived across the alley, saw the smoke and flames while urinating and ran to knock on the door and call out to the neighbors, who then gathered and beat gongs to call the small dragons to put out the fire. However, the northeast wind was strong, and it was difficult to extinguish the fire for a while. The fire was completely extinguished at 9:00 AM.</p>

The work has been completed. According to the department committee, this joint survey by the three agencies is to determine the most comprehensive reorganization plan for the entire Yangtze River water conservancy and transportation. Currently, it is believed that the collapse of Langshan into the river will make it more difficult to reorganize the Yangtze River waterway. No matter what, we must compete with the water for land and prevent further collapse. The proposed plan will be submitted to the department for approval. As for the Nantong retaining project, it should continue to be carried out to both maintain the land and prevent further changes in the waterway.</p>

(2) The heads of the security teams will also serve as anti-banditry committee members and will liaise with the committee members sent by the provincial bureaus at any time to discuss anti-banditry matters. (3) During the anti-banditry period, military and police officers at all levels should inspect the diligence and laziness of their subordinates at any time and strictly define rewards and punishments.

This time, he returned to his hometown to sweep the tomb, and he was robbed only two days after his return, which is a great misfortune.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>Reorganization of the Red Spear Society in Western Anhui: The bandits in Liu'an County, western Anhui, have been rampant in recent years, and the people have been ravaged for a long time. Kidnapping and extortion occur from time to time. Although the national army has been fighting hard, they are only targeting large groups of bandits, and they have no time to deal with the scattered bandits. The county's Baos have organized the Red Spear Society to protect their homes, but they feel that the name is impure and they lack training. The county government, seeing this, ordered the Shen Dong of each Bao to uniformly change the original Red Spear Society to the Communist Eradication Corps.

<h3>Chinese Wins Western Charity Football Match: Result 2 to 1</h3>
<p>Chen Zhenhe and Dai Linjing Each Score a Goal</p>
<p>-Ticket Revenue Approximately 5,555 Yuan, 1 Jiao and 1 Fen-</p>
<p>The highly anticipated Sino-Western Charity Football Match was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Chinese Baseball Field. Although this match was named charity, it was actually a competition between the Chinese and Western teams to determine which team was stronger. The Chinese team, the champion of the International Football Tournament, and the Sino-Western Captives team, the leader of the Western football clubs, stood shoulder to shoulder in Shanghai. The local community urgently hoped to resolve the competition in one night to determine the honor of being the overlord of the sea. Therefore, they met on the field of sand for charity, relying on art to determine the winner. After ninety minutes, countless changes occurred, and the Chinese team was pleasantly surprised to win 2 to 1. The end of the football season was like a grand event, and it was a value that we appreciated and a sweet aftertaste. I will record it as follows:</p>
<h3>(1) Thousands of People Contribute to Charity</h3>
<p>There are as many football fans at sea as river carp, and neither wind nor rain can stop them, nor can money hold them back. They only seek pleasure. Once they see famous Chinese and Western generals playing together in a once-in-a-lifetime match, especially because they are sacrificing their heroic qualities for charity, it can arouse the spirit of the world for the public among football fans. Thousands of people were present, and there were no empty seats. The two yuan tickets sold 149, the one yuan tickets sold 1,162, and the six jiao tickets sold 7,961, totaling approximately 5,520 yuan, 1 jiao, and 1 fen. After the closing ceremony, Shen Siliang, the honorary leader of the Association, patted the football, which was purchased by the Englishman Malison for 35 yuan. The total revenue was approximately 5,555 yuan, 1 jiao, and 1 fen, all of which were used to help the Shanghai United Youth Society Children's Clinic and the Women's Education Institute.</p>

<h3>(2) Inscription of Heroic Names in Lingyan Pavilion</h3>
<p>The Chinese victory is due to everyone's contribution, regardless of inside or outside. It is difficult to distinguish between thick and thin. In terms of goalkeeping, Zhou Xianyan is unparalleled in Shanghai. He saved many dangerous balls in the second half. Feng Yunyou's internal defense has no false moves, rejecting people thousands of miles away. Guan Xun'an, the assistant, is calm and composed in the face of danger, and the enemy cannot show their strengths. Those who attempt to capture the base rely on Feng and Guan. Li Ning, the central defender, has outstanding skills and stands out from the crowd. He is not second to Sun Sijing. He is allowed to be a substitute for Zhuang Shihong. A capable person is omnipotent. He was injured halfway, almost shaking the line of defense. Chen Jiaqiu, the right winger, is a masterpiece of a master, which is truly extraordinary. Wei Jinsheng, the famous left winger at sea, has the sigh of "Since there is Yu, why is there Liang?" Liang Shutang, the left winger, has a family background and is a natural talent. His horizontal diving save of Falansi was his most proud work of the day. Dai Linjing, the center forward and captain, is imposing in all directions. His foot is both strong and skillful. The Jiangnan first shooter's 12-yard kick was just right. Chen Hongguang, the left inside, is physically strong and technically amazing. He is worthy of being a good newcomer. Xi Qiaosheng, the right inside, did his best. Chen Zhenhe replaced him as the left winger in the second half and was alive and well. Chen Zhenhe, the left winger, is the bravest of the three armies and has the strength to exhaust tens of thousands of people. He creates waves wherever he goes, and the author fears him like a tiger. He was later transferred to the central defense, which was even more to his liking, showing his great talent. Mei Hongbao, the right winger, is small and lively. He is a line foot who sees the strength in the cross. Lu Zhongen, the left inside, used what he did not learn, but he had a good work. The audience was amazed and suspected that there was divine help. The Western Captives team's skills were scattered, and they were weak everywhere on this day. The best performances of the whole team were by the central defender Ga Xu and the goalkeeper Bo Laite. The rest were mediocre.</p>
<h3>(3) A Top Header Breaks Through the Dragon Gate</h3>
<p>The referee Le Xiurong blew the whistle to declare the war. Mike Nottden, the director-general of the工部局, was invited to the event to perform the smell ball ceremony. The left inside Tou Na initially tried his foot, but he kicked it diagonally out of the goal. The ball's momentum reversed and tended to the left wing. Chen Zhenhe tried to pick up the ball several times, but he did not succeed. At thirteen minutes, the center forward Falansi绕绕绕 out of the formation and went deep alone. Suddenly, Liang Shutang came across the field and saved the ball with a diving kick. Three minutes later, the Chinese momentum suddenly increased. The black-faced general Chen Zhenhe bravely showed his power and initially created a corner kick. The kick was excellent, and the ball went to the right. Liang Shutang returned to the center, and the ball went to the left again. Chen Jiaqiu greeted the left side, and Chen Zhenhe jumped and headed the ball into the net. The whistle, applause, and cheers sounded at the same time, wishing the Chinese team success. Li Ning took on the central defense position and was excellent. At thirty minutes, he was injured and withdrew, and his energy was greatly reduced and was subjected to pressure. Ten minutes later, he came to the stage again, and the Chinese spirit was boosted, and he continued to pursue the attack. Soon, Li's injury recurred, and the central line was weak, so the Western Captives team took the opportunity to counterattack, and for a time, its energy was overwhelming. As a result, they kicked two corner kicks in a row but ultimately failed. The Chinese team won the first half 1 to 0.</p>
<h3>(4) A Twelve-Yard Ball Determines the Victory</h3>
<p>After changing formations and fighting again, Li Ning withdrew shortly after the war. Chen Zhenhe was changed to the central defense, Xi replaced Chen's position, Lu Zhongen came out to play the left inside, and Chen Hongguang was transferred to the right inside. Lu Zhongen has been silent for a long time, but at this time, he showed his face greatly, which was very strange. The five forwards at that time were able to take turns to knock on the door for a long time without stopping because of the thickness of the central defense line. Under the tense situation, the Western Captives team also sent out foreign troops to try to seize land and claim hegemony. However, things went against their wishes. Xi Qiaosheng's troops came to the left formation and fought hard with the enemy. Center Forward Dai went to help and挑挑 the ball. The three generals Chen and Mei were伏伏 in front of the door. The ball came and rushed to pounce. The goalkeeper won the first victory and the storm calmed down. But the Chinese alarm bells were ringing in succession. Zhou Xianyan showed his superb skills, succeeded from under the iron hooves or from within the encirclement, came to the ball out and turned bad luck into good fortune. At that time, the center forward of the Western Captives team, Falansi, shot a ball fiercely within five steps, but Zhou blocked it. Before Falansi could shoot again, his arm touched the ball, and the referee was right behind him, so it was difficult to know the truth. Unexpectedly, this ball hit the vital point and became a wrong case. After the score was 1 to 1, the Chinese team made even greater efforts. Chen Hongguang retreated unsupported and defeated. Many people took part in the melee that followed. Western Captive Shi Gaosuo's arm touched the ball and he was penalized 12 yards. Center Forward Dai hit the ball with one kick and got the score 2-1.</p>

<p>Competition Personnel: A total of 256 people registered and joined, and 195 people arrived for the roll call and departure. Zhou Yuyu, a long-distance running champion, also did not arrive. As a result, Ma Fengrui and 14 other people won the top 15 places. In addition to Ma and the other 15 people, 118 people finished the race within one hour. Among them, Le Kangnian was only over ten years old, and although his ranking was behind, he also finished two laps, which was commendable.</p>
<p>Order Along the Way: A fire truck from the Fire Brigade led the way in front of the contestants, followed by a car filming newsreels. The Public Security Bureau dispatched eight machine guns and bicycle-powered bicycles to travel in front of the contestants to clear the way and disperse pedestrians, and also to protect the contestants. There were also ambulances following behind. Special police officers were added to maintain order on the 3rd route and round route. In addition, the East Asia Sports School male and female scouts were also on site to take care of things, so everything was orderly.</p>
<p>Spectator Spectacle: Even before the race, the Fangbang Bridge area was already crowded with tens of thousands of people. The police dispersed them and then they came back together. They had to step up their efforts and push them back. Machine gun cars ran several times before the race could begin. The spectators standing on both sides of the road cheered constantly. From Ximen south back to the original place, there was no land and no people surrounding it like a bucket. There were also those who watched from high-rise buildings and those who looked down from the car top. Men and women, old and young, were probably over 100,000 people. The traffic was cut off for more than an hour.</p>
<h3>Competition</h3>
<p>At the start, the two hundred competitors were lined up. The fire engine moved first, followed by the machine gun vehicle. At the sound of the starter's command, the entire group surged forward, each one bravely striving to be in the lead. In the front row were Peng Shuxin, Wang Shidi, and others, with Ma Fengrui also among them. Peng took the lead with quick steps, but after running several hundred paces, Zhou Ruquan stretched himself and caught up.</p>
<p>With a leap, Zhou Ruquan took the lead, reaching Xiaoximen first, followed by Ma Fengrui. Peng had fallen behind. Next were Chen Xingpei and Long Zexian, second.</p>
<p>In this order, they passed Dainanmen and Xiaonanmen. Gradually, changes began to occur. Ma Fengrui leaped into the lead, passing Xiaodongmen. Chen Xingpei closely followed, only two feet behind Ma. Three or four yards further back were Long Zexian and Zhou Ruquan, with Zhou Ruquan another four or five yards behind.</p>
<p>Like a flying arrow, Ma advanced. Already in the lead, he moved faster and faster. Although Chen Xingpei bravely chased after him, he gradually felt exhausted. Returning to the pagoda for the first lap, Ma was already twenty or thirty yards ahead of Chen. Ma flew forward, getting further and further away. Passing Xiaoximen and Xiaodongmen again, Ma was already far in the lead, Chen lagging forty or fifty yards behind. Another fifty or sixty yards back were Zhou Ruquan, Xu Yanbo, and Long Zexian, advancing side by side, with the rest following behind.</p>
<p>Applause thundered. When Ma reached Xiaobeimen, the champion was determined. It was impossible for the others to catch up. Applause thundered along the way as the crowd welcomed him. The road was almost blocked. Ma jumped over the machine gun vehicle, increased his pace, and sprinted towards the final dash, winning the championship with a time of thirty-seven minutes, thirty-five and four-fifths seconds, setting a record for the first session. Chen Xingpei arrived six or seventy yards behind, taking second place. As a result of the competition between Zhou, Xu, and Long, Long came third, Xu fourth, and Zhou Ruquan fifth, with very little distance between them. It was said that Long's performance was diminished because he had just recovered from a recent illness.</p>

<h3>Awards Ceremony</h3>
<p>The awards ceremony was held at the Republican Theater. The meeting and ceremony were conducted as usual. The Secretary-General, Xu Peihuang, and the Director of the Bureau of Education, then stood up to report on the proceedings.</p>
<p>Xu Peihuang reported on the proceedings. The Secretary-General, Director Xu, said that this long-distance race was in accordance with the Central Government's promotion of sports and was an unprecedented event in the city, arousing public interest in sports. The enthusiasm of the audience was also unprecedented. The course was 11,000 meters long and two hundred people registered. He thanked the various bureaus and parties for their help. Mayor Zhang Yuejun gave a speech, stating that he had specially rushed back from Beijing to attend the grand ceremony. He then described the importance of sports in modern society, recalling that in ancient times, people were rich in the spirit of sports because their environment was fierce and they had to resist and struggle in order to survive, so they must have strong bodies and work hard in sports. Therefore, most of them were long-lived and strong. However, with the evolution of society, humans have gradually moved away from harsh environments, becoming comfortable and happy, without the need to struggle, neglecting sports and gradually becoming sick men. The National Government's promotion of sports is to restore the national spirit. Today's long-distance race is to guide the citizens of Shanghai to pay attention to sports, and so on.</p>

<p>Wang Xiaolai, a guest speaker and honorary advisor and chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, gave a speech, saying that today's event has attracted the attention of people all over the road, which is gratifying. This race has two important meanings: (1) China's commerce and industry are backward and should follow this race to catch up. (2) The Municipal Bureau of Education has designated the Third and Fourth Roads as racetracks, and China should also choose one road for racing. Everything requires training and interest, and although it is laborious, it can ultimately achieve the goal. Today's champion is Mr. Ma, and we look forward to him, with profound and far-reaching words, and the whole place applauds.</p>
<p>Shen Siliang, the chief referee, reported on the results. Shen Siliang said that today's spirit is very good, and there is something even more to report: among the players, there is Le Kangnian, who is only ten years old, numbered 104. When he finished the race, there were still more than twenty people behind him who had not yet arrived. He had prepared a special prize to reward him. Then he reported on the rankings and results.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang's wife presented the awards last. Mayor Zhang's wife presented the awards and the meeting was adjourned. The prizes were exceptionally rich. From the first to the fifteenth place, the Bureau of Education awarded each a silver shield, and Mayor Zhang awarded three silver cups to the first to third place. Commander Xiong awarded two silver shields to the fourth and fifth places, and another one to the fifteen-year-old boy Le Kangnian. Chen, the director of the Public Security Bureau, awarded a silver cup to the fifth place, and Guo, the director of the arsenal, and the Bureau of Finance and the Bureau of Social Affairs also awarded silver cups and silver shields. The Commercial Press, China Bookstore, Dadong Bookstore, and others each awarded books. This newspaper awarded a banner to the first place. In total, there were six silver cups, twenty-three silver shields, five banners, books, and countless other supplies. From the sixteenth to the one hundred and thirty-third place, each was awarded a commemorative plaque.</p>
<p>The special prize for the little hero. Athlete number 104, Le Kangnian, is only sixteen years old and lives on Fuyou Road in the South City. He is a student at Wushi Commercial School and is the youngest of the two hundred participants. However, after running two laps, he was still full of courage, with more than twenty people behind him. The conference specially proposed that Commander Xiong award a large silver shield, engraved with "Perseverance Leads to Success," and the whole place admired and admired him. After the awards, the conference was adjourned immediately.</p>
<h3>Contributing to the Grand Event</h3>
<p>The first long-distance race in the city was a great success yesterday, and the results were also satisfactory. The enthusiasm of the promoters is commendable, and the efforts of those who enthusiastically assisted yesterday should not be forgotten. Chen Xizeng, the director of the Public Security Bureau, personally directed and took care of everything with exceptional enthusiasm. All the officers and police of the Public Security Bureau did their best to maintain order in an orderly manner. The gentlemen of the Health Bureau and the Fire Brigade worked hard to clear the way and provide first aid. Shen Siliang, Xu Zhendong, Rong Qizhao, Wang Fudan, Ling Xitao, and Qian Yiqin served as referees, enabling the conference to proceed smoothly. There are also many other supporters who cannot be listed one by one.</p>

<h3>Second Day of the Annual Meeting of the China Children's Education Society</h3>
<p>The meeting continued from 9:00 AM on April 19th, with more than 200 members attending. The chairman, Ma Ke, invited Sakamoto, the Dean of Academic Affairs of the Dobun Shoin College of Japan, to give a lecture on "The General Situation of Elementary Education in Japan."</p>
<h3>Sakamoto Lectures on the General Situation of Elementary Education in Japan</h3>
<p>First, Chen Heqin introduced Mr. Sakamoto, saying that he was a classmate of his in the United States and has been working at Dobun Shoin in Shanghai for eleven years. He is very familiar with Chinese education. Then, Sakamoto lectured in English, translated by Mr. Chen, briefly saying that when he was in the United States, he remembered that the Japanese students in New York had very close friendship with the Chinese students. After he returned to his country, he came to China to work and has many Chinese friends, so he is not only a Japanese citizen but also an international member. Speaking of elementary education in Japan, it can be said that it imitated China twenty-six or seven years ago. This kind of education is very similar to the old-fashioned education of your country in the 19th century. He also received old Chinese education during the Qing Dynasty. Japan also learned Chinese books at this time, thinking that reading ancient texts could increase personality and make gentlemen, which was the same as the thinking in China at that time. But now Japanese education is completely different. New education was produced in 1887, compulsory education was popularized in 1891, and education fees increased to 18.01 million yuan in 1903. The education regulations promulgated in 1891 had a great impact on current education. All moral training for children in Japan in recent years is based on this. In 1900, the Elementary School Education Ordinance was promulgated. Before 1900, ordinary elementary schools and higher elementary schools in Japan adopted a 4-4 system. After the promulgation of the 1900 Ordinance, it was changed to a 6-2 system, which meant to increase the compulsory education period. Regarding the curriculum, the first focus is on self-cultivation, followed by national language, arithmetic, history, geography, science, drawing, crafts, and gymnastics. Girls' schools add sewing. Higher elementary schools have more agriculture, industry, commerce, and vocational specialty courses than ordinary elementary schools, and the rest is basically the same. The salary of Japanese teachers is 95 yuan for principals, up to 180 yuan for class teachers, and at least 45 yuan. Subject teachers are paid up to 160 yuan and at least 35 yuan. There is also a seniority-based salary increase method. After five years of service, there is an annual increase of 5 yuan. There are also differences in the treatment of male and female teachers. On average, male teachers in higher elementary male schools earn 74 yuan, female teachers 54 yuan, ordinary male teachers 72 yuan, and female teachers 50 yuan (to be continued).</p>
<h3>Visiting American Warships</h3>
<p>At 1:30 PM, all members gathered at the Jianghai Customs Wharf, led by Zhu Shaoping, who said that the officers of the American warship led them to board a small boat to Wusongkou to visit the American warship. The ship can accommodate more than 800 sailors. The members were divided into four groups, each led by an officer of the ship to visit various parts of the ship and give a brief explanation. It was not until 3:00 PM that they boarded the original boat and landed.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Weakness Last Week</h3>
<p>The shape was tortuous, and the fluctuations were still small. The gold price fluctuated slightly last week, continuing its weak and complex form. However, the waves were not turbulent, only fluctuating by more than ten taels per day around 710 taels. At the fourth cycle, the six-day spot price was still posted by the bulls at two to three taels, while the May price was traded in only three days. The lowest price at the beginning of the week was only 706.5 taels, and the highest price later in the market was 722 taels, a difference of 15.5 taels. As a result, it rose 7 taels compared to the previous weekend. The June opening was 720 taels, and the highest price was 24 taels. The lowest price was 03 taels on the next day (Thursday). During these three days, there was a cycle of 21 taels, resulting in a fall of 06 taels. Comparing the first day's opening, it fell by 13.5 taels. In general, the market recovered from firmness to fatigue, with quite a bit of divergence. Overseas silver markets and Shanghai bills of exchange saw increases. Large bars rose 375, and the silver price rose 750,000 taels first. The gold price fell 2.5 fen on one day. The trend in the bank's inner ship was also loosening. Chinese businessmen repeatedly threw out to exchange back the receipts. The major firms in the industry each had their own demands for supply. The bulls and bears restrained each other and became a confrontation. The Dalian gang, Tongtaichang, Chenfeng, Yongbing, Fuchang, Yuanheng, and others were all speculators on the long side, as was speculator Wu. The short side consisted of Yongheng, Xinhneg, Yuansheng (Luo), Lu, Guangbang Hengxingshengda, and others. As for the quoted prices, they were still being pressed to around 60 taels. The gold market is likely to have some changes in the future. The general situation of the week is recorded below:</p>
<p>From firm to weak, with hidden downstream pressure. On Monday, large bars rose 0.0625, US silver rose 0.25 shillings, and the listed price remained unchanged. The internal market seemed tight, and the May spot price closed up 4.5 taels at 713 taels. Because there were more buyers, although the silver market rose slightly, it was later sold off by major firms such as Chenfeng, Yongxin, Hengzhifeng, and Yong. The price was then removed to 06.5 taels. Subsequently, because the buyers were tireless, they immediately saw a setback. The afternoon Indian exchange rate shrank, and Wu chased up to 22 taels. The closing price was 21.5 taels, 13 taels higher than the previous day. There was a total of 15 taels and 5 qian in the market before and after. On the next day, the price of large bars and silver fell 0.0625, and US silver fell 0.25 shillings, unchanged. The internal market was flat. However, the hedging competition left 40 taels of light. The short sellers in the industry suffered a big loss. The gold market opened at 719 taels, down 2.5 taels. Because the silver price shrunk slightly, it did not move. Then, major firms bought in, rising to 21 taels and 8 qian. After entering, it softened again. The afternoon closing price was 16.5 taels, sold by Xinhheng, Yuanmao, Yong, etc., down 5 taels from the previous day. There were only 5 taels and 3 qian of ups and downs throughout the day. There were not many transactions because the spot price was approaching. On Wednesday, the London silver market rose 0.125, and the US silver rose 0.25 shillings as before. The internal market was easing, and Fuchang and others were selling. The spot price opened down 6.5 taels at 710 taels, then from 12.5 taels to 08.5 taels, then hovering around 710 taels. In the afternoon, Chenfeng Yongda Xingyong and others competed to buy because of Wu Chen's receipts, so the closing price was 18.3 taels, up 1.8 taels from the previous day. The difference for the whole day was 9.8 taels. The numbers had privately opened the spot price in the afternoon. Yingfeng Heng Yao initially posted more than a thousand receipts as 2.5 taels to 2 taels. Then the numbers all exchanged the price, calculated as 2 taels to 2.3 qian. On the next day (Thursday), the official opening was 2 taels, and then it was made over 3 taels. There were no more May transactions, with the opening price being 17.8 qian and the closing price being 15.5 taels, down 2.8 qian from the previous day. The June opening ship was 20 taels, then 18.5, and then it rose to 24 taels. Dalian gang and Yuancheng bought in. Large bars rose slightly 0.0625, silver price unchanged. Now, the internal market was flat. Later, large households such as Wu Chenlu sold a lot of long positions, so the price was getting worse and worse. Later, the market suddenly became 11.5 taels, and the closing price was 12.7 taels, down about 8 taels from May. There were also 12.5 taels of difference throughout the day. On Friday, large bars rose 0.25, silver price rose 0.5 fen, so the shilling did not move for many days. Suddenly it rose by one grade. The internal market was also loosening, and there were many sellers, so the spot price opened down 9.7 qian, calculated as 03 taels. Afterwards, the big households fell and entered, and then broke out of 10 taels. The afternoon high was 15.8 taels, and the closing price was 14.9 taels, up 2.2 qian from the previous day. There was also 12.8 qian of back wish. On the weekend, the large bars were slightly smaller 0.0625, the silver price remained unchanged, the shilling remained unchanged, and the internal market seemed loose. The spot price opened down 3.4 qian, calculated as 11.5 taels, and then 05.5 qian. Later, Wu et al. added to the noon, which was 13 taels. After 11:30, the situation suddenly changed for the worse. The sellers were many and the shillings were also hard, so the closing price was 06 taels, a total reduction of 8 taels qian. During the day, there were 7 taels of ups and downs. The high and low prices of the British, American, Indian silver markets, and bill prices are described below:</p>

<h3>Sunday Loan Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday and banks were closed as usual. The financial market was calmer than usual. Although the money market was open as usual, it was not as prosperous as usual. The foreign interest rate in the early market was 7 qian 2 fen 8 li 2 hao 5, and the interest rate in the afternoon market was 7 qian 2 fen 8 li. As a result, it was 3 hao 7 smaller than the previous day. The interest rate in the early and afternoon markets was 2 fen, which was better than the white loan market the previous day. The money houses received and remitted more than 4.9 million in foreign public bills, and more than 37 million in silver public bills.

<h3>Long-Term Loan Notes</h3>
<p>Today (the 20th), there were a small number of long-term loans due, about one or two million, of which most were transferred, and some were recovered and newly made, so the procedures for handling were more complicated than usual. But it is not as good as the two big closing periods on the 15th and 30th. News from the outside world is rarely seen. Yesterday, it was even more sparse. Only a small number of mixed currencies were traded on this street, roughly a few thousand or one or two million. However, the interest rates are all above 10 taels. As for long-term deposits, they are currently being negotiated, either by transfer or new delivery. However, the interest rates must listen to the internal market, so they are not calculated at present. It is rumored that the pawnshop gang has set the interest rate at 8 taels 7 qian 5 and 8 taels 5, but it has not been confirmed whether it is true, and the amount is also unknown. The Ningbo bank's loan water passengers will need to come to Shanghai within the day.</p>

There was no major change in the environment. The large households still have no large amount of access. The trend is generally peaceful. However, the market demand is quite active.

<h3>A Week's Gloomy View of the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market has shown weakness in the past week. In addition to the weakness, the three grades of cotton yarn in the downstream market were particularly weak after the short squeeze. About 45,000 bales of various cotton yarns have been imported into Shanghai, causing a stir among the people. Furthermore, the spinning mills in Japan may increase production. As a result, the price this month has dropped from 145 yuan to 132 yuan. The situation of American cotton is also sluggish, with many retail investors scrambling to sell short, resulting in an extremely scattered market. However, major players and a certain large merchant are holding tight and not loosening their grip. Due to the adverse surrounding environment, it is difficult to support the market alone. Most people believe that the market will gradually decline in the future. In addition, the sluggishness of 10-count coarse yarn has emboldened traders to aggressively short the market. As the exchange rate has slightly loosened, the market has become even softer. However, the current sales of spot yarn are still quite good. The appetite for goods in South China and North China is relatively healthy, and the inland areas of Sichuan are also not bad. At the beginning, the spot sales of standard yarn were still good, and both buyers and sellers were holding their ground, with fluctuations of only one or two taels. Later, due to the weakness of the three grades of yarn and American cotton, and the decline in gold prices, the price in each month fell by two taels and five or six mace compared to the previous week. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 85,950 bales of cotton yarn. Various guilds purchased a total of 10,045 bales of spot cotton yarn, and fellow traders purchased 2,400 bales. The price of Japanese yarn is very firm, but the export trade of 42-count fine yarn is still smooth due to the shortage of goods. The selling price has increased by three or four taels compared to the previous week. The price of the three grades of yarn in Osaka has fallen by twelve yuan in a week. The breakdown of the purchase volume by each guild is as follows:</p>
<p>Guild	Bale Amount	Guild	Bale Amount	Guild	Bale Amount</p>
<p>Guangdong	14,500	Sichuan	1,610	Inland	2,150</p>
<p>Hankou	300	Shantou	580	Jiangxi	510</p>
<p>Tianjin	860	Wuhu	150	Xuzhou	155</p>
<p>Yunnan	100	Qinhuangdao	200	Gaoyang	230</p>
<p>Niuzhuang	1,000	Nanyang	125	Luzhou	150</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Guilds	500	Fellow Traders	2,400</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Ended Weak Last Week</h3>
<p>The cotton market had a downward trend last week. Due to the very few spot cotton transactions, the demand from various factories was scarce. The global cotton industry also showed weakness, and people's confidence was very low. Later, as the price of American cotton hovered around one corner, the situation was still stable. The price of standard cotton fluctuated between 42.2 and 42.3 taels. At the weekend, with the fall in gold prices, the price of standard cotton fell further by 700 or 10 taels. American cotton also weakened, and people were panicked. The price in each month suddenly fell by six or seven mace. However, Japanese merchants still held tight and did not loosen their grip. Most people were hedging, speculating that the reason for their actions was that the inventory of goods in various regions was exhausted and the source of supply was lacking, so they were still in a bullish position. It is still impossible to predict the future. At the beginning of the week, the price of standard cotton remained stable, but it fell at the weekend. As a result, the price in each month fell by five or six mace compared to the previous week. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 197,700 dan. The purchases by factories only included 1,600 pieces of Shaanxi cotton. There were no other transactions. The sources of supply included 1,500 bales of Yao cotton, 1,021 pieces of wooden frame cotton, and 564 bales of Tong cotton. The situation of American cotton was similar to that of the previous week.</p>
<p>Factory Purchases	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Transaction Volume	Term</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton	43.50	41.25	1,600 Pieces	Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<h3>American Cotton Has Short Covering</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to short covering in American cotton, spot merchants bought in and sellers were scarce. The market was calm and firm. The futures price rose by 11 to 14 points. The spot price rose by 15 points. The futures price of British cotton fell by 1 point, and the spot price rose by 4 points. The spot price of Egyptian cotton remained unchanged. The market for Indian cotton was firm, with the near-term and far-term prices of Pingguo, Olmura, and Bairo Guanxi all rising by 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 18th).</p>
<p>American Cotton Compared to Previous Day	Heshigui	British Cotton Compared to Previous Day	Heshigui</p>
<p>51029	Up 1	244.10	5546	Down 1	47.30</p>

<p>Bairoxi 196	Up 3	38.80</p>
<h3>The Grain and Rice Market is Hovering</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 20 rice boats came to the port from Zhabei, and the sales were uneven. The price of North Japonica rice has tended to hover. The sales of medium and inferior Japonica rice are quite active, while the ordinary high-quality Japonica rice feels flat. The particularly top-quality Japonica rice is stable. The intentions of buyers and sellers in the market throughout the day are different, resulting in price differences of one jiao. Although the sales of thin Indica rice are not very brisk, the market is still flat. The price of Yangxian and Duxian rice shows a tendency to increase, which is secondary. The appetite for goods from various parties varies in terms of briskness, but the overall market is very firm. The sales of white Yuan cargo are still acceptable, but buyers are very strict on price, so the price is mediocre.</p>
<p>Yesterday in the South of Shanghai, about 20 guilds arrived. The sales on this street have improved. The price of machine-milled white Japonica rice from various stores has unanimously increased by one jiao, but the transactions are not very active. The early-season Indica rice from the South is popular and the price is stable. People's confidence feels slightly active, and the market situation is showing signs of strength. The arrival and sales of Yang Du Jian are evenly matched, and the market sentiment is slightly firm. The price of Yuan cargo is scarce and the market is stable. The appetite is hanging, and it is difficult to start, so the price is barely maintained at the original level.</p>
<h3>The Tung Oil Market in Hongjiang is in Season</h3>
<p>Tung oil from Hongjiang is exclusively for domestic sales. The best sales seasons are spring and summer. The oil pressed by various workshops in the producing area in the winter of the previous year can be transported to the market in February and March of the following year, which is considered new oil. Therefore, those who operate this business also take this opportunity to prepare goods. Due to the excessive inventory last winter, several companies wanted to sell the old oil, so they stopped pressing for a year to sell off the old oil to avoid unclear inventory. All the new goods this year have arrived one after another. The genuine brands are Jichang and Jiyingfeng, which have arrived in several batches. However, the old oil has been sold out for a long time, and the new oil is snapped up as soon as it arrives. Moreover, the number of genuine brands is small, resulting in many who want to buy but cannot. The new oil of secondary brands has also arrived. This year's oil is no different from last year's, so the market does not distinguish between new and old oil. There are also Xiang Taifeng and Ji Ying, which are secondary brands, but the output is very small, the oil color is better, and the selling price is also higher than other secondary brands. The first batch of goods has already been sold, and the subsequent batches cannot arrive immediately, and there are not many, so they are quite popular. Although the prices of various secondary Hong oils vary, the situation is very stable. In general, the output last winter was not as large as the previous winter, and the new goods of various brands have not yet arrived, and the stock in this port is not strong, so the market is becoming more and more firm.</p>

<h3>Various Industries' Tax Rules Association Presents Opinions on Business Tax</h3>
<p>Provides Four Reasons</p>
<p>Please Select the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>The Tax Rules Research Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Industry Association presented its opinions to the Legislative Yuan yesterday because the Central Political Council resolved to entrust the Legislative Yuan with the task of formulating the Business Tax Law and the Executive Yuan instructed that all compulsory levies on the people by the central and local governments should first be decided in principle by the Political Council and then reviewed by the Legislative Yuan on its content. It said in the presentation: "We present this to express our humble opinions on business tax, and we respectfully request that you examine and adopt them." We humbly read the newspaper reports that the Central Political Council resolved to entrust the Legislative Yuan with the task of formulating the Business Tax Law, and we respectfully read the Executive Yuan's instructions that all compulsory levies on the people by the central and local governments should first be decided in principle by the Central Political Council and then reviewed by the Legislative Yuan on its content. This shows the central government's utmost consideration for merchants and people, and its seriousness in handling affairs. Before the content of the business tax in each province and city has been reviewed and approved by your court, there is no basis for opening the levy. Our association dares to humbly contribute our humble opinions at the beginning of your court's discussion, and we hope that you will examine them. (1) The method of taxation should adopt the principle of income. Business tax is one type of income tax. The most perfect business tax system in the world is undoubtedly the German business tax system. The collection of business tax is based on the combined amount of capital and business income. For example, if the amount of capital has reached a certain level, but the business income is less than a certain level for two consecutive years, the tax rate may be lowered by one level. This is to protect the operators of shops. The method of collecting business tax in our country, according to the provisions of the Outline promulgated by the Ministry, is divided into two types: capital amount and business turnover. However, the size of capital and the amount of business are not always directly proportional to pure income, which is not fair and balanced, and hinders the development of commerce, and the original meaning of business tax has also fundamentally disappeared. This should be taken into consideration by your court when drafting the Business Tax Law and reviewing the content of the business tax in each province and city. (2) Luxury businesses should be listed and restricted. Article 8 of the Supplementary Measures to the Outline promulgated by the Ministry stipulates that those who use business income as the basis for taxation should be handled in accordance with Article 4 of the Outline, and Article 4 of the Outline stipulates that the business tax rate should be calculated and collected using the per mille method based on the tax standard, and should not exceed 2 per mille at most, but luxury businesses and other businesses containing the nature of being cracked down on are not subject to this restriction. However, due to the provisions of this proviso in each province and city, it has become an unrestricted heavy levy. The original tax rate proposed by Jiangsu and Zhejiang even exceeded the maximum amount by more than ten times, and the Ministry of Finance's revision also exceeded it by more than twice. Most of the high-grade goods that exceed the highest tax rate are daily necessities or belong to the scope that should be promoted, which is contrary to the central government's original intention of tax reduction. It seems appropriate to clarify its nature and list restrictions so that each province and city cannot freely expand or contract, so as to avoid heavily burdening merchants and people. However, we dare to humbly contribute our humble opinions here. The so-called luxury businesses and those containing the nature of being cracked down on must be those whose business is purely for the entertainment of people's ears, eyes, body, and mind, and has no substance, or those who violate good customs and the government has explicitly restricted in administrative terms. This should be taken into consideration by your court when drafting the Business Tax Law and reviewing the content of the business tax in each province and city. (2) Chinese and foreign merchants should pay taxes equally. According to the collection of business tax in various countries, foreigners in the country must pay taxes equally. The French business tax regulations even stipulate that whether French or foreigners are engaged in commercial, industrial, or professional activities in France, they should pay business tax except for those who are explicitly exempted by law. Foreign merchants and factories in our country live in the hinterland, so there should also be explicit provisions for equal taxation, so as not to make Chinese merchants bear the burden alone and give foreign merchants the opportunity to invade. This should be taken into consideration by your court when drafting the Business Tax Law and reviewing the content of the business tax in each province and city. (4) Products exempt from lijin should still be exempt from tax. It is well known that lijin harms merchants and disturbs the people. The central government is determined to abolish it to save the merchants in Jiangsu. However, if cloth and lace embroidery and other categories were exempt from lijin under the harsh lijin regime, they should still be exempt from business tax after the reform to show support. This should be taken into consideration by your court when drafting the Business Tax Law and reviewing the content of the business tax in each province and city. Other items, such as the should be cut back on the regular customs within 50 miles, were originally approved for the elimination of the lijin council. It should be given attention when assessing the business taxes for each city or province. The collection of business tax should be based on business unit and only buying and not selling clients and traders that take care of the transporting and transfer should be exempt from the business tax. All these has been ordered by the finance ministry to obey, please order for these to be considered within the Business Tax Law, so that they may follow. Thus, the document of opinions has been presented to respectfully request judgement to be made and for selections to be made for the benefit of the peoples livelihood and to maintain commercial fairness, this is humbly presented to the National Government's Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Finance Bureau is Drafting a Business Tax Rate</h3>

<h3>Worsening Labor Strike in Customs Brokerage Industry</h3>
<p>No Hope for Peaceful Resolution</p>
<p>Workers Insist Cotton Yarn Transport is Unaffected</p>
<p>Since the customs brokerage workers in this city went on strike, imported goods such as cotton cloth and sundries have not resumed transportation. Cotton cloth merchants put forward conditions, requesting customs brokerage merchants to acknowledge them. Yesterday, the Customs Brokerage Association held a meeting and expressed opposition to the conditions, with no hope for reconciliation. The various situations are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>General Meeting of the Cotton Cloth Workers' Union: The Cotton Cloth Merchants' Association held a general meeting of representatives from various firms at 2 PM yesterday, with over 100 representatives from firms such as Chong Yu Chun Ji, Tong Feng Sheng, Gong Mao, Jin Feng, Hong De Yuan, Yuan Li, He Sheng, and Shun Yu Gong attending. Chairman Chen Songyuan reported on the progress of negotiations. Immediately afterwards, a discussion began. All representatives insisted that if the customs brokerage workers refuse to release the goods, the merchants will issue a declaration requesting public judgment. At the same time, they will petition the Social Affairs Bureau to request further mediation. A resolution was passed. General Meeting of the Customs Brokerage Workers' Union: The Customs Brokerage Workers' Union held a general meeting of representatives at 2 PM yesterday, with over 200 representatives, including Su Houxin, attending. Chairman Ren Xinxiong and recorder Yu Qishu reported that members dealing with cotton yarn and miscellaneous foreign goods insisted on joining the strike. After repeated persuasion by the chairman, emphasizing the disadvantages of not joining, all members eventually complied. (1) It was resolved that the inspection team will continue inspections from the 20th. (2) Strict investigations will be conducted on elements disrupting and privately soliciting customers to declare cotton cloth shipments. (3) A decision on the proposal to have cotton yarn and miscellaneous foreign goods join the strike will be temporarily postponed and submitted to the City Social Affairs Bureau for review. (4) Sun Dongsheng, Wang Wenzhong, Zhou Juxing, and six others were publicly elected as representatives to attend the Commercial Groups Association.</p>
<p>General Meeting of the Customs Brokerage Association: The Customs Brokerage Association held a general meeting of representatives from various guilds at 3 PM yesterday, with over 100 representatives from the North and South guilds, including Pan Mengyong, You Sening, Hu Ruifan, Ni Wenqing, Zheng Renye, and Zhou Jingzhai, attending. Representatives of the Customs Brokerage Workers' Union, including Ren Jinxiang and Su Yuanxin, and six others were present. After a long discussion chaired by Shi Zhikun, all representatives expressed that they could not accept the conditions of the cotton cloth merchants. You Sening then returned the conditions to the Cotton Cloth Merchants' Association.</p>
<h3>Silkworm Moth Workers Resume Work This Morning</h3>
<p>Three Resolutions Reached by Labor and Management</p>
<p>The silkworm moth workers in this city went on strike because the management violated the conditions. There was hope for resumption of work yesterday, but the union received a reply order too late to notify the workers, so they did not resume work. In the afternoon, workers at the Da Yang Bridge caused trouble. Labor and management negotiated on their own and reached three verbal resolutions. All workers agreed to resume work this morning. The various situations are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Notice of Resumption of Work: The City Social Affairs Bureau, after the silkworm moth industry's management representative, Zhu Zirong, acknowledged responsibility for fulfilling the conditions, immediately issued an order to the Silkworm Moth Workers' Union, stating: "The submitted case is noted. According to the statements of the management representatives such as Zhu Zirong, they have agreed to increase wages by one to two yuan in accordance with the contract. You are to inform them accordingly. However, the illegal strike by the workers in this industry is highly inappropriate. You are to comply and immediately instruct all workers to resume work uniformly from today. Anyone who dares to delay will be held responsible by the union's personnel."</p>
<p>Terms of Reconciliation: Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the responsible representative of the silkworm moth industry management, Zhu Zirong, and the executive director of the Silkworm Moth Workers' Union, Zhou Weixin, negotiated and verbally agreed on three resolutions for a peaceful resolution: (1) The management representative will be responsible for guiding each factory to fulfill the wage increase of one to two yuan per person. (2) After the management holds a meeting on the 25th to investigate when more than half of the silk factories in the city can open, the increase will be implemented from that month. (3) The Silkworm Moth Workers who were fired by each factory will have their reasons stated by the Union and submitted to the competent authorities for review.</p>
<p>Workers Cause Trouble: Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, a silkworm moth worker in the Feng Tai Yuan Silk Factory at Da Yang Bridge was working as usual, and a truck was moving goods out, which was seen by the striking workers. Believing that this was a violation of strike discipline, they immediately destroyed the truck and pushed it into the river. To maintain local law and order, the Da Yang Bridge police station immediately dispatched officers to intervene. The workers, misunderstanding the situation, crowded the entrance of the Fourth District General Office of the Public Security Bureau on Chang'an Road and refused to leave. Director Zhou ordered the police officer to persuade them to return, but to no avail. Director Zhou then personally persuaded the workers repeatedly. The workers finally agreed to leave and promised to resume work uniformly from tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Lawyers' Association</h3>
<p>77th Session</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association convened its 77th joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members at 10 AM yesterday (Sunday). Tan Yigong was publicly elected as chairman, and Dai Jixian recorded the proceedings. The proposals were recorded as follows: (1) Members Zhang Yaozeng and Shen Junru jointly submitted a request for interpretation of the legal ambiguity regarding whether the deposit money for tea porters on steamships can be given priority as a debt from the ship's property. It was resolved that it was necessary to submit a request for interpretation, and it should be forwarded to the Jiangsu Higher Court for prompt interpretation. (2) Members Gu Yongquan and Xuan Zhendong respectively requested clarification on whether a lawyer who does not concurrently serve as a district official can handle local cases in the Wuxi County Court. It was resolved to urge the central government to review the case and inform the original reporters to take note. (3) Anhui citizens Ouyang Kui and Wu Lanyi accused the President of the Anhui Higher Court, Zeng Youhao, of bending the law for personal gain and requested a righteous statement. It was resolved to forward the original text to the National Lawyers' Association for review. (4) The Hulin Silk Weaving Company reported that foreign merchants relied on extraterritorial jurisdiction as a shield, detaining managers and causing the company to cease operations, requesting that the Judicial Yuan and Executive Yuan be notified to instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to file a protest. It was resolved to submit the original letter to the Judicial Yuan, which would notify the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a serious protest, and to promptly recover the authority of the foreign courts. The original reporters were also informed to attend the meeting to investigate the detailed situation and hand it over to the Standing Committee for handling. (5) The tenants of Yixing Lane on Guoqing Road, Zeng Changchun, and others, complained that the First Precinct of the Fourth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau severed judicial power and interfered with civil rent arrears, requesting that justice be upheld. It was resolved to urge the Municipal Government, based on the original letter, to investigate and show the specific plans for ordering the Municipal Public Security Bureau to crack down on rent arrears and whether the limits of authority had been clearly defined. The Shanghai Local Court was also requested to investigate the original order of the Ministry of Judicial Administration to vigorously implement the preservation measures. (6) Committee member Cai Nipei reviewed and revised the suggestion to eliminate the restrictions imposed by the Ministry of Justice that lawyers are not allowed to wear uniforms or sit in court in civil mediation courts. It was resolved that the original draft should be revised by Committee member Cai and then discussed further. (7) Committee member Yu Zhongluo made a temporary motion that Article 5 of the Real Estate Land Registration Rules promulgated by the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau conflicts with current laws and regulations, and a discussion should be held on whether to propose a request for amendment. It was resolved to submit a request to the Judicial Yuan to forward it to the Executive Yuan to correct the errors in the bureau's registration. The Municipal Government was also requested to order the bureau to amend it, and Yu Zhongluo was elected to draft the proposal. (8) Committee member Lu Jianai made a temporary motion that the election deadline for the People's Assembly on the 21st of this month conflicts with the time for members to appear in court as agents, requesting discussion. It was resolved to elect the Standing Committee to contact the various courts to allow cases where the lawyer is absent on that day to be rescheduled. (9) Committee member Yu Zhongluo proposed that recently, court clerks often omit the reading procedure in the records, and the records are sloppy, which is quite detrimental to the parties in the lawsuit. A letter should be sent to the court requesting the rigorous implementation of the reading procedure. It was resolved to send letters to the various courts to pay attention to the rigorous implementation of the reading procedure, and to send letters to the members to request on-the-spot reading or viewing of the records to ensure accuracy. (10) The application of lawyers Lu Xingyuan, Sun Yuan, Lu Huimin, Wu Qinyan, Yu Zongde, Liu Bochang, Shen Yong, Ding Qi'wu, Geng Boyang, Chen Haishan, and Li Ming for membership was resolved. Except for Lu Xingyuan and Sun Yuan, who were asked to submit supporting documents for further approval at the next meeting, all other members were approved. (11) Committee member Lu Jianai proposed that since lawyer Lu Xingyuan had not completed the membership procedures, he had already published announcements about his practice. The lawyer should be notified to temporarily suspend the announcements. It was resolved to send a letter to the lawyer for verification. The meeting adjourned at 2 PM.</p>
<h3>Fishermen and Jellyfish Merchants Telegraph Request for Tax Exemption</h3>
<p>Jiangsu offshore island fishermen recently heard that the fish tax and fishery tax have been uniformly exempted, but jellyfish, cuttlefish, dried octopus, crabs, shrimps, and other seafood products of the same kind as fish have not been clearly indicated by the government, and the Customs still collects jellyfish tax as usual. Therefore, the fishermen repeatedly gathered at the Wusong Fishermen and Jellyfish Guild yesterday and publicly elected representatives to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to request an explanation in order to avoid disputes. The original telegram is recorded below: Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, Upon reading the newspaper, offshore island fishermen have learned that all fish taxes and fishery taxes have been uniformly exempted. We deeply appreciate the National Government's promotion of the fishing industry and its utmost care for the fishermen. From now on, hundreds of thousands of fishermen along our coast will have hope for development. We are grateful for the gracious policies and widely admire them. We believe that since the fish tax has been exempted, sea products such as jellyfish, cuttlefish, dried octopus, crabs, and shrimps are all types of fish. We are unsure if the tax rates for these are also exempted. As the jellyfish are being shipped to Shanghai and sold, the Customs still collects taxes, leaving the fishermen uncertain. Therefore, we are telegraphing to request a clear explanation for compliance and to avoid disputes. We are extremely grateful. Publicly elected representatives of Jiangsu offshore island fishermen, Lin Heyong of the Wusong Fishermen and Jellyfish Guild.</p>

<h3>Public Concession Uncovers Communist Party Organization</h3>
<p>And General Distribution Center for Propaganda</p>
<p>Twenty-Two Men and Women Captured</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the Public Concession police raided the Communist Party's general organization and propaganda distribution center between Friday night and Saturday morning. They seized 500,000 copies of propaganda pamphlets and leaflets, four printing presses, one paper cutter, one stapler, countless lead characters, one mimeograph machine, and other printing supplies. Nineteen men and three women were arrested. After interrogation at the Second Branch of the Higher Court on Saturday, they are currently under investigation by the police. Six locations in the Public Concession and three locations in the French Concession were searched this time. Due to the swift and thorough handling by Western Detective Luo Bingsheng, the Communist Party was unable to inform and evade capture, which is why so many were captured. Earlier, the police received a tip-off and searched No. 616, Zhengxing Lane (phonetic translation), North Henan Road, at 5 PM on Friday, seizing 500,000 books, leaflets, newspapers, and other items in the downstairs living room. No one was in the room. However, according to the tip-off, a person was arrested at a bathhouse at No. 260, North Henan Road and brought to Zhengxing Lane. Neighbors identified him as living in the house at No. 66. A bunch of keys was found on his person, which matched the locks of the house. The person confessed that the house was rented by a Mr. Wang in December of last year, but this person came several times and then never returned. Later, a woman involved in the case was raided at No. 298, Fuzhou Road, but she had already left. Nearby car rental companies said that a woman with a similar figure to that described by the detectives had hired a car to Zhabei and then got out and walked away in a remote location. In addition, a large number of propaganda items and a stapler were seized at No. 1638, North Jiangxi Road, which was probably a printing location. Two people and some communist propaganda items were arrested on Kangti Road in the French Concession. Subsequently, two locations were raided in the French Concession, and several people were arrested. Later, No. 21, Kaifeng Road, and No. 567, Guangdong Road, were raided. The house on Guangdong Road was also used as a printing location. When the detectives entered the room, several people were printing leaflets inciting workers at the arsenal to commemorate May 5 and overthrow the government together. There were also similar leaflets inciting railway workers, factory workers, students, soldiers, and arsenal workers in the room. Nine people were arrested on the spot. Later, at 10:10 PM, a person was arrested upstairs at No. 2942, Maohai Road, and a large number of communist propaganda items were seized, mostly wrapped and ready to be sent out. The contents were the same as those seized on North Henan Road. Although the nature of these propaganda items varied, the wording was extremely激烈, with some printed in English to spread to British and American soldiers. However, most of them were used to incite the ignorant masses and were mostly wrapped into bundles ready to be sent to other cities. It is believed that most of these propaganda items were issued before May 1 because the Communist Party planned to hold large-scale demonstrations throughout Shanghai on May Day. It is now believed that this plan will not be realized after the case is cracked. Among those arrested this time, one was an important figure in the Communist Party's so-called Jiangsu Provincial Soviet Government, who had been directing Communist Party activities in Shanghai for a long time. The documents seized also included the May 1st and May disturbances plan, as well as the declaration urging workers and soldiers to oppose the National Assembly, the Communist Party Jiangsu Provincial Committee's May 7th and May 9th declarations, and the May 4th memorial day declaration to students.</p>
<h3>Four Warships Enter Dock for Repairs</h3>
<p>Minquan, Su Zi, Jiankang, and Jiangkun</p>
<p>In recent years, naval vessels have made considerable efforts in patrol and bandit suppression, and the hulls of the ships are easily damaged. Therefore, the Jiangnan Shipyard is extremely busy with the repair of ships. It is learned that the shipyard dock saw four warships, including Minquan, Su Zi, Jiankang, and Jiangkun, simultaneously enter the Jiangnan Shipyard dock in Shanghai yesterday for repairs.</p>
<h3>Record of Contemporary Figures' Movements</h3>

<p>Song Ziwen left Beijing at 4:30 PM yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 11 PM.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Urban and Rural Telephone Service Begins Construction</h3>
<p>The Baoshan County urban and rural telephone service originally only had one pair of double lines, extending forty li from the county seat through Yanghang, Liuhang, and Guangfu to Jiading. However, due to the excessive number of telephones installed along the line, the power was limited, resulting in poor communication. The County Construction Bureau planned to add six lines to connect Luodian, Dachang, Yuepu, and Shengqiao, but due to Director Qian's transfer, construction could not begin immediately. After Wu Wenhua concurrently served as the Director of the Baoshan County Construction Bureau, he recognized the urgent need for telephones throughout the county and actively organized materials and prepared for construction. However, the previously planned single-line system was feared to cause difficulties in attracting electricity and clarity during future calls, so the main lines, such as Jiabao, Lucheng, Yangcheng, and Chuan, were replanned and converted to double-line systems to increase the transmission power. The plan has now been designed and is scheduled to begin construction on the 21st of this month (tomorrow), with an estimated completion time of one month. It is heard that the construction of the project is also planned to connect with the Shanghai Municipal Telephone service.</p>
<h3>Korean Guild Hosts Banquet for Zhang Weicheng</h3>
<p>Korean Overseas Chinese in Shanghai have a long-standing Korean Guild.</p>
<p>The Consul General in Korea, Zhang Weicheng, returned to Shanghai on official business this time. The guild specifically hosted a banquet at the Datong Restaurant at 6 PM the night before to welcome him. Those present included Zhang Weicheng and Korean representatives Cao Jingyu, Zhao Qianyi, Liu Zihong, and dozens of others. Halfway through the banquet, Cao Jingyu, on behalf of the guild, stood up to give a welcoming speech, and Zhang responded with a thank-you speech, discussing ways to restore the sales of Chinese goods to Korea to ten million yuan and proposing that the government reduce export taxes on Chinese goods. Wang Xingyi also reported that the National Goods Maintenance Association has decided to collect various samples of goods for display in Korea within a month to promote them, requesting Zhang's assistance. The discussion lasted a long time, and the guests and hosts parted happily at 10 PM.</p>
<h3>Acceptance Inspection of the Meipu River Project</h3>
<p>The Meipu River in Baoshan is more than ten li long and is one of the main rivers in the county. It has been three months since it was dredged. Now that the entire project has been completed, the concurrent Director of the Construction Bureau, Wu, believes that farmland water conservancy is crucial at the beginning of the spring plowing season. He immediately telegraphed the Construction Department requesting that they send someone for acceptance inspection as soon as possible to benefit agriculture. Director Sun immediately telegraphed County Chief Qiu to conduct the acceptance inspection together with the concurrent Director Wu and report it. Yesterday, Section Chief Xue of the second section of the county government went to the construction site for acceptance inspection together with Director Wu.</p>
<h3>General Meeting of Shareholders of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company</h3>
<p>Resolution to Add 2 Million Yuan in New Shares</p>
<p>The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company held its seventh general meeting of shareholders at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association at 2 PM yesterday. Shareholders representing 125,737 shares attended, and Mr. Wang Xianhua was publicly elected as chairman. After the formal proceedings, the chairman reported on the company's business situation last year, and the supervisors reported on the distribution of profits. It was resolved to add 2 million yuan in new shares and re-elect eleven directors and five supervisors in accordance with the regulations. Tea and refreshments were then served, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Record of the Emergency Meeting of the Cattle and Sheep Trade</h3>
<p>Request the Government to Stop Collecting Pig, Cattle, and Sheep Inspection Fees</p>
<p>The Cattle and Sheep Trade Association convened an emergency meeting of members at 2 PM the day before to discuss the Finance Bureau's order to pay supplementary fees for repeated and missed cattle and sheep inspection fees for 1919. More than 380 members attended, and Chen Guanghai was publicly elected as chairman. After the formal proceedings, the chairman first reported that due to the unresolved dispute over inspection fees in October of the 18th year, the former Chairman of the Commercial Reorganization Association, Yu Qiaqing, and the Municipal Government negotiated and telegraphed an annual quota of 22,000 yuan and an attached intent to purchase 10,000 yuan of Municipal Public Bonds as a mediation measure. The association was responsible for collecting fees from members based on the size of the cattle and sheep before and after slaughter and remitting the total amount to the Finance Bureau. Now, the Municipal Finance Bureau stated that the number of inspections calculated for the 19th year differs greatly from the total number of actual slaughters collected by the association from its members. The government now requires the association to pay the inspection fees for more than 31,000 heads exceeding one-tenth. As the case concerns the burden on the public, the members were convened to express their opinions on the inspection fees for the 19th year and decide on a specific plan to be presented at the next Finance Bureau meeting for research. Subsequently, You Zengfa and Chen Jiugao successively proposed that the National Government is now improving tax rules, abolishing harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies, and implementing the abolition of transit duties. It has also issued orders to all collection agencies in municipalities, provinces, and counties not to invent new items under any name, similar to transit duties, to harm merchants and disturb the people. Those that have already been implemented should be abolished immediately, and those that have not been implemented should not be created. The cattle and sheep landing transit duties that our trade previously paid were also exempted long ago. The purpose of the Municipal Government's establishment of this inspection fee was only to compensate the salaries of veterinarians employed by the Health Bureau and to compensate for all consumption expenses. It was not intended to levy taxes and increase the suffering of our cattle and sheep merchants. The opinions of the present members are that, in the face of a lack of sources and a declining commercial market, and with the new business tax in this municipality about to be implemented, we request that the government consider the difficulties of merchants and stop collecting this inspection fee. All salaries and expenses incurred by the Municipal Government for employing veterinarians for inspection can be equally distributed and borne by our cattle, sheep, and pig trades, without the need to count and collect fees on a per-head basis to avoid the suffering of being penalized at every turn. It was publicly resolved that this matter concerns the cattle, sheep, and pig trades and cannot be unilaterally decided by this association. On the one hand, we will send a letter to the pig trade to agree. On the other hand, we will submit a request to the Municipal Assembly for review. Next, Chairman Chen Guanghai said that the main point of today's meeting is to discuss the government's order for this association to pay supplementary inspection fees for more than one-tenth exceeding the standard in the 19th year, and we should publicly deliberate on this point first. Yao Changsheng claimed that after reviewing the meeting records of the Finance Bureau last year, the section on supplementary fees for more than one-tenth exceeding the standard was not mentioned. The results of the mediation by Chairman Yu of the Commercial Reorganization Association and the negotiations with the Municipal Government also did not have a record of the method of supplementary fees for more than one-tenth exceeding the standard. Moreover, this association collects fees based on the actual number of slaughters, and in fact, it has not received this extra inspection fee. If the members are ordered to trace the actual number of slaughters in the 19th year and apportion them accordingly, it will be impossible to cope with the decline in the commercial situation at this time. Yang Zhaosheng said that I have reviewed the records of the Finance Bureau meeting this time. The Health Bureau counted the total number of cattle as 80,686 heads, and the Finance Bureau counted 103,832 heads. The numbers counted by the two bureaus also differ greatly. Moreover, many omissions were made due to inspections without certificates. He requested that the government waive the supplementary payment for the 19th year. For the quota recognized this year, due to the export of Qingdao beef, cattle in the Lu and Wan areas were mostly collected. Due to the war, the supply of goods from Jiangbei is now scarce. He should request that the government consider the actual situation of the shortage of goods and appropriately reduce the quota recognized in the 20th year to maintain the difficulties of merchants. It was publicly resolved to propose this idea for discussion at the next Finance Bureau meeting.</p>
<h3>New Sassoon Sues Qingyun Lane Tenants</h3>
<p>Part of Eviction Transferred to Mediation</p>
<p>Plaintiff Appeals</p>
<p>The British merchant New Sassoon &amp; Co. previously filed a civil lawsuit with the Special District Local Court against tenants in Qingyun Lane for rent arrears and requested an order for eviction for demolition and construction. The case was accepted by Judge Zhou Daren of the Civil Division, and a judgment was made on the 31st of last month dismissing the part of the request for eviction and transferring it to the Mediation Court for conciliation. Yesterday, the court summoned both parties to begin mediation in the Ninth Court. According to the lawyer representing Sassoon &amp; Co., Hops, he disagreed with the first instance judgment and filed an appeal yesterday, disagreeing with the mediation of the eviction part. Judge He stated that since the plaintiff disagreed with the mediation, he had to declare the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Dancer Suddenly Dies</h3>
<p>At around 9 PM the night before, a dancer at the Datong Ballroom suddenly collapsed and lost consciousness while resting after dancing. He was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment but died.

<h3>Female Servant Crushed to Death by Collapsing Cart</h3>
<p>A woman from Dang Kou Village in Suzhou, named Deng Gu Shi, aged forty-four, was working as a domestic helper at the home of a certain person upstairs in the Southeast Restaurant on Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession for just over ten days. On the 17th of last month, at around 9:00 AM, she went out to buy vegetables with a basket. While she was paying for clover at the intersection of Caishi Street and Dongxinqiao Street, a horse-drawn cart suddenly collapsed. The streetcar crashed into the cart, and she happened to be standing nearby, causing her to be knocked down and injured in the waist and nose. The police arrived and took the injured person and cart to Renji Hospital, and brought the cart driver to the police station. However, Ms. Deng died of her injuries on the afternoon of the next day (the 18th). The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan sub-hall for an autopsy. Because yesterday happened to be Sunday, they are waiting for the tram company to report to the French Court today to send personnel to examine the body, and the deceased's relatives in Shanghai have urged Deng Debao, the undertaker, to come to Shanghai to collect the body.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over a Case of Forcing Someone into Concubinage</h3>
<p>The Original Plaintiffs and Defendants Mutually Accusing Each Other, Unsure How It Will End</p>
<p>Zhao Dechi (also known as Yellow Dog), from Zhenjiang, accompanied by a woman named Zhao Liu Shi (also known as Zhu Hua), posing as a married couple, hired a lawyer to sue Wang Ziyang, a resident of Ling Sheng Fang in Tongji Road, Zhabei, and a fellow townsman, in the local court, accusing him of obstructing freedom and forcing Zhao Liu Shi into concubinage, requesting that Wang be punished under Article 315, Section 2 of the criminal law. After being summoned, the defendant Wang Ziyang also hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to defend himself in court, arguing that Zhao Liu Shi was actually Wang Ziyang's concubine and had lived with him for many years. This time, she was actually instigated by her lover Zhao Dechi to abscond with items and dared to falsely present themselves as a married couple to file a lawsuit. Therefore, a counterclaim was filed, requesting that the plaintiffs be punished for false accusations and theft. After the interrogation, it was ordered that both parties be released on bail pending verification. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued trial. Judge Wu renewed the retrial and the defendant's lawyer, Shen Xingxia, stated that the defendant had already filed a lawsuit against the plaintiffs with the procuratorate of the court for joint theft. The procurator Zhao had already interrogated the plaintiff Zhao Dechi and taken him into custody at the detention center. The theft part of the counterclaim should be withdrawn. Judge Wu then ordered the court clerk to go to the detention center to briefly interrogate Zhao Dechi and instructed both parties to invite a matchmaker and witnesses to court for a retrial. Lawyer Shen stated that the last time the procuratorate opened a hearing, only Zhao Dechi and a related person, Jie Dengao, appeared. Zhao was sentenced to detention, but Zhao Liu Shi had not yet appeared. The judge then ordered the defendant Wang Ziyang to bring Zhao Liu Shi to report to the procuratorate. After another interrogation by Procurator Zhao, he ordered Zhao Liu Shi to be taken into custody for investigation. It is truly unknown how this mutual accusation lawsuit will end.</p>
<h3>A Flagpole Kills a Girl</h3>
<p>At No. 1110-1111 Yangshupu Road, a double-frontage Zhonghe Tang Pharmacy, which had just been newly built and moved in around June of last year, yesterday at around 4:00 PM, the flagpole was blown down by the wind and unfortunately crushed a fourteen-year-old girl, causing her brain to burst and severely injure her. The Chinese police car No. 386 took her to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but she died soon after.</p>
<h3>Another Burlap Sack Corpse Appears in the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a rescue bureau patrol boat recovered a corpse from the Suzhou Creek at Chedaijiao in Zhabei. The corpse was in a burlap sack, bound with lead wire. It was determined that the corpse was about twenty years old and had knife wounds on the neck. It was believed that the person was killed before being stuffed into a burlap sack and dumped into the river to destroy the body. The water patrol was immediately notified. However, a similar murdered corpse was also discovered in the river at the Xinzha Bridge the day before, causing considerable alarm. In addition to reporting to the Public Security Bureau for investigation, the local police were also ordered to report to the local court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Thieves Enter Baoshan and Leave with Full Hands</h3>
<p>Strict Orders for Investigation in Qiu County</p>
<p>Baoshan City is only about one li in circumference, with only a few hundred households. The Public Security Bureau usually conducts strict household registration checks, and the city gates are locked every night at 10:00 PM, so there are no theft cases. Unexpectedly, recently a large gang of flying thieves suddenly arrived outside the city. As soon as the night was deep and quiet, they flew over the city walls and stole from various places inside the city, resulting in repeated theft cases on all four sides of the city for several days. Those who were stolen from included the home of Wang Zuiyun, the director of the property office in front of the East Gate, the home of Song Meilang under the Kuixing Pavilion, the home of Chen Luqi in the South Gate, the home of a certain Xu in the West Gate, and the home of Bao Meixi, the director of the audit department of the Finance Bureau. Most of these families were wealthy and had high walls and tightly closed doors and windows, but the thieves came and went freely, overturning boxes and cabinets without a sound. Their skills were so high that it was alarming. The most strange thing was that there were two or three piles of human feces on the ground in each of the stolen homes, indicating the large number of thieves and their calm and unhurried manner when stealing. It is said that the losses suffered by each family were quite substantial. After Qiu Mingjiu, the magistrate of Baoshan County, received the reports of the loss lists from the victims, he was greatly angered and ordered the Public Security Section to quickly investigate and solve the case to reassure the people.</p>

<h3>Shanghai will have a 34-story building</h3>
<p>The foundation engineering strives for solidity</p>
<p>All internal materials are steel mesh</p>
<p>The buildings in Shanghai are headed by the Sassoon House on the Bund of Nanjing Road, and the highest of them is the 14-story French apartment building on Budan Road. It has recently been rumored that there will be a 24-story building in the center of the French Concession. It is now known that a well-known engineer in Shanghai has recently planned a 34-story building that exceeds all building records in the Far East. The construction site has been determined to be near the original site of a certain type of building near Jing'an Temple Road, Pike Road, in the Public Concession. The drawings have also been drafted. The major issues currently being considered are not the huge construction costs and the various ground works, but whether the ground can bear the heavy load and prevent the neighboring buildings and roads from being safely hindered during construction, or the sinking and tilting of the house after completion. According to the results of the general engineers' verification, the soil layer of the Shanghai base is relatively thick, with a depth of up to 80 feet before the stone layer can be seen, and the bonding of the soil layer is particularly loose. Therefore, the construction of a huge building must first lower the foundation engineering more than 80 feet underground to be safe. Especially in the direction of the racecourse, steel piles of great depth and length should be nailed within several feet around the giant building to avoid the influence of the giant building's heavy pressure on the one hand, and the unevenness of the soil mounds. The racecourse is a flat grass land without any weight to suppress, and Jing'an Temple Road is the most prosperous place for vehicles and horses, and the vibration is also great. It is especially felt that this expectation is not something to be scoffed at. As for the ground down to several feet, the entire base of the building must be completely cemented into blocks, such as the current major buildings. Since the construction of the giant building above the ground is as high as 34 stories, the height is about 500 feet or more, and the weight of brick, stone, iron and wood will inevitably be huge. The latest method of saving weight is currently being considered. In addition to deciding to use hollow bricks to build the outer frame of the house, where the internal walls are to be built with stone, steel mesh is used instead. The pillars, beams and other large materials that bear the weight are all made of hollow steel pipes. The internal fire protection, hygiene, elevators, and other equipment are all thorough and convenient. Once the plan is perfect, a follow-up visit will be made to determine the total cost of the entire house, which is currently being budgeted. If the plan is complete, the construction period will begin soon.</p>
<h3>Post Office Employees are Guilty of Private Trafficking in Opium</h3>
<p>Also using uniforms as a protective charm</p>
<p>Unintentionally revealing flaws</p>
<p>Sentenced to three years in prison</p>
<p>And fined three thousand yuan</p>
<p>A few days ago, it was reported in this newspaper that Hua Bu Lu Shikui of the Exchange Department of the Detective Agency colluded with a certain fireman of the Beijing-Shanghai train to privately traffic in opium and opium, which was personally investigated by Deputy Detective Bai. The general patrol was furious because thousands of Chinese detectives in the concession were all corrupt and illegal, so how could the opium ban be set up? The Labor Bureau's lawyer was informed and sued the Special Zone Local Court to severely punish the perpetrators in accordance with Article 6 and Article 15 of the Anti-Smoking Law. Wu Tingqi sentenced the prisoner to six years in prison and a fine of six thousand yuan. There was no single incident, and just three days later, it was discovered that a public official also relied on his uniform as a protective charm to openly traffic in opium. However, the person was not a police officer, but a postal employee named Yue Guochang from Wuxi, who had been working in the Post Office for six years. The director promoted him due to his diligence in his work and was now earning a salary of seventy yuan a month. Three years ago, he was transferred to manage mail on the Beijing-Shanghai train. From then on, he wore his uniform and shoulder badges between Beijing and Shanghai. Unexpectedly, he was blinded by profit and thought that trafficking in opium would be profitable. Moreover, he believed that his position was such that the military and police could not check him, so he colluded with accomplices in Beijing to transport opium. It was delivered one after another and has never been exposed until now. At 10:00 AM on the 17th of this month, the Beijing-Shanghai train arrived at the station and suddenly had an accident, which was not expected. At that time, Yue was carrying a suitcase in one hand and a bedding roll in the other and walked out of the platform. Suddenly, he met Luo Zhenguo, an investigator from the Post Office, and talked a few words. Yue was nervous and could not help but show it on his face. Luo guessed the situation and became suspicious. There was no intention to check him, but now he had to search him. He immediately ordered the suitcase to be opened for inspection. Yue knew that it was difficult to hide it and had to admit it and asked to go to the post office to open the box for inspection to avoid onlookers. Investigator Luo reluctantly agreed to his request and escorted him back to the bureau. According to the report, the chief investigator Tao Bingcheng ordered a detailed search immediately. Luo first opened the suitcase and then unpacked the bedding. There were two large bags of opium in the suitcase and one large bag of opium in the bedding, weighing a total of 288 taels. According to the current value, it should be worth more than 1,000 yuan. Yue was then detained and the Hongkou police station was notified to send a detective to take Yue and the opium back to the police station. The next morning, they were sent to the Special Zone Court. Judge Xiao Xiefen interrogated him. The police lawyer Li Zhishan appeared in court and stated that the defendant had confessed in the police station that the opium was entrusted to him by a friend surnamed Chen in Nanjing and that it was not just once. It was found that the defendant was a public official and dared to privately traffic in opium. He should be severely punished as a warning to others. Yue Guochang's confession was similar to what lawyer Li said, but he said that the Chen family said it was cake flour when they handed it over. Judge Xiao verified the confession and immediately sentenced Yue Guochang to three years in prison and fined him 3,000 yuan for helping to sell and possessing opium. If he was unable to pay the fine, he would be imprisoned for one day for every three yuan, but the imprisonment period should not exceed one year. The opium was confiscated. After the sentence was completed, the prisoner did not indicate an appeal and was taken by the police to the western prison for imprisonment. Both cases were committed by public officials and the circumstances were very similar. The only difference was the crime and punishment. Yue was only half of Lu's sentence, which could not be said to be Yue's luck.</p>
<h3>Smuggled Pirate Ship in Wusongkou</h3>
<p>Discovered by the Water Police</p>
<p>Pirate Ship Attempts to Escape</p>
<p>Mutual Attack for Several Minutes</p>
<p>The Result is Escaped</p>
<p>Captain Zhang of the Fourth District of Wusong Water Police, in view of the pirate ships mixed in</p>
<p>Inner river disturbed the shipping merchants, and immediately reported to the provincial government for the establishment of a ship flag inspection office. For several days in Songkou, the flag inspection of the ships entering and exiting the sand fishing boats was quite serious. At about 4:00 PM the day before, a water police inspection ship passed by a fishing boat anchored across the river from Paotai Bay and saw it, so it approached the fishing boat to check the flag. Suddenly, more than 20 people rushed out of the boat, knowing that the ship was from the water police. If Dong immediately rushed to hoist the sails and tried to escape. The water police knew that it was a pirate ship and fired a shot to order it to stop. The bandits on the fishing boat also returned fire and refused to arrest. Both sides attacked each other for a few minutes and saw a bandit hit by a bullet and falling in the cabin. However, the fishing boat was traveling rapidly and was finally escaped to Sanxia by the ship. Later, after the imported sand ship reported to the water patrol team, Captain Ding Xiaoping led the team on a patrol ship to help the water police patrol the pirate ship. The pirate ship had fled to the open sea and could not be found.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Bus Resumes Line One</h3>
<p>Starting May 1st</p>
<p>After the Shanghai South Public Bus Company lost 21 buses due to accidents a few days ago, there was a sudden shortage of vehicles, and the bus route between Zhonghua Road, Xiaodongmen, and Shiliupu Hujunying, which had relatively few passengers, was temporarily suspended. The company plans to resume traffic and has ordered ten new Ranaka cars from the local Weili Company. Now five of these vehicles have been manufactured and will be transported to the factory for application within a few days. It is now known that the company will resume the first route from May 1st after the new car has been manufactured, and it is also heard that the company's self-requested ticket inspectors and sellers will also resume work from that day.</p>
<h3>Fuan Insurance Company Sued Again</h3>
<p>Plaintiff is Xu Lianghao, Manager of Yongning</p>
<p>The Fuan Insurance Company of this port has been sued dozens of times in recent years for failing to pay insurance premiums. Now, Xu Lianghao, the manager of Yongning Insurance Company in Tianjin and Hankou, has hired lawyer Shen Yuesheng to file a lawsuit against Deng Zhongze, the general manager of Fuan, to claim compensation. In October of the fourteenth year, Deng entrusted Xu to be the manager of the Hankou branch of Fuan and signed a contract stating that for all water and fire insurance policies insured with Yongning Company, Yongning should allocate one-quarter of the insured amount to Fuan for insurance. In May of the sixteenth year, Tang Renhou Tang in Hankou insured a house fire insurance with Yongning for 39,000 taels of silver. Xu allocated one-quarter to Fuan in accordance with the contract, and the amount was 9,750 taels. Unexpectedly, in the winter of that year, the entire house was destroyed in a fire. The insured party ordered the guarantors to compensate the full amount. After negotiations between the two parties, the discount was slightly reduced and the compensation was calculated at 72.5%. Fuan should bear the compensation of 7,050 taels, which Xu paid in advance. Later, when he asked Fuan for the money, Fuan was being controlled by general insurance customers and could not pay the compensation. He repeatedly shirked and delayed Xu's request, so that Xu still did not receive a penny. He was deeply worried that the垫款 would be thrown into the void. Recently, he hired Lawyer Shen Yuesheng to file a lawsuit with the Special Zone Local Court, requesting compensation. The court opened the trial a few days ago. Lawyer Shen submitted all the evidence. Judge Zhou Daren summoned Deng Zhongze for questioning and ordered the sentence to be announced on the morning of the 22nd of this month.</p>
<h3>Opinions of the Rickshaw Guild on Adding Rickshaw Licenses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Rickshaw Trade Association believes that the Public Works Bureau is opening up 1,400 licenses for rickshaw pullers and coolies this time to match the 10,000 rickshaw licenses in the Chinese area with those in the Public Concession. However, they are concerned that, in terms of time and economy, it may not truly benefit the real rickshaw pullers and may instead cause disturbances. Therefore, they have specially petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters Executive Committee, stating that after the Public Works and Finance Bureaus announced the measures for increasing rickshaw licenses in the Chinese area on the 11th of this month, speculative rickshaw dealers and ignorant common people, misled by the past practice in the rickshaw industry where each increase in licenses was followed by a reduction, impulsively applied for several or even dozens of licenses in the hope of getting lucky. The association believes that it is not difficult to verify the facts. The association also pointed out that in the past, the number of rickshaws in Shanghai South decreased from 5,064 to 4,500, and in Zhabei from 3,572 to 2,900, even before the public buses were in operation. Now that the increase in licenses is intended for those who pull and own their own rickshaws, how to examine the qualifications of rickshaw owners and how to remedy the temporary economic difficulties of rickshaw pullers cannot be resolved in a short period. In the Shanghai Municipality, besides the 10,000 rickshaws in the Public Concession, there are 7,400 rickshaws in the Chinese area, excluding Wusong and Pudong. If the original number is still maintained by the rickshaw companies, then the 1,400 newly added licenses should be gradually filled by general shanty town residents, as an encouragement for production and without losing sight of the intention to help the poor. This would prevent the speculative tricks of rickshaw dealers and avoid future disputes among the industry. For the sake of municipal administration and commercial transportation, it is appropriate to submit this petition to your department, requesting that you forward it to the municipal government for detailed examination of the registered rickshaw owners, ensuring that the benefits are realized in practice and that both rickshaw companies and coolies are sincerely satisfied. This would greatly benefit the poor.</p>
<h3>Accomplices in Two Robbery Cases in Nanshi Arrested</h3>
<p>The Second District, First Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau recently arrested Wang Yaonan and Wang Yunxiang, two bandits who, in December of last year, gathered a crowd and robbed Yan Longxing Clothing Store at No. 15 Futian'an Road and the residence of Sun Heyun at No. 110 Wangyi Ma Lane in Nanshi.

Patrol Officer Qiang Yude, accompanied by a patrol leader, together with detectives from the Old Gate Police Station, arrested the bandit Zhang the day before yesterday and transferred him to the Special District Local Court. After questioning by Judge Zhou Ting, the facts were confirmed, and the bandit was handed over to Patrol Officer Qiang to be taken into custody for interrogation.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>A Word or Two</h3>
<p>— Man Yin</p>
<p>▲ There is no absolute beauty or absolute ugliness in the world; it all depends on each person's point of view.</p>
<p>▲ To cry when you want to cry, to laugh when you want to laugh – this is what everyone considers to be an uncouth bumpkin, but his heart is the most carefree.</p>
<p>▲ No matter how intelligent a man is, he is always foolish when he is first in love.</p>
<p>▲ Heaven is beneath hell.</p>
<p>▲ Eating three meals a day, defecating after eating, and sleeping when tired – everyone denies that this is life, but it is the real life.</p>
<p>▲ There used to be a saying, "Better to be a dog in times of peace than a person in times of chaos." Now it can be changed to "Better to be a dog in a rich man's house than a person in a poor man's house," because a rich man's dog rides in cars and wears clothes, which is much more carefree and comfortable than a poor man's child working and sweating blood.</p>
<p>▲ First love is like eating sugar cane upside down; being in love is like eating grapes; after being in love, it is like drinking bitter juice.</p>
<p>▲ You can't find a bit of fragrance in a dung heap; there is no good conscience in the heart of a bad person.</p>
<p>▲ It's okay to be "round" in dealing with people, but you must be "square" in handling affairs.</p>
<p>▲ When meetings are held, everyone's speeches are full of tears, indignation, and passion, but after the meeting, they are silent and forget everything. Chinese people's patriotism is only five minutes of enthusiasm.</p>
<h3>Request to Repair the Confucius Temple in Qufu</h3>
<p>— Xu Wancheng</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Weizhi, former president of Nanyang University and current president of Wuxi National Studies College, together with Xu Shaozhen, Wang Qingmu, Yu Fu, Ding Fubao, Qian Jibo, Qin Yuliu, Zhu Shuzi, Lu Zhongzhou, and 22 others, initiated a petition to the National Government to repair the Confucius Temple in Qufu. The language was earnest and eloquent, with thousands of words, briefly stating, "...During the Northwest unrest, the situation was chaotic, and bandits plundered Qi and Yu, leaving the people in despair and without a place to turn. Relying on the Chairman's authority and military strength, they quelled the chaos and rescued the people from fire and water. However, the rebel soldiers entrenched themselves and recklessly used artillery fire, causing widespread damage and destruction to Shandong, the birthplace of Chinese culture, the model for human relations, and the location of the ancestral tombs. Without the protection of the divine spirits, the rebels caused much destruction, collapsing beams and pillars, burning forests and shaking tombs. The sounds of bells and drums could not be heard, and the people had no direction. Those who still had life fled to the old ruins, sighing and weeping, without a place to perform sacrifices. We believe that the nation must have a foundation to stand on... The principles of morality and human relations originate from Confucius, and his surviving works are clear and evident... Therefore, we report the extent of the damage to the temples and tombs of Confucius and other sages in Qufu, earnestly requesting that funds be allocated and that the governor of the province be ordered to work with the descendants of Confucius to estimate the costs and carry out repairs, renewing the views and comforting the hopes of the people... to look up to the residence of the sage and connect the hearts of millions of people." The petition also listed in detail the extent of the damage to the Confucius Temple, the Confucius Forest, the Yanzi Temple, and the Yuansheng Temple, which was very thorough. It is said that the Civil Service Office of the National Government replied on April 2nd that the case had been submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a copy of the petition from Mr. Tang, who also provided detailed explanations. I am deeply grateful. After reading it carefully, I recorded the above to inform those who care about Confucius.</p>
<h3>Buffalo Ploughing Competition in Xugong Bridge, Kunshan</h3>
<p>— Yun Su</p>
<p>Xugong Bridge belongs to Kunshan County, about three miles from Anting in Jiading. When Jiangsu and Zhejiang were at war, Xugong Bridge happened to be at a key point in the war zone. Fortunately, Mr. Cai Huang, a former member of the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly, disregarded his own safety and, amid the barrage of artillery fire, contacted local strong men and organized a defense force. Cai Huang's contribution was the reason why Xugong Bridge was not reduced to ashes. After the war ended, the Shanghai Chinese Vocational Guidance Institute entrusted Cai Huang to designate the area as a new village and operate it for five or six years. The facilities in the village are already quite impressive. A buffalo ploughing competition was held by the new village management office the other day. I am recording this event to tell the true story.</p>
<p>The organization of the new village is entirely based on the plans of the Chinese Vocational Education and Guidance Institute. There is a new village school with 300 students. In terms of construction, there is a public lecture hall, a chicken farm, and a bee farm. In terms of entertainment, there is a music club and a drama club. In the buffalo ploughing competition, all 300 households in the village contributed one buffalo each, parading around the new village in a single file. A corner of the vacant land outside the village was designated as a place for hundreds of buffaloes to gather. Men, women, old, and young came to watch, and there was not an empty household. The new village office pre-hired ten referees to judge the quality of the buffaloes. The purpose of the competition was not to emphasize the body material and texture of the buffaloes but to judge the plumpness and cleanliness of the buffaloes. The referees believed that the material and texture could be purchased at a price by the wealthy, while the plumpness and cleanliness clearly depended on the usual feeding. The winner of the first prize was awarded a rice thresher, and other winners also received encouragement. The last-place winner was even awarded a hoe. When the event ended, everyone was happy and took their buffaloes home.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Vocational Education Society set up the new village in Xugong Bridge because Cai Huang was enthusiastic about public welfare and had someone to entrust the task to, and the villagers in the area all had preliminary self-governance knowledge. The new village strictly prohibits smoking and gambling, which is a set creed that no one dares to violate. The chickens in the chicken farm are purchased from eggs from outside, and the chicken coops are especially clean. The farming equipment is also selected from the latest models, and the grain seeds are collected from various provinces.</p>
<h3>Sparkling Stars</h3>
<p>— Dan Yan</p>
<p>Two months ago, Charlie Chaplin's "City Lights" was released in various parts of the United States, and its unprecedented success broke all box office records. However, this film only has music and no dialogue. At a time when sound films are popular, Chaplin uniquely turned the tide and achieved great success, which is truly commendable. From this, we can see that the art of performance is the key to the success of a film. Sound films are indeed an advancement in the film industry, but the position of silent films has not declined. Whether a film is popular or not depends on the art of its performance.</p>
<p>When it comes to performance among Western actresses, I love Mary Pickford's innocence, Pearl White's liveliness, Clara Bow's passion, Lillian Gish's sorrow, Greta Garbo's tranquility, Janet Gaynor's naturalness, Nancy Carroll's warmth, and Myrna Loy's splendor... Regardless of whether they are old or fading or just entering the scene, their indelible traces remain on the silver screen, captivating the general moviegoers.</p>
<p>In our country, on the corner of Shanghai, the stars are shining brightly, and many talents are emerging. Such extraordinary talents as Hu Die's gentleness, Xia Peizhen's vigor, and Xuan Jinglin's charm are already widely appreciated. However, there is also a star whose fame has already spread, but whose past films seem to have not fully demonstrated her abilities, and that is the handsome and refreshing Liang Saizhen. Ms. Liang is skilled in singing and dancing, and especially proficient in martial arts. She starred in many films in the past at the China Drama Company but did not achieve success. Now, she has been scouted by the star-studded Star Company to star in the film "Three Arrows of Love," and its success has made people look at her with new eyes, allowing Ms. Liang to leap to the ranks of the top stars in the country.</p>
<p>The art of performance values ​​naturalness and cannot be artificial, values ​​fluency and cannot be stilted, values ​​subtlety and cannot ignore details, values ​​kindness and cannot be confined to one corner. As evidenced by the major Western stars, those who can gather all the strengths and win the praise of the masses are not lucky. However, unexpectedly, Ms. Liang Saizhen's "Three Arrows of Love" film combines the four strengths of naturalness, fluency, subtlety, and kindness. Her extraordinary progress will surely add an excellent talent to the domestic film industry, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>At a time when sound films are popular, if we want to change our tastes and see "Three Arrows of Love," we will feel an unexpected stimulus and excitement. The art of performance in the film has reached the pinnacle, and the twists and turns of the plot and the magnificence of the background break through the past flatness and simplicity.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Ge Garden in Chaxi</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Chaxi (Nanxiang) is rich in famous gardens, such as Nanyuan, Guyiyuan, and Ge Family Garden. I have visited Nanyuan and Guyiyuan to enjoy their beauty. The other day, I paid respects to my ancestors' tombs in Xizhangjing and returned by car through the east market, taking a tour of the Ge Family Garden. Although the garden is privately owned and in disrepair, the moss-covered walls and painted walls still have an ancient charm. Turning right after entering the gate, I arrived at Xueying Pavilion, where I could taste tea and rest. Next to the pavilion, there were dozens or hundreds of plum trees. The owner of the garden took the line "In the cold, there are guests seeking spring, moving the snow shadows to the sunny window" from an ancient poem and used the two characters "Xueying" as the name of the pavilion. It is a pity that I arrived too late to see the colors of the plum blossoms. I also heard that the garden has many chrysanthemums, which are quite famous. I regret that I arrived too early and could not see the thousands of acres of fragrant flowers. I missed the chance to appreciate the late-blooming flowers that defy the frost. The pavilion is bright and spacious, and the ear room is also elegant, with Zhang Wu's ink paintings of flowers and plants. However, they are rough and lack refinement, and are close to vulgarity. They do not seem to be authentic works of Mr. Wu, so they are not worth a connoisseur's glance. Next to the eaves is a clump of bamboo, the trunk is purple and the stems and branches are also slightly red, but the sparse green leaves are no different from ordinary bamboo. Buddhists say that Guanyin lives in the purple bamboo forest. Seeing the purple bamboo here makes one feel that Mount Ling is not far away. Looking back, a peach tree by the pond is blooming, reflecting the purple bamboo from afar, making the spring colors more intense. Then, I climbed the hill, crossed the ridge, parted the grass, opened the path, and toured around for a week. I hurried to the train station to catch the train. The passengers in the market ticket office were very crowded, because it was the season for outings, and there were many tourists. When the train arrived in Zhenru, a newcomer to Shanghai asked someone if they had arrived in Shanghai. The station attendant replied that it was Zhenru. The person thought it was the correct place, so they carried their luggage and got off the train. When they realized their mistake and wanted to get back on the train, the train sped away and they could not get back on. Mistaking Zhenru for the correct place was originally a joke, but now it has become a reality. The passengers who heard this could not help but laugh. Before the laughter subsided, the lights of the buildings shone into the eyes. Shanghai had arrived.</p>
<h3>Tomb Epitaph of Lady Deng, Mother of Ge</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Binglin of Yuhang</p>
<p>The Late Lady was the eldest daughter of the Deng family, a prominent clan in Jiading. Her father, whose name is omitted, studied Confucianism and had a good reputation in the past, but he died without an heir in middle age. The Late Lady, still in her childhood, lived in Jiading, mourning and grieving excessively, observing mourning rites as an adult. She served her mother-in-law with utmost care and thoughtfulness, earning a reputation for filial piety that was well-known in the family. At the age of twenty-one, she married Mr. Ge of the same county, serving her parents-in-law and managing the household diligently. She was meticulous in her daily meals and morning and evening greetings, and did not avoid the trouble of making pickles and preparing drums. She treated her maids and servants with kindness and sincerity, and harmony and respect prevailed inside and outside the family. Her mother-in-law had a younger sister-in-law, Lady Ye, who was virtuous but widowed early and was known as a model of etiquette. She praised the Late Lady, saying that a prosperous family would surely have a wise woman. The Late Lady followed her words and was respectful in all matters. After Lady Ye passed away and was honored for upholding her chastity, the Late Lady performed the rituals of worship and mourning on the anniversary of her death, recounting her virtues throughout her life. She bore three sons, the eldest, Cunque, who died early, and then Cunyi and Cunshe. She also had two daughters, Cunhui and Cunxian. She nurtured and taught them without relying on others, and when they grew up, they each specialized in one skill. When they were lazy or careless, she would not scold them, but her expression would be serious, and they would stop when they knew they were wrong. This was because she emulated the virtue of the cuckoo and compared her merit to cutting the cloth. It was appropriate that they were respectful and filial without coercion. From her time as a maiden to her time as a wife, she never slacked off in her actions. She can be called a virtuous woman of the nation and a model for the world. In September of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, she fell ill and lingered on until November 11th, when she passed away at the age of sixty-six. She instructed that the funeral arrangements be simple and that only enough clothing to cover her body be prepared. She was buried in Jiangwan Cemetery. Cunyi and the others divined the auspicious location and then requested an epitaph. Her deportment was virtuous and pure, and her actions were based on humility and integrity. She consulted widely with the community, and there was no objection. Her sons sought her advice on many changing events, and her words were earnest and could not be fully recorded. Cunyu will write a separate brief for the family precepts, following the example of Ban Zhao's Seven Articles and with the ambition of Shishi's lament for the times. Combining these two qualities, the ancients found it difficult to find such a person, but it can be seen in the Late Lady. Thus, I compose this epigraph:</p>
<p>Her outstanding virtue was truly endowed by the cosmos,</p>
<p>Like the jade's purity and the pepper's fragrance.</p>
<p>From her days in the boudoir to her days as a wife,</p>
<p>She encountered difficulties but remained upright.</p>
<p>She was diligent in her morning meals and meticulous in her preparations.</p>
<p>She was a祥女 who came to marry and honored etiquette.</p>
<p>Harmony and kindness pervaded, and all were influenced by her.</p>
<p>She nurtured and taught her sons with righteousness,</p>
<p>And her kindness extended to the servants.</p>
<p>Her virtue was so great, how can we not mourn?</p>
<p>She is forever closed in the silent tomb,</p>
<p>But her surviving words will shine brightly and flow far,</p>
<p>Illuminating future generations, so that they may not forget.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes of India (29)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>The religion of sun worship is everywhere; it is common to see people facing east and worshiping in the morning, and gentlemen also do so. There are not as many women in the streets as in Myanmar, where you can only see women. Compared with Myanmar, the Burmese people are fresh, lively, and full of spring. Their clothes are gorgeous, and their jewelry is magnificent. In contrast, India is full of poverty, and old antiques with beards roam the streets. The status of women is low. The prevailing religious sentiment is world-weariness, and people do not seek to make a living through industry. Indian culture makes people sad, makes people grieve, and makes people detached from the world. It is a vast, ancient, and mysterious nation. One should study Taoism while residing in India, but one should be happy in Myanmar. Great is India; this is why Gandhi is a great hero.</p>
<p>The evening sermon was on the topic of yoga philosophy, given in Bengali. The secretary, Kark, invited me, but I could not understand the local language. However, there was something very strange about this meeting that we could not understand. The scale of this association is very large, with branches all over the world. In Shanghai, it is run by a woman named Dr. Besant on Carter Road, initially a mixed-religion association where all religions are studied. Now, a savior has been added, Mishaia in Western languages, which means savior. The savior's name is N. Krishnamurti, and he is the head of the entire association. I heard that he is an Indian in England, about thirty years old. He was elected as the savior when he was a young boy. People have not heard of any special qualities about him, so I don't know why he was publicly elected as the savior. There are extremely strange things in India that we cannot understand, but upon closer examination, they have their own reasons. This savior is also one of them. I believe that he must have supernatural powers. However, the association is full of doctors, so ordinary people cannot deceive them.</p>
<p>Professor Mahasay of the 15th History Department accompanied me to see his exhibition of the University of Burdwan's twenty years. The university has a library with many books, which he says is unmatched by other universities. The university was founded nearly two hundred years ago and has more than a thousand students. However, there are no Chinese books because Chinese culture has not been promoted abroad, and people have long forgotten it. Indians only know that the Buddha came to India from China, and that Faxian and Xuanzang came to India. There is a ridiculous matter. When I told Indians about Chinese culture, they were greatly surprised. They said that they only saw Chinese people in India as shoemakers, and they thought that Chinese people could only make shoes. They did not know that China still had civilization that could benefit India and the world. They had never dreamed of it, so they asked about the difficulty of learning Chinese characters. I said it was very easy; 3,000-4,000 Chinese characters are enough to use, and the characters have not changed. Books from 2,000 years ago can still be read without changes, unlike European characters from the 15th century, which are very different. Moreover, the grammar is simple. Three Chinese characters can be used to replace 3,000 European characters, such as the three characters "将" (jiang, will), "正" (zheng, currently), and "己" (ji, already). For example, to say "I will go home," "I am going home," and "I have already gone home," these three characters can replace 3,000-5,000 changes in Western verbs and nouns. Their clumsiness is extremely ridiculous compared to the ingenuity and simplicity of Chinese. The listeners were delighted. I also said that the famous British scholar H.G. Wells said that the languages that will be universally used when the world is unified are English and Chinese, which shows that Chinese is valuable and recognized by Western scholars. The cumbersome names of Indian people are not as convenient as Chinese. For 2,000 years, only one kind of script has been able to circulate within 20,000 miles in China. India still has 140 different languages and dozens of different newspaper scripts, while Europe is only about the same size as China, but it also has dozens of scripts and languages. How can it be compared to China's uniform script, which even extends to Japan? So, the university professors and others were willing to learn Chinese. One person gave me a name card, saying that he could write three or four Chinese characters and translated his name as Kashyapa. I smiled and accepted it. Intellectuals on the ship all deeply believed that China could help India, and India also hoped for China's help.</p>

<h3>Northern Journey Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Anping</p>
<p>11.  Beiping</p>
<p>This time, I stayed in Beiping for about twenty days, but I still felt detached from the so-called true Northern life. Because I didn't go out much due to the wind, I couldn't fully experience the natural charm and urban life of the North. Needless to say, I must admit this is the biggest regret. Asking me to specifically write some impressions of Beiping is really impossible. Let me talk about it bit by bit.</p>
<p>Beiping is, after all, an ancient capital, so naturally, it has its bustling places. Just take the Six Nations Hotel as an example; even the most grand hotels in Shanghai cannot compare to its grandeur. However, speaking of the entire city of Beiping, what does it resemble? I say the best analogy is that Beiping is like a shattered honeycomb.</p>
<p>Most of the houses in Beiping are dilapidated and decayed beyond repair. As the train brushes past the city, on both sides, near and far, are all earthen houses. Seeing this, one can't help but be surprised, thinking, "Is this Beiping?" The houses in the North are not very tall; most are single-story buildings, which makes them seem even more humble. However, although the houses in Beiping are humble, they have a different charm that makes people love Beiping. The front doors of most residential houses are always painted in a row with several colors, such as shiny gold, emerald green, blood red, raven black, or some light yellow. Naturally, even the most exquisite palaces are decorated with colors blended from the above-mentioned shades. The colors are so "fresh" that they make people feel a sense of awe upon seeing them. The houses in Beiping are very large, but when you actually enter the house, they are very delicate and compact, with some Japanese-style elements that make people feel comfortable living in them.</p>
<p>Since the capital was moved, Beiping has been constantly buzzing with the issue of "Prospering Beiping" and "How to Prosper Beiping." Now, houses in Beiping are really cheap. For as little as ten dollars a month, you can rent several rooms. And there are many princely mansions with very large gardens that can be sold for ten thousand or eight thousand [dollars], and the deal is done. There are many houses in Beiping now that are uninhabited and unwanted. As mentioned earlier, you can buy a large garden for ten thousand dollars, but if you want to renovate that garden properly, it would cost you a hundred thousand or eighty thousand [dollars]. Is it worth it? No.</p>
<p>The market in Beiping is truly bleak now. It is said that since the capital was moved, Tianjin can still maintain about 50% [of its economy], but Beiping is pitiful, only able to maintain about 20% or 30%. The number of unemployed people is especially high. Just take rickshaws as an example; they are shockingly cheap. Let me give you an example: from Xizhimen to Haidian Yanjing University is about fifteen li, which takes an average of more than an hour to pull. Such a long distance costs only twenty cents. Can you imagine? In Shanghai, it would cost at least five or six cents.</p>
<p>Speaking of rickshaws, I think there are no rickshaws elsewhere that are more elaborate than those in Beiping. Beiping's rickshaws are not as simple as those in Shanghai; they are actually more elaborate than those in Shanghai. It is really comfortable to sit in the rickshaw. When the wind is strong, another kind of cotton awning with a curtain can be raised, so you won't feel any wind sitting inside the awning. It is said that Beiping's rickshaws are not rented from companies like in Shanghai; most of them are the rickshaw puller's own property. Therefore, in Beiping, it seems that you need to raise some capital to become a rickshaw puller.</p>
<p>The trams in Beiping are really unbearable. They are so dirty and disorderly. Trams do not have first-class and third-class distinctions. Even the people riding the trams are not as orderly as third-class passengers in Shanghai. Most of them are soldiers and some non-intellectuals. The air in the car is foul enough to make you feel sick. The sun shines in the carriage, and the dust can be seen clearly, like countless small insects flying in the air.</p>
<p>The shop fronts in the North are different from those in Jiangnan. Usually, they are two bays wide, with a row of glass windows. Each bay has a door, and each door is hung with very heavy cotton door curtains. This is because the wind and sand are heavy in the North. If it were spring or summer, I think these door curtains would have to be taken down.</p>
<p>Speaking of the shops in Beiping, it is easy to remember the merchants in the North. I must say that the merchants with the worst tempers are those from Jiangsu and Zhejiang. For example, the larger stores in Shanghai are better, and the clerks are still polite. But the clerks in those small stores really lack any merchant ethics. If you don't run to their store, they can't do anything to you. But if you run to their store and ask them for a price, it's as if you have to make the deal. There are many stores in Shanghai where just the snobbish faces of the clerks, I believe, would scare away many customers. In the North, it's completely different. The friendliness of the shop clerks in the North is rarely seen. When you enter, whether you're doing a one-cent business or a several-hundred or thousand-dollar business, or don't want anything, most of them treat you with consistent friendliness, without any snobbish faces or airs that might make customers unhappy. If you like to sit for a while, they will immediately pour tea for you. If you like to ask anything or want to know anything, they will never find you troublesome and will always tell you everything very kindly. When you leave, they will escort you to the door, open the door for you, and bid you farewell with a very polite word and a full forty-five-degree bow.</p>
<p>People in the North are definitely not as cunning and frivolous as people in Jiangnan. They are straightforward, decisive, sincere, honest, and willing to take responsibility. I believe that if a person from Jiangnan goes to the North, they will naturally become loyal to friends and responsible for their work. Not all people are absolutely devoid of conscience. The honesty of the people in the North will move you, move you to the core.</p>
<p>I remember one time I was with a friend, Guan Jun, passing through Qianmen when we saw a row of camels walking on the road. Guan Jun said that the best symbol of the Northerners is the camel because it is docile, clumsy, and hardworking and carries heavy loads.</p>
<p>I think this is very true.</p>
<p>As for the weather, it is also different from Jiangnan. For example, now in Jiangnan, it is bright spring, but spring in Beiping comes later. Spring in Beiping usually doesn't come until April, but when it comes, it leaves quickly, like a very delicate young lady who is unwilling to stay longer.</p>
<p>The longest season in Beiping is winter, followed by summer. Autumn is the shortest. In Beiping, it is not necessary to have a fur robe. It is best to make a silk-cotton robe because silk-cotton is light and comfortable to wear. When going out, you can put on a fur coat, wrap a scarf, wear a fur hat, and put on fur gloves. This is enough to cope with the cold. Because almost every household in the North has a fire, if you wear a fur robe, you will find it too hot on the road or as soon as you arrive indoors. So, in the final analysis, it is best to wear a suit. If you wear Chinese clothing without a coat, you often have to wear a cotton robe with a fur coat on top.</p>
<p>I haven't spent a summer in Beiping. It is said that it gets extremely hot in Beiping in the summer and that you have to install a refrigerator in the house if you don't have a stove. Maybe this is an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The language of Beiping is firm and crisp, which makes it pleasant to hear. But truly authentic and genuine Beiping slang is pleasant to hear, but few really understand it. When I first started eating in Beiping, it was the most uncomfortable thing because I couldn't order food. I didn't understand any of the names of the dishes that the waiters said. The dishes I wanted to order were incomprehensible to the waiters. So, I could only walk blindly, stumbling along.</p>
<p>The raw materials for the meat dishes in Beiping are mostly beef, pork, chicken, duck, mutton, and eggs. Fish and shrimp are not very common. As for rice, it is usually noodles, but there is also rice, and there is also a type of thin rice porridge. I found it very interesting when I first started eating it as a southerner.</p>
<h3>Tissot Pattern Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>I happened to see an advertisement in the Shen Bao for an exhibition held by the Tissot Pattern Society. Feeling that pattern exhibitions are rarely seen in China, I felt that I must visit it. So, I immediately ran to the upper floor of the National Goods Department Store on Nanjing Road and saw more than a hundred patterns displayed in three rooms. One part was the work of the society's instructor, Wang Gang. Among all the works, the three-dimensional craft patterns were the most numerous and the most outstanding. For example, Zheng Yuebo and Li Xiansheng's lamps and smoking sets, Ji Chundan's clocks, and Cai Zhenhua's bookshelves all used new shapes and colors, skillfully constructed to fit the patterns of craft products of the new era. Li Yuxi and Zhong Huangyuan's porcelain coffee sets had clever forms and elegant colors. It is a pity that the Chinese porcelain industry still only has paintings of "Pure Heart Beauty," etc., failing to apply these interests. Cheng Shangjun's wall decorations, plates, and Ji Chundan and Zheng Yuebo's umbrellas, and Li Xiansheng's wallpaper patterns were all very novel in color. Zheng Ruliang's promotional advertisements promoting forests were quite able to exert the value of advertising patterns. Other works were also mostly excellent. In short, at a time when Chinese patterns are still in their infancy, it is naturally gratifying and admirable that people like the members of the Tissot Society are working so hard. However, observing the current situation in China, patterns are still patterns, and crafts are still crafts, failing to integrate with each other. We should think about how to gradually bring patterns and reality closer together, and we hope that the members of the Tissot Society will take on this responsibility.</p>
<h3>Red House Sketches (1)</h3>
<p>— Mo Zhi</p>
<p>I live alone in a boarding house near D University. Counting to this day, it has been a full three years. My life is very unstable. The fate of poverty and sorrow tightly surrounds me. Especially in the past two years, I have tasted the devastation of unexpected storms, which has naturally caused my youth to vanish like clouds and smoke and made my face more haggard than yellow flowers. Therefore, I feel the meaninglessness of life. But in the first period, I also traced back to the heroes and ambitious people of ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign. Not a single one—at least most of them—did not struggle out of hardship and difficulty. Life is originally without the slightest meaning, but if one can strive forward and grope from darkness to the end of the light, then one can also find true meaning in the extremely meaningless waves. This elusive illusion often appears in my mind to comfort myself. But according to my experience, I know that most of the things in the universe cannot merge with the ideals of human nature. So, I was like this in the past, and I am like this now. In these three years, I have not moved once, living alone in this small red building, without any fluctuations, simply because of the above-mentioned reason. Speaking of this, I feel another wave of indescribable hidden pain. My life experience is too desolate.</p>
<p>This red house may have a considerable predestined relationship with me. Although its appearance is still presentable, it has lost a sense of freshness due to its age. However, it is the most famous on ×× Road. As long as you mention this red house, almost everyone knows it. Even if you take a rickshaw and say, "Pull to the red house," he will never mistakenly pull you to the door of another red house. Therefore, this red house has become its exclusive name. I have been living here since three years ago when I was about to enter this university. Through the introduction of an old classmate, I moved here. Initially, it gave me a good impression, with a sense of "love at first sight." At the same time, my nature is very weak. I treat everyone kindly. Teachers love me, and friends love me. Perhaps it is for this reason that in dealing with the world, I also feel that this kind of mentality cannot cope with all the environments of the current society. The so-called weak person is "useless." My nature is like this, so I can only be "useless" forever. If speaking from the standpoint of "benevolence and righteousness," I have not failed the teachers and friends who love me. So, the landlord and the housemates who live in this house</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>all understand me and cooperate very well. In the three years of living here, there has never been an unexpected change or quarrel with people. This is also a page worth commemorating in my short life history.</p>
<p>Because of my poor economic situation, sometimes there is even a panic of "no food to eat." Although this has become the most common phenomenon among students, I have probably suffered the deepest unexpected hardships and rarely spent a relatively stable life. Either I am planning the future development of my career, or I am worrying about how to spend the recent and future difficult days. These float in my fluid mood and become a habit. How can I still be able to study or write steadily? Young people should originally develop upwards, and all difficulties and hardships should not be taken into account. Although the future is vague, if we continue to work hard and struggle, we will also get the appearance of light. However, under certain circumstances, it will also cause the heart of young people to tend to decline and move towards a passive path. In fact, things in the universe are so contradictory.</p>
<p>I have observed it in various situations in this red house, but it has produced a lot of touching and tearful events, at least in the history of life, there are many sad things worth commemorating here. Because of poverty, I often go hungry for a day or two, telling the tea room to tightly lock the door and alone, I become writing manuscripts, fantasizing or sleeping, or even feeling sad to the extreme and singing sad poems, involuntarily crying loudly. If someone sees me at this time, they will laugh, sympathize, and also say that my nerves have changed. I complain that I am not a poet, but the nature of a poet seems to be somewhat there, so how can a person like me who is not progressing be worthy of people's extra care? It is because I treat people with a sincere attitude and a warm heart that I can arouse the sympathy and assistance of teachers and friends. Even the tea room here can deeply understand my heart. He admires me, he encourages me, so that I can move forward and strive for a career. In the present, although there is no escaping the distinction of "status" between people, he encourages me with true feelings. People are not made of wood or stone, so I naturally sympathize with him. This tea room is very honest, about forty years old. Sometimes, if he serves the students a little carelessly, he will suffer words that are difficult to hear, like an elder scolding a junior. He feels that his "status" is like this, so he has to endure the hidden pain and do his duty. Because I am more kind to him, he comes to me to cry about his unspeakable grievances. Speaking of his life experience, there is a great sense of "past and present feelings." Looking back at myself, although the positions of the two of us are different, the encounters we have suffered are not different. I say, "Just submit a little." For this reason, the tea room praises me as the best resident in this red house.</p>
<p>The face of the so-called landlord in Shanghai is the most difficult to see, but his face, with a fake tiger mask, is specially used to be applied to poor young guests. If he is owed too much rent, then he is not polite at all and demands payment from you every day. In fact, these tenants, because they are poor and cannot pay monthly, are definitely not deliberately delaying. The landlord will not imagine the inevitable suffering of these young people in any way. Under certain circumstances, he also has to send a serious ultimatum to the tenants. If he meets a strong Cantonese youth tenant, he will not allow you to do this either, and the result is, of course, a quarrel. The so-called victory must be said to belong to the landlord's side, because owing rent is always an undeniable fact. I can be considered the longest-living tenant here. Speaking of owing money, I should probably be the first to be mentioned because the chains of economics are really too merciless to me, just locking it tightly so that it cannot turn around. In the last half-year, it has been relatively relaxed, and some of the accumulated rent has also been gradually paid back. However, this landlord has always been loyal, kind, and well-intentioned to me and rarely asked me to pay back the accumulated debt in the past. This makes me feel more uneasy. I feel a little sorry and don't know how to express my gratitude to him, but I can only deeply engrave it in my heart. He also knows that I am a relatively promising young man, and perhaps there is a little hope in my career in the future. Therefore, he deeply understands my poverty. At the same time, he often advises me in conversations that poverty is not a shame and that it doesn't matter if young people suffer some hardships, just don't degenerate. These honest words are not at all jarring, and I also deeply keep them in mind. It seems that a landlord who sympathizes with poor young people is rarely seen in Shanghai. At the very least, he expresses his utmost sympathy and understanding for me. How can I not be grateful to him?</p>
<p>It is said that this landlord works in the Shanghai X Foreign Firm and does not rely on the rent from this red house to maintain his daily life. Moreover, he is a person who has received higher education and has worked in a X X newspaper, so he can understand the young tenants. He is also in his thirties, so his depth of experience in the world is of course deeper than that of those of us who have not yet entered the world. Every Saturday, he always returns to this red house once. When he comes back, he always comes to my room for a long conversation, asking about my recent situation. If I am trapped in sorrow, he also uses a sincere heart to comfort me. He treats me like a younger brother and shows the friendship of a friend. Such a landlord is really not easy to find. Of course, I also repay him with a young and sincere heart. The tenants who don't get along with him resent him very much, and there are no fewer than a few who have lived here for half a year or a few months and moved elsewhere. Because of this, there are fewer and fewer tenants here. One reason why I have lived here for such a long time is that I am grateful for the landlord's sincere treatment of me, and the other reason is that I am actually prevented from moving by economic forces. I owe him too much rent. Sometimes I write some manuscripts to sell and get a considerable income, but because I owe too much, the limited income is always used to eat before the emptiness after, and I cannot make up for what was previously owed. That is to say, after the previous account is paid off, the back account piles up again. How can digging meat to mend sores help? In terms of my money, I have really not misused a single cent with my "conscience." Even drinking and playing are all paid for by friends. They know that I am poor and take care of me in all aspects, giving me a kind of invisible help. In my heart, I can only be grateful and worship them. Apart from that, I have no other ability to repay them. Under these circumstances, if I want to enjoy a new life, I have to wait for the iron tree to bloom, right? But my wishes are not very high, and I have no extravagant hopes for these things, nor do I force myself to ask for them. I still taste the bitter and plain taste myself. For these reasons, I have lived in this small red house for a long time.</p>
<h3>New Teams from the Chih Chih Society</h3>
<p>— Jian Feng</p>
<p>The Chih Chih basketball team is strong and skilled, and it has long been a household name. I don't need to say more. But these team members are all friendly and approachable, without the slightest arrogance, and are particularly enthusiastic about promoting basketball. This is what our classmates respect and accept. Therefore, basketball teams from the Chih Chih Society have sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain. Recently, two new basketball teams have been produced: one is a women's basketball team, and the other is the Le Yu team.</p>
<p>The female students of Chih Chih have never paid attention to sports. It can be said that there is no sports organization. Whenever there is a championship competition, the female students of Chih Chih always abstain. But it cannot be said that there are none who love sports. Speaking of Miss Qian, she is innocent and lively, very fond of sports, and especially loves to play basketball. She does not ask whether they are male classmates or children from the junior high school. During her spare time, she joins them and learns all kinds of shooting. But she always regrets not being able to show off her skills. She has been working hard to organize their basketball team, dividing them into Group A and Group B, and asking Xia Zeren and Kong Guangyi to share the coaching duties. It has been officially established for more than a month. Every morning, when the east is white, Miss Qian, with a silver flute in her mouth, blows a sound from the palace, awakening the sleepy ladies from their spring dreams. At this time, the enthusiastic coach has already arrived on the court to wait. The weak and vulnerable ladies have been transformed into battlefield warriors. One day, once they go to war, it is expected that they will hold the championship in their hands and breathe a sigh of relief for the female students of Chih Chih.</p>
<p>The most lovable is the Le Yu team. The members of this team are mostly junior high school students, all under the age of sixteen, with Yang Yun Qilin as the coach. Since its establishment, the practice period has been from 5:30 am to 6:30 am every day, without interruption once. Now that it has been established for a long time, the results are very promising. A friendly competition was recently held with the Qing Zhi team of our school. The shooting was accurate, the coordination was thorough, and the passing was rapid. It was truly beyond the reach of the tall and clumsy Qing Zhi team. The result of the war—a draw of 30 to 30. If they can continue to practice like this, they will definitely grow up and become a forest in the future and win glory for the country. I wish my dear little friends—to encourage each other.</p>
