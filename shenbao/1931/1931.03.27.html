<p>國際間之合作問題。欲其有成功之望者。今恐尙非其時也。試觀各國有救濟銀賤之舉。其説雖多。而至今不能一行。蓋金貴銀賤。而商業因之受其影響者。不止一國。而受其影響之國。雖欲救濟。爲有他國之關係。不欲獨任其難而爲之先發。然此猶得曰關係之多。情形甚爲複雜也。又如橡皮之限制問題。同利害而有關係者。祇英荷二國。然亦屢屢會議而不能一致。據路透電昨述橡皮業專裴格之言。謂荷屬五大公司反對之電。非即橡皮委員會破裂之謂。但五大公司如果反對荷政府之干涉。則此後合作將甚困難。而荷屬政府亦未必實施限制辦法也因之而紐約市上。橡皮價格大爲跌落。由此以觀。限制橡皮出産之舉。將與救濟銀賤。同一不能實行矣。</p>
<p>橡皮與銀。其結果如是。則凡國際間之經濟合作。關税聯盟以及裁减軍備等更大之事業。即屢經號召。迭次會議。其結果。勢必無成。即成亦仍爲有名無實之形式而已。蓋人心與合作。所趨尙異途也。</p>

<p>要求暫緩進行</p>
<p>純屬經濟不涉政治</p>
<p>法律研究在所不懼</p>
<p>德奥當局之表示</p>
<p>路透社二十五日柏林電　英大使任波爾代表英政府向德政府交涉、請將關税聯盟計劃此時暫緩進行、俾聯盟有考慮機會、德外長白魯寗答稱、德奥協定在日内瓦革約意義之内、未有國聯應討論此事之理由、德奥政府不長此項協定在法律方面之研究、但若從政治觀察點研究之、則德政府認爲不可容納、因此協定純屬經濟也、此項協定之談判、因須解决種種細則、非數月不能告成云、</p>
<p>路透社二十五日維也納電　奥外長答英使關於德奥協定之詰問、謂奥政府以爲此協定完全不出一九二二年日内瓦革約結構之範圍、故奥國不反對日内瓦草約簽字者從法律方面研究此協定、惟此協定係經濟性質、不能從政治立塲研究之云、</p>
<p>國民社二十五日柏林電　白魯寗總理在工商會議席上之演説、各報皆極重視、而政界與國會休息室中、亦皆引爲唯一談話之資料、僉謂總理對於德奥局部協定堅决之辯護、在全歐議論鼎沸、捷法東西二國謠諑紛紜之日、實足爲一服清凉劑、白魯寗一再聲明、德奥税約絶不影響兩國與第三國間之成約、亦不牴觸他國之利益、且自謂彼深信工商會議决不致發生誤解、他日經過公正嚴謹之審查後、必能澄清四週懷疑之空氣、而使鄰邦深信此約企圖與目的之純正、因該約之利益、固不限於德奥二國、實可普被於全歐也、白氏繼稱、德國因償付賠欵之故、迫於四週之環境、尤不能不有此種新税約、蓋德國若欲償付賠欵、必須將進口貨减少至最低限度、而使出口貨增加遠逾現在之數量、德國因賠欵關係、在商業上有要求特殊待遇之必要、再則國際關税休戰之失敗、其咎不在德國、而德國實不得不運用其自身創造力、以别尋發展之蹊徑也、且德國不計多數人民之痛苦、毅然担任歐戰賠欵之清償、德内閣在前此數月之中、亦歷盡艱苦、然新税旣無從徵收、而賠欵復不能稍缺、於是德國遂不得不與奥國締結税約、故新税約不過一種經濟上之協定、要之亦列强不允輕减賠欵之所致也云云、</p>
<p>路秀社二十五日倫敦電　下院今日開會時、質問德奥關税協定者頗多、外交次官戴爾頓答稱、政府並未與德國或奥國或德奥兩國談判關税聯盟問題、蓋任何此種步驟、將令英國財政政策大加變動也、匪特對於外國如是、而對於殖民地與印度亦將如是、關於德奥關税聯盟事、德大使及奥公使曾以消息供給英外交部、現方甚密切注視其法律上商業上政治上之形勢、至於所議之約、於英國商業上有何影響、今尙不能預料、此顯須視關税聯盟實行、則徵收他國入口品之税率以决定之、惟下院議員可以放心者、政府必用全力防杜使大不列顚之商業利益稍受損害也云云、</p>

<p>、二因檢騐領票繳費等等、手續繁多、須多用夥伴、三因貨候檢騐、常誤船期、受市價漲落之損失、四因各處檢騐局對國内運銷之貨、均不檢騐徵費、青市獨否、未免不公、故亦堅决反對、不達目的不止、</p>
<p>調解情形　土産商罷運後、黨政兩方要人親赴檢騐局與局長牟鈞德磋商調解辦法、該局已函覆市府、准於二十三日起、凡内銷之花生米及油、仍行報騐、暫免收費、靜候實業部核示辦理、但土産商態度仍極堅决、不肯報騐、又黨政當局調停時、該局曾表示未經檢騐、海關不准放行、尙須請示財部、土産商遂推舉代表赴海關、面見税務司、詢問究竟、税務司表示、關於運銷外洋商品、奉部令非有檢騐單不准出口、至内銷商品、苟檢騐局來函説明、本關即可放行、代表等又於昨日赴該局、面見矣局長、説明赴海關接洽之經過、請函海關放行、矣答此事係奉實業部命令執行、本人無此權力、不敢奉命、此一塲交涉、遂仍無結果、（三月二十五日）</p>

<p>▲求原諒是乞兒的藏身之所。我們應當清償我們的債務。</p>
<p>▲長的衣裝。似乎可使摩登的女郎稍露其莊重。然而不幸得很。長的衣裝却與廣告有一樣的用意。</p>
<p>▲一個人假使没有仇人。他的事業决不能進步。因爲仇人們能很爽直地指出你的短處。像一個理想中的良友一樣。</p>
<p>▲愛情對勇敢的人媚笑。對懦弱之夫冷笑。對一個狂徒大笑。</p>
<p>▲汽車之速率。雖比馬車爲快。然而當一對摩登田女同車郊外之遊時。偶而情不自禁。汽車却不及馬車之安全哩。</p>
<p>▲男子們可以老得不能跳舞。不能工作。不能游戲。然而一見美麗的女郎時。他也不禁會整頓衣冠。做出老當益壯的精神來。</p>
<p>▲一個男子的愛情。决不能因經騐而取得更多的知識。常見他們這一次戀愛失敗。第二次却重蹈覆轍。</p>
<p>▲有許多女子。一生不知怎樣的去選擇一個丈夫。及至老將就木。悔已晚矣。</p>
<p>▲新婚的男女。好像兩個新結識的小朋友一樣。非經過一次的爭鬥。他們决不能成爲相識。</p>

<p>樊山謝世未及旬日。袁寒雲又以捐館聞。感舊傷亡。情何能已。内兄周无住與寒雲有賓主之雅。予也以文會友。亦頻通尺素。於其生平。頗知一二。茲得噩耗。有不能已於言者。寒雲。諱克文。行二。字抱存。一作豹岑。别署龜庵。嘗得趙飛燕玉環。以宮闈粉澤之餘。引爲奇倖。乃鐫一印曰燕環。吟詠撰述鈐用之。所以志寳也。詩才兼開府參軍之長。宣南七子。寒雲爲魁。曩曾硃印寒雲詩存一册。由易實甫爲之校正。惜流傳不廣。今已絶版無餘留矣。偶作小品聯語。極字裏花飛。行間蝶舞之妙。梨園子弟。以及北里中人·時有獲其聯幅者。蓋寒雲名士風流。素有聲色之好也。寒雲亦能粉墨登塲。審頭刺湯。尤爲其生平傑作。昔居海上。凡演劇募欵爲地方公益者。往往嬲請之。寒雲當仁不讓。常以法曲傾靡四座焉。有烟霞癖一榻横陳。夜以當晝。短衣赤足。雖客至。無所拘。就榻瀏覽羣書。讀至得意處，輒搦管評批。能仰睡而於書眉作蠅頭楷。秀遒工整。爲從來書家所不及。海内求其法書者。户限爲穿。間或作畫。折枝花卉。寥寥數筆。而自饒馨逸。在意趣不在規範。洵非聰明人不辦。性疏懶。不屑冠蓋靴笏。某要人愛其才。招之赴浙。特闢精舍於明聖湖濱以居之。寒雲謂湖山之秀。不可孤負。一月爲期。盡我登臨之樂。以後自當供職效勞某要人不之强。詎意蠟屐兼旬。即潛返滬寓。及某要人親來敦促。徒興室邇人遐之感。其清狂有如此。貎與海鳴將軍略相似。某報故並刊二人之影。寒雲戎裝。海鳴儒服。更令人不辨誰是虎賁誰是中郎。一時傳爲佳話。賞鑒骨董。目光犀利。然自信力强。偶市贋品。雖有告發其底蘊者。不之聽。以爲妄言。再告之。則見嗔曰。如此贋品。能得其雙。固願重價以易取也。又喜摩挲古泉。前年爲其哲嗣伯崇訂婚。古泉一枚。以爲文定。其親家方地山。亦知名士。故能深表同情。脱略俗節。其從儉之風。足爲世式。著述已刊行者。有洹上私乘。寒雲説集二書。或云。寒雲每日必作日記。寒暑無間。至今已垂二十年。中多朝野秘聞。詩酒韻事。若謀剞劂之。不朽之作也。</p>
<p>鵑按寒雲盟兄。爲愚生平至友之一。往歲客海上。往還無虚日。詩文投贈。積久成帙。愚前編半月紫羅蘭諸雜誌得力於兄者爲多。比年息影津門。音問鮮能。本擬於今歲春暮北上往省。詎噩耗傳來。遽赴玉樓之台。追溯前塵。愴懷曷極。兄著作甚富。日記之作。爲愚前所所親見。字字工楷。文實並茂。以視李　客日記。正無多讓。竊願海内諸友好盡力搜采其遺著。彙爲一編。休之剞劂。以垂久遠也。</p>

<p>— 陳伯英</p>
<p>吳缶老（昌碩）初以篆刻見知於吳愙齋大澂楊藐翁峴。名以漸聞於江左。强仕時。聽鼓蘇垣。性不覊。頗恃才傲物。上峰每不喜之。桐城張祖翼逖先與友善。張工隸。吳工篆。皆有金石癖。張亦工篆刻。蒼勁中姿媚躍出。各樹一幟。二君皆肥碩。短而無須。見者或誤以爲閹人。故吳晚年自稱無須老人云。缶老之篆。勝人處在圓而緊。他人傲之。則僅似其偃蹇之態而已。其刻石用巨刃。吾友張天帚戲稱之天印星大刀吳俊卿。天帚亦嗜篆用巨刃者。急就時不擇器。釘頭剪末。亦能成字。類新莽時銅印。作山水。沈著蒼老。一時無兩矣。缶老於畫。實非所長。而松竹之屬。出以篆法者。亦頗有致。用紅則濃重無法度。人間之。則曰。把些顔色與他看。可發一嘘。</p>

<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>明星歌劇社成立一載餘矣。愚誠綠慳。未得躬預彩排。一聆雅奏。深以爲憾。月之二十二日。該社舉行同樂會於杜美路。劇社同仁。一一粉墨登塲。烏可無紀。惜愚於皮黄一道。完全門外。但覺清歌幽揚。悦目賞心而已。無已。僅就隔座老者侈譚劇藝之言。拾其唾餘。藉供同文一粲。</p>
<p>▲張石川兩　壓臺戲　名導演張石川先生。平時研究銀幕藝術。從未親自表演。自新片「銀幕艷史」出。而張君之容顔。初上鏡頭。茲自「歌女紅牡丹」大功告成。乃一度漏臉於紅氍毹。居然雙齣壓臺戲。是日起落馬湖中之黄天霸。嗓音瞭亮。能與名票得天居士相頡頑。三堂會審。起紅袍藩司。亦能表情入微。無絲毫濡滯。實匪易易。</p>
<p>▲周劍雲唱做工穏　歌劇社長周劍雲先生。亦唱雙齣好戲。與應蘊文女士之探母。與黄雪軒女士之南天門。周先生爲久記票友。做工純熟。臺步工穩。不失前輩典型。行腔道白。一字不苟。所惜者嗓音失潤。想周先生賢勞過甚。少所休息耳。</p>
<p>▲王宣合爨寳蓮燈　王玉書君宣景琳女士是日合爨寳蓮燈。允稱旗鼓相當。已入神化之境。王君爲票界名宿。能戲極多。偶爾登塲。自能脱盡烟火氣。宣女士則歌喉婉轉。深得玉霜神髓。更兼面部身手都能有戲。不愧明星而名票者。歌劇社之臺柱。非宣莫屬矣。</p>
<p>▲武戲之賣力　武戲以徐欣夫吳萬祥兩君合演之白水灘。及黄天蔭君與吳萬祥君之葭萌關爲最賣力。萬祥精於武術。欣夫則爲武俠片導演。儒者風度。居然一反本來面目。董天涯則票戲極久。功架老練。不失規矩。之三君近均從陳月樓君游。武劇之深造。良有以也。</p>
<p>▲紅牡丹之玉堂春　夜戲以鄭小秋顧梅君二君之小放牛爲最多味。此劇寫小兒女情態。艷而不淫。是爲難能。殿後爲紅牡丹主角胡蝶女士與王獻齋君及諸社員合演之三堂會審。胡蝶以表情勝。獻齋以説白勝。老者繼曰。老眼昏花。未能予以準確之品評。但似此成績。已屬難能。加以諸藝友都爲具有天才者。再能加功。下次必更有可觀也云云。</p>

<p>— 曼因</p>
<p>趙鐵橋亦一川中名士也。其對於革命功動。固有相當之歷史。兩年前。在京與秦淮名娼雪林。有一段因緣。人咸知之。然不失爲名士風流。厥後爲上海招商局專員。乃爲人暗殺。身後至爲凄凉。聞趙雖爲招商局專員。而此時該局方在風雨飄搖之秋。北伐方殷。則日以調度船隻。運兵送械。人目之爲膏腴。而一無所潤。中年被戕。遺留兒女極多。且均幼稚。（曾見某報有載趙光祖云云。下註趙鐵橋之子。實則上海另有一趙光祖也。）厥後政府議及趙君恤金時。除特頒治喪費一千元外。經銓叙部核議。照最後在職月俸六百元。按官吏恤金條例。照月俸六百元十分之一。給予遺族恤金年額七百二十元。又按同條例。給予最後在職兩個月俸給之遺族一次恤金一千二百元。但銓部呈文。則云該故專員盡力革命。二十餘年。整理航務。便利戎行。厥功併偉。追念前勳。應隆恤典。此係據條例核議。非對革命功勳之獎恤云云。後經國務會議。特予趙故專員遺族一次恤金三千元。年撫恤金每年九百六十元。在國府亦甚優異。然此每月八十元之恤金。趙夫人撫此繁多之子女。亦殊辛勞艱苦矣。憶去歲之秋。鐵橋之女公子趙銀梅。年不過十二三。在某女校肄業。會有一教師。初不知趙小姐即鐵橋之女也。偶於課中。講及中國航業。詬及趙鐵橋之辦招商局。一無成績云云。趙小姐年雖幼稚。念吾父慘遭鯨鯢。身後尙有人在其女之前。詬及其父。即起立出課堂。痛哭而歸。歸後。母女相抱。痛哭一塲。自此遂不復入此校。嗚呼。此亦非傷必墮淚之一事實耶。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>論及階級制度。博士言此制今尙存。特稍活動耳。第一級爲婆羅門族。凡僧人出家者。必出於此族。他族不得許可。第二王族刹地利族。又名戰士階級。第三商人。第四農奴。四姓不得通婚。農之子恒爲農。工之子恒爲工。如中國管子所云。佛欲打破此制。終至人不信其教。亦可見其勢力之大也。由此可知印度僧人之貴重。蓋有由來。因惟有第一階級。始可爲僧。他級不許。物以罕而見奇。本是貴族。出家更貴也。但此制自度英人入印后。印人感於外力之壓迫。運動解放。近新思想起。漸有變更矣。</p>
<p>是日下午二時。社會教育會請講。有譚覺士賴瑋張國基諸君。盧領事及夫人亦在座。并照相。五時在印度人大乘佛會講堂開大會。女校長Sarala　Dervi主席。乃太戈爾之姪女。屆時到會者六七百人。西女士亦有之。盧領事春芳及夫人均在。衆請盧演説。余演説畢。主席譯成孟加利語。又有老哲人克利須那。Krishna年已七十。辦報五十年。以大聲演説東方文化之放大光明。衆生從此得救。滿座震動。嗣由其女Mrs.　Boss唱歌贊頌。七時散會。</p>
<p>二十四日。訪道階法師未遇。遇緬甸學生於８.　Eden,　Hospital　road。此間爲緬僧佛舍。凡緬僧人及學生禮佛者可住。飯食自備。每月十餘元。中國人亦可住。問緬學生幾何。答十餘人。該佛舍費五萬餘元。招待緬人者也。現在各地佛跡處。均有緬僧佛舍。中國人均可住。火食自備。然則緬甸佛徒。不愧佛教功臣也。緬人謙和。平易可親。如小水無波。而印人氣象廣大無垠。身體亦高大。逈異緬人。緬人天然應附屬於印。乃今謂分治獨立。此乃受英人政治運動故耳。</p>
<p>二十五日下午五時。森女士Mrs-Sen邀茶會。盧及夫人均在。森女士全家住英倫十七　。今始回。所識英士女甚多。如羅素韋爾斯之流。亦甚喜華人云。中華美術爲世界第一。日本美術亦有名。然不及也。囑余待數星期。太戈爾將回國。可共商世界文化運動之方法。余在商塲見有西商店招牌云。China＆glass。即磁與玻璃也。而即用支那字。可知其由來稱磁爲中國矣。</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、似見堅穩之象、因洋麥報價回起一二角不等、天氣又因　寒驟熱、時雨頗急、故近遠期各盤、較之前日之最低價、似回振一分左右、迨至下午各盤、以外行買户、未見起勁、各月份市氣、又復漸疲、兼之交易所之籌碼、聞目下已達一千五百萬以上、以此廠大之貨量、設每至一個月期、銷難敵供、前途之不景氣、仍不免重見也、結果本月份較前日微好二厘半、四月份不動、五六月份好五厘、七八月份好二厘半云、</p>

<p>五福白冰近以申銷不暢、來源减少、茲據厦門函息、該廠現擬暫行停煮、故此後來源勢必更稀、市價不致過鬆、近市陸續開出每、價均爲八兩八錢、趨勢頗挺、其他統手貨以走場寥落、成交殊稀、逐期厦輪到貨、亦屬有限云、</p>

<p>— 文</p>
<p>青年對於文藝之熱切的愛好、我們當也不能不説是一種良佳的現象、自五四新文化運動以後、青年精生活的傾向、就移轉入一個新的階段了、他們對於文藝的追求、實有彌補缺陷和安慰心靈的企圖、雖不免類多是自我的衷現可是在某種意義上的論斷、固未始不是青年急求心靈之歸宿的徵象、以那樣惡劣的環境、一切的現實皆不能滿足了慾望、自然要向這方面傾注起來了、因之像這樣風起雲湧的趨勢、並不是偶然發見的事實、近年來青年文藝集團的組織日見增多、我們但看各學校就可知道了、在不久之前、我們又發現了一個集合各學校青年而組織之文藝集體、名曰萍影社、主其事者爲張逸菲、梅咏賡、梅鴻英等、出版了一張半開報紙之「萍影」月刊、現已出版至第三期、在「發刊詞」上這樣地説明了他們的態度、</p>
<p>萍影社是由幾位眞率的青年組織的、熱血在我們身上、筆握在我們手裏、我們這張小小的報上是披露我們眞率的情緒、時代是這樣可咀咒處在這時代的青年、祗要你的靈魂没有喪失、知覺没有麻木、誰不要感着一種青春的悲哀呢、我們幾位眞率的青年、看不慣社會的醜惡、忍不住内心的苦悶、所以我們將可咀咒的一切内心眞實的情緒表現出來、因此、我們不顧一切地　了這個小小的園地、</p>
<p>由此看來、他們的自我成分之在文藝上的探求、是很强烈的了、然而從另一個價量、正是當前一般青年缺乏意識力的表現、每喜横衝亂撞地來作爲栽培之行事、當然是非常可惜的、「萍影」在命名的意義上、我何固然未能明晰、但以已出的三期的内容觀察、正如噗人生浮萍似影、一種感傷的流露、委實强烈之至、雖然這種悲訴、我們也不能否認其内在之眞實的要求、可是我們站在這樣一個時代階段上的青年、却也並不專需要握起筆描寫一些咀咒的話語、便以爲心神快慰了、我應有更偉大的企求、亦爲充實我們生命之要圖、這裏的作者泰半是中學時代的青年、以故能有此成績、也是不可多得的、不過、要注意的就是不能專爲自己作呌喊、我們旣在文藝的領域内、就應有克服的工夫纔好、未了、謹寄語萍影社諸君、生在此過渡期的青年、本多悲哀的、但我们不應單爲此而抹殺了自己的生命、我覺得目前有部份青好爲訴苦的寫作、簡直有浪費之嫌、希望不要儘那樣滿篇地感傷着、須要積極起來、表現向上努力的情緖、那是我們所希望的、</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After the signing of the Sino-French Vietnam Treaty, the French government has not yet ratified it, causing a major obstacle to our country's export trade. Previously, Chinese silk sold to Vietnam had an annual value of more than 30 million. Since July of the 18th year, the Vietnamese government increased the tax rate on Chinese silk, estimating each hundred kilograms to increase drastically from the old tax of 1,260 francs to 14,000 francs. As a result, the trade of Chinese silk to Vietnam has been blocked, and the losses of merchants are difficult to count. Now that the French Minister, Wilder, has come to Beijing, the silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai has sent telegrams to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urging the French Minister to ask the French government to ratify it immediately to facilitate implementation.

<h3 id="e37">Rubber and Silver <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The problem of international cooperation: it is feared that now is not yet the time for it to have any hope of success. Consider the moves by various countries to remedy low silver prices. Although there are many theories, none have yet been implemented. The high price of gold and the low price of silver have had an impact on commerce, and not just in one country. Although the countries affected want to provide relief, they are unwilling to be the first to do so alone because of the relationships with other countries. But this can still be said to be due to the large number of relationships and the extremely complex situation. Another example is the problem of rubber restrictions. Only Britain and the Netherlands are related by common interests, but they have repeatedly met without reaching an agreement. According to yesterday's Reuters report of rubber industry expert Pegge's remarks, the Dutch Big Five's opposition telegrams do not mean that the Rubber Committee has broken down, but if the Big Five oppose the Dutch government's intervention, then cooperation will be very difficult in the future, and the Dutch government may not implement the restriction measures. As a result, rubber prices on the New York market have fallen sharply. From this point of view, the restriction of rubber production will be the same as the relief of silver prices, and it cannot be implemented.</p>
<p>The results of rubber and silver are like this. Then all international economic cooperation, customs unions, and even larger undertakings such as arms reduction, even after repeated calls and repeated meetings, the result will inevitably be nothing. Even if they succeed, they will still be a formal shell without substance. Because people's hearts and cooperation are still heading in different directions.</p>

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e60">Britain Opposes the German-Austrian Customs Union <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Requests Suspension of Proceedings</p>
<p>Purely Economic, Not Political</p>
<p>No Fear of Legal Research</p>
<p>Representations from German and Austrian Authorities</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 25th - British Ambassador Rumbold, representing the British government, made representations to the German government, requesting that the customs union plan be temporarily suspended at this time to allow the alliance an opportunity to consider it. German Foreign Minister Curtius replied that the German-Austrian agreement was within the meaning of the Geneva Protocol and that there was no reason for the League of Nations to discuss the matter. The German and Austrian governments did not fear legal research into this agreement, but if it was studied from a political point of view, the German government considered it unacceptable because the agreement was purely economic. The negotiations for this agreement will not be completed in a few months because various details need to be resolved.</p>
<p>Reuters, Vienna, 25th - The Austrian Foreign Minister answered the British envoy's inquiry regarding the German-Austrian agreement, saying that the Austrian government believed that this agreement was completely within the scope of the 1922 Geneva Protocol, so Austria did not object to the signatories of the Geneva draft treaty researching this agreement from a legal point of view. However, this agreement is economic in nature and cannot be studied from a political standpoint.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 25th - Premier Curtius's speech at the Chamber of Commerce has been highly valued by all newspapers, and in political circles and the parliament lounge, it has been cited as the sole topic of discussion. It is generally believed that the Premier's firm defense of the German-Austrian partial agreement is a refreshing tonic at a time when discussions are raging across Europe and rumors are flying between Czechoslovakia and France. Curtius repeatedly stated that the German-Austrian tax agreement would never affect existing agreements between the two countries and third countries, nor would it conflict with the interests of other countries. He also said that he firmly believed that the Chamber of Commerce would never misunderstand and that after a fair and rigorous review in the future, it would be able to dispel the surrounding atmosphere of doubt and make neighboring countries deeply believe in the purity of the agreement's aims and objectives because the benefits of the agreement were not limited to Germany and Austria but could be universally applied to Europe. Curtius continued that Germany was forced by its surrounding environment to enter into this new tax agreement because of the payment of indemnities. If Germany wanted to pay the indemnities, it had to reduce imports to the lowest possible level and increase exports far beyond the current quantity. Germany needed to request special treatment in commerce because of the indemnity relationship. Furthermore, the failure of the international tariff truce was not Germany's fault, and Germany had to use its own creativity to find other ways of development. Moreover, Germany resolutely undertook the payment of European war indemnities despite the suffering of the majority of its people. The German Cabinet had also endured many hardships in the past few months. However, new taxes could not be levied, and the indemnities could not be slightly reduced, so Germany had no choice but to conclude a tax agreement with Austria. Therefore, the new tax agreement was only an economic agreement and was ultimately due to the great powers' refusal to reduce indemnities.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - When the House of Commons met today, there were many questions about the German-Austrian customs agreement. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Dalton replied that the government had not negotiated with Germany or Austria or both countries on the issue of a customs union because any such step would greatly change British financial policy, not only with regard to foreign countries but also with regard to the colonies and India. Regarding the German-Austrian customs union, the German ambassador and the Austrian minister had provided the British Foreign Office with information, and now they were closely watching its legal, commercial, and political situation. As for the impact of the proposed agreement on British commerce, it was not yet possible to predict. It would obviously depend on the tax rate levied on imports from other countries when the customs union was implemented. However, members of the House could rest assured that the government would do its utmost to prevent even the slightest damage to the commercial interests of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Bangkok, 26th - The Siamese Minister of Finance stated that the people are willing to use banknotes in place of silver coins, so the national treasury has a large income of silver coins.

<p>Guomin News Agency, Madrid, 25th - Since yesterday's student unrest, when police opened fire and killed five people, open-air rallies have been held everywhere inside and outside the city today, protesting and attacking the cabinet severely. They dispersed only in the evening. Tonight, the security in the capital is as strict as a large military camp. The conservative team and the army, carrying machine guns, are distributed at strategic points, and armored vehicles are patrolling the streets to prevent accidents. The Cabinet's position has been greatly weakened after the revival of this anti-government movement. There are even rumors that Prime Minister Aznar is preparing to resign and that the King will summon Alba, who returned to the country last week, to form a constitutional party cabinet.</p>

<p>Amendment Rejected</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - The Research Association, plagued by internal strife, added a mixed amendment and desired conditions from both the approving and opposing factions in order to save face for both sides of the tax reduction plan, allowing the plan to pass and come to an end. However, the amendment shifts the increased amount of urban residential land rent to rural areas, which is a major social problem given the current exhaustion of rural areas. Therefore, both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have expressed their opposition and strongly advocate respecting the lower house's resolution.</p>
<p>Nichi-Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - The Research Association held a general meeting this afternoon and put the tax reduction plan amendment to a vote. As a result, it was rejected by a margin of 29 votes. It will then decide on the approval or disapproval of the government's original plan.</p>
<p>Nichi-Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - The budget for the Showa 6th year has already been established, and the supplementary budget was also established on the 25th.

<p>Associated Press, Haden, USA, 25th - The testing laboratory of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation today tested a new telecommunications machine for sending public documents and news. This machine can telecommunicate and print 12 pages of text per hour, totaling 180,000 words, and can utilize wireless telegraph and wireless telephone without the drawbacks of noise and air reverberation. During today's test, a total of 60 pages of text printed on ordinary photographic paper were transmitted. American and British journalists who observed it praised its speed and predicted that this new machine would soon be available for commercial use.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Terranuova Bracciolini, Italy, 25th - Today, a new type of airplane capable of changing direction and position on its own was tested at the Viprada airfield in Terranuova Bracciolini, which could not absolutely fall. The inventor is Mr. Balassoni. According to him, this new plane can fly even without an engine or if the engine stops. This device, even at an altitude of 2,000 meters, can automatically maintain its average even if the machine stops due to a malfunction, and can continue to fly 80 to 100 kilometers before landing safely. The Italian Minister of Aviation has expressed great enthusiasm for the new machine and is now selecting outstanding experts from the Aviation Department to carry out tests. If the results can prove that Balassoni's words are reliable, then a new era will be marked in air safety. However, the Italian authorities are unwilling to announce what principle Mr. Balassoni used to balance the airframe and make it absolutely safe.</p>

<p>Guomin News Agency, Hartford, 26th - Chinese Minister Wu Chaoshu gave a speech at the YMCA here today, describing China's economic development and its attitude towards foreign debt and foreign investment, and discussing in detail the various important construction issues at present. He said that China has now begun municipal construction, is working hard to rectify existing railways, build new railways, construct roads, dredge rivers, promote aviation, and encourage new industries. China welcomes foreign investment, but on the part of the people, a kind of guarantee must be obtained because certain very unpleasant experiences have been obtained on previous foreign debts. Therefore, China will carefully conclude all foreign investment contracts in the future, and all that is sufficient to create political superiority and economic aggression will be eliminated. Under this kind of understanding, we are willing to supply foreign investors with conditions that can obtain ordinary benefits. Also, last night, Minister Wu gave a speech at the Providence West Chamber of Commerce in Rhode Island on China's economic development and America's wishes for China's national movement.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Peng Dehuai and Huang Gonglue Surrender <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Huang Gonglue's Family Sent to Hunan as Hostages</p>
<p>Changsha dispatch: Communist bandit leaders Peng Dehuai and Huang Gonglue are both natives of Xiangtan County, Hunan. Peng was a student at the Baoding Military Academy, and Huang was a student at the Whampoa Military Academy. Both were subordinates of the former Division Commander Liu Xing. In 1928, Peng was a regimental commander and Huang a battalion commander, stationed in Pingjiang County. Due to a dispute over military pay, they led their troops in a mutiny, joining the Red bandits. Recently, they have entrusted people three times to express their willingness to surrender to He Jian, requesting to preserve their existing strength and be reorganized into two divisions, with Peng and Huang remaining as division commanders. He Jian, considering the matter of great importance, specially dispatched Chief of Staff Liu Yinggu to Nanjing to request instructions from the central government. The central government then appointed Huang Hanxiang as the military inspector for the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, to handle this matter jointly with He Jian. Huang Hanxiang has been in Hunan for two months and has personally gone to Pingxiang and Ji'an, holding several consultations with Peng and Huang's representatives. Regarding Peng and Huang's request to preserve their troops, he has agreed to handle it with discretion. However, He Jian's intention is that Peng and Huang must demonstrate their anti-communist efforts in practice, cooperate with the National Army, and first carry out the suppression of Zhu De and Mao Zedong to atone for their crimes. Huang Gonglue's family originally hid in Shanghai. Now, to show sincerity, his elderly mother, wife, and two sons have been sent by people from Shanghai to Changsha, handed over to He Jian as hostages. He Jian has ordered them to temporarily reside in Huang Hanxiang's home, treating them with preferential care. Meanwhile, Huang Hanxiang will go to Ji'an again yesterday (23rd) to urge Peng and Huang to quickly eliminate Zhu De and Mao Zedong and lead their troops to return. At the same time, a written exhortation to Peng and Huang's subordinates, printed in 10,000 copies, has been dispatched by aircraft to Peng and Huang's bases in Donggu and Ningdu, Jiangxi, to enlighten them. The wording is as follows: "You were originally revolutionary troops. Unfortunately, due to circumstances, you were temporarily confused and plunged into the vortex of the Communist bandits. Over the years, you have suffered much hardship and committed many evils, abandoning your glorious past history and forfeiting your great future. You yourselves, in the quiet of the night, should search your hearts and weep bitterly. Now, in this final period of communist suppression, you are finally able to awaken and learn, showing that your conscience has not been extinguished and your situation is pitiable. According to the various things presented by the representatives you have sent repeatedly, we know that your environment is extremely difficult, and your return is truly sincere. The central government, being broad-minded, will not blame the past and will grant you a fresh start. Therefore, we have also resolutely agreed to your earnest request. Since you have expressed your sincerity to return, you should not fear obstacles or avoid difficulties, and you should demonstrate your aspirations in practice. Now, fearing that you still have doubts, we especially declare three things to you: (1) You have repeatedly sent representatives to negotiate, and Huang Gonglue has sent his mother and wife to Changsha, which shows that you are deeply repentant and eager to surrender. Now, the armies of the three provinces have been deployed steadily, advancing by land and water, encircling in separate directions, preparing to eliminate the bandits in one fell swoop. You should also take the opportunity to act quickly, cooperate in eliminating Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and other bandit troops, and atone for your crimes, as proof of your thorough repentance. (2) After your surrender, your lives can be absolutely guaranteed completely, and your troops can still exist. Your requests can be considered fully realized. (3) Huang Gonglue's elderly mother and wife, who have been sent to Changsha, are now being properly protected and treated preferentially. Do not worry about them. Your family members also hope that you will return soon to reunite and share the happiness of family life. The past, in all its forms, is like yesterday's death; the future, in all its forms, is like today's birth. Lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot. A great opportunity is fleeting. We hope you will not hesitate or waver, and quickly implement your surrender plan and return to the embrace of the Three Principles of the People." (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">The 19th Route Army Vigorously Suppresses Jiangxi Bandits <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Ma Brigade Recaptures Chongyi, Li Mingrui's Band Flees to Longquan</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Since Jiang Guangnai, commander-in-chief of the 19th Route Army, entered Jiangxi, he has been besieging the bandit troops in Ningdu for days. According to front-line news, Ningdu is the main base of the Zhu-Peng Communist bandits. Now, because the government troops are urgently surrounding Ningdu, the bandit troops have been fleeing in disarray towards Ruijin and Guangchang. The 12th and 22nd pseudo-armies of the Ningdu bandit troops have fled to Huangpi and Xiaobu. The bandit atmosphere in Ningdu has indeed been slightly suppressed, but the peasant bandits near Ningdu City are still rampant. The grain in the villages has been looted by the bandits, and not a single grain remains. Even the bandits themselves only cook one meal per person per day. Over a hundred refugees imprisoned in the Golden Essence Cave were all slaughtered by the bandits. Many women over the age of sixteen were forcibly remarried. The people in the bandit areas were forced to engrave the words "Reddened" on their arms, so even if they do not die at the hands of the bandits, it will be difficult for them to survive. Furthermore, the bandit party in Yudu, since being defeated, has been scarred everywhere, which is shocking. According to Yudu County Magistrate Wang Jingming's report, he led the people's militia from Luojiadu in the western township and Mufeng in the southern township at dawn on the 4th of this month and recovered Yudu City. In this battle, one pseudo-chairman, Huang Fosheng, was killed, one pseudo-captain, Jiang Luo, was beheaded, over ten important leaders were captured, sixty bandits were captured, and three to four hundred civilians who had been kidnapped by the bandits were released. The remaining bandits have now fled and gathered in the Wan'gang and Sanmen Tan areas west of Yudu. Currently, people's militias are being organized in the urban area and the three townships in the east, west, and south to defend key points. The city walls have been torn down to the ground, and slightly larger buildings have been burned to the ground. The people in the entire city, apart from those who fled and were killed by the bandits, only children under the age of ten and old women over the age of fifty remain. The stoves are cold and the households are silent, desolate and unbearable to witness, and even people of iron and stone should shed tears, and so on. The above is about the bandit disaster in eastern Jiangxi. As for the southern Jiangxi area, after places such as Shangyou were recovered, the people's frightened souls had just settled down. Unexpectedly, Li Mingrui's band fled from the Hunan border into Chongyi. Fortunately, the 19th Route Army had pre-emptively sent troops to defend and quickly rushed to support, and Chongyi was recovered. Li's bandits have now fled again to Longquan, Hunan. It was found that when Li's bandits fled to Chongyi this time, the 19th Route Army immediately dispatched Brigade Commander Ma Kun to lead the Ding Regiment and the First Battalion of the Yin Regiment in the rain from Nankang at 6:00 AM on the 3rd. They arrived at Yangmeisi at 7:00 PM to camp. Because the laborers were exhausted and according to the locals, the journey from Yangmeisi to Chongyi was eighty li, mostly consisting of high mountains and steep ridges. Brigade Commander Ma, in order to maintain combat effectiveness, consulted with the regimental and battalion commanders and advanced to Changlongxu on the 4th to camp. At 3:00 PM that afternoon, they arrived at the market town. They received a telegram from headquarters ordering them to occupy the line of the north gate of Chongyi before the 5th and launch a fierce attack on the bandits. The various units then departed from Changlongxu at 6:00 AM on the 5th and advanced towards Chongyi. At about 11:00 AM, the officers and soldiers of the Ding Regiment discovered a bandit sentry five li outside Chongyi City. Seeing the government troops approaching, Li Mingrui used a small force to cover the south gate, while he led the bandits to flee from the north. The Ding Regiment took advantage of the situation to pursue and attack outside the south gate, killing dozens of bandits and seizing more than eighty rifles. They then recovered Chongyi County on the same day at noon. (March 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Zhu Peide Completes Inspection in Xuzhou <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou dispatch: Zhu Peide arrived in Xuzhou on the 22nd. On the 23rd, he held a military parade and separate academic examinations in two subjects. On the morning of the 24th, Zhu, along with inspection committee member Fan Yuhuang and others, inspected the internal affairs of the various units of the Seventh Division, guided by Wang Jun, Zeng Wanzhong, and others. They first inspected the cadre training team, then the division headquarters' special service company, then the 37th and 38th regiments and the 41st and 42nd regiments in the Jiulishan barracks, as well as the artillery and engineering battalions. The inspection items were personnel, horses, cleanliness, hygiene, artillery, ammunition, clothing, equipment, materials, etc. In the afternoon, live-fire shooting exercises were reviewed at Machang Lake, east of the large parade ground in front of Jiulishan. Several soldiers from each company were selected, and officers above the rank of major were present, totaling about five or six hundred people. The target distance was about two hundred meters. At the same time, earthwork operations were also practiced, including infantry kneeling trenches, standing trenches, single-person trenches, and artillery mountain gun shelters, mortar shelters, and machine gun shelters. It was not completed until late at night. On the 25th, from morning to noon, a field exercise was held, which was a confrontation between mixed regiments, divided into east and west armies. The east army was the 42nd Regiment, attached with an artillery company and an engineer platoon, commanded by Regimental Commander Chen Shaohan. The west army was the 37th Regiment, also attached with an artillery company and an engineer platoon, commanded by Regimental Commander Yi Kaizhen. Zhu Peide served as the commander, Fan Yuhuang served as the chief judge of the east army, and Kong Fanqing served as the chief judge of the west army. The commander's flag was a triangular red flag with a white square heart inside. The chief judge's flag was a triangular flag, red on the top and white on the bottom. Personnel in the commander's department and visitors all wore red cloth armbands as identification. The exercise subjects were attack, offensive defense, offensive transfer, and decisive battle, a total of four items. During the exercises, firecrackers were used instead of gunshots. On this day, before 10:00 AM, the east army stopped in battle formation on the Chaizi Kou-Li Jiawo road, with the vanguard at the western end of Yangshan, with the purpose of defending Tongshan. The west army gathered near Lizhuang, about a thousand meters east of the western end of Dagu Mountain, before 8:00 AM, advancing to occupy the position before the battle, with the purpose of attacking Tongshan from Dangshan. The two sides formed a confrontational situation. In order to make it easier for the main force to defeat and drive away the invading enemy, the east army advanced westward north of Jiulishan with a mixed regiment, cutting off the Bian-Xu transportation and forcing the left flank of the west army. At the same time, the west army also occupied positions in the Zhengzhuang, Dagu Mountain, and Qilihe area with a mixed regiment, transferring the offensive at the opportunity. The two sides advanced and attacked each other. At about 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the two armies engaged in a decisive battle at Jiantun, Guishan, and Xiaogu Mountain, which was then completed. During the decisive battle, the soldiers in the front line of the two armies were only about a hundred meters apart, and the two regimental commanders ordered the exercise to stop. The chief judges of the two armies marched and judged along with the troops. Zhu, Wang Jun, and visitors climbed to the peak of Jiulishan to observe the battle. After the exercise, Zhu announced that the review of the various subjects of the Seventh Division had been completed and scheduled a gathering for review and instruction on the morning of the (26th). He will then go west that day. (25th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Course of the Qingdao Local Produce Merchants' Strike <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao dispatch: The strike of local produce merchants in Qingdao is now expanding and becoming a serious problem. If this matter is not resolved one day, the entire city's commerce will be affected. The cause of the strike and the mediation efforts of the party and government authorities are detailed below:</p>
<p>Causes of the Strike: On the first of last month, the guild of cargo companies telegraphed the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan, requesting cancellation of the fact that peanuts and oil shipped to China also had to be inspected and charged before they could be shipped, as it was too harsh. Soon, an telegram was received from the Ministry of Industry, which stated roughly that in consideration of the merchants' difficulties, the Qingdao Commodity Inspection Bureau had been ordered to exempt all non-foreign commodities from inspection fees, except for cotton that had been thoroughly inspected and commodities specially approved by the ministry due to special circumstances. At the same time, the Commodity Inspection Bureau also issued an announcement in accordance with the order, stipulating that free of charge would be implemented first on the 23rd, and the items that should be excluded would be stipulated by the ministry. Not long after, the bureau sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, stating that according to the Ministry of Industry's telegram, peanuts and oil in the commodities were prone to mold and often mixed with impurities, which were related to food. Regardless of whether they were exported or sold domestically, they still had to be inspected and charged. Upon hearing the news, the local produce merchants immediately wrote to the bureau, stating that the goods sold by various companies in the past few days were all in Da Wen Kou, Jinan, etc. Now that they have received the notice, they still have to pay inspection fees. However, domestic transportation is delayed, making it difficult to catch up. They are now requesting exemption from the ministry, and they are still willing to refer to free of charge within these three weeks. At the same time, they wrote to the Ministry of Industry again, stating that Qingdao's local products include several types, which have all been generously exempted from inspection fees. However, only peanuts and oil, which are related to the people's livelihood and daily necessities, have resumed inspection fees, which is unfair. Unexpectedly, the Ministry of Industry's approval did not arrive, and the Inspection Bureau issued another announcement on the 13th, stating that according to the Ministry of Industry's telegram, the request for a three-week postponement of the inspection fees for peanuts should be approved, and the Ministry of Industry's telegram should still be followed upon expiration. It also stated that the fees would be implemented on the 16th, expiring on March 14th. The local produce merchants were extremely frightened because they had not received the ministry's approval and the bureau suddenly announced the imposition of fees. They requested the bureau to postpone it again, but the bureau refused, and the strike broke out as a result.</p>
<p>Focus of the Dispute: The Inspection Bureau's side believes that peanuts and oil are Qingdao's only major export, and tens of thousands of yuan in fees can be collected annually. The bureau's expenses depend entirely on this income. If these two items are once exempted from fees, the bureau will be unable to support itself. Therefore, the local produce merchants believe that first, the bureau's fees are too high (five cents per picul for peanuts and nine cents per picul for peanut oil), second, there are many procedures for inspection, obtaining tickets, and paying fees, which require more partners, third, waiting for inspection often delays shipping schedules and suffers losses due to market price fluctuations, and fourth, inspection bureaus everywhere do not inspect or charge fees for goods sold domestically. It is unfair for Qingdao to do so alone. Therefore, they also firmly oppose it and will not stop until they achieve their goal.</p>
<p>Mediation Situation: After the local produce merchants went on strike, important figures from the party and government went to the Inspection Bureau to discuss mediation methods with Director Mou Junde. The bureau has replied to the municipal government that starting from the 23rd, peanuts and oil sold domestically will still be reported for inspection, but fees will be temporarily waived, and they will wait for the Ministry of Industry to approve and handle it. However, the local produce merchants' attitude is still extremely firm and they refuse to report for inspection. Also, when the party and government authorities were mediating, the bureau stated that without inspection, the customs would not allow release, and they still had to ask the Ministry of Finance for instructions. The local produce merchants then elected representatives to go to the customs and meet with the tax commissioner to inquire about the matter. The tax commissioner stated that regarding goods sold overseas, according to the ministry's order, they are not allowed to be exported without an inspection certificate. As for goods sold domestically, if the Inspection Bureau sends a letter explaining the situation, the customs can release them. The representatives then went to the bureau yesterday to meet with the director, explained the process of contacting the customs, and asked the director to send a letter to the customs to allow release. The director replied that this matter is being implemented in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Industry, and he does not have the authority to dare to obey the order. This negotiation has still yielded no results. (March 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Central Committee Member Gui Chongji Comes to Wuhu for Inspection <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu dispatch: Central Committee Member Gui Chongji came to Anhui to inspect the party affairs of the entire province of Anhui. He first went to Anqing from Nanjing and stayed for about two weeks. A few days ago, he took the Anfeng charter boat from Anqing to Datong for inspection and stayed in Tong for three days. Today (24th) at 5:00 PM, he took the boat back to Wuhu. All sectors of the Wuhu party and government welcomed him at the Jianggan Pier. Gui and his entourage, including Xiao Fengwei and Qiu Zhanwu, secretaries of the Central Propaganda Department, got off the boat and went to the Southeast Hotel on Zhongshan Road to rest. Then, they met with reporters from local newspapers and announced the situation of the inspection of party affairs in Anhui Province, roughly stating that since the reorganization of party affairs in Anhui, the organization has indeed become more rigorous and the work has also made considerable progress. However, although mass organizations have been reorganized and established one after another, I am not clear about the goals of their own work, which is a common problem of mass organizations. I hope to pay attention to this. It is reported that Gui will stay in Wuhu for about four or five days and then transfer to Hefei. After inspecting in Hefei for three days, he will return to Wuhu and take the road back to Nanjing. Accompanying staff will be sent to Xuan City, Fanchang, and other counties for inspection.

<h3 id="e77">High Ying's Appeal Case Argument Concludes <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Verdict Scheduled for the 30th of This Month</p>
<p>Former San Francisco Vice Consul Gao Ying, his wife Liao Suqiu, and Chief Clerk Sun Yuan were apprehended by US customs officials for trafficking opium. They were extradited back to China, and after first and second trials by the Jiangning Local Court and the Jiangsu Higher Court, Gao Ying was sentenced to six years of imprisonment and a fine of six thousand yuan for opium trafficking and attempted bribery. Sun Yuan was sentenced to five years of imprisonment and a fine of five thousand yuan. Liao Suqiu was sentenced to four years of imprisonment and a fine of four thousand yuan. Each of them appealed to the Supreme Court, which, on October 6th of last year, rejected the appeal of Gao and Liao, but remanded the cases of Gao Ying and Sun Yuan for a new trial. Today (the 26th), at 2:00 PM, the Jiangsu Higher Court's Criminal Division Presiding Judge Lin Dawen, Judges Lin Zhezhang and Zhang Bingci, Prosecutor Zhu Wenzhuo, and Clerk Liu Suize convened the trial. Gao and Liao have been seriously ill recently and were originally unable to attend the court. However, due to their crucial involvement in the case, a cardiotonic injection was administered by the prison doctor, Ruan Jiemin, at 12:00 AM in the prison, and they were reluctantly carried to the High Court in rattan chairs. Of the witnesses summoned, one was Chen Yiyi, the former Mexican Consul who had already completed his term and been released, and the other was Gong Anqing, the former San Francisco Consul General. However, neither Chen nor Gong reported for duty. Chen Yiyi had already left for Japan on the 18th of this month to seek employment, and his wife, Chen Yang Wenbin, reported in his place. After the court convened, Gao Ying's lawyers, Wang Youling and Liu Shifang, and Sun Yuan's lawyers, Li Zongqian and Lu Jianai, appeared in court together. They announced the conclusion of the argument in court, and the verdict was scheduled for 1:00 PM on the 30th of this month. The details of the court hearing are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The court convened at 2:00 PM. First, Gao Ying was questioned. The judge asked his age, and he replied thirty-six years old. Asked where he was from, he replied Fujian. Asked his occupation, he replied that he was formerly the Vice Consul at the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco. Asked that the Jiangning Local Court sentenced you for helping to smuggle opium, and you appealed, and later you still refused to accept it and appealed again, and the Supreme Court sent it back for retrial. Could you please state your reasons for the appeal again? He replied that because he was completely unaware of the opium smuggling matter beforehand and did not conspire, he disagreed with the verdict. As for the dereliction of duty, although Chen Yiyi had sent a letter requesting assistance, he did not agree. His reasons for the appeal were as such.</p>
<p>Sun Yuan was then questioned. Asked his age, he replied forty-one years old. Asked where he was from, he replied Zhongshan, Guangdong. Asked his occupation, he replied that he was a chief clerk at the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco. Asked if he had previously been the secretary of the consulate, he replied yes, before September of the 17th year of the Republic. Asked who arrived at the consulate first, Gao Ying or himself, he replied that he arrived first. Asked how many chief clerks were at the San Francisco Consulate, he replied one. Asked if the consulate should send someone to pick up Chinese people arriving in the United States, he replied not necessarily, only if there was a notification. Asked if Gao Ying and Gao Liao Suqiu arrived in the United States at the same time, he replied yes. Asked how many times Liao Suqiu had returned to China, he replied two or three times, somewhat vague, he couldn't remember. Asked if he knew Wen Yuxian Shen Guang, he replied that he did not. Asked that Wen Yuxian sent him a letter, if he did not know him, why would he give him a letter, he replied that he did not see Wen Yuxian's letter, or it was fabricated. Asked if he had ever seen this letter, he replied that he only saw it in court later. Asked that Wen Yuxian asked Gao Liao Suqiu in his letter, "Please trouble brother to open the overseas box personally, check the numbers and transfer them," since he did not recognize him, it would have been better to directly hand it over to Gao Liao Suqiu, why hand it over to him to transfer, he replied that he really did not know. Asked that the letter said to hand over number two and number eleven to Shou Nan, and the rest to Ruo Yun, then did he recognize Shou Nan and Ruo Yun, he replied that he did not recognize either of them. Asked that there were a total of two thousand two hundred and ninety-nine cans of opium, and he stated the prices and numbers very clearly in the letter, since he did not recognize him, why was it so clear, he replied that this needed to be asked of the person carrying it. Asked since he did not recognize the person, how would he transfer the goods, he replied that he could not transfer the goods if he did not recognize the person. Asked if Wen Yuxian had sent a letter before Gao Liao Suqiu returned to the United States, he replied no. Asked when Gao Liao Suqiu arrived in San Francisco, he replied July 5th. Asked how he knew, he replied that Gao Ying told him that his wife was coming back soon. Asked if there were any other words, he replied no. Asked if Gao Ying went to pick her up when Gao Liao Suqiu arrived at the dock, he replied that he did not go because Consul General Gong was not there. Asked if he went to be questioned by the Americans after the incident, he replied that he went to turn himself in because it involved him. Asked according to his statement, then he had not contacted beforehand, he replied yes.</p>
<p>Gao Ying was questioned again. Asked if he had another name called Jiande, he replied yes, it was his courtesy name. Asked when he arrived in San Francisco, he replied May of the 14th year. Asked if Liao Suqiu was his wife, he replied yes. Asked how many times Gao Liao Suqiu had returned to China, he replied three times. Asked when was the most recent time, he replied January 4th of the 18th year of the Republic. Asked when she returned to the United States, he replied July 5th. Asked why she returned to China, he replied because she was not feeling well, and she returned to the country with friends and relatives. Asked if he knew Wen Yuxian Shen Guang, he replied that he did not know. Asked if Gao Liao Suqiu had told him about bringing opium, he replied no. Asked if he had received a letter beforehand, he replied yes, he said he was coming back on the Tenyo Maru. Asked if this letter was still kept, he replied that it was lost. Asked how he knew that Gao Liao Suqiu was carrying opium, he replied that because the luggage was detained, he went to the customs to check, and the people at the customs told him so. Asked if he later sent a telegram asking Minister Wu to intercede, he replied yes, when drafting the telegram, he only</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>knew it was a small amount and did not know it was opium. Asked since he did not know beforehand, why did he say in the telegram to Minister Wu, "My wife is returning on the Tenyo, there are a few drugs in the boxes, brought by my wife under the instigation of others," etc., he replied that after Gao Liao Suqiu returned, he asked her, and she said that Chen Sheng asked her to bring the luggage, and he thought this was inappropriate, and the tax officer's words must have a basis, so he guessed that she was being instigated by others. Asked if the letter did not have Chen Sheng's name, only writing that the shipper was Wen Yuxian Shen Guang, was this Chen Sheng a fake name, he replied that he did not know at all. Asked if he went when the boxes were opened, he replied that he was not present when his three pieces of luggage were opened. Asked that the sender was Shen Guang Wen Yuxian, the deliverer was Sun Yuan, and the recipients were Shou Nan Ruo Yun, since the case had been discovered, why did he not investigate, he replied that the American judicial system was different from China's, and the letter was not published. Asked that he did not know Shou Nan Ruo Yun in the United States, he replied that most people in San Francisco were from Guangdong, and he rarely associated with those people. Asked if the diplomatic seal and consulate signature were given to Gao Liao Suqiu by him, he replied no, the consulate did not have signatures and diplomatic seals. Asked if he sent a telegram to Minister Wu asking the customs to waive inspection, whether to take the opium back, he replied no, because if opium was found during the inspection, it would be related to the national dignity, so he thought if the inspection was waived, then the luggage would be returned.</p>
<p>The judge then questioned about the dereliction of duty. Asked if he knew Chen Yiyi, he replied yes, he was the Mexican Vice Consul. Asked when Mei Guang and four others arrived in the United States, and when Chen Yiyi wrote a letter to him, he replied around May of the 17th year, and then another letter came ten days later, asking him to agree, which was enough to prove that he did not collude. At that time, after he received the letter in the United States, he immediately refused because the United States paid great attention to the landing of overseas Chinese, and they must have a passport from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since he earnestly requested it, then this passport was probably not formal. In the second letter, he said that if there was no reply in a month, he would call them to the United States. At that time, he immediately replied to him, probably he did not receive his letter because the postal route from China to the United States took twenty-one to twenty-three days. Regarding this matter, he repeatedly telegraphed him for assistance, but he never agreed. Asked if he had ever asked the Consul General for Chen Yiyi, he replied that because Chen Yiyi did say so in the telegram, he had reported the situation to the Consul General. Asked when Mei Guang and four others arrived in San Francisco, he replied June 8th. Asked if he had ever been on their ship, he replied that because Chen Yiyi had asked him, he went specifically to tell the immigration bureau to check their passports, and if they were forged, they should be detained. Asked if he took it back after the passport was found to be forged, he replied yes.</p>
<p>Sun Yuan was questioned again. Asked if Gao Ying went to the ship after Mei Guang and four others arrived in the United States, he replied yes. Asked him to describe what happened, he replied that after Gao Ying went to the ship, he returned to report to the Consul General, saying that four Chinese people were using fake passports. The Consul General then told him, "You go check again." After he went to check, the situation was the same as what Gao Ying said. Gao Ying took the passports.</p>
<p>Then Gao Liao Suqiu was questioned. Ms. Liao's health was deteriorating, and she was supported to the court by bailiffs. When asked her name and age, she nodded to indicate. The judge asked if she went to San Francisco with Gao Ying, and she replied yes. Asked if the boxes were entrusted to be carried, she replied that Chen Sheng did it, and they were handed over to her in Guangdong. Asked what was inside, she replied that she did not know. Asked if the diplomatic seal and the consulate signature were given to her by Gao Ying, she replied no. Asked where they came from, she replied to ask people from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Asked if the two letters in the box were from Sun Yuan, Shou Nan and Ruo Yun, did she recognize these two people, she replied no. Asked if she had told Gao Ying about the things in the box, she replied no. Asked if she was not detained after arriving in San Francisco on July 5th, she replied yes, she went home immediately, and later went to the countryside to see the children and came back on the eighth. Asked since she did not tell her husband, how did her husband know that she was being instigated by others to smuggle drugs, she replied that after being detained by customs, her husband asked her, and she said that Chen Sheng asked her to bring luggage, and she feared that there were toxic substances inside. Asked if she had written to Gao Ying before going to San Francisco, she replied yes, only to ask him to pick her up. At this point, the judge asked Gao Ying again, did Liao Suqiu go to the countryside immediately after arriving in San Francisco, he replied yes, because there was still a child in the countryside.</p>
<p>Finally, Chen Yiyi's wife, Yang Wenbin, was questioned. Yang supplied that she was thirty-two years old, from Huangni Bridge, Wuxi. Asked why her husband did not come, she replied that since he was implicated in the criminal case, he went to Japan on the 18th to earn a living because he had no means of livelihood. Asked if she was representing him in court today, she replied yes, because the court summoned her husband, and she dared not not come. Asked if she was summoned today because she was a witness in Gao Ying's attempt to bribe, she replied that her husband did not know. After the questioning, Prosecutor Zhu stood up to argue, followed by Lawyer Wang and others who stood up to argue one after another. The court announced the conclusion of the argument and scheduled the verdict for the 30th of this month.</p>

<p>Notorious Bandit Zhu Luo Amei Arrested The banditry in Punan has spread throughout the towns and villages of Songjiang and Jinshan counties, with almost no safe haven. Those with some wealth in the countryside have all been victimized, causing many to move to Songjiang and Shanghai.

<p>Municipal Government Plans to Dredge West Lake The Hangzhou Municipal Government believes that the siltation of West Lake has become increasingly serious in recent years, which is not only related to the scenery but also affects farmland. It has specially planned fundamental dredging methods, first blocking and building bridge holes in Su and Bai causeways, building four earthen dams, using water pumps to pump dry the accumulated water, and requisitioning 3,500 civilian workers to excavate the silt. The area of dredged mud is about 2,149,500 square meters, and the standard is to deepen the exposed lake surface by 50 centimeters. It is estimated that 645,000 cubic meters of earth will be excavated to fill the low-lying areas of the entire lake. The total cost is estimated at 200,000 yuan. Mayor Chen believes that the project is large and expensive, and the provincial treasury is short of funds, making it difficult to implement. Yesterday, he ordered the Public Works Bureau to re-reduce the audit so that the cost is lighter and easier to undertake, and construction can start immediately.</p>

<p>According to reliable sources from the Central News Agency, the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement is a one-sided treaty. The Japanese side has always relied on this agreement as a tool for cultural aggression against our country. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on a letter from the Ministry of Education, has repeatedly instructed Ambassador Wang Rongbao in Japan to negotiate with the Japanese side to abolish it. For more than a year, it has been heard that the Japanese side has consistently refused to agree.

<h3 id="e89">Primary and Secondary Schools Should Emphasize Labor Work and Production Operations <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a circular to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, instructing primary and secondary schools to increase work courses, vocational training, and labor operations, and to report the progress of implementation for review and approval. The circular stated, "It has been found that primary and secondary school education in our country has not paid enough attention to labor work and production operations. Therefore, graduates of various schools are generally unable to work hard or engage in labor, and have no ability to engage in vocational production. At a time when production is declining and people's livelihood is withering, school education cannot adapt to the needs of society to seek remedies, but instead cultivates a large number of young people who have higher desires and specialize in dividing benefits, resulting in graduates who have no skills to support themselves and earn a living, which is not only useless to society, but also has an impact that will make society more unstable. This is a past shortcoming in education that we should strive to correct. The educational purpose of the Republic of China promulgated by the central government has three major points: "enriching the people's lives, supporting social survival, and developing the people's livelihood." Within the implementation guidelines, it is further stipulated that "general education must be based on the teachings of Premier Sun Yat-sen, and ... cultivate the people's lives and increase the people's production capacity as the main purpose," etc., which are meant to remedy deficiencies and have good intentions. All our educational institutions should adhere to and comply with them and not allow them to be overlooked. In order to implement this educational purpose and remedy the shortcomings of education, the specific matters that should be done and handled are listed below: (1) Public and private primary schools must strictly implement the work courses as stipulated in the temporary standards of the primary school curriculum promulgated by the ministry; (2) Public and private junior high schools must strictly comply with the agriculture, industry, and home economics courses as stipulated in the temporary standards of the junior high school curriculum promulgated by the ministry, and carefully comply with them in light of local conditions; (3) Public and private primary and secondary school students must participate in labor work within the school, and special attention should be paid to production operations in each subject; (4) When provincial, municipal, and county supervisors conduct inspections, they should pay special attention to the results of agriculture, industry, home economics, and other subjects (5) The department should carry out propaganda and promotion for labor production education in many ways, so that society and families can understand the current trend of our country. All the above points should be supervised and complied with separately. If the equipment is insufficient and teachers are difficult to obtain, funds should be increased within a limited time to enrich the content, and teachers should be trained in many ways within the scope of the department in charge in order to achieve practical results. The progress of the handling should be prepared and checked. This order.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Ministry Order on Mongolian and Tibetan Areas Preparing Social Education <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education orders the various banners and chiefs of Mongolia and Tibet to swiftly prepare for public education, such as literacy campaigns, public schools, public libraries, public reading rooms, and popular lecture halls, etc., in order to popularize education in the border regions. The detailed outlines for public school measures and the literacy campaign propaganda plan are also issued, and they are to be followed accordingly. The order states: "Upon investigation, social education in our country has made considerable progress in the inland provinces in recent years. However, Mongolia and Tibet are located in remote border areas with backward cultures, and social education is still in its infancy. In order to promote education in these border regions, in addition to vigorously promoting and expanding Mongolian and Tibetan school education, special attention should also be paid to social education in Mongolia and Tibet. The main facilities for social education are literacy campaigns, public schools, public education centers, public libraries, public reading rooms, and popular lecture halls, etc. These organizations are simpler than all the facilities of school education and are also easier to prepare. Therefore, a special order is issued to the banners and chiefs to follow this instruction, quickly set up the above-mentioned important social education institutions as appropriate, so that the general public can have opportunities to seek knowledge, and border education can be gradually developed. This is of utmost importance." The detailed outlines for public school measures and the literacy campaign propaganda plan are also issued, and they are to be followed accordingly. (</p>

<p>Previously, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education received a report from the Haiyan County Government stating that various education funds collected under the consolidated tax had been abolished, making it impossible to compensate for the losses. It requested that the Finance Department be consulted to allocate the funds in the same amount when the business tax was implemented. The Department of Education believed that this situation was not unique to Haiyan County. After investigation, other counties and cities should also be handled in the same way regarding the education funding that should be allocated to compensate for the abolition of the Likin tax. Furthermore, the Provincial Government Committee had previously resolved at its 380th meeting to instruct the Department of Education to jointly investigate with the Finance Department to determine the exact amount and negotiate for allocation. However, the investigation and reply for this case would take time, and the counties and cities urgently needed the aforementioned education funding. It was inconvenient to suspend it because of this. It was proposed to forward the matter to the Finance Department for investigation and to instruct the current business tax bureaus in various districts to allocate the funds as soon as they are collected and forward them to the county and city governments for emergency use. In the meantime, the Department of Education would wait for the counties and cities to report completely and then negotiate with the Finance Department to make an overall allocation and submit it to the Provincial Government for approval. The Finance Department replied that the education funding that had been allocated from the consolidated tax surtax was now without resources due to the abolition of the Likin tax. Since the Provincial Government Committee had resolved to investigate the amount and allocate it, it should be handled accordingly. As soon as the business tax is implemented, separate orders will be issued to comply. The Finance Department also informed the Department of Education for review. The Department of Education specifically informed Haiyan County yesterday and separately instructed the county and city governments to instruct their subordinate education bureaus and the education fund association, and also forwarded the information to the local business tax bureaus.</p>

<p>Chen Boqing has been the principal of Hangzhou Municipal Middle School for four months. Chen is engaged in physical education and is not familiar with education. Therefore, he also serves as the director of academic affairs, but has not convened a meeting of the academic affairs committee. Many of the teachers employed do not meet the qualifications. He has arbitrarily reduced the number of training staff and increased the principal's salary, hired accounting staff, and excessively admitted auditors. He is usually irresponsible and perfunctory. Recently, he arbitrarily changed classrooms without issuing a notice in advance, which caused students to question him. Afterwards, he had no solution. Without the consent of the training office, he expelled six students with excellent academic performance, including Yu Tongling, Tan Wenbang, and Shen Kuan, which led to a strike.</p>

<p>Measures Have Been Drafted</p>
<p>Meeting to be Held on the 29th Morning</p>
<p>In the year before the founding of the Republic, after the failure of the Guangzhou New Army Uprising, the Kuomintang decided to try again. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Kuomintang, convened Huang Xing, Hu Hanmin, Zhao Boxian, and others at the British-owned Penang for a secret meeting. It was decided to mobilize the elite of the entire party to make a desperate move. The date of the uprising was originally set for March 15, but later it was postponed to the 29th due to the fact that the military equipment and funds were not fully equipped, and the stricter precautions taken by the Qing officials due to the Wen Shengcai assassination of Fu Qi. Huang Xing arrived in the province in advance, and the comrades who were going to die gathered together. After a meeting, they wrapped white cloth around their arms, carried sharp weapons, and rushed to the Liangguang Governor's Office. It was 5:30 PM on March 29 of the Xinhai year. Although the Qing officials were prepared, they failed. However, the heroic spirit of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, who fought with iron and blood and were the pioneers of the people, was enough to wake up the Chinese people and save the nation from disaster. The spread of revolutionary ideas throughout the country and the success of the Xinhai Revolution in one fell swoop were due to the merits of the martyrs of Huanghuagang. The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department has drafted commemorative measures and submitted them to the Municipal Executive Committee for deliberation. The measures have now been fully approved. The following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>Commemoration aspects (1) At 9:00 AM on March 29, party departments at all levels, agencies, and groups shall send four representatives to the third floor of the Municipal Party Department to hold a commemorative meeting. (2) Agencies, groups, and schools may hold commemorative meetings separately. (3) Districts far from the city, such as Jiangwan, Wusong, Pudong, Zhenru, and Meilong, may hold commemorative meetings separately. (4) The Municipal Party Department shall notify all circles in the city: (1) all flags in the city shall be flown at half-mast for one day, (2) banquets and entertainment shall be suspended for one day, (3) all citizens shall wear black gauze on their arms for one day, (4) all trams and buses in the city shall fly flags at half-mast for one day, (5) the entire city shall have a holiday for one day.</p>
<p>Propaganda aspects (1) Main propaganda points: (1) based on the commemorative methods for revolutionary memorial days, (2) based on the propaganda outline issued by the central government. (2) Propaganda materials: (1) leaflets, (2) slogans, (3) a letter to compatriots and comrades, (4) a special issue of Party Voice, (5) special commemorative issues published in various districts, (6) commemorative albums, (7) major newspapers publish portraits of martyrs and publish special issues.

<p>Tang Liu, the newly appointed director of the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, assumed his post at the office at 11:00 AM yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tang Liu's Remarks: When Director Tang arrived, the former deputy director, Liu Yunfang, happened to be present as well. As the two were old acquaintances, they went to the director's office for a pleasant chat, during which they also discussed matters regarding the handover.</p>
<p>Convening a Meeting and Giving Instructions: Subsequently, they went to the reception room and gathered all the staff. Mr. Liu Yunfang introduced them one by one. Director Tang Liu then gave a brief address, generally expressing his hope that all colleagues would work diligently together with one heart and mind.</p>
<p>Handling the Handover: After the address, Director Tang designated staff to handle the inventory process. It is said that the files were quite simple, as the archives of the former Jiangsu Negotiation Office had been transferred to the ministry for safekeeping, so there weren't many files in the office. However, the equipment was relatively complex, and the inventory was not completed yesterday and will continue today.</p>
<p>Taking Over the Discussion Committee: Chen Shiguang, the former director of the secretariat of the Foreign Affairs Discussion Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, did not attend the handover yesterday due to being on vacation. Therefore, Zhao Tiezhang, the section chief of the discussion committee and concurrently the section chief of the office, handled the handover procedures. According to Director Tang, although it wasn't necessary to hold a separate inauguration ceremony for the director of the secretariat of the discussion committee, he had effectively taken over the position at the same time.</p>
<p>Tang's Remarks: Director Tang told reporters from the news agency yesterday that diplomacy relies entirely on public opinion as its backing, and newspapers are the mouthpiece of the people, the means by which public opinion is expressed. He expressed his sincere hope to be in contact with the press at all times in the future, so as to facilitate communication.</p>
<p>Meeting with Reporters: Director Tang has designated that all news to be released during his office hours will be handled by him personally when he is in the office. When he is out on official business, section chief Zhao Tiezhang will take over the reception.</p>
<p>Tang's Biography: Tang Liu, courtesy name Nianci, is 30 years old and from Zhongshan County, Guangdong. He is the son of Mr. Tang Shaoyi. He holds a bachelor's degree from Fudan University in Shanghai. He has served as a chief clerk at the Chinese embassy in the United States, an assistant secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a third secretary at the Chinese embassy in the United States, a secretary in the Ministry of Justice, a member of the Communications Research Committee of the Ministry of Communications, a consul in Batang, a consul in Surabaya, an inspector of the Ministry of Communications stationed in Surabaya, a counselor and advisor to the Northeast Border Defense Army, a consul in Nagasaki, a consul-general in Singapore, and a member of the Foreign Affairs Discussion Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Wuxi Silk Industry Opposes Freight Rate Increase <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Planning to Use Water Transportation for Relief</p>
<p>The Wuxi County Silk Factory Association believes that since the Jinghu, Huhangyong and other routes implemented fare increases, the freight rates have also been increased by 20% at the same time, which has a huge impact on the entire silk industry. Moreover, at the end of last year, various industries, due to the slump in the silk industry, collectively sought relief and reported to the government for approval to issue 8 million yuan in silk industry relief bonds, which will be announced and issued soon to maintain the inherent industry. However, the railway bureau is increasing freight rates at this time, which seems to be contrary to the government's intention to provide relief. From the perspective of silk merchants, they cannot bear the heavy burden any longer. Moreover, when the Yongtailong Transportation Company, which was carrying silk freight cars, had an accident in Shanghai in 1927, the losses of various factories reached nearly 200,000 yuan. Because negotiations with the railway bureau at that time were ineffective, the industry had jointly decided to switch to water transport. Later, the railway bureau sent personnel to mediate and promised to find ways to compensate for the losses within a few years, so the factories abandoned this idea. It has only been three years since then, and suddenly, a price increase is being implemented, which is inconsistent with the previous agreement and not a blessing for merchants. Therefore, the factories held a meeting the day before yesterday and decided to request the railway bureau to waive the increase or give them a special price. Otherwise, in order to take care of their capital, they would have to stop transporting by rail and switch to waterways.</p>
<h3 id="e121">News from the Civil Assembly Election Office <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Large Numbers of Labor Unions Submit Registration Forms: The Shanghai Municipal Election Office for National Assembly Representatives received registration forms yesterday from more than ten labor unions, including the Postal Workers' Union and the Inland River Shipping Union. Those that have been reviewed and printed first include the Duck Slaughtering Workers' Union, the Pudong District Loading and Unloading Workers' Union, the Preserved Meat Workers' Union, and the Soy Sauce Workers' Union, among others. It is reported that yesterday was the final deadline, so as of 5:00 PM in the afternoon, a large number of labor unions were still submitting registration forms.</p>
<p>The Labor Circle Forms a Proposal Research Association: Comrades in the Shanghai labor circle, considering that the upcoming opening of the National Assembly is of great importance to the future of labor, Hu Shouqi, Chen Peide, Yang Youren, and others initiated the establishment of the Shanghai Labor Circle Proposal Research Association for the National Assembly. Participants include Hou Dachun, Gu Junfeng, Lu Jingshi, Zhou Xuexiang, Gu Yongquan, Li Daofa, and Tao Baichuan. The first meeting was held yesterday at the Municipal Party Headquarters. After deliberation, the scope of research includes amending the Trade Union Law, the Factory Law, and the Labor Dispute Resolution Law, as well as proposing to the National Government the establishment of a labor department, paying attention to labor education, labor insurance, and effectively relieving unemployed workers. People have been nominated to take charge of research, and it is planned to solicit participation from those in the city who are experienced in researching labor issues. Labor unions or individuals who have opinions to participate are also welcome and can send letters to the Civil Training Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters for transfer.</p>
<p>Civil Servants Can Also Be Elected: Regarding the question of whether civil servants (i.e., current officials) have the right to be elected in the election of National Assembly representatives, Mayor Zhang Yuejun of Shanghai previously telegraphed the central government for interpretation. It is now reported that a reply has been received, stating that civil servants also have the right to be elected, but after being elected, they must suspend their duties and go to Beijing to attend the meeting, and they can only resume their duties after the congress is over.</p>

However, the required funds are very large and should be raised first for application. The committee submitted a document to the municipal government for approval and allocation. It is now learned that the municipal government believes that the river dredging project is indeed urgent, and the required funds are approved for the allocation of 100,000 taels of silver, with 20,000 taels of silver allocated each year to be cleared in five years.

<p>Houses Needed for the County Government and Other Purposes</p>
<p>The location of the Shanghai county seat has been determined to be west of Hu-Min Road and north of Beihui Road. Therefore, the Ren Zhi Committee requested the County Government to forward the request to the Construction Bureau to conduct remote surveying in order to design a plan for the new county seat. Director Wu, upon receiving the order, dispatched Gong, the section chief of the technical section, along with surveyors and survey workers to the countryside yesterday to conduct the surveying. It is estimated that if the weather is clear, the surveying can be completed by the end of this month. The County Government is deeply concerned that the villagers may misunderstand and has issued a notice.</p>

<h3 id="e125">The Taxpayers' Association Sent a Letter to the Public Works Bureau Yesterday Requesting That It Not Overestimate Rent for Tax Collection <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Cannot Bear Any Extra Taxes</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau yesterday regarding the matter of the municipal general tax being levied according to the actual rent. The letter stated: "With respect to the municipal general tax, it should be levied according to the actual rent. We have already sent a letter to your bureau requesting that you strictly comply. We have now received letters from Tongdetang, Zhongdeyuan, Yongchangtai, Juxing Printing Bureau, and other firms stating that each of their firms received a notice from the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession on December 22nd, arbitrarily increasing the housing tax by more than double. They sent letters protesting, stating that they received a letter from your bureau stating that according to Article 5 of the resolution of the taxpayers' annual meeting, the annual rental amount for the houses at numbers 436, 437, 446, and 447 on Henan Road should be increased from 1,404 yuan each to 3,162 yuan. Your bureau will begin collecting taxes according to the new amount on January 1, 1931. If there are any protesters, they should submit a letter to your bureau's general office for review within 14 days from today. We were shocked and horrified. We have investigated and found that the annual rent for each building of the houses we currently occupy is 1,008 taels of silver (i.e., 84 taels per month). We do not know what basis your bureau has for violating its consistent and fair attitude, ignoring the facts, and arbitrarily setting a harsh precedent, increasing the amount from 1,404 yuan to 3,162 yuan per building, which exceeds our actual rent by more than double. We cannot accept this disregard for the facts and arbitrary increase. The intention of Article 5 of the resolution of the taxpayers' annual meeting is nothing more than to provide relief for self-owned properties, and rent is a matter of fact. This is completely different from the intention of the legislation and cannot be used as an example. We cannot bear this extra tax. Moreover, the construction of houses varies, and the amount of rent varies. It is impossible to generalize. Moreover, the current situation is no different from before, and there is no reason to change the established practice arbitrarily. For this reason, we send this letter in the hope that you will look into the actual situation and handle it according to the established practice, collecting taxes according to the actual rent received, so as to conform to the facts and show fairness. After sending the letter, we received a reply stating that it would be submitted to the valuation committee for review, and that the old amount would be collected temporarily. If the review results require payment according to the new amount, the difference must be paid. We believe that regardless of the review results, we can only pay taxes according to the actual rent paid, and we cannot arbitrarily bear any extra taxes. We are afraid that the bureau may make a biased decision, leading to a bad precedent. For this reason, we send this official letter to your association, requesting that you uphold justice and handle the matter for the public good. Please refer to our previous letter and strictly comply. Thank you."</p>

<p>The Old and New Factory Owners Were Absent</p>
<p>Rescheduled for Mediation on the 28th</p>
<p>The sale of the Sanxin Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road has attracted considerable attention from all walks of life. The Municipal Social Bureau was ordered to handle the matter and summoned parties for questioning yesterday. The details of the situation are as follows:</p>

Xu Zhi, a member of the bureau, presided over the meeting and Zhu Gui Lin recorded the minutes. The questioning was very detailed regarding the details of this incident.</p>
<p>Notice to Labor Sheng: Because Rong Zongjing, the buyer of the machinery and factory buildings, and Sheng Ze Cheng, the owner of the Sanxin factory, did not come to the bureau for questioning yesterday, which was deemed inappropriate, the Municipal Social Bureau specially rescheduled the questioning for 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 28th of this month and will mediate the matter at the same time. A notice was published in the newspaper informing Rong Zongjing and Sheng Ze Cheng, the interested parties in the case, to personally or send a responsible representative to the bureau on time to listen to the mediation and not to delay in order to avoid unexpected incidents.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance's Unified Tax Department replied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday regarding the request of the cotton cloth industry to change the method of issuing unified tax licenses. The letter stated that since the implementation of the unified tax, there have been difficulties. The letter stated: "We have received your chamber of commerce's official letter, stating that you have received a letter from the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry Association, stating that since the implementation of the unified tax, they have encountered difficulties. According to the points pointed out, we have forwarded them for separate handling. We have investigated and found that at the beginning of the implementation of the unified tax, all the regulations may not have been perfect. We are very grateful for the instructions. However, we have investigated and found that the points pointed out in the current letter have been directly discussed with the various yarn and cloth industry associations, etc., and have been approved, rejected, and reviewed separately, and resolved one by one. Our department believes that the promotion of the new tax should first facilitate business conditions. All the various associations, etc., may directly negotiate with our department at any time through their representatives, either orally or in writing, if they have any doubts about the unified tax method or have any requests. We will discuss and resolve them immediately. We have approved the letter and should reply to your chamber of commerce for your reference and also ask you to inform them."</p>

<h3 id="e131">Silk Factories Telegraph Urgently to Issue Public Bonds <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Shen Huaichen and other chairman and members of the Silk Factory Associations in Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Shanghai telegraphed the National Government yesterday, saying: "To the Nanjing National Government Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry, we humbly submit that the silk factories in Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Shanghai have requested the issuance of silk industry public bonds because they are not sufficient for relief, and we earnestly request that the bond amount be increased and the regulations revised. Representatives have been dispatched to the ministries one after another to petition, and a written application was submitted on the 13th of this month, and we were grateful for your approval. The Spring Equinox has passed, and the silkworm rearing season is approaching. Most silk factories are unable to clear the old cocoon mortgages and have stopped operating. The silver and money industry is naturally unwilling to continue to provide advances in view of this situation. The rumors are spreading, and farmers are afraid that silkworm rearing will not be profitable and are all waiting and watching. This not only affects the livelihoods of ordinary people and social finance, but also whether rural farmers can enthusiastically rear silkworms without profits, whether cocoon sales are smooth, whether factories can continue to operate, and whether foreign trade can be maintained all depend on the early or late issuance of these public bonds, which is a matter of great importance. Therefore, we do not mind disturbing you and urgently send this telegram again. We humbly request that your ministries take into consideration the situation and quickly forward our previous report to the Executive Yuan for investigation and approval for immediate issuance to maintain the precarious situation. We humbly await your urgent command. Committee of the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association, Committee of the Wuxi County Silk Factory Industry Association, Preparatory Committee of the Zhejiang Silk Factory Federation."</p>

<p>Yu Hede, the chairman of the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange Co., Ltd., submitted a report to the Executive Yuan stating that the term of establishment is about to expire and requesting approval for a ten-year extension.

It has been found that the business types of the company are the same as those of other exchanges in the same area. The requested extension of the term should be handled after the merger of the various exchanges of the same type of business. Before the merger, it is approved to temporarily continue operations.</p>

Now that he has been recommended by his fellow countrymen, he will naturally do his best to serve.</p>

<p>Resolution Passed by the Municipal Executive Committee Yesterday</p>
<p>The Organization Department of the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters, based on previous reports from the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Eleventh Sub-branches of the Ninth District, stated that the Ninth District was too vast and requested to be divided into two districts to facilitate party affairs. After review, it was deemed feasible. Therefore, it was proposed to establish the Ninth District (i.e., the Caojing, Fahua, and Qibao District) Party Headquarters from the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, and Eighty-first Sub-branches and the Second Directly Subordinate Sub-branch, originally belonging to the Ninth District. The Tenth, Twelfth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Sub-branches, originally belonging to the Ninth District, would be established as the Tenth District (i.e., the Pusan District) Party Headquarters. Furthermore, it was proposed to appoint Comrades Chen Zhen, Wang Yonggong, and Hou Junren as members of the preparatory committee for the Tenth District Party Headquarters, submitting the proposal to the Municipal Executive Committee for public decision and implementation. It is now known that this proposal was passed at the ninety-seventh regular meeting of the Municipal Executive Committee yesterday, and the orders appointing Chen Zhen and the other two have already been issued.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Shanghai Shipping Merchants Safeguard Passenger Safety <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Continued Request for Troops to Escort Ships</p>
<p>Ever since the Jiangshun Wheel of the China Merchants Bureau experienced the tragic incident of demobilized soldiers and gambling bandits murdering the ship's cook, the Bureau has petitioned the Capital Garrison Headquarters to dispatch military police to be stationed on the ship for protection. The Garrison Headquarters approved this request, stating that the dispatch of military police to the ships should be beyond question. Upon receiving this approval, the various shipping bureaus felt quite uneasy and publicly requested the Shipping Association to telegraph the commander-in-chief and deputy commander again, urging them to quickly dispatch troop detachments to be stationed on the ships to reassure passengers. The China Merchants Bureau also continued to petition the headquarters, recounting the harm caused by gambling bandits on Yangtze River ships, who often commit violence and injure people, causing passengers to fear travel. In contrast, foreign merchants' Yangtze River ships have naval protection, leading to thriving businesses and profits tripled. However, state-run Yangtze River ships, even when requesting troop escort for personnel safety, are not granted permission. It is as if seeking to revitalize the shipping industry and reclaim shipping rights is like climbing a tree to catch a fish. It should be requested that the Garrison Headquarters dispatch special service team soldiers to be stationed on Yangtze River ships to protect passengers. If the Garrison Headquarters has difficulties, then please issue a general order to the garrisons at all ports along the Yangtze River, instructing them to dispatch a platoon of soldiers to the docks to provide protection when Chinese merchant Yangtze River ships arrive at the port. In this way, passengers can be guaranteed safety, and bandits can be deterred, and the shipping industry can have hope of flourishing.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Luggage Carrying Service</p>
<p>There are many gangsters in the Shanghai Pudong area, with so-called thirty-six gangs, specializing in forcibly carrying passengers' luggage at various docks, extorting money. If one is not careful, their luggage is snatched away. The hotel industry in Shanghai has already reported this matter to the Public Security Bureau for investigation and prohibition. Recently, such incidents still occur from time to time. Tang Shaoda and others in Nanshi, who specialize in purchasing tickets and transporting passengers on behalf of customers, have raised funds to organize a luggage carrying service for passengers traveling on various Yangtze River and coastal ships, starting from the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau, to prevent passengers from being forcibly robbed and extorted by gangsters. Tang and others have submitted a report to the China Merchants Bureau, requesting permission to undertake this service. The Bureau has investigated and confirmed that this will benefit both the shipping bureau and the passengers, and has approved it, requiring Tang and others to pay a deposit of six thousand yuan and conduct a trial for three months. If successful, a contract will be formally signed.</p>

<p>New Addition of Companies</p>
<p>With the increasing number of ships traveling the Sino-American route, the American Max Wheel Company has recently decided to open a new route in Shanghai, from Shanghai across the Pacific Ocean to New York. They have specially prepared ten newly built 10,000-ton giant ships with motor engines to operate in China. The first ship, the Neil Max, is scheduled to make its maiden voyage on May 8. After arriving in Shanghai, one ship will be dispatched to Shanghai every month, specializing in carrying passengers and cargo. The American Mostoshi Yoko company is fully authorized to act as its agent in Shanghai.</p>
<p>New York Express Route</p>
<p>The New York express route newly opened by Dale Yangxing Shipping Company is scheduled to begin operations on April 3. Ships traveling from Shanghai to San Francisco will take the Panama Canal to New York, requiring only thirty-six days, one day faster than the fastest Sino-American ships in Shanghai. After the announcement of this new route, customers have been very enthusiastic about booking export cargo, as it is a regular mail ship and the water freight can avoid the huge cost of the Japanese railway transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Shanghai Shipping Merchants Conference on Tea Room Issues <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>British Merchants Advocate for Direct Employment</p>
<p>Ever since the tragic incident of the struggle between new and old tea room staff on the Gonghe Wheel, Jardine Matheson has advocated that the tea room staff on river ships should be directly employed by the company, not belonging to the compradors. After many discussions, it could not be realized due to the union's disapproval. Now, after the tea room disputes on the Yangtze River Anqing Wheel, Taikoo Company is also considering directly employing the tea room staff on each ship and paying them salaries, abolishing the old system of relying solely on tips for living expenses, in order to eliminate future disputes. This matter is currently under negotiation.</p>
<p>Chinese Ship Discussion of Measures</p>
<p>The tea room disputes within various Chinese ships in this port have been reported to the Shipping Association, which submitted them to the executive committee for discussion of fundamental solutions. It was decided to submit a request to the central government for approval. Yesterday, the association sent a letter to the various shipping bureaus to investigate the facts of tea room disputes on Yangtze River and coastal ships, in order to compile and submit them to the government. The original letter briefly stated that the twelfth executive committee meeting had made a temporary proposal regarding the ship tea room, which often causes incidents, and a case was made for how to properly discuss measures. The decision was made to fully describe the process and telegraph the central party headquarters and the Executive Yuan of the National Government to request instructions on measures. Since this is on record, it should be handled accordingly and is currently being drafted. However, considering that this matter concerns a petition, it is necessary to list all the facts in detail to achieve the desired effect. However, although this association has repeatedly heard and known something about the behavior of tea room staff on various ships, it is difficult to know the details. Therefore, we hereby write to your company, requesting that you list in detail all the past irregularities of tea room staff on various Yangtze River and coastal ships, the poor system of the Shanghai-Ningbo tea room workers' union, and the various sufferings and facts of relying on the power of the union to encroach on public affairs and increase the burden on passengers, as well as the handling methods that should be banned, and send them to the association by the deadline, so that they can be forwarded accordingly. This matter concerns vital interests and long-standing entanglements. To seek a thorough solution, it is necessary to first cite the facts and attach the proposed measures, in order to be convincing and hope to be approved. We await your reply with a brush, hoping that you will reply quickly and not delay. This is what we hope for.</p>

<p>Seven Buses Purchased</p>
<p>Operations Begin on May 1</p>
<p>The area between Shanghai and Songjiang has recently become densely populated with thriving commerce and an increasing number of travelers. In terms of transportation, in addition to the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway passing through the area, there are no other vehicles to connect the two places, making it inconvenient for merchants to travel back and forth. Recently, a merchant named Yin Shisheng has been preparing to open a long-distance bus route between Songjiang and Shanghai, starting from Beiqiao Town in Shanghai, passing through more than ten stations such as Maqiao and Huiqiao, and ending in Songjiang. He has submitted a request to the Shanghai County Construction Bureau, which forwarded it to the Construction Department for approval and filing, and requested that the uneven road surfaces in the areas passed through by Beiqiao and other places be slightly repaired to facilitate driving. After investigating the situation, the Bureau believed that operating long-distance buses would benefit the local citizens and the future development of commerce and immediately approved the request, and drafted operating regulations to achieve perfection. It is now reported that the merchant has purchased seven public buses, and the station buildings in Songjiang and Shanghai are also under construction and will be completed soon. It is scheduled to officially operate on May 1 of this year.</p>

<p>Resolved to Continue Remitting 15,000 Yuan</p>
<p>To Help with the Spring Famine in Shaanxi Province</p>
<p>The disaster situation in Shaanxi Province is becoming increasingly serious. The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association first received a personal request for relief from Kang Jiyao, the chairman of the Xi'an Chinese and Foreign Relief Association. Now, they have received an urgent telegram from Mr. Russell, a director of the Shaanxi Association, and a report from Mr. Zhang Junxianqing, a director returning to Shanghai from Shaanxi. They all said in unison that in this period between the old and new harvests, within the next two months, if relief funds are not raised generously, it is feared that eight million disaster victims will become starving corpses. This shows the urgency of the need for relief, which brooks no delay. A board meeting was specially convened yesterday, chaired by Mr. Song Hanzhang. All the Chinese and Western directors present regarded it as important and decided that, in addition to the 20,000 yuan already allocated, they would raise another 15,000 yuan and telegraph it to the Xi'an Chinese and Foreign Relief Association to provide relief for the spring famine. However, in Shaanxi Province, not only do the living need rescue, but corpses are also scattered everywhere, urgently awaiting burial. Moreover, both emergency and long-term relief require a large amount of relief funds. It is felt that this small amount is of no help and they are actively seeking more assistance from all walks of life to alleviate this great calamity.</p>

<p>Previously, Mr. Zhu Ziqiao passed through Shanghai for the Shaanxi disaster relief efforts, repeatedly contacted the Chinese Red Cross Society, and subsidized medicines. However, there were more than 2,000 disaster children in the area, and it was feared that smallpox would prevail, threatening their lives. The Chinese Red Cross Society felt compassion and believed that for a fundamental solution, it was necessary to vaccinate them with cowpox as soon as possible. Mr. Wang Peiyuan and Mr. Wang Zhenchuan of the association requested the Municipal Health Bureau Director Hu to allocate cowpox vaccine. It is reported that yesterday, Director Hu provided the association with two large jars of cowpox vaccine, sufficient for vaccinating 2,000 disaster children. The association will also transport the solicited vaccination equipment to Shaanxi for use.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Provisional Relief Association for the Shaanxi Disaster received two telegrams from Mr. Zhu Ziqiao yesterday, urging the remittance of relief funds. They are recorded as follows: (1) To the benevolent leaders of the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association, the Shaanxi disaster relief has been possible due to your rallying call and the enthusiastic assistance of philanthropists from all walks of life in Shanghai. I am deeply grateful. However, at this time between the old and new harvests, the living are waiting to have their lives extended, and the dead are waiting to be buried. Every additional relief fund reduces the suffering of the disaster victims by one point. I have telegraphed my colleagues in Shaanxi to provide relief as soon as possible. Lan will return to Shanghai after the construction materials for the project are transported to Shaanxi. Qing you, (2) To the benevolent elder Xie Chuochuang, I trust that your health has recovered soon. Thank you for your vigorous promotion of the Shaanxi disaster relief. I am deeply impressed. At this time of urgent spring relief, the arrival of relief funds one day earlier will reduce the suffering of the disaster victims by one day. Mr. and Mrs. Ha Junxian are concerned about relief, and I also thank the benevolent elders for appealing to the disaster victims on their behalf. I am sure that you have already shown benevolence.

<p>Mitsubishi Fails to Deliver Goods According to Contract</p>
<p>Undermining the Credit of Warehouse Receipts in the Business Community</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Shanghai yesterday, which reads: "We are writing to inform you that on March 25, we received a letter from the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association stating that our member, Yuan Sheng Sugar Firm, reported that Mitsubishi Company had issued 27 warehouse receipts for 1,200 bags of YP ink and 100 bags of YS ink of Dong Sugar. However, when they went to the warehouse to collect the sugar, Mitsubishi suddenly disregarded its credibility and stopped payment to the warehouse, causing the sugar to fail to be collected. We requested you to negotiate. Our chamber sent a letter to Mitsubishi on the 15th of this month to question them, but a week has passed and we have not received a reply. This shows that the company is clearly in the wrong and has secrets that are difficult to answer, so it simply ignores it. In this situation, we should immediately file a complaint with the Japanese consulate for recovery. However, considering that Mitsubishi Company is also a giant among Japanese merchants in Shanghai, in order to avoid excessive emotional harm and uphold the principle of peaceful resolution, we hereby submit the facts and attach a copy of the original letter to Mitsubishi for your review. We also request that you write to the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Shanghai and inform Mitsubishi Company to prioritize credibility and promptly cancel the improper stop-payment action, so that Yuan Sheng can collect the sugar and maintain the long-standing credibility of warehouse receipts. If Mitsubishi still fabricates facts and attempts to conceal its mistakes, and fails to comply, then we request that your chamber, together with the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, order the two parties to come to the meeting to state their reasons and provide mediation or arbitration to avoid litigation and resolve the dispute." A copy of the letter to Mitsubishi was attached. Based on this, the sugar was paid for and the relevant warehouse receipts were issued, and the bills of exchange were also obtained. With the procedures completed, the goods should be delivered according to the receipts. Now, it is reported that Mitsubishi Company has stopped the payment without any reasonable statement, making the warehouse receipts, which have long been credible in Shanghai's commercial community, lose their effect at once, opening up future disputes in the business community and destroying the good habits of past transactions. Mitsubishi Company has been doing business in Shanghai for many years and should not want to break this precedent. We should therefore copy the letter to your office and ask you to inform Mitsubishi Company to deliver the goods according to the receipts to maintain commercial credit and public relations. We also have local news transferred to the back page."</p>

<p>The weather in this port was very warm for the past few days, no different from May or June. It was even worse the day before yesterday. The temperature on the Fahrenheit thermometer rose to 86 degrees. Pedestrians on the road were all wearing single layers. After nightfall, the north wind was fierce and became increasingly strong. Waking up in the morning, the cold wind felt bone-chilling, and cotton clothing was not enough to keep warm, causing a feeling of shrinking. At around 11 a.m., there was a brief rain shower. The wind was even stronger in the afternoon, resembling the weather of severe winter. The weather differed by about four or five months in two days.</p>

<p>Appointment to Meet at the Great World</p>
<p>Arrested on Xizang Road</p>
<p>Lin Mengcai, a native of Ningbo, lives at No. 105 Zha Pu Road and works as a clerk at Yuchang Coal Company on Aido Road. Since July 28 of last year, he has successively received eight threatening letters, extorting 30,000 yuan. Lin ignored them because he did not have the financial resources. The last letter was delivered on the 23rd of this month, ordering him to go to the Republican Hall of the Great World at 2 p.m. that day to negotiate. The person going would hold an umbrella and a shoe box as a sign. If he still ignored them, there would be consequences. Lin then sent all the letters to the Hongkou Police Station for investigation. The police sent several detectives to wait in the Republican Hall. Lin also sent Chen Zufeng to hold an umbrella and a box. Waiting until four o'clock, a person wandered alone in the hall but did not dare to talk to Chen. The detectives secretly instructed Chen to go outside to observe his actions. Chen then left, and the person followed him. The detectives also followed behind. When they reached the vicinity of the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road, the person asked Chen to stop and inquired about something. The detectives immediately surrounded and arrested him before he could speak, and took him to the police station. Under questioning, it was learned that he was a native of Nanjing, named Zeng Jinshou. They then went to Dongyouheng Road, Seward Road, Kunming Road, and Shanbei and other places to arrest his accomplices Rong Jinsheng, Huang Linsheng, Rong He氏, Chen Minghe, Liang Lao四, etc., seizing three handguns, two fake handguns, and eighty-nine bullets. Except for Liang Shangji, who was detained at the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, the remaining people were escorted to the Special District Court yesterday along with the guns and bullets, where they were interrogated by Judge Xiao. The plaintiff, Lin Mengcai, had returned to his hometown, so he did not appear in court. Among the defendants, Chen Minghe was Lin's brother-in-law. According to the police investigation, this case was purely initiated by Chen. Cao, Rong, Huang, etc., all claimed that they were helping others. All the threatening letters were written by a Qin surname who was on the run, and the guns and bullets belonged to Chen A'da. The court ordered the defendants to be returned to custody separately and adjourned the hearing for further investigation.</p>

<p>Seeks Alimony Compensation</p>
<p>Husband Previously Divorced Twice</p>
<p>Feng Fengzhu, a native of Guangdong, is 41 years old and teaches in Shanghai. On August 24 of the seventeenth year of the Republic, he married Tan Mei, a woman from Xiangshan, as his wife. Tan is currently 23 years old. The couple's relationship has recently deteriorated. Tan decided to divorce him due to her unsuitability for marriage. She first submitted a request to the Special District District Court for mediation. This Monday, the Civil Court President Ying Shi convened both parties for mediation. As a result, their opinions could not be reconciled, and persuasion was ineffective. Tan Mei then retained lawyer Wu Shaoshan to file a formal lawsuit. Her complaint briefly stated that she was seeking a divorce and claiming for alimony due to her inability to live together and her experience of abuse. It stated that on August 24 of the seventeenth year of the Republic, she married Feng Fengzhu after being introduced by a matchmaker named Lu. At that time, both parties belonged to old-fashioned families, so the husband's character was entirely based on the matchmaker's flowery words, creating a castle in the air. The plaintiff's parents were honest and deeply believed it to be true, thinking that Feng Fengzhu was a scholarly son and his character must be extraordinary, celebrating that their beloved daughter had married a dragon and would not have to worry about her son-in-law in the future. The plaintiff was a weak woman in the boudoir who did not understand worldly affairs. Bound by etiquette, she could not consider it in detail. Unexpectedly, a moment of misjudgment led to eternal regret. After entering the door, she learned that Feng Fengzhu was tyrannical by nature, and his actions were vulgar and difficult to describe. It was difficult to harmonize the zither and the se. Occasionally, if there was a disagreement, he would shout and scold, and even use physical violence, leaving scars on her skin. The plaintiff had been taught from an early age to know both books and etiquette. Seeing that her husband's actions were rebellious and tyrannical, and his various behaviors were unbearable, she attempted suicide three times but was unsuccessful. (Omission) Investigation revealed that Feng Fengzhu had been married twice before and had divorced each time. His personality and behavior were self-evident. He became even more extreme and incited his sixteen-year-old son from his previous marriage, Feng Shaoliang, to abuse and insult the plaintiff in every way, which cannot be described. Whenever the plaintiff argued with him, her mother-in-law, Zhu, would assist him in his evil deeds and cut off her food and clothing. The plaintiff gave birth to a child the year after her marriage, and the expenses for raising the child to this day have been borrowed from her mother's family, allowing her to survive meagerly. Feng Fengzhu has never contributed a word of advice. On December 7 of last year, Feng beat the plaintiff severely again for a trivial matter, causing serious injuries. The plaintiff returned to Ning to recuperate. The mother-in-law took the opportunity to file a false accusation with the local court, accusing the plaintiff's mother of abducting her, but the court found the accusation to be baseless and dismissed the case. Based on the above facts, Feng Fengzhu, as the plaintiff's husband, failed to support his wife and children and colluded with his mother and son to devise poisonous plans to trample on women. There could be nothing more extreme. The relationship between husband and wife was completely broken, and it was inevitable that she would request the court to grant a divorce from Feng Fengzhu. The plaintiff's son is only three years old and should be raised by the plaintiff according to reason. She also requests that the defendant be ordered to pay alimony after the divorce, calculated at ten yuan per month until the plaintiff is sixty years old, totaling 22,200 yuan. The court accepted the complaint and immediately notified the defendant to submit a defense within the statutory period, pending scheduling of a hearing.</p>

A copy of the order was forwarded.</p>
<p>Director Pan's Remarks: A reporter from the New Sound News visited Director Pan Gongzhan of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday and inquired about the Gaochang Temple tram case. The conversation is recorded as follows: (Q) How is the conflict between the Chinese tram workers and the naval aviation drivers being handled? (A) This bureau has received instructions from the Municipal Government to investigate thoroughly with the Public Security and Public Works Bureaus and will report the findings to the Municipal Government for review. Now, we have received instructions from the Municipal Government, which has forwarded a letter to the Naval First Fleet Command, severely punishing drivers such as Zhang Likang, who refused to purchase tickets and caused the incident. The Garrison Command has also been requested to reiterate the previous order to strictly prohibit fare evasion, and the Public Security Bureau has been ordered to effectively protect trams passing along that route in order to maintain traffic. (Q) It is rumored that Chinese tram workers will have a second strike because the murderer has not been caught. Has your bureau heard of this? (A) We have not heard of it yet. However, the government has properly planned post-incident management, and we believe that the union members will not take any further excessive actions. If it is confirmed that a small number of troublemakers are taking the opportunity to incite unrest, they will be strictly investigated and dealt with.</p>

<p>One Million Yuan in Funding Fully Subscribed</p>

Recently, Huacheng Tobacco Company, in conjunction with all local businesses in the industry, initiated the organization of the China Tobacco Leaf Company, raising one million yuan to purchase and cure domestically produced tobacco leaf. A curing factory will first be established in Qingdao, with substantial capital and a large scale, sufficient to compete with foreign merchants, reclaim rights and interests, and ensure success. Yesterday, the founders' meeting was held at the Huacheng Tobacco Company on Ningbo Road. Stock subscriptions were enthusiastically made on the spot, and the full amount has already been subscribed. Shen Xingde, Shen Dehua, Zhang Boyi, Chen Maonan, and Zhang Songnan have been appointed as preparatory members to actively proceed with the project.</p>

<p>Liu Xieyu, a student from Hunan Province at the Construction University, was previously suspected of being an accomplice of Liu Hongdong and Bao Zi, two reactionary elements apprehended by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He was detained and sent to the Special District Local Court, which ordered him to be held pending the presentation of Liu and Bao for questioning. As reported previously, yesterday morning, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent officers to escort the two to the court. Judge Feng Shide reopened the trial. The lawyer of the constabulary, Li Zhishan, stated that the constabulary had now discovered that Liu Xieyu had previously been sentenced to four months for a reactionary crime and that he was indeed an accomplice of Liu Hongdong and others.

<p>Yesterday at 2:00 PM, an elderly woman, approximately 50 years old, wearing a blue woolen hat and blue cloth clothing, was walking along the Songhu Railway tracks in front of the Parker Milk Company on Jiangwan Road. A small train returning to Shanghai from Songhu was speeding by, and the woman was unable to avoid it, resulting in her entire body being caught under the train. Her brains splattered, and her legs were severed. Her head was completely crushed, a gruesome sight. As of 6:00 PM, no family members had come to claim the body. The railway authorities, due to the lack of family identification, ordered railway workers to temporarily place the woman's body aside, covered with reed mats, to await family members to claim it.</p>

<p>Ni Wangshi, an elderly woman from Suzhou, 73 years old, in good spirits, resided at No. 3 1/2, Maurice Street. Yesterday evening at around 7:00 PM, she hired a carriage to visit a sick child at the Qi family on Fuxu Road. She was warmly welcomed upstairs by the hostess, and they chatted happily. Unexpectedly, misfortune struck. At 8:30 PM, she bid farewell and went downstairs. Inadvertently, she slipped on the stairs and fell, suffering severe head and nose injuries. She died shortly after. Her relatives transported the body to Bao Long Hospital and then to the autopsy center, awaiting notification to the court for examination.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Apprentice Dies, Family Unaware <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>His Mother Has Filed a Complaint</p>
<p>Shen Yinshi, from Haimen, accompanied by witness Shen Guanxing, brought Cao Tangjin to the Second Precinct of the Third District, accusing him of the following: her son, Shen Lincai, 21 years old, was introduced by Shen Guanxing to work as an apprentice in the defendant's rope shop at the age of fifteen. Six years have passed, and he has not yet completed his apprenticeship. In the past, she had taken her son home to stay several times, but Cao, relying on the condition that he had not completed his apprenticeship, did not allow him freedom. The plaintiff was helpless. Now, after six years of apprenticeship and having become an adult, the plaintiff had arranged a marriage for her son in their hometown and needed him to return to meet his bride. Therefore, she rushed to Shanghai, but her son was nowhere to be found. When asked, the defendant claimed that he had gone out to work and would bring him back in about three days. The original intermediary was present at the time. Now, upon going there, she was suddenly told that he had died, which clearly contradicted the previous statement. Her son must have been abused to death, and the body destroyed. She demanded an investigation. When questioned, Cao Tangjin stated that he runs a rope shop in Yangjing and that the apprentice Shen Lincai suffered from dropsy. On December 28th of last year, he was sent to Zhengxin Hospital in Yangshupu for treatment. He died on January 6th of this year. The hospital took the initiative to handle the funeral and buried him in a public cemetery. He had indeed died of illness. Witness Shen Guanxing testified that he runs a car dealership near the defendant's shop. Shen Lincai was the one he introduced to be an apprentice. He did not know if he had died, but the defendant had not notified him. Because Shen Yinshi wanted to ask him for her son, he had no choice but to bring the defendant to the case and request an investigation. The precinct chief, considering that the case involved a life, and a future exhumation would be necessary, immediately transferred it to the local court for thorough investigation.</p>

<p>A Jiangbei boat was docked at the East China Sea port in Wusong. Yesterday afternoon at around 1:00 PM, all the men and women on the boat went ashore to shop, leaving only three children to guard the boat. All the children were around ten years old. Subsequently, the three children were playing with fire in the boat, causing a fire to break out on the canvas awning. At that time, the sea breeze was very strong, and the entire boat caught fire in an instant. Residents on the shore noticed and tried to extinguish the fire, only to find that the three children had been burned, their heads and faces charred, their abdomens ruptured, and their intestines spilled out, a gruesome sight. By the time the family members returned from shopping, they had lost their homes and loved ones, and they cried inconsolably by the river.</p>

<p>Ge, the father of the wife of Xu Delang, the young owner of the Huaxing Biscuit Shop at Wangjia Wharf in the South City, filed a petition seeking justice for his daughter's tragic death. His daughter, Mrs. Xu Delang nee Ge, committed suicide by taking poison due to unbearable abuse. The sixteenth patrol precinct reported this to the local court, which sent personnel to verify that she had indeed died from poisoning. The First Precinct of the First District detained Xu Delang and sent him to the Public Security Bureau for questioning and detention pending instructions. Now, Ge Chengrong, the father of the deceased, feeling deeply aggrieved by his daughter's untimely death, hired someone to draft a petition and submitted it to the local court yesterday, seeking justice. The court instructed him to await summons.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Female Kidnapper Sentenced to Two Years of Imprisonment <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xiaomao, the three-year-old son of Zhang Qifeng, residing at No. 22 Mill Street in the French Concession, was lured away by the kidnapper Zhang Yushi, in collusion with her lover Zhu Awu, on December 11th of last year. They entrusted the elderly woman Chen Wangshi to sell the child to Zhou Zhangshi in Gaochang Temple. Zhang then took the child to Fujian Province. Detective Liu Youfa of the French police discovered this and apprehended Zhang Yushi, her lover Zhu Awu, and the elderly woman Chen Wangshi. However, the child had already been taken far away to Fujian and could not be brought to court. Yesterday, the police escorted the defendants to the French court for investigation. The plaintiff, Zhang Qifeng, first described the kidnapping, stating that two children had been kidnapped at the time, one eight years old and one three years old. The eight-year-old child cried on the road and was abandoned along the way, and the police department sent him back. The three-year-old child was then sold. He was grateful that they had been apprehended and requested a severe punishment. When questioned, Zhang Yushi confessed that Zhang Laohu, who was at large, had instigated the woman to kidnap the child, and she received 100 yuan for the sale, of which the woman used 30 yuan. Zhu Awu admitted to being in a relationship with Yushi, but the child was kidnapped and sold by Yushi. Although he used 30 yuan from the money afterwards, he did not participate in the kidnapping. His remaining statements were evasive. Chen Wangshi stated that Zhu Awu brought the child to her and entrusted her to sell him to Zhou Zhangshi in Gaochang Temple for 100 yuan. The woman received 10 yuan. When he was brought to her, they falsely claimed that the child's father was dead and that they were unable to raise him, so they were selling him. She did not know he had been kidnapped and asked for leniency. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Zhang Yushi to two years of imprisonment in a female prison, Zhu Awu to eight months of imprisonment, and Chen Wangshi to four months of imprisonment. The detention period before the verdict was pronounced was allowed to be deducted.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Telegram of Request for Relief from Ba County <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society recently received a telegram from Feng Junyi and others, chairman of the Ba County Temporary Relief Committee, reporting on the severe disaster situation and the establishment of a temporary relief committee. It is hereby disclosed as follows: "Our county is unfortunate, and disasters occur repeatedly. Last year, the weather was unfavorable, with spring floods and summer droughts, resulting in poor harvests and empty granaries. The wealthy have become poor, and the poor have become starving refugees. Throughout the county, there is nothing but devastation. News has spread far and wide, causing widespread grief. The vitality of the people has not yet recovered, and for the past hundred days, there has been no rain, water sources have dried up, and the land is cracked. In addition, our county has a dense population and does not produce much rice. The majority of our food relies on supplies from neighboring counties. In recent months, various places have successively prohibited supplies, resulting in a complete cutoff. Rice prices have soared, costing a hundred or a thousand coins per dou, and there is no market available. As a result, there are cries of distress everywhere, with people waiting to be fed. The phenomenon of refugees fleeing is unprecedented. We believe that the people are the foundation of the nation and food is the people's heaven. Now, it is still far from the new harvest, and the lives of the people in our county are on the verge of collapse. If there is a shortage of food before the new harvest, the tragedy will be even worse. Considering the future, we cannot help but be alarmed. Therefore, on the true date of March, we gathered representatives from various institutions, organizations, and all sectors of the county to establish the Ba County Temporary Relief Committee General Assembly at the county government. We also decided to establish branches and offices in various districts, townships, and towns in the county to actively raise money and materials to relieve the poor. However, our strength is limited, and our knowledge is insufficient. In the face of this difficult task, we are unable to cope. We believe that people from all walks of life are deeply concerned and have a compassion for all people. We hope that you will offer suggestions for disaster relief and generously contribute funds to help the poor so that hundreds of thousands of our suffering compatriots will not be forced to flee and can celebrate a new life. Our gratitude will not be limited to our committee. We are writing this telegram in distress, eager to receive your instructions. Feng Junyi and others of the Ba County Temporary Relief Committee bow."</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Epidemic Prevention Hospital at the North Harbor Mouth on the opposite side of Zhang Huabang in Wusong was established during the late Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. It was originally under the jurisdiction of the customs authorities. Later, it was divided into Chinese and foreign sections. The total area of the land is over fifty mu. There was always surplus land outside the hospital, with trees planted around the perimeter and ditches dug as a boundary to isolate it from the local people and prevent the spread of infection. Last year, the National Government sent Wu Liande to take over the jurisdiction of quarantine at seaports throughout the country. The hospital was also simultaneously taken back. Since its establishment, the hospital has occupied a significant position in the country. Unexpectedly, someone paid 57 yuan to the abolished Shangbao Sand Field Bureau and obtained a permit for 9.5 mu of land. When the resident officers and police discovered this, they reported it to Director Wu Liande for handling. Yesterday, Director Wu, accompanied by Secretary Ni Mingshan, and medical officers, went to inspect the site. After observing the terrain, they found that the person who obtained the permit was clearly acting with corrupt motives, intending to encroach on the land and disrupt epidemic prevention. In addition to Secretary Ni consulting the land bureau and the dredging bureau to review the files, they plan to take strict measures to crack down on the illegal occupation.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of the Public Works Department estimating rent and collecting municipal general tax, the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Association, in addition to sending a letter to the department to issue a warning, also sent a letter yesterday to the Five Chinese Directors, asking them to argue for reason, stating that the Public Works Department's move is clearly an abuse of tax rates and will increase taxes. The citizens will certainly not recognize this. Whether this case has been submitted to the board of directors for approval, and whether the various Chinese associations will strongly oppose the proposal at the meeting, the citizens' belief in the directors is sincere and unwavering. This association, on behalf of all citizens of the district, asks them to strongly argue with the Public Works Department and insist to the end to achieve the goal of cancellation, which will benefit the citizens. This letter was sent out yesterday.</p>

<p>The Daji ship was burned for more than ten days, and most of the victims were farmers, merchants, and poor laborers from Taizhou, Jiangdu, Dongtai, and Haimen in Jiangbei. Many families have lost their support due to this tragedy. According to a visitor from Zhanghuang Port yesterday, the tragic situation of the family members receiving aid at the port is difficult to describe. As of the day before yesterday (24th), a total of sixty coffins had been transported by Dada and other ships from the port to the original hometowns of the families in Taiyang. Seven coffins were previously transported from Shanghai to Jiangbei. The family members and deceased who reported to the authorities in Shanghai in the past two days are recorded as follows: Reporter, Origin, Deceased: Sun Fengshan, Taizhou, Son Shu Yun; Hu Tianling, Yangzhou, Son Ertiao; Yu Xueqing, Sishui, Daughter Su Zhen; Yao Yunshan, Haimen, Son Yuanxing; Yuan Shilin, Haimen, Younger Brother Cailang; Shao Pinqi, Haimen, Nephew Zemin; Zhang Chulang, Haimen, Younger Brother Yongxing; Friend Chen Jiulin; Lu Guoxiang, Yancheng, Younger Sister Hengxiu; Han Deming, Yangzhou Xiannv Temple, Younger Brother Youwu; Hua Changgeng, Taizhou, Nephew Yang Er; Li Zhaokun, Yangzhou, Cousin Pan Yongchang; Jiang Chenglin, Gaoyou, Younger Sister Guo Jiangshi; Jiang Shouchou, Dongtai, Father Jinlin; Tan Fucheng, Dongtai, Nephew Gao Longfa; Wang Futang, Anhui, Brother-in-law Lü Tianshen; Chen, Haimen, Son Songting; Liu Furong, Haimen, Nephew Chen Delong; Wang Caigen, Zhenhai, Older Brother Qingeng.</p>

<p>The Seamen's Union sent a telegram to the Central Government, stating: "To the Nanjing Central Training Department, National Government, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Transportation, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs: We have received a report from Ling Hong and others, workers affected by the Yangtze River ship disaster of the French Lacheng Company, stating that at 2:05 PM on the 16th of this month, the ship encountered dense fog near the Beiyu Mountain Lighthouse in Zhejiang Province and struck a reef, causing the ship's bow to rupture. The captain sounded the bell and ordered the engine room to reverse the engines. Within just twenty minutes, the ship sank. Previously, Ling Hong, the second comprador, twice personally asked the captain to send a radio distress call, but he refused to do so and did not allow anyone to escape. As a result, the victims had no choice but to jump into the water and escape, in a state of extreme panic. It is estimated that eleven crew members, two female passengers and maids from the grand dining room, and one female passenger from the second class cabin drowned. All their belongings were lost. The captain of the ship was rescued by staff members and taken to the nearby mountainside, where they gathered grass and wood to light a fire to keep warm. At midnight on the 17th, a merchant ship passed by, and they asked the lighthouse to send a telegram. On the morning of the 18th, they saw the French warship Mali arrive to rescue them. On the morning of the 19th, they returned to Shanghai by warship and demanded that the Lacheng Company compensate them for their losses in advance, but the company only agreed to give each person 15 yuan. There are currently over fifty crew members staying at the French police station on Feifei Road, which is temporarily providing food. The company uses the Haifang General Office as an excuse and refuses to take any action or provide any assistance. Please provide strong assistance. According to the report, the captain did not send a telegram or reverse the engines, causing the ship to sink and many lives to be lost. According to the law, he deserves punishment. The losses of the surviving workers are enormous, and the deceased are冤沉 under the sea. The company's improper employment makes it fully responsible for compensation and condolences. However, after our association sent personnel to negotiate, the company ignored it. We are therefore sending this telegram to your departments, requesting that you forward it to the Shanghai Municipal Government for assistance in handling the matter to save the affected workers. We await your instructions. The Chinese Seamen's Industrial Federation Organizing Committee, seal."</p>

As an accompanying condition, they will periodically convene representatives from both sides for further discussions. They are currently reorganizing the industry rules and are quite busy.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Prohibition of Superstitious Acts During Qingming Festival <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Proclamation by the Shanghai County Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a proclamation yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of a proclamation, according to the proposal of the Fifth District Chief at the Twelfth District Chief Meeting, during the Qingming Festival, villagers arbitrarily burn paper money and alcohol, engaging in superstitious activities, and requesting that a proclamation be issued to prohibit this in order to conserve people's wealth. After discussion, it was decided to investigate the matter. As this matter was previously proclaimed and ordered by the County Public Security Bureau and the District Chiefs to investigate and advise against it last year, we hereby issue a proclamation to all the people of the county, in addition to ordering the County Public Security Bureau and the District Chiefs, to make them fully aware that burning paper money is a superstitious custom, and if relatives visit each other, feasting with alcohol is even more meaningless. All must comply, mutually advise, and abolish these practices. It is imperative. This proclamation is hereby issued."</p>

<p>Zhang Shunhua, His Life Was Not Destined to End</p>
<p>Shunhua, a boy of fifteen, is from Ningbo. When he was five years old, his biological mother, due to poverty and difficult living conditions, had no choice but to sell Shunhua to a monk with the Dharma name Shichun as a disciple. He currently resides at No. 1 Gongqing Lane, Tangjia Lane, Tianbao Road, Zhabei. Shunhua is naturally dull, so he cannot remember the scriptures that Shichun teaches him to recite. Therefore, he does not please his master and is often whipped. Shunhua could not bear the hardship. The previous evening, the monk Shichun again ordered him to recite the scriptures, but he could not fulfill the request. As a result, he was once again punished and suffered greatly. Shunhua, overwhelmed with sadness, had the thought of committing suicide. Taking advantage of his master's unpreparedness, he secretly slipped out and went to the Youche Wharf, Puhui, in the South City, and jumped into the river. Before long, he surfaced. At that time, a coal boat was passing by. The boat owner, Mr. Hou, glimpsed a boy floating on the river and immediately went forward to rescue him. After rescuing Shunhua, he helped him to the side of the boat, warmed his body, and then used artificial respiration to revive him. After questioning him about the situation, he could not help but feel compassion for him. He quickly changed Shunhua's wet clothes and then let him stay overnight. Yesterday morning at about 8:00 AM, he reported the matter to Yin Wanyou, the guard of the Eighteenth Precinct, who took him to the relevant precinct of the First District. The precinct chief took the case and, after a preliminary interrogation, ordered him to prepare a document and send it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for placement.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Directors and Accountant of Jishengtang Accused <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Jishengtang in Zhejiang is a charitable organization organized by merchants from the eight counties of Jinhua, Zhejiang, in Shanghai. Cai Chunlin was elected as the standing director, Dong Tiaofu as the chairman, and Guo Baotao as the accountant. This time, Cai's term of office has expired, and as a result of clearing the accounts, Cai immediately hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against Dong and Guo, alleging embezzlement of 430 yuan under the guise of "longevity land rent," requesting an investigation. They were summoned, and the defendants stated that this matter should be asked of Director Ye Bao. Therefore, Ye was again summoned to the court for questioning and verification yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e176">The Treatment Method for Sensing External Pathogens <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Qin Bowei, a Chinese medicine doctor from Shangwen Road, Xiaoximen, this city, after publishing an article on the prediction of seasonal epidemics on the 5th of this month, indeed, almost no family could escape the prevalent influenza with symptoms of chills, fever, and cough. Mr. Qin told people yesterday that the seasonal epidemic is still rampant, but it is different from before. Many patients have blood in their sputum, or cough up blood from their entire mouth, or bleed from their nose, with very high fever, headache, and chest pain. Therefore, the previous method of dispelling and relieving is no longer effective, and the method of clearing and relieving must be used. With proper treatment, although there is no danger, the time is longer. If treatment is delayed or excessive sweating is induced, it can easily lead to mental confusion and irritability, so attention must be paid. Furthermore, Mr. Qin's younger brother, Dr. Qin Youan, who has studied medicine with his brother, has been practicing medicine since last year. Recently, he believes that the changeable weather this spring easily causes people to be susceptible to external pathogens, leading to prolonged illness. When patients first feel headache, nasal congestion, and aversion to cold, it indicates that the cold pathogen has just entered, being at the Taiyang meridian. The Inner Classic says, "If it is in the skin, it can be released by sweating." Based on research findings, he learned from this principle and modified the method of diaphoresis, using a simple steam wash treatment, which is extremely convenient. The prescription is two liang of Perilla leaves, four qian of Mentha (added later), eight qian of Schizonepeta, and eight qian of Saposhnikovia. Place the above four herbs in a pot, add a large amount of water, boil for a few boils, and then pour it into a washbasin. Have the patient lower their head over the basin, making sure it is directly above the basin, and cover it with a wrapper or a sheet, allowing the hot steam to rise without leakage. The mouth must be kept open to allow saliva to flow out until a slight sweat is felt on the back. After that, avoid wind at all costs. Mild cases need only one treatment, severe cases no more than two, and all are effective. This is specially recorded to inform the citizens, as a truly simple and convenient method for prevention and treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e181">The Registration of Zhenghua Silver Company is Still Difficult to Approve <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously received an application from the Zhenghua Silver Company in this city for registration. Because the company's capital was only 50,000 yuan, which was insufficient to fund operations, it was disapproved. Subsequently, the company sent a letter through the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that the current laws and regulations did not have a minimum limit for the qualifications of silver companies, and detailed the reasons, requesting approval for prior registration. Now, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce received another reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Received the presentation. Shanghai is a prosperous commercial area. The silver company mainly engages in straw hat export financing, and a capital of 50,000 yuan is insufficient for its operations. Although the current laws and regulations do not have a minimum limit, the Ministry should still consider the circumstances, weigh the pros and cons, and prevent the occurrence of risks. The request for registration is difficult to approve." The Chamber has forwarded this reply to the Zhenghua Silver Company for review.</p>

<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>▲ Seeking forgiveness is the beggar's hiding place. We should repay our debts.</p>
<p>▲ Long dresses seem to make modern girls reveal their solemnity slightly. Unfortunately, however, long dresses have the same purpose as advertisements.</p>
<p>▲ A person cannot make progress in his career if he has no enemies. Because enemies can frankly point out your shortcomings, like an ideal good friend.</p>
<p>▲ Love smiles at brave people, sneers at cowardly husbands, and laughs loudly at madmen.</p>
<p>▲ Although the speed of a car is faster than that of a carriage, when a pair of modern rural girls travel in the suburbs by car, occasionally, they cannot help themselves, and the car is not as safe as a carriage.</p>
<p>▲ Men can be too old to dance, to work, or to play games. However, when he sees a beautiful girl, he can't help but tidy up his clothes and make a vigorous effort.</p>
<p>▲ A man's love cannot gain more knowledge through experience. It is common to see them fail in this love and repeat the same mistakes the second time.</p>
<p>▲ There are many women who don't know how to choose a husband in their lives. It is too late to regret when they are old and approaching death.</p>
<p>▲ Newly married men and women are like two newly acquainted children. They cannot become acquainted until after a fight.</p>
<p>▲ Marriage is like national politics. There are always people who support it, oppose it, or even stir up trouble from it.</p>

<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>It has not been ten days since Fanshan passed away, and now we hear that Yuan Hanyun has also left us. I am overwhelmed with grief for the loss of old friends. My brother-in-law, Zhou Wuzhu, had a cordial relationship with Hanyun as host and guest. I also made friends through literature and often exchanged letters. I know a thing or two about his life. Hanyun, whose taboo name was Kewen, was the second child. His courtesy name was Baocun, also written as Baocen. His pseudonym was Guian. He once obtained Zhao Feiyan's jade ring, considering it a rare stroke of luck from the remnants of the palace's powder and rouge. He engraved a seal with the inscription "Yan Huan" to commemorate his treasure, using it in his poems and writings. He possessed the talent of both a poet and a military advisor. Among the Seven Talents of Xuan Nan, Hanyun was the leader. He once had a collection of poems printed in vermilion ink, corrected by Yi Shifu. Unfortunately, it was not widely circulated, and now it is out of print with no copies remaining. His occasional short couplets and phrases were filled with the magic of flying flowers and dancing butterflies between the lines. Actors and actresses, as well as people from the pleasure district, often obtained his couplets. Hanyun was known for his romanticism and fondness for entertainment. Hanyun was also able to perform on stage. He was particularly good at "Examining the Head and Stabbing Tang." In the past, when he lived in Shanghai, he was often invited to perform in dramas to raise funds for local public welfare. Hanyun never declined and often captivated the audience with his beautiful songs. He had a habit of enjoying the scenery, always had a couch set up, and treated night as day. He would wear short clothes and go barefoot. Even when guests arrived, he was not constrained. He would lie on the couch and browse through books. When he read something he liked, he would immediately grab a pen and write comments. He could lie on his back and write small characters on the margins of the book with his head. His handwriting was elegant and neat, surpassing that of previous calligraphers. People from all over the country sought his calligraphy, wearing down his doorstep. He occasionally painted, depicting flowers and plants with a few strokes, and they were filled with fragrance and ease. The interest was in the meaning, not in the standard. Truly, only a clever person could do it. He was lazy and disdainful of official hats and robes. A certain important person admired his talent and invited him to Zhejiang, specially building a fine residence by the Ming Sheng Lake for him to live in. Hanyun said that the beauty of the lake and mountains should not be wasted. He asked for a month to enjoy the scenery. After that, he would serve and work hard. The important person did not force him. Unexpectedly, after a few weeks, he secretly returned to his Shanghai residence. When the important person came to urge him in person, he only felt a sense of loss. His unruliness was like this. His appearance was slightly similar to that of General Haiming. A certain newspaper published the photos of the two together. Hanyun was in military uniform, and Haiming was in Confucian clothing. It was even more difficult to distinguish who was a tiger and who was a scholar. It was a beautiful story at the time. He had a sharp eye for appreciating antiques. However, he had strong self-confidence. Occasionally, he would buy fake goods. Even if someone told him the truth, he would not listen. He thought it was nonsense. When told again, he would scold, saying, "If I can get two of such fake goods, I would be willing to pay a heavy price to get them." He also liked to caress ancient coins. The year before last, he used an ancient coin as a betrothal gift for his son Bochong's engagement. His father-in-law, Fang Dishan, was also a famous scholar, so he could deeply sympathize with his unconventional customs. His thriftiness was a model for the world. His published works include "Huan Shang Private Records" and "Hanyun's Essays." It is said that Hanyun wrote a diary every day, without interruption in summer or winter, for nearly twenty years. It contains many secrets of the court and anecdotes of poetry and wine. If it is engraved, it will be an immortal work.</p>
<p>Juan'an Hanyun was one of my dearest friends in my life. When I was a guest in Shanghai in the past, we met almost every day. Poems and articles were exchanged, accumulating into a volume over time. He helped me a lot when I edited magazines such as "Half-Month Violet." In recent years, I have been living in Tianjin, and news has been scarce. I originally planned to go north to visit him in the late spring of this year. Unexpectedly, the bad news came and he rushed to Yulou Terrace. Looking back on the past, I am extremely sad. My brother has a wealth of writings. I have personally seen his diaries before. Every word is carefully written, and the articles are both practical and beautiful. Compared to Li Yuke's diary, it is not much different. I secretly hope that all my friends in the country will do their best to collect his posthumous works and compile them into a volume to be engraved and passed down for a long time.</p>

<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>Wu Changshuo (缶老) was initially known for his seal carving by Wu Dacheng and Yang Xian. His name gradually became known in Jiangzuo. When he was strong, he listened to the drum in Suzhou. He was unruly and somewhat arrogant. The superiors did not like him very much. Zhang Zuyi from Tongcheng was friendly with him. Zhang was good at official script, and Wu was good at seal script. Both had a passion for bronze and stone inscriptions. Zhang was also good at seal carving, with a charming touch in his vigorous style. Each established their own style. Both gentlemen were fat, short, and beardless. Viewers sometimes mistakenly thought they were eunuchs. Therefore, Wu called himself the Beardless Old Man in his later years. Wu's seals are better than others because they are round and tight. When others are arrogant, they only resemble his reclining posture. He uses a large knife to carve stones. My friend Zhang Tianzhou jokingly called him "Wu Junqing, the Wu Seal Star with the Big Knife." Tianzhou also loved to use a big knife for seal carving. When he was in a hurry, he did not choose his tools. He could make words with nail heads and scissor ends. It was similar to the copper seals of the Xin Mang Dynasty. He painted landscapes in a heavy and ancient style. There was no equal at the time. Wu was not good at painting, but his pine and bamboo paintings were quite interesting when they were executed with seal script. When he used red, it was thick and without measure. When people saw it, they said, "Let him see some colors." It could evoke a sigh.</p>

<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>The Star Opera Society has been established for more than a year. I am sincerely stingy and have not been able to participate in the rehearsals and listen to the elegant music. I am deeply regretful. On the 22nd of this month, the company held a concert at Dumei Road. The company's colleagues all appeared on stage, and it is impossible not to record it. Unfortunately, I am completely ignorant of Peking Opera. I only feel that the clear singing is graceful and pleasing to the eye and ear. Helpless, I can only pick up the saliva of the old man next door who spoke about the art of drama and use it for the entertainment of my fellow writers.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Shichuan's Two Major Plays: The famous director Mr. Zhang Shichuan usually studies the art of the screen and has never performed in person. Since the new film "The Scandalous History of the Screen" came out, Mr. Zhang's face has appeared on the screen for the first time. Since the success of "The Singing Girl Red Peony," he once showed his face on the red carpet. He actually had two major plays. On that day, he played Huang Tianba in "Falling Horse Lake," and his voice was clear and could compete with the famous amateur opera singer Detian Resident. In "The Three Courts Joint Trial," he played the Red Robe Commissioner with subtle expressions and without any hesitation. It was not easy.</p>
<p>▲ Zhou Jianyun's Steady Singing and Acting: Mr. Zhou Jianyun, the president of the opera company, also sang two good plays. He and Ms. Ying Yunwen performed "Visiting Mother," and he and Ms. Huang Xuexuan performed "Nantianmen." Mr. Zhou has been a ticket holder for a long time, and his acting is skilled, and his stage steps are steady. He does not lose the model of his predecessors. The lines are not sloppy. It is a pity that his voice has lost its luster. I think Mr. Zhou is too hard and has little rest.</p>
<p>▲ Wang Xuan and Jing Lin's Performance of Lotus Lantern: Mr. Wang Yushu and Ms. Xuan Jinglin performed "Lotus Lantern" together on the same day, which can be called evenly matched. They have already entered the realm of magic. Mr. Wang is a famous senior in the ticket circle and can perform many plays. Occasionally, he can completely get rid of the mundane atmosphere when he appears on stage. Ms. Xuan's singing voice is gentle and pleasant, and she has deeply mastered the essence of Yu Shuang. In addition, her facial expressions and gestures are all dramatic. It is no wonder that she is the mainstay of the Star Opera Company. Only Xuan can do it.</p>
<p>▲ The Hard Work of the Martial Arts Play: The most dedicated martial arts plays were "Baishuitan," performed by Xu Xinfu and Wu Wanxiang, and "Jiamengguan," performed by Huang Tianyin and Wu Wanxiang. Wanxiang is proficient in martial arts, and Xinfu is a director of martial arts films. He has the demeanor of a Confucian scholar and actually reversed his original appearance. Dong Tianya has been performing amateur opera for a long time, and his skills are proficient and do not lose their rules. All three gentlemen have recently been studying with Mr. Chen Yuelou. Their deep understanding of martial arts is well-founded.</p>
<p>▲ Red Peony's Yutangchun: The most flavorful night play was "Little Cowherd," performed by Zheng Xiaoqiu and Gu Meijun. This play depicts the love of young children, and it is beautiful without being obscene. It is rare. The finale was "The Three Courts Joint Trial," performed by Hu Die, the protagonist of Red Peony, and Mr. Wang Xianzai and other members. Hu Die won with her expressions, and Xianzai won with his lines. The old man continued, "My old eyes are dim and I cannot give an accurate evaluation. However, such achievements are already rare. In addition, all the artists are talented. If they can work harder, the next time will be even more spectacular."</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's "Interview with the Yezhou Studio," the words "沉淪" were mistakenly placed after "浮沈" on line 18. Also, the number "四" under the title "Indian Travels" was a mistake for "五". This correction is hereby made.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Zhao Tieqiao After Death <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Manyin</p>
<p>Zhao Tieqiao was also a famous scholar from Sichuan. He has a considerable history of contributions to the revolution. Two years ago, he had a relationship with the famous prostitute Xue Lin in the Qinhuai River area, which was well known. However, he did not lose his elegance as a celebrity. Later, he became a commissioner of the Shanghai China Merchants Bureau, but he was assassinated. After his death, he was extremely desolate. It is said that although Zhao was a commissioner of the China Merchants Bureau, at this time, the bureau was in a state of turmoil. The Northern Expedition was in full swing, and he was busy dispatching ships, transporting soldiers and weapons. People regarded him as a fat cat, but he was not greedy. He was killed in middle age, leaving behind many children, all of whom were young. (It was seen in a certain newspaper that Zhao Guangzu was mentioned, with a note stating that he was Zhao Tieqiao's son. In fact, there is another Zhao Guangzu in Shanghai.) Later, when the government discussed Zhao's pension, in addition to a special grant of 1,000 yuan for funeral expenses, the Ministry of Personnel assessed and approved a pension of 720 yuan per year for his family, based on one-tenth of his last monthly salary of 600 yuan, in accordance with the regulations on pensions for officials. In addition, in accordance with the same regulations, a one-time pension of 1,200 yuan, equivalent to two months' salary, was granted to the family. However, the Ministry of Personnel's report stated that the deceased commissioner had devoted himself to the revolution for more than 20 years, reorganized the shipping business, and facilitated military operations. His achievements were great, and his previous merits should be commemorated. This assessment was based on regulations and was not a reward for revolutionary achievements. Later, after the State Council meeting, a special one-time pension of 3,000 yuan and an annual pension of 960 yuan were granted to the family of the late Commissioner Zhao. This was very generous, even in the National Government. However, with this monthly pension of 80 yuan, Mrs. Zhao had to raise her many children, which was very hard. I remember in the autumn of last year, Zhao Tieqiao's daughter, Zhao Yinmei, who was only 12 or 13 years old, was studying at a certain girls' school. There was a teacher who did not know that Miss Zhao was Tieqiao's daughter. Once, in class, when discussing Chinese shipping, he criticized Zhao Tieqiao's management of the China Merchants Bureau, saying that it had no achievements. Although Miss Zhao was young, she remembered that her father had been brutally murdered, and after his death, someone was still criticizing her father in front of her. She immediately stood up and left the classroom, crying bitterly. After returning home, the mother and daughter hugged each other and cried. Since then, she never went back to that school. Alas, is this not a true fact that must bring tears?</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Regarding the caste system, the doctor said that this system still exists today, but it is slightly more flexible. The first class is the Brahmin caste. All monks must come from this caste. Other castes are not allowed. The second is the Kshatriya caste, the warrior class. The third is the merchant class. The fourth is the Sudra caste, the servant class. The four castes are not allowed to intermarry. The son of a farmer is always a farmer, and the son of a worker is always a worker, as Guanzi of China said. Buddha wanted to break this system, but in the end, people did not believe in his teachings. It can also be seen how great its power is. From this, we can know the importance of Indian monks. It has a long history. Because only the first class can become monks. Other classes are not allowed. Things are rare and strange. They are originally nobles, and becoming monks is even more noble. However, since the entry of the British into India, the Indian people felt the pressure of foreign forces, and the movement for liberation began. Recently, new ideas have emerged, and there have been gradual changes.</p>
<p>At 2 pm this afternoon, the Social Education Association gave a lecture. There were Tan Jueshi, Lai Wei, Zhang Guoji, and others. Consul Lu and his wife were also in attendance and took photos. At 5 pm, a general meeting was held at the Indian Mahayana Buddhist Association Lecture Hall. The principal of the girls' school, Sarala Dervi, presided over the meeting. She is the niece of Tagore. At that time, six or seven hundred people attended the meeting. Ms. West was also there. Consul Lu Chunfang and his wife were also there. Everyone asked Lu to give a speech. After my speech, the chairman translated it into Bengali. There was also an old philosopher, Krishna, who was 70 years old and had been running a newspaper for 50 years. He gave a loud speech about the great light of Eastern culture, saying that all beings could be saved from now on. The audience was moved. Then his daughter, Mrs. Boss, sang praises. The meeting adjourned at 7 pm.</p>
<p>On the 24th, I visited Master Daojie but did not meet him. I met a Burmese student at 8 Eden Hospital road. This is the Burmese Monks' Buddhist Temple. All Burmese monks and students who worship Buddha can live here. Food is self-provided. It costs more than ten yuan per month. Chinese people can also live there. When I asked how many Burmese students there were, they replied more than ten. The temple cost more than 50,000 yuan and is used to entertain Burmese people. Now, there are Burmese Monks' Buddhist Temples in all the Buddhist sites. Chinese people can all live there. Food is self-provided. Then, Burmese Buddhists are worthy of being Buddhist heroes. The Burmese are humble, easy-going and approachable, like calm water without waves. The Indians have a vast and boundless aura, and their bodies are also tall, very different from the Burmese. The Burmese should naturally belong to India, but now they are said to be separate and independent. This is due to the British political movement.</p>
<p>At 5 pm on the 25th, Mrs. Sen invited me to a tea party. Lu and his wife were both there. The Sen family lived in London for 17 years and have now returned. They know many English gentlemen and ladies, such as Russell Wells and others. They also like Chinese people very much. Chinese art is the best in the world. Japanese art is also famous, but not as good. She told me to wait a few weeks, and Tagore will return to China. We can discuss the method of the world cultural movement together. I saw a Western store sign in the market that said China &amp; glass, which is porcelain and glass. They use the word "支那", from which we know that porcelain is called China.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Powerful Fluctuations in Finance and Gold Markets <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Terrible Ups and Downs: Yesterday, March 26th, the gold price experienced dramatic changes, soaring and then plummeting, fluctuating wildly by six or seven taels in an instant. Giant waves and angry tides were seen again in the market. From morning till night, there were a total of sixteen taels of twists and turns, ultimately ending with a slight drop. People were alarmed, and the chaotic scene was indescribable. Although foreign exchange rates strengthened and then weakened, the change was not as drastic as in the gold market. Quoted prices were reduced by one level. Some dealers were first caught short and then covered their positions. Transactions on the surface were varied. In the morning session, Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, and Wu Pin, among others, were buying, while Heng Xing and Yong Heng, among others, were selling heavily. Overseas silver markets also reported declines, so the gold price suddenly reached a peak, even breaking through the 700 tael mark. Later, merchants from Guangdong and other places were inclined to sell, leading to a sharp downward turn, with a plunge of ten taels. However, the situation was confusing. It was rumored that Siam was selling a large quantity of silver ingots, so there was a slight rise. At noon, selling pressure intensified again, and the market softened again. In the afternoon session, Yong Heng, Yu Da, and others continued to sell, especially as the shortage of drafts worsened, suddenly falling below 690 taels.</p>
<p>A Rapid Opening: The May opening in the morning surged by ten taels and four qian to 699 taels. Large bars fell by 5/16, and the silver price fell by 3/4. The European market was calm, and private telegrams also fell by 5/8. Wu Pin, Yuan Mao Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, and others competed to buy, driving the price from 98 taels to 702 taels and five qian. Drafts settled in British gold were not slack. Mai Hang quoted 8125 for forward contracts. Soon, Heng Xing and Yong Heng both sold, and British gold could be settled at 875, causing the price to fall to 96 taels. When the first exchange rate was announced, it was reduced by 25, with US dollars at 50 cents and Japanese yen at 2.75 fen, making it 98 taels. But in a moment, it depreciated by more than three taels, reaching 94 taels and five qian. Wu Pin and others sold, and Fu Chang and others bought, partly because British and Japanese banks were absorbing currency. Forward British gold was at 9375, so the price rose to 700 taels and five qian. Later, Heng Xing, Da De Cheng, and others continued to sell, and in an instant, the price fell by as much as seven or eight taels. Around 10 o'clock, it was 92 taels and five qian. Suddenly, it was heard that a large quantity of silver had been sold abroad. People's spirits lifted, and Yuan Mao Yong, Wu Pin, Fu Yu, and others all came to buy. Banks also traded July British gold at 875, and Hua Bi offered recent British gold at 8125, leading to a surge of more than eight taels, reaching 701 taels at 10:15. Later, Yong Heng and others continued to sell, and Wu Pin's hedging positions also came to sell, and with British gold weakening, the price plunged by six or seven taels, reaching 94 taels and a half after 10:30. Banks then absorbed June British gold at 875, reaching 700 taels at 11:15. Afterwards, the price fluctuated erratically, with different exchanges showing divergent trends. There were about three or four taels of price differences. After 11:45, the market became increasingly fatigued. Sellers were strong on the surface. At noon, the price was 91 taels and five qian, and at the closing, it was 93 taels, with a further fluctuation of more than one tael, rising again to 94 taels. The front and back prices changed to 759 taels, with a calculated price difference of about 60 taels, and the price at noon was 66 or 67 taels.</p>
<p>A Weak Afternoon Market: The afternoon market opened lower at 91 taels and a half. Sentiment seemed soft. Subsequently, due to Indian exchange rates reporting a small four annas, the price rose to 94 taels, but in an instant, it fell to 90 taels, as exchange rates tended to loosen. Then, Yuan Heng and others bought, and banks traded June British gold at 9375, pushing the price as high as 95 taels and five qian. Then, there was a small drop of six or seven qian. Zhejiang and Hua Bi also traded current British gold at 13.875, causing a sudden rise to 97 taels. Afterwards, Yong Heng successively sold long positions, so the price seemed difficult to sustain. Initially, it was supported, but soon it could not hold, depreciating by three or four taels, with only two or three taels of rebound. After 2:45, it felt particularly weak. Approaching 4 o'clock, it broke into 90 taels, suddenly reaching 86 taels and five qian, leading to a double-settlement price (logged at 87 taels). However, the differences in entry and exit among exchanges varied. Heng Xing then bought, adding three taels, reaching 89 taels and a half. However, selling pressure did not cease. By the 4:30 closing, the price was only 86 taels and five qian. At this time, Wan Xing and Shun Li came to buy, suddenly pulling the price up by three or four taels, reaching slightly above 90 taels, a decrease of two taels and one qian compared to the previous day (according to the listed price). If calculated according to the black market, it was still up by two taels. The highest price for the entire day was 702 taels and a half, and the lowest price was 686 taels and five qian, with a total fluctuation of sixteen taels. Wu Pin's early market price was 700 taels, and the noon closing price was 94 taels, with an afternoon price of 3 taels and a closing price of 94 taels and five qian. The revealed price difference was 72 taels. Logged prices were: 86 taels for March morning, 89 taels for April, 93 taels for May, 80 taels for March afternoon, 83 taels for April, 87 taels for May, and 86 taels for supplementary water in the afternoon, and 80 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Complex Transactions: The exchanges involved included Yuan Mao Yong, Cui Chang Yong, Yu Da, Yuan Tai, Cheng Feng Yong, Da De Cheng, and Wu Pin buying, while Shun Li, Wan Xing, Yong Heng, and Heng Xing sold. Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Tai Heng, Heng Yu, and others showed divergent trends in buying and selling. In the afternoon, Yong Heng 2, Yuan Tai, and Yu Da all sold, while Qian Chang Xiang, Shun Li, Tong Tai Chang, Wan Xing, Heng Xing, and Fu Chang bought. Fu Tai Heng, Yu He, and Fu Yu had occasional entries and exits. Speculator Mr. Wu was quite active in chasing prices. Guangdong merchants sold five or six thousand bars and bought eight or nine hundred bars. Dalian merchants sold a total of more than two thousand bars and bought one thousand seven or eight hundred bars. Yong Heng sold off more than three thousand long positions.</p>

<p>Internal Market Looser... Transactions Still Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, British and American silver markets both fell, and exchange rates also decreased. The market was calm, and the exchange rates quoted by HSBC were reduced by one level. British gold fell by 25, to one shilling and three and a half pence. US dollars fell by 50 cents, to thirty-one yuan and three hundred and seventy-five. Indian exchange fell by one and a half yuan, to eighty-six and a half rupees. French francs fell by thirteen yuan, to eight hundred and two yuan.

Japanese gold increased by two fen and seventy-five cents, to one tael, five qian, and seven and a half fen. However, the internal markets for British, American, and Japanese exchanges were still tight in the morning, but later turned flat, due to the gold market weakening after strengthening. In the afternoon, there seemed to be a loosening trend, and the standard gold price had retreated to below 690 taels. However, the turbulence expanded, making it difficult to take action. Comparing the results of each exchange with the previous day, British gold increased slightly by 0.0625, US dollars increased by 0.125, and Japanese gold decreased by 0.5 fen, reflecting the different trends of being tight on the surface and flat underneath. The situation was peaceful, unlike the turmoil in the gold market. Transactions among Chinese gold businesses were still active, with some dealers first caught short and then covering their positions. Overall, sales were more numerous than purchases. Approximately 300,000 pounds of British gold were traded. Banks such as Hua Bi, Mai Hang, Shanghai, Taiwan, Zheng Jin, and Zhong Fu all sold, while Hua Bi, Mai Hang, Da Ying, Shanghai, Sumitomo, and Chase also had considerable buying interest. Banks also traded tens of thousands of pounds among themselves, and tens to hundreds of thousands of US dollars were traded.

<p>Yesterday's silver dollar market atmosphere was flat due to sluggish supply and demand. The market situation was depressed. The silver exchange rate was 7 qian, 2 fen, 4 li, and a half for both the morning and noon markets, which was the same as the noon market of the previous day. However, transactions were also very few. In the morning market, the exchange of drawn drafts was 1.08 million, and in the noon market, it was only 555,000. Banknotes were traded only outside the market, with 110,000 in the morning market and 85,000 in the noon market. Spot silver was traded at more than 200,000 in both markets. The silver split was 4 fen in the morning market and 3 fen in the noon market. There was still no water added to the clearing, so it was a white clearing.

<p>Bond Prices Remain Stagnant, Trading Volume at 5.6 Million</p>
<p>Three-Month Futures Trading Suspended Today to Prepare for Settlement</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot bond trading was scarce, opening at 18,000 yuan. Futures market buying and selling sentiment was extremely idle. Total trading volume for the front and back markets was 5,630,000 yuan. As the settlement period neared, the bond market environment lacked change, so the market situation was idle and the supply and demand situation was balanced. Bond prices were increasingly stagnant, with minimal increases and decreases compared to the previous day. However, disaster relief spot bonds, which had been without trading for a long time, increased by as much as 2 yuan and 2 jiao compared to the previous month. Three-month futures trading of public bonds will be suspended from today to prepare for settlement.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Yarn and Cloth: Yarn Market Presents Mediocre Characteristics <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly fatigued, but the trend is still firm. Current sales remain decent, and export transactions with foreigners are still under negotiation. There is also interest in coarse yarn, so a certain major merchant has a very firm attitude and no intention of relaxing. In addition, raw materials are expensive, making it fundamentally difficult for the yarn market to fall significantly. However, most small investors are actively shorting, as prices have reached high levels. Rong Xing sold 5,850 bales in large quantities in the front and back markets on behalf of a major yarn factory, impacting the market. However, major dealers continued to buy and add to their positions, so the yarn market, on the whole, has the potential to stabilize. Japanese merchants are continuously scouring the market for Japanese yarn to be baled and shipped to Japan. The future still depends on actual movements.</p>
<p>Average Human Bidding Prices: The human bidding market opened strongly in the morning, with prices rising by eight or nine qian. In the second and third sessions, Miao Factory sold, with a huge bale volume, causing the market to suddenly fall, with prices decreasing by four, five, or six qian. In the afternoon, there were still major dealers selling, making the market situation even more fatigued, with prices decreasing by three, four, five, or seven qian. Total trading volume for the entire day was 49,850 bales. Rong Xing sold 5,850 bales, Shen Xin 1,250 bales, Gong Tai 1,250 bales, Rui Da 1,250 bales, Yi Cheng 1,000 bales, and Yi Chang 1,250 bales. Da Fu bought 1,750 bales, He Shen 1,150 bales, Tian Long 1,450 bales, Rui Da 1,550 bales, Chang Feng 2,350 bales, Yong Chang 1,400 bales, Xin Cheng 650 bales, and De Ji 1,250 bales.

<p>Yarn Sales Still Smooth: Current yarn sales are still good. Statistics show that various groups bought a total of 1,800 bales for the entire day. Fellow merchants bought 700 bales. Market conditions are flat and fatigued. Out-of-town merchants from inland areas bought 400 bales, Southeast Asia bought 130 bales, Qingdao 400 bales, Shantou 50 bales, Fujian 50 bales, Guangdong 60 bales, Jiangxi 110 bales, Tianjin 50 bales, Northern groups 400 bales, and miscellaneous groups 200 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Cotton Market in Stable State <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is relatively firm, as US cotton is stable and exchange rates are difficult to change. Therefore, sentiment is very high, and long positions have a strong attitude. However, current sales are flat, and factory buying is not strong. Underlying inventory is scarce, so there are fewer new sellers. The market situation is very stable.</p>
<p>Han Standard Still Tight: The Han Standard market opened flat in the morning. As foreign cotton was not loose, there were fewer sellers. The current month was down 4 qian, and the far month was up 1 qian 5 fen. The marked flower market was even tighter in the afternoon, with each up 2 qian and a half. Trading volume totaled 84,700 dan. Yu Da sold 1,300 dan, Rong Xing 1,700 dan, Shen Ji 2,400 dan, Tai Chang 3,900 dan, and Yong Feng 2,500 dan. Ji Feng bought 2,500 dan, Yu Da 2,200 dan, Heng Yi 2,500 dan, Heng De 3,200 dan, Shen Chang 2,000 dan, Chang Feng 3,100 dan, and Xin Cheng 2,500 dan. Closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Grains: Flour Market Flat and Firm <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market situation for each month seemed to be firm and stable. Foreign wheat quotations rebounded by one or two jiao. The weather also changed from cold to hot suddenly, and the rain was heavy, so each near and far term rebounded by about 1 fen compared to the lowest price of the previous day. By the afternoon, as buying interest from foreign merchants was not strong, the market atmosphere for each month gradually fatigued again. In addition, the exchange's chips have reportedly reached more than 15 million, so with such a large volume of goods, sales are difficult to match supply, and the bleak future is inevitable. As a result, this month was slightly better than the previous day by 2.5 li, April was unchanged, May and June were better by 5 li, and July and August were better by 2.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Guest Xian Rice Even More Sluggish <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Guest Xian rice market situation showed no sign of turning around. Although there were no Changjiang river shipments arriving, small amounts of goods continued to arrive by train. Local appetite was sluggish, and it was even more difficult for out-of-town merchants to transport, making the market even more stagnant. Although train rice had arrived, the high cost prevented sellers from lowering prices for quick sales, so there were no transactions in the market. The entire market only traded 210 bales of Nanjing unpolished rice at 8 yuan, 5 jiao, and 6 fen, with the price similar to the previous market, but down about 1 jiao compared to the beginning of the month.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Wheat Futures High in Morning, Flat in Afternoon <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning, the market atmosphere for each month rebounded and appeared stable, as foreign wheat quotations increased by one or two jiao. Local merchants from the Zhejiang route, seeing that the market seemed to be stabilizing again, and thinking that the spring harvest would be poor, mostly planned to buy in small quantities, so each near and far term was better than the lowest price of the previous day by 2 or 3 fen. By the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere fatigued again. As this month was near settlement, many long positions were gradually closing out, falling back by 3 fen compared to the highest price in the morning. Far term contracts were also dragged down by the fatigue in flour, falling by 1 or 2 fen. Looking to the future, with the congestion of goods, it is difficult to expect prices to rise. As a result, this month was down 1 fen from the previous day, April was up 1 fen, May was up 2 fen, June was up 1 fen, July was up 2 fen, and August was up 1 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Sugar Market: Japanese Cart Sugar's Falling Trend Quite Sharp <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market telegram from production areas showed that Cuban spot sugar and New York sugar futures for May were unchanged from before, while September was down 1 fen, and December was down 2 fen. Java spot sugar was still unchanged. Transactions in the association market were scarce, and sentiment was very weak. Dutch sugar No. 24 white sugar was pouring out, with a asking price of 10 taels and 3 qian, but there were no buyers. In the later market, a few transactions were made at 10 taels and 2 qian, but the market was not exceptional. Less interest was shown in medium white sugar. Japanese sugar transactions were also dwindling, and the falling trend was quite sharp. N-mark was traded at 10 taels, with a trading volume of 500 bales, a sharp drop of 1.5 qian from before, and the market situation remained flat and fatigued. Y.T. mark was offered at 9 taels and 9 qian, Y.P. mark was offered at 10 taels and 1 qian and a half, and Y.R.Q. mark was offered at 9 taels and 6 qian, but buying interest was also silent.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Diminishing Sources of Wufu White Ice <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Rumored Price Difficult to Loosen Further</p>
<p>Recently, sales of Wufu white ice in Shanghai have been slow, and sources have been decreasing. According to a letter from Xiamen, the factory there is planning to temporarily cease production. Therefore, the future supply will inevitably be even scarcer, and market prices are unlikely to loosen excessively. Recently, quotations in the city have consistently been around 8 liang 8 qian per unit, showing a firm trend. Other bulk goods have seen sluggish trading and very few transactions. The amount arriving on Xiamen ships each period is also limited, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Piece Goods: Actual Sales Turn Brisk, Prices Steadily Rise <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Cloth from this factory: The market is gradually trending upward, especially fine cloth and fine twill, which are the most sought-after. The reason is that actual sales have become brisker, and those holding inventories are gaining profit, causing people to be very enthusiastic. Yesterday, fine cloth rose by about 1 qian. Blue Flying Fish sold for 7 liang 9 qian, Blue Double Fish for 7 liang 5 qian 5 fen, Trumpet Boy for 7 liang 5 qian, and Yang Crane Colored Ball also reached 7 liang 4 qian 5 fen. Fine twill Yang Crane has also reached 7 liang 3 qian 5 fen, and Blue Double Fish 7 liang 2 qian. Merchants from the Yangtze River region are actively purchasing. Coarse cloth remains stable; 11-pound Three Rabbits, Three Deer, and Man Bell are still around 5 liang 4 qian. 16-pound goods are gradually increasing; Old Man Head is 7 liang 9 qian 5 fen, Double Elephant 7 liang 8 qian 5 fen. Existing stock of Ewo blue striped bleached cloth is gradually dwindling; Golden Three Pagodas bleached cloth sells for 8 liang 8 qian, it is said.</p>
<p>East and West Piece Goods: Yesterday, the trend also turned firm. Merchants are eagerly seeking out bleached Eastern goods. Crane Deer has opened at 10 liang 2 qian 5 fen, Fortune Longevity Three Stars at 11 liang, Guo Ziyi at 12 liang 7 qian 5 fen, and Flower Bird at 8 liang 2 qian. Straight tribute woolen cloth has also suddenly turned to an upward trend, likely due to the gradual scarcity of existing stock. Moganshan Hunting Goose is heavily discounted at 3 qian 5 fen. Yuan Yang yarn is also holding firm; Dian Qiuxiang is steadily rising, selling for 10 liang 6 qian, Yuan Ji Beauty 10 liang 3 qian, and Small Beauty remains at 12 liang 5 qian. Among all the goods, only fine serge still lacks a good outlook, mainly due to the abundance of inventory. Customer groups are primarily from the Yangtze River and Jiangxi regions, with groups from Hankou and Qingdao also showing more activity than before. The overall trend for Western goods is stable; plain pongee is seeing some transactions on this street, with Zhonghe goods at 7 qian and Lulin goods at 7 qian 2 fen 5 li, it is said.</p>

<p>Last year's production of pierced cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was not strong, while demand from domestic silk factories is high, resulting in supply falling short of demand. The market is becoming increasingly firm. The existing stock in Shanghai is limited. Yesterday, a merchant from the mainland brought 35 dan of Hangzhou pierced cocoons, priced at 62 liang.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Metals: Black Iron Sheet Drops Another 2 Qian 5 Fen <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to oversupply, the market for 18-gauge black iron sheets has been unusually weak. Even traditionally well-selling factories have seen limited actual use recently, so they lack purchases. Therefore, the sluggishness of the market is rare among all metal goods. The price is only 11 liang 7 qian 5 fen, down another 2 qian 5 fen from before. Spot transactions in the market are also few and far between, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e207">White Iron Sheet Waits for its Opportunity <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The market for 24-gauge and 26-gauge white iron sheets has been quiet for a long time, so standards have also become sluggish. In the past three or four days, construction groups have inquired, and railway and military factories have also reportedly made purchases. Therefore, market negotiations have suddenly become lively, morale is strong, and standards are rebounding. It is estimated that 24-gauge sells for 15 liang 5 qian per dan, and 26-gauge for 17 liang, which is 2 qian 5 fen higher than the previous market price. It is said that over 400 dan were sold yesterday, it is said.</p>

<p>New iron wire has been out of stock for a long time, causing general purchasers to yearn for it like a prolonged drought hoping for a rain dragon. Recently, according to news from foreign firms, it is said that 400 to 500 barrels of this commodity will be in stock before the 10th of next month. Therefore, the market prospects are bound to be lively, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Deadline Extension for Essay Contest of The Era Youth Society <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The Era Youth Society was originally a product of adapting to the environment. We can clearly see its past performance in its work. In recent years, the division and morbidity within the youth community have indeed created a widespread crisis of misfortune. On the one hand, due to the fundamental deformity of China's education system and the survival of feudal remnants in inland society, as well as the harassment of warlords and communist bandits, the threat of the pain of being out of school frequently strikes the hearts of young people. At the same time, the coercion of imperialism with weapons to invade has caused the original general economic organization of Chinese society to undergo a shaking reflection. As a result, the severity of intellectual unemployment has added another layer of sorrow. Thus, young people, in addition to being out of school, have suffered the misfortune of increased unemployment. The development of these two major problems has indeed led young people to a path of extreme depression. Therefore, some young people, seeing that the trend of the times cannot be constantly stifled, have risen up to make a call. We can generally see this point in the arguments published in their "Era Youth." Recently, they have been even more focused on their work. In order to meet the general desires, they have specifically expanded the original space several times, with both quality and quantity advancing simultaneously. It is truly commendable that so many students can achieve such results. Regarding the essay contest, I have previously introduced it in an article. Recently, I heard that the society, in order to seek a more comprehensive consideration, has specifically extended the deadline to April 20. Because its topics, "Several Important Issues for Young People of the Era" and "Literature and Politics," are precisely of great connection to the current era and young people themselves, it is natural to need more excellent works in order to inspect the degree of awakening of the general youth. There have also been submissions from inland areas such as Hangzhou, which shows the potential of its promotion. In order to increase interest, the society has also prepared cash prizes: thirty yuan for the first place, twenty yuan for the second place, ten yuan for the third place, and commemorative gifts for the fourth to tenth places. In addition to being published in "Era Youth," the selected manuscripts are also intended to be compiled into a special collection, with the author's photograph attached to the front of the volume for visual clarity. It is hoped that young people standing on the stage of the era will actively respond to the call, so that we can express the irrepressible emotions in our hearts.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Datong University Student Self-Government Association <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Dong</p>
<p>Holds Representative Assembly</p>
<p>Since its establishment, Datong University has had a close-knit and sound student association, which has existed for seven years. The school is progressing rapidly, and the number of students increases every year, now exceeding 1,600. The achievements of the student association are also progressing along with it. Since the beginning of this spring semester, the previous student association has followed the central government's regulations on the organizational outline of student self-government associations, and has actively prepared for re-election. Each college and department elected one representative out of every twenty people. The all-school representative assembly was held yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM in classroom 212. More than sixty people attended, including Xie Shoufu, Xie Zhimin, Tong Shiquan, and Ms. Hu Kewen, Chen Jing, etc. The atmosphere at the meeting was quite enthusiastic. The officers of the assembly were the presidium Xu Zexiang, Wu Daquan, and Secretary Dai Daxin. First, Chairman Xu Zexiang gave the opening remarks, outlining four points: (1) The past history and spirit of the student association; (2) The reasons and process for changing from a student association to a self-government association; (3) The meaning of self-government; (4) The hope that today's assembly will review the work of the past student association, set the direction for future work, and elect leaders to lead the work of the self-government association to achieve the meaning of self-government and the mission it bears. Next, President Ou Yuanhuai gave a speech, encouraging and rewarding, hoping that all key members would work together in harmony, implement the spirit of cooperation, and assist in the development of school affairs. Next, Director of Group Education Yu Zhihan gave a speech, and the representative of the district branch Cui Buwu gave a speech. The discussion items should have been carried out, but later, due to the large number of important proposals received by the secretariat from each college and department, and due to time constraints, the assembly decided to leave them for the next discussion. The agenda was immediately changed to hold elections. As a result, Wang Jianmin, Xu Zexiang, and Zhou Zhaoshao were elected as the presidium of the representative assembly, and Wang Ruinian, Cui Buwu, Cheng Liangneng, and fifteen others were elected as members of the executive committee. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e213">"Duckweed Shadows" of the Duckweed Shadow Society <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>We must also say that the youth's keen love for literature and art is a good phenomenon. Since the May Fourth New Culture Movement, the youth's inclination to refined life has shifted into a new stage. Their pursuit of literature and art has the intention of making up for shortcomings and comforting the soul. Although it is inevitable that many are reflections of the self, it is not necessarily a sign of young people's urgent search for a spiritual home in a certain sense. In such a bad environment, all realities cannot satisfy desires, so it is natural to pour into this aspect. Therefore, such a rising trend is not an accidental fact. In recent years, the organization of youth literary groups has been increasing day by day, as we can see from the various schools. Not long ago, we discovered another literary collective organized by young people from various schools, called the Duckweed Shadow Society. The leaders are Zhang Yifei, Mei Yonggeng, Mei Hongying, etc. They published a half-open newspaper called "Duckweed Shadows" monthly, which has now been published to the third issue. In the "Inaugural Remarks," they explained their attitude in this way:</p>
<p>The Duckweed Shadow Society is organized by several sincere young people. Hot blood is on our bodies, and pens are in our hands. This small newspaper is to reveal our sincere emotions. The era is so damn worthy. Young people in this era, as long as your soul has not been lost and your senses have not become numb, who does not feel a kind of youthful sorrow? Several of us sincere young people cannot stand the ugliness of society and cannot bear the depression in our hearts. Therefore, we are damned by everything. We express the real emotions in our hearts. Therefore, we disregarded everything and created this small garden.</p>
<p>From this point of view, their self-composition in the exploration of literature and art is very strong. However, from another perspective, it is precisely a manifestation of the lack of consciousness among the general youth. They often like to act recklessly as a cultivation act, which is of course very regrettable. I have not been able to clearly understand the meaning of "Duckweed Shadows" in its naming, but judging from the content of the three issues that have been published, it is just like the floating shadows of duckweed in life, and the outpouring of a kind of sentimentality is indeed extremely strong. Although we cannot deny the inherent real demands of this kind of lament, we, as young people standing on such a stage of the times, do not need to pick up a pen to write some curse words, and think that we are mentally happy. I should have greater aspirations and also a plan to enrich our lives. Most of the authors here are young people in middle school, so it is rare to have such achievements. However, what we should pay attention to is that we cannot just call out for ourselves. Since we are in the realm of literature and art, we should have the skills to overcome. Finally, I would like to say to the members of the Duckweed Shadow Society that young people living in this transitional period have many sorrows, but we should not erase our lives just for this. I feel that there is a waste of time for some young people who like to write complaints. I hope that you will not be so sentimental in the whole article, and you must actively express the emotion of upward efforts, which is what we hope for.</p>

<p>▲ The New World Hotel declares that Shanghai is full of hotels with similar facilities. Only this hotel can make guests feel truly happy in spirit. The grand and magnificent auditorium is adorned with Xu Zhengbai's landscape paintings and Huang Taixuan's collected couplets, which are particularly elegant and pleasant. It is a well-known venue for exhibitions of paintings and calligraphy by famous Shanghai figures. Whenever celebrations and banquets are held, and guest performances are staged, the hall is always packed but never crowded, which shows the spaciousness of the auditorium.</p>
<p>▲ Jinlili Zhongshi Old Ziyang Temple on Sanma Road declares that this shop has been established for more than 100 years and has been manufacturing famous flower dew wines, seasonal foods, fine official gift pickles, canned sweets, etc. The business is prosperous and famous far and wide. Recently, in order to facilitate customers and expand sales, a branch has been specially set up on East Seward Road (north of Zhonghongqiao). It opened on March 21 and held a month-long sale, making business even more prosperous.</p>

Recently, the film "The Legend of Jin Tai," produced by Huang Jiaojun, directed by Lu Yeyuan, and starring Qian Siying and Bao Gusong, will be completed at the end of this month. This play has a lot of chivalrous spirit. The company has spared no effort or financial resources to film "The Legend of Jin Tai" into a feature film, not to make the audience superstitious about gods and monsters, but to make the audience learn from the heroic spirit and chivalrous style in the film.</p>

<p>▲ Calligraphy is the highest art in China. Since the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, the academy style has been neglected. Most young people tend to follow unorthodox paths to deceive themselves. Even those who are willing to follow the right path are plagued by a lack of teachers and wander astray. Mr. Wu Yi of Suzhou has deep knowledge of the six methods of calligraphy and is respected by all walks of life. He is also tireless in guiding the younger generation. Recently, at the urging of Mr. Zhang Yipeng, a calligraphy correspondence course department has been specially established to broaden education. Those who aspire to learn calligraphy should not miss this rare and good teacher. The address for correspondence is Mr. Wu Luping, Jukangzhuang, Tianjin Road, Shanghai. Detailed regulations will be sent upon request.</p>
