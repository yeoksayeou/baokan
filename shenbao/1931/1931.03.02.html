<h3>全印大會對印督答案不滿</h3>
<p>三項先决條件</p>
<p>竟被完全拒絶</p>
<p>▲路透社二十八日新德里電全印大會工作委員會已切實拒絶印督歐溫在與甘地談話時所出之答案全印大會之所以有此决定者顯然因有三件大難題（一）秉公調查警察之逾分行爲、（二）印人有權糾察售賣外布與酒之商店、（三）印人有製鹽權、全印大會要求此三事、而當局對此休戰時之先决條件、則未能承認、</p>
<h3>挽救銀價跌落</h3>
<p>非單獨行動所能奏効</p>
<p>印財委在立法會發表意見</p>
<p>▲路透社二十八日新德里電　印度政府之財政委員許斯特今晚在立法會稱、近有人建議、印度應停止出售現銀、但世界銀礦出産不絶、此種建議、可謂奇談、銀價現加至每盎士六安那、極有情理、决不致阻遏印度境内現銀之銷費、去年渠曾提議會同其他與銀有關係國維持世界銀價、不幸僅有美國銀礦業直接響應、而其所擬之辦法、則如在新銀出産依然無限時、政府所存之銀不得出售、想立法會决不望印府抛其權利、而接受此單方面之協定也、全世界皆以印度爲用銀國、印度在一九三○年三月底以前之五年中、每年吸收銀一萬零八百萬盎士、準諸現象、印度本年吸收當不在此數之下、而印政府所售出自己存銀、僅九千萬盎士而已、印度必須保留自由行動、吾人須自問合作可否達到所期望之目的、渠愈研究此事、愈覺銀價之跌落、决非一隅之舉動、亦愈信非單獨行動所能收效、金類物大部跌價、不以銀爲限、其原因相同、凡不中病根之任何行爲、不能爲穩健之救濟、如有討論銀價之國際會議、則不若兼顧目前世界不景氣中其他各種原因之國際會議、更有價値於世界也、</p>
<h3>日樞府修正選舉法改正案</h3>
<p>剥奪學生選舉權</p>
<p>文部省表示反對</p>
<p>▲電通社一日東京電　選舉法中改正法律案、昨樞府精查委員會修正如下、第一、（甲）選舉權者年齡、政府提案爲二十歲、修正爲二十三歲、（乙）學生與陸海軍人之現役者及戰爭事變召集中者、不賦與選舉權、第二、缺格條項中、關於刑餘者、按其罪狀分定如下、（甲）服六年以上刑期者、終身無選舉權、（乙）非犯喪廉恥罪者、刑期滿後卽有選舉權、（丙）服六年以下刑期者、刑期滿後、須再經三年方有選舉權、第三、破産者及貧寒受公私扶助者、仍照原案有選舉權、第四、關於罰則條項、再改嚴格、右修正案中第一之（乙）條、剥奪學生選舉權、等於剥奪學生由現行法所得旣得權、最可注目、</p>
<p>▲電通社一日東京電　樞府對選舉法中改正法律案修正理由言曰、不賦與學生以選舉權者、乃將政府所主張選舉年齡二十歲、及樞密院所主張之二十五歲折衷爲二十三歲之妥協條件、政府當局對於審查普選案當時樞府特别上奏之教育設施、自實施普選以來、絶未實行、故樞府方面對於最近學校風潮及學生思想問題等、加以考慮、乃决定不賦與學生以選舉權、政黨弊害而波及學生、爲帝國將來計、實爲可慮、故對於此點、應須照樞府所修正云云、頗持强硬態度、固執修正案、</p>
<p>▲電通社一日東京電　選舉法改正　之樞府修正案、不承認學生選舉權、各方面成爲問題、尤以二十五歲以上學生、等於被剥奪由現行法所得旣得權、故内務文部兩省與黨少壯派等、皆反對樞府修正、文部省更認爲事態重大、於昨夕六時開首腦部會議、協議應付、以二十歲以上學生大半爲大學生、固須行公民教育、但毫無剥奪選舉權必要、樞府似以少年學生參加選舉運動爲憂、惟賦與選舉權及參加選舉運動、係另一問題、對於參加實際運動乃所不許、將於樞府正式會議聲辯、惟本屆議會祗餘十八日、再扣除休息日、祗有十四日、貴院自始卽反對政府改正案、難免相當糾紛、故選舉法改正案、能否通過本屆議會、殊無把握、</p>

<h3>鐵道部</h3>
<p>對商運會議之提案</p>
<p>鐵道部以國有各路前在軍事時期、積弊甚多、各路駐軍多擅扣車輛、自由擇縱、或與路上員司串同舞弊、任意勒索、以致路商兩方交困、在軍事時期、鐵道部雖有淸理積弊之心、而事實上困難甚多、現在軍事告終、火局敉平、此種積弊、亟應剔除、以蘇民困而維路政、特定三月一日召集商運會議、討論整頓路運、淸除積弊方法、决於會議閉幕之後、即切實辦理、茲錄鐵部對商運會議之提案如下、</p>
<p>（一）擬　切實整頓路務及商運案　查吾國鐵路已有六十餘年之歷史、其始以民智之閉塞、致鐵路之建築、　與而　輟、復以滿淸政府之腐敗、而築路之權多操於外人之手、自辛亥革命以後、又因頻年内戰不息、軍閥專權、致已成之鐵路亦日日瀕破産之境、迨國民政府成立之後、即設專部、以期責有專司、而其最大之目的、厥惟欲於訓政時期之中得以力圖整頓已成之　路、並建築已計劃之新路綫、俾得早日完成總理十萬英里鐵路之壯志、及供給國民之需要耳、故本部成立之後、即　專力先從事於整頓　路、乃其始也旣有寗漢之分立、　復有馮逆之稱兵、而主載又有圖逆之變叛、於是種種計劃均無一成、茲者訓政時期旣已開始、欲行初志、自以切實整頓各路路務及商運、爲不可或緩之要圖、惟吾國鐵路、因不良環境之影響、遂致時弊日深、運輸設備旣不甚完善、而路員舞弊亦在所不免、然路員舞弊、本部尙可詳查嚴懲、獨於間有劣商與路員朋比爲奸通同作弊之時、殊難澈底根究、故於各路機車車輛旣經淸理或補充之後、並由本部釐訂路員服務規章之外、首應杜絶劣商把持及路員舞弊之事、擬　先行取締各路承包貨運之轉運公司、俾得革除把持車輛及劣商與路員朋比爲奸之弊、是否有當、理合提出大會公决、</p>
<p>（二）貨運負責案查國有各路對於貨車運輸負責情形、多不一致、有絶對不負責任者、如津浦平漢等路是也、有名義上不負責任、而實際負責者、如京滬滬杭　　濟等路是也、有絶對負責者、如北寗四洮等路是也、考貨運保險事業、在上海有商家組織公司、負責承保、所收費用、雖易燃物品、如棉花之類、僅取千分之二、衡之北寗等路照普通　價加收一成、（即百分之十）相差百分之九十八、商家對於路局所訂之保險費、認爲成本負擔太重、故多裹足不前、此項收費負責之規定、等於虚設、現在國有各路均告統一、且京滬滬杭　路提案請修改運輸通則貨主自行負責之規定、是鐵路負責運輸商貨、自屬切要之圖、若照北寗四洮等路貨車運輸負責通則所規定之費、按普通運價數收百分之十、似覺過重、擬照上海商家組織公司取費千分之二之辦法、</p>
<p>由本部委託商家組織鐵路貨運保險公司、負責保險、按千分之二徴收費用、另由路局加收百分之一、爲所需蓬布繩索之用、凡國有各路一律照辦、蓋此種辦法、一舉三善、在商家出此小費、而货物可獲安全、在路局得維路　、且有保險公司負責、可免賠償之失、在公司有大批生意可作、自能發展商業、於路於商均有　益、擬請將此項辦法提出商運會議或運輸會議議决施行、</p>
<p>（三）擬創辦水陸聯　以便商旅　　查鐵路聯運自開辦以來、迄今已十餘年、商旅稱便、我國地大物博、人烟稠密、客貨運輸、均極　重、非辦理水陸聯運、不足以應需要、例如中日聯運及亞美聯運、皆有輪船公司加入在内、以資聯絡、而國内之水陸聯運、需要倍切、雖疊經提議猶未舉辦、殊屬遺憾、擬　大會議定鐵路與輪船公司聯合辦理水陸聯運、其詳細辦法、俟由聯運會議决定、呈請本部核定施行、是否有當、伏祈公决、（四）請將普通貨物表加以修改　　遺漏物品案查普通貨物分等表、物品分門别類、訂定等級、可謂完備、然因工商業之發達、物品出産日新月異、難免無遺漏之處、又以本國近年戰事之影響、及外貨之競爭、本部爲提倡實業起見、頗多將原定等級核减、且時有各路來呈請示解釋、以憑按等收費等事、茲爲各路貨站員司及貨商便於審查物品等級規定、並訂定整個貨物分等表起見、擬請將普通貨物分等表加以修改、並添註遺漏物品、是否有當、理合懇請提交大會公决、（五）請將各路貨運特價或專價加以審查而免分歧案　查國有鐵路各有貨運特價或專價之訂定、其旨無非爲振興實業、維持民食、利用回空車輛之足餓、或因軍事之關係、而議　此項辦法、原爲暫時補救之策、惟歷年旣久、各路之特價或專價、名目繁多、而致分歧、於運輸原則上不無背理之處、際此國事平靖、全國鐵路次第恢復原狀、此項特價或專價　多不合、且於貨物分　表貨車運輸原則均有　　、亦有特價之訂定、專爲一二公司者、其他同業公司不得享受、此種非公開之特價、不無偏見、故時有貨商來呈懇請本部援例核减運費等事、茲　整理貨貿收費及免除分歧起見、擬請將各路之貨運特價或專加價以審查、藉茲整頓、是否有當、理合懇請提交大會公决、</p>

<h3>濟南歸來　俞劍華</h3>
<p>濟南當南北之衝。有山水之勝。本極富庶。惜近年來受軍事影響。遭强鄰蹂躪。以致商業蕭條。民生凋敝。偶一歸省。不免有今昔山河之感。客歲夏日來南時。尚爲晋軍所據。一切毫無秩序。不久卽爲國軍克復。庚午歲杪。返籍省親。觀感所及。頗有淸新氣象。拉雜記之。以實本談。</p>
<p>主席韓復榘本軍人之規律。運政治之手腕。雖未能盡如人意。然能勵精圖治。不辭勞瘁。整飭官方。約束軍隊。使地方稍安。閭閻無驚。則殊有足多者。且追悼陣亡將士則親自御靈。視察各所公務。則自踏脚車。凡屬公務人員、一律靑布制服</p>
<h3>海外情塲的慘劇　·蔣·雅·英</h3>
<p>捷克有兩少女。友誼頗篤。日共寢食。出入必偕。近忽同戀一美少年。名葛丁鼐者。捷克政府之官吏也。而少年亦熟戀兩女。愛情程度。亦無分軒輊。若娶甲女則捨不得乙。娶乙女則捨不得甲。若同娶兩女。則又限於法律。而兩女表面上雖俱願退讓。以成人之美事。實際上則均不願讓步。以犧牲自己之幸福。然兩女雖處情敵地位。友誼則依然良好。於是一幕悲劇。因此而産生矣。</p>
<p>某日三人公開討論。兩女自請同處死刑。謂與其受精神上之痛苦。無寗一死之爲愈。少年無奈。遂表同情。相將至齊白山覓死。途中入中旅社狂歡。聚餐、</p>
<p>方畢。繼以歌舞。入夜始造山巓。兩女爭請先死。斯時三人擁抱大哭。少年神志已昏。遂發槍死其一。乙女奪槍謀自殺。少年復擊殺之。旋下山投警局自首焉。庭審之日。觀者如堵。捷克政府特下令。女推事禁止參加。蓋因葛丁鼐貌若潘安。女子見之生愛。恐女推事輩。或有袒護之行爲也。是日審判結果。僅處徒刑十年。然以殺兩人之罪而論。可謂輕中之又輕者矣。</p>
<p>。並無階級。尤具平等思想。鑒於五三慘案。遂實行拆城。今西門已去。昔之擁擠不堪者。今則馳驅裕如矣。歷城監獄自司法獨立後。久已無用。今亦拆除之。改爲民衆體育塲。省教育會改爲民衆劇塲。圖書館亦革新辦法。增加新舊書籍。不收門券。故讀書者甚多。不似以前之闃無一人矣。社會方面初時離婚案件極多。婦女協會。幾無餘晷。後有一强悍婦人。要求離婚。被主席鞭打。而離婚之風頓息。廢歷新年照常辦公。毫無通融。除夕一無鞭炮之聲。但商家休業。居民賀年。則亦不加禁止。濟南市興。歷城縣爲劃界交涉。糾纒甚久。後經財政局長趙星海師竭力請求。始將市區縮小。交界甫定。而市已取消矣。</p>
<h3>樂淸發見古墓記　周礪夫</h3>
<p>浙江樂淸黄塘之東山。質多黄土。凡附近之人。每有工作。必向該山取土應用。積年旣久。勢甚陂陀。而黄土罄焉。本年二月一日。山之南麓發見古墓（是否古墓待證）一所。墓口僅可容人。履其中。高約丈許。寬約七八尺。長與高等。上下四圍均以長方專甎砌成。下平而上成半環形。人在其中。空響内貯。醫欬不得他逸。甎長約一尺餘。闊半之。厚約二寸而弱。邊鐫永和十年太歲甲寅八月。及永和十一年七月日作等字樣間有刻龍鳳或卍字者。考吾國古帝王以永和紀元者。不一而足。若就甲寅二字論。與蘭亭集序之癸丑。後先相符。則此墓似爲晋代所建。若後秦。若北凉。（後秦姚泓北凉沮渠牧犍均稱永和）其勢力咸偏在西北一隅。樂爲彈丸小邑、僻處東南。未必奉其正朔。至於後漢。（後漢順帝亦稱永和）去古未遠。其字體非篆卽隸。（後漢王次仲始以隷書作楷法稱曰楷隷）甎刻純係楷書。且字法淺俗。不類古作。則其非順帝之永和。可無疑義。當此墓發見之日。遠近聞訊聚觀者。不可僂指計。余亦親往探視。故一切情形。得以詳悉。此種古蹟。理宜保留。無如參觀者。爭欲得甎以作紀念。撈掘不遺餘力。最後甎盡。而發見古磁數事。一爲溺器。色淡綠。形如獅。而製法特工。一爲筆洗及古碗等。又有銀鐵數事。已腐爛、余旣痛惜其原狀不能保存。乃轉向鄉人處丐得完磚一方。盛之以函。略記發見之情形。以供考古家之研索云耳。</p>
<h3>滑稽預測　費文寳</h3>
<p>▲第二次世界大戰後之中國</p>
<p>金價上騰、失業增多。全世界商業之衰落。南歐洲風雲之險惡。皆有造盛大戰之可能。德人羅登道夫。曾發表一文。對於二次歐戰之動機。爆發之日期。戰後之情形。皆有詳密之預測。惟此次戰後。中國之情狀地位。究竟如何。鄙人不敏。特作下列之預測</p>
<p>（一）廢除不平等條約收回租界　在滿淸帝制時代。總理以一平民。力主推翻滿淸結果帝制覆没。民國成立。在吳佩孚極盛時代。虎倡言北伐。結果北伐勝利。統一告成。現處列强壓迫下之中國。照弱國無外交之例。欲廢作不平等條約。勢似不能。惟老子云。强梁者不得其死。死次大戰。列强自相火併。自顧不暇。不平等條約。到此自動取消。而租界亦同時收回。租界地價。或將大跌。資本家所造房屋。空關加多。必有自動减租。招請房客之一日。虎之平均地權。節制資本之說。亦將實現</p>
<p>（二）僱工建設佈種西北　中國人向有大老官脾氣。對於物質上之需要。祗知應用。不知發明。此次戰後。所有各國大發明家工程家。因經濟不寗。相率東游謀食。中國將延之爲建設一切之顧問。同時戰後。死亡過多。歐洲女多於男數倍。中國將有大批男子。出洋佈種。西人所謂黄禍。實係黄父之誤。謂予不信。請看將來（却酬）</p>
<h3>難能可貴之小學生　才良</h3>
<p>予友黄君。執教潛溪。日前以事過敝廬晤談之下。渠爲予述該校一小　　學生工讀事頗趣。爰誌之。藉以風世。</p>
<p>學生徐姓　兆瑞其名。年纔十二。性好學。每試輙冠儕輩。奈困於家境。時作時輟。蓋渠家祇有一老父。日賴渠賣糕以爲活。故其來學也。必在上午。下午則肩負竹籠。徘徊街巷。高呼賣糕。雖風雨無間。復以其善伺人意。故生涯特盛。時或一卷在手。伏坐街頭。隨地吟哦。爲狀至樂。及狀歸。則必購甘旨以奉其親。骨肉團聚。其樂固融融如也。予以其養親似子路。好學如承宫、乃名之曰模範小學生。時以爲諸生　焉。</p>
<p>才良曰。小學生能自食其力。苦行工讀。事雖可憫。實屬可敬。以視今之一般紈袴子弟。衣錦繡。食膏粱。而揮金如土。不知讀書爲何物者。賢不肖相去遠矣。</p>
<h3>離魂新誌　儉文</h3>
<p>太和周翁。淸明經。家道小康。年逾耳</p>
<p>順。性迂戇。世居太和之西鄉。太和素多匪患。而以西鄉爲尤甚。鄉民稍有資蓄者。多移居城内。藉避匪燄。翁曰。盜亦有道也。彼以强暴。我以仁義。無不格化者。終不移。人笑其迂。弗顧也。一夕。匪果光臨。翁開門。擬揖之人。匪疑有備。饗以彈。翁應聲而倒。家人均逃避。匪飽掠而去。翌晨。家人歸。見翁已死。雖傷其非命。而咎由自取。遂付窀窆。詎翁飲彈之時。適白下張姓子。年甫九齡。病劇昏厥。夜半始蘇。或指張夫婦。令其辨認。以省神智。答曰。吾被匪擊。何以不死。聆其聲。如成人。張疑其囈語。轉誣之。遂歷述家世。與遇匪情形。則周翁之前生也。翁固工書畫。授以不律。落紙揮毫　烟雲生肘腕問。張怪之。始應其請挈之返和。覘究意。翁抵家。詳述其子女姓時。及遇匪被戕顚末。不爽毫泰。家人均驚泣環拜。張始嘆服。自此兩姓過從頗密。亳州朱營長席珍。曾目擊。奇其事。用告記者。特誌之。以告世之留心靈魂學者。</p>
<h3>南洋遊記（一二七）　靈花</h3>
<p>陳翁欲實騐其計劃。以十萬元爲試騐。在瓦城南某地聚民而行之數年。失敗。其財銷失。聞其原因。乃陳翁章程。凡工作者以三分之一歸公。而來者目的在營利養家。不肯歸公。以致人散去也。但陳翁於失敗後。畢生積蓄十萬金。一旦蕩然。見人毫無悔吝。一笑而已。彼以一字不識之人。而有柏拉圖理想國之思想。亦可謂偉人也。陳翁失敗後。捲土重來。彼善營業。復在山鄉養猪難二三年。又得三四萬金。家賴小康。不幸於去年忽遇八緬匪。持槍刦之。受傷而亡。蓋緬人妬華人有財。如中人視歐人在華也。但陳翁經營新村。遺跡尚可尋云。余按古來凡營新村者多失敗。其故多因重視人之善性。而亡人之惡性。視人也太高。不知人之私利性與生俱來。不易破除也。佘比較及經騐判斷人性。善好惡多。善有二三。而惡有六七。此古來所以治日少而亂日多。余從實際上觀破人類社會。敢斷言者。社會有組織。人類無平等也。此言我斷爲鐵律矣。或曰。子多年習託爾士太與克魯池金之學。認爲經典。何爲此言。曰彼之言仁人之願也。可以爲教化。可以爲幾何學之定理。以資應用耳。若眞執幾何學之定理以求實現。蓋未易立見也。人生誠多矛盾之點。不可不知耳。至陳翁之公衆生活稿。蓮靑有之。俟查出以備研究。其功不可没也。聞陳翁持之堅。以爲如用其說。政府可不用。昔曾熱心欲陳請於政府。求其推行。惜乎我若早一年來。尚及晤之也。至其新村雖失敗。尚不失爲新村史中偉人。較以十萬遺子孫之守財奴。價値一萬倍以上。而我主張新村須普遍建設。如提倡學校。然偶有失敗。亦如某店舖關門。乃商家常事。不足計也。</p>
<p>五日晨四時。乘小船回渺湼。價十二安。卽銅子四十八枚。下午二時回勃生。六時到。</p>
<p>六日。近心力頗弱。忽讀屠格湼夫之詩。Ｔurgenell心神大好。自五日至七日三天。爲緬人燈火節。卽雨季終了入乾季之節。緬人舉行燈火會。滿街掛燈。略如我之元宵燈節。但我有馬兎等燈。花色甚多。緬人太老實。花色少耳。緬各大小市均有大光塔。卽廟也。</p>

<p>社會消息</p>
<h3>閩南的天地人　春苔</h3>
<p>厦門通信</p>
<p>（一）何謂厦門</p>
<p>厦門不是一頭什麽門、</p>
<p>這個聲明、似乎比「上海確實像一個海」的聲明、更有必要、厦門是一個島、我一直到這裏來以後始知道、</p>
<p>我以前所曉得關於厦門者有兩件事、第一、開陳嘉庚橡皮鞋公司的老班、私人辦了一個厦門大學、第二、厦門街市之齷齪稱爲天下第一、現在到了這裏、知道這兩件事中很有可做的文章、而這兩件事以外、更有很多很多的價値、爲大家所未曾提及的、</p>
<p>這個海島、生得好地位、第一是生在温暖人家、上海人北平人穿了兩三重棉襖皮襖還凌凌的發抖、而厦門人呢、說句愛國的話、穿件紡綢單衫、還是爲了提倡國貨、給綢緞業同胞撑點門面之意、如果不想維持中國五千年文物之邦的禮教、在厦門赤膊是不必吃重價錢的阿斯匹靈的、愛國話話過、就要說時髦話了、在厦門、通商大埠、閩南咽喉、漂亮人物、自然都是西裝、他們是美國式雪白的翻領襯衫、穿得個個像要上網球塲去的模樣、</p>
<p>雖然海風來時也須穿一件棉襖、但一切景物、都如江南的桂花時節、桂花是滿樹花朶、不必說了、傘蓋形的大榕樹濃綠多蔭、還有龍眼樹荔枝樹、東一叢、西一叢、預備放出花球、最可愛的是枝枝桃花與梅花同時開放、在家家院前探出頭來、雖然是巖塊堆壘的石島、點綴得使春光永留不走、</p>
<p>厦門與鼓浪嶼只隔一條海峽、鼓浪嶼還是租界性質、因此外國時髦上可以與上海比賽、從厦門坐小汽船一小時、或坐汽車四十分鐘、再渡海峽、可達集美、這是大陸上伸出的半島、卽陳嘉庚先生的故鄉、他所辦集美學校在焉、從集美坐汽車向西南行、通泉州、從厦門渡海向西北行、通漳州、厦門是閩南交通中心、還有大小商輪直接與上海、温州、福州、台灣、汕頭、香港、廣州等巨埠交通、</p>
<p>厦門潮的漲落高度達二十六尺之多、雖没有浙江潮之成莊觀、甚且毫無波動、只是暗漲暗退、但其高下相差之大爲世界第一、這海港中的魚類是很豐富的、</p>
<p>至於天下第一齷齪的資格、大有取銷的趨勢了、原來在山島上築城、自然是忽高忽低、一轉一折、没有什麽平直的道路、現在有一條長濶的中山路、十分模倣平原上大城市的規模、把高起的都削平、所以馬路兩面便成了兩行黄泥的剖面、而原有的交叉街道、高高的擱在這兩面的黄泥山上、如要交通、須從這街頭的梯子裏走下來穿過中山大馬路、再從對面的梯子爬上去、到那邊的一段、現在看這種小道、幾乎兩人不好並行、倒也有别種意義、</p>
<p>厦門全島、在行政上爲思明縣、「厦門」只是習慣上的名稱而已、近思明縣商會呈請指委會、其文曰、「竊厦門樞紐閩南各縣、抗衡南洋羣島、爲閩南商業之總匯、商會之設立、至關重要、此次南洋商業、雜貨業、麫粉業、海産業、糖油業、綢布業、火柴業、西藥業、及錢莊業等同業公會、遵照商會法及人民團體設立程序、發起組織厦門商會名稱改爲思明縣商會、當經該發起團體、……深切考慮、愼重討論、僉以厦門名稱、具有攸遠之歷史、國内外人士、多知有厦門、而不知有思明、……應由籌備委員會呈請思明縣黨務指導委員會……准思明縣商會名稱、改爲厦門商會、」</p>
<p>閩南盜匪、時有所聞、報紙上亦每天有剿匪輿被匪綁去幾人的消息、至於閩西一帶、與江西毘連　連受共黨之害甚深、有閩南社隨軍記者的通信、謂閩西各縣按戸勒繳現洋、換其永遠不能兌現的農工銀行紙幣、</p>
<p>近來南洋中國商人經營多不順利、故欲歸國經商者甚多、但以回國者屢被綁票之故、不敢回來、否則厦門市面將更加發達、</p>
<p>然而厦門全島及泉漳城鎭都是平安可居的、我想在這通信中隨時表彰一點閩南的天地人、</p>
<p>（二）忌諱日</p>
<p>厦門各報登載一段新聞、謂黨政警開聯席會議、議决如下、甲、令商會籌委會轉知各同業公會及商店、於廢曆新年前後、一律不得休業、乙、令各保自治聯合會、轉飭各分會、轉知各住戸、不得慶祝慶曆新年、丙、函知各機關團體學校、於廢曆元旦、應照常辦公式上課、不得放假、丁、如有違背上項辦法者、應分别呈報上級機關處分、或拘送公安局嚴辦、并組織視察隊三隊、分途視察、其餘條文尚多、不及備載、</p>
<p>可是、還没有到這忌諱的一天、人們忙碌的籌備、門上貼起新寫的紅紙對聯、「帝德乾坤大、皇恩雨露深、」雖然窮苦破爛的矮屋上、也有紅紙横條曰「讀古人書」而左右一聯曰、「瑞日芝蘭光甲第、春風棠棣振家聲、」眞是書香滿屋、林語堂先生所謂「卽使心理、邏輯、經濟政治都不及格、也已不愧爲一位讀書人」也、</p>
<p>連日來視察隊在街上遇售賣春聯者卽趕前撕毁、而結果還是滿街貼得紅紅的、厦門不愧爲林先生的故鄉、愛書香過於生命、可是、過年可以禁止、吃肉穿新衣是無法禁止的、到了這忌諱的一天、滿街的人穿了新衣遊逛、國歷元旦的一天、嚴令店舖閉門、派警隊往查、查到一個小皮匠門前、他回答說、「我只有這半間店面、關起店門、一點光亮都没有了、」今天、這小皮鞋匠門前也是一把大鎖擋駕、滿街都鎖了門去遊狂、視察隊也惟有盡職視察而已、</p>
<p>福建的鞭砲是有名的、前幾天夜間聽到幾聲、爲是對盜示威的槍聲、很覺驚奇、因這鞭砲都是單聲、而本地各家常備槍枝自衞、有時開放示威、近日晝夜不斷的聽到這種槍聲、就不以爲意了、</p>
<p>只要這天一過、一切現象漸漸的可以消滅、獨黨政警聯席會議仍然稱這二月十七日爲元旦、雖然冠以廢曆二字、仍不免示人口實、可見習俗之難移也、因此、名這一日爲忌諱日、</p>

<p>靑年園地</p>
<h3>平民夜校　英</h3>
<p>跑出校門打算到田間去散散步、無意中看見一大堆人圍着看一張佈告、唯一的空缺給一個黄包車夫搶過去補滿了、我看他的眼並没有注意那貼在壁上的佈告、好像是在研究前面遽去他視線的那個秃頭、最後他彷彿看夠了似的、嘻嘻抽退了出來、</p>
<p>媽媽……車夫一頭說、一頭拿塊靑色的布揩着臉上的汗、用著一隻眼睛呆看着那秃頭、我就趁機替他補了那個空位、我默默地看着、</p>
<p>「竊維立國之本、爲教育、教育普及、則民智自開、……數年以來、集資任課、希望甚殷……」</p>
<p>我覺得面前一亮、秃頭已經喃喃地退了出來了、雖然我尚未看完、但我已明白了、無疑的、這定是學生會的平民夜校招生佈告、</p>
<p>不錯讀書求學在中國目今幾乎變爲中上階級專利的事了、貧窮的人家、誰有力栽培讀書子弟呢、連年内亂的結果「窮」字在中國比教育普遍得多、實在是可痛心的事、半工半讀、國内實少有此種學校之建設、至於夜校、都市中是有的、但是只有都市的人們能夠享受、况且高貴的費用、也不是貧窮的父母所能供給子女的、</p>
<p>我們學校、臨近的貧民很多、乾脆的說、不識字的人多、無知識的人多、辦平民夜校、灌輸給他們知識和學問、確是很急切而緊要的事、</p>
<p>平民夜校開辦成立、至今已有好幾年的歷史了、去年的一個晚上、我曾去看過他們的上課、大概有一百多人、分三班、學生的年齡有出奇的不整齊、大略地說、從五六歲的到二十五六歲、在一個課堂上課、是一件很平常的事、</p>
<p>所有一切的用費、都由自治會拿出錢來購置、學費不收、先生呢、是我們幾位熱心的同學做的、白天他們自己是學生、晚上在原來授課的課堂中教書了、到是很有趣的事、</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>有一天、平民夜校内服務的西君笑着對我說、「明天我們考代數、要預備預備、請你今晚把我代一點鐘的課、」</p>
<p>一對不起、上起台來紅臉、不是生意經、」我慌忙推辭、</p>
<p>「不要緊、不過臭一點、」</p>
<p>「你的話什麽意思、」我問、</p>
<p>他們身上太　、一生恐怕只洗三回澡、</p>
<p>三回、那你眞是形容過度、</p>
<p>怎麽不是、生下地一回、娶親的前一夜洗一回、洗屍一回、足足三回、</p>
<p>我也開玩笑地說、一先生快點上課去、教育的洗禮實在比任何來得緊要、先生要人代課、學生不可請人代聽麽、</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>西在同學中是善於吵閙的人、但是他一上了講台、作起先生來、就換過一個人了、</p>
<p>「不准吵、」他常常在嘴甲發出這恐嚇式的命令式的聲浪給台下的學生、他教書的精神並不似自己作學生時一般的萎頓、書上的圖畫、往往要給他形容得跑了出來似的、</p>
<p>我佩服他、但我終於領悟到人生一舉一動的矛盾了、</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>平民夜校在放學前四星期、卽行結束了、成績很能使人滿意、</p>
<p>中國的教育太了普及了、中國貧苦的靑年太多了、他們實在太不幸、這種的挽救方法、當然是有良好效力的、我很希望大家仿效着作去、</p>
<p>靑年們、努力吧、光明就在前頭期待着我們了、</p>
<h3>朝會　蔣山靑</h3>
<p>每天八點半鐘、全體的同學都要在大禮堂裏舉行朝會、朝會是藉以報告重大的事體聯絡師生的感情、增進同學的友誼、激勵求學的勤奮的一個機會、每天由級任長主任老師輪流做主席的、今天輪到了孔老師、</p>
<p>他首先解釋朝會的意義、於是提出訓育上中心訓練遇的辦法向我們報告、就是實行「怎樣做模範學生」的條文、所謂怎樣做模範學生的條文、正是中心訓練的一種具體方法、每週提出一個切要的目標、譬如秩序是初開學時最不容易整飭的、現在便先做秩序週、拿「秩序」做爲本週訓練的中心、同時印發了許多關於秩序的事項編成了簡要的條文、要仔孧地隨時注意遵守着做去、有違犯了的、由同學檢舉便在教室裏的索引表上按照一所違犯條文、在某人姓名一欄、書上一個「？」的符號、一方面可以促使違犯者的警醒、一方面可以統計同學的性行、做各級的比較、</p>
<p>我覺得這些條文、都很與我們有益、我的朋友、所以我現在抄來給你、要你和我同時地修養、各各做模範的學生、</p>
<p>孔老師接着便仔細解釋這秩序週的條文、</p>
<p>一、我每日來校、用的東西都帶齊、</p>
<p>二、我走路靠左、</p>
<p>三、我横過馬路、先左右看一看</p>
<p>四、我排隊時安靜、整齊、輕快、</p>
<p>五、我說笑都安守、不妨礙他人的做事、</p>
<p>六、我上課時、不玩别的東西、不做别的事情、</p>
<p>七、我上課時要說話先舉手、</p>
<p>八、我安放各種用具有一定的位置、</p>
<p>九、我離開先生也靜守秩序、</p>
<p>十、我離開座位把桌椅安放好、</p>
<p>十一、我準時到校、回家、赴約會、集會、</p>
<p>交宿題、</p>
<p>十二、我不沿途吃東西、</p>
<p>十三、我進出教室走路都輕快、不搶先、</p>
<p>十四、我輕輕地開門關門、</p>
<p>十五、我聽得各種信號立刻遵行、</p>
<p>十六、我不獨佔公共游戯的器具、</p>
<p>十七、我用公共的器具不搶先、用畢送還原處</p>
<p>十八、我不通過禁止通行的地方、</p>
<p>十九、我在開會時遵守會塲規章、服從多數人的意見、</p>
<p>二十、我在人多時不故意擠軋、</p>
<p>二十一、我盡力維持全校會秩序、</p>
<p>二十二、我離開先生父母也靜守秩序、</p>
<p>二十三、我無迫切理由、不打斷人家的說話、</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<p>日本侵略下之滿蒙　南心</p>
<p>石明著</p>
<p>日本的侵略我國、誰也曉得、是已有三十餘年歷史、但其耽視之點、尤爲滿蒙山東等處、滿蒙又因爲地理上與歷史上的關係、所受之禍更爲酷烈、自甲午中日一役以到現在、日本對滿蒙的侵略、是無所不用它底野心、卽使東北半壁、差不多全操於日人掌握之中、在不久之前、更有所謂新滿蒙政策者、積極决定對滿蒙作進一步的侵略、它所特具的野心、實和企圖已亡底朝鮮之域一樣、此後、又有濟案的發生、國人對於日人無有不痛憤莫狀、然而欲向日本侵略我國的實狀、則恐大多數的國民、猶多未能完全瞭然的、同時、類於此項的專著、在坊間亦不多見、因爲國人專心研究此等問題者實少、外人之侵略滿蒙、是暗面裏在進行着他們的野心、並不是以劇烈的戰鬬來奪掠、所以不易引起國人分外底注意、藉以窺見日人侵略的整個的内幕、坊間在不久之前、出版了這一本所謂「日本侵略下之滿蒙」一書、它底内容、頗爲詳細、不但將日本侵略滿蒙的歷史現况、加以詳述、而且將有關滿蒙種種重要的問題、都作有糸統的解說、石君所編此書、據序中言是得以喚起國人的分外注意、爲謀所謂「還我山河」之幸、同時、亦爲留心滿蒙問題者及日帝國主義的野心者的參閱、</p>
<p>全書計分九章、將日人對滿蒙侵略之野心都暴露無餘、實堪我們加以閱讀的、（一）滿蒙的地位及其與日本的關係、（二）日本侵略滿蒙的歷史、（三）日本在滿蒙的政治軍事勢力、（四）日本在滿蒙的經濟侵略一、（鐵路侵略與滿鐵會社）、（五）日本在滿蒙的經濟侵略二、（礦産·工商業·農林·森林·航權·郵電·漁業等的侵略、）（六）日本在滿蒙的文化侵略、（七）日本在滿蒙的殖民政策、（八）日本最近侵略滿蒙的隂謀及事實、（九）結論現將其内容加以簡略的叙述、</p>
<p>日本之所以侵略滿蒙、我們如果要明白其整個的根源、那非由其地理與歷史的兩方面加以考察、作者石君也注意到這一點、所以在本書的起首、旣述滿蒙的地位如何、同時、它與日本有何重大的關係、這亦是我們所急須知道的、因爲我們對於滿蒙的範圍、地位、與其重要等等如有一鮮明的輪廓、那麽其它關於滿蒙一切的眞相都易於明瞭了、所謂滿、卽指滿洲（Ｍanchuria）而言、它包括奉天·吉林·黑龍江三省、日人分之爲南滿北滿、幅員之廣、較之豫·鄂·湘·贛·皖五省的總面積、尤有過之、蒙古原分爲内外蒙古、但日本人因其侵略的目的而有東蒙西蒙之稱、滿蒙的面積旣廣、可耕之地亦甚多、誠爲一個極大的富源、據日人確實之調查、除了豐滿的農産物之外、還有大量牲畜生産、這眞是國家富源之寳藏、在産量方面、本書中列有詳表、足供我們之參考、由此看來、滿蒙現操入日人和同一野心勃勃的俄帝國主義者之手、是多麽引爲痛心的事、無異於我國的唯一的財富被日人掠奪去了、</p>
<p>在地勢上、滿洲是當黑龍江流域、卽爲中國四大流域之一、所以水利甚爲佳善、運輸滿灌溉、没有一種不適宜的、滿蒙出産之富、也可以說是天生財源之厚於此可知梗概、其中還有未能盡行開闢、倘若完全墾拓、其收獲之前途、當無可限量、那麽、引起日帝國主義的所以爲之埀涎三尺、也是必然的原因、（一）地理的接壤、滿洲地連朝鮮、隔日本海與日本相對因地理上的關係、所以日人易於伸張它底勢力、（二）日本最恐慌的是兩大問題、卽日本一國、人口激增、食糧缺乏、故該國之人無有不焦慮喧呶於此的、（三）工業原料之缺乏、因爲日本國土狹小、出産貧弱、鐵·煤·油·棉花·羊毛等等的缺乏、皆仰他國之供給、這滿蒙一大出産地能劃入日本經濟圈内、自可彌補它底缺恨、不僅原料問題可以得到美滿的解决、卽日貨的銷塲、與滿蒙的關係亦大、（四）國防問題、滿蒙介於中俄日三國之間、國際關係甚爲複雜、所以此處不但使日本引起埀涎三尺、然亦可使所謂共産國度的俄羅斯大伸其侵略的野心、以此四端、實爲日本侵略滿蒙的主要原因、在我們留意滿蒙問題的、非先明白其侵略的主因不可、關於此、作者在本書裏是說得非常的詳細、足以作研究地理之學者參考上的一助、</p>
<p>其次、我們急須明白的是日本侵略滿蒙的歷史、這一點、其它的歷史專著上當然也有記載、但是嘗有不能詳盡的缺陷、作者在本書裏、將日本與我國所訂之侵略條約、分别言之、使我們一讀瞭然、如馬開條約、退還遼東、中俄密約、俄國的肆行侵略滿蒙、日戰之戰、朴次茅斯條約、中日滿洲善後條約、滿鐵會社及都督府之設立、鴨綠江森林問題及五懸案之解决、美國滿洲鐵路中立之提議及日俄聯合、滿蒙五鐵道權、廿一條約的關於滿蒙者、鄭家屯事件、段氏當國時期對滿蒙的投資、中日軍事協定之害、滿蒙除外之要求、旅大的抗不交還、以及日本的侵略野心等等、均分期叙述、（一）日本開始侵略滿洲時期、（二）俄國侵略滿蒙時期、（三）日本取得滿洲經濟政治的優越權利時期、（四）日本實行侵略滿蒙時期、（五）日本單獨恣意侵略滿蒙的時期、（六）最近日本企圖滿蒙的時期、我們總觀以上六點、可知日本實際佔領滿蒙之時期實距此不遠了、我國人士、對於此不知可作何感想呢、</p>
<p>實際上、我國東北西南的邊藩、已非我國所有、藏屬於英、外蒙由屬俄而獨立、滿洲内蒙、則在日人操縱之下、我們祗要看、日本侵略滿蒙的政治工具、條約上的政治優越權、四頭政治、以及日本在滿洲軍隊的編制及分配四要點、便能明白它在滿蒙内幕之一斑、日本在滿蒙的經濟侵略、其鐵路政策、如直接建築的鐵路、間接投資的鐵路、南滿鐵路的侵害國權、東印度公司之滿鐵會社、滿鐵的中心主義、其它在實業等等方面、則有日人獨辦及日人投資的礦業、煤鐵爲帝國主義的麵包、東亞拓殖公司、中國工業專有權的喪失、日本單獨經營的公司、中日合辦的公司、各地日本公司狀况、正金朝鮮銀行、農業機關、森林公司、日本的柞蠶業、航權喪失的由來及狀况、海底電線與無線電、郵電的壟斷、與漁利的喪失等、凡此種種、都是日本侵略滿蒙的整個的經濟計劃、我們閱讀書中所述、實有令人胆寒之處、因爲、這些關於國家生命的經濟命脈、都操縱在日人的手掌之中、將來很難使我國固有勢力之伸張、這關於國家强盛之前途、實至深且巨、本書將日人經營事業的各種收入等等、均列有詳表、使讀者閱之一目了然、中國財源之損失、實有莫過於此者、</p>
<p>日人對於滿蒙之隂謀當然還不止於此、但在本書裏、大者皆有詳述、它實憑藉不平等條約爲護符、爲根據、始得以彰明較著的以謀我國、中山先生謂不平等條約爲中國人的賣身契、實爲促醒國人之箴言、留心滿蒙問題、此書實値一讀、况作者所論都所正確、同時亦爲根據事實而言、是一本極好的歷史書、</p>

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<p>Henderson's Travel Negotiations</p>
<p>Britain and Italy Reach an Agreement</p>
<p>Italy Makes Major Concessions to France</p>
<p>Abandons Equality Demands</p>
<p>Agreement Contents Absolutely Not Announced</p>
<p>Five-Nation Naval Treaty Can Be Expected to Succeed</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Rome, 28th: British Foreign Secretary Henderson told reporters today that a compromise had been reached in principle with the Italian government. If things go smoothly in Paris as they did in Rome, an agreement can be reached. "In Paris, we have a very good prospect," he said. It seems that the elimination of the naval dispute between France and Italy and the joining of both countries in the London Naval Treaty can be regarded as an accomplished fact. Last night, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini attended a banquet held by the British Embassy to entertain British cabinet members. After the meal, the British Foreign Secretary and the Italian Prime Minister spoke for quite a long time. This morning, the British and Italian Foreign Secretaries and naval experts from both sides held formal meetings separately. After the British Foreign Secretary and the Naval Secretary met the Italian Empress, the British and Italian Foreign Secretaries conferred for a short time before a final agreement was reached. The Italian Foreign Secretary then went to the Prime Minister's residence to report everything to the Prime Minister, and then went to the British Embassy to issue a public announcement with the British Foreign Secretary announcing the satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations. According to British sources, the two British cabinet members were often in contact with Paris by telephone and telegram, so the terms of this agreement are well known to the French government. An hour later, the British Foreign Secretary and others set off for Paris, while the Italian Foreign Secretary and Naval Secretary waited at the station to see them off, all with happy faces. Apart from the public announcement, nothing is known about the nature of the naval agreement reached between Britain and Italy. The only news obtained is a rather vague announcement that the five-nation treaty can be expected to succeed. Italy feels that it is possible to make concessions, and this concession does not greatly contradict its previous attitude, but it still insists on its own needs in principle. Both Britain and Italy absolutely refuse to announce the tonnage of the most important part of the agreement. However, it is heard that the agreement is based on the principle of naval holiday. In fact, France and Italy may complete their warship construction for this year, but after that, from now until 1936, they will only replace old ships. In other words, in 1936, France will still have the naval superiority over Italy that it has today. From this, it can be seen that Italy has agreed to temporarily suspend its demand for naval equality between Italy and France before the 1936 naval conference. The Supreme Administrative Council of the Italian Fascist Party recently voted that Italy would never accept anything that was not equal to France. However, the Italian authorities have now agreed to temporarily not demand equality, so this can be regarded as a major concession on the part of Italy. However, France's naval superiority is almost entirely made up of old ships of questionable value. If new ships are considered, there is not much difference. Italian newspapers have adopted a cautious attitude because they have not seen the contents of the agreement, but they all express satisfaction with the elimination of the naval problem that has hindered Franco-Italian relations in the past year and hope that the current agreement can become a source of important international understanding. Italian Foreign Minister Grandi told people after the British cabinet members set off for France that he was satisfied with the results of this negotiation and said that "We have made great sacrifices, but for the sake of world peace, we have no choice but to do so." The British side also attaches great importance to the friendly and gentle spirit expressed by the Italian politicians during the negotiations. How long the British Foreign Secretary and others will stay in Paris will depend on their efforts to persuade the French government to agree to the few points that have not been resolved. However, the British Foreign Secretary said that he may be able to report the results of this trip to the cabinet and Parliament in London on Sunday, which suggests that the British cabinet members will not encounter any major obstacles in Paris.</p>
<p>▲ National Press, Paris, 28th: After the news that the British-Italian naval agreement was signed in Rome spread, political circles here regarded it as a great victory for France. All the evening newspapers used large headlines or phrases such as "The Cessation of the Naval Competition Between Italy and France" or "The End of February is a Great Commemoration in European History." However, due to the haste of time, the reporters have not yet made any comments. The public believes that since the reconciliation in Rome has been achieved, Britain and France will lend a large sum of money to Italy, and all disputes between France and Italy, such as the problems of the colonies, can also be solved easily. According to the Free Press, the reconciliation agreement in Rome stipulates: (1) The comparison of naval tonnage between France and Italy is based only on new warships, and the word "equality" is no longer used. (2) The agreement on the naval programs of the two countries is valid until 1936. (3) France has an advantage over Italy in a certain type of warship. (4) It is stated that this agreement shall not be used as the basis for another treaty, but should be used as the basis for Italy and France to join the London Naval Convention.</p>
<p>▲ National Press, Rome, 28th: All newspapers carried in large letters that when British Foreign Secretary Henderson was about to leave Rome for Paris, someone asked whether France's approval of the British-Italian naval agreement signed earlier was merely a formality and whether Italy's views would make it necessary for Britain and France to hold new negotiations. Henderson did not answer.</p>
<h3>All-India Congress Unhappy with Viceroy's Answer</h3>
<p>Three Preconditions</p>
<p>Completely Rejected</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, New Delhi, 28th: The All-India Congress Working Committee has firmly rejected the answer given by the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, during his talks with Gandhi. The reason why the All-India Congress made this decision is clearly because there are three major difficulties: (1) Impartial investigation of police misconduct, (2) Indians have the right to picket shops selling foreign cloth and alcohol, (3) Indians have the right to produce salt. The All-India Congress demanded these three things, but the authorities failed to acknowledge these preconditions for the truce.</p>
<h3>Saving the Falling Silver Price</h3>
<p>Cannot Achieve Results Through Isolated Action</p>
<p>Indian Finance Committee Expresses Opinions in the Legislative Council</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, New Delhi, 28th – The Indian government's Finance Committee member, Schuster, stated in the Legislative Council tonight that some have recently suggested that India should stop selling silver. However, with the continuous production of silver ore worldwide, this suggestion is absurd. The current silver price of six annas per ounce is very reasonable and will certainly not hinder the consumption of silver within India. Last year, he proposed that other countries related to silver should jointly maintain the world silver price. Unfortunately, only the American silver mining industry responded directly, and their proposed method was that if the production of new silver remained unlimited, the government's stored silver should not be sold. It is unlikely that the Legislative Council would want the Indian government to relinquish its rights and accept this one-sided agreement. The whole world regards India as a silver-consuming country. In the five years before the end of March 1930, India absorbed 10.08 million ounces of silver annually. Judging from this phenomenon, India's absorption this year should not be less than this amount, while the Indian government only sold 90 million ounces of its own stored silver. India must retain freedom of action. We must ask ourselves whether cooperation can achieve the desired goals. The more he studies this matter, the more he feels that the fall in silver prices cannot be solved by an isolated measure, and the more he believes that isolated actions cannot achieve results. Most metal prices have fallen, not limited to silver, and the reasons are the same. Any action that does not address the root cause cannot provide a sound remedy. If there is an international conference to discuss silver prices, it would be more valuable to the world if it also considered other causes of the current global recession.</p>
<h3>Japanese Privy Council Amends Election Law Amendment</h3>
<p>Depriving Students of the Right to Vote</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Expresses Opposition</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 1st – The amendment to the Election Law was revised by the Privy Council's review committee yesterday as follows: 1. (A) The age for voters, proposed by the government as 20 years old, was revised to 23 years old. (B) Students and active military personnel in the army and navy, as well as those mobilized for war or incidents, will not be granted the right to vote. 2. Regarding disqualification clauses, the following provisions are made regarding those with criminal records, based on the nature of their crimes: (A) Those serving prison sentences of six years or more will be permanently deprived of the right to vote. (B) Those who have not committed crimes involving moral turpitude will have the right to vote immediately after serving their sentence. (C) Those serving prison sentences of less than six years must wait another three years after serving their sentence to regain the right to vote. 3. Bankrupt individuals and those receiving public or private assistance due to poverty will still have the right to vote as originally proposed. 4. Regarding penalty clauses, stricter revisions have been made. Among the above amendments, Article 1 (B), which deprives students of the right to vote, is equivalent to depriving students of the vested rights obtained under the current law and is most noteworthy.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 1st – The Privy Council stated the reasons for amending the Election Law amendment, saying that not granting students the right to vote is a compromise condition to reconcile the government's proposed voting age of 20 and the Privy Council's proposed age of 25, setting it at 23. The government authorities, regarding the educational facilities specially reported by the Privy Council at the time of reviewing the universal suffrage proposal, have never implemented them since the implementation of universal suffrage. Therefore, the Privy Council, considering recent school disturbances and student ideological problems, has decided not to grant students the right to vote. The corruption of political parties and its impact on students is a concern for the future of the empire. Therefore, a firm stance should be taken on this point, following the Privy Council's amendment.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 1st – The Privy Council's amendment to the Election Law, which does not recognize students' right to vote, has become a problem in various aspects. In particular, students aged 25 and above are essentially being deprived of the vested rights obtained under the current law. Therefore, both the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Education, as well as the younger factions of the political parties, oppose the Privy Council's amendment. The Ministry of Education considers the situation serious and held a leadership meeting at 6 PM last night to discuss countermeasures. Most students aged 20 and above are university students, and civic education is necessary for them, but there is no need to deprive them of the right to vote. The Privy Council seems to be concerned about young students participating in election campaigns, but granting the right to vote and participating in election campaigns are two different issues. Participation in actual campaigns is not allowed and will be argued at the Privy Council's formal meeting. However, there are only eighteen days remaining in this session of the Diet, and subtracting rest days leaves only fourteen days. The House of Peers has opposed the government's amendment from the beginning, so considerable disputes are inevitable. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the Election Law amendment can be passed in this session of the Diet.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Ships Large Amounts of Cash to Germany</h3>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Berlin, February 28th – Another 8,000 kilograms of Russian cash (each kilogram weighing 2.25 English pounds) has been safely shipped to the German capital and immediately stored in the German National Bank. These gold bars are worth approximately 22 million marks. Including previous batches of cash shipped from Russia to Germany, the total value is about 80 million marks. Therefore, the reserves of the German National Bank are currently quite sufficient.</p>

<p>▲ The Chairman's Opening Speech: Briefly stated that the railway transportation is closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The development of production undertakings depends on the convenience of railway transportation. Since the establishment of the Ministry of Railways, for more than two years, due to financial difficulties, not only has new construction of national railways not been possible, but the original construction cannot be maintained. Recently, due to the impact of military affairs, the damage to railway affairs and the losses in business have been countless. The transportation capacity is decreasing daily. If reorganization is not urgently sought, the future is very dangerous. Moreover, the amount of debt borne by national railways will reach more than 100 million due to the gold price relationship. Taking the Beijing-Shanghai Railway as an example, the principal and interest payments on various debts, as well as the purchase of materials and the expenses of the entire railway, are about 23 million this year. The total revenue of the railway for the whole year is only 13 million, and the shortfall is about 10 million. The economic difficulties of other railways can be imagined even more. Under this situation where railway transportation is on the verge of bankruptcy, the method of reorganization is first to restore transportation capacity, and secondly to improve all equipment, as well as increase revenue and reduce expenditure in finance. The Ministry is responsible for reorganization and maintenance, and it is hoped that all representatives and experts will conduct thorough research on all reorganization plans, determine good policies, and establish a new foundation for railway transportation, so that the national economy can gradually develop and hope for prosperity.</p>
<p>▲ Experts gave speeches without formal presentations. Chen Guangfu gave a speech on the importance of the relationship between production and transportation and international trade and the national economy. Wang Jianzhong, the representative of the Hebei Chamber of Commerce Federation, spoke on the reorganization of railway transportation, with the prohibition of military troops commandeering trains and facilitating the transportation of commercial goods as the primary issues. Subsequently, Hong Shaofu, the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Transportation Industry Association, gave a congratulatory speech.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways</h3>
<p>Proposals for the Commercial Transport Conference</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways believes that during the military period, national railways accumulated many malpractices. Many troops stationed along the railways often commandeered vehicles, freely choosing routes, or colluded with railway staff to engage in corruption and arbitrarily extort money, resulting in hardship for both railways and merchants. During the military period, the Ministry of Railways had the intention to clear up accumulated malpractices, but in reality, there were many difficulties. Now that the military affairs have ended and the fire has been extinguished, these accumulated malpractices should be eliminated urgently to alleviate the people's suffering and maintain the railway transportation. It was decided to convene a commercial transport conference on March 1st to discuss methods of rectifying railway transportation and eliminating accumulated malpractices, and it will be implemented earnestly after the conference closes. The following are the proposals of the Ministry of Railways to the Commercial Transport Conference:</p>
<p>(1) Proposal to earnestly rectify railway affairs and commercial transportation. An investigation reveals that China's railways have a history of more than 60 years. Initially, due to the ignorance of the people, the construction of railways was interrupted. Furthermore, due to the corruption of the Qing government, the right to build railways was largely controlled by foreigners. Since the Xinhai Revolution, due to frequent internal wars and the autocracy of warlords, the completed railways have been on the verge of bankruptcy. After the establishment of the National Government, a special ministry was established to ensure that there was a dedicated department responsible, and its greatest purpose was to strive to rectify the completed railways during the period of political tutelage and to build the planned new railway lines so as to complete the Premier's grand vision of 100,000 miles of railways as soon as possible and to meet the needs of the people. Therefore, after the establishment of the Ministry, it devoted its efforts to rectifying the railways. However, at the beginning, there was the separation of Ning and Han, followed by the revolt of Feng, and then the rebellion of Zhu, so all kinds of plans were not achieved. Now that the period of political tutelage has begun, to carry out the original intention, it is necessary to earnestly rectify the railway affairs and commercial transportation of various railways. However, China's railways, due to the influence of the bad environment, have resulted in increasingly deep-seated malpractices. The transportation facilities are not very complete, and corruption by railway staff is inevitable. However, the Ministry can investigate and severely punish corruption by railway staff, but it is difficult to thoroughly investigate and eradicate the collusion between inferior merchants and railway staff. Therefore, after the locomotives and vehicles of various railways have been cleared or supplemented, and the Ministry has formulated service regulations for railway staff, the first thing to do is to eliminate the control of inferior merchants and the corruption of railway staff. It is proposed to first ban the freight forwarding companies that contract freight transportation on various railways so as to eliminate the malpractice of controlling vehicles and the collusion between inferior merchants and railway staff. Is this appropriate? It is submitted to the General Assembly for public decision.</p>
<p>(2) Cargo Transportation Responsibility Proposal: An investigation reveals that the responsibility for cargo transportation on national railways varies greatly. Some railways, such as the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways, assume absolutely no responsibility. Some railways, such as the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways, nominally do not assume responsibility but actually do. Some railways, such as the Beining and Sitao Railways, assume absolute responsibility. An examination of the cargo insurance business reveals that there are merchants in Shanghai who have organized companies to undertake insurance, and the fees charged, even for flammable items such as cotton, are only 2/1000. Compared to the Beining and other railways, which charge an additional 10% (ie, 10/100) on ordinary freight rates, the difference is 98%. The merchants consider the insurance fees set by the railway bureau to be too burdensome, so they are mostly hesitant to proceed. This regulation on charging fees for responsibility is equivalent to a formality. Now that all national railways have been unified, and the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways have proposed to amend the regulations of the transportation regulations that the cargo owner is responsible for, it is an essential plan for the railway to be responsible for the transportation of commercial goods. If the fees stipulated in the cargo transportation responsibility regulations of the Beining and Sitao Railways, which charge 10% of the ordinary freight rate, seem to be too high, it is proposed to follow the method of charging 2/1000 by the companies organized by Shanghai merchants.</p>
<p>The Ministry will entrust merchants to organize a railway cargo insurance company to be responsible for insurance, charging a fee of 2/1000, and the railway bureau will charge an additional 1% for the required tarpaulins and ropes. All national railways will follow this method. This method serves three purposes: the merchant pays this small fee, and the goods can be safely transported; the railway bureau can maintain the roadbed and avoid the loss of compensation; and the company can have a large amount of business to do and can develop commerce. It is beneficial to both the railway and the merchant. It is proposed to submit this method to the Commercial Transport Conference or the Transportation Conference for deliberation and implementation.</p>
<p>(3) Proposal to establish a water-land intermodal transport to facilitate merchants and travelers. An investigation reveals that intermodal transport has been established for more than ten years, and merchants and travelers find it convenient. China has a vast land and abundant resources, and a dense population. Passenger and freight transportation are both very important, and it is not enough to meet the needs without handling water-land intermodal transport. For example, Sino-Japanese intermodal transport and Asian-American intermodal transport both have shipping companies participating to facilitate contact, and the need for domestic water-land intermodal transport is even more pressing. Although it has been proposed repeatedly, it has not yet been implemented, which is a pity. It is proposed that the General Assembly decide that railway and shipping companies jointly handle water-land intermodal transport, and the detailed methods will be decided by the Intermodal Transport Conference and submitted to the Ministry for approval and implementation. Is this appropriate? It is requested to be publicly decided. (4) Request to modify the ordinary cargo table and add omitted items. An investigation reveals that the ordinary cargo classification table, with items classified by category and grade, can be said to be complete. However, due to the development of industry and commerce, new items are produced daily, and omissions are inevitable. Moreover, due to the impact of the war in China in recent years and the competition from foreign goods, the Ministry has often reduced the originally determined grades for the sake of promoting industry, and various railways have often submitted requests for instructions and explanations to determine the grades and charge fees accordingly. In order to facilitate the review of the item grade regulations for the staff of cargo stations and merchants on various railways and to formulate a complete item grade table, it is proposed to modify the ordinary cargo classification table and add omitted items. Is this appropriate? It is respectfully requested to be submitted to the General Assembly for public decision. (5) Request to review the special or dedicated freight rates of various railways to avoid divergence. An investigation reveals that each national railway has its own special or dedicated freight rates. The purpose is nothing more than to revitalize industry, maintain food supplies, use the fullness of empty vehicles, or negotiate this method due to military relations. This method was originally intended as a temporary remedy, but over the years, the special or dedicated rates of various railways have become numerous and divergent, which is contrary to transportation principles. Now that the national affairs are settled and the national railways are gradually returning to their original state, many of these special or dedicated rates are not suitable, and they are also inconsistent with the principles of cargo classification tables and cargo vehicle transportation. There are also special rates that are set for only one or two companies, and other companies in the same industry cannot enjoy them. These non-public special rates are biased, so merchants often submit requests to the Ministry to reduce freight rates by analogy. In order to rectify cargo trade fees and eliminate divergence, it is proposed to review the special or dedicated freight rates of various railways to rectify them. Is this appropriate? It is respectfully requested to be submitted to the General Assembly for public decision.</p>

<h3>Outline of the Agreement on the Haiyuan Pavilion Books Proposed by the Shandong Library</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Library, upon instruction from the Department of Education, which was relayed from the Ministry of Education, is negotiating with the Yang family of Liaocheng regarding the collection of books at the Haiyuan Pavilion and has drafted an outline of the agreement on the Haiyuan Pavilion books. After receiving the draft, the matriarch of the Yang family went to Tianjin to consult with her heir, Yang Jingfu, and Jingfu's maternal uncle, Chang, regarding the matter. This is because the rare Song and Yuan editions of the Haiyuan Pavilion are currently stored in the Chang family's residence. The matriarch of the Yang family has now returned to Jinan, and it is yet to be decided which of the three options will be adopted. The Haiyuan Pavilion collection of books was amassed by Yang Zhitang. Yang was born during the Daoguang era of the previous dynasty. The books were not originally owned by the family but were acquired entirely from the Wang family's Yiyun Study collection when they were transported to Shandong. Other parts were obtained from the Leshan Hall. The Yang family has collected books for four generations, specializing in versions and bibliography, and their preservation and management methods are extremely comprehensive. Unfortunately, some of the collection was damaged during the Nian Rebellion in the late Qing Dynasty. Further damage occurred when bandits occupied Liaocheng the year before last, and again last year when bandits reoccupied Liaocheng. Currently, more than sixty boxes are still sealed off and have not yet been sorted. Now, the draft outline of the agreement on the Haiyuan Pavilion books prepared by the Provincial Library is recorded below: (A) Method of entrusting the library to preserve the books on behalf of the Yang family: (1) The ownership of all the Yang family's books shall first be clearly determined by the provincial government through an official order, stating that they are entirely the private property of the Yang family. A public announcement shall be made and reported to the National Government for record. The precedent of the Rongbentang Library shall be followed, and commendations shall be made through official orders. (2) A "Yang Family Haiyuan Pavilion Books Management Committee" shall be established. The government shall nominate ten members, and the community shall nominate ten members of excellent character and scholarship to jointly form the committee. All plans regarding the preservation and management shall be decided entirely by the committee and submitted to the library for execution. The chairmanship of the committee shall be held by Mr. Yang Jingfu, the owner of the Haiyuan Pavilion. (3) The library shall specially build a large-scale building to preserve the books for the Yang family, with sturdiness, aesthetics, and functionality as the three major elements. The design of the building shall also be decided by the committee. The building shall retain the old name of Haiyuan Pavilion, and a stone tablet shall be erected in the middle of the main building, with the government's official order and the National Government's commendation order engraved on the tablet for permanent record. (4) The committee shall be permanently independent and shall not be subject to any constraints. The library shall be responsible for proposing and executing the resolutions of the committee. All progress shall be controlled by the committee, and effective guarantees shall be provided in terms of politics and law. If a member is unable to perform their duties, or if the Yang family believes that the books are not being properly preserved, they may take them back at any time, and this shall be specified in the official order. (5) The library shall bear all expenses for the construction of the Haiyuan Pavilion building, bookshelves, desks, and all arrangement and sorting costs, as well as all expenses of the committee, or request the provincial government to designate special funds for handling it, so that the merits of the Yang family's ancestors in collecting books can benefit the people. (7) Those who come to the Haiyuan Pavilion to read books may be charged a fee, the amount of which shall be determined by the committee. Tickets shall be printed, stamped, and numbered and sent to the library for sale. The accounts shall be settled clearly each month, and the receipts shall be returned to the committee for review. Upon verification, the ticket price shall be transferred to the Yang family as private income. The committee and the library shall not use it. (8) With the consent of the committee, the library may find ways to print and publish the rare books of the Haiyuan Pavilion. The proceeds from the book sales, after deducting costs, shall be owned by the Yang family. All income and expenditure accounts may be checked by the committee at any time and reported to the Yang family. (9) To honor the Yang family's book collection, the library may compile two types of books: 1. A history of the Yang Family Haiyuan Pavilion collection; 2. A catalog of the Yang Family Haiyuan Pavilion collection. The compilation methods shall be determined separately. (10) The Yang family has the right to supervise and assess the above items at any time. If there is any non-compliance, they may raise questions and take other appropriate measures. Separate assessment methods shall be jointly followed. (11) The books entrusted by the Yang family to the library for preservation must include all or a large part of the rare editions. If they are ordinary Ming and Qing editions, it is feared that there will be no value in collecting reading fees, and readers will not be willing to pay. It will also be difficult to handle photocopying and publishing. (12) The above books must be in a quantity that warrants the construction of a special building. The library hopes to preserve all or two-thirds of the Yang family's books. If there are only dozens or hundreds of types, only three or five bookshelves are needed, which is not enough for the construction of a special building. It would be a waste of public funds and a useless idleness, which seems difficult to implement. (13) In addition to the above, the Yang family may add and negotiate other matters related to the rights and interests of the Yang family. (B) Method of half donation and half sale: (1) The library shall, together with the Yang family, invite several people of excellent character and scholarship from both the government and the community to assess the value of the entire collection. Within this valuation, the Yang family can reduce the price by a certain amount, and the reduced amount shall be regarded as the Yang family's contribution to Shandong culture. At that time, the government may grant appropriate commendations depending on the situation. (2) The library shall build a building to house the books, still using the name of the Haiyuan Pavilion. (3) The library may allocate a certain amount each year from the Haiyuan Pavilion book fees and the profits from the rare books published by the Yang family to give to the Yang family. The amount shall be determined separately. (4) The library shall still print and compile a history and catalog of the Haiyuan Pavilion's collection to praise the Yang family's virtue of collecting books. (5) The value and quantity of the books shall be based on items 11 and 12 of method A. If they are ordinary editions or of little value, the methods shall be discussed separately. (C) Method of purchasing at a fair price: (1) The Yang family shall first provide the number and version of the books to the library. The library shall send personnel to the location of the book collection to view and appraise them, or the library may open the list if the Yang family does not provide one. (2) The library's purchase of books shall be limited to rare editions and books not already in the library's collection. If they are ordinary editions and are already in the library's collection, the library may handle them according to the situation. (3) After the library has selected the books, the Yang family or a representative shall negotiate the price with the library, and with the consent of both parties, invite several people of excellent character and scholarship from the government and the community to mediate the price. (4) Once the price has been agreed upon, the procedures for delivering the books and paying the money shall be completed. (5) If the library cannot purchase all the books at once, the library shall have priority over other public cultural institutions to purchase them if the Yang family wishes to continue selling them in the future. The Yang family is free to choose, add, or subtract from the above three items. Even if they completely disagree and propose other methods, the library is willing to consider accepting them. Even if they are completely rejected, indicating that there is no room for negotiation, the library will not force them, because this collection of books is entirely the private property of the Yang family, and the library has no right to interfere, so it cannot force anyone to fulfill any obligations.</p>

<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>The Manager of Changyuan Bank Embezzles Funds and Flees: The Changyuan Bank of Zhu Jiajiao Town was opened in the autumn of the 18th year of the Republic and has been doing well. The manager of the bank, Shen Xun Chu, is from Baigong Town, Shaoxing. He used to work at Yuzhuang in the town. He is addicted to vices and squanders money, and has been losing a lot of money in recent years. Unable to make up for it, he suddenly embezzled more than 9,000 yuan of deposits in the middle of the night a few days ago and fled without a trace, abandoning his family. The bank manager has now been promoted by Dong Longsheng, who used to be a street vendor.</p>
<p>Two Bandits Executed by Firing Squad: The County Government signed and delivered the main criminals Fan Aliulu and Lu Jingtutu of the kidnapping and robbery cases in Shengjiawan, Qitangtou, and Nanxihe on the morning of the 26th of last month at 7:00 AM. After verifying their identities, they were taken to the execution ground and executed by firing squad.</p>
<p>Verdict on Inheritance Case: After Xu Yuqing of Panjiawan, Qingpu District 13, died, he left behind about 150 mu of farmland and many houses. His heir, Xu Jiafei, hired lawyer Zhou Xiao'an to accuse Xu Yuqing's adopted son, Xu Shirong, of disrupting the clan and seizing the inheritance. Xu Shirong also hired lawyer Yu Zuwang to write a defense. The case has now been decided by the County Government. (Main text) Xu Shirong cannot exclusively occupy the farmland and houses left by Xu Yuqing and should hand them over as soon as possible. The clan leader shall convene a family meeting to allocate 60% to Xu Jiafei for management and 40% to Xu Shirong. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant. However, Xu Shirong secretly sold more than 13 mu of farmland during the litigation restraint and will be prosecuted in another case.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Doubt Regarding the Election Qualifications for the National Assembly: Article 5, paragraph 1, item 3 of the National Assembly Representatives Election Law, regarding industrial groups, is defined in Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Implementation Law as those who engage in various businesses with capital or skills. However, the original text does not have any examples. Does this refer to fishing associations, mining associations, or shipping associations? County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia of this county, due to the matter involving election qualifications and not being able to decide on his own, telegraphed the Commissioner of Civil Affairs and Chief Election Supervisor Hu Pu'an, requesting instructions on how to proceed. In addition, County Magistrate and Election Supervisor Pan Zhongjia previously received a telegram from Chief Hu ordering the issuance of a table of dates for the election to be handled by each county. The first item limited each local election supervisor to periodically notify local groups to prepare detailed registers and submit them for review, with an estimated time of seven days, from February 27 to March 5. All groups must prepare and submit them without delay. After receiving the telegram, Supervisor Pan, in addition to notifying them, also announced to all groups to follow the regulations and quickly implement items of Article 7 of the Implementation Law and the telegram from Chief Supervisor, limiting the dates for preparing the registers in order to forward them on time. Mr. Pan, fearing that the groups would not be able to complete the process within the deadline and hinder the election, convened a meeting of representatives of various groups at the county government yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. After the attendees expressed their views, it was decided to actively proceed separately and complete the process within the deadline to avoid delaying the election.</p>
<p>Catering Businesses Stop Collecting Banquet Donations: After the banquet donation in this county was reduced from January 1, the amount collected has been extremely short, making it difficult to continue. The issue of collecting banquet donations for weddings, funerals, and celebrations with self-prepared dishes has not yet been resolved, so there is no hope for the department. The catering businesses in the urban area collect banquet donations on behalf of the department, but the catering businesses have been greatly affected before the issue of self-prepared dish donations is resolved. Therefore, the catering businesses have decided to temporarily suspend the collection from March 1 to maintain their business.</p>
<p>Limited Speed Construction Begins on Xichang Provincial Road: Construction on the Xiyi section of the provincial road began last winter, but construction on the Xichang section has not yet started. Yesterday, the Construction Bureau of the County Government received instructions from the Construction Department stating that the Yichang Provincial Road is a major transportation line in southern Jiangsu Province, and all counties along the line are building roads, but the Xichang section of the county has not yet started construction. The busy farming season is coming soon, so you should quickly prepare for soliciting workers and building roads so that the entire road can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Bandit Leader Gao Xiaosheng Captured in Wucheng: Gao Xiaosheng, a notorious bandit from Jiangyin, is from Jiajiatou, Huangtu North, Licheng Township, Jiangyin County, and is 28 years old. Since the bandits Mao Xuedong and others were executed, the bandits elected him as their leader, repeatedly kidnapping and robbing in the area bordering Wucheng County, committing numerous crimes. The governments of both counties have offered a reward of 500 yuan each and issued a notice to cooperate in the arrest. Recently, Gao Xiaosheng, because of the intense pursuit, dared not hide in his hometown and planned to hire a boat to go to Zhangzhu Mountain to hide. It was agreed that the boat fare would be 16 yuan. On the 27th, at dusk, he and his wife moved their soft goods and clothes onto the boat and were about to set sail when the Weicheng Township Security Regiment of the First District of Wucheng learned of this and immediately reported it to the Provincial Guard stationed at Yantouqiao. They also joined the Sanguandian Township Security Regiment of Jiangyin County and pursued them on the riverbank. The team saw that the boat was sailing very fast, so they opened fire on the shore. In desperation, Gao ordered the boatman to row quickly, intending to flee to Xiaohuitou Village. Unexpectedly, before the boat approached the shore, Gao stumbled out of the cabin and jumped ashore to escape. Due to panic, he fell into the river. At this time, the security regiments ambushed at Sanyuanqiao in the east, Taipingqiao in the north, and Qianzhouqiao Yongliqiao in the west all came out and captured the bandit Gao Xiaosheng. They interrogated him strictly about where the guns were hidden. He confessed that four guns were hidden in the home of a certain family in Huangtu Houchun. They were immediately escorted to search, but they were not found. Because the bandit was extremely fierce, one of his ears was cut off at the time. His wife took the opportunity to escape. Gao was escorted to the defense post of the Provincial Guard at Yantouqiao, Wucheng. County Magistrate Zhang reported that a team would be sent to the city today (the 1st) to pick him up for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Late-Night Intrusion into Girls' School Settled with Seven Dollars Fine A person named Yuan Qixiang, on the 23rd of this month at 10 PM, scaled the wall from the mountain behind the Shimei County Girls' Middle School. He was apprehended by school staff and handed over to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Later, Yuan Yihuai of the Xinsheng Daily proved the person's reliability and bailed him out. It is now heard that the Director of Education Bureau, Gao Zishan, due to this person's late-night scaling of the wall and intrusion into the girls' school, specially sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau requesting strict investigation. Director Yin, after receiving the letter, immediately ordered Inspector Luo of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau to have the guarantor hand him over. Yuan Yihuai then sent Yuan Qixiang to the General Bureau. On the 27th, Section Chief Lu Zhibin of the Third Section opened a court hearing. Yuan still claimed it was due to being drunk and lost. As a result, it was announced that Yuan's late-night private entry into the girls' school was indeed inappropriate behavior, and he should be sentenced to seven days of detention, and a letter of repentance should be kept on file. Later, someone pleaded with Section Chief Lu, considering it was a drunken offense, and asked if a fine could be substituted. This was approved, and a fine of seven silver dollars was paid to settle the matter.</p>
<p>Citizens of Shazhou City File a Large Petition The lower reaches of the Fourth Main Canal, flowing from Shazhou into the Yangtze River, are excessively silted. The County Administrative Council has resolved to raise funds for dredging. However, the discharge of the Fourth Main Canal must pass through Nantong, and the Yicheng River sandbar, for which the Nantong Education Bureau has applied for reclamation, is currently undergoing enclosure construction. The area fears that Nantong will not leave an outlet for the waterway. The district head, Shen Changjun, has telegraphed the county government to forward a request to the Civil Affairs Department, ordering Tong County to allow passage. On the public's side, representatives such as Cao Wenhu and 56 others came to the city, each carrying a small white flag, to petition the county. Secretary Jin met with them and the representatives raised several points: (1) Requesting the government to revoke the resolution of the February 20th Provisional County Council meeting to allocate 23,000 yuan of North-South irrigation funds to dredge the Sanzhangpu Canal; (2) Requesting immediate orders to the Construction Bureau to conduct surveying immediately and complete the work within a limited time; (3) Requesting the County Magistrate to accompany the people to inspect the actual conditions of the Fourth Main Canal; (4) Requesting the government to be responsible for planning the dredging of the lower reaches of the Fourth Main Canal; (5) At a minimum, it should be completed simultaneously with the upper reaches; (6) Requesting a prompt investigation into the 20,000 yuan in irrigation funds paid by the Welfare Company in previous years, designated for dredging the Sanzhangpu Canal. They requested satisfactory answers to all the above points, otherwise, they would not return home. They then received a reply stating: "The petition is understood. The case of dredging the lower reaches of the Fourth Main Canal has been submitted to the 41st County Council meeting for resolution. The shortage of 30,000 yuan should be addressed by the Finance Bureau, according to the County Administrative Council resolution, by collecting as much North-South channel irrigation fees as possible for dredging purposes. The presented situation is noted for your information." All representatives then withdrew. However, the representatives were still dissatisfied with this reply. On the afternoon of the 27th, they went to the county government again to continue petitioning.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Supervisory Office Still Difficult to Close Down The Jiangsu Pacification Supervisory Office has been established for more than three months. According to regulations, the pacification period ends on March 14th. At present, all major bandit communists along the Huaihai and Canal areas have been cleared as scheduled. Therefore, Supervisor Zhang has ordered the various sections to close down separately, so that they can submit requests for revocation on schedule. However, the Commander-in-Chief believes that although the bandit communists in Jiangsu have been cleared, rural pacification is still very important and cannot be done without the assistance of the National Army. Therefore, the closure of the Pacification Supervisory Office is not yet the right time.</p>
<p>Liang Guanying to Marry in Yangzhou Liang Guanying, the Commander-in-Chief of the 25th Route Army, came to Yangzhou yesterday afternoon from Nanjing to consult with Supervisor Zhang on everything. This morning, he returned to Pu by special Yutai steamer with advisor Wang Xuesheng and others. It is also heard that Commander-in-Chief Liang, after many years of military service, is still unmarried. He is now engaged to a woman surnamed Song as his bride. According to reports, Miss Song is from Tianjin, and her father is a prominent official in Hebei during the Republic of China. The Song family has now arrived in Yangzhou and is staying at the Bao Yang Hotel. It is heard that Commander-in-Chief Liang will come to Yangzhou for an auspicious wedding date immediately after the Qingjiang Sports Meet closes.</p>
<p>Request to Withdraw Abduction Case Denied Yang Fu, of Huangjueqiao in this county, sued the court last year to hold Liang Tisheng accountable for abducting his daughter. The prosecutor concluded the investigation and immediately filed a public prosecution. However, Yang and others have recently reached an out-of-court settlement and have petitioned the court's criminal division to withdraw the case. The criminal division now believes that this case was initiated by the prosecutor and not by the plaintiff, and that the crime under Article 240 of the Criminal Law cannot be freely withdrawn. The request for withdrawal is legally inconsistent and should not be discussed. The court will still summon them for questioning within the next few days.</p>
<p>Fundamental Solution to Education Funding in Jiangdu The education sector in Jiangdu previously went on strike to demand wages. Later, on the evening of Gengwu New Year's Eve, they raised funds to make do and resumed classes. However, they are still in arrears for five months. It is now learned that the county government has comprehensively planned to order the grain depot chiefs to hand over 300 yuan per day for fifty days to prepare for paying the arrears. It also plans to establish a fundamental solution based on the regulations of the Education Department that assistant teachers should not be established for each grade if there are fewer than 50 students. The number of students in each grade of each school will be investigated, and assistant teachers in grades with insufficient numbers will be eliminated. At the same time, assistant teachers will be notified to submit supporting documents and review their qualifications. Those who do not meet the qualifications will be dismissed immediately. If there are more people than positions, the qualified assistant teachers who have not been selected will be registered separately and filled when vacancies arise. By reducing expenditure in this way, the budget can be met. The Education Bureau is currently drafting a report to submit to the department and county for approval.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Detailed Record of the Daoist Priestess Riot The Gaoyou County Party Committee, in order to thoroughly eliminate superstition, destroyed all the idols in the City God Temple at approximately 11 AM on the 23rd. This provoked a backlash from the Daoist priestesses. Yesterday (the 27th) at approximately 6 PM, about forty or fifty Daoist priestesses in the city, mostly elderly and unable to walk, hired forty or fifty rickshaws. They departed from the City God Temple, each carrying gongs and foreign boxes, wildly banging them along the streets, shouting, "The Bodhisattva is in trouble! Why don't you come out and protect them?" This stirred up the general public, who also followed along. By the time they reached the County Party Committee, the accompanying crowd had grown to seven or eight hundred people. When the Daoist priestesses arrived at the County Party Committee, they led the general public to storm in and destroy everything. They then went to the home of Party Committee member Huang Renyan. The Huang family was prepared, and the front and back doors were tightly closed. The Daoist priestesses then led the crowd to smash the doors. The nearby merchant corps heard the news and sent armed personnel to the scene to persuade them, but failed to stop them. The Daoist priestesses and the public broke open the front and back doors and swarmed in, dividing up and destroying all the utensils, clothing, and other items, resulting in an estimated loss of several thousand yuan. They then went to the home of Party Standing Committee member Huang Songtao and destroyed various items, resulting in considerable losses. This morning (the 28th), the Daoist priestesses again departed from the City God Temple in rickshaws, each carrying small flags with slogans, ordering all stores to close.</p>
<p>The market was in chaos throughout the city, and the authorities were unable to stop them. (February 28)</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Measures for Dealing with Zhang Jian's Rebellious Property The Jiangsu Provincial Government consulted the Ministry of Interior regarding the disposal of Zhang Jian's rebellious property, and the Executive Yuan approved the maintenance of the original confiscation plan. Zhang Dengqing was appointed and sent to Nantong to work with the county government to divide the property according to the provincial six-county four-division plan. County Magistrate Zhang received four measures: (1) All of Zhang Jian's property within Nantong territory, previously marked by the county but with no one responding, will now have its houses, fields, and stocks temporarily valued according to previous estimates, and divided according to the provincial six-county four-division precedent for provincial and local education and relief efforts; (2) The capital stock and cultivated fields of the Jianken Company within Dongtai territory will also be handled in accordance with Nantong; (3) All of Zhang Jian's seized movable property, except for stocks, has been taken away, so there is no need to reserve a portion for the necessary living expenses of his family; (4) The Civil Affairs Department will appoint a special commissioner to go to Nantong and Dongtai to handle the matter together with the county government.</p>
<p>Shocking News of Robbery by the Merchant Corps A person surnamed Chen of Henghekou in the east of the city was suddenly attacked by four thugs carrying guns on the night of the 26th. They were captured by residents gathering together. Unexpectedly, they were members of the merchant corps stationed in the east of the city and have been handed over to the corps headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Eight Bottles of Soy Sauce Lead to Mutual Assault between Officers and Crew The Xinning Hailun arrived at the port at 4 PM yesterday. Salt police officers from the Ningbo Salt Police Bureau immediately boarded the ship to search for smuggled salt. They found eight small bottles of soy sauce in the cabin and wanted to take them to the bureau for confiscation. The ship's steward argued with the police officers, who refused and insisted on taking them to the bureau, leading to a conflict. The police officers telegraphed the bureau, and Inspector Yao Xingtang led twelve armed police officers to the ship for a major search. As a result, the steward and the police officers assaulted each other, resulting in multiple injuries on both sides. The police officers arrested five people, including steward Chun Gui, Aru, cook Ayu, fireman Amao, and worker Shangde, tied them with ropes, and took them to the bureau, intending to send them to court.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Dredging of Qianbu Jing Jointly by Songjiang and Fengxian Counties The Qianbu Jing, the watershed of Fengxian and Songjiang counties, is currently being surveyed by personnel dispatched by the Construction Bureau in conjunction with the local water conservancy bureau to measure the amount of earthwork. The total length of the river is more than 4,870 zhang. All expenses have been fully collected during this year's winter grain transport. Yesterday, Zhou Jianju also led the team to transfer the funds and set a deadline of the 5th of this month to cut off the water and build the embankments, and the 10th to start construction. On the Songjiang side, the Yexie District Office will also jointly dredge from the Yexie Port, the exit of the Jing, simultaneously. The budget is expected to be completed before the Qingming Festival.</p>
<p>Letter Received</p>
<h3>Letter from Wang Huankun, Former Director of the Yangzhong County Education Bureau</h3>
<p>The sections published in your newspaper's Yangzhong correspondence on the 28th of last month do not conform to the facts. Please correct them. 1. The nature of the Education Bureau is not a contracting agency. The bureau's expenses and budget are slightly more than others, but there is no doubling. 2. Travel expenses are reimbursed based on actual expenses, and at most are only about 20 yuan. 3. The department order to abolish the head of the social education section due to financial constraints is even more unfounded. There is no monthly expenditure of 24 yuan for public expenses. 4. The funds of February 8th were borrowed from the county government in January by the accountant and acting section chief to pay the December salaries of the schools. The 8th was merely to complete the accounting procedures due to the change of county magistrate. Therefore, when I left office, the salaries for January and February and the borrowed funds that should be received by the retiring personnel were not settled. In addition to transferring them to the successor for priority repayment, each borrowed money to start the journey. Wang Huankun, former director of the Yangzhong County Education Bureau, 20, 3, 1.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Fenghua County Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>I read in your newspaper's news column on the 25th of this month about the robbery of a nunnery by bandits in Fenghua, which is shocking to hear. Upon investigation, there is a Jiling Nunnery near the East Gate of this city, commonly known as Shuimendong Nunnery, which is only a few thatched huts in a very remote location. There is only one old nun and one old woman in the nunnery. After 2 AM on the night of the 21st of this month, thieves entered through a hole dug in the kitchen. The old nun, Changliang, woke up in a dream and got up to look. The thieves took out iron chisels to intimidate her, causing slight injury to the nun's face. After checking, only twelve silver dollars and a pair of woolen sleeves were lost. There were only two thieves, and there were no guns or other items. The report in your newspaper that six or seven bandits suddenly came at 9 PM on the 21st, each carrying a quick-firing gun, is completely inconsistent with the facts. Please make corrections quickly to show the truth. Fenghua County Government Public Security Bureau, February 27.</p>

<h3>Three Ministers Hosted a Banquet the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital</p>
<p>Fundraising Team Leader</p>
<p>▲Distinguished figures all gave earnest speeches</p>
<p>On the evening of February 28, the three ministers, Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, and Liu Ruiheng, invited the leaders of the Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital fundraising team to the Bankers' Association. Those present included Tang Shaochuan, Zhang Qun, Qian Xinzhi, Zhu Jiahua, Chu Minyi, Huang Hanliang, Zhao Jinqing, Liu Hongsheng, Rong Zongjing, Wang Xiaolai, Lao Jingxiu, Guo Biao, Qin Runqing, Li Zhaohuan, Yang Dunfu, Wang Boyuan, Lin Kanghou, Yang Zhaoxun, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Lu Bohong, Shou Yicheng, Shi Liangcai, and Lu Yuequan, more than thirty people, a grand occasion for a time. After taking their seats, Liu Ruiheng, as chairman, reported, followed by speeches from various celebrities. (1) Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun said that Shanghai's population is increasing every year. A survey last year showed about 2.8 million people. Now there are 1 million people in the Public Concession, 500,000 in the French Concession, and a total of more than 3.1 million including the Chinese area. On average, there are 182 people per mu, making it the most densely populated place in the world and the third largest city in the world. Various constructions in Shanghai are considered developed, but there is still a lack of hospitals run by Chinese people themselves. Ordinary residents have no way to get treatment, especially the lower and middle classes. Now, everyone is enthusiastic about public welfare and initiated the establishment of Zhongshan Hospital. The city government is both extremely grateful and ashamed. There are two points to discuss: (A) It is hoped that the establishment of this hospital will consider the current and future citizens at the same time and strive for convenience. The location of the hospital should be close to the new city center. (B) The fees charged by current hospitals are too expensive. Attention should be paid to the common people. This hospital commemorates Mr. Zhongshan and should promote the Three Principles of the People to all the people. As for how the hospital should be built and equipped, there are plans by various experts, and I dare not participate in the final discussion. I will follow everyone and do my best to support it. (2) Zhu Jiahua, president of the National Central University, said that the Medical College of the National Central University is one of the highest medical schools in the country, but it is very ashamed that it does not have its own hospital for practice. Now, everyone has initiated Zhongshan Hospital, which will provide a place for the common people to be treated and provide students of the Medical College of the National Central University with sufficient practice opportunities. The prosperity and decline of the National Central University is by no means trivial. I am extremely grateful for the efforts of the gentlemen in promoting it. The two points mentioned by Mayor Zhang are very pertinent. The area under the jurisdiction of the current city government is not very developed commercially and has little income, so it cannot establish a large-scale hospital. The establishment of this hospital should be close to the new urban area and can also help the development of the new urban area. It is hoped that Mayor Zhang will have a bigger plan and a more macro organization in the future, so that the students of the Medical College of the National Central University can have more convenient practice, which is what I sincerely hope for. (3) Tang Shaochuan said that the medical business should have sufficient economic power before this can be discussed. Even if the hospital charges a few cents to a few yuan, it still needs to subsidize a lot. Now the price of gold is soaring, and various medicinal materials and equipment are four or five times more expensive than before, and the amount of loss is even more considerable. Therefore, the Zhongshan Hospital should pay attention to the fund in this fundraising. I think that the amount of one million is still not enough. It should be raised to one million and fifty thousand, so that there will be a slightly foundation. Because the number of one million and fifty thousand seems very large, but if it is divided among 48 teams, each team will only have 30,000 yuan, which is not difficult to raise. I am one of the team members and will do my best. I hope that everyone can do their best to solicit donations. (4) Yan Fuqing said that the need for hospitals in Shanghai has been discussed in detail by leaders from all walks of life. The purpose of initiating this hospital is to relieve the suffering of the lower and middle classes of society and to take the lead in the country. In the future, all provinces, cities, and counties will have the prevalence of hospitals. Now the preparatory committee has repeatedly held meetings to discuss that Shanghai will first be divided into four teams to raise funds separately, and it is also planned to organize by industry and solicit donations from foreign countries at the same time. The current organization is quite imperfect. Please give guidance from everyone, and please contact the team leaders and team members. It is really a unprecedented grand event for everyone to spare time to come. It can be predicted that the fundraising will be successful in the future. As for the point raised by Mr. Tang Shaochuan about the amount of fundraising, it is necessary to increase it. Because the establishment of hospitals in Europe and the United States is now a standard, each bed is calculated at 4,000 US dollars. The Zhongshan Hospital plans to set up 300 beds, which should have 1.2 million US dollars, which is equivalent to 6 million silver dollars. With extremely simple equipment, it should get half the number, and the fund is not included. I sincerely hope that this fundraising can exceed several times to announce success. (5) Chairman Liu Ruiheng said that a friend talked to me during a week, saying that Chinese people can't run hospitals and are unwilling to spend money to run hospitals. I was very stimulated when I heard this. This friend did not observe the situation in China thoroughly, so he had this argument. But I hope that everyone will work hard to support it, so that Zhongshan Hospital can easily reach completion, on the one hand, to show our country's construction ability, and on the other hand, to break the long-standing concept of foreigners. (6) Yan Fuqing was elected as the chief fundraiser, and the donation forms were distributed to the team leaders, and everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Gold Bars Exported</h3>
<p>▲Worth 22.2 Million Silver Dollars</p>
<p>The Mainland News reported that when the President Grant sailed last Friday, 20,000 gold bars were loaded on board from Shanghai and transported to the United States. According to the current price of gold, the total value is 22.2 million silver dollars. These gold bars have been stored in a certain bank in Shanghai for some time. This time they are being transported to the United States for deposit so that they can be withdrawn at any time. The ownership has not been transferred, so it does not conflict with the government's ban on gold exports. According to the opinion of a well-known foreign exchange manager, this will not affect the Shanghai exchange market because the ownership has not been transferred.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Transportation and Foreign Electric Companies</h3>
<p>Agreed on Submarine Cable Contract</p>
<p>▲Can Still Send Submarine Cable</p>
<p>▲Quoted Price Slightly Increased</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the Shanghai-Hong Kong cable of the Great Northern Telegraph Company lands at Gulangyu, and the Shanghai-Hong Kong cable of the Eastern Telegraph Company lands on the coast near Fuzhou. The lines from Gulangyu to Xiamen and from the coast to Fuzhou have always been leased from the Chinese Telegraph Bureau. In January of this year, the contract expired and was taken back by the Chinese Telegraph Bureau. Therefore, telegrams to Fuzhou and Xiamen must be sent via the Chinese Telegraph Bureau's landline. Recently, the Ministry of Transportation and the three companies have agreed on the submarine cable contract, so telegrams to the two ports can be sent by submarine cable again, and then transferred by the Chinese Telegraph Bureau. Therefore, the quoted price has slightly increased, with each Chinese plain text character at 1.5 cents, and each foreign language and Chinese code character at 3 cents.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Order</h3>
<p>Two Railways to Economize</p>
<p>▲Limit the Number of Employees and Replacements</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration received an order from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating that after the end of military affairs, various state-owned railways are in need of restoration, and equipment maintenance requires funds everywhere. The Director of the Railway Administration should work harder at this time, comprehensively assessing the reality, and ensuring that funds are not wasted and that personnel are not redundant, so that each person can be used to their full potential. The total number of employees on the railway should be limited to the current number. If there are departures or vacancies, only replacements from the existing personnel are allowed, and no one should be added under any pretext. As for year-end salary increases, they should be strictly assessed. Those who have not made special achievements in their work should not be requested for salary increases. Even those whose achievements are particularly outstanding and have facts to prove it must be reported in detail for verification, so as to save railway funds and use them for various construction projects. Please strictly follow this and do not treat it as a mere formality. This is very important.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Chambers of Commerce</h3>
<p>Telegraphed Request to Abolish Railway Surcharges</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China telegraphed the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating that the National Government has clearly ordered the abolition of the nationwide Likin tax, and merchants and people are all rejoicing and encouraged. All other surcharges that are similar to Likin in name but the same in substance should also be abolished, so as to live up to the ultimate intention of relieving the people's burden. However, the railway transportation surcharge still exists, which is a stain on the major policies. This surcharge is collected by adding 2 cents to train tickets and 7% to freight transport. Tax is collected on goods, which is no different from Likin. Its origin is actually Sun Chuanfang's transportation tax. The warlords have long been eliminated, and their bad policies should not be allowed to exist in disguise. Moreover, this burden is the deepest for merchants, because the smooth flow of goods relies solely on convenient transportation. If all other burdens are removed, but a disguised surcharge is still added to transportation, it is not fair in terms of policy and hinders commercial progress, and it is both deep and significant. The government's way to reorganize transportation, increase revenue, and reduce expenditure is very broad. At this time of renewal, when the people's burdens are being removed, it seems unnecessary to follow the example of the lower levels and allow this abnormal Likin tax to continue to exist. It should be transferred to the Ministry for review and approval to immediately abolish the railway reorganization transportation surcharge, which is extremely urgent.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Investigates Wusong Conservancy Surcharge</h3>
<p>The Wusong Conservancy Bureau previously, based on the opinion of the Harmonious Merchants Association, forwarded to the Shanghai foreign merchants shipping industry, all agreed that the latest built ships in the world have doubled in tonnage, and can not run smoothly if the draft is not dug to more than 30 feet. If the shoal outside the mouth of Wusong is not opened, shipping companies will lose both time and economy by detouring. It was requested to suggest to the Bureau that the Wusong Conservancy Bureau convene Chinese and foreign shipping industries, repeatedly decided to dig, all expenses, decided by foreign merchants to add a surcharge on imported goods, has been announced by the Jianghai Customs Tax Office, starting from April 1, according to the new tax rate, draw 3% of the Wusong Conservancy tax, (because the Wusong Conservancy tax has been drawn in accordance with the the tax rules to collect three Li, now merged to collect,) on one hand, the Wusong Conservancy Bureau will conference results and dredging Shen Tan plan, filed with the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Finance, after going, has not been approved. It is now heard that the Ministry of Transportation found that the Wusong Conservancy Bureau is currently planning to dredge Shen Tan, and it has been discussed that from April 1 of this year, the Jianghai Customs will increase the Wusong Conservancy surcharge on imported goods to fill the funding. It is said that the Ministry of Finance has been consulted to transfer it to the Jianghai Customs for review.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Decides</h3>
<p>Specific Opinions on Business Tax</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of implementing business tax in this city, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously decided at the 11th Executive Committee meeting to form a special committee to study the various points presented by each industry in detail and formulate specific opinions as the basis for the association's representatives to attend discussions with the Finance Bureau. It is heard that the special committee has held two meetings and has had detailed discussions on (1) the principles of implementing business tax in this city, (2) the review of the draft collection regulations, (3) the review of the draft collection rules, and (4) opinions on tax rate classification. The discussion results have been made into a report and sent by Committee Chairman Wang Yansong to the association's Standing Committee. At the 33rd Standing Committee meeting the day before yesterday, it was submitted for review and passed item by item. It was resolved to be used as the association's specific opinions on the municipal business tax and should be sent to the five committee members attending the Finance Bureau: Wang Yansong, Luo Qinghua, Zhu Wenqi, Chen Songyuan, and Fang Jiaobo for reference. The following are the eight principles that have been passed: (1) Business tax should be based on taxing goods, that is, in the goods sales industry, it can only distinguish the types of business and take the business as the unit, and should not take the goods as the tax unit, so as to avoid the repetition of Likin tax and department store surcharges. (2) The tax does not distinguish between Chinese and foreign merchants, and the tax amount does not distinguish between domestic and foreign goods. (3) The tax rate should be based on the departmental outline as the standard, and special attention should be paid to the four words "luxury business." It does not mean luxury goods. Therefore, except for businesses that are truly luxury businesses or should be banned, all should be taxed at a rate below 2/1000 of the highest amount. In fact, because Shanghai has special circumstances, its tax rate is high and difficult to implement. It is better to have a low tax rate and expect it to be universal. Moreover, Shanghai is a gathering area for commerce, and even if the tax rate is lower, the income must be considerable. (4) Wholesale is taxed at 1/1000 of the purchase price. (5) Zhuangke, who accept entrustment to act as agents, are exempt from business tax. (6) Investigation and collection should be set as two periods. The collection period must be set after the investigation is completed, so that it can be neat and uniform and avoid partiality. (7) The procedures for investigation and reporting should be simple and not trivial, so as not to cause harassment. A detailed method should be discussed. (8) The provisions of the penalty are quite different and there is no draft yet. Attention should be paid first.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories' Plea for Silk Public Bonds to be Discussed</h3>
<p>The silk factory industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, along with foreign-owned silk businesses, has suffered a devastating blow, with capital losses nearly exhausted, threatening total bankruptcy. A public consensus was reached to petition the government to issue ten million yuan in Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk industry public bonds to provide relief. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan's State Council decided to approve only eight million yuan, with two million yuan allocated for fundamental solutions, entrusted to the Ministry of Industry to improve sericulture, and six million yuan to aid silk factories. The regulations and implementation details were submitted to the Legislative Yuan and passed at its regular meeting last Saturday. The bond amount was set at six million yuan, with one-third to be used to incentivize raw silk exports, one-third to improve silk factory machinery, and one-third to improve sericulture. The principal and interest would be repaid by the Ministry of Finance instructing the Jianghai Customs to collect a special tax of twenty-two yuan and five jiao per dan on the export of yellow and white silk from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, starting from the date of bond issuance, as a fund to repay the principal and interest, with a limit of seven and a half years for full repayment of both principal and interest. Since reading the newspaper reports announcing the regulations, silk merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces believe that while these public bonds are nominally for the relief of the silk industry, silk merchants only actually receive one-third, totaling two million yuan. All six million yuan of principal and interest must be repaid by the silk merchants, a burden that is too heavy. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Factory Industry Relief Special Committee has scheduled a temporary discussion meeting for all members at the Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association at 3:00 PM on the 3rd of this month (tomorrow) to solicit public opinion to determine a course of action. A notice has already been issued yesterday.</p>
<h3>Housheng Cotton Mill's Sale to Japanese Interests</h3>
<p>▲ Sale Price: 3.4 Million Taels</p>
<p>▲ Preliminary Agreement Signed the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Guomin News reports that the Housheng Cotton Mill in this city, established for many years, has 20,000 spindles and is a notable domestic enterprise. It has recently been learned that the factory will be sold to the Gongda Cotton Mill, operated by Japanese interests, for a price of 3.4 million taels. It is reported that Mr. Kurachi Shiro, the general manager of the Japanese Gongda Cotton Mill, has visited the factory multiple times and is very satisfied. The preliminary agreement was signed the day before yesterday. It is planned to convert the factory into Gongda Cotton Mill's fine yarn department. It is reported that the Japanese have been affected by the gold standard and silver devaluation in recent years, leading to an increase in domestic unemployment and growing financial instability throughout the country, causing great concern among government and the public. Recently, the Manchurian and Mongolian aggressive policies have caused a great stir, and Japanese industrialists have plans to invest in China and overwhelm Chinese industry. The acquisition of the Housheng Cotton Mill is one of the realizations of this plan. It is reported that various industrial organizations in this city are paying close attention to this matter. Kurachi Shiro will host a reception for Mr. Liu and others at a major hotel the day after tomorrow, hoping for understanding, it is said.</p>
<h3>Compensation for the Xin Daming Incident</h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Currency: 25,000 Yen</p>
<p>▲ Urging the Sato Trading Company to Comply</p>
<p>Regarding the tragic Xin Daming ship incident and the loss of over 300 Chinese lives, the Chinese government has repeatedly negotiated with Japan, but the Japanese side has repeatedly delayed without any sincerity. Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a reply from the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires stating that 25,000 yen in Japanese currency for the Xin Daming disaster victims has been ordered to be paid by the Consul General of Japan in Shanghai, who has instructed the Sato Trading Company to comply. Yesterday, Mr. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, informed the Seamen's General Union of Shanghai of the situation, with the original letter stating: "To the esteemed Union: I am writing in response to the Mayor's instructions regarding your letter requesting information on the negotiations and compensation amount for the Xin Daming case. This case was submitted by the Bureau of Social Affairs to the Municipal Government in November, which then forwarded it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires to urge the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai to quickly take responsibility and order the Sato Trading Company to immediately pay the agreed-upon compensation of 25,000 yen in Japanese currency for the disaster victims to ensure good faith. In December, a reply was received from the Japanese envoy stating that the Sato Trading Company was unable to raise the funds as scheduled due to the adverse market conditions, and therefore had to delay the execution of the contract, requesting understanding. The Bureau of Social Affairs then submitted a report to the Municipal Government, which sent a note to the Japanese envoy, setting a deadline for compliance. On February 11th of this year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied stating that the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires had instructed the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai to urge the Sato Trading Company to comply. All these details have been relayed by the Municipal Government to the Bureau of Social Affairs and are on file. We are accordingly informing you for your information. Sincerely, Yu Hongjun, Acting Secretary-General, Chinese Seamen's Industrial Joint Federation Organizing Committee."</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Society Board Meeting</h3>
<p>▲ Seven Consecutive Seasons of Crop Failure in Shaanxi Province</p>
<p>▲ 10,000 Starved to Death Unburied</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Society held a board meeting yesterday, chaired by Song Hanzhang. Chinese directors Gu Jisheng, Zhu Yinjiang, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Xianqing, Lu Bohong, Lu Weiyong, Chen Liangyu, and others were present, along with Western directors Mei Yisheng and others. The meeting began with discussions of various ongoing matters. Then, Mr. Zhang Xianqing (also a member of the Jisheng Society) reported on his recent personal visit to Shaanxi to investigate the famine relief efforts of the Xi'an Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Society, which have been quite successful. According to reports, Shaanxi usually has two harvests each year, but it has suffered crop failures for seven consecutive seasons. There is currently a severe food shortage. The Jisheng Society has provided relief amounting to over 500,000 yuan, but it is still insufficient. A large sum of relief funds is needed to avert disaster. We recently received a telegram from General Zhu Ziqiao to myself and others, stating that the number of corpses of those who have starved to death is as high as 10,000, and there are no funds to bury them. As the weather warms up, a major epidemic is inevitable. The dead are gone, but what about the living? They will inevitably face another calamity. The situation in Shaanxi is now stable, and relief efforts are timely. All the directors were deeply moved upon hearing this. In addition to the relief funds that have already been sent to Shaanxi, it was decided to raise another 10,000 yuan as soon as possible to be sent to the Shaanxi Society in Xi'an to support spring relief efforts, and to launch a broader fundraising campaign.</p>
<h3>Case of Autopsy at Baolong Hospital</h3>
<p>▲ Written Report from Hospital Director Dr. Perth</p>
<p>Xinsheng News reports that Zhang Wenyi, Battalion Commander of the Garrison Regiment of the Wusong Fortress, was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment due to a ruptured blood vessel in his nose. He died on the 20th of this month after treatment was unsuccessful. The hospital, suspecting that Zhang's condition was not related to blood diseases or blood poisoning, but possibly between Werlhof's disease and pneumonic plague, performed an autopsy for fear of contagion. However, when the deceased's relatives arrived at the hospital the next day, they were greatly shocked and strongly opposed it. The reporter met with Dr. Perth, the director of the hospital, yesterday to discuss the incident. Dr. Perth provided the reporter with a written report, which is excerpted below:</p>
<p>▲ Admission Condition (Medical Report): On February 14, 1931, the patient was admitted to the hospital in critical condition and was treated by Dr. Xu Huacun. I also assisted in the diagnosis and treatment during the most critical stage of the illness. A total of four doctors were involved in the patient's treatment. The patient was a military officer from Wusong who had been in good health. According to the companion in the ward, who was the patient's servant, the patient was in a state of delirium and unable to answer questions clearly. The patient had been bleeding from the teeth and nasal cavity for several days. Due to excessive bleeding, he was quite weak. Various hemostatic agents were used, but they were ineffective. The patient's face was pale, but he had no other pain or cough. The patient usually ate a lot of fruit. When asked if any of the patient's family members had the same symptoms, the servant replied that he had no parents, wife, or other relatives. This was the same answer he gave when I asked repeatedly.</p>
<p>▲ Clinical Examination: The patient was malnourished, his face was extremely pale, there was little fat storage, the mucous membranes were sluggish, there were fine spots of blood on the skin of both legs, and there was significant purpura. There were also purplish-red spots of blood on other parts of the body, such as the chest, abdomen, and arms. The gums and upper and lower jaws were covered with blood scabs, the teeth were normal, and the breath was very foul. The patient was delirious and unable to speak. The lungs showed no significant abnormalities on the first day of examination. Later, small and medium-sized air bubbles and crepitations were found. The heart examination also showed no significant changes or murmurs. The spleen was not enlarged. The blood test results were: hemoglobin 38%, red blood cells 1,290,000, white blood cells 1,300, the differential count of white blood cells showed 45% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 52% lymphocytes, and 3% large mononuclear cells. The platelet count was particularly low. The blood clotting time was seven minutes. Blood cultures initially showed no bacterial growth. On February 21, one day after the patient's death, hemolytic streptococci grew in the cultured blood. This condition is difficult to definitively diagnose, as it is similar to scurvy, Werlhof's disease, blood poisoning, and pneumonic plague in differential diagnosis.</p>
<p>▲ Treatment: The treatment included daily injections of 10% Calcium Chloride and Clanden twice each, Adrenalin was applied to the mucous membranes, Vigamso was taken internally three times a day, ten drops each time, and intravenous glucose solution and cardiac stimulants were administered. Oxygen nebulization and saline enemas were also used. Marbol was taken three times a day. Cold and liquid foods were given, such as agar-agar pudding, raw eggs, liver extract, and orange juice.</p>
<p>▲ Death: Based on the verbal diagnosis, it did not resemble scurvy or blood poisoning, as there was no splenomegaly, the white blood cell count was not particularly low, there was no chills or fever, and the blood culture was sterile. The suspicion was between Werlhof's disease and pneumonic plague. Given this, the corpse and its potential danger could not only spread throughout the hospital, but could also expose the people of Shanghai to a most terrible infectious disease, which must be prevented in advance. This is why the companion, who claimed to be a servant, stated that when he returned to the hospital, the body was in another room.</p>
<p>▲ Autopsy: In order to eliminate the risk of an epidemic and the spread of infection, an autopsy had to be performed. The attendant who claimed to be the deceased's younger brother repeatedly stated that there were no other relatives present. Out of caution, we waited for twenty-five hours, but no relatives came. However, the body was decomposing rapidly, which greatly hindered an accurate diagnosis. Therefore, in order to comply with Chinese law, the hospital had no choice but to perform an autopsy.</p>
<p>▲ Autopsy Report: Autopsy report by Dr. Liang Boqiang, Associate Professor of Pathology, Institute of Pathology, National Tongji University (No. 3, 1931). Pathological Diagnosis: Zhang Wenyi, 25 years old, military officer, severe and extensive ulcerative tonsillitis, affecting both sides equally; multiple new abscesses in the lower lobe of the left lung; petechial hemorrhages on the pericardium; liquid blood in the heart and throughout the blood vessels; a small amount of red and fatty scabs in the right atrium; numerous multiple hemorrhagic gastric mucosal erosions; mucosal hemorrhages throughout the small intestine and the upper part of the large intestine, the renal pelvis and the bladder; general blood disease in various internal organs; skin hemorrhages, more severe in the left lower leg; the foramen ovale in the heart is open; a primary tuberculous complex (in the lungs and hilar lymph nodes); no splenomegaly; no parasites.</p>
<h3>Jisheng Society's Famine Relief in Suizhong County, Liaoning Province: Summary</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society, recognizing the extreme severity of the famine in Suizhong County, Liaoning Province, established three porridge kitchens in Xiaozhuangzi, Daque Zhuang, and Dawang Zhuang. Now, upon receiving the report from Li Shanxiang, who was sent by the Society to investigate the county, it was found that the porridge kitchens were operating very well. However, due to the severity of the disaster and the large population, it was difficult to reach those in remote border areas. It was proposed to change to distributing dry rations to address the immediate need. The Society is now raising an additional 15,000 yuan and has sent a letter to Yu Guisheng, the director of the relief effort in Beiping, and a letter to Yang Zigong, the chairman of the Liaoning, Jilin, Rehe and Hebei Charity Association, to raise an additional 15,000 yuan, totaling 30,000 yuan, to change to distributing dry rations and jointly conduct relief efforts to save the dying disaster victims. The following are excerpts from the original letters of investigation by Mr. Yu and Mr. Shanxiang: (1) There are a total of six porridge kitchens in the county. One is located at the train station, established by the local emergency relief association, feeding 2,700 people daily. One is located in the city's Sanhuang Temple, established by the Wutai Mountain Puji Buddhist Association, feeding 1,500 people. One is located in Tashan Village, established by the Four Provinces Charity Association, feeding 2,800 people. The one established by your esteemed association in Dawang Zhuang feeds approximately 2,800 people daily. The two kitchens in Xiaozhuang and Daque Zhuang each feed approximately 2,200-2,300 people daily. Those who live nearby receive porridge, while those who live far away receive rice, temporarily alleviating the immediate needs. The city is full of desolation, with broken tiles and ruined walls resembling a battlefield, with no intact houses. The crops have failed, and the autumn harvest is not promising. In total, there are 85,000 disaster victims, with approximately 30,000 people having no food or clothing, waiting to die. It is best to distribute dry rations to provide universal relief. Your esteemed society's 11,000 sets of cotton clothing - 3,000 sets are being distributed in Suizhong. Yang Zigong's 1,000 sets of cotton clothing. Your esteemed society's three porridge kitchens are operating very well, and the cotton clothing is being distributed to the poorest disaster victims, providing tangible benefits. It is hoped that relief funds will continue to be provided to allow for both food and clothing relief, so that they can survive this hardship.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Township Farmers' Associations in Various Townships of the Sixth District of the County Yesterday</h3>
<p>Under the supervision of the county's Reorganization Committee, the townships of Maqiao 3, 4, and 5 in the sixth district of Shanghai County organized township farmers' associations, formally holding an inaugural meeting at Qiangshu Elementary School at 1:00 PM yesterday. Prior to the meeting, the county government appointed Wang Chengyao, the district head of the district, to attend as supervisor, and the county's Reorganization Committee sent committee member Jiang Yanchou to attend as guide. After the election was completed, Wang Chengyao, the supervisor, and Jiang Yanchou delivered speeches in succession. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Seventh District Party Department Submits a Request for Interpretation of the Farmers' Association Law</h3>
<p>The Party Department of the Seventh District of this city believes that the preparation for the establishment of farmers' associations in accordance with the law is fraught with obstacles and has specially prepared a document to be submitted to the Municipal Department for forwarding to the Central Government for interpretation. The document states: "The Farmers' Association Law and the Implementing Rules of the Farmers' Association Law have been promulgated and circulated by the National Government one after another, ordering all provinces and cities to reorganize and establish farmers' associations within a specified period. It is found that Article 7 of the Farmers' Association Law states that 'Farmers' associations are divided into township farmers' associations, district farmers' associations, county/city farmers' associations, and provincial farmers' associations.' We humbly believe that this city is directly under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, and its status is actually equal to that of a province. Does the word 'city' in the 'county/city farmers' association' include this city? If the status of this city's farmers' association is the same as that of a county farmers' association, then according to the methods of Shanghai County, there will be district farmers' associations under the county farmers' association, and even lower there will be township farmers' associations. This is because under the administrative area of the county, there are townships under the districts. Now, in the area of this city, there are no townships under the districts, but there are 'fang' (neighborhoods). Should there also be an organization of township farmers' associations, or should the district farmers' association be the basic organization? According to the provisions of Article 13 of the Farmers' Association Law, 'The establishment of a township farmers' association or a city/district farmers' association shall be initiated by fifty or more members with membership qualifications in the area and agreed upon by one-third or more of all members.' Given the breadth of the area and the size of the population in each district of this city, the number of people in each district who meet the membership qualifications of the farmers' association is close to 10,000 (such as in the Pu Song District), and at least 3,000 to 4,000 (such as in the Wusong Pengpu District). In a short period of time, it is not easy to obtain the consent of one-third of them and to complete the investigation and registration procedures. Even if one-third of the consent is forcibly obtained, the members are scattered in all directions, making it extremely difficult to convene them. And the result of gathering hundreds or thousands of untrained farmers in one room is just the formation of a transformed mass rally. What benefit is there to the law? Now, the deadline for the organization of the association is approaching. Simply because the organizational system of the city's farmers' association, which is directly under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, has not yet been clearly defined, the people want to organize but cannot find a way to start. The grassroots level of the association's work feels fraught with obstacles, and there is a need for explanation. Therefore, we submit this document to your esteemed association and forward it to the Central Government, requesting that the aforementioned difficulties be explained so that we can follow them."</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Architects' Meeting of the Lawyers' Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association held a site plan review committee meeting at its clubhouse at the intersection of Beiler Road and Lafayette Road in the French Concession at 10:00 AM yesterday. Committee members Wang Weizhen, Tang Yan, Wu Mai, Liang Bohua, Chen Renlang, and Sheng Zhenwei were present. Executive and supervisory committee members Li Shirui, Chen Zemin, Lu Shaozong, Zhang Feixiong, Zhang Enhuao, Huang Han, Shan Yuhua, Tang Yingsong, Liu Zuwang, Zhao Zuwei, and others, totaling more than 20 people, were in attendance. The meeting was chaired by Chen Renlang, with Dai Jixian recording. After the usual formalities, the chairman had the blueprints of the auditorium circulated for a week. The executive and supervisory committee members in attendance expressed their opinions in turn. All the committee members believed that the association currently has 600 members, and the number of people applying to join in the future will inevitably reach 1,000. According to this plan, it would be difficult to accommodate so many members. As a result of the discussion, because the attending committee members did not have voting rights, it was decided that the meeting place would be redrawn with an expanded plan, with the intention of building a tall Western-style building of seven or eight stories, including the library, school reading room, etc. (following the model of the Bankers' Association). In addition to allocating the necessary rooms in the clubhouse, the remaining rooms will be rented out to others to collect rent. However, since the review committee members were not all present, it was decided to set another date to reconvene the entire review committee.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>The County Urges Household Registration and Personal Registration</h3>
<p>Yan Shenyu, the magistrate of Shanghai County, believes that household registration and personal registration are fundamental to the administration of local self-government, and that citizen oath registration and township elections are important matters in completing the county organization law. He has repeatedly received orders from the Department of Civil Affairs to expedite these matters and has forwarded them to the districts to comply. After receiving the orders, some districts have completed the work and reported it, while others are in the process of expediting the work. However, districts three and six have neither reported the completion of the work nor reported the progress of their compliance. As the matter concerns the fundamental politics of self-government, and the deadline has passed, there can be no further delay. In addition to ordering the district heads to expedite the work, personnel will be dispatched to the districts to supervise the district heads, ensuring that the aforementioned important matters are completed within the shortest possible time, and to ascertain the current status of the work in each district and report back for inspection and verification.</p>
<h3>Business Meeting of the Department Store Industry: Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Department Store Trade Association held a dinner meeting for its members at the Yijia Chun restaurant on Fourth Avenue last night to discuss the business tax issue. Zheng Hairuo was elected chairman and reported that the tax rate set by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for the industry reached 15 per mille, exceeding the general outline by more than seven times, which is beyond the capacity of merchants to bear. Subsequently, Zheng Chengqing, a member of the association's executive committee, reported on various cases, opinions on the business tax, and the steps that the association should take. Guest Sun Mingqi discussed the nature of likin and business tax and pointed out the points that the trade should strive for. Representatives present expressed many opinions. Finally, it was decided to appoint Zheng Hairuo, Zheng Chengqing, Zhang Wei, Cheng Guichu, and Chen Huiqing as five representatives to petition in Beijing, stating that the tax rate should not exceed one per mille, and the method of collection should be based on the business as a unit to prevent harassment.</p>
<h3>Boundary Stones Erected on the Beihui County Road in the Northern Suburbs</h3>
<p>The road surface, bridge, and culvert projects of the Songhu Beihui County Road are nearing completion since their construction began. Now, the Shanghai County Construction Bureau, after calculating the road surface, has determined that the originally planned width of nine meters for land acquisition has been used only seven meters and some change, so there is still land on both sides for future widening. In order to clarify the boundaries between public and private land, Director Fei specially appointed Director Huang of the Road Administration Office and Section Chief Gong of the Technical Section yesterday to supervise the workers in erecting boundary stones on the road. Fearing that the villagers might misunderstand, the county government has issued a public notice.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Foundry Workers' Union</h3>
<p>There are three to four thousand foundry workers in Shanghai's foundries. They once established a public office outside the back gate of the South Railway Station and possessed public property. Recently, the property was sold, and it has been out of operation for a long time. Now, over fifty workers, including Lai Fa and Wang Genrong, have jointly submitted a report to the Municipal People's Training Association, requesting the retrieval of the accounts for re-organization, and re-establishing a trade union to preserve it.</p>
<h3>News of Improved Service on the Songhu Railway</h3>
<p>Since the introduction of steam trains on the Songhu Railway last year, the steam trains have often been delayed and crowded, causing inconvenience to passengers and leading to disappointment. According to investigations, the railway authorities have examined the reasons. It is heard that the steam trains in England use special coal for combustion, but the Songhu Railway still uses ordinary locomotive coal, making it difficult for the steam to evaporate, easily leading to delays and cancellations. The railway bureau has now ordered high-quality coal from the Zhongxing Company to be used for locomotives on both lines and Songhu steam trains. As for the Songhu train schedules, they already exceed the needs, but the section between the North Station and Jiangwan is still extremely crowded. It is heard that the railway bureau will now revise the train schedule, reduce the number of trains on the entire Songhu line, free up vehicles, and add trains between the North Station and Jiangwan. This will also allow for replacement and repairs. Once this improvement plan is implemented, the difficulties of passengers can be completely resolved.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Methods for National Medicine</h3>
<p>Zheng Xiaobo, a leader of the Institute of National Medicine in Shanghai, stated that the Central National Medicine Museum is scheduled to open in the middle of next month. He has submitted 20 years of work to the Propaganda Department to recruit talent. Yesterday, he convened comrades at the Zaisheng Hospital in Yuyang Lane, Pushi Road, to discuss ways to improve Chinese medicine and prepare to go to Beijing to participate in research work.</p>

<h3>Trial Flight of the Beijing-Ping Air Route</h3>
<p>▲ Departed from Hongqiao Airport Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Expected to Arrive in Beiping Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Beijing-Ping air route, which the China National Aviation Corporation has been preparing, conducted a trial flight yesterday. Nie Kaiyi, deputy director of the aircraft navigation section of the company, accompanied by pilot Mr. Zhang, flew a land plane from Hongqiao Airport at 8:00 AM yesterday. The company's personnel gathered at the airport to see them off. The aircraft driven by Nie and others will fly north along the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou railway lines on this trial flight. It is scheduled to fly to Nanjing, stop briefly to refuel, and then continue to Xuzhou for the night. Today, it will continue to fly to Jinan, stop for another night, and then fly to Beiping. If it were a direct flight without stopping, Beijing and Ping could be reached in eight hours. Now, due to inspections along the way, it will take three days.</p>
<h3>Huicheng Qianzhuang Fraud</h3>
<p>▲ Abusing Blank Checks to Defraud Goods</p>
<p>▲ The Store Closed Before the Due Date</p>
<p>Zheng Baoqing, a Ningbo native, rented a market stall at No. 295 Ningbo Road, the intersection of Lloyd Road, after the Lunar New Year and opened the Huicheng Qianzhuang. He abused blank promissory notes to defraud goods and money. Anyone who held the firm’s promissory notes thought the location was peculiar and suspected it was a fraud. They brought the notes to cash them, and the store people always avoided the topic with phrases such as "come to cash them when they are due." This only increased the suspicions of the note holders. The Old Gate Police Station was only a short distance from the store, and they repeatedly received reports from note holders, but they could only consider that the notes were not due, and whether there was any money to cash could not be known, and so they weren't able to take legal action to deal with it. However, Detective Wang Yingjie was sent daily to the front of the store to observe its movements to prevent accidents. Jianhua Department Store at No. 163 Xinji Bang Road also obtained a blank checkbook from the store. Guo Zhangjian, the owner of Jianhua, purchased one hundred bags of white sugar from the Tongshun Seafood Wholesale Store in Dade Lane, North Sichuan Road, for a price of 1,620 taels of silver, and paid with this check, due on February 11. Zhang Liangru, the manager of Tongshun, needed cash and tried to cash the check at Shanghai Bank, Dunyu Qianzhuang, etc., but they were all rejected. Seeing that the address of Huicheng was printed on the back of the check, he took it to Huicheng on the 2nd of this month. The store still told him to come to cash it when it was due. Zhang had no choice but to return. Detective Wang happened to be inspecting the store and encountered him outside of the Huicheng. Unexpectedly, when Wang returned to the store the next day, the doors were tightly closed, and all the employees had fled. Therefore, he began investigating. After Zhang described the origin of the check he obtained, Guo Jianzhang and related persons Tang Wensheng, Chen Rizhao, and woman Zheng Xu were arrested one after another and charged with using fake store checks. The suspects were released on bail of 200 yuan each, except for Zheng Xu, and all the defendants such as Guo were ordered to be detained for continued interrogation and handling by Judge Luo in the Special District Local Court.</p>
<h3>Wuhua Refining &amp; Dyeing Company Murder Case</h3>
<p>Manager Assassinated</p>
<p>▲ Three More Accomplices Apprehended</p>
<p>▲ Further Interrogation Still Required</p>
<p>Xu Guisheng, the manager of the Wuhua Refining &amp; Dyeing Company in Zhabei, was murdered in his bedroom at 4:00 AM on January 4th. Subsequently, the responsible police precinct arrested two suspects, Zhou A'wu and Zhao Ruixing. Zhou was a shop worker from Wuhua, and Zhao was an apprentice. Later, based on Zhao's confession, in conjunction with the Huishan Police, they arrested three more people at No. 2957 Zhoujiazu Road and No. 1 Henan Road: Zhang Genhe from Wuxi, Ding A'san, and Xu Daosheng from Ningbo. However, Zhao claimed that Zhang was actually Zhu Shaochuan under an alias, that Ding was also Kong Mingyue under an alias, and that Xu's real name was Zhao Jinghua.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the police escorted the three to the Special District Local Court, and the Public Security Bureau sent personnel to bring Zhao to the court as a witness, hoping to obtain a transfer order after the evidence was presented. Judge Feng opened the court for interrogation and ordered Zhao Ruixing to be questioned. According to Zhao's testimony, he was from Dongting Mountain and was an apprentice at Wuhua. At the time of the incident, he had gotten up to urinate when he saw Zhou A'wu holding a hatchet. When he asked Zhou what he was doing, Zhou told him to go back to sleep and not to say anything more. Soon after, he heard a knock on the door and got up again to peek. Four people came together. These four people were the three defendants who had been apprehended and a person surnamed Zhu. Zhu was also holding a hatchet and watching him very closely, so he did not dare to make a sound. After a while, Zhou A'wu took a bundle of banknotes from the manager's room and divided it among the three apprehended individuals, totaling 1,400 yuan. The remaining 2,000 yuan was ordered to be hidden in a pile of newspapers. After Zhou was arrested, the three apprehended individuals came again to take the 2,000 yuan to divide it up, but he did not give it to them. On the 24th of the lunar December, he specially had the person surnamed Zhu deliver 200 yuan to the three defendants. Zhu is still at large, and so on.</p>
<p>When Zhang Genhe was questioned, he denied that his name was Zhu Shaochuan and claimed to work at the Xiangxing Iron Factory and did not know Zhao. He said that he had returned to his home in Shilitang Town on the day of the incident and had nothing to do with it. Xu Daosheng also denied the name Zhao Jinghua and claimed that he had been working as a servant in the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department for two years. At the time of the incident, he was sharing a bed with a colleague surnamed Wang in the Health Department's writing room. Ding A'san stated that he worked at the Xiangyu Factory and was not named Kong Mingyue, nor did he know Zhao, and that he was being falsely accused.</p>
<p>The police lawyer stated that the names provided by Zhao were mostly inconsistent with those of the apprehended individuals, making it difficult to prove. He requested that Zhou A'wu be brought to court for further interrogation. The court granted the request and ordered the three defendants to be remanded in custody pending further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Record of a Fierce Daughter-in-Law Beating Her Father-in-Law</h3>
<p>▲ Assaulting a Collateral Relative and False Accusation</p>
<p>▲ Combined Sentence of Eleven Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Ling Zhongfu, a native of Nantongzhou who opens two flower shops, Ling Fuxing and Ling Futai, on Tianjin Road Hongmiao Lane, is 73 years old. Due to his old age and weakness, he divided the two shops among his two sons. The eldest son, Youqiao, received Ling Fuxing, and the second son, Yueqiao, received Ling Futai. Each shop had a capital of 10,000 to 20,000 gold coins. After Zhongfu divided the shops, he lived separately at No. 62 Tangjiawei, with his two sons each providing him with 20 yuan per month as support. Later, due to the rising cost of living, this was increased to 26 yuan, and for many years, they lived in peace. However, Yueqiao's wife, Tao, was of a fierce and impetuous nature and had an opium addiction, which led to financial difficulties. Last November in the lunar calendar, she was unable to pay her father-in-law's monthly fee. On the morning of the 12th of last month, Zhongfu went to Ling Futai to ask Ling Tao for the November monthly fee (as she managed the money). Unexpectedly, she not only refused to give it to him but also spoke abusively and angrily cursed him, using door bolts and other objects to strike Zhongfu, causing severe injuries to his head, face, and chest. He was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by ambulance and has only recently recovered somewhat. He personally reported the incident to the Old Zhabei Police Station, which sent detectives to arrest Tao. The day before yesterday morning, she was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court.</p>
<p>The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that in addition to violating Article 293 of the Criminal Code for assaulting a direct relative, the police also accused her of violating Article 180 of the Criminal Code for false accusation. It was reported that Gao Chonghou and Liu Liansheng were apprentices in the shop. On the evening of the 18th of this month, the defendant suddenly went to the Old Zhabei Police Station and reported that Gao and Liu had stolen four gold rings and four counters while she was not in the shop on the 16th. The police sent detectives to arrest them, but they could not be found. Yesterday, Gao suddenly surrendered to the police station, stating that the woman's accusations were completely fabricated. He claimed that the four counters were sold on her orders, and the gold rings were never seen. The detective learned that Gao had previously deposited 80 yuan with Tao and later retrieved 40 yuan. Tao then ordered Gao to sell the four counters to get money to repay the debt. As for the woman going to the police station to accuse Gao of theft, it was either because Gao did not help her when she was beating her father-in-law, and she harbored resentment, wanting to retaliate. Today, the plaintiff and witnesses have been summoned to the court.</p>
<p>He requested an investigation. Ling Zhongfu submitted a complaint about being beaten, stating that his chest still hurt when he coughed and requesting severe punishment and compensation for medical expenses of 15 yuan. He then submitted the medical certificate for inspection. The neighbors Zhu Lian, Hu A'lai, Fan Yimin, and Xu Zhoushi testified that the defendant did indeed violently beat the plaintiff with wooden flowers at the time, and blood flowed from his face and other parts of his body like a river. When questioned, the defendant's confession was cunning and she denied the accusations, hiring a lawyer to defend her. The police lawyer stated that the plaintiff in this case was 73 years old and could not withstand such a severe beating, while the defendant was in her prime and dared to use wooden flowers to throw at the plaintiff. Fortunately, she did not hit any vital areas. If she had accidentally hit the brain, it would have undoubtedly resulted in death. Therefore, the defendant actually wanted to cause the plaintiff's death, and her intentions were extremely vicious. If she is not severely punished, how can we deter disobedient behavior?</p>
<p>Without waiting for the lawyers of both parties to finish their arguments, Chief Judge Zhou Hanting ruled in court that Ling Tao was sentenced to 10 months of imprisonment for the crime of assaulting a collateral relative and 2 months of imprisonment for the crime of false accusation, to be served concurrently for a total of 11 months. She was also ordered to compensate Ling Zhongfu 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tragic Car Accident</h3>

As they were driving back from Mingyuan, when they reached the intersection of Baoding Road and Tangshan Road, car No. 12342 suddenly drove from the opposite direction. Neither party could react in time, and the two cars collided. Car No. 17846 immediately flipped over, and Du Linrong was thrown out of the car, suffering the most severe injuries. A woman and two children in car No. 12342, as well as the passengers in the Xingfa car, were all injured to varying degrees. They were taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment by ambulance. However, Du Linrong succumbed to his injuries and died in the hospital at around 3:00 AM last night.</p>

<p>▲ Left Foot Severely Crushed</p>
<p>Wang Qiguang, a student at the Patriotic Girls' School on Jiangwan Chenyuan Road, was returning to school from Shanghai yesterday afternoon when she crossed the Songhu Railway. A light train happened to be speeding by, and she was unable to avoid it in time, resulting in her being knocked down onto the tracks. Her left foot was severely crushed. She was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by workers who hired a car. Her life is not in danger.

<h3>Demolition of the Five Saints Temple in the Gaolu District Begins</h3>
<p>The Five Gods Temples are visible everywhere in various rural areas of this city, and the general rural people worship them exceptionally, spending a huge amount of money every year. In view of this, the Second Direct District Sub-Division of this city submitted a request to demolish more than 100 Five Gods Temples in the entire Caojing area. The Eleventh Sub-Division of the Fifth District, for further consideration, submitted a request to demolish all Five Saints Temples in the entire district to thoroughly eliminate them. The municipal government has instructed the Public Security Bureau and the Social Bureau to handle the matter together with the municipal commissioners of each district. It is reported that dozens of Five Saints Temples in the Gaolu districts of Pudong have been hired by the Third District and Fifth Precinct of the Public Security Bureau and started demolition.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Fifth Zhongshan Road Bridge</h3>
<p>The Fifth Zhongshan Road Bridge, built by the Municipal Public Works Bureau, straddles both sides of the Zhabei Tanzi Port. The bridge piers are made of cement, and the bridge deck is paved with thick wood. Construction began in October last year and has now been completed and is open to traffic. However, vehicles weighing over 12 tons are not allowed to pass. Currently, the roads at both ends of the bridge are being rushed to be built.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Stalls on Yongxing Road Relocated Yesterday</h3>
<p>The vegetable stalls set up at both ends of Yongxing Road on Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei were found by the Municipal Health Bureau to be located on a major thoroughfare, with dirty water everywhere and a foul odor, which not only hindered pedestrians and affected hygiene but also obstructed traffic. Therefore, the Bureau specially obtained approval from the Fourth District Public Security Bureau to order the relocation. Subsequently, the stallholders and shops, etc., jointly signed and sealed a request for a postponement, as it was difficult to recover outstanding debts after the lunar New Year. The district, in consideration of the merchants' difficulties, limited the extension to the end of February. Yesterday was the deadline, but the stallholders were still setting up as usual. After investigation by the district, health inspectors Zhou and Su, assisted by patrol officers Wang and Chen from the Zhongxing Road Police Station, carried out the relocation at around 11:00 AM. Within an hour, all the vegetable stalls were completely closed down. However, Ding Jinxing, who set up a tofu stall, resisted and refused to comply because his son-in-law drove a car for a certain gentleman in the Public Security Bureau and had the business card of Inspector Cao Chengqing. He was taken to the Fourth District for questioning. It is reported that from today onwards, all the stallholders must set up stalls at No. 2 places, Taiyangmiao Road and Jingjiang Road.</p>
<h3>Water Patrol Team Seizes Opium in Huangpu River</h3>
<p>The Water Patrol Team of the Huangpu River dispatched police officers Zhao Xiwu and others to patrol the Nanhuangpu area the day before yesterday. When they patrolled in front of the Longhua Cement Factory, they saw a Zhujiaxing boat sailing from east to west and went to inspect it. They found a suspicious net basket and searched it, discovering 114 small packets of opium inside. They arrested the boat crew member Pan A'rong. Unexpectedly, Pan immediately borrowed 74 yuan from the accountant Ni Jixiao and attempted to bribe the officers. As a result, the police took Ni into custody as well. After investigating, they found that Ni Jixiao was not related to the case and released him immediately. Pan A'rong and others were sent to the Public Security Bureau and yesterday were handed over to the Local Court for questioning.</p>

An ambulance from the Xinzha Fire Brigade was carrying a sick grandson to the Red Cross Hospital when it was driving along Jing'an Temple Road, heading east towards Xiaoshadu Road. Suddenly, three cars drove from the west, with No. 2762 in the front and Nos. 12330 and 3619 following behind No. 2762. Due to the excessive speed of each car, an accidental collision occurred. The ambulance collided with the front of car No. 2762. Due to the strong impact, car No. 2762 rushed out of the road after the collision, and the ambulance also lost control and collided with cars No. 12330 and 12619. The front and body of each car were damaged. Fortunately, no one in the cars was injured.</p>
<h3>Shrew Repeatedly Beats Husband's Brother</h3>
<p>▲ And Turns Anger on Others</p>
<p>Xia Qingjin, a native of Hubei who works at the Minli Zhan Inn in the French Concession, went to his aunt's house on Qianxin Street to pay New Year's greetings with his two sisters-in-law, Xia Ke and Xia Ji, a few days ago. They had dinner there and played mahjong. Unexpectedly, Xia had a conflict with his sisters-in-law due to a mistake in the game. Xia Ji slapped Xia Qingjin several times. Xia did not argue with his sisters-in-law because they were family members and left in anger. At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Xia and his three sisters-in-law coincidentally went to their aunt Xia Heng's house at No. 7 Gaodun Road in the city to reason things out. Unexpectedly, a disagreement arose, and the two sisters-in-law beat Xia again. Although his aunt tried to mediate, it was ineffective. The two landlords, Cheng Chen and Wang Wang, heard the commotion and got up to mediate, but the sisters-in-law mistakenly thought they were pretending to mediate and turned their anger on them, resulting in a chaotic fight with bloodshed. The cries for help reached outside the house. The neighbor called Wang Kunhe, a guard from the First Precinct of the Second District, who took Xia Qingjin and the other six people to the station for questioning by Director Xu.</p>

<h3>Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Decides to Raise Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Association, due to the recent high cost of gold and silver and the increase in the prices of various raw materials, has raised the price of various dyes by 5 liang per yuan since January of this year. However, it is still not enough to cover the costs.

<h3>Dong Zixing's Concubine, Yin Changfa, Claims to be his Legal Wife</h3>
<p>▲ Dong Accused of Seizing Legal Wife</p>
<p>▲ Chen A'yuan Invited to Testify, Denies Claim</p>
<p>Dong Zixing, a Ningbo native and the owner of a clock shop, and his concubine, Chen A'yuan, live together at No. 564 Juxing Lane, Baike Road. Recently, Yin Changfa, a Tongzhou native stranded at sea, accused Dong of seizing his legal wife and assault causing injury in the Special District Local Court. The person referred to as his legal wife is Chen A'yuan. The day before yesterday afternoon, the Special Court summoned both parties, and Judge Ge interrogated them. According to Yin, he is 47 years old. In August of the first year of the Republic of China, he married A'yuan through matchmakers Liu Jinrong and Xu Fusheng. However, Liu is already dead, and Xu's whereabouts are unknown. On the fourth day of the ninth lunar month of the second year of the Republic of China, I committed a crime and was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment by Nanhui County. At that time, A'yuan was six months pregnant. On the seventh day of the third lunar month of the following year, she came to visit me in prison, carrying an infant who was two months old. This child is now also possessed by Dong. From the winter of the fifth year of the Republic of China, A'yuan stopped communicating with me. Later, I was released after serving my sentence and inquired about her. It was not until the twenty-fifth day of the lunar New Year two years ago that I saw A'yuan and Dong passing by in a car on Baike Road. I immediately stopped them, intending to inquire about everything. Unexpectedly, Dong ordered his driver to violently beat me, knocking me to the ground. They took the opportunity to escape. After my injuries healed, I became ill, and I procrastinated until now before filing a lawsuit, requesting strict punishment, etc.</p>
<p>When Chen A'yuan was questioned, she stated that she was 36 years old, originally from Chuansha, and her original husband was not the plaintiff but Xue A'hua, a former neighbor, and she was a uxorilocal marriage. They married on the sixth day of the second lunar month of the first year of the Republic of China. In January of the third year of the Republic of China, they divorced in the French Concession and became involved in litigation.

<h3>The First Battle of the Season for the Chinese Football Team</h3>
<p>▲ Lost to the Western Prison Team with a score of 0-1</p>
<p>丨The team still lacks cooperation丨</p>
<p>To practice their formation in preparation for participating in the International Cup, the Chinese football team played against the Western Prison Team, the current champion of the Western Association Group A, at the Chinese baseball field yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. More than 10,000 people watched around the field.</p>
<p>This is a new record in this year's football games.</p>
<p>▲ The Reasons for the Defeat</p>
<p>Both sides had sufficient forces and outstanding talent, and it was expected that the 90-minute battle would arouse immense excitement and stimulation. However, in reality, the players of both teams were exhausted after a major battle the day before. Although they wanted to push harder, their strength was insufficient. As for the Chinese team's 0-1 defeat, there were various reasons. The most prominent was that the opposing team was a unified team, with procedures and steps in all directions, whether advancing, retreating, attacking, or defending. The Chinese team, on the other hand, was a temporary formation, a motley crew, so how could they defeat a well-trained army? Furthermore, the two wings were weak and unable to shake the enemy's formation, and direct attacks in the center were difficult to succeed. Among the five forwards, Chen Zhenhe stood out, dominating for a while, while Dai Linjing and Chen Yutian's performances were lackluster, seemingly not displaying their usual talents. Mei Hongbao entered the battle with a foot injury and withdrew shortly afterward. The two wings, Chen Zhenxiang and Chen Bingxiang, were weak and showed no performance at all. The three members of the center back line, Zhuang, Chen, and Liang, were excellent, but even they showed gaps in the second half. The inside backs, Feng and Li, each displayed their brilliance and were ultimately extraordinary. However, overall, they were not as organized as the Zhenru team from the previous day.</p>
<p>▲ The Course of the Fierce Battle</p>
<p>At the beginning of the battle, the Chinese team fought bravely against the enemy, which was shocking. The center back line resisted dutifully, and the forwards attacked powerfully, but the opponent's defense was sound, and they often retreated halfway. The Western Prison Team occasionally counterattacked, but it was difficult to break through. In the first half, neither side achieved anything. At the beginning of the second half, Chen Zhenhe rushed out and was about to score when an enemy general tripped him, resulting in a free kick. Chen Zhenhe aimed towards the right, and Chen Zhenxiang jumped up for a header, but Turner kicked it high into the sky, saving the goal. The momentum then shifted, invading from the right and then turning to the center. Wei Jinsheng faced an open goal and succeeded in one fell swoop. The Chinese team was one goal behind and attacked even more forcefully, but without success despite repeated attempts. As a result, the Western Prison Team won 1-0. The referee was Li Silian.</p>

<h3>A Word or Two · Qiu · Shui</h3>
<p>▲ If current love is as withered as the current market, and you don't get any benefits after marriage, then the reason is naturally the same as the decline of industry.</p>
<p>▲ If you don't get married, then just imagine how much hardship and disappointment you would escape if you didn't enter the world.</p>
<p>▲ Eating often gives you indigestion. Office work often gives you headaches. Love and marriage often cause a lot of heartache. However, life is not complete without one of them.</p>
<p>▲ Philosophers say that life is about seeking happiness. I say that life is about seeking trouble.</p>
<p>▲ When an ambitious person studies a subject, he prepares to struggle with hardship and trouble. He does not expect to immediately gain fame as soon as he leaves the study.</p>
<p>▲ People with money don't like to flaunt it. People with knowledge don't like to seek fame. Therefore, those who read English subtitles while watching movies are often not people who are very good at English.</p>
<p>▲ Be wary of the taciturn, because his skills are in his heart. The sharp-tongued are not to be feared, because his skills are on his tongue.</p>
<p>▲ Don't eat all the food you have. Don't enjoy all the blessings you have. Life must seek happiness in dissatisfaction, so that the happiness can last.</p>
<p>▲ The lunar and solar calendars are essentially the same, but the psychology of the masses is different. Therefore, to fundamentally abolish the lunar calendar, one should start with the psychology of the masses. What the Premier said about psychological construction is this meaning.</p>
<h3>Returning from Jinan · Yu Jianhua</h3>
<p>Jinan is located at the intersection of North and South and has the beauty of mountains and rivers. It was originally very rich, but unfortunately, in recent years, it has been affected by military affairs and ravaged by strong neighbors, resulting in commercial depression and the people's livelihood declining. Occasionally returning home to visit relatives, one cannot help but feel a sense of the changes in the mountains and rivers from the past to the present. When I came to the South in the summer of last year, it was still occupied by the Jin army, and everything was in disarray. Soon, it was recovered by the National Army. At the end of the Gengwu year, I returned to my hometown to visit relatives. What I saw and felt was quite refreshing. I jot down these miscellaneous notes to substantiate this talk.</p>
<p>Chairman Han Fuqu follows the rules of a soldier and uses the means of politics. Although he has not been able to fully satisfy everyone, he can work hard to govern, not hesitating to exert himself. He has rectified the officials and restrained the army, so that the local area is slightly more peaceful and the common people are not alarmed, which is especially commendable. Moreover, he personally presides over the spirits of those who died in battle, and when inspecting various public affairs, he travels by bicycle. All public officials wear uniforms made of blue cloth.</p>
<h3>A Tragedy in the Overseas Love Field · Jiang · Ya · Ying</h3>
<p>There are two young girls in the Czech Republic who have a close friendship. They share meals and lodging every day and always go in and out together. Recently, they both fell in love with a handsome young man named Ge Dingnai, a government official in the Czech Republic. The young man was also deeply in love with both girls. The degree of love was equally balanced. If he married Girl A, he couldn't bear to part with Girl B; if he married Girl B, he couldn't bear to part with Girl A. If he married both girls, he would be limited by the law. Although both girls outwardly expressed their willingness to step aside to help him achieve a beautiful outcome, in reality, neither was willing to give up to sacrifice her own happiness. However, although the two girls were in the position of rivals, their friendship remained strong. Thus, a tragedy arose from this.</p>
<p>One day, the three publicly discussed the matter. Both girls volunteered to be sentenced to death, saying that it was better to die than to suffer mental pain. Helpless, the young man expressed his sympathy. They went to Qibai Mountain together to seek death. On the way, they entered a hostel and had a wild time, with a gathering for meals and then singing and dancing. Late at night, they reached the top of the mountain. The two girls argued to die first. At this time, the three embraced and cried bitterly. The young man's mind was already dazed. He fired his gun and killed one of them. Girl B snatched the gun and attempted to commit suicide. The young man shot her again and killed her. Then he went down the mountain and turned himself in to the police station. On the day of the court hearing, the spectators were packed like a wall. The Czech government specially ordered female judges to be prohibited from participating, because Ge Dingnai looked like Pan An. Women would fall in love with him upon seeing him, and the female judges might have acts of protection. On the day of the trial, the result was only a sentence of ten years in prison. However, considering the crime of killing two people, it can be said to be the lightest of the light.</p>
<p>and there are no classes. They especially have egalitarian ideas. In view of the May 3rd Massacre, they implemented the demolition of the city. Now the West Gate is gone. What used to be extremely crowded is now spacious enough to gallop through. The Licheng Prison has been useless for a long time since judicial independence. It is now also being demolished and converted into a public sports field. The Provincial Education Association has been converted into a public theater. The library has also innovated its methods, adding new and old books and not charging admission fees, so there are many readers, unlike before when there was no one. In the social aspect, there were many divorce cases at the beginning. The Women's Association had almost no free time. Later, a strong woman requested a divorce and was whipped by the chairman, and the trend of divorce stopped. Abolishing the lunar New Year and continuing to work as usual was not tolerated at all. There was no sound of firecrackers on New Year's Eve, but merchants closing their businesses and residents celebrating the New Year were not prohibited. Jinan City and Licheng County had a long-standing dispute over the division of boundaries. Later, after the Director of the Bureau of Finance, Zhao Xinghai, earnestly requested, the urban area was reduced, and the boundary was just determined when the city was abolished.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Discovery of Ancient Tombs in Yueqing · Zhou Lifu</h3>
<p>The eastern mountain of Huangtang in Yueqing, Zhejiang, is mostly yellow soil. People in the vicinity often take soil from the mountain for work. Over the years, it has become very uneven, and the yellow soil has been exhausted. On February 1st of this year, an ancient tomb (whether it is an ancient tomb remains to be verified) was discovered on the southern slope of the mountain. The entrance of the tomb can only accommodate one person. Entering it, it is about ten feet high, seven or eight feet wide, and as long as it is high. The top, bottom, and four sides are all built with rectangular bricks. The bottom is flat and the top is semi-circular. A person is inside, and the empty echo is stored. Coughing cannot escape. The bricks are about one foot long, half as wide, and about two inches thick. The sides are engraved with the words "Yonghe tenth year, Taisui Jiayin, August" and "Yonghe eleventh year, July," etc., with occasional carvings of dragons and phoenixes or swastikas. Examining the ancient emperors of our country who used Yonghe as the era name, there are many. Judging from the words Jiayin, it is consistent with the Guichou of the Lantingji Preface. Then this tomb seems to have been built in the Jin Dynasty. If it is Later Qin or Northern Liang (Yao Hong of Later Qin and Juqu Mujian of Northern Liang both used Yonghe), their power was all biased in the northwest corner. Yueqing is a small town located in the southeast, and it may not have followed its reign. As for Later Han (Emperor Shun of Later Han also used Yonghe), it was not far from ancient times. Its script was either seal script or official script (Wang Cizhong of Later Han first used official script to create regular script, called regular official script). The brick carvings are purely in regular script, and the writing is simple and vulgar, not like ancient works. Then it can be undoubtedly said that it is not Yonghe of Emperor Shun. On the day the tomb was discovered, countless people came from far and near to watch. I also went to explore it in person, so I was able to understand all the circumstances in detail. This kind of historical site should be preserved. Unfortunately, visitors competed to obtain bricks as souvenirs and spared no effort in excavating. Finally, the bricks were exhausted, and several ancient porcelain objects were found, one of which was a chamber pot, light green in color and shaped like a lion, and the manufacturing was very skilled. One was a brush washer and ancient bowls, etc. There were also several silver and iron objects, which had rotted. I regretted that its original state could not be preserved, so I turned to the villagers and begged for a complete brick, which I put in a box and briefly recorded the circumstances of the discovery to provide research for archaeologists.</p>
<h3>A Humorous Prediction · Fei Wenbao</h3>
<p>▲ China After the Second World War</p>
<p>The rising price of gold and the increase in unemployment. The decline of commerce throughout the world. The perilous state of Southern Europe. All have created the possibility of a grand war. The German Rodendorf once published an article with detailed predictions about the motives, date of outbreak, and situation after the Second European War. However, what will be the situation and position of China after this war? I am not talented, so I will make the following predictions:</p>
<p>(1) Abolish Unequal Treaties and Recover Concessions: During the Manchu Qing Dynasty, Sun Yat-sen, as a commoner, strongly advocated overthrowing the Manchu Qing. As a result, the imperial system was overthrown and the Republic of China was established. During the height of Wu Peifu's power, the tiger advocated the Northern Expedition. As a result, the Northern Expedition was victorious and unification was achieved. China, currently under the oppression of the powers, wants to abolish unequal treaties according to the rule that weak countries have no diplomacy. It seems impossible. However, Lao Tzu said, "The strong and violent do not die well." The Second World War will cause the powers to fight each other and be unable to take care of themselves. The unequal treaties will automatically be canceled, and the concessions will be recovered at the same time. Land prices in the concessions may plummet. The houses built by capitalists will be empty and increase, and there will inevitably be a day when they automatically reduce rents to attract tenants. Sun Yat-sen's ideas of equal land rights and regulation of capital will also be realized.</p>
<p>(2) Hire Workers to Construct and Spread Seeds in the Northwest: Chinese people have the temperament of mandarins. They only know how to use materials and do not know how to invent them. After this war, all the great inventors and engineers from various countries will come east to seek food due to economic unrest. China will extend them to be consultants for everything in construction. At the same time, after the war, there will be too many deaths, and the number of women in Europe will be several times greater than the number of men. China will have a large number of men going abroad to spread seeds. What Westerners call the "Yellow Peril" is actually a misnomer for "Yellow Fathers." If you don't believe me, please look to the future (but you will be rewarded).</p>
<h3>A Commendable Elementary School Student · Cai Liang</h3>
<p>My friend, Mr. Huang, teaches in Qianxi. A few days ago, he visited my humble abode on business and told me about a student in his school who worked while studying. I found it quite interesting, so I recorded it to inspire the world.</p>
<p>The student's surname is Xu, and his name is Zhaorui. He is only twelve years old and loves to learn. He always tops his peers in every exam. However, he is troubled by his family's circumstances and sometimes stops studying. His family only has an old father who relies on him selling cakes for a living. Therefore, he must come to school in the morning. In the afternoon, he carries a bamboo basket on his shoulder and roams the streets, shouting to sell cakes, even in wind and rain. Because he is good at understanding people's intentions, his business is particularly prosperous. He sometimes has a book in his hand, sits on the street, and recites as he pleases, looking extremely happy. When he returns home, he always buys delicious food to serve his parents. The family is reunited, and their joy is truly harmonious. I named him a model elementary school student because he supports his parents like Zilu and loves to learn like Cheng Gong, to be an example for all students.</p>
<p>Cai Liang said that elementary school students can support themselves and work hard while studying. Although it is pitiful, it is actually commendable. Compared to the current generation of纨袴子弟, who wear silk and eat rich food, spending money like water and not knowing what studying is for, the difference between the wise and the foolish is vast.</p>
<h3>A New Chronicle of Leaving the Soul · Jian Wen</h3>
<p>Old Man Zhou of Taihe, a Qingming经, had a family of modest means. He was over the age of ears</p>
<p>Shun and was honest by nature. He lived in the western village of Taihe. Taihe has always been plagued by bandits, especially the western village. Villagers with a little wealth mostly moved into the city to avoid the flames of bandits. Old Man Zhou said, "Bandits also have their way. They use violence, and I use benevolence and righteousness. There is nothing that cannot be reformed." He never moved. People laughed at his stubbornness, but he did not care. One night, bandits did visit. Old Man Zhou opened the door, intending to greet them, but the bandits suspected he was prepared and greeted him with bullets. Old Man Zhou fell in response. His family all fled. The bandits looted and left. The next morning, the family returned and found Old Man Zhou dead. Although they were saddened by his untimely death, they blamed it on his own fault and buried him. At the time when Old Man Zhou was shot, a child surnamed Zhang in Baixia, only nine years old, fell into a coma due to a serious illness. He woke up in the middle of the night. Someone pointed to the Zhang couple and asked them to identify him to ease his mind. He replied, "I was shot by bandits. Why am I not dead?" His voice was like an adult's. Zhang suspected he was delirious and accused him falsely. He then recounted his family history and the circumstances of encountering the bandits, which was the previous life of Old Man Zhou. Old Man Zhou was skilled in calligraphy and painting. He was given writing materials, and his brushstrokes produced烟云 between his elbows. Zhang was surprised. He then agreed to his request to return to He to investigate. When Old Man Zhou arrived home, he described in detail the surnames of his children and the circumstances of his death at the hands of the bandits, without the slightest error. His family was shocked, weeping and bowing around him. Zhang was amazed. From then on, the two families had close relations. Battalion Commander Xi Zhen of Haozhou, who had witnessed this, was surprised by the event and informed the reporter. This is specially recorded to inform scholars who are concerned about the soul.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Nanyang (127) · Ling Hua</h3>
<p>Old Man Chen wanted to test his plan. He used 100,000 yuan for the experiment, gathering people in a certain place south of Mandalay to carry it out for several years. It failed, and his wealth was lost. It is said that the reason was that Old Man Chen's charter stipulated that one-third of the earnings would go to the public, but those who came aimed to make profits to support their families and were unwilling to contribute to the public, which led to people scattering. However, after the failure, Old Man Chen's life savings of 100,000 gold were gone in an instant. Seeing him, he showed no regret or stinginess, just a smile. It can be said that he was a great man who, though illiterate, had the ideas of Plato's ideal republic. After the failure, Old Man Chen made a comeback. He was good at business and raised pigs in the mountains for two or three years, earning another 30,000 to 40,000 gold, which supported his family's modest prosperity. Unfortunately, last year he suddenly encountered the Eight Burmese bandits who held him at gunpoint and robbed him, and he died from his injuries. It is said that Burmese people are jealous of the wealth of the Chinese, just as the Chinese view Europeans in China. However, the traces of Old Man Chen's operation of the new village can still be found. I believe that all those who run new villages in ancient times have failed, mostly because they value the goodness of people and forget the evil of people, view people too highly, and do not know that people's selfishness is innate and not easy to break. She compares and judges human nature based on experience. There are more bad things than good things. There are two or three good things, and six or seven bad things. This is why there are fewer times of order and more times of chaos in ancient times. I have gained insight into human society from a practical perspective, and I dare to assert that society has organization, but humanity has no equality. I dare say that this is an iron law. Some say, "You have studied the teachings of Tolstoy and Kropotkin for many years and regard them as classics. Why do you say this?" I say that their words are the wishes of benevolent people. They can be used for education and as theorems of geometry to be applied. If you really insist on applying the theorems of geometry to achieve reality, it is not easy to see them come to fruition. There are indeed many contradictions in life, which must be known. As for Old Man Chen's public life manuscript, Lian Qing has it. Wait to find it for research. His merits cannot be erased. It is said that Old Man Chen held on firmly, believing that if his theory was used, the government could be dispensed with. He once enthusiastically wanted to petition the government to promote it. Unfortunately, if I had come a year earlier, I would have met him. Although his new village failed, it is still a great man in the history of new villages, worth ten thousand times more than a miser who leaves 100,000 to his children. And I advocate that new villages should be built universally, like promoting schools, but occasional failures are like a certain shop closing down, which is a common occurrence for merchants and not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>At four o'clock in the morning on the fifth day, take a small boat back to Miao Nie, the price is twelve Anna, which is forty-eight copper coins. Return to Bassein at two o'clock in the afternoon and arrive at six o'clock.</p>
<p>6th. The centripetal force is quite weak. Suddenly reading Turgenev's poem T urgenell made my mind feel great. From the 5th to the 7th, there were three days for the Burmese Lantern Festival, which is the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the dry season. The Burmese hold lantern fairs, hanging lanterns all over the streets, a bit like our Lantern Festival. But I have horse, rabbit, and other lanterns with many designs. The Burmese are too honest and have fewer designs. All the big and small cities in Burma have great pagodas, which are temples.</p>

<h3>Financial News Last Week's Confusing Gold Market</h3>
<p>▲Constantly Changing: Last week's gold market was extremely chaotic, far more so than the previous week. Changes occurred in an instant, making it exceptionally difficult to predict. Fluctuations of over twenty taels were seen on distant days, causing unusual anxiety. The market initially appeared to be shrouded in a fog, then became robust, only to trend towards stability and softness, even breaking through the 770 tael mark. However, the final result was a slight increase, mainly due to rumors of impending cash exports and various conflicting international news, which incited speculation among traders, resulting in extremely large fluctuations. From Tuesday's lowest price of 734.5 taels to Thursday's highest price of 79 taels, there was a difference of 55.5 taels within these six days. Overall, there was an increase of seven taels. However, the overseas silver market and the Shanghai exchange rate moved in the opposite direction. Large bars increased by 3.125 to 3.75, the silver price increased by 0.75, and the exchange rate rose by two grades (equivalent to half a penny in British gold). The Japanese exchange rate fell by more than 6.25 fen, mainly because the gold industry largely exported British gold for arbitrage, resulting in a departure of approximately 40 to 30 plus taels. Even based on the settlement price of the Japanese exchange rate, a deduction of 60 to 70 taels was still required, with the largest deduction exceeding 90 taels. As for spot goods, there was slight movement, hence the increase in the forward spread, with the term premiums increasing by six or seven taels. Recent trading volume at the exchange amounted to approximately 36,000 bars. A summary of the week's situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Rise of Seven Taels: Starting from Monday (February 23rd), large bars returned to a rise of 0.25, the silver price increased by one fen, and the British exchange rate rose by one and a half grades. The April gold price opened at 757 taels, immediately falling by 2.5 taels. Afterwards, large players aggressively bought, soaring beyond ten taels, reaching 69.5 taels. Furthermore, due to rumors regarding Sino-American loans causing anxiety, the market rapidly turned weak, plummeting by over thirty taels, reaching 39 taels by noon. The market then showed signs of rising, with news spreading that cash could be loaded onto ships, causing a sudden increase of ten taels. The afternoon saw continued gains, reaching 52 taels, with the market closing at 48.5 taels, a decrease of eleven taels compared to the previous Saturday. On this day, there was a fluctuation of 30.05 taels, making it an extremely turbulent day. The following day, large bars increased by another 3.125, the American silver market was closed, and the shilling rose by one and a half grades. However, internal sentiment was weak despite appearances of strength, with different firms having differing opinions. All firms had sales, while the gold price initially opened with a rise of 6.5 taels, reaching 755 taels, due to rumors that a certain bank was establishing a branch in London and would transport cash there as capital, which boosted confidence. Subsequently, the exchange rate eased, and large players engaged in selling, causing a sharp fall of twenty taels, reaching 34.5 taels. At this point, the British Gold Bank surprisingly quoted a rate of one shilling and three pence. The market then stabilized, reaching 59 taels in the afternoon, with the market closing at 57.5 taels, a recovery of nine taels compared to the previous day. The day's fluctuation was 24.5 taels. On Wednesday, large bars continued to decline by 0.0625, the silver price decreased by 0.25, and the British gold rate initially remained unchanged before being reduced by 1.25 grades. The domestic market also tightened, causing the gold price to open at 59 taels, slightly increasing by 1.5 taels. Due to selling activities, the price fell to 52 taels. There were also rumors of a certain bank absorbing cash, and the shilling suddenly increased by half a grade, reaching 67.5 taels at noon. In the afternoon, the price exceeded 70 taels, reaching 71.5 taels, closing at 68.8 taels, an increase of 11.3 taels compared to the previous day. The day's fluctuation was 19.5 taels. The market continued to show resilience the following day. Large bars continued to fall by 3.125, the silver market decreased by half a fen, and the shilling was reduced by one and a half grades. The domestic market also tightened, causing the gold price to open with an increase of 4.7 taels, reaching 773.5 taels. Subsequently, buying interest surged, suddenly breaking through the 80 tael mark. However, there were ups and downs, with a difference of 15.5 taels from morning to noon. The market initially rose to 790 taels in the early afternoon due to lingering momentum from the noon close. Later, due to the lack of progress on the cash export issue, confidence weakened, causing a sharp decline of over ten taels, reaching 73.3 taels after 4 PM, with the market closing at 76 taels, a further increase of 7.2 taels compared to the previous day. In three days, the price rose by a total of 27.5 taels, with a fluctuation of 21 taels. In general, confidence was unstable, subject to the influence of rumors. On Friday, large bars increased by 0.0625 to 0.125, the silver price increased by 0.25, and the shilling rose by half a grade. The domestic market also eased, causing the gold price to initially decrease by 7.5 taels, reaching 68.5 taels. Subsequently, the market gradually progressed, reaching 81 taels by the noon session. News of a work stoppage at a Mexican silver mine caused a reversal in the market. The afternoon opened at 76 taels, followed by 5 taels. The Indian exchange rate was slightly lower, leading to an increase to 78.5 taels. The market quickly rose again, with numerous sellers, causing the price to break through the 70 tael mark. Some buyers entered the market at the close, pulling the price up by over six taels, reaching 76 taels, the same as the previous day. The day's fluctuation was 15.2 taels. Towards the weekend, large bars increased by another 0.0625, the silver price increased by 0.125, and the shilling rose by half a grade. The domestic market slightly recovered, but ultimately appeared to ease, with the gold price hovering between 70 taels inside and outside the mark. The market opened at 74.5 taels, decreasing by 1.5 taels. Subsequently, there were still numerous sellers, causing the price to fall to 66.3 taels. Later, there were ups and downs, followed by news from abroad that the US Congress was allocating funds for European war veterans to aid the unemployed, which caused the silver price to fall further. As a result, confidence was boosted, and the price exceeded 70 taels, reaching 73.5 taels. At noon, the shilling exchange rate eased, and various firms were overly eager to sell, leading to a sudden drop of ten taels, with the market closing at 60 plus taels, a decrease of 9.5 taels compared to the previous day. The price subsequently decreased by another three or four taels, reaching 62.5 taels. The day's difference was 9.3 taels. The high and low prices of the British, American, Indian markets, exchange rates, and gold prices are detailed below.</p>

<h3>Securities: Bond Prices Rose Sharply Last Week</h3>
<p>▲The Market Also Became More Active, with Transactions Exceeding 37 Million</p>
<p>Although last week was around the end of the month and the settlement period, with only two trading days in February at the beginning of the week, and the market only opening on Thursday for April, and closing on Friday to handle the February futures settlement, and with only two market sessions in the morning from Monday to Thursday, and only resuming full-day trading on the weekend, the market was quite good. Traders were unusually active, and bond prices became increasingly firm, resulting in increased participation. Total bond transactions for the week amounted to 37,730,000 yuan. Spot bonds were opened in many cases, but transactions were only sporadic, with a total of only 125,400 yuan traded for the week. As for the changes in bond prices, the bond market environment was very good, the financial situation was relaxed, and there was strong interest in investing in government bonds. As a result, compared to the previous week, the entire six-year and seven-year troop reduction bonds rose by more than two yuan. The customs reorganization bonds from 19 and the 20-year cigarette bonds also rose by about one and a half yuan each.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Trended Lower Last Week</h3>
<p>▲Wide Range of Fluctuations</p>
<p>The yarn market experienced a very wide range of rises and falls during this week, which was rare. The rapid changes caused confusion, and the situation in the market was chaotic, with anxiety among traders. As a result, market fluctuations were difficult to stabilize, completely impacted by gold price volatility. Any changes in sentiment led to greater fluctuations, as the market was already at a high point. However, actual sales in the market were increasingly sluggish, with no excitement on all sides. Due to the high prices, most people remained on the sidelines. A portion of people were pessimistic about the situation, and various factories still had thick inventories. However, it was still the spring selling season, and there was still hope for future development. Therefore, a certain industrialist had firm confidence, with high expectations. Raw cotton was difficult to loosen, and there was no active downturn in the yarn market. As for European commerce, it showed some improvement, but exchange rates could not improve, resulting in an unusually complex situation in the yarn market. In short, spot goods were most critical. There were three major changes during this week. On Monday, the gold price fell slightly, and there was news that the silver price was being maintained. In the afternoon, it plummeted by a massive five or six taels. On Wednesday, as it was the last day of the month, a major manufacturer made an effort to purchase goods, causing prices to soar by five or six taels in a single day. On Friday, the futures market was closed for settlement. When trading resumed on the weekend, Indian cotton had fallen for two consecutive days, spot yarn sales were weak, the gold market was slightly flat, and exchange rates were easing. Japanese firms sold labeled cotton. There were relatively few buyers in the market, as the price of labeled yarn was around 180 taels, which was a high level and prone to instability, making it susceptible to reversals, so the downturn became more severe. Various dips of more than 4 taels. However, considering cotton prices, factories could not profit. The prices of various labeled yarn months were lower than the previous week by more than four taels in April. Total transactions for the week were 139,600 bales. Merchant spot yarn purchases for the entire week totaled only 2,810 bales, with Japanese yarn accounting for two-thirds. Sales of domestic yarn were very sluggish, with prices down three or four taels compared to the previous week. The amount of bales purchased by various merchants is recorded below.</p>
<p>Merchant | Bales | Merchant | Bales | Xuzhou | 120</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---|---</p>

<h3>Major Changes in Cotton Market Last Week</h3>
<p>The cotton market experienced major changes in the past week. The situation in the business world was extremely tense, much like the terror of the cotton famine. Many people were extremely optimistic, and Japanese merchants broadcasted rumors everywhere. Many people echoed, but the actual inventories were indeed thin. There was little old cotton from all sources, and factories faced the risk of running out of pre-ordered cotton. It was difficult to import Indian cotton due to exchange rate problems. Thus, speculative purchases became feverish, and the market became higher and higher. According to some, the needs of various factories for the next two or three months could be fully met. If the supply of foreign cotton did not ease, difficulties would inevitably arise. The situation in the American cotton market was still stable, but the situation in the Indian cotton market was stronger than that of the American cotton market. This was entirely due to the release of Gandhi and his good talks with the Indian Governor. European commerce also improved, which caused the price of Indian cotton to rise. At the beginning of the week, the marked cotton market fell due to the loosening of the gold market and the fall of Indian cotton by six or seven rupees, falling by one or two taels. On Wednesday, the spot cotton trade was smooth, the yarn market rose again, and the gold price rose. On the fifteenth, due to the monthly settlement market, the futures market traded. On the weekend, Indian cotton fell for two consecutive days, exchange rates eased, and the yarn market tended to fall. Japanese merchants at the Dongmian Foreign Company closed out a large number of long positions, about one or two million, with each falling by more than one tael. As a result, the prices of each marked cotton fell by one tael to seven or eight qian compared with last week. Total transactions for the week totaled 346,600 dan. By origin, Yao cotton totaled 3,300 dan, and various factories imported about 3,000 pieces. The price of American cotton rose by 20 pounds per ton compared with last week. Indian cotton fell by another five rupees over the weekend. The amount purchased by various factories is recorded below.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Rises Again Due to Rain Damage</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, but then strengthened due to excessive rainfall and buying by peers. Futures rose by six to eight pounds, and spot prices rose by five pounds. British cotton futures fell by three or four points, and spot prices fell by sixteen points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by fifty points. Indian cotton was bought by Japanese merchants and sold by brokers and speculators. Pingguoer fell by five rupees for both near and far terms, Aomula fell by five rupees, the far term fell by six rupees, and Bairuoxi fell by six rupees for both near and far terms. The original telegram records are left. (Telegram of the 28th)</p>

Although there were some transactions, the market was flat and weak. Transactions in the number market were even quieter. The price of domestic Taiyuan rock sugar opened yesterday for several dozen boxes at several taels, an increase of 2 qian compared with the previous market, but demand was not strong, and the market was flat and unremarkable.</p>

<h3>The World, People, and Land of Southern Fujian Spring Moss</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence</p>
<p>(1) What is Xiamen?</p>
<p>Xiamen is not just some kind of "gate."</p>
<p>This statement seems even more necessary than the statement that "Shanghai really is like a sea." Xiamen is an island, I only realized this after coming here.</p>
<p>Previously, I knew two things about Xiamen: first, the old boss who started the Chen Jiageng rubber shoe company privately founded Xiamen University; second, Xiamen's streets were notoriously filthy, said to be the worst in the world. Now that I'm here, I know that there is much more to both of these things, and that there are many, many other values that no one has mentioned.</p>
<p>This island is blessed with a good location. First, it's in a warm climate. People in Shanghai and Beijing shiver in two or three layers of padded and fur coats, while people in Xiamen, to say something patriotic, wear a single silk shirt, just to promote domestic goods and support the silk industry. If they didn't want to uphold the etiquette of China's 5,000-year-old civilization, they could go bare-chested in Xiamen without having to spend a lot of money on aspirin. Now that I've said something patriotic, I'll talk about fashion. In Xiamen, a major trading port and the throat of Southern Fujian, the stylish people naturally all wear Western suits. They wear American-style snow-white collared shirts, looking like they're all about to go to the tennis court.</p>
<p>Although a padded jacket is needed when the sea breeze blows, everything looks like the osmanthus season in Jiangnan. The osmanthus flowers are all over the trees, needless to say. The umbrella-shaped banyan trees are lush green and shady. There are also longan and lychee trees, in clumps here and there, preparing to release their flower balls. Most adorable are the peach and plum blossoms blooming at the same time on the branches, peeking out in front of every house. Although it is a rocky island piled with rocks, it is adorned to keep the spring scenery forever.</p>
<p>Xiamen is separated from Gulangyu by only a strait. Gulangyu is still a concession, so its foreign fashion can compete with Shanghai. From Xiamen, it's an hour by small motorboat, or 40 minutes by car, and then a ferry across the strait to Jimei. This is a peninsula extending from the mainland, the hometown of Mr. Chen Jiageng. The Jimei Schools he founded are located there. From Jimei, a car to the southwest leads to Quanzhou. From Xiamen, a ferry to the northwest leads to Zhangzhou. Xiamen is the transportation center of Southern Fujian. There are also large and small merchant ships that connect directly with major ports such as Shanghai, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Taiwan, Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The tide in Xiamen rises and falls as much as twenty-six feet. Although it doesn't have the magnificent view of the Zhejiang tide, and there are almost no waves, just a dark rise and fall, the large difference in height is the greatest in the world. The fish in this harbor are very abundant.</p>
<p>As for the qualification of being the dirtiest place in the world, it's largely disappearing. Originally, building a city on an island naturally meant ups and downs, twists and turns, without any straight roads. Now there is a long, wide Zhongshan Road, very much imitating the scale of large cities on the plains, leveling the high spots. So the two sides of the road have become two rows of yellow earth profiles. The original intersecting streets are perched high on these two yellow earth hills. To get around, you have to walk down the stairs at the end of the street, cross Zhongshan Road, and climb up the stairs on the opposite side to the other side. Now, looking at these small paths, which are almost impossible for two people to walk side by side, also has a different meaning.</p>
<p>The entire island of Xiamen is administratively Siming County. "Xiamen" is just a customary name. Recently, the Siming County Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the 指委會, stating, "Xiamen is the hub of various counties in Southern Fujian, counterbalancing the Nanyang Islands, and is the general meeting place of Southern Fujian commerce. The establishment of the Chamber of Commerce is of utmost importance. This time, the Nanyang commercial industry, grocery industry, flour industry, marine products industry, sugar and oil industry, silk and cloth industry, match industry, Western medicine industry, and money shop industry trade associations, in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law and the procedures for establishing people's organizations, initiated the organization of the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce and changed its name to Siming County Chamber of Commerce. After careful consideration and prudent discussion by the initiating groups, it was unanimously agreed that the name Xiamen has a long history. People at home and abroad mostly know Xiamen but do not know Siming. The preparatory committee should submit a request to the Siming County Party Affairs Guidance Committee... to approve the renaming of the Siming County Chamber of Commerce to the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>Banditry in Southern Fujian is frequently heard of. Newspapers also carry daily news of bandit suppression and how many people have been kidnapped by bandits. As for the western Fujian area, which borders Jiangxi, it has suffered deeply from the Communist Party. According to correspondence from a Southern Fujian press reporter accompanying the army, households in the counties of western Fujian are forced to pay in silver dollars, which are exchanged for agricultural and industrial bank notes that can never be redeemed.</p>
<p>Recently, many Chinese merchants in Nanyang have been operating unsuccessfully, so many want to return to China to do business. However, because returnees are frequently kidnapped, they dare not come back. Otherwise, the Xiamen market would be even more prosperous.</p>
<p>However, the entire island of Xiamen and the towns of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou are safe to live in. I would like to take this opportunity to praise the land, people, and sky of Southern Fujian in this correspondence.</p>
<p>(2) Forbidden Day</p>
<p>The Xiamen newspapers published a news item stating that a joint meeting of the Party, government, and police was held, which resolved the following: A. Order the Chamber of Commerce Preparatory Committee to inform all trade associations and shops that they must not close for business before and after the abolished lunar New Year. B. Order the various bao autonomy joint associations to instruct their sub-associations to inform all households not to celebrate the abolished lunar New Year. C. Inform all institutions, organizations, and schools that they should conduct office work and classes as usual on the abolished lunar New Year and should not take holidays. D. If anyone violates the above measures, they should be reported separately to the higher authorities for punishment, or detained and sent to the Public Security Bureau for strict handling, and three inspection teams will be organized to inspect various routes. There are many other articles, which cannot be fully recorded.</p>
<p>However, before this forbidden day arrived, people were busy preparing, pasting newly written red paper couplets on their doors: "The Emperor's virtue is as great as heaven and earth, the Imperial grace is as deep as rain and dew." Even the poor and dilapidated huts have red paper horizontal strips that say, "Read the Books of the Ancients," and the couplet on the sides says, "Auspicious sun shines on the orchid fragrance of the 甲第, the spring breeze stirs the family reputation of the 棠棣." It is truly a home full of books. Mr. Lin Yutang said, "Even if their psychology, logic, economics, and politics are all failing, they are still worthy of being called a scholar."</p>
<p>In recent days, inspection teams have been tearing down spring couplets sold on the streets, but the result is still that the streets are covered in red. Xiamen is worthy of being Mr. Lin's hometown, loving books more than life. However, New Year's can be banned, but eating meat and wearing new clothes cannot be banned. On this forbidden day, people filled the streets wearing new clothes, and on New Year's Day according to the national calendar, shops were strictly ordered to close, and police teams were sent to investigate. They found a small shoemaker in front of his shop, and he replied, "I only have this half of a shop. If I close the shop, there won't be any light." Today, this small shoemaker's door is also blocked by a large lock, and everyone has locked their doors and gone out to play. The inspection teams can only dutifully inspect.</p>
<p>The firecrackers of Fujian are famous. A few nights ago, I heard several sounds, which I thought were gunshots to demonstrate against thieves, and I was very surprised, because these firecrackers are all single shots, and local families usually keep guns for self-defense, and sometimes fire them to demonstrate. Lately, I have heard these gunshots day and night, so I don't pay attention to them.</p>
<p>As long as this day passes, all phenomena can gradually disappear. However, the joint meeting of the Party, government, and police still calls February 17th New Year's Day, even though it is prefixed with the word "abolished," it still inevitably gives people something to talk about. It can be seen how difficult it is to change customs. Therefore, this day is called Forbidden Day.</p>

<p>Youth Corner</p>
<h3>The People's Night School British</h3>
<p>Running out of the school gate to take a walk in the fields, I inadvertently saw a large group of people gathered around looking at a notice. The only vacancy was snatched by a rickshaw puller. I saw that his eyes were not paying attention to the notice pasted on the wall, as if he was studying the bald head in front of him that had taken away his sight. Finally, he seemed to have seen enough, and he chuckled and retreated.</p>
<p>"Mom..." The rickshaw puller said, wiping the sweat from his face with a piece of blue cloth, staring blankly at the bald head with one eye. I took the opportunity to fill the vacant spot for him. I watched silently.</p>
<p>"We believe that the foundation of a nation is education. When education is universal, the people's wisdom will naturally open... For several years, we have been raising funds and assigning teachers, hoping for great things..."</p>
<p>I felt a light in front of me. The bald head had already murmured and retreated. Although I had not finished reading it, I already understood. Undoubtedly, this must be the student union's public night school enrollment notice.</p>
<p>Indeed, studying in China has now almost become the privilege of the middle and upper classes. Who among the poor families has the strength to cultivate educated children? As a result of years of internal strife, the word "poor" is much more common than education in China, which is really heartbreaking. There are few schools that offer work-study programs in the country. As for night schools, they exist in cities, but only urban people can enjoy them. Moreover, the expensive fees are not something that poor parents can afford for their children.</p>
<p>There are many poor people near our school. To put it bluntly, there are many illiterate people, many people with no knowledge. It is very urgent and important to run a people's night school and instill knowledge and learning into them.</p>
<p>The People's Night School has been established for several years. One night last year, I went to see their class. There were probably more than a hundred people, divided into three classes. The ages of the students were surprisingly uneven. Roughly speaking, it is very common for students from five or six years old to twenty-five or six years old to attend class in the same classroom.</p>
<p>All the expenses are paid for by the student association. Tuition is not charged. The teachers are several enthusiastic classmates of ours. During the day they are students themselves, and at night they teach in the classroom where they originally took classes. It's a very interesting thing.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>One day, Mr. Xi, who served in the People's Night School, said to me with a smile, "We're having an algebra exam tomorrow. You need to prepare. Please take my class for an hour tonight."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I get a red face when I get on stage, it's not a business thing." I hurriedly declined.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, it just smells a little."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>
<p>"They're too smelly. They probably only take three baths in their lives."</p>
<p>"Three times? You're exaggerating."</p>
<p>"How is it not? Once when they're born, once the night before they get married, and once when they're washed for burial. That's three times."</p>
<p>I also joked, "Teacher, hurry up and go to class. The baptism of education is really more important than anything else. If the teacher wants someone to take their place, shouldn't the students be allowed to have someone take their place to listen?"</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>Xi is a person who is good at making noise among his classmates, but once he gets on the podium and becomes a teacher, he changes into a different person.</p>
<p>"No noise allowed!" He often issued this threatening and commanding sound to the students in the audience. His spirit of teaching is not as withered as when he was a student himself. The pictures in the books often seem to run out of the book when he describes them.</p>
<p>I admire him, but I finally realized the contradiction of every move in life.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>The People's Night School ends four weeks before the end of the semester. The results are very satisfying.</p>
<p>Education in China is too widespread. There are too many poor young people in China. They are really too unfortunate. This kind of rescue method is of course very effective. I hope everyone will imitate it and do it.</p>
<p>Young people, work hard! The light is ahead, waiting for us!</p>
<h3>Morning Assembly Jiang Shanqing</h3>
<p>Every day at 8:30, all the students have to hold a morning assembly in the auditorium. The morning assembly is an opportunity to report important matters, connect teachers and students, enhance students' friendship, and stimulate diligent study. Every day, the class teacher or the head teacher takes turns presiding. Today it was Mr. Kong's turn.</p>
<p>He first explained the meaning of the morning assembly, and then reported to us on the central training methods of moral education, which is to implement the articles on "How to Be a Model Student." The so-called articles on how to be a model student are a concrete method of central training. Each week, a key goal is proposed. For example, order is the most difficult thing to rectify at the beginning of the school year, so this week is Order Week, taking "order" as the center of this week's training. At the same time, many items about order are printed and compiled into concise articles, which should be carefully observed and followed at all times. If there is a violation, the classmates will report it, and a "?" symbol will be written on the index card in the classroom, according to the violated article, in the "Name" column of the person. On the one hand, it can prompt the violator to be vigilant, and on the other hand, it can count the behavior of the students and make comparisons between each grade.</p>
<p>I think these articles are very beneficial to us, my friend, so I am now copying them for you, so that you and I can cultivate ourselves at the same time and be model students.</p>
<p>Mr. Kong then carefully explained the articles of this Order Week:</p>
<p>1. I bring all the things I need to school every day.</p>
<p>2. I walk on the left.</p>
<p>3. I look left and right before crossing the road.</p>
<p>4. I line up quietly, neatly, and quickly.</p>
<p>5. I am quiet when I talk and laugh, and do not hinder others from doing things.</p>
<p>6. I don't play with other things or do other things in class.</p>
<p>7. I raise my hand before speaking in class.</p>
<p>8. I place all kinds of utensils in a fixed position.</p>
<p>9. I maintain order even when the teacher is not present.</p>
<p>10. I put the desks and chairs in place when I leave my seat.</p>
<p>11. I arrive at school, go home, go to appointments, and attend meetings on time.</p>
<p>Submit homework.</p>
<p>12. I don't eat things along the way.</p>
<p>13. I walk quickly and lightly when entering and leaving the classroom, and I don't rush ahead.</p>
<p>14. I open and close the door gently.</p>
<p>15. I immediately follow all kinds of signals.</p>
<p>16. I don't monopolize public play equipment.</p>
<p>17. I don't rush to use public equipment, and I return it to its original place after use.</p>
<p>18. I don't pass through places where passage is prohibited.</p>
<p>19. I abide by the rules of the meeting place and obey the opinions of the majority when I attend a meeting.</p>
<p>20. I don't deliberately squeeze people when there are many people.</p>
<p>21. I do my best to maintain order in the whole school.</p>
<p>22. I maintain order even when my teachers and parents are not present.</p>
<p>23. I do not interrupt people's conversations unless there is an urgent reason.</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<p>Manchuria and Mongolia Under Japanese Aggression Nan Xin</p>
<p>By Shi Ming</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Japan has been invading our country for more than thirty years, but its focus has been especially on Manchuria, Mongolia, and Shandong. Manchuria and Mongolia, because of their geographical and historical relations, have suffered even more severely. From the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 to the present, Japan has used all its ambitions to invade Manchuria and Mongolia. Even the northeast half of the country is almost entirely in the hands of the Japanese. Not long ago, there was the so-called New Manchuria-Mongolia Policy, which actively decided to further invade Manchuria and Mongolia. Its unique ambition is the same as its attempt to destroy the territory of Korea. After that, the Jinan Incident occurred, and the people of the country were extremely angry and indignant at the Japanese. However, most of the people in the country are probably still unable to fully understand the actual situation of Japan's invasion of our country. At the same time, there are not many monographs of this kind in the market, because there are few people in the country who are dedicated to studying these issues. Foreigners' invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia is carried out secretly with their ambitions. It is not a violent battle to plunder, so it is not easy to arouse the extra attention of the people of the country. In order to get a glimpse of the entire inside story of the Japanese invasion, a book called "Manchuria and Mongolia Under Japanese Aggression" was published on the market not long ago. Its content is quite detailed, not only describing the history and current situation of Japan's invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia in detail, but also systematically explaining all the important issues related to Manchuria and Mongolia. The author, Mr. Shi, said in the preface that the purpose of writing this book is to arouse the extra attention of the people of the country, in order to seek the good fortune of "returning our mountains and rivers," and at the same time, it is for the reference of those who are concerned about the Manchuria-Mongolia issue and the ambitions of Japanese imperialism.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into nine chapters, exposing the Japanese ambition to invade Manchuria and Mongolia without reservation. It is really worth reading. (1) The status of Manchuria and Mongolia and its relationship with Japan; (2) The history of Japan's invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia; (3) Japan's political and military power in Manchuria and Mongolia; (4) Japan's economic invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia I (railway invasion and the South Manchuria Railway Company); (5) Japan's economic invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia II (mineral, industrial, commercial, agricultural, forestry, forest, air rights, postal and telecommunications, fishing, etc. invasion); (6) Japan's cultural invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia; (7) Japan's colonial policy in Manchuria and Mongolia; (8) Japan's recent conspiracy and facts of invading Manchuria and Mongolia; (9) Conclusion. Now, its content is briefly described.</p>
<p>If we want to understand the entire root of Japan's invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia, we must examine it from both geographical and historical aspects. The author, Mr. Shi, also noticed this point, so at the beginning of the book, he described the status of Manchuria and Mongolia and its important relationship with Japan, which we also need to know urgently, because if we have a clear outline of the scope, status, and importance of Manchuria and Mongolia, then all other truths about Manchuria and Mongolia will be easy to understand. The so-called "Man" refers to Manchuria, which includes the three provinces of Fengtian, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. The Japanese divide it into South Manchuria and North Manchuria. The area is wider than the total area of the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui. Mongolia was originally divided into Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia, but the Japanese have the names East Mongolia and West Mongolia because of their aggressive purposes. The area of Manchuria and Mongolia is wide, and there is also a lot of arable land, which is truly a great source of wealth. According to the Japanese's accurate investigation, in addition to abundant agricultural products, there is also a large amount of livestock production. This is truly a treasure of the country's resources. In terms of production, the book contains a detailed table for our reference. From this point of view, it is so painful that Manchuria and Mongolia are now in the hands of the Japanese and the equally ambitious Russian imperialists, which is no different from the Japanese plundering our country's only wealth.</p>
<p>In terms of topography, Manchuria is located in the Heilongjiang River Basin, which is one of China's four major river basins, so the water conservancy is very good, and transportation and irrigation are suitable. The abundance of Manchuria's production can also be said to be the heaven-born source of wealth. It can be seen from this that there is still undeveloped land. If it is fully reclaimed, the prospects for its harvest will be limitless. Then, it is inevitable that it will cause the Japanese imperialists to covet it. (1) Geographical adjacency. Manchuria is connected to Korea and faces Japan across the Sea of Japan. Because of the geographical relationship, it is easy for the Japanese to extend its power. (2) The biggest panic for Japan is the two major problems: the rapid increase in population and the lack of food in Japan. Therefore, people in the country are anxious and clamoring about this. (3) The lack of industrial raw materials, because Japan's territory is small and its production is weak. The lack of iron, coal, oil, cotton, wool, etc. all depends on the supply of other countries. It can be incorporated into the Japanese economic circle, which can make up for its shortcomings. Not only can the problem of raw materials be perfectly solved, but also the relationship between Japanese goods' sales market and Manchuria and Mongolia is great. (4) National defense issues. Manchuria and Mongolia are located between China, Russia, and Japan, and international relations are very complicated. Therefore, this place not only makes Japan covet it, but also allows Russia, the so-called communist country, to greatly extend its aggressive ambitions. These four points are the main reasons for Japan's invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia. Those of us who pay attention to the Manchuria-Mongolia issue must first understand the main reasons for its invasion. Regarding this, the author said in the book in great detail, which is enough to help scholars who study geography.</p>
<p>Secondly, what we urgently need to understand is the history of Japan's invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia. Of course, other historical monographs also contain records of this, but there is often a defect that they cannot be detailed. In this book, the author separately mentions the invasive treaties signed between Japan and our country, so that we can understand them at a glance, such as the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the return of Liaodong, the Sino-Russian Secret Treaty, Russia's rampant invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia, the Russo-Japanese War, the Treaty of Portsmouth, the Sino-Japanese Manchuria Post-War Treaty, the establishment of the South Manchuria Railway Company and the Governor's Office, the Yalu River Forest Issue and the resolution of the Five Suspended Cases, the American proposal for the neutrality of the Manchuria Railway and the Russo-Japanese alliance, the five Manchuria-Mongolia railway rights, the Twenty-One Demands concerning Manchuria and Mongolia, the Zhengjiatun Incident, the investment in Manchuria and Mongolia during the Duan Qirui administration, the harm of the Sino-Japanese military agreement, the request to exclude Manchuria and Mongolia, the failure to return Lushun and Dalian, and Japan's aggressive ambitions, etc. are all described in stages. (1) The period when Japan began to invade Manchuria; (2) The period when Russia invaded Manchuria and Mongolia; (3) The period when Japan acquired superior economic and political rights in Manchuria; (4) The period when Japan implemented the invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia; (5) The period when Japan invaded Manchuria and Mongolia arbitrarily; (6) The period when Japan recently attempted to invade Manchuria and Mongolia. If we look at the above six points, we can know that the period when Japan actually occupied Manchuria is not far from now. What do people in our country think about this?</p>
<p>In fact, the northeastern and southwestern frontier areas of our country are no longer owned by our country. Tibet belongs to the British, Outer Mongolia is independent under the jurisdiction of Russia, and Manchuria and Inner Mongolia are under the control of the Japanese. We only need to look at the political tools of Japan's invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia, the political superior rights in the treaty, the four-headed politics, and the four key points of the organization and distribution of the Japanese army in Manchuria, and we can understand a glimpse of its inside story in Manchuria and Mongolia. Japan's economic invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia, its railway policy, such as directly built railways, indirectly invested railways, the infringement of national rights by the South Manchuria Railway, the East India Company's South Manchuria Railway Company, the centralism of the South Manchuria Railway, and other aspects of industry, there are mineral industries solely operated by the Japanese and invested by the Japanese, coal and iron as the bread of imperialism, the East Asia Development Company, the loss of exclusive rights to Chinese industries, companies solely operated by the Japanese, Sino-Japanese joint ventures, the status of Japanese companies in various places, Yokohama Specie Bank, agricultural institutions, forest companies, Japan's tussah silk industry, the origin and status of the loss of air rights, submarine cables and radio, the monopoly of postal and telecommunications, and the loss of fishing profits, etc. All of these are Japan's entire economic plan to invade Manchuria and Mongolia. When we read what is described in the book, we are really terrified, because these economic lifelines related to the life of the country are all controlled in the hands of the Japanese, and it will be difficult for our country's inherent strength to extend in the future. This is extremely important for the future of national strength. The book lists detailed tables of various revenues of Japanese-run businesses, etc., so that readers can understand them at a glance. The loss of China's financial resources is really no greater than this.</p>
<p>Of course, the Japanese conspiracy against Manchuria and Mongolia does not stop there, but in this book, the major ones are described in detail. It relies on unequal treaties as a talisman and a basis in order to blatantly plot against our country. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that unequal treaties are the Chinese people's contracts of indentured servitude, which is a warning to awaken the people of the country. This book is really worth reading for those who are concerned about the Manchuria-Mongolia issue. Moreover, what the author discusses is all correct, and at the same time, it is based on facts. It is a very good history book.</p>
