<h3>緊急之民食問題（四）</h3>
<p>昨評未盡。今請續言。</p>
<p>五曰維持農民經濟也。今日農民經濟之凋敝。已達極巓。佃租高壓。錢糧預徵。農村經濟。已瀕破。産農民生且不能。更何能改良農業。增進生産。今後於此積弊。應痛加整頓。以蘇農困。予農業以改良之機。六曰預防天災也。風雹水旱。種種自然界之變異。都可以人工應用科學。預爲防衛。如造林可以障風沙。可以畜水量。以備旱潦。浚導河流。講求水利。亦可以資旱年之救濟。免雨水之成災。凡此預防之方。政府應切實講求。早爲籌辦。庶災禍永除。民生日裕。七曰提倡囤積也。我國備荒舊政。本有義倉之囤積方法。大抵秋收以後。農民輒傾其所穫。賤價賣出。以還急債。（十三日專電）至春夏之交。靑黄不接。食糧緊迫。向之賤價糶出者。茲乃無法生存。如提倡囤積。於其賤糶時。則廣爲收容。於其需急時。則平價糶出。更有嬴餘。則儲以備荒。庶豐歲可以温飽。凶年得免於死亡。八曰禁種烟苗也。鴉片嗜好。普遍全國。大利所有。農乃樂種。尤多强種。全國川湘雲貴豫秦甘閩桂粤等區。無不種植。即以熱河一處。播種土地達百餘萬畝。徵稅年達千萬以上地遍毒草。民淪黑籍。其直接間接影響於農業生産者。蓋無可勝計。長此不禁。豈惟民食日蹙。行且滅我國家。亡我種族。九曰實行裁軍也。古者寓兵於農。兵足而農事亦不廢。今日我國兵額。據十九年九月統計。共有二·五九九·二○○人。實則其他雜牌軍隊。尙不在内也。警察團防。尙不在内也。官署胥役。尙不在内也假使綜合統計。則其爲數之鉅。當可開古往今來之世界新紀錄。如此巨額之人數。旣不生産。徒坐以銷費。甚且擾害農民。妨害農作。再不實行裁撤返農。必至有田而無人耕種。十曰移民墾荒也。我國東北西北。荒地尙多。據東北年鑑統計東北一隅。荒地共有二○七·一○六·一五七畝。丨丨擁有如此廣大之處女地。而不移民開發。坐使内苦人口之擁擠。外啓强鄰之覬覦。寗非大愚。據南開大學社會經濟調查委員會統計。民國十七年東北移民入境者僅一·○八九○○○人。去而離境者五七八·○○○人。十八年入境者一·○四六·二九一人出境者六二一·八九七人。但移殖而無組織。移去者每每生活無方。終多返回故地。故今後宜設立移民局。專司此政。統籌全局。精密計劃。使去者皆安其生。樂其業。以開發富源。增加農産。</p>
<p>凡此十者。皆治本之要圖。亦即挽救我國計民生之大道。苟能實行。則外以抗侵凌。内以致强富。固何求而不能得。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者。我國以農立國。目前雖農業經濟。瀕於破産。但工業經濟。仍未建立。帝國主義者挾其雄厚之工業經濟以來侵。其賴以砥柱中流撑持危局者。則仍爲其辛勤終歲不得温飽之農民也。上述治標治本之方。固所以拯人民於死亡。然又何莫非拯我國家於破産。於此存亡緊急關頭。倘再不以最大之决心。爲人民解倒懸。爲國家紆困厄。則此以農立國之國家。其前途危險。又豈僅民食問題而已哉。</p>

<h3>英閣經濟委員會</h3>
<h3>討論平衡預算</h3>
<p>意見未能一致</p>
<p>保守黨魁趕回倫敦</p>
<p>準備參加三黨會議</p>
<p>路透十三日倫敦電　平衡預算之必要、仍爲公共討論之點、昨日内閣經濟委員會集議三小時、未有公報發出、投資家乃以私人辯論進行其經濟之研究、下屆預算案確已由當局勉强平衡之、其平衡方法、爲嚴削社會與國防經費、但社會黨大聲疾呼「加稅而不可减政」、又有人主張發行國家有奬債券、每年或每半年抽籤領奬、以爲此舉較債券調換計劃更爲有利、至於債劵調換計劃、聞内閣意見不盡相同、而擁護政府之激烈份子多公然大唱高調、致發生强迫調換之怪語、雖負責方面哂其無稽、然許多執有債券者因此謠言、已不能安枕無憂、蓋債券昨已受謠言之影響、尤以五釐戰債爲甚、已跌至數年未有之最低度矣、一般意見以爲政府苟無預定的經濟程序、未必能施行自動的調換之計劃、若强制的調換、顯然違反公道、又不僅傷害英國維護契約尊嚴之令名而已也、銀行及保險行允竭力與政府合作者、定將以契約之尊嚴爲政府告、况銀行與保險行持有政府債券約共值五萬萬鎊、其勢力誠不可侮、</p>
<p>路透十二日倫敦電　政府要員五人、即組成内閣經濟委員會者、中止其假期、而集於倫敦、今日開始考慮政府减政程序、午後七時散會、未有切實决定、但明日須再集議、將於下星期中繕具辦法、保守黨領袖包爾温刻在法國、領袖職務暫由尼維爾張伯倫代行、今張伯倫由蘇格蘭怱促趕回倫敦、此事頗爲人重視、因有三黨會議之說也、</p>
<p>路透十三日倫敦電　包爾温今晨突由歐陸回抵倫敦、三黨開會討論經濟現局之舉、因此大有希望、尼維爾張伯倫亦由蘇格蘭回此、兩要員曾討論保守黨應取之態度、歷兩小時之久、内閣經濟委員會自昨日起在首相邸討論預算案平衡辦法、今猶在進行中、喬治之代表薩繆爾連日在自由黨總部、亦甚忙碌、首相麥唐納已於今日返蘇格蘭、繼續休息、</p>
<h3>德法軍縮問題</h3>
<p>德報傳已同意</p>
<p>國民十三日柏林電　今日民主黨機關報捷胡爾夫午報、載一關於德法軍縮同意之重要消息、該報常以獨得秘訊見稱、故極爲德人所注意、據述德法政府間對於軍縮同題、在原則上已告同意、本月底法執政來德答訪時、或可加以核准、春内容兩政府自行保證限制陸海軍費、但允德國自由支配、俾得充實其國防上弱點、第一、組織小規模之航空隊、第二、東境要塞增加重砲、此兩項雖與凡爾賽和約不符、但該報以爲苟法人同意後、他國黨亦不致抗議、至法國則願有此讓步、俾可進行英意法德四國公約、藉以保證明年軍縮大會部份之成功、因照目下情勢、倘德國堅持舊協約國按照和約實踐軍縮保證、則軍縮大會必致失敗、現政界方面縱不信法國能對德如此讓步、但極重視此、訊、且不乏相信趨向、質諸當道則旣不否認、亦不證實、</p>
<h3>古巴亂事緊張</h3>
<p>總統民心己失</p>
<p>國民社十二日哈伐那電　今日革命形勢益張、此間郊外魯雅諾地方、革軍與政府軍正在激戰、死亡未詳、聖泰克勒與庇那台拿等地方亦有大戰、昨日總統下令限革軍於午夜以前自拔來歸後、迄無所著、且反增敵黨之憤慨、今日攻擊政府軍益力、總之、此番革命何時方止、此時尙難預料、</p>
<p>又電　今日政府軍司令稱、庇那台里烏省内政府軍大勝、敵軍全降、</p>
<p>路透社十三日華盛頓電　美政府不欲干涉古巴亂事、官塲意見、亂事尙未達干涉之程度、但據紐約時報哈伐那訪員電稱、全島鼎沸、人民羣起執戈反抗政府、</p>
<p>德當局</p>
<h3>取締過激行動</h3>
<p>共黨機關被搜查</p>
<p>路透十二日柏林電　今夜柏林空氣頗爲緊張、大批警察調入城中、預防昨夜亂事之復作、警察乘裝貨汽車在閙事區域往來巡邏、柏林瑪台堡·吕納堡等處、皆有共産黨槍擊警察事、共傷十二人、拘獲六十人、阿成等處挨戶搜查、發現一秘密機關、名爲紅色襲擊者公會、專對付國家社會黨及警察、被捕者現有五十人、内有共産黨國會議員一人、及市議會議員二、</p>
<h3>印回敎徒衝突</h3>
<p>起因甚微</p>
<p>路透十三日孟買電　台拉伊斯美爾汗地方有回敎徒店主與一印度敎徒顧客、因講價爭執、釀成重大衝突、死三人、傷十七人、焚毁印度敎徒住屋四百間、目下秩序尙未恢復、拉賀爾已派兵前往彈壓、當縱火焚屋之前、曾發生刦案多起、</p>
<p>美農務局</p>
<h3>救濟棉市辦法</h3>
<p>提議毁滅棉産三之一</p>
<p>存貨賒德計劃成泡影</p>
<p>路透社十二日華盛頓電　美國農務局向十四産棉州州長建議、將本年棉産毁滅三分之一、如各州贊成、則美政府可將現所囤積之棉再保持一年、而不出售、此計劃可使美棉總供給至少减少四百萬包、此外尙有三百萬包、本年可不出售於市、如最大産棉州有十州接受此議、則此計劃即須實施、</p>
<p>路透社十三日大阪電　美農務局提議毁滅棉　一部份之報告傳到後、紗花市價漲起四元至五元、</p>
<p>國民社十二日柏林電　美國賒售小麥棉花與德之計劃、今日已認爲將成泡影、因聨邦農業救濟局旣反對德國賒購六十萬包棉花之後、而華盛頓方面對德人之賒購美麥、亦不歡迎、故美總統已命駐德大使薩克德停止接洽、</p>
<h3>西班牙工潮洶湧</h3>
<p>政局呈不穏</p>
<p>國民十二日瑪德里電　近日西班牙國内不靖、變亂迭出、而罷工之事亦疊出不窮、據善於觀察者言、此皆政局不穏之朕兆云、在巴塞洛那境内原有礦工四萬人罷工、今又有橡皮及硬木等廠之工人萬餘加入、罷工人與警察時有衝突發生、他拉剛那地方情形尤爲惡劣、該地失業工人要求救濟、聲勢洶洶、當局無法應付、現失業工人已組織委員會、宣布明日將對於各工廠商戶行總攻擊、現政府方面已派遣重兵開往彈壓、柯爾多巴省中有共産黨及合組派份子百餘人被逮、彼等因圖謀在柯省建立紅色政府、并已運動一切工農組織、同時宣布總罷工、在此種陰謀發覺之前、已有多處工團允予贊助、</p>
<h3>新疆境内有劇震</h3>
<p>路透十三日東京電　帝國大學地震學家宣稱、學校内最新之地震儀表示新疆有地震、其劇烈與數年前甘肅所遭者相同、此次地震、世界各處觀象臺之儀器、咸表示之、據著名地震學家今村推測、其震地在天山北嶺南嶺之間、</p>
<h3>敎廷反對採用新歷</h3>
<p>國民社十三日日内瓦電　敎廷致函國際聨盟秘書處、反對新歷、由敎王署名、不赞成確定復活節日期與每年分爲十三月、謂新歷中有數項與基督敎傳統敎條相鑿枘、渠未見有急遽改歷之理由、但若舉世認爲有改歷必要、國聨大會亦通過改歷案、組織國際專家委員會製定可行方案、則渠亦樂於將全部問題加以考慮、</p>
<h3>澳飛行家抵鹿兒島</h3>
<p>路透十三日東京電　澳飛行家支謙斯德、今晚七時許由滬飛抵鹿兒島、計程五六小時可抵、今延至約十小時、當局現向支氏盤詰、曾否在中途被迫降落、</p>

<h3>萬案肇事地點</h3>
<h3>馬家哨口訪問紀少·一·</h3>
<h3>（一）引言</h3>
<p>萬寳山鮮人種稻案、因朝鮮暴動、已聳動世界之觀聽、殊非吾人始料所及、語曰、「星星之火、可以燎原」、然則鮮人種稻、誠星星之火、而日人則又縱火吹風者也、馴至火光熊熊、勢不可遏、遂犧牲千百全無關係之旅韓僑胞、豈非一九三一年最大不幸事件耶、</p>
<p>萬案雖由鮮人種稻而發生、然起初不過中鮮農民間之經濟的糾紛、所以擴大成今日嚴重之局面者、實由於馬家哨口之役、故馬家哨口稱爲萬案肇事地點也可、稱爲一九三一年最大不幸事件之導源地點、亦無不可、</p>
<p>馬家哨口、乃伊通河之一小渡口也、居民僅二三家、距長春四十五華里、距萬寳山二十五華里、倘無斯役、誰理會之、余居長九年、從未聞及、本年七月中央太學地里考察團來長、將有馬家哨口之行、余得該團之允許、欣然加入、時爲八月一日、距肇事時（七月一二日）正一整月耳、</p>

<h3>日水兵</h3>
<h3>刦架檢查員</h3>
<p>華通碼頭查獲日貨</p>
<p>被日兵在中途奪去</p>
<p>議定以後武力護裝</p>
<p>自反日會派員赴各輪船碼頭檢查日貨以來、偷運日貨、常有查獲、前夜（即十二號）檢查員、又在浦東華通碼頭、查獲大批日本疋頭棉紗、係裝運牛莊者、當被各檢查員、將該貨全數扣留、詎日人竟命日水兵、用武力截奪、並將檢查員四人刦掠而去、沿途受日人之毆辱、現此事巳經我方提出抗議、茲將此事詳情、切實查報如後、</p>
<p>頭次私運查獲　本月四日、滬上日商江商伊籐等、各有大批東洋疋頭棉紗等、共計三百六十件、委托日本運輸業國際會社、代爲報裝到牛莊、因無日輪行駛此路、乃改裝太古公司大名輪、又值大名貨多退關、遂改載德安輪運去、在過駁上船之際、被反日會得知、急派檢查隊到埠查視、該項大批疋紗三百六十件、值銀七萬餘兩、當被扣留、帶往陸家嘴、及經日商得知、欲圖追回、當時該項日貨、已經上棧、此事由日領提向我方交涉、至今尙未解决、而第二次日貨續裝、又被查到、</p>
<p>二次日貨扣留　十二日、本埠東洋棉紗會社、有紗布一百七十一件、值銀三萬三千一百八十五兩、亦係裝赴營口、仍委托國際運輸會社、代爲報裝、係載太古公司臨安輪赴牛莊、此貨由十二日下午七時上駁船、用小火輪拖到浦東華通碼頭、至下午九時許、方始動工、裝入臨安船内、經兩小時之久、已裝去九十餘件、尙餘八十件左右、方在續裝、而反日會之檢查隊員、乘小輪到埠、發見此項日貨後、便令小工停裝、同時命臨安船上收貨員、將已入艙、九十餘件、一併回卸、仍令過上原駁、然後由檢查員、將該貨金部扣留、即用本輪拖　陸家嘴、報告會中核</p>
<p>日商派兵奪貨　今次日商裝轉此貨、東棉轉派根本清太郎·國際特派林田·到碼頭監貨上船、當檢查員扣貨之際、兩日人均不在場、及至十　時以後、此貨已經檢查隊帶走、而日人林田乃到、見此情形、立即趕往日本駐淵海軍處、請求派兵保護、即由日海軍司令、知照停抛浦江之安宅號軍艦、派全武裝日本海軍陸戰隊二十五名、隨同林田至浦東、立乘瑞鳳丸小輪、在後追逐、檢查隊小輪、因拖帶貨駁重儎、行駛較遲、故方抵陸家嘴、正擬進港、日海兵已趕到、即將原貨及駁船奪回、由瑞鳳丸小輪拖去、</p>
<p>日兵刦掠檢查　日水兵追到檢查隊小火輪、便持械躍登輪内、一方奪取貨駁、一方則用槍枝、將稅方在船各檢查員、用武亂毆、我方檢查人員、多係徒手、豈能與全武裝之日水兵抗、而且日兵抱定尋豐而來、逢人即打、檢查員紛紛上陸暫避、當場有宋志文·高善林·王阿金·王美法·等四人不及走脫、被日水兵捉住、拖上日人之瑞鳳丸小輪、架掠而去、上輪以後、日水兵用槍柄、將四人痛打、先押到安宅軍艦、然後再由日水兵、將四人用兵艦小火輪、轉押送日本領事署、</p>
<p>公安局之交涉　此事發生後、反日會已報告市政府當局、至昨日午刻、本市公安局、已派員到日本領事公署、將、被日本水兵行兇刦架被押在領署之檢查員宋高王王四人、交涉領回、聞各該檢查員業於昨午領囘、另行提出交涉、</p>
<p>日商會議裝貨　昨日、本埠各日商、轉往日領事署開會、討論以後日本貨之運輸辦法、討論結果、日人以反日會之檢查貨件、用武力對付、最爲穏妥、各日商引蘇州河日水兵奪囘蔴袋二十件、與此次追還疋紗一百七十餘件之得告成功、以後日貨裝運、决計派武裝海軍保護、下船、如果再有檢查扣貨、准日兵自由行動、聞日領與海軍當局、均皆默允、故昨日、各日商無不志高氣揚、表示不畏反日而於此後運貨將變爲公開的裝載矣、此舉與我方反日前途、頗有關係也、</p>
<p>委員會宣言　全國同胞公鑒、吾國不幸、外侮洊至、日本帝國主義者、旣於萬寶山奪我田畝、佔我土地、戕害我農民、侮辱我官府、復於朝鮮唆使浪人屠我僑胞、旬日之聞、死者千餘人、傷者數千人、損失財産達數萬萬元、而日本帝國主義者、毫無悔禍之心、日本駐滬日艦、疊派武裝海軍、侵入華界、搶掠貨物、逮捕同胞、並將本會職員、毆打成傷、其用心之險狠、行爲之横暴、手叚之卑鄙、實使我人無可再忍茲將經過事實、撮告國人、幸垂鑒焉、本月十一日清晨五時、本會閘北檢查處、據報有奸商購買日本麻袋七千五百只、在蘇州路希圖偷運出境、當由該檢查處派員截留、至八時、有自稱日人者出面干涉、要求發還、該處以無權發還、當即陪同日人至本會請求本會以該貨如係日人所購、查明之後、即可發還、乃即派員會同該日人等前往查騐、以求迅速、不料本會職員方抵碼頭、而該項被扣之麻袋、早被武裝兵强刦而去、據當時目擊者言、是日上午十二時、突來日兵三十餘人、荷槍實彈、如臨大敵、槍口瞄準檢查船、禁嚇看守人員不准開口、同時即由日兵十餘人將麻袋搬入小汽船中、呼嘯叩去、此事發生後之翌日、本會浦東檢查處有奸商購買日紗運往外埠、當即派員在黄浦江中將其扣留、另雇小輪拖回浦東、比及江岸、該處伏有日船一艘、滿載日兵、即將該紗完全搶去、並擄去我檢查員宋志文·高善林、王美法·王阿金·等四人、尙有一人、不知下落、生死不明、當晚二時許、本會據報後、即派幹員馳往公安局請爲交涉、幾經曲拆、始由日本領事署、於十二時、將該被擄之四人送還本會、至失踪之人、則仍杳無消息、生死不明、而放還之四人、或遭皮鞋之踢傷、或受槍柄之毆擊、以致臂腿腰背處、無一不血殷斑斑、傷痕纍纍撫視之下、爲之泫然、本會同人、丁茲國難當頭之際、復受各界付托之重、赴湯蹈火、義無反顧、斷腔折臂、死而無怨、惟念中國爲四萬萬人之中國、救國爲四萬萬人之公事、天下興亡、匹夫有責、本會同人、固應勇往直前、首當其衝、全國各界、亦應振臂奮起、挺身而出、而吾高高在上之黨政機關、平時領導人民、致力於三民主義之革命者、更應同仇敵愾、爲民先鋒、今日本帝國主義者、奪我國地、殺我僑胞、而駐滬日艦、又派大隊日兵、侵入華界、擄人刦貨、此而不爲、孰不可爲、此而可忍、孰不可忍、五分鐘之熱度、固甚可恥、若併此五分鐘熱度而亦無之、其可恥不將更甚乎、嗟乎、不自由毋寗死、今則爭自由死、不爭亦死、四萬方里之錦繡河山、豈尙有吾自甘暴棄之中國人立足之地、國人奈何尙戀此萬國奴隸之夢而不爲時代之前驅哉、上海市各界反日援僑委員會宣言、</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>監獄中的大力士</p>
<p>英國白拉克波爾Blackpool地方。有一人犯罪入獄。判决六個月的監禁。他兩手套着鐐銬。并且反翦在背後。簡直是束縛得無可用力的了。。誰知他竟會毁壞了鐐銬。襲擊巡警。而獄室中的鐵窗。也被他　將下來。搗爲粉碎。這般的神力。可稱撒姆遜Samson第二。</p>
<p>紙板造成的禮拜堂</p>
<p>非洲脫國Transval首鎭約翰士堡Jchnnesburg二十英里外。在皮拿尼Benoni的邊界上。有一座禮拜堂。全用紙板造成。没有一根木材。在二十一年前。由英國逐部運來。在當地蓋搭。歷時雖久。却依然可用。最近由皮拿尼移往别處。大約還有好多年可用哩。</p>

<h3>溽暑話靑城</h3>
<p>— 張炎</p>
<p>即吳佩孚現遊之處</p>
<p>本報七日成都專電。載吳佩孚已抵成都。住昭覺寺。前往灌縣游靑城山云云。不侫曩客成都時。曾蒞靑城一次。該處山水不亞西湖。爰本所知。追紀一二。以餉讀者。</p>
<p>昭覺寺　寺在成都北門外二三里許。爲該縣最著大叢林。僧衆綦夥。廟産富厚。寺址爲椅形。四面古木參天。風景幽美。殿宇巍峨。雕梁畫棟。前清時有田産七千餘畝。爲巡警道周孝懷充公一半。現祇有田産二三千畝。仍爲巨大叢林。因此爲爲名人駐節之地。</p>
<p>灌縣天時特别　灌縣居成都西陲。距省約一百餘里。民風樸厚。出産以藥材羊毛爲大宗。半邊城牆靠山。四時氣候咸宜。最奇者。該縣男婦老幼。雖無諸葛亮搯指推算之能。而竟能知其未來天氣。斷定翌日陰晴風雨。其法於每日下盡。如狂風怒號。則翌日浪靜風平。紅日滿窗。設不刮風。則次日非雨即陰。當地人曾百試不爽。洵奇事也。</p>
<p>靑城山景好　靑城山距灌縣約五十餘里。山有三十六峯。峯峯有景。無冬無夏。氣候適宜。故川人有靑城山景蓋天下之諺。每交夏令。中外人士之前往避暑者。其盛况不亞於莫干廬山也。山石上鐫有天下第一峯五字。字至大。遒勁有力。清成都府尹黄雲鵠所書。山中有上清宫。純陽覯。天師沿諸廟。山景有鴛鴦井。其水清冽而甜。烹茶飲之。雖虎跑泉水亦不及。又有金鞭巖。崖間懸有墨虎玄壇趙公明金鞭一。日出時。與紅日相映。霞光燦爛。刺射眼簾。蔚爲奇觀。其餘佳景紀不勝紀。茲特摘其犖犖大者。略紀一二耳。</p>
<h3>金盤銀琖</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>金盤銀琖。藥名也。顧非尋常藥肆所得而購。偶然獲之。自爲奇珍。一昨聞客談其事。殊新頴可喜。客固蒲圻人也。其地有某士子者。以風流放誕故。終日以醇酒婦人爲樂。卒得痲痹不仁之症。鍼砭無效。跼居一室。不能越雷池一步。心綦憂之。如是者三載。一日。來一蜀僧。鬚顔蒼然。破衲露肘。謂能治痼疾奇病。某知之。以羣醫束手。姑召僧試治之。僧一診察。即出粉末一撮使吞之。并别爲預貯小包六。俾於一來復中服之無缺。七日後。儈不速自來。則某已霍然而愈。起立申謝。即僧以何術而致此。曰此金盤銀琖之国簱老衲不敢居功也。乃爲述金盤銀琖之由來。前歲。行脚來鄂。寄宿某寺。寺近田疇。暮靄斜陽中。牧童牽犢而過。衲素喜聆童豎之天眞話。童豎輩莫不引衲爲可親。一日。有以曾覩一犬遺矢於牛糞上。疊累爲小邱。頗饒奇趣者。衲聞之大喜曰。此固求之數年而不得之良劑也。命童導至其地。覓得而裏之歸。乾曝。磨之成粉。即所謂金盤銀琖者是也。顧不可先使病家知之。知之則必嘔吐不納。藥不達内腑矣。衲之所以不先見告者。正以此耳。某旣起沈疴。饋僧多金以爲報。僧不受曰。方外雲游。無需此物也。亦高僧已。考諸雲麓漫鈔。以水仙花爲金琖銀臺。今據蜀僧所稱之金盤銀琖。不知古醫書中。有是名目否。還以質諸當世醫學專家。</p>
<h3>水鏡</h3>
<p>— 以思</p>
<p>粤東省南海縣九江鎭農人。多以養魚魣爲業。該業中人。有測水奇術。每歲立春日。擅此術者。臨河邊汲水一瓦盌。祗用數指量其輕重。即知是年水漲之高度。有無水患。屢試不爽。誠奇技矣。</p>
<p>又可於春冬之交。觀蟬蛻粘於何處。距地高低。亦可預知是歲水漲之深淺云。惜僅知其然。而不能說其所以然耳。順科學家注意及之。</p>
<h3>留聲機畔消夏記</h3>
<p>— 孤雁</p>
<p>火繖高張。令人如坐洪爐中。際此盛暑。何以消遷。欲求身心之快感。不得不另關谿徑。以資取樂。乃向友人假得蓓開公司最新樣片一套。計三士　種。逐一細聽。竟三晝夜而尙不覺厭。眞能引人入勝也。茲以愚見所及。特爲評而記之。馬連良之斬子。使腔别具風格。劉跛從此不得專美於前。打侄上墳以念白見長。王少樓之長板坡嘆五更。清越流利。戞然獨造。寳蓮燈昔日裏二黄快三眼。飄逸處直逼叔岩。與尙小雲合唱秋胡戲妻。唱念俱佳。言菊朋之珠簾寨。聲如金石。頗見工力。譚小培羅文奎之賣馬。對口緊凑。一絲不懈。尙小雲之敎子。佳嗓天生。獨擅勝塲。相思寨勸農。新腔迭奏。流麗動聽。雪艶琴譚富英合唱之探母坐宫。雪以甜媚勝。譚以蒼老見長。可謂二美俱。雪艶琴蕭長華之蘇三起解。一則運腔有味。一則京白道地。杜麗雲之芙蓉劍。與玉霜　之駡殿。可　謂異曲同工。玉堂春探監之快三眼。唱片上從未有過。麗雲破格爲之。亦自新頴動聽。金少山馬富祿合唱之法。門寺與探陰山兩片。對唱對白。旣雄偉又乾脆。論結搆已屬登峯造極。李多奎之甘露寺與斬子。得龔處之神髓。鼓王劉寳全之博望坡與徐母駡曹二曲。氣派大方。勁頭十足。白雲鵬之黛玉歸天與白帝城。旖旎雄偉。兼而有之。老倭瓜之醒世金鐸與張冶兒之四敎歌。唱來詼諧百出。淋漓盡致。不愧南北二大滑稽之稱。餘如王彩雲之小調。沈儉安薛小卿之珍珠塔。劉翠霞李玉芬文金舫之繃繃調。胡周叔安女士及包庸珍女士之新派歌曲。德國之軍操。俄國之船夫曲等片。唱者旣聚全副精神。收音復清亮準確。是以莫不妙曼動聽。投吾片迷之所好也。</p>

<h3>印度遊記（八○）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>自昨日起。報載甘地與政府已相諒解。將停止一切不合作運動。而政府之條件。則召集全國會議。余問人此事。甘地能否實行取消各種運動。人言此甘地之策。一時間休息。藉以召集全國會議。爲大宣傳。若彼時會議不要。再决裂。其合羣力更大也。甘地平生在獄中生活時頗多。一次六年。一次四年。共經五六次云。宜乎其面無笑容。而多涕泣也。甘地式革命。向内之革命也。嗚呼。可謂難矣。成功則吾不知也。昨沙彌等講演報告美體情形。而一場中述甘地名字十餘次。蓋全印度之於甘地。如中國之念阿彌陀佛焉。</p>
<p>昔孔子曰。人而不如鳥乎。蓋爲鳥易。爲人難。回印兩敎之大不同。回禁食猪。而印禁食牛。二者皆禁物也。然當西歷七四三年時。有回王名Walid　II威力第二。輕蔑可蘭經。公然食猪飲酒。不作禱告。而當年印度敎有聖者名古六那開沙Gurn　Nanak　Saheb者。創一新派。調和回印。收兩敎之人。而成一新派。回敎中有慈善派之人。亦贊成其禁食牛主義。頗歸向之。後其徒頗占勢力。與咽敎衝突。互殺甚多。至今尙有七萬徒衆。成爲新派敎。當其相戰也。印人亦故意用猪骨以敵之。一猪一牛。在西亞與中亞。印度成最大問題。猶之滿清入關。因一辮髮。殺人無算。中世宗敎之爭。因一偶像殺人無數萬。今馬克司欲以單一之唯物史解决之。蓋似未易易也。試久居印回之間。則知許多問題。大半由於宗敎習慣信仰風俗之不同。絶非物質問題。即如猪牛二禁。純與物質無關也。將奈之何哉。若在埃及。則貓亦成一大問題。因古埃及有殺貓之刑。其刑甚重。幾等於殺人云。五方殊俗。做人不亦難乎。</p>

<h3>女人女人（一九）</h3>
<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>小榮的妻子一聽得他們已經回到了上海去，心裏好生難過，但也没有法想，只得怏怏而歸。伊又那裏會知道小榮祗是搬過了一家旅館呢！</p>
<p>伊回到了家裏，越想越不放心，越想越憂慮：伊覺得非去尋見小榮自己問問不可。因此，伊就想定了一個方法，决計自己。當時，伊就跟伊的公公和婆婆一商量，大家覺得這個方法不錯。所以伊問明了而且牢牢地記住了小榮讀書的學堂的地址以後，約略帶了一些車費，就單身不顧一切地趕到上海去了。</p>
<p>在這一天之中，小榮伴着丁小姐在蘇州，玩了兩天，也玩得有些疲倦了；而且小榮也常常躭憂着也許有更多的不幸的事會尋到他，所以他就對丁小姐說要回上海去。丁小姐也不反對。</p>
<p>小榮的妻子到了上海以後，就雇了車依着記住的地址一直到小榮的學堂裏去。伊就在門房裏問着：「這裏有一個蘇州學生姓陸呌榮卿的在不在？」</p>
<p>「陸榮卿！有是有的！現在不在校裏！」那個管門房的人望了一望牆壁上掛着的牌子，就這麽回答。</p>
<p>「那麽他那裏去的呢？今夜會回來麽？」伊又問。</p>
<p>「這是不知道的！」</p>
<p>伊没有法子，祗得在校門口坐着等候。伊的惟一的希望，便是小榮回到學校裏來能夠給伊遇見。可是一小時兩小時的過去，直等到夜裏八點鐘，始終還是使伊失望，然而伊還是耐心地守着不走。那個管門房的人也覺得驚奇了，就問着伊說：「你找陸榮卿有什麽緊要的事麽？你只要告訴了我，由我給你轉達就是了，若是你老等着他，那說不定等幾天也等不到的！因爲現在是暑假期内啊。」</p>
<p>伊還是不走，想想自己的前途，不禁暗暗灑了幾滴眼淚。直到十點鐘時候，校門要關了，伊才没有旁的方法再逗留在這裏，只得失望地蹩着自去，在附近尋了一個小旅館住下。</p>
<p>一夜只是睡不成，哭也哭了好幾回，一等到天亮，又立刻趕到小榮的校裏來</p>
<p>「陸榮卿回來了麽？」伊問。</p>
<p>「没有！」那看門房的很驚奇地回答。於是，伊仍舊在校門口的椅子上坐着等候。</p>
<p>許多出出進進的學生們，看見了這樣一個愁容滿面的女人坐在校門口，大家就查究起來了。恰巧那個李文耀這天到學校裏來，大家就談到了這件事情。</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市趨勢不一</h3>
<p>紗市晨跌午漲、趨勢依然紊亂、變動頗速、但美棉依然微跌、故抛賣者尙不乏人、午後以美國農政局有將美棉廢收三分之一消息、於是人心大爲震動、形勢驟變、買氣緊張、各月飛躍二兩外、後有大戶賣出、收盤略回、多數預料美棉有轉漲可能、所以市氣大爲緊俏、明日市價恐仍有大變象、榮興號仍購進加碼、而額子尙巨、不過實際情形不佳云、</p>
<p>人標晨低午高　人標前市開盤、以外棉狀况不佳、市况甚疲、各跌五·六錢至二·四·七錢、午後以美棉消息狂漲二兩外、後以大戶壓迫、稍跌數錢、成交計八萬八千三百五十包、查賣出公泰一千二百包、瑞大四千二百包、大孚二千包、賡豐二千六百五十包、義餘一千五百五十包、新華一千四百包、信誠四千一百五十包、買進吉豐一千五百包、榮興四千七百包、益昶三千○五十包、大昶二千三百五十包、長豐一千包、梅記一千二百包、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市午後回好</h3>
<p>棉市始跌繼好、但外棉依然不振、而金價又軟化、且國外過剩、使人不安、所以人心頗虚、賣氣甚濃、午後因美國農政局有將美棉廢减三分之一消息、不過此項建議能否實現、尙屬疑問耳、商塲上人心驟緊、買氣大旺、市盤遂飛漲五·六錢、但各大戶仍賣出、棉市前途、殊缺乏把握也、</p>
<p>漢標受美棉之惠　漢標前市開盤、因世界棉市仍不振、人心仍虚、各跌四·八·五·錢、午後以美棉消息、狂漲四·五·六錢、成交計廿一萬一千九百擔、查賣出恒大四千擔、天隆三千七百擔、瑞大九千五百擔、信誠八千二百擔、源大三千四百擔、協生二千丸百擔、買進和愼五千擔、賡豐八千五百擔、信誠三千三百擔、新亨四千四百擔、振大三千九百擔、大昶四千一百擔、大昌成三千二百擔、大豐三千一百擔、茲將收盤價錄左</p>

<h3>毁損美棉三分之一之建議</h3>
<p>十二日華盛頓電　農部致書十四省植棉區域之總督、提議毁損新棉三分之一、如各省能協助實行、美政府將於翌年扣留其所囤之一百三十萬、不使人市塲云、按八月八日政府估計、棉産達（一五、五八四、○○○包、）七月底之滾存、爲（九、一三○、○○○包、）政府囤棉、爲（一、三○○、○○○包、）合計有（二六、○一四、○○○包、）如能毁損新棉三分之一、農部扣存囤棉、則美棉現有約達（一九、五○○、○○○包、）</p>
<p>又訉、毁損美棉三分之一之建議、如有十大省接受、或將見諸實行云、</p>
<h3>糧食米市閘北猛跌一元</h3>
<p>南市暫見平定</p>
<p>南市　各帮來源晨間風阻仍乏、近十時始見稍接、計抵同里北　黎里練塘四號、南港三四號、平湖二十二三號、各貨上落有限、眞特别常粳開出十八元九角、中次照别、洋米貨雖不多、客帮及本街去路似嫌價加過昂、略爲轉鬆、市形呈疲、</p>
<p>閘北　西路來源尙旺、本街交易愈覺呆滯、薄稻早稻二種、雖斛開近千石、形勢猛瀉一元光景、蘇常白粳及崑山米各跌七八角、蘆洋尖及埠尖胃口寥寥、下游之象、糯米到仍零星、酒戶雖木、本街去路鮮高頗爽、市形開盤降瀉半元、新粳裝來近百石、裕成泰和盛二家合買、行盤均未成交云、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷赤續開二千餘袋</h3>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訉、古巴現糖價未變動、紐約期糖十二月份比跌一分、明年度五月份反比升一分、餘月均無升降、爪哇現期糖亦依然無起伏、公會市塲劃盤交易均寥、實以去化呆滯之故、但人氣尙屬堅秀、荷糖二十四號粗砂白新貨十一兩五錢半、二十號中砂白十一兩○五分、磨細砂白十一兩六錢半、八九號荷赤九兩四錢、碗靑八兩七錢半、太古糖Ｂ　十二兩一錢、ＣＷ　十一兩九錢、ＤＹ　十一兩九錢半、ＨＭ　十一兩四錢半、ＨＸ　十一兩八錢半、交易均皆凋零、市形殊平、號盤有裕祥廠開出氷花靑百餘袋、價元十兩○四錢半、華新號售開現貨八九號荷赤二千餘袋、價九兩四錢半、需要尙盛、如數售通、市象尙　俏俐云、</p>
<h3>五福白冰號盤呌漲</h3>
<p>五福白冰前以天氣炎熱、廈廠暫停工作、迄未開煮、故來源極稀、而存底亦少、近日陸續開出、價爲八兩九錢、茲據該廠電訉、因原料漲價、存冰擬加升二三錢、始肯允出、是以號盤正在扳持中、非漲不售云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　夏繭絲三十件運杭</h3>
<p>今歲江浙各屬繭、收成歉折、繭質優良者少、無錫等處所産之夏繭、繅成之廠絲、祗合内地綢門銷路、綢商因冬綢需要、曾向滬廠抛進夏繭絲爲數不弱、昨由滬杭中班車運杭三十件、係緯成綢廠所購之期貨云、</p>
<h3>廠經歐銷寥落</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲經交易依然寥落、查海内各絲織廠現均預備暑假開工、對於黄白廠經雖有進胃、而嫌價昂、電轉寥落、昨祇連納進滬白廠經十包、信孚進魯黄廠經十五包、美大進黄粗絲十包、價均堅挺云、</p>
<h3>茶市續趨堅漲</h3>
<p>昨日來路莊之珍眉大帮綠茶、英莊怡和協和錦隆天祥等行、進意續趨濃厚、其中婺東歙縣遂安等路貨、市况最爲俏俐、行情暴漲一二十兩、其餘屯溪婺北各路貨、市勢亦均有漲無跌、貢熙一項、俄國協助會銷胃浩大、惟因近來白頭莊及華茶公司乘機搜辦、華商態度堅硬、不願讓價求售云、</p>

<h3>法國諷刺畫家佛汗逝世</h3>
<p>— 岳崙</p>
<p>最近畫壇莫大的一個損失、那就是法國著名的諷刺畫家佛汗（Ｆorain）之逝世、我恨不能即時跑到巴黎、獻花圈於佛汗畫家靈前、特撰此短文介紹這位死了的畫家於愛好藝術同志之前、藉作爲我對於這位畫家的哀悼、</p>
<p>星期五的中夜、巴黎街上底行人還在熙擾着、那著名的佛汗畫家即於此時與世長辭了、陪伴着畫家之死的祗有他底賢慧的妻子、那病人呻吟之聲頓時變成了哀號的痛哭、房子的周圍呈現着凄凉之象、遺留下的祗有我們畫家平生底作品和他所崇拜的畫家Danmier　Corat底幾幅掛在壁上的素描、</p>
<p>佛汗生於一八五二年十月、十六歲從家博Ｃarpeaux研習雕刻、理想着將來作一個雕刻家、同時想由此成功歷史上一個偉大的人物、人說歷史上偉大的人物、他們的癖性或舉動多有普通人們認爲「怪」的、佛汗畫家却正也不能例外、諸位想想、佛汗不是學雕刻的麽、爲甚麽他後來竟成了一個諷刺畫的名家呢、講起這段歷史、却是有趣味得很、原來這位畫家之所以成爲畫家、全是因爲挨了枉寃駡、以致使他爲學的態度、頓然改變了方向、這完全是偶然的意外的遭際、事情是這樣的、有一次同班的班長、不幸撞了大禍、把先生家傳所作的皇太子像底右手損壞了、班長怕受責備、於是便誣賴是佛汗損壞的、先生大怒、也不追究事情的眞相、便突然地將這無辜的學生逐去他底雕刻室、</p>
<p>靑年藝術家突然遭了這樣的寃枉、這寃枉竟使他失掉學習的地方、自然免不得十分憤氣、這憤氣的結果竟使他打消了初志、而移其趣味於諷刺人生繪畫的練習、後來竟成功現代法國最有權威的諷刺畫家、自來藝術家或别的偉大的人物往往因受了枉寃、使他向别的方面努力、由新的努力産生出偉大不朽的作品或事業來、歷史上頗不乏這類的例子、就拿中國的屈原來說罷、如果不是「上官大夫」與他「同列爭寵」、在懷王面前說他的壞話、致使遭了疏遠、也許我們的詩人作一輩子官以没世了、哪裏還有相傳幾千年的「離騷」供後人吟誦啊、由這點看來、偉大的藝術家和其他偉大的人物之造成、也許都需要刺激罷、在歐戰時、我們的畫家曾當過兵士、曾上過沙塲與敵人衝鋒陷陣、并曾因戰功而獲着十字章（Croix　de　Ruere）、加斯特蘭（Castelman）說、「他底勇敢與意志可以爲軍士的模範、」</p>
<p>講到佛汗底繪畫是現代法國諷刺畫的權威者、得過地方榮譽章（La　Commandent　de　la　Region　I'bonnens）做過諷刺會的會長、一九二三年被選爲美術研究院委員、國家美術協會評判委員長、英國皇家油畫研究院曾聘氏爲名譽委員、Fifre、巴黎世界（Monde'　Parisiene）、Figaro、法國通訊（Ｃotrier　Francaise）、巴黎潮（Ech　　　de　Paris）巴黎生活（La　ViaParisien）、日報Ｊonrnal一等報紙和雜誌上都常有佛氏的作品、</p>
<h3>革命成功後的西班牙文壇</h3>
<p>— 椿</p>
<p>文藝往往是革命的導火綫、這話常常是應騐着、雖然很有一部份人反對文藝工具化、然而在某個緊急時期、實在也是未能抑止了這種意識的、蓋文藝家的靈感不能不受客觀的社會環境的支配、人民有合理生活要求的需要、在文藝上的表現、當然是更爲急切、這次西班牙共和革命的告成、當然也不能逃出這個例外、我們祇看著名小說家伊本納茲（vicente　Blasco　Ibonez）之努力於革命運動到處鼓吹革命、在他的小說上、革命意識的有力的暴露和激刺、皆足證明西班牙文壇對於革命運動之瘋狂和熱感、不幸的、是伊本納茲因失敗而亡命、卒至死於法國、未及見革命的成功、但是近年來由於革命運動的高潮而爲捲入實致政治活動的漩渦、在西班牙文壇上除伊本納茲外、尙大有人在、</p>
<p>這次西班牙的共和告成、在政體上固然有新的生命的表現、而影響及於文壇的、確也有一種不平凡表現、在此我不想說到理論的轉換或甚至提供貨色的問題、我所提出來的、是共和政府成立、都即派遣一般文壇作家、分任爲各國大使或公使、這眞是别開生面、也許是空前創舉、因爲重要的國家幾都爲他們占去了、我想基人他國家對於外交官的任命還没像這樣佈置的吧、其引起各國文壇的法意、也是必然、</p>
<p>現在就所知道的人名、寫在下邊、</p>

<p>二、以通俗小說著名、文名在西班牙最普遍的曼台黎愛琪（Salvador　de　Madariaga）駐美、</p>

<h3>路威士連奬章都不要了</h3>
<p>不久前曾爲人摑頰而傳爲文壇笑柄的那新得諾貝爾奬金的路威士、最近不知又發什麽脾氣、居然要把那塊金奬章贈與耶魯大學的Ｎew　Sterling紀念圖書館、豈知該校當局竟淡然視之、毫無表示、到反使路威士弄得進退爲難、大不好意思、據聞此中是爲某項誤會、尙未得諒解云、若路威士者、可謂不幸之至的諾貝爾奬金的得奬者了、（椿）</p>
<h3>肖像畫的復興</h3>
<p>在過去的二十年中肖像畫大爲法人所忽視、現在却有復興的趨勢了、最近巴黎有大規模的歷代肖像畫展覽之舉行、這個展覽會的目的、一方面是在於引起一般人對於肖像畫的注意、一方面希望給畫家們一些感興、使他們轉向肖像畫方面去致力、以促成肖像畫藝術的復興、</p>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>所以各軍須研究敵軍後方的組織、以　斷敵軍是否有後退行動、須常常嚴　偵察敵情、有無退却模樣、更須準備追　、以免敵軍有全師而退的機會、</p>
<p>七月廿四日、泰屯拿方面勝利的戰事正在進行的時候、聨軍各總司令—海格元帥、貝當將軍、和潘興將軍、—在朋朋地方我的司令部會集、同我研究將來的計劃、我請我的參謀長魏肯將軍把上述的計劃書讀給他們、各總司令見這計劃野心很大、範圍很廣、和作戰的次數很多、似有驚駭之意、</p>
<p>各總司令以其自身的立塲不同、各有其答語如下、</p>
<p>海格元帥——英軍經過三四兩月的戰事、幾完全瓦解、現距恢復尙達、</p>
<p>貝當將軍——法軍經過四年的惡戰、</p>
<p>現在精疲力竭、兵士均息淡血和貧血、</p>
<p>潘興將軍——美軍唯一的職志在打仗、不過現在美軍尙未編成、</p>
<p>在這種情形之下、我軍什樣考慮採取連續的大規模的攻勢戰呢、</p>
<p>我一面承認各總司令觀察的合理、一面堅持我的主張、我對所說的各軍暫時的弱點曾加相當注意、但也料到我軍適當的結合很足使預定的計劃有實行的可能、我軍尤其可以隨機應變的實行、我的意思是根據現在勝利的程度以定這計劃實行的迅速和迂緩、</p>
<p>各總司令並不正式表示反對、他們離開我的時候、各把這七月廿四日的計劃書帶去一本、翌日各在原則上表示贊同、（未完）</p>

<h3>Wang Shuchang Arrives in Beiping</h3>
<h3>Reports on the Progress of the Battle</h3>
<p>Fan Pujiang and Song Shiyan Arrive Together</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Personally Welcomes Him at the Station</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Shuchang arrived in Beiping this afternoon. Zhang Xueliang personally went to the station to welcome him. The station was heavily guarded by military police. Zhang Xueliang stood at the station, leaning on a cane, looking energetic and greeted him with a smile. After a brief exchange of greetings, he returned to the hospital to rest. At the same time, Wang Shuhan, Ji Yiqiao, Bao Yulin, and others also arrived at the station to welcome him. Those who came with Wang included Fan Pujiang, Ge Guangting, Fu Shuangying, and Song Shiyan, the representative of Han Fuju. Fan Pujiang said that he had met with Han Fuju in Jinan four times and expressed extreme sincerity. This time, he was ordered by the Deputy Commander to go to Jinan to report on the progress of the war and to ask for ways to accommodate the defeated soldiers of Shi. Fewer than 10,000 Shi troops entered Shandong. The Central Government allocated 100,000 yuan for accommodation expenses. Han expressed that if Yan resided in his old home in Shanxi and did not engage in activities, he could ask the Central Government to guarantee his safety. Otherwise, he should ask Yan to go abroad to avoid misunderstandings. Han plans to come to Beiping within days to meet Zhang, ask for instructions on the aftermath of North China, and plans to meet Xu Yongchang in Shijiazhuang to persuade Yan to leave the country as soon as possible, and arrangements can be made to ensure his safety along the way. Song Shiyan said that he came to Beiping on behalf of Chairman Han to express his gratitude and ask for instructions on everything. Han will obey the orders of the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief in everything. Han is extremely dissatisfied with Yan's return to Shanxi. More than 10,000 defeated Shi troops arrived in Shandong, with more than 8,000 rifles. Most are stationed in Linyi, and a small number are stationed in Dezhou. How to reorganize them will be determined by the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief. Important military officers of the Shi troops have all fled. Shi has fled to Dalian and then to Japan. He will visit Ji Yiqiao on the 14th, and then schedule a visit to the Deputy Commander to report everything in person. He will return to Jinan in four or five days. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Shuchang visited Zhang Xueliang in the afternoon to report on the progress of the battle at the front. They talked for about an hour. Wang returned to the Hotel des Nations to rest. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<p>(Taiyuan) Xu Yongchang assumed the position of acting chairman of Shanxi on the 12th. He only telegraphed the Central Government and Jiang and Zhang to report, expressing his humility. He did not hold any ceremonies. According to Xu, he is only acting temporarily. The internal structure of the provincial government and various departments will remain unchanged. The recent policy direction is to first focus on suppressing bandits. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Xu has not yet gone to the Provincial Government to take office. It is reported that he plans to have a sounder organization for the Provincial Government. The Shanxi military salaries have been fully paid. The deputy ministers and commissioners have all left Taiyuan. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Yongchang telegraphed Zhang Xueliang on the 13th, saying that he received a telegram from Yangyou, stating that Chairman Shang was transferring his troops out of Shanxi, and that the chairmanship of Shanxi Province would be taken over by Chang.

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Since Chairman Shang had transferred his troops out of Shanxi, he had no choice but to temporarily act on this day, hoping that instructions would be issued from time to time so that he could follow them. This is what he hopes for. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Yan Moves to Baifotang</h3>
<p>In the Southern Mountains of Dingxiang County</p>
<p>Passive Attitude, Will Go to Dalian Again</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Yan has moved to Baifotang in the southern mountains of Dingxiang County. He has a very passive attitude, and those who have visited him in recent days have been rejected. He is preparing to return to Dalian within days. The generals have a rather cold attitude towards Yan. Gu Renfa returned to Shanxi to negotiate with all parties on behalf of Jiang on the security of Shanxi and various internal issues. He has been in contact with the generals in recent days and is quite happy. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>

The area east of Yangquan on the Zhengtai Railway will be guarded by Feng Pengzhu's troops. Xu Yongchang will send other troops to guard the area between Taiyuan and Yangquan. Trains on this line run daily, but when passing through Yangquan, the engine power is sometimes insufficient and the trains need to be changed. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang Bingxun telegraphed Cao Mouchou, the director of his office in Beiping, on the 11th, saying that the vanguard of his division had arrived at Baijingyi in Pingshan today and would arrive in Shijiazhuang on the evening of the 14th.

<p>(Beiping) Liu Zhi, Shang Zhen, and Gu Zhutong were originally scheduled to leave Beiping at 11:00 last night, but due to temporary matters that needed to be dealt with, they did not leave until 1:30 this morning. Liu Zhi told reporters that the Shanxi issue has now been completely resolved. The Deputy Commander is responsible for assigning Xu Yongchang to preside over the military and political affairs of the entire province. The Central Army participating in the campaign against Shi will be completely demobilized. The defenses left behind in the Shunde and Handan areas will be filled by Wang Shuchang's troops. He will meet with Yu in Baoding before returning to Kaifeng. Shang Zhen said that the Deputy Commander has telegraphed Xu Yongchang to take office as soon as possible and be responsible for maintaining everything. He will return to Shijiazhuang and will not return to Shanxi for the time being. Gu Zhutong said that he plans to go to Shunde first to reorganize the troops, and then go to Xinxiang and return to Zhengzhou. Approximately 30,000 prisoners from Shi's troops have been reorganized in Shunde and will be transported to Nanjing for reorganization and training. Peng Qibiao, the chief of staff of Liu Zhi, said that the defensive areas of the North and South armies will be divided by the Zhang River. The area north of the river will be controlled and defended by the Deputy Commander's Xingying, and the area south of the river will be controlled and defended by the Kaifeng Xingying. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Baoding stated that Liu Zhi, Shang Zhen, and Gu Zhutong arrived in Baoding at 4:00 this morning. Yu Xuezhong greeted them at the station. After a brief conversation with Liu Shang and others, Liu and others' special train left south at 5:00.

<p>Drainage Project Completely Failed</p>

The Huangjingtang Dike, which protects against the Xiang River, is level with the water. The Chuanhan Railway base, which protects against the Houhu Lake, is also almost surpassed. A section of Boxue College was uprooted by the wind and water, presenting a particularly dangerous situation.

<p>Zhang Xueliang</p>
<h3>Telegraphed Thanks to the National Government for the Award</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed the National Government on the 13th, saying that he had received the Yangyou telegram with respect. During the Shi incident, Xueliang was incompetent and unable to prevent it beforehand, and was deeply frightened. Since being ordered to suppress the rebellion, he has relied on virtue and the friendly armies and subordinate officers and soldiers to fight against the enemy and destroy the rebels. Xueliang should have been diligent in his duties, but he was ashamed of the award. Reflecting on himself, he will work harder. In addition to respectfully conveying this to the subordinate officers and soldiers, he respectfully telegraphed the reply, hoping for your understanding. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>

As for the request to issue disaster relief public bonds, Jiang and Cai Song both agreed, and the Ministry of Finance is rushing to draft regulations, which will be guaranteed by alcohol and tobacco taxes and will be realized soon. This money will focus on relief through public works and agricultural relief. In addition to maintaining agricultural production next year, it will also seek fundamental prevention methods.

Jiang recently replied by telegram, saying that he had telegraphed Minister Song to handle it. Jiang telegraphed Xu on the 11th, saying that the disaster victims in Hubei Province were in dire need of relief and hoped that he would send someone to investigate and plan quickly.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Urgent Problem of People's Food (4)</h3>
<p>Yesterday's commentary was not exhaustive. I would like to continue speaking today.</p>
<p>Fifth, it is necessary to maintain the economic wellbeing of the farmers. The economic decline of the farmers has reached its peak. High rents, advance collection of land taxes, the rural economy is on the verge of collapse. Farmers cannot even make a living, let alone improve agriculture and increase production. In the future, this accumulated malpractice should be thoroughly rectified to alleviate the suffering of farmers and give agriculture a chance to improve. Sixth, it is necessary to prevent natural disasters. Wind, hail, floods, droughts, and various changes in nature can all be prevented by artificial application of science. For example, afforestation can block wind and sand, and store water to prepare for droughts and floods. Dredging rivers and studying water conservancy can also provide relief in dry years and prevent rainwater from becoming a disaster. The government should earnestly study and plan for all these preventive measures as early as possible so that disasters will be eliminated forever and people's livelihood will be prosperous. Seventh, it is necessary to promote hoarding. The old policy of famine preparedness in our country originally had the method of hoarding in righteous granaries. Generally, after the autumn harvest, farmers often sell their harvest cheaply to repay urgent debts. (Special dispatch from the 13th) When spring and summer intersect, when the old grain is exhausted and the new crop is not yet ripe, food is tight, and those who sold cheaply before have no way to survive. If hoarding is promoted, it should be widely accommodated when it is sold cheaply, and then sold at a fair price when there is an urgent need. If there is still a surplus, it should be stored to prepare for famine, so that in good years, people can be warm and well-fed, and in bad years, they can be spared from death. Eighth, it is necessary to prohibit the planting of opium seedlings. The addiction to opium is prevalent throughout the country. There is a great profit, so farmers are happy to plant it, and many are forced to plant it. Provinces such as Sichuan, Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi all plant it. In Rehe alone, the planted land reaches more than one million mu, and the annual tax reaches more than ten million. Poisonous weeds cover the land, and the people are reduced to criminal status. Its direct and indirect impact on agricultural production is immeasurable. If this is not prohibited for a long time, how can the people's food not be reduced day by day? It will even destroy our country and exterminate our race. Ninth, it is necessary to implement disarmament. In ancient times, soldiers were housed among the farmers, so the army was sufficient and agricultural affairs were not neglected. Today, according to statistics from September of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], our country has a troop strength of 2,599,200 people. In reality, other miscellaneous troops are not included. Police and local defense forces are not included. Clerks and servants in government offices are not included. If a comprehensive statistic were made, the number would be so large that it could open a new world record for ancient and modern times. Such a huge number of people not only do not produce, but only sit and consume, and even disturb farmers and hinder agricultural work. If we do not implement disarmament and return them to farming, there will inevitably be fields but no one to cultivate them. Tenth, it is necessary to immigrate and reclaim wasteland. There is still much wasteland in the northeast and northwest of our country. According to the Northeast Yearbook statistics, in the northeast alone, there are 207,106,157 mu of wasteland. With such a vast virgin land, but without immigration and development, allowing the internal suffering of population congestion and the external opening of the coveting of strong neighbors, is truly great stupidity. According to the statistics of the Social and Economic Survey Committee of Nankai University, in the 17th year of the Republic [1928], only 1,089,000 immigrants entered the Northeast, and 578,000 people left. In the 18th year [1929], 1,046,291 people entered, and 621,897 people left. However, there is no organization for transplantation, and those who move away often have no way to live, and many eventually return to their homeland. Therefore, in the future, an immigration bureau should be established to be in charge of this policy, coordinating the overall situation and making detailed plans so that those who leave can live in peace and enjoy their work, so as to develop resources and increase agricultural production.</p>
<p>All these ten are essential plans for fundamental solutions, and they are also the great ways to save our country's livelihood. If they can be implemented, then externally, we can resist aggression, and internally, we can achieve strength and wealth. What is there to seek that cannot be obtained?</p>
<p>Moreover, our country is founded on agriculture. Although the agricultural economy is currently on the verge of bankruptcy, the industrial economy has not yet been established. Imperialists are invading with their strong industrial economy. Those who rely on standing firm in the middle stream and supporting the critical situation are still the farmers who work hard all year round but cannot get enough to eat. The above-mentioned ways to treat the symptoms and the root causes are indeed to save the people from death, but how can they not also save our country from bankruptcy? At this critical moment of survival, if we do not have the greatest determination to relieve the people from their suffering and relieve the country from its difficulties, then the future of this country, which is founded on agriculture, is in danger. How can it be just a matter of people's food?</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Economic Committee</h3>
<h3>Discusses Balancing the Budget</h3>
<p>Opinions Fail to Align</p>
<p>Conservative Party Leader Rushes Back to London</p>
<p>Preparing to Participate in a Tripartite Meeting</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th: The necessity of balancing the budget remains a point of public discussion. Yesterday, the Cabinet Economic Committee met for three hours without issuing a public statement. Investors are conducting their economic research through private debates. The next budget has indeed been forcibly balanced by the authorities, and the balancing method is to severely cut social and defense expenditures. However, the Socialist Party is clamoring for "increased taxes rather than reduced policies." Some also advocate issuing national lottery bonds, with annual or semi-annual draws for prizes, believing that this is more advantageous than the bond conversion plan. As for the bond conversion plan, it is said that the cabinet's opinions are not entirely the same, and radical supporters of the government are openly making boastful statements, leading to the strange talk of forced conversion. Although those in charge dismiss this as unfounded, many bondholders are unable to sleep peacefully due to this rumor. Bonds have already been affected by the rumor, especially the 5% war bonds, which have fallen to their lowest level in years. The general opinion is that if the government does not have a predetermined economic procedure, it may not be able to implement an automatic conversion plan. Forced conversion is clearly contrary to justice and not only damages Britain's reputation for upholding the sanctity of contracts. Banks and insurance companies willing to cooperate fully with the government will certainly warn the government about the sanctity of contracts. Moreover, banks and insurance companies hold government bonds worth approximately 500 million pounds, and their power is indeed not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th: Five key government officials, who constitute the Cabinet Economic Committee, interrupted their vacations and gathered in London. Today, they began considering the government's expenditure reduction program. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM without a concrete decision, but they must reconvene tomorrow and prepare a plan by the middle of next week. Conservative Party leader Baldwin is currently in France, and the leadership is temporarily held by Neville Chamberlain. Chamberlain's hurried return to London from Scotland has attracted considerable attention because of the talk of a tripartite meeting.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th: Baldwin suddenly returned to London from the European continent this morning. The prospect of a tripartite meeting to discuss the current economic situation is therefore very promising. Neville Chamberlain also returned here from Scotland. The two key officials discussed the attitude that the Conservative Party should take for two hours. The Cabinet Economic Committee has been discussing ways to balance the budget at the Prime Minister's residence since yesterday and is still in progress. George's representative, Samuel, has also been very busy at the Liberal Party headquarters for several days. Prime Minister MacDonald returned to Scotland today to continue his rest.</p>

The newspaper is often known for its exclusive confidential information, so it is highly regarded by the German people. According to the report, the German and French governments have agreed in principle on the issue of disarmament. It may be approved when the French leader visits Germany at the end of this month. In the spring, the two governments will independently guarantee to limit land and naval expenditures, but Germany will be allowed to freely dispose of them to replenish its defense weaknesses: first, to organize a small-scale air force; second, to increase heavy artillery in eastern border fortresses. Although these two items are inconsistent with the Treaty of Versailles, the newspaper believes that if the French agree, other countries will not protest. France is willing to make this concession in order to proceed with the four-nation pact of Britain, Italy, France, and Germany, thereby ensuring the partial success of next year's disarmament conference. Because, according to the current situation, if Germany insists that the old Allies fulfill their disarmament guarantees in accordance with the treaty, the disarmament conference will inevitably fail. Although political circles do not believe that France can make such concessions to Germany, they attach great importance to this news, and there is no shortage of those who believe in the trend. When asked by the authorities, they neither deny nor confirm it.</p>
<h3>Tensions Rise in Cuban Turmoil</h3>
<p>President Has Lost Popular Support</p>
<p>National News Agency, Havana, 12th: Today, the revolutionary situation is becoming increasingly tense. In Luyano, on the outskirts of the city, revolutionary forces and government troops are engaged in fierce fighting. The number of deaths is unknown. Major battles are also taking place in Sancti Spiritus and Pinar del Rio. After the President ordered the revolutionary forces to return by midnight yesterday, there was no effect, and the anger of the opposition party increased. Today, attacks on government forces are intensifying. In short, when this revolution will end is still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Another telegram: Today, the commander of the government forces stated that the government forces in Pinar del Rio Province have won a great victory, and all enemy forces have surrendered.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 13th: The US government does not want to interfere in the Cuban turmoil. Official opinion is that the turmoil has not yet reached the point of intervention. However, according to a New York Times reporter in Havana, the entire island is in turmoil, and the people are rising up with weapons to resist the government.</p>

<h3>Crack Down on Radical Actions</h3>
<p>Communist Organs Searched</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 12th: The atmosphere in Berlin is quite tense tonight. A large number of police officers have been transferred into the city to prevent a recurrence of last night's disturbances. In Berlin's Mattai, Lyunaburg and other places, there have been incidents of communists shooting at the police, injuring 12 people and detaining 60 people. Acheng and other places were searched door-to-door and discovered a secret organization called the Red Attackers' Association, which specializes in dealing with the National Socialist Party and the police. Fifty people have been arrested, including one Communist member of parliament and two city councilors.</p>
<h3>Muslim-Hindu Conflicts in India</h3>
<p>Cause Very Minor</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 13th: In Talai Ismail Khan, a dispute over prices between a Muslim shopkeeper and a Hindu customer led to a major conflict, resulting in three deaths, 17 injuries, and the burning of 400 Hindu homes. Order has not yet been restored. Troops have been dispatched from Lahore to suppress the unrest. Before the arson attacks, there were many robberies.</p>
<p>US Department of Agriculture</p>
<h3>Measures to Rescue the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Proposes Destroying One-Third of Cotton Production</p>
<p>Plan to Sell on Credit to Germany Fails</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 12th: The US Department of Agriculture has suggested to the governors of 14 cotton-producing states that they destroy one-third of this year's cotton production. If the states agree, the US government can keep the cotton it has stockpiled for another year without selling it. This plan could reduce the total supply of US cotton by at least four million bales. In addition, three million bales may not be sold on the market this year. If ten of the largest cotton-producing states accept this proposal, then this plan must be implemented.</p>
<p>Reuters, Osaka, 13th: After the report of the US Department of Agriculture's proposal to destroy a portion of cotton was released, yarn prices rose by four to five yuan.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 12th: The plan to sell wheat and cotton to Germany on credit by the United States is now considered to be in vain. Because after the Federal Agricultural Relief Bureau opposed Germany's purchase of 600,000 bales of cotton on credit, Washington is also not welcoming Germany's purchase of American wheat on credit. Therefore, the US President has ordered the US Ambassador to Germany, Sackett, to stop negotiations.</p>
<h3>Widespread Labor Unrest in Spain</h3>
<p>Political Situation Unstable</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 12th: Recently, there has been unrest and repeated disturbances in Spain, and strikes have been endless. According to keen observers, these are all signs of political instability. In Barcelona, 40,000 miners were already on strike, and now more than 10,000 workers from rubber and hardwood factories have joined the strike. There have been frequent clashes between strikers and the police. The situation in Tarragona is particularly bad. Unemployed workers there are demanding relief, and their momentum is fierce. The authorities are unable to cope. The unemployed workers have now organized a committee and announced that they will launch a general attack on factories, businesses, and households tomorrow. The government has dispatched heavy troops to suppress the unrest. In Cordoba Province, more than 100 members of the Communist Party and allied factions have been arrested. They were plotting to establish a red government in Cordoba Province and had mobilized all labor and peasant organizations, announcing a general strike at the same time. Before this conspiracy was discovered, many labor unions had agreed to support it.</p>
<h3>Severe Earthquake in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 13th: Seismologists at the Imperial University claim that the school's newest seismograph indicates that there has been an earthquake in Xinjiang, as severe as the one that occurred in Gansu a few years ago. The instruments at observatories around the world have indicated this earthquake. According to the famous seismologist Imamura, the epicenter is between the northern and southern ridges of the Tianshan Mountains.</p>
<h3>Vatican Opposes Adoption of New Calendar</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 13th: The Vatican has sent a letter to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, opposing the new calendar. Signed by the Pope, it does not approve of fixing the date of Easter or dividing the year into thirteen months, saying that several items in the new calendar are incompatible with Christian traditions and doctrines. It sees no reason for a hasty change of calendar. However, if the world believes that a change of calendar is necessary, and the General Assembly of the League of Nations passes a calendar change proposal, and an international committee of experts is organized to formulate a feasible plan, then it would be happy to consider the whole issue.</p>
<h3>Australian Aviator Arrives in Kagoshima</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 13th: Australian aviator Chick Chandler arrived in Kagoshima from Shanghai at about 7:00 PM tonight. The journey should have taken five or six hours, but it was delayed to about ten hours. The authorities are currently questioning Chandler about whether he was forced to land en route.</p>
<h3>Strange Phenomenon in a Gold Standard Country</h3>
<p>Unemployed Steal Food in Downtown Areas</p>
<p>National News Agency, Oklahoma City, 12th: Today, a group of unemployed people drove a truck to a large grocery store and robbed food, placing it on the truck and setting fire to the store to cover their tracks. They then fled in the chaos. It is noteworthy that in the United States, the richest country in the world, there are unemployed people rioting and stealing food in downtown areas.</p>
<h3>Chen Youren Leaves Tokyo to Return Home</h3>
<p>电通社 [Den Tsushinsha - Japanese Telegraphic Communication Agency], Tokyo, 13th: Chen Youren, who was staying in Tokyo, is scheduled to leave Tokyo on the special express train westward on the night of the 13th. On the 14th, he will take the President Harrison from Kobe via Shanghai to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Public Telegrams</p>
<p>Telegram from Kaifeng: All newspapers equally: The people of Henan are unfortunate and have suffered a terrible disaster. Human-caused calamities have not ceased, and the floods are expanding. For more than a month, telegrams and letters have been sent in droves, and the situation is extremely painful. We have extracted and telegraphed a summary to request rescue. Now, according to the report from the Zhenwu (Disaster Relief) Sub-Association of Queshan County, on July 4th, torrential rain poured down, continuing day and night for over a day. The water depth on the plains reached over ten feet. Walls collapsed and houses crumbled, crops were submerged, and livestock and clothing were washed away. The magistrate of Zhenping County telegraphed that since the heavy rain on July 10th, the ditches and gullies in the county have been full, with little sunshine and much overcast weather. As of the 23rd, it has not yet cleared. A survey of the fields in various townships shows that they have all been flooded. The autumn crops throughout the fields are all damaged. Villagers are fleeing to the hills, crying for food. Standing water is vast, and there is no place to live. The heads of the districts in Yongcheng County reported that since the beginning of July, it has been overcast and rainy for ten days, and the autumn crops have been destroyed. Unexpectedly, on the 10th and 11th, torrential rain did not stop, even the high-lying areas were flooded. Most of the areas under the jurisdiction of each district were completely flooded, damaging houses and washing away people and livestock. The exact statistics are not yet clear. The situation in each of these counties is truly terrible, and urgent relief should be provided as soon as possible to help the survivors and save them from this great disaster. The Henan Provincial Disaster Relief Association, Zhang Fangyang.</p>
<p>Telegram from Nanjing: All newspapers, transferred to the Tianjin Fellow Countrymen Association, Duan Zhilao, transferred to Gong Xianzou, Wang Yitang, Lv Xiepu, Zhao Cuiran, Zhou Shizhi, Wang Kaisheng, and other gentlemen; Shanghai Anhui Fellow Countrymen Association, Xu Jinglao, transferred to Cheng Linsheng, Xu Jiyu, Li Weihou, Li Mvgong, Guan Yunnong, Yang Xiaotian, Qi Junhou, Hong Jiling, Chen Zhengyou, Xia Ronghou, and other gentlemen; Beiping Anhui Fellow Countrymen Association, Jiang Yulao transferred to Zhou Zhizhi, and all fellow countrymen: Anhui is unfortunate, and disasters are frequent. The survivors of the disaster cannot bear their fate. This year's continuous rain in July has caused the Huai area to sink in northern Anhui, and the Yangtze River to flood in southern Anhui. The Dasha Dyke along the river has almost completely collapsed. In total, there are sixty counties in our Anhui, and as many as forty-two counties have been affected by the disaster. The submersion of fields and crops, the death of people, the collapse of houses, and the drift of livestock cannot be counted. And the water level continues to rise and has not increased. There are currently no less than five million starving people without food or shelter. At this time when the poisonous flames are spreading, the old and weak may turn to the gutters, and the strong may be scattered in all directions. If they dare to take risks and cause trouble, where will the disaster end? Thinking of this, my heart and soul are torn apart. Although the government has relief agencies to discuss rescue, after all, our country's disaster area this year is vast, and a drop in the bucket will not help. The urgent needs of our hometown cannot be met without urgently rising up and rescuing ourselves. Fellow countrymen in Beijing organized an emergency relief fundraising association at the beginning of this month to raise donations for relief. However, limited to one corner, how much can be raised is still uncertain. I sincerely hope that all our fathers and elders of Anhui abroad will call out loudly and widely solicit donations to benefit the disaster victims, which is not a small amount. In addition to sending donation appeals and donation registers separately, this telegram is sent first. Anhui Fellow Countrymen Association in Beijing, Fundraising for Emergency Relief, bowed.</p>

<h3>Site of the Wanbaoshan Incident</h3>
<h3>Visit to Majiashao Pass (1)</h3>
<h3>(1) Introduction</h3>
<p>The Wanbaoshan incident, in which Koreans were planting rice, has alarmed the world and aroused public opinion, which was not what we expected. As the saying goes, "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Therefore, the planting of rice by Koreans is indeed a single spark, and the Japanese are the ones who fan the flames. Until the fire is blazing and the situation is uncontrollable, thousands of Korean compatriots who have nothing to do with it are sacrificed. Is this not the greatest unfortunate event of 1931?</p>
<p>Although the Wanbaoshan incident occurred due to Koreans planting rice, it was initially just an economic dispute between Chinese and Korean farmers. The reason why it has escalated into today's serious situation is actually due to the Battle of Majiashao Pass. Therefore, Majiashao Pass can be called the site of the Wanbaoshan incident, or the source of the greatest unfortunate event of 1931.</p>
<p>Majiashao Pass is a small ferry crossing on the Yitong River. There are only two or three households living there. It is 45 li from Changchun and 25 li from Wanbaoshan. If there had been no such battle, who would have paid attention to it? I have lived in Changchun for nine years and have never heard of it. In July of this year, the Geography Survey Group of the Central University came to Changchun and was going to visit Majiashao Pass. With the permission of the group, I happily joined them. The time was August 1st, exactly one month after the incident (July 12th).</p>
<h3>(II) From Changchun to Majia Shaokou</h3>
<p>Besides the five teachers and students from Zhongda University who were traveling together, there were also Mr. Lu Bingzhi, a section staff member from the Municipal Office named Guo, and five Ma policemen, making a total of thirteen people. We rode in two-wheeled carts. We set off at six in the morning. Because I left in a hurry, I did not bring my fountain pen or notebook. Even the glasses I usually wear were nowhere to be found. I didn't even have a sip of water for breakfast.</p>
<p>We went north out of the city, passing through Sandaogou, Wujiadian, and Shuiquan. We crossed the Dong Province Railway line, passed Paoshou Woneng, Yijianlou, and crossed the Yitong River. (Note that this is not Majia Shaokou, because there are two roads from Changchun to Wanbaoshan, east and west. The east road crosses the river here, and the west road crosses the river at Majia Shaokou. The west road is more desolate, so most people take the east road.) Then, passing Qianlou, Yijianpu, Shunjinpu, and Dafangzi, we arrived at the front village of Majia Shaokou (see Map 1), which is only about two li away from the sentry post. There are four or five households. In front is a water bubble, and to the west is a willow forest. It is obviously a low-lying area. No wonder the residents are worried about the Yitong River overflowing. The Ma police stayed behind, and we walked ahead, protected by them. We passed through a two-li-long willow fence and arrived near the sentry post. From a distance, we could see three cloth sheds on the riverbank, as well as Japanese police in military uniforms patrolling the bank. Section staff member Guo led us into the He family's residence (as shown in Figure 2), which had five main rooms. The west room was occupied by Japanese soldiers (as shown in the figure). Raincoats were hung on the door as curtains. Inside the house, there were many small guns hanging on the earthen wall. Several Japanese soldiers were sitting on the kang. Section staff member Guo handed over a letter of introduction from the Changchun Japanese Consulate. Then, a Japanese soldier led us out of the courtyard. I asked a woman in the courtyard, "What is your surname?" She replied, "He." When I left the courtyard and walked to the well, I saw a Japanese soldier leading a naked Japanese man coming towards us. He was walking and looking at the letter of introduction he was holding. There was a Chinese interpreter beside him. This naked Japanese man asked Professor Zhang Qiyun of Central University some questions and then led him to the sentry post.</p>
<h3>Figure 1</h3>
<h3>Figure 2</h3>
<h3>(III) A Twenty-Minute Stay</h3>
<p>We arrived at the sentry post at 10:10 AM. The Yitong River flows from east to west. The water is calm and about three zhang wide. There is a willow branch dam downstream to block the water. The south bank is a flat beach, and the north bank is raised. The Japanese soldiers set up three cloth tents on this high ground. The tents were shaped like ordinary street vendor stalls, but the top was a front and rear slope, like a roof. Each could accommodate five or six people lying down. The three tents were arranged in a row, about four or five steps apart. There were Japanese soldiers sitting or lying in the tents. In front of the tents were piles of rice bags and soy sauce barrels. In front of the easternmost tent was a large tree. Four Koreans were standing in front of the tree, cooking for the Japanese. Two Chinese farmers were sitting under the tree, operating the ferry for the Japanese (this is what others said, I don't know if it's true). At that time, a Zhongda student was taking pictures of the tents and was interfered with by the Japanese soldiers, who said that they were ordered not to allow anyone to take pictures here. A Japanese soldier came out of the tent, with a stern expression and tone, and insisted on tearing up the dry plates. Although we argued strongly, saying that we had only been exposed to light and not taken any pictures, they still didn't believe us. In the end, they opened the back cover and exposed the dry plates to the sun. As soon as this small dispute ended, we went west to the digging site. The trench was about twenty steps away from the tents (as shown in Figure 1). The river water flowed into it, and the color was green. Because it was a dozen steps away from the river, an earthen dam was blocking it, and the water could not flow. I walked along this dam, which was eight steps long, indicating that the trench was no more than two zhang wide. The trench stretched east and west along the river, cutting through the fields into two sections. I was standing on the earthen dam, using binoculars to look at the end of the trench, when suddenly, another dispute arose on the riverbank due to the Japanese photographing us. I heard Professor Zhang say, "Since you don't allow us to take pictures casually, you shouldn't take pictures casually either." At this time, the Japanese soldiers who were following me closely urged us to leave. We left the area at 10:30 AM. Unexpectedly, the once leisurely ferry crossing had become a heavily guarded forbidden area. We stayed in this forbidden area for only twenty minutes, but two small disputes arose. Everyone's face showed an extremely serious expression. The gap between Chinese and Japanese feelings was evident.</p>
<h3>(IV) The Terrifying Figure in the Farmers' Mouths</h3>
<p>When we were leaving the forbidden area of the sentry post, the naked Japanese man was explaining to Professor Zhang and others the reason why they were not allowed to take pictures. On the way, he asked the farmers standing in front of the well some questions. I asked, "How many Japanese soldiers live here?" A farmer replied, "A dozen, I don't know the exact number." "How many live in the He house?" "Five, including the naked one." "What kind of person is he?" An old man with white hair replied, "He is extremely fierce. Yesterday, he pulled out the green onions from my house. When I went to ask, he beat me up." Before he finished speaking, a dispirited young farmer said, "He bathes naked by the well and runs into the courtyard naked, scaring the women from coming out." Another farmer said, "He bullies us terribly. He is probably an official. He is the one standing with his thighs exposed in the front. Sir, you saw him, didn't you? The one who came before was Takahashi. After Takahashi left, he came. He is extremely fierce." I asked what his name was, but no one knew. I told our group that we had come from Nanjing specifically to investigate this matter. A farmer's face seemed to show a hint of comfort. At that moment, a light rain suddenly started. We bid farewell and had lunch at the Xing residence in the front village. I asked Section staff member Guo, and then I learned that the terrifying figure in the farmers' mouths was Kato, the assistant police inspector (equivalent to our country's patrol officer) who had guided us and was naked.</p>
<h3>(V) Mr. Xing's Remarks</h3>
<p>While waiting for lunch at the Xing residence, I asked the host, Mr. Xing, about the cause of the incident. Mr. Xing was in his thirties, with a square face and narrowed eyes. He wore a blue jacket and trousers and was barefoot in his shoes. He was talkative and relatively open-minded. He said, "In the second lunar month of this year, many Koreans suddenly came and kowtowed to the river, claiming to be worshiping the river and breaking ground. We then learned that Hao Yongde was leading Koreans to plant rice in the Jiangjia Wobao area (twenty li away from here) and was digging trenches. But at that time, they only broke ground and did not dig trenches. Until March, they actually started digging. They dug from Jiangjia Wobao to the west and from the riverbank to the east.</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>Continued Special</p>
<p>The residents of our second district gathered to resist and complained to the county government and the municipal office. On the sixteenth day of the fourth lunar month, Police Chief Lu came with soldiers. The Koreans agreed not to dig. The next day, they went back on their word. Lu detained ten Koreans. On the eighteenth, Lu came again, and Captain Tang also came. The Japanese police then joined the Koreans on that day. Lu left without result. At the end of the fourth lunar month, Chinese and Japanese officials came to investigate. The Japanese police withdrew and then came again. On the seventeenth day of the fifth lunar month (that is, July 1st of the Gregorian calendar), our side gathered more than four hundred people and started leveling the trench at noon on that day. Because of the interference of the Japanese police, a dispute arose. In the evening, Japanese police officer Takahashi said to our representatives, "The more of you come tomorrow, the better. Bring more guns, or prepare more coffins. Tomorrow, two thousand Japanese soldiers will come with machine guns and cannons, waiting for you." The next day, our side gathered more than one hundred people, mostly carrying guns for self-defense. Some could even shoot down solitary birds. More than twenty Japanese soldiers came. Our side started leveling the trench in the morning. The Japanese police pulled our farmers, but they were snatched back by our side. On that day, Police Sub-Inspector Nakagawa, wearing white clothes and a black beard, fired the first shot. Our side also retaliated. The Japanese fired east along the river, and our side shot from the west of the bridge. Then, I entered the He residence and used the artillery platform for cover. The shooting started at 8:00 AM and lasted until 10:00 AM, about two hours. Both sides fired blanks, so there were no casualties. After that, our government stopped leveling the trench, and the number of Japanese soldiers increased to more than forty. Although the number of Japanese soldiers has decreased recently, they still fired guns yesterday to show their power." I asked, "Has anyone talked about paying rent for the land that has been dug up?" Xing replied, "Although there is such talk, it has not been realized." "Who fired the first shot?" "It was definitely Nakagawa from the Japanese side." ( ) "Are there still any Koreans here?" "Only the four who cook for the Japanese. The rest are all in the Jiangjia Wobao area." "Have the Japanese police ever been stationed in this village?" "Not yet." "Has the Yitong River ever flooded before?" "It floods often. Sir, haven't you seen the water bubble in front of the door? The land along the river is low-lying, so there are floods every two or three years." "How much land does the trench occupy?" "About forty mu. The land of the Mu and Sun families has been dug up." At this point, lunch was served. The vegetables and rice were delicious.</p>
<p>(VI) Some Trivial News</p>
<p>Hardship is High. I heard that the rice planted by the Koreans is less than an inch tall and mostly dried up. Those living near Wanbaoshan have difficulty finding food and steal bean leaves at night to fill their stomachs. Their situation is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Pregnant Woman. A Yu surname woman living in Shaokou, 25 years old, was about to give birth when two Japanese soldiers suddenly entered the courtyard, making a lot of noise. The woman was frightened, and the baby could not be delivered and died two days later. She is a victim of the Wanbaoshan incident, but no one outside knows about it.</p>
<p>Impersonating a Reporter. A Chinese police officer named Tian, brought by the Japanese side, often goes to the countryside posing as a Dongbao newspaper reporter from this port to gather information. The farmers believe him to be true and often tell him the real situation, hoping that he will speak out for them. Who would have thought that he is Chinese in appearance but Japanese at heart? During the shooting, a bullet passed over his scalp, and he has not come back since. The farmers all say that this is a warning from heaven.</p>
<h3>(VII) Returning in the Rain</h3>
<p>At 3:30 PM that afternoon, we left the Xing residence and returned to the city. When we reached Shuiquan, a heavy rain suddenly came, pouring down. Except for me, who was holding an umbrella, everyone was soaked in the rain. Professor Zhang Qiyun took off his clothes in a civilian's house, wearing only a woolen blanket. I sat in the back of the cart, holding an umbrella to cover him. We couldn't help but laugh at each other. We arrived in the city after 7:00 PM. I and a Zhongda student met with Chief Zhou of the Municipal Office to express our gratitude. Zhou asked about the local situation in detail and gave us a map recently made by the office (as shown in Figure 3). By following the map, everything was clear at a glance. It is attached in reduced size for the readers' reference.</p>
<h3>(VIII) Conclusion</h3>
<p>During my one-day visit to Majia Shaokou, I investigated the situation of the Japanese soldiers' intrusion into the interior. What I saw was shocking and filled me with emotion. Summarizing what I saw and heard, there are several things that the readers should pay attention to: (1) The eighteen Chinese li waterway from Majia Shaokou to Kuanghuangtun is leased for five hundred qing, with a lease term of ten years (according to the contract). Such a long waterway, such a wide paddy field, and such a long period of time are truly a major economic endeavor, different from the rice planting of ordinary Koreans in various places. (2) The land on both sides of the eighteen-li-long waterway is all good farmland. I investigated the soil quality, which is loose and easily cracked. When the Yitong River rises, not only will the land along the river be damaged, but also the fields along the trenches will be in danger of collapsing. Because the trenches have no trees and the soil is loose, the banks will inevitably collapse, making it difficult to maintain the current straight length. (3) The July 2nd incident was provoked by Takahashi and guided by Nakagawa. If there had been no threats from Takahashi (according to Xing's remarks), the farmers would not have brought guns. If there had been no shooting by Nakagawa, the farmers would not have retaliated. The responsibility in this is clear, and I ask the people of the country to pay attention. (4) The Japanese soldiers occupy Majia Shaokou as if it were a forbidden area, intruding into civilian houses and acting like occupiers. Their activities have gone beyond the treaty. Therefore, the Wanbaoshan incident has expanded from the economic relationship between Chinese and Korean farmers to the treaty relationship between China and Japan. (5) In recent days, newspapers in various places have reported the removal of Japanese police. This visit proves that as of August 1st, the fact and preparation for the Japanese police to withdraw had not taken place. The Japanese police have been stationed at Majia Shaokou since the eighteenth day of the fourth lunar month (according to Mr. Xing), and as of August 1st of the Gregorian calendar, they have occupied it for more than two months.</p>
<p>I am a teacher of twelve years, and I am ashamed to have made little contribution to the country and society. The Wanbaoshan incident has caused me great concern. Taking advantage of my free time during the summer vacation, I made this trip and recorded what I saw and heard, publishing it to the public. It is nothing more than fulfilling my duty to society as a citizen, without any mission or expectation. This should be stated. (Published on August 4th at Changchun School)</p>

<p>Description:</p>
<p>1. The trench dug from Majia Shaokou to the Jiangjia Wobao farming office is about twenty li long.</p>
<p>2. The trench dug at Majia Shaokou is about three zhang wide and one zhang deep. The earth piled on both sides is about five zhang wide, occupying the people's land about eight zhang wide. The depth, shallowness, width, and narrowness of the trenches are unequal. The occupied people's land, excluding the weeds and old ditches, occupies about forty mu of good farmland.</p>
<p>3. The dam is about four zhang wide and one zhang five cun high, all made of willow branches. The dam is piled up with soil, leaving a place for the water to flow. If the place for the water to flow is filled with soil bags, the river will be cut off, and the water will flow directly into the ditch.</p>
<p>4. The ferry has been stopped, and river transportation is not possible. It is quite difficult to pass through on both sides.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Police Have Officially Withdrawn</h3>
<p>The Koreans also have the intention of leaving</p>
<p>According to news from the Changchun Municipal Office, the Japanese police who shielded the Korean farmers and forcibly dug the dam have been protested by the Municipal Preparatory Office many times and have all been withdrawn. The Japanese Consul Tashi Shigetoku has not followed suit. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially sent a note to the Japanese Ambassador to China on July 22, ordering the Japanese police to withdraw and the Korean farmers to leave. On the 23rd, Special Commissioner Zhong and Japanese Consul-General to Jilin Ishii Jutaro discussed the withdrawal of the Japanese police and further negotiated the case. Ishii telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions, which have been approved and forwarded to the Changchun Japanese Consul Tashi for compliance. On August 2, Special Commissioner Zhong returned to Jilin from Liaoning. On the same day, Tashi went to Jilin to discuss with Ishii the postponement of the withdrawal. The next day, he returned to Changchun but did not comply. With the urging of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Chinese Embassy in Japan, and Special Commissioner Zhong in Jilin, Tashi finally sent Kuraoto Hideaki, the head of the consulate, to officially declare to the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office on August 6 that the police would be withdrawn on the 8th. He also said that he would go there the next day to supervise the complete withdrawal. On the 7th, the Jilin Provincial Government sent Zhang Qingyun to investigate the actual situation, and the Municipal Preparatory Office sent Zhou Wuxiang, He Rongchang, and Wei Ronghou to accompany him to inspect everything. On the 8th, at Chenshi (7-9 AM), they left Changchun. At 6:00 PM, the Municipal Preparatory Office received a telephone call from the office, reporting that a total of 26 Japanese police officers, carrying 26 large guns and one machine gun, lived in He's house at Majia Shaokou and in the military tents along the river. They took eight large carts and were led by Kuraoto Hideaki to withdraw into the city at 1:00 PM. Twelve Koreans followed behind. The remaining twenty or so households, about sixty men, women, and children, in Jiangjia Wobao and Zhang Hongbin's courtyard. Before leaving, Kuraoto told Cao Longbiao, the director of the Third Branch Bureau of Changchun County, that if these Koreans wanted to go elsewhere, they should be allowed to do so. The food in that area was all transported from the city, and the farmers would not sell it to them. The Japanese Consulate in Jilin has repeatedly received letters from anti-Japanese Koreans, ordering the Koreans in Wanbaoshan to quickly withdraw, otherwise there will be a final disposition. The Koreans there had indicated one or two months ago that they would leave immediately after the Japanese police withdrew. It is expected that the Koreans there will all leave soon. The withdrawal of the Japanese police has been telegraphed by the Municipal Office to the Jilin Provincial Government, and Special Commissioner Zhong has telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Negotiations on this case are now underway. (August 8)</p>
<h3>Shi Bu's Cavalry Continues to Arrive in Dezhou</h3>
<p>The Deputy Department will be responsible for tens of thousands of dollars in accommodation fees.</p>
<p>The defeated soldiers will be reorganized into a division after being accommodated.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shi Bu's defeated soldiers continue to retreat to northern Shandong in succession. According to reports from Dezhou, those who have arrived in the past two days are all in small, scattered groups, 30 people, 20 people, or 40 to 50 people. Their uniforms and weapons are incomplete. Yesterday (the 9th), a unit of cavalry also arrived. They are all accommodated by the reception center as soon as they arrive, and then immediately sent to Linyi. At 7:00 PM tonight (the 10th), the reporter visited Fan Pujiang, the representative of Deputy Zhang, and asked about Yan Xishan's arrival in Shanxi and the accommodation of Shi Bu's soldiers. According to him, Yan's return to Shanxi is a confirmed fact. Because Yan's father was ill, he had long planned to return home to visit him. The incident of Shi Yousan's mutiny happened to occur, and he was afraid of misunderstandings, so he did not immediately carry it out. Now that Shi's matter has been resolved, he has returned to Heshui Village to observe the situation. It seems that he has no role to play now, but it is impossible to predict what his future actions will be. Shi Yousan's defeated soldiers continue to arrive in Dezhou in small numbers in recent days. They must wait until they have all arrived before Chairman Han can submit a request to the Central Committee to stipulate the organization. The reception center established in Dezhou accommodates 100 when 100 arrive, and 80 when 80 arrive. It is expected that it will not exceed 10,000 people at most. The accommodation expenses, in addition to the 100,000 yuan undertaken by the Central Government, the Northeast can also undertake tens of thousands of yuan. The Northeast Army has stopped pursuing Shi Bu and will soon issue an order to return to their defense posts. As for Shi Bu, who has been accommodated in the Northeast, in addition to Shen Kequan's division, there are other small parts, the numbers of which are unknown. He will return to Ping tomorrow (the 12th), etc. According to Jiang Bocheng, the chief adviser of the Xingying General Headquarters, about 10,000 of Shi Bu's defeated soldiers have arrived in Shandong, and those who continue to come are only small scattered groups. They can be roughly organized into a division. Chairman Han has followed the orders of the Central Committee and sent Cheng Xixian and Tang Bangzhi to meet with General Commander Cao (Fulin) and Brigade Commander Li (Hanzhang) to be responsible for the compilation.</p>
<h3>The Yellow River is Rising, the Situation is Serious</h3>
<p>Both upstream and downstream telegraphed the province for help</p>
<p>And asked the River Affairs Bureau to allocate materials for emergency rescue</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Continuous torrential rains have caused the Yellow River's water level to continue to rise. Both upstream Li Gong and downstream Tangjia have sent urgent alerts. The River Affairs Bureau has received telegrams from both upstream and downstream, and has reported to the Provincial Government. The telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>Upstream Telegram: To Director Zhang of the Jinan River Affairs Bureau, yesterday (9th) afternoon, there was a torrential rain. The main current of Li Gong directly hit the dams such as 4, 9, and 10. The upper opening collapsed into the water. The protective embankment was completely submerged, only a foot above the water. I have ordered the guards to continue to build it up. The two defenses of the dam, which were previously built and reinforced as needed, are now submerged to the water level again and are still being built up with bricks. The lower corners of the ten dams and four embankments are submerged to the water level. The fifth embankment has been reinforced, and the two unreinforced embankments are again submerged to the water level. The sixth embankment is being reinforced, and the subsidence continues. The eighth embankment shows slight signs of subsidence. The new auxiliary dam base of the dam is submerged to the level of the embankment. The small embankments below the tenth dam have collapsed due to wind and waves and are uneven. I have ordered the nearby villages to send laborers to repair and defend them. In addition to urging the guards to do their best to reinforce the collapsed embankments, I am reporting this by telegram. Furthermore, the materials for Li Gong are now only twenty left. The current of Zhukou has not changed. Zhao Rongfu, Zhang Lufu, and Wang Huaiyi respectfully inform you.</p>
<p>Downstream Telegram: To Director Zhang of the Jinan River Affairs Bureau, the river water has increased by more than five chi. In many sections of this section, the embankments are level with the water, and some are submerged. The highest is less than one or two chi above the water. I have ordered all the guards and local short-term laborers in the whole section to quickly select and reinforce the stored materials such as straw and stones. I have also mobilized more than 200 farmers from nearby along the river to cut willows, transport stones, transport materials, and press down the soil to cooperate in the work to ensure safety. Recently, the materials have been exhausted, and the lower empty defense of the Tangjia East Dam is eight zhang long. The backflow is scouring it, and there is no embankment to protect it, so the bank collapsed three chi wide and eight zhang long, which is extremely dangerous. I have ordered Gao Fenfang, the defense commander, to supervise the farmers to use willow buildings to resist it. However, the engineering is dangerous everywhere. The autumn flood is in full swing, and there are no materials left in the entire section, which is very worrying. I beg you to add more materials such as straw and stones, and actively reinforce them, so as not to be negligent. Zhang Wenqing respectfully informs you.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Provincial Government: (1) To Chairman Han Jun of the Shandong Provincial Government, according to the telegrams from Zhang Lufu, Zhao Rongfu, and Wang Huaiyi of the first section in the south upstream, the continuous rainfall has caused the river water to rise sharply.

The lower corners of the fifth embankment of the dam, the upper corners of the seventh embankment, and the others have been submerged to the water level. The sixth and eighth embankments have subsided by one chi. The two defenses of the dam are still subsiding. We are now throwing soil and bricks, pressing down the engineering, and reinforcing them. We are actively protecting them and so on. In addition to telegraphed that the person to order and other supervised officer to take action force and protect, ensure safety, the actual for public convenience, Acting Shandong River Affairs Bureau Director Zhang Lianjia respectfully informs you.

The Wangzaojia's 1st embankment or high up- the fast running waters and level on some embankments will be underwater etc. - other dams had the current moving against them and were always under the high waters as little as a foot or inches. now it appears the high waters are now rushing to get higher. We used the willow wood to support the the high banks as quick is needed. South four section of Yang ChengLin, Fengjia's second 23rd embankments through 33 embankments etc are only out of water by 8 or 9 inches Wang WangZhuang and other sections etc. some embankments the water is just to the level of the embankments. with the various dangers. Thus, and in another telegram the urgent reports from the officials have been telegraphed and please let us provide relief. acting director Zhang Lian Jia's stamp. (10th Day)</p>
<h3>Post-Flood Relief in Xu-bu</h3>
<p>Road and Telegraph Communications Fully Restored</p>
<p>Seven Refugee Shelters Established</p>
<p>Four Districts Delineated to Defend Against Yellow River Breaches</p>
<p>Quick dispatch from Xuzhou: The situation in Xu-bu on the 7th, with violent storms and rain and the potential for the old Yellow River course to flood the city, was detailed in a previous letter. The weather in this city cleared on the 9th, and the water in the old Yellow River course began to recede. However, along the riverbanks and in flooded areas within the city, many disaster victims were exposed to the elements, a truly pitiful sight. The Flood Relief Association is devising relief measures, which are detailed below. The flood within the city was primarily caused by the heavy rain. By the 9th, with the weather clearing, the water had begun to recede, but the ditches and drains were full, preventing drainage. To this day, some low-lying residences still have one or two feet of standing water, and clearing the ditches has not helped. Many people whose thatched houses collapsed still have no place to go. The water from the old Yellow River course, having breached bridges and roads, was not flowing smoothly downstream. Chen Xueshun, chief of the military and police supervision office, supervised the Seventh Division's engineers stationed in Xuzhou to excavate and facilitate the flow of water. The upstream water volume also decreased. Consequently, on the 9th and 10th, the water level receded by about one foot each day. The city of Xuzhou is now safe. Riverside residents sleeping on the roadsides are a common sight. After its establishment on the 8th, the Flood Relief Committee divided into departments. The county government is responsible for general affairs, the county party branch for relief work, and the office is located at the Property Management Office. As that office is still flooded, they are temporarily operating within the Public Education Center. The general affairs department has four sections: documentation, accounting, general services, and publicity. The relief department has four sections: investigation, fundraising, disaster relief, and reconstruction. Each section handles its respective tasks daily. Starting on the 9th, seven shelters were quickly set up to accommodate women, children, and disaster victims. (1) Zhengxin Girls' Middle School, sheltering women and children. (2) Peixin Middle School, sheltering those with families. (3) Paul Elementary School, sheltering elderly or disabled men. (4) South Gate Jesus Church, sheltering women and children. (5) East Station Jesus Church, sheltering women and children. (6) Xuzhou Civilian Residence, sheltering women and children. (7) Disability Center, sheltering women and children. Each shelter is assigned two managers. The number of disaster victims accommodated is temporarily limited to one thousand, for a period of half a month. Each man and woman receives one pound of steamed buns daily, and each child receives half a pound. The shelters are already overflowing. In addition to food for the people, the association is also working with the Red Swastika Society to sell grain at reasonable prices. The Red Swastika Society has already submitted a request through its Beijing office to the Ministry of Railways, which has approved the allocation of railcars to transport flour, 100 tons at a time, which should arrive in Xuzhou soon. Furthermore, representatives from various organizations, including Zhang Mingli, Liu Tianzhan, Lan Bohua, Li Fengru, Zhu Zhengxue, and Chen Suyi, have been sent to the provincial capital to request disaster relief funds. Regarding local transportation, the telegraph poles that were knocked down have been fully restored. When the water rose rapidly, Director Kuang moved one of the dynamos to a high point outside the city and rented houses in high places for the telegraph workers to ensure continued communication in case the water entered the city. Everything is now fully restored, and the lines are uninterrupted. The railway bridge ends at Liguo Post in North Xuzhou and Haozhai in West Xuzhou were excavated by farmers to release water, and have been repaired. Yesterday, the Longhai Railway bridge in Wayaodian, Xin'an Township, East Xuzhou, also had several sections of its foundation excavated by farmers. Railway personnel were dispatched to repair it, and it should be restored soon. However, to protect against possible breaches in the old Yellow River course, the city's residents are still divided into sections for defense. The entire city and its thirteen towns are divided into four zones to defend against breaches: (1) Hongfu Temple, defended by the towns of Pailou, Fuguozhen, and Tongyizhen. (2) Huisheng Temple, defended by the towns of Fushu, Zhongshan, Zhongshuzhen, and Datongzhen. (3) Outside the city, defended by the towns of Shishikou, Shaohuazhen, and Hepingzhen. (4) Outside the New East Gate, defended by the towns of Wentingzhen, Gongan, and Minshengzhen. (11th)</p>
<h3>Emergency Relief Organized by Jiangsu Provincial Government</h3>
<p>First Batch of Relief Funds: 39,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Distributed to Counties Along the Grand Canal and Those Severely Affected</p>
<p>This year, Jiangsu Province has suffered from prolonged rain, affecting 49 counties. The area north of the Yangtze River along the Grand Canal, located in the lower reaches of the Huai River, has been particularly devastated. Houses have been washed away, and residents are displaced. Although the Gaoyou Chelou Dam, Nanguan Dam, and Xinba Dam were all opened, the water level continues to rise relentlessly. This is truly a disaster unprecedented in decades. The Civil Affairs Department recently dispatched special commissioners to the affected counties to investigate the actual situation. They have been gone for many days. For the most severely affected counties, emergency relief should be promptly organized. Therefore, the department, in conjunction with the Agriculture Department, has drafted standard measures for organizing emergency relief and the allocation of relief funds, which have been submitted to the provincial government for approval. A sum of 39,000 yuan has been allocated for emergency relief. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>Amount of Relief Funds Allocated to Each County: Xinghua (most severe), 5,000 yuan; Liuhe (most severe), 5,000 yuan; Yancheng (severe), 4,000 yuan; Dongtai (severe), 4,000 yuan; Siyang (severe), 4,000</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>yuan; Funing (still severe), 3,000 yuan; Taixian (less severe), 3,000 yuan; Gaoyou (less severe), 3,000 yuan; Tongshan (less severe), 3,000 yuan; Jiangpu (emergency relief), 5,000 yuan. All of the above funds have been claimed by the respective counties.</p>
<p>Standard Measures for Emergency Relief in Each County: (1) The county magistrate, in conjunction with the local relief branch, shall be responsible for organizing emergency relief in each county. (2) A detailed register of the poorest and next poorest households in the disaster area shall be prepared by the county in each district before the distribution of emergency relief. (3) When distributing emergency relief, the county magistrate and relief branch personnel shall personally visit the disaster area to verify and distribute relief according to the register of the poorest households. Relief for the next poorest households shall only be provided if there are surplus funds after relief has been distributed to the poorest households. (4) Three-part receipts shall be prepared for verification purposes during the distribution of emergency relief. The first part is the disaster victim's receipt, the second part is for reporting, and the third part is the stub. The provincial government may request the disaster victim's receipts and stubs from each county for verification if necessary. (5) Emergency relief shall be provided in the following four forms: 1. Distributing cash. 2. Distributing rations. 3. Establishing porridge kitchens. 4. Establishing shelters. (6) After completing emergency relief, each county shall prepare a list of relief funds and grain distributed in each district and township, along with a register of the four forms of relief and the reporting part of the three-part receipts, and submit them to the relevant department for verification.</p>
<h3>Zhalan Coal Mine Budget Approved</h3>
<p>130,000 Rubles Allocated for This Year's Restoration</p>
<p>The Dire State of the CER is Unprecedented</p>
<p>Harbin dispatch: Regarding the restoration of the Zhalainuoer Coal Mine, the board of directors instructed the railway bureau to prepare a budget. The budget was completed last month and submitted to the board. It was approved at an extraordinary meeting of the board of directors on August 5 and will be implemented immediately. A sum of 130,000 gold rubles has been allocated for construction costs this year, with a coal output of 20,000 tons, to be extracted using manual labor and open-pit mining. In subsequent years, the budget will be increased annually, with a maximum expenditure of 500,000 rubles per year. The amount of coal produced will also increase annually until the mine is restored to its original state. It has recently been announced that Hua, the deputy mine manager, has been replaced by Mao Yonggui, chief of the third section of the materials department of the railway bureau, who will soon go to the mine to recruit workers and begin mining. According to the Russian mine manager's suggestion, this year's mining will involve two steps: one, using new machinery to pump out the water near the mining area; and two, laying railway tracks in the mining area. These two tasks cannot be carried out simultaneously and must be separated by half a month. Therefore, the earliest date for coal production will be in late October. The business situation of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) has been gradually declining. The board of directors has reviewed the entire railway budget three times. After repeated reductions, it was finally finalized the other day, with expenditures estimated at 26 million gold rubles and revenues at 37.5 million gold rubles. However, the Russian side argued that the revenue estimate should be set at 32 million rubles, while the Chinese side argued that it could reach 37.5 million. Therefore, although this item has been approved by the board of directors, it still needs to be decided after Mordehui sends a telegram. Of the 37.5 million yuan in revenue, in addition to railway expenses, the following amounts are allocated to various agencies: (1) 132,000 rubles for the Superintendent's Office for the year; (2) 1.3 million rubles for the Railway Police Department for the year; (3) 600,000 Harbin dollars for the Governor's Office for the year; (4) 100,000 rubles for the Special District Court for the year; (5) 360,000 rubles for the Special Police Department for the year; (6) 200,000 rubles for the Railway Protection Army for the year; (7) 950,000 rubles for the Special Education Department; and 50,000 rubles for general expenses. If we add the losses from the exchange rate between rubles and Harbin dollars, the revenue is 40 million less than in 1925, the CER's most prosperous era. Expenditures have been reduced by 25 million. On August 1, the railway bureau decided on a new budget and announced the layoff of 317 employees, including more than 150 workers. The 36-shed railway sawmill had to be closed. The express passenger trains running between Harbin, Changchun, and Suifenhe have also been suspended. Since the first of this month, the Europe-Asia through train can no longer reach Harbin directly. This dire situation is unprecedented in the history of the CER. (8th)</p>
<h3>Quick Dispatch from Wuhu</h3>
<p>Continuous hurricanes have swept through here for three days non-stop. The floodwaters, stirred up by the wind, have posed an immense threat to the dikes which have miraculously remained intact. The Wanchun Dike, protecting the most fertile fields near Wuhu covering a total of one hundred thousand mu, was nearly breached the night before last. Fortunately, more than ten thousand workers managed to save it from disaster. However, many farmers have been forced to harvest their unripe rice, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<p>The Wuhu Flood Relief Association held a meeting today. Due to the high number of deaths among the disaster victims and the outbreak of epidemics, the association has established several Chinese and Western medical clinics in the city and countryside. In addition, organizations such as the Red Cross, Red Swastika Society, and Jisheng Hall have jointly formed burial teams.</p>
<p>Wang Leshan, brigade commander of the 171st Brigade of the 57th Division stationed in Wuhu, has noted that since the floods, bandits and disaster victims have been causing considerable disturbance in all directions, making local defense crucial. In addition to enforcing martial law and stationing troops at the electricity company and telephone bureau, Wang Leshan convened a public security meeting at the Red Swastika Society yesterday. The county magistrate, public security bureau chief, and chamber of commerce chairman were all in attendance. They decided on several measures to maintain local security and assigned responsibilities.</p>
<p>The bandit gangs in Liu'an, Anhui, have not yet been suppressed. Provincial Chairman Chen Diaoyuan had planned to travel from Anqing to Jiangxi today to meet with Chairman Chiang, intending to request that troops from Henan be dispatched to encircle and annihilate them. However, recent reports indicate a large number of bandit gangs in the Yingshan and Huoqiu areas. Chiang has ordered troops to be deployed to suppress them, so Chen has postponed his trip to Jiangxi.</p>
<p>The County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee has accused Zhu Dian, a gentry member from Wuhu, of local tyranny and has requested the county government to arrest him. Branch offices in various districts have also posted slogans demanding Zhu's execution for his disregard for the party and exploitation of farmers. (12th)</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Aircraft Crashes and Is Dismantled and Carried Away: Yesterday, an aircraft crashed in Xinqiao in the third district due to damaged parts. Farmers surrounded the aircraft and demanded compensation for the damaged crops. The issue was not immediately resolved. The pilot, with the aircraft protected by police dispatched from the branch office, felt safe and returned to Shanghai. The aircraft belongs to the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Today (13th), the pilot returned to Xinqiao and dismantled the aircraft, carrying the parts away. Regarding the farmers' demand for compensation, it is reported that they will be given 30 yuan as a gesture of goodwill.</p>
<p>High Court Sends Personnel to Investigate Prison: Due to the case of the death of prisoner Xu Qisheng by poisoning while in prison during the tenure of Zheng Ligeng, the former prison warden, the High Court has sent Yao Guozhang, director of the prison department, to Songjiang on the 12th to investigate. He is also tasked with facilitating the construction of a new prison and improving the living conditions of the prisoners.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Robbery with Injury in Xuzhuang Township: Yesterday (13th) at approximately 1:00 AM, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived at the home of Xu Ren'an, a farmer in Xuzhuang Township, Suzhou, in a boat. They broke down the door and entered, arbitrarily searching the house. They robbed silver dollars and clothing, as well as 15 shi of rice. As they left, they shot and injured Xu Ren'an and two others. The victim has reported the incident and requested a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Dike Collapse in Hengjing Township Sweeps Away Farmers: Hengjing Township in Wuxian County, bordering Taihu Lake, is the lowest-lying area in the entire county. During this flood, eight out of ten parts of the fields in the township suffered total crop failure. Currently, the farmers in various villages are working hard to bail out water. However, the dike near Ducun Village in the township suddenly collapsed for more than ten zhang the other day. The water rushed in torrents, destroying many farmhouses. More than ten farmers were swept away by the waves and their whereabouts are unknown. In addition to ordering the farmers to work hard to repair the dike, the township office and public security bureau have reported the matter to the county government for instructions.</p>
<p>Change of President at Local Court: Ting Yaoting, president of the Wuxian County Local Court, has been ordered to be transferred to the Jiangning County Local Court as President. His vacant position will be filled by a Mr. Qu. Zhu is scheduled to depart for Nanjing on the 17th to take up his new post.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Wife and Concubine Lawsuit Incites Public Outrage: The death of Yu Ziming, a wealthy resident of Yangshuyuan in the 16th district of Xiyi, has sparked a lawsuit between his wife and concubine, which has not yet been resolved. It is reported that 34 people, including Yu Linzhang, Han Chu, and Zhang Boming, are outraged by this. Yesterday, they jointly filed a petition with the Wuxi County Court Procuratorate, stating that Yu's wife, Bian, has had an affair with Kuang Yunda for over a year, and that Kuang openly resides in her house. Everyone in the village knows about this. Yu's son, Yigen, has been ill for more than two years (suffering from a mild form of tuberculosis) and lives with his mother in Kuang's house, not returning to the Yu family. Everyone in the village knows this. On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, Bian returned home, and Xiao Yu Hu (Wen Zai's wife) asked her why Wen was not returning. Bian replied that he was doing well in the city. Seeing her strange expression, as if she was happy, Xiao Yu Hu said that since he was in litigation, the payment for the association fee was due, and asked her to pay it on his behalf. Upon hearing this, Bian raised her hand and slapped her face and went inside to get something, intending to leave. Da Yu Hu stopped her, causing a conflict between the two. Neighbors persuaded them to stop. Later, the village chief Qian Nianxiang went to a teahouse in the town to mediate the matter. As a result, both parties agreed not to press charges. At that time, none of them mentioned any poison. Later, Bian suddenly went back on her word and went to the city to press charges. Then, both Da Yu Hu and Xiao Yu Hu also went to the city to press charges. Bian suddenly presented longan pulp in court, claiming that it contained poison and that Da Yu Hu intended to poison her son Yigen. However, there are two points to this: 1. Yigen lives in Kuang's house and has not returned. 2. The village chief did not mention any poison during mediation. Moreover, Da Yu Hu's mother, Liu Yu, went to relatives' houses to attend a social gathering, and Wen Zai's concubine, Yu Hui, who is pregnant and about to give birth, lives separately two li away in Ge Lane. Bian's claims that they were all accomplices are clearly false accusations. Therefore, the villagers are presenting this public letter out of righteous indignation. They are all willing to testify in court.</p>
<p>Three Murders in One Day: Yesterday, there were three murder cases in one day. (1) At the home of Zhu A'gen, a villager in Xiadianqiao, 594, Jingyun City in the second district, Wang Wenkui, a Jingjiang native and cooper by trade, aged over fifty, hanged himself at 8:00 AM due to increasing living costs and severe financial difficulties. The chief of the county office reported the incident to the county court for an autopsy. (2) The County Court Procuratorate reported yesterday that it had received a report from Mao Jinji, chief of 17, that an unidentified male corpse had been found under the Huinong Bridge. Upon receiving the report, the Procuratorate sent Procurator Du and Shen, the coroner, to conduct an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that the corpse was about thirty years old, with a laceration on the left forehead. It appeared that the body had been moved. The chief was ordered to prepare a coffin and collect the body, pending further investigation. (3) Yesterday, while the Xiyi Yangxian steamship of the Gongyun Bridge Xi Yi Company was returning to Wuxi from Yi, it met the Xueyi ship on the way. A passenger on the Xue ship fell seriously ill. So, Fai Peichuan, the captain, talked to Wang Tingda, the tugboat owner of Yangxian, and transfered the sick passenger to the ship for treatment in Wuxi. Unexpectedly, when the ship arrived at the company's dock, the passenger had already died and could not be rescued. Yesterday the prosecutor's office was notified to inspect the body and prepare a coffin.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>City's Rice Reserves Only Sufficient for One Month: Rice prices in this city are increasing daily. Although the Rice Industry Association has resolved that the price of Gaobai Tang rice should not exceed 15 yuan per shi, some are still selling it for 15.60 yuan. According to the Rice Industry Association's investigation, there are approximately 600,000 to 700,000 shi of rice in storage in this city, which can be milled into approximately 300,000 shi. The entire city consumes more than 1,000 shi of rice per day, which is only enough for one month. Furthermore, Anhui rice is banned from export, which will cut off the source of supply. The rice merchants have sent representatives to Shanghai to order a large quantity of foreign rice to be transported to Zhenjiang for supply.</p>
<p>Riverbank Collapse in Huangni Township: Due to rising tides, the riverbank in Huangni Township, Yonggu district of the first district, suddenly collapsed for more than twenty zhang the other day. All the dikes have become a watery expanse. Although no lives have been lost, the number of disaster victims is large. The river water east of Xiaoyi is now level with the riverbank, which is very dangerous. If it collapses again, thousands of households in the entire township will not escape disaster.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Dredging Coastal Harbor Rivers: The harbor rivers such as Yaowang have become silted up. The eastern area had a big flood this year, which did not drain well. The county government is constructing a bureau to implement construction, resolving to dredge the port to provide work relief.</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Committee Reorganizing Warehouses: Shi Shuzhi, a member of the Civil Affairs Department, has been sent to Tongzhou to reorganize warehouses. The warehouses are currently being used by Tongzhong Shixiao, which will be negotiated to be recovered.</p>
<p>Investigating Theft of Jiang An Chart: The Jiang'an chart measured by the Nantong Baotu Association is stored in the Construction Bureau. The chart was stolen by the servant of former bureau director Yao Pengnian last November and sold to Shun Sheng Roasted Goods Shop near the Construction Bureau for 160 wen per catty. It has been recently discovered that many of the charts have been used as waste paper. The shopkeeper Wang Jinyu has been arrested by the Public Security Bureau, and the Construction Bureau has asked the court to investigate the matter.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Soar Due to Shortages: The county has been affected by flooding, and there is also a shortage of supplies. Anhui rice, which was supposed to be available soon, has not arrived because the province has been severely affected by flooding. Rice prices have been soaring for days. White japonica rice has already reached 14 yuan and is expected to continue to rise. The Food Management Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 12th to discuss relief measures.</p>
<p>Education Bureau Requests Payment of 200,000 in Delinquent Treasury Bonds: The county government held a county political meeting on the 8th, presided over by County Magistrate Peng. He reported that Changshu Shazhou farmers had occupied the dry river in Fushou Township in the seventh district. He has sent a telegram to the county government to arrange a joint survey. The response telegram has been received, and officials from the Construction Bureau have been dispatched to conduct a survey. This government has dispatched Committee Member Xu Peidan to the countryside. He then discussed the Education Bureau's proposal to clear the outstanding treasury bonds, requesting the issuance of 200,000 yuan to comply with the original proposal. It was resolved that the proposal be approved, but 58,540 yuan from the Education Bureau's unpaid education expenses should be allocated to the Treasury Bond Fund Management Committee as collateral.</p>
<p>Zhang Chongzhi Reclaims House: Zhang Lin, Sha Zhixian, Zhang Chongzhi, Zhu Zhenyang, Shi Da, Wu Baolian, and others, the defendants in the Zhou Shuiping case, paid money to the provincial government to close the case and revoked the detention of property. After the disposition, the house of Zhang Chongzhi is being used by the County Party Headquarters. Zhang Chongzhi has submitted a request to the county to reclaim the house for living purposes. Yesterday (11th), Wang Shusheng of the County Party Headquarters spoke to the county government. Regarding the house issue, it can only be returned after a suitable address is found.</p>
<p>Difficult to Resolve Dam Opening: Due to the Changshu San'gan River dam blockage, the Sha people of Yangku Fushou Township in the seventh district have had their fields flooded and have requested the opening of the dam. After the county sent a telegram to the Changshu county government, it dispatched Construction Bureau Committee Member He and Jiangyin County Government Section Member Xu Peidan to conduct an inspection. The Sha people unanimously requested the opening of the dam, but the Changshu Sha people firmly refused. The situation has become a stalemate and there is still no solution. This matter needs to be handled by the superiors. Section Member Xu returned to the city to report on the evening of the 11th.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Two Feet of Water Expected from Canal: The canal water level in this county has been gradually rising recently as water from the Yi River has arrived. Today (10th), the water level at the Imperial Wharf has reached 1 zhang 9 chi 3 cun and a half. According to canal officials, the Yi River suddenly rose 6 chi 5 cun on the 4th of this month, another 6 chi on the 5th, and another 5 chi on the 6th. In three days, the water rose 1 zhang 7 chi 5 cun, which should translate to a rise of more than 2 chi in the canal. The provincial government has received the telegram and has dispatched Sun Hongzhe, director of the Construction Department, to the post with 30,000 yuan. The funds will be handed to the Water Conservancy Bureau to quickly hire 1,000 workers to build canal embankments to prevent any unforeseen events. Director Sun is currently visiting Bao Ying, Huai'an, Huaiyin and other counties to inspect the dikes and water levels. The provincial government has also appointed He Haiqiao to visit the post to inspect the floods. It is reported that He will soon accompany County Magistrate Wang and Jiang Zhiqing of the Party Supervision Committee to Xinghua to inspect the disaster situation to facilitate relief efforts.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Call to Protect Zhaoguan Dam: Recently, people up and down the river have been sending letters and telegrams on the issue of opening the Zhaoguan Dam, arguing for and against it. Li Mingyang, director of the Provincial Security Bureau, arrived in Yangzhou by special boat early on the 12th with Pei, chief engineer of the Water Conservancy Bureau, to inspect the water situation in northern Jiangsu and to inspect the possibility of opening the Zhaoguan Dam. The province also took the issue of Zhaoguan very seriously. The counties downstream such as Lvjiang and Jiangdu have sent multiple telegrams requesting the province to protect the dam. The general idea is that to open the dam and release water, the dike fields of the various salt reclamation companies should be sacrificed first to dredge the waterways. Otherwise, it will be difficult to open Zhaoguan. The water will stagnate downstream and will not be able to return to the sea, which will be harmful and not helpful. Yesterday (11th), the Shaobo Chamber of Commerce and Farmers' Association and the public sent a telegram to the Governor-General stating that the water volume in the counties east of the Shaobo Dike had exceeded 10 records, and the entire area was flooded. The disaster of the flooded tombs was severe. If the Zhaoguan Dam is opened again, it will put millions of lives in the counties down the river to death. They implore the Governor-General to order the protection of lives, so that the work of creation will be deep.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu, Where Riverbanks and Dikes are Simultaneously in Danger: This year's flood covers a wide area, and the Huai River basin is the most severely affected. The upper and lower reaches of the canal, four hundred or more li in length, are a vast expanse of water, which is very tragic. Due to the recent torrential rains in the Yi River, the water in the upper reaches of the canal has increased sharply, and the southeasterly wind has intensified, causing the tides to rush inland, putting the downstream areas in even greater danger than before the opening of the Chelou Dam, Nanguan Dam, and Xinba Dam. The riverbanks around Guazhou are also very dangerous. As of the evening of the 10th, two dikes had collapsed in Guazhou. Trees were being cut down day and night, and windows and walls were being dismantled to fill the dikes. (Guazhou and Shaobo are both in Jiangdu, Guazhou is south of the county seat, and Shaobo is north of the county seat.) On the 10th and 11th, due to the strong winds, the river tides and lake water (the west bank of Shaobo is Shaobo Lake) advanced fiercely at the same time, so that the dikes of the town were at a critical point. The Jiangdu Construction Bureau, under the order of the county magistrate, purchased 400 dan of Jiang firewood and transported it to the area this morning (12th) to raise the riverbanks to alleviate the immediate crisis.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Northkan Changsha Pirates Active Again: Zhou Fuyu and other fishermen from Northkan, Juegang, witnessed five or six pirate ships chasing fishing boats in the Huangsha waters the other day.

The fishermen are crying out in pain as they open their mouths to the police. More than ten pirate ships have also been discovered near Changsha recently. They are demanding food and salaries from the residents along the coast. It was reported on the evening of the 5th that they had burned three fishing boats. Their momentum is very rampant.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Rise Sharply by More Than Two Yuan: Rice prices have recently risen sharply, from 12 yuan to more than 14 yuan per stone. It is said that there are few sources, and there is no hope for autumn harvests in the low-lying fields. It is expected that rice prices will continue to rise in the future.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Arrest Warrant for Escaped Vagrants: The Jiaxing Vagrant Skills Training Center had eleven vagrants escape on the evening of the 8th at around 9 pm.

Yesterday, the county government publicly announced the names, ages, and origins of those who escaped, and issued orders to the land and water military and police agencies to conduct a coordinated search.</p>
<p>Joint Trial of Bandits: After the looting in Puyuan Town, Jiaxing, many of the bandits have been apprehended and are being investigated according to the law. It is now known that detectives from the Third District of Jiangsu Water Police have also apprehended three bandits involved in the case, Liu Hesheng, Zhang Xueshun, and Wang Desan, in Shanghai. They were escorted to the Water Police District Headquarters, where, on the 12th, a joint trial was held by Zhou Weilie, the District Chief of the Water Police, Gong Shinong, the County Chief of Jiaxing, and Yang Xiuyan, the County Chief of Tongxiang. The suspect Zhang confessed that there were six boats involved in the looting of Puyuan, and Liu was a minor leader, with three boats under his command. However, despite rigorous interrogation, Liu and Wang have not revealed the truth. After the trial, the three suspects were taken back to Tongxiang by County Chief Yang for detention, and a telegram was sent to the provincial authorities for further instructions.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Execution of Mutinous Soldiers: The mutinous soldiers of the 16th Company, 4th Battalion, 7th Regiment of the Provincial Security Force, formerly stationed in Xincang, looted Xincang and Zhapu.

After approval from the Provincial Government, they were escorted to the scene of the incident for execution. Yesterday, the 7th Regiment Commander, Shen Guocheng, led a platoon of soldiers under the command of the Special Service Company Commander, Chen Tianjing, escorted them to Pinghu on the Jiahe shift, and then transferred them to Xincang, where they were tied up at the Zhujia Alley execution ground and executed by firing squad one by one.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Kidnappers Confess to Detective Receiving Huge Bribe: The mother of Zhang Jiaxian, a resident of Changxiang, East Township, Xiaoshan, was kidnapped by bandits last year, demanding a ransom of 20,000 yuan. The family scraped together 19,500 yuan and entrusted Shen Baosheng, a fellow villager, to negotiate in Shanghai. Shen took advantage of the situation, resulting in insufficient ransom and the victim being killed. Upon learning of this, Zhang was overwhelmed with grief. Qian Asong, a bandit, has been captured by detective Chen Xijiu and sent to the Local Pacification Bureau for investigation. During yesterday's court interrogation, he confessed that Feng Binggang, the former detective captain, received a bribe of 300 yuan, and Shen Baosheng received 200 yuan. Arrest warrants have been issued for both of them, and they will be brought to justice for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Crackdown on Uncapitalized and Bogus Businesses: A man named Qiu Jichang in Doumen Town, Shaoxing, established a fake rice shop, Qiu Xiansheng Changji, without any capital, defrauding upstream suppliers of goods worth over 5,000 yuan, which he then sold and embezzled. After the creditor group obtained evidence, they filed civil and criminal lawsuits to investigate and prosecute him according to the law. They also posted a notice requesting the grain and rice trade association to forward a letter to the county chamber of commerce, urging them to take strict measures to crack down on uncapitalized and bogus businesses, maintain commercial ethics, and prevent small businesses from suffering endless harm.</p>
<h3>Changxing</h3>
<p>Lakeside Floods Await Urgent Relief: The northeast townships under the jurisdiction of Heping in Changxing, including Chengjing Village, which borders Wuxing, have approximately 2,000 households and about 42,000 mu of farmland. Since July 20th of the lunar calendar, there has been torrential rain for seven days and nights. On the 27th and 28th, violent storms and torrential rains added to the disaster, causing widespread flooding and cries of distress. All farming tools were swept away by the floodwaters, and houses and huts were completely washed away. The accumulated water has not yet receded, and people are living outdoors, exposed to the elements, without rice to cook, suffering from a severe calamity beyond words. They are now appealing to the authorities, hoping for urgent assistance.</p>

<p>To be Held in Ningbo on September 1st</p>
<p>The Chinese Economic Society will hold its eighth annual conference in Ningbo this year. Because the Ningbo members of the society all work in Shanghai, the preparation has to be entrusted to local officials and gentry. Therefore, the president of the society, Ma Yinchu, went to Ningbo in mid-June to visit various sectors of the Ningbo Party, government, business, and academic communities, to discuss all the arrangements in person, which was warmly supported by all sectors. Consequently, a preparatory committee was organized, consisting of members of the society and local figures from the Party, government, business, and academic circles. Chen Baolin, the county chief of Yin County, was appointed as the vice chairman, responsible for carrying out the preparatory work. The conference is scheduled to be held from September 1st to September 6th. The venue will be in the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, which has high buildings and a spacious hall, suitable for gatherings. The society has invited Cai Yuanpei to give a keynote speech, and has also accepted invitations from local groups to send members of the society to give lectures in various fields.

As of today, there are more than 500 members of the society, and about 100 people are expected to attend. After the meeting, it is planned to visit famous scenic spots such as Putuo, Fenghua Xuedou, and Tiantong Yuwang. The preparatory committee has negotiated preferential arrangements with the Sanbei Ning Shao Merchants and Sanbei Company. Members attending the meeting who travel to Ningbo by sea can collect vouchers from Li Gufan at Yuehua Middle Business Company, No. 36 Edward Road, Shanghai, before the 26th of this month. With this voucher, they can exchange for half-price tickets from the company, applicable to both the deluxe and standard cabins.

The guidebook for the eighth annual conference of the society has been printed by the preparatory committee and distributed to the members. According to the schedule, members need to stay overnight in Tiantong and Putuo. If they are concerned about the cleanliness of the bedding in the temples, it is best to bring one or two sheets. It is reported that the cost of the conference is calculated based on 100 people. The ships, sedan chairs, and hotel rooms for visiting scenic spots must be prepared in advance by the preparatory committee. Therefore, members attending the meeting must notify Chen Baolin of the Yin County Government a few days before the meeting so that he can prepare everything on their behalf.</p>

<p>Chinese Student Tennis Doubles Final</p>
<h3>Qian and Guo Win the Championship</h3>
<p>Defeating Yu Tianguang and Feng Nianci 3 to 1</p>
<p>1-6, 6-3, 8-6, 6-4 丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Student Tennis Doubles Final was held at the Chinese Tennis Court at 5 PM yesterday. Qian Yaobin and Guo Yujie won the championship by defeating Yu Tianguang and Feng Nianci 1-6, 6-3, 8-6, 6-4. Qian and Guo are both rising stars. Qian's forehand and backhand strokes and overhead smashes all show skill, and Guo's net play also made many contributions. Yu Tianguang was the champion of the Shanghai Group B tournament last year, and his tennis skills have long been well-known. However, he was not in good spirits yesterday and lacked strength. In addition, Feng Nianci's tennis skills were relatively poor, and the two could not cooperate, which led to their defeat.</p>
<p>Qian Yaobin and Guo Yujie (1丨6 6丨3 8丨6 6丨4) Yu Tianguang and Feng Nianci</p>
<h3>Amazing Start</h3>
<p>After the start, Yu and Feng were quite successful, winning the first game with a score of 6-1. Qian and Guo tried their best to struggle, but because they lost too much, it was difficult to recover. Yu and Feng won with a score of 6 to 1.</p>
<h3>Taking Advantage of the Opportunity</h3>
<p>Starting from the second set, Qian's group took the advantage, and the weaknesses of Yu's group were exposed. One was careless, and the other could not connect, so that the enemy could easily advance. Although they formed a situation of 3 to 2, they were eventually defeated by Qian and Guo with a score of 6 to 3.</p>
<h3>Almost Succeeded</h3>
<p>In the third set, the situation was the most even. Yu and Feng had many opportunities to win, and they had an advantage of 6 to 5. In the next game, Yu's group took the lead with a score of 3 to 2. If they could win another game, they could win back this set.

<p>Letter to the Editor Mr. Reporter, I am writing to you. Yesterday, I bought and read your newspaper on the Beijing-Shanghai train.

I would like to request a correction. Sincerely, Wang Maozu, August 11.</p>

<h3>Robbing Inspectors</h3>
<p>Japanese Goods Seized at Huatong Wharf</p>
<p>Taken Away by Japanese Soldiers Midway</p>
<p>It Is Agreed to Use Armed Escorts in the Future</p>
<p>Since the Anti-Japanese Association sent personnel to inspect Japanese goods at various wharf, smuggling of Japanese goods has often been seized. The night before last (i.e. the 12th), the inspectors again seized a large batch of Japanese cloth and cotton yarn at the Huatong Wharf in Pudong, which was shipped from Niuzhuang. The inspectors detained all the goods, but the Japanese ordered Japanese soldiers to seize them by force and rob four inspectors, who were beaten and humiliated by the Japanese along the way. This matter has now been protested by our side. The detailed information of this matter is truthfully reported as follows:</p>
<p>First Smuggling Seizure On the 4th of this month, Japanese merchants such as Jiangshang Ito in Shanghai each had a large batch of Oriental cloth and cotton yarn, a total of 360 pieces, and entrusted the Japanese transportation company International Association to declare them to Niuzhuang. Because no Japanese ships were sailing on this route, they were transferred to Taikoo Company's Daming Wheel. However, when Daming returned the goods due to too many cargoes, it was changed to De'an Wheel for transportation. During the transfer to the ship, the Anti-Japanese Association learned about it and urgently sent an inspection team to the port to inspect it. The batch of 360 pieces of cloth and yarn, worth more than 70,000 taels of silver, were detained and taken to Lujiazui. When the Japanese merchants learned about it, they wanted to recover it. At that time, the Japanese goods had already been put into the warehouse. The Japanese consulate raised this matter with our side, but it has not been resolved yet. The second batch of Japanese goods continued to be loaded and was seized again.</p>
<p>Second Seizure of Japanese Goods On the 12th, the Oriental Cotton Yarn Association in Shanghai had 171 pieces of cloth and yarn, worth 33,185 taels of silver, which were also destined for Yingkou. It was also entrusted to the International Transportation Association to declare them. They were loaded onto Taikoo Company's Lin'an Wheel to Niuzhuang. This batch of goods was loaded onto a barge by a small steamer to Huatong Wharf in Pudong at 7:00 PM on the 12th. It did not start until about 9:00 PM to load into the Lin'an ship. After two hours, more than 90 pieces had been loaded, and about 80 pieces were still being loaded. When the inspection team of the Anti-Japanese Association arrived at the port by small steamer, after discovering these Japanese goods, they ordered the coolies to stop loading. At the same time, they ordered the receiver on the Lin'an ship to unload the more than 90 pieces that had already entered the cabin and put them back on the original barge. Then the inspectors detained all the goods and used this wheel to tow them to Lujiazui to report to the association for verification.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Send Soldiers to Seize Goods This time the Japanese merchants transferred these goods. Dongmian transferred Konemoto Seitaro and International sent Hayashida to the dock to supervise the loading of the goods. When the inspectors detained the goods, both Japanese were not present. It was not until after 10:00 that the goods had been taken away by the inspection team when the Japanese Hayashida arrived and saw this situation. He immediately rushed to the Japanese Marine Corps in Yuanhai and requested to send troops to protect them. The Japanese naval commander informed the Ataka warship stationed in the Huangpu River and sent 25 fully armed Japanese marines, accompanied by Hayashida, to Pudong. They immediately took the Zuifeng Maru small wheel and chased after them. The inspection team's small wheel was slow because it was dragging a heavy cargo barge, so it had just arrived at Lujiazui and was about to enter the port when the Japanese soldiers arrived, seized the original goods and barge, and towed them away by the Zuifeng Maru small wheel.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Rob and Plunder Inspectors When the Japanese soldiers chased to the inspection team's small steamer, they jumped into the boat with weapons. On the one hand, they seized the cargo barge, and on the other hand, they used guns to beat the inspectors on the boat. Most of our inspectors were unarmed, how could they resist the fully armed Japanese soldiers? Moreover, the Japanese soldiers were determined to seek a reward and beat anyone they saw. The inspectors rushed ashore to take temporary shelter. Song Zhiwen, Gao Shanlin, Wang Ajin, Wang Meifa, and others were caught by the Japanese soldiers, dragged onto the Japanese's Zuifeng Maru small wheel, and kidnapped away. After boarding the wheel, the Japanese soldiers beat the four people with their gun butts, first押 them to the Ataka warship, and then the Japanese soldiers transferred them to the Japanese Consulate by warship small wheel.</p>
<p>Negotiations by the Public Security Bureau After this incident occurred, the Anti-Japanese Association has reported to the Municipal Government. Yesterday noon, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau has sent personnel to the Japanese Consulate to negotiate the release of the inspectors Song Gao Wang Wang, who were kidnapped and押 by the Japanese soldiers. It is heard that the inspectors have been領 back yesterday noon and will file another negotiation.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Meet to Discuss Loading Goods Yesterday, the Japanese merchants in Shanghai went to the Japanese Consulate to hold a meeting to discuss the transportation methods of Japanese goods in the future. As a result of the discussion, the Japanese believed that it was most appropriate to use force to deal with the Anti-Japanese Association's inspection of goods. The Japanese merchants cited the success of the Japanese soldiers recovering 20麻袋s in Suzhou River and the success of recovering more than 170 pieces of cloth and yarn this time. In the future, the loading and transportation of Japanese goods will be protected by armed navy. If there is any inspection and detention of goods, the Japanese soldiers will be allowed to act freely. It is heard that the Japanese Consul and the Naval Authorities have all tacitly agreed, so yesterday, all the Japanese merchants were full of ambition and expressed that they were not afraid of anti-Japanese sentiment and that the transportation of goods would become an open loading. This move is closely related to the future of our anti-Japanese sentiment.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Committee To the compatriots across the country, unfortunately, our country has been repeatedly invaded by foreign enemies. The Japanese imperialists have not only seized our fields and occupied our land in Wanbaoshan, killed our farmers, and insulted our officials, but also instigated rioters in Korea to massacre our overseas Chinese. In just ten days, more than 1,000 people have died, thousands have been injured, and property worth tens of millions of yuan has been lost. However, the Japanese imperialists have no remorse. The Japanese warships stationed in Shanghai have repeatedly sent armed navy to invade the Chinese boundary, rob goods, and arrest compatriots, and beat and injure the staff of this association. Their treacherous intentions, tyrannical behavior, and despicable tactics are truly unbearable for us. Now, the facts of the incident are reported to the people of the country for your consideration. At 5:00 AM on the 11th of this month, the Zhabei Inspection Office of this association received a report that a奸商 had purchased 7,500 Japanese麻袋s and was trying to smuggle them out of the country on Suzhou Road. The Inspection Office immediately sent personnel to intercept them. At 8:00 AM, a person claiming to be Japanese came forward to interfere and requested their return. The Inspection Office had no right to return them and immediately accompanied the Japanese to this association to request that the association return the goods if they were purchased by the Japanese after verification. Personnel were immediately sent to the dock to verify them as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, the staff of this association had just arrived at the dock when the detained麻袋s were forcibly robbed by armed soldiers. According to eyewitnesses at the time, at 12:00 noon that morning, more than 30 Japanese soldiers suddenly came, fully armed, as if facing a major enemy. The muzzles of their guns were aimed at the inspection boat, forbidding the guards from speaking. At the same time, more than 10 Japanese soldiers carried the麻袋s into a small steamer and roared away. The day after this incident occurred, the Pudong Inspection Office of this association discovered that a奸商 had purchased Japanese yarn and was transporting it to other ports, so it immediately sent personnel to detain it in the Huangpu River and hired another small wheel to tow it back to Pudong. When it reached the Jiang'an shore, there was a Japanese ship full of Japanese soldiers lying in ambush, who completely robbed the yarn and abducted our inspectors Song Zhiwen, Gao Shanlin, Wang Meifa, Wang Ajin, and four others. One person's whereabouts are unknown, and his life or death is uncertain. At about 2:00 AM that night, this association received a report and immediately sent cadres to the Public Security Bureau to negotiate. After several twists and turns, the Japanese Consulate sent the four abducted persons back to this association at 12:00 noon. As for the missing person, there is still no news of him, and his life or death is uncertain. The four released persons were either kicked by leather shoes or beaten by gun butts, so that their arms, legs, waists, and backs were all covered in blood stains and scars. Looking at them, we could not help but sob. The colleagues of this association, in the face of national crisis, are entrusted with heavy responsibilities by all sectors of society. They are willing to go through fire and water, and they will have no regrets even if they die. They only think that China is the China of 400 million people, and saving the country is a public matter of 400 million people. Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world. The colleagues of this association should go forward bravely and take the lead. All sectors of the country should also rise up and stand up, and our high-ranking party and government organs, who usually lead the people and devote themselves to the revolution of the Three Principles of the People, should also share the same hatred and be pioneers for the people. Today, the Japanese imperialists have seized our national land, killed our overseas Chinese, and the Japanese warships stationed in Shanghai have sent large teams of Japanese soldiers to invade the Chinese boundary, kidnap people, and rob goods. If this is not done, what is not done? If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? The five-minute enthusiasm is very shameful, but if even this five-minute enthusiasm does not exist, will it not be even more shameful? Alas, it is better to die without freedom. Now, fight for freedom or die. Do not fight or die. Is there still a place for our Chinese people who are willing to give up on themselves in the beautiful rivers and mountains of 40,000 square miles? Why do the people of the country still cling to this dream of being a slave of all nations and not be the vanguard of the times?

<h3>Soong Ching Ling Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Going Directly to the Soong Residence on Seymour Road to Mourn</p>
<p>Deciding on Future Actions After the Funeral</p>
<p>Madame Soong Ching Ling, accompanied by her secretary Ms. Hu Lanqi, returned to China from Berlin to mourn her mother. She arrived at the port on the Dalian Maru at 6:20 PM yesterday. She landed at the Huangpu Wharf and took a car directly to the Soong residence on Seymour Road to rest. Those who came to Shanghai on the same wheel as Madame Sun included Zhou Xiangxian, the secretary of the General Headquarters sent by Chairman Chiang to Liaoning to welcome her, and Shi Xiaofeng of the Lizi Society, a total of four people.</p>
<p>Welcome at the Wharf Those who went to the Huangpu Wharf to welcome her yesterday included the newly appointed Ambassador to Japan Chiang Tso-pin, Mayor Zhang Qun, Vice Minister of Industry Zheng Hongnian, President of Jiaotong University Li Zhaohuan, Superintendent of Jianghai Customs Tang Hai'an, Madame Lian Shenghai, wife of the Vice Minister of Railways, Soong Tzu-liang, and the two daughters of Kung Hsiang-hsi, and dozens of others. Jiang Yi, the deputy officer of the Garrison Headquarters, led members of the investigation team and personally took care of everything at the wharf. The Municipal Public Security Bureau sent about 20 officers of the water police and plainclothes police, and the police also sent many Chinese and Western detectives to guard everything. She shook hands with Chiang Tso-pin and Madame Lian Shenghai and hurried off the wheel. She walked extremely fast and did not say a word to the reporters. After leaving the wharf fence, she took the car prepared by the Kung residence and went directly to the Soong residence on Seymour Road to mourn. Kung Hsiang-hsi's two daughters and Soong Tzu-liang and others were in the same car as Madame Sun.</p>
<p>Madame's Appearance Madame Sun wore a snuff-colored Western-style coat, a Western-style hat, deeply pressed against her eyebrows. Her leather shoes and silk stockings were the same color as her coat. She was in good spirits and her appearance was slightly more plump than when she last came to Shanghai. After Madame Sun arrived at the Soong residence, she performed a silent prayer in front of the coffin of Mother Soong in the hall. Soong Ai-ling, Soong Mei-ling, Soong Tzu-wen, Tzu-liang, Tzu-an, and others were all present to perform the ceremony.</p>
<p>Staying in Shanghai Briefly According to sources around her, Madame Sun came here specifically to mourn her mother. After Mother Soong's funeral is over, she plans to stay in Shanghai for a while before deciding on her next course of action. She is currently staying temporarily on Seymour Road and will not move to her residence on Molier Road. It is also rumored that Mr. Zhang Minyi came with Madame Sun, which is not true. Zhang is an engineer and has already landed in Qingdao.</p>
<p>Interview with the Secretary A reporter from the New Voice Society interviewed Ms. Hu Lanqi, the former member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government who came with Madame Sun as her secretary. She said that Madame Sun and others left Berlin on the 31st of last month and came here specifically to mourn her mother. I don't know whether she will return to Germany in the future. In Germany, she often studies in the library and studies the last words of the Premier. Roughly speaking, Madame Sun will publish the collected and supplemented遺著 of the Premier.</p>

<p>French Merchant Tram and Bus</p>
<h3>Yesterday All Stopped</h3>
<p>Eight People Injured Due to Worker Conflict</p>
<p>Machine Department Resumes Work, Transportation Department Halts Again</p>
<p>Formal Traffic Resumes That Evening, Full Resumption Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, a conflict occurred between the machine department and transportation department workers of the French Water and Electricity Company. The machine department workers immediately went on strike, and all trams and buses in the French Concession were stopped. By noon, the machine department issue was resolved, and work resumed uniformly in the afternoon. However, the transportation department workers were unwilling to work and went on strike together. The transportation department issue was also resolved by 6 p.m. At 6:30 p.m., the tram and bus workers on all routes formally resumed work, making a single round trip before returning to the depot. Formal work resumption begins today. The authorities have also sent personnel to thoroughly investigate. The various circumstances of yesterday are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Truth of the Conflict: Qian Ashun, a worker in the lathe shop of the machine department, was walking along the Bund on Avenue Edward VII at 7:20 a.m. yesterday, preparing to take a tram to the factory for work. He bent down to pick up a copper coin that had fallen to the ground. At that moment, Route 2 tram heading to Xujiahui was coming from the 16th Pier. Seeing the worker in front, it immediately braked. The driver used discourteous language, leading to a conflict. Driver Sun Yinglong of tram No. 221, ticket seller Zhang Guisheng of first-class tram No. 35, ticket seller Shi Shiyong of third-class tram No. 361, and ticket seller Gu Yuewen of trailer No. 381 got out of the trams one after another and started beating the worker. As a result, the worker sustained minor internal injuries and immediately went to the factory to report to his fellow workers in the department.</p>
<p>Machine Workers' Strike: More than 1,200 staff and workers in over twenty departments of the machine department, including the lathe shop, waterworks, engineering department, painters, fire department, wiring department, large warehouse, carpenters, motor department, Dongjiadu waterworks, and railway engine department, were extremely angered. They immediately went on strike automatically at 8 a.m. In addition to holding a meeting to discuss countermeasures through the union, they also dispatched inspectors to drive the company's own prepared trams to various locations to dissuade all trams from running, forcing them into the Lujiiawan depot and detaining the offending driver No. 221 and ticket seller No. 35 in the machine department for temporary custody.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting: The First District Water and Electricity Industry Union immediately held an emergency meeting and resolved on the spot to propose: (1) The transportation department shall set off firecrackers to the machine department to express apology; (2) The offending driver and ticket seller shall be dismissed from their positions, and Inspector Li Linshu of Route 2 shall be dismissed from office; (3) The company shall issue a notice to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again in the future; (4) The company shall issue a notice to prohibit drivers and ticket sellers of all trams from beating people, and nominate representatives such as Zhang Renjun, Lu Guanhong, and Xu A’mei to negotiate seriously with the company.</p>
<p>All Trams Stopped: Yesterday at about 9 a.m., more than 80 trams on Routes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 and trolleybuses on Routes 18 and 17 and buses on Routes 21 and 22 in the French Concession were stopped by the machine department workers. They gathered in places such as Lujiiawan and the 16th Pier. Over 80 trams were parked from Xiejiao to Lujiiawan, and from Route Lafayette to the Lujiiawan area. There were also over 10 trams at the 16th Pier. All buses were stopped near Lujiiawan, disrupting traffic.</p>
<p>Machine Department Resumes Work: At around 10 a.m., the machine department sent representatives Xu A’mei, Lu Guanhong, and Zhang Renjun, etc., based on the workers'</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>demands, to negotiate with Manager Monsalant (transliteration) and Chinese Director Du Yuesheng at the company in Lujiiawan. As a result: (1) They purchased 100 yuan worth of firecrackers to express apology; (2) If Inspector Li Linshu of Route 2 is indeed the leader, he will be dismissed from office; (3) The company will issue a notice prohibiting future incidents; (4) The company will post notices in each tram prohibiting ticket sellers and drivers from beating people. The representatives immediately went to the factory to report the negotiation progress. All the workers considered it satisfactory. Dong Guixiang then took a car to Baxianqiao to buy firecrackers. From 12:10 to 12:20 p.m., the sound of firecrackers was incessant from Baxianqiao to Routes Avenue Joffre and Route Pichon. All the machine department workers immediately went home for lunch, and uniformly returned to the factory in the afternoon to resume work.</p>
<p>Setting Off Firecrackers: The 100 yuan worth of firecrackers totaled 500 large cannons (firecrackers of considerable size), and over 100,000 small firecrackers. When they were set off together, the general residents of the French Concession were extremely frightened by the sound, mistaking it for gunfire. The Nanhua sub-bureau authorities in Lujiiawan also sent police to guard the factory. A small shed in the factory caught fire while the firecrackers were being set off. Carried by the wind, it suddenly burned down at 2 p.m., and was completely destroyed in less than five minutes.</p>
<p>Company Prohibition: The management office of the French Water and Electricity Company issued a notice yesterday stating: "Recently, verbal disputes and physical altercations have frequently occurred between the personnel of the machine department and transportation department. This kind of behavior is extremely detrimental to the company's business operations. The manager hereby sincerely advises all company personnel to refrain from such behavior in the future. Anyone who causes further incidents will be severely punished. This is hereby announced."</p>
<p>Authorities' Investigation: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau heard yesterday that all the tram and bus routes of the French Water and Electricity Company had been shut down, disrupting traffic. It immediately sent Zhu Guilin to investigate the truth. Upon learning that it was caused by a conflict between the transportation department and machine department workers and not a labor-capital dispute, he immediately reported the circumstances.</p>
<p>Mutual Assault and Injuries: When the trams and buses of the transportation department returned to the depot, a major conflict occurred between all the drivers, ticket sellers, inspectors, and staff of the transportation department and the workers of the machine department at the gate of the Lujiiawan depot, followed by physical violence. It was reported that Inspector Wu Qishu of Route 2, driver Sun Yinglong of Route 23, ticket seller Zhu Wanjin of Route 7, ticket seller Liu Fusheng of Route 13, ticket seller Sun Hengzhi of Route 170, ticket seller Shi Yingfu of Route 196, and a new ticket seller of Route 203 all sustained minor injuries and were sent to the Guangci Hospital on Rue du Père Robert by the transportation department.</p>
<p>Unwilling to Drive: All 800 staff and workers of the transportation department felt defeated. Afterward, they were all unwilling to work. At 1 p.m., they held an emergency meeting at the Transportation Department Club on Route Massenet and resolved: (1) The coppersmith is to publish an apology in the newspaper and set off firecrackers; (2) The company will punish the offenders responsible; (3) The machine department is to bear the responsibility for medical expenses and the future risks of those who were beaten; (4) Guarantee that such unfortunate incidents will not occur again in the future. Five representatives were nominated: ticket seller Cai Hongjun of Route 38, ticket seller Yan Youqing of Route 254, ticket seller Zhong Runsheng of Route 69, ticket seller Li Xinzhai of Route 178, and driver Zhang Wenming of Route 49 to negotiate with the company.</p>
<p>Meeting with Du Yuesheng: The machine department workers, i.e., the First District Water and Electricity Industry Union, heard that the transportation department workers were going to cause trouble. At 3 p.m., they sent Xu A’mei, Zhang Renjun, Lu Guanhong, Ding Yougen and four others to Du Yuesheng's private residence to request protection. Du Yuesheng replied to the machine workers that they could continue to work as usual and that the strike of the transportation department workers had nothing to do with the machine department and he would be responsible for their protection.</p>
<p>Negotiation Results: Yesterday at 6 p.m., Transportation Department representatives Cai Hongjun, Yan Youqing, Zhang Wenhong, Zhong Runsheng, Li Xinzhai and other five representatives negotiated with Manager Monsalant and Comprador Shen in the company based on the conditions proposed by the workers. As a result: (1) The company will purchase 100 yuan worth of firecrackers to set off as an apology; (2) Work will resume immediately; (3) The company will provide a concrete answer to all conditions before the 18th.</p>
<p>Formal Work Resumption: At 6:30 p.m., the sound of firecrackers rang out loudly in front of the Lujiiawan depot.

Nearby residents were full of doubts and worries again.</p>
<h3>County Government Recruiting Midwifery Students</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, instructing the county to recruit two female students for the Midwifery School attached to the Jiangsu Provincial Hospital for study at the school. It also approved the Jiangsu Provincial Hospital's notification that the Midwifery School would begin classes on September 1. The county may send two students without entrance examination, except for the Chinese language examination, in order to avoid future differences in level. It is requested that the resume and name list of each student be sent to the school by August 15 for registration, and tuition fees will be paid upon enrollment. Yesterday, the county government copied the regulations and posted them for recruitment. Those interested in studying should immediately prepare two 4-inch half-length photos, bring their previous academic certificates or transcripts to the county for registration, and wait for examination and recommendation.</p>
<p>Western Food Industry Workers</p>
<h3>Struck Work the Day Before Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Because the Capitalists Lack Sincerity in Accepting the Conditions</p>
<p>L'Aiglon, Hainssen, etc. Close Down in Succession</p>
<p>More than 300 workers in the Western food industry in this city automatically went on strike the day before yesterday afternoon because they saw that the capitalists were not sincere in accepting the conditions of treatment. L'Aiglon, Hainssen, and others had no choice but to temporarily close down. The Social Affairs Bureau persuaded the workers to resume work first. The various circumstances are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Strike: The Western Food Industry Union, in a resolution passed by a members' meeting on May 6, proposed seven conditions of treatment. On July 27, it submitted them to the Western Food Industry Trade Association, setting a deadline for a concrete reply by 1 p.m. on July 30. When the deadline arrived without a reply, it nominated four representatives, Yao Shutang, Zhao Jinhua, Fu A’lian, and Wu Shenxiang, to negotiate with three representatives of the Trade Association, Wu Furen, Lin Zugen, and Lu Dechang. As a result, it was agreed that the Trade Association would reply by 11 p.m. on August 5 after a meeting and consultation. When the deadline arrived, the capitalists stated that they would reply in two weeks. The workers considered them to be insincere in accepting the conditions and resolved to hold a members' meeting on August 6, sending a letter to the Trade Association setting a deadline for a reply by August 8. When the deadline arrived, the capitalists ignored it. All the workers then implemented an automatic strike at 1 p.m. the day before yesterday (August 12).</p>
<p>A Few Close Down: Western Food companies such as Quan Jia Fu temporarily hired non-members of the Shanghai Western Food Industry Union to work in order to maintain business due to the workers' strike. However, Western food restaurants such as L'Aiglon and Hainssen were forced to temporarily close down due to the workers' strike. Regular patrons of Western food became alarmed.</p>
<p>Authorities' Investigation: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau received a petition from the union stating that the workers had automatically gone on strike and requesting mediation. It immediately sent Zhang Shuye to investigate the truth and persuaded the workers to resume work immediately and await mediation by the authorities in accordance with the law. The Western Food Industry Trade Association also sent all its directors and supervisors to persuade the workers to resume work uniformly today. However, because the workers felt that the capitalists' oppression was too severe, it is still difficult to determine whether work can be resumed today.</p>
<p>Disputed Conditions: The conditions of treatment proposed by the Western Food Industry Union are as follows: (1) The monthly small accounts of each Western food company must be calculated according to the total number of businesses each month, and the distribution must be made public. They must not be reported as more or less. Incidental expenses should also not be included in the account. Those who create various pretexts and workers who do not serve in the store shall not be eligible for this small account. The small accounts obtained by each store's assistant manager shall not exceed three shares; (2) Extra bonuses must not be enjoyed by capitalists, assistant managers, and accounting clerks; (3) One share of the monthly small accounts of each Western food company must be taken from the total amount to be used as a subsidy for the union; (4) The wages of each worker must be calculated as double wages in January, February, July, and August of the Gregorian calendar. Those who should take a holiday on Memorial Day and Labor Day but do not stop work must also be calculated as double wages; (5) Apprentices are required to be 16 years old as the standard. After three years of study, they can be promoted to secondary workers. The small accounts they receive should start at half a share and be increased as appropriate each year depending on the quality of their work. If there is no need to add apprentices, they should not be added at will; (6) Non-union members must not be hired at will, and union members must not be dismissed without fault. For any dismissal of workers, the capitalists must first report to the union. The dismissal can only be implemented after the union investigates clearly whether a dismissal should be made; (7) Kitchen scraps fees should be completely enjoyed by the kitchen staff and must not be included in the small accounts for public distribution.</p>
<p>Foreign Communist Party</p>
<h3>Noulens Handed Over</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that the Westerner couple, the Noulens, were handed over to the Garrison Headquarters yesterday (12th). Unless the Swiss Consul recognizes them as Swiss citizens, they will be tried by a military tribunal. This city has already received a telegram from the London Police Department, stating that the Bray mentioned by Noulens has been found to be someone else. However, the Swiss Consul is still investigating whether Noulens is Swiss or not.</p>
<p>Today (13th), the Shanghai Municipal Police issued a special announcement about its arrest and detention, stating briefly that the order issued by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court regarding the case of a Westerner man and woman of unknown name and nationality accused of illegal communist activities was executed on August 12. After arresting the two individuals on June 15, the police searched No. 235 Sichuan Road, No. 66 West End Garden on Hart Road, and Room 30C, Central Building, No. 49 Nanjing Road. Documents were seized in the house on Nanjing Road, proving that the place was the secretariat of the Pan-Pacific Trade Union, Far East Branch, and the Far Eastern Affairs Office of the Third International. Its purpose was to create a proletarian revolution in countries and colonies along the Pacific. It was found that the secretariat of the Pan-Pacific Trade Union was established in Hankou in the spring of 1927 after the Communist Party conference, and representatives from all over the Pacific were present at that time. Since then, the secretariat has always occupied an important position in communist activities on the Pacific coast. A total of 211 documents and 1,081 other books and letters were seized in the aforementioned four locations. There were English, German, Russian, Japanese, and Chinese texts, including 73 relating to communist activities in China, 18 relating to communist activities in Japan, 4 relating to communist activities in Korea, 14 relating to communist activities in the Philippines, 14 relating to communist activities in Vietnam, 10 relating to communist activities in the Malay Peninsula, 1 relating to communist activities in Taiwan, and 1 relating to communist activities in India. The expenses of the Shanghai branch, about 130,000 yuan per month, were also found. In the evidence submitted to the Second Branch of the High Court on August 8, it was discovered that the defendants had a total of five addresses, four telegraphic addresses, and eight rented postal boxes. The deposits in seven banks in China amounted to 47,500 yuan. In addition, a huge amount of foreign currency was seized in the aforementioned locations. The aliases used jointly by the two individuals were the Fantlucks, the Noulenes, the Moodes, the Lukes, and the Brays. In addition, there were seven or eight aliases used exclusively by the male defendant and one used exclusively by the female defendant.</p>

<h3>Sun Yat-Sen Stamps Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Totaling 120 Million Pieces</p>
<p>Effective September 1</p>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts of the Ministry of Communications, during the tenure of Director-General Long Dafu years ago, ordered 1.5 billion pieces of Sun Yat-Sen stamps from the De La Rue Printing Company in England, to be printed and delivered to the Directorate General in installments over a period of five years. The Directorate General also had seven posthumous portrait plates of the martyrs Chen Qimei, Huang Xing, Song Jiaoren, Deng Keng, etc., engraved at the British Printing Company and handed over to the Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in Peiping to print new stamps. The Postal Directorate General has decided to implement the use of the stamps in the postal districts of all provinces starting from September 1. However, the official circular has not yet been announced. It is now known that the first batch of Sun Yat-Sen stamps recently printed by the British Printing Company, totaling 120 million pieces, packed into over 70 large boxes, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The stamps are available in denominations of one fen, two fen, four fen, and two jiao and four jiao. The postal authorities are now distributing them separately and will issue new stamps together with the circular to the 23 postal districts across the country within the month, to be implemented starting on September 1. They can be found in all provinces, cities, and provincial capitals at that time. However, due to the urgency of time, it may be difficult to popularize the distribution quantity in each province and county. It is said that the seven new stamps of the martyrs printed by the Printing and Minting Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in Peiping are currently being printed. It is feared that there will not be enough pieces to deliver by September 1, so the implementation period will take some time.</p>
<p>Tonight</p>
<h3>Merchants Discuss Anti-Japanese Matters</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing and Others Host Banquet for Leaders of Various Industries</p>
<p>The Shanghai community believes that the current Anti-Japanese and Overseas Chinese Aid Association is not perfect in terms of organization, and foreigners are employing various obstructive measures. Shanghai business leaders such as Yu Qiaqing are also aware of this. They have decided to directly handle the anti-Japanese movement themselves by merchants. Together with the five standing committee members of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, they have jointly invited the leaders of various industry trade associations in this city to a banquet at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce at 6 p.m. today (14th). During the banquet, they will discuss ways to improve the affairs of the Anti-Japanese Association.</p>
<p>Chen Shaokuan</p>
<h3>Discusses Sending Warships to Cuba to Comfort Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Chen Shaokuan, Vice Minister of the Navy and Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and had the following conversation with people: (1) The Navy's dispatch of the Hai Rong warship to Cuba to participate in the opening ceremony of the Revolutionary Monument erected by the overseas Chinese in Cuba and to comfort the overseas Chinese was ordered by the central government. However, the time required to arrive before Double Tenth (October 10) may be insufficient, as the Hai Rong does not carry much coal. For this long voyage, another ship must be used to transport coal and water to an appropriate location for resupply, otherwise it cannot reach directly. This matter is currently being considered and planned by the Ministry, and all other preparations are also underway. However, it has not been decided who will be the commander sent in the future; (2) Commander Chen Jiliang will arrive in the Three-City Maneuvers, probably tonight (that is, yesterday). Hai Chou left Shanghai yesterday. Tong Ji and Yong Jian will set off and go directly to Sandu within a day or two after the inspection and repair work is completed. The maneuvers will begin as soon as Commander Chen arrives. The rumor that the maneuvers have been postponed to start on the 20th is incorrect; (3) Li Shijia, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of the Navy, who was previously sent to the Bomo Shipyard in Japan to supervise the Ning Hai warship, has now completed his mission and is expected to return to Shanghai around the 17th or 18th.</p>

<p>Chinese Representative Already Appointed</p>
<h3>Deputy Director of the International Labor Council</h3>
<p>Zhu Maocheng Writes Letter to Yang Youren</p>
<p>The directors of the International Labor Council are re-elected every three years by the International Labor Conference. Since the establishment of the National Government of China, it has sent a full delegation to the conference every year, and this year marks the third year. At this year's International Labor Conference, the Chinese delegation made every effort to campaign. However, due to the historical relations in Europe, there were considerable alliances. As a result, China was not elected by a difference of only four votes. However, the members of the delegation all believed that given the large number of workers in China and the efforts made in recent years on international labor issues, China should have an appropriate position in the International Labor Council. Therefore, they expressed this to Mr. Thomas, Director of the International Labor Office, who agreed and introduced them to Belgium to discuss the matter. After the close of the conference, the chief representative, Mr. Zhu Maocheng, actively contacted the Belgian government. Yesterday, Mr. Yang Youren, the labor representative of this term, received a letter from Mr. Zhu Maocheng from Belgium, stating that as a result of the meeting with the Belgian government, China has been approved to be the deputy director of the Belgian permanent director of the International Labor Council. Through the Chinese government, China can now occupy a considerable position in the International Labor Council. If Italy can approve the increase in the number of directors in the International Labor Council, then the issue of China's representation in the International Labor Council next year will be resolved.</p>
<p>Recovering Concessions</p>
<h3>First Need to Recover Roads Built Beyond Boundaries</h3>
<p>Telegram from the 26th Branch of the Municipal Federation</p>
<p>The 26th District Branch of the Shanghai Special Zone Citizens' Federation sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "The initial step in recovering the concessions is to plan to recover the roads built beyond boundaries. The Shanghai concessions have been occupied by imperialists, who have taken an inch and want a mile, driven by their ambitions, leading to the construction of roads beyond boundaries everywhere. Our honest government has implemented its ideology and has a complete foreign policy for territorial integrity. Your excellencies are planning strategies, negotiating treaties, and carrying out negotiations. However, in areas such as North Sichuan Road, the roads were built beyond boundaries. Unexpectedly, the Japanese marines dared to conduct street fighting exercises, alarming nearby citizens and disrupting traffic. This kind of illegal act is outrageous. In short, the Japanese soldiers think they are flaunting their power, but our Chinese citizens know that they are just trying to intimidate us. The matter concerns the country, so we urgently request that your excellencies quickly recover the roads built beyond boundaries and then prepare to recover the concessions, so as to avoid foreigners having an excuse to completely occupy the land of the Republic of China. The citizens are fortunate, and the Party and the country are fortunate."</p>

<h3>National Games Specially Opens National Goods Commercial Venue</h3>
<p>National Goods Groups Continue to Discuss Implementation Methods</p>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association believes that the National Games held in Beijing during Double Tenth is a rare opportunity to promote national goods and advocates finding ways to make the commercial venue and advertisements inside the venue all national goods. It sent a telegram to the National Games Organizing Committee to negotiate. Yesterday, it received a reply from the committee stating: "China National Goods Maintenance Association: The contents of the telegram have been noted. This case was previously approved by the Ministry of Industry and the previous resolution. We have always promoted national goods and have not dared to fall behind. If the National Goods Exhibition Hall intends to open a national goods commercial venue, the committee can open another venue in the venue, named the National Goods Commercial Zone. However, all equipment, layout, and other expenses shall be borne by the contractor, and the committee will not be responsible for any of them. This is the reply. If your Association has matters to prepare for the National Goods Store, you can directly contact the Nanjing National Goods Exhibition Hall for processing. This is a special reply. Prepared Committee of the National Games, reverently printed." The Standing Committee of the Association has resolved that this matter is far from the resolution made by the joint meeting of the National Goods Groups. It is specially scheduled to convene the second joint meeting again at 4 p.m. on Friday, the 14th of this month, to discuss the continuation of the implementation methods in order to promote national goods.</p>
<p>National Goods Exhibition Hall of This City</p>
<h3>Handling of National Goods Certification</h3>
<p>Provisional Measures for National Goods Certification Proposed</p>
<p>Our city's National Goods Exhibition Hall, taking this city as a major port for Chinese and foreign trade, and also as a flourishing industrial and commercial area, with numerous factories and shops, and complex and diverse products. Especially, cunning merchants and market speculators are mixed in, only knowing private interests and disregarding public morality, often transporting and selling foreign goods, secretly changing trademarks, passing them off as national goods, and even imitating brand names, which has a significant impact on the future development of national goods. In order to remedy this situation, it is proposed to handle national goods certification to prevent counterfeiting. The provisional measures for national goods certification of this city's National Goods Exhibition Hall, consisting of ten articles, have been drafted and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. The articles of the measures are now recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Provisional Measures for National Goods Certification of Shanghai National Goods Exhibition Hall</p>
<p>1.  Any manufacturer in this city who wishes to apply to this hall for certification that their products are indeed national goods shall comply with these measures.</p>
<p>2.  The applicant shall submit a petition, along with samples of the products for which certification is requested, together with drawings, specifications, and trademarks, three copies each, for review.</p>
<p>3.  The application shall state the following items, and shall be signed and sealed by the applicant or their agent: (1) Product name, (2) Trademark, (3) Producer, (4) Place of production, (5) Capital, (6) Factory name or company, (7) Raw materials, (8) Labor.</p>
<p>4.  Each certificate shall be limited to one type of product.</p>
<p>5.  The certification fee is temporarily waived, and only a handling fee of two yuan per item will be charged, to be submitted with the application. However, if the same manufacturer applies for certification for two or more types of products at the same time, the handling fee will only be charged once.</p>
<p>6.  The products submitted for certification will be subject to on-site investigation by personnel dispatched by this hall. If they are deemed to meet the national goods standards stipulated by the Ministry of Industry, a certificate will be issued according to the grade.</p>
<p>7.  In case of any doubts, the issuance of the certificate will be suspended. The handling fee will not be refunded. However, if there are special reasons, the producer may apply for re-examination.</p>
<p>8.  All national goods certified by this hall shall be entitled to the rights under various preferential treatment regulations for national goods in this city, and may request to be forwarded to the Ministry of Industry for verification and issuance of the national goods certificate issued by the Ministry.</p>
<p>9.  If there are any matters not covered in these measures, they may be amended at any time, and reported to the competent authority for forwarding to the Municipal Government for approval and record.</p>
<p>10. These measures shall be implemented from the date of submission to the Social Affairs Bureau for forwarding to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>

<h3>A Hand Reaches In Through the Window</h3>
<h3>Wu Baoqing Assassinated</h3>
<p>Wu Sits by the Window in the Kitchen</p>
<p>The Assassin's Gun Enters Through the Window</p>
<p>The Bullet Flies Out and Wu Falls to the Ground</p>
<p>Dead Upon Arrival at the Hospital</p>
<p>Wu Baoqing, from Jiangyin, formerly served as the head of the detective team of the Public Security Bureau in Jiangyin and Changzhou. After being dismissed, he came to Shanghai and lived at No. 854 Binlang Road, in the French Concession, where he ran a firewood shop for a living. At around 8:50 last night, Wu was sitting alone by the window in the kitchen, facing inward and with his back to the window. Suddenly, a hand reached in through the window and fired a gun at Wu's back. After the bullet flew out, Wu immediately fell to the ground. At that time, the second landlord, Jiang Jinsheng, was sitting in the living room and rushed in to check after hearing the sound. He saw that Wu Baoqing had fallen to the ground with blood flowing out. He immediately reported to the Gordon Road Patrol Station, which took Wu by car to Renji Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, he was already dead upon arrival at the hospital. Examinations revealed one bullet wound in the face and one in the abdomen. The deceased, also known as Biao, was 34 years old. It is said that Wu had arrested communists several times during his tenure, and thus may have made enemies.</p>
<h3>A Dancing Girl Covered in Feces</h3>
<p>From Paris to Shanghai</p>
<p>Inevitably Makes Enemies in Paris</p>
<p>This Action is Someone's Directive</p>
<p>The Judge Adjourns the Hearing for Further Investigation</p>
<p>Sun Aiying, a dancing girl from a Shanghai dance hall, from Nanjing, residing at No. 552 Dagu Road, was riding in a rickshaw to the Shanghai dance hall at around 10 p.m. the night before. As the rickshaw passed the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Maohuo Road, Zhou Fugen from Wuxi, Qiu Genfa from Nanjing, and Ye Zixiang from Ningbo suddenly blocked the way. Qiu and Ye held the rickshaw, while Zhou threw feces prepared in a cigarette can at Sun, hitting her head and covering her face with yellow and white substances that smelled terrible. At that time, Sun's silk scarf and a pin were also missing. Sun then shouted frantically, and two Chinese constables, No. 2313 and No. 2398, arrived and helped chase them, and Zhou and the others were caught at Baker Road. They were taken to the Xinzha Patrol Station together and sent to the summary court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Qian Xunjiu, the patrol station's lawyer, explained the case and stated that Sun Aiying had previously been a dancing girl in a Paris dance hall and had just entered Shanghai. According to the patrol station's investigation, this incident was instigated by Ge Chongxi, the manager of the Paris dance hall, who instructed Zhou Degong, who then instructed the three defendants to commit this prank. Subsequently, Sun Aiying stated in her statement that she had been a dancing girl in a Paris dance hall without a contract. When the Shanghai dance hall opened, she entered into a contract with the Shanghai dance hall. Manager Ge Chongxi did not agree and insisted that she stay in Paris, agreeing to sign a three-month contract. Last Friday, the contract expired, and she left Paris and entered Shanghai. When she left, Ge Chongxi told her companion Wang Xiuying that he would make things difficult for her. Now he has resorted to this vicious attack, which is due to two reasons: (1) He hates me for leaving Paris, and (2) Ge had previously harassed me, but I refused. These two reasons have caused today's incident. But I am a weak woman who relies on my business to make a living while I am young. If he continues to make trouble, then my future will be unimaginable. I request a strict investigation. Subsequently, Wang Xiuying stated in her statement that she, Sun Aiying, and Chen Huiying left Paris at the same time. When I resigned to Ge Chongxi, Ge said that if Sun Aiying left alone, I would not harm her at all. Now that you four are leaving at the same time, I will break her legs so that she cannot make a living. Now that this has happened, our future is extremely dangerous. Chen Huiying also submitted a statement to testify, and her words were the same as Wang's. When questioned, the three defendants all claimed that they were instructed by Zhou Degong. At this point, Sun Aiying stated again that the second defendant, Qiu Genfa, was a waiter in Paris and therefore knew me. Presiding Judge Cheng Shangfeng verified the statements and considered that this case was instigated by Ge Chongxi and Zhou Degong and that the two should be summoned to court. He then ordered the case to be adjourned pending the summons of Ge Xichong and Zhou Degong for investigation.</p>
<h3>The Fall of Pu Jinghong, a Shanghai Beauty</h3>
<p>Death Due to Heart Attack from Burns</p>
<p>The Old Mother Cries and Faints</p>
<p>Pu Jinghong, also named Kunying, a Suzhou woman, a singing and dancing queen and movie actress residing on the upper floor of No. 43 Fuchang Lane, Xiafei Road, French Concession, was only seventeen years old this year. In the afternoon the other day, after finishing filming a talkie at the Tianyi Film Company at No. 232 Gansidong Road in the French Concession, she asked the photographer to take additional stills. She went to the makeup room to get her hair permed. Due to a momentary oversight, the alcohol in the hair perm exploded and burned her head, face, hands, and feet. She was sent to Renji Hospital. Due to burns attacking her heart, she died at 2:40 a.m. yesterday despite treatment. The hospital reported the incident to the Shanzhong Road Patrol Station, which dispatched detectives to move the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue for examination. Later, the corpse's mother, Pu Lu, reported to the general patrol station, stating that her daughter's death was tragic and requested exemption from the examination and wished to collect the body herself. The head of the patrol station approved. Subsequently, Tianyi Company, in view of the poverty of the family, gave 500 yuan for funeral expenses, and clothing and a coffin were prepared in the afternoon for collecting the body, which was temporarily placed in the guild hall. When the body was collected, the corpse's mother mourned her daughter's tragic death and fainted. She was awakened by neighbors and was taken home by car. But Pu's father passed away last month, and the day of Kunying's accident happened to be the fifth seven-day period after his death. The unexpected tragedy is extremely painful.</p>

<h3>Divorce Due to Wife's Adultery</h3>
<p>The Wife Raises Questions in Prison</p>
<p>Still a Lingering Affection After the Divorce</p>
<p>Ren Kebin from Qingpu, has been working as a manager at the Yu Xin Pawnshop on Gudian Road. On the third day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar in 1927, he married Chen, the daughter of Chen, a fellow villager. They had two children, both of whom died prematurely. This spring, Ren rented a house on the upper floor of a sock factory at No. 4 Juxing Lane, Nine Acres, Xiaobeimen. Due to the nature of Ren's work, he did not often return home at night. However, Chen was young, beautiful, and also lewd. Unable to bear sleeping alone, she secretly became acquainted with Zhu Baoshan. Their secret meetings were not just a matter of days. On September 9 of this year, Zhu went to Chen's place for a tryst again, which happened to be discovered by Ren upon returning home. Helpless, Ren was weak and did not argue with her. He only drove Zhu away and advised his wife to change her ways. Unexpectedly, the woman was passionate about her affair and invited Zhu home again on the 12th to continue their pleasure. By coincidence, Ren saw them again upon returning home. So, he could no longer bear it and confronted her and drove Zhu out. Zhu, ashamed and angry, returned with a sharp knife and committed the crime on the spot. Ren reported the incident to the police, who arrested Zhu and Chen and took them to court. After the interrogation, the adultery was confirmed. As a result, the adulterer and adulteress were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment and sent to prison to serve their sentences. Now, Ren Kebin, because Chen had committed adultery several times, making it difficult to live together, hired lawyer Liu Xiang to apply to the conciliation office of the district court for divorce. Yesterday, Judge Chen Bingxin opened the court for conciliation and sent a letter to the Second Prison to have Ren Chen brought to the court. First, Ren Kebin stated that he was 26 years old and currently lived at No. 5 Dapu Lane, Dapu Bridge, and stated the previous circumstances, requesting permission to divorce. Next, Ren Chen stated that she was 25 years old and did not want a divorce. (Question) When will your sentence be completed? (Answer) It will be completed on September 18, but I am currently four months pregnant. At this point, Ren Kebin said, This pregnancy is not mine, and I cannot admit it. The judge obtained the statement and repeatedly enlightened the two parties. As a result, Ren Kebin paid Ren Chen 30 yuan for the expenses during her childbirth, and the marriage was allowed to be dissolved. The judge drafted a reconciliation record in court and ordered the two parties to sign and leave the court. Ren Chen was taken back by the prison guard for execution of the sentence. After leaving the court, Ren gave his wife a silver dollar for pocket money and four or five packages of food, and repeatedly told her a few words, reluctantly parting. At that time, the bystanders all said, Since you are so affectionate, why bother to divorce? Ren said that his divorce was a last resort and left after saying this.</p>

Therefore, the Shanghai Court has now transferred Ren for public trial in accordance with Article 241, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the same law.</p>
<h3>Unlicensed Hawkers Escorted Back to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Hiding Place is Exposed</p>
<p>The French postal ship "Ansse Ile" was exported last month and contained 27 hawkers, including those from Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Fujian. They were hidden by a certain leader. However, the scheme was not secret. When the shipowner and staff of the shipping company inspected the bottom of the ship in the French territory, the 27 hawkers hidden in the cabin were discovered and arrested. When the leader knew that the matter was revealed, he immediately escaped. A suspected cook was detained and escorted back to Shanghai by the original ship. When it arrived at the port yesterday morning, the French Postal Ship Company notified the Passport Inspection Office of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau at No. 9 Hankou Road to quickly dispatch personnel to the French ship to receive them. Chen, the deputy director, informed the Pujiang Water Patrol Team, and Captain Xu assigned police officers to the patrol boat to go to the French ship to receive the 27 hawkers who went abroad without passports and the suspected cook and took them back to the bureau for handling.</p>

He immediately packed it up and placed it back on the ground in the original place, waiting for the person who lost it to come and look for it.

Upon receiving the report, the Federation immediately informed the fire associations in each district to send fire trucks to the scene. Unexpectedly, when the personnel arrived at the scene, they inspected the store and found that there was no fire. When they urgently inquired the people in the store, they said they did not know. Because the matter involved falsely reporting a fire, they immediately ordered the local police to take the owner of the Daoxiangcun store to the No. 1 General Office of the District for punishment according to the regulations. When the fire engine arrived at the scene, the neighbors of the store were already frightened by the false alarm.</p>
<p>Zhang Awan</p>
<h3>Accusation of Husband Forcing Her to Be a Dancing Girl</h3>
<p>Swears Not to Return Home</p>
<p>Her Husband Sues in Civil Court</p>
<p>Zhu Mingzhu, a woman from Ningbo residing at No. 469 half, Yongnian Lane, Baker Road, was formerly a dancing girl at the Xin Xin Dance Hall and has now transferred to the Shanghai Dance Hall. Her brother, Zhu Tugeng, is a coppersmith at the Yangshupu Power Company, with a monthly income of about 30 yuan. On the sixth day of the tenth month of last year, he married Zhang Awan, the daughter of Zhang Xiangming from Shaoxing. They initially lived together in Hongxing Lane, North Henan Road, and have now moved to No. 44, North Xizang Road. On July 10 of this year, Zhu Zhang Awan suddenly surrendered herself to the Jiliang Institute, stating that she could not bear the abuse of her husband and that her husband wanted to force her to be a dancing girl, so she asked to be taken in. The institute reported the matter to the Xinzha Patrol Station, which ordered Detective Sun Hanying to take Zhu Zhang Awan to the First Special District Court and request a decision. The Special Court then ruled to temporarily send her to the Women and Children Relief Association. Zhu Tugeng hired a lawyer and submitted a statement to the Special Court, requesting permission to take his wife back and giving a guarantee that he would never abuse her or force her to be a dancing girl in the future, otherwise he would be subject to legal sanctions. The Special Court granted the request. Yesterday morning, the Criminal Tribunal, headed by Court President Xu Jia, opened the court for interrogation. On the police side, lawyer Ru Baoyi appeared in court. Zhu Tugeng stated that after his wife came to his house, she returned to her mother's house. On June 14 of this year, Zhang Awan's mother's house moved to No. 2 Honglin Lane, Kangti Road, and Awan returned home to take care of it. Unexpectedly, she left and never returned. He went to pick her up, but she did not want to go home. Later, he went to his father-in-law's house again, but they had already moved. After several investigations, he learned that they had moved to No. 1585 Changsha Road, and he went to negotiate and was able to take her back. But before long, she ran away again and was found and escaped again, and then surrendered to the Jiliang Institute. Her claims of abuse and being forced to be a dancing girl were all untrue. He now requests permission to take his wife back. Zhu Zhang Awan stated that on November 25 of last year, Zhu Tugeng struck her head open, and the scars are still there. Recently, he tried to force me to be a dancing girl but failed, and then stabbed me with scissors. Unable to bear it, I surrendered to the Jiliang Institute. Now I wish to spend my old age in the Relief Association and do not want to go home with my husband. Court President Xu told her that before a divorce is confirmed, the name of husband and wife still exists, and she should live with her husband and cannot stay outside, and the Relief Association is not a long-term plan. It is better to go home with her husband and be treated with kindness, and there should be no more violence. Her claim that she does not want to go home with her husband is not in accordance with the law. However, she firmly refused to comply. Zhu Tugeng's lawyer asked the court to make a ruling ordering her to return home. Court President Xu declared that a ruling could of course be made, but if she firmly refused to return, then this court is a criminal court and cannot enforce it. He should file a lawsuit in the civil court. He then ordered Zhu Zhang to return home with her husband Zhu Tugeng and that the Relief Association should not keep her. If she still did not want to return, the two parties could file a lawsuit in the civil court for a ruling. Upon hearing the judgment, she expressed her firm unwillingness to return home with her husband, and Zhu Tugeng also declared that he would file another lawsuit. The court then ordered that she remain temporarily in the Relief Association.</p>

<h3>Seven Mile Long Beach Tour Group</h3>
<p>Yan Ziling Fishing Terrace in Zhejiang is located at Qili Long Beach of Fuchun River, where the river flows rapidly and the scenery is natural. For thousands of years, all famous hermits and scholars who have visited this place must stop and linger. The beauty of the scenery can be imagined. However, although Fuchun River is close to West Lake, those who visit West Lake cannot always visit Fuchun River at the same time.

<p>Municipal Public Instructions</p>
<h3>Privately Operated Public Utility Companies</h3>
<p>Purchasing Foreign Materials</p>
<p>Should Calculate in National Currency</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau believes that when Chinese merchants purchase foreign materials and machinery, the price is calculated in foreign currency. However, foreign currency prices fluctuate indefinitely. Although it can sometimes be cheaper, the budget will be greatly affected if losses are incurred, and there have been many cases of collapse. The responsibilities borne by various privately operated public utility companies in the city are to serve the people, and the relationship is very important, not comparable to ordinary merchants. Therefore, it is absolutely not allowed to take risks and speculate. Yesterday, it specifically instructed the companies, etc., that in the future, when purchasing materials and machinery from foreign countries, the price should be calculated in national currency. It should be explained before signing the contract, and they should be instructed to clarify this national currency price when quoting, and the time period within which it is valid, to avoid disputes when making a decision. The contract should be completely based on Chinese, and even if other foreign languages are prepared, they can only be used as attachments. Furthermore, for the sake of prudence, this purchase contract must be reported to the bureau. If there is a loss in the exchange of Chinese and foreign currency, it must not be included in the company's accounts and should be borne by the person in charge.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Flood Relief Association Begs for Rescue Telegram</h3>

Floods are rampant, causing damage in more than 40 counties. All areas along the Yangtze River, the Grand Canal, and the coastal areas, extending over a thousand miles, have suffered. Crops are submerged, and people and livestock are drifting in the rivers and rising tides. Houses are swept away by huge waves, and lakes and rivers are connected, causing panic among the people. Moreover, the three lakes roar together, and the three dams are opened at the same time, destroying thousands of embankment dikes in an instant. The human tragedy is extreme, and it is a rare sight in a century. The affected victims have no place to live, clinging to the tops of trees and the edges of mounds, building nests on wooden frames, exposed to wind and rain, and unable to call for help. If relief is not provided urgently, they will inevitably end up in ditches. We are heartbroken by what we have seen and are at a loss. To implement benevolent governance and provide relief, we can only rely on the national treasury. We earnestly implore you to consider the magnitude of the disaster, which concerns the vitality of the nation, and quickly allocate huge sums for urgent relief to save more lives, which will cultivate more vitality for the country. Emergency treatment is a matter of urgency, and it is by no means comparable to passivity. We hope for compassion and are overcome with anxiety. Wang Zhen, Huang Qinglan, and Cheng Jingsheng of the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association Preparation Office, bow, Wen.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhaoxiang, the fourth district detective captain of the Jiangsu Water Police Bureau, was sentenced to seven years in prison for abusing his power and beating boatman Lu A'gen to death. After Lu's mother sued the Shanghai District Court, Zhang was detained and the case was confirmed. Zhang was sentenced to seven years in prison as a warning. Zhang refused to accept the sentence and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Jiangsu High Court. The Shanghai Court transferred Zhang and the case files to the Suzhou High Court for repeated interrogation. Yesterday, the judgment was made, and the appeal was rejected. The original sentence will still be executed.</p>

<h3>Continuation of Trial in Camera Newspaper Case</h3>
<p>No One from Camera Newspaper Appears in Court</p>
<p>Liang Claims the Newspaper Was Close to Extortion</p>
<p>Liang Saizhen, a female actress from the Star Film Company, believed that a news item titled "The Illegitimate Child of Liang Saizhen, an Unofficial History Outside the Silver Screen" published on June 20 in Camera Newspaper at No. 12 Parker Road damaged her reputation, so she hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to file a lawsuit against the newspaper and its editor in the First District Court of the Special Zone. After a summons, the case has been previously heard. Because the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Li Muzhi, did not appear, it was ordered that he be summoned again. This has been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning was the date for the continuation of the trial, but no one from the defendant's side responded, and no lawyers appeared in court. Only the plaintiff Liang Saizhen and lawyer Zhan appeared. Liang Saizhen stated that the news about her in the Camera Newspaper on June 20, claiming that she abused her daughter and had a relationship with Xu Xinfu, was completely untrue. After investigation, Xu Xinfu is a staff member of the Star Company's branch, and she is an actress of the main company, so they know each other, but there is no relationship whatsoever. Furthermore, Xu is not specifically responsible for picking up and dropping off actors, so why is he being slandered for no reason? As for the daughter, who is now four years old, she is hired by her mother to raise her, and there is no abuse. After the newspaper published this inaccurate news, she immediately wrote a letter requesting a correction and also called to express her concern. However, not only did the newspaper not correct it immediately, but it also said that she should personally go to smooth things over, otherwise there would be many more news stories about her that would continue to be published. Observing its intention, it was close to extortion, so she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit. Then, lawyer Zhan submitted a letter from Camera Newspaper to Ms. Liang as evidence. After Judge Feng Shide verified the confession, he ordered the case to be rescheduled for seven days and summoned Li Muzhi to court for questioning.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>Dear Sir, In the news column of your newspaper on the 13th, a news item was published about the election of the Women's Relief Association. After investigation, it was found that it was not completely accurate. The points of error are corrected as follows: It was found that districts 1, 2, and 4, etc., were formally established before August 1, districts 6 were established after August 1, and districts 7 were only established on the 12th. According to law, only districts 1, 2, and 4 had the right to vote. Districts 6 and 7 had no right to vote. When the two sides disputed, the representative of our party department immediately announced that districts 6 and 7 could not participate in the election, and the election proceeded as usual. The representative of our party department was present to supervise the election and did not state that he was not responsible for this election. The information in your newspaper is untrue and is specifically corrected. To Shen Bao, Secretariat of the Shanghai Special City Party Department, August 13.</p>

<p>The Strongman in Prison</p>
<p>In Blackpool, England, a man was jailed for a crime and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. His hands were shackled and tied behind his back, making it virtually impossible to use any force. Who knew that he would break the shackles, attack the patrolmen, and even smash the iron bars in the cell into pieces? With such divine power, he can be called the second Samson.</p>
<p>A Chapel Made of Cardboard</p>
<p>Twenty miles outside Johannesburg, the first town in Transval, Africa, on the border of Benoni, there is a chapel made entirely of cardboard, without a single piece of wood. It was transported from England piece by piece twenty-one years ago and assembled locally. Although it has been a long time, it is still usable. It was recently moved from Benoni to another location and will probably be usable for many more years.</p>

<h3>Talking about Qingcheng in the Dog Days</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yan</p>
<p>The place where Wu Peifu is currently visiting</p>
<p>This newspaper's Chengdu dispatch on the 7th stated that Wu Peifu had arrived in Chengdu and was staying at Zhaojue Temple, and that he was going to Qingcheng Mountain in Guan County for sightseeing. When I visited Chengdu in the past, I visited Qingcheng once. The mountains and rivers there are no less beautiful than West Lake. Based on what I know, I will record one or two things for the readers.</p>
<p>Zhaojue Temple: The temple is located two or three miles outside the north gate of Chengdu and is the most famous large monastery in the county. There are many monks and the temple property is wealthy. The temple site is chair-shaped, with ancient trees towering on all sides and beautiful scenery. The halls and buildings are majestic, with carved beams and painted pillars. During the Qing Dynasty, it had more than 7,000 mu of farmland, half of which was confiscated by Zhou Xiaohuai, the patrolling police officer. Now there are only two or three thousand mu of farmland, which is still a huge monastery. Therefore, it is a place for celebrities to stay.</p>
<p>Guan County's Special Weather: Guan County is located in the western part of Chengdu, about one hundred miles away from the province. The folk customs are simple and honest. The main products are medicinal materials and wool. Half of the city wall is靠山. The climate is suitable for all seasons. The most amazing thing is that the men, women, old and young in the county, even without Zhuge Liang's ability to calculate, can know the future weather. Determine whether the next day will be sunny, cloudy, windy, or rainy. The method is after every day is over. If there is a strong wind, the next day will be calm and the sun will fill the window. If there is no wind, the next day will be either rainy or cloudy. The locals have tried it hundreds of times without fail. It is truly an amazing thing.</p>
<p>Qingcheng Mountain's Beautiful Scenery: Qingcheng Mountain is about fifty miles away from Guan County. The mountain has thirty-six peaks, each with its own scenery. There is no winter or summer. The climate is suitable. Therefore, the Sichuan people have the saying that the scenery of Qingcheng Mountain covers the world. Every summer, the盛况 of Chinese and foreign people who go there to escape the heat is no less than Mogan or Lushan. The mountain stone is engraved with the words "The First Peak in the World." The characters are very large and powerful. Written by Huang Yunhu, the Qing Chengdu prefect. There is the Shangqing Palace in the mountain. Chunyang 覯. Heavenly Master along the temples. The mountain scenery includes Mandarin Duck Well. Its water is clear and sweet. When brewing tea, even the water from Tiger Spring is inferior. There is also Golden Whip Rock. A black tiger and Xuan Tan Zhao Gongming's golden whip are hanging between the cliffs. When the sun rises, it reflects with the red sun. The Xia light is brilliant. The sting is dazzling. It is a spectacle. The rest of the beautiful scenery cannot be recorded. I will摘 its big ones. Slightly recorded one or two.</p>
<h3>Gold Plate and Silver Cup</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Gold plate and silver cup. It is also the name of a medicine. However, it is not something that can be bought from ordinary pharmacies. It is a rare treasure if it is obtained by chance. I heard a guest talk about it yesterday. It's very novel and pleasing. The guest is from Puqi. There is a scholar in his place who is known for his romantic 放诞. He spends his days indulging in fine wine and women. Eventually, he develops a numb paralysis. Acupuncture and massage are ineffective. He stays in a room, unable to step out of his bounds. His heart is very worried. This goes on for three years. One day, a Sichuan monk comes. His beard and face are pale. His tattered robe reveals his elbows. He says he can cure intractable diseases and strange ailments. The scholar knows of this. Because the doctors are helpless, he summons the monk to try. The monk takes one look and gives him a pinch of powder to swallow. He also prepares six small bags for him to take without fail during his coming recovery. Seven days later, the monk comes uninvited. The scholar is already completely healed. He stands up and expresses his gratitude. He asks the monk by what technique he achieved this. The monk replies, "This is the national treasure of the gold plate and silver cup. This old monk dares not take the credit." Then he describes the origin of the gold plate and silver cup. Last year, while traveling to Hubei, he stayed at a temple. The temple is near a field. In the twilight dusk, a shepherd boy led his calf past. I have always liked to listen to the innocent words of shepherd children. The children all consider me to be 親. One day, someone saw a dog leaving excrement on cow dung, which piled up into a small hill. It was quite interesting. I was very happy when I heard this, saying, "This is a good medicine that I have been seeking for years but have not been able to obtain." He ordered the child to lead him to the place. He found it,裏ed it, and returned. It was dried, exposed to the sun, and ground into powder. This is the so-called gold plate and silver cup. However, you must not let the sick family know about it first. If they know, they will definitely vomit and not accept it. The medicine will not reach the inner organs. The reason why I did not tell you in advance is precisely because of this." After the scholar recovered from his long illness, he gave the monk a lot of money as a reward. The monk did not accept it, saying, "There is no need for this thing." He is also a great monk. According to the Yunlu Man Chao, water lilies are gold cups and silver platforms. Now, according to what the Sichuan monk said, I don't know if there is this name in ancient medical books. I also ask the medical experts of today.</p>
<h3>Water Mirror</h3>
<p>— Yi Si</p>
<p>Farmers in Jiujiang Town, Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, mostly engage in fish farming. People in this profession possess an extraordinary technique for assessing water levels. Each year, on the day of the Beginning of Spring, those skilled in this art go to the riverbank and draw water into an earthenware bowl. By merely using their fingers to measure its weight, they can determine the height of the water rise for that year and whether there will be floods. This has been proven accurate repeatedly and is truly a remarkable skill.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by observing where cicada shells adhere between spring and winter, and the distance from the ground, one can also predict the depth of the water rise for that year. Unfortunately, they only know how to do it but cannot explain the reason behind it. Hopefully, scientists will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>A Gramophone Summer Solace</h3>
<p>— Gu Yan</p>
<p>The blazing sun makes one feel as if sitting in a furnace. How can one escape such intense heat? To seek physical and mental pleasure, one must find alternative paths to enjoyment. I borrowed a set of the latest records from the Beka company from a friend. There were about thirty types. I listened to each one carefully and didn’t feel bored even after three days and nights. They were truly captivating. Now, I will offer my humble opinions and record them. Ma Lianliang’s "Beheading the Son" creates a unique style in its aria. Liu Bo can no longer claim exclusive excellence. "Beating the Nephew at the Grave" is distinguished by its recitative. Wang Shaolou’s "Lamenting at Changban Slope in the Fifth Watch" is clear, melodious, and uniquely original. Bao Lian Deng's old-style "erhuang" quick "sansanyan" style is unrestrained and directly approaches Shu Yan. His duet with Shang Xiaoyun in "Qiu Hu Teasing His Wife" is excellent in both singing and delivery. Yan Jupeng’s "Zhu Lian Village" has a voice like metal and stone, showing considerable skill. Tan Xiaopei and Luo Wenkui’s "Selling the Horse" features close and seamless dialogue. Shang Xiaoyun's "Teaching the Son" has a beautiful voice that is naturally endowed, making her excel in her field. "Xiangsi Village Persuading Farming" presents new arias in succession, flowing and pleasing to the ear. Xue Yanqin and Tan Fuying’s duet in "Visiting the Mother in the Palace" shows Xue excelling in sweetness and charm, while Tan is distinguished by his aged voice. It can be said that both are beautiful. Xue Yanqin and Xiao Changhua’s "Su San Escorted Under Guard" features one with flavorful melodies and the other with authentic Beijing dialect. Du Liyun’s "Hibiscus Sword" and Yu Shuang’s "Scolding the Palace" can be said to achieve the same result through different paths. The quick "sansanyan" style in "Yu Tang Chun Visiting the Prison" has never been seen on records before. Liyun’s unconventional approach is also novel and appealing. Jin Shaoshan and Ma Fulu’s duet in "Fa Men Temple" and "Investigating the Underworld" feature both singing and dialogue that are majestic and decisive. In terms of structure, it has reached the pinnacle. Li Duokui’s "Ganlu Temple" and "Beheading the Son" capture the essence of Gong. Drum King Liu Baoquan’s two pieces "Bowang Slope" and "Xu Mother Scolds Cao" have a generous style and full energy. Bai Yunpeng’s "Daiyu Returns to Heaven" and "White Emperor City" are both graceful and majestic. Lao Wagua’s "Awakening Golden Bell" and Zhang Ye’er’s "Four Teachings Song" are full of humor and vividly expressive. They are worthy of the title of the two great comedians of the North and South. Other pieces include Wang Caiyun's ditties, Shen Jian’an and Xue Xiaoqing’s "Pearl Pagoda," Liu Cuixia, Li Yufen and Wen Jinfang’s "B繃調," Ms. Hu Zhou Shuan and Ms. Bao Yongzhen's new-style songs, German military drills, Russian boatmen's songs, etc. The singers put their whole spirit into it, and the recording is clear and accurate, making them all beautiful and pleasing to the ear, catering to the preferences of record fans.</p>

<h3>Travels in India (80)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>Since yesterday, the newspapers have reported that Gandhi and the government have reached an understanding and will cease all non-cooperation movements. The government's condition is to convene a national conference. I asked someone about this matter: Can Gandhi actually cancel the various movements? The person said that this is Gandhi's strategy, taking a temporary break to convene a national conference for a grand promotion. If the conference is not to his liking at that time, he will break again, and their collective strength will be greater. Gandhi has spent much of his life in prison, once for six years and once for four years, a total of five or six times. It is no wonder that he has no smile on his face and often cries. Gandhi's revolution is an inward revolution. Alas, it can be said to be difficult. Whether it will succeed, I do not know. Yesterday, monks gave lectures and reports on the situation of physical beauty, mentioning Gandhi's name more than ten times in one session. It can be said that the entire Indian nation thinks of Gandhi like the Chinese think of Amitabha Buddha.</p>
<p>Confucius once said, "Is man really inferior to birds?" It is easier to be a bird than to be a man. The great difference between the Indian and Islamic religions is that Islam forbids eating pork, while India forbids eating beef. Both are forbidden items. However, in the year 743 AD, there was an Islamic king named Walid II, who scorned the Quran, openly ate pork, drank alcohol, and did not pray. In that same year, an Indian religious saint named Guru Nanak Saheb created a new sect, harmonizing Islam and India, gathering people from both religions to form a new sect. There were charitable people in Islam who also agreed with his prohibition of eating beef and inclined towards him. Later, his disciples gained considerable influence and clashed with the [other] sect, resulting in many mutual killings. Even today, there are still 70,000 followers, forming a new sect. When they fought each other, the Indians also deliberately used pig bones to resist them. One pig and one cow have become major problems in West and Central Asia and India. It is like the Manchus entering the customs, causing countless deaths because of a single queue [hairstyle]. In the religious wars of the Middle Ages, countless people were killed because of a single idol. Now, Marx wants to solve it with a single materialistic history, but it seems not easy. If you live among Indians and Muslims for a long time, you will know that many problems are mostly due to the differences in religious habits, beliefs, and customs, and are not material problems. Even the prohibitions on pork and beef have nothing to do with material things. What can be done about it? If it were in Egypt, cats would also become a major problem because ancient Egypt had a punishment for killing cats. The punishment was very severe, almost equal to killing a person. It is not easy to be a human being in different customs in different places.</p>

<h3>Woman, Woman (19)</h3>
<p>— Yao Su Feng</p>
<p>When Xiao Rong’s wife heard that they had already returned to Shanghai, she felt very sad, but there was nothing she could do, so she reluctantly went home. How would she know that Xiao Rong had only moved to another hotel?</p>
<p>When she returned home, the more she thought about it, the more uneasy she became, and the more she worried. She felt that she had to find Xiao Rong and ask him herself. Therefore, she came up with a plan and decided to go by herself. At that time, she discussed it with her father-in-law and mother-in-law, and everyone thought this method was good. So, after she inquired about and firmly remembered the address of the school where Xiao Rong was studying, she took some travel expenses and rushed to Shanghai alone, regardless of everything.</p>
<p>On this day, Xiao Rong had been accompanying Miss Ding in Suzhou for two days and was a bit tired of playing. Moreover, Xiao Rong was often worried that perhaps more unfortunate things would find him, so he told Miss Ding that he wanted to return to Shanghai. Miss Ding did not object.</p>
<p>After Xiao Rong’s wife arrived in Shanghai, she hired a rickshaw and went straight to Xiao Rong’s school according to the address she had remembered. She asked the doorman, "Is there a student here named Lu Rongqing from Suzhou?"</p>
<p>"Lu Rongqing! Yes, there is! He is not in school now!" The doorman looked at the sign hanging on the wall and answered like this.</p>
<p>"Then where did he go? Will he come back tonight?" She asked again.</p>
<p>"That, I don't know!"</p>
<p>She had no choice but to sit and wait at the school gate. Her only hope was that she could meet Xiao Rong when he returned to school. But one hour, two hours passed, and it was already eight o'clock in the evening, and she was still disappointed. However, she still patiently waited without leaving. The doorman also felt surprised and asked her, "Do you have any urgent business with Lu Rongqing? You can just tell me, and I can pass it on to him. If you keep waiting for him, you might not see him for days! Because it’s summer vacation now."</p>
<p>She still did not leave, thinking about her own future, she could not help but shed a few tears in secret. It was not until ten o'clock when the school gate was about to close that she had no other way to stay here, so she had to leave disappointed and find a small hotel to stay nearby.</p>
<p>She could not sleep all night and cried several times. As soon as it dawned, she immediately rushed to Xiao Rong’s school.</p>
<p>"Has Lu Rongqing returned?" she asked.</p>
<p>"No!" the doorman replied in surprise. So, she still sat on the chair at the school gate and waited.</p>
<p>Many students who were going in and out saw such a sad-faced woman sitting at the school gate, and everyone began to inquire about it. It happened that Li Wenyao came to the school that day, and everyone talked about this matter.</p>

<h3>Calm Seas for Bullion Trading</h3>
<p>Fluctuating within the 75 Taels Mark  Yesterday, the 13th, the bullion market seemed to be softening, but the seas were calm, fluctuating within 775 taels. The overall market difference was only a few taels. As a result, there was a slight drop. The trading volume among dealers was mixed, but there were no large transactions. Although the silver price rose, it withered as soon as it opened. The foreign exchange market was quite stable, with a slight upward trend in the future. The market was even more sluggish, with fluctuations of only one or two taels. As the settlement date approaches, many parties are still willing to post [margin].</p>
<p>Opening Slightly Lower  The September contract opened slightly lower in the morning, down 2.2 taels, at 771.5 taels. The spot market remained unchanged. The silver price rose by one-eighth in both public and private telegrams. Although US stocks fell, it did not cause any movement. Next, it was 1.2 taels. Wanxing Shunli Goods and other firms took the lead in selling. Soon, Tong Taichang Zhifeng Yong and others bought in, immediately raising the price by 3 taels to 74.5 taels. At the same time, the Japanese bank absorbed 5,625 September British pounds, then offset 5,625. Hengyu, Richang, Dadecheng, and others sold, dropping 4 taels to only 70 taels and 6 qian. Suddenly, Zhengjin bought 625 November contracts, adding 2 taels. At 9:30, the British pound was unchanged, standing at 73 taels and 3 qian. In a moment, it dropped to 2.3 taels. Zhifeng Yong Yuanmao Yong and other arbitrageurs bought in, so it rose again, reaching 75 taels at 9:50. Then, Zhifeng Yong and Dalian Gang sold, and British pounds could be settled at 5,625, retreating another 3 taels to 71 taels and 8 qian at 10:30. After that, Chunyuan Yong and Dadecheng bought in, raising the price again by more than 2 taels to 74 taels and 2 qian at 11:00. However, there were still many short positions, reaching 71 taels and 8 qian at 1:30. Suddenly, news of a small Indian exchange rate was reported, and it rose to 3.5 taels. However, the forward rate was large, so it went down again, and Tong Taichang also sold on the market. It continued to fall to 71 taels and 2 qian. Qian Changxiang and Goods came in to buy, and the market closed at 72 taels and 9 qian, then rose again to more than 3 taels. The announced price was still 819 taels, a discount of 46-47 taels.</p>
<p>Mediocre Afternoon  The afternoon market opened at 72 taels and 6 qian, then fell from 3.3 taels to 2.1 taels. Transactions were few. Afterwards, it advanced and retreated around 73 taels. After 3:30, the Indian exchange rate dropped by 3 annas, and Neixing bought in, suddenly rising by more than 1 tael, reaching 74 taels and 3 qian at almost 4 o'clock. The entry was small, and the foreign exchange was extremely stable. At 4:10, it was 73 taels, adding another 2 or 3 qian. When the market closed at 4:30, it was 73 taels and a half. Suddenly, Tong Taichang and Richang sold, but the market softened, dropping 2 taels in a moment to only 71 taels, 7 or 8 qian. Compared to the previous day (according to the listed price), it only dropped 2 qian. According to the largest price of 75 taels and the smallest price of 70 taels and 6 qian, there was a fluctuation of 4 taels and 4 qian.</p>
<p>Slightly Smaller Spot Premium  The morning market spot was 1.3 taels, the midday closing was 3.5 taels, the afternoon was 3.5 taels, and the closing price was 3 taels. The announced discount was 46-47 taels to more than 45 taels. The recorded price was 71 taels to 73 taels, and the settlement price was 71 taels to 72 taels. The spot premium was slightly smaller, with an increase of 10 taels. Yingfeng Heng sold to Tianjin Gang nearly 1,700 taels of both forward and spot contracts, and also bought 100 taels. However, there were very few goods arriving from other ports, so the price was able to remain stable.</p>
<p>No Large Transactions  There are no transaction statistics on the trading floor. Yuanmao Yong, Dadecheng, Tong Taichang, Wanxing, Shunli, and Qian Changxiang all bought more than they sold.

<h3>Daily Interest Remains Active</h3>
<p>Market Overview  The current trend of foreign interest rates is that customer demand is sluggish, and the local demand for cash is also weak. Therefore, it has never been aggressive. The reason why it was slightly better yesterday was that the market participants mutually settled in and out of the foreign exchange market. If the next day the head-fitting compensation is still sufficient, then this high price will definitely return to normal. The demand for capital is indeed more lively than in the summer, but it has not yet reached its peak, so it is still mediocre.</p>

The Guangdong small silver coins were 6 qian 4 fen 4 li 2 hao and a half in the early market and 6 qian 4 fen 4 li and a half in the afternoon market, an improvement of half a li compared to the previous afternoon. The transaction volume was 155,000 jiao in the early market and 60,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by another 1,000, to 379,000 wen, with a transaction volume of more than 33,000 strings.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cotton Flower Market Trends Diverge</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the afternoon after falling in the morning. The trend remained chaotic, and the changes were quite rapid. However, the price of American cotton continued to fall slightly, so there were still many sellers. In the afternoon, it was reported that the US Department of Agriculture would abandon collecting one-third of the US cotton crop. As a result, market sentiment was greatly shaken, and the situation changed abruptly. The buying interest was tense, and the prices for all months jumped by more than two taels. Later, a major player sold, and the closing price slightly recovered. Most people predicted that the price of American cotton might rise again, so the market atmosphere was very tight. The Rongxing Company continued to buy and increase its position, and the amount was still huge. However, the actual situation was not good.</p>
<p>People's Standard Cotton Fell in Morning and Rose in Afternoon  The People's Standard Cotton market opened in the previous session. Due to the poor condition of American cotton, the market was very weak, and the prices fell by 5.6 qian to 2.47 qian. In the afternoon, the price of American cotton rose sharply by more than two taels due to news. Later, due to pressure from major players, it fell by a few qian. The transaction volume was 88,350 bales. It was found that Gongtai sold 1,200 bales, Ruidai 4,200 bales, Dafu 2,000 bales, Gengfeng 2,650 bales, Yiyu 1,550 bales, Xinhua 1,400 bales, and Xincheng 4,150 bales.

<h3>Cotton Market Improves in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially declined then improved, but foreign cotton remained sluggish, and gold prices softened. Moreover, overseas surpluses caused unease, leading to a hesitant sentiment. However, in the afternoon, news from the U.S. Agricultural Administration suggested a one-third reduction in U.S. cotton production. Whether this proposal will materialize remains uncertain. Market sentiment tightened sharply, and buying interest surged, causing prices to soar by five or six cash. However, major players continued to sell, indicating a lack of confidence in the cotton market's future.</p>
<p>Hankow Standard Benefits from U.S. Cotton News. The opening price for Hankow Standard was down four, eight, and five cash due to the continued weakness in the global cotton market and hesitant sentiment.

<h3>Proposal to Destroy One-Third of U.S. Cotton</h3>
<p>Washington, 12th. The Department of Agriculture sent letters to the governors of the 14 cotton-growing states, proposing to destroy one-third of the new cotton crop. If the states can assist in implementing this, the U.S. government will withhold its 1.3 million bales of stored cotton from the market in the following year. According to the government's estimate on August 8, cotton production will reach (15,584,000 bales). The carryover at the end of July was (9,130,000 bales), and the government-stored cotton was (1,300,000 bales), totaling (26,014,000 bales). If one-third of the new cotton crop can be destroyed and the Department of Agriculture withholds its stored cotton, the U.S. cotton supply would be approximately (19,500,000 bales).</p>
<p>Additionally, if ten major states accept the proposal to destroy one-third of U.S. cotton, it may be implemented.</p>
<h3>Rice Market in Zhabei Plunges by One Yuan</h3>
<p>The Nanshi Market Temporarily Stabilizes</p>
<p>Nanshi: Supplies from various groups remained limited due to morning wind resistance. Supplies only started arriving around 10:00 AM, including shipments from Tonglibei, Lili Liantang No. 4, and Nangang No. 3 and 4, Pinghu No. 22 and 23. Limited volume was traded. Special Chang Geng opened at 18.9 yuan, with other grades priced accordingly. Although the supply of foreign rice was not large, the demand from customers and local merchants seemed deterred by the high prices, leading to a slight softening. The market appeared weak.</p>
<p>Zhabei: The supply from the west road remained strong, but trading in the local market became increasingly sluggish. Although nearly a thousand piculs of Bo Dao and Early Rice were offered, prices plunged by about one yuan. Su Chang Bai Geng and Kunshan rice each fell by 7 or 8 jiao. There was little interest in Lu Yang Jian and Bu Jian. The downstream outlook was weak. Limited quantities of glutinous rice arrived. Although liquor merchants were interested, local sales were not strong. The market opened half a yuan lower. Nearly one hundred piculs of new Geng arrived, jointly purchased by Yuchen Tai and Hesheng, but no transactions were completed.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Red Sugar Continues to Offer Over 2,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday's telegrams from sugar-producing areas indicated that the price of Cuban spot sugar remained unchanged. New York sugar futures for December fell by one point, while May futures for next year rose by one point. Other months showed no changes. Java spot sugar also remained unchanged. There were few transactions in the public market due to sluggish sales, but sentiment remained firm. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white new goods were priced at 11 taels and 5.5 qian, No. 20 medium granulated white at 11 taels and 0.05 qian, finely ground granulated white at 11 taels and 6.5 qian, Dutch red sugar No. 8/9 at 9 taels and 4 qian, bowl blue at 8 taels and 7.5 qian.

Huaxin offered over 2,000 bags of spot Dutch red sugar No. 8/9, priced at 9 taels and 4.5 qian. Demand was strong, and all were sold, indicating a vibrant market.</p>
<h3>Wufu White Ice Price Increases</h3>
<p>Due to hot weather, the Xiamen factory had temporarily stopped production of Wufu white ice, resulting in a scarce supply and low inventory. Recently, limited quantities have been released at a price of 8 taels and 9 qian. According to the factory's telegram, due to rising raw material costs, they plan to increase the price of stored ice by two or three qian before releasing it. Therefore, the market is holding firm, refusing to sell unless the price increases.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: 30 Bundles of Summer Cocoon Silk Shipped to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>This year, the cocoon harvest in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was poor, with few high-quality cocoons. The summer cocoons produced in Wuxi and other places are only suitable for the domestic silk market. Due to the demand for winter silk, silk merchants have purchased a significant amount of summer cocoon silk from Shanghai factories. Yesterday, 30 bundles were shipped to Hangzhou by the Shanghai-Hangzhou train, purchased by Weicheng Silk Factory as futures contracts.</p>
<h3>Factory Yarn Sales Sluggish to Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of foreign factory yarn in Shanghai remained sluggish. Currently, domestic silk weaving factories are preparing for their summer holidays. Although they are interested in yellow and white factory yarn, they find the prices too high. Telegram orders have been scarce. Yesterday, only Lianna imported 10 bales of Shanghai white factory yarn, Xinfu imported 15 bales of Shandong yellow factory yarn, and Meida imported 10 bales of yellow coarse silk. Prices remained firm.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, tea merchants from various origin areas showed strong interest in Zhenmei Da Bang green tea from Lai Lu Zhuang, including Yingzhuang, Yihua, Xiehe, Jinlong, and Tianxiang. The market for tea from Wudong, Shexian, and Sui'an was particularly active, with prices soaring by 10 to 20 taels. The prices of tea from Tunxi and Wubei also showed no signs of declining. The Russian Assistance Association has shown great interest in Gongxi, but recently, Baitouzhuang and Huacha Company have been taking the opportunity to acquire the tea. Chinese merchants are holding firm, unwilling to lower prices for sales.</p>

<h3>Death of French Satirical Cartoonist Forain</h3>
<p>— Yue Lun</p>
<p>A great loss to the art world recently is the death of the renowned French satirical cartoonist Forain. I regret not being able to immediately travel to Paris to lay a wreath before his spirit. I have specially penned this short article to introduce this deceased artist to fellow art enthusiasts, as a way to mourn him.</p>
<p>At midnight on Friday, the streets of Paris were still bustling. It was at this time that the famous Forain passed away. Accompanying him in death was only his virtuous wife. The patient's moans suddenly turned into cries of grief. The surroundings of the house were filled with a desolate atmosphere. All that remained were the artist's lifetime of work and the few sketches by the artist he admired, Danmier Corat, hanging on the wall.</p>
<p>Forain was born in October 1852. At the age of sixteen, he began studying sculpture under Carpeaux, aspiring to become a sculptor in the future. At the same time, he hoped to achieve greatness in history. It is said that great figures in history often have eccentricities or behaviors that ordinary people consider "strange." Forain was no exception. Consider, Forain was studying sculpture, so why did he later become a famous satirical cartoonist? The story behind this is quite interesting. It turns out that the artist became a painter entirely because of being wrongly accused, which suddenly changed the direction of his studies. It was completely an accidental and unexpected encounter. The story is like this: once, the class monitor unfortunately committed a serious blunder, damaging the right hand of a statue of the Crown Prince made by the teacher's family. The class monitor, fearing punishment, falsely accused Forain of the damage. The teacher, enraged, did not investigate the truth of the matter and abruptly expelled the innocent student from his sculpture studio.</p>
<p>The sudden injustice to the young artist caused him to lose his place of study. Naturally, he felt extremely indignant. As a result of this indignation, he abandoned his original ambition and shifted his interest to the practice of satirical painting. Later, he became the most authoritative satirical cartoonist in modern France. Throughout history, artists or other great figures have often been motivated by injustice to strive in other directions, leading to the creation of great and immortal works or careers. History is full of such examples. Take Qu Yuan of China, for instance. If it weren't for the "senior officials" who "vied for favor" with him and spoke ill of him before King Huai, causing him to be alienated, perhaps our poet would have been an official his entire life and died as such. Where would we have the "Li Sao," passed down for thousands of years, for later generations to recite? From this perspective, perhaps the making of great artists and other great figures requires stimulation. During the European war, our artist served as a soldier, charging into battlefields against the enemy. He even received the Croix de Guerre for his war exploits. Castelman said, "His bravery and will can serve as a model for soldiers."</p>
<p>Speaking of Forain's painting, he is a modern French satirical painting authority, and won the Legion of Honor (La Commandent de la Region I'bonnens). He served as the president of the Satirical Association. In 1923, he was elected as a member of the Academy of Fine Arts, and the chairman of the National Fine Arts Association jury. The British Royal Institute of Oil Painting has hired the director as an honorary member. Fifre, Paris World (Monde' Parisiene), Figaro, French News (Ｃotrier Francaise), Paris Tide (Ech de Paris) Paris Life (La ViaParisien), Journal and other newspapers and magazines often have Forain's works.</p>
<h3>The Spanish Literary World After the Success of the Revolution</h3>
<p>— Chun</p>
<p>Literature is often the fuse of revolution; this saying is often proven true. Although a considerable number of people oppose the instrumentalization of literature, in a time of emergency, this kind of consciousness cannot be suppressed. The inspiration of writers cannot be immune to the objective social environment, and the people's need for a reasonable life is naturally expressed more urgently in literature. The successful conclusion of this Spanish republican revolution is, of course, no exception. We only need to look at the famous novelist Vicente Blasco Ibáñez's efforts in the revolutionary movement, advocating revolution everywhere, and the powerful exposure and stimulation of revolutionary consciousness in his novels, all of which are enough to prove the Spanish literary world's madness and enthusiasm for the revolutionary movement. Unfortunately, Ibáñez died in exile due to failure, eventually dying in France, without seeing the success of the revolution. However, in recent years, due to the high tide of the revolutionary movement, many people other than Ibáñez have been drawn into the vortex of practical political activities in the Spanish literary world.</p>
<p>The successful establishment of the Spanish Republic has manifested a new life in its political system, and it has also had an extraordinary impact on the literary world. Here, I don't want to talk about the transformation of theory or even the issue of providing goods. What I want to bring up is that after the establishment of the republican government, it immediately dispatched a group of literary writers to serve as ambassadors or ministers to various countries. This is truly unprecedented and perhaps a pioneering initiative, as important countries have almost all been occupied by them. I don't think other countries have appointed diplomats in this way. It is inevitable that this will arouse the envy of the literary world in various countries.</p>
<p>Now, I will write down the names of the people I know below:</p>
<p>1. Novelist, essayist, and poet Ramón Pérez de Ayala, stationed in England.</p>
<p>2. Salvador de Madariaga, famous for popular novels and the most well-known writer in Spain, stationed in the United States.</p>
<p>3. Grejorio Marañón, known for his research on the psychology of the sexes, stationed in France.</p>
<p>4. Renowned philosopher Leso Grttgay Gasset, stationed in Germany.</p>
<p>5. Critic Azorín (real name José Martínez Ruiz), stationed in Argentina.</p>
<p>6. Novelist Smerica Casro, stationed in Cuba.</p>
<p>7. Novelist Miguel de Unamuno, stationed in Cuba.</p>
<p>8. Journalist and novelist Luis Araguistain, stationed in Greece.</p>
<p>9. Historian Rapael de Altamito, stationed in Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>10. Federico Gorcia Sancbez, whose travelogue novels are rich in both quality and quantity, stationed in Japan.</p>

<h3>Louis Lewis Doesn't Want the Medals Anymore</h3>
<p>Not long ago, Louis, who had just won the Nobel Prize and was made a laughingstock in the literary world for being slapped in the face, recently lost his temper again and actually wanted to donate the gold medal to Yale University's New Sterling Memorial Library. However, the school authorities treated it indifferently and made no response, which made Louis feel embarrassed and in an awkward position. It is said that this is due to some misunderstanding that has not yet been resolved. Louis can be said to be the unluckiest Nobel Prize winner. (Chun)</p>
<h3>The Revival of Portrait Painting</h3>
<p>Portrait painting has been largely neglected by the French in the past twenty years, but now there is a trend of revival. Recently, a large-scale exhibition of historical portraits was held in Paris. The purpose of this exhibition is to attract people's attention to portrait painting and to inspire painters to turn to portrait painting and promote the revival of portrait art.</p>
<h3>Guidelines for Art Articles</h3>

<h3>Marshal Foch's Diary of the European War</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>Therefore, each army must study the organization of the enemy's rear, to determine whether the enemy has a retreating action, and must always strictly scout the enemy's situation, whether there is a retreating pattern, and must also prepare to pursue, so as to avoid the enemy army having the opportunity to retreat completely.</p>
<p>On July 24th, when the victorious battle in the Tetun area was underway, the Allied commanders-in-chief—Marshal Haig, General Pétain, and General Pershing—gathered at my headquarters in Ponpon to study future plans with me. I asked my Chief of Staff, General Weygand, to read the aforementioned plan to them. The commanders-in-chief seemed startled by the ambition, scope, and frequency of operations in this plan.</p>
<p>The commanders-in-chief gave their respective answers based on their different positions:</p>
<p>Marshal Haig - The British army has been almost completely disintegrated after the battles of March and April, and it will take time to recover.</p>
<p>General Pétain - The French army has been exhausted after four years of fierce fighting, and the soldiers are all suffering from anemia.</p>
<p>General Pershing - The only mission of the American army is to fight, but the American army has not yet been formed.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, how can our army consider adopting a continuous large-scale offensive?</p>
<p>While acknowledging the rationality of the commanders-in-chief's observations, I insisted on my point of view. I had paid considerable attention to the temporary weaknesses of each army, but I also expected that the proper combination of our army would be sufficient to make the planned implementation possible. In particular, our army can implement it flexibly. What I mean is to determine the speed and slowness of the implementation of this plan based on the current degree of victory.</p>
<p>The commanders-in-chief did not formally express their opposition. When they left me, they each took a copy of the July 24th plan. The next day, they each expressed their agreement in principle. (To be continued)</p>
