<h3>馬寅初對於錢莊法之意見</h3>
<p>二十五日在立法院紀念週報告院長各位委員各位同志今天院長命本席報告、本席若將經濟委員會和商法起草委員會、零零碎碎修正各法案的工作、報告出來、覺得是很乾燥無味的、所以現在把關於錢莊法的問題、報告一下、自從銀行法頒布以後、一般錢莊業、以爲他們是附屬於銀行了、因此表示不大滿意、希望另定錢莊法、後來就由上海錢莊業發起、提出這個意見、各地錢莊業團體、也有電報響應、現在經本席把這個問題、研究一下、認爲他們所提出的理由、比較重要的、約可分爲八點、（一）錢莊是靠信用、銀行是靠抵押、（二）按照銀行法的規定、資本太大（三）錢莊業應准其獨資經營、（四）銀行法第九條的規定、錢莊不能適用、（五）財産證明書一層、認爲在中國是很困難的、（六）對於百分之二十的保證金問題、也認爲辦不到、（七）不願意受財政部的檢查、並不必造具資産負債表損益計算書等以便公告、（八）營業時間、不能限制、關於以上這八點、我們大致可以分别研究一下、第一點他說錢莊是做信用放欵、銀行是做抵押放欵、其實並不盡然、兄弟在銀行界、亦曾做過事情、曉得有些銀行、并不一定專以抵押放欵爲主、也有做信用放欵的甚至幾十萬的、放欵子也有没有抵押品的、至於錢莊放欵、也不是完全靠信用、有許多也要抵押品的、如抵押透支等、都是這個樣子、所以若說銀行是專靠抵押放欵、錢莊專做信用放欵的話、是不然的就如北平各銀行、有許多做信用放欵的、漢口銀行也是這個樣子、所以分開來說、若是認爲銀行一定以抵押放欵爲主、錢錢莊業一定以信用放欵爲主、事實上也是不然的、還有一層、假定銀行是靠抵押爲主、錢行是靠信用爲主、然而所謂信用放欵的辦法、究竟將來要不要存在、也</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>是一個問題、并且遇着經濟恐慌的時候、恐怕就要發生危險、平常雖然很靠得住的商人、到了這個恐慌時候、就有了問題了、所以信用放欵的辦法、在銀行和錢莊方面、都是不應該存在的、但是我們爲遷就事實起見、在銀行法中、並不絕對禁止信用放欵、不過稍加限制而已、至於錢莊業希望另定錢莊法、不按公司的組織、仍按合夥的組織、這一層也很有問題、比如上海的習慣、我們知道大凡合夥組織的錢莊、表面上雖是負無限責任、而實際上講起來、他們呌作分擔無限責任、假定一個錢莊、有五個東家、這個錢莊、生意、因爲虧空一百萬倒了、那末就應該每人拿出二十萬元來、倘或有四個人拿不出來、只有一個人有錢·旣是無限責任、就應由他一個人負連帶無限責任、拿出一百萬來才對、至於他們五個人如何解决、這是内部的問題、可是他們這種分擔無限責任則不然、只是這個人拿出二十萬來、彌補他分擔的虧空就算了事、其餘八十萬、便無着落、這種辦法、是很不對的、他們平常在表面上、對外說是負無限責任、但是一倒、就只負分擔無限責任了由這一點事實上看起來、錢莊一倒、則對外債務、就很難清理的、因爲所謂無限責任簡直的變成了招牌、所以去年我們制定公司法的時候就没有承認他們這種辦法、不主張有分擔無限責任的規定、應該照公司法的組織、一定要負連帶責任的以便一方面可以保護資本家、一方面也可以保護存欵人及其餘的債權人、須知立法者一面須顧到資本主、一面也須顧到存欵人與其他債權人的安全、我們立法、不應專重資本主、而對於資本主之對方、亦不能不兼顧及之但向我們說話者是資方我們不能專憑顧及之、但向我們說話者是資方、我們不能專憑資方一面之詞來立法資方之對手方因無組織、没有向我們說話之機關、我們不能因他們無組織、便將他們受法律保護的權利都犧牲了、且從前上海本來有一百幾十家錢莊、到了辛亥那年、倒了好幾十家、後來交易所閙風潮的時候、又倒了幾十家、在橡皮風潮的時候、不知倒了多少家、現在廣東的錢舖子、差不多只要拿出四五千元來、就可以作生意、專以買賣港紙爲大宗、有時並引起中央銀行的鈔票擠兌風潮、他們就可以藉此機會、操縱一切對於正當買賣、反不作了、對於債權人之利益、更不關心廣東省政府主席陳銘樞、於是用快刀斬亂麻的手段、取締他了、要他們増加資本額、否則不不准營業、我們再看内地的小錢莊、和一般人民是有直接利害關係的、所以我們不但要保護錢莊、而且還要保護與錢莊有關係的人、那末無論按照法律或習慣、旣是一樣的負無限責任、爲甚麽不可以照公司法的規定、改爲無限公司組織呢現在有人主張、敎我們把銀行法修正爲金融法、把銀錢業就都包括在内、這一層可否採取、還待討論、至於第二點所謂資本太大一層、本來上海的錢莊業、多是在二十萬以上的、不過内地的錢莊業、資</p>
<p>本很小、有十萬八萬的、也有四萬五萬以下的、現在他們覺得銀行法規定的無限公司組織、其資本至少不得在五萬元以下一層、似乎太高、有主張減少者、這一層我們並不堅持、兄弟本人並没有一定的成見、第三點他們主張可以獨資經營、我們以爲不很妥當、要曉得錢莊是和各方面都有關係的、譬如錢莊發出來票、是人</p>
<p>人要用的、故錢莊與其他生意不同、比如我開</p>
<p>了一個書店、專賣敎科書、祗和學生有關係、和學生以外的人並没有甚麽關係、錢莊可就不然了、因爲他出的票子、與各個人都有關係、若是准其獨資經營、實在是危險很多、現在外國對於獨資經營、已經慢慢的取締、都改爲公司的組織了、在日本則更進一層所有銀錢業、都須照股份有限公司組織、至於第四點、是銀行法第九條所規定的附屬業務、於錢莊不適用、我們看不出爲甚麽不適用、豈錢莊不買賣生金銀及有價證券嗎、豈錢莊不代理收付欵項嗎、至於第五點要錢莊股東出具財産證明書一層、要請各位委員討論、鄙人的意見、以爲負無限責任的</p>
<p>股東、在投下該錢莊的資本以外、如果還有財産、任到何處、都不能不負其責任、然而事實上若别無財産、則儘管說是無限責任、也不過空口說白話、所以必須要證明其財産、否則窮盜蛋都</p>
<p>可以負無限責任了、於社會何等危險、所以財産的證明書與無限責任連帶而來的、二者不能分離、第六點關於百分之二十的保證金亦應請各位委員公决、至於第七點的請求、最没有道理、他們的意見、不僅不要受財政部的檢查、且不要造具各種報告、眞是無理取閙、我們决不能准他這個要求、還粗第八點、是營業時間的問題、按照銀行法的規定、雖是自上午九時至十二時、下午一時至四時、不過還有一個但書、是但因營業上之必要得延長之、這樣看起來、並不是勉勉强强、一定要他們怎樣的遵守時間、就是延長到晚上也可以的、至百分之二十的保證金、他們反對存在中央銀行一節、須知銀行法關於這一點的規定、是爲防備營業破産保護社會安寗、才這樣規定、不過他們旣有認爲有問題、將來我們也可以研究一下（未完）</p>

<h3>支配絲業公債改良機器問題</h3>
<p>實業部與絲商意見不同最近發行之絲業公債、按照該項公債條</p>
<p>例第三條規定、以四分之一爲改良絲廠機器部分之用、現公債總額八百萬元、四分之一、應爲二百萬元、但此二百萬元之</p>
<p>支配辦法、雖經實業部與絲商方面、經兩席討論、迄未解决、且雙方爭執甚烈、茲探得實業部之改良計劃、及絲商方面之意見、分誌如下、</p>
<p>實部計畫據實業部司長程振鈞對新聲社發表絲業公債中改良絲廠機器二百萬元之用途、按照實業部擬定之計畫如下、（一）以全數二百萬元、撥交機器製造廠、專製新式繅絲機器、照原本出售、（二）以二百萬元開辦中央模範絲廠、一百萬元奬勵改良繅絲機器、其奬勵標準如下、</p>

<p>船身竟然傾覆昨日清晨十二時四十分、太古輪船公司浦東華通三號碼頭、忽發出高呼救命之</p>
<p>聲、接續不絕、時有海關水巡捕房七十三號華捕蘇金龍巡江經過、聞聲急切上前查察、見有一碼頭船翻覆浦面、並一男子立於船底上、據該男子自稱、係覆船上之老大共裝朱骨一百六十包、往卸張家浜碼頭、因黑夜停駛、並無大風巨浪、不知如何船身忽然傾覆、牛骨盡沉浦底、我眼快出險、尙有燒飯司務沉於船艙内等語、該捕聞言、急向鄰船取得利斧、將牛骨船船底砍開大洞、始將燒飯人救出、因爲時不多尙未溺斃、然無端覆舟、實一奇事、見者莫不咄咄稱奇、</p>

<p>專件</p>
<p>勞働我觀（再續）黃郛</p>
<p>在勞働大學演講詞今日也界各國之社會上、均有所謂勞資糾紛之說、勞働者對資本家之惟一口實、謂其勞力少而收穫多也、不知勞力眞少、妨拉資本家來參加</p>
<p>工作、收穫眞多、不妨令納重稅以興公益事業、不必因彼勞力少而收穫多、我亦希望勞力少而收穫多、减少工作時刻、勞力少也、増加工作薪水、收穫多也、不料勞働者欲打倒之人、而勞働者自身、先有被打倒者同一之心理、天下滑稽之事、寗有過此吾恐此勞力少收穫多之目的未達時、則打倒他人剛達到、即已易居被打倒者之地位、如此循環往復、人類尙　有安寗之日乎、果全人類而均逹到此目的吾敢斷言、勞力减少之日、即收穫絕滅之時、結果同歸於盡而已、吾爲此說、非謂正當之權利可以放棄也、惟彼此間之</p>
<p>要求、應衡量事實、大而國家之利益、小而本業之興　不可不顧及之、吾人對於人類社會、認爲只有所謂分工、所謂合作、本不主張競爭、惟世界上尙有所謂『獨立國家』之個體分别存在、故全人烦類社會之分工合作、尙未足以語此、（國際間利害相同之點、彼此分工合作之事亦不少、然未足以語其全）惟最少限度、在同一個體下之國民、應舉分工合作之實、蓋個不健全、决無餘惠足以旁及他人敬誤信外來引誘之詞、一量個體衰弱、手足無力、他人體内之消化器所攝得之營養品、無法使之分潤、以健吾手足、此最明顯之事實、三尺童足以了解之、故吾嘗謂當今之世、渾圓球上無無領屬之國圭土、即無無國籍之國民、民而冠以國字、可知民與國之關係、可須臾離、國民旣分四等、（並辈非四級、應注）意、曰士農工商、則必士爲國士、農爲國農、工爲國工、商、方足以固同一之個體、若但知吟風玩月、或持籌握算者、則謂之士商也可、謂之國士國商則不可、換言之、謂之民也可（無國之民亦民也）謂之國民則不可、由前所述、吾人對於勞働二字之解釋、可以得一結論、即吾人之身體、旣附屬於兩種本體之下而生存、不能不服從兩種本體之意志、（一）爲附屬於字宙之間之一生物、宇宙本體虽繼續不斷的變化、吾人應順此原則而勞働（二）爲附屬於國家之下之一國民、國家本體是希望分工合作、日進上軌的吾人應遵照此希望面勞働、至若勞働之方式、無論勞心勞力、間　運續、均可不計、但能各就其業、各盡其職可矣、</p>
<p>勞働二字之解秘、旣已得有結論、則吾人今日之演講、即可葴事、惟對學生諸程、尙欲供　一點微意、吾人今日演講詞中、引孔孟管子之言甚多、諸君或靨聞以爲老生常談、毫無興趣、不知宇宙旣繼續不斷的變化、是無常的、然一窺其變化之跡、則春夏秋科之序塞暑盡夜之分、年年如此、萬古不易、是極有常的、３所謂天之經也、宇宙變化、旣有經常之規則、則世界上寗有新奇之事、新奇之論、例如歐戰以後、歐人盛倡二語曰勞働神聖、曰簡單生活、一時因譯語不詳、逐視此爲最近世界新倡之名詞、量若有力宜探討之價値也者、實則勞働神聖者勤也、簡單生活者儉也、名異實同、初無含有特種之解釋、奇新之意義焉、蓋時不問古今、地不問中外、舉凡一切國家事業或個人事業之成就、與夫國家經濟或國民經濟之充裕、皆不外國民勤儉精社之所結晶、吾國古時、弟子必躬執洒掃、婦女必親操井白、而歷代先哲、又特親耕稼·習巡狩·以勸勤。菲飲食·薄宮·以示儉、凡所以訓練我國民、誘導我國民者、歷時至久、寓意至深、近代歐西物質文明東來、適値欠古敎漸弛、新德未修之際各都會間遂滔滔流入奢侈逸樂之途、而不知所屆、殊不知眞正之歐美文明、决不在輝煌奪目之舞塲、燦爛炫耀之飾品、而在其多數國民悉具有勤儉奮勵之眞精神、此不可不知者也、人類弱點、或有奸新奇之癖性、惟頼社會上富有天良之先覺、善爲誘導之、若爲一時方便計、处用人類弱點、好倡新奇之論、以迎合一時之人心、不獨誤盡青年、誤盡社會、結果亦必自殺、俗語脫得好、『晝鬼容蜴畫狗難、』因狗爲習見之物、所謂經也常也、脚過短、尾過長、人人得而批評之、鬼爲不可見之物、所謂新也奇也、三頭六臂、任意發揮、無人得而證明之、現在社會上頗有一部份不甚高明之畫家、『不能畫狗專畫鬼』諸君、宜『謹防見鬼、蓋以中國舊時之迷信言之（『見鬼决不是好』</p>
<p>事、還是講究講究忠信篤敬·克勤克儉·等老生常談、確實能使諸君終身受用不盡、並可促進國家或世界使達繁昌安寗之域、尤其是一在校期間一、實爲諸君一生或成或敗之最大分歧點、諸君負笈來滬、内離父兄、外多引誘、所可信托者、惟學校而已、允宜格外謹愼、且除遵守校規、專心學問、屏除外務、愼交師友以外、更當注意實習一層、若學農者、不願施肥、學工者不屑執斧、則每年内外各地成千累萬之畢業生、雖有專學、</p>
<p>却乏專技、社會上之實際需要、恐不如是、歐戰</p>
<p>以後、各國均提倡實用敎育、蓋學問原以致用爲歸、就軍事論、現在世界各國之軍事長官、無不經過一年或半載之兵士生活、就産業論、現在世界各國之工程師與技師、無不經過若干時期之職工生活、此則至可師法師法者也、本人生性拙直、願對人說眞話、寗願人駡我、不願我誤人、還請諸君原諒原諒、（完）</p>

<h3>决賽寫眞</h3>
<p>（一）湯史雷短跑稱王　　包辦百米二百四百第一中華锺連基周恩德何德寳成績亦佳美人湯史雷短離之怪傑身格健偉、勁力充滿</p>
<p>、起步得法、衝剌迅速、有茲四長、無怪包辦百米二百米四百米三項首席、而使我國锺連基周恩德何德寳及托墨司基等相顧失色望塵莫及、三項成績、四百獨佳所得五十二秒五分二之時間</p>
<p>、平等我國劉長春創造之中國紀錄、是亦難能可貴、</p>
<p>百米槍聲之中、萬千視線、羣集於美之湯史雷一身、但見其一鼓作氣直登龍門、成績十一秒二、彼曾以打倒湯氏爲止標之托墨司基者、差一步、列第二、賽後握手致賀、甘心拜服、中華锺運基林光興二氏、前之五十米與首二兩名同在水平線上、高下之五十米、與首二兩名同在水平線上、高下之分、由於最後三十米衝刺之不如锺三、林四、陳國俊第五蔣鵬第六、</p>
<p>二百米周恩德林光興對於是項節目、抱有野心、鼓起全力與湯氏爭雄、步步緊隨、刻刻死跟、湯氏受此壓迫、自知非奮鬥難以見功、半途之第乃生變化、湯氏大刀闊斧之步驟、如駕風飛馳先周一步、衝破白線、林又後周一步、第四白乃特、第五勃萊鳥、成績二十三秒一、　　四百米開步未久、湯氏左腿被人踏傷、故初未有驚人之舉、曾榮忠乘勢加鞭、代領導羣雄至八十米之久、百米已屆、何德寳起而問鼎其時湯氏仍隱在三四名之後、令人奇駭不止、再進而至三百米時、湯氏稍見昂頭、又五十米、湯氏追出衆人之前、後四名皆係華人、恍如衆星棒月白線在望、湯氏兩腿有靈、轉眼而至、所蜊得成績五十二秒五分二、平等中國、賽後、因湯氏之傷、引起問題、久而久之、方行解决、大致事有來因、查無實據也、</p>

<p>（四）跳欄賽中華獨尊</p>
<p>陶英傑創造中欄全國紀錄高欄前列一二三四中華清一色　　高欄一向領導於高欄賽中之曹裕猝於最後上步之間、被陳國俊胸部一挺、觸破白線、名居第一、競爭劇烈成績遂佳、陳之十七秒時間、爲其本人最高之紀錄、曹列第二、可謂功虧一簣、談喜熹亦可兒乃不愼觸倒第三欄、從此不免驚心提膽、成績因是减色、落入第四、第三李文初竟能如我所望、居第三名、中華清一色之說、亦成事實、史璜克力不從心、大失所望、五人起跑、終居第五、其成績可知、</p>
<p>中欄陶英傑中欄六十秒成績、爲大會唯一之驚人紀錄、當報告員高聲宣告時、男女觀衆、齊起歡呼、陶氏行踪所至、掌聲隨之、欽拜英雄心理、固人人皆同、無分國際也、競賽五人、中國美一、陳寳球此中翹楚、乃落居第三、賽</p>
<p>因觸倒一欄之故、致後來速度、爲之減色、蓋恐犯規出塲、有害於大局也、獨一美人開霍弗、形勢尙佳民中間亦曾一度居先、因耐久力不足、人後稍緩、又乘陳之失機、乃得第二名、</p>
<p>（五）接力跑美國逞强</p>
<p>千六百米平等中國紀中華失敗於接棒失機實力相等　　八百米接力賽跑、非中即美、八百米一項、中美人才相等、冠軍更難預定、日人亦參列其間、否則似成單調也、第一不幸、美占内擋跑道、中在外擋、無形損失良巨、棒美人海爾與郝春德死力相爭、不料日人奇兵突出占居第二、海爾第一、郝氏第三、第二棒形勢突變、林光興一鼓作氣、居前領導、美國馬利奥第二、相差一米、第三棒周恩德接棒工夫良佳、占勢不少、美人白乃特雖見努力、終在周後、最後一棒、锺連基居五米之先、飛步進展、美名將湯史雷、果然身手出衆、最後三十米之間、遂漸追前、竟以一米之差破線、成績一分三十六秒華第二、日本第三、</p>
<p>（六）標槍日本拿手戲日本古川上擲標槍四五米一○昨居冠軍、馬出冷門、羣皆驚奇、實則標槍日本人之拿手戲遠東會日本人皆在六十米以上、昨日古川槍頭未準、如不斜出、正直飛去、定在五十米以上、賽時太陽旗風頭大健、五人全部成績如下、</p>

<h3>記馮君木先生</h3>
<p>— 貞一</p>
<p>慈谿馮君木先生。文名滿天下。遽於五月十八日以腦疾不世。海内痛悼。其家人旣定六月工日爲先生設奠於慈谿故里。海上帮舊門人。不日擬假座寗波旅滬同鄉會追悼。用抒哀忱。從茲海上文人。又弱一個矣。</p>
<p>先生起靖極微。初僅覺手指麻木繼而延及周身。未幾病瘖。自起病至彌留。僅百二十日。疾未起時。甬上名醫范文甫偶來滬訪先生。既歸。馳書告友人曰。木公病危矣。其友大驚。职來滬省先生疾。見先生健飯如常。頗笑范君之妄。迨先生病殁。人始歎范君目光之遠故范君挽先生聨有『信庸醫多伏可死機。欲　死死矣』之語。實則先生病中亦自知不起。去歲盛省傳先生之殁。先生挽之有云。『痼疾纒綿。了無生趣。倘許從游入地、雖爲執鞭。所欣慕焉』時先生病冒。經名醫袁證道按摩。已將痊愈。此聨因病中不能握筆。囑門人魏友棐代書。旣發。先生忽覺聨語太蕭瑟。擬改之未果。不意竟成語讖也。</p>
<p>先生自來上海。文字應酬孔多。深覺爲苦。病起右腕病風。左腕尙能作反體書。曾爲王個簃先人題一像贊。蓋絕律筆也。</p>
<p>先生待人寬厚。不記人過。有門生某。乾没先生潤値、且反訾先生。人多不平。先生初不怒。但曰。其人當爲錢所迫。不得已而爲之耳。略不介懐。今先生往矣。吾人感念舊德。誠不覺涕泗之交頤也。</p>
<p>海内挽先生詩文聨甚多其門人洪荆山有五古　一章語極沈痛迻錄如後。逃空求空處。恒苦心魂馳。賃廡集賓萌。談笑掀鬚眉　。篇章苟慰荐。臺簡自持昪秉受固未充。辱如不勝衣。方寸頗澹定。妙論參詭辭。造述復多端。光怪拏蛟　。謁者樂晨夕。師亦與忘疲。欲歸歸未得。良爲疾所覊。一家課鷗夢。國内春熙熙　自冬被末疾。麻木日以羸。初非腹心患。徒聞呻吟悲。維師起孤意·崿崿苟揚姿。幼　儒效篇。與古若會期。輪囷負肝膽。其文淫以思。著聞朔南東。任俠聲瑰奇。自閱桑海後。講學春江湄。繄余慙師門。護落負所知。師性介夷惠。解嘲醒肝脾。愛余若　天性。抉摘不我欺。此材宜大用。兼善所所資。蹭蹬亦奚恤。天已昌其詩。借瑣耗奇氣。憂患亦隨之。遽聞病縣惙。涙如珠斷絲殺機酷芻狗。何乃及我師。郢人已喪質。惠子復何爲。決絕復決絕。質欵兮向誰。（不受酬）</p>
<h3>紹興嬰孩健康比賽會記</h3>
<p>— 高天棲</p>
<p>紹興縣立民衆敎育館。於五月廿三日及三十一日舉行嬰陔健康比賽會。報名二百十二人。與賽一百五十人。紹興舉行嬰孩伜健康比賽。此爲第一次。爰誌之以實自由談。</p>
<p>劃分階段　與賽嬰陔。劃分爲十二階段。自六個足月左右起。至實足六歲左右止。計每半歲爲一階段。參加嬰陔。以四歲以下各階段爲多。實足六歲者。僅有四人。</p>
<p>當選嬰孩　初賽每階段錄取三名。共得三十六人。複賽則由三十六人中選出總第一總第二總第三三名。結果總第一高淑梅。第二唐鑒行。第三王鍚驥。第一第二均爲女性。第三爲男性。查各地嬰孩比賽。優勝者每屬女性。實爲女權發逹之預兆。</p>
<p>笑啼並作　當磅體重及量身長時。年幼嬰孩。因怕見生人。多有啼哭者。而年齡較長之嬰孩。則滿塲奔跑。跳躍嬉笑。一時笑啼並作。熱鬧異常。</p>
<p>醫生會串　該會評判員。由醫生擔任。每階段一人。共須十二人。各醫院醫生。悉數邀請。尙不足數。於是保衛團軍醫。及法院法醫。亦被羅致。當評判會議時。某君謂此會可說全紹醫生大會串。合座爲之解頤。</p>
<p>滿載而歸　總第一高淑梅。即不侫之長女。實足年齡六十八個月體重四十七磅。身長三尺九寸半。爲全體嬰陔冠。初賽時。列十一階段第一名。複賽時。以九十六分點三獲總第一。獎品除由會贈金銀牌各一面。縣長贈鏡架一座外。並得糖果玩肯書籍鞋襪等數十件。滿載而歸途人均爲豔羡不置云</p>
<h3>談東瀛華俗</h3>
<p>今者中日兩國間。其民族之醒覺。與夫文化之發展。彼此軒輊。爲世人所共見。而無庸置辯者也。抑知日本咸取我國之風俗爲風俗風俗。竟以文明稱宇宙。而我國反落伍於　萬邦。豈有幸有不幸耶。回溯往昔。日人之醉心我國文明。有勝於今日之美利堅。以我國所有事物。爲唯一無上之珍品。當我國唐代中葉。道敎發逹。儒學昌盛。印度之文明。亦隨佛敎而輸故。我民族之政治国思想。因得有莫大之發展。斯時也。日本帝王。即遣臣來華。進求我國之禮儀風習。上行下效。樂焉相從。於是我國之風俗。遍行於蓬萊三島矣。迄今兩國民間之時令節日。以及附有之迷信習俗。雖歷千年。猶多雷同者。略舉若干。爲讀者告。</p>
<p>新年不灑水　日本習俗。自元旦至初五日。彼此互祝新禧。即父子兄妺。亦相道賀。商店掃地封不灑水。蓋以水爲財。積水。聚財意也。至我國以初五爲財神日。四日之夜。焚香燃燭。以迎財神。此後各商店。乃逐日開門。照常營業。此猶日本之『惠方詣』與『初荷』。惠方詣者。祀接歲德神。初荷者。延貴客而贈以商品也。</p>
<p>上已挿桃花　三月三日。我國文人。禊號三已。臨川蕩飲。日本雅士。亦有吟節句之風。至我鄉婦村婆。呼是日爲薺菜花生日。挿花鬚　。則主年中多進益。少貧困。日婦不過易菜花爲桃花。且約友結伴。遠足於河海之濱。與我同俗也。按曩昔西京附近。每逢是朝。有執桃茢驅邪之舉。則又與我鄭俗之執蘭招魂續魄。拔除不祥相似矣。</p>
<p>端節寫王字　扶桑每屆端節。門懸菖薄。傳說可免遭祝融之禍。婦女之腰。亦繫菖蒲。據云該項菖蒲。一經煎服。百病皆治。且午時飲菖蒲酒。以解體毒。其他如男兒之額書王字。背負小虎。（虎以布片製）皆類我俗。尙有懸加藤清正之五月人形。與我之懸鐘馗相同。端節景象。可謂畢肖。</p>
<p>中秋做　子　日人每屆中秋玉兎高昇之候。亦有焚香拜月之風。舞勺幼童。坐於庭前。或唱山歌。或啖瓜菒。我國有月餅以表彼時景色。日本亦有煑糰子乾芋等圓形之食物。取之賞月。俗稱月見糰子　　　　重九賞菊花　日人事花草。夙聞名於世界。重陽節日。各鄉皆會铭菊於一處。或黃或白。或紫或紅。以供騒客賞識。一如滬上小觀園大世界之菊花展覽會也。</p>
<h3>黃海環遊記（二五）</h3>
<p>— 黃炎培</p>
<p>吾們中國在這種環境之下。該怎樣呢。人家處心積慮。全國上下一致地謀我。——豈但日本。還有他國。我怎樣　能從重圍襄殺出一條血路來呢。看看内部又是這樣。</p>
<p>吾們慢說該怎樣怎樣。吾們先說不該怎樣怎樣。吾們先打倒三種心理。</p>
<p>第一。恐慌的心理。第二消極的心理。第三聽天由命的心理。</p>
<p>如果吾們還覺得吾們的土地是狠肥美的。物産是狠豐富的。基歴到現在還是狠好。病就在人的方面。而且人的生殖是狠繁盛的。姿質是狠聰明優秀的。僅僅屬於後天。而完全不在先天。那麽中國决不是不可爲的國家。還有什麽恐慌更何必消極常有一種青年。聽人家說到中途多麽危險。又看看中國現象。他越想越害怕了。越想越氣憤了。害怕和氣憤到了極點。竟會走到自殺的一條路上去。吾要對他說說中國是不會亡的。不過像你這種心理。倒是亡國的心理。吾還要對他說說你眞要死麽要是你眞不怕死。就把你這點不怕死的心理。擴大起來。就足够使得中國不亡。只看你什麽死法。</p>
<p>最是使不得的。就是聽天由命。無知識的聽天由命。也罷了。還聽得人家說。吾看國亡了以後。倒有辦法。這是什麽話呢。一九一九年朝鮮受了民族自决新思潮的影響。全國獨立運動。單是那年三月到五月死了七千五百多人。傷了一萬五千九百多人。被捕了四萬六千九百多人。到那年十月十一月間。又死了三千　零八十九人。（請看拙箸朝鮮第十三葉）總算死得不秒了。結果到底没有獨立。要使使在一九一○年亡　國以前。大家就給他一個不怕死。我敢斷言國就亡不掉。可惜那時候還在那衰鬧什麽黨。什麽派。直到國亡以後。拜爵新朝。還在那衷鬧某派若干人。某派若干人。（請看拙箸朝鮮第八十七至八十九葉）</p>

<h3>湖上偶談（四）</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>故蓴羹之製。當先以冷水漂淋。行水浴法。但去泥沙。勿去其滑澤之脂。置碗中。以掌遮誮護碗口。使水從指縫流去。則蓴凈而不失其眞。另以趨湯入火腿絲熬煑至沸。乃將火腿絲撈去不用。但用清湯勿使停沸。速以漂凈之　傾入湯中。則湯沸立停。即離火可食。香脆而滑嫩。清沁齒類。有非他物所能比　。閱耕餘錄謂。其略如魚髓蟹脂。而輕清遠勝。其亦無得當者。惟花中之蘭。果中之荔枝。差堪作配、然能知其味者。不過杭人。外客耳熟其名。昅到口輙謂無味。正與龍井雨前茶同。蓋雨前茶葉。嫩綠香甘。實爲清品。僅供一次烹飲。而烹法亦有定程。已經焙乾之茶。臨用必先瀹過。所謂瀹者。即以茶葉置餳置之棚形瓶内以冷水淋洗之。則塵灰盡去。而葉已浸潤。然後待以沸水冲之。水　之沸也。亦有程度。所謂如車轉平賜聲者。水初沸時不過攝氏七十度以上耳。瞬眼生時。則達侂十度以上。必至魚眼生時。始達百度。是謂烹泉已熟。凡能沉澱之物。如絞紛等。悉　沈壺底、乃以毛口有蓋之碗。俗稱悶蓋碗。貯以漏過之茶葉。即以沸水。冲泡至九分滿。加碗蓋使密閉。則碗中成爲眞空。碗蓋密切而不能啓。若過滿。則水自毛口溢出。汪能成爲眞空。蒸汽外散易冷。色香味三者不能各出。失其眞美矣。故予曩歲自采新茶。題基瓶盒云。本來佳茗似佳人。色相天然自有眞。未許狂奴任　牛飲。須知風味勝湖蓴。蓋以擬爲花中之蘭。誠覺至貴。本不可與牡丹同日語耳。</p>
<p>西湖産茶不多。夙稱雲龍獅虎。區爲四等。雲爲五雲山産。其地最高。春分時已發芽可采。謂之明前。龑爲龍并。土壤腴厚。色香味三者益佳。敎雨前采其一旗一槍者。謂之旗權。一孟靜封。至可玩也。獅獅子峯。向易老。山石巉巉。故其葉色蒼翠。不及龍井之嫰綠可愛。虎爲虎跑。地勢低窪。在山澗中采摘最遲。品斯下矣。惟在山中所售之茶。往往以求過於供。且過客客資。每兩之値。多不過一元。少僅三四角。安得非寳品。蓋眞正之土産明前。祗有野生之茶。野人破曉　取。遲即爲捷足者先得之矣。蓋凡有人培植之茶。往往不肯早摘。必待長大。冀其重量増多。得錢多耳</p>

<h3>「說謊者」中的人物</h3>
<p>— 黃俊</p>
<p>復量劇社第十一次公演英國享利瓊斯的傑作『說謊者』的消息、早已傳播了好久、本月一日晚八時先在該校體育館舉行、不日將來滬與海上嗜劇者作一度之覿面、現在反該劇要角的扮演者的姓名和狀况寫給讀者、</p>
<p>唐玄凡　二十年冬季復量文學院外國文學系畢業、在該社演劇中歷任要角、去載公演『西哈諾』時扮克里斯將而成功、此次特地犧牲其寳貴之光陰、來校任『說謊者』要角林望仙、他曾表演過個性堅强的英雄、也曾表演過風流藴藉的情人、這一次又扮演閱世其深的角色、都能展其所長、</p>
<p>吳衷民　浙江海寗人、復量文學院外國文學系學生、將於本年暑假後畢業、亦爲該社中堅份子、這次扮演要角張景凱、頗盡厥職、</p>
<p>梁培澍　梁女士係外國文學系學生將於本年科季畢業、湖南長沙人、幼居美國、操英語流利、本屆四大學英語辯論、女士　獲個人第一、且女士之國語發音亦極正確、說來娓娓動、對於戲劇、則原理固研究有素、舞臺經騐亦頗豐富、去年曾任西哈諾主角霍克桑、稱譽當日、這次擔任要角唐太太韓意蘭、演來較前更進步多多、</p>
<p>李蓮　社會學系學生、安徽滁縣人、亦本年冬季畢業、好旣優於學、又長於運動、惟年來甚少見之於操塲、也許也興趣的减損了罷、近來於戲劇甚有興趣、西哈諾中亦爲一角色、今扮演葉太太韓意芝、韓意芝的滿肚衷情、均能在好她的表情動作之間完全流露、感動觀者不少、</p>
<p>歐陽美德　她是湖北武昌人、會計學系學生、去歲秋季轉八本校、加八復旦劇社表演者亦係初次、扮演林望仙之愛人顧若芬、身份恰合、</p>

<h3>她和她</h3>
<p>— 劉芙鵑</p>
<p>『以後若再見有人拉朋友、就記名、不準回家、』監學厲聲的對學生說、</p>
<p>那天、正是某校自　治會聚會的日期、監學爲什麽這樣嚴厲呢、說起來也好笑、因爲某校的風氣、是歡喜『拉月友、』那班小學生更加起勁、警如、你覺得她有些特别、但是决不能稱贊她的美麗或是批評她一些、候使不當心說了出來、給别人聴了、哈、哈、就說『你愛好了、』</p>
<p>不是說說就罷、並且將你拉到好的房裏、或是拉你兩人出去跑路、那末這樣呌什麽呢、哈哈、呌做『思月友』呢、如果有人在你的旁邊……不是朋友、就給好的名啼做、電燈泡……不通氣、臭蘿　乾………</p>
<p>有時還在黑板上、盡了一個心形、當中、寫個愛字、愛字上面還有個Love字、愛字下面便是個Kiss字、那末將她和她的名字寫在愛字兩旁、心的兩旁邊、還有揩去就愛、不揩也愛、終歸是愛一的字寫着、</p>
<p>每到夜課後或是星期六晚上……不上夜課、房外吵得了不得、聲音中、多數是『思朋友、』囗囗思朋友、或是一拉朋友的聲音、笑聲、喊聲、使人聴了覺得委鬧弄堂裏、眼看見的都是一對一對的朋友、擁擠得幾没有可走、耳聴見的、都是脚步聲、好像操兵一般、眞是熱鬧、</p>
<p>可是想讀書的人、不能忍耐、代表聚會的時候、報告監學、起初還是代表去對她們說、但是仍舊不能禁上好們、没法、祗好要監學自已登場了、駡了一場後、好了不少、</p>
<p>她們爲什麽這樣怕記名呢、並非怕扣分數、不過恐怕不得回家罷了、</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The United States Decides to Cease Military Activities on Guam</h3>
<p>The military activities in the Pacific are of great interest to the world, for the peace of the Pacific is a sign of world peace. Since the commercial expansion of European countries in the last century, all have sought overseas markets, and the Far East Pacific has become a hunting ground for all countries. Although Japan and the United States came later, their ambition to develop the Pacific islands is even stronger. The United States' position in the Pacific is feared to be threatened by Japan, and it has spared no expense in operating and protecting its military preparations. Its protective policy is particularly focused on Guam, which is more than a thousand miles west of the Philippines. The four-sided islands occupied by the United States are of great importance to Japan in terms of location, and Guam, acquired after the Spanish-American War, is the closest territory to the United States, so it has focused even more efforts on its operation. In the previous disarmament conference, the reason why Japan and the United States fought over warships was because their eyes were also focused on this. Today, the world is in an era of commercial decline, and countries are scrambling for trade outlets. The Far East Pacific is an excellent outlet for commerce, and there are concerns that this may cause unexpected storms. Unexpectedly, the recent military conference in the United States has decided to abandon Guam as a naval base, saying that the island no longer has special military value in the future, and the Navy's military activities will be reduced to the minimum. Is this really due to the effect of the London Treaty? According to the opinion of an American Union member, the motivation is not only to save money, but also to show goodwill to the Japanese. If the United States is sincere in doing this and there is no other diplomatic effect, it is also good news for the Pacific.</p>

<h3>Germany's Financial Difficulties</h3>
<p>Increasing Taxes and Reducing Government Spending to Save the Situation. The Government Issues a Proclamation Asking the People to Endure Painful Sacrifices</p>
<p>Reuter Berlin, June 6 The emergency decree approved by the German President yesterday to save Germany's bankruptcy crisis and the proclamation asking the people to make a final sacrifice to reorganize the national finances were issued at the same time today. The German government admits that this decree will cause pain to the people, but it is unavoidable in order to maintain national credit. Germany has saved 1.5 billion marks in government spending, and the 1931 budget is expected to be offset. It can be seen that the saying that Germany has not fully economized is unfounded. The burden of reparations is unbearable and must be escaped. It is hoped that the people will unite. The emergency decree requires a reduction of 20 million pounds in the expenses of social undertakings, national pensions, and unemployment insurance, a reduction of 20 million pounds in the salaries of officials, an increase of 21 million pounds in income tax, a doubling of the sugar tax, a levy of 3.5 million pounds in oil tax, and a reduction of 3 million pounds in unemployment donations. The government is also allowed to reduce the weekly working hours of certain industries to 40 hours with the consent of the parliament, but those who have been specially approved may increase the working hours. The emergency decree also stated that agriculture is difficult and must be relieved. A special income tax of 1% is levied on those with a monthly income of less than 3 million marks, and 5% is levied on those with an income of more than 3 million marks, all levied from July 1 of last year to the end of December of the following year. This tax affects everyone in Germany and is estimated to collect 39 million pounds.</p>

<p>Reuter London, June 6 The talks at the British Prime Minister's villa are being closely watched by today's newspapers. The diplomatic reporters of the newspapers said that the German Chancellor did not bring concrete proposals, but made it clear that if Germany has any more burdens, it will be closer to the danger of a coup by the National Socialist and Communist parties. The German Chancellor also said that due to the decline in prices, Germany's accounts for the past 14 months have increased by 250,000 marks, so the Young Plan to reduce Germany's burden has lost its effectiveness. The Times of Sunday claimed that according to the Young Plan, Germany could stop paying as long as it gave 90 days' notice. Parisian newspapers claimed that the French Foreign Ministry had received a firm statement from the British Foreign Secretary and the German Ambassador to France that the London talks were only of a routine nature. The anxiety of the French has decreased upon seeing this news. The diplomatic reporter of the Sunday Express said this morning that he had learned that the talks between the British and German authorities may result in the convening of a global conference to consider revising various war debts.</p>
<p>Reuter Washington, June 6 Senator Borah strongly advocated reducing Germany's reparations burden at a meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, saying that revision seemed appropriate and economically and fundamentally wise. Forcing Germany into complete economic collapse would not gain anything for the creditor countries. One of the major reasons for the economic decline of Europe and making it more difficult for Germany to cope with its debts is that countries outside Germany have destroyed the clear intention of the Treaty of Versailles and constantly increased their military preparations burden, which cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>Violent Earthquake in England</h3>
<p>Occurred Twice in Succession</p>
<p>No Loss of Life</p>
<p>Europe Also Affected</p>
<p>Kuomin News Agency, London, 7th - A major earthquake, unprecedented in recent memory, struck a large part of England early this morning. People in cities and villages were extremely alarmed. The first tremor occurred at 1:25 AM, followed by a second, more powerful one a few seconds later. London newspapers report that the earthquake was three times stronger than previous major earthquakes. Many house foundations cracked, and many appliances were broken. Notably, in Hull, several houses collapsed. Unusually, many cars started moving on their own, overturning and crashing. People in many cities rushed into the streets in their sleepwear. Fortunately, no deaths or injuries have been reported so far.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th - According to seismologist Shaw of Whitehaven, the earthquake in England was the most severe in British history. The Whitehaven Observatory recorded the earthquake lasting for seven minutes. However, according to wireless operators on the roof of the London Air Ministry, it lasted only eight seconds. The public described their experiences of the earthquake to those who were asleep at the time. Fortunately, an inspection of St. Paul's Cathedral revealed no damage. Morning prayers were held as usual. However, experts will likely need to conduct further inspections.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th - An earthquake was also felt in Europe early this morning. According to reports from Brussels, the entire country of Belgium felt the earthquake around 1:26 AM. Reports from Hilversum and Dunkirk also indicate that earthquakes were felt in those areas. Residents were awakened from their dreams. However, no casualties have been reported in Europe.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rochester, New York, 7th - A slight earthquake was felt here multiple times last night. The first occurred shortly after 9 PM. There was no damage reported between 9 PM and 10 PM, but residents were very alarmed.</p>
<h3>Pacific Ocean Peaceful Atmosphere</h3>
<p>America Decides to Abandon Guam Naval Base to Show Goodwill to Japan</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 7th - According to a telegram from the Associated Press correspondent at the Presidential retreat, after a frugality conference held by the President with naval officials at the Rapidan Camp villa at the end of the week, several important decisions have been made regarding America's position in the Pacific. The most important of these is the recognition that Guam, acquired after the Spanish-American War, no longer has special military value. Henceforth, naval activities on the island will be reduced to the minimum necessary for the local government's needs. In addition, various plans for naval cost-cutting were discussed in detail and will be implemented as soon as circumstances permit. According to the correspondent, the decision of the United States to abandon the Guam naval base has been expected by many since the London Naval Conference. The motivation is not only to save money but also to show goodwill to Japan and improve relations between the two countries. Therefore, after the London Conference concluded, the chargé d'affaires ad interim in Japan, Grew, returned home, and the State Department discussed the matter with naval officials, thoroughly considering naval bases in the Pacific. The results of the discussions were presented to the President, and President Hoover, who had long believed that Guam no longer had military importance, agreed. According to the U.S. State Department, the atmosphere of peace in the Pacific is very good, and with the establishment of coordinated naval plans by the countries concerned, the future of the Pacific remains satisfactory. (Note: Guam, GUAM, is located 1,500 miles east of the Philippines.)</p>
<p>Foreigners in China Hostile to Labor Unions</p>
<p>Chinese Delegate Protests at the International Labour Conference; Representatives of Various Countries Discuss the Quota Problem</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 6th - At today's International Labour Conference's debate on unemployment, the Chinese labor delegate protested against the hostility of foreign capital in China towards labor unions, stating that if foreign employers do not recognize their mistakes, Chinese capitalists may be forced to compel foreign capitalists to respect labor laws.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 6th - Differences of opinion arose today at the conference on limiting the manufacture of narcotics regarding the quota issue. The Chinese delegate stated that China's right as a potential manufacturer and exporter of narcotics should be protected. The Russian delegate stated that limiting manufacture would not be effective without limiting the production of raw materials. The Japanese delegate stated that he advocated that each country should be allowed to manufacture narcotics only to the extent of actual orders, so that supply would not be lacking, and that the conscientious application of the import license system would be a sufficient method of control. The general discussion on the quota problem concluded at this point. Draft clauses have been submitted to the Committee on Limiting the Manufacture of Narcotics.</p>

<p>Ba County Government Asks Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Reclaim Japanese Concession in Wangjiatuo; Six Major Reasons for Immediate Reclamation Listed; Local Government Plans to Announce Abolition of Treaty</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence - The Japanese special concession in Wangjiatuo, in this city, has become a den of thieves and a hub for the trafficking of morphine and firearms. The people of Samba have repeatedly expressed their desire for reclamation. Now, Feng Junyi, the Magistrate of Ba County, fearing that the intense public sentiment is difficult to suppress and that an outbreak would harm Sino-Japanese relations, has telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, listing six reasons, requesting that negotiations for reclamation be expedited. The original text is transcribed below: 1. The Chongqing South Bank Wangjiatuo Japanese special concession has been repeatedly requested by the public to be reclaimed to restore national sovereignty. The County Magistrate has telegraphed reports to this effect. Upon reviewing the documents of the former Qing Dynasty Eastern Sichuan Dao Yin Yamen, it was found that the "Agreement on the Wangjiatuo Japanese Special Concession" was signed by Bao Fen, the Eastern Sichuan Military Preparedness Dao, and Yamazaki Katsura, the Japanese Consul stationed in Chongqing, on the 12th day of the eighth month of the 27th year of the Guangxu reign. After careful translation, the various clauses contained therein are no longer necessary. The reasons are as follows: (1) The Wangjiatuo area was designated as a Japanese special concession because the Chinese government planned to build a new customs house in Wangjiatuo to accommodate foreign nationals moving there. During the early Guangxu era, China and foreign countries had just begun to trade, and customs differed greatly. Qing officials feared that Chinese and foreign people living together in the city would cause trouble, so they advocated opening a new customs house to house foreigners. Now that Chinese and foreign people are accustomed to living together, the former concerns have naturally been dispelled due to the different social conditions of today and the past. This Wangjiatuo Japanese special concession should be reclaimed immediately based on temporal considerations. (2) Article 14 of the agreement states, "The Chinese and Japanese commissioners originally agreed in Article 3 that Japanese merchants are temporarily allowed to reside in Chongqing City, following the example of Western merchants. The number of Japanese merchants shall not exceed 20, and the number of trading firms shall not exceed 10. If the number exceeds this limit, the excess Japanese merchants shall move to Wangjiatuo first. Japanese people traveling for pleasure are not included." This clearly indicates that if the number of Japanese merchants is within 20 and the number of trading firms is within 10, they can reside in Chongqing City. Only when the number exceeds the above limits can they move to Wangjiatuo. Currently, the number of Japanese merchants is less than 20, and the number of trading firms is less than 10. In the Guangxu era, residing in the city was already possible. This Wangjiatuo Japanese special concession should be reclaimed immediately based on the residential situation of Japanese merchants. (3) The Qing Dynasty agreed to build a new customs house in Wangjiatuo to accommodate foreign nationals coming to Chongqing for trade who exceeded the number allowed to reside and operate in the city. The Wangjiatuo new customs house was never established, and Japan alone rented the land for special management, encroaching on interests for nearly 30 years. The Chinese government has been particularly generous to the Japanese. This Wangjiatuo Japanese special concession should be reclaimed immediately based on reason. (4) Article 2 of the agreement states that the Japanese special concession is exclusively for Japanese merchants, and the special management is the exclusive management of the merchants in the concession by the Japanese consul. This means that the Chinese government temporarily leased the land to Japanese merchants for residence and business because the number of Japanese merchants in the city exceeded the original limit. The Japanese consul stationed in Chongqing was responsible for the affairs of the merchants in the concession. According to investigations by the County Magistrate, there are only a few Japanese merchants residing in the concession, and even if Japanese merchants are operating, Chinese merchants hold the majority of the shares. Since it is not a gathering place for Japanese merchants, why is consular management necessary? The name does not match the reality and should be abolished. This Wangjiatuo Japanese special concession should be reclaimed immediately based on facts. (5) Article 2 of the agreement states that "the roads are still Chinese roads, and the land is still Chinese land," which contradicts the statement in Article 4 that the land is leased to Japanese merchants in perpetuity. The inequality of the treaty at the time is evident. Since the land is Chinese land, the right to lease it naturally rests with us. Moreover, Japanese merchants are not currently residing there and there is no need to lease it. This Wangjiatuo special concession should be reclaimed immediately based on national sovereignty. (6) The Chinese government cannot exercise its authority within the concession. In the past year, cases have occurred such as the Japanese police officer Guan Sazhibingwei smuggling pig bristles and residents harboring bandits, which have aroused public resentment. The people have come to the county to request the reclamation of the Wangjiatuo Japanese special concession. Chinese public sentiment is not what it used to be. The County Magistrate fears that prolonged brewing will erupt and be difficult to suppress, hindering Sino-Japanese friendship. This Wangjiatuo Japanese special concession should be reclaimed immediately for the sake of fostering friendly relations. I respectfully telegraph these reasons, humbly requesting your ministry to investigate and consider the intense public sentiment, and immediately bring this matter to the Japanese side for serious negotiation, aiming to abolish the treaty and reclaim sovereignty in the shortest possible time. The telegraph is urgent, and we await your instructions. Furthermore, Article 10 of the agreement states that all leases should be limited to 30 years, and upon expiration, the leases should be renewed. In the future, the practice of renewing the lease every 30 years should continue. The agreement was signed on the 12th day of the eighth month of the 27th year of the Guangxu reign, which is the 24th day of the ninth month of the 34th year of the Meiji era in Japan. From the date of signing the agreement to September of this year, it will be 30 years, the expiration date for lease renewal. Also, this agreement was negotiated by the local administrative officer and the Japanese consul, not by the Qing court and the Japanese ambassador. According to its nature, it seems to have a local character. Now, assessing the national situation and examining the original agreement, there is no need to continue this arrangement with Japan for the Wangjiatuo special concession. Can we, at the time of the expiration of the lease, based on the declaration of the National Assembly, announce the abolition of the treaty automatically by the local government? Please provide instructions via telegram. Feng Junyi, Magistrate of Ba County, Sichuan, bows respectfully.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Causes Another Disaster on Xiang River</h3>
<p>"Wuling Maru" Collides with Two Civilian Boats</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence - Japanese ships sailing on inland rivers have repeatedly violated agreements and caused disasters. For example, the "Xiangjiang Maru" collided with the "Taishun" steamer on the Xiang River, and the provincial government is seriously negotiating the matter. However, before that matter is settled, the "Wuling Maru" again violated agreements by sailing in Chenglinji, resulting in the collision and sinking of two civilian boats, which is truly infuriating. The incident occurred at dawn on May 20. The Japanese "Wuling Maru," traveling from Yueyang to Changsha, was about to arrive in front of the Chenglinji Customs House when three cargo boats were sailing downstream. The "Wuling Maru" did not issue a warning signal to allow them to take evasive action, but instead veered to the left and collided with civilian boats. Consequently, they were unable to dodge and two boats were smashed and sank immediately. One was damaged but fortunately did not capsize. There was a massive flood, and the people on the two boats were floating in the water, crying out for help. Fortunately, one boat tried its best to rescue them, and the customs motorboat arrived after hearing the alarm and rescued everyone. After the incident, it was found that one was a boat from Hanshou, owned by Li Jiahua, carrying over 100,000 duck eggs from the Desheng Foreign Firm in Shuikou Alley, Changde, worth about 3,000 yuan. The other was a boat from Liling, owned by Chen, fully loaded with Liling pottery, worth about 4,000 yuan. The cost of the two boats and their family businesses was no less than 3,000 yuan, with total losses estimated at around 10,000 yuan. The boat owners, living on the riverbank, were suffering from hunger and cold, and had to request assistance from the customs and water police. Li Huashu, the captain of the water police, reported the incident to the provincial government, requesting that the Changyue Customs Supervisor temporarily detain the "Wuling Maru" pending resolution of the negotiations, and instructed Captain Song Yuanheng to ascertain the exact number of civilian boats damaged, obtain certificates from the local public law organizations, and submit diagrams for verification.

<h3>Japanese in Harbin Assault Chinese</h3>
<p>Workers Nakamura et al. from Meiji Auto Repair Shop Beat Chinese Shi Yuheng to Death</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence - This evening (2nd) at 7:30 PM, Shi Yuheng, a Tianjin native, appeared to be a laborer, (rumored to have driven cars for a certain American foreign firm) aged about 20, was drunk. While walking in Daoli, he staggered past the Meiji Auto Repair Shop owned by the Japanese near the southern end of Mai Mai Street. At the time, Japanese workers Nakamura Seiichiro and Masuru Zōrun et al. from the shop were playing jump rope in the street. As Shi walked close to them, he staggered and fell over. After Shi got up, he was about to argue with them, but Nakamura et al. were already enraged, scolding him for intruding into their game, and cursing in Japanese. Shi retorted with insults, which further enraged the Japanese, who punched Shi in the chest, knocking him down. Shi refused to accept the beating and got up to argue again. The Japanese became more enraged and four or five Japanese workers pinned Shi down and punched and kicked him, also kicking his lower body. Nakamura also took a wooden stick and struck Shi on the head, causing a deep gash on his forehead and blood to pour out. He immediately lost consciousness. Many Chinese passersby who witnessed this were outraged and protesting noisily. Nearby police officers arrived after hearing the news, and patrol officer Gao Jianzhang from the Hengdaokou police station also arrived. After being informed that Nakamura was the main culprit, he intended to interrogate him. Nakamura, feeling guilty, suspected that he was about to be arrested and retreated to the doorway of the auto repair shop, holding a wooden stick, refusing to allow officer Gao et al. to approach. The Chinese onlookers shouted and urged Gao to arrest him. Gao tried to dissuade them and was also provoked by their outrage. He then stepped forward and grabbed Nakamura. At this time, Komatsu Sakuto, the police chief of the Japanese consulate, also arrived with five Japanese police officers to stop Nakamura from resisting arrest. The two sides negotiated. Sun Zhoufu, the chief of the Erdao police department, also arrived with officer Jin Ruifang after hearing the news. While this was happening, Zōrun Masaru, who had aided the assailant, suddenly rushed out of the building, attempting to drive a car out of the garage to gather other Japanese residents and Japanese police to help. The crowd suspected that he was trying to escape and went forward to prevent him from driving away. Zōrun became enraged and struck a nearby Chinese man, who retaliated. As a result, Zōrun was also injured. Officers from both sides, hearing that the conflict had started again, rushed out to mediate. The crowd's anger subsided slightly, but several thousand Chinese people gathered, demanding that Chief Sun arrest the assailant. Chief Sun then negotiated with Komatsu, and the two sides agreed to take the injured people of their respective countries away for treatment first. Nakamura, the main assailant, was taken away by Komatsu for interrogation. Before leaving, Komatsu, fearing that the Chinese onlookers would take further action, requested that three police officers be left outside the Meiji foreign firm to suppress the crowd. Zōrun Masaru, the injured Japanese man, suffered head and chest injuries, but they were not serious and he was taken to the Takeda Hospital for treatment. Shi Yuheng, the injured Chinese man, was taken to the municipal hospital for treatment. Because the head injuries were severe, he remained unconscious after treatment. Doctors said they were unsure of his prognosis. After both police officers reached an agreement, the Chinese onlookers remained angry and protested for a long time, gradually dispersing around 9 PM.

<h3>Shao Lizi Arrives in Jinan from Beijing</h3>
<p>Ge Jingen and Qian Zhuolun Pass Through Jinan to Ping</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - Central Committee member Shao Lizi arrived in Jinan at 6:10 PM today (5th) on the second-class train 202 from Pingpu. Traveling with him were Ge Jingen, Vice Chief of the General Staff of the General Staff Headquarters, and Qian Zhuolun, Deputy Director of the Staff Department of the General Headquarters. When the train arrived in Tai'an, Ma Hongkui, the General Commander of the 15th Route Army, telegraphed the provincial government. Han Fuju, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, and Jiang Bocheng, the Chief Counselor of the Land, Sea, and Air Force General Headquarters, welcomed him at the station. After the train arrived, Shao et al. got off and met with Han and Jiang, and then went to the first-class waiting room to rest. According to Shao, he came to Shandong to visit Chairman Han and had no mission. He will stay for three or four days and then return to Nanjing. Regarding the Guangdong situation, Zhang Puquan recently telegraphed from Guangzhou, saying that the situation in Guangdong is extremely complicated and that troops should absolutely not be sent. As for the Central Government's approach to Guangdong, if there is a glimmer of hope, troops will never be sent to suppress them. Based on current observations, the Guangdong situation can be resolved peacefully. Regarding Chairman Chiang's trip to Jiangxi, the National Assembly has a resolution to eliminate the Red Bandits, so Chairman Chiang must go to Jiangxi. However, the date has not yet been set. Ge and Qian then boarded the train and continued north. Han and Jiang saw them off and then rode with Shao Lizi to the provincial government for dinner. Shao is temporarily staying at the Jiaoji Hotel (June 5th).</p>
<h3>Dispute Between Chinese and German Pigment Merchants</h3>
<p>German Merchant Raises Objections Over Trademark Issue, Intending to Suppress Chinese Pigment Merchant, Qingdao Correspondence</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the immaturity of various industries in China and the scarcity of products, most daily necessities are imported, and the annual outflow of funds is immeasurable. The pigment industry is entirely dependent on foreign imports, and no Chinese merchant has paid attention to this. In order to reclaim rights, Chen Jiefu, a merchant in this city, raised 30,000 yuan in the autumn of 1929 to establish the China Pigment Joint-Stock Company Manufacturing Plant in Sifang. The first product was only vulcanized blue, with the Weaver Girl as the trademark, which was registered with the Trademark Bureau last year. The annual sales are about 10,000 boxes, and the price is one-tenth cheaper than foreign goods, making sales very brisk. The factory is now planning to manufacture cooked blue and produce its own nitric acid, using purely domestic raw materials, making the products purely domestic. The factory's products have now been sold in major commercial ports in the north and south, and foreign pigments have been significantly impacted. However, recently, the German Da De Pigment Factory, through its agent, the Shanghai Defu Foreign Firm, filed an objection with the Trademark Bureau, claiming that the China Pigment Company's Weaver Girl trademark is suspected of imitating the Da De Pigment Factory's Cowherd and Weaver Girl trademark, and requested that it be revoked. The Trademark Bureau has instructed the China Pigment Company to respond. It is reported that the company claims that although the trademark is based on the same theme as the German trademark, the pictures, colors, sizes, characters, and names are all different, and there is absolutely no suspicion of imitation. They have submitted a written reply to the Trademark Bureau, requesting further review. The reasons are roughly divided into six points: (1) The colors are different. The paper of the Da De Pigment Factory is five-colored, with three layers of special gold. The Cowherd wears a dark red short shirt and long yellow trousers, with yellow socks and red shoes. The two Weaver Girls wear one yellow dress and one green vest. The cow is purple, the ground is green, and there are green trees and white stones. The paper of the company is light blue, the Cowherd wears a light red coat and green shorts, the Weaver Girl wears a light red earth-colored shirt and a white skirt, with a green waist decoration. The cow is black, and there is a black crow. The colors of the two sides are vastly different, and we must request a review. (2) The height and position of the characters are different. The characters of the Da De Pigment Factory are at both ends, one in the upper right corner and one in the lower left corner, two women and one man, plus one cow. The characters of the company are all in the center, one man and one woman, and one cow. The height and position of the characters on both sides are very different, and the number of people is also different. We must request a second review. (3) The forms are different. The Cowherd of the Da De Pigment Factory is standing on the ground with his hands clasped, expressing his welcome as the Weaver Girl arrives on a cloud. The Cowherd and Weaver Girl of the company are both standing on clouds, whispering together, and the Weaver Girl looks like she is about to leave. The forms are different, and their backs are also different. We must request a third review. (4) The trademark names are different. One is Cowherd and Weaver Girl, one is Weaver Girl. We must request a fourth review. (5) There is no clear restriction in trademark law on the same story in terms of customs, let alone a Chinese story. We must request a fifth review. (6) Without carefully distinguishing, confusion is caused by the simplicity of the name. The Da De Pigment Factory clearly marks the Da De Pigment Factory, as well as the Cowherd and Weaver Girl and the Lion Bird mark. The company uses Chinese and foreign languages, indicating the place of manufacture, Qingdao, and the company name, China Pigment Company, and also specifies the type of pigment as cooked blue. Without careful distinction, it can be clearly understood, and there is no possibility of confusion. Moreover, the paper sizes are different, one is long and narrow, and the other is square and short. We must request a sixth review. (June 4)</p>

<h3>Ministry Orders the Jiaoji Railway Bureau to Economize Expenditures</h3>
<p>And orders the formulation of proposals for material management. A Qingdao dispatch: The Ministry of Railways in Nanjing, due to the excessive routine budget expenditure of the Jiaoji Railway, specially ordered the bureau yesterday to strive for economy in accordance with four policies. The bureau, upon receiving the order, has notified all departments. The Ministry of Railways' order is recorded below: "Upon review, the revised general affairs expenses are listed at over 2.3 million yuan, and the vehicle affairs expenses are listed at over 1.4 million yuan, which is still excessive. This demonstrates that the railway has been excessively wasteful in its routine operations, leading to a situation that is difficult to reverse. Considering the reported difficulties as genuinely factual, the revised budget for the 20th year is tentatively approved for record. However, to ensure the effective implementation of the budget and economization, the railway should implement the following policies this year: (1) Gradually reduce redundant personnel and report progress monthly; (2) Use scientific methods to save all unnecessary expenses; (3) Strive to increase efficiency in all personnel expenditures; (4) The final account for this year's expenditures must be less than the budget, so as to achieve a gradual reduction in management fees and achieve real results. All capital expenditures should be specially submitted for approval in advance, and you must strictly comply. Detailed salary lists should also be submitted as soon as possible for verification. The Ministry of Railways will soon convene a material conference and specially order the Jiaoji Railway Bureau to prepare proposals in advance for presentation at the conference." The bureau has instructed its machinery, engineering, vehicle affairs, and materials departments to formulate proposals for submission in accordance with the order. The original Ministry order is as follows: "It has been noted that various railways have not paid sufficient attention to the issue of materials. Compared to vehicle, engineering, and machinery affairs, this is a regrettable imbalance. Historically, the purchase of materials by various railways has often been conducted independently, and the status of inventories is not shared among them. Often, rarely used materials are heavily stocked, while commonly used materials are in short supply. Year after year, half of the materials are surplus, while other railways are unable to purchase them, and this railway treats them as waste. Such malpractices exist everywhere, wasting railway funds and hindering progress. This issue has been raised at the Ministry affairs meeting, and a decision has been made to dispatch Ministry Technician Yan Deqing, Engineering Department Director Sa Fujun, concurrently appointed Technician and Engineering Department Assistant Sun Mou, and Ministry personnel familiar with materials to take charge of preparations and formulate plans. Furthermore, personnel in charge of using and managing materials will be designated from various railways to bring various materials to the Ministry for preliminary preparation. Once preparations are complete, a conference will be convened. However, material affairs are divided into selection, purchase, management, bookkeeping, receipt, and dispatch, and the procedures are extremely complex. To organize them, the statistics, budget allocation, unified naming, classification, numbering, and review of regulations and procedures must be carried out simultaneously. Discussions will form the basis for organization, and plans will provide the path for implementation. You must express your views and formulate proposals, submitting them to the Ministry before June 30 for presentation at the conference." You must comply with these instructions. (June 5th)</p>

<p>The Liaoning Provincial Gazetteer Office Extracts and Photoprints a Shenyang Dispatch: The Qing Dynasty, starting from Odoli City and calling itself the Manchus, from its founding to its entry into the Pass and its final years, its military achievements and literary governance are recorded in the national history and the Donghua Records. However, the Donghua Records are embellished works, and the completed draft of the History of the Qing Dynasty has not yet been circulated. Other unofficial histories and anecdotal accounts are mostly based on unreliable rumors and cannot be taken as authoritative sources. The only reliable source is the Veritable Records of each dynasty. However, only two manuscript copies of this book exist, stored within the Imperial Court and the Shiqu Baoji, inaccessible to outsiders. Last summer, the Liaoning Provincial Gazetteer Office, while editing the gazetteer, was able to borrow the book from the provincial government for viewing. The entire book contains over 30 million words in Chinese, and the Manchu version is roughly the same. The Manchu Veritable Records are at the beginning, and the records are detailed and realistic, with detailed illustrations attached. The calligraphy and paintings are exquisite, created by famous artists of the time. The silk brocade cover and ivory chopsticks, wrapped in embroidered silk, are truly a monumental work of the era. Colleagues in the office initially planned to raise funds and hire craftsmen to replicate the book, but due to the vastness of the entire work, it was not easy to accomplish quickly. Therefore, they extracted the Manchu Veritable Records with detailed illustrations, totaling eight large volumes, and photoprinted only the Chinese text and illustrations for wider circulation. The book has now been meticulously produced by the Northeast University factory. However, due to the high cost of printing, only 1,000 copies were made, costing approximately 30,000 silver dollars. The book is a unique and unprecedented work in the world, and an extraordinary book in history, of great importance to history, geography, literature, and art. The provincial government plans to purchase copies for distribution to libraries and education bureaus in various counties for research. Chairman Wan of Jiangsu Province and Chairman Zhang of Jilin Province have each already purchased 40 copies for gifts. It is said that there were originally two manuscript copies of the book, but only one remains. It is rumored that the other copy was stolen by palace eunuchs and sold to the Japanese in the early years of the Republic for over 20,000 silver dollars. (June 3rd)</p>
<h3>Second Embezzlement Case Discovered in Liyang County</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Li Jinfang Exposes the Case to the Provincial Government. Former Liyang County Magistrate Zhang Quan, Zheng Chengyuan, and Finance Bureau Chief Pan Bin of Jiangsu Province, in collusion with local organizations, party branches, and gentry groups, embezzled national currency and committed a major embezzlement case involving land taxes. The provincial government transferred the case to the Zhenjiang District Court for preliminary trial. After Zhang and Zheng appealed, the High Court, based on the circumstances, requested instructions from the Central Government, but the trial has not yet begun. Pan Bin died in prison. Unexpectedly, the successor Finance Bureau Chief Pan Keping, together with Shi Junsheng and Peng Jin, standing committee members of the county's Chamber of Commerce, staged a second major embezzlement case. County Magistrate Li Jinfang submitted the entire case and related documents to Provincial Government Chairman Ye Chucang on the 6th of this month, requesting that it be transferred to the court for investigation. Key points of the submission are excerpted below: (1) 13,500 Yuan. During Pan Bin's tenure, he borrowed 20,000 yuan from the Chamber of Commerce using 25,000 yuan in silver certificates as collateral, with a contract specifying a monthly interest rate of 1.5%. The remaining 5,000 yuan was used as collateral interest. During Pan Bin's tenure, only 11,500 yuan was received, and the remaining 13,500 yuan was used by Pan Keping. Furthermore, the collected silver certificate coupons have been completely cleared, with no arrears. Since the grain coupons were intercepted by the previous official to the amount of 13,500 yuan, they should have been included in the new receipts and allocated to the province and localities for public distribution. However, after leaving office, Pan Keping published accounts that omitted this uncollected amount, taking advantage of Pan Bin's death to conceal the truth and attempt to embezzle the funds. Moreover, he falsely claimed 1,496 yuan for interest paid to the Chamber of Commerce under local expenses in the published accounts.</p>
<p>(2) 1,496 Yuan in Interest. During Pan Bin's tenure, he borrowed 20,000 yuan from the Chamber of Commerce using 22,000 yuan in silver certificates as collateral. This amount was not paid in full at once, and the dates of successive payments are all verifiable. When Pan Bin made the agreement, he specified a monthly interest rate of 1.5%, which was intended to be used for padding the accounts and self-enrichment when repaying the loan in the future. The Chamber of Commerce was pleased to obtain the loan without incurring losses and did not expect to receive any interest. However, Pan Bin left office due to his crimes before completing the receipt of funds. Pan Keping, upon taking office, inherited his assets and satisfied his own greed. The 20,000 yuan borrowed using silver certificates was originally allocated to various merchants, and the subsequent repayments were also allocated to households. Additionally, during the tenure of former County Magistrate Yuan, the Finance Bureau also borrowed 8,000 yuan from the Chamber of Commerce, which was also allocated to various merchants. This amount was also reported by Pan Keping at the County Administration Meeting on February 10 of the 20th year as an interest expense. After Pan Keping published the accounts, merchants who originally borrowed the money saw that the published accounts listed a total of 1,496 yuan in interest, but the merchants did not receive any of it. The borrowers inquired one after another, and the county summoned Chamber of Commerce Chairman Shi Junsheng (Shi Cantang), standing committee members Sun Zuze (Sun Shaobo), Hu Guoyuan (Hu Moxian), and Di Dechen (Di Dianshen) for questioning. When asked why the interest received by the Chamber of Commerce was not distributed to the households, Shi Junsheng and others claimed that only 400 yuan in interest was received, of which 200 yuan was in the form of grain coffer ledger receipts and not cash. Another 170 yuan was given as rewards for the labor of intercepting grain certificate repayments to the grain coffer, and only 30 yuan was received in cash, which was kept by standing committee member Peng Jin (Peng Kangxi). They further stated that they received nothing else. When asked why they issued interest receipts allowing Pan Keping to report the expense in the accounts if no interest was received, they all claimed that it was a conditional arrangement.</p>
<p>(3) 35,000 Yuan. When Zhang Quan was in office, he was ordered to organize a police brigade. In January of the 19th year, the Chamber of Commerce advanced 35,000 yuan to purchase weapons. This amount was included in the 19th-year budget as an expected revenue stream and was gradually repaid. However, at the end of the 19th year (lunar calendar), Chamber of Commerce Chairman Shi Junsheng and committee member Peng Jin approached Pan Keping, seeking to return the previously borrowed gun money for 6,000 yuan as a "birthday gift." This matter was agreed upon by both parties and completed on February 14th of the 20th year (the 27th day of the 12th month in the lunar calendar). The Chamber of Commerce, represented by Shi Junsheng, obtained 30,000 yuan from the Finance Bureau. Pan Keping then ordered the Chamber of Commerce to sign a receipt for 35,000 yuan for the return of gun expenses, and a separate receipt for 1,496 yuan in interest. Apart from the 30,000 yuan that the Chamber of Commerce actually received from the Finance Bureau and the 400 yuan in interest, Pan Keping obtained an illicit gain of 6,096 yuan in this single transaction at the end of the year without any effort. With regard to the above, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Shi Junsheng, standing committee members Sun Zuze, Di Dechen, Hu Guoguang, and Peng Kangxi are guilty of jointly embezzling, misappropriating funds, and offering bribes. It is requested that they be transferred to the court for prosecution in the same case. Except for Peng Kangxi, who is at large and being actively pursued, the other committee members have been placed under the custody of reputable shops, ensuring their availability for questioning.</p>
<h3>Fujian Authorities Focus on Provincial Capital's Security</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Promulgates Regulations for Population Census Cancellation of Special Investigation Teams and Organizational Requirements Fuzhou Dispatch: Since the execution of Xie She members Cao Kai and others, the authorities in Fujian Province have paid close attention to the security of the provincial capital. Yesterday, the provincial government promulgated regulations for a population census, requiring each household head to provide a guarantee during the census, clearly stating those without occupations, residents, or those who have migrated elsewhere. Any household head found to be harboring bandits, hiding firearms, or other dangerous items must report to the relevant police station or directly to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Failure to report will result in joint and several liability and will be dealt with according to the law, which is extremely strict. The special investigation team of the Martial Law Headquarters, at the time of the execution of Cao Kai and others, the team leader, Ruan Wenjiu, had already resigned. Only Deputy Commander Li determined that Ruan was effective on the 1st of this month. The content of the resolution is recorded as follows: (Article 1): All workers inside and outside the Kailuo Six Mines shall have their original wages increased by eight cents per ocean dollar. (Article 2): Increase bonuses for outside workers. The Mining Bureau shall set aside four cents per ton of coal produced each year for distribution to all outside workers underground, but the annual amount shall not be less than fifteen yuan. The bonus for outside workers above ground is tentatively set at twelve yuan per share. If they are converted to inside workers in the future, they shall enjoy the same treatment as inside workers (this year's bonus must be paid for the entire year). (Article 3): The Mining Bureau must clearly classify the titles of inside and outside workers at all levels. The lowest wage code for outside workers shall be determined by the mine unions themselves with the subcontractors. The factory supervisor must supervise the implementation at all times. (Article 4): Before the implementation of the Factory Law, if a worker dies on duty, the Mining Bureau shall provide a compensation of 300 ocean dollars, funeral expenses of 50 ocean dollars, and a coffin. If there is a suitable vacancy, their children shall be given priority for employment, and the disabled shall be compensated according to the above-mentioned proportions. (Article 5): After registration, outside workers shall be entitled to participate in the People's Savings Association. (Article 6): All inside workers above ground and outside workers in the brick kiln shall have their working hours reduced from nine and a half hours to nine hours. (Article 7): The Mining Bureau shall uniformly line the ceilings of the living quarters of inside and outside workers. (Article 8): All worker registration matters shall be carried out jointly by labor and management, from June 15 to August 31 of this year, and must be completed. (Article 9): Before the complete abolition of the subcontracting system, the Mining Bureau must do its best to abolish the second level of subcontracting above ground, allowing workers to contract themselves under the main contractor, and supervise the subcontractors to ensure that wages are paid according to the increased amounts. (Article 10): The Mining Bureau shall apply to the authorities for registration of the workers' children's school in the shortest possible time. (Article 11): Apprentices and technical apprentices who have completed two years and passed the examination may be promoted to journeymen.

(Article 12): This resolution shall apply to technicians, clerks, and lower-level clerks in addition to inside and outside workers. (Article 13): The contract signed by both parties on May 1, 18th year, shall remain in effect to the extent that it is the same as this resolution. (Article 14): All the terms and conditions of this mediation agreement shall be effective from June 1, 20th year of the Republic of China. (June 4th)</p>
<h3>Ma Yinchu's Opinions on the Private Bank Law</h3>
<p>Report at the Memorial Week of the Legislative Yuan on the 25th. Mr. President, honorable members, and comrades, today the President has ordered me to report. If I were to report on the fragmentary work of the Economic Committee and the Commercial Law Drafting Committee in revising various bills, it would be very dry and uninteresting. Therefore, I will now report on the issue of the Private Bank Law. Since the promulgation of the Banking Law, private banks in general have believed that they are subordinate to the banks and are therefore not very satisfied, hoping to enact a separate Private Bank Law. Later, the Shanghai Private Bank Association initiated this idea, and private bank groups in various regions responded with telegrams. Now, after studying this issue, I believe that the reasons they have put forward, the more important ones, can be divided into eight points: (1) Private banks rely on credit, while banks rely on collateral. (2) The capital is too large according to the provisions of the Banking Law. (3) Private banks should be allowed to operate as sole proprietorships. (4) Article 9 of the Banking Law is not applicable to private banks. (5) The requirement of a property certificate is considered very difficult in China. (6) They also believe that the issue of 20% of the guarantee deposit cannot be achieved. (7) They are unwilling to be inspected by the Ministry of Finance and do not have to prepare balance sheets, profit and loss statements, etc. for public announcement. (8) Business hours cannot be restricted. Regarding these eight points, we can roughly study them separately. First, he said that private banks make loans on credit, while banks make loans on collateral. In fact, this is not entirely true. I have also worked in the banking industry and know that some banks do not necessarily focus on making loans on collateral. Some make loans on credit, even hundreds of thousands of dollars, without any collateral. As for private banks making loans, they do not rely entirely on credit either. Many also require collateral, such as overdrafts with collateral, etc. Therefore, it is not true to say that banks rely solely on loans with collateral, while private banks make loans solely on credit. For example, many banks in Beiping make loans on credit, and the Hankou Bank is also like this. Therefore, if we separate them and think that banks must rely on loans with collateral and private banks must rely on loans with credit, that is not the case in fact. There is another point. Assuming that banks mainly rely on collateral and private banks mainly rely on credit, then the question of whether the so-called method of making loans on credit should continue to exist in the future is also</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>is a question, and it may be dangerous in times of economic panic. Even merchants who are usually very reliable have problems in this time of panic. Therefore, the method of making loans on credit should not exist in either banks or private banks. However, in order to accommodate the facts, we do not absolutely prohibit loans on credit in the Banking Law, but only add some restrictions. As for the private banks' hope to enact a separate Private Bank Law, not according to the organization of a company, but still according to the organization of a partnership, this is also a very problematic point. For example, the custom in Shanghai, we know that most private banks organized as partnerships, although they are nominally responsible for unlimited liability, in reality, they call it sharing unlimited liability. Assuming that a private bank has five owners, this private bank went bankrupt because of a loss of one million. Then, each person should take out 200,000 yuan. If four people cannot take it out, only one person has money. Since it is unlimited liability, he should bear joint and several unlimited liability alone and take out one million yuan. As for how the five people solve it, this is an internal problem. However, their kind of sharing unlimited liability is not like that. Only this person takes out 200,000 yuan to make up for his share of the loss. The remaining 800,000 yuan is not accounted for. This method is very wrong. They usually say on the surface that they are responsible for unlimited liability, but once they go bankrupt, they are only responsible for sharing unlimited liability. From this point of view in fact, once a private bank goes bankrupt, it is very difficult to clear the external debts, because the so-called unlimited liability simply becomes a signboard. Therefore, when we formulated the Company Law last year, we did not recognize this method of theirs and did not advocate the provision of shared unlimited liability. It should be organized according to the Company Law and must bear joint and several liability in order to protect capitalists on the one hand and depositors and other creditors on the other. It must be known that the legislator must take into account the capitalists on the one hand and the safety of depositors and other creditors on the other. When we legislate, we should not only focus on the capitalists, but also take into account the other party of the capitalists. However, those who speak to us are capitalists. We cannot only legislate based on the one-sided words of the capitalists. The opposing party of the capitalists has no organization and no opportunity to speak to us. We cannot sacrifice their right to be protected by law just because they have no organization. Moreover, there were originally one or two hundred private banks in Shanghai, but dozens of them went bankrupt in the year of the Xinhai Revolution. Later, when the exchange had a turmoil, dozens more went bankrupt. I don't know how many went bankrupt in the rubber turmoil. Now, in Guangdong, private banks can do business with only four or five thousand yuan, specializing in buying and selling Hong Kong dollars. Sometimes they even cause a run on the Central Bank's banknotes, and they can take this opportunity to manipulate everything and do not do legitimate business. They are even more unconcerned about the interests of creditors. Chen Mingshu, the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, used a quick knife to cut the mess and banned them, asking them to increase their capital, otherwise they would not be allowed to operate. Let's look at the small private banks in the interior, which have a direct interest with the general public. Therefore, we must not only protect the private banks, but also protect the people who have relations with the private banks. Then, whether according to law or custom, since they are equally responsible for unlimited liability, why can't they be reorganized into an unlimited company according to the provisions of the Company Law? Now some people advocate teaching us to amend the Banking Law into a Financial Law and include all banking and money industries in it. Whether this can be adopted is still to be discussed. As for the second point, the so-called capital is too large. Originally, most of the private banks in Shanghai had more than 200,000 yuan. However, the assets of private banks in the interior</p>
<p>are very small, some have 100,000 or 80,000, and some have less than 40,000 or 50,000. Now they feel that the organization of an unlimited company stipulated in the Banking Law, whose capital must be at least 50,000 yuan, seems too high. Some advocate reducing it. We do not insist on this point. I personally have no fixed opinion. Thirdly, they advocate that they can operate as sole proprietorships. We think it is not very appropriate. We must know that private banks have relations with all aspects. For example, the notes issued by private banks are</p>
<p>everyone wants to use them, so private banks are different from other businesses. For example, I opened</p>
<p>a bookstore that specializes in selling textbooks, which is only related to students, and has nothing to do with people other than students. Private banks are not like that, because the notes they issue are related to everyone. If they are allowed to operate as sole proprietorships, it is really very dangerous. Now foreign countries have slowly banned sole proprietorships and have been reorganized into companies. In Japan, all banking and money industries must be organized as limited companies. As for the fourth point, the subsidiary business stipulated in Article 9 of the Banking Law does not apply to private banks. We don't see why it doesn't apply. Don't private banks buy and sell raw gold, silver, and securities? Don't private banks act as agents for receiving and paying bills? As for the fifth point, the requirement for private bank shareholders to issue a property certificate, I would like to ask all the members to discuss it. In my opinion,</p>
<p>shareholders who are responsible for unlimited liability, if they have property other than the capital they invested in the private bank, they cannot escape their responsibility no matter where they go. However, in fact, if there is no other property, then despite saying that it is unlimited liability, it is just empty talk. Therefore, it is necessary to prove their property. Otherwise, even poor people</p>
<p>can be responsible for unlimited liability, which is so dangerous to society. Therefore, the property certificate comes with unlimited liability. The two cannot be separated. Sixth, the issue of 20% of the guarantee deposit should also be decided by all the members. As for the seventh point, the request is the most unreasonable. In their opinion, not only do they not want to be inspected by the Ministry of Finance, but they also don't want to prepare various reports. It is really unreasonable. We must not allow this request. As for the eighth point, it is the question of business hours. According to the provisions of the Banking Law, although it is from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., there is also a proviso that it can be extended if necessary for business. Looking at it this way, it is not reluctantly forcing them to comply with the time in any way, and it can be extended to the evening. As for the 20% guarantee deposit, they object to it being kept in the Central Bank. It must be known that the Banking Law's provisions on this point are to prevent business bankruptcy and protect social security, which is why this is stipulated. However, since they think there is a problem, we can study it in the future (to be continued).</p>
<h3>American Ambassador to Japan Arrives in Shenyang</h3>

<h3>Local Correspondence, Fengxian</h3>
<p>Salt Police Clash with Militia Members Due to Misunderstanding The Songchang Salt Bureau dispatched plainclothes police officers yesterday to search for salt smugglers in the Jinfei Bridge area of ​​the county. The villagers, seeing that they were not in uniform, feared other motives and asked the local militia to investigate. The police officers then brandished their guns as a show of force, leading to a clash. Fortunately, Zhang Dongcang, the Chief of the Public Security Branch Bureau, strongly persuaded them and disarmed the police officers, thus preventing a disaster. The Song Bureau has now sent a letter of verification for their release.</p>

<p>Bizarre Disappearance of Education Committee Member Jiang Zhizhou Jiang Zhizhou, a member of the Education Committee of the Sixth School District of this county, is a native of Heliekou, Kaiyuan Township, Fourth District. He is 26 years old and from a family of modest means. On the 3rd of this month, he took his own chartered car to the steamboat dock under the Gongyun Bridge, intending to take a boat to Zhangshe to attend the principals' meeting of the Sixth School District. He also carried $400 in cash to distribute to the principals. However, the early morning boat had already left, and the late boat was not scheduled to depart until 2:30 PM in the afternoon. Jiang thought it was still early, so he told the carter, Xiao Long, to return home first. It was not until 10:00 AM on the 4th that several principals from the Fuan Township primary schools suddenly came to the Education Bureau, saying that Jiang had originally arranged to hold a meeting on the 3rd to distribute funds, but had not arrived by 8:00 PM that day, so they came to the city today to collect the funds. Upon hearing this, the Education Bureau immediately sent someone to Jiang's house in Heliekou to inquire, but he had not returned. The Bureau was greatly alarmed and sent people out in all directions to search, but no trace was found. However, Jiang's sudden disappearance is quite bizarre. It is now heard that his relatives have spread news among friends that there is some clue to Jiang's whereabouts. It is unknown whether he will be able to return home safely.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Conspire to Steal Large Sums of Money There is a man named Wu Qianchen from Jiangyin, who used to work in the Manyun Cloth Factory in his hometown. Yesterday morning, he took a boat to Wuxi, intending to transfer to Shanghai. After arriving at the boat pier, he hired Chen Kaiwu's rickshaw to go to the train station. Wu placed a leather bag and a clothing bag he was carrying on the rickshaw. The rickshaw puller claimed that he could put the leather bag behind the seat and ordered Wu to hold his hands high to support it. Wu believed him to be true. Suddenly, he felt a looseness beside him. While the rickshaw was traveling, the rickshaw puller, Chen Kaiwu, suddenly claimed that it was time to hand over the rickshaw and was unwilling to go further, so he replaced Wu with Xu Xiaoliuzi's rickshaw to pull. When Wu arrived at the station, he suddenly felt for a wallet in his pocket, but it was gone. It contained $125 in cash, $5 in silver dollars, and two drafts for 600 taels of silver, totaling a loss of over $1,000. He ordered the rickshaw puller to pull the rickshaw back to the boat pier, and caught a glimpse of Chen Kaiwu fleeing. He immediately called the police and arrested the two rickshaw pullers at the Public Security Second Branch Bureau under its jurisdiction. After preliminary interrogation by Branch Chief Sun, Chen and Xu both denied conspiring to steal the money. Chief Sun verified the confessions and submitted a document to the General Bureau for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<p>Electricity Prices in the Urban Area to Increase The electricity used by businesses in the urban area from the Qishuyan Power Plant was originally 18 cents per kilowatt-hour with a 10% discount, effectively 16.2 cents. Since the price of gold has soared, the cost has greatly increased. The plant has canceled the discount. Although businesses have requested that the original discount be maintained, it has not been approved. The plant has been sending people out to collect fees at the full price of 18 cents for several days. However, many businesses are still waiting and suspending payment in order to continue their request.</p>
<p>The Kidnapped Hostages from Fenshuidun Have Completely Escaped The Fenshuidun area on the border of Yixing, Wujin, and Yixing counties was looted by bandits in the middle of the night on the 16th of last month, and five men and women were kidnapped. Except for Wu Runfu and Zhang Jinhai, who have already escaped by design, there are still three people, including Wang Wenlin, the owner of Taiyi South Goods Store, a woman named Liu Shishi, and her daughter A Pang. Because the ransom demanded by the bandits was too large, their families were unable to redeem them, so they were still held in the bandit den. It is now learned that after Wang Wenlin and others were kidnapped, they were initially guarded on Maji Mountain for about a week, and then moved to a straw shed in Changxing County. The guards were an old bandit and two old women. Recently, the silkworms raised by the bandits were about to spin cocoons, which was extremely busy. They were very tired and fell asleep at night. The day before yesterday, in the middle of the night, Wang Wenlin took the opportunity to escape first. In the dark, he ran to a coal mining company on the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway, informed the gate guard, and telegraphed the Changxing County Public Security Bureau. The Bureau sent 30 police officers, led by Wang, to the bandit den. The bandits who were guarding had also become aware and prepared to resist. After the police fired live ammunition, the bandits were killed on the spot, and the hostages Liu Shishi and her daughter A Pang were rescued. Two pistols were also found in the bandit den, and the female bandit was escorted to the Bureau for interrogation. After questioning, the police were ordered to send Wang Wenlin, Liu Shishi, and A Pang back home. They arrived home safely yesterday.</p>

<p>Major Fire on Taiping Bridge Street At 3:00 AM today, a fire broke out in the Taihe Pharmacy on Taiping Bridge Street in the city center due to carelessness with fire. It spread to the nearby Xinhua Bookstore, Yangchuntang Pharmacy, Wang Yongtai Hat and Shoe Store, Pingquan Tea House, and Runcheng Tea and Paint Store, Ding Dexing Cotton and Linen Store, Taihe Candle Store, and Yihetai Tea and Paint Store across the street, totaling eleven stores. The estimated loss is over 100,000 yuan. The Police Team Arrested a Bandit Suspect Chen Bangzhen from Wujin County served as a primary school teacher in Zheliu Bridge in the eastern township of this county. He has now been accused of banditry at the County Government. After receiving the report, County Chief Shen secretly ordered the police team to rush to arrest Chen. He has now been escorted to the case.</p>
<p>A Female Corpse Found in Lucheng River A female corpse was found in the river west of the Chenghuang Temple Bridge north of Lucheng Town. After being spotted by a villager, the Lucheng Public Security Branch Bureau retrieved the corpse. She was about thirty years old, wearing a purple-red serge close-fitting garment and Yuan-colored cloth-padded pants. Her hands and legs were tightly bound with ropes, and a large stone was tied to her back. She was murdered before being thrown into the river. The case has now been reported to the county for investigation.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Province's Rice and Grain Difficult to Export The Jiangsu Provincial Food Management Committee held its fourth meeting yesterday, chaired by Ge Jianshi, to discuss the Shanghai Municipal Government's request for 200 passports, each for 500 piculs, totaling 100,000 piculs of sea rice, to be transported to nine major commercial ports such as Shantou in Guangdong for sale, submitted by the Provincial Government. According to Article 3 of the Provisional Measures for Rice and Grain Export from the Province, which was approved by the Provincial Government, the standard rice price is 11 yuan per picul of sea rice. According to reports from Songjiang, Wuxi, Liyang, Rugao, Yancheng, Gaoyou, and other counties obtained by this committee, the amount of rice and grain stored in this province is not much, and the current rice price has already exceeded the standard price of 13 yuan or more. It can be asserted that, based on the above reasons, it is difficult to approve exports. A letter will be sent to the Provincial Government to reply to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>

<p>The Death of a Knife Society Master The Knife Society master Yang Dengke, who transported ships on the canal, has always taught the crew members magic, claiming that he can avoid the harm of knives and guns. Last month, the merchants and residents of the Banzha Town in Huai'an were uneasy after being robbed by bandits, so they sent several representatives to Pu to invite Dengke to teach them in the town street, hoping to use it for defense. Dengke, in order to spread his evil skills, agreed to go with them. Yesterday, Dengke set up a hall in the town to teach. According to the usual practice, there should be a "row of knives" (that is, testing the magic on the body of the person being taught with a knife). Dengke, in order to strengthen the belief of the local people, first swallowed many charms and ordered others to use a gun instead of a knife to test him first. He fired two shots in a row, and neither hit. With the third shot, the bullet pierced Dengke's abdomen, and blood gushed out. Everyone was terrified. He was carried to Renci Hospital here for treatment. Unfortunately, the injury was too severe and long-lasting. He died shortly after entering the hospital.</p>

Zhang has not yet arrived. He has been strictly limited to surrender. If he does not surrender, the land will be bidded immediately.</p>
<p>One Pirate Captured The pirate Shen San, under the false command of the bandit leader Yan Zhenling, escorted two bandit coffins to Sanjia Town for burial.

<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Miners Gather to Gamble, Assault Police and Resist Arrest The Changxing Public Security Bureau in Huzhou received a report at around 1:00 PM on the 4th that there was gambling at Wulibao. The Bureau immediately dispatched more than a dozen police officers to arrest them. When they arrived there, there were indeed dozens of gamblers gathered, all of whom were miners. When the workers saw the police arriving, they all took out iron tools to resist arrest. Knowing that they were outnumbered, the police fired in self-defense. As a result, one police officer was killed and one miner was killed. Five or six people on both sides were seriously injured. After the police officers returned to the city, the Bureau invited the stationed Changxing Security Team to lead a team to go, but the local security team mistakenly thought they were bandits, resulting in a firefight for about three hours before it stopped. It is not yet known whether there were any deaths or injuries on both sides. Details will be provided after further investigation.</p>

<h3>Yang Shuzhuang Goes to Nanjing Sick</h3>
<p>It is said that he will meet Chairman Jiang and firmly resign from all positions. According to reliable sources in the navy, Yang Shuzhuang, Minister of the Navy and Chairman of Fujian Province, attended the National Assembly a month ago and presented to Chairman Jiang and Finance Minister Song that Fujian Province's finances were extremely depleted. He has governed Fujian for five years, but all facilities have no solution. He asked for appropriate assistance. It is said that after several consultations, there was no concrete solution. Yang then came to Shanghai for treatment because of hemoptysis and recurrence of old symptoms. Now that Yang is physically weak and needs to recuperate, and it is difficult for him to bear heavy responsibilities, and he has been away from Fujian for a long time, the provincial affairs are busy, so he went to Nanjing the night before last, ill, to visit Chairman Jiang and earnestly resigned from the position of Chairman of Fujian Province, and hired other capable people to preside over it. It is also said that he also firmly resigned from the position of naval chief at the same time. According to reports, Yang has already left Beijing last night.</p>

<h3>Fellow Townsmen in Guangxin Telegraph to Request Troops to Suppress the Communists</h3>
<p>Guangxin Seven Counties Association Express Mail Telegram, Shanghai Newspaper Office Transfer to Nanjing General Commander Jiang, Nanchang Director He, Chairman Lu Jian: The seven counties of Guangxin have been ravaged by communist bandits for five years. The tragic situation has been reported to you by our association in detail. We request you to order the two provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian to send elite troops to encircle and suppress them from three sides and thoroughly solve the problem in order to clear the source of the disaster and stabilize the people. We have repeatedly received replies saying that teams will be sent to suppress them severely. We are very happy to hear this, and hundreds of thousands of disaster victims are celebrating with joy. However, it is known that the bandits are cunning and unpredictable, and they change unpredictably. They flee when suppressed and disperse into zero, so that the seven counties of Guangxin have become ruins in these five years, and there is not a single clean scholar. Thinking of this, my heart is extremely painful. This is why our association cannot remain silent and has the urge to send a telegram. On the same day, we also received a telegram from the Jiangxi Qianshan County Party Affairs Consolidation Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, stating that the public of the Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association of Guangxin Seven Counties are all aware that on the 27th of this month, Zou Qi, a bandit from Shilong, Qianshan, led thousands of people and hundreds of guns, and successively occupied Chenkeng, Shitang, Yangcun, and other places in Shidu for days, burning and killing in a strange and tragic manner, looting and forcing inquiries, but that was just the rest of the matter. The instructor is not here, and Qiancheng is in great danger. We beg the Central Government and General Zuo to send troops, but the telegram ordered us to request directly from Ruan's division, and the distribution of troops is difficult because the power is exhausted, etc. Qianshan is in the hands of the bandits, who will slaughter them at will and watch the city fall. We earnestly request all fellow townsmen in Shanghai to remember the tombs and houses of their ancestors and do their best to expose the truth that the bandits are entrenched in the Da Bu shares of Fang Shao in eastern Jiangxi, and that Hengyi is still rampant, as well as the tragic situation of Zou Qi, a bandit from Shilong, Qianshan, who is now burning and looting, to the authorities to call for help in order to save the crisis and protect their hometown. The Jiangxi Guangxin Seven Counties Fellow Townsmen Association pays its respects, etc. We were shocked and our hearts were broken. Looking forward to our hometown, we couldn't help but shed tears. How can we bear to sit idly by and let it rot? A copy of the original telegram from the association is forwarded to you for your review. We beg you to take pity on hundreds of thousands of people who are trapped in deep water and fire every day, and quickly send elite troops, and order Zhejiang and Fujian to send troops at the same time to encircle and suppress them from three sides, eliminate this murderous demon, and protect our people. The party and the country are fortunate, and the local area is fortunate. We cannot wait to receive your order.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office Negotiates with French Consulate to Extradite Wanted Criminal</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang of the Jiangsu Superintendent's Office previously received complaints from more than 70 households, including Xiao Caiyou, that the bandit Zhi Xiaotao was rampant in Yancheng and Wuxi. After receiving confirmation, he secretly ordered Deputy Adjutant Zhu Xinke to come to Shanghai. On April 3, he was arrested in the French Concession in conjunction with the Yue Capture. During the initial trial, it was clarified that the matter was true. The Commissioner's Office then sent Councilor Zhang Jingxing and others to Shanghai to request extradition so that the case could be concluded as soon as possible, and the more than 70 victimized households, including Xiao Caiyou, who were crying and waiting in Yangzhou, could be spared the trouble. However, for two months, the French Gendarmerie has repeatedly delayed the extradition. The day before yesterday, Zhang Shusheng, Chief Councilor of the Commissioner's Office, visited the French Consul General Gan Gelin to negotiate, and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also received a consultation from the Commissioner's Office. The day before yesterday, Section Chief Zhao Tiezhang and Staff Officer Zhang Jingxing of the office negotiated with the French Consul. They were received by the French Deputy Consul Ge Dang, but there were no results. It is said that the Commissioner's Office believes that Zhi Xiaotao's crimes and residence were not in the French Concession, and the evidence of the crimes is conclusive. The delay in extradition is disrespectful to our country's government officials and prevents the more than 70 victims from appealing. Therefore, it will consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the French envoy seriously.</p>
<h3>Industry Department Prepares to Promote New-Style Bookkeeping</h3>
<p>Sends Letter Asking Accountants to Draft Methods. The Ministry of Industry previously approved a submission from the Shanghai Accountants Association requesting the unification of the national accounting system and, in accordance with the resolutions of the National Industry and Commerce Conference, the promotion of new-style bookkeeping to facilitate national industrial and commercial statistics. It has now sent a letter to renowned accountants Xie Lin, Li Cheng, Xi Yushu, Chen Riping, and Xu Yongzuo, asking them to draft methods for promoting and unifying new-style bookkeeping. Enclosed is the original letter, which reads as follows: "Regarding the resolution of the National Industry and Commerce Conference to promote new-style bookkeeping to facilitate national industrial and commercial statistics, after the conference adjourned, it was communicated to the provincial and municipal governments for their information and instructions to the responsible authorities and merchant organizations to draft outlines and implement them step by step to achieve universal adoption. Subsequently, the provincial and municipal governments have complied with these instructions and have occasionally submitted methods for adoption and implementation. However, bookkeeping is a specialized field and a fundamental task for revitalizing industry and commerce. Its methods and implementation steps cannot be determined without a unified design and practical needs. We have long admired your profound knowledge and years of research in bookkeeping. We are sending this special letter to seek your collective wisdom in drafting unified methods for promoting new-style bookkeeping, so that we can communicate them to the provinces and cities for promotion and guidance, and strive for their implementation. We eagerly anticipate your contribution."</p>

<h3>County Construction Bureau Commences Laying of Puxi Telephone Lines</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Construction Bureau had long planned and actively prepared for the construction of long-distance telephone lines connecting the first, second, third, and sixth districts of Puxi under the county's jurisdiction. However, the project required a substantial sum of several thousand yuan, and despite various parties offering subsidies, it was still insufficient. Now, Director Wu, considering that the county seat is about to be relocated and that the construction of telephone lines in various districts is a matter of urgency, has consulted with County Magistrate Yan and temporarily allocated two thousand yuan from the relocation expenses as a subsidy to expedite the project. Director Wu has instructed his subordinates to prepare, and construction will commence soon to facilitate communication.</p>
<h3>Binding Workers Fully Resume Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>Union to Hold Meeting Today to Discuss Aftermath. The strike of Chinese and foreign bookbinding workers in the city ended yesterday, and they have all resumed work as ordered. The union is scheduled to hold a meeting today to discuss the aftermath. The situation yesterday is described below:</p>
<p>Universal Resumption of Work. Over 2,000 workers from more than 150 Chinese and foreign bookbinding workshops, including Ma Hongji, resumed work yesterday after the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus jointly issued a notice ordering them to resume work within three days or be considered voluntarily dismissed. The union, in order to comply with the order, dispatched members of the East, South, West, and North maintenance teams the day before yesterday to persuade the workers to resume work and explain everything. As a result, over 2,000 workers resumed work yesterday. The union has scheduled a joint meeting of the supervisors and directors today to discuss the aftermath.</p>
<p>Workers Released on Bail for Three Days. In the case of the thirteen individuals detained by the Fifth District General Office of the Public Security Bureau for obstructing workers from working at Youren Binding Workshop in Hongxingfang, Hongxing Road, and for causing trouble at the nearby Jinxia Tea House, three workers from the Shenchang Paperboard Factory, Yu Shigen, Tang Afu, and Yang Guisheng, were bailed out yesterday by the factory owner. The remaining ten individuals, including Shu Fuchuan and Xie Shuangxi, have not yet been released. The union is scheduled to send representatives to bail them out tomorrow.</p>
<p>Report Filed for Record. The Bookbinding Workers Union yesterday submitted a report to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "Report Regarding the Resumption of Work by Workers. Due to misunderstandings among the members of this union, a labor strike occurred. We have strictly ordered all workers to comply with the joint notice issued by your bureau and the Municipal Public Security Bureau to resume work by the deadline. All workers have now resumed normal work today in compliance with the order. We are submitting this special report for your review and approval."</p>
<h3>Private Agreements Between Labor and Management in Silk Reeling Industry</h3>
<p>Union Asks for Ban. The Industrial Union of the Silk Reeling Industry in the Third, Fourth, and Sixth Districts of the city recently discovered that several silk factories were privately forcing workers to sign harsh conditions. Yesterday, it specifically submitted a document to the Municipal Training Council and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau requesting a ban. The report stated: "Request for Strict Orders to All Silk Factories to Refrain from Coercing Employees into Privately Signing Harsh Conditions. This union has repeatedly received confidential reports from members stating that during this time of change, factories are using dismissal as a threat to force employees to privately sign various harsh conditions to determine their retention. Employees are under the oppressive power of the factory owners, in a dilemma, and their suffering is unspeakable. Therefore, they request assistance from the union. Upon investigation, this union finds that both labor and management in our silk reeling industry have a complete and legal labor and management treatment agreement. Before it is declared invalid or amended, no one may arbitrarily violate it to satisfy their own selfish desires. Signing under coercion is even more prohibited by law. Today, the factories, under the bright sky and white sun, are disregarding this great injustice and resolutely taking actions to break contracts and oppress workers, which is truly outrageous. For the sake of maintaining legal contracts and protecting workers, this union urgently submits this report, requesting that your esteemed council and bureau promptly issue strict orders to ban all silk factories from coercing employees into privately signing any harsh conditions or contracts, and that those already signed be immediately invalidated in order to maintain labor rights and alleviate workers' distress. This is in the public interest."</p>
<h3>Employees of British-Owned Shanghai Gas Company Demand Pay Raise</h3>
<p>Present Three Reasons for Pay Raise.</p>
<p>Request Employer Reply Within Seven Days. The six hundred employees of the British-owned Shanghai Gas Company at No. 5 Tibet Road in this city have recently demanded a pay raise from the employer due to high prices and difficult living conditions. After three negotiations, no agreement has been reached. Yesterday, the union held an emergency meeting of the standing committee and decided to appoint Bao Yugen and Yao Liankun to be responsible for the negotiations. They took a letter stating the reasons for the pay raise to the company's chief engineer, Mr. Baker, for a final consultation, and requested a reply within a week. The original letter reads: "Dear Sir, Recently, prices have increased to an extreme level, and the workers of the entire factory are compelled by livelihood to request the union to forward their request for a pay raise. The union is saddened by this and has repeatedly requested a pay raise from you, but without success. We have always admired Mr. Baker for his generous treatment of workers, for which the workers are deeply grateful. However, recently, the situation of the workers being compelled by livelihood has become extremely tense. The union has no choice but to write again to request that the wages of all workers be increased generously as a final consultation. We hope that you will reply in writing within a week, otherwise your company will bear full responsibility. We eagerly await your reply. Sincerely, The Shanghai Gas Company Union. Reasons for Pay Raise Attached. (1) Recently, prices have increased, and the workers are compelled by livelihood, making it difficult to work with peace of mind. Therefore, a pay raise should be granted. (2) The wages of foreign employees in this factory have already increased by forty to fifty percent. The Chinese workers in this factory are treated the same and should be given a pay raise accordingly to maintain their livelihood. (3) The price of gas and other items leased by this company have already increased. The company's operating surplus has been reported in the newspapers. For these reasons, and considering the anxious situation of the workers and maintaining the relationship between labor and management, we have no choice but to write again to request a final consultation. We hope that you will give a satisfactory reply within the shortest possible time, otherwise this union cannot bear the heavy responsibility. We hereby declare."</p>
<h3>County Government Urges Township Elections</h3>

<h3>Establishment of the Zhabei Fourth Section Fire Brigade</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Fourth Section Fire Brigade, which has been in preparation since last year, held its official inauguration meeting yesterday morning at 9:00 AM at the World Grand Theater. Attendees included representatives from the Shanghai South District Fire Federation and fire brigades from various districts, including the Dongjiadu, Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhenru, and Hujiamuqiao Fire Brigades from the Second District Fire Brigade, as well as the Zhabei Fire Federation fire brigades from the First, Second, and Third Sections, the 27th Regiment Headquarters, the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, the Sixth Tunnel Security Corps, Deputy Officer Geng representing the 27th Regiment, You Bolu, the district head of the Fifth District, Yu Suqiao representing the municipal government and the Public Security Bureau, Chen Yiting representing the Sixth District Party Headquarters, Zhu Yiqian, a municipal committee member from Yinhang District, Chen Weihan, Yu Zhonghua, Yang Songtao, Shen Chen, Lai Shi, Diao Haochun, Bian Yuying, and hundreds of representatives from various factories and businesses. (1) The ceremony was performed as prescribed. (2) Mr. Yang Caiqing was publicly elected as chairman. (3) The chairman reported on the purpose and progress of the meeting, stating that the Zhabei First, Second, and Third Section Fire Brigades were established in the first year of the Republic of China and have been dedicated to fire prevention with excellent results. Over the past twenty years, the Zhabei area has grown increasingly prosperous, and it seems necessary to expand the fire-fighting organization. Last autumn, residents north of the railway, along Baoshan Road and Baoxing Road, jointly petitioned the municipal government and the Public Security Bureau to organize the Fourth Section Fire Brigade, and they elected Chen Yousheng and others to be responsible for the preparations. I was also mistakenly entrusted with the task of handling the association's affairs. I have no experience in fire prevention and am very ashamed, but this is a public welfare matter, and I have no choice but to follow the lead of the gentlemen. However, at the beginning, my knowledge is limited, and I hope that all the guests will provide guidance at any time. Yu Suqiao then provided guidance, stating that today's inauguration meeting of the Fourth Section Fire Brigade is a great honor for me to attend as a representative of the municipal government and the Public Security Bureau. The establishment of the Fourth Section Fire Brigade is like the birth of a child, very smooth. However, the fire brigade is essentially a volunteer fire department, containing the meaning of courageous acts of righteousness, which is very broad, and the relationship between fire prevention and the people is particularly close. The personnel must work hard and be as brave as soldiers fighting in battle, so that the city's fire prevention can be on par with the fire prevention of other cities, and we can be a leader in the Republic of China.

<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Explains the Harms of Not Registering Companies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Taxi Industry Association, stating: "We received your letter on the 6th of this month stating that many members are still hesitant about registration and requesting that this chamber send a letter to your association to inform members that all those using the name of a company must register in accordance with the law, otherwise they will not be able to obtain a business license issued by the ministry, etc. We have investigated that according to the company's organization, those who have exceeded the deadline and have not applied for registration, the directors and supervisors, etc., should be fined up to 500 yuan in accordance with the law. Also, if the organization is a limited company and does not register in accordance with the law, it will not be allowed to defend against creditors in the name of a limited company in the future in the event of debt litigation. Both of these points are of vital interest to the member companies of your industry, and a slight delay will lead to regret. Your association should explain the above situation to all its members and urge them to register in accordance with the law as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Negotiates Over Postmarks Used to Deceive for Mail Packages</h3>
<p>The Postal Bureau Should Be Held Responsible for Negligence. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Silk and Satin Industry Association stating that Heng Huiji Silk Store had entrusted Yaoji Postal Transportation Company to send silk goods, which had not arrived after the deadline. They requested that the chamber write to the post office to investigate the mailing case. After forwarding the letter to the Postal Administration Bureau for investigation, the Postal Administration Bureau replied on the 5th of this month, stating that Yaoji Company had obtained the post office date stamp by illegal means and deliberately deceived. The post office cannot be held responsible, etc. The association believes that the matter concerns the credibility of postal services, so it sent another letter to negotiate. The original letter is recorded as follows: "On the 5th of this month, your bureau's letter No. 167 stated that Yaoji Company obtained blank receipts from the post office in the past and obtained the post office date stamp by illegal means, privately forging and misusing it to deceive customers, and that the post office cannot be held responsible. The post office date stamp is of utmost importance. How could it fall into the hands of Yaoji Company? While the acquisition was illegal, allowing it to be acquired illegally, even without other circumstances, is a major negligence. If Yaoji Company could not obtain the post office date stamp, it could not have privately forged and misused it to deceive customers. Heng Huiji's deception by Yaoji is not unrelated to the date stamp, and the cause is purely due to the post office's major negligence. On this point alone, it cannot but bear considerable responsibility. We are sending this letter for your investigation and handling. Respectfully, Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau.

<h3>Sand and Gravel Industry Again Requests Cancellation of Sand and Mud Tax</h3>
<p>After the sand and gravel industry in this city launched a market strike due to the construction hall of Zhejiang Province levying a sand and mud production and sales tax, the Ministry of Finance approved an order to cancel the tax. However, the sand and gravel industry believes that Zhejiang Province has not complied with the order and is still levying the tax in a disguised form. Yesterday, the industry association and the sea sand boat owners separately submitted reports to the Control Yuan and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting a complete cancellation. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Report to the Control Yuan. The Sand and Gravel Industry Association reports to the Control Yuan, stating: "Report Regarding the Inventing of Pretexts, the Arbitrary Levying of Oppressive Taxes, Disregarding Government Orders, and Acting Against Orders. We Urgently Request an Order for Cancellation to Maintain Government Orders and Relieve the Distress of Jiangsu Merchants. The Zhejiang Provincial Government's Construction Hall entrusted the checking station of the sand mining and transportation permit issuing office, contracted to Dachang and Yitai Companies, etc., to arbitrarily levy and extort taxes, oppressively burdening merchants and triggering a city-wide strike in the sand and gravel industry. We have submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to cancel the tax. Subsequently, we received a response No. 12804, stating, 'We have received and are aware of the report. We have consulted with the Zhejiang Provincial Government to cancel the tax. Please be informed.' Upon receiving this, the checking station, knowing it was illegal, temporarily suspended the oppressive tax on the industry. On the one hand, it cleverly changed its methods and acted against orders, with Yitai Company individually acknowledging and paying the oppressive tax. On the other hand, it went to Zhejiang Province to contract all the official sand lands, making it impossible for our city's industry to mine any sand, placing the livelihood of tens of thousands of our colleagues in a desperate situation. We believe that Yitai is actually produced by the contractor Dachang. Now it contracts the tax and occupies the official land, which is not allowed by law. Such actions are clearly disregarding government orders, and although the management fee of this disguised tax has been seemingly canceled, the livelihood of the industry is still in a desperate situation. Therefore, we are submitting the old management fee receipts, the new contractor tax receipts, the regulations, and the newspaper reports for your review, urgently requesting an order for the complete cancellation of the newly established management fee of the disguised tax in order to maintain government orders and relieve the distress of Jiangsu merchants. We are urgently submitting this report, hoping that you will approve it as a public service. Respectfully submitted to the President of the Control Yuan Yu."</p>
<p>Report to the Zhejiang Provincial Government. Huang Chongkang, representative of the sea sand boat owners, and others report to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, stating: "Report Regarding the Request for a Further Cancellation of the Disguised Sand and Mud Tax to Comply with Government Orders. The construction hall handles the sand and mud tax, collecting a management fee of five jiao per ton and a sand price of two jiao, contracted by Dachang Company, with the government receiving 60% and the merchants receiving 40%. This is a disguised tax on goods, a disguised form of tariff. The Shanghai Sand and Gravel Industry Association has submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance No. 1276, stating that the Zhejiang Provincial Government should be consulted to investigate and cancel the tax. The contractor not only did not comply with the order to stop collecting the tax, but also implemented various coercive measures, threatening and extorting taxes as usual, clearly disregarding government orders. The livelihood of the boat owners depends entirely on this. Every day that the tax is not canceled, they will suffer a day's loss. How can we, the poor people, bear this? Moreover, newspaper reports state that the Ningbo County Government's collection of stone tax has caused a storm, and the governor has ordered the cancellation. The sand and mud tax is the same. Yuan Kang and others have submitted documents to the governor requesting a clear order for cancellation, but no instructions have been received. We are terrified. Therefore, we reiterate the previous situation, pleading with the governor to consider the livelihood of the boat owners and grant a clear order to cancel the collection offices and management fees, sand prices, and other items in Shanghai Wusong Qushan Zhujiaxing, etc., to comply with government orders. We are urgently awaiting orders. Respectfully submitted to Zhang, the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, by Huang Yuankang, Yi Shenzhi, Dong Yuesheng, Shan Fufa, and Shan Axiu, Zhejiang sea sand boat owners."</p>
<h3>Distribution of Silk Industry Public Bonds and Improvement of Machinery</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Silk Merchants Have Different Opinions. According to Article 3 of the Silk Industry Public Bonds regulations, one-quarter of the recently issued silk industry public bonds is to be used to improve silk factory machinery. The total amount of the public bonds is eight million yuan, so one-quarter should be two million yuan. However, the method of distributing this two million yuan has not been resolved after discussions between the Ministry of Industry and the silk merchants, and the dispute between the two sides is very fierce. The Ministry of Industry's improvement plan and the silk merchants' opinions are described below:</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry's Plan. According to Cheng Zhenjun, Director of the Ministry of Industry, the use of the two million yuan for improving silk factory machinery from the silk industry public bonds, as announced to the Xin Sheng News Agency, is as follows: (1) Allocate all two million yuan to machine manufacturing factories to manufacture new-style silk reeling machines, which will be sold at cost. (2) Use two million yuan to open a central model silk factory and one million yuan to reward the improvement of silk reeling machines. The reward standards are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) For those who use new-style improved silk reeling machines or retrofit new-style improved silk reeling machines, whose raw silk output is above 80 points (such as the Japanese Gunma upright silk reeling machine, the Mikata silk reeling machine, or other machines with equivalent effectiveness), each machine will be rewarded with 12 yuan in public bonds. A total of 720,000 yuan in public bonds is allocated, planning to replace all of the more than 50,000 old silk machines in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and reward more than 10,000 new silk machines. (B) For those who equip improved cocoon drying stoves (such as the Italian simple air heat type, the Japanese belt type, and other machines with equivalent effectiveness), each stove will be rewarded with 400 yuan in public bonds. A total of 190,000 yuan in public bonds is allocated, which can reward 475 stoves. (C) For those who equip new-style improved cocoon boiling machines or improve cocoon boiling machines (such as the Japanese Chiba type and other machines with equivalent effectiveness), each machine will be rewarded with 300 yuan in public bonds. A total of 90,000 yuan in public bonds is allocated, which can reward 300 machines. (3) Use one million yuan to open a model silk factory and one million yuan to machine manufacturing factories to manufacture new-style silk reeling machines, which will be sold at cost. (4) Use one million yuan to machine manufacturing factories to manufacture new-style silk reeling machines, which will be sold at cost, and one million yuan to reward the improvement of silk reeling machines, as stated in Article 2.</p>
<p>Silk Merchants' Opinions. The Xin Sheng News Agency visited Mr. Shen Huachen, a silk industry leader who attended the distribution committee meeting, to ask about the silk merchants' opinions on this issue. According to him, improving machinery to develop the silk industry is essential, but there are three essential factors for improving raw silk production. It is difficult to make progress if only attention is paid to machinery. It is necessary to train workers and improve raw materials at the same time, otherwise the machines, even if improved, will still have no effect. Silk reeling is not mainly mechanical work. Besides power and equipment, it all depends on manual techniques. This is commonly known. Now, it is against the principle to use the funds for improving machines from the public bonds of the silk industry, which are borrowed by merchants and repaid by merchants. The reason why the silk merchants requested the issuance of public bonds is that they have been affected by the Japanese silk market over the years, resulting in failures and losses that have reached the point of bankruptcy. Therefore, they have had no choice but to make this request. The reasons why the silk merchants are requesting a delay in the necessary improvement are as follows: (1) Whether the issue of improving machinery is currently necessary is worthy of study. Chinese silk is sold to France and the United States. France welcomes Italian-style machine-reeled silk (existing machines). The United States is happy to use Japanese-style machine-reeled silk, but does not refuse to buy Italian-reeled silk. Therefore, when sales to the United States are completely suspended, there are still sales to France. Otherwise, wouldn't we be throwing the baby out with the bathwater? (2) Furthermore, the silk industry in China: most silk manufacturers do not own the factory. They rent the factory. Now the silk merchants are using the money borrowed at high interest rates to fix the machines for the landlord. Is this reasonable? (3) The issuance of these public bonds is eight million yuan, but the total amount that must be repaid, including interest, is more than ten million and forty thousand yuan, and only four million yuan is distributed to the silk merchants who are in need of relief. Moreover, as a temporary measure, the silk merchants advocate for a change in the two million yuan for improving machinery and for its implementation to be delayed. (4) Assuming that two million yuan is used to improve machinery, it will be distributed to more than 50,000 silk machines (27,000 in Shanghai, 15,000 in Wuxi, 7,800 in Zhejiang, and 2,500 in Zhenjiang, etc.). Each machine will receive only 40 yuan in face value, and sold at 70% off, the actual amount is 28 yuan. How much effect can this have in improving the situation?</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption from Waste Yarn Tax</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Nanjing Ministry of Finance: According to a letter from the Flying Print Industry Association, the Chengsheng Flower Factory contracts all the flying flowers to the Tongyi Silk Factory. There is a type of waste yarn, and the tax bureau officials stationed in the factory order it to be taxed in the same way, and are not allowed to ship it. The Association requests that the waste yarn, which is waste material left over from the yarn factory, not be included in the scope of the unified tax, and requests exemption. According to Article 3, Items A and B, of the unified tax regulations, waste yarn is indeed not included. Comparing it with the 48th category of the Provisional Tax Regulations makes this even clearer. Please telegraph the Unified Tax Administration to instruct the cessation of taxation. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<h3>Appeal for the Tragedy of Shangcheng Being Devastated by the Communists</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram from Chairman Zhang Fang of the Henan Province Relief Committee:</p>
<p>"The Chinese Red Cross Society: It has been investigated that Shangcheng has been captured twice in recent years. Communist bandits in the territory have established Soviet reactionary governments and Red Army headquarters and other institutions, expanded propaganda, disrupted order, massacred the innocent, and coerced farmers and workers. All bad elements have been turned into bandits. Wealthy households have long been exiled to faraway places. People are particularly bewildered and in a state of extreme danger. According to successive oral accounts from refugees who have escaped, burning, killing, raping, and looting have been extremely tragic. The situation of being trampled upon is heartbreaking to hear. Our committee has previously allocated 3,000 yuan for emergency relief and is sending personnel to distribute it. However, it is a drop in the bucket and difficult to save all lives. Special relief should be urgently provided to win over people's hearts and prevent them from being used by communist bandits. The Society is known for its benevolence and concern for the hungry and drowning. It is hoped that the Society will consider the people of Shangcheng, who have been in dire straits for a long time and are stretching their necks in hope of rescue, and will quickly provide relief to save the people from disaster. Zhang Fang of the Henan Province Relief Committee."</p>
<h3>The Alarming Import of Large Quantities of Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>Although Cuban sugar, Cuban white sugar, is also sold to China, it is not as much as Japanese sugar and Javanese sugar imported. It is now heard that the Cuban sugar industry is seeking to expand sales in the Far East in order to compete with Japanese and Dutch sugar. Cuban sugar merchants have specially sent representatives to Shanghai to discuss sales methods with Chinese sugar merchants and to establish operating agencies in Shanghai. They are striving to facilitate market prices, transportation, and delivery. It is heard that a large quantity of goods has already been sold in Shanghai and will be shipped in installments. The first batch of 400,000 tons is being shipped to Shanghai for distribution to various ports along the Yangtze River. This news was learned by Yamashita, a Japanese shipping merchant in Shanghai, who sought to obtain the transportation rights for this large shipment of 400,000 tons and is making vigorous and secret efforts to contract with the sugar merchants. He plans to send dozens of ships to load the sugar to China. However, American shipping merchants are also competing for the transportation.</p>
<p>Australian wheat is being shipped to China for the first time in history. Yamashita Company alone has loaded more than 40 ships, each with a wheat value of 500,000 to 600,000 taels of Shanghai silver. Tianxiang Foreign Company has also loaded more than 10 ships, each with about 80,000 to 100,000 bags. This large amount of foreign wheat is mostly purchased by Chinese flour mills, with a total value of more than 40 million yuan. According to people in Yamashita Company, their ships account for eight-tenths of the total amount. The freight alone can amount to 7 million yuan and it is said that the shipping will be completed within this month.</p>
<p>After the strike at the Kailu Coal Mine in Japan caused the suspension of operations, the Shanghai coal market was almost entirely controlled by the Japanese. The amount of Kailu coal sold and transported to Shanghai each month was consistently over 170,000 tons. However, starting in March, the amount was greatly reduced. In that month, the amount of Kailu coal decreased by 80,000 tons, while Fushun coal and Mentou coal jumped to 116,000 tons, an increase of 69,600 tons compared to normal times. Japanese Mitsui coal also jumped to more than 80,000 tons. Our country's Shanyi coal, which used to sell 20,000 tons, was reduced to 4,000 tons due to the pressure of Japanese coal. In total, Shanghai uses about 230,000 tons to 300,000 tons of coal per month, and more than seven-tenths of it is now occupied by the Japanese, so the coal market is considered to be very dangerous. Now that the Kailu strike has been resolved, Japanese merchants will no longer be able to monopolize the market.</p>
<h3>Labor Unions Must Report and Register According to Law</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department's People's Training Committee and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, under orders to reorganize the city's labor unions in accordance with the Labor Union Law, have now completed the reorganization. All the unions have been established, but only 27 unions have registered and obtained licenses in accordance with the law as of yesterday. There are still many unions that have not reported for registration. The committee and bureau jointly issued a notice yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>"Regarding the joint notice, it is stipulated in Article 5 of the Labor Union Law that labor unions that have not been registered are not protected. Because some of the labor unions established in this city have still not reported for registration, this joint notice is urgently issued. All labor unions in this city that have been established under the guidance and supervision of this bureau must obtain a certificate of soundness from this committee within three weeks of establishment and submit it to this bureau for registration. Those established before the issuance of this notice must apply for a certificate and submit it within a certain period. Those who fail to report within the deadline will not be protected. All labor unions in this city must comply and not neglect this matter."</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Ring Leader Shuai Zhongping Escorted to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The leader of the kidnapping gang, Shuai Zhongping, had repeatedly committed major crimes in Shanghai. The police previously cracked the case, captured his son, and arrested the remaining gang members.</p>
<p>However, the main criminal fled far away. He was later found hiding in Tianjin, and police were sent to arrest him. It is reported that Chief Detective Liu of the General Patrol House personally escorted him back, and the prisoner has now arrived in Shanghai. In addition to Shuai, there are several other gang members, it is said.</p>
<h3>Fire at Datong Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 5 a.m., a fire broke out suddenly at the Fuxingxiang Grocery Store at No. 509 Yaojiazhai Bridge on Datong Road in Zhabei due to carelessness. Thick smoke filled the air, and the flames quickly broke through the roof. Fortunately, firefighters from various sections rushed to the scene and worked hard to extinguish the fire. It took half an hour to put out the fire, and it did not spread to neighboring houses. However, the Fuxingxiang's two-bay storefront was completely destroyed. The fire victim, Zhao Chang, a native of Pudong, and his apprentice, Yu Laisheng, were arrested by the patrol police and taken to the Fourth District Headquarters. According to Zhao, the store owner, Zhao Miaofa, returned to his hometown for business and did not know how the fire started. He said that the store had fire insurance for 3,000 taels. According to Yu, he was sleeping downstairs and was afraid that the fire in the stove had not been extinguished and had fallen into the goods, causing the fire. They were sent to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Small Fire at Old White Ferry</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 1:20 p.m., a fire broke out suddenly in the chimney of the Wantai Feng Confectionery Store at No. 64 Old White Ferry. The fire quickly spread, burning fiercely in the wind and breaking through the roof. Firefighters from various districts rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire in 20 minutes. About one room on the upper floor was burned, and the loss was small.</p>
<h3>Four Bodies Found Floating in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>In the past two days, four bodies, large and small, were found in the Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek.

<h3>Two Summer Season Medicines from Yonghe Company</h3>
<p>In addition to manufacturing various cosmetics that sell well in domestic and foreign ports, the Yonghe Industrial Company has also had Dr. Ye Meijun, a chemical doctor from the factory, dedicatedly research and develop various chemical products. Those that have already been released to the market include the Yue Ai Chang'e brand mosquito coils and the Bilibi insecticide. The mosquito coils are packaged in boxes and have a strong medicinal effect and great insecticidal power, so once lit, mosquitoes and insects can be eliminated. It is said that major stores across the country are selling them. The Bilibi insecticide is bottled, with each bottle containing more than half a pound of insecticide. This water has the greatest effect in killing bedbugs and fleas and does not hinder hygiene. Although it is the first time it has been released, it has been sold widely. Those who suffer from bedbugs in this summer season should each prepare a bottle.</p>
<h3>Principles of Revolution to Be Published</h3>
<p>Zhu Xiaochun, a revolutionary youth, is rich in revolutionary thought. Because he believes that scholars in the East and West lack a consistent spirit in their revolutionary theories, he has devoted several years of effort to compile the revolutionary theories of various scholars from China and abroad, ancient and modern, into a book entitled "Principles of Revolution." The entire book is about 90,000 words and is divided into eight chapters, covering the meaning, elements, purpose, work, morality, prevention, outlook on life, and social outlook of revolution. Professor Chen Guyuan wrote in the preface that these problems often appear in people's minds, and few people at home and abroad have systematically criticized them, theoretically described them, or explained them with principles.</p>
<p>It is truly a regrettable matter. Now Comrade Zhu has completely solved these many problems and deserves to be commended. It is reported that with the introduction of Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the book will be generally distributed by the Modern Bookstore and is expected to be published at the end of July. The actual price is 8 jiao of silver. Those who wish to inquire about the detailed chapters of the book or make advance reservations (at half price) should send their inquiries to Jingye Middle School, Xiaodongmen, for forwarding.</p>
<h3>Gifts from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at the Opening of the Market</h3>
<p>The Paris Cosmetics and Pharmaceutical Factory presented the gifts to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in this port which is preparing a grand national products market. It has been recorded in previous newspapers that the market recently held an opening ceremony. The Paris Cosmetics and Pharmaceutical Factory in this port was founded by overseas Chinese who returned from Honolulu, so its products are excellent and its methods are good.

<h3>Two Sailing Ships Return</h3>
<p>Sailing Community Welcomes Them at Songjiang</p>
<p>The General Association Hosts a Celebration Banquet The two sailing yachts, "Crichton" and "Nidaros," which ventured to test the vast ocean and made a trip to Nagasaki, have now completed their mission and safely returned to Shanghai on Saturday evening. The "Crichton," commanded by Mr. Austed, arrived at its original berth at 7 PM the day before yesterday. The "Nidaros," led by Mr. Allison, crossed the mouth of the Songjiang River eight hours later than the "Crichton." Unable to enter the port that night, it arrived in the morning of Sunday. The round trip covered approximately 1,000 miles. The journey from Shanghai to Nagasaki took 136 hours. The return trip was faster due to favorable winds at sea. The "Crichton" took only 103 hours, setting a rare record of sailing 160 miles in a single day. Yesterday, the sailing community in Shanghai, upon hearing the news, went to the mouth of the Songjiang River to welcome and accompany them back to Shanghai. The Shanghai Yachting Association immediately held an annual banquet to celebrate their success. The safe and uneventful round trip demonstrated that although China and Japan are separated by the sea, sailing larger yachts between the two countries is not difficult. Seeing the success of the two yachts, many yachtsmen in Shanghai are eager to try, and it is expected that many will follow suit and embark on long voyages after the success of the two.</p>
<h3>Advance Notice of the Completion Ceremony of the Du Ancestral Hall</h3>

On the morning of the 10th, the ancestral tablets will be welcomed into the hall. Mr. Du is generous and righteous, with friends all over the world. The event is sure to be a grand occasion. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reception arrangements: On the 10th and 11th, guests going to Pudong will take the special steamer provided by the Du residence from the Swire Bund Public Security Wharf in the French Concession. All those who send gifts have been compiled into a guest list according to their surnames. Guests will be asked for their names on the steamer. After landing, guests will be invited to take the prepared cars or rickshaws to the ancestral hall. Those who are not guests will not be invited. Upon entering the hall, guests will sign the guest book and receive a badge.</p>
<p>Division of duties: The ceremony will be grand, and a large number of guests are expected. Mr. Du's friends have made special arrangements to divide the duties in order to facilitate the event and avoid confusion. A list of temporary staff is drawn up below: (General Affairs Directors) Yu Qiaqing, Huang Jinrong; (Entertainment Director) Zhang Xiaolin; (Hygiene Directors) Wang Xiaolai, Wang Peiyuan, Pang Jingzhou; (Document Directors) Yang Xizi, Tang Feiyu; (Banquet Director) Yu Yefeng; (Reception Director) Yuan Ludeng; (Accounting Directors) Yang Yusheng, Zhu Buqing;</p>

<p>Military and police protection: The military and police authorities, as well as the security guards, have made strict arrangements for security. Sentries will be placed at all key points around the ancestral hall to prevent petty theft. There will be no concerns about the safety of guests. However, Mr. Zhang Xiaolin suggested that female guests should not wear</p>
<p>valuable jewelry, lest they be lost due to the large number of guests, causing unnecessary trouble.</p>
<p>Representative of the Minister of Foreign Affairs: Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting has sent his secretary, Mr. Liu Yunfang, to Shanghai to represent him at the completion ceremony of the Du Ancestral Hall.

<h3>Bizarre Tale of a Capsized Boat</h3>
<p>No Strong Winds or Waves</p>
<p>The Boat Simply Overturned At 12:40 AM yesterday morning, the Shanghai Tugboat Company's No. 3 Wharf in Pudong suddenly erupted with cries for help. Su Jinlong, a Chinese constable No. 73 from the Customs Water Police Station, was patrolling the river when he heard the cries and rushed to investigate. He saw a wharf boat capsized in the river, with a man standing on the bottom of the boat. The man claimed to be the captain of the capsized boat, which was carrying 160 packages of cow bones to Zhangjiabang Wharf. Due to the darkness, they had stopped sailing. Without any strong winds or waves, the boat suddenly capsized, and all the cow bones sank to the bottom of the river. He was quick-witted and escaped, but the cook was still trapped inside the cabin, etc. Upon hearing this, the constable quickly obtained an axe from a neighboring boat and cut a large hole in the bottom of the boat, rescuing the cook. Because there was not much time, he had not yet drowned. However, the inexplicable capsizing of the boat was indeed a strange occurrence, and all who saw it marveled.</p>
<h3>French Concession Changes Street Names</h3>
<p>Effective September 1st</p>
<p>Route Belot and Route Picardie The French Concession Board of Directors believes that the newly built roads in the concession are directly connected to existing roads. For example, the Dumer Avenue section of the newly built Route Champion and Route Pichon is directly connected to Route Pichon. Furthermore, the Paul Beau Road section of Route Béthune and Route Pichelin is directly connected to Route Henriot. It seems incomprehensible that roads that are directly connected have the same name as oblique roads. The Board of Directors, recognizing the need to change the street names, has decided to correct the street names: (1) The Dumer Avenue section of Route Champion and Route Pichon will be renamed Route Pichon. (2) The Paul Beau Road section of Route Béthune and Route Pichelin will be renamed Route Henriot. (3) To avoid confusion with Rue de Verdun, Route Henriot will be renamed Route Lyautey. All changes will be effective on September 1st of this year, and residents of the respective roads will be notified at that time. Furthermore, the Board of Directors, recognizing that Rue Belot has become increasingly prosperous in recent years, with increasing traffic congestion, had previously proposed to the Public Works Committee to widen the road surface to 50 feet to facilitate traffic.</p>

The speakers who followed were Gesang, Ze Ren, Huang Renzhi, Huang Yue, Hua Lianpu of Northeast University, and Lu Lihua, among others. The speeches were lengthy, but the main points were to develop the borderlands, immigrate and cultivate, and report on the current situation in the southwest, northwest, and northeast. Lu Lihua reported on the situation of this eastern expedition. The event ended at around 3 PM.</p>
<h3>German Sexologist's Lecture on Sex and Crime</h3>

<h3>Reasons for the High Price of Rice</h3>
<p>Unscrupulous Merchants Are Illegally Exporting Again</p>
<p>Authorities Should Stop It As Soon As Possible Recently, the price of rice in both the northern and southern markets in Shanghai has suddenly gradually increased. In the past week alone, it has risen by as much as half a yuan. Yesterday, the highest price for white rice sold in the northern market was 14.6 yuan per stone, followed by 14.4 yuan and 14 yuan. Thin rice was sold for 13.5 yuan and 13.2 yuan per stone, an increase of about 20 cents compared to the previous day. According to people in the rice industry, the reason for the recent rise in market prices is that unscrupulous merchants are secretly exporting large quantities of rice again. The rice is collected directly from villages in Wuxi, Changshu, and other places. As a result, the supply to Shanghai has suddenly become scarce, and demand exceeds supply, causing market prices to rise sharply. Yesterday, it was also heard from people from Wuxi that the leading unscrupulous merchants involved in this large-scale rice export have been placed under surveillance by the authorities in Wuxi.</p>
<h3>The Extortion Gangster Cai Weicai Once Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Related to the Kidnapping of Wei Tingrong</p>
<p>Allowed to be handed over to the French Concession police for interrogation Zhong Jintao, a doctor in Nanjing Road's Fragrant Powder Alley, reported to the Old Zha Police Station that he had received a threatening letter demanding 3,000 yuan. The police arrested a gangster from Hangzhou named Jin Fuming, who was escorted to the Special District Local Court for investigation, as previously reported. It is now known that the gangster is actually from Pudong, named Cai Weicai. In June of the previous year, he and his gang kidnapped Wei Tingrong, the leader of the French Concession's Chinese Volunteer Corps. The Seventh Police Station investigated strictly, so he changed his name. After his arrest this time, the police immediately sent detectives to arrest his accomplice, Xu Boyan, at No. 21 Qingyun Lane, Tiantong Road, but Xu had already fled. The case was continued by Judge Zhou of the Special Court the day before yesterday. First, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the results of the investigation, saying that Xu Boyan had fled without a trace, and no one was taking care of his residence and furniture. He asked for instructions on how to deal with it. The French Concession Police Station, due to the Wei case occurring on Catholic Church Street in the French Concession, sent detectives to the court to request transfer of the defendant for interrogation. The defendant admitted to sending the letter to defraud but still denied the kidnapping of Wei. Judge Zhou then sentenced him to four years imprisonment for attempted fraud, confiscated the threatening letter, and temporarily stored the appliances in the house at No. 21 Qingyun Lane in the court's property warehouse. The French Concession Police Station was allowed to take the prisoner for the kidnapping case, and send him back to prison after interrogation.</p>
<h3>Detective Encountered a Robbery</h3>
<p>Immediately Arrested the Perpetrators and Accomplices Together Several years ago, the Fourth Bank's warehouse was robbed of a large sum of money. The police have successively arrested more than ten robbers, who have been convicted. The only one who has not been sentenced is A Wei De, who was recently arrested and is still under investigation. However, there are still several accomplices in the case who have evaded arrest. The day before yesterday afternoon, Yan Kuang, a detective from the Old Zha Police Station, was walking along Guangdong Road when he encountered Zhang Shiming (also known as Xiao Jin), a member of the robbery gang. He immediately arrested Zhang and Wu Wencai, who was walking with Zhang. After interrogation, they were detained. They are now awaiting a joint trial with A De and will be sent to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Two Constables Accused of Assault</h3>
<p>Verdict: Not Guilty Xie Fengren Rice Store was originally located near North Henan Road, Hai Ning Road.</p>
<p>In April of this year, it moved to the intersection of New Gate Road and Changsha Road, transferring the original store to Du, to open Du Shengchang Cloth Store. On the 19th of last month, Du suddenly went to Xie Fengren, saying that the electricity bill had been miscalculated at the time of handover, and invited Yang Zishan, the rice store's accountant, to go to the Shanghai Electric Power Company for review. Yang firmly refused because it was late, which led to an argument. Du went outside and called constables Cai Shixi, No. 1666, and Yan Sishan, No. 1817, to arrest Yang. Zhang Gengsheng, a partner in the rice store, also participated in the dispute. The constables arrested Yang and Zhang and sent them to the Special District Local Court, which sentenced each to a fine of 15 yuan. Subsequently, Yang and others filed a separate lawsuit against the two constables, accusing them of assault on the way to the police station. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao of the Special Court summoned both parties for interrogation. Finding that the plaintiff's accusations were not established, he ruled that Cai and Yan were not guilty.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Narcotics Seized on Rue Krée</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police's newly formed Anti-Opium Squad seized 200,000 anti-opium pills at No. 16 Rue Krée on Saturday and arrested six people, who will be handed over to the court for trial on Monday. The building had a cotton store on the outside. After the detectives searched the interior, they first discovered a large quantity of pills in wooden boxes, and then they found equipment for manufacturing pills and two trays of opium soil. The shopkeeper and partners were all taken back to the police station. The pills were nominally for anti-opium use, but they actually contained a large amount of narcotics and were often sold in large quantities at a high price.</p>
<h3>Young Man Who Drowned at Sea Identified</h3>
<p>Real Name Gao Liping</p>
<p>Not Wang Weiyuan Recently, the Wusongkou Lifesaving Bureau patrol boat recovered the body of a young man from the Huangpu River. A suicide note expressing a breakup in love and a long-term Shanghai Park pass with the name Wang Weiyuan were found on his body, as reported in the May 27th edition of this newspaper. After examination by the court, the body was placed in a coffin and taken to the paupers' cemetery. It is now known that yesterday afternoon, seven or eight friends of the deceased, including Wang Zhenbo and Gao Mengzhi, went to Wusong to meet with Gu Danchao, director of the bureau, to claim the body. They said that the deceased was not Wang Weiyuan, but Gao Liping, from Chongming, Jiangsu, 28 years old, who had been working in Shanghai as a used stamp dealer. His suicide was likely due to economic distress. As for the breakup in love, it was another issue. Gao borrowed a park pass with the name Wang Weiyuan a few days before his death. Upon reading the newspaper, they learned that a male body had been recovered from the sea at Wusongkou, with a park pass bearing the name Wang Weiyuan, and realized that Gao had committed suicide at Wusong. The deceased had an elderly mother living in Chongming, who was unable to come to Wusong, so they were responsible for claiming the body and sending it back to his hometown for burial. They presented proof and were allowed to take the body, which was re-coffined and sent back to his hometown by boat.</p>
<h3>Chen Yadao and Tang Lunpu Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Original Sentence Reversed After Appeal Chen Yadao and Tang Lunpu from Ningbo were previously accused by the police of conspiring with Wang Liding to smuggle arms. The Special District Local Court sentenced Wang to six months imprisonment and Chen and Tang to four months imprisonment each. Chen and Tang were dissatisfied and hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to file an appeal, claiming that they were falsely accused by Wang. The Higher Branch Court held a hearing, summoning witnesses for investigation. After the conclusion of lawyer Shen's arguments, as detailed in this newspaper, yesterday afternoon was the date for the verdict in the case. Judge Song and assessors Gao and Ye ascended the bench, briefly questioned the two appellants Chen and Tang, and then announced the verdict: The original sentence regarding Chen Yadao and Tang Lunpu was revoked. Chen Yadao and Tang Lunpu are not guilty.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Constable's Extortion</h3>
<p>The section chief of the First District Second Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau received a report that constables Gao Weixiao and detective Li Dingyuan (ie, Li Zizhen), and detective partner Zhang Jinhai, had gone to the residence of a woman surnamed Wang at No. 13 Fuchang Lane in Xiaodongmen and, under the pretext that the woman smoked opium, had extorted 350 yuan. The maid Lu Chen was present as a witness. The case involved police officers dereliction of duty and extortion, so they were all detained and presented to the Public Security Bureau, who instructed that they be sent to the Local Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Yao Jiakui Fled After Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Awaiting Arrest and Further Interrogation Yao Jiakui, an employee of the China Electric Company on Jiangxi Road, was sent by the company's manager, an American named Remu, to the Nanjing branch in October of last year to manage sales affairs. He was transferred back to Shanghai last month. An audit of the sales revenue revealed a discrepancy of US$3,124.93. Yao, feeling guilty, abandoned his job and fled, confirming the suspicion of embezzlement. Remu hired lawyer Mei Huaquan to file a lawsuit with the Special District Local Court. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the court hearing, but the defendant could not be arrested for confrontation. Judge Xiao ordered a postponement, awaiting the arrest of the defendant for further interrogation.</p>

<p>In recent years, there have been many people from Jiangbei, Jiangsu, Nantong, Haimen, Yangzhou, and Hexian traveling to Shanghai, but there is no organization to unite them, causing feelings to become estranged. Moreover, when fellow villagers encounter injustice, there is nowhere to seek redress. The children of laborers traveling to Shanghai have no way to go to school. Hearing this is disheartening. Wu Ziqian, principal of Shanghai Women's Middle School, Huang Keding, director of Minghui English Commercial School, and others, seeing that all provinces and counties have established organizations, while we Subei people have fallen behind, have initiated the organization of the Subei Society to unite feelings, study academics, and establish schools</p>
<p>The purpose is to cultivate the poor children of travelers to Shanghai and promote local autonomy in their hometowns. A preparatory office has been established at Shanghai Women's Middle School on Wenmiao Road, Ximen, Shanghai. All people from Subei traveling to Shanghai can register there and work together to make it a reality as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: The Yangtze River basin and northern China will have cloudy skies. Shanghai's weather will improve. After encountering a low-pressure system, the hurricane will continue to move across the East China Sea towards the north-northeast or northeast. Therefore, there will be showers and extremely bad weather between the coast here and Kyushu and Korea. Within the Taiwan Strait, the wind direction is uncertain, and there will be fog. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 73.4 degrees, and the lowest was 63.0 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 83.8 degrees, and the lowest was 61.2 degrees.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<p>My Views on Labor (Continued) by Huang Fu</p>
<p>A speech at the Labor University: Today, in societies across all countries, there is talk of so-called labor-capital disputes. Laborers' only accusation against capitalists is that they exert little effort but reap great rewards. They do not realize that if the effort were truly little, it would be okay for capitalists to participate in the work. If the harvest were truly great, it would be okay to levy heavy taxes to support public welfare undertakings. There is no need to resent them for little effort and great rewards. I also hope for little effort and great rewards: reduce working hours (little effort) and increase wages (great rewards). Unexpectedly, the laborers want to overthrow those who already have the same mentality. It is the most ludicrous thing under heaven. I fear that when the goal of little effort and great rewards is not achieved, the overthrow of others will have just been accomplished, and they will readily occupy the position of the overthrown. If such a cycle repeats, will humanity ever have a day of peace? If all of humanity were to achieve this goal, I dare to assert that the day labor is reduced will be the day the harvest is extinguished. The result will be mutual destruction. My saying this does not mean that legitimate rights should be abandoned. However, in each other's demands, the facts should be considered. The interests of the nation on a grand scale and the prosperity of the business on a small scale must be taken into account. I believe that in human society, there is only so-called division of labor and so-called cooperation; I do not advocate competition. However, the world still has individual entities called "independent nations," so the division of labor and cooperation in the entire human society are not yet sufficient to discuss. (There are also many cases of countries cooperating because they have shared interests, but that is not enough to represent the whole picture.) However, at the very least, citizens within the same entity should implement the reality of division of labor and cooperation. If the individual is not healthy, there will definitely be no surplus to extend to others. Do not mistakenly believe in enticing words from the outside. Once the individual weakens and the limbs become powerless, the nutrients absorbed by the digestive organs within others' bodies cannot be distributed to strengthen one's own limbs. This is a very obvious fact, understandable even to a child of three feet. Therefore, I have often said that in today's world, there is no territory on the round sphere that is not under the jurisdiction of a country, and there is no citizen without nationality. Citizens are identified with the word "nation," so it can be known that the relationship between citizen and nation cannot be separated for even a moment. Since citizens are divided into four categories (note that these are not four classes), namely scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants, then scholars must be scholars of the nation, farmers must be farmers of the nation, and artisans must be artisans of the nation, and merchants must be merchants of the nation, in order to solidify the same entity. If one only knows how to chant poetry and admire the moon or hold a counting stick and calculate, then they can be called scholars and merchants, but they cannot be called national scholars and national merchants. In other words, they can be called citizens (citizens without a country are also citizens), but they cannot be called nationals. From what has been said earlier, the interpretation of the two words "labor" can lead to a conclusion: that our bodies, since they are attached to two entities for survival, cannot but obey the will of the two entities: (1) as a living being attached to the universe, the universe is constantly changing, and we should labor in accordance with this principle; (2) as a citizen attached to the nation, the nation hopes for division of labor and cooperation, moving towards progress in an orderly manner, and we should labor in accordance with this hope. As for the manner of labor, whether mental or physical, continuous or intermittent, it does not matter, as long as everyone is able to do their job and fulfill their duty.</p>
<p>Since the interpretation of the two words "labor" has already reached a conclusion, then our speech today can be considered complete. However, I would still like to offer a little suggestion to the students. In our speech today, we have quoted many sayings from Confucius, Mencius, and Guanzi. You may be tired of hearing them and find them uninteresting, thinking they are old clichés. You may not know that while the universe is constantly changing and is impermanent, if you take a glimpse at the traces of its changes, you will see that the order of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and the division of day and night, are the same every year and unchanging throughout the ages. This is extremely constant, the so-called "eternal principle of Heaven." Since the changes in the universe have constant rules, then there can be nothing new or strange in the world. For example, after the European War, Europeans strongly advocated two phrases: "Labor is sacred" and "Simple living." At one time, due to unclear translations, people regarded these as recently advocated terms in the world, considering them to be worthy of exploration. In fact, "labor is sacred" means diligence, and "simple living" means frugality. The names are different, but the substance is the same; they do not contain any special explanations or new meanings. Whether in ancient times or modern times, whether in China or abroad, the achievements of all national or individual undertakings, and the affluence of the national or individual economy, are all crystallizations of the diligence, frugality, and spiritedness of the people. In ancient times in our country, students had to personally perform sweeping and cleaning, and women had to personally operate wells. The sages of past generations also personally engaged in farming and practiced hunting to encourage diligence. They lived sparingly in food and drink and kept palaces simple to demonstrate frugality. All these things were to train and guide our people. They had a long history and a profound meaning. In modern times, Western material civilization came to the East, coinciding with a time when ancient teachings were gradually relaxed and new virtues had not yet been cultivated. As a result, the path of luxury and pleasure flowed into various cities without restraint, and people did not know where it would lead. They do not know that the true Western civilization is definitely not in dazzling ballrooms and glittering ornaments, but in the true spirit of diligence, frugality, and hard work possessed by the majority of their people. This is something that must be known. Human weaknesses may include a tendency to pursue novelty, but it is necessary to rely on those in society who possess innate goodness and foresight to guide them well. If one only seeks temporary convenience and caters to people's minds by using human weaknesses and advocating novel theories, it will not only mislead young people and society but will also inevitably lead to self-destruction. There is a good saying: "It's easy to paint ghosts and lizards, but difficult to paint dogs." This is because dogs are common objects, what is considered normal and constant. If the legs are too short or the tail is too long, everyone can criticize it. Ghosts are invisible objects, what is considered new and strange. One can freely invent three heads and six arms, and no one can prove it. There are quite a few painters in society today who are not very skilled and "cannot paint dogs, so they specialize in painting ghosts." You should be "cautious of seeing ghosts," because, according to old Chinese superstitions, "seeing ghosts is definitely not a good thing." It is still better to focus on loyalty, trustworthiness, sincerity, respect, diligence, and frugality, old clichés that can truly benefit you throughout your lives and can promote the prosperity and peace of the nation or the world. In particular, your time at school is truly the biggest turning point in your life, where success or failure is determined. You have come to Shanghai to study, leaving your fathers and brothers behind, and you are surrounded by many temptations. The only thing you can trust is the school. You should be extra cautious, and in addition to following school rules, focusing on your studies, avoiding outside affairs, and carefully selecting teachers and friends, you should also pay attention to practical experience. If those who study agriculture are unwilling to fertilize, and those who study engineering are unwilling to hold an axe, then the tens of thousands of graduates from all over the country each year, although they have specialized knowledge, lack specialized skills. The actual needs of society are probably not like that. After the European War, all countries advocated practical education because the purpose of learning is originally to be useful. In terms of military affairs, military leaders in all countries now undergo one year or half a year of soldier life. In terms of industry, engineers and technicians in all countries now undergo a certain period of worker life. This is something that can be emulated. I am naturally clumsy and straightforward, and I am willing to tell people the truth. I would rather people scold me than mislead them. Please forgive me. (The End)</p>

<h3>Finals Photos</h3>
<p>(1) Tang Silei Reigns Supreme in Sprinting Taking First Place in 100m, 200m, and 400m Chinese Athletes Zhong Lianji, Zhou Ende, and He Debao Also Achieved Good Results The American Tang Silei is a Genius in Sprinting with a Healthy and Strong Physique, Full of Energy, Good Starting Technique, and Fast Sprinting. With these four strengths, it is no wonder he took first place in the 100m, 200m, and 400m events, causing our Chinese athletes Zhong Lianji, Zhou Ende, He Debao, and Tuo Mo Siji to pale in comparison. His performance in the three events was particularly good in the 400 meters, achieving a time of 52.5 seconds, tying the Chinese record created by Liu Changchun, which is also commendable.</p>
<p>In the sound of the 100-meter gun, thousands of eyes were focused on Tang Silei. He went straight to the finish line with one breath, achieving a time of 11.2 seconds. Tuo Mo Siji, who had aimed to defeat Tang, was one step behind, ranking second. After the race, they shook hands to congratulate each other and willingly submitted. The Chinese athletes Zhong Yunji and Lin Guangxing were on the same level as the top two in the first 50 meters, but the difference in the last 30 meters led to Zhong ranking third and Lin ranking fourth. Chen Guojun ranked fifth, and Jiang Peng ranked sixth.</p>
<p>In the 200 meters, Zhou Ende and Lin Guangxing had ambitions for this event and put all their efforts into competing with Tang. They followed closely every step of the way. Tang, feeling the pressure, knew that he would not succeed without fighting. A change occurred halfway through, and Tang's bold strides were like flying on the wind, ahead of Zhou, breaking through the white line. Lin was one step behind Zhou, and fourth place went to Bai Nate, and fifth place went to Bo Lai Niao. The result was 23.1 seconds. In the 400 meters, Tang's left leg was stepped on shortly after the start, so he did not make any amazing moves at first. Zeng Rongzhong took advantage of the situation and led the group for as long as 80 meters. At 100 meters, He Debao rose to challenge. At that time, Tang was still hidden in the third or fourth place, which was shocking. Advancing to 300 meters, Tang slightly raised his head. After another 50 meters, Tang chased out from the crowd. The last four were all Chinese, like stars holding up the moon. With the white line in sight, Tang's legs were agile and arrived in the blink of an eye, achieving a time of 52.5 seconds, tying the Chinese record. After the race, Tang's injury caused issues, which were resolved after a long time. In general, everything has a cause, but there was no real evidence.</p>
<p>(2) Qiu Lingru Comes From Behind Breaking the East China Record in the 800 Meters With a Time of 2 Minutes 7.5 Seconds Americans Disappointed In the 800 meters, we expected a fierce battle between China and the United States, and it was said that the American Sugleton would overwhelm the competition. However, in fact, China took the lead. Qiu Lingru's result of 2 minutes and 7.5 seconds, creating a new East China record, added a lot of color to the conference. Qiu came from behind in the last 50 meters. At first, he was behind Li Shaoshang and was not very active. If Li Shaoshang maintained his endurance, he could have competed with Qiu for the championship. Sugleton ranked fourth, being overtaken by Ha Litai. Remidi, who had won the 10,000 meters, also finished fifth. His leg strength was amazing.</p>
<p>First Place: American Team 1 Minute 36 Seconds Hai Ermalilio Bai Nate Tang Silei</p>
<p>Second Place: Chinese Team Hao Chunde Lin Kexing Zhou Ende Zhong Lianji Third Place: Japanese Team</p>
<p>Four countries participated in this relay race: China, the United States, England, and Japan. As a result, the United States was first, China was second, England was third, and Japan was fourth. China's loss was not due to a lack of strength, but to a lack of skill in passing the baton. Every time during the three baton passes, they were always two steps behind, otherwise they could have taken the lead.</p>
<h3>Chinese National Championship Team (Wang Kai Photo)</h3>
<p>In the first leg, America led, China second, Britain third, Japan fourth, and then America and China arrived at the same time. At the beginning of the second leg, China was slightly ahead, but was then overtaken. Before long, China was first again, America second, Britain third, and Japan fourth. In the fourth leg, the Chinese got a good start and took the lead, and China chased very hard, but ultimately could not succeed. Third place went to Britain, and fourth to Japan. The time was 3 minutes, 41 and 2/5 seconds, equaling the Chinese record.</p>
<p>First place: American team, 3 minutes, 41 and 2/5 seconds: Hale, Bretlee, Trotter, Singleton.</p>
<p>Second place: Chinese team: Su Zuqing, He Debao, Wang Jianwu, Zeng Rongzhong.</p>
<p>Third place: British team: Xu Shi, Mill, Shen Feisai, Xie Po.</p>
<p>Fourth place: Japanese team</p>
<p>(3) Remedi's Heroic Performance in the 10,000 Meters</p>
<p>China's Ma Fengrui finishes second. Of the twelve starters, six finished. The results were ordinary.</p>
<p>Twelve great generals raced over 25 laps to compete in the 10,000 meters. As one's strength waned, another's grew; the front and back positions changed constantly, making it doubly interesting compared to other events. Ma Fengrui selflessly took the lead. After 100 meters, the group split into two, with Ma, Shuang Chen, and the French runner Cretot, etc. in the front group.</p>
<p>Remedi and Hutson, etc. were in the rear group. In the second lap, Cretot took the lead, followed by Ma Fengrui, Chen Xuzhou, Long Zexian, and some British runners. From the third lap, Ma took the lead again, with Xuzhou second. In the third and fourth laps, Xuzhou also briefly tried to take the lead.</p>
<p>From the fifth to the sixth lap, the situation changed slightly, with Ma in first, Long in second, Xuzhou in third, and the Portuguese Remedi and Polley side-by-side in fourth, helping each other. The distances between them were all within 50 meters. Starting from the seventh lap, the situation changed again, with Ma still in the lead, the two Remedi's in second, Chen Xingpei also quickening his pace, following behind Xuzhou and Long. Hutson was fifth, Cretot sixth. After nine laps, Remedi loosened his stride and closely followed Ma. Four great thighs rose and fell in unison. This continued until after the twenty-second lap, when he suddenly overtook Ma. Unwilling to remain dormant, he surged ahead. The running speed gradually increased. By the twenty-fourth lap, Remedi was 30 meters ahead of Ma. In the end, his spirit was even greater. A burst of courage (Above) Pole Vault: First Cao Yu (Center) (Below) Second Li Lin (Center)</p>
<p>(Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<p>came from who-knows-where. Two swift legs rose and fell quickly, breaking through the white line and winning the championship. Ma finished second, 50 meters behind. Chen Xingpei finished third. Thanks to his efforts in the last two laps, the veteran Chen Xuzhou still displayed his might, finishing the race in fourth place. The Englishman Polley was fifth. Long Zexian withdrew due to abdominal pain after completing fourteen laps. The American Hutson, whose performance was originally good, also dropped out due to exhaustion at the twentieth lap. The Frenchman Cretot, who once led, finally finished in sixth place. Of the twelve starters, only six finished. The hardship and difficulty they endured can be imagined.</p>
<p>(4) Chinese Dominance in Hurdles</p>
<p>Tao Yingjie creates a new national record in the intermediate hurdles. The top four in the high hurdles are all Chinese. Cao Yu, who had always led in the high hurdles, suddenly tripped in the final stride and broke the white line with his chest, resulting in Chen Guojun finishing first. The competition was fierce and the results were excellent. Chen's time of 17 seconds was his personal best. Cao was second, a case of coming so close. Tan Xixi carelessly knocked over the third hurdle, after which he could not help but be alarmed. As a result, his performance suffered and he fell to fourth. Li Wenchu was able to do as I had hoped, finishing in third place. The statement that the top spots were all Chinese has become a reality. Shi Huangkeli was unable to do his best and was greatly disappointed. Of the five starters, he finished fifth, and his results can be imagined.</p>
<p>In the intermediate hurdles, Tao Yingjie's time of 60 seconds was the only stunning record of the competition. When the announcer loudly proclaimed it, the male and female spectators cheered together. Wherever Tao went, applause followed. The psychology of admiring a hero is the same for everyone, regardless of nationality. In the race of five, China and America stood out. Chen Baoqiu, a leader in this field, finished third.</p>
<p>This was because he knocked over a hurdle, which reduced his speed later on, as he was afraid of committing a foul and being disqualified, which would be detrimental to the overall situation. The American Kai Huofer had a good position, and had once been in the lead, but he gradually slowed down due to insufficient endurance, but he took advantage of Chen's mistake and took second place.</p>
<p>(5) American Power in the Relay Race</p>
<p>1600 meters equals the Chinese record. The Chinese team failed due to a mistake in the baton exchange. The strength was equal. In the 800-meter relay race, it was either China or America. In the 800-meter event, the talents of China and America are equal, and the champion is even more difficult to predict. The Japanese also participated, otherwise it would have seemed monotonous. Unfortunately, America had the inside lane and China the outside lane, resulting in a great invisible loss. In the first leg, the Americans Hale and Hao Chunde competed desperately. Unexpectedly, the Japanese made a surprise attack and took second place. Hale was first, Hao third. The situation changed dramatically in the second leg, with Lin Guangxing taking the lead in one go. The American Mario was second, one meter behind. In the third leg, Zhou Ende's baton exchange was excellent, gaining a lot of momentum. The American White tried hard, but ultimately remained behind Zhou. In the final leg, Zhong Lianji led by five meters, striding forward. The American general Tang Silei was indeed outstanding. In the last 30 meters, he gradually caught up, breaking the line by one meter. The time was one minute and thirty-six seconds. China was second, Japan third.</p>
<p>(6) The Javelin is a Japanese Specialty</p>
<p>Japan's Furukawa throws the javelin 45.10 meters yesterday to win the championship. This was unexpected, and everyone was surprised. In fact, the javelin is a Japanese specialty. In the Far Eastern Games, the Japanese all threw over 60 meters. Yesterday, Furukawa's javelin head was not accurate. If it had flown straight instead of at an angle, it would have definitely been over 50 meters. During the competition, the Japanese flag was in the spotlight. The complete results of the five people are as follows:</p>
<p>First place: Furukawa (Japan) 45.10 meters</p>
<p>Second place: Wang Jihuai (China) 44.27 meters</p>
<p>Third place: Hutson (America) 43.67 meters</p>
<p>Fourth place: Wen Dingxin (China) 43.57 meters</p>
<p>Fifth place: Liu Jiajun (China) 41.77 meters</p>
<p>(7 Chen Baoqiu Succeeds in the Shot Put)</p>
<p>Chen Baoqiu failed in the discus the day before. Sure enough, he was determined to make amends in the shot put. The American De Luola was formidable, first inserting the American flag with 10.95 meters. Chen Baoqiu chased him with 11.055 meters in his second throw, and the audience applauded. Who knew that De Luola suddenly caught up with 11.28 meters in his fifth attempt, and the American flag went ahead again. Undeterred, Baoqiu threw 11.48 meters in his last attempt to win the championship, and only then did he finally lift his head and exhale.</p>
<p>First place: Chen Baoqiu (China) 11.48 meters</p>
<p>Second place: De Luola (America) 11.38 meters</p>
<p>Third place: Cao Yu (China) 10.76 meters</p>
<p>Fourth place: Lang (America) 10.49 meters</p>
<p>Fifth place: Ming (China) 10.27 meters</p>
<p>(8) Wang Jihuai Shines in the Triple Jump</p>
<p>The triple jump was almost like the long jump the day before. The five highest jumpers were all Chinese, and the flag raised was all the Blue Sky with a White Sun. Suddenly, the American Rinat jumped 12.54 meters, and the top of the flagpole became the Stars and Stripes. Fortunately, Wang Jihuai excelled, jumping 12.90 meters on his last, sixth jump, overturning the previous result. The results of the five people are listed below:</p>
<p>First place: Wang Jihuai (China) 12.90 meters</p>
<p>Second place: White Nate (America) 12.65 meters</p>
<p>Third place: Fan Jiaju (China) 12.37 meters</p>
<p>Fourth place: Liang Tiancheng (China) 12.32 meters</p>
<p>Fifth place: Hao Chunde (China) 12.11 meters</p>
<p>(9) Pole Vaulting: Difficult to Separate</p>
<p>In the pole vault, the American Hua Weike failed at 2.89 meters and was ranked fifth. Japan's Chiba failed at 3.03 meters and was also ranked fourth. White Nate was ranked third at 3.20 meters. Therefore, Li Lin and Cao Yu competed for first place. Everyone jumped over 3.34 meters, but they could not go any higher. Therefore, they went back and raised the bar again. After several attempts, Li Lin failed, and Cao Yu finally won first place. It was extremely difficult to separate them.</p>
<h3>Women's Performance</h3>
<p>Chinese Women Retreat Three Times</p>
<p>Americans and British Split Equally</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results Were Even Better</p>
<p>General Thomson, the Flying Woman If anyone deserves to be called a "flying woman", it is Miss Thomson of Britain from yesterday. 50 meters in 7 seconds, 100 meters in 13.2 seconds. Chinese girls are at least five meters behind. Wu Meixian and Sun Guiyun</p>
<p>are probably not her match. White Nate is more than a meter behind her. It is truly admirable.</p>
<p>White Nate Crowned Queen of Women's Jumps American Miss White Nate's two jumps, in both high jump and long jump, are unimaginable for Chinese girls. She runs with vigor and jumps high. Long jump: 4.59 meters. High jump: 1.38 meters. Watching her, one should truly strive harder.</p>
<p>(1) 800 Meters: First Qiu Lingru (China) (2) Javelin: First Furukawa (Japan) (3) Triple Jump: First Wang Jizhun (China) (4) 10,000 Meters: First Remedi (Portugal) (5) Shot Put: First Chen Baoqiu (China) (6) High Hurdles: First Chen Guojun (China) (Photos by this newspaper)</p>

<h3>A Wonderful Story of a Shandong Heroine</h3>
<p>Zhang Suhui's Fame in the Hurdles Shakes the World</p>
<p>Her Fiance, Yan Shouzhong, Gives a Lengthy Speech Opposing Sports and Promoting Natural Science. A quick dispatch from Jinan reports: Ms. Zhang Suhui, the number one female middle school student in Shandong, has made rapid progress in her sports achievements. She caused a sensation at the North China Games, overwhelming the female athletes from Harbin and winning the championship in the women's 80-meter low hurdles, greatly increasing her reputation. She has already become the focus of social attention. This reporter recently learned of a most interesting piece of news, which is worth recording, concerning Ms. Zhang Suhui's fiancé. Zhang Suhui, who goes by the name Zhi Min, is fifteen years old and from Lizin, Shandong. Her fiancé, named Shouzhong, is fourteen years old, also from Lizin. He and Zhang Suhui are cousins. He is intelligent and eloquent, truly a promising young man. He is currently studying at Jinan Private Zheng Middle School in Class 58, a first-year class. Their marriage was arranged by their parents when they were infants, what is called a "baby marriage". However, with his talent and her ability, they are evenly matched, and it can be said that they are a perfect match, worthy of being passed down as a beautiful story. They are like a pair of mandarin ducks who do not envy the immortals. However, after Ms. Zhang Suhui's fame increased, her classmates often made fun of her, causing her great distress and even causing her to cry. It is said that Yan Shouzhong gave a speech at a school conference yesterday, saying that the current promotion of sports expansion is costing a great deal of money, and that many students are focusing on sports and neglecting other schoolwork. It would be better to use the funds for promoting sports to focus on natural science and enrich the equipment of the science departments in various schools, which would be more beneficial to the students. This seems to have some merit as well.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Persuades the President of Tsinghua University to Stay</h3>
<p>Wu Nanxuan, President of Tsinghua University, submitted his resignation due to the turmoil at the university, outlining the events. The Ministry of Education issued an order yesterday stating that it had received the report. The Ministry noted that the President has excellent academic qualifications, sincerity, and integrity. Since taking office, he has been loyal, diligent, and outstanding in managing the school. Recently, due to the Ministry's instructions to revise the university's regulations, a misunderstanding suddenly arose among the professors, and the students engaged in excessive behavior, resulting in a regrettable phenomenon in the education community. The Ministry, after reviewing the circumstances, found that the President was not at fault in his duties. The Ministry has dispatched Jiang Menglin, President of Peking University, to the university to convey the Ministry's intentions, hoping that the professors would quickly seek redress. As for the students who insulted their teachers and made outrageous statements, the President should investigate the ringleaders and punish them according to the regulations. The President is loyal to the Party and the country, and is conscientious in his work. The Ministry relies heavily on him. Moreover, after this turmoil, the school affairs need to be reorganized. He should continue to actively take responsibility in accordance with the repeated telegrams and orders, and not entertain the idea of resigning. His request to resign should not be considered. This order.</p>
<h3>Provincial Schools After the Resignation of the Director of the Zhejiang Education Department</h3>
<p>Zhang Daofan is still requested to be responsible for raising funds. The educational funds in Zhejiang Province have been in arrears for four months. The teachers and staff of the provincial schools, unable to maintain their livelihoods, have decided to demand their salaries. Zhang Daofan, Director of the Education Department, also finding it difficult to raise funds, issued a notice of resignation on the 2nd and left Hangzhou that evening, expressing his determination. The schools, with no one responsible for educational administration, and accepting the notice from the Standing Committee of the Provincial Middle School Teachers and Staff Association, temporarily postponed the strike scheduled for the 6th. However, because Director Zhang's resignation was firm, and the education in the province could not be without a person in charge, they sent telegrams to the Ministry of Education and the Provincial Government, requesting that the National Government quickly appoint a worthy successor. At the same time, the schools also presented a request that Director Zhang remain responsible, as requested by the National Government, to expedite the payment of educational funds.</p>
<h3>Guangxi University May Be Restored Next Semester</h3>
<p>Guangxi University, since its establishment in 1928, has achieved remarkable results. It was suspended in 1929 due to personnel issues, which saddened many people. Recently, the Guangxi authorities have telegraphed the President Ma Junwu and Vice President Pan Zhuqi to return to Wuzhou to plan the restoration of the university. Chen Zhuzun, a former preparatory committee member, sent a telegram of congratulations yesterday, saying: "I recently heard that the Provincial Authorities have telegraphed the two gentlemen to return to Wuzhou to preside over the restoration of the university. From now on, the sound of reading will be revived, and I know that talents will emerge and scholars will gather, witnessing the prosperity of academics. I am overjoyed and send this telegram to congratulate you." It is said that the school will definitely be able to open next semester. I think the students in Guangxi who have been out of school will be very happy to hear this.</p>
<h3>The Education Community in Beijing and Shanghai Celebrates Teachers' Day</h3>

Tai Shuangqiu presided over the meeting, followed by the usual ceremonies. The chairman reported on the significance of establishing the festival, which was to improve the treatment of teachers, eliminate obstacles to teachers' status, and enhance professional cultivation. He also said that teachers should organize a national body and carry out practical movements, on the one hand, to urge the government to pay attention and to awaken society, and on the other hand, to strive for self-help. Each person should pay a certain amount of money each year as a public reserve fund for illness, death, and unemployment insurance to implement economic cooperation, starting with Teachers' Day, etc. Then, Fan Qi spoke, hoping that teachers would organize groups to seek a real guarantee for their lives and to reform national education and guide the masses. Jiang Jingtao gave a speech, saying that Teachers' Day is a manifestation of the spiritual community after the revolution, and he hopes that it will be held annually. Peng Baichuan said that the poor treatment of teachers has greatly affected the development of the world. Chinese people have always respected teachers, so we should create a Teachers' Day to advocate for the world, etc. Xu Keshi, a professor at Central University, raised three points on the life and responsibilities of teachers: to fight against the chaotic insects in the world, to guide the young people with knowledge, and to strive to become teachers of the future world. Then, Zhou Yingjie, a representative from Fujian, gave a detailed account of the hardships of primary school teachers' lives. Later, Cheng Qibao and others proposed to request the Ministry of Education to forward a request to the National Government to officially designate June 6 as Teachers' Day, to organize a national teachers' union, and to send a telegram to promote Teachers' Day to countries around the world, etc. All of these proposals were passed.

<h3>Remembering Mr. Feng Junmu</h3>
<p>— Zhen Yi</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Junmu of Cixi. His literary fame filled the world. He suddenly passed away on May 18 due to a brain illness. Causing grief across the country. His family has already set June the sixth as the day to establish a memorial for Mr. Feng in his hometown of Cixi. Former students of the Shanghai gang. Plan to borrow the Ningbo Shanghai Association of Fellow Townsmen to hold a memorial service. To express their sorrow. From now on, the literary circles of Shanghai. Have lost another member.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng started from the extreme of the humble. At first he only felt numbness in his fingers. Which then extended to his whole body. Before long he became mute. From the onset of illness to his passing. It was only one hundred and twenty days. Before he fell ill. The famous doctor Fan Wenfu of Yong came to Shanghai to visit Mr. Feng. After returning. He sent a letter to a friend saying. "Mu Gong is critically ill." His friend was greatly surprised. And immediately came to Shanghai to visit Mr. Feng. Seeing Mr. Feng eating normally. He laughed at Mr. Fan's misjudgment. After Mr. Feng passed away. People began to sigh at Mr. Fan's foresight. Therefore, Mr. Fan's eulogy for Mr. Feng contained the words "Believing in quack doctors is often a hidden cause of death. Wishing to die, you die." In fact, Mr. Feng himself knew that he would not recover during his illness. Last year, there was a rumor in Sheng Province that Mr. Feng had died. Mr. Feng wrote a eulogy, saying, "A chronic illness entangles, with no joy in life. If allowed to follow you into the earth, even if I were to hold the whip, I would be delighted and admire it." At that time, Mr. Feng was ill. After being massaged by the famous doctor Yuan Zhengdao. He had almost recovered. This eulogy was written by his student Wei Youfei because he could not hold a pen due to his illness. After it was sent. Mr. Feng suddenly felt that the eulogy was too bleak. And planned to change it, but he did not succeed. Unexpectedly, it became a prophecy.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Feng came to Shanghai. He had a lot of literary exchanges. Which he found very painful. After he fell ill, his right wrist was affected by the wind. But his left wrist was still able to write reverse characters. He once wrote an encomium for the portrait of Mr. Wang Geyi's ancestor. That was his last writing.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng treated people kindly. And did not remember people's faults. One of his students cheated Mr. Feng out of his fee. And even slandered Mr. Feng in return. Many people were upset. Mr. Feng was not angry at first. But said. "That person must have been forced by money. And had no choice but to do so." He did not care about it at all. Now that Mr. Feng has passed away. We are grateful for his old virtues. And we cannot help but feel our tears flowing down our cheeks.</p>
<p>There are many poems and couplets across the country mourning Mr. Feng. His student Hong Jingshan has a five-ancient poem. The language is extremely poignant, and it is transcribed as follows. Seeking emptiness in vain, the mind and soul are always in turmoil. Renting a hall to gather guests, laughing and lifting eyebrows. If the writing can comfort the spirits, the stage is held naturally. The talent received is not sufficient, and the shame is like unbearable clothing. The heart is quite calm, and the wonderful arguments involve cunning words. The creation is diverse, and the light is strange and the dragon is captured. The visitors enjoy the mornings and evenings, and the teacher also forgets fatigue. Wanting to return, but unable to return, being tied by illness. A family's dreams of seagulls, the country is full of peace. Since winter, he has suffered from a terminal illness, and the numbness has become increasingly weak. It was not a disease of the heart, but only heard of groans and sorrows. The teacher had a lonely intention, and arrogantly displayed his posture. He was a child who followed the example of writing, and met the ancients. He carried his liver and gallbladder, and his writing was lewd and thoughtful. His fame spread across the north and south, and his voice was strange. After reading the mulberry sea, he lectured in the spring of the Yangtze River. I am ashamed of the teacher's door, and I have failed to protect what I know. The teacher's nature is kind and virtuous, and he can relieve ridicule and wake up the liver and spleen. He loves me like nature, and he does not deceive me. This talent should be greatly used, and both goodness and knowledge are needed. What is there to worry about? Heaven has already made his poems prosperous. Using trivialities to consume his strange energy, worries and sorrows also follow. Suddenly I heard of the county's illness, and the tears were like broken pearls. The killer is cruel to the dog, why did it reach my teacher? The people of Chu have lost their essence, and what is Hui Zi doing again? Resolved again and again, to whom do I address my questions? (Did not accept rewards)</p>
<h3>A Record of the Shaoxing Infant Health Competition</h3>
<p>— Gao Tianqi</p>
<p>The Shaoxing County People's Education Center held an infant health competition on May 23rd and 31st. 212 people registered. 150 people participated. This was the first time that Shaoxing held an infant health competition. Therefore, it is recorded here to be true to the nature of "Free Talk."</p>
<p>Divided into Stages The participating infants were divided into twelve stages. Starting from about six full months of age. To about six full years of age. With each half year counted as one stage. Most of the participating infants were in the stages below four years old. There were only four people who were six full years old.</p>
<p>Selected Infants In the preliminary competition, three people were selected from each stage. For a total of thirty-six people. In the semi-final, the overall first, overall second, and overall third places were selected from the thirty-six people. The results were that the overall first place went to Gao Shumei. Second place went to Tang Jianxing. Third place went to Wang Xiji. The first and second places were both female. The third place was male. It has been found that in infant competitions across the country. The winners are often female. Which is a sign of the development of women's rights.</p>
<p>Laughter and Crying During the weighing and measuring of height. Younger infants. Were often crying because they were afraid of strangers. While older infants. Were running around, jumping and laughing all over the place. Laughter and crying occurred at the same time. It was very lively.</p>
<p>Doctors in a String The judges of the competition. Were doctors. One person for each stage. For a total of twelve people. Doctors from all hospitals. Were invited. But the number was still insufficient. Therefore, the military doctors of the security regiment. And the forensic doctors of the court. Were also recruited. During the judges' meeting. Someone said that this meeting could be said to be a gathering of all the doctors in Shaoxing. Everyone burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Returning Fully Loaded The overall first place went to Gao Shumei. Who is this reporter's eldest daughter. She is sixty-eight months old, weighs forty-seven pounds. And is three feet nine and a half inches tall. She was the champion of all the infants. In the preliminary competition. She ranked first in the eleventh stage. In the semi-final. She won the overall first place with 96.3 points. In addition to the gold and silver medals awarded by the association. The county magistrate gave a mirror stand. And she also received dozens of pieces of candy, toys, books, shoes, and socks. She returned fully loaded, and passers-by were envious.</p>
<h3>Talking About Japanese Customs</h3>
<p>Today, the awakening of nationalism and the development of culture in both China and Japan are obviously comparable and undeniable to the world. But who knows that Japan has adopted Chinese customs as their own, even calling itself a civilized universe, while China has fallen behind the nations? Is this a matter of luck or misfortune? Looking back, the Japanese were more fascinated by Chinese civilization than even the Americans are today, regarding everything Chinese as the only supreme treasure. During the mid-Tang Dynasty in China, Taoism flourished, Confucianism prospered, and Indian civilization also entered with Buddhism, greatly developing our nation's political and philosophical thought. At that time, Japanese emperors sent envoys to China to seek our rituals and customs. The upper class emulated the lower class, and everyone happily followed suit. Thus, Chinese customs spread throughout the three islands of Japan. To this day, the two nations share similar seasonal festivals and related superstitions, even after thousands of years. Here are some examples for the readers:</p>
<p>New Year Without Sprinkling Water: In Japan, from New Year's Day to the fifth day of the New Year, people wish each other happiness. Even fathers, sons, brothers, and sisters exchange greetings. Shops sweep the floor but do not sprinkle water, as water is considered wealth. Accumulating water means accumulating wealth. In China, the fifth day of the New Year is the day of the God of Wealth. On the night of the fourth day, incense and candles are burned to welcome the God of Wealth. After this, shops open their doors daily and resume business as usual. This is similar to Japan's "Ehomairi" and "Hatsu-ni," where "Ehomairi" is worshipping the Toshitokujin (deity of the year's good fortune), and "Hatsu-ni" is welcoming esteemed guests and presenting them with goods.</p>
<p>Peach Blossoms on the Third Day of the Third Month: On the third day of the third month, Chinese scholars perform a ritual called "Xiyi" and drink by the river. Japanese elegant people also have the custom of reciting seasonal poems. In my hometown, rural women call this day the birthday of shepherd's purse flowers. Inserting the flower is said to bring more gains and less poverty throughout the year. Japanese women simply replace shepherd's purse flowers with peach blossoms and go on outings with friends to the riverside or seaside, just like our customs. According to past practices near the Western Capital, people used to carry peach branches to ward off evil on this day, which is similar to our Zheng custom of holding orchids to summon souls and dispel misfortune.</p>
<p>Writing the Character "King" on the Dragon Boat Festival: Every Dragon Boat Festival in Japan, calamus and mugwort are hung on doors, said to prevent fire disasters. Women also wear calamus on their waists. It is said that boiling and drinking the calamus can cure all diseases, and drinking calamus wine at noon can detoxify the body. Other customs, such as writing the character "King" on boys' foreheads and carrying small tigers on their backs (made of cloth), are all similar to our customs. There are also "May dolls" of Kato Kiyomasa, which are similar to our Zhong Kui. The Dragon Boat Festival scene can be said to be very similar.</p>
<p>Mid-Autumn Festival Rice Dumplings: Every Mid-Autumn Festival, when the jade rabbit rises, the Japanese also have the custom of burning incense and worshiping the moon. Young children dance and sit in the courtyard, singing folk songs or eating melons and fruits. In China, we have mooncakes to represent the scenery of that time. Japan also has round foods such as boiled dumplings and dried sweet potatoes for moon viewing, commonly known as "Tsukimi dango."</p>
<p>Double Ninth Festival Chrysanthemum Viewing: The Japanese are famous worldwide for their love of flowers and plants. On the Double Ninth Festival, each town gathers famous chrysanthemums in one place, in yellow, white, purple, or red, for the appreciation of poets, just like the chrysanthemum exhibition in Shanghai's Little Garden and Great World.</p>
<h3>Around the Yellow Sea (25)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>Given this environment, what should we Chinese do? People are scheming with all their might, with the entire nation united against us – not just Japan, but other countries as well. How can we break through this encirclement and fight our way out? And looking internally, things are also in this state.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about what we *should* do yet. Let's first talk about what we *shouldn't* do. We must first defeat three kinds of mentality.</p>
<p>First, the mentality of panic. Second, the mentality of passivity. Third, the mentality of fatalism.</p>
<p>If we still believe that our land is very fertile, our resources are very abundant, and the foundation laid down to this day is still very good, that the problem lies with the people, and that the people's reproduction is very flourishing, and their qualities are very intelligent and outstanding, and that these are only acquired and not inherent, then China is definitely a salvageable nation. What is there to panic about? Why be passive? There is always a type of young person who, upon hearing others talk about how dangerous the situation is and seeing the phenomena in China, becomes more and more afraid and more and more angry. When fear and anger reach their extreme, they end up taking the path of suicide. I want to tell them that China will not perish. However, this kind of mentality of yours is the mentality of a nation about to perish. I also want to tell you, do you really want to die? If you are truly not afraid of death, then expand this fearlessness, and that will be enough to prevent China from perishing. It just depends on how you die.</p>
<p>What is most unacceptable is fatalism. It's bad enough if the uneducated are fatalistic, but even some educated people say, "I think there will be a way after the country is lost." What kind of talk is this? In 1919, influenced by the new tide of national self-determination, Korea's national independence movement resulted in the deaths of more than 7,500 people, the injury of more than 15,900 people, and the arrest of more than 46,900 people in that year alone, from March to May. From October to November of that year, another 3,089 people died (please see page 13 of my humble work on Korea). It can be said that many people died for nothing. In the end, they still did not achieve independence. If everyone had been fearless before the fall of the country in 1910, I dare say that the country would not have been lost. Unfortunately, at that time, they were still making a ruckus over what party and what faction. Even after the fall of the country, they accepted titles in the new dynasty and were still making a ruckus over how many people were in a certain faction (please see pages 87 to 89 of my humble work on Korea).</p>

<h3>Random Lake Talks (4)</h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Therefore, the method of making water shield soup is to first rinse it with cold water, using a water bath method, to remove only the mud and sand, without removing its slippery fat. Place it in a bowl, cover and protect the bowl mouth with the palm of your hand, allowing the water to flow out through the gaps between your fingers, so that the water shield is clean without losing its true essence. Separately boil broth with shredded ham until it boils, then remove the shredded ham and do not use it. Only use the clear broth, and do not let it stop boiling. Quickly pour in the rinsed water shield, and the boiling will stop immediately. Remove it from the heat and it is ready to eat. It is fragrant, crisp, smooth, and tender, with a clear taste that invigorates the teeth and gums, incomparable to anything else. The "Yugeng Lu" says that it is roughly like fish marrow and crab fat, but much lighter and clearer, which is also not quite accurate. Only orchids among flowers and lychees among fruits can be compared to it. However, only people from Hangzhou can truly know its taste. Outsiders hear its name and say it is tasteless when they try it, just like Longjing pre-Qingming tea. Pre-Qingming tea leaves are tender green, fragrant, and sweet, truly a refined product, suitable for only one brewing. The brewing method also has a set procedure. Dried tea leaves must first be moistened before use. The so-called "moistening" is to place the tea leaves in a tin-shaped bottle and rinse them with cold water to remove dust and ash, and to moisten the leaves. Then, wait for boiling water to pour over it. The boiling of water also has a degree. The so-called "sound like a cart turning smoothly" is when the water first boils, no more than 70 degrees Celsius. In the blink of an eye, it reaches more than 80 degrees Celsius. It must reach the "fish eye" stage to reach 100 degrees Celsius. This is called "the spring water is cooked." All substances that can precipitate, such as dregs, will sink to the bottom of the pot. Then, use a bowl with a lid and a hairy rim, commonly called a "lidded bowl," to store the drained tea leaves. Immediately pour boiling water into it to nine-tenths full. Add the lid to make it airtight, so that a vacuum forms in the bowl. The lid will be tightly sealed and cannot be opened. If it is overfilled, the water will overflow from the hairy rim and will not be able to form a vacuum. The steam will escape and cool easily, and the color, fragrance, and taste cannot each come out, losing its true beauty. Therefore, when I picked new tea myself in previous years, I inscribed on the tin bottle, "Originally, fine tea is like a beautiful woman, its color and appearance are naturally true. Not to be allowed for the wild barbarian to casually drink. It must be known that its flavor surpasses lake water shield." It is truly noble like orchids among flowers and should not be discussed in the same breath as peonies.</p>
<p>West Lake does not produce much tea. It has long been known as Yunlong Shihhu, divided into four grades. Yun is produced in Wuyun Mountain, which is the highest ground. Buds can be picked as early as the spring equinox, called Mingqian. Long for Longjing. The soil is fertile, and the color, fragrance, and taste are even better. Picking one flag and one spear of tea before the rains is called Flag Spear, which is pleasing to the eye. Shi for Lion Peak. The mountain is rugged and rocky, so its leaf color is verdant but not as tender green and lovely as Longjing. Hu for Hupao. The terrain is low-lying, and the picking is the latest in the mountain stream. The quality is the lowest. Only the tea sold in the mountains is often in greater demand than supply, and the price per tael is often no more than one yuan, or as little as three or four jiao. How can it not be a treasure? The truly authentic Mingqian tea is only wild tea. Wild people pick it at dawn. If you are late, the quick-footed will get it first. Generally, those who cultivate tea often do not pick it early. They must wait for it to grow larger to increase its weight and earn more money.</p>

<h3>Commercial News: Last Week's Gold Prices Fell</h3>
<p>Uncertain news caused market fluctuations. Last week, the price of gold trended downwards again, breaking the 800 tael mark. However, the fluctuations were very severe, creating a swirling situation. There were daily twists and turns of more than ten taels, hovering around 800 taels. The trend was unpredictable, and ultimately the price fell a total of 15 taels. The highest price at the beginning of the week was 814 taels, and the lowest at the end of the week was 791 taels and 6 qian, a difference of 22 taels and 4 qian. Domestic and international news was mixed. The silver market and Shanghai exchange rates also trended downwards. The business was often blocked, and market trading was very different. In the end, many speculators sold off their long positions, and short positions increased. Now, the major firms such as Zifenyong, Hengxing, Bingxing, Chengfengyong, Xinxian, Daxingyong, Fuchang, and Yuanxiang are doing so. However, the Dalian gang and Tongtaichang and Yongfeng are all holding short positions. Initially, the settlement price was estimated at 40 or 50 taels, but later it was only about 30 taels, and then back to over 40 taels. The destination of spot goods was ordinary, and the bare price was about 9 taels on top of the scheduled price. Now, the details of this week's events are excerpted below:</p>
<p>In the end, the calculated decline was 15 taels. From Monday (June 1st), the big bar (gold bar) returned long 0.125, the silver price had no telegram, and it was almost ordered to suspend the quotation. The domestic market seemed loose. As for the July gold price, the opening price rose by 5 taels, calculated at 812 taels and a half, followed by 14 taels. Later, large households sold off, and the exchange rate also loosened, falling sharply by 10 taels, to only 803 taels and 5 qian. Afterwards, it recovered to a high of 6 or 7 taels, to 811 taels in the afternoon, and closed at 808 taels and 5 qian, an increase of 1 tael compared to the previous Saturday. The next day, the big bar went up again 0.0625, the silver price increased by 0.375, and the previous order also loosened by half a notch. The gold market opened at 806 taels and 2 qian, immediately falling by 2 taels and 3 qian. Then, because buyers seemed to be plentiful, and news of a fall in the New York stock market, people braced themselves, and it rose to 11 taels and a half. After this, the Guangdong gang sold off, and the previous order was also insufficient. At noon, it broke 800 taels, with the lowest estimate being only 792 taels and 8 qian, and closed at 95 taels and a half, already reversing the three-day rise, a calculated decrease of 13 taels and 5 qian. According to the previous and subsequent markets, there was a difference of 18 taels and 7 qian. On Wednesday, the big bar went up again 0.125, the US silver only increased 0.125, and the British gold, etc. increased by half a notch, but the gold market opened high instead, at 96 taels and a half, because the silver market, although rising, lacked volume. Afterwards, it was confusing and uncertain, but potentially weak, only estimated at 95 taels and 5 qian, then reached a high point, because of rumors that the cash stored in a certain bank would be shipped for export, which caused a surge. It closed at 806 taels and 4 qian, a rebound of 10 taels and 9 qian compared to the previous day. The next day, the big bar contracted by 0.0625 to 0.125, the silver market decreased slightly by 0.125, the previous order remained unchanged, but the gold market was the opposite of the previous day, opening slightly lower by 1 tael and 9 qian, to 804 taels and 5 qian, followed by 0.073 taels, because the selling pressure was strong, falling more than 10 taels, to 95 taels and 5 qian at noon. In the afternoon, it reopened, reaching over 4 taels and 5 qian, and closed at 0.03 taels, still falling by 3 taels and 4 qian. On Friday, the big bar remained unchanged, the exchange market was also unremarkable, and the gold price opened at 801 taels and 6 qian. Sellers were active, retreating to 798 taels. Later, buyers were diligent, rising to 804 taels and 8 qian. At noon, it retreated to 800 taels and 0.002 qian. In the afternoon, speculator Mr. Liu bought more than 1,400 bars, so it was stimulated to rise by 5 taels, to 805 taels and 8 qian, closing at 4 taels and 4 qian, an increase of 1 tael and 4 qian compared to the previous day. On Saturday, the silver market was very flat, while the exchange market was apparently flat but secretly declining. The gold price opened at 803 taels and 7 qian, followed by 4 taels and 8 qian. Because of rumors that the international silver price conference would have results, people's hearts were down, and it suddenly became weak. In an instant, it collapsed, and the momentum was overwhelming, breaking the 800 tael mark and plummeting more than 10 taels, to a sudden 791 taels and 6 qian at noon, with the consent of big households such as Mr. Lu selling off long positions, and other households following suit, so the previous order was also loose, until the noon close was 792 taels and a half, a sharp drop of 11 taels and 9 qian compared to the previous day, and there was a huge pullback of 13 taels and 2 qian in half a day. Now, the high and low prices of the British, American, and Indian silver markets, as well as the exchange and gold prices, are listed separately below:</p>
<p>Category, Highest, Lowest, Compared to Last Saturday, Big Bar, Near Term 12 pence 3.75, 12 pence 8.75, Up 0.125, Also Losing, Long Term 12 pence 3.75, 12 pence 1.875, Up 0.125, American Silver Price 26.5 cents, 26.375 cents, Up 0.375, Bombay City 42 rupees 0.09, 42 rupees 0.04, No Change, British Exchange Rate Quoted 1 shilling 2 pence 1, 1 shilling 1 pence 75, Up 0.255, American Exchange Rate Again 28.375 yuan, 27.875 yuan, Up 0.5 yuan, Japanese Exchange Rate Again 1 tael 7 qian 7 fen 25, 1 tael 7 qian 4 fen, Down 1 fen 2, Gold Price 814 taels, 791 taels 6 qian, Down 15 taels</p>

According to the big bar, the silver price increased by 0.0625 for both near and long term, both at 12 pence 2125. Also received a telegram from New York, stating that the American silver price also increased by 0.125, calculated at 26.5 cents for spot goods, and private telegrams also increased by 0.125.

<h3>Discount Market as Quiet as Before</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the financial community took the usual Sunday holiday. Only money shops were open as usual, but there were no counterpart transactions, so they were also idle. The market price of foreign currency in the market was 7 qian 2 fen 8 li, with 7 hao and a half at the morning market, and 7 qian 2 fen 8 bai 7 hao and a half at the afternoon market, resulting in a small change of 2 hao and a half compared to the previous noon. The silver discount for both the morning and afternoon markets was 3 fen, which was slightly better than the spot market of the previous morning. The amount of exchange drawings was 485,000 in the morning market and only 235,000 in the afternoon market. There were no banknotes in either market. The off-site banknotes were 120,000 in the morning market, and there were also no transactions in the afternoon market. Due to the holiday, there was no news from banks regarding transactions and collections. The collection of foreign public orders by money shops was over 4.2 million, and no foreign drawing heads were heard. The collection of silver public orders was over 32 million. The transactions of small money shops were over 300,000.

The copper coins had to increase by 2,000 cash, to 379,500 cash.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Bond Market Rotated</h3>
<p>Daily changes were uncertain... Transactions amounted to over 87 million. During the past week, the market conditions for various public bonds in the local securities market showed few spot transactions, totaling 125,900 yuan. The futures market for June was very active, with lively market entries and exits. The increase in the huge amount of margin did not slightly weaken. However, the July futures were unusually quiet in the market due to the restrictions on the exchange side that required delivery of actual goods for sales. Daily entries and exits were minimal, with each accounting for about 17 million in the first half of the week. The two days of Thursday and Friday were slightly flat, with each accounting for 11 million yuan. On the last day of the weekend, there were still over 14.7 million yuan, totaling 87.52 million yuan, a decrease of over 20 million yuan compared to the previous week. As for the trend of various bond prices, the market sentiment could not be unified due to the chaotic situation, and the demand and supply were uneven. The market price rose and fell suddenly, and the changes were frequent, so the market situation was very chaotic. On Monday, the market sentiment was good, and buying transactions were booming, with a strong rebound. The July futures of the 20-roll were stopped for auction due to excessive gains, and other gains were mostly around 2 yuan. On Tuesday, the upward trend was still strong, and the buying interest did not weaken slightly. Various bonds picked up several yuan again, but the trend of the 20-roll entire six series was slightly flat. On Wednesday, the buying interest weakened slightly, and the price turned weak, with various declines of 1 to 2 yuan. Thursday had both gains and losses, and the fluctuations were still slight. The weekend had one gain and one loss, and there were no major changes. As a result, compared to the previous week, there were both gains and losses, and the amount was mostly less than one yuan. However, spot goods, which were rarely traded, fell quite sharply. In the future, the bond market will still be lively after the stock exchange reduces margin restrictions. Now, the statistics of the high and low fluctuations of various bond prices are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>Bond Type, Period/Spot, Highest of the Week, Lowest of the Week, Difference, Gain/Loss, Whole Six Spot, 62.7015, 59.5063.0, Loss 3.20, Whole Six June, 60.6015, 58.7061.90, Loss 1.30, Customs Spot, 49.403, 49.0030.40, Loss 0.80, Customs June, 49.902, 47.0012.90, Gain 1.30, Reorganization Spot, 49.403, 47.2042.20, Loss 5.94, Reorganization Spot, 47.805, 47.5050.30, Loss 5.70, Reorganization June, 52.002, 47.1044.90, Gain 0.40, Reorganization July, 50.602, 46.4034.20, No Change, Demobilization Spot, 68.706, 67.0011.70, Loss 5.30, Demobilization June, 72.002, 66.7015.30, Gain 0.40, Demobilization July, 69.002, 64.0045.00, Gain 1.30, 19 Customs Spot, 65.102, 60.8044.30, Loss 6.38, 19 Customs Small, 61.503, 60.0041.50, Gain 1.00, 19 Customs June, 66.602, 61.0065.60, No Change, 19 Customs July, 64.502, 60.0034.00, Gain 0.20, 19 Goodness June, 65.602, 60.5065.10, Loss 0.10, 19 Goodness July, 65.402, 60.0063.40, Gain 1.00, 20 Roll Spot, 57.001, 56.0061.00, Loss 6.33, 20 Roll June, 60.502, 54.8065.70, Gain 0.25, 20 Roll July, 59.602, 54.2065.40, Gain 1.60, 20 Customs Spot, 59.502, 56.063.00, Loss 19.81, 20 Customs June, 59.502, 54.9564.55, Loss 1.00, 20 Customs July, 58.502, 54.9064.00, Loss 0.80, 96 June, 15.902, 14.4011.50, Gain 0.53, 69 July, 15.701, 14.8050.90, Gain 0.50, 7 Years Spot, 81.003, 81.003..., Loss 1.00, Continued Roll Spot, 31.202, 31.0010.20, Gain 1.81, Chinese Commercial Electricity Spot, 14.001, 14.1..., No Market</p>
<h3>Last Week's Yarn Market Was Very Mediocre</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was quite lively at the beginning of the week. Buyers from the North Road area were unusually enthusiastic. The Tianjin gang absorbed large quantities. Due to the tightening of exchange rates, northern yarn sales had been dominated by Japan. Now, with the gold price being firm, it was impossible to import. The price of local yarn was relatively cheap, so they purchased large quantities in Shanghai. Moreover, the fabric market there was improving, so they collected as much as possible. Local yarn accounted for the majority, and 16-count Chinese yarn was almost completely bought up, so some were out of stock. The market prices for 16-count and 20-count yarn were high and in short supply. Other gangs from Sichuan, Shantou, and Guangdong also felt active, and the market seemed to be flourishing. However, the bottom stock of 10-count coarse yarn was relatively thick, and the sales were too sluggish. A speculator also dumped a large batch of contract yarn, with a huge amount. Midway, the spot yarn sales slightly stabilized, but the selling pressure was still heavy. Most short sellers believed that the situation was still wavering, and the sales of coarse yarn were not strong, so the intention to sell was not abandoned when the market rose. At the weekend, it was heard that the gold price had fallen back, and the yarn market also fell by more than one or two taels. According to statistics, the total amount purchased by various gangs throughout the week was 14,600 bales, with 4,000 bales from fellow merchants and 200 bales from Japan. It is said that Shenxin factory goods were transported to Japan every day, but the amount was not huge. Because of the sluggish sales of coarse yarn, contract yarn sellers were hesitant and still dumped when the price rose, without any intention to cover. It is estimated that there are more than 20,000 bales of 10-count coarse yarn in the yarn and cloth warehouse. If these goods can be sold, there is hope for a price increase, otherwise, it will still be suppressed. It is heard that in recent years, Japanese factories have not spun much 10-count yarn and have mostly switched to spinning 20-count and above, which is more profitable. However, in general, although there is a lack of rising wind, it is difficult to fall sharply, because raw materials are expensive, the silver price is difficult to rise, and the gold market is ultimately difficult to soften. At the beginning of the week, the contract yarn price rose by 1 to 2 taels following the strong spot demand, but it fell sharply at the weekend. As a result, the near-month price fell by 8 or 9 qian compared to the previous week, while the far-month price was flat. The total transaction volume was 166,550 bales. The price of Osaka Sanpin yarn rose by 2.3 yuan compared to the previous week. Now, the purchase volume of each gang is recorded below:</p>
<p>Gang, Bale Amount, Gang, Bale Amount, Sichuan, 3,100, Inland, 1,720, Tianjin, 5,000, Shantou, 1,500, Wuhu, 170, Changsha, 120, North Gang, 670, Guangdong, 2,900, Qingdao, 200, Xiamen, 250, Fujian, 100, Qinhuangdao, 125, Yunnan, 180, Xuzhou, 100, Luzhou, 1,800, Ningbo, 135, Japan, 200, Miscellaneous Gang, 200, Zhenjiang, 150, Shandong, 150, Fellow Merchants, 4,000</p>
<h3>Last Week's Cotton Market Was Mixed</h3>
<p>The cotton market was unremarkable, with a rise and fall between 8 and 9 taels throughout the week. There was no clear direction, and the market had no confidence. Judging from the global situation, it should naturally trend downwards, but the tightening of exchange rates prevented foreign cotton from being imported in large quantities. Moreover, the domestic stockpiles were drying up, and the price in Hankou was several taels higher than in Shanghai, making it difficult to reconcile. Comparing the two, it was difficult to predict whether it would rise or fall. The future was even more unpredictable. Japanese merchants were actively purchasing contract cotton, and the amount of new cotton bales was accumulating more and more, about 40,000 to 50,000 dan. The price of each month fell by 1 to 2 qian compared to the previous week. The total transaction volume was 312,100 dan. The source was 1,230 bales of Yaohua cotton and 150 bales of Tonghua cotton. The price of American cotton fell by 20 to 30 pounds compared to the previous week. The spot shipments of various factories were more active than the previous week, but it slowed down again at the weekend. Now, the amount of spot cotton purchased by various factories is recorded below:</p>
<p>Factory, Highest Price, Lowest Price, Transaction Volume, Time Limit, Shaanxi Cotton, 40.10, 39.00, 2,245 pieces, Spot Delivery to Factory, Huoji Cotton, 38.75, 38.25, 1,200 bales, Also, Haitian Sharp, 39.25..., 100 bales, Also, Bailuo Gone, 41.75..., 1,000 pieces, August Delivery to Factory, Pingxiaer, 32.00..., 500 pieces, Spot, Also, Xingxiang Cotton, 40.15, 39.75, 3,000 pieces, Also, Stack Transportation Number In</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton, 39.75..., 200 pieces, Spot Stack</p>
<h3>The Weakness of Foreign Cotton Remains</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton's market situation was weak due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, good weather, and profit-taking by bulls. Futures fell 24 to 26 points, spot prices fell 25 points, British cotton futures fell 13 points, spot prices fell 10 points, Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 10 points, and Indian cotton was soft due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and profit-taking by bulls. Karachee, Oomra, and Broach all fell 5 rupees, according to a telegram. (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>Compared to the previous day, American cotton contracts for Shen regulations fell 24.39 at 7831. Compared to the previous day, British cotton contracts for Shen regulations fell 13.43 at 7453. 108662 fell 440.70 at 2440. 8457 fell 1343.50 at 1343. 128882 fell 441.80 at 2541. 14651 fell 1344.30 at 344. 19002 fell 442.30 at 2542. Current price is 44.60 at 46810. 3919 fell 43.20 at 243. Egyptian 7551 is 71.70 at 1071. 5937 fell 44.10 at 2644. Karachee 134 fell 5.29 at 29.00. Current price is 39.10 at 83525. Oomra 147 is 31.0 at 531. Broach 164 is 35.30 at 535.</p>
<h3>Rice Sales Increase Daily in River-Bound Rice Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the weather was drizzly and continuous at the New Gate. More than ten ships from various groups arrived, and sales improved. The top grade of Northern polished rice was in short supply, and prices rose by one jiao. Ordinary middle-grade rice also increased by five fen. Currently, the quoted prices for western-route unpolished rice are firm and stable. Due to the approaching Dragon Boat Festival in the local area, people are active. The supply of thin, early-season rice is scarce, and the price is good, rising by one chi. Foreign-pointed country rice and shop rice are selling briskly, with the opening price rising by one or two jiao. However, the source of supply from the interior has gradually increased recently, so there is no fear that the price will be too high later. The supply of top-grade sharp rice from the dam area remains scarce, and the price has not increased or decreased. The supply of metamorphosed glutinous rice is scarce, so the situation is tightening. Yesterday, two companies, Taikoo and Nissin, sent 8,000 bags of Saigon rice by ship, and the goods were piled up in foreign warehouses. The market price of mixed glutinous rice has already been released by the guild, approximately twelve yuan and a half.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, there were not many people in the market in South Shanghai. The road out of this street was smooth. Top-grade Northern polished rice from Changxi and Xixi is still in short supply. Most of it here is thin, and the ordinary market price is high. The market price rose by two jiao due to brisk sales. The price of Suzhou and Tong discounted rice for the four rural villages and retail sales is average, and the market looks tight by one jiao. The market for thin early-season rice from Nangang is active, and sales are better than the previous day, with high-quality rice rising by half a jiao. The supply of Du foreign-pointed rice is slightly less, and the market situation is stable. The demand for glutinous rice, metamorphosed glutinous rice, and sweet fermented rice is still good, and the prices have all risen by two jiao.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Yangzhong Spring Silkworm Production Is Poor, Prices Are Stable</h3>
<p>Silkworm body is superior, less inferior, more…Silkworm price is pulled at 50 yuan. In Yangzhong County, in places such as Sanmaogong, Laolang Street, Xinba, Zhutouqiao, Xinglongzhen, Yongan Island, and Youfangqiao, the early silkworms this year were completely unsuccessful, and the late ones were also not good. The silkworm production is extremely poor, with the overall batch being less than one-third of the annual amount. Less than ten silkworm firms have opened their scales. The silkworm body is superior, less inferior, and more. The scales have been open for five or six days, and the amount of silkworms collected by each firm is not strong, and the silkworm price is not high. The high price of superior silkworms is only fifty-three or four yuan, and the ordinary price is forty-four or five yuan, with an average of fifty yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Sugar Prices Started Weak and Then Strengthened</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's district telegrams, because of the value of Sunday, no telegrams arrived. The market for association trading was slightly stable, and buying gradually turned active. The transaction price of No. 24 Dutch sugar coarse white was still eleven taels and four qian, and No. 20 medium white was scarce at ten taels and eight qian ex-warehouse. The market was quite brisk. The import and export of Japanese sugar was also active, and the market price was slightly chaotic. The price of Meiji YRO mark was ten taels and nine qian, while the price of Minghua goods was eleven taels and five fen. The difference between the high and low prices was particularly rare. TDM mark was called at eleven taels and two qian, and SH mark was eleven taels and one qian, but there were few recipients. Dongbing was eighteen taels, YT mark was eleven taels and three qian, Z mark was eleven taels and three qian and a half, YP mark was eleven taels and seven qian, and one mark was eleven taels and seven qian and a half, all of which were quite brisk. In the quotation board, the price of domestic He Song ice was eight taels and three qian, and the price of Jiamei ice was eight taels and two qian. Several dozen boxes were opened for each, and the market was not odd, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Galvanized Iron Wire, New Goods Have Arrived</h3>
<p>Since the galvanized iron wire from the military has been purchased, the market has become active. The standard has gradually increased from four taels and five qian to five taels. However, since the last large transaction, the stock in the market has been extremely weak, so the market is quite outstanding. Yesterday, the Mitsubishi, HSBC and other warehouses reported that a large number of spot goods had been loaded, and the future will definitely be lively, it is said.</p>
<h3>White Iron Sheet Traded 600-700 Loads Yesterday</h3>
<p>The arrival of white iron sheet has been scarce for a long time, so the market stock is weak, as this newspaper has reported long ago. Since the arrival of spot goods at the Huashun and Taikoo warehouses the day before yesterday, the market has been lively. Although it rained yesterday, the transaction volume was still as high as six or seven hundred loads. The price was estimated at sixteen taels per load for No. 22, sixteen taels and five qian for No. 24, sixteen taels and seven qian and a half for No. 26, seventeen taels and two qian and a half for No. 28, and eighteen taels and two qian and a half for No. 31, it is said.</p>

<h3>Characters in "The Liar"</h3>
<p>— Huang Jun</p>
<p>The news of the 11th public performance of Henry Jones' masterpiece "The Liar" by the Fuliang Drama Club has been spreading for a long time. It will be held at the school's gymnasium at 8 pm on the 1st of this month, and will soon come to Shanghai to meet with theater lovers at sea. Now, the names and conditions of the performers of the main characters in the play are written to the readers.</p>
<p>Tang Xuanfan, graduated from the Department of Foreign Literature of Fuliang College of Arts in the winter of the 20th year. He has played important roles in the drama performances of the club. Last year, he successfully played Christian in the public performance of "Cyrano". This time, he specially sacrificed his precious time to play the main character Lin Wangxian in "The Liar". He has performed heroes with strong personalities, and he has also performed romantic lovers. This time, he plays a role who has seen the world, and he can show his strengths.</p>
<p>Wu Zhongmin, from Haining, Zhejiang, a student of the Department of Foreign Literature of Fuliang College of Arts, will graduate after the summer vacation of this year. He is also a backbone member of the club. This time, he plays the main character Zhang Jingkai, and he is quite diligent in his duties.</p>
<p>Liang Peishu, Ms. Liang is a student of the Department of Foreign Literature and will graduate this quarter. She is from Changsha, Hunan, and lived in the United States since childhood. She speaks fluent English. In this year's four university English debates, Ms. Liang won first place individually, and Ms. Liang's Mandarin pronunciation is also very accurate. She speaks eloquently, and she has studied the principles of drama very well, and she is also quite experienced on stage. Last year, she played Roxanne, the main character in Cyrano, and she was praised on the same day. This time, she plays Mrs. Tang, Han Yilan, and her performance is much more advanced than before.</p>
<p>Li Lian, a student of the Department of Sociology, from Chuxian, Anhui, will also graduate this winter. She is better at learning than academics, and she is also good at sports. However, she has been rarely seen on the playground in recent years. Perhaps her interest has also diminished. Recently, she has been very interested in drama. She also played a role in Cyrano. Now she plays Mrs. Ye, Han Yizhi. Han Yizhi's full of affection can be completely revealed between her expressions and movements, moving many viewers.</p>
<p>Ouyang Meide, she is from Wuchang, Hubei, a student of the Department of Accounting. She transferred to this school in the autumn of last year. She joined the Fudan Drama Club for the first time. She plays Gu Ruofen, Lin Wangxian's lover, and her identity is just right.</p>
<p>Li Qinquan is the sister of Ms. Li Ni. She is a student of the Department of Chinese Literature and plays Mrs. Yao, Han Yiju, very appropriately. Jin Xianjie is the daughter of Mr. Jin Wensi, a graduate of Fudan University. She is a preparatory student and is known in the school for her gentleness and generosity. Playing Meixiang is also quite able to perform the character of the character in the play.</p>
<p>Lu, she is from Guilin, Guangxi. She entered the Department of Sociology of Fuliang last autumn. Before entering Fuliang, she once performed drama at the Arts and Entertainment Association of the Department of Sociology of the school, and she was quite famous. This time, she joined The Liar to play Miss Wang Ma, and she was also praised by the audience for her sophistication.</p>
<p>The above is only a part of it. There are also Mr. Wu Tieyi, Yang Shouwen, Wu Wenqing, Kong Ling, Wu Dingxin, Li Anfu, Huang Wenhua, Zhang Runmin and others. Due to the limited space, I was unable to describe them in detail. I will introduce them again when I have the opportunity. I apologize for this.</p>
<h3>She and She</h3>
<p>— Liu Fujuan</p>
<p>"If I see anyone pulling friends in the future, I will write down their names and not allow them to go home," the supervisor said sternly to the students.</p>
<p>That day was the date of the self-government association meeting of a certain school. Why was the supervisor so strict? It's funny to say it, because the atmosphere of a certain school is to like "pulling girlfriends." Those primary school students are even more energetic. For example, you think she is a bit special, but you must not praise her beauty or criticize her. If you accidentally say it and someone else hears it, haha, they will say, "You like her!"</p>
<p>It's not just saying it, they will also pull you into a good room, or pull you two out for a run. What do you call that? Haha, it's called "thinking of a girlfriend." If someone is next to you... not a friend, they will call her a good name, a light bulb... not ventilated, stinky radish...</p>
<p>Sometimes they also draw a heart shape on the blackboard. In the middle, they write the word "love." Above the word "love" is the word "Love," and below the word "love" is the word "Kiss." Then they write her name and her name on both sides of the word "love," on both sides of the heart. There are also words written that say that even if you wipe it off, you still love, and even if you don't wipe it off, you still love.</p>
<p>Every evening after night class or on Saturday night... no night class, it's very noisy outside the room. In the sound, most are "thinking of friends," or the sound of pulling friends, laughter, and shouts, which makes people feel noisy. In the alley, all you see are pairs of friends, so crowded that there is almost no way to walk. All you hear are footsteps, like soldiers marching. It's really lively.</p>
<p>But those who want to study can't stand it. When the representatives met, they reported to the supervisor. At first, the representatives went to talk to them, but they still couldn't stop them. There was no way but to ask the supervisor to come out in person. After scolding them, things got a lot better.</p>
<p>Why are they so afraid of having their names written down? It's not because they are afraid of having points deducted, but because they are afraid of not being able to go home.</p>
