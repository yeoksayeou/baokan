<p>調查團委員定三人</p>
<p>同意日本有警務權</p>
<p>芳澤提出正式牒文</p>
<p>拒絕設立中立區案</p>
<p>白里安向芳澤解釋</p>
<p>（巴黎）國聯理事會對於滿洲事件之和平處置方法、今日顯有重要之進展、但日本之態度則復見倔强、理事會特别起草委員會於上午集議討論甚久、而理事會今日復於下午四時召集會議、討論各項問題、茲記其節略如下、理事會討論之第一問題、爲調查委員團之組織、理事會茲已决定該委員團僅有委員三人、此外復有專家數人、意大利建議委員團應當增加人數、但此提案因日本之反對而取消、第二問題爲日本要求日軍在東省應有警務權以利剿匪工作之進行、此點聞已經理事會之同意、第三討論事項爲錦州設立中立區問題、日本代表芳澤對於此點、突向理事會提出覺書、堅持中國軍隊非撤至關内不可、因此理事會方面大爲驚異、蓋此不啻表示日本對於中立視察員之權力不予承認也、此點經理事會略爲辯論之後、即决定指令白里安向日本說明遣派中立視察員之原提案、前已經日本同意、該視察員雖不能謂爲國際聯盟直接派遣之代表、但實爲眞實情報之唯一來原、故該視察員應有自由行動之權、不得受有何種阻碍云、白里安今晚與芳澤晤談頗久、即係討論此問題、（二十九日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）起草委員會今晨十一時集議、未幾、施博士到會與議、至午前時始退出、起草委員會於施博士士後、續議十五分鐘、旋延會至午後四時、今晚五時行政會將開會、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）國聯理事會對於滿洲問題和平解决之進行、今日又受重大之打擊、其原因係由日代表芳澤於星期日夜間突向理事會會長白里安提出日本政府正式牒文、對於理事會在錦州設立中立區域之提案、表示拒絕、理事會方面因此大感失望、中立區域之設置、前已經中國容納、今日本態度驟爾中變、則理事會調停中日紛爭案件之希望、將愈减少、而將來理事會之通過保證日兵完全撤退之决議案、更難一致、即原有派遣中立調查委員團之建議、將來能否一致通過亦成一難題矣、恐此後理事會或中國代表團各將採取堅决行動以對日本、至芳澤提出之牒文、則爲重新宣言日本不願第三者干涉中日兩國間之糾紛、聞理事會會長白里安將向日本政府提出嚴厲之通告、使日本勿忘該國對於國聯盟約之義務云、再則日本牒文送達時、適在中國接受中立區域建議之後、當理事會談判之際、復有國聯之中立視察員來電證明中國軍隊集中錦州附近威嚇日本軍隊之說、實屬無稽、故更令人驚異也、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）日本覆函反對錦州附近設立中立區域後、今日白里安又函芳澤、勸東京政府重加考慮、函文甚長、詳陳理由、認其中必有誤會處、謂此項辦法、乃非常之手段、必須迅速施行、以免錦州北方發生衝突而傷生命、因此渠與各同僚認爲非常重要、務請以二十六日去函所列各種便利、給予若干國家派往當地之代表、此項非常手段、當可不致妨碍日本政府欲向中國政府提出之較大提議、且此議並不成爲第三者之干涉、故渠不得不謂其中定有誤會存在、敢請芳澤追想中國原議本有派遣國際軍隊一節、理事會因恐難于實行、故代以新提議、兹願重向日本政府建議云云、今晨十一時中國施總代表訪理事會起草委員、前此施氏又與國聯總秘書德魯蒙相見、聞所談係中國軍隊撤回關内後之保證條件、故現請中國已願放棄其派中立國軍隊至中立區域之要求、祇須日本有不侵犯該區之滿意保證可矣、但聞日本仍堅决保留其抵禦土匪之合法權利、今日英代表報告理事會、據星期六上午十一時英國當地視察員報告稱、中國司令部消息、日軍一混成隊佔據李家武坡站、中國鐵甲車已向打虎山退回、日軍正向溝帮子前進、其兩翼俱無確實消息云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本官塲表示希望、以爲設立中立區域之問題、因巴黎南京東京同時進行談判之結果、不久可美　解决、中立區域驚政問題、似爲主要阻力者不難應付、日本可允中國軍隊於剿匪必要時暫入中立區域、此種辦法、日本關東租借地業已行之、華兵於追捕擬逃入租借地之匪時、可許入租借地也、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）日本反對中立國視察員之參加、堅持與華人直接開議之要求、致時局極感困難、聞日本目的在阻止實際上國際委員團管理滿洲之創立、昨夜芳澤訪白里安、一再聲明日本態度、白里安致芳澤之原函、今日公佈如下、閣下以爲行政會之提議、含有請第三方面參加中日間可以直接解决的爭點之意、其實不然、余不禁認爲有誤會在焉、行政會所籌議者、乃危險事態中所須行之一種計畫、乃特殊的、且須從速進行以避免錦州雙方之衝突、及生命之喪失、是以行政會認以便利給予中立國代表、乃極重要事、且此種特殊辦法、無損於日政府所可提交中政府之最廣大的提案云、白里安函中並謂中國提議遣派國際軍隊事、行政會認爲涉及實施上困難故以此提議代之云、中代表稱、日軍佔據厲家窩舗、中國鐵甲火車已退至打虎山、北寗路火車現未能駛行於打虎山之北、又稱、馬占山已設立黑省政府於海倫云、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）赴滿調查團擴大之問題、今日由我草委員與日代表討論之、日代表雖不在原則上反對委員額數之擴大、但不贊成此種辦法、日代表以爲遇必要時、調查團可延專家相助（二十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）國聯行政會今日午後開會、繼續討論滿洲問題各點、至五時半休會、議長白里安昨往别墅休養、今日復回巴黎、專爲開會來也、日本所提出種種建議、意在保障日軍行動自由、以應付匪衆與不規則軍隊者、已得同情之考慮、認爲尙合情理、國聯方面今日對於滿案調查團之遣派、咸有一種印象、以爲可爲各方面所接受的方案之起草、當不致有何嚴重困難、祇須未有軍事新糾紛、如奪取錦州等事、以擾亂談判之趨向耳、起草委員將與中代表會商草案事、衆望各事可迅速就緒、錦州問題仍爲黑暗之點、白里安前建議宜立中立區域、由中日司令與各國視察員接洽節、中日皆已答覆、今日原文公布、中國照允、惟日本則謝絕第三國參加中日所可直接解决之事件、日本覆文之措詞、聞已引起行政會之疑懼、雖有芳澤之口頭保證、終不能釋然、駐法日使署參贊伊籐今日晤起草委員談一小時、討論日軍所可行之治匪行動、衆料此問題可不發生重大困難、惟中立區域問題、似較難辦理、中國答覆白里安建議之文、聲明已諭令錦州中國當道與各國視察員接洽、以避免與日軍接觸、而日本覆文則爲淓澤署名之公函形式、其文曰、關於余十一月二十七日一函、日政府現告余已國聯行政會繼續討論派遣調查團案⊙重光葵與顧維鈞恊商錦州中立區問題⊙北寗線日軍在新民以西者業已撤盡⊙顧維鈞就署理外交部長職⊙（見國内要電）倫敦日使館前昨有多人示威⊙（見國外要電）新銘輪赴日載運華僑</p>

<h3 id="c6">迷離情勢下之新危機 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>日來東北問題之交涉情形。以及國際態度。突呈迷離恍惚之情勢。其在日本者。則爲一方面天津之變亂再作。沿江各埠日人陰謀同時暴動之謠言四起。進迫錦州之軍隊。且一度重員。他一方面則日軍一部分又忽然撤退滿鐵綫内。幣原及南陸相參謀本部。都表示對錦州不作敵對之行動。其在國際者。則一方面國聯處處屈就日方。順從日方。他一方面則美國務卿史汀生復發表對日不滿意之言論。英國對日輿論亦顯呈激昻。其在我國者。則一方面在國内高唱收回失地之論他一方施肇基代表在國聯。則有種種遷就决議案之表示。依據此種現象而觀察。各方面情勢。都極爲矛盾。極爲模糊。使吾人如墮入五里霧中。無從捉摸當前事實之實相。</p>
<p>不過正惟目前各方面情勢之迷離恍惚。使吾人無從捉摸。故對於此一現象。國人都有切實注意之必要。吾人認爲當前迷離恍惚之情勢。已證明我國家已入於一新的嚴重時期。過去日人之迫害。今已變爲外交上之高壓過去日本一國之侵凌。今已變爲列國恊力以謀我。過去我國維護公理保全國士裁制强暴之熱忱與决心。今已日就低减。假使此一推斷不幸而言中。則吾人敢斷言「東北半壁河山。將從此永易其顔色。無復有收回之望矣。」</p>
<p>吾人認爲日軍一部分之所以突然撤退至滿鐵線内者。一則爲緩和國際之情勢。一則爲緩和我國内之民氣。以退爲進。以守爲攻。故意撤退一極小部分之軍隊。以轉移世人之視線。而遂其永遠强踞我東北之野心。國聯之所以不惜低首下心一意抑我袒日者。則爲欲以在我國土内建立極其滑稽之所謂中立區域。阻止日軍錦之一事實以維持其奄奄一息之生命。并可借此休會。任我國與日本直接談判。至前日日軍西迫錦州之際美英諸國之所以突然表示嚴厲干涉之態度者。則又以錦州以西爲非日人之勢力範圍日人不適可而止。且欲西向挺進。侵及他國之勢力圈。故英美不得不以强硬之態度。制抑其過度伸張之勢力。此種事實。極爲顯明。故英美之斥日。非爲愛我。抑且正爲企圖分割中國各攫一臠之具體表現。國人慎勿以日軍撤退英美助我而頓感欣慰。須知東北之失地尙未收復。滿鐵線内之日軍隨時仍可發動英美亦絕非誠意助我。當國聯休會之日即我國與日本正面交涉之時。來日艱難正多。絕不容吾人有半點之鬆懈與欣慰。</p>
<p>我當局在東北尙未收復之前。亦絕不容表示憚煩退縮。而稍有所遷就。使我東北陷於萬刧無可回復之地步。蓋此時我國家已臨到新的嚴重時期。我國人其注意。我政府其尊重民意。維護公理。維民族生命而奮鬥到底。</p>

<p>大美晚報二十八日瀋陽電云、日軍突然撤退之原因、此間猶毫無所聞、但關東司令本莊確似有立即開始撤回滿鐵附屬地之决意、據日司令部發言人今日聲稱、北寗路日軍將於今夜開始撤退、日司令部已通知日租界内僑民、着自今夜起、準備在其宅内借寓軍官、記者詢以撤扶程度、答稱、先行回復未佔領齊齊哈爾以前地位、其意蓋謂除鄭家屯吉林城巨流河與營口等處、仍駐日軍外、其餘日軍悉數撤回、至最後　兵、據稱將俟中日間政治局勢最後調整後、始將日軍完全撤回滿鐵附屬地、恢復九月十八日以前地位云云、又聞朝鮮開來之日軍、因朝鮮形勢危急、現將立即開回原防、美敎士之自朝鮮來瀋者、僉謂各地鮮人、皆思乘機發動、獨立起義、即在眉睫、</p>
<p>午間續電云、頃日軍司令部發言人、忽以一新聞稿非正式發交各報、標題爲關東軍對於錦州之態度、内稱瀋陽日軍鑒於天津時局緊急、故决定取必要步驟、分配防軍、今天津局勢旣有進步、故又决定將前向錦州方面出動軍隊、悉行撤回遼河以東及滿鐵附屬地、以待時局未來之發展、現日軍已開始撤退、滿鐵附屬地外各處駐兵、將逐漸減至最少限度、遼河以西則除酌留少數日軍保護新民日領署外、其餘各地日軍、正在撤退中、又正式發表板倉上尉、率偵牒兵士乘鐵甲車至饒陽河之東、與華軍相遇、板倉及一動務兵中彈而死、又有南滿路職工兩人受傷、最後日司令部發言人、又否認此次突然撤兵、由於日内瓦與東京方面之政治發展、聲稱、僅屬一種策略云、</p>
<p>又晚間續電云、北寗路日軍已開始撤退、今日下午六時許、業有兩列車載兵士大砲及其他軍用品等開回滿鐵、此間外交界及國聯視察代表軍事參贊與外報通訊員等、紛紛評論此事、有一部份外報通訊員與若干軍事視察員、决意舉行慶祝、信爲東三省第二凱洛格式戰爭之結果、至撤兵理由、傳說不一、有謂出於紐約銀行家之壓力者、有謂由於英人反對日軍之佔用北寗路者、有謂因國聯將派調查團者、又有稱由於東京政治上理由者、更有謠傳土肥原已在津與中國軍事當道訂秘密和平之約者、東京來瀋之外國軍事視察家、今日侵晨、猶乘本橋所備專車向錦州出發、想在途見日兵車之絡繹開回、當不免有一番驚疑也、又聞有中國散兵一隊、似示知日本撤兵、在新民之外數哩處掘斷鐵路、致日軍之撤退延緩若干時、待工程車開往修竣後、始克駛過、記者頃往皇姑屯車站、聞昨日自上午五時至午夜該站開過日兵車十三列、共二百二十一輛、今晨七時十分、又駛過給　車一　、均向錦州方面進發、但記者到站時、則已靜寂如死、英工程師已返瀋、僅一華職員留站照料、至齊齊哈爾及洮昻路沿　、據日司令部發言人稱、齊齊哈爾駐軍不久將撤回一大隊、洮南日軍或將撤回云、</p>

<h3 id="c54">瀋陽事件之 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>日本中心輿論</p>
<p>暗示出第二期大陸政策的成熟</p>
<p>東京通訊、從九月十八日瀋陽事變發生到最近先後已兩匝月、過去的關处樂士、如今已荒凉滿目、而問題還依然在暗雲愁霧之中、現在暫時避去事實的檢討、介紹幾個關於瀋陽事件的日本輿論、日人的用心、不已昭然若揭嗎、</p>
<p>第一個這是一個日本有力在野黨（政友會）的主張、他有四個具體的中心思想、（一）滿蒙在遠東的地位和歷史的關係上、完全是一塊與中國無關連的特殊地方、（二）全部滿蒙都以「門户開放」和「機會均等」主義、促進經濟的發達、同時使滿蒙成爲一個内外人安住之地、（三）維持滿蒙之治安、確守日本之權益、（四）有侵迫上項三要旨者、舉全國之力以對抗之、這個理論的演繹、他們認滿蒙爲日本的領地、乘這次瀋陽事件的機會、應該舉全國的兵力、剷除逼土地上的「支那」勢力、同時還應淸算一下幣原外交」的無能、此種論調、在目前爲显有力、</p>
<p>第二個呌「支那」尊重條約上的權益、在另一方面、應該聯絡友邦、而不使陷日本於孤絕之境、換句話說、「日英同盟」消滅以後、日本在最近的世界上、已失去了感情融洽的國家、在目前瀋陽事件勃發之時、更不能不聯絡一個可支持日本滿蒙政策的友邦、這一點輿論很抨擊日本外務當局的不努力、最少限度、也抨擊日本外務當局的努力不足、此爲一般並通輿論之意見、</p>
<p>第三個　這個主張、也是一個窮凶極惡的軍人代表、他以爲日本外務當局、「要求尊重條約和確認權益的提案爲錯誤、說明白一點、滿蒙與日本有甚深的關係、誰侵犯滿蒙、就應該討伐誰、世界干涉滿蒙、就應該視世界爲敵人、所以這次瀋陽事件、不僅爲「支那」的不尊重條約、簡直是「支那」襲擊日本的理想領地、滿蒙應以最後的决心對付之、</p>
<p>第四個這一個妙論出於日本之外交界他以爲處理瀋陽事件的重大問題、應由國際聯盟組織一專門委員會、在委員會中考究一個解决滿蒙的合理方法、結局這解决方法、是採用「委任統治制度」、同時在這委任統治制度之下、確立我東北未來的運命、</p>
<p>第五個這是一個社會主義者眼中的觀察、他認爲目前日本之滿蒙權益擁護爲不合理、他說目前日本的滿蒙投資、雖爲額已達十五億圓、但大部分却都是財閥的投資、所謂滿蒙權益的擁護、不過造成幾個布爾喬其之利潤增大而已、在這種情形之下、日本斷乎没有犧牲十萬生靈·二十萬國費·的必要、然而倘若在資本主義日本崩潰以後、社會是主義日本産生之時、那却値得因滿蒙而决戰一下、蓋社會主義的滿蒙權益擁護、是全體日本國民的生活線、此論較覺新鮮些、</p>
<p>在上述五個代表輿論之中、不問發言者的立塲如何、不問言論之抨擊日本現政府與否、這裏面似乎都存在着「滿蒙維護」的一貫主張、而極明顯的暗示出日本第二期大陸政策的成熟、最近瀋陽事件的爆發、祇是一種孕婦的肚痛現象而已、長夜漫漫、前途眞不忍設想、目前第三次國際理事會雖已召集、吾人敢斷國際間决無正義可言、圖存總貴自强、日本可以不住的侵略大陸、中國豈能不住的求助國聯哉、（十一月十八日）</p>

<p>— 奚小驊</p>
<p>明季嘉慶年間。倭寇擾我江陰。時邑宰錢鶴洲。荆州人。年二十六歲。與楊厙䔑橋人許蓉義僕朱貴。防守抵禦。卒殉難。其義烈忠勇。足以風後世。時嘉靖三十三年。澄有倭警適迎春日。止留東門出入。餘三門俱閉。以防變也。臨晚外人蜂擁入城。門壅塞。踏死者四十七人。四月二十八日。倭從黃泗浦突至䔑橋。許蓉已豫塞港口。錢公命率民兵却之。又有别倭自南來。蓉回軍迎擊於楊厙之北。地名三官堂。賊弩亂發。兵無甲盾。遂走。義僕陳許蓉僅以身免。賊所過焚殺甚慘。蓉家亦焚。許蓉曾有詩以紀之云。挈妻抱子馬前遮。到處攢眉泣喪家。廬舍蕩然灰烈燄路途迷却眼昏花寥寥舊址傷春燕慘慘殘骸飽晚鴉。舉目荒凉無限恨。更從何處樂生涯。</p>
<p>嘉靖三十四年。倭寇合常熟之寇三千餘人。從江分半。寇淸江。半入蔡港登陸而來。邑宰錢公。正奉兵備王崇古命。率兵援靖得報急返。而倭已至大橋。攻城不克。退守察涇閘。（即現名南閘鎭）日夜掠刦。烟火接天鄕民入城避難者。日近萬人。錢公忿欲作戰。而邑兵不過四百人。合兩廣兵祇千人。遂於六月二十三日。出城搏戰。先是兩廣兵縱肆。公懲以法。遇賊先遁。錢獨與親兵五十餘人。奮然迎敵。有親兵楊成。恨倭屠戮忠勇尤甚。錢遇倭接戰九里灣。俗名磨盤墩。（現在南門外）地險馬仆。楊成急以乘馬易之。忽草間倭冦伏兵齊起。以刀剌錢公。身被數刃。仍力竭與賊血戰。倭衆以槊戳錢。體麋如醢而死。與錢遇難者。義兵二十餘人。邑人薛甲從亡卒中。哭而殮之。</p>

<p>— 賀天健</p>
<p>志摩死矣。人生營營·固無日不向死境進行也。死固不能免。則死亦何足攖人悲哉。雖然。人情之所系。才能之所關。而死乃有泰山鴻毛之分矣蓋志摩之死。而不死於國難。而不死於學術。而不死　其他一切有關社會與個人者。乃死於飛機之附乘中。死不得其所。生命輕於鴻毛乃爲人情之所　不堪考。而亦爲志摩自身雖死而不願也。故人於志摩之死。無有不惜其才而　其刧也。志摩之學殖才能夫人而知之矣。茲不復贅。志摩南歸後相値於現代名畫展鹽會中見其夫人小曼女士之畫。意趣似甚得。而於余頗致其感謝之意。實則小曼女士於畫道。研究固有案也。余不過聊備其咨詢耳。况咨詢時間亦頗少。何足以言傳習哉。别時約爲持螯之叙。蓋志摩自硤石家中來。携有無腸公子一簍。硤石產蟹固頗著名者。余隔一日過其庽。志摩自外入。握手言懽。倍致拳拳。未幾。即圍坐食蟹。兜充臍淸。尖團均美。座中有不善食者。志摩敎以分剖法。食次談及乘福特機在京平道中情况。言自黃河以北。下視田疇皆作紫黑色。自河以南。下視田原皆作赤色。甚爲光潔。阡陌徑界之分佈。　歷如棋枰。章章有序。言及市井道路人烟聚處。則如蟻團蠓聚。營營不息。至此忽歎息曰。不圖此區區之間。而有所謂愁樂之擾擾耶余曰。南華秋水之篇。於此三致意焉。予何復有此感哉。小曼女士以志摩目疾未愈。即勸少食。志摩因爲余曰。余最嗜此物。在北平時。目疾由是而得。現且愈矣。復勸余等多食余因晚餐已進。盡其二。志摩復飲酒三杯。興會淋漓。即離坐而起。引吭高歌。並作鸜鵒之舞。此際之樂。誠非生平所有也。余以吳子觀蠡託余要志摩法書。蓋已三年矣。乘此乃要志摩書。志摩興酣落筆。爲書屈原漁父篇。旣竣。絕似鄭海藏夜已闌。余乃與握手言别。志摩曰。余此去僅三星期即返。相見不遠也。相與致意而行。翌晨。余亦乘車返錫嗚乎。孰知此半宵之懽叙。即爲志摩一生末日前之第二晚耶。哀哉余與志摩無深長之交情。第神交則有年矣。至其夫人小曼女士從余學畫山水。而相見之時乃多。然亦僅在上半年也。自五月至今。余以事冗天熱。告假三四日。及上月。余始釋假。乃又與志摩相叙。而此一叙乃又爲最後之一叙嗚乎哀哉。志摩因中國畫史無精善之作。曾約余編中國畫家史傳。曾與余較臂力。志摩蓋亦學武術者。嗚呼志摩。哀哉志摩。</p>

<h3 id="c103">歌爲君耳 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— 老曼</p>
<p>莎翁有一詩。題爲「歌爲君耳」。Ｓinging　for　you　嘗譯其意爲五言散文。刋諸禮拜六周刋。云、「我歌爲愛君。不愛此歌聲。歌聲杳何在。憶在君心頭。苟君長相思。我歌永怡悅。一朝君遠别。聊可自慰藉。明燈耀歡夜。笑語忘歸去。爲君再歌唱。今夜當安適。寂寥無復有。彷彿儂相親。我歌爲愛君君勿忘我情。」詩之意境甚佳。惜無生花之筆爲譯作韻文也。</p>
<p>前日偶往觀影。聞露斯蔡德頓女士之歌聲。彷彿即莎翁之歌也。名士名曲。出諸美人檀口。益覺嫵媚入骨。愚素不愛有聲影片。以歐人語音。終覺其不能悉辦。獨於聲片中之情歌。則輒獲一二佳什。甚矣歌聲之動人也。</p>
<p>我國自古以來。於樂歌之研究。亦不遺餘力。而韻聞艶跡。又往往藉歌聲以傳。稗史之中。尤多歌場舊一。傳誦益廣。最近明星影片公司所出聲片「如此天堂」及「歌女紅牡丹」以及天一影片公司所出聲片「歌塲春色」。均有歌塲以爲點綴。所惜者。表演與情感。或尙嫌其不盡融洽耳。</p>
<p>最近宣京琳女士語余。新爲明星影片公司攝一「玉人永别」片。片爲無聲之作。由大導演家鄭正秋君導演。其女主角名玉人。爲一歌女。我人於片中雖不能聞歌聲。然自該片之情節以觀。覺情節之緊張。與夫情感之濃厚。殆爲國産片中空前之作品。而令觀衆有「此時無聲勝有聲」之感也。</p>
<p>宣女士善歌。人盡知之。然在「玉人永别」片中。不以歌聲動人。而能以細膩之表情見其長倘亦如莎翁詩中所謂「歌聲杳何在憶在君心頭」之意存乎其中耶。</p>

<p>去歲夏。糞翁曾展覽其書刻於覺林。一時裙屐紛集。贊嘆不絕。鵑亦爲文誌其事。今糞翁又出新作。仍公同好。何其盛也。翁年未四十。而四法俱工。於篆隸尤絕。如五尺聯「下眼九萬里。坐看十八公。」神韵直似伊秉綬。五尺珊瑚牋鐘鼎對。臨錢十蘭。絕無時下奔放惡習。而得自然之氣。五尺中堂書岳武穆滿江紅全闋亦屬工夫老到。一氣呵成。余更愛其四尺立軸。篆書三秦紀民謠。爐火純靑。柔而不媚。淸而不緇。摩挲愛玩。不忍釋手。時王西神先生亦至。獨賞其「尙有一椽留宿燕。豈無半黍到池魚。」謂爲仁者之言。而不知此詩集自何家。叩諸糞翁。謂爲已作。蓋翁固工於詩者也。塲中陳列印譜亦多精警之作。規摹秦漢。各極其妙。西神購二部去。余亦因事不可久留。廢然返。而腦際眼底。猶彷佛見花牋印子。紅耀於三眞六草間云。</p>

<p>— 海客</p>
<p>自由車城據最近調查所得。那久已受人厭棄的自由車（脚踏車）似乎又在風行起來。因爲自由車廠中的出品。比過去的七八年間已激增了。雖然這幾年在幾個較大的都會中。已難得看見自由車的踪影。而有幾處城鎭。仍有自由車城之稱。即如英國的培德福。Ｂedford便是一座最著名的自由車城。以人口作比例。其自由車之多。冠於英國全部。這大槪是爲了四周地面平坦之故。坐車人旣多。所以一般商店。都有特别的停放自由軍的設備。使顧客們得到不少利便除培德福之外。如丹麥的首都科本海根Ｃopenhagen幾人人都坐自由車。</p>
<p>海牙Hague也是如此。這兩處稱爲自由車城。眞可當之無愧。德京柏林在工人們上工下工之際街道中也塡塞了自由車城外各工廠中。都有車間容納那千百輛自由車。因爲要人們以此代步。是最便宜而最容易的。</p>

<p>— 葉華女士</p>
<p>吾國領土首先被倭鄰强佔者。厥爲琉球。繼及臺灣。一八九五年。馬關條約簽訂。李經芳銜命會日將樺山行臺灣授受式後。從茲臺灣淪於異族。萬刦不復。昨臺南報張君赴英過滬。中國報學社上海社社友餞行。席間談臺灣報紙。處至逆之境。奮至綿之力。欷歔流涕。不能自勝。爰記一二。豈僅如陸賈之新語已哉。</p>
<p>報紙御用今歲户口調查。臺灣現有人數四百五十六萬。日報週刋各四。皆係日人半官半民創辦。臺北者曰臺灣日日新聞。日銷一萬五千。全臺首屈一批。臺中有臺灣新聞。日刋八千。臺南爲臺南新報。每日一萬。花連江設東臺灣報。日售三千。週刋在臺北有經世新報。每次五千。南日本新報三千一次。昭和新報南瀛新報各二千。新高新報。在於基降。週銷六千。以上各報。皆日政府御用報紙。一字一句。唯日人之命是聽。政府指鹿爲馬。則各報皆以鹿爲馬矣。夕發一新聞。早見各報。隻字不得改動。對中國問題。往往指摘中傷。黑白顚倒。</p>
<p>日刋限制上述八種御用報紙外。日本大阪朝日。每日各大報亦均輸入。日約數千。臺人憤同胞之入水火。言論之不自由。乃聚紳民志士。組織臺灣新民株式會社。視中國爲祖國。稱僑臺漢人。集欵三十七萬。從事民族運動。提撥十萬。編輯臺灣新民報。暗中鼓吹民族革命。喚醒民族意識。該報遂爲日人眼中釘。蹂躪摧殘。不遺餘力。然該報不屈不撓。苦心孤詣。維持十稔。銷數近萬。屢欲改刋日報。輒受禁止。蓋報紙每日出版。須獲日當局之許可證而後始能通行無阻也。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>鄕下人見馬路上的包車，似穿梭一般的飛快的往來，把他看得呆了。他不但看見那些女諸葛手中都持看光怪陸離，五色紛披的羽扇，而且看見他們手中都挾着一個小小的皮夾。鄕下人疑心這些姑娘的皮夾裏，安放着什麽東西呢？難道都是女學生們，到學堂裏去念書嗎？但是夜裏念什麽書？除非是上海開了不少的半夜女學校吧。不然，或者都是些女店員，挾着了那個皮夾，出去到人家去收賬的嗎？可是坐了那種漂亮的車子，這種收賬員，未免太闊了吧。</p>
<p>還有一輛包車，正從鄕下人身邊，擦肩過去，他覺眼前一亮，原來那包車上，裝了不少的電燈。鄕下人把那包車上的電燈一數，剛剛是七盞，鄕下人不覺靈機一動，</p>
<p>一對了丨對了！這是一個唱戲的！伊的名字呌做七盞燈。我曾經聽得到過上海的人說過··有個唱花旦的，名字呌做七盞燈。我正不知道爲什麽呌七盞燈？現在你看這車子上，不明明是裝着七盞燈嗎？這定是七盞燈無疑了。」</p>
<p>鄕下人東張西望，他忘記了呌黃包車去尋他的外甥，只是信步的走，越走越。到了熱閙的地方，却見一處，電車是四通八達：紅綠燈是忽明忽暗；汽車是首尾相接，這一輛汽車的頭，頂着了前面汽車的屁股，前面汽車的頭，也頂了再前　汽車的屁股了。黃包車上那些漂亮的姑娘的香水香，和拉黃包車的苦力身上的汗酸臭，氤氲在一處，弄成了一種香夾臭。最奇怪的是一位印度黑炭先生，高高的站在馬路中心一根旗竿的斗裏，鄉下人想：他乘風凉乘在那個地方去，可謂得其所哉！得其所哉！</p>
<p>近來新流行的一種年紅電光燈，有紅色的，有綠色的，有黃色的。到了天一黑了，便五光十色，各處都通明了。他們是什麽公司？什麽店號？在遠遠地就望見了。紅的字，便鑲了綠的邊：黃的字，又鑲了紅的邊；鄕下人正看得呆了。一路只是逐家的望過去，看到一家，出是一座大建築，却見有兩個紅的電光的字，很大的照耀在上面道：「反占。」</p>
<p>鄕下人見了，不覺怒從心上發，憤向膽邊生·握緊了拳頭，衝向那店家去，口中却嚷道：</p>
<p>「打！打！打！打死那個漢奸！打死那個賣國賊！打死那個冷血動物！」</p>

<p>華東社記者、昨謁張市長、訽以本埠治安等各問題、蒙詳答如下、</p>
<p>戒嚴原因　張氏首述此次本市前晚特别戒嚴之原因、實以連日謠諑頻繁、日浪人與流氓、企圖暴動之報告、市當局屢有所聞、若二十七日、屢傳楊樹浦北四川路一帶、有大批浪人流氓、企謀不軌、而租界當局、亦屢有所聞、市當局雖對本市治安、業已有充分之佈置、惟鑒於謠諑繁興、寗可信其或有、不可信其必無、故不得不施行戒嚴、以爲預防、據今日情形·似已緩和不少、關於外傳日人在滬、實已預定如何計劃、以余觀之、相信日當局不致有此謬舉、惟日本之無識浪人、或難免有越軌之舉、希圖引起巨大交涉、惟市當局業已深切注意之、本市治安、决不致有意外發生也</p>
<p>接收委員　張氏又談關於接收東北失地一事、國府前委本人充任接收委員、當時因鑒本市情形之嚴重、故曾電請另簡賢能、惟國府方面、迄今尙未准許、至於接收事宜、顧維鈞氏、前曾在平召集人員、草擬細則、後以日方之遲疑觀望、迄未實現、此次顧氏由平南下之初、即致電本人、邀往商討、余以本市情形、尙不能輕離一步、故未赴京</p>
<p>安定金融　日來本埠、因受時局之影響、現銀缺乏、市塲大感恐慌、據張氏謂、本市流動現銀、據余所聞、約達七千萬元、並所有各銀行之鈔幣、約達四萬萬、民衆因感時局之影響、約儲現金、各銀行更相繼屯積、益以裝運出口、接濟他埠、因此種種關係、恐慌自不可免、市當局對於此事、迭曾討論、覺安定金融、首在安定人心、至禁運出口、在事實上、實屬困難之至、</p>
<p>今日抽簽　張氏繼述及本市業務之進行、謂一切照常　毫無停頓、市中心區第二次公開領地、業定今日舉行、關於中央財政緊縮、本市方面絕對不受影響良以本市經濟、雖不富裕、然平時幸能量入爲出、故尙不覺困難也云云、</p>

<p>新銘歷史　新銘輪係招商局外洋輪之最新式者、行駛最速、建於一九零七年、載重二千一百三十三噸、曾奉令赴神户裝蔡松坡靈柩返國、在日本大地震時、送賑災米赴橫濱、船主爲馬家駿、大副錢毓佳、二副朱士高、全船工作人員、計一百六十人、</p>

<p>Submitting to Japan's Intentions</p>
<p>Committee of Inquiry Set at Three Members</p>
<p>Agrees to Japan's Policing Powers</p>
<p>Yoshizawa Submits Formal Note</p>
<p>Refusing to Establish a Neutral Zone</p>
<p>Briand Explains to Yoshizawa</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Council has made significant progress today regarding the peaceful resolution of the Manchurian Incident, but Japan's attitude has become stubborn again. The special drafting committee of the Council met this morning for a lengthy discussion, and the Council reconvened this afternoon at 4:00 PM to discuss various issues. A summary is as follows: The first issue discussed by the Council was the composition of the commission of inquiry. The Council has now decided that the commission will only have three members, plus several experts. Italy suggested increasing the number of commissioners, but this proposal was withdrawn due to Japan's opposition. The second issue was Japan's request for the right to station troops in the eastern provinces for the purpose of suppressing bandits. It is reported that the Council has agreed to this. The third item discussed was the establishment of a neutral zone in Jinzhou. Regarding this point, Japanese representative Yoshizawa suddenly submitted a memorandum to the Council, insisting that Chinese troops must withdraw inside the Great Wall. This greatly surprised the Council, as it indicated that Japan did not recognize the authority of the neutral observers. After some debate, the Council decided to instruct Briand to explain to Japan that the original proposal to send neutral observers had already been agreed upon by Japan. Although these observers could not be said to be directly dispatched by the League of Nations, they were the only source of true information, and therefore should have the freedom to act without any obstruction. Briand met with Yoshizawa for a long time tonight to discuss this issue. (National News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The drafting committee met at 11:00 AM this morning. Shortly afterward, Dr. Shih joined the meeting and participated in the discussion. He left at noon. The drafting committee continued its discussions for fifteen minutes after Dr. Shih's departure, and then adjourned the meeting until 4:00 PM in the afternoon. The administrative council will meet at 5:00 PM tonight. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The progress of the League of Nations Council towards a peaceful resolution of the Manchurian issue suffered another major blow today. The reason is that the Japanese representative, Yoshizawa, suddenly presented the Council President, Briand, with a formal note from the Japanese government on Sunday night, rejecting the Council's proposal to establish a neutral zone in Jinzhou. The Council was greatly disappointed by this. The establishment of a neutral zone had previously been accepted by China. Now that Japan's attitude has suddenly changed, the Council's hope of mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute will be further reduced. It will be even more difficult for the Council to pass a resolution guaranteeing the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops. It is also doubtful whether the original proposal to dispatch a neutral commission of inquiry can be unanimously adopted in the future. It is feared that the Council or the Chinese delegation will take firm action against Japan. The note submitted by Yoshizawa is a renewed declaration that Japan does not want a third party to interfere in the disputes between China and Japan. It is reported that Council President Briand will issue a stern warning to the Japanese government, reminding Japan not to forget its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant. Furthermore, the Japanese note was delivered after China accepted the neutral zone proposal. During the Council's negotiations, a cable from the League of Nations neutral observers proved that the claim that Chinese troops were concentrated near Jinzhou to threaten Japanese troops was groundless, which was even more surprising. (National News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After Japan replied rejecting the establishment of a neutral zone near Jinzhou, Briand sent another letter to Yoshizawa today, urging the Tokyo government to reconsider. The letter was very long and detailed the reasons, believing that there must be a misunderstanding. He said that this measure was an extraordinary means and must be implemented quickly to avoid conflicts and loss of life north of Jinzhou. Therefore, he and his colleagues considered it very important to provide representatives sent to the area by several countries with the conveniences listed in the letter of the 26th. This extraordinary measure should not hinder the larger proposals that the Japanese government wants to submit to the Chinese government, and this proposal does not constitute interference by a third party, so he had to say that there must be a misunderstanding. He dared to ask Yoshizawa to recall that the original Chinese proposal had a clause for sending international troops. The Council was afraid that it would be difficult to implement, so it replaced it with a new proposal. Now it is willing to re-recommend it to the Japanese government. This morning at 11:00, Chinese Chief Representative Shih visited the drafting committee of the Council. Before that, Mr. Shih also met with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond. It is said that what was discussed was the conditions for guaranteeing the withdrawal of Chinese troops inside the Great Wall. Therefore, China has now abandoned its request to send neutral troops to the neutral zone, as long as Japan has a satisfactory guarantee not to invade the area. However, it is said that Japan still firmly reserves its legitimate right to defend against bandits. Today, the British representative reported to the Council that according to a report from a British observer on the spot at 11:00 AM on Saturday, according to Chinese headquarters news, a mixed Japanese troop occupied the Lijiapowo station, and Chinese armored vehicles had retreated to Dagushan. The Japanese army was advancing towards Goubangzi, and there was no definite news on both wings. (National News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese officials expressed hope that the issue of establishing a neutral zone could be resolved soon through negotiations simultaneously in Paris, Nanjing, and Tokyo. The issue of the neutral zone's administration seemed to be the main obstacle, but it was not difficult to deal with. Japan could allow Chinese troops to temporarily enter the neutral zone when necessary to suppress bandits. This method has already been implemented in Japan's Kwantung Leased Territory. When Chinese soldiers are chasing bandits who intend to flee into the leased territory, they are allowed to enter the leased territory. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Japan's opposition to the participation of neutral country observers and insistence on direct discussions with the Chinese has made the situation extremely difficult. It is said that Japan's purpose is to prevent the establishment of an international committee to manage Manchuria in practice. Last night, Yoshizawa visited Briand and repeatedly stated Japan's attitude. Briand's original letter to Yoshizawa was published today as follows: Your Excellency believes that the proposal of the administrative council contains the meaning of asking a third party to participate in the disputes that can be directly resolved between China and Japan. In fact, it is not the case. I cannot help but think that there is a misunderstanding. What the administrative council is planning is a plan that must be carried out in dangerous situations. It is special and must be carried out quickly to avoid conflicts between the two sides in Jinzhou and the loss of life. Therefore, the administrative council believes that it is extremely important to provide the representatives of neutral countries with conveniences, and this special method does not harm the broadest proposals that the Japanese government can submit to the Chinese government. In his letter, Briand also said that the Chinese proposal to send international troops was deemed by the administrative council to involve difficulties in implementation, so this proposal was replaced by this. The Chinese representative said that the Japanese army occupied Lijiawo, the Chinese armored train had retreated to Dagushan, and the Beining Railway train was currently unable to travel north of Dagushan. He also said that Ma Zhanshan had established the Heilongjiang provincial government in Hailun. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The issue of expanding the delegation to Manchuria was discussed today by our drafting committee and the Japanese representative. Although the Japanese representative did not oppose the expansion of the number of commissioners in principle, he did not approve of this method. The Japanese representative believed that the delegation could extend expert assistance when necessary. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Administrative Council met this afternoon to continue discussing various aspects of the Manchurian issue, adjourning at 5:30. Chairman Briand went to his villa yesterday for a rest and returned to Paris today specifically to attend the meeting. The various suggestions put forward by Japan, intended to guarantee the freedom of action of Japanese troops to deal with bandits and irregular troops, have been given sympathetic consideration and are considered reasonable. Regarding the dispatch of the investigative mission, the League of Nations has a general impression that the drafting of a plan acceptable to all parties should not have any serious difficulties, as long as there are no new military disputes, such as the capture of Jinzhou, to disrupt the trend of negotiations. The drafting committee will consult with the Chinese representative on the draft. It is hoped that everything can be completed quickly. The Jinzhou issue is still a dark spot. Briand previously suggested establishing a neutral zone, with the Chinese and Japanese commanders and observers from various countries making contact with the festival. Both China and Japan have replied, and the original text was published today. China agreed, but Japan declined the participation of third countries in events that can be directly resolved between China and Japan. The wording of Japan's reply has aroused the fears of the Administrative Council, and even Yoshizawa's verbal assurances have failed to dispel them. Ito, the counselor of the Japanese embassy in France, met with the drafting committee today for an hour to discuss the bandit suppression actions that the Japanese army can take. It is expected that this issue will not cause major difficulties, but the neutral zone issue seems more difficult to handle. The Chinese reply to Briand's proposal stated that it had instructed the Chinese authorities in Jinzhou to contact observers from various countries to avoid contact with the Japanese army, while the Japanese reply was in the form of a public letter signed by Yoshizawa, which said: Regarding my letter of November 27th, the Japanese government now informs me that the League of Nations Administrative Council will continue to discuss the dispatch of the investigation team. ⊙ Shigemitsu Aoi and Koo Vi Kyuin consult on the Jinzhou Neutral Zone issue ⊙ Japanese troops west of Xinmin on the Beining Line have been completely withdrawn ⊙ Koo Vi Kyuin assumes the position of Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs ⊙ (See National News) Several people demonstrated at the Japanese Embassy in London the day before yesterday ⊙ (See Foreign News) The Xinming Wheel goes to Japan to transport overseas Chinese</p>

<p>Careful Study of Proposals Submitted by the Administrative Council. Japan's consistent policy for the genuine benefit of good relations between Japan and China has been to avoid resorting to the participation of third parties in disputes with China that can be resolved directly. In this case, who will adopt the same policy? Within these limits, Japan is always prepared to consider any method of avoiding conflict as much as possible. In this spirit, Japan welcomes the Chinese proposal forwarded by the French ambassador to Japan. Foreign Minister Shidehara at the time told the French ambassador that the Japanese government and the French government hoped to avoid hostile actions in Jinzhou, and informed them that if China completely withdrew its troops from Jinzhou to Shanhaiguan and west of it, and maintained only an administrative agency in Shanhaiguan, including the police used in the Jinzhou area, Japan could be prepared to guarantee in principle that Japanese troops would not enter the area ceded by Chinese troops, except in serious emergencies that endangered the lives and property of Japanese people. The above words of Foreign Minister Shidehara must have been conveyed to Your Excellency by the French ambassador. At the same time, the Japanese government also stated that it was prepared to instruct local Japanese qualified officials to contact the local Chinese authorities at any time to make practical decisions on the above-mentioned area and to implement this plan. The Japanese government believes that under these circumstances, the above-mentioned recommendations will be received. After receiving this reply, Briand replied that the presence of unexpected foreign observers on the Administrative Council would be very beneficial to the establishment of a neutral zone, the prevention of conflicts between the two sides, and the maintenance of peace in Jinzhou. The British representative of the Administrative Council today submitted to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations a report from a British officer who recently inspected Qiqihar. The officer left Qiqihar on November 24. At that time, Heilongjiang was entirely under the jurisdiction of the Japanese. The Kuomintang headquarters and the telegraph bureau were occupied by the civil administration, and private residences were inspected to search for weapons, but there was no looting or rape. The occupation of Heilongjiang was carried out in an orderly manner. When this article was written, all Chinese administrative agencies were not working. Except for a diplomatic officer, a deputy police chief, and one-third of the original police force staying in the provincial capital, the senior officials all fled. The Japanese did not interfere with the deputy police chief, but the police force was not large enough to be fully responsible for the entire city. The police chief is now working with the Chamber of Commerce to organize a provincial committee to maintain public security. It is said that many Japanese expatriates have returned, and Japanese planes fly out every day to scout, but it has not been heard that the Japanese army has moved north again. The Japanese army in Qiqihar suffered unusually high deaths due to the rapid advance and the cold weather. Three hundred and fifty people have lost their combat power due to frostbite. The Chinese Eastern Railway line has not been interfered with, and there are no Japanese troops in the railway area. Among the documents published by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations today, there is a cable from Dr. Shih to the Nanjing government stating that the Japanese army continued to advance towards Jinzhou. At 1:00 AM on the 28th, 100 Japanese cavalrymen were found north of Lijiapowo, and 100 infantrymen were found south, supplemented by artillery. Their objective seemed to be Dagushan. The Chinese army had retreated to Baicheng. Today, the Japanese representative informed the Secretary-General of the general situation of the activities of Chinese soldiers and bandits between Xinmin and Dunhua from November 19 to 25. The Nanjing Japanese Embassy's protest to the Chinese government regarding the Tianjin affairs on November 26 and 28 was also published today. The French representative of the Administrative Council today submitted the report of the French inspector in Jinzhou to the Secretary-General. This report does not note the date, and was probably prepared before Briand's letter requesting the establishment of a neutral zone. It said that the Japanese army was advancing towards Jinzhou, but Jinzhou had not been fortified for defense, and it was urgent to establish a neutral zone. The order in Jinzhou was still good. The Chinese representative read out several documents, one of which was a telegram from a Jinzhou correspondent for the Shanghai Evening News proving that the Chinese had not made offensive preparations, and one of which mentioned that Japanese in Manchuria falsely claimed land owned by Chinese, and a Reuters telegram from Shenyang reported that Japanese soldiers in Huanggu Tun shot and killed two Chinese. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) During the meeting of the Drafting Committee, Dr. Shih discussed with the members how to strengthen the promise made by Japan not to attack Jinzhou, which China intended to accept. It is reported that Dr. Shih wanted to obtain international support, but at present the Japanese representative is directly communicating with Zhang Xueliang in Beiping, and at the same time the Japanese ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi is meeting with Foreign Minister Koo in Nanjing, so perhaps a solution can be negotiated outside the League of Nations.

<p>The US Government Hopes for Direct Negotiations Between China and Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) Japan has withdrawn the statement issued by the Foreign Ministry attacking Stimson. US officials today expressed their satisfaction. The Japanese government now believes that the matter has been concluded. Since the US government has not made a formal statement, it is expected that there has been an understanding. (National News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Responsible parties here stated today that the US government is convinced that the solution to the American problems depends on direct negotiations between China and Japan. It is reported that the State Department is very pleased to see that the situation in Manchuria has gradually become milder after the actions of both China and Japan have eased. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador Debuchi visited Secretary of State Stimson at the State Department today. The nature of the talks has not been disclosed. Only Debuchi told reporters when leaving the State Department that Japanese troops would not advance to Jinzhou. As for the accident between Stimson and Shidehara, Debuchi refused to discuss it. According to news here, the Japanese government has accepted Stimson's denial, so the matter has been concluded. As for the events in the three eastern provinces here, the anxiety has been relieved as the situation has eased. At present, we are eagerly awaiting the results of the council's discussion.

<h3 id="e4">After the Security Forces Withdraw <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Anxiety in Tianjin Remains Unabated</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Still Open Fire, Provoke</p>
<p>Break into Chinese Territory, Search for Security Forces</p>
<p>Foreign Reporters Nearly Hit by Stray Bullets</p>
<p>(Tianjin) From 7:30 AM to 4:30 PM on the 30th, martial law was lifted in the Chinese district. Although shops were ordered to resume business, they were only half-open and there was no trade. The order in the market was still chaotic. Most of the shopkeepers were still moving to the concessions, and a few moved back to the Chinese district. Because the security forces withdrew from Hebei, the people felt even more uneasy. The tram company sent workers to repair the power lines destroyed by the Japanese army's artillery fire. It is hoped that some of the trams will be restored in one day. News came from the Japanese concession that the Japanese army had long been determined to occupy Tianjin. They used the civilian clothes team to reduce the losses of the Japanese army. The person who took the power was Lin Kuanzhong, the special agent of the Gendarmerie Department, with Li Jichun and Zhang Bi as puppets. During the first riot, we retreated 300 meters. During the second riot, the Japanese army claimed that the Japanese army decided to occupy Tianjin on the night of the 28th. We retreated another 600 meters. The Japanese plan failed again and they were still unwilling to give up. They planned to instigate the civilian clothes team to make a big disturbance once within a week. Considering that the defenses of the Japanese concession have not been withdrawn and the alert is still strict, it is not comparable to rumors. The Japanese marines wear blue uniforms. After arriving in Tianjin, they changed to yellow uniforms. After 10 o'clock in the evening, the lights south of Miyajima Street were fully lit, while the north was still dark and terrifying. All the defensive materials in the Chinese district were dismantled on the 30th. The police on duty carried sticks instead of guns. On the evening of the 29th, the municipal government received a report that a batch of marines had boarded ships in Tanggu and went to Tianjin. The municipal government immediately questioned the Japanese consul, saying that we had repeatedly made concessions. Why are you still increasing troops? The Japanese consul said that the movement of troops was a normal matter and asked not to obstruct it. The merchants and residents in the Japanese district were evacuated. The Japanese soldiers lacked food. On the 30th, they sent personnel to buy a large amount of rice and flour. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Two Japanese soldiers disguised themselves as Chinese on the 30th and went to Hebei to investigate whether the security forces had retreated to Hebei. The police saw that their behavior was suspicious and wanted to interrogate them. The Japanese soldiers opened fire immediately. After it was identified that they were Japanese, they were allowed to escape. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) News came from the Japanese concession that the Japanese Residents Association sent representatives to see Kashi on the 27th, requesting that a division of troops be sent to Tianjin to protect the overseas Chinese. If the military strength is strong, it may be possible to occupy Tianjin, otherwise the Japanese expatriates will withdraw and board the destroyer to return to their country. Kashi then decided to attack Tianjin on the 28th. Because we made concessions, the trick did not succeed. The representative of the Residents Association saw Kashi again on the morning of the 30th, accusing him of being weak towards China. Kashi was active again. Japanese Consul Kuwashima heard the news and visited Kashi with the Police Chief Shinsaka in the afternoon, telling him that Tianjin was different from the Northeast, and that occupying Tianjin would be unprofitable and harmful to Japan. Kashi's attitude then softened again. At 1:00 PM on the 30th, Japanese soldiers killed a rickshaw puller in Paotaizhuang. The 3rd squadron of the Japanese army, consisting of 750 soldiers, arrived in Tianjin at 6:00 AM on the 1st. The municipal government sent a letter to the Japanese consul on the evening of the 30th, requesting that the increase in troops be stopped to avoid panic among the people of Tianjin and provoke incidents. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The municipal government sent a letter to Japanese Consul General Kuwashima, saying that at 6:00 AM on the 30th of this month, a rickshaw puller was shot and killed by Japanese troops from the direction of Lotte Building in the open space south of Huaiqingli. At 2:25 PM, seven Japanese soldiers came to the Dunhouli area of Ningjiada Bridge and fired a shot. At 2:50 PM, three Japanese soldiers in Tianjili, Paotaizhuang, carried guns for inspection. In order to avoid misunderstandings, we had consulted with the Japanese military department and then automatically withdrew the security forces. Unexpectedly, after the security forces of your country had withdrawn, the soldiers of your country came to provoke, which is likely to cause misunderstandings. We hereby send a letter to your consul general for investigation and ask you to inform the military department of your country to stop it quickly so as to avoid misunderstandings, and hope to see a reply. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The municipal government hosted foreign reporters in the afternoon of the 30th and visited the situation in the Chinese district where the Japanese soldiers bombed. When walking near the Mei-I-Mei Church, Japanese soldiers suddenly fired several shots from inside a civilian house. The bullets flew over their heads, and the reporters retreated in fright. Japanese soldiers were seen appearing and disappearing in the Fushunzhuang area, occupying buildings. The defensive materials on the street have not been withdrawn. At 1:00 PM, eight Japanese soldiers, each carrying a pistol, went to the area south of Ningjiada Bridge and under Nantou and searched for the security forces from house to house. They were extremely fierce. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to responsible Chinese sources, 300 Japanese sailors and three infantry squadrons (approximately 750 people), carrying field artillery and machine guns, arrived in Tanggu at 6:00 PM tonight. They will be able to arrive at Tianjin port by tide at 6:00 AM tomorrow. Today it is very quiet here, but the residents in the Chinese districts are still moving into the concessions one after another. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Harbin) Ma Zhanshan appointed Xu Baozhen, the head of the Guard Corps, as the commander of the garrison, and Hailun implemented martial law. The streets are quiet at 8:00 PM. The two provincial military offices are located in Guangxin Oil Shop. The agencies are located in various commercial firms. Liu Tingxuan, Ma Jinggui, Pan Jingwu, and Zheng Lingao arrived at the Provincial Committee. Wu Huanzhang and Wang Binqing arrived at the Party Committee. Most of the staff of the agencies arrived. The military and political locations are being actively organized. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) One battalion of the newly recruited railway protection army stationed in Dunhua and Jilin mutinied on the 28th and defected to Ma Zhanshan. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Ma Zhanshan told reporters that the reasons for this defeat were: (1) Sanjianfang had no terrain, no important position, and was difficult to defend; (2) The trenches were built on sandy land and were easily destroyed by artillery fire; (3) The cavalry could not fight as a whole; (4) There was no support or supply. In the future, we will focus on training.</p>

<h3 id="e6">New Crisis Under Confusing Circumstances <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The recent developments in the Northeast issue, as well as international attitudes, have suddenly become confusing and bewildering. In Japan, rumors are spreading about the renewal of the Tianjin incident and simultaneous uprisings plotted by Japanese in various ports along the river. Troops are pressing toward Jinzhou, and at one point, reinforcements were sent. On the other hand, part of the Japanese army suddenly withdrew within the South Manchuria Railway (SMR) zone. Both Shidehara and the Minister of War and the General Staff expressed that they would not take hostile actions against Jinzhou. Internationally, the League of Nations is everywhere yielding to Japan and complying with its demands, while U.S. Secretary of State Stimson has again issued remarks expressing dissatisfaction with Japan. British public opinion towards Japan is also becoming increasingly intense. In our country, there is much talk domestically about recovering lost territory, while Shi Zhaoji, our representative at the League of Nations, is showing signs of compromising on resolutions. Based on these phenomena, the situations on all sides are extremely contradictory and vague, making us feel as if we are lost in a fog, unable to grasp the true reality of the current situation.</p>
<p>However, it is precisely because the current situations on all sides are confusing and bewildering, making it impossible for us to grasp, that it is necessary for our people to pay close attention to this phenomenon. We believe that the current confusing situation has proven that our country has entered a new and serious period. The persecution by the Japanese in the past has now turned into diplomatic pressure. The encroachment by Japan alone in the past has now turned into a collective effort by various countries to plot against us. The enthusiasm and determination of our country in upholding justice, protecting our national territory, and restraining violence has now gradually diminished. If this conjecture, unfortunately, proves to be correct, then we dare to assert that "the northeastern half of our country will forever change its appearance from now on, with no hope of recovery."</p>
<p>We believe that the reason why a part of the Japanese army suddenly withdrew to within the SMR zone is, on the one hand, to ease the international situation, and on the other hand, to alleviate the resentment of our people. They are retreating to advance, defending to attack, deliberately withdrawing a very small part of their troops to divert the world's attention and achieve their ambition of permanently occupying our Northeast. The reason why the League of Nations does not hesitate to bow down and wholeheartedly suppress us and favor Japan is to establish an extremely ridiculous so-called neutral zone within our territory, to prevent the Japanese army from attacking Jinzhou, in order to maintain its faint existence. It can also use this as an excuse to adjourn the meeting, allowing our country and Japan to negotiate directly. As for the sudden expression of severe intervention by the United States and Britain when the Japanese army pressed westward towards Jinzhou the other day, it was because the area west of Jinzhou was not within the sphere of influence of the Japanese, and the Japanese did not know when to stop, and wanted to advance westward, encroaching on the sphere of influence of other countries. Therefore, Britain and the United States had to use a strong attitude to restrain their excessive expansion of power. This fact is extremely clear. Therefore, the criticism of Japan by Britain and the United States is not out of love for us, but rather a concrete manifestation of their attempt to divide China and seize a piece each. Our people should not feel relieved by the withdrawal of the Japanese army and the assistance of Britain and the United States. It must be known that the lost territory in the Northeast has not yet been recovered. The Japanese army within the SMR zone can still launch an attack at any time. Britain and the United States are by no means sincerely helping us. The day when the League of Nations adjourns will be the time when our country and Japan will directly negotiate. There will be many difficulties in the future, and we must not have any slackness or relief.</p>
<p>Our authorities must never show fear of trouble and retreat before the Northeast is recovered, nor should they make any compromises, lest our Northeast fall into a state of irrecoverable destruction. For at this time, our country has reached a new and serious period. Our people must pay attention to this. Our government must respect public opinion, uphold justice, and fight to the end to protect the life of the nation.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Received</p>
<p>Cavalry always aims to defeat the many with the few, not defending strongholds nor attacking hard targets, making the most of its plains combat capabilities. The Provincial Government will not necessarily be located in any fixed place, and it will be determined based on the situation whether to move. The time for a counterattack cannot be predetermined either; it will be launched when the opportunity arises. Even with eyes closed, we can find our way freely in the eastern part of Heilongjiang. Even if the enemy approaches with a hundred or a thousand times our strength, I will not flinch. I am confident that I have the backbone of a man and vow to fight to the end, never becoming a slave of a conquered nation. I have no objection to Fourth Master Zhang taking charge of the administration in Heilongjiang, but if there is even one Japanese person in the provincial capital, I will treat him as an enemy. He may be willing to surrender to Japan, but I cannot betray my responsibility to defend the territory and accept the rule of a conquered nation. According to Fourth Master Zhang, namely Zhang Jinghui (5), future plans are to deploy three lines of defense along the Qiqihar-Keshan line, but adopting mobile cavalry tactics, not sticking to rigid defense, and advancing whenever there is an opportunity. Defense corps will be established in each county, with a lieutenant colonel assigned to every three counties. Each battalion will have four company commanders, and each battalion will consist of five hundred men, all organized as cavalry. They must be formed by December 15th, and I will personally inspect them. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a dispatch from Shenyang, the Japanese military headquarters has heard that General Ma Zhanshan is currently leading troops from Hailun towards Qiqihar,</p>
<p>ready to be mobilized upon orders. If necessary, reinforcements will be sent from Shenyang to Heihe. Further dispatch: The Japanese military headquarters dispatched the main force of a brigade to Qiqihar tonight to prevent Ma's army from counterattacking. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan is currently in Hailun, occasionally visiting Keshan, Bairun, and other places, observing the battle situation. His troops are now concentrated, and reinforcements are arriving continuously. There are about 1,700 Japanese troops in Heilongjiang, and due to fear of the cold, they have shown signs of retreat. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to people from Bu Kui (Qiqihar), Ma Zhanshan withdrew from Jiangqiao on the 18th, and Heilongjiang fell into a state of anarchy. On the 19th, part of the Japanese army entered the city, the military headquarters, and conducted strict searches of the residences of various important figures. Before leaving Heilongjiang, Ma published a letter to the elders and fathers of Heilongjiang, stating that although he had withdrawn from the provincial capital, he was determined to continue fighting the Japanese to the end with his previous spirit. Ma was stationed in Hailun. On the 23rd, the Japanese army attacked Tai'an and came into contact with our Wu and Fan clans. Ma Qing personally supervised the battle, and about 700 Japanese soldiers were killed in the Huai Shu Gou area. Dōmon, the commander of the Japanese army, sent someone to contact the chamber of commerce, ordering them to make 300 coffins within three days to transport the Japanese soldiers back to the province. The public security of the provincial capital is maintained by the police. The Japanese army, due to the severe cold in Heilongjiang, has no intention of garrisoning for a long time and is preparing to withdraw to southern Manchuria. (30th Dispatch)</p>

At the same time, the maintenance association established by Heilongjiang gentry and merchants will be abolished. The security team sent by Zhang Jinghui to Heilongjiang was refused armed passage on the Eastern Railway, so one company marched unarmed on the 28th, with weapons transported separately. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Zhao Zhongren telegraphed Ma Zhanshan, asking him to hand over the seal of Heilongjiang Province to Zhang Jinghui. Ma replied that the seal was received from the Central Government, and the transfer must have an order from the Central Government. Now, Zhao has come to Harbin and is making several telephone calls to Hailun every day, intimidating Ma. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Harbin) A reporter went to Hailun on the 27th to investigate and has now returned to Harbin. The current situation of the Heilongjiang army is as follows: The First Brigade, Wan Chonggu's unit, suffered the heaviest casualties. The three regiments now have a strength of three thousand men. Of the nine cannons, three remain. The Eighth Cavalry Brigade, Cheng Zhiyuan's unit, now has a strength of four thousand men. Wu Songshan's brigade now has a strength of three thousand men. The Fourth Regiment of the Guard Regiment, the Third Regiment of Zhang's brigade, the First Regiment of the Third Brigade, the Fifth Regiment, the newly formed replenishment regiment, etc., all have a strength of over a thousand men. Because the gathering points for each brigade and regiment were not in one place during the retreat, it will take some time to gather them, and reorganization will also take a considerable amount of time. The artillery suffered particularly heavy losses, and there is a shortage of funds for replenishment. (30th Dispatch)</p>

They are awaiting instructions from the United States before they can proceed with consultations. According to the opinion of one military attaché, the demarcation of zones must use rivers and mountains as the standard. British Counselor Stuart Bodman went to Panshan for inspection on the afternoon of the 29th and is scheduled to return to Jinzhou on the 30th. US Counselor Ord went to the Daling River for inspection. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Troops on Beining Line Withdraw in Three Sections</p>
<p>Passenger Train Only Reached Dahushan Yesterday</p>
<p>(Beiping) A dispatch from Jinzhou states that the situation east of Jinzhou has eased. The Japanese army removed the obstacles from the Raoyang River railway bridge. The armored vehicles of the Japanese army at Lijia Wopu and the infantry, cavalry, and artillery around the Raoyang River withdrew eastward in three sections. The first section withdrew from Raoyang River to Baiqibao at 11 PM on the 28th. The second section withdrew from Lijia Wopu to Raoyang River at 8 AM on the 29th. In the last section, there are no Japanese troops from Lijia Wopu to Xinmin. Japanese planes flew low over Jinzhou and the Daling River at noon on the 29th for reconnaissance. Our armored vehicles are still stationed at Lijia Wopu. All telephone and telegraph lines along the way that were damaged by the Japanese army are now being repaired urgently, as evidence of Japanese provocation against us. However, the sections of the Beining Railway that were bombed by the Japanese army have not yet been repaired. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army is withdrawing from Xinmin and Juliuhe. There is still a small part of the Japanese army west of Dahushan. The passenger train traveling east on the Beining Line on the 30th only reached Dahushan. Residents of various stations have been flocking to Shanhaiguan to escape, and about 140 people have come to Beiping for refuge today. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese soldiers are reinforcing Yingkou again. On the 29th, they conducted a large artillery exercise in the area. There are no Japanese soldiers in Panshan and Dawa. A Japanese plane flew to Dahushan at 11 AM for reconnaissance. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Japanese troops are successively withdrawing to the east bank of the Liao River and will soon be completely withdrawn, while Chinese troops are gradually advancing to occupy the land vacated by the Japanese troops. This is being carried out according to procedure. However, the Japanese claim that the Chinese troops are gathering in excessive numbers. An article was recently published by Japanese officials stating that aircraft inspections revealed that between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM yesterday, there were seven trains seemingly fully loaded with Chinese troops traveling from Jinzhou to Dahushan, and there were still 1,300 infantrymen, 1,000 cavalrymen, and over 50 artillery pieces stationed near Dahushan. When reporters inquired about the Japanese army headquarters' opinion on this, a spokesperson said that if there were no provocative acts, the Japanese army did not want to attack the Chinese troops there. When reporters inquired whether the current movements of the Chinese troops would be considered provocative by the Japanese army, the spokesperson replied that it had not yet been determined. Foreign staff members of the Beining Railway declared that the Beining Railway could resume traffic tomorrow. Judging from this, the road is now peaceful, which can be imagined. The Japanese army headquarters has now allowed a train to be test-run today to inspect the route and repair telephone and telegraph communications. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jinzhou telegram: The "Zhongshan" armored vehicle carried road bureau technicians from Dahushan at 1:00 AM on the 30th to repair the power lines east of Tangjiawopu and returned to Dahushan at 5:00 AM to report that there were no Japanese troops from Xinmin to Tangjiawopu. The Japanese troops at Juliuhe have not withdrawn. The rumor that Xiaobailong occupied Xinmin is not accurate, but he is actively recruiting followers. Due to a shortage of firearms, most are organized as broadsword teams. At 8:30 AM, another train departed from Dahushan to Xinmin to continue repairing the power lines. Counselors from various embassies went to Beipiao at 9:00 AM to inspect. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Gu Weijun Assumes Office Yesterday</p>
<p>Lin Sen Represents the Central Government to Administer the Oath</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Has a Personally Written Admonition</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The newly appointed Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Gu Weijun, held an oath-taking ceremony at the National Government Auditorium at 10:30 AM on the 30th. Lin Sen was appointed by the Central Government to administer the oath. After the ceremony, Chairman Chiang presented the seal, Gu received the seal, then Gu raised his right hand and read the oath. Lin Sen administered the oath. After the oath, Lin gave a speech, stating that at this time of national crisis and diplomatic urgency, the Central Government paid very close attention to the selection of diplomatic personnel. Everyone knew that Shaochuan (Gu Weijun) had a wealth of diplomatic talent and experience, so this great responsibility</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>was entrusted to him. This was not only considered satisfactory, but the Central Committee members were also very pleased. With regard to diplomatic tasks, we should, in principle, deal with foreign countries in a revolutionary spirit based on the teachings of the Premier, but internally, we should pay attention to the reorganization and training of the ministry's affairs. Recently, I had the opportunity to travel and visit overseas, where China has sent embassies and consulates, and I also carefully examined the service of the staff of the embassies and consulates. I noticed one thing that was quite inappropriate, namely that many of the staff of the embassies and consulates were young people under the age of thirty. It is of course gratifying to see young people with potential, and although there are young people in the diplomatic circles of foreign countries, it is not as widespread as this. Although many young people have vigor, some take the opportunity to study abroad, which is good, but it is not as good as completing training in China before being dispatched abroad to serve wholeheartedly, so that both knowledge and experience are sufficient. After working hours, if there is any remaining strength, further research can be conducted concurrently, which is not mutually exclusive. This is what is hoped for those who are reorganizing the ministry. Secondly, during this inspection of various places, overseas Chinese strongly hope that those who send embassy and consulate personnel must be familiar with the Party's doctrines, so that they can effectively cooperate with the local Party branches at all levels. Now, when the country is in distress and there are many difficulties in diplomatic affairs, but if we can act in accordance with the Premier's instructions, we will surely achieve the final victory. When the Premier was dying in Beijing, he said, "Peaceful struggle to save China," and if we use these words to negotiate with various countries, then the final victory will naturally be achieved. Finally, I wish Shaochuan good health and progress. Then Chiang's speech was delivered, followed by Gu's reply, and the event was adjourned. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Acting Foreign Minister Gu Weijun took office on the morning of the 30th after the National Government's memorial week. Chairman Chiang personally wrote a speech, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>War is not limited to tangible military affairs. The wars of agriculture, industry, commerce, science, and economics are more effective than military force, and the value of the intangible wars in diplomacy is greater than that of any other war, but the world does not know this. In military warfare, there are those who defend by attacking, those who retreat by advancing, and those who defend by attacking and retreat by advancing. The wonder of its ingenious and realistic use depends on the one mind of the commander-in-chief. The efforts of diplomatic negotiations, the distance of its efforts, and the magnitude of its effects are far greater than those of military affairs by a hundred or a thousand times. This also depends on the specialization of the appointment and the doubling of the trust, so that the diplomatic authorities can be responsible for courageously advancing in order to save the final victory. It is a pity that the world only sees tangible warfare as warfare, and does not know that intangible warfare is more than tangible warfare. They only see the current war as war, and do not know that today's war was already started invisibly decades ago, but it was only discovered today, and the number of its victories and defeats had already been determined. In these decades of intangible warfare, it has not started from today. However, although the number of past victories and defeats has already been determined, the victories and defeats of future wars can be determined today. As the saying goes, "If you lose in the east, you can make it up in the west. It is not too late to mend the fold after losing the sheep." Now Minister Gu is taking office in the autumn of crisis and is ordered at the intersection of survival and death. I am deeply convinced that he will surely shoulder the arduous task and not disgrace his mission. However, military affairs lie in the specialization of trust, so outside the tent, the general is in charge. Diplomatic relations are more important than military affairs, especially in the specialization of trust. To resist foreign aggression, we must first settle the internal affairs. Only unification can resist insult. There has never been a country that has not been unified and can win abroad. Therefore, today's foreign affairs, whether resolved by military means or by diplomatic means, will not be successful without first seeking domestic unity. To advocate war, we must first seek domestic unity. Even to advocate peace, we must also seek domestic unity, otherwise we cannot talk about peace. Therefore, if we cannot fight, we cannot talk about peace, and if we are not unified, we cannot talk about peace or war.</p>
<p>When our country is facing internal and external troubles, the authorities in military and diplomatic affairs can only rely on a sincere patriotic zeal, exhaust their loyalty and fulfill their responsibilities. As for success or failure, profit or loss, they cannot foresee it. Praise or blame, honor or disgrace, are not what they care about. The government and the people must have specialized trust, unite together, and serve as the country's backing, without seeking quick success in the moment, but planning for effectiveness in the future. The Premier said, "If we control it, we will survive; if others control it, we will perish." This is the Premier's unchanging legacy of diplomatic policy. The diplomatic policy of the Special Diplomatic Committee is the only appropriate policy for today. Minister Gu should deeply understand this meaning, be mindful of the legacy, display his ambitions, and give full play to his talents, so that our country's diplomacy can turn defeat into victory and turn danger into safety, so as not to fail the government and the people's eager expectations. Chiang Kai-shek, November 30, 20th year. (30th Dispatch)</p>

First, Vice Minister Li Jinlun delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of all the staff. After the speech, Gu gave a speech, stating that he had not been involved in politics for two years. Now, due to the current national crisis, he had repeatedly received telegrams from the Central Party and government authorities and Chairman Chiang, summoning him to Beijing to participate in the Special Diplomatic Committee. Later, he was ordered to act as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and had repeatedly declined, but his request was not approved. Soon after, the appointment was changed to a clearly signed order for him to take office immediately. In the future, he hoped that everyone would assist him with the same spirit that they had assisted Minister Wang and Minister Li over the past few years. If there were any opinions, they could be raised at any time for research. He would take full responsibility for matters and had no problems with people. However, he hoped that Minister Shi would complete the affairs of the League of Nations as soon as possible and come to Beijing to take office, so that he could be relieved of his responsibilities as soon as possible.

After a long period of investigation, it was finally found that its manufacturing facility was in Basel, and distribution facilities were set up all over the world.

<p>Tianjin Under Cannon Attack</p>
<p>Japanese Army Fires Cannon Shells Used by Bandits</p>
<p>Japanese Marines and Firearms Arrive in Tianjin Successively</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the night of the 26th, under the cover of the Japanese army, plainclothes teams re-enacted the second riot in places like Ningjia Bridge and Wandezhuang. The Japanese have now torn off their mask of hypocrisy and openly and fiercely bombard the Chinese-controlled areas with constant artillery fire, desperately seeking provocations and hoping to create a direct conflict between China and Japan in order to realize a chaotic situation. The dispatch of the plainclothes teams was mixed with and guided by the Japanese, and their momentum was fiercer than last time, and the artillery fire was also denser than last time. Fortunately, our side's defenses were very strict, and the bandits were still unable to break through. The original plan of the Japanese side was to use deceptive means to make our side withdraw all defensive works, and then use a blitzkrieg method to seize Tianjin and cut off the Beining Railway line, so that Jinzhou and other places could be settled without bloodshed. Now that this kind of cunning plan has failed, it has taken a sharp turn for the worse. As early as 10:00 am yesterday (the 27th), unreasonable demands were made, using this as an excuse to take hostile actions. In addition to refuting the claims based on reason, the authorities have also made various preparations. The following records the situation yesterday:</p>
<p>Japanese Army Bombards Day and Night After the second riot on the night of the 26th, the Japanese military camp at Haiguang Temple and various places in the Japanese Concession continued to fire guns and cannons at us. The sounds temporarily stopped after 3:00 am yesterday (the 27th), but by 7:00 am, the tension suddenly reappeared, and the sound of artillery was loud. The artillery shells were all fired from the Japanese military camp at Haiguang Temple, covering the plainclothes teams in Ningjia Bridge, Huaiqingli, and Paotaizhuang Xiaotili, attacking our defensive sections. The momentum was fierce, but after a head-on attack by the security team, many were killed on the spot, and several were captured. The rioters retreated to their starting point, and then the situation calmed down, but the sound of gunfire was still intermittent. Until 2:00 pm, the Japanese military camp fired more than 40 artillery shells, falling within our territory. Among them, there were ten 10-cm semi-diameter, 40-cm long cannon shells, and 7-cm semi-diameter mountain cannons and field cannons. Although some of them exploded, they did not hit any vital points. At the same time, the Japanese army also appeared on Rongye Street, carrying machine guns to nearby locations of our defense area and advancing towards the southeast corner of the city, intending to challenge. Because our security team maintained calmness and ignored them, they hesitated and retreated, still firing guns and shooting at our side from time to time. Plainclothes teams lurking in Xiaotili and Huaiqingli launched two sudden attacks on our side, but were bravely repelled by the security team. The bandits suffered many casualties. Five of our police officers, Li Lianfu, Zhang Qinxue, Sun Xiuyan, Wang Zizhou, and Wu Zhumi, were injured, and about seven or eight were killed in action. Section Chief Tian, who was originally stationed in the Sixth Section of the First District, personally led the police officers to fight against the plainclothes teams, and was never broken into. Now, because the situation in that section is dangerously pressing, it has been moved to the Qinyunlou Security 17th Team's stationed location in the South City at 6:00 am this morning, as a temporary office location. During the fierce battle the previous night, at about 10:00 pm, the Japanese army secretly transported more than 50 plainclothes teams by small boats along the riverbank of the Zhaikou, hoping to attack the Second Special District. After being discovered by the police officers, they opened fire to intercept them. The bandits lost their footing and fell into the water one after another, and many drowned. There were still plainclothes teams appearing in Zhaikou and Paotai, and fierce battles continued to occur. All were bravely repelled by the police officers, and were unable to break through the defense line. The Fifth Company of the Second Brigade and the Twentieth Company of the Third Brigade of the Security Team were all injured, but the number of people was not large. Until about 2:00 am this morning (the 28th), plainclothes teams gathered again on Zhaikou Road, Rongye Street Road, and Haiguang Temple Road, one way towards Ningjia Bridge, and one way towards Nanguan Street, and launched a large-scale attack on our defense line at the same time. The Japanese side fired artillery to cover them, intending to use the power of the artillery fire and the momentum of the concerted action to make our side unable to take care of both ends, and break through one or two defense lines. So for a time, the sound of guns and cannons was loud, and the momentum was quite fierce. However, the security team resisted bravely, and the plainclothes teams from all directions were unsuccessful and were all repelled. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, it entered a state of standstill. After 3:00 am, the sound of guns and cannons became sparse again, but there were still faint sounds, and there were no other changes.</p>
<p>Unreasonable Demands from the Japanese Side Commander Kashi Haohei of the Japanese Army stationed in Tianjin presented five demands to Wang Shuchang, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, at 10:30 am yesterday (the 27th), asking for a reply by noon on the same day. The translated text reads, "To His Excellency Wang Shuchang, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government and Commander of the Second Army: On November 15th, Your Excellency expressed your apologies for the hostile actions of the Chinese side. However, yesterday, the 26th, your country's army and security team suddenly fired at the Japanese army and the Japanese Concession, and this has not been stopped until the 27th. This clearly shows that you have no sincerity in acknowledging hostile actions against the Japanese army. Now, in order to maintain peace between China and Japan, the Commander of the Japanese Army hereby demands the following items from Your Excellency, to be implemented by noon on the 27th, and hopes for a reply: (1) Immediately cease hostile acts; (2) The Chinese army must withdraw 20 li from the garrisons of all countries; (3) The armed security team must withdraw from the Nanyun River and Jingang Bridge, passing through the Qiangzi River, to the north of the Yun River; (4) The army in Hebei Province (whether armed or in plainclothes) must cease moving; (5) Absolutely prohibit anti-Japanese and insulting Japanese behavior."</p>
<p>Our Side's Stern Refutation After receiving the above demands from the Japanese side, Chairman Wang of the Provincial Government immediately notified the Japanese military commander that it was still necessary to translate, so he verbally agreed to reply before 6:00 pm yesterday (the 27th). At 4:00 pm, he sent a letter to Kashi, stating that the Commander's note of the 27th of this month had been translated and understood, and now replied in accordance with the original items, etc. The general idea of ​​the reply is as follows: (1) Currently, our side is defending against plainclothes teams, and there is absolutely no hostile behavior towards your side. After repeated statements, I hope you can understand. Our two sides have always maintained good relations, and I especially hope that we can work together to prevent similar hostile actions in the future; (2) In order to respect the intention of the exchange of notes on the Tianjin Treaty of 1902, our side has withdrawn a small number of Chinese troops temporarily stationed in Tianjin to a location 20 li outside Tianjin, and has already replied to your country's consul general on file; (3) The Tianjin Municipal Security Team has the responsibility to protect the public security of Tianjin. Now that there are plainclothes teams causing trouble, if the security team is withdrawn in accordance with the letter, the lives and property of Chinese and foreign people in the withdrawn area will inevitably be impossible to protect. It is really difficult to withdraw suddenly. I hope your side can understand this fact, but if we can jointly find effective methods to protect public security with the authorities of other friendly countries stationed in Tianjin, this article can also be discussed and handled; (4) The Chinese troops currently stationed within 20 li of Tianjin have already been withdrawn as mentioned above. As for other troops, there is no movement towards Tianjin; (5) Anti-Japanese and insulting behavior has been prohibited for a long time, and we should pay more attention to it in the future.</p>
<p>Damage Situation on Our Side Yesterday afternoon (the 27th), the consuls of the United States and Belgium stationed in Tianjin, accompanied by a military attache from the American military camp, went to Dongfu Bridge, Dongmalu Southeast Corner, Nanguan Xiatou, etc., accompanied by Zhang Guanru, Secretary of the Municipal Government, to conduct on-the-spot investigations. Upon returning, they stated that there were two types of artillery shells found in the Chinese territory, one was a 12-cm over-mountain cannon, and the other was a 75-cm shrapnel. There was also the most powerful bomb, as big as a dustpan. The American military officer said that this bomb explodes in mid-air, and when it lands, it can explode a very large area. American robbers often use it. It is inhumane to fire such artillery shells, so it is prohibited for use in foreign countries, especially in urban areas. A total of more than 30 artillery shells were fired on the night of the 26th, and more than 10 fell around the Provincial Government and in the river. The large glass window of the front building of the Provincial Government was shattered by the explosion. One shell fell on the Huangweilu Municipal Slaughterhouse, exploding on a tree, scraping the corner of the wall, and there was not much damage. One shell fell in front of the Public Security Bureau. The most tragic thing was that a 12-cm over-mountain cannon shell fell on Dongmalu, killing two policemen and injuring five others. When they arrived at Nanguan Xiatou, the plainclothes teams were still firing at the security team from the roof of the Methodist Church. The south end of the main street in that area was the Japanese defense line, and the north end was the security team's defense line. On the evening of the 26th, dozens of plainclothes teams suddenly rushed out from within the Japanese defense line and advanced to only a dozen paces away from the security team. The security team immediately opened machine gun fire to sweep them, and the plainclothes teams retreated one after another. At that time, the Japanese army within the Japanese defense line suddenly fired at the security team. The first shot was too close, the second shot was too far, and the third shot landed on the security team's defense line, blasting a circular hole in the sandbag. One security team member was killed on the spot, and two were injured. The situation was extremely tragic. About five or six artillery shells landed near the defense line of the Fifth Company of the Second Brigade of the Zhaikou Security Team. Although there were no inscriptions on the artillery shells, the shell casings all had the words "Taisho 15th Year" on them, proving that they were issued to the plainclothes teams by the Japanese. In this battle, five policemen were killed and more than ten were injured, all of which were eyewitnessed facts.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of the Diplomatic Corps After the consuls and military attachés were guided by personnel from the Municipal Government to inspect yesterday (the 27th), they all believed that the Japanese army's shelling of the Chinese-controlled areas was destructive and inhumane. It has been decided to hold an emergency meeting at 9:00 am today (the 28th) to discuss ways to provide relief to the city and maintain public security, and they greatly disapprove of the five demands made by Japanese Commander Kashi. The current situation is clearly that the Japanese side is making unreasonable demands, and the issue of demanding that China withdraw the security team is not something that the Japanese side should raise.</p>
<p>Japanese Marines Arrive in Tianjin The two Japanese ships, "Fuyong" and "Asagao", which were docked in Tanggu, were divided into batches, carrying about 200 marines. One batch of 90 men, carrying two machine guns and four portable ones, as well as several boxes of ammunition, set off for Tianjin yesterday (the 27th), passing through Gegu at 6:00 pm. After another batch arrived in Tianjin, they landed at Dalian Wharf. The Japanese Command dispatched eight heavy-duty vehicles to transport about a hundred Japanese soldiers to Haiguang Temple. When the Japanese soldiers landed, the wharf was under martial law, and four machine guns were installed to cover the landing. According to foreign news, the Japanese army's "Henan Maru", which was sailing from Dalian to Tianjin, was loaded with 500 pistols, 20 small steel cannons, 30 machine guns, and 200 boxes of gun ammunition, specifically for the purpose of using rioters to disrupt the rear. Also, Japanese Commander Kashi telegraphed Shenyang to request four aircraft to be flown from the air to Tianjin to prepare for disrupting the area.</p>
<p>Wartime State in the Japanese Concession After the incident broke out again on the evening of the 26th, the Japanese Concession's defenses became stricter again. Earlier, most of the defensive works in the Concession had not been removed, so they were strictly repaired again. The various barriers were raised separately and covered with steel plates. Sandbags were piled up around the roofs and spires of companies such as Zhongyuan Company and Lao Jiuzhang, and gun positions and machine guns were set up. Defensive works were also built on the east and northwest corners of the roof of Mitsui &amp; Co., a Japanese merchant in the riverbank, and five small steel cannons with a diameter of 42 cm were set up, facing directly at the Public Security Bureau, Ningjia Bridge, and Haiguang Temple and other places. The Japanese army also chose a high place to set up cannons, intending to inflict heavy blows on our policemen, merchants, and civilians with the power of the artillery fire. Japanese Army Commander Kashi Haohei also issued a declaration yesterday and announced martial law at the same time, posting a notice saying, "According to the martial law, the Tianjin Japanese Concession is designated as an enclosed area," clearly indicating a wartime state, and declaring that those who do not obey will be killed without mercy. As a result, the people in the Concession were extremely shaken, and Chinese and Japanese merchants and civilians moved to the British and French Concessions one after another. At 8:00 am, the Japanese soldiers once prevented passage, but because the Japanese were also moving, all were allowed to move out. Now, the Concession has become a scene where ten out of ten houses are empty. However, people outside the Concession are not allowed to enter the Concession, even those holding passes are not allowed to pass. According to reports, Japanese expatriates recently received an urgent order from the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, allowing them to freely move to safe areas. Those who do not want to leave the Concession are gathered separately in the Jiangnan Foreign Firm or public hospitals, etc.</p>
<p>Japanese expatriates have moved to the British and French Concessions for temporary residence, and some have already returned to their country. However, most of those who have moved out this time are Japanese and Korean women and children, and the adult men are still waiting for orders in the Concession area. The volunteer army was fully armed and dispatched yesterday, totaling 462 people, stationed at various street intersections. The number of people is also planned to be increased due to the cause of today and tomorrow (November 28).</p>
<h3 id="e52">Japanese Army Withdraws Separately <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Effect of the Withdrawal is Unclear</p>
<p>Liaoning and Jilin are Not Abandoned</p>
<p>The Great Beauty Evening News, Shenyang, 28th: The reason for the Japanese army's sudden withdrawal is still unknown here, but Kwantung Commander Honjo seems to have decided to immediately begin withdrawing from the South Manchuria Railway (SMR) zone. According to a spokesperson for the Japanese command today, the Japanese army on the Beining Railway will begin to withdraw tonight. The Japanese command has notified the expatriates in the Japanese Concession to prepare to lodge military officers in their homes starting tonight. When reporters asked about the extent of the withdrawal, he replied that they would first restore the situation before the occupation of Qiqihar. This means that except for Zhengjiatun, Jilin City, Juliao River, and Yingkou, where the Japanese army is still stationed, all the remaining Japanese troops will be withdrawn to the SMR zone. It is said that the final batch of soldiers will not be completely withdrawn to the SMR zone, restoring the situation before September 18th, until the final adjustment of the political situation between China and Japan. It is also heard that the Japanese army coming from Korea will be sent back to their original defenses immediately because the situation in Korea is critical. American missionaries who came to Shenyang from Korea all said that the Koreans in various places are thinking of taking the opportunity to launch an independent uprising, which is imminent.</p>
<p>Continued Telegram at Noon: A spokesperson for the Japanese command suddenly and unofficially issued a news release to various newspapers, titled "Kwantung Army's Attitude Towards Jinzhou," which stated that the Shenyang Japanese army, in view of the emergency situation in Tianjin, decided to take necessary steps to allocate defensive forces. Now that the situation in Tianjin has improved, it has been decided to withdraw all the troops sent to Jinzhou back to east of the Liao River and the SMR zone to await future developments in the situation. The Japanese army has now begun to withdraw, and the troops stationed outside the SMR zone will be gradually reduced to the minimum limit. West of the Liao River, except for a few Japanese troops left to protect the Japanese consulate in Xinmin, the Japanese troops in other places are withdrawing. It was also officially announced that Captain Itakura led a reconnaissance squad on an armored train to the east of the Rao River, where they encountered the Chinese army. Itakura and a railway worker were shot and killed, and two South Manchuria Railway workers were injured. Finally, a spokesperson for the Japanese command denied that the sudden withdrawal of troops was due to political developments in Geneva and Tokyo, claiming that it was only a strategy.</p>
<p>Continued Telegram in the Evening: The Japanese army on the Beining Railway has begun to withdraw. At about 6:00 pm today, two trains loaded with soldiers, artillery, and other military supplies returned to the SMR zone. Diplomatic circles, military attachés of the League of Nations inspection representatives, and foreign newspaper correspondents have commented on this matter. Some foreign newspaper correspondents and military inspectors decided to celebrate, believing that it was the result of the second Kailuo format war in the three northeastern provinces. There are various rumors about the reasons for the withdrawal of troops. Some said it was due to pressure from New York bankers, some said it was due to the British opposition to the Japanese army's occupation of the Beining Railway, some said it was because the League of Nations would send an investigation team, and others said it was due to political reasons in Tokyo. There are also rumors that Doihara has signed a secret peace agreement with the Chinese military authorities in Tianjin. Foreign military inspectors who came to Shenyang from Tokyo still set off for Jinzhou this morning in a special car prepared by Bonkyo, and they must have been surprised when they saw the Japanese troop cars returning in droves on the way. It was also heard that a team of Chinese stragglers, seemingly informed of the Japanese withdrawal, dug up the railway several miles outside Xinmin, causing the Japanese army's withdrawal to be delayed for some time, and it was only after the engineering car was sent to repair it that it could pass. The reporter recently went to Huanggu Tun Station and heard that from 5:00 am to midnight yesterday, the station had passed 13 Japanese troop trains, a total of 221 cars. At 7:10 am this morning, a supply car was also passed, all heading towards Jinzhou. However, when the reporter arrived at the station, it was as quiet as death. The British engineer has returned to Shenyang, and only a Chinese staff member remains at the station to take care of it. As for the Qiqihar and Taoang Railway lines, according to a spokesperson for the Japanese command, a large detachment of the Qiqihar garrison will be withdrawn soon, and the Japanese army in Taonan may also be withdrawn.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Japanese Army Digs Up <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Beining Railway Police's Hidden Weapons</p>
<p>Railway Staff Detained and Tortured in Various Ways Such as in the Toilet</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the September 18th Incident, the Beining Railway secretly buried the firearms used by the railway police in the public residence of the railway staff at the north entrance of Sanjing Road in the Shenyang Commercial Port. Unexpectedly, it was detected by the Japanese army, and dozens of Japanese soldiers with iron helmets suddenly went to search and dig up the area on the 11th of this month. Almost all the firearms were searched and taken away (at that time, the railway staff in the residence were interrogated with various means, forced and threatened, and detained in the toilet, forced to eat urine residue, and tortured in every possible way. According to the people who came from Shenyang, the Japanese army's tyrannical situation at that time is really infuriating.</p>
<p>Since the incident, the Beining Railway Office in Shenyang has been unable to perform its duties, so it has been moved to Jinzhou. However, more than a dozen deputy section chiefs, Zhang Baohua, and staff members were still sent to stay in Shenyang. On the 11th of this month, when the deputy section chief and others gathered at the railway's public residence on Sanjing Road in the commercial port, more than 20 Japanese soldiers with iron helmets suddenly broke into the courtyard with guns at 0:30 pm. They immediately asked where the toilet was and forcibly led the clerk Wang Weilun to the toilet. After digging in various places for a long time, they found nothing. Then they smashed the doors of each room and searched through the houses, but found nothing. Then they entered the board room in the northwest corner of the backyard, pushed down the board wall, and dug in the ground. They found all the rifles, portable machine guns, mortars, pistols, and ammunition buried there by order of the Fengtian Provincial Government. They then forced all the more than a dozen staff members in the residence, including Zhang Baohua and Zhang Fengxian, as well as a child of a staff member, to gather in the center of the courtyard and interrogated them by name about who hid the firearms and where Director Hu was now. If they lied, they would be shot to death. The staff members all replied that the Beining Railway Office in Shenyang had long ceased to function, and the rest of them were staying here temporarily because they had no money to go home. As for the burying of firearms, it may have been done by the railway police when they fled in a hurry. They really did not know the details and did not know where Director Hu was.</p>
<p>The Japanese soldiers had no choice but to order Wang Weilun to lead them to the living room, smash open the rooms of the public residence administrator Liu Shiyuan and the office desk, and take away a string of keys to the various gates of the main station, the key to the treasury of the General Affairs Section, and Liu Shiyuan's photo. They returned to the courtyard, searched the pockets of each person's clothes, and drove them all into the South Warehouse, forcing them into one room and guarding them with soldiers. They also forced several servants to go to the backyard to help load the searched firearms into heavy-duty vehicles and transport them away one after another. At the same time, they also loaded more than a dozen people, including Zhang Baohua, into a car and drove them to the Japanese army headquarters at the South Manchuria Hospital at the Japanese station. They drove them into the underground toilet of the department where prisoners were detained. The floor was full of feces and urine, there were no doors and windows, the stench was foul, and it was extremely cold. They were forced to sit around in one corner and were not allowed to speak or move. Guards were stationed all around. The guards repeatedly beat and insulted them, ordered them to eat the feces and urine that had been left behind, threatened them with their hands raising guns and bayonets, and inflicted various tortures such as hitting their heads with sticks and pulling out their hair. At more than 10:00 am the next morning, Zhang Baohua was brought in for interrogation, and then Zhang Fengxian and others were taken away separately to inquire about the hidden firearms. The answers were the same as before. Until 2:00 pm, the Japanese army saw that they could not get any information, so they released Zhang Baohua and others first. Finally, they brought in Zhang Boren, a clerk, and more than a dozen servants and interrogated them about the hiding of firearms. They also kicked and beat the servants vigorously, but they did not confess any other information. Earlier, several employees escaped from the guardhouse when the Japanese soldiers broke in, and hastily reported the above situation to the General Bureau. Upon receiving the report, the General Bureau urgently telegraphed Stiehl, the director of the transportation office stationed in Shenyang, to go and negotiate. When Stiehl rushed to the Japanese army headquarters, more than a dozen employees had been completely released at about the evening of that day. The Railway Bureau felt deeply sorry for the fact that the employees had been detained for a day and night, frozen, starved, and frightened, and had been abused. It has sent personnel to express condolences and provided consolation money to show its consideration. It is said that this incident was caused by a former clerk of the bureau who had been dismissed for wrongdoing, who harbored a grudge and reported it to the Japanese army. If so, then that clerk is helping the tiger to harm others, and his flesh is still edible (November 27).</p>
<h3 id="e54">Regarding the Shenyang Incident <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Centered Public Opinion</p>
<p>Implying the Maturity of the Second Phase of Continental Policy</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence: From the Shenyang Incident on September 18th until recently, two months have passed. The former bustling customs post is now desolate and filled with sorrow, and the problem remains shrouded in dark clouds. Now, temporarily avoiding a review of the facts, let us introduce some Japanese public opinions regarding the Shenyang Incident. Isn't the intention of the Japanese people already obvious?</p>
<p>Firstly, this is the proposition of a powerful Japanese opposition party (Seiyukai). It has four concrete central ideas: (1) Manchuria and Mongolia, in terms of their position in the Far East and historical relationship, are entirely special regions unrelated to China. (2) The entire region of Manchuria and Mongolia should promote economic development based on the principles of "Open Door" and "Equal Opportunity," while also making Manchuria and Mongolia a place of residence for both internal and external people. (3) Maintain the security of Manchuria and Mongolia and steadfastly protect Japan's rights and interests. (4) Those who infringe upon the above three main points should be resisted with the strength of the entire nation. The deduction of this theory is that they regard Manchuria and Mongolia as Japanese territory. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the Shenyang Incident, they should use the military strength of the entire nation to eradicate the "Chinese" forces in this land and simultaneously settle accounts for the incompetence of "Shidehara Diplomacy." This kind of argument is currently very influential.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is to urge "China" to respect treaty rights and interests. On the other hand, it should connect with friendly nations without placing Japan in a state of isolation. In other words, after the demise of the "Anglo-Japanese Alliance," Japan has lost countries with harmonious relations in the recent world. At the time of the Shenyang Incident's outbreak, it is even more necessary to connect with a friendly nation that can support Japan's Manchurian and Mongolian policy. This public opinion heavily criticizes the Japanese foreign affairs authorities for their lack of effort, or at least criticizes the inadequacy of their efforts. This is the general and common opinion.</p>
<p>Thirdly, this proposition is also a representative of ruthless and vicious military personnel. They believe that the Japanese foreign affairs authorities' "proposal to demand respect for treaties and confirmation of rights and interests" is a mistake. To put it bluntly, Manchuria and Mongolia have a very deep relationship with Japan. Whoever invades Manchuria and Mongolia should be punished. The world's interference in Manchuria and Mongolia should be regarded as an enemy. Therefore, this Shenyang Incident is not merely "China's" disrespect for treaties; it is simply "China's" attack on Japan's ideal territory. Manchuria and Mongolia should deal with it with the final determination.</p>
<p>Fourthly, this wonderful theory comes from the Japanese diplomatic circle. It believes that the major issue of handling the Shenyang Incident should be addressed by a specialized committee of the League of Nations. The committee should examine a reasonable method for resolving the Manchurian and Mongolian issues. In the end, this solution is to adopt the "mandate system," and under this mandate system, establish the future fate of our Northeast.</p>
<p>Fifthly, this is an observation from the perspective of a socialist. They believe that the current protection of Japan's rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia is unreasonable. They say that although Japan's investment in Manchuria and Mongolia has reached 1.5 billion yen, the majority of it is investment by the Zaibatsu (financial conglomerates). The so-called protection of Manchurian and Mongolian rights and interests only results in an increase in the profits of a few bourgeois individuals. Under these circumstances, Japan absolutely has no need to sacrifice 100,000 lives or 200,000 units of national expenditure. However, if capitalist Japan collapses and socialist Japan is born, then it would be worthwhile to fight a decisive battle for Manchuria and Mongolia. The protection of Manchurian and Mongolian rights and interests under socialism is the lifeline of all Japanese citizens. This theory is relatively fresh.</p>
<p>Among the above five representative public opinions, regardless of the speaker's position or whether the remarks criticize the current Japanese government, there seems to be a consistent argument for "maintaining Manchuria and Mongolia." It also very clearly implies the maturity of Japan's second phase of continental policy. The recent outbreak of the Shenyang Incident is merely a phenomenon of labor pains during pregnancy. The long night is endless, and the future is truly unbearable to imagine. Although the Third International Council has already been convened, we dare to assert that there will be no justice in the international community. Self-preservation depends on self-strengthening. Japan can continuously invade the mainland, but can China continuously seek help from the League of Nations? (November 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Taiwan <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Rogue Elements Disrupting Fuzhou Conspiracy</p>
<p>Now Completely Exposed</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the Japanese warship "Maru-shima" sailed into the inner harbor of Fuzhou, the social atmosphere in Minyuan has suddenly become tense. Adding to this, for several consecutive days, seven bombs were discovered on the side of Cangshan Mountain near the South Gate of the city, and a fire broke out in a Taiwanese opium den in Lane Kuai Li within the city. Rumors arose for a time, and the people were panicked. Military and police agencies also tightened security. Traffic was cut off at 10:00 PM each night, and the situation was particularly serious. Later, after investigation by the authorities, it was discovered that Taiwanese rogue elements were causing trouble from within, hoping to cause conflict between China and Japan, so that they could take advantage of the opportunity to profit. Therefore, they falsely reported to the Japanese consul that Chinese student militias were planning to attack the consulate. On the one hand, they reported to the Chinese military and police that Japanese people and Taiwanese people had organized a riot team to plot to throw bombs, set fires, and rob, etc. Both sides believed it to be true. The "Maru-shima" warship immediately removed its gun covers and set up machine guns. The consulate then turned off the lights at night and dispatched Japanese police officers to cooperate with sailors to patrol around the inside and outside of the building. Important Japanese people also prepared to leave Min. Seeing that the Japanese side was taking such action, and confirming the bomb incident at Nanmendou and the fire incident at Lane Kuai Li, our military and police also greatly increased security. It was not until the Japanese consul saw that Chinese students were attending classes as usual without any disturbance, and also heard rumors that Taiwanese people, such as a Mr. Liu, a Mr. Li, and a Mr. Ke, were spreading rumors and deceiving the public, that he realized that he had been deceived. He immediately sent Mr. Liu back to his hometown, and Mr. Li and Mr. Ke also hid and dared not come out. The conspiracy of the rogue elements was thus completely exposed. (November 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e56">Wan and Bao Return to Ping After Visiting Jin <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Wan Discusses Diplomacy, Still Leaving the Matter to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Bao Discusses Diplomacy, Still Not Completely Despairing</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Zhang Xueliang recently sent Wan Fulin, accompanied by Bao Wenwei, from Ping to Beijing to meet with Chairman Chiang. They left Beijing by train on the afternoon of the 27th and returned north. Today (the 28th) at 6:00 PM, they arrived in Jinan. Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun, Provincial Government Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang, Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie, and Chief of Staff of the Third Route Army Li Zongbi and others welcomed them at the station. Wan Fulin got off the train at Jinan Station to meet with Han Fuju, while Bao Wenwei returned to Ping in the same train to report everything to Zhang Xueliang. According to Wan Fulin's remarks, this trip to Beijing was to represent Deputy Commander Zhang in consulting with Commander-in-Chief Chiang on diplomatic issues. They have generally reached an agreement. Regarding diplomacy, the central government is handling it in a coordinated manner. At present, they are still leaving it to the League of Nations to handle everything, hoping to preserve peace. Commander-in-Chief Chiang will not come to Ping for the time being, he said. According to Bao Wenwei, this trip to Beijing to meet with Commander-in-Chief Chiang involved considerable discussion on diplomacy. There is still considerable hope for the current diplomatic methods. Gu Weijun is scheduled to take office as Minister of Foreign Affairs on Monday (the 30th). If diplomacy truly has no solutions, then the only option is to do it without regard for the consequences. Chairman Wan got off the train in Jinan to meet with Chairman Han. He will probably go north early tomorrow (the 29th). The rest will return to Ping first to report everything to Deputy Commander Zhang, he said.</p>
<p>After Wan Fulin got off the train, he exchanged brief greetings with Han Fuju and Peng Shibin, the representative of Zhang Xueliang stationed in Jinan, on the platform. He then rode in a car with Han to the provincial government, where he rested in Han's office and had dinner. Wan and Han discussed the journey to Beijing in detail and discussed the security of North China. On the morning of the 29th, he will go north on the second train to return to Ping.

<h3 id="e57">Central and National Government Memorial Week <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM on November 30th, the Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week in the Great Hall of the Central Party Headquarters. Central Committee members Dai Kui Sheng, Chen Guofu, Shao Yuanchong, and others, as well as staff from various departments and bureaus, and guests, totaling about 500 people, attended. Chairman Chen Guofu presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, Shao Yuanchong gave a report, which stated that China's internal continuous disputes have led to political division and the weakening of national power. All construction cannot be carried out. In addition, discipline has been abandoned, and the people lack a spirit of abiding by the law, resulting in the instability of social order. In education, it has failed to adapt to the environment of the country and the people and the needs of the new era, and measures have not been appropriate, causing the people's patriotic psychology and movement to sometimes fail to fully conform to the norm. Scientific knowledge has not been fully developed. Therefore, imperialists are using our country's weaknesses to intensify their aggressive policies, causing continuous crises for our country and nation. The most inhumane Japanese imperialism, based on its consistent traditional policy of aggression against China, has recently become rampant, and its ambitions are fully exposed. It uses various insidious means to deceive the League of Nations and confuse the truth, so that international justice cannot be fully upheld. At this time of crisis for our country,</p>
<p>if we do not awaken and urgently catch up to correct past mistakes and remedy past shortcomings, then danger is imminent, and the consequences will be unimaginable. Therefore, when the Fourth Plenary Session was convened, it unanimously sought to realize unity within the party based on the principles of fraternity and sincerity, create a unified country through unity within the party, use political momentum to consolidate the foundation of the country, and then make every effort to cope with the national crisis, use extremely effective methods to eliminate all obstacles, resist armed aggression, and resolve the current major crisis. On the side of our party, we should absolutely take responsibility. I especially hope that our entire nation will share this goal, proceed in unison, and take disciplined and efficient actions in the midst of common struggles, abide by the law, and not overstep boundaries. We must also know that China's weakness is not the result of one morning and one evening. The fundamental reason lies in the lack of daily education and the slow progress of scientific knowledge. The powerful foundation of any imperialist or socialist country in the world lies not only in military and political power, but in the development of economic power through scientific power, so that the country becomes rich and strong day by day. Therefore, we should pay close attention to the basic dangers of our country and work together to find a path to resolve them, so that we can have hope of resisting foreign aggression and prevent the recurrence of bullying and oppression in the future, etc. After the report, the meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held the Prime Minister's Memorial Week. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, as well as the heads of various Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions, including Dai Chuanxian, Shao Yuanchong, Lin Sen, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Song Ziwen, Ma Fuxiang, Wang Boqun, Yang Shuzhuang, Li Shuhua, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Bulei, Chen Shaokuan, Gu Zhenglun, Wu Siyu, Zhou Yawei, etc., as well as all staff from the three offices of civil affairs, military affairs, and accounting, attended. Chairman Chiang led the ceremony as usual. Then, President Dai gave a report, stating that the current diplomatic situation is urgent and the country is in danger. The ancients once said that a country that has no external enemies will always perish. If we want to cope with difficulties, we must not have other new plans or work. We only need to abide by the Prime Minister's teachings, earnestly believe that everyone should double their efforts in their profession. The government's responsibility is not only to be the public servant of the people but also to be the leader of the nation. It must lead the people to seek common construction, protect the foundation of the country, and overcome difficulties, etc. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Today, the Wuxian Anti-Japanese Association Will Conduct a General Inspection of Japanese Goods. It has been decided that today (the 1st), the Wuxian Anti-Japanese Association will begin a general inspection of Japanese goods in various stores. More than 5,000 students from various secondary schools will depart simultaneously this morning, dividing into two groups at Lvmenguan and Guanqian to inspect and seal off the goods.

<p>Wuxian Business Tax Amount Dispute: Director Yang of the Wuxian Business Tax Bureau intends to increase the tax amounts for various industries such as gold and silver, money, and embroidery. The respective industries have submitted reports to the Ministry of Industry, the Provincial Government, and the Finance Office, saying that after the exemption was added, they then received instructions from the Finance Office that the request was not approved. They then received an order from the Provincial Government, saying that since they had submitted reports separately, they should wait for the Ministry of Industry to review and handle the matter. Yesterday, they received instructions from the Ministry of Industry, saying that they had consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government for review and handling. Therefore, this matter will probably have no solution in the shortest period. The Tax Bureau has sent personnel to various townships to directly collect taxes from various business stations. The receipts issued specify that summer goods from the north and south will be collected and remitted by the same industry on behalf of the business tax. How can taxes be collected directly? Are the previously filled registration certificates still valid? Furthermore, the summer tax payments have already been remitted, which is considered a tax disruption to business operations. Yesterday (the 30th), they specially submitted a report through the Chamber of Commerce to the Ministry of Finance and the Provincial Government for fair review and handling. It is also heard that the Suzhou Finance Office has scheduled December 3rd to convene representatives of the Chambers of Commerce of various counties to discuss the business tax law. The County Chamber of Commerce here resolved yesterday to nominate Cheng Ganqing as a representative to attend the provincial meeting, representing Suzhou merchants, stating the state of commercial decline.</p>

Therefore, when it opened in 1929, it purchased original silk reeling machines and equipment from Japan. Since then, it has been completely imitated and manufactured by our country. As for silk reeling, it adopts the world's latest methods. A Korean, Li Guanghua, was hired as a technician. Although the term was not over after the Ten Thousand Incident, he was immediately dismissed and left Xizhi long ago. As for imitating the Japanese silk reeling method, it is a world scientific public matter. Industry is changing rapidly every day, and it should be encouraged. Fearing that misunderstandings would occur, a letter has been sent yesterday to declare this.</p>

<p>Details of the Datda Steamer Robbery at Liuyu: The Datda Steamship Company's Dade steamer, which was en route from Shanghai to the Upper Yangtze, passed through Nantong Tianshenggang at 12:00 AM on the 27th. At approximately 1:00 AM on the 28th, when it reached the Liuyu river surface in Taixing County, it was suddenly robbed by bandits. The search and robbery lasted for two hours, and no passengers were spared. The details of the robbery are recorded below: When the Dade steamer departed from Shanghai on the 27th, bandits disguised as passengers had already purchased tickets and boarded the ship. Later, when passing through Tongru, more bandits joined. When the ship reached Liuyu, a rowboat came from the north bank, first using a flashlight to signal. The bandits on the ship each took out pistols and started the attack, ordering the workers in the engine room to stop the ship. Together with the bandits on the rowboat, there were more than 50 people, who searched the ticket office and cargo compartments. The bandits all wore Red Army insignia and carried firearms. The ticket office was searched three times in a row, but only a little more than 400 yuan was robbed. They fired shots in the cargo hold to show off their power. Because they did not get any cash, they focused on the passengers. No passenger in the officer's cabin was spared. Their suitcases were robbed, and they were all looted. Only a passenger surnamed Zhu lost 400 yuan, and a female passenger's dowry jewelry, which she had prepared in Shanghai, was a relatively large amount. The rest were all small amounts of money and small pieces of jewelry. The copper coins carried by the passengers in the general cabin were also robbed. Many of the passengers' clothes and shoes were also stripped off. Five large rolls of cloth were robbed from the cargo hold. Because the rowboat was already full of suitcases, two rolls were returned. A bag of rice was also robbed. At 3:30 AM, they shouted, boarded the rowboat, and escaped. An insignia with the words "Red Army Division No. 2020" was left on the ship. According to statistics, the total loss for the company and passengers was approximately more than 6,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The Western Youth Basketball Association had a total of three games yesterday. In Group A, Pirates beat Xiaguang 38 to 22, Mailing beat Huadong 39 to 27. In Group B, Junior beat Wing Team 37 to 24. In the first half, Junior led 25 to 12.</p>

<p>The Pirates are elite and good at fighting. Those who meet them often lose. Xiaguang was in an unfavorable state, but they actually took the lead twice in the first half, which can be said to have exhausted their ability to resist. Not long after the start, Xiaguang took the lead with a strong hand, first leading 6 to 2, and then leading 11 to 9. In the second half, the enemy's momentum was strong, and Xiaguang suffered successive losses. As a result, the score was 38 to 22. In the first half, the Pirates won 17 to 12. The Pirates had Shi Ya on the outside and Pi Lei on the inside, who were like lively dragons and tigers and unpredictable. Xiaguang was most active with Wei Zuoan, but the inner guards were slightly weaker, resulting in unevenness between the front and back. Referee Shao Yi.</p>

<p>Liang Guoquan scored two consecutive goals, and Huadong immediately took a 4-0 lead over Mailing. In a blink of an eye, Mailing took the lead with 5-4. Huang Yunliang got the passes from Dai Linzhen and Ling Xianyang and added two goals, and the momentum became even stronger. Mailing worked hard to follow, but eventually fell behind. Before long, Liang and Dai cooperated with each other, creating a 16-13 advantage for Huadong in the first half. In the second half, Dai Linzhen and Chen Qidong played, replacing Huan Yang, Yongyuan, and Li Baojun, and the overall strength of the army was relatively weakened. Mailing took this opportunity to jump ahead. After five minutes of fighting, the score was tied at 23 again. After that, Mailing was seen rushing around, with 37 to 27 as the final victory result.</p>

<p>— Yan Zi</p>
<p>After the Xianfeng period of the Qing Dynasty, overseas vassals such as Korea, Ryukyu, and Vietnam were all annexed by strong neighbors. China was unable to prevent it. The Sino-French War of Jiashen was caused by Vietnam. Vietnam bordered Guangxi. In the Battle of Lang Son, Governor Feng Zicai of Guangxi was the first to bear the brunt. He tried his best to resist the invaders but failed repeatedly. Later, Wang, with the help of his drunk friends, captured the French army transporting the equipment. Because of the lack of ammunition in the front line, the front line was defeated. At that time, the French Navy Admiral Courbet was shot and killed by a naval student in the Battle of Mawei. The military prestige was greatly reduced. Each court official had thoughts on how to solve the situation, negotiating peace with France. The public uproar grew. Chen Zhefu, a candidate who participated in the Japanese government, and a junior official, followed the imperial commissioner Xu Chengzuyuan back to China. He deeply hated the ways of the Japanese. At the time of the Meiji Restoration, he strongly advocated self-improvement and reform. Japan had already swallowed Ryukyu and was trying to蚕食Korea, so he already despised China and wanted to make a difference. Chen enumerated the crimes of Japan. He requested to move the victorious army from Lang Son to征征 Japan and question Ryukyu, the whole article in more than 2,000 words. It was widely circulated at one time, but the Grand Council of Minister Xu Yongyi knew well the minds of the two palaces (Empress Dowager was纵情 and enjoying herself while building the Summer Palace.) The emperor did not express an opinion. The court thought the young boy was wrong to start border wars. The emperor ignored the suggestion, missing a good opportunity. The treacherous officials have misled the country for thousands of years, making people feel infinite emotion. Moreover, there was a famous division, and the division was strong. If at that time, according to Zhefu's intention, the army was transferred eastward, then Ryukyu could be restored, Korea would not be destroyed, and how could the root cause of the Sino-Japanese War be caused, and the fence would be completely removed.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Qian Hezhou's Defense Against Japanese Pirates <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Xiaohua</p>
<p>During the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, Japanese pirates disturbed Jiangyin. At that time, the magistrate Qian Hezhou, a native of Jingzhou, was 26 years old. He defended and resisted with Yang Ku, Xu Rong of Qingqiao, and the righteous servant Zhu Gui. He died for his country. His loyalty and courage are enough to influence future generations. At that time, it was the 33rd year of Jiajing. There was a Japanese police in Cheng when the Spring Festival was celebrated. Only the East Gate was left for entry and exit, and the other three gates were closed to prevent changes. In the evening, foreigners flocked into the city. The gate was congested, and 47 people were trampled to death. On April 28, the Japanese suddenly arrived at Qingqiao from Huangsipu. Xu Rong had already blocked the port. Qian Gong ordered him to lead the militia to repel them. Another group of Japanese came from the south. Rong returned to the army to meet the attack north of Yangxu, a place called Sanguantang. The thief's crossbow was fired indiscriminately, and the soldiers had no armor. So he left. The righteous servant Chen Xu Rong was only spared. The village was terribly burned and killed by the thieves. Xu Rong's house was also burned. Xu Rong once wrote a poem to commemorate it: "Holding his wife and children in front of the horse, everywhere he frowned and mourned for the dead family. The huts were burnt to ashes, and the roads were lost and his eyes were faint. The old site was desolate, and the spring swallow was injured, and the bleak remains filled the late crows. Looking up at the desolation, the hatred was infinite, and from where to enjoy life."</p>
<p>In the 34th year of Jiajing, more than 3,000 Japanese pirates from Changshu joined together and divided from the river. The pirates attacked Qingjiang and landed at Caigang. Qian Gong, the county magistrate, was ordered by Wang Chonggu, the commander of the army, to lead his troops to aid Jing, but he returned in a hurry after receiving the news. The Japanese had already arrived at the bridge, but they failed to attack the city. They retreated to defend the Chaqing sluice gate (now called Nanzha Town) and plundered day and night. The smoke and fire connected the sky, and nearly 10,000 villagers entered the city to take refuge. Qian Gong was furious and wanted to fight, but the county soldiers were no more than 400 people, plus 1,000 soldiers from Guangdong and Guangxi. So, on June 23, he left the city to fight. First, the soldiers from Guangdong and Guangxi were indulgent. Qian punished them according to the law. They fled when they met the bandits. Qian alone fought against the enemy with more than 50 of his personal soldiers. Yang Cheng, a personal soldier, hated the Japanese for their slaughter and was especially brave. Qian encountered the Japanese and fought at Jiuliwan, commonly known as Mopandun (now outside the South Gate). The terrain was dangerous and the horse fell. Yang Cheng hurriedly exchanged his horse for him. Suddenly, the Japanese bandits ambushed in the grass and stabbed Qian Gong with knives. He was stabbed several times, but he still fought the bandits with all his strength. The Japanese pirates stabbed Qian with spears, and his body was as broken as mud. More than 20 righteous soldiers died with Qian. Xue Jia, a villager, cried and buried him among the dead soldiers.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Evening Two Days Before Zhimo's Accident <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>Zhimo is dead. Life is a busy pursuit, and every day we inevitably move towards death. Death is unavoidable, so why should death cause such grief? However, the way death touches people's emotions and impacts talent determines whether it is heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather. Zhimo did not die in a national crisis, nor in pursuit of academic endeavors, nor due to other matters related to society or personal affairs, but in a plane crash. He died without deserving it, his life lighter than a feather. This causes emotional distress and is something Zhimo himself, even in death, would not have wished for. Therefore, people lament his death, regretting the loss of his talent and lamenting his misfortune. Zhimo's scholarship and talent are well-known to everyone; I will not repeat them here. After Zhimo returned to the south, I met him at the Modern Painting Exhibition. He seemed very pleased with his wife, Madam Xiaoman's, paintings and expressed his gratitude to me. In reality, Madam Xiaoman was already quite knowledgeable about painting. I was merely providing some consultation. Moreover, the consultation time was quite short. How could it be considered instruction? When we parted, we made arrangements for a crab feast. Zhimo had brought a basket of crabs from his home in Xiashi. Xiashi is known for its crabs. A day later, I visited his residence. Zhimo entered from outside, shook my hand, and greeted me warmly. Soon, we sat down to eat crabs. We enjoyed the creamy roe and plump meat. Some at the table were not skilled at eating them, so Zhimo taught them how to dissect them. During the meal, we talked about his experience on a Ford plane between Beijing and Ping. He said that north of the Yellow River, the fields below looked dark purple, and south of the river, the fields looked red, very smooth and clean. The layout of the fields and paths was like a chessboard, very orderly. As for the cities, towns, and places where people gathered, they were like ant colonies or swarms of gnats, busily working. At this point, he suddenly sighed and said, "I never imagined that in this small area, there would be so much worry and joy." I said, "The 'Autumn Floods' chapter of Zhuangzi emphasizes this three times. Why should I be surprised?" Madam Xiaoman, seeing that Zhimo's eye condition had not yet fully recovered, advised him to eat less. Zhimo then said to me, "I am very fond of this food. When I was in Beiping, my eye condition was caused by it. Now it is almost recovered." He then encouraged me and others to eat more. I had already eaten dinner, so I ate only two. Zhimo then drank three cups of wine, his spirits high. He got up and began to sing loudly and dance like a myna. This was the happiest I had ever seen him. Wu Ziguan, entrusted by Li, wanted Zhimo's calligraphy, which he had asked for three years ago. Taking this opportunity, he asked Zhimo to write. Zhimo, in high spirits, wrote the "Fisherman" chapter by Qu Yuan. After finishing, it looked just like Zheng Haizang's work. It was late, so I shook hands and said goodbye. Zhimo said, "I will only be gone for three weeks and will return soon. We will see each other soon." We said our goodbyes and I left. The next morning, I also took a car back to Xi. Alas, who knew that this half-night of joyful conversation would be the second-to-last night of Zhimo's life? Alas, I did not have a deep, long-lasting friendship with Zhimo, but we had been connected spiritually for years. I saw his wife, Madam Xiaoman, more often when she studied landscape painting with me, but that was only in the first half of the year. Since May, I had been on leave for three or four days due to being busy and the hot weather. Last month, I returned from leave and met with Zhimo again. This meeting was the last one. Alas. Zhimo, lamenting the lack of excellent works in the history of Chinese painting, had asked me to compile a history of Chinese painters. He had even compared arm strength with me; Zhimo was also a martial arts practitioner. Alas, Zhimo! Alas, Zhimo!</p>

<p>— Jian Mang</p>
<p>At the end of a rugged world, poets are destined to be buried in the sky. If he transforms into a crane in Liaodong in another life, he will weep at the setting sun and the red blood of war.</p>
<p>Transforming into a Peng bird, flying all over the sky, his ambition was never small in his youth. Who would have thought he would become a feathered immortal today? From now on, he will not return to the human world. (Zhimo, in his anthology, published an article titled "Wanting to Fly," in which he described how he deeply admired the soaring of vultures over the top of pagodas in his childhood.)</p>
<h3 id="e103">A Song for You <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Man</p>
<p>Shakespeare has a poem titled "A Song for You." I once translated its meaning into five-character prose and published it in the "Saturday Weekly." It says, "I sing for the love of you, not for the sake of the song itself. The song may disappear, but its memory remains in your heart. If you remember me, my song will always be joyful. When you leave me, it will be a source of comfort. In the brightly lit happy night, we forget to go home in laughter and talk. I sing for you again, and we are comfortable tonight. There is no loneliness anymore, as if we are close to each other. I sing for the love of you; please do not forget my feelings." The poem has a wonderful artistic conception, but unfortunately, I lack the ability to translate it into rhyming verse.</p>
<p>The other day, I happened to go to the movies and heard the singing of Ms. Ruth Chatterton, which resembled Shakespeare's song. A famous person and a famous song, coming from the beautiful mouth of a lady, made it even more charming. I usually do not like talking movies because I always feel that I cannot understand the European accents completely. However, in the love songs in sound movies, I often find one or two good verses. How moving a song is!</p>
<p>Since ancient times, our country has spared no effort in studying music and song. Romantic anecdotes and rumors are often spread through songs. In unofficial histories, there are many old stories of singing venues, which are widely circulated. Recently, the Mingxing Film Company released sound films such as "Such is Paradise" and "Sing-song Girl Red Peony," and the Tianyi Film Company released the sound film "Spring Colors of the Singing Venue." All of them use the singing venue as a decoration. What a pity is that the performance and emotions are not fully integrated.</p>
<p>Recently, Ms. Xuan Jinglin told me that she had recently starred in a new film by Mingxing Film Company, "Eternal Farewell of a Beautiful Woman." The film is silent and directed by the great director Zheng Zhengqiu. The female lead, named Yu Ren, is a singer. Although we cannot hear the songs in the film, we can sense the tension of the plot and the intensity of the emotions, making it an unprecedented work among domestic films and giving the audience a feeling that "silence is better than sound at this time."</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Ms. Xuan is good at singing. However, in the film "Eternal Farewell of a Beautiful Woman," she does not move people with her singing but with her delicate expressions. Perhaps it is like what Shakespeare said in his poem: "The song may disappear, but its memory remains in your heart."</p>
<h3 id="e104">Jue Lin Returns <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>Last summer, Mr. Fen exhibited his calligraphy and seal carvings at Jue Lin. At that time, many people gathered to praise him. Juan also wrote an article about it. Now Mr. Fen has released new works and is sharing them with enthusiasts again. How grand! Mr. Fen is not yet forty years old but is proficient in all four forms of calligraphy. He is especially excellent in seal script and clerical script. For example, the five-foot couplet "With downward eyes, ninety thousand miles, sitting and watching the eighteen dukes," his style is similar to Yi Bingshou. The five-foot coral paper inscription pair, copied from Qian Shilan, has no current bad habits of recklessness but has a natural air. The five-foot Zhongtang inscription of Yue Wu Mu's "Man Jiang Hong" in its entirety also shows skilled workmanship and is completed in one go. I love his four-foot vertical scroll even more, the seal script "Three Qin Records People's Ballads," which is refined. Gentle but not flattering, clear but not stained. I stroked and admired it, reluctant to let it go. At that time, Mr. Wang Xishen also arrived and especially appreciated his "There is still a thatched roof to lodge swallows, how can there be no half-grain to reach the fish in the pond," saying that it was the saying of a benevolent person, but he did not know which family this poem came from. I asked Mr. Fen, who said it was his own work. He is indeed skilled in poetry. Many exquisite works were displayed in the venue. They imitated the Qin and Han dynasties and were extremely wonderful. Xishen bought two copies and left. I also could not stay for long due to errands and disappointedly returned, but my mind's eye still seemed to see the flower-paper seals, shining red among the three true and six cursive scripts.</p>

<p>Bicycle City: According to a recent survey, the bicycle, which has long been disliked, seems to be becoming popular again. This is because the production of bicycle factories has increased dramatically compared to the past seven or eight years. Although it is rare to see bicycles in several major cities these years, there are still some towns that are known as bicycle cities. For example, Bedford in England is the most famous bicycle city. The number of bicycles per capita is the highest in all of England. This is probably because the surrounding terrain is flat. Because there are many cyclists, general stores have special bicycle parking facilities to provide customers with convenience. In addition to Bedford, almost everyone in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, rides a bicycle.</p>
<p>The Hague is the same. These two places can be truly called bicycle cities. In Berlin, the capital of Germany, the streets are also filled with bicycles when workers go to and from work. There are workshops in factories outside the city to accommodate thousands of bicycles because it is the cheapest and easiest way for people to get around.</p>

<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>The first territory of our country to be forcibly occupied by the neighboring Japanese was Ryukyu, followed by Taiwan. In 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed. Li Jingfang, under orders, met with the Japanese General Kabayama and transferred Taiwan. From then on, Taiwan fell to a foreign race, never to recover. Yesterday, Mr. Zhang from the Tainan newspaper went to England via Shanghai. The Shanghai colleagues of the China Newspaper Society held a farewell dinner. During the dinner, they talked about the extremely difficult situation of Taiwanese newspapers and the utmost efforts they made. They sobbed and wept, unable to control themselves. Therefore, I recorded one or two of them. How can it only be like Lu Jia's "New Words"?</p>
<p>Newspapers as Tools: This year's census shows that Taiwan currently has a population of 4.56 million. There are four daily newspapers and four weekly newspapers, all of which are founded by Japanese people as semi-official and semi-private ventures. The one in Taipei is called Taiwan Daily News, with a daily circulation of 15,000, the best in Taiwan. There is Taiwan News in Taichung, with a daily circulation of 8,000. Tainan has Tainan New News, with a daily circulation of 10,000. Dong Taiwan News is located in Hualienjiang, with a daily sale of 3,000. The weekly newspaper in Taipei is Jingshi New News, with 5,000 copies each time. South Japan New News has 3,000 copies at a time. Showa New News and Nan Ying New News each have 2,000 copies. Xin Gao New News is located in Keelung, with a weekly sale of 6,000 copies. The above newspapers are all tools of the Japanese government. Every word and sentence obeys the orders of the Japanese. If the government calls a deer a horse, then all the newspapers will call a deer a horse. A piece of news released in the evening will be seen in all the newspapers the next morning, and not a single word can be changed. On Chinese issues, they often criticize and slander, turning black into white.</p>
<p>Daily Restrictions: In addition to the above eight official newspapers, the Japanese Osaka Asahi and other major newspapers are also imported, about several thousand copies a day. Taiwanese people resent the entry of compatriots into misery and the lack of freedom of speech. They gathered gentlemen and people of vision to form Taiwan Xinmin Co., Ltd., regarding China as their motherland and calling themselves overseas Taiwanese Chinese. They raised 370,000 yuan to engage in national movement, allocating 100,000 yuan to edit Taiwan Xinmin Daily, secretly advocating national revolution and awakening national consciousness. The newspaper became a thorn in the side of the Japanese, who spared no effort in trampling and destroying it. However, the newspaper did not yield but painstakingly maintained itself for ten years, with a circulation of nearly 10,000. It repeatedly wanted to change to a daily newspaper but was always prohibited. This is because newspapers must obtain a permit from the Japanese authorities before they can be published daily without hindrance.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Country Bumpkin Visits Shanghai Again (33) <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>The country bumpkin was stunned to see the chartered cars on the road coming and going like shuttles. He not only saw that those "female Zhuges" were all holding strange and colorful feather fans in their hands, but also saw that they were all carrying small leather wallets. The country bumpkin suspected what was in these girls' wallets. Could they all be female students going to school? But what kind of books are they studying at night? Unless Shanghai has opened a lot of midnight girls' schools. Otherwise, are they all female shop assistants, carrying those wallets, going out to collect debts? But sitting in such fancy cars, these debt collectors are a bit too wealthy.</p>
<p>There was another chartered car passing by the country bumpkin, and he felt a flash of light in front of him. It turned out that there were many electric lights on the chartered car. The country bumpkin counted the electric lights on the chartered car, and there were exactly seven of them. The country bumpkin suddenly had an idea:</p>
<p>"That's right! That's right! This is a performer! Her name is Seven Lamps. I've heard people from Shanghai say that there's a female actor named Seven Lamps. I didn't know why she was called Seven Lamps? Now look at this car, isn't it clearly fitted with seven lamps? This must be Seven Lamps without a doubt."</p>
<p>The country bumpkin looked around. He forgot to ask the rickshaw puller to find his nephew and just walked around aimlessly. The more he walked, the more lively it became. He saw a place where trams were connected in all directions, red and green lights were flashing, and cars were bumper to bumper. The heads of these cars touching the butts of the cars in front of them. The heads of the cars in front were touching the butts of the cars further in front. The perfume of the beautiful girls in the rickshaws and the sweaty smell of the coolies pulling the rickshaws were intertwined, forming a kind of fragrant and stinky odor. The strangest thing was an Indian black carbon gentleman, standing high in the bucket of a flagpole in the center of the road. The country bumpkin thought: He is enjoying the cool breeze in that place, he is truly in his element! He is truly in his element!</p>
<p>Recently, a new type of red electric light, with red, green, and yellow colors, has become popular. When it gets dark, they shine in various colors, and everywhere is lit up. What company are they? What store name is it? You can see it from afar. The red letters are bordered with green, and the yellow letters are bordered with red. The country bumpkin was stunned as he looked. He just kept looking from house to house, and he saw a large building, and there were two red electric lights, very large, shining on the top, which said: "Anti-Occupy."</p>
<p>When the country bumpkin saw it, he felt anger rising from his heart and courage from his liver. He clenched his fists and rushed toward the store, shouting in his mouth:</p>
<p>"Beat! Beat! Beat! Beat that traitor to death! Beat that national scum to death! Beat that cold-blooded animal to death!"</p>

<p>Gold Price Exceeds 700 Taels</p>
<p>A Sharp Increase of 30 Taels and Nine Qian: Yesterday, the gold price suddenly peaked. The storm was still calm, and the advance was sharp but hesitant, resulting in a large rise and small pullback. Throughout the day, there were speculators covering their positions by three to four taels, and in the end, the price rose sharply by more than thirty taels. It rose from the morning, mainly because the silver price fell and, more importantly, because the Japanese troops suddenly retreated from Jinzhou, leading to rising confidence. As a result, many short positions were covered, and large players actively competed to buy. Moreover, foreign exchange was tight, causing the gold price to soar without obstruction, breaking through the 700-tael mark. Subsequently, a new high price of 707.5 taels appeared, and then many sellers seemed to emerge, as those who could profit had already sold. The exchange rate also leveled off slightly, causing the price to drop by ten taels. Later, it returned above 700 taels.</p>
<p>Opening Jump and Subsequent Rise: The price rose by 15.2 qian immediately after opening, reaching 684.5 taels. The near-term silver price remained unchanged from the previous day, while the far-term price rose slightly by one-sixteenth. The silver price fell by one-fourth. As the situation turned calmer, only the Dalian gang was slightly bearish, and the price retreated to 84 taels. In a short time, the price surged by more than ten taels, and Dadecheng, Daxing, Yonghengchang, and Yongyuanmao and others actively competed to buy. The exchange rate also strengthened. It was estimated that the British gold price at the bank was initially 19.8125, then 75, and then rose to 95.5 taels. Then, it fell back by a small amount of four taels as retail investors sold, and then rose again by two or three taels. Yifeng chased up, and the British gold price was posted at a halfpenny decrease, with the US dollar at 94.5 taels. Soon after, Daxing, Yongqiaozhifu, and others sold, and the price fell by more than five taels. In addition, the British gold price for January settlement was 19.6875, followed by 8125 from Taiwan in December, so the price fell to 89.3 qian at 10:00. Afterwards, Yuankangxiang, Yuanyuanmao, Yonghengxing, Cuichang, Yonghengchang, and others bought actively. Because the exchange rate was absorbing the three-month US dollar at 31.8125 yuan, and Maixing was selling British gold at 19.625, then absorbing 5625, the gold price bravely moved forward, with a daily gain, rising by eleven or twelve taels to 700 taels at almost 11:00. The difference was no more than one or two taels. Soon after, Tong Taichang, Qianchangxiang, and many scattered bulls sold off, and the price was suppressed by a little more than four taels, totaling 96.5 taels. In a short time, it rebounded by five or six taels, because the bank was doing two-month British gold at 4375, and HSBC was selling at 375, and the buying sentiment on the table was even stronger. The Dalian gang and Hengchangyong and others jointly competed to buy. After 11:30, Mumbai also reported a small six annas increase, and the market also rose sharply, rising to 702.5 taels. However, Dadecheng and others sold, down three or four taels to 698.8 qian, and immediately rose again to 700 taels, closing at 99.8 qian at noon. Unexpectedly, buyers were active, and the price was pushed up to 704 taels again. Hedgers continued to enter, and the posted price was changed to 774 taels, with a discount of 83 to 84 taels to 73 to 74 taels.</p>
<p>High Point of 707.5 Taels: The market opened after noon, reaching 707 taels, followed by 707.5 taels, because Shunli and Wanxing first delivered, and the goods had already opened up. Afterwards, because the Dalian gang, Tong Taichang, Yuancheng, Yonglai, and others were buying, it immediately retreated by more than five taels, only counting two taels. Suddenly, Yuanyuanmao, Shuizhi, Yongheng, and speculators such as Wu actively entered, and in just seven or eight minutes, the price rose to 5 taels. After this, the exchange market seemed flat, and the bonus could be settled at 31.625 yuan. Banks were doing three-month deals at 75, and the British gold price returned from 19375 to 1950, and hedgers such as Yuanheng, Fuchang, and Xie Kang Yifeng were selling, so the price gradually dropped by as much as eight taels, reaching 697 taels after 1:00. It was heard that Mumbai reported a small twelve annas increase, and the price immediately rose to 701 taels. Only Yifeng, Hengchangyong, Yifengyong, and others were selling. At 3:30, it was 95 taels. After entering, Mumbai returned to two annas, but the gold price was slightly uneasy, until four o'clock when the buyers saw stock movement again, and the British gold was settled at 19.5, and the US dollar at 31.6875, slightly better than before, so it returned to 700 taels. Approaching the closing, it was 700.5 taels, and at 4:30, it closed at 700 taels and 2 qian, and then made to another tael. Compared with last Saturday (according to the posted price), it rose sharply by 30 taels and 9 qian, which can be said to be huge, making it difficult to speculate. According to the daily maximum price of 707.5 taels and the minimum price of 684 taels, there was a difference of 3.5 qian. The goods market opened at 86 taels in the morning, closed at 701 taels at noon, 7 taels in the afternoon, and 1 tael at closing. The discounted price was calculated at 70 taels inside and out, to about 80 taels. Finally, it was 73 to 74 taels, and the books were entered at 703 taels to 700 taels. Bu Shui was at 2 taels, and 3 taels in the afternoon, with a red strip of 5.25 added.</p>
<p>Transactions: Many Buyers: There were many buyers on the table, mostly covering short positions. According to statistics, Yuanmao Yong, Hengchangyong, Yuankangxiang, Yongde, Shenkang, Wanxing, Fuyu, Yifengyong all entered, and Yifeng and Hengxing jointly entered 1200 to 1300 bars. Dadecheng had a total of 40 bars, which were balanced in and out, still entering 100 to 200 bars. Zhifengyong, Shunli, Yuantai, Tongchun, Senchangyong, Dakang, Dacheng, and Yuanchun were very busy in and out. Yu Da, Futaiheng, Tong Taichang, and Qianchangxiang all sold out. Daxing Yong slightly entered, and foreign merchant Qiao Zhifu sold 600 to 700 bars. In the afternoon, Tong Taichang sold 1,000. Yuanmao Yong, Hengyu, Yifengyong, Shunli, and Wanxing entered and sold again. Yifengyong, Yuanxingyong, Dadecheng, and Chengfengyong all entered. Yuanmao Yong, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Minxie Kang, Yuandayong, Taifengcheng, and Yifeng all sold out. Other numbers were mixed in and out. Speculator Wu chased in more than 1,000 bars. The Dalian gang bought 2,000 bars and sold more than 1,000 bars. The Guang gang bought 1,200 bars and sold 600 to 700 bars. It seems that they are now in a bullish position.</p>

<p>Chinese Merchants Rush to Cover Short Positions</p>
<p>Posted Price Reduced by Two Levels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC posted price was reduced by two levels, with the British gold price at a halfpenny reduction to one shilling, nine pence, and twenty-five, and the US dollar at 31 yuan. Hong Kong was still at 76.5625, and the rest followed the reduction. The silver market reported a reduction the day before, but the near-term silver remained unchanged, and the far-term silver rose slightly. However, the market situation was weak, and the transaction price of banks in Shanghai was also tight. It was strong at the beginning, better at noon, and particularly sharp in the early afternoon, but then it returned to level. As a result, compared to the previous Saturday, the British gold was reduced by 6875, and the US dollar was reduced by 1.25 yuan. As for the sudden peak in the gold market, with a new market price of 707.5 taels, it was really because the Japanese troops suddenly withdrew, the situation seemed to ease, and people were in high spirits. Chinese gold merchants had to cover their short positions. It is estimated that there were about 200,000 British gold transactions, and about 1 million and hundreds of thousands of yuan of British gold were transacted. Many banks also did deals with each other. The hedging was around 50 taels in the morning and 53 to 54 taels in the afternoon. The market situation was so sharp that it was unparalleled, it was said.</p>
<p>The British exchange rate fluctuated by 625 throughout the day. The asking price in the morning was about one shilling and ten pence, and the buying price was 0625.

Shanghai sold one month at the same price, and Huabi and North Korea did 8125 together in December. Taiwan sold the same price, Maixing sold 625 for three months, and Sanjing and Maixing did 5625 together. Maixing sold 19.5, and Zhongfa also sold one month at the same price. Sanjing Huabi sold 4375 to HSBC in February, and HSBC sold 375. The noon closing asking price was 4375, and the buying price was half a penny.

<h3 id="e110">Silver Tightness Still Shows No Sign of Weakening <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: The financial sector has been greatly affected by the problem of violent Japanese aggression. Inside, it is already stretched thin. Moreover, some unscrupulous elements are smuggling cash out of the country and withdrawing Chinese deposits to store in foreign banks for protection. Once this kind of suicidal and inferior view is publicized and enters the ears of the public, it will further cause panic in the market. The long-term tightness of the silver supply at this time is not caused by these people.</p>
<p>Box Disassembly Price (Foreign Cents): The early market cent price was 7 qian, 2 fen, 5 li, and 7 hao and a half. The noon market was 7 qian, 2 fen, 5 li, and 3 hao and seven-eighths. As a result, it was smaller by 6 hao and two-eighths than the previous day. (Silver disassembly) The early and noon markets both opened at 4 qian, repeating the previous day.

The trading volume was more than 29,000 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver Cash): Yesterday was Monday, and it seemed that banks received and delivered slightly more than usual. It is estimated that Chinese merchants received and delivered more than 2.9 million yuan of bills, and foreign merchants received and delivered 2.2 million to 300,000 yuan of bills. Secured loan transactions were 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. Various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous expenses totaled 8.8 million to 900,000 yuan. Food intake was 1.4 million yuan. Money shops and silver guild single receipt deliveries were more than 6.4 million yuan. Watermark money deliveries were more than 7.8 million yuan.

<h3 id="e111">The Lowest Interest Rate in Tight Money Conditions <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Last month (November), the tightness of money and the high interest rates were unprecedented. Daily rates hovered around four cents, resulting in a total monthly interest of 11.08 taels. The average daily interest (based on 30 days) was 3 cents, 6.934 li, exceeding October's high of 10 taels by 1.04 taels. Given such high interest rates, the cost of defaulted interest is self-evident. It is anticipated that the proposed interest rate at yesterday's general meeting would be 11.95 taels, with the lowest rate for defaulted interest at 14 to 15 taels and the highest at 16 to 17 taels.</p>

<h3 id="e114">All Bonds Except 96 Suspended from Trading <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 30th), trading in all government bonds at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was extremely sparse. Futures trading was suspended as soon as the market opened in the morning. At the opening, market sentiment was positive, and buying was strong. The disparity between supply and demand caused prices to soar, leading to a suspension of trading in almost all bonds. Except for the Customs Bonds, which were not offered, the 96 bonds were about one yuan away from the limit price. All other bonds had already risen by four yuan compared to the closing price last Saturday. Consequently, only 96 government bonds were traded at the close of the market. Due to the additional margin requirement, trading only resumed after 4 pm, and only in 96 bonds. Even with the suspended bonds, off-market trading continued. The off-market prices remained high due to strong demand, rising considerably above the suspended prices. It was reported that the highest off-market price for Salt Bonds reached 49 yuan in the morning, a level rarely seen recently. The price surge eased slightly in the afternoon, but the actual prices were still about three yuan higher than the suspended prices. The sudden surge in bond prices is attributed to the withdrawal of Japanese troops and the turning of diplomatic circumstances, as well as the exchange's efforts to maintain the market by limiting new sales. The bond market appears promising, and market sentiment has improved. However, it is still too early to be overly optimistic, as the future depends on diplomatic developments. Nevertheless, the securities market has stabilized after this rebound, preventing the instability seen previously. It is expected that today's prices will likely continue to rise, but not as drastically as yesterday's surge and suspension of trading. There were no spot transactions yesterday, and the one-month futures contract did not open. The December futures contract totaled 2,455,000 yuan. Off-market transactions were based on suspended prices, and the amount was not large. The whole six bonds opened and were immediately suspended, with no transactions.</p>

<p>Due to news of the Japanese army's withdrawal, market sentiment has strengthened, and short sellers are uneasy again. A fierce short squeeze has intensified the price surge. However, the financial situation remains tight. Previously, two importers had purchased a significant amount. The positive news triggered a stronger reaction.

<p>Current yarn sales are relatively brisk. According to statistics, various merchants bought a total of 2,800 bales for the day. Fellow merchants bought 700 bales, with prices rising by 1-2 taels. Among the customer merchants, Jiangxi bought 120 bales, Shantou 300 bales, Guangdong 700 bales, inland areas 135 bales, northern merchants 25 bales, and miscellaneous merchants 100 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Cotton Market Price Increase Intensifies <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<h3 id="e121">Cotton Market Strong, Price Increase More Intense <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Due to rumors of the Japanese army's withdrawal and a surge in gold prices, coupled with rising yarn prices, market sentiment is very tense. Retail investors are buying heavily, causing the price increase to intensify. However, actual demand remains inactive, as factories have already absorbed foreign cotton and have no capacity for more. Therefore, major players are still selling on rallies.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Han Brand Up 7-8 Cents <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Han Brand cotton market opened higher in the morning. Due to rising gold prices, buying interest was strong, with prices rising by 7-8 cents for each month. Prices fell slightly by 0.5-1.5 cents in the afternoon. Total trading volume for the day was 115,800 dan. Geng Feng sold 4,000 dan, Yu Da 3,600 dan, Yuan Da 3,800 dan, Xin Cheng 1,500 dan, and Gong Tai 3,100 dan. Chang Ji bought 2,100 dan, Rui Yuan 3,300 dan, Mei Ji 3,400 dan, Yi Cheng 2,800 dan, and Yi Feng 4,600 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Current cotton trading is dull. Factories have no intention to buy, and there are no transactions. Sources include 1,300 bales of Yao cotton and 500 bales of Xia Sha cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Indian Cotton Prices Higher Than American Cotton <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Bombay: Last week's market prices were firm due to low silver prices and limited spot availability. Deliveries were affected by unfavorable weather, and new cotton crops were damaged, leading to a forecast of shortages. However, compared to American cotton, Indian cotton is overpriced, so foreign manufacturers are buying American cotton instead of Indian cotton. Spot prices are firm due to limited arrivals. Exporters are buying Oomra cotton. There were some transactions with China last week. The following is a summary of last week's statistics (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1930　　1931</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts Since September 1　286　　154</p>
<p>Weekend Stock　　　　　　　　　399　　275</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports Since September 1　463　　258</p>
<p>To Europe　　　　　　　　　　　113　　 53</p>
<p>To China　　　　　　　　　　　　92　　 84</p>
<p>Other Regions　　　　　　　　　　4　　 16</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot market activity was quiet last week, and futures were also inactive due to weak yarn prices. Prices showed little movement. Market sentiment was uneasy at the weekend due to disappointment among traders and an announcement of workers increasing working hours. It is generally believed that without positive news from abroad and from Manchester, it will be difficult to improve in the short term. The Egyptian cotton market is very bleak.</p>

<h3 id="e126">River Rice Prices Decline Gradually <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Nantou: Yesterday's arrivals increased, reaching over seventy vessels, with early rice accounting for half. Stockpiles in Pu were also increasing, and urban and rural stores were even more subdued. Tight money conditions and the new japonica rice market are also depressed. Overall, the market is shifted by economic factors, with early rice being plentiful. Spot sales were sporadic, and wholesale activity was minimal. Due to dampness, merchants were eager to sell, causing prices to fall by another 3-4 cents. Imported rice also experienced lackluster sales, causing prices to follow suit.</p>
<p>Xin Zha: Yesterday, due to the end of the lunar month, trading was sparse as firms closed accounts. River shipments totaled about 1,000 shi. According to a survey of river vessels on the Suzhou River up to 4 pm, there were approximately 280 boats around the Shanban Factory, Xinqiao, and Xinlaji Bridge, each carrying about 200 shi of thick new japonica and other indica rice, totaling about 56,000 shi, making it difficult to predict market trends. According to reports from the west, Changshu, Wuxi, Qingpu, and Jiaoli were transporting surplus grain to Shanghai. Therefore, the local market is gradually becoming looser, with thick new japonica and early indica rice falling by 2-3 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Imported Rice Trading is Quiet in Both Futures and Spot Markets <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<h3 id="e128">But Market Sentiment Remains Hopeful <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's imported rice market was even quieter. There were no new transactions. Only the local traders traded 100 tons of small sacks in April futures contracts, priced at 4 taels and 96 cents. Spot prices remained stable, with local traders trading 200 sacks of small sacks at 10 yuan and 2.5 cents. Spot prices remained stable, but futures prices continued to decline. However, market sentiment improved slightly yesterday, as it was reported that Japanese troops in the Northeast and Tianjin were showing signs of withdrawal. As these areas are short of grain, they may place orders in Shanghai. If this happens, the rice market could potentially improve.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Summary of Flour Delivery Last Month <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery date for November flour futures contracts. The actual deliveries for the day included 17,000 bags of Tai Long Green Eagle Globe flour, 12,000 bags of Hua Feng Green Wheat Root flour, and 1,000 bags of Xiang Xin Green Phoenix flour. Given the sharp price drop at the end of the month, it was expected that warehouse receipt deliveries would be substantial, but the market remained quiet, which was unexpected. It is estimated that off-exchange deliveries were no less than 300,000-400,000 bags. Fu Xin and Fu Feng were both taken off the market by customer merchants in advance, or hedging was completed. Hua Feng and Xiang Xin also hedged 60,000-70,000 bags off-exchange, so while the market appeared weak, it was actually still abundant. However, according to yesterday's news, if the Japanese troops actually withdraw and Tianjin can be stabilized, the northern sales market should improve, and market sentiment should turn positive. Futures trading is listed below (in thousands of bags):</p>
<p>November　3,865　　December　3,888</p>
<p>January　4,527　　February　5,588</p>
<p>March　6,198　　April　4,916</p>
<h3 id="e130">23 Truckloads of Wheat Delivered in Futures Market <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that the total delivery volume for November wheat futures was 23 truckloads, delivered by Run De, Ding Tai, Run Chang, etc. These were mainly Shanghai Inland and Jiangbei goods. There were no deliveries of foreign wheat. The buyers were hoarders from the trade. If sales are as strong as flour, the wheat market may be able to hold its ground.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were no new telegrams from the sugar production areas. In the public market, as foreign exchange did not rise and sentiment was better, prices rose repeatedly. No. 14 Dutch Coarse Sand White was quoted at 10.02 taels, but buyers were still watching and offering lower prices, leading to a stalemate. No. 20 Medium Sand White traded slightly at 9.95 taels. No. 8 Dutch Red traded at 8.4 taels, No. 9 at 8.5-8.6 taels, and No. 10 at 8.7-8.75 taels, with frequent transactions. The market situation was very good. Tai Gu sugar prices rose sharply. B Mark rose to 11.8 taels, CW to 11.7 taels, DY Mark to 11.7 taels, HA Mark to 11.6-11.65 taels, and HM Mark to 11.3-11.35 taels. The trend was very good, and the later market was tightening, with further upward potential.</p>

<p>Longkou Vermicelli: Arrivals are very scarce and customer inventory is low. Therefore, the opening price rebounded. Yesterday, the Li Sheng ship arrived with several hundred packages. A certain merchant offered a batch at 23 taels. The previous market price was 22.6 taels, an increase of 4 cents. Retail sales also tightened. It is reported that customer goods have been cleared, and retail inventory is low. The later market may continue to rise.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Piece Goods <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>

<p>Due to tight money conditions, the piece goods market has been declining steadily for several days. The quietness of sales is rare in decades. Frequent foreign troubles, uneasy sentiment, and disaster areas that have not yet recovered have led to a stagnant market for all goods. Imported "Jiao Zhuang" goods have been declining sharply for consecutive periods and are about to be suspended from trading. Six-foot velvet, which was once firm, has fallen by 5 cents to 1 cent per yard. Bleached cloth, Taisiduan satin, and Yuan Yuchou silk are rarely inquired about. Cotton cloth is also soft. Nine-pound cloth has fallen into the two-dollar range. Ten-pound cloth remains firm at 5.15 taels, while 11-pound Caoniu cloth is only 5.225 taels, and Sanmao/Sanlu cloth is 5.275 taels. Fine twill has fallen by 4-5 cents. Fine cloth is firmer in Jin Cheng, but all others are declining. Due to increasing spot inventory, striped velvet is also not as popular as before. Zhigong wool and fine serge remain firm, likely because they are scarce in the market.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Basic Overcoating in Short Supply <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The wool and flannel market has been depressed for a long time. However, basic overcoating is in short supply, and sales of military uniforms for the Volunteer Army have suddenly increased. Therefore, buyers are making every effort to find these items, making the market particularly hot. Yesterday, the price of "Kaisili Luo" brand Yuan Zang goods rose to 1.85 taels. Western clothing shops and military uniform shops made considerable purchases, as their market prices are more affordable than Melton cloth.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Silk and Tea <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign silk market remained depressed. Actual sales of Chinese silk in overseas markets remained stagnant, and European and American hoarders in Shanghai were seeking to suppress prices to accumulate inventory. Due to extremely tight money conditions, it was difficult for Chinese merchants to secure loans and had to sell at a loss. About 50 bales of white silk from Qia He and 30 bales of yellow silk from Sichuan factory were sold, but prices remained depressed. The silk brands sold were not suitable for wide cloth due to their small selling price.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Lu Zhuang Zhen Mei Rises 4-5 Taels <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai foreign tea market, merchants such as Tunxi, Yinxian, Yushan, and other Lu Zhuang Zhen Mei green tea, as well as British companies like Qia He, Xie He, Tong Fu, and Jin Long, continued to search for goods. Trading remained active. The total sales for the city reached over 1,700 boxes. Prices rose slightly by 4-5 taels. There was continued demand for Zhen Jian green tea, etc., from Morocco. However, due to lack of inventory, trading was scarce. Several tea factories that had suspended operations due to strikes have resumed operations.</p>

<p>Trading in new lead wire has been progressing quite well recently, so the market is more active than before. Yesterday, merchants from Hankou and Sichuan jointly purchased 300-400 dan, while merchants from Fujian and inland areas each purchased 100-200 dan. Prices such as No. 16 to No. 20 are selling for 13 taels per dan, and No. 21 to No. 25 are selling for 18.75 taels, which is much firmer than before.</p>

<p>Recently, due to the cold weather, foreign companies and residences are installing stoves, so coal trading has gradually become active. In particular, various types of anthracite coal are selling best, and prices are also good. Yesterday, Datong coal was selling for 17 taels per ton, Kaiping coal for 11 taels, Xiaoshan coal for 13 taels, and Beipiao coal for 14.25 taels.</p>

<p>Wang Jingwei telegraphed Chairman Chiang yesterday, saying: "Respectfully acknowledge Generalissimo Chiang's telegram. The Shanghai meeting first resolved that diplomatic policy and principles should be agreed upon by both parties, and negotiations should be handled by the Nanjing government. If this resolution can be implemented, then diplomatic unity will be achieved without any issues. Regarding party unity, the original intention was for both parties to make concessions and strive for a unified telegram, supplemented by the resolutions on party affairs from the Shanghai meeting. Recently, due to the telegram not being issued, the Guangzhou side has raised objections to the resolutions. After repeated discussions by Comrades Zhesheng, Peiyouren, and Zhan Tangtiyun, remedial measures have been proposed. It is expected that the General Assembly will make a decision soon. In addition to forwarding your telegram to Comrades Zhe and Sheng, I am sending this reply in advance." Wang Zhaoming, 30th.</p>

<p>The military and police authorities in the city, due to rumors that Japanese ronin are colluding with bandits and recruiting unemployed hooligans to disrupt public order, declared special martial law to maintain public order, starting the night before last. Zhabei was the most severely affected. Martial law was declared from 6 pm yesterday until 6 am the next morning. All police officers from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, including those from the district, branch, sub-stations, and police stations, were fully armed. All police officers from the police brigade were also fully deployed and checked pedestrians. Soldiers from the first tax police regiment stationed at the Huzhou Guildhall in Zhabei were armed and on guard, but this was temporary. Martial law will be lifted once the rumors subside. In the Public Concession, the Yangshupu Huishan and other police stations have increased the deployment of a large number of armed Chinese and Western detectives, creating an invisible martial law. This is because the areas under their jurisdiction are where the Japanese live.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Important Remarks by Zhang Qun <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the China East News Agency visited Mayor Zhang yesterday to inquire about various issues such as public security in the city. He gave detailed answers as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Martial Law: Mr. Zhang first stated that the reason for the special martial law in the city the night before last was due to frequent rumors in recent days about Japanese ronin and hooligans plotting to riot. The municipal authorities have repeatedly heard reports of this. On the 27th, it was repeatedly rumored that a large number of ronin and hooligans in the Yangshupu Beisichuan Road area were plotting mischief, and the concession authorities also heard about it repeatedly. Although the municipal authorities have made sufficient arrangements for public security in the city, in view of the proliferation of rumors, it is better to believe that there is a possibility than to believe that there is none. Therefore, martial law had to be implemented as a precaution. According to today's situation, it seems to have eased considerably. Regarding the rumors that the Japanese in Shanghai have already planned something, in my opinion, I believe that the Japanese authorities will not take such absurd actions. However, some ignorant ronin in Japan may be difficult to avoid overstepping the bounds, hoping to provoke major negotiations. However, the municipal authorities have paid close attention to this, and public security in the city will not be affected by unexpected events.</p>
<p>Receiving Commissioner: Mr. Zhang also spoke about the matter of receiving the lost territories of the Northeast. The National Government initially appointed him as the receiving commissioner. At that time, due to the severity of the situation in the city, he telegraphed requesting the appointment of other capable individuals. However, the National Government has not yet approved it. As for the receiving matters, Mr. Gu Weijun had previously convened personnel in Beiping to draft detailed rules, but due to the Japanese side's hesitation and delay, it was never realized. When Mr. Gu initially traveled south from Beiping, he telegraphed to invite me to discuss the matter. I was unable to leave Shanghai at that time, so I did not go to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Stabilizing Finances: Recently, the city has been affected by the current situation, with a shortage of silver and panic in the market. According to Mr. Zhang, the circulating silver in the city, to my knowledge, is about 70 million yuan, and the banknotes of all banks are about 400 million yuan. Due to the impact of the current situation, the public has saved cash, and banks have successively accumulated it, coupled with shipping it abroad to aid other ports. Therefore, panic is inevitable. The municipal authorities have discussed this matter repeatedly, and they believe that stabilizing finances starts with stabilizing public sentiment. As for banning exports, it is actually extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Drawing Lots Today: Mr. Zhang continued to discuss the progress of the city's business, saying that everything is proceeding as usual without any interruption. The second public land lease in the city center will be held today. Regarding the central government's fiscal austerity measures, the city will absolutely not be affected, because the city's economy, although not prosperous, is fortunately able to balance income and expenditure, so it does not feel difficult.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Expected to Arrive in Yokohama in About Five Days <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was ordered by the Ministry of Communications to send the Xin Ming Wheel to Japan to carry overseas Chinese back home. Due to various procedural issues, it finally set sail for Yokohama at 6 pm yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Fully Loaded with Coal and Rice: This time, the Xin Ming Wheel was ordered to go to Japan to carry overseas Chinese. Commissioner Guo Waifeng, because the overseas Chinese were unable to return home, specially prepared 100 shi of rice and a large quantity of vegetables, as well as 300 tons of tap water, as food on board. He also hired a doctor and prepared a large quantity of various medicines for medical assistance, and added a radio operator and a waiter to help the original radio operator, as well as a radio receiver and navigation instruments. Only 480 tons of coal were loaded the day before yesterday. Because the ship was still light, another 120 tons of coal were loaded in the afternoon. The Xin Ming personnel also prepared 50 shi of rice.</p>
<p>Xin Ming's History: The Xin Ming Wheel is the newest type of ocean-going ship in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and has the fastest speed. It was built in 1907 and has a displacement of 2,133 tons. It was ordered to go to Kobe to load Cai Songpo's coffin and return it to China. During the Great Kanto Earthquake in Japan, it sent disaster relief rice to Yokohama. The shipowner is Ma Jiajun, the chief mate is Qian Yujia, the second mate is Zhu Shigao, and the total number of crew members is 160.</p>
<p>Trip to Japan: A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met with Qian Yujia, the chief mate of the Xin Ming Wheel, yesterday to inquire about the trip to Japan. He said that Shanghai to Yokohama is 1,150 nautical miles. The Xin Ming's speed is about 12 nautical miles per hour. If there is no wind or waves, it will take about four and a half days to arrive. For example, if it sets sail at 6 pm today, it will arrive in Moji on the morning of the third day after leaving the Wusongkou and entering the East China Sea. A pilot will be hired to change the course to the Inland Sea and arrive in Bin on the morning of the fifth day. If the overseas Chinese gather in Yokohama, they can return home in Japan in one or two days.</p>
<p>Procedures Completed: At 10 am yesterday, Zeng Guangqing, the director of the business department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, went to the Dalailai Steamship Company on Wuma Road to negotiate, and the Shanghai branch of the Sichuan Road Yamashita Kisen Co., Ltd. was hired as the agent for Xin Ming Yokohama. The special license was issued by the Ministry of Communications to the Jianghai Customs, and it was also issued yesterday. The customs procedures for food, coal, etc. were also completed yesterday.</p>
<p>Telegram to Japan: At 6 pm yesterday, the Xin Ming Wheel set sail from the Jinliyuan Pier in the French Concession. Commissioner Guo Waifeng immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Communications and the Chinese Consul in Yokohama, Mr. Zhou, to take care of the Xin Ming when it arrives in port, and to notify the overseas Chinese to prepare to avoid delays.</p>

<p>Large-scale exports of spot silver from the city have caused extremely tight money conditions, attracting considerable attention from all walks of life. The silver and money industries held a meeting to discuss solutions and believed that the situation was due to the current situation and that banning spot silver exports was practically difficult. The Bankers Association telegraphed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "Respectfully replying to the letter of December 25, which stated (omitted) Please discuss and reply, etc. With regard to the shipment of spot silver to Dalian, from the perspective of the banking industry, our member banks have many branches in Dalian and other ports in North China. In order to adjust the market or due to legitimate business needs, it is inevitable to export spot silver. As for the fear that it may be exploited by the enemy, our association can guarantee that no banks in the association will engage in such behavior. It is hereby replied, and please review and approve it."</p>
<h3 id="e159">Researching the Japanese Troop Withdrawal Issue <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Observations from the National Affairs Research Association</p>
<p>The Association Was Initiated by Academic Circles</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports: Prominent figures from academic circles in Shanghai have initiated a National Affairs Research Association, dedicated to studying foreign affairs from a national perspective. The association also aims to offer its research findings for government adoption. Such organizations are common in Europe and America, and their effectiveness is considerable. Yesterday, during its first preparatory meeting, the association briefly discussed Japan's sudden order to withdraw its troops occupying the three northeastern provinces. The consensus was that this sudden withdrawal is a delaying tactic. Japan is closely allied with France, intending to dominate Europe and America. Even strong opposition from other countries will not make Japan yield. Reports suggesting that Japan withdrew troops due to strong U.S. pressure are untrue. Japan is confident the U.S. will not declare war, allowing Soviet Russia to seize the Pacific's benefits. Japan is actively preparing to declare war on China. Therefore, Japan's troop withdrawal aims to ease international tensions, ensuring the League of Nations' resolution on the Manchurian investigation passes smoothly. Once the investigation team is appointed, Japan will use the pretext of suppressing bandits to redeploy troops. According to European telegrams, Japan's response to the League of Nations' resolution includes several proposed amendments regarding preventative measures. "Although Japan agrees to instruct commanding officers to prohibit troop advances and hostile actions, it must be stipulated that Japanese troops will retaliate if attacked by bandits." This may be part of Japan's diplomatic preparations.</p>

<p>Additional Large Sums Will Be Remitted for Military Expenses</p>
<p>Telegraphing to Inquire About the Best Method for Withdrawal</p>
<p>Since initiating fundraising to support the patriotic soldiers of Heilongjiang Province, the "Life Weekly" has received enthusiastic donations from all sectors. As of the 29th, the total amount reached 80,596.70 yuan. Besides the 55,007 yuan already telegraphed via the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, there remains 25,589.70 yuan. For secure delivery, a telegram was sent to General Ma, inquiring whether the funds could be directly delivered to him if telegraphed through foreign banks in Harbin, or if there were proper procedures to prevent fraudulent claims if personnel were sent to withdraw the funds. The original telegram is recorded below: "To General Ma Zhanshan in Hailun, your previous telegram has been received. The nation admires the General's bravery and loyalty, and is enthusiastically donating to support military needs. Since the launch of our fundraising campaign, enthusiastic comrades have contributed a total of 80,000 yuan. Of which 55,000 yuan has already been telegraphed to Harbin through the Bank of China and Bank of Communications for transfer. We have heard that besides the 4,600 yuan already personally delivered to the General, the remaining amount is still being processed for delivery as the provincial government has moved to Hailun, we are deeply concerned as to whether it has been received or not. There is still 25,000 yuan to be sent from here. We were recently informed by all the officers and soldiers of the Heilongjiang army that future remittances can be sent directly through Citibank, HSBC, and Far Eastern Bank in Harbin. We do not know whether these banks can deliver it directly to the General. If we need to send someone to Harbin to withdraw it, we do not know if there is a proper way to prevent fraudulent claims. We hope for a prompt reply, so that the following remittances can be delivered. We will also telegraph Harbin banks to do the same with the undispatched remittances. Shanghai Life Weekly, deeply concerned."</p>

<h3 id="e162">Youth Aid Ma Group's Grand Parade Yesterday <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Carrying Coffins and Resolving to Die</p>
<p>The Shanghai youth’s self-organized group to go to the Northeast to aid Ma and resist Japan held a demonstration parade at 2:00 PM yesterday. They first gathered at the Public Sports Ground, then set off on the parade. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Participating Groups: Yesterday’s participants included representatives from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the Radio Station, Dongya Physical Education College, Minli Middle School, and various Party and government organs in Shanghai. There were over 400 group members present, all neatly dressed and in high spirits, directed by their respective group leaders, and the order was well-maintained.</p>
<p>Group Leader's Speech: Before the parade set off, the group leader Zhang Shaojie took the stage to give a speech, briefly stating that the Northeast has been occupied for two months, and the soldiers responsible for border defense have repeatedly declared non-resistance, resulting in the unprecedented humiliation of our country. Only General Ma Zhanshan, with his isolated troops, resists the tens of thousands of Japanese soldiers. We should know that the Northeast is the Northeast of all Chinese people, so we cannot sit idly by and watch General Ma fight the Japanese alone. Recently, the League of Nations has shown no hope, the world is dark, and there is no such thing as justice. Therefore, we have organized this group, ready to spill our hot blood all over the Northeast, to reclaim our beautiful country. We deeply hope that the people of the whole country can follow our bloody footprints and advance together to punish the Japanese invaders and establish the foundation of our country.</p>
<p>Parade Situation: After the speech, the parade began, led by the Minli Middle School military band, carrying a coffin to show that they would not return alive until the Japanese invaders were destroyed. The parade route was from Fangxie Road, through Minguo Road, Xiaodongmen, Zhonghua Road, and to the Public Sports Ground in Ximen to disband. The spectators along the way were jammed, and the scene of sadness and excitement was very moving.</p>

<p>Going to Beijing Today to Petition</p>
<p>The Citizens' United Association of this city and the Volunteer Army Committees of each district are sending Wang Pingnan, Liu Zhongying, Wu Banqi, Sun Wenyi, Jiang Junyi, Chen Zemin, and Qiu Jialiang as representatives to Beijing this morning to petition for the immediate dispatch of troops to resist Japan and for the issuance of weapons to the volunteer army. The entire Citizens' United Association, the sub-associations of each district, the National Salvation Volunteer Army of each district, the entire Shanghai West Protection Corps, and the military band will give them a warm send-off.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Declaration of Students from Various Universities <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai University Students' Declaration of Tears Leaving Beijing to Urge the Government to Send Troops, to All Compatriots Transmitted by National Newspapers: Since the atrocities committed by the Japanese bandits on September 18th, the government has repeatedly retreated from its duty to protect the people. Students from various universities in Shanghai, moved by righteousness, formed a team to petition in Beijing in late September. They were assured by Chairman Chiang of the National Government that the lost territories would be recovered in the shortest possible time, and that any further advance by Japanese troops would be resisted with full force. The students, believing that Chairman Chiang, as the head of state, would keep his word, returned to Shanghai and engaged in various activities to support the government. Unexpectedly, more than two months have passed, and not only have the lost territories not been recovered, but the Japanese bandits have become more rampant, and the atmosphere of aggression has intensified. Heilongjiang Province has fallen, and Tianjin and Jinzhou have been successively harassed. However, the government authorities continue to believe in the League of Nations, which has lost all hope, and there is no concrete evidence of sending troops. The students of Shanghai, heartbroken and feeling that the country will be lost soon, could no longer bear it after a long period of silence. They filled out sworn statements and freely organized a group to urge the government to send troops. Under the guidance of the Student Union, they went to Beijing again on the 24th of this month to implore the government to show a resolute determination to send troops with effective guarantees. They endured hardships along the way and finally arrived on the evening of the 25th. On the morning of the 26th, the entire group, with a spirit of extreme order and discipline, petitioned the National Government, waiting all night to see Chairman Chiang. The weather turned cold, the temperature dropped sharply, and it was snowing heavily. Faced with hunger and cold, nearly 200 students fell ill. However, all the members of the group still stood tall in the front yard, their spirits high, shouting slogans to resist Japan and save the country, their voices shaking the mountains. Students from Nanjing and some middle school students from Shanghai also arrived in support, and the number of people increased, but the order became more strict. The newspapers praised them, not to brag about our group. This time, our group was particularly strict about discipline. Before entering the National Government, all members of the group underwent several checks, and any leaflets or propaganda materials were not allowed to be carried. Due to the checking problem, some students had to return to Shanghai with pain. After entering the National Government, the group sent military police to stand guard in various places to check in and out, which was solemn and orderly, which had never happened before. The comrades believed that they would be able to gain some understanding and sympathy from the government officials. However, on the morning of the 27th, the newspapers in Beijing published a conversation with the Secretary-General of the National Government, who surprisingly said that the comrades' trip was clearly being used by others and was deliberately trying to disrupt and insult the National Government. At 2:00 PM, Chairman Chiang personally gave a speech under strict guard, beginning with harsh words accusing them of having ulterior motives, being manipulated by others, deliberately destroying, and insulting the National Government. Alas, the comrades, based on the idea that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world, came to Beijing from thousands of miles away with a sincere heart to plead for the suffering compatriots in the Northeast and for the country that is in danger. They did not count the fatigue of the journey. They stood in the front yard of the National Government for two days and one night, enduring hunger, cold, and illness. The result was being slandered. At this point, the comrades did not dare to suspect that the revolutionary government would use the methods of the former warlords to suppress the patriotic movement to suppress the comrades. However, the comrades' sincere loyalty was not understood by the government. They asked themselves and were extremely sad. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang had made concrete expressions of his determination to send troops, and the Shanghai Student Union sent a telegram urging them to return. Therefore, the comrades returned to Shanghai in an orderly manner on the evening of the 28th. However, the comrades are citizens, and if the brutal bandits are not eliminated for a day, the comrades' responsibility to save the country will not be fulfilled for a day. They should stick to their original intentions and continue to struggle. The resting place is near, and they will never forget it. They also hope that the patriotic compatriots across the country will pity and teach them. This is the declaration.</p>

<p>Japanese in Eastern Provinces are Indirectly Spreading Propaganda</p>
<p>The National Christian Council of China, located at 23 Yuanmingyuan Road in Shanghai, is jointly organized by Chinese churches across the country. It recently read the Eastern Three Provinces Gazette, which contained a statement from the All-Manchuria Christian Youth League to the League of Nations opposing the news of Japan's troop withdrawal. The association was investigating the matter when it received a letter from the Shenyang China Christian Council of Kwantung Conference (an organization uniting Chinese churches in the Eastern Provinces), stating that on November 18, the Eastern Three Provinces Gazette published a statement from the All-Manchuria Christian Youth League to the League of Nations, opposing Japan's troop withdrawal and stating the necessity of Japanese troops in Manchuria. The signatories were the Fengtian Christian League, Fengtian Congregational Church, Fengtian Japanese Christian Church, Fengtian Anglican Church, and the Fengtian Salvation Army Corps Leader. These were all Japanese organizations in the Eastern Provinces and had no connection with Chinese churches, and the Chinese churches were completely unaware of it beforehand. This is clearly a form of indirect propaganda by the Japanese, intended to confuse people. It is reported that the association has presented this case to the executive committee for discussion after receiving the letter.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Reply from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Overview of Economic Severance with Japan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in response to a letter from the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association of Allen Ni Lowa Province, Philippine Islands, inquiring about the domestic economic severance with Japan, replied in detail yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, we received your letter of the 28th of this month, requesting us to show one or two aspects of the domestic anti-Japanese movement. The domestic anti-Japanese movement can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) Economic severance with Japan, the main points of which are not to import Japanese goods, not to take Japanese ships, and to sever all economic relations with the Japanese. The Japanese goods imported by various industries have been decided to be sealed up and not allowed to be sold. After the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has accurately counted all the Japanese goods in stock, it will determine the disposal method. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association is a joint organization of all sectors, and each industry has also established a Japanese goods inspection group, which cooperates with the Anti-Japanese Association to handle inspection matters. For goods from European and American countries shipped to China, our association has also sent letters to the Shanghai chambers of commerce of various countries, requesting them not to load Japanese ships. Since the implementation of economic severance with Japan, the Japanese shipping industry in China has been hit the hardest. Many factories set up by the Japanese in Shanghai have closed down. However, the large yarn factories are still trying their best to support, but with stockpiles of goods, they have also decided to stop production when it is unavoidable. (2) Training the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Army. This volunteer army is organized by people from all walks of life. The chairman of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has formed three regiments. The commercial groups that organize independently are handled by the trade associations, but they must register with the Anti-Japanese Association in order to be unified. The schools are organized by government-appointed instructors and are called the Youth Volunteer Army and do not belong to the Anti-Japanese Association. (3) Donating to the Heilongjiang military expenses. Since the invasion of the Japanese bandits, only Ma Zhanshan, the chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, has directed the resistance against the enemy, supporting it for half a month, and was trapped due to the exhaustion of food and supplies. Now he is retreating to Hailun, still planning to revive. Therefore, our association has launched a donation campaign, and all sectors have responded. The amounts remitted successively have reached hundreds of thousands. Thank you for your attention, and we hereby provide a summary for your reference."</p>
<h3 id="e167">Letter from the Ratepayers' Association to the Municipal Council <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Patriotic Actions Should Be Understood</p>
<p>Undue Interference Should Not Be Applied</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ratepayers' Association of Chinese Nationals wrote to the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, we have received a letter from the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association stating that recently, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police have often obstructed the association's staff from performing their duties within the concession, sending them to court, etc., which has had a profound and significant impact on the future of the patriotic movement. It is important to know that since its establishment, the association has been dedicated to anti-Japanese national salvation as its purpose and is entrusted by all the citizens. Matters related to the patriotic movement, any Chinese person has a patriotic heart and would not arbitrarily destroy it. Moreover, the association's inspectors carry out their inspection duties in accordance with the association's regulations, wearing badges and staff certificates with their photos attached for identification. The inspection procedures are also carried out in accordance with the prescribed procedures and have been announced in the newspaper. Since its establishment, there have been no reports of disturbing public order. The police station, etc., have taken the above actions, which is regrettable. We hereby request your association to uphold justice and forward a letter to the Municipal Council, ordering all police stations to no longer engage in the above actions and to respect the patriotic movement." It is understood that Japan relies on its military force to invade our territory, violating international conventions and undermining world peace. The people and governments of all civilized countries recognize it as a poisonous snake and beast of humanity. Even its naval landing force relies on barbarism to land and act recklessly. Those responsible for maintaining public order tolerate it and dare not treat it with the methods used to treat our country's armed soldiers. However, the people of our country, on the one hand, must maintain the integrity of our country's sovereignty, and on the other hand, must maintain world peace, so they use non-violent methods to implement economic severance. This kind of behavior is not only a duty that the citizens should fulfill, but also indicated by Article 16 of the covenant observed by the more than fifty countries in the people's concession. It is remembered that once, the Japanese Marine Corps occupied a police station because the Public Concession detained one of its law-breaking Marine Corps members in the police station, and the matter was settled after the authorities apologized. Based on this, it can be seen that military force can destroy the law, and the authorities dare not compare with it, and instead apologize to it. However, for those who resist this kind of military force that destroys public law and invades our country's territory with non-violent economic severance to seek self-defense, undue interference is applied, and it is justified with the covenant and criminal law. This association believes that this kind of action does not sanction military force, but creates more and more military force. Those who are responsible for maintaining the law and order are only subject to the barbarism of the Japanese Marine Corps. What this association hopes from your council is that you should not fear the tyranny of military force, and you should understand the non-violent patriotic movement. In accordance with the reason in the letter, we hereby send this letter, hoping that you will investigate and handle it accordingly."</p>

Instead, this bond was pledged to three banks for a loan of 12 million yuan to meet urgent needs. The loan has been delivered successively, but no commercial banks have participated, so the bond certificates have not actually been issued.</p>

<p>Divorced Concubine in Litigation</p>
<p>Husband and Concubine Can Break Off Relations</p>
<p>Mother and Son Absolutely Cannot</p>
<p>Shen's Concubine Sues for Return of Three Sons</p>
<p>Willing to Raise Them to Avoid Abuse</p>
<p>Cheng Yuzhen, a woman from Suzhou, is 23 years old. Eight years ago, she hung up a sign in Shanghai to work as a prostitute, named "Little Brother." In the 12th year of the Republic of China, Cheng suddenly became involved with a patron, Shen Yanling, the current comprador of the British merchant Sassoon &amp; Co. (the son of Shanghai's famous figure Sassoon A-Si), and soon married Cheng as his concubine. After Cheng and Shen lived together, they had three sons in total: the eldest, Gongji, is currently six years old, the second, Gongwei, is four years old, and the youngest, Gongjie, is only two years old. By the autumn of this year, Cheng and Shen had disagreements. After several negotiations, they broke off their relationship and made a contract. Article 2 of the contract stated that Cheng's maternal status and all legal rights to her three biological sons were forever forfeited. Afterwards, Cheng hired two lawyers, Zhu Sifu and Jiang Yiping, to sue Shen in the First Special Court, requesting that Article 2 of the contract be declared invalid. The reason was that Shen knew that Cheng Yuzhen had lost her education at a young age and did not understand literature, and that he had not obtained Cheng's consent, nor had he invited Yuzhen's agent lawyer Zhu Sifu to the scene to testify, so Article 2 of the contract could not be valid. After the trial judge Yang Yi ruled that "the agreement between the two parties to separate was confirmed, and the part of Article 2 concerning the loss of the plaintiff's maternal status and all legal rights to Gongji, Gongwei, and Gongjie was invalid." The reasons for the ruling were that the combination of the plaintiff and the defendant could be dissolved by contract, but the relationship between mother and son was a natural combination, not created by contract, nor could it be eliminated by contract. Moreover, there was no reason for a son to sever relations with his mother, and their maternal status could not be eliminated due to the separation of the family. As for all legal rights between mother and son due to the maternal relationship, they would naturally follow their identity and could not be deprived. Moreover, the plaintiff's relationship with her three sons was not something that the defendant could freely dispose of. The defendant, based solely on his own or his concubine's intentions, completely disposed of the plaintiff's maternal relationship, which was directly using the status of a third party as the object of their disposal, which was not in accordance with the law or human sentiment. This kind of contract violated good morals and could hardly be considered valid. Since this case was ruled in favor of Cheng Yuzhen, Cheng still hired lawyers Zhu Sifu and Jiang Yiping to file a suit with the Mediation Office of the First Special Court, suing Shen and requesting mediation, ordering Shen to hand over the three thousand to the petitioner Cheng Yuzhen for self-support. The petition stated that Article 2 of the contract signed by the petitioner and Shen had been declared invalid by the court. Now it has been found that Shen and his wife have angered the sons born to her because they have not won the lawsuit with the petitioner, and often abuse them. His wife, who still has the ability to bear children, is determined to put Gongji and others to death. The petitioner is still alive, how can she sit idly by and watch her own children being bullied? Moreover, the relationship between mother and son is rooted in nature, and there is no reason to not save them in times of danger. For this reason, she has no choice but to petition the court to summon her case for mediation, ordering the respondent to hand over Gongji, Gongwei, and Gongjie, who were born to the petitioner, to the petitioner for self-support. The case concerns the lives of four mothers and sons, and she begs that you summon her for inquiry soon. The court, based on the statement, summoned the mediation in the ninth court by judge Li Mo yesterday morning. However, Shen Yanling did not appear as summoned. Judge Li then declared that there was no way to mediate, and informed the plaintiff's lawyer Li that if the respondent Shen Yanling did not report to the court within five days, it should be considered that the mediation had failed and that a formal lawsuit could be filed separately.</p>

<p>The First Special District Court of Jiangsu Shanghai replied to the Shanghai Real Estate Association, stating: "Dear Sir, we have received your letter regarding the request for instructions from Xielong Company on the matter of adding insurance for tenants renting houses. If it is stipulated by laws and regulations that renting a house must add insurance, both the landlord and the tenant should comply with it. However, this matter originally belonged to the procedures that the parties to the contract should have at the beginning of the lease. If the tenant does not agree to add insurance, the landlord should not be allowed to refuse the lease. If the lease contract has already been established, and it is considered that the tenant still needs to add insurance at this time, the landlord should directly negotiate with the tenant to handle it. We approve of the letter before, and we should reply accordingly, hoping for your reference."</p>

<p>Resumed Normal Sailing Yesterday</p>
<p>The Company Discussed Security Issues Yesterday</p>
<p>The Dada Company's Tongyang line steamer, the Dade, was robbed by bandits near Liuweigang, Tongzhou. Passengers were greatly frightened at the time. The purser, Li Yousan, was initially kidnapped but later released. Fortunately, there were no major losses. The ship returned to Shanghai at 3 PM the day before yesterday. After inspection by the company, it resumed passenger service yesterday morning at a little past 12 AM, setting sail for Yangzhou. For the safety of passengers, the company discussed security measures yesterday to prevent future incidents.</p>
<p>Ningbo native Weng Ajiao, also known as Shi Aqiao, was chopped to death by enemies leading more than ten accomplices with axes, on the upper floor of the east wing of Yan Boying's house at No. 10 Chuqing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, French Concession, at 8:45 PM on the 17th of last month. The body was reported and examined by the Second Special District Coroner, and collected for burial pending the police's investigation and arrest of the murderers, as previously reported. The French Concession Police Special Intelligence Supervisor Jin Jiulin, Investigator Li Yaolong, Deputy Investigators Qian Yumin, Mao Jingen, and Zhang Ziying, etc., discovered that the murderers were hiding in the Tongfu Teahouse at No. 651 Chengdu Road, Public Concession. At 9 AM yesterday, they led the patrol team, together with the Chinese and Western detectives in charge, to the teahouse to arrest ax gang members Zhang Ruiting, also known as Zhang Gezi, from Yangzhou, and Xiao Guifang from Zhenjiang. They also arrested accomplice Zheng Shuang'er at No. 84 Xinzha Road. At Zhang Ruiting's house at No. 634 Yuqing Lane, Chengdu Road, they confiscated an ax and brought them back to the police station.

He also ordered the patrol detectives to strictly apprehend the fugitive criminals and leader for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Large Batch of Relief Clothing Consumed by Fire <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The God of Fire Harasses Disaster Victims</p>
<p>A vacant house at No. 138 to No. 140 Caishi Street, Dongxinqiao, French Concession, with a second and third floor filled with a large batch of relief clothes, cotton-padded jackets and trousers, stored by a nearby clothing store, suddenly caught fire at 8:30 PM last night. Thick smoke billowed out, immediately piercing the roof. The fire was very intense and spread to the adjacent Yongfeng Egg Store at No. 136. Fire brigades from various sections rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm, making great efforts to draw water and douse the flames. It was extinguished after some time. However, the second and third floors of the house were completely destroyed, and most of the relief clothes were turned to ashes.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Su Yingjie <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Sued by Concubine for Neglecting Support</p>
<p>Su Yingjie, the principal of the Nanshi Municipal Middle School, and his concubine Gu Shanbao, had separated last year due to differences in opinion, with lawyers providing proof. It is said that the issue of money has not been settled. In June of this year, Su Gu Shanbao filed a petition to the mediation office of the local court, requesting alimony, but the proceedings were not resolved because Su Yingjie did not appear. Gu Shanbao has now hired lawyers Jin Yu and Liu Shiqi to file a lawsuit in the local court on behalf of her 12-year-old son Su Zuliang, with Shanbao as the legal guardian, accusing Su Yingjie of abandonment and neglect of support. The objectives are: (1) Defendant Su Yingjie should pay a lump sum of 6,000 yuan in alimony. (2) Defendant should pay 600 yuan for Zuliang's three years of tuition and 1,180 yuan for three years of living expenses. The statement roughly stated that after plaintiff Shanbao met the defendant in the eighth year of the Republic, they fell in love and lived together, and subsequently had a son named Zuliang. Later, the defendant's wife died, and she took over the household. Unexpectedly, the defendant later took in another concubine, leading to constant disputes and unrest. The later concubine was young and beautiful, and engaged in contention for affection, and constantly slandered her. The plaintiff was not good at flattery, and was preoccupied with household affairs, and appeared more haggard. The defendant found the plaintiff old and undesirable, and abandoned her like a worn-out shoe, only allowing the plaintiff to live with her mother because she had borne a son. Before the plaintiff returned to her mother's house, the defendant promised to pay 50 yuan per month for alimony, and the defendant would also pay for the clothing and tuition fees for the plaintiff and her son. The plaintiff hoped that he would change his mind, so she obeyed and left. Unexpectedly, the defendant only paid the alimony in full for the first few months, and then stopped paying the checks, and procrastinated when she asked for payment, and this has been going on for four years. The livelihood of the mother and son has been maintained entirely by the plaintiff. The defendant has not asked about it, and they are like strangers. Last year, she entrusted lawyer Chao Kun to recover the principal and interest of the deposit from the defendant, but the defendant ignored it, and she had no choice but to file a lawsuit. The defendant Su Yingjie also hired lawyer Jiang Baolian to defend him. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Run specially opened the eighth court to hear the case. Both parties were absent, and only the lawyers appeared in court. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the plaintiff's age, roughly stating that the plaintiff Su Gu Shanbao was 31 years old and from Suzhou, and stated the previous events. He also said that the elder son of the first wife, Zu Hua, also recognized the plaintiff as his stepmother, and that Zuliang was studying in Suzhou, and the defendant also came forward. Next, the defendant's lawyer stated that the defendant Su Yingjie was 58 years old, from Shanghai, and lived in a private school. The plaintiff was not recognized as the first wife, and the son Zuliang was indeed born to the plaintiff, but previously, lawyer Chao Kun had mediated a settlement, and they had separated. The judge stated that both parties must be present in person for the case to be reviewed, and adjourned the court.</p>
<p>Zhang Weiliang and Wife Reconcile</p>
<p>Reconciliation Terms Agreed Upon in Court</p>
<p>Zhang Weiliang, a dentist at No. 9 Hankou Road, Jiangxi Road, met Dong Meizhen, a top student from the Patriotic Girls' School, in the twelfth year of the Republic. At that time, Dong was only twenty-three years old and unmarried, while Zhang was three years older and also single. A woman waiting for marriage is easily tempted by a gentleman. They began with friendly interactions and after a year, they found each other very affectionate. Dong then requested a formal marriage to establish their status, but Zhang refused a ceremony, saying that his family was old-fashioned and his mother did not approve of free love. They lived together without a matchmaker. Later, Zhang's mother knew about it and did not object. Seven years have passed, and their love gradually faded. Zhang's mother was still unhappy that this daughter-in-law had not been formally married and often told her son that she would find another good wife for him, which made Zhang unable to devote himself to Dong. Last year, Dong's niece came to live with the Zhang family, and Zhang was envious of her youth and beauty and wanted to take advantage of her. However, Dong was watching closely, and he could not get started. Recently, when the girl got married, Dong had to send a gift, but Zhang was jealous and refused to give anything. Then Dong and Zhang had a conflict, and Zhang's mother took the opportunity to stir up trouble, so Zhang's determination to remarry became stronger. Dong learned that the wedding date had been set and feared that once it was realized, she would be abandoned. She hired a lawyer to petition the First Special District Local Court, requesting mediation to prevent Zhang from remarrying and to continue living together. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Zhou Daren specially opened a mediation court. Both parties were present. Many of Dong's classmates were in the audience, and the eighth courtroom was filled with women. Judge Zhou first asked Dong Meizhen about the course of their relationship and the origins of the current conflict, then asked Zhang Weiliang what the nature of his cohabitation with Dong was. Zhang said that it was from friendship to marriage, and if he wanted to continue living together, she had to be respectful to his mother and listen to his commands. Dong expressed complete acceptance of the two points Zhang said. Judge Zhou then drafted the reconciliation terms: Zhang Weiliang was willing to continue living with Dong Meizhen as husband and wife and would not remarry. Dong Meizhen was willing to obey Zhang Weiliang's reasonable commands and get along with Zhang Weiliang's mother, otherwise, they would resolve it according to law and remarry. Both parties expressed satisfaction and signed successively, and then reconciled.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Tang Min Accuses <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Shen Zuwang of Fraudulent Marriage and Abuse</p>
<p>Requests 30,000 Yuan in Alimony</p>
<p>Tang Min (aka Muying), a Zhejiang woman with higher education, recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court against Shen Zuwang for fraudulent marriage, abuse, and theft of dowry, requesting a divorce, the return of the dowry, compensation for damages, and 30,000 yuan in alimony. It is reported that the case will be heard in the civil court on the 2nd of this month. The general idea of her statement is that in August of last year, the defendant entrusted Ms. Deng Baozhen to propose marriage, saying that his first wife had died, that he was extremely honest, had no vices, and worked at the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange, and that they were well-matched. The plaintiff believed this to be true and agreed to the marriage. They married in October. Unexpectedly, after the defendant saw that his scheme had succeeded, he pursued his original intention of stealing the dowry. He used various means to forcibly take away the plaintiff's various ornaments such as pearl hairpins, necklaces, beads, emeralds, diamonds, etc. In February of this year, when the plaintiff went to Hangzhou to visit her relatives, he secretly opened the plaintiff's suitcase, and when the plaintiff returned to Shanghai, she realized that the jewelry and other ornaments stored in the suitcase were gone. When she asked him for it, she was beaten by his mother, and he colluded with his unmarried sister, Shen Lingwan, to abuse her together, constantly scolding and beating her, which led to chronic illness. The defendant also constantly provoked fights and beatings. She was already sick in bed, but could not withstand the beating, which caused her to cough up blood and become unconscious, her life in danger. The defendant saw that the ornaments had been stolen and treated the plaintiff inhumanely. Recently, it was learned that he was wandering outside day and night, smoking opium, and had no legitimate occupation. His first wife, Ms. Yuan Cuifang, is still alive. She divorced last time due to abuse and did not die of illness. This shows the darkness of his family and the maliciousness of his intentions.</p>

<p>Employee Accused of Embezzling Funds</p>
<p>Sentenced to One Year in Prison and Fined 500 Yuan</p>
<p>Chao Kuixiang, a native of Changzhou who was an employee in the Hongkou branch of the Yong'an Savings Department at No. 501 North Sichuan Road, was found by accountant Wang Jiguang to have discrepancies in his accounts from September of the year before last to last year. When asked, Chao admitted to temporarily using the money and promised to repay it in installments. As a result, his monthly salary of 40 yuan was deducted, and the matter was not pursued. Unexpectedly, he was unable to make up the shortfall, and avoided going to the bank to work for about three weeks. The Hongkou police were informed and sent detective Feng Qi to find him at No. 20 Yongshou Cemetery on Fangbang Road in the Chinese district the day before yesterday. He was brought to the police station. He admitted that most of the embezzled funds, totaling 8,400 yuan, were deposited in the Yuankang Qianzhuang on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, but the bank had already closed. Yesterday morning, the police sent Chao to the First Special Court's Criminal Division. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the plaintiff had already filed a lawsuit against Yuankang Zhuang in the First Special Court of the French Concession. The defendant, the police, admitted to embezzling a total of 11,000 yuan and returning more than 1,000 yuan. The plaintiff's incidental civil suit must wait until the Second Special District's lawsuit is over before it can be concluded. Wang Jiguang, the representative of the plaintiff, Yong'an Savings Department, stated the previous events and presented the accounts for inspection through a lawyer. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he had been confused for a moment and had been fooled by others. Judge Xiao Xie□ reviewed the confession and sentenced Chao Kuixiang to one year in prison and fined him 500 yuan. If the fine is converted into imprisonment, it will be calculated at two yuan per day. The incidental civil suit was transferred to the Civil Division of this court for trial. The defendant also has a civil lawsuit in the Second Special Court, which is scheduled to be heard on the afternoon of December 4. The police are allowed to send detectives to send the defendant for questioning.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau issued Public Notice Zheng No. 26 yesterday, stating, "Received Municipal Government Order No. 10428, approving the Chinese Boy Scout Headquarters Letter No. 6346, according to the Shanghai Boy Scout Council report stating that recently in Shanghai, numerous bands and small temple names have been found employing ignorant young children, wearing Boy Scout uniforms, to perform funeral and wedding services, obscuring society, and that while this behavior does not merit the notice of those in the know, it has a bearing on the future development of the Boy Scouts. Therefore, the board of directors decided at the second regular meeting to request that the headquarters issue a clear order to ban this activity, for the sake of the public. Accordingly, we respectfully submit this document to your department, hoping that you will examine it, quickly ban this activity, and serve the public interest. Based on this, we find that Boy Scout uniforms are of great importance. If ignorant people are allowed to imitate and wear them at will, it will not only hinder the uniformity of Boy Scout uniforms, but also cause incidents and damage the reputation of the Boy Scouts. We should write to your municipal government, ordering your subordinates to strictly ban this activity to protect the development of the local Boy Scout movement, for the sake of the Party. We have approved this, and in addition to sending a letter in reply, we should order the bureau to immediately comply with it, ordering the subordinates to strictly ban this activity. This notice is hereby issued. You must comply with it within one month. If you delay deliberately, you will be severely punished."</p>

<p>A Branch Opened in Baxianqiao</p>
<p>Both Scheduled to Open Today</p>
<p>The China Travel Service at No. 114 Sichuan Road in this city has always aimed to serve the public and facilitate travel. In addition to opening branches in major commercial ports in the country, it has recently decided that Wuhu is an important port on the Yangtze River and that it is necessary to add a branch. It has specially dispatched staff to prepare for it. After a month, a branch has been opened in the Shanghai Bank on Jinbao Street in Wuhu, scheduled to open on December 1. It will sell tickets for various Yangtze River ships without charging a handling fee and will have uniformed attendants at the pier to take care of everything. The company, considering the vast area of this city, has also opened a branch in the Shanghai Bank in Baxianqiao, in addition to setting up a branch in Jing'an Temple Road in West Shanghai and an office in Hongkou, to facilitate travel for residents of the French Concession. It will also sell tickets for various vehicles and ships, also scheduled to open today (December 1).</p>
<h3 id="e183">Candle Industry Petitions for Correction of Stamp Tax on Gift Certificates <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Candle Industry Association, on behalf of its member Mao Yuyuan Company, whose twelve gift certificates (candle tickets) were seized by the stamp tax inspector, and the Public Security Bureau immediately imposed a heavy fine, believes that this action violates the regulations promulgated by the Ministry. The association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it be forwarded to the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau for correction in accordance with the law, in order to eliminate malpractices and avoid disputes. The original text is recorded as follows: "Presented for the purpose of requesting the Shangbao Stamp Tax Branch to correct the illegal seizure of gift certificates issued by commercial firms, and the dispatch of the same to the Public Security Bureau for punishment, in order to prevent future malpractices and disputes. It is reported that the association's inspectors took twelve gift certificates (candle tickets) and immediately dispatched them to the First District Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which ordered a fine of 30 yuan to be paid within three days, an erroneous measure. We request that the matter be forwarded for relief. Since the incident occurred, the members have been panicked and continue to appeal to the association, believing that the candle tickets issued by candle shops are like the gift certificates issued by banks and companies. For example, if a customer buys a catty of candles, they first pay for a catty of candles, then the shop fills out a ticket, affixes a stamp according to the amount, and hands it over to the customer. When the customer needs candles, they bring the candle ticket to the shop to exchange for candles. This candle ticket is actually the same as the goods. Now the branch believes that the candle ticket is not affixed with a stamp and considers it a violation of the stamp tax regulations. It is as if when merchants sell goods, they must not only affix stamps to the invoice, but also affix a stamp to each item. The issuance of species tax tickets (for soda and foreign wine). However, the candle industry is not included. Now the branch distorts the Ministry's documents, imposes fines on merchants at will, and if this bad precedent is set, it will not only harm the industry but also disrupt commerce. The most team-oriented organization should be asked to open a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Commerce Transport Institute, find a way to correct it, and for this, we request the Qian Council to quickly forward it to the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau, ordering the branch to immediately correct it to eliminate malpractices and avoid disputes. This is truly for the public good."</p>

<h3 id="e189">Domestic Newspapers Request Tax Exemption <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Domestic newspapers manufactured by Tianzhang Paper Mill and others are purchased in large quantities in Fujian and Xiamen, but the tax burden is inevitably heavier. The Fujian Provincial Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods has petitioned the Ministry of Finance to approve the exemption of domestic newspapers from all taxes to show support. The petition reads: "For the matter of petitioning, the paper required by various newspapers in our country has always been taken from foreign goods. The leakage is huge and shocking. I have found that the Shanghai factory already has domestic products that are excellent, suitable, and no less than imported goods. However, our domestic products have been subject to customs restrictions for many years, resulting in heavy costs and difficulty in promotion. If we do not urgently seek to save them, it will be difficult for domestic goods to compete with foreign goods. The way to save them lies in the government's practical assistance and special awards, so that domestic products can make great progress and benefit both the national economy and people's livelihood. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, together with the three ministries of Railways, Communications, and Finance, presented and approved by the Executive Yuan in the 19th year of the Republic of China, listed the machine-made paper industry in Article 2 of the Provisional Standards for Examination of Special Industrial Awards, and in Article 5, it stated that according to the provisions of Article 2 of this Law, materials may be subject to reduced transportation costs or tax exemptions, all limited to domestic goods, but important materials without domestic production may also be subject to appropriate reductions and exemptions. Then, the aforementioned domestic newspapers are machine-made and completely domestic goods. The Department should approve the tax exemption, in order to show excellence. The association, in order to promote the promotion of domestic goods and save the country, should prepare a document for inspection and verification. Please implement it, and please instruct and comply."</p>

<p>The Women's National Salvation Grand Alliance of this city telegraphed Nanjing yesterday to Ms. Soong Mei-ling, Niu Youheng, and others, saying: To Madam Soong Mei-ling, Niu Youheng, Ma Shucheng, Zhang Mojun, Bao Zhining, Yi Xiang, Tao Xuan, and other ladies, your telegram is respectfully received. Your common hatred of the enemy and heartfelt words are deeply admired. However, it is an overestimation to worry about the lack of consolation funds. Who does not like doing good deeds as much as I do? In a storm and a dangerous boat, our souls and bodies should all be dedicated to the country, especially when everyone is working together, and there are ladies like you responding from high places. The colleagues here are organizing a group to comfort the soldiers who are protecting the country and are hereby informed. I hope that everyone will work together with one heart and one mind to overcome the difficulties of the times. The Women's National Salvation Grand Alliance respectfully bows.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Domestic Newspapers Request Tax Exemption <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Domestic newspapers manufactured by Tianzhang Paper Mill and others are purchased in large quantities in Fujian and Xiamen, but the tax burden is inevitably heavier. The Fujian Provincial Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods has petitioned the Ministry of Finance to approve the exemption of domestic newspapers from all taxes to show support. The petition reads: "For the matter of petitioning, the paper required by various newspapers in our country has always been taken from foreign goods. The leakage is huge and shocking. I have found that the Shanghai factory already has domestic products that are excellent, suitable, and no less than imported goods. However, our domestic products have been subject to customs restrictions for many years, resulting in heavy costs and difficulty in promotion. If we do not urgently seek to save them, it will be difficult for domestic goods to compete with foreign goods. The way to save them lies in the government's practical assistance and special awards, so that domestic products can make great progress and benefit both the national economy and people's livelihood. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, together with the three ministries of Railways, Communications, and Finance, presented and approved by the Executive Yuan in the 19th year of the Republic of China, listed the machine-made paper industry in Article 2 of the Provisional Standards for Examination of Special Industrial Awards, and in Article 5, it stated that according to the provisions of Article 2 of this Law, materials may be subject to reduced transportation costs or tax exemptions, all limited to domestic goods, but important materials without domestic production may also be subject to appropriate reductions and exemptions. Then, the aforementioned domestic newspapers are machine-made and completely domestic goods. The Department should approve the tax exemption, in order to show excellence. The association, in order to promote the promotion of domestic goods and save the country, should prepare a document for inspection and verification. Please implement it, and please instruct and comply."</p>

<p>Collision of Two Ships: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiahe" vessel, en route from Shanghai to Yingkou to load cargo, dropped anchor upon arrival in Yingkou port. Due to tidal wave surges, the Jiahe's anchor chain dragged behind the ship. Coincidentally, the company's "Taishun" vessel also arrived in Yingkou, attempting to cross the channel, and struck the Jiahe's anchor chain. The Taishun's bow then violently collided with the Jiahe's port side, causing a large hole above the waterline, measuring one foot above and seven feet wide between the seams. The second-deck platform was also destroyed. The Taishun repeatedly collided three times, causing the Jiahe to run aground after the damage. Subsequent investigation revealed extensive losses. The Jiahe's owner telegraphed Shanghai to report the incident and requested the Yingkou branch to prepare materials for repairing the breach. A warning was also issued to all vessels entering Yingkou port to avoid the Jiahe's grounded location. The ship is currently undergoing salvage efforts.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping: Following the Tianjin Incident, various shipping companies in Shanghai received telegrams from Tianjin stating that it was extremely dangerous for merchant ships to load and unload cargo in Tianjin. Consequently, all cargo transport from Shanghai to Tianjin was suspended. As of yesterday, the shipping companies received further telegrams from Tianjin indicating that while the crisis in Tianjin had not completely subsided, the situation had slightly improved. Chinese ships arriving in Tianjin mostly unloaded cargo at Tanggu. Those entering the port berthed along the Bund within the British concession, ensuring the safety of passengers. However, all passenger services have been suspended, and no goods are being exported from Tianjin. Currently, only one Chinese merchant ship is operating between Shanghai and Tianjin.</p>

The aim is to first understand the general situation to facilitate unified relief efforts. In addition to issuing instructions to various provincial governments and civil affairs departments, the survey form is enclosed for your city government's reference.

<p>The Shanghai National News Agency has been established for eight years. It was initially the Shanghai propaganda arm of the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters, with Shao Ji'ang as its director. In the winter of 1926, He Weixin took over. After the April 1927 purge, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters sent Zhang Jinglu to take over, with Chen Dezheng serving as director.

<p>Letter from Chairman of Tobacco Factories Association to Chairman of Colored Printing Industry Association: Greetings. Our member companies, Huacheng and Huada Tobacco Companies, experienced delays in the distribution of tobacco products to Guangdong due to the mistaken identification of the goods as Japanese. We are very grateful for your association's telegram certifying that the goods are entirely domestic. Subsequently, we received your letter requesting that our association instruct Huacheng and Huada to entrust their printing permanently to your association. We have already conveyed this to the two companies. Since the economic severance with Japan, our colleagues in the industry have never lagged behind in their patriotic spirit. On September 29th, we gathered representatives from various industry associations to conduct a thorough discussion and seek a complete solution. Later, I personally attended your association's meeting and proposed that all printing used by our member tobacco factories be entrusted to your association, but this was not adopted. After certifying the Guangdong-bound tobacco products of Huacheng and Huada, you claimed to bear considerable responsibility and requested permanent printing, refusing to accept all printing and addressing the issue piecemeal, which is difficult to understand. I have scheduled a meeting for 6:30 PM on December 2nd, inviting your association members, including Mr. Lu Fengzhu, Wang Jinshi, Huang Zhongming, and Hu Peiran, to discuss a fundamental solution in order to achieve universality and openness. Please be informed accordingly.</p>

<p>The National Physicians' Association submitted a petition to the Central Training Department and the Department of Health, requesting the retention of the original name of the Physicians' Association in order to ensure consistency in governance and naming. The association stated that it had recently received letters from the Physicians' Associations of Wuxian and Kunming City, stating that they had received instructions from the Party Affairs Consolidation Committee of the county and the Party Affairs Guidance Committee of the city, respectively, stating that, according to instructions from the Central Training Department, they were to rename the Wuxian Physicians' Association as the Wuxian Western Medicine Association and the Kunming City Physicians' Association as the Kunming City Western Medicine Physicians' Association, etc. Upon receiving these letters, the association asked whether the nomenclature across the country was to be unified and whether the renaming of the association was appropriate. The association deliberated in detail at its tenth executive committee meeting, believing that academics should not be limited by national borders, and medicine should treat all equally. Under the current party governance, consolidation, and construction, everything is being renewed. The so-called "new" largely adopts the practices of advanced countries, aiming for progress, without being slave to Chinese/foreign, North/South, East/West distinctions. Looking back at our four thousand years of craftsmanship, arts, culture, clothing, and customs, we have almost always possessed the ability to be pioneers and visionaries. However, times have changed, and today we find ourselves constantly lagging behind. Consequently, in the past century, the influence of Western culture has swept eastward, unstoppable. Today, what the country values is Western methods, what it learns is Western methods, what it implements is Western methods, and what it uses is Western things. The government leads from above, and the people follow from below. Patriotic individuals cannot help but feel ashamed that China's sages do not arise, and we are increasingly becoming barbarians. However, under these circumstances, in order to defend ourselves and survive, we have no choice but to abandon our weaknesses and adopt others' strengths. Therefore, the Westernization of techniques in the country today is not limited to medicine alone. There is no reason for medicine to be uniquely different simply because it is Western. Moreover, although the term "physician" is not an ancient one, it has been in use for almost thirty years. The informed almost universally recognize it as the name for scientific medicine. Society is accustomed to it, uses it in writing, and the medical community accepts it. It is expected that scientific medicine will advance and flourish with the progress of the nation, spreading throughout the land of Yu and Shenzhou (China), becoming as common as the transformation of caterpillars, and standing alongside lawyers, pharmacists, accountants, engineers, architects, and other professionals, working together in the international community, unifying their names, unifying their realities, and not differentiating themselves simply because their knowledge comes from the West. There is also no reason for medicine to be uniquely different simply because it is Western. Furthermore, according to the instructions of the Party Departments of Wuxian and Kunming City, they are either to be renamed as Western Medicine Associations or Western Medicine Physicians' Associations. Regarding the term "physician," it seems to be discarded and rejected like worn-out shoes. Investigation reveals that the establishment of Physicians' Associations is not limited to these few locations across the country, and the local Party Departments have not issued the same instructions to all of them. State policies inevitably suffer from a lack of unification, which is deeply disheartening. The association believes that at a time when national affairs, governance, and social problems are complex and numerous, it is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to major reforms, consider the overall situation, and not confine themselves to one corner, forgetting the environment, not being easily swayed by superficial changes, overcomplicating matters, not neglecting the major while focusing on the minor, and not going astray. Only then can politics be easily guided onto the right track, and academics will increasingly trend towards unity. The association humbly ventures to present its views, hoping that your department will understand the situation, learn from external environments, and be willing to maintain the original name of the Physicians' Association, placing them alongside lawyers, pharmacists, accountants, engineers, and architects in order to ensure consistency in governance and naming, which is truly convenient and fair. Respectfully submitted to the Central Training Department of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Ministry of Interior's Department of Health, Xu Nao-li, Chairman of the National Physicians' Association.</p>

<p>Reader's Letter</p>
<p>Announcement: Since October 22nd, this column has presented four questions for soliciting opinions, namely (1) Regarding the League of Nations, (2) Regarding boycotting Japanese goods, (3) Regarding volunteer armies, and (4) Regarding uniting hearts and minds to face the outside world. In the past month, we have received many responses. Those that have been published in this column include the opinions of Mr. Lin Yifang, Mr. Liu Boyong, Mr. Zhong Xia, and Mr. Zheng Hongsheng on boycotting Japanese goods, Mr. Qingyuan on volunteer armies, and Mr. Ding Jichan on uniting to face the outside world, all of which are of great value. In addition, there are quite a few others that could not be published due to space limitations. Now, the situation has changed drastically, the national crisis is becoming more urgent, the League of Nations negotiations have completely failed, the bitter battle in Heilongjiang Province has finally led to its fall, and the disturbances in Tianjin continue unabated. In the midst of this perilous state of the Chinese nation, mere sorrow, anxiety, and impatience are useless. Every one of our citizens should stand up, muster deep courage, and use their passionate minds to come up with a relatively appropriate plan for the major issues at hand and contribute to the authorities and the people. Now, please submit two questions as follows: (1) Japan's trampling of Heilongjiang Province and invasion of the Middle East route not only disregards our national sovereignty but also provokes Soviet Russia. According to common sense, Soviet Russia can no longer tolerate it. If it joins the war, it will replay the Russo-Japanese War of twenty-seven years ago. At that time, what attitude should our country take towards Japan and Soviet Russia? If it involves European and American countries, what should we do with each country? (2) National Government Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has decided to set off north to recover the lost territories soon. This is of course what the people of the whole country eagerly hope for. From now on, the overall situation will change dramatically. Military preparations will of course be the responsibility of the government. On the part of the people, what responsibilities should be fulfilled and what work should be done? What should be done to boycott Japanese goods and train volunteer armies? Each answer should be limited to a maximum of one thousand words, avoiding empty talk and focusing on proposing methods. This newspaper will select the best ones for disclosure and public discussion, depending on the capacity of this column. If you agree with the methods proposed by others, please also state so. Please include your full name, gender, age, occupation, or place of study, and native place, attach communication stamps, and a corresponding amount of postage stamps. Those that cannot be published in the newspaper will be informed by letter. As for the three questions of education, occupation, and marriage, they will still be handled according to the existing regulations. Respectfully announced.</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Tingguang's Message (Agrees with Mr. Lu's proposal to punish corruption): Corrupt officials harm the country and the people, which has been the same throughout history. It is painful to talk about. Recently, there has been a great promotion of transforming the government into a clean and honest one. It is not difficult to say, but it is difficult to do. Now that the national crisis is approaching, the whole country is indignant, but I have not heard of anyone who is determined to save the country. Once the enemy troops arrive, life will not be guaranteed, what about property? On the one hand, we criticize corruption, and on the other hand, we must advocate that the wealthy donate. As for punishing corruption, we must first rely on the judiciary, eliminate long-standing practices, and be impartial. Knowing that someone is corrupt, do we dare to come out and testify? This is also an important question. There is a saying, "The madman is afraid of the cat, and the mice propose to bell the cat's ear. When they hear the alarm, they run away." The mice applauded in agreement, but when they proposed who would dare to bell the cat, everyone was dumbfounded. The so-called punishing corruption is the same. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Lu were able to see this, and I also fully agree, but no one dares to come out and testify. The Kuomintang has supervisory committees and supervisory courts. Why not exercise their powers in practice? Cat, cat, mouse, mouse!</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Sir, In the news item reported on November 29th regarding the Committee for the Protection of People's Residence, the word "Protection" was placed below the words "People's Residence," i.e., "People's Residence Protection Committee." This was a mistake by the news agency's hand, and we are afraid that it will confuse the facts. Accordingly, we have prepared a letter requesting your newspaper to kindly publish a correction in the Letter to the Editor column. We commend the editor of Shen Bao, Mr. Pu An. Sincerely, The Preparatory Committee of the United Association of Citizens of the Special District of Shanghai, November 30th.</p>

<p>The Great China Rubber Factory declares that this factory was established by Xue Fuji, Wu Zhesheng, Yu Xingben, and others who have studied industrial arts in Japan for many years. Since the launch of their products in 1928, they have manufactured no fewer than 20 types of Shuang Qian brand rubber galoshes for men and women, running shoes, sports shoes, and rain shoes. They are all inexpensive and of good quality, surpassing imported goods, and are deeply appreciated and adopted by patriotic compatriots. They are a rare factory in the Chinese rubber industry. They have received dozens of awards and certifications from the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the current Ministry of Industry, and various competitions at home and abroad. They have also been promoted and certified by national goods organizations, so their business is very developed. Recently, since there is no domestic manufacturing of raw materials for the rubber industry, they are planning to establish the Great China Calcium Factory on Xieqiao Road in western Shanghai to manufacture calcium carbonate, which is a basic industrial raw material. The daily output of calcium carbonate is four tons, which is only enough for their own use this year. It is expected that there will be a large output in January next year, which will be used to supply the domestic goods industry, and so on.</p>

<p>European War Diary · Translated by Gu Ang Ruo</p>
<p>November 11th: I issued orders to all army commanders to instruct them to occupy the retreating areas of the enemy troops. November 17th: The Allied forces crossed the enemy's defense lines at the time of the armistice. 30th: The Allied forces recovered all the estimated areas (France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Alsace-Lorraine). I entered Metz on the 25th and arrived in Strasbourg on the 26th.</p>
<p>At this time, I was preparing to occupy the Rhineland. I divided the Rhine into four zones: Mainz, Koblenz, Cologne, and Ellenz. I appointed the commanders of the French, American, British, and Belgian armies to occupy them separately. In principle, each zone was occupied by the troops of one country. As for the bridgeheads and the left bank of the Rhine from the Cologne bridgehead to the Dutch border, they were occupied by garrisons jointly compiled by the Allied forces of several countries to maintain the nature of the Allied occupation.</p>
<p>The total number of Allied troops occupying the Rhine, including the front line and reserves, was 40 infantry divisions and 5 cavalry divisions, and the military expenses were borne by the German government.</p>
<p>In fact, the troops estimating the bridgeheads could not completely preserve the joint nature. French troops originally co-garrisoned the Cologne bridgehead. Later, when French troops were temporarily transferred to the Belgian area near Ellenz, it was completely garrisoned by British troops.</p>
<p>December 1st: Allied forces entered German territory. 9th: Arrived at the Rhine. 13th: Crossed the river. 17th: The bridgehead was completely occupied. From then on, the Allied forces garrisoned the Rhine. The defeated German army could no longer move and was subject to the disposal of the Allied governments and peace treaties.</p>
<p>Although the world is eager for the early completion of the peace treaty, the delay in negotiations is inevitable. President Wilson was slow to arrive in France, the scope of the issues to be resolved was vast, and coordination within the Alliance was necessary in advance. All of these factors made the peace treaty have to be extended. The treaty was drafted after four months of work and accepted by Germany after another five months.</p>
<p>The armistice treaty signed in Le Forest was valid for only 36 days, and it expired on December 17th. At that time, the Allied plenipotentiaries began to arrive in Paris one after another. Therefore, the armistice treaty of November 11th had to be renewed. On December 12th and 13th, 1918, negotiations were held again. The former representatives met again in the original car in Le Forest and formed the following agreement:</p>
<p>(1) The validity period of the armistice treaty is extended by one month, until January 17th, 1919.</p>
<p>(2) The Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces reserves the right to occupy the neutral area on the right bank of the Rhine from the Cologne bridgehead to the Dutch border. (To be continued)</p>
