<p>蘇俄自勵行五年實業計劃後。歐美各國大都料其必無成功。故雖畏之而不甚措意。近史丹林在蘇俄實業理事會宣稱五年實業計劃。已逐步進行。可望成功。本年增加出産百分之四十五分之程序目下正在踐行。蘇俄經濟前途。大可樂觀。其言固近於自誇。然觀今日柏林電訊所載。法國著名財政家巴耳孟爾視察蘇俄回國後所發表之意見。亦謂蘇俄實業計劃。無論如何。定可完成百分之七十五或八十。屆時世界經濟界將起大恐怖。其所處地位。足以破壞各國實業。如英德等國專恃出口貿易者影響尤鉅。故德報對於此文。已大爲注意。德意志報且謂各國今尚以機器與材料售俄。或假以技術專家。使其完成實業計劃。恐將自貽伊戚。已可見其大有戒心矣。史丹林曾言。近來世界經濟之過程。不僅爲蘇聯之一種轉換點。亦爲資本主義國家之一種轉換點。在蘇聯則經濟日有發展。在資本主義國則經濟日趨衰落蓋其所以自信甚深。而進行益急。吾知今後各工業國。對於蘇聯之實業計劃。必不再如以前之漠視。惟觀昨日内瓦電謂國聯經濟委員會。今日否决法代表所提希圖協力抵制蘇俄傾銷商品之動議。則又可知各國對於蘇俄之意見。今猶未能一致也。</p>

<p>▲七對三敵人轉下風</p>
<p>眞茹隊久别重來、豪氣奪人、臘克斯以逸待勞、精神十足、一塲大戰、固在意中、眞茹一舉手之勞、連中三元、觀衆揚眉吐氣、手舞足蹈、樂極生悲、盛極轉衰、五分鐘之内、二次失關、戰士加緊工作、觀衆呼喊助威、轉眼之際、繼續二次告捷、將近完局、臘克斯又奪回一球、上半時、眞茹以五對三占先、下半時眞茹挾勝餘之威、不久迭破敵關、先後二下、大戰閉幕、眞茹以七對三得勝、</p>
<p>▲新陣綫實力堪驚人</p>
<p>眞茹征菲後之變化、厥爲陣綫之更動、往昔陳鎭和居中樞要職、接應八方、今則名列前茅、冲鋒陷陣、陳家球調歸内部、改攻爲守、各得其所、攻守咸宜、此舉於全軍實力、大有進益、惟謝全和之守門、堅硬有餘、惟智巧與經騐、尚不及梁官濂也、楊保森新進好手、前途堪慶、其餘戰將之身手、觀者早有定論、固無須費詞也、</p>

<h3>戰雲起敵人先下手</h3>
<p>三時已屆、戰雲彌滿、敵人先下毒手、球自左人、横過門前、右翼還中、左内射門、球出力弱、守門謝全和接之抛出、球又臨門、守門臥地撲出、頗具工夫、轉　而成角球、射來甚佳、乃頂而不中、幾度風浪、逐一廻避、至時雲破月出、否極泰來、觀我戰士、整其行裝、待時而動矣、</p>
<p>▲五虎將三次下敵壘</p>
<p>臘克斯攻旣不利、守又失當、龍門區域内、時見眞茹五虎將、憑其身手、左右衝突、符左翼傳中合度、戴中鉻乘勢斜撥、羅海光當茲佳境一射成功楊保　主踢任意球、羅海光轉脚向右方、陳鎭和奮不顧身、　　起處球破網入、梅右翼路海東征、陳鎭和問　出關、一球臨門、羅海光天賜奇福、坐收巨功、三球之獲、先後十五分鐘、平均五分鐘一球也、</p>
<p>▲爭先後雙方齊努力</p>
<p>敵人於失勢之下、努力反攻、左翼一脚挑中、右内柯萊脫乘勢射擊、切門而入轉眼之際、右翼麥特深進腹地、轉脚交左、左翼愛爾傑迎起一脚、守門得而仍失、臘克斯一鼓作氣、連得二球、頗令觀衆爲之不安也、然而眞茹健兒、滿身是膽、小有打擊、氣不爲挫、初乘敵人外出内部空虛、戴中鋒一馬　先徑自攻關守門急不及待、趨前爭奪略施巧計守門中伏倒地、前衞麥特急回代守、戴中鋒猛烈射擊、麥特心慌意亂、漏入　内、繼後梅右翼踢角球、戴中鋒一頂成功、遂成五對二之比爲時將終、臘克斯柯萊脫在混戰中、打入一球、上半時五對三、眞茹占先、</p>
<p>再戰聲中、眞茹氣壯神旺前鋒壓迫、有加無已、楊保森傳球向左羅海光受人窺視、有意廻避、符和　脚步加緊假勞一脚斜入網内、從此眞茹高射低擊、往復不已、戴中鋒接得梅右翼之球、輕描淡寫、順勢送入成當日七對三之終局、以後三十五分鐘、眞茹聲勢雖盛、入門艱難、蓋敵人努力防守以免再有喪地辱師之恥也、</p>

<h3>吳門趣掌故　飯牛翁</h3>
<p>▲大雪奇寒今年庚午十一月二十日奇寒。本報記云。三十餘年所未有。回溯前淸光緒十九年壬辰十一月初旬起大雪五晝夜。堆積平地一尺强。板屋茅蘆。城内外盡皆壓倒。冷度在攝氏表零點下。太湖連底凝凍。胥門萬年橋湖達横塘越來谿。車馬於就上行走。湖中船隻凍碎者不計其數。人家檐漏冰柱。自屋角到地如竹竿。小兒章敲下作竹馬騎。貧民乞丐大都凍死。棺木賣空。以大磁缸盛殮。最奇者薙髮店代人剃鬚髭。一刀纔落。面皮與鬚髭俱下。致有對簿公庭者。滿城引爲笑談。至今六十歲人。皆能說及。予是時十九歲也。一刹那間。不謂垂垂老矣。轉瞬甲戍花甲。奇寒凡兩度逢。壬辰之寒約半月。庚午之寒祗一日耳。</p>
<p>▲湯文正燬五聖廟　南方之有五通神。猶北省之有狐狸精。其踪跡飄忽不定。一旦神來降臨。無法驅遣。蘇州齊門外支硎山。俗稱上方山。塔院供奉五聖。相傳五聖爲五兄弟。山下居民呼之爲大老爺。二老爺。三老爺。四老爺。五老爺。尤以三老爺最厲害。賞罰分明。傍山左右横塘蠡市新郭里一帶。凡鄉村靑年婦女。往往被五聖暗中姦汚。一經姦汚後。其家必得賞。貧者立致小康。若被姦汚而心不甘服。延僧道設醮拜佛求鎭壓。必遭大罰。非火焚則疾病。所以是敢怒不敢言。一聽蹂躪。每歲八月十七八夜。行春橋簫鼓畫船。千燈萬燭。傾城空巷而登山獻祭。習以爲常。官廳不禁。雖禁亦無可如何也。康熙初元。睢州湯介庵先生（斌）巡撫江南</p>
<h3>鬱洲　·七·五·翁</h3>
<p>偶讀方輿紀要鬱洲山在海州東北十九里海中、有大洲周圍數百里。謂之鬱洲、亦曰郁州。山海經所謂郁山在海中者也。晋隆安五年。孫恩襲建康。不克浮海北走郁州云云。二十世紀各國。以覓地殖民爲唯一之政策、郁州逼近海疆。遇有戰事。深慮爲敵據作避風取水殖民之地。此則臥榻之旁。較香港等地尤關緊要。目下該處不知若何情形、老眼昏花。輿圖字小。小時未能查得、亦不知海軍界已未注意及之。</p>
<h3>一得之言　·秋·水</h3>
<p>▲假使一個年老的男子。娶了一個年少的女子。人們就會加以羨慕或加以妒忌。假使一個年老的女子。嫁了一個年少的男子。那末人們都會加以譏笑。男女間之不平等有如此。</p>
<p>▲上帝把虛榮心放在人類中男性的頭腦中。以便人類中的女性者加以征服。加以軟化。加以文明的洗禮。</p>
<p>▲一個男子的愛情。其無價値與隔年的日曆一樣。除非你能把他的愛情全部收爲己有時。</p>
<p>▲愛情像你頭上的頂髮和你嘴裏的牙齒一樣。得之則爲無價之資。失之則不値半文。</p>
<p>▲現代的婚姻和現代的小說一樣。天天在加以縮短。當你立在結婚臺下。聽牧師們喃喃致詞之時。你就可以翻到最後的一頁。看到最後的結果。</p>
<p>▲差不多每個女人。可以下嫁一個男子。假使後者能設法把他從前的女人忘懷。男子在此種情形之下而自覺慚愧者。這是他的弱點。</p>
<p>▲能幹的男子。在家裏發佈命令。像温和的忠告一樣。聰明的女子。對男子們發佈命令　像一個甜蜜的要求一樣。</p>
<p>▲戀愛是一條紅蘿荀。它引誘着愚蠢如驢的男子。放棄了自由的原野。而入到於籠阱之中。</p>
<p>。聞蘇臺有此邪神淫祀。下車伊始。卽統率士兵。告示軍民諸色人等。同赴上方山頂。將廟宇燒燬。五聖神泥像。投入太湖。從此閭閻婦女。能保貞節。九縣百姓。額手稱頌。謂西門豹治巫無此德澤也。遂捐金募石。建坊牌於胥關接官亭側。題四字曰民不能忘。舟車冠蓋往來。莫不仰瞻俯思。迄今三百年。猶傳說不衰。</p>
<h3>廣濟輪破匪之零碎　心危</h3>
<p>招商局廣濟輪遇盜破獲情形。已見報載。但該輪抵申時旅客李君爲予述種種可紀之小消息至夥。亟爲轉述。以供衆覽。</p>
<p>▲漂亮盜首　盜首葉明生。年祇二十六顪。面目俊秀。儼如貴家子。身穿深色嗶嘰駱駝絨袍子。上船時定九號官艙。船員等見其手携大皮包。獨包一艙室。疑爲黨中要人。故十分優待之。不料開船之後。該匪首卽到統艙内。默察乘客貧富。見行李較多之客。則逗留不去。更與身穿靑布衣腰束作裙頭帶毡帽者十餘人作手式與目語。由是引起船員之大疑。至黄花關報請超武艦水警搜查。而乃破案也。</p>
<p>▲油浸蔴繩　該匪首被捕押到超武艦内時。堅不吐露口供。經艦長取桐油浸之蔴繩一根猛抽之。先詰其新寗台輪是否彼刦。至是該匪忍痛不下。祇得實言供招。</p>
<p>▲行刦計劃　該匪供述行刦情由。謂本人爲海門人。台匪中公推其爲出外辦差領袖（卽行刦頭目）新寗台輪亦爲台匪所刦、但非彼所指揮今次謀刦廣濟。匪衆考慮多次。派定一百四十人爲此案之辦差者。以二十人上船。另派一百二十人駕匪船六艘。在黄花關外一百里地海面守候。準備搬贓之用。本人在温州設有機關。此次上船。圖刦三十萬元。如果船中現欵不足此數。則將廣濟輪刦去。命招商局取三十萬元來贖。因廣濟吃水淺。船身小。可以刦入各海峽也。</p>
<p>▲各船造化　匪首葉明生又稱該帮圖刦商輪　以廣濟輪爲開始。繼而起者。對滬台綫内之新寳善達興益利舟山及穿山等六船。决計逐輪搜刦。預備二個月内刦取七輪。今本人被捕。則刦輪之計劃已破裂。造化了各輪局。尤是是招商局。又稱同黨匪徒有六七百名。分處沿海各島嶼。在上海温州均有機關。</p>
<p>▲易盜押温　温州東門有匪盜機關。又押匪領捉。無如葉受刑已重。兩足折斷。</p>
<p>不能行動。遂改易第三匪首到甌。在東門破獲機關一處。留温之四匪已逃。僅起出木壳槍一支。現各匪還押超武艦。由艦長盤查其盜窟所在地。以便派大隊軍警往剿。並營救新寗台輪被綁之客云。</p>
<h3>西人研究中國文學瑣談　笑滬</h3>
<p>疇昔之夜。偶與前輩談及西人研究我國文學之事。頗饒趣味。但吾國人。似覺可恥也。</p>
<p>淸季。有美國人名丁惠貞者。極喜研究中國文學。凡經史子集。無所不熟。光緒時。曾點爲我國翰林。亦云奇矣。丁曾有一聯。徵我國人民對之。聯爲一三鳥害人。鴉鴿雀。」意爲我國之鴉片與社會上放白鴿之黑幕。以及雀牌三物。）内容含有吃。嫖。賭三事。害人非淺也。我國人見其上聯已出。遂各自搜索枯腸。搆思下聯。未幾有一人對出。遂修書與丁。其下聯爲「四物除爾。鱗鳳龍。」丁讀之。大憤。因我國曾有一古語曰「鱗鳳龍龜。」此蓋諷丁爲龜也。丁乃更出一聯。惡咒我國人曰。「雀兒頂。馬蹄袖。衣冠禽獸。」其意駡淸人之服裝也。然至今無人對出。（按此丁惠貞乃八國聯軍時擬條約之稿者。）</p>
<p>當公共租界會審公堂未收回時。堂内會審官西人某。熟讀四書。五卅慘案時。有數大學生往見西人。西人以孔子之道訊之。大學生皆瞠目不能對。良久始曰。腐儒信仰之書。不適用於現今之時代。此西人哂曰。母謂不適用。此種學說。萬古不朽。希爾等熟讀之。諸大學生皆赧然而退。</p>
<h3>浙疫慘聞　石顔也</h3>
<p>獻歲以來。浙疫猖獗。不幸者之死於腦膜炎者以千百計。誠浙人二十年來之大禍也。有浙友來滬。述疫中兩事甚慘。走筆錄之。以付本談。</p>
<p>▲新郎疫死婦爲尼。諸曁之鄉。有吾友之戚田姓。元旦後十日。爲子娶於宋姓女。賓朋雲集。喜溢庭字。新夫婦固以與惡環境奮鬥而結合者。故益覺此日之讀躇滿志。詎歡樂肇始。慘别隨之。吉日方逝。新郎驟嬰時疫。鄉僻之區。醫藥難期不時之需。所延地方醫生。均以對此症爲門外漢。不能對症而投藥。可憐未及終日。新郎竟抛其愛人而去矣。新郎堂上兩老。揮涙爲愛子慟。自不待言。新婦更痛不欲生。當其夫桐棺三尺。慘置中堂。屢欲躍入。爲同命鴛鴦。格於護之者衆。不獲如願。事後服毒。又爲人覺。五日後。乘間赴杭。入某菴祝髮。迨其雙方家人覓至。環泣勸歸。不可。謂歸則誓死。留此則尚有見期。允我偷生者。請母違我志。衆見其志不可奪。從之。自此六橋三竺間。乃添一薄命紅顔。度其暮鼓晨鐘之生涯矣。吁。</p>
<p>▲愛子慘逝父繼之　杭州附近某鎭。有黄翁六十獲兒。家財且達數十萬。巨財而有子承繼。翁志滿矣。乃者昊天不弔。降凶於此五齡童之翁子。活潑天眞之稚子。染病迄死。未達三小時。縫有巨金。難贖兒命。翁失此寳。覺前途絶望。衰老之軀。幾番慟悼。便爾臥床。碎心之疾。藥石不能救。愛子慘逝八日。老父卽繼之而去。亦云慘矣。</p>
<p>更正　昨日「菸草談屑之標題。誤排「菸草詼屑」。特此更正。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（三七二）　包天笑</h3>
<p>第十七回　駐顔有術翠黛溷蛾眉　續命無方黄金市駿骨</p>
<p>從此以後。花元春便把那一隻白金手表。向抽屜角落裏一塞。本來還有一隻匣子。現在那隻匣子。也實做了「買球還櫝」四字。不知抛向那裏去了。有一天。也是尋别的東西。去翻抽屜。别的東西没有尋着。又看見了那白金手表。瞧見那周圍盤的小金剛鑽裏面。砌了許多的灰塵。那白色也黯然無光。花元春不免想起了送伊手表的那位南洋少年。他是何等的慷慨揮霍。不知那一天再到上海來。連忙用細牙刷。把金剛鑽裏的灰塵。細刷了一回。白金的表面上。也擦了一擦。另外尋出一隻匣子來。安放了進去。擺在首飾箱子裏。總算那隻白金手表。一向蒙塵在外。此刻又奉迎回宫了。現在花老六又想起那一隻白金手表。以爲這是値五百塊錢的東西。就算打他一個二折。也可以當到一百塊錢。再把别的東西湊湊。也差不多了。於是鄭重其事的從首飾箱裏取出來。因爲相帮粗手粗脚。便交託房間裏的阿金妲去。又關照伊這是白金的。比了黄金的還要貴好幾倍。不要被典當裏。當做是銀的。這是從前一個有相好的客人送的。他在我身上。錢用了五六千。只將隻這們一隻手表。做了紀念品。我一有了錢。就要把他贖出來的。阿金姐便欣欣然拿了那隻手表。到典當裏去。從三櫃朝奉手裏。移到二櫃朝奉。又由二櫃朝奉手裏。移到頭櫃朝奉。頭櫃朝奉卸下了他的銅邊老花眼鏡。看了又看。再把一個小顯微錢。閉了一隻眼睛看了半天。又把那手表開了。在耳朶邊聽了半天。方纔說道。至多當三十塊錢。阿金道。這是白金的　。比了黄金還要貴好幾倍。你們不要做阿曲死。看看子細。怎麽說是只能當三十塊錢。那一圈小金剛鑽。也不止値了三十塊錢咧。那二櫃朝奉。正也看不煞那手表是銅的。是鋼的。或是銀的。現在聽得阿金說是白金的。倒從新把那隻手表。子細視瞧。因爲他白金的東西。實在没有賞鑒過。他想白金也没有什麽希奇。和銀的也差不多。那個頭櫃朝奉。是有了一把年記了。聽得阿金駡他阿曲死。早已老羞成怒。鬍子氣得都蹺了起來。便冷笑一聲道。我們只知道金子是黄的。没有知道金子是白的。什麽白金。我們說不知道。那是洋鬼子把來騙騙中國小孩子的。</p>

<h3>外匯反覆無常</h3>
<p>▲掛牌改縮···内盤大鬆</p>
<p>昨日英美銀市俱已回低、而匯　亦降、惟歐市趨勢恍惚、或復復升、殆美國維持甚力、至於滬市匯豐掛牌已縮半檔、計英金一二五、現爲一先令一辨士七五、美金二五、計廿七元七五、印匯七五、計七十七羅比二五、法郎六元計七百十元、德匯一元、計一百十七馬克、和洋七五、計六十盾一五、香港仍爲七十八兩半、新加坡加二兩、計二百零二兩、日金加一分七五、計一兩七錢七分七五、惟銀行内盤　堅嗣疲、誠明暗逈異、猶與上日適反、市况之反覆、殊不　解、實乃金市風　汹湧、半日間竟達　　兩之迥顧、終則狂跌廿四兩有零、以致匯　理帶而頽、良以空氣險惡之刺激、迨午時收市比較隔昨、計英金晨三一二五、美金長六二五、日　跌去三分半、人心惶駭、　商如福昌、乾昌祥·福順等均有賣出英金以套條子、計成交十餘萬鎊、銀行若一井·匯豐·正金·麥行·朝鮮等均有吸進、又中日等行稍有互做、而美金金業中少數脫售、惟日全因套頭不治、故無成交、午後因逄週六停市、</p>

<h3>洋釐輔幣略有變化</h3>
<p>▲市塲概况　昨日錢業市塲、仍祇早晨一市交易、下午休業、故市氣情形清寂逾恒、厘市略形上挺、輔幣中角洋漲落互見乃爲平衡兩穩角洋市而關係銅元則縮風又熾、大致前日長勢太甚而受反響所致云</p>
<p>▲厘昂折借形勢尚穩　（洋厘）因買賣均稀、市氣淸寂、然銀行界欲購大批頭襯、無人供應、是以厘價加昂七毫半爲七錢二分三厘（銀拆）仍爲白借、劃頭無加水銀根以用　尚稀、拆票寥寥故祇點綴市面、毫無正式機會、逆料最近半月中、恐無銀拆市價之可言也、</p>
<p>▲江漲廣跌銅元忽縮　江南小洋、以日前市面紊亂故不能堅守、結果轉較廣角小法數厘甚或一分有奇者現在市面漸人正軌、故步步上漲、平衡市面、昨晨爲六錢九分五厘、較前日加漲一分六厘做出交易早市一千五百角、廣東小洋、回跌二厘半、爲六錢六分一厘、做出交易十六萬角、銅元忽縮八千文、爲三百七十一千文　　銀洋進出依然寂寥　（銀欵）昨日銀行收解、大體寥落、蓋下午休業無從詳查、僅聞總額華商收解二百餘萬外商一百餘萬、日商收解亦祇百餘萬、錢莊銀公單收解一千二百餘萬劃頭欵收解一百六十餘萬（洋欵）匯劃票欵早市做出六十一萬、午市無市、鈔票亦祇早市一萬、塲外鈔票十二萬五千、銀行買賣二十餘萬、各銀行洋戸往來僅十餘萬、支單六七萬、錢莊洋公單收解一百七八十萬、洋劃頭欵收解七八十萬、小錢莊交易三十餘萬</p>
<h3>證劵　債價益形堅俏</h3>
<p>昨日本埠證劵市塲各公債市况、現貨交易仍稀少僅開出六千五百元、期市以　價堅俏、交易忽轉熱閙、市塲賣買興旺異常、計兩盤間成交達七百十餘萬元市上乘高價售出者頗不少、而需要者亦甚殷、債價乃益形挺俏、惟求供形勢、尚鮮重大出入、兩盤間僅數角之盤旋、以較前日、僅漲二角左右云、</p>

<h3>棉市略平</h3>
<p>▲近期續漲四錢</p>
<p>棉市略平、趨勢較爲和緩、因金價回跌、美棉轉疲、致人心稍軟、聞上日東棉洋行多頭了結六·七萬擔、一般空頭殺去　結不少、故市情暫平、前途仍依匯兌及印棉爲轉移耳、期棉前日（二十日）至八時半收盤各、均爲四十五兩、日商大批了結六·七萬擔、所中當局維持購買現貨、賣出亦有三四萬擔之巨、昨日午後四時半開盤、市氣稍疲、各跌二三錢、二三盤散戸扒空又漲、二百擔、前日成交計十二萬六千六百擔、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>美棉漸形轉機</h3>
<p>▲棉布市况頗佳</p>
<p>二十日紐約電告一週棉市狀况云、印度消息旣令人興奮、蘭開夏布廠亦决計復工、加以國内棉布需求增加、綜此數因同業乃購進、缺方亦補入、而代理商行又有若干需求再經紀人亦買進、此殆爲日人代購也、利物浦與歐陸需求尚殷、據利物浦消息孟買幾無日不在利物浦購進原棉十月期漲至一角二分時　需求卽漸減　、反動人氣乘之而起、其理由半爲實際上地位之較易鬆動、半爲價高則値棉田必多惶慮也、惟價落時之買出、輙爲同業購進所吸收南方甘霖使數處之棉出工作爲之延緩、但新棉作聞進行良好、據數方面消息、自一九二五年以還、歷年此時之耕種工作、未有如今年此時進行之多者、</p>
<p>又訊、棉市人氣穩定跌洲收買最多、一般形象似爲缺方之補進與同業之結價　現貨需求尚佳、基礎價格稍覺堅固、紡織品成交較多、近期數月稍軟因棉田减少不似預料之多也、多方觀念爲之和緩、</p>
<p>又訊、去年底多頭了結、市價稍低、致使棉布市面處於甚不美滿之地位、但在一月間漸呈起色、價亦較堅、而銷路亦較廣、尤以經過整理工程者爲甚、今年最初六星期之銷數、聞超過出産百分之二十二月初布價鬆動　而棉價則上騰、廠家頗爲煩慮、以銷數近稍减少也、但閱時不久、購者漸多、爭定貨物、布價現乃較堅、目前雖銷路佳而存底少、然現有之價格無利可沾布價有向上之趨勢、但恐銷數見增、有若干廠或將於三月間抛棄其續减出産之計劃耳、廠家百分之七十元於三月一日起廢止女工與童工之夜間工作、如棉業再有百分之五贊成此舉則屆時婦童夜工卽可廢除、想此事當可實現也、附週末統計如左、（單位千包）</p>

<h3>棉紗統稅實施後中日紗商之利害比較</h3>
<p>▲華商却被多徵</p>
<p>國聞社云、棉紗稅則以前海關原分四級征收、此次改征統稅、財政部本擬分爲三級、嗣徇日商方面之主張、定爲兩級之稅率、卽二十三支以下每担征二元七角半、二十三支以上、每担征三元七角半、按之實際、華商紗支以二十三支以下者爲多、日商紗支以二十三支以上者爲多、譬如日商四十支、紗價値三百兩、征稅三元七角五分、華商十四支紗、價値一百五十兩、征稅二元七角五分、是以價値相差半數之紗支、平均計之、華商僅應完納一元八角七分半之統稅、却被多征八角七分半矣、華商紗廠合以此項稅率、顯不平均、已分呈當軸、請求改訂平允之稅率矣、茲並譯錄上海每日新聞所載之日方論調以明之、（以下節譯上海每日新聞）棉紗統稅實施、華洋紗廠無差别、一律規定二十三支以下、每百斤征二元七角半、二十三支以上征三元七角半、此統稅實施後、則中日對立之紗廠、究有若何之利益及障害、値得一般之注目、統稅之實施結果、日商紗廠最得有利條件、最初所傳征稅不用　單位制、且對進口棉紗、亦課同類之稅、因此外來棉紗之威嚇、可以完全一掃、又最近銀價暴落、一時無恢復之望、故海關金單位之課稅、事業上與增加關稅無異、對於進口貨徵金單位之新關稅、對於國内品課銀單位之統稅、實爲對抗外來品之最有效果的條件、雖在華中日紗廠、同具此有利條件、然日商對華商之優越地位、卽在稅率之畫分、所謂二十三支爲界限是也、最初財部之提案、本擬别爲三種、日商主張兩種、結果定爲二種稅率、中日紗廠之出品、本有粗細之界、日商分二十支爲中心及四十二支爲中心、華商分二十支及十六支爲中心、今定二十三支以下、一律每百斤課二元七角半、故接近於二十三支之紗、最屬有利、極爲明瞭、華商以十支及十六支爲中心、較日商以二十支爲中心者、當立於不利條件之地位、至二十三支以上、一律課三元七角半、則日商四十二支爲中心者、决無不利之點、况今後出品之高級化、對於進口貨之對抗上尤爲得策、去年烟草出廠稅之實施、遂使華商香烟公司陷於窮地、而爲英美烟公司所獨占、故今日棉紗統稅之實施、日商紗廠並無所失、反可將以前之難題逐步展開矣、</p>

<h3>黄楚九事業之一福昌控案開審</h3>
<p>▲公司財産另已抵押</p>
<p>▲原告請判决後再商</p>
<p>▲辯論終結定期宣判</p>
<p>黄楚九生前經營商業種類繁多、及其死後、而日夜銀行及大世界游覽儲蓄兩種、首先停止營業、各存戸爲保全債權計、紛纷各有主張、現除該兩項營業外、福昌烟公司亦已被債權人禀奉特區地方法院先行假扣押、</p>
<p>福昌被封閉　緣福昌公司製造原料、向由美華·友誼·美豐·聯美·等四家烟葉公司供給、拖欠美華貨欵銀九萬八千八百餘兩、欠友誼二萬九千七百餘兩、欠美豐二萬兩、欠聯美一萬七千五百餘兩、間有給付各債權之期票者、而屆期無欵兌付、各債權乃控於特院請求判令黄楚九之兩子憲中·憲耀·與福昌經理姚繼先共同償還、並恐被告等將福昌財産藏匿、故請求先予發封、該公司旣被封閉、製烟亦因之停頓、</p>
<p>▲財産已抵押　惟自發封後　美商匯衆公司、忽延律師具狀特院、聲明該公司一切財産、皆已抵押於匯衆、其他債權、不能染指、昨晨、此案由許文鎔推事開庭傳審、原告美華等四戸、由徐士浩律師代理、而被告黄憲中憲耀則延譚毅公律師·姚繼先延吳之屏律師辯護、匯衆曁新世界飯店亦各延律師到庭參加、一爲押欵、一追房租、當經許推事諭知匯衆之律師、以抵押糾葛、不能與本案相混、如有主張、應另提起執行異議之訴、並諭知新世界飯店之律師所追欠租、亦應另案起訴、勿必牽混、該兩律師咸唯唯遵諭、</p>
<p>▲被告之辯詞　旋卽開始訊問、原告美華等四家代表控追數額、經各該原告之經理人陳述被告所欠欵項、有係貨價、有屬期票、並提出票據、證明債權數目、譚律師遂爲其當事人辯護、謂黄憲中·憲耀·對於福昌欠人債額、初不明瞭、本案各原告控追之數、大致當無錯誤、但福昌公司係屬共發公司五種營業之一、黄楚九雖任福昌總理然主　實爲共發公司、故福昌之股東、亦卽共發之股東、總理對公司祇負淸理責任、今黄楚九旣已死亡、則淸理責任、當然消滅、惟是共發公司財産、現正在着手淸理之中、股東究竟應負如何責任、刻尚談不到也、但各原告請求將福昌財産實施假扣押時所持理由、殊屬近於虛僞、蓋其所扣押之財産、實無藏匿移動之可能、今乃一旦發封、在被告固已受營業之影響、然在債權人亦無利益之可言、</p>
<p>▲擬定之辦法　許推事聆該律師所陳、卽諭以對於假扣押之處分、苟有不服、儘可依法抗告、該律師遂不贅述、而姚繼先之律師吳之屏、卽繼譚後起立聲辯、謂姚繼先實原福昌之協理、而經理則爲黄楚九也、至於各原告所控數目、自屬相符、惟福昌乃共發之一份子、福昌固未註册、卽共發亦未註册、福昌製烟所需烟葉、向由各原告供給、廢歷年底、各原告停止供給原料、遂不能不停工、查福昌之財産、約値三十萬、人欠之欵、亦有三十萬、附屬之三家影戲院、約共値十萬、此外爲股本約五六萬、而欠人方面、計欠日夜銀行八十萬、欠各戸貨欵約有四十萬、欠匯衆押欵十萬、兩抵不符四五十萬、此皆歷年之虧蝕、共發股份、黄楚九佔多數、故　昌亦係彼爲大股東、現已擬辦法數種、與債權人磋商、俾債繼少受損失、其第一種辦法、由原告仍供給原料、俾得繼續製烟發售、得欵陸續歸償、第二種將全部廠屋生財變賣、較之拍賣獲益良多、第三種出租、第四種代他公司製烟、但各原告對第一種不能許可、而第二種又非倉卒之間所能覓得受主、今惟有請求庭上權允將機器間之對條、由交义式之粘貼改爲直綫粘貼、庶使人工仍得出入機器間、製造捲烟、債權人不妨派人監視、俾福昌回復營業、而與債權亦有利益云云、</p>
<p>▲請暫緩判决　各原各之律師徐士浩卽稱、查匯衆公司曾經登報、謂福昌遘</p>
<p>之生財廠屋、均已售於匯衆、而今日據福昌律師稱僅有抵押之行爲、究竟内幕何若、外人難以明瞭、設撤銷假捉押、難保不另生意外、（匯衆之律師遂將契據呈案、但係洋文、據云並非賣契、實屬抵押）、現在事實已明、控數亦經對造承認、應請准照原告請求、依法判决、倘被告欲謀和解、而有善策、則判决後仍可提出辦法、進行和解也、吳之屏律師則仍請緩期判决、謂果判决實予和解以困難、</p>
<p>▲責任之所在　譚毅公律師旋對黄憲中·憲耀·之對本案責任加以辯論、謂福昌旣係共發公司之附屬品、則原告應先儘共發公司之財産有所主張、如共發之財産、不足以償本案之債務、始可向股東追償、然股東復非祇黄楚九一人、且此項債務、是否十九年五月之前所欠、抑在後所欠、猶是問題、故黄憲中·憲耀·實不負償還之責、應請駁斥云云、</p>
<p>▲廿八日宣判　徐士浩律師卽起辯駁、謂福昌内部組織如何、非原告所深悉、然原告所送各貨、俱蓋有福昌九星兩項回單、九星與福昌同爲黄楚九之營業、自無問題、惟福昌旣未註册、並非法人、則黄楚九當然應負完全責任、兩被告乃黄之子、更屬無可諉卸、所欠各欵、亦皆爲十九年五月以後者、尤無責任問題之可言、而譚律師復再答辯、黄子前登之報、係指黄楚九個人債務、且黄子迄未表示承襲遺産之意、並已願將乃父一切私産交出、福昌旣爲合夥性質、黄氏不能獨負責任、辯畢、許推事諭候本月二十八日上午宣判、</p>

<p>藝術界</p>
<h3>民衆藝術之新要求　唐雋</h3>
<p>丨向裝飾藝術方面開展作美代社會之基礎丨</p>
<p>因爲藝術獨立論者說社會民衆生來是與特殊的天才相對敵的、特殊的天才、根本就不是民衆所能了解的、以及藝術應得與社會民衆隔絶、應得孤獨的站在一個「象牙之塔」裏面、一般人對於民衆與藝術、便生出一個極大的誤會、說藝術不是民衆所有的、民衆是根本與藝術絶緣的、並且一聽着「民衆藝術」四字、便會大驚小怪地說、要把藝術拉下民衆的地位、那便没有藝術了、從此藝術便會喪亡了、</p>
<p>要是這樣認識「民衆藝術、」那還有什麽話可話、其實這都是一種相傳的誤會、我何在此是不能不略加辯正的、</p>
<p>「民衆藝術」的意義、不是說藝術家創作藝術、非使民衆了解不可、又非遷就民衆不可、也不是說、使一切民衆都總成爲藝術家、是說民衆對於藝術有種相當的重視和嗜好、是說民衆對於藝術有種普遍的認識力和欣賞力、換句說話、就是使民衆對於藝術的欣賞「普遍化」、使藝術的效用和權力「民衆化」、</p>
<p>因爲在某種社會、藝術的欣賞亦限於一部份人、或只限於一小部分人、藝術的效用和權力、只給予一部分人或一小部分人、所以便有（民衆藝術）的提倡、爲得使大多數的民衆都有欣賞藝術的機遇、爲得使藝術的效用和權力能給予大多數底民衆的身上、</p>
<p>一切藝術、本來都具有「民衆性」和普遍性」、其所以有時不「民衆化」或「普遍化」的、是藝術産生的以後、處置不當的問題、不是藝術本身的問題、是藝術對於民衆不得其應用的問題、不是藝術對於民衆不起感應的問題、所謂藝術民衆化是要把藝術的靈魂、廣佈到民衆的心靈裏、把藝術的形態、散佈在民衆五官的周圍、使他們的意識與感官、受着藝術權力的潛移和默化、他們雖不能從天賦的本能上創作藝術、他們却能從感官的經騐上無條件的無理由的認識藝術、欣賞藝術、</p>
<p>所以爲得使藝術民衆化、應得把大自然的空間作爲陳到藝術品的美術館、把各種藝術品、盡量地向廣大的民衆間傾泄、在某個時間民衆對於藝術的欣賞、雖不能得着相當的效果、但這不過是時</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>問的問題、而不是永久得不着感染的問題、譬如一立體派」、「未來派」以後什麽「野性派」、一超寫實派」等等藝術品、在初期發現時、西歐一般民衆多不了解、到現在却當着家常便飯了、一般婦女的帽飾和服裝上也免不掉一些立體的花紋、土木的用具上、也時時見着有或方或圓的新式綫痕、這都可以證明近代「造形藝術」（Ｄart　Plas　tioue）的精神是普遍到歐西的民衆了、）</p>
<p>然而藝術如何才能民衆化、民衆如何能普遍的藝術化、這便要向着有普遍性的藝術去哀求！向着實用裝飾美術方面去開展、爲什麽「實用裝飾美術」對於藝術民衆化、和民衆藝術化這的問題持有偌大的權力、今請說明如次、</p>
<p>因爲實用裝飾美術對於民衆是朝夕相親的、他們施行於民衆的「美化」是無限期的、民衆的感官無論若何遲鈍、若何粗礪、經過一種長時間的侵飼、總會得着相當的感染、</p>
<p>實用裝飾美術有兩種、一是純粹的實用裝飾藝術是裝飾化的純粹藝術、如「裝飾化的繪畫」（Ｐeinture　decora　tive）「裝飾化的雕刻」（soulpture　decora　tive）</p>
<p>等等、一般人所謂我們到歐西國家一抬頭便可見得美術品、這些所謂一抬頭便可見得美術品、都是裝飾他了的美術品、或逕可呼之爲裝飾藝術、於此可見歐西國家裝飾藝術之盛、</p>
<p>純粹藝術本來帶有民衆性、如果把他拿來作爲裝飾、便更有民衆性、便更使民衆對他能親切的認識、如上述所謂立體、未來等藝術其所以對於西歐的民衆能施行一種相當的權力、都是因爲他們經過了一番「裝飾化」經過一番更有「民衆性」的裝飾意味的渲染、所以民衆對這般裝飾藝術才能於無形中得受一種感染力、才能於無形中把他們的感官引入藝術的方面去開展、如果把藝術僅放在一個私人的小屋子裏、或美術館裏面、也只能使一部分人或一小部分得受其感染對於多數的民衆是不相干的、雖然民衆有時也到美術館去觀光觀光、但這只不過是一種觀光觀光而已、只不過是一種</p>
<p>「走馬看花」的情景、對於藝術的興味、究後有多大的感染、試問他們一無能有幾次到美術館去觀光、或甚至有一生没有到那裏面去踏過脚步的、</p>
<p>所以民衆藝術的提倡、是應得把藝術普遍化、把藝術散佈到民衆的周圍、使一般民衆對於藝術天天有接觸的機會、把他們的感官常常浸漬在藝術的空氣裏、這因之便造成了民衆藝術的勢力、這因之也便爲「美化社會」的工作築壘了一個堅固的基礎爲得便藝術普遍化一便須把各種藝術的形式公開出來、把各種藝術的面孔給民衆表現出來、能作這種方便的、唯有使藝術「裝飾化」唯有把藏在個人小屋子裏的藝術盡量的開放到公共城市廣大的陳列所來、能作這種方便的只有盡力的提倡裝飾藝的開展、</p>

<h3>編輯中之復旦攝影年鑑　探</h3>
<p>江灣復旦大學攝影學會、創辦的年數、雖僅三四年、然而他底歷屆影展的作品、結果却很出乎意外的、給觀衆一個很深刻的美滿印象、</p>
<p>最近這幾天、他們的中堅份子趙雲、張敏光、徐霈、曹祖光等、都是很忙的時常開會、據聞是爲着快要出版的「復日攝影年鑑」的緣故、他那年假中第一批付印的照片、業已校對完竣、現在進行付印的是最後的一批、下個月可以出版、内容舉凡花卉靜物風景人體美等等、無不盡有應有、并且所印的紙、是用最上等的黄乳色道林紙精印、更見錦上添花、美益又美、至於那些作品的由來、都是很格嚴的、從歷屆會員影展中選優拔萃、</p>
<p>丨這幾點消息、都很値我們來宣傳的、</p>
<p>講到「攝影年鑑」、在歐美各國、早已很風行的發達、反觀我國的攝影藝術界、近幾年雖有猛進的現象、然而發起出版」中國攝影年鑑一的呼聲、前年纔聽到、但却尚未見其實、（雖然郎靜山但杜宇等有過個人的攝影集問世、）這大約優美照片之難於徵集、但是社會同我們一班對於攝影藝術底價値、没有相當的認識、也許要算最大主因之一嗎、</p>
<p>現在、「復日攝影年鑑」快要出版了、我們除熱烈的欣喜外、切誠地希望年鑑的保母丨編輯先生丨善爲愛護、那未這足以轟動攝影藝術界的「年鑑、」也許可以同我們所想像的美滿成績相吻合、</p>
<h3>因果　翼</h3>
<p>第一課的鐘聲響了、同學們很馴服的在響亮的鐘聲之下彳亍的走入教室去求那無涯的學問、散課時幾無立錐之地的操場平時擁擠得水洩不通的草地、但是到了現在、連孤零零的人影都找不到一個、大的學校、因爲有了一千五六百的學生、平時嘈雜得什麽似的、可是上課的鐘聲、能夠結束一切、除掉教員的講解聲、以及風吹樹木颯颯作聲而外、再也聽不到旁的聲音、</p>
<p>王君坐位隔壁的史君、乘着講師遲到的餘暇、把愷女士寄給李君的「鸞和求得、」（按Ｌove　Letter之譯音）給君看了一遍、那信的内容、因爲我和王君坐位的距離尚還不遠、所以被我看見了一個大概、總而言之、不外無關緊要的幾句肉麻閒話、我和李君的交誼、也有很悠久的歷史、恕吾不將信的内容宣佈了、蠧蠧的皮鞋聲、從遠而近、手中提着皮包的一位外國「蜜司」隨着皮鞋聲而踏進了教室、王同史的談話、就此中止、很靜的都聽着教員的講着課本、</p>
<p>散課之後、史君這樣的向我說、（昨天午後、我從外面買了一些東西回校、經過門房的時候、齊巧砰到送信的郵差、送來了一束信札、我乘便看了一看、李的信、就是這裏拿到的、因爲我同李君是同寢室的、所以很有些知道寄這信的發信人、並且能夠斷定是一封「ＬＬ」昨晚吾實在無聊極了、同室的李君、又没有來校、寢室中賸下的、祗有我一人、於是將李的信拆了開來、另外抄了一張、仍舊替他很謹愼小心的封好、我的手段眞正高明、當吾在今天早上交這封信給李的時候、他並没察破這信被拆的破綻、居然還道謝吾「聲、」</p>
<p>不到二天、李又有信了、史君又要重試故技、但是這一次的結果、非但没有看見信中的絲毫、彷彿告訴李君上一次的一封信、也被人拆過的、因爲正在動手的當兒、冷不防闖入了這信的受信人來、這時候的史君、弄得手足無措的不知怎樣回答他好友、同時他的面部、立刻陳列著一朶一朶的紅雲、好像向着李表示十三分的歉意、</p>
<p>天氣因爲時令的關係而轉冷了、許多的同學手中拿了熱水袋、坐在面南的大禮堂的前面、向着一只天然的大火爐丨太陽丨求暖、一陣胡閙的聲浪、衝動了我的耳膜、爲好奇心駕御着的我、自然而然的循着聲浪的發源地而尋去、走在校中的走廊之中、又聽見「誰作此惡劇、」「没有道德心已達於極點了、」</p>
<p>「·········情書·······」幾句話</p>
<p>我聽得這些話後、好像在五里霧中似的什麽都辨别不來、直到了房間裏才知道史君「的信」也被人拆看了、可憐的史君、現在還没有知道什麽一回事呢、胡閙的所以發生、也大概爲了這一封信吧</p>

<h3>German Alertness to Soviet Russia's Industrial Plan</h3>
<p>Since the Soviet Union implemented its Five-Year Industrial Plan, most European and American countries believed it would fail. Therefore, although they feared it, they did not pay much attention to it. Recently, Stalin declared at the Soviet Russian Industrial Council that the Five-Year Industrial Plan is progressing gradually and is expected to succeed. The program to increase production by 45% this year is currently being implemented. The economic future of Soviet Russia is promising. Although his words are close to boasting, considering the opinion published today in Berlin dispatches by the famous French financier Balmontel after inspecting Soviet Russia, it also says that Soviet Russia's industrial plan, regardless, can definitely be completed by 75% or 80%. At that time, the world economy will undergo a great terror. Its position is sufficient to destroy the industries of various countries. The impact is especially significant on countries that rely solely on export trade, such as England and Germany. Therefore, the German newspapers have paid great attention to this article. The Deutsche Zeitung even said that countries are still selling machines and materials to Russia, or lending technical experts to complete their industrial plans, I am afraid that they will harm themselves. It can be seen that they are very vigilant. Stalin once said that the recent course of the world economy is not only a turning point for the Soviet Union, but also a turning point for capitalist countries. In the Soviet Union, the economy is developing day by day, while in capitalist countries, the economy is declining. We know that in the future, various industrial countries will no longer ignore the Soviet Union's industrial plan as before. However, considering the Geneva dispatch yesterday, the Economic Committee of the League of Nations rejected the motion proposed by the French representative seeking to jointly resist the dumping of goods from Soviet Russia, it can be seen that the opinions of various countries on Soviet Russia are still not unified.</p>

<h3>U.S. Senate Passes Pittman Resolution</h3>
<p>Will Appeal to the President to Find a Way to Save Silver Prices</p>
<p>And Will Convene an International Conference When Necessary</p>
<p>New York Silver Market Still Trending Downward</p>
<p>▲Associated Press, Washington, 20th The Senate today passed a resolution proposed by the Pittman Committee urging the President to find a way to resolve the global decline in silver prices. With the Senate's passage, it is now planned to request President Hoover to begin consultations with various governments to prevent abnormal fluctuations in silver prices and, when necessary, to convene an international conference to negotiate methods for using silver as subsidiary currency. However, the resolution passed by the Senate did not involve Pittman's proposal to lend a large amount of raw silver to China to stimulate world commerce and raise silver prices. As for whether to lend silver to China, it will be entirely determined by the international conference convened by President Hoover. However, whether it is necessary to convene this conference is up to Mr. Hoover's discretion. The White House has not yet revealed how it will implement the Pittman resolution passed by the Senate today. Although Washington officials are deeply concerned about the silver issue, silver prices are still fluctuating. According to today's report from New York, American silver bars closed at 26 and 1/4, down 3/4 from yesterday's 27.</p>

<h3>The Labor Union Law is Under Attack on All Sides</h3>
<p>Submitted to the Japanese Parliament by the Government</p>
<p>Almost Entirely Loses the Spirit of the Original Proposal</p>
<p>▲Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: The Labor Union Law proposed by the Ministry of the Interior was officially announced yesterday after a Cabinet decision and submitted to Parliament on the 21st. The House of Representatives will include it on the agenda on the 24th. It differs slightly from the original proposal of the Social Affairs Bureau, namely that the purpose of the labor union is only to maintain and improve labor conditions, and that those who can establish unions are limited to those engaged in occupations or industries, and third parties are not allowed to join. Furthermore, the collection of election expenses is strictly prohibited. The content of the bill has a completely restrictive view of the labor union movement.</p>
<p>▲Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: There are many objections to the Labor Union Law proposed by the government. The Proletarian Party said that this bill only seeks the convenience of capitalists and loses its original spirit. Even the mediation bill has been worsened and cannot be approved at all. The government completely altered the bill when it was submitted to Parliament, which is deceiving the public. Various labor unions have decided to hold a meeting today to discuss countermeasures, and a nationwide mass movement is showing signs of breaking out. Capitalists are also opposing this bill, and this opposition is reflected in the House of Peers. According to the opinions of various factions in the House of Peers, the government has accommodated the strong opinions of capitalists, lost the spirit of the original proposal of the Social Affairs Bureau, and submitted it to Parliament. This is because the government has already declared that it will formulate a Labor Union Law and has to use this to perfunctorily fulfill its position. The government's true intention is to hope that the Upper House will not complete its deliberations and shift the responsibility for the bill's failure to the Upper House, engaging in cunning tricks to shirk responsibility. Young members of the Minseitō Party said that the government's bill completely loses the essence of the Social Affairs Bureau's bill and has no value at all. Even the revision of the mediation law is only worsening it. Criticism is very high. There are also opinions from both labor and capital within the Seiyūkai Party, but they cannot oppose the formulation of the Labor Union Law from the front. In order to cater to public opinion, they intend to oppose the bill on the grounds that they cannot approve of the Labor Union Law, which has no essence, and the worsened mediation law, and request that a complete bill be submitted again, forcing the government to withdraw it. In short, this bill is under attack on all sides, and it is difficult to pass the House of Peers. As a result, it may pass the Lower House when the session is approaching, but be shelved in the Upper House.</p>

<h3>Future World Economic Terror</h3>
<p>Once the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan Succeeds</p>
<p>It Will Be More Than Enough to Destroy Industries in Various Countries</p>
<p>Observations of a Famous French Financier</p>
<p>▲National News, Berlin, 20th: French financier Paul Mommer, who previously attended the Dawes and Young Plan meetings, recently inspected the Soviet Union and returned to the country. He published his views in the Parisian Morning Post, saying that the Soviet Union's five-year industrial plan will definitely be completed by 75 or 80 percent. At that time, it will be a major terror for the world economy. Its position will be sufficient to destroy industries in various countries, especially those that rely heavily on export trade, such as Britain and Germany. For example, in the iron casting sector, the Soviet Union will be able to produce 17 million tons within two years and export 10 million tons. Other industrial products are also making the same rapid progress. The impact on other countries' industries can be seen in the case of oil. Due to its abundant production and low cost, it has reduced world oil prices by half, causing the largest oil companies in Europe and America to face serious difficulties. German newspapers attached great importance to this article and reprinted it with comments. For example, the Vossische Zeitung said that Germany and Russia are the closest, and even if there is no need to panic like the Morning Post, we should always be mindful of the economic consequences after the completion of the Soviet industrial plan. The German newspaper of the Catholic Centre Party, the Deutsche Zeitung, said that Mr. Mommer's words are entirely based on clear-headed economic observations, without any emotional intention, and must be considered accurate and credible. Now, various countries are still selling machinery and materials to Russia and providing technical experts to help them complete the five-year plan, which is not far from courting disaster and will eventually harm themselves.</p>

<h3>Record of the Inauguration of the Shanxi Provincial Committee</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Communication: The newly appointed Acting Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, Shang Zhen, and committee members Chang Bingyi, Zhang Weiqing, Guo Baoqing, and others, held a swearing-in ceremony at the Provincial Government Auditorium at 10:00 AM yesterday. The Secretariat of the Provincial Government specially issued a notice the night before, requesting various agencies and organizations to send representatives to observe the ceremony.</p>
<p>(1) Shang Zhen (2) Miao Peicheng (3) Zhang Weiqing</p>
<p>(4) Guo Baoqing (5) Chang Bingyi</p>
<p>Approximately 300 to 400 representatives attended. The venue was decorated in an extremely solemn manner, with tables and chairs in the center and a bouquet of flowers. The seats for guests were filled on both the east and west sides, and the military band stood in the courtyard. When the clock struck ten, Shang, accompanied by the Central Supervisor Miao Peicheng, committee members Chang Bingyi, Guo Baoqing, Zhang Weiqing, and others, walked from the Provincial Government Reception Hall to the auditorium. After entering the auditorium, the military band played loudly. Shang and Miao were all dressed in ordinary formal attire. After taking their seats, Miao sat in the center, with Shang and the committee members arranged on both sides. After the ceremony, Shang read the oath on behalf of everyone, saying: "I solemnly swear that I will abide by the will of the Premier, obey the laws of the Party and the country, be loyal and diligent in my duties, I will never waste a penny, use a person wrongly, and I will never engage in corruption or accept bribes. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This I swear." Next, Miao Peicheng delivered a speech, saying in summary: "Chairman and committee members, representatives, today is the day when the Shanxi Provincial Government is reorganized and Chairman Shang and the committee members are sworn into office. I have been sent by the Central Government to supervise the oath-taking ceremony. I have three feelings about participating in this meeting, which I would like to present for the reference of the Chairman and committee members: (1) Shanxi is in the aftermath of a major war, and the scars have not yet healed. Although it has been several months, it has still not been able to recover. The voices of the disaster-stricken people in various places continue to reach our ears. At the time of the establishment of the new government, it is hoped that local relief will be handled quickly and social order will be stabilized. (2) Now is the period of political tutelage, and local self-government is extremely important. Now that the provincial government is reorganized, I hope to work hard to guide local self-government so that the people have the ability to govern themselves. (3) Shanxi has stubbornly clung to old habits for the past ten years, and many systems and regulations are no longer applicable today. I hope that after the reorganization of the provincial government, we can start anew and completely eliminate all the bad habits and bad regulations that are outdated and stagnant." Next, Hu Boyue, the representative of the Provincial Party Department, and Yang Derong, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, delivered speeches one after another, both hoping to show determination and perseverance to do things for the people and to promote local self-government. Finally, Shang Zhen, on behalf of the committee members, gave a reply, saying: "Central Supervisor, representatives of the Provincial and Municipal Party Departments, representatives from all walks of life, comrades, I am honored and grateful for your presence and guidance today. From now on, we will respectfully abide by the Party's doctrine and program, the Premier's instructions and teachings, and the various points instructed by the Central Supervisor and the representatives, and strive to realize them with twelve points of enthusiasm and effort. We will also abide by the Central Government's laws, be mindful of the people's suffering, eliminate all the malpractices of the past government, and do our best to seek welfare for the people of the province. As for the detailed methods and implementation procedures, we will formulate a comprehensive plan after taking office so that we can implement it. We are but thin and weak in talent and strength, and we still hope that you comrades will provide guidance at any time so that we can follow and not be mistaken. This is especially what we hope for." After Shang finished his reply, he went to the outside of the auditorium with everyone and took a photo together before dispersing. After supervising the oath-taking ceremony, Miao Peicheng went directly to the station and took the Zhengtai train at noon to leave Bing and return to Beijing to report. The reason why the committee members were so eager to take office was because Miao had to leave Jin that day. After Shang and the committee members took office, they issued a telegram of assuming office. The original text is as follows: Urgent: Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Presidents of each Yuan, various departments, various committee members, various provincial and municipal governments, various provincial and municipal party headquarters, various legal entities, various newspapers, all for reference: According to the National Government's order of January 31, appointing Shang Zhen, Zhang Jixin, Chang Bingyi, Feng Sizhi, Qiu Zengyi, Zhang Weiqing, Guo Maiqing, Li Shangren, and Hu Yiling as members of the Shanxi Provincial Government this order; appointing Shang Zhen concurrently as Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government this order; appointing Shang Zhen concurrently as Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of the Shanxi Provincial Government, Zhang Jixin concurrently as Director of the Department of Finance of the Shanxi Provincial Government, Feng Sizhi concurrently as Director of the Department of Education of the Shanxi Provincial Government, Qiu Zengyi concurrently as Director of the Department of Construction of the Shanxi Provincial Government, and Chang Bingyi concurrently as Director of the Department of Agriculture and Industry of the Shanxi Provincial Government, this order, etc. In accordance with this, we took the oath of office at 9:00 AM today. We are unworthy of such a new mandate and fear that the times are difficult and the responsibility is heavy. We hope that you will give us advice from time to time so that we can follow and not be mistaken. We pray without end. Shang Zhen, Zhang Jixin, Chang Bingyi, Feng Sizhi, Qiu Zengyi, Zhang Weiqing, Guo Baoqing, Li Shangren, and Hu Yiling respectfully request deletion. (February 16)</p>
<h3>Wang Jinyu Establishes Bandit Suppression Headquarters in Nanchang</h3>
<p>▲Has Sent Chief of Staff to Nanchang to Make Arrangements</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Wang Jinyu, Bandit Suppression Commissioner for the borders of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, has sent his Chief of Staff Qi Xiangchen to Jiangxi to meet with He Yingqin to request instructions on the bandit suppression strategy for the borders of the three provinces and to report on the progress of the bandit suppression. After arriving in the province, Qi visited He at the headquarters and then went to visit Commander-in-Chief Lu at his residence in Beitan, and also visited Mayor Gong at the Municipal Government, preparing to establish a three-province bandit suppression headquarters in the provincial capital. Wang Jinyu will not come to Nanchang to command everything until the arrangements are in order. Because the joint suppression by the three provinces must first clear out the Jiangxi bandits. It is reported that the 54th Division, commanded by Hao Mengling, is currently stationed in Xiushui, and Hao has also taken office as Chairman of the Xiushui Bandit Suppression Zone Committee. The 43rd Division, commanded by Guo Huazong, has arrived in the area of Wanzai, Lianhua, and Anfu, and has established contact with friendly forces in eastern Hunan and western Jiangxi. The 47th Division is also advancing towards the borders of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. In the future, part of Chen Cheng's division will also come to Jiangxi to join the bandit suppression. Therefore, the bandit communists in Jiangxi can be expected to be cleared in a short period of time. (February 19)</p>
<h3>Li Mingzhong and Others Request the Abolition of Additional Security Fees in Henan</h3>
<p>Li Mingzhong, Liu Zhenhua, and others sent a telegram to Chairman Liu of Henan, saying: "Chairman Liu Jingfu, with respect. We believe that the way to govern well is to prioritize a sufficient army with sufficient food, and the way to stop chaos is to emphasize both nurturing and protecting the people. In recent years, the central government, with the intention of relieving suffering, sent troops to suppress violence and save the people. Great chaos has been quelled repeatedly, and the country is unified. Repeated proclamations have been issued to allow the people to rest, and benevolent words and benefits have been widely spread, admired by all. Moreover, Henan Province has suffered from frequent years of drought and has been at the center of successive wars. The granaries are empty, and scars are everywhere. Your Excellency deeply cares for the people's suffering and vigorously plans for pacification. The remaining breaths are gradually reviving, and we are fortunate to see the day of yearning for good governance. Harsh taxes are pending, especially at a time when they are on the verge of death. Recently, we have seen the provincial government's security team measures, establishing a headquarters in the provincial capital and forming four regiments, requiring more than 200,000 yuan in monthly expenses. A security fee of 60 cents is added to each tael of land tax, implemented from the 20th year [of the Republic] and extended to six districts in the province. The expenses for the security teams in each district are still raised locally, amounting to no less than several million yuan. According to the Ministry of Finance's circular, the surtax on land should not exceed one times the regular tax. In some counties in Henan Province, it exceeds several times, and some report the correct amount but still arbitrarily apportion the taxes. This time, the Department of Finance telegraphed instructions to the counties to separately review and reduce the additional amounts for education, construction, public security, police, self-government, and local militias, and to increase the security fees separately, hoping to avoid the name of exceeding the tax. Although the wording does not violate the Ministry's order, in reality</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>, it greatly increases the burden. Now that political tutelage has begun, the key to local administration is to reflect and catch up. If the old amount of local fees is reduced due to the new increase in security fees, judging from the principles of things, it is not proper. Moreover, the education, construction, public security, self-government, local militias, and other expenses of each county have fixed amounts and regular uses, which cannot be reduced by empty words. Ultimately, it is feared that the old ones will not be reduced, and the new ones will be permanently added, causing the small people to suffer skinning pain. Furthermore, speaking in terms of the nature of the local militias and the security teams, the local militias are the people's self-defense force, and the security teams are the provincial government's force for maintaining public order. Therefore, the expenses of the local militias should be borne by the people, and the expenses of the security teams should be provided by the provincial treasury according to Article 19 of the organizational regulations promulgated by the central government. The war responsibilities and military expenses are planned in an orderly manner. If the funds for the local militias are diverted for security fees, it is like cutting feet to fit shoes. If the increase in security fees causes a heavy burden on the people, it is like drinking poison to quench thirst. However, if the government intends to concentrate military force and achieve the effect of command and control, it can be said that although the local area increases its burden, the government still receives its effect, and it can also be said that although the people increase their huge burden, they still obtain the price of security. However, we, those in charge, based on internal information, believe that this is not the case. Tracing back to the time when Governor Zhao was in office during the 10th year of the Republic, he formed dozens of battalions of local patrol teams, with salaries taken from the local area and soldiers forcibly taken from the local militias. However, during the Zhili-Fengtian War, they abandoned their armor and dragged their weapons, collapsing and scattering like a warehouse. They were not enough to maintain anything in an emergency. Last year, Feng occupied Henan Province and forcibly formed local militia armies in various counties in an attempt to increase his personal power. In the end, the militia disintegrated, and the fog and smoke dissipated. A crowd of rabble-rousers instantly turned into nothing. The local militia is essentially a self-defense group, not a combat force. The salaries and weapons of the local militia are tools for protecting the people and should not be used as weapons of war. To covet the false name of centralized power is to receive the real disaster of making enemies. The repeated mistakes and lessons are not far away. Zhenhua and others belong to the common people and have more direct observations. For the sake of the provincial government's maintenance of the local area and for the sake of reducing the people's suffering in Henan, rather than taking the risk of cutting flesh to treat sores, it is better to plan for bending chimneys and moving firewood. We dare to offer our humble opinions and attach our loyal advice. Our public pain is held in our arms, and we hope for your understanding. We earnestly request that you issue a general order to all counties to abolish the additional security fees to alleviate the people's difficulties. If it is deemed that security urgently needs to be arranged and the people cannot bear any more burdens, it seems appropriate to adjust the existing budget within the provincial treasury and find other ways to benefit both security and alleviate difficulties. We respectfully telegraph our sincere intentions and hope for your consideration. Brothers Li Mingzhong, Ji Hongchang, Liang Guanying, and Liu Zhenhua bow with seals. Also, a telegram to Chief of Staff Liu: "Chief of Staff Liu Shishang, with respect. Parting at Dongmen has been toiling. Recently, we heard that the Department of Finance of the provincial government issued a general order to add 60 cents of security fees to the land tax in the 20th year and remit the full amount to the province. In addition, the expenses for the security teams under the jurisdiction of the six districts are still to be raised separately by the local areas. Our region has suffered from frequent years of drought, the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted, and the survivors after the calamity cannot bear this. We have witnessed the suffering and speak out for the people. We have telegraphed Chairman Jingfu, earnestly requesting that he consider the people's hardships and find other ways. We hope for your understanding. We believe that the establishment of the security teams is originally intended to maintain local public order. According to the regulations promulgated by the central government, the expenses should be provided by the provincial treasury. If this huge amount heavily burdens the people, we sincerely fear that security will not be achieved and the people's lives will be exhausted. We have no choice but to take this step of shouting out. Our brother is deeply concerned about his homeland, and his heart for loving his hometown is closely related and even more urgent than ours. We hope that you will explain in detail to all colleagues in charge and strive to mediate before Chairman Jingfu to express our humble sincerity. Then, the tens of millions of dying people in our Henan will feel the boundless grace of a great man. We offer our sincerity with urgency. Brothers Li Mingzhong, Ji Hongchang, Liang Guanying, and Liu Zhenhua bow with seals."</p>
<h3>The Loss of Haiyuan Pavilion's Collection of Books to Bandit Dens</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: A portion of the Haiyuan Pavilion collection of books belonging to the Yang family in Liaocheng was transported to Jinan and preserved by the stepmother of the book owner, Yang Jingfu. Another portion was transported to the Chang residence of Lao Zhi in Tianjin. The other portion was looted by the bandit gang of Xue Chuanfeng and Wang Jinfeng when they occupied Liaocheng. It has now been scattered to Baoding, and the ones sold are not included. As for the portion transported to Jinan, the Department of Education has repeatedly negotiated with them and proposed three methods to preserve it. However, the old Mrs. Yang did not trust the government and repeatedly made excuses and delayed, and the negotiations have come to no results. Yang Jingfu, on the other hand, claimed to be ill in Tianjin and did not come to Jinan. Therefore, this matter is currently at a standstill. However, it is heard that twelve kinds have been sold to the Japanese for 80,000 yuan. In addition to the Song edition of Meng Dongye's Collection and the Liao family's Liuzhou Collection from the Shicai Hall, there is also a Song edition of Zhuangzi, which is also a unique copy in the country. The Liuzhou Collection was only priced at 8,000 yuan, which can be said to be of good quality and low price. Recently, Rong Guangxing, the brigade commander of the 87th Brigade of the 29th Division of the Third Route Army, was suppressing bandits in Boping and discovered the Haiyuan Pavilion collection of books in the bandit's residence. However, it was already badly damaged. The brigade immediately telegraphed a report to the province, which stated: "On the 15th of this month, the commander of our brigade personally led the entire Second Regiment and the pistol team to various counties for guerrilla warfare. It was reported that in Suoti, Boping, there were bandit leaders Dafengzi Wang Erbiandan who were summoning bandit troops, hoping to disturb the local area. This bandit once served as a battalion commander under Wang Guanjun. When the Wang bandits occupied Liaocheng, they stole many treasures from the Yang residence. We immediately secretly ordered the pistol team to surround Suoti and the bandit's residence at dawn. Led by the villagers, they entered the courtyard to search. Unexpectedly, the bandits had already heard the news and fled. We arrested their father and more than ten suspects and escorted them back to the brigade headquarters for strict interrogation. At the same time, we found several pages of calligraphy and painting in the courtyard, which were indeed owned by the Yang residence, but they were badly damaged. It is heard that the valuable ones had already been transported elsewhere. On the 16th, the pistol team went to the West Civilization District and captured Pang Yuchun, a major bandit from Liaocheng. On the 17th, they closed the city gates again, checked the household registrations, and acted swiftly in various counties, causing great shock. The bandits have already disappeared, and at the same time, we jointly issued a notice with the county magistrates to appease the people, and the people's hearts are greatly stabilized. Special report, Chief of Staff's Office of the 87th Brigade, Qiaoyin." (20th day)</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Joint Suppression of Bandits by Land and Naval Forces, Police, and Army, Ji The bandit Tai Bao Ah Shu is scattered throughout the towns of Songjiang and Jinshan. The troops stationed in Songjiang have repeatedly dispatched teams to suppress them. However, the area has many river branches, and the bandits and villagers wear the same clothing, making it difficult to distinguish between good and bad. On the 18th, at 12:00 PM, the land and naval forces, police, and army were each divided into a column and set off in six routes. Zhang Ruyu, the battalion commander of the Fifth Division, Bai, the battalion commander of the security team, Fan, the captain of the water police, Ren, the company commander of the Fifth Division, Tan, the captain of the Jinshan water patrol, Yang Shi, the inspector of the Songjiang Public Security Bureau and the secret service chief of the Jinshan Clearing Office, and Fan, the squad leader, each led elite troops and set off from their stationed locations. They were to gather at Xinmiao to conduct a major search. The Zhejiang Pinghu also sent a security team to come and join them. In the early stages, the small ports were sealed off. From 12:00 PM onwards, until dawn, the sound of gunfire continued from all directions. In this campaign, Tai Bao Ah Shu and others had already fled Xinmiao several hours earlier. It is rumored that they had fallen into the sea to escape. Only the third route led by Captain Tan, Detective Yang, and Squad Leader Fan set off from Zhang and arrived at Kongjiaque. They caught a glimpse of a flash of electricity and searched forward without success. They turned to Langxia and arrived at Majiahui at 5:00 AM and intercepted</p>
<p>two bandits, Liu Badi and Gao Erer, who confessed to the location of the hidden ransom slips. They were escorted to the Ma Jinxiang family and rescued seven hostages who had been kidnapped from Xinhuang. Five hostages were also found in the Ma Ahe family. The bandits watching the hostages had all escaped and were lying on the river beach. They were searched and captured by Detective Yang, Captain Tan, and others, totaling seven people. Among them was Jin Qisheng, the younger brother of Jin Fei, and Gao Erer, Gao Ersan, Liu Atao, and others who were the most vicious. The various routes then gathered, and the third route brought the hostages and bandits back to Zhang. After interrogation by Battalion Commander Zhang and others, Jin Qisheng confessed that he was 24 years old, from Qianwei, and had served as a police officer. Last June, he followed the Tai Bao Ah Shu gang to rob Jinjiazhuang and other places. On the fourth day of the eleventh month, he followed Xu Tianmin (Tai Bao Ah Shu's younger brother), Wang Meimei (Pig</p>
<p>Ah Mei), Lu Yaosheng, and others and obtained nineteen hostages. Tai Bao Ah Shu took three, and Wang Meimei took the rest to wait for ransom. The day before,</p>
<p>they gathered many people in Mahui to kidnap Xie Yuchun from Jiangzhuang and six others.</p>
<p>According to Gao Erer, who was also from Qianwei, he was rowing boats for Ah Bao Taishu in December. The Shen Youche kidnapping case was planned at Huxiao Bridge behind Liujiayan Bridge. The other criminals all confessed without denying. Jin Qisheng, Gao Erer, and two others were executed by firing squad at Zhangyan Yaotou on the 20th. Liu Badi and the other three were scheduled to be executed by firing squad in Zhangyan today. An empty boat and three rifles seized from the bandits in Xinmiao have been brought back. It is reported that the bandits abandoned their boats and landed to escape because they were surrounded by land and naval forces, police, and army and the river ports were sealed off. The twelve hostages rescued were Jiang Jusheng, Chen Guofu, Yao Shaozhou, Jin Pan</p>
<p>, Xu Chunlin, Xu Huiren, Xu Shaogui, Wang Yaoshan, Zhu Fukang, Zheng Lizhang, Lu Fengqing, and Dai Chenshi, who were businessmen. Ten of them returned to Song today and took a car back to He, and the other two had to wait for their families to come and claim them.</p>
<p>The Kidnapping Case of the Zhu Family in Wuku is Resolved The Zhu Anda family of Zhangcunbang, Wuku Thirty-Eight Tu was kidnapped by bandits at the end of the lunar year. Anda's children and a nephew were kidnapped, and there was no news for a long time. The family was anxious. It is now known that all those kidnapped were escaped from the Qingpu Tangbian on New Year's Eve and arrived safely at home that night. The whole family was happy.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>The Kidnapping of Fang Baolong Demands a Ransom of 100,000 After Fang Baolong and his grandson, residents of Xiao Jing, Sian Bridge, were kidnapped by bandits at the end of January, it is now known that the family received a letter from the bandits demanding a ransom of 100,000 yuan. The contact location is Liuhe Town, which belongs to Taicang County. It is said that the Fang family has used all its wealth, which is less than 100,000. It is unknown how to redeem them.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Frequent Bandit Alarms in Wu and Wu Jiang The areas of Luli and Wu Jiang have had bandit gangs arriving from Zhejiang province last night. There are 30 or 40 bandit ships, intending to take advantage of the New Year to rob the town when the defenses are weak. The water police team stationed there detected this and dispatched a team to block them. The bandits still fled back to Zhejiang province.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Sentencing of Zhou Runshi and Others Zhou Runshi, a police inspector of the Civil Affairs Department, was staying with Zhou Xingzhen, the concubine of Shen Xiang, in Wuxi. Shen presented a complaint, and the county government transferred Zhou Runshi and others to the county court. Prosecutor Zhou opened the court and acquitted Zhou Runshi and others. According to the Law on Violations of Police Regulations, they were sent to the Public Security Bureau for sentencing. As the fixed period was not yet over, they were still detained. Yesterday, the fixed period expired, and the court sent a letter to the county government. The county government then issued a letter to the Public Security Bureau for sentencing. In the afternoon, at around 2:00 PM, Director Wang opened the court and sentenced Zhou Runshi, Zhou Xingzhen, and Wang Yuhong (all prostitutes) to a fine of 15 yuan each according to the Law on Violations of Police Regulations. Wang Chongxi (former director of the Eighth Branch Bureau) was fined 30 yuan, Qin Enrui (former member of the Third Branch Bureau) was fined 15 yuan, and Jin Qiugen (room service in the New World Hotel, No. 83) was fined 15 yuan. After receiving the sentence, each person immediately paid the fine and was released. The case of the police inspector's prostitution has now been completely concluded.</p>
<p>Banning Illegal Shipping After the sinking of the Hengyi steamboat of the Taili Company in this town on the 14th of this month, which resulted in the drowning of ten passengers, most passengers are wary. The Suzhou Customs Supervisory Office believed that twelve steamboats from the Northeast Jisang and other steamboat companies in this town, such as Xiangyu and Xiangyuan, should have been repaired annually, but they had not yet sailed to the customs to comply with the regulations for re-inspection, which obviously intended to delay and posed a great danger to the lives and property of passengers. The office issued an order to the Construction Bureau of this town the day before to strictly ban each vessel in order to comply with the regulations. After receiving the order, Director Yao issued a notice to the steamship industry office yesterday, instructing each steamboat company to suspend operations immediately.

<p>The Postponement of the Opening of the Money Industry in the Market The Wuyi Commercial Market ended at the end of the lunar year, which was greatly affected by the rain and snow. Therefore, many industries were unable to settle accounts with the money industry as usual. Some money industries also failed to clear the Suzhou Zhuang accounts. For this reason, the money industry was hesitant to issue bills and conduct transactions for each industry. Some money shops themselves also had a small number of unsettled accounts. In previous years, the money industry would open on the fourth or fifth day of the lunar new year, but this year, due to the different circumstances, it was necessary to extend the time until the 26th of this month (the tenth day of the lunar year).</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>The Merger of the Two Pu and Qingcun Salt Fields The Song salt field has five fields: Yuanpu, Chongming, Xiasan, Qingcun, and Liangpu. After the Ministry of Finance sent personnel to investigate this time, it was considered that the situation of each field was vastly different from the past, and it was necessary to make changes. The three fields of Qingcun, Yuanpu, and Liangpu are not only geographically close but also have very similar products. The output of salt is less than that of farmland, and the affairs are particularly simple. Therefore, it was proposed to merge the Qingpu and Liangpu fields into the Yuanpu field in a moderate location for nearby management. A report has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance, and the field director, Li Yaonan, will be sent to take over separately. An official announcement was made yesterday that all affairs of the two fields will be directly under the jurisdiction of the field from this month onwards. However, the original collection offices of the field will be changed to branch counters for the convenience of the people to pay taxes and will be postponed for abolition.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The Issue of Appeasement for the Lvsi Sea Bandits The sea bandits entrenched in the Lvsi area have undergone several internal conflicts. Recently, the remnant gang of Yan Zhendai, with over 300 bandits, requested appeasement from the district office, willing to clear the ocean surface of Yonghai and Qiru and hand over all their weapons. District Chief Cheng presented the request to the county government and forwarded it to the military and political authorities for approval.</p>
<p>The Re-establishment of Urban and Rural Telephone Lines The Nantong city telephone poles were broken by heavy snow, and the telephone lines were completely destroyed. Restoration is difficult. It has been decided to re-install the lines, which will take three months to restore telephone service.</p>
<p>The Difficulty of Handling the Upgrading of Reed Fields to Taxable Land The provincial government sent Jiang Yongyi to Nantong to handle the upgrading of reed fields to taxable land. After arriving in Nantong, Commissioner Jiang found that the registers were incomplete and there was no way to verify them. It was particularly difficult to make up for them. He specially reported to the province for instructions on how to proceed.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>An Overview of the Closure of the Zhenjiang Commercial Market The accounts of all industries in the Zhenjiang commercial sector were closed on the 16th of this month. Traditionally, the money industry had the most surplus. Last year, due to the impact of the collapse of money shops in various counties in Jiangbei, the losses amounted to more than 1.1 million. Therefore, except for a few shops such as Yuan Yi, Yuan Sheng, and Heng Yuan, whose business conditions were different and not greatly affected, and had a surplus, the rest of the shops all suffered losses. Before the accounts were closed, the lack of silver dollars in Zhenjiang caused the shops to rampantly drive up prices, which greatly affected various industries. Later, the managers of Yuan Sheng and Dingchang shops transferred several million silver dollars from Shanghai to Zhenjiang to maintain the market and avoid huge losses. In addition, the foreign goods industry and the gold industry had a considerable surplus due to the increase in gold and pounds. As for the silk and cloth industry, the northern goods industry, the rice industry, the wood industry, and the tea industry, although there was not much surplus, they were generally stable.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>A Robbery and Kidnapping Case Discovered in Daqiao Town Daqiao Town, located in the western part of this county and bordering Jiangyin, is a small market town with dozens of households, none of which are very wealthy. At around 2:00 AM on the 18th of this month, more than 20 robbers, all armed with guns, first robbed the Wu Gengsheng family, taking away clothing and silver dollars. Then, they went to the neighboring Zhang Guisheng family (some say Lu), but Zhang was quite poor and had nothing of value to rob. This angered the robbers, who kidnapped Zhang, intending to demand a ransom. When they reached the vicinity of Majing Bridge, Zhang pleaded with the bandit leader to release him. The bandits, seeing his pitiful situation, released him. Later, they went to the Qian Sansi and Qian Genquan families in that area. Because the Qian family had sold rice last year and accumulated hundreds of silver dollars, all of these were taken away by the bandits, along with some valuable clothing. Sansi and Genquan were both injured when they resisted the bandits and have already gone to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, their lives are not in danger. The total loss for the four families is estimated to be around a thousand gold.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Zhu Xingnan Will Be Sent to the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters Zhu Xingnan, a resident of Xiagang, was arrested in Suzhou and sent to the Zhenjiang Security Office in September last year for a reactionary case, and then transferred to the Temporary Military Law Joint Trial Office. He has been suffering from a severe illness in detention recently. His abandoned wife, Shen Yunzhen, requested the Security Office to release him on bail for medical treatment. The reply was that the case was ordered by the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters to be sent to Beijing for interrogation, and the request for bail for medical treatment could not be approved. He should be treated properly before being sent on the journey.</p>
<p>Establishment of Confidential Report Boxes in the Four Cities The First District Office received an order from the county government to establish confidential report boxes in its jurisdiction in accordance with the resolution of the Defense Conference, to collect information. The boxes will be opened and closed by the district chief himself. If there are any confidential reports, the district chief should immediately work with the police and militia to handle them properly. After receiving the order, District Chief Zhu set up the boxes in the four cities yesterday.</p>
<p>Inquiring about the Method for the Remaining Prisoner Food and Funds The county government received an order from the High Court the day before, stating that Jiangyin was allocated 30 prisoners' food rations for convicts whose cases had been concluded, which would be paid from the judicial expenses. The remaining expenses should be managed by the county separately. County Magistrate Li ordered the Property Department to find a way to do so under the local expenses. Chief Zhang believed that banditry was rampant in this county, and there were often 100 to 200 people detained. If all the remaining prisoner food rations were to be managed under the local expenses, it would be difficult to find a way to do so, regardless of whether the funds were exhausted. It would also be difficult to achieve fairness in terms of reason and emotion. However, since the matter concerned a provincial order, yesterday he specially inquired about the methods used by the Property Departments of Wuxi, Wujin, Changshu, Nantong, Liyang, Yixing, Rugao, and other counties for reference.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>The Judgment on the Case of Enticement between the Boss's Wife and the Apprentice Zhu Ziliang, the manager of Shenchang Company outside the South Gate of this city, previously filed a lawsuit with the county government against his wife, Wang, and the apprentice, Xue Shaotang, for enticement. It is now heard that the county government has already rendered a judgment. The judgment is as follows: It was learned that Xue Shaotang had previously served as an apprentice at Shenchang Company. Zhu Ziliang was usually on bad terms with his wife, Wang. As a result, Wang went out with Guo, a waiter at the Dingxin Inn, and fled to Xue Shaotang's house. Zhu Ziliang then filed a complaint with the government on the charge of enticement. After the government summoned witnesses for interrogation, the portion on enticement was vehemently denied not only by Zhu, Wang, and Xue Shaotang, but also by their daughter, Zhu Chunyin, who testified that her father beat her mother for buying a small amount of opium. Xue Shaotang had never been to our house in Gaoyou, nor had he talked to my mother at the inn. Furthermore, Xue Shaotang has a wife at home. If Zhu Wang and he were having an affair, why wouldn't they live separately? How dare they openly go to his house with Guo? Therefore, it is clear that Zhu Wang and Xue Shaotang's adultery is untrue. As for the portion on enticement, the criminal law does not explicitly punish women over the age of twenty. Moreover, Zhu Wang is already thirty-eight years old. Regardless of whether there was enticement or not, since there is no punitive provision in the criminal law, there is no crime to speak of. Based on the above analysis, the criminal suspicion of the defendants is insufficient and they should not be prosecuted in accordance with Article 244, Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>A Compilation of Robbery Cases (1) The Zunshu Temple in Chenye, East Township of Yin County, which housed seven nuns, was suddenly visited by five robbers last night. Speaking with a Taiwanese accent, they used large stones to break down the door and enter, robbing 44 silver dollars, 16 small silver coins, one gold ring, and five cotton quilts, causing a loss of over 200 gold. (2) At the home of Xu Abiao, a resident of Guojiafenzhuang, East Township of Yin County, five robbers suddenly arrived at 12:00 AM the night before, robbing 87 silver dollars and valuable items, causing a loss of over 100 yuan. (3) Zheng Afu, a farmer from Qinong, Fifth Township of Yin County, went to the city to buy goods the day before. While passing the pavilion near the Huacheng Nunnery in that area, he suddenly encountered three robbers. One robber slashed Afu's leg twice, causing Afu to faint and fall to the ground. Another robber immediately undressed him and searched him, robbing 25 French dollars and over 10 yuan of southern goods before fleeing. (4) At the home of Yu Zhoushi, a resident of Yang, Xiangshan, multiple robbers suddenly arrived at midnight on the 18th of this month. Each held土 guns, wooden clubs, and other items, breaking into the room and</p>
<p>looting all the clothing and other items. They also demanded silver dollars but failed and stabbed Zhoushi before leaving.</p>
<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<h3>Letter from Changshu County Government</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, We have reviewed the "National Important News" column in your newspaper on January 28th of this year, which contains a special dispatch from Jiangyin stating that a reconnaissance team discovered a土 boat with hundreds of catties of 土 in Shanquan Lake in our county. We immediately sent a letter to the Jiangyin County Government to inquire about the actual situation. We have now received a reply, which indicates that it was a matter of dumping soil in the Rongdu port within the Jiangyin boundary, which is inconsistent with the facts stated in your newspaper. We hope that you will publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the truth. Respectfully, Changshu County Government, February 19th.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Westerners' Football Match: Shanghai True Joy Great Victory</h3>
<p>▲ Seven to Three Victory over the Lancers</p>
<p>丨Returning from the Philippines, Remaining Courage is Laudable丨</p>
<p>The sound of firecrackers shook the ears, and the cheers shook the sky. This was the scene yesterday at the Shanghai Garden, where five thousand spectators welcomed the True Joy team, who had just returned from their expedition and achieved another victory over the Lancers. The True Joy athletes were also overwhelmed by the favor and ecstatic with joy. They should strive even harder, make efforts to improve, and not disappoint the ardent expectations of the people.</p>
<p>▲ Seven to Three, the Enemy Turned Downwind</p>
<p>The True Joy team returned after a long absence, full of heroic spirit. The Lancers, rested and ready, were full of energy. A great battle was inevitable. With a simple effort, True Joy scored three consecutive goals. The audience raised their eyebrows in triumph, danced and cheered. But extreme joy breeds sorrow, and prosperity turns to decline. Within five minutes, they lost two goals. The players stepped up their efforts, and the audience shouted encouragement. In the blink of an eye, they scored two more goals in quick succession. Near the end of the game, the Lancers regained a goal. In the first half, True Joy took the lead with five goals to three. In the second half, True Joy, riding the momentum of their victory, soon broke through the enemy's defenses repeatedly, scoring two more goals. As the battle closed, True Joy won with seven goals to three.</p>
<p>▲ The New Lineup's Strength is Astonishing</p>
<p>The change in True Joy after their Philippine expedition was the alteration of their lineup. In the past, Chen Zhenhe occupied a pivotal central position, responding to all directions. Now, he is listed at the forefront, charging into battle. Chen Jiaqiu was transferred back to the interior, changing from attack to defense, each in their proper place, suitable for both attack and defense. This move greatly improved the overall strength of the team. However, Xie Quanhe's goalkeeping is more than strong, but his intelligence and experience are still not as good as Liang Guanlian's. Yang Baosen is a promising newcomer, and his future is bright. As for the skills of the other warriors, the audience has long formed their own opinions, so there is no need to elaborate.</p>

<h3>War Clouds Rise, the Enemy Strikes First</h3>
<p>At three o'clock, the war clouds were thick, and the enemy struck first. The ball came from the left, crossed in front of the goal, and returned to the center from the right wing. The left inside forward shot, but the ball was weak. Goalkeeper Xie Quanhe caught it and threw it out. The ball came to the goal again, and the goalkeeper dove to the ground to save it, showing considerable skill. It then turned into a corner kick. The shot was very good, but it was headed away without success. After several waves, they were avoided one by one. As the clouds broke and the moon appeared, after hardship comes happiness. Our warriors were preparing their equipment, waiting for the opportunity to move.</p>
<p>▲ Five Tiger Generals Break Through the Enemy's Fortress Three Times</p>
<p>The Lancers' attack was ineffective, and their defense was improper. Within the penalty area, the five tiger generals of True Joy could be seen relying on their skills, colliding left and right. Fu, on the left wing, made an accurate cross. Dai Zhongge took advantage of the situation and deflected the ball diagonally. Luo Haiguang seized the opportunity and scored a goal. Yang Bao, the main kicker, took a free kick. Luo Haiguang turned his foot to the right, and Chen Zhenhe fearlessly jumped up and headed the ball into the net. Mei, on the right wing, embarked on a long expedition. Chen Zhenhe asked for a pass, and the ball came to the goal. Luo Haiguang was blessed with a rare opportunity and reaped great success. The three goals were scored within fifteen minutes, averaging one goal every five minutes.</p>
<p>▲ Striving to be First, Both Sides Work Hard Together</p>
<p>Under pressure, the enemy worked hard to counterattack. The left wing chipped the ball in, and inside right Ke Laituo took the opportunity to shoot, cutting into the goal. In the blink of an eye, right wing Mite penetrated deep into the hinterland, turned his foot and passed to the left. Left wing Aierjie met it with a kick. The goalkeeper got it but still lost it. The Lancers, in one go, scored two consecutive goals, causing the audience to feel uneasy. However, the True Joy athletes were full of courage. A little setback did not dampen their spirits. At first, they took advantage of the enemy's absence and the emptiness inside. Dai, the center forward, took the lead and attacked the goal on his own. The goalkeeper was caught off guard, rushed forward to compete, and was tricked into falling to the ground. Defender Mite quickly returned to defend, and Dai, the center forward, shot fiercely. Mite was flustered and let it into the net. Subsequently, Mei, on the right wing, kicked a corner kick, and Dai, the center forward, headed it in successfully, making the score five to two. As time was about to run out, Lancers' Ke Laituo scored a goal in a melee. In the first half, True Joy took the lead with five to three.</p>
<p>In the second half, with renewed cheers, True Joy was full of vigor and energy, and the forwards pressed on relentlessly. Yang Baosen passed the ball to the left, but Luo Haiguang, being watched, deliberately avoided it. Fu He quickened his pace, faked a shot, and angled the ball into the net. From then on, True Joy shot high and low, back and forth endlessly. Dai, the center forward, received the ball from Mei, the right wing, and casually sent it in, making it the final score of seven to three for the day. In the following thirty-five minutes, although True Joy's momentum was strong, scoring was difficult. This was because the enemy worked hard to defend in order to avoid the shame of losing ground and humiliating their team again.</p>
<h3>Shanghai International Basketball Tournament</h3>
<p>▲ Begins on March 11th</p>
<p>丨Shanghai Basketball Committee Also Has Other Resolutions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association Committee held a temporary meeting at the Deng Tuomo Hotel on Sichuan Road at 12 noon yesterday. All members attended, discussing various issues related to this year's International Basketball Tournament and League. The meeting lasted for three hours before adjourning. The records are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Because the Wu team was unable to attend on time due to office hours and traffic delays, and the game with Black Star was a past event, but because the competition rules of the association could not be easily accommodated, a letter of explanation and comfort should be sent.</p>
<p>(2) In the game between Huadong and the team on February 18, Lu Zhongen, a player of the Huadong team, deliberately threw the ball at the opponent's backboard to mock the enemy, and people in the team (non-players) went to the field to persuade the players to stop the game. Both of these matters are detrimental to sports ethics and should be warned by the committee separately.</p>
<p>(3) A. It is decided that the Shanghai International Basketball Tournament will begin on March 11th. Letters will be sent to sports organizations of various countries to invite them to join. B. Mr. Shu Hong is invited to serve as the honorary coach of the Chinese Men's Team. C. Mr. Qian Yiqin is invited to serve as the honorary coach of the Chinese Women's Team. D. Xu Zhendong, Ling Xitao, and Zhang Guodong are invited to serve on the selection committee, and together with the two coaches, they are responsible for selecting representatives of the Chinese team. E. The competition method for the International Basketball Tournament: for men, the knockout system will be used, and the final will be decided by a best-of-three match. A losers' tournament will be prepared for teams without final rights to join. For women, the competition method will be determined based on the number of registered teams.</p>

<h3>Tao Baichuan Heads Jingye Middle School</h3>
<p>▲ Teachers and Students Send Off Former Principal Niu</p>
<p>Since Principal Niu Changyao took over Shanghai Municipal Jingye Middle School, he has promoted what should be promoted and reformed what should be reformed. In less than two years, he has achieved remarkable results. The relationship between teachers and students is very good, and the feelings are harmonious, without any ill words, which is especially rare. However, Principal Niu was recently appointed by the National Government as Secretary of the Ministry of Personnel Affairs, and he cannot take care of school affairs. Therefore, the students of the school held a farewell meeting at 10 am yesterday. It was solemn and serious, which was touching. After the chairman of the Autonomous Association gave a speech, Principal Niu took the stage to give a speech, which was sincere and earnest, and he was still concerned about the future of the school, which moved all the listeners. Subsequently, Training Director Zhang Wenbo, Business Director Zhang Zishi, teacher Zhang Lianxi, student representative Li Zongmeng, and others gave speeches successively, expressing their respect for Principal Niu's school-running spirit and expressing their desire to stay. At 12 o'clock, more than 400 teachers and students took a group photo to keep the memory forever. In addition, all 70 staff members of the school held a banquet for Principal Niu and the new principal Tao Baichuan at the Tongxing Restaurant on the Fourth Road at 6 pm yesterday. It is said that Principal Tao is rich in knowledge and is scheduled to arrive at the school to take over today.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of Wumen: Old Man Who Feeds Cattle</h3>
<p>▲ Extraordinary Cold with Heavy Snow. This year, the 20th day of the 11th month of Gengwu was extraordinarily cold. According to this newspaper, it was unprecedented in more than 30 years. Recalling that in the early November of the 19th year of Guangxu (Renchen), heavy snow fell for five days and nights. The accumulated snow was more than a foot deep on the ground. Plank houses and thatched huts, both inside and outside the city, were all toppled. The cold was below zero degrees Celsius. The bottom of Taihu Lake was frozen solid. From Wan'nian Bridge at Xumen to Hengtang Yuelaixi, vehicles and horses traveled on it. Countless boats in the lake were shattered by the ice. Ice pillars hung from the eaves of people's houses, like bamboo poles from the corners of the roof to the ground. Children knocked them down to make bamboo horses to ride. Most of the poor and beggars froze to death. Coffins were sold out, and large porcelain jars were used for burial. The strangest thing was that barbershops shaved beards for people. As soon as a knife fell, the skin and beard came off together, leading to lawsuits in court. The whole city laughed about it. People who are now 60 years old can still talk about it. I was 19 years old at that time. In a blink of an eye, I am old. In the blink of an eye, I have reached the 甲戍 sixty years. Extraordinary cold has been encountered twice. The cold of Renchen lasted about half a month, while the cold of Gengwu only lasted one day.</p>
<p>▲ Tang Wenzheng Destroys the Five Saints Temple. The Five Tong Gods in the south are like the fox spirits in the north. Their tracks are erratic. Once a god comes down, it cannot be driven away. Zhijin Mountain outside Qimen in Suzhou, commonly known as Shangfang Mountain. The pagoda courtyard enshrines the Five Saints. According to legend, the Five Saints are five brothers. The residents at the foot of the mountain call them the Great Lord, Second Lord, Third Lord, Fourth Lord, and Fifth Lord. The Third Lord is the most powerful, with clear rewards and punishments. In the areas of Hengtang, Lishi, and Xinguoli around the mountain, young women in rural villages are often secretly defiled by the Five Saints. Once defiled, their families will be rewarded. The poor will become well-off immediately. If they are defiled and unwilling to submit, and they hire monks and Taoists to set up altars to worship Buddha to suppress them, they will be severely punished, either by fire or disease. Therefore, they dare to be angry but dare not speak out and listen to the ravages. Every year on the 17th and 18th nights of August, the Xingchun Bridge has flutes and drums, painted boats, thousands of lights and candles. The whole city is empty and alleys are cleared to climb the mountain to offer sacrifices. It is common practice. The official government does not prohibit it. Even if it is prohibited, there is nothing that can be done. In the early years of Kangxi, Mr. Tang Jie'an (Bin) of Suizhou was the Governor of Jiangnan.</p>
<h3>Yuzhou · 7 · 5 · Old Man</h3>
<p>I happened to read in Fang Yu Ji Yao that Yuzhou Mountain is 19 miles northeast of Haizhou, in the sea. There is a large continent surrounded by hundreds of miles, called Yuzhou, also known as Yuzhou. The Shan Hai Jing calls it Yu Mountain in the sea. In the fifth year of Jin Long'an, Sun En attacked Jiankang, but failed and fled north across the sea to Yuzhou, and so on. In the 20th century, finding land for colonization is the only policy of various countries. Yuzhou is close to the sea border. In the event of war, it is deeply worried that it will be occupied by the enemy as a place for shelter, water extraction, and colonization. This is even more important than Hong Kong and other places next to the bed. I don't know what the situation is there now. My old eyes are dim and the maps are small. I was unable to find out when I was a child, and I don't know if the naval community has paid attention to it.</p>
<h3>A Thought · Autumn · Water</h3>
<p>▲ If an old man marries a young woman, people will envy or be jealous. If an old woman marries a young man, people will mock her. Such is the inequality between men and women.</p>
<p>▲ God put vanity in the minds of men so that women could conquer, soften, and civilize them.</p>
<p>▲ A man's love is as worthless as a year-old calendar, unless you can possess all of it.</p>
<p>▲ Love is like the hair on your head and the teeth in your mouth. When you have it, it is priceless; when you lose it, it is not worth half a penny.</p>
<p>▲ Modern marriage is like a modern novel, getting shorter every day. When you stand under the wedding altar, listening to the pastor's mumbling words, you can turn to the last page and see the final result.</p>
<p>▲ Almost every woman can marry a man if the latter can manage to forget his former woman. A man who feels ashamed in this situation shows his weakness.</p>
<p>▲ A capable man issues commands at home like gentle advice. A smart woman issues commands to men like a sweet request.</p>
<p>▲ Love is a red carrot that lures stupid men, like donkeys, to abandon the free wilderness and enter a trap.</p>
<p>It is said that there are evil gods and lewd sacrifices in Suzhou. As soon as he got out of the car, he immediately led his soldiers and informed the military, civilians, and all kinds of people to go to the top of Shangfang Mountain together, burn down the temple, and throw the clay statues of the Five Saints into Taihu Lake. From then on, the women in the neighborhoods could protect their chastity, and the people of the nine counties praised him with their hands on their foreheads, saying that Ximen Bao's governance of witchcraft did not have such virtue. So they donated money to collect stones and built a memorial archway next to the Xuguan Reception Pavilion, with the four characters "The People Cannot Forget" inscribed on it. Officials passing by in boats and carriages all looked up and contemplated, and after three hundred years, the story is still told.</p>
<h3>Fragments of the Guangji Steamer Breaking the Bandits · Perilous Heart</h3>
<p>The situation of the China Merchants Bureau's Guangji steamer encountering pirates and being damaged has already been reported in the newspapers. However, Mr. Li, a passenger on the steamer when it arrived in Shanghai, told me many noteworthy details, which I am eager to recount for public viewing.</p>
<p>▲ Handsome Bandit Leader The bandit leader, Ye Mingsheng, is only twenty-six years old, with a handsome face, looking like a nobleman's son. He was wearing a dark-colored camel hair robe. When he boarded the ship, he booked cabin number nine, a first-class cabin. The crew members saw that he was carrying a large leather bag and occupying the cabin alone, and suspected that he was an important person in the party, so they treated him very well. Unexpectedly, after the ship sailed, the bandit leader went to the steerage cabin to observe the wealth of the passengers. He lingered near passengers with a lot of luggage. He also made gestures and eye contact with a dozen or so people wearing blue cloth clothes, belted at the waist, and wearing felt hats. This aroused great suspicion among the crew members. When they reported to the Chao Wu warship's water police at Huanghua Pass for investigation, the case was solved.</p>
<p>▲ Oil-Soaked Hemp Rope When the bandit leader was arrested and taken to the Chao Wu warship, he stubbornly refused to confess. The captain took a hemp rope soaked in tung oil and whipped him hard. First, he asked if the Xin Ning Tai steamer had been robbed by him. At this point, the bandit could not bear the pain and had to confess the truth.</p>
<p>▲ Robbery Plan The bandit confessed the details of the robbery, saying that he was from Haimen and was publicly elected by the Tai bandits as the leader for handling affairs abroad (i.e., the robbery boss). The Xin Ning Tai steamer was also robbed by the Tai bandits, but he was not in command. This time, they planned to rob the Guangji. The bandits considered it many times and designated 140 people to handle the case. Twenty people boarded the ship, and 120 people were sent to drive six bandit ships to wait on the sea surface 100 miles outside Huanghua Pass, preparing to move the stolen goods. He had an agency in Wenzhou. This time he boarded the ship to rob 300,000 yuan. If the ship did not have enough money, they would rob the Guangji steamer and order the China Merchants Bureau to redeem it for 300,000 yuan, because the Guangji had a shallow draft and a small hull, so it could be robbed into various straits.</p>
<p>▲ Fortunes of Each Ship The bandit leader, Ye Mingsheng, also said that the gang planned to rob merchant ships, starting with the Guangji steamer. After that, they decided to rob the Xin Bao Shan Da Xing Yi Li Zhou Shan and Chuan Shan six ships on the Shanghai-Taiwan line one by one. They planned to rob seven ships within two months. Now that he had been arrested, the plan to rob the ships had been broken. It was fortunate for the various shipping bureaus, especially the China Merchants Bureau. He also said that there were six or seven hundred bandits in the same party, scattered on the coastal islands, with agencies in Shanghai and Wenzhou.</p>
<p>▲ Easy Robbery and Escort to Wenzhou There is a bandit agency in the East Gate of Wenzhou, and the bandit leader was also captured. However, Ye had been severely tortured and his legs were broken, so he could not move. So they changed to the third bandit leader to Ou. A base was uncovered in the East Gate, and the four bandits who stayed in Wenzhou had already fled, and only one wooden-cased gun was found. Now the bandits have been escorted back to the Chao Wu warship, and the captain is investigating the location of their bandit dens in order to send a large team of military police to suppress them and rescue the kidnapped passengers of the Xin Ning Tai steamer.</p>
<h3>Trivial Talks on Westerners Studying Chinese Literature · Laughing Shanghai</h3>
<p>The other night, I happened to talk to my elders about Westerners studying Chinese literature, which was quite interesting. But we Chinese seem to feel ashamed of it.</p>
<p>During the late Qing Dynasty, there was an American named Ding Huizhen who was extremely fond of studying Chinese literature. He was familiar with all the classics, histories, philosophies, and collections. During the Guangxu period, he was even selected as a Hanlin scholar in our country, which was also considered strange. Ding once had a couplet, soliciting responses from our Chinese people. The couplet was "One three birds harm people: crows, pigeons, sparrows." The meaning was the opium in our country, the black curtain of releasing white pigeons in society, and the mahjong tiles (three things), the content contains eating, prostituting, gambling three things. ) The content includes eating, whoring, and gambling, which are very harmful to people. When the Chinese people saw that his first line had been written, they searched their brains and conceived a second line. Before long, one person came up with it and wrote to Ding. The second line was "Four things eliminate you: scales, phoenixes, dragons." Ding read it and was furious, because there was an ancient saying in our country: "Scales, phoenixes, dragons, turtles." This was probably satirizing Ding as a turtle. Ding then came up with another couplet, cursing the Chinese people, saying, "Sparrow top, horseshoe sleeves, dressed as animals." The meaning was scolding the Qing people's clothing. But until now, no one has been able to come up with a matching line. (Note: This Ding Huizhen was the one who drafted the treaty during the Eight-Nation Alliance.)</p>
<p>When the Shanghai International Settlement Mixed Court had not been taken back, a foreign assessor in the court was well-versed in the Four Books. During the May 30th Massacre, several university students went to see the foreigner. The foreigner questioned them with the teachings of Confucius. The university students all stared blankly and could not answer. After a long time, they finally said, "The books believed by the Confucian scholars are not applicable to the present era." The foreigner smiled and said, "Don't say it's not applicable. This kind of doctrine is immortal. I hope you will read it carefully." The university students all retreated in shame.</p>
<h3>Tragic News of the Zhejiang Epidemic · Shi Yan Ye</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, the epidemic in Zhejiang has been rampant. Unfortunately, thousands of people have died of meningitis. It is truly a great disaster for the people of Zhejiang in the past twenty years. A friend from Zhejiang came to Shanghai and told me two very tragic stories from the epidemic. I wrote them down to share in this discussion.</p>
<p>▲ Groom Dies of Epidemic, Bride Becomes a Nun In the village of Zhuji, a relative of my friend, surnamed Tian, married a woman surnamed Song ten days after New Year's Day. Guests and friends gathered, and joy overflowed the courtyard. The newlyweds were originally united to fight against the harsh environment, so they felt even more proud and ambitious on this day. Unexpectedly, joy was just beginning, and tragedy followed. Soon after the auspicious day, the groom suddenly contracted the epidemic. In the remote rural area, medicine was hard to come by in times of need. The local doctors who were called in were all outsiders to this disease and could not prescribe the right medicine. Sadly, before the day was over, the groom abandoned his lover and left. The groom's two old parents wept bitterly for their beloved son, needless to say. The bride was even more distraught and wanted to die. When her husband's coffin was placed in the hall, she repeatedly wanted to jump in and become a pair of mandarin ducks in the afterlife, but she was prevented by many people. After the incident, she took poison, but was discovered by someone. Five days later, she took the opportunity to go to Hangzhou and had her head shaved in a temple. When her family on both sides found her, they cried and begged her to return, but she refused. She said that if she returned, she would vow to die. Staying here would still give her hope of seeing them again. She begged them not to go against her will to live a stolen life. Seeing that her will could not be taken away, they agreed. From then on, a thin-fated beauty was added between the Six Bridges and the Three Tianzhu Temples, spending her days listening to the morning bell and evening drum. Alas.</p>
<p>▲ Beloved Son Dies Tragically, Father Follows In a town near Hangzhou, an old man surnamed Huang had a son at the age of sixty. His family fortune was in the hundreds of thousands. The old man was satisfied that his great wealth would have a son to inherit it. But Heaven was not kind and brought misfortune to this five-year-old son. The lively and innocent child died of illness in less than three hours. Even great wealth could not redeem the life of the child. The old man lost this treasure and felt hopeless about the future. His old and frail body grieved several times and then he lay in bed. His broken heart could not be saved by medicine. Eight days after his beloved son died tragically, the old father followed him and left. It was also tragic.</p>
<p>Correction Yesterday, the title of "Tobacco Talk Snippets" was mistakenly printed as "Tobacco Humorous Snippets". This is to correct it.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (372) · Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 17: Skillful in Maintaining Youth, Emerald Eyebrows Blended; No Way to Extend Life, the Golden Market Covets Fine Horses</p>
<p>From then on, Hua Yuanchun stuffed that white gold watch into the corner of the drawer. There was originally a box for it, but now that box had actually become "returning the case while buying the pearl", and was thrown somewhere. One day, while looking for something else, she rummaged through the drawer. She didn't find what she was looking for, but she saw the white gold watch again. She saw that the small diamonds around it were filled with a lot of dust, and the white color was also dim. Hua Yuanchun couldn't help but think of the young man from Nanyang who gave her the watch. He was so generous and extravagant. She wondered when he would come to Shanghai again. She quickly used a small toothbrush to carefully brush away the dust from the diamonds. She also wiped the surface of the white gold. She found another box and put it in, placing it in the jewelry box. After all, that white gold watch had been gathering dust outside all this time, but now it was welcomed back to the palace. Now Hua Lao Liu thought of that white gold watch again, thinking that it was worth five hundred yuan. Even if she discounted it by 80%, she could pawn it for one hundred yuan. If she added some other things, it would be almost enough. So she solemnly took it out of the jewelry box. Because her partner was clumsy, she entrusted A Jinjie in the room to do it. She also told her that this was white gold, which was several times more expensive and better than gold. Don't let the pawnshop think it's silver. This was given to me by a former lover. He spent five or six thousand yuan on me, and only gave me this watch as a souvenir. Once I have money, I will redeem it. A Jinjie happily took the watch to the pawnshop. It was transferred from the hands of the appraiser in the third counter to the appraiser in the second counter, and then from the hands of the appraiser in the second counter to the appraiser in the first counter. The appraiser in the first counter took off his old-fashioned copper-rimmed glasses, looked at it again and again, and then used a small microscope, closed one eye and looked at it for a long time. Then he opened the watch and listened to it next to his ear for a long time before saying that it could be pawned for thirty yuan at most. A Jin said, "This is white gold, several times more expensive and better than gold. Don't be stupid. Look carefully. How can you say that it can only be pawned for thirty yuan? That circle of small diamonds is worth more than thirty yuan." The appraiser in the second counter couldn't tell if the watch was copper, steel, or silver. Now that he heard A Jin say that it was white gold, he carefully looked at the watch again. Because he had never appreciated white gold before. He thought that white gold was nothing special, and it was almost the same as silver. The appraiser in the first counter was already old. He was already furious when he heard A Jin scolding him for being stupid. His beard was standing on end in anger. He sneered and said, "We only know that gold is yellow. We don't know that gold is white. What white gold? We say we don't know. That's what the foreigners use to deceive Chinese children."</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Standard Suddenly Turns Downstream</h3>
<p>▲ A Terrible Drop of Twenty-Four Taels and Three Mace</p>
<p>▲ Difference of Nearly Thirty Taels Yesterday, the gold standard suddenly turned to a low point on February 21st, once breaking the 760 tael mark. However, it tended to rise in the morning, and then returned to a state of fatigue. The waves roared, and the changes were extremely drastic. From morning to noon, the difference of nearly thirty taels was finally a terrible drop of twenty-four or five taels. It was an extremely large grind, which is unbelievable. Transactions among the industry were still prosperous, but the sources of payment such as Yuansheng, Wanxing, and remittance hedging were all buying in. Hengxing, Zhifengyong, Qianyu, Xiang and others were mostly selling out. Also, large households such as Fuchang, Hengxingyuan, and Yuantai were entering and exiting from time to time. The divergent trends of express and implied remittance rates, the listed price shrunk by half a gear, and the domestic market was wronged by the tightness. The overseas silver market has reported low again, and the gold price clearly shows a high image. In the future, the selling party will continue to surge, especially as the atmosphere is bad. The news of the Sino-American loan is turbulent, the environment is not good, the sudden storm is almost a case of the river flowing downwards, the sharp drop of more than twenty taels, only the state is hesitant, and the maneuver of four or five taels is unpredictable and difficult to handle. Finally, the price suddenly fell to within sixty taels. The market closed as usual on Saturday afternoon. Looking back from this week, there were only four days of market conditions, but the changes were not small. A new record of 799 taels was once discovered. Until yesterday afternoon, the low point of 59 taels and 5 mace was seen again, a difference of nearly forty taels. A total drop of twenty-one or two taels was recorded. This morning, the bulk gold is expected to rise.</p>
<p>▲ Morning Initially Opened High The April opening in the early morning was 788 taels and a half, an increase of 4 taels and 7 mace, because the bulk gold fell back by a quarter, the silver price fell by three-quarters, and the private telegram was reduced by 6875. Subsequently, because Zhifengyong, Qianchangxiang, etc. tended to sell out, the remittance rate also turned loose. Banks bought April British gold at 120625 to 12125, so it suddenly turned downward and fell by more than ten taels. However, there were occasional maneuvers of three or four taels. Until 9:30, it was only 77 taels and a half. The British gold listing was reduced by 125, the US dollar by 25, and the Japanese gold was increased by 1.75 points, so it increased to 81 taels.</p>
<p>▲ News Is Turbulent and Undecided Not long after, it was still softening. The news was not good. There were rumors that the United States still had a plan to relieve the silver shortage, and the case of the US loan to China was turbulent and undecided. People were flustered, and the selling pressure from Yuanmaoyong, Yuanfengyong, Fuchang, Hengxing, Qianchangxiang, etc. was strong, and a sudden storm arose, with a terrible drop of more than ten taels. At 10 o'clock, it was 64 taels and a half. However, there were four or five taels of rise and fall in half an hour. The British gold was particularly loose, and the recent price was 123125 in and out. It took seven or eight minutes to do, plus four taels. Therefore, Fuyu, Hengyu, etc. bought in, and after 68 taels were reported, Hengxing, Changshengyong, etc. came on stage to sell, with a sharp drop of more than eight taels. At 10:20, it was 60 taels. Then Yu Da, Yuancheng, Shunli, and Wanxing all entered. Mackie &amp; Co. ate in April British gold at 1225, Mitsui bought US dollars at 28.825, and then turned upward. At 11 o'clock, it was 67 taels and a half. Subsequently, the quotations of each number were different, and Yuantai, Fuyi, and Futaiheng occasionally bought and sold, resulting in four taels of rise and fall.</p>
<p>▲ Breaking the Sixty Taels Mark After 11:30, the trend was extremely weak. Dadecheng, Hongli, Hengxingyuan, etc. all had sales, so the price fell sharply by seven or eight taels. However, the maneuver of two or three taels in an instant was considered strange. By the time the market closed at noon, it was 759 taels and a half, a decrease of 24 taels and 3 mace compared to the day before. After the market closed, it was reduced by two taels and a half to 57 or 8 taels, and the goods were pressed down by 1.5 taels. The maximum price in half a day was 88 taels and a half, and the minimum price was 59 taels and a half, with a difference of 29 taels. The goods market was 87 taels and 8 mace in the morning and 58 taels at noon. The asking price has been changed to 856 taels and 2 mace, a reduction of 75 taels. The noon closing was 96 or 7 taels, and the registration was 250 taels in February, 53 taels in March, and 60 taels in April, with a replenishment of 50 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Uneven Entry and Exit in the Industry In terms of transactions, Zhifengyong, Yuanchun, Qianchangxiang, Hongli, Shunli, Hengxing, etc. all had sales. Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Futaiheng, Yu Da, Yuantai, Hengyu, etc. had uneven entry and exit. Wanxing, Yuantaiyong, and Changshengyong all entered. Hengxingyuan, Fuchangfuyu, and other goods entered and exited from time to time. The Dali gang sold more than 1,000 bars, and entered 1,200 to 1,300 bars. The Guangzhou gang also sold more than 1,000 bars.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Is Unstable and Impermanent</h3>
<p>▲ Listed Price Shrinks ···Domestic Market Is Very Loose</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets both fell back, and the exchange rate also fell. However, the trend in the European market was erratic, or it recovered and rose again, probably because the United States was maintaining its strength. As for the Shanghai market, the HSBC listed price has shrunk by half a gear. The British gold is 125, and it is now 1 shilling and 1.75 pence. The US dollar is 25, and it is 27 yuan and 75 cents. The Indian exchange rate is 75, and it is 77 rupees and 25 cents. The French franc is 6 yuan, and it is 710 yuan. The German exchange rate is 1 yuan, and it is 117 marks. The Japanese dollar is 75, and it is 60 shields and 15 cents. Hong Kong is still 78 taels and a half, Singapore plus 2 taels, and it is 202 taels. The Japanese gold plus 1.75 points, and it is 1 tael, 7 mace, 7 cents, and 75 mils. However, the domestic market of banks was initially firm and then tired. It was indeed a very different situation, which was the opposite of the previous day. The volatility of the market is very difficult to understand. The gold market was indeed stormy, and the fluctuation reached several taels in half a day. In the end, it fell sharply by 24 taels and a few mils, causing the exchange rate to collapse. The stimulus of the dangerous atmosphere, until the market closed at noon, compared with the previous day, the British gold morning was 3125, the US dollar was long 625, and the Japanese yuan fell by 3.5 points. People were panicked, and merchants such as Fuchang, Qianchangxiang, and Fushun all sold British gold to hedge their positions, with a transaction of more than 100,000 pounds. Banks such as Yijing, HSBC, Zhengjin, Mackie, and North Korea all absorbed it, and the Chinese and Japanese banks did a little bit of mutual trading. A few of the US dollar gold industry sold it off, but the Japanese currency was not dealt with due to hedging failure, so there was no transaction.

<h3>Overseas Silver Prices Fall Back Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to the London telegram, the price of bulk silver did fall back again, with the recent price shrinking by 25 to 12 pence and 1875 mils (equivalent to 1 shilling, 2 pence and 375 mils for British gold), and the forward price also shrinking by 25 to 12 pence and 10625 mils. Local Chinese sold and speculators bought in, and the market was unsettled. The market was calm after the close. The United States continued to buy in. According to the New York telegram, the price of American silver also shrank by 75 to 26 cents and 25 mils. The British pound fell by 0.0625 against the US dollar to 4 yuan, 8 dimes, 5 cents, and 32/19 mils.

<h3>Foreign Cents and Subsidiary Coins Show Slight Changes</h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview Yesterday, the coin market still only had one morning market transaction, and it was closed in the afternoon, so the market atmosphere was quiet and more permanent. The cent market rose slightly, and the corner dollars in the subsidiary coins showed up and down, which was to balance the two stable corner dollar markets. The copper coins shrunk again, probably because the long position was too strong the day before and was affected by the backlash.</p>
<p>▲ Cents Lending Situation Is Still Stable (Foreign Cents) Because there were few buyers and sellers and the market was quiet, the banks wanted to purchase large batches of linings, but no one supplied them, so the cent price increased by 7.5 mils to 7 yuan, 2 dimes and 3 mils (silver discount). It was still lent in white, and there was no addition of mercury root for the lining, so the use was still rare. There were few discount tickets, so they only decorated the market and had no formal opportunity. It is expected that there will be no silver discount market price in the next half month.</p>
<p>▲ Jiangsu Rises, Guangdong Falls, Copper Coins Suddenly Shrink The small foreign coins in Jiangnan could not hold their ground due to the chaotic market in the previous days, so the result was that they were even more than a few mils or even 1 point more than the small French coins in Guangdong. Now the market is gradually returning to normal, so it is rising step by step to balance the market. Yesterday morning, it was 6 yuan, 9 dimes and 5 mils, an increase of 1 point and 6 mils compared to the previous day. 1,500 corners were traded in the early market. The small foreign coins in Guangdong fell back by 2.5 mils to 6 yuan, 6 dimes and 1 mil. 160,000 corners were traded. The copper coins suddenly shrunk by 8,000 coins to 371,000 coins. The entry and exit of silver dollars were still quiet. (Silver 款) Yesterday, the banks' receipts and transfers were generally sparse. Because the business was closed in the afternoon, there was no way to check in detail. It was only heard that the total amount of receipts and transfers from Chinese merchants was more than 2 million, and from foreign merchants was more than 1 million. The receipts and transfers from Japanese merchants were also only more than 1 million. The receipts and transfers from coin shops and silver guilds alone were more than 12 million, and the receipts and transfers of the lining 款 were more than 1.6 million. (洋款) The exchange of remittance tickets in the early market was 610,000, and there was no market in the noon market. The banknotes were also only 10,000 in the early market. The off-market banknotes were 125,000, and the banks bought and sold more than 200,000. The foreign accounts of the banks only amounted to more than 100,000, the payment orders were 60,000 to 70,000, the receipts and transfers from coin shops and foreign public offices were more than 1.7 million and 800,000, and the transactions of small coin shops were more than 300,000.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Prices Become Increasingly Firm and Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Shanghai securities market, the public bond market condition saw sparse spot trading, with only 6,500 yuan changing hands. The futures market, however, was firm and strong, with trading suddenly becoming lively and bustling. Market buying and selling were unusually active, with transactions between the two sessions reaching over 7.1 million yuan. Quite a few bonds were sold at high prices in the market, and demand was also very strong. As a result, bond prices became increasingly firm and strong. However, the supply and demand situation did not change significantly. The price fluctuated only by a few jiao between the two sessions, increasing by only about two jiao compared to the previous day.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Trend Slightly Calmer</h3>
<p>▲ Procedures for Supplementing Margin Deposits are Extremely Busy</p>
<p>▲ Market Opening Delayed Until 4:30 PM</p>
<p>The yarn market trend remains firm. Because most sellers found it difficult to maintain their positions, prices rose sharply. The collection of margin deposits was also delayed. Because the special and supplementary margin deposits had not been fully collected in the morning session, the market opening was delayed until 4:30 PM. The yarn market opened with overseas cotton yarn market conditions trending downward, and sentiment was slightly weary. The situation was relatively calm. However, the bullish attitude was unusually firm. Spot yarn sales in the market gradually became active. How the future will unfold is difficult to predict. The opening price of the standard yarn fell by six or seven qian, but rebounded in the second and third sessions. As a result, the prices of all yarns rose by three, four, five, and seven qian respectively. The total volume of transactions was 10,350 bales, with most of the purchases being made by short sellers. As for the situation on the previous day, when both sides held their positions until 8:30 PM, the authorities in Shanghai searched for several thousand bales of spot yarn in various factories and sold them for delivery. Therefore, the market situation yesterday felt slightly suppressed. It is reported that the total volume of transactions on the previous day was 25,650 bales. According to some sources, standard Japanese yarn will no longer be added because its scope is too small and prone to disputes. There are deep concerns that standards may be redefined. The closing prices for standard yarn are recorded below:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, Account Balance</p>
<p>May 18.00 Up 4 56,000</p>
<p>February 17.63 Up 5 19,250 June 17.97 Up 3 32,900</p>
<p>March 17.7 Up 7 56,450 July 17.9 Up 3 10,500</p>
<p>April 17.85 Up 1 43,250</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are gradually picking up, with merchants from Tianjin being the most active. This is due to the strike at the yarn factories in that area. Statistics show that a total of 1,575 bales were purchased by various merchants throughout the day, and the market sentiment was slightly firm. Among the merchants, Tianjin purchased 975 bales, Shantou purchased 100 bales, Changsha purchased 175 bales, inland areas purchased 110 bales, Guangzhou and Beijing purchased 100 bales, Xuzhou purchased 70 bales, Qinhuangdao purchased 50 bales, miscellaneous merchants purchased 95 bales, and commission agents purchased 615 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Slightly Calmer</h3>
<p>▲ Recent Continuous Rise of Four Qian</p>
<p>The cotton market is slightly calmer, and the trend is more moderate. Because gold prices have fallen back and American cotton has weakened, market sentiment has softened slightly. It is reported that on the previous day, several large long position holders in East China Cotton Exchange liquidated 60,000 to 70,000 dan, and many short sellers were forced to cover their positions. Therefore, the market situation is temporarily calm. The future direction will still depend on exchange rates and Indian cotton. On the previous day (the 20th), closing prices for cotton futures reached 45 taels at 8:30 PM. Japanese merchants liquidated 60,000 to 70,000 dan in large quantities. The authorities in Shanghai maintained purchases of spot goods, and sales also amounted to a considerable 30,000 to 40,000 dan. Yesterday, at 4:30 PM, the market opened with a slightly weaker sentiment, with prices falling by two or three qian. In the second and third sessions, retail investors covered their short positions and prices rose again by two hundred dan. The total volume of transactions on the previous day was 126,600 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, Account Balance May 45.15 Up 15 85,600 February 45.40 Up 40 34,100 June 45.15 Up 15 64,600</p>

<p>April 45.15 Up 15 72,000</p>
<p>Although spot cotton trading is limited, holders of goods remain confident.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 47.10 Pu Yi Factory purchased 300 pieces Sent to the factory</p>
<p>Also 46.25 to 46.50 East China Cotton Exchange purchased 800 pieces Delivered to the warehouse</p>
<h3>Global Cotton Yarn Unanimously Weakens</h3>
<p>▲ American Cotton Continues to Fall by 20 Points</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton weakened due to a lack of major buyers, poor news from Liverpool, and reactive selling. Futures fell by 18 to 22 points, spot goods fell by 20 points. British cotton futures fell by 7-8 points, and spot goods fell by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 15 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded below (dated the 20th):</p>

<h3>American Cotton Gradually Shows Signs of Turning Around</h3>
<p>▲ Cotton Cloth Market Conditions Are Quite Good</p>
<p>A New York telegram on the 20th reported on the cotton market situation for the week, stating: "The news from India is encouraging, Lancashire textile factories have also decided to resume work, and domestic demand for cotton cloth has increased. Due to these factors, industry players are buying, and short position holders are covering their positions. Agency firms also have some demand, and brokers are also buying, mostly on behalf of Japanese clients. Demand from Liverpool and Europe is still strong. According to news from Liverpool, Mumbai almost daily purchases raw cotton in Liverpool. When the October contract rises to 1.2 cents, demand gradually decreases, and reactive sentiment arises. The reasons for this are partly that the actual position is easier to loosen, and partly that high prices lead to concerns about excessive cotton planting. However, buy orders during price drops are often absorbed by industry players. Rainfall in the South has delayed cotton harvesting work in several areas, but new cotton crops are reportedly progressing well. According to several sources, since 1925, the planting work at this time of year has never been as extensive as it is this year."</p>
<p>Another report states: "Cotton market sentiment is stable, and European purchases are the highest. The general picture is that of short position holders covering positions and industry players settling prices. Spot demand is still good, and base prices are slightly firm. More textiles are being traded. Recent months have been slightly softer because the reduction in cotton acreage is not as large as expected. Bullish sentiment has eased."</p>
<p>Another report states: "The liquidation of long positions at the end of last year and the slight drop in market prices led to a very unsatisfactory situation in the cotton cloth market. However, conditions gradually improved in January, prices became firmer, and sales were also more extensive, especially for goods that had undergone finishing processes. Sales in the first six weeks of this year reportedly exceeded production by 20%. Cloth prices loosened in early February, while cotton prices rose, causing considerable concern for manufacturers, as sales have recently decreased slightly. However, it was not long before buyers increased, competing to place orders, and cloth prices are now firmer. Although sales are currently good and inventories are low, there is no profit to be made at current prices. Cloth prices have an upward trend, but there are fears that sales will increase. Some factories may abandon their plans to continue reducing production in March. 70% of factories will abolish night work for female and child laborers starting March 1. If another 5% of the cotton industry supports this move, then night work for women and children can be abolished at that time. It is thought that this matter can be achieved. The weekend statistics are attached below (unit: thousand bales):</p>

<h3>Grains: White Japonica Rice Rises Sharply by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday, more than 30 firms arrived to source goods. There are approximately 50 firms in total at Hexia. Market sales are not very active, and few shopkeepers are purchasing goods from the market. However, market sentiment is perky. White Japonica rice from Northern merchants has risen sharply by half a yuan, with top-grade Japonica opening at 13.4 yuan. However, special Japonica rice requires 13.8 yuan, but such goods are extremely scarce in the market. Slightly thinner sales, the market is not lively, and prices are two or three jiao higher, with high-quality rice opening at 11.7 yuan. The supply of Yang Xian rice is low and the quality is very good, with prices rising by four or five jiao. Du Xian rice from Buding and Jianshan are also good, both up by three jiao. The prices of all grades above have mostly been called up since the close of accounts. Ordinary Yuan rice sales are mediocre, and purchases are extremely sluggish, so the market is showing no signs of improvement. High-quality goods opened at 12.6 yuan. Total transactions were not active throughout the day, totaling just over 1,000 dan.</p>
<p>▲ South Shanghai: Yesterday, approximately 40 firms arrived to source goods. Sales on this street are exceptionally brisk. Machine-milled rice from Changshu, Wuxi, Suzhou, Tongzhou, and other regions is lively and prices are up by five or six jiao, with the situation being extremely perky. Early rice from Southern merchants is said to have arrived to source goods. Requisitioning personnel are also enthusiastic, so prices on the wholesale market have risen by three jiao. Top-grade rice is 11.2 yuan. Yang Xian and Du Xian rice are scarce in the local market and not cost-effective in the production and sales markets. Future supplies are bound to be scarce, so prices have risen by as much as six jiao. Tongbian Yin Yuan rice arrivals and sales are both sluggish, but prices are slightly firm, and the market situation is ordinary.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Rise Step by Step</h3>
<p>▲ Market Sentiment is Unusually High</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market saw price increases in all contract months in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Recent prices for foreign wheat are no longer as low as they were before the market closure. Generally, short sellers lack the ability to continue trading. The price of foreign wheat, referring only to Australian wheat, must be around six qian. As for Chicago and Canadian wheat, there are no comparative prices. Looking at the distant months, the heavy spring snow may affect future harvests. Compared to previous years, prices are still at reasonable levels. Therefore, market sentiment among both industry insiders and outsiders is uniformly high. Buyers are numerous, while sellers are scarce. It is also heard that speculative long position holders in the yarn and cloth industry are buying without regard to price, causing the market to rise higher and higher. As a result, the current month contract rose by 1 qian and 6 fen compared to before the market closure, the March contract rose by 1 qian and 5 fen, the April and May contracts rose by 1 qian and 4 fen, the June contract rose by 2 qian and 2 fen, and the July contract rose by 2 qian and 3 fen. Because of the market confusion, there are no spot wheat transactions.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Rises Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>▲ Numerous Outsiders are Continuously Absorbing</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a frenzied state in all contract months after the morning opening. After a ten-day closure, the foreign exchange market remained tight, and the price of foreign wheat was shouting higher and higher due to exchange rate factors. Before the closure, Australian wheat had called for 3 taels 9 qian and 5-6 fen. After the closure, it shouted up to about 4 taels and 6 qian. In a blink of an eye, there seemed to be a difference of 6 qian and 5 fen. In addition, the factory's spot flour initially opened at 2 qian and 5 fen, then shouted up to 3 qian. With these factors accumulating, the market's frenzied rise had become impossible to suppress. In addition, outsiders and some Yingkou merchants were absorbing along with the market, making the market even more agitated. At its highest, the near-term contracts reached five or six fen, and the distant-term contracts reached qian Xu. Subsequently, the factory continued and the distant-term contracts fell back by two or three fen. Until the beginning of the afternoon opening, sentiment softened because the gold price reported a decline. Finally, the market turned higher again due to the continuous absorption of outsiders. As a final result, the current month contract rose by 6 fen and 2.5 li compared to before the closure, the March contract rose by 5 fen and 7.5 li, the April and May contracts rose by 6 fen and 7.5 li, the June contract rose by 7 fen and 7.5 li, and the July contract rose by 8 fen and 7.5 li.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits and Seafood: Transactions at the Opening are Not Smooth</h3>
<p>Dried fruits and seafood have been quite quiet during the major market closure period. Yesterday was the first day of trading. Longan prices have already increased, and dried lychees remain firm. Glutinous rice opened at 88 taels, and ordinary flat branches opened at 44 taels. Among the Northern goods, the selling price of Huicai is higher, while the rest are similar to before. In fact, various merchant groups are still handling scattered transactions. Large-scale purchasing has not yet started, so there are no excessive increases. However, the foundation is quite firm. If sales turn brisk, the market trend will inevitably rise.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Prices of Both Chinese and Foreign Goods Rise by One Fen</h3>
<p>▲ The Rise is Too Severe Transactions are Conversely Dull</p>
<p>▲ Merchant Groups are Slightly Accommodating</p>
<p>The piece goods market reopened yesterday, but because the rise was too sharp, transactions were not as prosperous as in previous years. Only three or four hundred pieces were sold yesterday, and merchant groups were also slightly accommodating. Prices have risen by about one fen compared to before the total closure.

<p>▲ To be Set Up at the Original Site of the Labor Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal National Assembly Representative Election is being actively prepared by Mayor Zhang Qun. Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office to discuss borrowing surplus rooms in the Foreign Affairs Building to serve as the Shanghai Municipal National Assembly Representative Election Provisional Office.

<h3>Illiterate Citizens</h3>
<p>▲ Also Have the Right to Vote in the National Assembly</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs yesterday, stating: "To issue an order for implementation, according to the Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee's letter, which states: 'Regarding the issue of the right to vote for illiterate representatives in people's organizations, we previously sent personnel to consult with the Central Training Department. The explanation given at that time was that for illiterate representatives, the chairman of the assembly could designate personnel to fill out the ballot on their behalf, based on the representative's opinions. Their right to vote and be elected cannot be deprived simply because they are not good at writing. Given the current situation in our country, more than 80% of the population is illiterate. During this period of political tutelage, implementing civil rights training, the majority of the illiterate population should not be excluded from the scope of training, nor should they be denied the rights they are entitled to within the assembly simply because they are illiterate. Our committee's former Training Department has already instructed the organization instructors of people's organizations in various districts accordingly. We hereby send a letter for your reference and request that you inform your subordinates accordingly.'" In response to this, in addition to forwarding the letter, we hereby order the County Magistrate to inform your subordinates accordingly. This order.</p>

<h3>Shigemitsu Aoi Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>▲ Sino-Japanese Telecommunications Negotiations are Coming to an End</p>
<p>▲ The Ning Case and Han Case Can Also Be Resolved Soon</p>
<p>Japanese Acting Minister Shigemitsu Aoi, accompanied by Secretaries Wanouchi and Hayashi, and the Japanese telecommunications negotiation committee members Yoshino, Iino, Nomura, and others, returned to Shanghai from Beijing by night express train at 7:00 AM yesterday morning. Yesterday, Shigemitsu, when hosting reporters, gave a speech, saying, "The result of this round of negotiations in Beijing for Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations has reached the final stage. The Qingdao-Sasebo line contract has been passed by the Japanese Privy Council, so I can formally sign it when I go to Beijing next week. As for the detailed business agreements for the Shanghai-Nagasaki line, the wording is currently being revised, and it has largely been completed. Regarding the Ning case and the Han case, I also had detailed discussions with Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting in Beijing this time. In fact, it can be said that they have been resolved. The only difference is that the resolution is merely formal. The external rumors that the Ning case compensation is 750,000 yuan and the Han case is 300,000 yuan are mostly speculation and not worthy of deep belief. This is because the time for disclosure has not yet arrived. The payment method for the compensation, whether it is paid in one lump sum or in installments, is still under discussion. I am scheduled to go to Beijing next Tuesday (the 24th) for a final consultation."</p>

<h3>Misinformation Regarding a Large Sum of Stolen Money from the Bank of Communications</h3>
<p>▲ Actual Loss: $920</p>
<p>▲ Reimbursed by the Guarantor</p>
<p>Rumors circulated in this city that the Bank of Communications had a large sum of money stolen, with some saying $2.5 million and others claiming even more. For a time, the whole city was in an uproar, regarding it as a major theft. Considering the gravity of the situation, this newspaper investigated from all sides yesterday and learned that the facts were a misunderstanding. It turns out that the bank usually adopts a rotational method for checking banknotes. After person A counts them, they are handed over to person B, and after person B counts them, they are handed over to person C. Since they are checked in rotation, there have never been any mistakes. This time, a certain junior employee privately took $920 in banknotes while counting them and secreted them out. When the counting was finished, there was a shortage of banknotes. The superior bank staff, for the sake of caution, went to the vault to recount them. At that time, the cashier was out on official business due to receiving money, as it was still early for the vault check. When the vault checkers arrived and saw that the cashier was absent, they became very suspicious, thinking that if the cashier was involved in embezzlement, the amount lost would be more than just this small sum. All sorts of misunderstandings thus arose. However, the cashier had been working for many years and was honest and reliable. Just as they were in doubt, the cashier returned, explaining the reason for the absence, and the suspicions were cleared. The junior employee had not returned to the bank for a long time, so the truth became clear, and the guarantor was held accountable. The guarantor then reimbursed the full amount, and the matter was put to rest.</p>

<h3>Extension of the Unified Tax Deadline for Cotton Yarn Inventory</h3>
<p>▲ The Unified Tax Bureau Telegraphed Branch Chiefs to Extend the Deadline to the End of March</p>
<p>After the implementation of the unified tax on cotton yarn ex-factory from February 1st, for the inventory before February 1st, a pass would be issued after reporting to the Unified Tax Bureau and having personnel verify it, with a deadline of clearing the inventory by the 16th. The Chinese Cotton Mill Association thought that the time was too tight, and in fact, it was impossible to clear the inventory within the deadline. The association then requested the Unified Tax Bureau to extend the deadline. It has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to extend the deadline to the end of March, as reported previously. It is now learned that the Unified Tax Bureau telegraphed the various regional bureaus the day before yesterday to comply with the order. The telegram stated, "The procedures for collecting tax on cotton yarn ex-factory have been discussed and six temporary and simplified methods have been agreed upon with the Chinese Cotton Mill Association and the general representatives of manufacturers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and have been telegraphed to you for compliance on Yu Day. Regarding the matter of exempting the inventory before February 1st from the unified tax and continuing to transport and sell as before, the original deadline was February 16th for clearing all inventory, and taxes would be collected according to regulations after the deadline. Now, the association has petitioned for an extension, and the Ministry has issued an order stating that the first half of February coincided with the Lunar New Year holiday, and transportation was suspended, which is somewhat difficult in commercial customs, and it is considered realistic after reviewing. The transport and sale of inventory is tentatively allowed to be extended until March 31st, and there will be no further extensions after this. This should be complied with. In addition to replying to the Yarn Merchants Association in writing and sending separate telegrams, it is hereby telegraphed for compliance. Director Xie Huixing."</p>
<h3>A Comparison of the Advantages and Disadvantages for Chinese and Japanese Yarn Merchants After the Implementation of the Unified Cotton Yarn Tax</h3>
<p>▲ Chinese Merchants are Being Over-Taxed</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the cotton yarn tax was originally collected by the customs in four grades. This time, it has been changed to a unified tax, and the Ministry of Finance originally intended to divide it into three grades, but later, following the demands of the Japanese merchants, it was decided to have two tax rates, namely 2.75 yuan per dan for 23 counts and below, and 3.75 yuan per dan for 23 counts and above. In reality, most of the Chinese yarn is 23 counts and below, while most of the Japanese yarn is 23 counts and above. For example, for Japanese 40 count yarn, valued at 300 taels, the tax is 3.75 yuan. For Chinese 14 count yarn, valued at 150 taels, the tax is 2.75 yuan. This means that for yarn with a difference in value of half, on average, Chinese merchants should only pay 1.875 yuan in unified tax, but they are being over-taxed by 0.875 yuan. The Chinese yarn mills association believes that this tax rate is obviously unfair and has submitted a report to the authorities, requesting a revised and fair tax rate. The following is a translation of the Japanese perspective as reported in the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun for clarification: (The following is a partial translation of the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun) After the implementation of the unified cotton yarn tax, there is no difference between Chinese and foreign yarn mills. It is uniformly stipulated that 2.75 yuan per 100 catties will be charged for 23 counts and below, and 3.75 yuan per 100 catties will be charged for 23 counts and above. After the implementation of this unified tax, what are the advantages and disadvantages for the Chinese and Japanese yarn mills that are in opposition? This is worthy of general attention. The implementation of the unified tax will bring the most favorable conditions to Japanese yarn mills. The initial report said that the unit system would not be used for taxation, and the same type of tax would also be levied on imported cotton yarn, so the threat of foreign cotton yarn can be completely eliminated. In addition, the recent sharp decline in silver prices means there is no hope of recovery for a time, so taxing in gold units at customs is tantamount to increasing tariffs. Imposing a new tariff in gold units on imported goods and a unified tax in silver units on domestic products is the most effective condition for resisting foreign products. Although Sino-Japanese yarn mills in China have the same favorable conditions, the superior position of Japanese merchants over Chinese merchants lies in the division of tax rates, which is the so-called 23 counts as the boundary. The Ministry of Finance’s initial proposal was to have three types, but the Japanese merchants advocated two types, and the result was two tax rates. Chinese and Japanese yarn mills originally had a boundary between coarse and fine yarn. Japanese mills focus on 20 counts and 42 counts, while Chinese mills focus on 20 counts and 16 counts. Now, it is stipulated that 2.75 yuan per 100 catties will be charged for 23 counts and below, so yarn that is close to 23 counts is the most beneficial, which is very clear. Chinese merchants focusing on 10 counts and 16 counts will be at a disadvantage compared to Japanese merchants focusing on 20 counts. As for 23 counts and above, 3.75 yuan per 100 catties will be charged, so there is no disadvantage for Japanese merchants focusing on 42 counts. Moreover, in the future, the upgrading of products will be even more effective in resisting imported goods. Last year, the implementation of the ex-factory tax on tobacco caused Chinese cigarette companies to fall into poverty and be monopolized by British and American tobacco companies. Therefore, the implementation of the unified cotton yarn tax today will not be a loss for Japanese yarn mills. Instead, it can gradually solve the previous problems.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Schedules a Review of the Municipal Business Tax Regulations</h3>
<p>▲ Specific Opinions Will Be Formulated</p>
<p>▲ Representatives Will Attend Based on These Opinions</p>
<p>The municipal government is actively working on the issue of municipal business tax, but the level of the tax rate is crucial to the prosperity and decline of commerce. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously presented a request and was approved by the municipal government to send representatives to participate in discussions on the business tax collection method. After that, it convened a meeting to thoroughly review the fixed rate of the municipal business tax. It is now learned that the case has been reviewed by the review committee and the opinions will be submitted to the Business Tax Research Committee for discussion. The committee has sent letters to the research members, scheduling a discussion. The original letter is recorded below: "Dear Sir/Madam, At the first committee meeting held by this chamber on the 9th of this month, in addition to resolving various principles regarding business tax, three review committee members were appointed to conduct a preliminary review of the draft regulations and tax rates for collection proposed by the Municipal Finance Bureau. The review has now been completed, and a second committee meeting is scheduled for 1 PM on Tuesday, the 24th of this month, to discuss the details so that specific opinions can be formulated as the basis for the municipal representatives to express their views when attending the Finance Bureau meeting. The full review report is enclosed for your reference. Please review it in advance and attend the meeting to share your insights. We look forward to your participation."</p>

<h3>The Silk and Satin Industry Requests a Temporary Exemption from the Special Tax on Textiles</h3>
<p>▲ And Presents Future Standards for Taxation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association submitted a joint report to the Ministries of Industry and Finance yesterday, requesting a temporary exemption from the special tax on textiles. The original report stated: "Concerning the item of textile tax stipulated in the Special Tax Regulations, the tax rate is still under review. We hereby present the current situation of the silk and satin industry, list the future standards for taxation, and request a temporary exemption for several years to allow for recovery, in the hope that you will review, approve, and implement it. It is noted that the special consumption tax regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on December 18th of the 17th year of the Republic of China, Article 2 stipulates that the items subject to special consumption tax include sugar and textiles, etc. Article 4 states that silk tax will be refunded when silk products are taxed. Since the implementation of the 'licentiation fee' system, the taxes that the silk and satin industry should bear are (1) the business tax that each province and city plans to implement, and (2) the special tax that the central government plans to implement in the future. According to the aforementioned regulations, there is no doubt that at a time when the silk and satin business is declining, the implementation of new taxes will inevitably increase the burden and hinder the development of the silkworm industry. Although the special tax regulations are still under review by the ministries, we dare not speculate. However, the Hangzhou Silk Industry Association, because this matter is related to the sideline business of farmers, the livelihood of machine workers, and the business of manufacturers, should be addressed first, and a report was submitted to the ministries, requesting exemption from the special tax within a certain number of years. Considering the situation, it is because the silk weaving factories in Hangzhou have suffered deeply from the impact in recent years that they have made this urgent appeal. The silk industry groups in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have also jointly elected representatives to petition for a temporary tax exemption for three years. The industry's suffering has been detailed in this report, and it is hoped that it will be clearly understood. This association would like to add to the suggestions made by the Hangzhou Silk Industry Association and present them to the ministries. It is noted that since the textile tax is stipulated as one of the special taxes, the association's request for tax exemption may be considered an exception to the regulations, as there is no explicit provision in the regulations. However, the original report has a limitation of a certain number of years, which is different from directly requesting tax exemption. Moreover, according to the precedents of recent years, sugar and iron are both taxable items. However, companies such as National Sugar Manufacturing Company, Puyi Sugar Manufacturing Company, Yangzi Iron Manufacturing Company in Hankou, and Hexing Steel Factory in Shanghai have all been granted special tax exemptions for a certain number of years. These are all exceptions, and sugar is a food necessity, while silk and satin are clothing necessities, and the situations are similar. Moreover, special tax exemptions and the issuance of public bonds are both national policies to rescue industries. However, the silk factory industry issued public bonds this time to rescue the industry after all the silk factories had been shut down, which cost a lot of effort and caused great losses. It is better to take advantage of the fact that the silk weaving industry has not yet been completely ruined and temporarily exempt it from special taxes for several years to allow it to recover slightly and gradually restore industrial and commercial vitality. Indirectly protecting the reality is much more valuable than waiting for the collapse of the silk factory industry and then rushing to rescue it. The gains and losses are far apart. Moreover, comparing the silk and satin industries, although factory silk has Japan as its strong competitor, encroaching on sales channels, it is still necessary for foreign silk factories as raw materials, so various countries tax it lightly, and it is still a major foreign trade to this day. Silk and satin, on the other hand, are finished products rather than raw materials, so they are first subjected to the harsh</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>tax of Korea and then to the heavy tax of Vietnam, and foreign sales channels are almost completely deprived. Although silk and satin are in the same difficult environment, in reality, the silk and satin industry is more urgent than factory silk. This time, the association's request for tax exemption for several years is feared that outsiders may not fully understand their suffering and turn to suspect their intentions of extravagance. This is because they are used to the wrong things being right, and the relationship is extremely important. Therefore, we dare to forget the trouble and hope that the following situation can reach the ears of Qing Dynasty officials. Secondly, the original report of the association has a request for a temporary tax exemption for several years. That is, tax exemption is originally temporary, and the tax rate should be determined first, so that when the tax exemption period expires, the government can follow its own procedures, and the silk and satin industry will not be at a loss due to drastic changes. Article 3 of the Special Consumption Tax Regulations stipulates that the consumption tax rate is divided into three types: daily necessities, semi-luxury goods, and luxury goods, and each is taxed at a corresponding rate. This time, the provinces and cities are implementing business tax and have failed to examine the history and national conditions, and many have mistakenly regarded silk and satin as luxury goods. Since the Ministry of Industry declared that silk and satin are special domestic products of our country and need to be protected, and that their use is also for the daily necessities of the common people, the Executive Yuan issued an order to the ministries and provinces to comply. It has been concluded, and it should be requested to handle the taxation according to the tax standard of daily necessities when stipulating the special tax rate in the future. This will be in line with the Yuan Order and will take into account the commercial situation. It is proposed to apply the daily necessities tax to the special tax on silk and satin, and to temporarily exempt the tax for several years as stated by the Hangzhou Association, so as to allow for relief. It is for the public good to submit all the reasons to the Yuan Department for review and approval. "Sincerely, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<h3>The Hotel Industry Requests Revision of the Business Tax</h3>
<p>▲ Lists Five Points</p>
<p>The Shanghai Hotel Industry Association stated that the business tax rate for the industry is 20 per mille, which is too heavy to bear. Yesterday, they submitted a report to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to forward it to the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Government for revision and reduction. The original report was very long. The summary is as follows: "We are submitting a report to request forwarding. Recently, we read the Jiangsu Provincial Government's regulations on the collection of business tax and the tax rate table, which exceeds the standards issued by the Ministry by eight or nine times. Our industry belongs to the hotel industry, and the hotel industry has always been misunderstood by outsiders as a seemingly prosperous business. However, the provincial government did not carefully examine the situation and hastily set the tax rate for our industry at 20 per mille, ranking it alongside game halls and luxury goods. This seems to be inconsistent with the Ministry's original guidelines. Upon hearing this, all hotels were alarmed and requested a reduction. Our association originally intended to speak out and apply earlier, but we considered that paying taxes to the party-led government is the duty of revolutionary citizens. Therefore, we had to carefully consider the situation from the perspectives of both the higher and lower levels, and act cautiously between ourselves and others. Although we have made every effort to explain, we are unable to bear this excessive burden in fact, and it will also lose its balance in terms of civil rights. Therefore, we must state the reasons for the request for reduction as follows: (1) It is a mistake to regard 'sightseeing' as a standard for business taxation; (2) It is a mistake to rank hotels alongside luxury goods as a standard for taxation; (3) It is a mistake to rank hotels alongside cosmetics and game halls as a standard for taxation; (4) It is a mistake to use the 'licentiation fee' system as a compensation for tax collection; (5) The appropriate and fair tax amount that the hotel industry should pay. The above five points can generally illustrate the difficulties faced by the hotel industry and the fact that it is impossible to levy an excessive amount of tax. The rationale of barely accepting 2 per mille is extremely obvious and can be determined. There are other points that have not yet been mentioned. In this city, there are no losses from the 'licentiation fee' system, and the business tax can be implemented later to allow the people of this city to recover slightly. If it is necessary to implement it, it should be applied equally to both Chinese and foreign businesses. Otherwise, foreign goods will be easier to sell, and domestic products will be hindered from being promoted. As for the hotels with the highest profits, they are the hotels established by foreigners, such as Hua Mao, Li Cha, Da Hua, and other stores. They also lead the way in luxury consumption. The hotels established by Chinese people are not only unable to reach their level, but also only eat their leftovers. Moreover, with the daily decline of the Chinese economy, how many people can afford to stay in hotels and spend money? If Chinese merchants are taxed but foreign merchants are not, the selling price will not be much different, and the Western hotels will be equal or even cheaper, which will inevitably attract Chinese customers to flock to them. The Chinese hotels will suffer a blow, which is not the way for the state to protect businesses responsibly. Our association is concerned about safety and cannot avoid being verbose in order to seek correction from those who know the situation, and we earnestly request your association to forward our request to the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Government for prompt review and approval, and to levy taxes according to the 2 per mille standard set by the Ministry, so as to alleviate the difficulties of businessmen in the hotel industry and allow hundreds and thousands of hotel businessmen and workers to retain a share of their livelihood. We will be grateful for this." Sincerely, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Orders Business Tax on the Silk and Satin Industry to be Collected as Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>▲ Stipulates That It Must Not Exceed 2 per Mille</p>
<p>▲ Has Been Separately Ordered to Provincial and Municipal Governments for Compliance</p>
<p>The Silk and Satin Trade Association stated that the business tax rates stipulated by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for the silk and satin industry were too high to bear, and that silk and satin were daily necessities for the common people, but they were regarded as luxury businesses, which was not in line with the intention of maintaining people's livelihood and promoting domestic products. After convening a joint meeting of representatives from the Hangzhou Silk and Satin Trade Association, it was resolved to base the decision on Article 4 of the guidelines issued by the Ministry, which stipulates that the standard should not exceed 2 per mille. More than a dozen people, including Luo Qinghua, Wang Yansong, Lu Zhengbing, Lin Zhaoren, Cai Liangyou, and Zhu Mouguang, were sent as representatives to go to Beijing with a petition to request a reduction. The ministers of the various Yuan departments of the National Government agreed to adopt their recommendations as much as possible, and the Ministry of Industry submitted its opinions and forwarded them to the Executive Yuan for instructions. The following is the telegram from the Ministry of Industry: "To the Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association, It has been found that in the case of the previous request to review and reduce the business tax on silk fabrics in Zhejiang Province, we have added our opinions and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review and instructions, and have telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government for review and handling.

<h3>The Fujian Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Plant Has Moved to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ More Than 130 Employees Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>The Navy's Majiang Aircraft Manufacturing Plant was ordered to move to Shanghai and be placed under the jurisdiction of the Jiangnan Shipyard in this city. At 1 AM the night before last, all the personnel and machinery of the plant were transported to Shanghai on the Navy's Jing'an transport ship. They stayed overnight at the Songkou docks and entered the port in the early morning yesterday, disembarking at the Gaochangmiao Naval Pier. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited in the afternoon and met with the Deputy Director of the plant, Mr. Zeng Yijing. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Personnel Arriving in Shanghai: Yesterday, there were 12 staff members and more than 120 craftsmen. The Director, Wang Zhu, was ill in Fujian and did not come. The staff members who arrived yesterday included Deputy Director Zeng Yijing, accountants Zheng Baoyuan, Chen Gengyao, Huang Weibiong, Lin Kengran, Chen Liyi, engineers Wang Chonghong and Wang Zongzhu, material managers Shi Shengde and Ding Ting, and engineering auditors Li Chen and Liu Jijiang, etc.</p>
<p>▲ What Mr. Zeng Said: Deputy Director Zeng Yijing told the reporter, "Our plant in Fujian was subordinate to the Majiang Shipbuilding Bureau, which was founded during the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty by Zeng Guofan and was the birthplace of the Chinese Navy. Our plant was established in the eighth year of the Republic of China, when Director Wang Zhu and the four of us had just returned from overseas. Seeing the effectiveness of aviation and hoping to develop it, we established an aviation plant and a manufacturing plant. It has been more than ten years since then, so the staff of our plant are still the first graduates, and the craftsmen were also recruited from ten years ago. During this period, we have manufactured more than a dozen seaplanes, including the Jiang Wei, Jiang Fu, Jiang Ying, and Hai Diao. Due to financial constraints, we have not been able to manufacture actively. With today's hundred or so employees, if we have sufficient funds again, we can manufacture one plane every two months, six planes a year, which is easy. The monthly recurring expenses of our plant in Fujian were 5,000 yuan, but the living expenses in Shanghai and Fujian are very different, so we plan to ask the Ministry to increase it. All the manufacturing machinery was brought to Shanghai yesterday. Fortunately, the shipyard has everything, and if there is any shortage in the future, we can borrow it. The five seaplanes Hai Diao, Hai Peng, Jiang Lu, Jiang Fu, and Jiang Ying have been handed over to the Naval Aviation Plant in Fujian for use, and we did not bring them to Shanghai this time."</p>
<h3>The Anti-Opium Society's Reply to Wu Liande's Letter</h3>
<p>On the 17th of this month, Mr. Wu Liande sent a letter to the Chinese National Anti-Opium Society. The society specially prepared a letter to reply as follows: "Dear Sir, We received your letter on the 14th. Here is a separate reply: (1) After you published an article in various newspapers entitled "The Extremely Toxic Problem of Opium Pills," fair criticisms were published in the Da Wan Bao on February 10th, the Shanghai Shishi Xinbao on February 12th, the Central Daily News on February 14th, the Shanghai Minguo Daily on February 16th, the Millard's Review on February 14th and 19th, and the public opinion circles in North China. Chinese and foreign public opinion unanimously recognizes this claim as a state monopoly, and this association, in order to implement its consistent claims, cannot remain silent. Your letter actually said that "Liande is praised for advocating the state monopoly of opium." Public opinion is like this, there is no need to argue. (2) This association adheres to the late Premier's instructions on anti-opium and represents the public opinion of the people to promote the anti-opium movement. All claims are for the entire action. This protest against the state monopoly of opium is not an individual claim, but the public opinion of the entire association. Your letter involves the association's Secretary-General Huang, which is a misunderstanding. This is hereby stated. (3) You were listed as an Executive Committee member at the fifth annual meeting of this association on December 26th, 1918 of the Republic of China, which was produced legally by election. There is no reason to seek consent in advance. Moreover, you have repeatedly attended meetings, such as on September 30th and December 2nd, 1919, and you personally attended the meetings. How can there be such a thing as "listing a humble name without obtaining prior consent" as mentioned in the letter? This matter concerns the credibility of both parties and should be based on facts to avoid mishearing. In addition to submitting your letter to the Executive Committee, we should reply to you first.</p>
<h3>The Second Branch of the High Court Releases a Political Prisoner</h3>
<p>▲ Fu Yuqin Has Been Approved for Release</p>
<p>▲ The Remaining Prisoners Are Under Review by the High Court</p>
<p>In the case of the National Government's amnesty for political prisoners on New Year's Day in the 20th year of the Republic of China, it was stipulated that the higher courts of each province should organize a review committee to handle the amnesty in accordance with the amnesty regulations. The political prisoners in Shanghai were sent by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court to the Suzhou Higher Court for handling. It is said that the political prisoner cases sent from Shanghai totaled more than 100 cases, involving more than 200 political prisoners, most of whom were young students, and most of the cases were anti-revolutionary and communist. The High Court branch sent the cases several weeks ago, and the Suzhou High Court has not yet completed the review due to careful review and research. It is now learned that only one person has been approved for release because he meets the amnesty regulations. This person is a student named Fu Yuqin from Danxian County, Guangdong Province. He is 23 years old this year. On October 13th of the 19th year, at 12 noon, he carried 18 packages of a book called "Xin Qiongyai" totaling 36 copies, intending to go to the post office to send them to various ports in Tianjin for propaganda. He was arrested by Western patrolman Shaa'er Sipei and Japanese patrolman Shaolin Jiuji on Robert Sun Road in western Shanghai and sent to the court for trial. On November 7th, he was sentenced to six months in prison. The High Court branch received a reply from the Suzhou High Court a few days ago and immediately released him from prison. The remaining prisoners will have to wait until the review and approval are completed before they can be released.</p>

<h3>China Industrial and Commercial Management Association Holds Second Luncheon Discussion Meeting</h3>
<p>▲Chairman Kong Made a Special Trip to Shanghai Yesterday to Attend</p>
<p>▲Speeches by Doctors Dai Leren and Guo Bingwen</p>
<p>The China Industrial and Commercial Management Association held its second luncheon meeting yesterday at the Bankers Club. The association's chairman, Dr. Kong Yongzhi, in accordance with the previous resolution to emulate the Rotary International model, holds a luncheon discussion meeting every two weeks, and insisted on holding the meeting on schedule. Therefore, he made a special trip from Nanjing to Shanghai yesterday to preside over the meeting. Attendees included Liu Hongsheng, Yenching University Professor Dr. Dai Leren, Xu Ji, Zhao Jinqing, Shou Yicheng, Pan Xulun, Qian Chengxu, Zou Bingwen, Yao Yongli, Xu Zhiyi, Zhang Zilian, Guo Bingwen, Chen Liting, Hua Runquan, Tao Leqin, Xu Dinglan, Zhong Ketuo, Chen Fuqing, Zhang Xianglin, Qi Fuming, Li Weimin, Zhu Longxiang, Zhou Zhongqian, Xu Xie Kang, He Dekui, along with Secretary-General Cao Yunxiang and staff members of the secretariat. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Kong. First, Secretary-General Cao Yunxiang led the singing of the China Industrial and Commercial Management Association's anthem, which was adapted from the Yale University football song and was quite interesting. Next, Professor Dai Leren, Director of the Livelihood Improvement Research Association, was invited to speak about the origins of the Livelihood Improvement Research Association and its willingness to cooperate with the association. He also mentioned that the association had invited Professor R. H. Tawney of the University of London to come to China to lecture. Tawney is extremely knowledgeable in industrial and commercial management issues and is currently in China investigating factory conditions. He would welcome members of the association to discuss practical issues with him. Tomorrow (the 22nd), he will give a speech at the YMCA on Sichuan Road on "Factors in the Progress of the British Labor Movement," and he hoped that members of the association would attend. Next, Dr. Guo Bingwen was invited to speak about the British National Industrial and Commercial Discussion Conference, and the organization and work of the Taylor Society of Scientific Management, which could provide many references for China. He also said that scientific management is practical and not just a name. Chinese schools also have specialized departments in factory management, but the theory and practice are not adapted to each other, which is a pity. The association is correcting this shortcoming, and its future success can be assured. Subsequently, Zhong Ketuo, He Dekui, Cao Yunxiang, Zou Bingwen, and others expressed their opinions on developing the affairs of the Industrial and Commercial Management Association. Finally, Chairman Kong gave a speech, briefly stating that the National Government had approved an annual subsidy of 9,600 yuan for the association. He hoped that the association would actively carry out practical research on industrial improvement issues. He also mentioned that 8 million yuan of Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk industry bonds were planned to be used to improve silk industry research and other matters, so that silk factories could gradually implement scientific management methods, and he hoped that other industries would follow suit and strive for improvement, so that a new life for China's industrial sector would be possible. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves, and the meeting ended at around 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>The association believes that there are many issues that should be discussed during the implementation of the Factory Law, so it is scheduled to hold a discussion meeting on the implementation of the Factory Law at the United General Assembly next Saturday at noon. The third luncheon discussion meeting is scheduled to be held on March 7th. It is also heard that Huang Boqiao, President of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, has been invited to speak on "The Self-Help, Mutual Aid, and National Salvation of China's Industrial, Financial, and Engineering Sectors." It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Livelihood Improvement Research Association</h3>

<p>Workers at the Pudong factory of Tianzhang Paper Company went on strike on the 9th of this month because the company representative refused to comply with the government's mediation regarding year-end bonuses and the restoration of work in the cloth sorting room.

Therefore, all the workers unanimously resumed work yesterday, quietly awaiting the municipal government's arbitration.</p>
<h3>Xunwu County Party Headquarters Requests Troops to Suppress Communists</h3>
<p>Xie Pengsheng, the Fifth Company Commander of the 26th Regiment of the Fifth Division, forwarded a telegraphic message from the Xunwu County Party Headquarters of Jiangxi Province to this newspaper yesterday, addressed to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, all division, brigade, and regimental commanders suppressing bandits in Jiangxi, and all newspapers: "Heaven has afflicted Xunwu, and years of chaos have resulted in massacres unprecedented in history. Since the March 25th uprising in the 17th year of the Republic, the death toll has reached over 10,000 to date. No less than four thousand houses have been burned, and the loss of public and private property is estimated at over five million yuan. Corpses fill the valleys, a catastrophe of unparalleled scale. Abdomen ripping and heart digging are inhumane. The bandits' ideology originates from hatred, so they kill anyone they encounter during each uprising. Local tyrants are killed, good people are killed, enemies are killed, and even women and children are killed. Those with confused minds who surrender to the bandits are killed after a short time. Wealthy gentry who join opportunistically are also killed. Initially, a small number are killed, then batches are killed. If the main army does not arrive within a day, the killing will not stop for a day. Recently, 3,000 remnants of Zhu Mao's forces have fled from Nankang and Xinfeng, joining the internal bandits and killing each other. The murderous atmosphere is heavy and the sky is dark. In recent days, they have captured Niudouguang, Chetou, Maoping, and other places, causing great pain and adding to the catastrophe. The people of Xunwu are directly suffering, and the national lifeline is indirectly injured. Although the county police force, together with a company of the Pinglian Defense Army, engaged in a desperate close-quarters battle, and the bandits' momentum was somewhat thwarted after a day of fierce fighting, they are exhausted and out of ammunition. In addition, the disparity in numbers is too great, and the result will ultimately be a defeat. The isolated city is in extreme danger, and the lives of the people are truly pitiful, groaning and waiting for death, unable to last another day. Xunwu is also a part of the country, and the people of Xunwu are also citizens. Rescuing the dying and helping the distressed is our duty. However, the superiors believe that Xunwu is far from the province and beyond their reach, so they have implicitly abandoned it. Reading the newspaper, the Central Government has increased the number of divisions led by Sun, Han, and Xu to four to suppress the bandits in Jiangxi. Therefore, we express our difficulties and dangers and plead with all our hearts, earnestly requesting the prompt dispatch of appropriate troops to pursue and suppress the bandits in the county and eradicate them from the root, in order to save the tens of thousands of dying people. Sending troops one day earlier means one more day of life. Adding one soldier means one more point of strength. Otherwise, the devastation will spread, and the people of Xunwu will have no survivors. We are telegraphing while weeping, not knowing what to say. The Xunwu County Party Headquarters of the Chinese Nationalist Party and the people of the entire county kowtow."</p>

<h3>Trial Opens in the Fuchang Lawsuit, One of Huang Chujiu's Businesses</h3>
<p>▲Company Assets Already Mortgaged</p>
<p>▲Plaintiff Asks for Judgment Before Further Discussion</p>
<p>▲Debate Concludes, Judgment Scheduled</p>
<p>Huang Chujiu operated many types of businesses during his lifetime, and after his death, the Riyue Bank and the Dashijie Amusement Savings were the first to cease operations. Depositors made various claims to protect their rights. In addition to these two businesses, the Fuchang Tobacco Company has also been preemptively seized by the creditor in accordance with the Special District Local Court.</p>
<p>Fuchang was closed because the raw materials for Fuchang Company's manufacturing were supplied by Meihua, Youyi, Meifeng, Lianmei, and other four tobacco leaf companies. It owed Meihua more than 98,800 taels of silver in goods, owed Youyi more than 29,700 taels, owed Meifeng 20,000 taels, and owed Lianmei more than 17,500 taels. There were instances where promissory notes were issued to various creditors, but the payments were not made when due. The creditors filed a lawsuit with the Special Court, requesting a judgment ordering Huang Chujiu's two sons, Xianzhong and Xinyao, and Fuchang manager Yao Jixian, to jointly repay the debts. Fearing that the defendants would hide Fuchang's assets, they requested that the company be sealed first. Since the company has been sealed, tobacco production has also been suspended.</p>
<p>▲Assets Already Mortgaged However, after the seal was issued, the American firm Huizhong suddenly had a lawyer submit a petition to the Special Court, stating that all of the company's assets had been mortgaged to Huizhong, and that other creditors could not interfere. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong opened the trial and summoned the plaintiffs Meihua and others, who were represented by lawyer Xu Shihao, while the defendants Huang Xianzhong and Xinyao retained lawyer Tan Yigong, and Yao Jixian retained lawyer Wu Zhiping to defend them. Huizhong and the New World Hotel also each retained lawyers to attend the hearing, one for the mortgage and one to pursue rent arrears. Judge Xu instructed the lawyer of Huizhong that mortgage disputes could not be mixed with this case, and that if there were claims, a separate lawsuit for execution objection should be filed. He also instructed the lawyer of the New World Hotel that the rent arrears being pursued should also be filed in a separate case and should not be confused with this one. Both lawyers complied.</p>
<p>▲The Defendants' Defense The interrogation began immediately. The representatives of the plaintiffs Meihua and others stated the amounts owed, and the managers of each plaintiff presented the amounts owed by the defendants, some for the price of goods and some for promissory notes, and submitted the notes to prove the amount of the debt. Lawyer Tan then defended his clients, saying that Huang Xianzhong and Xinyao were initially unaware of the amount Fuchang owed, and that the amounts claimed by the plaintiffs in this case were generally correct, but that Fuchang Company was one of five businesses jointly operated by Gongfa Company, and although Huang Chujiu was the general manager of Fuchang, the actual principal was Gongfa Company. Therefore, Fuchang's shareholders are also Gongfa's shareholders. The general manager is only responsible for liquidation. Now that Huang Chujiu is dead, the responsibility for liquidation has naturally ceased. However, Gongfa Company's assets are currently being liquidated, and it is not yet possible to discuss what responsibilities the shareholders should bear. However, the reasons given by the plaintiffs for requesting the preemptive seizure of Fuchang's assets are somewhat false, as there is no possibility of hiding or moving the seized assets. Now that they have been sealed, the defendants have been affected by the business, and the creditors have no benefit to speak of.</p>
<p>▲Proposed Solutions Judge Xu, after listening to the lawyer's statement, instructed that if there were objections to the preemptive seizure, an appeal could be filed in accordance with the law, and the lawyer did not elaborate further. Wu Zhiping, Yao Jixian's lawyer, then stood up and stated that Yao Jixian was originally Fuchang's assistant manager, and Huang Chujiu was the manager. As for the amounts claimed by the plaintiffs, they were correct, but Fuchang was a part of Gongfa. Fuchang was not registered, and Gongfa was not registered either. The tobacco leaves required for Fuchang's tobacco production were supplied by the plaintiffs. At the end of the previous year, the plaintiffs stopped supplying raw materials, so they had to stop work. An investigation revealed that Fuchang's assets were worth approximately 300,000 yuan, and the amount owed was also 300,000 yuan. The three affiliated movie theaters were worth approximately 100,000 yuan in total. In addition, the share capital was approximately 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. On the debt side, it owed Riyue Bank 800,000 yuan, owed various households approximately 400,000 yuan for goods, and owed Huizhong 100,000 yuan in mortgage money. The two do not match by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. These are all the losses over the years. Huang Chujiu held the majority of Gongfa shares, so Fuchang was also his major shareholder. Now there are several solutions being considered to discuss with the creditors in order to minimize the losses. The first solution is for the plaintiffs to continue supplying raw materials so that they can continue to manufacture and sell tobacco and gradually repay the debts. The second solution is to sell all the factory buildings and assets, which would be more profitable than an auction. The third solution is to lease them. The fourth solution is to manufacture tobacco for other companies. However, the plaintiffs do not allow the first solution, and the second solution cannot be found in a hurry. Now, they can only request the court to allow the cross-adhesive strips in the machine room to be changed to straight-line adhesive strips, so that workers can still enter and exit the machine room to manufacture cigarettes. The creditors may send people to supervise, so that Fuchang can resume operations, which would also benefit the creditors.</p>
<p>▲Request for Postponement of Judgment Xu Shihao, the lawyer for each plaintiff, then said that the Huizhong Company had published a notice stating that Fuchang</p>
<p>'s assets and factory buildings had been sold to Huizhong, but today Fuchang's lawyer said that there was only a mortgage. Outsiders cannot understand the inside story. If the preemptive seizure is lifted, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no accidents. (Huizhong's lawyer then submitted the contract, but it was in a foreign language, and it was said that it was not a sales contract, but a mortgage.) Now that the facts are clear and the amount claimed has been acknowledged by the other party, the plaintiff's request should be approved and a judgment should be made in accordance with the law. If the defendant wants to seek reconciliation and has a good plan, they can still propose a solution and proceed with reconciliation after the judgment. Lawyer Wu Zhiping still requested a postponement of the judgment, saying that the judgment would make reconciliation difficult.</p>
<p>▲Responsibility The lawyer Tan Yigong then debated the responsibility of Huang Xianzhong and Xinyao in this case, saying that since Fuchang was an affiliated product of Gongfa Company, the plaintiff should first make claims against Gongfa Company's assets. If Gongfa Company's assets are not enough to repay the debts in this case, then they can seek repayment from the shareholders. However, the shareholders are not only Huang Chujiu, and it is still a question whether this debt was incurred before May 19, 1920, or after. Therefore, Huang Xianzhong and Xinyao are not responsible for repayment and should be dismissed.</p>
<p>▲Judgment on the 28th Lawyer Xu Shihao then rebutted, saying that the internal organization of Fuchang was not well known to the plaintiffs, but the goods sent by the plaintiffs were all stamped with Fuchang's Jiu Xing. Jiu Xing and Fuchang are both Huang Chujiu's businesses, so there is no problem. However, since Fuchang is not registered and is not a legal entity, Huang Chujiu should naturally bear full responsibility. The two defendants are Huang's sons and cannot be exempted. The amounts owed were all after May 19, 1920, so there is no question of responsibility. Lawyer Tan then replied that the notice published by Huang's son referred to Huang Chujiu's personal debts, and Huang's son has not yet expressed his intention to inherit the estate and has already expressed his willingness to hand over all of his father's private property. Since Fuchang is a partnership, Huang cannot be solely responsible. After the debate, Judge Xu adjourned the hearing until the morning of the 28th of this month for judgment.</p>

<h3>Two Long-Distance Bus Companies Increase Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Long-Distance Bus Transportation Company and the Baoshan-Chengsong-Yang Long-Distance Bus Company have submitted reports to the Public Works Bureau, requesting approval to increase fares appropriately in order to compensate for the substantial impact of the recent soaring gold prices on the company's expenses. The bureau has forwarded the report to the municipal government for approval. The price increases are as follows: Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Company, an increase of one to three-tenths of a cent at each station, with a total increase of 1.1 cents for the entire line, making the full fare 7.5 cents per ticket. Chengsong-Yang Company: Chengsong ticket, original price 1.6 cents, new price 1.8 cents; Yangsong ticket, original price 2 cents, new price 2.2 cents; Sanguantang to Chengsong ticket, original price 1 cent, new price 1.1 cents; Sanguantang to Yanghang ticket, original price 1.5 cents, new price 1.6 cents.</p>
<h3>Wusong Telephone Temporarily Unable to Recover</h3>
<p>Due to the continuous rain and snow in recent days, many telephone poles in Wusong Town have been knocked down and telephone wires have been broken, causing the telephone communication to be completely cut off. It has been a week now. Because the Wusong Telephone Bureau has suffered heavy losses this time, it is temporarily unable to recover. Yesterday, the bureau specially sent an engineer to survey the total loss, which amounted to five or six thousand yuan. However, the bureau's telephone service in the entire town and Baoshan has less than 200 subscribers, with low monthly fees and poor business, and has been in deficit for many years. However, because telephone communication is important, it is still trying its best to maintain the status quo. After suffering this major loss, it is difficult to continue to support it. Therefore, after the bureau's engineer surveyed the loss yesterday, the bureau plans to convene a general meeting of shareholders to discuss solutions. The restoration of telephone communication in the entire town may still take some time.</p>
<h3>Unlicensed Rowing Boats Should Be Registered Immediately</h3>
<p>▲And Pay Fines</p>
<p>Chen, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, issued instruction document No. 350 from the Water Patrol Team yesterday, stating: "Regarding compliance matters, it is noted that the municipal government issued instruction document No. 7376, stating: 'It is noted that the rowing boat households Shen Xingquan and others have been rowing boats without licenses in the Huangpu River. The Water Patrol Team has detained the rowing boats that have not been issued licenses and has not released them until now. They have submitted a request to reissue licenses and release the detained rowing boats in order to maintain their livelihoods. The Public Works Bureau was ordered to handle the matter in accordance with the old rules. It has now replied that the rowing boats were detained by the Water Patrol Team of the Public Security Bureau and, in accordance with Article 3 of the original rowing boat penalty rules, they must pay a fine of one yuan and obtain a license. However, the registration of rowing boats has been closed and licenses cannot be reissued. It is difficult to handle. However, the area of these rowing boats is not much different from that of first-class cargo ships, and the styles are similar. It is proposed that these rowing boats be treated as first-class cargo ships, and a fine of three yuan be imposed in accordance with Article 3 of the cargo ship penalty rules, and they be registered and licensed as first-class cargo ships and pay monthly donations, so as to be slightly flexible in the crackdown.' Therefore, in addition to instructing approval to handle the matter in accordance with the above, the bureau is hereby ordered to promptly instruct compliance and implementation without delay. This order, etc.' After receiving the order, the Xu General Team immediately issued a notice, informing all rowboat households who have not registered and have been detained to come to the team to register in accordance with the regulations and pay the fine, and not to wait and see and mislead themselves."</p>

<h3>The Lawsuit over Lawyer's Fees</h3>
<p>In the case of lawyer Dong Qingyu suing Jiang Zhiqing and guarantor Shu Genfu in the French Concession Court for failing to pay lawyer's fees of 400 yuan, a hearing was held again yesterday. First, Shu Genian, the younger brother of Shu Genfu, the owner of the Yongtaichang Tobacco Paper Store, the guarantor, said that his brother was busy today, so he did not appear in court. However, Jiang Zhiqing had previously entrusted the plaintiff to liquidate the Shenyuan Hardware Store,</p>
<p>Although his brother acted as a guarantor, because the plaintiff published a notice in the newspaper on his behalf, the remaining procedures were not followed, so it was not handed over, etc. Jiang Zhiqing's lawyer defended, saying that the defendant Jiang Zhiqing resides in the Public Concession, and the plaintiff should sue in the jurisdictional court, etc. The plaintiff's representative lawyer Dong Yu said that, according to the provisions of the Civil Code, if one of the two defendants resides in the British Concession and the other resides in the French Concession, the plaintiff may choose one location to sue. The plaintiff's lawsuit is not inappropriate. Now, the contract is submitted for your review. The official ordered a postponement of the hearing.</p>
<h3>Runaway Adopted Daughter Returns After Two Months</h3>
<p>▲ Has been married and cohabitating for quite some time</p>
<p>Xiong Baishu, a Jiangxi native residing at 757 Avenue Edward VII, who works in the printing industry, had an adopted daughter named Xiong Xiaolian. She was 28 years old and possessed a beautiful appearance. On the 27th day of the old lunar calendar's tenth month last year, she suddenly disappeared. Xiong Baishu reported the incident to the police and requested an investigation, but more than two months passed without any progress. Until the day before yesterday, Xiong's daughter returned home and recounted the circumstances of her disappearance. She said that on that morning (the 27th of the tenth month), she was lured by Yin Lizhang, a Yangzhou native (Yin and Xiong Baishu were tenants in the same building), to go out and buy cigarettes. As soon as they left the alley entrance, Yin had a car hired in advance, parked nearby. He dragged her into the car, which drove straight to the Huashang Hotel on Haining Road and stopped in front of room number 33. Shortly after, Yin summoned a Yangzhou woman named Cui Tongshi, who stayed with her overnight. The next day, they hired a rickshaw and sent her to Li Moqiu's house at number 3 Qiujiang Road in Zhabei, where she stayed with Li's mother for one night. On the 29th, she was made to marry Li. At first, she was completely unaware, but then she realized what was happening. However, she had no means to resist and had to comply. After cohabitating for two months, she finally seized an opportunity to sneak back, and so on. Xiong Baishu immediately reported this to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched a foreign detective and a Chinese detective named Ju Afu to arrest Yin Lizhang and Cui Tongshi. However, Li Moqiu had already gone to Qingdao to do business, so he could not be apprehended. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Yin and the others to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court. Judge Cheng Shangfeng presided over the hearing. The police's lawyer, Li Zhishan, presented the case. Then, the plaintiff, Xiong Baishu, complained, stating that he had raised Xiaolian from childhood, and she was now sixteen years old. Yin Lizhang had been living with him for about several months, and he explained the previous events. Xiong Xiaolian also testified about the circumstances of her abduction. When questioned, Yin Lizhang confessed that he lived with Xiong. Around September of last year, Xiong's daughter told him that she was being abused by her adoptive father and asked him to find someone for her. He introduced her to Li Moqiu and took her to Li's place, where Xiong's daughter saw him and thought he was suitable. She then married Li. He and Cui Tongshi each received a reward of ten yuan, but Xiong Baishu knew nothing about it, and so on. Cui Tongshi stated that Yin asked her to stay with Xiong's daughter overnight at the Huashang Hotel, and she received ten yuan. She knew nothing else. Judge Cheng announced that the defendants would be detained and a verdict would be delivered next Tuesday. Xiong Xiaolian was allowed to be taken back by Xiong Baishu first.</p>
<h3>Hope for Settlement in He Gengxing Case</h3>
<p>He Gengxing, the former comprador of the hardware department of Mitsui &amp; Co., absconded after embezzling a large sum of money. The two hardware stores he had established went bankrupt at the same time. Mitsui, the creditor, had filed lawsuits in the Special District Local Court one after another. After nearly a year, only one case has been adjudicated, with the remaining two still under trial. The total amount involved in the three cases is approximately 300,000 taels of silver. Yesterday morning, the other two unadjudicated cases were further heard in the eighth session by Ying Shijun, the presiding judge of the Civil Division of the Special Court. Lawyers from both sides were present in court. Under questioning by Judge Ying, it appeared that both parties had the possibility of reaching a settlement. Not only could the two unadjudicated cases be settled, but also the already adjudicated case could be resolved simultaneously. However, it would take some time to complete all the procedures. The presiding judge then granted the request of both parties and adjourned the case until the 27th of this month for further review.</p>
<h3>Theft in the Law School's Female Dormitory</h3>
<p>▲ Coats and cheongsams take flight</p>
<p>During the Double Tenth holiday last year, Sheng Shuzhen, a female student at the Shanghai Law School on Jiangwan Road, returned home. Upon returning to Shanghai, she discovered that her clothing trunk under the bed was missing. This was reported in the previous newspaper. Later, because there was no way to investigate, she could only sigh at her bad luck. Unexpectedly, the other day, room number 9 on the third floor of the dormitory also reported a theft. The incident was discovered by the female students in that room, Jin Guangmei and Wang Zhicheng, and others. After falling asleep that night, they woke up the next morning to find that their clothes had vanished. It was estimated that four coats, two leather cheongsams, and other clothes, as well as silver dollars, worth more than 300 yuan in total, were lost. The rooms on the second and third floors of the dormitory were not locked at night, as the cleaning maids needed to go to the rooms early the next morning to clean. However, the main gate outside the school was always locked every night, so it was not easy for outsiders to enter. Currently, there are no clues to the matter.</p>
<h3>Husband's Difficulty in Pleasing Both Sides</h3>
<p>▲ Only option is to run away</p>
<p>Hu Zhaohong, from Baoying, Jiangbei, is a worker on the Zhengda steamer. He overestimates himself and follows the example of having one wife and one concubine. His wife, Yao, lives in Lujiawan, and his concubine, Xia, lives at the Zhuhang Pier. Hu manages to deal with both women without any complaints. However, women are narrow-minded and harbor suspicions towards each other. The other day, Hu held an ancestral sacrifice at his concubine's place, and Yao went to eat. Somehow, Yao insisted that the rice had a strange taste and stopped eating, firmly believing that Xia had secretly put poison in the food to kill her. Xia claimed that she had eaten the rice in the pot herself and had not died, and that she was being falsely accused. The two women then started fighting. Hu Zhaohong found it difficult to please both sides and took the opportunity to run away. The two women then wrestled each other to the first district's first precinct. The precinct transferred them to the local court for questioning yesterday.</p>
<h3>Employee Commits Suicide Due to Not Receiving a Raise</h3>
<p>▲ Extremely pitiable</p>
<p>Zhou Xiangui, a young man of nineteen, had been working in a foreign goods store at number 209 Shiyi Lane, Nanjing Road. The other night was the fourth day of the new lunar year, when shops traditionally welcome the God of Wealth. Whether employees continue their employment and receive salary increases is usually decided on this night. However, the foreign goods store announced the other night that everyone else was getting a raise except for Zhou. He was extremely frustrated. Around midnight that night, he snuck into the Datong Hotel on Six Horse Road and attempted suicide by swallowing raw opium. Shortly after, the poison took effect and became unmanageable. The bellboy noticed and informed the cashier, who sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment by car. However, he had taken too much poison and eventually died. The hospital reported this to the Fourth Horse Road Police Station, which dispatched patrol officer number 95 to investigate. After the investigation, the body was taken to the mortuary for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Woman Hangs Herself</h3>
<p>▲ Due to husband having an affair</p>

Her mother, Pan Xia, reported the incident to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, stating that Sun Pan committed suicide because her husband was having an affair with Zhou Xuewen's wife at number 12 in the same neighborhood.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Filed After Child Suffocated in Sleep</h3>
<p>Wang Zhenying, from Ganyu County, Jiangsu, lived at number 27 Fu'an Lane, Liyuan Road. Eight months ago, his wife gave birth to a son named A Mao. On the 14th of this month, his wife died of illness. The child still needed breastfeeding, so the wife of his neighbor, Guan Xiaolong, took him to raise, with Wang providing a monthly allowance of five yuan. Unexpectedly, the other day, Guan reported to Wang that A Mao had died. Wang was shocked and rushed over to find his son bleeding from his mouth and nose. He asked what had happened. Guan said that at night, he had inadvertently suffocated the child while asleep when his body pressed on the child's face. Wang was grief-stricken and took Guan to the Second District to file a lawsuit, which was transferred to the local court for handling yesterday.</p>

<h3>Notice from the Cigarette and Exchange Trade Association</h3>
<p>▲ Match Transportation and Sales to Other Ports Still Require Registration</p>
<p>▲ Unregistered Cigarettes Cannot Be Sold</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cigarette and Exchange Trade Association stated that for the wholesale transportation and sale of matches to other ports, registration and a certificate are still required in order to be exempt from taxes and released. All unregistered cigarettes must not be wholesaled or sold. Yesterday, the association's Shanghai South Office issued a notice to all members: "We respectfully inform you that on the 21st of this month, the Shanghai Inspection Office of the Su-Zhe-Wan Area Consolidated Tax Bureau issued a letter stating: 'We have received Instruction No. 920 from the Su-Zhe-Wan Area Consolidated Tax Bureau, which states: In accordance with the regulations, the implementation date for the consolidated taxes on cotton yarn, matches, and cement is set for February 1st. It has been found that some goods that were sold by factories before January 31st and are still in stock at various merchants' stores were originally limited to being sold locally and not allowed to be transferred. However, the stocks in various ports inside and outside the city are very abundant. If they were all sold locally, it would be difficult in practice. We have received numerous requests from merchants to allow for a flexible extension for distribution. After considering the situation, our bureau intends to limit these stocks of cotton yarn, matches, and cement to being allowed to be transported by merchants who submit a letter to the bureau before February 28th, listing the brand names and quantities to be transported. Once verified to be correct, a temporary certificate will be issued for transportation, and no further extensions will be granted. Manufacturers outside the area are also allowed to follow the same procedure to ensure fairness. A new form for the temporary certificate has been drafted and submitted to the department for approval. In addition to publishing a notice to inform all merchants with stock, the corresponding inspection office is being notified to comply. If merchants transporting stock have obtained the aforementioned temporary certificate, they should immediately inspect and release the goods in accordance with the regulations and not cause any difficulties. This order is of utmost importance, etc.' A copy of the temporary certificate form is attached to the station. It was previously reported that Dingchang, Yihexinag, Zhentaixiang, Yongfengxiang, Qiuqianfeng, Shenchangxiang, Xiehefeng, Yichengdong, Dongzhaokang, Gonghexing, and Wanchang, had listed their match stock and requested registration. The Su District Bureau had already been petitioned for instructions on the measures to be taken. We now follow the previous instructions. In addition to forwarding the instructions, we are also urgently communicating this information to you for your investigation and immediate notification to all stores. If there are match stocks that you wish to transport and sell to other ports, you must submit a letter to the Su-Zhe-Wan Area Consolidated Tax Bureau (Xianhaiwei Road) before February 28th, listing the brand names and quantities to be transported, for verification and issuance of a temporary certificate for transportation. Please do not miss the deadline and cause yourself problems. This is of utmost importance. The Inspection Office also stated that Yingri Brand, Lanxing Brand, Jiangtaigong Brand, and three types of cigarettes have not been registered and cannot be approved for distribution. Members must not seek small profits and sell them. Once discovered, they will be directly punished. Please inform them by forwarding this notice, etc."</p>

<p>Art World</p>
<h3>New Demands on Popular Art by Tang Jun</h3>
<p>| Developing towards decorative arts as a foundation for beautifying society |</p>
<p>Because proponents of artistic independence say that the social masses are inherently opposed to unique geniuses, that unique geniuses are fundamentally incomprehensible to the masses, and that art should be isolated from the social masses, standing alone in an "ivory tower," a great misunderstanding arises among the general public regarding the masses and art. They say that art does not belong to the masses, that the masses are fundamentally divorced from art, and upon hearing the phrase "popular art," they exclaim in alarm that pulling art down to the level of the masses would mean the end of art, and that art would perish.</p>
<p>If "popular art" is understood in this way, then what more is there to say? In reality, this is a kind of inherited misunderstanding, and I cannot help but offer some clarification here.</p>
<p>The meaning of "popular art" is not that artists must make their art understandable to the masses, nor that they must pander to the masses. It is not about turning all members of the public into artists. Rather, it means that the public has a certain degree of importance and fondness for art, and that the public has a general capacity for recognition and appreciation of art. In other words, it is about making the appreciation of art "universal" among the masses and making the efficacy and power of art "popular."</p>
<p>Because in certain societies, the appreciation of art is limited to a section of people, or even only a small section, and the efficacy and power of art are only given to a section of people or a small section, there is the promotion of "popular art," in order to enable the majority of the public to have the opportunity to appreciate art, and in order to enable the efficacy and power of art to be given to the majority of the public.</p>
<p>All art inherently possesses "popularity" and "universality." The reason why it sometimes does not become "popular" or "universal" is a matter of improper handling after the art is produced, not a problem with the art itself. It is a matter of art not being applied properly to the masses, not a matter of art not eliciting a response from the masses. The so-called popularization of art is about spreading the soul of art widely into the hearts of the people and scattering the forms of art around the senses of the people, so that their consciousness and senses are subtly influenced by the power of art. Although they cannot create art from innate talent, they can unconditionally and without reason recognize and appreciate art from sensory experience.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to popularize art, the space of nature should be used as an art gallery to display artworks, and various artworks should be poured out as much as possible among the broad masses. At a certain time, the public's appreciation of art may not achieve a considerable effect, but this is only a matter of time</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>question, not a problem of never being infected. For example, after "Cubism," "Futurism," "Fauvism," "Surrealism," and other artworks were first discovered, most of the general public in Western Europe did not understand them, but now they are treated as everyday occurrences. Even the hats and clothing of ordinary women cannot avoid some Cubist patterns, and new-style lines, either square or round, are often seen on earthen tools. This can all prove that the spirit of modern "plastic arts" (D'art Plastique) is universal among the public in Europe and the West.</p>
<p>However, how can art be popularized, and how can the public be universally artistic? This requires appealing to art with universality! Developing towards practical decorative arts. Why does "practical decorative art" hold such great power over the issue of popularizing art and making the public artistic? Please allow me to explain as follows:</p>
<p>Because practical decorative art is intimately related to the public day and night, and its "beautification" of the public is indefinite. No matter how dull or rough the senses of the public are, after a long period of feeding, they will always be considerably affected.</p>
<p>There are two types of practical decorative art: one is purely practical decorative art, and the other is decorative pure art, such as "decorative painting" (Peinture decorative), "decorative sculpture" (sculpture decorative), and so on.</p>
<p>What people generally mean when they say that we can see artworks as soon as we look up in European and Western countries is that these so-called artworks that can be seen as soon as we look up are all decorated artworks, or can even be called decorative art. From this, we can see the prevalence of decorative art in European and Western countries.</p>
<p>Pure art inherently has popularity. If it is used for decoration, it becomes even more popular, allowing the public to recognize it more intimately. As mentioned above, the reason why Cubism, Futurism, and other arts can exert a considerable influence on the public in Western Europe is because they have undergone a process of "decoration," a process of rendering with a more "popular" decorative meaning. Therefore, the public can receive a kind of infectious power in the face of these decorative arts imperceptibly and lead their senses to develop in the direction of art imperceptibly. If art is only placed in a private small house or a museum, it can only infect a section of people or a small section. It is irrelevant to the majority of the public. Although the public sometimes goes to museums to visit, this is just a sightseeing visit, just a kind of</p>
<p>"A fleeting glance," how much influence does it ultimately have on the interest in art? May I ask how many times can they go to museums for sightseeing, or even have never set foot inside in their lives?</p>
<p>Therefore, the advocacy of popular art should be to popularize art and spread art around the public, so that the general public has the opportunity to come into contact with art every day and immerse their senses in the air of art. This consequently creates the power of popular art, and it also lays a solid foundation for the work of "beautifying society." In order to popularize art, it is necessary to make various forms of art public and present various faces of art to the public. Only by making art "decorative," only by opening up the art hidden in personal small houses as much as possible to the vast exhibition halls of public cities, can this convenience be achieved. Only by vigorously promoting the development of decorative art can this convenience be achieved.</p>

<h3>Fudan Photography Annual, Being Edited by Tan</h3>
<p>The Photography Society of Fudan University in Jiangwan has only been established for three or four years, but the works of its past photography exhibitions have unexpectedly given the audience a very deep and satisfying impression.</p>
<p>Recently, their core members Zhao Yun, Zhang Minguang, Xu Pei, Cao Zuguang, and others have been very busy, often holding meetings. It is said that this is because of the upcoming publication of the "Fudan Photography Annual." The first batch of photos that were printed during their winter vacation have already been proofread, and the final batch is now being printed. It is expected to be published next month. The content includes flowers, still lifes, landscapes, human beauty, etc. The paper used for printing is the highest quality yellow cream-colored woodfree paper, which adds to the beauty. As for the origin of those works, they are very strict, selecting the best from the past member photography exhibitions.</p>
<p>| These few pieces of news are all worth promoting.</p>
<p>Speaking of "Photography Annuals," they have long been very popular and developed in European and American countries. Looking back at the Chinese photography art scene, although there has been a phenomenon of rapid progress in recent years, the call to initiate the publication of a "Chinese Photography Annual" was only heard the year before last, but it has not yet been realized. (Although Lang Jingshan and Du Yu have published individual photography collections.) The difficulty of collecting excellent photos is probably one of the reasons, but the lack of a corresponding understanding of the value of photography art by the society and our group may be one of the biggest reasons.</p>
<p>Now, the "Fudan Photography Annual" is about to be published. In addition to our enthusiastic joy, we sincerely hope that the guardians of the yearbook, the editors, will take good care of it. Then this "annual," which is enough to cause a sensation in the photography art world, may coincide with the satisfactory results we imagined.</p>
<h3>Cause and Effect by Yi</h3>
<p>The bell for the first class rang. The students obediently walked into the classroom under the loud sound of the bell to seek limitless knowledge. The playground, where there was almost no room to stand, and the grass, which was usually crowded, were now empty, and not even a single solitary figure could be found. Large schools, because they have one thousand five or six hundred students, are usually noisy as anything, but the sound of the class bell can end everything. Apart from the teacher's explanation and the sound of the wind blowing through the trees, no other sounds could be heard.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi, who sat next to Mr. Wang, took advantage of the lecturer's late arrival to show Mr. Wang Miss Kai's "Luanhe Qiude" (according to the transliteration of Love Letter) that was sent to Mr. Li. Because the distance between my seat and Mr. Wang's seat was not too far, I saw a rough outline of the letter's content. In short, it was nothing more than a few trivial and mushy words. My friendship with Mr. Li also has a long history. I will spare myself the announcement of the contents of the letter. The sound of a cockroach-like leather shoe, from far to near, with a foreign "Miss" carrying a handbag stepping into the classroom with the sound of leather shoes, Mr. Wang and Mr. Shi's conversation ended there, and they quietly listened to the teacher lecturing from the textbook.</p>
<p>After class, Mr. Shi said to me like this, "Yesterday afternoon, I bought some things from outside and returned to school. When I passed the gatehouse, I happened to bump into the postman delivering a bunch of letters. I took the opportunity to take a look, and Li's letter was taken from there. Because I and Mr. Li are in the same dormitory, I know a little about the sender of this letter, and I can determine that it is an 'LL'. Last night I was really bored. Mr. Li, who was in the same room, did not come to school, and only I was left in the dormitory. So I opened Li's letter, copied another one, and still sealed it very carefully for him. My methods are really clever. When I handed this letter to Li this morning, he did not detect the flaws in the letter being opened, and he even thanked me 'soundly.'"</p>
<p>In less than two days, Li had another letter. Mr. Shi wanted to try his old trick again, but this time, not only did he not see the slightest hint in the letter, it seemed that he had told Mr. Li that the last letter had also been opened by someone, because just as he was starting, the recipient of this letter suddenly broke in. At this time, Mr. Shi was at a loss and did not know how to answer his friend. At the same time, his face immediately displayed red clouds, as if expressing thirteen points of apology to Li.</p>
<p>The weather has turned cold due to the seasons. Many students are holding hot water bottles and sitting in front of the south-facing auditorium, seeking warmth from a natural large furnace, the sun. A wave of noisy sounds hit my eardrums. Driven by curiosity, I naturally followed the source of the sound. Walking in the corridor of the school, I heard "Who did this prank?", "The lack of morality has reached its extreme."</p>
<p>"·········Love letter·······" A few words.</p>
<p>After hearing these words, I felt as if I was in a fog, unable to distinguish anything. It was not until I reached the room that I knew that Mr. Shi's "letter" had also been opened and read. Poor Mr. Shi, he still doesn't know what's going on. The noise probably occurred because of this letter.</p>
