<p>時評</p>
<h3>建設廉潔政府</h3>
<p>據前日消息。新政府之組織。刻已具體化。一切「人選」大概皆已「内定。」即北平政治分會。亦將在「事實必須如此」之情勢下成爲事實。吾人處於今日外患日益緊急形勢之下。固切盼能速組統一政府。奠定國基。以内甦民困。外抗强敵。然而吾。人認爲建立新政府。而欲博得人民之擁護。不在於政權之轉移。不在於人物之更替。不在於形式之變動。尤不在於新政綱新文告之昭示。人民今日所要求於新政府者。在質而不在形。在具體事實之表現。而不在於口頭上之鼓吹。人民但希望新政府能從其實質上表現其「新。」而勿徒就形式慶祝其「新。」蓋形式上之「新」不過爲政權之轉換。個人之成功。新的政治喜劇之發端。就國家與人民之立塲而言。固絶無意義也。</p>
<p>吾人今且舉一端爲言。我國二十年來困於官僚政治與軍人政治之深淵。寖以致今日内憂外患交相煎逼之惡果。已如前日本評所沉痛陳述。官僚政治與軍人政治。都以個人利已主義爲其出發點。但有個人之利害。絶不計及其四週之大衆。更不計及整個之國家與民族。惟其利已。惟其逞慾。故其所表現於事實者。第一即爲貪汚。即爲不廉潔榨取人民之血肉。以供一已之享樂。眼看禺衆疾苦。萬民流離。求生無路。歸死無所。而漠然無動於中。吾人試就近二十年來政治舞臺上之人物而觀殆無不一入「官」。門即成「富」。翁宅皆洋式。步皆摩托。姬妾盈前。犬馬盈廐。欵存外行。産置租界。窮極奢侈。務逞個人之私慾。凡此一絲一縷一錢之揮霍。皆爲人民血肉之積纍。搜刮榨取。入士三尺。一家歡笑。萬家號哭。有此快私慾不廢潔之官吏。自形成不廉潔之政府。有此不廉潔之政府。人民自日長困於水深火熱之深淵。</p>
<p>即以目前之事實而論。國家年費百分之八十以上之國帑爲軍費。而士兵之餉　。常長年拖欠治運有費。治河有欵。而洪水泛濫。早先旣無以預防。禍發復無以補救。訓政時期。政重建設。而舉國荒凉。建設之成績。殆無一可舉但見達官顯宦。居尊養貴。面團團而腹便便。但見萬衆戚首蹙額。剜取心頭肉以供政府之誅求。人民擔負公債已逾八萬萬。各省田賦已徵至民國二十三四年。甚且有已至三十年者。誅求於人民者如此其重。人民之所得者究有何物。極目滔滔人慾横流求其能如孫中山廖仲愷諸先生以及一般老同志之終身廉潔自持。毁家以從事於革命者。殆如鳳毛麟角百　一見。此政治之所以長此混亂。亦即人民所以對政府側目而視敢怒而不敢言。無以博得其擁護與愛戴也。</p>
<p>吾人認爲代表民衆利益之革命政黨。以及代表人民利益之人民政府。但有犧牲。絶無權利。但有奮鬥。絶無享樂。蓋政府與人民應爲一體。政府與人民之利益。即應絶不相悖。若民瘠而官肥。民痛苦而官富且貴。則在理論上在事實上。此種政府决無久存之理。中國歷史上之革命運動皆其例證。</p>
<p>今日内政外交。百端都待改弦更張。但建設廉潔之政府。尤爲最先之要着。蓋政府而不廉潔。則百政决無興舉之望。一切徒爲徒爲徒託空言。岳武穆曾有云。「文官不要錢。武官不怕死。而天下太平矣。」不要錢即廉潔也。故吾人際此新政府行將成立之初。敢聲請黨政領袖以最大之决心。作澈底之新生。從個人「不要錢」做起進而建設廉潔之政府。以澄清政治。以救國家於危亡。以拯人民於水火。吾人切盼新政府之新政治領袖從實質上從事實上表現其新。而勿徒基於個人新成功之立塲上。作新的欣愉之歉唱。</p>

<h3>黑馬偶語</h3>
<p>— 夢蝶</p>
<p>前見本欄　在東君以「黑馬」微對。欲頌揚占山將軍·遂有姜君　禪取「紅羊」兩字對之。甚爲工切。余因恩之·尚有「黄龍」二字亦可以對。且「直擣黄龍。」爲岳武穆壯語。又爲北地北事。今暴日來侵。武人皆長蜀如虎。望風披靡。惟占山將軍獨奮雄威。以寡敵衆。屢戰屢克。我國今日之弱如南宋。而將軍之忠勇。髣髴岳武穆也。嗟嗟。剥殘碩果。曙後孤星。風雨鷄鳴。寥天一鶴。吾恨馬將軍之太少也。蓋難能而可貴已。爰就「黑馬黄隴」字。綴爲一聯以張之云。「守土矢孤忠。舉國同瞻黑馬。復仇伸大志。他年直擣黄龍。」蓋將軍之才。不僅足以自守也。至黑馬字若止就字面作對。則凡有色之動物皆可。斯爲無情對。而意義失之遠已。</p>

<h3>章聶二將傳</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>自倭奴侵牟我華。國人義憤塡膺。大有秣馬厲兵。决一死戰之勢。而我輩操觚之土。相率搜討故紙舊册。表揚旣往之殲倭名將。以爲談助。並王士氣。一舉兩得。誰曰不宜。予筆下所述之章聶二將。蓋淮軍後起之秀也。章名高元。聶名土成。俱於甲午之役中。振軍威。立功績。有不可埋没者。章氏雄於膽略。臨陣輒匹馬身先士卒。槍彈横飛。視若無物。人皆以章迂子呼之。章亦因以自號焉。旅順失利。章奉李合肥檄援之。時章方統廣武嵩武及新募福字軍共八營。素稱强悍。奈未出師而旅順已陷。遂奉上旨會同宋慶守牽馬嶺。倭軍來犯。章與之戰。殺敵數千。倭軍望風而靡。旋自引去。旣而宋慶召章磋議軍事。章以合力擊敵請。宋以敗兵之將。而妒章之矯然出羣。聲威勝已也。乃拒而以危禍恫嚇之。章慨然曰。章迂子非弱蟲。甯戰死。危禍不足畏。於是宋益忌之。乃令其移軍守蓋平。章知蓋平爲無險可守之絶地。宋之出此。所以陷已也。但軍令不可違。姑從之。未幾。倭軍數萬來攻。章聲色不動。待敵近。始發連珠彈。殲倭將三。章知倭軍之將大舉來圍。乞師於宋。宋不之應。越日。倭軍果潮湧至。彈如密雨。烟霧迷人。復馳使請宋援。宋駐析木城。仍按兵不發。章以勢孤。力戰一晝夜。精疲彈罄。則更以鋒刃突擊。倭軍爲運屍横遍野。終以彼衆我寡。喪部將李世鴻。李仁黨。楊壽山·張世寳·賈君廉。章不得已。率殘卒衝出重圍。輾轉退守營口。及馬關之約成。章遂歸田。聶士成爲葉志超之部將。牙山之戰。葉軍敗。聶爲所累。相率俱退葉獲罪。聶乃以偏師千人。扼守摩天嶺。捍蔽盛京。倭軍屢犯之。俱爲所擊走。盛京之得保無恙。皆聶之力</p>
<h3>一樣風雪兩地人</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>上海的一座洋樓。室中裝有熱水汀。電氣爐。空氣是十分温暖。主人穿着狐裘。擁着嬌妻。飮着暖酒。吃着火鍋。一面玩當着玻璃窗外飛舞的雪花。主人對這嚴寒的雪天。增加了萬分的興趣。</p>
<p>塞外的一座孤營。營中不時吹進凛烈的寒風。滴水成冰。空氣是十分的凄令。兵士們身着薄衣。手握鐵槍。忍着饑腸。打着寒顫。一面嚴防着敵人無情的槍彈。兵士們對這嚴寒的雪天。增加了萬分的痛苦。</p>
<p>一樣的同胞。爲甚麽在上海安坐的富人。那樣的享福。而在塞外禦敵的兵士們。却是那樣的受苦呢。一樣的風雪。爲甚麽落在上海富人的眼裏。就是快樂。落在塞外抗敵兵士們的眼裏。就是苦痛呢。</p>
<p>在風雪的寒天。我發生了以上的疑惑與感想。</p>
<p>也。庚子義和團起事。八國聯軍至。五月十八日。大沽失守。聶前軍駐守紫竹林。倭軍首到。聶一舉而敗之。死者殊多。他國聯軍繼進。聶與苦戰。以一當百。聯軍知聶之不易勝也。乃用緑氣砲攻之。聶死甚慘烈。嶽嶽名將。章與聶可以　之無愧色矣。</p>
<h3>悼故人徐志摩</h3>
<p>— 吳天放</p>
<p>愚自奉化游山回滬。見報載志摩乘飛機慘隕濟南。爲之愴惘竟日。曁南大學文學敎授顧紅葉。曩寓舊京琉璃門。一日東道治席。客有志摩與愚。酒半。志摩舉尊向愚曰。與球大王盡量。一座皆不知其所稱。嗚呼。志摩蓋愚之故人也。距今十六七年前。愚肄業於武林安定。每爲足球賽。輙任中鋒。時志摩爲一中高材生。來作壁上觀。有時身作戰員。馳迎有力。以是相知有素。往事如塵。今久不爲友知。即愚亦不復有所談憶。而志摩獨能道之。愚雖遜謝不遑。然謂其非愚之故人則不可也。十餘載以來。各以事牽。音書不相達。偶於道上遘覿。彼此一揚手。而風馬雲車。已成過瞥。民十七。愚游彭城。得何君競武之告。始悉志摩居狀。顧卒未獲聚首。每念其文才俊邁。情度倜儻。於同學北大預科時。已驚爲風塵表物。厥後游學海外。輝光日新。歸。與任公適之宗孟諸先生。論文酬酢。並製新詩問世。竟别具風格。由是聲名藉甚。其爲人一生論定。誠如劉海粟先生所謂置於大人物不覺小。擠在庸衆間而不覺大也。天苟假志摩再以三十六年之歲月。則論其壽亦不過七十二。豈即爲世俗所厭。而謂無補於文獻耶。奈何其早逝。而又若是之慘哉。附小詩集襲兩截。以致悼嘆。黄金華髮兩飄蕭。不見蘭旌與桂旄。忽有故人心上過。長天一月墜林梢。汶陽風雨六幕黑。女牆百雉亂紅酣。天意若曰汝母北。我聞隕涕江之南。</p>
<p>▲志摩之喪、旣悼以一文一聯、意有未盡、復成一律句、書而繫於花環以挽之、張孝若</p>
<p>中國詩人獨數君。一飛竟報喪斯文。冰霜哀樂都成夢。文釆風流最不羣。猛虎集成傳絶筆。開山頂上作天墳。年來家國無窮感。野哭哀鴻未忍聞。</p>
<p>▲哀意仍未盡更作二絶、以弔詩人、　張孝若</p>
<p>殘冬絶寒望遼陽。月黑天低敵正强。舉世共愁巢下覆。奈何竟死　家莊。</p>
<p>馳名海國早無倫。肝膽論交見性眞。天外恒河雲樹净。傷心更有老詩人。</p>
<h3>聖誕鷄</h3>
<p>— 小雁</p>
<p>歐西風俗。每年之新歲元旦。及年終之耶蘇誕日。家家户户。治饌必具</p>
<h3>高君珊歐美歸來話國難（三）　寄萍</h3>
<p>譬如前天報上所載特外委會委員長辭呈中有「……數十日以來。世界輿論。對於我國。同情漸集。國際正義。漸見昭著。現在國際聯合會第三次决議案。已經成立。外交方面。告一段落。……」一段。好像此次中日事件。各國很帮忙。我們外交很占勝利的樣子。把東三省斷送了。當然「告一段落」。若把全國斷送了。終於也要「告一段落」。政府當局要是這樣樂觀。呌民衆如何能安心呢。所以我國民衆這樣注意政治。是我們的不幸。不是我們的長處。</p>
<p>近幾天報上常載學生有軌外行動。一般人都引爲隱憂。其實因愛國運動而偶然越軌。也是事實上所難免的。不過如果恃羣衆威力。而欺無抵抗的人。如王福生者。則未免有背愛國運動的最初動機。犯法的人。應照法律辦理。到了今日文明時代。如果竟有如報紙所載之刑訊的行爲。亦必是二十餘人的主張。純正的愛國青年。斷不至有此行動。希望一般學生。要認清目標去幹。不要被少數腐化份子所操縱。而把數月來辛苦奔走的前功。完全歸於烏有。</p>
<p>國際聯盟會。有人說它是五大列　强的分贓機關。可謂言之有理。在國際聯盟會産生的原則上講。本來談不到「平等」兩個字。此次我國遭日本如此重大的壓迫與侮辱。自已無準備。不抵抗。一味夢想依賴國聯的調解。這是根本大錯誤了。我們以極淺顯的眼光來看。就可以明白國聯本身的不平等。不足恃了。</p>
<p>（一）國聯是根據凡爾賽和約而産生。這是歐戰後戰勝國的條約。換言之。即是遷就强國的條約。所以强國與弱國如果發生糾紛。而請求裁判時。强國一定佔便宜。</p>
<p>（二）照盟約的規定。議案須全體同意。方能通過。這種辦法。專予强國以便利。因爲有此規定。强國就可以孤行其是。不必顧到公意了。從前擬定盟約的時候。其居心便不可問了。此次中日事件。日本投一反對票。使其他各國的十三票。不能發生效力。便是我們吃這盟約的虧。若是弱國有什麽特異的主張。祇有屈服於暴力之下。那會有實現的希望。</p>
<p>（三）國聯常任理事五席。爲英·法·德·日·意·五國代表。其餘非常任理事九席·纔由各會員國互選。國聯爲實力派所操縱。其理甚明。</p>
<p>聖誕鷄。聖誕鷄西名turkey。俗呼火鷄。又稱七面鷄。因鷄首紅藍雜色。猙獰而可怕。亦曰白露鷄。蓋在白露節後。始漸漸應市。又名吐綬鷄。鷄身羽毛。有時後尾如孔雀開屏。宛如錦綬。因其名與「土耳其」同。亦呼爲土耳其鷄。邇來耶蘇誕日及新年日近。該鷄遂成西業中之貴品。浙江定海。即地理誌上之舟山羣島。島民除捕魚耕農之外。且養蓄該鷄。自春季孵後。至初冬鷄已長成。鷄以雄者爲貴。巨者重量恒在二三十磅左右。運來海上。售於西菜館。每磅須四五角。靜安寺路二九六號之家庭飯店。其店主何兆裕。爲定海人。乃從其本鄉。自運火鷄來滬。嗜西菜者。啖火鷄必趨家庭飯店。是亦上海吃的常識之一。然歐人除新歲元旦及年終耶蘇誕日外。非宴貴客。不具火鷄。惟耶蘇誕日。因家家户户皆須備此一饌。因復呼之曰聖誕鷄也。</p>
<p>火鷄之味。與中國鷄稍不同。鷄味無油膩。鷄肉亦較中國鷄鬆乾可口。炙鷄之味。尤在掛爐燒鴨上。歐人徵庖廚。每詢其能炙火鷄否。以爲録用標準。亦見歐州人土之重視火鷄也。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>與子同仇（十七）</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第四章　大義滅親</p>
<p>忠淑低着頭。似乎深深思想。室中寂靜得如無人一般。祗聽遠遠軍號的聲音。嗚嗚咽咽。十分蒼凉。良久良久。忠淑抬起頭來。對華乃强說道。不錯。一個人祇有奮勇揀一條路走去。不能兩條路同時行的。權衡輕重。我准依從你的說話是了。乃强聽伊回答了這幾句話。面上便露出驚喜的樣子。灣倒猿腰。向忠淑　很敬重的一鞠躬。</p>
<p>明天的早晨。Ｔ城的風聲急起來了。彭梅國已傳令都下軍隊即日開拔。攻打Ｈ省去。同時又有十數名太陽國的軍官趕來贊助戎機。聽說大砲已運到數十尊了。一般人民又嚇得什麽似的。他們雖不贊成彭梅國有這賣國舉動。但是赤手空拳也奈何他不得啊。彭梅國帶着參謀長和幾個太陽軍官。馬上就要動身出發。忽然一眼瞧見了他的女兒忠淑。早已換了一身軍裝。戴着軍帽。腰裏佩着盒子砲。自外走入。好似一個少年軍官。向鼓梅國說道。爹爹出去打仗。我也要隨着同行。讓我增加些戰塲上的經騐。并且可以保護爹爹。彭梅國不覺笑道。古有花木蘭。今有彭忠淑。眞是無獨有偶。你旣願去。我帶你仝行是了。只是聲到槍砲聲。你不要害怕。忠淑道。爹爹不要輕視女兒。我若畏怯。也不來請願了。左右見主將的女公子也要從戎。都讚一聲女英雄。忠淑見伊的父親已允許了。又說道。女兒的同學華君在此。也願一同出發。彭梅國點點頭道。他要去走走也好。遂見外面又走進一個戎裝少年。向彭梅國行了一個軍禮。站立一旁。彭梅國道。華君你要同行。須隨我一齊努力。嘗轿我並非仰仗外力。自欺同胞。實在我中國内亂已極。一般後生小子爭權奪利。不顧國事。老夫在位久矣。雖無大功。却坐視那些小子飛黄騰達。把百姓蹭蹋得更苦了。所以我此次出兵收復Ｈ省。平定内亂。爲救國護民起見。你該知道。華乃强答應一個是字。他心裏却憤怒得無以復加。暗駡一聲老賊。你明明是禍國殃民。還要說什麽救國救民。廉恥何在。彭梅國遂令二人在身邊相隨。立刻坐着火車出發。浩浩蕩蕩殺奔Ｈ省去。</p>

<h3>厘價下疲不已</h3>

<h3>上週美棉形勢較穩</h3>
<p>紐約十八日來電報告一週中之棉市云、上週棉市殊形平靜、價格上落有限、雖大勢仍無起色、但人心較盬蓋證券漲跌、而於原棉之壓迫、則不免失效、後南方略有套出、但該處之供給仍薄、更以空頭抵補、及同業買進、所以價格仍得維持、日本之重禁金出口及日元之跌價、似足以限制日本在南方之買進現貨、惟以彼曩日所暢進之長纖維棉而論、似已足供其全季之需要、况彼更將停止金本位、則尤足證其紡織業地位臻於良好、俾得與蘭開夏爭雄於世也云、</p>

<h3>糧食　河下米受天雨影響</h3>
<p>▲南頭　昨各帮來源、仍然不多、約抵十餘號、浦存依濃、厚新粳價提一角光景、洋杜尖貨雖不多銷場平常趨勢定局變陰元無所榮辱、</p>
<p>▲新閘　蘇州河下來源不多、河積略有、本街因天雨交易寥寥、但做開行盤、祗同興和豐裕昶祥恒興等四家、約二千擔、明日照貨賣開者、常錫西新及南港薄稻二種、行情各喊角許、其餘之貨尚未做開、小雨關係、船貨均未開斛、</p>
<h3>洋米客銷又停</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、各客帮辦胃又停、惟本街仍有應酬、市面尚能站穩、統市開出一號西貢三百包、價十元○八角、小絞五百包、價九元一角七分、期貨市况、亦居定局、洋行又有抛開、昨日祥茂抛出二月份小絞二千噸、價四兩二錢七分、泰和抛出五月份小絞二千噸、價四兩六錢、由閘北等行客收進、台州白米昨日又有新到、亦由本市成交一千包、價九元六角半至九元二角三分、街形亦居定局云、</p>
<h3>近遠粉均見好象</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後　各月份市面大致轉穩俏之象、以洋麥報價、回漲四五六角左右、兼之金市未受停兌之影響、已轉穩定、近期粉又因南洋帮略有生意買動頗殷、故近遠各期、均見好面、惟廠家方面、因洋麥又定兩船、仍陸續抛出、照此情形、後步實小過漲之望也、結果本月份較前日好一分、一二月份好一分半、三月份好一分、四月份好五厘、五月份好二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥參差不一</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈盤旋之象、本月份因係最後之一日、廠家之收貨、不過二三十車、市上之貨、則頗不少、故趨勢反平、至遠期各月份、洋麥旣報漲、自應提高、惟傳廠家又有洋麥定成、坎拿大紅麥一船一月份裝祗三兩六錢三分、澳洲西部麥、一船四月份裝祗三兩七錢三分、因此人心甚平、遠期反見略小、結果本月份較前日小三分、一月份不動、二月份好一分、三月份小一分、四五月份小二分</p>
<h3>糖市太古糖貨跌步漲</h3>

<h3>絲茶洋莊絲銷幾趨停滯</h3>

<h3>疋頭開水美雨布節節下降</h3>
<p>單面開水美雨衣布、市銷最廣、中西裝俱多需用、本客帮齊有購辦、凡呢絨店號均有經售、每年銷塲有增無减、邇來該類開水美雨布、日見下跌、自外匯先令放長以來、續步下降、前售五兩餘之貨、現一律减至四兩五錢扣佣尚可選色拆疋、其主因、實爲先令放長、定貨激增、進本底廉、聞下月份續有鉅額到申云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤屑售價高漲</h3>
<p>各種白煤屑、近來本埠各煤球廠家、因用途增加、均有大量吸收、致市上現貨流動極少、盤價因而高漲、昨市售開山西煤　、每噸須十兩、較上週售價約漲起七錢半、又紅崎煤屑現貨最缺、買進頗屬不易、每噸售價、亦漲起五錢、現售每噸價爲十一兩二錢半云、</p>

<h3>Japan Forces Our Troops to Withdraw from Jinzhou</h3>
<p>Ultimatum About to be Issued</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to sources in Shenyang, Japan's ultimatum ordering Chinese troops to withdraw from Jinzhou will be implemented soon. It is said that to maintain peace and order in Manchuria, this ultimatum will be issued, demanding that Chinese troops in Jinzhou retreat to a certain point within the customs within a set deadline. Although the above news has not been officially confirmed, responsible parties simply do not deny it. According to sources in Shenyang, the warning will be issued in two parts: one from the Japanese government, delivered to Zhang Xueliang by the Japanese embassy in Beiping, and the other from Honjo, commander of the Japanese army in Manchuria, directly to Zhang's chief of staff, Rong Zhen. It is reported that Honjo will also publish an article stating that if the Chinese troops do not comply with the terms of the ultimatum, the Japanese army will be forced to take decisive action to drive the Chinese troops into the customs.

At 9:00 AM on the 19th, 60 Japanese soldiers arrived at Baiqibao from Liuhegou, claiming to be suppressing bandits and harassing the people. At noon, a Japanese plane reconnoitered the Goubangzi and Dahushan areas. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a Shenyang dispatch, the Japanese soldiers in Dongdaying, originally stationed as a mixed brigade, except for a part heading north to attack Heilongjiang, the remaining 500 cavalrymen left for areas west of Xinmin on the morning of the 15th. On the 14th, five Japanese tanks paraded through the streets to demonstrate their power. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Three Japanese planes destroyed by our side in Goubangzi have been transported to Dongta for repair. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) More than 870 Japanese reservists at the Shenyang Japanese station have been conscripted to fight. It is rumored among the Japanese that the Japanese army will issue an order to attack Jinzhou around the 20th. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>

According to Japanese news reports, various points along the Anfeng Railway line are frequently attacked by bandits. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Zhao Xinbo Writes to Japanese Commander Requesting Suppression of Bandits in Jinxi</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Xinbo actually wrote to the commander of the Kwantung Army, requesting the suppression of bandits in Jinxi. The letter stated: "Merchants and civilians have repeatedly reported numerous instances of alarm, leading to the cessation of various businesses, and grain not being brought to market, which greatly hinders commerce and the people's livelihood. At a time when we are eradicating evil and implementing good governance, the most important thing is to reassure the people. I earnestly implore you to request that the commander, with a compassionate heart, maintain local security and annihilate the bandits in Jinxi to save the people from hardship, for which the people of the province will be endlessly grateful." (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Jiang Zuobin Departs for Home Upon Summons</h3>
<p>Meets with Inukai Tsuyoshi Before Departure</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Chinese Ambassador to Japan Jiang Zuobin is departing for home tonight upon urgent summons from the government. This afternoon, Ambassador Jiang personally visited Inukai Tsuyoshi. It is reported that they exchanged views on a certain important matter for about an hour. The content of the conversation is unknown. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Although the content of the conversation between Chinese Ambassador Jiang and Prime Minister Inukai has not been disclosed, it is generally believed that the issue of starting negotiations between China and Japan may have been discussed, as both governments have changed, and Inukai Tsuyoshi had previously expressed sympathy for the Republic of China and was a friend of Sun Yat-sen. Ambassador Jiang had not been in close contact with important Japanese figures since his meeting with Shidehara in October, fearing that people would misunderstand that China was preparing to negotiate directly with Japan. This visit to the Prime Minister is actually the first since the meeting with Shidehara. (Slightly Adapted Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Returns to London</h3>
<p>Falls Ill from Overwork and Goes to the Countryside to Recuperate</p>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador to Britain Shi Zhaoji left London in September to serve as the chief Chinese representative, attending the League of Nations Council meetings regarding the Manchurian Incident. He overworked himself at the two sessions held in Geneva and Paris, and his health deteriorated. He returned here from Paris today, but his illness has not fully recovered and he still needs rest, so he has gone to the countryside for a few days of quiet recuperation. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japan and Russia Have an Understanding Regarding the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Startling News Reported by British Newspapers</p>
<p>(London) Today, the diplomatic correspondent of the British Daily Telegraph stated that there is some kind of understanding between Russia and Japan regarding the Manchurian situation. This understanding is not purely tacit, but a real understanding. Russia wants to actively exploit what it believes to be Japan's effective occupation of South Manchuria in order to consolidate its power. Japan's occupation of South Manchuria will separate mainland China from Russia's sphere of influence in North Manchuria. Soviet Russia believes that Russia's control over the Chinese Eastern Railway will be strengthened, not weakened, by Japan's occupation of South Manchuria. In other words, Soviet Russia wants to occupy the Chinese land through which the Chinese Eastern Railway passes, just as Japan occupies South Manchuria. Russia has not seriously protested Japan's current actions in southern Manchuria, perhaps because of this. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>United States Sends Note to Japan</h3>
<p>Reiterates Obligation to Respect Covenants</p>
<p>Part of the Liaoning Case Documents Released</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government has sent a note to Japan that is friendly in tone but firm in intent, repeatedly expressing its deep concern about Manchuria. Secretary of State Stimson today instructed US Ambassador to Japan Forbes to declare to the Japanese Foreign Ministry that the US government earnestly hopes that Japan will respect its obligations under the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The Nine-Power Treaty guarantees the integrity of Chinese territory, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact stipulates that war should not be used as an instrument of national policy. Stimson stated today that he is prepared to make available for public viewing all the exchanged documents between the US government regarding the Manchurian Incident, except for certain confidential documents that cannot be published. He is also willing to provide the documents that are not suitable for public release for the senators to read, but they must maintain confidentiality. Yesterday, the Senate passed a bill requesting the release of documents related to the Manchurian issue, hence the Secretary of State's statement today. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After the previous report by a Japanese journalist that US Secretary of State Stimson made remarks criticizing the Japanese government caused a dispute between Japan and the United States, the US authorities, learning from past mistakes, no longer want to make many criticisms about the Manchurian Incident. Now, a certain US news agency has reported again that Stimson recently warned the Japanese government, protesting Japan's active military actions in Manchuria. This report has now been firmly denied by the State Department. According to the report, Secretary of State Stimson had previously instructed US Ambassador to Japan Forbes to express to the Japanese government the US's extreme concern about the situation in Manchuria. This report was immediately denied by the State Department, stating that Stimson had not issued the instruction or directly expressed the opinion to Japan. Officials from the State Department further stated that the US government is still continuing to pay attention to the Manchurian Incident, but has not exchanged any opinions with Japan regarding the Manchurian issue for many days. The State Department is also unwilling to lightly comment on the critical situation in Jinzhou. (National News Agency, 18th)</p>

<h3>Foreign Affairs Committee of the French Chamber of Deputies Questions Briand</h3>
<p>Regarding the League of Nations' Handling of the Liaoning Case</p>
<p>(Paris) The members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies submitted written questions regarding the situation in the Far East, the meeting of the League of Nations Council, and the resolutions made. Foreign Minister Briand attended this afternoon to answer them one by one, explaining for about two hours. The members were satisfied. Briand answered the questions from Conservative member Scapini, explaining why the League of Nations Council cited Article 11 of the Covenant to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute. The member's intention was that Article 11 could be invoked in the event of a danger of war, but the League of Nations had no right to directly intervene between the two parties. Article 15 of the Covenant applied to acts of war, and if it had been invoked at that time, the League of Nations' actions would have been more forceful. Briand replied that the plaintiff, China, had proposed a selected procedure. Since that country had chosen to use Article 11 of the Covenant, the Council could not change it. At this time, Socialist member Longuet rose and said that some of the provisions in Article 15 were inconvenient to implement, because this article allowed both parties to take any measures to protect their claims. In other words, it was not impossible to engage in military force. There were also other questions, one of which concerned the issue of neutral zones, saying that it was proposed by China, but the European powers refused to guarantee the safety of such zones. Briand replied that the Chinese government had not made any proposal for the establishment of neutral zones in Manchuria. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<h3>Central Committee Members in Nanjing Hold Discussion Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Decide to First Form the Secretariat of the Plenary Session</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng Recommended as Secretary-General</p>
<p>Committee Members Freely Express Their Opinions</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony to Be Held Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee members in Nanjing held their first discussion meeting at the Central Party Headquarters on the morning of the 19th. More than 40 people attended, with Yu Youren presiding. Chiang Kai-shek also attended and formally exchanged views on the preparations for the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee. The atmosphere was very harmonious. It was decided to first form the secretariat of the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee, responsible for carrying out everything. Wu Tiecheng was recommended as the Secretary-General, with Zeng Zhongming, Liang Han Cao, Chen Bu Lei and Cheng Tianfang as the Secretaries. The organizational regulations of the Secretariat are to be drafted immediately and established before the 21st. All proposals from the representatives of the Fourth Plenary Session in Beijing and Guangdong will be sorted out separately in preparation for submission to the First Plenary Session for discussion. The various review committees to be set up and the candidates for the review committee members to be nominated will be decided at the preparatory meeting. The issue of remedying the ten Central Committee members elected in Shanghai was also discussed at today's discussion meeting, but no method has yet been decided and will be discussed further after Wang Jingwei and the Guangdong committee members arrive. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(          ) The Central Committee members in Nanjing held the second discussion meeting on the 20th to continue exchanging views so that all the procedures of the Plenary Session would be more complete. It is reported that after the Plenary Session opens, it will first discuss the resolutions of the Shanghai Peace Conference, followed by the organizational plan of the National Salvation Conference. The various proposals of the delegates of the Fourth Plenary Session in Beijing and Guangdong, or new proposals submitted by the Central Committee members at the time, will be submitted for discussion in turn according to their nature and weight. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee members here are eagerly awaiting Wang's arrival in Beijing. In addition to Chiang sending a telegram in a personal capacity to urge him to come quickly, Wang's wife, Chen Bijun, and Liang Hancao and Zeng Zhongming were also recommended to go to Shanghai by train on the night of the 19th to welcome him and report on the progress of the discussion meeting. It is reported that Wang is determined to come to Beijing by train on the night of the 20th despite his illness. If his illness has not fully recovered, he will bring a doctor with him. It is also reported that Central Committee member Liu Shouzhong recently sent a telegram to Beijing reporting that Feng Yuxiang and Zhao Daiwen have decided to come to Beijing together to participate in the Plenary Session. It is not yet certain whether Yan Xishan and Lu Zhonglin will come together. Now, the Beijing side will send a plane to welcome Feng and others after their travel schedule is confirmed.

<p>(Nanjing) In the discussion meeting on the 19th, Chiang Kai-shek, Lin Sen, Wu Jingheng, Wu Chao-shu, Chen Bijun, Li Wenfan, Wu Tiecheng, Zou Lu, Chen Gongbo, He Yingqin and others all spoke, and the arguments were mostly focused on the issue of unity. There was also an exchange of opinions on the election of the ten Central Committee members in Shanghai. Everyone felt that this matter seemed to be lacking in terms of law, but in this extraordinary period, in order to seek thorough unity, it was only necessary to weigh the situation and reason and find a perfect method to resolve it. As a result of the talks, it was decided to wait until the Central Committee members from Guangdong come to Beijing before submitting a decision. According to a certain member who participated in the meeting, this matter is unlikely to cause problems. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The joint secretariat has been organized and is actively preparing for the meeting. However, the originally scheduled meeting date of the 21st is only one day away. The two batches of Central Committee members from Guangdong traveling north are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 21st, and the Northern Committee members have also sent telegrams to report their departure south, but many of them will not be able to arrive by the 20th. Therefore, the plenary meeting on the 21st may have to be postponed, or only an opening ceremony will be held. After the committee members who are en route to the north and south arrive, the official meeting will be held. Therefore, whether or not the plenary meeting will open on the 21st will be determined by the newly established secretariat, depending on the number of Central Committee members arriving in Beijing on the night of the 20th. It seems that the opening ceremony will be held first on the 21st, followed by the preparatory meeting, so that all the issues can be publicly discussed a second time, so that both parties can have more opportunities to talk. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The various groups in Beijing are preparing to welcome Wang today, and are very busy. Banners welcoming Wang have already been seen on the streets. Sources from the Guangdong committee members said that Wang will definitely be able to come to Beijing to participate before the meeting. All the committee members from Nanjing and Guangdong are delighted that Wang is able to come to Beijing despite his illness to jointly formulate national policies to save the country. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain committee member, there will be no meeting on the 20th. The opening ceremony will be held on the morning of the 21st. The preparatory meeting has not been scheduled. The official conference will have to wait until the second batch of Guangdong committee members arrives in Beijing. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>Su Bingwen and Others Telegraph That Manzhouli is Peaceful and Secure</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian Committee previously received reports that Mongolian cavalry had entered Hailar, and that Gui Fu was plotting independence. It specially telegraphed Su Bingwen, the commander of the Hulun-Hailar section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and Chun De, the special commissioner for consolation, to inquire. Su replied, "The Mongolian banner is deeply aware of the righteousness and will never take any unusual actions. Since the Northeast Incident, people's hearts have been floating, rumors have been rampant, and villains have been provoking, all of which are not credible. Although Jiangyuan has been occupied by the Japanese army, Manzhouli is peaceful and secure as usual. Bingwen is ordered to garrison the border, and his responsibility to defend the territory is heavy, and he will do his best to resist foreign aggression and prevent disasters." Chun De replied, "Deshen Banner has returned to Hulun, and I am shocked by the urgent telegram. Now Manzhouli is peaceful and secure as usual, and the Mongolian and Han people are in harmony. The report that Mongolian cavalry entered the seaport and that Governor Gui is plotting independence is all false. Since De is entrusted with the mission of consolation, if such a thing had happened, how dare De conceal it? Please do not easily believe the rumors." (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>French Government Issues Statement Denying Troop Increase at Guangxi Border</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Paris government telegraphed French Ambassador Wilden, stating that recent reports in Eastern newspapers about French troops invading the Guangxi-Yunnan border are astonishing and baseless. France has not increased troops in the Sino-Vietnamese border area recently, and the original garrison was very small. Any troop movements are normal. The French government is responsible for declaring that it has not increased troops on the Sino-Vietnamese border and that no soldiers have invaded the Chinese border. The report is completely false. French Counselor Handewis has written to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to correct the reports. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Central Government's Financial Difficulties</h3>
<p>Continued Promotion of Financial Public Bonds</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reduced figures, the government's monthly expenses require 18 million for military expenditures and 4 million for administrative expenditures, totaling 22 million. This month's revenue is only 4 million, a shortfall of 18 million. The financial minister, regardless of who it is, has no solution to secure funds. This is a point of concern for the Nanjing and Guangzhou committees. It is also the most difficult problem for the new government. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Financial circles report that there has been no impact on the financial market after Chiang's resignation. During the transition period, the public bond market has not been disturbed.

<h3>National Government Sternly Orders Local Officials to Stop Students from Overstepping Boundaries</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government telegraphed military and political authorities in all locations on the 18th, stating: Urgent to all Pacification Commissioners and Provincial and Municipal Government Offices: Since the Liaoning-Jilin Incident occurred, students in various places, motivated by righteous indignation, have flocked to Nanjing to petition and demonstrate. Their patriotic enthusiasm is commendable. However, in recent days, the number of people arriving has increased, and the participants have become more diverse. Moreover, communists have infiltrated them, leading to various illegal and undisciplined actions, such as destroying institutions, disrupting transportation, assaulting Central Committee members, hijacking vehicles, attacking passersby and public officials, and privately arresting and interrogating people, destroying social order.</p>
<p>Friendly foreigners are astonished. If this continues, the country will be ruined. The government initially showed tolerance due to the youth's patriotism, but recent events show that true patriots would not do such things. It is expected that the majority of pure students will not approve of the actions of violent elements, and they will not be coerced by violent elements. The government bears the heavy responsibility of maintaining order. If it does not promptly stop these actions, how can it stabilize the people's hearts and pacify the common people? It is hereby ordered that all Pacification Commissioners and Provincial and Municipal Government Offices must strictly prohibit student groups from traveling to various places to demonstrate. Local military and civilian officials must be responsible for strictly prohibiting such activities. If dangerous situations occur, they must take immediate action and must not make excuses for failing to dissuade them after the fact. This is extremely important. Printed by the National Government.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Building a Clean Government</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's news, the organization of the new government has taken concrete form. All "personnel choices" are generally "pre-determined." Even the Peiping Political Council will become a reality under the circumstances that "facts must be so." We, in the face of the increasingly urgent foreign troubles today, firmly hope to quickly form a unified government and establish the foundation of the country in order to alleviate the people's suffering internally and resist powerful enemies externally. However, we believe that establishing a new government and wanting to win the support of the people does not lie in the transfer of political power, the replacement of figures, the change of form, or the announcement of new programs and new proclamations. What the people demand of the new government today lies in substance, not form; in the manifestation of concrete facts, and not in the promotion of words. The people only hope that the new government can show its "newness" in its substance, and not merely celebrate its "newness" in form. Because the "newness" in form is only the transformation of political power, the success of individuals, and the beginning of a new political comedy. From the standpoint of the country and the people, it is completely meaningless.</p>
<p>Let us now give one example. Our country has been trapped in the abyss of bureaucratic politics and military politics for twenty years, gradually leading to the present evil consequences of internal and external troubles, as was painfully stated in the previous editorial. Both bureaucratic politics and military politics take individual egoism as their starting point. There are only personal interests, and no consideration is given to the surrounding masses, let alone the entire country and nation. Because of their self-interest and their desire for power, the first thing they show in fact is corruption, that is, uncleanly extracting the flesh and blood of the people to provide for their own enjoyment. Looking at the suffering of the people, the wandering of the people, the lack of means to survive, and the lack of places to die, they are indifferent. If we look at the figures on the political stage in the last twenty years, almost all of them become "rich" as soon as they enter the "official" gate. Their houses are all Western-style. Their steps are all motorized. Concubines are in front of them. Dogs and horses fill the stables. Money is deposited abroad. Real estate is placed in concessions. They are extremely extravagant and want to satisfy their personal desires. All these threads, strands, and pennies of squandering are the accumulation of the people's flesh and blood. They are plundered and extracted. The officials smile, but ten thousand families cry. With such officials who do not abandon cleanliness, an unclean government is formed. With such an unclean government, the people will be trapped in the abyss of water and fire.</p>
<p>Taking the current facts as an example, more than 80% of the country's annual expenses are for military expenditures, but the soldiers' salaries are often in arrears for many years. There are funds for water management and river management, but floods are rampant. There is no way to prevent them in advance, and there is no way to remedy them after the disaster. During the period of political tutelage, construction was emphasized, but the country was desolate. The achievements of construction can hardly be mentioned. We can only see that high officials and dignitaries live in honor and wealth, with round faces and big bellies. We can only see that the masses frown and take out the flesh from their hearts to supply the government's demands. The people's burden of public debt has exceeded 800 million. The land tax in various provinces has been collected until the 23rd or 24th year of the Republic of China, and even until the 30th year. What do the people get from such heavy demands? Looking around, human desires are rampant. Those who can be as clean and self-disciplined as Mr. Sun Yat-sen, Liao Zhongkai, and other old comrades, and who destroy their homes to engage in revolution, are as rare as phoenix feathers. This is why politics has been chaotic for so long. It is also why the people look at the government sideways and dare to be angry but dare not speak. They cannot win their support and love.</p>
<p>We believe that revolutionary parties representing the interests of the people and people's governments representing the interests of the people have only sacrifice and no rights; only struggle and no enjoyment. Because the government and the people should be one, the interests of the government and the people should never be contrary. If the people are poor and the officials are fat, and the people are suffering and the officials are rich and noble, then in theory and in fact, such a government has no reason to exist for a long time. The revolutionary movements in Chinese history are all examples of this.</p>
<p>Today, domestic and foreign affairs are waiting to be changed. However, building a clean government is the most important thing. Because if the government is not clean, there is no hope for the rise of all policies. Everything is just empty words. Yue Wu Mu once said, "If the civil officials don't want money and the military officials are not afraid of death, the world will be at peace." Not wanting money is being clean. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of this new government, we dare to ask the party and government leaders to make the greatest determination to make a thorough new life, starting with individuals "not wanting money" and then building a clean government in order to purify politics, save the country from danger, and save the people from water and fire. We sincerely hope that the new political leaders of the new government will show their newness in substance and in fact, and not merely base themselves on the standpoint of personal new success to make new and joyful songs.</p>

<h3>Prince Saionji's Condition Worsens</h3>
<p>Former Minister of the Army Nami Departs for Liaoning Tonight</p>
<p>Military Headquarters Strives to Realize the Establishment of a Governor-General in Manchuria and Mongolia</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: Prince Saionji, a senior statesman who is recuperating in Okitsu, specially summoned Dr. Katsuji of Nagoya Medical University to diagnose him yesterday. Due to his old age and weak body, he has contracted a cold and bronchitis at the same time, and his condition is getting more serious.</p>
<p>▲ Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: General Nami is scheduled to depart from Ofuna Station at 10:40 PM tomorrow to go directly to Liaoning Province.</p>
<p>▲Another telegram: Regarding the issue of the Governor-General system in Manchuria, Cabinet Secretary-General Mori Ke and Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Isoe have repeatedly exchanged views and tried to find a compromise between the cabinet and the military headquarters. However, the government believes that whether the policy towards Manchuria is effective depends entirely on the attitude and policy of the government, and new systems such as the Governor-General system cannot achieve full purpose. The current cabinet has decided to reject the weak diplomacy of the Wakatsuki cabinet and establish a diplomatic policy based on the hard-line policy towards Manchuria decided by the Tanaka cabinet at the Oriental Conference at that time. Therefore, there is no need to establish the Governor-General system early. The military headquarters still adheres to its position and strives to realize the Governor-General system. It is feared that a compromise between the two sides will be difficult to achieve for a while.</p>
<h3>法國會通過造艦程序</h3>
<p>▲Paris, 18th (National Press) - The French parliament has passed the 1932 naval construction program. This plan requires a total expenditure of 1,216,000,000,000 francs, to build eight new warships, including four 7,500-ton cruisers. Although France is complying with the naval construction moratorium proposed by the participating nations at the League of Nations, its moratorium only applies to the completion of new warships, and therefore does not conflict with the current naval construction program passed. The French parliament had previously passed a naval construction plan before the summer recess; this is the second time. Furthermore, the naval construction program based on the Five-Power Treaty of the Washington Naval Conference in 1924 is still ongoing. This program stipulates that 240,000 tons of new warships will be built by the end of 1936, with 196,799 tons replacing old warships. Although France is currently preparing for disarmament, Foreign Minister Briand solemnly declared to the League of Nations that France's reduction of armaments must be proportional to the guarantee of security it receives. In essence, this means that without a guarantee of military assistance, France cannot reduce its armaments. The French claim that France is the last country among the great powers capable of defending against the spread of communism in Europe, and therefore must have adequate naval and land forces to uphold its political主張.</p>

<h3>德著名冶金廠停頓</h3>
<p>受經濟恐慌影響</p>
<p>▲Berlin, 18th (Reuters) - The renowned German Borsig Machine Factory has suspended payments today due to low orders and significant losses in overseas business caused by currency depreciation. However, the suspension is limited to the Borsig factory in Berlin and does not affect the parent company, which has factories and mines in Upper Silesia. This factory was established 80 years ago, and 80% of its products are sold to India, Egypt, and the Far East, employing 4,000 workers. It is hoped that work can be maintained until February of next year, as there are still orders worth millions of marks that have not yet been delivered. In addition, the famous Thyssen ironworks will also suspend work for two weeks from December 20th due to a lack of orders.</p>
<p>▲Berlin, 18th (Havas) - Another company has been added to the list of German industrial circles suffering from economic and financial panic today. The Borsig Metallurgical Factory, which manufactures locomotives in the suburbs of Berlin, has recently suspended payments. The factory has 3,700 workers and employees and is quite large. It is currently engaged in negotiations to try to save it. Apart from Krupp, this factory is one of the leading private metallurgical companies in Germany, founded in 1837 by the locksmith August Borsig. The first German locomotive was built by this factory in 1841.</p>
<h3>唐古倫黨陰謀暴動</h3>
<p>斐當道預有戒備</p>
<p>▲Manila, 19th (Reuters) - The Tanggulang Party, composed of disgruntled people from the provinces of the Philippines, had previously planned to gather in Manila on December 18th to join forces with the bandit party of Fu Di to attack various government administrative offices. However, as of today, the Tanggulang Party's plan to attack Manila has not materialized, reportedly due to the fact that the party members in the province of Rizal have not yet completed their preparations. Yesterday, the whole city was in panic, and all the Chinese shops closed early to prevent looting. Today, the police are still seriously patrolling the key areas leading into Manila, with troops stationed to prevent party members from breaking in. The customs authorities have also dispatched motor launches to patrol the Pasig River to prevent party members from invading by waterway. The leader of the party, Almajara, was previously detained and released on bail, and was arrested and imprisoned again yesterday. The authorities will charge him with treason.</p>
<h3>蘇俄改進報紙宣傳</h3>
<p>▲Moscow, 18th (National Press) - According to a recent announcement from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the party's propaganda organ, Pravda, will start printing the same newspaper in fourteen major cities from January 1st of next year. This is one of the party's newly established propaganda plans and is closely related to the Five-Year Plan. According to the new plan, the newspaper's daily circulation will increase to over four million in the future. The printing method involves delivering various news items to various cities by airplane, and then typesetting and printing them within a few hours for simultaneous publication. However, Pravda is not the largest newspaper. There is also a peasant newspaper that plans to adopt this delivery method, and its circulation will increase to five million copies. In addition, a semi-official newspaper called Izvestia will also implement the new plan, and its circulation will increase to 2.5 million copies. Furthermore, the construction of major Russian paper mills will be completed soon, and the paper produced will be sufficient for the expansion of major newspapers.</p>

<h3>公電</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, Shi Qingyang et al. telegram - Respectfully to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government Military Commission, all levels of party headquarters nationwide, all army general commanders and commanders, all army division and brigade commanders, all provincial and municipal governments, all mass organizations, all schools, and all newspapers. The Japanese bandits have penetrated deeply, and the situation in the Northeast is urgent. The French masters are eyeing the border, and frequent alarms are being sounded in the Southwest. Recently, we have received repeated telegrams stating that the French imperialists are scheming to invade along the Yunnan-Guangxi border, and the disaster is profound and urgent, no less than that of Japan. Please allow us to present this to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the southwestern authorities, and the elders and brothers throughout the country: (1) On the 13th and 14th of last month, two French aircraft entered our airspace and flew to Longzhou to reconnoiter the situation. (2) After the Shenyang Incident, the French newspapers in Hanoi advocated for Japan, saying that Japan safeguards Western culture and treaty interests and can serve as a model for Europe. (3) According to a telegram from the 3rd of last month, France has completed the construction of an airfield in Liangshan, and troops have been increased in all border areas. (4) According to a telegram from the 28th of last month, the Vietnamese government, in addition to recruiting new soldiers, is also summoning retired soldiers from more than ten years ago for training in Hanoi, with a five-month term, preparing to be deployed to various locations. (5) The roads within Vietnam have been extended to our border areas of Ping而 and Shuikou, and the width of the roads has been expanded. In addition, barracks capable of accommodating a division have been built in Liangshan. (6) Vietnam has banned the export of grain this year and is absorbing cash. (7) On the 20th of last month, 70 or 80 French soldiers crossed the border without reason, attacked farmers in Gaolü Village, and looted wantonly. A few days ago, they also entered Aidian. French soldiers also entered Yunnan Province to harass. (8) According to a telegram from the 8th of this month, France transported cannons, rifles, ammunition, and 20,000 sets of military uniforms to Liangshan and distributed them to retired soldiers. (9) According to a telegram from Guangxi on the 9th of this month, the French have recently transported most of the troops from Africa to Vietnam, along with countless military equipment and supplies. The above are all confirmed news. In addition, there is news of British troops increasing their presence in Pianma. If our government and people do not quickly plan for defense and eliminate the hidden dangers, I fear that the southwestern territories will soon become a continuation of the three northeastern provinces. We, feeling that the situation is dangerous and urgent, cannot bear to sit idly by. Therefore, on the morning of the 12th of this month, we convened southwestern comrades at the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters to discuss countermeasures. We decided on six principles: (1) The southwestern provinces will work together to resist foreign aggression. (2) The National Government is requested to convene a southwest border defense conference immediately and establish a southwest border defense committee. (3) The National Government is requested to pre-allocate funds and equipment and to construct southwest border fortresses and complete southwest transportation in sections. (4) Actively organize the militia in the southwestern provinces to serve as the government's rear support against foreign aggression. (5) Strictly prevent internal traitors from undermining the united action of the Southwest to resist foreign aggression. (6) Organize a foreign affairs association in the southwestern provinces, and immediately select people from each province to prepare everything, which can be announced soon. We deeply believe that the national crisis is deepening, dictatorship has not been overthrown, and the establishment of a unified government will take time. The officials in charge of our Southwest, having assumed the responsibility of defending the territory, should formulate a plan to protect the country. While there may be territorial divisions internally, there should be no distinction between each other in resisting foreign aggression. If they can quickly catch up, unite, adopt the principles decided by us today, adhere to strategies, rectify military preparations, train the people, gather talents, revitalize internal affairs, and promote transportation, then we will be prepared for any eventuality, consolidate border defenses, and will not be like Zhang Xueliang, who offered no resistance and willingly abandoned territory and lost power. We are extremely anxious in this telegram. Shi Qingyang, Yang Xingtao, Li Renren, Huang Jun, Huang Xiao, Xie Weiping, Yan Chongyang, Mo Jiying, Ma Yuechuan, Zhou Bogan, Huang Fusheng, Zhang Gan, Zhang Yunliang, Miao Ruoxu, Zhu Qingsheng, Xiao Shouyi, Huo Guanghe, Tang Dean, Huang Yixiang, Wei Renzhong, Yu Zuming, Wang Gongdu, Gao Xuan, Gong Zhilin, Yang Maozhang, Ming Wei Bei, Ou Fangpu, Su Minsheng, Li Qing, Du Zhiyuan, Su Shuyan, Zhang Mingjiu, Wang Suxi, Li Shishu, Chen Jingxiu, Wang Jundong, Yin Jianhua, Li Boshen, Yu Yunlan, Wu Zhaoxian, Guo Zihuo, Fang Naibin, Mo Yiyong, Wei Yong, Huang Yiduan, respectfully submit our document with seals.</p>
<p>要聞</p>
<h3>日政府議建東省新行政區</h3>
<p>▲採取統治朝鮮制度</p>
<p>▲軍部主設滿洲總督</p>
<p>▲推翻漢奸之維持會</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence: The Japanese government is currently studying the establishment of an administrative district in the Eastern Provinces and organizing the highest organ to govern Manchuria and Mongolia. Since Japan forcibly occupied the Eastern Provinces, it has repeatedly incited the Manchus to organize an independent government. However, due to the opposition of the general Chinese traitors, the restoration movement has become a bubble. The political power of Jilin and Liaoning is still executed by the "Four People's Maintenance Association" organized by Chinese traitors such as Yuan Jinkai. Recently, the government suddenly proposed to establish a new administrative district in the Eastern Provinces, overthrowing all the rights of the Chinese traitors, adopting the system of governing Korea and Taiwan, and not establishing an autonomous state by the Manchus. Regarding the implementation methods, the Japanese government has secretly studied with the military several times. According to the government's opinion, it wants to first organize a "Four Heads" government in the Eastern Provinces, with the Army, the Kwantung Government, the Consul General, and the South Manchuria Railway jointly forming the Manchuria-Mongolia Summit Conference, inviting the Governor-General of Korea to participate and prepare a plan for governing the Eastern Provinces. However, the military's Minister of the Army, Minami, has a slightly different opinion from the government, advocating expanding the powers of the Governor-General of Kwantung, with the government appointing a Governor-General stationed in Manchuria, or the government dispatching a high-ranking official similar to the Governor-General to be stationed in Manchuria, establishing an administrative district built by the Japanese themselves, and resolutely excluding the existing political power of the Chinese and Manchus in the Eastern Provinces. If this is because it is currently a time of military and political affairs with China, a Governor-General's Office can also be established in the Eastern Provinces, with a general-level figure as the head. The Governor-General's Office would be divided into two departments: a staff department and an administrative department. All Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria would be controlled by the Governor-General, and there would be no need to consult the government on matters. The administrative department would govern the provinces, cities, and counties of the Eastern Provinces and also manage all industries, transportation, and construction projects. Furthermore, in view of the disadvantages of the governance system between India and Korea, the military is resolutely advocating adopting a military system for the Eastern Provinces administrative district, opposing the "Four Heads" government proposed by Prime Minister Wakatsuki and Foreign Minister Shidehara. If either the Japanese government's or the military's proposal is established, the map of our country's Eastern Provinces will have practically changed, and the Japanese's long-standing ambition to occupy the Eastern Provinces will become even more evident.

<p>Damei Evening News, Shenyang, December 18:</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Colonel Magee, military attaché of the U.S. Legation, and Colonel Sandys Hill, military attaché of the British Legation, have been residing in Jinzhou for the past three weeks, inspecting everything. They arrived here from Jinzhou this afternoon and stated that Japanese warplanes had dropped 26 bombs in the Jinzhou area, 23 of which caused much damage. This occurred within the past two days. However, the communique issued by Commander Honjo's headquarters did not mention this, only stating that Japanese reconnaissance planes had flown to Jinzhou to inspect the Zheng-Tong Railway's condition, as Japanese had invested in the railway. It was also stated that Japanese planes had dropped 18 bombs near Panshan, 17 of which exploded. Colonel Magee personally inspected the locations where the bombs had landed and saw that each bomb weighed about 200 pounds and was deeply embedded in the ice-covered ground. He estimated that the material damage was minimal and that no one was killed or injured. Both Colonel Magee and Colonel Sandys Hill emphatically denied the claim that Chinese soldiers near Jinzhou had increased in number, and they denied the claim made by the Japanese military headquarters here that Chinese troops were advancing towards Shenyang. They stated that the Chinese troops in Jinzhou had absolutely no intention of invading, and were only seeking a place to sleep at night and a full meal during the day. Even the stragglers entering the villages between Jinzhou and Shenyang were only trying to find food and lodging and had no intention of provoking the Japanese soldiers. The claim that Zhang Xueliang was funding so-called guerrillas to harass the Japanese along the South Manchuria Railway was also deemed incredible. The two officers, Magee and Sandys Hill, have scheduled a meeting with Commander Honjo tomorrow morning, but the purpose of the meeting is unknown. Today, the Japanese military authorities also announced that there were bandits near Shenyang and Changchun, one of whom was a group of bandits who kidnapped 70 Chinese women with the intention of extorting ransoms. This statement has not been verified. It was also stated that there are currently 8,000 Chinese troops gathered at Baiqibao, west of Xinmin.</p>
<h3>臧式毅捕闞朝璽</h3>
<p>▲日軍縱匪擾害外商</p>
<p>Damei Evening News, Shenyang, December 18: Zang Shiyi, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government, has been under house arrest by the Japanese since the Shenyang Incident on September 18. In reality, he was only released by the Japanese two days ago and placed back in the chairman's position under Japanese control. Yesterday, Zang ordered the arrest and imprisonment of Kan Chaoxi, an important member of the Maintenance Association. The reason has not yet been announced. Also, according to the American Petroleum Company here, since the Japanese troops occupied Shenyang on September 18, no fewer than 20 of the company's branches and management offices in various parts of southern Manchuria have been looted by bandits. There has been a significant loss of stored kerosene. These branches and management offices are all managed by Chinese, and in the past two years, none had been robbed. Now the local situation is extremely serious, and it is very dangerous for the company to transport the stored oil to the interior of the three eastern provinces for sale. Although the records of banditry cases registered by the American Consulate and other foreign consulates have not been published, it is said that almost all of the cases currently compiled are reports of losses suffered by foreign merchants in the interior of Manchuria due to banditry. These robberies have all occurred since the Liaoning Incident.</p>
<h3>外艦潛赴粤海岸測量</h3>
<p>▲偷攝地形測量水線</p>
<p>▲當局派艦實力制止</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: While the external troubles are becoming more urgent and the northeast region has attracted the attention of the world, at the same time, the southwestern frontier is also coveted by foreigners. Taking advantage of our increasingly urgent external troubles, the ambition of foreigners has recently become unrestrained. The authorities have been reporting for days that foreign warships have been found secretly taking photographs of the terrain and measuring the harbors of Chixi and Yamen on the southern coast. According to Jiang Qihua, the magistrate of Chixi County, at 11:00 a.m. on the 2nd of this month, a large white ship with a yellow chimney, resembling a Japanese warship, was discovered in the waters off Huangmao Island in the county, sailing around and taking measurements. It left at 5:00 p.m. He immediately went to various parts of the coast to conduct on-site investigations and further learned that six of these warships had been sailing in the waters off Gaolan Island in the 8th district of Zhongshan County in the past two or three days and had planted many markers along the coast. The details are as follows: (1) On the mountain of Duya Island facing the sea of Baishi Township, Duhu District, Taishan County, there is a white cloth flag with a length of about one foot and a width of eight feet, with no characters. (2) On the highest peak of Gaolan Island in the 8th district of Zhongshan County, there is a black cloth flag of the same size as above, with no characters. (3) Also, at the foot of the mountain on the southern Jingkou coast of Gaolan Island, there is a wooden board with a width of eight inches and a height of more than eight feet, with no characters. (4) On Hesetu Mountain, which is distant from Gaolan Island, there is a black cloth flag of the same size as above. (5) On the high mountain of Dajin Island in the county, which is about fifty or sixty miles away from the county seat, there is a white cloth flag of the same size as above. Just as we were about to report, secret agents reported that a Japanese warship, white with a yellow chimney, was still hiding in the sea between Dajin Island in the county and Hebao Island in Zhongshan County, shining searchlights all night to spy on our coasts. After investigating, it is certain that the ship's secret entry into the interior seems to be taking measurements of the terrain. However, it is not clear whether it is a Japanese warship or a warship of another country because its actions are erratic. We will continue to investigate. According to Wu Fengsheng, the magistrate of Xinhui County, on the 29th of last month, a British twin-chimney gunboat sailed to the Yamen sea and anchored. Two electric boats came with it, carrying two Westerners and dozens of Chinese, measuring the coast along Yangguan, Shangxia Sha, Jiaobeishi, Luohuan, Dahu, and Erhu. They also erected small black and white flags as markers. The ship sailed away on the evening of the 1st of this month. When customs officers questioned the British ship's crew, they replied that they had measured the water depth here more than ten years ago, and because it had been so long, they had come to measure it again. After receiving the report, the military authorities, considering that foreign relations are currently urgent and that British and Japanese warships have successively come to the sea frontiers to secretly measure the terrain and waterlines in the important sea forts, which has significant implications internationally, have instructed the county magistrates to investigate and prevent them at any time. They have also sent a telegram to Navy Commander Chen Ce, requesting him to dispatch a ship to remove all the small flags erected by foreigners. After receiving the telegram, the Navy Headquarters dispatched the Zhongshan ship on the 11th to handle the matter accordingly. (December 14)</p>
<h3>鄂綏靖署卽成立</h3>

<p>▲第四師全部扺漢將協助剿匪</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The reorganization of the E' provincial pacification headquarters from the Hankou military affairs headquarters has been rumored for a long time. However, due to the fact that the new organizational law has not yet been promulgated, the establishment has been delayed. He Chengjun believes that banditry has resurfaced in various counties of the E' province, especially in the Xiang River area, which is a haven for thieves. In order to eliminate them as soon as possible, the pacification headquarters should be established to command the various armies to be responsible for suppressing them. He specifically planned to go to Beijing on the 16th to visit Jiang for instructions in order to start the organization. Just as he was preparing his luggage, Jiang's telegram of resignation arrived in Hankou, so he suspended his trip and sent Chen Guangzu, the chief advisor of the military affairs headquarters, as his representative. Chen took a plane to Beijing on the 16th and returned to Hankou on the 18th. The organizational law of the pacification headquarters was also promulgated at the same time. He then decided to formally abolish the military affairs headquarters within a few days and establish the pacification headquarters. The content of the organization and internal expenses will be reduced to 15,000 yuan per month, so it is simpler than the military affairs headquarters. The personnel from various departments will also be transferred from the military affairs headquarters. As for the troops responsible for pacification, in addition to the original armies stationed in E', the 4th Division and the 83rd Division will also be transferred to E' to assist. The entire 4th Division, led by Division Commander Xu Tingyao, recently arrived in Hankou from Bian. It is said that the 83rd Division will also continue to arrive. After that, the military strength will be greater, and it will be easier to suppress the bandits. (December 18)</p>
<h3>閩黨政軍會勘烟苗</h3>
<p>▲漳泉各地烟苗甚盛</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Government sent a telegram to the Central Government requesting that senior officials be sent to Fujian to investigate the opium seedlings. The report has already been reported. However, the fact that opium is being planted in Fujian has become an undeniable reality. In Zhangzhou, where the planting was first started, the opium is about to be harvested. In Quanzhou and Xinghua, the opium seedlings have emerged to about one foot in height. Even in Funing, where the planting was last started, the seedlings have sprouted. Even in the southern district of the provincial capital, planting has begun. Therefore, the Provincial Government has decided to divide the province into four districts according to the investigation methods of last year: Funing as the first district, Xinghua as the second district, Quanzhou as the third district, and Zhangzhou as the fourth district. Two officials from the Provincial Government, the Provincial Party Department, and the Security Department, as well as one member of the Marine Corps and one member of the 49th Division, will be divided into two groups. Each group will have one member from the Provincial Government, the Provincial Party Department, and the Security Department. The first and second districts will be investigated by personnel from the 49th Division, and the third and fourth districts will be investigated by personnel from the Marine Corps. The Provincial Government has also sent a letter to the Party Department and the military, requesting them to designate personnel as soon as possible so that they can depart on time. These committee members have the power to dispatch troops to eradicate opium seedlings in the designated areas, but it is not known whether they will be able to do so thoroughly. Also, the Anti-Opium Support Association of all sectors of the provincial capital convened a meeting of various groups on the 14th at the County Party Department and resolved: (1) Please the Provincial Party Department to order the Party Departments of various counties to organize Anti-Opium Support Associations to lead the people to oppose opium planting. (2) For the protection of opium planting by the garrison troops, if they are national defense troops, please ask the Ministry of Military Affairs to deal with them severely. If they are provincial defense troops, please ask the Provincial Government to deal with them severely. If they are Marine Corps, please ask the Navy Department to deal with them severely. (3) Please ask the Provincial Government to dismiss and severely punish county magistrates who conceal opium seedlings in their counties. (4) Please ask the Provincial Government to implement effective opium prohibition measures. (December 15)</p>
<h3>長沙破獲僞造特稅印花案</h3>
<p>▲僞造印花約值數十萬元</p>
<p>▲民衆團體請裁特稅機關</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The establishment of the Special Tax Clearing Office in the two Hunan provinces has been three years, and the dark幕 and the事營私舞弊 have long been rumored to the outside world. It is unexpected that a case of counterfeiting huge amounts of stamps has recently been discovered. On the 25th of last month, the Changsha Garrison Headquarters inspected the lottery tickets of various stores in the city and found more than 10,000 special tax stamps in Qingfengxiang Store on Fuzheng Street. Most of them were腐朽 by insects. After discovering that they were fake stamps, they asked the store owner about their origin. According to the store owner, they were deposited by Songqin Paper Store across the street. The inspectors then took the old man Hong Pengju of Songqin Paper Store and the fake stamps they found to the headquarters for interrogation. Commander Hu of the Garrison Headquarters reported that he interrogated the paper shop owner, Hong Pengju, that night. Hong Pengju供称 that the stamps were printed by Wang Shirong, a former special tax office clerk, in March of this year, totaling more than 30,000. They have been all printed. Except for Wang to take 10,000 stamps, all the stamps have been kept in the money shop across the street (where the case was solved). He stated that the printing fee was 60 yuan at that time, but because only 10,000 stamps were taken, he only paid 20 yuan. After hearing the confession, Commander Hu arrested Wang Shirong, a former clerk of the Special Tax Office Inspection Section Wang Xiaonan, who introduced the printing and said he was only introducing the printing. As the case was重大, Commander Hu transferred the entire case and the criminals to the Fourth Route Command and requested investigation. The Chief of Staff of the Ministry, Liu Yinggu Bi, transferred the entire case to the Military Law Office and asked them to handle the case severely. The office has复讯 several times, and the confession of the criminals is still the same as that of the Garrison Headquarters. The case is very重視 and because of the special tax relation of the divisions and salaries. If the corruption happens, it will not only影 the tax revenue but also危 the military salaries. Therefore, the师长 advocates a彻查办 strictly. It is said that He Jian has also noticed the case and has issued a通缉 to all criminals. The organizations and various Party departments in this city, in addition to asking the government to investigate the case嚴辦 also proposed that顺应 the public opinion to the central government and that the Hunan Province Special Tax 기관 be裁彻 to eliminate the corruption to 民害.

<h3>Jinpu Railway Traffic Interrupted Again</h3>
<p>▲ Large Group of Students Gathering in Yanzhou</p>
<p>▲ Railway Bureau Forbids Carrying Students to Beijing</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Students from various schools in Yanzhou, Jining, Caozhou, Tai'an, and Qufu are gathering in Yanzhou to petition in Beijing. Yesterday (the 16th), the southbound train No. 201 on the Pingpu line reached Tai'an. Over two hundred students from the Third Tai'an Middle School and the County Normal School forced their way onto the train. When the train arrived in Yanzhou, students gathered at the Yanzhou station and forced all passengers off the train so they could board. The station, having received prior orders not to transport students to Beijing, immediately telegraphed a report to the Jinan Railway Affairs Section. The section chief, Fang Bolin, both telegraphed the Railway Bureau for instructions and went to the provincial government to meet with Han Fuqu to discuss solutions. The provincial government immediately telegraphed the leading officials of various agencies in Yanzhou to go to the station and dissuade the students. The students remained resolute and refused to listen. As of this morning, the train has still not departed, and the stationmaster has absconded. The Jinpu Railway Affairs Office issued a public notice at 1:00 AM today, ordering southbound trains to temporarily travel only as far as Tai'an and northbound trains to temporarily travel only as far as Tengxian, awaiting further instructions before proceeding. As a result, both the southbound train No. 201 and the northbound train No. 2 complied with these orders this morning, and Jinpu Railway traffic has been interrupted once again. Travelers heading to Beijing from Pingjin are lamenting endlessly, with some disembarking in Jinan. This morning, Jinpu Railway Affairs Section Chief Fang Bolin received another telegram from the Railway Bureau reiterating the prohibition against transporting students to Beijing. Fang is currently taking the telegram to the provincial government to meet with Han and discuss solutions. The outcome remains unknown.</p>
<p>According to a report received by the Education Department from Zhao Derou, the principal of the Fourth Rural Normal School in Yanzhou, the students gathered in Yanzhou include those from the Third Tai'an Middle School, the County Normal School, the Third Vocational School in Yanzhou (only three students from that school), the Fourth Rural Normal School, the Second Normal School in Qufu, the Private Mingde Middle School, and the Seventh Middle School in Jining, totaling about one thousand students. Additionally, Xu Meisheng, the principal of the Fifth Middle School in Linyi, also telegraphed the Education Department reporting that the entire student body of his school had also resolved to petition in Beijing, were fully prepared to depart, and were not heeding any dissuasion. As the school is in Linyi, which is not connected by train, they will either travel by car or on foot, likely gathering in Zaozhuang before boarding a train south. (17th)</p>
<h3>A Portion of Japan's Illegal Pending Cases (5)</h3>
<p>▲ Conflict Between Japanese Soldiers and Police in Tieling: Unauthorized Arrest and Humiliation of the Security Team Case On September 30 of the 18th year, a conflict occurred between Japanese soldiers in Tieling County and soldiers from the county's security team due to a minor argument. The Japanese soldiers retreated and assembled a force of over one hundred soldiers, surrounding the security team's headquarters. Both sides of the main street were filled with their formations. The security team tightly closed its doors. Just as the director of the negotiation bureau and the section chief of the county government, together with the chief of the Japanese police station, arrived to investigate, the Japanese consul and the commander of the Japanese army regiment also arrived. While they were in the midst of discussions, the director of the negotiation bureau went to find the head of the public security bureau to be responsible for maintaining order. The Japanese soldiers took the opportunity to pry open the main gate and stormed into the headquarters, disarming the security soldiers and ordering them, along with nearby merchants who were also detained, to kneel on the ground, subjecting them to all kinds of humiliation. Before leaving, they tied up over thirty officers and soldiers, seized numerous firearms and bullets, and destroyed the equipment of several families nearby, including Yang Juqi's, looting their clothing and decorations. The detained soldiers suffered severe torture. After negotiations, the soldiers and firearms were gradually returned. The negotiation bureau, based on the seven conditions proposed by the county government, negotiated with the Japanese side for punishment of the perpetrators, compensation, apologies, guarantees, and assurances that Japanese soldiers would not enter the interior armed without notifying and receiving permission from the Chinese side in the future. A satisfactory resolution has yet to be reached.</p>
<p>▲ Fuzhou Japanese Merchants' and Taiwanese Residents' Perpetual Lease Land Tax Deed Case Japanese merchants and residents of Taiwanese origin in Fuzhou only register their business addresses with the Japanese consulate and do not follow formal procedures by submitting their deeds to the Chinese authorities for verification and tax stamping. Among them, Taiwanese residents account for eighty or ninety percent, often leading to disputes over property rights. The former Fujian Negotiation Office repeatedly sent letters to the Japanese consul stationed in Fuzhou between October and December of the 18th year, requesting that he instruct Japanese residents to submit their deeds to the Chinese authorities for verification and tax stamping in accordance with past practices, and declaring that if they failed to comply, the Chinese authorities would not recognize any future disputes. However, Japanese residents have consistently refused to comply. In February of the 20th year, the Chinese side brought this matter up in negotiations with the Japanese ambassador, who claimed that the Japanese government had never recognized this procedure and should not forcibly enforce it on Japanese residents. The Chinese side discovered that British, American, and other foreign merchants in Fuzhou, as well as churches in the interior, have always submitted their deeds to the Chinese authorities for verification and tax stamping for all their perpetually leased land and buildings, without exception. On the Japanese side, the Bank of Taiwan, the Japanese Residents' Association, and the Bo'ai Hospital have also complied with the aforementioned procedures. Therefore, the Japanese ambassador's claim that this procedure had never been recognized is untrue. In May of the same year, a letter was sent to the Japanese ambassador requesting that he instruct Japanese residents to comply, but no reply has been received.</p>
<p>▲ Killing of a Fanyang Farmer by Japanese Soldiers Case On October 17 of the 18th year, a farmer from Shenyang was shot and killed by Japanese guards while passing by the side of the South Manchuria Railway. After an investigation by the local authorities and discussions, the Japanese guards claimed that they were within their guard zone and had the right to exercise their guard duties, and therefore were not responsible. The Fujian Farmers' Association submitted a report to the central government, which forwarded it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that the Liaoning Provincial Government earnestly negotiate. However, they have yet to comply.</p>
<p>▲ Yanji Japanese Police Surround a Branch Office of the Xilin River Self-Defense Corps and Arrest a Teacher Case At 4:00 PM on January 13 of the 19th year, Takeda Hakuji, an assistant police inspector from the Japanese consulate branch in Toutaogou, suddenly led twenty-one armed Japanese police officers and surrounded the Xilin River Self-Defense Corps branch office, claiming they needed to speak with Han Xingli, a reclaimed land resident from the Eleventh School (the school and the branch office were located in the same courtyard). While the school principal and the team leader were inside the office negotiating with him, the Japanese police outside enticed Teacher Han out and took him away. The Toutaogou Commercial Port Branch Bureau negotiated with the Japanese consulate branch, which claimed that they were acting on orders from the consul-general and had already taken him to Longjing Village. The special envoy from Jilin negotiated with the Japanese consul-general for his release, demanding punishment, apologies, and guarantees, among other conditions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also sent a letter to the Japanese ambassador requesting that he instruct them to comply. The Japanese ambassador replied that the matter had been discussed and resolved satisfactorily between the director of the Yanji Municipal Preparatory Office and the Japanese consul-general. However, according to a report from the Jilin envoy cited by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Han Xingli had not returned to school. After repeated urging, the Japanese ambassador was instructed to handle the matter swiftly, but no reply has been received.</p>
<p>Case of the Japanese Ship Toyomaru Smuggling Military Supplies On February 23 of the 19th year, the Japanese ship Toyomaru secretly transported military supplies into China, totaling one hundred and five boxes of firearms, ammunition, and medicine, which were seized by the Shidao Customs. Together with the local military police, they detained the Japanese national Fujita Tokichi and others, along with the military supplies. The Japanese consul stationed in Yantai requested that the Japanese nationals be guarded by the consulate. On March 8, the Japanese consul personally took them away, stating that he would be responsible for returning them and guaranteeing that the Toyomaru would not leave the port. The next day, the Japanese warship Kusaki led the Toyomaru out of the port. After negotiations with the Japanese consul, he replied that the ship had been damaged while unloading the military supplies, so he had ordered it to sail to Dalian for repairs. The Chinese side sent a letter to the Japanese ambassador, requesting that he instruct the Japanese consul in Yantai to return the Toyomaru and its crew for legal proceedings. The ambassador replied that the Toyomaru's departure for Dalian for repairs at the time coincided with the Japanese warship's return to Lushun for Army Memorial Day, which was a misunderstanding. He also stated that evidence had been collected from the Yantai Qingdao Kwantung Leased Territory regarding the perpetrators in this case, and a strict trial was being conducted.</p>
<p>▲ Case of Yanji Japanese Police Arresting Jin Rensan, Deputy Chairman of the Farmers' Association Jin Rensan, the deputy chairman of the Shangyi Township Farmers' Association in Yanji, was arrested by Japanese police and sent to the Japanese consulate on April 30 of the 19th year. Prior to this, on April 13, Japanese police arrested over twenty students in Longjing Village. On April 14, they arrested Li Yuanshi, the head of the first section, in Toutaogou, and arrested over fifty teachers and students from a reclaimed land school and section head Jin in Xiaowudaogou, as well as Yang Taixi and others from Beigou reclaimed land. The Yanji Municipal Preparatory Office and the Longjing Village Commercial Port Bureau repeatedly protested and negotiated with the Japanese side, but the Japanese side always used forceful arguments and refused to comply. The Yanji Municipal Preparatory Office then sent a letter through the Jilin Special Envoy, which was approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to protest to the Japanese ambassador, requesting that he instruct the local Japanese consul to release all of them immediately, but no reply has been received to date.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Tragedy Caused by Showing a Movie According to those coming to Shanghai from Songjiang, there is a Songwei Long-Distance Station building at the Malu Bridge in Songjiang. The Yuying Primary School borrowed the building to show movies and host various recreational activities to raise funds. It was originally scheduled for ten days. The seventeenth evening was the third day. The garrison troops in Songcheng sent inspection teams in shifts to check the premises. On that evening, seven military police were present first. When the tax police entered, they were refused entry by the military police and left. After returning to their unit, the tax police gathered many of their brothers, initially planning to question the military police. Seeing a large group of armed soldiers arriving, the movie theater closed its iron gates. The tax police could not enter, leading to a standoff. The situation became extremely tense in an instant. Both sides opened fire. Platoon Leader Li of the tax police pleaded on his knees, but he was shot and killed on the spot. Another tax policeman was also shot and killed on the spot. When the two sides clashed, the audience, including men, women, children, and the elderly, cried and screamed loudly. After the gunfire started, everyone lay on the ground. Fortunately, various agencies heard the alarm and rushed to the scene to suppress the situation, allowing the civilians in the theater to be released first. Then, the officers ordered everyone to return to their respective units. (18th) The deceased have already been collected by personnel dispatched from the County Court for an autopsy.</p>

<p>Tenth District Chief Resigns Due to Boundary Dispute Wang Yingyi, the district chief of the Tenth District of this county, resigned yesterday after a dispute arose over the proposed merger of Taiping and other townships into Fengxian, resulting in the destruction of the district office. The county government approved his resignation and temporarily appointed Zhang Jin'ou, the district chief of the Fifth District, to serve concurrently.</p>
<p>Murder of Husband by Wife and Lover in the Fifth District Qu Gensheng, who ran a small shop in Tangjiao Village, Nicheng, in the Fifth District, had a wife, Hu, who was secretly having an affair with Hu Xianglou. Their passion was intense. Yesterday at twelve o'clock, Hu Xianglou and Hu took advantage of Qu's deep sleep to strangle him. Qu cried out for help, which was heard by Zhang Guichun, a neighbor, who rushed to investigate. He encountered Hu Xianglou hurrying out, looking panicked. Zhang immediately grabbed him and entered the house, where he found Qu strangled to death. He immediately handed Hu Xianglou over to the Nicheng Public Security Bureau that night, who, together with the Fifth District Office, sent him to the county for questioning.</p>
<p>Discovery of Hermaphrodite Female Prisoner The Zhangjiang Defense Regiment arrested eight suspects the day before yesterday, including a female prisoner named Zhu A'bao. After interrogation by the county court, she was ordered to be released on bail. However, because she was from out of town, no one was willing to bail her out, so she was temporarily detained in the women's prison. Today, the prison guard reported that although Zhu A'bao is female, she is actually deformed, with male genitalia clearly visible (commonly known as a hermaphrodite), causing the other female prisoners in the same cell to be afraid to share a room with her. They requested instructions on how to handle the situation. Upon receiving the report, the county government immediately made arrangements to guard her separately.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Complete Reorganization of the Anti-Japanese Association The various Anti-Japanese National Salvation Associations were initially jointly organized by representatives from various groups, but were later controlled by a small number of people, leading to unhealthy work practices and extreme corruption. After a joint meeting of the various district Anti-Japanese Associations, it was decided to send a letter requiring that the accounts be published within three days and that the fines paid by various businesses be investigated for verification. The County Anti-Japanese Association also found its work difficult, and all the committee members submitted their resignations to the County Party Headquarters yesterday. The County Party Headquarters approved this, immediately sending personnel to take over and ordering various groups to re-nominate representatives in accordance with the organizational methods promulgated by the province for a complete reorganization. In addition, the registration fees of four percent paid by various industries totaled over 4,280 yuan, which was also decided to be allocated as follows: over 1,700 yuan to the Volunteer Army, over 850 yuan to the Social Boy Scouts, and over 1,700 yuan remaining, to be deposited in the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for handover.</p>
<p>The County Executive Committee Continues to Work The County Executive Committee issued a notice yesterday, stating that the committee's work had never been interrupted. The emergence of the so-called Party Affairs Improvement Association had caused outsiders to misunderstand the situation, not knowing the underlying reasons. The notice stated that changes in Party affairs must be determined by the central government's improvement policy before the committee could dare to abandon its responsibilities without being formally reorganized by the provincial committee. The notice was issued in a solemn announcement, and the 43rd committee meeting was convened, with the following agenda: (1) Supporting the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee; (2) Expressing a welcome to the Guangdong committee members traveling to Beijing; (3) Supporting Mr. Wang Jingwei's early arrival in Beijing to preside over the affairs of the Party and the country; (4) Committee members of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association resigning; =, ordering various groups to re-nominate representatives for a complete reorganization; (5) Scheduling an emergency meeting of all executive committee members from all districts and branches in the county on the 21st of this month to discuss the promotion of Party affairs; (6) Some party members in the county initiated the organization of a Party Affairs Improvement Association, and the committee should telegraph the Provincial Party Headquarters for verification.

Unexpectedly, when they reached the Luoluo area of Kuangqiao, a black awning boat appeared, and three burly men jumped out and blocked their path. Seeing this, Qian and his servant resisted the bandits, but they were outnumbered. As a result, Qian and his farmhand were both kidnapped onto the bandits' boat, which sped away. Yesterday, the incident was reported to the local Public Security Bureau and the Commercial Corps for investigation.</p>

<p>Rickshaw Operators Oppose the Construction Bureau's Harsh Levies The Construction Bureau, due to the collapse of roads in the urban area, estimated the cost of repairs to be quite high. It planned to charge a registration fee of five yuan per rickshaw to fund the work. More than twenty rickshaw companies, using a monthly contribution of one yuan and three cents per vehicle based on 200 vehicles (80 vehicles added this year are not yet included), would contribute 260 yuan per month. This was a road maintenance fee, calculated from September of the 18th year to the present, a total of twenty-eight months. They are very unwilling to pay the registration fee, since it adds up to a substantial amount of 7,280 yuan. They presented their case to both the Party and the government, requesting that the Construction Bureau settle the accounts for road maintenance.</p>

They immediately barged in, capturing Chen A'da, a Taizhou native guarding the hostage, as well as Zhu Zhushi, the sister of Zhu A'er. They also found Chen Jikang (12 years old), the son of Chen Lida, a farmer from Yuxian Township, in a secret room. He had been kidnapped on the seventh day of the eighth lunar month while returning home from Yuxian Primary School. Because his family was poor and unable to pay the ransom, they took the group of people back to the First Squad Headquarters. Later, the Nanyan Police Station arrested Shangshi, the mother of Zhu A'er. The squad also arrested Chen Ruan, the wife of the bandit leader Chen, in Juren Lane in front of the Xuanmiao Temple.

<h3>Special Feature: The Three Principles of the People and University Education (Cont. 2) - Zheng Hongnian</h3>
<p>(C) Vocational Training and Construction</p>
<p>The primary task of construction is to address the people's livelihood, the four basic necessities of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Even the most trivial aspects require the application of scientific methods. Therefore, university students must emphasize practical science, and schools should enrich their curriculum and focus on vocational training. The goal is to cultivate specialized talent with knowledge and skills to serve the nation and society. Currently, the nation is in crisis. University students are rallying and striving to be leaders of society and the people. Their passionate enthusiasm is truly commendable. However, Mr. Hu Hanmin said, "Do not merely vent your emotions, but cultivate your strength." The conflict between China and Japan cannot be resolved overnight. In the past, Denmark was defeated by Germany, ceded territory, and paid indemnities. The nation's strength was depleted, and it was on the verge of collapse. The people's hearts were scattered, their spirits were low, and industry and commerce were underdeveloped. Its situation was arguably worse than China's today. However, thanks to the efforts and leadership of the educator Grundtvig, the nation was revived. Denmark was primarily an agricultural country, and Grundtvig established a folk high school in the countryside. All young people aged eighteen to thirty received this education, which developed agriculture and increased the nation's wealth. He also promoted agricultural cooperation to stabilize society and eliminate labor-management disputes. In less than fifty years, Denmark became one of the most stable and prosperous nations in the world. China's production is backward, its science is underdeveloped, and it faces internal and external troubles. The lessons of history are not far off. It is hoped that outstanding young people receiving higher education will thoroughly engage in scientific research, receive vocational training, build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, complete the National Revolution, and promote universal harmony.</p>
<p>4. Conclusion</p>
<p>The degree of world evolution always depends on the speed of academic competition. Since the Three Principles of the People contain all academic disciplines, the development of academics can reveal the progress of the Three Principles of the People's construction. The development of science has varying speeds, which means that the construction of the Three Principles of the People also has priorities. As the saying goes, "Things have roots and branches, and events have beginnings and ends. Knowing what comes first and what comes last is the path to understanding." "The way of great learning consists in manifesting clear virtue, renovating the people, and resting in the highest excellence." Achieving the realm of ultimate goodness creates a center of social ethics. Confucius once lamented, "I have not been able to see a good person. If I could see someone with perseverance, that would be acceptable. To lack and pretend to have, to be empty and pretend to be full, to be constrained and pretend to be grand – it is difficult to have perseverance. Perseverance is the gateway to virtue." This shows that achieving virtue always begins with perseverance. He listed three examples of vain boasting to warn those who cannot maintain constancy. He also said, "If a good person governs a state for a hundred years, they can overcome cruelty and eliminate killing." Alas, the world is now in turmoil, with endless cruelty and killing. Where can we find a good person to govern the state and save the people from suffering? The purpose of university education is to create a center of social ethics that rests in ultimate goodness. University education under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People aims to cultivate virtuous individuals who can govern the state for a hundred years (End).</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>No Confucius Shrine Can Be Set Up in Schools</h3>
<p>▲Reply from the Ministries of Interior and Education to the Central Committee</p>
<p>The Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee previously sent a letter to the Ministries of Interior and Education, stating that the Standing Committee had forwarded a report from the Hunan Provincial Party Guidance Committee regarding a request from the Chen County Executive Committee to confirm the status of hanging Sun Yat-sen's portrait and posting Confucius' shrine in schools. It was approved that the matter concerned education and etiquette and should be submitted to the Ministries of Education and Interior for proper verification and reply. The Ministries of Interior and Education have now jointly replied to the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee with the results of their discussion of the case, stating that they had approved the public letter from your office regarding the approved forwarding of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee's request to confirm the hanging of Sun Yat-sen's portrait and the posting of Confucius' shrine in schools. They are specially sending this letter to inform you of the verification and reply, along with a copy of the original report. They have found that there is no legal basis for posting Confucius' shrine in schools. If Confucius is considered a religious leader, it would violate the legal provision that "no religious ceremonies may be held in schools." Even for Confucius' birthday commemoration, there is no need to set up a Confucius shrine in schools. The reply is being sent as requested. Please inform your office to verify and report. Furthermore, this case was drafted by the Ministry of Education, which also makes this statement.</p>
<h3>He Jian Convenes School Principals for Talks</h3>
<p>▲Hoping to Broaden Their Vision to the "Question of China's Survival"</p>
<p>(Changsha Correspondence) He Jian has returned from Nanjing and Shanghai, believing that the student patriotic movement is extremely important. He believes that most Chinese people are spiritually dead, but young students are still energetic. However, he fears that their objectives are unclear, their steps are not unified, and they are easily exploited by others. Therefore, on the 16th of this month, he convened principals, deans of discipline, deans of academics, and directors of military training from secondary schools and above throughout the province to the provincial government for talks. Xie Zuyou, Zhu Haohuai, and Huang Jiasheng from the Provincial Party Committee; Cao Dianqiu, a member of the Provincial Government; Cao Bowen, Zhang Kailian, Huang Shiheng, and Tan Changkai, the directors of the four departments of civil affairs, finance, education, and construction; Chen Changzu, the president of the High Court; and Yao Xuehuai, Huang Baoxuan, and Huang Ji from the Municipal Party Committee, totaling over a hundred people, attended. After refreshments, He Jian stood up to give a long speech. The main points were: first, he described the recent situation in various parts of the country; second, he described the recent conspiracy of the Red bandits to harm the Party and the country during the national crisis. Therefore, while advocating for resistance against Japan and national salvation, it is also necessary to pay attention to suppressing the Reds. He then mentioned that the Hunan education community's past leadership of the patriotic movement of young people was very orderly and praised by people everywhere. He said that young people are the backbone of the national salvation movement, and he hoped that the education community would broaden their vision to the "question of China's survival" and lead young people to truly save the country. He also listed the points that teachers should pay attention to regarding students and the responsibilities they should bear towards the country, society, students' parents, and the students themselves. He explained in great detail. Finally, he explained his sincerity in wanting to improve Hunan and hoped that all sectors of the Party, government, military, and academia would unite to overcome the national crisis. Tan Changkai from the Provincial Party Committee, Zhang Kailian from the Finance Department, Yao Xuehuai and Huang Baoxuan from the Municipal Party Committee, and Cao Mu from the Military Training Department of Hunan University also spoke, mostly expressing their hope that from now on, everyone would unite to save Hunan and save China.</p>
<h3>A Letter to All Sectors from Professors of the College of Engineering, Zhejiang University</h3>
<p>▲Regarding the Demonstration Movement by Students from Various Schools in Hangzhou on December 10th</p>
<p>A Letter to All Sectors from All Professors of the College of Engineering, National Zhejiang University:</p>
<p>We have been hired to fill these positions and hope to contribute our humble knowledge to assist students in studying and researching science to save China, which is lagging behind in science. Since taking office, we have been busy day and night, immersed in lecturing, experiments, reference materials, and research. Fortunately, the students are diligent in their studies, and their scientific knowledge has gradually increased. The College of Engineering of Zhejiang University has a good reputation in society. We hope to continue this progress and join the ranks of renowned universities around the world. However, since the September 18th Incident, when the violent Japanese invaded, the students, filled with righteous indignation, organized an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and formed a Student Volunteer Army to carry out their patriotic movement. This is the natural duty of a citizen, and we deeply support it. We have all participated in the organization of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and the training of the Volunteer Army. Later, when the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters established the Hangzhou City Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association, our college also joined as a member. At that time, the inspectors of Japanese goods hired by the United Association often failed to fulfill their responsibilities. Students from various schools were repeatedly called upon to inspect in groups. Our students worked tirelessly, braving wind and rain, taking turns to go out, and performing their duties conscientiously, which was highly valued by the Party Headquarters. As a result, they received written and verbal orders to mobilize most of our students to be responsible for searching Gao Yitai's private collection of Japanese goods. The students followed the locations listed in the written order and were led by a special envoy. They successfully seized a large amount of Japanese goods and, fearing that they would be secretly moved, guarded them overnight, without food or drink, in order to thoroughly handle the matter and deter others. Later, the United Association delayed the case for many days and eventually settled it vaguely with a fine of 6,000 yuan. The College of Engineering students could not understand the Party Headquarters' excuses to various parties and suspected the corruption of the United Association's personnel. They also believed that students joined the United Association not to help it but to be exploited by it as a tool. They gradually lost faith in the Party Headquarters. When students from various schools in Hangzhou planned to form another Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association, the College of Engineering students also joined and planned to join the various sectors Anti-Japanese United Association in the name of the Student Federation Anti-Japanese Association, following the example of Shanghai and Nanjing. However, the Party Headquarters did not recognize this organization and issued a notice through the Education Department to ban it, leading to the December 10th demonstration. They petitioned the Provincial Party Headquarters unsuccessfully, resulting in the beating of committee members, the smashing of objects, and a petition to the Education Department, which refused to meet with them, leading to damage to Director Zhang's private residence and belongings. We were unable to prevent this unexpected action beforehand, and we will share the responsibility for failing to educate them properly. However, the Provincial Party Headquarters issued a statement after the event, suspecting that President Li Zhenwu had condoned it and blaming it on the College of Engineering, as if the students from other schools were all coerced and deceived by the College of Engineering. This false propaganda is far from the truth and clearly serves another purpose. Recently, we also received a joint letter from the printing, transportation, and pharmaceutical workers' unions, claiming that the College of Engineering students were cutting off their livelihoods. Today, the various workers' unions have issued statements denying this, which shows that someone is fabricating facts with the intention of sabotage. We do not need to argue further. However, we cannot help but speak about the students' Anti-Japanese National Salvation and the organization of the Volunteer Army, which came from a sincere and patriotic mentality, open and selfless. The Party Headquarters' emphasis on the College of Engineering students and their assignment of the important task of searching Gao Yitai was also purely based on a serious and selfless mentality. At that time, the Hangzhou Minguo Daily repeatedly praised the College of Engineering students and encouraged them in every possible way. However, the College of Engineering students lost faith in the Party Headquarters due to the superficial handling of the Gao case, which led to this unfortunate incident. They took actions that harmed order out of a love for the country, which we deeply regret. The Provincial Party Headquarters praised the College of Engineering students before but now focuses on attacking the College of Engineering and blaming it on one school. The attitude is completely different, and we cannot understand the intention. We hold teaching positions at the college and are responsible for guiding and advising students. However, according to current laws and regulations, all mass organizations are guided by the Party Headquarters. Therefore, since the outbreak of this Anti-Japanese movement, we have only joined in our individual capacity and have fully trusted the Party Headquarters in guiding the students' actions, without expressing any opinions to avoid misunderstandings. Now that this unfortunate incident has occurred, we believe that while the students' actions may have exceeded the boundaries, the Party Headquarters also failed to fully fulfill its guiding responsibilities. At this time of national crisis, we dare not lag behind in our love for the country. We sincerely hope that both sides will repent for their past mistakes and work to make amends, moving towards the path of resisting Japan and saving the nation, rather than using divisive tactics to cause greater disputes. Furthermore, the College of Engineering has been established for over twenty years, and its graduates have served in all sectors, numbering thousands. The achievements of the school are well known to society. All teachers and students of the school are extremely protective of their alma mater and will fight with all their strength against any external sabotage. We respectfully ask for your understanding. Respectfully submitted by all professors of the College of Engineering, National Zhejiang University, December 15th, 1931.</p>
<h3>Telegram to the Central Government from Professors of Hunan University</h3>
<p>Telegram to the Central Government from Qian Weizong and others, professors of Hunan University: To Chairman Chiang, presented by Committee Member Shao Lizi, Hubu Street, Nanjing. China today can only defend after it can fight, and can only negotiate after it can defend. Fighting must be used as a means, and defense as the goal. Even if we lack the strength to fight, we must stand firm. We respectfully request that you issue a conscription order immediately and set a deadline for repairing coastal and river fortresses and batteries. In terms of strategy, commercial warfare is superior to military warfare. We also request that you issue a clear order to restrict the export of Japanese grain and raw materials and actively promote the establishment of domestic goods factories. The urgent telegram cannot wait. We are awaiting orders. Respectfully submitted by Wu Depei and Qian Weizong, professors of Hunan University.</p>

<h3>Pan Gongzhan Resigns as Vice-President of China Public School</h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, the vice-president of China Public School, yesterday telegraphed Cai Yuanpei, the chairman of the board of directors, requesting permission to resign and announced in the newspaper that he would no longer be responsible. The announcement is excerpted below: In the spring of this year, Gongzhan was appointed as a director of China Public School. In early autumn, due to Mr. Zhu Jingnong's departure from Shanghai, the board of directors appointed Gongzhan as vice-president. The task was heavy, and he declined repeatedly, but he was unable to refuse. He believed that education was of utmost importance, and China Public School was a school with a history. At that time, President Shao happened to be traveling far away, and he could not bear to see it without a leader. Even with his busy schedule, he had to reluctantly take on the task to maintain the temporary situation. However, since the September 18th Incident, the whole country has been indignant. Gongzhan also guided students to organize groups and engage in Anti-Japanese National Salvation work. However, the student population is unusually complex. Recently, there have been disputes over the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Executive Committee, resulting in mutual beatings. As a result, there have been more absurd actions, such as supporting or rejecting certain individuals. National hatred has not been resisted, but fellow students are fighting each other. His guidance was ineffective, and he was extremely heartbroken. He immediately telegraphed Chairman Cai and President Shao, requesting permission to resign from the position of vice-president and to convene a board of directors meeting as soon as possible to discuss everything. In the meantime, he has temporarily handed over the school affairs to Dean Fan to handle jointly with the three presidents, Xie, Liu, and Ying, under the instructions of President Shao. This special announcement declares that he will no longer be responsible for the school affairs of China Public School from the date of this announcement. We hope you will take note of this announcement. December 20th, 1931.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Girls' Middle School to Resume Classes Tomorrow</h3>
<p>After the strike at Shanghai Girls' Middle School in Ximen, the teachers took turns lecturing on Japanese research issues, and they stepped up military training and lectured on nursing knowledge. Teachers Xu Wancheng, Qu Shizhen, Chen Yisheng, Zhou Dingxin, and others, as well as students and family heads, will resume classes on Monday (21st) tomorrow. Principal Wu Ziqian has already issued a notice deciding to resume classes tomorrow. Teacher Xu and others have often taught students, saying, "In the past, during the European War, Germany suffered a major defeat, but the sound of singing and music never stopped, because education is the foundation of a country. Moreover, the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee is about to open, and the situation seems to have a turning point. All of us students, in addition to studying, should adhere to the responsibility of supervising the government. If the government is still numb and insensitive, strikes and demonstrations will not solve the problem. The people must deal with it with effective methods." The words were very enthusiastic and poignant. It is reported that a small number of four or five students in the school still advocate for a strike, while the rest agree to resume classes.</p>
<h3>Educator from Xiamen Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>New Executive Committee of the Chinese Agronomy Society</h3>
<p>The Chinese Agronomy Society has been in Beijing for nearly two years since it moved from Shanghai in January 1910.

Some have been realized, and some are being planned and implemented. All of this is a new initiative of the society after moving to Beijing. Recently, it was learned that the election of the executive committee of the society for the year 1932 has been completed by correspondence from all members. As a result of the vote count, Xu Xuan, Chen Rong, Liang Xi, Zeng Jikuan, Shen Zonghan, Tang Huisun, Qian Tianhe, Dong Shijian, Wang Shanjian, and Sun Enjun, ten people with the most votes, were elected as executive committee members, together with the nine incumbent executive committee members Chen Fangji, Lu Feiyi, Zou Bingwen, Wu Juenong, Huang Kutong, Hu Changchi, Tang Qiyu, Liu Yunchou, and Tang Changzhi, totaling nineteen people, to be the new executive committee of the society for the coming year to carry out the society's affairs.</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts on the Dark Horse</h3>
<p>— Meng Die</p>
<p>Previously, this column saw Dong Jun using "dark horse" as a subtle antithesis. Wanting to praise General Zhan Shanyuan, Jiang Jun then used the words "red sheep" to pair it, which was very clever and apt. I think that the words "yellow dragon" can also be used to pair it, and "Directly attack the Yellow Dragon" is a heroic saying of Yue Wumu (Yue Fei), and also refers to northern affairs. Now that the violent sun is invading, the military men are as timid as rats, falling at the first sight. Only General Zhan Shan Yuan alone displays heroic might, fighting the many with the few, and repeatedly winning battles. Our country today is as weak as the Southern Song Dynasty, and the general's loyalty and bravery are reminiscent of Yue Wumu. Alas, a withered fruit, a lone star after dawn, a rooster crowing in the wind and rain, a crane in the vast sky. I regret that there are too few General Ma! Indeed, he is rare and valuable. Therefore, I use the words "dark horse, yellow ridge" to create a couplet to praise him: "Guarding the territory, demonstrating unwavering loyalty, the whole country admires the dark horse. Revenging and extending great ambitions, in the future, directly attack the Yellow Dragon." The general's talent is not only enough to defend himself. If the words "dark horse" are only used for literal antithesis, then any colored animal will do, which is an insentient antithesis, and the meaning is lost far away.</p>
<p>Don't Remove the Weeds in the Courtyard, Random Talks by Zhai Fu</p>
<h3>Hold On</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>"Let's go buy some firecrackers to set off for a good time!"</p>
<p>"Why are you so happy?"</p>
<p>"Jiang is out of office, peaceful unification, Guangzhou is parading and setting off firecrackers, can't we also set off some firecrackers to celebrate?"</p>
<p>"Hold on a bit with the happiness! Our firecrackers still have to be kept for some time before they can be set off."</p>
<p>"What day do we have to keep the firecrackers until we can make peace!"</p>
<p>"When the disaster-stricken compatriots have enough food and clothing, the lost territories of the eastern provinces are completely restored, the people of the whole country truly become the masters of the Republic of China, and all the oppressed people of the world turn over and become free men, then we will be interested in setting off firecrackers to celebrate!"</p>
<h3>Biographies of Generals Zhang and Nie</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Since the Japanese invaders have encroached upon our China, the people of the country are filled with righteous indignation, and there is a great momentum of feeding the horses and sharpening the weapons, determined to fight to the death. And we, the scribes, are searching through old papers and books to praise the famous generals who annihilated the Japanese in the past, as a contribution to discussion. This boosts morale, killing two birds with one stone. Who says it is not appropriate? The Generals Zhang and Nie that I am writing about are rising stars of the Huai Army. Zhang's name is Gao Yuan, and Nie's name is Shicheng. Both demonstrated military prowess and made achievements in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, which cannot be buried. Zhang is known for his courage and strategy. In battle, he often led the soldiers on horseback, disregarding the flying bullets as if they were nothing. People called him Zhang Yuzi. Zhang also used this as his pseudonym. When Lushun was lost, Zhang was ordered by Li Hefei to assist. At that time, Zhang commanded eight battalions of the Guangwu, Songwu, and newly recruited Fu troops, known for their strength. However, Lushun had already fallen before he could set out. Therefore, he followed the imperial decree to join Song Qing in defending Qianma Ridge. When the Japanese army attacked, Zhang fought with them, killing thousands of enemies. The Japanese army was defeated and withdrew. Afterwards, Song Qing summoned Zhang to discuss military affairs. Zhang asked to attack the enemy together. Song was jealous of Zhang's outstanding performance and greater prestige than his own, as a defeated general. He refused, threatening him with danger. Zhang said with emotion, "Zhang Yuzi is not a weak insect. I would rather die in battle. Danger is not to be feared." Therefore, Song became more wary of him and ordered him to move his troops to defend Gaiping. Zhang knew that Gaiping was a dangerous place with no defenses. Song's action was to trap him. However, the military order could not be violated, so he followed it. Before long, tens of thousands of Japanese troops attacked. Zhang remained calm, waiting for the enemy to get close before firing a volley of bullets, killing three Japanese generals. Zhang knew that the Japanese army would launch a large-scale siege and asked Song for reinforcements. Song did not respond. The next day, the Japanese army surged in like a tide, with bullets like dense rain and fog obscuring the view. He sent another messenger to ask Song for assistance. Song was stationed in Ximu City but remained motionless. Zhang was isolated and fought hard day and night, exhausted and out of ammunition. Then, he used blades to attack. The Japanese army's corpses were scattered all over the field. In the end, he was outnumbered and lost his commanders Li Shihong, Li Rendang, Yang Shoushan, Zhang Shibao, and Jia Junlian. Zhang had no choice but to lead the remaining soldiers out of the encirclement and retreated to Yingkou. When the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed, Zhang retired to his hometown. Nie Shicheng was a subordinate of Ye Zhichao. In the Battle of Asan, Ye's army was defeated, and Nie was implicated. They retreated together, and Ye was punished. Nie then led a small force of a thousand men to defend Motian Ridge, protecting Shengjing. The Japanese army repeatedly attacked, but they were all driven away. Shengjing was preserved thanks to Nie's efforts.</p>
<h3>The Same Wind and Snow, People in Two Different Places</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>A foreign-style building in Shanghai. The room is equipped with hot water radiators and an electric stove. The air is very warm. The owner is wearing a fox fur coat, embracing his beloved wife, drinking warm wine, and eating hot pot, while enjoying the snowflakes dancing outside the glass window. The owner is very interested in this cold and snowy weather.</p>
<p>A lonely camp outside the Great Wall. A biting cold wind blows into the camp from time to time. Water freezes into ice. The air is very bleak. The soldiers are wearing thin clothes, holding iron guns, enduring hunger, and shivering. They are vigilantly guarding against the enemy's ruthless bullets. The soldiers feel immense pain in this cold and snowy weather.</p>
<p>The same compatriots, why are the rich people sitting comfortably in Shanghai enjoying themselves, while the soldiers fighting the enemy outside the Great Wall are suffering so much? The same wind and snow, why does it bring joy to the eyes of the rich in Shanghai, but pain to the eyes of the soldiers resisting the enemy outside the Great Wall?</p>
<p>In the cold and snowy weather, I had the above doubts and feelings.</p>
<p>Also, during the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year, the Eight-Nation Alliance arrived. On May 18, Dagu fell. Nie's vanguard was stationed at Zizhulin. The Japanese army arrived first, and Nie defeated them in one fell swoop, causing many deaths. The allied forces of other countries continued to advance. Nie fought hard, acting as one against a hundred. The allied forces knew that Nie was not easy to defeat, so they attacked him with green gas cannons. Nie died very tragically. Noble and outstanding generals, Zhang and Nie can be considered worthy of the title.</p>
<h3>Mourning the Late Xu Zhimo</h3>
<p>— Wu Tianfang</p>
<p>I returned to Shanghai from a mountain tour in Fenghua and saw in the newspaper that Zhimo had died tragically in a plane crash in Jinan. I was saddened all day. Gu Hongye, a literature professor at Jinan University, used to live in Liulimen, the old capital. One day, the host arranged a banquet. Among the guests were Zhimo and I. In the middle of the meal, Zhimo raised his glass to me and said, "Drink with the King of Balls as much as you can." Everyone present did not know who he was referring to. Alas, Zhimo was indeed my old friend. Sixteen or seventeen years ago, I was studying at Wulin Anding. Every time there was a soccer match, I always played center forward. At that time, Zhimo was a top student at Yizhong, coming to watch. Sometimes, he would participate in the game, rushing forward powerfully. This is how we became acquainted. The past is like dust. Now, we have not been friends for a long time, and I don't even remember talking about it. But Zhimo alone could mention it. Although I humbly declined, it cannot be said that he was not my old friend. For more than ten years, we have been busy with our own affairs and have not been in touch. Occasionally, we would meet on the road, wave to each other, and then pass by like wind and clouds. In the 17th year of the Republic, I traveled to Pengcheng and received a message from He Junjingwu, informing me of Zhimo's whereabouts. However, I never had the chance to meet him. I always remember his outstanding literary talent and unrestrained personality. When he was a classmate in the preparatory course at Peking University, he was already considered an outstanding figure. Later, he studied abroad, and his brilliance grew daily. Upon his return, he discussed literature with Mr. Ren Gong, Mr. Shizhi, Mr. Zong Meng, and others, and published new poems, creating a unique style. As a result, his reputation was great. His life can be described as truly being "small when placed among great figures, and not feeling great when squeezed among mediocre people," as Mr. Liu Haisu said. If Heaven had granted Zhimo another thirty-six years, his life would have been no more than seventy-two years. Would he have been hated by the world and said to have made no contribution to literature? How could he have died so young and so tragically? I attach a small collection of poems, cut in two, to express my mourning: "Golden hair and white hair fluttered in the wind, I did not see the orchid banner and cinnamon flag. Suddenly, an old friend passed through my heart, a crescent moon fell on the treetops in the long sky. The wind and rain in Wenyang made the six curtains black, the hundred walls of the city were filled with chaotic red. Heaven seemed to say, 'Your mother is in the north,' I heard the weeping south of the Yangtze River."</p>
<p>▲Mourning Zhimo, I have already expressed my grief with a poem and a couplet, but my feelings are not exhausted. I have composed another poem and attached it to a wreath to mourn him. Zhang Xiaoruo</p>
<p>China's poets are unmatched, one flight reports the loss of literature. The joys and sorrows of ice and frost all become dreams, the literary talent and grace are most extraordinary. The fierce tiger gathered together to pass on the unfinished work, creating a grave on the top of the mountain. In recent years, the feelings for the family and the country have been endless, and I cannot bear to hear the wild crying and the mourning of the wild geese.</p>
<p>▲The grief is still not exhausted, and I have composed two more quatrains to mourn the poet. Zhang Xiaoruo</p>
<p>In the cold of late winter, I look to Liaoyang, the moon is black and the sky is low, and the enemy is strong. The whole world is worried about the nest being overturned, how could he die in Zhengjiazhuang.</p>
<p>His fame spread throughout the sea, and his integrity was evident in his sincere friendship. Beyond the sky, the Ganges River and the clouds and trees are pure, and even more heartbreaking is the old poet.</p>
<h3>Christmas Chicken</h3>
<p>— Xiaoyan</p>
<p>According to Western customs, every year on New Year's Day and Christmas Day at the end of the year, every household prepares dishes, especially</p>
<h3>Mr. Gao Junshan Talks About the National Crisis After Returning from Europe and America (3) Ji Ping</h3>
<p>For example, as reported in the newspaper the day before yesterday, the chairman of the Special Committee's resignation contained the passage "... for several decades, world public opinion has been gathering sympathy for our country. International justice is gradually becoming clear. The third resolution of the League of Nations has been established. The diplomatic aspect has come to an end..." It seems that the countries are helping a lot in this Sino-Japanese incident, and our diplomacy is very victorious. It is natural to "come to an end" after losing the three northeastern provinces. If the whole country is lost, it will eventually "come to an end". If the government authorities are so optimistic, how can the people rest assured? Therefore, it is our misfortune, not our strength, that our people pay so much attention to politics.</p>
<p>In recent days, the newspapers have often reported that students have taken actions outside the norm. Generally, people regard this as a hidden worry. In fact, it is inevitable that some people will overstep the bounds due to patriotic movements. However, if one relies on the power of the masses to bully those who cannot resist, such as Wang Fusheng, then one will inevitably betray the original motive of the patriotic movement. Those who break the law should be dealt with according to the law. In today's civilized era, if there are behaviors such as torture as reported in the newspapers, it must be the idea of twenty-odd people. Pure patriotic youths would never take such action. I hope that students will recognize their goals and work towards them, and not be manipulated by a few corrupt elements, which would completely undo the efforts of the past few months.</p>
<p>Some people say that the League of Nations is a loot-sharing organization of the five major powers. It can be said that they are right. In principle, the League of Nations does not talk about "equality". This time, our country has suffered such great oppression and humiliation from Japan. We have no preparation and do not resist. We only dream of relying on the League of Nations to mediate. This is a fundamental mistake. We can understand the inequality and unreliability of the League of Nations itself with a very simple view.</p>
<p>(1) The League of Nations was born based on the Treaty of Versailles. This is a treaty of the victorious countries after the European War. In other words, it is a treaty that accommodates the powerful countries. Therefore, if a dispute occurs between a powerful country and a weak country, and a judgment is requested, the powerful country will definitely take advantage.</p>
<p>(2) According to the provisions of the Covenant, a resolution must be unanimously agreed upon before it can be passed. This method is specifically for the convenience of the powerful countries. Because of this provision, the powerful countries can go their own way without regard to public opinion. It is impossible to ask about their intentions when the Covenant was drafted. In this Sino-Japanese incident, Japan cast a dissenting vote, rendering the thirteen votes of the other countries ineffective. This is why we are suffering from this Covenant. If a weak country has any unique claims, it can only succumb to violence. There would be no hope of realization.</p>
<p>(3) The five permanent seats on the Council of the League of Nations are represented by the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, and Italy. The remaining nine non-permanent seats are selected by the member states. It is clear that the League of Nations is controlled by the powerful.</p>
<p>Christmas Chicken</p>
<p>Christmas chicken, the Western name is turkey, commonly known as huoji (fire chicken), also known as qimianji (seven-faced chicken). Because the chicken's head is a mixture of red and blue, hideous and terrifying, it is also called Bailuji (White Dew Chicken). It is only gradually available on the market after the White Dew Festival. It is also called Tusouji (Spit Silk Chicken). The feathers of the chicken's body sometimes have a tail like a peacock's, like a brocade ribbon. Because its name is the same as "Turkey", it is also called Turkey Chicken. Recently, as Christmas Day and New Year's Day approach, this chicken has become a valuable commodity in Western industries. Dinghai in Zhejiang, that is, the Zhoushan Islands in the geographical record. In addition to fishing and farming, the islanders also raise this chicken. From hatching in the spring until the beginning of winter, the chicken has grown up. Male chickens are more valuable. The weight of a large one is always around 20 to 30 pounds. Transported to the sea, it is sold to Western restaurants. Each pound costs four or five dimes. The owner of the Family Restaurant at 296 Jing'an Temple Road, He Zhaoyu, is from Dinghai, so he transports fire chickens from his hometown to Shanghai himself. Those who like Western food must go to the Family Restaurant to eat fire chicken. This is also one of the common knowledge of eating in Shanghai. However, Europeans, except for New Year's Day and Christmas Day at the end of the year, do not have fire chicken unless they are entertaining distinguished guests. Only on Christmas Day, because every household must prepare this dish, it is also called Christmas Chicken.</p>
<p>The taste of fire chicken is slightly different from that of Chinese chicken. Chicken taste has no oily smell. Chicken meat is also more loose, dry, and delicious than Chinese chicken. The taste of roasted chicken is even better than that of roasted duck. When Europeans hire a chef, they always ask if they can roast fire chicken, which is regarded as a standard for employment. This also shows the importance Europeans attach to fire chicken.</p>

<h3>Sharing the Same Hatred With You (17)</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Killing Relatives for Justice</p>
<p>Zhongshu lowered her head, seemingly deep in thought. The room was as quiet as if no one was there. Only the sounds of distant military bugles could be heard, wailing and sobbing, very desolate. After a long time, Zhongshu raised her head and said to Hua Naiqiang, "That's right. A person can only bravely choose one path to take, and cannot walk two paths at the same time. Weighing the pros and cons, I agree to follow your words." When Naiqiang heard her answer these few words, a look of surprise and joy appeared on his face. He bent over and bowed deeply to Zhongshu, very respectfully.</p>
<p>The next morning, the wind in T City picked up urgently. Peng Meiguo had ordered the troops in the capital to set off immediately to attack H Province. At the same time, a dozen or so officers from the Sun Country rushed to assist. It was said that dozens of cannons had been transported. The general populace was frightened. Although they did not approve of Peng Meiguo's treasonous actions, they could not do anything about him with their bare hands. Peng Meiguo, along with his chief of staff and several Sun Country officers, was about to set off when he suddenly caught sight of his daughter Zhongshu. She had already changed into a military uniform, wearing a military cap, and carrying a box cannon at her waist. She walked in from outside, looking like a young military officer, and said to Gu Meiguo, "Father is going to war, and I want to go with you. Let me gain some experience on the battlefield, and I can also protect Father." Peng Meiguo couldn't help but smile and said, "In ancient times there was Hua Mulan, and now there is Peng Zhongshu. It is truly a rare coincidence. Since you are willing to go, I will take you with me. Just don't be afraid of the sound of gunfire." Zhongshu said, "Father, don't underestimate your daughter. If I were afraid, I wouldn't have come to ask." The people around saw that the chief general's daughter was also joining the army, and they praised her as a female hero. Zhongshu saw that her father had agreed, and then said, "My classmate Hua Jun is here, and he also wants to set off together." Peng Meiguo nodded and said, "It's good for him to go for a walk." Then he saw a young man in military uniform walking in from outside, giving Peng Meiguo a military salute and standing aside. Peng Meiguo said, "Hua Jun, if you want to go with me, you must work hard with me. You must know that I am not relying on foreign forces to deceive my compatriots. It is really because China is in extreme internal turmoil. A group of young men are fighting for power and profit, regardless of national affairs. I have been in office for a long time, and although I have no great achievements, I sit idly by and watch those young men rise to prominence, making the people suffer even more. Therefore, I am sending troops this time to recover H Province and quell the internal turmoil, for the sake of saving the country and protecting the people. You should know this." Hua Naiqiang agreed with a "yes" word. In his heart, he was extremely angry, cursing the old thief. You are clearly harming the country and the people, and you still say you are saving the country and protecting the people. Where is your sense of shame? Peng Meiguo then ordered the two to follow him closely. He immediately took the train and set off, heading for H Province.</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Standard Softens</h3>
<p>▲Continued to Drop by Five Taels and Two Qian, the Gold Standard Seems to Be in a Softening State of Low Consolidation, with Considerable Fluctuations, Momentarily Fluctuating by Ten Taels. As a Result, it Continued to Fall by Five Taels. Sellers Were Agile, and Transactions by Various Firms Were Not Large. The Opening Was High, Probably Due to the Silver Market Reporting a Decline. Afterwards, Due to Rumors that Canada Was About to Prohibit the Outflow of Cash, and Foreign Exchange Increased the English Gold by Two Levels, Only the American Gold Rebounded. This Was Actually Due to the Decline in Both British and American Exchange Rates. As a Result, the Gold Market Suddenly Showed a Weak Trend, Breaking into 660 Taels. Then, Due to the Improvement in Exchange Rates, Foreign Firms Constantly Settled, Suddenly Reaching the Upper Level, Stimulating a Rise of Ten Taels. However, the Bank's Buying Appetite Was Ordinary, and the Forward Price Exceeded 34 Yuan. As a Result, it Was Only Between 60 Taels. Because the Market Was Closed on Saturday, It Was Found That the Situation in the Week Was Complex. Because the Swap Spread Was More Than 40 Taels, the Minimum Price (January) Was 39 Taels and a Half, and the Maximum Price (February) Was 74 Taels and a Half. Overall, Adding 10 Taels, the Swap Rose Slightly by About Two Taels.</p>
<p>▲Fluctuations Occurred from Time to Time. Since the Early Opening, it Rose by Two Taels to 669 Taels. The Big Bar Silver Fell Back by One Sixteenth, and the Forward Price by One Quarter. The Silver Price Fell by Seven Eighths. However, European Short-Term English Silver Was Stronger, So People's Hearts Turned Down and Fell by Four or Five Taels. Moreover, Hengyu, Richang, Goods and Other Sellers' Intentions Did Not Wane, So it Fell to 63 Taels and 5 Qian. In an Instant, Xing Yongfeng and Others Advanced Slightly, and the American Gold Was Still Good. The Forward Price of 34 Yuan Could Be Sold. The Next Month's Futures Were Traded by Helan Huabi, Trading March in One, Two, and Five-Month Intervals for 4 Yuan. After More Than Ten Minutes, it Increased to 6 Taels and 6 Qian. Afterwards, Zhifeng, Yong Hengyu, Yongfeng and Others Came to Support, and Feng Bought March at 4 Yuan, One, Two, and Five. Another English Gold Was Imported at 2.01875. This Was a Mumbai Electronic Sale, So the Gold Price Dropped to About 61 Taels. Although English Gold Increased by Half a Penny, the American Gold Decreased Slightly by 1.25. This Was to Offset the Exchange Rate. At This Time, the Gold Price Was 62 Taels and a Half. Helplessly, the Internal Market Was Not Firm. One or Two Months of American Gold Were Traded Against Each Other at 4 Yuan and 25 Qian, and March Was Sold at 1.25. It Immediately Fell to 59 Taels. After 9:40, it Gradually Moved Upwards. Because the British and American Tobacco Company Bought the Current English Gold at 1.875, and March at 1.25, the Market Suddenly Tightened. And Yu Da, Cuichang, Yongfuchang, Tong Taichang, Yifengyong and Others Chased After it. Datong Entered March at 34 Yuan, So the Gold Price Rose Sharply, Reaching 69 Taels and 5 Qian at 10:30. This Three-Quarter Hour Accounted for Two Taels of Capital. After Entering, Zhifeng, Yongyifeng, Yongfeng, Shunli, and Others Tried Hard to Sell. Another Forward English Gold Was Bought by the Bank at 1.25, and HSBC Sold American Gold at 4 Yuan and 0.625, So the Price Plunged Nine Taels, Reaching 60 Taels and a Half at 11:20. At This Time, Neixing, Yuanmao Yong and Retail Investors Bought in, Pulling Up More Than Three Taels. At 11:30, it Was Three Taels and Nine Qian, But the Exchange Rate Was Still Loose. Moreover, Dadecheng, Yuanheng, Hengyu, Yuanmao Yong, and Others Sold Enthusiastically, Dropping Three Taels Immediately. At Noon, it Was 61 Taels. It Then Closed at 61 Taels and 8 Qian, Falling Another Five Taels and Two Qian Compared to the Day Before. Yifengyong Advanced Slightly, Continuing to Raise to Three Taels. However, Qian Changxiang and Others Suddenly Sold, and Generally, Retail Longs Were Eager to Sell, Falling Three or Four Taels in a Moment. Finally, it Was 58 or 59 Taels. The Market Was Very Confused and Did Not Know What to Do. According to the Maximum of 69 Taels and 5 Qian and the Minimum of 59 Taels in Half a Day, There Were 10 Taels and 5 Qian Twists and Turns. The Goods Opened Early at 70 Taels and Closed at 61 Taels and a Half at Noon. The Posted Price Was Changed to 725 Taels, Calculating Around 60 Taels.

The Hong Kong rate remained unchanged at 75.5 taels. The Indian rupee and Singapore dollar followed the easing trend, while the French franc remained firm.

The gold market trend was weakening, with active selling. It was also rumored that Canada might block cash exports, which was unfavorable for the gold market. Chinese merchants continued to sell gold to cash in silver bars. The total transaction volume of British gold was about tens of thousands of pounds. However, there was a telegram from Bombay selling March contracts. British American Tobacco and Socony and Vacuum, etc. settled some advances. The volume of near and far term U.S. dollar transactions was about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.

<h3>Interest Rates Continue to Weaken</h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview: As the end of the year approaches and business concludes, although the financial settlement period is stipulated to be after the end of January, this year, various banks on the Bund and various businesses that settle accounts according to the Gregorian calendar have mostly completed their settlements. Therefore, although the current trading trend feels weak, the handling procedures are very busy. Regarding market prices, the situation is sluggish, and there is nothing important to record.</p>

Chinese merchants settled only over 1.2 million, foreign merchants settled over 900,000, various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous items were 5.78 million.

<h3>Securities Exchange Abolishes Bond Price Limits</h3>
<p>▲ Agreed upon yesterday and will be implemented soon.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday, many bonds had fallen to the price limit.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions of various bonds on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed that there were many types of spot transactions, and the inflow and outflow were not lonely. However, futures were becoming increasingly weak, and the transaction volume continued to be less than the previous day. For example, the salt tax fell to the lowest price limit in the morning, and the transaction volume became extremely scarce. Other bonds were also not as good as before. As for the price trend, the Sino-Japanese diplomatic situation continued to be quite serious, with plans to attack Jinzhou. The future was very dangerous, and the domestic situation showed little progress. The general sentiment in the market was weaker than before. In addition, the predetermined standard price limit restricted the market, preventing all parties from freely buying and selling. It was also feared that this would lead to further disputes in the future, because when the market price fell to the price limit, the exchange would no longer allow trading. On the brokerage side, those who had previously agreed to sell at the price limit for long-term customers were restricted and would not be able to close out. Therefore, if the prices continued to fall, the future would be a concern and would definitely affect future deliveries. The exchange observed this situation and reported the difficulties to the exchange supervisor, requesting the Ministry of Finance to abolish the price limit in order to stabilize the market. The exchange has now received a letter from the supervisor, allowing the exchange to discuss and find a proper solution. The exchange specially decided last night to abolish the previously set minimum price limit, so that the market can still trade freely without restrictions. This change may boost market sentiment, but yesterday, those who heard of the abolition of the price limit were very cautious. The buying transactions on the market were very cold. Although there was no large-scale selling, sporadic disposal was quite common, which made the market even more depressed. The market price of various bonds continued to fall, and the trend did not weaken slightly. Among them, the salt tax reached the minimum price limit at the beginning of the morning market. Other bonds also fell sharply, but since the initial session, although the prices were still falling, the trend was always very peaceful. As a result, except for the salt tax, which had already fallen close to the price limit the day before, and the 96 customs tax, which also fell by only a few jiao, all others fell by 1 yuan to 1.89 yuan. In addition, spot goods such as post-war military supplies and disaster relief, which had not been traded for many months, suddenly started trading yesterday, and the price drop was also very large. The total spot transactions yesterday were 22,200 yuan, futures were 3.6 million in the morning and over 2.3 million in the afternoon, totaling 5.945 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Stable</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, with no signs of improvement. Due to the many national affairs and the difficulty in easing financial conditions, people's minds are unsettled, and the actual demand is extremely depressed. As the end of the year approaches, various groups have no purchasing power. The market price of fine yarn has recently plummeted because British goods have arrived in Shanghai, and there is a rumor that some goods will be rebranded, so the market has fallen sharply.</p>
<p>▲ The cotton yarn futures market did not fluctuate much. The opening price of cotton yarn futures was up 0.012 yuan for each month due to the rebound in U.S. cotton.

<h3>Cotton Market Slightly Brisk</h3>
<p>The cotton market was slightly firmer due to the rebound in U.S. cotton, which improved sentiment slightly. In addition, many spreads were tightening in the far months, so the overall situation was still tight. However, in reality, there was a lack of good signs.</p>
<p>▲ Hankou Cotton Up a Few Cents. The opening price of Hankou cotton futures was up 0.005 to 0.012 yuan for each month due to the rise in U.S. and Indian cotton. There were fewer sellers in the market. In the afternoon, it rose another 0.005 to 0.01 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 31,500 dan.

<p>▲ Factory Demand Remains Desolate. The spot cotton transactions were sparse.</p>
<h3>U.S. and British Cotton Improve</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially weakened due to pressure from sellers, but then firmed due to strong support from Wall Street and short covering. The futures rose by 15 to 17 points, and the spot rose by 15 points. British cotton futures rose by 9 to 10 points, and the spot rose by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 5 points. Indian cotton firmed due to the weakening exchange rate and short covering. The Pirn rose by 3.75 rupees, Oomra rose by 4 rupees, and Broach rose by 3.5 rupees. The original telegram is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Market Relatively Stable Last Week</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 18th reports on the cotton market for the week: The cotton market was particularly calm last week, with limited price fluctuations. Although the overall trend showed no improvement, sentiment was more resilient. Although stock market fluctuations exerted pressure on raw cotton, they proved ineffective. Later, the South made some hedging sales, but the supply there remained thin. Furthermore, short covering and buying by industry players helped maintain prices. Japan's strict ban on gold exports and the devaluation of the Japanese yen seemed likely to restrict Japan's spot purchases from the South. However, as far as the long-staple cotton they had previously imported was concerned, it seemed sufficient to meet their needs for the entire season. Moreover, they will be suspending the gold standard, which further demonstrates the good position of their textile industry, enabling it to compete with Lancashire in the world.</p>

<h3>Grains: Rice from Hexia Affected by Rain</h3>
<p>▲ Nantou: Yesterday, the source of supplies for various groups was still not abundant, with approximately ten or so ships arriving. The inventory in Pu Cun was thick. The price of thick new japonica rice increased by about 0.10 yuan. Although there were not many high-quality foreign Du rice, the sales were average. The overall trend was fixed, and fluctuations were insignificant.</p>
<p>▲ Xinzha: The source of supplies coming down from Suzhou Creek was not abundant, and there was a slight accumulation in the river. Due to the rainy weather, transactions in this street were scarce. However, the trading houses that were open were only Tongxing, Heyu, Changxiang, and Hengxing, with approximately 2,000 dan. The goods that will be sold tomorrow include two types: Changxi, Xixin, and Nanhang thin rice. The quotations are 0.10 yuan each. The other goods have not yet been traded. Due to the light rain, the goods on the ships have not yet been opened.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Sales Suspended Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the foreign rice market, the purchases by various customer groups were suspended again. However, there were still dealings within the street, so the market was able to stabilize. The Tongshi opened with 300 bags of No. 1 Saigon at a price of 10.08 yuan, and 500 bags of small broken rice at a price of 9.17 yuan. The futures market was also fixed. Foreign firms were also selling. Yesterday, Xiangmao sold 2,000 tons of February small broken rice at a price of 4.27 taels, and Taihe sold 2,000 tons of May small broken rice at a price of 4.6 taels, which were bought by firms in Zhabei and other places. New Taizhou white rice arrived yesterday and 1,000 bags were also traded in this city at a price of 9.65 yuan to 9.23 yuan. The street scene was also stable.</p>
<h3>Near and Far Term Flour Show Good Signs</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market conditions for each month generally turned to a stable and brisk trend. The quotations for foreign wheat rebounded by about 0.04 to 0.06 yuan. In addition, the gold market was not affected by the suspension of exchange and had stabilized. The near-term flour was also quite active due to some purchases by the Nanyang gang. Therefore, both near and far term flour showed good signs. However, because flour factories had ordered two more ships of foreign wheat, they continued to sell off. Under these circumstances, there was little hope for a price increase in the future. As a result, this month was 0.01 yuan better than the previous day, January and February were 0.015 yuan better, March was 0.01 yuan better, April was 0.005 yuan better, and May was 0.0025 yuan better.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Mixed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market conditions for each month generally showed a fluctuating trend. Because today was the last day of the month, the factory's purchases were only twenty or thirty trucks, but there was quite a lot of wheat on the market, so the trend was flat. As for the distant months, since foreign wheat quotations had risen, they should have increased. However, it was rumored that the factories had ordered foreign wheat, one ship of Canadian red wheat with January loading for only 3.63 taels, and one ship of Australian western wheat with April loading for only 3.73 taels. Therefore, sentiment was very flat, and the distant term saw a slight decrease. As a result, this month was down 0.03 yuan from the previous day, January was unchanged, February was up 0.01 yuan, March was down 0.01 yuan, and April and May were down 0.02 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Taikoo Sugar Declines and Rises</h3>
<p>▲ Taikoo Sugar Declines and Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market production area telegrams stated that the price of Cuban raw sugar was 1.09375, a decrease of 0.03125 from the previous telegram. The price of New York sugar futures for December was 1.01, for March next year 1.05, for May 1.2, and for September 1.12, a decrease of 0.03 to 0.05 from the previous prices. The prices of current and forward Java sugar still lacked ups and downs. The association market was planning to increase prices, and the market atmosphere turned strong, with trading quite active. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar for export was raised, and ice sugar factories made slight returns, with a transaction price of 9.475 taels. The market conditions were very brisk. Fine ground granulated white sugar was 9.525 to 9.55 taels, and No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was 9.4 taels, with a firm trend. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 11.65 to 11.75 taels, HX mark was 11.45 to 11.5 taels, and CW mark was 11.55 taels. Trading was still prosperous, and the future prices were all called higher. The Hua Xin Hao sold over 500 bags of CW mark at a price of 11.55 taels. The trade intention was quite strong, and the sale was completed in an instant. The market conditions were all brisk. Looking at the sugar market trend, it seemed that there was still room for a gradual increase.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea and Foreign Firms: Silk Sales Almost Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm silk market in this port almost stagnated. The exchange rate fluctuated, overseas silk reports did not transfer, and general hoarding households, in view of the depression of the European and American silk markets, did not dare to hoard. The market atmosphere was silent. Yesterday, only Samsung purchased 5 bales of small car yellow factory silk, and Mei Da purchased 5 bales of yellow silk, with prices still flat.</p>
<h3>New York Guangdong Silk Falls with Japanese Silk</h3>
<p>▲　　　　　　Style　　　　　　　Gold One Jiao</p>
<p>New York Raw Silk Market, the price of silk from China, Japan, Italy and France has fallen across the board due to the sharp fall in Yokohama Japanese silk. The price of Guangdong new-style white factory silk has always followed the Japanese silk. According to a New York telegram yesterday, the current market price of Guangdong new-style high-quality white factory silk is only 1.8 U.S. dollars per pound, a drop of 0.10 U.S. dollars compared to last week.</p>
<h3>Waterproof American Raincoat Fabric Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Single-sided waterproof American raincoat fabric is the most widely sold, and both Chinese and Western clothing require it. All customer groups purchase it, and all flannel shops sell it. The sales volume increases every year. Recently, the waterproof American raincoat fabric has been falling daily. Since the British exchange rate increased, it has continued to decline. Goods that previously sold for over 5 taels are now reduced to 4.5 taels, and it is still possible to select colors and split bolts after deducting commissions. The main reason is that the increase in the British exchange rate has greatly increased orders, and the cost of goods is lower. It is heard that a large amount will continue to arrive next month.</p>
<h3>Coal: White Coal Dust Sells at High Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, various white coal dusts have been greatly absorbed by various coal briquette factories in this port due to increased uses, resulting in very little circulation of spot goods on the market, and the plate price has therefore risen sharply. Yesterday, the market price of Shanxi coal was 10 taels per ton, an increase of about 0.75 taels compared to last week's selling price. Furthermore, Hongqi coal dust is the most scarce in stock and is quite difficult to purchase. The selling price per ton has also risen by 0.05 taels, and the current selling price is 11.25 taels per ton.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 210 pieces of Huzhou silk will be shipped to Canada tomorrow.</p>

<h3>National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Jiangsu National Crisis Relief Association, people from various provinces in Shanghai have responded enthusiastically. After several discussions, the inaugural meeting of the National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China was held yesterday. More than 500 people from 16 provinces attended. Chu Fucheng, Wen Zongyao, Peng Yunyi, and Zhang Yaozeng were elected as the presidium. The meeting passed the association's charter, declaration, and telegram, and resolved to oppose military rule. Finally, directors and supervisors were elected and the meeting adjourned. The declaration is recorded below: "Declaration of the National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China" The saying goes, "People must insult themselves before others insult them; a country must attack itself before others attack it." After the European War, even the weak and small nations of the world, under the aegis of justice and humanity, have established nations and striven for self-determination. Yet our ancient and great Chinese nation, in broad daylight, is being wantonly trampled upon in its sovereignty and its land seized, staging an unprecedented humiliation since the founding of the Republic. Who is responsible for this, and why has it come to this? The brutal and unbridled Japanese militarists are certainly intolerable to the world's justice, but the blame for our nation's self-inflicted insults in recent years cannot be excused either. What is meant by self-insult? Looking at it comprehensively from political and social perspectives, the details are too numerous to mention. Only the greatest and most obvious will be discussed. A group of people within the country advocates party rule, seizes political power, and positions itself as the ruling class, disregarding the status of the majority of citizens as masters of the nation. This is the first self-insult. This group has never lacked clear doctrines, political programs, and policies, but when exercising governing power, they often contradict themselves. The military administration does not focus on national defense planning, but only on internal strife. The financial administration does not focus on production and construction, but only on extravagance. The diplomatic administration does not focus on sound and effective strategies and unwavering preparation, but only on empty rhetoric. All measures are designed to embellish peace and prosperity to deceive the people. This is the second self-insult. Having formed a party, factions within the party are divided and stand opposed to each other, forgetting the important mission of nation-building entrusted to them, and only knowing how to exploit their special status to compete for public and private power. This is the third self-insult. People outside the party have reverted to the pre-Republic era of not discussing politics. Regarding major national policies, they either remain silent or resort to murmuring in private, never stepping forward with a bright, upright, and responsible attitude to help the country. This is the fourth self-insult. When things rot, worms breed. With the nation insulting and attacking itself in this way, how can we expect a powerful enemy not to insult and attack us? Now that a great disaster has erupted, and a great mistake has been made, has our nation awakened? Has it repented? Then, starting from today, let us sweep away the roots of self-insult and self-attack between parties, between parties and the people, and between the people themselves. Let us forge the 400 million people into one, to stand together as masters of the nation, to jointly shoulder the mission of rescuing the weak and extinguishing the flames. Those who looked down upon and insulted each other in the past should transform into mutual love and mutual assistance, truly united and truly striving, learning from the French people after the Franco-Prussian War, learning from the German people after the European War. With the goal of restoring the integrity of the territory of the Republic of China and ending the national crisis, even if the enemy's offensive is fierce, it will surely restrain itself one day. Even if the national situation is precarious, it will surely strengthen itself one day. The key lies in whether our people can unite and realize the principle of sovereignty residing in the people. The situation is urgent. We, the members, respectfully respond to the psychology of our people who refuse to insult themselves, initiate this association as an expression of national unity, to open up a path to remedy and save the country. Fellow countrymen, come and join us!</p>
<h3>Song Qingling's Declaration</h3>
<p>Song Qingling yesterday issued a personal declaration, saying, "The Kuomintang has long lost its status as a revolutionary group. This has become an undeniable fact today. What destroys the Kuomintang is not its external enemies, but its internal leaders. Since Mr. Sun's death in Beiping in the fourteenth year, the National Revolution suddenly lost its mentor, almost leading to its interruption. Fortunately, the comrades in Guangdong at that time恪遵Mr. Sun's teachings, took the masses as the foundation of the revolution. The Northern Expeditionary Force was eventually able to pacify the Yangtze River Basin in the shortest possible time. However, since the separation of Ning and Han in the sixteenth year, due to Chiang Kai-shek's personal dictatorship and the contention between warlords and bureaucrats, the party and the masses have increasingly drifted apart, using anti-communism as a pretext to carry out reactionary actions, using all kinds of阴很险毒, corruption, and deception. At the central level, they occupy important positions, operating for personal gain and consolidating their positions. At the local level, they oppress the people, acting tyrannically. Opportunistic remnants of warlords can leap to become the mainstay of the party-state, while loyal revolutionary talents must be found a way to put to death. The recent tragic killing of Deng Yanda, who was坚苦卓絶, loyal, brave, and奋发, is one example. In the past five years, internal wars and political struggles have continued endlessly. The party has disintegrated, and they have not hesitated to beg for pity from imperialism, using corrupt forces to do everything that the Beiyang warlords and bureaucrats dared not do, all of which is brazenly done in the name of party rule, making the party bear the unjust charge, incurring the hatred and contempt of the people across the country. In fact, the Three Principles of the People have never been put into practice for a single day. Recently, the confrontation between Ning and Guangdong has exposed each other's shortcomings, boasting of their strengths. 'Political openness,' 'democratic centralism,' 'revolutionary diplomacy,' all kinds of terms are not unpleasant to hear, but in reality, both rely on warlords, flatter imperialism, betray the masses, and are both criminals of the revolution. Since the outbreak of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, both sides, forced by the national crisis and public opinion, have had to temporarily suspend their internecine warfare, carrying out their so-called peaceful unification, running around for meetings, which has lasted for more than three months. The focus of the debate is the distribution of central committee members and the selection of high-ranking officials, without a word of discussion on the suffering and interests of the vast majority of peasants and workers. They do not know that the creation of dictatorship, the degeneration of the party, and the decline of the country are all the results of being separated from the peasants and workers. Only by taking peasants and workers as the mainstay of the revolution can the degeneration of revolutionary forces be prevented and the foundation of the national economy be established. Apart from this, speaking of peaceful unification, even if it proceeds smoothly and everyone gets what they want, the result will only be peaceful division of spoils and unified evildoing. What joy do the people have in seeing this peace? What value does the country have in having this unification? I cannot bear to see the revolutionary foundation painstakingly built by Mr. Sun for forty years destroyed by a small number of selfish and self-interested ambitious party members, and I especially do not want to see the country of 400 million Chinese people destroyed by the Chinese Kuomintang, which betrays its own principles. I must at this time offer my most straightforward and sincere advice. Mr. Sun established the party for the revolution. If the party cannot save the country and benefit the people, what is there to be concerned about in self-destruction? I firmly believe that only a revolutionary force that is truly based on the masses and fights for the masses can eliminate warlords and bureaucrats, eradicate imperialism, and realize socialism. At the same time, I deeply believe that China's true revolutionaries will not be passively afraid and shrink back because of the terror and killing of reactionary forces, but will instead strengthen their determination to sacrifice and fight due to the pressure of the environment and the cries of the masses, regardless of everything, and advance together on the great road of revolution. December 19, 20th year, Song Qingling."</p>

<p>▲Solemn Declaration: The Shanghai Labor Union Representative Assembly solemnly declares regarding the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipality General Labor Union, "Our Party takes leading the masses and striving for revolution as its banner. The past revolutionary achievements were all due to the majority of the masses fighting and striving under the leadership of our Party, so the Party's strength could be concentrated and the Party's foundation could be consolidated. However, since the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the leaders of the Party have often been reluctant to shoulder the responsibility of leadership, and a small number of corrupt and degenerate elements have taken the opportunity to infiltrate the Party. The fact that the Party itself has become alienated from, deceived, and oppressed the masses has become increasingly apparent. The masses, in their disappointment, have criticized the Party and lost their faith. As a result, domestic politics has also lost its important center, leading to the current crisis of fragmentation and disintegration. Today, the people of the whole country are looking forward to the revival of the Party's rule. It is imperative to plan without delay. We, the members, dare to jointly issue the following propositions from the standpoint of the people: A. Regarding Party affairs: 1. The Party takes democratic centralism as its principle. Future organizations and facilities should be absolutely democratized, and under no circumstances should the mistakes of past dictatorship be repeated under any name. 2. The Party takes the masses as its foundation and should effectively integrate with the masses to enrich itself and fulfill its responsibility to lead the masses in carrying out its principles. 3. The Party is the greatest driving force in national politics, and all political and military affairs should be subject to the Party's control, so as to implement the principle of governing the country through the Party. 4. Party and government personnel in charge should not hold concurrent positions, so as to avoid the evils of the Party hindering the government or the government encroaching on the Party. B. Regarding the mass movement: The mass movement should be guided by the Party, but its independence and freedom must be respected. C. Regarding the labor movement: 1. Raise the status of workers and protect workers' organizations. 2. Abolish the current Trade Union Law and all labor laws and regulations, and re-enact Trade Union Law and Labor Regulations that effectively protect workers' organizations based on the labor laws and regulations personally drafted by Premier Sun in the thirteenth year, and formally appoint representatives from the labor circle to attend and participate in the drafting of the regulations. 3. Workers' organizations have vertical and horizontal organizations, and their establishment is supported. 4. Workers shall not be distinguished or discriminated against based on their knowledge, profession, or service organization, and shall have the right to organize trade unions equally. 5. The government authorities should provide effective relief to unemployed workers. 6. Recognize the workers' absolute right to strike freely. 7. Restore the original organizations of various workers' and trade unions during the eighteenth year of the Republic of China. 8. Support the organization of trade unions by unorganized workers. The above points are the most salient. Detailed plans still need to be confirmed and implemented one by one by the Party and state officials and gentlemen from all walks of life. As for the propositions on diplomacy and the Sino-Japanese issue, they have been seen in previous telegrams and declarations, and will not be repeated here. We, the members, will not forget the legacy and have unanimously resolved to establish the Shanghai City General Labor Union today in order to rectify the workers' movement and implement labor policies, unite the strength of workers throughout the city, and continue to fight, so that the city's labor movement can enter the right track and the Party and state's future can gradually move towards a bright future. This is not only the goal of our 800,000 fellow workers working with sincerity and effort, but also the great plan that 400 million compatriots earnestly pray for. From now on, our 800,000 fellow workers throughout the city will be dear, sincere, and united, upholding principles under the leadership of the Party and the City General Labor Union, acting according to the right path, striving to revitalize industries, and improve labor welfare. We hope that the Party and state officials and domestic sages will not hesitate to impart their wisdom and provide assistance from time to time, so that not only will our fellow workers throughout the city be eternally grateful, but the future of the Party and the state will truly rely on it. Shanghai City Labor Representatives Assembly."</p>

<h3>What Was Heard After the Disputes at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>▲ The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Conducted Business as Usual Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ The Commercial Movement Committee Held a Representative Assembly Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ News from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Special Municipality Commercial Movement Committee sent Zhao Nangong, Liu Musu, Chen Zhiying, and three others to take over the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce the day before yesterday without success, the Municipal Government ordered the Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Defense Corps to send police to protect all departments of the chamber, which continued to operate as usual. Yesterday, the chamber also convened a joint meeting of all executive and supervisory committee members, resolving to issue a joint statement and send two urgent telegrams expressing support for Mr. Wang Jingwei's national salvation conference and requesting Chen</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Mingshu, Wu Tiecheng, and Shao Lizi to come to Shanghai as soon as possible to guide Shanghai's party affairs. The following are recordings of various news reports:</p>
<p>▲ Held a Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committee Members Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held an emergency joint meeting of all executive committee members and supervisory committee members. Those present included Ye Huijun, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Yuan Ludeng, Lu Wenshao, Lu Fengzhu, Wu Zhihao, Xu Jiqing, Lu Qinghua, Fang Jiaobo, Cai Yunqing, Zhu Wenqi, Wen Lanting, Cheng Xiechun, Lao Jingxiu, Lu Qisheng, Chen Songyuan, Feng Jiliang, Xiang Songmao, Jiang Zhigang, and others, totaling twenty people. Wang Xiaolai presided over the meeting. After the formalities, the chairman reported in detail on the disturbances that occurred the day before yesterday and read out the letter from the Shanghai Special Municipality Commercial Movement Committee. Subsequently, the committee members expressed their opinions, all expressing great indignation. After three hours of discussion, it was resolved: (1) To express satisfaction with the measures taken by the standing committee to deal with the temporary emergency situation and to ratify all its actions; (2) To pass the chamber's urgent declaration; (3) To issue a joint statement in the name of all executive and supervisory committee members, expressing a firm stance.</p>
<p>▲ Issued a Joint Statement The entire executive and supervisory committee of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a joint statement yesterday stating that the entire executive and supervisory committee of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the so-called Shanghai Special Municipality Commercial Movement Committee's disturbance of the chamber on the 18th of this month, leading a crowd of plainclothes individuals, constitutes a complete act of destruction. Therefore, after convening a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on the 19th of this month, it was resolved to issue the following joint statement: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce was formally established on June 22nd of the 19th year of the Republic of China, in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law promulgated by the National Government on August 15th of the 18th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the members of various industry associations who attended numbered 129, and the store members numbered 23, totaling 297 member representatives. Furthermore, Central Party Headquarters representative Yu Wenxian, National Government and Municipal Government representative Pan Gongzhan, Ministry of Industry and Commerce representative Zhao Jinqing, and National Commercial Federation Chairman Lin Kanghou all attended and provided guidance. Huijun, Lanting, and others were elected as executive committee members and supervisory committee members by the attending members through legal voting at the general meeting on that day. This is the process by which the chamber was legally established and the committee members were legally elected. (2) The Chamber of Commerce Law was passed by the Legislative Yuan on July 20th of the 18th year of the Republic of China, during Mr. Hu Hanmin's tenure as the head of the Legislative Yuan, and was promulgated by the National Government. In accordance with this law, there are clear and detailed regulations regarding the terms of office and re-election procedures for executive and supervisory committee members. Even if an officer is dismissed or ordered to resign due to cause, there must be sufficient reason and legal procedures. Therefore, the members of this chamber, in accordance with national laws and the public opinion entrusted by the members, cannot accept anyone using any name or illegal means or coercion to demand a handover. (3) According to the letter from the Shanghai Special Municipality Commercial Movement Committee to this chamber, delivered by Zhao Nangong, it stated, "It has been found that the Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce was illegally reorganized by the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters in April of the 18th year of the Republic of China." This is even more suspicious. When was the Shanghai Special Municipality Commercial Movement Committee established? According to the announcement of the committee published in the announcement column of various newspapers on the 18th of this month, it states that it was organized "by order." However, it has not clearly stated what kind of order it was issued under. Upon investigation, at the time of unifying the Shanghai merchant organization in the 18th year of the Republic of China, the central executive committee members were Jiang Zhongzheng, Dai Chuanxian, He Yingqin, Hu Hanmin, Xi Ke, Yan Xishan, Chen Guofu, Chen Mingshu, Zhu Peide, Ye Chucang, Wu Tiecheng, Feng Yuxiang, Yu Youren, Song Qingling, Song Ziwen, Wang Zhaoming, Wu Chaochu, He Chengjun, Li Wenfan, Wang Boling, Shao Yuanchong, Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Qun, Liu Zhi, Yang Shuzhuang, Fang Zhenwu, Zhao Daiwen, Zhou Qigang, Chen Lifu, Chen Zhaoying, Liu Jiwen, Liu Luyin, Ding Weifen, Zeng Yangfu, Fang Juehui, and 35 others. The central supervisory committee members were Wu Jingheng, Zhang Renjie, Gu Yingfen, Lin Sen, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Ji, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, Li Shizeng, Deng Zeru, Xiao Focheng, Enke Batu, and 12 others. At that time, the country was unified, and the party headquarters had not split. Not only had the current Extraordinary Conference of the Central Committee in Guangzhou not yet been established, but even the previous Enlarged Conference had not yet been produced. The figures in charge of the current Extraordinary Conference of the Central Committee in Guangzhou, such as Xiao Focheng, Deng Zeru, Gu Yingfen, Sun Ke, Wang Zhaoming, Wu Chaochu, Li Wenfan, Liu Jiwen, and other gentlemen, were all members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees at that time. The case of unifying the Shanghai Special Municipality merchant organization was resolved by the 7th Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Committee on May 2nd of the 18th year. The chairman of that meeting was Committee Member Sun Ke. The resolutions were: (1) All Shanghai Special Municipality merchant organizations shall cease activities. (2) Yu Qiaqing and 34 others shall be appointed as members of the reorganization committee. Furthermore, on May 16th, the 13th Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Committee resolved that the Shanghai Merchant Organization Reorganization Committee shall act on behalf of the former Shanghai Businessmen's Association, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce, and the Nanshi Chamber of Commerce, and appointed Hu Hanmin and six other committee members to draft the organizational outline of the reorganization committee. The chairman of that meeting was Committee Member Ye Chucang. Furthermore, on May 23rd, the 14th Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Committee passed the organizational outline of the reorganization committee. The chairman of that meeting was Committee Member Hu Hanmin. Now, the Shanghai Special Municipality Commercial Movement Committee accuses the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters of illegal reorganization, which means that they consider the resolutions of the three Central Party Affairs meetings chaired by Committee Members Sun Ke, Ye Chucang, and Hu Hanmin to be illegal. The committee members of this chamber do not know how it can be considered legal. (4) Since the National Government promulgated the Chamber of Commerce Law, it has repeatedly issued clear orders to reorganize according to the law within a prescribed time limit. In the north, the General Chambers of Commerce of Peiping and Tianjin were reorganized into the Peiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Tianjin Municipal Chamber of Commerce. In the south, the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce was also reorganized into the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The formal establishment of this municipal chamber of commerce was extremely proper and legal. Now, the Commercial Movement Committee believes that it is necessary to restore the Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce, and it is not known on what legal basis it is based. (5) The actions of a group should be bound by the will of the members of the group's organization. The various guilds, public offices, and public associations affiliated with the former Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce have now been reorganized into various industry associations according to the law. Today's newspapers have published a joint statement by 160 industry associations opposing this illegal action. The public opinion is already clearly visible. As for the officers of the former Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce: (1) There were a total of three chairmen: Mr. Feng Shaoshan, Mr. Lin Kanghou, and Mr. Zhao Jinqing. When the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was established, Mr. Zhao Jinqing was serving as the director of the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and came to give instructions on behalf of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Mr. Lin Kanghou also attended the meeting and delivered a speech as the chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce. (2) There were a total of four standing committee members: Mr. Lu Fengzhu, Mr. Ying Zhikun, Mr. Hu Xisheng, and Mr. Xu Jiqing. Mr. Lu Fengzhu, Mr. Hu Xisheng, and Mr. Xu Jiqing all served as members of the Commercial Reorganization Committee. Mr. Hu Xisheng also served as the director of the finance department of the Commercial Reorganization Committee. Currently, Mr. Xu Jiqing is a standing committee member of this chamber, and Mr. Lu Fengzhu is an executive committee member of this chamber. (3) There were 52 executive committee members. Among them, except for Mr. Huang Chujiu, Mr. Chen Caibao, Mr. Xu Qingyun, and Mr. Tao Meisheng, who have passed away, among the remaining 48, Sun Jingxi, Pei Yunqing, Wang Jiean, Fu Zuoheng, Wu Weiru, Yu Qiaqing, Wen Lanting, Xu Busun, Chen Canglai, Ye Huijun, Chen Yushu, Ye Fuxiao, Yuan Ludeng, Zhu Wenqi, Lao Jingxiu, Wu Zhihao, Xu Tingzuo, Yao Dexin, Zheng Xitang, Lu Peiyuan, Gu Xin, Chen Liangyu, Yan Junan, Chen Yizhou, You Senting, Chen Songyuan, and 26 others are now member representatives of this chamber. Furthermore, eight of them are current executive and supervisory committee members of this chamber. If the Commercial Reorganization Committee was illegally reorganized, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was also illegally established, and it is necessary to restore the former Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce, then why did most of the officers of the former General Chamber of Commerce either come to this chamber to give speeches or serve as members of this chamber, and not consider it illegal? Moreover, among the 22 current executive and supervisory committee members of this chamber, ten are former committee members of the General Chamber of Commerce. Now, Mr. Wang Jingwei is advocating the construction of democratic politics, with the sovereignty of the country residing in the people, and politics must seek democracy. The main body of the Chamber of Commerce is the industry association, and it must also take the will of the industry association as its will. If a small minority acts to violently seize the Chamber of Commerce, and its establishment goes against the public opinion of businessmen and the destruction of the spirit of the rule of law, then it is even more deeply believed by the members of this chamber. The above five points are a joint statement based on legal principles and facts, calmly and quietly, hoping that the government authorities, party and state leaders, and people from all walks of life, the entire business community, will give it practical consideration and make a fair judgment. The members of this chamber will never abandon their responsibilities unless through legally prescribed procedures. They will not yield to force and will only act in accordance with the law. We respectfully inform the people of the country. The first executive committee members of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce are Huijun, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Yuan Ludeng, Lu Wenshao, Lu Fengzhu, Wu Zhihao, Xu Ji, Luo Qinghua (Fang Jiaobo, Pei Huoqing, Zhu Wenqi, Ju Songsun, Gu Xin Yi, Xiang Songmao. The first supervisory committee members are Wen Lanting, Cheng Fenchun, Lao Jingxiu, Lu Qisheng, Chen Songyuan Ma Jiliang, Jiang Zhigang, December 19th, 20th year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>▲ Qin Runqing Issued a Statement Mr. Qin Runqing, chairman of the industry association, issued a statement yesterday saying that he regrets the disputes that occurred at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday. At a time when foreign troubles are pressing and internal worries are mounting, it is appropriate to unite as one to seek external solutions. Moreover, with the end of the year approaching, financial relations are particularly important. If disputes are re-ignited, affecting the market, the impact will be great. He sincerely hopes that all parties will understand and not repeat the suffering of our people.</p>
<p>▲ Three Associations Deny Being Listed The cotton cloth, refined products, and department store industry associations issued a statement denying that they were listed in the notice of the meeting convened by the Commercial Movement Committee, stating that today, our associations received a notice, which was headed by the so-called Shanghai Special Municipality Commercial Movement Committee, convening a meeting at the New World National Products Commercial Center, and listing our associations in the notice. Upon investigation, our associations have already issued a joint declaration yesterday regarding the coercion of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce by the crowd the day before yesterday, expressing opposition to violent seizure and supporting the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the newspapers have published it clearly. How could there be a fact of being listed in an illegal meeting again? It is obviously someone who has been falsely listed. Our associations cannot recognize it and hereby make a solemn statement.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram from the Fourth Central Committee The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the First Executive Committee of the Fourth Central Committee in Nanjing yesterday, stating that the Fourth Central Committee, First Executive Committee, Nanjing, is respectfully informed that peace has been achieved, the party and the country are shining again, gathering the talents of the country to seek great plans for national salvation, pacifying the interior and resisting foreign aggression, holding the country in danger, laying the foundation for democratic politics, and bringing the people of the country into the right path. In particular, we hope that Mr. Wang Jingwei's proposal to convene a national salvation conference will be approved and implemented quickly, so that leaders from all walks of life can express their views and jointly face the national crisis, with one heart and one mind, pooling their wisdom and efforts, unifying the will of the country, and encouraging each other with perseverance. The council leads from above, and this chamber respectfully represents the merchants of the city to unanimously support it. I am eagerly awaiting your reply. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Hao,</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Three Commissioners The chamber, with the Central Party Headquarters, resolved to send Commissioners Chen Mingshu, Shao Lizi, and Wu Tiecheng to guide the party affairs of this city. Yesterday, it specially telegraphed the three commissioners, stating that Nanjing sent Chen Zhenru, Shao Lizi, and Wu Tiecheng for your inspection. The report stated that you have been ordered to guide Shanghai's party affairs. We are extremely delighted. Shanghai is the economic center of the country and the focus of world attention. Maintaining security and reforming party affairs are all related to international vision and hearing. We respectfully request that you come to Shanghai immediately to preside over everything, so that actions that overstep the bounds of law will not be seen again in Shanghai, calming the hearts of the bewildered and preventing foreign criticism. I am eagerly awaiting your orders. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Hao,</p>

<p>▲ Chairman's Report Zhang Zilian was elected chairman, and Peng Xuehai recorded the minutes. After the formalities, the chairman first reported on the purpose of the meeting and the process of the Commercial Movement Committee being organized by order. His speech stated, "Today, we are convening representatives from various industries and members of the business community to attend this meeting. The purpose is to voluntarily rise up, remove all shackles, and obtain the freedom that we deserve. Since the General Chamber of Commerce was forcibly occupied, three years have passed. We have suffered pain and oppression without being able to complain. This time, the political situation has been reorganized, and after contacting the authorities, this Commercial Movement Association, which truly represents businessmen, has been produced, with the 'power' to deal with everything. However, the purpose of convening this meeting is to develop the true meaning of all Shanghai businessmen and to discuss and resolve future directions in order to obtain its 'ability.' Therefore, this time the takeover of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was also upright and aboveboard. Although it was not successful, it was entirely due to the shameless occupation of those people. All of us businessmen should still seek unity and deal with it together in order to achieve our goals."</p>
<p>▲ Key Matters Resolved (1) Restore the Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce, the Business Community Federations of various roads, the Nanshi Chamber of Commerce, the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce, and the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, to promote commercial movement. (2) Report Wang Yansong for abusing his party position for personal gain, oppressing the people, and destroying people's movement. It was resolved to report to the civil court and combine the cases. (4) Oppose the Shanghai Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for violating the will of the people, restore the commercial movement, alleviate the suffering of businessmen, and promote the freedom of businessmen's will. It was resolved that the associations whose names were falsely listed should publish in the newspaper to deny all actions of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>▲ Temporary Motions (1) More than ten groups, including the Eyeglass Frame Industry, Department Store Industry, Knitting Industry, and Refining Industry, proposed to deny the declaration of 160 industry associations published in today's newspapers, stating that they had never agreed to it and had not stamped it. It was resolved to pass it, and the representatives who attended the meeting signed it and published it in the newspaper to deny it. (2) The Knitting, Department Store, Auction Industries, etc., proposed to initiate a "Preparatory Committee for the Restoration of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce" to actively work on it. It was resolved that the representatives of the various groups attending the meeting would be responsible for the preparations, and the second meeting would be convened by the Commercial Movement Committee. (3) The Ironware and Knitting Industries proposed that the representatives attending today's meeting would jointly convene all industry associations in the city to discuss reorganizing the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to express public opinion. It was resolved to pass it, and it was decided to hold the meeting at the New World at 3:00 PM on Tuesday. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>French Minister Wilden Published a Declaration Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Denying the Franco-Japanese Secret Agreement</p>
<p>▲ And the Invasion of China by French Troops</p>
<p>The French Havas Agency reported on the 19th that French Minister to China Wilden came to Shanghai from Beijing. Recently, due to certain newspapers continuing to publish news of France making military preparations at the border between Vietnam and China, he specially issued the following declaration to the agency in the name of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Vietnamese government: (1) France and Japan have no secret agreement. (2) No military preparations have been made at the border between Vietnam and China, and no military or civilian aircraft have flown in Chinese airspace. Chinese officials in Longzhou and the Vietnamese government continue to communicate and do not believe in these rumors at all. (3) The director of the Yunnan office in Beijing has already telegraphed General Long Yun, chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government, and received a reply stating that the French army has not invaded Yunnan, and Yunnan and Vietnam have a good relationship. (4) A certain newspaper claimed that French troops robbed in Gao Bangqiang, but Gao Bangqiang belongs to Vietnam, and I do not understand the robbery. (5) Vietnam has been harassed by the Communist Party, and France will certainly take necessary precautions. These measures are definitely not used to deal with China. Minister Wilden concluded that if France's policy needs to be explained, then the recent meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council should be explained. For the past two months, French Foreign Minister Briand has made great efforts to help resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, which no one can deny. And no one can deny his tireless efforts for the cause of peace, so that the peaceful situation can continue to be maintained.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Committee Will Arrive Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>▲ Tan Zhen, Li Liejun, and others Will Enter Beijing First This Morning</p>
<p>The 19 members of the Guangdong Committee, including Chen Jitang, Huang Shaoxiong, and Ma Chaojun, arrived in Shanghai on the Changxing Company's Russian Empress ship from Hong Kong the day before yesterday. It was originally scheduled to arrive here at about 5:00 PM today, but due to the fog at sea yesterday, the ship was delayed and could not arrive as scheduled. According to the company, it will probably be delayed until about 8:00 AM tomorrow morning before it can arrive here. At that time, the company will specially prepare small steamships to travel between Pudong and the Xinguankoutou to pick up and drop off passengers. It is estimated that Chen and others will take the company's small steamship to cross the river and land at the Xinguankoutou. It is also heard that after Chen and others arrive in Shanghai, they will rest briefly and then take the Jinghu afternoon train or night train together to Beijing to attend the meeting. As for the eight members of the Central Committee in Shanghai, Tan Zhen, Li Liejun, Cheng Qian, Fang Zhenwu, Xiong Kewu, Zhang Zhiben, Fu Rulin, and Chen Jiayou, they originally intended to wait for Chen Jitang and others to arrive in Shanghai today before going to Beijing together. However, due to the postponement of Chen and others' arrival in Shanghai and the opening date of the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee already reaching, they decided to take the Jinghu early train at 9:30 AM today and go to Beijing first to attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan Talks About Party Affairs, Commercial and Industrial Disputes</h3>
<p>▲ Party Affairs Must Wait for Central Resolution</p>
<p>▲ Chamber of Commerce Presented to the Municipal Government for Handling</p>
<p>▲ The General Labor Union Has No Legal Basis</p>
<p>The China News Agency reported that disputes between party affairs, the Chamber of Commerce, the Labor Union, and various groups have been recurring in this city recently. A reporter from the China News Agency visited Mr. Pan Gongzhan at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday and asked for his views. He answered as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Party Affairs Issues The executive and supervisory committee members of the Municipal Party Department are all elected by party members throughout the city and have been approved by the Central Committee. Therefore, they were produced in accordance with the law. Although there has been a general resignation, their mission has not ended before the Central Committee has expressly approved it. Therefore, the work will naturally continue as usual. As for the so-called improvement committee and other organizations, the party constitution has no regulations, and they are not elected by party members throughout the city or appointed by the Central Committee. Therefore, although the current Municipal Party Department committee members are eager to resign to reduce their responsibilities, they will definitely not be able to hand over to any illegally produced organization. As for the improvement committee issue, the Municipal Party Department has submitted a request to the Central Committee for resolution.</p>
<p>▲ Chamber of Commerce Issues National peace and social order depend on the maintenance of the law. The Social Affairs Bureau has always relied on the law to resolve any incident. The establishment of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was established in accordance with the law. It naturally exists before it is formally reorganized in accordance with the law. Yesterday, the so-called Commercial Movement Committee went to take over. The Social Affairs Bureau did not know about this matter in advance. We do not know what the basis of the association is. As for what happened yesterday, we have already sent people to investigate and have submitted a report to the Municipal Government. How to resolve it in the future will be handled by the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>▲ Labor Union Issues Upon investigation, the People's Organization Law and the Labor Union Law promulgated by the Central Committee do not have an organizational law for the General Labor Union. Before the Central Committee promulgates a new organizational law, there is naturally no need to organize the General Labor Union. Moreover, the establishment of people's organizations has always required the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau to send people to guide them. The fact that there are two places organizing the General Labor Union today, I do not know about.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan's Two Replies</h3>
<p>▲ Reply to the Life Weekly Agency's Telegram The Life Weekly Agency previously telegraphed General Ma to inquire about whether there was a proper way to extract the remittance, to avoid fraudulent receipt, in order to ensure the safe delivery of the donation to General Ma. Now it is learned that the agency has received a reply telegram from General Ma from Hailun, stating that the telegram from the Life Weekly Agency has been respectfully received. All funds entrusted to your agency by various parties can be extracted by the commissioner of our office in Harbin with my official seal, so that it will not be fraudulently received. Please remit the funds to us. In addition to the successive remittances, we will report to you after we have collected all of them. Sincerely, Ma Zhanshan (seal)." It is also learned that as of the 18th, the agency has received a total of 105,934 yuan and 45 cents in donations to General Wei Zhanshan. Except for the 55,507 yuan that has been remitted to General Ma and received, the rest are being remitted.</p>
<p>▲ Reply to the Lida Academy's Telegram The teachers and students of the Shanghai Jiangwan Lida Academy previously entrusted the Bank of China to remit 400 yuan to General Ma Zhanshan on the 10th of this month. It is learned that the academy has received a reply telegram from General Ma, stating that the telegram from the Shanghai Jiangwan Lida Academy has been respectfully received. Thank you for your encouragement and generous donation. I hereby express my sincere gratitude to my troops. Our government has now moved to Hailun, and the funds have been sent to Harbin to be transferred. Sincerely, Ma Zhanshan (seal).</p>

<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Repays Old Debt Public Bonds</h3>
<p>▲ Available for Collection from January 4th Next Year Upon Presentation of Bonds</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in order to repay the principal and interest of the construction public bonds of the former General Chamber of Commerce and the South Shanghai Chamber of Commerce starting from January 4th of the twenty-first year of the Republic, issued an announcement yesterday, which is detailed below:</p>
<p>▲ First Announcement Regarding the Repayment of Principal and Interest of Construction Public Bonds of the Former General Chamber of Commerce states: The former Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in order to build a meeting hall and a product exhibition hall, issued the first and second rounds of construction public bonds. The original plan at the time specified that the additional 30% membership fee collected would be used as collateral. Each installment of principal and interest was repaid according to the plan. However, since the seventeenth year of the Republic, the former Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce claimed that the membership fees were insufficient, and the principal and interest payments were temporarily suspended. The outstanding amount includes one installment (the twelfth) from the first round and three installments (the tenth to the twelfth) from the second round. After the establishment of this Chamber of Commerce, all additional 30% membership fees collected have been specifically earmarked and strictly prohibited from being misappropriated. It is estimated that by the end of this year, all the additional membership fees collected will be sufficient to repay the above four installments of principal and interest. Therefore, at the second members' meeting in July of this year, it was already resolved that repayment would begin in January of the twenty-first year of the Republic. A special announcement is hereby made in accordance with the plan. Bondholders can go to the Finance Department of this Chamber of Commerce to collect the principal and interest upon presentation of the bonds, starting from January 4th next year, every day from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, except for Sundays and other public holidays. As for the reorganization public bonds raised by the former General Chamber of Commerce in the fourteenth year of the Republic, after the current construction public bonds are repaid, the additional 30% membership fees collected from the twenty-first year of the Republic can be transferred as collateral for this item of principal and interest. A separate notice will be issued after a plan is devised.</p>
<p>▲ Second Announcement Regarding the Repayment of Construction Public Bonds of the Former South Shanghai Chamber of Commerce states: The former South Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in order to build a meeting hall, issued public bonds, originally designating the rental income from the Chamber's property as collateral. The principal and interest were paid up to the fourth installment. After the takeover by the former Merchant Organizations Reorganization Committee, it was further resolved that the rental income from the Chamber's meeting hall, which was rented to the Social Affairs Bureau, would be stored together for the purpose of allocating it to repay the principal and interest of these public bonds. This Chamber of Commerce was established and continued to handle this matter. It is estimated that by the end of this year, this rental income will be sufficient to repay the principal and interest of the fifth installment. Therefore, at the second members' meeting in July of this year, it was resolved that repayment would begin in January of the twenty-first year of the Republic. A special announcement is hereby made in accordance with the plan. Holders of bonds for the fifth installment of the construction public bonds of the former South Shanghai Chamber of Commerce can go to the Finance Department of this Chamber of Commerce to collect the principal and interest upon presentation of the bonds, starting from January 4th of the twenty-first year of the Republic, every day from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, except for Sundays and public holidays. This announcement is hereby made.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Assists in Collecting and Paying Business Tax</h3>
<p>▲ Office Issued a Notice Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Office for Assisting in the Collection and Payment of Business Tax issued Notice No. 1 yesterday, stating: For the purpose of notification, the implementation of business tax in this city is imminent. The Municipal Finance Bureau has entrusted the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to handle the collection matters and has assigned members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to organize this office to specially handle this matter. The first step is for the businesses to fill out a business operator declaration form so that the government can compile a tax collection roster and collect taxes on a regular basis. The Finance Bureau has already announced an extension for the declaration form and reminded that penalties will be imposed for violations. The extension period is about to expire, but shops in various industries have not yet completely filled out the forms, which is a delay. Therefore, personnel are specially dispatched to urge compliance. It is hoped that attention will be paid to the following key points and that the forms will be filled out and submitted as soon as possible to avoid penalties by the government. This announcement is hereby made. The details are as follows: (1) All shops in various industries that have already established industry associations, regardless of whether they have joined the association as members, should directly obtain the forms from the association, fill them out, and then submit them to the association for forwarding. (2) Shops in various industries that do not yet have an industry association should directly obtain the forms from this office (inside the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Palace Bridge), fill them out, and then submit them to this office. (3) If shops in various industries have any unclear points regarding the declaration procedures, they can ask the personnel who come to them for clarification. They will be informed clearly. If the personnel have any questions regarding the scope of the business tax, please also inform them as much as possible to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<h3>Party Affairs Improvement Association Cables to Welcome Chen, Wu, and Shao to Guide Party Affairs</h3>
<p>The Party Affairs Improvement Association cabled the Central Committee members Chen, Wu, and Shao yesterday, stating: To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, please forward to Committee Members Chen Mingshu, Wu Tiecheng, and Shao Lizi, Recently, we learned that the Central Party Conference has resolved to send the three committee members to Shanghai to guide party affairs. We are extremely pleased to hear this. (Omission) The Association was produced by the city-wide emergency congress of party members and temporarily holds the functions of the municipal party headquarters. We respectfully represent the city's party members in sincerely welcoming you and earnestly hope that you will come to Shanghai as soon as possible to provide guidance. We eagerly await your arrival. The Shanghai Special Municipality Party Affairs Improvement Association of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<h3>Five District Branches' Propositions on Party Affairs</h3>
<p>The Second, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth District Branches of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Chinese Kuomintang jointly telegraphed: To party headquarters at all levels, all organizations, and all newspapers, Since Comrade Chiang Kai-shek resigned, there has been hope for reform in both party affairs and politics. Examining past facts, we believe that the goals of improvement should be as follows: The corruption of party affairs in the past was due to the loss of the spirit of democracy. Party members did not have the right to free elections, resulting in a few people being able to manipulate and control them through bribery and coercion, forming a phenomenon of a minority suppressing the majority. In the future, party affairs must first abolish the system of pre-selected candidates to restore the electoral rights of party members so that party members have a deeper relationship with the party. Secondly, all issues within the party must be discussed openly, with the minority submitting to the majority. In this way, the spirit of democracy can be realized. The current political focus should be on diplomacy. However, internal unity must precede external unity. Comrades in our party should unite as one in the future. The people of the whole country must also unite as one, and only then will we have strength externally. In diplomatic matters, we advocate adhering to the principles of no withdrawal of troops and no negotiations, and we oppose the signing of any conditions that harm our rights. Before clarifying the intention, we also oppose the arrival of international investigation teams in China. In domestic affairs, we support the convening of a national crisis conference or a national salvation conference to allow the people to participate in the government and seek the realization of national unity against foreign aggression, guiding political tutelage on the path to constitutionalism. In the past, mass movements were inactive. Now that the diplomatic situation is urgent, the strength of the masses is the only force against foreign aggression and must be restored, which has already been restored in practice. However, in the labor movement, there must be an organization of the General Labor Union. The distinction between industry and commerce should not be based on the nature of the organization served but on whether it is employed. Therefore, shop clerks should have an organization of trade unions or shop clerks' unions and should not join trade associations. The right to strike for workers must be recognized because past mediation and arbitration could not restrict the employer's freedom to dismiss or close factories. Workers have no means of self-defense. Student movements were not recognized in the past as having the right to organize student unions. They could not only not participate in political movements, but they could not also interfere in school administration. They had organizations in name only, without any function. The current Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association is a temporary organization used to resist foreign aggression. In the future, the organization of student unions and student federations must be restored. In addition to participating in political movements, their functions should also seek the welfare of students to curb the school authorities from exploiting students under various names to achieve their profit-making goals of commercialized education. In the merchant movement, there is nothing seriously wrong with the current trade associations and chambers of commerce. However, the distinctions of the trade associations are unlimited and have become a disguised form of the guildhall. This should be improved. Moreover, the restrictions on the union of local trade associations or chambers of commerce are too strict and should not exist. Other organizations of self-employed professionals and cultural and social organizations should not have restrictions of one organization per locality. An absolute principle of free organization should be adopted. There are many corrupt elements in the municipal party headquarters, and facts of corruption are often exposed to society, causing laughter both domestically and abroad. Recently, the handling of mass movements has been extremely inappropriate. We also sympathize with the principle of reorganization, but the reorganization must comply with the general charter and the agreement of the majority. If a few people establish various names separately or carry out the organization through the speculative means of transformation by the original members, we are absolutely opposed. All of the above are the results of our collective discussion and are defined as the goals of our struggle in the future. Anyone willing to join forces in common effort is welcome. The current communication address is temporarily set up at No. B426, Route Lafayette, French Concession, to facilitate contact with all parties. The telegram is urgent. We await your clear instructions.</p>
<h3>Yang Jingbin Assumes Position as Director of the Foreign Affairs Discussion Association Yesterday</h3>

Since Yang has been promoted to secretary, the position has been filled by Yang Jingbin, who was appointed by the ministry. Mr. Yang arrived at the office yesterday afternoon to take over and oversee matters. It is also reported that a committee will be convened soon.</p>
<h3>Important Shipping News</h3>
<p>▲ Towing the Ruiyang The Nisshin Kisen's public Yangtze River steamer Ruiyang Maru ran aground on the Wushang Sandbar upstream of Tongzhou, damaging the hull. This was previously reported.

Workers and towing equipment will also be taken along. It is planned to tow the ship back to Shanghai and then enter the shipyard for major repairs.</p>
<p>▲ Progress of Chinese Ships Since the boycott of Japanese ships, the business of British ships in Shanghai has been very prosperous. Chinese merchant ships have been released back to Shanghai by the headquarters, and after restoring scheduled services, cargo and passengers have become even more crowded. Various shipping companies have all made profits. Last month, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's business, after expenses, had a surplus of more than 100,000 taels. After adding new ships this month, the income from freight will be even greater, and the surplus will be even more. In recent days, Guo Waifeng has convened meetings of the heads of various departments to discuss issues such as the bureau's affairs, operations, and economics. The agenda of the meeting is kept secret.</p>

<h3>Weihaiwei Radio Station to Begin Trial Reporting Today</h3>
<p>The International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has added a radio station in Weihaiwei. Since its preparation, it has been nearly four months. Initially, the site leased in that port was insufficient for application. Since changing the location, the radio station has been installed. Recently, the preparations have been completed, and it has been decided to implement trial reporting today (the 20th). It has also been planned to communicate with the Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao, and Jinan areas for trial reporting. The radio station in that port has both longwave and shortwave installations. When the shortwave is officially reported, it will only communicate with the above four ports. However, reporting with various parts of the country will depend on the location, and the four ports will forward the shortwave radio stations. It is the coastal ship reporting service, and the official reporting will be done by the bureau selecting a date and notifying Weihaiwei to handle it. It is said that the date is not far away, at the latest within ten days.</p>

<h3>Wang Songfa, Who Robbed and Killed Three People, Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>▲ Wang Smiled Carelessly After Hearing the Verdict</p>
<p>▲ Asked by What Method He Would Be Executed</p>
<p>Wang Jiasun, a native of Ningbo, owner of the Wang Yuanxing sawmill at No. 1673, East Xihua Road, his wife Zhang, and Yu Xingbao, were murdered at approximately 1:00 AM on the 5th of this month while they were sound asleep in the front building. Wang Songfa, his grand-nephew, planned the crime out of resentment and greed, using a kitchen knife to kill all three of them, stealing 130 silver dollars and a deposit book for the Shanghai Siming Bank with a total of 1,781 yuan, and fleeing to the home of his friend Xie Jinbao in Zhoushanbang, Wuxi. Later, because the stolen money was running out, he falsely told Xie that his grandfather, Wang Jiasun, had passed away and that he had secretly taken a Siming deposit book and asked him to go to Shanghai to collect the money on his behalf. Xie, unaware of the situation and illiterate, accompanied his friend Feng Song to Shanghai to collect the money from the bank, and the case was exposed. Xie Shuiquan, a Chinese detective of the Huishan Police Station, and detectives Qi Mengqing and Liu Baoshan successively arrested them and went to Wuxi to arrest Wang Songfa. The police determined that Feng Song was indeed a legitimate businessman who was temporarily deceived and specially declared to the First Special District Court for preliminary release. Xie Jinbao and Wang Songfa were interrogated by Judge Shen Bingrong on various aspects of the case and were awaiting sentencing. The details have been published in this newspaper. Yesterday morning was the date of the verdict. The police escorted Wang Songfa and related person Xie Jinbao to the First High Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that Xie Jinbao should be released. Wang Jinfeng, the young daughter of the victim, also came to court, saying that the Siming Bank deposit book had been issued by the previous court, but the money had not yet been received. Judge Shen then ruled that Wang Songfa was sentenced to death for premeditated murder, sentenced to death for two counts of murder, and sentenced to one year of imprisonment for theft, all to be carried out by execution. Wang Songfa smiled carelessly after hearing the verdict, saying, "The court sentenced me to death. What method will be used to execute me?" Judge Shen said, "You will know when it is carried out." Xie Jinbao was immediately released, and he declared to the young Wang Jinfeng that the bank deposit would be notified to the bank again to be issued.</p>
<h3>Li Quanlin, Who Murdered and Robbed, Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>▲ The First Death Sentence Judged by the Second Special District Court</p>
<p>▲ His Attitude Was Extremely Terrified Before the Execution</p>
<p>Li Quanlin, a criminal sentenced to death by the Second Special District Court after the French Concession Public Court was taken back, was a native of Wujin. His case involved colluding with Yuan Changsheng and others to rob in the vicinity of Minguo Road and Nanyang Bridge, as well as robbing the Changxing Tobacco and Paper Shop at No. 91 Lanwei Ail Road, and shooting and killing shop employee Gao Ronghua. The French police Chinese detective caught him with a target in the Luoshenfu Road, searched for a pistol and bullets, and escorted him to the Second Special Court. Judge Ge interrogated Li, who confessed without denying, so he was sentenced to death. A petition was submitted to the provincial government for a reply telegram, ordering him to be sent to the Chinese-administered district court for execution. Yesterday morning, the executing judge opened the court and brought Li to the case for identity verification. He was then escorted to the execution ground of the No. 2 Prison in Caohejing by bailiffs and others. Wang Sixian, a prosecutor appointed by the District Court, served as the execution supervisor, along with Secretary Yu, Examiner Shen, etc., and ordered Police Chief Xu Jinqing, Police Officer Chen Xihui, and Supervising Execution Police Xue Bingzhang, Gu Hanqing, Yin Daoxu, Zhu Wanyuan, and Zhang Chunsen, etc., to go to the execution ground. After the judge and Warden Dong took their seats, Li was brought to the case and stated that he was 33 years old, his wife was a wet nurse in Dr. Zhang Long's house on Pingqiao Road, and his father was already 66 years old. He asked to buy a coffin to collect his body, etc. His attitude was extremely terrified, and he could not move. The judge ordered the execution. Police Chief Xu directed the bailiffs to take him down for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Young Man Commits Suicide in Inn</h3>
<p>▲ Signed as Zhang Jianxun, Native of Jiangxi, 31 Years Old</p>
<p>▲ Used a Knife to Stab His Throat, His Life Is Feared to Be In Danger</p>
<p>At around 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a young man dressed in a royal blue Western suit with a thin and long face suddenly arrived at the Andong Inn on Daxin Street, No. 66 Hubei Road. The traveler was carrying a small wicker basket in his right hand and an umbrella in his left arm. He signed his name as Zhang Jianxun, 31 years old, a native of Jiangxi, and a member of the academic community. The inn's accountant led him to room No. 241 on the second floor, agreeing on a daily room rate of 2.86 yuan. The young man first paid 3 silver dollars. At around 9:00 PM that night, the young man took off his coat, leaving only a shirt, and ordered a bowl of winter mushroom noodles from the waiter. After eating, he closed the door tightly, as if going to bed. However, there was a piece of glass in room No. 241, which faced the waiter's counter. One of the waiters suddenly caught a glimpse of fresh red bloodstains on the bed curtain in room No. 241. The waiter was shocked and rushed to open the door. He only saw the young man lying on the bed, with blood flowing profusely from his throat. His right hand was still holding a razor, and a pointed Western knife was also placed beside the bed. It was determined to be a suicide. He immediately reported it to the Laozha Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate carefully. He had not yet died, and he was immediately taken to Tongren Hospital. However, the wound was very deep, and his life was feared to be in danger.</p>
<h3>Refugee Relief Centers Continuously Repatriate Large Numbers of Refugees</h3>
<p>▲ Gaoyou Fellow-Countrymen Association Asks to Continue Accepting Them</p>
<p>▲ Refugee Relief Committee The Shanghai Refugee Relief Committee held its fourth regular meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Qu Wenliu, Hu Hongji (representing Shen Hao), Lu Bohong, Li Yunshu, Wang Binyan, Pan Gongzhan, Feng Liutang, Huang Hanzhi, Lu Shaoze, Gu Junyang, Zhu Qiluo, Wang Yiting, and others attended. Wang Yiting was elected as chairman. The agenda was as follows: (1) Report on the repatriation and relief situation for this week, (2) A case of Gengji Shelter's request for an additional five yuan per square for the refugee shelter sheds it built was resolved by approving an additional one yuan per square, (3) Report on the outline of income and expenditure accounts for this week, (4) The Gaoyou Fellow-Countrymen Association sent a letter stating that refugee representatives and others requested a temporary postponement of repatriation to their original places of origin. It was resolved to reply to the association that the repatriation of refugees by the committee was a form of financial assistance, and since the original places of origin were also handling winter relief after their return, there would definitely not be any starvation.</p>
<p>▲ Repatriation of Large Numbers of Refugees The Shanghai Refugee Relief Center, due to the large number of refugees arriving in Shanghai in recent days, has been financially assisting refugees for repatriation every day since the 16th of this month. On the 16th, 139 refugees were transported by the Datong Company's Zida Ship to Huojiaqiao, Yangzhou. On the 17th, 295 refugees were transported by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianghua Ship to Hankou, Anhui, Wuhu, and Changsha. On the 18th, 201 refugees were transported by the Dada Company's Daqing Ship to Huojiaqiao. On the 19th, 588 refugees were transported by the Sanbei Company's Changan Ship to Hankou. It is reported that all the companies have waived the fares and only charged for food, which is half a yuan per person for those below Zhenjiang and one and a half yuan per person for Anqing and Hankou.</p>
<p>▲ Letter from the Gaoyou Fellow-Countrymen Association The Shanghai Gaoyou Fellow-Countrymen Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Committee, stating: Recently, the refugees Jin Liunan, Zhang Diaobin, and others from the First Refugee Relief Center came to the association and claimed that the refugee relief center is now carrying out the second repatriation. The refugees have no homes to return to and are waiting for death. They are specially reporting this to request assistance. Their voices were tearful, and their situation is truly pitiful. In general, refugees from various places have come here to escape death and seek survival. At this time of severe winter, suddenly repatriating them to their clothing- and food-less hometowns will inevitably lead to nine deaths out of ten, which is no different from driving them into ditches. Moreover, at a time when the country is in great difficulty, taking risks is especially worrying. We still hope that your committee will embrace benevolence, continue to maintain them, and wait until the warm spring to repatriate them to their original places of origin to engage in spring plowing. This will be a thorough rescue of people and will not lose the committee's original charitable intention. We are now recommending that Mr. Yang Kunyue of our association go to see you in person to plead with you. Please immediately grant our request. If you approve, not only will thousands of refugees express their gratitude in unison, but our association will also represent them in bowing nine times to thank you.</p>

<h3>Judgment in the Yi Xin Li Housing Lawsuit</h3>
<p>▲ Tenants Hosted Various Sectors Last Night</p>
<p>▲ It Was Decided on the Spot to Form a Support Association</p>
<p>The houses in the Yi Xin Li area belong to wealthy merchants Cheng Linsheng and Cheng Yize. Recently, the Chengs ordered all tenants to vacate the houses, but the tenants refused, leading to a lawsuit. The Special First District Court has summoned the parties multiple times and concluded the case, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the judgment in this case. The plaintiff's lawyer, Wang Youling, the lawyer for the joined party, Wang Fuchang of the Public Interest and Philanthropic Association, and the defendant's lawyer, Wang Chuanbi, all appeared in court. At 2:30 PM, Judge He Qi ascended the bench in the Civil Division 9 and announced the judgment. The main text of the judgment stated: "The defendants, Taichang Woodware Store and fifteen other businesses, must vacate the houses, and provisional execution is permitted. Rongchangxiang must vacate by March 6, 1932, and provisional execution is permitted. The litigation costs are to be borne by the defendants." Furthermore, the China Photo Studio and Rongchangxiang Western Clothing Store, representing the Yi Xin Li tenants' association, hosted various sectors at the Atlantic Restaurant last night to appeal against the forced eviction. They further stated that the provisional execution judged by the Special District Court yesterday was urgent, and they urgently sought a solution. Hundreds of representatives from various sectors attended the reception last night, and it was decided on the spot to form a support committee to proceed with the matter.</p>
<h3>The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Sues Shen Chengfu Case</h3>
<p>▲ One Matter, Two Lawsuits, Redundant Structure</p>
<p>▲ The Repayment Issue Still Needs to Be Discussed</p>
<p>The British firm Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. filed a lawsuit because the bills of exchange of more than 500,000 yuan paid by its cotton compradore Shen Chengfu were due, and the Zhichang Qianzhuang, which issued the bills, had gone bankrupt and could not be cashed. At that time, Shen Chengfu also abandoned his job and fled. The foreign firm then filed a lawsuit against Shen in the First Special District Court for payment.</p>
<p>Subsequently, it accused Shen of embezzlement in the Criminal Division of the court and also attached a civil lawsuit. The defendant has now been detained. The foreign firm's one matter, two lawsuits is truly a redundant structure. When Judge Guo Shouyi of the Farmer's Division heard the case yesterday, he made many corrections to the plaintiff's prosecution procedure. The general idea was that since the plaintiff had already filed an independent lawsuit regarding the due and uncashable bills of exchange, it should wait for the Civil Division to hear the case. However, in the embezzlement case, there was also an attached civil lawsuit. However, since this case was filed first, it is not subject to another case, and so on. Subsequently, the lawyers for both parties debated, and the defendant Shen Chengfu completely acknowledged the bills of exchange. Since the two sides still needed to discuss the issue of repayment, Judge Guo adjourned the case to the 26th of this month for further review.</p>
<h3>Judgment in Salt Merchant Family Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The case of Zhang Yexiu suing her husband's elder brother, Zhang Shiying, for embezzling property, which was previously appealed by the defendant's lawyer, Zhang Shizhao, to change the ruling, has been reported earlier. This case was heard in court yesterday. After the defendant's lawyer, Zhang Shizhao, debated each point, the reasons were sufficient. The judge announced in court that Zhang Yexiu's accusations of embezzlement were rejected.</p>
<h3>Bao Ziming is Actually Cai Fei</h3>

<p>Bao Ziming, a native of Tongzhou, is 31 years old. He was previously involved in a gang kidnapping case in the French Concession. He was arrested by the French police and sent to the former Public Concession, where he was sentenced to imprisonment after interrogation. Now, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters has learned that the criminal Bao is actually Cai Fei, the leader of the Communist bandits. Therefore, it specifically sent a document to the Second Special District Court, requesting permission to transfer him for interrogation. Yesterday morning, the court sent police to the prison to bring the criminal Bao to the First Court. Judge Zhang Shijie interrogated him, and Yang Fengqi, the inspector of the detective team sent by the headquarters, arrived to transfer him. After Judge Zhang briefly interrogated the defendant, he ordered that Bao Ziming be handed over to the officers from the headquarters to be taken away for interrogation.</p>

<p>▲ Suicide by Poisoning</p>
<p>Zhang Sun, a young woman from Wuxi, was 27 years old and lived at No. 110 Jiangyin Back Street, Xiaosimeng, Nanshi. Her husband, Rong Da, was a leather business man and a opium addict. Because it was inconvenient to smoke opium in the Chinese territory, he rented a pavilion room on the upper floor of the Xiangji Barber Shop at No. 55 Yushun Lane, Dongxin Street, French Concession, as a den. She also went there every afternoon to play and did not return to Nanshi with him until late at night. This became a habit, but she was addicted to flower associations and lost repeatedly, eventually pawning all her jewelry and clothes. Yesterday, her husband scolded her slightly. Afterwards, she became extremely depressed and suddenly had the idea of dying. She took a large amount of Resorcinol and soon became poisoned and beyond rescue. Her husband noticed and took her to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died at around 7 o'clock. Many pawn tickets were found in her pocket, a considerable number.

<p>Reader's Letter</p>
<h3>Opinions on the Student Demonstration Group's Questioning of the Guangdong Committee - Zhang Wuntian</h3>
<p>Seeing the "Domestic Important News" column of Shen Bao, which carries "Student demonstration groups telegraphing to Wang [Jingwei] to transfer to the Guangdong side committee, asking whether the new National Government authorities can declare war on Japan, can recover lost territory, can withdraw from the League of Nations, can punish Zhang Xueliang, if not, then like the original rulers, don't blame the anti-Japanese masses for treating you the same..." I couldn't help but itch to say a few words. Before speaking, I want to state that I am not a student, nor a member of any party, nor a pawn of any organization or individual. I am completely an ordinary citizen speaking from the standpoint of jointly facing the national crisis. No one can deny the mistakes of the previous authorities in handling national affairs. In the past few days, the situation has taken a sharp turn, and the new authorities have been replaced. Whether they can, as we fervently hope and as they have stated, save the precarious China, whether they can do it, cannot be predicted now. We should actively offer opinions to the new authorities, and criticize and supervise them. At the same time, we must encourage the courage of the new authorities, hold on to the original propositions, and fight to the end without any hesitation. We should not come and give them a blow to the head, making them discouraged. The wording of the student demonstration group's telegram completely loses the above-mentioned spirit and attitude, which cannot but make us suspicious under ardent sympathy. First, in China's current situation and environment, and the general level of political life of the masses, the domestic and foreign propositions now stated by the new authorities are needed. Whether they can be implemented will naturally be questioned in the future. The tone of the student demonstration group seems to have an attitude of distrust. This distrust is due to the propositions of the new authorities, or the individual members of the new authorities, is not known. If it is said to be a proposition, then the foreign propositions are no different from those of the demonstration group, and the demonstration group has not seen any other propositions for the domestic situation. If it is said to be due to the individual members of the new authorities, then why not point them out? Second, the central issue of anti-Japanese resistance is how to recover lost territory without harming national interests. The issues of declaring war on Japan, withdrawing from the League of Nations, and punishing Zhang Xueliang (I propose that this should be decided after the Northeast Incident comes to an end) all revolve around this issue. As for whether the new authorities can recover the lost territory, it is determined by whether the new authorities and the national masses can work together in the future. At this moment, no omnipotent government or individual can have a definite answer, unless you ask them whether they have the determination to recover the lost territory. Third, seeking the victory of anti-Japanese resistance must seek the human track of internal affairs. This principle is certainly true, but anti-Japanese efforts cannot be weakened because of domestic issues. At present, most of the actions of the general students belong to the domestic affairs. For the recovery of lost territory and the declaration of war on Japan, I have not seen any practical and painstaking preparation work. It is as if the huge anti-Japanese work is entirely the responsibility of the government, and nothing needs to be done without a virtuous government. This concept is a big mistake. To be honest, we are relatively implicit in the current changes in the situation. Whether it is reliable in the future is not yet to be discussed. At present, we should, on the one hand, do some preparations for the recovery of lost territory very hard, very practically, and with a plan, and on the other hand, encourage the courage of the new authorities, hold on to the original propositions, and fight to the end, and at the same time, add strict criticism and supervision. We should not passively question, blame, or even threaten turmoil. In the past few years, the political disturbances in the country have made the general masses and young students sink to a terrible level. This time, due to the crisis of the national foundation, the phenomenon of gradual activity is truly valuable. It is also a mistake not to add encouragement and supervision to this valuable active situation of the Chinese people. I have seen the actions and words of students and demonstration groups in the past few days, and they often deviate from the original intention of resisting Japan and saving the country, so I have these words. I hope that the student demonstration group will work hard and move forward based on its original intention, and do not mess up the pace or lose the sympathy of students across the country and the general public. At the same time, I hope that the new government authorities can implement the original propositions and accept the opinions, criticisms, and supervision of the people. The patience and ardent hopes of the people are all in this move, and only in this move. The time is not to be missed again.</p>
<p>(Reply) It is too early to criticize the new authorities now, or to trust the new authorities now. This matter all depends on whether the new authorities can immediately announce a few fundamental facilities to show the people a new beginning when they first come to power. Threatening turmoil is certainly not appropriate, but reasonable questioning and blame are also a kind of supervisory role. If the new authorities sincerely want to comfort the people's aspirations, they can answer frankly because of their questioning.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Respectfully, I have just read in your esteemed newspaper of December 19th a telegram from Zhang Zhijiang to Chen Jitang, which I find most surprising. Upon investigation, Jiang and Mr. Chen have never had any official superior-subordinate relationship. The form of address in the telegram is completely inappropriate and clearly a fabrication. I am therefore writing to request that you publish a correction. Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Respectfully, Zhang Zhijiang, to the Chief Editor of Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Esteemed Editor, regarding the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's exhibition of achievements in patriotic activities of primary and secondary schools, upon receiving the Bureau's notice, our school actively prepared for registration, completed the report forms, and completed all procedures according to the Bureau's stipulated date. On the afternoon of the 11th (the day before the exhibition), at 2:00 PM, we sent personnel to Wu Ben Middle School (as the newspaper reported that the first venue was Wu Ben, and our school was listed in the first venue), to report to the preparatory committee office and inquire about the display location. The first reply from Director Zhong stated that it was on the second floor of the new building, number two. Unexpectedly, number two belonged to Guang Zhao Middle School. At that time, our school thought that Mr. Zhong was mistaken, so we returned to the office to explain the school name. Mr. Zhong searched through the papers he held, but said there was no name of our school, and that our school's registration procedures were incorrect. Our school repeatedly explained that the registration procedures were definitely not wrong, and that the newspaper and the signs posted outside the venue also had the name of our school, which could prove it. However, Mr. Zhong still did not acknowledge that our school was registered. After our school's repeated statements, Mr. Zhong pointed to the two playgrounds as display rooms. At the same time, several schools had already displayed their materials in the two playgrounds, and our school had many charts and graphs, which were insufficient in space. After much negotiation, Mr. Shao then led us to the girls' embroidery room of the school. Our school prepared to display, but unexpectedly, the school authorities said that this place was not designated for display and could not be approved. So our school could not display again. We contacted Mr. Zhong again, and Mr. Zhong kept saying "wait a little, wait a little, there will be a solution." But that day was the anniversary of the "Four Weeks of Common Calamity", and Shanghai was under special martial law. Our school, from 2:00 PM to after 5:00 PM, still had no place to display, and had no choice but to bring back all the original achievements, resulting in a futile trip. This is the true situation of the day's events. Now, because colleagues, friends, and students' families have asked our school why we had the name of participating but did not see the reality of participating, we have not been able to reply to each one. We respectfully request that you use the "Letters to the Editor" column of your esteemed newspaper to publish the above-mentioned facts to clarify the truth. We are extremely hopeful. Sincerely, Shanghai Guangdong Private Primary and Secondary School.</p>
<p>Respectfully, I have just read a news item in the local news column of today's newspaper, "Municipal Ferry Increases Fares." Upon investigation, the Bureau has adjusted the ferry fares this time according to the actual measured distances of each pier, and re-determined them. Among them, some are higher than the current prices, and some are lower. If, as the title of your newspaper shows, it seems that there are only increases and no decreases, it is somewhat inconsistent with the facts. I am writing to inform you, hoping for your consideration. To the Editorial Department of Shen Bao, from the First Section of the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, December 18th.</p>
<p>Respectfully, I have read in today's newspaper's local news column a news item about the takeover and reorganization of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union by pharmaceutical workers. The facts are completely inconsistent, and it is very misleading to read. The details of the matter are as follows: yesterday morning at 9:30 (i.e., 9:30 AM on the 18th), unemployed members Chen Xuetang, Qi Jinxian, Fang Zheng, Kong Baogen, Dong Xingfa, etc., led a small number of unemployed and local ruffians, dozens of people, into the office of our union. Their momentum was fierce, claiming to be here to take over and reorganize, etc. They smashed the tables, chairs, and utensils, and stole documents, seals, and other items. Zhao Zhenhui, a member of the standing committee of our union, saw that the situation was not good and that there was no reason to reason. He reported to the Third Branch of the First District of the Public Security Bureau. The police were dispatched to the scene and detained Fang Zheng and others for questioning (at this time, the remaining accomplices had fled without a trace). Zhao Zhenhui, a member of the standing committee of our union, did not want to investigate further, so the director of the office released them after reprimanding them. This is the accurate account of what happened at that time. I am therefore writing to request a correction, and I ask that you publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column to correct the record and reveal the truth. To the Chief Editor of Shen Bao, from the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, December 19th.</p>
<p>Respectfully, I have just read today's (December 19th) local news column of your esteemed newspaper, "Today's City-Wide Congress of Trade Union Representatives," which lists the "Fourth District Silk Filature Workers' Union." Upon investigation, our union was unaware of being listed as a convener of this congress of trade union representatives, and has not recently sent anyone to participate in any external activities. We are deeply afraid of misunderstandings from the outside world, so we are writing to request that your esteemed newspaper grant a correction. To the Editing Department of Shen Bao, sincerely from the Shanghai Fourth District Silk Filature Industrial Union, December 19th.</p>
<p>Respectfully, upon examining the "Trade Union News" column of the 16th of this month, the agenda of the 12th meeting of the board of directors of the Knitting Industry Union is completely inconsistent, does not specify the district number, and much of the content is absurd, and should be declared invalid immediately. I am writing to inform you specifically, asking you to make corrections on our behalf. I am extremely grateful. To the Great Editor, Wang Yuanqi, Standing Supervisor of the First District Knitting Industry Union, Tang Shichang and Tang Shixin, Directors of the Board, December 19th.</p>
<p>Respectfully, regarding the news item in the local news column of your esteemed newspaper of the 16th of this month concerning the Special District Court's wanted notice for Ma Zhichao, which mentions Director Ma Xiaojun, I am extremely surprised. Upon investigation, this case has nothing to do with Ma Xiaojun. Ma is a soldier and does not belong to the jurisdiction of the Special District Court. On that day, my lawyer appeared in court on my behalf to explain and present proof. Therefore, the details in your newspaper are completely inconsistent with the facts. I am writing to request a corresponding correction to clarify the truth and protect my reputation. To the Shen Bao, from lawyer Chen Zemin, December 18th.</p>
<p>Respectfully, having read the article on the fifteenth page of the fourth section of your esteemed newspaper on the sixteenth of this month, within the local news column, an article was published titled, The Special Zone Court Orders the Arrest of Ma Zhichao, etc. Within it, it stated, After the closure of the Sino-American Bank, yesterday, thirty-nine creditors of the company, including Huang Cun Seng, filed a complaint with the First Court of the Special Zone, accusing Ma Zhichao and I of jointly committing fraud. At the preliminary hearing yesterday, none of the defendants were present. The plaintiff's agent, lawyer Tang Huaiqun, earnestly requested the issuance of an arrest warrant, which was approved." Upon investigation, on the day of the hearing, I was ill and unable to get up, and I had extended an invitation to lawyer Shan Yuhua to appear in court to make a statement. Shan reported that he had learned that the plaintiff Huang Cun Seng represented thirty-nine people in filing the lawsuit, but there were no letters of entrustment, and the circumstances were bizarre. The court ordered that formal procedures be supplemented before a summons would be issued. There was no issuance of an arrest warrant. This is completely inconsistent with what your newspaper reported. Since the Sino-American lawsuit occurred, many slanderers have fabricated facts and confused the public. I do not wish to comment on their intentions at this time. I believe that since the matter involves litigation, it should await legal resolution. However, the overturning of right and wrong requires a reckoning. Therefore, I am writing to earnestly request that you make a correction to clarify the truth. This is my sincere hope. To the gentlemen of the editing department, respectfully, Li Henian, 381 Xin Da Gu Road, British Concession, October 19th.</p>
<p>Respectfully, regarding the news item in your newspaper of the 19th of this month regarding a dispute in the City Chamber of Commerce, which states that Chen Zhiying, Liu Musu, and Sun Choucheng went one after another to notify the staff of the Chamber of Commerce and explain the reasons for the takeover, I am very surprised to read it. Upon investigation, on that day, Choucheng wanted to inquire about the wholesale price of Snow Flower Cream, a small product from Chinese and Western pharmacies, from Sun Feijun, a staff member of the Finance Section of the Chamber of Commerce, so he sent the articles of association. On the second floor, he met Xu Qianlin, who had a letter requesting the Chamber of Commerce to certify the goods. He wanted to accompany him to the Document Department to explain the situation, so he went with Xu to the Document Department. Shortly after, Liu Musu arrived and announced the reasons for the takeover in public. The Public Security Bureau immediately sent patrols to the meeting to maintain order and prevent people from entering or leaving. Therefore, Choucheng did not return until after 4:00 PM. The newspaper reporter saw Choucheng also at the Chamber of Commerce that day and mistakenly thought that he was there for the takeover, which led to this misreporting. I am writing to request a correction to clarify the facts. This is my sincere hope. To the Chief Editor, from Sun Choucheng.</p>
