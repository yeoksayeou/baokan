<p>然德政府之得最後勝利與日政府之得最後勝利略有不同德政府之得最後勝利全然外交上應付得宜使處於艱難困苦中之德國得於不屈不抗中受國際之歡迎并能於最後之時成立德奥關稅協定雖尚有國外之反對而得國内之同情不少是德政府之得最後勝利全由於政府本身之能力有以成之也至於日政府之得最後勝利則由於敵黨以前執政之無能及此屆攻擊政府之能力薄弱徒取政府之代理總理以及總理之健康問題并代理總理失言問題等種種瑣碎之事以爲攻擊之具不適用於世界現有之潮流其不能推倒政府亦固其所非全關於議會中黨員之多少也故日政府得最後勝利全由於敵黨成之也</p>

<h3>Implementation Procedures for Party Representatives Elections by Kuomintang</h3>

<p>Nanjing. The National Election Headquarters telegraphed the General Supervisors and Supervisors of Elections in various provinces on the 27th to explain the implementation procedures for the election of representatives of the Chinese Kuomintang as follows: (1) Since the election of party representatives has its own implementation procedures, it is not necessary to create and send registers, and it is not necessary to go through the procedures of review and announcement. The qualifications of electors shall be handled by the party departments in accordance with the party's internal election practices. In mixed election areas, the party departments shall be responsible for receiving election tickets from the election supervisors according to the number of party members and issuing them to party members for voting, and it is not necessary to create and send registers. (2) The ballot papers shall be made and distributed by the election office, and the ballot boxes shall be provided by the district divisions. (3) The number of party members convened by the district divisions when holding elections is not limited to the statutory number. (4) If any malpractice is found in the election of party representatives, it shall be investigated and tried by the Supervisory Committee or the Supervisory Committee members. (5) According to the provisions of Article 6 of the Implementation Procedures, half or more than half of the representatives of each province should be elected from the candidates submitted by the central government, and the rest should be freely elected by the electors. For example, if the number of representatives of a certain province in this party is five, then three of them should be produced from the candidates designated by the central government. If the result of the election is that the number of votes obtained by the candidates designated by the central government are all above the other general candidates, whether all five people are elected by the candidates designated by the central government or only three can be elected, and the other two must be elected by those with more votes outside. On the contrary, if the number of votes obtained by the candidates designated by the central government is still below the fifth place of those directly elected, whether the number of votes obtained by the candidates designated by the candidates is still the same, if all of them are above the general candidates, all of them in the top five can be elected, if the number of votes obtained by the candidates is below the fifth place of those directly elected, then in addition to the first two names of those directly elected, the remaining three should still be the candidates with more votes.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Closure of the Parliaments of Germany and Japan</h3>
<p>The parliaments of Germany and Japan have both closed. The results can be said to be victories for the government after being severely challenged. When the parliaments of the two countries opened and in the midst of political debates, the governments were in precarious situations. The opposition from the opposing parties and the movement to overthrow the cabinet were advancing rapidly, and it was indeed fortunate for the governments of the two countries that they were able to barely overcome the difficulties.</p>
<p>However, the final victory of the German government and the final victory of the Japanese government are slightly different. The final victory of the German government was entirely due to its proper handling of diplomacy, allowing Germany, which was in difficult and distressed circumstances, to receive international welcome without resistance. And it was able to finally conclude the German-Austrian customs union agreement. Although there is still opposition from abroad, it has received a lot of sympathy from the country. The final victory of the German government was entirely due to the government's own ability to achieve it. As for the final victory of the Japanese government, it was due to the incompetence of the opposition party when it was in power before and the weak ability of this year's attack on the government. It only took various trivial matters such as the Acting Prime Minister of the government and the health problems of the Prime Minister, as well as the problem of the Acting Prime Minister's slip of the tongue, as tools for attack, which are not applicable to the current trend of the world. Its failure to overthrow the government is also solid, and it is not entirely related to the number of party members in the parliament. Therefore, the final victory of the Japanese government was entirely due to the opposition party.</p>

<h3>All India Congress Approves Gandhi-Irwin Pact</h3>

<p>Great Riot in Cawnpore</p>
<p>More Than 600 Killed and Wounded</p>
<p>Reuter, Karachi, 27th: The Working Committee of the All India Congress today passed several important resolutions: (1) Approving the Gandhi-Irwin Pact; (2) Declaring that the aim of the All India Congress is Indian independence; (3) Demanding complete jurisdiction over army, foreign affairs, financial and economic policies; (4) Electing Gandhi as chief representative of the All India Congress to the Round Table Conference. Other resolutions included demanding the total release of political prisoners and recognizing Burma's right to self-determination.</p>
<p>Reuter, Karachi, 26th: Gandhi spoke for about an hour today at the All India Congress venue, where tens of thousands of listeners were silent as if under a spell. Gandhi's speech included phrases such as "No one can hurt me. If heaven grants me years, I will serve India. Yesterday, young friends shouted to overthrow Gandhism and its believers. They will never die even if I die." Gandhi referred to an incident yesterday when he passed through Malir on his way to Karachi, and a young man presented him with a black cloth flower. Gandhi said today that if the young man comes to admit his mistake, he can return the flower to him.</p>
<p>Reuter, Karachi, 26th: Gandhi is prepared to decide his next steps based on the votes of the All India Congress. Gandhi sat in front of his spinning wheel at the door of his small house and spoke with several reporters, saying that if the All India Congress rejects the solution he reached with Irwin, then he would have no choice but to temporarily withdraw from political life, as such a rejection would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence. If it is approved, he does not want to accept the unlimited mandate given to him by the All India Congress to attend the Round Table Conference; he wants to obtain a limited mandate to establish the conditions for Indian independence and guarantees.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 26th: Today, the entire German populace, united in outrage at the attacks on the German-Austrian customs union by neighboring countries, vowed to support the government and resist the aggression of the powers. This surge in public morale has not been seen in recent years. Chancellor Brüning's refusal to submit the text of the agreement to the League of Nations</p>
<p>is very much in line with public sentiment.

<h3>Aviation Floating Station to Be Built Soon</h3>
<p>All Equipment Will Be Available</p>
<p>Prototype Completed, on Public Display</p>
<p>Associated Press, New York, 26th: Inventor Armstrong exhibited a prototype of a common aviation floating station today. It is said that construction will begin in April, first building one 250 miles off the coast of the United States towards Bermuda, and then adding sections towards Europe to allow airplanes to cross the Atlantic safely. Each station will have hotels, hangars, machine shops, fuel depots, and, in short, all the equipment necessary for flying across the Atlantic. These aircraft stations will be built here and then towed to the desired location. All airplanes wishing to stop will be charged according to grade. According to Armstrong's projections, this project is expected to be profitable. Armstrong has been planning this project for many years. The difficulty lies not in the construction but in anchoring it in the sea to withstand the impact of strong winds and waves. A good method has now been devised, so construction is beginning.</p>
<h3>British Upper House Inquires About Slavery in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Reuter, London, 26th: The Upper House inquired about slavery in Hong Kong. Cabinet member Bathfield replied that the claim that the Hong Kong government condones slavery is absolutely untrue. According to the latest reports, the number of female servants in Hong Kong has been reduced to 4,117. Those who violate the new chapter on suppressing the abuse of female servants are punished. It is hoped that the system of keeping female servants will be eliminated within a few years. As for the layer of dead children found in the streets, it is unrelated to the system of keeping female servants. There are many Chinese in Hong Kong, and it is impossible to monitor their burial of dead children. The government is trying to prevent the evil practice of abandoning corpses in the streets. It is not uncommon to find abandoned corpses in the streets of densely populated cities that have been populated for many years. Even in London, the number of abandoned corpses found each year is not small.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Plans to Develop Four Mines</h3>
<p>Industry Minister Kong Xiangxi recently submitted a plan to develop four types of minerals – petroleum, gold, copper, and coal – requesting appropriations for implementation. The Central Political Conference deliberated on the 25th and resolved to submit it to the Executive Yuan for consideration. Excerpts of the plan are as follows:</p>
<p>Petroleum (A. Reason): In recent years, imports have reached 80 million yuan annually, while our country has abundant oil fields in Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Xikang, and Guizhou. After exploitation, it will not only be sufficient for self-sufficiency but also avoid huge leakage. (B. Location): The oil zone in northern Shaanxi stretches approximately over 1,000 li from north to south and about 600 li from east to west. The known sites include Yanchang, Fushi, and Yanchuan. Yanchang is 900 li from the provincial capital and 180 li from the Yellow River. Fushi is 150 li west of Yanchang, and Yanchuan is 120 li north of Yanchang. It is currently planned to drill 40 oil wells in Yanchang and 30 wells each in Yanchuan and Fushi, establishing a transportation hub at the Getanzhen beachhead on the Yellow River crossing. From Getanzhen to Tongguan is approximately 700 li. (C. Budget): The initial expenses for opening new roads and repairing existing ones, as well as drilling wells and purchasing machinery, amount to over 2.13 million yuan. Recurring expenses and working capital are separate.</p>
<p>(II) Gold Mines (A. Reason): The recent surge in gold prices has caused particular distress in our country and is difficult to resolve. We should reserve cash in preparation for adopting the gold standard. However, gold production has decreased. In the past 20 years, the annual output has declined from 200,000 taels to around 100,000 taels. It is not easy to mine gold on a large scale now. A pragmatic approach is to mine alluvial gold sand, improving mining and panning methods. (B. Location): Heilongjiang, Jilin, Sichuan, Xikang, and Xinjiang, especially Heilongjiang, are rich in gold. The Ministry of Industry has already dispatched personnel to investigate three locations: 1. Heihe Gold Mine: Exploring the Xing'anling area, the gold-bearing sand layer southwest of Wudaogou to the upper reaches of Niqiao River is 2 to 4 chi thick and approximately 4 to over 10 zhang wide. 2. Shiwei Gold Mine: Four gold deposits have been discovered on the east bank of the Ergun River: (a) Zigou in Jilin is 3 li long, (b) Gupigou is 7 li long, (c) Yilijidina is over 100 li long, (d) Jigajugou is over 30 li long. 3. Yilan Gold Mine: The Donggou area is particularly notable, about 60 li long. (C. Budget): Due to the remote locations and sparse population, modern equipment is not readily available. It is proposed to use panning and mercury amalgamation methods, incorporating improved manual methods. Initial expenses: 1. Heihe Gold Mine: 563,000 yuan; 2. Shiwei Gold Mine: 445,000 yuan; 3. Yilan Gold Mine: 386,000 yuan; totaling 1,394,000 yuan. Recurring expenses and working capital are not included.</p>
<p>(III) Copper (A. Reason): Copper mining is stipulated as a national enterprise. Currently, copper is imported from foreign countries, and we should prepare for self-sufficiency. However, the notable copper-producing regions in the country are all in locations with inconvenient transportation. Engaging in mining and smelting may result in excessively high costs. Therefore, it is planned based on the principles of both needs and economy. (B. Location): Yunnan, Sichuan, and the Yangtze River area all produce copper. However, transportation is inconvenient. A trial mining operation was conducted in Daye and Yangxin ten years ago, but it was suspended due to financial constraints and insufficient coking coal. It is now proposed to nationalize and continue the following areas: 1. Longjiaoshan, 30 li from Daye County, is a sulfur copper mine with a copper content of 1.5 to 2 percent. 2. Ouyangshan, 45 li from the city, mainly consists of new sulfur copper ore, chalcocite, and hematite, with a copper content of 4 to 5 percent. 3. Chima Mountain, 45 li from Daye City, has the same mineral composition as Ouyangshan, with mineral veins exposed for 5 li in length and 1 zhang in width. (C. Budget): Establishing a copper smelting plant by Daye Lake and building a light railway. Initial expenses: A. 303,000 yuan, B. 594,000 yuan, C. 434,000 yuan, D. Copper smelting plant, 1,000,000 yuan, totaling 2,331,000 yuan. Recurring expenses and working capital are not included.</p>
<p>(IV) Coal (A. Reason): Omitted. (B. Location): Jiagou near the Lieshan Coal Mine is located northwest of the Lieshan Mine in Sixian County, Anhui, on a plain 50 li from the Fuliji Railway Station. The trial mining results are favorable. 1. The exploitable area spans 10,000 chi (3,300 meters) east-west and 3,000 chi (1,000 meters) north-south. 2. The coal consists of eight layers, all coking bituminous coal. 3. The upper and lower major layers are both exploitable. 4. The upper layer is 7-8 chi to 18-19 chi thick, averaging 13 chi. The lower layer averages 16 chi. The two layers are separated by 500 chi. 5. The coal seams run east-west and slope northward, averaging 13 degrees. 6. The upper wall of the coal seams is directly integrated and contains five layers of sandstone and shale, mostly covered by 100-200 chi of quicksand and over 100 li of loess. 7. The lower wall of the coal seams consists of five layers of sandstone and shale, with thick layers of limestone. 8. The estimated coal reserves, if excavated to a depth of 1,000 chi, are 22,800,000 tons. 9. The exploitable lifespan, at a daily output of 1,500 tons, is estimated at 50 years. (C. Budget): Road construction and mine machinery, etc. (based on a daily coal output of 2,000 tons of equipment), mine shafts, and tunnels, etc., total 3,373,000 yuan. Recurring expenses and working capital are not included.</p>

<h3>News from Guangdong Concerning the Political Turmoil in Yunnan</h3>
<p>News of Long Yun Returning to Kunming to Suppress</p>
<p>Lu Han, Zhu Xu, and Others Send Telegram Endorsing Long Yun</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Yunnan Province recently experienced political turmoil. After Central Committee member Wang Boling passed through Guangdong and rushed back to Yunnan, a telegram was sent to Guangdong stating that he had arrived in Yunnan and that the Yunnan issue would not be difficult to resolve. In recent days, the Yunnan Provincial Office in Guangdong and Yunnan compatriots in Guangdong have received telegrams from Yunnan stating that Long Yun has returned to Kunming to preside over everything, and the provincial turmoil has completely subsided. Additionally, Yunnan General Lu Han and others sent a telegram on the 19th with the following text: "To the Yunnan Guildhall in Guangzhou, for transmission to the fellow provincials in Guangdong: Since Tang Jiyao took power in Yunnan, employing unsuitable individuals for personal gain, colluding with warlords, and opposing the principles of the late Premier Sun, the province has suffered from endless wars, impoverishing the people and exhausting the resources. The military and civilians throughout the province have endured unbearable hardship, leading to the reforms of February 6, 1927. Unexpectedly, after February 6th, evil was not eradicated, and Wang [illegible] and others took the opportunity to instigate the June 14th Hu-Zhang Incident. Furthermore, last year, the army embarked on a righteous campaign to suppress the rebellion, but Meng, Zhang, Hu, and others rebelled and colluded with the traitor Zhang Ruji, disrupting the rear. All of this is clear evidence of the remnants of the Tang faction causing disaster in Yunnan. Now that Hu, Zhang, Meng, and others have been eliminated one after another, Tang Jilin, Zhang [illegible], and Sun [illegible] are still remnants of the Tang faction. The government, considering that they possess some skills, was unwilling to let them remain idle and instead gave them positions to encourage them to strive for improvement. However, these remnants have failed to repent, forming factions for personal gain. Taking advantage of Tang's rebellion, they colluded with reactionaries. Tang Jilin secretly plotted to train troops with the intention of seizing military and political power to act as internal support. Zhang [illegible] employed Tang's followers and other villains as henchmen. Sun [illegible] incited troops, causing disunity and undermining morale. With such evil individuals working together, not only will Yunnan be poisoned, but the Party and the nation will also be endangered. Han and others, bearing the heavy responsibility of the country and being the support of the people of Yunnan, cannot remain silent. Therefore, on March 12th, we telegraphed the National Government requesting the dismissal and punishment of Tang Jilin and others. Esteemed gentlemen, respecting your ancestral homes and being highly regarded by the people of the province, you undoubtedly deeply loathe these remnants. We earnestly request that you report this matter to the Central Government nearby, urging them to swiftly dismiss and punish them to eliminate the traitors and prevent future troubles. The people of Yunnan will truly benefit from this. Chairman Long, whose contributions to the Party and the nation are undeniable, and Han and others have long shared life and death, are determined to wholeheartedly support him to the end. We fear that rumors from afar may be inaccurate and cause misunderstandings. We hope that you will provide detailed explanations to dispel doubts. We respectfully report this by telegram. Lu Han, Zhu Xu, Zhang Fengchun, Zhang Chong, jointly bowing respectfully." (March 23)</p>
<h3>Settlement of the "Great Canton" Case in Shantou</h3>
<p>French Side Fulfils Punishment of Murderer, Apologizes, and Offers Compensation</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: In the case of the French ship "Great Canton," which arrived in Shantou from Saigon on October 3rd of last year, where the shipowner, Luc, beat the inn employee Cai Yuqin to death, various circles in Shantou, filled with righteous indignation, organized a support association for the tragic case, boycotting the ships of the French South China Sea Company from sailing to Shantou and Saigon, and put forward four demands: (1) Punish the murderer; (2) Apologize; (3) Compensate the families of the dead and injured, and pay medical expenses; (4) The French Consul guarantees that similar incidents will not occur in the future. After several negotiations between the Municipal Government and the French Consul, the two sides were close to an agreement. However, there were still disputes over the amount of compensation, and the French Consul refused to fulfill the conditions on the pretext that our side had not lifted the boycott, causing the case to remain unresolved for a long time. Recently, the French side, fearing that the losses would increase due to the prolonged boycott, sent representatives on the 21st of this month to continue negotiations. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, a meeting was held on the third floor of the Municipal Government. Our representatives were Wu Xiaomei, Guan Meisheng, and Zheng Shouren; the French representatives were Gao Hua and Gao Chengqing. In addition to reaffirming the apology and guarantee proposed by our side last year, that similar incidents would not occur in the future, the French side only discussed the issue of the compensation amount. As a result, it was agreed that the French side would compensate 10,500 yuan. Our side also expressed its agreement, and the contract was signed as follows: "March 21, 1931, the 20th year of the Republic of China. The representatives of the Shantou Municipal Government, Wu Xiaomei, Guan Meisheng, and Zheng Shouren, and the representatives of the French Consulate in Shantou, Gao Hua and Gao Chengqing, have consulted in accordance with Article 4 of the agreement reached on November 3rd of last year to resolve the 'Great Canton' case. After proper consultation, the representatives of both parties have decided as follows: (1) The Chinese and French representatives have agreed that the South China Sea Shipping Company will pay compensation of 5,500 yuan for the casualties in this case. In addition, the French representatives will raise another 5,000 yuan, totaling 10,500 yuan in silver dollars. The Chinese representatives have expressed their agreement. (2) Once this agreement is signed by the representatives, it shall be submitted by both parties to the local officials for earnest implementation of the agreement (referring to the one signed on November 3rd of last year, the contents of which have not yet been announced by the Municipal Government) to express goodwill. (3) This agreement is made in four copies, with each party holding two copies as evidence." The negotiations for this case have now been completely resolved. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Boycott of Foreign Ships in Shantou</h3>
<p>Due to Foreign Ships Jointly Increasing Passenger Ticket Prices</p>
<p>Shantou Municipal Government Requests the Abolition of the Shipping Association</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Shantou is one of the southern ports of China for foreign trade. Those from over forty counties in the border areas of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong who go abroad must pass through Shantou. According to customs statistics, the number of people who went abroad from Shantou last year was about 118,000, with two-thirds going to Singapore and then to various ports in the British and Dutch East Indies to engage in industry and commerce. However, last year, the prices of rubber and tin in the British colonies fell, and the number of unemployed Chinese workers reached a huge number. The Dutch colonies have also promulgated new import regulations, stipulating that from April 1st of this year, Chinese who go to the Dutch colonies must first pay 150 guilders in Dutch currency as a landing tax, and then pay 8 guilders per person per year in head tax. As a result, unemployed Chinese workers have virtually no foothold in Southeast Asia, and every month, large numbers of unemployed overseas Chinese are detained and repatriated to Chaozhou and Shantou, and then transferred to their original home villages via Guangdong and Hong Kong. On the 17th, the Wanfushi ship arrived in Shantou from Singapore, carrying 600 repatriated overseas Chinese. Four hundred were from Guangdong and Zhaoqing and had already disembarked in Hong Kong. One hundred and eighty were from Chaozhou and Meizhou and disembarked in Shantou, all looking emaciated. Another 20-plus were from Fujian and were heading to Xiamen. This one instance shows the recent situation in Southeast Asia. Under these circumstances, foreign shipping companies, such as Taikoo, Nam Kie, Boning, Wo Feng, and Taixin, citing the increase in gold prices, have increased the price of passenger tickets to Southeast Asia. The Shantou Travel Industry Association and other six organizations took the lead in launching a protest. The Municipal Government sent personnel to mediate, advocating for a discretionary increase of four yuan. However, because the opinions of the two sides were too far apart, no results were achieved. Since March 1st, most of those who went abroad from Shantou have gone via Hong Kong and Xiamen, and the four companies have also formed an alliance in Shantou to not sell passenger tickets, boycotting each other. On the 17th, various circles convened a conference at the Municipal Party Headquarters and established the "Committee to Oppose Foreign Shipping Price Increases," electing the seven travel organizations as committee members to be responsible for handling affairs. In the name of the conference, a notice was issued to internal and external ports that the ships of the four companies of Taikoo, Taixin, Wo Feng, and Boning, which travel to and from various ports, would stop dropping off passengers and cargo in Shantou from the 20th. Those arriving from foreign ports would also stop picking up passengers and cargo from April 5th. The conference also telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting negotiations with the British Minister to abolish the restrictions imposed by the Singapore government on the entry of overseas Chinese, and requested the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send ships to sail on the Shantou-Singapore route as soon as possible. At the same time, a telegram was sent to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, reporting all the circumstances.</p>
<p>The Shantou Municipal Government also telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government today, requesting the abolition of the Shantou Shipping Association because four of the seven shipping companies in the association belong to foreign merchants, and the alliance to raise prices this time was entirely orchestrated by the association.

<h3>No Grain Shortage in Jiangsu, Adding Grain Tax to Unreported Cultivated Land</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance issued instructions to various counties, ordering them to issue a circular regarding the matter of surveying unreported cultivated land in Jiangsu Province. The number of abandoned farmland acres in various counties of Jiangsu Province is very high, and the difference between actual cultivated farmland and old official records is quite significant between counties. This type of abandoned farmland has been cultivated for a long time. However, due to the protection of local bullies and the control of clerks, it is used as a source of profit, resulting in unreported cultivated land. This is in serious violation of the principle of reorganizing land taxes in this province, and it is necessary to carry out a thorough reorganization. The Department has drafted regulations for surveying unreported cultivated land in Jiangsu Province, adding grain tax, and increasing land grades, and has submitted them for review and discussion. Now, the 380th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee has resolved to pass these regulations, which should be implemented quickly and actively in order to reorganize and increase revenue. In addition to distributing them, the County Magistrates are hereby ordered to assist in their implementation without delay. This order is hereby issued. The regulations for surveying unreported cultivated land in Jiangsu Province, adding grain tax, and increasing land grades are appended below: (Article 1) The scope of the survey of civil wasteland in various counties shall be based on the old amount recorded in the Register of Taxes and Labor Services or the County Gazetteer. Any land outside the old amount that has not been cultivated shall be treated as official wasteland and shall be dealt with in accordance with the regulations on official property. (Article 2) The civil wasteland in various counties shall be inspected by the Finance Bureau together with the clerks, according to the old amount in the Register of Taxes and Labor Services, and the investigation shall be conducted according to the map. The total area of each district shall be measured first, and then the investigation shall be conducted according to the map. Five measures shall be formulated separately for adding grain tax, adding price, reporting reclamation, and increasing land grades. The investigation shall be completed within six months, and all those who are found shall be punished. (Article 3) Those who have cultivated civil wasteland with owners shall be limited to those who have red deeds and old receipts as proof. In the old counties of Suzhou, each mu shall pay four yuan of hidden grain tax. In the old counties of Ningbo, each mu shall pay two yuan of hidden grain tax. Those whose reporting of reclamation has been registered and has not yet expired shall be exempt from paying the hidden grain tax. (Article 4) Those who have cultivated civil wasteland without owners shall be allowed to pay the wasteland price by the original cultivators, and local bullies and clerks shall not be allowed to impersonate them. In the old counties of Suzhou, each mu shall pay four yuan of wasteland price. In the old counties of Ningbo, each mu shall pay one yuan of wasteland price. The payment of the hidden grain tax shall still be handled in accordance with Article 3. (Article 5) Those who have civil wasteland with owners that has not been cultivated shall, after presenting red deeds and old receipts for verification, be investigated by the Finance Bureau and issued a permit for reclamation. The permit shall state that the land must be cultivated and the land grade must be increased within three years. If the land is not cultivated within three years, it shall be confiscated by the government and sold at auction. (Article 6) Those who have civil wasteland without owners that has not been cultivated shall have the area surveyed by the Finance Bureau, and a map shall be drawn and posted. The deadline for bidding shall be set. Each mu shall pay four yuan, and a permit for reclamation shall be issued.

<p>A Series of Robberies Occurs in Xinqiao District: At about 12:00 PM on the 26th, a group of twenty to thirty bandits armed with guns suddenly broke into the home of Pan Yintang, located about two li east of Xinqiao Chedun Town. Fortunately, Pan Yintang was dressed plainly and did not attract the attention of the bandits, so he sneaked out through a small door. As a result, about four hundred yuan was robbed. At the same time, the home of Shi Zitang, not far away, was also robbed. The owner was threatened with a burning candle on his face to reveal the location of the hidden silver. The reported losses were very heavy.</p>
<p>Record of the Trial of Bandit Pig Zhuo Amei: The bandit Pig Zhuo Amei repeatedly gathered crowds to rob in Songjiang and Jinshan, and his crimes were heinous.

This morning, the County Court requested the Suijing District Headquarters to transfer him to the court for interrogation, considering that Pig Zhuo Amei had committed numerous crimes and needed to be investigated. Chief Prosecutor Zhu ascended the court and questioned Pig Zhuo Amei, who was wearing a camel-colored robe made of tribute cloth. He looked calm and unperturbed. He directly admitted that all the cases were committed by his subordinates, and that he was actually deceived by the reorganization faction last year. Now he is aware of his mistakes, but it is too late. He requested that the court carry out his execution as soon as possible. When asked about the whereabouts of his accomplices, he lowered his head and did not answer. After the interrogation, he was returned to the headquarters for detention.</p>

The County Government learned of this and dispatched Investigator Chen, along with a coroner, to the village to inspect the scene on the following morning.

<p>Tragic News of a Wife Whose Husband Trampled Her to Death: Huang Rongchu, a villager from Chentang Town, District 5 (Tianshang City), No. 34, was 23 years old. He worked as a laborer at the Zhenfeng Silk Factory outside the East Gate. He married Qin Xian, the daughter of Shen Jinshou from a nearby area, through a matchmaker two years ago. After the marriage, the couple lived in relative harmony. Recently, Rongchu suddenly became involved with a certain female worker, which Qin Xian discovered, leading to frequent conflicts. On the 25th, Rongchu and his wife went to the countryside together. However, Qin Xian, the next day, boarded a boat to the city with her mother, Shen Yao. Rongchu, who was in the mulberry field, saw his wife leaving and immediately went to stop her, resulting in an argument. In a moment of rage, Rongchu aimed a iron rake at the back of Qin Xian's head and trampled her down twice. Her brains splattered, and she died instantly. After Shen Aying, the deceased's elder brother, heard the news, he immediately took the murderer, Huang Rongchu, to the Yeqiao Public Security 13th Branch and escorted him to the General Bureau. Yesterday, Director Xu transferred him to the County Court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Two Robbery Cases in a Row: On the night before last, the home of Lu Yunruo, a resident of Luzhuang Bridge, District 13 (Xin'an Township), was suddenly invaded by more than 20 robbers. Each held flashlights, handguns, wooden sticks, iron rulers, and other fierce weapons. First, one robber used a bamboo pole to climb over the wall and enter the courtyard. Then, he opened the front door, and the remaining robbers rushed in. The robbers then ransacked the house, overturning boxes and cabinets, for about two hours before leaving with their loot, shouting and yelling. Upon inspection afterward, it was found that over 400 yuan in silver currency and clothes, jewelry, and other items had been robbed, totaling a loss of over 1,000 yuan. Also, a boat suddenly arrived inside the harbor near Hongshengli, District 10 (Nanyan City). There were six robbers on the boat, all with painted faces and holding weapons. They swarmed ashore and went to the tomb of Qian Qingfen of Qifang Bridge, which was guarded by the tomb keeper Zhu Ajiu. They opened the back door and robbed the place, stealing clothes, silver currency, etc., with a loss of about 60-70 yuan.</p>
<p>Two Major Fires in One Day: The Zhongwai Pharmacy outside the North Gate of this county, at the entrance of Xiaosifang Alley, was established with funds raised by Hu Shutang from Zhenjiang. The business was quite prosperous. Recently, the pharmacy also began selling foreign goods and all kinds of cosmetics. They rented a house (three one-story rooms) belonging to Zhao Youcheng in the alley to use as a storage warehouse. They assigned Shao Ruifang, his maternal uncle, to live there and be responsible for guarding it. However, Shao, who was over 50 years old, was not very agile. On the morning of yesterday, around 11 a.m., Ruifang entered the room from outside. Because there were no electric lights installed, the room was very dark. He took a match and lit a candle. After using it, he carelessly threw the remaining matchstick into a straw basket containing glass lamp covers, causing a fire. Immediately, flames shot out and burst through the roof. The fire brigades from various sections arrived and tried their best to extinguish the fire, but only after two rooms and goods were burned. The total loss was estimated at around 5,000 yuan. The houses of the neighbors on both sides were also damaged considerably. The neighbors are now planning to demand compensation for their losses from Hu Shutang, the owner of the pharmacy. Also, there were forty-eight thatched sheds on the east side of the Diaobridge outside the West Gate. Yesterday, around 9 p.m., a fire suddenly broke out in Zhang Laolao's thatched shed. Immediately, fierce flames soared into the sky, making it impossible to approach. The fire brigades from various sections were alerted and arrived to put out the fire, but the fire was so intense that it was difficult to extinguish for a while. By around 10 p.m., the fire was finally extinguished. All forty-eight thatched sheds were reduced to ashes. Over two hundred men and women from Jiangbei, who were living there, suffered.</p>

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Villagers Obstruct Chengwu Steamship: There are two Xinhua steamships running daily between Jiangyin and Changzhou. The other day, when the ship reached the Ma Jia Village of Zhanggong Bridge, it was obstructed by hundreds of villagers who threw bricks and stones. Passengers were also injured and the ship could not move. Yesterday (the 25th), Zhu Pengxian, the manager of the ship, sent staff member Wang Taoqian to the location to negotiate with Jiang Hong and others, but without result. Starting today (the 26th), the Chengwu route has been temporarily suspended. A telegram was sent to the Xinhua Bureau in Changzhou to send a ship to Shiyan, and then the Xinheng ship will take over to temporarily maintain transportation. It is said that the obstruction is related to the issue of competing routes with Qiazhen Company's Beifeng steamship.</p>
<p>Record of the Interrogation of Wu Jingxian Regarding His Kidnapping: Wu Jingxian, the former administrative committee member of Danan Township, was kidnapped in Liyang the year before. The county arrested a suspect related to the case, Zhang Suobao. Wu was summoned to Liyang twice for questioning, but it was unsuccessful. Recently, Magistrate Zhu inquired and ordered Wu to be questioned nearby and then send the written record to Liyang. Yesterday, Wu came to the case and stated that on December 13th of last year, after the rental tax affairs ended, he hired the boat of tenant Zhang Suobao to return to Cheng. Beforehand, fearing bandits, he kept it secret and set the departure for the 14th. However, on that day, the boat was not seen. Someone came to knock on the door of his room. Zhang went to open the door, and five bandits came and kidnapped him. After the danger was over, Zhang acted as if nothing had happened, and there was substantial suspicion of involvement. After the interrogation, he was ordered to return home.</p>
<p>Three-Year-Old Bandit Corpse Looks as if Still Alive: In the spring of the eighteenth year, Zhang Pinquan, the former head of the Public Security Bureau, led a team to suppress a riot of bandits in Houcheng, killing many.

Their faces looked as if they were still alive and had not decayed. For days, many people went to watch, all calling it strange.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Province Business Tax Planned to Be Contracted to Chambers of Commerce: The Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations and Implementation Rules were previously passed by the Provincial Government in the 367th meeting and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for record. Later, the chambers of commerce of various counties in Jiangsu Province, because the provincial regulations violated the ministerial outline, once gathered in Zhenjiang to discuss and elect representatives to go to the province to petition for correction. Now it is known that the provincial regulations have been revised by the Ministry of Finance and are waiting to be submitted to the Executive Yuan and then to the Central Political Council and the Legislative Yuan for approval. However, because Jiangsu Province's finances have been drastically shortened since the self-determination of the Lijin tax, it is urgent to make up for it, so the revised regulations and implementation rules have been re-submitted to the Provincial Government for implementation. Now the Jiangsu Provincial Government is actively preparing for the collection of business tax. However, because the matter is a new initiative, and the collection is more complicated than other donations and taxes, it is still mainly to imitate the contracting system of Zhejiang Province, with the chambers of commerce in each county separately contracting. It is heard that the chambers of commerce in each county are quite likely to accept the contracting system. However, because there is no word of contracting in the regulations, it is planned to ask the Department of Finance to first draft the contracting regulations before further consultation.</p>
<p>Counties Rush to Collect National Assembly Election Ballots: The Jiangsu Provincial Office for the Election of National Assembly Representatives has reviewed the election registers submitted by various counties and compiled them into a general register, which was distributed to various counties yesterday.

<p>Opium Offender Escapes by Feigning Illness: Qian A'gen, a resident of Xintai, was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for opium offenses at the Pinghu Prison and has already served three months. However, Qian's conduct was improper before he was arrested, so he was accused of being a bandit. Qian heard of this rumor and feared being severely punished, so he falsely claimed to be ill and asked the guard to take him to the hospital for treatment. The guard, Xia, believed it to be true and reported to the warden. Xia took Qian to the Deji Hospital in Tangjiahang for treatment. On the way, the offender took the opportunity to escape. Xia chased after him without success and reported the case. After being questioned by the trial officer Song, the warden was asked to guarantee that the offender would be found and returned to custody as soon as possible, otherwise he would be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for custody and request instructions from the province for further investigation.</p>

Later, the Dingjiaqiao Security Corps discovered that the kidnapped victim was being taken by the bandits towards Changxing. They immediately sent platoon leader Zhou to lead more than ten members of the corps to chase after them. After walking for about ten miles, they were indeed caught up. The members of the corps immediately opened fire, and the bandits returned fire and resisted arrest. The two sides fought for more than ten minutes. Unable to withstand the bandits' strength, they abandoned the kidnapped victim and fled to the southwest. The corps members immediately took the kidnapped victim back to the corps headquarters and notified the family to claim him.</p>
<p>Bandits Shoot the Victim, One Dead, Two Wounded: Zhao A'san, a farmer from Niwandou in Guoxibay outside the South Gate of this city, was a small well-to-do family and had long been coveted by bandits.

The bandits heard this and immediately shot Zhao A'san several times with their guns. Zhao died on the spot. A'san's sister-in-law, Lu, and his niece-in-law, Li, were both shot and wounded by the bandits. Lu's grandson, Jifu, eleven years old, was kidnapped by the bandits and released halfway.

<h3>Zhejiang University's Education Staff Appeals Again for Funding</h3>
<p>The funding for National Zhejiang University was previously allocated by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance from the collection of national taxes. Since January of this year, the Department of Finance has stopped allocating funds because it no longer collects national taxes. The school authorities have repeatedly telegraphed the Department of Finance and the Department of Education to request a solution. Although the Department of Finance has telegraphed the Department of Finance to allocate funds from the business tax, the Department of Finance believes that the business tax is a local tax and cannot afford the school's funding even after it is levied. Therefore, it has been shelved again. It is heard that all the teaching and administrative staff of the school have been working hard to maintain it for three months. If the funding is still not available, the school will be in a desperate situation. Yesterday, they specifically telegraphed Chairman Chiang to request a swift solution. The telegram said: "Nanjing, Chairman Chiang, we hope you will understand. The funding for Zhejiang University is now allocated by the Ministry of Finance to the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance from the Zhejiang Province's business tax, but the Zhejiang Department of Finance refuses to allocate funds on the grounds that the tax is a local tax and there is no surplus capacity to bear it. Zhejiang University has had no funding since January of this year and has been on the verge of collapse for three months. The school's operations are almost suspended and the livelihoods of our colleagues are difficult to maintain. We are telegraphing again to Your Excellency, urging you to order the Ministry of Finance to quickly determine a solution and implement it immediately, and to immediately release the funding for January and February to alleviate the emergency. Otherwise, we will have no choice but to resign collectively to avoid delays." All the teaching and administrative staff of National Zhejiang University, Li Ximou, Tan Xihong, Zhang Shaozhong, Chen Bojun, Zheng Zonghai, Qian Baozhong, Shen Naizheng, Yang Cililian, Pan Silin, Fan Yunzi, Li Shouheng, Zhang Zuyin, Cao Fengshan, Wu Fuchu, Chen Daxie, Zhao Zengjue, Yu Kuang, Xu Xuan, Sun Xin, Wu Gengmin, Zhu Wufei, Liang Xi, Sun Congzhou, Yu Ziyi, Tang Zimei, and others respectfully appeal.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Education Circles Petition Again in Beijing</h3>
<p>The salt surtax, which was designated as the Jiangxi Education Fund, was taken over by the central government this year. The Ministry of Finance, according to the decision of the State Council, still used this fund for Jiangxi's education expenses and ordered the Xiantan Tariff Transportation Bureau to directly deliver it to the Education Department for safekeeping from March onwards. Recently, there has been talk of handing over the above-mentioned surtax to the Shen Finance Department for allocation. People in the Jiangxi education community believe that the arrears of education funds in the past are more than six months, amounting to millions, and if the education fund is misappropriated again in the future, the future is truly worrying. Therefore, they unanimously advocated requesting the Ministry of Finance to maintain the original order, ordering the Xiantan Tariff Transportation Bureau to directly pay the full amount as before to avoid the suspension of education. Chen Yingchun and Zhu Yuanqing were specially appointed as representatives to join the head of the Education Department, Xia Cheng, for the second time to petition in Beijing. It was recently heard that the representatives had arrived in Beijing on the 24th and were negotiating with all parties. It is heard that the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance have agreed to accept the representatives' request, ordering the Xiantan Tariff Transportation Bureau to act accordingly.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Two Cultural Institutions in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Qingdao University</p>
<p>Qingdao Observatory</p>
<p>Qingdao has worked hard to build since its recovery. The road administration was well-established during the German administration era, and it has been maintained with great effort recently, without any reduction in quality. Due to the strict security on both land and water routes, the city's public safety is ensured, so residents can live in peace and new buildings are added every year. Recently, I visited two cultural institutions and recorded their general situation as follows.</p>
<p>Qingdao University: Founded in the 19th year of the Republic of China, President Yang Zhensheng merged and expanded the original Shandong Provincial University and the private Qingdao University. It now has two departments of literature and science. The Department of Literature is divided into the Department of Chinese Philosophy, the Department of Foreign Philosophy, and the Department of Education. The Department of Science is divided into the Department of Mathematics, the Department of Physics, the Department of Chemistry, and the Department of Biology. There are a total of seven departments. It is also planned to establish a College of Agriculture in Jinan. The Qingdao campus uses the Bismac Barracks from the German administration era. The funding is 360,000 yuan allocated annually by the Shandong Provincial Government, 4,000 yuan allocated monthly by the railway, and 180,000 yuan allocated annually by the central government. Excluding the central government funds that have not yet been received, it can actually receive more than 400,000 yuan each year. However, there are only more than 100 students, and each student consumes more than 3,000 yuan per year. All are first-year students, including more than ten female students and nearly 30 professors.</p>
<p>Qingdao Observatory: This observatory was built by the Germans, taken over by the Japanese, and received by our country in the 13th year of the Republic of China. The observatory is located on the Shuidao Mountain, now called Guancha Mountain. It is divided into the Meteorology Department, the Pool Magnetics Department, the Seismology Department, the Astronomy Department, and the Oceanography Department. It has a dome equatorial instrument room, a library, and publishes the Guancha Monthly Report, the half-year Astronomy Report, the half-year Marine Publication, and the Shallow Explanation of Ocean Currents. It participates in the International Longitude Measurement Achievement Report. The contents include the Qingdao Climate Outline, the Research on Qingdao Temperature, the Shandong Peninsula Typhoon Record, Clouds and Weather, Shallow Explanation of Geomagnetism, Ocean and the Future of China, Oceanographic Research Institute, Qingdao Observatory and Municipal Administration, Overview of Qingdao Observatory's Seismographic Equipment, and the General Situation of Chinese Climate Repair in the Last Ten Years. The 5th Anniversary of the Qingdao Observatory and the Negotiation Process of the Qingdao Observatory's Japanese Personnel Pending Cases are compared with the new-made Social Science and the steps and purposes of the Japanese Social Science Research Oceanography. There are dozens of statistics such as the Qingdao Season Table of the 20th Year of the Republic of China, the Chinese Climate Map, the North Pacific Seawater Temperature Distribution Map, the North Pacific Air Pressure Distribution Map, and the East Asian Low-Pressure and Yangfeng Wind. Director Jiang Bingran has been in charge since the recovery and has worked very hard, but the monthly funding is only 3,000 yuan. This observatory still retains Japanese personnel, and negotiations have not been completed.</p>

<h3>&lt;Northern Ningbo Railway Coal Industry Association's Telegram to Shanghai Municipality P] Coal Industry Association:</h3>
<p>We have received your esteemed telegram. Although our railway and the Kaijie Mining Bureau have unresolved outstanding issues, coal transportation has not been halted. The person in charge of the mining's northern sales office recently made a statement to the Tianjin press, explaining that coal production has been minimized due to recent construction projects within the mine. The mining bureau has also sent a letter regarding the March coal order, stating that it will not be able to fully supply it. The advertisement in the Shanghai newspapers by the mine's sales office, claiming that coal transportation has been halted due to transportation difficulties, may have ulterior motives. This is a special reply for your reference.</p>
<p>Northern Ningbo Railway Bureau prepares for various groups to welcome the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Inspection Group.</p>
<p>Nanyang Batavia Overseas Chinese, recently realizing that buying domestic goods is opportune due to the favorable gold-to-silver ratio, have formed the Nanyang Dutch Overseas Chinese Business Inspection Group, which departed from Batavia on the 25th to return to China. Various local groups, such as the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, are preparing to receive them and send representatives to the port to welcome them.</p>
<p>Various industry trade associations revise the implementing regulations of the Trade Association Law.</p>
<p>Organizing a labor union should be limited to non-shop employees.</p>
<p>Trade association representatives, shop employees, and shop owners must be balanced.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a joint request from 32 trade associations, including the Chinese Medicine Industry, requesting the Central Government to amend the recently promulgated revised implementing regulations of the Trade Union Law.</p>
<p>The original text reads: "Based on the situation, the case was submitted on the 25th of this month by the Chinese Medicine Trade Association, Silk Fabric Trade Association, Local Goods Trade Association, Restaurant Trade Association, Bamboo Trade Association, Jiangjiu Wine Shop Trade Association, Face Powder Trade Association, Cosmetics Trade Association, New Medicine Trade Association, North-South Goods Exchange Trade Association, South Goods Trade Association, Cooked Food Trade Association, Flour Mill Trade Association, Tobacco and Vegetable Trade Association, Mercerized Cotton Weaving Trade Association, Department Store Trade Association, Knitting Trade Association, Western-style Woodworking Trade Association, Fresh Meat Trade Association, Rickshaw Trade Association, Book Trade Association, Mao Tea Trade Association, Rice Shop Trade Association, Construction Factory Trade Association, Paint Trade Association, Candle Trade Association, Shaoxing Wine Trade Association, Pig Trade Association, Dry Tobacco Trade Association, Ice Fresh Produce Trade Association, Paper Trade Association, Antique Books, Gold and Stone Jade Trade Association jointly stated in a letter that shop employees are the main assistants in commercial entities, and should join the trade association to collectively promote commercial development. Previously, Dai Chuanxian, a member of the 32nd Standing Committee of the Central Government, proposed key points regarding the principles of commercial organization and the methods for applying the new Chamber of Commerce Law, and the Training Department of the Central Executive Committee issued orders No. 12347, clarifying the relationship between trade associations and labor unions in detail. However, Article 10 of the recently revised Implementing Regulations of the Trade Association Law stipulates that 'Each company or firm may send one to two representatives from its members under Article 7 of this law, limited to managers or principals. If the average number of shop employees exceeds ten in the most recent year, one additional representative should be sent, mutually elected by the shop employees of each company or firm, but not exceeding three.' The potential consequences of this regulation will fundamentally shake the organization of trade associations. This is because the commercial sector in this city is thriving, and the number of employees often exceeds thirty or forty. If the new revised regulations are followed, the composition of trade associations will be in a ratio of three to two, eventually becoming a group controlled by employees, fundamentally eliminating the original intent of trade association organization. This is the first point. The National Industry and Commerce Conference has resolved to encourage the joint organization of industry and commerce. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce's administrative plan also urges the establishment of industry and commerce trade associations in various regions. If the new revised regulations are implemented, not only will those who have not yet organized be encouraged to organize, giving workers the opportunity to dominate, but also those who have already organized will be allowed to disintegrate. This is in stark contrast to the government's policy direction. This is the second point. The existing organization of various industry labor unions in this city should comply with laws and regulations and join trade associations. However, some, such as the South Goods Industry, Medicine Industry, and Pharmaceutical Industry, have no so-called technical workers but are still transforming to organize labor unions, which is in violation of laws and regulations. If they are allowed to exist, workers can join trade associations as representatives and use their labor union status as a tool for struggle, effectively holding both the employer and industrial/commercial status. The potential harms are even more unthinkable. This is the third point. Our associations feel deeply concerned and dare not remain silent. We should present the reasons and request your association to promptly forward them to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. All industry labor unions organized by employers should be immediately ordered to dissolve and be ordered to join trade associations to comply with laws and regulations. Article 10 of the Implementing Regulations of the Trade Association Law should be revised to state that shop employees should not exceed two to ensure fairness. We hope this will be considered and handled accordingly." After arriving at the meeting, it was found that Instruction No. 12437 of the Central Executive Committee interpreted the relationship between trade associations and shop employees, stating that trade associations are a national entity for coordinating employees and owners, aiming to enhance the common welfare of the industry rather than seeking individual benefits for any individual or group. Although the organization of employee labor unions also has a considerable history, it is almost purely a group of shop employees. This system is no longer applicable to the needs of the tutelage period. If it is still allowed to exist in the future, trade associations and labor unions will inevitably form opposing situations, each using their group as a tool for struggle, which clearly contradicts the essence of civil training during the tutelage period. Therefore, shop employees should not have any organization other than participating in trade associations.</p>
<p>The central government's instructions are profound and clear. Based on the reports from each association, such as the South Goods Industry, its workers previously had a Zhejiang-Ningbo Tea and Food Workers' Union. The members of the South Goods Labor Union organized this time are almost all shop employees, in other words, almost all former members of the Workers' Union. As for the Medicine Industry, it has always only had a Workers' Union and no Labor Union. The clerks and others providing labor services have also joined the Workers' Union. According to current laws and regulations, detailed analysis is required. Except for a small portion of clerks providing services who may be able to form a separate Labor Union, the remaining employees should not have any other organizations. However, the newly organized Medicine Labor Union this time is still transformed from the former Workers' Union, with shop employees still constituting the majority. This is a central entity for harmonizing shop employees and shop owners, allowing them to jointly organize and coordinate. In the end, the result is just a situation where the Workers' Union is changed to a Labor Union, and the struggle continues to intensify. This is truly failing to live up to the central government's great intentions. It is requested that the membership rosters of each newly formed Labor Union be collected and thoroughly reviewed. If there are indeed no shop employees, their organization should be allowed. If shop employees are mixed in, they should be asked to withdraw their names. If they are all shop employee organizations, each newly formed Labor Union cannot exist independently and should be ordered to disband immediately. Handling it in this way would be consistent with laws and regulations and the central government's instructions. Since trade associations are entities for coordinating employees and owners, there should not be an organization where the majority manipulates the minority, resulting in a tool solely for a small group to seek their own interests. The requests from each association to amend Article 10 of the Implementing Regulations of the Trade Association Law to state that shop employees should not exceed two at most are in accordance with Instruction No. 12437 of the Ministry of Training to prevent trade associations from being dominated and manipulated by a small group. Considering the circumstances, it is indeed necessary to report the situation and request approval for implementation for the convenience of the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<p>Hua Shang Yarn Factory requests another extension to transport and sell stored yarn and cloth.</p>
<p>Due to domestic demand not being met.</p>
<p>The local Hua Shang Yarn Factory Association previously requested an extension of the deadline for transporting yarn and cloth stored before February 1st, which had not been transported by the deadline, to continue paying taxes according to the old regulations, and was granted an extension until the end of March by the Tariff Department. Now, the association, considering the sluggish sales recently, fears that it will still be unable to complete the task on schedule, and has sent another letter to the Tariff Department of the Ministry of Finance requesting another extension to alleviate commercial difficulties. The original letter states: "Respectfully, we previously requested that the deadline for transporting yarn and cloth stored before February 1st before February 15th to continue paying taxes according to the old regulations be extended, as the deadline set by your department was very tight. We received a reply stating that it had been forwarded and approved to be extended to the end of March. However, yarn sales have been very sluggish in recent months, and the products of Chinese factories are particularly slow to sell. The reason is that domestic demand is not strong, and foreign firms are not buying much. Customs procedures and tax payment disputes also have a significant impact. Therefore, according to reports from various factories, less than one-tenth of the yarn and cloth manufactured before February 1st that has already been inspected by your department has been transported and sold to date.</p>
<p>Page 10</p>
<p>Secondly, based on the market situation, it is definitely impossible to transport and sell everything in a very short period of time. On the 13th of this month, a meeting of our association's factories resolved that we could only submit a request to your department, hoping for sympathy and report to the senior level, etc. This letter is respectfully submitted, hoping for approval and gratitude beyond measure."</p>

<p>Changjiang Steamer Annam Sailors Return to Haiphong.</p>

<p>Edward Sues the Public Concession Case, the Public Concession Manager.</p>
<p>Edward believed that the Public Concession Authority violated the initial verbal agreement made by the London agent of the Public Concession Authority, which stated that he could be employed for life unless there was negligence or incompetence. He sued the Consular Court, demanding the salary he deserved, travel expenses back to his country, and compensation for damages. The Consular Court ruled the other day that the Yangjingbang Regulations stipulate that the Public Concession Authority cannot enter into contracts with employees for more than three years unless specifically permitted by taxpayers. Therefore, even if there was such a verbal agreement, it cannot bind the Public Concession Authority. The Public Concession Authority naturally has the legal right to refuse to renew the contract without giving a reason, and the Consular Court has not seen any reason for damages in this case. The lawsuit should be dismissed, and the court fees should be borne by the plaintiff. However, this ruling does not prejudice the plaintiff's original relationship with the Public Concession Authority during the contract period, nor does it want the Public Concession Authority to change its original attitude towards the petitioner as a result of this ruling.</p>
<p>Fei Xindun Appointed as the General Manager of the Public Concession Authority.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that the Public Concession Authority recently resolved to appoint Fei Xindun as the General Manager of the Public Concession Authority, effective April 1st of this year. At the same time, there will be slight changes in the staff of the Police Department and the Fire Brigade.</p>
<p>The Commendable Spirit of the Engineer's Courageous Rescue.</p>
<p>British Consul-General Presents Bronze Medal and Citation.</p>
<p>The Zi Lin News reported that on September 5th of last year, the New Beijing steamboat, sailing to Ningbo, had two engineers, He Zeng, suddenly faint and fall into the water at the Songkou port. The third engineer, Shi Deladun, seeing this, disregarded the strong wind, rapid tide, and dark sky, and jumped from the 35-foot-high deck of the dining hall into the water to hold He Zeng. They were rescued by a sampan after ten minutes. The British Royal Charity Society, hearing of Shi's courageous spirit, presented him with a bronze medal and citation, which was personally awarded by the British Consul-General, Bai Linan, at the office yesterday to commend him.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Victims of the New Kang Disaster Return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Result.</p>
<p>The New Kang Steamer Disaster Relatives Association, due to the unresolved case, sent representatives Zhu Xiaoyun, Zhu Youcun, Chen Jicheng, etc., to Beijing three times to petition. It is now known that the representatives returned to Shanghai yesterday. The results of the petition were quite satisfactory. Chairman Jiang was very concerned about this case and instructed General He, the adjutant of the Military Affairs Office, to meet with the petitioning representatives on the morning of the 25th at 9:00 am. The representatives presented all requests, including the National Government's passive efforts to quickly resolve the case and the active removal of unequal treaties and the cancellation of consular jurisdiction, as well as the cancellation of foreign vessels navigating in China's territorial waters. General He accepted them one by one and promised to forward them to the Chairman for review and resolution. Hu Shize, the Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, met with the representatives and directly stated that there were no fewer than twenty or so cases of negotiations between China and Japan. In this case, he would resolutely follow the orders of the National Government and listen to the opinions of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the families of the victims to actively and seriously negotiate and strive for a satisfactory resolution. Regarding the litigation issue, because the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had not reported to the Ministry, the details of the process were unknown and would be instructed to report to the Bureau for review and handling. Cai Pei, the Director of the Shipping Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, also stated to the petitioning representatives that the Ministry would continue to actively pursue the previously determined negotiation policy for this case and strive for the cancellation of foreign vessels navigating in China's territorial waters and would consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to proceed. It is said that the association is scheduled to convene a general meeting in the coming days to report everything and discuss the negotiation process.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Inquires about the Types of New Weights and Measures Needed by Various Industries.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a circular to various trade associations yesterday to promote the new system of weights and measures, stating: "Respectfully, the implementation of the new system of weights and measures in this city is scheduled to begin on July 1st of this year. This association, in accordance with Instruction No. 8016 of the Bureau of Social Affairs, convened a meeting of representatives from various industries on the afternoon of the 25th of this month to discuss the promotion method. The results of the discussion on that day resulted in six resolutions: (1) It was decided that July 1st would be the date for the city to implement the new system, and one party would inform each industry to file with the inspection office in the same direction.

<p>National Medicine Industry Initiates National Organization.</p>
<p>Preparations are underway in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Representatives from the Chinese medicine industry trade associations in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, Wujin, and other places, including Zhang Meidi'an, Cheng Diao, Zhi, Fang Liu, Yuan, Bi Huai, Zhi, Cao Jian, Chu, etc., took the opportunity to attend the preparatory meeting of the Central Chinese Medicine Museum in Beijing and convened a discussion meeting with more than 40 representatives from industry groups in various provinces and cities. They had lengthy discussions on issues such as the development of the entire medicine industry. The result was a unanimous decision to unite the established medicine industry trade associations in various provinces, cities, and counties in accordance with the provisions of the Industry and Commerce Trade Association Law to jointly organize the National Medicine Industry Trade Association Federation, with the aim of concentrating the strong forces of pharmaceutical merchants across the country and uniting to promote the development and prosperity of the entire pharmaceutical industry. It was decided that the representatives attending the meeting would be the initiators to first establish a preparatory committee, electing Zhang Mei'an, Cheng Diao, Zhi, Fang Yi, Yuan, Bi Huai, Zhi, Cao Jian, Chu, Cen Zhiliang, Chen Chuxiang, etc., as seven preparatory committee members and designating Zhang Mei'an as the convener. A preparatory office was temporarily set up at 100 Beijing Road, 5th Floor, inside the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Industry Trade Association. The steps to be taken are as follows: (1) The preparatory committee will submit the name to the competent authority for filing. (2) The preparatory committee will urge the local pharmaceutical merchants in various provinces, cities, and counties to promptly organize trade associations in accordance with the law to prepare for basic organization.

<p>Hui-Ning Fellow Townsmen's Association Rescues the Unjust Case in Sanxi Town, Jingde.</p>
<p>The Hui-Ning Fellow Townsmen's Association in Shanghai has continuously received joint letters from the Jingde Huizhou Fellow Townsmen's Association, the Jing County Xin'an Fellow Townsmen's Association, and dozens of fellow townsmen in Shanghai, including Hu Xiangjun and Lu Muzhi, reporting that a major unjust case has recently occurred in Sanxi Town, Jingde, where more than ten honest silk merchants have been falsely accused and arrested, which can be described as an unprecedented injustice. The cause of this case lies in the fact that Cao Zhijun, a patrol officer from the Public Security Bureau of the town last year, was expelled and deported by the gentry and merchants for violating police regulations and harming local security. After being expelled, Cao acted unscrupulously and became a bandit. He has now been arrested by the 171st Brigade of Wuhu. Because of his hatred for the gentry and merchants of the town, the bandit falsely accused them in a poisonous scheme to wipe them out in one fell swoop. The silk merchants he accused, such as Wang Siwo, Hu Shaofu, Wang Bochao, Tang Qiu, Dinghe Store, Hong Qijiu, Hong Gongcheng, Dingxin Store, Cao Lijun, Cao Yiji, Cao Yilong, Jiang Zhaoliang, etc., and two patrol officers from the Public Security Bureau, a total of more than ten people, were either falsely accused of being the commander of the Communist Party, or the staff officer, or the proofreader, etc. According to the confession, the Wuhu Brigade telegraphed Chen County, Jingde, to lead a team to Sanxi to search house by house. Because there was no evidence, Wang Siwo, Hu Shaofu, Tang Qiu, Hong Rongzhang, and Cao Lijun were detained by the county government. These people are all honest gentry families, from clean families and descendants of scholars. Now they have all been falsely accused of being accomplices, which is truly outrageous. Moreover, Hong Gongcheng and Cao Yiji, who are the names of stores in the bandit's confession, were also accused of being Communist bandits, which is even more bizarre and absurd. Since this case occurred, all the formal gentry and merchants in Sanxi Town have been wiped out in one fell swoop. For a time, the entire county was in an uproar, and telegrams were sent to Beijing, Anhui, Shanghai, and Wuhu for help. The County Party Department and various public organizations jointly organized a post-accusation association for the gentry and merchants in Sanxi and elected representatives to petition the authorities in the province and Wuhu, hoping to overturn the verdict. The Huining Fellow Townsmen's Association in Shanghai is extremely indignant about this unjust case and has telegraphed the authorities in Anhui and Wuhu and Chen County, Jingde, to conduct careful investigation and research to clarify the truth and overturn the extraordinary injustice to avoid false accusations.</p>
<p>The Labor Dispute at Hua Shun Rubber Factory Resolved.</p>
<p>The Hua Shun Rubber Factory on Kang Nao Road announced a temporary shutdown for internal reorganization in February, and there has been no reopening date for a long time. The livelihoods of all male and female workers in the factory have been affected. They had no choice but to apply for assistance from the Bureau of Social Affairs. At 9:00 am yesterday, the Bureau convened both labor and management for mediation. Qiu Xijiu, the representative of the management, and He Xiaoqiu and Peng Jigen, the representatives of the labor, and Wang Bing, the chairman, signed a three-item agreement after a long discussion: (1) The factory will be allowed to reopen within ten days. (2) During the shutdown period, long-term workers will be paid their wages as usual, and pieceworkers will be subsidized for food expenses of three silver dollars per person per day from February 17th of this year. (3) The factory will never replace workers without reason or suspend work at will in the future.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Do Not Need to Organize a Labor Union.</p>
<p>The Civil Training Association will comply with the order.</p>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly reported that the authorities have not approved the request of rickshaw pullers in this city to organize a labor union. On the 16th of this month, the Executive Committee of this city received a letter from the Training Department of the Central Committee stating that the department had previously received a submission from the preparatory office of the Rickshaw Pullers' Labor Union in Shanghai requesting approval to establish the Rickshaw Pullers' Labor Union, etc. It was considered that although rickshaw pullers are manual laborers, they do not provide their labor based on an employment relationship. Rickshaw pullers rent vehicles, and their relationship with the owners of the vehicles is like that of landlords and tenants, not comparable to ordinary employers and employees. Moreover, rickshaw pullers' work is not fixed in terms of time and location. If they organize a labor union, it will be sufficient to influence their work. The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee was instructed to dissolve the preparatory office of the Rickshaw Pullers' Labor Union. Subsequently, letters were approved from the Qingdao Special Municipal Party Affairs Steering Committee and the Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Rectification Committee with the same reasons, and the department had separately reviewed and explained them. In addition to sending letters to the Party Departments of various provinces and special municipalities, this letter is sent to you for review and compliance. It is hereby stated that the central government has issued a public letter stating that the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Executive Committee has instructed the Shanghai Civil Training Association to expedite the issuance of permits to maintain labor transportation. However, the Rickshaw Pullers' Labor Union of Shanghai has not received approval to establish a labor union due to rickshaw pullers not being based on a landlord-tenant relationship. The preparatory office has been dissolved, and plans have been made to train rickshaw pullers. Therefore, it is hoped that you will check and handle it in accordance with the previous letter of this department (No. 12639). It is said that the Municipal Executive Committee has received the official documents regarding this case and has successively handed them over to the Civil Training Association for compliance.</p>
<p>Urgent Telegram from the Henan-Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association.</p>
<p>Contact Immigrants and Remit Funds Quickly.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Books and Donations Shaanxi Disaster Temporary Relief Association received a telegram from the Henan-Shaanxi Provincial Disaster Relief Association requesting contact with immigrants to handle the disaster and to quickly remit relief funds. The original telegram is recorded as follows: (1) We recently received a telegram from our representative, Li, and are pleased to learn that Henan Province is continuing to immigrate and has promised to consult with various charitable organizations in the north to assist in the resettlement north of Taiwan, in the same manner as last year. Ciyun is far-reaching and admirable. Now, Henan Province has decided to hold immigration activities. In addition to urgently requesting the Ministry of Railways to allocate vehicles and actively establishing reception centers, we hope that you will lend your support and invite the charitable organizations in the north to provide assistance as before. Send personnel to receive them at each station along the way, directly from Fengtai to Jilin-Heilongjiang, and instruct the Henan Provincial Disaster Relief Association, Zhang Fangyou. (2) According to a report from Shanyang County, Shanyang is located in remote mountains and has always been known for its hardship. At this time, natural disasters and man-made disasters are coming one after another. The rich have become poor, and the poor have no help. They have abandoned their homes and fled.

<p>Mrs. Zhou of the Zhou Family Starved to Death and Committed Suicide.</p>
<p>What is the feeling of a son?</p>
<p>Zhou Erpangzi, a Tongzhou native from 167 Wangjiazhai, Zhabei, and his elderly wife, Mrs. Zhou, who was already 52 years old, gave birth to a son named Zhou Miaoji, who was already thirty years old and married. The young couple lived separately in Yongfuli, living their own lives and not providing for their elderly parents, causing them to suffer from starvation. Mrs. Zhou deeply resented this situation and committed suicide by hanging herself the night before. Yesterday, the Second Section of the Fifth District learned of this and ordered the Jiyi Map to report to the local court for examination. The son still asked the court to waive the examination, but was ordered not to allow it. Inspectors and prosecutors were sent to the scene to clarify the situation and ordered to collect the body for burial after verification.</p>
<p>Changsha Steamer Detains Three Important Criminals.</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau suddenly received a telegram from the Fujian authorities stating that there were three important criminals traveling secretly from Fujian to Shanghai on the Japanese steamer Changsha. The steamer was scheduled to enter the port at 4:00 pm yesterday, and requested that personnel be dispatched quickly to intercept and arrest them. After receiving the telegram, Director Chen instructed a number of detectives to rush to Wusong to wait, and sent personnel to consult with the Japanese Consul-General to board the ship and search. It was not until 6:00 pm last night that the steamer entered the port. The detectives boarded the ship with the chauffeurs to inspect and arrested four people on the spot. They were immediately brought to the bureau. After preliminary interrogation by Director Chen, due to the seriousness of the case, in addition to immediately reporting to the mayor, he also telegraphed Beijing for instructions.</p>
<p>Sand Boat Owner Sues for Injustice.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhaoxiang is Accused of Receiving a Summons.</p>
<p>Guo Jixing, a sand boat from the Haizhou gang, shipped more than a thousand heads of yellow sprouts (seaweed) from Qingdao last month to Shanghai for sale. Guo Shixin, the owner of the boat, held a letter of credit from a Qingdao merchant, Zhi Shenghao, as proof. After entering the port, he duly reported to the customs, inspected the cabin, paid taxes, and sold the goods. On February 22, he set sail to return to Haizhou to catch the yellow croaker fishing season. Unexpectedly, before the boat had left Wusong, it was discovered by Zhang Zhaoxiang, the captain of the detective team of the Fourth District of the Wusong Jiangsu Water Police Provincial Public Security Team, that the son of the boat owner, Guo Shixin, was suspected of being a pirate, and that the goods loaded on the boat were stolen goods. The Fourth District Detective Team immediately detained the boat and escorted the boat owner, Guo Shixin, to the Fourth District Water Police Department for handling. This case has been pending for more than a month. It was not until the other day that the Fourth District Department ordered the boat owner, Guo Shixin, to be released on bail and ordered Guo to find his son and send him to the Department for investigation and handling. However, after Guo was released on bail from the Fourth District Department, he suddenly filed a criminal complaint with the local court against Zhang Zhaoxiang, the captain of the Fourth District Detective Team. It is reported that the court has accepted the complaint and scheduled a hearing.</p>
<p>Girl Killed in a Fire on Taoming Road.</p>
<p>The family of Ye Pengshi, a resident of 863 Hefeng Lane, Taoming Road, Yangshupu, had her son, Erbao, and a five-year-old girl named Wumei light an oil lamp at 4:35 pm the other day. They accidentally overturned it on the bed curtains, and it suddenly turned into a fire, piercing the roof. The girl was unable to escape and died in the fire. The Huishan patrol station in charge of the area reported the incident and sent detectives to investigate the cause of the disaster. It was caused by Ye Erbao playing with the oil lamp and overturning it. The corpse was carried to the Feilun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the Special District Court, came to the morgue to determine that the cause of death was burns before death, and the corpse was handed over to its mother, Ye Pengshi, for burial.</p>
<p>Dispute Over Houses in Sanli, Tongren Fuyuan Hall Resolved.</p>
<p>The houses in Dexing, Zhizhong, and Lixian, Sanli, on the east and west sides of Xixin Bridge Street, French Concession, are the property of the Shanghai Charity Organization Tongren Fuyuan Hall. After their completion last winter, all tenants organized a joint association because the tips and rents were too high and elected representatives to seek reductions. After repeated negotiations, Wang Yiting and Du Yuesheng came forward on the 12th of this month to mediate and adopted a compromise method, uniformly collecting and paying at 75% of the fixed amount. The tenants expressed their compliance. However, they must request the return of the tips. Until yesterday afternoon, Wang Yiting and Du Yuesheng came forward to mediate again. The tenants' representative, Jin Yu, accompanied by Zhou Yingshi, a standing committee member, went to Du's residence to meet with Wang and Du. After repeated consultations, because the tips collected by the hall had been reported to the municipal government for charitable purposes, it was impossible to change them. Now, the rent is uniformly reduced by half a month, that is, the rent is delayed by half a month. The lawyer and Zhou expressed their satisfaction and left. When all the tenants heard about it, they all felt grateful for the enthusiasm and consideration of Wang and Du. A rent dispute was completely resolved from then on.</p>

<p>Thief Implicates Security Team Members.</p>
<p>Cao Jinquan Questioned and Released After Being Falsely Accused.</p>
<p>The fifth team of the Security Team of the South Shanghai District has the most remote defense area on Longhua Road. Thieves come and go frequently, and the team's defense is very strict, and patrols are thorough, which is deeply hated by the thieves. On the evening of the 23rd of this month, someone was passing by Kangqu Bridge when they were robbed of ten silver dollars by thieves Jin Longsheng and Xu Axin. A police patrol happened to pass by and arrested the thieves on the spot. The thieves falsely claimed that Cao Jinquan, a member of the fifth team of the Security Team, was an accomplice. The team member was also arrested by the police and escorted to the local court. After questioning, it was learned that the team member was falsely accused by the thieves and was immediately released.</p>
<p>Police Station Recruits Owners to Claim Stolen Goods.</p>
<p>The Tissot Road Police Station arrested a thief on March 18 and seized 99 pawn tickets in his home. The thief confessed that he had been stealing goods in various parts of Shanghai and pawning them in the past six months. He confessed that he had been looking for residents with rental signs and entering to ask about renting a house, taking the opportunity to steal, or finding a way to remove the door locks or bolts first, and then waiting for an opportunity to climb through windows or cover the doors and enter to use his thieving skills. If there are any owners who have been stolen from in this way, they can go to the Tissot Road</p>

<p>The Return of a Poet in the Art World, Huang Zhenxia's New Work: On the Longhai Line by Xiao Jun. To be Published in the Fifth Issue of Vanguard Monthly.  Everyone surely hasn't forgotten that in the "Art World" section of the Shen Bao on August 24th of last year, an article by Mr. Ye Qiuyuan entitled "In Memory of Poet Huang Zhenxia" was published. At that time, everyone, whether acquainted with him or not, was shocked and grieved at the heroic death of our poet on the battlefield, and wept with emotion. In the inspirational poems of the ancient Chinese poet Li Taibai, there was the magnificent line "Draw your sword and chop the ground, do not sing mournful songs!" However, it was only a momentary outburst of emotion. Where could one find a poet drafting documents while sharpening his shield on the battlefield? Where could one find someone with such great enthusiasm for the nation, rushing to the front lines where bugles sounded and swords clashed? Even in the West, one could only find Lord Byron, who fought for the freedom of Greece, a figure who had never been preceded. Therefore, when news of the Battle of Guide came from afar, we assumed that Mr. Huang Zhenxia had died in battle. Moreover, his usual concern for the decline of our nation and the troubles of the Central Plains could be seen in all of his works, where his fiery enthusiasm and personality were fully displayed. Therefore, we firmly believed that he would not survive the brutal hand-to-hand combat. At that time, we could only face the distant wilderness and call for the soul of our poet, while also feeling that his loyalty and bravery in dying for the nation were admirable. Who knew that as the spring breeze stirred and ten thousand greens sprouted, the poet, who had disappeared without a trace, would return safely? This was a joy beyond our expectations. His friends, such as Mr. Zhu Yingpeng and others, felt especially boundless joy. He not only stood firm on the front lines, accomplishing the feat of pacifying the rebellion and relieving the suffering of the people in the north, but also brought back many soul-stirring works. A young soldier leading his troops, even amidst the continuous gunfire and smoke on the battlefield, maintained a composed and unhurried demeanor, able to pick up his pen and compose, delicately describing the scenes of battle at the time. The physical strength of our poet cannot but be admired. Among them, one piece, "On the Longhai Line," vividly depicts their journey from joining the army to their experiences on the front lines, capturing the tireless life on the battlefield day and night, and attempting to surpass Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front." Moreover, war novels often easily overlook the national consciousness and local color, but Mr. Huang Zhenxia does the opposite, using delicate brushstrokes to depict them everywhere, which is especially rare and valuable. Let us describe here the duties he assumed during the battle. He was not like the political workers who accompanied the army during the Sixteen Years, who only knew how to speak nice words like selling ointment and slept comfortably far from the front lines. Instead, he served as a common soldier among tens of thousands of Central Army soldiers, with countless brothers dying and wounded around him. Amidst the terrifying atmosphere of exploding shells shaking the earth, Mr. Huang was able to escape death. Fortunately, he participated in actual combat on the battlefield, allowing the flames of war to cleanse the sentimentality from his heart and fill it with a great national fervor. I believe that it is worthy of being called outstanding among many war novels. It is said that it will be published in the fifth issue of the nationalist publication "Vanguard Monthly." Everyone, whether they have experienced the iron face of the god of war or not, can use it as a mirror. This cannot but be said to be one of Mr. Huang Zhenxia's greatest gains, and it can also shock the Chinese literary world. As for his poetry, it has especially progressed in a frightening way. "Qin and Jian" (Lute and Sword) is a representative work, filled with powerful tones, and the rhetoric is becoming more and more perfect. It is said that it will also be published in "Vanguard Monthly." We feel twelve points of shame for Mr. Huang Zhenxia's perseverance and courage. One must know that a writer with talent and artistic cultivation should have more contact with real life. If one lingers in an ivory tower, only shouting violently in words, it will be of no help. In this time of internal and external aggression, we should shed this burning blood on the battle lines for the nation. This is the true color of our nation. If you don't believe it, try listening to the powerful songs of our poet, and you will immediately be inspired. In the future, our poet's achievements will be limitless, which we are extremely confident in. We sincerely offer our blessings here for his even greater future.</p>
<p>A Letter to the Editor of the Shen Bao Art World by Huang Zhenxia:</p>
<p>Since deciding to join the army in May of the nineteenth year, I hurriedly joined the ranks of the Central Military Academy Training Regiment. I successively experienced the life of a soldier and war in Nanjing, Xuzhou, Liuhe, Lanfeng, Kaifeng, and other places. During that time, the tense and frightening experience of traveling under the moon and stars has now been hastily written into more than 30,000 words in Hangzhou, "On the Longhai Line," which will be published in Vanguard Monthly. Life is originally full of the flavors of sourness, sweetness, bitterness, and spiciness, but some people are slower to adapt to various lives, while others are faster. Urban life is also a kind of tension and enthusiasm, but compared to the kind of spirit of sweat and blood in the army, the frantic emotions when life and death are imminent are more sluggish and stagnant. Moreover, coupled with the sincere friendship in the trenches and the spirit of self-sacrifice for others, it can simply be called the highest, most lamentable, and most commendable page in group life. However, everything is like fleeting clouds. Looking back today, I only find it laughable. In short, my joining the army was just a particularly humorous and interesting interlude in the tragedy of life. After the battle, I returned and remained the same. On the first day of January in the twentieth year, amidst heavy snowfall, I also took five days of leave to return to Shanghai to find my sister. Therefore, amidst the air of shouting to abolish the old calendar in the crowded train, I returned to the platform of the North Station. Counting from when I joined the army, it was only eight short months. However, looking in the mirror, I couldn't help but sigh at the rapid changes in life. Could this officer in military uniform and boots in the mirror really be Huang Zhenxia, who once drifted at sea? The cars and horses coming and going on the road were still as crowded as ever, and the dance halls were still playing light music as usual. The lives of my friends had not changed in the slightest, but my heart was much more lonely and mature, and I almost felt a sense of alienation. Among the friends I "reunited after a long separation," their reactions to my unexpected New Year's visit naturally revealed different emotions according to their personalities and experiences. Some were enthusiastic and almost shed tears, some only smiled slightly, and some even thought I had died and been resurrected. Among the various news that I was "dead," I also learned that since I joined the army, friends had mistakenly reported that I had died in battle, and even said that I died in the Battle of Guide. After receiving this news, I rushed to the Shen Bao office to find you, because you have been a friend of mine for six or seven years, and you would definitely understand this matter. However, unexpectedly, I was disappointed to find that you had gone to Hangzhou. After being disappointed, I rushed to Mr. Zhou Darong's house, and finally, in the new nest on the third floor of the Zhou residence, Zhou's wife personally handed me an old newspaper with Mr. Ye Qiuyuan's "Memorial Article" and a poem by a certain gentleman. Naturally, there is no need to say how I felt when I read it at the time. The question of life and death is originally a trivial and commonplace matter. However, for someone like me, a living person, to be able to read other people's elegies for myself in front of a lively crowd, isn't that too ridiculous? However, even though the facts are like this, how can I not express my deep gratitude to the passionate Mr. Ye and to you? All my friends, although I have been messing around on the Longhai Railway two thousand miles away for a few months, the result is not only that I did not die, but I have become much stronger and can even run continuously for an hour. Secondly, there is the matter of Byron. In fact, friends have openly called me a follower of Byron or even the "Eastern Byron." Although I don't have time to talk about this now, I might as well say a word or two about my general views. That is, I may have many similarities with this British poet's unrestrained and enthusiastic personality, and perhaps the various little things I have written have been influenced by him a little. However, you must remember that although Byron's temperament is unrestrained and enthusiastic, and his style is strong and heroic, what about his country? Is England his country? Although I dare not say that I am a pure nationalist, isn't China, which is about to produce Chinese nationalism, my beloved country? Although I am still serving the country now, my spirit is still always and forever united with you and many other respected friends. You must know that the hope for the future of the Republic of China must rely on our guns and your pens to work separately to achieve a thorough and satisfactory result. Finally, I want to reiterate one sentence: Dear friends, I not only did not die, but I have become much stronger and can even run continuously for an hour.</p>
<p>Preface to "Night in the French Park" by Zhang Ruogu Published by Malaya Bookstore. In the recent Chinese literary world, so-called "cheap" things are popular. Some chatter about sexual desire, some complain about poverty, some lament their life experiences, and some vent their grievances. In general, passive and decadent works are filling the display windows of bookstores. These crudely made things are emerging endlessly in the publishing world, but pure and excellent literary works are discarded in the wastepaper basket. I do not know how many truly talented young writers are buried, which is a sad and unfortunate phenomenon. Now I feel fortunate to be able to read Mr. Zeng Jinke's original manuscript of "Night in the French Park." I dare to admit that this is a collection of short stories that fully expresses the author's personality. This is an excellent early work. She not only gets rid of the habits of those impromptu works popular in the market, she really has her own special and unique style, and each piece is full of a kind of light flavor and happy mood. I was really happy after reading it. When I finished reading "Night in the French Park," I couldn't help but think of a few scattered impressions of the French Park in my old work "New Capital Pilgrimage." In the summer of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, one day after I visited Nanjing Xiushan Park, I wrote an article recalling the French Park. I remember there were these few sentences inside: "After arriving in the new capital, I often heard friends praising Xiushan Park, saying that it was the only place in Nanjing to enjoy the cool and rest. The scenery of the park is arranged very beautifully and neatly, as if it were the French Park in Shanghai... I heard that it is also a popular place for lovers. Many aggrieved women and infatuated men often use it as a place for secret meetings... People say it is like the French Park in Shanghai, probably because of this point... Walking on the rustling stone road in the park, looking around, I feel that this is the most interesting place in the whole city. The sunlight is warm, the vegetation is flourishing, and the air is full of romantic colors. The faces of the tourists all show traces of laughter and happiness. It really feels like I have arrived at the French Park in Shanghai." The French Park is such an attractive place. In modern literary works centered on Shanghai life, we have already seen many novels or poems that use the French Park as a background or theme. Now, Mr. Zeng Jinke alone pays attention to the night scenery and expresses the old feelings in his memories, which can be regarded as a kind of innovation. I believe that all young men and women who have visited the French Park at night will definitely be aroused by many sweet memories of them or her when reading Mr. Zeng's work. For this reason, the "Night in the French Park" collection of novels will definitely be welcomed by young men and women after it is published. This is a predictable wish. March 12, 1931, Zhang Ruogu in Shanghai</p>

<p>Youth Garden, Ah, Wanderer, by Su Jun. Walking in the night with Hai on Avenue Joffre, from the street with the colorful and dazzling lights of the shops to a quieter section where the streetlights are very lonely and the shadows of the trees seem to be sleeping. The street is often like an empty corpse being dragged past. Only the sound of a violin occasionally escaping from the window of a tall building is added to the dream of the wanderer on the street. Ah, I and Hai talked about art and science, about the philosophy of life and society. But finally, we abandoned these big questions - these big questions that will never be explained by wanderers - and talked about our own dreams. Everything is "..." in the wanderers' conversation. Hai said without raising his voice, "Aren't you going to move?" "If I don't find a better house, I really don't want to move," I said. "Hai, I really can't find a better house." "What kind of house?" Hai asked. "What are your standards for your ideal house?" "This is a dream I often have! A romantic dream," I said, and smiled. "Hai, maybe you have this dream like me." "Indeed," Hai said excitedly. He looked at me with dreamy eyes. "I have an ideal for housing, maybe the same as you, a romantic ideal. But it always becomes a wanderer's dream." "A wanderer's dream," I grabbed Hai's shoulder. "Tell me, tell me your romantic ideal." "This..." Hai said, shortening his steps and making them lighter, in order to make what he was about to say as beautiful as a novel that could be used to shoot a movie. "I often fantasize about getting a satisfactory landlord or subtenant..." Hai dreamed such a dream: The old landlady has a beautiful eighteen-year-old daughter! Not necessarily too urbanized, because a country girl also has her pure cuteness! And it would be good to have a six- or seven-year-old younger brother... But I dare not have Hai's hope. "As for me," I said, crying, because I thought what I was going to say was a strange idea. "Hai, I dare not look for a landlord who has a beautiful eighteen-year-old girl. I dream of a young landlady who is willing to use a good heart full of youthful colors to sympathize with a lonely wanderer, and it would be good if she loves her husband very much." "Ah," Hai exclaimed, "why are you chasing after a kind of tragedy?" "No," I argued, "I have no intention of occupying her. I said that she should love her husband very much and not let her good husband become suspicious." ...We turned around and walked back, and heard the long sound of the violin again. You dream of red. On this long road, ah, wanderer... Hai sang softly.</p>

<p>Youth Garden, Jiaotong University Female Students Riding Horses, by Nai Yi. Jiaotong University in western Shanghai is the only industrial school in our country. Its mission is to cultivate leading talents for the construction of a bright and splendid new China. Therefore, young women who aspire to build a new China and want to be useful talents should take studying at Jiaotong University as their only hope. Now I have learned that two female students in the third grade of the Railway Management College of the school, Qu Meixiang and Shao Zhuoran, believe that their studies are too busy, their mental work is too much, and their physical exercise is too little. At the same time, they also feel that life is too luxurious and comfortable, which will inevitably lead to the decline of their physical and mental qualities. The simplest remedy is to have outdoor exercises to strengthen the body. Therefore, the two ladies often use horseback riding as their indoor exercise. Every morning or dusk, the two ladies rush out of the school gate. The groom has already prepared the saddle, and after a few light and agile hours, they become heroines, galloping on Hongqiao Road like electric fans. Yesterday, Ms. Qu mentioned, "In the history of outdoor games in the women's world, horseback riding has never been recorded as being as popular as it has been among female students in American universities recently. Mt. Holyoke, Smills College, Cornell University, Christian College, and California are all leaders in American horseback riding groups. Now our school's Girls Classmates are gradually becoming fashionable, and this is indeed a very beneficial outdoor exercise. Our most recent plan is to take a long trip during the spring break, with the destination being along Yangshupu, through Jungong Road, and reaching the Wusong seaside," etc.</p>
<p>Back View by Yu. The training department of our school stipulates that students are only allowed to ask for leave to leave the school on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. On other days, they are not allowed to ask for leave without special reasons. We have also had several times when we wanted to go to the movies or buy things, etc. Without getting permission for the dates when we were allowed to leave the school, we falsely claimed an important matter to ask for the training department's permission. Today is Thursday. We had no classes after 3:00 PM and really wanted to buy something to eat. However, if we asked the maids to buy it, they would never be willing to buy it because the road was a bit far or they couldn't get much oil, and there was nothing good to eat nearby. If we asked for leave to leave the school, today is Thursday, so we definitely wouldn't get permission. If we were to make up another special reason, we were afraid that the training department would say, "Why do you always encounter these special or important things?" "Since they won't let us ask for leave, then we just won't ask for leave to leave the school," Li said angrily. "Good, I agree. They won't know so coincidentally," I and Zhu echoed. Looking at the training department, there was only one instructor sitting there reading a newspaper. She didn't pay attention to the outside, so the three of us walked past her and slipped out of the school gate. At Zhu's suggestion, we decided to go to the newly opened restaurant in Ximen to eat fried noodles. Walking out of Huangjia Que Road and onto Zhonghua Road, we gradually reached Ximen, and the banner of the newly opened restaurant had already entered our eyes. "Oh, the director of training is in front," Zhu, with sharp eyes, suddenly cried out in horror. Sure enough, in the shadowy crowd, a very familiar short and fat body wearing a blue cheongsam that we were used to seeing - who else could it be but the director of training? We looked at each other in horror and stopped. Fortunately, after a while, this short and fat back view did not look back and disappeared among the many people. Even if the taste of this fried noodles is so good, but this short and fat back view and blue cheongsam always swayed in our minds until we finished the noodles and returned to the school, even now every time we pass by Ximen.</p>

<h3>Eurasia Aviation Test Flight to Beiping Personnel Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

<p>All Aircraft Equipped with Radio Telegraphs</p>
<p>Li Jingcong, Director of Operations, and Shi Mide, Director of Air Navigation, of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, returned to Shanghai from Ping yesterday morning at 7:00 AM after flying to Beiping on the first and second Eurasia aircrafts on the 15th of this month. They reported the progress of the trip to President Shuang Qing of the company. They said that a suitable address had been found for the Doron Airport, but it would need to be slightly repaired before it could be used. The Beiping Nanyuan Airport has also been arranged. The two aircraft flying to Beiping are currently stationed there for official test flights. The airports in Jinan and Nanjing south of Beiping are borrowed from the original airfields of the Ministry of Military Affairs and are in good condition without the need for additional repairs. However, in order to prevent danger and protect the safety of passengers, the company will install radio telegraphs at all stations along the route and in each aircraft to report the situation in the air while each aircraft is flying or to report the station situation by airport personnel. In addition, each station will set up a climate measurement chart to test the climate in the air at all times. In the event of sudden changes in the climate, the aircraft will be notified by radio to fly carefully or land in advance. At this time, the radio telegraphs and climate measurement charts in each aircraft and station are being installed. According to Shuang Qing, the official flight will likely be delayed from April 1st due to the unfinished radio installation project, but it should be realized in early April. As for the Russian section of the Eurasia route, before the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, our country will never negotiate with the Soviet Union on navigation matters. As a result of negotiations between the German Hansa Company and Russia, the Soviet Union is responsible for handling the transportation of mail and passengers within the Russian border, and the aircraft of China and Germany will connect at both ends. The planned voyage from Shanghai, China to Berlin, Germany is eight days. According to the current situation, it may take five to six days to reach the destination. Great consideration is given to the issue of flight safety. Approximately (1) the proper arrangement of the airport, (2) checking the condition of the aircraft, (3) the skill of the pilot, and (4) the installation of radio and climate measurement charts. The Eurasia Company has paid great attention to and made every effort to plan for all the above points. The outstanding issues that need to be resolved will be decided at the board meeting in Beijing next week.</p>
