<h3 id="c19">吾人對於日犬養毅組閣應有之認識 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>以安達内相聯立内閣之主張之播盪。民政黨内閣終於不得不在閣内分裂之情勢下而宣告總辭職。復以政友會之堅决反對聯立内閣。而巡達之主張乃竟成一塲幻夢安達竟賣友被賣。犬養毅過橋拆橋繼若槻而組閣犬養毅今旣已正式拜命矣。新内閣名單亦已得核准。新内閣即將成立矣。在日本政治之舞臺上將有一時期政友會重新負荷其扮演歷史與時代戲劇之主角之任務。</p>
<p>我國人對於犬養毅之組閣或以其會贊助中山先生之革命運動即中山先生奉安時。犬養毅亦曾遠道來臨。而存有若干改進中日關係之幻夢。實則犬養毅雖對於中山先生有若干之私交然而吾人絶不容其政治背景爲政友會。而其所膺負之重任。則又爲政友會之總裁。假使吾人從歷屆政友會内閣對華政策之歷史。以及政友會不久以前。對於東北問題對華關係所發表之言論而觀。則兹後中日外交關係或倍多憂慮。而吾人之幻夢。或即將爲殘酷之事實所破滅。</p>
<p>政友會對華外交之一貫政策。爲絶對的强硬。爲絶對的武斷。此於政友會最近發表之一關於對中俄外交的聲明書」中。已完全顯露該聲明書中有云。「就外交上以觀察民政黨内閣之所爲。亦一如内政始終取消極的途徑。一以退嬰自屈爲能事、此則已爲衆目所均認。而於對華外交爲尤然。夫保持東亞全局一事。實爲明治以來我國之國是。亦即日華國交之基調。而現内閣似有已遺忘之感。」所謂保持東亞全局。爲彼國明治以來之國是。亦即爲政友會對華外交從不移易之一貫的政策。田中内閣時代對於我國之外交政策爲可如。國人應尚未忘却。兩次出兵山東。一手造成五三慘案。以一種極不名譽之手段。造成某一大案件。而所謂東方會議。旅順會議以及所謂對滿蒙積極政策。積極之行爲與毒辣之計劃。無不以保持東亞全局。對華外交强硬爲其基調。過去政友會内閣所給予我國之創傷。旣已如此而此次政友會對於民政黨内閣之攻擊。則更以對華外交輭弱爲題目。而主張極端强硬。新任拓務之泰豐助。甚且批評幣原外交爲第三者外交。謂幣原忘却其爲日本之當事者。而以第三者之地位自居。就兩方之言論。以作判斷。不將日本之權利利益放在眼中。「輭弱」之幣原外交。旣已實力發動强佔我東北半壁山河矣。是則較此輭弱外交而更爲强硬者究將何若。吾人當不難推知　　當萬寳山案發生之後政友會曾派森恪等往「鮮滿」一帶視察其視察報告。據電報所傳。則有謂「滿蒙中日官届之對立形勢極形嚴重此問題不解决。則難保不再發生第二第三之萬寳山事件。或較重之事件…無望解决之交涉案件達三百餘件。無論日本如何協調讓步中日關係亦難望合理之展開。」森恪非他。田中内閣時代之外務次官。而又爲本屆新内閣之書記官長也又如松岡洋右者。亦爲政友會之要人。「滿蒙通」之頭腦亦積極主張確立滿蒙政策謂日本曾費二十億之金錢。犧牲數十萬國民之生命而得滿蒙其有以主張殖民地之權利與資格。不在中國之下。或竟超過之此種剌激視聽之强硬主張。旣已推動民政黨内閣實際彈佔我東北矣然而在保持東亞全局之國是下。在北進之一貫在大陸政策下在東方會議旅順會議以</p>
<p>至田中積極政策下。政友會是否就此而心滿意足。而遂停止其對我侵略之步武。是否將更加緊實現其尚未實現之計畫。雖三尺童騃當亦可立即作答　　故吾人對於犬養毅組閣　事之觀察。當認爲一深關中日關係前途之一極可危慮之事件。以三井財閥及大地方軍閥爲背景之政友會其唯一之立足點。即爲背負軍國主義積極向外侵略。故目前政友會之重新組閣正所以顯示東亞之風雲將從此而益增重其險惡之形勢。</p>
<p>雖然日本　遂毫無足憂慮者乎。政友會之重新組閣事實上正所以顯示日本政治又折回反動之路軌。接受一般武人政客之强横主張而决意開時代之倒車。田中内閣武斷政策所造成之國際關係。以及國内專横獨斷之政治日人當亦未忘。以我東北之被强佔。太平洋上已呈山雨欲來風滿樓之情勢世界和平已置於斷續綫上。吾人深盼今兹成立之政友會内閣能一反其往常之政策。努力爲世界和平之保障者。而勿爲破壞世界和平之戰神與惡魔</p>

<p>日聯十三東京電　犬養政友會内閣已本於在野時之聲明、實行重禁金輸出、但其影響及於金融界與產業界者爲時甚暫、一般人士威爲日後發生之反動的不景氣之深刻憂慮、况且新内閣爲少數黨内閣因此於政策遂行上缺少圓滑、故將來不免因政情不安、以致人心動摇、日本財界對於新内閣之前途、皆抱不安之念、</p>

<p>國民社十三日東京電　日本此次民政黨内閣之崩倒、主要原因、由於黨中少壯派在安達領袖之下、不滿於老輩諸人、遂惜國難之名、竭力醖釀聯立内閣、迨日前元老西園寺抵東京、若槻進見後外間有西圓寺不贊成聯立内閣之說、旣而安達進見、第一次亦未接見、於是不無剌激、安達一派進行益亟相持、至前日若國内閣卒不得不出於總辭職一途、日皇諮詢西園寺後、乃召政友會領袖犬養毅組閣、顧焉友會雖藉安達一派倡聯立内閣、拆本黨之臺、始得秉政、乃犬養毅旣經受命、并與西園寺商榷之後、又主張組織純粹政友會内閣、安達至是進不能貫澈一己主張、退將不諒於本黨、失意之餘、聞現已與運動聯立内閣最力之富田中野兩氏决定脫黨、</p>

<p>路透社十三日東京電　據觀察時局者之意、政友會之組閣、似將引起不利之反響、且該黨在國會中地位頗弱、恐無應付現在醖釀中新政潮之能力、故衆信新閣壽命必不能久、僅屬過渡性質、將來終必組織聯立内閣、始能應付國家經濟財政政治之危局云、</p>

<p>丨樂華一鳴驚人丨</p>
<p>丨結果各獲一球丨</p>
<p>成　申江、日昨與曁南戰成零比零和局之東華足球隊、昨乂與樂華作高　杯二週賽於中華棒球場、結果或一比一和局觀衆八百餘人、一隊現本分勝負、將於最短期間、再决難雄、以定該杯之複賽權兹將詳情述下</p>
<p>上下古今談</p>
<p>東華隊人才濟濟、戰力强勁、名重一時之林肯隊、曾以二比四廿拜下風、前在西聯甲組賽中、東華亦曾以五比一戰勝業華、良以業華每况愈下不足稱道在西聯甲組中、每戰皆北、從未得分、即和局亦從未之有、以東華之威名、樂華固非其敵、故海上球迷、昨日皆裹足不前、不料劇戰結果東華　以一比一和之誠出人意料也、</p>
<p>東華之陣容</p>
<p>昨日之東華、陣容如舊無甚出入、僅由陳虞　缺席、由陳家球代行職權、家球之右翼、反較虞添出色、惟金元謙之右前衛、稍示軟弱耳、屠開元與陳璞、亦未見庭好表演、内衛半賽、主持大局、王長頴代關洵安、王亦平平、時見漏空、前鋒强固如昔、但未能有特殊健桔、良以藥華戒備嚴密無機可乘、</p>
<p>陳璞　錢敬鏞</p>
<p>李寗　李義臣</p>
<p>周賢言　屠開元　戴　經</p>
<p>王長頴　陳洪光</p>
<p>金元謙　陳家球</p>
<p>樂華之人才</p>
<p>樂華隊無藉藉名、故不爲人所重現、彼集合復旦與交通兩大學精鋭組織而成、後起之秀、前途是有厚望、昨日之表演、頗有可觀、守門陸鍾患風楓出足、救出險球不少、全隊僅孫惠培與陳韜、稍示軟弱、餘子均有可觀、前鋒萬象華與周紹文、時能深入敵營、惜以射門不佳、時失良檂、珠可惋惜、</p>
<p>顧尚勷　孫惠培</p>
<p>陸志明　萬象華</p>
<p>陸鍾恩　王樹淼　江潮</p>
<p>趙靄臣　周紹文</p>
<p>陳超　李琳</p>
<p>局勢之概觀</p>
<p>全局形勢、頗見平均、彼此機會均等、安危互有、開始後五分鐘時、東華即由戴麟經攻入一球、嗣後樂華常取攻勢、機會頻頻失去、至四十分鐘時、樂華藉任意球之機會、由萬象華頭頂　人一球、上半時成各一比數、下半時平安過去、各無所獲、結果遂成和局、</p>
<p>上半時各一</p>
<p>藥華開球、東華入兵進窺、陳家球傳送得法、戴麟經在門下攻門、被陸鍾恩放出、未幾、戴又盤球進攻、離門約十六碼處、遠射攻門、陸鍾恩正待接球、不料一陣狂風、將球吹向門角、穿人網中、陸轉身挽救、已不及矣、樂華失此球後、精神忽形振作、周紹文萬象華先後共有四次射門或被救出或出界外、均未得利、後陳璞在門前三十碼處手觸球犯規、樂華王樹森主踢、挑過東華後防、周紹文萬象華二人乘勢追上周賢言正欲救球、萬象華搶得優先、頭頂入門、而成一比一終了上半時</p>
<p>下半時平平</p>
<p>下半時起、樂華一鼓作氣、壓迫東華、精神極見抖擻、東華門前、大有草木皆兵之勢、樂華又在東華門前三十碼處踢任意球、王樹淼挑送得法、正對門中、周賢言前車可鑒、小心戒備、化險爲夷、東華至此、不稍放鬆、大有非勝不可之勢、戴麟經錢敬鏞均有打門、惜未命中、此來彼往、互見安危、四十五分鐘卒能平安　去、各無建樹、結果成比　和局而散、裁判員蔣湘靑</p>

<p>給徐君企周的一封信</p>
<p>我最近很歡喜研究自　科學，所以接到師範生月刋第二期，翻到您寫的「小朋友的鷄二篇文字便從頭到尾一口氣把它看完，覺得實在是好極了。您　　個初看很小的題目竟能引起小朋友一個個的把問題像珍珠樣滚下來，這是多麽姜麗的一種藝術呀！您抱着那一知之爲知之，不知爲不知」的態度來應付這些問題也是恰到好處，欽佩得很。　　我一面看這篇文字，一面覺得我自己好像也變了一位小朋友在您班上參加討論。我設身處地一想，假使并是你班上的、位小朋友，在這此問答之外，我還有什麽請敎的地方？我仔仔細細的想了一番，預備要提出兩個請求：　　（一）請求大家到了適當的時令便動手在學校裏或家裏孵鷄；　　（二）請求用科學的方法探求　鷄的道理。</p>
<p>敎育法的演進大概可以分爲四個階段：</p>
<p>第一個階段　憑先生敎授，不許學生發問；</p>
<p>第二個階段　師生共同討論：彼此質疑問難；</p>
<p>第三個階段　師生共同在做上學，在做上敎，在做上討論，在做上質疑問難</p>
<p>第四個階段　師生運用科學方法在做上追求做之所以然並發見比現在可以做得好一些的道理。</p>
<p>您自己在家裏養過鷄，可算是已經達到第三個階段。您的敎育法王這一課上所表現的祇可算是達到了第二個階段。我看您是一位很有希望的敎師，最好不要在這第二個階段上流連。您得立刻鼓起勇氣向第三和第四個階段進攻。</p>

<p>— 拯黎</p>
<p>明嘉靖時。倭寇後我崇明。知縣唐一岑死守縣城。以寡不敵衆。卒敗而死。時有秀才顧國𦒅聞城爲寇所攻。即率民兵多人。欲以助知縣。至則知縣死矣。城已破矣。顧乃大言於衆曰。知縣唐公爲民死。我輩亦以死報之時寇止破城而入。顧乃按劍與戰。不數時寇乃大敢而逃。殺倭賊二百餘。城乃復爲我有。守府某申聞於省曳。省令兵備道熊桴來崇察勘。知千户高某通賊。乃立誅之。知縣唐公以身殉城爲之請旌又以布帛奬顧氏民兵。次年倭寇犯太倉。熊乃請於顧曰。崇城之得免於禍。皆公之力也。今太倉危急。願公助我顧乃以民兵千人。長驅至太。一戰而敗之。迨　犯嘉定蘇州、顧又率民兵逐之。自後倭人遇崇明民兵。必懼而奔避焉。嗟乎顧國𦒅。我崇明之秀才。當其時崇人之爲秀才者衆矣。大率旨　唔呫嗶。攻其舉子之業。一聞兵戈之聲。輒蓄縮股慄。不敢越户限一步。而國𦒅獨2知大義。蹈死不顧。率民兵以戰勝倭寇。恢復城池。而鄰邑之寇。且藉其力以掃蕩之。其增我崇人之光榮。誠不少矣右今日本侵佔我東省。而東省之將吏竟不敢以一矢相遺。觀於顧國𦒅　事。能不愧死乎</p>

<p>日本所經營之南滿鐵道·視爲帝國侵掠我國關東三省之唯利源。故其推廣築路。不惜以暴力施行計畫。但就另一方　觀察。彼對於我國國有路線　伸展。實含非常之忌嫉。恒多方從事破壞。兹之所述。發生於民十八際。日人横用武力。拆毁我北寗支路。其野心可畏。足使聞者失色。特當時地方隱忍交涉不擴大耳。前年鐵道公報。曾載事之始末。余故舉而出之。俾關心日本暴行者得所採錄焉。</p>
<p>瀋陽自昔稱爲名勝之地。而城外皇陵。尤富古蹟。東曰福陵。距城約十餘里。有車軌接達瀋陽。便利游客。春秋佳日。裙屐紛來。其盛况不啻錢塘觀潮之專車也。北曰昭陵。與東北大學之鎭工塲相近。雖風景幽美。而往返不使。行旅惜之。前歲北寗路局。曾請准東北交通委員會。特闢昭陵支路。以相啣接。興工之際。路線進展。須經榊京農塲。此塲本屬昭陵附產。乃日人榊　串通守陵私行租用者也。日人從中阻難。因之横生枝節。嗣由交涉署據理力爭。始費金票十三萬元。將其贖歸。經此結束。以爲無事矣。不料日人猶不滿意仍謀破壞。突於某日自南滿路派遣大隊便衣守備隊及武裝軍警。威禁站長。散放步哨。將我國已築之路。實行掘毁。事後揚長而去。我國官廳迄無如之何也。斯際東北未亡。而日人之蠻横已如此。因知我國愈退讓。　奴愈進迫。退讓而不抵抗。結倮固未有不亡國者也。</p>
<h3 id="c92">女兒身 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 綺文女士</p>
<p>我國婦女在社會上的地位。向來是很卑賤的。從歷史上來觀察。大多數的婦女。總是做了男性們的玩物甚至奴隷。即使白樂天長恨歌中有着不重生男重生女的一句話。但是我們從他的立足點來說。這正可以代表中國歷史上婦女們所受到的整個的恥辱。所謂「女爲悅己者容這一句古諺是多麽的卑鄙啊。</p>
<p>到了現代　婦女運動的熱潮已經非常的高漲起來。但是我們也不能諱言。這表而上的光榮依然不能符合着實際上的收穫。大多數的農村婦女依然呻吟於舊禮敎的鐵蹄之下。過伊們奴隷樣的生活。而少數的小資產階級以上的婦女昵。也無非依然是抱着賣相主義。來做着男性們的玩物。比較學悟些的。祇是全婦女中的極少數的份子。力量十分微薄。成功自然難說了。</p>
<p>婦女地镁的提高。雖然還得靠我們自動的努力。但是在政治的方面。一國的政府。對於整個民權的維護。自不能不承認婦女們和男性們是應有平等的待遇的。即以我國而論。近年來國民政府對於婦女的權利。也很多明文的規定。便是在舊社會間所認爲公理的。女子不得承受遺產的一種謬見。也澈底的打破了。這自然是很有力量的一種啓示。而且也是我們自己的最勝利的收穫。</p>
<p>不過。舊社會間種種遺留着的殘酷的痕跡。至今還不能消除凈盡。每一個舊家庭中。幾乎隨時都有着和「提倡女權相背而行的怪劇發生。我最近曾見過明星影自公司一張新片·名字呌做「不幸生爲女兒身」的。便是綜合着許多舊家庭的怪劇。而給我們女子吐露出不秒的寃抑的故事描寫。</p>
<p>好像有顷多的問題。每個婦女們都得問問自己「爲什麽我國社會習慣重男輕女。「爲什麽男子要娶妾」。「爲什麽男子要誘引女子。」這許多問題。我們常常没有一個明確的答案。但是在不幸生爲女兒身」這一個影片裏、有了許多離奇而神妙的解釋。使我們初看時笑得噴飯。再想想却又要放聲大哭。</p>
<p>「不幸生爲女兒身。」也許是給我們女子來吐一口氣。我們希望他能夠來喚醒許多舊社會的迷夢。而給與婦女運動以一種有效的助力。我想凡是女子。應該去看一看。那　在受到種絮切的享樂之餘。就可以明瞭一部分的婦女運動的意義了。</p>

<p>卽在這天晚上。太陽國軍果然發動他們的暴行了。不斷的槍聲驚起了全校的學生。可是在黑夜不敢妄動。電話一個也打不通。只好關上校門。靜以待變。早上消息傳來了。許多赤心的學生。無不怒髮衝冠華乃强建議若太陽軍來侵犯學校。全體武裝防禦。不使越雷池一步。可是因爲别的關係。恐怕牽連。議論未决。而太陽軍已不速自至。衆同學遂只得各自逃生。此時忠淑　在樓頭。不及逃匿。祇好躱在室裏。不防太陽軍早已窺見。破門而入。他們瞧見忠淑美麗的容貌。動了妄念。要來暴行。在此千鈞一髮之時。兩個中倒了一個。不是忠淑中槍。乃是那個賊軍舉槍待發的時候。從忠淑所立的窗外。忽然飛來彈。正中那賊軍的頭顱。撲的倒地。接着跳進一個短衣少睥。大喝賊子安敢無禮。那一個太陽軍見同伴被擊。喫了一驚。連忙舉起剌刀來搠少年。被少年將手一揚。又是一槍。將那賊軍也擊死在地板上。此時忠淑認得那個少年便是華乃强。心中又驚又喜。華乃强從賊軍手裏取過盒子砲來。遞送給忠淑道。事情緊急。我們快快走罷。忠淑接過盒子砲。不暇詢問。隨着他　同跳出室門。悄悄地跑至樓下。聽得前面有太陽軍吆喝的聲音。忙向後邊奔跑。向圖書館背後繞過去。乃是一條小夾衖。衖盡處有一垜短牆。牆上生着些小草。靜悄悄的没個人聲。華乃强回頭說道。牆外使是曠野。我們可從這裏逃出去。忠淑立定了身子。只是躊躇。華乃强明白伊的意思。便走到牆下。將身一蹲道。你可立在我的肩上。我托你上去。忠淑也顧不得什麽了。便踏上他的肩頭。華乃强立起身來。忠淑兩手搭住牆篬。帶着盒子砲。身子望上一聳。華乃强趁勢把伊雙足一抬。忠淑早已扒上牆頭。見牆外乃是草也。便跳啊下去。華乃强也疾忙扒上短牆。正待下去的當兒。忽見一個太陽軍擎槍進來。砰的一聲。顆槍彈向華乃强飛至。（第二章完）</p>

<p>旅居海外檳榔嶼底朋友張掃軍、最近報告我該地瘋人院底情形、說在院治療的患麻瘋的病人、衣食住三者得以無憂外、得以參加游藝隊音樂底組織、和享受種植、畜牧、吸烟等底利便、不啻世外的樂園、我以該院底組織、很有造福於我們人類不中不幸而爲病廢的人、所以把它介紹在這裏、</p>
<p>檳榔嶼底木蒄山、最爲一般可憐的麻瘋病人底居留地、在該地底瘋人、除衣食住三者得以無憂外、還得醫生替他們診視、給以治療的藥品、據該地管理當局底報告、稱在一九三○年中、麻瘋病人底由該地私自逃出者、計有五十三人、死者一百二十五人、治愈釋放者四人、調往他處者一十六人、在這一年中所收容醫治者、總共有一千零五十八人、其中二百一十一人爲新進者、至一九三○年十二月三十一日止、計麻瘋病人登記底數目、爲八百六十人的、</p>
<p>在該地底範圍内、計有茅茨的營寨五十四所、每所居住二三人、計收容瘋人一百四十三人、每一茅寨底前面、有小草場一塊、以供瘋人漫步、至病人中能夠操作者、就鼓勵他種植蔬菓、因此在這年中、各茅寨底背後大都植着蔬菓、</p>
<p>在回居留地中、計有收容所十四間、每間收容二十餘人、計有病人三百八十四名、此中病人所患的麻瘋症、大都已到了第一期、而且多半殘廢、此外還有混血種人麻瘋收容所一間、計容一十六人、其中二人爲華僑士生、一人爲菲律賓產、至於新居留地中、現有收容所七間、計有病人三百·一十五名、其中有二百一十一人爲新進來的、在一九二九年中、該地病人祗有二百十八人、至一九三○年中、收容病人最多的數目的時期、爲七月七日、其時計有病人八百八十四名、</p>
<p>所有患麻瘋病底人、醫生分别察其病期的深淺、而篱以適宜的藥石、凡病重者、就把藥片給他吃、較輕者就施以注射的手術、總計一年中注射者、有五千八百七十一人之多、另有四人、因已全愈、就被釋放了、</p>
<p>在這居留地中、有游藝隊底組織、初發起時計有十四人、負敎練者爲一裹着傷的人、他們已經能作種種的游藝了、混血種人麻瘋所中、也有軍樂隊底組織、由居在所中底菲律賓人敎導、進步甚速、他們而且自備有樂器、在居留地、設立一養猪塲、每年供給附近居民底猪數計有一千隻、有些麻瘋病人、有吸鴉片底癮子、當局也曾分配給他們各若干、惟現已受政府命令、將分配數量逐漸减少、有吸鴉片癮者、計共二百九十五人、其中八十七人、每日僅須吸一次、八十七人、每日須吸二次、其他一百一十九人、則每日須吸三次、所有吸鴉片者、一概安置於舊居留地中、</p>
<p>到於病人中的健壯者、由政府給以一種工作、或由他自己種植蔬菓、及其他養猪等作業、所得報酬、概歸他自己、不能工作底病人、政府則每月發給津貼金一元、以作零星私費、於是這個麻瘋病人底居留地、不啻成爲世外底極樂園了、</p>
<p>本蒄山底麻瘋居留地、乃爲專門收容男性者、至於收容女性底麻瘋居留地、則設在日落洞那裏、總共有病人七十九名、其中有一十八人係新進者、也有四人</p>
<p>因已全愈、就被釋放了、其餘諸人底病勢、也有相當進步、在一年中、私自逃出者十人、死者八人、調往他處者四人、在一九三○年十二月三一日止、計共在所底女子、只有五十四人而已、</p>
<p>拯救可憐的殘廢瘋顚的人、是我們人類應有的同情與責任、願我們中國内對於不幸而爲瘋顚的人、也有像海外檳榔嶼底這種麻瘋病人居留地底組織、</p>

<p>Recognizing Japan's Provocative Intent</p>
<p>Unable to Endure Anymore, Secretly Plotting Response</p>
<p>Troops Stationed in Vladivostok Prepare to Mobilize</p>
<p>(Harbin) Russia is determined to issue a statement regarding Japan in the near future. The Russian Consul in Harbin, acting on orders from its government, has summoned consuls stationed in various parts of Northeast China to transmit a secret order. The Russian consuls in Dalian and Shenyang have both arrived in Harbin today. According to Russian sources, the Moscow government believes that Japan's construction of an airfield in Harbin clearly indicates a large-scale military plan and constitutes a challenge to Russia. Russia feels it can no longer endure this and will take appropriate measures to protect its rights. The Russian Consul in Harbin has been holding secret discussions for days, reportedly acting on orders from its government to discuss plans against Japan. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) White Russians in Harbin, finding the exercise of sovereignty by the Japanese Consul even more unbearable than being under Chinese rule, have mostly awakened and are unwilling to be puppets any longer. Semenov's representative has also returned to Dalian in disappointment. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Due to Japan's increasing encroachment on the rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Russia has decided to make a statement in the near future. Russian troops in Vladivostok are preparing to depart for the Four Stations area and are also levying military expenses from the public, charging one yuan per household. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Harbin) The Russian Consul in Harbin protested the Japanese construction of an airfield in Harbin, but has not received a reply from the authorities. However, the Japanese side has temporarily suspended construction. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) A Japanese aviation aircraft arrived in Harbin from Changchun at 10:00 AM today and landed at the aircraft factory on its maiden voyage. It carried eight passengers, all Japanese, and six pieces of mail. Upon landing, it prevented Chinese from watching closely. It flew back to Liaoyang at 11:30 AM. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Russian Consul in Harbin has protested to the authorities regarding Japan's construction of an airfield in Harbin, arguing that it hinders the transportation operations of the Chinese Eastern Railway and occupies Chinese Eastern Railway land. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Many soldiers are angered by Japan's construction of an airfield in Harbin. Today, several soldiers went to pull down the wooden stakes. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Military Conference Held in Hailun</p>
<p>Ma Expresses That He Will Not Change His Original Intentions</p>
<p>(Harbin) Zhang Jinghui is still not going to Heilongjiang in person. Instead, he has sent Ying Shun, along with the receiving committee members, to organize the provincial government. The Maintenance Association organized by corrupt officials in Heilongjiang has agreed to dissolve. Ying Shun is scheduled to return to Longjiang with the Heilongjiang representatives on the 15th to form the provincial government. As agreed between Ma Zhanshan and Zhang Jinghui, Ma will temporarily reside in eastern Heilongjiang, with Zhang providing everything. They will not interfere with each other.

At 10:00 AM, Ma Zhanshan and Zhang Jinghui began their talks in the office of the Harbin-Hai Railway Bureau Director. Troops from both sides were heavily guarding the inside and outside, and unauthorized personnel were not allowed to enter, creating a very tense atmosphere. Besides Ma and Zhang, Xie Ke and Xu Baozhen represented Ma's side, while Wei Shaozhou, Liang Yuxiang, Zhao Zhongren, Li Weizhou, and Jixiang represented Zhang's side. The discussions were extremely confidential and lasted for three hours. At 1:30 PM, Zhang left Songpu and returned to Harbin. The details of the meeting are unknown. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) At today's Ma-Zhang meeting, it is said that Zhang asked Ma to understand that his going to Heilongjiang was unavoidable. Instead of having Japanese troops permanently stationed in Heilongjiang, causing suffering to the people, it would be better for him to go and maintain order first. In the future, when the situation changes, Xiu Fang will return to Heilongjiang to govern. He has no intention of establishing his own territory. Ma said that he did not object to Zhang going to Heilongjiang, but there should be no Japanese interference in the government, and Japanese troops should retreat outside the city. The funds for his troops should not be withheld or diverted. There were many conditions attached, and Zhang promised to consider them after returning and reply later. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Having obtained Ma Zhanshan's understanding, Zhang Jinghui will soon go to Heilongjiang to govern. Ma Zhanshan returned to Hailun tonight. (11th Dispatch)</p>

Upon reaching the Fangtai Station on the way back, he received a phone call from Zhang inviting him to meet in Songpu, so he returned in the same car. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Ma Zhanshan returned to Hailun at 2:00 PM on the 11th. In the car, he told people that he had long intended to meet with Zhang. Although the results of this meeting cannot be disclosed, he will never change his original intentions and betray the expectations of the people. In any matter, he will prioritize nationalism and disregard personal interests. His previous meeting with Itagaki was also based on the principles of personal integrity and national interests. He would never do anything that would damage his integrity or harm the country. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a Harbin dispatch, Ma Zhanshan arrived in Songpu Town on the night of the 10th. On the morning of the 11th, Zhang Jinghui crossed the river to meet with Ma. Zhang asked Ma to consider the measures proposed by Itagaki, but Ma advocated delaying the discussion. Corrupt officials such as Li Yintang and Zhao Zhongren in Heilongjiang are strongly advocating for peace, making it difficult for Ma to deal with all parties. However, he is unwilling to yield. After the meeting, he returned to Hailun. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Ma Zhanshan Issues Circular Telegram Expressing Resolve <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Swearing Not to Yield While He Lives</p>
<p>Japanese People Should Reflect on Themselves</p>
<p>Hailun Ma Zhanshan issued a circular telegram on the 9th, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>To all newspapers and transmitted to newspapers in the East and West: Since the European War, enlightened individuals in various countries have lamented the mutual slaughter of mankind and realized the futility of military force. They have advocated principles of public justice such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the League of Nations Covenant as principles for resolving international disputes, seeking the well-being of the world's peoples to coexist and prosper together. The general trend and the progress of evolution will not allow the power politics of the 18th century, which took the annihilation of races, the destruction of countries, the invasion of territories, and the occupation of cities as its goals, to run rampant in the universe again. For whenever there are unequal disputes, they should be resolved through public justice. It is believed that good results can be obtained. Violence will ultimately succumb to public justice. The outcome of the European War is a clear example of this. How can it be that in the 20th century, Japanese militarists still only know the omnipotence of military power and have completely forgotten the public justice of mankind? Those warmongering soldiers, with nothing to justify their words, have insisted that the Chinese army destroyed the railway, so the Japanese army was acting in self-defense. Disregarding all peace treaties, they brazenly launched troops to attack Shenyang and Changchun. Our government, recognizing that the Japanese army is unreasonable, was sincerely afraid of triggering a great war in the East and falling back into a situation of mutual slaughter among mankind, and therefore avoided war in order to seek a decision based on public justice. The Japanese army, taking an inch, wants a mile, proceeded to occupy Shenyang and Changchun and to capture Jilin, using petty tricks to disrupt our politics. Abusive means have emerged one after another, and they still have not stopped. They have gone further and created extraneous issues, again with nothing to justify their words, and launched troops to invade our Heilongjiang Province. Our army, having no choice, has come forward with legitimate self-defense and engaged in combat. The course of all encounters with the enemy has been telegraphed and announced repeatedly, which I hope you have all heard. Now, there are still things that I cannot help but say, and I offer sincere advice to the enlightened people of the Japanese nation before the people of China and the world. Japan and our Republic of China are both located in East Asia, of the same race and the same culture, as closely related as lips and teeth. This is not only universally recognized by the world, but also self-recognized by the enlightened people of your country. China has a history of 4,000 years of civilization. In terms of the length of its culture, the size of its territory, and the size of its population, how does it compare to Japan? What Japan has surpassed China in since the Meiji Restoration of the past 60 or 70 years is the progress of science and the development of machinery. But if you think that by relying on this, you can destroy a great country with culture, nationalism, and the spirit of the nation, not only has there never been such a reason in ancient and modern times, but also the facts will not allow it. Moreover, even if China's national power is weak, the hot blood of the people still remains. The three northeastern provinces are an integral part of China's complete territory. Unless China is completely destroyed, the Chinese people will never allow the three northeastern provinces to be destroyed alone. For the sake of the Japanese authorities, you should think long-term. Whether you can truly destroy the three northeastern provinces depends on whether you can truly destroy China. If you may not be able to completely destroy China, then today's events are merely creating a basis for our nation to retaliate in the future. For the sake of the Japanese people, you should know how to conduct yourselves, so as to avoid creating evil karma, causing the Yamato people to be regarded as enemies by the world. After all, the rampant use of military power is not a blessing for the country. The mistake of Kaiser Wilhelm II toward the German people is a warning that is not far off. Zhanshan, a mere soldier, erroneously governs the province, feeling deeply the country's reliance on him above and being mindful of the great expectations of his compatriots below. Defending the territory is a divinely ordained duty, and self-defense is sacred. Because I could not bear to see the provincial capital suffer the devastation of war, I was unable to perish with the city. I feel unspeakable shame toward my fellow countrymen. Now, I am burdened with the excessive love of compatriots at home and abroad. Having received earnest exhortations and encouragement, and having received generous donations, with such righteousness, I will not refuse to die. I can only respectfully lead the people of my Heilongjiang Province to engage in self-defense. While I live, I vow not to yield. My determination to act in this way has been fully made. I respectfully swear this to my 400 million compatriots of the Republic of China. I beg you to consider it. Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, bows respectfully. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e19">Our Understanding of the Inuukai Cabinet in Japan <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The advocacy of an Inuukai cabinet led by Andachi, the Home Minister, gained traction. The Minsei Party cabinet finally had no choice but to announce its collective resignation amidst internal divisions. Furthermore, the Seiyukai firmly opposed a coalition cabinet, and Andachi's advocacy turned out to be nothing more than a dream. Andachi betrayed his friends and was betrayed. Inuukai swiftly crossed the bridge and dismantled it, succeeding Wakatsuki in forming a cabinet. Inuukai has now officially received his mandate, and the new cabinet list has been approved. The new cabinet is about to be formed. On the stage of Japanese politics, for a period, the Seiyukai will once again shoulder the task of playing the protagonist in the historical and contemporary drama.</p>
<p>Some in our country have harbored dreams of improving Sino-Japanese relations because Inuukai once supported Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary movement, and Inuukai even came from afar to attend Sun Yat-sen's funeral. However, we must not allow its political background to be the Seiyukai, and its heavy responsibility is to be the President of the Seiyukai. If we look at the history of the Seiyukai cabinets' policies toward China in the past, and the Seiyukai's recent statements on the Northeast issue and relations with China, then Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations may be a source of much greater concern in the future, and our dreams may be shattered by the cruel reality.</p>
<p>The Seiyukai's consistent policy toward China is one of absolute rigidity and absolute arbitrariness. This has been fully revealed in one of the Seiyukai's recent statements regarding diplomacy with China and Russia." The statement said, "Observing the actions of the Minsei Party cabinet in diplomacy is like its domestic affairs, always taking a negative path, making a virtue of retreating and yielding. This has been generally recognized by all, and it is especially true of its diplomacy with China. Maintaining the overall situation in East Asia is the national policy of our country since the Meiji era, and it is also the basis of Sino-Japanese relations. The current cabinet seems to have forgotten this." The so-called maintaining the overall situation in East Asia is their country's national policy since the Meiji era, and it is also the Seiyukai's consistent policy toward China, which has never changed. What was the foreign policy of the Tanaka cabinet toward our country like? The people of our country should not have forgotten. Two expeditions to Shandong, creating the May 3rd Massacre single-handedly, and creating a certain major incident through an extremely dishonorable means. The so-called Eastern Conference, the Lushun Conference, and the so-called active policy toward Manchuria and Mongolia, the active actions and vicious plans, were all based on maintaining the overall situation in East Asia and a rigid foreign policy toward China. The wounds that the past Seiyukai cabinets have inflicted on our country are already like this. The Seiyukai's attack on the Minsei Party cabinet this time has focused on the weakness of its foreign policy toward China and advocated extreme rigidity. The new Minister of Colonial Affairs, Tayama Suke, even criticized the Shidehara Diplomacy as third-party diplomacy, saying that Shidehara forgot that he was a Japanese party and positioned himself as a third party. Judging from the statements of the two sides, they did not put Japan's rights and interests in their eyes. The "weak" Shidehara diplomacy had already launched a forceful occupation of half of our northeastern territory. Then, what will a diplomacy that is even more rigid than this weak diplomacy be like? It is not difficult for us to infer. After the Wanbaoshan incident, the Seiyukai sent Mori Kaku and others to inspect the "Korean-Manchurian" area. According to the telegram, their inspection report said that the opposing situation of Chinese and Japanese officials in Manchuria and Mongolia is extremely serious. If this problem is not resolved, it is difficult to guarantee that a second or third Wanbaoshan incident will not occur, or an even more serious incident... There are 300 cases of negotiations that are hopeless to resolve. No matter how much Japan coordinates and concedes, it is difficult to hope for a rational development of Sino-Japanese relations." Mori Kaku is none other than the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs during the Tanaka cabinet and the Secretary-General of the current new cabinet. Another example is Matsuoka Yosuke, who is also an important figure in the Seiyukai. The "Manchuria-Mongolia expert" also actively advocated establishing a Manchuria-Mongolia policy, saying that Japan had spent 2 billion yen and sacrificed the lives of hundreds of thousands of its citizens to obtain Manchuria and Mongolia. Its rights and qualifications to advocate for its colony are no less than those of China, or even exceed them. This kind of strong advocacy that stimulates people's senses has already pushed the Minsei Party cabinet to effectively occupy our Northeast. However, under the national policy of maintaining the overall situation in East Asia, under the consistent policy of advancing northward on the mainland, under the Eastern Conference, the Lushun Conference, and the Tanaka active policy, will the Seiyukai be satisfied with this and stop its steps of aggression against us? Will it intensify its efforts to realize its plans that have not yet been realized? Even a three-foot-tall child can immediately answer this question. Therefore, our observation of the Inuukai cabinet should be regarded as an extremely alarming event that is deeply related to the future of Sino-Japanese relations. The Seiyukai, with the Mitsui Zaibatsu and large regional warlords as its background, has its only foothold in being burdened with militarism and actively carrying out foreign aggression. Therefore, the current re-formation of the Seiyukai's cabinet is precisely to show that the situation in East Asia will become even more treacherous from now on.</p>
<p>However, is Japan's path really free of cause for worry? The re-formation of the Seiyukai's cabinet actually shows that Japanese politics has once again turned back to the path of reaction, accepting the strong and arbitrary claims of the general military men and politicians and resolving to turn back the wheels of time. The international relations created by the arbitrary policies of the Tanaka cabinet and the domestic tyrannical and autocratic politics, the Japanese should not have forgotten. With our Northeast forcibly occupied, a storm is gathering on the Pacific Ocean, and world peace has been placed on a broken line. We deeply hope that the Seiyukai cabinet that is established this time can reverse its past policies and strive to be a guarantor of world peace and not be a war god and demon that destroys world peace.</p>

<p>Decision to Reimpose Gold Embargo, Financial Circles Uneasy</p>
<p>Adachi Betrays Party and is Sold Out, Leaving the Party</p>
<p>Dentsu 13th Tokyo Telegram: Inukai, President of the Seiyukai, was ordered to form a cabinet yesterday. At 10:00 am today, he submitted the list of cabinet members to the Emperor. The important cabinet members are as follows: (1) Yoshizawa Kenkichi, Ambassador to France and Representative to the League of Nations, was promoted to Minister of Foreign Affairs, with Uehara Etsujiro as Vice Minister; (2) Nakahashi Tokugoro as Minister of Home Affairs, with Matsuno Tsuruhei as Vice Minister; (3) Takahashi Korekiyo as Minister of Finance, with Horikiri Zenbei as Vice Minister; (4) Araki Sadao as Minister of the Army; (5) Osumi Mineo as Minister of the Navy; (6) Suzuki Kisaburo as Minister of Justice, with Okada Tadayoshi as Vice Minister; (7) Hatoyama Ichiro as Minister of Education, with Ando Masazumi as Vice Minister; (8) Yamamoto Teijiro as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, with Sunada Shigemasa as Vice Minister; (9) Maeda Yonezo as Minister of Commerce and Industry, with Yamaguchi Giichi as Vice Minister; (10) Mitsuchi Chuzo as Minister of Communications, with Wakamiya Sadao as Vice Minister; (11) Tokonami Takejiro as Minister of Railways, with Taki Kumejiro as Vice Minister; (12) Hata Toyosuke as Minister of Colonial Affairs, with Nakajima Chikuhei as Vice Minister; (13) Nagayo Ren as Superintendent General of Police; (14) Former Minister of the Army Minami Jiro and Former Minister of the Navy Ambo Kiyokazu were transferred to Military Councillors; (15) Morioka Jiro as Director of the Security Bureau; (16) Mori Kaku as Chief Cabinet Secretary; (17) Shimada Toshio as Director of the Legislative Bureau.</p>
<p>Dentsu 13th Tokyo Telegram: At 2:00 pm today, all cabinet members entered the palace to hold a swearing-in ceremony. Then, the first cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence. Minister of Finance Takahashi first reported the financial policy: First, it was decided to prohibit gold exports in order to increase the country's revenue; Second, the budget proposal will still be based on the decision of the previous cabinet; Third, Oppose increasing taxes. The financial resources will be supplemented by raising public debt. Also, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, which was originally scheduled to be abolished during the Wakatsuki Cabinet, was decided not to be abolished.</p>
<p>Nichi Ren 13th Tokyo Telegram: The Inukai Seiyukai cabinet has implemented the re-prohibition of gold exports based on its statements while in opposition. However, the impact on the financial and industrial circles will be very short. People generally fear the deep-seated economic downturn that will occur in the future. Moreover, the new cabinet is a minority party cabinet, so it lacks smoothness in policy implementation. Therefore, in the future, it will inevitably be shaken by political instability. The Japanese financial community is uneasy about the future of the new cabinet.</p>
<p>Kokumin Sha 13th Tokyo Telegram: The re-implementation of the gold embargo is the prelude to Japan's abandonment of the gold standard. It is found that existing Japanese gold worth 30 million Japanese yen has been loaded onto two ships, which are scheduled to set sail to the United States next Tuesday. Now that the ban on cash exports has been reimposed, it is unknown whether the cash on these two ships can be released. It is still uncertain. Since October of this year, the amount of cash Japan has shipped to the United States, including this 30 million yen, has reached a total of 33.4 million yen. However, the reserve of the Bank of Japan is now less than 30 million yen.</p>
<p>Kokumin Sha 13th Tokyo Telegram: The main reason for the collapse of the Democratic Political Cabinet of Japan this time is that the young and strong factions in the party, under the leadership of Adachi, were dissatisfied with the older generation and used the name of national crisis to vigorously brew a coalition cabinet. When former Elder Saionji arrived in Tokyo a few days ago, and Wakatsuki visited him, there was a saying that Saionji did not approve of the coalition cabinet. Then Adachi visited him, and he was not received for the first time, which was somewhat stimulating. Adachi's faction accelerated its progress and confronted each other, until the Wakatsuki cabinet had no choice but to resign en masse the day before yesterday. After Emperor Hirohito consulted Saionji, he summoned Inukai Tsuyoshi, the leader of the Seiyukai, to form a cabinet. Although the Seiyukai took advantage of the Adachi faction's advocacy of a coalition cabinet to dismantle its own platform, it was able to seize power. However, after Inukai Tsuyoshi was ordered and consulted with Saionji, he also advocated the organization of a pure Seiyukai cabinet. Adachi was unable to implement his own proposal to the end and would not be understood by his own party if he retreated. Out of frustration, he has reportedly decided to leave the party with Tomita and Nakano, who have been most active in promoting the coalition cabinet.</p>
<p>Nichi Ren Sha 13th Tokyo Telegram: Adachi, Tomita, and Nakano left the Democratic Political Party, and this was conveyed to President Wakatsuki by Rairaboku this morning. Wakatsuki accepted it. Young and strong Diet members who have the deepest relationship with Adachi are currently discussing the issue of advancing and retreating.</p>
<p>Nichi Ren 13th Tokyo Telegram: Elder Saionji left Tokyo for Okitsu at 10:00 this morning because the Seiyukai cabinet has been formally established.</p>
<p>Nichi Ren Sha 13th Tokyo Telegram: The Seiyukai held a general affairs meeting, a standing committee meeting, and a general meeting of members this afternoon, and issued a statement on the financial world and the current situation.</p>
<p>Nichi Ren Sha 13th Tokyo Telegram: The new Minister of the Army, Araki Sadao, is a lieutenant general of the army. He was born in Tokyo in 1877. At the age of twelve, he entered Sugiura Juku and was influenced by Japanism. Later, he was admitted to the Army Officer School and served as a second lieutenant of infantry, a military attache in Russia, a commander of the military police, the first director of the General Staff Headquarters, the president of the Army University, the commander of the Sixth Division, and the director of the Education Directorate. This time he was awarded the honorable position of Minister of the Army. Araki has been in Russia for fourteen years and has rich experience in long-term service there.</p>
<p>Nichi Ren Sha 13th Tokyo Telegram: Takahashi Korekiyo, the new Minister of Finance, does not want to stay in office for a long time. The government plans to promote Yamamoto Jotaro to Vice Minister of Finance so that he can succeed immediately when Takahashi resigns. However, Yamamoto declined to take office as Vice Minister.</p>
<p>Nichi Ren Sha 13th Tokyo Telegram: Secretary-General Kuhara based his stance on the memorandum to Adachi, met with President Inukai last night and strongly advocated the organization of a coalition cabinet. However, a separate inquiry by the Seiyukai appeared. Kuhara stated that he plans to resign from all official positions after the cabinet is established.</p>
<p>Reuters 13th Tokyo Telegram: According to observers of the current situation, the formation of the Seiyukai cabinet seems to be causing unfavorable repercussions. Moreover, the party's position in the Diet is weak, and it is feared that it will not be able to cope with the new political tide that is brewing. Therefore, it is widely believed that the new cabinet will not last long and is only a transitional nature. In the future, a coalition cabinet will eventually be organized to cope with the national economic, financial, and political crisis.</p>
<p>Kokumin 12th Washington Telegram: Washington officials do not want to criticize the changes in the Japanese cabinet. Other observers of the current situation mostly believe that this is Japan's internal affairs. However, after Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi comes to power, whether he will implement a more resolute policy towards China, people are guessing. Also, since Japan has now reimposed the gold embargo, people in New York are asking whether Japan will abandon the gold standard.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Basel Experts Committee: Intense Debate Between French and German Representatives <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>British Newspaper Discloses Secret U.S.-French Documents</p>
<p>Geneva (National News Agency, 12th): Today, during the meeting of the advisory committee here, representatives from Germany and France engaged in a fierce debate regarding the reparations issue. The cause stemmed from French representative Professor Lis expressing distrust of the educational and social expenditures listed by Germany, deeming them excessive and far exceeding those of France, particularly in the area of education. German representative Schüffler immediately responded, stating that Germany is an industrial nation, unlike France, which is primarily agricultural; the differences in public education and social costs are thus justified. The French representative declared that he could not accept this. The German representative retorted that France is a wealthy nation where citizens’ private wealth can cover part of the educational expenses, while Germany is impoverished, forcing the government to allocate more public funds to subsidize education. Furthermore, the majority of social expenditures are used for the relief of unemployed workers. The French representative also claimed this was excessive. The German representative stated that he hoped not to be overly pressured, as forcing the German government to reduce social spending would leave workers without relief, increasing unrest and inevitably affecting the nation's stability. Regarding the reparations issue between Germany and France, the New York correspondent for the London Daily Telegraph has obtained a secret memorandum from the French government to the French embassy in Washington, detailing France's attitude towards German reparations. After the London Daily Telegraph disclosed this document, Berlin newspapers reprinted it in full. The Berlin Daily News and others declared the secret document's authenticity. According to the secret memorandum, Germany should continue to be bound by the Young Plan. Any concessions granted to Germany due to its current difficulties should be considered temporary measures. Once Germany's crisis eases, it should resume reparations payments. Moreover, France's repayment to the United States must not exceed the amount Germany repays, and German private debt is not recognized as having priority in repayment.</p>

<p>Opposing Military Reduction</p>
<p>Paris (National News Agency, 12th): Today, Japan officially issued a declaration stating that it cannot reduce its military. Consequently, rumors of a secret cooperation agreement between Japan and France regarding military reduction have been confirmed. Japan's declaration came via a dispatch from Tokyo newspapers, stating that Japan cannot further reduce its land, sea, or air forces, and that its current military strength is only sufficient for national defense. French officials received this declaration with undisguised delight and even openly stated that France would no longer be in an isolated and helpless position at the disarmament conference, as France will also declare that its military is only sufficient for national defense. This clearly demonstrates the collusion between Japan and France.</p>

<p>Dissatisfied with the League of Nations' Handling of the Liaoning Case</p>
<p>London (Reuters, 12th): Last night, London held demonstrations concerning the Asian situation. Former Foreign Secretary Grey and Cecil, who returned from Paris yesterday, briefly addressed the crowd. Grey said that he believed it was a great mistake for those holding extreme views to point to the Manchurian Incident as proof of the League of Nations' uselessness. He recalled the situation before the Great War and often thought of the disputes that the Manchurian Incident could cause, and therefore felt fortunate to have the League of Nations. Japan may have reasons in Manchuria, but it is regrettable that it did not appeal to the League of Nations before taking military action. He believed that this action was inconsistent with the League of Nations Charter or the Nine-Power Treaty of Paris. Cecil spoke of the League of Nations' investigation team decided by the administrative council to be sent to Manchuria, saying that this investigation team had a great opportunity, and if it could proceed smoothly, it could permanently clear the war clouds in the Far East.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Japanese Forcibly Build Airfield in Harbin <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: This morning, a large number of workers gathered outside Daowai. It was heard that the Japanese had previously commissioned a Chinese person fluent in Japanese to claim that Japanese merchants were going to build an ice skating rink in the Majiagou area. Workers were paid six jiao (cents) in Harbin currency per day, while the foreman was paid one yuan per day, and he was entrusted to recruit workers. Because they had nothing to do, many workers went to apply upon hearing this news. In just half a day, more than two hundred and thirty workers were recruited in Daowai. They were then led by Japanese in plain clothes and Chinese who were fluent in Japanese, marching in groups through the streets of the Daoli district, heading straight for Majiagou. When they arrived near the Japanese elementary school in Majiagou, they saw two tall Japanese flags standing in the wilderness. Small flags were used to form a large square around the perimeter, several li (Chinese miles) long from east to west, and the same distance from north to south. More than a dozen Japanese police officers with guns patrolled and monitored the area, creating an intimidating atmosphere. The workers were confused and wondered why such a large ice skating rink was being built and what it was for. Later, they heard that the so-called ice skating rink was actually an</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>airfield. The reason they didn't say it was an airfield was because they feared that Chinese people would not go to work there. That's why they claimed they were building an ice skating rink. After the workers understood the truth, those with a bit of national consciousness wanted to quit. However, when they expressed this to the Japanese, they were refused. The workers had no choice but to endure and work. It was heard that the project was to be completed within a week. The day before the work started (the 6th), the Fourth Special Police Station received a phone call from their superiors, stating that "the Japanese plan to start building an airplane landing field in the Fourth Station's jurisdiction on the 7th. This airplane field is for landing transport planes and is intended to facilitate transportation and has nothing to do with military affairs. There is no need to stop it when the time comes to avoid misunderstandings. You are also instructed to inform the police station under your jurisdiction to be aware of this." This morning, Okano, who claimed to be the diplomatic director of the Japanese Consulate in Harbin, went to the Fourth Special Police Station and met with Director Yang, saying that "the Japanese are starting construction of an airplane landing field today. This airplane is purely for facilitating transportation, connecting directly to the routes between Fanyang and Qiqihar. This is a joint Sino-Japanese venture and there is a contract with your country's authorities. It is commercial in nature and organized in accordance with company regulations. The company is named Jiuda Company. In the future, please give your station more assistance." He then took his leave. Director Yang was ordered not to interfere, so he had no choice but to assign several patrol officers to be stationed near the field to show his willingness to help. The airfield occupies a large amount of civilian land, and the farmers who see this situation are extremely panicked. Yesterday, some were even heard crying loudly, saying that their lives were about to be ruined. It is said that after the Japanese build this airfield, they will transfer a large squadron of aircraft to be stationed here, so that they can take off from Harbin and fly along the Hulan River, which will soon be proven by facts.

<p>The Property Bureau Requests Installment Repayment of Advance Winter Grain Transport Funds: Lu Longxiang, the director of the Songjiang County Property Bureau, and others, stated that due to continuous rain disasters and then hurricanes this year, most of the crops in each district were reduced, the people's livelihood was declining, and they were already impoverished. The provincial government had previously sent personnel to assess the disaster and granted a reduction. The advance winter grain transport funds from previous years, which were originally scheduled to be repaid in installments, were postponed last year due to insufficient funds in the provincial treasury. Now that the grain tax collection is imminent, the provincial government cares about the people's livelihood and should be able to understand and accommodate the situation. Now, Shanghai and other counties have already submitted requests to implement the installment repayment of winter grain transport funds from previous years in the current season. The situation in this county is the same and should urgently follow suit. They requested the county government to forward the request to the provincial government to approve the verification of the original plan and continue to repay the advance winter grain transport funds in installments to relieve the people's suffering and maintain national credibility. County Magistrate Shen instructed the bureau to forward the request to the Finance Department and wait for instructions before complying. Please be informed.</p>
<p>The 15th District Requests the Finance Department to Exempt Grain Tax Collection: In the 18th year, the Finance Department ordered the county to implement the conversion of fields to grain transport. At the same time, Shao County, Jinshan, and Fengxian also received orders to collect grain tax. However, after repeated petitions from the people, personnel were sent to investigate and found that this county was completely fertile soil, while Jinshan and Fengxian were barren land, and they were granted a postponement, while this county was ordered to start collecting. The converted fields in this county are in the 15th district along the coast, bordering Jinshan and Fengxian. How could the soil quality be so different? The people in the district jointly filed a complaint, but the case has been pending for a long time and has not been resolved. At the fourth county administrative meeting last month, Yang Luming and 28 other township chiefs from the district made a suggestion, arguing that the land is located on the coast, the soil is barren and saline, the crops are not abundant, and the ports and waterways are shallow and narrow, so rice cannot be planted. The area of land is smaller than other districts, and the harvest is only a few dozen mu. The province ordered different measures to be taken in this district, which is far from the interior of Jinshan and Fengxian. They requested that the situation be forwarded for exemption. After discussion, the case was passed and forwarded. It is unknown whether the province will be able to heed the people's will.</p>

Chen Shengqiao chaired the meeting. They discussed whether the county should respond to the original student strike and decided to vote on it by roll call.

During the suspension period, no leave may be taken without reason, and commuting students must also come to school to work and stop all entertainment.</p>
<p>Cracking Down on Extortionists Who Threaten to Damage Seedlings: You Xueqiu, the owner of Yunji Flour Mill on Tonghui Road, Huinong Bridge, suddenly received a threatening letter a few days ago, demanding a loan of 500 yuan. You was extremely frightened. Upon careful examination, he traced the handwriting to Li Kunquan, a worker in the mill. He immediately took the letter to the sixth public security branch and reported it. The police arrested Li for questioning. Li's confession was evasive. He was immediately ordered to write a confession, and the handwriting was found to be the same. He was then sent to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Jiangdu Local Elementary Schools Still Unable to Resume Classes: The educational funding in Jiangdu is extremely scarce, so there are often strikes and demands for salaries. Currently, due to arrears in educational expenses, excluding the old debts, there are a total of nine months' worth, resulting in repeated suspensions of classes, which has not been resolved for six weeks. On the administrative side, the goal is to raise and distribute one month's expenses by the end of the year (estimated at 16,000 yuan). However, the teachers and staff aim to distribute three months' worth of funds at once, which is too far apart, resulting in a stalemate. It seems difficult to realize the resumption of classes this semester.</p>
<p>Difficult to Construct Riverbank Breaches Due to Freezing of the Canal: Since the 27 breaches in the canal, the people have been running around and appealing, hoping that the government will start construction as soon as possible to remedy the situation. However, although the government has stipulated four million yuan for the post-disaster construction funds, only one million yuan has been received to date, which is too far short of the target. Yesterday (the 11th), a strong northeast wind blew, and the entire canal froze very thickly. If the weather does not warm up, it will be difficult to start construction on the breaches for a while, and the people along the canal and those related to the canal bank are all worried.</p>

By the time people discovered him, he had already died of suffocation. The store immediately notified the deceased's family in You. The store paid 200 yuan to his family to purchase clothes and a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>Accusation Against County Magistrate Shen for Corruption: Shuyang County, which belongs to Hai Prefecture, is located in a remote corner. The county's governance has always been extremely dark. Since County Magistrate Shen Zhenjia took office in the county, in less than a year, there have been various acts of corruption and incompetence. He was accused by the people of Pu and said generally to the Civil Department of the Provincial Government that he employed incompetent people, violated the law, was corrupt, and extorted judicial and administrative registration, instructions, court hearings, service, and guard fees. He accepted bribes to release accumulated bandits Xu Zhaomin, Gan Junmo, and Hu Yingzhou. He also arbitrarily detained and fined good people by hand, releasing them immediately upon receiving money, so that there were no records or files to check. Recently, the original atmosphere has been very tense, and the document also contains the statement that "this beast will not stop until he is gone," which can also show the people's extreme disgust.</p>

<p>Bandit Leader Wu Tianbao Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday: The Zhejiang Provincial Government stated that Wu Tianbao, the bandit leader from Fenghua, also known as Wu A'gen and Wu Binghui, had colluded with bandits Jiang A'xing, Lin Si'hu, and more than 30 others in the 17th year of the Republic of China, each carrying firearms, to carry out arson and robbery in Fenghua, turning the entire town into scorched earth and killing the company commander and several soldiers of the Provincial Merit Army.

<p>Three Types of Public Bonds Extended for Repayment: The Zhejiang Provincial Rehabilitation Public Bond will reach its final repayment period this year, and the repayment date is set for December 15th. At the same time, there are also two old public bonds for reorganization and repayment that should be repaid with interest, totaling tens of thousands of silver dollars in interest payments. The Finance Department believes that the current financial situation has reached a desperate situation and it is difficult to cope. Therefore, it has sent separate letters to the three public bond funds, approving a half-month extension for repayment.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Outline of National Salvation Activities for Elementary Schools, by Chen Pin-yi <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the national crisis, many national salvation activity plans for elementary schools have been published by the education sector. However, upon closer examination, these documents mostly list activities directly. The authors inevitably omit or overlook details, or they are too superficial. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education initiated the Shanghai Municipal Elementary and Secondary School National Humiliation Eradication and National Salvation Center Activities. Due to my duties, I gathered the opinions of colleagues within the school and considered educational principles and the current situation with the goal of carefully implementing this work. Based on the pragmatist principles of "this time" and "this place," I drafted a general implementation plan. The implementation process has proven to be useful. I am now publishing it to study together with colleagues in elementary education on the implementation plan for the National Humiliation Eradication and National Salvation Center Activities.</p>
<p>Purpose: Implement nationalist education, inspire and cultivate children's patriotic thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>Implementation Principles: Taking the resistance against Japan and national salvation as the goal, teaching and guidance as the tools, and children as the objects, reasonable stimulation will be applied to obtain appropriate responses.</p>
<p>Activity Outline</p>
<p>Implementation Period: Starting from September 23 (the date of the national mourning assembly ordered by the central government), with a period of one month. Extension is possible if necessary.</p>
<p>Points to Note During Implementation</p>
<p>(1) Guiding Children's Thoughts: (1) Promote the essence of nationalism to strengthen children's determination to unite and save the nation; (2) Promote the essence of "benevolence" and "humanity" to cultivate children's concept of defending "justice"; (3) Introduce the attitudes of various countries around the world towards the events in the Northeast to cultivate children's international perspective.</p>
<p>(2) Guiding Children's Emotions: (1) Arouse children's sense of vigilance, but avoid fear; (2) Inspire children's high-spirited emotions, but avoid impulsiveness; (3) Train children's calm attitude, but avoid pessimism.</p>

<p>Dismissal of Two Directors Untrue</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the students of National Central University petitioning the Ministry of Education, a reporter specifically went to the Ministry to meet with Directors Jiang and Sun. According to them, "The three points raised by the students of National Central University during their petition to the Ministry were: (1) Revoke the order for early holidays; (2) Approve Zhu Jia-hua's resignation; (3) During the transition period, the Ministry should order professors to manage the school. At the time, the Vice Ministers were not at the Ministry, so the two of us went out to meet the students successively. Regarding the first point, because the Ministry did not indeed have an order for early holidays, we told them the truth. Regarding the second and third points, we agreed to convey these intentions to the Minister and have the Ministry forward them to the National Government for approval. The students proposed a written reply, so the two of us signed and sealed the reply, which the students found satisfactory and returned to school together. Later, we reported the process to the Vice Ministers, who informed us that Minister Li had already sent a handwritten note to President Zhu on the evening of the 8th regarding the matter of ordering early holidays for Central University, and stated that a formal order would be issued the next day. Because the Minister was attending a meeting at the Central Party Headquarters, he did not inform the Higher Education Department about the handwritten note he had sent, so the Higher Education Department was completely unaware. The formal order was indeed only completed and delivered to Central University at 5 PM on the 9th.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Political News Agency published news the day before yesterday, stating that Director Sun Ben-wen of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education had resigned to take responsibility and had been approved, but the successor had not yet been announced. It was also rumored that Director Jiang Shao-mo of the General Affairs Department also intended to resign. According to a statement from the responsible personnel of the Ministry of Education, both of these news items are untrue. Directors Sun and Jiang are still performing their duties as before and have not resigned to the Ministry."</p>

<h3 id="e85">The Second Week of the Senior Cup: Donghua vs. Lehua <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>| Lehua's Amazing Performance |</p>
<p>| Result: One Goal Each |</p>
<p>Yesterday, Donghua Football Team, which drew a 0-0 tie with Jinan in Shenjiang, competed in the second week of the Senior Cup against Lehua at the Zhonghua Baseball Field, resulting in a 1-1 draw. Over eight hundred spectators attended. The two teams are currently tied, and will re-resolve the outcome as soon as possible to determine the right to re-compete for the cup. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Chatting about the Past and Present</p>
<p>The Donghua team has a wealth of talent, strong combat strength, and a well-deserved reputation. The Lincoln team was defeated by a score of 2 to 4. Previously, in the Western Union A Group competition, Donghua also defeated Yihua by a score of 5 to 1. Yihua has been steadily declining and is not worth mentioning. In the Western Union A Group, they have been defeated in every match and have never scored; even a draw has never happened. Given Donghua's prestige, Lehua was certainly not their opponent, so Shanghai football fans did not expect to see this. Unexpectedly, the fierce battle resulted in Donghua drawing with them at 1 to 1.</p>
<p>Donghua's Lineup</p>
<p>Yesterday's Donghua's lineup remained unchanged, with no major changes. Only Chen Yutian was absent, replaced by Chen Jiaqiu. Jiaqiu's right-wing performance was even better than Yutian's, but Jin Yuanqian's right midfielder was slightly weak. Tu Kaiyuan and Chen Pu also did not show a good performance. The internal guards controlled the overall situation for half the game. Wang Changying replaced Guan Xun'an, and Wang's performance was mediocre, occasionally leaving gaps. The forwards were as strong as ever, but they were unable to achieve any special success because Lehua's defenses were tight and there was no opportunity to be taken.</p>
<p>Chen Pu Qian Jingyong</p>
<p>Li Ning Li Yichen</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan Tu Kaiyuan Dai Linjing</p>
<p>Wang Changying Chen Hongguang</p>
<p>Jin Yuanqian Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>Lehua's Talent</p>
<p>The Lehua team has no well-known names, so it is not valued by people. It is an emerging force formed by the elites of Fudan and Jiaotong Universities, and there are high hopes for its future. Yesterday's performance was quite remarkable. Goalkeeper Lu Zhonghuan performed admirably, saving many dangerous balls. Among the entire team, only Sun Huipei and Chen Tao showed some weakness, while all other players were remarkable. Forwards Wan Xianghua and Zhou Shaowen were able to penetrate the enemy camp from time to time, but they missed good chances due to poor shooting, which was regrettable.</p>
<p>Gu Shangrang Sun Huipei</p>
<p>Lu Zhiming Wan Xianghua</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen Wang Shumiao Jiang Chao</p>
<p>Zhao Aichen Zhou Shaowen</p>
<p>Chen Chao Li Lin</p>
<p>Overview of the Situation</p>
<p>The overall situation was quite balanced, with equal opportunities for both sides and mutual dangers. Five minutes after the start, Donghua scored a goal by Dai Linjing. Afterwards, Lehua often took the offensive, but opportunities were frequently lost. By the fortieth minute, Lehua took advantage of a free kick and Wan Xianghua headed the ball into the net, making the score 1-1 in the first half. The second half passed peacefully, with nothing gained. As a result, a draw was made.</p>
<p>One Goal Each in the First Half</p>
<p>Lehua kicked off, and Donghua's soldiers advanced to spy. Chen Jiaqiu's passes were effective, and Dai Linjing shot at the goal, but it was released by Lu Zhongen. Before long, Dai dribbled the ball and attacked, shooting from about 16 yards from the goal. Lu Zhongen was about to catch the ball, but a gust of wind blew the ball towards the corner of the goal and into the net. Lu turned to save, but it was too late. After losing this goal, Lehua's spirit suddenly rose. Zhou Shaowen and Wan Xianghua had a total of four shots, but they were either saved or went out of bounds, and they did not gain any advantage. Later, Chen Pu touched the ball with his hand in front of the goal at 30 yards, committing a foul. Lehua's Wang Shusen took the free kick and lobbed it over Donghua's defense. Zhou Shaowen and Wan Xianghua seized the opportunity and chased after it. Zhou Xianyan was about to save the ball, but Wan Xianghua gained priority and headed the ball into the goal, making it 1-1 and ending the first half.</p>
<p>The Second Half Was Uneventful</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Lehua went all out and pressed Donghua. The spirit was extremely invigorated. In front of Donghua's goal, there was a sense of tension. Lehua took another free kick 30 yards from Donghua's goal. Wang Shumiao's lob was effective and aimed directly at the goal. Zhou Xianyan took a lesson from the past and was careful to guard against danger. Donghua did not relax at this point, determined to win. Dai Linjing and Qian Jingyong both had shots, but they did not hit the target. Back and forth, they saw each other's safety. Forty-five minutes passed peacefully, with no achievements. In the end, it ended in a draw. The referee was Jiang Xiangqing.</p>

<h3 id="e88">The Children's Chicken (Part 1) <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>A Letter to Xu Junqi Zhou</p>
<p>I recently enjoyed studying natural science very much, so when I received the second issue of the Normal School Student Monthly, I turned to your "The Children's Chicken" and read both articles from beginning to end in one breath. I felt that they were extremely good. That a topic that seemed so small at first could provoke children to roll out questions like pearls, one after another, is such a beautiful art! I greatly admire your attitude of "knowing what you know, and admitting what you don't know" in responding to these questions. As I read the article, I felt as if I had become a child in your class, participating in the discussion. I put myself in that position and wondered, if I were a child in your class, what else would I like to ask? I thought about it carefully and prepared to make two requests: (1) Ask everyone to start hatching chickens at school or at home when the time is right; (2) Ask to explore the principles of chickens using scientific methods.</p>
<p>The evolution of educational methods can be roughly divided into four stages:</p>
<p>The first stage: Relying on the teacher to teach, not allowing students to ask questions;</p>
<p>The second stage: Teachers and students discuss together; questioning and challenging each other;</p>
<p>The third stage: Teachers and students learn by doing, teach by doing, discuss by doing, question and challenge each other by doing;</p>
<p>The fourth stage: Teachers and students use scientific methods to pursue the reason for doing, and discover ways to do better than now.</p>
<p>You have raised chickens at home yourself, so you can be considered to have reached the third stage. Your educational method, as expressed in this lesson, can only be considered to have reached the second stage. I think you are a very promising teacher. It is best not to linger in this second stage. You must immediately muster the courage to advance to the third and fourth stages.</p>
<h3 id="e89">The Chongming Man Who Vanquished the Japanese Pirates <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Zēng Lí</p>
<p>During the Jiajing era of the Ming dynasty, Japanese pirates invaded my Chongming. The magistrate, Tang Yicen, defended the county seat to the death. Outnumbered, he was ultimately defeated and died. At the time, a scholar named Gu Guoxuan heard that the city was under attack by the pirates. He immediately led many local militiamen, intending to assist the magistrate. Upon arrival, he found that the magistrate was dead and the city had already fallen. Gu then declared loudly to the crowd, "Magistrate Tang died for the people. We should also repay him with our lives!" At that time, the pirates had only broken into the city. Gu, drawing his sword, engaged them in battle. Before long, the pirates were greatly terrified and fled, leaving behind over two hundred dead. The city was then recovered by us. The governor reported the matter to the provincial government. The province ordered the military commissioner, Xiong Fu, to come to Chongming for inspection. Discovering that the battalion commander, Gao, was colluding with the pirates, he had him executed immediately. He petitioned for an honorary commendation for Magistrate Tang, who had died defending the city, and awarded cloth and silk to Gu's militia. The following year, the Japanese pirates invaded Taicang. Xiong then appealed to Gu, saying, "Chongming was spared from disaster entirely thanks to your efforts. Now Taicang is in critical danger. I implore you to assist me." Gu then led a thousand militiamen straight to Taicang and defeated the pirates in a single battle. When the pirates invaded Jiading and Suzhou, Gu again led the militia to pursue them. From then on, the Japanese pirates, upon encountering the Chongming militia, would invariably flee in fear. Alas, Gu Guoxuan, the scholar of my Chongming! At that time, there were many scholars in Chongming. Most of them cared only about their literary pursuits, grumbling about the work required to pass the imperial examinations. At the first sound of battle, they would cower in fear, not daring to step beyond their doorsteps. Gu Guoxuan alone understood the greater righteousness, disregarded death, and led the militia to defeat the Japanese pirates and recover the city. Moreover, neighboring towns relied on his strength to eliminate the pirates. His actions greatly increased the glory of my Chongming people. Now, Japan is invading and occupying our Eastern Provinces, yet the generals and officials of the Eastern Provinces do not dare to retaliate with a single arrow. Considering the actions of Gu Guoxuan, how can they not be ashamed to die?</p>

<p>The Speed of Clothing Manufacture From the moment the wool is sheared from the sheep until the garment is finished, the fastest record has been held by the Americans, at six hours and four minutes. No one could match their speed. The British, not to be outdone, quickly caught up, achieving a time of three hours, twenty minutes, and thirty seconds, nearly twice as fast as the Americans. However, they were still not satisfied and sped up their process even further. Within days, they shaved off another hour, maintaining a record of two hours, nine minutes, and forty-six seconds to this day. This record seemed likely to stand for some time, with no one to surpass it. Who knew that it would soon meet a formidable opponent and be easily defeated by Australia? They sheared the wool from the sheep, wove the fabric, and made the clothes, completing all the work in just one hour, fifty-one minutes, and eighteen and a half seconds. This is truly like riding a special express train, leaving others in the dust. To catch up, one would need an airplane.</p>

<p>— Lǚ Bīng</p>
<p>The South Manchuria Railway, operated by Japan, is regarded as the sole source of profit for the empire's invasion of our Northeast Three Provinces. Therefore, they are willing to use violence to implement their road-building plans. However, from another perspective, they harbor extreme jealousy towards the extension of our nation's state-owned routes and constantly engage in sabotage. What I am about to describe occurred around 1929, when the Japanese used military force to demolish the Beining branch line, revealing their frightening ambition, enough to shock those who hear of it. However, at the time, local authorities exercised restraint and negotiated to prevent escalation. The Railway Gazette published an account of the incident in the previous year. I am therefore bringing it up now so that those concerned about Japanese atrocities may have it recorded.</p>
<p>Shenyang has long been known as a scenic spot, and the imperial tombs outside the city are particularly rich in historical sites. The eastern tomb, Fuling, is about ten miles from the city and is accessible by rail, making it convenient for tourists. On pleasant days in spring and autumn, crowds flock there. The scene is no less lively than the special train for watching the Qiantang River tidal bore. The northern tomb, Zhaoling, is close to the Zhen Gong Chang of Northeastern University. Although the scenery is beautiful, the travel back and forth is inconvenient, which travelers regret. The year before last, the Beining Railway Bureau obtained approval from the Northeast Transportation Committee to build a Zhaoling branch line to connect with it. During construction, the route had to pass through the Sakai Farm. This farm originally belonged to the Zhaoling subsidiary, but a Japanese named Sakai, in collusion with the tomb guards, privately leased it. The Japanese obstructed the project, causing complications. Subsequently, through reasoned arguments from the Diplomatic Affairs Office, a sum of 130,000 silver dollars was spent to redeem it. With this settled, it was thought that the matter was over. Unexpectedly, the Japanese were still dissatisfied and sought to sabotage the project. Suddenly, on a certain day, they dispatched a large team of plainclothes guards and armed military police from the South Manchuria Railway. They forcefully detained the stationmaster, deployed sentries, and demolished the already constructed road. Afterwards, they left triumphantly. Our government authorities could do nothing about it. At this time, the Northeast had not yet fallen, and the barbarity of the Japanese was already like this. It is clear that the more our country retreats, the more the enemy presses forward. To retreat without resistance is sure to lead to national subjugation.</p>
<h3 id="e92">A Daughter's Life <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Qǐ Wén Nǚshì</p>
<p>The status of women in our country's society has always been very low. Looking back at history, most women have always been treated as playthings or even slaves by men. Even though Bai Juyi's "Song of Everlasting Regret" contains the line "Do not value the birth of sons, value the birth of daughters," from his perspective, this precisely represents the shame women have suffered throughout Chinese history. How despicable is the ancient proverb, "A woman adorns herself for the pleasure of her man."</p>
<p>In modern times, the women's movement has become very popular. However, we cannot deny that this superficial glory still does not match the actual gains. Most rural women still groan under the iron heel of the old ethics, living lives of slavery. And the few women above the petty bourgeoisie are still holding onto the idea of selling their appearance, acting as playthings for men. Those who are more enlightened are only a very small minority of all women, and their strength is very weak, so success is naturally difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>The elevation of women's status still depends on our own active efforts. However, in the political aspect, the government of a country, for the sake of safeguarding the entire civil rights, must recognize that women and men should have equal treatment. Even in our country, the National Government has made many explicit provisions regarding the rights of women in recent years. Even the misconception that was considered a principle in the old society that women should not inherit property has been completely broken. This is naturally a very powerful inspiration, and it is also our most victorious gain.</p>
<p>However, the cruel traces left over from the old society have not yet been completely eliminated. In almost every old family, there are almost always strange dramas that run counter to the advocacy of women's rights. I recently saw a new film from the Star Film Company, called "Unfortunately Born a Daughter," which is a compilation of many strange dramas of old families, and depicts the story of women's repressed grievances.</p>
<p>It seems that there are many questions that every woman must ask herself: "Why is our society accustomed to valuing men over women?" "Why do men take concubines?" "Why do men seduce women?" We often do not have a clear answer to these many questions. However, in "Unfortunately Born a Daughter," there are many bizarre and wonderful explanations, which make us laugh so hard when we first see them, but then we want to cry out loud.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately Born a Daughter" may be to let our women let out a sigh of relief. We hope that it can awaken many illusions of the old society and give an effective help to the women's movement. I think every woman should go and see it, so that after receiving the enjoyment of some of the plot, they can understand part of the meaning of the women's movement.</p>

<p>Cen Chi (Part 1)</p>
<p>In past dynasties, there were hermits, but none quite like the one I will speak of in modern times. Dwelling in mountain springs, with eccentric habits different from the masses, I have found such a person. His name is Cen Chi, style name Shengzhi, from Shaoxing, Zhejiang. He is a registered student, well-versed in various books, and writes prose that is elegant and readable. He can compose ten thousand words in a short time, as if divinely assisted. His calligraphy is also outstanding. Moreover, he is skilled in cooking and sewing. He is capable in every way. His family was poor, so he made a living with his pen in various places. He once traveled thousands of miles to visit a relative in Jiangxi, who was working on something in Xincheng. Xincheng is our hometown, east of Ganzhou, surrounded by overlapping mountains, with narrow roads difficult for travelers. By the time Chi arrived, the person had already gone to the provincial capital, leaving Chi disappointed. Traveling was expensive, and he had no food or lodging. In a dilemma, he offered his skills in making clothes to the local tailors, hoping to gradually accumulate funds and then return to his hometown. The tailors, seeing his handsome appearance, did not believe him. However, they then saw him holding a needle and scissors, working as if he had practiced it for a long time. Surprised, they asked Chi about his background. Chi sighed and said, "Things have turned out unexpectedly. I had no choice. That I have fallen to this state can be said to be a calamity sent by Heaven." The tailor said, "Upon first meeting you, I recognized you as an extraordinary person. It turns out my eyes did not deceive me. You are a man of accomplishment. Take it easy and don't worry. The day when the dragon breaks through the wall will come." At that time, my late uncle Bao Shan (Jingmo), the Provincial Surveillance Commissioner of Gansu, had requested to retire due to illness and was about to spend the rest of his life in his hometown. During the New Year, he was visiting people when he saw a spring couplet on the door of a certain house. The wording was elegant and relevant, and the calligraphy was lively, seeming to dance. He judged that it could only have been written by a person of high talent and was very surprised. My late uncle and Lu Zhiyou (Qiguang) were known for their calligraphy. They often visited relatives and friends in the village, and he could recognize the handwriting of all the people. This was someone he had never seen before. Many local celebrities praised the work. In the end, they could not find out who it was. So he asked the owner of the house. The owner said, "This was written by a famous scholar. Even his casual conversation is extraordinary, and his handwriting is even more refined. It is fitting that you see it and praise it. He is currently stranded here and initially made a living as a tailor. Judging by his words and actions, he is not only a scholar but also a man of talent and a rare person. I have already treated him with the respect due to a teacher. He is about to return to Yue. You must meet him." My late uncle said, "Tonight, I will have the cook prepare a feast and wait for you to invite the old gentleman to come and chat." At dusk, the person came with Chi, delighted. Tall and slender, with an elegant bearing, they were seated. The host and guest regretted that they had not met sooner and discussed the classics of history and literature, as well as the way of painting and calligraphy. Everything Chi said was relevant. Finally, he described his family history in great detail. He was asked if he was married. He said no. My late uncle said, "This is a heaven-sent opportunity. My youngest daughter is not yet betrothed. She is talented, virtuous, and beautiful. Would she be suitable for you?"</p>

<p>Chapter Two: Like-Minded</p>
<p>That very evening, the soldiers of the Sun Country indeed launched their atrocities. The continuous gunshots startled all the students in the school. But in the darkness, they did not dare to act rashly. None of the telephones could get through. They had no choice but to close the school gates and wait quietly for what might happen. The next morning, the news spread. Many patriotic students were enraged. Hua Naiqiang suggested that if the Sun Country soldiers invaded the school, everyone should arm themselves and defend it, not allowing them to cross the line. However, because of other considerations, they were afraid of being implicated. While the discussion was still unresolved, the Sun Country soldiers arrived uninvited. The students had no choice but to flee for their lives. At this time, Zhongshu was in the upper floor and did not have time to escape. She had no choice but to hide in the room. Unexpectedly, the Sun Country soldiers had already spotted her. They broke down the door and entered. They saw Zhongshu's beautiful face and had evil thoughts. They wanted to commit violence. At this critical moment, one of them fell. It was not Zhongshu who was shot. It was when the soldier was raising his gun to fire that a bullet suddenly flew in from the window where Zhongshu was standing. It hit the soldier's head squarely. He fell to the ground with a thud. Then a short-clothed young man jumped in and shouted, "How dare you scoundrels be so rude!" The Sun Country soldier saw his companion shot and was shocked. He quickly raised his bayonet to stab the young man. The young man raised his hand and fired another shot, killing the soldier on the floor as well. At this time, Zhongshu recognized the young man as Hua Naiqiang. She was both surprised and delighted. Hua Naiqiang picked up the Mauser pistol from the soldier's hand and handed it to Zhongshu, saying, "The situation is urgent. Let's leave quickly." Zhongshu took the Mauser pistol without asking any questions. She followed him and jumped out of the room, running quietly downstairs. Hearing the sound of Sun Country soldiers shouting in front, they hurried to run to the back, around the back of the library. There was a small alleyway. At the end of the alleyway was a pile of short walls with some weeds growing on them. It was quiet and deserted. Hua Naiqiang turned his head and said, "Outside the wall is the wilderness. We can escape from here." Zhongshu stood still, hesitating. Hua Naiqiang understood what she meant. He walked to the wall and squatted down, saying, "You can stand on my shoulders. I will lift you up." Zhongshu did not care about anything else. She stepped on his shoulders. Hua Naiqiang stood up. Zhongshu grabbed the top of the wall with both hands. Carrying the Mauser pistol, she raised her body. Hua Naiqiang took the opportunity to lift her feet. Zhongshu had already climbed over the wall. Seeing that outside the wall was a grass field, she jumped down. Hua Naiqiang also hurriedly climbed onto the short wall. Just as he was about to go down, he suddenly saw a Sun Country soldier coming in with a gun. With a bang, a bullet flew towards Hua Naiqiang. (End of Chapter Two)</p>

<h3 id="e95">Gold Prices Fell Last Week in the Financial Market <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Fluctuations Reached 60 Taels</p>
<p>Decline of 31.2 Taels</p>
<p>Reaction After Three Weeks of Rise In the past week, spot gold prices resumed their downward trend, a reaction from the three consecutive weeks of gains. However, the ever-changing situation was confusing, with no clear direction. The market was turbulent, with daily fluctuations of more than 20 taels, which was truly bewildering to investors. The market was weak from the beginning of the week, then fluctuated around 700 taels, as various unfavorable news from home and abroad spread. Only on Thursday did it rise to 708 taels. Subsequently, due to the sudden resignation of the Japanese cabinet and rumors of renewed gold export bans and abandonment of the gold standard, the market plummeted, with a catastrophic fall of 30 taels to a low of 649 taels. The total fluctuation for the week was 60 taels. By the end of the week, the market recovered slightly, with a net decline of 31.2 taels. Overseas silver markets and Shanghai's British and American exchange rates had increased. Bank trading prices of British gold exceeded 2 shillings, and US gold reached 34 yuan. Chinese merchants varied in their positions, with many remaining short. The brokers generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude. However, with the volatile situation, there was concern that the future would remain bleak. Initial margins ranged from 70 to 80 taels, then 50 to 60 taels, and even 100 taels at most, eventually settling around 70 taels. The delivery of physical gold was smooth, with raw gold increasing by about 6 taels. Yesterday (November 11), the silver report shrank, and today's gold prices may open higher. The general situation of the past week is summarized below.</p>
<p>Complex Psychology and Volatile Market Conditions On Monday (December 7), the silver report increased again by 1875, the silver price increased by 2.5 shillings, the spread widened by two levels, and the internal market was also loose. Most market participants were hedging, causing the gold price to fall by 7.8 taels at the opening, to 693 taels. It then rose to 96 taels due to strong buying. This was because of the US proposal to discuss silver prices. It then fell to 87 taels, and then rose due to large buyers. The momentum was strong, and it rose to 98 taels. The noon close was 94 taels. The afternoon opened at 93.5 taels. Later, it fell from 95 taels to 87 taels. The closing price was 87.8 taels. The Bombay report showed a drop of four days compared to the previous Saturday, a total of 12.9 taels. The difference was ten taels throughout the day. On Tuesday, the silver report increased sharply by 1875, the silver price increased by one penny, and the shilling also rose by three levels. The internal market was strong for British hard currency and American flat currency, due to small exchange rate arbitrage. The gold price fell by 9.8 taels at the opening, to 670.8 taels. The market sold aggressively, falling to 77 taels. Afterwards, buying increased, resulting in a price of 87.5 taels. The noon close was 84 taels. In the morning, it was 81.2 taels. Later, due to buying by Wu and others, the price rose sharply, breaking through the 700 tael mark, to 700.5 taels. The closing price was 697.3 taels, due to long positions being sold off. It rose by 9.5 taels compared to the 10th, reversing the downward trend of four days. The day's range was 23.5 taels. On Wednesday, the silver report rebounded by 1875, and the silver market shrank by 375. The shilling initially remained unchanged, then shrank by one level. The internal market was also firm, and gold firms sold off. The gold price should have risen, but unexpectedly, there were complications. A large market participant from Guangdong was tied up, and speculators, fearing that the person would sell off long positions, sold off first, causing the market to open down by 3.8 taels, to 93.5 taels. It then fell from 95.5 taels to 88.5 taels, because Yuan, Yong, Guo, Re, Dai, Heng, Sheng, Da, and others sold 3,400 taels. Later, various parties and Hengxing repurchased. The shilling also shrank, suddenly turning upward, reaching 705.5 taels. The noon close was 700.05 taels. In the afternoon, it opened at 700 taels. Later, the Bombay report was down slightly, resulting in 704 taels. Suddenly, due to sales from Dalianbang and others, and news of a poor situation, it fell to 697.3 taels. The closing price was 701.5 taels. Bombay continued to fall, Hengxing bought again, and the price increased by 4.2 taels compared to the previous day. The day's range was 17 taels. On Thursday, the silver report shrank suddenly by 9375, a reversal of the upward trend of four days. The American silver only shrank by half, and the shilling shrank by one level, but the internal market was the opposite, resulting in an increase. Most Chinese merchants sold off. At the opening of the gold market, it only increased by 5 taels, to 706.5 taels, then to 7.5 taels to 8 taels. Later, due to reports that American congressmen were proposing to abandon the gold standard, large market participants sold off, causing a sharp drop of more than 10 taels. At noon, it was 90 taels. The closing price was 91 taels. The afternoon opened at 1.5 taels. Later, due to aggressive selling reported by Bombay, it was only 84.5 taels. The closing price was 85 taels, down 16.5 taels compared to the previous day, with a range of 23.5 taels. On Friday, the report turned up by 4375, the silver market by half, the shilling up by one level, and the internal market loose. Gold firms sold out. The gold market opened high at 89 taels due to the good base, and the US silver market increased. Next up was 90.5 taels. However, reports that the United States was reducing the fineness of gold coins and that the Japanese cabinet had resigned led to widespread panic, causing a steep drop of 30 taels, abruptly falling to 62 taels. The noon close was 66 taels. In the afternoon, at 62 taels, the Japanese cabinet had fallen, and the gold ban was expected to be implemented soon. In addition, Germany was buying silver to make marks, further increasing panic, causing a sudden drop to 49 taels. Later, there seemed to be a reversal of the trend, reaching 60 taels. The closing price was 56.8 taels, a total drop of 28.2 taels. The day's swing was 43.5 taels. On Saturday, the silver report increased by 25, the silver price by half, the shilling increased, the internal market tightened, and gold firms did not sell off. The gold market opened high at 65.5 taels due to good support, and the US sold out, increasing confidence. It then rose from 59 taels to 68 taels. The market conditions were uncertain, and it then fell to 57 taels. After 10:30, large market participants bought aggressively, jumping more than 13 taels, to 70.08 taels, and then falling back to 67.5 taels. The closing price was 69.5 taels, an increase of 12.7 taels compared to the previous day. The range for half a day was 13.8 taels. The high and low prices for British and American silver markets, exchange rates, and gold prices are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Reasons for Tight Silver Supply <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a key figure in the financial world stated that the reason for the tightening silver supply was that Japanese commercial firms were selling goods, but were afraid to come forward themselves, so they entrusted foreign banks to collect the money on their behalf, no less than 300,000 to 400,000 per day. If this continues, the Chinese's cash holdings will gradually decrease. If no measures are taken to prevent this, then there will be no cash left to adjust with.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Securities Last Week Bond Prices Fall Several Yuan <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Market is Very Chaotic and the Trend is Moderate</p>
<p>Over Two Thousand Transactions for More Than One Million Six Hundred Thousand</p>
<p>The bond transaction situation of the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange last week (from December 7th to 12th) showed that spot goods were relatively stable, and there were many kinds of activities opened every day. The total transaction for the whole week was 228,500 yuan, including 42,500 yuan for unified tax, 39,000 yuan for Sixth Year Consolidation Bonds, about 16,700 yuan each for 1920 Customs Bonds and Salt Tax Bonds of the 20th Year, 34,000 yuan for Troop Reduction Bonds, 30,000 yuan for Ninth Year Benevolent Bonds, and 5,000 yuan for Customs Bonds. However, there was very little activity for the Perpetual Bonds of the 96th Year. The market trading situation was dull and lifeless. Except for the first day of the week when the transaction reached more than 5.5 million yuan, the remaining days were only around 3 million yuan. The total transaction volume for six days was 21.16 million yuan, a decrease of 3 million yuan compared with the previous week. Only the December term was traded. Although the monthly auction was opened as usual, there were still no transactions. The internal calculations include 3.53 million for the 20th Year Customs Bonds, 3.465 million yuan for the Salt Tax, 3.295 million yuan for the Unified Tax, 2.575 million yuan for the Fifth Year Benevolent Bonds, 2.345 million yuan for the 19th Year Customs Bonds, 1.935 million yuan for the 20th Year Bonds, 1.83 million yuan for the Troop Reduction Bonds, 1.385 million yuan for the Troop Demobilization Bonds, 505,000 yuan for the Sixth Year Consolidation Bonds, 395,000 yuan for the Customs Bonds, and 280,000 yuan for the Fifth and Sixth Year Public Bonds. As for the changing situation, although there have been changes in the domestic and foreign situations, the situation is very chaotic and there has been no obvious development. The market is waiting and watching, and there are few people entering and leaving. The supply and demand situation is balanced. Bond prices only fluctuate with the temporary market situation. The trend is quite chaotic. The market sentiment was weak during the week, and demand decreased. Retail investors sold actively. Prices weakened due to oversupply, and various bonds fell by two yuan or less. On Tuesday, the situation improved, and sellers stopped selling, while buyers still had demand, so various prices rebounded slightly. On Wednesday and Thursday, the domestic and foreign situation changed drastically, and the bond market was dull, with very balanced supply and demand. The price trend was very sluggish, fluctuating very steadily every day. By the weekend, the situation turned worse. Our hope for the National Assembly to uphold justice has now revealed its weakness and is about to end hastily with no results. Although there are no new changes in the Sino-Japanese situation, observing the future, the nightmare is long and mostly filled with pessimistic elements. As a result, the general public's sentiment has become weak again, and many retail investors have sold, while demand is extremely cold, and investors are extremely rare. Prices have gradually declined. As a result, compared with the previous week, the Ninth Year Benevolent Bonds fell by as much as four yuan, and the Tenth Year Bonds for Customs, Unified Tax, and Salt Tax fell by about one and a half yuan. Other bonds also fell by a small number of cents to one yuan and fifty-six cents. The situation of the bond market is still difficult to be optimistic, and future changes are unpredictable. The high and low fluctuations of various bond prices are listed in the following table (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Actual Demand Also Stagnant</p>
<p>The yarn market fell sharply by 23 taels at the beginning of last week. Due to poor news, the Japanese army was harassing the Northeast severely, and the situation was becoming increasingly serious. Money was tight, and people were panicked. The market fell, and actual demand from customers also stagnated. The situation was unstable, finances were exhausted, and commerce could not develop. After some fluctuations, the price of standard yarn for the near month fell by 3 taels and 8 qian compared to the previous week, and the price for the far month fell by 1 tael and 1.2 qian. The highest and lowest prices of standard yarn for each month are listed in the table below for comparison:</p>

<p>Spot Goods Sources Scattered</p>
<p>The cotton market situation is very weak. Because American cotton is sluggish and gold prices are falling, people's morale is low. However, Indian cotton prices are rising due to poor harvests, which has made the market slightly tighter. Currently, the sources from various places are declining. Money is extremely tight, and fewer cotton merchants are going to the production areas to purchase goods. Therefore, there is no hope for a smooth supply. The market situation can only be stabilized. The price of standard cotton for the near month fell by 5 cents compared to the previous week, and the price for the far month rose by 1 qian to 1.5 qian. The highest and lowest prices of Hankou standard cotton for each month are listed in the table below for comparison:</p>

<p>Nantou Yesterday, the rice sources from various merchants were difficult to ship to the port due to the strong north wind. However, the supply was still abundant. City and rural stores had few customers due to the cold weather. The price of new indica rice was similar to the previous day. There was not much stock of early and late rice. The market in this street was still quiet. The price of foreign rice, Dujian, and Pujiang boat goods was about four yuan per barrel. The whole city increased by one corner because of the tightening supply.</p>
<p>Double Yin One Yuan, No Glory or Disgrace.</p>
<p>Xinzha The rice situation has not improved because the market in the interior is quiet, and there is still a lot of stock in this street. The river market is difficult to recover. There are not many people coming to the early market. The new top-grade goods in Changsu West are temporarily fixed. The middle and secondary grades are slightly moving, and the situation is sluggish. The price of early and late rice fell and then stabilized because buyers had to cut prices. Foreign Dujian rice sells the best, so the price is also tightening. The rise and fall of the port price are limited. Kunshan sales are sluggish, and the price is lower by a few cents.</p>

Only the imported goods arrived with more than 6,000 loads a day. There were more than 3,000 loads of galvanized iron, more than 1,000 loads of French four-nail nails, and 7800 loads each of triangular iron and new foreign yuan.

<p>Key Resolutions After the report and speeches, the following resolutions were made on the spot: (1) Oppose accepting humiliating and power-losing conditions, oppose the Jinzhou neutral zone, oppose joint management of Tianjin, and oppose the neutral country investigation team; (2) Recover lost territory and let the people automatically arm themselves and declare war on Japan; (3) Deny the League of Nations plan, deny Shi as the representative of China, and deny Foreign Minister Gu; (4) Thoroughly sever economic ties, thoroughly boycott Japanese goods, organize people's inspection teams for Japanese goods, and auction off confiscated Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Riot At 3:30 pm, the meeting was adjourned. Various groups attending the meeting paraded and demonstrated. Rioters also infiltrated the parade, distributing reactionary leaflets, shouting reactionary slogans, and taking the opportunity to disrupt public order. The riot first started from the meeting place, heading east on Fang Xie Road, walking to the east side of the municipal party headquarters on Linyi Road. A French-owned tram number 3 of route 6 was parked in the middle of the road. The rioters immediately smashed the glass and car doors. Continuing west, past Ximen, they also destroyed Hua Shang tram numbers 38 of route 4, 34 of route 3, 40, 17, 14, 43, 26, route 2 public buses, municipal government notice numbers 4556, route 3 numbers 7406, 4284, car numbers 575, 831, and even a horse-drawn carriage with a bride sitting inside.</p>
<p>Police Chief Kidnapped Police Chief Liu of the second district and second precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau was standing at the Ximen intersection. When the parade passed, he was forcibly kidnapped by rioters, who forced him to participate in the riot. Police Chief Liu was unable to resist and was taken to Penglai Road. He was then rescued by the Municipal Public Security Bureau's police corps patrol team. Later, a sledgehammer, left behind by the rioters, was found in the round-trip trailer number 14 of Hua Shang tram route 3.</p>
<p>Prior Precautions The Municipal Public Security Bureau received a report in advance, saying that when the People's National Salvation Association held a citizen assembly, rioters would infiltrate it, intending to disrupt public order. The bureau immediately ordered the various districts, precincts, sub-precincts, police stations, and team leaders to take strict precautions. The authorities in the Public Concession and the French Concession also received the same report and also stepped up precautions yesterday.</p>
<p>Temporary Martial Law Because the Municipal Public Security Bureau had taken precautions in advance, when the parade and demonstration began, the police corps patrol team was already patrolling fully armed. They immediately went to suppress the riot and were able to disperse the rioters after reaching Penglai Road. The rioters took the opportunity to flee north without a trace. Temporary martial law was declared that evening.</p>
<h3 id="e111">The Xinming Ship Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Carrying Overseas Chinese Returning Home <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>A Total of One Thousand Two Hundred and Twenty-Five People</p>
<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Arranged for Them to Reside in Various Guild Halls</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was ordered to send the Xinming Ship to Japan to carry overseas Chinese returning home. Yesterday morning, the ship arrived in Shanghai fully loaded with compatriots. The Social Affairs Bureau and various fellow associations went to take care of them and made arrangements for their accommodation. The details of each item are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Ship Arrived in Yokohama The Xinming Ship set sail on the 30th of last month to transport overseas Chinese to Japan. It arrived in Yokohama on the afternoon of the 5th. Chiang Tso-pin, the former Republic of China Minister to Japan, Ling Manshou, the Consul General in Yokohama, Zhou, the Consul General in Shincho, Bao Yingzhang, the Standing Committee Member of the Yokohama Branch directly under the Chinese Kuomintang, and Zhang Youfu, the representative of the Chinese Association, prepared various foods and welcomed the ship. On the evening of that day, they held a banquet at the Boyating Restaurant to welcome the ship's owner, Ma Jiajun, the first mate, Qian Yujia, and the acting business director, Wang Shanhai.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Both Places At Yokohama, 693 male overseas Chinese, 77 female overseas Chinese, and 121 children were loaded onto the ship for their return home. At noon on the 7th, the ship left Yokohama for Kobe. It arrived in Kobe at 8 am on the 9th. Chinese groups were also very welcome. At that time, 188 male overseas Chinese, 59 female overseas Chinese, and 87 children were loaded onto the ship. A total of 1,225 people and more than 2,000 pieces of luggage were loaded from both places. The most were from Wenzhou and Taizhou in Zhejiang, followed by Ningbo, Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangsu. At 4 pm on the 9th, the ship set sail from Kobe, traveled along the Inland Sea, passed through Moji, changed to the East China Sea, and returned home.</p>
<p>Encountered a Hurricane At around 10 pm on the 11th, the ship encountered a hurricane about 100 miles east of Hana Mountain. The Xinming Ship was quite dangerous in the wind and waves, and all the overseas Chinese were extremely panicked. The ship's owner, Ma Jiajun, tried to comfort the overseas Chinese. At the same time, in order to avoid danger, he drove slowly. All more than 100 staff members stayed up day and night. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 12 pm on the 12th, but therefore arrived at Wusong at 1:30 am yesterday. It was late at night, so it anchored and stayed. It sailed into the Wusongkou at 6 am at dawn and arrived in Shanghai at 8:45 am, berthing at Pier No. 4 of Jinliyuan in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Arrangements Made The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent staff to the pier to take care of the returnees. The French Concession authorities sent detectives to maintain order. The Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, Guangdong, and Jiangsu Shanghai Fellow Associations, the Fujian Sanshan Guild Hall, and the Japanese Students' General Association sent staff to receive the returnees. The Social Affairs Bureau, together with various fellow associations, temporarily arranged for accommodation and issued food allowances in order to arrange for them to be sent back to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Situation in Japan A reporter from Xin Sheng She visited Wang Shanhai, the business director of the ship, yesterday. According to him, all procedures for this trip to Japan were completed by the commissioner Guo Waifeng, who telegraphed the consul in Japan. Therefore, when arriving in Yokohama, inspections such as quarantine were waived. The round trip took more than ten days and consumed more than 300 tons of coal and more than 50 piculs of rice. The Japanese were surprised to see that the Xinming Ship was managed entirely by Chinese people and showed their admiration. It is now scheduled to set sail as usual on the 15th to Weihai, Yantai, and Tianjin to load passengers. Commissioner Guo has already telegraphed the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to report the progress.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Letter to the Nation from the University Students Anti-Japanese Joint Association <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai University Students Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association's letter to the nation regarding the "January 29th Incident" reads:</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of Japanese aggression, the government has passively watched our great rivers and mountains shrink by a hundred miles each day, with countless compatriots being brutally massacred. Other than (calmness), there is nothing else to comfort the people of the nation. Students in Shanghai, unwilling to see the descendants of the Yellow Emperor perish in this way, acting on the principle of "Everyone is responsible for the fate of the nation," and standing on the position of the national revolutionary movement, organized the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association to awaken the people, rise together to seek survival, and train ourselves to prepare for national crisis. Furthermore, with diplomacy repeatedly failing and the situation becoming increasingly urgent, we twice went to Beijing to request that the government vigorously implement revolutionary diplomacy and resolutely send troops to resist the invaders. Our loyal and sincere heart and passionate spirit should be understood and appreciated by all compatriots. However, the Shanghai Special City Party Committee members, who have always regarded themselves as leaders of the people, at this critical moment of national crisis, should have恪遵 [respectfully followed] Sun Yat-sen's instructions to "not slacken day and night" and be the "vanguard for the people." Instead, they superficially guided and participated in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement of our association, but in reality, they interfered in every way possible, and their secret sabotage efforts were relentless. For example, during our association's second petition in Beijing, Education Director Zhang, representing Chairman Chiang, replied that he had not prevented students from coming to Beijing. However, the City Party Committee issued urgent instructions beforehand to strictly prevent and suppress. Unable to prevent it, they then made false accusations to the chief of the Executive Yuan, who openly affirmed that the petitioning group was deliberately causing trouble. Although they later declared it untrue, the students had no choice but to leave Beijing with tears in their eyes. As another example, when our association recently telegraphed Chairman Chiang, inquiring about the truth of the arrest of Peking University students and the humiliating diplomacy, the City Party Committee members instructed their lackeys to use economic blockade policies to delay the dispatch of the telegram for two days. These are the most obvious examples. However, our association believes that the urgent task at hand is to resist foreign aggression, and we have no time to question the motives of the City Party Committee's actions. We still endure humiliation and strive to do our best to understand. Unexpectedly, on the 9th of this month, when our association's 21st Delegates' Conference was held at the Youth Propaganda Corps, dozens of plainclothes detectives actually followed Committee Member Tao Baichuan of the City Party Committee into the venue. After the discussion of the third petition to Beijing was completed, Peking University representative Mr. Xu reported on the various oppressions suffered by Peking</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>University students in Beijing and the news of their being tied up and escorted back to Peiping. When Central University representative Mr. Jiang reported the recent truth of the diplomatic situation, the plainclothes detectives shouted "Beat them!" Our association immediately implored Committee Member Tao to take responsibility for maintaining order, but Committee Member Tao ignored it. Our association, knowing that the environment was bad and that the members' freedom of speech was no longer safe, decided on the spot to "immediately change the venue," and the next day's delegates' conference was held at Jiaotong University. However, we still did not expect that the City Party Committee authorities, in broad daylight, would take extremely despicable and vicious measures to deal with the pure youths engaged in anti-Japanese national salvation. As soon as the meeting ended, Mr. Xu and Mr. Jiang stepped out, and the plainclothes detectives swarmed downstairs, colluding with the hooligans who had been lying in wait outside the door, kidnapped Mr. Xu, put him in a car, and sped away. Mr. Jiang was brutally beaten and covered in wounds. Thanks to the rescue of all the representatives of our association, he was spared. At the time, there were many assailants, and they were armed. Our association was unable to arrest all of them, but only captured Wang Fusheng and handed him over to the police station for custody. After the incident, the entire association was extremely indignant and immediately went to the Public Security Bureau to question why they had not provided protection beforehand and why they had not helped to arrest the perpetrators afterward. At that time, Director Chen Xizeng replied, "The City Party Committee notified the Student Federation to send police for protection at each meeting in the past. This time, we did not receive a notification, so it was not convenient to send police. If the Public Security Bureau personnel were negligent afterward, they will be punished according to the law," etc. Our association pondered this repeatedly and firmly believed that the instigator of this unfortunate incident must be the Shanghai Special City Party Committee. The various reasons are listed as follows: (1) The City Party Committee must notify the police to protect the meeting in the past. Why was this time an exception? (2) Committee Member Tao Baichuan of the City Party Committee must wait for the meeting to end before leaving in the past. Why did he leave beforehand this time? (3) When plainclothes detectives disrupted the meeting, our association asked Committee Member Tao to stop them. Why did he ignore it? (4) Why did Committee Member Tao publicly slander the second petition at our association's meeting? (5) Our association has repeatedly decided that non-school representatives may not attend, but Committee Member Tao deliberately disrupted this proposal first, causing our association to be unable to implement this resolution and drive the plainclothes detectives out of the venue (although the venue of the Youth Propaganda Corps is for everyone to speak, since a group has borrowed it, it should be able to prevent bystanders from listening). (6) There are several Party Committee cadres among the perpetrators. (7) The perpetrators rested in the Public Security Bureau. (8) Why did City Party Committee officials pose as student representatives to participate in the disruption? Based on the above reasons, the responsibility for the incident is known to everyone. Our association deeply grieves the trampling of the young students and the escalating sabotage of the patriotic movement. Therefore, that night, we sent 5,000 students to inquire about the reasons from the City Party Committee, but to no avail. We also asked the Municipal Government for the following four conditions: (1) Do not suppress the anti-Japanese movement. (2) Release the arrested students. (3) Punish the Director of the Public Security Bureau. (4) Punish the City Party Committee personnel. Mayor Zhang then ordered the suspension of Public Security Bureau Director Chen Xizeng for investigation and ordered the arrest of Tao Baichuan for trial. All the students then straightened their ranks and stood all night in the Municipal Government Square, waiting for the release of the arrested students. On the morning of the 10th, upon Mayor Zhang's instruction, our association sent five representatives, together with Municipal Government representatives Sun Baorong and Guo Rui, to organize a temporary court and extract the perpetrator Wang Fusheng from the court for interrogation. Knowing that the evidence was conclusive and undeniable, the perpetrator voluntarily confessed the truth, saying, "I am a party member and was ordered by Xie, Gu, and other party members to suppress the patriotic movement." At 10:00 a.m., Peking University arrested student Mr. Xu was found by Secretary-General Yu and brought to the Municipal Government, where he immediately reported the process of his arrest to the public, saying, "The Public Security Bureau, on the order of the City Party Committee, kidnapped me and escorted me to Pudong and Dongjiadu Wharf, etc., Jiangxin." Then Mayor Zhang came out and addressed the entire association, saying, "I myself have never suppressed the patriotic movement. This incident was entirely caused by Public Security Bureau Director Chen Xizeng deliberately deceiving and being exploited by others. It is truly heartbreaking." His attitude was extremely sincere at the time, and the students were very moved. They then immediately asked the mayor to set a deadline for arresting Chen and Tao. The mayor replied, "I am responsible for arresting Chen and Tao within three days and handing them over to the temporary court for interrogation." All the students believed that the reply was satisfactory, shouted slogans, and returned to school in formation. This is the general situation of the "January 29th Incident." After this, our association believed even more that the Shanghai City Party Committee and the Public Security Bureau should bear full responsibility for this unfortunate incident. The reasons are further stated on the left: (1) When some students petitioned the City Party Committee, why did Committee Member Tao Baichuan refuse to meet and escape through the back door? If he was not afraid of guilt and vanity, how could he do this? (2) "Party members have no personal freedom." The perpetrator Wang Fusheng confessed that he and other accomplices were all party members. It is clear that they were instructed by the Party Committee. If the Party Committee believes that Wang's and others' acts of violence were individual actions, why has it not enforced strict party discipline and severely punished them since the incident? (3) According to the report of Peking University representative Mr. Xu and the speech of Mayor Zhang, there is no doubt that the City Party Committee instructed the Public Security Bureau to commit the crime. Alas, the facts are now as clear as fire. If the Kuomintang still has party discipline and the National Government still has laws, it will arrest and interrogate Chen, Tao, and other moths who sabotage the national salvation movement in the shortest possible time and execute them according to the law. Our association takes anti-Japanese national salvation as its banner. If the running dogs of the Japanese invaders are not eliminated for a day, our association's responsibility will not be fulfilled for a day. In the future, no matter how Tao, Chen, etc., spread rumors and slander, and retaliate to their heart's content, our association will lead all Shanghai students to fight them to the death and will never evade. Tao, Chen, etc., are corrupt and incompetent and have been doing evil for many years. Their tricks are only up to this point. We hope that all compatriots will see through their treachery, rise up together to denounce them, pacify the interior and resist the foreigners, and carry out both in parallel. The future of the nation and its substantial benefits depend on this. This is our declaration.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Emergency Congress of All City Party Members <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Unanimously Resolved to Reorganize the City Party Committee and Take Over Immediately</p>
<p>Establishment of the Party Affairs Improvement Committee and Election of 17 Committee Members</p>
<p>All Shanghai city party members held an emergency congress at 9:00 a.m. on December 13th at the Franco-Chinese University on Jin Shenfu Road. A total of more than 2,300 party members attended. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Congress Staff: At 9:00 a.m., all city party members had gathered in the Franco-Chinese University gymnasium and announced the opening of the meeting. Wang Hanliang, Zhang Juansheng, and Chen Xuanren were publicly elected as the presidium, Peng Xuewen was the master of ceremonies, and Xing Wan was the recorder. Then they stood up and sang the party song and performed the rituals. Chairman's Report: Since the outbreak of Japanese aggression in the three northeastern provinces, the diplomatic situation has become increasingly dangerous. Revolutionary comrades in this city have used various methods in the past to continuously fight against feudal forces. However, due to the excessive oppression of the City Party Committee, revolutionary comrades have been displaced and displaced, so that the revolutionary spirit cannot be concretely expressed. This is what we are extremely pained by. In recent years, the party affairs of Shanghai Special City can be said to be completely controlled by a few people. All actions of the City Party Committee are not only completely isolated from the people, but even isolated from the party members. Recently, the City Party Committee has openly dared to do things that are not right, using the most despicable kidnapping methods to destroy the patriotic movement, causing all city party members to indirectly and invisibly suffer great humiliation. This is even more what we cannot tolerate. The purpose of our meeting today is, on the one hand, to recognize that the actions of the City Party Committee (completely stand on the counter-revolutionary position, and they have discarded the party discipline, the teachings of the Premier, and the will of all city party members. On the other hand, the current City Party Committee has been disgusted and denied by all the people of the city. We want to establish a revolutionary and democratic City Party Committee to replace the corrupt and deteriorating City Party Committee. From today onwards, we will enthusiastically and bravely follow the teachings of the Premier to open up a new path and move forward towards the revolutionary and bright goal.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Echoes of Wang Jingwei's Telegram <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Declaration of the Inner Mongolia People's United Association: The Inner Mongolia People's United Association's declaration for Mr. Wang Jingwei's telegram to the newspapers is as follows: The Japanese have been operating in the Northeast for decades. They have actively monopolized minerals and railways, and competitively found markets and raw materials. However, our country's authorities are brave in civil wars and cowardly in resisting foreign aggression. When the eastern provinces fell, most of Inner Mongolia also perished. Those who hold military power looked out for themselves, avoided, and used the wonderful metaphor of not resisting. The government pretended to be calm and prayed to the League of Nations. Justice was not served, and people were panicking. The people of the whole country were filled with righteous indignation, lamenting that the eastern land was changing color and would become a continuation of Korea. The old tombs of Gan City had almost no place to be mourned. The Inner Mongolia people first had the organization of the self-defense army, followed by the initiative of the volunteer army. Unfortunately, there was no guiding agency, and it was difficult to promote the patriotic spirit. Recently, the government has also suppressed the patriotic movement of the people. Hearing this, I am deeply grieved and pained. Just when I was overwhelmed, I read Mr. Wang Jingwei's telegram advocating the organization of a national salvation conference to jointly deal with the national crisis. Now that the national affairs are in danger and diplomacy is urgent, the public's opinions cannot reach the government. The government's rejection of public opinion will inevitably lead to a situation where the people and the government do not cooperate. To save this crisis, there is no second way but Mr. Wang's proposal. With Mr. Wang's decades of glorious revolutionary history, speeches, and proposals, the people are all in agreement. In recent years, he has established a democratic political system and struggled hard, and he is truly the nanny of the people and the pillar of the party and the country. For the sake of national salvation, our Inner Mongolia people must share the same hatred and extremely support and carry out the end from the beginning. The Inner Mongolia people are good at riding and shooting, and those who grow up in the Northeast are even more numerous. In the icy and snowy land, there is no need to worry about frostbite. Flying horses and sharp blades can easily frustrate the ferocity of strong enemies. From the five million people, select tens of thousands of strong men, organize a volunteer army, and receive the command of the National Salvation Conference. Defending the soil and guarding the homeland is a win-win situation. It can also encourage the people's morale. The mournful horn of the warhorse is enough to await the urgent order. In the autumn of the country's survival, although the association's power is weak, it will do its best to promote saving the country from danger to the people and is not without small help. I respectfully offer this declaration.</p>
<p>Political Training Class Telegram: All compatriots of the nation, you are aware that our colleagues of the association are deeply concerned about the state of the nation and the decline of the people's livelihood. Internal political disputes and diplomatic pressure make us fear the sinking of the Divine Land, but we do not know where to die. Recently, after reading Mr. Wang's telegram initiating the National Salvation Conference, we could not help but cheer. Since the Northern Expedition, our party has painfully harmed the people, suffered the oppression of new and old warlords, and been trampled by the communist bandits. We have fallen into a state of eternal damnation and have no chance to strive on our own. Fortunately, Mr. Wang, our revolutionary leader, has promoted democratic politics and has gained the faith of the people of the country. However, it has not been realized until now. The initiation of this National Salvation Conference is a great opportunity for our people to participate in politics and resolve national affairs. We hope that we will all rise up together to participate in the organization, so that it can be realized in the shortest possible time. Restore our rivers and mountains and save the crisis together.

<p>The Shanghai County winter grain tax collection office opened on the 5th of this month. Subsequently, the bureau found that the amount of busy silver in the 20th year and the old arrears of last year's busy grain tax were still huge. Now, it has received a telegram from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance stating that the provincial treasury is empty, and the administrative expenses of various agencies are without funds. In addition to borrowing winter grain tax from Wuxi and other counties, all provincial tax arrears in the county must be strictly urged to be paid to the treasury by the deadline. Therefore, Director Wang of the bureau yesterday specifically ordered the urging officials to inform the township chiefs to urge and collect all old arrears from the busy grain tax collection period as soon as possible and pay them in full. If there are stubborn households who deliberately delay payment, they will be reported and prosecuted to emphasize the national tax.</p>

<p>The Southern Fujian Shanghai Fellow Association telegraphed the Fujian Aviation National Salvation Association yesterday, saying, "In today's country, no force is insufficient to defend itself. Force is not just about fighting. At first, it relied on bows, arrows, knives, and stones for assistance. Then, it relied on guns, cannons, and warships for strength. Now, it emphasizes air combat and values airplanes. The rise and fall of force depends on the strength of the air force. General Ma Zhanshan has repeatedly defeated Japanese bandits, but the reason why he has not been able to win consistently is that the lack of airplanes is his weakest point. Our Fujian has many mountains and urgently needs airplanes. Internally, it can be used to govern bandits, and externally, it can be used to resist Japan. The strategy of national salvation is the most urgent task. Your association advocates aviation, and our association expresses its deep admiration. We hope that you will provide detailed information on the measures so that we can strive to carry them out." The Southern Fujian Shanghai Fellow Association, Yuan.</p>

The remaining amount will be determined based on the number of outstanding entries. The association has already secured sufficient funds for a year's worth of prizes. The first essay contest topics, related to economics, have been drafted by Dr. Zhang Sumin and others. They are listed below:</p>
<p>(First Question) Modern, commonly accepted economics is mostly based on the theories of the neoclassical school, with slight modifications. However, there has been considerable criticism in recent times, with some even creating a new institutionalist school. What are the origins of this so-called commonly accepted economics? What is its theoretical system? What are its research methods and objects of study? What are the points of attack made by critics? What is the basis of their arguments? What does the institutionalist school emphasize? What methods do they employ? To what extent has it developed today? Please elaborate on this.</p>
<p>(Second Question) The rickshaw puller is a difficult problem in our country's labor issues. Conduct personal interviews with fifty to one hundred rickshaw pullers or their family members in your city. Accurately investigate the following items, as well as any other items you deem necessary, and list them in a table for detailed discussion.

<p>(Third Question) An economic severance with Japan is widely considered an essential measure for national salvation. Within this economic severance, boycotting Japanese goods is of utmost importance. Which Japanese goods can be replaced with domestic products? Which can only be temporarily replaced with goods from other countries? How do their uses and prices compare to Japanese goods? How can consumers be protected from losses and permanently maintain the boycott? Furthermore, for imitation foreign goods that use Japanese raw materials, what alternative sources of raw materials can be used? How do their uses and prices compare to Japanese goods? Can they be self-sufficient and self-manufactured? What are the costs of self-manufacture? Please conduct a detailed investigation of the categories, sales volume, value, function, and comparison with substitutes, as well as the costs of self-manufacture, and present them in two separate tables: A, Commodities; B, Raw materials for imitation foreign goods.

<h3 id="e127">A Bathhouse Customer Commits Suicide by Poison <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>First Deceived by a Friend</p>
<p>Then Deceived by a Military Officer</p>
<p>Two Suicide Attempts, But Both Times Survives</p>
<p>A Strange and Laughable Suicide Note</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 7 PM, a bathhouse named He Qingchi, located at number 58 Datong Road, Zhabei, was visited by a customer who appeared to be around twenty years old and was wearing very thin clothing. After bathing, he lay down on a couch and remained there for a long time without moving. A staff member, suspecting something was wrong, approached him and noticed a strange color in his face, fearing that he had taken poison. He immediately reported this to the bathhouse owner, Feng Guozhen, who then summoned police officers from post number seven. The officers transported the bathhouse customer to Pushan Hospital, where doctors determined that he had ingested opium. They immediately administered emergency treatment, reviving him and enabling him to speak. He was then transferred to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau for questioning. According to his own account, his surname was Li, his given name was Jinming, and he was 24 years old. He was originally from Anhui and currently resided at number 2, Shipai Lane, outside of Changmen, Suzhou. He had previously served as the director of the Wujiang Detention Center but was dismissed after a disagreement with his superiors. He returned to his hometown, and last month managed to scrape together several dozen yuan for travel expenses, packed a bag of belongings, and came to Shanghai to seek employment. A friend named Wang Xingming, whom he had met in Suzhou, accompanied him and resided with him at a certain hotel near the North Station. However, Wang suddenly had malicious intentions and lured him to an amusement park for entertainment, while at the same time secretly stealing his luggage and silver dollars without a trace. At this point, he had lost both his possessions and his wealth and felt extremely discouraged. However, he still did not want to return to his hometown immediately, to avoid being laughed at. Therefore, the next day he went to a certain school in Brahma Ferry to visit a friend, making a final appeal. Because the address was unclear, he was unable to find the school and returned disappointed. Alone, he walked forward, encountering a small river. He then resolved to commit suicide by jumping into the river, seeking death. However, death did not come, and instead, he encountered a philanthropist named Mr. Wang, who gave him five yuan and urged him to return home and not take his life lightly. He returned to the North Station, abandoning the path to death and instead seeking to join the military. He encountered someone dressed as a military officer, who told him that if he wanted to join the army, he must first get equipped. The five yuan in his pocket was then handed over to the military officer, who led him to the entrance of the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road and told him to wait a moment. The military officer then went inside to purchase military supplies but never returned. At this point, he knew he had been deceived again. With no way forward or backward, he had no choice but to pawn his close-fitting undershirt and pants for six dimes, finding temporary lodging at a small hotel for one night. With the remaining money, he purchased opium and went to the bathhouse to commit suicide, he said. A suicide note was found in Li's pocket, along with slips of paper containing anti-Japanese slogans and national salvation strategies. The handwriting in the suicide note was extremely潦草(liaocao - sloppy/cursive), and the writing was incoherent. The main idea was divided into three sections. The first section described how he had been lured and deceived by a treacherous friend, leading him to seek death. The second section stated that his family should not send anyone to Shanghai to handle his affairs after his death. The final section called out to his beloved mother, repeatedly, and stated that after his death, he would forever protect his mother's health. The letter ended there, but the signature at the end was surprisingly unexpected. After the three characters for "short-lived male," the English signature style, a transliteration of "Li Jinming," was appended. The date at the end of the letter, "12.12.4" in Arabic numerals, complemented the English signature, creating a unique style in a suicide note. The other two papers contained anti-Japanese slogans and popular writings of a national salvation nature, which were unremarkable compared to his vivid description of his suicide attempt.</p>

<p>Li Wu Dies From Excessive Poisoning</p>
<p>Li Guitang, 37 years old, from Shaoxing, and his wife, Wu, 27 years old, along with their son Jinxiang, 7 years old, and a newborn daughter just over two months old, totaling five family members, lived at 48 Xinzha Road near the Gordon Road intersection in Shanghai. Last night, after dinner, because the weather was severely cold, they moved the coal briquette stove into the room to keep warm. Shortly afterward, the doors were closed tightly, and the whole family went to sleep peacefully. However, the coal gas permeated the small room, and after prolonged exposure, they all suffered from coal poisoning and lost consciousness. Around 10 PM, a friend surnamed Ma arrived and knocked on the door several times but received no response. However, he saw coal gas flowing out from the cracks in the door. Initially suspecting a fire, he managed to pry open the door and entered the room, finding the entire family unconscious. Knowing that it was likely coal poisoning, he summoned neighbors to hire a car and transport them to Baolong Hospital for treatment. After examination, the others were found to be unharmed, but Wu, due to excessive poisoning, could not be saved and died half an hour later.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Preparation for the County National Goods Exhibition <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County People's Education Center sent a letter yesterday to the National Goods Factory Federation, stating that the brutal Japanese invasion is deeply hated by the people. In addition to armed resistance, economic severance is also a sound strategy for saving the country. At a time when the call to use domestic goods is reaching the heavens, our domestic goods industry should strive to manufacture goods to meet the demand. However, the public's ability to distinguish between domestic goods and foreign goods is weak, and unscrupulous merchants may inevitably mix the bad with the good. To enhance the public's knowledge and increase their patriotism, the center has decided to hold the first Shanghai County National Goods Exhibition for one week, starting on New Year's Day of the 21st year. After the exhibition closes, the exhibits will be preserved to create a display room for regular rotating exhibitions to promote the use of domestic goods. Our resources are limited, and collection is difficult. We request your federation's strong assistance to ensure its success.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Tobacco and Exchange Industry Continues to Request Exemption from Business Tax <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association has submitted another petition to the Municipal Government, stating that they respectfully follow the Ministry's approval, and, in accordance with the regulations of your government, the tobacco and exchange industry should be exempted from business tax. They are again submitting a request for review and approval, and to be ordered to comply. The association received a document from the Ministry of Finance, number 14174, stating that a petition had been submitted requesting that the tobacco and exchange industry be exempted from business tax. The Municipal Finance Bureau rejected this petition, and a special request was made for interpretation and exemption. After an investigation, it was found that after the promulgation of the business tax law, the central government collected tobacco and alcohol sales taxes, reserving one-tenth for the central government and allocating the rest to the provinces and cities as local revenue. The measures for the exemption of business taxes on the tobacco and alcohol industries have been newly revised. All shops that primarily engage in the sale of cigarettes or alcohol and also sell other goods, where the main business has already paid tobacco and alcohol license taxes, should have their business tax excluded and exempted. As for other part-time businesses, business tax should be levied in accordance with the established case. It was requested that the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau be ordered to comply, and that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce be notified. In response to this document, the association investigated the businesses of its members, finding that tobacco is the main part of their business, with other part-time goods accounting for approximately 20-30% on average. The annual business income is less than ten yuan. Now that the Ministry has approved a new revision, excluding and exempting the main part, it is consistent with the regulations of Article 3, paragraph 2 of your government's published tax ordinance (any business with an annual business income of less than one thousand yuan is exempted from business tax), and Article 8 (the business should be based on its main part to determine the business), the main part of the tobacco and exchange industry is tobacco, which has already been excluded and exempted, so the exemption of business tax for other part-time goods is undoubtedly based on the aforementioned two articles. Moreover, Shanghai is a special area, and its situation is different from the interior, so it cannot be compared. In recent years, commerce has declined, and making a living has become difficult. If more burdens are added, how can they maintain their livelihoods? It is hoped that your government will consider the difficulties of businesses and not reject the repeated requests of the association. The association, representing all members and businesses, humbly submits another request for review and approval. It is hoped that your government will order the Finance Bureau to exempt the tobacco and exchange industry from business tax, and all business owners will be extremely grateful and await your orders. This is a urgent appeal, awaiting your instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Wang Yansong's Resignation Speech <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yansong, a supervisory committee member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, recently submitted his resignation as a committee member of the Municipal Party Headquarters. He made a statement to the press, saying that he had been promoting party principles in his spare time from business, but he was ashamed of his lack of knowledge and unable to help with the current difficulties. He had repeatedly requested to resign from his position in the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, but due to the supervision of the Central Committee, the retention of comrades, and the urging of business colleagues to express the pain of industry and commerce and to plan for labor-management coordination, he had reluctantly done his best. However, the trend of the times is increasingly chaotic, and his talent is insufficient for the heavy responsibility, making him fear failure. Fortunately, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters executive and supervisory committee members have already submitted a request for collective resignation to the Central Committee. He, Wang Yansong, is happy to fulfill his initial wish, take a short rest, and devote himself to industrial and commercial endeavors and the development of the national economy, hoping to make a small contribution to strengthening national power. He deeply hopes that all comrades in the city and colleagues in the business community will acknowledge his sincerity, provide supervision, and be infinitely grateful.</p>

<p>Inside and Outside Cotton Mills: The Inside and Outside Cotton Mills Number One and Number Two on Robison Road in Western Shanghai have thousands of workers. Yesterday was Sunday, and no one was at the factory. Unexpectedly, at 8 PM, the four-story building suddenly caught fire. The chief of the Sixth District Police Station, seeing the situation, immediately ran to inform Inspector Gu, who reported to the Sixth District Headquarters. Chief Ren personally arrived with the police brigade and patrol team to investigate. However, the fire had already spread and was out of control. Fire trucks from Putuo Road, Jing'an Temple, and the Old Gate, along with Chinese and Western detectives from the Public Security Bureau, worked hard to extinguish the fire, which burned for two hours, causing traffic on Route 16 trolleybuses to be interrupted. Eleven foreign-style houses were burned down, and it is said that the losses were very heavy.</p>
<p>Robison Road: Furthermore, the newly built Shikumen houses behind the branch of the Grand Self-Sounding Clock Salt Industry Bank on Robison Road in Western Shanghai, which had not yet been completed, unexpectedly caught fire last night at 10 PM, spreading to the residences of neighbors surnamed Wang and Wu. Everyone was already asleep at the time, and when they awoke, it was too late to escape, so they had to jump out of the windows. As a result, a man surnamed Wu was seriously injured. The police transported him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. Three houses were destroyed in the fire.</p>
<p>East of the Sun Temple: The straw shed without a number east of the Sun Temple in Zhabei, where tenant Liu Dacha lived, suddenly caught fire last night at 11 PM for unknown reasons. The weather was cold and windy, and there was no running water nearby, making it difficult for the fire trucks to extinguish the fire. As a result, the fire was very fierce, spreading to more than fifty straw sheds. The fire was finally extinguished at 1 AM this morning. The suspected arsonist, Liu Dacha, has been arrested by the police and is being interrogated.</p>

<p>(1) The weather has suddenly become very cold in recent days. Around 9 PM the night before last, an unidentified elderly man, about 50 years old, collapsed near the intersection of Route Massenet and Route Tenant de Tour in the French Concession (east of the Second Special District Prison) due to the cold and inability to walk. French police officers found him, already frozen to the point of being barely alive, and took him to the police station, placing him in the water-heating boiler room to warm him. However, due to old age and weakness, the warming was ineffective, and he died at 10:30 PM. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue, but no relatives were found. The court will be requested today to send someone to examine the body. (2) Yesterday morning around 2 AM, a person froze to death at the eastern entrance of Beiwangyimalong, Houjia Road, Nanshi. He was about 50 years old, wearing a dark-colored padded jacket and trousers, a blue cloth apron around his waist, black socks, and black shoes. (3) Around 3 AM, another person, about 20 years old, was found dead near the western entrance of Nanwangyimalong, wearing a dark-colored short jacket, blue striped cloth trousers, black socks, and no shoes. He had also frozen to death. The responsible section of the Second District heard the news and immediately ordered the landlord to report to the court for examination.</p>

<p>Zhengzhou Ship Crashes Into Wharf Ship</p>
<p>A Ship Sinks to the Bottom with Cargo</p>
<p>Around 2:30 PM the day before yesterday, the Chinese merchant ship Zhengzhou, arriving in Shanghai from abroad, sailed to the outside of the Yitaixing warehouse wharf in Lijiadu, Pudong. At that time, it was a rising tide, and the north wind was unusually strong. The water was aided by the wind, and its force was even greater. The Zhengzhou ship sailed with the tide, causing the rudder to fail. The ship could not control itself and crashed into the Yitaixing wharf. Six or seven coal wharf ships were parked outside the wharf, and they were damaged in succession by the Zhengzhou ship. The damaged parts varied. Among them, two wharf ships hired by the Tianzhang Paper Mill, each carrying 50 tons of coal, suffered severe damage. Water immediately flooded the ships, and the entire ships and cargo sank to the bottom. Other ships belonging to Pu'an Public Security and Wanglinji, some loaded with coal and some empty, suffered varying degrees of damage. Yesterday, the affected parties requested the water police to investigate.</p>

<p>The three south-facing old bungalows at number 651 on the south end of Route Belleser (Rue du Père-Labbé), French Concession, owned by Zhang, were in disrepair and leaning precariously. It was planned to demolish them and build new houses. The old wooden materials were sold to Jiang Dekun, a native of Tongzhou, for a price of 120 yuan. He obtained a demolition permit from the Municipal Council, but it had not yet been issued. However, as the house was leaning precariously, Jiang hired workers on the morning of the 11th to start demolition. Unexpectedly, the demolition agitated the roof frame and bricks, which suddenly collapsed at 11 AM. Jiang and worker Xu Yizhi were cooking in the house and were crushed. Pedestrian Zhao Zhengye was also hit and injured on the head. The police transported them to the Guangci Hospital. Jiang, due to his old age and severe injuries, died the next morning despite medical treatment. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue. It was discovered that the deceased was 59 years old and lived in Zhao's residence in Nanhua Jie, Panjia Muqiaobang, and was a scrap metal dealer. His relatives were notified, and the court will be requested to examine the body today.</p>

Wu, a prosecutor from the Shanghai District Court, arrived at the scene to investigate and confirmed the cause of death. The local police were instructed to arrange for the body to be collected and placed in a coffin. However, Shen's wife, Shen Chen, stated that after the examination, the prosecutor had made no indication of any action. Neither the murderer has been punished, nor has anyone come forward with compensation. Therefore, although she has prepared a coffin, she has been weeping beside the coffin for the past two days, refusing to remove it. As of last night, it was still in the middle of the road.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Collection Agent Embezzles Over Twelve Thousand Gold <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Wu Qinghe, from Changzhou, was a collection agent for the Tianzhang Paper Mill at 6 Sichuan Road. Recently, the manager of the mill, Luo Changkai, discovered that Wu had privately collected over two thousand yuan in payments, so he reported it to the General Police Station, ordering Detective Feikelun to arrest Wu and escort him to the First Special Court for investigation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Jiashi continued the hearing in the criminal court. The lawyer for the police station, Ru Baoyi, stated that the plaintiff in this case initially only discovered that the defendant had embezzled over two thousand yuan. However, after the plaintiff carefully reviewed the accounts, it was discovered that Wu Qinghe had actually embezzled over twelve thousand yuan, for which detailed accounts were available. He requested that the court review the accounts and submitted them as evidence. Luo Changkai then submitted a report and questioned Wu Qinghe, who admitted that he had privately used all the amounts listed on the accounts presented by the plaintiff. Judge Xu reviewed the evidence and announced the judgment in court: Wu Qinghe was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for embezzling assets under his management in the course of his duties. The number of days spent in custody before the judgment is confirmed will be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for every one day of imprisonment.</p>

As the woman bent down to pick up the water bottle, the tram started to move, and the driver did not realize that someone was under the trailer. People shouted loudly, and the tram immediately stopped to check, but the woman had already been crushed in the lower body. She was immediately rescued, but her breath was faint. She was sent to the Xin Puyu Hall for treatment but died in the hospital.

<p>Zhang Qingxiang, the son of the late Zhang Linsen of Huayuanshi Bridge, Pudong, conspired with his maternal uncle, Zhang Quansheng, to seize the inheritance. They shot and injured his elder brother, Zhang Guoxiang, and killed his second brother, Zhang Yuxiang. The local court detained the defendants. Unexpectedly, Zhang Quansheng presented a false alibi, claiming that when Zhang Yuxiang was killed, he was at home drinking with Lu Liansheng, Yan Zilin, and Yan Xinglin. After Prosecutor Shen summoned and questioned them separately, their descriptions of the liquor differed. Some said it was sorghum wine, others said Wu Jiapi liquor, others said Shaoxing wine, and others said green bean liquor, creating a contradictory picture of red, green, yellow, and white. Regarding the side dishes, some said it was pork knuckle, others said chunks of meat, others said meatballs, and others said shredded meat, with inconsistencies in size. The interrogating officer determined that the evidence was false, and Zhang Quansheng was remanded in custody and denied visitors to prevent collusion.</p>

<p>Forced into Prostitution by Fellow Villager</p>
<p>Wang, the wife of Xie Xianlin from Ningbo, is a beautiful young woman. On the 11th of last month, the Xie couple had a quarrel over a trivial matter. In a fit of anger, Wang left her husband and intended to take a train to Shanghai. Upon arriving at the station, she met Zhang Xianghua, a woman from the same village. Zhang asked Wang why she wanted to go to Shanghai, and Wang explained the situation. Zhang offered to accompany her to Shanghai and help her find work. Wang believed her and went to Shanghai with her, residing at a certain address in Qinghefang, Hubei Road. Zhang had several fashionable dresses made for Wang and then forced her into prostitution. Wang, unfamiliar with the area and unable to seek help, deeply regretted leaving her husband and being deceived by a wicked person. However, it was too late. Reluctantly, she agreed to Zhang's request and went to various hotels every night to engage in prostitution. All the money she earned was given to Zhang. After his wife disappeared, Xie Xianlin asked his Shanghai friends, Wang Zhixiao and Dai Renzhi, to help him find her. After being entrusted, Wang and Dai searched diligently and recently discovered Wang's whereabouts. They sent a letter to Xie. After receiving the letter, Xie traveled to Shanghai and stayed with Wang and Dai in Room 613 of the Central Hotel on Hubei Road. He ordered the tea boy to summon Zhang Xianghua and Wang. Zhang, thinking it was business, happily brought Wang to Central Room 613. Xie, seeing that the prostitute was indeed his wife, became furious and detained Zhang. He reported the matter to the Laozha Police Station and ordered detectives to arrest Zhang and bring her to the police station. Yesterday, she was sent to the summary court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case and requested severe punishment according to Articles 146 and 248 of the Criminal Code. Xie and Wang testified. When questioned, Zhang confessed without hesitation. Judge Cheng Shangfeng verified the confession and sentenced Zhang Xianghua to five months in prison as a warning. Xie and Wang were released to Xie Xianlin.</p>

<p>Lawyer Wu Mai has been tirelessly advocating for the recovery of legal rights for the past year. Wherever he went, the people's spirits were greatly roused. Mr. Wu is currently the director of the Propaganda Department of the City Anti-Japanese Association and has given impassioned speeches at various large and small schools and organizations in and outside the city. His spirit is so moving that listeners are inspired to action. Mr. Wu recently told people, "The country is in such a state, what glory is there in living and what sorrow is there in dying for us citizens? Everyone is willing to die, everyone should die, and everyone is determined to save the country without considering personal gain or loss. What is there we dare not do, what is there we dare not say? Let everyone move forward with a fearless spirit." His words were often filled with indignation. His letters, articles, poems, lyrics, and couplets related to the nation, the people, and the public good have been compiled by his friend Liu Yuanlin and published under the title "Wu Mai's Collected Works" last month. His diaries from previous years are being organized by his friend Xu Wancheng, secretary of the National Advancement Society, and will be published in a few days, destined to be enjoyed by young people. This is not Wu Mai boasting of his literary talent, but rather a desire to inspire the people. "Wu Mai's Collected Works" are available for sale at various bookstores, including Dadong and Qingyun, at a price of 25 cents. Mail orders or bulk purchases can be sent directly to Xu Wancheng, Shanghai Women's Middle School, West Gate, and will be sent immediately.</p>

Ms. Li has lived in North China for a long time and knows well the ambition of the Japanese invaders to invade.

<p>(The Relationship Between the Japanese Cabinet Reorganization and Our Country)</p>
<p>The chief culprit of killing the Korean Empress Min, Adachi Kenzo, and his decades-old comrades have disagreed and brought down the Minseito cabinet, and organized a joint cabinet of various parties. He was originally a member of the Kokken party, and his views are different from those of Wakatsuki, who is backed by financial capitalists. With the success of this campaign, his foreign policy will inevitably be tougher, using the excuse of national unity to carry out the long-cherished aspirations of the Japanese people for decades. The Japanese people's aggressive stance is becoming increasingly prepared, but what about our country? The dawn of the Kuomintang's unification has just appeared, and the dark clouds have re-emerged. The rift between the government and the people is not only not disappearing, but is deepening day by day. Officials are lax and debauched, and they have not slightly changed the tyranny against the people, but instead are more arbitrary and self-serving. Patriotic students are arbitrarily beaten and robbed, and the people's mouthpiece is arbitrarily destroyed. The glorious proclamations declare the rule of law, but the party officials are the first to break the law. It is the people who want national unity, but the government does not allow it. The enemy is plotting against us, so urgently, what is the mentality of the ruling party that they have such actions?</p>
<p>(Note) The new Japanese cabinet has been ordered by Inukai Tsuyoshi to organize a joint cabinet. Some people are opposing it. All this has been seen in yesterday's newspaper. Mr. Zhang's letter has a very accurate and profound point of view. Therefore, it is shared with general readers.</p>

<p>The recent cooperation between the Economic Commission, which has recently been established in our country, and the League of Nations is tantamount to providing the stronger with weapons of economic aggression and the international joint management of the book policy. The evils are very profound, and the troubles are endless. The Economic Commission covers all industrial construction in our country, with a very wide scope. Now, if we cooperate with the League of Nations, we will directly entrust foreign experts to handle all matters needed for our country's material survival, as well as important policies such as education and health, just like the previous examples of the customs, post office, and salt administration. Therefore, the loss of national sovereignty is no less than Japan's invasion of our Northeast. However, few Chinese people pay attention to it. It is truly strange. I deeply hope that my compatriots will think about saving it, so as to avoid danger.</p>

<h3 id="e165">The Paradise-like Leprosarium at Penang Island <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>My friend Zhang Saojun, residing in Penang Island overseas, recently reported to me about the leprosarium there. He said that patients receiving treatment in the hospital not only have no worries about food, clothing, and shelter, but they can also participate in recreational teams, music organizations, and enjoy the convenience of planting, animal husbandry, and smoking. It is no less than a paradise outside the world. I believe that the organization of the hospital is very beneficial to those who are unfortunate and disabled by illness among us humans, so I will introduce it here.</p>
<p>Mount Erskine on Penang Island is the most common residence for pitiful leprosy patients. In addition to having no worries about food, clothing, and shelter, the insane people in the area also have doctors to examine them and provide them with therapeutic medications. According to the report from the local management authority, in 1930, 53 leprosy patients escaped from the area privately, 125 died, 4 were cured and released, and 16 were transferred elsewhere. A total of 1,058 people were admitted and treated this year, of which 211 were newcomers. As of December 31, 1930, the registered number of leprosy patients was 860.</p>
<p>Within the area, there are 54 thatched cottages, each housing two or three people, totaling 143 insane people. In front of each cottage, there is a small lawn for the insane people to stroll. Those patients who are able to work are encouraged to grow vegetables and fruits. Therefore, during this year, most of the thatched cottages were planted with vegetables and fruits in the back.</p>
<p>In the return settlement, there are 14 shelters, each accommodating more than 20 people, totaling 384 patients. Most of the leprosy patients in these shelters have reached the first stage and are mostly disabled. In addition, there is a mixed-race leprosy shelter, accommodating 16 people, including two overseas Chinese students and one from the Philippines. As for the new settlement, there are currently seven shelters, housing 315 patients, of which 211 are newcomers. In 1929, there were only 218 patients in the area. In 1930, the period with the largest number of patients was July 7, when there were 884 patients.</p>
<p>Doctors distinguish the severity of the disease of all leprosy patients and administer appropriate medications. Those with severe illnesses are given pills, while those with milder illnesses are given injections. A total of 5,871 injections were given throughout the year. In addition, four people were released because they were completely cured.</p>
<p>In this settlement, there is a recreational team. When it was first established, there were 14 people. The coach is a person with injuries. They are already able to perform various recreational activities. In the mixed-race leprosy ward, there is also a military band, instructed by Filipinos living in the ward. They are progressing rapidly and have their own musical instruments. A pig farm is established in the settlement, supplying nearby residents with about 1,000 pigs each year. Some leprosy patients are addicted to opium. The authorities have also allocated them a certain amount, but the government has now ordered the gradual reduction of the allocation. There are a total of 295 opium addicts, of which 87 need to smoke only once a day, 87 need to smoke twice a day, and the other 119 need to smoke three times a day. All opium smokers are housed in the old settlement.</p>
<p>As for the strong patients, the government gives them a job, or they grow vegetables and fruits themselves, and other operations such as pig farming. All the rewards obtained belong to them. Patients who are unable to work are given a monthly allowance of one yuan by the government for miscellaneous expenses. Therefore, this leprosarium has become a paradise outside the world.</p>
<p>The Mount Erskine leprosarium is exclusively for men. As for the leprosarium for women, it is located in Jelutong, with a total of 79 patients, of which 18 are newcomers. Four people were also released because they were completely cured. The condition of the remaining people has also improved considerably. In one year, ten people escaped privately, eight died, and four were transferred elsewhere. As of December 31, 1930, there were only 54 women in the ward.</p>
<p>Saving the pitiful disabled and insane people is the compassion and responsibility that we humans should have. May we have organizations like this leprosarium on Penang Island overseas for the unfortunate and insane people in China.</p>
