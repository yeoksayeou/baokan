<h3 id="c18">長江流域水患之新危機 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>日來長江上游積潦下瀉、排山倒海、若自天來、武漢三鎭、地勢低窪、首當其衝、於是江流晝夜陡漲、據十四日消息、水標已突破五十二英尺、漢市第三特别區水深一丈有餘、汪洋一片、有如湖澤、第一特别區亦全區入水、各處工廠、全部不能開工、即日本租界、雖防禦最力、亦已三分之二浸水、全市水勢、每小時平均漲高半英寸、災民浮沉水面、與死屍爲伍、仰天哀號、莫可奈何、尤可危者、據水利專家言、川襄兩水、尙有八丈、睚繼續到漢、是則三鎭百八十萬人口、其命運前途已呈現絶大之危機、念此慘刧、眞令人驚魂動魄、憂心如擣、</p>
<p>尤有甚者、在此禍水冲激之下、沿長江流域各埠、皆岌岌可危、其爲禍絶不止於武漢一處、蓋長江源出靑海、上流曰金沙江、至宜賓、納岷江、至　陵、納烏江、至湖南之洞庭、合湘資沅澧至湖北之漢陽納漢水、至江西鄱陽合贛江、至安徽之懷寗納皖水、至南京南納秦淮、北納滁河、至鎭鎭江穿運河、其下流更納瀏河吳淞江黃浦江、以入於海、此猶就其支流之大者而言、至於其他小流、更沿江分布、有若蛛網、本流所經達九行省、全長九千九百餘里、源遠流長、愈至下流、水量愈大、茲武漢旣已處於其威脅之下、則武漢以下、如九江如安慶如蕪湖如南京等已經被水之處、倘再益以巨潦、勢必更不堪設想、眼看禍水挾慘刧以東來、更令人不寒而慄、</p>
<p>故就目前嚴重情况言、急赈固爲重要、而預防此東來之洪流、尤爲刻不容緩、蓋洪流一至、大禍立臨、沿江各埠、即將全淪澤國、孑餘災黎、豈僅痛肉加刀、抑且逃死無所、其爲可危、實非任何事變所可比擬者也、</p>
<p>預防之道爲何、曰沿江各埠、大抵都爲水勢所匯、宜早就江岸增加堤防、原有各堤、亦應預加修築、俾免冲潰、此時各地駐軍、應積極動員、竭力從事於築堤排水、如前此駐紮江北張之江梁冠英部之搶水·成効可徵、各地災民、亦應寓賑於工、督其從事工作、尤宜積極宣傳、普告人民·以大難之即將來臨、促其急起自救、夫然後可免大刧、即不能全免、應亦可以使其不至驟然來臨、坐以待斃耳、</p>
<p>國府今已明令設立救濟水災委員會、將集中國内外之人力與財力、不分畛域、共策進行、對於此次之水災、固已特别重視·目前汹湧東來之禍水、即救濟水災委員會當前之緊急工作、萬望於此新危機、予以絶大之努力、</p>

<p>確乘自購飛機秘密離連</p>
<p>受人鼓惑誤認時機已至</p>
<p>圖結晉方將領又難如願</p>
<p>結果乃消極稱探視父病</p>
<p>北平通信、石友三失敗情形、已詳前訊、刻石已解决、華北軍事可告一段落、而閻錫山突然返晉、商震電呈蔣張辭晉主席、張電蔣轉請國府、任命徐永昌爲晋代主席、此中曲折、均與山西問題大有關係、而閻之返晉、是否如外間所傳僅探父病、亦爲一般人所注意、茲略誌如左、</p>
<p>閻錫山在大連、爲日人所包圍鼓惑、不曰石已佔保定、即曰石部距平津甚近、閻認爲時機已到、遂毅然於上月三十一日乘日人所備之飛機、由大連經石莊而抵太原、即召集各將領會議、旋以晉軍抵石、石部連日爲南北路及晉軍合擊潰敗、繳械遣散、决無復燃之可能、而晉將領意見、亦頗不一致、團結更大費周章、與大連日人所傳消息、適得其反、閻頗有悔意、態度頓形消極、近日空氣、已大不如前、閻因此不得不專以探望父病爲詞矣、</p>
<p>李培基原欲來平、路過大同、爲趙承綬截留、謂「閻先生給你有話說、」遂派兵保護李氏、赴晉晤閻、閻對李氏、除鼓勵奬慰外、並派李來平召商震回晉、今晚（十日）明晨（十一）可抵平、觀此則閻尙未盡放棄其團結晉將領之意也、</p>
<p>山西將領及西北將領態度、究竟如何、亦堪注意、山西本分四軍、商震一軍、因討石已帶出高鴻文黄光華周思誠三旅、與晉分離、即使經李培基到後挽勸、商亦决不返晉、可以斷言、傅作義向接近東北、傾向中央、故其軍隊、亦决不爲閻氏效死力、其餘徐永昌楊愛源二軍、徐於商震出兵石莊時、即主維持山西現狀、且與閻淵源非深、徐向來恬淡沈靜、如被閻逼迫、或將棄軍隊離晉、亦未可知、祗楊愛源一軍、與周玳砲兵及孫楚等、暫時或將一致、但孫素無主張、極不可靠、至馮氏部下之宋哲元及龐炳勳兩部、宋龐極端反對打仗、曾以個人去就與馮力爭、此實軍人之較有進步者、龐除與東北有相當關係外、並派人到南京向中央接洽、亦有相當諒解、結果如馮堅决打仗、恐宋龐即脫離軍隊、亦未可知、閻馮部下情形、如此複雜、將來結果、不卜可知至孫孫殿英已與劉峙訂妥聨防辦法、韓復榘屢次表示擁護中央、彼等旣不於石動時而動、當不致於閻動時而動、又可知也、</p>
<p>另一消息、閻錫山近以本人再起之時機成熟、並欲實踐與鄒海濱在大連會商之協定、决行返晉、號召一切、先是閻於半月前、曾經由某日文報主人之介紹、以十萬元向某機製會社購妥飛機一架、停放於周水子飛機塲、並先期聘妥一日人駕駛員、并担任護送（周水子爲南滿路大連下之第一大站、亦有長途汽車道可通行、）蓋閻固久已蓄意凌空回晉矣、至是乃於月之三日黎明、偕同該日駕駛員及其親信秘書靳瑞萱氏、於極秘密中、乘自用汽車抵周水子、旋由該飛行塲登機離連、當日晚間抵津、在日界某日友家中借宿一宵、四日清晨飛機加油後、復升機飛向大同、一說離連後沿途並未躭擱、即於當晚直抵太原、隨召開緊急會議、結果遂有四日反商（震）大會之發生、但又已後時、無能爲矣、</p>

<p>德孚（坎）（六丨二六丨四六丨一）史密斯（美）</p>
<p>德孚本年來自坎拿大、彼國名手之一、臂長過人、拍握如意、雙打是其拿手、單打亦甚佳妙、昨逢史密斯、隨手擊出、破敵陣綫、易如反掌、第一盤六比二、經過勝負、恍如一閃、第二盤史密斯攻守漸佳、頗有對抗氣象、顧未能久持、在四四之後、又見落風、不久又以四比六受挫、第三盤但見德孚長臂、左右疾揮、無往不利、史密斯戰鬥力全失、幾乎莫知所從、奪回一局、免嘗鴨蛋、猶屬不幸中之大幸、結果、德孚以六比一大勝、</p>

<p>俵積雄不愧單打名手、連劈三關、打敗英國宿將特克、第一盤、二人緊緊追隨、互相抵制、俵氏善用臂力、得手應心、特克賴其經騐、逢機即進、二二之後、俵氏專攻敵方弱點、特克不能糾、連失二局、顧努力反攻之下、即行奪回一局、大勢似有轉機、不料網拍失其均衡、非自殺於網前、即野出於淺外、長嘆一聲、乃以三比六失敗、第二盤、俵氏之勝、固在其藝術之高超、而特克一再自殺、角度失準、亦間接造成其勝利、結果六比一、第三盤特克應付艱雖、似感乏力、俵氏抽擊猛烈、猶如狂風暴寸令人不寒而慄、一連五局、全占勝利、特克困獸猶鬥、全身本領、盡量表演、奪回二局、稍有起色、俵氏深恐功虧一簣、努力加工、卒又以六比二得勝、</p>

<p>昨日上午、浦江内發生法郵船與日本貨輪互撞、兩方均受重大損失事件、此事經記者赴各方面詳細調查、茲將損壞情形、分誌如下、</p>
<p>兩輪撞碰狀况　法國郵船公司盎乾斯號、昨日上午十時二十分、在虹口招商局中棧裝齊貨客、啓椗出口、離埠之時、命會德豐拖輪、帶出吳淞、在碼頭開行之初、拖輪係打倒車至江心、再掉頭向東而去、在耶松造廠前一二兩號河筒上抛泊、有本埠昭和經理之川崎汽社貨船鮑特遜丸、Ｂordeaux　Moru係從美國舊金山運貨抵申、方在該河筒卸貨、詎法郵船身尙未掉正、即受激烈的潮水衝打、無法制住、法郵船船頭、乃向日輪船頭猛撞過去、砰然一響、兩輪均各撞壞、</p>
<p>船首各受巨傷　日船停在河筒上、被法郵船相撞之際、竟無法退讓、祇得聽其碰擊、日輪被撞之處、係在船頭部之正面、法船有一萬五千噸、又以潮力巨大、故一撞之下、其船頭竟被撞拆鐵板、毁壞輪首、曲斷朝天、驟望之、儼然無頭之輪矣、而法郵船之受反激力、其船頭之左側面、亦因撞力過重、外舷鐵板破裂、撞一大洞、幸在水綫之上、故未曾浸水、但損失亦殊巨大、</p>
<p>派員勘騐損壞　此事發生以後、由日輪報告昭和洋行、並通知法郵船公司、會報海關港務局長、由兩行各派公正司、會報海關港務局長、由兩行各派公正人到輪、會勘兩船損壞之處、並查詢肇禍眞相、關於責任問題、將另行交涉、法郵船以不能誤期、當時仍即開行出口、其損壞之洞、祗得沿途小修、俟到法後、再行入廠、而日輪船頭、業已撞癟須在滬上大修、昨已趕卸貨物、俟清艙後、再行入塢、今次兩輪撞壞、損失須數萬金云、</p>

<p>皖棧淹没　昨日本埠各輪公司接得安慶來電、謂皖中大水、近日受上游水勢暴漲之影響、江水日夕高增、已經淹入陸地、沿江各輪公司之碼頭、全入水中、各貨棧下層、已完全没於水中、客家則不能提卸、請上海趕速停止裝安慶貨、現各界正在搶救之中、</p>

<p>— 海客</p>
<p>結婚禮後的擲皮鞋</p>
<p>歐美男女行過了結婚禮以後。登車去度蜜月時。他們的親友往往將許多舊皮鞋紛紛的擲去。這是一種慣常的風俗。大家已恬不爲怪了。據一般人說。它的來源極古。最初創自埃及。那時有許多種族。將婦人當作一種財貨。猶太人尤其如此。與人交易時。即遞與一鞋或一履。作爲定局。婦女嫁人時。等於做一種交易。所以也用得着鞋履。降至現在。便以誤傳誤。成了抛擲皮鞋的風俗了。</p>
<p>又有人說。在野蠻的種族中。盛行刦婚之風。新郎往往匹馬單身。趕到新娘家裏。將新娘生生地刦去。伊的家人那肯干休。出來追趕。追趕不及。只得在後百將東西抛擲上去。藉以洩忿。不道這野蠻的風俗。到現在竟被文明人所採用了。</p>
<p>撒克遜人Saxons的舊俗。。女子出嫁時。伊的父親總得將伊的一隻鞋子授與新郎。新郎接在手中。就放在新娘額上接觸一下。表示以後可以管敎伊了。這也是古代的遺風。而到了現代。不知不覺的纏誤了。</p>

<p>— 更新</p>
<p>德國克倫特敎授近在波克門科學研究會年會席上。有一驚人之報告。即在煤中可以榨取蛋白質之新發見也。據克博士云。關於煤之某種副産物與動物的蛋白質之關聨性。彼已證明成立。此種新發見。確甚重要。因在生産之價值一方面而論。煤製蛋白質較之動物的産物。實易於競爭也。雖以人造品代替天然品爲食物。現尙非其時。然用礦物的蛋白質充作食料。則頗具可能性。並聞克氏此項新發見。將再作大規模之實騐。以期可以應用而利世云。</p>

<p>— 文初寄自馬里剌</p>
<p>菲人要求獨立之熱烈。可謂再接再厲。以現時執政鉅公。及實業界商家。自是一種敷衍態度。蓋美人欲爭太平洋海權。不能捨棄東方海軍根據地。而諸大商家。亦不願每年一萬五千餘萬貨物輸入菲島。一旦與他國同受關稅之束縛。（菲島海關收入。美國爲宗主國。有免稅特惠權。故每年入口。美貨佔百分之六十五。）但菲糖運美。亦享免稅特惠權。美國南省爲糖出産地。於貿易上受競爭影響。該省國會議員。大唱即時允許菲島獨立。以免有碍美國農業。此國會中所以時有人道……公理……聲調。儼若爲菲人鳴不平者。</p>
<p>美參議員何威氏。爲最贊成菲島獨立者。此番來菲考察政治社會狀况。爲他日在美國會中討論材料。菲立法院。以菲人應有明確表示。俾何威氏留有深刻印象。故於前星期日籌備獨立游行。表明菲人對獨立要求。出自多數民衆有理性之公意。</p>
<p>凡馬里刺及附近各省在職政府人員。不論官階大小。并立案社團。各大工廠。皆須加入游行。各省在職人員及社團。由火車公司許以特别免費狀。故是日火車乘客。十分擁擠。各社團并催軍樂隊助興。加入人數。共有十五萬餘。國會庭前及乘凉地大草場。站立幾無隙地。電車汽車馬車斷絶交通幾三小時。</p>
<p>是日加入男女各界。皆穿菲島出産自製一種普通制服。三十一年前退位第一任共和總統亞基那度將軍。及現任衆院長羅夏氏。亦手執獨立旗。身穿平民制服爲前導。惟學校方面。爲不能加入任何政治運動定例所束縛。故中大各學生。祗能以個人加入游行。不能用各校名義云。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>是日余游鹿苑沙拿大學北部之小村。房屋低小。尙係黄瓦房。距沙拿遺墟只隔一河。此河似非長河。或一大池也。不能辨之。其中有數牧女及牛。由此向村中去。無大路。樹木亦少。而沙拿以南道路。何其齊整也。如上海租界之路矣。樹木亦高大。村中樹小多仙人掌。旁有麥田。男女正收麥。乾季無雨。多塵土。村中多白牛。小兒何其黑也。余觀小兒之黑。知確係種族關係矣。印人最講血統。不與他族通婚。然其種貌殊不優於他族。惟素食接神。淡泊寡欲耳。雖然。印人長於内明之學。兒不嫌母醜。狗不嫌家貧。今萬國皆執弟子禮以禮佛及印度敎。吾又何暇以肉眼觀印度之黑人乎。莊子曰。道與之貌。天與之形矣。印人不講工農。田禾不茂。收穫之量。當不佳也。因其多畜牛。故收牛糞。而團成餅以燃燒之。到處皆然。與中國北部同。余常過各村。印犬似不甚咬人也。抑鄉村皆係貧人。屬第四級之劣等民族。只有敬畏以上之三族而已。</p>
<p>余問錫蘭法師。佛之王族今尙有存者乎。法師答曰無也。旁一紳士云釋種當時見惡於某王。某王將殲其族。問曰若願留其種族者留若干。男女通婚可也。釋種答不願留。某王遂盡殺之。余不甚記憶。似琉璃王伐釋種事也。其時佛尙在世矣。佛本視怨親平等。四大皆空。其後代竟無一人。非佛所慮矣。余又問佛族之戚屬。尙有存者乎。其人亦不知。良久云。佛之舊都迦比羅城。今爲廢墟。其戚屬若有存者。或在尼泊爾國。訪問之因地近尼泊爾也。余按經用科學研究。將來調和世界殺機者惟在用通婚法。以大混合血統。試觀釋種之盡被殺。未始非不與他族通婚之故也。</p>

<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>這邊的事且按下不題。單說小榮的妻子乘車到了同孚路，依照了李先生告訴伊的門牌號數，一尋就尋到了丁小姐的家裏。</p>
<p>伊很畏怯，起初實在覺得没有這個膽量敢去敲着那兩扇門；但是後來畢竟給憤怒的情感燃燒得克制不住了。就走上前去，用力把門敲着。</p>
<p>丁小姐恰巧從蘇州回來，到家裏還不過兩小時光景，正在樓上打瞌睡，一聽得下面有人敲門，却不按電鈴，自然覺得很奇怪，就喊着秋子，呌伊去看看敲門的是誰。秋子正在裏面的房間裏，起初也没有聽見，給丁小姐一喊，就趕快到樓下去開門。</p>
<p>小榮的妻子本來是含着滿腔怨憤而來，只是看見了人却又發洩不出，當秋子開門出來的時候，却呆住了，覺得不知說了什麽話好。</p>
<p>「你找那一個？」秋子一看敲門的是一個不相識的女人，心裏好生奇怪。</p>
<p>「我是來尋小榮的！」伊毫不思索地說。</p>
<p>「小榮麽？這裏没有這樣一個人啊！你尋錯了人家哩！」</p>
<p>「那麽這裏是不是姓丁呢？」小榮的妻子有些發急了。</p>
<p>「正是！」秋子回答。</p>
<p>「你們不是有一位小姐到過蘇州去的麽？」</p>
<p>「是的！你問他做甚？」</p>
<p>「我便是來尋那個同着你們這裏的小姐一同到蘇州去的那個姓陸的！」</p>
<p>「啊！是陸先生！你不早說！他不呌小榮啊！但是你尋他有什麽事呢？」秋子很有些懷疑了。</p>
<p>小榮的妻子看見秋子很和善，只覺得滿腔的怨憤没有地方好發洩，反而低聲地告訴着說：「他是我的丈夫？……我有要緊的話要當面跟他說呢！」</p>
<p>秋子也幾乎不相信了！他腦裏想起了陸先生的模樣兒來，眼前又看見那個稱陸先生爲丈夫的女人的模樣兒，就覺得糊塗起來，摸不着頭腦，只驚奇地說：「怎麽？那個陸先生是你的丈夫麽？」</p>
<p>「我怎麽含胡亂認着呢？你就去呌他出來吧！」小榮的妻子又耐住了氣，帶着央求的神情說。</p>
<p>「陸先生是來過了又出去了！但是等我去對我們小姐說吧！你等着，也許我們的小姐會見見你哩。」秋子眞是聰敏，伊立刻就理會得這一件事情的重大性。</p>
<p>一面，小榮的妻子也只有在門外等候着：一面，秋子就飛步上樓去報告。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chinese and Japanese Concessions <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<h3 id="e2">The Embankment on the Yangtze River Collapsed Yesterday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Floodwaters Pour into the Japanese Concession</p>
<p>Flood Prevention Efforts Completely Abandoned</p>
<p>Power Outage at the Power Plant Due to Flooding</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Yangtze River's water level had slightly receded in the past few days, but recently, due to torrential floods surging down from the upper reaches, and the Hai River simultaneously experiencing a surge, making it impossible to discharge the water, the river continued to rise. Dangerous conditions are occurring everywhere. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The embankment built facing the Yangtze River, about 16 zhang away from the Japanese Concession's Naval Club, collapsed this morning. Turbid water rushed into the concession, causing the Mitsubishi warehouse to collapse. All Chinese and Japanese shops in the concession have been destroyed. The Japanese Concession is increasingly flooded, with the water level reaching four to five feet in the lowest areas. However, the buildings of the Japanese Consulate General, the Naval Club, the Japanese Elementary School, and the Tongren Hospital are making their last stand in flood prevention by utilizing brick walls and other flood barriers. (15th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Although the Japanese Concession's flood prevention efforts were continued with a do-or-die effort by Japanese residents, aided by the marines, they ultimately could not resist the overflow of the great Yangtze River. By last night, they had exhausted all strategies. At 12:05 AM this morning, they had no choice but to tearfully abandon all flood prevention efforts. As a result, turbid currents from all directions surged into the concession. By 2:00 AM, the water depth had reached four to seven feet. Furniture, mats, and kitchen utensils in Japanese residences were completely washed away, and people barely escaped with their lives to the upper floors. Chaos was extreme in the middle of the night. The Hankou Resident Group decided to abandon flood prevention efforts and simultaneously opened the Resident Group Office and the Meiji Elementary School to accommodate Japanese refugees. At 2:40 AM, the machinery room of the Resident Group's electrical department was also flooded by several feet, leading to a power outage. The concession instantly turned into a dark area, not only making it more difficult for the disaster victims to take refuge but also plunging all of Hankou, except for a part of the Chinese street, into darkness. The sound of the raging water and the cries of the disaster victims echoed in the night, making it unbearable to hear. Suddenly, a fire broke out in a Hankou bank warehouse operated by Japanese, causing even greater chaos, but fortunately, it was quickly extinguished. (15th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Japanese Resident Group's power plant was completely destroyed in an instant due to its location. As people wanted to purchase kerosene lamps and candles, but all the stores were destroyed, they were difficult to obtain. As people wanted to purchase food, but the small boats used for transportation were limited, even if one could get on one, there was no way to buy anything. Moreover, there were unstable elements and starving people looting and rioting. The danger was even greater after sunset. Currently, except for the Japanese Consulate General, Tongren Hospital, Elementary School, Naval Club, and a few other places, the entire Japanese Concession is flooded. The halls of various restaurants have all turned into indoor swimming pools. Wuhan's only Japanese newspaper, "Hankou Daily," is now unable to publish. The Japanese Resident Group held its first administrative committee meeting since the flood at 5:00 PM today to discuss emergency relief measures for issues such as electricity, transportation, food, sanitation, and the handling of the deceased. (15th Domei News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) We spent a terrifying and uneasy night without any sleep last night. However, the water level continues to rise, so that even the last surviving Japanese Concession has had to entrust itself to the turbid currents. As far as the eye can see, it's all a vast expanse of water. Transportation within the Japanese Concession relies solely on small boats as the only means of transport. From now on, the purchase of food, the handling of disaster victims, and the disposal of waste are all matters of utmost urgency. After discussing the methods, the Resident Group Committee decided to transport the remaining women and children to Shanghai in several batches. There is sunshine today, but the temperature has reached 95 or 96 degrees. The combination of water and heat is a cause for concern for future problems. Fortunately, there are currently no deaths or injuries. (15th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) After leaving Beiping, Gu Zhutong passed through the Pinghan Line to handle military affairs. He will pass through Xuzhou by special train on the evening of the 15th and return to Nanjing. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a Beiping telegram, Liu Zhi, Gu Zhutong, Shang Zhen, and the northern army generals held a meeting in Beiping. The results were: (1) Closely monitor Yan Xishan's actions; (2) Shang Zhen's troops will be stationed in the original defense area of Shi Yousan; (3) The central army going north will be entirely demobilized. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Shi's Generals</p>
<h3 id="e5">Zhang Expresses No Intention to Pursue the Matter <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Discusses the Course of the Battle</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang believes that many officers of Shi's army were merely following orders and are therefore excusable. He has decided not to pursue the matter against Shi's generals. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, Yu Xuezhong spoke to reporters in great detail about the course of the battle. According to him, the most intense fighting occurred on the 28th, 29th, and 33rd days. After this battle, our side issued an attack order on the 31st, and Shi's troops took advantage of the rain to escape. All armies then pursued and annihilated Shi's troops. In short, this time we lured the enemy deep, skillfully set up a pocket formation, waited for them to become exhausted, and achieved a miraculous victory in one battle. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) More than 70 representatives of the anti-taxation group have come to Beiping. They will welcome Yu Xuezhong within days and express their gratitude for resolving the Shi affair and maintaining local order. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liu Guitang Claims</p>
<h3 id="e6">To Relinquish the Authority of Brigade Commander <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>And Not Be Responsible for Any Post-Affair</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Guitang's troops stationed in Daming have been disturbing the local population. Chiang ordered Xu Tingyao's troops to be responsible for resolving the matter. Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Liu yesterday, ordering him to come to Beiping for questioning. On the 11th, Liu Guitang telegraphed all parties, reporting that he was ill and would be admitted to Daming Hospital for treatment that day. The authority of the 6th Brigade Commander has been handed over to Liu Huaizhi, the regimental commander, to handle all matters. He will not be responsible for any post-affairs. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to foreigners, Liu Guitang's troops have been disarmed by the Central Fourth Division. Liu himself was not in Daming and had gone to Tianjin beforehand. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Yan and Feng Will Go to Dalian Together <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yan Xishan recently told people that his father's illness has recovered, and he has decided to return to Dalian. He is currently planning the route and safety and will be able to set off soon. Feng Yuxiang originally intended to recuperate in Jiang County, but recently someone advised Feng to go to Dalian with Yan. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shanxi generals are requesting the revocation of the arrest warrant for Yan. Xu Yongchang and Vice Zhang are currently discussing this by telegram. The Northwest Army is still stationed in its original defense area and is undergoing regular training. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a Beiping telegram, the Deputy Commander has announced that Yan Xishan's return to Shanxi is to visit his father's illness and he does not intend to interfere in politics or military affairs. Li Shizeng in Beiping telegraphed Yan Xishan, advising him that the central government is considering revoking the arrest warrant against him and that he should not support the reactionary forces with weak hope, so as not to harm his future. It is also said that Feng Yuxiang in Jiang County intends to go to Wutai Mountain to escape the summer heat and also claims that he will go abroad after autumn, but this remains to be seen. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain news agency, Yan Xishan's return to Shanxi will not affect the current situation. Yan is timid and lacks ambition, values money as his life, and has a very strong sense of localism. He is not accustomed to being a fugitive. Because the central government is advocating peace with Guangdong, he took the opportunity to return to the country and begged Li Yuying, Zhang Ji, Kong Xiangxi, and others to plead for the cancellation of the arrest warrant on his behalf. Li and others telegraphed the central government, but the central government's intention is that Yan must first telegraph a repentance before there is room for discussion. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Various Circles in Beiping</p>
<h3 id="e8">Gave a Banquet for Wang and Yu Last Night <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>

Shao Yuanchong said, please ask the Legislative Committee to conduct a strict review and revision of the entire regulations, strictly stipulate restrictions, and explain them again and again when submitting them to the government to implement the policy of prohibiting opium.

<h3 id="e18">New Crisis of Flooding in the Yangtze River Basin <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, accumulated water in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has been discharging downstream, overwhelming the mountains and seas, as if from the sky. Wuhan, with its three towns and low-lying terrain, bears the brunt. As a result, the river has been rising steeply day and night. According to news on the 14th, the water mark has exceeded 52 feet, and the Third Special District of Wuhan City is more than 1 zhang deep in water, a vast expanse like a lake. The First Special District is also entirely flooded, and all factories everywhere are unable to operate. Even the Japanese Concession, despite the strongest defenses, is two-thirds flooded. The city's water level is rising at an average of half an inch per hour. Disaster victims float on the water with corpses, wailing to the sky, helpless. What is even more dangerous, according to hydraulic experts, is that the waters of Sichuan and Xiang are still eight zhang away and will continue to reach Hankou. In that case, the fate and future of the 1.8 million people in the three towns are presenting an enormous crisis. Thinking of this tragic disaster, it is truly soul-stirring and causes worry like a pounding in the chest.</p>
<p>What's more, under the impact of this disaster, ports along the Yangtze River basin are all in imminent danger. The disaster is definitely not limited to Wuhan. The Yangtze River originates in Qinghai, the upper reaches are called the Jinsha River. It merges with the Min River at Yibin, with the Wu River at Fuling, with the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li Rivers at Dongting in Hunan, with the Han River at Hanyang in Hubei, with the Gan River at Poyang in Jiangxi, with the Wan River at Huaining in Anhui, with the Qinhuai River in the south and the Chu River in the north at Nanjing, and passes through the Grand Canal at Zhenjiang. Its lower reaches merge with the Liu River, Wusong River, and Huangpu River to enter the sea. This is just in terms of the larger tributaries. As for other smaller streams, they are even more distributed along the river like a spider web. The main stream passes through nine provinces, with a total length of over 9,900 li. It originates far away and flows for a long time, and the water volume increases the further downstream it goes. Now that Wuhan is already under its threat, the situation below Wuhan, such as Jiujiang, Anqing, Wuhu, and Nanjing, which have already been flooded, will inevitably be even more unimaginable if they are further flooded by torrents. Watching the disaster bringing tragedy eastward, it is even more chilling.</p>
<p>Therefore, in terms of the current serious situation, emergency relief is important, but preventing this eastward flowing torrent is even more urgent. Once the torrent arrives, disaster will strike immediately, and the ports along the river will be completely submerged. The remaining disaster victims will not only feel the pain of adding knives to their flesh, but also have nowhere to escape death. Its danger is truly incomparable to any other incident.</p>
<p>What is the way to prevent it? It can be said that the ports along the river are mostly where the water converges. The dikes should be increased along the river banks as soon as possible, and the existing dikes should also be repaired in advance to avoid collapse. At this time, the troops stationed in various places should be actively mobilized and do their best to build dikes and drain water, just as the troops of Zhang Zhijiang and Liang Guanying stationed in Jiangbei previously engaged in flood control with remarkable results. Disaster victims in various places should also be given work in exchange for relief and supervised to engage in work. In particular, active publicity should be carried out to widely inform the people of the impending disaster and urge them to rise up and save themselves. Only then can we avoid major disasters. Even if we cannot completely avoid them, we should be able to prevent them from arriving suddenly and waiting to die.</p>
<p>The National Government has now issued a clear order to establish a Flood Relief Committee, which will gather the manpower and financial resources from both inside and outside the country, regardless of boundaries, to work together. The government has paid special attention to this flood. The current eastward flowing disaster is the urgent work of the Flood Relief Committee. It is hoped that the government will devote its utmost efforts to this new crisis.</p>

<p>Government Attitude Unchanged</p>
<p>Struggle Will Inevitably Resume</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 14th - The atmosphere here today is more hopeful. Sapru and Jayakar have emerged as mediators. Responsible parties say that negotiations for the All-India Congress to participate in the Round Table Conference have not been closed. At the same time, important figures, including key representatives who will attend the Round Table Conference on behalf of India, are constantly meeting with Gandhi. Furthermore, the All-India Working Committee has fully authorized the former speaker of the Legislative Assembly, Patel, to take swift action in the final period if necessary. This action directly makes Patel a de facto dictator in case of emergencies. The resolution of the Working Committee states that if an unforeseen event occurs and it is impossible to convene the Working Committee, President Patel may act in the name of the Working Committee. The Working Committee also declared that the resolution not to participate in the Round Table Conference should not be interpreted as a cancellation of the Delhi Agreement. Therefore, all organs and members of the Nationalist Party should continue to abide by the terms of the Delhi Agreement unless specific orders are received. Before departing for Ahmedabad, Gandhi told people that the All-India Congress will actively strive not to resume the non-violent resistance movement until the Round Table Conference has completed its discussions, but this will also depend on the attitude of the government. If the Round Table Conference does not allow the Nationalist Party's petition, the struggle will inevitably resume, and it will be more rigorous and extensive than before.</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 15th - The correspondence between Gandhi and the Viceroy and officials of the Indian government, totaling less than 10,000 words, has now been published. Gandhi pointed out actions that violated the Irwin-Gandhi Agreement, especially his dissatisfaction with coercive taxation. The Viceroy and government officials categorically denied these charges. Gandhi believes that the reply contains an indication that he does not need to go to England to attend the meeting, while the government's attitude is that the Indian government cannot agree to suspend ordinary laws or the existing administrative mechanisms.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 15th - The Indian Muslim representative to the London Round Table Conference, Shafi, along with other representatives such as Sapru and 26 others, boarded the Murdan mail steamer for England today. Before departing, Shafi declared, "May the Almighty allow me to return to India with peace and freedom."</p>
<p>Reuters, Ahmedabad, 15th - Gandhi told a Reuters representative today that his talks with Sapru and Jayakar did not affect the current situation. When the Reuters representative asked whether he would be willing to travel to London if the Viceroy did not appoint an arbitrator on the matter of land tax collection, but only guaranteed an investigation by the Viceroy and the Governor of Bombay to determine whether there was a significant violation of the Irwin-Gandhi Agreement, Gandhi replied that it was not certain.</p>

<p>Kokumin, Tokyo, 15th - American aviators Pun Bang and Hendon, who attempted to exceed Post Gattis's record of eight and a half days for a quick round-the-world flight, were detained by the Japanese authorities a week ago after mistakenly landing at a military airfield near Tokyo. Today, the court ruled that they were each fined 2,000 yen for violating the Japanese Aviation Law, and 50 yen each for flying over a fortress area.

<p>Reuters, Paris, 14th - French Prime Minister Laval and Foreign Minister Briand were unable to visit Berlin on the 26th and 27th of this month, as proposed in the German government's invitation, due to Briand's poor health. The French Prime Minister informed the German Ambassador to France that the renowned physician Fick did not allow Briand to go to Berlin this month, so the visit to Germany would have to be postponed until after the League of Nations Assembly convenes in September. Briand is doing well, but the doctor has instructed him to rest quietly in the countryside for a month before attending the League of Nations Conference in Geneva. The French Prime Minister cabled the German Prime Minister tonight, saying that he was very sorry that Briand's health condition did not allow him to visit Berlin on the original date, and that he was eager to continue the talks that began in Paris last month as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Kokumin, Havana, 14th - Cuban revolutionary leader and former President Minocal was captured by government forces in Pinar del Río and is now being transported to the capital as a prisoner. Colonel Mendietta, who was second in command in the revolutionary army after Minocal, was also captured by government forces. Therefore, the government now believes that with the capture of these two men, the revolutionary army has suffered a major blow and will soon be quelled. It is reported that the capture of the two men happened just after the revolutionary party organ here declared that Minocal had issued an ultimatum to the current president, demanding his resignation within 24 hours. Yesterday, the current president led his guards out of the capital to pacify the revolutionary party nearby, but to no avail. Government forces then engaged in battle with the revolutionary army. Initially, the revolutionary army was victorious and had pursued the government forces to a point not far from the capital. This is why Minocal issued the ultimatum. Unexpectedly, he suddenly became a prisoner. Although the war has not yet ended, the government expects the revolutionary army to surrender and allow Minocal and his captured leaders to receive lenient treatment.</p>

The committee also drafted a uniform format for ship manifests and tonnage slips. The above-mentioned draft will now be submitted to the governments of all countries. If they all agree, the measurement of commercial ship tonnage worldwide will have consistent rules.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e57">Inside Story of Yan's Return to Shanxi <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Indeed Secretly Left Dalian on a Privately Purchased Plane</p>
<p>Misled by Others, Mistakenly Believing the Time Had Come</p>
<p>Attempting to Unite Shanxi Generals Again, but Difficult to Fulfill</p>
<p>Resulting in Passive Claim of Visiting Father's Illness</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The details of Shi Yousan's defeat have been reported previously. Now that Shi has been dealt with, the military situation in North China can be said to have come to an end. Yan Xishan's sudden return to Shanxi, Shang Zhen's telegram to Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang resigning from the chairmanship of Shanxi, and Zhang's telegram to Chiang asking the National Government to appoint Xu Yongchang as the acting chairman of Shanxi, all have a close relationship with the Shanxi issue. Whether Yan's return to Shanxi is solely for visiting his father's illness, as rumored outside, is also a matter of general concern. Here is a brief account:</p>
<p>While in Dalian, Yan Xishan was surrounded and misled by the Japanese, who kept saying that Shi had occupied Baoding or that Shi's troops were very close to Tianjin and Beiping. Yan believed that the time had come, so he resolutely took a plane prepared by the Japanese on the 31st of last month, passed through Shijiazhuang from Dalian, and arrived in Taiyuan. He immediately convened a meeting of the generals. Subsequently, the Jin army resisted Shi, and Shi's troops were defeated, disarmed, and dismissed in a combined attack by the north-south roads and the Jin army. There was absolutely no possibility of resurgence. The opinions of the Jin generals were also quite divergent, and unity was even more difficult. This was the opposite of the news spread by the Japanese in Dalian, and Yan was quite regretful. His attitude suddenly became passive. The atmosphere has recently been much worse than before. Therefore, Yan had no choice but to use the excuse of visiting his father's illness.</p>
<p>Li Peiji originally wanted to come to Beiping, but was intercepted by Zhao Chengshou in Datong, who said, "Mr. Yan has something to say to you." He then sent troops to protect Li to meet with Yan in Shanxi. Yan, in addition to encouraging and rewarding Li, also sent Li to Beiping to summon Shang Zhen back to Shanxi. Tonight (10th) and tomorrow morning (11th), he can arrive in Beiping. From this, it can be seen that Yan has not completely given up on uniting the Jin generals.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy what the attitude of the Shanxi and Northwest generals is. Shanxi is divided into four armies. Shang Zhen's army, because of the campaign against Shi, has already taken out the three brigades of Gao Hongwen, Huang Guanghua, and Zhou Sicheng, separating from Shanxi. Even if Li Peiji arrives later to persuade him, Shang will definitely not return to Shanxi, which can be asserted. Fu Zuoyi is approaching the Northeast and leaning towards the Central Government, so his troops will definitely not die for Yan. Of the remaining two armies of Xu Yongchang and Yang Aiyuan, Xu advocated maintaining the status quo of Shanxi when Shang Zhen sent troops to Shijiazhuang, and his relationship with Yan is not deep. Xu has always been indifferent and quiet. If Yan is forced, he may abandon the army and leave Shanxi. Only Yang Aiyuan's army, Zhou Dai's artillery, and Sun Chu, etc., may temporarily be united, but Sun has no opinion and is extremely unreliable. As for the two troops of Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun under Feng's command, Song and Pang extremely opposed fighting and argued with Feng, even considering their own departure. These are really more progressive soldiers. In addition to having a considerable relationship with the Northeast, Pang also sent people to Nanjing to contact the Central Government, and there is also a considerable understanding. As a result, if Feng is determined to fight, Song and Pang may withdraw from the army, which cannot be known. The situation of Yan and Feng's subordinates is so complicated that the future result cannot be predicted. Sun Dianying has already reached a joint defense agreement with Liu Zhi, and Han Fuju has repeatedly expressed his support for the Central Government. Since they did not move when Shi moved, they should not move when Yan moves, which can also be known.</p>
<p>Another message is that Yan Xishan recently felt that the time for his re-emergence had matured and that he wanted to fulfill the agreement he had discussed with Zou Haibin in Dalian, so he decided to return to Shanxi, calling on everything. Previously, half a month ago, through the introduction of the owner of a certain Japanese newspaper, Yan had already purchased a plane from a certain machinery company for 100,000 yuan, parked it at Zhou Shuizi Airport, and hired a Japanese pilot in advance to be responsible for escorting him (Zhou Shuizi is the largest station under the South Manchuria Railway's Dalian, and there are also long-distance bus routes available). Yan had long intended to return to Shanxi in the air. Thus, at dawn on the 3rd of the month, accompanied by the Japanese pilot and his trusted secretary, Mr. Jin Ruixuan, he arrived at Zhou Shuizi in a very secret manner by private car, and then boarded the plane from the airport and left Dalian. He arrived in Tianjin that night and stayed overnight at the home of a certain Japanese friend in the Japanese Concession. After refueling the plane on the morning of the 4th, he took off again and flew towards Datong. According to one account, he did not delay along the way after leaving Dalian, and arrived directly in Taiyuan that night, where he convened an emergency meeting. As a result, the anti-Shang (Zhen) conference was held on the 4th, but it was already too late and powerless.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Chief of Staff Wang Shuchang Triumphant Arrival in Tianjin <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Claims Hebei Province People Suffered 20 Million in Losses</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: In this military action against Shi (Yousan)'s army, the Northeast Second Army, originally assigned to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line, dug trenches more than ten miles south of Cangxian County, traversing east-west for about a hundred miles. The trenches were five feet deep. Later, because the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line no longer presented a target for the enemy, they built trenches along the Cangxian-Shijiazhuang Railway line instead. The Northeast First Army, to lure the enemy deeper, abandoned territory south of Baoding. Consequently, the Second Army's trenches on the Cangxian-Shijiazhuang road faced an exceptionally fierce attack by Shi's army on Baoding. Shi's forces pressed the Northeast Army with five divisions, occupying Baoding on the 29th of last month. On the 30th, Yu Xuezhong urgently transferred rear reserve troops to join the counterattack. Simultaneously, Wang Shuchang ordered the First Army to flank Shi's army's right rear from Gaoyang. By the 31st, Shi's army had completely collapsed. The Northeast Army, fearing public unrest, initially denied the fall of Baoding. Now that Shi has been defeated, they no longer conceal the fact. The Hebei Provincial Government and the Tianjin and Beijing Municipal Governments, in addition to raising funds to purchase goods to慰劳 (wèi láo - comfort/console) the soldiers, jointly planned a triumphal welcome for Yu Xuezhong and Wang Shuchang. The Provincial Government erected decorated archways at the east and west of the yamen and the new railway station, adorned with the characters "恭祝凯旋 (gōng zhù kǎi xuán - Congratulations on the Triumphant Return)". Yesterday morning (the 12th) at 9:00 AM, they officially delegated Construction Bureau Chief Lin Chengxiu and Industry Bureau Chief He Yufang to take the Tianjin-Pukou train to Tangguantun to welcome him. Unexpectedly, while Lin and He were en route, Wang had already arrived in Tianjin at 10:00 AM on a special train with a platoon of guards. At 11:45 AM, the special train arrived at the station. Civil Affairs Bureau Chief Wang Yuke, Finance Bureau Chief Yao Hong, Provincial Government Committee member Chen Baoquan, Tianjin Customs Superintendent Han Linsheng, Tianjin-Pukou Railway Tianjin Office Director Gao Hengru, and others all welcomed him at the station. After disembarking, Wang immediately took a car back to his residence at No. 16 Road, Special District One. Leaders of various agencies and representatives from various sectors then went to Wang's residence, where Wang met with them in batches, finishing only at 2:00 PM. At 3:00 PM, he went to the Provincial Government to work. At 4:30 PM, he met with newspaper reporters in the large reception room. Wang stated that the Second Army comprised four infantry brigades (8th Brigade: Ding Xichun, 15th Brigade: Yao Dongfan, 17th Brigade: Huang Shiyue, 20th Brigade: Chang Jiwu), three cavalry brigades (4th Brigade: Guo Xipeng, 5th Brigade: Li Fuhe, 6th Brigade: Liu Guitang), and one artillery regiment (the 12th Regiment under the 7th Brigade commanded by Qiao Fang). However, only the Huang and Chang infantry brigades, and the Guo and Li cavalry brigades engaged in combat with Shi's army. From the 30th to the 31st of last month, there was a fierce battle at Dali Gezhuang, after which Shi's army collapsed. Besides the capture of the Mi Wenhe and Sun Guangqian Divisions, and the surrender of the Shen Keyi Division, the remainder gathered in Dezhou. Currently, there are no Shi's troops in Hebei Province, only a small number of scattered defeated soldiers, inevitable. Therefore, the Second Army cannot be demobilized for the time being and is currently stationed around Hejian, Renqiu, Gaoyang, and Cangxian counties, engaged in clearing the countryside. Although this military action concluded quickly, over ninety counties have suffered from the ravages of war. The average loss per county is estimated at 100,000 yuan, amounting to 10 million yuan. Over forty counties were included in the war zone, and much of the crops were destroyed. The average loss per county is estimated at 200,000 yuan, amounting to 9 million yuan. Shi Yousan, due to a momentary lapse in judgment, has caused the people of Hebei Province to suffer such a great disaster, and he should feel remorse. I have already ordered the Civil Affairs Bureau to conduct a swift investigation and request the Deputy Commander's Headquarters to find ways to provide relief. Since our army will not be demobilized for the time being, the Second Army Headquarters will also remain temporarily in Tangguantun. After Wang finished speaking, he returned to his private residence. This morning (the 13th) at 8:00 AM, Wang departed for Beijing to report everything to Zhang Xueliang. (August 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Cao Fulin Completes Inspection of Shi's Troops <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Shi Yousan Confirmed to Have Gone to Dalian from Jiaozhou Bay</p>
<p>Zhang Huanan and Others Arrested in Jinan Accompanied Him</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the defeated soldiers of Shi Yousan's army gathered in Linyi, Han Fuju ordered Cao Fulin to be responsible for inspection and reorganization. According to a telegram from Yucheng at 8:00 PM on the 12th, Cao Fulin, with many staff and adjutants, took a car from Yucheng to Linyi at 6:00 AM on the 12th. He immediately met with Liu Shuxiang and Shi's Chief of Staff Tang Bangzhi, and others, to inspect the various units, focusing on numbers, firearms, and horses. It was estimated that over eight thousand of Shi's troops gathered in Linyi, including four to five hundred cavalry. That day, Cao Fulin completed the inspection in the Dezhou area and returned to Yucheng from Linyi on the 13th, before going to Jinan to report on the inspection. On the morning of the 13th, Cao, accompanied by Liu Shuxiang, arrived at the Jinan Railway Station. According to Cao, Shi's army totaled over five thousand men, with over three thousand firearms, and so on.</p>
<p>Shi Yousan's departure from Shandong across the sea is confirmed. According to a Qingdao telegram, Shi Yousan and his entourage arrived in Jiaozhou early on the 12th, transferred to cars to Jiaozhou Bay, and boarded a scheduled Japanese ship to Dalian. Those traveling with him included Zhang Huanan, Ning Xingyuan, and over twenty attendants and adjutants. (August 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Fan Pujiang and Ge Guangting Return to Beijing <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Han Fuju Sends Song Shiyan to Accompany Them</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: During the campaign against Shi Yousan, Fan Pujiang, by order of Zhang Xueliang, traveled between Hebei and Shandong, visiting Jinan three times and Tai'an once, jointly discussing the maintenance of the North China situation with Han Fuju, Ma Hongkui, and others. Now that the military action against Shi has concluded and the reception of defeated soldiers is nearing completion, Fan believed there was no need to remain in Jinan. Therefore, today (the 12th) at 6:40 PM, he and Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, took the No. 202 train to Beijing. Before their departure, the reporter visited Fan at the Jiaoji Hotel, asking about his mission and results in Shandong, as well as his overall impressions. According to Fan, Pujiang was extremely pleased with everything in Shandong. He had visited Jinan three or four times. During his first visit, rumors of Shi Yousan's rebellion were just beginning to circulate, and had not yet erupted. Pujiang met with Chairman Han several times and immediately recognized him as an extremely forthright and straightforward person, clear-headed, not someone easily manipulated without principle. He possessed a strong sense of national interest, selfless, and genuinely prioritized the overall interests of the Party and the nation. Therefore, he dared to conclude that although Han had a deep personal friendship with Shi, if Shi were to deviate, Han would not align with him. Upon returning to Beijing, he reported this to Commander Zhang and informed various important figures in the Northeast. At the time, some did not fully believe Pujiang's words, likely due to Han and Shi's shared past struggles, which caused some doubt. Even when Pujiang returned to Beijing for the second time from Jinan, this point was questioned, but Pujiang absolutely believed in Han's character and deeply valued having him as a friend. Now that the military action against Shi has passed, everything should be self-evident. As for his mission during this visit to Jinan, he feared that Chairman Han might have some misunderstanding regarding the reception of Shi's troops, perhaps thinking that if both the Northeast Army and the Central Army resolved the issue of Shi's troops, such as Shandong incorporating them, it might appear as though they were reaping the benefits. Therefore, Deputy Commander Zhang specially sent Pujiang to explain this point and to express Deputy Commander Zhang's sincere desire for Chairman Han to quickly receive Shi's defeated troops, so that the local areas would be freed from disturbance as soon as possible. The result was exceptionally satisfactory, and Pujiang was deeply grateful for the numerous courtesies extended by Chairman Han during his visits to Jinan. According to Ge Guangting, he had been unable to visit Deputy Commander Zhang since his illness. After his recovery, Guangting telegraphed Beijing, intending to visit, but received a telegram from the Deputy Commander, instructing him to stay in Jinan for a few days, as no one from the Northeast was in Jinan at the time. Later, he received a telegram from Chief of Staff Ji, inviting him to visit Beijing. However, due to the backlog of documents at the Railway Bureau, he returned to Qingdao a few days ago to review and process them. Now that the matter is completed, he is traveling to Beijing with Representative Fan. Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuju, because Deputy Commander Zhang repeatedly sent representatives to Jinan and presented gifts such as flower vases, specially appointed Song Shiyan, head of the Third Route Army Military Education Corps, as his representative to travel to Beijing on the same train with Fan Pujiang and Ge Guangting at 6:40 PM today (the 12th), to express condolences to Deputy Commander Zhang regarding his illness and to convey thanks for the gifts. Song also carries a personal letter from Han to Deputy Commander Zhang, to be presented in person upon arrival in Beijing. Fan, Ge, and others are traveling on a chartered Jiaoji Railway car attached to the Beijing-Pukou train. Before their departure, Jiang Bocheng, Wen Chenglie, Li Zongbi, Li Shuchun, Wang Fangting, Wang Kai, and others arrived at the station to see them off. (August 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e63">Qian Wencan's Remains Being Searched For <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Excavation of Donglu Middle School</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In the immediate aftermath of the May 3rd Incident, Japanese soldiers were stationed throughout Jinan, enforcing special martial law and inspecting Chinese citizens. Qian Wencan, a lineman for the Jinan Telegraph Bureau, was also arrested by Japanese soldiers and taken to the headquarters (i.e., Donglu Middle School). After that, his whereabouts were unknown. Later, it was discovered that he had indeed been brutally murdered by the Japanese, but his body could not be found. Last month, Madame Cai Gongshi came to Jinan and excavated the former Diplomatic Commissioner's Office, discovering a large number of skeletal remains of martyrs who died during the May 3rd Incident. Qian Wencan's wife, Madam Yu Peiyuan, saw reports of this in newspapers in her native Jiangsu and also had the intention of excavating Donglu Middle School to search for his remains. She also obtained the consent of Donglu Middle School Principal Zhu Jinggu. Now, Madam Yu Peiyuan has arrived in Jinan from her hometown and submitted a petition to the Memorial Committee for the May 3rd Martyrs, requesting that they notify Donglu School. The Committee sent Liu Zhongchang to contact the school early yesterday (the 12th) and decided to begin excavation early this morning (the 13th) at 8:00 AM. At the same time, they also sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, requesting them to send police to the site to maintain order. If Qian Wencan's remains are found, his family will transport them back to their hometown for burial. If the remains of others are discovered, the police will properly bury them.</p>
<p>Further news: This morning (the 13th) at 9:00 AM, Madam Qian Yu Peiyuan, accompanied by Qian Wencan's brother Qian Wenjiong, led ten workers to Donglu Middle School to begin excavation. Those participating on-site included Liu Zhongchang, representing the May 3rd Martyrs Association, Wu Jiaoshan, representing the County Party Headquarters, Zhu Jinggu, Principal of Donglu Middle School, Liang Lieya, Director of the Telecommunications Administration Bureau, the chief of the Gold Department of the Yantai-Jinan Telegraph Line, and other colleagues from the Telegraph Bureau. They began excavating the southwest corner of Donglu Middle School. Until the evening, they had found nothing. It is said that they plan to add five more workers tomorrow to speed up the process. According to Madam Qian, the purpose of this visit is that it would be good if they could find Qian's remains, but even if they cannot be identified, she will keep a memorial. She will try to ask the authorities to build a martyr's tomb or memorial to comfort the loyal souls. (August 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e64">Reasons for Japanese Police Withdrawal <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The withdrawal of Japanese police stationed at Majia Post in Changchun has been reported previously. Farmers in the Wanbaoshan area, upon hearing of the withdrawal of Japanese police, were overjoyed and spread the news to each other. Starting on the 9th, they began filling in the water ditches and restoring the farmland to its original state. The main reason for the Japanese police's withdrawal is that Yanai Tsuneo, the Japanese Consul in Liaoning, came north by order of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate the conditions of Korean migrants and the truth of the Wanbaoshan incident. Wherever he went, he saw that Chinese and Korean people were living in peace with each other. However, at Majia Post, he saw that dams were being built, causing the upstream water level to rise and flood much of the farmland. He also saw that the Japanese police were stationed there, with a too-conspicuous presence. Therefore, he immediately ordered a breach to be opened in the river dam to release the upstream water. After investigating, he submitted a written report. Based on his recommendations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wanted to mitigate public anger in China and, on August 2nd, telegraphed the Japanese Consul in Changchun, ordering the withdrawal of the police. Consul Tadai Naoharu was obstinate and refused to withdraw immediately. He was urged by Jilin Consul Ishiya a few days ago, and was finally forced to comply on August 8th. This time, the illegal intrusion of Japanese police into our territory has caused us significant losses. The Japanese police, for their part, have incurred considerable expenses over the past two months, which is entirely their own doing. As for the negotiations between Jilin Consul Ishiya and Zhong Yu, they have been stalled to this day because Ishiya has been avoiding meeting with Zhong, and Zhong has been suffering from heatstroke.

<p>The Canal Water Level Rises Again</p>
<h3 id="e65">Provincial Government Leaders Unanimously Advocate Protecting the Dam <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Conflicts Arise When People Upstream Secretly Open Zhaoguan Dam</p>
<p>Li Mingyang Is Sent to Northern Jiangsu to Supervise County-Level Efforts to Protect Embankments</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The water level of the Jiangsu Canal, which had been stabilizing for days, unexpectedly received a telephone report from the Water Conservancy Bureau yesterday morning stating that the water level at Sangu Gate had risen another two inches on the 14th, with a water depth of two zhang and four chi and two cun. At Yumatou, the water level had risen another three inches on the 14th, with a water depth of one zhang and nine chi and five cun. A dangerous situation had emerged at Huailou Bay in Baoying, and repairs were being carried out overnight. According to a telegram from Yangzhou, County Magistrate Chen of Jiangdu reported to the Superintendent's Office that over two thousand people from upstream were suddenly attempting to secretly open the Zhaoguan Dam, and there were reports of conflicts with people downstream. Upon receiving the report, the Superintendent's Office immediately ordered the 94th Brigade stationed in Yangzhou and Mr. Liang Guanying to cooperate with the county magistrates of Huaiyin and Huaian to persuade and stop them, pending further action from the Provincial Government.</p>
<p>After receiving telegrams from Superintendent Zhang and General Commander Liang reporting that the water level of the Yi River had risen again and the banks of the canal were in extreme danger, the Provincial Government immediately held a meeting and decided to raise the banks of the canal by five chi on both sides, and telegraphed the counties along the canal to hire workers to repair the embankments. Commissioner Li Mingyang was also sent to Northern Jiangsu to supervise the counties to do their best to protect the embankments. Because there were widespread rumors that some people wanted to secretly open the Zhaoguan Dam, Li was specially ordered to dispatch troops to protect it and to instruct the people in the counties to earnestly protect the embankments.</p>
<p>Another report: Three of the dams along the canal leading to the sea have already been opened (Cheluo Dam, Xin Dam, Nanguan Dam), but the water level has not receded significantly. The counties of Huaiyin and Yangzhou have requested that the Zhaoguan Dam be opened as well. However, the bottom channel of the dam has been abandoned, and opening it would cause the water to flood the five counties of Yancheng, Fuyang, Xinghua, Taizhou, and Dongtai. Not only would there be no harvest this year, but there might be no crops to plant in both the upper and lower seasons of next year. Liang Guanying had previously expressed the intention to open the dam, but after receiving telegrams from fellow villagers from various counties explaining the dangers, Liang has now advocated for protecting the embankment. Yesterday, local villagers specially sent someone to Shanghai to meet with Superintendent Zhang Zhijiang, explaining that opening the dam would be harmful and not beneficial. Zhang also understood that the area of the five counties was too large and the losses would be too great, so he also advocated for protecting the dam and promised to immediately telegraph General Commander Liang to send troops to protect the embankment. At the same time, Wang Boling also sent a telegram to Ye Chucang, requesting that the Zhaoguan Dam not be opened. The text of Wang's telegram is as follows: To Chairman Ye and all committee members of the Jiangsu Provincial Government: The Zhaoguan Dam has long been abandoned and must not be opened. Although the Che (Luo), Nan (Guan), and Xin dams have been opened, the water has not decreased. This is due to the obstruction of the ports and gates of the various salt reclamation companies along the coast. Opening the Zhaoguan Dam would only increase the flooded area. Your brothers are well aware of the advantages and disadvantages for this province. I am offering a word for the sake of the people, not daring to suggest a proposal. Wang Boling respectfully begs.</p>
<p>Jiangsu's Second</p>
<h3 id="e66">Provincial Representative Assembly Opened Yesterday <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Preparatory Meeting Held in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 15th) was the opening day of the Second Jiangsu Provincial Representative Assembly. At 8:00 AM, vehicles were crowded in front of the Nanma Road Boxian Park. The military band and the Jiangsu Provincial Boy Scout Training Team arrived at the park to serve. Representatives from various counties, personnel from various agencies and organizations, Provincial Government Chairman Ye, Department Chiefs Hu (Civil Affairs), Xu (Finance), Sun (Construction), Chen (Education), and He (Agriculture) arrived at the meeting one after another. Attending representatives wore red symbols, guests wore green symbols, and assembly staff and provincial reorganization committee members wore yellow symbols. There were about 500 people in total. The meeting began at 9:30 AM, with rituals performed as usual. Chairman Yang Xingquan gave an opening speech, stating that since the second reorganization of Party affairs in the province, everything has been carried out in accordance with the instructions of the Central Government and in accordance with central regulations, so there have been no major errors, but there have also been no great achievements. The Provincial Representative Assembly has two missions: (1) The mission to the Chinese Kuomintang: since the Third National Congress in the 18th year (of the Republic of China), there have been many crises within the Party. Jiangsu is close to the Central Government and should bear a significant mission. Since the Third National Congress in the 18th year, there have been many crises within the Party. Jiangsu is close to the Central Government and should bear a significant mission. Comrades in all counties should unify their wills and work together for the progress of the Party. (2) The mission to the Party in this province: the reason why Party affairs in this province needed a second reorganization was entirely because there were small organizations within the Party, which caused disagreements and led to disputes, which is deeply regrettable. Now, the disputes in various counties have been eliminated and are on track, but since the Provincial Representative Assembly bears a significant mission for Party affairs in the entire province, it cannot harbor any selfish views or allow small organizations to disrupt Party affairs again. He then described the way forward for the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters and the various county Party Headquarters, saying that the life of the new Jiangsu is entirely dependent on the Provincial Representative Assembly. Currently, there are major unresolved foreign affairs issues and major disaster relief needs in various parts of Northern Jiangsu. He hoped that the representatives would carefully discuss solutions and live up to the mission of building a new Jiangsu. Next, Central Supervisor Miao Peicheng gave instructions, saying that today is the opening of the Second Jiangsu Provincial Representative Assembly. He was commissioned by the Central Government to attend the ceremony. At the same time, he was able to gather with representatives from various counties, which can also be said to be a gathering of all Party comrades in Jiangsu, a very rare opportunity. The chairman just reported that the mission of the Representative Assembly is very detailed. He wanted to say a few more words, which is the work of Party members. First, they must go to the countryside and go deep into the people to do work. Second, propaganda should not only make the people understand, but also pay attention to enlightening the people and making them have deep faith. Third, construction must strive to achieve results in all aspects, such as the suffering of the people from today's floods, which means that construction has not reached a truly effective level. Fourth, everyone must have a spirit of sacrifice, so that Party members' words and actions, and practical work, can all gain the sympathy and faith of the people. Next, Ye Chucang gave a speech, saying that the colleagues of the Provincial Government were very honored to participate in the Provincial Representative Assembly and were also greatly encouraged. The success of today's Provincial Representative Assembly is due to the guidance of the Party Committees of various provinces and the efforts of all comrades, a close organization, and continuous progress, which is why there is today's performance. The biggest progress in Party affairs in Jiangsu is that Party Headquarters at all levels have been well established and Party members have been accurately counted. The strength of the Party in the future will be easier to achieve good performance compared to today. However, completing the organization is only the first step. Whether the organization is sound or not depends on the strength it generates after its completion. For example, a table, completing its organization is not the goal, but it is necessary to see how the strength it generates from its use is. The organization of the Party is the same. Now, the Party in the local area cannot be said to have no relationship with the people, but I think there is still a possibility of being more closely related. If all the achievements today are created by central laws and regulations, with laws and regulations, those who work have methods, such as the establishment of agricultural, industrial, commercial, and student groups. This is related to laws and regulations. Comrades from Party Headquarters at all levels must go further and seek to relate their careers to the people, so that they can truly gain the sympathy and faith of the people. Finally, he said that the mission of the Representative Assembly is to review past work, determine future plans, and also to examine past political work and provide future methods. The Provincial Government has a written report on its work over the years. If any comrades still want to invite service personnel from a certain aspect to attend and explain, please notify us. Finally, everyone stood up and shouted slogans, then the music played and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 15th) at 2:00 PM, the assembly held a preparatory meeting, led by Chairman Yang Xingqin to perform rituals as usual, and reported that 146 people had registered for today's preparatory meeting, elected the presidium of the assembly, members of the various special committees, and drew the order of representative seats. After the report, Cao Minghuan, representative of the Credentials Committee, reported that of the 61 counties in Jiangsu, 58 counties, including Zhenjiang, had produced provincial representatives, totaling more than 150 people. Changshu, Yizheng, and Siyang counties had not produced representatives due to election disputes. The Provincial Party Reorganization Committee appointed Hu Puan, Qi Xiyong, Ma Yinbing, Zhang Kaiyang, and Minghuan to conduct the review. It was found that 149 people were qualified. Subsequently, representatives of certain numbers questioned the cancellation of the qualifications of the Baoying representatives. Cao Minghuan explained again, but certain representatives were not satisfied. At that time, the voices of the speakers were quite inconsistent, and the order of the venue was slightly chaotic. The chairman then asked the representatives to stop speaking, saying that today is a preparatory meeting, not a discussion meeting. The crowd was slightly silent, and the election of the presidium began. The results are as follows: The presidium consists of five people. Huang Yuren and Yang Xingqin were appointed by the Provincial Party Reorganization Committee, and the other three were elected by the assembly. Ge Jianshi received 84 votes, Zhang Renjie received 73 votes, Zhu Yunji received 68 votes, and Zhang Minquan received 68 votes. Zhu and Zhang received the same number of votes. After a run-off, Zhang Minquan received more votes and was elected.</p>
<p>Of the 149 delegates who passed the credentials review, there were two women: Liu Yingzhao from Xiaoxian County and Zhao Yuzheng from Dangshan County. Zhao was a former member of the Jiangsu Provincial Women's Association.</p>

Nine rickshaw pullers were arrested by the Brigade Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau. That evening, the Public Security Bureau summoned representatives of the rickshaw pullers to persuade them, and they all resumed work this morning. However, the water level continued to rise by more than three inches today, making it even more difficult for rickshaws to operate in various places. More scaffolding is being built in various places, which has a greater impact on the rickshaw pullers' business.</p>
<p>A large group of bandits has been discovered on the border between Yingshan and Huoqiu counties in Anhui Province. In addition to the 53rd Division, which has been ordered to go and intercept them, Provincial Government Chairman Chen Tiaoyuan has also ordered troops from the 46th Division stationed in Liuan to send a regiment to suppress them.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Chief Zhao Jingshi convened a joint meeting of various agencies yesterday to conduct a grain registration.

<p>The case of the stolen goods at Tianmashan was solved. Yang Shijie, inspector of the Public Security Bureau, noticed two suspicious individuals in a small restaurant in the Cangqiao area this morning (the 15th). They had bundles on their backs and were eating. He stepped forward to question them and learned that one was Zhou Chunshan from Shandong, and the other was Tang Asi from Datuan. They admitted to stealing from a family whose name was unknown in the Tianmashan area.

He immediately took them to the bureau for interrogation and detention pending investigation and handling.</p>
<p>Two More Robberies Occur Outside the South Gate. A robbery occurred in Changlou, outside the South Gate, last month, but the stolen goods and robbers have not been found. Unexpectedly, the home of a farmer named Zhou in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Tutu area was attacked by multiple bandits late on the fourteenth night. The victim was awakened from his sleep to find the robbers ransacking the room. They forced him to reveal the location of his hidden silver, but he refused, leading to him being beaten and injured. As a result, twenty yuan in silver dollars were robbed before the bandits escaped. At the same time, the home of a farmer named Wang in a neighboring village was also robbed, with forty-seven yuan in silver dollars being taken. The victims separately requested the Public Security Bureau and the County Court to arrest the bandits and recover the stolen goods this morning.</p>

<p>Interception of Smuggled Opium Leads to the Drowning of a Patrol Officer. Fang Yi, the district chief of the Eleventh District, received a confidential report stating that there were suspicious boats, one large and one small, in the Xili area of Songjia Kan Town. The report requested a team be dispatched to inspect the boats. The district chief, upon receiving the report, together with the newly appointed patrol officer Zhang Xue, ordered four policemen to conduct an inspection. They found that the boat owner was Wang Changsheng and three others including Chen Qiaofu were on the boat. The small boat was a fishing boat, and the large boat had a cabin. Upon detailed interrogation, it was revealed that the boat was transporting 54 packages of opium belonging to Chen Liankui from Shanghai. The opium was hidden in the nearby residence of a Zhou family. The district chief and the patrol officer then led the original police team, guided by Chen and others, to investigate. Upon reaching the Zhou family's residence, suddenly</p>

Just as they were about to continue their investigation, gunshots rang out. At that time, the district chief, the deputy district leader Jin Qiancheng, were surrounded by villagers. Patrol officer Zhang was shocked and fled. After the incident, he was nowhere to be found. The district chief then led the police to escort the two smugglers back to the district by boat with the contraband. The district chief first supervised the guards to escort the people and contraband to the county government for investigation. The next morning, the body of the patrol officer was found in the river behind the Zhou family's house. It is reported that the county government has appointed Shen Jinghua, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to supervise the inspection.</p>

<p>Opposition to Telephone Rate Increase. The telephones used by the Kunshan Telephone Company are mostly old, resulting in unclear pronunciation and difficult operators, causing users to complain. Previously, after a party-government meeting, a letter was sent to the county government, ordering the Construction Bureau to give the company a serious warning. However, no improvements have been seen to date. Instead, the company added a half-yuan monthly fee when collecting payments the day before yesterday. The users, arguing that the company had not notified them in advance and had unilaterally increased the fee, rose up in opposition. Chen Jiangang and others sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce, requesting the company to cancel the price increase and reorganize internally. Otherwise, they will unanimously refuse to pay the monthly fee.</p>

All users are now following the association's proposal, resolutely refusing to pay electricity bills temporarily.</p>
<p>Ancient Sutra and Pagoda Map Discovered in the Ruined Pagoda of Meili. Meili Town, located sixteen miles east of the city in this county, is the leading town in the eastern countryside, exceptionally lively. There is a Dongta Temple in the east of the town. There was originally a Jusha Pagoda, which was about five to six zhang tall, built during the Song Dynasty. Later, due to years of disrepair, the temple fell into disuse, leaving only an open space of more than ten mu. The pagoda still stood alone in the middle, but it also showed signs of collapsing. Previously, people discovered several pages of the Diamond Sutra and a pagoda map, rolled up inside the bricks and tiles. The abbot of the temple, Yaozong, took custody of them. The district office (under the Meitang District) learned of the matter, put it on the meeting agenda, and sent someone to retrieve the items from the abbot to preserve the historical sites. However, it is said that the sutras and pagoda map were taken away by a Zhang, who hired someone to repair and bind them for safekeeping. Now, the district chief believes that the map and sutra were left from the Song Dynasty and are extremely rare treasures. He will negotiate with Zhang to hand them over.</p>
<p>Notorious Bandit Zheng Ming Has Been Sent to the County for Trial. The notorious bandit Zheng Ming is from Jiangbei. He grew up in Wangshi Town, Changshu, and followed his father, Zheng Yushan, in a life of banditry. He was arrested in Shanghai earlier this month. The detective team of this county's Public Security Bureau went to Shanghai to bring him back. On the twelfth, he was transferred from the Public Security Bureau to the county government. After a secret interrogation by Judge Chai, the bandit Zheng spoke generously, admitting that certain cases were done by him and his gang, while others were not, showing no fear. Knowing that he would not escape death, he asked the officials to write a letter to his mother before his execution by firing squad. He requested that his father's coffin also be transported back to Pu for burial. He had no other requests. He was then placed in heavy shackles and imprisoned, singing freely without any fear. It is said that Zheng Ming was extremely fierce since he was young. When he was eleven years old, he went to Hubei for some matter and hired a mule to travel to the station. The mule driver demanded payment, but Zheng had no money. He tricked the mule driver into going to the wilderness, where he stabbed the mule driver to death with a sharp knife. The villagers raised an alarm and gathered a crowd to surround and arrest Zheng, who was sentenced to six years in prison. Later, he was released during the general amnesty of the Beijing government in the tenth year. From this, one can see the extent of his cruelty.</p>

Later, due to the difficulty in recovering debts owed by various households, a petition was specially submitted to the County Court for prosecution. After interrogation by President Yang of the court, it was revealed that there were as many as 172 households in Dangkou Town alone that owed money, and the total amount owed was only several hundred yuan. Recently, President Yang issued summons to the debtor households to come to the court for interrogation and recovery of the debts. Each summons charged a service fee of three yuan and five cents, totaling 524 yuan and six cents. The debtor households complained that some owed only one yuan or two or three yuan, and some had already paid off their debts but were still summoned to pay the service fee. They all complained to District Chief Yu Shangshu, requesting him to find a way to help. After District Chief Yu personally investigated, everyone said that the bailiffs of the court ordered them to raise and pay the service fee. If they did not comply, they would be sent to the Public Security Bureau for detention. As a result, public resentment was boiling. Dangkou and the court are only forty-five li apart, and the bailiffs can get more than 520 yuan in fees in one or two days, which is too much. The people cannot afford it. Yesterday, a letter was sent to President Yang, asking him to find a way to help and maintain the people's strength.</p>
<p>The First District Requests to Stabilize Rice Prices. Qian Zhongliang, the district chief of the First District, stated that this year's continuous rain has damaged the crops, causing rice prices to soar. Recently, one dan of white rice has risen to more than fourteen yuan. However, it is found that there is still a lot of rice stored in Wuxi. If hoarding can be prohibited and exports are stopped, rice prices will definitely be stabilized. Yesterday, he submitted a petition to the county government, requesting to reiterate the ban, strictly prevent hoarding, and convene rice merchants to suppress rice prices, and not allow them to raise prices and hoard, in order to maintain the people's food and stabilize people's hearts.</p>
<p>Vehicle Patrol Team Arrests a Bandit. Wang Wei, the captain of the County Police Brigade, ordered Huang Xiaoming, the leader of the vehicle patrol team, to lead patrol officer Zhang Guanghan, deputy squad leader Zhang Duoshan, and more than ten team members to patrol the countryside in vehicles the day before yesterday. While patrolling near Dongfeng, Xulei Bridge in the Third District (Yangming Township) outside the South Gate, they spotted three suspicious people sitting in a pavilion. They immediately stepped forward to question them. When the three people saw the police team, they ran away and fired their guns, fortunately without injuring anyone. Team leader Huang and others chased after them and arrested one person. The other two escaped. They also seized a rattan bag, a four-inch white Langlin pistol, five bullets, and clothing. They were all taken to the city for questioning. After interrogation, the arrested bandit claimed his name was Gu Gensheng, from Changzhou. He usually resides at his uncle's house in Yangshuyuan. The rest of his answers were vague. Yesterday, he was escorted to the brigade headquarters and transferred to the county government for handling.</p>
<p>Lake Water Backflows, Crops Are Hopeless. After the sunny days at the beginning of the month, the farmers tried to save the crops in the fields that had not been flooded, and it was expected to be effective. Until recently, the counties north of the Yangtze River have suffered floods, so the river water has not receded for days, and sometimes it has even increased. As of yesterday, the river water had receded by about eight inches. Because the river water did not recede, the effect of draining the fields was limited. The farmers were extremely anxious, so there was no certainty about the harvest.</p>
<p>Letter Requesting the Establishment of an Emergency Relief Association. The colleagues of the box office of the Gongyu Society at the railway station, in view of the major floods everywhere since the beginning of summer, where fields were washed away and cries of misery were everywhere, planned to gather all colleagues, sacrifice their image, and use all the funds raised from the sale of tickets for disaster relief. However, acting alone was of limited ability, and the funds raised were insufficient. Yesterday, a public letter was sent to the county party headquarters, requesting it to convene local organs and organizations to jointly organize and raise funds for emergency relief. The letter also requested that a location and date be designated to perform Peking opera for several days to raise funds for emergency relief.</p>

<p>The River Water in Yangzhou Suddenly Rose by About a Foot. Although the Grand Canal dike is under tension, the Zhaoguan Dam will not be opened for the time being. Various parties in the province and government advocate protecting the dike. The details were reported earlier. It is now learned that the people upstream and downstream have a rumor that the Zhaoguan Dam will be opened on a certain day. Therefore, thousands of people gathered to protect the dike. On the thirteenth and fourteenth nights, many people rushed to the dike, and the lights were as bright as day. Jiangdu upstream rose two inches on the fourteenth, still recovering the water level of two feet and four inches. Downstream, when the afternoon tide arrived, the Grand Canal outside Dongguan, Quekou, Chaoguan, Fuyun, and Xunningmen, etc., around the city, suddenly rose by about a foot, and the water flooded into the city more deeply. On the thirteenth, the boats traveling between Yangzhou and Zhenjiang could go straight through the Baota Gate south of the city without detouring the three bends because of the high water level. On the afternoon of the fourteenth, the water in Slender West Lake suddenly became turbid, from east to west. Those who wanted to go to Tianningmen by small boat north of the city were blocked by the turbidity. The sidewalk on Lower Buying and Selling Street was submerged past the knees. According to a message from the Construction Bureau on the fourteenth, the Zixi dikes of Shaobo (about eight li) have already been built, but the dikes will lose effect again due to the high water level. Xu Mingdi, the technology section chief of the Construction Bureau stationed in the town, and section member Wang Ruisheng, added three feet of zixi dikes to the area from the Nandawang Temple to the Beiban Factory, which will be completed soon. A special report was submitted to the bureau and the county, requesting to send personnel to inspect and accept the dikes on the sixteenth. Chen County Chief and Zhang Zuan, the director of the Construction Bureau, personally went to Yangzi Bridge to investigate both banks. Because that place is the main road to the Yangtze River, the banks are in a very critical situation. It is planned to carry out rescue work.</p>

<p>Young Man Commits Suicide by Poisoning Due to an Affair. On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, at 2:00 PM, a young man from Shanghai, Du Hongchun, 26 years old and from Haining, booked room 80 at the Hangzhou Hotel on Hubin Road. He immediately called the tea boy to get a pen and write two letters. He went out once at 5:00 PM and went to Pishi Lane after dinner. He returned to the hotel at 9:30 PM, closed the door, and went to bed. At 2:00 AM today (the 15th), the tea boy passed by the door and saw that the guest had not gotten up. He pushed the door open and entered, seeing that the guest's face was pale and his mind was confused. On the table, there was an empty bottle of sleeping pills and a small empty box of opium. Knowing that he had taken poison, he urgently called the police station to send police to Hangzhou Hospital for treatment. After twenty emergency injections, there was still no improvement by 4:00 PM in the afternoon. His life was feared to be difficult to save. One of the suicide notes requested the court to waive the autopsy. It stated that he worked for the telephone bureau in Shanghai and other places. Two years ago, he returned to his hometown and met a young woman. Their love was very good. This year, they were discovered by a neighbor and suffered a major shock. He bought the sleeping pills and opium in Shanghai. He heard that the woman was in Hangzhou, so he could not bear to leave her and came here to commit suicide.</p>
<p>The Provincial Committee Secretly Investigates Rice Smuggling. After merchants from other provinces purchased rice in large quantities in Xiashi, Pinghu, and other places in Zhejiang Province, the price of rice in Hangzhou soared by nearly two yuan in three days.

<p>The People of the Entire County Oppose Increased Taxes. The surcharges and taxes on Yuhang's land tax are almost twice the amount of the regular tax. The people have suffered from consecutive years of disasters and famines and are impoverished. In May of this year, the education community took advantage of the expiration of the three-year limit for the grain accumulation fund and continued to collect funds for the righteous education grain accumulation. The grain accumulation was collected at a rate of four cents of ocean per mu of land, which was still not satisfactory. Therefore, the land and mountains were included as a whole and collected at a rate of five cents of ocean per mu. The righteous education received four cents, and the grain accumulation received one cent. The education director Cheng Feng and others submitted a request to the county government for approval and transfer. County Magistrate Feng Shifan only invited the education community and held a meeting at the government office. He then used the name of approval by the various legal groups to submit the request to the higher authorities for approval. After the procedures were completed, the collection was announced. Upon hearing this, the people of the entire county were shocked. The sixty villages and eighty-six communities in the six districts of the county, the county farmers' association, and the people all submitted requests to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the three ministries of finance, civil affairs, and education, requesting the original plan be withdrawn. The provincial government approved the request and ordered the three ministries to discuss and respond to it. The people waited for a month but there was no indication. They then elected representatives to go to the province to petition. On the morning of the fourteenth, the representatives went to the provincial government to request an audience. Secretary Lou Jin Jian received them. The representatives presented the facts that County Magistrate Feng and others had deceived their superiors and forged public opinion. Secretary Lou recognized that the representatives' request was justified and agreed to submit it to the Provincial Government Committee for reconsideration. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Devoe Defeats Opponent with Ease <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Devoe (Canada) (6|2 6|4 6|1) Smith (USA)</p>
<p>Devoe came from Canada this year and is one of their famous players. He has long arms, a comfortable grip, and is good at doubles and singles. Yesterday, he met Smith, and struck out easily, breaking the enemy's line with ease. The first set was 6-2, and the victory and defeat passed in a flash. In the second set, Smith's offense and defense improved, and he showed some resistance, but he could not hold on for long. After 4-4, he saw a downward trend again and soon lost again with 4-6. In the third set, Devoe's long arms waved left and right, and he was invincible. Smith lost all his fighting power and almost didn't know what to do. He won back a game, avoiding being blanked, which was a great blessing in misfortune. As a result, Devoe won a big victory with 6-1.</p>

<p>Ritt (Canada) (3|6 6|4 2|6 6|3 6|2) Squires (USA)</p>
<p>Of the four singles matches on the day, the most intense was Ritt vs. Squires. The number of wins and losses for both players was fiercely contested in every point, every game, and every set. However, Ritt's final victory in the fifth set relied on his strong divine power. Initially, Squires won the first set 6-3. Then Ritt fought back and won the second set 6-4. Squires then won the third set 6-2, taking the lead. Ritt then won the fourth set 6-3, creating a tie. After four sets, Squires' face was pale, and his arm strength was greatly reduced. Ritt took advantage of the momentum and advanced rapidly, dominating the situation. In comparison, the difference between the two became apparent. Before long, Ritt won the fifth set 6-2.</p>

<p>Hyotare (Japan) (6|3 1|6 6|2) Tuck (England)</p>
<p>Hyotare is worthy of being a famous singles player, breaking through three barriers in a row and defeating Tuck, a veteran of England. In the first set, the two closely followed each other, resisting each other. Hyotare was good at using arm strength and succeeded in everything he wanted. Tuck relied on his experience and advanced whenever he had the chance. After 2-2, Hyotare specialized in attacking the opponent's weaknesses, and Tuck could not correct them, losing two games in a row. It seemed that there was a turning point under the hard counterattack, but unexpectedly the net shot lost its balance, either committing suicide in front of the net or hitting wildly outside the shallow area. With a long sigh, he failed with 3-6. In the second set, Hyotare's victory was due to his superb artistry, but Tuck's repeated suicides and inaccurate angles also indirectly contributed to his victory. As a result, 6-1. In the third set, Tuck seemed to feel powerless, and Hyotare's smashes were fierce, like a hurricane, making people shudder. He won five games in a row. Tuck fought like a trapped beast, showing all his skills as much as possible, winning back two games, and making some progress. Hyotare was deeply afraid of losing his success and worked hard, finally winning again with 6-2.</p>

<p>Wheat (England) (6|3 6|1 6|4) Machida (Japan)</p>
<p>Veteran Wheat has been a hero at sea for many years. When his reputation was at its peak, today's good players were probably still learning to hold the racket and serve the ball. Time flies, but Wheat, although old, is still serving his motherland. He played yesterday, and his power remained. The agile and lively Machida ran under his control, relying on others' breath, and sighed that he was inferior. In the first set, each used the serve to gain momentum alternately. Until each had two, Machida's weaknesses were fully revealed. The old general seized the opportunity to attack, and he didn't miss one in a hundred. He turned around and won with 6-3. In the second set, Machida was too depressed. Except for winning in the fifth game, he failed in one game after another, and finally lost badly with 1-6. In the middle of the third set, Wheat showed signs of fatigue. Machida took advantage of this to go straight up, holding an advantage of 4-2. How could the old general Wheat be willing to fall behind? His spirit was refreshed, and his muscle strength was restored. He won four games in a row, turning defeat into victory, creating a result of 6-4.</p>

<p>England and Japan were evenly matched yesterday, each winning one group. The victory or defeat of the overall situation depends on today's doubles. Tomorrow, the singles will have two groups, and England and Japan each have the certainty of winning one group (Tuck will definitely lose to Machida, and Hyotare can beat Wheat). The Japanese doubles players are Hyotare and Machida, and the English players are Tuck and Mactot. Doubles emphasizes cooperation, and the Japanese side has the upper hand in this.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Resolved by Signing Yesterday <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Bureau Prepared to Pay 275,000 Taels to Purchase</p>
<p>Secretary Bao Published Detailed Account of the Incident Yesterday</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports: The case of the dispute between the China Merchants Bureau and the French Catholic Church's Sande Hall over the foundation of Jinliyuan Wharf No. 69 has gone through procedures such as lawsuits, mediation, adjudication, and negotiations for a year and a half. The opinions of the two parties differed, making it difficult to resolve. It was not until recently, when Commissioner Guo of the Bureau continued to handle the matter, that they gradually approached an agreement. Yesterday morning, they officially signed a resolution. Sande Hall was willing to sell the land to the Bureau for 275,000 taels, and the Bureau immediately paid the full amount and completed the handover. The eighteen-month-long case has been resolved at once, which is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Mr. Bao Gongfan, Secretary of the China Merchants Bureau, yesterday told a reporter from the Huadong News Agency about the beginning and end of the case. The content of the dispute was that both sides had foundations, both rented by the China Merchants Bureau. One side built a warehouse to store goods, and the other was the Jinliyuan Wharf. The section in the middle, where Warehouse No. 21 was built, was of great importance to the entire wharf. Therefore, when the issue of tax increases arose during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, the Minister of Beiyang and the Shanghai Daotai made every effort to insist on negotiations. Although they were ultimately forced to yield after more than eight years, and land rights were seized, they were fortunately able to secure the condition that it would not hinder the Bureau's shipping operations, so the Bureau was able to continue renting the land. Unexpectedly, in October of the eighteenth year, the China Merchants Bureau exceeded the deadline for paying the winter rent by four days. Although the Bureau later paid the amount with interest calculated on a daily basis, Sande Hall announced the termination of the lease contract on this basis, and in December of that year, filed a lawsuit in the French Concession's Joint Court to terminate the contract. On January 7 of the nineteenth year, the judgment was in favor of the termination of the contract. The Bureau was forced to apply for a retrial. In May, the retrial also failed. However, the valuation of the buildings on the ground was allowed to be determined by appraisers appointed by both parties. The two lawsuits thus resulted in losses. In August, when Cai Pei, Director of the Navigation Affairs Department of the Ministry of Communications, concurrently served as the General Manager of the Bureau, in view of the urgency of the case, realized that if it was not resolved, the adjudication period would expire in an instant, and the Joint Court would inevitably execute the judgment. He began to adopt mediation methods, with the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai and the French Consul-General acting as mediators. One side tried to postpone the execution period, while negotiating back and forth. The newly appointed Commissioner Li Zhonggong took over the matter in September and continued to mediate according to the procedure. After several negotiations, the church side agreed to sell the wharf portion of the land to the Bureau for 390,000 taels. However, because the numbers were too far apart, it was impossible to compromise. The arbitrators appointed by both parties also had different views, and no results could be obtained. After such twists and turns, the matter was delayed for several months, and there was still no concrete solution until the spring of this year. Since Commissioner Guo took office, he has directly met and negotiated with Father Xiaqi of Sande Hall. Father Xiaqi initially held out for a high price and refused to sell easily. Later, after Guo's multiple negotiations, Father Xiaqi was finally able to comply, and the land was sold for a price of 275,000 taels. The Bureau has paid the money and formally completed the handover. The year-long case has been resolved at once, allowing land rights that had been lost to foreigners for decades to be returned to their original owner. This is also a cause for celebration.</p>

<p>Returning to Peiping after the Funeral of Mother Song</p>
<p>Ms. Yu Fengzhi, wife of Deputy Commander Zhang, arrived in Shanghai from Peiping on behalf of Deputy Commander Zhang to pay respects to the funeral of Mother Song, Mrs. Ni. She arrived by train at 4:50 p.m. yesterday. Those who came with her included Shen Nengyi, Director of the Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance of Peiping, Mr. and Mrs. Xu Tonghai, Advisor to the Peiping Municipal Government, and more than a dozen adjutants, bodyguards, and servants. The Railway Bureau specially prepared a flower car, attached to the special express train, which departed from Beijing at 10:00 a.m. yesterday and arrived at the North Station on time without delay. The station area and the platform were filled with military police with guns and live ammunition, and security was extremely tight. Traffic was temporarily cut off when the train entered the station. The military band of the Garrison Command and the Public Security Bureau went to the station to play music. Those who went to the station to welcome her yesterday included Mayor Zhang and his wife, Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghaiguan Customs, Zhou Xiangxian, Secretary of the Headquarters, Guo Chengen, Directors of the two Railway Bureaus, Chen Xizeng, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Jiang Yi, Adjutant of the Garrison Command, and many staff members of the Song residence's funeral arrangement office. After getting off the train, Ms. Yu Fengzhi, accompanied by Mrs. Mayor Zhang, walked out of the platform under strict protection and took the No. 9228 car prepared by the Municipal Government and went straight to the inner courtyard of the Jianghaiguan Supervisory Office on Xinzha Road to rest. This was specially prepared by the Song residence's funeral arrangement office in advance, and the food and lodging were more comfortable. Ms. Yu stayed there yesterday. As for the staff, they stayed at the Cangzhou Hotel, where the funeral arrangement office also set aside ten rooms to provide accommodation. According to sources close to Ms. Yu, she came here specifically to pay respects to the funeral, and will return to Peiping after the funeral of Mrs. Song. When Ms. Yu got off the train yesterday, she wore a dark blue floral gauze cheongsam, lightly applied makeup, and her face was radiant. When she walked out of the platform, she chatted and laughed with Mrs. Mayor Zhang along the way, and nodded to the welcomers to express her gratitude. After arriving at the Jianghaiguan Supervisory Office, Ms. Yu rested for a while and went to the Song residence on Seymour Road to meet Mrs. Chiang Song Meiling and others, and paid respects to Mother Song's coffin as required. She left after talking for half an hour.</p>

<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Requests</p>
<h3 id="e122">Opinions on Revising the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to various trade guilds, stating: "We are writing to inform you that on the 13th of this month, we received a letter from the Committee for Studying the Sino-Japanese Agreed Tariff Rates. It stated that the tariff rates stipulated in the Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Tariff Agreement are still significantly disparate and that the agreement is about to expire and should be revised urgently. The National Products Preservation Association and other organizations convened a joint meeting of various groups and organized the Committee for Studying the Sino-Japanese Agreed Tariff Rates, which held its inaugural meeting on August 5th. At the first committee meeting, it was decided to request the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to send a circular to various trade guilds to solicit their opinions on the revisions that should be made to the Sino-Japanese Agreed Tariff Rates. This would allow for research and review before submitting them to the Ministry for adoption. Upon investigation, this Sino-Japanese reciprocal tariff agreement has been in effect since May 16, 1930. The agreement period is divided into two types. One is a one-year term, which refers to Japanese general merchandise such as fragrant mushrooms, enameled washbasins, enameled ironware, buttons, cloth umbrellas, mirrors, boots, shoes, clocks, watches, hats, medicines, automatic thermostats, suitcases, briefcases, satchels, business card cases, various travel suitcases and boxes, vehicles, and bicycles. The validity of this agreement expired on May 16, 1931. Our business community did not request the government to pay attention to the revision, which was a missed opportunity. The other type, including cotton goods, fish, seafood, etc., has a three-year term and can only be revised on May 16, 1933. The "expiration is imminent, urgently needs to be revised" mentioned by the research committee refers to this three-year term. In summary, regarding the reciprocal items between the two countries, Japan gains 63 types, including 33 types of cotton products, 12 types of seafood, and 17 types of wheat flour and sundries, while China only gains 3 types: summer cloth, silk fabrics, and handmade embroidery. In terms of the reciprocal tariff rates, the majority of China's items maintain the import tariff rates of 1929, and only a few can increase by 2.5%. Therefore, the impact of the so-called new tax (i.e., the tariff rate implemented from January 1, 1931) on Japan is not significant. On the other hand, Japan does not reduce the tariff rates on China's imported summer cloth and embroidery. The tariff on silk fabrics is reduced from 100% to 70%, but its effectiveness is also very minor. Therefore, it is called reciprocal in name, but in reality, it is one-sided. This time, when the committee collects opinions, various industries should pay attention to the following two matters: (1) They must select products or semi-finished products that have a history of sales or potential for sales in Japan. As for the raw materials needed by Japan, the tax is inherently light for the sake of protecting Japanese industries, so there is no need to propose them on our own. (2) For Japanese products that have the potential to severely compete with China's emerging industries, a detailed investigation should be conducted on the relationship between the benefits and harms of both parties. The reciprocal tariff rates should be abolished, or like Japan's treatment of our silk fabrics, a maximum tariff rate should be set, and then slightly reduced. The above-mentioned situation is to prevent various industries from not being fully aware of the details and interests of the Sino-Japanese reciprocal agreement. Therefore, a brief summary is provided for reference during research. If there are any brilliant ideas, please send them to the association for forwarding."</p>

<p>Telegrams to the National Government and President Dai</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news that Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, had resigned to take responsibility, Shanghai leaders such as Yu Hede sent two telegrams yesterday urging him to stay. (1) Telegram to the National Government: "To the Nanjing National Government, President Yu, Secretary-General Ye, and Commissioner Ding. It is reported that President Dai has requested severe punishment for himself to demonstrate impartiality due to errors in the examination calculation, which was a fault of the officials. This serves as an example. With the country facing numerous challenges and relying on thorough planning, please do not allow him to resign abruptly to overcome the difficulties together. We respectfully implore you. Yu Hede, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhen, et al." (abridged). (2) Telegram to President Dai: "To President Dai of the Examination Yuan in the capital. It is reported that Your Excellency has requested dismissal due to errors in the examination calculation. It is a fault of the officials, and Your Excellency has requested severe punishment to demonstrate impartiality, which is admired by all. With the country facing numerous challenges and relying on thorough planning, we respectfully request that you do not resign abruptly to overcome the difficulties together and to appease the public's expectations.

<p>Partial Exemption for Tenants from This Autumn</p>
<p>The municipal government levies house tax. For those whose monthly rent is less than one yuan or quarterly rent is less than three jiao, they are mostly poor laborers with insufficient income to support their families. The Finance Bureau was previously instructed to grant exemptions to show compassion. Recently, the municipal government, in order to show extra compassion for poor households, will, starting from this autumn, exempt the tenant's portion of the house tax for households in the city whose rent is less than three yuan per month or whose quarterly rent is less than nine jiao, except for the owner's portion, which will be collected according to regulations. However, the outstanding taxes from previous quarters will still be urged by the Finance Bureau to collect in a harmonious manner to conclude the matter.</p>

<p>Persuaded to Stay by the Central Government</p>
<p>The newly elected third session of the Executive and Supervisory Committee members of the Municipal Party Committee will take office at 10 am on the 25th after a discussion and meeting. A reporter from Xinsheng News visited Pan Gongzhan and Wang Yansong yesterday to inquire whether they had canceled their resignations, as they had previously submitted their resignations to the Central Government due to being overburdened. According to the results of the interview, Pan Gongzhan's resignation was indeed due to the heavy workload of the Bureau of Social Affairs, which he feared would be difficult to manage concurrently. After submitting his resignation, he was earnestly persuaded to stay by the Central Government. As for Wang Yansong, he wished to use his spare time from running a business to recuperate due to his poor health. However, he was charged with a great duty by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and various trade guilds, and he was also persuaded by the Central Government not to resign. He had no choice but to reluctantly agree. However, Wang Yansong stated that he would not serve as a standing committee member under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Kidnapping and Robbery Case</p>
<h3 id="e126">Universal Indignation <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Declaration Published</p>
<p>First District Party Department: The First District Party Department of this city has issued a declaration regarding the Japanese soldiers' robbery of inferior goods and kidnapping of Chinese citizens within our national territory. It states: "Since the Japanese imperialists exposed their ferocity and created the unprecedented Wanbaoshan Massacre, they have aroused public outrage throughout the country, leading to a unanimous and spontaneous boycott of Japanese goods and the implementation of economic severance. This action is purely a manifestation of the patriotic sentiments of the people, hoping for their repentance. Unfortunately, this has resulted in their malicious collusion with unscrupulous merchants. On the morning of the 13th of this month, the Japanese Naval Office ordered the Anzhai warship stationed in Shanghai to send armed soldiers to invade the mainland, rob Japanese goods, and kidnap many investigators from the Anti-Japanese Association. This act of barbarism and violence is extremely overbearing. If this is allowed to happen, what else is not? Do the Japanese have any respect for our people? The country is in grave danger. All our people must rise up together, fight the fierce enemy to the end, and strive for the final victory. Survival and death are at stake. Compatriots across the country, please wake up quickly. However, the occurrence of this unfortunate incident is caused by the greed for petty profits of unscrupulous merchants. As the saying goes, 'Things must rot from within before insects can grow.' Therefore, the association dares to offer a humble opinion. The whole country should actively promote domestic goods and ensure that everyone does not covet cheapness and everyone refuses to use Japanese goods. If Japanese goods cannot resist domestic production, we hope that all sectors will unanimously advocate for this. We are deeply fortunate. This is our declaration."</p>
<p>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce: The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a declaration yesterday regarding the kidnapping of people by Japanese soldiers in the Huangpu River. It states: "Japan's disregard for China's sovereignty and its use of its naval and military power to act freely in our country has become a common practice. Such examples are too numerous to count. The most prominent examples are the Jinan May 30th Incident and the recent Wanbaoshan Incident. According to international practice, such actions can only be applied to conquered or occupied territories. This shows that the Japanese have long ceased to recognize China as an independent and autonomous country. The so-called envoys and consuls in China are merely appendages of their warlords, tools for deception. Otherwise, if the two countries have diplomatic officials, why not use diplomatic procedures to resolve matters and instead resort to force and free action? This contradictory phenomenon is unprecedented in modern countries. The Wanbaoshan Incident, which has recently caused a great uproar, what is the reason? The Japanese should already know everything. Yet, suddenly, in the complete and intact territorial waters of China's Huangpu River, there is an unlawful arrest of four Chinese citizens by Japanese soldiers. This shows that Japan's policy towards China has not changed and there is no sincerity in repenting. From this, we can draw two conclusions: (1) Our citizens should have a clearer understanding of Japan and further strengthen their spirit of perseverance. (2) It proves that the Japanese have recognized that our people's movement has an irresistible force. Therefore, they have resorted to this desperate and perverse means. In this situation, we can only continue to strive peacefully to achieve the final victory. This is our declaration."</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association Telephones the Whole Country</p>
<h3 id="e127">Unite and Organize <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Achieve Interconnected Effectiveness</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese and Overseas Chinese Aid Committee issued two telegrams yesterday, urging all parts of the country to unite and organize anti-Japanese and overseas Chinese aid groups. The original telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram 1: "To Party Departments and Chambers of Commerce in various regions: Since the establishment of this association in July, we have been working for three weeks. However, the resistance movement triggered by the massacre of overseas Chinese by the Japanese is a manifestation of the entire Chinese nation's self-awareness. Therefore, all parts of the country should unite and organize anti-Japanese and overseas Chinese aid associations to achieve interconnected effectiveness and avoid neglecting one thing for another. We hereby send this telegram, hoping for your acceptance. Sincerely, The Shanghai Anti-Japanese and Overseas Chinese Aid Committee."</p>
<p>Telegram 2: "To all newspapers, Party Departments, and mass organizations: The recent massacre of Chinese in Korea is clearly an organized and planned massacre of Chinese by Japanese imperialists. It is also an unprecedented tragedy in the international community. The shocking news has aroused public outrage. Since we have failed to urge the government to prevent the tragedy beforehand, how can we bear to be timid and not call for action afterward? Therefore, based on the spirit of shared hatred, we have launched an anti-Japanese and overseas Chinese aid movement. We have not only announced the atrocities of the Japanese to the world but also rigorously implemented economic severance with Japan, hoping to kill it. The righteous banner points, and the enemy's courage is cold. However, although there are many who swear to heaven and earth and respond throughout the country, there are still many who hesitate and seek comfort, and have not advanced to an organized struggle. Shanghai, as the economic center of China, rigorously implements anti-Japanese activities, which is enough to cut off the passage of Japanese goods. However, although a single call is enough to shock the world, success in saving the country still depends on the concerted efforts of the entire country. Moreover, the enemy is stubborn, and negotiations have frequently stalled. After the robbery, the country is shocked, and the overseas Chinese are even more in dire straits. Anyone with conscience will be outraged. No heart is of wood or stone, how can they be willing to give up? We hope to catch up quickly, carry out organized actions, and fight for anti-Japanese and overseas Chinese aid, so that a cavity of enthusiasm can bloom the flower of saving the country, and the grief of the country can wash away the humiliation of the overseas Chinese. Looking at the wind and weeping, not expressing all the words, the country is in danger, and we all pray for action. Sincerely, The Shanghai Anti-Japanese and Overseas Chinese Aid Committee."</p>
<h3 id="e128">A Banquet-Style Discussion on Boycotting Japanese Goods <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Exchanging Opinions on Anti-Japanese and Overseas Chinese Aid</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Ye Huijun, Wang Yansong, Yuan Ludeng, and Xu Jilu hosted a public banquet for leaders of various industries at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce the night before last. More than 100 people attended, including Lu Feibohong, Lu Fengzhu, Lu Wenyun, and Lu Qisheng. Chairman Wang Xiaolai said that the invitation to everyone tonight is not a formal meeting, but a banquet-style exchange of opinions on anti-Japanese and overseas Chinese aid. Yu Qiaqing is a veteran of the business community and was invited to express his views first. Yu said that boycotting Japanese goods must be sustained and not be… timely. Only by having goods to boycott can we control others. For example, fine yarn, etc., our country does not yet have this product and cannot but purchase it from them. Therefore, for raw material necessities, we can only endure the pain and purchase them for the time being. On the one hand, we collect national salvation funds to prepare factories for manufacturing raw materials. Only considering the present and not the future is not a permanent solution. In short, when boycotting Japanese goods, we must also consider the livelihood of domestic workers. Matters that cause international negotiations should be avoided. Various industries should encourage each other to inspire their conscience and not sell Japanese goods. Because our country's tariffs are not completely autonomous, preventing foreign goods is very difficult. Today, we invite you to express your opinions so that we can exchange them and agree on appropriate methods. The detained goods should be returned, because the Chinese people have already invested in these goods, and prolonged detention has nothing to do with the Japanese, etc. Qiu Liangyu detailed the painstaking efforts of the Japanese to instigate the Koreans to排華. He advocated a severe boycott. Regarding the livelihood of workers, we should endure the pain and sacrifice. Wu Zhihao said that the floods are extremely heavy, and business is difficult. Please submit anti-Japanese opinions in writing to the Chamber of Commerce. The methods for assisting overseas Chinese will be discussed first tonight. Chen Liangyu stated that the previous boycotts of Japanese goods were not thorough. Now, fathers should urge their sons, and brothers should encourage their brothers. This time, we must not repeat the mistakes of the five-minute heat. Lu Qisheng said that the people's spontaneous boycott will not cause international negotiations. Wang Yansong, Ye Jiaxing, and others then expressed their opinions. As a result, it was agreed that the business community would unanimously boycott Japanese goods spontaneously. All inspection and investigation work will be handled by each industry to avoid harassment.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reports that yesterday (14th) it was rumored in this city that the Chinese flood disaster relief authorities are in contact with responsible American merchants to transport 30 million bushels of wheat from the United States to China to provide food for the disaster areas. This wheat will be sold on credit to the Chinese government, with a long repayment period. Currently, the United States is suffering from a wheat surplus and is urgently seeking sales channels. However, various provinces in China are experiencing an unprecedented flood disaster. Not only are the victims currently without food and clothing, but also most of the national autumn harvest has been destroyed. The future is long. If there is no suitable relief method, it is feared that it will lead to chaos. Therefore, if this can become a reality, both China and the United States will benefit.</p>

<p>Thugs Monitor the Hotel Owner</p>
<p>Saying There is No Need to Announce the Revenge</p>
<p>Gunshots Crack Like Machine Guns</p>
<p>Two Travelers Die of Serious Injuries</p>
<p>At the "Fa Shang New Hotel" on West Xinqiao Street in the French Concession, at around 7:30 last night, a revenge murder case occurred involving gunshots. At the time, two travelers were shot dead by thugs, and two others were seriously injured. The perpetrators fled without a trace. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Two Men Check into a Room: The "Fa Shang Hotel" is located at No. 113 West Xinqiao Street in the French Concession. Yesterday afternoon at around 2 pm, two men came to check into a room. The waiter led them to Room No. 2 on the ground floor. One guest was wearing white pants and shirt, and the other was wearing yellow shorts, a white collared shirt, and a Western-style undershirt. They were about 36 or 37 years old. They wrote the name "Wang Xiji" in the register. Both were bare-handed, without luggage, and behaved rudely. After sitting in the room for a few minutes, they went out together, paying a room fee of one silver dollar.</p>
<p>Four Thugs Suddenly Break In: At around 7:15 in the evening, the two travelers calling themselves "Wang Xiji" returned from outside with two other men, one wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, and the other wearing white shorts. Both were around 30 years old and seemed to be from the lower class. After entering Room No. 2, they asked the waiter to bring a teapot and then talked in the room. Unexpectedly, less than a dozen minutes later, four thugs suddenly broke into the hotel. The thugs were all wearing black silk shirts and pants, looking very fierce.</p>
<p>Open Fire on Guests with Handguns: At the time, the hotel owner, Huang Jimei, was cooling off at the entrance. Seeing that the thugs looked suspicious, he was about to ask questions when one of the thugs stepped forward to stop him, monitored him, and said there was no need to announce the revenge, and there was no need to panic. As he spoke, three of them took out handguns from their sleeves and walked towards Room No. 2. Then, a series of gunshots, sounding like machine guns, were heard in the room for about a dozen times.</p>
<p>Great Bloodshed, Two Dead and Two Injured: The travelers and waiters in the hotel were shocked upon hearing the gunshots and hid in fear, not daring to investigate. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the thugs walked out and fled without a trace. Afterwards, the hotel owner urgently sent someone to report the case to the Dadazimingzhong Police Station, who immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to investigate and arrest the perpetrators. Blood was found all over the room. Two people had died from gunshot wounds, and two others were seriously injured, moaning in pain.</p>
<p>Sent to Hospital to Arrest Perpetrators: The two injured men were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment in a police car. One of them, wearing a willow shirt and pants, identified himself as Chen Yiming, from Yancheng, 34 years old, living near the West Gate. He stated that the perpetrators were all acquaintances, but he did not want to disclose the reason. He was shot twice, once in the right chest and once in the left foot. After being injured, he used both hands to hold down the wound and escaped from Room No. 2 to the lobby, where he collapsed on a rattan chair. The other injured man, wearing yellow shorts and a collared shirt, identified himself as Zhong Ziqing, 41 years old, from Jiangbei. His teacher, Ge, knew the details of his matter. He said that he was shot twice, once in the neck and once in the right hand. Both were in critical condition. After questioning the two, the police detectives went out to arrest the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Two Corpses Sent for Examination: The two corpses were sent to the morgue for examination by the court. The two deceased were both around 30 years old, one wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, and the other wearing a white undershirt and pants. The former was injured in the chest and foot, and the latter was injured in the brain and waist. One of them was the first to check into Room No. 2 of the "Fa Shang Hotel." The hotel owner, Huang Jimei, and the waiters were summoned by the police to inquire about the circumstances of the incident for verification.</p>
<p>Private Arms Trafficking Case</p>
<h3 id="e136">Additional Charge of Fraud <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Bi Ke and Le Weisi Gai</p>
<p>Both charged with attempted blackmail and fraud</p>
<p>Wei Xiaolan accused of assisting in fraud</p>
<p>Le Weisi Gai presents a gas mask</p>
<p>Russian Bi Ke and Le Weisi Gai, colluded to impersonate officials of the National Government, ordered military supplies worth 1.8 million from Lai Fa, the owner of the British firm Lai Fa Yanghang on Guangdong Road, and forged Lai Fa's seal. After investigation by the police, a lawsuit was filed in the First Special District Court. After several interrogations, just as the case was about to conclude, Chief Inspector Hua Tan Ma Wenda and West Inspector Bei Zhining from the General Inspectorate arrested Wei Xiaolan at 33 Bushi Road in the French Concession. It was discovered that Wei had been associating with Le Weisi Gai and others at Lai Fa's place. Le pointed out that Wei was the secretary of Zhang Faying, a representative of the National Government. She was handed over to the Special Court for interrogation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Jiashi of the Criminal Court continued the trial in Criminal Division One. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Customs' Response After the trial began yesterday, the police were represented by Lawyer Ru Bao Yi. Bi Ke and Le Weisi Gai were represented by Lawyer Yan Biao Fenling. Wei Xiaolan was represented by Lawyer Fan Gang, and translator Jiang Baoliang was appointed for this case. Lawyer Ru Bao Yi started by stating that the police are now additionally charging Bi Ke and Le Weisi Dong with attempted blackmail and fraud under Article 370, Section 3 of the Criminal Code, and Wei Xiaolan with assisting in the same. Judge Xu then instructed translator Jiang Baoliang to translate to Bi Ke, "This court has now received a letter from the Jianghai Customs Superintendent, stating that you once reported to the Customs that Lai Fa was privately selling military supplies to Guangdong. Later, a woman sent the contract, and she was not under the mission of Customs investigation, etc." Bi replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>Zhang Faying's Secretary Judge Xu then turned to ask Wei Xiaolan whether she and Le Weisi Gai went to Le's house at 24 Shengmu Yuan Road through the introduction of a certain person named Xue Ge Lai Lai. She replied, "Yes. When I arrived at Le's house, Bi Ke also came in less than five minutes. He then asked me to go to Lai Fa's place, but Bi Ke did not go. When we arrived at the entrance of Lai Fa's place, I asked Le what he wanted me to say. He replied to listen to his command. Then we entered together. Le pointed to me and said to Lai Fa, 'This is the secretary of General Zhang Faying.' I did not say anything. Then they began to negotiate about military supplies." Judge Xu asked, "Who wanted to buy the military supplies?" She replied, "They were purchased by Guangdong." He asked, "Where were they being transported to?" She replied, "To Guangdong." He asked, "Who is the general?" She replied, "Zhang Faying is the brother of Zhang Fakui. This happened on May 24th."</p>
<p>Second Contact Judge Xu asked, "When was the second contact?" She replied, "About the next day. I immediately scolded Le, saying that I didn't want to be asked to do such illegal things again." He asked, "Was there any talk about who needed to prove or guarantee it the first time?" She replied, "No, it was only mentioned the next day. On the 25th, Bi Ke and Le Weisi Gai came to my house again and asked me to go to Lai Fa's place with them. I didn't want to. Le said that Lai Fa had prepared wine and dishes, so why not go? I was forced and had to go." He asked, "Did Le Weisi Gai tell you that as long as Zhu Ziyao signed, you could hire a lawyer to claim a commission, which would be very beneficial to you? Is that correct?" She replied, "Yes. When I went to Lai Fa's place the second time, Le asked who would guarantee it. At that time, there were two small photos hanging in the room. Lai Fa immediately said that these two people, one named Tang Jingji and the other Gu Xinyi, were both his friends and could be guarantors. Le expressed unwillingness. At that time, I asked Lai Fa whether Tang Jingji had a steel factory in Yangshupu. Lai Fa replied yes. Then Lai Fa said to Le, 'How about Zhu Ziyao?' Le replied, 'Good. If Zhu cannot guarantee, he can also testify.'" He asked, "Was there any talk about commission at that time?" She replied, "No, this matter was probably discussed before or after."</p>
<p>Little Cantonese Went Along Judge Xu asked, "Is there such a person as Zhang Faying?" She replied, "It's fake." He asked, "How do you know it's fake?" She replied, "Because I didn't want to go to Lai Fa's place with Le Wei Gai, Le said that I couldn't assume the position of general and that he would find someone a little older and resembling a general to impersonate Zhang Faying. Later, a Russian named Si Tiegaofu asked me why I didn't want to do this again. I told him the situation. He immediately said that Le had found someone, that is, the Little Cantonese who lights my cigarettes, to go with him. Then I knew it was a complete fake."</p>
<p>Zhu Ziyao's Testimony Judge Xu then summoned Lai Fa to the case and asked if he knew Wei Xiaolan. He replied, "I know her." He asked, "According to them, this batch of military supplies was purchased by Guangdong." He replied, "No, they said it was ordered by the National Government." He asked, "Since the contract for the purchase of military supplies has already been signed, why is there another order form for more than 500,000 yuan of military supplies? What does that mean?" He replied, "I suppose it was forged to defraud me and Zhu Ziyao of money in order to achieve the purpose of fraud. I request a thorough investigation." Then Zhu Ziyao was summoned. He asked, "What was the purpose of the defendant appointing lawyers Shi Zhuoren and Hailisi to your place?" He replied, "To claim a commission." He asked, "How much money did they want?" He replied, "Nine yuan for each gun." He asked, "Did the two lawyers say that if you didn't pay the commission, they would report that you were guaranteeing the purchase of military supplies on behalf of Guangdong, etc.?" He replied, "They only said that this batch of military supplies was purchased by Guangdong, which was extremely dangerous, etc."</p>
<p>Presenting a Gas Mask Then, lawyer Shi presented evidence, stating that he was commissioned by Le to claim a commission from Zhu Ziyao, totaling more than 69,000 yuan. Judge Xu then asked Le Weisi Gai whether Wei Xiaolan's statement was correct. He replied, "I met Wei at Lai Fa's place. She specializes in introducing the purchase of military supplies to Lai Fa to supply bandits. One day, Lai Fa ordered me to send ten pistols and more than a thousand bullets to Wei's house in the French Concession. The next day, Wei sent over a thousand yuan, the price of the guns." At this point, the court stopped him and asked what he meant by forging an order form for more than 500,000 yuan of military supplies, and he should explain it clearly. Le replied that Lai Fa had sold a kind of gas mask, and he had obtained evidence documents for it. The mask is now at the lawyer's office. The defendant's lawyer presented a mask, which looked like a rope net, to the court. He also claimed that there were many photos and items that were the poisons sold by the plaintiff, with receipts signed by Supervisor Tang and photos taken. Later, because the items were returned, the receipts were also returned.</p>
<p>Three Witnesses Judge Xu then asked Le whether he forged this order form in order to prove that Lai Fa was selling poisons and to gain the trust of Supervisor Tang. Le replied vaguely. Lawyer Ru Bao Yi then stood up and asked Le Weisi Gai who introduced him to Wei Xiaolan. He replied that it was introduced by Lai Fa. Lawyer Ru then stated to the court that the police initially thought that Le would not deny the details provided by Wei Xiaolan. Now, unexpectedly, the opposite is true, so the police have to present witnesses to prove it.

<p>Sheng Rong's Property Case</p>
<h3 id="e137">Temporary Suspension of Trial <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Sheng has another case in the Court of Appeal</p>
<p>Her identity issue has not been resolved</p>
<p>The deceased Wang Sheng Rong, the married granddaughter of the late Qing Dynasty Sheng Gongbao Xingsun, hired three lawyers, Xu Bingcheng, Chen Tingrui, and Li Zuyu, to sue Mao Zengnian, Sheng Yuyou, Sheng Enyi, and others in the First Special District Court for jointly occupying her inheritance. The details of the lawsuit have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over the interrogation in the Third Tribunal. According to the plaintiff Wang Sheng Rong, she is 35 years old and currently resides at 1096 Xinzha Road. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, she was adopted by her third uncle Sheng Youchen as his daughter, and Aichen Gong passed away in the eighth year of the Republic of China. She then lived with her stepmother Gong. On May 18th of this year, Gong passed away, and her stepson Yuyou was not in Shanghai. All funeral ceremonies were carried out under my supervision. Afterwards, the stepmother's inheritance was approximately 100,000 yuan, including 60,000 to 70,000 yuan in cash deposited in banks such as Siming and Shanghai, and jewelry worth 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. At that time, they were all stolen by Mao Zhengnian (Gong's nephew), the first defendant. Yuyou then filed a lawsuit according to law, but for some reason, he withdrew the complaint. Now she is suing Mao Zengnian, Sheng Yuyou, and his father Sheng Enyi for jointly embezzling 100,000 yuan of her stepmother Gong's inheritance, etc. The defendant Sheng Yuyou had business and had already left Shanghai. Sheng Enyi was ill and unable to attend court, and was represented by lawyers Jiang Yiping, Jiang Baoli, and Yu Chengxiu. After a while, the defendant Mao Zengnian hurriedly arrived in court to be questioned. According to his testimony, he is 31 years old, from Suzhou, and currently works at a real estate company at 50 Beijing Road. Sheng Gong was his aunt, and he did not know the details of the plaintiff's adoption at the time. After he was accused of theft, he handed over all the property to Yuyou and closed the case. He did not know anything else. Lawyer Jiang stated that the plaintiff Wang Sheng Rong had previously litigated in the civil court of this court over property division, and lost the case due to the issue of identity. She is now appealing to the High Branch Court, and has already held one hearing, which has been rescheduled. The plaintiff's agent, Lawyer Xu, replied that the previous civil lawsuit was due to the difference between a biological daughter and an adopted daughter. When questioned by Wang Sheng Rong, she also said that although there was no adoption certificate at the time, there was indeed a banquet for guests, etc. Judge Shen verified the testimony and stated that the identity issue in the Court of Appeal has not yet been resolved, so he ordered the case to be temporarily suspended.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Sues for Alimony <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The debate was reopened in Suzhou yesterday</p>
<p>Two more witnesses need to be summoned to court</p>
<p>The case of Dong Yu, a lawyer, and Ms. Jiang's lawsuit regarding their status and alimony was concluded by the High Court on the 21st of last month. The judgment was originally scheduled to be announced on the 25th of the same month, but because the appellee Dong Yu was absent, he filed a petition to reopen the debate. Judge Shen Yuan, the presiding judge of the First Civil Division of the High Court, re-summoned them yesterday (the 15th) morning. The appellant Ms. Jiang, her agents Yuan Jingtang, Zhang Yaozeng, and Sheng Shengxiu, the appellee's agent Qiu Yu, and witnesses Dong Kang and Dong Banggan attended. Dong Yu himself, Dong's mother, and witness Wu Tianni did not attend. After the court opened, the court first instructed Ms. Jiang that Dong Yu had come yesterday and said that he had terminated the marriage contract with you at the French Public Office, and requested to withdraw this case. The court believes that there is doubt regarding the provisions of Article 25 of the agreement cited in the written statement regarding this point and needs to submit it to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. Today is the date for reopening the debate, what do you have to say? Ms. Jiang stated that she and the appellant are the original partners, and her identity has been proven. She demands that the appellee pay alimony of 10,000 yuan. Dong Kang then testified that the marriage certificate was signed by him, and the two letters from the appellee to him referred to Ms. Jiang as his wife, which was indeed written by Dong Yu. Dong Banggan testified that Ms. Jiang went to Dong Yu's house in Xiafei Fang, Xiafei Road last year to move things, and Dong Yu falsely reported the theft to the French police. Next, Dong Yu's agent, lawyer Qiu Yu, stated that he was willing to mediate and ordered Dong to pay alimony of 3,000 yuan. Ms. Jiang then stated that the appellee lives in a Western-style house, with rosewood furniture in the house, and travels in a self-owned car. He can afford the alimony of 10,000 yuan, etc. As a result, the court ordered that two wet nurses who witnessed Ms. Jiang moving things from Dong Yu's house be summoned to court. On the one hand, the point cited in Dong Yu's statement will be submitted to the court for interpretation. After the reply is received, a date will be set and Dong Yu will be summoned to court for review.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Deadline for Banning Rental Temples <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Drafting measures to ban rental temples</p>
<p>Gradual ban by lottery within two years</p>
<p>The Municipal Government previously believed that rental temples only have abbots and no religious buildings, which does not comply with the provisions of Article 1 of the Regulations on Temple Registration promulgated by the Ministry of Interior. Moreover, the city is prosperous and not a place for pure cultivation, and it is difficult to ensure that there is no abuse of collecting money. It was ordered to ban them within a time limit. Later, the Chinese Buddhist Association and others repeatedly sent letters requesting an extension of the ban. The Municipal Government, in order to show its understanding, approved them one after another. Recently, the Municipal Government believes that the ban on rental temples cannot be delayed any longer and will order the drafting of banning measures, aiming to ban them in four phases by lottery within two years. It is learned that the above-mentioned banning measures have been announced and implemented by the Municipal Government. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>1. Temples mentioned in these measures refer to temples established by monks, nuns, Taoists, and female Taoists who have rented houses in this city. 2. Rental temples shall register with the Public Security Bureau within one month from August 15th, 1931. 3.

The first phase is the end of March 1932, the second phase is the end of September 1932, the third phase is the end of March 1933, and the fourth phase is the end of September 1933. 6. The rental temples to be closed in the first, second, and third phases will be determined by lottery. One month in advance, the Public Security Bureau will publish a notice in the newspaper about the number of households to be drawn. The lottery will be held before the 20th of the month. The temples to be closed in the fourth phase will be announced one month in advance. 7. When the lottery is held, in addition to the Social Affairs Bureau sending personnel to participate, legally organized monk and Taoist groups in the city may also send representatives to observe. 8. Those who fail to register after the registration deadline or fail to close when the deadline is reached will be closed by the Public Security Bureau. 9. Once a rental temple is registered, it is not allowed to move, and from the date of registration, it is not allowed to rent a house to establish a temple. 10. Rental temples that have been registered and voluntarily close shall submit a registration certificate to the Public Security Bureau for verification and cancellation. 11. If a registered rental temple violates laws and regulations, spreads rumors to confuse the public, does not abide by monastic rules, or violates the provisions of Article 9, it will be closed immediately. 12. These measures will be implemented from the date of promulgation by the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Announcement from the Cholera Prevention Office <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Cholera Prevention Office issued the third announcement yesterday, stating: (1) According to reports from the Shanghai Chinese Concession health authorities, although no cholera outbreaks have been found in their respective jurisdictions, preventive measures are still being implemented. Special attention is being paid to factories, slum areas, and places where filth and flies are concentrated. (2) Regarding Zhoupu Town, which is ten miles east of Zhoujiadu in Shanghai (direct train access), the investigation report by medical officers Sun Zhirong and Sun Jiaqi is as follows: (A) A limited cholera outbreak occurred three weeks ago, with a total of 18 confirmed cases and five deaths. Their ages ranged from 5 to 66 years old. Those who recovered were due to saline injections. None of the above patients had received cholera vaccinations. (B) The residences of the above patients are all within a one-acre area northeast and south of Zhoupu. (C) Zhoupu is a lively town with a large match factory employing 700 workers. Four of the workers died of cholera this time. (D) The cause of infection for these patients does not seem to be due to the water supply. According to the investigation, it is actually due to flies spreading the cholera bacteria from the patients' feces. Our preventive work is focused on cleaning and disinfecting the town's toilets and preventing flies from coming into contact with them. (E) As of today, 6,700 people have been vaccinated against cholera. The cholera vaccination team sent by the health authorities patrols back and forth on the railway every day, eight times a day, administering vaccinations to passengers arriving in Shanghai from the epidemic area without exception. (F) In summary, the epidemic can be said to have been brought under control, as there have been no further cholera cases at the railway stations along the line. (3) Mr. Sheng Hou, a senior medical officer from the Tokyo Ministry of Interior's Disease Prevention Department, came to Shanghai for ten days (August 1st to August 11th) to investigate the city's health conditions. In the conversation, he said that the Japanese government greatly praised the quarantine work at this port. The Japanese government has now reinstated the Shanghai port and no longer appoints medical officers. Last year, there were a total of 127 cholera cases in Shanghai, and none of the Japanese ports declared Shanghai as an epidemic area. The cholera did not spread to Japan. (4) The cholera vaccination for passengers on the Ninglai ship is still carried out at around 3-4 am every morning when passing Wusong. From August 6th to 14th, a total of 6,730 passengers were vaccinated. Since August 2nd, a total of 10,810 people have been vaccinated.

<p>Already Executed Zheng Ming, the son of Zheng Yushan, a famous pirate from Changshu, wanted to avenge his father. He led his followers to kill, set fires, rob, and kidnap in the Fushan area. The coastal residents were unable to sleep peacefully. A few days ago, Zheng went to Shanghai to add military supplies. The Changshu County Public Security Bureau stationed in Shanghai detected this and joined the Chinese and Western detectives of the Huisi Police Station (formerly the Xinzha Police Station by mistake) to arrest Zheng, searching out 2 Browning pistols. He was handed over to the Special District Court for questioning and ordered to be handed over to the Changshu County Government for interrogation and trial. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is learned that Yin Peng, the director of the Changshu County Public Security Bureau, believed that Zheng was a well-known pirate commander with many followers, and fearing negligence, he personally led eight box-gun squads and detectives to Shanghai the day before yesterday. He submitted a document requesting permission to extradite him. Director Yin then escorted Zheng on the Beijing-Shanghai train to Kunshan, transferred to a small boat, and escorted him back to Changshu for interrogation and trial.</p>

<p>Exterior: Transportation and security are closely related</p>
<p>Wang: A special exhibition is held to inform the public</p>
<p>Yan: Hoping to drive cars all over China</p>
<p>Shuo: Striving is not in vain, even in death</p>
<p>The National Road Association, in order to make the people understand the importance of transportation, held a road exhibition in Shanghai. It is heard that the opening ceremony is scheduled for September 12th on Betang Road in the French Concession. To arouse the attention of all circles and strive for cooperation to promote the progress of the road market, a banquet was held yesterday at noon at the Lianhua General Assembly to entertain Western businessmen in the city. Those present included Minister Wang, Minister Kong (represented by Xu Jianping), American Commercial Counselor Arnold, American Commercial Officer Shi Fangnan, Road Exhibition Chairman Cao Yunxiang, Director-General Yang Nianzu, Chinese and Western Executive Directors Zheng Xitao and Jin Shibo, and foreign merchants Ford, Xiang Mao, China, Yad, and Fada Automobile Companies, as well as Tianxiang, Mobil, Asia, Jardine Matheson, Xinchang, and Huayang Companies. Minister Wang first gave a speech, emphasizing the importance of this exhibition and hoping that manufacturers would actively participate and promote ticket sales. The American Consul and the President of the British Chamber of Commerce and Exhibition Chairman Cao gave speeches, promoting road construction and the importance of joining the exhibition. Around 2:00 PM, a group photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Then, at 3:00 PM, a tea party was held at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to entertain Shanghai groups and leaders from all walks of life, as well as members of the association. Those present included Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, Industry Minister representative Xu Jianping, Deputy Minister Zhao Jinqing, Pacification Commissioner Zhang Zhijiang (newly elected Vice President of the Road Association), Lin Kanghou, Zhang Zhilian, Zhu Shaoping, Shen Yi, Xiang Kangyuan, Tang Jingxian, Wang Yingbin, Tao Guilin, Li Songquan, Dong XianGuang, Hua LaiFeng (representative of Guizhou Province), Wu Yunzhai, Tao Leqin, Li Shilin (engineer of the association), Director-General Wu Shan, Li Bake, Wu Dongchu, Zheng Zhengqiu, and foreign guests Mr. Louier, Norman, Halcand, L, M, Smith, Miss Viola Smith, Miss E. Hinder and Thedore Chen and S.C. Kingshung, Chinese &amp; Foreign Executive Secutanes, etc. First, Minister Wang delivered the opening speech, briefly saying that ten years ago, China had only a few hundred miles of highways, and now it has reached 40,000 to 50,000 miles. This achievement is due to the support of the central government, provincial governments, and local governments, as well as the promotion by the people. Now, in order to make the people understand the importance of national transportation and security and commercial relations, a special exhibition is held to further promote the progress of the road market. More than 20 provinces across the country have sent representatives to participate, as far as Guizhou, which also specially sent Mr. Hua Laifeng to Shanghai to attend. In addition, governments and groups from various countries have also sent exhibits for display, some of which have already been received, and some are still on the way, which is of great benefit to promoting roads. Because of the vastness of China's land, convenient transportation is the top priority. If railways are built in the shortest possible time, it will not only require a lot of money, but also be too slow to solve the urgent need and is not suitable for long distances. As for roads, it is not the same. The completion of a road is fast and quick. Even if it is as short as 50 or 100 miles, it can be built independently. At present, the most difficult thing for roads in China is Weihaiwei. Since the reception commissioner Xu Zushan took office, he has paid attention to the construction of roads, advocating government and people to cooperate in using farmers' supply of equipment and materials, and the government has also worked hard. Therefore, all villages in Weihaiwei have roads, which are connected and convenient for travel, and the local atmosphere is booming and becoming more prosperous. Therefore, the association hopes that the people in various places will follow the example of Weihaiwei, so that road construction can make great progress. According to the current exhibition, there are two methods that can help each other: (1) renting booths to display products, and (2) promoting ticket sales. I believe that the late Premier attached great importance to material construction, and reforming China's roads is also one of the main policies of the Premier's Outline of National Construction. The construction of roads can be seen as early as possible, and politics, education, and economy can also be implemented and improved in turn, and gradually become better. If traffic is blocked, industry will not prosper, and if there is a bandit police, it will be inconvenient to transport troops. Therefore, the quality of the road association's management has a great relationship with the future governance of China. My wish is to be able to drive a car all over the 28 provinces of China, so it is not in vain to work hard to promote it, and I will be content even in death. Then Wu Shan reported on the achievements of the Road Association and the enthusiasm of all parties to participate in this exhibition. Lin Kanghou then gave a speech, saying that all things in China are not on track because there is no road. If you want everything to be on track, you must promote road construction. Therefore, as the saying goes, "If this road is not passable, if the road is passable, everything can be solved easily." Next, Zhang Zhijiang gave a speech, saying that the association did not abandon the humble and newly elected him as the vice president. He said that he could only follow behind everyone to promote the construction. The Premier's National Construction Strategy says that clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the essential elements of life, and transportation has a significant impact on inland security and national border defense. The brothers used to be in the northwest Mongolia and other places. They did not have much road traffic and had a very deep impression. Therefore, they felt that actively building roads was an urgent matter. Finally, tea and snacks were served, and a group photo was taken to dismiss the meeting.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces believes that disaster relief in various provinces is a matter of urgency. Although a small amount of funds has been raised so far, the disaster area has expanded and a large amount of funds is needed. Yesterday, letters were sent to the standing committee members and all executive committee members of the association, attaching donation books, asking them to appeal to all parties for donations to save the victims. The original letter is recorded below: Dear Sir, since the beginning of summer this year, continuous rain has been a disaster. The Yangtze River, Huai River, Yellow River, Pearl River, and Songhua River basins have all been flooded, and the dikes have collapsed. The disaster area has reached 16 provinces, and the number of victims has reached 80 million. The tragic situation is tearful to describe. The fundraising notice is just a brief description, but it is indeed an unprecedented catastrophe. Relief is extremely difficult and urgent. We have always admired your concern for the hungry and drowning, and your empathy. We respectfully present you with donation books, and we respectfully ask you to donate generously and to do your best to raise funds on our behalf, and to hand them over to our association at any time, so that we can distribute them for emergency relief as soon as possible, which will benefit the survivors. We are limited in our expectations, and we are waiting for your moral teachings. We wish you all the best. The Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces.</p>

<p>The farmland in various districts of Shanghai County was previously damaged by continuous rain for ten days.

It is now learned that Peng, the district head of Tangwan in the second district of the county, has also reported to the county that the farmland in his jurisdiction has also been damaged, and requested the county to investigate and provide relief. The county government immediately ordered the county finance bureau to send officials to conduct an on-the-spot investigation together with the district head, and then re-examine it.</p>
<p>French Mail Ship and Japanese Ship</p>
<h3 id="e159">Collided in the Huangpu River Yesterday <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Both Suffered Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a collision occurred in the Huangpu River between a French mail ship and a Japanese freighter, causing heavy losses to both sides. After detailed investigation by reporters from all sides, the damage is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Condition of the Collision: The French Mail Ship Company's Ong Gance, at 10:20 am yesterday morning, completed loading cargo and passengers at the China Merchants Bureau Middle Dock in Hongkou. When it set sail to exit the port, it ordered the Wudefeng tugboat to take it out to Wusong. At the beginning of sailing from the dock, the tugboat was backing up to the center of the river, and then turned east to throw anchor at the 1st and 2nd river cylinders in front of the Yesong Shipyard. The Kawasaki Steamship Company freighter Boutuson Maru, Bordeaux Moru, managed by Showa Corporation in Shanghai, was transporting goods from San Francisco, USA, to Shanghai, and was unloading goods at the river cylinder. Unexpectedly, the French mail ship had not yet turned straight, and was hit by the fierce tide, which was unstoppable. The bow of the French mail ship crashed into the bow of the Japanese ship. With a loud bang, both ships were damaged.</p>
<p>Both Bows Suffered Huge Damage: The Japanese ship was parked on the river cylinder. When the French mail ship collided with it, it was unable to back up and had to listen to the collision. The place where the Japanese ship was hit was the front of the bow. The French ship has 15,000 tons, and because of the huge tide, the bow was hit and the iron plate was torn down, the bow was damaged, and it was broken towards the sky. At a glance, it looked like a headless ship. The French mail ship was also hit back, and the left side of the bow was also broken due to excessive impact, and the outer iron plate was broken, creating a large hole. Fortunately, it was above the waterline, so it was not flooded, but the loss was also huge.</p>
<p>Personnel Sent to Investigate Damage: After the incident, the Japanese ship reported to Showa Yanghang and notified the French Mail Ship Company, and reported to the director of the Customs and Port Affairs Bureau. Each company sent a fair person to the ship to investigate the damage to the two ships and inquire about the truth of the accident. The issue of responsibility will be negotiated separately. The French mail ship could not miss the deadline, so it immediately set sail to exit the port. The damaged hole had to be repaired along the way, and then it would be sent to the factory after arriving in France. The bow of the Japanese ship has been smashed and needs to be overhauled in Shanghai. Yesterday, the goods were rushed to unload. After clearing the cabin, it will be sent to the dock. It is said that the loss of the two ships this time will be tens of thousands of yuan.</p>

<p>Cancellation of Ship Certificates: The Shanghai shipping industry requested the Ministry to cancel the inner port ship certificates, which hinder business. The Ministry of Finance has approved it, and even the Yangtze River ship certificates have been abolished. However, the supplementary measures after the cancellation have been ordered by the Ministry of Communications to the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau to discuss with the customs and various shipping companies to come up with a proper plan. The results of the discussion are: (1) River boat licenses, except for foreign merchant boats, are allowed to be cancelled; (2) After the cancellation of the inner port boat licenses, there are concerns about tax evasion, and other methods should be discussed. It has been decided that if merchant ships travel to the inner port, they must fill out a request to send to customs, along with the ministry certificate, and hand it over to the ship for safekeeping. When the ship returns to the due date, the request form will be submitted to the customs for cancellation.</p>
<p>Dayu Sets Sail: Dalian Company's Daji ship has been completed since its reconstruction and renamed Dayu. It has resumed navigation to Tongyang yesterday. This ship has been greatly renovated, and the layout of the passenger seats is very spacious and beautiful, and it has hot and cold steam equipment. It is the most outstanding ship in the Tongyang line.</p>
<p>Anhui Wharf Submerged: Yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai received a telegram from Anqing, saying that due to the influence of the sharp increase in upstream water in central Anhui, the river water has been increasing day and night, and has submerged the land. The wharves of various shipping companies along the river have all entered the water, and the lower floors of the warehouses have been completely submerged in the water, and passengers cannot load or unload. Please Shanghai stop loading Anqing goods as soon as possible. Various circles are currently rescuing them.</p>

<p>The City Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries</p>
<h3 id="e162">National Goods Prices Must Not Be Raised <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to all industry associations regarding the fact that national goods prices must not be raised during the period of boycott of Japanese goods: Dear Sirs, we have received a letter from the Secretariat of the Shanghai Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, No. 2883, which states that the third district party department reported that during this time of economic severance with Japan, it is an opportunity for national goods to sell well. All national goods factories and shops, in order to promote national goods and boycott Japanese goods, should sell national goods at fair prices, and at the same time, strive to improve the quality of national goods, so that the people of the whole country are happy to purchase them. However, it is reported that some unscrupulous merchants are madly raising the prices of national goods in secret, which has a great impact on the future of boycotting Japanese goods and promoting national goods. Please inform and advise all national goods shops not to raise the prices of national goods for no reason, so as to promote and benefit the boycott of Japanese goods. Based on this, the standing committee approved the transfer of the letter to the City Chamber of Commerce for handling. Correspondingly, the letter is sent to you for your reference and implementation. It is important to note that this is a good opportunity to develop national goods during the period of boycott of Japanese goods, and sales should be made at the same price to show promotion. Unfortunately, there are always short-sighted merchants who secretly raise prices and profit from them, which has a profound impact on the future of boycotting Japanese goods and promoting national goods. Now, in accordance with the previous reason, a corresponding letter is sent to you for your reference and transmission, and it is hoped that you will strictly abide by it.</p>
<p>Social Bureau</p>
<h3 id="e163">Prohibit Direct Action by Publishing Industry <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Both Sides Should Wait Quietly for Legal Handling</p>
<p>The employees of the Zhonghua and Shijie bookstores have made demands to improve their treatment conditions. The publishing industry union has set a deadline for the two bookstores' management to reply, and the situation is quite serious. The Social Bureau is deeply concerned that direct action by both labor and management will lead to unnecessary disputes. Yesterday, it specially ordered the book industry association and the publishing industry union: In order to comply with the order, since the establishment of the Zhonghua and Shijie bookstores branch offices by the publishing industry union and the proposal of improved treatment conditions, the two sides have not followed the correct procedure of the labor-management dispute handling law, but have been attacking each other in the newspapers, causing social misunderstandings and unnecessary disputes, which is very inappropriate. In addition to separate orders, you are urgently ordered to comply with the order, to instruct you to pay attention, and to wait quietly for the Bureau to handle it. Before the Bureau has approved the measures, neither party is allowed to take direct action.</p>
<p>Western Cuisine Industry</p>
<h3 id="e164">Workers Failed to Resume Work Yesterday <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Union Will Discuss the Report to the Authorities for Approval Today</p>
<p>After the workers in the Western cuisine industry in the city went on strike, they all complied with the order to resume work yesterday. Regarding the treatment conditions, they planned to wait quietly for the competent authorities to resolve them according to law. Unexpectedly, the management refused, so the resumption of work failed. The union has decided to hold a general meeting of members today to discuss countermeasures. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Authorities Stop It: In addition to mediating the treatment conditions in the Western cuisine industry, the Social Bureau also approved the order of the Western Cuisine Industry Union to stop the strike: The report is noted. The union's request for the management to improve treatment should be submitted to the Bureau for approval in accordance with legal procedures. Automatic strike is very inappropriate. You are now required to instruct all workers to resume work on the 15th, and no mistakes are allowed. The order is urgent, and the industry association is ordered not to deliberately make things difficult when the workers resume work.</p>
<p>Refuse to Resume Work: The workers in the Western cuisine industry, in compliance with the order, went to resume work yesterday morning, accompanied by members of the union. Regarding the treatment conditions, they quietly waited for the Social Bureau to mediate according to law. Quan Jiafu, Pacific, Royal Palace, Zui Hechun, Yizhi Xiang, Daguanlou, Yijia Chun, Hengsheng, Jinlong, and other Western cuisine industry management all refused to resume work because they had already hired non-union members to work. All the workers had no choice but to withdraw and report to the union to be submitted to the party and government organs for handling.</p>
<p>Union Attitude: Yao Pingqing, standing director of the Western Cuisine Industry Union, told reporters from the New Sound Society that the workers' automatic strike was caused by the management's lack of sincerity in accepting the conditions, and the responsibility lies with the management. Today, all the workers are resuming work in compliance with the order, but the management actually refused. Moreover, the Social Bureau had previously ordered the management industry association not to deliberately make things difficult when the workers resumed work, so the management's violation of the law and the destruction of the labor movement have become obvious. The workers of this union were very angry, and fortunately, the union tried its best to dissuade them, so that no changes occurred. The union has now submitted the situation of the management refusing to resume work to the authorities for review, and requested that the treatment conditions be mediated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Association's Statement: Reporters from the Wuchen Society yesterday ordered members of the Western Cuisine Industry Association Lin Zhenchuan and Yan Furen. The talks between the two gentlemen are recorded as follows: The two gentlemen said that the workers' strike was really unfortunate for the industry, and the operating losses have already been considerable. The treatment of workers in the industry has been very generous for decades. In addition to the wages they receive, the workers are given a dividend based on the business calculations, so they have been at peace for a long time. The proposed improvement of treatment conditions this time is a purely unreasonable demand, and it can be seen that they have been incited. Please explain: (1) The public account of small accounts is a long-standing custom in the industry. The small account is the dividend, which is calculated based on the total amount of business. Although the associate is the agent of the employer, he has personally entertained guests and responded to them in fact, so the small account he gets in return is not as much as they say, exceeding more than three shares. As for the miscellaneous expenses, it is actually the cost of the consumers of the guests who have obtained the dividend, such as towels, perfume, soap, and small items. Occasionally, they are compensated for it, and the amount is very small, and of course the shop owner cannot be asked to bear it. It is unprecedented to create a new name for it. (2) Extra rewards are small accounts given by customers after paying the bill, and are distributed to the workers who should serve and serve, and those who are not worth it are difficult to share. Both of these are true situations, and there have been examples of such things long before the workers requested improvement. As for articles (3) (5) (6), the conditions proposed are contrary to laws and regulations, and will not be discussed here. The fourth article, the so-called calculation of wages for double work in July and August of the lunar calendar, shows that among the businesses of the shops in the industry, only the business in July and August is relatively considerable, and the losses in the other ten months are inevitable. Therefore, the shops in the industry have losses every year, and they are almost unsustainable. As for Article (7), the kitchen leftovers, that is, fish heads and leftover tails, are related to the shop owner's capital, and are usually included in the small account and distributed publicly, and the benefits should be treated the same as the shop owner. Why bother to change things? The losses suffered by the shops in the industry due to the strike are really considerable. In order to maintain business and protect the city's peace, they have to hire other partners to work. It has been declared that the striking workers have been dismissed and reported to the City Social Bureau for record. It seems that the union's free action violates laws and regulations, causing unexpected losses to the industry. The late Premier once said, "Chinese workers are not yet oppressed by domestic capitalists. Since the labor tide, Chinese workers are not only not oppressed by domestic capitalists, but also want to use various methods to oppress domestic capitalists." Why can the industry be called capitalists? It is not easy to operate on a small scale, and how can it be destroyed? In order to respect laws and regulations and seek social security, the authorities should sanction them according to law.</p>

<p>French Concession Water and Electricity Workers Demand Implementation of Eight-Hour Workday. The Union is Waiting for the Company's Reply. The Workers Injured in the Conflict Have Fully Recovered. The Various Situations are Recorded as Follows:</p>
<p>Waiting for a Reply: The workers demanded that the company implement an eight-hour workday in accordance with the Factory Law. The situation was quite serious. The Social Bureau summoned them for questioning and heard that it had instructed the French Concession Water and Electricity Company to truthfully report the current working situation so that it could be verified. The Second District Water and Electricity Industry Union is waiting for the company to reply before the 18th.</p>
<p>The Injury Has Fully Recovered: Li Qishu, the No. 2 investigator, Sun Yinglong, the No. 23 driver, Zhu Wanjin, the No. 7 ticket seller, Liu Fusheng, the No. 13 ticket seller, Sun Hengzhi, the No. 17 ticket seller, and Shi Yingfu, the No. 196 ticket seller, who were injured in the conflict between the car and engine workers, have all fully recovered after being sent to the Guangci Hospital, but have not yet been discharged from the hospital. The company has not yet replied to the conditions of the Car Department yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Father Lao of the Observatory Returned Home Yesterday <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Great America Evening News said that Father Lao, the former director of the Xujiahui Observatory, had been in China for 50 years and presided over the observatory for 35 years. He is a world-renowned wind expert. He has now retired due to old age and took the French mail Angus back to China this morning (15). He will spend his remaining years in peace and may never come to China again. Therefore, many people from Shanghai went to the China Merchants Bureau Middle Dock to see him off, and everyone was sad and reluctant to leave. As for the director of the observatory he left behind, Father Qi is now taking over.</p>
<h3 id="e167">The Case of the Collision of the New Kang Vessel Opened Yesterday <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Defendant Japanese Post Office Did Not Attend</p>
<p>Litigation Assistance Provides Guarantee</p>
<p>The case of the China Merchants Bureau's New Kang vessel being sunk by the Japanese merchant Ryuno Maru two years ago, in which 205 family members of the victims, such as Gao Decai and Zhu Xiaoyun, sued the Japan Mail Steamship Company for damages of 1,101,861 yuan, 2 jiao and 7 fen, was heard in the 9th court of the Shanghai Special Zone Court yesterday morning by Judge Li Mo. No one from the defendant's side attended. The plaintiff was represented by lawyers Wu Jingxiong and Sheng Zhenwei. A large number of family members and groups attended the court to listen. First, Lawyer Sheng made a statement, and then he summoned the plaintiffs such as Zhu Xiaoyun for questioning. Regarding the issue of litigation fees, the plaintiff and the agent lawyer stated that since the unfortunate death of the family members of the victims, the lives of the family members of the victims were almost desperate. Those who were rescued were completely washed away with their property and were spared only with their lives. Now, most of them are unemployed and have no means of support, and it is still difficult to maintain their daily lives. They really have no energy to raise litigation fees. They requested to take into account the circumstances and allow litigation assistance. The judge then declared that the nature of this case is not comparable to ordinary civil cases. Although the Sino-Japanese treaty has expired and is invalid, there are actually many problems. Assistance can be approved, but a proper guarantee must be provided to prove that the family members of the victims are indeed unable to pay the litigation fees, in whole or in part. When the family members of the victims are ordered to bear the burden, they must guarantee that they will find ways to pay. The plaintiff and the agent lawyer promised to comply with the instructions and proceed. At this point, the court was adjourned and a date was set for another trial. It is heard that the family members of the victims plan to ask Yu Qiaqing, chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Association, to guarantee everything.</p>

<p>Fined Eighty Yuan</p>
<p>He Jinzhi, a native of Nanjing, was seen holding reactionary newspapers such as the Shanghai Minbao and Minsheng Bao on the evening of the 6th of this month and shouting and selling them along the way of Aiduya Road near the Grand World in the French Concession.

After being reviewed by the Second Special Court, he was instructed to wait for a change of date for further interrogation. Yesterday was the date for the continued interrogation. He was sent to the Criminal Simple Court. First, the lawyer of the police station, Fei Xizhen, explained the case, and stated that the newspapers violated Articles 3, 19, and 35 of the Publishing Law and the French Consul's regulations on banning publications. He asked for an investigation. In He Jinzhi's confession, he said that a friend surnamed Zhao gave him the newspapers to sell. He did not know his address. He was uneducated, which led him to be fooled. He asked for leniency. After the judge Wu Fanglian verified the confession, he announced the end of the debate in court and sentenced the defendant to a fine of 80 yuan. If he was unable to pay, two yuan would be deducted for one day of imprisonment.</p>

They are currently being transferred from Dalian to Shanghai, and Mr. Song of the Ruikang Company in Dongjuchang Customs Brokerage House, across from Yuanfang Foreign Company on Sichuan Road, is selling them on behalf of them. The price is very reasonable. Therefore, in recent days, gentry, merchants, men and women in Shanghai and the nearby areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have gone to select and purchase them.</p>

<p>—Hai Ke</p>
<p>Throwing Shoes After the Wedding Ceremony</p>
<p>After European and American men and women have gone through the wedding ceremony, when they get in the car to go on their honeymoon, their relatives and friends often throw many old shoes at them. This is a common custom, and everyone is used to it. According to most people, its origin is very ancient. It was first created in Egypt. At that time, there were many races who regarded women as a kind of property. The Jews were especially like this. When trading with people, they would hand over a shoe as a settlement. When women married, it was like a kind of transaction, so shoes were also used. Down to the present, it has become a custom of throwing shoes through miscommunication.</p>
<p>Others say that among savage races, the custom of kidnapping brides was prevalent. The groom often rode alone to the bride's home and kidnapped the bride alive. His family was unwilling to give up and came out to chase him. Unable to catch up, they had to throw things up in the back to vent their anger. Unexpectedly, this savage custom has now been adopted by civilized people.</p>
<p>An old custom of the Saxons: When a woman got married, her father always had to give one of her shoes to the groom. The groom took it in his hand and touched it on the bride's forehead to show that he could discipline her in the future. This is also a legacy of ancient times, and in modern times, it has been unknowingly entangled.</p>

<p>—Jie Shan</p>
<p>Ninety-nine people, including Zhu Leizhang, passed the five examinations of this year's Higher Examination. The ceremony for awarding the passing certificates was held in the auditorium of the Examination Yuan at 8:00 AM on the 12th. Central Committee members and heads of various ministries were present, including Chen Bulei, Liu Ruiheng, Ma Fuxiang, Ru Yuli, Chen Yi, and Miao Fucheng. Dai Chuanxian, the president of the Examination Yuan, Shao Yuanchong, the chairman of the Examination Committee, Wang Yongbin, the vice chairman, and all the associate examiners, examiners, supervisors, and committee members, as well as hundreds of officials above the rank of Jianren in the Examination Yuan and its affiliated ministries. Eighty-seven of the passers were present. There were many things to see and hear during the ceremony. I will describe them as follows.</p>
<p>The situation of awarding certificates When awarding certificates, Dai Chuanxian and the chairmen of the Examination Committee, Shao Yuanchong and Wang Yongbin, personally awarded the certificates by name. The candidates stood in a row in solemn silence. When their name was called, they responded and went three steps forward to the front of the podium. They stood upright and bowed to the certificate presenter. They stepped forward three steps and respectfully received the certificate with both hands. Then, they stepped back three steps to their original position and stood upright. They held the certificate in their left hand, let their right hand hang down, and bowed to the certificate presenter. After the ceremony, they slowly returned to the row. All the candidates were respectful and respectful when receiving the certificate, and it was quite quiet.</p>
<p>Speeches and Replies After the certificates were awarded, Central Committee member Chen Bulei gave a speech first, followed by National Government member Liu Ruiheng. Then, President Dai and Chairman Shao gave speeches. The words were all encouraging and inspiring, and the expectations for the candidates were very high. After the speeches, Zhou Bangdao, who was publicly recommended by the candidates as the first-class candidate for educational administration personnel, gave a reply. Mr. Zhou's words were solemn and slightly humorous, and the listeners were quite satisfied.</p>
<p>A glimpse of the prizes In addition to each member of the examination office receiving a silver commemorative badge as a souvenir, those who were listed as first-class were also given a complete set of the Prime Minister's works in a fine binding by President Dai and a copy of the Covenant printed by the National Assembly. Those who were excellent were given a complete set of the Prime Minister's works in a regular binding. Chairman Shao gave a complete set of the collected volumes of the Construction Monthly to the first and second place winners of each test. And a mirror frame written by himself. The inscriptions were: "Articles Illuminate the Country," "Heavy Responsibility and Distant Zhi," "Covering the Middle and Manifesting the Outer," "Great Virtue Carries Things," and "Healthy Action," etc.) In addition, Ms. Zhang Mojun, a member of the examination committee, was good at calligraphy and wrote five folding fans to give to the four who were listed as first-class. The remaining one was given to Xue Quanzeng, who passed two examinations at the same time. Shao also gave Mr. Xue a mirror frame and a copy of the Construction Monthly to show his excellence.</p>
<p>A banquet at Hualin Hall After the ceremony, a photo was taken and a visit to the mausoleum was made. At noon at 12 o'clock, the Examination Yuan hosted a banquet in the Hualin Hall of the Yuan (ie, the library of the Yuan) to entertain the candidates. Drinks were exchanged and the hosts and guests were happy. It was not until 3:00 PM that the event ended. The candidates left the door with a spring breeze on their faces. Their pride can be known.

<h3 id="e186">Coal-Made Protein <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>—Update</p>
<p>Professor Klent of Germany recently made a surprising report at the annual meeting of the Bochum Scientific Research Association, that is, a new discovery that protein can be extracted from coal. According to Dr. Klent, he has proven the relationship between a certain by-product of coal and animal protein. This new discovery is indeed very important. Because in terms of production value, coal-made protein is easier to compete with than animal products. Although it is not yet time to replace natural products with artificial products as food, it is quite possible to use mineral protein as food. It is also heard that this new discovery of Ke will be subjected to large-scale experiments to make it applicable and benefit the world.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Record of the Independence Parade in the Philippines <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>—Wen Chu sent from Manila</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of the Filipinos for independence can be said to be even greater. At present, the ruling tycoons and merchants in the business community have a perfunctory attitude. The United States wants to compete for naval power in the Pacific Ocean and cannot abandon its naval base in the East. And the major merchants do not want to import more than 150 million items of goods into the Philippines every year. Once they are subject to tariff restrictions with other countries. (Philippine customs revenue. The United States, as the sovereign state, has tax-free preferential rights. Therefore, American goods account for 65% of imports each year.) However, Philippine sugar exported to the United States also enjoys tax-free preferential rights. The southern provinces of the United States are sugar producing areas and are affected by competition in trade. Congressional representatives from the province strongly advocate allowing the Philippines to become independent immediately in order to avoid hindering American agriculture. This is why there are often human……justice……tones in Congress. It seems to be speaking out for the Filipinos.</p>
<p>US Senator Howe is the most supportive of Philippine independence. This time, he came to the Philippines to investigate the political and social conditions, as materials for discussion in the US Congress in the future. The Philippine legislature believes that the Filipinos should have a clear expression, so that Howe has a deep impression. Therefore, the independence parade was prepared on the previous Sunday to show that the Philippine people's demand for independence comes from the rational public opinion of the majority of the people.</p>
<p>All government personnel in Manila and nearby provinces, regardless of official rank, and registered social organizations and major factories, must join the parade. Railway companies offer special free tickets to on-the-job personnel and social organizations in various provinces. Therefore, on that day, train passengers were very crowded. Various social organizations also urged military bands to help the fun and join the number of people. There were more than 150,000 people. There was almost no space in front of the Congress and the large grass field for shade. Tram cars and horse-drawn carriages cut off traffic for almost three hours.</p>
<p>On that day, people from all walks of life, both men and women, wore a common uniform made from Philippine-produced and self-made materials. General Yaginado, the first republican president who abdicated 31 years ago, and Luo Xia, the current Speaker of the House, also held the independence flag and led the way in civilian uniforms. However, schools are bound by the established rules that they cannot join any political movement. Therefore, students from Chinese and major universities can only join the parade as individuals and cannot use the names of their respective schools.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Eulogy for Xu Qishang <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>—Ji Zhai</p>
<p>Qishang's name is Pengling, from Qingpu, Jiangsu. A Jinshi in the Gui Mao year, he was a director of the Ministry of Justice. He graduated from the Jinshi Hall and then graduated from the Faculty of Law of the Central University of Japan. He returned to China in the early years of the Republic of China and served as the director of the Criminal Division of the Ministry of Justice and the presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the Dali Yuan. He has written manuscripts such as Annotations on the Criminal Laws of Various Countries and Lectures on Criminal Procedure Law. Two years ago, the national capital moved south and he returned to his hometown to practice law. He lived in Zhang's Villa, Tong Deli, Xiaoyi Fang, Suzhou. He died of illness in late June. The poem recalls Jiangnan's regional examination in the Renyin year. There were four people from the same hometown in the same year. You mourn him.</p>
<p>He has the least talent and fame. I became closer because of the neighborhood. The Central Plains gave me a dream of the past. I followed the dust to see the sights of Beique. In the bleak and Xiao Xiao plum rain, the obituary came from Taihu Lake.</p>
<p>Last winter, I visited the old place in Suzhou. I only heard about the old age and sorrow. We met for a short time for half a year. Who knew that we would be separated forever. The fall of the legalist is not a private mourning. The remaining manuscripts should be searched as soon as possible. The testamentary book clarifies the science of criminal law. Dongying does not have to be inferior to Western Europe.</p>

<p>—Linghua</p>
<p>On this day, I visited the small village north of the Deer Garden Sana University. The houses are low and small. It is still a yellow tile house. It is only separated by a river from the ruins of Sana. This river does not seem to be a long river. Or a large pond. Can't tell. There are several shepherdesses and cattle among them. Go to the village from here. There is no main road. There are few trees. And the road south of Sana. How neat it is. Like the road in the Shanghai Concession. The trees are also tall. The trees in the village are small and there are many cacti. There is wheat field next to it. Men and women are harvesting wheat. There is no rain in the dry season. A lot of dust. There are many white cows in the village. How dark the children are. I observe the darkness of the children. I know that it is indeed a racial relationship. Indians are very particular about bloodlines. Do not intermarry with other races. However, their appearance is not superior to other races. Only vegetarianism to connect with God. Indifferent and few desires. Although. Indians excel in the study of internal light. Children do not dislike their mothers ugly. Dogs don't dislike their families poor. Now all countries hold disciple rituals to worship the Buddha and Hinduism. Why should I use my naked eyes to look at the black people of India. Zhuangzi said. Tao gives it appearance. Heaven gives it form. Indians do not talk about industry and agriculture. The fields are not lush. The amount of harvest. Should not be good. Because they raise many cattle. So collect cow dung. And make it into cakes to burn it. It's all the same everywhere. Same as northern China. I often pass by various villages. Indian dogs do not seem to bite people very much. Or the countryside is all poor people. Belonging to the inferior ethnic group of the fourth level. There are only awe of the three tribes above.</p>
<p>I asked the Ceylonese master. Are there any surviving royal families of the Buddha today? The master replied no. A gentleman next to him said that the Shakya clan was hated by a certain king at that time. A certain king would destroy his clan. Asked how many people would be left if they were willing to keep their clan. Intermarriage is also possible. The Shakya clan replied that they did not want to stay. A certain king killed them all. I don't remember much. It seems like the affair of King Glazed Tile's attack on the Shakya clan. At that time, the Buddha was still alive. The Buddha originally viewed resentment and relatives as equal. The four great things are empty. There is no one in his descendants. It is not the Buddha's concern. I also asked if there were any surviving relatives of the Buddha's family. The person did not know either. For a long time, he said. The old capital of the Buddha, Kapilavastu, is now in ruins. If there are any survivors among his relatives, they may be in Nepal. The reason for the visit is that it is close to Nepal. I will use science to study according to the scriptures. Those who will reconcile the world's killing opportunities in the future are only in using the method of intermarriage. To greatly mix bloodlines. Try to view the extinction of the Shakya clan, which is not without the reason that it did not intermarry with other ethnic groups.</p>

<p>—Yao Su Feng</p>
<p>Let's leave the matter here for now. Let's just say that Xiao Rong's wife took a car to Tongfu Road. According to the number of the house that Mr. Li told her, she found Miss Ding's house.</p>
<p>She was very timid. At first, she really felt that she didn't have the courage to knock on the two doors. But later, she was burned by angry emotions and couldn't control herself after all. So she walked forward and knocked hard on the door.</p>
<p>Miss Ding happened to have returned from Suzhou. She had only been home for two hours. She was dozing upstairs. When she heard someone knocking on the door below, but not ringing the doorbell, she naturally felt very strange. She called Qiu Zi and asked her to see who was knocking on the door. Qiu Zi was in the room inside. At first, she didn't hear it. When Miss Ding called her, she quickly went downstairs to open the door.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong's wife originally came with a belly full of resentment, but she couldn't vent it when she saw people. When Qiu Zi opened the door, she was stunned and didn't know what to say.</p>
<p>"Who are you looking for?" Qiu Zi was very strange when she saw that the person knocking on the door was an unfamiliar woman.</p>
<p>"I'm here to look for Xiao Rong!" she said without thinking.</p>
<p>"Xiao Rong? There's no such person here! You're looking for the wrong person!"</p>
<p>"Then is this the Ding family?" Xiao Rong's wife was a little anxious.</p>
<p>"That's right!" Qiu Zi replied.</p>
<p>"Don't you have a lady who has been to Suzhou?"</p>
<p>"Yes! What are you asking him for?"</p>
<p>"I'm here to look for that person surnamed Lu who went to Suzhou with the lady here!"</p>
<p>"Ah! It's Mr. Lu! You didn't say so earlier! He's not called Xiao Rong! But what's the matter with you looking for him?" Qiu Zi was very suspicious.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong's wife saw that Qiu Zi was very kind. She only felt that she had no place to vent her full of resentment. Instead, she told her in a low voice: "He is my husband?......I have important things to say to him in person!"</p>
<p>Qiu Zi almost didn't believe it! She thought of Mr. Lu's appearance in her mind, and then looked at the woman in front of her who called Mr. Lu her husband. She felt confused and couldn't figure it out. She only said in surprise: "What? That Mr. Lu is your husband?"</p>
<p>"How can I make a confused and random identification? Just call him out!" Xiao Rong's wife suppressed her anger again and said with a pleading expression.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lu came and went out again! But wait for me to tell our lady! You wait, maybe our lady will see you." Qiu Zi was really smart. She immediately understood the importance of this matter.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Xiao Rong's wife could only wait outside the door. On the other hand, Qiu Zi flew upstairs to report.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Futures Gold Market Shows Tendency to Rise <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The Bull Side Posts Three Taels Plus</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 15th, the gold exchange market began its forward transactions. Because today is Sunday, it was moved forward by one day. The market officially opened at 8 o'clock in the morning. However, gold firms arrived even earlier, gathering outside the exchange as early as 6 or 7 o'clock to start trading. The bull side was posting three taels and two or three qian for September to October, initially at three taels, with a listed price of three taels one qian five fen, later fluctuating around three taels. It is rumored that the bull and bear sides have not completely settled their transactions, with the bear side gaining momentum. Qian Changxiang, Chengfeng, Yongyongheng, and those hedging positions are mostly on the bull side. Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Tongfeng, Henghengxing, and spot firms are all bears. It is expected that September will have no further significant activity, with most switching to October contracts. The opening price was 772 taels and 8 qian 5 fen, and the closing price was 75 taels and 5 fen, a rebound of 4 taels and 2 qian compared to the previous day. This is due to the conversion based on the listed price for October contracts. As for the October market, it seems to be trending upward, but the fluctuations are moderate. From morning to noon, it fluctuated by no more than six taels, and trading was slow. This is likely because the foreign exchange rate is stable, the silver market is inactive, and although U.S. stocks rose, there was no impact. The opening was high, but later, due to buyer activity, it briefly exceeded 780 taels before falling back, with only one or two taels of fluctuation. Finally, it was above 78 taels. The afternoon market was closed due to Saturday. It is recalled that the situation had been quite good this week, with the lowest price being 756 taels in the early morning of Monday, and the highest being 85 taels and a half the next day, a difference of 29 taels and 5 qian. Overall, September has seen a rise of about 24 taels, which is considered significant.</p>
<p>October Trading Starts Upward</p>
<p>The opening price for October was 776 taels. Large silver bars showed no price changes. Private telegrams were at 1/16, so sentiment seemed good. Later, due to sales by Yifengyong, Tong Taichang, and Richang, the price fell to 74 taels and 8 qian. Soon after, goods for hedging and Cuichang Yongyu, Dazhifengyong, etc., entered the market. Banks also engaged in forward British gold transactions at 5625, with recent transactions at half a penny. At 9:01, it jumped six taels to 80 taels and 8 qian. However, Shunli Yongfeng, Wanxing Zhifengyong, and Yifengyong resumed selling, especially HSBC, which sold September at half a penny, causing the price to drop to 77 taels. The British gold announcement remained unchanged, at 77 taels and 5 qian. The U.S. dollar was listed at a small 125, followed by 8 taels and 12 qian, which then retreated to 7 taels and 45 qian. Qian Changxiang, Yuanchun, and retail investors bought in, reaching 79 taels at 10:15. Afterward, it fluctuated around 78 taels until 11:30, when the Indian exchange rate reported a small anna, but the forward rate was a large anna. At that time, it returned from 78 taels and 6 qian to 7 taels and 7 qian. Transaction volume on the floor was small, and Indian exchange bills were also stable. At the noon close, it was 78 taels and a half, about 4 taels higher than the previous day after deducting the 3 taels for the futures spread. The maximum fluctuation for the half-day was 10 taels and 8 qian, and the minimum was 74 taels and 8 qian, a difference of 6 taels.</p>
<p>Spot Price Adds Seven Taels</p>
<p>Goods opened early at 5 taels and 8 qian and closed at noon at 8 taels and 8 qian. The listed price was still 819 taels, about 41 taels lower. August accounts have been cleared, September is 76 taels, October is 79 taels, water compensation is 76 taels, and the spot silver bar price has increased by about 7 taels due to the futures spread. Yingfengheng bought several hundred taels, and Tianjin and other groups went to Yingfengheng Dafengheng to handle 2,000 taels of forward contracts.</p>
<p>Transaction Volume Not Large</p>
<p>Floor transaction statistics show that Cuichangyong, Zhifengyong, Yuda, and Goods entered the market. Yuantai, Futaiheng, Yuandayong, Hengyu, and Fuyu had mixed entries and exits. Yifengyong and Qian Changxiang sold early and bought in the afternoon. Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, and Yuanxingyong all sold. A speculator named Wu sold a small amount. The Dalian group had a total of eight or nine hundred bars in and out. The Guangdong group still had no trading, only eight or nine hundred bars of futures trading.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Foreign Exchange Market Trend Stable <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets did not change. The market was sluggish. The Shanghai market was slightly better. The HSBC listing only reduced the US dollar by 125, totaling 29 yuan. The rest of the market was stable. Banks also quoted a small 125 for buying four-month contracts. The domestic market was initially firm and then stable, with minimal fluctuations. As a result, British gold was down 0625, US dollars were down 125, and Japanese gold was up half a cent. The gold futures market for October has begun, and prices have rebounded and strengthened, hovering around the 80-tael mark. In the afternoon, because it was Saturday, there was no market as usual, and Chinese merchants' transactions were not smooth. Only 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded, with some settlements. Interbank transactions were not quiet, with HSBC selling positions. There were very few transactions in US and Japanese exchange rates. The market situation was stable.</p>
<p>British Exchange Rate: Domestic market fluctuated only .0625. The morning bid was one shilling two and a half pence to five six two five, with forward rates from five six two five to six two five. Buying prices all added .0625. Hefeng initially offered half a penny for October. Mackrow &amp; Co. and Mitsui did a deal for November at five six two five. Mackrow &amp; Co. also offered five six two five. Yuli countered Hefeng at half a penny for September.

<p>Prices Remain Sluggish, Continuing to Show Slight Increases Compared to Before</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond spot market remained deserted, with only 3,500 yuan traded throughout the day. The futures market was also quieter than before, totaling over 7.9 million yuan. The consolidated tax bonds still had over 2.6 million, the 20-year Customs bonds were less than 2 million, and the others were even quieter, with mostly scattered transactions. The market became increasingly sluggish. As a result, although all continued to rise, the increases were generally only one or two jiao.

<p>The yarn market is slightly firmer, with a slight upward trend. This is because coarse yarn sales are more active, with Yunnan and Sichuan groups purchasing, and there should be a rebound after the sharp decline. However, it is difficult to be optimistic about the global cotton industry, and a small fluctuation may be necessary at present.</p>
<p>Manbiao Rises Slightly: The Manbiao market opened with slightly lower U.S. cotton prices, and sentiment was flat and weak. Later, the news on spot yarn was not bad, and each month rose slightly by 1, 2, 3, or 4 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Yunnan and Sichuan groups had a significant number of coarse yarn transactions, and the market sentiment rebounded, with each month rising by 2, 4, 5, or 7 qian, to 1 tael 1 or 2 qian. The transaction volume was 34,250 bales. It was found that Xincheng sold 1,300 bales, Yongfeng 1,600 bales, Shenchang 800 bales, Mingde 850 bales, Xinchang 450 bales, and Heshen 450 bales. Yongfeng bought 1,850 bales, Daji 1,350 bales, Changfeng 1,200 bales, Houfengchang 850 bales, and Gengfeng 850 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>October 152.9, Up 10/98,400; January 153.4, Up 7/63,500</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Slightly Active: Spot yarn sales are more active. It was found that various groups bought a total of 3,200 bales throughout the day. The same industry bought 350 bales, and the market price was slightly firmer. Among the outside groups, Sichuan bought 1,300 bales, Yunnan bought 350 bales, the Northern group bought 100 bales, Guangdong bought 760 bales, the Mainland bought 135 bales, Shantou bought 155 bales, Gaoyang bought 150 bales, Jiangxi bought 125 bales, Zhenjiang bought 100 bales, and miscellaneous groups bought 100 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market situation is stable, as this phenomenon should occur after a sharp decline. However, U.S. and Indian cotton trends are not weak. Actions to destroy new cotton may not become a reality, and people are uneasy. However, the general retail investors and mainland groups have already seen the domestic disaster situation and are not releasing their purchased cotton due to the expected reduction in cotton production. The future situation has great changes.</p>
<p>Hanbiao Stable: The Hanbiao market opened with slightly lower U.S. cotton prices, and sentiment was relatively stable. Each month rose slightly by 5 fen. The afternoon was flat. The transaction volume was 88,300 dan. Dafu sold 4,600 dan, Hengyi 2,600 dan, Daji 2,900 dan, Shenchang 1,400 dan, Changfeng 1,300 dan, Lichang 2,600 dan, Yongfeng 3,200 dan, Taichang 2,100 dan, and Deji 2,700 dan. Jifeng bought 3,800 dan, Yongfeng 3,500 dan, and Changhe 3,400 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hanbiao Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, Inventory Count: November 3415, Up 15/292,100</p>

<p>October 3410, Up 15/178,500; January 3400, Up 1/168,400</p>
<p>No Demand for Spot Cotton: There are no spot cotton transactions. According to experienced cotton merchants, regardless of poor circumstances in the past, Chinese and foreign manufacturers would purchase some forward contracts for new cotton. However, this year there is a great lack, and they have all disappeared, indicating that Chinese and foreign manufacturers have a bearish outlook. This is due to the unfavorable global trend.</p>

<p>U.S. Cotton Bull Positions Closed: Yesterday, U.S. cotton was weak initially due to poor Liverpool news, then firmed due to reactive buying, and finally weakened again due to the closing of bull positions. Futures fell by 7 to 10 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 3 points, and spot prices rose by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 15 points. The Indian cotton market was quiet and stable. Pingguoer fell by 3.5 rupees, Aomula fell by 4.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (14th dispatch):</p>

<p>Washington dispatch, 14th: The Department of Agriculture's plan to destroy one-third of the new cotton crop seems likely to fail because, according to unofficial indications, seven of the fourteen provinces do not approve, three provinces approve, and the remaining four provinces have not expressed an opinion.</p>
<h3 id="e201">U.S. Cotton Rises After Initial Drop Last Week <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Production Destruction Plan Seems Difficult to Achieve</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 14th reported on the cotton market during the week: The government's cotton production estimate reached 15,584,000 bales, which was beyond the expectations of the public. As a result, everyone tended to sell, and the closing of bull positions was particularly strong. However, when prices fell, it attracted buying by the same industry and short covering, which may slightly prevent further market crashes. Afterward, market sentiment became more stable because market prices were actually too low, and the new crop was still not out of danger. In the current situation, with the new cotton production quantity added, the rollover number can reach at least 24,500,000 bales, so those who buy at higher values are undoubtedly timid. The public deeply believes that the new crop will progress smoothly this month. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics' proposal to destroy one-third of the cotton crop caused a temporary disturbance and enabled short covering. However, the industry is doubtful about the success of its plan. There is very little hedging in the South, and perhaps they will bear the burden of allocation before the new crop is harvested.

<p>South Market: Sources from various groups continue to connect, about nearly 40 firms. The port storage is slightly available, and the market is feeling more active. Changxi Northern Japonica and Suping White Japonica rice prices are called up by one chi. Thin rice and Luyang sharp rice follow the hard chi, and Pinghu rice has no demand at all, tending toward a downward spiral. Foreign rice sources are lacking, and outside groups are still resolving their stock, with the market trend initially weak and then strategic.</p>
<p>Zhabei: In the morning, those approaching the market are extremely enthusiastic, but the buying trend is not smooth. Hou Jing, early and late rice from the village groups sold 500 shi, and the situation improved by 2 chi. Foreign Dujian and Bu Jian become increasingly tight. Not much arrives from inland. Due to silver constraints, people's hearts are tight. Glutinous rice is sold as soon as it arrives, and the market moves close to chi. The trend of new Hexia rice is slightly softer than before.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Foreign Rice Continues to Fall <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Only This Street Slightly Handles... Price Down Another Two Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was even worse. The sales route to outside groups completely stopped. Tianjin groups and scattered customers did not ask about it. Fixed prices continued to fall by a small amount. One Saigon was offered at seven taels, but it was still difficult to match the Shanghai market. However, the number previously set was very large. In addition to those already arriving, more will be arriving continuously. Those who set the price in other ports will also arrive. Moreover, after the recent frantic buying, appetites are also satisfied. Therefore, everyone's hearts are bearish, and they dare not handle too much. The actual retail sales on this street are also sluggish. Only those on this street who are thinking about doing business slightly handled it, and the price fell by another two jiao. Annam Japonica was offered at 250 bags, at a price of 15 yuan 5 jiao. Mindang rice was offered at 500 bags, at a price of 13 yuan 8 jiao. One Saigon was offered at 100 bags, at a price of 14 yuan 7 jiao and a half. Hong Kong rice was offered at 500 bags, at a price of 14 yuan 6 jiao and a half, and substandard rice was offered at 13 yuan 7 jiao and a half. Small Jiaomi was offered at 300 bags, at a price of 13 yuan 6 jiao and a half. Qieladi was offered at 500 bags, at a price of 13 yuan 7 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Flour Market Ends Well <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed a trend of initial flatness followed by a beautiful appearance. The quotation for foreign wheat had decreased by about one or two jiao. However, most manufacturers' thoughts were that various places were suffering from floods, and the disaster situation was severe, so the attitude of the mainland groups was always very smooth in purchasing, so most were temporarily waiting and suspended sales. Recently, due to disaster relief sales, there was a slight increase, while the future was rarely moving. Due to the manufacturers' wait-and-see attitude, the market was active for those outside the industry, so each month was beautiful again. As a result, this month was up 1 fen and 2.5 li compared to the previous day, September was good by 1.5 fen, October was good by 1.75 li, November was good by 1.5 fen, December was good by 1.75 li, and January was good by 1.5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Both Futures and Spot Wheat Show Stable Trend <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month generally showed a firm and stable trend. Although the quotation for foreign wheat was still slightly lower, the foreign wheat in the hands of short accounts was inevitably unprofitable due to the continuous sharp decline, so they all tended to wait and see and were unwilling to easily sell. With the scarcity of sellers, buyers seemed to be firmer again, so the opening prices for each month were all stable and beautiful, improving by four or five fen compared to the previous day's closing price. There is no hope for over-涨 in the future because the source of foreign wheat has not been cut off after all. As a result, this month was better by 1 fen compared to the previous day, September was better by 4 fen, October was better by 5 fen, November and December were better by 4 fen. The spot wheat market situation still appears stable, with a low source of arrival and a thin bottom. However, the factory appetite is still dull, and more than 2,600 bags of Kai Shan, Shuangfeng, Fangtai, Haining, and Taicang wheat were handled by Fuxin Huafeng.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Sugar Market Raw and White Sugar Prices Slightly Rise <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market report from the production area indicated that the spot price of Cuban sugar remained at 1.50, the New York futures price for September was 1.41, December was 1.43, March of next year was 1.46, May was 1.52, the spot price of Javanese sugar was 8 guilders, and the futures price for August and September was 6.875. There was no change from the previous prices. The association's market assessment indicated sluggish sales and few transactions, but the market sentiment remained firm. Dutch sugar No. 24 raw white sugar traded at a price increase of 11 taels and 6 mace, No. 20 medium white sugar at 11 taels, Cuban red sugar at 10 taels, and Dutch red No. 8 at 9 taels and 4.5 mace. The market situation was still quite firm. Taikoo Sugar CW was at 11 taels and 9.5 mace, DY at 11 taels, 9 mace, and 2.5 fen, HM at 11 taels, 4 mace, and 7.5 fen, and HX at 11 taels and 8.5 mace. Not much was being released, and the market appeared slightly better. Forward sales of Dutch sugar, Huaxin cargo, August and September shipment, Dutch red No. 8, were priced at 5 yuan plus new tax. However, dealers considered the foreign exchange rate to be too high, and previous inventories were quite large, so most of them showed little interest in purchasing, resulting in no transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Silk and Tea New York Cantonese Silk Prices Still Weak <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Exchange Rate Declines, Apparently Rising But Secretly Weak</p>
<p>The New York market's raw silk market has recently shown no sign of recovery. Japanese silk competition remains strong, and prices are becoming cheaper. Cantonese silk mills remain hesitant to purchase. Although prices rose on Wednesday, the exchange rate declined, resulting in an apparent rise but a hidden weakness. Fine grade Cantonese silk was quoted at $1.85 per pound, and coarse grade at $1.37 (US dollars). Transactions remain scarce, it is said.</p>

Tea market prices also rose uniformly, ranging from four or five taels to over ten taels. Among them, Ping-Shui Big Batch was particularly lively due to active sales to American firms. Goods arriving were quickly sold without delay. Foreign firms were even placing advance orders with Chinese merchants, and the market situation was exceptionally firm. Other teas such as Zhen Mei, Zhen Mei, and Xiu Mei also saw prices rise with no declines, it is said.</p>
