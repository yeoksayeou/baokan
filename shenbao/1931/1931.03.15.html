<p>有些人以爲革命并不需要甚麽黨只要農工商學聯合起來所謂揭竿而起挺身而鬥就可以成功革命的事業了這種思想我敢説在時代上己經是落伍的了歴史上固然也有過這種革命運動但有幾次是成功了的呢在農村經濟或手工業經濟的社會組織時代尙不能成功難道説到科學世界的現代社會還能實現嗎三十年前義和圑之失敗就是一個很明白的例證我們認爲凡屬革命事業必須先有合乎時代需要的主義聯合信仰同一主義的人組織一個嚴密的黨革命才有成功的希望否則散沙一盤决没有不失敗的試看一看歐洲大戰以後的地圖吧從前亡了國現在復興的從前衰弱現在强盛的像波蘭土耳其等都是因爲有黨的緣故至於意大利的法西斯蒂黨蘇俄的共産黨都是因爲先有强同的黨去領導革命興建設方有今日的成功</p>
<p>然而中國國民黨與意之法西斯蒂黨俄之共産黨也是不相同的他們主張一黨專政中國國民黨則只主張以黨訓政到了憲政時期便將政權授給全國人民民選的政府這在總理手訂的建國大綱上己明白規定了可是剛在建國障碍掃除之餘人民政治知議能力尙未能運用其選舉罷官創制複决四權的時亿一方面本黨當乘黨命歷史的使命訓導人民行使政權同時代表人民執行政權以鎭壓反動而完成訓政的責任</p>
<p>東北界於赤白兩大帝國主義之間北有蘇俄南有日本他挾着政治經濟的勢力侵入腹地無異共管即總理所謂次殖民地兄弟去年曾經説過救中國先要救東北救東北非要日俄將在東北覇佔的所謂特殊利益完全放棄不可因爲國境之内無論任何地方一有帝國主義的勢力存在便不能算獨立平等的國家這是單就外交方面而論若以中國國民經濟的力量來購即可更覺寒心了在歐美産業發　的國家他們所感困難的只是分配不均的問題而我國則是生産的問題因爲我國生産機關非常腐　生産能力非常薄弱所有一切生産的组織尙不能脱歐洲中古時代之狀態人民日常生活所需的一切大部份仰給於外國最可笑的就是數千年號稱以農立國的中國現在源源不絶的輸入大景的日本米和美國麥其他衣服住宅所用的材料凡在都市上所見的無一不是外國貨至於鋼鐵電氣等類更不用説了外國人有句護銷中國的話説「中國的消費是世界最新最大的中國的生産是世界最舊最低的」我們能够否認囑要發展國民的經濟須首先開發東北和西北總理在建國方略上也曾鄭重的説過兄弟以爲從交通與外交上着眼開發東北比較尤便利而迫切</p>
<p>總之我們要中國獨立平等要中國國民經濟的問題得到圓满的解决應當集合全國人民的心思財力首先來開發東北不久東四省的黨部都要成立了希望東北的同志與同胞同在青天白日旗幟之下向着三民主義的光明大道上走共同來完成救國建國的使命（完）</p>

<p>葡人之負於樂華任何人所不信而竟見諸事實可謂不測之風雲焉雖然就其諸列塲諸將之實力而言所勝於樂華者亦復無幾滬上著名之中堅谷斯坦因守門無人起而代之内衛馬賽兒及左右翼葛悌士賴遜爲葡軍之危險人物三球出於法凡却脚下亦得諸他將之助初遭二球之失後連三元超出於前大有保住勝利之趨勢乃竟又失兩球終致敗挫賽不勝有滄海之瑛矣</p>

<p>— 事實</p>
<p>招商局新昌輪觸礁損失達一百餘萬元甚屬大不幸事其情事己誌報端茲將關於此事之小消息分述一二如後</p>
<p>▲擱在兵艦上　新昌觸礁之地距馬鞍山六七里距泗礁山一里在黄龍山北鼎山之間地名愛立得礁適居四山之中先船頭套進礁石而後引擎間破全船燈息數十年前我國第一艘巡洋艦海天號（較海圻尤巨）即沉在該處今茲新昌失事適擱於海天艦沉没艦身之上新昌吃水十八英尺船底頂住在海天之烟囱與領江台上其能經一日一夜未即沉没者即海天抬捧之力也直至四十八小時以後船頭始入海中艙破裂全身沉没僅有一烟囱露出海面</p>
<p>▲各船員浮海　船上理貨部職員唐日華等二十五人在失事後先放船板四艘入海逃生黑夜孤舟行於驚濤駭浪中危險可知不意船板上未備划槳此二十五人被海浪盪激己無法主持聽其隨波逐流漂泊海面正危急間得怡和廣生輪到由其船主發見奮力打撈二十五人得全數生還</p>
<p>▲秃頭與赤足　七時五分觸礁九時即電燈盡息船内職工共有一百十二人當時只圖求生紛趨艙面搶舢板一時失鞋落帽者咸皆不顧亦有己經入艙因無事備臥者倉卒起床並衣服亦不及穿分四批逃上愛立得島與泗礁山在山挨餓二十四小時各人多半單衣飢寒交逼其慘苦有不忍言者各人到滬時狼狽己極現局中允每人給四十元予以補助</p>
<p>▲損失之巨大　新昌爲招商第一海輪船身鋼鐵最爲上等價值八十萬兩香港政府騐船最嚴船體稍舊即不許開往而准許載旅客入香港者須特堅之頭等輪方能前往新昌即可以載客至香港者其佳可知而機件之好尤占第一今次單就運貨費用言約損失二十萬合船身與船員物件行李計約損失一百三十萬元</p>
<p>▲書册亦搶光　輪船於失事以後捕漁船認爲唯一應享之利新昌觸礁後之第二日即有漁船四隻開往將船内公私物件銀錢全數搜刦外更將船主室頭等艙内特備之各種洋文書籍賬房内之賬册又船主大二副用之特種江海名貴航行地圖等價值極大者亦一并刦去苟不派海軍保護恐引擎機器亦被拆去矣</p>

<p>Chongguang proposes negotiations, but we consistently refuse. Nanjing: The Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee has decided to adopt a principle of equal treatment for the consolidation of debts without collateral. However, the Nishihara loan among the Japanese debts, due to its nature of promoting internal unrest in China, has long been denied. The Japanese chargé d'affaires, Mamoru Shigemitsu, has repeatedly come to Beijing to discuss resolving the loan, but we have consistently refused. It is heard that Shigemitsu is still working hard on it. According to those familiar with the situation of national debts, there are six types of Nishihara loans, totaling 120 million Japanese yen, all borrowed in the seventh year of the Republic (1918). At that time, the market value of Japanese yen was very low, and in fact, only 60 million Chinese currency was obtained. Now, the market value of Japanese yen is about two Chinese yuan for every Japanese yen. Just in terms of principal, it has already exceeded more than doubled, which is shocking. No matter how they lobby or voluntarily give up some, we will never accept their conditions to increase unjustifiable burdens. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>The opposition party's fight with the government in the current Japanese parliament is mostly about personnel issues. It began because Prime Minister Hamaguchi was wounded in an assassination attempt and was unable to attend parliament due to illness. Foreign Minister Shidehara acted as Prime Minister, but the opposition party argued that Shidehara, as a non-party member, could not take responsibility for a party cabinet and attend parliament. After several twists and turns, this issue passed. Then, a new wave was triggered by Shidehara's slip of the tongue during questioning in parliament. Members of the two parties even engaged in a brawl. After consultations between the leaders of the two parties, Shidehara admitted his slip of the tongue, and the matter ended. After the slip of the tongue issue passed, Prime Minister Hamaguchi's injuries gradually recovered, and he had to personally attend parliament to deal with the difficult situation. At the beginning of his attendance, the opposition party, considering that Prime Minister Hamaguchi's injuries had just healed, wanted to show a gentlemanly and chivalrous demeanor and did not want to make things too difficult during questioning. The situation of the political struggle slightly eased. But today, they are again attacking the government with the issue of Hamaguchi's health. Furthermore, because Prime Minister Hamaguchi insisted on attending on the 12th, but only attended the House of Peers for a little over an hour on the 13th, and did not attend the budget meeting, there is a strong intention to maintain his position as Prime Minister to pass this session of parliament. The opposition party could no longer bear it and took the second stage of active efforts to overthrow the cabinet. Looking at the above points, the political struggle in the current Japanese parliament is mostly focused on the issue of personnel, and there is very little contact regarding political views.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Japanese Parliament About to End <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Many bills are pending, and the government is unable to handle them. The Seiyukai is actively pursuing a no-confidence motion against the cabinet. There is a strong anti-government atmosphere in the House of Peers, and Kato, the Secretary-General of the House, resigned in anger over the revival of the South Choseon Provincial Office relocation fee. Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The current parliamentary session has only a few days left, with the 15th and 22nd being Sundays and the 21st being a festival, so the parliament will only be in session for five or six days. However, in addition to this year's budget, many important bills are piled up. The government is now focusing on the Prime Minister's health and has no idea how to handle these cases. The Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The Seiyukai believes that questioning the Prime Minister, who is weakened after his illness, would lose public sympathy, and that if Prime Minister Hamaguchi resigns before the budget is passed in the House of Peers, the Minseito may be able to maintain power, so they are waiting quietly while monitoring the government and the party's attitude. Prime Minister Hamaguchi insisted on attending the 13th on the 12th, but only attended the plenary session of the House of Peers for about an hour, and did not attend the budget committee either, with the intention of maintaining his position as Prime Minister and getting through the parliamentary session. The Seiyukai could no longer tolerate this, and all the executives unanimously advocated adopting the second stage of actively pursuing a no-confidence motion.</p>
<p>The Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 14th: Yesterday, when the House of Peers voted on the budget for the relocation fee of the South Choseon Provincial Office in Korea, it was decided to revive it with an unexpectedly large margin of 103 votes, which proves the anti-government attitude of the House of Peers. The government-affiliated and neutral members of the House of Peers resented the government for not expressing its willingness to hold a joint conference of both houses and for indicating that it would not recognize the request for revival, so the number of votes in favor of revival increased. Therefore, the decision to revive with such a large margin is evidence of the general dissatisfaction of the House of Peers with the government's attitude, and this anti-government atmosphere will inevitably have a considerable impact on the deliberation of important bills in the future.</p>
<p>The Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 14th: Kato Choichi, a young member of the Minseito, believes that the revival of the relocation fee for the South Choseon Provincial Office is a contempt for the resolution of the House of Representatives and has expressed his anger. He has submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Hamaguchi and will no longer serve as Secretary-General. Kazami Akira and Okano Kyobe also requested to resign from their positions as House of Peers executives.</p>

<h3 id="e67">India to Resist Foreign Salt <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan advocates increasing import tariffs. Reuters, New Delhi, 13th: Members of the Legislative Yuan today advocated immediately increasing the tariff on salt imported into British India by four and a half annas per 80 pounds, and also advocated that if the price of foreign salt falls further, the government has the right to increase this tariff by another anna. Britain invites the US and Japan to join.</p>
<h3 id="e68">New Naval Treaty Drafting Committee <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Japan makes new demands regarding submarine holdings. Associated Press, Washington, 13th: The State Department today received a letter from the British Foreign Office requesting that it send representatives to join the formal committee for the French-Italian naval treaty. Secretary of State Stimson stated that the United States has not yet decided whether to accept this invitation. It is widely believed that the government will accept it, but the United States will send expert representatives rather than diplomatic representatives, so Ambassador Dawes will not be involved in the committee's affairs. Japan has reportedly received the same invitation. It is widely rumored in Europe that the five-nation treaty will replace the 1930 London Naval Treaty. However, the US State Department has expressed its opposition, as the new treaty must be approved by the Senate, which would inevitably lead to another debate in the legislature.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 13th: Secretary of State Stimson stated that the French-Italian naval agreement is not directly related to the United States and that he does not see any reason why the United States should sign it. He seems to imply that the United States may not sign the new British-French-Italian naval treaty.</p>
<p>World Press states that according to the Oriental Daily News, regarding the naval agreement between Britain, France, and Italy, which has been largely concluded, the three governments have informally announced that the Japanese government has also had considerable discussions within the Ministry regarding the submarine holdings of France and Italy. Some argue that at this time, it is necessary to anticipate future disarmament conferences and consider what measures to take. Regardless of whether the British-French-Italian agreement is denied or the British-French-Italian agreement is immediately applied to Article 20 of the British-American-Japanese agreement, the balance of power with the British-American-Japanese holdings of 52,200 tons is too much. It is believed that it is possible to submit a request to increase Japan's submarine holdings at the future disarmament conference. After the Navy and Foreign Ministries discuss the results and decide to adopt this policy, it will be submitted for approval and diplomatic measures will be taken with the countries concerned.</p>
<h3 id="e69">French Parliament Trusts Current Cabinet <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Budget passed by the Chamber of Deputies, political atmosphere gradually clarifies. National News Agency, Paris, 13th: Parliament today passed the budget with a majority vote. Before the budget was passed, Parliament had passed a vote of confidence in the Laval cabinet by 340 votes to 215, so the political atmosphere has become clearer. Furthermore, Parliament has been in session for 27 hours continuously, with very little rest time, so even the most radical members of the Socialist and Communist parties no longer object to the Sky Aviation Company case.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 13th: The Chamber of Deputies today passed the budget by 460 votes to 120. When the bill was introduced on Wednesday, the Finance Minister stated that there would be a shortfall of 20 billion francs by the end of the fiscal year at the end of March and warned against overspending on social programs such as unemployment relief and old-age pensions. On Thursday, the Chamber of Deputies Finance Committee passed two important amendments: one stipulated that the material and construction budgets of the army and navy should be reduced by 2%, and the other stipulated that the reduction of the long-term trading tax in the stock exchange should be abolished. According to this calculation, the estimated shortfall of 20 billion francs will be changed to a surplus of 21 million francs. Yesterday, the government failed in the Chamber of Deputies with a vote of 325 to 245 on an amendment to improve the promotion treatment of primary school teachers. If this amendment were passed, it would increase political expenses by 200 million francs. Although the government failed, it did not mean resignation because the Prime Minister did not consider this a matter of confidence.</p>

<p>Caval will succeed as Secretary of War. National News Agency, Madrid, 13th: Today, the Spanish Cabinet discussed the resignation of General Berenguer, the Secretary of War, and decided to recommend General Caval, the commander of the Andalusia province, to succeed him. Berenguer was the former Prime Minister and only joined the current cabinet after repeated persuasion. Now he is resigning due to illness.</p>

<p>To prevent unrest. Associated Press, Havana, 13th: The Cuban government today proposed restoring the political peace plan. The authorities stated that they will take severe steps in the future to deal with those who plot to resist the state. Criminals will be detained to allow them to change their ways, and those with more serious circumstances will be severely punished. In the past, political prisoners who were arrested were only detained for a certain period of time and then released without trial. Recently, revolutionary students have frequently launched riots, and the police are unable to prevent them, so they want to stop the unrest with severe punishments.</p>

The ship he took this time, the "Deutschland," was also blocked by wind and waves. In advance, Einstein used wireless to decline all receptions. The scientific community is eager to know whether there will be any changes to his theory of relativity after Einstein observed celestial phenomena at the Wilson Mountain Observatory in California.</p>

The text stated: "In order to implement the order, according to the report of the Judicial Yuan, regarding the reply to the document from the Civil Affairs Office of the government on the 21st of this month (No. 1500), the 11th meeting of the National Government decided to hand over to the Judicial Yuan, etc. the report submitted by the Executive Yuan based on the request of the Fujian Provincial Government to cancel the arrest warrant for Lin Chimin, the former member of the Provincial Government. The Yuan hereby orders that the case be investigated. The Yuan hereby informs you that the arrest warrant for Lin Chimin, the former member of the Provincial Government, was issued by the National Government to the former Ministry of Justice for trial and investigation due to the shooting of Xie Shouqiu. The original file was consulted and reviewed, and according to the report of the special investigator Peng Chengwan, the cause of the incident was due to the local parties competing for political power. Xie Shouqiu was arrested because he urgently wanted to escape and fired a shot to scare away the people, which led to his arrest on the spot. There is no concrete evidence that it was under the instigation of Lin Chimin, etc. As a result of the meeting of the Provincial Government Committee, Lin Chimin did not have any special opinion in the vote at the scene. Since the Provincial Government has reported that it is a real situation, it seems that the request to cancel the arrest warrant in accordance with the case of Huang Zhanyun can be approved. The Ministry hereby reports for review, etc. Based on this, the 13th meeting of the National Government decided to approve the cancellation of the arrest warrant. In addition to the instructions and distribution, the Ministry hereby orders you to investigate."</p>

<h3 id="e81">Han Fuqu Tours Northern Shandong <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, has decided to tour the entire province to inspect the military. Today (the 12th) at 10:01 AM, Han took a special train. The special train prepared by the Jiaoji Railway was not used, and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway prepared three carriages (Nos. 128, 21, and 116), one third-class carriage, three flatcars, nine covered cars, one guard car, and the locomotive was No. 623 of the Peiping-Hankou Railway. In addition to the heads of departments of the General Headquarters, the accompanying personnel included Li Tianni, Director of the Inspection Department of the Provincial Government; Zhuang Shouzhong, Secretary; Kong Xiangwu, staff member; Lu Junyan and Song Ziran, clerks; Chen Jingru, staff member of the Civil Affairs Department; Wang Chengxun, Inspector of the Finance Department; Zhou Yanguang, Instructor of the Education Department; Hu Xuejian, technician of the Construction Department; and Li Tingwei, Inspector of the Agriculture and Mining Department. There was also a battalion of guards, which was the first battalion of a pistol brigade. Li Zongbi, Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters, and Sun Tongxuan, Commander of the 20th Division, and others saw him off at the station. Han told people that in addition to inspecting party affairs and politics in the counties during this tour, he would also inspect the local garrisons and people's armies in preparation for future reorganization. The train will stop at Yucheng Plain to inspect before going directly to Dezhou. According to Li Shuchun, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, the first task of the Chairman's tour is to inspect party affairs and politics (according to the Provincial Reorganization Committee's recent decision to recommend Han to inspect party affairs in the counties), and he will pay special attention to the water security along the coast and rivers. This trip will go from Dezhou to Binli to inspect the river and sea terrain and defenses. After returning to Jinan, he will go from the Xiaoqing River to Yangjiaogou to inspect the coastal defense of Shouguang and Guangrao. In recent years, disasters have occurred frequently in this province, and there has been no time to pay attention to coastal defense. The Yangjiaogou Chamber of Commerce has already raised a special fund of about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan to purchase two small steamers and install machine guns for patrolling the rivers and seas. After the Chairman's inspection, this matter may be seen.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Tianjin Airplane Arrives in Jinan from Peiping <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Aviation Company establishes a resident office in Jinan. Jinan Correspondence: The "Tianjin" airplane, which was test-flown from Peiping to Jinan, passed through Jinan to Tianjin and back to Peiping a few days ago. Today (12th) at 10:30 AM, the original airplane was flown directly from the north by Nie Kaiyi, Deputy Director of the Air Navigation Group, and four others. It landed at the Zhangzhuang Airport in Jinan. Nie and others stayed at the Jinan Hotel. Nie told reporters that he flew out of Peiping at 8:30 AM today. After entering Shandong Province, the sky was filled with yellow dust. After flying in the sky for about ten minutes after arriving in Jinan, he saw the airport and landed. Wang Zhenxiang, a radio engineer who was traveling with him, stayed in Peiping. This time, the pilots Zhang Huayi, the mechanics Yu Yongquan and Yu Shiping, and four brothers came. The results of this test flight were excellent. The Peiping-Jinan route will be officially opened on the first of next month. Two airplanes will be used in the future. One will fly north from the capital and the other will fly south from Peiping at 8:01 AM every day, and they can arrive at 3 or 4 PM.

The office is located in the YMCA. It is reported that Nie and his party are scheduled to return to Beijing tomorrow (12th).</p>
<h3 id="e83">Qingdao Municipal Government Reorganizes Municipal Property <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since the receipt of the land and real estate owned by the city of Qingdao, the Qingdao Municipal Government has followed the old rules of previous administrations without reorganizing it. As a result, there are many malpractices and citizens have complained. Now, in order to be cautious about the city's property and increase revenue, a reorganization plan has been drafted and submitted to the 81st Municipal Meeting for discussion and decision. The content is divided into two items: land and housing, which are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Land: In the past, the land rented out by the city was not made public. Secrecy breeds malpractices, and it is necessary to thoroughly publicize it to eliminate malpractices. The Finance Bureau has been ordered to draft rules for bidding for open land. The area and grade of the rented land will be announced in advance, and then citizens will bid for it. Public bidding will be used, and the highest bidder will be the tenant, eliminating the previous malpractices.</p>
<p>(2) Real Estate: In addition to the real estate sold by the Municipal Bureau during the German era, the city has more than 260 properties. Since the German operation, it has not been reorganized. The city government has decided on two methods: A. For those that should be repaired and rebuilt, three methods are formulated: 1. Those that are dilapidated and need to be repaired will be surveyed and estimated by the Finance Bureau, and the Municipal Government will allocate funds for repairs at any time. 2. Those that have collapsed and cannot be repaired and have no need for rebuilding will be estimated at a price and allowed to be purchased by citizens. The land will still be handled in accordance with the regulations for publicly rented land in the city. 3. For the city's property in prosperous areas, the original buildings should be rebuilt in order to revitalize the market and increase revenue, or citizens may undertake the construction and be responsible for the renovation. The property rights still belong to the city (the undertaking method will be stipulated separately). As for where repairs should be made, where sales can be made, and where renovations can be made by citizens themselves, the Finance Bureau will investigate and report to the Municipal Government for approval. B. For those that should be re-priced, the rent for the city's real estate was evaluated in 1924. Many years have passed and it should be re-evaluated. Now, all the city's property has been divided into areas, re-numbered, and maps have been drawn for easy investigation. At the same time, the price will be verified and the rent will be determined to increase revenue. Central agencies, local organizations, and other agencies that borrow it should also pay rent to show uniformity. For those used by the Japanese at that time, the rent was used to offset interest due to loan relations, and it should also be listed as income and expenditure for future reference. Other real estate along the Jiaoji Railway will be discussed with the Jiaoji Railway Bureau to exchange the city's houses with the bureau's houses for easy management. After the Finance Bureau drafts specific plans for the above two methods, they will be implemented step by step. (March 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Recent Situation in Western Sichuan <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Military Affairs received a report from Beijing. News from western Sichuan, being a remote border region, is quite scarce. Recently, the Ministry of Military Affairs received a report from the area detailing the social and commercial situation. The following is extracted for the reference of those concerned about western Sichuan:</p>
<p>(1) Administrative Scope: The Han army controls ten border counties in Sichuan and Gansu. The total area, with Songpan as the headquarters (Sichuan border), extends west to the Qinghai border and the Tibetan borders of Maogong, Lifan, Wenchuan, Weizhou, Maoxian, etc. (Gansu border) The area bordering Sichuan and Gansu includes Wenxian, Xigu, Taozhou, Minzhou, Daohe, etc., totaling ten counties.</p>
<p>(2) Regional Situation: The area currently held by the Han army is the center of the four provinces of Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai, and Tibet.</p>
<p>(3) Ethnic Groups: There are several types of Yi people. Due to the vastness of the border area, these people mostly live a scattered existence, with no fixed abode, dwelling in rock and forest. Furthermore, communication is obstructed, and culture is not easily introduced, leading to language barriers and making accurate surveys difficult.</p>
<p>(4) Industry Status: Zhangla in Songpan is a famous gold mountain, but unfortunately, primitive mining methods are used. It produces approximately 10,000 to 20,000 taels of gold annually. If machinery and new methods were used, the amount of gold mined would certainly increase many times over. Other resources, such as the copper mine on Gongkang Ridge, the iron mine at Fengdong Pass, and the coal mine at Sanshe, are all natural riches but are unexploited. Furthermore, the gold mines at Erkai, Songping, Manseergu, and the silver mine at Bipenggou are all closed due to the local Tibetan people's superstitious beliefs in Feng Shui, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>(5) Commercial Status: Because of the cold weather and barren land in the counties under its jurisdiction, agriculture is not very developed. Fortunately, Han and Tibetan people live together and trade with each other. Consequently, foreign merchants come here to trade in droves, especially from Shaanxi and Henan. Mutual trust is evident, and commerce is quite developed.</p>
<p>(6) People's Beliefs: The people of each county are Han, Hui, and Tibetan. Because of their different ethnicities, they have different beliefs. For example, mosques are built everywhere for Muslims to worship. Both Han and Tibetan people believe in Buddhism, especially the Tibetans, who are the most devout. There are large-scale Buddhist temples everywhere. Every three years, the living Buddhas from various places go to Tibet to pay homage to the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. When the Dalai Lama rebelled against China, he sent representatives to incite the Tibetan people to surrender to the British. Fortunately, in the 18th year of the Republic, Commander Yang arrived outside the pass at Damoa and convened a meeting of officials from various Tibetan tribes, explaining the greater meaning of the central government, instructing them to lean towards the central government and not surrender to British imperialism. All the officials respectfully obeyed. As for the Bo people (commonly called Bo Guozi), they are even more fierce than the Tibetans, delighting in robbery and killing.</p>
<p>(7) Customs and Habits: The customs and habits of the Tibetan people are very different from those of the Han people. Some tribal chiefs have held their positions since the Han and Tang dynasties. The local autonomous organization functions as follows: when an event occurs, the chiefs convene a meeting of the Tibetan people. First, a shaman speaks, expressing opinions, which are then voted on. Then, the strong men's meeting votes again. Finally, the elders' meeting makes the final decision, and then the chief executes it. Marriages often involve cattle and sheep as gifts. Funerals mostly use cremation. Muslim weddings do not involve welcoming the bride to the ancestral hall, and funerals do not use coffins, but rather the corpse is wrapped in cloth and carried for burial. Han people's coming-of-age, weddings, and funerals are the same as in other provinces. Bo people's marriages mostly result from robbery, and funerals also use cremation. (Daily News)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Details of the Verdict in the Ye Yixiong Case <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The case of Ye Yixiong, a candidate magistrate of the Special District Local Court, involving attempted murder and embezzlement, was publicly tried twice in the Criminal Court of the Shenyang Local Court. After the last debate concluded, the official verdict was pronounced on the 9th, sentencing the defendant to life imprisonment and depriving him of his civil rights for life. A brief report has already been published previously. The following details the circumstances of the verdict in the case:</p>
<p>The case, involving a judicial official as the perpetrator, had already attracted the attention of the legal community. The transfer of the case to Shenyang's jurisdiction further increased its gravity. Therefore, before the verdict was reached, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, Tang Yinfen, along with judges Yang Yangcheng and Li Hongwen, held a deliberation to jointly discuss opinions and carefully examine the defendant's confessions. The verdict was then submitted to the president of the court, Zhang Qihong, for review. The procedures for pronouncing the verdict were then completed. On the morning of the 9th, at 11:00 AM, the defendant Ye Yixiong was brought from the detention center to the court's waiting room. At 2:10 PM, the presiding judge Tang Yinfen, along with judges Yang Yangcheng and Li Hongwen, and official Jian Hongjun, clerk Wang Chan'gui, all arrived in court. The court police removed Ye's shackles and brought him to the First Civil Court to hear the verdict. Wang Ce'an, the lawyer defending Ye, also appeared in court. The case file was first handed to Ye to allow him to review the testimony for any errors before signing. During the hearing of the verdict, Ye's face changed, as if he were frightened. The audience in the gallery also sat upright, holding their breath and waiting. However, during this period, Ye nitpicked his previous statements, such as "October 5th is the death anniversary of her deceased husband." The original record of the fifth day was perhaps a mistake. There were also errors in other answers. The clerk corrected them one by one. After reading and signing, the presiding judge announced the official verdict. The presiding judge, the judges, the prosecutor, and the defense counsel all stood up. The presiding judge then held the verdict and read the main text, saying, "In the case of the defendant Ye Yixiong for attempted murder and embezzlement, the verdict is as follows: The defendant Ye Yixiong is sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder and embezzlement, and is deprived of his civil rights for life. For possessing military firearms and ammunition, he is sentenced to one year of imprisonment. The life sentence and deprivation of civil rights are to be executed." During the second public trial, Ye had requested the presiding judge not to impose or reduce the portion of the sentence that deprived him of his civil rights, because he had already anticipated that no matter how severe the crime he committed, there would come a day when he would be released and see the light of day again. At that time, the expiration of the deprivation of civil rights would allow him to practice law again. Unexpectedly, both the prison sentence and the deprivation of rights were for life. Upon hearing this, he could not help but take a deep breath of cold air. At the time, Presiding Judge Tang feared that he might not understand the main text clearly and explained it to him, saying that the other crimes had already been sentenced to life imprisonment, and that the possession of military firearms and ammunition could not be executed. Ye asked again on what grounds. The presiding judge said there were two reasons: (1) The defendant traveled by train from Harbin to Ping, and the journey was very safe. There was no need to carry a gun. The fact that he carried a gun without needing to, and that he did not have a gun license, or even knew the number of his old gun license, clearly showed that he had a premeditated plan to murder. (2) According to the defendant's confession, it was powerful evidence of premeditated murder. As the defendant confessed, "On the train, I saw a love letter in the suitcase that she had not sent to Liu Kelong. In it, there was 'The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming, have this mooncake,' etc. After reading it, I would kill her." The defendant, after seeing the letter on the train, did not shoot Zhang Liqing, but tricked her off the train and walked a long way, shooting her in a remote place. The time for consideration was enough to constitute premeditated murder. In addition, ordinary people are not allowed to carry guns and must have a gun license. The defendant carried a gun without a license, so according to the regulations on carrying military firearms and ammunition, he should be found guilty. Ye asked again whether embezzlement was also a crime. The presiding judge said that embezzlement was also established, but according to Article 74 of the Criminal Law, embezzlement was intentionally punished more severely, and he was not simply sentenced to imprisonment, but rather the crimes were combined. The presiding judge added that the defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment because the murder was only attempted, so the sentence was reduced by one-third. The verdict would be delivered to the defendant in the future. If the defendant did not agree, he could appeal to the High Court within ten days. At that time, Ye, upon hearing the verdict of life imprisonment, suddenly seemed dazed. He asked the presiding judge when the appeal should be made. The presiding judge said that the appeal could be filed after the verdict was delivered. Ye asked again whether he could appeal immediately. The presiding judge said that according to procedural law, the defendant could not appeal until he submitted a statement of appeal. At this point, Ye pondered for a long time without speaking. The presiding judge then announced the adjournment. Ye's face was pale, and he lowered his head and retreated. It is heard that Ye has decided to submit an appeal to the High Court within the deadline. (March 11)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Lecture on the Mission of the Kuomintang <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>Some people think that revolution does not need any party. As long as farmers, workers, merchants, and students unite and, so-called, rise up and fight, the revolutionary cause can succeed. I dare say that this kind of thinking is already outdated. Historically, there have been such revolutionary movements, but how many have succeeded? It could not succeed in the era of rural economy or handicraft economy. Can it be realized in the modern society of the scientific world? The failure of the Boxer Rebellion thirty years ago is a clear example. We believe that all revolutionary undertakings must first have an ideology that meets the needs of the times, unite people who believe in the same ideology, and organize a strict party before the revolution can succeed. Otherwise, a pile of loose sand is bound to fail. Just look at the map after the European war. Those that were formerly destroyed are now restored, and those that were formerly weak are now strong, such as Poland and Turkey, are all because they have parties. As for the Fascist Party of Italy and the Communist Party of Soviet Russia, they have succeeded today because they first had a strong party to lead the revolution and construction.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese Kuomintang is also different from the Italian Fascist Party and the Russian Communist Party. They advocate one-party dictatorship, while the Chinese Kuomintang only advocates using the party to govern until the constitutional period, when it will hand over power to the people of the whole country and the elected government. This is clearly stipulated in the Founding Program personally drafted by the Premier. However, just after the obstacles to nation-building have been removed, the people's political awareness and ability to exercise their four rights of election, recall, initiative, and referendum are not yet developed. On the one hand, the Party should take advantage of the historical mission of the Party to guide the people to exercise their political power. At the same time, it should represent the people and exercise their political power to suppress reactionaries and complete the responsibility of tutelage.</p>
<p>The Northeast is bordered by two major red and white imperialist powers, Soviet Russia in the north and Japan in the south. They encroach on the hinterland with political and economic power, which is tantamount to joint management, or what the Premier called a sub-colony. I said last year that to save China, we must first save the Northeast. To save the Northeast, Russia and Japan must completely abandon their so-called special interests in the Northeast, because as long as there is any imperialist power within the country, no matter where, it cannot be considered an independent and equal country. This is only in terms of diplomacy. If we use the power of the Chinese national economy to purchase it, we will feel even more discouraged. In European and American industrialized countries, the difficulty they feel is only the problem of uneven distribution, while in our country, it is the problem of production, because our production mechanisms are very corrupt, and our production capacity is very weak. All the organizations of production have not yet escaped the state of the European Middle Ages. Most of the daily necessities of the people depend on foreign countries. The most ridiculous thing is that China, which has been called an agricultural country for thousands of years, is now continuously importing Japanese rice and American wheat. As for the materials used for other clothes and houses, everything seen in the cities is foreign goods, not to mention steel and electricity. Foreigners have a saying to protect sales in China, saying, "China's consumption is the newest and largest in the world, and China's production is the oldest and lowest in the world." Can we deny that to develop the national economy, we must first develop the Northeast and Northwest? The Premier also solemnly said in the Founding Strategy that I believe that from the perspective of transportation and diplomacy, developing the Northeast is more convenient and urgent.</p>
<p>In short, if we want China to be independent and equal, and we want the problem of the Chinese national economy to be fully resolved, we should gather the minds and financial resources of the people of the whole country to first develop the Northeast. Soon, the Party headquarters in the four eastern provinces will be established. I hope that the comrades and compatriots in the Northeast will all walk under the banner of the Blue Sky, White Sun, towards the bright road of the Three Principles of the People, and jointly complete the mission of saving the country and building the nation.

<h3 id="e87">Zhejiang Province Maintains Construction Funding <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Construction funds must not be diverted without approval, and construction donations will continue to be collected as before. The Zhejiang Construction Department recently investigated the construction funds of various counties in Zhejiang Province and found that they were often diverted for other purposes without authorization. These diversions were nominally temporary loans but were actually entangled with other matters, with no definite repayment date. This made it impossible to determine the amount of funding available, and when matters needed to be handled, there were no funds to draw upon. This not only hampered construction but also disrupted public finances. It was therefore necessary to rectify and reorganize this situation. The Department therefore issued a joint order with the Finance Department to all counties yesterday, stating that all construction funds in each county, except for the budgeted expenditures, could not be diverted for other purposes without special approval. Those who had already diverted funds without authorization were given one month from the date of the order to repay the full amount. The counties whose funds had been handed over to the Financial Affairs Bureau for management were immediately ordered to instruct the county magistrates to work with the bureau chiefs to clear up the accounts within the prescribed time limit and ensure that the funds were kept in a special account without any shortage. Otherwise, they would be severely punished.</p>
<p>The Department also stated that since the implementation of the tax reduction in Zhejiang Province, all taxes similar to transit duties had been abolished by order. The impact of this had led to the suspension of construction donations that were previously collected independently by local authorities. Recently, the county magistrates had successively submitted requests for instructions on how to provide relief. After investigating this matter, it was found that these construction donations had been in place for many years, based on local real estate or goods as the standard, collected through local government agencies by entrusted merchants, and were completely different from transit duties collected by bureaus. Since they were neither within the scope of transit duties nor similar to them, their nature should be clarified and maintained so that local construction projects could be maintained in a normal state. A proposal was drafted and submitted to the 382nd meeting of the provincial government, which passed a resolution that all donations collected by various counties for construction purposes in the past would be allowed to continue to be collected as before. The provincial government issued an order to all counties yesterday to inform them of this decision.</p>

<p>The Steamed Bone Examination in the Hu Murder Case: The Hu family of Dawuqiao, Songjiang, was originally a prominent family in the county seat. Unfortunately, the Hu Yinglong murder case occurred last year. Zhang Zeyu, the brother of the wife, and others reported to the County Court Procuratorate that Hu Yinglong and his aunt Hu Nie smothered his sister to death and requested that justice be served. The defendant was arrested and went to the place where the coffin was placed and opened the coffin for inspection. The local coroner verified that there were finger marks on the neck, proving that she had been smothered to death, but the Western doctor hired by the informant believed that the death spots had contradictory opinions. The case was repeatedly tried, and a public prosecution was filed for the crime of premeditated murder. The defendant Hu Yinglong hired lawyer Zhang Baopei to defend him, and Gu Shouyi, a lawyer appointed by the court, defended Hu Nie pro bono. There was once a public trial, and the defendant's lawyer had many doubts about the contradiction between the coroner and the doctor's appraisal and requested a review to clarify the truth. The court approved, but the death had been several months, and the body should have rotted. It was necessary to conduct a steamed bone review. A verification site was set up at Longmen Temple in the South Gate, and various utensils for the steamed verification were prepared. Zhenjiang coroner Guo Chunrong was appointed to take charge. It was very secretive beforehand. Until yesterday, both parties were notified to conduct the review this morning (the 14th). Guo Li arrived in Songjiang yesterday. This morning at 8 o'clock, Prosecutor Li, Judge Li, Clerk Guo, Coroner Tao, and others arrived at the venue first. The defendants Hu Yinglong and Hu Nie, and lawyer Gu Shouyi, and the informant Zhang Zeyu all went to report. Li Judge took the seat and announced the review. He immediately ordered Zhang Zeyu, Hu Yinglong, and Hu Nie to make a bond to prove that the coffin was indeed Hu Zhang's. Guo Li first ordered the soil to open the coffin and take out the dead body on the mat and wash it. By 4 pm, it had not yet been steamed for verification, so whether there were injuries was not visible and had to wait until the steam verification was continued tomorrow before a decision could be made. The bones at the verification site were temporarily sealed and ordered police to guard the law. The judge and coroner returned to the hospital, and the two defendants were still returned to custody.</p>

<p>A Large Batch of Reactionary Criminals Escorted to Suzhou: Rugaoxian yesterday (14th) again ordered police to escort the anti-revolutionary criminal Wang Wenfu, Shen Jiuhou, Zhang Zhushan, Deng Wuzong, Bao Hua, Shen Mingjun, Zhang Changlin, Chen Yuerui, Ma Longer, Sun Yulin, Zhu Guilin, Sha Zhonggui, Shi Youwen, Huang Yincai, Tao Wanfu, Ma Dagen, Zhang Erzhang, Wu Rongqing, Wu Youquan, Zhu Changqing, Hu Zhibao, Zhou Yongmin, Huang Zhengbang, and other twenty-three people to Suzhou for delivery to the High Court. After investigation by the procuratorate, they were sent to the Third Branch Prison. The Provincial Pawnshop Industry Convenes a Meeting in Suzhou: Previously, the Pawnshop Associations of various counties in Jiangsu Province had difficulty implementing the new regulations on overdue redemption interest. They had repeatedly convened meetings and sent representatives to the province to petition. The provincial government and the Construction Department had approved the temporary suspension of the new regulations and allowed the provincial pawnshop industry to continue to convene meetings to discuss a proper solution before determining the date of implementation. It was decided to convene a meeting in Suzhou on March 15. Representatives of the Pawnshop Associations of Nanjing, Wuxi, Wujin, Yixing, Liyang, Changshu, Jiangyin, Danyang, and other counties, as well as representatives of the Shanghai Office of the Provincial Association, arrived in Suzhou yesterday afternoon. A preparatory meeting was held on the same day, and Zhou Guren was elected chairman to discuss the reorganization of the Provincial Association. Of the county trade associations, ten have been reorganized and established, and seven are in the process of being reorganized. According to the regulations, a provincial association can be organized with more than one-fifth of the members. Therefore, the association urgently needs to prepare for reorganization and first set up an office in Zhenjiang. In addition to urging the seven counties that are in the process of being reorganized to speed up their establishment, the ten counties that have been established should send the list of committee members and the charter to Zhenjiang for the preparation of the Provincial Association office. The speaker then reported that the two cases of self-posting by the current household and the shortening of the time limit are most closely related to the interests of the pawn industry itself, and the department will wait for the resolution at the general meeting. Also, the Wuxian Pawnshop Trade Association proposed to suggest that the time limit for the redemption of gold be shortened to alleviate the impact of the high price of gold.</p>

<p>The Report of a Smoke Search Causing a Disturbance and a False Report of Robbery: Zhang Ada, a villager from Banqiao Town, the 8th District (Huai Xia City), came to the city the day before yesterday to report to the County Public Security Bureau that Xu Shengwu (the son of the deceased Xu Meibo), a wealthy man in Banqiao, was secretly smoking opium at home. Upon receiving the report, Director Xu immediately dispatched Detective Team Leader Zai Shouquan to lead seven or eight detectives to search the countryside. The reporter Zhang Ada again notified Xu Shengwu that today the public security agency in the city would send people to check for smoke. Xu, upon hearing this, summoned twenty or thirty thugs to ambush inside the house on both sides of the hall. After Detective Dai and others arrived at Xu's house, they went inside to search. Unexpectedly, Xu's relief room Lu Zhongxin dared to instigate the thugs to surround Detective Dai and others, refuse the search, and even use force. Xu Shengwu went to the 1st Squad of the 2nd Platoon of the Tantangqiao Police to falsely report a robbery. Detective Dai and others, outnumbered, only brought the reporter Zhang Ada to the bureau to report. Director Xu, upon receiving the report, was furious and dispatched more police to the countryside to arrest Xu Shengwu and the relief room Lu Zhongxin to be dealt with according to law. The Eligibility Standards for People's Congress Elections are Emailed: The Wuxi County Government received an order to prepare for the election of the People's Congress and has divided the various legal groups to rush to create various rosters overnight, along with the party department's permit certificate and the certification documents approved by the county government for filing.

<p>Reasons for Wanted Notice for Shou Nengmo: The county government of this county holds regular meetings every Tuesday and Friday. December 12th last year was a Friday, and most of the committee members were away, so the meeting was postponed to the next day (the 13th). In the morning, the receiving and dispatch office sent an order from the Provincial Training Department regarding the National Salvation Fund to Shou. Shou then convened a meeting to discuss remitting the funds to the province. However, all the committee members considered the matter significant and required detailed discussion. The clerk then discovered many suspicious points in the order. Another committee member, Wang Taikui, telegraphed the Provincial Rectification Committee, which replied that there was no such matter. Shou left early in the morning of the 14th without even washing. Afterwards, the provincial party headquarters sent personnel to investigate and concluded that Shou was suspected of forging official documents. Repeated announcements were made in various newspapers in Shanghai and Hangzhou, summoning Shou to the party headquarters for questioning, but he failed to appear. Therefore, the provincial party headquarters sent a letter to the provincial government requesting the issuance of a warrant for his arrest in all counties.</p>

<p>Foreign First Division Game</p>
<h3 id="e106">Lehua's First Victory <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Defeated Portugal 4-3, Breaking the Losing Streak This Season: Since the Lehua Football Team separated from Jinan and returned to Huizhou, their strength has greatly declined and their reputation has plummeted. In various competitions of the Foreign Football Association this season, they have been defeated in every match without exception. Previously, they relied on the visit of the famous general Cao Guicheng to Shanghai to secure a draw, earning a single point and avoiding being shut out. Yesterday, they met Portugal at Shenyuan in the First Division Tournament. Fortunately, the Portuguese team was also in decline, and Lehua surprisingly won 4-3, winning two points and breaking the losing streak this season. When the good news came, it was unexpected. I record it here to inform the fans who were disappointed and did not attend. Referee: Li Silian.</p>
<h3 id="e107">(1) Lehua Achieved Unexpected Luck <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Lehua's lineup yesterday was not better than before. Basic generals such as Zhou Xianyan and Chen Yutian were absent. Only the veterans Li Ning and Guan Xun'an supported the inside, and Zhou Shaowen fought on the outside. After ninety minutes of struggle, Zhou Shaowen contributed significantly and scored three goals alone. In the last ten minutes, the two teams were tied 3-3. At that time, Portugal attacked fiercely. Lehua was able to protect the goal thanks to the efforts of goalkeeper Huang Zonghua, and the inside defense and midfield also provided considerable assistance. A call to arms rallied the entire army to fight fiercely and advance with the ball into the goal. It is difficult to record the names on the merit list of who exactly scored the winning goal.</p>
<h3 id="e108">(2) Portugal Encountered Unexpected Circumstances <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>It is unbelievable that Portugal lost to Lehua, but it happened. It can be said to be an unexpected turn of events. Although, in terms of the strength of the players on the field, Portugal's strength is not much greater than Lehua's. Gu Stain, the famous central defender in Shanghai, had no one to replace him in goal. Inner defender Marcel and wingers Gertis and Lawson are the dangerous players for the Portuguese team. Of the three goals, one came from Fafan Que's feet, and the others came from the help of other players. After conceding two goals, they took the lead with three consecutive goals and seemed to be on track to secure victory. However, they conceded two more goals, ultimately leading to defeat. Losing the game is a common occurrence.</p>
<h3 id="e109">(3) Each Side Scored Two Goals in the First Half <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Lehua kicked off, and the attack was not smooth. The enemy defended Li Jianbi, and the enemy repeatedly advanced and retreated. The Lehua forwards also advanced many times, but failed to score. After twenty minutes of stalemate, Lin Bingwen took the lead, went straight in from the border, and passed the ball in the middle. Zhou Shaowen greeted it with a kick and scored into the goal. More than two hundred spectators burst into laughter. In the laughter, the five Lehua players charged again. Zhou Shaowen did not disappoint and scored another goal. When the Portuguese team also launched a counterattack, Fafan Que took back a goal within six minutes. Two minutes later, Fafan Que dribbled the ball and explored the goal, but the inside was empty and only the goalkeeper was there. The ball was fast and urgent, and it was blocked but not far away. Fafan Que caught up and scored, making it a 2-2 tie. After that, there were storms once each, but no danger was created. Each side scored two goals in the first half.</p>
<h3 id="e110">(4) The Last Goal Determined the Victory <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The teams changed sides and lined up again. The whistle blew and the battle resumed. The players were all agile, and everyone used their strength. Thirty minutes passed like a flash. Neither team made any progress. When the Portuguese player Fafan Que attacked the goal, he suddenly collided with the goalkeeper. The ball rolled into the goal on its own. The Portuguese team suddenly took a 3-2 lead. The Lehua forwards passed the ball to each other and advanced. Zhou Shaowen's kick became a 3-3 tie again. In the last ten minutes, the Lehua forwards fought each other in front of the enemy's goal. No one knew how they squeezed the ball in. With this goal, the victory was decided. Although the Portuguese team used all their strength, they could not get past goalkeeper Huang's last gate. As a result, Lehua won 4-3.</p>

<p>Jiangnan vs. Jinan, Performance Was Average, Must Work Hard: The Jiangnan track and field team competed against the Jinan University track and field team at Zhenru yesterday. The athletes from both sides were not all present, so only three or four people participated in each competition. The interest was not strong, and the results were not excellent. This is because the athletes have been out of practice for a long time. Although it has been spring for a long time, the cold weather has forced even those who have been practicing to only stretch their muscles and bones, which cannot be called proper training. From now on, they should be able to gradually improve. As a result of yesterday's competition, the Jiangnan team won with 85 points, and Jinan scored 42 points.

<p>32 to 10 ratio Women's United States 48 to 33 victory over the Federation Men's United States 62 to 19 victory over Korea The Shanghai International Basketball Championship held three games last night starting at 6:00 PM, all held at the China Basketball Hall.

<p>(Women)</p>
<p>The Chinese women's skills are indeed superior to those of England. Regardless of stealing, throwing, passing, and tactics, the entire team can always use clever means to defeat the enemy. Shao Jinying's skillfulness, Xi Jun's throws, Yang Ren's liveliness, and Gan Yunsheng's courage are truly unstoppable. The inner defense generals are also experienced and extremely rigorous. The tie with the Federation was due to bad luck. Yesterday, they showed their true colors against England. Xi Jun opened the scoring with a free throw, and Shao Jinying scored a direct hit, immediately taking a 3-0 lead. Berling scored a goal, and then Xi and Shao scored successively, taking a 3-0 lead. The British attacked with full force, but their throws were poor, with nine out of ten misses. In the first quarter, China scored ten points and England scored three points. In the second quarter, Yang Ren broke through the line and scored a goal. Shao Jinying scored twice with the help of her teammates. The enemy's momentum turned and they counterattacked strongly, but their throws were poor, with nine out of ten misses. China won the first half 18-13. In the third quarter, the Chinese team repeatedly changed players and their energy was abundant, scoring a total of eight points, while England did not score any points. The situation slowed down slightly in the last quarter, and each side scored. As a result, China defeated England 32-10.</p>

<p>(Women)</p>
<p>Although the Federation lost to the United States yesterday, their performance was commendable. At the beginning of the game, Johnson of the Federation showed her skills and competed against Owen of the United States, attracting the attention of the audience. Each side scored eleven points in the first quarter. In the second quarter, the two teams competed fiercely, and the United States struggled to take a one-point lead. The United States led 17-16 at halftime. In the second half, the Federation's momentum suddenly declined, and their performance decreased. The United States took advantage of the enemy's weakness and launched a strong offensive, winning every battle. The Federation suffered a major loss, which was fatal to their defeat that night. Although they wanted to work hard later, they felt that the overall situation was over, but they could only do their best. In the third quarter, the United States scored thirteen points and the Federation scored three points. In the fourth quarter, the sleeping lion of the Federation initially woke up and was full of energy, but the American women's players defended well, so they could not score. As a result, the United States defeated the Federation 48-33.</p>

<p>The United States' victory over Korea was as expected as China's victory over the Jews. However, Korea's bravery and fierce struggle yesterday cannot be buried by their defeat. Within the forty minutes, Korea was always striving for survival in a state of oppression. Sincerity can overcome obstacles, but it is difficult to have an opportunity to surpass, but they gave the United States a fierce confrontation. The American players are outstanding, and the entire team is well-organized and experienced. Their strength lies in their tall stature and pure skills. When they meet China in the future, there will be a fierce battle before the winner is determined. The score difference in yesterday's victory over Korea was quite large, but the situation was very tense. The United States led 38-7 at halftime. As a result, the United States won 62-19.</p>

<h3 id="e123">French Aviators Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The long-distance flight from Paris to Tokyo may arrive at Hongqiao Airport today. French aviators Marnes and Belding are making a long-distance flight from Paris to Tokyo. They were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday. According to news from the French Consulate General, if the weather is good, the French aviators are expected to arrive today. Yesterday, the aviators stayed in Hong Kong temporarily due to poor weather in the south. The French aviators are flying a Farman aircraft with 230 horsepower. They departed from Paris on the 2nd of this month and hope to set a record for fast flight via Vietnam to Tokyo. Unexpectedly, the day after taking off from Paris, they encountered a storm and were forced to land in Aire-sur-l'Adour. The fuselage was damaged and delayed until the 9th before they could continue their flight to the Far East. They arrived in Hanoi four days later, and the flight time from Paris to Hanoi was 77 hours. Yesterday morning, they flew from Hanoi to Shanghai, stopping in Macau on the way before flying to Hong Kong. If the weather improves, the two aviators are expected to fly to Hongqiao Airport this afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Resolution of the Silk Industry Bonds <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>As a result of Chu Fucheng and others going to Beijing for the second time, the Silk Industry Group elected representatives, including Chu Fucheng, to petition for the issuance of bonds to rescue the silk industry. Representative Chu returned to Shanghai yesterday, and a reporter from the Daily News immediately visited him to inquire about the results of the trip. Representative Chu said that the case had been completely negotiated with the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, and the Legislative Yuan. According to the original request of the silk industry, a total of 8 million yuan in bonds will be issued, of which 2 million yuan will be for improving sericulture, 2 million yuan will be for improving machinery, and 4 million yuan will be for rescuing the silk industry. However, before the Ministry of Industry begins to improve machinery, silk merchants can temporarily use this money to rescue the silk industry. As for the bond regulations, the Ministry of Finance has drafted them and submitted them to the Ministry of Industry for referral to the Legislative Yuan for approval and promulgation before they can be issued.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Tragedy on the Jiangshun Steamer <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>More than 90 gambling bandits killed and injured four cooks after the ship arrived at Huangshi Port. The ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangshun Steamer had a tragedy on its return trip from Hankou to Shanghai, with gamblers stabbing a cook to death at Huangshi Port. The ship arrived in Shanghai at about 5:00 PM yesterday and reported the details of the incident as follows:</p>
<p>The Reason for the Tragedy: It is found that there are gamblers, similar to discharged soldiers, who mingle on ships along the Yangtze River to swindle money. These gamblers are divided into two factions: the Hankou faction and the Huangshi Port faction. When the ship left Hankou on the 12th, there were eighty or ninety Hankou gamblers on board. They had long-standing animosity towards the Huangshi Port faction and intended to fight them with weapons. Therefore, they carried daggers, awls, and other weapons onto the ship and scattered themselves in the cabins. At 11:00 AM on the 13th, the ship arrived at Huangshi Port. These gamblers had already prepared on the ship, waiting for the gamblers from that location to board the ship before taking action. However, the Huangshi Port gamblers did not board the ship that day, so they could not fight even if they wanted to.</p>
<p>Assault and Injury of Four People: At that time, dinner was being prepared on the ship. Because these gamblers never buy tickets, they were not given dinner. Unexpectedly, the gamblers crowded to the entrance of the kitchen and asked the cook, Yan Er from Nanjing, for food. Yan Er and Wu Shengbao, Wu Laowu, and Luo Jinshan told them that the food was not yet cooked, but the gamblers insisted on taking it, and a verbal argument ensued. Unexpectedly, more than ten of the gamblers pulled out awls and daggers and stabbed Yan Er in the chest. Then, they twisted the knife with great force, and blood gushed out. Yan Er immediately fell to the ground and died. Wu Shengbao was also stabbed in the thigh and scrotum by a gambler and also fell to the ground. Wu Laowu and Luo Jinshan were stabbed in the hands. The ship's waiter saw this and quickly blew the whistle, and the bandits scattered and fled to the large cabins.</p>
<p>The Leader of the Bandits Tied Up a Criminal: The leader of the bandits, named Li Laowu, knew that he had caused a major disaster after the crime occurred. He dragged a bandit, a man in his forties wearing a blue cloth gown, to the entrance of the cabin and tied him up, saying that he was the perpetrator. However, the crew did not dare to punish the bandit, fearing that it would provoke a major incident.</p>
<p>Military Police in Jiujiang Arrested Bandits: At 4:00 PM, the ship arrived in Jiujiang. The ship immediately raised a distress flag and a doctor's flag and first sent Yu Qixiang, the ship's liaison officer, to shore in a sampan to report to the Garrison Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau. Soon, more than thirty police officers from the land and water Public Security Bureau arrived. They first prohibited passengers from disembarking in sampans, then ordered the Jiangshun to dock against the pontoon boat to inspect passengers landing ashore, and ordered the cooks to identify the perpetrators. Li Laowu, Tan Laowu, and seventeen others, including the tied-up criminal, were arrested on the spot and escorted to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. The other bandits had already taken off their uniforms and changed into plain clothes, so many escaped. Yan Da, the elder brother of the deceased cook, was also on the ship. The Jiujiang Public Security Bureau ordered him to temporarily collect and bury the body, and the seriously injured Wu Shengbao and others were sent to the Jiujiang Hospital. Xu Guisheng from the ship's relief room was left to guard the bay and await interrogation. At that time, the doctor of the British warship stationed in Xunyang also came to inspect and confirmed that Wu Shengbao's injuries were extremely serious. Yesterday afternoon, a telegram was received that Wu Shengbao had also died from his serious injuries.</p>
<p>The Crew Reported Back to Shanghai: After the ship arrested seventeen gamblers in Jiujiang, the other bandits, because they could not be identified, also disembarked in Haixun. On the same day, the Jiangshun first telegraphed Shanghai to report the incident and stated that there had been military police stationed on the ship, but they had recently been withdrawn by the Capital Garrison Command, which led to this unfortunate disaster. After the ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday, the shipowner had already asked Chief Li to telegraph Beijing to request the Garrison Command to reinstate the escorting military police to prevent similar tragedies from happening again.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Minutes of the Diplomatic Discussion Meeting <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The 35th regular meeting of the Diplomatic Discussion Society was held at the Hong Kong Road Banking Association at 6:30 PM last night. Those present included Li Zhao, Liu Zhanen, Ye Huijun, Xia Weisong, Chen Shaoyou, Li Yingshi, Wu Zonglian, Gong Fengqiang, Xiao Jirong, Chu Huiseng, Xiang Weiqing, Li Qinghou, Shen Zhongjun, Zhang Xinglian, Huang Ruizheng, Shi Liangcai, Zhao Jinqing, Zhao Tiezhang, and more than twenty others. Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting also attended in person. The members fully elaborated on various cases and only dispersed at 10:30 PM. The agenda for the day was as follows: (A) Reporting Items (1) Committee Member Gong Fengqiang reported on the continued negotiation with Powell by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the establishment of an overseas news agency. (B) Discussion Items (1) Committee Member Ye Huijun proposed a suggestion to abolish consular jurisdiction. (2) Committee Member Chu Huiseng proposed to request the authorities to seriously negotiate with Japan regarding Japanese fishing boats arbitrarily entering our country's territorial waters to fish. (C) Temporary Motion: Second report on the establishment of an international news agency and newspaper, reporter Gong Fengqiang. Establishing an international news agency and newspaper in China now can be regarded as the most important thing for foreign affairs. However, with the national foundation just established and economic capabilities very weak, it is deeply difficult to establish such a great undertaking. However, it cannot be abandoned just because of fear of choking, and it cannot be shelved without doing anything. After spending half a year running around and consulting with various parties, the following methods have been obtained. Please decide whether they are appropriate: (1) The organization of this agency will be entirely commercial, with the government only providing one-time assistance at the time of establishment and no further subsidies thereafter. (2) The business of this agency is divided into three types: 1. Telegraph communication; 2. Daily newspaper; 3. Monthly magazine. (3) The headquarters of this agency will be located in Shanghai, with branches established in London, Paris, New York, Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Rome, and Geneva. Afterwards, it will be expanded to other locations. (4) The capital of this agency is set at one million yuan. Once 200,000 yuan of shares have been raised, the government will be requested to subsidize 200,000 yuan for the establishment. (5) The budget of this agency is the most difficult to determine. The following is a general report based on inquiries from various parties. Please study it further: 1. Daily Newspaper: The Shanghai headquarters will have a daily circulation of 50,000 copies, temporarily not counting profits. The English branch will have a circulation of 50,000 copies, the American branch 50,000 copies, the French branch 50,000 copies, the Soviet branch 50,000 copies, the Japanese branch 40,000 copies, the German branch 30,000 copies, the Italian branch 20,000 copies, and the Geneva branch 10,000 copies. The total circulation of the above eight locations is 300,000 copies. The annual newspaper fee for major newspapers in the United States, such as the New York Times, is US$32, while the Chicago Tribune is US$19.50 per year. The fees for other newspapers are generally similar. The fee for this agency should be cheaper when it is established, with an average of US$15. Advertising fees will also be extra cheap to attract customers. Each copy will have a net profit of US$1. The total profit of the eight locations will be US$300,000 per year. 2. Monthly Magazine: 20,000 copies per month domestically and 50,000 copies per month in the eight locations of England, America, France, Germany, Russia, Japan, Italy, and Geneva. The total annual circulation domestically and internationally is</p>

<h3 id="e128">Miracle Cure for Frozen Chilblains, Healed, Not Bursting <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Healed frozen chilblains in days, reduced swelling of unburst frozen chilblains on the same day. Chilblains are a condition of congealed stagnant blood. The initial symptoms are red legs and unbearable pain. After bursting, there is a constant flow of pus and even more pain. This condition is especially common at the end of winter and the beginning of spring, and there is a lack of good remedies in the world, so patients suffer from it. Now, fortunately, the Benbu Zhengwei Pharmacy (West Side Street of Wing On Company, Nanjing Road) has invented and manufactured two kinds of medicine: (1) "Pearl White Jade Cream" is used to treat broken chilblains to remove decay and promote new growth with miraculous results. (2) "Wishful Water for Chilblains" is used to treat unbroken chilblains to stop pain and itching immediately and eliminate redness and swelling. The price is extremely low. "Cream" is sold for only 40 cents, and "Water" is sold for 20 cents. Zhengwei Pharmacy branches (north of the North Sichuan Road Post Office) also sell them. 681 Special</p>

<p>840,000 copies, with each copy earning a net profit of US$0.04, earning a net profit of US$33,600 per year. 3. Telegraph: The monthly fee domestically is 5 yuan, and the monthly fee internationally is US$5. The monthly sales domestically are 2,000 copies, with annual sales of 24,000 copies. The monthly sales internationally in eight locations are 10,000 copies, with annual sales of 120,000 copies. The total annual income is 120,000 yuan in domestic currency and US$600,000. The annual telegraph fee for nine locations is currently subsidized with an income of 120,000 yuan in Chinese currency and US$600,000, with the shortfall being covered by other surplus items, limited to no more than one-third. The above budget is the approximate budget for the first year of establishment. It will naturally be very developed in the second year. However, the purpose of running a newspaper is culture, not money. If the surplus can be used to pay out a considerable dividend, the rest will be used for expansion capital. In two or three years, there will be no need to raise additional capital, and the strength of this agency will be immeasurable. In short, the government has promoted it in the initial stage, and the bright and stable future of the business is naturally beyond doubt. Discussion of the suggestion on how to abolish consular jurisdiction, proposed by Ye Huijun. Reason for the proposal: The abolition of consular jurisdiction by various countries in China is originally a diplomatic policy of the National Government and a work goal of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In recent years, through the efforts of the authorities, many of these legal rights have been recovered. According to Foreign Minister Wang's report to reporters, there are a total of 25 countries that have treaty relations with China, of which 10 countries have no consular jurisdiction, 6 countries will also give up under certain circumstances, and the treaties of 3 countries have expired. Only 6 countries have treaties that have not expired, so the date of achieving the goal should not be far away. Recently, it has been reported that the authorities are conducting negotiations with the British and French envoys on this matter. Since this association is tasked with studying diplomatic strategies to contribute to the authorities, it seems that discussions and suggestions should be made as soon as possible for adoption. Please decide whether it is appropriate. Propose that the authorities seriously negotiate with Japan regarding Japanese fishing boats arbitrarily entering our country's territorial waters to fish, proposed by Committee Member Chu Huiseng. Reason for the proposal: It has been reported that Japanese fishing boats often enter our country's territorial waters to fish arbitrarily, and even hang our country's national flag and deliberately sink our country's fishing boats. It seems that such behavior not only infringes on our national sovereignty but also deprives our people of their livelihoods and must be stopped urgently. Since this association is tasked with paying attention to the suffering of the people, it seems that a request should be made to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for serious negotiations and demand compensation for sunk ships and other losses. Please decide whether it is appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Areas with Increased International Parcel Prices <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts will issue an order to all bureaus to handle it. The Directorate General of Posts of the Ministry of Communications has increased the price of gold, and the income from international postal fees calculated in gold pounds has had a significant impact. Recently, the Bureau has revised the list of international parcel fees for some countries, slightly increasing them to make up for the loss. The Bureau will issue an order to the 23 postal regions and 36 first-class post offices in the country to follow the revised international parcel list. The areas with revised price increases are: (1) Egypt, parcels shipped directly from Hong Kong; (2) Egyptian Sudan, shipped from Hong Kong; (3) Federated Malay States and South Seas Islands, shipped from Hong Kong. All shipments transported by British ships of the Blue Funnel Line will have their postage increased by one-third during the most recent period. After the order arrives at the postal regions, the price increase will be implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Three Reports on the Burning of the "Daji" Steamer <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Exact Number of Dead Returning to Shanghai on the "Dade" Steamer: The "Daji" Steamer of the Dada Company, on the Shanghai-Yangzhou Route, Carelessly Encountered Disaster at Longjusha, Zhanghuang Port, Resulting in the Tragic Death of Over a Hundred People. Detailed accounts have been reported previously, but after the incident, the company dispatched the "Chuyuan" and "Chuting" steamers, which had not returned as of last night. The company's regular "Dade" steamer arrived in Shanghai at 7 p.m. Here is a further report on yesterday's situation:</p>
<p>The Heartbreak of Onlookers: Yesterday, family members of the "Daji" crew, having waited in vain for their return, knew their hopes were dashed. However, cut off from news, they could not be at peace. Therefore, they brought their families to the wharf to inquire and await the arrival of the "Dade" steamer. The "Dade" arrived at the port at 7 p.m., after they had been waiting expectantly for five or six hours. The chaotic scene and the news confirming the deaths of their loved ones drove some family members to near madness, wishing to die with them. Such tragic scenes defy description.</p>
<p>Registration of Names by Hometown Associations: The Tongru, Chonghai, and Qi Hometown Associations of the Nanshi district continued registering victims yesterday after beginning the day before. Many came to register. Some were single passengers who died and had no one to inquire for them, or whose fate was unknown.

<p>"Dade" Returns to Shanghai: The Dada Company's "Dade" steamer was originally expected to return to Shanghai at 1 p.m. yesterday, but was delayed because it transported clothing and coffins from the Nantong Hometown Association to Tiansheng Port. It finally arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 p.m. According to those on board, a total of 150-160 bodies were recovered from Zhanghuang Port, Xin Port, Tiansheng Port, and other locations, and are now displayed at Zhanghuang Port awaiting photographs and coffins. The rescued survivors were eager to return to their hometowns and took separate ships from Zhanghuang Port to do so. None of the crew members took the "Dade" steamer back to Shanghai yesterday. Based on this, the total number of dead is estimated to be over 160. The refugees waiting for news, seeing that the "Dade" steamer did not bring their family members to Shanghai, dispersed, making the scene at the wharf even more desolate.</p>
<p>Confirmed Number of Dead: According to further reliable sources, 119 bodies were recovered from Zhanghuang Port, 11 from Tiansheng Port, and 22 from Xin Port, totaling 152 bodies. In addition, four bodies, including one girl, were burned on the ship and transported to Zhanghuang Port for burial. It is said that the burial arrangements are as follows: those who wish to use a shared coffin can have the company handle the burial; those who wish to provide their own coffins may do so. The purchasing agent of the steamer, Xu Jingzhai, provided coffins valued at 350 yuan, and a tea servant's family provided coffins valued at 150 yuan. It is reported that coffin shops have been bought out, with the Shaoning Hometown Association acting as an intermediary.</p>
<p>Company Meeting: The Dada Company is scheduled to hold a post-disaster meeting this afternoon to discuss the aftermath of the "Daji" accident.</p>
<p>Company Statement: Around 5 p.m. yesterday, reporters from various newspapers met with Mr. Jiang Decun of the company's board of directors. Mr. Jiang stated that the approximate details of the fire on the company's "Daji" steamer near Xinjiang on the 11th of this month have been reported in the newspapers. For more detailed information, the company must wait for the "Dade" steamer to return from Yangzhou. According to the regular schedule, the "Dade" steamer should have arrived in Shanghai at 2 p.m. today (yesterday), but it has not yet arrived, presumably because the ship is taking care of everything at the site of the accident, causing the delay (note: arrived at 7 p.m., see above). When the "Daji" steamer left Shanghai, it was carrying dozens of packages of sulfur, with wooden barriers to prevent passengers from entering to avoid danger. According to those who escaped from the ship and returned to Shanghai, more than 40 soldiers boarded the ship at Tiansheng Port and searched everywhere for suitable accommodation. Finding none, they discovered the sulfur storage area in the steerage cabin. Seeing that the area was spacious, they demanded that the ship's officers open the wooden barriers so they could settle inside. The officer refused, explaining the danger, but the soldiers were enraged and tore down the barriers, rushing in and occupying the space. The officer, seeing the situation, tried to persuade them not to smoke cigarettes, but the soldiers ignored him and soon gathered to gamble and smoke wildly. As a result, within four hours, a huge tragedy occurred, and we (the survivors) were unfortunately caught in the disaster. From this, the cause of the accident is clear. The company's iron barge was more than fifty miles away when it heard the alarm and immediately rushed to the scene to provide assistance. The Shanghai company also dispatched the "Chuting" and "Chuyuan" steamers to the area to recover bodies. Shortly after, we received a telegram from the "Chuyuan" and "Chuting" steamers stating that on the morning after the accident, they rescued more than 40 passengers on the beach. These passengers had been frozen unconscious after falling into the water and were swept to the shore, where they were spotted and rescued by fishermen. On the 12th, a total of 130 bodies were recovered, most of whom were crew members of the "Daji" steamer. The company immediately dispatched Mr. Zhu Xiaozhu, the purchasing agent of the "Dahe" steamer, along with the family members of the victims registered with the Tongchonghai Hometown Association, to rush to the area on the evening of the 13th aboard the "Dahe" steamer to purchase 140 coffins and photograph the deceased before burial, awaiting identification. The families of the victims have been requesting compensation from the company. However, the company has suffered an unexpected disaster and losses of hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is extremely unfortunate. Furthermore, according to the regulations of the Shipping Industry Association, accidents such as fires that occur on company ships operating at sea are not the fault of the ships. Therefore, requests for compensation from the families of the victims should be rejected. However, the company sees that the families of the victims are mostly poor and deserving of pity. Therefore, we have no dared to openly violate the resolutions of the Shipping Industry Association and have no choice but to entrust several directors of the board to the Jisheng Society to handle the compensation on our behalf. The Jisheng Society has agreed and will send staff to investigate the situation before formulating compensation regulations.</p>

<p>Major Fire This Morning: At about 1:15 a.m. this morning (the 15th), a fire was reported at the Jinliyuan Warehouse No. 8 of the China Merchants Bureau on the Bund outside the French Concession's Xin Kaihe. Upon hearing the news, the reporter rushed to the scene and found smoke billowing into the sky. More than a dozen fire trucks and dozens of firefighters were working hard to extinguish the fire. However, the warehouse was full of goods and the doors and windows were tightly closed, making it difficult to extinguish the fire. Firefighters on the west side used axes to forcefully cut open four or five of the lower-level iron windows, causing thick smoke to pour out and rise into the sky. They diligently inserted nozzles to pour water, showing great courage. The reporter inquired about the cause of the fire, but opinions differed, making it difficult to determine the truth. However, the theory that a worker had carelessly left a cigarette fire was considered the most likely. It was confirmed that the fire was discovered at about 1:15 a.m. this morning. Initially, a dock patrolman noticed thick smoke coming from Warehouse No. 1 and knew something was wrong. He immediately reported it to the fire brigade, which dispatched fire trucks to extinguish the fire. However, it was predicted that the fire had been brewing inside the warehouse for a long time. According to people at the fire brigade, the warehouse was full of tobacco leaves, grains, and porcelain. There were a total of twenty-one warehouses, all of which were old-style buildings that had not been paved with terrazzo. However, each warehouse had a very strong wall separating it, preventing the fire from spreading. Firefighters said that the fire could not be extinguished until 9 or 10 a.m. When the reporter left the scene of the fire, the smoke was as black as ink, and the fire was still raging.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Record of a Madman's Suicide Attempt <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Wounded But Saved: At about 10:30 a.m. yesterday, a madman about 40 years old, wearing a gray lined jacket and trousers, yellow socks, and no shoes, suddenly appeared at the Shunhe pawnshop entrance of the Baxianqiao Small Vegetable Market on the Route Cardinal Mercier in the French Concession. He was holding a sharp blade and waving it wildly in the street. Suddenly, he slashed his own head with the knife, causing blood to flow like a waterfall. However, his trachea and esophagus were not severed, so he continued to scream. The patrolmen there seized the blade, hired a car to take him to the police station, and then transferred him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries were severe, but he could still be saved.</p>

<p>First Murdered His Mistress, Then Committed Suicide: The Reason Was That the Woman Had a New Lover. At about 9 a.m. yesterday, Mrs. Damo, a divorced Russian woman residing at No. 624 Route des Peres, was shot in the heart by her lover, Granovsky, and died in her bedroom. Afterward, Granovsky returned to his own residence on Rue Luber and shot himself in the head, committing suicide. A pair of lovers ended their karma with two ruthless bullets. It is said that Granovsky and the woman had been in love for four years. Three years ago, the woman divorced her husband in Jinan, and Granovsky abandoned his wife in Qingdao and brought the woman to Shanghai. They then opened a dormitory on Rue Luber, and later added another one on Route des Peres, which the woman helped him manage. When the incident occurred this morning, the woman was preparing breakfast alone in her room. Her daughter had gone to work somewhere in the International Settlement. Granovsky broke into the room and killed her before leaving. It is said that the woman had invited Granovsky to breakfast this morning, but seeing him break down the door and enter in anger, it seemed that he was not coming to the appointment. It is also said that the two had recently been on bad terms, and it was rumored that the woman now had another lover, so the motive for the case may have been jealousy. The Russian woman was 37 years old and left behind a 17-year-old daughter. Granovsky was originally quite wealthy, having purchased land and opened several dormitories in Qingdao, but now most of his assets have been squandered. He left behind a wife and three sons.</p>

<p>Lin Weiqing's Doorman Wang Jiakui Sentenced to Death for Colluding with Kidnappers: Lin Weiqing returned home from outside on the night of the 8th of last month in a car. When the car arrived at his residence at No. 55 Avenue Petain, his doorman, Wang Jiakui from Shandong, deliberately did not open the door immediately, causing Lin to be kidnapped by kidnappers lying in wait by the road. Fortunately, Lin was strong and defeated the kidnappers with his bare hands, returning home safely. He reported the matter to the police station, and the doorman was arrested. After investigation, he was found to have colluded with the kidnappers and was prosecuted in the Special District District Court. After repeated interrogations, the facts were established. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao opened a court session and sentenced Wang Jiakui to death. After the sentence was announced, he was taken away by the police for detention pending confirmation before being executed according to law.</p>

<p>The All-China National Products United Marketplace on Nanjing Road has signed a long-term lease of 35 years with Hardoon &amp; Sons for the former Municipal Government site on Nanjing Road (the previous lease of seven years has now been extended). It will form a real estate department to build an eight-story building to operate the market, a Chinese food hall, and a hotel. It is also actively reorganizing the partnership. Yesterday, Zhang Zilian, an unlimited partner, sent a letter to the shareholders urging them to pay the first installment of their shares to facilitate the project.</p>
<p>Assassination of Inspector An Case</p>
<h3 id="e141">Liangxi Hotel Owner Released on Bail <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The court ruled against the transfer. After Inspector An Zhendong of the Fourth District was assassinated, the Public Security Bureau arrested Wang Yaoting, who confessed that Li Maolin, the owner of the Liangxi Hotel on Hubei Road, who was from Wuxi, was the instigator. The bureau and the police station detained Li and brought him to the Special District District Court. The court ordered evidence to be presented for further investigation, as previously reported. Yesterday morning, Court President Zhou continued the interrogation. The defendant's lawyer, Fan Gang, submitted a letter from the Wuxi Fellow-Provincials Association proving that Li Maolin was a legitimate businessman. Court President Zhou then asked Qi Haitian, an official from the Public Security Bureau, whether there were any other witnesses besides Wang Yaoting in the case. Qi shook his head and said no, and requested permission to transfer the case. However, the police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, still opposed the transfer, saying that Wang Yaoting's confession was very vague. He said that Wang claimed that the two accomplices who went with him to commit the assassination were unknown, which was absurd in such a major case of murder. He also said that if Li gave Wang 100 yuan at the intersection of the Fourth Road, why did Li not pay him in a secluded hotel but in a public place, as if he deliberately wanted people to see it? Furthermore, he claimed not to know the date of An's assassination or the reason for the assassination. How could he not know the reason for killing a person, especially in such a serious case? Even when killing a chicken or dog, there is a reason. If he killed him, how could he not know the reason? He also claimed that An was sitting in a rickshaw at the time, but the investigation revealed that he was riding a bicycle when the incident occurred. All of this proves that Wang Yaoting's confession is not credible. If the transfer is approved based solely on this evidence, it would violate the purpose of protecting the lives and property of the people. If the Public Security Bureau has no sufficient evidence to present, we can only request his release, as Li has already been detained for a week. Lawyer Fan Gang then defended Li. Since the Public Security Bureau had stated that there was no other evidence, Court President Zhou ruled that the evidence was insufficient and did not approve the transfer. He ordered Li Maolin to pay 1,000 yuan bail for his release. If the Public Security Bureau has sufficient evidence to present, the case will be reviewed again.</p>

<h3 id="e142">After Being Dismissed, He Joined Bandits <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Cui Zuoqing Arrested and His Accomplice Arrested: Cui Zuoqing, a native of Jiangbei who was formerly a detective in the Public Security Bureau of Kunshan County, came to Shanghai and joined bandits after being dismissed. At 10:30 a.m. yesterday, he was found with a Mauser pistol and 103 rounds of ammunition hidden on his person. He hired a rickshaw and was passing through Boundary Road when he was inspected by Chinese and Western detectives from the Huishi Police Station. Cui was arrested and taken back to the police station. Under interrogation, he confessed that he had come to Shanghai on the 16th of last month. On the 23rd, he met a friend named Xiao Laoda on the street, who arranged to meet him at a teahouse on Seward Road at 9 a.m. this morning. After the meeting, Xiao asked him to take the military supplies to Zhou Jinshan (also known as Xu Yin Zhou) at No. 346 Xinjiang Road, Zhabei.</p>
<p>He was arrested en route. Detectives Ding Baoxiang and the local Public Security Bureau arrested Zhou and temporarily detained him at the bureau. Yesterday morning, Cui and the military supplies were taken to the Special District District Court, where Judge Wu interrogated him and ordered him to be detained pending the arrival of Zhou Jinshan for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Complicated Kidnapping Case <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xie Shi, a woman from Jiangbei, used to live in a thatched house in Caozha, west of the Nanshi District Court. Because the Chinese police authorities ordered all thatched houses there to be moved to prevent fires, Xie Shi moved to a place near the New Public Office in Gaochang Temple on the 10th of this month. At 2 p.m. that day, she first took her six-year-old daughter, Mao Yatou, and some sundries to the new house. When she returned for the second load, Mao Yatou suddenly disappeared. She immediately searched everywhere but could not find her. A neighbor secretly told her that Huang Wenkai, a resident of the area, was a major suspect. Xie Shi then brought Huang to the Second District Police Station. After questioning by District Chief Wang, the case was turned over to the District Court because it involved the kidnapping of a child. Until yesterday, Liu Desheng (30 years old, from Haizhou), a cousin of Mao Yatou, heard that his cousin had disappeared and inquired everywhere. He was told that Gong Huang Shi (40 years old), a widow from Fuzhou who lived at No. 4, Lane 74, Jiangbian Road, Gaochang Temple, was trafficking in children. Liu broke into Huang's house and searched it thoroughly. He found a Jiangbei girl about 10 years old lying on the bed. She claimed to be Liu Meixi, 12 years old, and said that her home was on the loft above the bed shop near Taiping Bridge. She said that her mother was friends with Huang and that she had only come to stay temporarily yesterday. Last night, she saw another woman leading out a girl about 5 or 6 years old with cropped hair. Liu became even more suspicious and brought Huang and Liu Meixi to the Second District Police Station. After questioning by District Chief Wang, Huang confessed that she had bought Meixi a few days ago for 130 yuan as an adopted daughter. District Chief Wang saw that her words did not match what Meixi said and suspected that there was something wrong. He prepared a document and sent them to the court for processing. At the same time, Chen Jiabiao (34 years old, from Yancheng), a friend of Liu Desheng, heard that Liu had arrested Gong Shi and rushed to Gong's house. There was no one at home. He suddenly found a girl about 6 or 7 years old behind Gong's toilet. He questioned her, and she claimed to be Zeng Xingzi, 7 years old. Her father's name was Lao Qiang, her uncle's name was Xiao Laohu, she was very tall, her older sister's name was A Yi, and her younger sister's name was A Mei. They lived upstairs at Hezi Dian. She could not provide any other information. Chen took her out and happened to pass the entrance of the Second District Police Station, where Liu Desheng and others were preparing to take her to court. Chen handed Zeng Xingzi over to Liu and took her to the police station. Gong Shi kept evading questions. District Chief Wang prepared a document and sent her to the court for strict handling.</p>

<p>Children's Health Society: The YWCA Children's Health Society was suspended for several months due to financial difficulties after last winter's competition, but the community's desire for it has grown stronger. It is reported that the society has worked hard to support itself and has hired Ms. Chen Xiuyun, a kind and experienced female nurse, to take on the duties of the society, which will surely make a contribution. Since the beginning of spring, it has been actively preparing and has invited medical giants and social celebrities such as Fu Wenshou, Sun Keji, and Niu Huisheng, as well as Dr. Wu Weide and Mr. Li Yuanxin, to form a committee to design and implement the program. Female doctors Lin Ju'e, Yang Suolan, Su Shouzhen, and Liu Fulin are responsible for the examination. It is now scheduled that Tuesdays and Fridays will be the inspection days. Every Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. at the association's location at 26 Nanking Road, and every Friday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. at the association's dormitory on Rue de Ste Lucie. All children from one month to ten years old can register with the association's membership department, and all expenses are free, and they can obtain new methods of health.</p>
<p>Members' Regular Meeting: The association's membership department believes that there have been few opportunities to contact other associations in the past, which has created a sense of isolation. Therefore, the department has recently made efforts to improve this, doing everything possible for the members. For young women, there are tutoring classes. For working women, there is the Vocational Comrades Society. For mothers, there is the Children's Health Society. For homemakers, there are cooking classes, family associations, discussion groups, and travel and recreation activities, all of which are intended to promote moral, intellectual, physical, and aesthetic education. Recently, it has been decided that the members' regular meeting will be held every Tuesday from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. There are various entertainment methods to help, and all members can bring their relatives and friends to the meeting. Chinese women have traditionally lacked community life. Let's work together to improve this.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Careless Fire at Old White Ferry in Pudong <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 2:40 AM, a thatched house belonging to Chen Yujin, a native of Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, residing in the grass mudflat area of Old White Ferry in Pudong, caught fire due to negligence. The house, constructed of bamboo and rice straw, ignited quickly, and the flames spread rapidly. Chen and his family were awakened from their sleep and escaped in their underwear, narrowly avoiding danger. A patrolling police officer spotted the fire and blew his whistle. Soon after, Yang Zhongquan, the head of the First Precinct of the Third District, arrived with Deputy Inspectors Duan and Tong, along with senior officers, to maintain order. They immediately directed fire hoses to the scene to extinguish the blaze. However, their efforts were insufficient, and the fire continued to burn until 3:30 AM before it was finally extinguished. A total of sixteen thatched houses belonging to neighboring residents were destroyed. The residents in the area were mostly poor migrants who were left homeless after the fire, gathering near the scene, weeping pitifully. Afterwards, Officer Yang ordered Chen Yujin, who was suspected of starting the fire, to be taken to the station for questioning. Chen claimed that he was fast asleep when the fire started and had no idea how it began. However, the station's investigation revealed two possible causes: (1) Chen's wife was ill and was brewing medicine at the time, and a stray ember may have caused the fire; (2) A neighbor surnamed Yan was cooking a midnight meal, and it may have caused the fire. However, it was discovered that Yan had been away from home for a week, making the second theory less likely. Officer Yang ordered Chen to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation and to promptly handle the aftermath to prevent the disaster victims from becoming homeless.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Further Investigation into the Robbery on Fangbang Road <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>A youth emerged from an empty house, and after interrogation, the remaining robbers were pursued. At 7:20 PM the night before, the home of Li Gentao, a resident of Lane Lianqing, No. 23, Fangbang Road in the South City, was robbed by five people. Two patrol officers, Wang Yucai and Wang Ganqing, from the First Precinct of the Second District, apprehended one robber at the entrance of Kongjia Lane, recovering a pistol. The remaining robbers escaped without a trace. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. After the incident, Xu, the head of the Second District Precinct, immediately instructed patrolling officers in the area near the scene to be extra vigilant and to immediately inspect anyone acting suspiciously without any leniency. By around 1:30 AM the following morning, patrol officer Yu Jieqing from Post No. 31 and patrol officer Wang Ye from Post No. 30 noticed a youth rushing out of the empty house at No. 8 Honglan Gan Road in a panic, behaving suspiciously. The two officers stealthily followed him, observing his movements. They saw the youth enter a small congee shop on Zhaojia Road, pretending to eat, but his unease was evident in his demeanor. As the officers approached to inspect him, the youth pulled out a wooden-handled pistol and fired two shots at them. The officers returned fire with two shots, but both missed. The youth then fled, and the officers gave chase. The pursuit led them to Xicang Road, within the jurisdiction of the Third Precinct of the Second District, where patrol officers Chen Shouzheng and Li Xingbang from Posts No. 47 and No. 48 joined the pursuit. The robber was apprehended on the spot and taken to the Second District Precinct. Xu, the head of the precinct, arrived at the Second District Precinct after hearing the news and took the suspect and the pistol back for questioning. The suspect confessed to being Li Hongjun, 28 years old, from Hebei Province, and admitted to conspiring with others, including Zhang, Guo Yifa (Guo Xiaoshou), and Chen Tianhai, to commit robbery. He also revealed that they had gathered at the First Spring restaurant on Nanyang Bridge that afternoon, and that the gun belonged to Zhang. Zhang's address was uncertain, but Guo was currently residing at No. 31 Yuqing Lane, Observatory Road, in the French Concession, and the Huidong Inn on Xizilaihuo Street, Avenue Foch. Officer Xu ordered Inspector Zhang Yude to lead several senior officers, accompanied by French police, to the Huidong Inn, but the robbers had already fled. They then went to Observatory Road and apprehended Guo's wife, Guo Gongshi, who stated that she was 34 years old and knew nothing about her husband's actions. Officer Xu, based on the confession, sent the suspect, along with a wooden box pistol No. 48568 and two bullets, to the General Bureau for review.</p>

<p>The Shanghai YMCA is actively promoting academic pursuits. The first two academic lecture series, which began in the spring of last year, have concluded with considerable success. The audience numbered approximately ten thousand. The lecture collection has been compiled and will be published soon. The third series is now continuing. It is said that contemporary figures have been invited to serve as speakers. Recognizing that the National Assembly is the most important stage during the period of political tutelage and is deeply related to China's future, the YMCA has specifically set the general theme as "The National Assembly." The topic of the first lecture is "The Construction of a New China and Agricultural Problems," scheduled for 3:00 PM on Sunday, the 15th, in the YMCA's auditorium. The speaker is Wang Jiazhen, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government. Mr. Wang is deeply knowledgeable about foreign affairs, economics, and agricultural issues. However, due to his busy official duties, he rarely gives lectures. He graciously accepted the YMCA's invitation to come to Shanghai, a truly rare opportunity. The youth of Shanghai should not miss it. Admission tickets can be obtained from the YMCA office at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang, residing at No. 113 Xintianxiang Lane, Yuanle Road, in this city, had been suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis for fifteen years. It would flare up periodically, and the condition worsened this past spring, almost becoming fatal. An X-ray taken at Renji Hospital revealed severe damage to his left lung. Both Chinese and Western doctors were helpless. He was persuaded to take Yijin Grass from the Peisheng Company on Zhonghua Road for over a month, and it miraculously saved him. Not only has there been no relapse to date, but his health has also improved. It is said that this grass has a radical curative effect on pulmonary tuberculosis, as proven by the Central Testing Institute, Dr. Lin Wu, a famous doctor, and Dr. Ye Boyang of Baolong Hospital.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Letter Requesting Strict Prevention of Fake Donation Drives <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Hu Chongji is bold and reckless, Lü Bichou, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, wrote to Nie Lusheng: Mr. Lusheng, I am writing to inform you that I recently received a letter from Shanghai Guanghua Petroleum Co., Ltd., stating that Hu Chongji, a counselor from the 8th Division Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army, fabricated a letter in Shanghai to solicit funds for the Revolutionary Orphans Education and Care Institute. The letter requested information if they were being dispatched by their department and sent the original letter for your review and reply. The Revolutionary Orphans Education and Care Institute is directly subordinate to the National Government, and all expenses are borne by the National Government. There is no connection with the institute, and we have never heard of anyone being assigned to solicit donations abroad. Hu Chongji fabricated the letter and misspelled his name, obviously impersonating and deceiving. If he comes to your company again, please immediately notify the garrison headquarters or the Public Security Bureau by telephone to arrest him for investigation, etc., in response. If the truth is not clear, the forged points are exposed to serve as a distinction. Upon investigation, the institute's official stationery always has the name of the organization printed in the lower corner of the last line, while the forged stationery has the name of the organization printed on top, and the character for Bichou in the word "宓种" is misspelled. Various flaws prove that the writing in the forged letter matches that of Hu Muzhou, who was also in Shanghai to solicit donations for the Hunan disaster last year, impersonating the Bichou letter. It is likely that Hu Chongji is a pseudonym for Hu Muzhou. The two are similar in repeatedly fabricating fraud and scams. Bichou has sent letters and telegrams to Shanghai officials requesting a thorough investigation and arrest, but he has not yet been apprehended. In addition to requesting the garrison headquarters and the municipal government to secretly investigate and handle the case, I will also send a photo of the forged letter along with the letter for your inspection and hope that you will take the time to convey it to the local wealthy merchants and widely publicize it so that they will not be deceived again. I am deeply grateful for this. Please accept my greetings, Lü Bichou's letter.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Dispute over Collection of House Tax Based on Estimated Value <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Taxpayers Association Sent a Letter Requesting Calculation Based on Actual Rent. According to the National News Agency, Li Yaoliang, the manager of Luochun Pavilion at No. 283 Zhejiang Road, previously claimed that the monthly rent of 900 taels was not sustainable and requested the landlord, Renji Company, to reduce the rent. The rent was reduced to 700 taels. However, the Municipal Council's house tax was calculated based on an estimated value of 1,000 taels. Although Li Yaoliang explained the situation to the tax collector, Mr. Yao, and the Municipal Council sent personnel to investigate and confirm that it was indeed Luochun Pavilion, and the disaster relief official Hu Tiegen went to the Municipal Council's Tax Office and met with the Westerner Kang Molai, who agreed to calculate the tax based on the actual rent of 700 taels, two checks for the winter and spring taxes of 588 taels were sent to the Tax Office the next day. However, Mr. Kang Molai did not issue the tax receipts, but only wrote two receipts, one for the winter tax of 420 taels and one for the spring tax of 168 taels, and wrote in Western text that Luochun Pavilion was unable to pay in full, and only received 168 taels. After negotiating with him, Mr. Kang denied his previous statement and claimed that it had to be calculated based on an estimated value of 1,200 taels. If it is calculated based on 900 taels, it can still be corrected. Otherwise, you can sue, etc. Li Yaoliang immediately sent a letter to the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association for assistance. It is said that the association also believes that the municipal tax should be calculated based on the actual rent as a financial principle. It should not be calculated based on the estimated value. Even if you want to increase revenue, you should consider the burden of the taxpayers and not contribute to the increase in rent, which will affect the social economy. Mr. Kang, the tax collector, is particularly inappropriate, so he has sent a letter to the Director-General of the Municipal Council for review.</p>

The United vessel did not dare to resist and immediately dropped anchor. The four men jumped into barge No. 18 and searched the middle cabin, finding two sacks of opium smuggled to Shanghai, weighing more than 200 pounds.

<h3 id="e174">Letter from the Medical Association on the National Medical Institute <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Chinese Medical Association wrote to the presidents of the five academies regarding the National Medical Institute, saying: "Gentlemen, your achievements are well-known. We have long looked forward to the opportunity to express our accumulated thoughts on the major plans for medicine and health, but have had no chance to visit your esteemed offices. We deeply regret this. Recently, newspapers have been discussing the establishment of the National Medical Institute. Our association believes that this move by the central government not only affects the relationship between old and new medicine, but also greatly impacts academic progress and national thought. We fear that seeds of error sown today will yield erroneous fruit in the future. It is more than a question of a single word being right or wrong and affecting things a thousand miles away. We, the undersigned, believe that you are pillars of the party and the nation, and that your words carry great weight and can correct wrong paths and bring about righteousness. Therefore, we dare to briefly present our humble opinions for your review."</p>
<p>"The proponents of traditional medicine today claim that it has a history of over four thousand years. In fact, from the beginning of humanity, there have been diseases, and the observation and treatment of them are necessary. Therefore, the seeds of medicine must have existed from the earliest times. Long lifespans are common to all humanity around the world, and not only China has a particularly long history. However, before the 19th century, various sciences had not yet reached a high level of sophistication. The functions and changes in the human body were largely based on speculation and guesswork. Therefore, Western Europe had the theory of four humors and three elements, and China had the theory of five elements and six qi. East and West were essentially the same. These were all unevolved hypotheses. China did not have any outstanding or superhuman insights. In modern times, with the rise of science, Western physicians have used the products of scientific evolution as research aids, abandoning appearances and seeking essence, discarding errors and embracing truth. The observation and treatment of diseases have become increasingly accurate. The old and new have been transformed, and this is how we have reached the present day. But China is not like this. It still reveres old theories and adheres to old ways. Therefore, anyone who understands the common laws of human evolution and the path of academic development in the world can clearly see that the process of Chinese medicine in history is similar to that of ancient and medieval Europe, and its position in the world is that of something backward. There are no special or miraculous treasures to be found. This can be asserted. They... proudly call it a unique academic discipline, a study that is peerless in the universe, just as summer insects talk to the well and frogs in a well cling to the limitations of the moment, or exaggerate and spread misinformation, confusing public opinion. Scholars should reject and refute such claims, and not follow blindly and be misled."</p>
<p>"The fallacy of the essence of traditional medicine has been thoroughly exposed by our colleagues for several years. Let us briefly explain it to you again. The books "Ling Shu" and "Su Wen" were falsely attributed to Taoist alchemists of the Warring States period. People in the past have already reached a definitive conclusion. Therefore, Sima Qian said that the words of the hundred schools of thought about the Yellow Emperor were not elegant or refined. Mr. Wei Shen found it difficult to explain them, and the "Tian Yuan Ji Da Lun" and other works are especially similar to the prophecies in the "Wei Shu" of the Qin and Han Dynasties. It is clear evidence that the origins of medicine lie in shamanism. From Zhang Zhongjing down to Cao Yuanfang, Sun Simiao, and Wang Tao, the "Qianjin Fang," "Wai Tai Mi Yao," "Sheng Ji Zong Lu," and "He Hui Fang" recorded diseases and listed prescriptions, gradually moving towards practicality. However, in the late Song Dynasty, the pedantic scholars of Neo-Confucianism viewed the ancient sages and wise kings as omniscient and omnipotent, and revered them as gods. Therefore, the scholars of the Jin and Yuan dynasties specialized in interpreting the "Nei Jing," resulting in obscure and confusing debates. Chinese medicine then followed the wrong path, enduring many tribulations without recovery. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, metaphysical discussions flourished. Occasionally, there were outstanding figures such as Chen Sicheng, the author of "Wei Chuang Mi Lu," and Wang Qingren, the author of "Yi Lin Gai Cuo," who advocated realism and practicality, but few people echoed them. The masses of doctors remained immersed in the debates about yin and yang, qi transformation, and the differentiation between cold, heat, deficiency, and excess, like foolishly building walls and planting weeds. The object of medicine is the biological, flesh-and-blood body. Therefore, there is anatomy to clarify its structure, physiology to study its function, pathology to understand its changes, and pharmacology to remedy its defects. Traditional medicine's anatomy is the viscera and meridians; its physiology is nutrient essence, blood, and qi; its pathology is the five elements and six qi; its pharmacology is cold, heat, warm, and cool. All are vague, general, and seemingly correct but actually false statements, empty theories, carrying a cartload of ghosts, without any practical method of seeking truth from facts, or any firm basis for verification. Because its words lack detail and evidence, they are not credible. Therefore, debates accumulate without any definite conclusion, and there is no progress to speak of after thousands of years. This is the reason. As for its therapeutic achievements, one is attributing the work of nature to oneself. As Yu Quyuan said in "Yi Lun," the medicine that cures is the one that would have cured even without the medicine. The other is the use of facts discovered by human instinct. As Yang Quan said in "Wu Li Lun," rhubarb relieves constipation and angelica stops pain, just as beans and millet relieve hunger and soup and water quench thirst. These are common experiences, and there is no other miraculous effect."</p>
<p>"Those who preside over the National Medical Institute say that they want to modernize traditional medicine. Their intention is good. However, what is called science in modern times, whether natural science or social science, takes the real phenomena of the natural world and the current state of social life as its subject matter. The method of research strictly follows the rules of mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and the laws of logic, and uses the paradigms of statistics to make judgments and determine right and wrong, and does not dare to make absurd and unfounded claims. As for fabricating facts, concocting laws, defining a system, making far-fetched analogies, and manipulating things according to one's own ideas to form one's own school of thought, it is merely fantasy. Witches, blind musicians, astrologers, and ancient philosophers and ancient medicine all belong to this category. From this point of view, it is clear that traditional medicine cannot be classified as science. The seven-foot body and the diseases of all people are all real phenomena of the natural world, and it is also clear that medicine cannot be manipulated according to one's own ideas. Therefore, to study medicine, one must base it on the laws of nature. To modernize traditional medicine, one must have people with scientific knowledge and scientific training to sort it out, in order to be reasonable. If one appoints people who do not understand science to study it, it is like asking blind people to distinguish colors, or deaf people to judge music. Its achievements can be predicted in advance. At best, it can only collect medical theories from the past, arbitrarily select and discard them, mix them with half-understood new empty theories, imitate the "Tu Shu Ji Cheng," and intensify the situation. This is already the best possible achievement. Beyond this, it can be of no use. Yet... they proclaim to the public that they are modernizing it. They say it without shame, and it will be difficult to do. As the poem says, 'Eloquent words flow from the mouth, and clever words are like a tongue. What a thick face!' This is what it means. It is not appropriate for our party to let the people of the whole country be startled by empty words, and it is not appropriate for you, gentlemen, to participate in it." (To be continued)</p>

<p>To the editor of Shen Bao, I recently read a news item in today's (i.e., March 13th) local news column about Dr. Deng Lanpu, an expert in otolaryngology, opening a clinic. It stated that Shanghai is still lacking in this specialty, which is not true. Just from my own knowledge, there is Li Gangru, professor of otolaryngology at the National Central University Medical College, residing at 76 Connaught Road, and Lin Shixi, practicing at Liji Pharmacy on Nanjing Road. Both are American medical doctors and specialists in otolaryngology who do not treat other diseases. Both are well-known for their ability to extract foreign objects from the trachea and esophagus, but they do not advertise. Sincerely, Sun Yonggao, Qitong Correspondence Office, Weihaiwei Road, March 13th.</p>

<p>— Held by Buddha</p>
<p>▲ Everyone is a blacksmith forging their own happiness.</p>
<p>▲ Life is like a journey through the desert, with more dryness and less flavor. Hurricanes are demons, and water and grass are love gods. Hurricanes are everywhere, but fertile water and grass are few and far between.</p>
<p>▲ Focus makes change possible. Reading more books by sages and worthies will make you appear dignified. Reading more books by Buddhists and Taoists will make you appear spiritually clear. The clear-minded are intelligent, and the slovenly are vulgar. Observe their person and hear their words, and you will have more than half the answer to choosing friends.</p>
<p>▲ The mind is easily moved, and people are easily drawn to good or evil. Novels, ballads, movies, and dramas have great potential power. I deeply hope that people today will be courageous in creating good and not sowing the seeds of evil.</p>
<p>▲ The power of love is unmatched by any other power. However, this "centripetal force" can be broken down by "centrifugal force." What is centrifugal force? It is reading appropriate books.</p>
<p>▲ Suicide is the act of a coward. Although the universe is narrow, is there no place to eat? Dying in the Arctic is the same as dying in a ditch, but there is a difference between Mount Tai and a feather. People in troubled times must have role models in their minds to encourage themselves and others.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Anecdotes about President Lin Zichao <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qingduo</p>
<p>Lin Sen, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, recently went abroad with Chen Yaoyuan, director of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, to investigate party affairs and overseas Chinese affairs. Just as they arrived in Little Luzon, President Hu Zhantang resigned, and Lin was ordered to serve as president of the Legislative Yuan. I will briefly describe one or two of Lin's anecdotes, which I believe readers will be happy to know.</p>
<p>Lin Sen, courtesy name Zichao, is from Fujian. In the past, he handled party affairs overseas and supported the revolution, achieving great success and earning the trust of General Sun. Overseas Chinese have deep faith in Lin, and his great name has long been famous overseas and respected at home. His qualifications in the party and the nation are very old.</p>
<p>In 1927, Lin arrived in Shanghai from Minhou and stayed at the East Asia Hotel. One day, I visited him and saw many books in the room. Lin was holding a volume and sitting quietly, reading. When he saw me arrive, he asked me to sit down. After some polite conversation, his friend Deng began talking with me, and Lin went back to reading as before. This shows that Lin is diligent in reading, meticulous in research, and especially cherishes his valuable time.</p>
<p>Lin's private residence in Minhou is in Cangqianshan, with a beautiful and charming landscape. When Lin lives in Beijing and Shanghai, he occasionally takes the time to return to Fujian to rest and enjoy the scenery of his hometown. Jiujiang and Guling are known as summer resorts with elegant scenery, and Lin also likes to visit them. Last year, he went to Guling to escape the summer heat.</p>
<p>Lin is nearly seventy years old. Although his hair is not entirely white, his beard is quite long. He is very energetic and walks briskly. He gets up very early, works tirelessly, and is usually very simple. He often wears a cloth robe, which is like the style of the ancients. His residence in Shanghai only hires one or two servants. His frugality is such.</p>
<h3 id="e178">A Sincere Admonition <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>The love suicide of Tang and Bai last month is truly a lamentable tragedy of thirty-six lovebirds with a common fate, a pair of pitiful butterflies. Reading their few lines of suicide note, one can see their sincerity. Their relationship must have been filled with many hardships. The true meaning of love, and so on, fills their hearts. Even if they can compete with the sun and moon for glory, I have something to say. Of all living things, the human body is the most precious. The highest are sages and heroes, followed by talented scholars and beautiful women, then famous actors and prostitutes, and finally ordinary husbands and wives. How can one waste the opportunity to be born in the world as decided by Yama, and return empty-handed? I like Zhuangzi's words the most: "The Great Mass carries me with form, labors me with life, eases me with age, and rests me with death. He who loves my life also loves my death." Therefore, avoiding the labor of life and pursuing an unwholesome death is called going against fate. Therefore, religion punishes those who cannot be reborn, and the law considers it a crime. Moreover, suicide has always been called cowardice, and double suicide is even more contrary to morality. If one cannot avoid the storms on the Lan Bridge, or the thorns in the distant Penglai Island, then, as the saying goes, "The higher the Tao, the longer the demon," one should meet the soldiers with generals. It has been said that the person can return three times, and the moon can be seen twice. Youth is no better than the yellow earth where the mandarin ducks lie. Alas, Tang and Bai are gone. What I feel is that all love is like the true meaning of Tang and Bai? Among them, can the utilitarianism, money, romance, song, dance, deformity, and coercion be denied? Therefore, it is common to see poems of fans being rejected in the morning and petitions for divorce in the evening. Moreover, there is the bitterness of the lotus in the heart, the thorns of the rose piercing the hand, and the shadow of the sand cast on the jade, which is difficult to erase. The clouds and rain turn over, the moon falls, and the stars fade. Even if one throws a mouse, one is afraid of breaking the vase, and it is difficult to cut off the head of a viper. The crazy ones swallow pain to kill themselves, and the mad ones are treacherous and romantic. Such foolish men and resentful women suffer in vain, and their karmic debts are difficult to repay. However, for those lost in the labyrinth of realization, there must be a middle path to point the way. I believe that in the years of schooling, it is more important to seek knowledge than to seek a partner. The harm of unrequited love is less than that of losing one's body. Etiquette and education should be interpreted as order, and why must they be overthrown so quickly? Men and women should be friends, and there is plenty of room for inquiry. Avoid the suspicion of throwing pearls into the dark. It does not hurt for matchmakers to introduce, invoking the meaning of the old horse knowing the way. Parents should be consulted, remembering the words of caution at the beginning of marriage, and being mindful of the admonition of assessing character. It is important to comprehensively observe the environment and avoid being childish and learning civilization. Beauty comes from causes, and completion comes from delay. Thus, grievances and resentments are both eliminated through external action, and love is guaranteed its freedom. Otherwise, throwing oneself into the net of love too easily is like binding oneself, only to regret being like a silkworm making its own cocoon. Once the flames of desire ignite, it is difficult to save the moth that rushes to the lamp, only to follow in the footsteps of the moth in the moon palace, adding a page to the history of tragedy. Is this not a cause for grief? This is why I wrote this sincere admonition. May the son of the state and the daughter of the nation not laugh at these humble words. This official is a new entrant and does not shrink from taboos, daring to offend the imperial majesty. I am filled with trepidation.</p>
<p>Note by Juan: Tang is a fellow writer, and Tang Meixi is a young and talented man, gentle and refined, with a foundation in epigraphy, poetry, and fiction. Last year, he attempted suicide at the West Lake Hotel and was rescued. Now, he has finally died for love. Alas, I am saddened.</p>

<p>— Lucky Person</p>
<p>Ms. Hu Die has devoted herself to the screen and her reputation has spread, earning widespread praise. I still remember two years ago, when song and dance dramas were popular in Shanghai. The children of the film industry dared not lag behind. When the Mingxing Film Company's "Blood of a Lover" premiered at the Central Grand Theater, all the male and female stars joined in singing the "Great Grape Fairy" on stage. The role of the fairy in the play was played by Hu Die. Her delicate voice turned and twisted, and those who heard it listened attentively. Her teacher, Mr. Wang Meiyu, praised her as a rare talent and composed a song to promote her, with the line, "The Hu family's charming daughter is named Hu Die. The butterfly board plays, the butterfly powder is fresh." The teacher once listened to songs for forty years and rarely praised anyone. Ms. Hu's oriole voice is graceful and can be heard for three days, but unfortunately, only those near the water tower can taste it. If it could be recorded and shown with the film, then two beauties would be combined into one. Now, years have passed, and the sound film "Sing-song Girl Red Peony" is popular far and wide, and the starring role is played by Ms. Hu. Mr. Wang can be said to be a connoisseur.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Trivial News from the Xin Chang Incident <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Facts</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Chang ship hit a reef, resulting in a loss of more than one million yuan, which is a great misfortune. The details have already been reported in the newspapers. Here are some small news items about this incident:</p>
<p>▲ Stranded on a Warship: The Xin Chang hit a reef six or seven li from Ma'an Mountain and one li from Sijiao Mountain, between Huanglong Mountain and Dingshan, a place called Arite Reef. It is located in the middle of the four mountains. First, the bow of the ship became trapped in the reef, and then the engine room broke and all the lights went out. Decades ago, China's first cruiser, the Hai Tian (even larger than the Hai Qi), sank in the same place. Now, the Xin Chang accident occurred on top of the sunken body of the Hai Tian warship. The Xin Chang's draft was eighteen feet, and the bottom of the ship was supported by the Hai Tian's chimney and pilot platform. The reason it could last a day and a night without sinking was the lifting force of the Hai Tian. Until forty-eight hours later, the bow of the ship began to enter the sea, the cabin broke, and the whole ship sank, with only one chimney exposed on the surface of the sea.</p>
<p>▲ All Crew Members Drifting at Sea: After the accident, Tang Rihua and the other twenty-five employees of the cargo department first released four wooden planks into the sea to escape. The danger of navigating in the dark on a lonely boat amidst the stormy waves can be imagined. Unexpectedly, the wooden planks were not equipped with oars. The twenty-five people were tossed by the waves and could not control themselves, so they let them drift with the waves on the sea. At the critical moment, the Yihua Guangsheng ship arrived and the shipowner discovered them and tried hard to salvage them, and all twenty-five people were saved.</p>
<p>▲ Bald Heads and Bare Feet: The ship hit the reef at 7:05 AM, and the lights went out at 9:00 AM. There were a total of 112 workers on the ship. At that time, they only wanted to survive, and rushed to the deck to grab the lifeboats. At that time, those who lost their shoes and hats did not care. Some had already entered the cabin and were preparing to sleep, but got up in a hurry and did not even have time to put on their clothes. They escaped to Arite Island and Sijiao Mountain in four batches. They starved on the mountain for twenty-four hours, and most of them were in thin clothes, suffering from hunger and cold. Their misery was unbearable. When they arrived in Shanghai, they were extremely embarrassed. The Bureau has agreed to give each person forty yuan as a subsidy.</p>
<p>▲ The Huge Loss: The Xin Chang was the first ocean liner of China Merchants, and its steel hull was of the highest quality, worth 800,000 taels. The Hong Kong government's ship inspections are the strictest. Ships that are slightly old are not allowed to travel. Those that are allowed to carry passengers to Hong Kong must be special first-class ships. The Xin Chang was one that could carry passengers to Hong Kong, so its quality can be known. The quality of its machinery was especially the best. This time, just in terms of freight costs, the loss is about 200,000 yuan. Combined with the value of the ship's body, the crew's belongings, and passengers' luggage, the loss is about 1.3 million yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Books Also Looted: After the shipwreck, fishing boats considered it the only benefit they should enjoy. The day after the Xin Chang hit the reef, four fishing boats sailed to the ship and looted all the public and private property and money. Moreover, they looted the various foreign books specially prepared in the shipowner's office, the first-class cabin, the account books in the accounting room, and the special and valuable navigational charts used by the shipowner and the first and second mates. If the navy is not sent to protect them, I am afraid that the engine and machinery will also be dismantled.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Spring in the Art World <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>"A year's plan starts in spring." This is the clear teaching of the ancients. The members of the Yicheng Society are working hard in spring, and therefore a spring painting and calligraphy exhibition is being held. Yu Guang's writing of mountains, red trees, small boats, and stone bridges is faint in meaning and majestic in atmosphere, which belongs to fine works. Wang Ziyuan's landscape with colors is intended to be between Da Chi and Lu Tai, and is also a work that is only worth watching. Jiang Yinan's plum blossoms in ink and vermilion are unique in charm, and he sends a branch of spring to Jiangnan. He is worthy of his name. Li Qiyun is old in revolution. He was lucky enough to escape from the Huanghuagang uprising. Recently, he has been living by the seaside and often uses painting to express the depression in his heart. He hangs several works on the wall. His brushwork is wonderful and does not adhere to the rules. If you judge by the standards of the law, you are not a friend of Qiyun. Qiyun's signature is "Qingxiang Old Man." Meng Shouzhi's painting of vegetables is lifelike and can fill a plate. In winter, the cold is bitter and the vegetables are damaged by frost, and the price is strangely high. Although we poor scholars want to bite the roots of vegetables, it is very difficult. Looking at it, one cannot help but drool. Qian Hufo's Buddha has been found outside the room since Zhao Yiqian, and is becoming more and more refined and healthy. Wu Shigong's flowers and plants have the artistic style of Dong Xin. In terms of calligraphy, there are Yang Xizi, Luo Lianggong, and Xiong Jizhen, who are quite lively. After appreciating it, I had a meeting with Hufo and Mr. Yuan Xilian. Mr. Yuan has recently devoted himself to meditation and is able to personally write Brahma scriptures, release flames alone, and eliminate evil. A few days ago, Yao Minghui built the Amitabha Pagoda in Jinsu Town, An'ting, and invited Mr. Yuan to chant scriptures. Farmers came to watch, so they invited a photographer to take a picture as a souvenir. In the picture, a mountain emerged behind the pagoda. There are no hills within two hundred miles of An'ting, so it was considered a miracle. The photo was shown to Mr. Yuan, and indeed there was a faint shape of undulating hills. Everyone was surprised for a long time. Hufo collected cigarette boxes, which are very rich, and intends to hold an exhibition, showing dozens or hundreds of them, all of which are famous and precious. It is said that the Beauty brand originally had the words "Lu Meiyu," but after a dispute, the three words were removed. Also, the Zun brand originally had the card pattern of "Yao Ding Er Si," and some said that it promoted gambling, so it was changed to "Seven Stars." The Fairy brand fairy holds a five-color flag. Since the Party army cleared the territory, the five-color flag has been transformed into a shield. New images are common and the old view cannot be seen again. It is currently being sought. Unexpectedly, a small box has such vicissitudes. However, those who are not as mindful as Hufo cannot know the details.</p>

<p>Chapter Seventeen: Secret Art to Preserve Youthful Looks, Emerald Green Dyes the Eyebrows; No Method to Prolong Life, Gold Market for the Swift Steed's Bones</p>
<p>That Auntie Jin was a person without any opinions of her own. Upon hearing that the illness could be contagious, she was initially terrified and then said, "When the Third Young Master and Sixth Young Miss go to the hospital, who will serve them?" Ye San replied, "Didn't I say that there are nurses in the hospital? You don't need to go. Just check on them once a day. Go and call Big Belly Jin in here for me; I have something to say to her." Soon, Big Belly Jin came in, carrying her big belly. She recognized Ye Tonghou and said, "The Third Young Master and Sixth Young Miss, looking at their health, they seemed quite robust. Who knew they would suddenly fall ill?" Ye San then directly said that she had a severe case of diphtheria and would be sent to the hospital tomorrow morning. Big Belly Jin said, "Oh dear, hospitals are very expensive; I'm afraid it will cost several dollars a day!" Seeing Big Belly Jin's hesitation, Ye Tonghou, fearing he would have to take responsibility, said, "You don't have to worry about the hospital fees; I'll take care of the bills." Upon hearing that Ye San would cover the hospital expenses, Big Belly Jin felt relieved of responsibility and knew that the disease was contagious, and there were many young women in the troupe; if it were to spread, it wouldn't be a joke. Another thing that Big Belly Jin was very worried about was that everyone knew diphtheria was contagious, and if this news spread, customers would be too scared to come and watch the shows, which would greatly affect her business. She then immediately agreed. As for the Flower Old Sixth side, Ye San also delicately explained to her. Hua Yuanchun said, "Third Young Master, I'm afraid I'm really going to die in Beijing. Rather than die in the troupe, it's better to die in the hospital. Before leaving, I said in Shanghai that I would treat you as family when I arrived in Beijing, and now you truly are my family." Ye Tonghou said, "Old Sixth, don't say such things. Illness and suffering are just unfortunate times; there's nothing to be surprised about. We are both from the south, and we should help each other. If I were sick, perhaps you would come and take care of me." The next morning, Flower Old Sixth entered the Chengnan Hospital. As she left, she shed a few tears and said, "This time, I'm going to kick the bucket." Auntie Jin could only watch the house in the courtyard and run to the Chengnan Hospital every day to check on her. Ye Tonghou was very busy but still went to see her twice. However, this was an isolation ward, and the doctor was very reluctant for people to visit, so he could only make phone calls to inquire. However, on the seventh day after entering the hospital, Flower Old Sixth's condition was hopeless. Fortunately, Ye Tonghou had not yet left Beijing, so all the clothing and coffin costs were covered by Ye San. Although Flower Old Sixth had some jewelry, Big Belly Jin said that she would keep it safe, fearing it would be lost, since Sixth Miss was not around. It was likely that Old Sixth owed them some money. Ye San also sent a telegram to Grandma Pan in Shanghai, which he had known beforehand. He had asked Flower Old Sixth who her best girlfriend in Shanghai was, and she said it was Grandma Pan.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Standard Gold Shows Signs of Weakness <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Fluctuations occurred from time to time. Yesterday, March 14th, the trend of standard gold showed weakness. In the morning, it was sluggish, and then suddenly, three or four taels of trading volume fluctuated inexplicably. Eventually, it continued to fall by four taels, breaking the 700-tael mark. The foreign exchange rate lengthened by half a point, while the domestic market turned weak to flat. The overseas silver market rose slightly, but the situation was peaceful, so the gold price was not affected. Trading within the market was still active, with Dalian gangs, Yuansheng, Xinheng, Hengxing, Yuan Fuchang, etc., all buying in, and Zhifeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, etc., having frequent transactions. Fuyu, Hongli, Hengyu, etc., were sellers. Soon after, bills of exchange became loose, leading to a downfall of ten taels, especially with swaps approaching, requiring more parties to post bonds, resulting in scattered floating and some selling. Furthermore, with strong buying momentum and British gold banks still accommodating at 1 shilling and 4 pence to 3 pence 9375, the gold price gradually rose, and the atmosphere turned peaceful. Finally, it stood at over 697 taels. In the afternoon, due to the Saturday market closure, the week's turbulent and unpredictable nature was traced back. The highest price was 746 taels and 8 mace, and the lowest price reached 683 taels and 3 mace, with a difference of 63 taels and 5 mace. Overall, it suddenly fell by 45 taels, which is considered significant.</p>
<p>A decrease of 3 taels and 7 mace occurred from the morning's April opening at 701 taels and a half, the same as yesterday's closing. The silver price rose slightly by one-sixteenth, adding eight and three-eighths of a cent. The initial telegraph only added one-sixteenth, and people's hearts stabilized. Wanxing and others bought in, causing a brief rise of 0.04 taels, but it quickly turned downward, with Fuyu, Hengyu, Yuancheng, Yongyuan, Maoyong, etc., selling off. There were also rumors of the Japanese Hamaguchi cabinet resigning, creating a troubled atmosphere that led to a sharp drop of over 11 taels, reaching 692 taels and 5 mace. Soon after, there were slightly more buyers, increasing to 95 taels and 5 mace, but British gold became even more scarce. Banks advanced from 1.39375 to 4 pence, then 4 pence could be settled, which was then bought by Shanghai for next month at .0625.

Around 11:30, it was counted as 700 taels. Afterwards, it turned to a small face, but it was erratic and unpredictable, with fluctuations of 2 or 3 taels in a few minutes. At noon, it was 96 taels and 5 mace, due to the mutual control of both the buying and selling sides.

<p>This was the first export since the business opened. The silver dollar inventory in the Shanghai port has been abundant since the business opened. Due to the lack of a market and the declining market price, the news of the purchase and loading in Shantou spread yesterday, so the market price has risen slightly in the previous days. As of yesterday, each money shop was packing them into boxes and exporting them by iron wheel. The total amount was found to be 1.2 to 1.3 million.

<p>The Securities Bond Market is Getting Quieter, and the Price is also Stagnant, Slightly Weaker than Before.

The total daily volume was only about 8,000 yuan for Reorganization Finance and other types. Major players observed the situation, and bond prices did not change much. The stagnant situation was even worse than before. As a result, the volume retracted slightly compared to the previous day, with the number only around 0.2 yuan. Bond-specific futures and spot prices opened before closing, and compared to the previous day, the transaction volume was as follows: Six-Four Seventy Thousand (647,000) [fell] 0.2, One-Four-Four Thousand (144,000) Customs [remained unchanged]. Three-Six-One-Nine-Zero (361,900) Six-One-Nine-Five (61,950) Customs [fell] 0.1, One-Zero-One Thousand (101,000) Disarmament Current [fell] 0.3, Reorganization Small Current [fell] 0.3, Reorganization Three [fell] 0.15, Reorganization Four [fell] 0.005, Disarmament Three [fell] 0.3, Disarmament Four [fell] 0.35, Finance Current [remained unchanged], Finance Three [increased] 0.005, Nine-Six-Three-Two-Zero (963,2030) [fell] 0.1, Nine-Six-Four-Two-Zero (964,2045,2045) [fell] 0.15, Nine-One-Cuoen-Three (91) [increased] 0.005, Nineteen Customs [fell] 0.2, Nineteen Customs Four [fell] 0.1, Nineteen Good Three [increased] 0.1, Nineteen Good Four [remained unchanged], Three-Zero-Cuoen (30) Current [fell] 0.5, Three-Zero-Cuoen Four [fell] 0.35. The yarn and cotton yarn market situation is on a downward trend.</p>
<p>The yarn market trend is weak and the downward trend is intensifying. The yarn market has become increasingly depressed, the decline is intensifying, and it is difficult to predict the fluctuations. This is mainly due to the exchange rate relationship, which makes people feel confused. However, the sales of current yarn are quite sluggish, and the actions of various gangs are very few. The overseas cotton yarn situation is becoming increasingly ordinary, so retail investors tend to sell short. However, certain large merchants and large players are contacting to buy, and their minds are full of thoughts. The amount of the package is increasing, and it is said by those familiar with the content that if the price falls below 64 taels for the March standard yarn, the buyer may have a very large pickup. Therefore, the market situation for the near-month months of March and April has become increasingly hard, while the far-month is slightly looser, with a tendency to shift towards near-high and far-low.</p>
<p>The standard gold market has fallen, especially in the far month. At the opening of the Shanghai Standard gold market, due to the flatness of American cotton and the lengthening of the exchange rate, the market atmosphere became increasingly loose, and the price fell by 2 taels each. The results were that each fell by 0.06 to 1.08 taels. After the opening in the afternoon, due to the market closure of the gold in the morning entering the 700-tael mark, the selling atmosphere in the market became even stronger, and the price fell by 1 to 1.12 taels each. The total volume for the day was 30,150 packages. The investigation showed that 1,100 packages were sold by Tongyu, 950 packages were sold by Tianlong, 1,600 packages were sold by Shenji, 1,200 packages were sold by Hengchang, and 3,200 packages were sold by Xincheng. 2,450 packages were purchased by Gongtai, 850 packages were purchased by Rongxing, 2,450 packages were purchased by Hengde, 1,400 packages were purchased by Yichang, and 1,000 packages were purchased by Changfeng.

<p>The cotton market is very depressed, and the downward trend is quite intense. This is because the world cotton market is moving towards several paths, and the price of silver is rising daily, causing the exchange rate to lengthen, causing people's hearts to weaken. Dongmian Trading Company, the Japanese company with the most intense intention to enter, has recently taken a mediocre view of the overall situation and is also hesitant to move. The amount of cotton that has been absorbed is huge. The current cotton business is very quiet. Each factory is becoming increasingly determined to deal with high-priced raw materials due to the poor sales of yarn, so most of the standard cotton needs to be viewed at 38 taels.</p>
<p>The Hubei standard fell by 1 tael. At the opening of the Hubei standard market, due to the flatness of American cotton and the lengthening of the silver price, people's hearts softened and there were few buyers, and the price fell by 0.07 to 0.08 taels each. In the afternoon, due to the poor gold price, the price fell by another 0.05 taels. The total volume for the day was 78,800 dan.

<p>The Grain and Rice Market is Turning Firm. Yesterday, more than 20 boats arrived downstream of the river in Zhabei. Sales were caused by the rebound of the previous day, which caused a small number of shops to hold firm on high-priced northern japonica. Trading turned slightly brisk, and the situation for thin rice was stable. Buying sentiment was slightly better, and the market was tight by half a chi. There was not much source of sheep glutinous rice, and digestion was normal. Prices remained unchanged. Duzi glutinous rice ports and customer gangs selected and proceeded with transactions. The market situation was not very glorious. The arrival of white yuan was sparse, and sales were connected to the market price, which was stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 20 rice boats were seen arriving in the Shanghai South, but sales on the main street were not very brisk. Changxi northern japonica was still sluggish in the morning, but the market was stable at noon. Sales of early and late rice on the southern road varied. The trend was stable. The top early rice opened at 11 yuan. Various customer gangs in Yangdujian Bridge were still acceptable, and the arrival of goods was not prosperous. The market was firm, but the medium grade was still mediocre. The turnover of shady yuan was sluggish, and there was no change because the inventory was both light.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Customer Indica Price Falls and Sales Move <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The initial market conditions for customer indica rice yesterday were very dull because neither the domestic nor foreign customers had any intention to purchase. Some cargo owners were willing to depreciate prices for sale. Afterwards, Sichuan gangs took the opportunity to limit the price to buy 4,600 packages, and the market was able to stabilize. However, the market price rebounded by only 0.2 to 0.3 cents compared to the previous market. Those who opened at 12 yuan 8 cents in the previous market only sold for 12 yuan 6 cents. Those who opened at 13 yuan for special high-grade goods also only bargained for 12 yuan 7 cents. The intermediate grade was even softer. In total, 3,400 packages of Jiangxi machine late rice were sold at prices ranging from 12 yuan 6 cents to 12 yuan 3 cents and 2/10 cents. 1,200 packages of Hunan machine rice were sold at prices ranging from 12 yuan 2 cents and 3/10 cents to 12 yuan 1 cent and a half. A small amount of Nanjing machine rice was also sold by the street at 9 yuan 9 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Powder Market, Foreigners Advance Smoothly <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, the market for each month showed a winding trend. The price of foreign wheat had been as low as three or four cents, and the weather was still smooth and sunny. The general prediction was that the price would continue to fall without a doubt. The decline was no more than a flash in the pan before rebounding. This month opened as low as 2 taels and 07 cents. The six and seven months were at the 2 taels and 04 cents and 2/10 cent level. Since the buying momentum from outside the industry was very strong, the opening price of each month gradually increased. The opening prices have gradually increased until the afternoon, with the buying momentum from outside the industry still very smooth and the manufacturers' selling volume was slightly cold. Therefore, each month saw better performance. Although this situation was partly due to smooth purchases from outside the industry and partly due to the rebound from the big drop, judging from the facts, there is still a trend of continued decline because the factory has set a price of only 4 taels for four ships of foreign wheat. As a result, this month rose by 0.01 compared to the previous day, April rose by 0.01, May rose by 0.01 and 2/10 cent, June rose by 0.01, July and August were each pregnant with 0.005 cent.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Futures Wheat Market Rebounds <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the futures wheat market yesterday morning, the market for each month generally showed a flat and weak trend. The price of foreign wheat had been as low as three or four cents, and people inside and outside the industry inevitably turned weak. Although the trend was not good, the minds of those outside the industry were consistently bullish. Those who shorted would never release their positions without determining the price of foreign wheat. The stagnation of the market atmosphere was due to this. Until the afternoon, each month rebounded because the flour market turned stable, and buyers from outside the industry and some floating shorts also started to scramble to cover their positions. Therefore, both the near and far terms saw a rebound. However, since the road to foreign wheat from abroad has not been cut off, there is no time to expect too much. As a result, this month was better by 0.02 than the previous day, April was better by 0.03, May was better by 0.02, June and July were better by 0.04, and August was better by 0.02.</p>
<p>Silk, Tea, and Foreign Firms, the Silk Market Turns Upward</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai saw a gradual increase in silk prices. Because the European and American telegrams turned the silk prices slightly higher, the exchange market stabilized, and the European firms rushed to take action. However, Chinese silk merchants still found it difficult to sell silk because the silk was insufficient. Yesterday, only Mitsui and others took 40 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, and Qianli and others took 35 packages of yellow factory silk. The prices of 20 packages of rough yellow silk were taken by the United States and Japan, and the prices were firm.</p>
<h3 id="e194">The Sale of "Zhenmei" Tea from Various Regions is Smooth for European Export <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, tea firms such as Tongfu, Jinlong, and Ruichang, which deal in "Zhenmei" green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and Shexian, as well as the Russian Tea Association, were actively engaged in transactions, and the market was not quiet. Yongxing, a firm specializing in "Zhenmei" and "Xiumei" tea, also saw demand. The total transaction volume for the entire city reached over 1,100 crates. "Zhenmei" tea from the eastern part of Liyuan was sold at prices ranging from 60 to 84 taels, while "Zhenmei" tea from Tunxi Shendu was sold at prices ranging from 51 to 58 taels. Market prices were generally quite firm, while other teas remained stable.</p>
<p>The Trend of Tinplate is Difficult to be Optimistic. Over Four Thousand Crates of British Tinplate Were Ordered.</p>
<p>Recently, the tinplate market has become chaotic due to reports of price declines in production areas, which initially led to a sense of panic in the local market. The standard domestic prices are exceptionally weak. For example, Dutch "Huangmian" was sold for 131 taels, "Baimian" for 134 taels, and "Xiaohong" for 118 to 119 taels. It is rumored that many customers have a large amount of spot goods in hand and are selling them everywhere, so the market is difficult to be optimistic about in the short term.</p>
<p>Over Four Thousand Crates of 90-Pound and 100-Pound British Tinplate Were Ordered Yesterday by Foreign Firms Such as Taihe and Jiecheng for Immediate Shipment.</p>
<p>The price was 16 shillings and 2 pence for 90 pounds and 17 shillings and 3 pence for 100 pounds. It is said that the buyers are iron merchants from the North Suzhou Road area. Hardware stores on Duobailao Road (Broadway) also placed orders.</p>
<p>The Price of Wood Ear in Hankou Continues to Decline.</p>
<p>Since last month, the price of wood ear has been declining daily due to weak demand from various groups. Initially, the purchase price in Hankou was stable, so the decline here was relatively slow. However, recently, frequent reports of price declines in Hankou have made the market atmosphere increasingly sluggish. According to yesterday's telegraphic message, "Shi'er" has already dropped to 80 taels, and "Guanfu'er" is no longer above 130 taels, so the Shanghai market has also been affected. Yesterday, the "Shi'er" was sold for only 88 to 90 taels, and the transaction was still not strong. The trend is still difficult to stabilize. "Fuer" was sold for 150 taels. The inventory in Shanghai is not much, and the market situation is relatively stable.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 7,100 Crates of Tea Dust Shipped to Russia, 1,900 Crates of Glass Shipped to Hankou. Another 4,000 Bags of White Rice from Hunan Arrived. 2,300 Tons of American Steel Arrived. 1,200 Crates of Cigarettes, 800 Pieces of Leather from the UK, 500 Tons of Fresh Eggs from the South Sea Islands, and 2,000 Tons of Soybeans and Soybean Oil Shipped to Europe. 6,000 Bags of Granulated Sugar and 2,000 Bags of Raw Peanuts Shipped from Hong Kong to South China. 160 Pieces of Silk Shipped to the UK.
