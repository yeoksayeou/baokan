<p>堅持所謂基本原則</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政會今晚開會日總代表芳澤日未使會員守待及時蒞會與各會員一一和靄握手旁聽席中仍極擁擠蓋皆切欲一覩日内瓦所演空前巨劇之最後一幕也中國總代表施肇基博士最後至會議遂於午後六時二十分開始議長白里安起立宣讀日政府答凱洛格非戰公約簽字國所予中日兩國同式電文之覆電繼乃解釋中日代表團各請展緩開會時間　將行政會决議案請示於各本國政府之理由白里安於是乃請中日代表聲明目下是否已處可以討論該决議案之地位</p>
<p>施肇基博士乃於全堂肅靜之中起立向會衆致詞謂中政府原望行政會早可使日軍之撤退得以實現但閱時一月雖有美國代表列席行政會而形勢仍未稍變行政會會員參議之美國代表遲遲不能覓得一解决方法竊恐輿論將爲駭異遷延日久勢必使國聯地位受有影響雖然渠願屈從行政會之志願而接受其决議案以爲趨嚮諒解之第一步驟渠今悉行政會將於十一月十六日重行集議日本之撤兵須於是日完成</p>
<p>施博士繼又表示意見請日本之澈兵延宕久矣蓋自佔地迄今已閱五星期矣渠今晨猶接本國政府電告日飛機復在各處抛擲炸彈再者所過去之每一小時中皆足發生令人扼腕之事件中政府固願續施保護在華日僑之計畫但日軍久佔不退恐抗日情感亦將持久第日軍之撤退必可使輿論有甚有益之變調也</p>
<p>再有一節須向行政會聲明者滿洲日軍之撤退當然應包括一切軍隊與警察憲兵飛機類之副軍隊在内此外自九月十八日起日軍所佔中國之産業應悉交還施諸中國官員與銀行之禁例應即終止</p>
<p>施博士末謂渠意日軍撤退後當繼以判定九月十八日事變之責任今後中國與其他列强間之任何討論必須根據於凱洛格非戰公約國聯會章及一九二二年華府公約云施博士致詞畢議長白里安起讀日政府提出之對案文對案之首三節除第一節之首句曰「備悉此宣言適合國聯會章之精神」外餘與行政會章之首三節字句相同自第四節起之各節與國聯决議案完全不同第四節紀悉十月十三日日代表之宣言據此日政府將於中日兩政府間在支配其尋常關係之基本原則上所豫有之諒解見諸實施使情感温和</p>
<p>與緊張事態終了時可進行辦理撤軍退入鐵路區域事所謂基本原則者即許給日本人民生命安全及其財産保護之保障是前五節請中日政府立即協商以期成立此種諒解第六節請中日政府各派代表商定實行撤兵與接收退出各地之細則第七節請兩國政府以兩國間談判之發展及目下决議案執行之進步情形報告行政會第八節授權行政會議長於審查上述公文後施行渠以爲擔保目下决議案執行所必要之一切計畫並在任何時召集會議以期續事審查滿洲之局勢</p>
<p>白里安宣讀日本之對案後繼稱今晨渠曾與芳澤談話芳澤告以日政府對行政會决議案中數項之異議並表示日政府願照以草擬决議案之方式同時芳澤並授以臚列此項條件之備忘錄内含極多之修正簡直等於一對案此須即加辯論故特召集行政會本次公開會議云</p>
<p>於是芳澤起立評述行政會之草案謂日政府不能確定撤兵日期惟日軍之戌滿絶非出於欲加壓力於中國之願望僅爲目前之時局不得不出此耳芳澤繼謝行政會不辭勞瘁堅忍挽救戰爭之危險並維持國聯之原則與尊嚴謂此項責任固爲日政府所深知者日政府從未作侵害和平之夢想實因本身與其人民遭遇甚痛苦之環境故乃取自衞計畫以保和平與安寗此中並不含有侵逼或仇對之意志其容許軍隊越出鐵路區域僅求實施盡其保護責任所切要的計畫自始即力避增重時局</p>
<p>芳澤又切實聲明日本在滿並無土地的野心一俟事勢可以撤兵而無危險即擬撤回其軍隊况撤兵今已開始原派往鐵路區域外之軍隊今已有過半數撤近鐵路區域現遠距鐵路區域之軍隊僅剩二千二百五十人（？）中國如能以其態度與好意之至誠與日本協求目下緊張之改善則日本希望能於短時期内將此所留之軍隊撤回鐵路區域芳澤繼請會衆注意滿洲之騷亂謂此足證中國官員無力遏止所轄境内之騷亂總之日政府鑒於在此人心激昻之狀態中或有不得不阻止華軍逼近日軍之危險故以爲實難確定日期撤回現留鐵路區域外最後一批之軍隊但决不能因此謂日政府無撤退軍隊之堅决意志亦不能謂日政府欲留軍隊於現戌之地俾向中國索得新讓與權或任何特殊利益</p>
<p>芳澤繼稱日政府承認其對於國聯所提出擔保之眞正效能且不能無疑日政府以爲情感緊張之終了乃絶對必要事日政府以多年艱苦之經騐深知此事已熟慮完成此種緊張終了所必要之辦法而籌出中日關係所應根據之若干基本點日政府以爲此種諒解實不可少現未有决定詳則之問題更未有日本冀向中國索取讓與權或特殊利益之問題、此爲銷釋衝突原因之問題、日本請中國有一種誠意、以給予其好意及對於良好國際諒國聯行政會通過决議草案⊙中央推張繼等五委與粤來各委商團結問題⊙居正方振武離京來滬⊙（見國内要電）美法會議開始⊙（見國外要電）市民聯合會實行檢查日貨⊙（見本埠新聞）</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>解的原因加以遵依之證據、日政府不反對於中政府願意時開始兩國間懸案之直接談判、並絶對準備答覆在此點上之建議日政府以爲關於日後談判之問題、不難由兩政府解决之、日政府以提議將談判發展情形呈報國聯行政會者、實欲銷釋日本故意拖長談判、志在延緩撤兵之任何疑慮也、日政府欲於可能的最短時間内撤回其軍隊、但日政府以爲對於任何或有之事非盡繫於其自己志願者、而限定日期、適使其有非抛棄其責任即爲世人視爲食言之危險、日政府希望國聯信任日政府之好意、及其業已證明對於國聯之忠貞云、</p>
<p>芳澤又駁覆施博士之言、謂日軍僅駐於鐵路區域外三四處、而抛擲炸彈之飛機、係偵察機、華兵曾向之射擊也、芳澤繼宣讀倫敦某報贊成日本態度之言論、又謂滿洲全境刻在混亂狀態中云、</p>
<p>施博士起立發言、謂渠不能接受日政府對於行政會草案之修正文、又謂芳澤不提出不利於日本之報紙批評、可謂謹愼之至云、</p>
<p>議長白里安於是乃起綜述中日雙方之地位、謂渠知日代表要求如撤退日軍、日人及其産業不得爲報復物、中國代表於答覆中聲明準備保障其安全、是以雙方同意應不難謀得、但尙有第二類情形、皆係兩國久未能協定之事件、如此類事件須加考慮、則十一月十六日之期限、將嫌過短不能獲有結果、此即中日完全不能同意之處、中國以不能在佔領軍壓力下考慮此種問題爲言、滿洲爭點之解决、首先繫於此困難之解决、不知日人於繕擬言及基本原則之對案時、曾有列入此類事件之意否、如有之　則整個困難、又將發生但若基本原則、指安全而言、則渠將以已得若干進步爲賀、國聯已表示盡其趨向甚難事件的解决之責任矣、如因國聯在三星期内未曾解决此事、便抨責國聯似屬不公、蓋國聯已縮小衝突之範圍亦即對於人道盡其責任以國聯所有之工具言國聯已給予應付大困難的大勇力之證據矣、如此困難之問題、决非短時所能解决、依照會章、除手續問題外、任何問題之决定、必須有行政會連案中兩造會員在内之一致同意云</p>
<p>英代表薛西爾發言、謂抛擲炸彈之事件、使英政府爲之惶擾在國際公法中、此種行爲、難以辯護、但渠可與芳澤同意者、此種事件、必在有同樣情形時、始可發生云</p>
<p>芳澤答白里安之問、謂日本對案中之基本點、意在保障日人生命與財産之安全、所有關於此後中日談判之詳情自當報告行政會、日本不反對行政會於十一月十六日集會云、今日之公開會議遂告延會、時已八時半議長白里安於會塲中人之頗大興奮中、宣告延會至星期六日午前十時半、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今晚理事會議中、當中國施總代表聲明接受提議後、日代表芳澤即提出對案内容、承認撤兵原則、但不欲規定撤兵日期、及理事會重開日期、其與理事會原案不同之點大致（一）建議中日政府立即磋商、期在安全條件下、使撤兵得以實現、（二）中日政府各派代表、規定撤兵及接收所退出各地之細則（三）中日政府以談判發展情形、及撤兵進行之條件、呈報國聯理事會（四）授權主席白里安、於審查事態後、實施渠所以爲擔　决議案充分執行所必要之計劃、並召集理事會、以使重新研究時局、施總代表即起立拒絶日本之對案、芳澤續稱中國代表之言一若滿洲全部皆爲日軍佔據者、其實日軍在鐵路區域外僅佔據三地芳澤又切實聲明滿洲之擾亂狀况、多由土匪與無拘束之華兵而起云、當辯論進行之際、施博士與芳澤間之情感、步步緊張、雙方所爭之主要點、爲日軍撤退日期、主席白里安竭力調和雙方意見、未有效果、芳澤對於滿洲擾亂情形、形容盡致、謂美員旅行於某某鐵路者、曾於登車之前、草定遺囑此言引起四座之大笑、但笑聲甫止、緊張之寂靜復作、施博士於笑聲止時、起立宣言曰、余頃所述者、無庸再加贅述、余不能接受日代表之建議、芳澤復起立曰、余重行聲明、日本不能規定撤兵日期、其日期不繫於日本、如定日期、或將令世人以爲日軍失信、故余請理事會信任日本於十二年來與國聯合作之際、表示之忠貞、芳澤繼謂、現駐鐵路區域外之日軍、僅有二千二百五十人、日本希望早日撤退之、今請中國以忠貞接受、立即與日本開外交直接談判、是時英代表薛西爾起稱、日飛機在滿洲各處、抛擲炸彈各國皆爲不安按諸國際公法實不應出此、吾人願聞其理由、薛西爾又要求芳澤、解釋日本要求在撤兵前與中國開直接談判所持之基本原則並要求芳澤說明日本之對案是否可以釋爲日本容許調查委員團前赴滿洲、芳澤答稱、基本原則意即實施　護日僑之相互的計劃、又謂日飛機在滿洲之轟擊、非出日政府之本願、實因軍事局勢不得不出此也芳澤對於薛西爾所言、派調查委員團赴滿一節置諸不答、主席白里安起稱、渠覺雙方作撤兵直接談判之基礎、今仍存在、並言宜爲大局計、而作忍耐云、芳澤繼稱、日本僅能接受草案之首三條、但不能接受第四條之規定撤兵日期者、此所以日本提出對案云、會議至九時二十五分、由主席白里安動議延會至星期六日上午十時、俾作最後之努力、便雙方同意規定撤兵日期、白里安於散會時言曰、如有必要、吾人必須得一致之同意、蓋國聯之前途唯此是賴也、（二十三日國民社電）</p>

<p>自來日人攫取東北之權利。無一不用鬼鬼崇崇之陰謀。無一不用表温和而裏很毒之手段。以前中國當局。爲此種陰謀手段所惑。不知不覺而隳其術中者多矣。今者日人又欲用此陰謀手段於日内瓦列强代表齊集公開之會場上。各國代表當亦必驚歎日人用心之陰很險詐而有所覺悟矣。所謂陰很險詐者何。即其對案中諱莫如深之基本原則四字是也。前數日東京已放出五項要求條件之空氣。而日内瓦之輿論中。亦有將信將疑若有若無之傳說。吾人早已逆知日人之以此手段爲試探。至昨日代表對案提出。而又有所謂基本原則於撤兵前須與中國先行商定之說。但此所謂基本原則。國聯方面昨已聲明絶無所聞。今日公開討論此問題。主席詰問日代表用意何在。日代表則含胡答以僅在保障日人之安全。迨他代表追問是否僅爲保障安全。則又諉爲予僅略知其意。政府尙未許其發表。再有問者。則且避而不答。夫日代表欲國聯各代表表示其本原則之承諾與否。而不以基本原則之爲如何原則示各代表。使先明瞭其眞相。已甚可駭異。况加以詰問。而仍秘而不言。其非芳澤有意玩弄各代表於股掌之上。即其内容必有非法律公道所許。而不堪爲外人道者。日人以此肆無忌憚之手段。對付國聯。固非國聯之所能忍受。即以含胡朦混之手段欺騙國聯。當亦非國聯所能容許。竊願國聯堅持其公道之主張勿使陰很險詐之日本。。得售其計</p>
<p>日人此種陰險很詐之手段。雖若極神秘不宣。然自世人觀之。當不外乎即前所放空氣之五項要求。但於此五項要求外。又安知其不另有所藉口。以圖達其目的者。故吾全國國民。尤應一致注意其所謂基本原則。無論其在五項之外與五項之内。應一致以誓死之精神。擊破其陰很險詐之手段</p>
<p>記者草此未終。又得最後消息。國聯决議案。已於大會投票通過。日本對案。亦已一致否决。國聯固已能堅持其正義。不爲强權所撓屈矣。我國人將更如何努力。與國聯協同一致。以抗此陰謀詭計之强權。</p>

<h3 id="c8">昨晨行政會討論所謂基本原則 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>英代表要求切實說明</p>
<p>芳澤表示難正式發表</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今晨理事會重行開會、日本總代表芳澤於辯論理事會决議案及日本對案之價値後、宣布渠不能接受理事會解决中日滿洲爭端之草案、理事會聞此宣言不啻青天之一霹靂、即宣布延會至午後四時、對理事會之决議案及日本之對案、均未作表决、當延會之前情勢吃緊時、西班牙代表瑪達利加加曾作謀獲同意之最後努力、提出修正文、規定雙方於日軍撤退完畢之日、即開始直接外交談判、以謀解决彼此之爭端、按「基本原則」四字、今實爲中日兩國解决爭端之障礙、日本對此四字拒絶向理事會有所解釋、理事會拒絶在日代表未將東京政府所謂「基本原開」四字作透澈之解釋前、接受日本之對案、衆視本日午後會議之最後努力、實無希望可言、芳澤答覆西班牙代表之修正文、謂日晒不能容許將「基本原則」四字在理事會中詳釋、且不能容許任何人除中國外、討論此四字、日本不能撤回對案中「基本原則」四字、白里字於是答稱、理事會未先知日本命意所在亦决不能將此四字列入决議案中、至是芳澤起曰、余當重行聲明者、日本實無藉武力解决滿案之意志、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政會今晨開會後、即集中討論於所謂基本原則之問題、日本在其對案中要求於滿洲撤兵之前、中日兩政府須有關於支配尋常關係的基本原則之協定、日本此種要求究竟意思何在、豈專注重保障其以防報復之安全乎、抑欲將兩國間意思各異已有多時之事件、歸納於基本原則中乎、英代表薛西爾請日代表切實說明此語之意味、芳澤答稱、何爲基本原則、渠略知其意、但非至日政府許其發表時、渠不能爲行政會言之、渠以爲日政府之欲在撤兵前與中國締結協定、乃當然事、日政府深知苟不如是、則日人將有被華人報復之危險也、末謂渠對於基本原則、已發充分說明云、最後白里安宣佈体會至午後四時、屆時投票决定行政會之議案及日本之對案（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日會議、十時逾數分鐘即開會、雖値大雨、旁聽者仍甚衆、議長白里安首先發言、謂此會目的、在繼續行政會草案及日本對案之討論云、</p>
<p>芳澤旋有甚重要之宣佈、謂日本對案所言及之基本原則、意在保日人之安全、其他事件爲兩國多時不能同意者、可於日後討論云云、是則基本原則之問題、遂歸入白里安昨日所謂第一類事件之内矣、</p>
<p>西班牙代表瑪達利迦以明白合理之詞、詢問基本原則是否僅與日兵撤退後日人生命安全有關、並曰余所抱憾者、日代表之說明、不能使余饜足、爲日本利益計、日代表應詳細說明此原則、庶可免將來疑問、余所慮者、日政府不僅欲和緩、但欲討論他種懸案以致和緩耳、西班牙代表並謂此問題有一容易解决之策、俟日軍撤退後、聽其自决定之直接談判、應於撤盡之日開始、撤兵久暫問題、乃可以佈置之事云、</p>
<p>薛西爾又加入辯論曰、日代表曾請其注意於報紙所載日本所欲的基本事物、即討論中日間條約問題之消息、要知報紙消息、爾我皆不負責、但余請君注意於大可研究之一事、余願宣讀路透社代表由東京發至倫敦之電報、其文曰、日本官塲以爲國聯如拒絶辦理條約神聖之問題、則不應希圖强令日本改變其地位等語、薛西爾又謂行政會未聞有提出條約問題之意、但吾人現從世界有名之新聞通信社而知日本官場竟宣佈日本不能改變其地位、想芳澤當可承認嚴重誤會或可發生、自國聯會章規定各種條約義務之尊重後、未發生條約神聖之問題、條文解釋之效力容有爭執、但此種爭執可由海牙法庭解决之現爲該法庭之主席者固日人也云、薛西爾又謂渠不見日本有何困難不能表示其意見、但此與撤兵以前先開討論之宣佈、逈不相同、依渠意思、上總統手續、確與事之層次相反云、</p>
<p>芳澤答瑪達利遲與薛西爾之言論、謂日政府準備於確知其人民與財産之安全時、即行撤兵、至於條約神聖問題、必有誤會、渠未曾以此意見電致政府也、路透消息、殊可扼腕、渠現將以此事電達政府云議長白里安結束此塲辯論、謂行政會草案之原文、係爲尊重條約之念所感動、但不可有撤兵以前長時間談判之問題、雙方間之根本異點、即在於辦理保障日人安全時所應有之事、日代表已供給許多說明、但其所說明者、依然表示關於基本原則若干漫無把握之言、芳澤爲最擁護國聯者之一、故其人非藉含混以自掩蔽之人、但在事實上確有含混之存在云、白里安又昭告芳澤曰、當行政會之討論尙未染政治菌毒時、日政府曾擔任於日本人民安全有充分保障之條件上、儘速進行業已開始之撤兵事宜、此種宣、已含有日人的安全可獲保障之承認、此問題之應解决、乃國聯尊嚴之問題云、</p>
<p>白里安繼言及國聯會章第十條、及巴黎公約第十一條、謂此條文至爲明晰、渠想日本深知其義務、但輿論難以接受直接談判以前之軍事佔據云、白里安復言及行政會屢次會議時所宣讀之報紙消息、謂渠不願引入外來之辯論與消息、渠恐日政府有將懸案引入討論中之意、但芳澤已向行政會聲明此種問題僅將在撤兵後討論之、日本之亟亟於其人民之安全、此乃極當然者、但渠知苟無軍力壓迫、事態可更入於常態中、國聯於此已對於人道大有貢獻矣云、</p>
<p>白里安於是提議日本之對案應加討論、如經拒絶、則苟非中日兩國另有方法提出、行政會之建議應加考慮、</p>
<p>瑪達利迦起謂所經討論之基本原則、未經定有界說、渠意今日殊難覓得一國、有較日本更大之榮譽心者、惟渠對於日本之態度、實覺大爲失望云、</p>
<p>於是芳澤以甚不清楚之詞作解釋曰、日政府以爲基本原則不應在行政會之議席上提出、僅應由雙方討論之、先行商妥臚列此種原則在内之一種協定、實爲絶對必要之舉、故余之不能撤銷對案中基本原則數字、且不能未得日僑安全之擔保、遽行接受行政會之决議案實不勝抱憾、惟日本殊不願以武力以求滿案之解决云、</p>
<p>瑪達利迦提議日本應撤回其對案、行政會之决議案應加修正、俾以雙方對行政會作莊重宣言之方式、予日本以更切之安全保障云、白里安乃迴面以嚮芳澤作至懇切之言曰、决議案中决不能插入意義不爲人明瞭之字句、行政會至是乃宣布延會至午後五時、今日之會議已引起此間極大之憤激、一般人士對於延長之僵局、且有驚怖之情感、　二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c9">日本怨懟英國 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>日内閣昨開特别會議</p>
<p>（東京）日本因滿案、現頗怨恨英國、據聞國聯對日態度之堅强、半因駐華英使藍溥森與英外相李定所致、朝日新聞等載有十月十七日英日兩使在寗談話之消息、謂藍溥森奉有訓令、勸日本在談判以前、退去佔據區域、藍使並稱日軍當道應許張學良復回瀋陽云、此間官塲對此消息、雖未發言、然頗憤懣、日本各報多著社論抨擊英國仇日之陰謀、謂英國欲結好於中國、俾恢復其已失之地位、故迫令國聯邀請美國參加日内瓦會議、以期以壓力加諸日本、英國竟以抛棄其對日之舊有友誼、而立於中國方面、注其勢力以迫令日本撤兵、須知英國自己現且駐兵上海、以保護英人生命財産、今乃不了解日本地位、殊不可恕云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）今晨内閣開特别會議、考慮國聯關於滿案如十一月十六日日軍撤完等之議案、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本官塲對於國聯議案之態度、似以爲如國聯拒絶辦理條約神聖之問題、則不應希圖强令日本改變其地位、日本必欲以中國之承認條約拘束爲不可少之條件、而國聯不理會之、官場乃失望而有憾意、復有考慮退出國聯之說、聞國聯秘書長德魯蒙所以决計不以日本所可接受之第一方案提交行政會者、因經過最後考慮、覺使中國依允承認一切條件拘束、乃不可能事、故决定提出第三方案、同時秘書長曾非正式向芳澤建議、日本可請海牙法庭辦理此問題、但日人以爲國聯如不肯辦理如條約神聖之根本問題則國聯全部根據即將動搖云、（二十四日路透電）</p>

<p>（南京）政府對國聯理事會關於中日問題决定草案、二十三已電令施肇基、囑表示接受、以示我國始終尊重國聯之公意、二十四特外委會開會時、對此案曾提出討論、並决定再電施使、囑請國聯、堅持草案原議、不稍退讓遷就、（二十四日專電）</p>

<p>日本堅持之主要理由</p>
<p>（東京）據可恃消息、中國前任王外長在中日領判權談判時、曾堅持日本須以南滿鐵路及遼東租借地連旅順大連在内、一併交還中國、然後中國方可依允日人有權雜居中國内地之主張、日本因此恐慌、此乃本堅持中國應承認各種條約拘束之一種主要理由（二十四日路透電）　　（東京）日政府因芳澤對於以前之訓令、顯有誤會、已訓告芳澤向國聯行政會解釋日本將一九一五年條約（指二十一條言）列入「現有之條約拘束」内、此項拘束、中國所必須承認者、又命芳澤請行政會</p>

<p>紀錄日本之五項要點、蓋芳澤在行政會會議中薛西爾提出關於日本聲明書中所述基本要點意義之質問時、未曾一一舉告也、國聯秘書長德魯蒙似曾告知芳澤、渠所以躊躇不請中國承認一九一五年條約者、蓋如以要求承認爲先决條件、則撤兵問題之解决、必將拖長時日也、德魯蒙且向芳澤建議、日本旣得中國對相互承認的條約之承認、大可知足、庶因此舍去一九一五年條約、此約中國堅稱乃受壓迫簽字、而從未加以承認者、但日代表堅定不移、謂其他列强已承認一九一五年條約之有效、故作廢一節、實不成問題、據日本之觀念、條約神聖與和平之保障、二者同爲國聯生存之本故國聯如依後項原則徇從中國之請求、則國聯亦當依前項原則接受日本之請願云、（二十四日路透電）</p>

<p>第一盤邱氏十有九敗、此中眞相、究難明瞭、或曰邱氏之積習使然、或曰邱氏先疏後熟、其理由似未充足、而事實確是如此、故一般觀衆早知第一盤之命運、預定德孚必勝、邱氏必敗、果一一索而中、惟是邱氏並非在必敗境况之下、當四比五時、稍一得勁、或能反局未定也、起初邱氏首勝二局、極引起觀衆興奮、德孚全力對付、先成二二、繼連加三局、成五比二之優勢、邱氏左右抽擊、迭中敵人要害、挽回二局、希望驟生、四比五時、德孚連勝三下、邱氏氣衰、德孚乃以六比四勝第二盤</p>

<p>抗日之聲</p>
<p>— 自在</p>
<p>東北本爲吾國之領土。乃日人口口聲聲爲保護滿蒙利權起見。進兵東北。不惜破壞東亞和平。蹂躪非戰公約。美其名曰出於自衞行動。而我東北當局。有守土之責。竟任敵人割宰。堅持所謂不抵抗主義。而欲乞國際聨盟主持公理。乃匝月以來。所謂國際聯盟之調解。盡成泡影。於此可見凡事不能求人。只有自己努力。今者國事阽危。暴日兇燄日熾。吾人苟不甘心作亡國奴。即應一致以抗日。所謂國際聯盟。等於鏡花水月。於事無補。迷夢當醒。幸母瞶瞶。</p>

<p>美國發明家愛迪生以八十四歲的老學生，於本月十八日在家裏病故。人生爲一大事來，做一大事去，像他這樣死，可算是死無遺憾了。</p>
<p>從一八六九年第一個發明宣布到一九一○年之中，他的發明，大大小小的一起算起來一共有一千三百二十八件。這個時期中他平均每十一天有一件發明。一九一○年之後他的助手加多，發明事業更是一帆順風令人望塵莫及了。</p>
<p>在這些發明中，那影響最大的當然要算電燈，電車，活動電影鏡，留聲機，有聲電影了，電話雖是貝爾Ｂell所發明，但是没有愛迪生之炭精傳音器之發明，决不能供大衆的運用。就以科學落後之中國說，在都市裏的人也没有幾個不愛受迪生之影響。我們點着電燈，坐着電車，看着電戲，聽着留聲機的時候，就得紀念這位老人家對於人類的貢獻。</p>

<p>— 乙未生</p>
<p>電氣界怪傑愛迪生。以賣報童子出身。旣未受高等敎育。亦未嘗學業於名師。惟以悟力過人。好學不倦。遂成大業而爲世界上有數之人物。美國人且尊之曰發明之王。於本年十月十八日上午三時二十四疾終於家。舉世爲之震悼。渠生平爲學。首重實騐。觀其十二歲時開始設實騐室於家中之地窖即可知。雖亦好讀書。然所讀多屬自然科學。享年八十又四去死之先一年春間。	猶向天作禱。願更活五年。以竟其未完之功。蓋彼方試騐由鼠尾草中提取橡膠之原質也。愛迪生平生多異徵。有足紀者。爲述如下。</p>
<p>渠輟學甚早。而在校時成績恒居人下。喜吸烟。且好嚼菸塊。</p>
<p>對於自己儀貌之修飾從不注意。</p>
<p>就各種職業而屢受斥革。</p>
<p>絶不注意自己之私産。</p>
<p>常作危及多人生命之化學試騐。</p>
<p>力斥每日睡眠八小時之說。</p>
<p>喜吸濃烈之黑雪茄而嚴禁其部屬吸紙卷烟。</p>
<p>對於商業事務之常識極淺薄。二十八歲之年尙不知如何以支票兌現。迨有人以兌現之法告彼。彼即以售賣市情紀錄機發明權之四萬金元支票兌取十元及五元之鈔票而終夜坐守之。竟不識將此巨欵存儲於銀行也。</p>
<p>對於保護發明權之登記毫不在意。故在此種利益上之損失數目至爲巨大。</p>
<p>不喜購置新衣。所衣恒破綻不堪。猶不輕更易。</p>
<p>晚出必衣絲質衣服。喜用一方尺大小之印度絲帕。</p>
<p>閱報時一目三行。而報中紀述即已了了於心中。</p>
<p>好諧謔。所作諧謔文必以自己爲對象。例如「我襁褓時以乳爲活而不喜之。今我又回復我之牛乳生活矣。是直可笑。」「我一生從事兩種工作。世人亦多從事兩種工作。而其一種則爲鬥紙牌也。」</p>
<p>彼以爲彼之發明白熱電燈之最大效能爲可以帮助世人之少睡。彼以爲過量食物及過量睡眠乃人類之兩大惡習。</p>
<p>愛迪生之每日睡眠僅四小時。已成爲世人之口實。然其友人法司東則承認愛迪生於白晝不常瞌睡也。</p>

<p>杭州之秋雪菴内。附有歷代兩浙詞人祠。每至深秋。蘆花盛開。潔白如雪。秋風瑟瑟。蘆花隨風俯仰。宛似白浪。煞是好看。兩浙文人。每於霜降節後。擇期舉行公祭。并宴飮而賞蘆。十八年公祭時。籌成適在武林。曾往參加。近接杭友來函。謂已叢蘆飛雪。邀往共賞。事冗不克抽身。爰將前年參加公祭詞人時之見聞。追記如下。以誌神游。</p>
<p>外省人游杭者。祗知游西湖。而不知游西溪。因西湖在錢塘門西法華秦亭諸山之陽。經人題詠。人所共知。西溪即在諸山之陰。連綿三十餘里。狹不盈丈。廣亦不過數尋。沙嶼縈廻。一覽不可盡。遍植菱蘆葦荻之屬。深秋棹小舟。約摯友。緣溪而行。一白皚皚。低壓篷背。此情此景。遠勝西湖此間有秋雪菴者。原名大聖。咸淳臨安志蕪葭深處有大聖句。即指此菴。宋淳熙初。爲資壽禪師之經别院。即以僧名名菴。厥後陳眉公擷唐詩秋雪濛釣船之意。始改今名。早經坍毁。戊午烏程周慶雲游此有感。醵金重修。并附歷代兩浙詞人祠。壬戌秋。康南海往游。曾與夏定侯等酒後聯句。當即刋碑而嵌於壁内。文曰「蘆花瑟瑟滿洲曰。花飛欲吞雲夢澤。出湖山外得清游。秋老西溪天水色。扁舟有約南海座。叨陪杖履賞秋雪。」祠内高懸「草堂之靈」四字匾額。中供歷代兩浙詞人之神位。旁附宦游流寓方外閨閣四種詞人神位。壁間所懸之聯。係朱孝臧所作。文曰「日夜歸來。此地宜有詞仙。擁素雲黄鶴。」「蘆花共色。獨客又吟愁句。對萬壑千巖。」菴内有一彈指樓。登樓可遠眺林壑深秀聳峙相望之諸山。俯視一</p>

<p>日本自以暴力侵佔東省迄今已月餘。我國仍抱不抵抗及鎭靜主義。靜待國聯解决。然國聯前後開會兩次。覘其趨勢。似已屈服於日本暴力之下。我國想像之國聯效力。實等於零。刻寗粤兩方。將在滬開和平會議。想對外方針。必有所改善。以副國人之望。並抑虹力之兇熖焉。茲將日本侵略中國及各慘案年表。錄之於后。與暴目作一總結算也。</p>
<p>萬歷二○年。（一五九二年）日本遣派陸軍十三萬人。水師九千人。攻於屬國朝鮮。此爲日本帝國主義侵略中國之始。</p>
<p>萬歷二一年。（一五九三年）朝鮮受患於日軍。乞援於明。明庭應鮮王之請。發軍往救。被日軍所敗。</p>
<p>萬歷三七年。（一六○九年）日將德川秀忠命島津家久侵我琉球。虜尙寗王。隷琉球於薩摩藩。監督其財政。且定世子年及十五必須遊底兒島之例。</p>
<p>同治一○年（一八七四年）三月間。日本政府命陸軍中將西鄉從道爲台灣事務都督。率海軍强佔台灣。並斬酋長阿祿父子以下多人。</p>
<p>光緒二年（一八七六年）二月間。日本與我屬國朝鮮訂立通商條約。迫朝鮮脫離中國爲自主國。</p>
<p>光緒五年。（一八七九年）日本政府遣宫内大臣伊籐博文。農務大臣西鄉從道來我國議朝鮮條約。我國清廷派李鴻章爲全國大臣。吳大徵副之。在天津開議。當時李鴻章等不諳外交。與日本訂立條約三欵。竟承認朝鮮爲中日共同保護國。</p>
<p>光緒二一年。（一八九五年）朝鮮東學黨事起。日本即進兵朝鮮。六月二十日。日使大鳥來介率兵入朝鮮王宫。殺衞士。虜李熙王以大院君主國事。流閔詠駿等於惡島。凡朝臣不親日者皆殺之。我國派軍往救。被日軍戰敗。於是日本以兵力脅迫我訂立馬關條約十一欵。逼我承認朝鮮爲自主國。割我台灣澎潮列島諸地。開沙市·重慶·蘇州。杭州等處爲通商口岸。並索賠欵庫銀二萬萬兩。</p>
<p>白無際皎潔若雪之蘆洲。樓中懸夏敬觀朱彊邨二聯。夏曰「暗葉啼風雨。玉塵敎林塘。」朱曰「詞客有靈應識我。西湖雖好莫題詩。」樓下有橋曰臥虹。可通蘆洲。歷代兩浙詞人。共有一千四百四十四人。自唐金華張志和起。至清陽湖劉炳照止。各人俱有傳略。刋有專册。以供展覽。祭時案上雜陳俎豆。兩旁遍列古樂。鐘鼓齊鳴。獻爵迎神。讀祝焚帛。而高唱迎送之曲。有「幽絶西溪水一方。叢蘆飛雪綻秋光。」等句。式與舊時祭孔相仿。甚爲嚴肅。</p>

<p>美軍分成兩部、性質各不相同、我爲種種原因、遂有這樣的分配、我且擬隨形勢的推移實行挹彼注此的計劃、就是减少二十師的部分以增加十師的部分、這樣、美軍總司令的弱點可望减少、惟美軍的奮勇作戰、無人能以加否認、美軍在九月十二日攻下聖米希爾之後、即於二十六日進攻亞岡、自九月二十六日以至十月二十日、美軍喪亡五萬四千一百五十八人之多、重要原因在於戰區地勢險狹、大軍廻旋艱難、而勁敵當前進攻得不償失、</p>
<p>同時、我爲促進法第四軍和美第一軍從速恢復聯合進攻及使其進攻便利起見、遂於十月二十一日作成總訓令明白規定各軍進攻的目標、和所用的戰略如下、</p>
<p>美第一軍和法第四軍右翼的總目標、爲美第一軍進至布桑西區域、和法第四軍進至勒希斯、以便自東擊破愛斯南河之綫、</p>
<p>兩軍作戰至今、已獲得完全聯絡、美軍前爲林區所阻、現可乘機出擊、兩軍會攻應認定共同目標、自東西兩面以範圍較大的行動先行攻佔亞岡高地、這樣、林中作戰得不償失的徒然犧牲可以避免、成功的步驟如下、</p>
<p>（一）美第一軍準備從速向布桑西方面實行有力的攻擊、惟須利用洛機和羅蒙之北空曠之區、而避免在亞岡和旁塞的森林裏交戰、惟有如此始能達到目標</p>
<p>（二）法第四軍一面在格蘭普萊與美軍維持聯絡、一面用大軍後疾的行動由伏齊歐攻香普、由望第特龍攻勒亞樂、直取勒希斯、竭力把戰綫開展、美軍司令和中部集團軍司令均須告知上述訓令、以便兩軍得根據計劃擴展作戰範圍、而向指定目標會師、兩軍司令如何聯絡進行、均請向我通知、我的計劃便是法美兩軍在亞岡的兩面易於行軍的區域實行擴大攻擊、</p>
<p>我遂敦促潘興司令速在苗斯河之西開始進攻、十月二十七日我寫信給他道、「美第」一軍準備在預定日期、即十一月一日「開始進攻最關重要、且須繼續前進直至大功告成而後已、」</p>
<p>我並爲規定、美第一軍在十一月十一日進攻後、須繼續挺進、直至佔領布桑西始停顿、</p>
<p>法第四軍十月十三日以來在伏齊歐之東的發展使美軍作戰便利、法軍在愛斯南河右岸望第和發萊之間確定了橋頭堡、牽制亞岡區域裏大隊德軍、美軍所受的壓力因之大减、</p>
<p>美軍因於十一月一日開始進攻、第一日即攻佔布桑尼·斯敦尼路·一帶敵軍陣地、左翼、法第四軍也擴展至愛斯南河之東、我遂令法美兩軍乘勝向塞塘和美齊歐方面進取、（未完）</p>

<p>上海新聲通信社出版部、把日本田中内閣侵略滿蒙積極政策、翻成了一本小册子、最近已經出版了、我讀了這本小册子之後、不禁驚心動魄、覺著這本小册子裏每一句、每一個字、都有實質的、而每一句、每一個字、都可以亡中國的、這十多天來、日本軍隊强佔了我們遼吉兩省的重要地方、鼓吹滿蒙獨立、幹出許許多多無法無天的事情、完全是承受了田中内閣的衣鉢、把這本小册子的計劃一一二二地實行着、在這國難當頭、需要着知己知彼的時候、這樣的書、不能不把介紹出來、請看他丨田中義一丨在這奏議上劈頭就說、</p>
<p>「我帝國因欲開拓其富源、以培養恒久之榮華、特設南滿洲鐵道會社、藉日支共存共榮之美名而投資於其地之鐵道、鑛山·森林·鋼鐵·農業·畜産等達四億四千餘萬元、蟕誠我國企業中最雄大之組織也、且名爲半官半民、其實權無不操之政府、若夫付滿鐵公司以外交·警察·及一般之政權、使其發揮帝國主義、形成特殊會社、無異朝鮮統監之第二」</p>
<p>哦、你看他怎樣的野心、老早把滿蒙看作朝鮮第二了、他想永遠把滿蒙攫取到自己的手裏、便採取下面寫着的手段、「且東三省爲東亞政治不完全之地、我日人爲欲自保而保他人、必須以鐵與血方能拔除東亞的難局、然欲以鐵與血主義而保東三省、則第三國之阿美利加必受支那以夷制之夷煽動而制我、斯時也、我之對美角逐、勢不容辭、」「將來欲制支那、必以打倒美國勢力爲先决問題、與日俄戰爭之意大同小異、」</p>
<p>現在日本不宣而戰、强佔東北各要地、不就是實行他的鐵血主義麽、所以用這種迅雷不及掩耳的手段、强行霸佔、不就是想使第三國丨丨阿美利加來不及制裁他們麽、上月二十九日華盛頓來電、　美國各報因日人竭力宣傳、已改變論調、不贊成美國及國際聯盟採取干涉政策、不就是表明他們早有計劃來應付第三國的阿利加麽、在這時、不就是慶祝著「欲征服支那、必先征服滿蒙、如欲征服世界、必先征服支那」的預計成功麽、他在第二節「滿蒙非支那領土」上說、</p>
<p>「茲所謂滿蒙者、依歷史非支那之領土、亦非支那特殊區域、我矢野博士盡力研究支那歷史、無不以滿蒙非支那之領土、此事已由帝國大學發表於世界矣、因我矢野博士之研究發表正當、故支那學者無反對我帝國大學之立說也、」</p>
<p>記者寡陋、不幸没有看過矢野博士之立說、據他說、我們中國學者没有反對過這種立說、如果是眞的話、則我們治歷史地理學的學者們、誠不能辭其咎、而國家費了許多錢剏設的歷史語言研究所、不知所幹的是什麽事了、現在日本便根據這些理由、大吹大擂地實行鼓吹滿蒙獨立了、田中義一的徒子徒孫、眞是青出于藍啊、</p>
<p>他在「朝鮮移民奬勵及保護政策」一節中、有這樣的話、「按在滿蒙之朝鮮人、如擴張至二百五十萬人以上者、得於有事之秋、則以朝鮮民爲原子、而作軍事活動、更藉取締爲名、而援助其行動、加之、鮮民中之在滿蒙有歸化爲支那民、而亦有未歸化者、斯時事到之日、是支那籍之鮮民作亂、可以懸羊頭賣狗肉之方策對付之、」看了這番話、則萬案事件、可以瞭如指掌、而其陰謀詭計、則足令人切齒痛恨也、還有更會使你看了撟舌不下的陰謀、</p>
<p>「我對赤俄之進出、非盡力防避不可、必須須藉奉天政府爲楔子、而阻其勢力南下、我第一着手、籍防赤俄南下爲題、以得寸進尺之　法而强進北滿地盤、以便攫取其富源、南可制支那勢力之北上、北可制赤俄勢力南下、如欲與赤俄爲政治或經濟角逐者、必須驅支那爲前驅、我只可督支那於背後、以防避赤俄之伸張、而我方另以秘密方法與赤俄提携、而制支那勢力之增長、而免妨害我滿鐵之旣得權、」</p>
<p>哦原年前中東之役、日本嚴守中立、就是有這種因緣、我國以後眞要提心弔膽、提防上他這種當啊、關於「新大陸開拓與滿蒙鐵道」的計劃、他有這樣的話、二支那民族頗多　其國防土、經濟上頗不利於我、就我欲開拓其富源、及展拓其國防者、毾須極力建築北滿鐵道依其鐵道之開通、可移多數國民於北滿、以便製肘南滿之政治及經濟、而可强固我國國防、以奠定東亞大局、加之、南滿鐵道旣成之綫路、多以經濟爲目的、致缺循環綫路、頗不利於戰時之動員及軍需之搬運、此後必須以軍事爲目的、建設滿蒙大循環綫、而可包圍滿蒙中心地、以制支那之軍事政治及經濟之發達、亦可防杜俄勢之侵入、此乃我國之新大陸造成上必要之關鍵也　　　因此、他便要實現完成下列的鐵路、（一）通遼熱河間鐵路、（二）洮南至索倫間鐵路、（三）長洮鐵路之一部鐵路、（四）吉會鐵路、（五）琿春至海林鐵路、現在他們强佔我們的領土、固可爲所欲爲、但交涉的時候、他們最低限度必要求這些鐵路的商租權、我們記住、這些路綫是「戰時之動員及軍需之搬運、」足以「制中國軍事政治及經濟之發達」的路綫、我們要用强硬的外交手段、誓不能給他們的、</p>

<p>Opposing Setting a Date for Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>Insisting on the So-Called Fundamental Principles</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a meeting tonight. The Japanese Chief Delegate, Yoshizawa, made the members wait and arrived on time, shaking hands affably with each member. The gallery was still extremely crowded, all eager to witness the final scene of the unprecedented drama unfolding in Geneva. The Chinese Chief Delegate, Dr. Shi Zhaoqi, arrived last, and the meeting began at 6:20 PM. The Chairman, Briand, stood up and read the Japanese government's reply to the note of the Kellogg-Briand Pact signatories to both China and Japan. He then explained the reasons why both the Chinese and Japanese delegations requested postponement of the meeting in order to consult their respective governments regarding the resolution of the Administrative Council. Briand then asked the Chinese and Japanese representatives to state whether they were now in a position to discuss the resolution.</p>
<p>Dr. Shi Zhaoqi then stood up amidst complete silence and addressed the assembly, stating that the Chinese government had originally hoped that the Administrative Council could enable the withdrawal of Japanese troops to be realized soon. However, after a month, even with the presence of the American representative at the Administrative Council, the situation had not changed slightly. He feared that public opinion would be shocked that the American representative who advised the Administrative Council had failed to find a solution, and that prolonged delays would inevitably affect the position of the League of Nations. However, he was willing to yield to the wishes of the Administrative Council and accept its resolution as the first step towards understanding. He now understood that the Administrative Council would reconvene on November 16th, and that the withdrawal of Japanese troops must be completed by that date.</p>
<p>Dr. Shi continued to express his opinion that the delay in the withdrawal of Japanese troops was too long, as five weeks had passed since the occupation of the territory. He had received a telegram from his government this morning stating that Japanese aircraft were again dropping bombs in various places. Furthermore, every hour that passed was enough to cause regrettable incidents. The Chinese government was willing to continue implementing plans to protect Japanese residents in China, but the prolonged occupation of Japanese troops would prolong anti-Japanese sentiment. The withdrawal of Japanese troops would bring about a very beneficial change in public opinion.</p>
<p>One more point must be stated to the Administrative Council: the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Manchuria should naturally include all troops and paramilitary forces such as police, military police, and aircraft. Furthermore, the Chinese property occupied by the Japanese army since September 18th should be fully returned to Chinese officials, and restrictions on Chinese banks should be terminated immediately.</p>
<p>Dr. Shi concluded by saying that he believed that after the withdrawal of Japanese troops, the responsibility for the September 18th Incident should be determined. Any future discussions between China and other powers must be based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the League of Nations Charter, and the 1922 Washington Treaty. After Dr. Shi's address, Chairman Briand began reading the Japanese government's counter-proposal. The first three sections of the counter-proposal were the same as the first three sections of the Administrative Council's resolution, except that the first sentence of the first section read, "It is understood that this declaration conforms to the spirit of the League of Nations Charter." The sections from the fourth section onwards were completely different from the League of Nations resolution. The fourth section recorded the Japanese representative's declaration of October 13th, according to which the Japanese government would implement the understanding previously reached between the Chinese and Japanese governments on the fundamental principles governing their normal relations, so that emotions could be eased and tensions could end before proceeding to the withdrawal of troops into the railway area. The so-called fundamental principles were to grant Japanese people the security of life and the protection of their property. The fifth section requested the Chinese and Japanese governments to immediately consult in order to establish this understanding. The sixth section requested the governments of China and Japan to each send representatives to agree on the details of implementing the withdrawal of troops and receiving the territories withdrawn from. The seventh section requested the governments of the two countries to report to the Administrative Council the development of negotiations between the two countries and the progress in the implementation of the current resolution. The eighth section authorized the Chairman of the Administrative Council to implement all plans deemed necessary to guarantee the implementation of the current resolution after reviewing the aforementioned documents, and to convene meetings at any time to continue reviewing the situation in Manchuria.</p>
<p>After Briand read the Japanese counter-proposal, he continued by saying that he had spoken with Yoshizawa this morning. Yoshizawa had informed him of the Japanese government's objections to several items in the Administrative Council's resolution and expressed the Japanese government's willingness to follow the format of the draft resolution. Yoshizawa had also given him a memorandum listing these conditions, containing so many amendments that it was practically a counter-proposal. This had to be debated immediately, so the public meeting of the Administrative Council was convened.</p>
<p>Yoshizawa then stood up and commented on the draft resolution of the Administrative Council, saying that the Japanese government could not determine the date of troop withdrawal. The deployment of Japanese troops in Manchuria was not intended to exert pressure on China, but was only a necessary measure in the current situation. Yoshizawa then thanked the Administrative Council for its tireless efforts to avert the danger of war and to maintain the principles and dignity of the League of Nations, saying that the Japanese government was deeply aware of this responsibility. The Japanese government had never dreamed of infringing on peace, but had taken self-defense measures to maintain peace and security because it and its people were in a very painful environment. This did not contain any intention of aggression or hostility. Allowing troops to go beyond the railway area was only to implement the plans essential to fulfilling its protection responsibilities, and from the beginning it had tried to avoid aggravating the situation.</p>
<p>Yoshizawa also firmly stated that Japan had no territorial ambitions in Manchuria and intended to withdraw its troops as soon as the situation allowed for withdrawal without danger. Moreover, the withdrawal of troops had already begun, and more than half of the troops originally sent outside the railway area had now been withdrawn closer to the railway area. The remaining troops far from the railway area numbered only two thousand two hundred and fifty. If China could sincerely cooperate with Japan to improve the current tension, Japan hoped to withdraw these remaining troops back to the railway area in a short period of time. Yoshizawa then asked the assembly to pay attention to the riots in Manchuria, saying that this proved that Chinese officials were unable to quell the riots within their jurisdiction. In summary, the Japanese government believed that in this state of heightened emotions, there might be a danger of having to prevent Chinese troops from approaching Japanese troops, so it was difficult to determine the date for withdrawing the last batch of troops remaining outside the railway area. But this could not be said to mean that the Japanese government had no firm will to withdraw troops, nor could it be said that the Japanese government wanted to keep troops in their current positions in order to demand new concessions or any special interests from China.</p>
<p>Yoshizawa continued by saying that the Japanese government recognized its doubts about the genuine effectiveness of the guarantees proposed by the League of Nations. The Japanese government believed that an end to emotional tension was absolutely necessary. The Japanese government, with many years of hard experience, knew this matter well and had deliberated on the measures necessary to end this tension and had come up with several fundamental points on which Sino-Japanese relations should be based. The Japanese government believed that this kind of understanding was essential. There was no question of deciding on detailed rules now, nor was there any question of Japan hoping to extract concessions or special interests from China; this was a question of resolving the causes of conflict. Japan asked China for a kind of sincerity, to give evidence of its good intentions and its reasons for complying with the understanding of good international relations. The Japanese government did not object to the start of direct negotiations between the two countries on outstanding issues when the Chinese government was willing, and was absolutely prepared to respond to suggestions on this point. The Japanese government believed that the problem of future negotiations would be easily resolved by the two governments. The Japanese government's proposal to report the development of negotiations to the League of Nations Administrative Council was intended to dispel any suspicion that Japan was deliberately prolonging negotiations with the aim of delaying the withdrawal of troops. The Japanese government wanted to withdraw its troops in the shortest possible time, but the Japanese government believed that setting a date for anything that did not depend entirely on its own will would put it in danger of abandoning its responsibilities or being seen as breaking its word. The Japanese government hoped that the League of Nations would trust the Japanese government's good intentions and its proven loyalty to the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Yoshizawa also refuted Dr. Shi's statement, saying that Japanese troops were only stationed outside the railway area in three or four places, and that the aircraft that dropped bombs were reconnaissance planes that had been fired upon by Chinese soldiers. Yoshizawa then read out the comments of a London newspaper supporting Japan's attitude, and added that the entire territory of Manchuria was currently in a state of chaos.</p>
<p>Dr. Shi stood up and said that he could not accept the Japanese government's amendments to the Administrative Council's draft, and added that Yoshizawa's failure to present unfavorable newspaper criticisms of Japan was the height of discretion.</p>
<p>Chairman Briand then rose to summarize the positions of China and Japan, saying that he knew that the Japanese representative had requested that if Japanese troops were withdrawn, Japanese people and their property should not be subject to retaliation. The Chinese representative had stated in his reply that he was prepared to guarantee their safety, so it should not be difficult to reach an agreement between the two sides. But there was also a second type of situation, all of which were incidents that the two countries had long failed to agree on. If such incidents had to be considered, then the deadline of November 16 would be too short to achieve results. This was the point on which China and Japan could not agree at all. China said that it could not consider this kind of problem under the pressure of occupying forces. The solution of the Manchurian dispute depended first of all on the solution of this difficulty. He did not know whether the Japanese had intended to include this kind of incident when drafting the counter-proposal that mentioned fundamental principles. If so, the whole difficulty would arise again. But if the fundamental principle referred to security, then he would congratulate himself on having made some progress. The League of Nations had expressed its responsibility to strive for the resolution of very difficult incidents. It seemed unfair to criticize the League of Nations for not having resolved this matter in three weeks, because the League of Nations had reduced the scope of the conflict and had also fulfilled its responsibilities to humanity. With all the instruments at its disposal, the League of Nations had given evidence of great courage in dealing with great difficulties. Such difficult problems could not be solved in a short time. According to the Charter, apart from procedural issues, any decision must have the unanimous consent of the members of the Administrative Council, including the two parties in the case.</p>
<p>The British representative, Cecil, spoke and said that the bombing incident had alarmed the British government. Under international law, this kind of conduct was difficult to defend, but he could agree with Yoshizawa that this kind of incident must have occurred in similar circumstances.</p>
<p>Yoshizawa replied to Briand's question that the fundamental point in the Japanese counter-proposal was to guarantee the safety of Japanese people's lives and property. All details regarding future Sino-Japanese negotiations should be reported to the Administrative Council. Japan did not object to the Administrative Council meeting on November 16th. Today's public meeting was adjourned, and the chairman, Briand, announced the adjournment to 10:30 AM on Saturday amidst considerable excitement in the venue. (Reuters telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) During this evening's council meeting, after the Chinese Chief Delegate Shi declared his acceptance of the proposal, the Japanese representative Yoshizawa presented the content of the counterproposal, acknowledging the principle of troop withdrawal but unwilling to specify a date for withdrawal or the date for the resumption of the council meeting. The points where it differed from the original council proposal were roughly: (1) suggesting that the Chinese and Japanese governments immediately consult to enable the withdrawal of troops under safe conditions, (2) the governments of China and Japan each sending representatives to stipulate the details for the withdrawal of troops and the reception of the territories withdrawn from, (3) the governments of China and Japan reporting to the League of Nations Council the development of negotiations and the conditions for the progress of troop withdrawal, (4) authorizing the Chairman, Briand, to implement, after examining the situation, the plans he deems necessary to ensure the full implementation of the resolution, and to convene the Council to re-examine the situation. Chief Delegate Shi then stood up to reject the Japanese counterproposal. Yoshizawa continued, stating that the Chinese representative's words were as if all of Manchuria was occupied by Japanese troops, whereas in reality Japanese troops only occupied three places outside the railway area. Yoshizawa also firmly stated that the disturbances in Manchuria were mostly caused by bandits and unrestrained Chinese soldiers. As the debate progressed, the emotions between Dr. Shi and Yoshizawa gradually intensified. The main point of contention between the two sides was the date of the withdrawal of Japanese troops. Chairman Briand exerted great efforts to reconcile the views of both sides, without effect. Yoshizawa described the chaotic situation in Manchuria in detail, saying that a US official traveling on a certain railway had drafted his will before boarding the train. This statement caused a great burst of laughter from all sides, but as soon as the laughter subsided, a tense silence resumed. Dr. Shi, when the laughter had stopped, stood up and declared, "There is no need for me to elaborate further on what I have said. I cannot accept the Japanese representative's proposal." Yoshizawa rose again and said, "I reiterate that Japan cannot stipulate a date for the withdrawal of troops; the date does not depend on Japan. If a date is set, it may lead the world to believe that the Japanese army has broken its word. Therefore, I ask the Council to trust the loyalty that Japan has demonstrated in its cooperation with the League of Nations over the past twelve years." Yoshizawa continued, saying that there were only 2,250 Japanese troops currently stationed outside the railway area. Japan hoped to withdraw them as soon as possible. He now asked China to accept this in good faith and to immediately commence direct diplomatic negotiations with Japan. At this time, the British representative, Cecil, rose and said that the fact that Japanese aircraft were dropping bombs in various places in Manchuria was causing unease in all countries, and that it was not permissible under international law. "We would like to hear the reason for this." Cecil also asked Yoshizawa to explain the fundamental principles that Japan insisted on in opening direct negotiations with China before the withdrawal of troops, and asked Yoshizawa to explain whether Japan's counterproposal could be interpreted as Japan allowing the investigation committee to go to Manchuria. Yoshizawa replied, "The fundamental principles mean implementing mutual plans to protect the Japanese residents." He also said that the bombing of Manchuria by Japanese aircraft was not the government's intention, but was necessitated by the military situation. Yoshizawa did not answer the question from Cecil regarding the dispatch of an investigation committee to Manchuria. Chairman Briand rose and said, "I feel that the basis for direct negotiations between the two sides on troop withdrawal still exists." He also said that for the sake of the overall situation, patience should be exercised. Yoshizawa continued by saying that Japan could only accept the first three articles of the draft, but could not accept the fourth article, which stipulated the date of troop withdrawal. This was why Japan had put forward a counterproposal. The meeting was adjourned at 9:25, with Chairman Briand moving to adjourn the meeting until 10:00 AM on Saturday to make a final effort to get both sides to agree on a date for troop withdrawal. Briand said at the adjournment, "If necessary, we must obtain unanimous consent, as the future of the League of Nations depends on this." (National News Agency Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Shi Zhaoqi's Speech in the League of Nations Administrative Council <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Geneva, 24th telegram, At today's open meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, the Chinese representative, Shi Zhaoqi, gave a lengthy speech, the text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>The Chinese government hopes that the League of Nations Administrative Council can resolve the issue of the rapid and complete withdrawal of Japanese troops. The majority of the three eastern provinces have been occupied by Japanese troops for more than a month. Although the League of Nations Administrative Council has continued discussions from September 23rd to September 30th, and from October 13th to today, and the US government has cooperated with the League of Nations and sent representatives to participate, and notified the League of Nations not to give up, and to make every effort to deal with this incident, the US government has also agreed to take unilateral action to provide diplomatic assistance to the League of Nations' actions, and at the same time stated that the United States has paid full attention to this, and that China and Japan should bear obligations to other signatory countries of the non-war pact and the Nine-Power Treaty, but the Japanese army continues to occupy the area. In terms of public opinion, there is a constant sense of impatience. I fear that public opinion, in view of the situation of the past five weeks and today, will believe that if the cooperation of the United States and the League of Nations cannot, within five weeks, order a member state and a party to the non-war pact to withdraw the troops who have illegally invaded the land of another member state and a contracting party, then the organization for maintaining peace must be incompletely organized, or all civilized countries must lack the determination to make the organization more efficient. If this kind of emerging mentality is established, then its impact on the future of the disarmament conference and the cooperation between the United States and the League of Nations is self-evident, and must be something we regret. Therefore, I express my opinion on this kind of delay and hesitation, and I share the same regret as my colleagues in the Administrative Council. This incident is the most serious matter since the establishment of the League of Nations and will be a test of how countries view the League of Nations' credibility. Since the United States is willing to be the backing for the League of Nations' actions, and world opinion has unanimously expressed its willingness to support any effective action that can maintain international peace, then our actions should be very careful. Although the organization for maintaining world peace is slow, there are several parts that have not yet been tested, but its power can cover everything, and its efficiency can continue to increase. For all these reasons, I express my regret for this kind of delay, but I still express obedience to the positions that the Administrative Council deems necessary. At the same time, although the Chinese government believes that the resolution has failed to resolve the most important points and the current crisis, it still authorizes me to accept this resolution. We accept this resolution only as a current stage in the League of Nations' handling of this issue, and because this resolution is the final result of lengthy discussions by all member states and is publicly recommended to us, its main points must be recognized as fixed, and the modifications that can be made are limited to details. Now I will further state the views of the Chinese government in accepting this resolution. The Chinese government believes that the key point of this resolution is the provision that the Administrative Council will reconvene on November 16th, and that it urges the Japanese government to immediately withdraw its troops in an orderly manner, so as to completely withdraw them before the reconvening, and that it is the responsibility of the Chinese government to appoint representatives to jointly inspect the procedures for receiving the areas withdrawn by the Japanese army, and to guarantee the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in those areas. The Chinese government believes that the troop withdrawal deadline stipulated in the resolution is too long. According to the resolution, the extension of the troop withdrawal deadline will be another month, during which time there will be danger every day. This morning, I also reported to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations Chen that in the last two days, there had been three more instances of Japanese aircraft dropping bombs. There is always an extremely dangerous situation at any time, with the danger that could hinder a rapid and peaceful resolution. However, the Chinese government is determined to accept the proposal and declares that it is prepared to fulfill the obligations imposed on China by this proposal. The Chinese government not only accepts, but is willing to go a step further and do its utmost to eliminate the doubts about the safety of the lives and property of Japanese in the areas currently being accepted. I believe that these doubts are unfounded. The Chinese government believes that the phenomena of disorder and unrest in the occupied areas are caused by the occupation by Japanese troops. This kind of unrest will increase with the number of days of occupation and decrease with the withdrawal of Japanese troops. However, as a matter of courtesy, I must declare that I firmly believe that the Japanese government's concerns are not false. However, I also hope that the Japanese representative will trust the Chinese government's sincere desire to dispel this concern. The Chinese government's desire for this is very enthusiastic. Not only do I accept the participation of military attachés from neutral countries in the reception as stipulated in the resolution, and prepare to give progressive guarantees to the Japanese representative and the League of Nations Administrative Council, but the Chinese government, in order to prevent the Japanese government from doubting that Japanese residents will be endangered because Japan withdraws its troops in accordance with the League of Nations resolution, is willing to immediately consider, in a very friendly spirit, any proposals to expand the organization of military attachés from neutral countries, or any other methods formulated with the assistance of the League of Nations to effectively protect the lives and property of Japanese residents in the accepted areas. I understand that the meaning of troop withdrawal and accepting withdrawn areas in the resolution refers to all Japanese troops and paramilitary constables, police, all kinds of aircraft, and the return of all public and private property owned by China confiscated by Japanese troops after September 18th and the cancellation of the Chinese officials, people, banks, and businesses.</p>

<h3 id="e6">The So-Called Fundamental Principles of the Japanese <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Since ancient times, the Japanese have seized rights in the Northeast using nothing but cunning conspiracies and nothing but seemingly gentle but inwardly vicious means. In the past, Chinese authorities were deceived by such conspiracies and tactics, and many unknowingly fell into their trap. Now, the Japanese are again attempting to use such conspiracies and tactics in the open arena where the powerful representatives of Geneva are gathered. The representatives of various countries will surely be amazed by the Japanese's sinister and treacherous intentions and become aware. What is meant by sinister and treacherous? It is the heavily veiled phrase "fundamental principles" in their counterproposal. Several days ago, Tokyo had already released the atmosphere of five demands, and there were also rumors in the Geneva discourse that were half believed and half doubted. We had long anticipated that the Japanese would use this tactic for probing. Until yesterday, when the representatives' counterproposal was presented, there was again talk of so-called fundamental principles that must first be negotiated with China before the troop withdrawal. However, the League of Nations had stated yesterday that it had heard absolutely nothing about these so-called fundamental principles. Today, in the open discussion of this issue, the chairman questioned the Japanese representative's intentions. The Japanese representative evasively replied that it was only to ensure the safety of the Japanese. When other representatives pressed him on whether it was only to ensure safety, he shifted the blame, saying that he only knew a little about their meaning and that the government had not yet permitted him to disclose it. When asked further, he avoided answering. That the Japanese representative wanted the League of Nations representatives to indicate their commitment to the fundamental principles without showing the representatives what the fundamental principles were, so that they could first understand the truth, was already extremely shocking. Moreover, when pressed, he still kept it a secret. It was either Yoshizawa intentionally playing the representatives in the palm of his hand, or the content must contain something not permitted by law and justice and could not be divulged to outsiders. The Japanese using such unscrupulous means to deal with the League of Nations was certainly unacceptable to the League of Nations, and deceiving the League of Nations with vague and confusing means was also something the League of Nations could not allow. We secretly hope that the League of Nations will adhere to its just claims and not allow the sinister and treacherous Japanese to succeed in their plot.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese's sinister and treacherous means seem extremely mysterious and undisclosed, in the eyes of the world, it must be nothing more than the five demands released earlier. But in addition to these five demands, how can we know that they will not make other excuses to achieve their goals? Therefore, our entire nation should pay particular attention to these so-called fundamental principles. Whether they are outside the five demands or within the five demands, we should unite with a spirit of swearing to die to break their sinister and treacherous means.</p>
<p>Before this reporter finished drafting, he received the latest news. The League of Nations resolution has been passed by a vote in the assembly. The Japanese counterproposal has also been unanimously rejected. The League of Nations has been able to uphold its justice and has not been swayed by the power of the strong. How will our people work harder, unite with the League of Nations, and resist this powerful power of conspiracy and trickery?</p>
<h3 id="e7">Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Regarding any restrictions on industrial organizations, in short, the original situation before the incident should be fully restored. The current request is for the League of Nations Administrative Council and the U.S. representative to indicate their acceptance of the invitation to be sent by the Chinese government, and to appoint representatives to jointly implement the fourth item of the resolution with the Chinese government. The Chinese government considers the following points to be the most important: that the withdrawal of troops in the sixth item of the resolution is the most important issue for the Administrative Council at present. Other matters will not be discussed until the troop withdrawal is completed. However, another point that must be clarified is that the Chinese government believes that in addition to the troop withdrawal issue, there are also issues of responsibility and the estimated losses of the Chinese side after September 18th. From the beginning, the Chinese government has been willing to hand this matter over to a neutral third country for decision in accordance with the principles of the League of Nations. However, using the occupation of Manchuria as an opportunity to forcibly resolve other demands is contrary to the spirit of the Covenant and violates Article 2 of the Pact of Paris. Under the oppression of armed occupation, or under conditions created by force, China will never negotiate any issues with any country. This point is the foundation for the establishment of the League of Nations and the Pact of Paris. The Chinese government believes that this is a fundamental issue and therefore makes this special solemn declaration. The Chinese government is confident that by adhering to this attitude, it will receive unconditional moral assistance from all members of the League of Nations and all parties to the Pact of Paris. Any negotiations between China and any country on any issue must be conducted based on China's inherent rights and obligations under the Covenant and the Pact of Paris, and must respect the principles governing the relationship between China and other countries as stipulated in the Washington Conference. Regarding this matter, I would like to</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>make an extremely clear and solemn declaration. Once this unfortunate incident is resolved and normal relations are restored, it will be known that the Chinese government is not only willing but also eagerly hopes to negotiate all issues between China and Japan in a spirit of great friendship. China's only wish is to live in peace with all countries, especially to be on friendly terms with its neighbors. It is also hoped that although the two countries have been greatly agitated and appealed to the League of Nations this time, this agitation may lead both sides to resolutely seek an improvement in the relationship between the two countries in the future and seek to build a foundation for permanent peace in the Far East. In this spirit, the Chinese government welcomes the Administrative Council's proposal to establish a permanent reconciliation committee or similar mechanism. Furthermore, I can assure the League of Nations that the Chinese government will not only carefully abide by all obligations within the public law of the League of Nations to promote good neighborly relations with Japan, but will also strive to shift the thinking of its people towards peace and friendship in order to forget the painful past and hope for a better future.

<h3 id="e8">The Executive Yuan Discussed the So-Called Basic Principles Yesterday Morning <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>British Representative Demands a Clear Explanation</p>
<p>Yoshizawa Indicates It Is Difficult to Officially Announce</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council reconvened this morning. After debating the value of the Council's resolution and Japan's counter-proposal, Yoshizawa, the chief Japanese representative, announced that he could not accept the Council's draft resolution for resolving the Sino-Japanese Manchurian dispute. The Council was struck by this declaration like a bolt from the blue and immediately announced a postponement until 4 p.m. No vote was taken on either the Council's resolution or Japan's counter-proposal. When the situation became tense before the postponement, the Spanish representative, Madariaga, made a final effort to reach an agreement and proposed an amendment stipulating that direct diplomatic negotiations should begin between the two sides on the day the Japanese troops completed their withdrawal, in order to resolve their disputes. The term "basic principles" is now a real obstacle to resolving the dispute between China and Japan. Japan refused to explain these four words to the Council. The Council refused to accept Japan's counter-proposal until the Japanese representative had thoroughly explained the meaning of the four words "basic principles" as mentioned by the Tokyo government. The final efforts of this afternoon's meeting are generally seen as hopeless. Yoshizawa replied to the Spanish representative's amendment, saying that Japan could not allow the detailed explanation of the four words "basic principles" in the Council, and could not allow anyone other than China to discuss these four words. Japan cannot withdraw the four words "basic principles" from its counter-proposal. Briand then replied that the Council could not include these four words in the resolution without first knowing the Japanese intent. At this point, Yoshizawa rose and said, "I must reiterate that Japan has no intention of resolving the Manchurian issue by force." (24th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the League of Nations Administrative Council met this morning, it focused on the issue of the so-called basic principles. In its counter-proposal, Japan requested that the Chinese and Japanese governments have an agreement on the basic principles governing ordinary relations before the withdrawal of troops from Manchuria. What exactly does Japan mean by this request? Is it solely focused on guaranteeing its own safety against retaliation, or does it intend to include events between the two countries that have differed for a long time in the basic principles? The British representative, Cecil, asked the Japanese representative to clearly explain the meaning of this phrase. Yoshizawa replied that he knew the meaning of the basic principles to some extent, but he could not speak for the Administrative Council until the Japanese government allowed him to announce it. He believed that it was only natural for the Japanese government to conclude an agreement with China before the withdrawal of troops. The Japanese government is well aware that if this is not the case, Japanese people will be in danger of being retaliated against by the Chinese. Finally, he said that he had given a sufficient explanation of the basic principles. Briand then announced an adjournment until 4 p.m., at which time a vote would be taken to decide on the Administrative Council's draft resolution and Japan's counter-proposal. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today's meeting began a few minutes after 10 a.m. Although it was raining heavily, there were still many observers. President Briand spoke first, saying that the purpose of this meeting was to continue the discussion of the Administrative Council's draft and Japan's counter-proposal.</p>
<p>Yoshizawa then made a very important announcement, saying that the basic principles mentioned in Japan's counter-proposal were intended to protect the safety of the Japanese people, and that other events that the two countries had been unable to agree on for a long time could be discussed later. Thus, the issue of basic principles was included in what Briand called the first category of events yesterday.</p>
<p>The Spanish representative, Madariaga, asked in clear and reasonable terms whether the basic principles were only related to the safety of Japanese lives after the withdrawal of Japanese troops, and said that he regretted that the Japanese representative's explanation could not satisfy him. For the sake of Japan's interests, the Japanese representative should explain these principles in detail to avoid future doubts. What he worried about was that the Japanese government not only wanted to ease the situation, but also wanted to discuss other outstanding issues in order to ease the situation. The Spanish representative also said that there was an easy solution to this problem. After the Japanese troops withdrew, they should be allowed to decide on direct negotiations, which should begin on the day of the withdrawal. The length of the withdrawal period could be arranged.</p>
<p>Cecil also joined the debate, saying that the Japanese representative had asked him to pay attention to the news in the newspapers about the basic things that Japan wanted, that is, the news about discussing the treaty issue between China and Japan. He wanted to know that we are not responsible for the news in the newspapers, but I would like to ask you to pay attention to a matter that can be studied greatly. I would like to read a telegram sent from Tokyo to London by the Reuters representative. The text said that Japanese officials believe that if the League of Nations refuses to deal with the issue of the sanctity of treaties, it should not try to force Japan to change its position, etc. Cecil also said that the Administrative Council had not heard of any intention to raise the issue of treaties, but we now know from a world-famous news agency that Japanese officials have announced that Japan cannot change its position. I think Yoshizawa can admit that a serious misunderstanding may occur. Since the League of Nations Charter stipulates the respect for various treaty obligations, the issue of the sanctity of treaties has not arisen. The effectiveness of the interpretation of the provisions may be disputed, but this dispute can be resolved by the Hague Court. The current chairman of the court is a Japanese. Cecil also said that he did not see any difficulty for Japan in expressing its opinions, but this is completely different from the announcement of discussions before the withdrawal of troops. In his opinion, the presidential procedure is definitely the opposite of the order of events.</p>
<p>Yoshizawa replied to Madariaga and Cecil's remarks, saying that the Japanese government was prepared to withdraw its troops as soon as it was sure of the safety of its people and property. As for the issue of the sanctity of treaties, there must be a misunderstanding. He had not telegraphed this opinion to the government. The Reuters news was very regrettable. He would now telegraph this matter to the government. President Briand ended the debate, saying that the original text of the Administrative Council's draft was moved by the idea of respecting treaties, but there should be no long-term negotiations before the withdrawal of troops. The fundamental difference between the two sides lies in what should be done to protect the safety of the Japanese people. The Japanese representative has provided many explanations, but what he explained still shows some vague remarks about basic principles. Yoshizawa is one of the most ardent supporters of the League of Nations, so he is not a person who conceals himself by being vague, but in fact, there is indeed vagueness. Briand also announced to Yoshizawa that when the discussion of the Administrative Council had not yet been infected with political bacteria, the Japanese government had undertaken to carry out the withdrawal of troops that had already begun as soon as possible on the condition that the safety of the Japanese people was fully guaranteed. This declaration already contained the recognition that the safety of the Japanese people could be guaranteed. The resolution of this issue is a matter of the dignity of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Briand went on to mention Article 10 of the League of Nations Charter and Article 11 of the Paris Convention, saying that these articles are very clear. He thought that Japan knew its obligations well, but public opinion could not accept military occupation before direct negotiations. Briand also mentioned the news read in the Administrative Council's repeated meetings, saying that he did not want to introduce external debates and news. He was afraid that the Japanese government intended to introduce outstanding issues into the discussion, but Yoshizawa had declared to the Administrative Council that these issues would only be discussed after the withdrawal of troops. Japan's eagerness for the safety of its people is very natural, but he knew that if there was no military pressure, the situation could return to normal. The League of Nations has already made a great contribution to humanity in this regard.</p>
<p>Briand then proposed that Japan's counter-proposal should be discussed. If it was rejected, then unless China and Japan proposed another method, the Administrative Council's proposal should be considered.</p>
<p>Madariaga said that the basic principles that had been discussed had not been defined. He felt that it was difficult to find a country today that had a greater sense of honor than Japan, but he was very disappointed with Japan's attitude.</p>
<p>Then Yoshizawa explained in very unclear terms, saying that the Japanese government believed that the basic principles should not be raised on the seats of the Administrative Council, but should only be discussed by both sides. It is absolutely necessary to negotiate and list an agreement containing these principles in advance. Therefore, I cannot withdraw the basic principle numbers in the counter-proposal, and I cannot accept the Administrative Council's resolution without guaranteeing the safety of Japanese residents. Japan does not want to resolve the Manchurian case by force.</p>
<p>Madariaga proposed that Japan should withdraw its counter-proposal and the Administrative Council's resolution should be amended to give Japan a more certain security guarantee in the form of a solemn declaration to the Administrative Council by both parties. Briand then turned to Yoshizawa and said in a most sincere tone that no words with unclear meanings could be inserted into the resolution. The Administrative Council then announced a postponement until 5 p.m. Today's meeting has aroused great anger here. The general public is also frightened by the prolonged stalemate.

<h3 id="e9">Japan Resents Britain <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Cabinet Held a Special Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan is now quite resentful of Britain because of the Manchurian case. It is reported that the League of Nations' strong attitude towards Japan is partly due to the British Ambassador to China, Lampson, and the British Foreign Secretary, Reading. The Asahi Shimbun and other newspapers carried news of the talks between the British and Japanese ambassadors in Ningxia on October 17, saying that Lampson had instructions to advise Japan to withdraw from the occupied areas before negotiations. Lampson also said that the Japanese military authorities should allow Zhang Xueliang to return to Shenyang. Although officials here have not spoken about this news, they are quite angry. Many Japanese newspapers have published editorials criticizing Britain's anti-Japanese conspiracy, saying that Britain wants to befriend China in order to restore its lost position, so it forced the League of Nations to invite the United States to participate in the Geneva Conference in order to put pressure on Japan. Britain actually abandoned its old friendship with Japan and stood on the side of China, focusing its strength to force Japan to withdraw its troops. It should be known that Britain itself is now stationing troops in Shanghai to protect the lives and property of British people. It is unforgivable that it does not understand Japan's position. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The cabinet held a special meeting this morning to consider the League of Nations' proposals on the Manchurian case, such as the Japanese military withdrawing by November 16. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese officials seem to believe that if the League of Nations refuses to deal with the issue of the sanctity of treaties, it should not try to force Japan to change its position. Japan must insist on the binding of China's recognition of the treaty as an indispensable condition, but the League of Nations does not care about it. Officials are disappointed and regretful. There is also talk of considering withdrawing from the League of Nations. It is heard that the reason why the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond, decided not to submit the first plan that Japan could accept to the Administrative Council was because after final consideration, he felt that it was impossible to make China agree to recognize all the binding conditions. Therefore, he decided to put forward the third plan. At the same time, the Secretary-General informally suggested to Yoshizawa that Japan could ask the Hague Court to handle this issue, but the Japanese believed that if the League of Nations was unwilling to deal with fundamental issues such as the sanctity of treaties, then the entire foundation of the League of Nations would be shaken.

<p>(Nanjing) The Special Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 11 a.m. on the 24th to discuss the draft resolution of the League of Nations. As a result, it was decided to accept it and further promote the League of Nations to force Japan to fulfill its obligations on schedule, so that the Japanese would no longer have any objections.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the draft resolution of the League of Nations Council on the Sino-Japanese issue, the government telegraphed Shi Zhaoji on the 23rd, instructing him to express acceptance in order to show that our country has always respected the public opinion of the League of Nations.

<p>The Main Reason for Japan's Insistence</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources, the former Chinese Foreign Minister Wang insisted during the Sino-Japanese negotiations on consular jurisdiction that Japan must return the South Manchurian Railway and the Liaodong Leased Territory, including Lushun and Dalian, to China before China could agree that the Japanese had the right to live in the interior of China. Japan was therefore panicked. This is one of the main reasons for insisting that China should recognize the binding of various treaties. (24th Reuters Telegram) (Tokyo) The Japanese government, because Yoshizawa obviously misunderstood the previous instructions, has instructed Yoshizawa to explain to the League of Nations Administrative Council that Japan included the 1915 treaty (referring to the Twenty-One Demands) in the "existing treaty binding" that China must recognize. It also ordered Yoshizawa to ask the Administrative Council</p>

<p>to record the five key points of Japan. When Cecil raised questions about the meaning of the basic points stated in Japan's statement at the Administrative Council meeting, Yoshizawa did not list them one by one. The Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond, seemed to have told Yoshizawa that he was hesitant not to ask China to recognize the 1915 treaty because if the demand for recognition was a prerequisite, the resolution of the troop withdrawal issue would be prolonged. Drummond also suggested to Yoshizawa that Japan should be satisfied with China's recognition of the treaty of mutual recognition, so that it could abandon the 1915 treaty, which China insisted was signed under oppression and had never recognized. However, the Japanese representative stood firm, saying that other powers had recognized the validity of the 1915 treaty, so the abolition of this article was not a problem. According to Japan's view, the sanctity of treaties and the guarantee of peace are both the foundation of the League of Nations' existence. Therefore, if the League of Nations follows China's request based on the latter principle, the League of Nations should also accept Japan's request based on the former principle.

<p>(Paris) The situation in which China accepted the Administrative Yuan's resolution without reservation, while Japan insisted on its original attitude and put forward a genuine counter-proposal, has been given considerable attention by the press. Shi's remarks and his political views have been implicitly revealed in the praises of various newspapers when reporting on the meeting. Yoshizawa's failure to answer Sir Cecil's accurate and tight questions has also been noted by various newspapers. General opinion Briand's restrictive interpretation of Japan's so-called basic principles in the resolution that Yoshizawa will eventually agree that at least a part of Japan's counter-proposal will be incorporated into yesterday's resolution does not seem impossible. If so, it would not be difficult to reach a final agreement at the final meeting held this morning. (24th Havas Agency Telegram)</p>

Along the way, there were 12 regiments of Heilongjiang troops, including artillery, cavalry, and infantry, and two regiments of Tunkun troops stationed, with solid defenses. The two brigades of Xu's troops under Zhang HaiPeng's command have gone to the Xing'an area for reorganization.

The Nenjiang Railway Bridge was slightly damaged some time ago due to the invasion of Tao and Zhang, preventing their advance north. We should regard this move as a considerable military action. However, yesterday we received a note from the Japanese consulate, using the excuse that the Tao'ang Road was built with Japanese capital and intends to send workers from the South Manchurian Railway Company to repair it. Upon investigation, this action by the Japanese side is clearly using the excuse of repairing the bridge to cover up Tao and Zhang's invasion north, and it is even more inappropriate for the South Manchurian Railway Company, which is irrelevant, to send workers to build and repair the Tao'ang Road. In addition to having replied that the Nenjiang Railway Bridge should be repaired by our side, we also ask that this be widely disseminated internationally to clarify the truth.

Inns in the third and fourth districts are searched. Several people have been killed. The searches are all conducted at 3 or 4 a.m., without allowing people to put on clothes. They are made to kneel naked in the courtyard. Any delay results in either death or beating. Any money found is immediately confiscated. Shops are forced to open their doors. Financial flow is disrupted. Newspapers from both domestic and international ports are prohibited from distribution.

This anti-Japanese movement of our people is purely provoked by your country's aggression and cannot be instigated by anyone, nor can it be stopped by our government. It must be understood that the greater the pressure, the greater the resistance. The people of our country are full of boiling blood and are sworn enemies with your country's policy of aggression.

<p>(Nanjing) Among Japanese goods imported into China, the three northeastern provinces rank first, Shanghai ranks second, Tianjin ranks third, and Hankou ranks fourth. The annual sales of Japanese goods in Guangdong, Fujian, Xiamen, Qingdao, Taizhou, and other places also amount to several million to tens of millions. The majority of Japanese industry and commerce depend on Chinese money for expansion, and the country's economy largely depends on the prosperity of industry and commerce for maintenance. If China continues to boycott Japanese goods for more than a year, even if Japan is fierce, it will have no bullets to use against us. This is the consensus of those who understand the economic situation of Japan. According to a recent customs investigation, in the two weeks from the 18th of last month to the beginning of this month, imports to Shanghai decreased by two-thirds compared to the previous month, and the same is true for other ports. In the South China area, goods from the United States and Britain are actively operating in the market. Because Japanese goods are being boycotted, importers have turned to the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and other countries to order substitutes. According to international business observations, the Japanese have already fallen into extreme failure, and the development of the Chinese market will be led by the United Kingdom in the first place and the United States in the second.

<h3 id="e61">US-France Conference Begins <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Seeking to Promote the Recovery of the World Economy</p>
<p>French Newspapers Express Doubt and Fear About German-Russian Cooperation</p>
<p>Washington, 23rd (KMT) The widely anticipated U.S.-France conference was held at the White House this evening. The main figures are U.S. President Hoover and French Prime Minister Laval. The matters discussed at this conference have not yet been announced. At the beginning of the meeting, in addition to Hoover and Laval, there were U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Mills and French economic expert Pichon. Later, Senator Borah, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined temporarily. Borah told people afterwards that he had a very deep impression of Laval after the meeting, and Laval praised Borah and wanted to have a deeper discussion again, so it has now been decided that Laval and Borah will meet at Stimson's private residence on Saturday afternoon. In short, Borah's temporary invitation to the White House to participate in the U.S.-France conference has attracted outside attention. The U.S.-France meeting this evening lasted for several hours, but the content of the talks is rarely known to the outside world. Later, Laval actually stayed at the White House, sleeping in the walnut bed that Lincoln used to sleep in.</p>
<p>Washington, 24th (Reuters) Regarding the official statement on French Prime Minister Laval's visit to the United States, it has now been issued, stating that the French Prime Minister's talks with President Hoover only concerned the policies that the two governments could develop to promote the recovery of the world economy.</p>
<p>Washington, 24th (Reuters) French journalists who reported on French Prime Minister Laval's actions in the United States met with Senator Borah. Borah stated that the revision of the Treaty of Versailles is an imminent matter. It is now becoming increasingly clear that this treaty will eventually be revised by peaceful or forceful means. If the Allied countries cancel Germany's reparations, he can agree to cancel the Allied countries' war debts to the United States. He hopes that France will decide its own degree of disarmament, but if certain situations arising from the Treaty of Versailles continue to exist, he does not see the possibility of European disarmament.</p>
<p>Paris, 23rd (KMT) French public opinion is now focused on the U.S.-France conference. A reporter from the Paris Victory Newspaper stated that there is now an extremely anti-Soviet expression in American political circles. Washington's general politicians and officials are quite uneasy about the progress of the Soviet Union's five-year construction plan. The newspaper also stated that European countries are now accepting warnings and must quickly sever all existing relations with the Soviet Union before the issue of war debt and reparation reduction can be hoped to be approved by the U.S. Congress, that is, the prospect of extending President Hoover's debt repayment plan also depends on this move. In addition to the Victory Newspaper, other newspapers also reported that the Russian issue will occupy a very important position in the current U.S.-France talks. The Paris Morning Post stated that Germany is seeking economic assistance from France on the one hand, and on the other hand, it allows the Soviet Union to purchase goods on credit in Germany, with Germany's national guarantee. The United States is extremely dissatisfied with this matter. It is heard that President Hoover, Secretary of State Stimson, and Secretary of the Treasury Mellon have all unanimously expressed that if Germany cannot sever all relations with the Soviet Union, the United States strongly disapproves of German-French cooperation, because the Soviet Union's purchase of all kinds of machinery and supplies in Germany on credit is to promote the five-year construction plan and cause a great harm to the world's industry and commerce.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Another Car Robbery on the Beining Railway <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Bandits Well-Equipped and Organized</p>
<p>Passengers Fortunately Uninjured, Losses Huge</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The section of the Beining Railway outside the customs has been open to traffic for nearly a month. In the past month, it has been bombed by Japanese planes and strafed by machine guns, and plundered by bandits no less than a dozen times. The magnitude of the losses and the depth of the suffering are unspeakable. This is all due to the Japanese army's violent occupation of Liaoning and Jilin and their collaboration with bandits, resulting in the devastation of the local area and creating an atmosphere of unease. Today (the 22nd) at 0:59 AM, the 106th train on the Beining Railway was completely robbed when it arrived at Baimiaozi Station. I inquired with the Railway Bureau and obtained the following details: About 20 minutes before the robbery, about 400 to 500 bandits, armed with submachine guns and rifles, rushed into the stationmaster's office at Baimiaozi Station. They first cut the long-distance telephone and telegraph lines, and then tried to smash the track signal bell. After Stationmaster Dong's repeated negotiations, the track signal was not destroyed. The bandits then monitored the stationmaster and workers and began to rob. More than 300 yuan of the station's funds and the stationmaster's private funds were robbed, and the stationmaster's clothes were also stolen. The homes of other employees and workers were also robbed. The bandits then went to the police station at the station to rob and pointed their guns at the stationmaster, forcing him to open the door. The police station had no choice but to hand over their weapons. The bandits knew that the 106th train would depart from Xingcheng at 0:40 AM and arrive at Baimiaozi Station. They forced the workers from the engineering department to remove a section of the track at the west entrance of the station and remove the red light sign. At 0:59 AM, when the train arrived at the entrance of Baimiaozi Station, locomotive No. 313 derailed at the damaged track. The bandits opened fire on the train, and the guards returned fire. However, they were outnumbered, and their weapons were confiscated. Then, the bandits rushed onto the train, drove the passengers off, and robbed all the passengers' luggage, clothes, and the luggage in the luggage car, leaving nothing untouched. This lasted for more than an hour and a half. At about 2:00 AM, the bandits gathered at the station, called roll, and fled to the northwest. The bandits were well-equipped and organized, and it seemed that there were Japanese and Korean ruffians among them. After the incident, the station urgently telegraphed Zhang Jianxu's troops of the 12th Brigade for assistance. They did not arrive until dawn, and the bandits had long fled. It is said that no passengers were injured, but the train conductor, Cai Qingliang, was injured in the waist, and the car guard, Wei Yinzhong, also suffered minor injuries. The exact amount of the loss is still under investigation. (22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e65">Settlement of the Case of the Japanese Steamer Causing Trouble in Hankou <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Side Admits Liability and Compensates for Losses</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: On the evening of the 18th, the steamer of the Japanese warship Hirado, which was docked in Hankou, overturned a private boat belonging to Wang Chugan, which was docked at the Sixth Wharf. The goods in the boat and the cargo escorts all fell into the water. The Japanese Vice-Consul visited Ye Peng, the Chief of Staff of the Garrison Headquarters, on the evening of the incident, requesting mediation and settlement to avoid escalating the negotiations. Ye believed that this matter was related to local security, but because he did not know the truth, he could not handle it rashly. He agreed to investigate first and ordered Jin Jutang, the Chief of the Staff Office, and Ren Benzhao, the Chief of the Investigation Office, to be responsible for the investigation. If it only involved local security and did not reach the level of formal negotiations, it could be handled accordingly to avoid escalation. Jin and Ren, the two Chiefs, went to the scene of the incident late at night to investigate the situation of the boat collision and questioned the boatman and cargo escort. According to the cargo escort, there were a total of three people escorting the cargo on the boat, plus the boatman, a total of four people. After the boat was overturned, only three people were rescued. The remaining one person, surnamed Gao, named Heshang, was not rescued. As for the sunken goods, there were more than 20 bags of soybeans, one bag of "爪子" (unknown product), plus the sunken boat, totaling about 300 yuan in losses. According to the boatman, another boat was also salvaging when the steamer was rescuing people. It was unknown whether Gao Heshang had been rescued. Jin and Ren, the two Chiefs, asked what Gao Heshang's occupation was. It was said that he was a waiter at the Ning-Shao Wharf. They then dispatched two investigators to the Ning-Shao Wharf to inquire. Before long, the dispatched investigators found Gao Heshang. Jin and others believed that since the person had been completely rescued, the case would be easier to resolve. They reported the investigation situation to Chief of Staff Ye. After Ye gave instructions, he still ordered them to negotiate with the Japanese Consul. After Jin and Ren received the order, they negotiated with the Japanese Consul and the captain of the Hirado face to face. The Japanese captain shirked responsibility and hoped to avoid compensation. After Jin and others refuted him, he had no excuses. Seeing that the Japanese side had yielded, Jin then proposed a method of compensating for the losses. In the end, it was agreed to compensate for the losses with 300 yuan, and the victims agreed to close the case. Jin also verbally warned the Japanese side that in the future, steamers must be more careful when sailing on the river to avoid similar incidents from happening again. On the 19th, the Japanese Vice-Consul went to the police station again and personally handed over the 300 yuan for compensation, which was transferred to the victims for collection and the case was closed.

<p>The water patrol team in disguise captures the bandit leader. Cheng Delong, the captain of the water patrol squadron stationed in Guangfu Township, learned that Liu Zhengfu, the bandit leader in the Zhang Xushan kidnapping case in Xishan West Village, was hiding in Guangfu Town and demanding 20,000 yuan from Zhang's family. Therefore, on the 23rd, he secretly sent Patrol Captain Cai in disguise to go to the address and arrest Liu Zhengfu, who confessed to contacting twice but denied being the bandit leader. A farmer's family in Zhouzhuang Township was robbed. At about 9:00 PM on the 23rd, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came to the home of farmer Lü Fulai in Xidu Township South Village, Zhouzhuang Township, Suzhou, and carried out a search and robbery, resulting in heavy losses. A farmer's boat parked at the door was also robbed by the bandits.</p>
<p>The Department of Finance sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the license tax dispute. The oil, wine, sauce, candle, and tobacco industries in Suzhou jointly accused Chen Henian, the Director of the Wu Kunjiang Tai Tobacco and Wine License Tax Bureau, of illegally collecting excessive amounts and engaging in deception and corruption. They requested a thorough investigation from the Suzhou Department of Finance and the Ministry of Finance to maintain commercial operations. The Department of Finance specially sent Inspector Zhu Fujun to Suzhou yesterday (the 24th) to investigate. After arriving in Suzhou, Zhu visited Shi Yunqing, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and inquired in detail about the situation. He also investigated everything with the Tax Bureau to report and review.</p>

<p>The private slaughter of plowing cattle resulted in death. Jin Wanxing Slaughterhouse outside the East Gate of this county, near the railway under Miaogang Bridge, was in charge of slaughtering cattle. Because the transportation and slaughter of cattle were prohibited, the slaughterhouse did not dare to slaughter them openly during the day. At more than 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, a group of Mao Da slaughtered a cow. Because of the secret slaughter, the procedures were inevitably improper, and the owner was hit in the chest by the cow's horn, resulting in serious injuries and death. The owner, because of the private slaughter of plowing cattle, had violated the prohibition and committed a murder. He was greatly frightened and thought of a way to create a false impression, falsely claiming that he died from electric shock. He bribed the family of the deceased to hastily put the body in a coffin and did not report it to the Procuratorate of the County Court for an autopsy.</p>
<p>The silk factory has fallen into despair. Of the more than 40 silk factories in this county, due to the decline in the silk market and inability to maintain operations, only six-tenths are currently operating. Now the sales market is even more stagnant. Each dan of silk loses more than 400 taels. The silk factories have fallen into an unrecoverable situation. Most factories have prepared to temporarily suspend work in order to preserve their strength. After the Taifu Silk Factory went bankrupt and dissolved, the financial sector was greatly shaken. Those who temporarily suspended work include Yulun Dafeng Yisheng Yifeng Changyi Housheng and other factories. The rest are also preparing to suspend work. Tens of thousands of employees are in a state of panic.</p>

<p>The Provincial Party Department resolves the issue of traitors in Wujin. After the case of traitors in Wujin destroying the Party Department newspaper office and the anti-Japanese association occurred, the Provincial Party Department sent people to thoroughly investigate. The County Party Department and other groups reported by telegram. In the face of national crisis, all compatriots are indignant and unanimously opposed to Japan. Now, Guo Junfu and Hu Ruilin, inferior merchants in Wujin, dared to destroy the national salvation movement, gather crowds to destroy the Party Department newspaper office and the anti-Japanese national salvation groups, and beat Party affairs workers. It is extremely absurd and reactionary. Li Zonggang, the Director of the Public Security Bureau of the county, as the person in charge of the security of the county, did not know how to prevent this atrocity beforehand and came back to protect it afterwards. If he is not severely punished, how can law and order be maintained? The following methods were specifically proposed by the Executive Committee for resolution: (1) The Provincial Government should be informed to order the County Government to arrest the instigators Guo Junfu, Yu Yiqin, Hu Ruilin, Zhu Yuanpei, and all the murderers within a time limit and bring them to justice. (2) The Chamber of Commerce should be seriously warned. The Chairman, Guo Junfu, should be removed from his position. The Ge Qiu Silk and Cloth Industry Association should be dissolved. Hu Ruilin's shops, which have been sealed, should not be opened before the legal issues are resolved. (3) The Provincial Government should be informed to remove and severely punish Li Zonggang, the Director of the Public Security Bureau of the county. (4) The anti-Japanese association should be responsible together with the Chamber of Commerce for sealing up all the Japanese goods originally stored in the shops. (5) The two comrades Wu Wenbi and Lu Zao, who were beaten, should be properly treated by the County Party Department and await legal resolution. Articles 1, 2, and 3 of the above resolutions have been submitted to the Provincial Government for investigation and handling yesterday.</p>

<p>The County Executive Committee pays attention to the Hua Cheng Japanese yarn case. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association held its first standing committee meeting on the 22nd to discuss the Chamber of Commerce's letter and inquiry about the Kaiping coal mine's plan to change its management and transport the coal from Japan to Cheng in order to maintain industry. It was resolved that the Chamber of Commerce should be informed that during this tense period of anti-Japanese activity, it would be inconvenient to load coal on Japanese ships for shipment to Cheng to avoid misunderstandings. The period for displaying enemy goods in each store should be extended to the 28th and all should be sealed up. The Chamber of Commerce should be notified to order the merchants to comply. If this is not done after the deadline, they will be confiscated once discovered. The request from the silk and cloth industry to withdraw the order to seal up enemy goods was not approved. In addition, regarding the Hua Cheng Japanese yarn, it is widely rumored that someone is secretly contacting a sale for 4,000 yuan. During this week's Premier Memorial Week, Wang Bingchu, an executive committee member from one district, reported that he had summoned the parties involved, Chen Zhongda, Wang Bingchu, Tang Kesheng, Zhu Fei, and Chen Hongmo, for talks yesterday afternoon, with Ren Hongxin speaking separately.</p>

<p>Chongming and Qidong should continue to be separated. Chongming and Qidong were originally one county. After the revolutionary army settled in the southeast, they began to be separated. It has been five years since then. Recently, Wang Qingmu and others from Chongming submitted petitions to the Provincial Government and various departments requesting that they be merged due to the various problems caused by the separation of Chongming and Qidong. The 439th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee was handed over to the three departments of Civil Affairs, Construction, and Finance for review. The Finance Department convened a meeting. It was heard that the result of the review was that the crux of this case was that 70 to 80 percent of the industrial owners in Qidong were from Chongming. On the surface, Qidong people bear too much burden, but in fact, it is all the pain of Chongming people. Moreover, the land price before the separation was 30 to 40 yuan per mu, but now it is less than 10 yuan, while the taxes are now heavier than before, more than doubled. It is really unbearable for Chongming people to ignore this for a long time. This is the painful reason why Chongming people repeatedly seek merger. However, in this time of internal and external troubles, the people's hearts are fluctuating. If there are sudden changes in the two counties, there may be inappropriateness. Therefore, it is advocated to continue the separation and first seek to resolve these difficult problems. It is proposed to ask the Provincial Government to dispatch capable officials to the two counties to find out the suffering of the people in order to seek relief. In the future, the two county magistrates will be convened to discuss and resolve the matter.</p>

<p>Organizing a national goods cooperative. Since the incident in the eastern province, Wang Shaoping, Fang Shoumin, Zhang Zizhong, Lu Yangwu, Feng Baozhi, and others in the county have stated that it is difficult to maintain economic severance with Japan through repeated tragic incidents. Therefore, they organized a national goods consumer cooperative for the people to promote national goods in order to achieve the goal of permanently resisting Japanese goods. County Magistrate Chen Nanxuan and Zhang Chengzhong from the Yangzhou Cooperative Guidance Institute of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines have joined the initiation and are actively carrying out the work.</p>

<p>The child robbery and murder case is adjudicated. Eight-year-old Zi Baoxing, a farmer in Sandun Township, Hangxian County, was studying in a nearby elementary school when he was called back to school by Jiang Wenqing, the sixteen-year-old son of a neighbor surnamed Jiang. On the way, he snatched his earrings and ran away. Zi chased and shouted, and accidentally fell into a pond and drowned. When his family came, it was too late to save him. Jiang Wenqing was arrested and brought to the Hangzhou Local Court for examination and asked. The teacher proved that Wenqing did call him. The interrogator believed that there was a premeditation and prosecuted him for murder. The case has been concluded. The sentence was pronounced at 3:00 PM on the 24th. Jiang Wenqing was sentenced to twelve years of fixed-term imprisonment for premeditated murder.</p>

<p>A fire at the New New World. The New New World Theater on Huachang Street is a well-known entertainment venue here. The theater uses electric lights for evening performances. However, because it owed too much electricity bill, it was cut off by the Yaohuai Electric Light Factory. The theater had no choice but to ask someone to negotiate with the Electric Light Factory to supply electricity on the one hand, and temporarily switch to Tongchang Car Company's kerosene lanterns as a temporary remedy on the other hand. At 6:20 PM last night (the 22nd), before the performance started, a gasoline lamp on the upstairs backstage exploded because the worker pumped too much air into it. The fire broke out suddenly and spread to the curtains, causing a prairie fire. The fire brigade of the Public Security Bureau, the fire brigade of the transferred union, and the commercial fire brigade arrived one after another after hearing the alarm and put out the fire separately. However, because the fire took advantage of the wind, it spread to the thatched houses of the poor in the nearby Tiedao Lane and burned until after 8:00 PM, demolishing all the thatched houses nearby. The fire gradually died down, and the New New World, which had been in operation for many years, was completely destroyed. After the incident, an investigation revealed that the New New World had burned down 24 buildings and 77 thatched houses in the vicinity, affecting 59 households, with losses of about 20,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, I read an article in your newspaper's Hangzhou Correspondence column, which stated that Changxing Coal Mine Bureau was robbed by bandits and the Director was killed. It mentioned that the cause of the incident was that the Director was usually very harsh to the workers and would reprimand and dismiss them for slight dissatisfaction, which caused the workers to harbor deep resentment. After investigation, since Director Zhu came to the mine three years ago, he has been promoted from Chief Engineer to Director. He has always treated the miners well and has been gentle and kind. Yesterday he was suddenly killed, and all the employees of the mine were almost unable to cry. I think your newspaper's rumors are untrue, and I dare to ask you to correct them to comfort the public. Sincerely submitted by all the workers of Changxing Coal Mine Bureau, October 23rd.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Returned Students from Japan Held a General Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Resolved to Request the Ministry of Education to Postpone Registration</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Counselor Zhu Did Not Accept</p>
<p>The delegation of the Chinese Students Association in Japan, and the Returned Students Association in Japan, held a general meeting at the Ping'an Hostel yesterday morning at nine o'clock. More than sixty people attended to discuss various important matters and resolved as follows: (1) Registration Issue: The Ministry of Education had issued a notice to returned students requiring them to register with the Municipal Education Bureau. In principle, this could be complied with, but the Students' Association had not yet received orders from the General Association in Japan, and the registration of returned students with the Students' Association was not yet complete. Therefore, the Education Bureau was requested to postpone registration. (2) Livelihood Issue: The Ministry of Education must provide a practical solution to the accommodation problem of returned students. Because before the work of resisting Japan and saving the nation is resolved, all students are willing to sacrifice their studies and engage in the anti-Japanese movement. After registration, the Ministry of Education should not disperse students to various schools, so as to carry out the task of resisting Japan and saving the nation. (3) If the Ministry of Education can allow the above two articles, the Students' Association will immediately start general registration. At 2:00 PM, the Association sent representatives Zhao Pingzhang and five others to the Municipal Education Bureau to meet Counselor Zhu, a representative sent by the Ministry of Education, and Inspector Lin, to request the implementation of the two items resolved by the Association. However, Counselor Zhu did not accept them, so the registration issue is temporarily difficult to proceed and must be resolved after the general meeting.</p>

<p>The Chongde Girls' School Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association invited Dr. Wu Jiangleng, a Bachelor of Laws and Doctor of Medicine, to the school yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to give a speech. The topic was "The Spirit that Should Be in Anti-Japanese National Salvation." Dr. Wu said that students should have the determination to save the country by studying and immerse themselves in their studies, and determine that wiping out humiliation and revenge should be the goal of anti-Japanese severance of relations. It is appropriate to cultivate the spirit of hard work, diligence, self-reliance, and unremitting efforts. Student movements should pay attention to the preparation of "strength," not just the venting of "anger."</p>

<p>| Lost to Norsenburg Two to Three |</p>
<p>| A Scene from Group A Football Match |</p>
<p>The East China Football Team played its second game since its debut yesterday, maintaining a balanced situation with the British Army Norsenburg Football Team for 85 minutes. Unfortunately, they were defeated by the enemy in the last five minutes, resulting in a score of three to two. The 8,000 spectators in the baseball field all expressed regret. This was a scene from the Group A League.</p>

<p>In the overall situation, the British army adopted a full-fledged aggressive doctrine. The activities of the five forwards were exceptionally vigorous, which was surprising, and they were worthy of being a heroic team that once shocked the world, but their shooting was inaccurate and their efforts were poor. East China held on tightly with two lines of defense. Li Ning's rescue and Zhou Xianyan's breakthrough made the British army helpless and almost created a draw. Seeing that the situation was fierce, East China adopted a strict defense policy. Norsenburg arbitrarily moved forward, leaving the interior empty. East China took advantage of this weakness, "got the ball, and flew forward at full speed." Therefore, although the ball was mostly in the East China position, coupled with the frequent mistakes of Norsenburg's two defenders, dangerous situations were seen on both sides from time to time. East China's rapid advance by taking advantage of opportunities was mostly due to the lack of distance and stability of Xi Qiaosheng on the right wing. Once they reached the goal, they could not attack, and although there were many opportunities, they were wasted. However, the team's performance should be considered top-notch.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Norsenburg Lost Color <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Fox, an excellent British referee, blew the whistle to start the game. Norsenburg got the priority of kicking off. Tu Kaiyuan intercepted the long shot, and the five forwards flew forward as soon as they saw the ball. Li Yichen lifted a foot, a few inches away, and the second fly-in, Chen Yutian was a little slow, and failed again. The momentum of East China on the field made the British army lose color. Then, they attacked one after another. Yang Ge and Madison came side by side, triumphantly. Li Ning watched the changes calmly and sent the ball directly to the front. Five horses galloping in succession. Luoshimei missed a step, Chen Yutian took the opportunity to attack fiercely, and the ball flew diagonally away. Dai's center forward kicked the door of Norsenburg, and 8,000 people cheered like thunder. The British army did not expect such a magical army.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Came and Went at Will <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>One reversal and one return, unexpected. Less than two minutes after East China broke the door, Norsenburg also broke the door. Zhou Xianyan saw that the situation was not small, jumped out to defend it, and Norsenburg center forward Wilick could not wait to kick it in, forming a tie of one to one. Norsenburg continued to attack, and the dozens of yards of territory in front of the East China gate were all the activity area of the Norsenburg army. Chen Pu once sent a long shot, but Li Yichen did not hit it. Li Ning did it again, and the forwards rushed to the door. Dai Linjing attacked with his head, and Bao Man imitated, waving his brain and hitting it backwards. Loshilan saved a corner kick, the Norsenburg army was in danger, and East China entered a better state.</p>
<h3 id="e96">The First Half Was Indistinguishable <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Tu Kaiyuan sent the ball thousands of miles, reaching the right corner. Chen Hongguang and Xi Qiaosheng advanced, Qixihuo went to save, and another corner kick was formed. Xi Qiaosheng was fortunate not to fail. Chen Hongguang broke into the chaos, and the East China team once again took the lead. Coming and going at will, the Norsenburg army came to attack again. Elpo circled and came, Chen Hongguang failed to stop it, and the ball had flown to the center forward. Falek quickly passed to the left wing Hailsheng, without relaxing, he immediately attacked. Zhou Xianyan picked it up and dropped it lightly. Accidentally, Madison had already rushed up and kicked it in. The first half ended without a win or loss.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Miserably Defeated in the Last Five Minutes <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, the Norsenburg army attacked fiercely, and Zhou Xianyan almost became the target of arrows. The atmosphere suddenly became tense. Although the viewers praised Zhou's stability and non-loss, they also saw anxiety. Each time the British army attacked, Luo Lan rushed out and dragged it away. Chen Yutian shot sharply on the left as if to enter the door, but he was happy in vain. One attack and one defense, one advance and one retreat, holding each other down. Although Norsenburg's attack was fierce, the result was nothing. The situation had become a draw, and the change came unexpectedly. In the last five minutes, the Norsenburg army was surrounding and forcing East China to arrange a strict defense in front of the door, waiting for the ball to come. Zhou Xianyan's vision was obscured, and Xeteer shot through the gap and entered. East China was defeated by three to two.</p>

<p>| Three to One Victory over Qiu Feihai |</p>
<h3 id="e99">Qiu Feihai's Amazing Performance <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>| Efforts Strived and Failed |</p>
<p>Canadian famous tennis player Mr. De Phu has not been in China for long, but his reputation has risen. He is tall and erect, with arms over his knees. His serves are rapid and powerful, and his volleying is impeccable. The only drawback is that he is prone to wild fires. Once the wild fire breaks out, it will be overturned. In this grass tennis singles competition, he defeated strong opponents. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, he played the final with our country's famous general Qiu Feihai at the French Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Qiu once defeated De Phu with three to two in the Rotary Cup competition. His skills are superb and his will is firm. The two are equally matched and are a pair of strong enemies. De Phu's victory in the first set and Qiu's defeat were expected. In the second set, Mr. Qiu's iron arm waved, and De Phu could not control it. In the third set, Mr. Qiu's efforts failed, and De Phu came from behind. In the fourth set, life and death were at stake. De Phu advanced fiercely, and Mr. Qiu's strength was exhausted. As a result, De Phu won three to one and won the championship. At the end, Mrs. McShell gave the award, shook hands with each other and dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e100">| The Number of Wins and Losses Was Expected Early On | <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Qiu lost nine out of ten in the first set. The truth in this is difficult to understand. Some say it is Mr. Qiu's accumulated habits, and others say that Mr. Qiu is familiar after being estranged. The reason seems insufficient, but the fact is indeed the case. Therefore, the general audience knew the fate of the first set early on and predicted that De Phu would win and Mr. Qiu would lose. As expected, they were all correct. However, Mr. Qiu was not in a situation of inevitable defeat. When it was four to five, a little effort might have reversed the situation. At the beginning, Mr. Qiu won the first two games, which greatly aroused the audience's excitement. De Phu dealt with it with all his strength, first forming two to two, and then adding three consecutive games, forming an advantage of five to two. Mr. Qiu drew from left and right, repeatedly hitting the enemy's key points, recovering two games, and hope arose suddenly. At four to five, De Phu won three consecutive games, and Mr. Qiu's energy declined. De Phu won the second set with six to four.</p>
<h3 id="e101">| Iron Arm Waves, Dominated the World | <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The second set was Mr. Qiu's golden age and Mr. Qiu's masterpiece. The iron arm waved, dominated the world, lured the enemy close to the net, and then split it diagonally, causing it to not be able to return. Suddenly soft and suddenly hard, or left or right, causing De Phu's wild fire to break out, and he could not recover from a defeat. Mr. Qiu won the first three games, and De Phu saw him win back one game. Mr. Qiu used his means to control the enemy's life, and won two more games. From then on, the foundation of victory was laid. Although De Phu wanted to resist, it was difficult. As a result, Mr. Qiu won six to two.</p>
<h3 id="e102">| Life and Death Were at Stake, Efforts Failed | <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The third set was a matter of life and death. Mr. Qiu's sharp energy was extremely strong. He was good at using strategies. De Phu's rapid serves and his skill in holding the net were not enough to deal with. He was invaded and lagged behind by three to five. It was a pity that Mr. Qiu was repeatedly tricked by the enemy, and his efforts failed. The overall situation was reversed, and De Phu took the upper hand again, and won the third set by seven to five. The two rested for a while and started the fourth set. De Phu knew his weaknesses, suppressed the wild fire, and acted cautiously. After each one, De Phu completed three games in one breath, with stern words and expressions. Seeing the overall situation, Mr. Qiu was in great danger, so he stood up and fought against the enemy. He won two consecutive games, his spirit came, and hope was born. At this time, the score was Mr. Qiu three and De Phu four. Unexpectedly, Mr. Qiu's strength was exhausted, and he lost one game by a net four, resulting in three to five, and then lost his hand with a net four. As a result, De Phu won the fourth set by six to three.</p>

<p>According to a telegram from Nanjing yesterday, Cai Yuanpei and Zhang Ji arrived in Beijing the day before yesterday and met with Chairman Jiang and various committees of the Central Government. They immediately telegraphed the Guangdong representatives in Shanghai, Wang Jingwei and others, saying that diplomacy is important. I hope you will come to Beijing immediately to discuss it together. Then, they received a reply telegram from Wang Sun and others, saying that the colleagues do not ignore the importance of diplomacy at all. If there is anything to be seen, they will telegraph it at any time. After receiving the telegram, Cai Zhang immediately informed Chairman Jiang and various committees of the Central Government. Cai Zhang also came in person to urge them to come. Regarding all matters, I hope that the representatives of Guangdong will come to Beijing to discuss them in person, so as to avoid the waste of letters and messengers. Also, the Nanjing Special Diplomatic Committee telegraphed Shanghai on the 23rd to Yu Youren to be forwarded to the Guangdong representatives, reporting the seven mediation methods proposed by the League of Nations. I hope that you will come as soon as possible so that you can decide how to deal with them. However, there was no reply telegram as of the afternoon of the 24th.</p>
<h3 id="e116">A Diplomatic Committee Will Be Established First <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Peace and Unification Conference has not been held yet because the representatives from Nanjing have not yet been determined, so there is no definite date for the preparatory meeting. The Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei and others, because of the urgency of diplomacy, intend to establish a diplomatic committee before the Peace Conference to deal with the urgent needs. It is also heard that Chen Youren, Wu Chaoshu, and other important diplomatic talents will be responsible for it when it is established in the future, but this layer also depends on the opinions of Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Words and Actions of the Guangdong Representatives Yesterday <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Guangdong representatives held their usual morning talks at Wang's residence on Seymour Road. At 10 o'clock, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Chen Youren and the three others went to Hu's residence on Meyer Road for talks. They left near noon and returned to their respective residences for lunch. Wang did not go out in the afternoon. Sun went to Wang's residence in the afternoon and returned at 3 o'clock. Wu Chaoshu, because Mr. Bai Yunti had arrived in Shanghai, was eager to meet with Mr. Zou Haibin, so at 3:00 PM, he had arranged to meet with Zou at Wu's residence and had dinner at Wu's residence. In the afternoon, more than a dozen people visited Hu's residence one after another, including Zhang Fakui, Lian Shenghai, Miao Bin, Chen Jintao, and Guo Taiqi. It is said that most of what they talked about was diplomatic issues.</p>

<p>Shao Lizhi Answers Questions from a Guest: (1) I came to Shanghai based on personal relationships. Although I enjoyed meeting with representatives from the Guangdong faction, I did not participate in any meetings concerning the planning of the party and the nation. However, I am certain that both sides are earnest and sincere. When discussing important issues, progress is smooth. Because both domestic and foreign troubles are pressing, no comrade of our party should allow personal opinions to cause suspicion and disagreement. Only mutual concession and trust can save the critical situation. (2) Regarding the future improvement of the party's and government's policies, in addition to Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Ji, and Chen Mingshu, the Central representatives will also include Li Shizeng and Zhang Renjie to discuss matters with the Guangdong representatives. (3) I am not yet clear about the establishment of a unified foreign affairs committee. The date for the Guangdong representatives to come to Nanjing has not yet been determined. (4) Is Chairman Chiang going to Shanghai again? It seems unnecessary to go again at this moment. All issues will be discussed by representatives from both sides, and Chiang will follow the majority opinion. The rumors that Chiang will return immediately after going, and that peace will not proceed smoothly, are not true.</p>

He also visited Sun Ke at the Sun residence on Rue Molière, and then returned to his private residence on Route Say Zoong Field to rest. In the afternoon, those who visited Cai's residence were not received.</p>

<p>Truly Noble Deeds of Practical National Salvation are Commendable</p>
<p>Donating Ten Thousand Yuan to Purchase Airplanes for War Preparation</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xu Shengli, a leader of overseas Chinese in Penang, who is currently in Shanghai, since the terrible news of the Japanese forcibly occupying the Northeast and massacring compatriots spread, the overseas Chinese in Penang have felt deeply indignant. In addition to vigorously advocating anti-Japanese national salvation work and implementing economic severance with the brutal Japanese, they also requested the National Government through the Penang Reading Society, voluntarily donating funds to purchase fighter planes for use in the future war with Japan, and first remitted a donation of 10,000 yuan through the Hefeng Bank, entrusting Mr. Xu Shengli, the chairman of the society, to personally hand it over to the Nanjing National Government. The Penang Reading Society was personally organized by Sun Yat-sen when he lived overseas in Penang, British Malaya, and the Tongmenghui was attached to it. Although the society is called the Reading Society, it is actually the overseas headquarters of the revolution. At the beginning of the Xinhai Uprising, revolutionary leaders from various overseas ports convened a meeting at the society to jointly plan the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the restoration of the Han Dynasty. Later, during the anti-Yuan campaign and the May Thirtieth Movement, members of the society spared no effort to take the lead in promoting their enthusiasm for protecting their motherland, which is a true example for the overseas Chinese community. This grand move of donating funds to purchase airplanes has been highly praised by the National Government and the public. It is reported that Mr. Xu Shengli is scheduled to enter Nanjing within the next few days to discuss everything with the National Government authorities. It is expected that the overseas Chinese in various ports will be very enthusiastic when they hear the news.</p>

<p>Am I truly not one of these who, holding the responsibility of leading politics, lacks the spirit of public service, acts like a master at home and a slave abroad, makes exclusion the main task, seeks old grievances to take revenge, only seeks to be dictatorial, and does not hesitate to let the whole country fall into paralysis? Called leadership, but only to allow individuals to amass power, empty words are like a raging fire, but in reality, nothing is accomplished? This is the root cause of chaos and weakness. Am I truly not one of these who, in a difficult situation, harbors resentment against the world and seeks a living through destruction, incites class struggle, and overturns social order? This is the root cause of chaos and weakness. Am I truly not one of these who does not engage in production and relies on others for survival, revolves around the people, and runs between generals? Alliances are formed and broken, plans are made, and right and wrong are based on self-interest, treating national affairs like a game of chess? This is the root cause of chaos and weakness. Am I truly not one of these who, holding a public office in the state, only</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>thinks about hoping for glory and solidifying his position, perfunctorily dealing with everything, and not seeking results, or indulging in literary elegance and considering inaction as the highest virtue, or gambling and indulging in debauchery, abandoning his duties? This is the root cause of chaos and weakness. Am I truly not one of these who engages in business without following the right path, or colludes with the government to obtain illegal wealth, or deceives the public and greedily seeks unjust profits, or takes advantage of danger to obtain by trickery, or divides profits and sits idly by? This is the root cause of chaos and weakness. Am I truly not one of these who does not seek truth, but flaunts his ability to view lecturing as a method of planting party members, does not diligently study and practice, but seeks to expand his influence, and regards entering school as a shortcut to participating in politics? The academic atmosphere is becoming increasingly superficial, and academic achievements are becoming increasingly scarce? This is the root cause of chaos and weakness. Am I truly not one of these who is dedicated to his profession, accumulates assets, preserves his life, supports his wife and children, and lives peacefully and keeps to himself, but ignores the chaos and does not feel responsible for national affairs? This is the root cause of chaos and weakness. Am I truly not one of these? Consider each of these things, and if I have even one of them, then I am the root cause of chaos and weakness. The coming of foreign insults is truly my fault, and there is no need to blame other compatriots. If I have even one of them, then I am the root cause of chaos and weakness. The responsibility for correcting the chaos and strengthening the country lies with me, and there is no need to blame other compatriots every day. Everyone thoroughly understands their sins, and everyone thoroughly corrects their mistakes, and then everyone can truly forgive each other, truly love and care for each other, and then the whole country will have extraordinary unity and extraordinary strength. Only then can we talk about the method of resisting the brutal Japanese. The method of resisting the brutal Japanese can be decided in one word: national mobilization. Total mobilization does not mean that everyone goes to the front line. It means that everyone should do their best in their duties with the heart of going to the front line. All my compatriots who have military talent and experience, whether new or old, party members or non-party members, in or out of office, are not allowed to refuse or evade. They should rise up together and quickly form a complete national defense from the sea, land, and air. They should have strict discipline and meticulous planning to prevent changes, control opportunities, kill enemies, and achieve results. All my compatriots who have political talent and experience, except for those who do not have national or nationalistic ideas, regardless of new or old, party members or non-party members, in or out of office, should rise up together and strive for national defense, either by jointly organizing a national defense government, or by separately implementing local autonomy, or by guiding national public opinion, or by enriching national movements, each choosing their abilities and performing their duties with utmost sincerity, to use diplomacy, to warn and inspire the people, to maintain order, to pacify the local areas, to stabilize finance, to promote production, and to prepare military supplies and armaments, so that the front has nothing lacking and the rear has nothing to worry about. All my compatriots who are engaged in production and support themselves, regardless of agriculture, industry, commerce, or other occupations, in addition to resisting Japanese goods and materials, should also strive to investigate and study diligently to find substitutes for raw materials that have always been supplied by foreign countries in our own country, and to invent and produce methods for products that have always been unable to be manufactured in our own country, and to make the technology that has always been indispensable for perfection capable of being perfected by our own people. All parties should work together to create a self-sufficient and independent economy with no dependence in the shortest possible period, and at the same time restrain waste and redouble their efforts. Luxury and unnecessary needs should be avoided. While other countries work eight hours, we should work twelve hours, so that production will increase day by day and national strength will increase day by day. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e137">Review Report on the Hou Dachun Case <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Hou Dachun case, the Anti-Japanese Association organized a review committee to review it. This review report was also resolved and published by the tenth executive committee meeting of the association. The original text is recorded as follows: "The committee members have convened meetings twice, on October 22nd and 24th, according to the instructions of the general meeting to review the case of Hou Dachun's report and Feng Yixian's accusation that he embezzled public funds. Hou Dachun, Feng Yixian, and relevant persons Wang Yongliang and Chen Ji were also invited to the venue. After examining various evidences, the results of the review were resolved as follows: (1) The temporary record book of the inspection section before July 24th (recorded by Chen Ji, director-general of the inspection section) shows that Director Hou received 500 yuan. According to Chen Ji, he knew at the time that this amount was donated by the Commercial Press. At that time, only 400 yuan was handed over by Director Hou himself, and the remaining 100 yuan was paid for the expenses of the Zhabei district. I (Chen Ji) made a note of it. I am willing to take responsibility for this point." (2) Hou Dachun's letter to the Commercial Press on July 23rd, and the payment list of the Commercial Press, and even the final reply from the Commercial Press stating that they received the amount, all specify that this 500 yuan is a fund for assisting refugees. (3) The donations for the refugee relief fund, as well as the registration income and fine income, were all collected and remitted by the members of the economic committee, and collected by the banks and money houses designated by the general meeting. However, the receipts of the banks and money houses for collecting the relief fund, and the dispatch book of the Refugee Relief Association, stated that they were sent out only on August 1st. On July 24th, the banks and money houses were not yet responsible for collecting the funds. (4) On July 24th, the use of funds by the Refugee Relief Association was not yet settled. Hou Dachun, because he was responsible for inspection, temporarily misappropriated the donations he received. (5) The funds received by the inspection section were never sufficient, and there was never a fact that more than 500 yuan of cash was accumulated. The staff in the section almost did not consider repaying the amount. (6) After the reorganization of the inspection section into the investigation department, the previous accounts should be settled, but at that time, the remaining funds in the section were only 262 yuan, 2 jiao, 3 fen, and 5 li. On September 28th, a receipt was signed, totaling 237 yuan, 7 jiao, 6 fen, and 5 li, and received from the accounting office. By August 4th, the amount of 500 yuan received from the accounting office was completely collected. According to proper procedures, the amount should be returned to the place where it should be received. However, Chen Ji, the director-general, still kept the amount with himself, claiming that it was because the investigation department had a plan to organize a special team and would keep it for misappropriation. (7) On the morning of October 20th, Hou Dachun took the deposit of 500 yuan from Chen Ji and returned it to the Commercial Press, and retrieved the receipt for the relief fund issued in Hou Dachun's name. Based on the above facts, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The refugee relief fund donated by the Commercial Press was used as office expenses for the inspection section without a resolution from the general meeting or the standing committee, nor was it reported to the general meeting or the standing committee. It was freely disposed of, which was not without the suspicion of acting beyond authority, and invited criticism. (2) The account book uses the name of Director Hou to receive the account, which clearly shows that the amount belongs to Director Hou. The record is indeed inappropriate, but who should bear the responsibility is still a matter for study. (3) The 500 yuan of refugee relief fund donated by the Commercial Press was no longer related from the time it was donated, and was transferred to the entire anti-Japanese refugee relief association. No one should dispose of it without authorization. Hou Dachun returned the amount directly to the Commercial Press, which is questionable in terms of law and reason. (4) Hou Dachun received the amount directly, and after Wang Yongliang took it, he handed it over to the inspection section. Until the time of return on October 20th, he had never put the amount into his own hands, and it seemed that he had no intention of embezzling the amount. (5) Feng Yixian is a member of this association and serves as the secretary. He did not report the case to the executive committee or the standing committee, nor did he report the situation of his report to the central government to the executive committee. He published it to the outside world as much as possible, which seemed to disregard the reputation of this association. The review opinions are as follows. How to deal with it is requested for public decision. Review Committee Members Wang Pingnan, Chu Huiseng, Li Cishan, Xie Fusheng, Chen Yafu. October 24, 1931.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Case of Japanese Thugs Shooting Chinese Police <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Consul Speaks Ambiguously</p>
<p>The City Government Requests a Reinvestigation</p>
<p>Regarding the case on the 21st of this month at 12:15 AM, in which Japanese national Nishimura, Matsumoto, and Taiwanese Huang Kuanju, among others, riding in a car on Route Doumer and East Yokohama Road, intentionally provoked City Public Safety Bureau police officer Wang Changgen and shot him, the City Government conducted a detailed investigation that evening. The next morning at 9:00 AM, a verbal protest was lodged with the Japanese Consulate, followed by a formal written protest that afternoon, making three demands: (1) Strictly punish the troublemaking Japanese nationals Nishimura and Matsumoto; (2) Swiftly restrain the Japanese residents to prevent further incidents that increase Chinese resentment; and (3) Reserve the right to further negotiations. After the protest note was delivered, the Deputy Consul Mr. Shirai from the Japanese Consulate gave a verbal reply to the City Government the day before yesterday afternoon. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Mayor Zhang yesterday to inquire about this matter. Mayor Zhang received the reporter, but since Secretary-General Yu had received Deputy Consul Shirai's response that day, Secretary-General Yu provided the reporter with a detailed account of the negotiations. He stated that Mr. Shirai's response was that the Japanese Consulate had investigated and learned that Nishimura and Matsumoto had not carried guns that day and, having been drinking, would have been unable to carry them. Therefore, the reason for the shooting of the Chinese police officer was that the officer attempted to fire his gun, and the Japanese national, struggling with him, accidentally triggered the weapon. He requested that the City Government reinvestigate. Furthermore, he claimed that when the bullet pierced the Chinese police officer's wrist, the Japanese national was also injured. His statements were contradictory. I immediately refuted this, saying that the City Government had conducted its own investigation in segments since 12:30 AM that day, completing it by 8:00 AM this morning. The factual details were extremely clear. If Nishimura and Matsumoto had not carried a handgun, how could the D'Autreuil Road precinct have found a cartridge casing from a Browning pistol afterward? The Chinese police officer carried a Mauser, so it could not possibly have been fired by him. As for saying that they would not have carried guns after drinking, that is simply absurd. If the Japanese Consulate had investigated clearly, why did it say both that the two sides were struggling and accidentally triggered the gun and that the Chinese police officer fired the gun himself, piercing his wrist and injuring the Japanese national? In law, the facts must be absolutely consistent, and there is no room for ambiguity. After this refutation, the Deputy Consul was left speechless and again requested a reinvestigation and fulfillment of the protest conditions.</p>

<h3 id="e140">City Chamber of Commerce Requests Ban on Increased National Coal Freight Rates <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Railways regarding the increased freight rates for national coal on the Jiaoji Railway, requesting a swift ban. The telegram stated: "To the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing, according to a telegram from the Shanghai Coal Industry Association, 'The Japanese aggression is universally condemned. Economic severance with Japan is the citizen's duty and a unanimous demand. Japanese coal is no exception. Southern provinces have historically consumed two-thirds of the total amount of Japanese coal. Now that sales are refused, national coal must be transported to replace it. If the transport of national coal is delayed, the southern provinces will face a coal shortage. If there is a shortage, warships, merchant ships, trains, and all factories, lights, and waterworks will cease functioning. This situation is extremely dangerous. As of October 20, Shanghai has only 300,000 tons of coal, enough for only one month. It is urgent to transport national coal to replenish the supply. However, the Jiaoji Railway's Traffic Director, a Japanese national, is seizing this opportunity to increase national coal freight rates, effective November 1. The special export rate of 2.52 yuan per ton is now increased to 2.8 yuan. Shandong mines are reportedly halting operations. This behavior is tantamount to harming our national life. Besides urgently telegraphing the central government to order a halt, we request assistance to cancel the Jiaoji Railway's coal freight increase to avoid a coal shortage, as it concerns the nation's fate. Please grant assistance.' Therefore, as economic severance with Japan is strictly enforced, national coal should be promoted. Now, it is claimed that the Jiaoji Railway's Traffic Director, due to his Japanese ties, is seizing this opportunity to increase national coal freight rates, causing Shandong coal mines to halt operations. If this is true, the impact on coal use in central and southern provinces is significant. We hereby telegraph this information to your office, requesting a swift order to stop this, in the public interest. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce bows."</p>

<p>Since May 17 of this year, the Transportation Department of the General Headquarters has chartered a total of 20 Chinese merchant steamers on the Yangtze River routes in Shanghai, lasting for half a year. Now, various steamship companies, such as China Merchants, Sanpei, Ning-Shao, and other Yangtze River passenger lines, require ships. Therefore, the General Headquarters has been requested to release the chartered ships. Approval has been granted, and the Jiangshun, Jiang'an, Jianguo, Jiangxin, Fengpu, and Xin Ningxing, among others, are returning to Shanghai from Nanjing. Chinese ships have been operating on the Yangtze River since the 21st. The General Headquarters has retained a few Jiangyu, Jiangtian, and sea-going vessels. The rest will be released continuously. Therefore, from November 1, full operations can resume, restoring the original state of Yangtze River steamers before the war.</p>

<p>During the major floods on the Yangtze River, the lighters and warehouses in Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, and Datong were submerged. At that time, the Six Companies in Shanghai notified all passengers that storage of lighter cargo was suspended and that loading was refused in Shanghai. Now that the floodwaters have receded, the situation has long been restored. The Six Companies can now load as much cargo as possible in Shanghai bound for Nanjing, Wuhu, Anhui, Xunyang, and Hankou, without restriction.</p>
<h3 id="e144">British Ships' Business is Congested <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>In the past two months, Tai-Koo and Jardine on the Yangtze River have dominated the business. (1) The floodwaters in Wuhan and other places have receded, and goods and construction materials are being loaded upstream in Shanghai. (2) Chinese steamships have not resumed operations. (3) Chinese merchants everywhere refuse to transport Japanese ships. Due to these three reasons, Tai-Koo and Jardine's export business in these two months has been unprecedented in decades. Each ship can collect over 10,000 taels in freight from Shanghai's cargo alone. On average, in the past two months, Tai-Koo and Jardine have earned at least 1.5 million taels on the Yangtze River route. Therefore, these two companies are now very serious about loading cargo and refuse to make any concessions, requiring full payment. Jardine used to send four ships per week, but now they are dispatching one ship per day.</p>

<p>This newspaper reported earlier about the leasing of Japanese ships to a certain British trading firm in Shanghai. Now, the Qing Company's Shanghai steamers are unable to operate because the Captain has resigned, and all services have been suspended. The company has eleven ships on the Yangtze River route. For the past two months, there have been no cargo or passengers. The company intended to lease them to the British, but due to popular opposition, fearing damage to their business, the British firm firmly refused. Recently, the company also received a notice from our national shipping association and dared not lease the ships. It is now heard that the Japanese merchants can only grit their teeth and resume services, fearing that the ship licenses will be revoked if they stop operations. Currently, the company is losing at least 130,000 to 140,000 yuan per month on the Yangtze River route.</p>

<p>During the major floods on the Yangtze River, the Six Companies increased freight rates to Anqing, Jiujiang, and Hankou by 10% to cover flood expenses. Now that the floodwaters have completely receded, it was agreed yesterday to abolish these flood expenses from November 1. However, at the same time, it was agreed that from November 1, export cargo from Shanghai to Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Datong, Anqing, Jiujiang, and Hankou will be subject to a 15% increase over the original prices.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Bandits Shoot Down from Above, Three Detectives Seriously Wounded <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Wu Tianbao Luckily Escapes the Law</p>
<p>Only His Wife and Concubines are Captured</p>
<p>All Three Detectives Severely Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, a robbery and capture battle occurred on Route Pettit in the French Concession, leaving three detectives seriously wounded and in critical condition. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e152">Repeated Major Cases in Hangzhou <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The notorious bandit Wu Tianbao, from Shaoxing, has repeatedly committed kidnapping and robbery in Hangzhou and elsewhere. After the case was reported, the County Public Security Bureau issued an arrest warrant. Last month, detectives from the Hangzhou County Public Security Bureau discovered that Wu was hiding in the attic on the third floor of 25 Shengping Lane on the Avenue Edward VII in the Shanghai French Concession. They immediately prepared a document and reported to the French Concession police, who dispatched detectives to assist in the arrest. Wu was out on business at the time, and only four suspects, Wang Yongfu, Zhang Yongxiang, Wu Yuntang, and Wu Dechang, were captured. Eleven bullets were seized and sent to the Second Special Court for questioning, but they were released after being found not related to the case.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Traced to Hiding in Shanghai <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Although Wu escaped the law, the Hangzhou police authorities continued to exert all efforts in the investigation. The Hangzhou County Public Security Bureau learned that Wu was hiding on the second floor of 1 Beidifang on Route Pettit in the French Concession. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the Bureau's Detective Chief Jiang Zhongyun (Zi Jinquan, 27 years old) and informants took the document directly to the French Concession police.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Bandits Shoot Down from Above <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Around 1:00 PM, the police chief ordered detective Ni Jinrong of the 114th precinct (from Jiangbei, 35 years old), detective Zhao Chunsheng of the 174th precinct, and Zhao's partner Wang Jinyu (from Jiangbei, 27 years old) to assist Detective Chief Jiang in the ambush. When they arrived at Beidifang, they found the front door of number 1 tightly closed. Asking the gatekeeper, they were told that the front door had never been opened. The detectives then rushed through the back door from the adjacent alley. Unexpectedly, the bandits upstairs had been alerted. Wu pulled out a handgun, waiting in ambush at the top of the stairs, attacking from a high vantage point.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Opening Fire in the Face <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>As the detectives reached the middle of the stairs, the bandit opened fire, striking head-on. The bullets came like linked beads. The detectives could not dodge and also drew their guns to return fire, but aiming upwards proved difficult. As a result, Detective Zhao and the informant remained guarding outside the door, fortunately unharmed, but the rest, Jiang Zhongyun, Ni Jinrong, and Detective Partner Wang Jinyu, were all seriously injured. Because the bandit's marksmanship was accurate, most of them were hit in the head.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Three People Collapsed by the Stairway <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Seeing that all the detectives were wounded and fallen, Wu took the opportunity to escape to the drying terrace and fled without a trace over the rooftops. By the time other detectives rushed in upon hearing the commotion, the three men were already lying in a heap by the stairway, bleeding profusely. Detective Zhao quickly took his gun upstairs, capturing Wu's wife, Wang (26 years old), and concubine, Yang (26 years old). He seized a loaded handgun and immediately telegraphed the police station, which dispatched a large number of detectives to surround and search, but to no avail.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Highly Secretive Movements <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The three injured men were immediately taken by car to Renji Hospital for treatment. Jiang was shot in the throat, Ni in the temple and leg, and Zhao's partner Wang Jinyu had the most severe head injuries. All were feared to be in danger of death. The detectives searched everywhere again, but the house was empty. It was heard that Wu was a subtenant and the main tenant had fled, fearing involvement. Wu had been renting the house for more than four months. There was only his wife and concubine at home. Wu and his wife smoked upstairs all day, and no one had ever seen him at night. The daily chores were done by his concubine, but his wife went out every night in a rickshaw from the alleyway, and her movements were highly secretive.</p>

<p>Excellent Treatment in Detention</p>
<p>Since being arrested in Shanghai last month and transferred to Nanjing for trial, international communist leader Noulens has had his Far Eastern redization plan and various subversive documents searched and translated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in conjunction with the Central Propaganda Department. Yesterday, rumors spread that Noulens had been sentenced to death, but this is not confirmed. Noulens is currently detained in Nanjing, provided with Western food and servants, and receives excellent treatment. He is currently being questioned, and his lawyer is defending him.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Rice Prices in the City are Falling <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Recently, rice prices in the northern and southern markets of this city have been gradually falling due to the ample supply of new japonica rice from various places, exceeding demand. Yesterday, the highest price for premium white japonica rice in the northern market was 15 yuan per dan, and another was 14.6 yuan. Regular new japonica rice was 13.5 yuan per dan, and another was 13.3 yuan. Western new japonica rice was 14.2 yuan per dan, and another was 14 yuan, a drop of about half a yuan compared to the previous two days. Compared to the middle of last month, the difference is nearly three yuan per dan. According to people in the rice industry, although the low-lying areas in various villages suffered from continuous rain, causing disaster and submerging fields, the autumn harvest was diminished, but the low-lying areas are a minority. Some areas were submerged but later the water receded and the fields were restored. Others suffered partial damage from submersion, while only a few had no harvest at all. As for the highlands that were not affected by the flood, the autumn harvest was better than in previous years. In the Pudong villages near Shanghai, the net harvest was around 3.2 to 3.3 dan per mu. In the villages of Changshu and Wuxi that were not affected by the flood, the harvest was more than 3 dan per mu. Therefore, the overall production is quite abundant. Currently, farmers in various villages do not dare to hoard and are rushing to sell, so the market price is likely to continue to fall.</p>
<h3 id="e160">More Small Parks to be Opened in the Public Concession <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council announced yesterday that the issue of increasing open spaces in the Public Concession continues to be closely monitored. Today, each district in the Concession needs to add parks, but in practice, this issue is best handled in cooperation with the municipal authorities in the city because land prices are high and there are many new buildings making it difficult to find larger open spaces for recreation purposes. If land is to be found outside the Concession, the permission and cooperation of the Shanghai Municipal Government is required. Since the opening of parks, the number of Chinese visitors has increased and the existing parks are not sufficient. There is an increasing demand for more, but there are no suitable gaps in the Concession. The only option is to add small parks outside the Concession, where land prices are cheaper, to provide recreational space for children. The Public Works Department Chief has suggested that the homes of every citizen should be within half a mile of a large park of 20 to 40 mu for children's recreation.</p>
<h3 id="e161">News of Relief for Flood Victims <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Sources of Overseas Donations The National Government Flood Relief Committee has received relief funds amounting to 5,037,764.09 yuan and 147,139.76 taels of silver as of October 20. Of these, 1,513,160.24 yuan and 78,699.47 taels of silver were sent from abroad, accounting for slightly more than one-third of the total. (In addition, overseas Chinese in Burma and the Straits Settlements donated 4,000 bags of rice, worth about 43,000 taels of silver.) Apart from the large donations from the American Red Cross, etc., almost all of them were remitted by overseas Chinese organizations and relief associations. The donations from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia were particularly enthusiastic. The sources of overseas donations are analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>United States 471,470.41 yuan</p>
<p>Japan and Korea 324,405.22 yuan, 12,658.19 taels</p>
<p>Philippines 259,707.57 yuan, 20,295.60 taels</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies 162,744.84 yuan, 23,133.18 taels</p>
<p>Straits Settlements and 169,584.85 yuan, 2,762.50 taels</p>
<p>Federated Malay States</p>
<p>Siam 94,554.16 yuan</p>
<p>South Africa 17,103.03 yuan, 4,350.00 taels</p>
<p>Cuba 9,400.00 yuan</p>
<p>Burma 1,000.00 yuan, 15,500.00 taels</p>
<p>France 220.05 yuan</p>
<p>Canada 175.00 yuan</p>
<p>Australia 2,795.10 yuan</p>
<p>Total overseas donations 1,513,160.24 yuan, 78,699.47 taels</p>
<p>Total domestic donations 3,524,603.85 yuan, 68,440.29 taels</p>
<p>Total relief funds 5,037,764.09 yuan, 147,139.76 taels</p>
<p>The names of the individuals and organizations that donated from abroad are not known, but a large part was remitted by local Chinese consulates, Chinese chambers of commerce, and student groups. It is reasonable to assume that the donations from overseas Chinese were the most considerable, and many benevolent foreigners also donated to local relief organizations for remittance. Furthermore, the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Flood Relief Association also received a large number of donations from overseas Chinese, which is commendable. It is now heard that the American Church has raised a considerable amount. However, large-scale and organized disaster relief efforts are being jointly planned by the China Famine Relief Fund, the North American Christian Association, and the North American Christian Missionary Conference, hoping to begin fundraising in December after the American unemployment relief fund is raised.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Relief Funds Received Yesterday <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>

<h3 id="e163">Red Cross Disaster Relief News <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The details of the Wuhu Relief Team dispatched by the Shanghai Chinese Red Cross, carrying medicines and biscuits from the Times and Bazaar relief station, have been previously reported. We have now received a report from the team members Ji Heqin, Bao Kang, and Shen Jintao that after arriving in Wuhu on the 19th, they were welcomed at a meeting by various organizations. Since then, the disaster relief work has been quite busy. The disaster is most severe in the Shenshan area of the northern countryside. Along the way, passing Yuanze Bridge, Xianxinwei, Waiyang Village, Xiawuji, Hengtangpu, Zhujia Village, and Gaojiazhuang, the water has receded slightly, but the villages are in ruins. The flooded area spans tens of miles, a vast expanse of water. Mules, livestock, fields, and crops are all submerged. As far as the eye can see, there is no trace of human life. In the midst of the rising cold wind, the scene is particularly bleak. In Taishan, disaster victims are crowded together, waiting to be fed. The biscuits they brought will be distributed at half a pound per bag, with a ticket, and can be given to over 40,000 people, but there are still many people. It is like a drop in the ocean, of no help. The Gaochun biscuits released have been taken away by Director Wu Yushu, and 106 boxes must be sent to Dangtu. It is planned to be distributed personally, depending on the time and traffic.</p>
<h3 id="e164">News from the Suzhou Flood Relief Association <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>"Yangzhou is Actively Conducting Disaster Relief Efforts" The association recently received a telegram from its Yangzhou office, stating that the disaster relief process in Yangzhou begins with setting up shelters to accommodate and care for the displaced. Then, relief goods are distributed for emergency assistance. Subsequently, multiple porridge kitchens are established in key areas to provide regular meals for nearby victims. The distribution of wheat seeds and the maintenance of farm cattle are also being carried out in sequence. Personnel have been dispatched to Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, Taixing, and Dongtai counties, as well as Tangtou, Fancha, and Shaobo towns, to transport large quantities of cotton clothing and bedding donated from Suzhou. The Jiangdu area is extensive and severely affected, and a survey of households is underway to plan winter relief efforts. These are the major relief measures. Additionally, small businesses inside and outside the city that have been slightly flooded have suffered unemployment rates of 80-90%. The original loan office, limited by insufficient funds, has now been supplemented with 1,000 yuan to expand the loan amount under the interest-free loan principle. The Gongdao Bridge in the ninth district was destroyed by the flood, and the villagers cannot afford to repair it. 2,500 yuan has been allocated for repairs to provide work-for-relief opportunities. The funds for the latter two items will be drawn from the Suzhou-raised relief funds.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Pacific Science Congress, Day Four <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>In the afternoon, delegates from various countries went to Hangzhou.</p>
<p>China's population suffers from density imbalance.</p>
<p>Exploiting natural resources can regulate it.</p>
<p>The Shen Shi Telegraph Agency reports that the Pacific International Science Congress held its fourth day of meetings yesterday. A round table meeting began at 9:10 a.m., continuing discussions on "China's Economic Development Issues." Due to the break on Saturday afternoon and the departure of committee members for Hangzhou, the content of the discussions could not be published. From 11:10 a.m. to 12:10 p.m., a summary was made of the opinions on China's economic development that had been discussed over the past few days. At 12:10 p.m., a joint meeting of the agenda committee and the chairman's secretary was held. At 12:30 p.m., the Chinese delegation hosted a banquet for all committee members. In the afternoon, delegates from various countries departed from the North Station to Hangzhou on a special express train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway at 2:10 p.m. The translation of Mr. Rockhill's speech on "China's Population Problem" from the previous evening is as follows. Mr. Rockhill stated that the population problem of China is a riddle. Opinions vary, so statements also differ. Some estimate China's population at 450 million, while others believe it to be less than 300 million. It is thought that the Chinese government should have an accurate survey. It is probably no more than 400 million, accounting for a quarter of the world's population. This saying has been around for a long time, so foreigners once made a joke: "When people ask how many children a family has, if there are four, they always say three, because the fourth is Chinese." The problem is not overpopulation, but imbalanced density. According to Italian statistics from 1928, there are 348.9 people per square mile. In Denmark in 1925, there were 207 people per square mile. In France in 1926, there were 191 people per square mile. According to a recent survey in Japan, there were 407 people per square mile. In China, according to a 1929 survey, Jiangsu has 813.1 people per square mile, Hebei 583, Zhejiang 554, Anhui 389, Henan 376, Hubei 359, Jiangxi 283, Shanxi 164, etc. Mongolia averages only three people per square mile. The uneven distribution of population density is evident. Furthermore, China has not yet been able to utilize its natural resources. For example, the grasslands of Mongolia can accommodate 450,000 people, and mountain areas outside the plains can be used for animal husbandry, forestry, and planting. Adapting to local conditions and developing accordingly, wherever human economic conditions can be exploited, can solve the current problem of population regulation. At the same time, solving the population problem requires facilitating transportation, promoting education, revitalizing agriculture, and researching the utilization of natural resources in border and mountain areas, which are the most urgent tasks at present. In addition to the research and discussion of general scholars, it is ultimately said that China can simultaneously control fertility, improve the family system, and improve public security, which are crucial to solving China's population problem.</p>

<p>Thieves only stole seventy yuan</p>
<p>Jin Guitao was shot and robbed</p>
<p>Jin Guitao, a 45-year-old man from Shaoxing, residing at No. xx, Changren Lane, Baoxing Road, Zhabei, is a fishmonger. Yesterday afternoon at 5:10 p.m., he was carrying paper money totaling 1,070 yuan, sealed in two packages, one for 1,000 yuan and one for only 70 yuan, to pay the bill at the Chen Deji fish shop on Caisheng Street in the French Concession. Not far from his destination, five or six thugs suddenly appeared, brandishing handguns, threatening and intimidating him. As a result, they only managed to snatch one paper package containing 70 yuan from his pocket. The thugs then fled with their loot. Guitao, upon seeing this, immediately followed behind, shouting for help to stop the robbers. This was seen by one of the thugs, who, fearing that the police would arrive upon hearing the shouts, fired a shot, hitting Jin in the thigh, causing him to bleed profusely. By the time the patrol arrived, the robbers had gone far away, and they could only transport the injured man to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Fire in Changan Road, Zhabei <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:25 p.m., a barber shop named Changan Barber Shop, located at No. 381 Changan Road, Zhabei, run by Mao Quankun from Yangzhou, suddenly caught fire. In an instant, flames burst through the roof, and the fire spread rapidly, engulfing the neighboring Dakang Sheng Hotel at No. 385 and the storefronts at Nos. 379, 377, 375, and 373, including a hardware store, a sesame cake shop, and the overpass buildings at No. 387 Qiu'an Lane, destroying a total of seven shops and houses. The fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene and worked hard to extinguish the fire. After about an hour, the fire gradually subsided. The owner of the barber shop fled the scene immediately. A tenant, Qiu Pengshi, was detained by the Japanese police officer of the Second Station of the Fourth District for questioning. It is said that they had only moved in a few days ago and that the fire started in the main room of the barber shop. When the fire broke out, the Second Station of the Fourth District was nearby, and they quickly moved the guns to another location. Chief He led the entire squad of police chiefs to the scene to maintain order. Later, it was discovered that the shop had fire insurance, raising suspicions of arson. It is reported that an old man from Qingjiang, Qiu Jungui, 61 years old (living in the kitchen of the shop, the husband of the detained Pengshi), had his beard and eyebrows burned off by the fire, but fortunately, he was rescued by the police, otherwise he would have been buried in the fire.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Butcher's Wife-Killing Case Opens <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Sentencing to be announced at a later date</p>
<p>Qin Shoufan (also known as A Si), a butcher from Haimen who worked as a pig slaughterer at No. 55 Yuezhou Road, took his wife, Zhang (32 years old), to his brother's house at No. 3248 Zhoujiazui Road at 11:30 a.m. on the 19th of this month. He accused her of having an affair and demanded the return of 30 yuan of travel expenses, but she refused. Angered by the argument, he stabbed her in the leg and abdomen with a sharp blade, killing her. The prosecutor of the First Special District Court went to Fielun Road for an autopsy. Qin was arrested by Chinese detective Yan Qingxi and Western detective McLoughlin of the Harbin Police Station. The details of his interrogation at the autopsy site have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over the third criminal court to hear the case. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the police station, stated the case and said that no other evidence had been found during the postponement. He then submitted the autopsy report and the sharp blade for investigation. When questioned, the defendant confessed that Zhang had come to Shanghai from his hometown on the 11th of this month, and on the 13th, he gave her 30 yuan to return home quickly. On the 18th, he received a letter from his father from his hometown saying that she had not returned home. He was very surprised and found out that she had an affair with a Fan at No. 50 Jiaxing Road. So, that morning, he secretly went to Fan's place and found her, but Fan was not at home. He then took her to his brother's house to reason with her. On the way, she said that her lover had already squandered the money and that if he wanted money, he could sell her for two yuan a time. When they arrived at his brother's house, he tried to search her for money, but she grabbed a sharp knife from the side and stabbed him. He disarmed her and, in a fit of rage, stabbed her three times in the leg, but only to scare her into repenting, not intentionally to kill her. At that time, he was confused and did not know where he was stabbing her. He then went outside and told his brother to send her to the hospital. Soon after, his nephew came and informed him that she had died. He intended to surrender to the police station but was arrested by Chinese and Western detectives on Zhaofeng Road. According to his brother, Qin Shoulian, the sharp knife submitted as evidence was indeed from his home. His sister-in-law, Zhu, testified that she was in the bedroom at the time and heard a noise. When she went out to look, Zhang had already been stabbed and fell to the ground. She did not know who had stabbed her first. Western detective McLoughlin stated that the deceased had knife wounds on both her left and right legs, which were stabbed by the tip of the knife, and the knife wound on her lower abdomen was quite severe, penetrating through. The wound on the back was larger. This was witnessed by another Western detective named Hunter, who told him.

<h3 id="e179">Two Organizations Jointly Certify Domestic Goods <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Baoxing Factory Asks for Instructions</p>
<p>Shanghai Baoxing Mineral Powder Factory sent a letter to the Joint Association of Machine-Made Domestic Goods Factories, stating: "We respectfully inform you that since the Wanbaoshan incident, public outrage has been aroused, and domestic organizations are being formed to achieve the goal of economic severance. Your association, with its enthusiasm and insight, has taken the lead in organizing a domestic goods certification group, publishing advertisements for certification to provide identification. In promoting domestic goods and resisting enemy goods, it has been well received. Our factory admires this and has applied for certification of our completely domestic gemstone trademark pencils, etc. In recent days, the violent Japanese have forcibly occupied the Northeast, and their aggression is even more serious. Various organizations are conducting inspections and sealing off goods with extraordinary rigor in order to thoroughly resist them. This shows that the hearts of the people are not dead. However, reading the newspaper reports on October 17th, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a notice on domestic goods certification, with attached application rules, and on October 20th, the seventh clause of the resolution of the Committee for Economic Severance Against Japan, stating that goods with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's domestic goods certificate should be released. Although the organizations are different, the purpose is to facilitate all sectors, recognize domestic goods, and avoid misunderstandings, which is the same as your association's purpose. However, our factory has some doubts. If a domestic good has already been certified by your association, but the procedures are not yet complete at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, can it be exempt from difficulties in sales across the country? If a misunderstanding occurs, does your association have any corresponding guarantees? This matter is of great importance to the future of domestic goods and your association's reputation. Should you contact the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Anti-Japanese Association in advance to avoid unexpected twists and turns for domestic goods factories? We believe that high-minded people must have considered this and have a satisfactory solution. Our factory, attached to the end, dares not remain silent. What is the actual situation? We hope you will announce your instructions, and we are looking forward to it."</p>

<h3 id="e193">How to Effectively Boycott Japanese Goods, Lin Yifang <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>(1) Everyone should start with themselves, carefully examining whether the things they need for clothing, food, housing, and transportation are Japanese goods. Everyone should adhere to the principle of using domestic goods. (2) Managers of businesses nationwide should pay special attention when procuring goods, ensuring that they are indeed domestic goods before purchasing them. This can prevent ordinary people without knowledge from mistakenly buying Japanese goods. (3) Customs inspectors should conduct thorough investigations to prevent smuggling by unscrupulous merchants. The highest tax rates should be imposed on imported Japanese goods, so that they will voluntarily cease importing them even before the boycott is fully implemented. (This clause, which prohibits arbitrary increases or decreases in tax rates for goods from various countries, is not feasible. - Editor's Note) (4) The government should order police officers in all areas to pay special attention to searching for Japanese goods as a long-term responsibility. (Boycotting Japanese goods is a matter for the people, and cannot be handled by the government. This clause is not feasible. - Editor's Note) (5) When seeing friends buying or selling Japanese goods, they should be kindly advised to understand Japan's ambitions and voluntarily refrain from buying and selling them. (6) Merchants nationwide must not take advantage of the boycott of Japanese goods as an opportunity to profit, or even pass off inferior goods as domestic goods and raise prices to deceive people. If such behavior occurs, the most severe methods should be used for punishment. The above are a few of my temporary thoughts. I hope that all compatriots nationwide can have self-respect and seriously implement the boycott, so that the ultimate goal can be achieved amidst the boycott.</p>

<p>Voice of Anti-Japanese Resistance</p>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>The Northeast was originally our country's territory. However, the Japanese, repeatedly claiming to protect Manchurian and Mongolian interests, sent troops to the Northeast, not hesitating to disrupt East Asian peace and trample upon the Kellogg-Briand Pact, calling it a self-defense action. Yet our Northeastern authorities, who had the responsibility to defend the territory, allowed the enemy to carve it up, adhering to the so-called policy of non-resistance and seeking justice from the League of Nations. However, for months, the so-called mediation by the League of Nations has become nothing but an illusion. From this, it can be seen that one cannot rely on others for everything; one must rely on one's own efforts. Now that the country is in danger and the ferocity of the Japanese is growing daily, if we are unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation, we must unite to resist Japan. The so-called League of Nations is like a reflection in the mirror or the moon in the water, of no help in the matter. The dream should be awakened. Do not be so foolish.</p>

<h3 id="e196">The Death of Edison (Part 1) <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The American inventor Thomas Edison died at home this month on the 18th at the old age of 84. To live is a great matter; to die is also a great matter. To die as he did can be considered a death without regret.</p>
<p>From 1869, when his first invention was announced, to 1910, his inventions, large and small, totaled 1,328. During this period, he averaged one invention every eleven days. After 1910, with more assistants, his inventive career became even smoother, leaving others far behind.</p>
<p>Among these inventions, the most influential are undoubtedly the electric light, the streetcar, the motion picture camera, the phonograph, and the sound film. Although the telephone was invented by Bell, it could not have been widely used without Edison's invention of the carbon microphone. Even in scientifically backward China, few people in the cities are not affected by Edison's influence. When we turn on the electric light, ride the streetcar, watch a movie, or listen to the phonograph, we should remember this old man's contribution to humanity.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Anecdotes About Edison, the King of Invention <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Weisheng</p>
<p>Edison, the eccentric genius of the electrical world, started out as a newsboy. He neither received higher education nor studied under famous teachers. However, with his extraordinary understanding and tireless learning, he achieved great success and became one of the most prominent figures in the world. Americans even revered him as the King of Invention. He passed away at his home at 3:24 AM on October 18th of this year, and the world was shocked and mourned. Throughout his life, he emphasized experimentation in his studies. This can be seen from the fact that he began setting up a laboratory in the basement of his home at the age of twelve. Although he also enjoyed reading, his readings were mostly in the natural sciences. He lived to the age of eighty-four. In the spring of the year before his death, he still prayed to heaven, wishing to live another five years to complete his unfinished work, as he was experimenting with extracting rubber from the essence of sage. Edison had many unusual characteristics throughout his life, some of which are worth recording as follows:</p>
<p>He dropped out of school very early, and his grades in school were always below average. He liked to smoke and chew tobacco.</p>
<p>He never paid attention to the grooming of his appearance.</p>
<p>He was repeatedly dismissed from various jobs.</p>
<p>He never paid attention to his private property.</p>
<p>He often conducted chemical experiments that endangered the lives of many people.</p>
<p>He strongly opposed the idea of sleeping eight hours a day.</p>
<p>He liked to smoke strong black cigars and strictly forbade his subordinates from smoking paper cigarettes.</p>
<p>His knowledge of common commercial affairs was extremely shallow. At the age of twenty-eight, he still did not know how to cash a check. When someone told him how to cash it, he cashed the check for 40,000 gold dollars for the invention rights of the stock ticker, taking ten-dollar and five-dollar bills, and guarded it all night, not knowing that he should deposit this large sum in the bank.</p>
<p>He did not care about registering to protect his invention rights, so the amount of losses in this area was enormous.</p>
<p>He did not like to buy new clothes. He always wore clothes that were tattered and worn, but he did not easily change them.</p>
<p>When going out in the evening, he always wore silk clothes and liked to use a square-foot-sized Indian silk handkerchief.</p>
<p>When reading a newspaper, he could read three lines at a glance, and he already understood the news in his heart.</p>
<p>He liked humor and always made himself the object of his humorous writing. For example, "When I was in diapers, I lived on milk and didn't like it. Now I'm back to my milk life. It's ridiculous." "I have been engaged in two kinds of work throughout my life. Most people also engage in two kinds of work, and one of them is playing cards."</p>
<p>He believed that the greatest benefit of his invention of the incandescent light bulb was that it could help people sleep less. He believed that excessive food and excessive sleep were the two major bad habits of mankind.</p>
<p>Edison's daily sleep of only four hours had become a common topic of conversation. However, his friend Fiston admitted that Edison did not often doze off during the day.</p>

<h3 id="e199">In Memory of Qiu Xue'an Public Sacrifice to Lyricists <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Attached to the Qiu Xue'an Temple in Hangzhou is a shrine to lyricists from the two Zhe provinces throughout the ages. Every late autumn, the reed flowers bloom in full bloom, pure white like snow. The autumn wind rustles, and the reed flowers sway with the wind, resembling white waves. The literati of the two Zhe provinces hold a public sacrifice on a selected date after the Frost's Descent solar term, and feast and drink while appreciating the reeds. When the public sacrifice was held in the eighteenth year, Choucheng happened to be in Wulin and participated. Recently, I received a letter from a friend in Hangzhou, saying that the reeds were already flying like snow, inviting me to appreciate them together. Due to numerous matters, I was unable to find time to leave. Therefore, I recorded the sights and sounds from when I participated in the public sacrifice to the lyricists the year before, to record my spiritual journey.</p>
<p>Travelers from other provinces to Hangzhou only know to visit West Lake, and do not know to visit Xixi. This is because West Lake is located on the sunny side of the mountains of Qiantangmen West and Fahua Qinting, and is known to all because it has been praised by people in poems. Xixi is located on the shady side of the mountains, stretching for more than thirty miles, no more than a foot wide in narrow places, and no more than a few fathoms wide in wide places. Sandy islands are winding, and one cannot see the end at a glance. The area is planted with reeds, rushes, and reeds. In late autumn, one can row a small boat with close friends and travel along the stream. Everything is white and glistening, pressing low against the back of the awning. This scene is far better than West Lake. There is a Qiu Xue'an Temple here, originally named Dasheng. The Xianchun Lin'an Zhi states that there is a Dasheng sentence in the depths of the rushes, referring to this temple. In the early years of Chunxi in the Song Dynasty, it was the Jingbie courtyard of Zen Master Zishou. It was named after the monk's name. Later, Chen Meigong extracted the meaning of the Tang poem "Autumn Snow Covers a Fishing Boat" and changed the name to the current name. It had long been destroyed. In the year of Wuwu, Wu Cheng Zhou Qingyun traveled here and was moved, and raised money to rebuild it. He also attached a shrine to the lyricists of the two Zhe provinces throughout the ages. In the autumn of Renxu, Kang Nanhai traveled here and joined Xia Dinghou and others in writing linked verses after drinking. They were immediately carved on a stone tablet and embedded in the wall. The text reads: "The reed flowers rustle, filling the continent. The flowers fly to swallow the Yunmeng Lake. One gains a clear tour outside the mountains and lakes. Autumn ages the Xixi sky and water colors. There is a boat trip with Nanhai's seat. I have the honor of accompanying the staff and shoes to appreciate the autumn snow." The plaque with the four characters "Spirit of the Thatched Cottage" hangs high in the shrine. The spirit tablets of the lyricists of the two Zhe provinces throughout the ages are enshrined in the middle. The spirit tablets of the four types of lyricists - officials traveling, exiles, outsiders, and women in boudoirs - are attached on the sides. The couplets hanging on the walls were written by Zhu Xiaozang. The text reads: "Coming and going day and night, this place should have lyricist immortals, embracing plain clouds and yellow cranes." "The reed flowers share the same color, and the lonely guest sings sad verses again, facing thousands of ravines and cliffs." There is a Finger-Snapping Tower in the temple. From the tower, one can see the distant mountains with their deep and beautiful forests standing facing each other. Looking down, one sees the</p>
<h3 id="e200">A Chronology of Japanese Aggression Against China and Various Massacres (Part 1) <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Moyi</p>
<p>It has been more than a month since Japan forcibly occupied the Eastern Provinces. Our country is still embracing non-resistance and maintaining a calm policy, waiting for the League of Nations to resolve the situation. However, the League of Nations has held two meetings, and its trend seems to have succumbed to Japanese violence. The effectiveness of the League of Nations that our country imagined is actually equal to zero. Currently, both the Ning and Yue factions will hold a peace conference in Shanghai, hoping that there will be some improvement in the foreign policy to live up to the expectations of the people and suppress the fierce flames of Japan. The following is a chronology of Japanese aggression against China and various massacres, as a final reckoning with the tyrant.</p>
<p>In the 20th year of the Wanli reign (1592), Japan dispatched 130,000 soldiers and 9,000 sailors to attack the vassal state of Korea. This was the beginning of Japanese imperialism's aggression against China.</p>
<p>In the 21st year of the Wanli reign (1593), Korea suffered from the Japanese army and begged for aid from the Ming Dynasty. The Ming court responded to the request of the Korean king and sent troops to rescue them, but they were defeated by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>In the 37th year of the Wanli reign (1609), the Japanese general Tokugawa Hidetada ordered Shimazu Iehisa to invade our Ryukyu, capturing King Sho Nei and subjugating Ryukyu to the Satsuma domain, supervising its finances, and stipulating that the crown prince must visit Te'er Island every year at the age of fifteen.</p>
<p>During March of the 10th year of the Tongzhi reign (1874), the Japanese government appointed Lieutenant General Saigo Tsugumichi of the army as the governor of Taiwan affairs, leading the navy to forcibly occupy Taiwan, and beheading the chief Alu and his sons, among others.</p>
<p>During February of the 2nd year of the Guangxu reign (1876), Japan signed a commercial treaty with our vassal state of Korea, forcing Korea to secede from China as an autonomous country.</p>
<p>In the 5th year of the Guangxu reign (1879), the Japanese government sent Minister of the Imperial Household Ito Hirobumi and Minister of Agriculture Saigo Tsugumichi to our country to discuss the Korean treaty. Our Qing court sent Li Hongzhang as the national minister, and Wu Dazheng as his deputy. They opened discussions in Tianjin. At that time, Li Hongzhang and others did not understand diplomacy and signed a treaty with Japan with three clauses, actually recognizing Korea as a country under joint Chinese and Japanese protection.</p>
<p>In the 21st year of the Guangxu reign (1895), the Donghak Party incident broke out in Korea. Japan immediately sent troops to Korea. On June 20th, the Japanese envoy Otori Keisuke led troops into the Korean palace, killing the guards and capturing King Li Hee, using the Daewongun to preside over state affairs, and exiling Min Young-joon and others to Evil Island. All Korean officials who were not pro-Japanese were killed. Our country sent troops to rescue them, but they were defeated by the Japanese army. Thereupon, Japan used force to coerce us into signing the Treaty of Shimonoseki with eleven clauses, forcing us to recognize Korea as an autonomous country, ceding Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other places, opening Shashi, Chongqing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou as trading ports, and demanding reparations of 200 million taels of silver.</p>
<p>endless, pure white reed marshes like snow. Hanging in the tower are two couplets by Xia Jingguan and Zhu Qiangcun. Xia said, "Dark leaves cry in the wind and rain, jade dust teaches the forest ponds." Zhu said, "Lyricists have souls and should know me, West Lake is good, but don't write poems." Below the tower is a bridge called Wohong, which leads to the reed marsh. Throughout the ages, there have been 1,444 lyricists from the two Zhe provinces, starting from Zhang Zhihe of Jinhua in the Tang Dynasty and ending with Liu Bingzhao of Yanghu in the Qing Dynasty. Each person has a biography published in a special book for exhibition. During the sacrifice, sacrificial offerings are displayed on the altar, and ancient music is played on both sides. Bells and drums are sounded in unison, wine is offered to welcome the gods, eulogies are read, and silk is burned, while songs of welcome and farewell are sung, including lines such as "Secluded Xixi is on one side, reed flowers fly like snow, blooming with autumn light." The ceremony is very similar to the ancient sacrifice to Confucius, and it is very solemn.</p>

<p>— Su Min, Sent from Hankou</p>
<p>China has always been known to the world as a sick man. Therefore, there are many sick men in the country. It is painful to say. This time, the Japanese invaders treat our people like nothing. Anyone with a little blood and spirit is filled with grief and indignation, vowing to fight the Japanese to the death. I once attended military school as a young man and have a slight understanding of military knowledge. However, due to a lack of promotion, I turned to the academic world and lived a cold and lonely life. In the quiet of the night, I often lament the growth of the flesh on my thighs. Seeing the national crisis at hand, I originally wanted to put down my pen and join the army to exert my strength for the country. However, due to excessive depression in recent years, I contracted hemoptysis. Despite taking medicine, it had no effect. My lung qi is declining daily, and my body is weak and powerless. Although I want to follow in the footsteps of Ban Chao, what can I do when the disease is trapping me and my strength is not enough? The other day, I wrote to my friend Wang Zizhong in Shanghai, discussing the state of the country and mentioning my illness, regretting that I could not join the volunteer army. Wang Zi and I have always been close friends. He immediately sent me a package of magic medicine, saying it was Yijin Cao produced by Peisheng Pharmaceutical Company, which can radically cure pulmonary tuberculosis and hemoptysis. I can give it a try. If I can recover from my chronic illness one day, I can still take up arms and go to the front to serve my country. I was overjoyed to receive the medicine and immediately tried it. The cough stopped indeed. After ten days, my physical strength gradually recovered. I realized that if I could not turn weakness into strength, this body would still be useful. If something happened to the country one day, I would definitely join the army and fulfill my lifelong ambition. I would destroy this enemy with every meal. The day is approaching. I was so happy that I couldn't sleep for a while, so I took up my pen to write this down.</p>

<p>"Isn't that the certain army commander who implemented the breaking of cauldrons and sinking of boats?" He pointed at a young military officer dancing in the Palace of Confusion, muttering to himself.</p>
<p>"This army commander, because of foreign insults pressing the border and the shame of the nation, once implemented the method of breaking cauldrons and sinking boats, bravely fighting the enemy and driving them out of the country, is someone everyone admires; why is he also dancing here?"</p>
<p>The young military officer kissed the dancing girl passionately several times, and, hand in hand, in unison, sang the "Tatta Song":</p>
<p>丨丨Tatta Song, Tatta Song; if I don't enjoy myself now, what am I waiting for?</p>
<p>Singing and dancing under the Kaoshan Hall, as stable as Mount Tai 丨 as firm as a rock 丨</p>
<p>丨丨Tatta Song, Tatta Song: if I don't enjoy myself now, what am I waiting for?</p>
<p>Kaoshan Hall is the Palace of Peace and Happiness, entertaining with clear songs 丨 embellished with wonderful dances 丨</p>
<p>丨丨Tatta Song, Tatta Song: if I don't enjoy myself now, what am I waiting for?</p>
<p>Under Kaoshan Hall, no one insults, so let's be happy 丨 let's sing and dance 丨</p>
<p>Just as he was singing the third stanza of the "Tatta Song," suddenly a gust of black wind from beyond the heavens blew in, causing pearly tears and jade laments in the dance floor, and scattering the shadows of people 丨 blowing this Kaoshan Hall, as stable as Mount Tai and as firm as a rock, shaking it a few times, almost causing it to collapse completely 丨 Tao Chi, stimulated by this unexpected shock, suddenly, in his dark mind, there came a beam of light like a searchlight 丨 In this light, he saw again the scene of himself entering the Wu'ai Nunnery and talking with the elder, and could not help but feel warned by his conscience, and lament to himself 丨</p>
<p>"Alas 丨 This is bad 丨 I have actually sunk into the vortex of modernity 丨 If I want to escape the vortex, I must strive to pull myself out: if I want to strive to pull myself out, I must shout loudly for the elder of the Wu'ai Nunnery 丨"</p>
<p>He had already made up his mind 丨 He was going to call out for the elder of the Wu'ai Nunnery 丨 But, as if in a nightmare, his heart wanted to shout for the elder of the Wu'ai Nunnery, but his mouth would not obey 丨</p>
<p>He became even more panicked 丨 If he could not shout the five characters "elder of the Wu'ai Nunnery," he would only sink forever into the vortex of modernity 丨</p>
<p>"Wu'ai..." He could only shout two characters.</p>
<p>"What Wu'ai, Wu'ai, this is the real Wu'ai (unobstructed)!" A dancing girl, holding Tao Chi's neck, said very intimately.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Gold Price Rises Six Taels <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The upward trend. Yesterday, the standard gold price suddenly rose again, showing a firm and advantageous state. However, there were more than eight taels of retrospective price adjustments in the morning and afternoon. People's sentiment turned higher, and in the end, the price was raised by six taels. The fluctuations were still stable. It seemed that the silver market's rise did not affect it. The initial opening was slightly higher, already becoming an inverse proportion. Indeed, the American silver market rose slightly, especially because there were telegraphic communications from the UK stating they would maintain gold coins. Moreover, the bills of exchange from the UK and the US turned from a deficit to a surplus. Although it was a long release, internally it was tense. The buying sentiment in the market was consistently high, and soon after it broke through 705 taels or more. However, Hengxing and others sold quite a bit, resulting in slight advances and retreats. Finally, it was at 706 or 7 taels. The market will be closed tomorrow, as it is Saturday. Recalling this week, the market situation has changed significantly. In reality, both the domestic and international situations are complex, and people's hearts are hesitant. The price was as low as 685 taels and as high as 722 taels. The total increase was about 13 taels. The winds and waves of the future will be difficult to calm down. However, the gold exchange's margin has been reduced by ten taels, and it is now thirty taels (per bar). It was already announced to all brokers yesterday.</p>
<p>Fluctuations are still stable. From the early opening, it increased by 1 tael and 5 mace to 701 taels. Large bars rebounded from 8/6 to 16/9. The silver price only increased by 1/2. Private telegrams only increased by 1/4. Therefore, it continued to rise by 1 tael and a half, to 02 taels and a half. Hengxing came to sell, and it was reduced by 3 taels, to 699 taels and 5 mace. Before long, the face was still good. Qian Changxiang, Zhifeng, Yonghengchangyong and others bought, and the bills of exchange tended to be firm. The bank traded US dollars at 32 yuan 3125, and when the opening bell rang, it was 04 taels and 5 mace, while Changsan (Shanghai) was listed at 375. US dollars only rose by 375, at this time only retreating by 1 tael, to 03 taels and a half. In an instant, buyers were like clouds. Hengyu, Tongchun, Richangyu, Dada and others came to buy, especially British gold traded at 17 and a half, and US dollars only settled at 32 yuan, so gradually it rose by more than 3 taels, nearly 10 o'clock it was 07 taels and a half. In a moment, there was a fluctuation of 1 tael or more. Hengxing, Yifeng, Yuanmao, Yong and others continued to sell, and it was immediately suppressed to 04 taels and a half. Then HSBC sold forward US dollars at 32 yuan. Afterwards, short-term zero accounts covered their positions, and Mitsui absorbed US dollars at 32 yuan, so it increased by 2 taels. However, from 10:10 to 10:30 there was a fluctuation of 1 to 2 taels. After entering, Qian Changxiang and Hengxing came out again, and it softened again. At 11 o'clock it was 04 taels and 1 mace. Suddenly Hengyu, Qian Changxiang, Shunli, Tongtaichang and others all bought, and British gold was available for sale at 174375, and it rose again. At 11:20 it was 08 taels. Unexpectedly, the bills of exchange seemed to return to flat, 174375 could be settled, and it was learned that Indian bills of exchange increased by 8 annas, a heavy decline, cutting off 3 taels 67 mace, at noon it was 04 taels 3 mace. In an instant it rose again by about two taels, until the closing was 705 taels 3 mace. Wupin and others came to buy, and it continued to rise to more than 6 taels. Compared with the previous day (according to the listing price) it increased by 5 taels and 8 mace. According to the half-day, the maximum was 08 taels, and the minimum was 99 taels and a half, a difference of 8 taels and 5 mace. Wupin opened early at 99 taels and a half, and closed at noon at 06 taels and a half. In short, people's hearts are dazed, drifting and uncertain, so it is difficult for both long and short positions to start. The revealed price was changed to more than 760 taels, a total of 60 taels before and after. The registration and replenishment of water was both 05 taels. Bare bars increased by 8 taels.</p>
<p>The transactions are inconsistent. There were many transactions on the platform. According to statistics, Zhifengyong, Qian Changxiang, Hengyu, Shunli, Tongchun, Hengchangyong, Yuantai, Cuichangyong, Yuda, and Richang all bought. Hengxing, Shengda, Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Yifengyong, Futaiheng, and Yifeng all sold. Tongtaichang, Wanxing, Senchangyong, Daxingyong, Yongfeng, Dakang, Taifengcheng, etc. had very troublesome receipts and payments. Speculator Mr. Wu bought some. The Dalian gang bought more than 800 bars in total, and sold 400 bars. The Guangdong gang sold more than 2,000 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Foreign Exchange: Loose in Appearance, Tight in Reality <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian and silver markets all reported rises. However, the market situation was hesitant, and then softened, and the exchange rate turned lower again. It was mostly that the Shanghai market exchange bills were in fact loose in appearance but tight in reality. The HSBC listing price has been lengthened by one and a half notches, with British gold at 375, at 1 shilling 7 pence 25, and US dollars only rising by 375, at 31 yuan 375, which is to smooth out small exchange rates. Hong Kong continued to drop by 25, at 77 taels 625. All other exchange rates also rose accordingly. However, the bank transaction price was flat in the morning and tight afterwards. As a result, compared with the day before yesterday, British gold shrank by 125, and US dollars shrank by 375. The gold market therefore rose by 6 taels. Chinese merchants such as the Guangdong gang settled tens of thousands of pounds of British gold, and also about 200,000 to 300,000 yuan of US dollars, which was not as prosperous as the previous day. However, the League of Nations still has no definitive news about Japan. In the afternoon, as it was Saturday, the market was closed as usual.</p>
<p>There was a difference of 25 in the internal offer of British exchange. The loosest was 1 shilling 7 pence 625, the tightest was 1 shilling 7 pence 375. The asking price in the morning was about 625, the buying price was 6875. Mitsui and HSBC traded in tandem in January at 625, and East Asia and Bank of China traded in tandem in December at 17 and a half. Shanghai entered in January at 4375. The closing offer at noon was 174375 to 375, and the buying price was 17 and a half to 4375.</p>
<p>There was a retrospective of 625 in the internal offer of US exchange. The loosest was 32 and a half yuan, the tightest was 32 yuan. The asking price in the morning was about 32 and a half yuan, the buying price was 32 yuan 625. Zhenggin and Wahbi traded in tandem in December at 32 yuan 3125, Zhenggin offered in November at 32 yuan, Zhejiang offered in January at 32 yuan 125, HSBC and Anda traded in tandem in March at 32 yuan. Mitsui also entered at the same price. The closing offer at noon was 31 yuan to 0625, the buying price was 32 yuan 125 to 1875. The listed price was about 3 taels 1 mace 8 fen 725 per yuan.</p>

<p>According to a London telegram yesterday, the large bar silver has turned back to increase, such as the near-term increasing by 625, to 17 pence 3125, the forward-term increasing by 5625, counted as 17 pence 375. There were few purchases from both mainland China and India, and transactions were scarce. At the closing, the market was dazed and uncertain. After the closing, because the transaction price was below the listing price, the market situation turned sluggish. The United States had no great development, and then received a New York telegram, the price of American silver rebounded by half a point. The spot price is 3 yuan 9 jiao 2 fen 125 with the British pound down one point against the US dollar, and the US dollar is 3 yuan 9 jiao 1 fen 25 with the pound sterling down one point 75. The London-Shanghai shilling increased by 1 penny 25, to 1 shilling 8 pence 25.

<p>Overview of the Market Yesterday's money market, the morning market was still extraordinarily tight. Until the afternoon, because there were quite a few head linings for bank drafts, the water price increased from being high to being cheap, and the bank could do the mortgage as they pleased. As a result, the households with collateral were greatly active, and the money market suddenly rebounded. Although the silver dismantling (interbank lending) did not fall very sharply, a glimmer of hope had already been realized, and it is expected to gradually loosen in the near future.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices "Foreign Interest" The morning market interest rates were contended by each other, so the closing price was unwilling to rush forward, at 7 mace 3 fen, only 1 hao 2 hu and a half lower than the previous day's afternoon market. The afternoon market suddenly fell sharply, counted as 2 li lower, at 7 mace 2 fen 8 li, because the bank sold out heavily, and the demand turned weak. "Silver dismantling" The morning market was 6 qian, 1 qian better than the previous day's high price. In the afternoon market, it was heard that the head lining was slightly abundant, so it fell by 1 qian, counted as 5 qian, the same price as the previous day. The surcharge for drafting was initially 5 qian, then greatly loosened, decreasing from 2 or 3 qian to 4 or 5 fen. The bank listed price was 2 qian 4 fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions The Jiangnan small silver dollar, the morning market was 6 qian 5 fen 7 li, the afternoon market was the same price. The transaction was only 1,500 jiao in the morning market.

The transaction was 175,000 jiao in the morning market, and 65,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Small copper coins were 1,000 wen, for 376,500,000 wen.</p>

<p>When the current long-term closing period arrives, it happens to be a time of extraordinary money price increases. Ordinary lending rates generally refuse to turn upward. However, households with solid credit and those with congested funds will inevitably continue to solicit business as usual. Therefore, yesterday in the market, it was heard that some people had made deals. It is said that on the guest gang side, the Andong gang made 2 to 3 million, with interest rates of 11 taels and 11 taels and 5 mace. On the local factory side, Fuxin, Maoxin, Shenxin and other three factories made fixed interest rates of 10 taels, six months. As for the amount, there is no definite news. It is generally up to the financial community to the extent of its capabilities, and the lending is filled out, so there is no exact number to count at present. All the lending from the Ningbo gang is currently in the list to be recovered. Although most of the closures are bound to be transferred, there is no room for accommodation at present.</p>

<p>Various bonds rebounded by about two or three yuan</p>
<p>However, the spot market price continued to fall more or less than before.</p>
<p>Although various bonds were opened in the spot market yesterday, there were few transactions. The futures market was generally good. The morning started weak, and the secondary market gradually became firm. However, the late market was more active as short accounts covered their positions, and rose rapidly in unison. For example, the recent period and the November period of demobilization and reorganization, almost rose above the large-scale suspension auction. As a result, except for the whole of the sixth month period, the unified tax in the November period, and the salt tax in the October period, which were better by one yuan and several jiao, and ninety-six, which were only slightly more than half a yuan, the others rose by 2 yuan to 3 yuan 7 or 8 jiao. The decline in late August almost reached the level of the Nian (20) yuan, and now it has suddenly soared. It is said that the total spot transactions for the whole day were 13,000 yuan, and the futures transactions were more than 13.4 million yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and rose at noon. However, the spot yarn business was extraordinarily quiet. Affected by the tight money situation, the purchasing power of various gangs was weak, so most of the psychology was to watch the fatigue. However, the bottom goods of the factories and manufacturers did not sell out, so there were still people who purchased between 58 taels.</p>
<p>People's Standard (Ren Biao) was low in the morning and high at noon. The previous market of People's Standard (Ren Biao) opened, with American cotton turning up, but the cost of capital was high, and there was a lack of buyers in the market. Each month fell by 3, 4, 5, or 6 qian. The afternoon market opened flat and tired, with the second and third rounds rising sharply. The near term rose by 8 qian, and the far term rose by 1 tael, 146 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 25,000 bales. It was found that Taixing bought 4,300 bales, Gengfeng bought 1,850 bales, and Ruidabought 1,250 bales. Gongtai bought 1,050 bales, Hengde bought 1,850 bales, and Xincheng bought 1,850 bales. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>December 160.3, up 4, 94,400. March 160.2, -10, 62,600</p>
<p>Spot transactions are not smooth. The sales of spot yarn are flat and weak. It was found that the total number of bales bought by various gangs throughout the day was only 300 bales. 115 bales were traded among peers. The market was flat and weak. Among the guest gangs, 65 bales were purchased from Jiangxi, 85 bales were purchased from Haizhou, 65 bales were purchased from the inland, 45 bales were purchased from Nanyang, and 40 bales were purchased from miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3 id="e210">The Rising Wind of the Cotton Market Revives <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>American cotton has turned firm and risen again. The rising wind is especially strong. The gold market is settled, which has made people's hearts firm, and buyers' minds are becoming more and more intense. The general scattered short positions see the environment as good and take the opportunity to cover their positions. The market trend is therefore becoming tighter and tighter. The Standard Appraisal Association discussed the standard for the release of the fire machine flower, which is about 5 qian lower. Therefore, the Han gang is very optimistic about the high. In the past, some people thought that the spot price of American cotton was 4 or 5 taels higher than before. What will happen in the future still depends on American cotton for advances and retreats.</p>
<p>The Han Standard (Han Biao) rose by 7 or 8 qian. The previous market of Han Standard (Han Biao) opened, with American cotton rising, people's hearts were good, and the buying sentiment was strong. Each rose by 3 or 4 qian. In the afternoon, scattered households resisted the short positions and rose by another 2, 3, or 4 qian. The transaction volume was 123,400 dan. It was found that Dafu sold 2,400 dan, Taixing sold 5,100 dan, Yichang sold 7,900 dan, Gongtai sold 5,700 dan, and Yiyu sold 6,000 dan. Tianlong bought 13,600 dan, Ruida bought 3,800 dan, Xincheng bought 3,000 dan, Xiesheng bought 2,000 dan, and Xinheng bought 2,000 dan. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm and stable due to excessive rainfall, short covering, and a lack of sellers. The futures price rose by 29 to 34 points, and the spot price rose by 25 points. British cotton futures rose by one point, and the spot price fell by one point. The spot price of Egyptian cotton was unchanged. Indian cotton was initially weak due to slight selling by European exporters, but then recovered due to buying by brokers. It is counted that Pingguo'er was unchanged, Aomura fell by 2 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 0.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 23rd).</p>

<p>Due to Humid Weather</p>
<p>Speculative Spot Hoarding</p>
<p>New York, Telegram of the 23rd, reporting on the cotton market during the week: At the beginning of last week, the price of cotton continued to strengthen due to the continued movement of the buying wind. Although there was a reaction afterwards, when the price fell, the industry and speculators bought in, so the situation was quite stable, and the selling in the South was also slight. The humid climate has delayed the harvest in the fields, but in the mid-month report of the ginning number, it is expected to break various records. According to private estimates, the ginning number ending on October 18 may reach 8 million to 9 million bales. It is also heard that many news say that speculators are widely buying spot goods in the Southern market in preparation for hoarding.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Grain River Down Rice Market Steps Loosen <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, each gang from Nantou came with 278 ships. Sales on this street were not good. Changxin japonica rice and Ding were tired. As for the goods from the high and middle ranks of the market, they all need to be reduced by one or two jiao. The taste for goods such as Ping Li Bei Dun is even scarcer. The city's store delivery is afraid of further loosening, and they all lack interest in importing. The decline in the varieties of Shibu, Sijing, and Tinglin and other Baige Kiln is even more severe, falling by three jiao. The new Yang Du Jian from the rural gangs has some business, and the price is according to the original board, with no broken grinding Baiyuan available on the market. Yesterday, only 34 or 5 ships from Changxi and Xianzi and other gangs arrived at the new gate. The destination of each batch of goods is still lonely. There are about 200 ships stored in the area of Shanban Factory, Xinqiao, and Xinlaji Bridge, with an average of 180 dan per ship, and the total amount stored is about 36,000 shi. The inventory in Xixin is still abundant. The two varieties of high and secondary are each 2 jiao lower. The decline in Kiln-grown white rice is especially fierce, falling by about 2 yuan compared with last week's price. There are not many new Yang Du Jian arrivals, and the situation continues to rise.</p>

<p>Futures Market Experiencing Selling Pressure from Foreign Firms</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for foreign rice saw notable activity, with inquiries from northern brokers in Tianjin and Yantai. The market atmosphere was quite favorable, with 400 bags of Xiaojiao rice changing hands at a price of $10.09, an increase of 10 cents from the previous market close. Local brokers did not participate. If northern brokers continue purchasing in the coming days, the market is expected to rise further. The futures market experienced selling pressure from foreign firms, leading to significant activity. Ningbo brokers purchased 4,000 tons of November rough Xiaojiao rice at a price of 4.75 taels per ton offered by Jardine Matheson. Gilman &amp; Co. offered 1,400 tons of April Xiaojiao rice at 5.35 taels per ton, and Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co. offered 500 tons of April No. 1 Saigon rice at 5.68 taels per ton. All were purchased by local brokers at prices higher than the previous market close.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Forward Flour Prices Surge <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed signs of near-term stability and rising prices for forward contracts. The quotation for foreign wheat rose by about 60-70 cents, stirring excitement both inside and outside the industry. The trend for foreign wheat is improving, having risen sharply from its lowest point. This phenomenon suggests a brewing turning point. If this continues, the future source of foreign wheat will naturally become a concern, and the excitement surrounding forward contracts is not without basis. As a result, prices for this month are 7.5 li higher than the previous day, November is 1.25 fen higher, December is 2.5 fen higher, January is 2.75 fen higher, February is 3 fen higher, and March is 2.75 fen higher.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Futures Wheat Following the Trend of Higher Foreign Wheat Prices <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market saw prices rise throughout the morning and afternoon. Because the quotation for foreign wheat had already risen by 60-70 cents, and most people predict that the situation for foreign wheat has turned from unfavorable to favorable, the fall of the domestic wheat market was, in reality, suppressed by foreign wheat. Now that it is gradually rising, those both inside and outside the industry are naturally following suit. The resurgence of buyers seems to be happening at just the right time. However, at the highest point in the afternoon, it was heard that Ding Tai had some spot foreign wheat to sell, and the market atmosphere immediately calmed down slightly. Otherwise, prices would inevitably have reached new peaks. As a result, prices for this month are 8 fen higher than the previous day, November is 9 fen higher, December is 8 fen higher, January and February are 6 fen higher, and March is 7 fen higher.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the raw silk market in Shanghai remained quiet. The New York market was quiet, raw silk factories remained sluggish, and there were no significant increases in purchases of Japanese silk. Silk sales in London and Lyon remained stagnant, and telegrams did not bring any changes. Yesterday, only Lian Na and other firms imported 20 bales of white silk from Jiangsu, and Da Chang and others imported 30 bales of yellow silk from Sichuan. Prices are not expected to rise.</p>

<p>Jiangbei counties have all reported droughts this year. All silk cocoon waste products are being transported by cargo owners to Nanjing for storage. Due to the receding waters, there is still cargo from Jiangbei production areas that has not been shipped out, and it is now being transported in batches. As a result, Nanjing warehouses are running out of space. Therefore, Li He and other firms are transporting the Jiangbei residue, cocoon ends, handles, cocoon head, and cocoon skin that was previously stored in various Nanjing warehouses to Shanghai by truck. Yesterday, 250 items arrived and are currently stored in the railway bureau's warehouse for collection. More than 300 bundles are expected to continue to arrive in Shanghai in the coming days.</p>

<p>Domestic Product Production Increasing Daily</p>
<p>Piece goods trading remains stagnant. Combined with the recent surge in silver exchange rates, there is little room for activity. Due to unfavorable environmental factors, more and more firms are scaling back. Yuan Fang Cloth Firm has also seen a decline in this period. However, made-to-order trading is quite active. In addition, with the exchange rate for Sterling improving step by step, a significant amount of goods are being traded to British merchants, especially woolen cloth and linen. Striped and patterned silk fabrics have gradually improved since the boycott of Japanese goods. Higher quality fabrics are being re-exported for 3 cents, likely due to a shortage of spot goods. Yuan Xie and Ning Silk are being purchased slightly. De Ji goods are selling for 3.85 cents, and Yong Xing goods for 3.75 cents. Double-width Xie Yu gauze, which was previously rarely inquired about, has now been completely swept up. The promotion of domestic goods is quite active. Production at factories is increasing daily, but sales volume is huge, and current volume is like "a drop in the bucket and of no help." Therefore, production from large-scale textile factories is necessary to meet demand. Lun Chang factory goods can now be freely transported. Northern brokers have been purchasing them in succession. Flower-patterned Zhi Gong cloth is selling for 4.1 cents, speckled Zi Gong cloth for 2.7 cents, old flower-patterned Ting cloth for 2.45 cents, and serge for 3.4 cents to 3.05 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Hardware Western Nail Trading Slightly Sluggish <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The trade in Western nails has been unusually scarce recently, and inventories are abundant. Morale is low. Those with inventory are eager to sell, leading to fierce competition. The market is very sluggish. The current market standard is estimated at 8.5 taels per keg, and sales activity is limited to the Yangtze and Fujian brokers. Other brokers are not involved. In addition, the market for small colored nails is also quite sluggish. 3-fen nails are selling for 12.75 taels, 4-fen nails for 12 taels, 5-fen nails for 11.5 taels, and 6-fen nails for 11 taels.</p>

<p>Allocation of American Troops as of October 20:</p>
<p>(1) On the French front of the Allied forces (French and British): 3 divisions in the Vosges region, 2 divisions in the French 4th Army region, 2 divisions in the Franchet d'Espèrey Army region, and 1 division scattered in various units.</p>
<p>2 divisions on the British front.</p>
<p>(2) Under the command of General Pershing:</p>
<p>14 divisions on the front lines in the Argonne and Lorraine regions, 6 divisions on the second lines, 9 divisions in the rear, and 4 newly arrived divisions.</p>
<p>A total of 43 divisions.</p>
<p>According to the table above, of the 30 divisions fighting on the front lines, 10 divisions are allocated to the Allied forces (French and British), and 20 divisions are under the command of General Pershing. These 20 divisions form the independent American forces.</p>
<p>The American forces are divided into two parts, each with a different nature. For various reasons, this allocation was made. I also plan to implement a strategy of shifting resources as the situation evolves, reducing the 20-division portion to increase the 10-division portion. In this way, the weaknesses of the American commander-in-chief can be reduced. However, no one can deny the courageous fighting of the American troops. After capturing Saint-Mihiel on September 12, the American troops attacked Argonne on September 26. From September 26 to October 20, the American troops suffered 54,158 casualties. The main reason is that the terrain in the battle area is narrow, making it difficult for large forces to maneuver, and attacking against a strong enemy is not worth the losses.</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to promote the rapid restoration of the joint offensive of the French 4th Army and the American 1st Army and to facilitate their attack, I issued a general instruction on October 21, clearly stipulating the objectives and strategies to be used by each army as follows:</p>
<p>The general objective of the American 1st Army and the right wing of the French 4th Army is for the American 1st Army to advance to the Buzancy area and for the French 4th Army to advance to Le Chesne, in order to break through the Aisne River line from the east.</p>
<p>The two armies have achieved complete contact through fighting so far. The American army was previously blocked by the forest area, but now it can take the opportunity to attack. The two armies should identify a common goal and first occupy the high ground of Argonne with a large-scale operation from the east and west. In this way, the unnecessary sacrifices in the forest war can be avoided. The successful steps are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The American 1st Army should prepare to launch a powerful attack towards Buzancy as soon as possible, using the open area north of Romagne and Romont, and avoiding engagement in the forests of Argonne and Bantheville. Only in this way can the objective be achieved.</p>
<p>(2) The French 4th Army should maintain contact with the American army at Grandpré, while using a large-scale, rapid maneuver to attack Champigneulle from Vuzier, and Le Châtelet from Vouziers, directly taking Le Chesne and striving to expand the front line. The commanders of the American army and the Central Army Group must be informed of the above instructions so that the two armies can expand the scope of operations according to the plan and meet at the designated objective. Please inform me of how the two army commanders are coordinating. My plan is for the French and American armies to conduct expanded attacks in the easy-to-maneuver areas on both sides of Argonne.</p>
<p>I then urged General Pershing to begin the offensive west of the Meuse River as soon as possible. On October 27, I wrote to him, "It is most important for the American 1st Army to prepare to launch an offensive on the scheduled date, that is, November 1, and it must continue to advance until the great victory is achieved."</p>
<p>I also stipulated that after the American 1st Army launched its offensive on November 1, it must continue to advance until it occupied Buzancy before halting.</p>
<p>The development of the French 4th Army east of Vouziers since October 13 facilitated the American operations. The French army established bridgeheads between Vandy and Falaise on the right bank of the Aisne River, containing large German forces in the Argonne region, thereby greatly reducing the pressure on the American army.</p>
<p>The American army began its offensive on November 1, and on the first day, it captured enemy positions in the Buzancy-Stonne area. On the left flank, the French 4th Army also expanded to the east of the Aisne River. I then ordered the French and American armies to take advantage of the victory and advance towards Sedan and Mézières. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e226">Yu Yang: Japan's Tanaka Cabinet's Aggressive Policy of Invading Manchuria and Mongolia <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Xin Sheng News Agency Publishing Department has translated Japan's Tanaka Cabinet's aggressive policy of invading Manchuria and Mongolia into a small booklet, which has recently been published. After reading this booklet, I was deeply alarmed and felt that every sentence and every word in this booklet had substance, and every sentence and every word could destroy China. Over the past ten days, the Japanese army has forcibly occupied important places in our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, advocated the independence of Manchuria and Mongolia, and done many lawless things, completely inheriting the mantle of the Tanaka Cabinet and implementing the plans in this booklet one by one. At this critical time when the country is in trouble and needs to know itself and its enemy, such a book must be introduced. Please see what he |Tanaka Giichi| said at the beginning of this memorial:</p>
<p>"My empire, in order to develop its resources and cultivate lasting prosperity, has specially established the South Manchuria Railway Company, investing over 444 million yuan in railways, mines, forests, steel, agriculture, animal husbandry, etc. in the area under the beautiful name of Sino-Japanese coexistence and co-prosperity. It is the most ambitious organization in our country's enterprises, and although it is nominally half-official and half-private, the government controls all the real power. The South Manchuria Railway Company is entrusted with diplomatic, police, and general political powers, so that it can exert imperialism and form a special company, no different from the second Korean Governor-General."</p>
<p>Oh, look at his ambition. He has long regarded Manchuria and Mongolia as the second Korea. He wants to seize Manchuria and Mongolia into his own hands forever, so he adopts the following measures: "Moreover, the three eastern provinces are a place of incomplete politics in East Asia. Our Japanese, in order to protect ourselves and protect others, must use iron and blood to remove the difficulties in East Asia. However, if we want to protect the three eastern provinces with the doctrine of iron and blood, the third country, America, will be incited by China to use barbarians to control barbarians to restrain us. At that time, our competition with the United States will be inevitable." "In the future, if we want to control China, we must first overthrow the power of the United States. The meaning is very similar to the Russo-Japanese War."</p>
<p>Now Japan is waging war without declaring it, forcibly occupying important places in the Northeast. Isn't this implementing his doctrine of iron and blood? That's why he uses such a swift and violent means to forcibly occupy, isn't that because he wants to prevent the third country |America| from sanctioning them? On the 29th of last month, Washington sent a telegram stating that |American newspapers have changed their tone due to the Japanese's best efforts to publicize it, and do not support the United States and the League of Nations adopting an intervention policy|, doesn't that mean that they already have a plan to deal with America? At this time, isn't he celebrating the success of his prediction that "If you want to conquer China, you must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia. If you want to conquer the world, you must first conquer China"? He said in the second section, "Manchuria and Mongolia are not Chinese territory":</p>
<p>"The so-called Manchuria and Mongolia, according to history, are not Chinese territory, nor are they special regions of China. Our Dr. Yano has worked hard to study Chinese history, and all believe that Manchuria and Mongolia are not Chinese territory. This matter has been announced to the world by the Imperial University. Because the research and publication of our Dr. Yano is correct, Chinese scholars have not opposed the theory of our Imperial University."</p>
<p>The reporter is ignorant and has not had the fortune to read Dr. Yano's theory. According to him, our Chinese scholars have not opposed this theory. If this is true, then our scholars who study history and geography cannot shirk their responsibility, and the Institute of History and Philology, which the country has spent a lot of money to establish, does not know what it is doing. Now Japan is vigorously promoting the independence of Manchuria and Mongolia based on these reasons. Tanaka Giichi's disciples and grandsons are truly surpassing their predecessors.</p>
<p>In the section "Korean Immigration Incentives and Protection Policies," there is such a statement: "According to the Koreans in Manchuria and Mongolia, if the number expands to more than 2.5 million, then in times of trouble, Korean people can be used as the basis for military operations, and their actions can be aided in the name of suppression. In addition, among the Koreans in Manchuria and Mongolia, some have naturalized as Chinese citizens, while others have not. At the time of the event, it is a strategy of 'hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat' to deal with the Korean citizens with Chinese citizenship." After reading this, the Wanbaoshan Incident can be clearly understood, and its conspiracy and trickery are enough to make people gnash their teeth with hatred. There is also a more conspiratorial scheme that will make you shocked:</p>
<p>"We must do our best to prevent the entry and exit of Red Russia. We must use the Fengtian government as a wedge to prevent its power from going south. Our first step is to use the theme of preventing Red Russia from going south to forcibly advance the territory of northern Manchuria by getting an inch and then wanting a foot to seize its resources. In the south, we can control the northward power of China, and in the north, we can control the southward power of Red Russia. If we want to compete with Red Russia politically or economically, we must drive China as a pioneer. We can only supervise China from behind to prevent the expansion of Red Russia, while we secretly cooperate with Red Russia to control the growth of China's power and prevent it from interfering with our vested interests in the South Manchuria Railway."</p>
<p>Oh, it turns out that during the previous Middle East War, Japan strictly maintained neutrality for this reason. Our country must be vigilant in the future to prevent him from succeeding in this way. Regarding the plan of "New Continent Development and the Manchuria-Mongolia Railway," he said this: "The Chinese nation has a large number of troops defending its country, which is economically disadvantageous to us. If we want to develop its resources and expand our national defense, we must vigorously build the North Manchuria Railway. With the opening of this railway, a large number of people can be moved to North Manchuria to control the politics and economy of South Manchuria and to strengthen our national defense to lay the foundation for the overall situation in East Asia. In addition, the completed lines of the South Manchuria Railway are mostly for economic purposes, resulting in a lack of loop lines, which is very unfavorable for wartime mobilization and military supply. In the future, military purposes must be the priority to build a large loop line in Manchuria and Mongolia, which can surround the center of Manchuria and Mongolia to control the military, political, and economic development of China and also prevent the intrusion of Russian forces. This is a necessary key to the creation of our country's new continent." Therefore, he wants to complete the following railways: (1) the Tongliao-Jehol Railway, (2) the Taonan-Solun Railway, (3) a section of the Changtao Railway, (4) the Jihui Railway, (5) the Hunchun-Hailin Railway. Now that they are forcibly occupying our territory, they can do whatever they want, but during the negotiations, they must at least demand the commercial rental rights of these railways. We must remember that these routes are "used for wartime mobilization and military supply," and are sufficient to "control China's military, political, and economic development." We must use strong diplomatic means and vow not to give them to them.</p>
<p>In addition, there are active conspiracies concerning (1) Manchuria-Mongolia trade doctrine, (2) building a large shipping company centered in Dalian to control East Asian maritime transportation, responding to both water and land routes, and dominating the Pacific Ocean, (3) implementing the gold standard in Manchuria, (4) welcoming third-country investment in Manchuria and Mongolia, and (5) changing the management of the South Manchuria Railway Company, as well as the seizure of steel, iron, kerosene, ammonium sulfate, and agricultural fertilizers.</p>
