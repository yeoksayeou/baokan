<p>關於遼案之一切談判</p>
<p>美仍保持自由之主張</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美總統胡佛昨在國會詳述美國與國聯努力調解遼案經過稱、美國爲非戰公約與九國公約簽字國、負有維持中國領土完整之切實責任、故在保持中日之和平上、美國與其他諸國咸有間接或直接之關係、嗣乃瀝述遼案歷史迄今之發展、及各方面維持遠東和平之努力、連中國之聲訴國聯在内、并謂因此美政府認協助國聯、俾全世界合力以保持和平、似較單獨行動爲明智而適當、但關於遼案之一切談判、美國仍保有完全自收之判斷與行動、於是撮述美國與中國及日本間往來各照會、謂美政府　再忠告兩國尊重非戰公約内之義務、說明美國對於遼案之關切、美政府深知美於中日間危局、凡欲維持和平者必須有極端之耐心、深信美國輿論當亦欽佩般倡導和平者忍耐持重之明智云云、嗣於撮述國聯理事會最近决議案第天乃報告其他問題、如决定明年出席軍縮大會、與日前法總理賴伐爾訪美執政、及决意撤回尼加拉圭境内美陸戰隊等、（十一日國民電）</p>

<p>在保持兩種條約</p>
<p>紐約　紐約世界電訊報爲史克里浦好沃德京報紙、今日社論標題爲「警告日本」内稱、日政府此時應了解美國務院之政策、一以美國輿論爲依違今美國之輿論、極注意於保持日本所曾違犯这兩條約、决不漠視非戰公約與九國公約之常級蹂躏者僅事停止敵對行動、而留日軍或日人操縱之政府統治東三省、而不能適合該兩公約之需要、倘日人鑒於美國目前之無所行動、誤信其可以蔑棄昨日向國聯所發之撤兵保證、則將鑄一大錯、倘日人不知善用某機會、行將招致全世界之抗議、迫國聯與美國立即聯合干涉云、（十一日國民社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>言論自由之眞義</h3>
<p>比日本埠各報。忽無故遭受扣發。此一事實顯爲非法。昨旣已由日報公會宣言抗議。并决定自即日起絶對不受任何檢查。絶對不受任何干涉。今請更就言論出版自由之法律與事實各方面。予以闡述。以明言論出版自由之眞諦。</p>
<p>夫所謂言論出版自由。就法律之立塲而觀之。則有其絶對之神聖爲任何人與任何勢力所不能侵犯。人爲社會的動物。生而有思。思而必表之以言。以博取社會之反應。爲使思之作用之擴大也則更進而刋其言流播於世。故爲發展個人之思想。爲啓闢知識之寳藏。爲增進人羣之福利。言論出版之自由。蓋至爲高尚。此種基本人權。人各享有。但使不濫用此種權利以危害大衆之福利。則任何人固都未嘗受有超出常人之特權。而容許加以侵犯。擰他人之唇舌而命之曰。此可言。或此不可言。束縛他人之神經中樞而命之曰。此可思。或此不可思。掩蔽他人之耳目而命之曰。此可視聽。或此不可視聽。固矣。在維護整個社會福利意義之下。吾人固不能否認社會公衆有此種特殊之强制力。但固執一種不合乎公意之觀念。就一種劃定之路綫而予以人之言行以着色之觀察。史就主觀之立塲而予以偏詖之判斷。則此種不公平之强制力。適爲人羣之障礙。抑且吾人誠不解行使此種强制力者。是否能必其所行而爲絶對止確。蓋彼亦爲常人而並非天縱之聖。假如其所行而非正確。則其本身已爲悖逆人羣之公意爲擾害社會之秩序。爲以强力取得不正當不名譽之特殊權利。人民非皆爲襁褓中之嬰兒也。即嬰兒亦自有其啼笑之自由。吚喔之自由。任何人不能强加限制。故西諺有云。「好政府非自治之代替。」吾人更可廣其意而聲言曰。「眞正之自治。必須有眞正之自由。人羣眞正之公意。亦依賴於人羣言論之眞正之自由。」</p>
<p>正以言論與出版自由關係個人與人羣如此其深切。故世界各國都視爲國民應享之基本權利。而特接受社會之公意。鄭重刋爲法律。而予以保障。去年四月二十我政府亦曾明白命令。「……凡在中華民國法權管理之内。無論個人或團體。均不得以非法行爲侵害他人身體自由及財產。違者即依法嚴懲不貸。」言論出版自由則固自由範圍中之一部分也。而今年國民會議三讀通過之約法第二章第十五條。亦明白規定「人民有發表言論及刋行著作之自由。非依法律不得制止或限制之。」如國府命令與約法所規定則已明白說明言論出版自由爲合法。而無端加以限制。即爲非法。民意即法律。今干涉自由則已非民意。法律爲保障自由。今侵犯自由。則已違背法律。故自人羣公衆之福利而觀。以及法律之見地而觀。言論出版之自由。應有其絶對之神聖。不容許無端加以侵犯。</p>
<p>更自事實上觀察而言之。一國之政治應爲一國人民公衆行動之表現。人民究何從而影響政治推進政治。則在於以其思想以其經騐以其行爲直接買諸公衆。故發表其思想本其理智之判斷。以供公衆之參考。以求增進公衆之福利。爲人類對人羣應盡之天職。爲國民之所以自效於國家。如妨礙此種天　之行使。即爲妨害人羣思想之進步。即爲妨礙人類福社之增進。</p>
<p>今之持干涉論者。不曰言論已逸出常軌乎。不曰出版將妨礙大衆乎。不曰其擾亂現時國體成破壞現時秩序乎是誠然矣。然而人類社會至今已有四五千年之歷史。人類文明。朝代各别世紀各異。歷史洪流。端以人類之需求與激盪而翻出新潮。前日之所是。即今日之所非。而今日之所非。則或亦即他日之所是。縱覽歷史。何處有常軌。又何者爲常軌。旣無常軌。則自無所謂逸出。更無所謂擾亂與破壞。自然之發展即常軌。自由之推進即常軌。若必泥守陳跡阻遏新潮。舉國民之思想言論行爲而皆加以禁錮則不僅在理論上爲不可。而在事實上亦絶不能。</p>
<p>尤有進者。人之思想與言論。其發生皆非偶然。在此社會而人民有此思想有此言論。則此社會當有產生此種思想言論之因。設如此種思想此種言論而眞能動摇國體。破壞秩序。則此國家此社會必病根已深必已先有可乘之間隙。蓋亂者非常人所願有。而竟有之。必政府先失人民之愛護也。故言論者。人心向背之索引。亦即人民公意之顯露。如其激而爲時代之潮。則澎湃奔放莫之能遏。歷來中外各代所興之文字獄。其效力究何若。往事具在。吾人今日固不妨回頭一看。</p>
<p>欲政治臻於合理之域。必須有公正之民意。即必須有負責之言論故政府惟有接納人民之公意。博採人民之言論。以爲改進之標準。斷不容緘人民之口。而制止其發言。束縛人民之神經。而制止其思想。英政治學者賴斯幾有言。　　「政府爲周諮博訪計。得力於反對者之批評。必較贊助者之誦揚爲多阻塞人民之批評。即自種滅亡之根而已。」實則必有滅亡之根。而人民乃得有所批評。若又從而予以遏抑。則更爲諱疾忌醫。結果適更爲自速其滅亡而已耳。　　故政府對於人民之一切行爲。不應以自身之立塲及利害。判斷其當否。而應就自身之缺點。而予以考慮。予以接納。使大衆爲推進自身之動力。而不應使自身爲停滯大衆之障礙。在時代浪潮之前。在大衆行動之前。任何障礙。亦絶無存在之理。遏抑限制之至極。人民即口不能言而千夫所視。千夫所指。切壓力將。安所施。此就事實之立塲而觀察。言論出版之自由旣不容無端侵犯。尤不能無端侵犯也。</p>
<p>目前我國家正値大難當前。打破國難。民缘有責。故人民固應隨時發表其意見。貢獻其思想。而政府尤應竭誠納採人民之公意。採取大衆之言論。以爲救國之方針。國府日前曾决定組織國難會議。汪精衛先生亦曾主張組設國民救國會議而昨日胡漢民先生。更主張永遠組設民衆代表機關。是則今日民意爲重。民衆之言論更爲切要。政府方採納之不暇。更何容予以遏抑自法律之見地言。旣無人能在法律之上自不容違法而侵犯他人之權利。就事實之立塲而言旣無人能遏抑悠悠之衆口。亦自不能無端而干涉他人之發言。吾人敢斷言人民自由。國乃自由。人民而遭受禁錮。消失其生命之力。國家前途殆亦極亦黯淡。而消失其生存之力。</p>

<h3>各中校生抗日聯會</h3>
<p>丨今日開緊急代表大會丨</p>
<p>上午九時在淸心中學</p>
<p>本市各中校學生抗日救國聯合會、兹經第八次臨時代表大會議决、定於今日（十三日）上午九時、在陸家浜路淸凡中學開臨時緊急代表大會、討論重要事宜、業已通函各校、推派出席代表二人、準時前往出席云、</p>
<h3>工部局務委員會决定加設華人學校</h3>
<p>（申時社）工部局之敎育計劃内　關於加添華人學校一節、在十二月二日學務委員會會議中、主席聲明、照工部局已定之計劃、每年應加設新校兩所、惟一九三一年内僅成立一校耳、當由工務處長答稱、此事之關鍵、全在尋覓相當之校址、應請學務委員確定應需校址數目、以便工務處調查設計、至本年内雖未能設立兩校、但工部局已租賃校址兩所以供需用矣、</p>
<p>於是主席乂宣讀華藉各委員來函、内稱因明年或不能加設兩處小學及一處女子中學、故彼等建議、暫行租屋、設立兩處男女合校之小學、而特建築永久校址之欵之一部、規定於一九三二年之預算内、以便在一九三二興工、一九三三年完成、主席亦稱工部局之敎育計畫、在最初數年内、必須盡力實行之、</p>
<p>某委員稱、本會計畫、新校旣有十六所之多、則各校間之距離、恐亦難甚遠、於是工務處長稱、彼意應即在西區工業區内覓一校址、但亦須視財力之如何、於是主席提議、請工務處長即行着手調查、有何處房屋可供租賃、以備一九三二年内加設華人小學兩所、此議通過、</p>
<p>某委員稱、彼對於租屋設校之暫時辦法、並不反對、但應鄭重聲明、本委員會係不得已而出此、建築永久校舍、乃極重要之事、故彼意極贊同尋覓約六處之地皮、以爲永久之小學校址、並特别注意西區、俟有調查報告、即斟酌於一九三二年預計内撥欵購買此項地皮、</p>
<p>於是財務處長言及節省經費之必要、但衆意學務處之地位與他處不同、工部局旣已决意改變其敎育方針、爲華人多設學校、若悖此方針、是失信於華藉民居也、</p>
<p>某委員乃提議一變通辦法、即於東區覓一處或數處地皮、建築臨時校舍、以避免租屋之鉅額租金、衆議如不能以合理之租價租得校舍時、則此議亦可備參考云、</p>

<h3>砭骨寒風中苦鬥曁南東華和局</h3>
<p>零與零之比</p>
<p>甲組足球賽</p>
<p>天氣驟寒　冷風砭骨、東華曁南兩足球隊、昨日仍舉行甲組寳於中華棒球場、九十分鐘劇戰、結果零與零比、各無射中、和局而終、以東華與曁南之强、初次相逢、冒寒往觀者、仍有三四千人、雖慄慄然、不稍動也、</p>
<p>東華陣綫</p>
<p>陳璞　錢敬鏞</p>
<p>李寗　陳洪光</p>
<p>周賢言　屠開元　陳家球</p>
<p>關洵安　李義臣</p>
<p>金元燦　陳虞添</p>
<p>曁南陣綫</p>
<p>梁樹棠　劉祖侃</p>
<p>丘東炎　楊保淼</p>
<p>陳部章　莊世鴻　陳鎭和</p>
<p>馮運佑　江宗綿</p>
<p>陳福忠　梅洪寳</p>
<p>將士各變耳目一新</p>
<p>雙方出戰將士、各有變更、尤以曁南爲其、傷者傷、病者病、主將江善敬羅海光、守門温鼎新、皆未出戰、甚至以前鋒要人丘東炎、改充後衛東華則負有　指揮使命之戴中鋒、亦缺席、而以陳家球升替焉</p>
<p>風中表演不勝其難</p>
<p>朔風怒號、刮面捲人、寒冷旣不敢當、遑論對風而踢、先者東華對風、球多不能出、活動改常、出球亦不能如意、精彩不可論矣、東華後衛不必論、中衛線昨日甚、新進之金、老將之陳、中將之屠、各甚滿意、前鋒之中錢敬鏞活動甚力、曁南馮運佑後方吃重、守禦四方、丘東炎亦頗不差竟　知其能攻亦能守、前鋒小黑炭爲人監視、活動遂不多見、</p>
<p>曁南上塲聲勢嚇人</p>
<p>李諾斯裁判、東華開球、曁南乘風、大舉進侵陳福忠傳梅洪寳、沿邊急進、造成角球、梅洪寳落角甚佳、楊保淼未甚蹴人、不勝可惜、開賽只二分鐘、東華得球、陳璞而錢敬鏞、亦急進、傳與陳虞添、射力甚輕、陳部章接住踼出、旣南又率師來攻、梁樹棠三十餘碼地遠射、周賢言順手踢出、同被圍攻、頭部竟受一脚、幸未大害、上半時如此告終、</p>
<p>寃哉家球並未倒戈</p>
<p>有人以東華之屢攻不進、怨及陳家球者、以陳本曁南、代替中錄、不無嫌疑、遂有呼家球倒戈者、實則冤哉、請觀事實、東華易地後、聲勢頓增、亦進行攻打、可惜二次門前二十碼之任意球、皆未射入、一次李義臣、一次馬開元、忽誌人之事發現、陳家球帶球、匹馬直衝、連劈三關、對門猛射、疾而烈、以爲進矣、然球恰中陳部章之手而撲出、家球何嘗倒戈哉、繼又苦戰二十分鐘、零比零終局、</p>

<p>我國藝苑中人。與東　著名之書畫家。向多往來酬酥　而爲彼邦所推重者。厥惟錢瘦鐵王一亭馬企周孫雪泥馬孟容諸君。王每年所賺日人畫資約萬餘金。三島人士。咸以得王之寸縑尺幅爲榮。自日軍侵佔遼吉後。王辭去日淸買辦。以示决絶。錢之鐵笨書畫。日人極珍視之。而錢賦性高傲。不肯輕許。近已拒絶日人請求。與孫雪泥馬孟容馬企周等。協助何香凝夫人救濟國難書畫展覽會。徵求畫件。奔走呼號。淚隨聲下。蓋其愛國之熱血。已達沸點已。馬孟容寫異魚圖及一蠻不如一蟹兩幀。題以長歌。慷慨激昂極諷剌倭寇之能事。見者咸爲擊破唾壼。孫雪泥向與日商往來。惟自東北變起一例禁絶日商營業往來賀天健題抗日歷一組。分贈各友。其畫圖由其高足田淸泉精繪。賀天健題句。立意措辭。均極高妙。見之可作永遠紀念。惟最妙者。募加馬企周之與日詩人田中桂南。詩詞酬唱。互寄郵筒。上月田中又寄詩於馬。馬覆以絶交書。中有句云。國仇一結。國恥勿忘。劃地絶交。請自今始。會當相見於槍林彈雨中。勿謂秦無人也。現正與馬萬里馬孟容馬公愚等發起四馬援馬書畫會。售畫以助軍餉。聞者義之。</p>

<h3>一齣歷史戲的開塲白</h3>
<p>沙翁說·「世界是一個大舞臺…」人類正在排演一齣空前的歷史劇，懶得動與高興動的人們都是劇中人。我不會寫劇本：寫幾句開塲白請一位三花臉唱一唱吧：</p>
<p>「老夫也曾革過命，</p>
<p>於今懶動怕人動。</p>
<p>誰要大膽動一動，</p>
<p>唵就斷他是反動！」</p>
<p>更正　一個敎師與家長的答復</p>
<p>（一）園丁的責任在灌溉，施肥，除害蟲而不没收幼苗的自由的空氣與自由的陽光…（丁誤作中）</p>
<p>（二）興安嶺的樹苗可有樹聽差扶着？（有誤作以）</p>
<p>（三）自由是以自己的意志指揮自己的行動。個人自由是以個人自己的意志指揮個人自己的行動。團體自由是以團體自己的意志指揮團體自己的行動。</p>
<h3>龍江風土志馬石痴</h3>
<p>友人王北溟君。蜚聲法界。尤熱心於抗日工作。救國五人團。即先生所興起也。頃者。歸自滬特區法院。驅車過訪。傾談竟夕。爲予述龍江風土。得悉其厓略。蓋先生固曾服務於黑垣者。嗟乎。班定遠之不作。戚少保之已亡。舉目河山。半淪異族。余紀斯篇。墨與淚俱。蓋不勝其黍離之感焉。</p>
<p>黑龍江。在北魏時爲北扶餘。勿吉。諸部之地。逮唐。則室韋。靺鞨。諸部興焉。滿淸入關。乃於黑龍江築城。設將軍都統以鎭守之。淸季。裁將軍。改巡撫。置府廳州縣。設省治於齊齊哈爾。（譯音）稱龍江府。入民國。政府爲縣。而仍以齊齊哈爾爲省治。</p>
<p>齊齊哈爾。地僅彈丸。雉堞相望。居東門。則西門囑焉。城市湫隘。有駱駝。騾馬車。以資交通。城以外。則沃野千里。牲畜繁盛。人民耐勞苦。習耕種。逈不若南方之奢侈柔靡也。顧其耕種之法。墨守不變。田間種子。相率自由散播。不需灌壅。及時收成。則以糟粕充食料。擇其精良。運銷海外。日常充饑。胥爲麥類。麫食雜土爲之。粗黑若炭。佐以鹽。劣苦至不能咽。而黑人視之。珍饈勿啻。甚矣。習尚之可風也。</p>
<p>黑地奇寒。八月江水冰凍。需時八個月而始解。雨水奇少。入秋。雨露都爲冰雪。騾馬踐之。遺矢雪地。冰結不解。行旅苦之。郊外凛冽。尤不可耐。有時涕淚交流。凝成冰凍。至於目難開睫。羔皮。爲黑地唯一禦寒之具。一袍僅需十數羊。顧其服式詭異。羊毛向外而内襯麤布。皮統靴。障面兜亦然。不識其用意何屬也。房屋密不透風。而無潮濕之患。入冬。居民相率扁户設火炕取煖。燃料奇缺。則以乾燥之騾馬糞充之。炕置汽管。透屋外。無惡濁氣。入其居。如黍谷之春回焉。</p>
<p>植物首夏萌芽。新秋摇落。結綠之期。爲時甚暫。七月產西瓜。須御棉而食。盛夏六月。最宜夾衣。而早夜郊行。仍不勝其寒凉也。</p>
<p>黑地氣候旣殊。而晨昏遞嬗。殆與南方成反比例。春夏兩季。晝短而夜長。入秋則反是。近際冬月。晦瞑之時。大抵須九句半也。</p>
<p>農作物出品。以大豆爲大種。次爲小麥。園蔬則生菜蘿葡數種而已。大豆一項。近年收成頗豐。然引銷内地。運費奇昂。而捐稅又重。有得不償失之苦。坐是生產過剩。竟有摧毁而作燃料者。滋爲可惜。竊願高唱提倡國產者。一思及之。</p>
<p>王君又言。東北邊省。論乾輒者「地瘠民貧。」其實民固貧矣。地何嘗瘠。苟能改良耕種。勤事畜牧。開拓礦產。整頓交通。生聚不待十年。生產足資全國。倭奴寤寐以求。巧取豪奪。必欲得而甘心者以此。如此山河。我神明黄胄得而遺於子孫。我子孫豈可畏難苟安。一朝斷送於不抵抗主義之下耶。</p>
<h3>李芳宸將軍軼事</h3>
<p>— 石磊盦</p>
<p>中央國術館長李景林將軍。爲北洋宿將。國術名家。近竟以便血逝世。噩耗傳來。海内無論識與不識。莫不同聲哀悼。尤以李之故舊僚屬。痛哭至失聲者。</p>
<p>李字芳宸。河北棗强人。現年四十有七少時家貧早孤。弱冠即岐嶷有大志。曾負笈東瀛。卒業於士官學校。回國以後。由營長迭擢顯職。張雨帥生時最企重之。屢次畀以重任。似軍長督辦總指揮等。李治軍嚴明。足與侯媲美。東北人至今稱道弗衰。</p>
<p>吾國軍人。多擁鉅資。獨李不事生產。北伐以後。絶不斷斷名利。當道知其能。將使鎭某方。李堅辭未就。乃任中央國術館長。於國術事業多所籌劃。其提倡國粹强健國民之功。不可没也。</p>
<p>李晚年耽於禪悅。殊有世外之想。某日曾謂夫人曰。余老大蹉跎。治軍多年。於或於民。愧無建樹。今兒輩俱已長成。可以自立。安得撒手紅塵。如吳子玉之逃禪方外乎。言竟悠然。其書法秀健似率更。曾見爲何嘉君作一聯曰。「櫪嘶支遁馬。池養右軍鵝」。筆力挺發。殊見英雄氣慨。　　據李幕客言。將軍生平自奉極儉。恒讀書擊劍以爲樂。且天賦獨厚。體魄强壯。近則以歷年行軍所受風濕。手足常憾痠麻。醫囑常服牛内汁可以袪病强身。李因命价至市。購可達獅牌牛肉汁數打服之。果獲奇效云。（却酬）</p>
<h3>奇魚識小錄</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>魚涵泳水中。自得其樂。佛家因有水梭花之號。其種類綦繁。供吾人庖饌者祗什之一。兹將耳所聞並目所瀏覽書册紀載之奇魚。錄之以博閱者一粲。</p>
<p>雲南有水晶魚。魚之腸胃。無不映徹。望之甚悉。</p>

<h3>故都聞見錄</h3>
<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>黄芽白</p>
<p>北方霜早寒深。宜冬季無蔬菜可食。然乃適得其反。黄芽白者。得霜愈濃。則愈甘美。一至春令。索然無味矣。所謂霜菘是也。爐火曁然。煮菜一盎。和羹食之呵以加餐。無勞更假肉味。且日日啖之不厭。故非他蔬可及。若以鹽漬缸中。鎭之以石。寒重冰凝。入口如嚙冰雪。爽脆無比。東坡所謂醉後啖鹽虀。定即指此。往時滿人於嘉平八日。雜煮珍果米粟爲飴麋。號曰臘八</p>
<p>粥。親友互相餉遺。必以此虀爲勝。云菜之美惡。可以卜家之盛衰。北都寒季皆燃煤球以取暖。貧家室小窗嚴。煤火將燼。則生毒臭。人臥不覺。中其毒則窒息而死。往時缺西藥急救之方。惟急飮以虀汁。則可甦。亦賴家家俱有此物也。近年多用西式火爐即使仍用煤球。亦多知移將燼之火於室外而後就寢。又警區多備藥物。廣爲勸告。此患漸稀矣。凡初至北都者。宜審問而愼防之也。又北都有温室。可以人工育蔬蓏。故冰雪嚴寒中。思食王瓜之屬。可以立應。特價奇昂耳。　　賣冰聲</p>
<p>舒位瓶水齋集有京師寄内詩云、丁香芍藥都開過。杏子櫻桃價漸平。金剪乍收銅盌響。賣花聲換賣冰聲。此詩寫夏令景物酷肖。蓋賣冰者以二銅盞疊擊之作聲。便捷可聽。累見明淸人筆記。其風絶古。近不獨賣冰者、凡賣甜食者亦如是也。北都藏冰多在十刹海。冬令即鑿海中之冰若巨石塊。納諸窟室。次年夏間。發而售之。無貧富皆恣用。古者藏冰頒冰之政至重。前朝仍有四月賜冰之典朱炎煩敲。賴以稍解。亦猶行古之道也。北人夏令筵席首進冰盤。以生果雜置冰盤啖之。貧人或竟齧冰代飲。易致腹疾。是宜嚴禁。</p>
<p>其音如嬰兒。食之已狂。</p>
<p>葉魚。尾歧出如樹葉。首部有紋。產菲律竇。又蚘魚。甚美麗。長數尺。蜿蜒如蛇。據說人被嚙。即犯耳聾之疾。又獅魚。其名爲獅實則其形如馬。但無蹄足耳。斑馬魚。身有斑點。一似斑馬。肉味鮮美可供烹割。蟹足魚。鰭作棒狀。絶類蟹足。云有大毒。人觸之可致死。俱陳列於菲律賓之水族館中。</p>
<p>黑海豚。獸體魚尾。產太平洋。</p>
<p>日本海中。有魚與人無異。而秃首有尾。謂之海和尚。</p>
<p>泥猴。一名海鯊體圓長。頭圓目突。鰓蓋有疣狀物。背蒼黑。腹白。兩旁有黑色圓斑四。尾爲扇狀。體長二三寸。棲於河口鹹淡水混交處。鰓部能貯水。腹鰭能匍匐。常匐行於退潮之沙灘。亦能飛躍。登岸便捷若猴。故名。或亦稱彈塗。與鰕虎之别名相同。</p>
<p>油身魚。一名鼬魚。體甚側扁而較短。頭部闊大。至尾漸尖細上。顎比下顎長。口旁有鬚數對。喉部有鞭狀體二對。由腹鰭所變化。脊臀尾三鰭相連接。體被滑澤橢圓形之櫛狀鱗。背部暗褐。腹面藍色。眼與鱗之色皆似鼬。體長八九寸至一尺三四寸、產於太平洋。棲於近海多礁處。</p>
<p>旗魚。體長達一丈三四尺。棲於遠洋。好游泳於水之上層。常以劍狀之上顎。剌食他魚或攻鑿船底及泥沙。肉淡紅。味佳。分布於太平洋地中海。大西洋亦產之。一名舵徹。或羽魚。</p>
<p>電光魚。美國沿海。有魚夜能發光。利於航行。不啻燈塔。</p>

<h3>與子同仇（九）</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第二章　志同事道合</p>
<p>從此他也看破了梅國的爲人。不大喜歡和他多說廢話。幸有忠淑時來顧談。且伴他到近處游玩。梅國已詢知華乃强是個窮光蛋。漸漸對他冷淡起來。過了兩個星期。他再也熬不住了。遂和忠淑告别。先回校中去。後來忠淑到校。二人在暇時談起忠淑的父親。忠淑也承認伊的父親是個軍閥。父女之間。宗旨不合。華乃强對忠淑說道。我看到尊大人的行爲。簡直不滿。他所談的話一句也不聽的。請你不要見怪。我不該當着你的面前說你父親的不是。最難堪的。那天痛打姨太太的一幕。使我心懐不平。若不是你的父親。我一定要。……華乃强說到這裏。頓了一頓。又說道。話又說還來了。目今那些握虎符坐臯比的大人物。擁兵自重。暴戾恣睢。能有幾個潔身自愛。爲國爲民呢。滔滔者天下皆是。豈獨令尊。說罷嘆了一口氣。忠淑聽了。面上一紅。說道。可不是麽。照這個樣子。中國那裏會好呢。看到我父親的行爲。使我也很慚愧。屢次勸諫他。終是不肯聽的。反說我不該多管閑事咧。華乃强道。這是個人的本性。不可相提並論。若像女士這樣深明大義。熱心愛國。却又不可多得的了。忠淑又不學嫣然一笑。自此華乃强知這忠淑的父親是這樣一個人物。很代伊惋惜。生在這個門閥中。也是不幸。當這事變發生的前一天。二人操練過後。一同坐在操塲西隅草地上。席地談話。黄金色的夕陽映照在他們背後一株大榆樹上。凉風吹得忠淑耳旁的短髮飄飄。忠淑將手掌磋着。對華乃强說道。我國外交何等樣的遲鈍。萬寳山慘案發生以來。好多時候了。只是没有辦法。難道弱國無外交。我國人只好白白地受人家屠殺麽。無知的鮮人。自己不知亡國的苦痛。甘心受人利用。可憐也是可恨。華乃强道。這是太陽國鮮人移民奬勵及保護政策的發展。他們把鮮民移住到我國來。便是代他們開拓土地。等到有事之秋。利用他們做軍事行動或大規模的衝突。更籍取締爲名。而援助鮮人的行動。好逞他們野心。他們覬覦我們的邊地。長久了。數十年來。無時無日不在進行之中。我看這次暴動。不過是一個試探。還有第二步的毒辣手段在着呢。</p>

<p>南頭　昨日天寒大風、呵下到頭寥寥、本街店胃轉活、常　北粳及蘇同白粳頓提二角、薄稻寗胃略有、售　爲穩、蘆洋尖貨色不多、價則高緊次定、早稻隨到隨銷、喊高尺許、洋米客銷不大、且有殺價、期價洋行續抛、市面平定、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日天氣不佳、常錫白粳來貨有限、零星稍有走化、頂次二種不見起色、店方購買存貨、無錫·崑山米各提二角、重固·松江薄稻到頭缺乏、形勢喊緊一角、洋杜尖來貨寥寥、河下及米廠稍有存貨、亦硬二角、糯米到銷二平、市無上落、西路米船、計常熟·崑由·丹陽·角里北㘮三十餘號、</p>
<h3>洋米看漲</h3>
<p>安南軍事行動影響　　昨日洋米市况、突呈活潑、各洋行停止續抛行家亦無回籠售出、因報載法軍在安南有軍事動作、西貢米或將禁止出運、因此人心望好、後市有步升之望、但目下客帮尚無發動、緬甸各地之定米尚多、行情能否步漲、尚有變化也、現米漢口帮停運、本街辦去一號西貢一百也、價十一元二角、小絞米五百包、價九元六角至九元三角半云、</p>
<h3>麵粉大跌小回頭</h3>
<p>昨日粉巾、大致呈大跌小回之象、以洋麥報價、回起二三角左右、兼之各廠方面、以前日大抛之後、已見觀望不前、因廠家凡有抛售、必須洋麥訂定、方肯套出、否則任其升沉、不稍過問故人心略定、市面亦回漲一二分、不過此後如洋麥續有問訉、則局面仍未許樂觀也、結果本月份較前日泚一分、一月份好一分、二月份至四月份各好二分二厘半、五月份好二分云、</p>
<h3>遠期麥反動回漲</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、呈近平遠漲之象、本月份因距交割、已祗一星期、業外買賣、均非了結不可如粉銷尚暢、則本月份之貨、廠家尚有收意、今時局如斯、前途當少希望、致市氣未能回佳、遠期各月份、個洋麥報好兼以空頭抵補頗暢、均見回漲、惟以大勢言、此種回風、實少脚地也、結果本月份較前日小一分、一月份大二分、二月份大五分、三四月份各大六分云</p>
<h3>南北貨　龍口粉隨到隨開</h3>
<p>市價略鬆</p>
<p>龍口線粉干日前因到存均稀、曾售二十四兩、兹由利生輪烟台轉到一批、昨聞已開三百數十包價爲二十三兩半至七錢、比前略鬆、現在各帮走場尚屬活動、行盤亦見同小、昨市規皮售二十三兩五錢、次之略减、趨勢平平、</p>
<h3>川榨菜下降廉宜</h3>
<p>四川榨菜　邇來銷路依然不暢、故客盤甚疲、最近下檔貨時有開出、價格廉宜、僅十二三元至於出口帮以及本街内地等處、採數均無大宗、是以市勢、一時難望振起、昨市行盤頂莊呌售十七八元、中莊十四五元不一下莊十三元左右、</p>
<h3>疋頭　嗶嘰銷滯價平</h3>
<p>元常藍灰雜色素嗶嘰　上月間頗爲活俏近來反有轉疲之象、蓋氣候漸寒、銷場呆滯、兼以年關逼近、各帮咸存收束之心、以致中厚嗶嘰等市銷驟减售價亦因之而改低、惟嗶嘰市面尚稱平穩、未見有特殊之下降耳、如寗豐彭壽圖售二兩六錢、德記大發財三兩七錢、天祥九九爲三兩六錢二分半、寳多七六三○爲三兩二錢半、東方三○○八中厚嗶嘰三兩五錢、永樂四兩五錢、實多五兩六錢五分</p>
<h3>絲茶洋莊絲市益疲</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、益呈淸疲、綠紐約里昂電告、華絲因受横濱日絲鋭跌之故、均趨疲勢、各歐莊益抱觀望市氣疲靜、昨祇怡和補進黄廠經十包、中和進白乾經十包、美大進黄粗絲五包、價仍平疲云、</p>
<h3>針秀眉法銷尚暢</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、路莊土莊兩路之針眉秀眉等綠茶、法屬摩洛哥市塲、已有來電訂購、全市計由錦隆怡和等行、買進二百餘箱、去路尚稱暢達市盤亦頗堅挺、至珍眉綠茶、中低莊貨、英莊進意尚殷、高莊仍無重大發展云、</p>

<h3>李景樅談試航新疆</h3>
<p>今日李氏作空前之長途飛行</p>
<p>對記者詳談西北試航之前後</p>
<p>日日社云　開闢邊遠航空專家交通部航空科科長、兼歐亞航空公司營運組主任李景樅氏、本年五月、曾越興安嶺·開闢北平至滿洲里之航線、已告成功、兹聞氏又定於今日（十三）作新疆之試航、此爲中國航空界空前之創舉、日日社記者、昨往謁李氏作長時間之談話承其將西北試航之前前後後、詳細見告、兹分誌如下</p>
<p>試航起因　西北航線、爲交通部靑成該公司舉辦之三大航線之一、該公司前因國人對於航空認識、尚甚薄弱、航空營業、難期發達、又因資本有限、對此世界僅有之長距離航線、難於頃刻籌辦、故曾决意留待三數年後、方行着手、嗣因黨政當局、舉國民衆、深感内地與邊遠之情形過於隔膜、消息過於阻滯、馴致政治文化國防實業等均受直接或間接之影響、幾於同聲要求、速行舉辦、該公司亦不願違反全國之屬望、不得不勉爲其難、又因本年七月間、於經過外蒙時、受蒙兵射擊、九月間於試航洮南時受日軍阻撓、遂决意不避艱苦先作西北試航、待成功後、再按實在情形、進作正式開航之準備、</p>
<p>選擇路線　該公司旣决意先行試航、遂由總經理雙淸、於十月間、派李氏及史密德二人、前往北平、從事籌備、籌備之第一要點、莫過於路線之選擇、李氏等根據地理及氣候關係、原擬採由滬而京、經豫陜甘直入新疆、長約四千公里之路線、蓋據調查、豫省雖多風、但一片平原、如有困難、隨時隨地、均可下降、不易發生意外情事、陜甘則氣候旣少强烈變化、山嶺復不十分高峻、且經過各大城市、均有飛行塲、或廣大平原、足資降落、徒因甘省土匪充斥、汽油無法運往、致不克選用、而採現在之由滬而京而魯經河北綏遠寗夏直入新疆、長約四千二百餘公里之航綫、此綫除由上海到北平一路坦途、毫無困難外、其由北平到綏遠之柏林廟·須經過叢山峻嶺、柏林廟至寗夏之弱水河、須經過曠漠荒野、弱水河至新疆之哈密亦然、且以上各地、均時有大風而氣候又皆嚴寒、由哈密至迪化、但據調查、可以下降之處尚多氣候亦好、絶不若由柏林廟至弱水河、弱水河至哈密兩站間之可怖可慮、蓋至兩站間、除經一定之路線外、萬一迷途、不　曠漠無邊、荒野無烟、且滴水毫無、足以制旅之死命、而此一定之路線、又因係沙土、偶遇大風、每易掩没、初次飛機試航、旣　觀瀏氣象及無線電設備、不幸遇此現象、而發動機適又發生情形、則眞不知將如何救援有旣好且適之陜甘腹地航線、竟因土匪充斥、汽油無法運往、不能使用、良可慨漢</p>
<p>運存汽油　除柏林廟離歸化僅百餘公里、汽油運往存儲、尚不困難外、其弱水河方面、已由該公司用重資聘雇熟悉該地情形之瑞典人瑞生恒、費四十餘日之時間、運往存儲、宜於飛機下降及能作地面目標之弱水河上流、離居延海南約數十公里之又河地方、蓋内地商人之往來於新疆者類皆成羣結隊、雇用蒙古人爲之嚮導、而作嚮導之蒙古人、除知由某站至某站應循何方前進、及循此路線應涉弱水河外、其所涉之地點、居於弱水河之何方、地　爲何、附近情形如何、及是否宜於飛機下降等、均茫然不知、開闢内地交通、亦須問道於客鄉、實亦慨嘆者、至新疆方面應備之汽油、已呈交通部托新疆省政府、就近代爲採　俄國飛機汽油、因俄鐵航線闢至新疆邊夑者已有兩線之多其汽油之存儲於邊境者、爲數亦頗鉅、向之讓購、較之由内地運往、須時三閱月爲迅速、且便宜也、</p>
<p>改善機件　西北航線、由北平至哈密、須經過長約二千公里之叢山峻嶺、曠漠　野、交通阻塞、人烟稀少地方、實爲世界　有之長距離不易辦之航線、故對於機件之選擇、總以能不易損壞、適於遠航、在紀錄上確具有相當之證明者爲宜、該公司對於試航所採用之飛機、即合於上開條件之　格賜W第三十三號式、全金屬機身、及榮格賜L第五號式、三百馬力發動機、載重力量一千二百公斤、飛行速度、每小時爲一百八十公里、耐久飛行爲十小時、即一千八百公里、他如乘員之禦寒、發動機之保温、以及濾水·防火·等員設備、均加特别改善、充份補添、　　人事方面　該公司於决意舉辦西北試航前　經呈請交通部電詢新省當局意見嗣得復電、蒙表歡迎、復蒙給以各種與航空有關之地面及氣候等報告、</p>
<p>該公司並經呈請交通部分電綏遠寧夏各省當局、通飭飛機經過之沿途軍警盟旗領首、充分保護協助、另由該總經理雙淸北上、坐鎭北平、應付一切、蓋北平爲滬新線全線之中樞、無論在技術或人事方面、如有意外情事發生、均以該地爲最便於接洽設法、故該公司對此種種準備、尤其是對於人事方面、諒不至發生困難、　　宣傳郵航　該公司除呈交通部轉呈國民政府、並咨行關係機關請其將最近寄往新疆之各種公文、交由該公司帶往外、並函郵政總局、分飭上海及北平郵政管理局、請其將最近由各該地寄往新疆之信件分别包封五分斤、交由該公司帶往、藉作郵航之試騐、别分函上海及北平各大報館、請其將當日新聞、每家各包封十份交由該公司帶往、以廣宣傳、此外該公司及中華週報社、復印有多種印刷、以便到迪化時、在空中分散、藉增西北民衆對於般空之認識</p>
<p>飛行時地　李氏定於今日（十三日）星期日、率歐亞三號赴平、在平休息一日十五日早八時、改乘歐亞一號、飛往柏林廟、此段計長五百二十餘公里、上午十時五十五分可到　到後約須布置半日、十六日早八時、即飛往弱水河、計由栢林廟至弱水河、共長七百八十餘公里、中午十二時二十分可到、到後亦布置半日、十七日早八時飛往哈密、由弱水河至哈密、共長六百六十公里、中午十一時四十分可到、到後亦須布置半日、十八日早八時飛往迪化、僅長四百六十餘公里、上午十時三十五分即可到、大約在迪化至少須有一星期之布置接洽、二十五日上午八時、可飛往塔城、由迪化至塔城、共長五百零公里、上午十時五十分可到、到後布置及接洽、約須一日又半、二十七日早七時、當能飛回迪化、由迪化一氣或仍分段飛回北平、則一視屆時情形、臨時而定、總之、如無氣候或其他障碍發生、年内定可回上海、向總公司報告切也、　　將來計劃　此線試航成功後、第一步當着手於機件之添購、人員之選聘、機場之開闢、廠棚之建築、汽油之運存、無綫電之裝設、以及氣候觀測、　救急衛生等必要之設備、凡兹種種至少須費三閱月以上至四閱月之時期、中間如無其他障碍情事發生、則來年四月底、或五月初、可以正式開航、第二步當着手與俄國商洽在新省中俄交界地方聨運、蓋歐亞郵航、非經過俄國、或與俄國聯運、則對於時間經濟所省有限、殊去航空迅速傳遞之本旨過遠、經過俄國一層、因中俄邦交尚未恢復、一時自談不到但在滿洲里與俄國聯運一節、則確已得俄人之贊允、此段旣已贊允、逆料將來改由新省中俄交界地方聯運、必不至發生疑問、况由滿洲里經俄國往歐洲、須六日、較之由新省經俄國往歐洲、僅須五日、在時間上又可縮减一日、非特爲歐亞人士所屬望、即俄國對兹有利無弊之世界事業、亦必更加樂予協助也、第三步即謀滬新間飛行日期之縮减、計由上海至新疆空綫、共長四千二百餘公里、飛行時間、約須二十四小時、除夏季尚可勉分兩日飛行外、冬季非三日不能完成、苟欲縮减飛行日期、非有夜間飛行設備不可、計此全綫上最適宜於夜間飛行設備者、當惟滬平一段、而最合於時間經濟原則者、則莫逾於栢林廟至哈密一段、徒因栢林廟至哈密一段所經過之地方、均係荒野曠漠、且時有大風、一時自不易舉辦、目前所可舉辦者、惟有滬平一段、滬平一段設備成功、則冬季由上海至新疆、須兩日一夜、而夏季僅須一日一夜可到矣、總之、此綫成功、無論對内對外、均有莫大之關係、李氏固極欣盼此行之不虚云云、</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>世界金融狀况（續）南心朱彬元編</h3>
<p>世界金融市塲中、凡所謂金價或銀價、係指金銀間的比價而言、但行金本位的國家、銀的漲落係以金法貨爲計算的標準、現銀買賣與他種物品没有什麽異同、故可謂祗有銀價、並無所謂金價的、至於我國社會上銅輔幣異常充斥、又與主幣間另有市價、於是在英美金融市塲上的銀價、在我國市塲上即發生二重意義了、這就是所謂「金銀比價」、編者在此、是將近十年來的情形、加以正確的比例、使讀者瞭解個中的眞象、在金價暴漲銀價低落的現今、這「金銀比價」是須重視的、</p>
<p>國際匯兌淸償國際債務的最普通的手段、所以匯價的漲落一以國際貸借關係的變遷緩急爲準則、造成貸借關係的因甚多、如對外貿易、外債本息、運費、保險費、規費、海外僑民匯欵、海外事業經費、駐外使節俸給等都是、此中尤以貿易與外債最關重要、關於此、編者在這「匯價」一節裏是詳述的極形明白的了、</p>
<p>第三章「庫存現金與紙幣流通額的增減及其影響」、庫存與紙幣流通額、是述歐戰正殷的時候、各國爲防止現金流出、一方面宣佈金禁、一方面將現金集中於中央銀行或國庫、以致庫存量日增無已、戰後的整理幣制計、此種集中、尤感需要、就近十年的數字觀之、却有「扶摇直上」之勢、其次、爲存金與紙幣的增減及於利息物價的影響、這有礙於我國市面當然是很大、因爲金庫存一有變動、首先隨之變動的爲利率、其次爲匯價、紙幣一有變動、首先隨之變動的爲物價、其次亦爲匯價、中國先前是採用銀本位制、所以這點也很重要的、</p>
<p>第四章「各國中央銀行狀况」　這是很足以供給研究銀行學的參考、（一）美國丨聯合準備銀于（二）法國丨法蘭西銀行、法國金融方面的最大事件、爲幣制的改革、因自前一時期停止兌現以來、法郎價格狂跌、幾經努力整頓、才於前年恢復穩定的狀態（三）德國丨國家銀行、德國經濟界年XX順利的餘蔭、情况尚佳、其後即漸趨衰頽、有數種工業因欲減低輸出物價、特將國内物價提高、以致國内市塲的購買力大爲减退、這都是有國家銀行的財庫的、（四）意國丨意大利銀行、（五）日本丨日本銀行、這在編者、都有極形詳細的表格及說明、很有借以資助的價値、</p>
<p>今日的世界、是一經濟競爭的世界、國運的隆替、民生的休戚、國的盛興與否、常以其經濟力的强弱的準則、所以我們如果要明白這點、非先窺視世界上的金融狀况如何、那麽、朱君此書、是値得我們注意的了、</p>

<h3>America's Determination to Maintain Peace Between China and Japan</h3>
<p>Hoover Reports on US Policy Regarding the Manchurian Incident to Congress</p>
<p>The Baitiqipu Station on the Beining Railway Looted by Bandits</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Actively Preparing for Military Operations in Shanhaiguan</p>
<h3>US President's Address to Congress</h3>
<p>Regarding All Negotiations on the Manchurian Incident</p>
<p>America Still Maintains Its Right to Freedom</p>
<p>(Washington) Yesterday, US President Hoover detailed to Congress the efforts of the US and the League of Nations to mediate the Manchurian Incident, stating that the US, as a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty, bears a solid responsibility for maintaining the territorial integrity of China. Therefore, the US, along with other nations, has an indirect or direct relationship in maintaining peace between China and Japan. He then described the historical development of the Manchurian Incident up to the present day and the efforts of all parties to maintain peace in the Far East, including China's appeal to the League of Nations. He further stated that the US government believes that it is wiser and more appropriate to assist the League of Nations so that the whole world can work together to maintain peace, rather than acting alone. However, regarding all negotiations on the Manchurian Incident, the US still retains complete autonomy in judgment and action. He then summarized the various notes exchanged between the US and China and Japan, stating that the US government has repeatedly advised both countries to respect their obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact, explaining the US's concern for the Manchurian Incident. The US government is deeply aware that in the crisis between China and Japan, anyone who wishes to maintain peace must have extreme patience and believes that American public opinion will also admire the wisdom of those who advocate peace with patience and prudence. Subsequently, after summarizing the recent resolution of the League of Nations Council, he reported on other issues, such as the decision to attend the Disarmament Conference next year, the recent visit of French Premier Laval to the US, and the decision to withdraw US Marines from Nicaragua.

<h3>American Newspapers Warn Japan</h3>
<p>The US State Department's Policy</p>
<p>Is to Uphold Both Treaties</p>
<p>New York The New York World-Telegram, a Scripps-Howard newspaper, published an editorial today entitled "Warning to Japan," stating that the Japanese government should understand the US State Department's policy, which relies on American public opinion. American public opinion is now paying close attention to upholding the two treaties that Japan has violated and will not disregard the repeated violations of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty. Merely ceasing hostilities while leaving Japanese troops or Japanese-controlled governments to rule over the Three Eastern Provinces cannot meet the requirements of these two treaties. If the Japanese, seeing the current inaction of the US, mistakenly believe that they can disregard the guarantee of troop withdrawal made to the League of Nations yesterday, they will make a grave mistake. If the Japanese do not make good use of this opportunity, they will incur the protests of the whole world, forcing the League of Nations and the US to jointly intervene immediately.

<h3>British League of Nations Union Severely Condemns Japan's Use of Force</h3>
<p>Cecil's Speech on Two Major Difficulties</p>
<p>London The Council of the British League of Nations Union today passed a resolution expressing the opinion that the actions of the League of Nations Council in Paris have prevented war between China and Japan and condemning the impropriety of a member of the League of Nations Council initiating hostilities in the Three Eastern Provinces. It stated that Japan should have used peaceful methods to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute before sending troops. For Japan's sake, it should have requested the League of Nations to engage in a peaceful resolution in September. It also condemned the impropriety of continuing hostilities in the Three Eastern Provinces, stating that since both sides have guaranteed to the League of Nations to cease hostilities, they should fulfill their promises and keep their word. Chairman Professor Murray, when reading this resolution, stated that the entire process of the Liaodong Incident has been greatly influenced by Japan's opposition to the League of Nations' machinery at the beginning of the Liaodong dispute. Currently, harmful movements are still underway, especially by the extreme right-wing arms companies in France, who are responsible for spreading prejudice against the League of Nations. British representative to the Paris Council, Cecil, today told the Council of the League of Nations Association that he dared to proceed with the responsibility of the Far Eastern dispute, as if two rioters were to blame. The two major difficulties encountered in Paris were Japan's militarism and China's lack of political stability. (Eleventh National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Drafting Committee Remains in Paris to Work</h3>
<p>Candidates for Investigators Still Under Consideration</p>
<p>(Paris) From today onwards, most of Drummond's colleagues will return to Geneva, but several senior officials of the League of Nations Secretariat will remain in Paris to assist the Drafting Committee in continuing to meet. The Drafting Committee has now become a committee of the Executive Yuan, organized by the Manchurian Investigation Team, which monitors the Manchurian situation and prevents any future events. The members of the committee include Cecil (England), Madariaga (Spain), and Colban (Norway), all of whom are capable members of the Executive Yuan. The committee also maintains daily contact with Briand. League of Nations Deputy Secretary-General Avenol has traveled to the Far East, and now Drummond is working on the Drafting Committee. The organization of the Investigation Team is not easy. Under difficult circumstances of compromise, the choice of members should be based on individual merit, but the major powers that are permanent members of the Executive Yuan have the opportunity to obtain positions for members of the team. If small countries also nominate representatives, and some of them are sufficient to bring glory to the country, then the number of people in the team may be changed to six. However, Japan advocates that a smaller number is better, so it is unlikely to increase the number of people. As for the candidates recommended by the Drafting Committee, because they must obtain the consent of both China and Japan, it is not possible to act arbitrarily. For example, Germany nominated Solf, but China opposed it, which is a clear example. The French side has not yet decided on candidates, and some advocate that military personnel should serve. Each country's delegation has submitted multiple candidates, requesting the Drafting Committee to freely select them. (Eleventh Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Drafting Committee of the League of Nations Executive Council will convene in Paris in the middle of next week to first consider reports from Nanjing and Tokyo on the progress of the Manchurian Incident, and then handle the important task of selecting candidates for the Investigation Team. It is rumored that several candidates have been selected for the Far East Investigation Committee, but this statement has been denied. In fact, no one has been selected yet. The Executive Council has adjourned, and most of the members have dispersed, but the Japanese officialdom here still has very close contact with the League of Nations. The Japanese still claim that the Japanese government and army demolished the Xinmin Telegraph Bureau, the Baitiqipu Station on the Beining Railway was looted, and students in Taiyuan destroyed the Jin Province Government (see Domestic News). Inukai Tsuyoshi was ordered to form a cabinet, and the new president of Spain was sworn in (see Foreign News). Li Jingcong talked about Northwest Air Defense, and the National Government denied arresting the four university presidents (see Local News).</p>

<p>Preparing to negotiate directly with Nanjing based on the five basic points proposed by Yoshizawa at the last Executive Council meeting in Geneva. However, China had previously rejected these basic points, not agreeing to its demand that China recognize various unilateral treaties of Japan as a prerequisite for Japan's troop withdrawal. Now, China has not yet expressed any change in its previous views, so negotiations may not be able to begin immediately. People here generally know that it is difficult to determine when the Japanese will consider safety to have been restored. The Japanese in Paris said that the Japanese government is now in close contact with the Chinese Public Safety Committees everywhere. It is found that this kind of committee was established when the Japanese army occupied Manchuria to maintain public order. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Non-Aggression Treaty Established Based on Article Eleven of the League of Nations Charter</h3>
<p>Germany First to Sign</p>
<p>(Geneva) Germany today signed the Non-Aggression Treaty established based on Article Eleven of the League of Nations Charter, according to which the Manchurian dispute is being considered. The signatory countries agree to withdraw their troops when the Executive Council asks them to withdraw, and the resolution does not need to be approved by the parties concerned. The signatory countries also agree that if the Executive Council believes that the situation requires the establishment of a neutral zone, it can do so. According to reports, the agreement has now been signed by twelve countries, including Austria, Belgium, Chile, Spain, and Portugal. Germany is the first of the permanent member states of the Executive Council to sign the agreement. (Twelfth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Will the Japanese Army Attack Jinzhou?</h3>
<p>The First Issue to Be Considered by the New Japanese Cabinet</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources, the question of whether to send another division and a half of Japanese troops to Manchuria to force Zhang Xueliang to withdraw the Chinese troops in Jinzhou into the customs will be the first thing that the new Japanese cabinet must consider after its establishment. It is heard that Minister of the Army Minami consulted Minister of Finance Inoue on this matter, but Inoue did not agree for financial reasons. Reports from Shenyang that an ultimatum on the withdrawal of troops from Jinzhou will be sent to Zhang Xueliang have not been confirmed, but the responsible party has not effectively denied it. It is clear that the Japanese are determined to eradicate Zhang Xueliang's last forces in Manchuria, but they will first use peaceful methods. If these are ineffective, they will use force. Japanese military authorities believe that Jinzhou is Zhang Xueliang's base for directing military and political activities, which is detrimental to the Japanese base in Manchuria, and they believe that the existence of this base will make it impossible for peace to be restored in Manchuria, allowing Japanese troops to withdraw. From this, it can be seen that the rumor from Shenyang that the local Japanese army authorities are preparing to send an ultimatum to Zhang Xueliang through the Japanese Embassy in Beiping is not entirely without reason. It is heard that this ultimatum will accuse Zhang Xueliang of instigating bandits and Chinese soldiers to collude, disrupt peace and security, and endanger the lives and property of Japanese people, and will warn that if his troops do not withdraw into the customs and cease activities within the specified time limit, the Japanese army will take active action.

<h3>Baitiqipu Station on the Beining Railway Looted</h3>
<p>Bandits Fired at the Stationmaster's Office</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Baitiqipu stationmaster telegraphed the director of the Beining Railway, stating that after train 101 left the station, eight bandits suddenly arrived and looted the clothes, luggage, and belongings of the workers at the station. All the workers are working at risk, without food or clothing, and are extremely uneasy. They request assistance, otherwise they will not be able to work. The bureau has tried to provide assistance. (Twelfth Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Dahushan states that on the 11th at midnight, many bandits were discovered at the Baitiqipu station and fired at the stationmaster's office three times. They retreated without success. The Japanese army occupied the vehicles between Masanjiazi and Xinglongdian and transported many airplanes from the South Manchurian Railway. Yesterday, train 105 from Beiping to Huanggu Village did not pass. After negotiations between the head of the Huanggu Village section and the Japanese side, they only allowed it to run to Baitiqipu.

<h3>Xinmin Telegraph Bureau Has Been Demolished by the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Telegrams from Shenyang Are Generally Subject to Japanese Inspection</p>
<p>(Shenyang) It is heard that the Japanese troops near Xinmintun have demolished the Chinese telegraph bureau there, and all the machines have been removed. The bureau has been abandoned. It is found that the Xinmintun Telegraph Bureau is a station for receiving and sending international telegrams without being inspected by the Japanese. Now that the bureau has been abandoned, telegrams from Shenyang must be sent through the Japanese post office in Shenyang or the Chinese telegraph bureau currently managed by the Japanese. Therefore, all telegrams will be subject to Japanese inspection. (Twelfth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Honjo Sends Personnel to Interfere with the Administration of Harbin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Honjo sent 21 staff members of the Kwantung Army to Harbin, nominally as military liaison officers in Harbin, but in reality, they are monitoring Zhang Jinghui. Recently, Zhang has become increasingly pro-Japanese and has allowed the personnel sent by Honjo to reside in the official residence. Every time he receives a telegram, he hands it over to the Japanese to read first and discusses how to reply with them. Therefore, although the Japanese army has not advanced into Harbin, Harbin is already in the hands of the violent Japanese. (Eleventh Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Buying Off Bandits</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Jinzhou states that the Japanese army stationed in Xinmin has used 20,000 silver dollars to buy off two bandit leaders, Lao Tizi and Yejilang, and two Mongolian bandit leaders, Zhanbei and Xiaobian. The bandits under their command, about 1,700 people, have been organized into the National Self-Defense Army. The daily cost of personnel, horses, and grain is 800 yuan, which is forced to be supplied by the local people. The Japanese in Xinmin, Liaoning, and other places are manufacturing many fetters, the purpose of which is unknown. (Twelfth Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Negotiations Between the Beining Railway and the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Agrees to Railway Police Escorting Trains</p>
<p>(Beiping) The head of the Beining Railway, the Englishman Spillett, negotiated with the Japanese consul in Xinmin. The Japanese agreed that the Chinese side could send 20 railway police officers on each passenger train to protect passengers. (Twelfth Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army has limited the Beining Railway's protection team and ballast car to operating from Dahushan to Liuhegou. Only 20 police officers escort the passenger train forward from Liuhegou. The armored car is not allowed to proceed. (Twelfth Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Beining Railway was closed yesterday. It is now known that this was caused by the Japanese authorities transporting 1,000 tons of railway sleepers. The train is running today, but the train to Beiping departed four hours late. The general opinion in Shenyang is that there will be no trouble in Manchuria until the new Japanese government is established, but after the new cabinet is formed, there will be actions in Manchuria.

<h3>Zhang Haipeng's Troops Maintain Order in Taonan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Dahushan states that order in Taonan is maintained by Li Shutian, the regimental commander under Zhang Haipeng. The city's police and military police are under his control. Zhang Haipeng distributed leaflets in Taonan to defame Wan Fulin and his son, but the Japanese still sent many soldiers to be stationed in the Mongolian Border Supervising Office, which is monitored by the South Manchurian Railway Company.

<h3>German Newspaper Ridicules the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German public opinion has generally neither affirmed nor denied the achievements made by the League of Nations Council in four weeks. It only repeats the words of the German Council representative, MUTHESIUS, congratulating the League of Nations, saying that based on the different interests of various countries, what the world expects cannot exceed this. It is gratifying that the League of Nations can leave itself room for retreat and resolve a major global crisis. However, the anti-government local newspaper, Indication, expressed dissatisfaction with the international actions and ridiculed them. The newspaper said: "The failure of the League of Nations is extremely regrettable, and this matter cannot be concealed or avoided. People in the League of Nations all hope that it can issue orders, but now it only follows the orders of the strong. We dare not say whether the Manchurian Incident has been resolved, but the credibility of the League of Nations has been swept away. This is truly gratifying (echoing MUTHESIUS's tone at the Council's general meeting). Because the disguise of the League of Nations has been removed, and the League of Nations has exposed its true colors to the world. What is meant by its true colors is just a tool of French policy."

<h3>Beining Railway Delayed Due to Wind</h3>

<h3>Zhongda President Telegraphed Students' Parents Again</h3>
<p>Zhu Jiahua Submitted His Resignation Three Times</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Jiahua, President of National Central University, again telegraphed the students' parents on the 11th to recall their children at school. The telegram read as follows: "The telegram of the 7th requesting you to recall your children at school should have been noted. The students are full of vigor, and especially at a time when national hatred has not been avenged, their feelings of anger are most easily touched. The problem now lies in the fact that villains take the opportunity to spread their heresies, and unscrupulous people use public loyalty to vent their private anger, harming young people, making them self-conscious, such as the secretary-general Guo who was injured the other day, Central News Agency employees, police officers, and students from other schools, even arbitrarily detaining and using torture, all of which violate discipline and the law, and are different from loving the country and saving the nation. However, in reality, these are mostly the actions of a few people, not necessarily the public will. There are also slogans that are posted and shouted, many of which are absurd and out of place, violating the constitution and causing concern for your parents. Jiahua has several nephews studying abroad, and they have now all been telegraphed to return home for close care. Loving the students is like loving family children, and although I have only been with them for more than ten months since the beginning, I dare not forget the past feelings even if I resign from my current position. Therefore, I am telegraphed again to your parents to recall your children at school immediately to avoid being swayed by extremists. I would be very grateful. Since the students have voluntarily gone on strike, and the school has been ordered to take a vacation ahead of schedule, the students should return home at this time. As for the unfinished courses, they will be taught again in the next semester, so that there will be no great loss to their studies. Sincerely yours, Zhu Jiahua." (Twelfth Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Jiahua, President of National Central University, submitted his resignation three times on the 12th, saying that the students' actions had gone beyond the bounds and were becoming increasingly serious. On the 9th, he was ordered to take a vacation ahead of schedule, and the students said that he had forged a ministerial order and spread it as a crime. His credibility was lost, and he could no longer continue to be responsible. (Twelfth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Decision to Reduce and Issue Political Expenses for Various Agencies</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Due to budget cuts, the Finance Committee previously issued a declaration based on the current financial situation, stipulating monthly political expenses of 4.5 million yuan and military expenses of 18 million yuan. This resolution will be implemented uniformly starting from November. The allocation method will be a pro-rata reduction of the original budget of each agency, with each agency experiencing a reduction of approximately 20% to 25%. The planned expenses for last month can be issued according to the new decision. However, because the Finance Committee repeatedly exchanged opinions, the original proposal was not passed, so the payment order was not signed. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has compiled a detailed list of the expenses of various agencies and the central government's income and planned expenditures for last month, preparing to submit it to the next finance meeting.

Fang Wencan's invitation for students to participate in the Anti-Japanese Association seems to conflict with the newly promulgated regulations. Schools decided to hold a demonstration parade.

<p>(Nanjing) The initial plan for the 80 million yuan financial bond was to issue it in installments later to comply with the original agreement limit of the Shanghai Conference. However, with the end of the year approaching, military and political expenses are urgently needed, and various parties are urging payment. In order to maintain the status quo and year-end order, the financial authorities had no choice but to decide to issue it the day before yesterday. The regulations have been promulgated by the government. The Ministry of Finance's Bond Division yesterday drafted the issuance guidelines based on the bond regulations, preparing to submit them to Minister of Finance Song Ziwen for approval next week, after which they can be announced. Regarding the underwriting issue, Song Ziwen has met with Shanghai banking circles several times and dispatched Zhang Shouyong, Deputy Minister of Finance, and Zheng Lai, Director of the Bond Division, to be responsible for the liaison. The banking circles also believe that in the face of national crisis, the government's economic strength should be consolidated, so they are willing to provide full assistance to the underwriting and mortgage of the bond. It is reported that before the bond certificates are printed, the practice of issuing subscription warrants will continue. These subscription warrants are scheduled to be issued starting next week by the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Office and the Central Bank, mortgaged at 75% of face value, to obtain 60 million yuan in cash. It is reported that more than 20 banks, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, Kincheng Banking Corporation, Continental Bank, and China South Sea Bank, are underwriting the treasury bonds. The amount they can accommodate is based on capital and not on a pro-rata allocation standard. Officials at the Ministry of Finance said that if this bond is issued, the end of the year can be weathered steadily. (December 12th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The True Meaning of Freedom of Speech</h3>
<p>The newspapers in the Japanese concession have been detained for no reason. This fact is clearly illegal. The Japanese Newspaper Association has already declared a protest and decided to absolutely refuse any inspection or interference from now on. Now, please elaborate on the legal and factual aspects of freedom of speech and publication to clarify the true meaning of freedom of speech.</p>
<p>The so-called freedom of speech and publication, from a legal standpoint, has an absolute sanctity that cannot be violated by any person or any force. Humans are social animals, born with the ability to think. Thinking inevitably expresses itself in speech to elicit social responses in order to expand the function of thought. To further develop individual thought, to open up the treasury of knowledge, to enhance the welfare of humanity, freedom of speech and publication is extremely noble. Each person enjoys this basic human right, provided that they do not abuse this right to endanger the welfare of the public. No one should be subjected to special privilege that exceeds the norm and allows for infringement. Gagging someone and saying, "This can be said," or "This cannot be said," restricting someone's central nervous system and saying, "This can be thought," or "This cannot be thought," obscuring someone's eyes and ears and saying, "This can be seen and heard," or "This cannot be seen and heard," is not allowed. Of course, in the interest of maintaining the welfare of the entire society, we cannot deny that the public has this special coercive power. However, stubbornly adhering to a concept that does not conform to public opinion, observing a person's words and deeds through a designated path, and making biased judgments from a subjective standpoint, this kind of unfair coercive power is an obstacle to humanity. Moreover, we sincerely do not understand whether those who exercise this coercive power can be certain that what they do is absolutely correct. They are ordinary people and not divinely blessed sages. If what they do is not correct, then they themselves are defying the public will of humanity, disturbing the order of society, and using force to obtain illegitimate and dishonorable special privileges. People are not all infants in swaddling clothes. Even infants have the freedom to cry and laugh, the freedom to coo and babble. No one can impose restrictions. Therefore, a Western proverb says, "Good government is not a substitute for self-government." We can further expand its meaning and declare, "True self-government must have true freedom. The true public will of humanity also depends on the true freedom of speech of humanity."</p>
<p>Precisely because freedom of speech and publication is so deeply related to individuals and humanity, all countries in the world regard it as a basic right that citizens should enjoy, and specifically accept the public will of society, solemnly publishing it as law and guaranteeing it. On April 20th of last year, our government also clearly ordered, "...Within the scope of jurisdiction of the Republic of China, no individual or organization may infringe upon the bodily freedom and property of others through illegal acts. Violators will be severely punished according to the law." Freedom of speech and publication is a part of the scope of freedom. Article 15 of Chapter 2 of the Provisional Constitution, which was passed by the National Assembly this year, also clearly stipulates, "The people have the freedom to express opinions and publish works. It shall not be prohibited or restricted except in accordance with the law." As stipulated by the government order and the Provisional Constitution, freedom of speech and publication is legal, and unwarranted restrictions are illegal. Public opinion is law. Now, interfering with freedom is no longer public opinion. The law guarantees freedom. Now, infringing on freedom violates the law. Therefore, from the perspective of the welfare of humanity and from the legal perspective, freedom of speech and publication should have absolute sanctity, and unwarranted infringement should not be allowed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from a factual observation, the politics of a country should be a manifestation of the public actions of the people of that country. How can the people influence and promote politics? It lies in directly appealing to the public with their thoughts, experiences, and actions. Therefore, expressing one's thoughts based on rational judgment for public reference in order to enhance public welfare is a sacred duty that humanity owes to humanity and the way in which citizens serve the country. Obstructing the exercise of this sacred duty is hindering the progress of human thought and hindering the enhancement of human welfare.</p>
<p>Those who advocate interference today say, "Has speech not deviated from the norm?" "Will publication not hinder the public?" "Will it not disrupt the current national system and destroy the current order?" This is indeed the case. However, human society has existed for four or five thousand years. Human civilization has different dynasties and different centuries. The torrent of history has turned out new trends based on human needs and agitation. What was right yesterday is wrong today, and what is wrong today may be right tomorrow. Looking back at history, where is the norm? And what is the norm? Since there is no norm, there is no such thing as deviation, and there is no such thing as disruption and destruction. Natural development is the norm. The advancement of freedom is the norm. If we must stubbornly adhere to old traditions and prevent new trends, imprisoning the thoughts, words, and deeds of the entire nation, it is not only impossible in theory but also absolutely impossible in fact.</p>
<p>What's more, people's thoughts and words do not arise by chance. In this society, if people have these thoughts and words, then this society must have the causes that produce these thoughts and words. If these thoughts and these words can truly shake the national system and destroy the order, then this country and this society must have deep-seated problems and must have had exploitable gaps. Chaos is not something that ordinary people desire, but it happens. It must be because the government has first lost the love of the people. Therefore, speech is an index of people's hearts and minds, and it is also a manifestation of public opinion. If it becomes a tide of the times, then it will be turbulent and unstoppable. What has been the effect of the literary inquisitions that have arisen in China and abroad throughout history? The past is present. We may as well look back today.</p>
<p>If we want politics to reach the realm of rationality, we must have fair public opinion, which means we must have responsible speech. Therefore, the government can only accept the public will of the people and widely adopt the speech of the people as a standard for improvement. It must not gag the mouths of the people and prevent them from speaking, restrict the nerves of the people and prevent them from thinking. The British political scholar Laski has said, "The government benefits more from the criticism of opponents than from the praise of supporters in order to consult widely. Blocking the criticism of the people is planting the root of one's own destruction." In fact, there must be a root of destruction before the people can criticize. If one then suppresses it, it is like avoiding treatment for an illness, and the result will only hasten one's own destruction. Therefore, the government should not judge the correctness of all actions of the people based on its own position and interests, but should consider and accept its own shortcomings, so that the public becomes the driving force for its own advancement, and it should not make itself an obstacle to the stagnation of the public. In the face of the tide of the times, in the face of public action, no obstacle can exist. The extreme of suppression and restriction is that the people cannot speak, and thousands of people are watching and pointing fingers. Where can the pressure be applied? This is from the standpoint of fact. Freedom of speech and publication cannot be infringed upon without reason, and even more so.</p>
<p>Currently, our country is facing great difficulties. Breaking through national difficulties is the responsibility of the people. Therefore, the people should express their opinions and contribute their thoughts at any time, and the government should sincerely adopt the public will of the people and adopt the speech of the masses as a policy for saving the country. The government recently decided to organize a national crisis conference, and Mr. Wang Jingwei also advocated the establishment of a national salvation conference, while Mr. Hu Hanmin even advocated the permanent establishment of a representative body of the people. This means that public opinion is important today, and the speech of the masses is even more essential. The government does not have time to adopt it, let alone suppress it. From a legal point of view, no one is above the law, so it is not allowed to violate the law and infringe on the rights of others. From the standpoint of fact, no one can suppress the vast public opinion, nor can they interfere with the speech of others without reason. We dare to assert that if the people are free, the country is free. If the people are imprisoned and lose their vitality, the future of the country will be dim and its vitality for survival will be lost.</p>

<h3>Inauguration of the New President of Spain</h3>
<p>The Republican Banner Flies</p>
<p>National Holiday Celebration</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance Proposes the Recovery of Telephone and Telegraph Management - Madrid Dispatch, November 11th, National - Today is the day that the new President of Spain, Zamora, takes his oath of office. Therefore, today has been designated a national holiday for celebration. Since this morning, Republican banners have been flying atop various buildings in the capital city, marking the end of the transitional period between the monarchy and the formal Republican government. Today, the new President also reviewed the Madrid Royal Guard, a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Madrid Dispatch, November 11th, National - Spanish Finance Minister Boretto presented a bill in Congress today to cancel the contract signed with the International Telephone and Telegraph Company during the Rifian era in 1924. Boretto's proposal argues that all the company's assets should be recovered and managed by the Ministry of Post and Communications on behalf of the Spanish Republic. Compensation should be given for the recovered assets, but the compensation should be much smaller than the acquisition price stipulated in the original contract. Given the current organization and attitude of the Spanish parliament, there is no doubt that this bill will be passed, but it is feared that this will cause international disputes. Furthermore, the government stated that the contract signed between the then-Spanish dictatorial government and the American company was an illegal agreement given the special circumstances at the time, and claimed that there were many shady dealings, with bribes of no less than 500,000 yuan distributed to various parties involved, and the former royal family was also suspected.</p>

<p>Brüning Declares Suspension of Reparations</p>
<p>Like a Bolt from the Blue for the French</p>
<p>Washington Dispatch, November 11th, Reuters - Although President Hoover urged Congress yesterday to quickly approve his war debt moratorium plan, it is now known that Congress may not be able to approve it before December 15th. However, government officials are handling the situation calmly. Today, Mills of the State Department said that the failure of Congress to immediately approve the plan is considered a procedural matter by the administration, and foreign governments that owe the US debt need not worry. After Congress debated the war debt moratorium plan today, the government reiterated its opposition to canceling war debts. Treasury Secretary Mellon issued an article stating that President Hoover's proposal does not imply the cancellation of war debts, but it is undeniable that some debtor nations cannot cope with debt payments until their economies have substantially recovered. We ourselves have undertaken to ascertain the debtor nations' ability to pay. If we insist on the original agreement now, it will not only be unfair to the debtor nations but also derelict in our duty to the American people. Mellon spoke of the plight of the European people and said that the United Kingdom has increased its burden on the United States by almost half since suspending the gold standard because the UK must use expensive US dollars to pay US debt, while other countries must use cheap British currency to pay British debt.</p>
<p>Paris Dispatch, November 11th, National - French newspapers expressed surprise and deep anxiety about the so-called global united resistance to reparations payments. French newspapers stated that Hoover in Washington, Chamberlain in London, Grandi in Rome, and Brüning in Berlin have simultaneously raised the banner against the reparations plan, challenging France's rights over Germany. German Chancellor Brüning recently stated that Germany can absolutely no longer continue to pay reparations. This declaration made a profound impression on the French. Although this statement cannot be called a bolt from the blue, the fact that Germany has adopted such an unprecedentedly radical attitude at this time is indeed enough to shock the French. The reaction to Brüning's remarks, namely the indignation of the entire German public, all claimed that Germany, no matter what, would not abandon its claim to debt rights, and would not give in even if the whole world rose up against France. French public opinion is extremely consistent, but there is one exception, namely the Republican newspaper, which published an editorial written by Daladier, leader of the extreme Socialist faction, warning France not to be too monotonous and isolate itself from the world, and stating that the modern crisis can only be overcome by the combined efforts of all countries in the world, so it is hoped that the French authorities can look to the future and resolutely cooperate with the world to save their neighbors as self-salvation.</p>

<h3>Local Tyrants from Hei Province Come to Harbin to Greet Zhang</h3>
<p>Zhang Jinghui Still Not Showing Any Overt Signs</p>
<p>Japanese Army Pressuring the Hei Army Along the Qike Road</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence - Ying Shun, the Deputy Director of the Special Police sent by Zhang Jinghui to Hei Province to administer the power, returned to Harbin yesterday morning (the 5th). Those who came with him included former Hei Province Police Chief Liu Dequan, Banner Army Commander Ji Xiang, and eighteen representatives of gentry and merchants. In the afternoon, Ying led them to see Zhang, asking Zhang to go to Hei Province immediately to preside over government affairs and organize the Heilongjiang Provincial Government. Zhang has not yet agreed to go. The representatives are still waiting for news in Harbin today. Yesterday, someone saw Zhang, and Zhang still said that he would never be a traitor and would not leave Harbin for Hei Province. However, Zhao Zhongren, who is running errands for Zhang, is still constantly threatening Ma Zhanshan in Hailun, demanding that he hand over the seals of office. Zhang's attitude is still not showing any overt signs. The guard team sent by Zhang to Hei Province had already begun to serve and maintain order, but a few days ago, the Japanese army in Hei Province, upon hearing rumors that Ma Zhanshan was planning to lead troops back to attack, fearing that the guard team would attack from both inside and outside the city, once confiscated their weapons. They were not returned until the day before yesterday. Currently, the Japanese army is especially concerned about a counterattack by the Hei army. They post sentries every night, guarding as far as a dozen miles around the city. After 7:00 PM, pedestrians are prohibited, and the police are closely inspecting the residents' household registration around the city, fearing that plainclothes soldiers from Ma's faction will enter the city. Most of the Japanese army's cavalry and artillery are successively arriving in Hei Province from the Jinxi area. Currently, the Japanese army is stationed along the Taoang Road Nenjiang Bridge all the way to Qiqihar city. Two armored trains have also been driven to Qiqihar and will be driven into the Qike Road. The three major camps in Hei Province, north, south, and east, are all full of Japanese troops, totaling more than 5,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery. It is said that this unit belongs to the Suzuki Mixed Brigade. The army was opened from Hirosaki, Korea on the 14th of last month. The second division of Domen has been transferred back to Changji as a reserve force in the rear. Brigade Commander Suzuki arrived in Hei on the 6th of this month, and the Commander of the Kwantung Army, Honjo, commissioned him to be responsible for military affairs in Hei. The brigade began to advance along the Qike Road on the 5th, with more than 1,000 cavalrymen stationed at the Haoguantun post, taking a threatening stance against the Hei army. In addition, 500 cavalrymen are protecting dozens of workers dispatched by the South Manchuria Railway, advancing to the Tahar River, 45 li away from Ningnian Station, forcibly building a bridge over the river in preparation for advancing forward. It is rumored that there was a conflict between the two armies the night before last (the 4th), but it is not confirmed. On December 2nd, Ma Zhanshan took the head of the guard regiment, Xu Maizhen, and the commander of the first brigade of infantry, Yuan Chonggu, to the Keshantai'an area to deploy defenses. Because the artillery strength of each brigade team could not be united, they were specially concentrated into one regiment, compiled into the 55th regiment, and sent the chief of staff of the third brigade of infantry, Lieutenant Colonel Shi Lanbin, as the regimental commander, stationed in Lindian County, forming an angle with the defenses along the Maike Road line, in order to restrain the Japanese army when the opportunity arises for a counterattack. The number of young students from various places who came to join the army is very large. Ma has ordered them to be compiled into a training detachment and trained in Hailun. On the evening of the 3rd, Ma returned to the province. After hearing the news of the Japanese soldiers entering the province, he ordered the cavalry regiment stationed at the Tahar River to retreat to Ningnian, and contact the cavalry regiment to return to defense. Another envoy, Park Cheng, went to Keshan on the evening of the 5th to coordinate with the cavalry commander Zhi Zhiyuan to plan a strategy for resisting the enemy. Currently, Ma's intention is that an isolated army is trapped in a desperate situation. A rash counterattack will result in significant losses regardless of victory or defeat. Even if Hei Province is captured, the Japanese army will definitely counterattack with all its strength, and it will still be difficult to hold it. Therefore, at present, he is temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude, actively replenishing the army's strength. Once the central government has a clear order to recover the lost territory, a large-scale mobilization will be carried out. If not, he fears that the current remnants will fight again in a hasty manner, and after retreating, there will be no way to salvage the situation. However, the Japanese army is afraid of Ma Zhanshan's counterattack, so it is using both threats and inducements. On the one hand, it is deploying troops from Qike Road to advance, taking on the appearance of an attack. On the other hand, Honjo sent his staff officer Sakatani and others to Harbin to persuade Zhang Jinghui to mediate with Ma, advising Ma to follow the method in Domen's previous letter, return to Hei Province to serve as the provincial chairman or garrison commander. Sakatani and others arrived in Harbin the day before yesterday, and Zhang Jinghui immediately contacted Ma Zhanshan by telephone. Ma said that he had no need to negotiate directly with the Japanese, and that the military and civilians in Hei Province were in high spirits. If the Japanese representative must come to Hailun to meet, there would be danger, and he would not be responsible. Seeing Ma's firm attitude, Sakatani dared not go to Hailun and is still in Harbin trying to persuade Ma by other means. As for Domen Sojiro, the commander of the Japanese Second Division who had previously led Ma to attack Hei Province, he has been transferred back to Liaoning. The day before he left, the local tyrants of Hei Province were extremely flattering and specially held a grand banquet to see him off. Domen, drunk, revealed that the Japanese army's attack on Hei Province this time was unexpected, and the losses were the heaviest since the occupation of the Northeast. His younger brother, a major general brigade commander, was killed in battle at Sanjianfang. Among the soldiers under his command who died, those who were not yet married numbered over 800, not including others. The words came from the mouth of the head of the beastly army, from which it can be known how bloody the Hei army was. (December 6th)</p>

<h3>He Siyuan Escorts School Principals to Beijing</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - In order to prevent students from various schools from going to Beijing to petition, Han Fuju ordered the Education Department the day before yesterday to suspend all expenses for schools participating in the petition from the date of the petition. However, this failed to stop the students from going south. The principals and teachers of various schools jointly submitted a letter of resignation to the Education Department yesterday. He Siyuan, the Director of the Education Department, immediately went to the Provincial Government to discuss solutions with Han Fuju. Han decided to stop the disbursement of funds there and not here. Since the students had already gone to Beijing, the funds would still be disbursed as usual. The secretariat of the Provincial Government immediately notified the Education Department and instructed the principals to stay in their positions. He said that the Ministry of Education had sent a telegram ordering him to escort the principals and responsible personnel of the petitioning schools to Beijing to help handle the student petitions. Han Fuju also firmly urged him to go. He specially accompanied the principals and responsible personnel, a total of sixteen people, to Beijing on the Pupu 201 train at 9:30 AM today (the 11th). However, the student special train was still stopped in Lincheng yesterday morning and did not arrive in Xu until late in the evening. It is still unknown whether it can go south. The actual number of students from various schools who went to petition is as follows: Women's Normal School 122, Women's Vocational School 3, Girls' Middle School 15, First Normal School 456, First Vocational School 64, First Rural Normal School 42, Qilu Middle School 50, Donglu Middle School 44, High School 525, Yuying Middle School 306, Zhengyi Middle School 297, Aimei Middle School 256, First Middle School 380, totaling 2,632 people.

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>A Part of Japan's Illegal Pending Cases (3)</h3>
<h3>The Case of the Massacre of Overseas Chinese During the Japanese Earthquake</h3>
<p>During the great earthquake in Japan in September 1923 (Year 12 of the Republic of China), the Japanese took the opportunity to cruelly harm overseas Chinese. According to the investigation of the facts by the special envoy of our country, it can be divided into three items: (1) The case of the massacre of Chinese laborers in Oshima-cho. In the 1st to 8th Chome of Oshima-cho outside Tokyo City, there were more than 2,000 Chinese laborers. After the earthquake, Japanese self-defense corps, police, and soldiers induced the Chinese laborers to hand over all their money and forced them to the vicinity of the 8th Chome, where they were beaten to death with knives and sticks and the corpses were destroyed with kerosene to cover up the traces. The remaining Chinese laborers were transferred to barracks by the Japanese army for custody and then sent back to China. There is a Chinese person who recovered from death, as well as Japanese gentlemen and newspapers as evidence. (2) The case of the murder of student Wang Xitian. After the earthquake, Wang Xitian went around to provide relief to Chinese laborers. He suddenly disappeared in Tokyo on September 12. On that day, Japanese armed soldiers tied up Wang Xitian and detained him in the Kamedo Police Station in Tokyo. After that, his whereabouts were unknown. The Japanese side falsely claimed that he had been released, but he was undoubtedly murdered. There are Chinese people and the Salvation Army's memorial service on the same day as evidence. (3) The case of the murder of Chinese laborers and students in Yokohama and its vicinity. In Yokohama, in addition to the Chinese laborers who were killed, there were also three students who were killed. Two of them were witnessed by people being tied up and beaten by the Japanese self-defense corps with weapons until their heads were completely broken. The above facts were all committed by Japanese soldiers and police. It is clear that they were not accidental killings due to the chaos of the earthquake, and they all occurred after the day of the earthquake, and there is ample evidence. It is extremely difficult for Japanese officials to shirk responsibility. We have repeatedly sent notes to the Japanese ambassador and the Japanese Foreign Ministry, and sent lists of deaths, injuries, and damages, demanding that the murderers be punished and compensation be paid. However, they all made excuses to shirk responsibility and delayed the settlement of the case. It is estimated that 437 Chinese people were killed in this case, 46 were missing, 77 were injured, and property losses amounted to nearly 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japan's Failure to Purchase Qingdao Salt According to the Agreement</h3>
<p>According to the agreement on the details of resolving the Shandong pending cases, Japan should purchase a minimum of 100 million catties of Qingdao salt every year. However, since the establishment of the agreement, it has never complied with the quantity stipulated in the agreement. Even for the quantities that have been ordered, they are arbitrarily reduced midway. For example, 90 million catties were ordered in 1926 of the Republic of China, but 15 million catties were returned midway; 80 million catties were ordered in 1928, but 6 million catties were returned midway; 100 million catties were ordered in 1930, but 11.6 million catties were returned midway, causing the output and supply to lose their prepared standards. The agreement on the quantity and price of annual purchases is based on the unilateral opinion of the Japanese Monopoly Bureau, forcing the export managers to accept it, otherwise they are coerced by reducing the purchase quantity. Over the years, the export management companies have suffered significant losses. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly approved the Ministry of Finance's request to negotiate with the Japanese side to handle the matter in accordance with the agreement, but there has been no result.</p>
<h3>The First Korean Riot Case</h3>
<p>In December 1927 of the Republic of China, Koreans, using the excuse of newspaper reports of the Eastern Provinces cracking down on Korean residents, gathered crowds to riot, insulting overseas Chinese, looting property, and besieging the Incheon Consulate, spreading to almost the entire Korean Peninsula. A total of two overseas Chinese died and 48 were injured. Direct losses amounted to more than 29,000 Japanese yen, and indirect losses amounted to more than 90,000 yuan. The Japanese ambassador took the opportunity to file a protest first, attempting to shirk responsibility for negligence. Our side refuted it and sent the number of deaths and injuries to the Japanese ambassador, demanding compensation. The compensation for the losses was pending investigation.</p>
<p>A statement was reserved, and after repeated urging to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the matter was delayed with the excuse of transferring the investigation.</p>
<h3>Cases of Japanese or Taiwanese Nationals Growing Drugs Under Real Names</h3>
<p>Japanese or Taiwanese nationals use extraterritorial rights as a shield to openly open opium dens in China, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Dalian, Liaoning, Beiping, Qingdao, Jinan, Hankou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, etc., or sell drugs such as morphine, cocaine, and heroin under the guise of practicing medicine and selling medicine, refusing to be cracked down by local civil affairs offices. The Japanese consulate even protests searches. After being caught on the spot, negotiations are held with the Japanese side, but the Japanese side always makes excuses to perfunctorily deal with the matter, always harboring protection and never achieving substantial results. The most notable cases include the following: (1) The case of the Dalian Japanese Exchange transporting heroin to Tianjin, Shenyang, Shijiazhuang, Jilin, and other places. The chairman of the Dalian Commodity Exchange colluded with a large number of Japanese to secretly transport drugs such as morphine, opium, and heroin. In 1928 of the Republic of China, the value was about 1.38 million Japanese yen. Before 1928, those discovered amounted to a huge sum of more than 4 million. Dalian was the central agency, and the drugs were transported to Tianjin, Shenyang, Shijiazhuang, Jilin, and other places. Those discovered and reported by the Procuratorate included Shirakawa, Yamamatsu, Uekama, Yano, and others. The matter involved the Tokyo and Dalian authorities and was widely reported in Dalian newspapers as one of the so-called five major mystery cases in Dalian. (2) The case of Japanese people manufacturing drugs in Hankou and transporting them to the interior. In February 1929, Japanese people manufactured morphine in Hankou using German machinery and sold it secretly. It was reported by the representative of the International Anti-Smoking Association. (3) The case of more than 100 Japanese merchants secretly selling drugs in Jinan City. Eight Japanese merchants in Jinan, including Kahoku Yoko's Inokari Toraji, Kaishun Pharmacy's Omori Shigeru, Choron Yoko's Kinai, Tairon Company's Ikoma Kiyoaki, Tenchi Yoko's Tajima Sadakazu, Gisei Yoko's Kiyoko Banzhichi, Jinan Company's Nonaka Kiyoji, and Yamaura Yoko's Yamaura Torao, have been manufacturing and selling various drugs for a long time. In August 1929, the Shandong negotiator, with the approval of the Shandong Provincial Government and the Public Security Bureau, dispatched police officers to investigate one by one and seized a large number of drug manufacturing raw materials and equipment on the spot, especially white pills. Our side sent a letter to the Japanese consulate in Jinan separately to seal up, punish, confiscate, and destroy them, but the results of the handling were not replied to. Other Japanese people residing in Jinan, Jiaozhou, Huantai, Weixian, Yidu, and other places who secretly sold drugs were also numerous. A separate list was also sent to the Japanese ambassador, but no reply was received. (4) The case of Japanese police forcibly demanding the opium offender Cui Yuanjun. When the Yanji Public Security Bureau searched Cui Yuanjun's home in Juzijie for an opium case in September 1929, the Japanese police suddenly intervened, and the request for negotiation was ineffective. (5) The case of the Japanese ship Changfeng Maru privately transporting opium. The Japanese ship Changfeng Maru loaded opium to Shanghai in November 1929. When it arrived at the Wusongkou, the Wusong Fortress Commander invited various French groups to check the ship's fire hold on the spot and seized a total of 20 cases of opium, about 300 taels. It was transferred to the Shanghai Court for interrogation and handled by the Anti-Smoking Committee, which sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the Jiangsu negotiator to negotiate with the Japanese consul in Shanghai for crackdown, but the Japanese consul did not reply. (6) The case of the Liaoning Post Office seizing drugs privately transported by Japanese Ii Haruji. In November 1929, the Liaoning Post Office seized more than 120 packages of heroin sent from Hamburg, Germany, each package priced at 500 taels. The recipient was Japanese Ii Haruji. After repeated verification by the Postal Bureau and the Liaoning Provincial Government, it was confirmed that the Japanese merchant himself admitted that it was heroin of the same nature. The provincial government burned it publicly and ordered the special envoy to negotiate for punishment and reported it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to letters from the German and Japanese ministers to strictly crack down. (7) The case of Fuzhou Japanese national Liao Xianzhang sheltering opium and leading the crowd to rob offenders. In December 1929, when the detective team cracked the opium case in the Pan Guan Miao, Fuzhou Japanese national Liao Xianzhang led the crowd to fire guns and hold knives to rob the opium offenders and escaped after shooting and injuring detectives and investigators, and has not been arrested. (8) The case of the Japanese garrison in Shanhaiguan forcibly demanding drug traffickers. The Japanese garrison in Shanhaiguan repeatedly forcibly demanded the return of drug traffickers arrested in Changli County. Nine Japanese families in Changli County used the name of practicing medicine and selling medicine, but in fact, they specialized in selling drugs such as morphine, cocaine, and heroin. The county's prohibition was ineffective. Whenever they were caught, they were demanded by the Japanese garrison. The Anti-Smoking Committee sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that Changli was not a treaty port and Japanese people were not allowed to operate in the territory, and that their private sale of drugs was even more inappropriate. It requested the Japanese ambassador to inform the Japanese people not to stay in the county, but no reply was received. (9) The case of Japanese people selling drugs and military supplies in Gaomi County. Nine Japanese merchants in Gaomi County, including Kyoei Ten, Kanzawa, Maruyama, Mida, Takasho, Mishima, Kanaoka, and Kaneshiro, sold drugs and military supplies. The county government believed that Gaomi was not a treaty port and directly negotiated with them to ask them to leave the country, but they all refused strongly. The landlords repeatedly asked them to move out, but they also occupied the houses and refused to leave. Negotiations with the Japanese side also received no reply. (10) The case of more than 200 Japanese opium dens in Xiamen. Japanese Taiwanese residents Hong Rongbin, Zhou Falai, and Wang Nanbo and others opened opium dens and earth banks, defying the ban and delaying closure. In January 1930, there were still a total of 203 stores. The Siming County Government made a list and sent it to the Japanese consul in Xiamen for negotiation, but no results were obtained. There were even more in Fuzhou. (11) The case of the Qingdao Post Office detaining Japanese people privately transporting drugs. The Qingdao Japanese merchant Sanwa Shokai Yoshioka Yoko sold drugs and trafficked in cocaine and heroin from Switzerland and Hamburg, Germany, and sent them to Qingdao by registered mail through the post office, a total of 101 pieces. The Postal Inspection Office checked them, sent them to the Health Bureau for verification, confirmed that they were the above drugs, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan, which handed them over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request the Japanese ambassador to strictly crack down, but no reply was received. (12) The case of Fuzhou Japanese national shooting and killing opium smoker Lu Xi. In April 1930, Fuzhou Japanese national Xie Qingyun drew a pistol in a Taiwanese opium den in Houshou Baishe Temple and shot Lu Xi, a smoker, in the head. It went out from the back of the head, and he fell to the ground and died. The Fujian Provincial Government consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sent a letter to the Japanese ambassador to request assistance in the arrest, but he has not been arrested. (13) The case of the Shanghai Customs detaining opium. In November 1930, the Shanghai Customs seized 100 boxes of opium on the German ship Klaus Rickmers. The cargo list only stated opium and was transferred from Shanghai to Dalian. The Customs detained it for violating customs regulations and confiscated it. In May of this year, the Japanese chargé d'affaires sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating whether the fact that the Kwantung Government Monopoly Bureau ordered 100 boxes of opium from a Polish merchant and transported them to Dalian on the German ship Klaus Rickmers and were detained by the Shanghai Customs was true, and what was the reason. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs consulted with the Ministry of Finance to investigate and reply to the former situation, and then replied to the Japanese Embassy in Beiping. (14) The case of the Beiping Tadayoko selling military heroin. The Japanese merchant Arita Yoko in Xiaolisha Mao Hutong, Beiping, sold heroin. In December 1930, Xu Chunlin went to buy it. When he went out after buying it, he was caught by the police. Later, the Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau found that there were 177 cases of Japanese people selling heroin, morphine, and other drugs in Beiping that had been cracked over the years, and they had been sent to the Japanese Embassy or the court for handling. (15) The case of Japanese people selling drugs in Hankou. Japanese Taniguchi Katsujiro sold poisonous water guns and poisonous liquid medicine in Hankou. In April 1931, the Gendarmerie Battalion seized them and sent the medicine together with a letter to the Municipal Hospital for verification. It was an aniline compound that could endanger human life. It was also tested on dogs, and the dogs lost consciousness. The entire case was transferred to the Municipal Government for handling. A total of five poison guns and fifty bottles of poison water (to be continued)</p>
<h3>Valley Division's Artillery Shell Vehicle Explodes in Jinan</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: At about 2:00 PM today (9th), there was a sudden series of cannon explosions at Jinpu Railway Station, the sound shaking the roofs and tiles. Immediately, the military police tightened security around the station and prohibited pedestrians from passing. The cannon explosions stopped after half an hour and order was restored. It was found that a military artillery shell vehicle had exploded. The details of the incident are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Origin of the Artillery Shells: The Ordnance Department of the 22nd Division of Valley Liangmin, which was suppressing bandits in southern Shandong, needed a large number of mortars and bullets. It sent staff member Yang Xirong, along with four ordnance officers and four soldiers, to Jinan to apply for them. The Ordnance Department of the Third Route Army, following the order of Commander-in-Chief Han Fuju, issued 300 rounds of 75mm mortar shells, 400 rounds of 82mm mortar shells, 500 infantry bombs, and 61,000 bullets. They were loaded onto a vehicle at 11:00 AM today, a covered 京奉 Railway forty-ton railway car, which was attached to the south-bound passenger train number 7 of the 津浦 Railway. There were many passengers on the train who had already purchased tickets and boarded, waiting to depart south (according to the scheduled time, it should have departed at 2:30 PM), unexpectedly, a tragic incident occurred temporarily.</p>
<p>Details of the Explosion: At 2:15 PM, while loading the vehicle, coolie Liu Xiaoquan and others were momentarily careless. While carrying a box of artillery shells onto the vehicle, they used too much force, causing it to fall over inside the vehicle. With a loud bang, a box of mortar shells exploded instantly, and the remaining artillery shells and bombs were also affected in succession. The sound was as dense as a string of pearls. People at the station and passengers in the vehicle fled in all directions. The vehicle was also destroyed. The station master's office, ticket office, north and south waiting rooms, section chief's office, telegraph room, baggage room, railway post office, and engineering department buildings all had broken glass and tiles. Artillery shells also landed inside the South Telegraph Administration Bureau of the station. For a time, people were inevitably panicked.</p>
<p>Rescue and Security: At that time, Zhou Shilian, the transport director of the Third Route Army stationed at the station, urgently telegraphed reports to various locations. The Public Security Bureau's fire brigade water trucks all set out to the station to put out the fire. Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie, Garrison Commander Lei Taiping, and Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Kairu also rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. Lei dispatched the second battalion of the second regiment of the pistol brigade to temporarily impose martial law around the station, completely cutting off pedestrians from the main road to the north and Guanzha Camp to the south to prevent danger. At that time, a freight train was conveniently stopped at the station. Station Master Wang Jingbo, fearing that it would be ignited, risked his life to move it away. After the incident, Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie commended Wang for rescuing a train without avoiding danger and awarded him 200 yuan as an encouragement. By 4:30 PM, the explosions had stopped and the fire was extinguished. The security was lifted. Gun bullets and artillery shells were everywhere on the platform. The corpses of Song Huating, Liu Xiaoquan, Qiao Jide, and a child, who had been killed by the explosions, were still lying on the tracks, their flesh and blood blurred, a tragic sight.</p>
<p>Number of Casualties: After investigation, a total of four people were killed by the explosions, including Jinan Station coolies Qiao Jide and Liu Xiaoquan, and Song Huating, a major regimental adjunct of the Liang Guanying unit of the 25th Route Army, and an unnamed child, reportedly the daughter of an ordnance officer of the artillery regiment of the 29th Division. The Public Security Sub-bureau of the Southwest Township dispatched personnel to provide coffins for them. A total of eleven people were injured, including Yao Zhishan and Wei Zonghan, captains of the 64th regiment of the 22nd Division, Chen Wencai, a platoon leader of the machine gun company of the 3rd regiment of the 66th Brigade, and Wang Jiazhen, a nurse at the army hospital of the artillery regiment of the 29th Division, who were sent to the Third Route Army Hospital for treatment by Guan Shilian, the director of the Third Route Army's station office. Coolie Liu Ershang, Ruan Liangchen, Gao Wenguang, driver Guan Huaming, messenger Zhang Shaokang of the 25th Route Army, and cook Chen Caijun were all sent to the Jinpu Railway Hospital for treatment by Station Master Wang.</p>
<p>Authorities' Investigation: Yang Xirong, the staff member of the Ordnance Department of the 22nd Division who came to Jinan to apply for artillery shells, disappeared after the incident. Fu Zhengde, the director of the Ordnance Department of the 22nd Division, had already taken a train south from Jinan to his defense area today. Upon hearing that the bullet vehicle had caused an accident at Baimashan Station, he rushed back to Jinan to investigate the situation. Liu Kewen, the director of the Ordnance Department of the Third Route Army, also arrived at the scene of the accident to jointly investigate. (December 9th)</p>

It has recently been reported that the detainees have been released on bail one after another, causing public outcry. As it is the duty of this association, we cannot remain silent. Therefore, it was resolved at the tenth meeting of this association to send a letter to the executive committee at the same level, which will forward the letter to the Provincial Government, requesting a prompt and thorough investigation, and requesting the case to be transferred to the Supervisory Yuan to settle the accounts of the office. The corresponding record has been sent to you in a letter, hoping that you will investigate and handle it."</p>

They also telegraphed the National Government, the Central Party Department, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, stating that diplomacy was like this, national affairs were like this, and the violent Japanese were also like this. They could only urgently implore their government to lead the nation's long-fighting soldiers to expel the national traitors. The situation was critical and urgent.

<h3>Capture of Bandit Spy</h3>
<p>The seventh team of the Jiaxing County Merchants' Voluntary Security Corps found a suspicious person on the Tanghui Tiedong the night before last.

According to him, someone had arranged to wait here, preparing to rob a certain family on the opposite side of the Eastern Zha River, and also invited the God of Wealth. The team immediately reported to the corps headquarters and the public security organs dispatched a team to set up defenses. Sure enough, at midnight, a boat from Eastern Township came from the east. The team members ordered it to stop, but the boat sailed very quickly and escaped. Yesterday, the bandit spy was escorted to the corps headquarters by the team and sent to the Public Security Bureau, which transferred him to the court for investigation.</p>

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<h3>Sandboat Encountered Robbers</h3>
<p>The Xu Shuntai large sandboat can carry more than 200 tons and has more than 20 crew members. The captains are Chen Jinquan and Shi Fushou from Dinghai. On the 4th of this month, it loaded 2,500-600 pieces of passenger goods, redwood, and seafood worth more than 30,000 yuan from Fuzhou to Yong. Unexpectedly, at 5:00 PM on the 7th, while traveling through the Jinmen Island waters near Taizhou Bay, it was suddenly intercepted by three pirate ships. The captains tried their best to escape, but the pirates opened fire. The boat was hit by more than 20 bullets, and crew members Cao Asheng and Li Aquan were each hit by one bullet. They had no choice but to stop the boat. More than 100 pirates swarmed onto the boat to rob, searching the crew members for more than 200 yuan and robbing more than 900 pieces of redwood and seafood. They carried them over to the ship and first loaded one ship. The remaining two pirates still held the sandboat, forcing the captains to redeem the boat and all the crew members for 25,000 yuan. The captains pleaded repeatedly, but could not be exempted. At 5:00 AM on the 8th, a small sailboat passed by. The pirate leader ordered crew member He Yuesheng to take the sailboat to Yong to report and set a deadline to prepare the money for redemption within the year. Crew member He Yuesheng arrived in Zhenhai yesterday morning and reported the encounter to the cargo owners. In the afternoon, he transferred to a steamboat to Dinghai to report to the captains' families and find ways to rescue them.</p>

<h3>Yang Xingfo Resigns from the Special Education Committee Secretary-General</h3>
<p>Yang Xingfo's letter of resignation from his concurrent post as Secretary-General of the Special Education Committee reads: Mr. Jiemin, greetings. The Central Political Council established the Special Education Committee, and entrusted Quan with the position of committee member and secretary-general. During this time of national crisis, I should do my best to contribute my efforts. However, the responsibility of this committee is to reorganize education, so the position of secretary-general should be held by the official in charge of education. Since Quan took office at the Academia Sinica, he has not been involved in education or party affairs. The situation is already one of separation, and it is especially difficult to balance my energies. I earnestly request that my concurrent post as Secretary-General of the Special Education Committee be approved for resignation, and that Mr. Li Shuhua be recommended to take the position, in order to increase efficiency and unify authority. I am at your service with utmost urgency. Respectfully, I wish you well. December 11th.</p>

Therefore, we jointly telegraph your ministry, humbly requesting immediate dismissal and punishment to avoid further mistakes and blame.

<h3>Zheng Hongnian Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Students' Patriotic Movement is Premier's Legacy</p>
<p>University Students Discussing Politics Already Existed in the Autocratic Era</p>
<p>Due to the current national crisis, the universities in this city have petitioned in Nanjing twice. The students of Jinan University, elected by the Student Union, are in command. The Central Government inevitably suspects Zheng Hongnian. Yesterday, the Western newspapers reported that Nanjing ordered the Shanghai Garrison Command to secretly arrest Zheng. Whether this is true or not is unknown. The reporter went to visit Zheng to inquire about the situation. Zheng said that the enthusiastic performance of young students is actually a good phenomenon. However, education politicians speculate with vile intentions, stirring up trouble to curry favor, causing resentment among young people, and giving a major lesson to those who use young people as tools, which is deeply regrettable. I have always held the principle of running education for the sake of education, and I never use students as tools. I have repeatedly told this to my students. Precisely because I do not use students as tools, students are able to rise up automatically in times of crisis. This has many precedents in various countries. Even in our country, in the autocratic era, Li Ying exemplified the Imperial Academy in the Han Dynasty, and Chen Dong knelt before the palace gates to submit memorials in the Song Dynasty, refusing to be bowed by authority and unafraid of slander by petty men. The morale of the scholars was very high, and history praised them as men of integrity. University students discussing court politics is not new in history. This patriotic movement by students from various schools is also the legacy of Premier Sun to restore the inherent spirit of the nation. Currently, it is the preliminary stage of expressing the restoration of the national spirit. The actions and steps of the students may not be consistent. This is a phenomenon that should occur during a period of transition. Guiding the situation to promote strengths and correct shortcomings is what those of us who run education should strive for. As for the pure and patriotic actions of our school's students, it is not unreasonable to say that it is due to my usual effective education. It is truly an expression of good educational results, and I personally feel very comforted. China will not perish because of this. Confucius said, "If, on examination, I find that I am upright, what is there to worry about? What is there to fear?" I repeat these words to myself three times a day.</p>
<h3>Provisional General Meeting of the University Federation</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Secondary School Students Anti-Japanese Joint Association</h3>
<p>丨Emergency Delegate Meeting to be Held Today丨</p>
<p>9:00 AM at Qingxin Middle School</p>
<p>The Shanghai Secondary School Students Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association has resolved through its eighth provisional delegate meeting to hold a provisional emergency delegate meeting today (the 13th) at 9:00 AM at Qingfan Middle School on Lujiabang Road to discuss important matters. A circular has already been sent to various schools, requesting them to send two delegates to attend on time.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Decides to Add Chinese Schools</h3>
<p>(Shenshi News Agency) Regarding the addition of Chinese schools in the Shanghai Municipal Council's education plan, at the meeting of the Education Committee on December 2nd, the chairman stated that according to the council's established plan, two new schools should be added each year. However, only one school was established in 1931. The Director of Public Works responded that the key to this matter lies in finding suitable school sites. The Education Committee should determine the required number of sites so that the Public Works Department can investigate and design. Although two schools could not be established this year, the council has leased two sites for use.</p>
<p>The chairman then read a letter from the Chinese members, stating that because two primary schools and one girls' secondary school may not be added next year, they suggested temporarily renting houses to establish two coeducational primary schools, and allocating part of the funds originally designated for building permanent school sites to the 1932 budget, so that construction could begin in 1932 and be completed in 1933. The chairman also stated that the council's education plan must be implemented as much as possible in the initial years.</p>
<p>One member stated that since the committee plans to build as many as sixteen new schools, the distance between the schools may be very far. The Director of Public Works responded that he intended to find a site in the industrial area of the Western District, but this would also depend on the financial situation. The chairman then proposed that the Director of Public Works immediately begin investigating which buildings could be rented in order to add two Chinese primary schools in 1932. This proposal was passed.</p>
<p>One member stated that he did not oppose the temporary measure of renting houses to establish schools, but he should solemnly declare that the committee was forced to do so. Building permanent school buildings is extremely important, so he strongly supported finding about six plots of land as permanent primary school sites, and paying special attention to the Western District. After an investigation report is received, funds will be allocated in the 1932 budget to purchase this land.</p>
<p>The Director of Finance then mentioned the need to save expenses, but the general opinion was that the Education Department's position was different from other departments. Since the council had decided to change its education policy and establish more schools for the Chinese, it would be a breach of faith to the Chinese residents if this policy were violated.</p>
<p>One member then proposed a compromise, which was to find one or more plots of land in the Eastern District to build temporary school buildings in order to avoid the huge rent of renting houses. The consensus was that if school buildings could not be rented at a reasonable price, this proposal could also be considered for reference.</p>
<h3>Patriotic Activity Achievement Competition Speech Finals Held Today</h3>

<h3>Jinan and Donghua Struggle Bitterly in Bone-Chilling Wind to a Draw</h3>
<p>A Score of Zero to Zero</p>
<p>Grade A Football Match</p>
<p>The weather suddenly turned cold, and the wind was bone-chilling. The Donghua and Jinan football teams still held the Grade A treasure at the China Baseball Field yesterday. After 90 minutes of fierce battle, the result was a score of zero to zero, with neither side scoring. Given the strength of Donghua and Jinan, and their first encounter, three or four thousand people still braved the cold to watch, shivering but unyielding.</p>
<p>Donghua Lineup</p>
<p>Chen Pu, Qian Jingyong</p>
<p>Li Ning, Chen Hongguang</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Tu Kaiyuan, Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>Guan Xun'an, Li Yichen</p>
<p>Jin Yuancan, Chen Yutian</p>
<p>Jinan Lineup</p>
<p>Liang Shutang, Liu Zukan</p>
<p>Qiu Dongyan, Yang Baomiao</p>
<p>Chen Buzhang, Zhuang Shihong, Chen Zhenhe</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou, Jiang Zongmian</p>
<p>Chen Fuzhong, Mei Hongbao</p>
<p>The Generals on Both Sides are Refreshed</p>
<p>The generals on both sides have undergone changes, especially Jinan. The injured are injured, and the sick are sick. The main generals Jiang Shanjing and Luo Haiguang, and the goalkeeper Wen Dingxin, did not play. Even Qiu Dongyan, a key player in the forward line, was reassigned to the defense. Donghua was also missing the central forward Dai, who had a mission of command, and Chen Jiaqiu was promoted to replace him.</p>
<p>Performance in the Wind is Difficult</p>
<p>The north wind roared, blowing against faces and swirling people around. It was unbearable to be in the cold, let alone kick against the wind. When Donghua first faced the wind, the ball could not be kicked out, and the activity changed as usual. Kicking the ball was also not as desired, and the performance was not worth mentioning. The Donghua defense is not worth mentioning. The central defense line was very good yesterday, the new Jin, the veteran Chen, and the midfielder Tu were all very satisfactory. Among the forwards, Qian Jingyong was very active. Feng Yunyou in Jinan was heavily burdened in the back, defending all sides. Qiu Dongyan was also quite good, showing that he could attack and defend. The forward Xiao Heitan was monitored by others, so his activities were not often seen.</p>
<p>Jinan's Momentum Was Terrifying</p>
<p>Referee Li Nuosi, Donghua kicked off, and Jinan took advantage of the wind to launch a large-scale invasion. Chen Fuzhong passed to Mei Hongbao, who rushed along the side, creating a corner kick. Mei Hongbao's corner kick was excellent, but Yang Baomiao failed to kick it well, which was a pity. Only two minutes into the game, Donghua got the ball, Chen Pu and Qian Jingyong also rushed forward, passing to Chen Yutian. The shot was very light, and Chen Buzhang caught it and kicked it out. Jinan then led the team to attack again. Liang Shutang shot from more than 30 yards away, and Zhou Xianyan kicked it out smoothly. Both were surrounded and attacked, and the head was actually kicked, fortunately without serious harm. The first half ended like this.</p>
<p>Injustice for Jiaqiu Who Did Not Turn Against His Team</p>
<p>Some people blamed Chen Jiaqiu for Donghua's repeated failures to score, suspecting that since Chen was originally from Jinan, replacing the center forward was suspicious. Therefore, some called Jiaqiu a traitor. In fact, it was an injustice. Please look at the facts. After Donghua changed sides, its momentum increased sharply, and it also launched attacks. Unfortunately, the two free kicks 20 yards in front of the goal were not scored, one by Li Yichen and one by Ma Kaiyuan. Suddenly, the reporter's incident was discovered. Chen Jiaqiu dribbled the ball, charging straight on horseback, breaking through three levels in a row, and shooting fiercely at the goal. It was thought that it would go in, but the ball happened to hit Chen Buzhang's hand and was blocked. How did Jiaqiu turn against the team? After another 20 minutes of hard fighting, the final score was 0-0.</p>

<h3>Recollections of the Tortoiseshell Beam</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>In our nation's art circles, those painters and calligraphers who have frequent interactions with famous figures from the East and are highly regarded in that country include Qian Shoutie, Wang Yiting, Ma Qizhou, Sun Xueni, and Ma Mengrong. Wang earns about ten thousand taels of silver annually from Japanese commissions, and people in Japan consider it an honor to possess even a small piece of his work. Since the Japanese army occupied Liaoning and Jilin, Wang has resigned from his position as a comprador for Japanese companies to show his resolve. Qian Shoutie's rustic calligraphy and paintings are highly valued by the Japanese, but Qian, being of a proud nature, rarely grants requests. Recently, he refused a request from the Japanese and, along with Sun Xueni, Ma Mengrong, Ma Qizhou, and others, is assisting Madam He Xiangning in a charity art exhibition to aid in national salvation. They are soliciting paintings and running around appealing to people, tears flowing as they speak, demonstrating that their patriotic fervor has reached a boiling point. Ma Mengrong painted "Strange Fish" and two paintings titled "Even a Barbarian Is Not as Good as a Crab," adding long, impassioned poems that satirize the abilities of the Japanese pirates. Those who saw them were moved to smash their spitoons in anger. Sun Xueni used to have dealings with Japanese merchants, but since the Northeast Incident, he has severed all business ties with them. He He Tianjian inscribed a set of anti-Japanese calendars and distributed them to his friends. The paintings were exquisitely rendered by his talented student, Tian Qingquan. He Tianjian's inscriptions were profound in thought and expression, serving as lasting memorials. Most remarkably, Ma Qizhou engaged in poetic exchanges with the Japanese poet Tanaka Keinan, sending poems back and forth through the postal system. Last month, Tanaka sent another poem to Ma, to which Ma replied with a letter of severing ties, including the lines, "With national enmity forged, national humiliation must not be forgotten. Let us sever ties from this day forth. We shall meet amidst gunfire and bullets. Do not say that there is no one left in Qin." Currently, he is launching the "Four Ma Support Ma Art Exhibition" with Ma Wanli, Ma Mengrong, and Ma Gongyu to sell paintings to support military expenses, which has been lauded by those who have heard of it.</p>

<h3>Opening Remarks of a Historical Drama</h3>
<p>Shakespeare said, "The world is a stage..." Humanity is staging an unprecedented historical drama, and both those who are too lazy to move and those who are happy to move are characters in the play. I cannot write a script, so let a clown sing a few opening lines:</p>
<p>"I too once made revolution,</p>
<p>Now too lazy to move, afraid of others moving.</p>
<p>Should anyone dare to move,</p>
<p>I will denounce them as reactionaries!"</p>

<p>(3) Freedom is directing one's own actions with one's own will. Individual freedom is directing one's own actions with one's own individual will. Group freedom is directing the group's actions with the group's own will.</p>
<h3>Records of Customs and Scenery of Longjiang by Ma Shichi</h3>
<p>My friend, Mr. Wang Beiming, is renowned in the legal field and particularly enthusiastic about the anti-Japanese cause. The "Five-Man National Salvation Group" was initiated by him. Recently, he returned from the Shanghai Special District Court and visited me by car. We talked late into the night, and he told me about the customs and scenery of Longjiang, giving me a general idea. He had served in the Heilongjiang government. Alas, with Ban Dingyuan not appearing, and Qi Shaobao deceased, I looked out at our rivers and mountains, half of which have fallen into foreign hands. I record this article, my ink mixed with tears, unable to bear the feeling of national loss.</p>
<p>Heilongjiang was known as North Fuyu and the land of the various Wuji tribes during the Northern Wei Dynasty. During the Tang Dynasty, the Shiwei and Mohe tribes arose there. When the Manchus entered the Pass, they built cities in Heilongjiang and established generals and commanders-in-chief to guard them. In the late Qing Dynasty, the generals were dismissed, and governors were appointed. Prefectures, departments, and counties were established, and the provincial government was set up in Qiqihar (transliteration), known as Longjiang Prefecture. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the government was organized into counties, but Qiqihar remained the provincial capital.</p>
<p>Qiqihar is a small place, with city walls facing each other. One can see the west gate from the east gate. The city is narrow and cramped, with camels and mule carts for transportation. Outside the city, there are fertile fields and abundant livestock. The people are hardworking and accustomed to farming, unlike the extravagance and effeminacy of the South. However, their farming methods are conservative and unchanging. Seeds are scattered freely in the fields, without irrigation or mounds. When it is time to harvest, the dregs are used for food, while the best grains are sold overseas. Their daily sustenance consists of wheat, made into a flour mixed with soil, coarse and black as charcoal, seasoned with salt, so bitter that it is almost impossible to swallow. But the people of Heilongjiang regard it as a rare delicacy. How influential are customs!</p>
<p>The land of Heilongjiang is extremely cold. The river freezes in August and does not thaw for eight months. Rainfall is scarce. In autumn, the rain and dew turn to ice and snow. Mules and horses trample it, leaving manure on the snowy ground that freezes and does not melt, causing hardship for travelers. The outskirts are unbearably cold. Sometimes, tears and snot freeze, making it difficult to open one's eyes. Lambskin is the only way to keep warm in Heilongjiang. A robe requires only ten or so sheep. However, the style of clothing is strange, with the wool facing outward and lined with coarse cloth. The leather boots and face covers are also made this way. I do not know what purpose this serves. The houses are airtight and free from moisture. In winter, residents build heated brick beds (kangs) to keep warm. Fuel is scarce, so they use dried mule and horse manure. The kang is fitted with a pipe that vents outside, preventing foul odors. Entering a home is like returning to spring in a millet field.</p>
<p>Plants sprout in early summer and wither in early autumn. The period of growth is very short. Watermelons are produced in July and must be eaten wrapped in cotton. In the height of summer, June is best for wearing light clothing, but traveling in the suburbs in the early morning or late evening is still chilly.</p>
<p>The climate of Heilongjiang is unique, and the transition from morning to evening is almost the opposite of that in the South. In spring and summer, the days are short and the nights are long. In autumn, the opposite is true. Near the winter months, it is dark most of the time, usually by 9:30.</p>
<p>The main agricultural products are soybeans and wheat, followed by vegetables such as lettuce and radishes. The soybean crop has been particularly abundant in recent years. However, transporting it to the interior is very expensive, and taxes are heavy, leading to a loss. As a result, there is overproduction, and some is destroyed and used as fuel, which is a great pity. I hope that those who advocate promoting domestic products will consider this.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang also said that the northeastern provinces are often referred to as "barren land and poor people." In reality, the people are indeed poor, but the land is not barren. If cultivation can be improved, animal husbandry diligently practiced, mineral resources developed, and transportation improved, prosperity can be achieved in less than ten years, and production can be sufficient for the entire country. This is what the Japanese invaders seek day and night, seizing by trickery and force. How can we, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, inherit such mountains and rivers and abandon them to our descendants? How can our descendants fear difficulty and live in ease, handing them over under the doctrine of non-resistance?</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of General Li Fangchen</h3>
<p>— Shi Lei'an</p>
<p>General Li Jinglin, director of the Central Guoshu Academy and a veteran general of the Northern Warlords, recently passed away from rectal bleeding. When the news arrived, people at home and abroad, whether they knew him or not, mourned his death. In particular, Li's old friends and subordinates cried until they lost their voices.</p>
<p>Li, named Fangchen, was from Zaoqiang, Hebei Province. He was forty-seven years old. He came from a poor family and lost his father early. When he came of age, he had great ambitions. He studied in Japan and graduated from the Military Academy. After returning to China, he rose rapidly from battalion commander to prominent positions. Marshal Zhang Zuolin valued him most and repeatedly gave him important tasks, such as military commander, superintendent, and commander-in-chief. Li governed his troops with strictness, comparable to Marquis Wen. The people of the Northeast still praise him today.</p>
<p>Many military men in our country possess vast wealth, but Li alone did not engage in production. After the Northern Expedition, he severed all ties with fame and fortune. The authorities, knowing his ability, wanted to station him in a certain area, but Li firmly declined. Instead, he took up the post of director of the Central Guoshu Academy, where he made many plans for the development of martial arts. His contribution to promoting national essence and strengthening the people cannot be denied.</p>
<p>In his later years, Li indulged in Chan Buddhism and had thoughts of transcending the world. One day, he said to his wife, "I am old and have wasted many years, serving in the military for many years. I am ashamed to have achieved nothing for the people. Now that our children have grown up and can support themselves, how can I abandon the mortal world and escape like Wu Ziyu to the outside world?" After speaking, he looked pensive. His calligraphy was elegant and strong, similar to that of Yu Shinan. I once saw a couplet he wrote for He Jiajun: "The horse neighs in the stable like Zhi Dun; the pond raises geese like Wang Xizhi." The brushstrokes were powerful, revealing a heroic spirit. According to Li's staff, the general lived a frugal life and enjoyed reading and swordsmanship. He was naturally gifted with a strong physique. However, in recent years, he suffered from rheumatism from years of campaigning, and his hands and feet often felt sore and numb. The doctor advised him to take beef juice regularly to dispel the disease and strengthen his body. Li then ordered several dozen bottles of Colworth's beef juice from the market. It proved to be remarkably effective.</p>
<h3>A Short Record of Strange Fish</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Fish swim in water and enjoy themselves. The Buddhist term "water shuttle flower" is derived from this. There are many kinds of fish, but only one-tenth of them are used for cooking. Here, I record strange fish I have heard of and seen in books, hoping to amuse readers.</p>
<p>Yunnan has crystal fish. The fish's intestines and stomach are translucent, allowing one to see clearly inside.</p>
<p>Flying fish, also known as Wenyao fish, are found along the coast of the United States. They are one and a half to one and a half feet long, with a dark blue back and a white belly. The scales are round, large, and easily shed. They swim in schools on the surface of the sea. The pectoral fins are large, sometimes larger than the body, and are used as wings to fly over the water surface, reaching a height of six or seven feet.</p>
<p>The Zhuhuai River contains the Yiyu fish. It has the body of a fish and the head of a dog.</p>
<h3>Records of Things Seen and Heard in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>Yellow Bud Cabbage</p>
<p>The north has early frosts and deep cold, making it suitable to eat vegetables that can't be had during winter. Yet, it is actually the contrary. Yellow bud cabbage is the product of a rich frost that makes it both succulent and delicious. In the spring, it becomes bland and tasteless. This is called frost cabbage. With the stove fire lit, a bowl of cooked vegetables and a soup accompaniment will be an additional treat. No meat flavor is needed. It can be eaten daily without boredom, so it is a superior vegetable. If pickled in a jar with salt, weighed down with a stone, and frozen, it crunches like ice. This must be the salt pickles Su Dongpo enjoyed after drinking. In the past, the Manchus mixed rare fruits and grains into porridge on the eighth day of the twelfth month, called Laba porridge. Friends exchanged gifts, with these pickles being the most prized. The quality of the vegetable can predict a family's prosperity. In the cold season, northern people burn coal balls for heating. In poor homes, the windows are small and tightly sealed. When the coal fire is dying, it produces poisonous fumes. People sleep unaware and suffocate to death. In the past, there was no western medicine for emergency treatment. Drinking pickle juice was the only way to revive them. All families had it. In recent years, western-style stoves are used. Even if coal balls are still used, people know to move the dying fire outside before going to bed. The police also have medicines and give advice. This problem is becoming rare. Those who are new to the northern capital should inquire and be careful. There are also greenhouses in the north where vegetables can be grown artificially. Thus, in the severe cold of ice and snow, if one wants to eat cucumbers, one can have them immediately, but the price is expensive.</p>
<p>The Sound of Selling Ice</p>
<p>Shu Wei's Bingshuizhai Collection has a poem about sending to the family in Beijing: "Lilacs and peonies have all bloomed, apricots and cherries are gradually becoming cheaper. The sound of golden shears just stopped the copper bowl rings, the sound of selling flowers has turned to the sound of selling ice." This poem vividly describes the scenery of summer. Ice sellers make sounds by hitting two copper bowls together. It's convenient and clear. It can be found in many notes by the people of Ming and Qing. This tradition is very old. Now, not only ice sellers but also dessert sellers do this. Ice for sale in the northern capital is mostly stored in the Ten Temples Sea. In winter, ice is chiseled out of the sea in large blocks and stored in caves. They're released and sold in the summer of the following year. Everyone, rich or poor, uses them freely. The policy of storing and distributing ice was very important in ancient times. The previous dynasty still had a custom of giving ice in April to reduce the troubles of the hot weather, which is like following the ancient way. Northern people serve ice trays first at summer banquets, with fruit mixed in to eat. Poor people may just gnaw on ice instead of drinking, which easily leads to abdominal diseases. It's better to prohibit it.</p>
<p>Its sound is like a baby's. Eating it will drive you crazy.</p>
<p>Leaf fish have tails that branch out like leaves and patterns on their heads. They are found in the Philippines. Eel fish are very beautiful, several feet long, and winding like snakes. It is said that being bitten causes deafness. Lion fish, despite the name, are shaped like horses but without hooves. Zebra fish have zebra-like spots and delicious meat for cooking. Crab-foot fish have fins shaped like sticks, very much like crab feet, and are said to be very poisonous, capable of killing people. All are displayed in the Philippines' aquarium.</p>
<p>Black dolphins are beasts with fish tails and are found in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>In the Japanese sea, there are fish that are no different from humans, but bald-headed and with tails, called sea monks.</p>
<p>Mud monkeys, also known as sea sharks, are round and long with round heads and protruding eyes. The gill covers have wart-like growths. Their backs are dark blue and their bellies are white. There are four black round spots on both sides. The tail is fan-shaped. They are two or three inches long and live in estuaries where fresh and saltwater mix. The gills can store water and the pectoral fins can crawl. They often crawl on the tidal sands and can jump on land as easily as monkeys, hence the name. They are also called mudskippers, which is the same name as gobies.</p>
<p>Oily fish, also known as weasel fish, are very flat and short, with wide heads that taper to the tail. The upper jaw is longer than the lower jaw. There are several pairs of whiskers next to the mouth. There are two pairs of whip-like bodies on the throat, transformed from the pelvic fins. The dorsal, anal, and caudal fins are connected. The body is covered with smooth, elliptical comb-like scales. The back is dark brown and the belly is blue. The eyes and scales are the color of weasels. They are eight or nine inches to one foot three or four inches long and are found in the Pacific Ocean, living in rocky areas near the coast.</p>
<p>Sailfish are up to thirteen or fourteen feet long and live in the open ocean. They like to swim in the upper layers of the water and often use their sword-like upper jaw to stab other fish or dig into the bottom of ships and sand. The meat is light red and tastes good. They are distributed in the Pacific Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The Atlantic Ocean also produces them. They are also called rudder fins or feather fish.</p>
<p>Electric light fish live along the coast of the United States. These fish can emit light at night, which is beneficial for navigation, no less than a lighthouse.</p>
<p>Publishing News: The Medical Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, recognizing the rampant flames of the enemy and the urgent need for the people to be prepared with knowledge of defense against poisonous gases, has compiled and printed a book entitled "Essentials of Chemical Warfare." In addition to detailing the chemical properties of various poisonous gases, the methods of making poisonous gases, and the symptoms and treatments for victims of poisonous gases, the contents also focus on general protection methods and urban protection methods. The descriptions of the release of poisonous gases and aerial attacks are particularly realistic. Each volunteer team, each organization, each school, and people from all walks of life must have a copy in order to be prepared. The entire book is about 200 pages with more than ten illustrations. It is sold cheaply for six jiao, to promote widespread awareness (add seven jiao for postage).</p>

<h3>Sharing the Enemy (9)</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Like-Minded and United in Purpose</p>
<p>From then on, he also saw through Mei Guo's character and didn't like to waste words with him. Fortunately, Zhong Shu would come to chat from time to time and accompany him on outings nearby. Mei Guo had learned that Hua Naiqiang was a pauper and gradually became cold towards him. After two weeks, he couldn't bear it any longer. So, he said goodbye to Zhong Shu and returned to school first. Later, Zhong Shu came to the school, and the two of them talked about Zhong Shu's father in their spare time. Zhong Shu also admitted that her father was a warlord and that their views were not aligned. Hua Naiqiang said to Zhong Shu, "I am simply dissatisfied with your father's behavior. I don't listen to a word he says. Please don't be offended. I shouldn't be saying bad things about your father in front of you. The most embarrassing thing was that scene of beating the concubine the other day, which made me feel uneasy. If it weren't for your father, I would definitely..." Hua Naiqiang paused here and said, "Then again, those big shots who hold military power and sit high in the government are self-important and tyrannical. How many of them are clean and self-respecting, working for the country and the people? The world is full of them. It's not just your father." He sighed. Zhong Shu blushed and said, "Isn't that so? The way things are, how can China be good? Seeing my father's behavior makes me very ashamed. I have repeatedly advised him, but he refuses to listen and says I shouldn't meddle in his affairs." Hua Naiqiang said, "This is a matter of individual nature and cannot be generalized. It is rare to find someone like you, Madam, who is so insightful and patriotic." Zhong Shu smiled shyly again. From then on, Hua Naiqiang knew that Zhong Shu's father was such a person and felt sorry for her. It was also unfortunate to be born into such a powerful family. The day before the incident happened, the two of them were sitting on the grass in the west corner of the exercise field after practice, talking. The golden sunset shone on a large elm tree behind them. The cool breeze blew Zhong Shu's short hair around her ears. Zhong Shu rubbed her hands and said to Hua Naiqiang, "Our country's diplomacy is so slow. It has been so long since the Wanbaoshan Massacre, but there is still no solution. Is it true that weak countries have no diplomacy? Are our people just going to be slaughtered by others? The ignorant Koreans don't know the pain of losing their country and are willing to be used by others. They are both pitiful and hateful." Hua Naiqiang said, "This is the development of the Sun Country's Korean immigrant promotion and protection policy. They move Korean people to our country to open up land for them. When the time comes, they use them for military actions or large-scale conflicts, and then use the pretext of suppression to help them carry out their ambitions. They have coveted our borders for a long time. For decades, they have been doing it every day. I think this riot is just a test. There are more ruthless means to come."</p>

<p>Finally, the total settlement rose about thirteen taels. Initially, although the silver market rose, it was limited. Because the United States had sales again, people expected it to rise, so it opened high. Afterwards, the situation in foreign markets was very different, being loose overseas but tight domestically. The trades on the surface were different, so the price fluctuated around 660 taels. At noon, it suddenly showed a lively image because large households were vying to buy and the exchange rate was particularly strong, soaring above 670 taels. Later, because the market was closed for the weekend, it was found that there had been a major change in the market during the week. The highest price was 708 taels and the lowest price was 649 taels. The total drop on Saturday was just over 31 taels. The situation of yesterday's market is recorded in detail below.</p>
<p>Major changes in the market in the afternoon: it rose eight taels and seven qian from the early opening to 665.5 taels. The big silver bars rose another quarter, the silver price rose one-half, and private telegrams rose 8.75 points. However, the local situation was good and it was not affected. There were two and a half taels of ups and downs. Only Tong Taichang, Hengxing, and retail customers sold, and it dropped slightly, totaling only 59 taels. Soon, the exchange rate was firm as soon as it was traded. Banks bought US$33.50 to 4375, and British gold was transacted at 11 pence 9375. HSBC sold 8125. In addition, Yuanxing, Yongcui, Changyong, and the Dalian gang bought in, so the price rose steadily. When the British gold was announced, it was 68 taels, but the listed price increased by 25 points, and the US dollar was half a yuan. It fell back to 65 or 6 taels. At this time, the sellers were very diligent, and one-month British gold was available in the range of 875, and it dropped to 59.5 taels in just two or three minutes. After that, it suddenly turned upwards. Cuichang, Yonghong, Kangyong, Yuanxing, Yongzhifeng, Yongyuanmao, Yongdakang, etc. were all vying to buy, so it rose six taels at once to 65.8 qian at 10:00. Wheat firms and others absorbed US$33.50 for March, transacted at 4375. Later, Chengfeng, Yonghan, Hengyuan, Dayong, and Tianfeng sold out, causing the price to collapse and decline by nine taels, which was 57 taels at 10:30. As for the US dollar, it was added to 5625, and British gold was 875. The future trend was stable and firm, revealing a rising trend. Da Xingyong, Yuan Xingyong, Yifengyong, Yongfuyu Zhifengyong, and the material arbitrage made great efforts to drag it in, especially the US dollar was quite tight, from 375 to 25, and then only 33 yuan was absorbed, soaring by more than 13 taels. The price hovered between one and two taels until 11:45, which was 70 taels and 8 qian. At this time, the Dalian gang and Tong Taichang and others took the stage to sell out, so they had to suppress a little more than three taels to 67.5 taels. Yuanmaoyong, Zhifengyong, Neixing, and Hengxing still had a strong desire to buy. Then it closed at 69.5 taels and continued to trade to 71 or 2 taels. Compared to the day before yesterday (according to the listed price), it rose by 12 taels and 7 qian. According to the listed price, the maximum price in half a day was 670 taels and 08 qian, and the minimum price was 657 taels, with a fluctuation of 13 taels and 8 qian. The material price in the morning market was 64 taels, and it closed at 69.5 taels in the afternoon. The price was changed to 739 taels, with a discount of 70 to 80 taels, and closed at 70 taels in the afternoon. The accounting was 66 taels, 70 taels, the water replenishment was 66 taels, and the naked silver was increased by 6.5 taels.</p>
<p>Trading is not lonely: According to the table statistics, Da Xingyong, Yuan Xingyong, Yi Fengyong, Wanxing, Bingxing, Zhifengyong, Cuichangyong, Yuanmaoyong, Fuyu, Fuchang, Dakang, Hongkangyong, and Wu all entered. Tong Taichang, Cheng Fengyong, Dadecheng, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Tian Fengyong, Qianchangxiang, and Hanhang all exited. Yuankangxiang, Hengchangyong, Hengyu, Yuanchun, and Tongfu had some deposits and withdrawals. Hengxing first exited and then entered, but the number was very small.

Chinese merchants received 1.89 million in remittances, foreign merchants received over 1.4 million in remittances, and various goods, taxes, and miscellaneous payments received over 1.1 million. Inflow to warehouses was 400,000, and outflow was 300,000. Silver shops received over 34.4 million in remittances, clearinghouse accounts received over 3.3 million, various remittance routes received over 400,000, and cash received 2-300,000.

<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Demobilization 20 Bonds Fall by $1.50</p>
<p>Other Small Amounts Vary from Several Cents to $1</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was quiet, with only sporadic transactions in each bond. Spot trading was not deserted in the morning, with many types of bonds being traded. However, in the afternoon, only the Consolidated Tax 19 Bonds and Customs Bonds saw some transactions. The trend for each bond continued to weaken compared to the previous day, but the trend was quite peaceful, probably because both buyers and sellers were clear, and there were no large transactions in the market. Looking at the changes in each bond price, the market opened weak in the morning, and the price continued to fall from the previous day. Although the trend was particularly slow, each transaction gradually declined, and the decline did not weaken. As a result, each bond continued to fall compared to the previous day. Futures, such as the Demobilization 20 Bonds, fell by $1.50, while smaller amounts varied from several cents to $1. Spot prices also fell significantly. Only the Small Note 19 Customs Bonds rose by $1.70 compared to the end of last month. The continued decline in bond prices is due to the hasty conclusion of the League of Nations with little achievement, and the lack of progress in Sino-Japanese diplomacy, leading to a pessimistic outlook on the future situation. However, the future of the bond market remains very chaotic, and the trend is still difficult to determine. The total spot transactions for the day amounted to $48,000, futures transactions amounted to over $2.2 million in the morning and $1.7 million in the afternoon, totaling $3.95 million.</p>

<h3>Yarn, Cotton Yarn Market Sees Short Covering in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon, but the situation was very scattered and lacked any sign of recovery. Transactions in the market felt increasingly lacking, and as the end of the year approached, there was a sense of closure. Business in spot yarn on the market has stalled due to the poor situation.</p>
<p>Man-made Fiber Weak in the Morning, Strong in the Afternoon: The man-made fiber market opened weak in the morning due to the rise in American cotton and the fall in Indian cotton, resulting in a slight drop of 0.1-0.2 cents for each month. In the afternoon, some short positions were covered, and each month rose by 0.4-0.5-0.8-0.9 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 8,200 bales. It was found that 1,150 bales were sold by Tai Hing, 600 bales by Yuan Tai, and 600 bales by Yi Chang, while 1,550 bales were purchased by Guang Feng and 400 bales by Yi Yu. The closing prices are recorded below. Man-made Fiber Closing Prices, Rise/Fall, Balance</p>
<p>December 15.14 - Down 0.01 - 33,000 - March 15.36 - Up 0.07 - 70,900</p>
<p>January 15.19 - Up 0.04 - 60,200 - April 15.37 - Up 0.09 - 54,400</p>
<p>February 15.28 - Up 0.07 - 69,900 - May 15.37 - Up 0.09 - 31,100</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Stagnant: Spot yarn sales are very stagnant. It was found that only 450 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the day, with 35 bales by colleagues. Prices were flat. Among the various groups, 120 bales were purchased by the mainland, 10 bales by Ningbo, 70 bales by Guangdong, 200 bales by Sichuan, and 10 bales by Gaoyang.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Stable</h3>
<p>The cotton market was calm. Although American cotton rose, Indian cotton trended down, leading to stability in the market. However, the actual situation is unlikely to be good, as the domestic harvest is poor, sources from various regions are dwindling, and the base is very dry. There are fewer new sellers, but most are looking at the downside. Only the Hubei group is long, holding tight.</p>
<p>Hubei Cotton Slightly Better: Hubei cotton was slightly better in the morning market because American cotton rose and gold prices trended up, leading to a decrease in sellers. Each month rose slightly by 0.05-0.1 cents. In the afternoon, it rose another 0.1-0.15 cents. Total transaction volume for the day was 18,900 dan. It was found that 1,200 dan were sold by Heng Chang, 900 dan by Gong Zou, and 900 dan by Rui Yuan, while 2,200 dan were purchased by Chang Ji, 1,100 dan by Ming De, and 1,800 dan by Chang Feng. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>Continued Demand for Foreign Cotton: Transactions in spot cotton remained quiet, but various foreign cotton factories still had inventory entering. 191 bales of Yao cotton arrived.</p>
<p>Sakellaridis Mitter Cotton: 33.70 Shenxin Entered 3,000 Pieces, Shipped in February to the Factory</p>

<h3>American Cotton Shows Signs of Recovery</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to pressure from sellers, but then became firm due to purchases by Japanese merchants and short covering. Futures rose by 0.11-0.16 pounds, and spot rose by 0.15 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 3 points, and spot fell by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was weak, with Pingle falling by 11 rupees, Omu La falling by 8 rupees, and Bai Luoxi falling by 6 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (dated the 11th).</p>

<h3>American Cotton Showed No Improvement Last Week</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 11th reported on the cotton market for the week, stating that the government's estimated report on cotton harvest quantities on Tuesday did not increase significantly, being about 300,000 bales less than the public expected. This triggered short covering, but when prices rose by 0.10-0.15 pounds, there were fewer buyers, so the market soon turned loose. Grains and securities showed no improvement, and after the report, cotton prices were still disappointing, leading to more aggressive speculative selling at present, and old long positions were also being liquidated. There is still rain in the South, and the movement of new cotton is hindered, which may also lower the cotton quality, but some also believe it is beneficial to the soil. The hibernation of boll weevils is about 10% more than last year.</p>

<h3>Grain and Downstream Rice Market Suddenly Tightens</h3>
<p>South Side: Yesterday, it was cold and windy, and there were few arrivals downstream. Shops in this street became active. Ordinary Northern Non-glutinous rice and Jiangsu Same White Non-glutinous rice suddenly increased by $0.20. There was a slight amount of Bo Dao Ning rice available, and sales were stable. There was not much refined Lu Yang rice available, and the price was high. Early rice was sold as soon as it arrived, with prices increasing significantly. There were not many sales of foreign rice to customers, and there were price cuts. Futures prices continued to be sold off by foreign firms, and the market was stable.</p>
<p>New Gate: Yesterday, the weather was not good, and there was a limited supply of Ordinary Xi Bai Non-glutinous rice. There was a slight amount of sporadic sales. The top and second grades showed no improvement. Shops purchased inventory. Wuxi and Kunshan rice each increased by $0.20. There was a lack of Chonggu and Songjiang Bo Dao rice arriving, and the situation tightened by $0.10. There was a limited supply of Yang Du refined rice arriving, and downstream areas and rice mills had a slight amount of inventory, also increasing by $0.20. Glutinous rice sales were flat, and the market had no ups or downs. Westbound rice boats, including Changshu, Kunshan, Danyang, and Jiaoli Beiban, numbered over thirty.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Looks to Rise</h3>
<p>Impact of Military Operations in Annam: Yesterday, the foreign rice market suddenly became active. Various foreign firms stopped selling, and brokers did not return to sell. It was reported that French troops were conducting military operations in Annam, and Saigon rice may be banned from export. Therefore, people hoped for improvement, and the market is expected to rise. However, there has been no action from customer groups, and there is still a large amount of fixed rice in various parts of Burma. Whether prices can rise is still uncertain. Spot rice from the Hankou group has stopped shipping. This street handled one shipment of Saigon rice for $11.20 per bag, and 500 bags of small-grain rice for $9.60 to $9.35 per bag.</p>
<h3>Flour Falls Sharply, Then Slightly Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, flour generally showed a sharp fall followed by a slight rebound. Foreign wheat quotations rebounded by about $0.02-0.03. In addition, after the large sell-off the day before, various factories were watching and waiting. Because factories must have foreign wheat orders placed before they are willing to sell, otherwise they will ignore any rises or falls, people's hearts have settled slightly, and the market has also rebounded by $0.01-0.02. However, if foreign wheat continues to be inquired about, the situation is still not optimistic. As a result, this month increased by $0.01 compared to the previous day, January increased by $0.01, February to April each increased by $0.0225, and May increased by $0.02.</p>
<h3>Forward Wheat Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the forward wheat market showed signs of a general rise. Because this month is only one week away from delivery, off-market buying and selling must be settled. If flour sales are still good, factories still intend to collect this month's goods. However, the current situation offers little hope for the future, so the market atmosphere has not improved. Forward months all saw rebounds as foreign wheat was quoted higher and short covering was quite active. However, in general, this kind of rebound has little foundation. As a result, this month decreased by $0.01 compared to the previous day, January increased by $0.02, and February to April each increased by $0.06.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods, Longkou Vermicelli Sold as Soon as it Arrives</h3>
<p>Market Price Slightly Loosens</p>
<p>Longkou cellophane noodles had previously sold for 24 taels due to scarcity of arrivals and inventory. A batch has now arrived from Yantai on the Lisheng Wheel. It was heard yesterday that over 300 packages had been opened, with prices ranging from 23.5 to 23.7 taels, slightly looser than before. The market is still active among various groups, and prices have also decreased slightly. Yesterday, the market price for grade A leather was 23.5 taels, with slightly lower prices for lesser grades, and the trend was flat.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Decreases, Cheaper</h3>
<p>Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber: Sales have been sluggish recently, so customer demand is very weak. Recently, lower-grade goods have been released, and prices are cheap, only 12-13 yuan. As for export groups and mainland areas in this street, there are no large-scale purchases, so the market is unlikely to recover in the short term. Yesterday, the market price was 17-18 yuan for top-grade, 14-15 yuan for middle-grade, and around 13 yuan for lower-grade.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Serge Sales Stagnant, Prices Flat</h3>
<p>Yuan Chang Blue-Gray Assorted Serge: Last month it was quite lively, but recently it has turned weak. As the weather gradually turns cold, sales are stagnant, and as the end of the year approaches, various groups are saving. As a result, sales of medium-thick serge have decreased sharply, and prices have also decreased accordingly. However, the serge market is still stable, and there has been no special decline. For example, Ningfeng Pengshou sells for 2.6 taels, Deji Dafacai for 3.7 taels, Tianxiang 99 for 3.625 taels, Baoduo 7630 for 3.25 taels, Dongfang 3008 medium-thick serge for 3.5 taels, Yongle for 4.5 taels, and Shiduo for 5.65 taels.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, Foreign Firms: Silk Market Increasingly Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market was increasingly quiet and weak. Telegrams from New York and Lyon reported that Chinese silk was trending weak due to the sharp fall in Japanese silk in Yokohama. European firms were increasingly watching and waiting, and the market atmosphere was quiet. Yesterday, only Jardine Matheson added 10 bales of Huang silk, Sino-American added 10 bales of white dry silk, and Mei Da added 5 bales of Huang coarse silk, and the prices remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Needle-Shaped, Beautiful Eyebrow Tea Sales Still Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm tea market, there were telegram orders for needle-shaped and beautiful eyebrow green tea from the French Moroccan market for both inland and foreign firms. The entire market saw Jinlong, Jardine Matheson, and other firms purchase over 200 boxes, and the route was still smooth, and the market was quite strong. As for Zhenmei green tea, British firms were still keen on medium and low-grade goods, but there was no major development in high-grade goods.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Li Jingcong Discusses Test Flights to Xinjiang</h3>
<p>Today, Mr. Li Undertakes an Unprecedented Long-Distance Flight</p>
<p>Details Northwest Test Flight to Reporters</p>
<p>The Riri News Agency reports: Li Jingcong, an expert in pioneering aviation in remote areas, head of the Aviation Department of the Ministry of Transportation, and concurrently head of the Operations Section of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, successfully opened the air route from Beiping to Manchuria across the Hinggan Mountains in May of this year. It is now learned that he is scheduled to undertake a test flight to Xinjiang today (the 13th), which is an unprecedented initiative in Chinese aviation. Yesterday, a Riri News Agency reporter visited Mr. Li for a lengthy conversation, during which he provided a detailed account of the events before and after the Northwest test flight. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Test Flight: The Northwest route is one of the three major air routes planned by the Ministry of Transportation and the Qingcheng Corporation. Previously, the company believed that the public's understanding of aviation was still weak, making it difficult to develop aviation business. Furthermore, due to limited capital, it was difficult to prepare for this world's only long-distance route in a short period of time. Therefore, it was decided to postpone the endeavor for three to five years. However, the Party and government authorities, along with the general public, deeply felt that the situation between the inland and remote areas was too isolated, and the flow of information was too obstructed. This led to direct or indirect impacts on politics, culture, national defense, industry, and other aspects, resulting in a near-unanimous demand for immediate action. The company, unwilling to disregard the expectations of the entire nation, had no choice but to reluctantly undertake the task. Furthermore, due to being shot at by Mongolian soldiers while passing through Outer Mongolia in July and being obstructed by Japanese troops during a test flight to Taonan in September, the company decided to overcome the difficulties and first conduct the Northwest test flight. After its success, preparations for formally opening the route would be made based on the actual situation.</p>
<p>Route Selection: After the company decided to conduct the test flight, General Manager Shuang Qing sent Mr. Li and Mr. Schmidt to Beiping in October to make preparations. The most important aspect of the preparations was the route selection. Based on geographical and climatic factors, Mr. Li and his team originally planned to adopt a route of approximately 4,000 kilometers from Shanghai to Beijing, passing through Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu directly into Xinjiang. According to investigations, although Henan Province has strong winds, it is a vast plain, making it easy to land in case of difficulties, minimizing the possibility of accidents. Shaanxi and Gansu, on the other hand, experience fewer drastic climate changes, and the mountains are not particularly high. Furthermore, the route passes through major cities with airfields or vast plains suitable for landing. However, due to the prevalence of bandits in Gansu Province, making it impossible to transport gasoline, this route could not be selected. Instead, the current route of approximately 4,200 kilometers from Shanghai to Beijing, then through Shandong, Hebei, Suiyuan, Ningxia, and directly into Xinjiang was adopted. Except for the smooth journey from Shanghai to Beiping, there are no difficulties on this route. However, the section from Beiping to Bailin Temple in Suiyuan requires traversing dense mountains. The section from Bailin Temple to Ruoshui River in Ningxia requires crossing vast wilderness. The same applies to the section from Ruoshui River to Hami in Xinjiang. Moreover, these areas frequently experience strong winds and severe cold weather. According to investigations, there are many places to land and the climate is good from Hami to Dihua, which is not as daunting and concerning as the sections between Bailin Temple and Ruoshui River, and Ruoshui River and Hami. On these two sections, straying from the designated route would lead to being lost in the boundless wilderness, with no signs of life and no water, posing a deadly threat to travelers. The designated route is also easily covered by sandstorms. If the aircraft encounters such a situation during the initial test flight, and the engine also malfunctions, it is difficult to imagine how rescue could be carried out. It is regrettable that the ideal and suitable route through the Shaanxi-Gansu heartland cannot be used due to the prevalence of bandits and the impossibility of transporting gasoline.</p>
<p>Gasoline Storage: Except for Bailin Temple, which is only over a hundred kilometers from Guihua, making gasoline transportation and storage relatively easy, the company hired a Swedish national familiar with the Ruoshui River area, Mr. Ruisenheng, at great expense. It took him over forty days to transport and store gasoline in the upper reaches of the Ruoshui River, a place suitable for aircraft landing and a ground landmark, located dozens of kilometers south of Juyanhai, also known as Youhe. Inland merchants traveling to Xinjiang typically travel in groups, employing Mongolians as guides. However, the Mongolian guides only know the direction to follow from one station to another and where to cross the Ruoshui River. They are unaware of the exact location of the crossing point on the Ruoshui River, the surrounding terrain, and whether it is suitable for aircraft landing. The opening of inland transportation requires seeking guidance from foreign lands, which is truly lamentable. Regarding the gasoline to be prepared in Xinjiang, the Ministry of Transportation has requested the Xinjiang Provincial Government to purchase Russian aircraft gasoline locally. Since Russia has already established two air routes to the Xinjiang border, with a significant amount of gasoline stored at the border, purchasing from them is faster and cheaper than transporting from the inland, saving up to three months of time.</p>
<p>Aircraft Improvements: The Northwest route, from Beiping to Hami, requires traversing approximately 2,000 kilometers of dense mountains and vast wilderness with obstructed transportation and sparse population. It is truly a long-distance route unique in the world and difficult to manage. Therefore, the selection of aircraft components should prioritize durability, suitability for long-distance travel, and a proven track record. The aircraft used by the company for the test flight meets the above requirements. It is a Junkers W33, serial number 33, all-metal fuselage, with a Junkers L5, 300-horsepower engine, a carrying capacity of 1,200 kilograms, a flight speed of 180 kilometers per hour, and an endurance of ten hours, or 1,800 kilometers. Special improvements and ample additions have been made to personnel cold protection, engine insulation, water filtration, fire prevention, and other equipment. Regarding personnel, before deciding to conduct the Northwest test flight, the company requested the Ministry of Transportation to inquire with the Xinjiang authorities about their opinions. They received a reply expressing their welcome and providing various reports related to aviation, such as ground and climate conditions.</p>
<p>The company also requested the Ministry of Transportation to telegraph the authorities of Suiyuan and Ningxia provinces, ordering military police and banner leaders along the route to provide full protection and assistance. Furthermore, General Manager Shuang Qing went north to Beiping to oversee everything. Beiping is the central hub of the entire Shanghai-Xinjiang line, making it the most convenient location to handle any unexpected technical or personnel issues. Therefore, the company does not anticipate difficulties with these preparations, especially in terms of personnel. Publicity and Mail Delivery: In addition to submitting a request to the National Government through the Ministry of Transportation and consulting relevant authorities to have various official documents recently sent to Xinjiang delivered by the company, the company also sent a letter to the Directorate General of Posts, instructing the Shanghai and Beiping postal administrations to package five kilograms of recently mailed letters to Xinjiang separately and hand them over to the company for postal flight testing. Separate letters were sent to major newspapers in Shanghai and Beiping, requesting them to package ten copies of the day's news each and hand them over to the company for promotional purposes. Furthermore, the company and the China Weekly News Agency reprinted various printed materials to be distributed in the air upon arrival in Dihua to increase the Northwest public's understanding of aviation.</p>
<p>Flight Time and Location: Mr. Li is scheduled to lead Eurasia No. 3 to Beiping today (Sunday, the 13th). After resting in Beiping for one day, he will switch to Eurasia No. 1 at 8:00 a.m. on the 15th and fly to Bailin Temple, a distance of over 520 kilometers, arriving at 10:55 a.m. After arriving, about half a day will be needed for arrangements. At 8:00 a.m. on the 16th, he will fly to Ruoshui River, a distance of over 780 kilometers from Bailin Temple, arriving at 12:20 p.m. After arriving, about half a day will be needed for arrangements. At 8:00 a.m. on the 17th, he will fly to Hami, a distance of over 660 kilometers from Ruoshui River, arriving at 11:40 a.m. After arriving, about half a day will be needed for arrangements. At 8:00 a.m. on the 18th, he will fly to Dihua, a distance of only over 460 kilometers, arriving at 10:35 a.m. Approximately at least one week will be needed in Dihua for arrangements and negotiations. At 8:00 a.m. on the 25th, he will fly to Tacheng, a distance of over 500 kilometers from Dihua, arriving at 10:50 a.m. After arriving, arrangements and negotiations will take about one and a half days. At 7:00 a.m. on the 27th, he should be able to fly back to Dihua. Whether he flies back to Beiping from Dihua in one go or in multiple stages will depend on the situation at that time. In any case, barring weather or other obstacles, he will definitely return to Shanghai within the year to report to the head office. Future Plans: After the success of this test flight, the first step will be to purchase equipment, recruit personnel, open airfields, build hangars, store gasoline, install wireless communication equipment, and establish necessary facilities for weather observation, emergency rescue, and sanitation. All of these will take at least three to four months. If there are no other obstacles in the meantime, the route can be officially opened by the end of April or the beginning of May next year. The second step will be to negotiate with Russia for joint operations in the Sino-Russian border area in Xinjiang. Eurasian postal flights cannot save much time and money unless they pass through Russia or engage in joint operations with Russia, which is too far from the original purpose of rapid air delivery. Passing through Russia is not currently feasible because Sino-Russian diplomatic relations have not been restored, but the Russian side has already approved the joint operation in Manchuria. Since this section has already been approved, it is expected that there will be no questions raised in the future about changing to joint operations in the Sino-Russian border area in Xinjiang. Furthermore, it takes six days to travel from Manchuria to Europe via Russia, compared to only five days from Xinjiang, saving one day in terms of time. This is not only what the people of Eurasia hope for, but Russia will also be more than willing to assist in this beneficial global undertaking. The third step is to reduce the flight time between Shanghai and Xinjiang. The air route from Shanghai to Xinjiang is over 4,200 kilometers long, and the flight time is approximately 24 hours. Except in summer, when it is possible to barely complete the flight in two days, it cannot be completed in less than three days in winter. To reduce the flight time, nighttime flight equipment is necessary. The most suitable section for nighttime flight equipment on this entire route is the Shanghai-Beiping section, and the section that best meets the principles of time and economic efficiency is the Bailin Temple-Hami section. However, since the Bailin Temple-Hami section passes through wilderness and often experiences strong winds, it is not easy to implement in the short term. Currently, only the Shanghai-Beiping section can be implemented. With successful implementation of the Shanghai-Beiping section, the journey from Shanghai to Xinjiang in winter will take two days and one night, while in summer it will only take one day and one night. In conclusion, the success of this route is of great importance both domestically and internationally. Mr. Li is extremely hopeful that this trip will be worthwhile.</p>
<h3>A Visit with Mayor Zhang</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mayor Zhang yesterday evening to inquire about everything. Mayor Zhang answered each question in detail. A brief record is as follows: (Question) We heard that the Mayor's health is not well, so we came to inquire. How have you been recently? (Answer) My physical condition is still strong, but since the Northeast foreign invasion and the frequent international disputes in Shanghai, I have been focusing on these matters for the past three months, and I feel mentally and physically exhausted. Unexpectedly, a student protest suddenly erupted the other day. Although I tried my best to endure and bear the burden to quell the incident and appease the people, I could not sleep afterwards and felt brain swelling and headaches. I still feel unwell now. (Question) We heard that the Mayor planned to make an announcement to the newspapers the other day. Why has it not been published yet? (Answer) That is true, but the Central Government has ordered Commander Chen to investigate this case. As a rule, no public statements should be made during the investigation. However, I have prepared a detailed report of the incident and sent it to Commander Chen for an impartial investigation. It will be announced in due course. (Question) Are the news reports about the case and the Mayor's comments in the newspapers in recent days accurate? (Answer) There are some discrepancies, which I believe are due to errors in the rumors. (Question) The Central Government has sent a telegram to persuade you to stay. Can the Mayor's resignation be withdrawn? (Answer) I am determined to resign and have telegraphed again to request my resignation. If I am not allowed to resign, I will go to Beijing to insist on my resignation.</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Announces His Views on Investigating the Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>Chen Mingshu, the Commander of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison, made the following comments to a Central News Agency reporter after receiving an order from the National Government to thoroughly investigate the student protest in Shanghai: I have come to Shanghai on the orders of the Central Government to investigate the unfortunate incident that occurred in Shanghai. I will conduct an impartial and thorough investigation to clarify the truth and report it to the Central Government for review and handling. During this investigation, I sincerely hope that all parties will remain calm, respect local order, and avoid creating further disputes, which would weaken the nation's united strength against foreign aggression. I believe that the Central Government will also handle this case impartially to satisfy public opinion. Chen went to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>Student Representatives from Various Universities Paid a Visit to Commander Chen Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chen said that students should contribute opinions within the proper framework</p>
<p>And form a united force against foreign aggression with the government</p>
<p>And not forget the original intention of the student national salvation movement</p>
<p>Shen Zuru, Liu Ping, Lin Zumo, Wang Lizhong, Guan Zhaohui, Sheng Yuhua, Xiong Daji, and other representatives from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Union of Shanghai Universities visited Commander Chen Mingshu of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison at 6:00 p.m. yesterday to report on the Shanghai student protests on the 9th. After the representatives finished speaking, Chen expressed his views on the investigation of the student protests, saying: The course of the student protests has been investigated clearly, and I will be responsible for reporting the truth to the Central Government for disposition. As for the student national salvation movement, it arises from the purest and noblest enthusiasm. The government should sincerely accept this kind of well-intentioned petition, try its best to prevent military police from having misunderstandings and conflicts with the masses, and at the same time try its best to make the masses understand the government's diplomatic policy. The current organization of the Central National Crisis Conference and Mr. Wang's proposal for a national salvation conference are attempts to allow the public to participate in diplomacy. As for whether to advocate for war or peace, it cannot be decided with one word. The government is willing to share the responsibility with the public. As for the students, they should also contribute opinions to the government within the proper framework and serve as the government's backing. Going beyond the framework is not the way for the government and the people to unite against foreign aggression. In short, I hope that all of you students will cooperate with the government in the future to form a united force against foreign aggression and awaken the masses to unleash the great national strength to save ourselves. Do not be incited by the illegal and excessive slogans of reactionary elements, so that the results will be that what was initiated for the country and the nation becomes an action that harms the country and the nation. Therefore, I especially hope that students will pay close attention and never forget the original intention of the student mass national salvation movement. After Chen's remarks, the student representatives expressed their satisfaction and returned. (New Voice News Agency)</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Association of University Professors Hosts Reporters</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of University Professors in Shanghai hosted a tea party for reporters from various newspapers at the China News Agency on Weihaiwei Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to report on the purpose of the association's organization and the attitude it holds. First, Jin Tongyin, a professor at Fudan University, delivered a speech, stating that the purpose of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of University Professors in Shanghai is to cooperate in academic research, guide young people with enthusiasm, and critique facts from a detached position. Then, Zhang Yi explained the association's attitude. The full text is as follows: "I have been entrusted by the board of directors of our association to briefly explain our association's attitude to everyone. The details are as follows: (1) Regarding the Northeast Incident, our association believes that armed resistance must be implemented, safeguarding the territory while recovering lost land. There are four reasons for this: (A) Driven by facts, Japan's aggression is endless. Since the fall of the three provinces, it has continued to attack Jinzhou, disrupt Tianjin, and threaten Shanghai and Wuhan, gradually invading the hinterland. Without resistance, the country will inevitably perish. (B) Promoting unity. If those in power can truly rise up to defend the country, it will not be difficult to restore public trust, and internal unity will not be a problem. (C) Coercing the powers. If the war expands and endangers the East Asian market, the powers will inevitably make more impartial demands based on their interests. Simply wagging our tails and begging them will only result in perfunctory treatment. (D) Maintaining national dignity. If the country is humiliated to this extent and still swallows its anger and endures humiliation, it will be unworthy of survival in the world. The public should have long known that the League of Nations is unreliable. The recent resolution clearly favors Japan, and the investigation team is particularly unfavorable to our country. Our association firmly opposes it. (2) Regarding the attitude towards the government, our association observes the government and believes that it is (A) not clean,</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>(B) without a direction, (C) without ability. Such a government is already difficult to handle in peacetime. Today, with the national crisis at hand, we know that it will cause great harm. However, since it is actually exercising its powers, our association believes that it must be subject to strict supervision by the people. Recently, the government has always asked the people to trust it. In fact, the people have always longed for a trustworthy government. In the past four years, the people have never interfered in politics, which can be said to be the utmost trust, but the result has become the current situation. "To this day, they still do not know how to repent," and they empty words of being determined to resist foreign aggression. They have made no military preparations, are unwilling to be open in diplomacy, only know to trust the League of Nations, and internally, there is no hope of unity. They do not know how to properly guide the spontaneous patriotism of students, but instead falsely accuse them of being incited by others. How can such actions make the people trust them? "Therefore, our association insists on the necessity of supervision. As for the national crisis conference that the government is preparing, it must be an organ that can truly represent public opinion in order to be accepted by the public. If the government arbitrarily appoints a number of people who are obedient to the government's wishes to cover up the eyes and ears of the people, then the crime will be more unforgivable than simply ignoring the people's wishes." (3) Regarding the attitude towards the party headquarters, the responsibility of the party headquarters, according to themselves, is to supervise the government and guide the people, but in fact, diplomacy has failed to such an extent, what can the party headquarters do? The government is produced by the party, and what supervision does the party give it? Moreover, at this critical moment, they are still splitting and quarreling, determined to plunge the country into eternal ruin. They are not making efforts for the anti-Japanese national salvation work, can they guide the people? In the past, we have only seen them suppressing speech, interfering with meetings, and detaining news. For those who disagree with them, they often add the title of "reactionary" to vent personal grudges. The lives of the country and the nation have long been out of their minds. Recently, incidents of kidnapping students have actually occurred in this city, which is truly unbearable to speak of." It is found that the party headquarters is not an administrative agency, and in the future, its powers should be strictly limited, its personnel should be strictly screened, and its speech and actions should be subject to legal sanctions just like the people. (4) Regarding the student movement, since 1927, the spirit of the May Fourth Movement has been lost. Under high pressure, the students appear to be disciplined, but in fact their core has long been decadent. There are three main symptoms: (A) living frivolously, (B) unwilling to study diligently, and (C) currying favor with officials to engage in personal political activities. It can be said that they have been numb for a long time. This time, driven by their conscience, they have shown patriotism and swept away the accumulated malpractices over the years, which can be said to be commendable. This movement has made great contributions to the country, and it is also a transformative turning point for the students themselves. The future of the country depends on the youth. It is necessary to have young people with strong will, clear minds, and rich emotions to create a brand new country. Therefore, we hope that the anti-Japanese national salvation movement can be expanded into the New Youth Movement, which is the fundamental plan for saving the country. This admirable and valuable vigorous vitality of the New Youth is also the vitality of the Chinese nation. Our association is willing to support it wholeheartedly. In short, our association recognizes its own position and mission, and its attitude is not willing to be brutal, but it is extremely firm. It not only has firm views, but will also take action when necessary. We are honored by your presence today, and we hope that you will give us your guidance."</p>
<p>Then, Xie Xunchu reported on the association's work, stating that the association was established on November 27th and has only been two weeks since, so there are no achievements to speak of. As for the work, it is divided into three departments: research, translation, and propaganda. Finally, Fan Jingwu represented the guests and gave a speech, hoping that the association would be permanently established and strive forward.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Delivers an Important Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Salvation Conference is Different from the National Crisis Conference</p>
<p>The Powers and Limits of the Party Headquarters and Government Agencies Must Be Delineated</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingwei, a representative from Guangdong, gave the following speech to reporters from various news agencies yesterday: Reporter (Question) Are the National Salvation Conference advocated by Mr. Wang and the National Crisis Conference the same in name and substance? Wang (Answer) The important constituent members of the National Salvation Conference I advocate are representatives of people's organizations. This is the difference between the National Salvation Conference and the National Crisis Conference. (Question) Are celebrities and scholars required to join? (Answer) Of course, they are welcome, but the important constituent members must be representatives of people's organizations. Only in this way can the foundation of democratic politics be established. (Question) Is this conference a temporary conference specifically set up to deal with the national crisis? (Answer) In order to deal with the national crisis, there should be this conference. Even if the national crisis is over, there only needs to be an organ representing public opinion in peacetime. (Question) Are the candidates for this organ representing public opinion limited to members of the Chinese Nationalist Party? (Answer) Of course, they are not limited to members of the Chinese Nationalist Party. (Question) If so, does it conflict with party rule? (Answer) To answer this question, please review my essays "How to Establish Democratic Forces" published on November 3, 1929, and "How to Realize Democratic Politics" published on October 20, 1929. You should know that for several years, I have consistently advocated that the people's rights in the tutelage era should increase day by day in time and expand day by day in space. Only in this way can the purpose of tutelage be achieved, and only then can we transition from tutelage to constitutionalism. (Question) In Mr. Wang's opinion, what should be the relationship between the party headquarters and the people? (Answer) To answer this question, please review my essay "The Meaning of Party Rule" published on January 11, 1930. The main points are as follows: (1) Since we have determined that the party is within the people, our advocacy is not only for the above-mentioned organs of public opinion (whether it is the permanent National Assembly or the temporary National Conference, or even the small affairs of the conference organs in cities, towns, and villages), but also for various people's organizations, such as commercial groups, labor groups, peasant groups, etc., we should respect their independence. The party can only use various efforts to make them automatically accept the leadership of the party, and should never oppress them. (2) Not only is this the case for the above-mentioned organs of public opinion and people's organizations, but also the relationship between the party headquarters and government agencies must be clearly delineated. The party should guide and supervise comrades working in government agencies according to the party's ideology and policies to ensure that they are implemented. It should not directly replace government agencies and issue orders externally. (3) We advocate that the judiciary should be completely independent. (4) We advocate that there should be clear regulations on the freedom of assembly, publication, and speech of the people. The party's propositions and fundamental policies must not be violated, but in their implementation, the people outside the party should not only be allowed to participate in opinions, but also be allowed to participate in actions, and even be allowed to criticize and supervise. (Question) Does Mr. Wang still insist on this proposition now? (Answer) For several years, I and my colleagues who worked together for this proposition have been displaced and suffered hardships, and have remained unswerving. How can there be no reason to insist on it? We regard the proposition as ten times more important than the people's problems. Now, let me tell you in advance that if I and my colleagues are allowed to enter Nanjing, and this proposition cannot be implemented, then we will have no choice but to resolutely abandon it. No matter who is in power, we will hold this attitude. Furthermore, if anyone among me and my colleagues abandons this proposition, then that person will no longer be a comrade in whom we trust, and we will do our best to oppose him.</p>
<h3>Response to Mr. Wang Jingwei's Telegraph: Expressions of Support</h3>
<p>Approving the National Salvation Conference</p>
<p>Telegraph from the Kuomintang Protect-the-Party and Save-the-Nation Grand Alliance to the National Public: Mr. Wang Jingwei's telegraph expresses profound concern for the changing world situation, moving us deeply. We dare to declare our willingness to sacrifice everything to face the national crisis. If we continue to be preoccupied with power struggles, it will be not only a disaster for the Party but a calamity for the nation. We earnestly hope that our fellow citizens across the country will respond in unison to this national salvation conference and ensure its success. Regarding the organizational plan and detailed regulations, we expect Mr. Wang Jingwei to announce them soon. We await your instructions with utmost anticipation. Respectfully, the Kuomintang Protect-the-Party and Save-the-Nation Grand Alliance, bearing a true seal.</p>
<p>Letter from the Shanghai-Based Guangdong Compatriots National Salvation Joint Association to Mr. Wang Jingwei: We were deeply moved upon reading your telegraph. Our Party is fragmented, political disputes are rampant, and the foreign crisis is more pressing than ever. To restore the Party's integrity, realize democratic politics, and quell the foreign crisis, there is no other way than to urgently convene a national salvation conference comprised of representatives of the people to address the national crisis together. Our association has resolved today to firmly support your proposal. We hope that, as a leader of the people, you will expedite preparations. The future of the nation truly depends on it. With revolutionary greetings, The Shanghai-Based Guangdong Compatriots National Salvation Joint Association.</p>
<p>Telegraph from the National Salvation Comrades Association to various newspaper offices: Mr. Wang Jingwei's initiative to organize a National Salvation Conference is considered by this Association to be the one and only good method for resolving the current situation, and we express our strong support. A reply telegram was sent, stating: "To Mr. Wang Jingwei: We were deeply moved upon reading your telegraph, proposing to convene a National Salvation Conference, which profoundly captures the essence of national salvation and resonates with the people. Since the Liaoning Incident occurred nearly a month ago, the border defense commanders only know of non-resistance, and the National Government has yet to come up with a concrete solution. The League of Nations is siding with Japan, and the Japanese invaders are becoming increasingly arrogant. The country is on the verge of collapse, and the people have nowhere to die, so we must rise up to decide and save ourselves. Students are on strike, merchants are severing trade, and farmers and workers are shouting, all driven by patriotic fervor and sincere expression. If we can take advantage of this momentum and use the people's sentiment as a backing for diplomacy, we may be able to revive the national prestige. If we suppress the people's spirit and turn to deal with the Japanese invaders, we may not be able to ultimately control the winning strategy. It is a light thing to reverse the order of importance, and the top and bottom are diverging. Even if the government has unspeakable difficulties, it cannot announce them. The people are filled with righteous indignation, and there is no way to express it. Unification has not been achieved for a long time, and the Black Province has collapsed without assistance. Although there is no fact of selling the country, it is difficult to escape the name of selling the country. The people's movement is suppressed more and more, and the people's hearts are more and more separated. From this, those who are in the same hatred of the enemy will inevitably regard themselves as enemies. The so-called Republic of China will become a country of joint management. Is it not good plan? Or what method should be used to deal with this? Only in accordance with your telegram, communicate the views of the people and the field, discuss the methods of resistance, how to prepare for mobilization, how to collect funds, and various international relations, then the quantity can be expected to be substantial, and the steps can be made neat, such as the Prussian National Crisis Conference against France, such as Belgium's moment of pain against Germany, the government can proceed smoothly, the people will die without complaint, and even if it fails, there will be a day of turning defeat into victory, and even if it is destroyed, there will be a time to revive. There is no solution to difficult problems that is better than this. Please quickly produce a plan and see it implemented quickly. The colleagues of this association hold this long-cherished wish and are willing to follow behind you. The National Salvation Comrades Association of the Republic of China, bearing a true seal." We urge all compatriots across the country to respond in unison and quickly bring it to fruition. We pray earnestly. The National Salvation Comrades Association of the Republic of China, bearing a true seal.</p>
<p>Telegraph from the Guangdong and Guangxi Students Anti-Japanese Association: Telegram from the Guangdong Province and Guangxi Province Guangzhou Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Delegation to various newspaper offices: We have just read the telegraph sent by Mr. Wang Jingwei, proposing to initiate a National Salvation Conference, with representatives from people's organizations participating together, so as to establish the foundation of democratic politics, and to fully express the people's propositions and methods for rising up in the face of national difficulties. We are overcome with admiration for your wise plan for saving the country and your painful words for rectifying the times. At this time of national crisis, when foreign insults are increasing daily, it is appropriate for the whole country to be of one mind and for all to exert their efforts, removing private opinions and working together to face the outside world, so as to be able to reverse the imminent collapse and save the country's destiny. As you said, since unification cannot be achieved, the goal of jointly facing the national crisis cannot be carried out. Therefore, this National Salvation Conference is urgently needed at present. The delegation and others are concerned about the current difficulties and eager for peace. We absolutely agree with the proposals in Mr. Wang Jingwei's telegraph. We dare to offer our sincere support. We hope that compatriots across the country will agree with us, so that it can be realized as soon as possible. The country's future is deeply reliant on it. This telegram is urgent, and we ask for your clear understanding. The Huangpu Military Academy Revolutionary Comrades Association telegraph to various newspaper offices for all to see: Recently, the issue of peace talks has been pending for a long time, resulting in increasing foreign pressure and no way to resist it. The unified government cannot be realized, and comrades of this party and the people of the whole country are saddened, disappointed, and have nowhere to turn. Now, having read Mr. Wang Jingwei's telegraph, proposing to initiate a National Salvation Conference, with representatives from various people's organizations participating in the organization, to resolve all disputes and ensure that democratic politics is established as soon as possible, we believe that this proposal is truly the only good method for saving the country at present. Furthermore, considering the current situation in China, cooperation with the people is necessary to resist foreign aggression, and unity among comrades is necessary to secure domestic peace. Only cooperation can save the country from danger, and only unity can consolidate the foundation of the government. Therefore, the purpose of the National Assembly is not only to deal with foreign affairs, but also to allow the people to exercise political power during the period of political tutelage, and to be the fundamental principle for achieving democratic politics. Mr. Wang Jingwei has, for decades, fought diligently for the Party and the country, and his revolutionary proposals are evident in the eyes and ears of the people. At this time of national crisis, when time is pressing, we vow to lead all our armed comrades to sincerely support and promote its realization. We especially hope that comrades of this party and the people of the whole country will rise up together and jointly support this proposal. The future of the Party and the country truly depends on it. The Organizing Committee of the Revolutionary Comrades Association of the Huangpu Military Academy of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<p>Telegraph from the People's Diplomacy Support Association: The People's Diplomacy Support Association telegraph to various newspaper offices for all to see: The violent Japanese have been wreaking havoc in the Eastern Provinces for over eighty days. The government has consistently adhered to a policy of non-resistance, and officials have failed to assert themselves in the League of Nations. The violent Japanese have gained an inch and want a foot, and have even insisted that the Japanese army should have bandit suppression rights in the Eastern Provinces. They have even threatened to force the Chinese army to withdraw into the Pass. The people, driven by righteous indignation, have risen up to demand that the government quickly decide on a policy of self-defense. The government has not only failed to comply with the people's wishes but has also obstructed and suppressed them, causing the people's sentiments to become more and more agitated. If the people are not given the opportunity to express their opinions soon, it will inevitably lead to major accidents. Recently, Mr. Wang Jingwei's telegraph proposed to organize a National Salvation Conference, with representatives from people's organizations participating in the organization, to jointly plan how to deal with the national crisis, and to organize a preparatory meeting in Shanghai in advance. At this time when diplomacy is extremely tense and the people's sentiments are extremely agitated, it is necessary to concentrate the strength of the people of the whole country in the National Salvation Conference to urge the government to carry out diplomacy and to concentrate efforts to prepare for self-defense. There is really no other way to unify the anti-Japanese steps and enrich the anti-Japanese forces. This association expresses extreme sympathy with this. We hope that all sectors of the country will quickly unite and that Mr. Wang will publish concrete plans as soon as possible to facilitate progress. This association vows to be a supporter. The People's Diplomacy Support Association of the Republic of China, bearing a true seal.</p>
<p>Telegraph from the District Branches of the City Joint Association: The district branches of the City Morning Joint Association send a telegram to Mr. Wang Jingwei: We have read your telegraph and respectfully learned of your proposal to organize a National Salvation Conference. The news has spread widely and has been endorsed by the entire country. At this time when the national crisis is deepening and the situation is serious, this kind of organization is truly the best strategy for saving the country. We believe that the internal disputes in the country in recent years have been caused by different ideologies.

<h3>The National Government Denies the Secret Order to Arrest Major University Presidents</h3>
<p>Official Statement from the Secretariat Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, a letter from Zheng Hongnian and others was published in the newspapers. The Secretariat of the National Government issued a statement, stating that the content of the letter was not factual. The statement reads: "We have seen the letter from Zheng Hongnian, Li Zhaohuan, He Shizhen, and Chen Qun published in the Shanghai newspapers, which is quite shocking. The National Government has always been tolerant of the patriotic movements of various schools, which is a well-known fact. There has never been any order to arrest the principals of the schools whose names are on the letter. It is difficult to guess whether this letter was written according to the wishes of the signatories, but the National Government has never issued the secret order mentioned in the letter, which should be corrected. The Secretariat of the National Government."</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Foreign Advisor to Mayor Zhang</h3>
<p>Shi Zhaoji Clarifies Rumors Reported in Newspapers</p>
<p>Special Foreign Affairs Committee Telegraphed Asking Him to Withdraw His Resignation</p>
<p>The Foreign Advisor telegraphed Shanghai Mayor Zhang: "I have just received a telegram from Representative Shi stating that a certain newspaper in Paris reported yesterday that I had vaguely suggested to Dawes that Chinese troops could withdraw to Jinzhou. I met with Dawes on the morning of the 10th of this month. Dawes planned to make a statement on the Jinzhou issue that afternoon. I told him that China had no proposals to make on this issue and that we absolutely could not consider the neutral zone and the withdrawal of troops from Jinzhou. Dawes stated that he did not know about the report in the newspaper, which was clearly a rumor. I am telegraphing to clarify." Recently, there have been many misunderstandings in foreign news. Please inform the members of the Second, Fourth, and Sixth Committees of the above matters to clarify the truth. The Special Foreign Affairs Committee telegraphed Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun: "Upon receiving your telegram, we were all surprised and worried. The students' actions are excessive, mostly due to a lack of experience and a lack of central leadership. Now that the League of Nations has made a resolution and our rights have been declared and reserved, all patriotic citizens with opinions have heard and seen them. In the future, the whole country will be united and the goal of resisting foreign aggression will not be difficult to achieve. All rumors will soon disappear. Shanghai's relationship is of great importance. The government and the people are grateful for your hard work in maintaining it. We earnestly hope that you will withdraw your resignation and work hard for the country. Right and wrong will be judged fairly."</p>
<h3>Declaration by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Government Must Adopt an Open and Inclusive Attitude</p>
<p>The People Must Not Harbor Suspicion or Speculation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon at 4 PM. Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Xu Jiqing, Yuan Ludeng, Fang Jiaobo, Bei Songsun, Pei Yunqing, Zhu Wenqi, Lu Fengzhu, Luo Qinghua, Wu Zhihao, Lu Qisheng, Wen Lanting, Ma Jiyi, Cheng Xiechun, Jiang Zhigang, Lao Jingxiu, and over twenty others attended. Wang Xiaolai chaired the meeting. After a long discussion, it was decided to issue the following declaration: "Since the Japanese forcibly occupied the Three Eastern Provinces, what the people expect from the government under the current circumstances is: first, to strengthen preparations for self-defense, so that when Japanese violence comes, there will not be a situation of being caught unprepared and defeated; second, to exercise the rights of a member state of the League of Nations, and to seek the realization of all the provisions stipulated in the covenant, and not to allow the League of Nations to be timid and evasive and avoid responsibility. These two major reasons are the only way to deal with violent Japan. No matter how difficult and tortuous, the government has an unshirkable responsibility to fulfill its mission of saving the country and protecting the people. However, in the past two months, the government's actions and the facts that have been revealed to the people have not been consistent with these two major principles. In terms of self-defense, it has been trying to avoid confrontation and has been making concessions and retreats, and has not been able to show that it has the strength to protect the land and secure the people. In terms of diplomacy, the League of Nations has become more and more soft, and our country's attitude has also become more and more accommodating. When the people are heartbroken by the foreign troubles, they are stirred up with indignation and turned into disappointment, which is also a constant human emotion. However, we believe that the people should make suggestions to the government in peacetime, and should not harbor suspicion or speculation. As for when the country is in a very unusual event and the people's hearts are shaken with apprehension, they should especially abide by the poet's so-called "diligently turn to the heart, and should not have anger." All the government's facilities, such as failure to meet the will of the Prime Minister, the country and hope, should be dripping and said, phase in the ancient saying of "sincerity is the key, gold and stone is the key" purpose, and for the government, should also hold the empty has the capacity of attitude, the ancient people's hearing of the wrong is happy, see good is worship, can turn indignation into peace, if each other fire and water, mutual discrimination, then the boat enemy, moderate plan to find those who alienate the psychology, foreign force violent enemy, internal affairs strife, how can there be any reason to fortunately complete. Our Association, in its position as the leader of the city's business people, when the country is in trouble, if it is helpful to the country, then since the economic severance of relations with Japan, the capital stranded by businessmen, as well as the direct and indirect effects, although in Shanghai is an unprecedented record, it should also be喻以大义, so that it can try to endure, on the one hand, to promote domestic goods, actively produce, consolidate finance, stabilize the business market, and plant the foundation for national salvation. If you start to disturb each other, rashly stop working, and do not damage the enemy's haom, it is just enough to destroy the lifeblood of the country, then you dare not blindly follow, to tự貽复亡 of the misfortune. All in all, the work of saving the country is only in doing our best, and helping each other in the same boat. We hope that all gentlemen from all walks of life in the city will understand this together."</p>
<h3>Declaration by the Two Postal Workers' Unions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Employees' Union held an emergency joint meeting the other day, and issued a solemn declaration regarding the incident of the Student Federation, stating: "To all organizations and newspaper offices, and to our fellow compatriots across the country: Since the Kuomintang has been in power, all the measures taken have been limited by the difficulties of the times, and those that can satisfy the people's aspirations have been very few. As of today, an unprecedented flood and the Shenyang Incident have forced the authorities to take the blame for negligence and to fulfill their responsibility to remedy the situation. At this time of crisis, the people, seeing that there is no time to save the dying, how can they bear to blame them for their faults? They should also understand the difficulty of dealing with the situation, which the authorities cannot bear alone. Therefore, on the one hand, they have risen up to organize and urge the authorities, and on the other hand, they are rushing to risk their lives to help the victims, hoping to save the country from danger in an instant, and to fulfill their duty as citizens. Their hearts are extremely bitter, and their situation is extremely miserable. However, up until now, the peace and defense that the people have been striving for have not been realized. The international situation is deteriorating, and the Japanese invaders are attacking more and more urgently. The people are crying and begging, but they have not heard that the authorities have given them any consideration. At this time, the people, driven by righteousness, have risen up to carry out the national salvation movement. Even if there are occasional extreme situations, it is a direct expression of the people's legitimate demands and an indirect symbol of the authorities' failure to fulfill their responsibilities. The authorities cannot guide them to the right path, but only use obstruction as a strategy. If this continues, when will the disputes end? This Association, in view of the difficulties of the times, specially convened an emergency joint meeting on the 11th, and all agreed that the incident of the Student Federation was the result of the authorities' inability to guide the patriotic movement of the people, and indirectly was caused by the failure to achieve peaceful unification within the country. The way to get to the root of the problem is that, on the part of the authorities, both the Ning and Yue sides should abide by the resolutions of the peace talks, with Commander-in-Chief Jiang of the Ning side going north to recover the lost territory on an appointed date, and the members of the Yue side immediately going to Beijing to jointly bear the responsibility of the country, establish a unified government, and revive the national revolution. On the part of the people, they should all be based on the spirit of patriotism, improve their organizations, unify their steps, concentrate their strength, and support each other. When necessary, they can organize a joint meeting of people's organizations to connect with the government authorities and achieve the effect of mutual support. Regarding this incident, the authorities should make a positive determination to properly handle the aftermath so that this dispute can be peacefully resolved. Saving the Party and saving the country depend on this. This Association and others are not behind anyone in their love of country and revolution. All propositions concerning national affairs have been communicated and declared in the past, and we will continue to seek their implementation in the spirit of revolution. We hereby declare this, and we hope that you will all understand."</p>

<h3>Record of the Interrogation of Hong Weiji</h3>
<p>Arrested and Searched at Hong's Residence Due to Report from Chinese Authorities</p>
<p>Defendant Released on Bail by Shen Junru</p>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the 15th</p>
<p>Hong Weiji, also known as Wei Ji, a 30-year-old student at the Shanghai Art College and chairman of the Anti-Japanese Association, who previously served as a people's court judge in the Shanghai Municipal Government, was arrested by the French police on suspicion of being a communist. He was later released on bail by the secretary of the Municipal Government. Yesterday morning, he was summoned by the police to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for questioning. A large number of people were present to observe the proceedings, including classmates from the Art College and students from other schools, creating a crowded scene. At 10 AM, acting presiding judge Guo Dechang, along with judges Zhang Chaozuo and Li Changnian, prosecutor Zhang Zongkan, and clerk Liu Zongyi, took their seats in the first courtroom for the hearing. First, Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, presented the case, stating that the arrest was based on a report from the Chinese authorities that the defendant was suspected of being a communist, but the details were unclear. The defendant, Hong Weiji, stated that he found it strange that the police lawyer said the case was unclear. He asked how he could be arrested if the details were unknown. On the night of his arrest, he had been working as a people's judge during the day and was sleeping at home (upstairs at No. 16 Wende Lane, Beile Road). Police detectives knocked on the door and entered, but his door was unlocked, so the detectives went straight into the bedroom and arrested him. The detectives found a paper package on the table, which they claimed was communist evidence. Hong said that the paper package was sealed and he did not know where it came from. The detectives searched the drawers and other places and confiscated writings by students and anti-Japanese leaflets from the Datong Bookstore, but nothing else. He was taken to the Songshan Road Police Station. The next morning, he was sent to the General Police Station. The detectives asked him if he was a communist, which he denied. They then began to beat him, causing him to bleed, as evidenced by a medical certificate. The official asked if he had admitted at the police station that the communist leaflets were given to him by his friend Zhang Jie. Hong replied that he had. The police had told him to say that. Although Zhang was his classmate, the leaflets were not given to him by Zhang. He was asked if Zhang Jie had asked him to join the Communist Party when he gave him the leaflets. He said that he had not joined. The official asked if this was true. Hong replied that this was also what the detectives told him to say. He was also asked if Zhang Jie was a communist, to which he replied that he did not know. He was asked if he had heard Zhang Jie mention joining the Communist Party, to which he replied that he had not. The official asked the police lawyer who had motivated Hong's arrest. Lawyer Gu replied that it was the Chinese authorities. The lawyer had not inquired in detail due to the short time he had to attend court. He requested that the presiding judge question the Western detective who was handling the case for more details. The official ordered the Western detective to appear. The detective stated that the police had received a report from the Chinese authorities and went to the defendant's home to search. They found a paper package on the table, which contained communist leaflets. When asked, Hong stated that the leaflets were given to him by his friend Zhang Jie, and he intended to distribute them on the 11th. Hong Weiji stated that the detective's report was not consistent with the facts. The official asked the police lawyer if the police had any concrete evidence to prove that Hong was a communist. Lawyer Gu then asked the Western detective in French and replied that the Western detective said that in June of this year, regarding the Annam communist incident, the defendant had reported it. The official asked the defendant if it was true that he had reported it. Lawyer Gu asked the Western detective again, who replied that the police could not remember whether the defendant had come to report it, but they knew that the defendant often associated with the Annam communists. The official asked Hong Weiji if it was true, and Hong replied that it was not true at all. The police lawyer stated that to know the details, it would be necessary to request a postponement. At this point, the defendant's defense lawyers objected to the postponement. Prosecutor Zhang stated that all the evidence was already on file and requested that the debate begin. Presiding Judge Guo then ordered the debate to begin. First, the police lawyer argued that the police were only acting on a report from the Chinese authorities, alleging that the defendant was suspected of being a communist and endangering the Republic of China. The police arrested him because it was related to the security of the concession, and there were no other special circumstances. Next, the defendant's lawyers, Shen Junru and Zhang Runmin, argued that there was no evidence whatsoever to support the police's accusation that the defendant was a communist. If the defendant had communist activities, they would naturally be very secret, so why would he leave the door unlocked while sleeping and place communist leaflets on the table? The defendant, Hong Weiji, is the chairman of the Anti-Japanese Association and served as a people's judge before. That is why he was noticed. Furthermore, the incident of the student being abducted occurred on the 9th. The defense lawyers certified that the defendant's attitude was frank. This case occurred entirely after the defendant left the people's court, which shows that he was framed. They requested that he be declared innocent. Presiding Judge Guo declared the debate closed and announced that the sentencing would be held at 2 PM on the 15th. The defendant was ordered to be released on bail and appear whenever summoned. He was then released on bail by his lawyer, Shen Junru.</p>
<h3>German Conspires with American to Steal Large Quantities of Relief Wheat</h3>
<p>Selling the Wheat for Profit</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Crime Was Discovered and Arrests Made</p>
<p>This autumn, floods spread across various provinces, with Jiangsu, Hankou, and northern Jiangsu being the worst affected. People were displaced, and the dead were lying everywhere. The government and the United States purchased a large quantity of wheat for disaster relief in China. Several shipments have already been delivered to Shanghai and distributed to starving victims, as reported in the newspapers. A certain ship recently arrived in Shanghai with a large quantity of wheat, which was then unloaded onto a barge hired from the China Transportation Company at No. 24 Huangpu Bund Road. 946 bags of wheat worth 6,000 yuan were loaded onto the barge, which was docked in the river at the Yangshupu Lan Road wharf, for transportation to Hankou and northern Jiangsu to provide relief to starving victims. A German named Pian Tuo conspired with an American named Xie Gai, residing at No. 8 Yuanmingyuan Road, to remove all the wheat from the barge and transport it by car to a house at No. 23 Fude Road for storage, intending to secretly sell it for profit. However, a German named Tai Si discovered the plot and secretly reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. Western Detective Chief Nai Tieshan and others arrested Xie Gai and Pian Tuo one after another. Xie Gai was sent to the American Consulate for trial. The police also went to No. 23 Fude Road, recovered the stolen wheat, and brought it to the police station. Yesterday morning, Pian Tuo was sent to the First Special Court, Higher Court I. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the case and said that they were waiting for Xie Gai's interrogation by the American Consulate to verify the testimony of the defendant, so they requested a postponement. Western Detective Chief Nai Tie also stated that because Xie Gai owed him money, he said that this kind of wheat was bought by the United States and mortgaged to him. I didn't know that it was for disaster relief. After hearing his explanation, Judge Shen Bingrong ordered him to be detained and rescheduled the trial. The stolen goods were first handed over to the owner to take away.</p>
<h3>Min Ti Ni Junction Uses Automatic Telephones</h3>
<p>Telephone Company's Complete Plan</p>
<p>Two-Thirds Already Realized</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company is constructing the Min Ti Ni Junction at No. 106 Baliqiao Road in the French Concession, and is retrofitting with automatic telephones.</p>
<h3>Exterior of the Min-ti-ni Exchange</h3>
<p>Since construction began last August, it has been completed today. Telephones in the area will be switched to automatic operation today. The new three-story building is temporarily equipped with 6,000 pairs of lines, and can be expanded to 10,000 pairs in the future. If business develops, another machine can be added, laying 10,000 pairs of lines. Because the number of residents in the French Concession is increasing day by day, more room has been left for future development. Since last August, the company has successively built new exchanges and renovated automatic telephones. Five areas have now been completed, namely the central exchange, where telephone numbers begin with "1," the Huishan exchange, where telephone numbers begin with "5," the Bi-xun exchange, where telephone numbers begin with "7," the Min-ti-ni exchange, where telephone numbers begin with "8," and the Fujian exchange, where telephone numbers begin with "9." There are still three remaining manual exchanges, namely the Route des Soeurs exchange, where telephone numbers begin with "2," the western exchange, where telephone numbers begin with "3," and the northern exchange, where telephone numbers begin with "4." It is now estimated that two-thirds of the company's telephones have been converted to automatic telephones, and all telephones in the French Concession have been converted to automatic telephones since the completion of the Min-ti-ni exchange today.</p>
<h3>Telegram from Veteran Party Member You Lie</h3>
<p>A telegram from You Lie, a veteran member of the Nationalist Party, reads (titles omitted): "To the esteemed public, since the recovery of Xinhai, twenty years have passed in an instant. Internal strife has been incessant, disasters have been frequent, the people have been impoverished, and national defense has been lax, leading to foreign enemies taking advantage of the situation and strong neighbors seizing opportunities for aggression. Now the Japanese invaders' conspiracies have been exposed, and their ferocious flames are raging. The League of Nations' justice is not upheld, and the effectiveness of the agreements has been lost. In this period, crises are lurking everywhere, and dangers are pervasive. Our country has fallen into a state of nine deaths and one life, where advancement and retreat are both fraught with peril. As an old and mediocre man, I have endured much hardship. I do not wish to comment on national affairs, but seeing that the national pulse is about to be severed and the nation is on the verge of extinction, I am alarmed and vigilant, and I cannot help but speak out. At this critical and urgent time of life and death, all those with blood and spirit, regardless of whether they are in or out of office, or which party or faction they belong to, should eliminate prejudices, unite sincerely, concentrate all efforts, realize consistent demands, and avoid clinging to rigid demands, lest they cause further disputes. Do not take advantage of the situation or resort to trickery to achieve selfish desires. If we can gather the wise men of the country, unleash the true will of the people, reform and start anew, and strive for strength, we can work together with one heart and confront foreign enemies, then we can uphold justice, establish a diplomatic policy, and actively plan and prepare for armed resistance. Moreover, with the firm and激昂spirit of the people as a backing, we will surely be able to uphold justice, and with a powerful army that is just and righteous, we will be able to kill the enemy. What difficulty is there in destroying them as easily as eating breakfast? What is valuable is careful consideration and planning, fulfilling responsibilities and guarding boundaries, acting in a consistent order, and supporting each other, so that victory can be assured and mistakes can be avoided. Although I am old, I am willing to lead loyal comrades at home and abroad to prepare and await orders, ready to serve as a vanguard and face the national crisis together. This statement is urgent and I will never waver from my determination to die. I hope you will consider this. You Lie bows. Text and telegram to be sent from No. 114 North Sichuan Road, An Shen Fang Kou, 2nd floor, Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Departure of the Youth National Salvation Propaganda Corps' Rural Propaganda Team</h3>
<p>The Youth National Salvation Propaganda Corps, in view of the fact that the national salvation movement is only intense in urban areas and among the intellectual class, while in rural areas, it is silent. We have always claimed that our country is founded on agriculture, but without the support and assistance of the vast peasantry, how can we talk about saving the country or winning the war against Japan? Therefore, the Corps has compiled simple and vernacular picture books on national humiliation and promoting national spirit, and distributed them to counties for redistribution to rural areas, in order to encourage the people in the interior to jointly save the country from the national crisis. It has also specially dispatched Li Jianping, Shao Pengfei, Zhang Guohua, Sun Tianbai, and Zhu Chunlin to lead their respective teams to the Jinpu and Jinghu anti-Japanese front lines to conduct field inspections of the propaganda work in various counties and to liaise with local party headquarters to provide propaganda materials in the future.</p>

<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Students from various universities sent a telegram to Nanjing, which read: "To the Nanjing National Government, this time, all the students in Shanghai, because Tao Baichuan, Chen Xizeng and others disrupted the anti-Japanese national salvation movement, and kidnapped and beat students from Peking University and Central University, petitioned Mayor Zhang Yuejun to thoroughly investigate and punish them. Mayor Zhang ordered the arrest of Tao and Chen to be interrogated. However, Mayor Zhang, saddened by the depravity of the party headquarters and the deception of his subordinates, was so moved that he wanted to resign. We deeply regret this. Mayor Zhang has expressed deep sympathy and sincerity for this movement of our association, and he is one of the rare senior officials under your government. Therefore, we specially send a telegram to urge you to retain him and encourage him to continue to work hard for the anti-Japanese national salvation. We are fortunate. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of Students from various universities in Shanghai bows."</p>

<h3>Ju Zheng Pays Respects to Tian Tong</h3>
<p>Ju Zheng and Tian Tong, two leading figures in the Hubei revolution, were known as close friends since childhood, with shared aspirations and a deep bond of friendship, lasting forty years as if it were a single day. Last spring, Ju was imprisoned for state affairs, and Tian made every effort to rescue him. Ju arrived in Shanghai last month while ill, but Tian had already passed away last autumn. Ju wished to pay his respects, but was confined by an illness. He went from the hospital to the countryside for recuperation, and has only recently recovered. Yesterday, he specially went with his younger brother, Huan, and friends Deng Yulin, Cai Dasheng, and others to pay his respects at the Hubei Guild Hall in a plain carriage with white horses, embodying the spirit of the ancients. Zhang Ming presented a wreath, and Ju knelt and bowed before the coffin with tears in his eyes. Tian Huan returned the salute in a ritual manner. At that time, the阴wind howled fiercely, and the atmosphere was悲痛and heartbreaking. Those who witnessed it were also moved.</p>

The prosecutor of the First Special Court verified that he died of lung disease and ordered the body to be collected. However, Lu's concubine, Lu Yinshi, hired lawyers Zheng Wenkai and Jiang Baoli to sue Zhou detective in the First Special District Court for seeking wealth and causing death, and using electric shock to torture Lu. The court has already summoned him once and ordered Zhou to pay 10,000 yuan for bail pending trial, as reported in this newspaper.

At that time, public bus No. 5015 was coming from the east. Liu saw the bus and wanted to retreat, but it was too late to avoid it. He was knocked down by the bus and seriously injured. Hua Bu No. 848, who was stationed at the spot, saw it and immediately sent Liu to the hospital for treatment. He died shortly after. The Yangshupu捕心reported the incident and ordered detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Feilun Road验尸所.

The driver, Wang Changhong, Gong stated that the deceased was running fast at first, but suddenly retreated. His car was driving very slowly and was honking the horn.

According to the testimony of Yang Jinlin and others, prosecutor Guo announced that the deceased, Liu Genshan, also known as Xu Genshan, was indeed injured and killed by public bus No. 15015. The corpse was handed over to Xu Wenfu to be taken back for burial.</p>

<h3>Student Strike, Suicide: Luo Dafan</h3>
<p>Since the violent Japanese occupation of the three northeastern provinces, patriotic sentiment has been high both inside and outside China. Student enthusiasm is even greater, with petitions, demonstrations, and propaganda occurring almost daily. This kind of patriotic spirit is a support for diplomacy and the soul of the nation, and is truly commendable. However, the all-too-frequent occurrence of student strikes, without weighing the importance of the matter, leaves the reporter pacing anxiously, unable to remain silent. In recent years, laborers around the world, oppressed by capitalism, have resorted to strikes as a weapon of resistance, aiming to harm the enemy (capitalists) and seek their own interests. Students have followed suit, often using strikes as a tool to resist all enemies, forming a habit that is difficult to reverse. This has led to a decline in the efficiency of school education, and the nation's plan for cultivating talent has also suffered a great blow. If this continues, it will be difficult to resist the invasion of the violent Japanese and to ensure the nation's eternal survival. The reporter has worked in education for many years and has witnessed the reasons for school strikes over the past two decades. These can be summarized as follows: (1) Regarding the students themselves, if their demands are not met, such as regarding curriculum, facilities, or poor teachers, they often resort to strikes as a last resort. (2) Regarding the school itself, if the school is reorganized, students may support or reject it based on emotions, and sometimes unscrupulous teachers use students to consolidate their positions. (3) Regarding domestic politics, in recent years, the political situation has been volatile, and disappointed dignitaries or ambitious politicians often take advantage of opportunities to incite student unrest as a means of overthrowing the government. (4) Regarding diplomacy, students have repeatedly used the weapon of strikes, and over time, they have become accustomed to it. Therefore, when foreign aggression occurs or negotiations fail, they also resort to strikes, believing that it can prompt the authorities to reflect. The response is universal, and they are not ashamed of it. Considering the above, it is well known that while workers' strikes against capitalists cause some damage to social production, they are not contradictory to the goal of maintaining their own interests. Students who strike due to their own interests may be able to compensate for their losses with the results they achieve. However, those who are used to maintain the positions of teachers or serve as sacrifices for ambitious individuals are losing the precious time of hundreds, thousands, or even millions of people, while the beneficiaries are only the rights of one or two private individuals, which has nothing to do with the students themselves. In retrospect, the students must regret their actions, realizing that they were not worthwhile. If the nation is in danger and a strong neighbor is rampant, it is the duty of soldiers to go to the front line to kill the enemy and defend the country. It is the responsibility of the people to do their best to support the army in terms of supplies and the transportation of weapons. As for students, in addition to making efforts to promote patriotism within a reasonable time, holding demonstrations to express public opinion, their main task should still be to intensify their studies in order to prepare to take on the important responsibility of saving the country in the future. The previous cart has overturned, so the following cart should be cautious. Accumulate strength and strive to make persistent efforts. This is the certain process of saving the country, and it is also the duty of each of us, which cannot be surpassed and must be chosen carefully. The diligence and efforts of our young students are enough to establish prestige and deter the enemy. Moreover, the Japanese invasion is happening without the need for any arrows or bullets, as if entering an uninhabited area. This is an unprecedented shame in our history, and anyone with blood in their veins would be heartbroken. The reporter believes that national salvation movements can be divided into different tasks and do not need to be forced. We should focus on practice and avoid empty rhetoric, understand the true situation of the enemy and ourselves, and consider the needs of the front line. Those who are eager to advance can organize volunteer armies and defend the country with weapons, which is commendable. Those who persevere can bury themselves in books and study the classics to develop grand strategies, which is also not blameworthy. Therefore, it is my opinion that young students should each follow their own aspirations and expand their abilities, without the need for a nationwide strike, but rather express their patriotism and loyalty in practice. If we endure hardship and bide our time, planning to destroy Wu in ten years, we can defeat the enemy without much effort. However, if we abandon our studies due to foreign aggression and place the fate of countless young people in the country on a single gamble, then we are abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial, and the soldiers will be defeated before the battle. Our morale will be weak, and our spirit will be empty. Moreover, our people are currently working hard to sever economic ties in order to resist the violent Japanese, so that Japan will suffer material losses and reduce its combat power. If our young students all engage in a long-term strike, then we will first suffer an incalculable spiritual loss, which is tantamount to using the weapon of strikes to commit suicide, causing no harm to the enemy and only benefiting them. The Japanese will laugh at us. I hope that our beloved millions of young students will carefully consider their choices, not be bound by old habits, and act rashly.</p>
<p>(Response: In various places, young people have held petitions, marches, and propaganda work related to diplomatic issues, resulting in strikes and even nationwide strikes. This is a heartbreaking matter. The news refers to it as "suicide," which is indeed the case. The purpose of suicide is to arouse the other party's awareness. If this effect cannot be achieved, is it not even more unjust? Ultimately, it is hoped that the government will not create reasons for strikes. Diplomatic policies should be based on public opinion, and all declarations must be substantial and long-lasting. Within the realm of possibility, we should do our best to inform the people of the changes in diplomacy and the difficulties in dealing with them. At the same time, public administration should be transparent, so that people have the opportunity to participate in politics and have freedom of assembly and speech. If we can do this, even if someone incites student unrest, they will find it difficult to do so, and there will be no need to do so. This is the only way to fundamentally solve the problem of student unrest.)</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor, I have read the news in your newspaper's local Shanghai news column yesterday, which stated that "Jiang Xueqian, a representative of Zhongda University, was injured in a beating." This is quite shocking. Upon investigation, Xueqian has not left the capital in recent days. The Anti-Japanese Association of our school does not have Xueqian participating, so there is no way for him to represent the association, let alone represent the association at a joint anti-Japanese conference of various universities in Shanghai, resulting in being beaten. The information in your newspaper is clearly a mistake in the name of another person. In addition to publishing a notice in various newspapers in the capital to clarify this, I am writing to you specifically to request a correction. To the Shenbao Newspaper Office, Jiang Xueqian, December 11th.</p>

<p>Book Reviews</p>
<h3>World Financial Situation (Continued) Edited by Zhu Binyuan of Nancin</h3>
<p>In the world financial market, the so-called gold price or silver price refers to the ratio between gold and silver. However, in countries with a gold standard, the fluctuations in silver are calculated based on the gold standard currency. The buying and selling of silver is no different from other commodities, so it can be said that there is only a silver price, and no so-called gold price. As for the extraordinary prevalence of copper subsidiary coins in our country's society, and the existence of a separate market price between them and the main currency, the silver price in the British and American financial markets has a dual meaning in our country's market. This is the so-called "gold-silver ratio." Here, the editor presents the situation of the past decade with accurate proportions, so that readers can understand the truth of the matter. In the present day of soaring gold prices and falling silver prices, this "gold-silver ratio" must be given importance.</p>
<p>International exchange is the most common means of clearing international debts, so the fluctuations in exchange rates are based on the changes in international lending relationships. There are many factors that create lending relationships, such as foreign trade, foreign debt principal and interest, freight, insurance, tariffs, overseas remittances from overseas Chinese, overseas business expenses, and salaries of foreign envoys. Of these, trade and foreign debt are the most important. The editor elaborates on this in the "Exchange Rate" section in an extremely clear manner.</p>
<p>Chapter Three: "Increases and Decreases in Cash Reserves and Paper Currency Circulation and Their Impact." Cash reserves and paper currency circulation describe the period when the European war was in full swing, when countries, in order to prevent cash outflows, declared a gold embargo on the one hand, and concentrated cash in the central bank or treasury on the other, resulting in a daily increase in reserves. After the war, the consolidation of the monetary system made this concentration even more necessary. Judging from the figures of the past decade, there has been a "soaring" trend. Secondly, there is the impact of the increase and decrease of gold reserves and paper currency on interest rates and prices, which is undoubtedly very detrimental to our country's market. Because when gold reserves change, the first thing that changes is the interest rate, followed by the exchange rate. When paper currency changes, the first thing that changes is the price of goods, followed by the exchange rate. China previously adopted the silver standard, so this point is also very important.</p>
<p>Chapter Four: "The Situation of Central Banks in Various Countries." This is very sufficient to provide reference for the study of banking. (1) The United States: Federal Reserve Bank (2) France: Bank of France. The biggest event in the financial aspect of France was the reform of the monetary system, because since the suspension of cash payments in the previous period, the value of the franc had plummeted. After much effort to rectify the situation, stability was restored in the previous year. (3) Germany: National Bank. Germany's economic situation was still good due to the favorable conditions of the year XX. After that, it gradually declined. Several industries raised domestic prices in order to reduce export prices, which greatly reduced the purchasing power of the domestic market. These all have the national bank's treasury. (4) Italy: Bank of Italy. (5) Japan: Bank of Japan. The editor has provided extremely detailed tables and explanations for these, which are very valuable for assistance.</p>
<p>Today's world is a world of economic competition. The rise and fall of national fortunes, the well-being of the people, and the prosperity of the country often depend on the strength of its economic power. Therefore, if we want to understand this point, we must first have a glimpse of the world's financial situation. Then, Mr. Zhu's book is worthy of our attention.</p>
<h3>The Purpose and Organization of the League of Nations by Gao Wei</h3>
<p>Translated and edited by Jiang Genyuan</p>
<p>This book collects all the materials on the League of Nations and narrates them in a concise style. We feel that although the League of Nations seems to be monopolized by ambitious people, we should not stand among the exploited masses and seek temporary peace. We must study the root cause and then prescribe the right medicine. As for this book's introduction to the League of Nations, it takes a completely faithful attitude. During this excitement about the Eastern Provinces Incident, everything is not discussed for the time being, but we will study its actual content, which is not without meaning.</p>
<p>This book is divided into four parts: Part 1: League of Nations Covenant, Part 2: Organization of the League of Nations, Part 3: Independent Organizations, and Part 4: Harmony, Continuity, and Development.</p>
<p>The first section discusses the interdependence of modern countries. We know that the fear of war among European countries has been deeply rooted in people's hearts since the 19th century. It was not until the Hague Conference in 1907 that the embryo of an organized system of national defense arbitration was produced, but it was destroyed by the tragedy of 1914. After the war, US President Wilson drafted a general outline of the League of Nations plan, as well as the peace treaty.</p>
