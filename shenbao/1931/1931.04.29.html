<h3>英法意恊定之難關</h3>
<p>英國調解法意協定成功之初各國報紙皆欣然稱爲世界和平之曙光以爲軍縮會議由是即可成功年來大戰復起之愁雲慘霧亦即可一掃而空此蓋世人渴望和平之心所同然也不意自三國專門委員會進行交涉而後即遇重大難關法國所提該條約之解釋英意覆文皆巳表示不同意於是數月來之努力勢將前功盡棄而各國報紙又不勝其悲觀矣然我則謂尚未遽至於悲觀也何也國際間重大問題其由成功而趨於决裂也决非一時意見之不合即可决裂必經若干次之反覆積若干不相容之意見挽無可挽而後乃至於决裂其由决裂而進於成功也亦然一時意見之偶合一部分隔閡之消釋亦不能遽謂爲成功必各方面幡然覺悟有堅决進行之誠意一致以全力赴此目的突破重重難關而不爲難關所阻限始能達於成功之境故前此英國調解法意之爭僅可謂一時之接近固不能遽視爲樂觀而今日英意之反對法國亦僅爲一時之隔閡而停頓蓋今日英意法之恊商雖暫告停頓而此後進行之機會正多各大國在此經濟支絀之情勢下欲求和平合作固不易然欲毅然决裂亦豈易言故此問題之結果尚非一時間所能縣測也</p>

<h3>致兒童敎育社社員討論兒童讀物的一封信吳研因</h3>
<p>應否用鳥言獸語的故事</p>
<p>此次兒童敎育社在滬舉行年會各情丶巳迭誌各報丶敎部吳研因君丶致該社社員討論兒童讀物的一封信丶吳君對於尚仲衣君在年會所講反對「用鳥言獸語的故事」的一點丶力持異議原函如下丶諸位同志丶年會以事忙丶未能出席爲憾丶頃讀上海各報（二十日）載尚仲衣先生在年會中所講的「選擇兒童讀物標準」丶很爲欽佩丶但有一小部分丶很覺疑慮丶所以在百忙中寫這信給諸位請諸位注意丶尚先生所說「選擇敎材可用合於自然勢力的事實或合於人類社會價值的故事丶」「不必用不合情理的神怪故事」丶這是我們夙昔所主張丶經尚先生一說丶而我們更確信的丶</p>
<p>但他斷定「低年級讀物……不用鳥言獸語」丶以爲鳥言獸語就是神怪丶並同情於所謂湖南省政府主席打破以鳥語獸言爲讀物的主張丶則未免令人疑惑萬分丶不合情理的神怪故事丶足引起兒童恐怖丶疑惑或迷信固然不可用但鳥言獸語是否就是神怪丶所謂神怪的界說究竟如何丶内容究竟如何丶</p>
<p>我以爲某敎科書所錄的所謂「瓦盆寃」丶活鬼出現丶這誠然是「怪」丶「二郎神捉孫行者」一類的故事丶也近乎所謂「神」丶但貓狗談話雅雀問答丶這一類的故事丶或本含敎訓丶或自述生活丶何神之有丶何怪之有呢丶</p>
<p>倘以爲鳥言獸語丶本無其事丶而讀物以無爲有丶這便是神怪丶那麽所謂神怪的範圍未免太大了丶以此類推丶不但「中山狼」等一類寓言丶都在打倒之列丶「大匠運斤」「公輸刻鳶」「愚公移山」……等故事丶也該銷燬丶就是湖南省政府主席所最崇奉的聖經賢傳也應大删特改丶因爲「介葛盧識牛鳴」公冶長知鳥語」見於左傳家語丶「齊人有一妻一妾」丶衆人舜官等丶也不見得不是「以無爲有」呀丶</p>
<p>凡是論斷丶應該列舉證明丶可惜尚先生所言丶未將實際的敎材舉出丶不知所謂「不用鳥言獸語」的範圍丶究竟何如丶</p>
<p>現在我提出如下的問題丶一何謂神怪故事丶二神怪故事是否應該以合情理不合情理爲取捨丶三鳥言獸語丶是否神怪而至於不合情理丶四此類故事敎學之結果丶究竟有何種流弊丶或竟毫無關係丶五尚先生所說鳥獸不言而專述動物生活的故事丶又是什麽丶</p>
<p>我想請諸同志在以後一年内把這間願試騐研究丶求出一個結果來下年度的年會就拿這些問題做討論的中心丶</p>
<p>最後我要鄭重聲明的丶我並不贊成「純粹神話」丶請看敎育部小學國語課程暫行標準關於敎材選擇的一句話丶「不取可怕而無寓意的純粹神話」丶我並望尚先生對我的疑慮丶加以解釋丶更望尚先生列舉他所謂合宜的具體敎材見示丶俾所觀摩丶專此敬頌進步吳研因四月二十一日丶</p>

<h3>一得之言</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>沙場凱旋。得意。情場凱旋。尤得意。而情場爲俘虜。更得意。</p>
<p>目爲智識之門。舌爲旤害之根。故人當少鼓其舌。而善張其目。</p>
<p>舌以柔存齒以堅折故君子處世宜柔不宜剛。。</p>
<p>老子曰。「專氣致柔能嬰兒」。專氣者。綿綿若存。用之不勤服氣延命之道也凡物之有生機者必柔。嬰兒肌理柔軟。生機盎然。迨至老年。去死日近肌理日硬熊經鳥伸。此致柔之道亦延命之道也</p>
<p>四十歲以前爲人生之本文自此以後。則爲其註釋而巳。本文固欲做得好。註釋亦斷斷不可成蛇足或狗尾也。</p>
<p>吾人之愉快。極爲簡短。其舊者遠者。更爲糢糊。宛如乘舟離岸。相距愈遠。岸上之景物愈糢糊。終於隱没不見。</p>
<p>乘船之人。見岸上之景物漸遠。而知船之進行。人與青年者相接。而後知巳之年老。亦猶是耳。</p>
<p>我欲的主觀世界。宛如舞臺之裝飾在幼穉時代。距離較遠。理相上以爲燦爛奪目者迨壯老時。近而觀之則覺襤褸不堪。令人欲嘔矣。</p>
<h3>凄凉刧後話龍巖</h3>
<p>— 羽</p>
<p>數年來湘贛閩等省所遭之赤禍。雖李闖張獻。亦無其殘酷。闖獻之爲禍。不過殺人而巳。一刀便巳算數而赤匪則有千奇百怪匪夷所思之殺人法。凡殺一人不。令其即死。務使受盡苦楚。宛轉哀號而後斃。我至友王體剛即不幸身罹其刦。遭鱗割之慘。至要求飲彈速死亦不可得。迄今言之猶覺心悸焉。體剛泰縣人也。爾時僅數十村淪爲匪區。殺人尚殘酷如此。矧湘贛諸省。動輒數十縣盡陷於匪手。任所欲爲乎。兹幸中央大舉剿辦。匪勢巳蹙。人民有來蘇之望。如閩西各縣。且以完全肅清聞矣。同鄉程君。服務於四十九師。克復龍巖時。隨軍進城。目擊一切景象。舉以函我。謂進城後。到處都是赤色。城南大街各商店屋宇。一律髹以紅漆。當是赤匪强人民爲之者。城西有橋名西興橋。亦全部漆成紅色。現軍隊令各商店改漆灰色西興橋則改漆黑色。可怖之紅色遂不復見西興橋頭有一賣糖菓老人。倖保殘生。仍作舊生涯。有詢之者渠謂去年夏季。赤匪恒成羣結隊。男女雜遝。裸浴於橋下。嬉笑謔浪無所不至。岸上人行過時。須視如不見。苟加注意。或笑。或作驚奇表示者立被拘殺。烏乎赤匪統治下之人民真螻蟻不啻也。按龍巖自十八年春。即爲赤匪盤踞。人民或播遷。或慘死。留者不及半。至爲凄凉云。</p>
<h3>醉白池品茗記</h3>
<p>— 青松居士</p>
<p>醉白池者。一我松之園林勝地也。在谷陽門外西南隅。距城二里而遥。西車站繚其左超果古刹繞其右。平田峙前。溪流縈後。其中亭館樓閣。爛若霞起。廣池盈畝。遍植荷蕖。題名曰醉白。志飛觴醉月之意。上巳之辰春暮矣。始往游焉。初如行城巿中。經二茅亭前。怪石嵯峨。漸有山氣而地悉曲徑幽澗。一回顧。竹樹蓊鬱雲烟蒸媚。乍高乍下。路一綫如齒豁紅塵起其中。即所來徑也。折而東。四面廳在焉。前並荷池。後臨雜樹。旁植木香薔薇夾竹桃諸卉引蔓覆蓋其上。花時追賞。璀璨若錦繡再行數十武。有堂巖巖。院中古槐一株蔥蘢矗鬱。直清霄。曲幹横枝。連青接黛。曦晨伏晝。不受日影。過此偃憩。樂不忘返。迤西則有亭翼然。名曰水月閣。三面臨水。軒爽絶倫。左則修竹千竿儼然屏障前則桃李芳菲。映若疏簾。旁有古柏一株。蚴蟉屈曲。横臥池上。霜皮香骨。尤爲奇絶。主其事者。乃就此地搆楹爲閣。陳設幽雅。顔曰臥柯軒蓋狀其勢頗奇特。而足供撫玩者也。余旣繞行一周。左顧右盼。乃藉水月閣而品茗。憑欄周矚。細浪文漪。涵清漾碧游鱗翔羽自相映帶。或有騷人墨客。焚香把卷。即景吟詩。或見人家美眷。倚欄垂釣。臨風舒腕顧盼自豪。并有雙雙情侣。情話喁喁。或覓幽會之所。或攝亭亭之影。笑話手招。此樂何極。然自余視之。春色滿園關不住。一枝紅杏出墻來。則未免俗而傷雅矣。旣而游人坌集。言哤人雜。雅不願與之同處。乃尋原徑而返。</p>
<h3>葉譽虎之風雅</h3>
<p>— 志政</p>
<p>交通界耆宿。現任國府中英庚欵委員會委員葉譽虎先生。風流儒雅藹然可親生平嗜古成癖前蘇州角直唐塑佛像之保管即由先生與諸名流所發起書法宗漢魏駸駸入古。人咸知先生於新學無所不窺。而不知先生於國學尤稱閎博。生平不輕易爲文。嘗見其輓劉母張夫人一聯云。「環佩極凄清。萬里瑶京仙魄逈。帷屏餘髣髴。三年閩海夢痕哀。」寫作俱登峯造極。得者視若拱璧云。</p>
<h3>說印泥</h3>
<p>— 今覺</p>
<p>漢唐璽印。多用封泥猶今之火漆耳。至油艾所製之泥。或云昉自宣和。或曰五代時巳有之當與刻書之用雕版同時發明逮明。末清初時。又盛行一種水印。水印者。以蜜和硃。代油之用。乍見鮮明。日久蜜性褪。則硃浮紙上。極易脫落。裝池家遇有水印之書畫。恒相戒格外注意。故不久旋廢棄不用。而油硃之泥。仍迄今沿用不衰惟品質優劣。萬有不齊。古法失傳。佳製日尠。基勒有成書者。僅乾隆時汪鎬京之紫泥法一卷。余讀其書。開卷即曰染砂。巳知其支離不足爲訓。蓋泥之爲色持砂之本質非持其染。砂而待染。則其爲砂也可知矣。近時巿上通行者。有日本漳州兩種。日製之劣者搗皮紙爲絨以代艾。殊不值識者一顧。然其高者。如天賞堂之所製。亦有每兩值日金一二十元者。漳製品第亦普通者多。聞其佳者。只某某兩家專製。並不設肆零沽。余曾從友人處求得少許。覺其色仍不免略帶橘黄。且有油硃不匀之弊。日本天賞堂之極品。硃細油匀矣。而光彩薄而不厚。且亦失之略黄。不能得原之正色。至某社所售之每兩十六元者。以民三四初出之品爲優。近來則漸不如前所製者。色澤帶紫。而質地深厚。日漳兩製。過黄過薄之弊。庶幾能免。然同一紫也。紫而鮮則可。紫而黯則不可。同一厚也。厚而匀則可。厚而粗則不可。求其砂細而不堆砌。油匀而不瀋暈。絨韌而不粘滯。而又色澤明豔。適合正赤者。三十年來除舊泥外。實未有所遇。余連年所收書畫不下五六百件。而無一自加收藏印章者實懼以劣泥損吾壤寳耳。今年以友人之介。得識夏子宜滋於惜隂書齋。與談製泥之法。則源流得失。剖析入微。蓋積二十餘年之經騐。而成專門名家矣。出其所製藕絲印泥。面試之。則所謂砂不堆砌。油不瀋暈。絨不粘滯之三德。無不畢具。而就燈光映視質地深潤而細膩匀鋪紙面。絶無邊厚中薄形如雙勾之病。其製品區分等級凡八。自二元以迄五十元。然大别則爲紅紫二類。所謂紫者。皆砂之本色。自然如此。絶非攙雜洋紅硃標之僞色可比。故能鮮豔而無浮光。深厚而無晦色。歷冬夏經水火而不變。此實製造上一大發明。亦藝林中一大快事。蓋此後書畫家鑒藏家於印泥一事。可以按圖索驥。不必如前此之暗中摸索耗巨金而購多種之試騐品。以冀倖獲一當而可不必得者也。夏子名其泥曰自怡。頗自矜秘。不輕示人。現徇友人之請公開應世世。或有疑吾言爲阿其所好或譽過其實者。則曷斥二元先購其最低級之一種。。試鈐之紙。以與每兩一二十金之漳日兩製一較其色澤。吾知此之下駟。或將超越彼之上駟。則其妙品神品之美更可知矣。鄭蘇堪先生新自析津歸。亦曾用自怡印泥者。余問其如何。則亦以並世無兩。足以嫓美内府秘製爲對。因相約爲詩以張之。余以印泥羗無故實。侔色揣稱。頗難著筆。爰率寫一律。以殿吾說泥之後。舊譜支離法可删。西清秘製落人間。乞從勾漏神仙鼎。奪盡臙脂婦女山。寸寸抝蓮絲易盡。番番題葉色同殷。芳名小璽鈐何處。押角花中露一斑。（不受酬）</p>

<h3>西湖息養社小住頗有所得錄寄瘦鵑以當小簡轉示同人</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>曲岸藏鶯。微波掠燕。畫船都載鴛鴦。六橋西去無樹不垂楊祇怪鈿車陌上怱怱地。催送斜陽。留不住偎花傍柳。浣女共漁郎。蒼茫烟水暮梵鐘幾杵又做昏黄。甚眉月梢頭還比人忙。才是朦龐半响無端又。過了東牆誰知道湖樓小住一日幾滄桑。（滿庭芳）</p>
<p>風柳吹棉湖蓴擁雪此景幾人曾見。偶携鴛侣踏莎行。泛紅船綠波清淺。白堤路短怎禁得飈輪一轉甚怱怱。把香車油壁。麵塵兜滿。雲林遠。何似扁舟。日傍閒庭院。冶游人似柳邊鶯。去還來。一雙雛燕。春風笑臉。渾不避陳思偷眼。待評量西子妝成誰靚（西子妝）</p>
<p>水眼嬌明。山眉顰黛。濃淡恰如郎意。暖風吹到艶如蘭。袒羅襟。兩峯雲氣。宵來睡足。任軃了雙　　理。嬾腰肢。是垂絲人柳。畫樓斜倚。惺忪未。儘許劉楨。默默含情視。畫橋圓鏡乍開奩。逗氤氲。粉香脂膩。水晶簾底料無計將儂廻避怪啼鵑。偏道不如歸矣。（西子妝）</p>

<h3>印度遊記（三八）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>二十四日晨五時天巳明。在車中見窗外樹木山水此地離伽耶Gaya巳不遠。又名菩提伽耶。乃佛成道之處。法華經云。我爲太子時。出家近拁耶。即是此地。乃佛敎第一名區也。尚隔數十里。山甚少。林木不少。土係沙質。火車向西行。南面時有小山。亦經小沙河。覺得似山東曲阜等處。不類江南也。植物棕蔗菜花。但覺得土地不肥。人烟不多。頗爲寥落。六時巳到伽耶。乃一小鎮。隨衆下車。過橋。暫住大乘佛會所建之休息所。Rest　House其地在車站之東南。不甚遠。房數間。斯門汀建。甚精雅。東邊有園。園有井。以桔橰打水余飲其水味亦可。門前馬路寛廣。大樹行列。特多塵土。往來者有回敎人婆羅門敎人。（即印度敎人）一大汽車滿裝多人聞有呼喊之聲。乃甘地之徒黨被捕。在車中呼喊也。所見人皆面黑。多畫額成五彩。蓋信神點額也。辛漢君同余游小鎮。鎮上售花果蔬菜甚多。白牛滿路。吾意中國無白牛最好有人回國帶二三對小白牛種去甚好。不過運費貴耳飯時辛漢君親供僧進食。衆僧列坐。人持一鉢。如中國之坐席然。辛漢君一一供。食僧坐而受。即十餘歲小僧亦然。本來席地盤坐後。不便於復起。但余殊不謂然。辛君英國畢業生博學能文。現主持全會事務十餘歲學徒之僧僅識之無。以儒敎論。小子當洒掃進退事。其長老不應習懶受人供養也不過佛敎重制度耳。</p>
<p>飯後雇馬車兩輛前行。詣伽耶道場可行兩點鐘。向南方而進途經小鎮。略如吾鄉僻巿。甚樸陋似山東不似江南近道塲處。大樹甚多傍沙河沙河尚流。不可行船。水甚清。經郵局不遠即到佛成道處之伽耶道場。下車有小舖賣糖食者。並無山。乃一小高坡耳。若以山水論。殊無足觀。萬不及無錫之惠山也下車處在東北口。西行即經過大塔之北。直往大乘佛會所。修之休息處此處建於二十年前。洋式房舍數十間。頗莊雅。凡全球各地人參佛者均可住。多見西藏人來。一見中國人。面目甚親。因西藏與中國同種。一望而知。印度人爲阿利安種也。上層樓住有中國僧。五台人。說中國話甚好。云來此禮佛一年餘。巳叩頭十餘萬。板上成脚印。尚須叩頭十餘萬。滿三十萬則回國云。</p>

<p>藝術界</p>
<h3>晨光藝展與中國的繪畫運動</h3>
<p>— 傅莉生</p>
<p>一·四月來的印象</p>
<p>二·現代繪畫的傾向</p>
<p>三·晨光的出品與中國社會生活</p>
<p>四·中國繪畫運動的發展</p>
<p>一·四月來的印象</p>
<p>二十年到了四月、我巳看過了白鵝畫展、新華畫展、岳崙彫刻個展、蒂賽畫社美展、藝苑第二次美展、及今日所參觀的晨光藝術會第五届展覽會六個藝術展覽會了、這些展覽會、給了我們一個什麽印象、在中國的藝術運動上、有了怎樣地一個關聯、這是值得我們研究藝術的人考究的、</p>
<p>岳崙彫刻個展所有的作品、在意識方面、自然是莫有一點表現而在技術方面是供戲了現代彫塑的新穎的傾向、岳崙彫刻個展、在中國是彫塑家的個展先聲、衝破了中國藝術界的一部分的沉悶、這是使我們研究藝術的人非常歡喜的而替中國的藝術前途祝福着、蒂賽畫社展覽會也是中國的圖案畫展、覽會的先聲、這對中國工藝的發展給了一個很好的象徵、而在其中的吳尚俊一幅廣告宣傳、取材於日人去蒙古墾殖、是非常難得的好作品、而他這傾向、是異樣地給了我們一個激極的宣傳的感覺、對於日本人生了很大的反感、白鵝畫展、新華畫展藝苑美展、是充分地表示了他們（那些美術家）是爲藝術而藝術、然而在色彩筆觸、取材、未有特别的變化、依然是與前四五年的美術一般形態一樣、而且有許多作家、反現出了退化的痕跡、例如潘玉良君底作品在十八年的第一次全國美展會中的作品是有很濃鬱的情感在流露、這也即是她底作品有生命、而在藝苑展覽會中的作品就莫有生命了、只是色彩和絲條畫成了那樣一個東西而巳、汪亞塵君的靜物、也没有他在個展中的秀麗可愛了、這幾個繪畫展覽會是非常地顯示了中國的繪畫運動在停頓着、而且是在退化着、可是今天（四月二十五日）的晨光藝術會第五届展覽會、給了我們非常好的、開了一個新紀元的現象了、</p>
<p>二　現代繪畫的傾向</p>
<p>現代繪畫的傾向、是非常地傾向在民衆方面來了、是非常地傾向在有民族意識的來了、原因是、藝術、並不是藝術家的靈魂的創造、藝術、並不是天才的表現而藝術更不是大自然的再現、在這些年頭兒、還有主張爲藝術而藝術、那是根本不懂得藝術與人生有很密切的關係而發出這種囈語的、</p>
<p>藝術、它是一民族精神的表現、它是一個時代的社會生活的反映、在歐西各國現在表現人類生活的新原始主義和新寫實主義代替、所以他們底每一幅每一幅作品、都傾向在人類的感情的動態方面來了、一幅畫是有一個人生在裏面、藝術它是發在人類生活中、所以它底材料、應該取在人類生活中、每一幅畫是應該有一個人生觀的反映了、換句話來講現代的繪畫、是巳經超脫出了大自然的境界中、而走向人類生活去了、</p>
<h3>英士紀念塔晨光第五届展覽會出品</h3>
<p>— 鄭兆甲作</p>
<p>我們根據這樣地一個原則來觀察晨光藝術會第五届展覽會的作品、我們非常地公認晨光藝術會諸君的作品是不與現時代背道而馳的了、在他們一百零五點的作品中大多是取材於人類的生活的</p>
<p>現代世界的畫壇、是傾向在人類生活來了、而我們中國的藝術展覽會只有晨光藝術會是這樣地供獻給我們、這是怎樣地在中國的藝術史上開了一個新紀元、</p>
<p>在這次晨光藝術會的供獻的作品、是非常地反映了中國的社會生活、現代的社會生活、</p>
<p>三　晨光的出品與中國社會生活</p>
<p>中國的社會情勢、現在還是非常紊亂、雖然、軍事期間過了、而是政治的建設時期、</p>
<p>中國現在還是受着帝國主義的欺凌、上海租界地方是充分地表現了他們（帝國主義）底暴力的蓄積、楊秋太君的「虹口所見」、正面畫着一個日本兵守着位後面即是營房、鐵甲車、這幅畫是此次作品中頗難得的一幅、</p>
<p>中國近幾年有好些地方有了天災、余再生君的「流離」、程甘君的「災民」是非常把有了天災地方的民衆的生活苦痛表現了出來的、其他如「流血」、「喚起」「工人會議」、「黄河曉渡」、「會師鄭州」也是與中國的革命有非常重大的關係、在楊秋太君的「喚起」、「羣衆」、而且正表現中國的民族是一天一天在興起了、黄振中君的「長沙印象」華後君的「赤色的恐怖」、非常地表現了一九三年和一九三一年紅匪的猖獗和共産的搗亂、其他如徐蘇靈君的「夜曲」、朱應鵬君的「舞女」、曾志良君的「小販、」「農民」、陸小霞君的「賣花」、都是反映了現代的中國社會生活的一般、</p>
<p>在他們的作品内容的傾向、是緊緊地接聯着社會生活如、果以這個展覽來與其他的展覽比較、便覺得如毅華、藝苑、白鵝藝術運動社（林風眠等）、是非常地落後了、而在晨光諸君的技術、也是非常表現了各個的特長、</p>
<p>四　中國繪畫運動的發展</p>
<p>中國的繪畫運動、在過去是非常表現了一個不好的現象、不在作品的意識求進步、、而只是在技術的講究、所有的作品、都找不出一點什麽意識出來、只見色彩與線條的痕跡、所以繪畫運動、没有什麽發展而停滯着、晨光藝術會、這次發了我們這次的展覽會、是誇張了中國繪畫運動、正在發展了、</p>
<p>過去的畫家、如徐悲鴻君的裸體描寫林風眠君的宗敎表現王濟遠君汪亞塵君的大自然的再現、都是他們没有社會生活的經騐、所以只默守在畫室中、以致中國的畫壇、成了一個僵局、而今的晨光諸君都是在革命時代政治工作的同志、所以他們的作品有了新的局面、這正是給了我們一個非常敎訓、美術家是不能離開政治生活、雖然不人人都要去幹政治生活、而應該對於社會生活是、要冷靜的目光去觀察、方能使繪畫運動不停頓着、</p>
<p>藝術的主潮是傾向在人生來了、爲藝術而藝術的畫家們、倘使你們再不轉變、時代會將你擯棄了、</p>
<p>中國繪畫運動在發展着、巳經跳出了象牙之塔了、</p>
<p>中國繪畫運動的發展、晨光藝術會在推動着、</p>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記續</h3>
<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>英軍對此計劃能做夠到何種程度、因爲他的軍事顧問不在、米爾納侯爵對克來孟梭君提出的這個問題不能即予客復、不過他提議在次日二十六日與英國將軍再召集會議一次、我們因在下午五時在孔碑分散、决定次日上午十一時在杜里會議、</p>
<p>次日三月二十五、海格總指揮在阿白維面交魏根將軍一件公文、他在公文裏聲明他的請求和主張、</p>
<p>他的請求目的是要「至少二十師法軍、横跨沙姆河、在亞眠之西、立刻集中、防禦德軍抄擊英軍、「這就等於决定把英軍的抵抗遷移到亞眠之西、他的主張在下面一句裏表示的明明白白、就是「英軍必須且戰且退和掩護海峽各港口、」</p>
<p>這是一個嚴重的决定、對於聯軍的利益未能完全保護、對於驚魂未定的英軍的軍心給一新打擊、</p>
<p>危急存亡的時機突然臨頭、兩總司令就遇着各對本國所負的責任、現在不幸而言中、每人所最關心的是保存他的軍隊、因此就向根據地撤退、以此最足以保護其本國的利益、對英軍呢這個方向就是海峽、對法軍呢就是巴黎和法國内部、各以爲這是當務之急、其結果就不免背道而馳、所謂援救鄰軍成爲一種附帶的責任了、</p>
<p>德軍作戰祇有一個目標、聯軍有二個、就是英軍爲港口而戰、法軍爲巴黎而戰、英法兩軍分頭作戰愈、隔愈遠、聯軍司令官趨向於他們軍隊的分離、這就是德軍作戰的主要目標、他們冒着萬險務使聯軍完全分裂、這種事變協約國政府應負大部分的責任、所以他們如不及早積極參與戰事、我們唯有束手待斃、他們必須明白的確定聯軍的利益實爲當務之急、他們必須設立一個统制戰地全軍的機關、以保障共同的利益和指揮聯合的實力、</p>
<p>星期日三月四日、下午三點鐘、在貝當將軍發出訓令認可他同海格總指揮分歧的意見之前、我巳自動的請見國務總理克萊孟梭君、向他條陳申請注意戰事的進化、我復爲說明應當立即實行的軍事佈置和言出令行指揮戰事機關的需要、否則聯軍作戰、準備不充足、設備不完全、指揮又不統一、前途定卜凶多吉少</p>
<p>他接了我的條陳、頭一句話就是「你不是見棄我罷、你、我同海格和貝當是同意了的、我又何能爲力、</p>
<p>我回答說、「不是、總統先生、我不是見棄你、但是我們各人應當負起自巳的責任、且不能再事磋跎了、這所以我上了這個條陳、」</p>
<p>我是法軍的參謀長、也是法政府的軍事顧問嚴重的事變層見疊出、慘敗迫在眉捷、我不能袖手旁觀、各人負起他的責任的時機巳到、最爲重要的是法政府要了解國務總理克萊孟梭君的愛國熱忱、他的超羣的動作、和他同貝當將軍或海格總指揮屢次的談話、不足爲聯軍維持久長艱難的戰事、要解决這個問題必須即刻設立一指揮機關、完全以指揮聯軍戰事爲唯一的職志、由聯盟國政府公推富有經騐能力及威望卓著充任、佐以適當參謀、且須向協約國政府負責、不如此則聯軍的戰爭終必由力分而弱歸於慘敗（未完）</p>

<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<p>Naval Grand Review</p>
<p>Began Yesterday</p>
<p>"Jiangxi" and "Yuzhang" Ships Have Completed Inspection</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>The naval grand review began on the 28th. At 2:00 PM, Chief Reviewer Chen Shaokuan, Reviewers Yang Qingzhen, and others, along with more than ten inspectors, took a small steamer from the Xiaguan naval wharf. They first went to the "Jiangxi" warship, where they verified the names of the officers. Then, they inspected the sailors' quarters and the engine room. Afterward, they ordered a fire drill and combat readiness exercises. Finally, Chen gave a speech, encouraging all officers and soldiers to work hard and serve the Party and the country. Next, they went to the "Yuzhang" warship, where they similarly verified the names of all officers and soldiers and inspected the various compartments of the ship. They then ordered a major exercise of offensive and defensive techniques and the launching of torpedoes. The results were excellent. It is scheduled to continue reviewing other military vessels on the 29th. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Chen Diaoyuan Vigorously Defends Against Impeachments</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>Chen Diaoyuan telegraphed Chairman Jiang on the 25th, stating: "Having received and understood the reply, I have investigated that the salt and rice taxes in Anhui Province were abolished long ago in accordance with your order. The inspection of ships by the Grain Administration has also been carried out at any time. These matters have been reported separately to the Executive Yuan for verification. The establishment of the military police inspection office was because the ports of Anqing and Tongling are located along the river, with people from all directions. Cases of trafficking in prohibited items were frequently discovered, and the office was tasked with strict investigation and prohibition in accordance with the law. Recently, the trial period has expired, and the results have been unsatisfactory. It was decided to abolish the office, and each public security bureau was ordered to be responsible for strict investigation. As for the collection of tobacco taxes, the issuance of tobacco licenses, and the forced cultivation of tobacco by the people, these are absolutely untrue. In areas in northern Anhui where bandits are rampant, if any poisonous plants are discovered, the counties are immediately ordered to eradicate them. Records are kept and can be re-examined. However, various parties have fabricated facts to confuse the hearing and cause concern. As Nanjing and Anhui are close, if personnel are sent to investigate, the truth will be revealed. I await orders in fear and trembling. I humbly ask for your careful consideration." (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Preparations for Signing the Three Legal Rights Agreements</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Requests Issuance of Full Powers</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>According to diplomatic circles, the Sino-British, Sino-American, and Sino-Brazilian legal rights issues are not far from the signing stage. Although the French side has not yet made a concrete statement, it is believed that if the British and Americans resolve the issues, the French will not hold a dissenting opinion alone. Currently, in addition to preparing the signing procedures, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to forward it to the National Government for the immediate issuance of full powers to sign the Sino-British, Sino-American, Sino-Brazilian, and Sino-French agreements to resolve the abolition of consular jurisdiction. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>Wu Chaoshu telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the recent results are very good and that a resolution can be reached simultaneously with the British. According to reliable official sources, the Sino-British and Sino-American issues can be concluded within a few days and will not be delayed. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Shigemitsu to Arrive in China Soon to Continue Discussions on Legal Rights Issues</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>According to diplomatic circles, Shigemitsu, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in China, is scheduled to depart on the 29th and arrive in Shanghai, and then in Nanjing, in about two days to discuss legal rights issues.

<p>Bandit Forces in Western Hubei Impoverished</p>
<p>Various Counties Holding Clearing Campaigns</p>
<h3>Hankou</h3>
<p>The General Headquarters Staff Office telegraphed on the 27th to all newspapers for their information: Since the bandit troops of He Long occupied Honghu in western Hubei for many years, they have been severely suppressed by our army in successive encirclements. The bandits suffered heavy losses and fled in a panic to Gongshi and Ouchi in southern Jiangxi. They were pursued and suppressed by our Hunan and Hubei armies, and then fled to Jinli, Shili, Cili, and other counties. Our Hunan and Hubei armies made repeated efforts to encircle and attack them from both sides, and the bandits were divided into several sections. Their strength was dissipated, and they were unable to form a battle formation. However, the bandits were extremely cunning and continued to do evil. A part of them fled to the area of Tiaoxiankou and Taohuashan. He Long himself led the remnants to the deep mountains of Wufeng and Hefeng counties, where they held on to the mountains and resisted stubbornly, hoping to put up a last-ditch fight. The Hunan and Hubei troops were ordered to make every effort to pursue them relentlessly, with the determination not to stop until they were wiped out. The bandits had no choice but to abandon He Wufeng and flee to Badong, cross the Yangtze River secretly, and disturb Zigui, Xingshan, Guiyuan, and other counties, hoping to flee to the border areas where Xiangfan and southern Shaanxi meet to avoid the army's encirclement. Unexpectedly, the bandit's tricks were seen through by our army. One part of the Sichuan army was transferred to go downstream, and the other part went upstream to attack them from above and below. The bandits moved very quickly and had already fled back to Guiyuan. The Hunan and Hubei armies turned to pursue and suppress the bandits. In Guiyuan and other counties, they were able to contact the bandits. Relying on the brave charge of our officers and soldiers, they successively captured more than 1,800 people, 422 guns, 254 knives and spears, and 94 flags. The bandits suffered this setback and successive casualties, and their strength was reduced by about two-thirds. They abandoned their armor and weapons and fled desperately to Yangpingji in northern Yuan'an and Donggong City in Nanzhang County. The bandits are now impoverished and in a state of panic, like birds startled by the twang of a bow, and it is difficult for them to survive for long. The General Headquarters has ordered the Hunan, Sichuan, and Hubei troops to pursue, block, and encircle the bandits on separate routes, and has offered a reward of 100,000 yuan for the capture of He Long alive. It has issued a notice to all armies to make concerted efforts to advance and suppress the bandits. The report of victory comes like snowflakes. It is expected that the accumulated bandits of several years can be wiped out soon. This is the fortune of the Party and the country, and the blessing of the people. As for the part of He Long's bandits who fled to Tiaoxiankou, Taohuashan, and other places, after being suppressed by the Hunan and Hubei armies, the remaining bandits scattered. The areas of Taohuashan and Gangqiao have been recovered successively in recent days. They are now cooperating with the counties to hold clearing campaigns and search for the remaining bandits. The bandits in Zhuhe, Bachikou, and Fengkou have also been painfully suppressed by the Hubei armies, and they have been successively recovered. The remnants fled into the Honghu port and tributaries to hide. Recently, the bandit troops of Duan Dechang were defeated near X溝咀. The remaining bandits in Honghu and other places are being searched. From this, the red bandits in western Hubei can be said to have come to an end. However, after the pain, we think of the suffering of our people. The government is also actively carrying out post-bandit relief, rescuing the dead and wounded, handling emergency relief, and pacifying refugees. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Hankou</h3>
<p>Guo Xun's three regiments, Fu, Yuan, and Yu, launched a fierce attack on Donggong City from Zhao Jiahe Gorge on the 26th. He Long led the remnant bandits to retreat to Xiao Jia Ai. Guo waited for the arrival of the various armies before launching a general attack. Fan Shisheng ordered Li Guizhong to lead a brigade to force Nanzhang and attack the bandits on the flank, and to suppress the remnant bandits who fled from northern Hubei to Nanzhang. The two brigades of Xiao Zhichu, Chen and Wang, jointly suppressed the remnant bandits on Longwang Mountain. Many bandits were killed in Wangjiadian, Wangjiaban, Guanyin Rock, and other places. Longwang Mountain has been captured, and the remnant bandits are still being pursued. Furthermore, the New 34th Division defeated the remnant bandits of Yin Chao in Wang City and is pursuing them towards Jigongling. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Difficulties of the Anglo-Franco-Italian Agreement</h3>
<p>When the British mediation of the Franco-Italian agreement was successful, newspapers in various countries gladly called it the dawn of world peace, believing that the disarmament conference could be successful as a result, and the clouds of war that have been looming for years could be swept away. This is because the hearts of people around the world yearn for peace. Unexpectedly, since the special committee of the three countries began negotiations, it has encountered major difficulties. The British and Italian replies to France's interpretation of the treaty have expressed disagreement. Thus, the efforts of several months are about to be in vain, and newspapers in various countries cannot help but be pessimistic. However, I say that there is no need to be pessimistic yet. Why? Major international issues, from success to breakdown, are by no means broken down by temporary disagreements. They must go through several reversals and accumulate several irreconcilable opinions before they cannot be saved and then break down. The same is true from breakdown to success. Temporary agreement of opinions and partial elimination of divisions cannot be said to be success. All parties must suddenly realize that they have the sincerity to proceed firmly, and work together with all their strength towards this goal, breaking through numerous difficulties without being hindered by the difficulties, before they can achieve success. Therefore, the previous British mediation of the Franco-Italian dispute can only be said to be a temporary rapprochement and cannot be viewed optimistically. Today, the British and Italian opposition to France is only a temporary division and stagnation. Today, although the British, Italian, and French negotiations have been temporarily suspended, there are many opportunities for future progress. It is not easy for major countries to seek peaceful cooperation in the current situation of economic exhaustion, but it is not easy to resolutely break down. Therefore, the outcome of this issue cannot be predicted in a short time.</p>

The facilities seen were astonishing. The entire Soviet Union is wholeheartedly working hard and tightening their belts, striving together on the road to construction. If their policies succeed, they will undoubtedly occupy an important position in the world economy. We should pay attention to our own country's construction efforts so as not to fall behind others. Rumors of the difficulties and destitution of the Soviet people are untrue. They do not seek mere sustenance, but instead use their surplus resources to develop domestic industries. Their spirit of construction is truly admirable. Jiang is scheduled to depart south in two or three days. Wang stated that his mission in returning home is to report on the conference situation and collect a small portion of specialized materials on the Eastern Route. He will return to Russia in about a month. The Sino-Russian conference is progressing smoothly. Mo, the plenipotentiary, was very welcomed on this trip to Russia.

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<p>British New Budget Proposal</p>
<p>Presented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the House of Commons</p>
<p>Proposed to Levy New Land Tax</p>
<p>The Conservative Party is Expected to Oppose</p>
<h3>Reuters, London, 27th</h3>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden, having recovered from a long illness, presented the budget proposal in the House of Commons today, stating that the regular income for the previous year was £775,895,000 and the regular expenditure was £732,341,000. Despite the year of exceptional economic depression, the British government was not only able to balance its expenses but also allocate £43,500,000 for debt repayment. However, after reorganizing the debt reduction fund, the previous year's deficit totaled £23,276,000. He will adopt measures to convert national debt and seek to offset part of the previous year's deficit from ordinary sources. He estimated that based on existing taxation, the income for this year (1931-1932) would be £766,000,000 and the expenditure would be £803,000,000. This shortfall will be compensated by non-recurring donations and temporary measures. He regards this budget proposal as a wartime budget proposal because it should deal with temporary events and should have temporary plans. Income tax will not be increased, but the previous method of paying in two installments will be changed to 75% on January 1st and 25% on July 1st. This measure will increase tax revenue by one quarter of income tax revenue this year, namely £10 million. As for the tax collection agencies, there will be changes to place all collection affairs under a unified jurisdiction, as recommended by the Royal Commission. The oil tax will be immediately increased from four pence to six pence per gallon, which can generate £7.5 million this year. During the Great War, the British government had £33 million under the New York US dollar exchange account to offset exchange rate fluctuations and assist in debt repayment. This amount has been maintained until now without reduction. However, due to the agreement of the League of Nations and the establishment of the International Clearing Bank, the situation has changed. The debts paid by France and Italy have been credited to the British US dollar account of the International Clearing Bank. Although the New York US dollar exchange account cannot be completely eliminated after one year of operation, the amount in the account is too large and it is possible to withdraw £20 million. The sales of new lightweight motorized bicycles have increased rapidly in Europe. In order to encourage the manufacture of these free vehicles, the government will reduce the tax on motorized bicycles with a capacity not exceeding 150cc, which was previously £1 10 shillings, to 15 shillings thereafter. In terms of statistical income and expenditure, the income of this budget proposal is approximately £803,500,000, and the expenditure is £803,366,000. It is hoped that the people of the country will cooperate to reduce unnecessary expenditures to avoid increasing taxes. He intends to propose a land valuation case. If implemented in the future, a tax of one penny per pound will be levied according to the capital value of the land. However, it will not be implemented this year because the land price matters will be stipulated to be completed within two years. Snowden's speech lasted one hour and nine minutes. Conservative Party leader Neville Chamberlain and Liberal Party leader George both rose to speak and congratulate Snowden on his great efforts. Neville Chamberlain said that there were several things in the budget proposal that were still acceptable, but there were several things that the Conservative Party could not agree to. George said that there was one thing that made him happy, namely the land value tax. When Mr. Shi mentioned the land tax as the most important item in his budget proposal, the government party cheered endlessly. Snowden stated that George's land tax plan, which involved valuation and taxation at the same time, was extremely difficult to implement. He advocated that the valuation matters must be completed before taxation, so it is planned to complete the valuation procedures within two years after the financial bill is passed. The House of Commons then adjourned.</p>
<h3>National Society, London, 27th</h3>
<p>The British new budget proposal was presented to the House of Commons this afternoon. Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden's speech was short due to his illness and only lasted one hour and ten minutes. The deficit in the budget proposal is proposed to be compensated by levying a new land tax and increasing the kerosene tax. The land tax rate is one penny per pound according to the estimated land price, and the kerosene tax is increased by two pennies. The Conservative Party is expected to vigorously oppose it because of the land tax, but it is hoped that it will be supported by the Liberal Party, because Lloyd George never intended to levy a land tax in 1920.</p>
<p>The Rebel Party on Madeira Island Has Been Dispersed</p>
<p>Land, Sea, and Air Forces Attack Simultaneously</p>
<h3>Reuters, Lisbon, 27th</h3>
<p>Portuguese government troops launched a simultaneous land, sea, and air attack on Madeira Island today, dispersing the rebels and capturing seventeen people. The rebels' radio station has been dismantled by government troops.</p>
<h3>National Society, Lisbon, 27th</h3>
<p>Government troops and rebels fought fiercely on Madeira Island today. After government troops landed from warships, they occupied the Funchal radio station. At that time, the rebels bombarded with machine guns, and the artillery fire was very fierce. Government troops had to retreat to the warships and landed from the north of the island again, but there are no confirmed reports, so the outcome is still unknown. There are various rumors that the rebels demanded that their lives be spared as a condition of surrender.</p>
<h3>National Society, Lisbon, 28th</h3>
<p>The Official Gazette stated that the Portuguese government navy suddenly landed yesterday and attacked the Funchal radio station, capturing 17 rebel soldiers, and then returned to the original ship. Afterwards, they exchanged artillery fire with the rebels and had aircraft assisting the government troops.</p>

<p>The Future of the Anglo-Franco-Italian Agreement Becomes Increasingly Dim</p>
<p>The Italian Reply Has Been Delivered to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>The French Cabinet Will Hold a Special Meeting</p>
<h3>National Society, Paris, 27th</h3>
<p>The French cabinet will convene a special meeting tomorrow to discuss the British reply on the naval issue. The details of the content of the reply have not been announced, but what is known is that Britain rejected the new French proposal and protested against the rumors spread from Paris that British diplomacy was the main cause of this dispute, because French newspapers rumored that British Foreign Secretary Henderson forgot the implied conditions of recognition by France when he rushed to Rome. Currently, French newspapers close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs say that this dispute is due to misunderstanding, while opposition newspapers say that French diplomacy has fallen into a passive position and should make renewed efforts, and are particularly angry at the tricks of British diplomatic policy.</p>
<h3>National Society, Paris, 27th</h3>
<p>Italy's reply to France's new proposal to salvage the naval agreement has now been delivered to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Its content is roughly the same as the British memorandum. Currently, French newspapers are still wantonly attacking the British memorandum, and extreme newspapers even demand that France immediately withdraw from the naval agreement.</p>
<h3>National Society, Rome, 27th</h3>
<p>According to the comments of newspapers close to the Italian government, Italy's attitude towards France's new proposal to salvage the naval coordination is likely to follow in Britain's footsteps and reject it. The foreign ministries of Britain and Italy are still in contact from time to time, so it is firmly believed that Britain's counter-proposal will be seconded by the Italian government. Britain's counter-proposal is that France should temporarily accept the draft naval agreement and revise it in 1935. However, France's attitude may be unwilling to be bound by this agreement, so the hope of coordination in the future is still unknown. The result will deepen the rift between Italy and France. French newspapers blame Italy for this, but Italy cannot be held responsible. Italian newspapers also consider it a great honor to be able to follow the same steps as Britain.</p>

<p>The Term of Office of the German President</p>
<p>There are Those Who Advocate That Hindenburg Be Permanently Appointed</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Berlin, 27th</h3>
<p>The German President is elected every seven years. The current president, Hindenburg's term expires next spring. The Nationalist Party has stated that a proposal will be submitted to the parliament to extend President Hindenburg's term, changing it to a lifetime term, or until Hindenburg voluntarily steps down. Public opinion pays great attention to this, and the people are particularly satisfied. If this becomes a reality, all the disturbances in next year's presidential election can be avoided. However, some newspapers say it is highly doubtful whether Hindenburg, being of advanced age, would be willing to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the country for a long time. The extreme newspapers, including the organ of the National Socialist Party, strongly attacked this move, demanding the immediate dismissal of the president, in order to allow a true nationalist to take office.</p>
<p>Major Dispute Arises Within German Cabinet</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 27th</p>
<p>Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Schiele, requested an increase in grain import tariffs to assist German farmers, thus causing another major dispute in the cabinet. Mr. Schiele and Minister of Labor, Mr. Stegerwald, took extreme positions, threatening to resign unless their proposals were passed. However, most of the cabinet members sided with Mr. Stegerwald, because increasing food import tariffs is inconsistent with the government's goal of reducing the cost of living for the people. Government parties such as the Social Democratic Party opposed Mr. Schiele's proposal. Only the farmers supported Mr. Schiele. Some say that Chancellor Brüning is extremely talented and has previously resolved various difficult problems with ease. Therefore, Brüning will definitely have a way to deal with this matter as well.</p>
<p>Japanese Authorities Arrest Left-Wing Elements on a Large Scale</p>
<h3>Reuters, Tokyo, 28th</h3>
<p>Reports state that the authorities have arrested left-wing elements of farmers' associations on a large scale in various places, with a total of about 1,000 people arrested. About one-third of them will be charged with disturbing the peace. The reason is that radicals have taken advantage of the increasingly difficult lives of farmers to incite them in order to achieve their goals. It is reported that among those arrested</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>are four university students, accused of secretly engaging in violent activities under the guise of anti-religious movements. Recently, two anti-religious movements were launched in Japan by left-wing elements, clearly based on Lenin's doctrine that religion is an opiate of the people. It is reported that two Japanese, recently returned from Moscow, organized an anti-religious federation. Another former Buddhist monk also organized an anti-religious federation, aiming to destroy all existing religions. However, freedom of religion is enshrined in the Japanese constitution. The police authorities have been unable to deal with these people. Now, they accuse these people of secretly engaging in violent activities under the guise of anti-religious movements and arrest them, obviously trying to use this as a solution.</p>

The total number of wounded and deceased listed in the table is 1,891. It is proposed to calculate an average of 30 yuan per person, requiring a total of more than 56,700 yuan. It is requested that the Ministry of Finance be ordered to allocate the full amount and hand it over to the Relief Committee to be supervised by the Henan Provincial Government for distribution to show sympathy.

<h3>Chiang Tso-pin's Inspection of Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Talks about the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan in Harbin</p>
<p>He Says Russia Practices Austerity to Build the Nation</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Envoy to Germany Chiang Tso-pin, who returned from an inspection of Soviet Russia, arrived in Harbin this afternoon (24th). Li Shaogeng, Acting Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Director Shen Ruilin, Chief of the Railway Police Shen Houhuan, Director of the Land Bureau Zang Qifang, Director of Education Zhou Tianfang, Director of the Telephone Bureau Xu Zhen, and others greeted him at the station. After Chiang got off the train, he stayed at the Grand Hotel. Many people visited him. In the evening at 7 o'clock, the leaders of various agencies in the Special District held a banquet at the Chinese Eastern Railway Club to receive him. Chiang visited Harbin for one day and went south on the 25th. It is said that he will stay in Liaoning for one day before taking the Korean Maru to Shanghai on the 29th. I visited Chiang at the hotel. According to Chiang, "I arrived in Moscow on March 17 to inspect the Soviet Union's five-year economic plan as ordered. On the 16th of this month, I set off from Russia to return to China. When I first arrived in Soviet Russia, I was received by the Supreme Committee of the Five-Year Economic Implementation Plan, who explained how they must implement this policy and how to implement the method. After I got a general idea, they sent personnel to guide me to inspect various regions. The Soviet Union's five-year economic plan is implemented in five regions: the central region is Moscow, the eastern region is Ulan-Ude, the western region is Ukraine, the southern region is the Caucasus, and the northern region is Leningrad. I have visited Leningrad, Ukraine, and the Caucasus three regions one after another. As a result of the investigation, Russia's economic plan is indeed amazing. There are eight words that can summarize its situation, namely, "practice austerity, build the country and start a business." From top to bottom, the whole country saves on food and clothing and works hard to achieve the success of their plan. For example, the Caucasus is close to the tropics and is rich in fruits. Taking oranges as an example, each one sells for 3.5 yuan in the country, but only sells for 0.15 yuan when shipped abroad. The people are unwilling to eat them in order to ship them abroad and exchange them for cash. Their sales targets are the United States and Germany. Also, many German machines have been purchased. The reason why they work so hard is that the environment forces them to do so. Because the Soviet Union's doctrine and policy are regarded as a thorn in the side by countries all over the world, they always want to overthrow the Soviet Union. If they do not abandon their policy, they must compromise with others. The only way out if they do not compromise is to improve their own position. Therefore, people in the government call and warn their people all day long, saying that capitalist imperialists are preparing to destroy their country. All domestic businessmen have been overthrown, saying that businessmen are just a special class in society and cannot produce. They only handle affairs for others. There is no need for these people, so they are forced to change into workers. At present, state-owned farms, collective farms, metallurgical factories, coal factories, kerosene factories, and cotton factories in the Soviet Union all need workers. I still feel that there is a shortage of workers, so skilled workers living in Germany and the United States are being recalled. I inspected Russia for a whole month. I cannot finish the details in a few words. I once said to Russian dignitaries that China's situation is the same as that of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's doctrine is envied by various countries, and they want to overthrow it. China is coveted by various countries because of its large land and abundant resources, and they want to divide it up. The Soviet Union is working hard to improve its own position, and China is also working hard to find a way out." (24th)</p>
<h3>Panchen Lama Scheduled to Enter Beijing</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: After the Panchen Erdeni arrived in Shenyang on the 11th, he prepared to enter Beijing. Now that all the preparations have been completed, he is scheduled to depart from Shenyang with Chief of Staff and Member of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission Luo Sangnangjia, and staff member Jin Xiaoben, etc., within a few days. There are about 200 people in the entourage. Each day, various princes from Mongolia who came to Shenyang are also preparing to enter Beijing with the Panchen Lama. The Panchen Lama has telegraphed the Ministry of Railways and the Beijing-Ning Railroad Bureau to negotiate for vehicles, estimating the need for one saloon car, three first-class sleeping cars, four second-class cars, five third-class cars, and one baggage car. It is said that the princes from Mongolia who came to Shenyang are to assist the Panchen Lama in entering Tibet. A few days ago, the princes jointly telegraphed the central government, saying that Kangzang is an important part of our country's territory and is related to national defense. Although the Dalai Lama outwardly inclines to the central government, in reality, he is treacherous and conspires to collude with the British and invade the territory of Xikang Province. The situation is urgent. They earnestly request assistance to the Panchen Lama to return to Tibet and sit in the western border to preserve China's territory. According to Panchen Lama's Chief of Staff Luo Sangnangjia, when the Panchen Lama came to Shenyang last year, he originally planned to enter Beijing, but it did not happen due to an incident in the north. Now that the civil war is settled and the overall situation is unified, the Dalai Lama of the former Tibet has also sent representatives to Beijing. At this time, we can seek a peaceful solution to the Tibetan issue. As for the purpose of entering Beijing, it is only to consolidate the western border territory, save the Tibetan people from their predicament, support the revival of religion, and prevent the ambition of foreigners to invade, in order to restore the old friendship between the Han and Tibetan peoples and to achieve the realization of the entire five-ethnic republic. Currently, the National Government and various dignitaries attach great importance to the Tibetan issue and deeply hope that the Panchen Lama will arrive in Beijing as soon as possible. The National Government's Councilor's Office, the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission, and the Panchen Lama's Beijing Office are preparing to welcome him. My purpose in coming here is to report to the Panchen Lama on the situation in Beijing and to welcome him on behalf of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission. (25th)</p>
<h3>Han's Sun and Cao Divisions Exchange Defense</h3>
<p>Ma Hongkui Leaves Jinan and Returns to Tai'an</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Ma Hongkui, Commander-in-Chief of the 15th Route Army, was invited by Han Fuju on the 24th to come to Jinan to negotiate on bandit suppression and defense issues. Now that Ma's affairs are over, he left Jinan at 5:10 pm today (26th) and returned to Tai'an for defense. Because he left in a hurry, no dignitaries came to the station to see him off. Even four of the adjutants he brought did not have time to return south with the train. Han Fuju yesterday ordered the 20th Division of Sun Tongxuan, stationed in Jinan, to exchange defense with the 29th Division of Cao Fulin, stationed in Qingzhou and other places. The Commander-in-Chief's Office has sent a letter to the Jiaoji Railway requesting the allocation of four empty trains for transportation. The Jiaoji Railway has prepared two trains of 500 tons each today and handed them over to the Third Route Army for use. The remaining two trains will also be allocated within a few days. It is also reported that the bandits in the Quangu Mountain area of southern Shandong will be completely eliminated. Jia Benjia, the regimental commander of the 1st Regiment of the Handgun Brigade of Lei Taiping, left Tengxian at 5 pm today with the 2nd and 3rd battalions of his regiment and returned to Jinan.

The Party Department scheduled the 14th and 15th for voting, while the agricultural, industrial, commercial, and educational sectors scheduled the 15th, 16th, and 17th for voting. The deadline for reporting to the province was the 19th, and late reports would not be valid. Beforehand, the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government each sent a large number of committee members to various counties to guide the election. Provincial Party Department committee members Zhang Jiong, Tan Changkai, Wang Qi, and others personally went to various counties to inspect once. The Provincial Government summoned the county magistrates of various counties to the province to discuss the election procedures in person to show caution. Therefore, the election in various counties throughout the province went very smoothly. As of the evening of the 24th, 50 counties out of the 75 counties in the province reported the election results. The Provincial Office worked overnight to summarize the votes and officially announced them today. The names of the elected persons in each group are as follows: (Farmers' Association) Yin Deyang, Liu Baoshu, Yan Youfu, Zhang Jianxuan, Deng Xun, Zhou Anhan (Labor Union) Liang Guodong, Ling Xinxin, Zhong Ling, Cheng Xiwen, Bin Bucheng, Liu Yuehou (Chamber of Commerce and Industrial Associations) Chen Zhengyan, Shi Yongnian, Wan Guojun, Cao Bojin, Zeng Yuyun, Yang Shaoyun (Educational Association, Hunan University, and Freelance Professional Groups) Yu Shaoxun, Chen Jieshi, Fang Kegang, Lei Zhuhuan, Xiang Yujie, Luo Chuanju (Chinese Nationalist Party) Wang Qi, Tan Changkai, Zhang Jiong, Zeng Shengzhai. Among the elected persons above, Yin Deyang is the Director of the Hunan Electrical Administration Bureau, Deng Xun is the Principal of the Provincial Agricultural School, Zhang Jianxuan is the Secretary of the Central Construction Committee, Zhong Ling is the Director of the Hunan Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Bureau, Cheng Xiwen is the Principal of the Provincial Industrial School, Liu Yuehou is the Director of the Provincial Highway Bureau, Yu Shaoxun is a section chief of the Department of Education, Xiang Yujie is a supervisor of the Provincial Bank, and Luo Chuanju is a staff member of the Department of Education. He Jian originally planned to tour Pingjiang today (25th), but because the representatives are scheduled to leave for Beijing on the 28th, it was temporarily suspended. He is scheduled to hold a banquet tomorrow to entertain the representatives and report the situation in Hunan Province to the representatives so that they can understand the situation in the province. After the representatives leave, he will schedule a time to go to Pingjiang for inspection. (25th)</p>
<h3>After the Discovery of the Changsha Customs Corruption Case</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After the discovery of the Changsha Customs Dike Construction Surtax Embezzlement Case, He Jian immediately detained Yang Ren, the collection director of the customs, and telegraphed Hubei Province to send personnel to co-handle the case, and reported the situation to the Ministry of Finance. The matter was handled with great fanfare and caused a sensation for a while. Unexpectedly, something unexpected happened, that is, the main culprit Yang Ren suddenly colluded with Chen Ciyu (the chief of the general affairs section of the customs), the acting supervisor of the customs, and absconded. It is said that the Provincial Government has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the Changsha Customs Supervisor Mao Zhongcai be ordered to return to Hunan immediately to investigate and arrest the criminals and recover the embezzled funds. The details of Yang and Chen's absconding and the current investigation situation are reported below:</p>
<h3>The Course of Yang's Escape</h3>
<p>After the case was discovered, He Jian sent a guard team to take Yang Ren to the provincial government for detention. At that time, there were those who believed that because Changsha Customs was a direct subordinate agency of the Ministry of Finance, the method of punishment should be instructed by the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, in the telegram to the Ministry of Finance, there was a statement ordering the supervisor's office to take care of Yang Ren's custody first. The next day (13th), He was on tour in Liuyang and the criminal was returned to Changsha Customs for custody by the Provincial Government. Chen Ciyu (the chief of the customs section), the acting supervisor of the customs, and Yang were both from Fujian. It is common knowledge that they embezzled more than 200,000 yuan, and the relationship was not limited to Yang Ren alone. Yang then colluded with Chen Ciyu to abscond. It is also said that Wang Dajin, the accountant who issued a bribe ticket of 4,000 yuan, and others involved in the case have also left.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Customs Affairs</h3>
<p>Customs Supervisor Mao Zhongcai had originally requested a hundred days of leave to return to Fujian for mourning. Now he has returned to Shanghai from Fujian. Since Chen Ciyu absconded with Yang Ren, there was no one to preside over the customs affairs, and it almost came to a standstill. Later, the customs telegraphed the situation to Mao and requested instructions. A reply was received, approving his return to Hunan within a few days to preside over everything and investigate the case. Before he arrived in Hunan, the customs affairs were temporarily maintained by Section Chief Shi of the Customs Affairs Section. Therefore, Section Chief Shi is now responsible for the administration of the customs, and Section Chief Chen of the Audit Section is still responsible for the finances. However, the General Affairs Section has been vacant since Chen Ciyu left. It is reported that the General Affairs Section is most closely related to the corruption case.</p>
<h3>Investigation Situation</h3>
<p>After the Hubei Provincial Government received the telegram from Hunan Province, discovering the Yang Ren embezzlement case, it sent Liu Dejun, the dike donation supervisor of Changyue Customs, to Hunan to co-handle the case. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance also telegraphed Li Fengyao, Director of the Hunan Shore Transportation Bureau, to thoroughly investigate the case. Director Li immediately sent Zhu Yaonan, the chief of the second section of the bureau, to the customs for a thorough investigation. He has learned the general situation of the inside story of the case, but because the person in charge has escaped, he does not have complete certainty. (24th)</p>
<h3>Financial Straits in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Chen Pei-kun Goes to Xiamen to Negotiate Loans</p>
<p>He Gonggan Proceeds with Issuing Treasury Bonds</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Chen Pei-kun returned to the provincial capital from Xiamen yesterday. It is widely rumored that Chen had secured a loan of 200,000 yuan for financial problems. Upon hearing this news, accountants from various government agencies rushed to the provincial government on the 22nd to petition for the disbursement of administrative expenses. The provincial government, however, considered Chen's trip to Xiamen as not entirely successful. Nevertheless, they acknowledged the urgent need for funds for various agencies. Therefore, a temporary meeting was convened at the provincial government at 3 PM that afternoon. Attendees included Yang Shuzhuang, Zheng Baojing, Lin Ruyuan, Cheng Shihui, He Gonggan, and Jiang Pingfan, among others. They engaged in detailed discussions on ways to relieve the financial crisis. The outcome of the meeting is yet unknown.</p>
<p>According to a source, Chen Pei-kun did secure a loan of 200,000 yuan during his trip to Xiamen. However, the finance department had previously borrowed 180,000 yuan from Xiamen merchants, which has now matured. Therefore, only 20,000 yuan would remain after repaying the 180,000 yuan. In addition, funds collected from other sources amount to no more than 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Faced with financial difficulties, the finance department is issuing 500,000 yuan in short-term Fujian Province treasury bonds. From the 150,000 yuan in central government subsidies each month, 55,000 yuan is allocated to the Bank of China as a bond fund. These short-term treasury bonds have already been printed and the finance department is dispatching staff to encourage subscription. Salt merchants are expected to subscribe 100,000 yuan and liquor and tobacco merchants are expected to subscribe 30,000 yuan. He Gonggan is also writing to the relevant authorities to ensure proper handling. As for the 60,000 yuan in term notes due on the 20th of this month, the finance department has made various efforts to raise funds and hopes to honor them today. As for the term notes at various money houses, 120,000 yuan due on the 25th and 200,000 yuan due on the 30th are also approaching. It seems that the former finance department is still facing challenges. (April 24)</p>
<h3>Fujian and Jiangxi Armies Join Forces to Suppress Fang Zhimin</h3>
<p>Qian and Lin Brigades Recapture Shangxia Mei</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Communist bandits in the Jiangxi border area have repeatedly infiltrated Pucheng and Chongan in northern Fujian from Guangfeng and Qianshan. They were repelled by the provincial defense forces, namely the Qian Yuguang Brigade and the Marine Corps Lin Bingzhou Brigade. Recently, a group of over 700 led by Fang Zhimin invaded Shangmei and Xiasiamei in Chongan County, colluding with local bandits. They amassed over 2,000 people and established a base camp on the border between Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, engaging in extensive looting. The Qian Brigade immediately dispatched the Jiang Zhaoqi and Zhang Chunguang regiments in separate directions to suppress them. The bandits initially relied on the terrain to resist stubbornly. Subsequently, Lin Bingzhou led Wei Duo's regiment from Jianyang to Chongan to join the battle, encircling the bandits from three sides. After over 100 bandits were killed, Fang abandoned Xiasiamei and retreated to Shangmei. Government troops pursued victoriously, using machine guns and mountain guns for intense bombardment, causing more casualties among the bandits. Unable to hold their ground, they abandoned Shangmei and fled towards Tai'an on the Jiangxi border, with only about 300 remaining, in a very disheveled state. Currently, the Hu Brigade and Tang Regiment of the Jiangxi army have arrived at Kengkou on the border and have telegraphed the Fujian army to jointly attack Tai'an, so that Fang's bandits will be attacked from both sides and annihilated as soon as possible to eliminate future troubles. However, the Shangxia Mei area has been raided three times by bandits, leaving the villages in ruins. A small number of people were coerced into becoming bandits, while the majority fled to other places, afraid to return home. Therefore, although the area has been recovered, the scene is still very desolate. Recently, Lin Bingzhou and Lin Jinan, a member of the provincial government committee inspecting the bandit disaster in Chongan, held a meeting to propose four measures for post-disaster relief: 1. Gather the displaced people back to their hometown and provide them with farm tools and seeds from the government to quickly start spring plowing. 2. Launch a purge to investigate household registration and implement joint security to eliminate hidden bandits among the people. 3. Encourage villages to organize defense corps, with civilians purchasing firearms and the government subsidizing ammunition for self-defense. 4. Organize propaganda teams to lecture in various villages about the crimes of the Communist bandits to awaken the people. These measures have been submitted to the provincial government for approval. However, the Chongan Association of Fellow Provincials in the provincial capital yesterday elected representatives to petition the provincial government, requesting that the Qian Brigade be transferred and the Lin Brigade be deployed to ensure effective defense and suppression. The provincial government has ordered the Security Department to review and handle the matter. (April 24)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Subsidies for Zhejiang Province's Administrative Expenses</h3>
<p>Monthly Allocation of 150,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Limited to This Fiscal Year</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the likin abolition in Zhejiang, although strict austerity measures have been implemented, the new budget still falls short by seven to eight million yuan, resulting in significant arrears in administrative and educational expenses in recent months. At the beginning of the month, when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek visited Hangzhou, Zhang Nanxian and Wang Chengying personally presented the financial difficulties of Zhejiang Province and requested some subsidies from the central government to cope with the situation. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek agreed to find a solution after returning to Nanjing. Yesterday, the provincial government received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the requested allocation of funds to subsidize Zhejiang Province's administrative expenses would be approved, starting with 150,000 yuan per month from the first month of the 20th fiscal year, totaling 1.8 million yuan per year, to be allocated monthly by the ministry. The arrangement is limited to the 20th fiscal year, and the arrangements for the 21st fiscal year will be determined separately. With this substantial subsidy, Zhejiang Province will have sufficient funds to cover its administrative expenses. If the business tax is handled effectively, the new budget should be able to achieve a balance between income and expenditure.</p>

<h3>Refugees Behaving Like Bandits</h3>
<p>A few days ago, over three hundred refugees, passing through Baihejiang to Zhaotunqiao, detoured south to Hujiaqiao. At Ma Yushu's house, they robbed over thirty yuan in silver currency, over one hundred yuan in paper money, a gold ring, and forty-seven single coins. Subsequently, they went to Ma Yangchun's house, robbing over ten yuan in silver, a gold ring, as well as cured meat, fresh eggs, and white rice, etc., and then left triumphantly.</p>

<h3>A Large Number of Gamblers Found Not Suspected of Banditry</h3>
<p>In Yu Huai, Fengjing Township, there have been recent incidents of gambling gatherings. The local garrison, upon receiving the report, suspected that such gatherings during the anti-banditry period might have other motives. They immediately proceeded to arrest nine male and female gamblers. Yesterday, they were escorted to Songjiang. After investigation by the Anti-Banditry Command of the Four Counties, no major suspicion was found, and local people went to the command to testify on their behalf. They were all released together.</p>
<h3>Refugees from Other Provinces Arrive at Deshenggang</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chief Shen of the Huayangqiao Police Station of the Fourth Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau received a report that a large number of refugees, numbering eight or nine hundred, had arrived at Deshenggang, causing disorder and appearing to be moving forward.

<h3>Police and Bandits Exchange Fire at Maoqi Port</h3>
<p>Since the past few days, incidents of banditry and kidnapping have been occurring frequently in various townships of the county. After Mr. Shen, the chief of the Third District of the Water Police, was appointed temporary commander of Taihu Lake by the order of the department, he telegraphed the Seventh and Eighth Squads of the Muduo and Dongshan districts and all the squads in this district on the 27th to rush to Taihu Lake to conduct a large-scale joint suppression. After receiving the order, the Seventh and Eighth Squads led patrol boats under the command of Squad Leaders Li and Wang to cruise and search in areas such as Nan She on the opposite shore of Maoqi Port in Taihu Lake. At around 8 PM, over ten patrol boats of the Seventh and Eighth Squads suddenly encountered four bandit boats coming from the Nan She area. The patrol boats immediately surrounded them for suppression. However, the bandits, seeing the police coming to surround them, immediately opened fire. The water police also fired back. After an exchange of fire for over twenty minutes, the bandits, outmatched, fled back the way they came. That night, a report was sent from Dongshan to the county. Yesterday morning (28th), Cai Yu, the captain of the Third Police Detachment of the County Police, led a team of boats to Dongshan to assist Squad Leader Wang Wusheng of the Eighth Squad. In addition, Captain Pei of the Eleventh Water Police Squad led four patrol boats to block the Chefang Hujiadang area on the evening of the 27th. At around 1 AM yesterday morning, they encountered two bandit boats and dispersed them. The bandits fled into Taihu Lake. Furthermore, after receiving orders from Chief Shen, all the water police squads concentrated on the 28th to block and defend the South Taihu area. The escort ships Zhenwei and Peirong were deployed to block the key passes and carry out the encirclement in order to achieve complete annihilation in one fell swoop.</p>

<h3>Another Burglary Reported at Zhangjing Bridge</h3>
<p>There have been frequent reports of burglaries in the northern countryside of Wuxi County recently. Lianjie incidents occurred in Xujialong and Lijiatang, near Zhangjing Bridge in the Seventh District, on the night of the 25th, but no arrests have been reported so far. Furthermore, at Gu Rongjin's house in Zhanhetou, about three miles from Zhangjing Bridge, at about 2 AM the day before yesterday, over ten bandits with white cloths wrapped around their heads, armed with knives, clubs, and flashlights, broke down the door and entered. The Gu family was fast asleep and unable to escape. The bandits beat them and forced them to reveal the location of the silver, and stabbed Rongjin in the left ear twice. They robbed over 120 yuan in silver, one tael of silver, and dozens of pieces of clothing, worth about 500 to 600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gamblers in Baidu Port Assault Police and Resist Arrest</h3>
<p>The Second Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau outside the South Gate received a report that a man surnamed Jiang, from Jiangbei, was running a gambling den in Baidu Port. They immediately dispatched police to investigate and arrest them. However, the gamblers dared to assault the police and resist arrest, causing serious injuries to Police Officer Shan Desheng's waist and other parts of his body. The other police officers reported to Bureau Chief Wang, who led armed police to the scene and brought the five gamblers, Yuan Shouxiang, Yuan Jinguan, Zhao Qingsheng, Chen Wangshi, and Xu Heshi, back to the bureau, transferred them to the general bureau, and sent them to the county court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The County Government Organizes a Temporary Court</h3>
<p>The High Court previously received an instruction from the Ministry of Judicial Administration stating that, henceforth, all criminals arrested in each county for crimes endangering the Republic of China, such as disturbing public order, secretly colluding with foreign countries to disrupt public order, colluding with traitors to disrupt public order, inciting soldiers to disobey discipline, abandon their duties, or collude with traitors, using written words, drawings, or speeches to promote treasonous propaganda, sabotaging transportation, purchasing or transporting military supplies for traitors, harboring traitors without reporting them, and leaking political or military secrets to traitors, should be tried by the respective counties. Each county should organize a temporary court, with the county magistrate as the presiding judge. Judicial officers should be temporarily appointed by the High Court from the judges of the subordinate district courts. The judicial officers of the temporary court in this county have been appointed as judges Jiang Shuzhi and Huang Luzhao of the Wuxian District Court. President Lin has instructed County Magistrate Pan of this county that, from March 1st, whenever any of the above-mentioned criminals who endanger the Republic of China are arrested, the county magistrate may directly notify the respective judges to organize a temporary court to try them according to law.</p>
<h3>Sock Industry Workers Launch a Major Petition</h3>
<p>In this county, the sock industry's wage cuts have involved labor-management agreements, leading to disputes. The county government convened a meeting between both parties to mediate. However, Ge Ziqi, the executive director of the Sock Industry Association, sent a letter to the Sock Industry Workers' Union, denying the agreed-upon labor-management agreement and the resolutions of the county government's mediation meeting. After receiving the letter, the union convened a meeting of about 200 workers at 2 PM yesterday to discuss countermeasures. When the county party headquarters received the news, they immediately sent Lin Burong to the meeting for investigation. Xie Bin, from the workers' organizations' guidance office, also attended. Both gave earnest speeches. After the meeting, the workers went to the county party headquarters and the county government to petition for the immediate arrest and strict punishment of Ge Ziqi and the immediate implementation of the original agreement. They were received by the members of the county party committee, Li Yang and Wei Pu, as well as the county magistrate, Pan Zhongjia, who accepted all points of the petition and promised to handle them impartially immediately. The workers left satisfied.</p>

<h3>County Magistrate Li's Resignation Not Approved</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Li Leng of Jiangyin has been in office for nearly a year since taking over on May 5th of last year. Recently, due to various reasons, he has been harboring intentions of resigning. On the 25th, he personally went to the province to resign to Chairman Ye.

<h3>Departmental Committee's Report on the Giant Land Case Submitted</h3>
<p>A local, Huang Bingying, reported to the provincial department the case of Yang Bingwei, the former chief of the detective team, embezzling a giant land certificate. Wu Zezhong, an inspection committee member of the Civil Affairs Department, came to Cheng to conduct a secret investigation first, followed by a public inquiry. After gaining a clear understanding of the case, he reported the situation to the Civil Affairs Department. According to provincial sources, most of the points reported by Huang Bingying in this case were true. However, the division of profits can only be clarified when Yang Bingwei is brought to justice. It is difficult to excuse the county magistrate for his negligence and lack of supervision.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang Trade Associations Issue Declaration on Business Tax</h3>
<p>Because the regulations for the business tax in Jiangsu Province have not yet gone through legal procedures, the provincial government has set a date to start collecting, and the heavy tax rate is sufficient to hinder the development of commerce. The joint council previously decided to issue a declaration to implement the proposals of the chambers of commerce in various counties, districts, and towns. The declaration was issued yesterday, and is recorded below. The likin system plagued the people for nearly a hundred years. Our national government resolutely abolished it with the aim of alleviating the suffering of the people, and the whole country applauded it. To compensate for the local governments' loss of income, the business tax was introduced, and merchants deeply understood the difficulties of the provincial government and unanimously supported it. However, inland commerce is declining and small-scale. In the early stages of legislation, a slight carelessness would lead to the recurrence of the likin system and put commerce to death. The representatives of the chambers of commerce in various counties, districts, and towns have repeatedly gathered to petition. In summary, there are three main points: 1. The tax rate must not violate the provisions of the departmental guidelines, and must not exceed two per thousand at most, in order to uphold the rule of law and prevent the arbitrary imposition of exorbitant taxes in the future. 2. The tax rate and the starting date of collection must not differ from Shanghai, so as not to hinder the development of inland commerce. 3. The actual situation of each industry should be used as a reference to avoid causing conflicts and disturbances with the business community. In addition to protecting their own interests, they have never disregarded the progress of the provincial government and the income of the provincial treasury. At this time, the Central Political Council decided that the business tax should not disturb the people or hinder the development of commerce, which shows that what the merchants hoped for was already in the consideration of the central government. After hearing this, we were deeply impressed. However, the provincial government, regardless of whether the collection method is in line with the principles set by this meeting of the Central Political Council, intends to implement the collection on April 1st, and without considering that the loss of tax revenue due to the abolition of likin in the entire province, including the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, is only over 1.4 million, it is necessary to triple the amount to compensate from the merchants in the inland areas of Jiangsu, and they are not allowed to receive the same treatment as Shanghai. This is equivalent to catching fish in a deep pond and trapping birds in a forest. Inland commerce not only has no hope of development, but will also fall into a place of no return. In order to respect the central government's laws and regulations, in order to reduce the suffering of merchants, and in order to preserve the future tax sources of the provincial government, we swear to uphold the common proposals of the chambers of commerce in all counties, districts, and towns of the province, and we swear not to recognize the notification of collection starting on April 1st. Respectfully announced by the trade associations of the timber industry, paint industry, flower mat cotton industry, transportation industry, woolen sewing industry, pharmaceutical industry, printing industry, book industry, vehicle industry, western medicine industry, Beijing and Guangzhou sundry goods industry, rice industry, paper industry, shoe and hat industry, tea industry, hardware industry, tea and food industry, silk satin and cloth head industry.</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<h3>A Letter to Members of the Children's Education Society Discussing Children's Literature by Wu Yan Yin</h3>
<p>Should Bird and Animal Language Stories Be Used?</p>
<p>The recent annual meeting of the Children's Education Society in Shanghai and related matters have been reported in various newspapers. Wu Yan Yin of the Ministry of Education wrote a letter to the members of the society to discuss children's literature. Mr. Wu strongly disagreed with Mr. Shang Zhongyi's point made at the annual meeting against "the use of stories with bird and animal language." The original letter is as follows: Fellow comrades, I regret not being able to attend the annual meeting due to being busy. I recently read the "Standards for Selecting Children's Reading Materials" that Mr. Shang Zhongyi spoke about at the annual meeting (on the 20th) in various Shanghai newspapers and greatly admire it. However, there is a small part that I find very doubtful, so I am writing this letter to you in my busy schedule to ask for your attention. Mr. Shang said, "Materials should be selected from stories that are in line with the forces of nature or that are in line with the values of human society," and "unreasonable supernatural stories should not be used." This is what we have always advocated, and after Mr. Shang said it, we are even more convinced.</p>
<p>However, he asserted that "lower grade reading materials... should not use bird and animal language," thinking that bird and animal language is supernatural, and sympathized with the so-called Hunan Provincial Government Chairman's advocacy of abolishing bird and animal language as reading material, which is quite puzzling. Unreasonable supernatural stories that can cause children fear, doubt, or superstition are certainly not usable, but is bird and animal language supernatural? What is the definition of so-called supernatural, and what is its content?</p>
<p>I think the so-called "Injustice of the Earthen Pot" recorded in a certain textbook, where a living ghost appears, is indeed "strange," and stories like "Erlang Shen Capturing Sun Wukong" are also close to the so-called "divine." However, stories of cats and dogs talking, or sparrows asking questions, either contain lessons or describe life. Where is the divinity? Where is the strangeness?</p>
<p>If it is thought that bird and animal language is inherently non-existent, and reading materials treat non-existence as existence, then this is supernatural. Then the scope of the so-called supernatural is too large. By analogy, not only fables like "Mr. Zhongshan Wolf" should be abolished, but also stories like "The Skilled Craftsman Yun Jin," "Gongshu Carving a Kite," "The Old Man of the North Mountain Moving a Mountain," etc., should be destroyed. Even the Holy Scriptures and virtuous biographies that the Hunan Provincial Government Chairman most reveres should be greatly deleted and revised because "Jie Gelu Knows the Cow's Cry" and "Gongye Chang Knows the Language of Birds" are found in Zuo Zhuan Jia Yu, and "A Qi Person Has One Wife and One Concubine," and Zhongren Shun Guan, etc., may not be "treating non-existence as existence."</p>
<p>All arguments should list evidence, but unfortunately, Mr. Shang's statement did not provide examples of actual teaching materials. I do not know what the scope of the so-called "not using bird and animal language" is.</p>
<p>Now I raise the following questions: 1. What are supernatural stories? 2. Should supernatural stories be judged by whether they are reasonable or unreasonable? 3. Is bird and animal language supernatural and therefore unreasonable? 4. What are the consequences of teaching such stories? Or is there no relationship at all? 5. What are the stories that Mr. Shang mentioned that do not use bird and animal language but only describe animal life?</p>
<p>I would like to ask all comrades to try to experiment and research on this issue within the next year and find a result to use these questions as the center of discussion at next year's annual meeting.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to solemnly declare that I do not approve of "pure mythology." Please see the sentence in the Ministry of Education's provisional standards for the selection of materials for elementary school Chinese language courses: "Do not take terrible and meaningless pure mythology." I also hope that Mr. Shang will explain my doubts and list the specific teaching materials that he considers appropriate for me to see and learn from. Respectfully wishing progress, Wu Yan Yin, April 21st.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Expansion of Rural and Urban Elementary Schools</h3>
<p>In order to enrich the number of students in rural elementary schools and promote elementary school education in prosperous cities, the Ministry of Education has specially stipulated two methods and yesterday issued an order to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to instruct their subordinates to comply. The order stated, "Considering the recent situation of primary education in our country, the number of rural schools is relatively small, and the number of students is often insufficient. In prosperous cities, there are many students, and although there are more schools than in rural areas, they still cannot accommodate the majority of school-age children, which is the opposite of the situation in rural areas. In order to strive for remediation, two methods have been specially formulated: the 'Methods for Enriching the Number of Students in Rural Elementary Schools' and the 'Methods for Promoting Elementary School Education in Prosperous Cities.' This order is hereby issued to your department and bureau, and you are instructed to earnestly comply and instruct your subordinates to comply as well. This order."</p>
<h3>Methods for Enriching the Number of Students in Rural Elementary Schools</h3>
<p>1.  The number of students in rural elementary schools shall not be less than 25 per classroom, unless there are special circumstances and permission has been obtained from the competent education administrative agency. If the number of students is insufficient, measures should be taken to supplement it. 2. Rural elementary school principals and teachers should persuade the people nearby to promptly send their school-age children to school. 3. In order to cope with special circumstances, rural elementary schools may request enthusiastic education personnel outside the school to serve as volunteer enrollment committee members for the school to investigate school-age children within one kilometer around the school and urge them to enroll. 4. When the number of students in rural elementary schools is insufficient, no private schools for children over the age of nine shall be established within one kilometer nearby. If there are schools that affect school enrollment, the principal may submit a request to the competent education administrative agency to order them to close. 5. If two or more rural elementary schools have nearby school buildings and the number of students cannot be supplemented, the competent education administrative agency may consider merging the schools or grades. 6. Rural elementary schools may reduce the dates of summer or annual holidays and appropriately release agricultural busy season holidays. The period shall be determined by the local education administrative agency. 7. In order to reduce the burden on the people and make it easier for their children to enroll, rural elementary schools should set up more free places. The competent education administrative agency may provide books and supplies or purchase books and supplies for poor children to borrow. 8. Rural elementary schools should set up remedial classes to enroll out-of-school children over the age of ten for remedial study. 9. If this method is not suitable for a particular local situation, the local education administrative agency may formulate another method and submit it to the supervising education administrative agency for approval and report it to the Ministry of Education for record.</p>
<h3>Methods for Promoting Elementary School Education in Prosperous Cities</h3>
<p>(1) All elementary schools in populous cities that are insufficient to accommodate the local school-age children should be promoted as much as possible in accordance with these methods.

(4) The education administrative agencies of various cities may request the competent government to advise private individuals who build large houses in the city to build elementary school buildings according to the minimum standards for elementary school buildings at the time of construction so that public and private elementary schools can rent school buildings. The minimum standards for elementary school buildings shall be formulated by the education administrative agency of each city, together with the public works agency, and submitted to the competent government for approval and sent to the Ministry of Education for record. The private construction mentioned above shall be based on the principle of building one classroom of elementary school buildings for every 50 households. (5) Education administrative agencies in various cities should refer to the following methods to broadly raise funds for elementary schools, reduce waste, B. Reduce the agency's administrative expenses, C. Consider consolidating or reducing the size of middle schools and above that are already established but not very necessary, and gradually reduce their expenses. D. Submit a request to the competent government for designated funds, E. Appropriately increase tuition fees based on the ability of children's families, F. Other (7) The number of children in each grade of existing elementary schools may be expanded to 50. (8) Grades with insufficient enrollment numbers in existing elementary schools should consider using composite or two-part systems. Schools with more than two schools that have insufficient enrollment numbers may be merged. (9) Existing elementary school kindergartens and lower grades should consider adopting half-day school systems in the morning and afternoon in order to enroll more school-age children. (10) The competent education administrative agency should distribute children in existing elementary schools to various elementary schools in the district according to the address of the enrolling children in all city school districts. Do not allow children who live near School A to attend School B, or children who live near School B to attend School A. The number of children in each school should also be adjusted to avoid any imbalance. (11) When elementary schools enroll new students, the education administrative agency may jointly form an enrollment committee with the teachers of elementary schools in each school district to preside over the children's entrance examinations and allocate the admitted students evenly to each elementary school. (12) Existing elementary schools may set a reserve quota in addition to the regular admissions when enrolling new students. If there are vacancies in the regular students within two months of the start of school, they should be filled at any time. (13) If there are vacancies in each grade of existing elementary schools within half a semester after the start of the school year, they should still be admitted if there are applicants for transfer. (14) Existing public and private middle schools in the city should be encouraged to save costs and set up elementary schools. (15) Persuade various business groups and labor unions to donate funds to build private elementary schools. (16) Reward private individuals for establishing elementary schools. (17) Rectify private schools in the territory, train teachers, and improve private schools to be substitute elementary schools.

<h3>One-Sided Views</h3>
<p>— Holding to Buddha</p>
<p>Victorious on the battlefield, one is pleased. Victorious in the field of love, one is even more pleased. But to be a captive in the field of love is the most pleasing of all.</p>
<p>The eyes are the gateway to knowledge. The tongue is the root of disaster. Therefore, one should speak less and observe more.</p>
<p>The tongue survives through softness, while teeth break through hardness. Therefore, a gentleman should be soft, not rigid, in his dealings with the world.</p>
<p>Lao Tzu said, "Concentrating one's breath to achieve gentleness is like being an infant." Concentrating one's breath means that the breath is continuous, as if it exists, and using it without fatigue is the way to nourish one's breath and prolong life. All things with vitality are soft. An infant's muscles are soft and full of vitality. As one grows old, nearing death, the muscles become harder day by day. Stretching like a bear and extending like a bird, this way of achieving gentleness is also a way to prolong life.</p>
<p>Before the age of forty, life is like the main text. After that, it is like its commentary. The main text should be done well, but the commentary must not become a superfluous appendage or a dog's tail.</p>
<p>Our joy is extremely short-lived. The older and more distant it is, the more blurred it becomes, just like being on a boat leaving the shore. The farther away, the more blurred the scenery on the shore becomes, until it disappears completely.</p>
<p>A person on a boat sees the scenery on the shore receding and knows that the boat is moving. One associates with young people and then knows that one is old. It is just like this.</p>
<p>My desired subjective world is like the decoration of a stage. In childhood, when viewed from a distance, it seems brilliant and dazzling. But when one is old, and views it up close, it feels tattered and unbearable, making one want to vomit.</p>
<h3>A Tragic Tale of Longyan After the Calamity</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>In recent years, the red calamity suffered by the provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian has been more cruel than that of Li Chuang and Zhang Xian. The harm done by Chuang and Xian was only killing people. One cut and it was over. But the Red bandits have all kinds of strange and inconceivable ways of killing people. When killing a person, they do not let them die immediately, but make them suffer all kinds of torments, writhe in pain and wail before they die. My close friend, Wang Tigang, unfortunately suffered this calamity, suffering the misery of being cut to pieces. Even asking to be shot dead was not possible. Even now, speaking of it, I still feel frightened. Tigang was from Taixian. At that time, only a few dozen villages were reduced to bandit areas, and the killing was already so cruel. How much more so in Hunan and Jiangxi, where dozens of counties were often completely lost to the bandits, who did whatever they wanted? Fortunately, the central government launched a large-scale campaign to suppress the bandits, and their power has been weakened. The people have hope of recovery. The counties in western Fujian, for example, have been completely cleared. My fellow villager, Mr. Cheng, who serves in the 49th Division, entered the city with the army when Longyan was recovered. He witnessed everything and wrote to me. He said that after entering the city, everything was red. The shops and houses on the main street in the south of the city were all painted with red paint. This must have been done by the Red bandits who forced the people to do it. There is a bridge in the west of the city called Xixing Bridge, which was also painted entirely in red. Now the army has ordered the shops to repaint them in gray, and the Xixing Bridge to repaint in black. The terrifying red color is no longer seen. At the head of Xixing Bridge is an old man selling candy. He was fortunate enough to survive and is still doing his old business. When asked, he said that last summer, the Red bandits were always in groups, men and women mixed together, bathing naked under the bridge, laughing and joking without restraint. When people on the shore passed by, they had to pretend not to see them. If anyone paid attention, or laughed, or showed surprise, they would be arrested and killed immediately. Alas, the people under the rule of the Red bandits were truly no better than ants. According to reports, Longyan has been occupied by the Red bandits since the spring of the 18th year. The people either moved away or died tragically. Less than half remained. It was extremely desolate.</p>
<h3>A Record of Tea Tasting at Zui Bai Chi</h3>
<p>— Qing Song Resident</p>
<p>Zui Bai Chi is a scenic spot in the gardens of Songjiang. It is located in the southwest corner outside Guyang Gate, two li from the city. West Railway Station winds around its left and the ancient Chao Guo Temple encircles its right. Flat fields stand in front and streams meander behind. Among them, pavilions, buildings, and towers are as splendid as the rising glow of dawn. The wide pond is over an acre in size and is planted with lotus flowers everywhere. It is named Zui Bai, with the intention of expressing the joy of flying cups and drunken moonlight. On the day of Shangsi Festival, late in spring, I first went to visit. At first, it was like walking in the city. Passing through two thatched pavilions, the strange rocks are craggy and gradually there is a mountain atmosphere. The ground is full of winding paths and secluded streams. Looking back, the bamboo and trees are lush, the clouds and mist are steaming and charming, sometimes high and sometimes low. The road is a line like the teeth of a comb, and red dust rises in it. This is the path I came from. Turning east, the Four Sides Hall is there. In front is a lotus pond, and behind are various trees. Beside it are planted honeysuckle, roses, oleander, and other flowers, with vines covering it. When the flowers are in bloom, it is as brilliant as brocade when admired. Walking a few dozen steps further, there is a towering hall. In the courtyard is an ancient pagoda tree, lush and verdant, standing straight up to the clear sky. Its curved trunk and horizontal branches are connected to the blue and black. Morning and day, it is not affected by the sun's rays. Resting here, one forgets to return. To the west, there is a pavilion with wings, called Shui Yue Ge (Water Moon Pavilion). Three sides face the water, and the veranda is exceptionally refreshing. To the left are thousands of stalks of tall bamboo, like a screen. In front are peach and plum blossoms, reflecting like a sparse curtain. Beside it is an ancient cypress tree, twisting and turning, lying horizontally on the pond. Its frosty bark and fragrant bones are particularly wonderful. The person in charge of this place built a pavilion here, with elegant furnishings, and named it Wo Ke Xuan (Lying Branch Pavilion), describing its peculiar shape, which is sufficient for caressing and admiration. After I circled around once, looking left and right, I borrowed the Shui Yue Ge to taste tea. Leaning on the railing and looking around, the fine waves are rippling and the water is clear and green. Swimming fish and flying wings complement each other. Sometimes there are poets and scholars burning incense and holding scrolls, composing poems inspired by the scenery. Or one sees beautiful women from families leaning on the railings, fishing, stretching their wrists in the breeze, and looking around proudly. There are also couples whispering sweet nothings, either looking for a secluded place for a tryst or taking pictures of their graceful figures, laughing and beckoning. This joy is limitless. However, from my point of view, "Spring colors fill the garden, but a branch of red apricot extends over the wall" is inevitably vulgar and hurts the elegance. Then, tourists gathered, and the voices were noisy and people were mixed. I was unwilling to be with them, so I looked for the original path and returned.</p>
<h3>The Elegance of Ye Yuhu</h3>
<p>— Zhi Zheng</p>
<p>A senior figure in the transportation sector, and the current member of the British Boxer Indemnity Committee of the National Government, Mr. Ye Yuhu, is elegant and refined, and amiable. Throughout his life, he has been addicted to antiquities. The preservation of the Tang Dynasty Buddha statue in Jiaozhi, Suzhou, was initiated by Mr. Ye and other celebrities. His calligraphy follows the Han and Wei dynasties, gradually entering antiquity. People all know that Mr. Ye has explored all aspects of new learning, but they do not know that Mr. Ye is also known for his extensive knowledge of national studies. Throughout his life, he does not write easily. I once saw a couplet he wrote for the late mother of Liu, Madam Zhang, which said, "The jade pendants are extremely desolate and clear. The immortal soul of the remote Jade Capital is far away. The curtains and screens still have lingering images. Three years of Minhai dream traces are sad." The writing is all at its peak, and those who obtain it regard it as a precious treasure.</p>
<h3>On Seal Ink</h3>
<p>— Jin Jue</p>
<p>The seals of the Han and Tang dynasties mostly used sealing clay, like modern sealing wax. As for the ink made of oil and moxa, some say it originated in the Xuanhe period, while others say it already existed in the Five Dynasties, and should have been invented at the same time as woodblock printing. By the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, a kind of water-based ink became popular. Water-based ink was made with honey and vermilion, instead of oil. It was bright when first applied, but after a long time, the honey would fade, and the vermilion would float on the paper, easily falling off. When mounters encountered books and paintings with water-based ink, they always warned each other to pay extra attention. Therefore, it was soon abandoned. Oil-based vermilion ink is still used today, but the quality varies greatly. The ancient method has been lost, and good products are becoming scarce. The only book with a complete record is Wang Haojing's "Purple Ink Method" from the Qianlong period. When I read his book, the first sentence was "dyeing sand." I already knew that it was fragmented and not worth learning from. The color of ink should hold the essence of sand, not hold its dye. If sand is waiting to be dyed, then it is clear that it is sand. Recently, the most popular inks on the market are Japanese and Zhangzhou inks. The inferior Japanese inks use mashed waste paper instead of moxa. Knowledgeable people do not even look at it. However, the high-quality ones, such as those made by Tenshodo, are worth one or twenty yen per tael. Most Zhangzhou inks are also ordinary. I heard that the best ones are made exclusively by certain families and are not sold in stores. I once obtained a small amount from a friend and felt that the color was still slightly orange-yellow and that the oil and vermilion were uneven. Tenshodo's best product had fine vermilion and even oil, but the luster was thin and not thick, and it also lacked the correct color of the original. As for the ones sold by a certain company for sixteen yuan per tael, the ones made in the early years of the Republic were better. Recently, they have gradually become inferior to the ones made before. The color is purplish, and the texture is deep. The defects of being too yellow and too thin in both the Japanese and Zhangzhou inks can be avoided. However, the same purple can be good or bad. Purple is good if it is fresh, but not if it is dull. The same thickness can be good or bad. Thick is good if it is even, but not if it is coarse. In the past thirty years, I have not encountered anything other than old ink that has fine sand that does not pile up, even oil that does not sink and halo, tough velvet that does not stick, and a bright color that is perfectly red. I have collected no fewer than five or six hundred pieces of calligraphy and painting every year, but I have never added a collector's seal to them, fearing that inferior ink would damage my treasures. This year, through the introduction of a friend, I met Xia Ziyi of Xiyin Shuzhai. When I talked to him about the method of making ink, he analyzed the sources, gains, and losses in detail. He has accumulated more than twenty years of experience and has become a specialized master. He took out the lotus silk ink he made and tested it. The three virtues of sand not piling up, oil not sinking and haloing, and velvet not sticking were all present. When viewed under the light, the texture was deep, moist, and fine, evenly spread on the paper, with no disease of being thick on the edges and thin in the middle, shaped like a double hook. His products are divided into eight grades, from two yuan to fifty yuan. Generally, they are divided into red and purple. The so-called purple is the natural color of the sand. It is absolutely not comparable to the fake color of adding foreign red or vermilion. Therefore, it can be bright without floating light and deep without dullness. It does not change through winter and summer, water and fire. This is truly a major invention in manufacturing and a great pleasure in the art world. From now on, calligraphers, painters, and collectors can follow the map for ink and do not have to grope in the dark as before, spending huge sums to buy various experimental products in the hope of luckily obtaining one that is suitable, but may not be necessary. Xia Ziyi named his ink "Self-Pleasing" and kept it quite secret, not easily showing it to others. Now, he has responded to the request of friends to publicly offer it to the world. If anyone doubts my words as being flattering to him or praising him excessively, then why not spend two yuan to buy the lowest grade of one kind and try to apply it to paper and compare its color with the Zhangzhou and Japanese inks that cost one or twenty gold taels per tael? I know that this inferior horse will surpass that superior horse, and the beauty of its wonderful and divine products will be even more evident. Mr. Zheng Sukan has just returned from Tianjin and has also used Self-Pleasing ink. I asked him how it was, and he replied that it was unparalleled in the world and could be compared to the secret recipes of the imperial court. So we agreed to write poems to promote it. I said that there was no real precedent for ink, and it was difficult to write about it by comparing colors. So I hastily wrote a poem to end my discussion of ink. The old recipes are fragmented and can be deleted. The secret recipes of the Western Qing have fallen into the world. I beg to take from the alchemist's cauldron of Gou Lou and steal all the rouge from the women's mountain. It is easy to twist lotus silk inch by inch. The colors of each stamped leaf are the same as vermilion. Where should I stamp the small seal of the fragrant name? A trace of dew in the corner flower. (No payment accepted)</p>

<h3>A Short Stay at the West Lake Rest Society, from Which I Gained Much, Recorded and Sent to Lean Heron as a Short Note to Share with Colleagues</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>The winding banks hide orioles, and gentle waves brush swallows. Painted boats all carry mandarin ducks. The six bridges west are lined with willows. I only blame the decorated carriages on the road for rushing, sending off the setting sun. Unable to keep the women washing clothes and the fishermen leaning on flowers and willows. The vast misty water and the evening bells sound several times, again turning into twilight. Even the crescent moon at the tip of the brow is busier than people. It is only a hazy moment, and then it passes over the east wall for no reason. Who knows that a short stay at the lake building is several vicissitudes a day? (Full Garden Fragrance)</p>
<p>The wind blows cotton from the willows, and the lake heart covers the snow. How many people have seen this scene? Occasionally, I take my mandarin duck couple to step on the grass, and a red boat floats on the clear green waves. The White Causeway is short. How can it withstand the turning of a storm wheel? How rushed, with fragrant carriages and oil walls, full of dust. Yunlin is far away. How can it be compared to a flat boat, leaning on a leisurely courtyard all day? Pleasure seekers are like orioles beside the willows, coming and going, a pair of young swallows. The spring breeze smiles. Don't avoid Chen Si stealing glances. To evaluate who is more beautiful, the West Lake makeup is complete. (West Lake Makeup)</p>
<p>The watery eyes are charming and bright. The mountain brows frown with green black, both light and dark are like love for all. The warm wind blows and is as beautiful as orchids. Expose the soft chest. Two peaks of clouds are gas. Coming home to sleep. Letting loose. Lazy waist. Silk willows are slanting in paintings. The painting hall is slanting. Slightly tipsy. Completely Liu Zhen. Silently contains sentiment. The painted bridge and round mirror suddenly open. Temptation. The crystal beaded curtain at the bottom. I will not go back. Crying cuckoo. I do not want it, I will go home. (West Lake Makeup)</p>
<p>Tender sun warms clothes, and soft wind blows catkins. It is right after the peony blossoms. Endured the Cold Food Festival. I would give up my sable coat for wine. I am afraid. The peach roots and oars. With the green plums, they were like beans. It was cold after storms. And I do not care. The rose shelves are gradually wrinkling red. A thick curtain is filled with water. I will wait. To the spring weather in summer. To do the weather yellow. Smiling clothes, piles. A cotton mesh is also available. But early look up the mountains. (Golden Bright Pond)</p>
<h3>Travels in India (38)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>On the 24th, at five o'clock in the morning, it was already light. From the train, I saw trees and mountains outside the window. This place is not far from Gaya, also known as Bodh Gaya, the place where the Buddha attained enlightenment. The Lotus Sutra says, "When I was a prince, I left home near Jia Ye." This is the place, the first famous area of Buddhism. Still dozens of miles away, there are very few mountains, but many trees. The soil is sandy. The train travels west. There are small mountains to the south from time to time. It feels like Qufu in Shandong. It is not like Jiangnan. The plants are palm, sugarcane, and rapeseed. But the land does not seem fertile. There are not many people. It is quite desolate. At six o'clock, we arrived at Gaya, a small town. We followed the crowd off the train, crossed a bridge, and temporarily stayed at the rest house built by the Mahayana Buddhist Association. The place is not far to the southeast of the station. It has several rooms built of cement, which are very elegant. There is a garden on the east side. The garden has a well. The water is drawn with a well sweep. I drank the water and it tasted okay. The road in front of the door is wide. There are rows of large trees. There is a lot of dust. Those who come and go are Muslims and Brahmins (i.e., Hindus). A large car was full of people. We heard shouting. It was Gandhi's followers being arrested. They were shouting in the car. The people I saw were all black-faced. Many had colorful paint on their foreheads, believing in gods. Xin Hanjun and I toured the small town. There were many flowers, fruits, and vegetables for sale in the town. White cattle filled the road. I think it would be best if there were no white cattle in China. It would be great if someone brought two or three pairs of white cattle back to China to breed, but the transportation costs would be expensive. At mealtime, Xin Hanjun personally provided food for the monks. The monks sat in rows, each holding a bowl, like a Chinese banquet. Xin Hanjun provided them one by one. The monks sat and received the food, even the young monks who were only ten years old or so. Originally, they sat cross-legged on the ground, which was inconvenient for getting up again. But I did not think so. Mr. Xin is a graduate of an English university, knowledgeable and eloquent. He is currently in charge of the affairs of the whole association. The monks who are apprentices, only ten years old or so, barely know how to read. According to Confucianism, young people should sweep and clean and do things. Their elders should not be lazy and receive offerings. However, Buddhism values ​​the system.</p>
<p>After the meal, we hired two horse-drawn carriages and proceeded to the Gaya Dojo, which takes two hours to reach. We proceeded southward, passing through a small town, roughly like a remote market in my hometown, very simple and crude, like Shandong, not like Jiangnan. Near the dojo, there are many large trees alongside the sandy river. The sandy river is still flowing and cannot be used for boating. The water is very clear. Passing the post office, we soon arrived at the Gaya Dojo, the place where the Buddha attained enlightenment. There are small shops selling candy and food. There are no mountains. It is just a small high slope. In terms of mountains and rivers, it is not worth seeing at all. It is far less than Huishan in Wuxi. The place to get off the bus is at the northeast entrance. Going west, we passed the north of the Great Pagoda and went straight to the rest house built by the Mahayana Buddhist Association. This place was built twenty years ago. There are dozens of Western-style houses, which are quite solemn and elegant. Anyone from all over the world who comes to worship the Buddha can stay. Many Tibetans come. When they see Chinese people, they look very friendly. Because Tibetans and Chinese are of the same race, it is easy to tell at a glance. The Indians are of the Aryan race. On the upper floor lives a Chinese monk from Wutai Mountain. He speaks Chinese very well. He said that he has been here to worship the Buddha for more than a year and has kowtowed more than 100,000 times. Footprints have formed on the board. He still has to kowtow more than 100,000 times. When he reaches 300,000, he will return to China.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<p>Financial Gold Prices Show Strength Again</p>
<h3>Market Situation: Rabbit Up, Falcon Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 28th, the gold standard rose again, but the rabbit went up and the falcon went down, and the trend was unstoppable. In short, people's hearts were confused. The total market accounted for more than eleven taels. Looking back, it finally rose by six taels. The previous market hovered around 730 taels, but the overseas silver market rose slightly and was not affected. At first, the gold buying was still stable, but as the foreign exchange turned from weak to strong and the listing price was lengthened by one level, the market situation turned from weak to strong. The later market once broke through the 740 tael mark, which was truly a swift move by the buyers. Moreover, the bills of exchange were even tighter. It was clear that there were both overt and covert buyers. Later, there seemed to be many sellers, and it fell slightly. However, the situation was still stable, and it was unlikely to fall sharply. This morning, the price could fall slightly.</p>
<h3>Pondering and Looking Around in the Morning</h3>
<p>From the opening of the market at the beginning of June, it rose slightly by two cents to 732 taels. The price of silver increased by one-eighth, and the price of silver increased by one-quarter. The private telegrams were also the same. Then, Gan Changxiang, Heng Yu, goods and other items all came to buy, and the price rose from 31 and a half to 4 taels. The British gold was bought by banks such as the Zhongri Bank for 625, and then Dadetcheng, Yongfeng, and others sold it, and they all knew that the first order could be lengthened, so it fell by a small 3 taels, totaling 32 taels. The announcement of the first order was indeed 25 U.S. cents and 5 cents, and the price of gold fell by 2 minutes and 75, at 31 taels. However, Changsheng, Yongjuchang, and others bought in, and the price rose by 2 taels, totaling 33 taels. Then, the downstream, because Yu Da, Zhifeng Yong, Yuanyuan Mao Yong and others all competed to sell, and because the British gold tended to be loose, the price of silver mutually reached 625, and Mitsui bought it for 6875. The market atmosphere was sluggish, and it suddenly broke through the 30 tael mark, reaching 28 taels and 9 cents at 10:20. However, it rose again in a moment, because a certain bank stepped in to chase it. Daxing Yong and others were eager to buy, and Xingye and others even ate 5625 to 625 British gold, so it soared by 5 taels, reaching 33 taels and 7 cents at 10:50. In just ten minutes, it was suppressed by another 2 taels and 0 cents, as the scattered households sold. After 11:15, it rose to the clouds. Daxing Yong, Dingchang, Jinan, Dadetcheng, Yuanheng, and speculators all came to buy, and the British gold was only settled at one and a half, reaching 37 and a half taels after 11:45. Then, Heng Yu and Heng Xing sold. By noon, it closed at 36 and a half taels, and then it rose to 78 taels, as the goods were dragged in. The asking price was changed to 764 taels, a discount of 323 taels to 267 taels.</p>
<h3>Active Buying in the Afternoon Market</h3>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 37 taels and 2 cents, then rose to 8 taels, and then fell back to 6 taels and 5 cents. There were not many buyers and sellers. At 2:15, the Indian exchange rate was reported to have fallen by one or two annas. Dadetcheng, Tianfeng, Yuanyuan Heng, Hongxing, Yongfeng, and others all entered, and Mitsui Huabi and others absorbed the July British gold at 13 and a half. Xingye exited at 4375, so the situation was good. In more than ten minutes, the price rose by 4 taels to 40 taels and 5 cents. However, because Yu Da Yi, Yu Yifeng Yong, and others sold in succession, and Mitsui exited the June-July British gold at 4175 to a halfpenny, and HSBC exited at a halfpenny, people's hearts were frustrated and the price immediately fell by more than 3 taels, reaching 37 taels and 1 cent at 3:30. There were some buyers on the platform, and the price was pulled up by 1 tael and 0 cents to 38 taels and 34 cents. Then, Yu Da and others sold tirelessly, because the recent British gold HSBC and Zhengjin mutually traded at a halfpenny, so the price fell again by more than 2 taels, reaching 35 taels and 8 cents at 4:15. At 4:30, the market closed and the price rose again to 37 taels and 8 cents. However, the goods were sold on a hedge, and the price was suppressed by about 2 taels. Compared to the previous day, it rose by 6 taels. (According to the listing price) According to the daily maximum price of 40 taels and 5 cents, and the minimum price of 28 taels and 9 cents, the difference was 11 taels and 6 cents. The early market for goods was 32 taels and 5 cents, the noon closing was 7 taels and 8 cents, the afternoon was 7 taels and 3 cents, and the closing market was 6 taels and 8 cents.

The gold market turned from weak to strong, and once crossed the 740 tael mark. However, the result was that it re-entered the pass. The daily increase was still strong, so the closing prices of various exchanges were compared with the previous day. The British gold was reduced by 125, the U.S. gold was 25, and the Japanese gold increased by 1 minute and 25 cents, which was a sign of overt looseness and covert tightness.

<p>Interest Rates Weaken</p>
<p>Due to Extensive Trading by Banks...Because Securities Will Be Delivered</p>
<h3>Market Overview</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign exchange banks engaged in quite a bit of trading, but prices instead felt low. The reason for this is that today is the day for securities delivery, so those who have a large quantity of spot goods generally entrust financial institutions to pre-sell and send them to foreign firms. The banks, in order to maintain stable interest rates, have been absorbing them to offset the drop. There are no other special influences.</p>
<h3>Interest Rate Spreads</h3>
<p>(Foreign Interest) The interest rate in both the morning and afternoon markets was 7 mace and 3 fen, which is slightly lower by 3 hao and 7 hu and half a si compared to the previous day. However, people are generally optimistic, so as soon as there is any weakening, people come out to absorb it. (Silver Interest) The morning market was quite advantageous, with rates opening at 4 fen. The afternoon market was slightly weaker, with rates of 3 fen. Adding water to the spread resulted in 2 or 3 fen. The trend of the silver market is slightly better than the past few days.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Subject to High Pressure from US Cotton</h3>
<p>Old Positions Flowing Out...New Short Positions Emerging Vigorously</p>
<p>The yarn market is experiencing a sharp decline, and the situation is quite weak. Since the one-corner mark for US cotton has already been broken, people are terrified. Some long positions are being closed out on a large scale, and new short positions are eagerly coming in. Sellers are taking the opportunity to exert pressure, which makes the market even more unstable. However, a certain major merchant is taking a calm stance and is not taking much action. Sales are slightly weak, and because the decline in yarn futures is too severe, all the guilds are holding back and not taking action.</p>
<h3>Human Biao (Brand) Falls by More Than Two Taels</h3>
<p>In the previous market, the Human Biao (Brand) market opened with US cotton performing poorly, and there were many sellers, causing the downward trend to become more acute. Prices fell by 1 tael, 3, 6, 7, and 8 qian, to 2 taels and 3 qian. In the afternoon, a large number of long positions were closed out, and sellers exerted pressure, causing people to become even more relaxed. Prices for each month fell again by 6, 7, 8, and 9 qian, to 1 tael. The number of transactions totaled 54,250 bales. It was found that Shenxin sold 3,250 bales, Gongtai 1,100 bales, Tianjiang 4,950 bales, Rongxing 1,550 bales, Changji 1,700 bales, and Tongxing 1,800 bales. Tongyu bought 2,850 bales, Yuantai 1,200 bales, Yiyu 1,800 bales, Yongda 1,100 bales, and Shenchang 1,450 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

Fellow merchants entered 700 bales, with prices falling by 5 qian to 1 tael and a half or so. Among the non-local merchants, 205 bales were entered for the interior, 120 bales for Tianjin, 350 bales for Gaoyang, 60 bales for Sichuan, and 150 bales for miscellaneous regions.</p>
<h3>Poor Environmental Conditions Lead to More Decline in Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very weak, and the downward trend is very strong. The breaking of the one-corner line for US cotton has caused people to panic once again. Long positions are being closed out, and sellers are exerting pressure, causing the market to become even weaker. However, Japanese merchants are still pulling hard and are unwilling to let go. The future course depends on the progress of foreign cotton.</p>
<h3>Han Biao (Brand) Falls by 8 or 9 Qian</h3>
<p>In the previous market, the Han Biao (Brand) market opened with poor external cotton conditions, and the market was very weak. Prices for each month fell by 8 qian.

<h3>Food Prices: Japonica Rice Rises Rapidly</h3>
<p>There Is Talk of Implementing Packing for Export</p>
<h3>Zhabei</h3>
<p>Yesterday, over 20 boats arrived at the riverbank. Northern japonica rice buns are easy to move. According to reliable information, this time packing for export involves transporting them to various ports within the country, such as Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yingkou in the north, and Fujian and Guangdong provinces in the south, in order to facilitate circulation. It is also rumored that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has approved this matter, and is currently awaiting the approval of the Municipal Government. As a result, buyers have already begun purchasing for several days, so yesterday the price of japonica rice jumped by as much as 3 jiao, and the situation was very brisk. Thin rice also followed the market and rose by 1 or 2 jiao, but transactions were not strong. There is not much attention being paid to goat-scented indica and Du indica, and the market is only slightly better by 1 jiao. White yuan rice buying interest has turned good, and the overall market continues to improve by 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>South Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of goods from various guilds were not many. This street welcomed white japonica rice buyers very much, and prices uniformly rose by 4 jiao. Transactions were unusually smooth, and the market showed a continuing upward trend. The number of boats arriving with thin early indica rice from the southern guilds was still scarce. Although sales were average, due to the overall trend, prices followed and rose by about 2 jiao. Goat-scented indica and Du indica arrivals and sales were both weak. The situation of firm prices changed. Yuan Yin changed into a customer, choosing higher prices and moving forward. Diao Wei chose skillfully and moved forward, so market transactions were not smooth, but prices rose by about 1 jiao and a half.</p>
<h3>Customer Indica Prices Fall, Sales Are Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the customer indica market suddenly became lively. Because the Guangdong guilds suddenly had a strong interest, and purchases on this street were also robust, the overall market traded more than 4,000 packages, slightly embellishing the market that had been quiet for several months. However, prices were weaker than the previous week. This is because customers have not had smooth sales for a long time, and the weather is gradually getting hot, making it easy for stored rice to become moldy. Stocking merchants and cargo customers had to reduce prices to seek to get rid of it. After the price reduction, the customers thought it was worthwhile to buy, so the market was able to become active. Throughout the day, 2,500 packages of late Jiangxi machine rice were opened, priced at 11 yuan and 4 jiao and a half to 10 yuan and 9 jiao. Also, 1,500 packages of early machine rice were opened, priced at 10 yuan and 2 jiao to 9 yuan and 9 jiao, which were taken by the Guangdong guilds and this street. This street also purchased 200 packages of Chuzhou machine rice, priced at 9 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, and 150 packages of Liuhe brown rice, priced at 8 yuan, 1 jiao, and 9 fen.</p>
<h3>Powder Market Has Little Hope of Exceeding High Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the powder market opened in the morning, the price of foreign wheat was slightly better in the markets for all months. The Tianjin guilds are also moving to handle business in the spot market for this month, so when opening prices, the near-term was about 1 fen better compared to the previous day's close, while the distant months presented a stalemate with little fluctuation. When it came to the afternoon opening, the atmosphere shifted to average, as northern guilds gradually settled out in this current month. Distant months, due to rumors of foreign flour calling out for prices of 2 yuan and 6 jiao (2 yuan and 6 jiao and a half the week before), and customer guilds countering with prices of 2 yuan and 5 jiao, although it has yet to be confirmed, people were inevitably concerned. At a price of 2 yuan and 5 jiao, the Shanghai yuan equivalents to 2 taels and 7 hao and 8 si. The future situation has no hope of exceeding high prices. As a result, this month was slightly better by 2 li and a half compared to the previous day, May was better by 2 li and a half, and the rest showed no fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of wheat futures, the markets for each month generally presented a stable appearance. With the price of foreign wheat improving by about 2 or 3 jiao, people felt slightly more stable. However, due to the fact that it was sometimes sunny and sometimes rainy, the intentions of the domestic guilds were relatively firm. But based on the facts, the manufacturers' foreign wheat reserves are extremely abundant, so there is no reason for it to be too brisk. As a result, May was unchanged, June was better by 1 fen, July was unchanged, and August and September were each better by 1 fen.</p>
<p>Standard Cake and Bean Market Both Stable</p>
<h3>Bean Futures</h3>
<p>The market was extremely flat yesterday. There was only a fluctuation of 1 fen in each of the morning and afternoon markets. Although domestic guilds had purchases, the numbers were extremely small. Although even the telegrams in the afternoon reported an increase, the numbered guilds had a lot of sales due to recent sluggish spot sales. As a result, the closing price presented a stable appearance. April futures were 4 taels and 6 mace and a half, May futures were 4 taels and 6 mace and 6 fen, both flat. June futures were 4 taels and 6 mace and 7, estimated to be better by 1 fen.</p>
<h3>Cake Futures</h3>
<p>Transactions have been very active in recent days, and all parties have been buying and selling smoothly, but prices have been unusually stable, with only a few li of fluctuations. Although even the market also reported good news in the afternoon, customer guilds had a very strong desire to sell, and the inside guilds were lukewarm and watched. It was only when the green needed to arrive that they advanced. As a result, the July lower period for April, May, June, and July showed no fluctuations, and the July upper period was slightly better by 2 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea European and American Silk Sales Become More Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market for foreign firms in this port became even more sluggish. It was found that Hua silk factories in the European and American markets were not moving, and silk prices continued to be weak. Telegrams from Shanghai all reported no change, and the market atmosphere was depressed. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others entered 15 packages of Shanghai white factory warp, Qianli entered 10 packages of white dry warp, and Samsung entered 6 packages of coarse white silk. Prices are all trending downward.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Factory Warp Shipments to Shanghai Surge</h3>
<p>As the end of April approaches in an instant, Wuxi silk manufacturers are rushing to sell off this month's silk futures. As the settlement period is approaching, they are actively transporting goods to Shanghai. On previous days, factories such as Minfeng transported a total of 175 pieces of white factory warp to Shanghai to prepare for settlement with foreign firms.</p>
<h3>Suian New Green Tea Has Already Been Weighed</h3>
<p>Suian is an important area in Zhejiang Province for tea production. Its production is also uniquely early compared to other places. The number of tea factories and firms in that route has not increased or decreased in the county, and has decreased by 4 or 5 in the townships. Since the 23rd, all mountain households have started picking, and the tea leaves produced are much finer and tenderer than last year. This is because all were warned in advance by the firms that they would be rejected if they did not pick early. On the 26th, various townships had already started weighing, and the agreed-upon new market price ranged from 38 or 39 yuan to 45 yuan, which is 70% lower than last year. However, because the tea firms had significant losses last year, their silver funds are not loose and their intention to buy is not strong.</p>
<h3>Broadcloth and Dark Green Biji Sales Rise Again</h3>
<p>Dark green plain biji, which was once popular in Shanghai, has declined for several years. The stock is very plentiful, and sellers are willing to cut prices to sell it, mostly trying to over-dye it in other colors. Recently, sales have risen again. This is because buyers are working hard to promote it, and Sichuan guilds and local new clothing guilds continue to inquire. Transactions for three or five pi or ten or twenty pi are happening one after another. However, the stopping price must be particularly cheap, averaging five or six qian cheaper than the usual blue-gray colors. Yesterday, brands such as Taihe Longfengyuan were selling for 2 taels and 8 or 9 qian, while bald dark green was only 2 taels and 1 qian. Ningfeng's Jiang crossing banquet multi-colored biji was selling for 2 taels and 6 or 7 qian, while dark green was 2 taels and 5 fen.</p>
<p>Hardware: New Lead Wire Deteriorates</p>
<p>Arrival of British Tinplate Awaited</p>
<h3>New Lead Wire</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the glut of stock, people have become depressed, and the standard trend has been deteriorating. Currently, the market price for Nos. 16 to 20 is only 13 taels and a half per dan, and the price for Nos. 21 to 25 is also only 18 taels and 7 qian and a half, which is 3 or 4 qian less than the previous market. Transactions are slightly active in areas such as the Yangtze River, and only assortments of colors are being distributed by guilds in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Ningbo.</p>
<h3>British Tinplate</h3>
<p>Recently, the existing goods have been bought up by Tianjin guilds, causing a shortage of existing goods in the market. As a result, standard prices have been rising step by step. The current price can be sold for 16 taels and a half per box, which is 2 qian and a half better than before. It is heard that the next batch of new goods will be imported on the 4th of next month, so the number of customers ordering futures is quite strong. It is found that the cargo that has been authorized also reaches 600 to 700 boxes, priced at 16 taels and 25.</p>

<h3>Mr. Song, Minister, and the Secretary-General of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Employing Specialist Groups as Advisors</p>
<p>The Journey of the Three Representatives to China</p>
<p>A letter from Minister of Finance Song Ziwen to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations: Respected Secretary-General of the League of Nations, I have received instructions from Chairman Chiang, that the National Government has resolved to establish a National Economic Council to plan all economic construction matters. After several consultations with the three representatives sent by your organization to China, we deeply admire the potential for cooperation between your organization and our country within this scope. Therefore, the National Government intends to invite various specialist groups from your organization to serve as advisors on the construction of the National Economic Council, and the methods are listed as follows: (1) When the National Economic Council begins its work, at the request of the National Government, your organization may send capable personnel to China for a short period to provide advice on the council's direction and to maintain liaison with your organization in the future. They will also collaborate on planning important working methods suitable for the economic situation to help create a favorable national livelihood for modern times. (2) Regarding the implementation of designated projects, upon the National Government's request, your organization may recommend experts from within or outside the organization to come to China for assistance and to liaise with your organization's specialist groups on technical matters. (3) Under appropriate circumstances, for the convenience of consultation, the National Government intends to request that your organization form a specialist committee in Europe, composed of experienced personnel, to study issues designated by the National Government. (4) The National Government intends to train various specialized personnel needed for future projects abroad, and your organization will be able to provide assistance, such as the de facto cooperation your organization already has with our country on health-related matters, such as introducing domestic personnel to Europe and the United States for training in health matters. Regarding education matters, your organization can also select advisory experts to come to China to assist in developing educational system plans, and to enable our country to have closer ties with various world cultural centers. (5) During our country's progress, if problems arise or it is necessary to adopt common policies or methods of cooperation with various related countries, our country will propose that your organization initiate and plan together in accordance with the aforementioned scope. The National Government and the National Economic Council will receive technical guidance and support from your organization's specialist groups at any time for various construction projects, so that the spirit of cooperation between our country and your organization can be fully expressed in the construction of a new China, and the people's livelihood will see daily progress, which is especially what we rely on. I respectfully send this telegram for your consideration, Song Ziwen.</p>
<p>The League of Nations, invited by the National Government, dispatched representatives to China successively from December of the 19th year of the Republic (1930) to April of the 20th year (1931). Those who arrived during these months included Dr. Rajchman, Director of the Health Section; Mr. Haas, Director of the Communications Section; and Mr. Stoppani, Director of the Economic Section, as well as their secretaries and staff. Now all the representatives have returned to their countries one after another. The last to depart were Mr. Stoppani and his staff, who left Beijing on April 16. Thus, the mission of the League of Nations representatives to China has come to an end. The National Government has now made a solemn decision that all domestic construction matters will be planned comprehensively by the established National Economic Council, and after several consultations with the League of Nations representatives, it has been agreed that the League of Nations and our country will engage in thorough cooperation in spirit, and that its various technical groups can provide advice to our government and the National Economic Council at any time to assist in all important construction facilities. Dr. Rajchman first came to China in the winter of the 18th year of the Republic (1929). When he left Beijing, he carried a proposal from our Ministry of Health for cooperation with the League of Nations, with League of Nations experts assisting our country in various health-related constructions, such as epidemic prevention, the establishment of a national health design and implementation office in the capital, the expansion of medical education, the prevention of cholera in Shanghai, and the introduction of our personnel to Europe and the United States for training in health matters. The above plan was implemented in May of the 19th year of the Republic, so when Dr. Rajchman arrived in China again, the cooperation between our country and the League of Nations on health matters had already been successfully concluded. As a result of repeated consultations between Dr. Rajchman and the Ministry of Health this time, it was decided to increase and expand the original health plan. Mr. Haas stayed in China for more than a month, and the relevant departments of the National Government frequently met with him to discuss various issues related to the development of domestic transportation. It is now planned to seek assistance from the International Communications Section in our country's planning of the Huai River guiding project, to discuss various important cases under study by the North China Water Conservancy Commission, and to discuss the planned development project of the Greater Shanghai Port. It has also been decided to establish a National Civil Engineering Design and Implementation Office in Nanjing to cultivate civil engineering experts for surveying and planning on various projects during future road construction and Huai River guiding, and to use this office as a gathering place for civil engineering experts from all over the country. The National Government also intends to invite League of Nations experts to assist in the above plan. Mr. Stoppani came to China to study the various measures that our country should take in the face of the global economic recession. The relevant departments and authorities also had several detailed discussions with Mr. Stoppani on various important issues related to fiscal and economic policies. It is also planned to have cooperative methods and, when needed, to selectively employ experts from the League of Nations Economic Section to come to China to serve as consultants to the relevant departments in planning important economic and financial issues. When the National Economic Council begins its work, the National Government also plans to ask the League of Nations to send an experienced consultant to China to assist in planning and to solicit what strategies to use to achieve the cooperation of various technical groups of the League of Nations. Furthermore, for the sake of convenience, the National Government has designated personnel as liaison officers between our country and the League of Nations Economic Section. The National Government further hopes that the above-mentioned methods and proposals can enable the government and the National Economic Council to cooperate closely with the international community, so that the national economy and the people's livelihood can receive this spiritual support and make daily progress, which is especially fortunate.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance is Implementing the Gold Standard</h3>
<p>The Central Bank Acts as an Agent for Collecting Gold Bars to Prepare for Minting Gold Coins</p>
<p>The Currency Department Dispatches Personnel to Investigate Foreign Banknotes in China</p>
<p>Customs Gold Exchange Certificates Will Have a Tendency to Circulate in the Market</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's plan to change the national currency system to the gold standard has begun to be implemented after the Kemmerer Economic Mission formulated a transformation plan. According to a survey by the New Sound News Agency, recently the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance has specially dispatched personnel to Shanghai and important commercial ports in the north and south to investigate the number of banknotes issued by foreign banks in our country and their circulation in the market in order to find ways to gradually eliminate them so as not to cause obstacles when the gold standard plan is realized in the future. On the one hand, Central Bank and other banks in this city are acting as agents to purchase gold bars in order to prepare for the minting of gold coins. Recently, the Central Bank has collected more than 45,000 gold bars from gold merchants such as Yuan Xingyong, Da Xingyong, Qian Changxiang, and the Exchange. There was one shipment to the United States for minting last time. Regarding the issuance of Customs Gold Exchange Certificates by the Central Bank, it is said that they are sold to merchants by the bank's business bureau. When merchants pay customs duties, they must pay taxes with exchange certificates. At the same time, this type of exchange certificate has become a test for changing the gold standard system. Originally, after the exchange certificates were issued, merchants felt it was convenient to use. When purchasing goods with gold prices, they inevitably used exchange certificates to pay in cash. Therefore, this type of exchange certificate has a gradual tendency to circulate in the market, and the test of changing to the gold coin system began as a result.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Railways Plans to Reduce Freight Rates</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways, in order to seek revitalization of domestic products and industrial plans, has heard that it plans to reduce the freight rates for goods needed for people's livelihood and goods that compete with foreign countries when transported by railways throughout the country. It is currently in the planning stage.</p>
<h3>The Sanbei Minghe Steamer Suffers an Accident</h3>
<p>Ran Aground in Peacock Harbor</p>
<p>All Crew Members Rescued</p>
<p>Fengpu Going to Tow Today</p>
<p>Recently, merchant ship accidents have occurred frequently, and most of them are Chinese merchant ships. The Huayang Steamer of the Hang'an Company just ran aground on Yushan Island in Wenzhou Ocean, and the Minghe Steamer of the Sanbei Company ran aground on the Taktka Sea surface north of Vladivostok. It is heard that the crew members have been rescued and there are no casualties, but the cargo and crew members have been damaged. Ships have now been dispatched for rescue. The information obtained is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Soviet Lease</h3>
<p>The Sanbei Minghe Steamer was once handled by Lai Ci Foreign Firm for lease and operated in the Vladivostok area. This year, the Soviet Commercial Fleet, in order to transport goods from the coastal states of northern Russia, specially entrusted the Commercial Office of the Chinese Eastern Railway in this city to rent ten Chinese merchant ships in Shanghai to go to Vladivostok and send them to northern Russia to load seafood, wood, etc. to be transported to various places. The Sanbei Minghe Steamer continues to be leased by the Soviet Fleet. It just left Shanghai for Vladivostok when the port opened last month.</p>
<h3>Ran Aground Due to Fog</h3>
<p>After arriving in Vladivostok, the Minghe was dispatched by the Soviet Merchant Fleet to operate in the coastal states of northern Russia. Due to weather conditions, there is often fog in that area, and the voyage is dangerous. Last winter, the Nanshan Muller Steamer of the Lai Ci Foreign Firm also ran aground in the fog north of Vladivostok. Although all the crew members were rescued, the hull has not been dragged away from the rocks. This time, the Minghe Steamer, while traveling to Peacock Harbor, near the Nanshan Muller Steamer, also encountered fog. At that time, because the route was obscured, it mistakenly sailed onto the rocks, and the hull was stranded. The bottom of the ship has been broken by the rocks, and seawater rushed into the ship. After the accident, the shipowner urgently sent a telegram for help. Fortunately, it was not far from Vladivostok, and the crew members were all rescued.</p>
<h3>Crew Members Rescued</h3>
<p>After the Minghe accident, the radio received it from the Soviet Merchant Fleet and urgently dispatched a ship from Vladivostok to the Taktka (ie, Peacock Harbor) sea surface nearby, put down the sampan boat, and rescued all the crew members and sailors in the Minghe Steamer, and carried them back to Vladivostok. Most of the cargo in the ship has been immersed in seawater, and will be transshipped separately. After the crew members arrived in Vladivostok, they sent a telegram to Shanghai to report to the Shanghai Bureau.</p>
<h3>Dispatching Ships for Rescue</h3>
<p>After this incident occurred, on the Sanbei Company's side, because the ship's staff were all safely evacuated, there were actually no losses. The hull is covered by marine insurance. Yesterday, it was heard that the company had decided to specially dispatch the Fengpu Steamer of the Shanghai-Yangtze River route to Peacock Harbor to tow and rescue the ship. The Fengpu Steamer was preparing everything yesterday and will depart for that place today. It is learned that the Minghe Steamer has more than 2,000 tons and can travel along the Yangtze River. The value of the hull is about 200,000 taels, and it is an excellent ship of the Sanbei Company.</p>
<h3>Various Groups Held a Meeting Yesterday to Strive for the Xin Haishan Case</h3>
<p>Telegraphing the Central Government to Abolish the Treaty and Abolish Consular Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Demanding Punishment of the Murderer, Apology, Compensation, etc.</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency said that the case of the French Concession Western Police shooting Xin Haishan has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Although the Municipal Government has filed a protest, there has been no result. All circles in this city are extremely indignant and specially convened a conference of all circles in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday to discuss everything. The various situations are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3>Participating Groups</h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Cigarette Industry Workers' Union, Sanyou Workers' Union, Public Bus Workers' Union, Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union, New Medicine Industry, Sausage Industry, Seafood and Grocery Industry, Foil Industry, Sugar Industry, Color Printing Industry, Silk and Satin Industry, Bean and Rice Industry, Miscellaneous Grain Industry, Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry, Pawnshop Industry, Fresh Fish Industry, and other trade associations, Ningbo Fellow Association, Sanshan Guild Hall, Party Headquarters of various districts, and other representatives of more than 190 groups, including Ye Huijun, Zheng Chengqing, Fang Jiaobo, Zhu Wenqi, Cheng Xiechun, Luo Qinghua, Zhu Shujian, Mao Chuntuan, Huang Ruixiang, Fan Yifeng, and others, totaling more than 580 people, elected Fang Jiaobo as the chairman.</p>
<h3>Representative Speeches</h3>
<p>The chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by Shao Baoxing reporting the facts of the case, followed by Zheng Chengqing's speech: Everyone, today we are convening all circles to discuss helping our compatriot Xin Haishan, who was shot and wounded by a French policeman for no reason. As a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce attending the conference, I feel very heartbroken. Think about it, everyone, we Chinese are in our own territory, and we are shot and injured by a blue-eyed, yellow-haired person for no reason. How shameful and humiliating is this? As for the facts of the case, I believe everyone has already understood them, so I won't repeat them. Observing from this incident, we can get two impressions. First, Xin's injury is enough to show that Westerners are inherently cruel and inhuman. Second, imperialism is using unequal treaties as a talisman to demonstrate. Think about it, everyone, if we Chinese accidentally injure and kill a foreign dog, it is like committing a major crime and we have to pay countless compensations. Now a French policeman has shot and injured our compatriot, but the authorities turn a blind eye and let the murderer roam free. Such disregard for human life, where do they put our compatriots? It's not even as good as a foreign dog. A French policeman can arbitrarily shoot Xin, and can also trample on any compatriot at any time. Therefore, this matter is superficially just a French policeman shooting a Chinese person. If we observe it in detail, it is indeed a mobilization order for imperialists to demonstrate to small and weak nations. If we are not willing to be slaughtered by them, if we do not want to be slaves of a conquered country, we should unite to avenge our compatriot Xin, and seriously negotiate with the French Concession authorities, demanding punishment of the murderer, apology, compensation, and guarantees that such incidents will not happen again in the future. Further, we must also request the government to take back the concessions and abolish all unequal treaties. We hope that people from all walks of life will unite and become the government's backing to achieve the final victory, then our compatriot Xin's injury will not be a sacrifice in vain. That's all. Next, Zhu Shujian and Mao Chunpu expressed their opinions.</p>
<h3>Meeting Situation</h3>
<p>The discussion was then held: (A) The proposal to issue a declaration was passed. (B) The proposal to telegraph the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government to automatically announce the cancellation of unequal treaties and the abolition of consular jurisdiction was passed. (C) The proposal to telegraph the National Government to immediately take back all concessions in the country was passed. (D) The proposal to telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to actively negotiate to achieve punishment of the murderer, apology, compensation, and guarantees that the same incident will not happen again in the future, and to telegraph the national consensus, was passed. (E) The proposal to organize the Shanghai All Circles Aid Xin Haishan Committee was discussed and passed. Zheng Chengqing, Shao Baoxing, Ye Jiaxing, Yuan Hongjun, Mao Chunpu, Sun Choucheng, Sun Mingqi, Tong Xinqin, Zhang Yihai, Huang Ruixiang, and Fan Yifeng were elected as committee members, and the United Association of Shanghai Citizens was used as a liaison office for representative contact. Next, a temporary motion was proposed by the Sanshan Guild Hall that foreign merchant insurance companies rely on the power of imperialism to try to damage new economic compensation. Please notify chambers of commerce across the country and trade associations in this city to refuse foreign merchant insurance companies in the future and change to Chinese insurance companies. The proposal was passed. Finally, other important cases were discussed and the meeting adjourned. The telegram draft is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Issuing a Declaration</h3>
<p>Compatriots, the case of the French policeman shooting our compatriot Xin Haishan for no reason, I believe all circles have been shocked. The facts of the case are as follows: "Xin Haishan, an employee of the Changhe Seafood Shop, was shot without cause by a Western policeman from the French Concession Police Station at the intersection of Yong'an Street and Pu'an Lane in the French Concession at about 9:00 pm on April 7. The bullet pierced his neck and he immediately fell to the ground, unconscious. The policeman, knowing that he had caused the disaster, hurriedly moved Xin to a side alley in Pu'an Lane with a fellow policeman in an attempt to escape. For a time, there was a lot of noise, and those who watched were very upset. At that time, Li Dexuan, a Tianjin native, witnessed the situation and was filled with righteous indignation. He immediately recorded the Western policeman's badge number, 158. The Chinese policeman in charge of the alley then telephoned the French Concession Police Station to be able to jointly send Xin to Renji Hospital for treatment in a car with Chinese and Western policemen. At present, his breath is only lingering and his life is in danger." It is found that the Western policeman's unprovoked trampling on the good and the kind is really disregarding the law. However, the reason why he has nothing to fear is that he is protected by the concession. After the incident, the reason why the person who caused the disaster can roam free is that he is guaranteed by consular jurisdiction. The reason why the concession authorities turn a blind eye and disregard human life is the unequal treaties. Therefore, Xin's injury is due to the Western policeman's tragic and violent behavior, and it is also a demonstration by imperialists using unequal treaties as a weapon. Xin's grievance is not redressed. How can our 40,000 compatriots have life guarantees? If the unequal treaties are not abolished, the Chinese nation will never be freed from shackles. In addition to serious negotiations, punishment of the murderer, apology, compensation, and guarantees, etc., we will not give up until the goal is achieved. We also hope that compatriots across the country will work hard to rise up and take it as our responsibility to take back the concessions, abolish consular jurisdiction, and cancel unequal treaties. Unite as one and become the government's backing for the project. We would rather be shattered jade than complete tiles. This is the declaration.</p>
<h3>Telegraphed Across the Country</h3>
<p>(1) The Central Party Headquarters and the National Government are respectfully informed that unequal treaties are like invading wild boars and long snakes that are meant to aggress against us.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Consular jurisdiction is like shackles and traps that are meant to bind us. Imperialists have used this to infringe upon our sovereignty, massacre our compatriots, and oppress us wantonly. For eighty years, the wounds have been great and the pain has been deep, and it is impossible to endure it any longer. The traces of blood from the brutal killing of Xin Dingxiang by French sailors have not yet dried, and the tragedy of the Western policeman shooting Xin Haishan has occurred again. If unequal treaties are not abolished, how can there be an end to tragic and violent acts? If consular jurisdiction is not revoked, how can public justice be extended? However, unequal treaties are the imperialists' weapons to aggress against small and weak nations, and consular jurisdiction is their talisman to oppress our compatriots. In this era when the idea of power is prevalent, it is no different from seeking skin from a tiger to ask them to abolish it in good faith with an attitude of friendship and consultation. However, at this time when national unification is beginning construction, in order to respect national public opinion and to seek the freedom of the nation, we should resolutely take revolutionary measures to automatically announce the cancellation of unequal treaties and the abolition of consular jurisdiction. The precedents of Japan and Siam are already there, and the model of Turkey is not far away. We hope that we will proceed quickly and thoroughly. Respectfully stated, we hope that you will consider and adopt it. (2) The National Government is respectfully informed that since the Opium War, concessions have arisen as a result. Imperialists have been able to occupy municipal administration and control police power. The people of the whole country, under the oppression of this power, feel pain as deep as water and as hot as fire. The French Concession in Shanghai is especially the source of all evil. Shanghai is like this, and other French Concessions in various places cannot be exceptions. The Chinese nation is neither drunk and dreaming nor willing to bow its head and endure. I dare to telegraph the President to take back all the concessions in the country, starting with taking back the French Concession, in order to save our compatriots and restore national rights. We earnestly express our words and hope that you will consider them. Shanghai All Circles Aid Xin Haishan Case Committee kowtows. (3) National Government Ministry of Foreign Affairs and national elders, the case of French Police Station No. 158 Western Police shooting our compatriot Xin Haishan without cause on April 7 has, it is assumed, reached your awareness. After the incident, various agencies were asked to seriously negotiate with the French Police Station and the French Consul, but there has been no result. Since the French police can arbitrarily shoot Xin, they can also trample on our compatriots at any time. Such wanton violence is intolerable in the world. Even if the Western police rely on the protection of the concession, before our national sovereignty can be exercised without reduction, it seems that there is no need to endure humiliation and should actively negotiate to achieve the punishment of the murderer, apology, compensation, and guarantees that the same incident will not happen again in the future. Otherwise, the sacrifice of Xin alone is limited, and the people of the whole country will be prisoners on death row, and our country will be in danger for a long time. In addition to sending telegrams across the country to call for unified assistance, we send telegrams to you, asking you to seriously negotiate and pray to achieve the goal. We cannot but urgently await your orders.</p>
<h3>After the Customs Declaration Workers Resumed Work, the Cotton Cloth from This Factory Stopped Transportation</h3>
<p>Because the Cotton Cloth Industry Refused to Collect Docking Fees</p>
<p>The Social Bureau is Scheduled to Convene Again Today for Mediation</p>
<p>After the customs declaration workers in this city resumed work, cargo transportation resumed. Starting yesterday, due to the docking fee issue, cotton cloth from this factory was invisibly stopped from transportation again. The Social Bureau is scheduled to convene again today for mediation. The various situations are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Transportation Stopped</h3>
<p>More than 80 companies among the cotton cloth industry that distribute white cotton cloth from this factory, such as Baotai, unanimously united yesterday and refused to collect docking fees. Because the distributors refused and the buyers did not recognize it, the customs declaration industry had no choice but to temporarily stop customs declaration. Therefore, starting yesterday, cotton cloth from this factory was invisibly stopped from transportation again. Yesterday, the Cotton Cloth Industry Association sent personnel to various companies to solicit opinions on this case in order to submit them to the authorities for review.</p>
<h3>Authorities Mediation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau notified the Customs Declaration Industry Association, the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, and the Customs Declaration Industry Workers' Union yesterday that: For the matter of notification, according to the association's presentation, please convene to sign formal conditions in order to end the matter. This bureau is scheduled to convene a mediation at 1:00 pm on April 29. It is hereby notified that two responsible representatives are scheduled to attend the bureau to await mediation.</p>
<h3>Association Congress</h3>
<p>The Customs Declaration Industry Association held a members' congress at 3:00 pm yesterday. Yuan Fengkun Ji Shi Zhiben, Zhaoshang Yu Yousen Ting, and other 41 companies attended. Chairman Shi Zhiben discussed the following cases: (1) Wu Yaoting proposed that after collecting docking fees from the distributors, customs declaration should be carried out, otherwise customs declaration and loading should be refused. The whole body agreed. (2) The majority advocated that if any companies privately declared out of greed for business after refusing to declare, it was decided that the Customs Declaration Industry Association would handle it. (3) The representatives of the Northern Gang proposed that for all cotton yarn and cotton cloth transported to Dongbei, Niuzhuang, Andong, Dalian, Longkou, Chongqing, Wanxian, and other ports, if there is a unified tax form and customs duties are paid later, the tax paid can be recovered from the tax bureau after the unified tax form arrives at the destination and is stamped by the customs or tax bureau and sent back according to the regulations of the unified tax bureau. However, our companies cannot prepay customs duties, and it was decided that buyers should collect customs duties from distributors before customs declaration, otherwise customs declaration should be refused. For the tax on various colors of cloth, the same method should be followed.</p>
<h3>The Opening Prelude to the Shanghai Mint</h3>
<p>Investigators Going to the United States Will Return to China</p>
<p>A National News Agency report from Philadelphia on the 27th stated that the Shanghai Mint had previously sent two Chinese officials and American Xu Weite to the United States to visit various departments of the government mint in Philadelphia and investigate coin minting in detail. They will return to China in May or early June. It is heard that the Shanghai Mint will start work after the three officials return. According to Xu, he was lent to China by the US government to supervise the construction of the mint. He has been in China for ten years. The completion of the Shanghai Mint is mostly due to his planning. The equipment of the factory is entirely modeled after the American style, and its machines are also shipped from the United States. It can be called the most modern mint in the world.</p>
<h3>A Large Quantity of American Silver Bars to Arrive</h3>
<p>Estimated Value: 1.5 Million Taels</p>
<p>Since the Jianghai Customs House prohibited the import of foreign silver, the amount of large silver bars being shipped to Shanghai by various countries has gradually decreased. However, reliable sources in this city received information yesterday that a large batch of American silver bars, estimated to be over a thousand bars, totaling 1.5 million taels, has been purchased by major banks in Shanghai and a telegram has been sent to Shanghai. The silver is expected to pass Yokohama, Japan today, and will be shipped to Shanghai for unloading within about ten days.</p>
<h3>The Sixth District Party Headquarters Telegraphs Request for Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>The Sixth District Party Headquarters of this city issued a circular telegram, stating: (Official titles omitted) We believe that a nation's right to survival is not built on the smoke screen of gunboats but is founded on the freedom of the nation. The people's right to independence is not chained to the machinery of politics but is based on international equality. Today, although our country possesses a beautiful culture of thousands of years, the result of the insidious erosion of "white peril" has led to the loss of sovereignty and foreign insults, and we are all bound to the cross of slavery. Therefore, the sweat and blood of our four hundred million descendants are only used for the free sucking of the great powers, and the fat and oil of our four million square miles of land are only used to fill the remnants of the gluttonous neighbor's saliva. They are the cleaver and chopping board, and we are the fish and meat. After the pain subsides, we feel indignant. However, if we try to find the root of the disaster, it is definitely not the seizure by forests of guns and rain of bullets, but rather the only loophole by which imperialists use debt and judicial privileges to carry out the annihilation of weak nations. Therefore, our country's poverty is not due to internal strife but to economic aggression under consular jurisdiction. Our country's weakness is also not due to famine but to political trampling under consular jurisdiction. Now that our people no longer want to use their free lives as decorations for foreign enjoyment, nor do they want to permanently retain this semi-colonial appellation for our solemn and splendid rivers and mountains. Therefore, we dare to carry out revolutionary diplomacy under the form of nine deaths and one life, in an unbearable situation, to recover our inherent legal rights. This is not only for the survival of the nation but also for world peace, and it should be so. Even for the sake of the commercial interests of the great powers and for the sake of coexistence and co-prosperity, this last resort must be taken. However, according to actual conditions, the consular negotiations that have come to fruition only belong to the Netherlands and Norway, showing a faint glimmer of a low-level shadow of free fruit-bearing equality. Other friendly countries are either waiting and watching, or making excuses to shirk, or even making outrageous counter-proposals to fight against us. Therefore, the slogan of complete legal rights is either shattered by the European and American winds and rains, or clamped down by wooden clogs and purple skirts. The country is in imminent danger, and the people are suffering. Ten thousand catastrophes are upon us, how can we stand by with our hands folded? It is hoped that all our people will stand under the light waves of the blue and white banner and use the true force of national self-determination to destroy this unequal war treaty that is destroying the country. At the same time, it is also hoped that our diplomatic authorities will inherit the fearless spirit of our Prime Minister and resolutely and decisively abolish consular jurisdiction automatically in the bloody honor of the birth of the National Assembly, based on the Turkish precedent, so that the remnants of the powerful nations' saliva will not stain the progress of our revolution. This is not only a strange star of altar, but also the highest honor of the party and the nation. The survival of the Republic of China depends on this one action. We shout out a call for action, hoping for resonance. Respectfully, the Shanghai Special Municipal Sixth District Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China, sincerely.</p>

<h3>Record of the Silk Factory Relief Committee</h3>
<p>The Silk Factory Industry Relief Special Committee of the three districts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai held a plenary committee discussion meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 28th). Shen Huachen, Zhu Jing'an, Wang Xiaolai, (Zhu Jing'an representing), Chu Huiseng, Huang Jin, (Huang Aibo representing), Zhu Mouxian, Wu Shenbo, Yang Yuchu, Cheng Bingruo, Qian Fenghao, (Zhang Zizhen representing), Zhang Zizhen, Xue Shou Xuan, (Chen Pinshan representing), Zhang Yunsheng, Huang Jinfan, etc., all 15 members of the committee, attended. Chairman Shen Huachen presided over the meeting and performed the rituals. First, Chairman Shen reported on the purpose of the meeting and read the articles of the regulations as amended by the Legislative Yuan one by one. The original text of the regulations was read as before. Only four articles were amended: (1) The amount of debt was changed from 6 million yuan to 8 million yuan. (2) The interest rate of 6% was changed to 8%. (3) The implementation date of February 15th was changed to April 15th. (4) The repayment of the principal and interest of the public bonds, which was previously set at 22.50 yuan per picul of silk exported from factories, has now been changed to 30 yuan per picul. After reading, a vote was held to elect the controlling committee. As a result of the ballot counting, Shen Huachen, Chu Huiseng, and Qian Fenghao received the most votes and were elected as members of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bond Controlling Committee together with two members appointed by the Ministry of Industry and one member appointed by the Ministry of Finance to form the Public Bond Controlling Committee to control the public bonds impartially. Next, two members of the Public Bond Fund Custody Committee were elected. As a result, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Jin, and Wu Shenbo each received seven votes, so a lottery method was used. Wang Xiaolai and Huang Jin were drawn and elected. Then Huang's representative, Huang Aibo, immediately declared that Huang himself was unable to take office due to illness and strongly declined. After public deliberation, Wu Shenbo was appointed as a substitute. Then, two important cases were discussed: (1) Although the Xiaoshan Qingyun Silk Weaving Factory has 340 silk reeling machines and a capital of 300,000 yuan, the silk weaving department was shut down at the end of 1927 after opening in 1927, and the silk reeling department was also shut down in the winter of 1929, declaring bankruptcy. Now, because the Zhejiang Construction Department sent a letter requesting relief on behalf of the factory, the question arose as to which district the factory should be under the control of. It was decided that it should be under the control of the Zhejiang Province district. (2) The Shanghai Qianjing Factory sent a letter requesting to enjoy the rights of public bonds. It was decided that the Qianjing Factory's nature of using dried cocoons to reel silk was different, and it was inconvenient to do so, so a letter was sent to reject the request. It was also discussed that the silkworm season in Zhejiang Province this year was not good, and the cocoon production would inevitably be poor, and the tax burden on silk factories would be heavier in the future, and how to handle this. It was decided to request the Zhejiang Provincial Government to be considerate and reduce the burden. The meeting adjourned after the discussion, at 7:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Mr. Li Jingcong's Interview</h3>
<p>Wang Boqun will Return to Beijing After Slight Recovery</p>
<p>Eurasian Test Flight Confirms Intermodal Transportation Time</p>
<p>Printing Stamps in the United States is a Last Resort</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited Li Jingcong, the director of the Aviation Division of the Ministry of Communications, at the Eurasian Aviation Company yesterday. Mr. Li explained the purpose of the company's unofficial opening and the details of the Beijing Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance's dispute over stamp printing as much as possible. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Purpose of the Test Flight</h3>
<p>(Reporter asks) What is the purpose of the company's unofficial opening? (Li answers) Because China and Russia have not restored diplomatic relations, all airplanes of the company cannot pass through Siberia and directly reach Europe. The airmail that is carried can only be transported by airplane to Manzhouli, the border between China and Russia. The section from Manzhouli to Irkutsk cannot but be transported by train, so that the section from Irkutsk to Moscow can be delivered to Russian airplanes for intermodal transportation, and the section from Moscow to Europe can be transported by the German-Russian Aviation Company. The company, in view of the fact that the section from Manzhouli to Irkutsk must be connected with train transportation, and the Siberian trains are often delayed, the company needs to consider how to make the time table universal. Also, the company's wireless equipment along the way is not yet complete, and whether it will affect the flight must be taken into account. Therefore, it is necessary to make a non-official opening of the celebration to test the actual conditions, so as to formulate the time table, and to avoid the situation that the company cannot fly according to the time table after the official opening, which will affect the company's reputation. There have been two unofficial openings, and the departure and arrival are in line with the scheduled time. After about two more flights, the company can officially open and carry mail and passengers. (Question) Recently, various newspapers have revealed news about the dispute between your ministry's post office and the Beijing Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance over stamp printing. What is the truth? (Answer) The post office of the Ministry of Communications, in view of the fact that (1) the Ping Printing Bureau does not have good technicians to supervise, so the image of President Chiang on the United Commemorative Stamps printed last time was rough and distorted, and the sample of the President's posthumous portrait engraved later was also very poorly made; (2) the machinery is old, and there are only 300 people who can print stamps, and the printed stamps are also very poorly made, so for the new stamps, the company has to seek a better way out and find a company with more sophisticated technology to engrave and print the stamps, so as to avoid being criticized by the world after the stamps are issued. However, some types of stamps are still left to the bureau to print, so as to maintain the state-owned enterprise and allow the authorities to reorganize it. As for the rumors that the price of the new stamps is very high and the quantity has increased sharply, they are also untrue. It was found that when the contract was signed with the British company, each US dollar was worth less than 3 yuan in national currency. When calculated together with the printing price required by the printing bureau, including paper and salaries of supervisors, the price is not expensive. As for the current rise in the price of the conference, it was not expected at the beginning. The quantity of stamps ordered in the contract for five years is a total of 1.5 billion stamps, which is also the actual quantity needed in these five years. The outside world's transmission is compared annually, which is not in line with the facts. It is heard that the biggest reason why the bureau opposes the contract with the British company is that it will make the bureau unable to maintain itself. It is found that there are a total of 1,500 workers in the bureau, but only 300 people can print stamps. Even if all the stamps are handed over to the bureau to print, it cannot maintain the livelihood of the whole bureau. Moreover, the bureau is set up by the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Finance does not hand over the printing of stamps, tax tickets, government bonds, bank notes, etc. Is it because the bureau's technology is not sophisticated and the machinery is old? It can be known by more than half. Moreover, when the contract was signed with the British company, the political situation in the north was chaotic, and the situation of the bureau was like that. The post office cannot but be especially cautious about the most important stamps.</p>
<h3>Wang's Illness Slightly Improved</h3>
<p>(Question) How is Minister Wang's condition recently? (Answer) I came to Shanghai with the minister in the same car on the 15th of the month. At that time, the minister felt unwell. The next day, he had a high fever, and he has not gotten out of bed until today. However, the fever has subsided a little. Now the doctor advises him to stay in the hospital for recuperation, but the minister thinks that there are many undecided matters in the ministry, so he cannot stay in Shanghai for a long time. In about a few days, when his body feels slightly recovered, he will return to Beijing to take charge of affairs.</p>

<h3>Cheng Yongxi Still Sentenced to Garrison Headquarters After Retrial</h3>
<p>Police Request to Retain Right to Appeal</p>
<p>Cheng Still Detained in Police Station as a Result</p>
<p>Cheng Yongxi, a Western doctor who hangs his shingle at 535 Baker Road, was detained and sent to the Special District Local Court by the Municipal Public Security Bureau in conjunction with the Xinzha Police Station in November last year on suspicion of being a communist. After several trials, the court ruled on December 10 that Cheng was to be taken to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Afterwards, the police argued that according to the agreement, evidence must be presented for all cases to be transferred, and after investigation by the court, the transfer can be made. However, the Public Security Bureau did not present evidence to prove the case, so they appealed, filed a lawsuit, and objected simultaneously. After deliberation by the Higher Branch Court, it was ordered that the original disposition be revoked and a retrial be conducted. Last month, Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court for a retrial. The Public Security Bureau presented evidence, saying that Cheng Yongxi participated in the riots in Guangzhou at the end of 1926 and worked in the Red Army Hospital, recruiting Luo Haifeng. Now Luo has been arrested and confessed to Cheng Yongxi, and so on. When questioned, the defendant Cheng Yongxi confessed that in the autumn of 1926, he was a military doctor in Zhang Fakui's army. After following the army from Hankou to Guangzhou, he resigned and transferred to the Guangzhou Health Bureau. He never joined the Red Army Hospital, and so on. The court ordered an investigation and re-verification. Now the Special District Court has obtained a reply from the Guangzhou Municipal Government, saying that Cheng Yongxi resigned from the Health Bureau on February 18, 1927, but he is a loyal element, and it was not stated whether he joined the Red Army. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Wu opened the second criminal court for a continued trial. The Public Security Bureau sent Inspector Tang Bao to file a case, still requesting the transfer. However, Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, opposed the transfer, saying that the Guangzhou Municipal Government's document stated that Cheng was a loyal element and presumably had no communist suspicions. The defendant also hired a lawyer to defend him. Judge Wu verified the confession and ordered Cheng Yongxi to be returned to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation and sent to the Songhu Garrison Command for investigation. Hearing the order, the police lawyer declared in court that he requested to retain the right to appeal. During the appeal period, the defendant should be returned to the police station. Judge Wu then reordered that the police lawyer's request in court to temporarily return Cheng Yongxi to the police station during the appeal (seven days) should be approved.</p>
<h3>Chen Kengran Countersues Xue Qishi for Extortion</h3>
<p>Xue Qishi's Broken Finger is Pitiful</p>
<p>Judge Advises Giving a Few More Coins</p>
<p>Greatly Hopes for Reconciliation Between the Two Parties</p>
<p>Xue Qishi, a former actor at the Shanghai Youlian Film Company, sued Chen Kengran, the manager of the company, for assault in the Special District Court the other day. Because Chen was out of town filming and had not returned, there was no confrontation, etc., which was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, Chen had returned to Shanghai for the case and sued Xue Qishi for extortion. The complaint stated that the defendant had worked as a temporary actor at the Youlian Film Company set up by the plaintiff. After the work was completed, he used the excuse that he had been injured on duty and repeatedly sent letters to demand money. The company had given him 350 yuan. Unexpectedly, the defendant repeatedly sent letters of intimidation, superficially demanding work assignments and actually demanding money. He also told the company's staff Chen Shaomin, Zhu Shaoquan, Wang Yongzeng, etc., that if his wishes were not met, he would definitely shoot and kill the plaintiff's entire family with a pistol, and finally shoot himself, and so on. Yesterday, Presiding Judge Feng Shide opened the court for trial. According to the plaintiff Chen Kengran, the manager of Youlian Film Company, he was repeatedly extorted by the defendant. The defendant was a temporary employee in the company. During the filming of the film Red Butterfly in 1928, he was injured. At first, because he saw that he was pitiful, he lent him 350 yuan. Afterwards, ten yuan or five yuan were often given to him. Recently, he came to borrow 500 yuan, and his attitude was very strong. He also said to the company's staff Zhu Shaoquan, Chen Shaomin, and Wang Yongzeng that he would shoot and kill me, and so on. The court asked if you were afraid when you heard the words "shoot and kill"? Have you seen a pistol? Chen replied, "Of course I am afraid after hearing the words 'shoot and kill', because he is a single person and his address is uncertain. As for whether he has a pistol, I don't know." Then, witness Zhu Shaoquan was called. According to his confession, he was a stagehand in Youlian. The defendant came in March to borrow money from the manager, but he repeatedly did not meet him. He left a message saying that he would come back to say something in the evening and asked him to come to the beef shop Hongchangxing in Malishi where the defendant lived, otherwise he would be impolite. As for what happened after that, he could not know because another colleague, Wang Yongzeng, went to contact him. Wang Yongzeng was recalled, saying that Xue came to the company to borrow money from the manager and asked the manager to go. The manager sent me. The first time I went, I didn't meet him. The second time I went, he said that he was injured while filming and wanted to borrow 500 yuan, because he had no money and nothing to do and it was difficult to make a living. If he was not allowed, he would commit suicide, but before dying, he would definitely shoot and kill Chen Kengran and his family, and then leave a bullet to kill himself. The third time I went to tell him that the manager would sue him. He said that I would sue him too. I also advised both parties to settle the matter for 150 yuan, and so on. Because the defendant Xue Qishi was ill after appearing in court the other day, the reason for his absence was stated by his representative lawyer. He also said that after handling this case, a representative from Youlian came to the office to request reconciliation, but our lawyer did not allow it. Chen Kengran declared that this did not happen. The judge then advised him to give a few more coins and reconcile. Then he adjourned the court and changed the date to Saturday, the 5th, for a retrial.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Guns and Ammunition Found in the Lonely Star Film Company</h3>
<p>No Municipal Government License</p>
<p>The Lonely Star Film Company at 505 West Sports Club Road was raided yesterday by police officers dispatched by the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, and a large number of guns and ammunition were found. This matter was first reported by Patrolman Liu of the Bazhiqiao Branch of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau. After receiving the news, he immediately reported it to Director You Bolu, who ordered Patrolman Niu Kaiping to lead the police to investigate. Twenty rifles, 712 bullets, one box cannon, four submachine guns, and one pistol, which was used by Manager Huang Wenjun for self-defense, were all found without licenses. When asked, the people in the company said that they were used for filming movies. The source of the guns and ammunition was said to be that Li Mingyang, the director of the Security Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, transported them to the Shanghai Arsenal for repair. The patrolmen and others then took the guns and ammunition, together with the staff Wang Naiding and Zichun, back to the office. After Director You's interrogation, the company was found to have privately stored guns and ammunition without a municipal government license, which was improper. He ordered the case to be transferred to the Judicial Section for verification.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers Association Sends Letter to the Public Works Bureau Requesting Punishment of Secret Agents for Negligence</h3>
<p>Speaking Out Against the Shooting of Shen Yunjie</p>
<p>The Taxpaying Chinese Association sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, We are writing in response to a letter received by the Association from lawyers Yang Lizhi and Zhang Jiahui, agents of Shen Jiting (as seen in the previous report), and so on. After investigation, the case is indeed as stated in the letter, and there are three points that can be used as the basis for the Association to file a protest: (1) The secret agent did not fulfill his responsibility to identify the person clearly. If he is not blind, he should be held responsible for negligence. However, if the secret agent is indeed blind, your bureau should be held responsible for employing the wrong person. (2) After Shen Yunjie was shot and fell to the ground, the detective should have immediately stepped forward to arrest him. However, he repeatedly shot a person who had lost the ability to resist more than ten times, even though he was a real robber. This shows his disregard for humanity and the law. (3) The secret agent knew afterwards that it was wrong to kill someone, and then he instigated Wang Yongtai's shop staff to identify Shen Yunjie as a robber on the spot. This shows that the shooting of Shen Yunjie was not due to negligence, but was close to premeditation or intentional. His false accusation of a good person as a robber can be inferred. Furthermore, because of the occurrence of this case, the Association has something to say to your bureau. That is, if you arrest robbers and encounter armed resistance, you should open fire in self-defense, which is also excusable under the law. However, if you shoot arbitrarily and accidentally injure or kill pedestrians, so that the robbers can escape, this will open the door to the practice of shooting innocent people out of malice and accusing them of being robbers who resist arrest, in order to achieve their revenge and seek credit. This is what your bureau should seriously remedy. According to the previous letter, we hereby send this letter, hoping that you will investigate and send the secret agent to the court to be punished according to the law."</p>
<h3>American Investigation of the Chinese Egg Industry</h3>

It is reported that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has already sent a letter urging the Egg Factory Association to respond promptly, to serve as a reference for Ambassador Wu in negotiating the U.S. tax increase issue.</p>

<h3>Ye Zhongfang's Mother and Wife Request Withdrawal of Lawsuit Against Chen Xiuzhen</h3>
<p>Rescheduled for Hearing on Saturday</p>

The French Concession court held a hearing yesterday. Judge Zhu Qi Shengzuo first presided over the criminal court to hear the case of Ye Pengshi and her daughter-in-law accusing Chen Xiuzhen of assault and fraud. The plaintiffs did not appear. Dong Yu and Jiang Yiping, representing the lawyers, stated that the plaintiffs voluntarily requested to withdraw the case. The defendant's lawyer, Yao, stated that whether the case could be withdrawn should be considered in court. He noted that the plaintiffs' accusations were criminal in nature, and the case was important. Why had the plaintiffs not appeared for the hearing? The plaintiffs' lawyer replied that the plaintiffs had filed the lawsuit out of anger because Ye Zhongfang had disappeared. After the case in the Special District Court occurred, Ye Zhongfang returned to Shanghai from Peiping and came forward. Because the relationship between the parties had not broken down, they requested that the case be withdrawn to settle the matter. As for the defendant's counterclaim for abandonment and false accusation, the plaintiffs resided on Jiaozhou Road in the International Settlement, and the defendant should file the complaint with the jurisdictional yamen. Lawyer Yao stated that the crime occurred in the French Concession and should be prosecuted in the French Concession court. Judge Zhu ordered the hearing to be rescheduled to Saturday morning, at which time the plaintiffs would surrender themselves, and the matter would be investigated further.</p>

<h3>Jinlong Western Restaurant Owner Accuses Former Partner of Forging Documents</h3>
<p>Verdict Scheduled for This Morning</p>
<p>Chen Lianfu, the owner of the Jinlong Western Restaurant, located at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Xizang Road, recently retained lawyer E Sen to file a complaint with the Special District Court against Gu Youqing and Jiang A'er, accusing them of forging documents and attempting to incite a labor strike. The reason for the complaint was that the plaintiff had employed Gu Youqing as a partner but, due to poor business, had dismissed him on April 12 of last year. On April 14, Wang Ningcai, the manager of the Hengsheng Western Restaurant, also dismissed Jiang A'er for cause. Jiang then used a forged document from Gu to tell Wang Ningcai, "Jinlong dismissed a partner and its manager provided written evidence. Since you dismissed me, you should provide written evidence in the same manner." Wang refused and immediately confiscated the forged document. He then went to question Gu about whether the document was created by him. Gu was shocked to hear this. After discussion, it was discovered that Gu had forged the document in order to present it to the labor union, hoping to incite workers and damage business credit. Therefore, the lawsuit was filed. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide held a hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court. The plaintiff Chen Lianfu recounted the past events, and lawyer E presented a letter, stating that it was a threatening letter sent by the Western Restaurant Industry Preparatory Committee to Chen. He now requested that the lawsuit against Jiang A'er be withdrawn. Gu Youqing testified, "I was dismissed because I joined the labor union. The labor union required a note from the owner when resigning, so I asked Chen for it. Chen told me to draft it, so I drafted the base and gave it to Chen. It was not forged." Jiang A'er completely denied the charges. Witness Wang Shengxiang testified that he was a waiter in the Central Western Restaurant and a member of the Preparatory Committee, proving that Gu Youqing was also a founder of the labor union. It was an oral decision of the Labor Union Committee that Gu should draft a note to Chen asking for a note to be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate the resumption of work.

<h3>Continued Hearing in the Case of Malfeasance by the Water Patrol Captain</h3>
<p>The trial of Water Patrol Captain Xu Yan for malfeasance continued yesterday afternoon, presided over by Judge Shen. The judge asked Deputy Captain Bin Menggan, "Who handles the cases in your office?" (Answer) "The gatekeeper records it on the spot, and then the captain handles it." (Question) "Who handled the case on September 14?" (Answer) "The case file and conclusion were written by the gatekeeper; I wrote it because the captain was absent, so I took his place. As for the evidence, the gatekeeper filled it in on the spot, recording how much was delivered." (Question) "How could the evidence show 45 packages, when Xu Yan took 150 packages?" (Answer) "I only knew about 45 packages. This was reported in an anonymous letter." At this point, the judge asked Xu Yan who wrote the book for processing cases. (Answer) "There are four people on duty in rotation: Chen Baozhen, Wang Hongnian, Li Cunrong, Li Fengqi, etc." The judge said, "This is the first case, and the book has been retrieved and is under investigation. What about the delivery of seven hundred boxes of red pills by the sub-unit on October 5?" (Answer) "This was received by the rotating officer, and there was no such thing." The judge asked Jiang Shihe, "What do you do and what does your job title mean?" (Answer) "It's like a recorder." (Question) "What about handling cases?" (Answer) "Patrol officer on duty." (Question) "Who was on duty on September 14?" (Answer) "I don't remember. It's whoever is on duty." The judge asked Zhang Xiaogou, "How many years have you been running a small goods business?" (Answer) "I don't." (Question) "If you don't run a business, how did you deliver goods to Xu Yan?" (Answer) "I don't know the captain." (Question) "You don't necessarily have to know the captain." (Answer) "I'm in the barge business." (Question) "Do barges carry small goods?" (Answer) "They carry hides and flour." (Question) "If someone asks you to carry something else, do you carry it?" (Answer) "Yes." At this point, the judge stated that he still needed to question the rotating officer and adjourned the debate, postponing the public judgment. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Urges China General Edison Company to Add Observatory Transformer Substation Ring Line</h3>
<p>The China General Edison Company's Xujiahui Observatory Transformer Substation does not have a ring line. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities previously ordered the company to install it quickly to ensure the safety of users' electricity. The company delayed in complying. On March 15, the high-voltage materials of the Sacred Heart Cathedral were damaged, causing a power outage in the Xujiahui area for nearly two hours. On the 19th of this month, power was cut off for half a day due to the replacement of power poles. If the transformer substation had installed the ring line earlier, these long power outages would not have occurred. It was learned yesterday that the Bureau of Public Utilities has ordered the company to add the ring line to the transformer substation and not to delay further.</p>
<h3>Trial of the Case of Rent Increase in Lizhong Alley Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, over 140 tenant households in Lizhong Alley, located at the end of Yuezhou Road, Hongzhen Fei Hong Road in this city, previously filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court against the landlord Chen Changkun for illegal rent increases, requesting the court to uphold the validity of the contract. Yesterday, the District Court summoned both the plaintiff and the defendant to appear in the Seventh Court for trial, presided over by Guo Shouyi, the head of the First Civil Court. The tenant representative Zhu Wenxin reported on the "past events and requested that the written contract of Jukangzhuang be valid and that rent cannot be increased within two years." Zhou, the lawyer representing the defendant Chen Changkun, claimed that he "completely denied the demands of the plaintiff and filed a counterclaim, stating that gold is valuable and silver is cheap, the cost of living is high, and the rent received is not enough to cover the interest on the purchase price and the pursuit of arrears of rent in the alley." Chen Honglai, the agent for the plaintiff, refuted this by saying, "When the house was bought, the landlord already knew the rent standard and should have had a proper budget. It should not be added to the tenant after the fact." He also cited the provisions of Article 254 of the Civil Code: "When the lessor transfers real estate to another person, the contract concluded with the lessee shall continue to be valid." According to Shanghai custom, before the dispute is resolved, rent should not be pursued, and each tenant should deposit the rent in the bank. At this point, Judge Guo believed that the tenants' reasoning was sufficient and said to the defendant Chen Changkun, "The written contract issued by Jukangzhuang should be valid for at least another year. How about increasing the rent after one year?" The defendant Chen Changkun absolutely did not agree. Because it was already noon, he ordered both parties to try to reconcile first and scheduled the continuation of the trial for 11:00 AM on the 30th of this month and declared the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Four-Year-Old Child Burned to Death in Fire</h3>
<p>Only Charred Bones Remain, a Tragic Sight</p>
<p>Zhou Jinsheng, 32 years old, a resident of Wangjiazhai, located half a mile northwest of the county seat of Baoshan County, makes a living by growing vegetables. His wife, Chen, has two children: an older daughter, 10 years old, and a younger son, only 4 years old. Around 3 AM the night before last, the couple got up and went to the fields to pick vegetables, preparing to sell them in the market. They left only the two children at home, asleep in bed. When the couple left, they placed a kerosene lamp in front of the bed. Unexpectedly, the two children turned over in their sleep, knocking the lamp over. In an instant, the fire burned the bed curtains, spreading to the bedding, objects, and the house. There were no neighbors nearby. When Zhou and his wife caught sight of the fire, they rushed back from the fields and shouted for help, but the fire had already engulfed the top and could not be extinguished. Later, the fire brigade in the city heard the news and drove to extinguish the fire, destroying five tiled houses in total. When the fire broke out, Zhou's 10-year-old daughter was able to escape from the fire, but the 4-year-old son did not escape and died in the flames. Afterwards, Zhou and his wife found the body among the rubble in the fire site. The skin and flesh of the body had been completely burned away, leaving only a charred skeleton with exposed organs, a tragic sight.</p>

<h3>Officials of the Anti-Narcotics Association Request Investigation of Those Falsely Accusing Ms. Jia Huang Hui of White Opium Case</h3>
<p>The entire staff of the China National Anti-Narcotics Association, believing that their Director-General Ms. Jia Huang Hui (also known as Mrs. Bai Zhiying) has been falsely accused of drug trafficking, which has been publicized at home and abroad, and has recently been proven untrue by the responsible parties and the Hong Kong government, believes that those who fabricated and falsely accused her should be thoroughly investigated in order to show fairness. They have sent a letter to the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Association. The original letter is excerpted as follows: "We are writing to inform you that the domestic and foreign newspapers have been filled with reports that our Director-General, Mrs. Huang Jia Hui (also known as Ms. Bai Zhiying), was caught by the Hong Kong Customs for trafficking morphine. Public opinion was in an uproar and the attention of people at home and abroad was focused on this. Because Mr. and Mrs. Huang went to Taiwan to inspect the truth about drug prohibition, it was temporarily difficult to understand the truth, so we advocated a clear investigation and resolved to telegram Mr. Huang to return to Shanghai to explain. Fortunately, Mr. and Mrs. Huang were able to safely return to Shanghai and obtained much evidence of the other party's conspiracy to frame Mrs. Huang. This has been reported to the Standing Committee and the Party Headquarters, and after review, it has been confirmed that she was falsely accused, and a certificate has been issued to prove the truth. As a result, the truth has been revealed and public opinion has shifted. Comrades far and near have sent letters of condolences, which shows that justice is in the hearts of the people and cannot be manipulated by those who distort right and wrong and confuse black and white. Recently, the Hong Kong government customs has also proven that there is no such thing. Mrs. Huang's innocent accusation has become even more obvious. Although the association has made a statement, those who conspired to falsely accuse her should be thoroughly investigated, and the accusations should be washed away as much as possible to protect the reputation of the association. Mr. Huang, the Director-General, who has been implicated due to his official duties, should be comforted to avoid discouragement. Also, this time, the other party's conspiracy has been exposed and their plan has failed. It is inevitable that they will launch a second attack on the association in order to achieve their goal of thwarting the anti-drug movement. Measures should be taken to prevent this, so that all staff members in the association do not feel threatened. The association has been entrusted by the public to eliminate drugs and fight against the drug demon. We have made many enemies, and the cadres are especially in the front line. Mr. Huang's false accusation is a lesson. We hope that you will carefully plan countermeasures to protect the comrades. The future of anti-drug is really dependent on it. We are urgently pleading, hoping that you will understand and reply." The 9th branch of the Party Headquarters in the three districts of this city believes that Mr. Huang has been working hard to fight drugs and has been falsely accused because of his official duties, which is very unfair. At present, the general meeting has resolved to submit a request to the superior Party Headquarters to investigate those who spread rumors and false accusations in order to show fairness and maintain anti-drug efforts.</p>

<h3>Good Method for Relieving Famine in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Emergency Relief Association for Shaanxi Disaster has received 20,000 copies of printed matter on the method of donating to relieve famine from the Nanyang Hosiery Factory (Knitting Industry Group) of the Trade Association, which are to be distributed so that those who are willing to donate can imitate the method to make and distribute them to the disaster victims, which can relieve famine. The method for relieving famine is listed below: Three liters of glutinous rice, washed and slowly fried. Three liters of sesame seeds, washed and slowly fried. First, grind the glutinous rice into powder, then grind it with the sesame seeds. Then use three pounds of red dates, boil them until soft, remove the skin and pits, mash and knead them into balls. Each ball should weigh five qian. Eat one ball a day, taken with boiling water. This can relieve hunger. If there is no glutinous rice or red dates, then japonica rice and black dates can be used. It is reported that the association plans to distribute the printed matter on the method of relieving famine to all sectors of society for review. The cost is low and can save many lives.</p>
<h3>Standard for Shallow Water Depth of Yangtze River</h3>
<p>The Yangtze River channel has ebbs and flows. Every winter, the water level is at its lowest. If Yangtze River ships are heavily loaded, they often run aground and have accidents. The Jianghan Customs River Patrol Commissioner has issued a notice, based on the ship management regulations, restricting all Yangtze River ship owners to comply. If they violate the regulations or overload, their customs clearance will be stopped. When the river water recedes, the channel becomes narrow and the harbor shallow, and navigation is dangerous. The Customs has stipulated the time for going up and down the river and set the water depth standards to prevent danger. The standards are as follows:</p>
<h3>Table for Calculating Water Depth Standards</h3>
<p>Between Jiujiang and Hankou, the regulated water depth limit is 4 feet and one-tenth. When clearing customs, the Jiujiang suspended water marker is the draft limit for two-way ships.</p>
<p>Between Jiujiang and Wuhu, the regulated water depth limit is 5 feet and two-tenths. When clearing customs, the Jiujiang Customs suspended water marker is the draft limit for downriver ships. For example, if a ship going upriver arrives at Xun and sees that the Jiujiang Customs suspended water marker is 7 feet and three-tenths, plus the regulated water depth limit between Jiujiang and Hankou of 4 feet and one-tenth, then the ship's upriver draft should not exceed 11 feet and four-tenths. For example, if a ship going downriver arrives at Xun and sees that the Jiujiang Customs suspended water marker is 7 feet and three-tenths, plus the regulated water depth limit between Jiujiang and Wuhu of 5 feet and two-tenths, then the ship's downriver draft should not exceed 12 feet and five-tenths. Attached is a comparison table of feet and inches: One-tenth of a foot equals 1.2 inches. Six-tenths of a foot equals 7.2 inches. Two-tenths of a foot equals 2.4 inches. Seven-tenths of a foot equals 8.4 inches. Three-tenths of a foot equals 3.6 inches. Eight-tenths of a foot equals 9.6 inches. Four-tenths of a foot equals 4.8 inches. Nine-tenths of a foot equals 10.8 inches. Five-tenths of a foot equals 6 inches.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Mr. Fei Tang's Report</h3>
<p>Abstract of Translation of First to Third Compilations (5)</p>
<h3>Chapter VIII</h3>
<p>Discussing the scope and outline of the administrative organization of the Public Concession, the administrative functions are described in detail, while the details of the political functions, such as the organization of the Ratepayers' Meeting, the Board of Directors, and various committees, as well as the methods of electing directors, are left to be studied in the fifth compilation, which discusses political issues.</p>
<h3>Chapter IX</h3>
<p>Discussing the general situation of the courts within the Public Concession, and examining the key points of the existing agreement on the organization of Chinese courts within the Public Concession, which came into effect on April 1, 1930. Particular attention is paid to the procedures for handling cases by the courts within the Public Concession, as stipulated in the agreement. These procedures differ from those used by Chinese courts outside the Concession. With the exception of certain cases, the right to initiate public prosecution of all criminal cases belongs to the Public Concession Police Force, represented in court by the police lawyer or his assistant. In cases where the prosecutor has the right to prosecute, the initial investigation should be conducted publicly, the defendant's lawyer should be allowed to make a statement in court, and the arrested person should be handed over to the court within 24 hours. Unless requested by a new-style Chinese court, a person arrested within the Public Concession must be investigated by a court before being handed over to an official body outside the Concession. The report points out that two difficulties have arisen regarding the provisions of the aforementioned agreement: (1) How to apply the Chinese laws routinely enforced by various administrative bureaus to the Public Concession; (2) How to implement the aforementioned provisions regarding the transfer of offenders to official bodies outside the Concession. The issue of applying the laws enforced by various Chinese municipal bureaus arises because the Chinese municipal bureaus request the arrest of citizens residing or doing business in the Public Concession. This request is related to the scope of the administrative powers of the Municipal Council within the Public Concession. The issue of transferring offenders to official bodies outside the Concession has also been discussed, with emphasis on upholding the Municipal Council's argument to provide necessary protection for Chinese residents within the Concession. This matter is important because, with the exception of new-style courts, no one may be transferred to an official body outside the Concession without a court investigation. The Municipal Council interprets the provision as requiring the court to be satisfied with all evidence of the offense committed outside the Concession before transferring the offender. The reason for this is that "if offenders arrested by the police force in the Public Concession can be freely transferred by the courts within the Concession to the civil or military authorities outside the Concession, the procedures for handling cases by the Concession courts as stipulated in the agreement, which are intended to protect the residents of the Concession, would be worthless. Furthermore, if arrest warrants are issued at the request of official bodies outside the Concession and the police force arrests offenders in accordance with the warrants, these official bodies may, against the wishes of the police force, use the police force to control innocent people within the Concession and subject them to the most serious illegal oppression." The report also raises a special case regarding the interpretation of the provision for transferring offenders to official bodies outside the Concession. After two appeals, the Municipal Council's lawyer ultimately obtained a ruling that before transferring the offender to the Public Security Bureau of the Chinese municipal government, the crime with which the offender is charged should first be investigated and a substantiated case should first be established. The Chinese government and military and political leaders once issued a "secret order" regarding this case to the Concession courts. The report also mentions this secret order. The general situation of implementing laws within the Public Concession is summarized as follows. From the above, it is clear that the complexity of the Public Concession's status in terms of both law and its implementation is extreme. In addition to the Land Regulations and their appendices, which are the only universally applicable laws in the Public Concession, the Concession has fifteen national courts implementing fifteen different legal systems. In addition, there are consular courts of an international nature handling cases against the Municipal Council. Chinese courts may exercise their jurisdiction over the large Chinese population within the Public Concession and over expatriates from countries without consular jurisdiction, making them extremely important (the extent of their importance can be measured by the large amount of work they have already done and the number of residents subject to their jurisdiction). All the difficulties lie not only in the fact that the laws enforced by these courts are uncertain and in the oppression exerted on these courts by official bodies outside the Concession, but also in the fact that a large number of courts exercise their jurisdiction within the Concession according to various different legal systems, thus complicating the situation in the Concession. The unifying forces between them are the Public Concession's police administration and the duties performed by the police lawyers and their assistants representing the Municipal Council. These lawyers are responsible for implementing the laws and punishing criminals entrusted to them by the Municipal Council. Foreign newspapers often widely publish information on cases handled by various courts within the Public Concession, while Chinese newspapers, although avoiding conspicuous publication in cases where the actions of Chinese official bodies are opposed or criticized, publish reports on cases heard by Chinese courts with a lenient attitude. Therefore, the courts themselves are often subject to public opinion. In terms of the general ruling system of the Public Concession, the Municipal Council is the administrative organ, and its power is limited by the organizational law based on treaties. The implementation of the Land Regulations and their appendices and the maintenance of the Concession's security rely on independent courts. The functions exercised by the Municipal Council are indeed legally restricted, and the interpretation of the law belongs to the courts. Therefore, within the Public Concession, unless official bodies outside the Concession request to participate in administrative power and are able to achieve their purpose, there is no exercise of dictatorial or autocratic power. The incompleteness of the Land Regulations and their appendices is an obstacle to the Municipal Council, and the administration of the bureau is therefore somewhat embarrassed and weakened by these shortcomings, but in general, the Municipal Council has been able to make its administration practical and effective in the past. If the courts are able to handle cases relating to the exercise of the Municipal Council's functions fairly and do not unduly interfere with the administration of the bureau by complying with the orders of official bodies outside the Concession or by seeking the interests of self-serving groups, then the Municipal Council will be able to continue its past achievements. The judgments in cases may be erroneous, but under the aforementioned normal circumstances, the system can still operate freely. However, if Chinese courts, due to complying with the orders of official bodies outside the Concession or succumbing to the threats of political organs, cannot handle various cases according to their true nature, then the stagnation of the Public Concession's administrative system will be expected. In short, although there are difficulties and ambiguities within the Public Concession, and fairness cannot always be maintained due to interference from official bodies outside the Concession, the spirit of the rule of law remains intact. Human rights and property rights are guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p>The civilian political system encompassed by the real estate procedures must rely on public opinion. Without adequate facilities to allow public opinion to be formed through open discussion, this system cannot be smoothly implemented. Therefore, Chapter 10 of the report discusses the freedom of speech of residents within the Public Concession, as well as the extent to which the Municipal Council's public announcements of municipal affairs can be used by the public for discussion. The report also addresses the relationship between newspapers and public affairs within the Public Concession. The report notes the differences in status between foreigners with consular jurisdiction, Chinese citizens, and foreigners without consular jurisdiction. It points out that foreigners with consular jurisdiction generally enjoy the same freedom of speech and publication as they do in their home countries. Chinese citizens and foreigners without consular jurisdiction are governed by Chinese law and are therefore subject to special restrictions. During the current period of political development, they must be subject to regulations restricting freedom of speech and publication. Furthermore, they are subject to the jurisdiction of Chinese courts.</p>
<p>The extent to which the Municipal Council discloses public affairs, as seen in the annual reports, published accounts, and the minutes of board and committee meetings published in the gazette, is mentioned. The issue of confidentiality in Municipal Council meetings is also considered. It is suggested that, under the current circumstances, the disclosure of the content of Municipal Council meetings would severely restrict the freedom to discuss many of the issues raised. From the public's perspective, the Municipal Council directors must be aware of a danger: regardless of how relevant the statements made and the issues debated are, once they are divulged, they could be misunderstood and used to incite the emotions of a segment of the population, potentially endangering public safety. From a private perspective, directors must also be aware of the risk of personal retaliation if their statements offend powerful individuals or their interests. This retaliation could take the form of social or economic oppression, and in times of unrest, could even lead to physical harm or damage to their property, endangering themselves, their families, or the businesses they represent. While both foreigners and Chinese are susceptible to this kind of personal danger, the Chinese are far more vulnerable than most foreigners. This is partly due to the aforementioned differences in legal status between Chinese and foreign residents, and partly because, as a general rule, Chinese are more susceptible to various forms of illegal social and economic oppression. This is partly due to the nature of Chinese social organization and partly because, although Chinese residents of the Public Concession benefit from the Concession's protection, their families or property outside the Concession are easily subject to attack.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Yesterday, I read in your newspaper's local news section a report about Xu Yuanxiang being sued by his concubine for abandonment. It contained phrases such as "accumulating concubines, seducing widows, and having a new favorite." I, for the sake of having offspring, did take concubines with proper matchmakers and witnesses, and I never committed any seduction. Furthermore, I have no new favorite. However, recently, a concubine was instigated to sue me in the local court, but this case was settled amicably on March 30, and Ms. Wu withdrew the case herself. The details in your newspaper's report are inaccurate. As it concerns my reputation, I am writing to clarify the truth. I hope you will publish this letter to the editor. Sincerely, Xu Yuanxiang. April 28th.</p>

<h3>The Morning Light Art Exhibition and the Chinese Painting Movement</h3>
<p>— By Fu Lisheng</p>
<p>I. Impressions from April</p>
<p>II. Trends in Modern Painting</p>
<p>III. The Morning Light's Contributions and Chinese Social Life</p>
<p>IV. The Development of the Chinese Painting Movement</p>
<p>I. Impressions from April</p>
<p>In April of the 20th year [of the Republic], I have already seen six art exhibitions: the White Goose Painting Exhibition, the New China Painting Exhibition, Yue Lun's Sculpture Solo Exhibition, the Tissot Painting Society Art Exhibition, the Second Art Garden Art Exhibition, and today's visit to the 5th Exhibition of the Morning Light Art Association. What impressions have these exhibitions given us? What kind of connection do they have with the Chinese art movement? These are things worth studying for those of us who study art.</p>
<p>All of Yue Lun's sculptural works, in terms of consciousness, naturally do not have any expression, but in terms of technique, they supply the novel trends of modern sculpture. Yue Lun's sculptural solo exhibition is a precursor to solo exhibitions by sculptors in China, breaking through a part of the dullness in the Chinese art world. This makes those of us who study art very happy and blesses the future of Chinese art. The Tissot Painting Society exhibition is also a precursor to Chinese pattern painting exhibitions, giving a good symbol to the development of Chinese crafts. Among them, Wu Shangjun's advertisement, taken from the Japanese reclamation in Mongolia, is a very rare good work. This trend gave us a very exciting sense of propaganda and created a great aversion to the Japanese. The White Goose Painting Exhibition, the New China Painting Exhibition, and the Art Garden Art Exhibition fully express that they (those artists) are "art for art's sake". However, in color, brushwork, and subject matter, there have been no special changes. They are still the same as the general forms of art from four or five years ago. Moreover, many writers have shown traces of degeneration. For example, Ms. Pan Yuliang's work in the first National Art Exhibition in the 18th year [of the Republic] had a very strong emotion flowing, which also meant that her work had life. However, her work in the Art Garden exhibition did not have life; it was just colors and threads that made such a thing. Mr. Wang Yachen's still life is not as beautiful and lovely as in his solo exhibition. These painting exhibitions very much showed that the Chinese painting movement was stagnating, and even degenerating. However, today (April 25), the 5th Exhibition of the Morning Light Art Association gave us a very good phenomenon and opened a new era.</p>
<p>II. Trends in Modern Painting</p>
<p>The trends in modern painting are very much inclined towards the public and very much inclined towards national consciousness. The reason is that art is not the creation of the artist's soul, art is not the expression of genius, and art is not the reproduction of nature. In these years, there are still people who advocate "art for art's sake". This is fundamentally not understanding the close relationship between art and life and uttering this kind of nonsense.</p>
<p>Art is the expression of the spirit of a nation, it is a reflection of the social life of an era. In Western countries, neo-primitivism and neo-realism, which express human life, have replaced the old ones. Therefore, every one of their works is inclined towards the dynamics of human emotions. A painting has a life in it, and art originates in human life, so its materials should be taken from human life. Every painting should be a reflection of a view of life. In other words, modern painting has already transcended the realm of nature and gone to human life.</p>
<h3>The Morning Light's 5th Exhibition's Contributions in the British Memorial Pagoda</h3>
<p>— By Zheng Zhaojia</p>
<p>Based on such a principle to observe the works of the Fifth Exhibition of the Morning Light Art Association, we very much publicly recognize that the works of the Morning Light Art Association are not contrary to the current era. In their 105 works, most of them are taken from human life.</p>
<p>The modern world's art scene is trending towards human life, and only the Morning Light Art Association in China is making such a contribution to us. How is this opening a new era in the history of Chinese art?</p>
<p>The works contributed by the Morning Light Art Association this time very much reflect Chinese social life, modern social life.</p>
<p>III. The Morning Light's Contributions and Chinese Social Life</p>
<p>China's social situation is still very chaotic. Although the military period has passed, it is still a period of political construction.</p>
<p>China is still being bullied by imperialism. The Shanghai concession fully demonstrates the accumulation of their (imperialist) violence. Mr. Yang Qiutai's "Sightings in Hongkou" positively depicts a Japanese soldier guarding the position behind which are barracks and armored vehicles. This painting is a rather rare one in this exhibition.</p>
<p>In recent years, some places in China have had natural disasters. Yu Zaisheng's "Displaced People" and Cheng Gan's "Victims of Disaster" very much express the suffering of the people in places with natural disasters. Other works such as "Bleeding," "Awakening," "Workers' Conference," "Crossing the Yellow River at Dawn," and "Meeting in Zhengzhou" are also very closely related to the Chinese revolution. In Yang Qiutai's "Awakening" and "The Masses", it is also showing that the Chinese nation is rising day by day. Huang Zhenzhong's "Impression of Changsha" and Hua Houjun's "Red Terror" very much express the rampant red bandits and communist sabotage of 1930 and 1931. Other works such as Xu Suling's "Nocturne," Zhu Yingpeng's "Dancer," Zeng Zhiliang's "Vendor" and "Farmer," and Lu Xiaoxia's "Flower Seller" all reflect the general nature of modern Chinese social life.</p>
<p>The tendency of the content of their works is closely connected with social life. If this exhibition is compared with other exhibitions, it will be felt that such movements as Yihua, Art Garden, and White Goose Art Movement Society (Lin Fengmian, etc.) are very backward. Moreover, in the techniques of the Morning Light, the special skills of each are also very much expressed.</p>
<p>IV. The Development of the Chinese Painting Movement</p>
<p>In the past, the Chinese painting movement very much expressed a bad phenomenon: not seeking progress in the consciousness of the works, but only paying attention to technique. In all the works, no consciousness can be found, only traces of color and lines. Therefore, the painting movement has not developed and has stagnated. The Morning Light Art Association exaggerated the Chinese painting movement which is in the process of developing at this exhibition that they released to us this time.</p>
<p>Past painters, such as Xu Beihong's nude depiction, Lin Fengmian's religious expression, Wang Jiyuan's and Wang Yachen's reproduction of nature, were all because they did not have the experience of social life, so they remained silent in the studio, so that the Chinese art world became a stalemate. Now, the Morning Light are all comrades who worked in political work during the revolutionary era, so their works have a new situation. This is giving us a very lesson: artists cannot leave political life. Although not everyone has to engage in political life, they should observe social life with calm eyes so that the painting movement does not stagnate.</p>
<p>The main trend of art is tending towards life. Painters who are "art for art's sake," if you do not transform, the times will abandon you.</p>
<p>The Chinese painting movement is developing and has already jumped out of the ivory tower.</p>
<p>The development of the Chinese painting movement is being promoted by the Morning Light Art Association.</p>

<h3>Continuing the French General Foch's Diary of the European War</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>To what extent could the British army accomplish this plan? Because his military advisor was not present, the Marquis Milner could not immediately reply to Mr. Clemenceau's question. However, he proposed that a meeting be convened again with the British generals on the 26th, the next day. We dispersed at the Kongbei at 5 PM, and decided to meet at Duri at 11 AM the next morning.</p>
<p>The next day, March 25, Commander-in-Chief Haig handed General Weygand a document in Abeville. In the document, he stated his requests and claims.</p>
<p>His request was "at least twenty divisions of French troops, crossing the Sham River, west of Amiens, immediately concentrated to defend against German attacks on the British army." This would be equivalent to deciding to move the British army's resistance to the west of Amiens. His claims were expressed clearly in the following sentence, that is, "The British army must fight and retreat and protect the ports of the English Channel."</p>
<p>This was a serious decision that failed to fully protect the interests of the Allied forces and gave a new blow to the morale of the British army, which was in a state of shock.</p>
<p>At the sudden onset of a critical moment of survival, the two commanders-in-chief encountered the responsibilities each bore to their own country. Now, unfortunately, each was most concerned with preserving his own army, and therefore retreated to his base, which was the best way to protect the interests of his own country. For the British army, this direction was the English Channel; for the French army, it was Paris and the interior of France. Each believed this to be the most urgent task, and the result was inevitably contradictory, and the so-called rescue of neighboring armies became an incidental responsibility.</p>
<p>The German army had only one goal in combat, while the Allied forces had two, that is, the British army fought for the ports, and the French army fought for Paris. The further apart the British and French armies fought, the greater the distance between them. The Allied commander was trending towards the separation of their armies, which was the main goal of the German army's combat. They risked everything to completely split the Allied forces. The Allied governments should bear most of the responsibility for this event. Therefore, if they do not actively participate in the war as soon as possible, we can only wait to die. They must clearly determine that the interests of the Allied forces are of paramount importance. They must establish an agency to control all armies in the theater of war to protect common interests and command joint forces.</p>
<p>On Sunday, March 4, at 3 PM, before General Petain issued an instruction recognizing his disagreement with Commander-in-Chief Haig, I automatically asked to see Prime Minister Clemenceau to present him with a statement requesting attention to the evolution of the war. I reiterated the need for military deployments that should be implemented immediately and for a war command agency that would issue orders and act on them. Otherwise, the Allied forces would be ill-prepared, ill-equipped, and uncoordinated in their command, and the future would be fraught with danger.</p>
<p>He received my statement, and the first thing he said was, "You're not abandoning me, are you? You, me, Haig and Petain have agreed, so what can I do?"</p>
<p>I replied, "No, Mr. President, I'm not abandoning you, but we should each bear our own responsibilities, and we can't delay any longer. That's why I submitted this statement."</p>
<p>I was the Chief of Staff of the French Army and also the military advisor to the French government. Serious events occurred frequently, and a disastrous defeat was imminent. I could not stand idly by. The time has come for each person to bear his responsibilities. The most important thing is for the French government to understand Prime Minister Clemenceau's patriotic enthusiasm, his extraordinary actions, and his frequent talks with General Petain or Commander-in-Chief Haig, which are not enough to maintain the long and difficult war of the Allied forces. To solve this problem, a command agency must be established immediately, with the sole purpose of commanding the Allied war. It should be publicly elected by the governments of the allied countries and be composed of experienced, capable, and prestigious people, assisted by appropriate staff, and should be responsible to the Allied governments. Otherwise, the Allied war will eventually be weakened by division and end in a disastrous defeat (to be continued).</p>
