<p>時評</p>
<h3>日軍暴行之擴大</h3>
<p>八日晚天津市突然發生暴徒襲擊市政府與公安局之鉅變。此一鉅變之所以發生。蓋由於一種恐怖之黑潮。正積極從東北方面西向而推進。雖其情勢。稍異於九月十八晚爆發之瀋陽事變。而其性質則恰無二式。</p>
<p>依據於日聯社九日東京電之說明。謂「今日暴徒自稱自治救國團。人數達數千。一時形勢有利。占領中國機關。然其軍械惡劣遂被軍隊壓迫。現今殆無可挽回。」同時再依據於駐津日軍司令部「此次變亂。爲中國内政上之騷擾。日軍不欲置喙」之聲明。以及日南陸相於九日臨時閣議中「天津事變爲中國内政上之抗爭」之報告。則一若此次天津之變亂。果眞僅由於中國内政騷亂之發動。而與日人無絲毫關係者。然而另一方面之事實。則明明爲（一）亂作之先。有日軍要求我警所讓出。（二）暴徒由日租界出動。並挾毛瑟槍在日軍司令部左近開槍。（三）亂作之後。日軍要求我軍警退離日租界三百米。（四）日軍實彈向華界轟擊。依據於此種種之事實之說明。則此次暴變之突發。究以某方面爲其發縱指使之罪魁。全世界人士。應不言而共喻。事實勝於雄辯。世人對此事件。今旣已獲得事實上之解答矣。日軍政界之嘵嘵置辯。力自表白。正徒顯其捉襟而露肘。「欲蓋彌張」。</p>
<p>國際聯盟十一月十六日日軍須完全撤退之决議。爲世人所共聞共見。十六日今已迫近。日人不僅表示屆時决不撤退軍隊。抑且繼續擴大其暴行。在東北則襲擊我黑省。與我馬占山旅發生激戰。使東北局勢又突形緊張。在關内則又有天津變亂之突發。并聞尙有積極擾亂我其他重要都市之陰謀。使我腹地徧處發生騷擾。以證實其「中國政局異常混亂。無力以保護各國僑民」之宣傳。凡此暴行。一方面固證明日帝國主義者已具破壞世界和平之决心。而另一方面則更證明其絲毫不介意於國聯正義之勸告。抑且正不惜予國聯之威信以極其酷毒之重創。中國愛護國聯。愛護世界和平之國民。對此日益擴大之暴行。誠不勝其憤恨之内激。而同時對於國聯之威信。爲日人一手所葬送。更不勝其悲觀與惋惜。</p>
<p>吾人於體解此一次天津變亂爆發之根因之後。敢提出下列兩項之意見。第一。國聯應即日提前召集會議。并應具有最後以一種不可少之强制力。裁制日軍之暴行。并維持國聯之威信與世界之和平之决心。</p>
<p>第二。我國國民應人人具有馬占山旅長抗暴禦侮之精神。隨時隨地準備持正義與擾亂世界之惡魔作殊死之戰。</p>
<p>日本經濟學家及著名評論家高橋龜吉氏嘗有言。「日本對華武斷政策。我以爲恰如落水者連稻草都想抓住一根的模樣。只是表示出日本帝國主義者。漸次失望而焦燥罷了。武斷政策主張者雖已動搖。表面上雖還在裝腔作勢。但其手足無措之窘態。則已明白可見。」以日帝國主義今日之處境。及其繼續未已之暴行。反證高橋氏之言。彌覺其見解之正確。吾人但須有爲正義而犧牲之决心。强權終當陳尸於公理之足前。對意料以内之天津禍變。旣無足憂更復奚懼。</p>

<h3>日本對於東北問題之謬論（二）</h3>
<p>▲缺少對於滿洲的認識安東代表荒川氏</p>
<p>予見大阪的實業家那種異常强硬的態度、覺得是不十分適當、現在聽到政府當局的意見、予雖甚覺滿意、但認爲還有一缺點、即一般國民缺少對於滿洲的正確認識、便是國際聯盟以及幣原外相自身、也有這同一的缺點、這是由於一般國民缺少認識的反映、這一點本來住在滿洲的國人應當負責、但我常疑惑是否因日本國民性不適於往來海外、而且目前放棄滿蒙之論調之唱出、美國的某上院議員曾說、「中國若不裂土予日本、則將發生戰爭、」即張作霖部下已故的王永江、也說「疆土狹小的日本、得了朝鮮而望滿洲、是所當然、但假使日本肯稍加限制其治外法權、中國人亦極爲歡迎、」日本與滿蒙的關係之重大、即因其關係日本國家的生存權、假如能明瞭此一意義、列强當亦不至怎樣干涉我們對滿蒙的行動了、</p>
<p>▲聯盟列國缺乏對滿蒙的了解我國外務省太疎忽了末廣博士</p>
<p>予在九月十八日的事情發生以前、即反對用兵力解决滿蒙問題、因爲我國的智識階級和青年們、對於滿蒙還不十分注意、如滿鐡並行線問題、吉會線問題等、他們都還未能十分理解、在動員國民之先、應該使國民澈底的理解這些問題、在前年太平洋會議中列國都不注意滿蒙問題、予雖以爲必須先使列國理解此一問題、但今旣已實力發動、木已成舟、兹後惟有計圖怎樣澈底的有利之解决了、我國政府對此一問題、現有兩種態度、一·在滿鐡沿線附屬地外之重要地點、仍駐屯軍隊、保障交涉、二·爲保護日本國民的權益之故、目前雖撤兵、但在一二年間、當仍將發生衝突、斯時若先得列國諒解之後、再行出兵、列國當可認爲正當的行爲、但無論那一點、我以爲此問題非一朝一夕所能解决、所以在解决此問題之前、應當先向國民大衆擴大宣傳滿洲的事情、另一方面在列國了解了「日滿關係」之後、其中總有一國能予我國以同情而切實互相連絡、今日之外務省、實未注意及此、因此對於此次美國列席國聯行政會的問題、没有一國幫忙日本的、列國都不認我國對於滿洲是處於特殊地位、這事是最令人棘手我以爲德意志和意大利兩國、有作我國的友邦的可能、因牠們的處境與日本目前的處境相彷之故、我持此主張直至現在、但未能博得一個人的贊成、其次對於防禦華人排斥日貨、假如這排貨運動是由於中國人民自動發生、則應付頗爲困難、但事實决非如此、我認爲反日會之策謀、實以政府爲其背景、所以將來或許還會發生撤廢領判權等之事、對這問題日本若堅决反對、列國勢必贊同造成一個膺懲警覺中國當局的機會、此即所以防禦中國排斥日貨運動之道、</p>
<p>▲最好在聯盟列國中求得一友邦稻畑氏</p>
<p>予以爲忘掉了Prpagand（宣傳）這一事情、確是一個錯誤、我們今已明白聯盟毫不諒解日滿的關係了、宣傳是國防策之一、但事情已弄成僵局、我們不得不認爲强硬的手段用得太早了、現雖有助成滿洲獨立并切實互相提携的計劃、但我於其能否成功、極爲懷疑、此種計劃、使列國都存「日本併吞滿洲」之疑心、必將使日本處於孤立的地位、就聯盟理事會的經過、在出席的各國中、我們未必不能得一二友邦、若果能之、將極足以促進時局的展開、</p>
<p>▲上海抵制日貨所受的損失已達</p>
<p>一億五千萬元受累者非僅大阪</p>
<p>一處是全日本的損害小倉氏</p>
<p>前次予聽得東京大阪的實業家主張堅持强硬態度到底、曾有人對此一主張懷疑、這是因爲没有正當認識大阪和中國的關係之故、對華貿易、實與我國有極重要的關係、滿洲事情發生以來、在上海方面所遭的損失已、達一億五千萬元、大阪的苦痛、即日本全國的苦痛、爲擁護在滿蒙的我國更大的權益、全國一致籌謀圓滿解决的對策、對排日方面、我有兩項意見、一·兩國間的貿易無論到怎麽地步、無論用怎麽的手段來抵制日貨、終有些出路、故無須過於憂慮、二·中國人的性質、若使迫之過甚、其結果或他們自己也要受累、但無論如何、此問題之解决、終是世界的問題、如能得聯盟和美國的諒解、自能得圓滿的收塲、最近美國的態度、已頗同情於我、故此問題、將來或能獲得圓滿之解决、</p>
<p>▲統一國論最爲急務中山氏</p>
<p>現在對於求得列國的諒解、并不成多大問題、今滿洲之事、木已成舟、我們須要考慮日本的過去現在和將來、强固國民的意志以統一國論、最爲當前之急務、連絡友邦爲後步之問題、聯盟如有足以使我們遺憾之點、我國當一致堅决反對、五月四日在大阪舉行的商工會議、曾有一意見、謂中日兩國國民之共存共榮、必依賴兩國國民相互間精神的諒解和經濟提携、纔能得成功、基於此一立塲、故有「設置對華問題調查委員會之提議、」而有調查會之設置、並且對於此次事件、爲擁護日本正當的權利、而編製了對華問題一覽表、我們目擊當前的排日暴狀、應當抛棄温和的手段、以積極的手段來應戰、</p>
<p>▲當今國民的耳目應集中於滿蒙問題蘇峯翁又說</p>
<p>予前日在岡山廣島和神户各處講演對華問題、得到意外的盛况、如昨夜在神户、聽衆多至二千五百人、這足以證明日本國民對於此次對華問題之熱烈、日本人火一般熱的愛國心、肯拚命於正義、不愧爲很靈敏肯受敎的國民、故請憂慮國論不能一致的諸位放心、這是我對於此次旅行的感想、（未完）</p>

<p>醫家張聾𦗭之名、婦孺咸知、今雖逝世多年、其子孫輩尙皆克紹箕裘、傳斯衣缽、故仍保持聾𦗭名號、致原有（張若星字祝三）之名、反不甚爲病家所注意、外間因張氏三代俱屬名醫、自必富有、不免爲匪類垂涎、有綁匪首領某、近欲綁架張星若、於半月之前、即糾集黨羽、變名易姓、屢至新閘路愛文義路之中南鴻祥等旅館、詭稱旅客特闢房間、秘密會議、直至前日上午、又在鴻祥旅館二十號房間内</p>
<p>議决進行計劃定於當日下午三時、派王阿六·朱阿四·及阿二·出外租賃汽車、以迎接學生爲由、騙汽車夫開往滬西華界虹橋路中山路附近楊村學校門前、將車夫以暴力制止、另派有駕駛汽車經騐之張阿毛、先乘脚踏車馳往該學校左近河畔、俟王等將汽車夫監視後、即駕該汽車疾趨平橋路、止於張醫生門前、至三時半、則派數匪自鴻祥旅館出發、直奔張家、將張擄出、由停至門前之汽車承載、預計四時後</p>
<p>肉票當已到手故特着王阿六等須將汽車夫監視、至日晡才可縱之、此項計劃、佈置頗爲周妥、抑且面面顧到、調遣旣畢、各匪以爲自能手到擒來、故無不奉令唯謹、迨時過午、張阿毛首先租得脚踏車、乘之出發、向指定方面而去、繼之者爲王阿六·朱阿四·及阿二·等三匪、依照綁匪軍師之策略、同往海格路、向該地東新汽車行租賃汽車、謂赴滬西迎接學生歸家、當租就第一萬二千四百十九號汽車一輛、由該行車夫施楨祥司機、王等三匪登車後指揮、施即開駛、及達楊村學校對面、遂命停車、該處荒僻異常、</p>
<p>田中蘆葦叢生絕似青紗幛、一匪突然袖出手槍、禁止施聲張、餘則各出潛帶之蔴繩巾布等物、將施手足緊縛以巾堵塞其口、而後拽至蘆葦叢生藏匿、三匪持械包圍監視、施因完全失却抵抗能力、惟有一任擺佈、時徘徊河畔之張阿毛、見初步計劃、已告成功、隨棄脚踏車、躍登該汽車、馳往平橋路張宅門首停候四句餘鐘、非唯不見其黨往擄張醫、</p>
<p>反來大隊探員正遲疑間、而探員已將其包圍、詢以有無司機執照、張匪莫知所對、遂被拘執、蓋彼等在鴻祥所决之策、已全部爲戈登路捕房探員皮少昌偵悉、以匪旣約定三時舉事、故皮探員則報告捕頭、於二時半即派華探長沈崇禮·探目劉春樹·張良·探員李文翰·偕西探克勞夫開納台等密往該旅館、當在二號房内將于長友（即王長貴）李阿其·王德普·及方欲入室之張菊先、一併拏獲、搜查之下、抄得手槍三支、子彈二十四粒曁書就之致張醫家屬、</p>
<p>索欵取贖信函一封、此函原定俟將張醫架至匪窟、始行付郵、遂一併帶入捕房、經各匪供明彼等計劃後、該探員因往張宅左近、查拏駕車之匪、初固不知張阿毛係同黨、及詢悉、並無開車照會、乃疑而拘之、該匪當場承認不諱、並供出王阿六等尙將汽車夫、施楨祥監視於楊村學校附近情事、中西探員立即投六區警署、聲請協助、經區長加派警探按址前往、及到達時、阿二正在對王朱兩匪言、</p>
<p>此際諒已得手若二人可先歸、將手槍交余、由余將此車夫略再監視、即釋彼去、言時並接受王等手槍、乃一反顧、見大隊探員蜂擁而來、遂不及知照王朱、握槍乘脚踏車如飛而逸、探員追趕一程、卒以車快、致被逃遁、王阿六則當場拿獲、朱阿四避於荒塚之間、且此時忽有槍聲砰然、各探員認係朱開槍拒捕、於是西探開納台亦放一槍、而華探目張良、</p>
<p>連續射擊六槍將朱匪左肩右臂各傷一處、該匪纔束手就縛、因其臂傷頗重、彈未透出、即送醫院治療、王匪暫行寄押該管警署、容請法院備文移提、潛伏叢草中之施楨祥、則由探員解除束縛、帶至平橋路、使仍駕原車歸去、嗣又續在鴻祥旅館前後門口拘獲匪黨李夢飛·陳洪生·王志方·三名、連同前獲之五匪、統於昨晨解送第一特區地方法院、由馮世德推事提審、捕房律師王耀堂聲明以懲治綁匪法、對各匪起訴、惟尙須調查、請求改期、旋由中西探員報告破案經過情形、馮推事遂向各被告略訊姓名·年籍·畢、諭均收押、候查明並提到王阿六、再行定期研訊、</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>▲日本人不識黄太玄</p>
<p>日人自命爲執東亞藝術之牛耳。推橋本關雪爲畫苑巨擘。朝野重視之。獨於我國畫家。頗少許可。惟吳倉碩王一亭錢瘦鐡等。咸爲欽佩。士紳之家。靡不懸三尺畫軸。即使貧困而無力購三尺眞跡者。亦以石印之畫懸於壁。以自示風雅。吳生前之潤格屢增。職是故也。王每年硯田所入達二萬餘金。日人居其半。錢之時時東渡。蓋亦欲賺日人之錢耳。去秋錢游黄山歸。日商土屋。出四百金棠錢畫黄山圖於六摺屏風上。錢友黄太玄爲題長歌。比示土屋。大不愜意。錢爲之另易一幅。翌日土屋復至。錢出屏示之曰。幸不辱命。易一幅矣。土屋改容謝曰。嚮不識黄君。今始知爲橋本關雪作叙者。敢請并付余。錢微晒曰。黄君固倔强者。聞君見惡。已撕去矣。土屋再三請。乃饋百金。取畫雀躍而去。聞者莫不笑土屋之前倨後恭。而以關雪爲依歸也。</p>

<h3>思想的母親</h3>
<p>行動是思想的母親。科學是從把戲中玩出來的。</p>
<p>杜威先生分析反省的思想之過程列舉了如下的步驟：（一）困難之感覺；（二）審定困難之所在；（三）設法解决；（四）在許多方法中選一最有效的試試看；（五）屢試屢騐之後再下斷語。這反省的思想之過程便是科學思想之過程。</p>
<p>我拿杜威先生的道理體騐了十幾年，覺得他所叙述的過程好比是一單極的電路，通不出電流。他没有提及那思想的母親。這位母親便是行動。路走不通纔有困難。走不通而不覺得困難，這是庸人。連脚都没有動而心裏却虚造出萬千困難解决不止，這是科學家。所以我要提出的修正是在困難之前加一行動之步驟。於是科學的整個生活之過程便成了：行動生困難；困難生疑問；疑問生假設；假設生試騐；試騐生斷語；斷語又生行動，如此演進於無窮。懶得動手去做，那裏會有正確的思想産生，又何能算是科學生活？</p>
<h3>顧名思義録</h3>
<p>— 石顔也</p>
<p>▲日内瓦暴日冦我東北。我人迷信公理。訴諸國際聯盟會。國聯會所在瑞士之日内瓦。此日内瓦三字。顧名思義。殊覺危險可慮。蓋日内瓦者。日内瓦解之謂也。何物日内瓦解。曰。國聯也。國聯以何日内瓦解。曰暴日强項。國聯限令撤兵。始以兩週。繼以二十一日。雖以十三對一。暴日仍悍然不顧也。國聯三次集會。已定十六日舉行矣。吾必其仍作空言。無奈暴日何也。歐陸之於遠東。鞭長莫及。益以各邦俱在多事之秋。今又理事會不能理事。則所謂國聯者。自祇有日内瓦解之一法耳。嗚呼。有名無實之國聯。瓦解之不足惜也。獨痛我政府日日引頸企足於日内瓦。選延時日。致予暴日在東北盤旋之機。作根深底固之謀。夢想賴日内瓦之助者。竟以日内瓦自召國家日内瓦解之憂矣。可怕哉。日内瓦。</p>
<p>▲土肥原東北三省。長白山興安嶺之間。遼河松花兩水縱横。土地肥沃。一片平原也。暴日之謀攫此肥沃平原久矣。此次入冦。由東京傳密令於彼駐遼軍司令本莊繁者。其人爲土肥原也。彼思攫我土地肥沃之平原。而又命土肥原奔走。顧名思義。其謀我土地之心。益彰彰明甚。嗚呼。土肥原一蒞我土。我東北之土肥原果非我有矣。</p>
<p>▲本莊繁暴日寇我東北之軍隊司令曰本莊繁。按莊。店之謂也。本莊繁者。本店事務紛繫之謂也。本莊統率賊兵。横行東北。暗無天日。無異開一黑店也。殺人放火。而又夥我土匪。結我國賊。爲所欲爲。自欣欣然曰。本店事務紛繁。而簡言之曰。本莊繁矣。</p>
<p>▲芳澤羅襦乍解。香澤微聞。暴日出席國聯代表芳澤。似一芬芳馥郁之可人兒也。以一妙女子窕窈於議席間。已芳澤醉人。又花言巧語以媚人。撒嬌裝痴以困人。彼黄髮隆準之輩。宜爲之迷。爲之屈。不能多說公道話矣。英雄難逃美人關。古今同慨。中外皆然。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>▲追踪哥倫坡的好男子。在一千九百三十一年年終。航海界中將有一件驚人的壯舉。引起全世界的注意。原來竟有人預備搭了仿照當年。哥倫坡探得美洲新大陸的那艘著名的「聖瑪利亞」而造成的船。“Santa　Maria”横渡大西洋。發起此舉的言是西班牙海軍中的一位軍官瞿利歐甘朗艦長。Captain　Don　Julio　Guillen他在二年以前。就在仿照着哥倫坡的「聖瑪利亞」督造一艘新船。以備陳列在塞維爾博覽會Serille　Exhibition中之用。他現在就打算搭了此船。渡過大西洋。并且沿用一千四百九十二年間哥倫坡航海的老法。並不利用一切新的機械與新的設備。這就是難能可貴的一點。眞足以追踪哥倫坡了。近年以來。雖常有人在海洋上冒險。他們所用的船。也許比這「聖瑪利亞」的副本要小得小。但他們都採用新的航海法。比老法究竟容易。如今甘朗氏正在籌備之中。我們很誠懇的祝頌他此行的成功。</p>
<h3>紀癖</h3>
<p>— 張炎</p>
<p>揚州某翁。有潔癖。日必沐浴一次。惟性吝而貪。每浴畢。必袖藏蔴布浴巾一條回。（早年浴堂浴巾用蔴布。近年始改毛巾。）堂倌久而生疑。乃留心偵察。始悉係翁所爲。因念其係老主顧。又以翁子貴顯。未便戳穿西洋鏡。遂輾轉向翁子叩訴苦衷。翁子豁達。亦不直尊翁所爲。於是承認每日償浴巾之值。翁於是大膽竊巾數十年。自以爲得計。日欣欣有喜色。翁故後。發現浴巾數十箱。因係濕時藏於密。已朽爛不堪。不能製孝衣。又不能作抹布。</p>
<p>乾嘉之際。揚州多書畫名人。如鄭板橋·羅兩峯·李復堂·金農·華新羅等。（羅·李·金·等雖非揚人。然在揚頗久。）均在揚行道成名。因當時鹽商豪富。有聲色狗馬姬妾之好。故風雅士多願寄跡留連也。光緒中葉。有王素·陳崇光·二名畫家。王宗新羅。陳宗老蓮。陳晚年狂蕩太甚。畫每不中規矩。聞其每晚回家。必痴立門前。以指在扉上塗畫不已。</p>
<p>舍間前居揚州北河下時。有李姓老嫗。年屆古稀。伶仃一人。其頂髮已牛山濯濯尙挽一銀元大之小鬏。每日必揷鮮花數朶。面塗粉似曹操。男女傭工。摒棄不用。僅雇用十二三齡小男孩。謂爲眞童男子且不食壯男所擔之水。每日係由男童向河下擔水煑飲。最怪者。祗留前半擔水飲。而後半擔水不用不飲。謂恐有屁味。嫌骯髒不潔也。</p>
<h3>周身龍形之老柚樹</h3>
<p>— 風舞</p>
<p>瓊崖僻處粤之西南。即合浦之斜對島嶼。宋帝炳因受元兵之迫。遁至瓊崖。陸秀夫負之跳海死。至今垂四五百年矣。瓊崖對面之海岸。即跳海處。旁有一柚樹。（即文旦樹）主幹有大龍形纒繞。大枝小枝均如是。人以爲樹皮之紋如此。但剥去其皮。枝内依然現出小龍形之明顯斑紋。殊爲不解。相傳宋帝赴海死時。解王袍掛此樹上。豈此柚樹受天地之正氣。而留人間後世之欽仰乎。當余客居該地時。曾親見之。出十五元之代價。向樹主購得小柚枝一根。製成烟桿。小龍活現。極爲玲瓏。惜携至香港。竟爲偷兒竊去。至今思之。猶有餘恨。讀者或疑吾言乎。則該樹依然鬯茂。結實之大。異於尋常之柚。或探詢瓊崖人士。當知吾言之不虚也。據該地人士云。該樹所結之實。爽口而芬芳。每雙價值三四元不等。惜時值暮春。未能一嘗。亦可惜也。</p>
<h3>唱片新談</h3>
<p>— 祝融氏</p>
<p>邇來唱片公司。風起雲湧。日漸繁盛。各各出奇制勝。爭羅名角。收集佳音。以冀執唱片界之牛耳。故新片發行。層出不窮。大中華唱片公司。本爲海上唱片公司中之佼佼者。近日。又有新收佳片。公之世人。而其中尤以芙蓉草之十三妹說親。得意緣訓女。及與楊寳森合唱之珠簾寨。爲最膾炙人口。芙蓉草早享盛名。海上人士。讚美者甚衆。近輔慧生。有相得益彰之妙。花衫中除梅程尙荀四大名旦之外。直推爲尊。口齒之清晰。做工之細膩。無與倫比。十三妹說親一節。即弓硯緣中張金鳳向十三妹說親事。爲大段之說白。戲劇中之說白。本較唱工爲尤難。芙能一氣呵成。一現乾竭之弊。聲音不高而亮。字眼清晰而正確。渾如走珠玉盤。一瀉而下。較之艶秋。無多讓也。得意緣訓女。乃唱白並重之作。小雲演此。即飾此角。不飾狄女。遂有反客爲主之稱。今芙飾此。若非慧生相配。亦彷彿小雲矣。起首唱詞。絕似慧生。其間說白。較說親越見乾脆。如并剪哀梨。聞之悠然神往。寳森以倒倉故。藏晦已久。現已恢復嗓音。太阿出匣。自然鋒利。與芙合唱坐帳一塲。鋒針相對。適足匹配。而芙之白口。工夫已深·於是收牡丹緑葉之助矣。</p>
<h3>我之企業談（下）</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>每年銷貨作二十萬論。内提廣告五厘。即得一萬。除經常廣告三千外。尙得七千元。可爲臨時特别廣告。並采薄利多賣主義。作二分毛利論。即得盈餘四萬。内以二萬元作開支。則純益爲二萬。即每百元核得廿元利息矣。如上觀之。足知以少數人之資力。集合萬元。而營一業。則失敗多而成功少。其利息須看三分。而開支僅祇三千。所有房租雜費以及職員薪食。（工食包括於貨物成本之内）豈二百五十元一月可能。即使可能。股息已歸無着矣。若爲公司。則如後述十倍算式。尙其小焉者。已得綽有餘裕。可操必勝之券。其勞逸相去遠甚。如果好勞惡逸。而願躬與其事。則章程可定駐廠董監資格。例如集資萬元以上者。在此十萬資本之小公司中。必被選舉無疑。蓋凡其人所招之股。其股東必舉其人。要無疑義。假定爲董事五人。監察三人。即除自己一人外。尙有七人合作爲助。比之跳獨角戲者。勞逸又去霄壤。而一切設施計畫。得有經騐者爲之領導。胥由集思廣益而來。當然勝於獨立無助者多多。故栩爲企業家設想。當先嚶鳴求友。而後擇其相當事業。合羣以赴。則其成功可必。否則輕嘗淺試。不如存放銀行。庶無失敗之虞。或謂銀行亦有倒閉險。而且利息甚微。予謂凡有餘力之人。以過剩之資財。存放銀行生息。固不如移作任何公司股東。以享較優之利。若防倒閉。則一例耳。蓋天下惟金錢最爲難放。即使藏之地窖。亦難保不爲地質中之硝磺氣所蛙蝕耳。（移酬助賑）</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>鄕下人又到上海（十三）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>他現在記起了他的外甥言語，他說下了火車以後，坐電車就可以到法租界。</p>
<p>出了鐡栅門，正有一輛電車，是從北火車站開到西門去的。他想我的外甥阿木林曾告訴我道；「從西門到梅蘭坊，却是不遠了。」他看許多人擠上電車，他也擠了上去。他想：我第一回到上海，坐了四等車。這一回到上海，坐了三等車。現在我坐電車，至少又要升一級。坐一個二等車。人是總要望高處爬的。先坐坐電車的二等車，回去的時候，拼着多花幾個錢，再坐一次火車的二等車，那不是我從三等脚色，便升到了二等脚色了嗎？　　他剛坐上電車，賣票的便走過來了。</p>
<p>「這裏是頭等。」賣票人看見了一個鄕下人，以爲他是走差了車子，便警告了他一下。</p>
<p>「阿呀！那末我要到二等車裏，請你給我開開門。」鄕下人急忙站起來，要賣票人導引到二等車裏去。</p>
<p>賣票人向他望了一望也，不答復他，想這個人眞是一個猪頭三了。</p>
<p>「不要嚕囌，把銅板摸出來。那裏去的？買票子吧。」</p>
<p>「咦！敎你領我到二等車裏去呀。我要坐二等的電車。」</p>
<p>幸虧傍邊有一個乘客，知道這個士我兒是新來上海，便告訴他道：「電車上只有頭等和三等，並没有二等的。」</p>
<p>「這又奇了。火車上是頭等，二等，三等，四等。各種等級，分得清清楚楚。怎麽電車上又只有頭等和三等，挖去了二等，這是什麽緣故呢？」</p>
<p>「那是連我也不懂。總之電車上是只有頭等和三等，没有二等的。你要坐頭等，就坐在此地。你要坐三等，便坐到隔壁去，車子快要開了。」</p>
<p>鄕下人從玻璃窗裏。望望隔壁三等車裏，却是很擠。有好幾位乘客，没有坐地，拉了一根皮條，好像把身體懸掛起來似的。他想還是多出幾個錢，坐了頭等車吧。究竟也做了一次頭等人，也可以回到鄕下，誇耀給他們没有來過上海的人聽聽。</p>
<p>可是他始終懷疑者；爲什麽上海的電車，有了頭等三等，却没有二等？</p>

<h3>紗花紗市徘徊之態</h3>

<h3>棉市稍見反動</h3>
<p>棉市微有反動、美棉估計生産雖增五十餘萬包、價格反漲、因此買方心思安定、又行加碼購進、市盤遂漲、然金價狂跌、銀價猛長、申新永安兩廠連日購進大量印美棉、約計有數萬件、今則興亨花可紡二十支紗之原料、祇合二十九兩五錢、照此情形、本棉前途、大受打擊、不過目前倉庫中現貨缺乏、所以多頭軋空心思未絕、反動易起云、</p>

<h3>糧食河下米驟漲半元</h3>
<p>▲南頭昨日各帮到船十數號、城鄕店銷因天時陰晦、人心穏固、又聞閘北先提、是以胃納尤覺活潑、成交較昨更漲、厚新粳行情驟漲半元、薄稻到貨寥寥、寗胃略有、市價亦增三四角、洋杜尖到銷二稀、亦跟硬二角、陰元到積不厚、酒户均皆辦動、致價復緊角許、</p>
<p>▲新閘昨以天時不佳、店號二方、乘此檔口購進存貨、歷年以來、立冬節後、米價必漲、西新早晚稻等貨、售盤均增近角、埠杜尖銷場極殷、硬起五分、變陰元隨到隨銷、行情提高殺次、内地到貨、因野鷄墩一帶被風未能馳進、故到頭寥寥、陳破洋尖胃呆、故趨勢穏定之象、</p>
<h3>標粉猛力下瀉</h3>
<p>▲津銷全停……金價飛降</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、又見巨大之跌風、以天津又受日人之暴動、已無市面、津帮之期現貨、或則停裝、或則回出、更以金市之接續暴落、又較前日落二三十兩、受此兩種之衝動、人心之不穏、彷彿已無法維持、故開價後、近遠期又暴落二三分不等、本月份至十二月、又一度亦進關、如四月份亦破一錢關口、跌勢之嚴重、不難想見、迨至下午開盤、以全市跌而復穏、且以投機多頭、又有吸進、近遠期遂回振一二分、觀察後步、如北方之實銷全停、暫無着高之機會也、結果本月份較前日跌下二厘半、十二月份小七厘半、一月份至四月份各小五厘云、</p>
<h3>期麥紛紛下落</h3>
<p>▲後市補空稍回</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、因金價重見暴落、洋麥之報價、又見微弱、且以國家之多難、天津又受日方之暴動、遂致人心皇皇、毫無把握、故開價後、即紛紛暴落、本月份低至七錢三分、十二月份至七錢八分、一月份至八錢四分、二月份至九錢三分、較前日收盤、又暴落六七分至一錢外不等、迨至下午開盤、以金市之回漲、復因空頭之急捕、市面又見反振、較最低時、亦好起六七分之巨、在時局多故之際、時升時沉、彷彿爲商業中之常態也、結果本月份較前日跌二分、十二月份跌二分、一二月份跌四分、三月份跌一分、四月份跌二分云、</p>
<h3>絲茶無錫絲廠陸續停業</h3>
<p>白廠經歐銷一蹶不振、紐約又因日絲廉價競銷、廠經開價益小、各廠商虧蝕益巨、無力支持、紛紛减工停機、昨據無錫絲商朱君述稱、邇來廠絲歐銷之疲滯、達於極點、幾至無人過問、存絲日厚、絲廠業無法維持、祇得暫行停業、以免破産、無錫新舊絲廠共計四十八家、現下停業者已達三十家、其餘十家亦均勉强開工、若歐美絲銷仍無轉機、則開工之各廠、勢必被逼、繼續停工云、</p>
<h3>歐美絲銷閒散</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、益趨閒散、緣紐約市塲、囤户存絲競相出售、價益趨疲、英法等處絲電均無轉滬、華絲商意興索然、昨祇新時昌等進白乾經二十包、達昌進嘉興緑絲十包、美大進黄粗絲五包、價仍平疲云、</p>
<h3>茶市一蹶不振</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、依然沉靜、婺源屯溪等路之鞏固緑茶、莫法行家、仍持觀望態度、完全無人問及、益以圖來先令放長、扯價過高、而日茶廉價競銷、華茶銷路大减、市面因之一蹶不振、昨日全市僅祇杜德昌隆等行、買進針眉秀眉緑茶共計八十餘箱、其餘均無交易云、</p>
<h3>閘北貨碼生晒圓肉高昂</h3>
<p>石碼桂圓、今庚出産甚歉、故生晒圓肉更屬稀少、查各號尙乏到過、兹據地頭函訊、每砠價已升至百二十元、加上一切外費、劃申成本、幾及百兩、此間各帮頗有需要、現正函達地頭催裝大約下週可有運到云、</p>
<h3>五金平白鐡昨到三四千擔</h3>
<p>薄貨平白鐡軋缺多日、致一般採辦均有無貨可購之概、昨棋昌棧新到現貨有三四千擔之多、查係北蘇州路一帶鐡行定貨、故將來交易前途、定必十分熱閙、行情每擔聞開十八兩五錢、查開出已有三五百担、購進者統保漢口一帶定户、而閩浙路之客帮、亦均有批出云、</p>

<h3>夏令配亞車展</h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>轟傳一時的倫敦夏令配亞汽車展覽會。業已於十一月五日正式開幕。在開幕之一小時前。遠近人士。至倫敦參觀的已是人山人海。擁軋得路不通行了。因爲這次的來賓。比上幾次展覽。分外的來得熱閙。開幕以後。參觀的人們。爭先奪後。陸續擁進了會塲。直到傍晚。參觀的還不少退减。而且這些來賓。大都是來自英國。會塲之中。陳列的車輛。雖是除了英國以外。各國的廠家也各有出品。但一般的觀衆。目光却十九集中於英國的出品上。從這種地方。我們也不難看出英國人的愛國思想了。在會塲的裏面。我們如果把各國的車輛比較一下。那麽英國的汽車。佔到優勢的地方。就在車價的低廉。外被的藝術化。物質的優良。車身的漂亮等等。</p>
<p>一般參觀的人對於奥斯汀。馬律師。多寳塔。華克斯好爾。新求。漢伯。標準牌。利蘭。希爾門。和其他各英國車廠的出品。尤其是來得注意。當塲定貨的人。雖是不十分踴躍。但一般的車商。對於前途。却都抱樂觀。預料明年的營業。一定有所發展。車輛的售價。在三百鎊以下的。格外引人注意。而八匹至十匹馬力的小車。尤其是銷路暢旺。今年英國各廠的新車。關於齒輪的變換方法。有不少改進的地方而且經過幾度的試車以後。女性的駕駛。更見來得適合。至於消耗方面。也非常的經濟。來賓的中間。來自海外的。也非常之多。可以說大戰以後。開了一　從來未有的新紀録。而這種盛况。大戰以後。在英國也確是没有見過。這許多的海外來賓。看見了英國的車輛。工程上有特殊的進步。大家驚歎不止。至於塲内陳列的汽船。那没有去年來得多。所有各種新車。究有若何優點。待下次再爲讀者詳述吧。</p>

<h3>Japanese Military in Tianjin Still Adopting a Provocative Stance</h3>
<p>More Than 300 Tianjin Rioters Have Been Captured and Executed</p>
<p>Japanese Army Transfers the 9th Division from Korea to Nenjiang</p>
<p>Japanese Collaborate with White Russians to Disrupt Middle East Routes</p>
<p>U.S. Government Plans to Again Urge China and Japan to Cease Hostilities</p>
<h3>Order in Tianjin Gradually Returning</h3>
<p>Japanese Concession Automatically Locks Down, Telephone Bureau Employees Face Starvation</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, all the Tianjin rioters were repelled. Initially, there were widespread rumors that they would gather at Fort Baotai in the evening, but due to strict precautions everywhere, this did not happen. This morning, order has been restored in all concessions, and pedestrians can pass freely. However, the Japanese Concession has automatically locked down, erecting iron mesh and machine guns. Japanese soldiers are armed with live ammunition and fire upon Chinese people upon sight. Therefore, in areas adjacent to the Japanese Concession, pedestrians have disappeared. In other Chinese areas, Henan is defended by police security teams, and Hebei is defended by the military. Order is very good, and security is not a concern. Yesterday's Japanese shelling caused extensive damage. Two security team vehicles were destroyed, and one team leader and more than ten soldiers were killed. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since last night, the situation in Tianjin City has been calm, but gunfire is still inevitable. By dawn, everything was completely silent. Military and police sentry posts are deployed everywhere, but have not been completely withdrawn. Shops in various concessions have resumed business as usual. Military and police authorities are responsible for strict precautions against the Japanese area. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) From noon to 9 p.m. on the 10th, no gunfire or artillery was heard. The plainclothes teams have become exhausted and will be cleared out by the 11th. However, the Japanese army, enraged out of shame, is increasingly pressing our military preparations. The situation is tense, and conflict with us seems difficult to avoid. More than 300 employees of the No. 2 Telephone Bureau are without food. On the morning of the 10th, they notified the Japanese soldiers to stop shooting, and a large amount of food was sent in by car. However, transportation between the Chinese and Japanese areas is cut off, and workers and rickshaw pullers cannot work, leaving at least 200,000 people or more starving at home. The reporter inquired with the Public Security Bureau, who said they had no way to provide relief. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the evening of the 10th, Japanese soldiers ordered that plainclothes teams wishing to enter the concessions must surrender their weapons and ammunition. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Large Number of Rioters Executed</h3>
<p>More Than 300 Plainclothes Team Members Arrested, Wang Shuchang Offers Reward for Arrest of Riot Leaders</p>
<p>(Beiping) In Tianjin, over a hundred plainclothes team members were captured this time. Yesterday, they were executed by shooting and beheading at the Southeast Corner, Dongmen, and Jintang Bridge, and their heads were displayed to the public. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) From the night of the 8th to the evening of the 10th, more than 300 plainclothes team members were captured, with more than 40 beheaded and shot, and 50 to 60 killed in action. More than 20 security team soldiers were wounded or killed, with one squadron leader wounded and one killed. Wang Shuchang rewarded 3,000 yuan on the evening of the 9th, and on the morning of the 10th, offered a reward for the capture of the riot leader, Li Jichun. A reward of 3,000 yuan was offered for his live capture, and 1,500 yuan for killing him. Businesses and residents throughout the Chinese city of Tianjin and the Japanese Concession remained closed on the 10th, and there were no pedestrians on the streets. Security was strict, and the sense of terror had not diminished. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the night of the 9th, members of the plainclothes teams cut off electricity in both the Chinese and Japanese areas, preventing a general attack. At dawn on the 10th, the Japanese army fired more than ten blank shots. Because District 2, Precinct 6, is close to the Japanese military camp in Haiguang Temple, our security team could not attack, so it is still occupied by plainclothes teams. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 6:50 a.m. on the 10th, more than ten plainclothes team members were discovered in the Nanqiangzi River and were routed. At 8:00 a.m., 400 to 500 plainclothes team members were discovered in Paotaizhuang and Wandezhuang. As of the evening, they were still surrounded. At 8:30 a.m., eleven plainclothes team members were captured, and eighteen guns were seized. At 9:00 a.m., a heavy truck was intercepted in the Qiangzi River, containing twenty guns. At 9:10 a.m., twenty-four plainclothes team members were captured in District 1, Precinct 6, along with seven guns and one flag. At 9:30 a.m., Japanese military police abducted three of our policemen, and their fate is unknown. At 11:00 a.m., the Japanese army used railroad ties to construct a platform at the Haiguang Temple military camp and installed heavy artillery, pointing in the direction of the provincial and municipal governments. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In addition to the fifteen rioters who had already been escorted to Beiping in two separate groups, military police in Tianjin City captured forty-seven more rioters yesterday and escorted them to Beiping on Zhang Fengge's special train. All were sent to the Garrison Headquarters for punishment. The prisoners looked haggard and were all lower-class figures from Tianjin City, many with opium and heroin addictions. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is said that about 400 rioters who caused trouble here on Sunday night were captured. It is rumored that many have been executed, but the exact number is unknown. However, it is widely believed that at least 50 have been shot. The terror of Sunday night has not recurred, but intermittent gunfire and occasional mortar fire were still heard last night and this morning. It seems that they all originated from within Chinese territory, but the truth is unknown. It is thought that the soldiers and police are engaging with fleeing rioters. Today, no civilians were seen on the streets of the Japanese Concession. Whether residents were ordered to stay home or were afraid to go out is unclear. Japanese soldiers and vigilantes patrol the streets all day long, and defenses along the border connecting to Chinese territory have been strengthened. Although the atmosphere is still tense, the panic within Chinese territory has decreased. Civilians are already moving about in the streets. It seems that Chinese authorities are confident that they can control the riots. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Municipal Government Notifies Consuls of Various Countries</h3>

Japanese Consul Gotō notified the consuls of England, Italy, the United States, Germany, and Belgium by telephone, saying, "Please listen to this artillery fire. Is it not the Chinese soldiers firing artillery? Please pay attention and do not falsely accuse the Japanese soldiers of firing artillery again." The consuls immediately telegraphed the provincial and municipal authorities to inquire about the truth. Wang Shuchang immediately sent troops to reply that there was no artillery within fifty li of Tianjin. If the military officers of friendly nations were interested in this artillery fire, they would be guided to inspect whether there were cannons within fifty li. Later investigation revealed that French troops were conducting military exercises with landmines and bombs in Dongjuzi. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This morning, the rumbling sound shook our eardrums. Initially, it was suspected to be the sound of mortars being fired, and people generally thought that the war had resumed. Later, it was learned that the French Concession's military depot was destroying stored, useless explosives, and people's hearts were put at ease. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shells Fired by Japanese Army</h3>
<p>(Beiping) More than forty shells discovered in Tianjin City yesterday, the Japanese side claimed, were blank shells fired to prevent rioters from invading the Japanese Concession. However, the backyard of Tonghecheng at No. 12 Yanghuo Street, District 1, Precinct 4 in the Chinese area, was destroyed by a shell. Its target was the Public Security Bureau. Shrapnel and other debris from the explosion have been collected, and military experts from various countries have been invited to examine them. It is said that the shrapnel was definitely not from a mortar, but from a type of shrapnel shell fired from a cannon. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Headquarters in Lushun Sends Fleet to Tianjin</h3>

<h3>U.S. Government Still Hopes for Direct Negotiations Between China and Japan</h3>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. government still hopes to discuss direct negotiations between China and Japan to resolve the Manchurian dispute. Reuters has learned that the U.S. government is now planning to again urge China and Japan to cease hostilities and withdraw their troops from dangerous areas. It will also reaffirm the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which opposes war as an instrument of national policy, and the articles of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing China's integrity. It is said that Secretary of State Stimson discussed the Manchurian situation with President Hoover today, and this decision to advise again was made. President Hoover was once the chief engineer of a Chinese mining bureau, so he is familiar with the situation in Manchuria. During the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Hoover and his wife were trapped in Tianjin. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>International Police to Maintain Security in Liaoning and Jilin</h3>
<p>A Proposal from the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, there is a proposal within the League of Nations to organize an international police force to maintain security in Liaoning and Jilin, so that the Japanese army can withdraw to the South Manchurian Railway (SMR) zone. The League of Nations believes that sending troops from other countries to the center of the Far East dispute is also a possible solution. This international police force, also known as the League of Nations police, could be jointly dispatched by countries striving for peace in the Far East or organized from foreign troops currently stationed in China. Its main task would be to protect the South Manchurian Railway and protect the lives and property of Japanese residents. However, this requires the consent of Japan, which is currently not expected to agree. As for China, it is very likely to agree. In that case, the international police would not need to be used to protect the South Manchurian Railway, but would be used solely to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents within Chinese territory, so that the Japanese army could completely withdraw to the SMR zone. According to the proposers, if China agrees, Japan will not be able to oppose the dispatch of international police to Chinese territory, as long as they do not enter the SMR zone. If so, Japan will no longer have an excuse to occupy Chinese territory. (10th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan's Reply to U.S. Note</h3>

<p>On the evening of the 8th, a major incident suddenly occurred in Tianjin City where rioters attacked the municipal government and the Public Security Bureau. The reason this major incident occurred is because a wave of dark terror is actively advancing westward from the northeast. Although the situation is slightly different from the Mukden Incident that broke out on the evening of September 18, its nature is exactly the same.</p>
<p>According to the explanation in the Kyodo News Agency's Tokyo dispatch on the 9th, "Today, the rioters claimed to be the Autonomous National Salvation Corps, numbering in the thousands. For a time, the situation was favorable, and they occupied Chinese agencies. However, their weapons were inferior, so they were suppressed by the military. Now, there is almost no hope of recovery." At the same time, based on the statement from the Japanese military command in Tianjin that "This riot is a disturbance in China's internal affairs. The Japanese army does not wish to interfere," and the report from Japanese Army Minister Minami at the extraordinary cabinet meeting on the 9th that "The Tianjin Incident is a domestic struggle within China," it would seem as if this Tianjin riot was indeed only due to the instigation of domestic turmoil within China and had no connection whatsoever with the Japanese. However, the facts on the other hand clearly show: (1) Before the riot occurred, the Japanese army demanded that our police station be vacated. (2) The rioters set out from the Japanese Concession and fired Mauser rifles near the Japanese military headquarters. (3) After the riot, the Japanese army demanded that our military police withdraw 300 meters from the Japanese Concession. (4) The Japanese army fired live ammunition at the Chinese area. Based on the explanation of these various facts, the ringleader who instigated this sudden riot should be clear to people all over the world. Facts speak louder than words. The world has already obtained a factual answer to this incident. The Japanese military and political circles are quibbling and trying hard to exonerate themselves, only revealing their inadequacy and embarrassment. "Trying to cover up only exposes it further."</p>
<p>The League of Nations' resolution on November 16 that the Japanese army must completely withdraw has been heard and seen by the world. The 16th is now approaching. The Japanese not only stated that they would definitely not withdraw their troops at that time but also continued to escalate their atrocities. In the northeast, they attacked our Heilongjiang Province and engaged in fierce battles with Ma Zhanshan's troops, causing the northeast situation to suddenly become tense again. In the interior, there was the sudden outbreak of the Tianjin Incident, and it is rumored that there are still plots to actively disrupt our other important cities, causing disturbances everywhere in our interior to confirm their propaganda that "China's political situation is extremely chaotic and unable to protect foreign residents." All these atrocities, on the one hand, prove that Japanese imperialists are determined to undermine world peace, and on the other hand, they prove that they do not care about the League of Nations' righteous advice at all and are even willing to inflict extremely severe blows on the League of Nations' prestige. The Chinese people, who love the League of Nations and world peace, cannot contain their internal anger at these ever-escalating atrocities, and at the same time, they cannot contain their pessimism and regret that the League of Nations' prestige has been buried by the Japanese.</p>
<p>After understanding the root cause of the outbreak of this Tianjin Incident, we dare to put forward the following two suggestions: First, the League of Nations should convene a meeting immediately in advance and should have the determination to restrain the atrocities of the Japanese army with a kind of indispensable coercive force and to maintain the prestige of the League of Nations and world peace.</p>
<p>Second, the people of our country should each have the spirit of Brigade Commander Ma Zhanshan to resist violence and defend the country, and be prepared at any time and anywhere to fight a deadly battle with the evil demons who uphold justice and disrupt the world.</p>
<p>Japanese economist and famous commentator Kamekichi Takahashi once said, "I think Japan's assertive policy towards China is just like a drowning person trying to grab a straw. It only shows that the Japanese imperialists are gradually becoming disappointed and anxious. Although the advocates of the assertive policy have wavered, they are still posing on the surface, but their helplessness is already clearly visible." The current situation of Japanese imperialism and its continuous atrocities prove that Takahashi's views are correct. We only need to have the determination to sacrifice for justice, and the powerful will eventually lie dead at the foot of justice. There is no need to worry or fear about the Tianjin disaster that was expected.</p>

<h3>Heilongjiang Province Defense Corps Begins Military Training</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The Heilongjiang Province Defense Corps has begun military training, with a total of 80,000 people in the province. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Incites White Russians to Disrupt Middle East Route</h3>
<p>Intended to Challenge Soviet Russia</p>
<p>(Moscow) A report from Khabarovsk states that Japanese military personnel in Manchuria are currently making every effort to incite White Russians to disrupt the Middle East Railway. Newspapers here are paying close attention to the report. On the 4th of this month, the Soviet authorities in Khabarovsk received reliable information that White Russian leader General Gus, under the instigation of the Japanese, is engaged in a conspiracy to disrupt the Chinese Eastern Railway. Those involved in this collusion are a high-ranking Japanese military official stationed in Harbin named Osawa and a reporter from a Russian-language newspaper (Harmlmnskoye Vremya) published by the Japanese in Harbin. According to the terms agreed upon by the Japanese and Gus, Gus should attack the Soviet Consulate in Harbin, the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau, the Chinese Eastern Railway machinery department, the Far Eastern Bank, and Soviet institutions in Harbin. At the same time, all Soviet officials, from the Consul General downwards, should be arrested. The aim is to create an excuse for a Japanese-Russian war. The report also states that all weapons and money needed by the White Russians will be supplied by the Japanese side as much as possible. (National News Agency telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Jilin Puppet Finance Department Exempts Manchukuo Railway Timber Tax</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The Jilin puppet Finance Department is trying to ingratiate itself with Japan by exempting the timber tax for Japanese and Manchukuo railways. This tax is a major source of revenue for Jilin. (Special telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Jihai Railway Revenue Plummets</h3>
<p>(Harbin) After the Jihai Railway was connected to the Jichang Railway, revenue has sharply declined, now only bringing in 1,000 yuan per day. The Japanese military police garrison headquarters has moved to the Provincial Party Headquarters. (Special telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Telegraphs Situation of Resisting Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Longjiang Ma Zhanshan's telegram states: "Japan's plot for northern Manchuria and its ambition have been exposed and are visible to the world, there is no need for concealment. This time, under the pretext of repairing the Jiangqiao Bridge, they launched a large-scale attack. Our troops are trying to defend themselves and can only engage with them. In continuous fierce battles, attacking in the mornings and raiding at night, they are wantonly slaughtering, causing numerous casualties on our side. Finally, under excessive pressure, we retreated to defend the Sanjianfang, Daxiao Xinzhuang area, building fortresses for defense. However, Japanese weapons are sophisticated and superior to ours by a hundredfold. Knowing that communication with Jiang Province is cut off and calls for help are unanswered, with only the military strength of one corner, how can we resist the large army of one country, Japan? What is somewhat self-reliant is that all our front-line soldiers deeply understand righteousness, are filled with righteous indignation, have the spirit to swallow rivers and mountains, and share the same hatred against the enemy. In addition, Zhanshan has received deep trust from the country and the heavy expectations of the people. Witnessing the fall of Liaoning and Jilin and Jiang Province as precarious as stacked eggs, rather than losing our territory and abandoning our elders and fathers, it is better to sacrifice everything and fight to the end. If blessed by heaven, perhaps we can maintain it for a time and obtain a final stroke of luck. Today, Japanese troops repeatedly sent airplanes to continuously drop bombs on us, while mobilizing troops and gradually advancing. Observing the situation, I fear that in the shortest time, they will launch a full-scale attack. Zhanshan is responsible for defending the territory and will never allow an inch of land to fall into the hands of foreigners as long as there is breath. I can only adhere to my original intention, swear to engage with them, persist to the end, and never yield. I hope that all those with insight in the country will understand this. In addition to vowing to lead the front-line soldiers to fight to the death, and sending the recent situation via telegram to the League of Nations to request measures for restraint, and waiting for the just resolution of various countries in the world, I earnestly request that the elders and fathers of the country strive to invigorate themselves to save the country from danger. I am filled with extreme indignation. Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang Province Ma Zhanshan bows and declares." (Special telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan telegraphed Zhang Xueliang and Wan Fulin on the 9th, saying that before the 6th, the Japanese army had about 4,000 infantry and cavalry, more than 40 artillery pieces of various types, seven or eight airplanes, mostly assembled from Jilin and Changchun, two or three armored trains, and about 200 trains of military supplies such as wireless stations, hospitals, and bridge-building materials, arriving in Tailai. Zhang HaiPeng's army has jointly gathered bandits, about six or seven thousand, and is still recruiting. The timing of the army's continued attack is currently unclear. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Authorities Had Early Warning of Disturbance</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) There is now evidence that the Chinese authorities had warning before this disturbance. On Sunday, a train of Chinese soldiers arrived here from a camp beside the Beining Railway, sixteen miles east of Tianjin, ordered to guard key points at a distance from the Japanese concession to prevent firing on the Japanese concession in case of a riot. Public opinion is that these reinforcements arrived in time and saved Tianjin that night. Another piece of evidence is that Zhang Xueliang's brother, Xueceng, was originally scheduled to hold a wedding ceremony in the Japanese concession on Sunday evening, and it was expected that dignitaries from all over the city would attend. Invitations had already been sent out, but suddenly on Saturday, the invited guests were notified that the banquet would be moved to the French concession. The temporary change of venue must have had a reason. The Chinese and Japanese concessions are both very quiet at the moment, but both have strict curfews, prohibiting residents from going out at night. (Reuters telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul Tries to Cover Up</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese consul told a reporter from the North China Star that he did not hear the sound of Japanese soldiers firing guns or cannons. He knows that the Japanese soldiers' guns and shells are not even enough for their own use, how could they randomly fire them? The reporter smiled and dismissed it. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Doihara Participates in Treasonous Plot in Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) It has now been determined that the disturbance of public order by rioters this time was a planned step by the Japanese side. Doihara came to Tianjin not only to persuade Puyi to go to Liaoning to form an independent country, but also to participate in the treasonous plot to disrupt Tianjin, using disgruntled Chinese military personnel to seize political power in Tianjin, creating a situation similar to Liaoning and Jilin. Zhang Bi and others, blinded by greed, do not hesitate to act as accomplices for the Japanese. However, the scheme was leaked and the cunning plan failed. The Japanese authorities, with the black curtain exposed and ridiculed by various countries, turned shame into anger, finding themselves in a paradoxical situation. In addition to ordering retired soldiers to actively prepare for military action, they have also disarmed the plainclothes teams within the concession since the evening of the 9th. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Yao and Yu's Brigades Arrive Near Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yao Dongfan and Yu Zhaolin's brigades arrived near Tianjin this morning, ordering the security team and police to go ahead, with the troops behind, to jointly suppress Tianjin and maintain order. The Second Team of Northeast Armored Trains, led by Team Leader Zhao Liangbi, arrived in Tianjin yesterday with more than 300 soldiers, stationed at the New Railway Station for defense. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu's Expression Regarding the Tianjin Incident</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Han Fuqu telegraphed Jin Wenxi, the head of his Ping Office, saying, "I have read the telegram of the 9th regarding the incident in Tianjin. Today, when the country is in urgent distress, anyone with blood and spirit should be deeply concerned and invigorated to face the national crisis and save the critical situation. Those people are only afraid that the country will not be in chaos, buying off rioters, letting wolves into the house, and willingly being traitors, which is extremely distressing." (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Vice Zhang's representative, Fan Pujiang, arrived in Jinan from Ping this afternoon. Li Shuying, Zhang Yue, Li Zongbi, and Peng Shibin, Vice Zhang's representative in Jinan, all welcomed him at the station. Fan said that Vice Zhang went to Beijing earlier for Northeast diplomacy, consulted with the President, and because it was related to public order in North China, it was necessary to report to Chairman Han and report on the current situation in the Northeast and the Japanese military hiring rascals to disrupt Tianjin, so he sent me to Jinan to report. I will return north in three to five days. In the afternoon, Fan met Han and reported, and Han hosted a banquet for Fan. Fan said that the Tianjin incident has subsided, and the Japanese army fired fourteen cannons, but they do not admit it. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Han Fuqu's wife came to Ping yesterday because her daughter is scheduled to marry in Ping on the 12th, so she came to make preparations. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Special Foreign Affairs Committee Meets</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Special Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 5:00 PM on the 10th. All committee members in Nanjing attended and discussed matters related to Sino-Japanese diplomacy. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan to Reopen on the 16th, United States Invited to Attend</h3>
<p>U.S. Government Planning New Move</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat today sent a document to Washington, formally inviting the United States to attend the upcoming Council meetings to mediate the Liaoning-Jilin incident. The Secretariat and the French Foreign Ministry also formally announced that the Council will meet in Paris on the 16th. (National News Agency telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, as usual, met with reporters. Although he refused to discuss the Liaoning-Jilin incident, according to sources within the State Department, the U.S. government is currently planning a new move, hoping to prevent further warfare between Chinese and Japanese troops. The nature of the plan is not convenient to disclose at this time. Regarding the League of Nations' invitation to the United States to attend the Council meetings, it is expected here that the U.S. government will accept the invitation. However, how the reply will be worded, the official department has not yet indicated. (National News Agency telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Some members of the League of Nations oppose holding the Executive Council meeting in Paris, reportedly because there are many foreign students in Paris, fearing their disruptive influence on the Council's discussions. However, the League of Nations Executive Council will not change its plans because of this. Today, it has issued a convening notice for a meeting to be held in Paris on November 16th. League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond today released the original text of the Chinese government's reply to Briand's telegram of November 6th, urging him not to aggravate the situation. The reply urgently hopes that governments of all countries will send representatives to inspect the truth and obtain evidence of Japan's sinister destruction of the Executive Council's proposal. Japan's reply was also released simultaneously, narrating the situation of the war near the Nenjiang Railway Bridge, and stating that the Japanese army is now striving to avoid contact with Chinese soldiers. If Chinese soldiers no longer engage in acts of war, there is no reason to worry about the escalation of the situation. Dr. Shih Chao-chi today sent a letter to the League of Nations Secretariat, enclosing a report from Wan Folan of the Salt Inspectorate. The letter requested that the League of Nations, the United States, and world opinion use any methods required by the situation to maintain the dignity of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. The report contained a telegram from Changchun on November 6th, stating that Japanese military authorities forcibly withdrew salt funds from the Chinese Bank and the Bank of Communications, and stated that not only is the Japanese denial of forcibly seizing the Niuzhuang salt tax purely false, but the Japanese military authorities are now still using their directly created agencies, completely controlled by Japanese military force, to forcibly intercept salt taxes from other places. In his letter, Dr. Shih detailed the Japanese army's interception of salt taxes in Niuzhuang and Changchun, and stated that there is sufficient evidence that the Japanese army is intercepting salt taxes. The Japanese army has consistently adopted a policy of expanding its occupation and overthrowing the authority of the Chinese government. This kind of behavior has nothing to do with the safety of Japanese people and their industries in Manchuria. The situation is now completely clear. China earnestly hopes that the League of Nations will have something to sanction it. (Reuters telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to external information, the League of Nations issued a notice to Russia six days ago, hoping to send three members to attend the League of Nations. As of now, there has been no reply from Russia. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>The newly appointed British Foreign Secretary, Sir John Simon, has decided to accompany Viscount Cecil to Paris to attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting convened on November 16th. (Reuters telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Forcibly Withdraws Salt Tax</h3>
<p>Total Amount Exceeds Three Million Yuan, Shih Chao-chi Calls Attention of All Countries</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese Chief Representative Shih today notified the Council that Japanese military authorities have ordered their established agencies to forcibly withdraw 2.6 million yuan in salt taxes stored in the Chinese Bank and the Bank of Communications in Changchun, transferring it to the Official Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces. This shows that Japanese military officers continue to forcibly seize salt taxes through agencies organized and directed by them. To date, the total amount seized exceeds 3 million yuan. China has now presented full evidence to the League of Nations Council, the United States, and world opinion, proving that the Japanese army is following its long-established policy of expanding its occupied areas, undermining Chinese administrative authority, and replacing it with its puppet agencies, forcibly intercepting Chinese taxes. Now that the situation is completely clear, China firmly believes that members of the League of Nations, the United States, and world opinion will use any methods required by the situation to maintain the League of Nations Charter, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Anti-War Pact. (National News Agency telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Deploying Troops Uncertain</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting on the 9th regarding the Japanese troops' encroachment on Heilongjiang Province under the pretext of repairing the Nenjiang Bridge. All committee members said that if Russia deploys troops to the Chinese Eastern Railway, it will be displeasing to the Chinese people. Because the Chinese people have already strongly resisted Japan's deployment of troops to the Three Eastern Provinces, how can the Soviet Union learn from Japan's aggressive steps and deploy troops to northern Manchuria? As a result, it was decided that unless Japan directly invades Soviet territory, the Soviet Union will not take military action. First, warn Japan to pay attention to the lives and property of Soviet people along the Eastern Railway. The government has received reports on the above situation. Today, widespread rumors of Russia deploying troops to Hailar are absolutely unfounded. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>

<h3>Opening of the New British Parliament</h3>
<p>The British Monarch Attends and Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 10th - At noon today, the British Monarch attended the opening ceremony of Parliament. The ceremony was as grand as in previous years. After the ceremony, the British Monarch stood up and read a speech. As expected, it focused on the financial panic. However, the opening section stated that the government intends to pursue a policy of peace and goodwill and will continue to be concerned about the work of the League of Nations, paying close attention to the preparations for the Disarmament Conference. The success of this effort will benefit the entire world. Next, it stated that the government is extremely concerned about the serious situation of world finance and economy, and intends to do everything possible, in conjunction with other governments, to seek methods to restore international trade in a spirit of mutual assistance. It then mentioned the Indian Round Table Conference and other matters. Next, it mentioned that the results of the general election proved that public opinion supports reducing government spending to balance the budget. This is the first important step in solving financial and economic problems. The government is now considering various important issues, and as soon as a decision is made, it will be implemented as soon as possible. However, any legislation that is deemed necessary will be submitted to Parliament as agreed.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister MacDonald's Speech on Two Major Problems</h3>
<p>Balancing the British Budget, Balancing British Trade</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 9th - British Prime Minister MacDonald said tonight at a banquet of the London City Council, asking the people to give the government time to mature its plans and ensure the implementation of its work, saying that the government has two major problems to solve: balancing the British budget and balancing British trade. The people should give their full support to Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain and Secretary of State for Trade Runciman, as these two are responsible for this important task. The British monetary system caused by the foreign situation can only be dealt with satisfactorily after the situation turns better. The British Prime Minister continued, saying that Germany's position must be completely reorganized. Germany must be a willing participant in this reorganization to establish an acceptable but feasible agreement and avoid causing further financial and commercial difficulties. What will happen when the German debt is due on February 29 next year? The new and old worlds bear the heavy responsibility of avoiding disaster. Next month, we may enter a dangerous and turbulent area. The British government is now coordinating the overall situation, but it depends on the approach and mutual compromise of the countries concerned, especially Germany and France, otherwise the world will get worse and worse, until it collapses and a revolution occurs. So far, all efforts to resolve the economic panic have been against tariffs, reparations, and war debts. He hopes that French Prime Minister Laval's visit to Washington will be followed by an understanding between France and Germany. The United Kingdom wants to stabilize the pound as soon as possible, but the timing depends on external causes. The main purpose at present is to effectively maintain the purchasing power of the pound. The current Disarmament Conference cannot be separated from the general situation of the world. The United Kingdom is willing to do its best to promote its success, but in terms of disarmament, all countries must proceed in a consistent manner. The British Prime Minister then mentioned the good signs of the recovery of British commerce, saying that in the past five weeks, the number of unemployed people in the United Kingdom has decreased by 114,000, and the two major industries of wool and cotton have made even greater progress. The British Prime Minister mentioned the Canadian Economic Conference, saying that the British government can accept the Canadian government's invitation to participate in the economic conference held in Ottawa, but it cannot be held before July next year. Therefore, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Thomas will travel to various autonomous regions in advance to personally investigate various possibilities. The British Prime Minister did not mention the Round Table Conference, saying that although the work of formulating a constitution is not easy, the British have deeply imprinted their aspirations and thoughts in the minds of the Indian people, hoping that the Indian people will trust the British, because this is the necessary foundation of any constitution.</p>

Some say that if this move can succeed, Smetona's self-establishment as king is also within expectations. However, government officials do not comment on this news, only saying that rumors cannot be trusted.</p>

<h3>Japanese Fallacies Regarding the Northeast Issue (2)</h3>
<p>▲Lacking Understanding of Manchuria, Arakawa, Representative from Andong</p>
<p>I find the unusually tough attitude of Osaka's businessmen not very appropriate. Now, after hearing the opinions of government officials, I am very satisfied, but I think there is still a shortcoming, that is, the general public lacks a correct understanding of Manchuria. The League of Nations and Foreign Minister Shidehara himself also have the same shortcoming. This is a reflection of the general public's lack of understanding. The people who live in Manchuria should be responsible for this, but I often wonder if the Japanese national character is not suitable for overseas travel. Moreover, the current call to abandon Manchuria and Mongolia, a certain senator in the United States once said, "If China does not cede territory to Japan, a war will occur." The late Wang Yongjiang, a subordinate of Zhang Zuolin, also said, "Japan, with its small territory, obtained Korea and desires Manchuria, which is natural. But if Japan is willing to slightly restrict its extraterritorial rights, the Chinese people will also welcome it very much." The importance of the relationship between Japan and Manchuria and Mongolia is due to its relation to the survival rights of the Japanese state. If we can understand this significance, the powers will not interfere too much with our actions in Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>▲League of Nations Lacks Understanding of Manchuria and Mongolia, Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs is Too Negligent, Dr. Suehiro</p>
<p>I opposed using force to resolve the Manchuria and Mongolia issue before the incident on September 18, because our intellectuals and young people still do not pay enough attention to Manchuria and Mongolia. They have not been able to fully understand issues such as the Manchurian Railway parallel line problem and the Jihui Line problem. Before mobilizing the people, they should be made to thoroughly understand these issues. At the Pacific Conference the year before last, the countries did not pay attention to the Manchuria and Mongolia issue. Although I thought that we must first make the countries understand this issue, but now that the force has been launched and the deed is done, we can only plan how to thoroughly resolve it favorably. Our government has two attitudes towards this issue: 1. Troops are still stationed in important locations outside the Manchurian Railway affiliated areas to guarantee negotiations. 2. Although troops are currently withdrawn to protect the rights and interests of Japanese citizens, conflicts will still occur in one or two years. At that time, if we obtain the understanding of the countries first before sending troops again, the countries can recognize it as a legitimate action. But no matter which point, I believe that this problem cannot be solved in a day or two. Therefore, before resolving this issue, we should first expand the propaganda about Manchuria to the public. On the other hand, after the countries understand the "Japan-Manchuria relationship," there will always be a country that can give our country sympathy and earnestly contact each other. The current Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not paid attention to this. Therefore, no country helped Japan with the issue of the United States attending the League of Nations Executive Council this time. The countries do not recognize that our country is in a special position with respect to Manchuria. This matter is the most troublesome. I believe that Germany and Italy have the possibility of becoming our country's friendly nations, because their situation is similar to Japan's current situation. I have held this view until now, but I have not been able to win the approval of anyone. Secondly, regarding the defense against Chinese exclusion of Japanese goods, if this boycott movement is automatically generated by the Chinese people, it will be quite difficult to deal with. But the fact is definitely not the case. I believe that the anti-Japanese society's strategy is backed by the government. So perhaps the abolition of consular jurisdiction and other things will still happen in the future. If Japan firmly opposes this issue, the countries will inevitably agree, creating an opportunity to punish and alert the Chinese authorities. This is the way to defend against the Chinese boycott movement.</p>
<p>▲It is Best to Seek a Friendly Nation in the League of Nations, Mr. Inabata</p>
<p>I think forgetting propaganda is definitely a mistake. We now understand that the League of Nations does not understand the Japan-Manchuria relationship at all. Propaganda is one of the national defense strategies, but things have become a deadlock. We have to believe that the tough measures were used too early. Although there are now plans to help Manchuria become independent and earnestly cooperate with each other, I am very doubtful whether it can succeed. This plan will make the countries suspicious that "Japan is annexing Manchuria," and will inevitably put Japan in an isolated position. Judging from the process of the League of Nations Council, among the countries present, we may not be able to get one or two friendly nations. If we can, it will be extremely helpful in promoting the development of the situation.</p>
<p>▲The Losses Caused by the Boycott of Japanese Goods in Shanghai Have Reached 150 Million Yuan, Those Who are Suffering are Not Only Osaka, but the Whole of Japan is Damaged, Mr. Ogura</p>
<p>The last time I heard that the businessmen in Tokyo and Osaka advocated adhering to a tough attitude to the end, some people doubted this claim. This is because they do not have a proper understanding of the relationship between Osaka and China. Trade with China is of utmost importance to our country. Since the Manchurian Incident, the losses suffered in Shanghai have reached 150 million yuan. Osaka's pain is the pain of the whole of Japan. In order to uphold our country's greater rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia, the whole country should unanimously devise a satisfactory solution. Regarding the anti-Japanese aspect, I have two opinions: 1. No matter what happens to the trade between the two countries, no matter what means are used to boycott Japanese goods, there will always be some outlet, so there is no need to worry too much. 2. The nature of the Chinese people is that if they are forced too much, they themselves will suffer as a result. But in any case, the solution to this problem is ultimately a world problem. If we can obtain the understanding of the League of Nations and the United States, we will naturally get a satisfactory conclusion. Recently, the attitude of the United States has been quite sympathetic to me, so this problem may be solved satisfactorily in the future.</p>
<p>▲Unifying National Opinion is the Most Urgent Task, Mr. Zhongshan</p>
<p>Now, obtaining the understanding of the countries is not a big problem. Now that the Manchurian matter has become a fait accompli, we need to consider Japan's past, present, and future. Strengthening the national will to unify national opinion is the most urgent task at present. Contacting friendly nations is a subsequent issue. If the League of Nations has any points that make us regret, our country should unanimously and resolutely oppose it. At the Chamber of Commerce and Industry held in Osaka on May 4, there was an opinion that the coexistence and co-prosperity of the Chinese and Japanese people must rely on mutual spiritual understanding and economic cooperation between the two countries to succeed. Based on this position, there was a "proposal to establish a research committee on China issues." With the establishment of the research committee, and in order to uphold Japan's legitimate rights, a list of China issues was compiled for this incident. Witnessing the current anti-Japanese violence, we should abandon gentle means and fight back with aggressive means.</p>
<p>▲Today, the People's Eyes and Ears Should be Focused on the Manchuria and Mongolia Issues, Mr. Su Feng Also Said</p>
<p>I lectured on China issues in Okayama, Hiroshima, and Kobe the day before yesterday, and received unexpected success. For example, last night in Kobe, there were as many as 2,500 listeners. This is enough to prove the Japanese people's enthusiasm for this China issue. The Japanese people have a fire-like patriotic heart, are willing to risk their lives for justice, and are worthy of being very sensitive and receptive people. So please rest assured those who worry that the national opinion cannot be unified. This is my impression of this trip. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Openly Commit Aggression</h3>
<p>▲Using the Repair of the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Railway's Jiangqiao Bridge as a Pretext▲Continuous Attacks on Heilongjiang Troops Since the 4th</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Using the Jiangqiao Bridge on the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Railway as a pretext, Japanese troops suddenly launched a fierce attack on our garrison in Jiangqiao on the morning of the 4th. The Amano Brigade of the Korean Brigade stationed in Jilin, and the Hasegawa Brigade of the 2nd Division stationed in Changchun, each dispatched a part of their forces to rush to the Tao'an-Ang'angxi line for reinforcement on the night of the 4th. At present, the war is in full swing in that area. In order to consolidate the defense of the province, the Heilongjiang troops, in addition to a part of the 1st Cavalry Brigade, the Wu Songshan Regiment, stationed locally to resist the attack, also had the newly organized 1st Infantry Brigade (reorganized from Zou Zuohua's Tuntian Army) stationed at the Fularji Station of the East China Railway, and the 1st Regiment of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, the Zhang Zhanjiu Unit, which arrived at Ang'angxi Station by train at 8:00 this morning and transferred to Gargar (Jiangqiao) to assist in the defense. The war broke out at 5:00 am on the 4th, when 700 Japanese soldiers arrived at Jiangqiao from Tao'an on a column of armored trains. One of their officers crossed the river to our military camp, saying that more than 100 Japanese soldiers were protecting the workers of the South Manchuria Railway to repair the Jiangqiao Bridge, and that the Heilongjiang troops should retreat to 20 li outside the railway line to facilitate the work. Our regimental commander replied that he had not received orders from his superiors and could not accept it. The Japanese officer left without saying a word. In less than half an hour, the Japanese troops launched a fierce artillery attack on our troops. The armored trains fired cannons to threaten our troops, covering their workers, trying to lay a pontoon bridge and drive into our territory. The infantry was also preparing to charge. Seeing this, our troops resisted with all their might. After holding on until about 10:00 am, the Japanese troops were unable to sustain and retreated. At noon, the Japanese troops launched another large-scale attack. At the same time, three planes also came to help and drop bombs. Our troops suffered a lot of casualties from the bombing, but their morale was even more boosted. Without the slightest fear, they still risked their lives to resist. At about 3:00 pm, they repelled the Japanese troops again. Unable to succeed, the Japanese troops sent four more planes at about 4:00 pm, entered the rear of Jiangqiao Station, surrounded Daxing Station, the ticket office, the machine factory, the car factory, etc., and threw bombs violently, dropping more than 20 bombs, destroying the ticket office, the machine factory, etc., and injuring or killing more than ten railway workers. The planes did not leave until about 5:00 pm. At 10:00 pm on the evening of the 4th, the Japanese troops launched another full-scale attack, using the searchlights of the armored trains to find our military trenches and indicate the direction of the artillery fire, firing hundreds of shells. Our troops relied on the reeds on the riverbank to confront the enemy. In addition, 300 Japanese soldiers, as a separate detachment, crossed the river to the north in more than 100 ferries, trying to attack the rear of our troops. They were detected by our troops and repelled with machine guns, sinking more than ten ships and drowning more than 100 enemy soldiers. At 3:00 am on the morning of the 5th, the war eased slightly. At about 6:00 am, the Japanese troops launched a fourth attack, and five planes also came to drop bombs. As of the writing of this letter, the fighting is still going on. Ma Zhanshan, feeling that the Japanese troops' unwarranted oppression and bullying were too much, formed the General Command of the Heilongjiang Army yesterday, with the headquarters set up in the provincial capital. Ma himself serves as the commander-in-chief, and the deputy commander-in-chief is Xie Ke, the chief of staff of the Frontier Affairs Department. The general headquarters is divided into six departments: Adjutant (Tang Fengjia as director), Military Law (Jin Xijun as director), Military Supplies (Li Menggeng as director), Military Medicine (Cai Yamin as director), and Intelligence (Wang Jingxiu as director). It is heard that Ma has resolved to rather be shattered like jade than be a slave of a fallen country, and is determined to resist the Japanese troops to the end. The order in Heilongjiang is as usual. Because Ma issued an order that officials who abandon their posts and flee will be executed by firing squad, the personnel of various agencies are all working as usual, and the people's hearts are also very stable. It was found that on the evening of the 3rd, the Japanese army issued a statement, which was sent to Ma Zhanshan by the Kanto Army Commander Honjo, with unusually harsh words, which shows that they had the determination to provoke a war long ago. The original text is as follows: "Since the Heilongjiang Ma Zhanshan Army destroyed the Nenjiang Railway Bridge on the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Railway, it has been more than half a month and has not been repaired. Now that the new grain is on the market, the road is impassable, which has a great impact on the economic life of the Chinese and Japanese people and is also threatened in terms of transportation. Therefore, the repair of the railway bridge is urgent. The South Manchuria Railway and the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Railway Bureau will start repairing it on the 4th of this month under the cover of the Japanese army. The Japanese army, based on the attitude of strictly adhering to neutrality, protects the employees and repairs it, so as to prevent bad events from happening. Before the start of construction, it has notified Ma Zhanshan and Zhang Haipeng's armies to withdraw from the bridge by 10 kilometers, and will not be allowed to use this bridge for tactical use in the future."</p>
<p>After Zhang Haipeng's rebel army advanced to Tailai, it wanted to wait for the Japanese army to open the way for it and enter Heilongjiang in one fell swoop. Therefore, the Japanese army had to take the first line in the current war at Jiangqiao Station, knowing very well that Zhang's troops were useless. Zhang is currently in Tailai, calling himself the Security Supervisor of the Four Banners and Seven Counties on the Mongolian Border, setting up the Supervisor's Office in Tailai Town, confiscating the Heilongjiang Guangxin Company, forming the Zhang Supervisor's Bank, issuing banknotes, and ordering the counties to use them, so the finances are extremely chaotic, and the price of food has also risen as a result. Zhang extorted military expenses from Tao'an, Dongping, and other places, asking each to supply 10,000 yuan. The counties are all poor areas, how can they raise this amount? As a result, most of the tax officials and county magistrates fled, and no one was in charge of the local area. The bandits took the opportunity to rise up. Zhang was intent on attacking Heilongjiang, but instead fostered bandits to increase his own importance. The large bandit gangs were immediately recruited and given the positions of regiment or battalion commander. Since Zhang's last defeat, the remaining remnants were less than 2,000. Recently, he has incorporated bandits and organized them into five detachments and four infantry and cavalry regiments. Including the old troops, there are a total of eight regiments and five detachments, but the actual number of people in each regiment is only three or five hundred. West of Tailai is Zhang's sphere of influence. The troops are scattered as follows: in Tao'an City, the 3rd Regiment of Fu Mingxin's troops, and the newly organized 3rd Regiment of Fu Mingxin, a total of 700 people. The 4th Cavalry Detachment of Zhang's eldest son, Zhang Junzhe, 200 people, and the 5th Detachment of Zhang's fourth son, Zhang Zhiming (currently being recruited). The 13th Independent Regiment of Zhang's second son, Zhang Junqing, is at Jieji Station, about 500 people. The 9th Independent Regiment of Song Liansheng is at Xiawazi near Tailai City, about 300 people. The newly organized 6th Regiment of Li Zhen's troops, 300 people. The 3rd Cavalry Detachment of Liu Maoyi's troops, 500 people, is at Taipingchuan Station. The 1st Detachment of Xu Jinglong's troops, 500 people, is at Shuangchengzi Station. The 2nd Detachment of Peng Fei's troops, 500 people, and the newly organized 1st Regiment of Tang Jizhen's troops, 200 people, and the 2nd Regiment of Mi Kaiyuan's troops, 400 people, the total number of rebel troops is about 7,000, of which half are bandits, and about 1,000 are Mongolian bandits.

The 4th Air Squadron was ordered to return to the province, leaving only the 1st Squadron of Deng Yueming's troops stationed in Shaoguan City. The squadron had seven planes for reconnaissance purposes. The pilots and others had to practice flying every day at dawn. At about 7:00 am on the 3rd of this month, the 1st Squad Leader of the squadron, Qiu Lunwen, and the pilot, Xue Chunyi, rode together in the No. 1 training plane, speeding through the air to guide the other four planes in learning flying skills. After the matter was completed, the planes landed one after another. However, when Qiu and others' No. 1 plane was landing, the parts suddenly broke down. The pilot could not control it. The plane was bumpy in the air and crashed into the river outside the South Gate of Shaoguan City, hitting an obstacle. The fuselage was broken. Squad Leader Qiu Lunwen and Pilot Xue Chunyi were crushed to death on the spot. Part of their limbs were also blown away. The death was very tragic. Seeing this, the pilots immediately sent a boat to rescue them. When the boat arrived, the bodies of the two men had already floated to the surface. The No. 1 plane was damaged beyond repair. Therefore, the bodies of the two men were first transported back to the aircraft field outside the South Gate to wait for encoffining. At the same time, they tried to salvage the destroyed plane. When the squadron leader heard the news, he hurried to Shaoguan to buy coffins and give Qiu and Xue the first funeral. He immediately telegraphed back to the province and was allowed to transport the coffins back the next day. After receiving the news, the Aviation Headquarters prepared two special trains on the morning of the 4th and went to Shaoguan City to transport the two coffins back to Guangzhou. They arrived at about 5:00 pm that day. The aviation community had already arrived at the station in advance to welcome the coffins and planned to bury them in the air force cemetery outside the eastern suburbs during the day. Qiu was the 1st Squad Leader of the 1st Air Squadron. He was skilled in aviation and was a graduate of the first class of the Guangdong Aviation School. He was from Meixian and was 28 years old. Xue was from Fujian. After graduating from the Xiamen Aviation School, he came to the Guangdong Aviation Office to serve. He is currently a pilot in the 1st Squadron and is 25 years old.

<h3>Wuhu Levies Business Tax After Disaster</h3>
<p>▲Arrests Shop Managers on the 7th and 8th▲The Business Community is Angry and Fears a Strike</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: The Anhui Province business tax was originally a regular tax to make up for the loss of abolished likin. It has been announced and levied for a long time, and the Finance Department has repeatedly telegraphed to urge payment, as urgent as a shooting star. However, the chambers of commerce of various counties all said that there was no business at all after the great flood, the finances were exhausted, and they were unable to bear it. Letters and telegrams flew in, requesting the provincial government to exempt them to relieve the merchants' difficulties. They have not yet paid. Wuhu is a major port in Anhui Province. Merchants from various counties mostly regard Wuhu merchants as following or disobeying. Recently, the provincial government issued a strict announcement to urge the payment of business tax to Wuhu, and the Wuhu collection office posted it in front of the chamber of commerce, with the intention of "taking a zither and singing." The county chamber of commerce also held a meeting on the 4th and decided to persuade the merchants of various guilds to pay one-fourth of the annual tax, that is, to ask the provincial government to exempt the tax from January to September of this year. After this case was resolved, the collection office was not notified. Unexpectedly, on the 7th of this month, the collection office received a telegram from the Finance Department, limiting the payment of 30,000 yuan by telegraph transfer by the 8th. If they violated it, they would be punished. In a hurry, the collection office sent tax collectors everywhere to strictly urge the payment of taxes from various shops. Because they had not received the notice from the chamber of commerce, most of the shops refused to pay. The tax collectors then illegally detained Liu Shilin, the manager of Hongdasheng Grocery Store, and sent him to the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau for detention. Cuishengheng, Changshun, and other shops were also harassed. That night, the grocery industry held an emergency meeting and went to the county chamber of commerce to request maintenance. Tao Yutang and other three standing committee members of the chamber of commerce negotiated with the Public Security Bureau and released Liu Shilin first to appease the public anger. This morning (the 8th), the county chamber of commerce specially convened an emergency meeting of the whole body to discuss countermeasures, and publicly decided to send a letter to the collection office to question the reasons for detaining the merchants. At the same time, it sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, asking the Anhui Finance Department to approve the exemption of the business tax for this year. After the meeting, Zhao, the director of the Public Security Bureau, Yu, the county magistrate, and Yan Jingyi, the director of the collection office, were invited to the meeting to negotiate a good method. The three parties decided to pay one-fourth of the tax within a week and hand it over by the chamber of commerce. Unexpectedly, the office then sent personnel to Cuishengheng Shop to continue to force the collection of taxes. Because the shop refused, it asked the county government to detain Yan Qiu, the manager of the shop, accusing him of resisting the payment of national taxes. The merchants were therefore very angry. Both sides went to extremes, and it is feared that it will lead to a strike. (November 8th)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Indicates There is a Way to Repair the Canal Embankment</h3>
<p>▲The Entire Project Can Be Completed in Four Months</p>
<p>Ye Chucang, the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, recently telegraphed Han Zishi, the executive chairman of the Jiangbei Flood Relief Association, inviting representatives from various counties to the province to discuss ways to repair the canal embankment. Han then accompanied 37 representatives from 11 counties, including Hu Zhen, Ma Shijie, and Bao Xiangzhong, on a special ship to Zhenjiang. At 9:00 am on the 8th, they went to the provincial government. Ye Chucang and Shen Boxian invited them into the provincial committee conference room for talks. First, Han Zishi said, "We are very grateful for the Chairman's detailed answers to the notes submitted by Guojun the other day. However, we believe that there are still some points that are not clear about the signed replies: (1) Fundraising, (2) Material transportation, and (3) Completion period. If the embankment is not blocked for a day, the people of more than a dozen counties in the Lixia River cannot live in peace for a day. Now we are honored to be invited to the province by the Chairman and Director Shen by telegram. I hope that the Chairman and Director can give us more guidance so that the representatives can return to their counties and comfort the victims." Ye said, "(1) In terms of funding, the original budget for blocking the gaps was 860,000 yuan, and the estimated cost for repairing the entire embankment was 2 million yuan. Among them, 1 million yuan will be used from the construction mu donation of various counties, and the other 1 million yuan will be the Yunhe Association funds allocated by the Central Flood Relief Committee. These two types of funds are absolutely guaranteed. For the remaining amount, there are still 4 million yuan of public bonds, which can be calculated at 60% off, and 2.4 million yuan can be obtained. There are also 50,000 tons of American wheat coming to Zhenjiang for Jiangbei, (80 yuan per ton) which can be distributed to the Yunhe embankment as a work relief. According to the 5 million yuan you have set, it should not be a problem. (2) In terms of materials, there are some difficulties due to time constraints. The difficulty is not in purchasing, but in transportation. Because the canal water is small, transportation is inconvenient. Recently, the government has hired shallow-water boats in Suzhou and Wuxi. If shallow-water boats cannot travel, it is planned to lay light railways on the Yunhe embankment. Because the bricks are not made in time, it is planned to use cement bricks instead. 15,000 square meters of stone have been purchased. (3) In terms of the completion period, it has been discussed with Director Shen. If there are no difficulties in funding and materials, it can be completed within four months and will never be delayed until after the peach blossom flood next year. As for the project, Director Shen will report in detail." Then, Shen Boxian said, "The Chairman has already answered the funding. Now I will talk about the materials and engineering in general. (1) For the stone in terms of materials, Director Sun had already signed a contract during his tenure, with 10,000 square meters set in Qixia Mountain and 5,000 square meters in Longtan. Only because the contractor lost money, it could not be delivered as scheduled. It is currently under negotiation. The remaining 5,000 square meters have been contracted to another merchant. Because the weather is getting colder and the blanks are not easy to burn, cement bricks will be made at the Longtan Cement Factory. Because cement becomes stronger and stronger after soaking in water, it can be used as much as possible. It is planned to transfer more than a dozen shallow-water boats to transport them in batches. If there is no interruption, they can be transported in three months. (2) In terms of engineering, it is planned to borrow 50,000 tons of American wheat to provide food for 200,000 victims to work for six months. It will take about four months to repair the entire embankment. The current section of Laisheng Temple can be closed on the 12th of this month, and the Dangjun Tower can also be cut off before the 20th. It has been decided to first block the five small dams. As for the larger Phoenix and Gecko dams, it is planned to block them after the gap in the Dangjun Tower is closed. In general, all gaps and dams can be blocked and completed in November, and the Yunhe embankment will be repaired in December." Then, representatives Hu Zhen, Ma Shijie, Chen Kanghe, Dai Tianqiu, Bao Xiangzhong, Xu Zhongling, Cui Liusan, Zhou Xiangting, and others spoke successively and discussed until 12 o'clock before leaving. On the 9th, the representatives again pushed Han Zishi into the government to talk to Secretary-General Jin about everything. At about 10 o'clock, they took the original ship back to Jiangbei.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Water Police in Shanghai Again Capture Kidnappers: Fan Guozhong, the captain of the 1st Water Police Team, led his subordinates on the 7th of this month to capture Shu Hongxiang, a small leader of the Hu bandits, nicknamed Chang Ban Ahe, in the Shuangfengyuan Tea House at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hede Road in Shanghai. He confessed that he was 33 years old and from Shanyang. Last year, he gathered a crowd to rob the family of Wang Jieshi in Fuhuangkan, Jinshan. Later, he joined Tai Bao Ashu Gang as a captain. He killed officials and robbed weapons in Lvxiang, Taozhuang, and Gao Xu Jinjiazhuang in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. On July 23 of this year, he opened fire with the water police in Fanbang New Town and fled home. He formed his own force at the junction of Songjiang and Jinshan and specialized in kidnapping. The stolen money he obtained so far has been spent in Shanghai. This summer, he killed Jia Sheng, a water police informant, in a vendetta in Zhoujiadu. In July, he kidnapped a man in a five-room house in Hengliaojing. Because he was careless in watching the ticket, he was escaped. On the night of October 21, he gathered a crowd to rob Sun Youfeng and other eight merchants in Liujiayan Bridge, Jinshan County. Captain Fan has prepared a document and escorted him to the superior for interrogation.</p>
<p>The Robbery of Hengchang Bank in Fengjing: The report yesterday stated that the Dachang Rice Shop in Dongzha, Fengjing, was robbed on the night of the 8th. It was a mistake for Hengchang Bank. It was in Jiashan County, under the jurisdiction of the town. More than 3,000 yuan of banknotes were robbed. On the same night, a certain rice shop in Songjing of the town did have a theft case. It was also heard that there were two bandit ships in the Jiezizhen area outside Beizha, carrying bandits to carry out a large-scale looting. The 1st Branch of the Public Security Bureau of the town has reported the case and ordered the arrest.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>A Large Gang of Lake Bandits Discovered Near Turtle Mountain: On the morning of the 10th, it was discovered near Turtle Mountain in Xiangshan Township, under the jurisdiction of the county, that there were 70 to 80 lake bandits, parked more than a dozen boats, with the intention of robbing nearby villages. At that time, the villagers were very panicked. Fortunately, the Xiangshan Town Water and Land Police and the Defense Corps learned of it early and led a team to pursue and suppress it. Seeing that there were many officers and soldiers, the bandits did not dare to underestimate the enemy and fled towards Taihu Lake.</p>
<p>Bandits Run Rampant and Kidnappings Are Frequently Heard: Bandits have been rampant in Suzhou recently, and the villagers are restless. More than a dozen bandits came to Zou Yuanshun Grocery Store in Laocun, Xiangshan Township, under the jurisdiction of the county, on the night of the 9th and looted wantonly. When they left, they kidnapped the owner of the shop, Zou Shifu, and his neighbor, Zou Aquan. There were also seven bandits who came to the home of Zhu Jinfu, a villager in Daoren Bang, Yinshan Township, on the night of the 9th, arbitrarily searched and looted, losing about two or three hundred yuan. Yesterday (the 10th), the Public Security Bureaus of each place reported to the county government to request an arrest.</p>
<p>Another Message About the Robbed Steamer: The Feiyun Steamer of Tongyuan Bureau, which opened in Dongshan, was robbed on the way on the 1st of this month. The details have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that in addition to the more than ten hostages who have been released, there are still Yan, Ye, Chu, and Gao, four men, and five women who have not escaped danger and are still in the bandit's lair. All the family members are worried. The families of the hostages are not wealthy. For example, Yan is just an old servant in a bank in Shanghai, earning dozens of yuan a month, which is used to support a family of several people. Since he was kidnapped, his wife has been in despair because she has no one to rely on. It is also very tragic.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Two Suicide Cases in One Day: A traveler arrived at the Mengyuan Inn, Mengyuan Alley, Tongyun Road, outside the Guangfu Gate, the afternoon before yesterday. He claimed to be Yan Guobao and booked Room No. 5. He paid a deposit of one yuan. He got up and went out once the next day. He returned to the inn at 12 o'clock and looked normal. Then he went to bed. By evening, Zhou Xicheng, the teahouse of the inn, thought that the traveler had been sleeping soundly during the day and had not had dinner at this time, so he opened the door and went inside. He suddenly saw the traveler lying on the bed, his face pale. He called him but he did not respond. He had already died. He immediately reported to the accounting room. He entered the room to check and found two opium bamboo leaves and two letters of suicide. After examining the contents, he learned that the deceased was not Yan Guobao, but Yan Linfa, 26 years old, from Sanyan Bridge, Jiangdong, Ningbo. He is now a copper worker at Gantai Silk Factory in Yefangchang, this county. He is married and has a daughter. Recently, he suddenly became acquainted with Ren Rudai, a female worker in the same factory. They were deeply in love and wanted to marry her as a concubine. At the beginning of last month, Linfa took Rudai back to his hometown, and was severely reprimanded by his father, Yan Heshang. When they came to Wuxi again on the 14th, they were spotted by Rudai's biological father just as they arrived at the station, and were twisted into the Public Security Bureau. They were fined 20 yuan and released from the bureau. Rudai was taken back by her father to be disciplined. Therefore, Linfa was deeply stimulated and suddenly had the idea of suicide. After this incident occurred, Cheng Wensen, the manager of the inn, reported to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau in charge for investigation, and also reported to Gantai Silk Factory to report to the family members of the deceased to come to Wuxi to handle the funeral affairs. Yesterday (the 10th) afternoon at 3:00, Prosecutor Du went to the inn to verify the death by poisoning. After the verification, he ordered the inn to prepare a coffin for collection and burial, and asked the family members of the deceased to come to Wuxi to claim the coffin. In addition, Liu Erbao, a Shanghai man, came to Wudong First Inn the day before yesterday and opened Room No. 4. Yesterday, the teahouse of the inn thought that the traveler had not gotten up at 12 o'clock, and became suspicious. He opened the door and went inside. He saw the traveler lying stiffly on the bed, without any breath, and there was fresh blood flowing from his mouth. It looked like he had taken poison. He immediately reported to the accounting room and reported to the picture above. It was decided to report to the county court prosecutor's office for verification today (the 11th) for encoffining and burial.</p>
<p>Petition to Reduce and Issue Police Salaries: Wuxi County's finances have long been on the verge of bankruptcy. Chen, the county magistrate, proposed it to the previous county political meeting. It was resolved to hand it over to Wang Li, the director of the Finance Bureau, for review. As a result, he proposed an opinion to pay 90% of the various regular expenses in the civil affairs expenses from October, according to the example of last year. The heads of each branch bureau and the police asked their respective superiors for assistance because it was related to the reduction of salaries. Each branch bureau then elected Gao Chongshan, the head of the First Branch Bureau, as the chief representative to petition the Public Security Bureau and ask the county government to maintain the original plan. However, the county government could not find the funds, so it was difficult to solve it for a while.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Dissolution of the Silk Fabric Industry Association: The case of the evil merchants in Wuyi destroying the county party headquarters and other three agencies was resolved by the provincial party headquarters to dissolve the Geqiu Silk Fabric Industry Association of the county and inform the province to order the county government to comply.

<p>Hostage Escapes from the Bandit's Nest: Ding Xulin, from Xuanjiatang Village, Guotangqiao Town, Fourth District, Wuyi, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits at home on the 19th of last month. More than 20 days have passed. The night before, he suddenly escaped from the bandit's lair. According to him, his eyes were blindfolded in the bandit's lair and he could not tell day from night. The day before yesterday, he suddenly heard gunfire, which caused the bandits guarding him to flee in panic. Then he broke free from the ropes and was able to escape.</p>

The steps were quite neat and the spirit was very good. After circling the exercise field for a week, they gathered in front of the stage.</p>
<p>▲Report from the presidium: Chairman Wen Guangbi reported, saying that since the Northeast Incident, the people of the country have been determined to overthrow imperialism. Therefore, our people across the country should arm themselves. In particular, the organization of our students is not backward. Therefore, today is the grand review of the second district of the Youth Volunteer Army, which has two meanings: (1) The people of the whole country are armed to overthrow Japanese imperialism, and our Youth Volunteer Army is the vanguard; (2) A manifestation of the greatest determination. This time is our armed resistance against Japan. In addition, we must step up military training in order to achieve our goals.</p>
<p>▲Speech by the reviewing officer: Reviewing Officer He Liangxin gave a speech, saying that everyone's spirit is very good today. It is really enviable to have such good training in this short period of time. However, we must not only have neat steps, but also be able to endure hardship. We have a consistent spirit, and then we can defeat Japan. We should obey the iron-like rules and have the spirit of enduring hardship, and I hope that you will make great progress in the future.</p>
<p>▲Speech by the Municipal Party Department: Yu Zhongbiao, representative of the Municipal Party Department, offered three points of advice: (1) The will to avenge the country; (2) To have a persistent spirit; (3) To have the determination to not fear hardship or death.</p>
<p>▲Speeches by representatives: Hu Shuhua briefly said that the meaning of our joining the Volunteer Army should have the spirit of wisdom, benevolence, and courage. The Germans used to say, "Our bullets are not fired inward, but forward." Therefore, our bullets must also go forward. I hope that the government can issue guns to us so that we can gain practical skills. In addition, we must also work hard to study, because foreign wars are completely fought with aircraft and all kinds of scientific weapons. We must work hard to make a large amount of steel and build steel plants, so that we can have substantial strength. Then Pan Gongzhan gave a speech, briefly saying that Japan is occupying our territory in this way because it is completely lured by non-resistance. If there is resistance, I believe they would not dare to do this. In addition, Zhu Yingpeng, Zhao Junmai, and Sun Yuanzeng also gave speeches in succession, and the words were majestic and moving.</p>
<p>▲Slogans of the大会: (1) Forever be loyal and courageous citizens; (2) Swear to avenge China's national humiliation; (3) Restore China's territory; (4) Revitalize the Chinese nation; (5) Overthrow Japanese imperialism; (6) Long live the Three Principles of the People; (7) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<p>▲The Fourth District Grand Review Held This Morning: The review period for the first group of the fourth district was originally scheduled to be held on the 9th, but after the schools being reviewed requested a postponement in order to prepare properly, the department decided to change it to today (the 11th) at 9:00 am. The first and second groups of the fourth district will be held at the same time at the West Gate Public Sports Field. The schools being reviewed are: Dongya College of Physical Education, Datong University, College of Political Science and Law, Sino-French College of Engineering, Sino-French College of Pharmacy, National Conservatory of Music, Jiaotong University, Aurora University, Tongde Medical College, Shanghai Art College, Shanghai National Medical College, Shanghai Journalism College, Chinese Medical College, and Xinhua Art College, totaling 14 schools. This is an unprecedented grand review of the Youth Volunteer Army of various universities. The presidium will be composed of the Military Training Department of the Student Union, the Sino-French College, and Aurora University. The reviewing officers are Xiao Xueyuan, Zhou Jiashou, Chen Dongsheng, and Wang Zongdao. The Liangjiang Women's College of Physical Education and the China Sports School will also participate in the performance. The department has also invited Zhang Yuejun, Feng Yong, and other important figures to attend the ceremony. If there is light rain, it will still be held on time to show the spirit that the Youth Volunteer Army should have.</p>
<h3>Students of the Military Academy Returning from Japan Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>▲The Municipal Government Issues Free Train Tickets</p>
<p>(Shanghai News) There are more than 200 students of the military academy who have returned from Japan after dropping out of school. They are now working hard for the Anti-Japanese National Salvation at the YMCA on the side of Wanjincheng Bank. Because the residence is located in the concession, it is not conducive to the progress of the work, and the government has not been able to quickly accommodate them in the corresponding educational institutions so that they can continue their studies and serve the country as soon as possible. Therefore, at the general meeting on the morning of the 9th, it was decided that all would go to Beijing to petition in order to achieve the goal of completing their studies, and to ask the Training Directorate and the Ministry of Education to provide them with economic assistance. It is scheduled to go to Beijing tomorrow (the 12th) at 11:00 am. It is reported that 64 people have registered. It is said that some have already gone to Beijing in advance, and another part are temporarily postponing their trip to Beijing for personal reasons. Therefore, the 64 people were promised free train tickets by the municipal government yesterday. It is said that after going to Beijing, they will vow to work hard for the Anti-Japanese National Salvation, which is easier to carry out than in the Shanghai concession.</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Educational Investigation Mission Criticizes Chinese Education for Violating Economic Principles</h3>
<p>▲The Investigation Mission Has Come to Shanghai for Inspection</p>
<p>(Hangzhou Communication) The League of Nations Educational Investigation Mission, including members Walters and others, a group of five people, came to Hangzhou to investigate education. They have been going to Xianghu and other places in Hangzhou to investigate for days, and have completed their official business and left the province. The criticisms made by the mission in this investigation can be summarized as follows: 1. China pays attention to the development of university education, forgetting the popularization of primary and secondary school education. For example, in Beijing, universities are lined up for normal education. There is both the Department of Education of Peking University and the establishment of a normal university. Examining its content, there is no difference at the beginning, and neither is specially facilitated. It can be merged into one. 2. The level of secondary school education is too poor, which makes it impossible to improve the level of university. 3. China is rich in resources, but no one pays attention to utilization. Vocational education should be promoted as much as possible to enrich people's lives. 4. The moral education of general students is not good. At this time, students' words and deeds are often excessive. In short, Chinese education violates economic principles.</p>
<p>Bake and other members of the League of Nations Educational Investigation Mission, accompanied by Wang Shenming, Commissioner of the Ministry of Education, and education experts Hu Gangfu and Chen Hansheng, etc., passed through Shanghai from Beijing to Hangzhou a few days ago. They visited the local education in Hangzhou in great detail and had a good impression. They came to Shanghai on the evening of the 8th and planned to stay for four days before going to Wuxi. The night before last night, Director Xu of the Education Bureau hosted a banquet for the mission at Xinghualou. Many educational issues were discussed during the banquet. The guests and hosts broke up at 9:00 pm. Yesterday, they visited Wuben Girls' School, Shanghai High School, and the Chinese Vocational School. Today, they will visit the Municipal Education Bureau.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Party Department Stops Illegal Assemblies Such as the Modern Middle School</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department of this city reported yesterday that the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association of Secondary School Students stated that five schools, including Modern Middle School and the High School Attached to Jinan University, had issued a notice stating that the fifth representative meeting would be convened at the Xiaoximen Youth Propaganda Team at 1:00 pm on the 11th (today). The investigation of the representative meeting's convening procedures should be the responsibility of the Joint Association's Executive Committee. However, the Executive Committee has not made such a resolution, and the notice issued by Modern Middle School and others is not stamped, which is obviously a false name used by villains to destroy the association's system, which is illegal. Please stop it, etc. It is heard that the Municipal Party Department has reported the case and asked the Public Security Bureau to stop it.</p>
<h3>News from the Anti-Japanese Joint Association of Middle School Students</h3>
<p>▲Yuan Jiliang, a representative of the Civilian Stand, Issues a Letter of Weeping to Fellow Students</p>
<p>Yuan Jiliang, a representative of the Civilian Stand of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association of Shanghai Secondary School Students, issued a letter of weeping to fellow students regarding the association's disputes, saying, "Students, this is such a heartbreaking thing. At a time when violent Japan is increasingly invading, our Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Middle Schools has caused great disputes over a small matter. This is an extremely unfortunate thing. Students, our goal is to resist Japan and save the country. Our object is Japan. We should not have opinions because of personal problems, which will put our entire Anti-Japanese Association of Middle Schools in a situation of eternal destruction. Today, when I saw the news in the newspapers that I had violently assaulted the chairman, my hot tears burst out like a tide. Now I don't want to explain the details of the dispute at that time in detail. I think the representatives who were present that day can understand it. If representative Li Binjun of the Huiling can speak with a clear conscience, then I am willing to accept the most severe punishment, go to the guillotine, go to the execution ground, everything is willing, and be dominated by the entire middle school students of the city. Students, the national situation is so critical, but we still cannot unite, then what face do we have to meet the martyrs under the nine springs? Yuan Jiliang, representative of the Civilian Stand, wept, November 10th."</p>
<h3>The Delegation of the Anti-Japanese Associations of Various Universities to Beijing to Attend the National Student Federation Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Associations of various universities in this city had elected 11 people, including Xu Guanbin, Wu Baojin, Yin Bojun, Zhang Shousong, Tian Long, Lu Zhaozhen, Jiang Peng, Wu Shumo, Hu Wenquan, Wang Fuzu, and Chen Chunchang, to go to Beijing to attend the preparatory meeting of the National Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation, and gave them two major principles: (1) The meeting place must be in Shanghai; (2) The number of representatives attending should be proportional to the number of schools in each place. Unexpectedly, both of the above points were rejected, and they immediately declared that they would return to Shanghai to ask for instructions. It is heard that the delegation returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday to report on the process.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Education Association Was Not Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>(National News Agency) The Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Education Association of this city held a city-wide representative meeting at Wuben Girls' School in Ximen at 2:00 pm yesterday, preparing to formally establish it. The Municipal Party Department sent Tong Xingbai to attend and guide the meeting. As only 13 representatives, including Tao Baichuan, Zhou Feicheng, Guo Weiping, and Huang Zhaoxiong, attended the meeting, which was not enough to meet the legal quorum, the meeting was adjourned. The Preparatory Committee will postpone the meeting and reconvene the representative meeting.</p>
<p>Also, the Municipal Education Bureau believes that the representatives of each district have not been fully produced, and the draft articles of association of the Municipal Education Association are still awaiting review. The Municipal Education Bureau issued an order a few days ago to postpone the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Education Association and the Education Associations of each district.</p>
<h3>The Executive Committee of the Anti-Japanese Associations of Various Universities</h3>
<p>▲Decided to Hold a City-Wide Representative Meeting on the 13th ▲Telegraphed to Console Ma Zhanshan for Killing Thieves and Resisting Violence</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association of various universities in this city held the 23rd executive committee meeting at the Youth Propaganda Team at 2:00 pm yesterday. 14 executive members from various schools attended the meeting.

<h3>Death of the Principal of Zhende Girls' Middle School</h3>
<p>Ms. Shen Qinru, principal of Shanghai Zhende Girls' Middle School, founded the school more than ten years ago. She has always been responsible for promoting women's education and has cultivated many younger generations. Unfortunately, she died of overwork on the 9th of this month at her residence in Shanghai. From then on, another talent in the field of women's education has been weakened.</p>

<h3>Chinese Race Walking Team Completes Three 17-Mile Trial Runs</h3>
<p>▲Shi Jinsheng Still Takes First Place</p>
<p>The upcoming International Race Walking Competition is scheduled to be held on the 6th of next month. To prepare for this competition, the Chinese team held its third full-length race walk of seventeen miles (approximately over fifty Chinese miles) last Sunday morning. The veteran team members included Shi Jinsheng, Hou Genren, Xie Xingdao, Zhou Ruquan, Cheng Xuan, Liu Jiajun, and Yue Meigang. The new team members included Xu Aichen, Wang Longbao, Lü Chongyi, Jiang Lvcun, Zhang Zhihe, Sun Shouchu, Ling Baorong, Ling Peng, Deng Guang, Chen Liwen, Yu Gaosheng, Qiu Dechang, Zhang Xianlun, and many others. There were also two young team members, Gu Yuanzhen and Wang Mengmao. All started from the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road. A horse-drawn carriage accompanied them to carry the team members' clothes and belongings. Mr. Shi Youhui, who is enthusiastic about this event, is not in Shanghai, so Mr. Ge Zhonggao is temporarily recording time along the way for future reference. Zhou Yuyu and Lu Yutian were also invited to guide and care for them along the way. As a result, all reached the finish line. Shi Jinsheng still took first place, but his performance was slightly worse than last time because of the Western Union football match in the afternoon, so it was more of a casual practice. Hou Genren was second, Xie Xingdao was third, and Zhou Ruquan was fourth. Their results were all good. After our Chinese team reached the finish line, Mr. King, a famous British race walker, and Mr. Newkiborg from Germany also arrived one after another. Unfortunately, the starting times were different, so it was impossible to know who was better. In addition, a foreigner named A. Jets drove a car along the way to take care of them and provided the athletes with coffee, tea and bread, which can be compared with Mr. Cheng Shibi.</p>
<p>▲The Educational News on the 10th carried a record of the 4th Representative Assembly of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of Middle School Students (according to the manuscript sent by the Shanghai News Agency). It also included the name of yours truly as being present. I was deeply surprised. Upon investigation, when the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of Middle School Students held its 4th Representative Assembly at the Minli Girls' Middle School at 2 PM on the 8th, some representatives questioned the matter of the five representatives attending the National Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of Students. Subsequently, they withdrew from the meeting, causing considerable chaos in the meeting place. Afterwards, the acting chairman, Mr. Zhao Lianfu, announced the adjournment. Yours truly immediately returned to the ministry. Therefore, there was no motion passed at the meeting that day. The news on the 10th must have been a mistake. Since the matter involves yours truly being present, I request a correction. Yu Zhongbiao, 11/10</p>

<h3>Special Martial Law Imposed in Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>▲May Need to be Extended Beyond the 16th</p>
<p>Since the news of the Tianjin Incident reached Shanghai the day before yesterday, the police authorities of both the Chinese and concession areas in Shanghai immediately ordered increased defenses. In addition to the concession area being stricter than usual, the Chinese area announced special martial law from last night. All district offices under the Public Security Bureau worked overtime. Vehicles passing through were inspected. If necessary, the martial law order may be extended beyond the 16th. In other areas, such as the important intersections of North Sichuan Road, Baoshan Road, Haining Road, Xinzha Bridge, and Xinda Bridge, which are on the border between the Chinese and concession areas, armed soldiers were specially assigned to guard them. Patrol teams were fully mobilized, shuttling back and forth. The defenses were unusually tight.</p>
<h3>More Than 160 Trade Associations Declare Support for Peaceful Unification</h3>
<p>▲First, it must be realized immediately ▲Second, there must be permanent guarantees</p>
<p>More than 160 trade associations in the city issued a declaration yesterday supporting peaceful unification, saying, "An ancient saying goes, 'Life is really difficult; who can escape death?'" Judging from historical precedents, for the life of an entire nation to fail to focus on peaceful development and instead proceed on a path towards destruction, such狂惑失心behavior is exactly what the proverb means when it says, "You reap what you sow." There is no way that the life of that nation will be spared. The demise of the Ming Dynasty was caused by the internal strife of Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, while the Qing people invaded from the outside. Famine spread throughout the country, but the Donglin and Fushe factions still fought endlessly, eventually leading to the collapse of the dynasty and failing to preserve even the remnants of Jiangzuo. The symptoms of our country today are similar to those of the late Ming Dynasty, but the foreign troubles are even worse. Since the violent Japanese spread their poison to the Northeast, they captured thousands of miles of Liaoning and Jilin in one day and night with thousands of troops, seizing the accumulated wealth of the arsenal for years. The rotting and demise opened a precedent unprecedented in five thousand years of history. As a result, the court and the public were shocked. The progressive members of the party and the state in Beijing and Guangdong began to gather in Shanghai to discuss national affairs. Unexpectedly, instead of embracing each other and crying bitterly, both sides used harsh words of criticism. The Japanese invaders then gained more and more ground, and the border troubles deepened. This is like the Longwu Emperor of the late Ming Dynasty, struggling in Zhejiang and Fujian, while the Tang and Lu princely clans were constantly at odds, only to fuel the flames of the enemy and hasten the national demise. When the news came, we were shocked and heartbroken. At this critical moment, fortunately, there was a sudden reversal, and the life of the nation was saved from collapse. However, the situation is so critical that there is no room for complacency. In terms of foreign troubles, Liaoning and Jilin have been lost for nearly two months. Recruiting rebels and plundering annual revenues, the enemy's arrangements are already solid, and it will be more difficult for us to recover. Unless we strengthen the power of the central government and determine a plan for resisting foreign aggression, the Liaoning issue will be impossible to resolve. In terms of the social economy, political instability will lead the social economy to the brink of collapse. In recent months, dangerous signs have been fully exposed, and there is no room for concealment. If these dangerous signs are prolonged, the country will fall into bankruptcy, and the national finances will immediately fall into a desperate situation. The collapse of everything is inevitable. Therefore, our association dares to hold the following two meanings to seek the approval of the people of the country: (1) Peaceful unification must be realized immediately. (2) Peaceful unification must have permanent guarantees. Since the completion of the Northern Expedition in the 16th year of the Republic of China, all citizens believed that the situation of warlord separatism for more than ten years had come to an end, and a new political life had begun. Therefore, they exhausted the financial resources of the Southeast to help the national construction plan. In the past three or four years, we have issued 600 to 700 million public bonds, almost all of which were financed by the Shanghai market. It is not that Shanghai merchants have surplus financial resources to undertake this huge task. It is only because we believe that unification has been achieved and construction has begun, so we are exhausting our limited capabilities to avoid falling short. Unexpectedly, the ideal is contrary to the fact. Banditry and war disasters are more severe than before. The fragmentation of the country and the憔悴顚連of the people are almost all beyond our expectations. Therefore, the four words "peaceful unification" are not only a tool to deal with foreign troubles at present, but should be regarded as a good medicine for treating the country. This aspiration will not change, and we will stake our lives on it. If things are tight, then we will ease the situation to thank the people of the country. If things are settled, then we will each set up our own banner and compete for dominance, which will inevitably lead to a cycle of internal wars, making it impossible for the Chinese nation to ever recover and rejuvenate. If there are unfortunately any害羣之馬, our association will regard them as the common enemy of our nation and will wield the whip to deal with them. Not only that, but the nation can look forward to a long and lasting peace. This kind of苟安psychology is definitely not suitable for the current national situation. Today, at the very least, we should strive for political clarification and budget consolidation under the united leadership of the advanced members of the party and the state, and allow professional groups to participate in meetings, adopt true popular opinions, and implement a full-fledged national politics, so that the so-called peaceful unification will be a sound peaceful unification, not a cosmetic peaceful unification. Only then can we effectively pacify the country and resist foreign aggression, and not just engage in empty talk. In addition to sending representatives from our association to the Beijing-Guangdong peace representatives to petition and appeal, we also hope that all industrial and commercial groups and people's organizations in the country will unanimously advocate and urge the government to implement peaceful unification immediately, so that we can cure the chronic illness and save the critical situation. We respectfully declare this with anticipation. Shanghai Coal Ash Industry Association and more than 160 other trade associations.</p>
<h3>Northeast Petition Delegation Returns to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Feng Yong Will Still Need to Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Northeast People's Petition Delegation came to Shanghai to petition for peaceful unification and joint resistance to foreign aggression. After arriving in Shanghai, the peace conference happened to end. Therefore, the day before yesterday, they separately visited the representatives of this city and Mr. Hu Zhentang. The results were satisfactory. After the matter was completed, at 6:00 AM yesterday, the Railway Bureau prepared a special train. The entire petition delegation of more than 500 people, led by Commander-in-Chief Feng Yong and Wang Huayi, boarded the train to Beijing at the North Station yesterday morning. At that time, representatives of various industrial, commercial, and school groups in Shanghai came to the station to see them off. The train left the station at 6:00 AM. Feng Yong also went with them. However, Jiang Leshan of the General Affairs Department only took a train to Beijing in the afternoon yesterday. It is reported that the delegation will petition once again after arriving in Beijing. They will stay for about three or four days and then return north. Commander-in-Chief Feng may still need to come to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow is the Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Birth</h3>

<h3>Various Sectors Send Telegrams to Comfort Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>The Postal Workers' Union and 77 other unions made important expressions yesterday regarding the heroic resistance of Ma Zhanshan, the Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang Province. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Telegram to the National Government: To the Esteemed National Government, the Japanese army, under the cover of a large force, forcibly repaired the Nenjiang Bridge, and was severely hit by our Heilongjiang army head-on, inflicting heavy damage. Hearing this from afar, we are extremely happy and comforted.

<p>▲The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed Ma Zhanshan, saying, "To Acting Chairman Ma of the Qiqihar Provincial Government, the violent enemy is pressing in, and the cities are falling. You alone are responsible for defending the territory, supervising and leading your troops, fighting hard and bleeding. The battle of Nenjiang is comparable to the battle of Liangshan. It makes the cunning enemy know that Qin is not without people. Your subordinates and generals are truly worthy of the important task of defending the country. The good news has arrived in Shanghai, and everyone is paying their respects. We express the Shanghai merchants' condolences and encouragement. We hope that you will continue to work hard and secure Longsha with the stability of Bao Sang. The key to the northern gate depends on you, sir.

<p>▲The Party Headquarters of the Two Railways Telegraphed: The Party Headquarters of the Two Railways telegraphed Acting Chairman Ma, saying, "The country is in crisis. To Acting Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang Province and all the soldiers at the front, the violent Japanese have no regard for China, forcibly occupying our Eastern Provinces, massacring our compatriots, destroying our public and private property, and plundering our mining rights, disregarding international credibility, and breaking the peace that the world is protecting. Everyone with morals is filled with pain and anger. Recently, the violent Japanese have become even more intensified, disregarding the League of Nations, and deciding to expand the scope of military operations. Not only are they not withdrawing troops on time, but they are also actively preparing their horses and sharpening their weapons to aggressively plot against Heilongjiang. Their cruelty and barbarity have reached the extreme. Fortunately, our loyal and patriotic General Ma and all the soldiers have defended the territory effectively and have not lost an inch of land, serving as a barrier for the people and a pillar for the country. The news has spread, and everyone is moved. We ask that you continue to fight hard and persevere to the end. Even with one soldier or one soldier, you must deal with the violent enemy. Our association pledges to lead the comrades of the two railways as a backing. As long as we have a breath, this aspiration will not change. The Executive Committee of the Special Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways extends its best wishes and gratitude.</p>
<p>▲Telegram from the Municipal Federation District Branch: (1) To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Nanjing National Government, the country is unfortunate, and the Japanese bandits are pressing in. Today, Acting Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang Province is firmly defending the territory. The battle of Nenjiang has terrified the violent Japanese. The good news has spread, and the entire city is admiring it. The mountains and rivers are shining. However, the isolated army is stubbornly defending, and the Japanese army will inevitably invade again. If there is no large army to assist, the rear defense is worrying. We hope that you will urge Deputy Commander Zhang to quickly send troops to reinforce Heilongjiang Province and eliminate the Japanese plainclothes troops in Tianjin nearby. Our more than 30 district branches are willing to lead more than 300,000 citizens in the city as the government's backing. In addition to sending telegrams of condolences, we specially telegram you to fight for the country and eliminate the Japanese bandits. We are eagerly looking forward to it.

Subsequently, the Ministry of Industry contacted the Ministry of Transportation, ordering the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other shipping companies to load coal from Qingdao, Yantai, and other places. It is reported that due to the refusal of Chinese people to load Japanese ships, various ships are extremely crowded, and many ships requisitioned by the headquarters have not yet returned. In fact, it is not possible to send more ships. However, in order to relieve the urgent need for coal in Shanghai, the company has implemented increased shifts to transport more coal to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Ratepayers' Association Urges the Shanghai Municipal Council to Economize</h3>
<p>▲Dismiss Music Team, Employ Senior Chinese Staff▲Engineering Projects to be Carried Out Over Years, Staff Salary Reduction</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you to state that government agencies, whether central or local, have definite policies on finance. Before the European War, government finance was based on the policy of 'adjusting expenditure to income.' Afterwards, the reverse was true, and the policy of 'adjusting income to expenditure' was adopted. Moreover, the implementation of financial policies must take into account the economic capacity of the ratepayers. Private economy should not be inadequate while public economy is independent, because if the two cannot be balanced, it is better for private economy to be sufficient than for public economy to be. Furthermore, 'obtaining the greatest effect with the least amount of expense' is the highest principle in economics, and both public and private economies must adhere to it. This is well-known to your council. Since the European War, the finances of the defeated countries have indeed been stretched to the limit, and the finances of the victorious countries have also been stretched thin. In fact, all countries in the world after the European War have suffered greatly from financial panic. Moreover, the commercial depression in recent years has had a great impact on the public and private economies of various countries. Following this, Japan adopted a policy of austerity, the United States postponed its war debts for one year, and the British Labour Cabinet collapsed due to budget imbalances, and a national government was specially formed to tighten the budget in order to overcome the difficulties. From this, it can be seen that government finance cannot disregard the state of world commerce and the national economy, and expand at will without considering economy. Shanghai is the economic center of China and the eastern trade hub of the world. However, Shanghai is only a place for the gathering and distribution of commerce. Shanghai's commerce depends entirely on the Yangtze River basin and the north and south of China. Now, the floods in the Yangtze River basin are the largest in the history of China in sixty years, and after the Japanese military invasion of the three northeastern provinces, Shanghai's commerce has come to a standstill. Those living in Shanghai have not only spent huge sums of money on disaster relief but have also lost profits in commerce, so what is their predicament? This can be verified by the recent rental of new houses, which no one is willing to rent. The bustling market on the western side of Hankou Road is now often closed even though the doors are open, which is enough to prove the beginning of the decline of the market. Based on the above situation, your council's financial policy should be one of economy, and not simply seek to increase revenue to maintain budget balance. This is the common opinion of the citizens. Our association, looking at the decline of world commerce, observing the decline of national trade, and recently seeing the gradual decline of the market, specially requests your council to take large-scale economic austerity actions, and to pay special attention to reducing administrative expenses and suspending unnecessary undertakings. Furthermore, there are two types of municipal expenditures: active and passive. All municipal public utilities and capital expenditures fall into the former category because they are production costs. Educational expenditures, etc., fall into the latter category because they take a long time to take effect and cannot be measured in numbers. However, if we want to reduce them, the society and the country will suffer. In addition, police and health expenditures should be listed separately. The amount of expenditure should be proportional to the effectiveness of the service. For example, if the number of crimes increases, the police expenditure for defense must be expanded. However, whether the expansion is appropriate depends on whether the number of crimes is reduced. If the cost of defense and the number of crimes increase simultaneously, it is a great departure from the principles of economics. Therefore, the appropriateness of this expenditure depends entirely on the effectiveness of the service.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The following four points are the association's suggestions for economizing. If they are adopted, they will help to reduce the deficit in your council's budget next year. According to the report by the Director of Finance, the expenses in the 1932 budget exceed the income by as much as 2.9 million taels, which is truly alarming. (1) The music team (annual fee of 190,000 taels) should be disbanded directly, or it should be run by private individuals. This is not a necessary municipal undertaking. Moreover, it is unfair to use public funds to provide a small number of people with low-cost enjoyment. (2) The defense expenditure currently accounts for 39% of your council's annual income. However, if more senior staff are replaced by Chinese, it seems that a large amount of savings can be made in terms of salaries. This is not only the case for the police department, but also for other administrative departments. Our association has repeatedly asked your council to pay attention to the employment of senior Chinese staff, mainly because it is a way to save expenses. If your council can employ more Chinese staff, the item of exchange rate tightening subsidies in the current budget can be largely reduced, and the savings will not be small. (3) The expansion of public works is too rapid. The expenses for extending roads and other expenses are very large. If they can be economized, they will greatly help your council's finances. Our association is well aware that the repair of roads is closely related to the development of the city. Moreover, widening the roads can increase the land value along the roads and increase the council's tax revenue. However, because the land value increases, the rent will increase accordingly, and the impact on the cost of living for the citizens is not small. Extending the roads is not only a plan for the present, but also for the future. Therefore, the engineering aspect should be carried out over the years, and gradually constructed. We must not be too eager to see results, and make any one year's budget suffer from the pain of unequal income reduction. (4) Staff salaries should be excellent in order to attract talented and loyal service. However, there are many jobs that cannot be filled with large salaries. This has been proposed by the Economic Committee and has not yet been fully implemented. The monthly salary of the constables is still not enough to make them feel at ease under the current standard of living, while the monthly salary of the highest staff is sometimes 140 times higher, and the extra allowances are not included. British Prime Minister MacDonald has personally reduced his annual salary by £1,000 this time, which can be imitated. The above four points are just the most important ones. In short, the expenses for productive undertakings must be used, and the expenses for raising the knowledge of the citizens must be used. However, we should always seek the actual situation, not the superficial beauty. We should strive to reduce and exempt the taxes that are sufficient to create an increase in crime. This is the key to the prosperity and decline of the city. We have written to you accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and implement it quickly. This is addressed to Sir Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Council, from the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association. Sent on November 10th, 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>India Increases Customs Duties</h3>
<p>▲Effective from September 30th of This Year</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday received an instruction from the Ministry of Industry, stating: "In order to implement the order, according to the report from the Consulate in Yangon, the Indian government's budget for this year is insufficient by 3,950,000 shields. Yesterday, the Indian Minister of Finance passed an increase in various taxes in the Legislative Council. The increase in customs import duties is particularly heavy. The regulations will be implemented on September 30th, which will have an impact on our country's exports. A copy of the import duty schedule added by the Yangon Customs is translated and requested to be instructed to the domestic chambers of commerce for notification. In addition to the instructions, a copy of the original schedule is made and sent to each chamber of commerce for notification. The order reads as follows: The following are the new taxes. (1) All current tax rules, except for goods taxed at 8.5%, will be increased by an additional tax of one-quarter. (2) All newly established tax rules, except for raw cotton, machinery, and dyes, will continue to be taxed according to the amount. (3) Raw cotton will be taxed at six pies per pound, machinery will be taxed at 10% ad valorem, and dyes will be taxed at 10% ad valorem. (4) Unrefined sugar, which was taxed at 6 shields and 12 annas per 112 yards under the old tax, will be changed to 7 shields and 4 annas. (5) Boots and shoes, which were taxed at 20% under the old tax, will be changed to 40%, or a minimum of 4 annas per pair, whichever is higher. (6) Artificial silk, which was taxed at 10% under the old tax, will be changed to 15%. (7) Artificial silk woven goods, camphor, and light bulbs, which were taxed at 20% under the old tax, will be changed to 40%.</p>
<h3>Seafarers Oppose Registration</h3>
<p>▲Believing it to be an Oppressive Tax on Seafarers▲Petitioning the Ministry to Cancel It</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation promulgated new provisional regulations for seafarer management on the first day of this month, implementing seafarer registration. From shipowners and crew members to sailors and stokers, all must pay fees for registration. Those who do not obtain certificates will not be allowed to work, and the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau is responsible for handling the matter. After these new regulations arrived in Shanghai, the Shanghai seafarers' side, believing that there were as many as nine fee items, which were close to oppressive taxation, decided to resist unanimously. On the one hand, they petitioned the ministry to cancel the regulations, and on the other hand, they notified all seafarers not to register. The details of this matter are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>▲Content of the New Regulations The new provisional regulations for seafarer management have a total of 26 articles. Seafarers are divided into two categories: the navigation department and the engine department. Those belonging to the navigation department are captains, chief mates, second mates, third mates, helmsmen, boatswains, and sailors. Those belonging to the engine department are chief engineers, first engineers, second engineers, third engineers, machinists, oilers, chief stokers, and stokers. All navigation and engine seafarers must register and obtain certificates in accordance with the regulations for merchant ship officer certificates set by the ministry. Those who do not register and obtain certificates will not be allowed to work. The seafarers' certificate is called a handbook, which is provided by the maritime administration bureau for seafarers to apply for. Ship captains must apply to the maritime administration bureau when they are hired or retire, and crew members must follow the same procedure. Therefore, the registration fees are stipulated to be nine types: (1) Seafarer's handbook: 2 yuan per book. (2) Renewal of seafarer's handbook: 2 yuan. (3) Correction of seafarer's handbook: 5 jiao. (4) Captain's employment certificate: 2 yuan. (5) Captain's retirement certificate: 2 yuan. (6) Crew member's employment approval: 1 yuan. (7) Crew member's dismissal approval: 1 yuan. (8) Extension or renewal of crew member's employment contract: 1 yuan. (9) Certificate of loss or damage of crew member's roster: 5 yuan.</p>
<p>▲Suspension of Registration The seafarers in this city believe that the new regulations are designed to extract money in every possible way and unanimously oppose them. The Navigation General Association, as the main organization for seafarers, convened a meeting and unanimously decided not to recognize the regulations. The association immediately issued an emergency notice to notify all members and seafarers on various merchant ships not to register before this case is properly resolved. The notice is as follows: "We are writing to you to state that the Ministry of Transportation's newly promulgated provisional regulations for seafarer management have now been forwarded by the maritime administration bureaus of various places to the crew members to conduct registration. The items for collecting fees stipulated therein, from obtaining the seafarer's handbook to the employment and retirement of captains and crew members, as well as employment, dismissal, and contract extension and renewal, are all listed, totaling as many as nine items. This is an unprecedented evil precedent for extracting money from crew members, and the taxation is too harsh, opening up an unprecedented evil precedent for extracting money from seafarers. Our association has already held a meeting to discuss and argue with the Ministry of Transportation and the Maritime Administration Bureau, requesting cancellation, and has resolved to send a letter to colleagues, before the registration fees are canceled, we hope that you will take the overall interests of the crew members as the premise and do not go to register individually, in order to promote the authorities' reflection and to show public outrage, which cannot be ignored. We are writing to you to inform you of this matter, and we hope that you will pay attention to its implementation."</p>
<p>▲Petition for Cancellation Yesterday, the Navigation General Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau, stating: "In your bureau's letter of the 3rd of this month, regarding the implementation of the provisional regulations for seafarer management, we were asked to inform our members to register in accordance with the regulations, and the regulations were attached to the association. After a meeting, it was discussed that the regulations were not perfect, especially the various procedures and fees, which were numerous and large, and it seemed that the purpose of handling registration was entirely to collect a large sum of cash. In the end, it was like paying grain to the government to obtain a title. For crew members, the gains do not outweigh the losses, and it is deemed unacceptable. Professional personnel must have sufficient technical skills before they can obtain a corresponding job. It is almost impossible to borrow other external forces. Just think about the value of a ship, life, and property, the number is not small. The shipowners and insurance companies will never dare to treat people who do not know the inside story as a child's play. They do not enjoy certain benefits of the profession because of the existence or absence of registration. The government uses the power of supervision and assessment, but the fees stipulated in the regulations are as many as nine items. From obtaining the seafarer's handbook to the employment and retirement of captains and crew members, as well as the extension and renewal of contracts, all must pay fees. In view of this, the occupation of a crew member is equivalent to the sale and purchase of goods, like a tax on a customs card, and also like a broker's transaction of goods, from which a commission is drawn. There is more than one professional occupation that does not require technology. For example, in the recently announced rules for shipbuilding technicians, in addition to the certificate fee of two yuan, it has not been heard that a handling fee is charged for undertaking a certain ship, and then another fee is charged after completion. Not only is there no such harsh example in any professional occupation, but even if we look at ordinary occupations in society, can we choose one to justify the crew members? The answer is no. Moreover, crew members have already shouldered a huge burden. The so-called merchant ship officer's certificate requires a fee of more than 40 yuan, plus a doctor's examination fee of 10 yuan, and it is changed every five years. This is truly a heavy exploitation of crew members, and all the abilities to take and demand have been exhausted. Moreover, crew members' income is not originally from Su Feng. In recent years, the shipping industry has been in decline, and wages have been reduced. The occupation of crew members has long been outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and the livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult. At present, the government is calling for the revitalization of the shipping industry, and it is too late to treat, maintain, irrigate, and cultivate crew members. How can we bear to drain the pond to fish, but instead do things that harm them? This association believes that the collection of this handling fee is an unprecedented evil precedent for extracting money from crew members, sucking the marrow, and being too harsh. It is a self-destructive policy to destroy professional personnel. We should ask the ministry to transfer the entire handling fee for cancellation to reduce the burden and comfort the expectations.

<h3>Resolution on Salary Increase Plan for Employees of China Electric Company</h3>
<p>All employees of the China Electric Company requested the company to improve their treatment and a dispute arose. Through the efforts of party and government agencies, as well as Du Yuesheng, a director of the company, a satisfactory resolution was reached regarding the additional amount of subsidies for the employees for five months of this year, divided into three methods. The three points of the resolution are as follows: (1) The company agreed to pay the employees the additional amount of subsidies for four months of this year, which was issued by the company in full the day before yesterday. (2) The additional amount of subsidies for the other month was negotiated by Director Du Yuesheng, who persuaded the employees to voluntarily give up, and Director Du personally allocated 500 yuan to be used as an extra subsidy for the company's colleagues' mutual benefit association. (3) The employees' salary increase will be implemented starting in January 1920.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Japanese Textile Mills</h3>
<p>▲Reluctantly Opening Factories, Goods Piling Up Like Mountains▲Pressuring Chinese Workers to Voluntarily Strike</p>
<p>Since the various industries in this city have automatically refused to import Japanese raw materials for the sake of resisting Japan and saving the country, the Japanese-owned textile mills in China have been greatly affected, and sales have sharply decreased, resulting in the accumulation of inventory. Smaller factories are experiencing financial panic. The Japanese Textile Industry Association in China has resolved that: (1) If Japanese soldiers still do not withdraw on November 16th, they will prepare to suspend operations uniformly. (2) Before the 16th, small factories without strong capital will prepare to stop night work first. The above methods are entirely aimed at coping with our country's anti-Japanese and national salvation movement. Now, because large factories with strong capital do not agree to suspend operations immediately, the reason is that after the suspension of operations, severance pay must be paid to the workers, and it will be difficult to gather workers when operations are resumed in the future. After repeated discussions by the association, it is reported that if Japan still does not withdraw its troops on the 16th and no major incidents occur, it is planned to open as much as possible. If necessary, the method will be changed after discussion. As for the products of various factories, due to the lack of sales channels, the factory warehouses cannot be piled up, and they have been stored separately in Japanese foreign warehouses. The loss caused by this anti-Japanese boycott movement is considerable. It is reported that the various factories have been treating Chinese workers abnormally oppressively in recent days, intending to incite the Chinese workers to strike voluntarily, so that they can avoid paying severance pay. The various anti-Japanese and national salvation associations have formed a committee to discuss relief measures for the Chinese workers in Japanese textile mills, and the party and government agencies in this city have also gathered to discuss relief measures.</p>
<p>The Chinese workers of the Gongda Textile Mill, a Japanese-owned factory in Yangshupu, have recently lost their jobs. Due to the factory's announcement that it would close the entire factory around the 14th of this month, 1,200 to 1,300 of the 3,000 Chinese workers have been laid off by the factory in half a month. Some of them are patriotic and voluntarily resigned from the factory. However, more than a thousand unemployed Chinese workers are eager to make a living and are thinking of finding work in domestic factories. It is not known whether the social authorities and domestic factories are also considering how to help them make arrangements for the aftermath.</p>
<h3>Company Articles of Association Should Be Revised Within the Time Limit</h3>
<p>▲The Bureau of Social Affairs Orders to Submit Reports Within the Year</p>
<p>The Company Law and the implementation of the Company Law have been promulgated and implemented on July 1st of this year. All companies that have previously been approved for registration in accordance with the Company Ordinance, if their articles of association conflict with the Company Law, should be amended in accordance with Article 1 of the Implementing Rules of the Company Law, unless otherwise stipulated in the law, within six months after the implementation of the Company Law, and submitted to the competent authorities for reporting to the Ministry for filing. The Company Law has been in effect for several months. Many companies in this city that were previously approved for registration in accordance with the Company Ordinance have amended their articles of association in accordance with the law and submitted them to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for transfer to the Ministry of Industry for filing. However, there are still many that have not been amended. The bureau recently received an instruction from the Ministry of Industry, urging them to revise and report the articles of association within the time limit. Therefore, it has issued a notice and order to all companies to amend and report the articles of association in accordance with the law within this year, without delay.</p>
<h3>Electric Power Company Builds New Aviation Beacon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company has built a new house at No. 95 Nanjing Road, and an aviation beacon has been installed on the roof. It will be put into use within the next week. It is reported that the beacon is specially designed to facilitate nighttime aviation aircraft. It emits light 24 inches in diameter and has a firepower of 2.76 million candlepower. It can rotate automatically, once and a half times per minute. If the beacon is damaged and cannot emit light, there are excellent parts to replace the new light and reflector, which is very convenient and reliable. To be more secure, if the light cannot be emitted, the guard room will ring an alarm. Although the diameter of the light is small, the light is quite strong, so it can be seen from several miles away from the light source, and it is very beautiful and eye-catching.</p>
<h3>Mass Collection of Winter Clothing Underway</h3>
<p>▲ Collection Points Close at Month's End ▲ Limited to 200,000 Pieces</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government's Flood Relief Committee, recognizing that late autumn is drawing to a close and the harsh winter is approaching, leaving flood victims without clothing to ward off the cold, shivering in the wind, fearing that those who do not die of hunger will perish from the cold, has, in light of this, actively planned for the past two months through the Chief of the Procurement Section, Huang Renlin, and Deputy Chief, Gao Dajing. Initially, they solicited used clothing, and then established their own factories, recruiting workers to produce new clothes. Since its operation, in less than two months, in Shanghai alone, over 150,000 pieces of used clothing have been collected, and nearly 100,000 sets of new clothing have been manufactured. The committee's transportation team has already distributed these to Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and other provinces for relief. In this cold and windy weather, it is unknown how many people will be able to survive thanks to these soft and warm clothes. It is heard that the Procurement Section, considering the hard work of the various clothing collection points, plans to close the collection points at the end of this month, and within this time, will solicit an additional 50,000 pieces of used clothing from all collection points, totaling 200,000 pieces, to extend goodwill. Enclosed is a copy of the letter from the committee to the collection points: "Regarding the fact that our section has been collecting clothing for two months, we are grateful for the support of all sectors, who have enthusiastically donated. The results have been quite good. Now that late autumn is ending and the harsh winter is about to strike, how can our people bear it if they do not die from destitution? Our committee is responsible for relief, and the responsibility lies with us. Although we have successively transported 150,000 pieces of donated clothing from various parts of Shanghai to various disaster areas for relief, the disaster areas are vast and the number of refugees is too large. It is truly like a drop in the bucket. Therefore, we must work harder to thoroughly resolve the problem. Your esteemed office has received a significant number of clothing items, and not only are the recipients filled with warmth, but our committee also appreciates your kindness. Since the personnel at each collection point are mostly one or two people drawn from various groups to concurrently handle the matter, and it has been a long time, their hard work is considerable. Our section plans to close the collection points at the end of November and make a major vow during this time to collect another 50,000 pieces, totaling 200,000 pieces, to extend goodwill. Your esteemed office will not be behind others in righteousness and will surely support this initiative. We hope that you will do your best. This is our final request. Respectfully submitted, Huang Renlin, Chief of the Procurement Section, November 9."</p>

<h3>Machine Industry Association Urges Release of Detained Goods from Huachang Factory</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factories Association wrote to the Inspection Section of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association: "Respectfully informing you that the Huachang Paperboard Factory was previously detained by the Pudong Anti-Japanese Branch for cardboard and white poplar. We wrote to your esteemed association to request certification and release. Our association also sent Zi Gan, wife of [name], to inquire about the handling of the matter. We were informed that a decision to release the goods had already been made. The case has been delayed for a long time and concerns the work of all the workers at the factory. We sincerely hope that your esteemed Inspection Section will promptly release the 105 pieces of cardboard and 411 pieces of white poplar that were detained on September 29 from the Huachang Paperboard Factory, and we also hope to receive a reply."</p>
<h3>Shack Dwellers on Haig Road to be Evicted</h3>
<p>Around the eastern section of Haig Road, near Route Laborie in Western Shanghai, there are about 200 families of commoners, men, women, old and young, nearly a thousand people in total, living in makeshift grass huts. On the 6th of this month, several patrol officers from the Zhendan Road Police Station were dispatched by car to evict them, claiming that they were acting on the orders of the police station, ordering the residents of the grass huts to move out within two weeks and demolish the grass huts, and not to reside in the area, otherwise they would send people to demolish them on their behalf. Upon hearing this, the residents were all extremely alarmed and at a loss. It is found that the residents are mostly rickshaw pullers, coolies, and small business operators from Jiangbei, who have fled to Shanghai to make a living because of the continuous natural disasters and banditry in Jiangbei. Many of them have also come to Shanghai to seek refuge from the recent floods. They have been living in makeshift grass huts in the area for many years. If they are evicted without regard, they will inevitably be displaced and unable to survive. Moreover, as the weather is getting colder, their suffering will be truly unimaginable. It is hoped that the municipal authorities and various charitable organizations will provide them with strong assistance, which would be a great blessing for these vulnerable commoners.</p>

<p>Female National Physician Ye Zhen, a graduate of the Renhe Medical College and the Shanghai National Medical College, has established a clinic next to the Xiaocaishi Market in the French Concession. Last night, a grand opening ceremony was held at the Atlantic Society, with over a hundred guests from Shanghai, including fellow villagers, relatives, friends, and prominent figures from all walks of life. During the event, Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, representing the guests, delivered a speech, saying that Dr. Ye is a descendant of a long line of physicians. Instead of practicing medicine at the time, she insisted on completing Western medicine and then completing National medicine before entering the world. Now, she practices both Chinese and Western medicine, which is extremely commendable. Mr. Cai Diaotu said that it is extremely rare for a woman to have such ambition. Lawyer Wu Chengyu said that the law values evidence, and so does medicine. Dr. Ye's scholarship has been demonstrated in her graduation commemorative publication, and the evidence is sufficient for everyone to trust her with confidence. Lawyer Yang Yuan also delivered a speech. Finally, Dr. Ye Zhen spoke about the origins and development of National medicine to thank the guests for their kindness. The guests and hosts parted in joy. As for the poems, articles, and gifts sent by various sectors, they were dazzling and beautiful, truly a grand occasion.</p>

<h3>Reader's Letter</h3>
<p>A message from Mr. Lu Shifang ("A Discussion on Punishing Corruption Amid National Crisis"): "Today, people say, 'Get rich by becoming an official,' as if the shortcut to getting rich is to become an official. If an official cannot get rich, not only has he not fulfilled his duties as an official, but he has also lost the original purpose of being an official. Alas, the psychology of the Chinese people towards becoming an official is like this. Zang Aibo said, 'The failure of the state is due to the corruption of officials. The loss of virtue of officials is due to the prevalence of bribery.' Today's China, under party rule, boasts of promoting honest politics, but in reality, bribery is rampant and has become a common practice. Those who uphold integrity and fear even self-knowledge are rarely heard of. With officials being so corrupt, how can the state not fail? Moreover, in the past, when powerful figures were at the height of their power, they certainly sought power and accepted bribes, doing everything they could. But after they fell, there was still a day when their ill-gotten gains were confiscated, and people were happy. Today, those who hold power only know how to seek personal gain. Often, in just a few years, they accumulate wealth in the tens of thousands. Even if they unfortunately lose power and step down, they can take their plundered wealth on a ship abroad and enjoy a beautiful life. Not only are they beyond the reach of the country's laws, but they can also live a good life. As for the corrupt and lawless local officials, in the past, during the autocratic era, once discovered, it was difficult to escape the law. But today, even if they are reported and the evidence is conclusive, they can still use money to avoid punishment and go unpunished. After stepping down, with their abundant wealth, foreign houses, cars, fertile land, and beautiful concubines, they still retain the qualifications of a wealthy man. In such a situation, why would people not be happy to be corrupt? Why would they not prefer it? This is the case for unscrupulous people who smuggle drugs and unscrupulous merchants who privately sell enemy goods, seeking only their own benefit and not knowing shame. Are they not all affected by this kind of influence? In the past, the Song Dynasty inherited the evils of the Five Dynasties. People were accustomed to corruption, and the sense of integrity was lost. Politics was achieved through bribery, and everything was ruined. Emperor Taizu therefore strictly established laws to punish corrupt officials. Anyone who accepted bribes, no matter how much, would be executed without pardon. As a result, officials and people knew fear and slightly restrained themselves, thus regaining the moral climate. This was also the meaning of adapting to the times and using harsh punishments in troubled times. I believe that if our country wants to reverse the trend of corruption today, it should learn from the legacy of Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty in strictly punishing corrupt officials. By analogy with the regulations for punishing bandits, it should specifically formulate measures to punish corruption. Any civil servant who receives bribes or embezzles public funds, once discovered, regardless of the severity of the circumstances, in addition to confiscating the embezzled goods, should be sentenced to the maximum penalty. In this way, people will know and fear the law, and perhaps the trend of corruption can be curbed to a small extent. However, this requires the enforcers to be upright and impartial and to strictly enforce the law, so that the law is not in vain and the effect can be seen. In addition, it is especially necessary for the gentlemen of the Party and the state to promote frugality, maintain integrity, and set an example for their subordinates, so that those above will act and those below will follow. Otherwise, laws alone cannot enforce themselves. Even if we talk about eradicating corruption and rectifying officialdom every day, what good will it do? Today, the Japanese pirates are rampant, invading our Northeast. The people of our country are frightened by the disaster of national subjugation and are gathering together to try to save the situation. However, to resist foreign aggression, we must first secure the interior, and punishing corruption is the foundation of securing the interior. If corruption is not punished, there is no hope for clean politics, and we cannot talk about dealing with foreign countries. The reason is just like those who advocate hygiene, it is not enough to kill bacteria and viruses to eliminate the source of disease. This meaning is very important, so I reveal it and ask your esteemed newspaper to disclose it on my behalf to the people of the country. I hope that the people of the country will not regard it as an old saying that is irrelevant to the fight against Japan.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Public Trial of the Baoshan Road Tragedy</h3>
<p>▲ Over Two Hundred Spectators ▲ Each Defendant's Testimony of the Facts</p>
<p>▲ Private Suit Has Reached a Settlement ▲ Official Order for Plaintiff to Appear in Court</p>
<p>Following the prosecution by the local court of You Bolu and others in the Zhabei Baoshan Road tragedy, the case was scheduled for a public trial yesterday. By 8:00 AM yesterday, over two hundred spectators had arrived, crowding the First Tribunal. Court Sergeant Xu Jinqing, Detectives Chen Xihui, and Chen Wenfang, along with all the bailiffs, closely monitored and maintained order both inside and outside the courtroom. As a result, the courtroom was orderly. At 10:00 AM, the head of the criminal court, Qian Chengjun, accompanied by Judges Shen Youxi and Shen Zushou, Prosecutor Yang Wenjun, and Clerk Yu Bi, arrived in court. They immediately ordered the bailiffs to bring You Bolu, as well as police officers Lin Qingzu, Wu Maolin, Liu Weicheng, Qiao Xuechang, and Wu Zhanyou, to court. You Bolu hired lawyers Zhang Yaozeng, Sha Xunyi, and Zhu Shaowen to defend him. The victim's side hired lawyer Zhang Chongding to represent them. The presiding judge declared that the case was serious and would be heard by a collegial panel. He asked the prosecutor to state the main points of the indictment. Prosecutor Yang then stated that the defendants were jointly charged with murder, and the facts were detailed in the indictment, requesting a trial. Judge Qian then questioned:</p>
<p>You Bolu testified that he was 43 years old, from Guang'an, Sichuan, and was the district chief of the Fifth District of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, residing at 604 Kangti Road. (Question) Have you been involved in lawsuits before? (Answer) No. (Question) How many years have you worked in the Shanghai police force? (Answer) About three or four years, with a break in between. (Question) When did you become the district chief of the Fifth District? (Answer) I was appointed this time in September of the 18th year [of the Republic]. (Question) Are Lin Qingxiang and the other five police officers your Fifth District's policemen? (Answer) They are patrol officers. (Question) Were they transferred by you, or were they there before? (Answer) They were there before. (Question) What day did the incident happen? (Answer) After 6:00 PM on October 1st. (Question) What happened? (Answer) On that day, at the police booth at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road, soldiers in armored vehicles wanted to put up posters on the glass of the police booth. Patrol Officer Guo Wenman told them to put the posters elsewhere. The soldiers then cursed him as a "slave of a fallen nation" and struck the officer with a broom. The officer, in turn, became agitated and struck the soldier's hand with a baton, causing it to swell. They were then brought into the district. (Question) What were the soldiers shouting? (Answer) I've forgotten. I said that we weren't prohibiting the posting of posters, but it wasn't appropriate to put them on the glass. However, the patrol officer's violence was wrong. I said I would remove his uniform on the spot and send him to the Public Security Bureau for punishment. The soldiers said it wasn't necessary, that we should unite against external enemies, and they left satisfied. At that time, there were many workers and students watching the news at the door. (Question) What time was this? (Answer) After 6:00 PM. After the soldiers left, they announced that the matter was settled. The soldiers, fearing the public couldn't hear, stood on a confiscated rickshaw parked illegally at the door and explained the situation. The crowd dispersed, but then reassembled at 7:00 PM, with even more people gathering, numbering over a thousand. I ordered the patrol officers to go and see. (Question) Whom did you order to go and see? (Answer) Lin Qingxiang and the others, to persuade them to leave. But they wouldn't listen or disperse. Some shouted slogans, others clapped. The order was chaotic. After 8:00 PM, persuasion in any way was ineffective. (Question) Didn't you call the Public Security Bureau to ask for instructions? (Answer) It's very troublesome to call the Public Security Bureau. Because I couldn't disperse them, I went upstairs to prepare to call. At that time, Feng Xiancheng, standing committee member of the Sixth District Party, Yang Youren, executive committee member, Shi Tifen, party member, and two other party members whose names I don't know, told me that the people suspected that three Japanese had visited your district this afternoon for an hour. I explained to them the poster incident, and they said that was no longer a problem, but they were concerned about the Japanese. I said yes, one was a police officer from the consulate, and two were employees of Mitsui &amp; Co. They said Mitsui's bran had been detained on Baoshan Road and requested its return. I said it was not convenient without the Public Security Bureau's order. He wanted to go and see it, but I refused. After they left, Chief Huang of the Public Security Bureau called and told me to release it, and then sent Clerk Zhou Ding to go with my officer to see it. There were indeed over a hundred bags, but the custodian could not make a decision. So they went to the Public Security Bureau. (Question) What was the custodian's name? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) When did the Japanese come? (Answer) At 3:00 PM. I told them everything, and Yang Youren told me to explain it. I said, "Comrade Yang, I'm afraid they won't believe me." Yang said, "I can supplement your explanation." But when we got there, they immediately started scolding and shouting. Commissioner Yang told them to keep order, and I was able to explain the situation. But they continued to clamor, and Commissioner Yang tried to supplement my explanation. They then wanted to hit Commissioner Yang. (Question) How did they disperse? (Answer) At 8:30 PM, two warning shots were fired, and they dispersed. (Question) Did you order the shots to be fired? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Whom did you order to fire the shots? (Answer) Liu Weicheng and the others. (Question) What kind of gun? (Answer) A Mauser pistol. However, before the shots were fired, public buses were passing by, and we heard shouts for help, so two patrol officers went to rescue them. The shouting became more intense, mixed with the voices of women. If I had been killed for the public good, it would have been fine. But because of the scandalous situation, it was affecting foreign relations, and they also wanted to seize the officers' guns. Therefore, I ordered Liu Weicheng to fire. After the crowd dispersed, two dead people were found on the ground. It was impossible to know who had killed them. But we have Mauser pistols, and the bullets we received are numbered. We found handgun bullets on the ground. We fired a total of eight shots. (Question) Then, since bullets were fired, they were not warning shots? (Answer) We fired upwards, not horizontally. We also called the Sixth Squad, but they didn't arrive until after the incident. I asked them why they were so late, and they said that the road in front of the Commercial Press was crowded and they couldn't get through.</p>
<p>Lin Qingxiang testified that he was 30 years old, from Pingyin, Shandong, a third-class police officer in the Fifth District, and lived in the district. He had never been involved in lawsuits before. (Question) How many years have you been a policeman? (Answer) More than two years. I arrived during the previous district chief's term. (Question) When did the previous incident happen? (Answer) 8:30 on the 1st. (Question) The incident, you mean the time the shots were fired? (Answer) Yes. (Question) How many shots did you fire? (Answer) Two shots. (Question) You mean the five of you? (Answer) Yes. (Question) You fired yourselves? (Answer) The district chief ordered us to. (Question) You fired real bullets? (Answer) To fire real bullets, one shot is enough to kill four or five people. I fired upwards. (Question) What kind of gun did you fire? (Answer) A box gun. (Question) That's a Mauser pistol? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Warning shots shouldn't kill people, and five people were injured. (Answer) There were too many people, it's hard to say. I don't know who killed them. (Question) Why did you have to fire? (Answer) They wanted to seize my gun, I had no choice. (Question) What would they do with the gun? (Answer) To hit us. (Question) Why did they want to hit you?

<h3>Kidnappers Rejoice Prematurely, All Plans Fail</h3>
<p>▲ Zhang Longzao's Grandson Not Kidnapped</p>
<p>▲ Kidnappers Had Meticulous Plans ▲ The Steps Were Well-Arranged</p>
<p>▲ But Detectives Uncovered Everything ▲ Ill-Gotten Gains Go Awry</p>
<p>The name of the physician Zhang Longzao is known to all. Although he passed away many years ago, his descendants have carried on his legacy, maintaining the Zhang Longzao name. His original name, Zhang Ruoxing (style name Zhusan), is not well-known to patients. Because the Zhang family has three generations of famous doctors, they are considered wealthy, attracting the attention of criminals. A certain kidnapping ringleader recently planned to kidnap Zhang Xingruo. Half a month ago, he gathered his accomplices, changed their names, and repeatedly visited the Zhongnan Hongxiang Hotel and other hotels on Xinza Road and Avenue Edward VII, claiming to be travelers and secretly held meetings in rented rooms. Until the morning before yesterday, they finalized their plan in room 20 of the Hongxiang Hotel.</p>
<p>The plan was set to proceed at 3:00 PM that afternoon. Wang Ali, Zhu Asi, and A'er were sent out to rent a car under the pretense of picking up students. They were to trick the driver into driving to the front of the Yangcun School near Hongqiao Road and Zhongshan Road in the western part of the Shanghai International Settlement. They would then subdue the driver with violence. Zhang Amao, who had experience driving cars, was assigned to ride a bicycle to the riverside near the school. After Wang and the others secured the driver, he would drive the car quickly to Pingqiao Road and stop in front of Dr. Zhang's house. At 3:30 PM, several kidnappers would depart from the Hongxiang Hotel, rush to Zhang's house, and abduct Zhang, carrying him away in the car parked in front.</p>
<p>They estimated that the hostage would be in their hands by 4:00 PM. Therefore, Wang Ali and the others were instructed to keep the driver under surveillance until sunset before releasing him. The plan was well-laid out and considered every aspect. After the assignments were completed, the kidnappers believed they could easily succeed. Everyone followed orders diligently. After noon, Zhang Amao rented a bicycle and set off towards the designated location. Following him were Wang Ali, Zhu Asi, and A'er, acting according to the kidnapping ringleader's strategy. They went to the Dongxin Motor Company on Haig Road and rented a car, number 12419, claiming to be picking up students returning home from the western suburbs of Shanghai. After the driver Shi Zhenxiang and the three kidnappers got into the car, they gave instructions, and Shi drove. When they reached the opposite side of Yangcun School, they ordered the car to stop. The area was unusually desolate,</p>
<p>with reeds growing densely, resembling a green gauze curtain. A kidnapper suddenly drew a pistol from his sleeve and ordered Shi not to make a sound. The others took out pre-hidden ropes, cloth, and other items to tightly bind Shi's hands and feet and gag his mouth. Then they dragged him to the dense reeds to hide. The three kidnappers surrounded and watched him with weapons. Shi, completely unable to resist, could only submit to their control. Zhang Amao, who was lingering on the riverbank, saw that the initial plan had succeeded, abandoned his bicycle, jumped into the car, and drove to Zhang's house on Pingqiao Road, where he waited for about four quarters of an hour. Not only did he not see his accomplices come to kidnap Dr. Zhang,</p>
<p>but instead, a large group of detectives arrived. While he hesitated, the detectives surrounded him and asked if he had a driver's license. Zhang could not answer and was arrested. It turned out that the plan they had decided on at the Hongxiang Hotel had been entirely uncovered by Detective Pi Shaochang of the Gordon Road Police Station. Since the criminals had agreed to start at 3:00 PM, Detective Pi reported to the chief, who dispatched Chinese Detective Chief Shen Chongli, Detectives Liu Chunshu, Zhang Liang, Detective Li Wenhan, and Western Detective Crowther to secretly go to the hotel at 2:30 PM. They arrested Yu Changyou (aka Wang Changgui), Li Aqi, Wang Depu, and Zhang Juxian, who was about to enter the room, in room number two. Upon searching them, they found three pistols, twenty-four bullets, and a letter addressed to Dr. Zhang's family,</p>
<p>demanding ransom. This letter was originally intended to be mailed after Dr. Zhang was taken to the criminals' den. It was also taken to the police station. After the criminals confessed their plans, the detectives went to the vicinity of Zhang's house to arrest the criminal driving the car. At first, they did not know that Zhang Amao was an accomplice. After questioning him and learning that he did not have a driver's license, they became suspicious and arrested him. The criminal confessed on the spot and also revealed that Wang Ali and the others were still monitoring the driver, Shi Zhenxiang, near Yangcun School. The Chinese and Western detectives immediately reported to the Sixth District Police Station for assistance. The district chief dispatched more detectives to the address. When they arrived, A'er was saying to Wang and Zhu,</p>
<p>"It should be done by now. You two can go back first. Give the pistol to me, and I will watch this driver a little longer and then let him go." While speaking, he accepted the pistol from Wang and the others. Then, turning around, he saw a large group of detectives swarming over. Without informing Wang and Zhu, he grabbed the gun, jumped on a bicycle, and fled like a whirlwind. The detectives chased him for a while, but he escaped because the bicycle was too fast. Wang Ali was captured on the spot. Zhu Asi hid among the desolate graves. At this time, there was a sudden gunshot. The detectives believed that Zhu had fired to resist arrest. Western Detective Crowther also fired a shot, and Chinese Detective Zhang Liang</p>
<p>fired six shots in succession, wounding Zhu in the left shoulder and right arm. Only then did the criminal surrender. Because his arm injury was quite serious and the bullet had not passed through, he was sent to the hospital for treatment. Wang was temporarily detained at the local police station, awaiting a warrant from the court. Shi Zhenxiang, who was hiding in the bushes, was untied by the detectives and taken to Pingqiao Road, where he was allowed to drive the original car back. Later, three more criminals, Li Mengfei, Chen Hongsheng, and Wang Zhifang, were arrested at the front and back doors of the Hongxiang Hotel. Together with the five previously arrested, they were all escorted to the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning. Judge Feng Shide interrogated them. Police station lawyer Wang Yaotang requested that the criminals be prosecuted under the Law for the Punishment of Kidnappers. However, as further investigation was needed, he requested a postponement. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the details of the case. Judge Feng briefly questioned each defendant about their name, age, and place of origin, and then ordered them all to be detained, pending further investigation and the extradition of Wang Ali for further inquiry at a later date.</p>
<h3>Shooting and Fighting During an Arrest on Avenue Foch</h3>
<p>▲ A Cigarette Paper Store Coveted by Criminals ▲ Lights Turned Off, No Way to Start ▲ Gunfire Frequent on the Market Road ▲ One Thief Captured on the Spot</p>
<p>Around 11 PM last night, a shooting and fighting incident occurred on Avenue Foch in the French Concession during the arrest of a group of thieves. Gunfire was frequent in the Marche Road area, resulting in the capture of one injured thief and the escape of three others. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Four Well-Dressed Thieves Local resident Xu Juliang operated the Yong Sheng Chang cigarette paper store at numbers 33-35 Avenue Foch in the French Concession. The business was thriving, attracting the attention of criminals. Around 11 PM last night, four well-dressed thieves, speaking with a Ningbo accent, suddenly entered the store under the pretense of buying items. They all drew pistols, warning everyone to be silent.</p>
<p>▲ Lights Off, Thieves Scatter As the thieves were about to begin their search, a particularly alert employee secretly went to the corner of the room and flipped the light switch, plunging the entire store into darkness. The thieves panicked and rushed out of the store, fleeing westward. At the same time, police whistles sounded, and a chase ensued. The thieves became even more flustered and turned back to fire.</p>
<p>▲ Falls to the Ground and Surrenders As the gunfire erupted, Inspector Jin Jiulin, Detective Li Yaolong, Assistant Detectives Jin Jinzhen and Zhang Zitai, Qian Yumin, and Constable Xue Youlin of the French Police Station were patrolling nearby. They drew their guns and returned fire. Vietnamese Constable number 310 also joined in, firing from a distance with a rifle. Immediately, gunfire erupted on Marche Road, and stray bullets flew everywhere. Pedestrians scattered in all directions. In the end, three thieves escaped, while one was hit by four bullets in both legs, fell to the ground in pain, and surrendered.</p>
<p>▲ More Than Ten Shots Fired by Both Sides After being captured, the thief had a loaded pistol seized from him, containing five bullets. He and the gun were taken to the police station. After being questioned by the police chief, the thief identified himself as Jiang Zuwei, 26 years old, from Ningbo, and admitted to organizing the robbery. Inspector Jin then reported the situation, stating that the thief had fired four shots, Vietnamese Constable number 310 had fired four shots, and Constable Jiang Youlin had fired five shots before capturing the thief.</p>
<h3>Xu Yabo Escorted to Songjiang</h3>
<p>▲ Xu's Appearance Extremely Wretched ▲ Unkempt Hair, Dirty Face, Blue Prison Uniform</p>
<p>Former Chief of the First District of the Jiangsu Water Police, Xu Yabo, resided at number 332 Avenue Foch after leaving office. Due to his teacher-student relationship with the Taihu bandit leader Taibao Ashu (aka Xu Tianxiong), who was executed this summer, Xu Yabo came under close scrutiny after Ashu was captured in Shanghai by the current Chief of the First District Water Police, Xu Pucheng. It was subsequently discovered that Xu Yabo was suspected of instigating and directing the gang robbery of a rice store opened by Xu Baimin in Songjiang. The relevant police station was requested to assist in arresting Xu and searching his residence, where a pistol and six bullets were found. The pistol only had a permit from the French Police Station, but even that permit was about to expire. A forged brigade commander insignia and a passbook for the Minghua Bank with a deposit of 10,500 yuan were also confiscated. Additionally, 25 yuan in banknotes and two British pounds were found on his person. He was handed over to the First Special District Local Court, which ordered him to be transferred to the Songjiang County Court for trial. However, Xu refused to accept the decision and repeatedly appealed, so he remained in custody at the police station for nearly half a year. Now that the decision has been finalized, the police station escorted Xu back to the court yesterday morning. Xu was wearing a blue prison uniform, with unkempt hair and a dirty face, looking nothing like his former self. The Songjiang County Court dispatched bailiffs to the court to take custody of him. Chief Xu Pucheng also came to the court in person, requesting that the forged insignia be taken along for further investigation. Police station lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the firearms had no permits and should be confiscated. He also requested instructions on how to dispose of the deposits and other items. Judge Feng ordered Xu Yabo and the forged insignia to be handed over to the bailiffs from the Songjiang County Court to be taken back for trial. The pistol, bullets, and passbook were temporarily stored in the vault pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Filed by Deceived Employees After the Closure of Sino-American Banking Corporation</h3>
<p>▲Victims Number Forty to Fifty</p>
<p>▲Fraudulent Funds Amount to Approximately Fifty Thousand</p>
<p>▲A Female Employee Files the First Complaint</p>
<p>▲Most of the Defendants Have Gone into Hiding</p>
<p>Ma Zhichao, Li Henian, Li Yaoguang, Cheng Chunlin, and others, formerly established the Sino-American Banking Corporation at No. 13 Guangdong Road, published advertisements in various newspapers to recruit employees, and issued high-interest dividend certificates, etc. Because they failed to legally register with the competent authorities, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau discovered the matter and issued an order to prohibit such illegal organizations. The company then suspended operations. However, before the prohibition, the company had already received a considerable amount of security deposits from its employees, which it failed to handle afterward. Therefore, Wu Shiying, a former female employee of the Sino-American Banking Corporation residing at No. 11 Chongde Lane, Luban Road, in the French Concession, and Lin Zhijie, also an employee of the company residing at No. 376 Houfu Lane, Da Tiebang, jointly filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing them of jointly establishing an illegal company under false pretenses and fraudulently obtaining property. The indictment stated that the defendants, using illegal fraudulent means, established the Sino-American Banking Corporation at No. 13 Guangdong Road without registering with the competent authorities in accordance with legal procedures and commenced operations. They also used newspaper advertisements to promote and absorb a large amount of deposits, and under the guise of recruiting employees, used generous benefits as bait to collect security deposits from employees. Before three months had passed, they suddenly came up with a whimsical idea and published advertisements to solicit the issuance of high-interest dividend certificates, hoping to fraudulently obtain a large amount of cash. Fortunately, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau discovered the matter and issued a notice prohibiting it. The company's cunning scheme failed, and it suddenly declared a temporary suspension of business on October 28th, claiming that the registration meeting was misunderstood (see the company's suspension notice in front of the door), which affected business. The defendants also went into hiding the next day. The plaintiffs, who were recruited and hired and each paid a security deposit of 1,000 yuan to become employees of the company, realized the defendants were engaging in fraudulent activities. They investigated the addresses of the defendants and reported them to the police. The police dispatched detectives to arrest the second and third defendants, while the first and fourth defendants had already escaped. The second defendant confessed to the police, falsely claiming that he was also an employee. The third defendant said that he was an American and also an employee. The police immediately released them and instructed the plaintiffs to file a lawsuit directly with the court, and the police were willing to be witnesses. Therefore, in addition to being punished according to law, they requested that the security deposits they paid be returned. This case was heard yesterday afternoon in the Sixth Criminal Court by Judge Jiang Gongliang. First, the plaintiff Wu Shiying testified that she was 21 years old. The defendants published advertisements to recruit employees, and she went to take the exam and was hired. She paid 540 yuan in cash and 400 yuan in shares, with an agreed monthly salary of 60 yuan. However, after the company closed, not only was her salary not paid, but also her security deposit was not returned, so she accused them of fraud. Next, Lin Zhijie was summoned, and his testimony was roughly the same. The security deposit he paid was also 1,000 yuan, but his monthly salary was 40 yuan, totaling 1,040 yuan. The Chinese constable No. 1281 Jin Wanxiong said that the defendants' addresses had changed, and the summons could not be delivered. Then, the plaintiff's attorney, Tang Huaiqun, said that since accepting the plaintiff's commission, there were still forty or fifty victims, amounting to about 50,000 yuan, who had come to entrust him with the matter. However, they had not arrived today because they did not have time to fill out the commission forms. However, the defendants had already gone into hiding, and the summons would definitely not be delivered. He requested that a warrant be issued for their arrest. Judge Jiang verified the testimony and ordered that the defendants be brought to court and set the hearing for next Wednesday.</p>
<p>In addition, the creditors of the Sino-American Banking Corporation held a meeting at the Jintai Hotel the day before yesterday afternoon and resolved (1) to elect Huang Cunsen, Shen Julin, and Lu Bingzhang as the general and deputy representatives to be fully responsible for handling all matters of the creditors' group, (2) to first publish a warning to the persons in charge of the company, requiring them to come to the office of the group within five days to clarify the matter, and to pursue legal action if they exceed the deadline. It was also learned that after the two persons related to the company, Li Hongsen and Li Yaoguang, were arrested, the plaintiff's side had asked lawyer Tang Huaiqun to draft an indictment.</p>
<h3>Record of the Trial of Four Kidnappers Subsequently Arrested in the Lu Shaotang Case</h3>
<p>▲Police Present Testimonial and Material Evidence</p>
<p>▲Detailed Presentation in Seven Items</p>
<p>▲Additional Indictment for the Murder of a Russian</p>
<p>▲Court to Summon Lu for Testimony Next Time</p>
<p>The kidnappers Liang Tingdong (i.e., Liang Dexiu), Li Changyuan, Sun Jinsheng (i.e., Jin Yazhe), a woman Jin Lishi (Li Changyuan's sister and Sun Jinsheng's daughter), and Sun Lishi (Li Changyuan's sister) conspired on December 18th of last year to kidnap Lu Shaotang, a comprador of the Fair Ocean Company, on Yunnan Road for ransom. After the crime was discovered, they fled to Tianjin. Recently, the Tianjin Public Security Bureau arrested Liang and others. Lu Liankui, the chief Chinese detective of the General Inspectorate of the Shanghai General Inspectorate, sent Chinese detective Tang Jian to Tianjin to escort them back. Liang knew that he would surely die and hanged himself in the Tianjin prison. Detective Tang then brought the four men and women, including Li, to Shanghai and handed them over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. As detailed in this newspaper, yesterday morning, Criminal Court Judge Xu Jiashi opened the First Criminal Court to continue the trial. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that after the Lu case was solved by the police, it was discovered that No. 414 Lafayette Road, No. 374 Hede Road, and No. 55 Oujia Road were all important organs of the gang, and Room 51 of the Dadong Hotel was the meeting place. Now the police have many testimonial and material evidence that can prove that the four defendants in this case have a close relationship with these four places. (1) The police found a wedding photo in the home of Shuai Songping at No. 414 Lafayette Road. The defendant Sun Jinsheng is one of the groomsmen. The photo was also given to Sun Jinsheng, but it has not been sent out. The photo is inscribed with the words "In memory of brother Jinsheng," which shows a very deep relationship with Shuai. (2) Inside No. 55 Oujia Road, photos of Li Changyuan, Sun Lishi, and two small photos of the executed criminal Wang Sanhuai and Sun Jinsheng in theatrical costumes were found. (3) The Fourth Detachment of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau arrested the defendants and found that they were the main criminals who kidnapped Lu Shaotang. They then made a report to the General Bureau. The report was copied by the police and is an important piece of evidence in this case. (4) Liang Tingdong confessed in two confession slips from the Tianjin Public Security Bureau and the Tianjin British Engineering Bureau that Li Changyuan and Sun Jinsheng were both involved in the Lu case, and Jin Lishi and Sun Lishi had also seen the hostage for a few days. (5) Li Changyuan, Sun Jinsheng, Jin Lishi, and Sun Lishi all wrote two confession slips each at the Tianjin Public Security Bureau and the Tianjin British Engineering Bureau. Li confessed to carrying out the kidnapping at the time, Sun confessed to driving the car, and the two women confessed to guarding the hostage. Sun Lishi also confessed to delivering a pistol. (6) Li and others also wrote confession slips in Shanghai, but they were very different from the confession slips in Tianjin, with many evasive words. (7) A Chevrolet car with license plate number 10362 was used to kidnap Lu Shaotang and was ordered by the court to be confiscated. The car was placed at No. 115 Zhoujiazui Road. Now there are Chen Shaoxiong and others who can prove that the room rent for the car was paid by Sun Jinsheng, and the car was also driven by Sun. With such evidence, the police filed a lawsuit in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Law on Punishing Kidnappers. Also, because the bodyguard of Lu Shaotang, a Russian named Mao Distaidu, was shot and killed by the bandits at the scene, the police also filed an additional indictment in accordance with Articles 371 and 282 of the Criminal Law, requesting severe punishment according to law. The above-mentioned material evidence was then presented to the court. Then, Chen Shaoxiong testified that the rent for the garage at No. 115 Zhoujiazui Road was paid by Sun Jinsheng, and the car was also driven by Sun. Lu Guisheng and Li Agui, the chauffeurs of Lu Shaotang, also turned themselves in and testified that when the boss was kidnapped, the car used by the bandits to take the boss away was the confiscated Chevrolet car with license plate number 10362. When questioned, Li Changyuan confessed that he lived at No. 55 Oujia Road. Although he had been to No. 51 Dadong, he did not know about the meeting to discuss the kidnapping. However, they had ordered him to buy cotton quilts and send them to No. 374 Hede Road. Sun Jinsheng confessed that he was introduced by Liang Tingdong to Shuai Songping to work as a driver, driving car number 10362. At the same time, Shuai also had two other cars, numbers 10727 and 10424. He knew nothing about the kidnapping. On the day Lu Shaotang was kidnapped, Shuai ordered him to switch drivers with the driver of car number 10727 because he was not skilled in driving, so he did not know anything about it. Jin Lishi and Sun Lishi both denied guarding the hostage. Judge Xu Jiashi verified the testimony and ordered that the case be adjourned for two weeks because Lu Shaotang still needed to be summoned to testify.</p>
<h3>Further Trial of Kidnappers in the Wei Tingrong Case</h3>
<p>Wei Tingrong, the former commander of the French Concession Chinese Volunteer Corps and manager of the Sino-French Bank, was kidnapped on July 24th of the 18th year of the Republic of China at around 10:00 AM on Zhu Baosan Road in the French Concession. When he got into his car with his children to go home, he was suddenly abducted by kidnappers. The car drove to Xinkai River, where the bandits forced Wei's children out of the car, and then applied anesthetic drugs, rendering Wei unconscious. They then went by boat to Dongjiadu in the South City and hid him in Liuzao, Pudong, demanding a huge ransom. They negotiated the release of the hostage in Hangzhou and other places. After the French police conducted a thorough investigation for about two months, the bandits abandoned the hostage and fled. Wei was finally released, and the police arrested the kidnappers Chen Zhongheng, also known as Wang Kui, Zhu Jingcheng, also known as Zhu Fengxiang, and Tang Shiliang. After interrogation by the former French Public Conrt, Chen and others confessed that they were the main culprits, and others were at large. Chen and others were sentenced to imprisonment. This summer, in July, the police arrested Cai Weicai, a key criminal in this case from Pudong, who confessed that Lü Ruowang from Shaoxing was involved. They also went to Hangzhou and arrested Lü, who confessed that Zhao Weixian, Wei's brother-in-law, instigated and conspired to kidnap Wei. The police then dispatched detectives and family members of the victim to Suzhou and arrested Zhao and brought him to Shanghai, where he was sent to the Second Special District Local Court. The police filed a lawsuit according to law, and the court ordered that the case be investigated further. Yesterday was another scheduled continuation of the trial. At 2:00 PM, the police escorted the defendants to the First Court, where Judge Luo Renji, accompanied by clerk Tao Zongkan, opened the court and briefly questioned the defendants about their age, origin, and occupation, and then announced that the trial would be continued on a scheduled date. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Youth Association Western Restaurant Launches Game Meats</h3>
<p>The Youth Association Western Restaurant, with its exquisite cuisine and low prices, has long been praised by all walks of life. Now that winter has arrived, the restaurant has specially dispatched people to various rural areas to collect game meats, hunting rare birds and animals, all of which are processed and cooked by famous chefs who have studied in Europe for many years. The flavors are fresh and delicious, and the dishes are changed daily to satisfy the palates of the diners, while the prices remain the same as before and are not increased. Therefore, more Chinese and Westerners are hosting banquets and meals there than before. Other imitation European and American snacks and candies are also popular with the public and are known for their quality and low prices.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the representatives of the Shanghai Gordon Road Peace and Unity Conference, Mr. Hu Hanmin of Maierxi Road, and all newspaper offices: We have recently read the so-called Jiang Su Province Party Members' Telegram to Mr. Wang Jingwei and Mr. Cai Jiemin etc., listed the names of Party Members etc, in the Shen and Xin newspapers on the 4th of this month. We were neither asked for permission beforehand, nor do we know where this telegram came from afterwards. It is conceivable that it was fabricated by a small number of people. Moreover, upon examining the wording, it is purely an attack on Mr. Hu Hanmin personally. The Party Members believe that at a time when foreign troubles are pressing and internal worries are increasing, the whole country is seeking sincere unity to save this critical and precarious nation. As Party Members, we should be impartial and selfless, and work together to overcome the difficulties. If we only think of personal rights and status, and do not hesitate to use the tricks of ghosts and goblins to sow discord, hoping to undermine the peace conference, we are accelerating the demise of the nation and willingly disregarding the fate of a subjugated people. We respectfully express our private thoughts and ask for your public consideration. Respectfully submitted by Xu Qihua and Li Shouzhi, members of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, We have read the news item "Turbulence Caused by Anti-Japanese Inspectors at Ningbo Port" in the "News from Maritime Circles" column of your newspaper on the 7th of this month, which stated, "Two inspectors from the anti-Japanese society escaped into the China Merchants Bureau, and the bureau members hid the two men and locked the iron gate, which aroused public outrage." After reading it, we were very surprised. After investigation, none of the bureau members hid the inspectors. After further investigation, at 1:00 PM that afternoon, the police escorted the two inspectors to the Public Security Bureau. When they passed the Hejia Lane entrance on the south side of the bureau, they were again rushed back by the crowd. The inspectors took the opportunity to escape into the bureau gate to hide. The crowd followed closely, like a tide. At that time, Yang, the police chief of the Second District, led the police on the scene. Fearing a major disaster, he temporarily closed the bureau gate to restrict the entry and exit of onlookers. On the one hand, the Public Security Bureau transferred the security team and took the two inspectors away. The bureau gate was immediately opened as usual. The crowd did not have any ill feelings towards the bureau. We think that your reporter's rumors are untrue. Therefore, we ask you to make corrections on our behalf, or to publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to clarify the truth. Respectfully submitted to the Editor of the Shen Bao, Ningbo Branch of the General Administration Office of the China Merchants Bureau under the National Government, November 9, 1931.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I have read the article "Young Man in Western Suit Engages in Fraudulent Activities" on the third page of your newspaper on October 29th. It describes the fraudulent activities of the young man in Western suit, Wang Yonghai. After being arrested, he confessed that he was 21 years old and from Shandong. His cousin, Liu Chao, is now the captain of the Fifth Aviation Squadron in Nanjing, and he has a friend named Chen who holds an important position at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Station. After reading this, I was very surprised. I am originally from Shandong, but I do not know who Wang Yonghai is. I have no connection or acquaintance with him. His claim that he is related to me is pure nonsense. Perhaps he has heard my name somewhere, but it is not known. This matter is related to my reputation. Therefore, I am sending this letter specifically to clarify and ask your newspaper to publish a correction to clarify the truth. Respectfully submitted, Liu Chao, November 4th.</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor of the Shen Bao, Dear Sir, In yesterday's local news column of your newspaper, there was a section on the "Yuan Da and Other Metal Shops' Inspection of Japanese Goods." It stated, "Zhu Lide beat the inspectors" and falsely reported it to the police, saying that it was a robbery. This is not consistent with the facts. We respectfully request that you make a correction. We would be most grateful. Respectfully, Zhu Lide.</p>

<h3>Recollections of Dailiang</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>▲Japanese Don't Recognize Huang Tai Xuan</p>
<p>The Japanese claim to be the leaders of East Asian art. They promote Hashimoto Kansetsu as the giant of the painting world. The court and the public value him. However, they rarely approve of Chinese painters. Only Wu Changshuo, Wang Yiting, Qian Shoutie, etc., are admired. The families of the gentry and merchants all hang three-foot paintings. Even the poor who cannot afford to buy three-foot originals hang lithographs on the wall to show their elegance. The price of Wu's paintings increased repeatedly before his death, which is why. Wang's annual income from his inkstone field reached more than 20,000 gold yuan, half of which came from the Japanese. Qian's frequent trips to Japan were also to earn Japanese money. Last autumn, Qian returned from a trip to Huangshan Mountain. A Japanese merchant, Tsuchiya, offered 400 gold yuan for Qian to paint a Huangshan Mountain picture on a six-panel screen. Qian's friend, Huang Taixuan, wrote a long poem for it. When it was shown to Tsuchiya, he was very displeased. Qian changed another one for him. The next day, Tsuchiya came again. Qian showed him the screen and said, "Fortunately, I have not failed you. I have changed one." Tsuchiya changed his expression and thanked him, saying, "I didn't know Mr. Huang before. Now I know that he is the one who wrote the preface for Hashimoto Kansetsu. May I have it as well?" Qian smiled slightly and said, "Mr. Huang is a stubborn man. He tore it off when he heard that you disliked it." Tsuchiya asked again and again, so he gave a hundred gold yuan and took the painting away with joy. Those who heard about it laughed at Tsuchiya's arrogance and deference and used Kansetsu as a refuge.</p>

<h3>The Mother of Thought</h3>
<p>Action is the mother of thought. Science is played out from tricks.</p>
<p>Mr. Dewey listed the following steps in the process of analyzing and reflecting on thoughts: (1) feeling of difficulty; (2) ascertaining the location of the difficulty; (3) trying to solve it; (4) choosing the most effective method to try among many methods; (5) drawing conclusions after repeated trials. This process of reflective thought is the process of scientific thought.</p>
<p>I have experienced Mr. Dewey's principles for more than ten years, and I feel that the process he described is like a unipolar circuit, which cannot conduct current. He did not mention the mother of thought. This mother is action. There is difficulty only when the road is blocked. It is a common person who does not feel the difficulty when the road is blocked. It is a scientist who creates thousands of difficulties and solutions in his heart without even moving his feet. Therefore, the correction I want to propose is to add an action step before the difficulty. Thus, the entire process of scientific life becomes: action creates difficulty; difficulty creates doubt; doubt creates hypothesis; hypothesis creates experiment; experiment creates conclusion; conclusion creates action, and so on, evolving infinitely. If you are too lazy to do it, how can correct thoughts be produced, and how can you be considered a scientific life?</p>

<h3>World News Snippets</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>▲Tracking Columbus' Good Man. At the end of nineteen hundred and thirty one. There will be an amazing feat in the maritime world. Attracting worldwide attention. It turns out that someone is preparing to take a replica of that year. Columbus' famous "Santa Maria" that discovered the New World of America. "Santa Maria" across the Atlantic. The initiator of this is an officer in the Spanish Navy, Captain Don Julio Guillen. He started two years ago. They are building a new ship modeled after Columbus' "Santa Maria". Prepared to be displayed in the Seville Exhibition. He now intends to take this ship. Cross the Atlantic. And follow the old method of navigation of Columbus in 1492. Do not use all new machines and new equipment. This is the commendable point. It really can track Columbus. In recent years. Although people often take risks at sea. The ships they use. Maybe it's smaller than this "Santa Maria" copy. But they all adopted new navigation methods. After all, the old method is easier. Now, Mr. Ganlang is preparing. We sincerely wish him success on this trip.</p>
<h3>Habit Recording</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yan</p>
<p>An old man in Yangzhou had a cleanliness obsession. He had to take a bath once a day. However, he was stingy and greedy. After each bath. He had to hide a hemp cloth towel in his sleeve and return. (In the early years, the bathhouse used hemp towels. In recent years, they have been changed to towels.) The shop assistant suspected for a long time. So he paid attention to investigation. Only then did he know that it was the old man who did it. Because he thought he was an old customer. And because the old man's son was noble and prominent. It was inconvenient to expose the truth. So he complained to the old man's son. The old man's son was magnanimous. Nor did he blame the old man for what he did. So he admitted to paying the value of the towel every day. The old man then boldly stole the towels for decades. Thinking he had succeeded. He was happy every day. After the old man died. Dozens of boxes of towels were found. Because they were hidden in secret when they were wet. They have been rotten and unusable. Unable to make filial clothing. Nor can it be used as a rag.</p>
<p>During the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods. There were many famous calligraphers and painters in Yangzhou. Such as Zheng Banqiao, Luo Liangfeng, Li Futang, Jin Nong, and Hua Xinluo. (Although Luo, Li, Jin, etc. were not from Yangzhou. But they stayed in Yangzhou for a long time.) All of them became famous in Yangzhou. Because at that time, salt merchants were wealthy. They had the hobbies of prostitutes and concubines. Therefore, elegant scholars were willing to stay and linger. In the middle of the Guangxu period. There were two famous painters, Wang Su and Chen Chongguang. Wang Zong Xinluo. Chen Zong Laolian. Chen was too wild in his later years. The paintings are often not in accordance with the rules. I heard that he must stand infatuated in front of the door every night when he returned home. He kept painting on the door with his fingers.</p>
<p>When my house used to be in Beihe Xia, Yangzhou. There was an old woman surnamed Li. She was in her seventies. She was alone. Her hair was already bare. She still wore a small bun the size of a silver dollar. She had to wear several fresh flowers every day. Her face was painted with powder like Cao Cao. Male and female servants. Abandoned and unused. Only employ twelve or thirteen year old boys. Called him a true boy and did not eat water carried by strong men. Every day, the boy carried water from the river to boil for drinking. The strangest thing is. Only keep half of the water to drink. And the other half of the water is not used or drunk. Said that he was afraid of the smell of farts. I hate being dirty and unclean.</p>
<h3>The Old Pomelo Tree Shaped Like a Dragon</h3>
<p>— Wind Dance</p>
<p>Qiongya is a remote place in the southwest of Guangdong, an island diagonally opposite Hepu. Emperor Bing of the Song Dynasty fled to Qiongya due to the Yuan army's persecution. Lu Xiufu carried him and jumped into the sea, which was now four or five hundred years ago. The coast opposite Qiongya is where they jumped into the sea. Next to it is a pomelo tree (i.e., a Wentan tree). The main trunk is entwined with a large dragon shape. The large and small branches are all like this. People think the texture of the bark is like this, but when the bark is peeled off, small dragon shapes still appear clearly in the branches. It is quite puzzling. According to legend, when the Song Emperor went to his death in the sea, he took off his royal robe and hung it on this tree. Could it be that this pomelo tree received the upright energy of heaven and earth and remained for future generations to admire? When I was a guest in that place, I saw it with my own eyes. I paid fifteen yuan to the tree owner to buy a small pomelo branch and made it into a cigarette holder. The small dragon looked lifelike and was extremely exquisite. It is a pity that it was stolen by a thief when I brought it to Hong Kong. Even now, thinking about it, I still have regrets. Readers may doubt my words? Then the tree is still thriving and bears fruit that is unusually large compared to ordinary pomelos. If you inquire with people from Qiongya, you will know that my words are not false. According to the locals, the fruit produced by this tree is refreshing and fragrant, and each pair is worth three to four yuan. It is a pity that it was late spring, and I could not taste it. That is also a pity.</p>
<h3>New Talk on Records</h3>
<p>— Zhurongshi</p>
<p>Recently, record companies have sprung up like mushrooms, becoming increasingly prosperous. Each is trying to outdo the other, competing to gather famous performers and collect excellent sounds, hoping to dominate the record industry. Therefore, new records are released endlessly. The Greater China Record Company has always been a leader among record companies in Shanghai. Recently, it has released newly recorded excellent records to the public. Among them, the most popular are Thirteen Sister Persuading Marriage from Hibiscus Grass, Daughter's Lessons from "An Accidental Reunion," and "Beaded Curtain Village," a duet with Yang Baosen. Hibiscus Grass has long enjoyed a great reputation, and many people in Shanghai have praised her. Recently, with the assistance of Hui Sheng, there is a wonderful harmony. Among female dan roles, besides the four famous dan of Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Shang Xiaoyun, and Xun Huisheng, she is directly regarded as the best. Her articulation is clear, and her acting is meticulous, unparalleled. The Thirteen Sister Persuading Marriage section is Zhang Jinfeng persuading Thirteen Sister to marry in "The Romance of the Bow and Inkstone." It is a long monologue. In dramas, monologues are more difficult than singing. Hibiscus Grass can complete it in one breath without showing any signs of exhaustion. Her voice is not high but bright, and her words are clear and correct, like pearls rolling on a jade plate, pouring down. Compared to Yanqiu, she is not much inferior. Daughter's Lessons from "An Accidental Reunion" is a work that emphasizes both singing and monologue. Xiao Yun, when performing this, plays this role, not pretending to be Di Nu, and thus has the reputation of turning the guest into the host. Now that Hibiscus Grass plays this, if not matched with Hui Sheng, it would also be like Xiao Yun. The opening lyrics are very similar to Hui Sheng. In between, the monologue is even more crisp than persuading marriage, like slicing pears, making people feel fascinated. Baosen has been in hiding for a long time due to his voice problems. Now that he has recovered his voice, he is naturally sharp when the great weapon is drawn from its scabbard. His duet with Hibiscus Grass in the wedding scene is a contest of skills, a perfect match. And Hibiscus Grass's monologue skill is already profound, thus receiving the support of peonies and green leaves.</p>
<h3>My Enterprise Talk (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Assuming annual sales of 200,000, deducting 5% for advertising yields 10,000. After deducting 3,000 for regular advertising, there is still 7,000 yuan available for temporary special advertising. Adopting a small profits but quick turnover strategy, assuming a 2% gross profit, yields a surplus of 40,000. Deducting 20,000 for expenses, the net profit is 20,000, which is a 20% return on every hundred yuan. As seen above, it is clear that with the financial resources of a few people, pooling ten thousand yuan to start a business often leads to more failures than successes. The interest rate must be at least 3%, while expenses are only 3,000. Can 250 yuan a month possibly cover all rent, miscellaneous fees, and employee salaries (labor costs are included in the cost of goods)? Even if possible, the dividends would be nowhere to be found. If it is a company, then as in the tenfold calculation described later, even the smaller ones would have ample surplus, ensuring success. The difference between labor and leisure is vast. If one prefers labor to leisure and is willing to participate in the work, the articles of association can specify the qualifications for resident directors and supervisors. For example, those who raise more than 10,000 yuan will undoubtedly be elected in this small company with 100,000 capital. In general, the shareholders recruited by a person will certainly elect that person, without a doubt. Assuming there are five directors and three supervisors, besides oneself, there are seven others working together for assistance. Compared to playing a solo act, the difference between labor and leisure is like heaven and earth. And all facilities and plans are led by experienced people and come from collective wisdom. Naturally, they are much better than those who are independent and without assistance. Therefore, I, Xu, am designing for entrepreneurs to first seek friends and then choose a suitable business, joining forces to proceed. Then success can be assured. Otherwise, lightly trying and testing is better than depositing in a bank, avoiding the risk of failure. Some say that banks also have the risk of bankruptcy and that the interest is very low. I say that for those who have surplus power, it is better to invest excess capital in any company as a shareholder to enjoy a higher profit than depositing in a bank to earn interest. To prevent bankruptcy, it is the same principle. Generally speaking, money is the most difficult to leave. Even if hidden in a cellar, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not be corroded by the nitrate and sulfur gases in the geology. (Move to reward disaster relief)</p>

<h3>The Country Bumpkin Arrives in Shanghai Again (13)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>He now remembered what his nephew had said: after getting off the train, he could take a tram to the French Concession.</p>
<p>Just outside the iron gate was a tram going from the North Railway Station to Ximen. He thought, "My nephew A Mulin told me that it's not far from Ximen to Meilanfang." He saw many people crowding onto the tram, and he挤ed onto it too. He thought: the first time I came to Shanghai, I rode in fourth class. This time I came to Shanghai, I rode in third class. Now that I am taking a tram, I should at least move up another level. I will take a second-class tram. People always want to climb higher. I will first take a second-class tram, and when I go back, I will be willing to spend a few more dollars and take a second-class train again. Wouldn't that mean that I have risen from a third-class character to a second-class character? He just got on the tram when the ticket seller came over.</p>
<p>"This is first class." The ticket seller saw a country bumpkin and thought he had gotten on the wrong car, so he warned him.</p>
<p>"Oh dear! Then I want to go to the second-class car. Please open the door for me." The country bumpkin quickly stood up and asked the ticket seller to lead him to the second-class car.</p>
<p>The ticket seller looked at him, but did not answer him, thinking that this person was really a fool.</p>
<p>"Stop dawdling, take out the coins. Where are you going? Buy a ticket."</p>
<p>"Hey! I am telling you to lead me to the second-class car! I want to ride in a second-class tram."</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was a passenger nearby who knew that this gentleman was new to Shanghai, so he told him, "There are only first class and third class on trams, there is no second class."</p>
<p>"This is strange. On trains, there are first class, second class, third class, and fourth class. The various classes are clearly distinguished. How is it that there are only first class and third class on trams, and the second class has been removed? What is the reason for this?"</p>
<p>"I don't understand that either. In short, there are only first class and third class on trams, there is no second class. If you want to ride in first class, then sit here. If you want to ride in third class, then go sit next door. The tram is about to leave."</p>
<p>The country bumpkin looked out the glass window at the third-class car next door, and it was very crowded. Several passengers had no seats and were pulling on a strap, as if they were hanging up their bodies. He thought that it would be better to spend a few more dollars and ride in first class. After all, he would be a first-class person once, and he could go back to his hometown and boast to those who had never been to Shanghai.</p>
<p>However, he always wondered why the Shanghai trams had first class and third class, but no second class?</p>

<h3>Gold Price Enters Six Hundred Taels</h3>
<p>▲ Silver price skyrocketing caused continuous declines. Yesterday, the gold price hit a new low again in the tenth day. The speed of the decline was unexpected, but the chaotic situation was unstoppable. There were often swings of ten taels. The total market saw eighteen taels of trading, which was unpredictable. In the end, it continued to fall by sixteen taels and some odd change. However, buyers accounted for the majority, likely because the silver market continued to rise sharply and because the International Bank was also planning to propose the silver price issue. Therefore, it weakened at the beginning and immediately broke through the six hundred tael mark. There were many twists and turns afterward, but the Dalian gang and Guangdong gang took the opportunity to compete to buy. Although the foreign exchange rate had risen, the weakening of the domestic market was a good sign. And with the saying that the Northeast Army had repelled the violent Japanese, the market atmosphere was favorable, and it broke through six hundred taels again. Although there were fluctuations in the future market, they were not fierce, only advances and retreats of four or five taels.</p>
<p>▲ The market opened with a sharp drop and then presented twists and turns. It opened sharply lower by nine taels, at six hundred and four taels. The large bars rose sharply by one cent and six two five, and the silver price rose by one cent and three seven five. However, the Dalian gang first bought in, followed by zero four taels and five qian, and then resold. The Da De Cheng Heng Chang Yong Yi Feng and the merchandise also sold out. Then British gold immediately trended hard, and the bank initially consumed it, at eleven cents two five for one month. Immediately, HSBC issued three seven five, immediately breaking through six hundred taels. And with British gold quoted at large seven five and US dollars at one yuan three seven five, at that time it was ninety-two three taels. Yu Da Qian Chang Xiang and the foreign businessman Qiao Zhifu and others did not slack in selling, and the market situation deteriorated further, breaking through the five hundred and ninety taels mark. The British gold bank's buying price reached eleven cents six two five, and the China Banking Corporation's US dollar pairing was thirty-seven yuan six two five. At ten o'clock, a new low peak of eighty-six taels and five qian appeared. In a moment, the buyers showed their bravery. Fu Chang Heng Xing Tong Tai Chang Qian Chang Xiang Da De Cheng Yi Feng Yong Yuan Mao Yong and others worked hard to pull in. Then British gold softened, settling the forward three seven five and recent half cent. The industry changed to stripping, and the China-Belgium and other banks issued thirty-seven yuan one eight seven five for December. Then the gold price soared beyond ten taels. At ten thirty, it was ninety-seven taels five. However, there were fluctuations of two or three taels in an instant. Soon after, the China Banking Corporation issued US dollars at thirty-seven yuan three one two five for January, and British gold at eleven cents and a half for December. Shunli Wanxing and others sold slightly, and then fell by five or six taels. At eleven o'clock and zero, it was ninety-one taels five, and then it went up again. Da De Cheng Fu Yu Yuan Mao Yong Tong Tai Chang and other companies had a keen buying interest, and US dollars could be sold at thirty-seven yuan. So it turned to an upward trend. It is estimated that it rose more than eleven taels. At eleven forty-five, it was six hundred and three taels. Then, because the Indian remittance reported Da Ba Anna, it retreated four taels to ninety-eight taels and a half. The noon close was still six hundred and two taels five, and it was suppressed again to around six hundred and one taels. In fact, the people's hearts were bewildered and unstable. The revealed price was changed to six hundred and sixty-nine taels, and the squeeze was estimated at around eighty taels to within seventy taels.</p>
<p>▲ The result was a further drop of sixteen taels and two. The afternoon market opened at ninety-nine taels and a half, followed by nine taels to six hundred taels. Soon after, Shunli Wanxing and others sold, cutting off more than four taels, to ninety-five taels and five qian. The exchange rate was flat. Maihangdao sold two and three month contracts for thirty-seven yuan zero six two five to one two five. Yuan Mao Yong Heng Xing pulled in even more. At two fifteen, it was six hundred and one taels. At this time, the buying trend arose, and at two thirty, it was ninety-six taels and five qian. However, Guangbang Heng Xing and Wanxing came in, and the price rose by more than five taels. At three o'clock, it was six hundred and two taels. Later, Tong Tai Chang Yu Da and the foreign businessman Qiao Zhifu came on the scene to sell, and because the exchange rate was not firm, it turned downstream. However, from three to four o'clock, there were three or four taels of rotation. Around four o'clock, it was ninety-six taels five to six hundred taels. Suddenly, it was heard that the Indian remittance was Da Ba Anna again, and it fell to ninety-seven taels five. Yi Feng Heng Xing continued to rise to ninety-nine taels. Then, because British gold could be settled at eleven pence three one two five, and US dollars at thirty-seven yuan one two five, retail investors on the table sold, and it fell back to ninety-six taels near the close. At four thirty, the market closed at ninety-six taels eight qian, a drop of sixteen taels two qian compared to the previous day. It had fallen for three consecutive days, totaling more than fifty-four taels. After the close, the market was again hyped to ninety-eight. Scattered short positions were approaching. According to the largest intraday price of six hundred and four taels five and the smallest price of five hundred and eighty-six taels five, the difference was eighteen taels. The merchandise opened early at zero three taels five, one taels five in the afternoon, ninety-nine taels in the afternoon, and closed at ninety-six taels five. The revealed price was estimated to be squeezed at seventy taels, and the registration replenishment was zero three taels in the morning market and ninety-seven taels in the afternoon market. The red bar was estimated to add ten taels.</p>
<p>▲ Various firms' transactions had no systematic on the table transactions were chaotic, statistical Yuan Mao Yong Da De Cheng Fu Chang Ri Chang Bing Xing Qian Chang Xiang Wan Xing Shunli Heng Xing Yi Feng Yong Fu Tai Heng Tong Tai Chang were all in, Zhi Feng Yong Yuan Tai Da Xing Yong Yu Da Fu Yu sometimes in, sometimes out. Foreign businessman Qiao Zhifu sold short positions, Yi Feng Heng Chang Yong Yuan Xing Yong and retail investors mostly sold. Exchange rate hedgers had inconsistent receipts and payments. In the afternoon, Heng Xing Yuan Mao Yong Heng Chang Yong Wan Xing Yi Feng Yong all entered. Shunli Yuan Tai Fu Tai Heng Sen Chang Yong Da Cheng Tong De Run Heng Yu and others had many ins and outs. Da De Cheng Qian Chang Xiang Qiao Zhifu Tong Tai Chang all exited. The Dalian gang entered more than three thousand five hundred, and exited more than one thousand. The Guangdong gang entered two thousand five hundred to six hundred, and exited seven to eight hundred.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Shows Signs of Weakness</h3>
<p>▲ Trading. Chinese merchants first throw, then pull. ▲ Hedging is forty taels apart</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, and Indian silver markets rose sharply, while foreign exchange rates fell for the British and rose for the American. The HSBC listed price increased by as much as three stops, with British gold increasing by seven five, to two shillings ten pence half. US dollars increased by one yuan three seven five, to thirty-five yuan eight seven five. Hong Kong decreased by two five, estimated at seventy-five taels five qian. The remaining exchanges also increased further. It seems that the domestic market first loosened and then stabilized, and then seemed to weaken again. However, the gold market actually broke through the six hundred tael mark, with new lows appearing repeatedly. People's hearts were panic-stricken, and there was no special news from abroad.

<h3>Interest Rates Turn Weak, Silver Dismantling Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silver dollar situation in the market was mostly without major fluctuations. Due to the fact that Guangbang had a source, the Yangli's situation turned weak. The early market was seven qian two fen six li seven hao and a half. The afternoon market was seven qian two fen six li, seeming to fall seven hao and a half. The silver dismantling was three qian five fen in the early market and three qian three fen in the afternoon market, not much of an increase or decrease from the previous day.

<h3>Securities and Bond Markets Turn Leisurely Again</h3>
<p>▲ Each sector moved up and down very slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 10th), the spot market in the securities exchange bond market had a bit of trading only in the morning, and the afternoon market did not open. The futures market was also chaotic, and people's hearts were watching. The market was slightly clear, and buying and selling ins and outs were leisurely. Although the current bond market situation was still good, and there were no major diplomatic changes, there was a sudden riot in Tianjin, and Japan had already declared that it would not withdraw its troops. The diplomatic situation was also becoming increasingly serious. The general public was suspicious, and large households were increasingly watching. Even retail investors' ins and outs were not as good as before. Because of this, the market transaction turned clear, and the demand for supply was in balance. Bond market prices have not risen or fallen much before and after the market, and the stagnation is unprecedented in recent days. As a result, compared with the previous day, the situation was very chaotic, and rises and falls were mixed. The number was only around four or five corners. Judging from the trend, it has become more and more dull and will change with the changes in the diplomatic situation. If there is no development in the diplomatic situation, it is feared that there will be no major ups and downs for the time being. It is estimated that futures trading was 6.23 million in the morning market and 2.155 million yuan in the afternoon market, totaling 8.385 million yuan. Spot trading was only 15,500 yuan in the morning.</p>

<h3>Hesitant State of Yarn, Cotton, and Yarn Markets</h3>
<p>The yarn market showed a comeback at noon after being flat in the morning, but the situation was still weak. Due to many rumors about the current situation and the extreme shortage of finance, people's hearts were softened. However, after the big drop, it caused some profit-takers to cover their short positions, and the market was firm. Sales of current yarn are very quiet.</p>
<p>▲ Cotton Mark Morning Low, Noon Comeback. The Cotton Standard market opened in the morning with a slight increase in American cotton. Sellers in the market decreased slightly. Each month fell by six or seven qian, and the second and third sectors gradually came back up. As a result, they fell by one, two, and three qian. There was a part of the short covering in the afternoon, and each month rose by two, three, and five qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 37,150 bales. It was found that Dafu sold 3,750 bales, Rongxing sold 3,450 bales, Shenji sold 900 bales, and Yichang sold 2,500 bales. The buyers were Gongtai 500 bales, Taixing 2,350 bales, Gengfeng 3,050 bales, and Ruida 1,250 bales. The closing prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Cotton Mark Closing Increase or Decrease Inventory Number</p>
<p>November 1557 Fall 6 51,400 February 1564 Rise 3 76,000</p>
<p>December 1561 1 78,100 March 1563 59,700</p>
<p>January 1563 Rise 5 87,350 April 1561 3 27,250</p>
<p>▲ Yarn Sales Are Extremely Scattered. Sales of current yarn are very clear. It was found that the total statistics for each gang buying was only 270 bales. 65 bales entered the trade, and the market situation was weak. Among customer gangs, Shantou entered 20 bales, Xiamen entered 30 bales, the mainland entered 100 bales, Jiangxi entered 40 bales, and miscellaneous gangs entered 25 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Shows Slight Rebound</h3>
<p>The cotton market saw a slight rebound. Although U.S. cotton production is estimated to increase by more than 500,000 bales, prices have risen instead. As a result, buyers' sentiment stabilized, and they continued to increase their purchases, causing the market to rise. However, gold prices plummeted while silver prices soared. Shenxin and Yong'an factories have been purchasing large quantities of Indian and American cotton for days, estimated to be tens of thousands of bales. Currently, Xingheng cotton, which can spin 20-count yarn, is only worth 29.5 taels. Given this situation, the future of local cotton is severely impacted. However, due to the current shortage of spot goods in warehouses, bulls have not given up on squeezing the shorts, making a rebound likely.</p>
<p>▲Hankou Mark Bulls Increase Positions: The opening price of Hankou Mark was weak due to increased U.S. cotton production and the sharp fall in the gold market. Prices initially fell by two or three cents, but rebounded in the afternoon, resulting in a five-cent increase for each month. Bulls increased their positions in the afternoon, leading to a rise of 1.5 to 4.5 cents. The total trading volume was 121,700 piculs. Sales included Yuan Da 3,000 piculs, Tong Yu 3,100 piculs, Yi Chang 4,200 piculs, Heng De 3,500 piculs, Ji Feng 2,400 piculs, Shen Yu 3,300 piculs, and Chang Feng 3,000 piculs. Purchases included Tian Long 5,200 piculs, Yu Chang 5,200 piculs, and Yuan Tai Chang 4,200 piculs. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Hankou Mark Closing Prices, Fluctuations, and Open Interest</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Rebounds by More Than Ten Points</h3>

Futures rose 13 to 16 points, and spot prices rose 15 points. English cotton futures rose 4 to 6 points, while spot prices fell 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 10 points. The Indian cotton market was quiet but firm, with Pingor and White Rose each down 0.5 rupees, and Oomra down 0.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (dated 9th):</p>

<h3>River Rice in Zhabei Suddenly Rises by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>▲ Nantou: Yesterday, several boats from various guilds arrived. Due to the gloomy weather and stable sentiment, and also hearing that Zhabei was taking delivery of goods first, the market was particularly active. Transactions increased compared to yesterday, with Houxin japonica rice prices suddenly rising by half a yuan. Arrivals of thin indica rice were scarce, while Ningbo indica rice was slightly more available, and prices also increased by 30-40 cents. Arrivals and sales of foreign Dujian rice were also rare, and prices followed suit, increasing by 20 cents. Arrivals of Yinyuan rice were not substantial, and distilleries were actively purchasing, leading to a price increase of several cents.</p>
<p>▲ Zhabei (New): Yesterday, due to the unfavorable weather, shops purchased goods for inventory in this period. Historically, rice prices have always risen after the Beginning of Winter. Sales prices for early and late indica rice increased by nearly 10 cents. Sales of port Dujian rice were extremely active, rising by 5 cents. Yinyuan rice was sold as soon as it arrived, and prices increased rapidly. Arrivals from inland areas were scarce because the Yejidun area was unable to ship due to winds. Therefore, arrivals were few. Stale and broken foreign rice was sluggish, so the trend was stable.</p>
<h3>Label Flour Plunges Sharply</h3>
<p>▲Tianjin Sales Completely Stop... Gold Prices Plunge</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, significant declines were seen in all months. Due to the Japanese riots in Tianjin, the market was disrupted, and spot and futures goods from the Tianjin guild were either halted or returned. Furthermore, the continuous sharp decline in the gold market, falling by 20-30 taels more than the previous day, further destabilized sentiment. Therefore, after the opening, near-term and distant-term prices plummeted by 2-3 cents. This month's price even entered the 1-cent range, and the severity of the decline is evident. By the afternoon opening, the overall market had stabilized, and speculative bulls increased their buying, causing near-term and distant-term prices to rebound by 1-2 cents. Looking ahead, as sales in the north have completely stopped, there is no opportunity for higher prices. As a result, this month's price fell by 2.5 cents compared to the previous day, December fell by 7.5 cents, and January to April each fell by 5 cents.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Declines Sharply</h3>
<p>▲Market Recovers Slightly After Covering Shorts</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, prices for all months declined sharply. Due to another sharp fall in gold prices, quotations for foreign wheat weakened. Moreover, the turmoil in the country and the Japanese riots in Tianjin led to widespread anxiety and uncertainty. Therefore, after the opening, prices plummeted. This month's price fell to 7.3 cents, December to 7.8 cents, January to 8.4 cents, and February to 9.3 cents, a decline of 6-7 cents or more compared to the previous day's closing. By the afternoon opening, the market rebounded due to the recovery in gold prices and the urgent covering of shorts, rising by as much as 6-7 cents from the lowest point. In the context of a turbulent situation, rising and falling prices seemed to be the norm in the market. As a result, this month's price fell by 2 cents compared to the previous day, December fell by 2 cents, January-February fell by 4 cents, March fell by 1 cent, and April fell by 2 cents.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Wuxi Silk Factories Gradually Shut Down</h3>
<p>White silk sales to Europe have been declining sharply. Due to the cheap Japanese silk sales in New York, factory prices have become even lower, and manufacturers' losses have increased significantly. Unable to sustain, they have been reducing production and shutting down machines. According to Mr. Zhu, a silk merchant from Wuxi, the sluggishness of silk sales to Europe has reached its peak, with almost no one interested. The stockpiles of silk have been increasing, and silk factories are unable to maintain operations. They have had to temporarily shut down to avoid bankruptcy. Out of the 48 new and old silk factories in Wuxi, 30 have already shut down, and the remaining 10 are struggling to operate. If silk sales to Europe and America do not improve, the operating factories will inevitably be forced to continue shutting down.</p>
<h3>Dull Silk Sales in Europe and America</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market at foreign firms in Shanghai became increasingly dull. Due to the competitive sale of stockpiled silk by speculators in the New York market, prices have weakened further. No telegrams from England and France have been received in Shanghai, and Chinese silk merchants are feeling despondent. Yesterday, only Xin Shichang imported 20 packages of white dried silk, Dachang imported 10 packages of Jiaxing green silk, and Meida imported 5 packages of yellow coarse silk, with prices remaining low and weak.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market is in a State of Irreversible Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market at foreign firms in Shanghai remained quiet. Merchants still held a wait-and-see attitude towards the firm green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi, and no one inquired about it at all. Furthermore, with the increasing price of future shipments and the competitive sale of cheap Japanese tea, the sales of Chinese tea have decreased significantly, causing the market to be in a state of irreversible decline. Yesterday, only Dodechanglong and other firms purchased a total of 80-plus boxes of Zhenmei and Xiumei green tea, and there were no other transactions.</p>
<h3>High Price of Dried Longan Meat in Zhabei</h3>
<p>The production of Shima dried longan this year is very poor, making sun-dried longan meat even scarcer. According to inquiries, various firms have yet to receive any shipments. According to local reports, the price per load has risen to 120 yuan. Adding all external expenses, the cost to Shanghai is nearly 100 taels. Various guilds here have considerable demand and are currently sending letters to the origin to urge shipment. It is estimated that shipments will arrive next week.</p>
<h3>Flat Iron on the Hardware Market: 3-4,000 Loads Arrive Yesterday</h3>
<p>Flat iron sheets have been in short supply for many days, making it difficult for general purchasers to find goods to buy. Yesterday, Qichang Firm received a new shipment of 3-4,000 loads. These were ordered by iron businesses in the North Suzhou Road area, so future transactions are bound to be very active. The price is reportedly 18.5 taels per load. It is said that 300-500 loads have already been sold, and the buyers are primarily established customers in the Hankou area. Customers from the Fujian-Zhejiang Road area have also made some purchases.</p>

<h3>Summer Olympia Auto Show</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>The much-publicized London Summer Olympia Auto Show officially opened on November 5th. One hour before the opening, crowds of people from far and wide flocked to London to visit, so crowded that the roads were impassable. This year's attendees were more enthusiastic than previous shows. After the opening, visitors surged into the venue one after another. Even in the evening, the number of visitors did not decrease significantly. The majority of these visitors were from England. Although the vehicles on display included products from manufacturers from various countries besides England, the general public's attention was primarily focused on British products. From this, it is not difficult to see the patriotism of the English people. Comparing the vehicles from various countries, British cars excel in low price, artistic exterior, excellent materials, and attractive bodywork.</p>
<p>Visitors paid particular attention to the products of Austin, Morris, Talbot, Vauxhall, New Cugnot, Humber, Standard, Leyland, Hillman, and other British car manufacturers. Although on-site orders were not particularly enthusiastic, most car dealers were optimistic about the future, expecting business to improve next year. Cars priced below 300 pounds attracted the most attention, and small cars with 8 to 10 horsepower were especially popular. British manufacturers have made several improvements to gear-shifting methods in their new cars this year. After several test drives, they are now even more suitable for female drivers. As for fuel consumption, it is also very economical. There were also many overseas visitors, setting a new record not seen since the war. Such a grand occasion has indeed not been seen in England since the war. Many overseas visitors, after seeing the special progress in the engineering of British vehicles, were full of admiration. As for the motorboats on display in the venue, there were fewer than last year. More details about the advantages of various new cars will be provided in the next issue.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Hunan-Guangdong Railway Project (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shan Lang</p>
<p>The Hengyang-Chenzhou section, starting from Hengyang and ending in Chenzhou, is a crucial route to Guangdong. In June of the 12th year of the Republic (1923), the Hunan Southern Rehabilitation Office planned to build the Heng-Chen military road. By September of the 14th year of the Republic (1925), 50 li of earth road construction from Dongyangdu to Simaqiao was finally completed. Bridge construction also proceeded gradually. In October of the same year, the Hunan Southern Automobile Road Bureau was established to take over the management. To expedite the project, the Heng-Chen route, being too long, was divided into Heng-Leiyang and Leiyang-Chenzhou sections, each with a supervising engineer to proceed separately. The Heng-Leiyang section starts from the east bank of the Xiang River in Hengyang, passing through important villages and towns such as Dongyangdu, Hetianshi, Liaotian, and Xuchunjiangpu to reach Leiyang, a distance of approximately 150 li. The Leiyang-Chenzhou section passes through Xiaoshui, Puwuqiaopu, Matianxu, Gaotingsi, and Qifengdu to reach Chenzhou, a distance of approximately 180 li. The Heng-Leiyang section was surveyed in February of the 15th year of the Republic (1926) and construction commenced in full. The Leiyang-Chenzhou section began surveying in November of the 14th year of the Republic and commenced construction in January of the following year. However, due to military conflicts, financial constraints, and frequent changes of directors, the project was not actively pursued. It was not until October of the 16th year of the Republic (1927) that the Hengyang-Gaotingsi section was completed and opened to traffic. In January of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the Chenzhou-Leiyang section was ravaged by communist bandits, and the staff scattered, leading to the suspension of the project. In July of the same year, after the banditry was somewhat quelled, construction continued, and the entire section was finally completed in December. The entire Heng-Chen section then opened to traffic. The terrain of the entire section is undulating hills, winding and tortuous. The selected route mostly follows the mountains, with excessive cutting of earth, which is not economical. The road width is 21 feet, the maximum slope is 6%, and the minimum radius is 100 feet. Rivers and streams are everywhere, with a total of 130 large and small bridges, spanning 1,314 feet. The old Qifengdu bridge spans approximately 300 feet. It was originally planned to add a reinforced concrete bridge deck, and the auxiliary piers were completed. Due to a lack of funds and the urgent need for traffic, the old bridge was slightly repaired to allow for slow-moving vehicles to pass through. So far, there have been no adverse phenomena. The earth and stone works for the entire section, except for the high embankment in the flood area from the east bank of the Xiang River to Dongyangdu and the large-scale excavation of stone mountains in Chunjiangpu and Huaguxi, are mostly easy. For the road surface, river sand is mostly used from the east bank of the Xiang River to Duiziling, which is close to the river. Mountain sand is easily obtained on both sides from Duiziling to Liaotianxu, and it is mostly used. From Liaotianxu to Chenzhou, pebbles in the river port are difficult to obtain, so hammered sand is mostly used. Bridge building materials are sandstone and bluestone. Bluestone is the best material, followed by sandstone. The stations are temporary buildings. A garage and dormitory for staff have been built at the Xiang River East Bank Station in Hengyang. Recently, a station has been added in Gaotingsi. Four道棚 have been completed, and telephone poles and lines have been installed. The total project cost was approximately 2,160,000 yuan. The local products along the route, such as rice and lotus roots from Hengyang, coal mines from Leiyang, and antimony and tin from Chenzhou, are the most famous. With the completion of this road, transportation will be convenient, and the prospects for industry and commerce are promising.</p>
<p>The Chenzhou-Yizhang section connects with the Heng-Chen section outside the west gate of Chenzhou, passing through Wansui Bridge, Liangtian, Liaojiawan, Maijiaoping, Shapingling, Yizhang County, to reach Xiaotang, located 15 li from Yizhang on the Hunan-Guangdong border, a distance of 105 li. The Hunan Third Road Bureau began surveying in February of the 18th year of the Republic (1929), constructing in sections. In November of the same year, the Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau took over and continued the project. The progress: the bottom layer of coarse sand has been laid from Chenzhou to Liangtian, and most of the earthworks from Liangtian to Yizhang have been completed. There are five large bridges between Chenzhou and Yizhang, spanning 300 feet, thirteen small bridges, spanning 195 feet, and 101 culverts, spanning 427 feet. The piers and arches of all bridges have been built, and stone and sand are mostly prepared. Due to the Gui-Communist disaster in Hunan, the project was completely halted due to lack of funds. After the survey of the Yizhang-Xiaotang section was completed, construction was never started due to financial constraints. The entire section's route was determined by the Third Road Bureau. From Chenzhou, the route follows the Zhiyi Road for 30 li to reach Wansui Bridge, and then passes through Zouma Ridge and Caoxie Ridge between Yizhang and Chen-Wan. Due to the rugged terrain and many rivers, the project was huge. Later, the route was changed to run west from the Chenzhou Confucian Temple, passing through Chongqiang Ridge and Wujia Bridge to reach the west side of Wansui Bridge. After the change, the slope was gentler, there were no bridges, and the cost was greatly reduced. After crossing Wansui Bridge, the Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau also re-established the route to avoid difficult projects and save construction costs. The revised route runs from Liangtian, bypassing to Liaojiawan and Haokou to reach Maijiaoping, and then to Yizhang, passing through Bailutang, Huangtushan, and Jieganting to reach Xiaotang. The maximum slope of the entire section is 6%, in about three or four places, and the minimum radius is 120 feet, in about one or two places. The most difficult part of the route is the area below the stone cliffs of Liaojiawan. The stone mountains stand steep, with a rapid stream below. The original narrow path is only a foot wide, running along the mountainside, resembling a narrow sheep track. Although there is farmland below, the river runs through it, and the entire area is flooded during mountain floods. The route is prone to collapse. For a permanent solution, it is proposed to run along the mountainside, excavating stone on one side and building dikes on the other. Although the project is large, the roadbed is solid. At the river crossing, a large stone bridge with a 30-foot span and three arches will be built to allow the rapid stream to pass. The next difficult area is the Huangtu area between Yizhang and Xiaotang. The downhill slope is too steep, making it inconvenient for vehicles. During future construction, precise surveying and special planning will still be required. (End)</p>
<h3>Ever-Changing Renault Cars</h3>
<p>▲Wireless Radio Inside Car ▲Separate Dark Compartment for Valuables</p>
<p>▲Extraordinary Revolution in the Automobile World</p>
<p>Renault cars are produced by a famous Italian factory. The car body is very beautiful, and the machinery is extremely sturdy and durable, which has always been praised by people from all countries. Mr. Tong Zhenyuan, the manager of Tongyuan Automobile Company on Avenue Foch, has shipped three batches of new cars, all of which have been sold out, indicating that the car is deeply trusted by the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mr. Tong Zhenyuan, the manager of the company, has long been involved in automobile research. Because the internal and external facilities of various automobiles on the sea are not satisfactory, he specially set up a manufacturing department. Anyone can design in person to their satisfaction. According to the company, the car customized by a well-known person in Shanghai at the end of last month was very satisfied. He said that customizing a Renault car is better than buying many other cars.</p>
<p>Mr. Tong is now customizing a Renault car with a special wireless radio installed in the car. Whether driving anywhere, just turn the engine and you can listen to all kinds of music. Mr. Tong also realized that bandits are rampant on the sea, and women often wear ornaments when they go out, which is often noticed by bandits. Therefore, he came up with a unique idea and specially made a dark compartment, equipped with a famous lock. Once closed, it is difficult to detect unless explicitly indicated. It is said that the compartment can hold two self-prepared pistols and many pieces of jewelry.</p>
