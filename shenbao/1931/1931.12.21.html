<h3 id="c29">四屆一中全書 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>國民黨第四屆中央委員會第一次全會。將於明日正式開幕。亘半年來之爭持。甯粤雙方領袖。今始得聚首一堂。相與重新討論奠定黨國之大計。而舉國人民所仰望切盼之和平統一。今日亦始有實現希望。故此次會議。實爲國民黨存亡斷續之關鍵亦即我全體人民鎭靜忍耐視聽所注。吾人願於大會開幕之始。就見所及略貢數端。</p>
<p>吾人認爲在今日大會開幕之初。國民黨諸委員。應先作一次鄭重之思慮。即今後之國民黨。將從何以表示其不同於前日之國民黨。今後之政治。將從何以表示其不同於前日之政治尤應鄭重思慮前日之政府。何以有今日之改弦更張。舉國人民。何以對前政府悲憤側目。假如今後之黨。無以異於前日之黨。今後之政治。無以異於前日之政治。今後所不同於前日者。惟爲委員人數之擴充。惟爲職位人選之更迭則今後人民對於黨與政府之態度將如何。黨與政府之結局又將如何。故曰此次會議爲舉國人民視聽之所注。亦即國民黨本身存亡斷續之關鍵。</p>
<p>關於黨之本身諸問題。吾人固不必借箸代籌。不過吾人不得不聲言者。即歷年來糾紛擾攘。分崩離析。使兵連禍結。國本動摇。民不堪命者。皆爲國民黨黨内曾共甘苦患難之同志。而非黨外之敵人。故人民對於國民黨由擁護愛戴而漸以冷淡懷縬强者發諸言。儒者厲於色。皆由於國民黨之自召。而非由於人民主觀意識之錯覺。民十五黨軍北伐。舉國人民對於國民黨擁護愛戴之熱烈。誠有若大旱之望雲霓。以今衡昔。蓋眞不堪回首。於此可見民視最明。民聽最聰。人民之方寸間。自有其秤量政府之權衡。與人民結成一片之黨與政府。必能博得人民擁護愛戴。否則必爲人民所共厭共棄。此其間蓋毫無可以讓步緩和之餘地。</p>
<p>關於内政吾人於前此數日。旣已略舉數端。即應以澈底之態度。與斷然之行動。　覆軍人政治官僚政治之根基。建設民主的廉潔的以國家人民利益爲前提運中樞政府。其在行政方面。最切要者。則爲財政必須公開交通必須發展。工商業必須保護提倡。憲法必須早日制成人民之一切自由。必須予以充分之保障。目前之災荒必予以充分之救濟。總之新舊更替。凡百庶政。皆應澈底改革以盪滌過去之積弊改弦而更張。其惟一之要點。在於政府是否確能以國家與人民之利害爲立脚點如其能則其所表現於政治。雖不中當亦不遠。若徒喊口號徒佈文告口是而心非則其所表現於政治者必與人民日益乖離尤有進者青年爲社會之中堅爲國家之元氣。數年來國内青年之無辜慘死者。不可數計。此實爲我國家無可彌補之損失。青年在書本上所學。與眼前目擊之事實。常隔天淵。青年之理想與現實。常相矛盾。在此種刺激之下。儒者流入消極之途。强者自起而作疾聲之呼籲。此殆無可避免亦即最堪惋惜之現象故假如政府本身而眞具有不可掩飾之弱點假如政府而眞與人民背道而馳則中外古今之歷史篇幅中絶無可以以權力鎭壓住「反動狂潮」之行例老子曰。「民不畏死。奈何以死懼之。」此又今日國民黨諸中委所應重新考慮者也。</p>
<p>關於外交國民黨固素以廢除不平等條約打倒帝國主義。恢復我國家在國際上之自由平等之革命外交昭示萬民者。今日陷東北。國聯援助之希望已絶而錦州方面告急之狼烟又起據英記者賴斯摩對此次東北問題之所揭示。則更謂東北禍變之發生。爲國際間一種預定之陰謀。行且引起七國間之戰爭。又據美史汀生之宣稱。亦謂歐洲將即有大變爆發。是則國際政治前途之險惡。蓋可預料。我國究如何以應付迫在目前之外患。更將何以應付國際上瞬息萬變之難局此爲最重大之問題。亦爲最迫切之問題但無論將來所確定之外交政策爲何若。吾人則堅决認定我國土之尺寸。决不容輕易予人。辱國喪權之條約。决不容再訂。東北之失地。必須收回。境内之敵騎。必須驅逐。萬不容有東北之陷落。在事實上已無可如何之存心。而長此敷衍拖延。使半壁山河。就此易色。今日之事。能戰而後能守。能守而後能和。故我國固不欲戰。但爲衛國守土。並以維護和平與正義。則不容不備戰。吾人認爲外交必須自助自决。絶不容依賴仰望於他國之援助。我民族應具甯爲玉碎不爲瓦全之决心。絶不容存有屈服退讓以圖苟安之倖心。</p>
<p>總之目前一切。百孔千瘡。皆待彌補。國脈民命此時都已臨到最後之關頭。在此羣英畢集之大會中應如何下一最大决心。國民黨諸領袖。其好自爲之。</p>

<p>二星期前、曁南與上海隊作高級盃初賽、竟以一比二受擊而淘汰今以三比二克之於甲組賽、未始不可稍復大仇於萬一、惟昨日形勢甚劣險象百出新門陳部章、挽救不少尚堪嘉許、其他人員、平平而已、</p>
<p>▲漁人得利</p>
<p>上場十五分鐘不分勝負、雖曁南時有進攻、俱射之未準、而驚訊傳來、曁南忽告失守、其經過則如此、白克斯德自右方沿邊急進侵入轉瞬已達門次、馮運佑趕往阻禦江善敬見已失事、亦往救援同進一路、白克斯德向左射門、金勃衝上、猛烈不可當、球遂打人、可稱漁人坐收其利、</p>
<h3 id="c102">▲黑炭挑門 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>曁南並不示弱、陳鎭和在門前猛射、正中進門、卡奈爾竟能撲出、上海隊亦來攻打、白克斯德而金勃、其勢危殆、陳部章欲救倒地、幸馮運佑一頂而出時已三十分鐘、陳丘羅並駕而上、將達門前、法平一勾而出、梅擲進、羅而陳而丘、丘射門、卡未賜出、龍跑入正可蹴人、一滑仆地、正皆嘆惜、陳鎭和趁勢一挑、適過卡頭落門内、卡轉門、球已越白線矣、</p>
<p>▲二次平手</p>
<p>皆大歡喜、不移時、曁南果繼之又中、梅洪寶自右而進、向左轉、陳鎭和得之、眼見滿佈敵人、急遞與丘、東炎輕輕一撥、滾滾而入、上半時曁南遂二比一居先、下半時開始上海隊迫門、陳部章衝出、惠斯勿倫、順手一擊打人、惟裁判法眼明鑒、不之計、然左攻右擊、仍絡續不絶、白克斯德一馬直衝、卒爲之進、二比二第二次再和局、</p>
<p>▲最後勝利</p>
<p>曁南處此困境中、已成和局形勢、離終局僅三分鐘矣黑炭跳過數關、將近門前、史篤克之一失、海光脚射入、遂定三比二之勝負、觀者喜極而狂、</p>

<p>▲結果四對零</p>
<p>丨上半時緊張下半時平淡丨</p>
<p>一度戰得高級盃和局之東華與樂華、昨日下午三時仍在中華棒球場重賽九十分鐘、在裁判蔣湘青銀箇聲中、東華以四對零勝樂華、得高級盃複賽權、</p>

<p>陸鍾恩　陸志明　趙霞生　顧尚動　王樹森　陳超</p>
<p>孫惠培　萬象華　江　潮　周紹文　李琳</p>
<p>▲開場互顯精彩</p>
<p>濘滑塲上戰雲初展頓見驚濤駭浪、東西互應、極精彩可觀、樂華先下强手、王樹森送球過内衛五路乘隙並進、内部空虚岌岌可危、巨風忽來救駕球中中途吹還、周絶文收脚不住、終以越位解圍東華假此反攻一瀉千里、陸守門親出關外、力抗各方機遭人算、樂華李琳自右挑中、萬象華頂門、被圍接住、東華乂起大兵、屑開元乘角球之來隨勢射門、陸耀起擒之、可稱一個眼快、一個脚快、樂華萬象華表演佳妙、一鳴驚人、在敵陣中、進出自在、如輔佐得人、功勞簿上、當有紀録也、</p>
<h3 id="c104">東華連得三球 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>二十分鐘惡潮浪波之中、咸未有傾覆之患者、前鋒銳利而内部亦穩堅之故也、華東李義臣首開紀録、球自平地射去、急如矢、陸對之無可如何、又十五分鐘、中堅屠開元自右挑中、落入門之左上角、陸擬擊之、敵人冲至莫明其妙之中球彈入總窩内東華乃勝第二球、再五分鐘、陳洪光戴麟經先後二脚、均中陸氏之身、樂華陳超趕來救駕弄巧成拙自已打入、樂華又負一球、失去三球、激動軍心、全師及撲、險惡異周賢言遂成衆矢之的、斯時專得太平、不無僥倖、上半時終了、東華三對零占先、</p>
<h3 id="c105">後局形勢平淡 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>下半時樂華轉占上風、宜有作爲、不知反見减色、意者銳氣墮而軍心散、然内部分防要隘、努力抵抗、敵方不易輕人、確是實事、前鋒進兵攻城之舉、則偶一爲之耳、開始即見榮華受侵、一攻一守、久久不已、三十分鐘時曾一次出兵關外、江潮由右仰攻、由周救出、從此又伏居關内專行防禦工作、三十七分鐘時陳洪光在門前二十碼處、似進非進之際、忽然舉脚掃出、守門一驚、球已入門、樂華大敗之後、頓起報復之心、衆志成城、勢强難遏、一時東華門前又呈恐慌、要非周氏心定、李關膽壯、難以解圍、休戰笛聲起、東華四對零凱旋、</p>

<h3 id="c159">反對散賣封存的日貨並質薛光前先生（高中暇） <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>生活週刋第六卷五十一期、有薛光前先生一篇通信、對於抗日救國會設計委員會所草擬的處置封存日貨的辦法、有所辯明、這個辦法的草案始終没有公布、外邊人只聽見内容跟商界經濟絶交會所擬的大致相彷、現在看見薛先生的信、更可以證實抗日會設計委員會的草案、的確是散賣的辦法、而不是集中公賣、「無條件的散賣自屬厚誣」但散賣總是散賣、不過是有條件的散賣而已、我認爲目前的爭點、是散賣跟集中公賣兩條路、是非分明、無所用其躊躇徘徊、絶没有妥協的餘地、</p>
<p>所謂有條件的散賣、究竟是怎樣一種條件實行散賣時、許多未登記的日貨、將來私進的貨、怎樣防他們乘機混售、抗日會設計委員會所提出的防弊方法、不外乎三點、（一）發給發賣證、（二）逐件加蓋印記、（三）發賣時另立賬簿、薛先生說、「其防弊及售賣方法至爲愼密、」在我看來、這些辦法、可以說是一種遮眼法、只能騙騙小孩子、假使你有一疋封存的日本布、只要在抗日會登記領到發賣證、便可以公然出賣、買布的人誰有工夫來查問你有没有發賣證、辨别你的發賣證是眞假、而且發賣證跟發賣的貨物、不是拆不開的一個發賣證可以重覆的用許多回、有了一疋登記的日本布、便可以出賣幾十疋幾百疋的日本布、藏起來的私貨、固然可以逐漸出脫、一面還可以再向日本人那裏去進貨、所謂「存貨」將源源而來、永遠不會賣完、一逐件加蓋印記、」更是可笑、請敎日本糖、日本煤、日本海味上面、印記怎樣蓋法、蓋在包裏上面、包裏去掉後怎樣辦、一個包裏作幾十回用、怎樣辦、上梅封存的日貨、價值冋止幾千萬論件數總在一萬萬件以上、假使抗日會派幾十個可信任的職員去蓋印、每疋布上、每隻魚上、每塊煤上、（且不說每顆糖上、）都給他蓋一個印記、幾十個人同時工作、一年半載恐怕還辦不了、這幾十個木戳子誰都能假造、幾天之内、便可以化爲幾千個、一般民衆、看見有糢糊不清的幾個字、便認爲抗日會印記、至於印記是眞是假、我們不是印鑑專家、呌我們怎樣辨别、另立帳簿的辦法、更妙</p>
<p>不可言、如果商人把帳簿備而不用、你有何法可杨總不成每一家店裏、派一個人去監督他、奸商出賣私貨、肯老老實實的記在帳簿上、等你來檢舉、天下决凤有這種獃子、</p>
<p>現在還没有實行散賣、走漏的日貨、已經防不勝防、大家試瞑目一想果然實行散賣、抵貨運動將成何景象、所謂發賣證、所謂逐件加蓋印記、適成奸商的一種護身符、以前還是偷偷摸摸的來、現在竟可以明目張膽的出賣、已登記的貨跟未登記的貨、舊存的貨、跟新進的貨、勢必混淆不清檢查的工作也無從進行、這個隄防一破、日貨一定像潮水般湧進來、泛濫全中國、幾個月來種種努力、種種犧牲、只不過替奸商造發財的機會、一定要把封存的日貨提出發賣、除了集中公賣外、没有第二條路可走、商家要收回成本、儘可以在集中公賣範圍内想法、爲什麽有一般人一定要採取那防無可防的散賣制呢、不想偷東西的人、决計不會反對人家關大門、鎖箱子、抵制日貨、是我們民族僅存的武器、不能聽少數人擺佈、輕易的斷送掉、在抗日會最後辦法還没有决定之前、（上面所說的草案、已經暫時擱起、）我們大家應該起來嚴密的監督他們、各團體更應該有嚴重的表示、</p>
<p>▲附記　散賣制的流弊、大家都知道、不是有利可圖的人、不會主張散賣、就是集中公賣、也得有一個妥當的辦法、萬萬不可以把所有的存貨、儘量賣出去、我是主張分期出賣的解法、現在把我寫給抗日會的信節録一叚如下、</p>
<p>「……查曆次抵制日貨失敗之原因即誤於已進日貨之無限制發賣、在抵制期内雷厲風行、日貨來源、暫時斷絶、但市面存貨尚多、可供一時之需、（每次抵貨前、商人即提早趕進大批日貨、幾月内不愁無貨可賣）至存貨將清時、抵制已無形取銷、又可大進日貨、以補市面日貨之缺、此所以抵貨前日貨輸入必大增、抵制後日貨輸入亦必大增、以長期觀之、日貨輸入固未嘗减於平時也、……如本次封存之貨、能保存至抵制完了時、再提出發賣、則彼時市面日貨驟增、無須再從日方大批補進、而抵制期内、日貨絶跡於市場其銷路爲西洋貨或國貨所奪、日人此種損失、無從取償、如此抵制一年即有一年之效果、抵制二的即有二年之效果、不至如往次之完全落空也、即爲顧全商家成本計抵制前所進之貨、不能永遠封存、萬不得已、亦有折衷辦法、豈可貿然將封存之貨傾卸市面、斷送抵貨運動之前途、鄙人對於封存之貨處置辦法、曾擬有二策、（一）半年後集中公開發賣並許商人以此項存貨做押欵、（二）有限制的發賣譬如平時可經一月之貨、分四月出售、每月售去四分之一、如此日貨銷場、有四分之三爲他國貨所奪、第二法似尤易實行、……」</p>

<p>清光緒七八年間。法人欲實行紅河通商。時有黑旗黨魁劉永福者。名義。故太平軍驍將也。籍廣東欽州。齠龄時。飄泊於外。旅居滇越之交。曁長。行商於越南。恒往來宣光安平間。慷慨散財。結衆得死力之士。都數百人。會有匪氛飈起。侵略及興化之保勝。興化當道。慕永福豪士往平之。遂駐剳保勝。嗣爲越王聞。以永福積功。命爲三省（宣光興化山西）副提督。并畀以守土之責。軍門馮子材至越。與永福爲同鄉。見其意志雄俊。將携之歸國。或傳馮曾授以五品頂戴。然已授官任事。倚畀方隆。竟不果。</p>
<p>永福爲提督。得自行收稅以贍軍食。法人於是以有礙商務爲口實。迭陷河内等地。永福所駐山西軍。絶悍。又得滇督岑毓英以軍火資之。故與法戰。屢以大捷聞於朝。法人懼。别以兵陷我。越亦來乞援。乃命李少荃督師援之。實先至天津。已與法使賓海訂約矣。時彭玉麟督辦廣東海防外。滇撫唐炯駐山西。桂撫徐廷旭駐北甯。皆革職逮問。永福亦兵潰。法水師總兵福祿諾。將驅逐黑旗軍。而少荃含之。不以上奏。嗣永福受清廷招撫。亦以提督記名。又攻復三省焉。時議者謂「南詔之事。旣不可爲。敗則爲法人所殲。勝且爲中將所忌。進退狼狽。有竊爲永福寒心者。」亦匪無見。</p>
<p>嗚呼。永福以一覊旅孤軍。獨張義幟。</p>

<p>— 大維</p>
<p>最近到鄉間去。一羣人圍住我問時事。我說「國要亡了」。他們說。「大水已退了。今年田稻收成還不錯。怎麽會亡國」。</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>大都會的學生們閙罷課。小城市的商店閙罷市。前者要逼着當局者去救國。後者逼着當局者不許救國。</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>「你們要抵制日貨。日本自然要出兵來打。老虎頭上去抓癢。自作自受」。一個年老者洋洋自得的在敎訓着。我恍然亡國之根源了。</p>
<p>對抗法軍。以區區數千甫集之衆。屢挫强敵。斬將塞旗。追奔逐北。使海内稍有血氣者。靡不聞風興起。此實邊事以來所未有也。迺清廷非之。不疑其徼倖圖功。則飾其傳聞非實。侈言誇大。有類張皇。故永福處中法之役。可勝而不可敗。能進而不能退。是無異棄雄才大略。而委之於虎口。坐視其亡。而莫之能援。當時有心人謂「此可爲天下人才一哭者。」良匪誣也。余幼時。聞永福名。耳爲之震。蓋不亞於今之馬將軍。滬上攝影術。故未盛行。而西人所製。得以家懸户貼者。舍曾左李外。唯永福一人而已。觀其狀貌。年未踰五十。髭猶未茁。一如美少年。質弱。而眉宇間露英英之爽。初意爲魁偉奇碩。有非若恒流者。而不謂天挺之人傑。固非所測焉。雖然。吾思劉永福之時與勢。及其地位之艱且困。愈不能不慮夫爲今之馬將軍已。噫。</p>
<h3 id="c175">記行色匆匆之網球花馬迪夫人 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>轟動一時的美國網球皇后馬迪夫人。一度來滬。竟因身體略有不適而並未知上海的網球選手作公開的表演。說起了馬迪夫人。伊的臉上。時常表露着一種微笑而伊的舉動。又非常的莊重美雅。神經和體魄。都充滿了一種鐵血質。所以伊的氣力。在表演網球的時候。不拘在任何壓力之下。不會枯竭的那的確是一件難能的事。伊現在雖已嫁了。但人們看見了伊。都以爲伊是一個大學校的女生而還保留着伊那處女美。</p>
<p>馬迪夫人這次到上海來。在伊的心理。似乎對於上海這個地方。很是歡喜。所以上岸以後。面上便始終堆滿了微笑。所見的一切。似乎也都足使伊驚奇遠東的神秘。</p>
<p>馬迪夫人網球技術的成就。和歷來所得錦標的繁多。恐怕誰都及不上伊。在女子隊伍裏面表演網球的時候。手法純熟。氣力充足。當伊在少女時代。還没有想到結婚的時候。那時年紀很輕。有一天。伊竟一個人出去。和一個新得錦標的網球女名將表演。也絶無驚慌的色彩。那一</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>四以國聯的用人行政而言。也絶不平等。國聯共設三大機關。（一）秘書廳（二）國際法庭三國際勞工局。這三大機關的職員。據說有千餘人。英法籍最多。我國人在秘書廳中只有四人。地位並不重要。勞工局無一人。國際法庭。只有王寵惠一人。比較重要些。日本人也很多。且有各部長等要缺。最可惜者。有時國聯對中國事有所諮詢。每向日本人探問。日人藉此鼓其如　之舌。作種種反宣傳。眞是滑稽之至。</p>
<p>我國對國聯所盡的義務。和各國同一比例。而所享權利獨利獨少。這種不平等的現象政府應當提出抗議。</p>
<p>我們早該知道國聯爲不可靠。不應至今才知道。更不該在日本這樣嚴重的武力壓迫之下。而仍畏首畏尾。以國聯爲泰山之靠。所以外交以至一敗塗地。如今主張退出國聯的人很多。其實以目前情勢論。亦有不可即時退出的理由。</p>
<p>（甲）按國聯盟約所規定。凡會員國欲自行退出者。須於兩年前預先通告。不得臨時决定。</p>
<p>（乙）在退出前。須將其對於國聯的義務。履行完竣。如會費一項。我國尚積欠很多。義務未完即不能退出。</p>
<p>照此情形。果然不能退出。即使能退出。我以爲也不必退出了。我國在國際間更孤立了。而日本更可以恣意横行。肆無忌憚。像最近幾次大會。日本代表在大庭廣衆之間。往往理屈詞窮。騰美萬邦。雖然他實際無損。顔面究竟難堪。而况我國向來缺乏國際宣傳的利器。此次東省事變。大半還因國聯的存在。集中世界各國的視聽。而事實得大白於天下。所以說加入國聯。於我們固然無利。退出國聯。於日本更有利。這就是我對於不必退出國聯的管見。但經此一番大挫折。我們對於國聯的觀念。應當大改變。而且從此以後。要知道如何去充分利用國聯。才不枉每年担負這樣巨額的會費。</p>
<p>次的表演。的確得到了不少經騐。伊所以能夠獲得世界網球錦標。也許因爲伊有大無畏的精神。總而言之。伊的球藝。現在已到達了最高的限度了。</p>
<p>馬迪夫人的成功。一半當然要歸功於伊的天賦。伊的美貌。伊的勇氣。伊的聰明。當伊表演的時候。能夠抵禦有力的來球。並可報以更有力的回球。反抽尤其得手。在草地的上面。伊委實好比一陣旋風。而且態度始終安閒。絶無困頓的色彩。這次在日本也打敗了不少網球名手。上海的球迷。不能賞伊的球藝。眞是可惜呢。</p>

<p>— 青年援馬團一團員</p>
<p>（四）離南翔</p>
<p>今天絶早。（十一日）微微地聞得緊急集合號。同志們便都很矯捷地醒覺。爭相走到召集地。接受團長的動員令。没多時。我們一切都預備好了。便向崑山進發。這時候。陽光猶未照臨大地。枯黄的路草。被一夜寒露摧殘。若不勝其勞頓者。然而。回顧國内。勢頓的狀態更甚於路草。我的内心於是傷感莫名</p>
<p>中午行抵安亭。蒙三縣鄉村師範招待。並由團長在歡迎會上向各界致謝。及演述此行意旨。午膳後。望西出發。</p>
<p>到了崑山時。縣黨部及各界都派有代表在車站迎接。站上及路上掛着很大的白布横條。都是寫着歡迎或贊頌我們的標語。晚上在縣立中學住宿。</p>
<p>這裏風景很好。路政也好。風俗尤爲樸實。土人們見了我們那具團員總靈的棺柩。莫不驚訝私語。有些明瞭我們殲日决心的老幼男女。見了這具可怖的東西。越覺悲不可抑。頻頻以手帕拭涙。</p>
<p>軍中的生活。很别有風味。我們毫不覺其苦。反因而胃口大增。多吃幾碗粗飯。</p>

<p>第四章　大義滅親</p>
<p>萬里赴戎機。關山度若飛。朔氣傳金柝。寒光照鐵衣。此情此」</p>
<p>景。忠淑已感受到了。不料彭梅國的軍隊到了Ｌ江畔。對面Ｈ省的防軍已將江橋毁斷。湯湯流水。十分遼闊。一時不能飛渡過去。祗得暫且紮下營寨再說。彭梅國的司令部設在離江橋十里多路的一個天道村裏。彭梅國在晚上和參謀長及太陽國軍官談了長時間的話。有些疲乏了。正要安睡。却見他女兒忠淑從外邊　入。梅國問道。天氣很冷。朔風甚大。你爲何此時還没睡覺。忠淑道。華乃强有機密事奉告父親。梅國微笑道。他有什麽機。……正說到機字。密字還未出口。華乃强已自外一躍而入。手中高擎手槍。瞄準了彭梅國喝道。賣國賊不許動。彭梅國那裏料到有這麽一著。早已嚇得呆了。此時華乃强凛若天人。又說道。賣國賊。你昏庸至此。對得起國家。對得起同胞麽。出此無名之師。爲虎作倀。良心都喪盡了。我爲國家而來。要處置你的死刑。今天是你的末日了。彭梅國大驚。方欲高聲呼喊。祗聽槍聲一響。彭梅國已倒在血沿中了。外面兩個護兵聞聲而入。却被華乃强一槍一個。都了結了。回頭瞧忠淑時。見伊已伏在那老賊身上。嚶嚶而泣。乃强不覺對伊跪了下去道。女士請恕。我不得已而　此。現在請止悲泣。我們須要商量善後辦法爲要。忠淑措着眼涙。立起來道。我早已同意。此事爲國爲民。於君何尤。我祇痛惜我父親昏庸老悖。受人利用。綫有今日的結果。我做了他的女兒。不能勸他回心。止住他的賣國行爲。使我深自悲傷的。唉我旣不能爲沈雲英。又不能爲苟灌娘。還有什麽說話呢。現在一切之事。都照乃强兄以前商定的主張進行便了。華乃强也不由仰天嘆了一口氣。此時胡馬嘶風。刀斗聲寂。眼前的景狀祇有嚴肅。燈光也黯黯不明。二人植立在那裏。都受到一種特殊的感覺。</p>

<p>— 芝音女士</p>
<p>兩次都見到廣告、說有一位西班牙享有世界盛名的提琴名手在滬演奏、第一次我没有去、第二次却去了、但又已客滿、第三次、我在八點半鐘就獨自趕去、結果還是白跑、因爲我没有定座、票子又没有了、但我决計等一下、看看動靜再說、果然、有許多與我同樣没有定座的外國人也在等着要票子、於是就有一個中國賣票人走進票洞去、開始發賣立票、在每一張戲票存根上簽一個Stand、我也這樣的買了一張立票、</p>
<p>招待是外國少女、年可十八九、好像是俄羅斯人、穿着樸素的土黄色上衣、圍着青黑色而緊窄的小裙、</p>
<p>我是站在最末的座後的欄杆邊、欄杆就權當椅子、有許多後來的立票的外國人、中國人、想搶我這一個位子都搶不到呢、我是從進去到完畢都没有離開這裏、少女來去招待着、有時碰到我的身體、則我可以聽到一聲尖小而輕清的Sorry、同時又可以看到一瞬和謁的笑容、</p>
<p>也有臃腫而肥碩的老婦、也有大腹便便的財主、手指上有金色的戒指的閃光、肚皮上掛着黄金的表鏈、大部份的年青女子、則有的是雪白而高大的皮領、黑色而發光的大衣、大衣下晚禮服的長長的衣角、飄飄地拖在地上、西洋人對於無論任何樣藝術是很尊重的、你看、他們是赴音樂會、而穿的都是挺挺的禮服、也有滿頭披着長髮的青年男子、帶着好像有無限思索的目光、想要探求什麽似的、但這大半是中國人、</p>
<p>幾個臃腫的外國太太走進來、一個少年從座上立起來招呼、外國太太伸出她們皺紋的手、少年在每隻手上接吻、</p>
<p>我的表針指上九時二十分、全塲的燈光統統滅息、臺前的電光分外明亮、于是一切聽響都没有、空氣完全肅靜、肅靜到連呼吸的聲音都覺得不敢舒暢、我全被這個肅靜屏息得不敢透氣、</p>
<p>海飛士Heifetz左手握了梵亞鈴、右手執着弓（Bow）、從台左走出來、後面還有兩個人同時走出來、全場就蒲蒲鼓掌一番、三個都穿了燕尾禮服、深深地向臺下行了個九十度敬禮、</p>
<p>臺面是非常之高、後面是懸了一大塊灰色的幕片、一架鋼琴、一架椅子、都壁靜的早已安置着、電光射到鋼琴面、再由鋼琴面射到人們的眼廉、這簡直是一張圖畫、一張清雅而美的圖案畫、</p>
<p>海飛士是一位矮小的中年人、頭髮很少、我是離得太遠了、不能看得清楚、深深的目光、是温雅而和平、舉止、則完全是整齊的九十度的直角體、與鐵　的晚禮服、</p>
<p>彈鋼琴者年已半百、髮似花白、灣着腰、駝着背、右足踏着音瓣、左足閒放在後邊成人字形、而目光是注視着琴譜、正在等待着海飛士的演奏令、而在他的意識裏、則似乎並不知道有現象底、</p>
<p>再一個人則是爲奏鋼琴者揭樂譜、</p>
<p>一點也没有什麽自動、</p>
<p>先發音的是鋼琴、繼之而才是絲絲的梵亞鈴、</p>
<p>全塲裏完全是靜靜靜、除音樂而外、誰都不敢放出些兒聲響、</p>
<p>開頭第一曲是斐多汾的第九交響樂、鋼琴和着梵亞鈴混合伴奏、由緩靜而急促、而光細、而敏疾……於是乎全室中在一波一動的震蕩裏、一切的感情都被吸引着、立時可使你忘記了自已、失了知覺、心爲它而跳動、面爲它而發燒、有時是極尖銳到聽不出聲音、而你正是屏息得不能透氣、情感是被衝動到最高點、</p>
<p>曲分三小段、每段略定幾分鐘、定後休息、門外又站着許多後來的觀客、一部份人再絡續的走出去、大蓋他們是太窒息了、透空氣去、聲音依舊很靜、全没有戲院裏的那種噪音、後來的人走進來、一點也没有聲音、女的是巓起脚尖走的、而男的啦、走起來也全不曾聽到有些聲音、於是我這才注意到是不是他們穿了橡皮跟的皮鞋呢、</p>
<p>休息、一共是兩次、到第三次音樂開塲是一幽靜的調子、但或者是被一種先入心理所朦朧的關係、我覺得、總之、三場音樂第一塲的感覺最好、印象最深、</p>
<p>每一個曲完了就有一片鼓聲、鼓掌是接連不斷、於是海飛士與那位奏鋼琴的同出來再向聽衆行幾個最敬禮、有時是海飛士一久出來、有時的禮、形式像一條蛇、把頭向下急速的點下去、再向上漸漸的抬起來、同時身體也這樣的曲一曲、有時要海飛土出來行兩次最敬禮、然後掌聲才能休止、</p>
<p>最末曲奏完了、海飛士與鋼琴師又走進去、我不知道是不是定塲了呢、看節目已是完了、但人們一個都没有起動、掌聲仍是鼓噪着、於是魚飛士與奏琴者就再上臺、這或者是他們西洋的慣態、曲終了可以要求分外再聽一曲的、</p>
<p>梵亞鈴輕快清脆的調子又奏了一曲、我隨即把大衣披好、但人們依舊還未起動、掌聲仍是繼續不絶、在前排右邊的一個外國青年男子的掌聲、正震得我耳朶將聾、有幾個中國女人已罪立起來、我幾個外國人是走到門口、有幾個人是已走了出去、</p>
<p>海飛士又出來行個禮、九十度禮、蛇形的禮、然後再軋上梵亞鈴、以細長的弓加上絃線、這或許是個小曲兒罷、一種完全是輕清、浮動的音階、</p>
<p>又是一陣掌聲、難着一種浮燥的呌喊、喊的是英語、是再來一個的意思、有幾個中國人也在喊、喊得與外國人一色一樣、</p>
<p>前排的人們都已立起來、繼之、就是中排的人、我馬上也立起身來、</p>
<p>在縱横的汽車與汽車中間穿過、夜已十二時了、</p>

<h3 id="c180">堂倌 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 澄</p>
<p>那時差不多是四時了、我和彬和新三人、偶然走過城隍廟、新於是提議、「我們好久没有吃素的炒麵了、去吃一頓好嗎、反正現在也是吃點心的時候了、」</p>
<p>「好、好、」我和彬都贊成、覺得眞的、和葷炒麵一樣鮮美的素炒麵、我們是好久没有嘗到了、同時、肚了内也轆轆的有些餓了、三個人不約而同的往×××的方向走去、</p>
<p>×××的菜、聽說較别處淡而鮮、</p>
<p>而且盛的菜也不是淺淺的、所以我們在志隍廟裏、遇到想吃素菜素麵時、必到×××去吃的、雖城隍廟裏的素菜館很多、</p>
<p>我們緩緩地走上×××菜館的樓、見吃的人並不多、於是很隨便的在靠窗的一隻桌邊坐下、</p>
<p>一個很肥胖的堂倌、見我們坐下了、很急的走上前來、把他肩上的一塊白布、在桌上拂了幾拂、於是一邊拿出筷子來、一邊很有禮似的說、「小姐、要甚麽菜、」</p>
<p>「一隻炒、…」我方慢吞吞的在說、新阻止了、「我們祇要兩盆三鮮炒麵好了、」</p>
<p>那個肥胖的堂倌、聽了兩盆炒麵、便回轉身、走到梯子那面、高喊着我們的要的、</p>
<p>他喊完後、倒了三杯茶來、這時、他可没有先前那樣高興、他差不多是板着臉的、把三杯茶放在桌上走了、</p>
<p>彬拿了一杯、擎起了說、「你們看、這茶裏有很多的汚屑、我要去換杯白開水吃了、你們可也要嗎、」</p>
<p>我和新摇摇頭、說、「我們茶和開水都不要、」</p>
<p>彬於是把手一揚、向着站在一偶的那個肥胖的堂倌說、「來、換一杯茶、」</p>
<p>「甚麽、」他很不高興的站在他面前、</p>
<p>「這茶很龌龊、去換杯開水、」</p>
<p>「開水和這杯茶一樣的、因爲這茶也</p>
<p>是拿開水來冲的、」他做出一般不屑狀、兩手垂在兩旁、並不表示想去換一杯的樣子、他的態度很冷的、一動不動的望着彬、</p>
<p>「那末你不要管他一樣不一樣、總之你去換一杯開水便了、」我微怒着說、他斜了我一眼、也微怒似的、拿那杯茶倒在我們桌邊的痰盂裏後、然後快快的走去、</p>
<p>「這種堂倌眞勢利、他起先以爲我們是大吃客、所以招待得很客氣、待一知我們祇吃一二盆炒麵、便大失所望的做出這種輕蔑我們的態度了、」彬說着、</p>
<p>「我們雖不怕他的白眼、但我想我們也得炒幾隻菜來吃吃、怎樣、」我說着、當我想到我們是難得走過城隍廟的、</p>
<p>「好的、那末你愛吃甚麽菜、……炒山藥你們喜歡不喜歡、」新望着我們、</p>
<p>我們點定了幾隻菜、於是新招着手高喊着、「來、」這次、那堂倌大概已知道我們要喚幾隻菜了吧、他似乎不像方才那樣若露着鄙薄我們之色了、</p>
<p>「再炒幾隻菜、一隻炒山藥、一隻炒菜心、一隻炒什錦、半買的好了、」堂倌稍稍露出些微笑、連連點着頭說、「有數、有數、」這時的他、到似乎很恭敬我們了、</p>
<p>菜一隻隻的拿來、我們也一隻隻的吃、彬的胃口最小、他第一個停了吃、坐在旁邊等等我們、那時、這肥胖的堂倌又來了、摇擺着、他先授給彬一把熱蒸蒸的手巾接着說、「開水還要嗎、」他的平和了的態度和言語、似乎在要求恕他方才的魯莽、</p>
<p>都吃好後、我們喚他算錢、「三角一、四角八、五角三、…………連小賬共大洋二元三角半、」他算得很敏捷、</p>
<p>我們付了他二元四角、其餘的錢不要他找了、他謙恭地說着、「小姐、謝謝你們、」當我們整齊了衣服、開始走下樓梯的時候、</p>
<p>「這種卑賤的人的多得了幾個錢、眞像貪食的狗的在陌生人手中得到了一塊牛肉、便會摇頭擺尾的顯殷勤的、」新慨嘆着、在走出了×××以後、</p>
<p>「唉、其實人何苦做金錢的奴隸、有了金錢、定同時也得到煩惱的、剛才的那個堂倌謝我們、我們祇冷冷的頭也不回的當做没曾聽見、試想、這也不是結他難堪的嗎、」</p>
<p>「但你不知他願意有難堪、而不願不得到金錢嗎、」我說着、一邊到也很同情堂倌、因他原是這種人呢、祇有得金錢、甚麽都願意受、那個人是離了金錢而挣扎的呢、</p>

<p>政治是維持社會秩序的機關、如果政治成績是善良的、則人類生活得以安定、如其是不良的、則人類生活陷於尀難苦、由是而社會的進步發展亦因以妨碍、馴至滅亡其國、亦不可知、由此可見欲使社會的秩序得以安甯、非有好的政治組織不可、倘有欲研究世界大勢或社會關係者、尤非熟諳各國的政治組織不可、歷年以來、世界各國的政治組織、跟着歷史的變遷而變更成各式的制度、二十年紀是物質文明、科學文化的中心時代、政治的方式是值得注意的、尤其處在中國的現狀之下、外患緊逼而來、國内政治依舊、窳敗、返觀世界各國隨着環境而刻下在更改着他們的政治組織、的確足以使得我們作爲「他山之助」的、於是我來介紹這本書便成爲有意義了、</p>
<p>本書由劉伯閔君編譯、裏面包括世界六十餘國的政情、從國體、政體、議會制、選舉制、司法機關、行政機關以至地方制度、觕備梗概、足供一般備檢之用、本書非僅述其國内之政治狀態、并附帶的述及國體成立的歷史、讀者自能從一種因果關係上找出線索來、並不像普通一般書的直叙記載法、本書完全用經緯的方法、頭頭是道的說來、使讀者能一貫讀之、非特明瞭其國内的政治組織而已、并能相當瞭然到那國爲了什麽要如是的組織、並對於世界各國的關係、</p>
<p>往往我們在報上、看見了某一國的政體有所變更、在腦子裏不過有一個淡薄影像而已、不致再研究到旁的問題上去其實一國政治組織的變動並非偶然的、乃是必然的、我們倘使能瞭解其現在的政治組織、則决不會疑心到將來的變動是飛來的、所以、在現在的時代經濟的不景氣、革命高潮的飛漲、當局往往無法維持現狀、而政治組織也就瞬息萬變的現在、能分一點神、來看一看現在世界各國的政治組織、尤其是一種刻不容緩的事、</p>
<p>如這次東省事件、國人大半還不能明瞭這次事變是何人主動、或者不明白日本究竟如何通過此種議案的、這實在也因爲不明白日本國的政治組織、因此或許會誤會到是南陸相的一意孤行、或是金谷參謀長的計劃、若一觀本書則可完全明瞭、書中對於日本政治的組織、分析詳明、如天皇、諮詢機關、内大臣、樞密院、内閣、帷幄上奏機關、國會、等之相互關係及任務、均分别述明、不致使讀者觀了政治的某種變態之後、而誤會是政潮中的偶然的微泡、而可實際地瞭解到那事態的由來、背景和趨勢、</p>
<p>本書分七編、蓋編總論述（一）人類的生活和政治、（二）政治之歷史之變遷、（三）各國政治的概况、内係述明要使政治善良、生活安定、須各個人能理解政治、并說到因爲人人希望有善良的政治、安定的生活、因此方發生了屢次的政治變遷、次再述及世界政治的概况、作者說、「我們考覈從來的政治過程、發生了幾多的失敗、經過了幾多不合理的政治、到現在似乎是進到了若干的進步的政治、」又說「歐洲在大戰以後、共和國新增至十四國、比之十二國的君主國是占多數、現在世界的共和國已經有了三十九國、比之世界的國數、占了六成以上、回顧百年或二百年以前的政治情况、不能不說是發生了極大的變化、」這種歷史的統計便顯出了本書的特點、知道作者在如何苦心的在希望着「除舊更新」啊、所以本書除給與讀者以影像外、并能給讀者以興奮、至可能不覺得他在記賬式的叙述、而使人能有興趣的讀下去、第二編歐羅巴洲、第三編亞細亞洲、第四編北阿美利加洲、第五編南阿美利加洲、第六编大洋洲、第七編阿非利加洲、而獨有中國、這就因本國的人民總能知道自已的政治組織了、同時也就是給本國人民以一種暗示、因爲使我們看得别國好的政治的組織、而能將本國的政治有所改革、近聞我國之政治組織、又欲稍有變更、願閱者先來一讀是書、然後對於本國的政治有所認識并有所貢獻、亦實爲當今之急務、</p>
<p>觀了本書、便能完全知道了世界各國現在的政治組織的狀態、但是將來又是怎樣的呢、這當然也爲我們所急於要知道的、本書也曾附帶了一些引子、因爲他的話是如此的正確而有力、故我不厭多贅、介紹於此、他說、「歐洲諸國、無論君主國或共和國、都是社會問題極繁複的國家、即在政治上、已經發生了顯著的表面化這等國家、其政治的活動率以社會黨及與社會黨有關係的黨占有强大的勢力、這就是表出政治的民衆化方進未已的現象、比之二十世紀初的政治狀態、已經是激進的變化了、政治上的大目的在於社會政策的實施早於識者所見及、纔免得於今日逐次實現、努力完成社會政策、安定多數民衆生活、實爲當今最要的急務……」所以我們知道政治的趨向逐漸在向進他的路上走、但是本國的政治則應以如何的方法使其進步、則是大堪研究的事、願讀者能先一讀是書藉以知道世界的政治是進於若何的狀况、然後進而推求到本國政治的改進、或許比較能深刻而實際一些吧、</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Army Ministry and the General Staff Headquarters held a joint meeting last night to discuss the operational plan. At 7:00 PM today, Chief of Staff Kanaya telegraphed Commander Honjo, deciding that from tomorrow morning (today), the Qiqihar XX Regiment will move to Zhengjiatun. The troops in Jilin and Changchun will move south at 3:30 PM today, concentrating along the South Manchurian Railway line. The troops in Sipingjie will move south along the Manchurian Railway line to Yingkou, and then from Yingkou to Jinzhou. Preparations for a general attack have been completed, and the situation in various places is extremely tense. (20th, Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese army plans to launch a large-scale suppression of bandits in Southern Manchuria starting tomorrow morning. It is expected that Jinzhou will be occupied around Christmas. Tonight, the Honjo Headquarters claimed that the bandit suppression plan has been agreed upon. It is planned to dispatch Japanese troops from Changchun, Shenyang, Yingkou, and the areas along the Beining and Sitao Railways at dawn on Sunday. All are preparing to attack tonight. According to the Japanese military headquarters, at 8:00 AM this morning, a team from the Yingkou Japanese garrison fought with 2,000 Chinese soldiers between Panshan and Tianzhuangtai. One Japanese soldier was killed and two were injured. At 10:00 AM, a team of troops was sent from Yingkou to the front line to assist in the battle. Shenyang predicts that if the Japanese army launches a general attack on Jinzhou, it will be around Christmas. The Japanese authorities have sent a special committee to warn Rong Zhen, the commander of the Chinese army in the area, to lead his troops into the pass, otherwise they will be driven out by force. Yesterday, Japanese troops in Changchun, Gongzhuling, and Sipingjie began to attack bandits concentrated in Huai'de, and three airplanes took off from Changchun and dropped bombs on a large group of scattered soldiers in Xijiatunzi (transliteration), west of Huai'de. According to news from the Tokyo Army Ministry, the Japanese army in the three northeastern provinces has completed the final preparations for attacking Jinzhou. According to the plan of the General Staff, the Japanese army in Qiqihar has now opened to Zhengjiatun and will advance at the same time as the Japanese army in Jilin, Changchun, and other places. The Japanese army in Sipingjie will first go to Yingkou, and then attack westward. Last night, officials from the Army Ministry and the General Staff Headquarters met again in Tokyo to discuss the Jinzhou attack marching plan. It is said that Honjo has received important instructions from Tokyo. (20th, Guomin News Agency)</p>

<p>British Military Attaché Questions Honjo</p>
<p>Honjo Admits to Attacking Jinzhou Without Concealment</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The tracks of the Tianzhuangtai-Yingkou Railway, which were previously destroyed by the Japanese army, were repaired again by Japanese soldiers under supervision on the afternoon of the 20th. Three trains are parked at Yingkou Station, with locomotives firing up, which is expected to be in preparation for attacking Jinzhou. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Hearing that the Japanese army was preparing to attack Jinzhou, the British military attaché went to Liaoning to question Honjo. The Council of the League of Nations resolved that during the period before the investigation team arrives in the Northeast, both China and Japan should contain the expansion of the incident. Is it true that the Japanese army is attacking Jinzhou? Honjo replied, "It is true. The Chinese army in Jinzhou is moving frequently and shows signs of taking active action against Japan. Therefore, the Japanese army has no choice but to attack Jinzhou." The British military attaché said that he had been stationed in Jinzhou for a month and had not seen or heard of any Chinese troop movements. He then asked if Japan had an ultimatum, limiting the Chinese army to retreat into the pass. Honjo replied, "Yes." The British military attaché has telegraphed the questions and answers to the British ambassador to report to his government. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Shenyang) Colonel Sanghill, the military attaché of the British Embassy in Beiping, arrived here from Jinzhou and said that the news of the Chinese soldiers' actions in Jinzhou was completely unfounded. In the past three weeks, the spokesman of the Japanese authorities here has repeatedly published various news about the Chinese soldiers' heavy concentration in the Jinzhou area. When asked about this matter by Colonel Sanghill, he replied that the unfounded rumors were not credible. Chinese soldiers have not been increased, and the deployment of troops in the middle of last month has not changed.

<p>The Army Ministry Has Officially Announced</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tokyo Electric, after the Northeast Incident, Japan has repeatedly sent a large number of troops from Korea and domestically to the Eastern Provinces.

<p>Undersecretary of State Expresses Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>But Denies That He Has Submitted a Note</p>
<p>(Washington) The news of the Japanese army's attack on Jinzhou has once again attracted great attention here. The United States has issued a second note to Japan, telling it that the United States will regard Japan's occupation of Jinzhou as a very unfortunate event. (19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the Japanese army's active attack on Jinzhou, the United States Undersecretary of State Kesert issued a statement, saying that if the Japanese army really implements the occupation of Jinzhou, the temporary capital of Manchuria, the United States government and the League of Nations will regard it as a very unfortunate event. Mr. Kesert said that this attitude of the United States has long been expressed by the US Ambassador Forbes to the Tokyo government, but recently the United States has absolutely not submitted any note to the Japanese government. Furthermore, the Japanese army disregarded the opposition of the United States and the protests of the Geneva Peace Organization and resolutely sent troops to attack Jinzhou. What steps will the United States and the League of Nations take to resist? At present, Kesert does not want to discuss this question. The reports from all sides prove that the Japanese army is actively preparing for war. Unless all the Chinese troops on the Beining Line withdraw into the pass, it is difficult to avoid the Japanese army's attack on Jinzhou. However, Mr. Kesert still stated, as Secretary of State Stimson announced yesterday, that the United States has not instructed Ambassador Forbes to Japan to submit any written or oral opinions to the Japanese government in the past few weeks.

<p>(Nanjing) The First Plenary Session was originally scheduled to hold an opening ceremony first on the 21st, and then hold a formal meeting after all the committee members from the north and south arrived. However, because the two batches of Central Committee members from Guangdong will not be able to arrive on the 21st, and although Wang's illness has recovered recently, the doctor's advice is still not suitable for travel, and Sun is still not out of bed, it was decided to postpone the opening ceremony to the morning of the 22nd, and a formal meeting will be held in the afternoon. A conversation meeting will be held at the official residence of the Railway Department on the morning of the 21st. Some of the Central Committee members in Nanjing from Ning and Yue, and the Central Committee members who arrived in Beijing today, will meet to exchange various opinions. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the opinions of the Central Committee members, the proposals of the First Plenary Session tend to focus on the overall situation, and the resolutions of the Shanghai Peace Conference are generally unchanged, but specific methods should be discussed as soon as possible. The proposal for the National Salvation Conference initiated by Wang Jingwei and the National Disaster Conference resolved by the Fourth National Congress will be discussed together first, and decisions will be made after considering the essence of the two proposals. As for the important candidates for the unified government, only the Chairman and members of the National Government, as well as the heads of the five yuan, will be elected by the plenary session. The heads of various ministries and commissions will be decided by the Standing Committee. Wang Zhaoming, Lin Sen, Cai Yuanpei, and Jiang Zhongzheng have the highest calls for the chairmanship of the National Government. It is also heard that Sun Ke will take office as the President of the Executive Yuan, and Hu Hanmin will still be the head of the Legislative, Supervisory, Judicial, and Examination Yuan without change. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Faqin said that the important responsibility of the party is to lead the people. At present, there are not many party departments in various places that can cooperate closely with the people. The party is the party, and the people are the people, as if they have nothing to do with each other. The people do not know what the party is. This phenomenon urgently needs to be reformed. Not only should the party lead the people, but it should also truly cooperate with the people, so that the party can be trusted by the people and the Three Principles of the People can be deeply imprinted in the minds of the people, then the party affairs can naturally be on the road to promotion from soundness. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The meeting place for the plenary meeting of the Central Committee is in the first conference hall of the Central Party Department. It has been arranged today. The party and national flags and the Prime Minister's portrait are hung on the rostrum. The front row is the chairman's seat, with one seat for the secretary-general and four seats for the secretary. The rear row is the seat for the presidium, and the seat for the stenographer is under the rostrum. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tan Zhen, Zhang Zhiben, Zhao Zhonglian, Cheng Qian, Li Liejun, Chen Jiayou, Shi Ying, Miao Bin, Liu Yazi, and Fang Shengtao, a group of ten people from Ning who were elected as alternate supervisors of the Fourth National Congress, arrived in Beijing by car at 4:00 PM today and stayed at the Central Hotel. When Central Committee member Li Liejun arrived in Beijing, he told people that the nine proposals put forward by the Shanghai Peace Conference, such as being firm and unyielding externally, respecting public opinion internally, guaranteeing human rights, and carrying out constitutionalism, seem to be fundamental blueprints. When the plenary session opens, we should still select the important ones and re-propose them for adoption. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo told reporters that the party's grassroots work is for ordinary party members to go deep into the people and provide guidance at any time and anywhere to instill knowledge into the people. There is no need for public activities, and there is no need to establish an衙門-style party department for the convenience of a few members. Second, the personnel system should have effective guarantees. When government officials are transferred, administrative officials should not be replaced easily if they have not made any mistakes, so that civil servants can serve with peace of mind, concentrate their talents, and devote themselves to their duties. Third, the period of political tutelage does not need to be clearly defined in theory, but democratic politics must be actively implemented. If the majority of the people can exercise their political power, constitutional government can be carried out. Fourth, mass movements must have motives. Restrictions and safeguards should be weighed according to the appropriateness of their motives, but in general, they must be led properly to avoid losing their rational function and overstepping the norm.

<p>(Nanjing) Slogans welcoming Wang are hung all over the thoroughfare. It was rumored yesterday that Wang would enter Beijing tonight. According to reliable news, Wang must meet with the second batch of Yue committee members who arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 21st before coming to Beijing. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Previously, Wang entrusted Sun Ke to ask Jiang to find a way to remedy the problem of the ten Central Committee members elected in Shanghai. It is now reliable news that Ning can be recognized conditionally, saying that the Fourth Central Committee was originally scheduled to elect 24 members from Ning and Yue each. Now Yue has added 10 members elected in Shanghai, except for Zhang Fakui, there are actually nine people. Ning will also have to add the same number of Central Committee members as a counterweight. If this proposal is approved by Yue, the new Ning committee members will be filled in order according to the number of votes not elected before. A certain central committee member insisted on this point especially vigorously. After the Lizi Society banquet the night before, Jiang and Chen Bijun talked for a long time and asked Chen to transfer the discussion to Wang, and don't think about things on one side, because Wang once said that the problem of the ten Shanghai committee members cannot be properly resolved, and he will never come to Beijing. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Bai Yunti said that in the problem of Mongolia and Tibet, in the midst of external insults, regarding the national defense equipment, consolidating the borders, revitalizing reclamation and mining to ensure people's livelihood, and various important policies of appeasement and comfort, facilities are urgently needed. I will make a proposal on this in the plenary session. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee members in Shanghai, Li Liejun, Cheng Qian, Tan Zhen, Fang Zhenwu, Fang Shengtao, Xiong Kewu, Shi Ying, Zhang Zhiben, Chuan Rulin, Chen Jiayou, Xue Dubi, and attendants, etc., arrived in Beijing at 4:00 PM and stayed at the Overseas Chinese Guest House. The attendants lived in the Central Hotel. (20th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shang Zhen and Miao Peicheng arrived in Beijing from Ping by Ford plane at about 2:00 PM on the morning of the 20th. Shang lived in the Central Hotel and returned to Ping after attending the First Plenary Session. (20th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen flew to Beijing by Ford plane this morning to attend the First Plenary Session. The secretary Fan Zeshan and Yuan Zhenhuan accompanied him. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the First Plenary Session, told reporters that the First Plenary Session was originally scheduled to open on the 21st. Now, because the Central Committee members scattered in various places have either set off and are still on their way, or have not been able to set off due to official duties, and the Central Committee members in Beijing still want to exchange opinions again before the meeting, it is proposed to wait until all the Central Committee members have arrived before holding the meeting. Now, after consultation with the members, it has been rescheduled to hold the opening ceremony at 9:00 AM on the 22nd, and a preparatory meeting may be held in the afternoon.

<h3 id="e29">The First Plenary Session of the Fourth National Congress <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee of the Kuomintang will officially open tomorrow. After half a year of contention, the leaders of the Ning and Yue factions have finally gathered to discuss and determine the grand plan for the Party and the nation, and the peaceful unification that the people of the whole country have been looking forward to has finally begun to have hope of realization. Therefore, this meeting is actually the key to the survival and continuation of the Kuomintang, and it is also the focus of the calm and patient attention of our entire people. We would like to offer a few points based on what we have seen at the beginning of the conference.</p>
<p>We believe that at the beginning of today's conference, the members of the Kuomintang should first give serious consideration to how the Kuomintang will show that it is different from the Kuomintang of the past, and how the politics of the future will show that it is different from the politics of the past. They should especially give serious consideration to why the government of the past has come to today's change of course, and why the people of the whole country are filled with grief and indignation towards the previous government. If the Party of the future is no different from the Party of the past, and the politics of the future is no different from the politics of the past, and the only differences between the future and the past are the expansion of the number of members and the change of personnel in positions, then what will be the attitude of the people towards the Party and the government in the future? And what will be the fate of the Party and the government? Therefore, we say that this meeting is the focus of the attention of the people of the whole country, and it is also the key to the survival and continuation of the Kuomintang itself.</p>
<p>Regarding the various issues of the Party itself, we certainly do not need to offer unsolicited advice. However, what we must declare is that the years of disputes and disturbances, division and separation, which have led to endless wars, shaken the foundations of the country, and made the people unable to bear their lives, are all due to comrades within the Kuomintang who once shared joys and hardships, and not to enemies outside the Party. Therefore, the people's feelings towards the Kuomintang have gradually changed from support and love to indifference and suspicion. The strong express themselves in words, and the Confucian scholars are severe in their expressions, all because of the Kuomintang's own actions, and not because of the subjective misjudgment of the people. When the Party's army launched the Northern Expedition in 1926, the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country for supporting and loving the Kuomintang was truly like hoping for rain in a great drought. Comparing the present with the past, it is truly unbearable to look back. From this, it can be seen that the people's vision is the clearest and the people's hearing is the sharpest. The people have their own scale in their hearts to weigh the government. A party and a government that are united with the people will surely win the people's support and love, otherwise they will surely be hated and abandoned by the people. There is absolutely no room for compromise or mitigation.</p>
<p>Regarding internal affairs, we have already briefly mentioned several points in the past few days, namely, that we should use a thorough attitude and resolute actions to overturn the foundations of militarist politics and bureaucratic politics, and build a democratic and honest central government that takes the interests of the country and the people as the premise. In terms of administration, the most important thing is that finance must be transparent, transportation must be developed, industry and commerce must be protected and promoted, the constitution must be drafted as soon as possible, and all freedoms of the people must be fully guaranteed. The current disasters must be given full relief. In short, with the changing of the old and the new, all kinds of government affairs should be thoroughly reformed to cleanse the accumulated evils of the past, and the course should be changed. The only key point is whether the government can truly take the interests of the country and the people as the starting point. If it can, then what it shows in politics, even if it is not completely correct, is not far off. If it only shouts slogans and issues announcements, and is hypocritical, then what it shows in politics will inevitably become increasingly estranged from the people. What is even more important is that youth are the backbone of society and the vitality of the country. In recent years, the innocent deaths of young people in the country have been countless. This is truly an irreparable loss to our country. What young people learn in books often differs greatly from the facts they witness with their own eyes. The ideals and reality of young people often contradict each other. Under this kind of stimulation, Confucian scholars drift into passivity, and the strong rise up and make urgent appeals. This is almost unavoidable and is also the most regrettable phenomenon. Therefore, if the government itself truly has undeniable weaknesses, and if the government truly goes against the people, then there is no precedent in the historical records of China and foreign countries that can use power to suppress the "reactionary tide." Lao Tzu said, "The people do not fear death, why frighten them with death?" This is another thing that the members of the Kuomintang should reconsider today.</p>
<p>Regarding diplomacy, the Kuomintang has always declared to the people a revolutionary diplomacy that abolishes unequal treaties, overthrows imperialism, and restores our country's freedom and equality in the international arena. Today, the Northeast has fallen, the hope of assistance from the League of Nations has been cut off, and the smoke of alarm is rising again in the Jinzhou area. According to what the British journalist Lattimore revealed about the Northeast issue, the occurrence of the Northeast disaster was a pre-planned conspiracy among international powers, and it will soon lead to a war among seven countries. According to Stimson's declaration, a major change is about to erupt in Europe. Therefore, the dangers of the international political future can be foreseen. How will our country deal with the imminent foreign troubles? And how will we deal with the ever-changing difficulties in the international arena? This is the most important question and the most urgent question. But no matter what diplomatic policy is determined in the future, we firmly believe that not an inch of our country's territory can be easily given to others, and treaties that humiliate the country and forfeit its sovereignty cannot be signed again. The lost territory in the Northeast must be recovered, and the enemy cavalry within our borders must be expelled. We must not have the mentality that the fall of the Northeast is a fait accompli, and continue to muddle along, allowing half of our country to change color. Today's affairs can only be defended after fighting, and only after defending can we negotiate for peace. Therefore, our country does not want to fight, but in order to defend the country and its territory, and to uphold peace and justice, we cannot but prepare for war. We believe that diplomacy must be self-reliant and self-determined, and we must never rely on or look forward to the assistance of other countries. Our nation should have the determination to rather be a broken jade than a whole tile, and we must never have the luck of surrendering and retreating in order to seek temporary peace.</p>
<p>In short, everything at present is riddled with holes and needs to be repaired. The national pulse and the lives of the people have now reached the final juncture. How to make the greatest determination in this conference where heroes gather, the leaders of the Kuomintang should take good care of it.</p>

<p>Chen Mingshu Replies to Everything</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Representatives of various schools in the capital, including Wang Huishan and others, visited Chen Mingshu on the morning of the 20th, requesting the release of arrested students in various places and requesting the withdrawal of the garrison troops from National Central University. Chen expressed his extreme support for the patriotic movement of the students and adopted a policy of protection. However, after receiving the Beiping demonstration on the 15th, he felt that a large number of students were being used by bad elements. If it was not stopped on the 17th, it seemed that the military and police had lost the ability to maintain order and had fallen into a state of anarchy, which would inevitably cause foreign countries to ridicule us. He then stated that the arrested students in Shanghai had been completely released. If there were any arrested students in Nanjing, as long as someone could prove that they were not reactionary elements, they could be released. Some of the students in Beiping have been handed over to the court for investigation and handling. Regarding the drowned students, he has asked the government to provide compensation. As for the withdrawal of troops from National Central University, it is not a problem. As long as someone is responsible for handling the withdrawal procedures, it can be done. It is heard that the Student Union of National Central University has asked the professors to organize a committee to maintain school affairs.</p>
<p>After the agent is elected, the garrison can be withdrawn after checking whether there are any losses. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Yikuan, a member of the Examination Yuan, was rumored to have been seriously injured by students a few days ago.

The third is proposed by the United States, demanding that those benefiting from foreign debt should provide guarantees together with German bankers, which Germany also opposes, as it would increase the burden on German industrialists.</p>

In order to awaken them from their dreams and respect the spirit of party rule, this association went to the Provincial Party Headquarters at 9:00 AM on December 18th to petition, requesting that they immediately lead the people to organize a provincial anti-Japanese national salvation conference to encourage the government to recover our homeland. However, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee members Han Kewen, Yao Dahai, Liang Xianda, Li Fen, Li Min, Hu Boyue, Qiu Yuantao, etc., initially made excuses and refused to accept the petition, and then promised to send representatives to negotiate. Unexpectedly, after the representatives entered, Han Kewen, Yao Dahai, etc., under the prior instigation of Miao Peicheng, directed their lackeys and the Volunteer Army to open fire and encircle them. The representatives, unarmed, cried out but could not defend themselves and were tragically killed. The villains Han and Yao were still not satisfied and then used machine gunners and hand grenades on the upper floor inside the Provincial Party Headquarters to fire down on our unarmed and isolated masses. People were caught off guard and many were shot down by the roadside. On the spot, five people including Mu Guangzheng were killed, and more than fifty people were seriously injured. The scene of death and injury was horrific and unbearable. The people were filled with indignation but were unable to help because they were unarmed. To this day, the dead and wounded students have repeatedly been lying in pools of blood. Even when the students surrounded and petitioned, the central government did not dare to resort to bloodshed because they respected the people. However, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee members Han Kewen, Yao Dahai, etc., disregarded the great disapproval of the world and opened fire on the people, causing our patriotic and enthusiastic blood to be spilled on the dirty ground, and the dignified seven-foot bodies to die at the hands of villains. They supported the people but harmed the people, led the youth but brutally killed the youth. Their wolfish ambitions are directly aiding the Japanese. If these villains are not eliminated, the country will be destroyed immediately. May our compatriots across the country abandon them together. The Shanxi Provincial Students Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association respectfully bows.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Japanese Army About to Invade Jinzhou <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>▲Recruiting plainclothes teams to disrupt our army's rear</p>
<p>▲Honjo publicly notified consulates in Shenyang</p>
<p>The Dalu News reported from Tianjin on the 20th: Official circles here have received news that the Japanese army commander has decided to attack Jinzhou within 24 hours, hoping to force the Chinese army to within Shanhaiguan. It is heard that the Japanese army has recruited many unscrupulous Chinese near Xinmin, organized them into plainclothes teams, given them cash and ammunition, and sent them east of Jinzhou to disrupt the rear of the Chinese army. This is because the Japanese army anticipates that the Chinese army will resist when they invade westward, and also in view of the lessons of the Nenjiang Bridge, they do not want to lightly engage with the Chinese army and lose soldiers. Therefore, they have decided to use Chinese thugs to disrupt the rear of the Chinese army, hoping that the Chinese army will retreat into the pass without fighting. It is heard that each member of this plainclothes team is issued a new Lee-Enfield rifle, a number of bullets, 10 yen in Japanese currency, and a new set of clothes, all with special markings.</p>
<p>The Dalu News reported from Beiping on the 19th: It is heard that diplomatic circles received news from Shenyang today that the Japanese army commander Honjo notified the consulates in Shenyang yesterday that he will immediately begin attacking Jinzhou to force the Chinese army to retreat within the pass, and explained the reasons for attacking Jinzhou, saying that Zang Shiyi has organized a new provincial government in Shenyang and cannot allow any more Chinese troops to remain within the territory of Liaoning Province, so the Japanese army has decided to attack Jinzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Process of the Ma-Zhang Meeting <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>▲Zhang Jinghui invites Ma Zhanshan to a meeting</p>
<p>▲Zhang receives Ma's understanding and will soon go to Heilongjiang</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Zhang Jinghui, through the good offices of Itagaki, Chief of Staff of Honjo Shigeru, made a long-distance phone call on the evening of the 9th to Ma Zhanshan, inviting him to meet at a suitable location on the Hu-Hai Railway. This is because Zhang is planning to go to Heilongjiang to take charge of the government, but he did not dare to go quietly without Ma Zhanshan's understanding. Ma also believes that many matters in Heilongjiang Province require the maintenance of Harbin, such as the Harbin silver dollars issued by the Heilongjiang Official Bank, which cannot circulate in the Northeast without Zhang Jinghui's seal of the Supervisory Officer. This is also what Zhang can use to trap Ma. Furthermore, before the fall of Heilongjiang Province, the salt tax of 340,000 yuan transferred from Heilongjiang to the central government was intercepted and not issued by Zhang. After Wan Guobin fled with the provincial treasury, Ma sent personnel to Harbin to withdraw the money, but Zhang ordered the bank not to pay, and Zhang still refused after many negotiations. Therefore, Ma did not dare to treat Zhang as an enemy and refuse to meet with him for these two reasons. So after Zhang's phone call, Ma immediately agreed to start from Hailun on the 10th, and the meeting place would be determined later. At 9:00 AM on the 10th, Zhang led many followers across the river to Ma Chuankou, but heard that Ma had not yet departed, so he returned to Harbin. At the same time, Zhang heard a tip-off that Ma was planning to harm Zhang, so Zhang was even more afraid to go. It was not until 4:00 PM that Ma led 300 guards, along with Chief of Staff Xie Ke, Adjutant General Tang Fengjia, Guard Regiment Commander Xu Baozhen, Garrison Commander Pu Datong, and many staff members, on a special train to Suihua, inviting Zhang to come. Zhang said that he could not leave Harbin and asked Ma to advance, either to Songpuzhen (the main station of Hu-Hai, 40 li from Harbin) or to Ma Jiachuankou (the north bank of the Songhua River, opposite Harbin), to meet. Ma then returned to Songpu at 8:00 PM and again called Zhang, asking him to come. Zhang declined due to the late hour and set the meeting for the 11th, urging Ma to wait in Songpu for a day or two, so that if he could not go on the 11th, he would go on the 12th or 13th. Ma, seeing that Zhang was insincere, angrily returned to Hailun early in the morning on the 12th. When he arrived at the Sipingtai station, Zhang had already led Secretary-General Liang Yuxiang, Councilor Wei Jingzhou, Commander of the Special Zone Temporary Garrison Yu Jingtao, Heilongjiang representatives Zhao Zhongren, Li Weizhou, Jixiang, and Liu Dequan, as well as the police team and cavalry team, to Songpu Station. The Hu-Hai Railway Bureau urgently telegraphed the Sipingtai station, asking Ma to turn back and talk. So Ma turned back halfway and arrived at Songpu Station at around 9:00 AM. At 9:40 AM, Ma and Zhang held talks in the office of the Hu-Hai Railway Bureau Director. The inside and outside of the door were heavily guarded by the military and police of both sides. In addition to Zhang and Ma, those who participated in the discussion included Xie Ke, Pu Datong, Xu Baozhen, and Chief of Staff Jin from Ma's side, and Wei Jingzhou, Liang Yuxiang, Zhao Zhongren, Li Weizhou, and Jixiang from Zhang's side. The talks ended at 1:00 PM. The situation is kept extremely secret, and nothing can be found out. When the two sides were talking, Mr. Sugiyama, an official from the Japanese Consulate in Harbin, went to request to participate, but Zhang and Ma told him that the talk did not concern the Japanese side and refused his participation. Many Japanese reporters also requested to enter to listen, but were also refused. At 1:40 PM, a banquet was prepared by the Hu-Hai Railway Bureau. After the banquet, Zhang returned to Harbin, while Ma returned to Hailun at 2:30 PM. A reporter accompanied the car to Hulan, hoping to meet Ma halfway and ask about the contents of the meeting. Ma found it difficult to disclose, but said that he had long wanted to talk to Zhang to resolve many matters, and that he could not change his original intention because of meeting Zhang, so as not to disappoint the people's expectations. No matter what, the interests of the country are the premise, and personal interests have long been put aside. Previously, when meeting with Japanese army representative Itagaki, he also spoke in terms of personal integrity and national sovereignty. If personal integrity is damaged or national sovereignty is hindered, Ma is unwilling to do it. It is heard that when Zhang Jinghui met Ma, he asked Ma to understand, saying that his situation was the same as his, and that the officials in Heilongjiang were in the hands of the Japanese army, and the people would inevitably suffer. Rather than that, it would be better for him to go and maintain it first, and then return the power to him after the overall situation changes. He has no desire for territory. Ma asked Zhang to order the bank not to withhold salt tax deposits and said that if he went to Heilongjiang to take charge of the government, they were both countrymen and he would not oppose it in principle, but he must not be used by the Japanese, and must not use the Japanese, otherwise it would be equivalent to surrendering to the enemy. In addition, he put forward several conditions, and Zhang promised to consider them for a day or two after returning and then reply. Zhang, having obtained Ma's understanding, has decided to go to Heilongjiang to take charge of the government within the next week, or to immediately order Ying Shun to organize the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, while he himself will concurrently serve in Harbin, and Ying Shun will ask for instructions in case of incidents. The north is extremely cold, and the Japanese army stationed in Heilongjiang is not used to the cold. After Zhang goes to Heilongjiang, in addition to being monitored by the gendarmerie and advisors, large numbers of Japanese soldiers must also withdraw. (11th)</p>

<h3 id="e78">Students in Shandong Stranded at Yanzhou Station <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: More than 1,000 students from seven schools including Tai'an No. 3 Middle School, County Normal School, Yanzhou No. 4 Rural Normal School, Three Vocational Schools, Qufu No. 2 Normal School, and Jining No. 7 Middle School, gathered in Yanzhou from the evening of the 16th, waiting for trains to go to Beijing to petition. As of this morning, it has been three days and nights, and the train has not yet departed. They are suffering from exposure and hunger. Many students are sick. Wang Yourong, the Yanzhou Traffic Division Chief of the Jinpu Railway, and the station personnel have been forced to flee. Railway telegrams and telephones are completely cut off. Southbound trains still arrive in Tai'an, and northbound trains still arrive in Tengxian. At 7:00 AM on the 18th, when the special train of Ma Hongkui, the commander-in-chief of the 15th Route Army, and Wang Shuhan, the representative of Zhang Xueliang, arrived in Yanzhou, the students stood on the tracks, not allowing the train to pass, asking Ma to negotiate with Han Fuqu, the chairman of the provincial government, on their behalf, to allocate vehicles and allow them to enter Beijing. Ma spoke with Han by long-distance telephone, and Han replied that he could find a way nearby in Yanzhou. Seeing that there was no solution, Ma ordered the students to board the confiscated No. 201 Pingpu train, and wait until his special train left the station before heading south. The students immediately boarded the train. Because there were few cars and many people, only half of them could fit. The rest planned to wait for the next train to Yanzhou before boarding. After Ma's special train left at 12:05 PM, the students' special train was still not allowed to depart. Four or five hundred northbound passengers in Yanzhou station were blocked at the station and could not go north, and cried out in distress. Gu Liangmin, the commander of the 22nd Division stationed in Yanzhou, telegraphed Han, asking for instructions. Han then ordered the Taishan armored train to go to Yanzhou at 10:30 PM last night to pick up the passengers to Jinan, but there was still no solution for the students' train. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Anhui Province, Wuyuan County, Captured by Bandits <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>▲ Representatives Sent from Shanghai to the Capital to Appeal</p>
<p>The Daily News reports that amidst the pressing foreign aggression and the confusion of national affairs, Zhu's Red Bandit troops from the Jiangxi border suddenly invaded Anhui Province, capturing Wuyuan County on the 17th. The Anhui Provincial Association in Shanghai, in order to rescue all the people of Anhui, yesterday specially sent representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Military Affairs, requesting that troops be dispatched quickly to provide assistance. Their petition is as follows: "We have recently received a telegram from the Wuyuan Association in Shanghai stating that more than a thousand Red Bandits from the Jiangxi border have captured Wuyuan City, looting and killing rampantly, and the county magistrate has fled first. Upon hearing this news, the members of our association are extremely anxious. In addition to having already telegraphed your Ministry, begging you to order the troops stationed in Jiangxi and western Zhejiang to quickly suppress the bandits, we have now heard that Xiuning County in southern Anhui has also been captured. Considering that the Red Bandits are numerous and powerful, the people will have no survivors, and the disaster will inevitably spread throughout Anhui. Fearing that the previous telegram was not sufficient, we are now sending the standing committee members of our association, together with fellow villagers in Beijing, to deliver this letter and the original telegram, prostrating ourselves to plead for rescue on behalf of all the people of Wuyuan. We humbly request that you grant us an audience and promptly devise a plan to suppress the bandits and rescue the people, so as to secure the lives of the people and prevent the disaster from spreading throughout Anhui. This would be a great act of kindness. Respectfully submitted to He, Minister of the Ministry of Military Affairs."</p>
<p>According to the representatives who spoke to the Daily News reporter, Wuyuan County in Anhui Province is adjacent to the Jiangxi border. Several months ago, Zhu's bandits attempted to invade several times, but fortunately, the national army was able to block and suppress them, and the county was spared. Recently, all the troops stationed in the county have been transferred elsewhere, and there are no soldiers stationed in the county seat, which led to its capture by the Red Bandits on the morning of the 17th. After receiving the telegram, we immediately telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting that troops be sent nearby to provide assistance, but three days have passed and no reinforcements have arrived. If this continues day after day, the bandit forces will spread throughout Anhui, and Jiangsu and Zhejiang will also be at risk. The Anhui Provincial Association in Shanghai, in order to save the lives and property of the people of Anhui, has sent personnel to the provincial governments of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi to petition for joint suppression, and has also sent the two of us to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Military Affairs. We also plan to convene fellow villagers in Beijing to discuss rescue measures.</p>

<p>Provincial Committee's Opinion on Party Affairs: Recently, some party members in the county organized a Party Affairs Reform Association, proposing to take over the County Party Headquarters. As a result, there have been conflicting rumors in society. Yang Xingquan and Zhang Gongren, two members of the Provincial Party Committee, came to Wuxi yesterday and convened a meeting at the County Party Headquarters with the local party, government, and police authorities, and also contacted representatives of the stationed troops. They emphasized that joint attention should be paid to local security and that all organizations in the county that lack legal basis should be strictly banned, as they confuse public opinion and affect local security. They also convened representatives from various districts and party headquarters, stating that all contributions that are beneficial to the party affairs of the county can be submitted to the higher-level party headquarters for review through legal procedures. The Party Affairs Reform Committee also held a meeting yesterday, sending a telegram in response to Mr. Wang Jingwei's telegram and issuing a declaration.</p>
<p>Murderer Sentenced to Death: Lu Deguan, a villager from Panshi near Zhangjingqiao in the seventh district of the county, was killed by bandits from the northeast during a bandit riot in the winter of the 16th year of the Republic of China, and his bones were buried to hide the evidence. The case remained unsolved. In March of this year, Zhu Meiji, the head of the security team in the eighth district, arrested three bandit suspects, Wang A'mei, Du Xiao'er, and Pan Fulang, and handed them over to the county, who were then transferred to the county court for trial and detention. Yesterday (the 19th) at around 6 p.m., Judge Huang ordered the police to bring the three criminals, Wang A'mei, and others, to court for trial, sentencing Wang A'mei to death and Du Xiao'er and Pan Fulang to twelve years of imprisonment each. After the sentencing, they were returned to custody.</p>
<p>Completion of Telephone Installation in the Four Townships: The County Construction Bureau, in order to facilitate communication between the city and the townships, previously drafted a plan to install telephones in the city and townships, prepared a budget, and submitted it to the Construction Department for approval. Currently, all eighteen urban and rural telephone stations have been completed on the 9th of this month, and test calls have been made. Director Yao submitted the telephone line map and a list of the remaining materials to the Construction Department yesterday for review and verification and requested that personnel be sent to Wuxi to inspect and accept the project before handing it over to the Wuxi exchange for management, so that calls can be made.</p>

<p>Bandits Rampant Again in the Fourth District: The fourth district of Wujin County has always been a place where bandits roam. Now that it is winter, kidnapping bandits are rampant again. Xia Hanrong's family in Xiajiacun, Yingdong Township, in that district was robbed the night before, and Hanrong's son, Qifeng, was kidnapped. Zhang Hulin, who lives near the village, was also kidnapped on the same day. The Public Security Bureau has ordered that the bandits be arrested and brought to justice.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, Upon reading the special telegram in your newspaper, it stated that Minister Lian of our ministry had requested to resign from the National Government but was not approved, and on the 16th, he requested a ten-day leave from the Executive Yuan and left Beijing for Shanghai immediately, with Chen Yanjiong temporarily acting on his behalf. According to the facts, this is completely untrue.

<h3 id="e87">President of Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Requests Education Director Cheng Tianfang to Take Office <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>▲Visiting Chairman Gu in Zhenjiang Together</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang Correspondence) Cheng Tianfang, the new member of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee and Education Director, has submitted a request to the Central Government to resign from the position in the Education Department. Therefore, he did not accompany Chairman Gu to Zhenjiang to take office, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon around 5 pm, more than 20 presidents from various provincial middle schools visited Chairman Gu. It is reported that the purpose of this unexpected visit was (1) to express welcome to Chairman Gu, (2) to urge Director Cheng to take office in the province as soon as possible, (3) to request the provincial government to order the payment of school expenses for October from the revenue collected during the peak harvest season as soon as possible, and (4) to continue to allocate the 300,000 yuan of education funds from the Shada revenue of the Financial Department and the 300,000 yuan of subsidies from the provincial government.

<h3 id="e88">Chaoyang College Adds Frontier Politics Courses <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education received a report from Chaoyang College, a private institution, stating that the college originally had a Faculty of Law with three departments: Law, Politics, and Economics, which had been reported to the Ministry. However, it has recently observed that China's borders are vast and sparsely populated, and many resources have not been developed. It is a pity to abandon resources on the ground, and the close proximity of strong neighbors creates constant coveting. The lack of effective border management is also a cause for concern. In addition, in recent years, water and drought disasters have spread throughout the inland, and people facing famine have no way to make a living. In order to alleviate the people's livelihood, it is essential to follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan and promote immigration to the Northeast Provinces, Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Tibet. However, managing border affairs requires specialized talents. Otherwise, without proper management, it will not only be a vain attempt to develop the borders but also lead to the contempt of foreign powers. Recognizing this, and in accordance with the National Government's emphasis on practical disciplines, the college has added a Department of Frontier Politics under the Faculty of Commerce this year to cultivate specialized talents to serve the country. Enrollment has begun this year, with eligibility limited to graduates of senior high schools. The study period is four years, and the subjects for the entrance examination are the same as those for other departments in the Faculty of Commerce. Forty students have been admitted and one class has been established, starting classes in September of this year. In addition to submitting a list of students admitted to the Department of Frontier Politics for review and record, all the reasons for the establishment of the Department of Frontier Politics under the Faculty of Commerce are hereby submitted for review. The Ministry of Education instructed that, given that the college originally had departments of Politics and Economics, courses related to frontier politics should be added to the final year of those two departments, and there is no need to establish a separate Department of Frontier Politics. The students admitted to the department this semester can be transferred to the departments of Politics and Economics.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Jing Hengyi Discusses the Foundation of National Education <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai from Guangdong, Jing Hengyi, a member of the Central Committee, returned to his ancestral home in Luyi Township before heading to Beijing by night train last night. When interviewed by a reporter from this newspaper at his friend's residence, Jing Hengyi stated that his joining the Kuomintang was based on the advocacy of National Foundation Education. During the Fifth Plenary Session of the Second National Congress in the 17th year of the Republic, he proposed reforming the salt administration and designating all salt revenue to fund National Foundation Education. The government at that time had no way to implement it, so it was not realized. This time, he entered Beijing with the same intention. If National Foundation Education cannot be implemented after the unified government is established, the Kuomintang will be completely disappointed. When the reporter asked about the content of the National Foundation Education proposal, he said: (1) Designate all salt revenue to fund this education, limited to compulsory education for so-called minors and continuing education and popular education for adults; (2) Establish a National Foundation Education institution directly under the National Government; (3) The salt administration agency is directly under the National Government, called the National Government Salt Tax Institute; (4) Organize a Salt Administration Reform Committee, hiring specialized personnel as members, and education administrators should also participate; (5) Education administration agencies may send personnel to supervise at any time and any place; (6) To adjust the revenue of the Ministry of Finance, a gradual reduction method should be used annually, and after five years, the salt tax will be completely unrelated to the Ministry of Finance; (7) For foreign debt relations, before the unequal treaties are abolished, a certain year can be used as a reference.</p>

<p>Jinan football team, to pass safely through the terrifying waves, and to overcome the Shanghai team in the last three minutes, is it not difficult and gratifying?

<p>▲Jinan Revenge</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Jinan and Shanghai teams played in the Senior Cup preliminary round, and were defeated by one to two and eliminated. Now they defeated them by three to two in the Group A match. It may not be possible to take great revenge in case of emergency. However, the situation was very bad yesterday, and there were many dangers. The new goalkeeper Chen Buzhang saved many goals and is worthy of praise. The other players were just average.</p>
<p>▲Fisherman's Gain</p>
<p>For the first fifteen minutes, neither side won. Although Jinan attacked from time to time, they did not shoot accurately. Then a shocking news came, Jinan suddenly lost a point. The process was like this: Bai Kesi De advanced rapidly from the right side along the edge and intruded, and in a flash he had reached the goal. Feng Yunyou rushed to stop him. Jiang Shan Jing saw that things had gone wrong and also went to rescue him along the same road. Bai Kesi De shot to the left. Jinber rushed up, fiercely and unstoppably. The ball hit someone and can be said that the fisherman reaped the benefits.</p>
<h3 id="e102">▲Black Coal挑門 <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Jinan did not show weakness. Chen Zhenhe shot fiercely in front of the goal, hitting the goal. Carnall was able to save it. The Shanghai team also attacked. Bai Kesi De and Jinber were in danger. Chen Buzhang wanted to save it and fell to the ground. Fortunately, Feng Yunyou headed it out when it was thirty minutes. Chen, Qiu, and Luo went up side by side, about to reach the goal. Fa Ping hooked it out. Mei threw it in. Luo, then Chen, then Qiu. Qiu shot. Ka was not allowed to come out. Long ran in to kick someone, slipped and fell to the ground. Everyone sighed. Chen Zhenhe took advantage of the situation to挑, passing over Ka's head and falling into the goal. Ka turned to the goal, and the ball had crossed the white line.</p>
<p>▲Second Tie</p>
<p>Everyone was delighted. Soon, Jinan scored again. Mei Hongbao advanced from the right and turned to the left. Chen Zhenhe got it. Seeing that it was full of enemies, he quickly passed it to Qiu. Dongyan lightly拨, rolling in. In the first half, Jinan took the lead with two to one. At the beginning of the second half, the Shanghai team pressed the goal. Chen Buzhang rushed out. Whis Lun hit someone with a backhand, but the referee's discerning eyes did not count it. However, the left attack and the right attack continued.

<h3 id="e103">Donghua Defeats Lehua in Senior Cup Replay <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>▲Result: Four to Zero</p>
<p>丨Tense First Half, Bland Second Half丨</p>
<p>Donghua and Lehua, who had previously fought to a draw in the Senior Cup, replayed for ninety minutes at the Zhonghua Baseball Field yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Under the whistle of referee Jiang Xiangqing, Donghua defeated Lehua with four to zero, winning the Senior Cup semi-final qualification.</p>
<p>▲Donghua Team</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan Li Ning Guan Xuanan Chen Pu Tu Kaiyuan Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>Qian Jingyong Li Yichen Dai Linjing Chen Hongguang Chen Yutian</p>
<p>▲Lehua Team</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen Lu Zhiming Zhao Xiasheng Gu Shangdong Wang Shusen Chen Chao</p>
<p>Sun Huipei Wan Xianghua Jiang Chao Zhou Shaowen Li Lin</p>
<p>▲Wonderful Start</p>
<p>The muddy field showed the initial exhibition of war clouds, and the waves were astonishing. The east and west corresponded to each other, which was extremely wonderful and worth seeing. Lehua took the lead and sent the ball over, and the internal defender went forward in five directions to take advantage of the gap. The interior was empty and precarious. A strong wind suddenly came to the rescue, and the ball was blown back in the middle. Zhou Juewen could not stop his foot, and finally relieved the siege with an offside. Donghua took advantage of this to counterattack and went all the way. The goalkeeper Lu personally went outside the pass to resist the various forces and was calculated by others. Lehua's Li Lin挑ed in from the right, and Wan Xianghua headed the ball, but was surrounded and caught. Donghua raised a large army again. Xie Kaiyuan took advantage of the corner kick to shoot with the trend, and Lu Yaoqi caught it. One can be called a quick eye, and the other a quick foot. Lehua's Wan Xianghua performed wonderfully and became an instant hit. In the enemy's formation, he went in and out freely. If he had good assistants, he should be recorded in the book of merit.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Donghua Scores Three Goals in a Row <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>For twenty minutes, no one was in danger of being overthrown in the evil waves. This was because the forward was sharp and the inside was stable and strong. Huadong's Li Yichen opened the record, and the ball shot from the flat ground, as fast as an arrow. Lu could do nothing about it. Fifteen minutes later, the center defender Tu Kaiyuan挑ed in from the right, falling into the upper left corner of the goal. Lu tried to hit it, but the enemy rushed to the ball in the midst of confusion and it bounced into the total nest. Donghua won the second goal. Five minutes later, Chen Hongguang and Dai Linjing kicked twice in succession, both hitting Lu's body. Lehua's Chen Chao came to the rescue, but he made a fool of himself and打入 himself. Lehua lost another goal, losing three goals, which stirred up the morale of the army. The whole army rushed forward, and Zhou Xianyan became the target of the public. At that time, he was lucky to be safe. At the end of the first half, Donghua took the lead with three to zero.</p>
<h3 id="e105">The Situation in the Second Half Was Bland <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, Lehua turned to take the upper hand and should have done something. However, it was unexpectedly lackluster. Perhaps the spirit was lost and the morale of the army was scattered. However, the internal defense was important and worked hard to resist, and the enemy was not easy to underestimate. It was true. The forward's attack on the city was only occasional. At the beginning, he saw Ronghua being invaded, one attack and one defense, for a long time. At thirty minutes, he once sent troops outside the pass. Jiang Chao仰攻 from the right and was rescued by Zhou. From then on, he stayed in the pass to carry out defense work. At thirty-seven minutes, Chen Hongguang was twenty yards in front of the goal. When he was seemingly not advancing, he suddenly raised his foot and swept out. The goalkeeper was startled, and the ball had entered the goal. After Lehua's defeat, he suddenly had the heart to retaliate. The crowd was united and the momentum was strong and difficult to suppress. For a time, the Donghua goal was in a panic again. If it were not for Zhou's composure and Li Guan's courage, it would be difficult to relieve the siege. When the break whistle sounded, Donghua returned in triumph with four to zero.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Central Committee Members Remaining in Shanghai Go to Beijing Together Yesterday <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>▲Eleven People Including Li Liejun in the Morning</p>
<p>▲Five People Including Jing Hengyi in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The Central Committee members remaining in Shanghai, because the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee has been scheduled to hold an opening ceremony today, at 9:30 yesterday morning, they specially prepared a flower car and a first-class car from the Railway Administration, and attached them to the Beijing-Shanghai special express train to Beijing. In addition, Central Committee member Jing Hengyi went to Beijing by night train last night to attend today's session. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Situation of Vigilance at the Station The two Railway Administrations, because they had received prior notice, specially prepared a flower car for the Central Committee members to ride in, and also prepared a first-class car for the use of the attendants. At the same time, they also sent Chen Qubing and Xu Shibin, two staff members, to greet and take care of the members when they arrived at the station. From the entrance gate to the platform boarding place, the tax police regiment and the Railway Administration's road protection police were carefully guarded, and the precautions were very strict.</p>
<p>▲Members Going to Beijing in the Morning Yesterday morning at 9:00, the Central Committee members who borrowed together to go to Beijing included Zhao Pilian, Li Liejun, Cheng Qian, Zhang Zhiben, Qin Zhen, Xue Dubi, Chen Jiayou, Fu Rulin, Fang Shengtao, Shi Ying, and other eleven people. In addition, sixteen important attendants and three servants also went to Beijing by train.</p>
<p>▲Talks by Qin Zhen When the members were boarding the train, a reporter from Xin Sheng She specially visited Mr. Qin Liming on the train. He was given the opportunity to give a speech, saying that in today's situation in our country, internal and external troubles are coming together. In terms of internal affairs, after the flood, how to save the victims and plan the post-disaster construction, and how to realize democratic politics and determine the permanent foundation of the country in politics, are all the most urgent tasks at present. However, due to time constraints, I cannot talk about it in detail. Now I will abandon these two questions and first talk about the most urgent diplomatic problem. In terms of my personal opinions, the attitude and preparation that the people of the country should urgently adopt now, since the Japanese occupied Liaoji, the whole country has been aroused by patriotic enthusiasm and has launched anti-Japanese and national salvation movements, organized volunteer armies, and organized aid-Ma groups, etc. The enthusiastic feelings of striving for survival for the motherland and the nation are indeed worthy of admiration by the world. At the same time, students have risen up to petition the government, demanding a declaration of war against Japan. Their intentions are indeed commendable, but their actions are too superficial. It must be known that today's methods for us to deal with Japan, on the one hand, we should make a painful determination, and on the other hand, we should use a calm spirit to make a vow to fight to the death, so that we can gain more practical benefits in fact, and unnecessary sacrifices can also be reduced. Therefore, my personal opinion is that we should not declare war against Japan now, but should quickly change the declaration of war to the preparation for war. Since we are talking about war, we should first study how we can fight. If we fight with others, how is the training of our army? How is the equipment and food for combat? How is the finance for combat? Even the people of the country should examine their physical fitness and see whether they have the ability to resist the enemy for a long time when they meet in battle. None of these should be carefully analyzed and prepared. Moreover, the timing of the war is not fixed. We must ask ourselves whether we have the preparation for a long-term war before we can talk about war. Let's take another look at Germany during the European War. After years of preparation and planning, the result was that it was food shortages that were the biggest cause of failure. Today, Japan has been planning against us for more than a day. In the past, it has long-term reserves for pre-war preparations, whether it is equipment or food. However, we want to use an unprepared country to deal with a prepared country. The situation is really impossible. Therefore, in the future, our country should adopt proper defense and quickly work hard to prepare itself, so that the methods of war can圖 the survival of the nation and win the final victory.</p>
<p>▲Talks by Jing Hengyi Central Committee member Jing Tingyi, after arriving in Shanghai from his hometown Shangyu yesterday morning, took a train to Beijing that night. A reporter from Xin Sheng She met Mr. Jing yesterday and asked him for his opinions on the political situation. According to Mr. Jing, I joined the Kuomintang specifically to promote national education as my main proposition. At the Fifth Plenary Session of the Second Congress seventeen years ago, I had a proposal to reform the entire salt administration revenue and筹办 national education. The government at the time had no way to implement it, meaning that the people would not be educated, so how could there be a movement. This time I went to Beijing with the same purpose, and said that if national education cannot be办 again after the establishment of the unified government, then the Kuomintang will be completely disappointed.</p>
<p>▲Members Going to Beijing in the Afternoon The Central Committee members who took the Beijing-Shanghai night express train to Beijing last night included Xiong Kewu, Xu Chongzhi, Jing Hengyi, Chen Bijun, and He Yaozu. Five people, including others, all rushed to Beijing this morning to attend the opening ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee. The Railway Administration specially prepared more than a dozen sleeping cars for the Central Committee members and attendants.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Wang Jingwei Temporarily Does Not Go to Beijing Due to Illness <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>▲Doctor Says He Cannot Operate</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei was completely bedridden after entering the German Hospital on December 12. On the 13th, Chen Mingshu came from Nanjing to state Chiang Kai-shek's hope that Wang would go to Beijing with Sun Zhesheng and others after he stepped down. Wang immediately agreed. On the 17th, Wang's illness had not subsided, so he asked Gu Mengyu and other Central Committee comrades who had worked together for several years to go first, and asked his wife Chen Bijun and secretary Zeng Zhongming to go with him to show sincerity in being responsible for cooperation. Wang himself was scheduled to go to Ning by boat on the 20th because his sick body could not sit up. Until yesterday, I learned that it was impossible to go to Ning by boat. The translation of the doctor's statement is now published on the left: "Mr. Wang Jingwei has been completely bedridden in this doctor's private hospital since December 12 for the treatment of diabetes, and a difficult-to-treat disease of the gallbladder has also been found. Mr. Wang is absolutely unable to have any operations at this time. Also, because each injection of medicine will cause fever, if he is forced to travel, it will inevitably cause more dangerous complex diseases and make him never hope to recover his health."</p>

<p>▲Attend the First Plenary Session of the First Central Committee to Solve National Affairs</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin sent a telegram from Hong Kong to Shanghai yesterday, asking to forward a telegram to Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, urging them to go to Beijing to attend the meeting as the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee has been scheduled to officially open on the (21st) today. The original telegram said, (above omitted) Immediately forward to Mr. Feng Huanzhang and Yan Baichuan. Comrade Jieshi resolutely stepped down, and the unification situation will be completed. It is now scheduled to convene the First Plenary Session of the First Central Committee to solve national affairs and seek sincere unity to face the national crisis together. The opportunity is urgent, and nothing is more than this time. It is heard that Brother Jingwei is sick and滞沪, and I am also unable to go to Beijing due to high blood pressure and the need for recuperation. However, this plenary session has the most important and greatest mission, and it depends on the two gentlemen to preside over it. It is also very important. I hope that you will order a trip to Beijing to discuss the major plan together. Although I am sick and搁海隅, I will also offer all that I know at any time. Hanmin叩,巧.</p>

<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen yesterday submitted a document to the National Government, stating that he was requesting to resign from his concurrent positions. Ziwen has been in charge of度支 for four years, and his mind and energy have been exhausted, and he has made no achievements. The President of the Executive Yuan has been approved to resign, and Ziwen should resign from his positions accordingly to clarify his responsibilities. However, because of the importance of finance at the time of the transition between the old and the new, it cannot be suspended for a long time. Moreover, due to the earnest supervision of all parties, he勉力 maintained it and was responsible until the opening of the First Plenary Session of the First Central Committee. Now that the meeting has been scheduled to be held on the 21st of this month, I respectfully request that your office appreciate my humble sincerity and approve my resignation from the concurrent positions of Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, and select personnel to take over to maintain the important government. After this, Ziwen should still fulfill his natural duty as a citizen and the responsibility of a party member, and offer his刍尧 to praise the lofty. I dare to express my sincere feelings, and I beg you to grant my request, and I will wait for your orders.</p>
<h3 id="e111">French Ambassador Writes to Wang Jingwei <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>▲Requesting Explanation of the French Troops' Border Violation</p>
<p>▲Wang has Translated and Telegraphed to Li Zongren</p>
<p>French Ambassador Weil Dun specially wrote to Cantonese representative Wang Jingwei regarding news reports that the Annam government was调动 troops on the border between Yunnan and Guangxi, intending to invade China, formally denying it and asking Wang to explain to the Cantonese side. After receiving the letter, Wang translated the original letter and telegraphed it to Commander-in-Chief Li Delin. The original telegram is recorded below: Commander-in-Chief Li Delin of Guangzhou, I recently received a letter from French Ambassador威尔顿, which is translated as follows: I am writing to you for help. Please forgive me. I have always been treated with favor, and I dare to state it directly. According to a report from the French consul in Guangdong, Guangzhou news reports that the Annam government is调动 troops on the border between Yunnan and Guangxi, intending to invade China. Generals Li and Bai have paid close attention to the propaganda. I should formally declare and correct this unfounded news. However, this kind of propaganda can make ignorant readers deeply believe it and take retaliatory actions. French foreign policy has always advocated peace. The diplomatic relations between France and Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan have always been aimed at harmony. I have long seen it clearly. I still pray that this proposition will be combined to solve the Longzhou pending case that has been delayed for three years as soon as possible. If you approve and explain it to the Guangzhou press, the press will definitely obey. I would like to express my gratitude in advance and hope to receive your guidance as soon as possible. Best regards, 威尔顿, etc. I have heard, Wang Zhaoming铣.</p>

The people are greatly angered. Whether the government will still take a policy of non-resistance, or is determined to fight the enemy with all its strength, should be clearly stated.

<p>Zhejiang people in Shanghai initiated the National Crisis Relief Association of Zhejiang Province. Yesterday, the inaugural meeting was held at the Fu Quanzhe Guild Hall. More than 100 people, including Gao Zibai, Qu Wenliu, and Yuan Qinwen, attended the meeting. Chu Huiseng was elected chairman. The charter was discussed and 35 directors were elected, divided into five groups to handle affairs: foreign affairs, military affairs, economy, finance, and autonomy. There were many speeches at the meeting at that time, all paying attention to facts. The declaration and the list of elected directors are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Published Declaration We Zhejiang people are ancient Yue people. We lie in wait and taste bitterness, and never forget our enemies. Is it not the clear instruction and great oath of my Yue King Goujian, who deeply rooted in the hearts of the people for thousands of years? We, the people, try to rise up and see, what is the situation of foreign aggression today compared with ancient times? Thousands of miles of land have been lost without war. We have been创 for three months, and there has been no decision. We rely on the League of Nations, but the League of Nations does not尽公理 to help us. We hope for the government, but the government still lacks a clear expression. Only we, the people, want to advocate war, but society has no strength to prepare. If we want to talk about diplomacy, we also have no national diplomatic organization that can be used as a foundation. We can only stare with our eyes and sigh while sitting when we see the strong enemy invading. If we continue to do so, and do not quickly rise up to save ourselves together, then we Zhejiang people will treat the national crisis as if the Yue people treat the Qin people's fertility, how can it be? Now the people of Jiangsu Province have initiated this association. We, the people of Zhejiang, are a member of the country. We call and run, why should we accept the later generations? Now, on December 19, the National Crisis Relief Association of Zhejiang Province was established. If we do not defend ourselves, how can we establish a country in the world? If we do not govern ourselves, how can we settle the disputes in the country? To strengthen the power of self-defense, from today onwards, this association誓即will adhere to these two meanings and work together with the people of the whole country to face the national crisis together. The spirit of our ancient King Goujian will really come. This declaration,</p>
<p>▲List of Directors Thirty-five directors, Zhang Taiyan, Chu Huiseng, Shen Hengshan, Zhang Xiaolin, Shen Tianxin, Yin Zhufu, Yuan Wenqin, Zhang Shenzhi, Jin Runxiang, Hu Fengxiang, Gao Zibai, Zhao Chengzhi, Cha Zhongjian, Wang Xiaolai, Qu Wenliu, Dai Lifu, Gao Ziguyu Zhongxian, Zheng Yuzhou, Wei Bozhen, Mao Youfeng, Yu Hualong, Zhu Duomin, Xu Jilu, Qian Xinzhi, Liu Shenfu, Hu Mengjia, Jin Runquan, Wang Zhuzhai, Zhou Gongxian, Lü Daizhi, Wang Fuchuan, Zhu Jieceng, Yao Yongbai, Wang Zhongping, twelve alternate directors, Yuan Ludeng, Tian Duojia, Zhou Shouliang, Shao Daren, Weng Shengshui, Wu Zhihao, Zheng Binggang, Shi Junren, Jiang Zhongquan, Qu Yongzhong, Ji Yangguang, Yu Huan澄,</p>
<h3 id="e114">Important Statement from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>▲Wang Xiaolai Also Gave a Speech</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued an important statement because there were outside parties falsely using the name of the Chamber of Commerce to go to various trade associations to冒盖 seals and convene meetings, etc. The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiaolai, also gave a speech. The following is recorded separately:</p>
<p>▲Important Statement For the statement, since the disturbance of the Chamber of Commerce's affairs occurred, the Chamber of Commerce has issued an announcement expressing its solemn attitude. It is heard that recently, some people have falsely borrowed the name of the Chamber of Commerce and gone to various trade associations to冒盖 seals, and claimed that because the Chamber of Commerce cannot hold meetings, they will convene meetings elsewhere, etc., which is deeply hated. The Chamber of Commerce will convene a general meeting of members in accordance with the provisions of the Chamber of Commerce Law, with its proper procedures and its proper meeting place, and it must also be announced in the newspaper, otherwise it is falsely borrowing the name and using it for other purposes. It is hoped that all members will pay close attention,辨别 the truth before sealing, and examine the right and wrong before attending the meeting, so as not to be taken advantage of by villains and achieve their destructive plans, which is most important.</p>
<p>▲Chairman's Speech Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, gave a speech yesterday, saying that regarding the fact that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce was allegedly led by the so-called Shanghai Special Municipal Merchant Sports Committee to receive it by violence with plainclothes徒众, I have solemnly expressed my attitude. The Chamber of Commerce is a legally produced group. If it is usurped by illegal means, my duty lies in doing my best to maintain it, so as not to be responsible for the entrustment of all members. Yesterday, I saw in the newspaper that the Sports Committee held a meeting in the New World and resolved various cases, which is even more ridiculous. The holding of meetings by various trade associations is regulated in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law. Such illegal actions have no basis, of course. As for restoring the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Zhabei Chamber of Commerce, Nanshi Chamber of Commerce, and the General Federation of Shanghai Business Circles, etc., I do not know that the people who are participating in the Sports Committee today are also the people who destroyed the General Chamber of Commerce and split the General Federation of Business Circles in the past. Anyone who knows a little about the history of Shanghai business operations should understand it clearly. Moreover, I am the chairman of the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce. I feel that after the Central Government reorganized and unified it and reorganized it into the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in accordance with the law, from any aspect, whether in terms of law, theory, or facts, it is absolutely impossible to make the Shanghai merchant groups split into groups again. Leading the business community sports should be for the happiness of the merchants. In this environment and situation, they still want to use the name to快 private interests, and I really don't know what kind of mentality they have. In short, I have always taken abiding by the law and doing my duty as my only purpose. I will never approve of extra-legal actions, and I think the city's merchants also deeply hate and abhor it.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Chairman Feng Shaoshan of the Businessmen's Movement Committee Gave a Responsible Statement Yesterday <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Businessmen's Movement Committee of this city, under the premise that the takeover of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has not yet been realized, began its work in the Industrial Bank building on Jiujiang Road. In recent days, it has convened meetings of representatives from various organizations to discuss the procedures for the takeover, which has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. The news from yesterday is recorded below. After the Businessmen's Movement Committee dispatched Zhao Nangong, Zhang Zilian, Chen Zhiying, Liu Musu, and others to take over the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which resulted in disputes, the actions of Feng Shaoshan, the standing chairman of the committee, have drawn considerable attention from all parties. A reporter from Datong News Agency made a special visit to Mr. Feng at his private residence yesterday, inquiring about the organizational significance of the Businessmen's Movement Committee, its process, and what measures it would take in the future. Shi Zhikun was also present. The two gentlemen jointly issued the following responsible statement. Mr. Feng said, "I appreciate the inquiries from your reporter. The fragmentary records are insufficient to explain the essential principles upheld by our colleagues and cannot dispel the doubts and concerns of the Shanghai business community. Therefore, we have compiled a simple statement for public release, which I believe your reporter will agree with. We firmly believe that China's current situation requires first addressing external threats to secure internal stability. Only through the united efforts of the entire nation to save the country can the Manchurian problem be resolved satisfactorily. Based on this key principle, the Shanghai Businessmen's Movement Committee was organized to promote the Shanghai business movement under the guidance of the leaders of the Nationalist Party and to achieve the following objectives: (1) Return civil rights to the people. In other words, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is an organization of the people, and its rights should be immediately returned to the business community of Shanghai. (2) Abolish all special laws and protect all freedoms of the people. For the past four years, we have suffered immensely from dictatorship and autocracy. The nation is on the verge of collapse, and our people must rise up and seek solutions themselves. We must recognize that without the protection of all freedoms and the ability to exercise all rights, the people will be powerless and defenseless, only fit to be slaves of a conquered nation. They cannot serve as the foundation for building a stable country, nor can they resist the violent invasion of Japan. (3) Punish those responsible for the Liaoning Incident. History shows that there are ministers who lose their country, but never people who lose their country. However, after a country is lost, it is the people who suffer the most. For the sake of restoring discipline and saving the country from danger, how can we not punish the officials who have failed in their duties to demonstrate national credibility and unite the people's will? Only in this way can we deter traitors and rigorously investigate responsibilities to establish a grand plan for a century of stability. Based on these three points, we will never falter. Therefore, there was the previous attempt to take over the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Taking over the Municipal Chamber of Commerce from a group of party traitors and returning the General Chamber of Commerce to the business community of the entire city is the first step in realizing civil rights. No one who willingly serves as a lackey to the party traitors would disagree with this. We are all citizens of the Republic of China, and we should not be so confused as to be willing to be puppets of the party traitors and be manipulated by them. However, at this critical time of national crisis, all our actions must be taken with utmost caution. If there is the slightest resemblance to the actions of the party headquarters on April 18th of the past eighteen years, we must be vigilant. The only thing we hope for at present is that the people can exercise their freedom of will and restore their past power, then our mission will be complete. If, in the meantime, unfortunate events occur in Shanghai, seeking peace but finding danger, seeking benefit but finding harm, it would be detrimental to the merchants. However, if the merchants are willing to be puppets of the party traitors and protect them, then the public anger of the entire city's merchants has been building for a long time, and the will of the people has been violated. A positive conflict may be unavoidable. This is what I am reluctant to say, but it is not the fault of our colleagues, but the evil consequences of the manipulation of the party members and the exposure of the incompetence of the merchants. Using this to confront foreign aggression is not enough to overcome the stubborn invasion of Japan. Using this to confront domestic issues is not enough to establish national peace and stability. At that time, we can only plead guilty to the people of the future and will never shamelessly associate with the party traitors. The Businessmen's Movement Committee has not been public for long, and we fear that outsiders may not be clear about it, so we have summarized its essentials to present to the business community of the entire city. What to do and where to go is their own choice." (Signed by Feng Shaoshan and Shi Zhikun)</p>
<h3 id="e116">Second Declaration of the Businessmen's Movement Committee <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Businessmen's Movement Committee, a joint statement by all executive and supervisory committee members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, hereby issues a second declaration: This committee believes that the current Municipal Chamber of Commerce has long been occupied by party traitors who control the institution, use its name to trample on our merchants, and destroy our shops. The embezzlement and self-enrichment of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, kidnapping and extortion are all obvious facts that cannot be excused by words. The party traitors of the current Municipal Chamber of Commerce have become the target of revolution. The merchants of the entire city have long wanted to get rid of them. Their words have no value for debate. Why? Because their so-called law is a protective talisman for the party traitors, which they use to control the institution and oppress the merchants. Once the people rise up and seek liberation, can this law still bind the entire nation? Their so-called facts should be traced back to the beginning. What laws did the former Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce violate? What disloyal or untrustworthy things did it do to the country and the people? It was forcibly dissolved by the dictator's destruction and the power of the party headquarters, taken from the hands of the people and placed under the government. According to the law, it constitutes the crime of theft, but because it is the government, because it is an organ with power, our merchants have turned a blind eye. Since then, it has been transferred from the hands of the government to the hands of party traitors. This is nothing more than a transfer of stolen goods. What is laughable and pitiful is that the merchants are powerless to correct its right and wrong. Understanding this, the general actions of the current Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, its words, are the barking of a jackal, barking to cover up its crimes, barking to hold on to its territory. Fellow countrymen, I wonder what the true merchants of the city think? Now the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is occupied by party traitors, who does not know it? Because of the persecution of their lives and property, some merchants have followed suit, and some have taken advantage of the fire to loot and help the evildoers. Some follow the east wind when it blows from the east, and the west wind when it blows from the west, and some perfunctorily support the party traitors to maintain their personal business. These people have already become puppets of the party traitors and are being manipulated by them. Can they still seek the slightest benefit for the real merchants of Shanghai? The occupiers of the current Municipal Chamber of Commerce are clearly party traitors, and there are also two or three gentlemen who are willing to be puppets, such as their actions today, which are greatly borrowed by the two or three gentlemen. This committee is ordered by the central government to promote the business movement from secret to public, which is in accordance with the requirements of the situation. The two or three gentlemen may not know it, and now I will reveal the meaning of the medicine to you. This committee vows to use the spirit of repeated stimulation and encouragement to recover the General Chamber of Commerce from the hands of the party traitors, and also vows to return the General Chamber of Commerce to all the merchants of Shanghai with a bright and upright attitude, and to truly realize the principle of returning civil rights to the people. Gentlemen, be careful not to forget your position as the people, and do not maintain the declining trend of a few party traitors, which will be a major obstacle to the civil rights movement.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Wang Hanliang Resigns from the Standing Committee of the Businessmen's Movement Committee <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Wang Hanliang's letter to the Businessmen's Movement Committee states: "To the esteemed Committee: I, Hanliang, am honored to have been recommended as a standing committee member. However, due to my age and limited abilities, I dare not hold a position I am not qualified for. Moreover, I am overwhelmed with other matters and cannot attend to this concurrently. Since the organization of your committee, I have rarely attended meetings and am even more estranged. The resolutions made, as reported in the newspapers recently, include the forcible inclusion of my name, Wang Hanliang, as a standing member in the takeover of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which is even more inconsistent with the facts. At that time, I was on official business at the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and was unexpectedly invited by Mr. Wang Xiaolai for a meeting. As for my explanation, I have always been fair and impartial and was not involved in the takeover. This is a misrepresentation in the report. Furthermore, on the 19th, a meeting of representatives from various industries was convened by the Businessmen's Movement Committee at the New World. Although I attended, it was in the capacity of representing the Antique Dealers Guild. During the meeting, Mr. Zhang Zilian asked me to express my opinion, and I stated when I stood up that I was speaking as a businessman and wanted to report the following points to the representatives: 'With the national crisis imminent, we must unite to save the country and resist foreign aggression. Knowing that the people's movement is a way to save the country, industry, commerce, and academia have united to take the path of movement. On the commercial side, the Shanghai Businessmen's Movement Committee is promoting the awakening of merchants and seeking liberation and a stand from the merchants themselves. Any business organization, for the sake of individual problems, such as those who control the affairs of the association and manipulate rights for personal gain, should be reorganized. For example, the current Municipal Chamber of Commerce, where the fees are heavy and the rights are non-existent. In particular, I have always held a fair and upright attitude, and notices are often not sent to me when the trade associations hold representative meetings to avoid my presence and expression of opinions. Moreover, I am old and of such a nature, and I am often used by others in name only. Today, I am attending based on my conscience and will not favor any side. I only ask for the unity of the business community to overthrow the bad elements, and the people should automatically and consciously rise up to save the country from danger.' After checking the news of your committee's meeting in yesterday's newspaper, it is completely inconsistent. Therefore, I am making a solemn statement that I am overwhelmed with various matters. If your committee holds meetings, I am not notified, and I did not participate in the resolutions. I am afraid of future omissions, so it is better to resign early. I hereby request that your committee approve my resignation from the positions of standing committee member, etc., to make way for the capable, and declare that from today onwards, I am relieved of my responsibilities. Respectfully submitted to the Businessmen's Movement Committee, Wang Hanliang, December 20, 20th year of the Republic."</p>

<p>▲Report on Hu Hanmin's Condition</p>
<p>Lin Huanting, a relative of Mr. Hu Hanmin, received a telegram from Wang Yangchong, Hu's secretary, from Hong Kong yesterday, stating: "To Mr. Lin Huanting: Zhan Gong's blood pressure is still high. We again invited Doctors Du and Huang here yesterday for diagnosis, who said it is still around 178 degrees. Without sincere rest, there is a fear of other complications. They also advised daily chicken soup for recuperation. Therefore, in recent days, apart from briefly reading newspapers, he has spent more time in quiet rest. Various parties are sending telegrams urging him to go to Nanjing. At this time of pressing national crisis and the beginning of a new opportunity, Zhan Gong is the most capable person to promote peace and unity. How could he indulge in leisure? However, his current condition is not suitable for contemplation, and travel is especially prohibited. Previously, traveling south while ill had increased his exhaustion. Therefore, he can only decline. Regarding the future major plans for party and government reform, he has previously telegraphed Mr. Wang and Mr. Sun, briefly contributing his opinions. The talks published in various newspapers have also been seen in general terms. In short, I only hope that those who resign from their posts have sincere intentions and do not harbor any false hopes. The entire council should also base its decisions on the resolutions of the peace conference and the two sides' Fourth Plenary Session to promote the future overall situation. I am fortunate to know this. Respectfully, Wang Yangchong."</p>

<h3 id="e120">Tragedy at the Wing On Textile Factory in Wusong <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>▲Major Clash Between Workers and Police</p>
<p>▲More Than a Hundred Shots Fired</p>
<p>▲Several Workers Wounded</p>
<p>Yesterday, a clash occurred at the Wing On Textile Factory on Yunzao Road in Wusong due to a worker slowdown. It involved the police detachment dispatched by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Over a hundred shots were fired, wounding several workers, and order was disrupted. The authorities declared a special state of martial law. The details are listed as follows:</p>
<p>▲Cause of the Incident According to reports, the old and new Wing On factories employ a total of over six thousand male and female workers. The origin of this disturbance was the workers' demand that the factory pay four months' worth of bonuses. Negotiations with Mr. Guo Shun, the general manager of the factory, failed to reach a satisfactory conclusion. As a result, there was a general slowdown on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. At that time, a small part of the machinery in the new factory was vandalized. Yesterday, the factory, due to unresolved conditions, was deeply concerned that the workers would cause further disturbances. For safety reasons, the factory locked all the machine rooms and announced a shutdown. The Municipal Public Security Bureau police detachment dispatched Squad Leader Gu, leading more than thirty armed police officers, to protect the factory. Yesterday, at about 5:00 PM, male and female workers continued to arrive at the factory to work. Seeing that the gate was tightly closed, they could not enter. They also saw a large number of police officers guarding outside the gate. Before long, a conflict occurred, and the tragedy began.</p>
<p>▲Details of the Conflict When the situation became tense, a reporter rushed to investigate. At that time, the reporter saw that the factory gate was tightly closed, and thousands of male and female workers were gathered outside the factory, standing on the side of the road. Soon, a team of people, holding small red flags, gave speeches to the workers. At about 6:00 PM, the crowd tried to enter the gate, and the police officers guarding the gate fired four or five shots and retreated westward. Seeing this, Zeng, the director of the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau, came out of the factory and reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau by long-distance telephone. The crowd then attacked and opened the gate and poured into the factory. The reporter was also squeezed into the crowd. Soon, the crowd destroyed the office and staff dormitories. At this time, the police officers had sneaked into the interior of the factory from the side door on the west side. They met the crowd, and seeing that the situation was not good, they fired about a hundred shots to demonstrate to the crowd. At this point, the crowd began to retreat outwards. Order was disrupted for a time, and the reporter had retreated from the side door to avoid it temporarily. Wang Yucheng, a standing member of the Eighth District Party Department, also weaved through the crowd to avoid it. Zhao Ze Zhou, the director of the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau, and Zeng Keguang, the director of the office, discussed reporting to the First Regiment of the Seventy-Eighth Division of the garrison and requesting that troops be sent to suppress it.</p>
<p>▲Injury Investigation After the incident, an investigation found that those injured by stray bullets had been sent to Wusong Haibin Public Hospital. They included male worker Li Lunyin, 23 years old, whose neck was pierced by a bullet, bleeding heavily; Gu Jinxiang, 20 years old, a local, who was shot in the left arm; and female worker Jiao Lianying, age unknown, whose skull was fractured. According to Jiang Yisheng, the director of the hospital, Jiao Lianying was beyond rescue, Li Lunyin was also in critical condition, and Gu Jinxiang was not in serious condition. Police officer Wang Heting was injured in the head by a stone. There were several other minor injuries. After the doctors bandaged them, they were discharged from the hospital.</p>
<p>▲Declaration of Martial Law After the incident, the garrison, fearing that rioters would take the opportunity to cause trouble, declared a special state of martial law. All major roads were closed to pedestrians to maintain peace in the city of Wusong. At about 10:00 PM, the reporter accompanied Zhao, the director of the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau, Zeng, the director of the office, Wang Yucheng, a standing member of the Party Department, and Zhao, the deputy officer of the garrison, to inspect the factory. They saw that the room was full of messes, appliances, and objects were destroyed, and the loss was estimated at tens of thousands of dollars or more. Therefore, it was impossible to start work for a while.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Record of the Meeting of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Workers' Union held its city-wide representative assembly yesterday. More than 1,000 people attended. The presidium included Zhao Zhenhui, Fang Qinghe, Chen Hezhi, Xu Zhibao, Zhou Wenhao, and Zhou Dichuchen as the recorder. Lin Meiyan, a city representative, performed the rituals. Chairman Zhao Zhenhui reported on the situation on the 18th when Chen Xuetang and Fang Zheng led unemployed vagrants to break into the office. Fang Qinghe expressed his opinion that he was not aware of the unfortunate incident on the 18th. He received a notice from the association on that day to attend an emergency meeting. The association stated that it should not come to take over without the approval of the general membership meeting. The current directors and supervisors were all produced by the general membership meeting and entrusted by the crowd. How can they transfer without the permission of all members? How can they face the crowd? If approved by the general membership meeting, he will proceed with the transfer procedures. The guidance of the superior representative Lin Meiyan (omitted). The discussion then began: (A) Is the association willing to be reorganized by Fang Zheng, etc.? Please make a public decision. Resolution: (1) Before legal procedures are completed, the association cannot recognize anyone who comes to take over. If it comes to take over after legal procedures, it must also be approved by the general membership meeting before it can be transferred. (2) Fang Zheng, etc., came to take over without legal procedures and instructed unemployed vagrants such as Qi Jinxian, Chen Xuetang, and Li Baokang to destroy the office. An application should be submitted to the higher authorities for arrest. (B) The illegal reorganization committee's publication in Shen Xin's two newspapers said that the association's finances falsely reported accounts and all went into private pockets, which inevitably made members suspicious. Representatives should be elected by the members to review all the accounts of the association to see if there is any case of fraud. It was resolved that representatives should be elected by members of each district to review, starting on the 25th. After the review, they will be responsible for public announcement. (C) What should be done with the 448 copies of blank association certificates that were robbed from the association? Resolution: Members in each industry should pay attention to whether there are any non-members in the shops who have obtained certificates recently. If so, they should report it to the association immediately for investigation. (D) Membership fees and stamps for this month have already been issued. Should they continue to be collected? Resolution: The officers of each district should be responsible for continuing to collect and issue a notice to all members, prohibiting them from delaying payment. If anyone falsely uses other names to collect monthly fees, members should arrest them and hand them over to the local military police organs or the patrol room and report to the association for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Declaration of Various Trade Unions in This City <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>▲Support the Shanghai General Labor Union</p>
<p>Various trade unions in this city jointly issued a declaration to jointly support the Shanghai General Labor Union. This city is the center of the national labor movement, with 100,000 workers. According to the party's doctrine and program, there should be a general organization. However, in recent years, the national situation has been turbulent, and the labor movement has stopped. Hundreds of thousands of workers are wandering on the wrong path and have nowhere to go. Oppression is rampant, and suffering is increasing. Although trade unions have been running around and calling for the establishment of a general labor union in this city to seek the liberation of workers, the authorities have been too prejudiced and suspicious. Shouting and exhausting efforts cannot make up for the difficulties. Now the Shanghai General Labor Union is formally produced under the leadership of the Party Affairs Improvement Committee. The elected officials are all pioneers in the labor community and will surely follow Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and seek the interests of all workers in the city. It will be seen that if they do not chirp, they will chirp to surprise people. If they do not fly, they will fly to the sky. The future of the labor movement is very optimistic. After the joy of the unions, they sincerely lead all the workers to wholeheartedly support it.

<p>▲Transported by Gypsum Ship</p>
<p>The China Press reported that the shipping industry in this port received news from San Francisco on Saturday and Sunday that a specially chartered cargo ship carrying gypsum will soon arrive in Shanghai with 300 Chinese refugees from Mexico. These people were expelled due to the anti-Chinese movement in Mexico and are now scattered in San Francisco and the western coast ports of Mexico. They are all destitute. The expenses will be provided by the Chinese Consul General in San Francisco. It was originally planned to transport them in batches on ships transporting wheat from the United States to China. However, due to the fact that the refugees living in various seaports in Mexico cannot enter the United States to board the ships, it would be too expensive and difficult to send a special wheat transport ship to various seaports in Mexico to transport them. At that time, Mexico had a large amount of gypsum for sale to China. The Chinese Consul General in San Francisco negotiated with Mr. Comeyn, who was responsible for transporting wheat, to rent a ship. In addition to transporting gypsum to Mexico, it also recruited Chinese refugees at various ports in Mexico to board the ship. Finally, it departed from San Francisco and came to Shanghai. These refugees are almost all Cantonese. Therefore, after the ship arrives in Shanghai and unloads the gypsum, it will sail to Guangzhou. The number of people may be more than 300.</p>

<p>Mr. Liu Dajun, Director of the National Government's Bureau of Statistics, has returned home after more than four months of representing our country at international statistical conferences. He arrived at the Gonghexiang Wharf at 9:00 AM on the 19th.

During his trip, Mr. Liu attended the International Statistical Conference, the International Population Conference, and the International Economic Design Conference. He also inspected the statistical systems and economic conditions of various European countries, and he gained a lot of experience.

<h3 id="e127">Opening of the Nan Shi Shelter for the Needy <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>▲ Opens on the 15th of this month</p>
<p>▲ The number of people has reached over a thousand</p>
<p>Every winter, the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Association sets up temporary shelters for the needy in Nanshi and Zhabei to accommodate the poor. Now that it is deep winter, these shelters are being set up again following past practice. The first shelter is located at the Chaozhou Guild Hall on Chezhan Road in Nanshi, and the second is located at the Chao Hui Villa on Longhua Road. If these are not enough, other houses will be found for expansion. In the past, the shelters have only accommodated men, not women. This year, a women's shelter will also be added to avoid disappointment, and a suitable house is currently being sought. In Zhabei, there is already a disaster relief shelter, and it is planned to open a shelter as soon as the disaster relief efforts are completed. The two shelters in Nanshi opened on the 15th of this month, and within a few days, the number of people accommodated has reached over a thousand. This is because there are more poor people this year due to the disaster. However, the shelters have no dedicated funding, relying on subsidies from various charities and temporary fundraising. This year, various charities and local gentry and merchants have repeatedly donated to disaster relief efforts in various provinces, making fundraising for the shelters particularly difficult.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Jiang Shijie and Kang Yongnian, directors of the Shanghai County Public Funds and Public Property Management Office, telegraphed the National Government, the Ministry of Finance, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, and the Shanghai County Government, stating that due to the famine and hardship, it was imperative to exempt farmers from the two-yuan surtax on grain to provide relief. The draft reads: "Concerning the urgent matter of the famine and hardship, we implore you to promptly exempt the two-yuan surtax on grain to uphold the integrity of the government and comfort the people. According to the records, Qin Xitian, the former director of our office, and others submitted a petition in the 19th year of the Republic stating that the two-yuan surtax per shi (unit of dry measure) of grain should not be a permanent practice and requested that your ministry and the Ministry of Finance establish a separate tax law. The Ministry of Finance approved this with document number 11557, stating, 'Upon investigation, this case has been approved to be temporarily limited to the winter grain of the 19th year only and must not be increased again.' The ministry's order is clear and should be eternally followed. However, this year, Jiangsu Province is levying a winter grain tax that still includes a one-yuan surtax per shi, disregarding the people's hardship and failing to consider the political system. After deliberation by the district chiefs and accountants of our county, it was decided that we should urgently request your ministry to order the Ministry of Finance to comply with the approved document, cease the two-yuan surtax, and uphold your ministry's prestige. Furthermore, this year, the excessive rains have caused a disaster, reducing the autumn harvest. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has already verified the disaster and reduced the tax accordingly. We request that you clearly announce whether our county has already reduced or discounted the tax to dispel public doubts. This is our special request for your consideration, as it is a matter of public concern."</p>

<h3 id="e135">Another Proposal to Stop New Year's Greetings <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Lin Youren and others advocated stopping New Year's greetings to commemorate the national crisis, as reported in previous newspapers. Recently, Ma Gongyu and Ma Mengrong of Great China University sent letters to various organizations, suggesting reforming empty formalities, stating: "As the New Year approaches, people from all walks of life will, as usual, exchange greeting cards, 'Wishing a Happy New Year.' Although this is a meaningless formality, it can be tolerated in peaceful times. However, with the Northeast fallen, the Southwest in alarm, the nation in imminent danger, and the people struggling to survive, there is no time for condolences, let alone celebrations. Empty formalities should be abolished with determination, and patriotism should be more than just empty talk. Sending New Year's cards seems like a minor matter, but when considered on a national scale, it has significant implications. Assuming that each person spends two yuan on purchasing cards and postage, and if this activity is engaged in by just one percent of the national population, the total cost would be eight million yuan. Over ten years, this amounts to eighty million yuan. Such a huge sum, if used for any beneficial cause for the country, would be far better than the meaningless formality of 'wishing a happy New Year.' Moreover, the fashionable greeting cards sold in the market are either directly imported from foreign countries or printed with foreign paper materials, with none entirely made of domestic materials. Young men and women, in addition to wearing foreign clothes, watching foreign movies, and using foreign fountain pens, still feel they have not fully realized their ability to Europeanize. Therefore, they must compete and vie with each other in greeting cards, imitating Westerners. The poverty of the country and the hardship of the people are not their concern. Patriotic compatriots, who usually shout slogans to 'Overthrow Imperialism,' will donate millions of yuan every New Year for this meaningless formality, to pay homage to the imperialists, helping their strength to invade us. Is this not regrettable? Therefore, this kind of 'Wishing a Happy New Year' can be rightly called 'Wishing the Imperialists a Happy New Year,' which is not an exaggeration." It can be seen that "stopping New Year's greetings" has become the consensus of the people.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Thug Attempts to Evade Responsibility for Extortion <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>▲ Claims he was only following to observe the situation</p>
<p>▲ Detective Tang recounts the capture</p>
<p>Li Jinzhi from Tongzhou wrote threatening letters between the 12th of last month and the 7th of this month, extorting 1,000 yuan and 500 taels of silver from Wang Long, a Ningbo native and owner of the Wang Longji Laundry Company at No. 2534 Zhoujiashui Road. After the case was uncovered, Tang Jian, a Chinese detective from the General Inspectorate, and Wu Changkai, a detective, arrested him and brought him to the First Special District Court for questioning. He denied the charges and was detained for investigation. Yesterday, Judge Shen Bingrong continued the hearing in a higher court. Zhang Tianyin, the detective's lawyer, stated that his accomplices could not be arrested during the period of rescheduling. The victim, Wang Long, testified that he saw the defendant and two others in front of the Dasheng Temple in Hongzhen, Zhabei. The defendant lingered on the road three or four times, then stepped forward and asked him if he was the Wang from Zhoujiashui Road. Wang replied in the affirmative. Just as they were about to continue talking, the detectives arrived and arrested the defendant. The other two thugs were standing far away, one tall and one short. When questioned, the defendant firmly denied any involvement, claiming that the plaintiff's statements were entirely fabricated and that the incident was committed by his friend, Ji Shan, who was at large. He claimed that he saw their suspicious behavior, so he followed them to observe the situation and intended to report any minor matters to the detective. The court ordered him to write the key phrases and numbers from the threatening letter on the spot for handwriting comparison. After examining the handwriting, the court declared to him, "You are a worker at the Meifu Electric Light Factory, not a detective's partner, and it is absurd for you to make such a claim of tailing someone to gain merit." The defendant also stated that if he had spoken to the plaintiff, he would be willing to accept severe punishment. Zhang, the detective's lawyer, stated that Detective Tang witnessed the incident and requested his testimony. According to Tang Jian's testimony, he saw the defendant and the two others walking out of the Dasheng Temple and lingering. As soon as they saw the plaintiff's sign of a Pu Bao towel, they approached him. Seeing that the area was remote, he feared that the plaintiff would be harmed, so he went forward. The defendant then fled, but was eventually captured. Judge Shen then ordered Li Jinzhi to be remanded in custody pending a scheduled sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Factory Workers Brawl, One Dies Tragically <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Wang A'ren, a carpenter from Ningbo, was a worker at the Anji Construction Factory on Julai Road (Route Paul Beau) in the French Concession. Yesterday morning, Wang delivered meals to the factory and ate with the other workers. Lu Youming, a local worker, said that Wang was late in delivering the meal. The two started arguing and then fought. They were eventually separated. Unexpectedly, at around 11:00 AM, Wang suddenly vomited non-stop and was unable to support himself. Seeing the situation was bad, the other workers rushed him to the Shuimu Hospital. Unfortunately, he died at the hospital at around 1:00 PM due to injuries to vital organs. Lu Youming was arrested on the spot. The factory owner filed a report with the detective, and the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Morgue for autopsy.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Sichuan Woman Sues for Fraudulent Marriage <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>▲ Dismissed by the court</p>
<p>Zhang Yang Xianfen, a woman from Baxian County, Sichuan Province, is seventeen years old. Since she has not reached adulthood, her mother, Yang Xia (age fifty), acted as her legal representative. She hired attorney Zhang Ding to file a lawsuit in the criminal division of the Second Special District Court, accusing Zhang Dayuan from Wuxi and his elder brother Zhang Zhirui, Zhang Boliang, and others of abandonment. The complaint reads: "Fraudulent marriage, disruption of family, request for arrest and prosecution, and request for incidental civil lawsuit to recover support and consolation money. The plaintiff, Xia, gave birth to a daughter, Xianfen. In the winter of last year, Zhang Dayuan, a wealthy merchant from Wuxi residing in Sichuan, proposed marriage through a matchmaker, intending to marry Xianfen as his wife. In March of this year, Xia personally went to Shanghai and met with Dayuan's elder brother Zhang Zhirui and Zhang Boliang. She inquired about Dayuan's character, family background, and financial situation. Zhirui and Boliang acknowledged that Dayuan was their younger brother and that he had shares in the father's Shenxin Textile Factory, as well as real estate and cash in Shanghai worth approximately 200,000 taels, which had not yet been divided. They assured her that after Dayuan married, he would be able to afford family expenses by drawing five to six hundred yuan per month from his share of the inheritance. Xia believed this to be true and returned to Sichuan. In June of the same year, Xianfen and Dayuan formally married in their hometown. Several months later, Dayuan returned to Shanghai first, promising to live with his elder brother in Shanghai for care. In September, the plaintiff, mother and daughter, along with two servants, brought their belongings to Shanghai and temporarily stayed at the Ping'an Hotel. They sought Zhang Dayuan without success. They contacted his elder brother Zhirui and Boliang, informing them of the reason for bringing the family to Shanghai. Zhirui rented a house for them at No. 8 Shengmuyuan Road and promised to inform Dayuan to come forward and arrange matters. If expenses were needed, they could be sent or drawn from Dayuan's inheritance. Unexpectedly, for two months, nothing was done, and Dayuan's whereabouts remained unknown, leaving the plaintiff stranded in Shanghai. Due to lack of funds, they could not move into the rented house. The defendant Dayuan should be held criminally liable for abandonment, which goes without saying. Tracing back to the origin, Xianfen and Dayuan's marriage was based on consultations with his brothers Zhirui and Boliang, who all claimed that Dayuan was their younger brother, how wealthy he was, and how he would have no worries about his livelihood before they agreed to the marriage. If the defendants had informed the plaintiffs of Dayuan's character earlier, they would not have wrongly married their young daughter to Dayuan. In their actions, the three brothers conspired to bring about the marriage through deception, which is clearly a violation of Article 310 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, the plaintiff requests the court to summon the defendants to court, pronounce them guilty, and punish them according to the law. Furthermore, Xianfen and Dayuan are legally married, making them members of the Zhang family. Therefore, they request an incidental civil lawsuit, and the defendants should be held liable for support obligations under Article 1114 of the Family Code, and order the defendants to pay a one-time support and consolation fee of 40,000 taels, to be received by the plaintiff Xianfen." The court, upon receiving the complaint, held a hearing on the previous day. First, the plaintiff's attorney presented the case, stating that Xianfen was three months pregnant. Zhang Dayuan testified that after the plaintiff and his mother came to Shanghai, a merchant rented a house for them and instructed the plaintiff to move in and live together, but the plaintiff and his mother ignored it and abandoned the opportunity themselves, and that it was not abandoned by the merchant. The merchant strongly objected to the plaintiff's request for consolation money. His lawyer argued on behalf of Zhang Zhirui that the merchant had been adopted out at a young age and had already severed his relationship with the Zhang family. Zhang Boliang stated that the merchant's family property had already been divided before his younger brother married the plaintiff and that there was evidence of this division. The merchant's marriage with the plaintiff had nothing to do with the merchant. After debate by the lawyers of both parties, Judge Luo Renji declared the end of the debate and sentenced the plaintiff's accusation of abandonment and incidental civil lawsuit to be dismissed together, and declared the defendants not guilty.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Zhuang Jihuai Favors Concubine, Suppresses Wife <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>▲ Accused of Neglecting Support</p>
<p>▲ Court Orders Mediation</p>
<p>Zhuang Jihuai of Ningbo married Zheng Liqing and lived in their hometown for eighteen years. Zhuang came to Shanghai to manage real estate and made considerable profits. However, feeling lonely as a sojourner, he took a young woman as a concubine, keeping her in a luxurious home and enjoying tender pleasures, neglecting his legal wife. Later, Mrs. Zheng learned of this in their hometown and came to Shanghai as well. At first, the legal wife and the concubine lived together, but as time went on, their disagreements deepened, and arguments arose frequently. Whenever the two women argued, Zhuang failed to mediate fairly, siding with the concubine and suppressing his wife. Increasingly angered, Mrs. Zheng rented a separate house. Unexpectedly, Zhuang soon cut off her living expenses, leaving her in dire straits. She was forced to file a petition with the First Special District Local Court, requesting that Zhuang Jihuai be summoned to court for mediation to continue providing monthly support to maintain her livelihood. However, despite repeated summons issued by the court, Zhuang persistently evaded them, making mediation impossible. Consequently, Mrs. Zheng formally filed a lawsuit against Zhuang for alimony and requested the pre-trial seizure of the defendant's assets, which was approved. Zhuang then urgently hired a lawyer to file a formal defense. Yesterday, Judge Yang presided over the court hearing. Both parties, accompanied by their lawyers, were present. Zhuang, with his eloquent tongue and skillful rhetoric, preempted the plaintiff's lawyer and the plaintiff herself, launching into a detailed account of his relationship with Zheng, from their marriage to the present situation, resembling a lecture. The judge, finding that much of his statement was irrelevant to the case, repeatedly stopped him, but he continued to speak volubly and somewhat plausibly. Judge Yang, noting that he had no intention of abandoning his wife, inquired whether he could provide the plaintiff with forty gold coins per month for living expenses. Although he did not deny it, he insisted on his poverty. However, according to the plaintiff's testimony, if the defendant were not wealthy, why would his concubine's residence be furnished entirely with rosewood furniture? Furthermore, the real estate company he managed was not closed down; it was only after the lawsuit was filed that he removed the signboard. She requested that the court not be misled by his false claims. Zhuang then continued, "I really have no funds to pay the plaintiff, but my elder brother can provide her with forty silver dollars per month." Zheng immediately countered, "Her brother is now in Ningbo; how can he give me the money?" Zhuang then retorted, "If the plaintiff does not want to go to Ningbo to receive the money, my younger brother can pay her." Hearing this, Zheng continued, "Although her younger brother used to run a silk shop in Shanghai, he is now unemployed and has no extra money to give me." The judge then ordered an adjournment, instructing both parties to discuss a settlement out of court and await further consideration.</p>

<p>▲ Sent to Court for Trial</p>
<p>Gong Xia, an old woman from Nanxiang, is fifty-one years old. She has one son and one daughter. Her son, A Da, is twenty-six years old and currently works as a senior steward for a foreigner. In the winter of the fifteenth year of the Republic, she arranged for her son to marry a village girl named Wu through a matchmaker. After their marriage, the couple's relationship was relatively harmonious. However, after only a year, Wu suddenly had a change of heart, falsely accusing her husband of neglecting her support. Subsequently, she packed up her clothes and disappeared without a trace. Although her mother-in-law and husband immediately launched a thorough search, her whereabouts remained unknown. Time flew by, and three years have now passed. Gong Xia, whose son now works in Shanghai, came to Shanghai in August this year and rented a room in a bungalow in Xiaoshadu, west of Shanghai, to search for her runaway daughter-in-law. It was not until the other day that she learned that Wu was hiding in No. 31, North Caojiazhai, Caojiadu, west of Shanghai. Ostensibly, she was working in a yarn factory to make a living, but in reality, she had become intimate with someone. Yesterday morning, Xia, accompanied by her younger daughter, went to the address and seized Wu, urging her to return home. Wu adamantly refused. They immediately called the police, who took her back to the Sixth District Police Station. According to Gong Xia's statement to the district chief, as mentioned above, Wu, who is twenty-five years old and from Nanxiang, stated that she was forced to flee to Shanghai to work and make a living because her husband neglected her support and subjected her to all kinds of abuse. It has been three years now. She heard that her husband has remarried. If she returns home, she will inevitably be abused even more. She really cannot bear the suffering and is therefore unwilling to return home with her mother-in-law. After hearing the statements, the district chief, considering the case of the runaway daughter-in-law unwilling to return, ordered that a written report be prepared and sent to the court for trial.</p>

<p>▲ Jiang Chunrong Already Cohabiting with the Woman</p>
<p>Hou Wenjin of Taizhou, twenty-one years old, resides at No. 4, Xingye Lane, Caojiadu. He works as a laborer in a yarn factory. He has an elder sister named Xiuying, who is twenty-four years old. She came to Shanghai from her hometown to visit her younger brother. Unexpectedly, last month, Xiuying suddenly disappeared. Hou searched everywhere but could not find her. Recently, he learned that Xiuying was having an affair with Jiang Chunrong from Yangzhou and living together at No. 3, Wangjiazhai, Nanshi. Last night around nine o'clock, he rushed to the address and found his elder sister Xiuying, along with Jiang Chunrong. He took them both to the First Precinct, First Station, under whose jurisdiction the address falls. When the station chief preliminarily interrogated them, Hou Wenjin testified about the previous situation and requested punishment. When questioned, Hou Xiuying stated that she had been promised to a man from her hometown by her parents. However, she recently heard that her fiancé's family was poor and unable to marry her. She feared being delayed for life in his family, so she cohabited with Jiang Chunrong. When questioned, Jiang Chunrong, thirty-two years old, stated that he was a laborer and had been having an affair with Xiuying for a long time. The other day, she came to his house and asked to live with him. Because he could not refuse, he agreed to take her in. The defendants were deemed extremely shameless, and an order was issued to prepare a written report and send them to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

Furthermore, they investigated the raw material warehouses and confirmed that no Japanese goods were present. This is the factual report. Accordingly, this letter serves as verification. Please take note."</p>

<p>Yuqingfeng Tobacco Shop in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, had seventy-six packages of American kerosene confiscated by the Nanshi Japanese Goods Inspection Office due to mistaken identification as Japanese goods. They have repeatedly requested verification from the Tobacco Exchange Association and requested its return, but have not been approved. The shop prepared a written statement yesterday and sent it to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in Shanghai, stating, "Concerning the matter of requesting, we are merchants operating Yuqingfeng Tobacco Shop in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, also dealing in soap and candles. On the 29th of last month, your association's Nanshi Inspection Office sent personnel to the shop and confiscated seventy-six packages of American kerosene, which were raw materials for manufacturing candles for customers, due to misunderstanding, along with three volumes of the source of goods register. The goods were transported to the office and sealed. Our shop reported this to our trade association, which issued a verification letter on December 17th. The source of goods register has been returned by your association, but the kerosene has not been returned for almost two weeks. We imported these raw materials to manufacture candles for customers. The delivery date promised to the customers has passed by many days. The customers urgently need the goods and have repeatedly sent letters urging delivery. We have repeatedly requested extensions, but without success. We fear that this will cause disputes and claims for damages. We are forced to submit this written request, hoping that your association will understand our sincerity, quickly verify and return the goods to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and avoid compensation. We will be eternally grateful."</p>

<h3 id="e159">Opposing the Scattered Sale of Confiscated Japanese Goods and Questioning Mr. Xue Guangqian (High School Leisure) <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>In the 51st issue of Life Weekly, Volume 6, Mr. Xue Guangqian had an article expressing his views on the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association Design Committee's draft on how to dispose of confiscated Japanese goods. The draft has never been made public. Outsiders only heard that its content was roughly the same as that proposed by the business community's Economic Severance Association. Seeing Mr. Xue's letter now, it can further confirm that the Anti-Japanese Association Design Committee's draft is indeed a scattered sale plan, not a centralized public sale. "Unconditional scattered sale is certainly a malicious accusation," but scattered sale is still scattered sale, only a conditional one. I believe that the current point of contention is the two paths of scattered sale and centralized public sale. The right and wrong are clear, and there is no need to hesitate or waver. There is absolutely no room for compromise.</p>
<p>What kind of conditions are involved in the so-called conditional scattered sale? When implementing scattered sales, how will you prevent the many unregistered Japanese goods and future smuggled goods from taking the opportunity to be sold? The Anti-Japanese Association Design Committee has proposed no more than three preventive measures: (1) issuing sales licenses, (2) stamping each item, and (3) establishing separate account books when selling. Mr. Xue said, "Its preventive and sales methods are extremely cautious." In my opinion, these methods can be said to be a kind of deception that can only fool children. Suppose you have a bolt of confiscated Japanese cloth. As long as you register with the Anti-Japanese Association and get a sales license, you can openly sell it. Who has the time to ask you if you have a sales license and to distinguish whether your sales license is genuine? Moreover, the sales license and the goods being sold are not inseparable. One sales license can be used repeatedly many times. With a bolt of registered Japanese cloth, you can sell dozens or hundreds of bolts of Japanese cloth. Hidden smuggled goods can certainly be gradually sold off. On the one hand, you can still import goods from the Japanese. The so-called "inventory" will come from a source and will never be sold out. "Stamping each item" is even more ridiculous. May I ask how you stamp Japanese sugar, Japanese coal, and Japanese seafood? How do you stamp it on the outside of the package? What happens after the package is removed? How do you use one package dozens of times? The value of the Japanese goods confiscated in Shanghai is as high as tens of millions, and the number of items is over one hundred million. Suppose the Anti-Japanese Association sends dozens of trustworthy staff to stamp each piece of cloth, each fish, and each piece of coal (not to mention each grain of sugar), and gives it a stamp. Even if dozens of people work at the same time, it will probably take more than half a year. Anyone can forge these dozens of wooden stamps. Within a few days, they can be transformed into thousands. The general public, seeing a few blurred words, will think it is an Anti-Japanese Association stamp. As for whether the stamp is genuine or fake, we are not seal experts. How can we distinguish it? The method of establishing separate account books is even more inexplicable. If a merchant prepares an account book but does not use it, what can you do? You can't possibly send someone to supervise him in every store. What cunning merchant who sells smuggled goods would honestly record it in the account book and wait for you to report him? There is absolutely no such fool in the world.</p>
<p>Scattered sales have not yet been implemented, and it is already impossible to prevent the leakage of Japanese goods. Everyone, try to imagine what the anti-Japanese movement will look like if scattered sales are actually implemented. The so-called sales license and stamping of each item will become a kind of talisman for unscrupulous merchants. Before, it was done stealthily. Now, they can sell openly and brazenly. Registered goods and unregistered goods, old stock and newly imported goods, will inevitably become indistinguishable. The work of inspection will also be impossible. Once this dam is broken, Japanese goods will definitely flood in like a tide, inundating all of China. Months of effort and sacrifice will only create an opportunity for unscrupulous merchants to make a fortune. If you must put the confiscated Japanese goods up for sale, there is no second way to go besides centralized public sale. Merchants who want to recover their costs can find ways within the scope of centralized public sale. Why do some people insist on adopting that scattered sale system that is impossible to prevent? People who do not want to steal will never object to others closing the door and locking the box. Boycotting Japanese goods is our nation's only remaining weapon. We cannot listen to a small number of people and easily lose it. Before the Anti-Japanese Association's final plan is decided (the draft mentioned above has been temporarily put aside), we should all stand up and closely supervise them. All groups should have a serious expression.</p>
<p>▲ Postscript: Everyone knows the evils of the scattered sale system. Those who cannot profit will not advocate scattered sales. Even with centralized public sale, there must be a proper method. You must not sell all the inventory as much as possible. I advocate a phased sale solution. Now, I will excerpt a section from the letter I wrote to the Anti-Japanese Association below.</p>
<p>"... The reason why previous boycotts of Japanese goods failed was due to the unrestricted sale of Japanese goods that had already entered the country. During the boycott period, it was carried out with great fanfare. The source of Japanese goods was temporarily cut off, but there were still many inventories on the market that could meet the temporary needs (before each boycott, merchants would rush to import large quantities of Japanese goods, and there would be no worry about not having goods to sell for several months). When the inventory was about to be cleared, the boycott was canceled invisibly, and large quantities of Japanese goods could be imported again to make up for the shortage of Japanese goods on the market. This is why Japanese goods imports must increase greatly before the boycott, and Japanese goods imports must increase greatly after the boycott. In the long run, Japanese goods imports have not decreased compared to normal times... If the goods confiscated this time can be preserved until the boycott is over, and then put up for sale again, then there will be a sudden increase in Japanese goods on the market at that time, and there will be no need to import large quantities from Japan. During the boycott period, Japanese goods will disappear from the market, and their sales will be taken away by Western goods or domestic goods. The Japanese will have no way to compensate for this kind of loss. If you boycott for one year, there will be the effect of one year. If you boycott for two years, there will be the effect of two years. It will not be like the complete failure of the past. Even for the sake of the merchants' costs, the goods imported before the boycott cannot be sealed forever. As a last resort, there is also a compromise solution. How can you rashly unload the confiscated goods on the market and ruin the future of the boycott movement? I have proposed two strategies for the disposal of confiscated goods: (1) after six months, conduct a centralized public sale and allow merchants to use this inventory as collateral; (2) conduct a limited sale, for example, goods that can be sold in one month during normal times should be sold in four months, selling one-quarter each month. In this way, three-quarters of the Japanese goods market will be taken away by goods from other countries. The second method seems easier to implement..."</p>

<p>To the Editor, Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Business Transportation Committee's merchants association representative meeting reported in your newspaper's local news on the 20th of this month, there was mention of the iron industry and the third temporary motion included the proposal from the iron industry and other industries. Our industry was unaware of the Business Transportation Committee meeting and did not send a representative to attend. However, we heard that Mr. Lu Peizhi went to the meeting upon receiving a letter, but left shortly after sitting down. He did not propose any matters, and it was Mr. Lu's individual action, not representing our entire industry. We fear that the rumors are inaccurate and request a correction to ensure accuracy. Sincerely, Shanghai Iron Industry Association, December 20, 1931. To the Editor, Today I saw an article in your newspaper (Business Transportation Committee news) with the phrase "Qiu Liangyu of the Second District City Federation and others attended." I went yesterday as an individual to listen in. I had just signed in and was about to enter when a friend came out and said that the meeting was about to end, so there was no need to go in. Therefore, I left with him and did not attend, nor did I represent the Second District City Federation. Please investigate and correct this matter. Sincerely, Qiu Liangyu, December 20.</p>
<p>To the Editor, Upon reviewing your newspaper's local news section on the 20th of this month, there was a report on the meeting of the First District Electrical Workers' Union, which stated that the Municipal Ink Industry Union participated. Our union did not send any representatives to participate, which is inconsistent with the facts. We hereby issue a statement and request a prompt correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Ink Industry Workers' Union. To the Editor, Yesterday I read in your newspaper's local news section about the declaration of various labor unions supporting the Party Affairs Improvement Association. The Sixth District Qin Industry Union was listed, which caused great consternation. There is only one legitimate organization of Qin industry workers in this city, and there are no other organizations. Our association was not consulted about supporting the Party Affairs Improvement Association beforehand, and it is obvious that someone is impersonating us in an attempt to confuse the public. We hereby request that your newspaper grant a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Qin Industry Labor Union.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Finance Strong Fluctuations in Last Week's Bid Gold <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>▲ Sharp ups and downs with fluctuations exceeding forty taels. Last week's bid gold was exceptionally volatile and extremely chaotic, fluctuating wildly and difficult to predict. Daily differences ranged from ten to twenty or thirty taels. It coincided with the swap day, and the price of the February session was lower than that of January. Therefore, short sellers posted ten taels, with the maximum reaching seventeen taels, due to pressure from large bullish accounts. It is said that Yu Fengyong's bullish position amounted to over eight thousand contracts, and Guangbang Hengxing also held a considerable number. The Dalian gang still held a slightly short position. Since the market weakened at the beginning of the week, the minimum price for January was 639.5 taels. Subsequently, the trend became strong, albeit with many complexities, largely due to conflicting domestic and international news. Until Friday, the maximum price for February reached 674.5 taels, as the Central Bank consistently bought in, subsequently selling US dollars. As a result, the price retreated to the sixty tael mark. The total weekly fluctuation exceeded forty taels, and after review (plus a ten tael swap), it still rebounded by two taels and a fraction. As for overseas silver markets, the trends diverged, with British silver slightly declining and American silver rising. In the Shanghai market, both British and American exchange rates were loosely traded, both overtly and covertly. It is estimated that British gold increased by one tier, and American gold by 0.625. Actual bank transactions showed that British gold exceeded two shillings, while American gold was above thirty-four yuan, indicating tightness in the long term and looseness in the near term. Chinese merchants engaged in both hedging and arbitrage, gradually narrowing the spread from over fifty taels to around thirty taels. However, the gold gang's short positions were substantial, likely due to the initial rise and subsequent fall of British and American exchange rates. All settlement prices were calculated in US dollars at a reduced rate, initially sixty to seventy taels, with a maximum of over eighty taels, a minimum of forty to fifty taels, and finally over sixty taels. Spot gold initially added about six taels, but later, due to the swap, it added fifteen taels. However, with the arrival of goods from Tianjin, it only added twelve taels. Given the complex domestic and international situation, the future of the gold market is feared to be turbulent. The following is a summary of the week's events:</p>
<p>▲ A week of market turbulence. From Monday (December 14th), the large silver bar retracted 0.375, American silver retracted 0.375, and shillings were listed one tier long, due to exchange rate arbitrage. The internal market was also loose. The initial bid gold for January opened sharply lower by 27.5 taels, at 642 taels, mainly due to the establishment of the Seiyukai cabinet in Japan, which immediately ordered a ban on gold exports, coupled with President Hoover's proposal to defer war debt payments, which were unfavorable to the gold market, causing widespread anxiety. Next was 39.5 taels. Soon after, major accounts took the opportunity to purchase, and with the strengthening of the US dollar, it was rumored that the United States was responsible for mediating between China and Japan, causing the gold price to suddenly rise by 22 taels, to 61.5 taels. By noon, it had retreated to 50 taels, as sellers became bold, closing at 49.5 taels. The afternoon opened at 50.5 taels, and subsequently fluctuated, ranging from 46.5 to 59 taels, closing at 54 taels, a decrease of 15.5 qian from the previous Saturday, with a daily fluctuation of 22 taels. Speculator Mr. Wu and foreign merchant George Joseph both exited the market. The Dalian gang also liquidated over 2,000 contracts, while the Guangbang made only a few purchases. On Tuesday, the large silver bar continued to decline by 0.25, while the US dollar rebounded by 0.875, and shillings retracted by three tiers, while the US dollar only retracted by 0.375, due to the large exchange rate spread. The domestic market was strong in British currency and loose in American currency, with the gold gang buying British and selling American. The gold market initially opened at 652 taels, a slight decrease of 2 taels. Subsequently, due to the impending swap, bullish investors raised the price, and it rose to 663.5 taels, prompting short sellers to quickly cover their positions. The noon close was slightly lower, at 57.8 qian. The afternoon opened at 54.5 taels, followed by 3 taels, and then various firms privately opened swaps one day early, initially with bullish investors posting 7 taels, then 4 to 5 taels, a minimum of 2.5 taels, and then 6 taels, causing the market price to rise to 63 taels, closing at 62.5 qian, an increase of 8.5 qian from the previous day, with a daily fluctuation of 11.5 taels. On Wednesday, the large silver bar rebounded by 0.0625 to 0.125, American silver increased by 0.625, and shillings remained unchanged. The domestic market was loose. Gold exchange officially began swaps, initially with bullish investors posting 6 to 7 taels, a maximum of 17 taels, and then 10 taels. January had no trading. The opening price was 57 taels, and the closing price was 60.5 taels, a slight decrease of 1 tael from the previous day, as the February session began. The opening price was 47 taels, and subsequently bullish investors drove up the price, with eager buyers, estimated at 57.8 qian. At noon, it retreated to 49 taels. Suddenly, news emerged that France was using both gold and silver and minting currency, as well as purchasing pressure bars, causing anxiety. The closing price was 52 taels. The afternoon opened at 1.2 qian, and subsequently rumors of French aggression in Yunnan and Guizhou emerged, leading to fatigue and a decline to 39.5 taels, closing at 40.08 qian, approximately 11 to 12 taels lower than January (excluding the swap). On Thursday, the large silver bar increased by 0.375 to 0.3125, the silver price increased by 0.375, and shillings increased by one tier. The domestic market was also strong. Dealers engaged in both buying and selling. The bid gold opened at 40.5 taels, slightly lower by 3 qian, then retreated from 45.5 taels to 34 taels, as large accounts sold off, coupled with an oversupply of loose exchange rates. Subsequently, it fluctuated wildly, uncontrollably. The noon close was 41.2 qian. The afternoon opened at 46 taels. Mr. Wu bought in, raising the price to 54.5 taels. George Joseph then sold off, bringing it to 49.6 qian. News then emerged of Central Bank purchases, and rumors of a National Government lifting the gold ban, causing the price to soar beyond 20 taels, reaching 70.02 qian, mainly due to the outflow of cash from a certain bank. The closing price was 68.8 qian, a sharp increase of over 28 taels from the previous day, with a total daily fluctuation of 36.2 qian, which can be described as massive. Guangbang Hengxing alone aggressively purchased 5,000 contracts. On Friday, the large silver bar increased again by 0.1875 to 0.25, the silver price remained unchanged, shillings remained the same, and the US dollar decreased slightly by 0.25. The domestic market was loose in British currency and flat in American currency. The gold gang bought in to cover short positions and sold off to arbitrage, with arbitrage estimated at just over 30 taels. The gold market opened, declining slightly by 2.8 qian, to 66 taels, due to the continued rise in the large silver bar. Subsequently, the Central Bank intervened again, breaking through 7 taels, reaching 74.5 taels, then falling back to 62 taels, as sellers remained aggressive, but buyers persisted. Mr. Wu and others bought in, and with a firm exchange rate, the noon close was 72.7 qian. The afternoon opened at 69.5, and soon after, 63.5 taels, and with a small report from Bombay and rumors of continued Central Bank intervention, the price rose to 71.3 qian, closing at 67 taels, with Zhi Fengyong and others selling off, slightly lower by 1.8 qian from the previous day, with a total daily fluctuation of 12.5 taels. It is rumored that Hengxing bought in 2,000 to 3,000 contracts on behalf of the Central Bank. On Saturday, the large silver bar contracted by 0.0625 to 0.25, the silver price contracted by 0.875, shillings increased by two tiers and the US dollar contracted by 0.125, still due to exchange rate arbitrage. The domestic market was long in British currency and flat in American currency. The gold gang continued to sell off. The gold market opened, adding 2 taels, to 69 taels, then 3.5 taels, due to heavy selling. Subsequently, it retreated from 66.8 qian to 59 taels, as selling pressure intensified. Soon after, British-American Tobacco Company made a settlement, and large accounts chased the price up, surging by 10 taels, to 69.5 taels. At noon, it was 60.5 taels, and Zhi Fengyong, Yongfeng, Yifeng and others sold off, bringing it to 63.9 qian, closing at 61.8 qian, down 5.2 qian from the previous day, again suppressed to within 60 taels, leaving people feeling confused and unstable.</p>
<p>There was a fluctuation of 10.5 taels in half a day. The high and low prices of the British, American, and Indian silver markets and the British and American exchange rates are listed below:</p>
<p>Type | Highest | Lowest | Change from Previous Saturday</p>

<h3 id="e164">Foreign Silver Prices All See Rebound <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, news came from London that the large silver bar had rebounded, with the near term increasing by 0.0625, to 20 pence 0.4375, and the far term also increasing by 0.125, to 20 pence 0.5625. Chinese dealers made some purchases, with sparse transactions and a stable market. News also came from New York that the American silver price had also increased by 0.025, with the spot price at $0.31 and private telegrams also up 0.025, at $31.25. Market conditions were quiet. The British dollar strengthened against the US dollar by 7 fen, to $3.41, and the US dollar also strengthened against the British dollar by 4.5 fen, to $3.3925. The London-Shanghai shilling rose by 0.4375, to 2 shillings 0.0625. The Bombay spot price fell by 5 annas, to 63 Rupees 0.03 annas, and the far term also fell by 4 annas, to 63 Rupees 0.12 annas.

<h3 id="e165">Foreign Cents Continue to Decline <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>▲ Silver Exchange Remains Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the weekly holiday, the financial sector was quiet as usual. The market price of foreign cents in the market stagnated due to slow sales, and prices fell. The morning market was 7 qian 2 fen 1 li 7 hao and a half, and the afternoon market was the same price, continuing to be lower by 3 hao 7 and a half than the previous day's afternoon market. Silver exchange, on the other hand, was up 1 fen, estimated at 3 qian 3 fen, the same price in the morning and afternoon. Foreign exchange drafts were made for 310,000 in the morning and 435,000 in the afternoon. Banknotes in the market were only 15,000 in the afternoon. Outside the market, there were 90,000 in the morning and 30,000 in the afternoon. Banks were closed for the holiday and had no news. Qianzhuang foreign public bills collected over 6.5 million, and silver public bills collected over 43 million, likely because the day was the 20th, a comparison period, so it was more than usual Sundays. Small qianzhuang transactions were over 300,000. Jiangnan small foreign coins were 6 qian 4 fen 7 li in the morning and 6 qian 4 fen 8 li in the afternoon, with transactions of 3,000 jiao in the morning and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon.

<h3 id="e166">Securities Market: Bond Market Meanders Last Week <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>During the past week (from December 14th to 19th), the bond market conditions of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange in this city were quite active in the spot market, with lively trading. Except for the 96 Public Bonds, all bond types were opened. The total turnover for the week was 204,100 yuan, including 46,900 yuan for the 1919 Customs Bonds, 43,000 yuan for Consolidated Tax Bonds, 37,000 yuan for Salt Tax Bonds, 29,500 yuan for the 1920 Customs Bonds, 19,000 yuan for the 1919 Charity Bonds, and 4,000 to 5,000 yuan for each of the others. Additionally, bonds that had not been traded for a long time, such as Post-War Military Relief and Disaster Relief Bonds, each opened at 1,000 yuan at the end of the week. Futures were generally quiet, and the market was very idle, but the January futures for each bond type had all been opened, and turnover increased slightly. The average daily turnover for the past week was over 6 million yuan, except for Tuesday, which was only over 1.6 million yuan, and Monday, which was only over 3.4 million yuan. Thursday reached over 8.6 million yuan. The total turnover for the week was 32.11 million yuan, an increase of approximately 11 million yuan compared to the previous week, including 2.735 million yuan for the December Consolidated Tax Bonds, 2.5 million yuan for the January Consolidated Tax Bonds, 3.1 million yuan for the December Salt Tax Bonds, 2.005 million yuan for the January Salt Tax Bonds, 3.01 million yuan for the December 1920 Customs Bonds, 2.055 million yuan for the January 1920 Customs Bonds, 2.055 million yuan for the December 1920 Restructured Bonds, 1.15 million yuan for the January 1920 Restructured Bonds, 2.065 million yuan for the December 1919 Charity Bonds, 1.095 million yuan for the January 1919 Charity Bonds, 2.055 million yuan for the December 1919 Customs Bonds, 950,000 yuan for the January 1919 Customs Bonds, 2.47 million yuan for the December Disbandment Bonds, 60,000 yuan for the January Disbandment Bonds, 1.67 million yuan for the December Reorganization Bonds, 850,000 yuan for the January Reorganization Bonds, 460,000 yuan for the December 6% Bonds, 15,000 yuan for the January 6% Bonds, 575,000 yuan for the December Customs Duty Bonds, 65,000 yuan for the January Customs Duty Bonds, 675,000 yuan for the December 1996 Public Bonds, and 95,000 yuan for the January 1996 Public Bonds. In terms of trends, the restriction of price limits prevented free development, and market conditions were also affected. Market sentiment was chaotic regarding the bond market, and most people were observing. There were no large-scale inflows or outflows, and the supply and demand were balanced. The market prices of each bond type did not change significantly. Looking at the changes over the week, due to the hasty conclusion of the League of Nations on Monday without any significant achievements, and the continued implementation of aggressive policies by the Japanese without any remorse, the market was pessimistic about the future. Although there were no large-scale outflows, the buying interest was depressed, and demand was low. The prices trended downward from the previous weekend, and except for the 6% Bonds, Customs Duty Bonds, 1996 Public Bonds, and Disbandment Bonds, all other bond types fell to the predetermined minimum price limit. On Tuesday, all prices reached the price limit, and trading could not continue, so there were few inflows or outflows and minor fluctuations. However, on Wednesday and Thursday, there were political changes in the country. Ning and Yue cooperated, and Chiang and Zhang resigned successively. The Japanese cabinet was also reorganized, and the situation was refreshed for a while. Market sentiment was excited and optimistic about the future. Investment and buying were active, and demand increased. The market prices of each bond type rebounded sharply, with increases of approximately two yuan. The market situation suddenly became lively. However, on Friday and Saturday, the market slumped again. Various parties, in view of the domestic situation, noted that many things were not yet in place. Although the Japanese cabinet had been reorganized, the intention to invade remained unchanged. The increase in troops and aggression showed us that it was even worse. Therefore, people were uneasy, and prices trended downward again, gradually falling. By the weekend, each bond type had fallen close to the price limit again. As a result, there were only fluctuations of two or three yuan for the whole week, and compared to the previous week, the overall decline continued, but the amount was still small. It was noted that various parties found the price limit inconvenient, and had discussed with the Ministry of Finance to cancel it. However, if the market situation is not remedied and buying interest is encouraged, it is feared that there will be no turnaround for the time being. The following is a statistical list of the high and low fluctuations of each bond type during the past week (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e167">Yarn and Cotton: Last Week's Yarn Bidding Was Mediocre <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>▲ Spot Yarn Sales Were Very Scattered</p>
<p>The yarn market was very weak last week, with no signs of recovery. Due to the precarious national situation and tight credit, actual demand remained stagnant, and all parties were at a standstill. However, manufacturers, with limited bottom inventory, held firm this month and did not loosen, so the market was able to maintain. The spot yarn market saw a significant intention to purchase in large quantities from the Sichuan gang, but due to financial exhaustion, it was difficult to procure as much as possible. Spot yarn selling prices declined, and the price of 42-count fine yarn fell sharply by dozens of taels this week. The reason for this was the arrival of British goods in Shanghai, the rebranding of Japanese yarn, and the gradual increase in spot goods on the market. Moreover, previous selling prices were too high, and a decline occurred at the slightest sign of an unfavorable environment. The bid yarn situation was very bleak, and there were very few transactions in the market. The recent month price was up 1.6 qian from the previous week, and the distant month price was down 4 to 5 qian. The following is a list of the high and low prices and comparisons for the week:</p>
<p>Month | Highest | Lowest | Change from Previous Week</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>December | 154.0 | 150.2 | Up 1.6</p>
<p>January | 153.5 | 151.3 | 0.2</p>
<p>February | 153.7 | 151.9 | Down 0.5</p>
<p>March | 154.0 | 152.7 | 0.4</p>
<p>April | 154.2 | 152.9 | 0.4</p>
<p>May | 154.2 | 152.6 | 0.4</p>

<p>▲ Spot Cotton Mill Demand Was Quiet</p>
<p>The cotton market was even less exciting. Overseas conditions were very scattered, and exchange rates increased, leading to cheaper prices for imported cotton calculated in silver, so all mills purchased imported cotton, and the demand for domestic cotton was completely usurped. As a result, the market was at risk of trending down. However, a group of bullish investors, due to their very dry bottom inventory and the scarcity of domestic cotton production, held firm and did not loosen, so the market presented a stagnant situation that neither rose nor fell. However, the daily increase in Han Road and inland deliveries may temporarily prevent a decline. If imported cotton does not rise, there will be a drastic change in the future. The bid cotton transactions were very few, and the price of each month recently fell by 0.6 qian, while the distant months remained flat. American cotton was up 20 pound notes from the previous week. The following is a list of the high and low prices and comparisons:</p>
<p>Han Standard | Highest | Lowest | Change from Previous Week</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>December | 31.35 | 30.65 | Down 0.6</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially firmed due to active buying by powerful Wall Street accounts, but later weakened due to selling from some southern regions. Futures were up or down by one to four pound notes, and spot prices were up five pound notes. British cotton futures were up six to seven points, and spot prices were up seven points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton saw bullish investors taking profits and selling due to stronger exchange rates. Pingguoer rose by 5.75 Rupees, Yue Mula rose by 10 Rupees, and Bailuo Creek rose by 2.75 Rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (December 19th telegram):</p>

<p>8-gauge new lead wire sold for 9 taels and 2.5 qian per dan in the market yesterday, down 2.5 qian from before. The reason for the decline was the lack of procurement news from military and political circles, coupled with the suspension of business by foreign gangs, causing widespread anxiety, so the market price was unusually weak.</p>

<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>When Yu Dongfa was young, he was weak and sickly. He followed Mr. Li to Shanghai and sought out famous doctors, both Chinese and foreign, to diagnose and treat his madness. At that time, his cousin, Huang Mengwan, recommended him to a Japanese female doctor named Maruhashi for examination. Maruhashi was a middle-aged woman with a repulsive face, wearing wide sleeves and wooden clogs, a laughable sight. She held a stethoscope and examined his entire body, sometimes in deep thought, sometimes lost in contemplation, muttering to herself, not knowing what she was saying. She gave him a small bottle of medicinal water to apply to the affected area, which showed some effectiveness. It was probably a kind of insecticidal medicinal water. The following year, relations between China and Japan deteriorated, and Yu's madness recurred. He returned to Maruhashi for treatment, and the consultation fee suddenly doubled (2 yuan for a consultation, 4 yuan for a house call). Her attitude also changed drastically, becoming arrogant and unbearable, a stark contrast to her servile demeanor during his first visit. Although Yu was young, he tasted her contempt and was filled with anger. He stormed out and vowed never to see the ugly face of a Japanese woman again, preferring to be afflicted with madness. Later, he was cured by a Mr. Ding from Zhenjiang (a specialist in madness). His uncle once stroked Yu's back and smiled, saying, "This child is stubborn."</p>

<h3 id="e173">Anecdotes of Liu Yongfu <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Around the seventh or eighth year of the Guangxu reign (1881-1882), the French wanted to implement trade on the Red River. At that time, there was a leader of the Black Flag Party, Liu Yongfu, in name. In fact, he was a valiant general of the Taiping Army, originally from Qinzhou, Guangdong. In his youth, he wandered abroad, living near the border of Yunnan and Vietnam. As he grew older, he became a merchant in Vietnam, frequently traveling between Xuan Quang and An Binh. He generously distributed wealth and gathered a group of loyal and dedicated followers, numbering several hundred. When bandits rose up and invaded Bao Thang in Xinghua, the authorities of Xinghua, admiring Liu Yongfu as a hero, invited him to pacify the area. He then stationed troops in Bao Thang. Later, the Vietnamese King heard of Liu Yongfu’s accumulated merits and appointed him as the Deputy Commissioner of the Three Provinces (Xuan Quang, Xinghua, and Shanxi), entrusting him with the responsibility of defending the territory. When General Feng Zicai arrived in Vietnam, he found that Liu Yongfu was his fellow townsman and that Liu Yongfu possessed a heroic and outstanding spirit, he intended to bring him back to China. It was rumored that Feng had granted him the rank of a fifth-grade official. However, since Liu Yongfu had already been appointed to an official position and was heavily relied upon, this never came to pass.</p>
<p>As Commissioner, Liu Yongfu was allowed to collect taxes to support his troops. The French used this as an excuse, claiming it hindered trade, and successively captured Hanoi and other places. The troops stationed in Shanxi under Liu Yongfu were extremely fierce. Furthermore, the Governor of Yunnan, Cen Yuying, provided him with military supplies. Therefore, in his battles against the French, he repeatedly reported great victories to the court. The French feared him and instead sent troops to invade China. Vietnam also requested assistance. Consequently, Li Shaoquan was ordered to lead troops to assist. However, he first arrived in Tianjin and had already made an agreement with the French envoy, Binhai. At that time, Peng Yulin was in charge of coastal defense in Guangdong, while Tang Jiong, the Governor of Yunnan, was stationed in Shanxi, and Xu Tingxu, the Governor of Guangxi, was stationed in Beining. All were dismissed from their positions and arrested for questioning. Liu Yongfu's troops were also defeated. The French naval commander, Fulu Nuo, intended to drive out the Black Flag Army, but Shaoquan suppressed this and did not report it to the Emperor. Later, Liu Yongfu accepted the Qing court’s offer of amnesty and was also given the rank of Commissioner with the notation. He then recaptured the Three Provinces. Commentators at the time said, "The affair of the Southern Barbarians cannot be accomplished. If he loses, he will be annihilated by the French. If he wins, he will be resented by the Chinese generals. Retreating and advancing, he is in a difficult situation." There were those who privately felt concerned for Liu Yongfu. This was not without insight.</p>
<p>Alas, Liu Yongfu, with a solitary and isolated army, uniquely raised the banner of righteousness.</p>
<h3 id="e174">What I Saw and Heard <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Da Wei</p>
<p>Recently, I went to the countryside. A group of people surrounded me and asked about current affairs. I said, "The country is about to be destroyed." They said, "The flood has receded. This year's rice harvest is still good. How can the country be destroyed?"</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>Students in big cities are rioting with strikes. Stores in small cities are rioting with market strikes. The former wants to force the authorities to save the country. The latter forces the authorities not to save the country.</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>"If you boycott Japanese goods, Japan will naturally send troops to fight. It's like scratching an itch on a tiger's head, bringing trouble upon yourself." An old man was smugly lecturing. I suddenly understood the root cause of the country's destruction.</p>
<p>Resisting the French army with a mere few thousand newly gathered troops, repeatedly thwarting a powerful enemy, beheading generals and capturing flags, pursuing the defeated, causing anyone with any patriotism to rise up at the sound of his name, was unprecedented since the border affairs. Yet, the Qing court disparaged him, suspecting him of seeking undeserved credit or embellishing his reports as untrue and exaggerated, akin to causing panic. Therefore, during the Sino-French War, Liu Yongfu could only win and could not afford to lose. He could only advance and could not retreat. This was no different from abandoning a man of great talent and strategy to the jaws of a tiger, watching him perish without being able to help him. At the time, concerned individuals said, "This is enough to make all talented people in the world weep." This was truly not a false statement. In my youth, hearing Liu Yongfu's name, my ears would tremble. His reputation was no less than that of General Ma today. In Shanghai, photography was not yet prevalent, so among the Western-made portraits that were hung in homes, besides Zeng, Zuo, and Li, there was only Liu Yongfu. Observing his appearance, he was not yet fifty years old, his mustache had not yet fully grown, he looked like a handsome young man. He appeared physically weak, but his eyebrows and eyes revealed an extraordinary spirit. Initially, I thought he would be a towering and extraordinary figure, unlike ordinary people, but I did not expect that a naturally endowed hero could not be measured by appearances. Even so, the more I consider Liu Yongfu's time and circumstances, and the difficulty and hardship of his position, the more I cannot help but worry for General Ma today. Alas.</p>

<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>The sensational American tennis queen Madame Mallory once came to Shanghai. However, due to a slight indisposition, she did not perform publicly with Shanghai's tennis players. Speaking of Madame Mallory, her face always showed a smile, and her actions were very dignified and graceful. Her spirit and physique were full of a steely quality. Therefore, her strength, when performing tennis, would not be exhausted under any pressure. This was indeed a rare thing. Although she is now married, when people see her, they think she is a college student who still retains her maiden beauty.</p>
<p>When Madame Mallory came to Shanghai this time, she seemed to like this place very much. Therefore, after landing, her face was always full of smiles. Everything she saw seemed to make her marvel at the mystery of the Far East.</p>
<p>Madame Mallory's tennis achievements and the number of trophies she has won over the years are probably unmatched by anyone. When performing tennis in the women's team, her technique is skilled and her strength is sufficient. When she was a girl and had not thought about marriage, she was very young. One day, she went out alone and performed with a newly crowned tennis champion, without any color of panic. That</p>

<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>4.  In terms of the United Nations' personnel and administration, there is absolutely no equality. The League of Nations has three major organs: (1) the Secretariat, (2) the International Court of Justice, and (3) the International Labor Office. It is said that there are over a thousand employees in these three major organs. British and French nationals are the most numerous. There are only four Chinese in the Secretariat, and their positions are not important. There is not a single Chinese in the Labor Office. There is only Wang Chonghui in the International Court of Justice, which is relatively more important. There are also many Japanese, and they hold key positions such as various ministerial posts. The most regrettable thing is that sometimes the League of Nations consults Japan whenever it needs to inquire about Chinese affairs. The Japanese take this opportunity to use their glib tongues to conduct all sorts of counter-propaganda. It is truly absurd.</p>
<p>China's obligations to the League of Nations are in the same proportion as other countries, but the rights it enjoys are uniquely few. The government should protest against this unequal phenomenon.</p>
<p>We should have known long ago that the League of Nations is unreliable. We should not only know it now. Moreover, we should not still be timid and indecisive under such severe military pressure from Japan, relying on the League of Nations as our great support. That is why our diplomacy has suffered a complete defeat. There are many people who advocate withdrawing from the League of Nations now. In fact, considering the current situation, there are reasons why we cannot withdraw immediately.</p>
<p>(A) According to the Covenant of the League of Nations, any member state wishing to withdraw must give two years' advance notice. It cannot be decided on a whim.</p>
<p>(B) Before withdrawing, it must fulfill its obligations to the League of Nations. For example, our country still owes a lot in membership fees. We cannot withdraw until our obligations are fulfilled.</p>
<p>According to this situation, we really cannot withdraw. Even if we could withdraw, I don't think we should withdraw. Our country would be even more isolated internationally, and Japan would be able to act even more arbitrarily and unscrupulously. Like in recent conferences, Japanese representatives often found themselves at a loss for words and reason in front of a large audience, embarrassing the United States and all nations. Although it did not actually cause any damage, it was still embarrassing. Moreover, our country has always lacked the tools for international propaganda. The current Eastern Provinces Incident is largely due to the existence of the League of Nations, which focused the attention of countries around the world, and the truth has been revealed to the world. Therefore, joining the League of Nations is certainly not beneficial to us, but withdrawing from the League of Nations is even more beneficial to Japan. This is my humble opinion on why we should not withdraw from the League of Nations. However, after this major setback, our views on the League of Nations should undergo a major change, and from now on, we must know how to fully utilize the League of Nations so that we do not waste such a huge amount of annual membership fees.</p>
<p>performance did indeed gain a lot of experience. The reason why she was able to win the world tennis championship may be because she has a fearless spirit. In short, her tennis skills have now reached their highest limits.</p>
<p>Madame Mallory's success is of course half due to her talent. Her beauty, her courage, her intelligence. When she performs, she is able to resist powerful incoming balls and can return with even more powerful shots. Her counter-spin is especially effective. On the grass, she is really like a whirlwind, and her attitude is always relaxed, without any color of exhaustion. This time in Japan, she also defeated many famous tennis players. It is a pity that the Shanghai tennis fans cannot appreciate her skills.</p>

<p>(4) Leaving Nanxiang</p>
<p>Very early today (the 11th), we faintly heard the emergency assembly call. The comrades all woke up nimbly, competing to go to the meeting place to receive the commander's mobilization order. Before long, we were all prepared and set off towards Kunshan. At this time, the sun had not yet shone on the earth. The withered yellow roadside grass was ravaged by the night's cold dew, as if unable to bear its weariness. However, looking back at the state of the country, it was even worse than the roadside grass. My heart was filled with indescribable sadness.</p>
<p>At noon, we arrived at Anting. We were received by the Sanxian Rural Normal School, and the commander gave thanks to all sectors of society at the welcoming ceremony, and explained the purpose of this trip. After lunch, we set off to the west.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Kunshan, the county party headquarters and all sectors of society sent representatives to greet us at the station. Huge white cloth banners were hung on the station and along the road, all written with slogans welcoming or praising us. We stayed overnight at the County Middle School in the evening.</p>
<p>The scenery here is very good, and the road administration is also good. The customs are especially simple and honest. When the locals saw the coffin of the regimental spirit of our team, they were all surprised and whispered to each other. Some old and young men and women who understood our determination to eliminate the Japanese felt all the more unbearable when they saw this frightening thing, and frequently wiped their tears with handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>Military life is very unique. We do not feel its bitterness at all, but instead, our appetites have greatly increased, and we eat several more bowls of coarse rice.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Righteousness Above Family</p>
<p>"Ten thousand li to the battlefield, crossing mountains as if flying. The northern air transmits the sound of metal clappers, the cold light shines on iron armor." Zhongshu had already felt this scene and this emotion. Unexpectedly, Peng Meiguo's army arrived on the banks of the L River, and the H Province defense army on the opposite side had already destroyed the river bridge. The surging water was very vast, and it was impossible to fly across it for a while. They could only temporarily set up camp and wait. Peng Meiguo's headquarters was located in a Tiandao village more than ten li away from the river bridge. Peng Meiguo talked with his chief of staff and the Japanese officers for a long time in the evening. Feeling somewhat tired, he was about to go to sleep when he saw his daughter Zhongshu burst in from outside. Meiguo asked, "The weather is very cold, and the north wind is strong. Why haven't you gone to sleep yet?" Zhongshu said, "Hua Naiqiang has a secret matter to report to Father." Meiguo smiled slightly, "What secret does he have?" Just as he said the word "secret," the word "matter" had not yet been uttered, Hua Naiqiang had already jumped in from outside, holding a pistol high in his hand, aimed at Peng Meiguo and shouted, "Traitor, don't move!" Where did Peng Meiguo expect such a move? He was already frightened stiff. At this time, Hua Naiqiang was awe-inspiring, and said again, "Traitor, you are so muddled-headed, how can you be worthy of the country, worthy of your compatriots? You are leading this nameless army to serve as a tool for the tiger. You have lost all conscience. I have come for the sake of the country to carry out your death sentence. Today is your last day!" Peng Meiguo was greatly shocked. Just as he was about to shout loudly, he heard the sound of a gunshot, and Peng Meiguo had already fallen into a pool of blood. The two guards outside heard the sound and entered, but Hua Naiqiang shot them down one by one, finishing them off. Looking back at Zhongshu, he saw that she had already fallen on that old thief's body, sobbing. Naiqiang could not help but kneel down to her and said, "Madam, please forgive me. I had no choice but to do this. Now please stop your weeping. We need to discuss the aftermath." Zhongshu wiped away her tears and stood up, saying, "I have already agreed. This matter is for the sake of the country and the people. What is your fault? I only regret that my father was muddled-headed and senile, and was taken advantage of. That is why there is today's result. As his daughter, I could not persuade him to change his mind or stop his act of treason, which makes me deeply sad. Alas, since I cannot be Shen Yunying, nor can I be Gou Guan Niang, what else is there to say? Now, all matters should be carried out according to the plan that Brother Naiqiang agreed on before." Hua Naiqiang could not help but sigh to the sky. At this time, the horses of the Hu were neighing in the wind, and the sound of swords and fighting was silent. The scene before them was only solemn, and the lamplight was also dim. The two of them stood there, both feeling a special sensation.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Scattered Notes on a Concert <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Zhiyin</p>
<p>I saw advertisements twice, saying that a world-renowned Spanish violin master was performing in Shanghai. I didn't go the first time, but I did the second time, but it was already full. The third time, I rushed there alone at 8:30, but I still came in vain because I hadn't reserved a seat and there were no tickets left. But I decided to wait a while and see what happened. Sure enough, there were many foreigners waiting for tickets just like me who hadn't reserved a seat. So a Chinese ticket seller walked into the ticket window and started selling standing tickets, signing "Stand" on each ticket stub. I bought a standing ticket like that too.</p>
<p>The ushers were foreign girls, probably eighteen or nineteen years old, who seemed to be Russian. They were wearing plain khaki tops and tight, dark blue skirts.</p>
<p>I was standing by the railing behind the last seat. I treated the railing as a chair. Many foreigners and Chinese who had later standing tickets wanted to grab my spot but couldn't. I didn't leave from the moment I went in until the end. The girls came and went, ushering people in. Sometimes they bumped into my body, and I could hear a small, high-pitched "Sorry", and at the same time I could see a momentary cordial smile.</p>
<p>There were also plump and fat old women, as well as pot-bellied rich men, with the glitter of gold rings on their fingers and gold watch chains hanging on their bellies. Most of the young women had snow-white and tall fur collars and shiny black coats, with the long corners of their evening dresses trailing on the floor. Westerners respect all kinds of art very much. Look, they are going to a concert, and they are all wearing stiff evening dresses. There were also young men with long hair covering their heads, with eyes that seemed to have infinite thoughts, as if trying to explore something, but most of these were Chinese.</p>
<p>Several plump foreign ladies walked in, and a young man stood up from his seat to greet them. The foreign ladies stretched out their wrinkled hands, and the young man kissed each hand.</p>
<p>My watch pointed to 9:20. All the lights in the hall went out, and the electric lights in front of the stage were particularly bright. Then there was no sound at all. The air was completely quiet, so quiet that even breathing felt uneasy. I was so breathless by this silence that I didn't dare to breathe.</p>
<p>Heifetz, with his left hand holding a violin and his right hand holding a bow, walked out from the left of the stage. Two other people walked out at the same time behind him. The whole audience clapped and applauded. All three were wearing swallowtail evening dresses and bowed deeply to the audience at a ninety-degree angle.</p>
<p>The stage was very high. Behind it was a large gray curtain. A piano and a chair were quietly placed there long ago. The electric light shone on the piano surface, and then from the piano surface to people's eyelids. This was simply a picture, a clear and beautiful design picture.</p>
<p>Heifetz was a short, middle-aged man with very little hair. I was too far away to see clearly. His deep eyes were gentle and peaceful, and his manners were completely regular ninety-degree right angles, with an ironed evening dress.</p>
<p>The pianist was already half a hundred years old, with hair that seemed to be gray. He was hunched over, with his right foot stepping on the pedal and his left foot resting behind him in a human-like shape. His eyes were focused on the score, waiting for Heifetz's performance order. And in his consciousness, he didn't seem to know what was happening.</p>
<p>The other person was turning the pages of the music for the pianist.</p>
<p>There was no automation at all.</p>
<p>The piano was the first to sound, followed by the thin sounds of the violin.</p>
<p>The whole hall was completely quiet, except for the music, no one dared to make any noise.</p>
<p>The first piece was Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The piano accompanied the violin, mixing and playing together, from slow and quiet to fast and urgent, from light and thin to agile and quick... Then, in the wave-like vibrations of the whole room, all emotions were attracted, instantly making you forget yourself, lose consciousness, your heart beating for it, your face burning for it. Sometimes it was so sharp that you couldn't hear the sound, and you were so breathless that you couldn't breathe, your emotions were being driven to the highest point.</p>
<p>The piece was divided into three short sections, each section lasting a few minutes. After the sections, there was a rest, and many more latecomers were standing outside the door. Some people walked out one after another, probably because they were too suffocated and went out to get some air. The sound was still very quiet, with none of the noise of a theater. The people who came in later made no sound at all. The women walked on tiptoe, and the men, when they walked, didn't hear any sound at all. Then I noticed if they were wearing rubber-heeled shoes.</p>
<p>During the rest, several plump foreign ladies walked in, and a young man stood up from his seat to greet them. The foreign ladies stretched out their wrinkled hands, and the young man kissed each hand.</p>
<p>The rests were a total of two times. When the third music began, it was a quiet tune, but perhaps because of the hazy effect of a preconceived psychology, I felt that the feeling of the first session of the three concerts was the best and the impression was the deepest.</p>
<p>Every time a piece was finished, there was a burst of applause, and the applause was continuous. Then Heifetz and the pianist came out together and bowed several times to the audience. Sometimes Heifetz came out for a long time, and sometimes the bow was in the shape of a snake, quickly pointing its head downwards and then gradually raising it upwards, while the body also bent like this. Sometimes Heifetz had to come out and bow twice before the applause could stop.</p>
<p>After the last piece was finished, Heifetz and the pianist went back in. I didn't know if it was the end. Looking at the program, it was already over, but no one moved, and the applause was still noisy. Then Heifetz and the pianist went on stage again. This may have been a common custom in the West, that you can ask to hear an extra piece after the end of the piece.</p>
<p>The light and crisp tune of the violin played another piece. I immediately put on my coat, but people still hadn't moved, and the applause was still continuing. The applause of a young foreign man in the front row on the right was so loud that my ears were almost deaf. Several Chinese women had already stood up. I was a few foreigners who had walked to the door, and some people had already walked out.</p>
<p>Heifetz came out again and bowed, a ninety-degree bow, a snake-shaped bow, and then started the violin again, adding the slender bow to the strings. This may have been a small piece, a completely light, floating scale.</p>
<p>There was another burst of applause, mixed with a kind of floating shout, shouted in English, meaning to come again. Several Chinese people were also shouting, shouting the same as the foreigners.</p>
<p>The people in the front row had already stood up, followed by the people in the middle row. I immediately stood up too.</p>
<p>I passed through the crisscrossing cars, and it was already twelve o'clock at night.</p>

<h3 id="e180">The Waiter <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>It was almost four o'clock. I, Bin, and Xin happened to walk past the City God Temple, and Xin suggested, "We haven't had vegetarian fried noodles for a long time. How about going for a meal? Anyway, it's snack time now."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay," Bin and I both agreed, feeling that it was true, we hadn't tasted vegetarian fried noodles that were as delicious as meat fried noodles for a long time. At the same time, our stomachs were rumbling a bit. The three of us walked towards ××× in unison.</p>
<p>The dishes at ××× are said to be lighter and fresher than other places,</p>
<p>and the portions are not small, so when we are in the City God Temple and want to eat vegetarian dishes and noodles, we must go to ×××. Although there are many vegetarian restaurants in the City God Temple.</p>
<p>We slowly walked up the stairs of the ××× restaurant and saw that there were not many people eating, so we casually sat down at a table by the window.</p>
<p>A very fat waiter, seeing us sitting down, rushed over, dusted the table with a white cloth on his shoulder a few times, and then took out chopsticks while saying very politely, "Miss, what dishes do you want?"</p>
<p>"A stir-fry..." I was slowly saying, when Xin stopped me, "We only need two bowls of Three Delicacies Fried Noodles."</p>
<p>The fat waiter, hearing "two bowls of fried noodles," turned around and walked to the stairs, shouting what we wanted loudly.</p>
<p>After he shouted, he poured three cups of tea. At this time, he was not as happy as before, he was almost wearing a straight face, putting the three cups of tea on the table and walking away.</p>
<p>Bin took a cup, raised it and said, "Look, there are a lot of dirty dregs in this tea. I'm going to exchange it for a cup of plain water. Do you want it too?"</p>
<p>Xin and I shook our heads and said, "We don't want tea or plain water."</p>
<p>Bin then raised his hand and said to the fat waiter standing on the side, "Come, change a cup of tea."</p>
<p>"What?" he stood in front of him very unhappily.</p>
<p>"This tea is very dirty, go and exchange it for a cup of plain water."</p>
<p>"Plain water is the same as this cup of tea, because this tea is also made with plain water." He made an indifferent expression, with his hands hanging at his sides, not showing any intention to exchange it, his attitude was very cold, motionless staring at Bin.</p>
<p>"Then don't worry about whether it's the same or not, just go and exchange it for a cup of plain water." I said slightly angrily, he glanced at me askance, also slightly angrily, poured the cup of tea into the spittoon beside our table, and then quickly walked away.</p>
<p>"This kind of waiter is really snobbish, he initially thought we were big spenders, so he treated us very politely, but when he found out that we were only eating one or two bowls of fried noodles, he was greatly disappointed and made this contemptuous attitude," Bin said.</p>
<p>"Although we are not afraid of his scorn, I think we should also stir-fry a few dishes to eat, what do you think?" I said, when I thought that it was rare for us to walk past the City God Temple.</p>
<p>"Okay, then what dishes do you like to eat?... Do you like stir-fried yam?" Xin looked at us.</p>
<p>We ordered a few dishes, then Xin waved and shouted, "Come!" This time, the waiter probably already knew that we were going to order a few dishes, he seemed to be less contemptuous of us than before.</p>
<p>"Stir-fry a few more dishes, a stir-fried yam, a stir-fried vegetable heart, a stir-fried assorted vegetables, half-sold is fine." The waiter showed a slight smile, nodding repeatedly and saying, "Understood, understood." This time, he seemed to be very respectful to us.</p>
<p>The dishes were brought one by one, and we ate them one by one. Bin had the smallest appetite, he was the first to stop eating, sitting next to us and waiting. At that time, the fat waiter came again, swaying, he first handed Bin a hot steaming towel and then said, "Do you still want plain water?" His peaceful attitude and words seemed to be asking for forgiveness for his rudeness just now.</p>
<p>After we had finished eating, we called him to calculate the money, "Thirty-one, forty-eight, fifty-three... including small accounts, a total of two yuan, thirty-five cents." He calculated very quickly.</p>
<p>We paid him two yuan and forty cents, and told him not to give us the change, he said humbly, "Miss, thank you." As we straightened our clothes and started to walk down the stairs,</p>
<p>"There are many of these lowly people. Getting a few more coins is like a greedy dog getting a piece of beef from a stranger's hand, it will wag its tail and show its diligence," Xin sighed, after walking out of ×××.</p>
<p>"Ah, why should people be slaves to money? Having money will definitely also get troubles. The waiter just now thanked us, but we coldly didn't even turn our heads back, as if we hadn't heard it. Just think, isn't this also embarrassing him?"</p>
<p>"But you don't know if he would rather be embarrassed than not get money," I said, while also sympathizing with the waiter, because he was originally this kind of person. Only getting money, he is willing to endure anything. What person is struggling without money?"</p>

<p>Spring Love Holiday</p>
<p>If society is corrupt, it should be criticized. If youth is decadent, it should also be criticized. Because this is like the "one word of condemnation" in the Spring and Autumn Annals, making ugliness nowhere to hide, nowhere to be concealed, and nakedly presented before people, giving them such an ugly object to fiercely impose the most severe surveillance, and can also give both sides a new opportunity for improvement, making the corrupt aware of innovation and eliminating the influence on urban civilization, making the decadent stand firm and refuse to abandon themselves from humanity. So-called urban civilization is built on people's reason, emotion, passion, and material things, and absolutely does not allow social corruption or youthful decadence to shake its foundation. If it unfortunately reaches this point, artists must quickly rise up to realize the mission of art to seek all improvements. "Spring Love" (Holiday), a film recognized as very successful in the American film industry, its theme is built on such a concept.</p>
<p>America, the youngest country in the world, on the surface, in our eyes, everything is active. However, exploring its inner workings makes one realize that for the sake of erotic pleasure, romantic life, and excessive material possessions, society is actually harboring the evils of corruption, and youth has decadent manifestations. These are shaking the foundations of urban civilization, are harming the will of youth, are hindering the soundness of the country, and are preventing the strength of the nation. It is indeed a huge potential crisis, a very serious situation where artists must quickly rise up, like rushing to the embankment to prevent a river, and do their best to exercise the mission of art. Thus, the sharp-eyed, intellectually rich, emotionally passionate, nationalistic artists in Hollywood, aware of the future collapse and today's dangerous situation, resolutely take on the responsibility that artists should have for the nation and the country, and exercise the mission of art in criticism. RKO Radio Pictures then produced "Spring Love," a film that benefits society and touches people's hearts.</p>
<p>A purposeful nation is truly admirable, constantly concentrating and dedicating itself to doing such preventative work, making the nation's walls as solid as iron. At the same time, it incessantly pays attention to and removes rust, and repairs the walls. In contrast, our Chinese nation's surroundings are surrounded by fences full of dog holes, and no one has ever paid attention to them. It truly makes people wring their hands and beat their chests, deeply lamenting their own people's lack of ambition. We have issued many, many calls for years, but the listeners all seem numb and indifferent, and even those with the title of artist are degenerating. How can this prevent the brutal Japanese from invading the Northeast? Ah, lack of ambition, lack of ambition.</p>
<p>"Spring Love," of course, cannot leave the issue of love like other films, but the transcendence of the theme makes people deeply admire it. The theme is about how an aspiring young man does not have no future just because he has no money in front of him, and only a young man who is rich but decadent has no place in the world. An old man owns wealth and has two daughters and a son. The son is decadent, indulging in wine, and the elder daughter is also decadent, becoming a wanderer. These are all harmed by money. The younger daughter meets a young man. Although the young man is not so poor that his family has no bread, his exhaustion in his career does make him inevitably expose his financial difficulties. However, his ambition cannot be bent, and he finds new joy in love, and the joy of the romantic period gives him a boost in his career. However, the sea of love always has storms, and it is really not easy to sail smoothly. Under the old man's machinations, a rift in love is seen, because the old man's younger daughter eventually finds him disposable. However, the young man will not despair. His plan actually touches the heart of the old man's eldest daughter, and she rises from decadence, looking forward to the journey of her career and moving forward with him. Only the unpromising younger brother remains decadent.</p>
<p>Why is the title called Holiday? Because the focus of the story is on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Therefore, the corruption of society is criticized as much as possible, and the decadence of youth is attacked as much as possible.</p>
<p>The protagonist of the film is the renowned Ann Harding, and the supporting cast is also renowned, Mary Astor. Ann Harding plays the old man's eldest daughter, purely expressing the various stages of life of the character in her expressions: romance, decadence, melancholy, activity, and hope are all revealed in her expressions as much as possible. Coupled with her graceful figure, she becomes even more lovable and pitiful. Mary Astor is also not to be outdone, and her increased sensuality further enhances her beauty. In short, in addition to the theme that makes people appreciate this film, the two female stars make people feel a very strong interest.</p>

<p>No wonder its opening business in New York exceeded expectations.</p>

<h3 id="e184">The Political Organizations of Various Countries in the World by Mori Sen <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Politics is the mechanism for maintaining social order. If political achievements are good, human life can be stable. If they are bad, human life falls into hardship. Therefore, the progress and development of society is also hindered, and it is impossible to know whether the country will be destroyed. From this, it can be seen that to make social order peaceful, there must be good political organizations. Those who want to study the world situation or social relations must be familiar with the political organizations of various countries. Over the years, the political organizations of various countries in the world have changed into various systems with the changes in history. The twentieth century is the central era of material civilization, science, and culture, and the way of politics is worthy of attention. Especially under the current situation in China, foreign troubles are pressing in, and domestic politics are still corrupt. Looking back at various countries in the world, they are changing their political organizations according to the environment, which is indeed enough to make us take it as a "stone from another mountain." So it becomes meaningful for me to introduce this book.</p>
<p>This book is compiled and translated by Mr. Liu Bomin, and it includes the political situation of more than 60 countries in the world, from the national system, political system, parliamentary system, electoral system, judicial organs, administrative organs to the local system, with detailed outlines, which can be used for general reference. This book not only describes the domestic political situation, but also includes the history of the establishment of the national system, so that readers can find clues from a causal relationship, unlike the direct narrative method of ordinary books. This book completely uses the method of warp and weft, explaining everything in a coherent manner, so that readers can read it consistently, not only understanding the domestic political organization of the country, but also understanding why the country is organized in such a way, and the relationship between various countries in the world.</p>
<p>Often when we see a change in the political system of a certain country in the newspaper, we only have a faint image in our minds and do not study further problems. In fact, the change in a country's political organization is not accidental, but inevitable. If we can understand its current political organization, then we will not suspect that future changes are out of the blue. Therefore, in the current era of economic recession and the rising tide of revolution, the authorities often cannot maintain the status quo, and the political organization is changing rapidly. Being able to spare a little time to look at the political organizations of various countries in the world is especially an urgent matter.</p>
<p>For example, in the recent Eastern Province incident, most Chinese people still do not understand who initiated this incident, or do not understand how Japan passed this kind of bill. This is really because they do not understand the political organization of Japan. Therefore, they may misunderstand that it was Nan Lu Xiang's arbitrary actions, or General Kanaya's plan. If you read this book, you can fully understand. The book provides a detailed analysis of Japan's political organization, such as the mutual relations and tasks of the Emperor, advisory bodies, Minister of the Interior, Privy Council, Cabinet, Weiyi Shangzou organs, and the National Assembly. It clearly states them separately, so that readers will not misunderstand that after seeing a certain abnormality in politics, it is just an accidental microbubble in the political tide, but can actually understand the origin, background, and trend of the situation.</p>
<p>This book is divided into seven sections. The first section is a general discussion of (1) human life and politics, (2) the historical changes of politics, and (3) the general situation of politics in various countries. It explains that in order to make politics good and life stable, everyone must be able to understand politics, and it says that because everyone hopes for good politics and stable life, frequent political changes have occurred. Next, it discusses the general situation of world politics. The author says, "We have examined the political process from the past, and how many failures have occurred, and how many unreasonable politics have been experienced. Now it seems that we have reached some progress in politics." He also says, "After the Great War in Europe, the number of republics increased to fourteen, which is more than the twelve monarchies. Now there are already thirty-nine republics in the world, accounting for more than 60% of the number of countries in the world. Looking back at the political situation a hundred or two hundred years ago, it cannot be said that there have been great changes." This kind of historical statistics shows the characteristics of this book, knowing how painstakingly the author hopes for "removing the old and creating the new." Therefore, in addition to giving readers an image, this book can also give readers excitement, to the point that they may not feel that he is describing it in a ledger style, but make people interested in reading it. The second section is Europe, the third section is Asia, the fourth section is North America, the fifth section is South America, the sixth section is Oceania, and the seventh section is Africa. Only China is missing, which is because the people of this country always know their own political organization. At the same time, it is also giving the people of this country an implication, because it allows us to see the good political organizations of other countries, and to reform the politics of our country. Recently, I heard that the political organization of our country is about to undergo some changes again. I hope that readers will read this book first, and then have some understanding of the politics of this country and make some contributions, which is really an urgent task at present.</p>
<p>After reading this book, you can fully understand the current state of the political organizations of various countries in the world, but what will they be like in the future? This is certainly what we are anxious to know. This book also includes some introductions, because his words are so correct and powerful, so I do not mind repeating them here. He said, "European countries, whether monarchies or republics, are countries with extremely complex social problems. That is, in politics, countries where significant manifestations have already occurred, the activity rate of their politics is dominated by the Socialist Party and parties related to the Socialist Party, which is a phenomenon showing that the popularization of politics is still in progress. Compared with the political situation in the early twentieth century, it has already been a radical change. The great purpose of politics is to implement social policies earlier than those who are aware of it, so as to avoid gradual realization today. Striving to complete social policies and stabilize the lives of the majority of the people is the most important and urgent task today..." Therefore, we know that the trend of politics is gradually moving towards his path of progress, but how should the politics of this country be improved is a matter worthy of research. I hope that readers can first read this book to know what the world's politics are like, and then go on to explore the improvement of this country's politics, which may be more profound and practical.</p>
