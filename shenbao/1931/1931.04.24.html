<h3 id="c25">自殺與殺人 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>均足以促人類之反省</p>
<p>近時每有自殺之案披露。探其原曰。爲經濟所迫。夫爲經濟所迫。無法自救。以至於自殺。此自暴自棄之懦夫也。然反其意以推測之。豈不得謂爲世界社會之不公不平。彼乃不惜一死以促人類反省之勇士乎。此非我尊崇自殺之謂也蓋自殺之道。誠非一端。古人所謂酖酒婦人。今日各國之政治犯。每有絕食以表示寗死不屈之精神者。不得謂非自殺之一種也。茲據路透電所傳。日本染織公司之男工二百人。自星期日絕食。以反對公司開除工人一名。謂非俟公司復收開除之工人後。决不進食。似此絕食之舉。豈非等於自殺。此種自殺。豈非促人類反省一據乎。</p>
<p>因此連類而思及德殺人犯彼得古藹登彼得古藹登。茲已判定死罪。少婦少女及男子之死於彼手者。已有九人之多。詢其所以殺人之故。則謂不過以殺人爲戲之一種衝動。並無別意云云。夫使人類而以殺人爲戲之衝動。而即以殺人至九人之多。則人類殘酷性之暴露。於是已極。無怪暴戾兇狠之氣。遍於世界。是又人類對之而當反省者也。</p>

<p>小觀園之總園。余往游者屢矣。獨江灣之分園。以地稍偏僻。自去秋開評菊會時。偶一戾止。迄將半載。無暇涉足其間。日前園主楊君瘦蒓。以園中桃李盛開。仙客來又在爭妍鬥麗之際。尙足一騁游賞。特於星期日。設筵園中。預約吳子蓮洲。邵子亦羣。田子寄痕。及鄙人等。作永日之游。先是錢君濬川。有在五芳齋早點取齊之說。限七時至八時。余以條約太苛。與亦羣議不參加。獨分道揚鑣而往。直至時近午分。始達目的地。是日天氣雖未放晴曦。幸宿雨已霽。猶足鼓人游興。一路領略郊外風光。亦自別饒韻味。迨將臨園門。瞥見天空一鷹。正翱翔作摩雲勢。余與亦羣。方深驚異。入門。始知爲畫家張君光宇。在彼作風籲之戲。少選。蓮洲自內出。遙見余儕。喜而呼曰。吃客來矣。余稍延竚。即巡游花圃一周。果見嬌艷怒放之仙客來。絢爛如錦。數畦花胵。皆新栽名種菊秧。有一處。則如簾幕低垂。衡宇相望。中植高逾及肩之牡丹各一叢。含苞纍纍。不知凡幾。雖已破萼者。亦僅好花看到半開時光景。雖曰春寒料峭。花訊未免愆期。然有此大好名花。髣髴如十七八新嫁娘。全體籠罩蟬翼輕紗。掩映生姿。勝於輕以色相示人者多多矣。聞瘦蒓云。此牡丹兩叢。已歷數十寒暑。非近今所易覯。向爲某巨姓園中故物。因房屋重建。無此閒地。足容位置。此兩枝代價。幾以中人之產購來。苟欲更覓相似者。恐非倍値。不易謀矣。是日席間。田君寄痕酒興獨濃。竟與隔席之汪君永康。錢君濬川。一再狂浮大白。令人詫爲異事。或曰。田君新有藏嬌之喜。故意興勃勃。不可嚮邇。似聞有於下星期日假座園中。作宴客之舉。不惟愛其地點隔絕塵囂。或亦熟讀西廂曲文瞞過夫人之句耳。是晚。余以在園作雀戰。獨遲散。復承楊君以汽車相送。臨行。並餉余異卉多盆。乃偕花枝招展而歸。故此游殊堪爲之一紀云。</p>

<p>數年前海上有三小。頗傳譽於社會。而以小抖亂葉仲芳爲最著。近三小久不露臉。各從事於前途之事業。詎小抖亂葉仲芳竟爲戀一嫦娥舞塲舞女陳秀珍（又名雪莉）而對簿公庭。茲將昨日開審時所見。除各報已載者外。記其瑣屑如下</p>
<p>趙光祖旁聽　曾一度戀妓梅妃而被妻譚眉影提起離婚訴訟。結果夫婦已言歸於好之趙光祖。與葉爲知己。是日亦駕車蒞法院旁聽。事後趙對人言。「現在的舞女。祇愛金錢而無愛情。」恐亦有感而發也。</p>
<p>法院職員全體出席　按是日適値法院案件不多。人素慕葉名。由是羣來旁聽。其盛况不亞雪蝶解約案。</p>
<p>安神片失效　自陳訴葉案發生後。葉頗懊喪雅不願雙方對簿公庭。有傷厥心。遂改名隱入北平軍校。後見報上記其事實。並得其江一平律師電促。遂於審前趕到。惟葉仍不願見陳。作一死了之之計。於審前二十分鐘。呑阿特靈安神片十枚。冀在庭上當塲畢命。詎料片下。非特無效。反提精神。方得盡其欲言。事後葉對人言。此乃祖宗有知。暗中相佑云。</p>
<p>十五元永銘心版　當葉與陳發生肉體關係之夕。葉囊中祇剩十五元。耗費以後。囊已空空。然陳非不向之要索。反供給其茶飯等等。心中爲之大感。以爲此乃天下唯一之情人。遂興同居之意。結不解之緣。</p>
<p>情深一往　庭訊畢。江一平勸葉。謂觀現在情形。君可憬然而悟。然葉答曰。余始終愛彼。即欲離我他適。必决不阻止。惟希望其珍重前途。毋適非人。則我雖流亡他鄕。死亦瞑目也。</p>
<p>死前狂歌浪舞　開審前。葉旣存一死之心。遂於前一夜。在黑貓舞場大開香檳。狂歡極樂。作最後一次之開懷。聞一夕所費。達二三百金。可知其傷心已極。金錢全不在意矣。</p>
<p>訟事之火線　陳自入葉宅。頗爲優待。即大婦亦稱以妹妹。葉母稱之爲小姐。某日廚子進膳。陳以味惡。告葉擬將其停職。葉母謂。世風日非。生手不如熟手。陳以爲薄己厚廚也。憤而一去不返。馴至入訟。彼廚子可謂導火線矣。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>十八日余受馬史大教授之指示。始用塗身油。此油似亦平常之油。即各點心店可以買而用一種藥以和之。此藥英名Camphor孟回拉土音名戈包。即中國之樟腦也。加以花椒粒。可於餅中貯藏。樟腦油可擦身上各處。去濕氣及一切皮膚病。因此地濕熱盛。雖冬令夜微寒。亦可蓋被。而日間仍單衣。數日不冷浴。則身發癢。今已冬令。而余身上尙起熱痱。用各種貴藥尙未能消除之。至下午即作癢。盧領事夫人云。彼等來時正當熱季。身起熱痱余用此藥塗甚見效。發淸凉。若到印度者。務注意此事。關係不小也。又可避穢惡。按中國樟腦出在江西福建。余往年由韶關北上。路見樟腦樹甚多。江西友人云。可熬此樹以製樟腦。獲利無窮。法亦甚簡單。用機器製。十萬以上資本即可。此利現日本人擅之也。按樟樹生近熱帶地。而人來熱地者。亦須用之。余近始感覺印度生活之怪異。而悟法華經所說。與塗足油者。誠爲需要。此地身足不塗油不可也。惟印度人塗法有種種花色。當是更有種種藥及染色。或染於額。作種種形狀公然遊行。久之成爲一種宗風矣。緬甸婦人之塗面。亦同此理。蓋生長熱帶之需要也。</p>
<p>二十日。同道階師觀亞洲學會。在公園路。一西藏人領導參觀。因將過年無辦公者人少。此會性質爲亞洲各民族研究學術之公會。但事實上已歸英政府經濟支配。其主任爲荷蘭人。當秘書。其下各國均有代表。搜集各國文書圖器。以資研究。古今文字分類列置。其書架均用鐵架。不用書箱。熱帶貴通風。大抵如此也。余略一省覽。見其有中國經書。道藏佛典均有。而藏人示余多限於西藏一部。藏人名查延。Jumyang光頭。紫馬褂。紫袍。道師云。此即緇衣出家人服也。示余藏文字母及韵學。余讀之。剛剛與中國四字韵同。知印度反切音韵之學。惠我中國多矣。中國反均從印度來。也日本僧空海創伊呂波字。亦仿印文。藏文亦然。蒙又仿藏文。蒙人欲爲名僧。非派人留學西藏不可。然則聲音一道。印度爲亞洲大師矣。馬史大教授曾告余。印度古文化得克利須那之力不少。印語克利即猶太人稱耶蘇之爲克賴師梯。同一字而長音短音之異也。余不知果同源乎。</p>
<p>讀西藏各種英文調查書。而歎英人之敢於謀藏者。非偶然矣。其對於西藏之整部分部。均有專人調查。有英藏語大字典値三十二盧布。有一九二二及二三與二四年繼續調查厚冊報告。均在倫敦出版。附有各種圖畫。於民族風俗物產種種記載無遺。我茫然不知。也我國有名學者大政治家。亦茫然不知也。何所恃而與人爭哉。記昔時常有人評華人之自知。遠不如外人之知我。眞傷心之言也。雖然。蓋有由矣。中國人之昧於遠略。一因國內之不自知遑知外。一因數千年君主國人民無結合之習慣。社會獨力發起之事甚少。無社會組織經營之能力。三又無政府之補助津貼。革命已二十年。各省政府所耗於戰爭之欵無量萬。曾有爲獎勵學術發明之用者乎。甚矣各省政府中無人才也。無常識也。</p>

<p>船身破壞　華陽輪於二十一日下午二時半遇霧、駛至東經一百二十二度又十四分·北緯二十八度又五十一分半、在南漁山北部西北角極端處、船身在霧中、觸入暗礁、撞入該輪左舷三十度、因碰擊力過甚、立即破裂、海水便狂冲入船、此際船主十分着急、眼見輪船立時下沉、便向礁上開去、希望將船擱上礁灘、免使員客不及救護、結果、船頭開入礁山脚上、即行擱住、而船尾則在海內、得以從容救援員客上山、經過二十四小時之久、方始沉沒、惟船底受礁石撞穿、破裂至不堪言狀、</p>
<p>救客困難　招商局公平輪、開赴馬鞍島援救華陽、係在二十一日下午五時五十分、遙望海水已上華陽甲板、船後尾完全沉沒、僅留一頭艙在外、船員搭客、悉在南漁山上、公平輪放舢板輪兩艘、第一次下海、爲北風大浪打翻、第二次再放下、又被巨浪激覆、且有舢板一隻、被浪擊破船頭、水手一名、幾至喪生、無法往救、祇得退回守候、大英公司一萬六千噸巨輪拉乾浦太乃號到來、公平始請其代爲救援、</p>

<p>楊虎險遭毒手</p>
<p>共黨引誘司閽謀殺楊氏</p>
<p>吳有才捕獲後供認不諱</p>
<p>同黨時有恒三人亦就擒</p>
<p>國聞社云、國府對軍楊虎、自退任淞滬警備司令職後、寓居法租界環龍路、對於軍政、似未甚聞問、詎共黨深恨楊氏過去仇讎、竟起暗算之心、無如楊氏防護嚴密、無從下手、浸至最近、楊宅僱用之司閽、乃被誘惑加入共黨、暗殺楊氏之事發生、幸覺察得早、未遭毒手、茲將謀害經過、彙誌如下、</p>
<p>平日戒備　楊虎字嘯天、安徽寗國人、初隨孫總理奔走革命、備嘗艱險、旋國軍奠定江浙後、蔣主席任楊氏爲淞滬警備司令職、不久寗漢分裂、楊氏深恨共匪、立志剷除、共匪在當時已恨楊如刺骨、因之數年來楊氏之戒備、無日不在嚴厲中、楊氏每出、除僱備衛護者外、並身儲左輪駁壳槍兩桿、以資自衛、防遭宵小之危害、</p>
<p>匪不得乘　匪覩楊氏戒備之嚴、無機可乘、乃改變方針、擬引誘其左近之人、賄以巨金、乘間去楊、故最近匪黨中、異常活動、並對楊氏頗爲注目、聞黨中近竟有「楊氏不去、共黨永不能爲所欲爲」之口號、輾轉設法、因楊氏有司閽名吳有才者、江浦人、竟被誘惑、加入共黨、助彼同謀、詎天網恢恢、事經楊宅家人覺察破綻、立命市公安局派警擒拿、於本月二十一日俯首就擒、</p>
<p>破獲經過　吳有才供職楊宅以來、業將年餘、平日勤愼、且除在職時間不外出、故楊氏之視吳有才、亦甚器重、屢加贊許、至近日吳竟一變常態、遇外出則長夜不歸、叩其何處去、彼亦模糊其辭、家人以司閽職責、關繫闔宅安全、縱有事故、何至漏夜不返、且門禁無人叩應、於是疑慮之心、油然而起、某日覩吳外出、則密派人員暗中隨探、嗣以其行跡可疑、有與匪晤商之嫌疑、遂報之楊氏、由楊氏函知市公安局長陳希曾、派警將吳捕獲、押局審訊、</p>
<p>供認謀害　吳於廿一日被捕後、公安局以案關謀害黨國要人、立加審訊、結果、吳亦自知難隱、和盤托出、其供詞最要一點、有言「我自加入共黨之後、同黨每欲得楊而甘心、因防維之嚴不得逞、頃奉共匪之命、意圖暗殺楊氏」不諱云云、同時幾經詳訊、並招出同黨時有恒·朱楝祥·羅起亭·等多名、亦已捕獲、現該局連日在嚴訊中、並嚴緝其他餘黨、</p>

<p>— 一瞬</p>
<p>彷彿是在夢裏、窗外絲絲的細雨、輕微地敲着樹葉、一種富有詩意的淸響、在黑暗之夜裏充滿着、忽地、鐵仗碰擊石塊發出「喞喞」的聲音、從我迷糊的記憶中驚醒過來、我懶洋地睜開惺忪的睡眼、只見黝黑的房子裏、突然展開了意想不到光亮、「呀、這不是電筒射進來的光輝嗎、」我暗地裏喊着、</p>
<p>誰都會覺得奇怪而驚人、在這更深人靜之際、窗外有人射起電筒、而且有鐵器的聲響、一種莫名其妙的恐怖、緊緊在我底周身、於是我火速地穿上了背心起來了、</p>
<p>「民、醒來、醒來、有什麼變故了、……」</p>
<p>我推着問房間的吳君、但喉頭有些不自然、</p>
<p>「什麼……什麼……」他驚惶地問、</p>
<p>「你沒有聽見外面鐵仗拖過的聲音嗎、剛纔、」</p>
<p>「什麼、鐵仗、」</p>
<p>「是的、鐵仗、還有永備電筒到處照射着、起來看看怎樣一回事呢、」</p>
<p>「我怕、老張……剛纔我在夢裏看見一個血淋淋的屍身、在麥田裏、今晚的不幸的變故、也許是夢裏給我的預兆吧」</p>
<p>「怕什麼呀、我們又沒有殺死誰人的父母、起來吧、勇敢些、」</p>
<p>吳君被我催迫不過、於是披上了外套、我們各自携着一種畏懼而神秘的思潮、祈待着不幸的事情來臨、</p>
<p>四野暗黑得有些怕人、一切的聲音都被黑夜之神呑噬了、惟有輕風吻着柳枝發出嬌柔的微聲蕩漾於寂寞的空氣中、我和吳君一聲不響地在宿舍四圍尋覓一件什麼珍貴東西似的窺望、</p>
<p>「看、前面不是有一團黑影向我們挨近嗎、」</p>
<p>我低聲地向吳君說、</p>
<p>「是的、是的、那我們怎樣辦呢、」他似乎有些害怕了、</p>
<p>「我們上前探問明白就是了、」</p>
<p>「…………………………」</p>
<p>「誰、」是密司們的聲音在追問、隨後便以電筒射過來、</p>
<p>「我、我、」我倆快步的走向她們、</p>
<p>「密司陳、密司王……你們找的什麼東西、這樣久的時候了、」我問、</p>
<p>「輕些、密司脫張、今晚有搗亂份子要燒死我們呢……」</p>
<p>「昨天晚上我們檢到許多稻草和浸過火油的棉紙、今晚我們也檢到很多、如果我們不犧牲睡覺、也許全體同學都會被這些狠心的搗亂份子燒死了呢、」密司陳沒有說完話便被素來擅長口才的密司李搶着說了、</p>
<p>「那末、這個消息從那得到的呢、」我懷疑的問、</p>
<p>「前日你們男生宿舍旁邊放着幾箱蜜蜂、不是無緣無由地燒起來嗎、那時我們都去晚餐了、所以不知道誰下的毒手、後來又聽到有少數不良份子要燒毀全部房屋呢、因此、我們大家不能不小心去注意了、」密司陳很憤懣地說、</p>
<p>「你們僅僅幾個人、不怕嗎、」吳君說、</p>
<p>「怕什麼、怕的是看不見他們！那些搗亂份子、」密司李說、</p>
<p>「你們難道整夜都不睡覺嗎、這眞太苦了、」我担心地問</p>
<p>「整夜都要巡的、不過上半夜下半夜二班、每班有八九人、你們男同學也一樣的、」密司李答我</p>
<p>「好、繼續你們的工作吧、但得當心意外的不幸、」</p>
<p>「謝謝、」她們說着做她們工作去了、</p>
<p>她們一個個都非常奮勇地四處巡察、有的執木棍、有的執鐵仗、有的執電筒、各人的臉上照舊紅暈、毫無絲縷畏懼之色、</p>

<h3 id="e25">Suicide and Homicide <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Both Sufficient to Prompt Human Introspection</p>
<p>Recently, cases of suicide have been disclosed frequently. When investigating the reasons, it is said that they are compelled by economic difficulties. Those who are compelled by economic difficulties, unable to save themselves, and thus commit suicide are cowardly self-abandoners. However, reversing the intention to speculate, could they not be considered brave warriors who are willing to die to prompt human introspection? This is not to say that I respect suicide. The path of suicide is indeed not singular. What the ancients called poisoned wine and women, and today's political prisoners in various countries, often use hunger strikes to express their spirit of preferring death to submission. This should not be said to be anything other than a kind of suicide. According to a Reuters report, 200 male workers of a Japanese dyeing and weaving company have been on a hunger strike since Sunday to protest the company's dismissal of a worker. They say that they will not eat until the company reinstates the dismissed worker. Is this hunger strike not equivalent to suicide? Is this kind of suicide not sufficient to prompt human introspection?</p>
<p>Therefore, extending this train of thought to the German murderer Peter Kürten. Peter Kürten has now been sentenced to death. The number of young women, young girls, and men who died at his hands has reached as many as nine people. When asked why he killed people, he said that it was nothing more than an impulse to kill as a form of entertainment and had no other meaning. If humans use murder as an impulse for entertainment and even kill as many as nine people, then the exposure of human cruelty is extreme. No wonder the atmosphere of violence and ferocity pervades the world. This is something that humanity should also reflect on.</p>

<p>Japan Disappointed with Russian Reply</p>
<p>Reuter's, Tokyo, 23rd - The Japan-Russia fisheries dispute has encountered an unexpected setback. The Soviet Union only intends to accept about one-third of the proposals recently put forward by the Japanese authorities. The departure of Japanese fishing boats to Russian waters must now be postponed. Although the Russian reply arrived here last night, the contents have not yet been released by the authorities. The authorities are clearly very disappointed and expect to send instructions to the Japanese ambassador to Russia to negotiate with the Russian authorities again. Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is confident that it can prevent Japanese fishing boats from sailing to Russian waters before the negotiations are concluded, it is feared that the boats may not be willing to sit idly by and suffer losses, miss the fishing season, and take the risk of sailing out.</p>

<p>Consular Jurisdiction Negotiations are in Progress</p>
<p>Efforts to Proceed with the Kailuan Issue</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 22nd - British Foreign Secretary Henderson stated in the House of Commons this afternoon that the current negotiations between China and Britain are about consular jurisdiction. If the negotiations are successful, as he hopes, a treaty can be signed, and before the treaty is signed, the House of Commons will be given an opportunity for debate as usual. Conservative Party member Miller asked whether the future of Shanghai was included in the negotiations. The Foreign Secretary replied that he was paying attention to the matter, but it was not convenient to speak at the moment. Miller said that before negotiating with a government that cannot protect its own people, let alone British people, the House of Commons should know something. The Foreign Secretary replied that this was another matter. A Labor Party member asked if this was another case of secret diplomacy, but the Foreign Secretary did not answer. Conservative Party member Lampson asked whether the current negotiations were based on the report published by the Consular Jurisdiction Committee several years ago. The Foreign Secretary replied that this question should be answered later. The Foreign Secretary also said that news had come from China that the British Ambassador and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang asked about the imminent conclusion of the consular jurisdiction agreement, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs knew nothing about it.

Foreign Secretary Henderson replied that Ambassador Lampson has been in close contact with the Kailuan Management Office and has negotiated with the Chinese authorities.

<p>Appears Gentle but Harboring Treachery</p>
<p>Countless Women Have Suffered</p>
<p>National News, Dosdotofu, 22nd - The murderous demon Peter Goten has been sentenced to death. (The following is from the Telegraph Agency) To date, four young girls, four young women, and one man have died at the hands of this demon, and seven have narrowly escaped. He enticed women to the suburbs with sweet words, then killed them and left with a smile, disappearing without a trace. This was his usual method of killing. Although the police conducted a thorough search, they found no clues, so that for a time the women of the city dared not go out after dusk. He even played tricks, writing to the police and mocking their incompetence. It was not until his sins were full that he was finally arrested last May. The clue to his arrest came from the mother of a murdered girl, Maria, a peasant woman, who received a letter from him, sensed something was wrong, and boldly threw herself into the net, secretly informing the police in advance to set up a tight ambush, so that he could be captured. In summary, his appearance should have been ferocious and terrifying, but it was not. Everyone who knew him usually called him a gentle and honest gentleman. When the case was solved, everyone was shocked. He had been imprisoned for seventeen years for accumulated theft cases. After his release from prison, he was secretive, did not associate with bad people, paid his taxes on time, worked diligently, had a graceful demeanor, and spoke very gently, so that many women were deceived by him. In prison, he still liked to groom himself, and the jailers were also amazed. When interrogated by the police, he confessed that his motive for killing was nothing more than an impulse to kill as a kind of game, and there was no other intention.</p>

As for the Zhu Shaoliang troops on the left wing, after capturing Guangchang, they followed and pursued the Communist bandits, and have reached Baishui and Toupi in Guangchang (east of Ningdu), advancing towards Shicheng. The vanguard is no more than a few dozen miles from Shicheng. The Sun Lianzhong troops, after breaking up the famous bandit nest Zhao Xie in Le'an, advanced towards Dongshaokou in Ningdu, supporting the Sixth Route Army in Guangchang and the Fifth Route Army in Yongfeng. Now, apart from a part of the Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang bandit gangs who are trapped in Donggu, the Lin Biao, Wu Zhonghao, Chen Yi, and Liu Tiechao bandit gangs have withdrawn from southern Jiangxi and gathered in the corner of Ruijin and Shicheng, intending to flee elsewhere. Therefore, Director He issued a report yesterday saying that the Communist bandits are divided and scattered, with Zhu bandits mainly fleeing to Fujian and Peng bandits mainly fleeing to Hunan, and they will disintegrate. This refers to this situation.</p>
<p>Suichuan in western Jiangxi, bordering Guidong in eastern Hunan, is also a bandit's lair. The former county magistrate, Wang Fan, was brutally killed by bandits. In February, the Li Mingrui gang fled from eastern Hunan to Jiangxi and used this as a base. Although Li's bandits fled into Yongxin later, Suichuan was still occupied by scattered bandits. Director He ordered Luo Lin's troops to advance and suppress them. After receiving the order, Luo advanced along the Gan River towards Taihe and Suichuan, forming a mutual support with the Fourth and Nineteenth Route Armies. According to a telegram from Ji'an on the 17th, the Yi brigade of Luo's troops has cleared the red bandits in Shitoushan, Zaoheshi, Majiazhou, and other places in Taihe, and the Xi brigade has also recovered Suichuan County. The remnants of Li Mingrui's rear have completely fled to Yongxin. The scattered bandits in Wugang, Lantian, and Yutian have also been gradually defeated. The traffic between Taihe, Wan'an, Ganzhou, and Ji'an has been completely restored. After receiving the report, the headquarters ordered the Construction Department to quickly repair the power lines from Ji'an to Ganzhou in order to facilitate traffic and benefit military operations.</p>
<p>Director He said that the disaster situation is extremely serious in the areas occupied by the bandits, so in addition to sending telegrams to all parties to ask for disaster relief, he also telegraphed Xu Shiying, chairman of the Central Relief Committee, yesterday, asking him to personally come to the province to inspect and find ways to provide relief. The Local Consolidation Committee is also currently discussing changing the Finance, Construction, and Education Bureaus of each county into sections, concentrating financial resources for the purpose of operating self-defense groups. Active efforts are also being made to reduce and exempt arrears of land tax in bandit areas and to protect tenant farmers in each county in order to provide post-disaster care.</p>
<p>Headquarters news: Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the province yesterday, stipulating the rewards and punishments for captured Red bandits, personnel, weapons, and ammunition. Director He has forwarded it to all troops for compliance. The methods are: (1) 300 yuan for capturing a bandit's field gun; (2) 200 yuan for capturing a mortar; (3) 100 yuan for capturing a machine gun; (4) 50 yuan for capturing a pistol; (5) 10 yuan for capturing a rifle. Those who fail to report captured weapons will be severely punished. (April 21)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Recent News on Bandit Suppression on the Guangdong-Jiangxi Border <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Due to the extensive bandit suppression efforts by various Jiangxi armies near the Guangdong province, there is deep concern that defeated bandits might flee and cause disturbances. Therefore, the Eighth Route Army has specifically ordered the 63rd Division, stationed in the Beijiang area, to move into southern Jiangxi. The 62nd Division, led by Xiang Hanping and stationed in the Dongjiang area, will be deployed to defend the Fujian border. Currently, a regiment of the First Independent Brigade, led by Zhang Ruigui, has already moved into Fengshi and above, and is jointly defending with Zhang Zhen's Fujian army. According to the latest news, the Red Bandits in Jiangxi have been frequently fleeing to eastern Jiangxi, near the border with western Fujian. Moreover, in Liuchexu, Xingning County, Guangdong, a small group of bandits has invaded. The magistrate of Xingning County, fearing the spread of banditry, has urgently telegraphed Commander Xiang in Shantou, requesting him to quickly dispatch five battalions to the county for defense. He has also telegraphed the provincial government to report the situation. Upon receiving the report, the authorities plan to dispatch a unit from Commander Xiang's division to the vicinity to suppress the bandits. As for the Beijiang area, the 19th Route Army continues to station heavy troops in the Xingguo region, as Li Mingrui's forces are currently scattered in eastern Hunan. Strict precautions must be taken to prevent them from linking up with the Red Bandits in eastern Jiangxi. Currently, two brigades of Cai's division have advanced to Longgangxu. Recently, the director of the division's management office, Huang Hechun, and others were specially dispatched back to Guangdong to request military supplies. At the same time, Dai Ji's division has also telegraphed the Guangdong rear affairs office, urging them to quickly recruit and train replacement soldiers to be sent to the front lines. Chen Jitang, considering that Jiang's and Cai's divisions have fought in several provinces and recently suppressed bandits in Jiangxi with great merit, has specially dispatched He Rong, adjutant general of the Eighth Route Army headquarters, to Jiangxi, carrying 100,000 yuan in cash and comfort items such as towels and cigarettes, to reward the officers and soldiers of the two divisions. He Rong, upon receiving the order, departed on the Yuehan train on the 16th to Shaozhou, and will then proceed to Jiangxi. (April 18)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Guangdong Bandits Bomb Three Ships for Several Consecutive Days <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Shiqi and Shiqi Ferry Landings Were Repeatedly Bombed by Bandits</p>
<p>A Ferry in Kaiping Sunk After Hitting a Water Mine, Killing Dozens</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: In Guangdong Province recently, piracy has been rampant and has not subsided. Although naval vessels are said to be patrolling in sections, cases of ship robbery have occurred three times this month. On the evening of the 12th, the Heng'an ferry, which travels between the provincial capital and Shiqi, had a sudden explosion in its passenger cabin shortly after departing from Shiqi. Fortunately, there were not many passengers this time, and no casualties occurred. On the morning of the 13th, at 11:00 AM, the Lianfahe ferry, which travels between Panyu Shiqiao and Shiqi, was about to depart from Shiqi Township when a loud explosion suddenly occurred in the cabin. Fragments of the bomb flew everywhere, immediately injuring three passengers, all of whom were nearby villagers. They were injured in the head, feet, and other areas, and were sent to the municipal hospital for treatment. Both of these ferry bombings were due to prior extortion letters sent by pirates demanding money. The ferry operators ignored them, so they suffered at the hands of the bandits. Only a day or two after these two incidents, the Tongyi Shipping Company in Xihaikou received letters from the Luo Ji Hong bandit gang and the Chen Shiyao bandit gang, demanding 3,000 Hong Kong dollars, several dozen taels of opium, and more than a dozen undershirts, stating that they must be delivered as soon as possible, otherwise, drastic measures would be taken. After receiving the letters, the Tongyi Shipping Company reported to the guild and took strict precautions. Because the bandits' demands were insatiable and impossible to fulfill, and the company had strong capital with eight ferries equipped with guns and cannons for ample self-defense, they did not agree to the bandits' demands that day. The company's largest ferries were the Tongji and Yongfa, which usually travel between Kaiping Taishan and the provincial capital. Security on the ships was extremely tight. The bandits, seeing no way to enter, changed their plans and resorted to external violence, pre-planting water mines in the Shibi waterway in Panyu. The shipowners did not initially notice. On the 17th, when the Tongji and Yongfa ferries were sailing from Kaiping Taishan to the provincial capital, the Tongji ferry went first, followed by the Yongfa ferry. Each ferry carried over a hundred passengers and a large amount of cargo. At 11:20 AM that morning, as they were passing through the Shibi River, where the waterway was narrow, the ships sailed along the center line. Unexpectedly, as it approached just dozens of feet away from the Shibi pier, the Tongji ferry unfortunately struck a water mine, and was immediately bombed. The sound lasted for over a minute. The water sprayed up about ten feet high, and the entire ship shook. The bottom of the Enping (cabin name) cabin was blown open by a large hole, about a foot wide. River water poured in, and the ship began to sink. The cries of the people on board shook the heavens, calling for help. The Xinnanshan tugboat pulling the ferry immediately cut the cable and turned back to rescue. At the same time, the Yongfa ferry, which was sailing behind, also approached to assist. Fortunately, the river was not deep at that location, making rescue easier. As a result, about eighty passengers and crew members from the Tongji ferry were rescued. The remaining forty or fifty people sank into the water with the ship and all drowned. That afternoon, the Xinnanshan and Yongfa ferries transported the rescued people back to the provincial capital. Among them, a crew member named Cen was injured in the explosion and immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. On the 18th, the Fangbian Hospital dispatched over a dozen undertakers with dozens of coffins to the scene of the accident to retrieve the bodies. By the afternoon, over a dozen bodies had been recovered. Many more corpses have not yet surfaced. Afterwards, the Fourth Fleet of the Navy, believing that the Yingjie patrol ship stationed in that section had not provided adequate protection, reprimanded the ship's captain and dispatched the Zhujiang ship to assist in the patrol.

<h3 id="e79">Suggestions from the Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Relocate Surrendered Red Bandits from Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi</p>
<p>Request the Government to Issue 100 Million in Public Bonds</p>
<p>To Handle the Relocation Costs to the Northwest</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: The Red Bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces are numerous and cause great harm. The central government has separately dispatched troops to conduct a large-scale encirclement and suppression. The period of elimination is expected to be not far off. The primary criminals are unforgivable, but those who blindly follow coercion are not without pity. It seems that they should be allowed to surrender and given a path to self-renewal. However, these people have been intoxicated by the Red Bandits for a long time and are deeply poisoned. Moreover, their previous actions were mostly by hooligans and gangsters who had no permanent property and no legitimate occupations. They should be resettled in a way that they can be reformed. The Hunan Provincial Steering Committee recently received a request from the Changsha City Steering Committee and forwarded it to the central government, requesting the issuance of 100 million yuan in public bonds to cover the cost of relocating surrendered Red Bandits from Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces to the Northwest. This would improve their environment and give them a prosperous life, while also sending personnel to instill the Three Principles of the People in them, so that they can be subtly influenced. The presented document is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"According to the Changsha City Party Affairs Consolidation Committee's report, the 42nd Committee meeting of the Committee, presented by Committee Member Luo Juju, (Main Text) Request the superiors to forward the central government the case of issuing reclamation public bonds to relocate surrendered Red Bandits from Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces to the Northwest, (Reasons) Investigate the rampant banditry and the chaos everywhere. Now that the army is encircling and suppressing them, the period of annihilation must not be far off. Our central government has a broad mind, using both kindness and authority, allowing those who blindly follow coercion a chance to reform. Reddened masses compete to extricate themselves, so that wherever the flag points, they will collapse at the wind. The amnesty decree is promulgated, and they come back together. This is truly the luck of the party and the country, and the happiness of the people. However, considering that the people, who are good and bad, can they be truly good in nature? Their loss of identity as bandits is due to the seduction of heresy. To be in a difficult situation with one's livelihood, the reason for risking one's life is mostly that of the poor. It is good that our country's economy is backward and its industry is in decline, coupled with frequent natural and man-made disasters, unemployment is increasing day by day, and it is difficult to make a living. The Red Bandits take advantage of this opportunity and falsely advocate the slogan of seeking happiness for the proletariat, or even give small favors to widely seduce the people with naive knowledge and hunger. The poor are easily seduced into banditry and rebellion. For the present plan, on the negative side, efforts should be made to eliminate bandit disasters, and on the positive side, it is especially important to enrich their lives and reform the people's hearts. The ancients said that with enough food and clothing, etiquette and righteousness will flourish. Also, it is said that in prosperous years, children are more reliable, and in bad years, children are more violent. Judging from the present, is that not true? However, the strategy to relieve unemployment is diverse, but immigration and reclamation have the most significant and easy to implement results. The Northwest provinces of our country are vast, the land is fertile, and the climate is mild. All the treasures and forests are undeveloped. Immigrating and reclaiming them is the source of a rich country. The three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi have long been trampled by Red Bandits, and the local vitality is almost exhausted. Even if the entire area is cleared, the aftermath will not be easy. Moreover, the surrendered people have been deeply poisoned and it is difficult to expect them to reform and never take the wrong path again. If they can be relocated to the Northwest, improve their environment, and give them a prosperous life, then boiling water can be prevented by removing the firewood from under the cauldron. It will be easy to do once and for all. Also, the people who are bandits are mostly hooligans and gangsters who have no permanent property and no occupation. Even if they extricate themselves and return, they must set up factories to accommodate them, or lend them money to cultivate the land, so that they can maintain their lives and not be deceived by the Red Bandits. If this fee is used for reclamation, the bandits and the Red Bandits will be cut off forever. Move them to the Northwest, and send personnel from the Party Department to train and instill the Three Principles of the People. They can be subtly influenced. Although the government's expenses are the same, the results are great. Nothing is more important than achieving two goals at once. Therefore, special measures are proposed for selection. Should it be appropriate? Ask the public to decide, (Measures) (1) The central government shall organize the Northwest Reclamation Committee to preside over everything. The number of its members shall be determined by the central government, but at least two shall be assigned from each of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. (2) The transfer shall be divided into two phases. The first phase will be strong men, and the second phase will be the old, young, women, and children. However, the first phase must select more workers so that they can build houses first and have a place to live, and then gradually implement reclamation. (3) The reclamation public bond is tentatively set at 100 million yuan. The three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi will be equally divided, with an average of 100,000 Red Bandits in each province, totaling 300,000 people. The average cost per person for agricultural tools, seeds, plowing cattle, and construction is estimated at 100 yuan, totaling 90 million yuan. Schools will be set up for training, hospitals will be opened, and other temporary expenses will be set at 10 million yuan, totaling 100 million yuan. (4) The central government shall issue an order to the National Government's Ministry of Finance to issue the above reclamation public bond in installments. (5) The central government shall issue a notice to the governments of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and the military leaders of the bandit suppression, that the surrendered Red Bandits must be sent to the Northwest for reclamation. Each province shall issue passports nearby, and when a certain number of people are gathered, personnel shall be sent to escort them at one time. (6) Those who surrender and are able to live independently in the local area, and who are certified by the local person in charge, are not limited to this. (7) This case shall be decided by this meeting, and submitted to the higher authorities for review and implementation by the central government. It has been discussed by the affiliated association, and it is agreed that relocating the surrendered Red Bandits to the Northwest can solve their lives and develop national treasures. The proposal of Member Luo is an urgent matter. The records are in the file. I hereby submit the case for inspection and instruction. Respectfully submitted, and after being submitted to the 120th Standing Committee of the Association for discussion, it was decided to forward it to the central government for adoption and implementation, and to telegraph the two provinces of Hubei and Jiangxi, requesting them to advocate unanimously. The records are in the file. I hereby submit the case for review and implementation. (Twenty-first)</p>
<h3 id="e80">The Seventh Division Defeats Xiao Su's Bandit Gang <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: There have always been bandits lurking in the area between Xiao and Su in southern Xuzhou. Recently, Wang Jun dispatched Gong Chaomei's unit of the 39th Regiment of the Seventh Division to join forces with Zhang Lisheng's unit of the Second Cavalry Division to clear the bandit gangs in Suxian County, northern Anhui. After that, Gong's unit moved westward to suppress Zhang Chuanwen, Zhou Dezhen, Zhou Laohai, Yu Deming, Wang Kunlun and other bandits in the area of Cailihou, Huashangaozhuang. Qian Guobing, the first battalion commander, led his troops to engage in a fierce battle with more than 300 bandits in the Hushan area. The bandits resisted with the help of the terrain. After two hours of fighting, they collapsed and fled into the deep mountains. In this battle, the bandit leader Zhou Laohai and dozens of bandits were killed. Battalion Commander Qian still dispatched Xia, an attached officer, to lead the first and second companies to cooperate with the county police force to pursue the bandits in the Naogiu area. Qian himself led the remaining troops to pursue the bandits in the Lutuan area, and urged local militias to build enclosures and self-defense. The bandits in Xiao and Su have been largely pacified. Wang Jun immediately reported the situation to the headquarters, and yesterday he received an telegram from the headquarters to commend him. (April 21)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture Revises Cocoon Trading Regulations <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines Changed Its Policy of Restricting Cocoon Trading in Order to Encourage</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The Installation of New-Style Cocoon Drying Machines and the Promotion of Cocoon Drying Cooperatives. The First Meeting of the Provincial Sericulture Design Committee Resolved That Article 4 of the Jiangsu Province Provisional Cocoon Trading Regulations, Which Stipulated That "Counties Where the Amount of Cocoon Drying Exceeds the Amount of Cocoon Production, Any Additional Applications to Establish New Cocoon Trading Businesses, in Addition to Paying 20 Yuan Per Stove, Will Be Subject to an Additional 50 Yuan Surtax," This Measure is Close to Oppressive and Does Not Provide Any Remedy in Fact and Should Be Changed to "Counties Where the Amount of Cocoon Drying Exceeds the Amount of Cocoon Production, No Cocoon Trading Business Without New-Style Cocoon Drying Machine Equipment May Apply to Establish a Business," Also, Because Article 8 of the Original Regulations Stipulated That Farmers' Cocoon Drying Technology Was Immature and Easily Damaged the Quality of the Cocoons, It Was Resolved to Abolish the Farmers' Own Cocoon Stoves and Actively Promote Cocoon Drying Cooperatives. In addition, Article 10 of the Original Regulations on the Scope of Penalties Did Not Stipulate Anything for Cocoon Trading Businesses Holding Cocoon Licenses Arbitrarily Relocating Their Addresses or Transferring Ownership, Which Often Caused Disputes and Made Supervision Inconvenient. It is Also Appropriate to Take Measures to Ban It. The Bureau Has Separately Revised Them and Submitted Them to the Provincial Government Committee Meeting on the 10th of This Month for Approval and Ordered All Counties to Comply. The Revised Regulations Are Recorded Below:</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province Provisional Cocoon Trading Regulations (Article 1) All Counties in Jiangsu Province May Establish Cocoon Trading Businesses.

(Article 4) In Counties Where the Amount of Cocoon Drying Exceeds the Amount of Cocoon Production in Paragraph 1 of the Previous Article, No Cocoon Trading Business Without New-Style Cocoon Drying Machine Equipment May Apply to Establish a Business. If It Is Found That the Applicant Has Lost Their Citizenship Qualifications in Paragraph 2, the Issuance of a Cocoon License May Be Suspended. (Article 5) Any Application That Has Been Reviewed by the Department of Agriculture and Mines and Is in Accordance With the Two Items Mentioned Above May Be Sent to the Education Funding Management Office of the Department of Finance for Approval and the Issuance of a Cocoon License to Begin Business.

(Article 11) These Regulations Will Be Implemented From the Date of Promulgation.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Thriving Strategies for the Jiangsu Provincial Capital's Business District <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Proposals to Dredge Duck Pond River and the East and West Intercalary Rivers</p>
<p>Remedies Are Possible for the Old Marketplace Before the New Marketplace is Complete</p>
<p>Section 2 of Zhongzheng Road Decided to Use Route A</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The Jiangsu Construction Department convened a meeting of the Provincial Capital Construction Advisory Council at 2:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Hou Zhenping, Lin Wenqin, Su Zengyi, Qiu Yu, Zhang Jianming, Lu Xiaobo, Bao Mingshu, Hu Jianchun, Leng Yuqiu, Zhang Yisun, Yu Xiaochuan, Chen Fu, and Ye Jiajun. Ye Jiajun chaired the meeting. This was the first Advisory Council meeting since the reorganization of the Construction Committee. The Engineering Department proposed the route problem for Section 2 of Zhongzheng Road, dividing it into two routes, A and B. It was decided to use Route A. The reason being that there is no need for a road to be perfectly straight. The houses demolished by Route B would all be demolished through the center of people's houses, causing great losses to the people. According to the proposal's description, Route A has more advantages than Route B. Later, Advisors Leng, Lu, Hu, Yu, Bao, Zhang, Hou, and Lin successively stated their opinions on the question of how to remedy the shallowing of the Jiangtan in the old business district of the provincial capital. They also invited Mao Yisheng, Director of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, to attend the discussion, believing that it was necessary to dredge the Intercalary River. It is noted that the Provincial Government has resolved to open Xiangshan Port as a new marketplace on a grand scale, which is welcomed by public opinion in the provincial capital. However, the reason why the Provincial Government abandoned the old marketplace is that the Jiangtan rises day by day and will become wasteland. Therefore, it abandons the old and seeks the new, using it as a fundamental solution. However, the rise of the Jiangtan is due to the changing river flow, with the northern torrent being faster than the southern gradual flow. If the river flow is not changed, and only the marketplace is moved eastward, there is a risk that Xiangshan Port will also be shallow in the long run. (On the south bank of Jiaoshan, the water flow was originally more rapid than on the north side of Jiaoshan and unfathomable, but in recent years the north side of Jiaoshan has become more rapid than the south side of the river, and shoals have been found at the foot of Xiangshan). This is one of the reasons. Xiangshan Port is an open space, and the roads and various buildings will naturally cost less, but it is impossible for the industries and businesses of Zhenjiang, which were originally in the western district, to completely move to the new marketplace. As a result, the old marketplace may not be able to revive, and the new marketplace may not be able to complete, and the prosperity of the provincial capital will remain only an ideal. This is the second reason. The cost of operating the new marketplace, according to the budget for the use of construction public bonds, is more than 1.63 million yuan, but the Provincial Government previously had a resolution to open a pilot high-area construction zone in the city. The drawing plan and land registration have been underway for some time, and the cost is only a part of the 700,000 yuan in construction funds for the provincial capital, but it has been suspended to this day due to lack of funds. Then, the 1.6 million yuan plan for the new port is even more difficult to implement. If we do not start by maintaining the old marketplace first, the establishment of the new marketplace will be a distant prospect. The old one has been abandoned, and the new one has not been completed. Zhenjiang's industry and commerce will be retired. This is the third reason. It is noted that the construction public bonds list 300,000 yuan for the reorganization of port affairs, which is not a small amount, but compared with 1.6 million yuan, it is not much. Dredging the Intercalary River is a stopgap measure, and opening Xiangshan Port is a fundamental cure. Before Xiangshan Port is completed, the Intercalary River must be dredged first to maintain the old marketplace, so as to wait for the completion of the new marketplace. There will be no shortage in between. This is the fourth reason. Director Mao Yisheng also explained the reasons for opening the new port: (1) Xiangshan Port can be guaranteed not to be shallow for 60 years, (2) It is difficult to guarantee that the Intercalary River will not be shallow again in the future, (3) Changing the river flow is a huge project. Not only is there construction in Guazhoutou in Jiangbei, but also major projects in Runzhou, which costs too much, and so on. After a long discussion, the meeting suggested that the Construction Department provide the Provincial Government with reference, and the proposal was titled "Proposal to Dredge Duck Pond River and the East and West Intercalary Rivers to Prosper the Provincial Capital's Commerce." The meeting adjourned at about 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Russian Province of Amu Darya Expels Chinese Farmers <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Implementing Policy to Suppress Small Farmers</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jilin states that the Amu Darya province is the granary of the Russian Far East, particularly the area along the Jingqi and Heilongjiang (Amur) river basins, known for its fertile lands. On the left bank of the river is the Tangbo Fu Ke district, its southeast side being the Sixty-Four Villages East of the River seized by Russia. During the Boxer Rebellion, hundreds of our farmers were driven into the turbulent river by the Russian governor-general Gribsky, perishing at the hands of foreigners in this very land. For thirty years, our countrymen have seemingly forgotten this tragedy, and those who have tilled this land with their plows have once again gathered like ants. Moreover, after the establishment of the Soviet government, all land was nationalized, and to prevent it from lying barren, they loudly proclaimed slogans such as abolishing national boundaries and the sanctity of labor and agriculture, vigorously attracting settlers. The Russian government even allocated seeds and banks provided capital assistance. Of the agricultural harvest, the state takes six parts, and the tenants receive four. As a result, even more families came. Recently, the government, seeing that the communist policies are gradually taking effect, and that the wealthy and large farmer classes have been completely crushed, no longer fearing their rebellion, has now taken a further step to suppress small farmers. Those private farmers in that country who have not joined agricultural cooperatives are often having their assets confiscated, forced to gather firewood in the mountains or driven to the remote frontiers to develop the borderlands. Taking the Tangbo Fu Ke district as an example, nearly all farmers in that country who have not joined agricultural cooperatives have now been expelled. There are about forty Chinese tenant households scattered in this area who have not acquired Russian citizenship, but because they are still under the protection of the consulate, they cannot be arbitrarily handled like the citizens of that country. Therefore, the authorities have first declared that all their land will be reclaimed, and their cattle and horses will be impounded, awaiting further orders. The intention is to force them to join the cooperatives. If they join as members, they must hand over all their cattle, horses, and farm implements to be used as shares in the cooperative. The annual interest and surplus are recorded in a small booklet, nominally distributed as extra profits, but in reality, they cannot be freely used. As for daily necessities, the restrictions are even stricter. Apart from a fixed amount of flour, salt, and other items, almost nothing else can be obtained. Therefore, these overseas Chinese farmers are currently in a very difficult situation. Joining the cooperative would mean sinking even deeper, but not joining means they cannot survive. They are truly trapped in a helpless situation. In short, wherever Soviet law reaches, whether for its own citizens or foreigners, it aims to ensure that, beyond barely providing enough to eat and wear, no one possesses significant property. If they do, it will be confiscated according to law. If the law is insufficient, new clauses will be created to supplement it. This is the case for private merchants, and it is the same for farmers and workers. As for the protective power of the consulate, it only extends to the scope of the law. For example, the land rented in the Tangbo Fu Ke district has no fixed term, nor is there a contract. The government reserves the right to reclaim it at any time. The consulate can only request that the movable property of these tenant farmers be allowed to be freely sold and returned to their home country, but even this is very difficult.</p>

<p>Transfer of Prison Warden. Prison Warden Zhang Zonglie has been transferred to the position of Prison Warden and Head of the Detention Center in Jiangyin County by order of the High Court. Xu Qi will succeed Zhang. The handover was completed today (the 23rd). It is said that Mr. Zhang will rest for a while before going to Cheng to take up his new post.</p>
<p>Female Corpse Found in Xiuye Bridge River. Today, the body of a woman was found in the Xiuye Bridge River. The local bailiff reported it to the court prosecutor, who went to examine it in the afternoon. The body has been identified by family member Zhang Jinqi as his daughter, who had been missing for several days. She was seventeen years old and had been betrothed to someone. The matter arose because Wu Jingqing, the owner of a cigarette shop in the Hualou section of the Yue Temple, had two hundred small coins stolen on the 17th. Since his niece (Zhang's daughter) had come to the shop that day, she was suspected. He asked someone to invite her back for questioning. The girl even undressed to show her innocence. Her father, upon learning of this, scolded her. She went missing the next day. Zhang Jinqi went to Wu Jingqing to demand that she be found. They argued, and the Public Security Bureau was informed, who fined Zhang three yuan for damaging items in the shop. He was extremely angry and filed a lawsuit with the County Court for investigation. Unexpectedly, his daughter had already committed suicide by drowning herself. It is unknown how this tragic case will be resolved.</p>

<p>Complex Incest Case. The incest case involving a brother and sister, who are suspected of helping the brother kill his sister-in-law, which has shocked the city, has drawn great attention from the public and the Public Security Bureau. After the First Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau reported the details of the case to the General Bureau, the judicial section twice summoned Jiang Youmei, the deceased's husband, but he did not appear. He was then ordered to be brought in on bail. He was apprehended by the guarantor and the police at the Xiannv Temple and brought to the bureau. Tang, the head of the judicial section, conducted a preliminary interrogation, during which Jiang said that his wife had indeed died of illness. Because the neighbors often borrowed money from him without success, they fabricated this shocking rumor after his wife's death. He also said that the person living with him was his sister-in-law, not his biological sister. Since the case involved judicial matters, Chief Tang attached the original documents and sent them to the court's prosecutor's office for detailed investigation. However, it is said that the case involves many suspected impostors and extortionists, and has attracted the attention of Pacification Commissioner Zhang, who has arrested a person named Ge and handed him over to the military law office for detailed interrogation. The matter is expanding and may not be resolved in the short term.</p>

<p>Having recently read the news item “U.S. Church Fundraising Scandal” in the Overseas News section of your paper on April 20, I must state that the details mentioned do not conform to the facts and may easily cause readers to misunderstand. The missionary work of Christianity in various countries is extensive, and the work is also diverse. Constant improvement is, of course, a necessary plan. Therefore, a group of enthusiastic church members in the United States who are dedicated to overseas missionary work elected representatives to come to various Eastern countries (such as China, Japan, India, etc.) to re-examine the overseas missionary work. Our delegation has now arrived in China and is diligently engaged in investigations. We will report to our country this year. Afterwards, other American church groups will come to China based on our investigation report to assess the value of the work to promote improvements. The purpose is to promote the development of the church and the efficiency of the work. There is no “arbitrary and wasteful spending of donations and failure to use them for proper purposes” as reported in yesterday's newspaper. I fear that misinformation will spread and cause misunderstandings. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction. Respectfully, Douglas Paul, Chairman of the U.S. Church Overseas Missionary Work Investigation Delegation, April 23.</p>

<p>Commendation for Guangdong Education Department's Reorganization of Private Schools</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, upon receiving a report from the Guangdong Education Department on the progress of banning unregistered and poorly run private middle schools, instructed the department: "Having received your report, the people of your province should respond to the needs of the times and actively establish middle schools to supplement the inadequacies of public schools, which is a good phenomenon in education. The department's ability to distinguish between good and bad and actively provide guidance is commendable. However, the educational goals and implementation guidelines of the Republic of China clearly state that ordinary education must cultivate national morality and foster life skills and enhance productive capacity. The instructions are very detailed. In the future, if people in your province are interested in establishing middle schools, they should be instructed to focus on vocational education. Then, elementary school graduates will not only be spared the plight of having nowhere to study but will also be able to support themselves and serve society after leaving school. This is much more beneficial than focusing solely on ordinary middle schools. The department should pay attention to this when reviewing applications from private individuals to establish middle schools."</p>

<h3 id="e119">Detailed Record of the Election of National Assembly Representatives from the Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>—Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The election of representatives to the National Assembly has concluded in Shanghai. From the business sector, Wang Yansong, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, was elected. The general situation has been reported in various newspapers. This undertaking was highly valued by the late Premier, and was solemnly stated in his will. Therefore, Choucheng also went to participate on that day. This record of what was seen, it is assumed, will also be welcomed by those who care about national affairs.</p>
<p>On that day, the national flag was hung high above the entrance of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Patrol officers dispatched by the Public Security Bureau, along with the chamber's security team, stood fully armed on both sides. The hall was in the assembly hall on the second floor. A registration desk was set up at the entrance, staffed by Zheng Chengqing, Sun Mingqi, Jin Shengbai, and Xue Guangqian as managers. After the representatives of various industries signed their names and the names of their respective guilds, they were given a strip of white cloth, serving as the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce National Assembly Representative Election Number X Entry Permit. Only then could they enter the venue to vote. Three rows of representative seats were set up inside the venue, each row with three lines, and each line with nine seats. Pens, ink, and water dishes were provided for filling out the ballots. Wang Xiaolai, wearing a red satin badge of the "Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Election Supervisor," sat to the left of the ballot box. It is said that he arrived at the meeting at 7:30 AM. It was stipulated today that the ballots would be counted at 4:00 PM, requiring him to work for ten hours straight, unable to leave his post. Even meals had to be brought to the ballot box. Since leaving his study, he had never sat so still. Out of necessity, he brought various tabloids and the Thirteen Classics Compilation published by the Commercial Press to pass the time. He also said that the chamber of commerce electoral roll had a total of three hundred and ninety-three voters. The license plate number of his car was also three hundred and ninety-three. What a coincidence! However, he had declared that he would exercise his right to vote in Sheng County. Therefore, although he was an election supervisor in today's election, he had neither the right to vote nor the right to be elected. Voting manager Ding Shoutang wore a yellow badge, and ballot counting manager Shao Baosan wore a blue badge. They both sat on the right side of the stage. When representatives from various industries came to collect ballots, Mr. Ding checked their names against the electoral roll and asked them to sign the voting register in person before handing over the ballot. The ballot paper was white with blue lettering, about four inches long and two inches wide, resembling a Western-style envelope. Inside was a rectangular shape marked with a thin line. Above was the phrase "Nominee," with a space in the middle and the word "Name" beside it, to be filled with the nominee's name. Below was the word "Voter," and the voter was required to fill in their own name. Otherwise, the ballot would be considered invalid. The ballot and the sealing flap were stamped with the seals of the election supervisor, both large and small. Supervisor Mayor Zhang wanted to inspect various universities and freelance groups also holding elections at the same time. Therefore, he arrived at the meeting at 8:30 AM, took a brief look, sat for a short time, and then left. On that day, cars and chartered vehicles came and went like shuttles within the Chamber of Commerce. Zheng Chengqing was the first representative to sign in, earning the number one spot. Pei Yunqing and Fang Jiaobo signed in at the same time, one as number sixty-three and the other as number sixty-four. Pei jokingly said to Fang, "You and I can be considered brothers." Wang Yansong received a total of one hundred and seventy votes. However, one of the ballots had added a wood radical to the "Yan" character in his name, rendering it invalid. Therefore, the newspapers announced that he had won with one hundred and sixty-nine votes.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Record of a Visit to the Jiangwan Branch of Xiaoguan Garden <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Qionghan</p>
<p>I have visited the main garden of Xiaoguan Garden many times. However, the Jiangwan branch is slightly remote. Since its opening in the autumn, I had only stopped there once during the chrysanthemum exhibition. Nearly half a year has passed without me having the time to set foot there again. A few days ago, the garden owner, Mr. Yang Shouchun, informed me that the peach and plum blossoms in the garden were in full bloom, and the cyclamens were vying for beauty, making it worth a visit. He specially arranged a banquet in the garden on Sunday and invited Wu Zilianzhou, Shao Yiqun, Tian Jihen, and myself for a day's excursion. Previously, Mr. Qian Junchuan had suggested gathering for breakfast at Wufangzhai, setting a time limit from 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM. I found the conditions too strict and discussed with Yiqun not participating, choosing to go our separate way. We did not reach our destination until near noon. Although the weather was not sunny that day, fortunately the overnight rain had cleared, which was enough to inspire us. The scenery along the way was particularly charming. As we approached the garden gate, we caught sight of an eagle soaring in the sky, as if touching the clouds. Yiqun and I were deeply amazed. Upon entering the garden, we learned that it was the painter Mr. Zhang Guangyu who was playing the trick of the wind calligrapher there. After a short delay, Lianzhou came out from inside, and upon seeing us, exclaimed with joy, "The eaters have arrived!" After a short pause, I toured the flowerbeds. I indeed saw the radiant and blooming cyclamens, as splendid as brocade. The flowerbeds were all newly planted with famous chrysanthemum seedlings. In one place, it was like curtains hanging low, with dwellings visible from afar. Each cluster was planted with peonies taller than my shoulder, laden with buds. Although there were already some that had broken their calyxes, the flowers were only half-open. Although it is said that the spring is still cold and the flower season is somewhat delayed, these beautiful and famous flowers, resembling a seventeen or eighteen-year-old bride, were entirely veiled in light chiffon, creating an enchanting posture that far surpasses those who lightly reveal their beauty. I heard from Shouchun that these two clusters of peonies have been around for decades, and are not easily found today. They were originally in the garden of a certain wealthy family. Due to the reconstruction of their house, there was no space to accommodate them. The cost of these two branches was almost the entire property of an average person. If one wanted to find something similar, it would not be easy to obtain even at twice the price. During the banquet that day, Mr. Tian Jihen's enthusiasm for wine was particularly strong. He even raised his glass repeatedly with Mr. Wang Yongkang and Mr. Qian Junchuan, who were sitting across the table, causing surprise. Some said that Mr. Tian had newly taken a concubine and was deliberately in high spirits, unapproachable. It seems that he plans to hold a banquet in the garden next Sunday, not only because he loves the location being isolated from the hustle and bustle, but also because he has thoroughly read the line "hiding the beauty from his wife" in the Story of the Western Wing. That evening, I stayed late due to playing mahjong in the garden. Mr. Yang kindly offered to drive me home. Before leaving, he also gifted me with many pots of exotic flowers. Thus, I returned with blooming flowers. Therefore, this journey is particularly worthy of recording.</p>
<h3 id="e122">More Than Ten Days Since the Ye Chen Case Trial Began <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Wenxiu</p>
<p>Several years ago, there were the "Three Little Ones" in Shanghai, who were quite famous in society. Among them, "Little Rascal" Ye Zhongfang was the most well-known. Recently, the "Three Little Ones" have rarely been seen, each pursuing their own future endeavors. Unexpectedly, "Little Rascal" Ye Zhongfang has ended up in court due to his love for Chen Xiuzhen (also known as Shirley), a dance hall girl. Here is a record of what I saw at yesterday's trial, in addition to what has already been reported by various newspapers.</p>
<p>Zhao Guangzu Attends the Hearing　Zhao Guangzu, who was once romantically involved with a prostitute named Mei Fei and faced divorce proceedings initiated by his wife, Tan Meiying, but eventually reconciled with his wife, attended the court hearing as a close friend of Ye. Afterwards, Zhao remarked to others, "Today's dance girls only love money and have no affection." Perhaps this was a statement based on his own experiences.</p>
<p>All Court Staff Attended　It happened that there were not many cases at the court on that day. Since many people admired Ye's reputation, they all came to observe the hearing. The spectacle was no less grand than the Xue Die contract termination case.</p>
<p>Sedative Pills Ineffective　Since the lawsuit involving Chen and Ye arose, Ye has been quite frustrated and reluctant to have a public trial, which would hurt his feelings. Consequently, he changed his name and went into hiding at the Beiping Military Academy. Later, upon reading about the facts of the case in the newspaper and receiving an urgent telegram from his lawyer, Jiang Yiping, he rushed back before the trial. However, Ye still did not want to see Chen and planned to end his life. Twenty minutes before the trial, he swallowed ten Atalin sedative pills, hoping to die on the spot in court. Unexpectedly, the pills not only had no effect, but instead invigorated him, allowing him to say everything he wanted to say. Afterwards, Ye told people that it was because his ancestors were watching over him and secretly protecting him.</p>
<p>Fifteen Yuan Forever Etched in His Heart　On the night Ye and Chen engaged in a physical relationship, Ye only had fifteen yuan left in his pocket. After spending it, his pocket was empty. However, Chen not only did not demand more money from him, but also provided him with tea, meals, and other things. He was deeply moved and believed that she was the only true lover in the world. Thus, he had the idea of living together with her, forming an unbreakable bond.</p>
<p>Deep Affection　After the court hearing, Jiang Yiping advised Ye, saying that based on the current situation, he should wake up to reality. However, Ye replied, "I will always love her. Even if she wants to leave me and go elsewhere, I will never stop her. I only hope that she cherishes her future and does not marry the wrong person. Then, even if I wander in a foreign land, I will die with peace of mind."</p>
<p>Singing and Dancing Madly Before Death　Before the trial, Ye, having resolved to die, opened bottles of champagne at the Black Cat dance hall the night before, reveling in extreme pleasure for one last time. It is said that he spent two or three hundred yuan in one night, which shows how heartbroken he was, not caring about money at all.</p>
<p>The Tinder of the Lawsuit　Chen received favorable treatment after entering Ye's residence. Even the first wife addressed her as "sister," and Ye's mother called her "Miss." One day, when the cook served a meal, Chen complained about the taste and suggested to Ye that he dismiss the cook. Ye's mother said, "The world is changing for the worse. A new cook is not as good as an experienced one." Chen thought this meant they valued the cook more than her, so she angrily left and never returned, eventually leading to the lawsuit. The cook can be said to have been the tinder that ignited the conflict.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the 18th, following instructions from Professor Ma Shida, I started using body oil. This oil seems to be ordinary oil, the kind that can be bought at various snack shops, mixed with a type of medicine. This medicine is called Camphor in English and Gobao in the local Hindi dialect. It's the same as Chinese camphor. Adding peppercorns allows it to be stored in cookies. Camphor oil can be applied to various parts of the body to remove dampness and treat all kinds of skin diseases. This is because the area is very humid and hot. Even in winter, the nights are slightly chilly, so blankets are needed, but during the day, only light clothing is worn. If you don't take a cool bath for several days, your body will itch. Even now, in winter, I still have heat rash. I've used various expensive medicines, but they haven't been able to eliminate it. It itches every afternoon. Mrs. Lu, the consul's wife, said that when they arrived during the hot season, they had heat rash, and using this medicine was very effective in clearing it up and providing a cooling sensation. Anyone traveling to India should pay attention to this matter, as it's quite important. It can also ward off foul odors. Chinese camphor comes from Jiangxi and Fujian. Years ago, when I was traveling north from Shaoguan, I saw many camphor trees along the road. A friend from Jiangxi told me that this tree can be boiled to produce camphor, which is extremely profitable. The method is simple. Use a machine to produce it. A capital of over 100,000 is enough. Currently, the Japanese dominate this industry. Camphor trees grow in near-tropical regions, and people who come to hot regions also need to use it. I've only recently begun to understand the strangeness of life in India and realized the need for what the Lotus Sutra says: "Apply oil to your feet." It's essential here to apply oil to your body and feet. Indians have various ways of applying it, with different colors and medicines. They might apply it to their foreheads in various shapes and walk around openly. Over time, this has become a religious custom. The way Burmese women apply makeup to their faces is similar. It's a necessity for living in tropical regions.</p>
<p>On the 20th, Master Daokai and I visited the Asiatic Society on Park Road. A Tibetan man led the tour. Since the Lunar New Year was approaching and there were few people working, there were few visitors. The nature of this society is that it is a public organization for the study of Asian cultures, but in reality, it has become economically controlled by the British government. The director is Dutch. He serves as the secretary. Below him, each country has a representative. They collect documents, pictures, and artifacts from various countries for research. Ancient and modern texts are classified and arranged. The bookshelves are all made of iron, not wooden boxes. Tropical climates require good ventilation. The layout is generally like this. I glanced through it briefly and saw that they had Chinese classics, Taoist scriptures, and Buddhist texts. The Tibetan man showed me mostly about the Tibetan section. The Tibetan man was named Jumyang. He was bald and wore a purple mandarin jacket and robe. Master Dao said that this was the clothing of Buddhist monks. He showed me Tibetan alphabets and phonology. When I read them, they were exactly the same as the four-character rhymes in Chinese. I realized that the study of phonetics and pronunciation with fanqie (a method of indicating the pronunciation of a Chinese character by using two other characters) came to China from India. The Japanese monk Kukai created the Iroha alphabet, also modeled after Indian writing. Tibetan writing is the same. The Mongols also imitated Tibetan writing. Mongols who want to become famous monks must send people to study in Tibet. So, in the realm of sound, India is the great master of Asia. Professor Ma Shida once told me that ancient Indian culture owes much to the power of Krishna. In the Indian language, Krishna is the same word that Jews use for Jesus, Christ. It's the same word, with different long and short sounds. I don't know if they have the same origin.</p>
<p>Reading various English survey reports on Tibet, I sighed at the British audacity in plotting for Tibet. It's not accidental. They have specialists surveying the entire and partial divisions of Tibet. There's a large English-Tibetan dictionary worth 32 rupees. There are thick reports from 1922, 1923, and 1924, published in London, with various illustrations. They record the ethnic customs, products, and everything else in detail, leaving nothing out. We know nothing about this. Even our famous scholars and great politicians know nothing about it. What do we rely on to compete with others? I remember someone once commenting that the Chinese understanding of themselves is far inferior to the foreigners' understanding of us. These are truly heartbreaking words. However, there is a reason for this. The Chinese ignorance of long-term strategies is due to two reasons: one, because we don't know ourselves domestically, let alone know the outside world; two, because the people of a monarchy for thousands of years have no habit of uniting, and there are few independent initiatives in society, lacking the ability to organize and manage society; and three, there is no government assistance or subsidies. It has been 20 years since the revolution. The amount of money spent on wars by the various provincial governments is immeasurable. Has any of it been used to reward academic research and inventions? Alas, there is no talent or common sense in the provincial governments.</p>

<p>Gold Market Turns Downward</p>
<p>Plummeting Over Ten Taels　Yesterday, the 23rd, the gold market once again trended downwards, with rapid fluctuations. The overall movement was not insignificant. A total of fourteen taels were traded throughout the day, ultimately dropping by more than ten taels. This was a reaction after successive increases. The volume of trading in the market was not as high as the previous day, with sellers generally dominating. The situation was the opposite of the previous day, likely due to a slight decrease in foreign exchange rates, causing the domestic market to weaken. The peers' intentions were generally peaceful, and they were not moved by reports of falling prices in overseas silver markets, as European buyers remained strong. Therefore, the gold price dropped early in the morning, running counter to expectations. Later, buyers became aggressive, briefly pushing past the 740 tael mark. However, due to the active selling by Guangdong merchants and large investors, and with the remittance market turning unfavorable, the price suddenly dropped sharply by ten taels. The market stabilized and then weakened again. The British exchange rate continued to decline, and with the Indian exchange rate rising, sellers appeared like clouds on the trading floor, causing the price to fall further. It suddenly broke through the 730 tael mark. The large transactions this morning should be viewed as an upward trend.</p>
<p>Opening Market Sees a Drop　The opening price for the June market in the early morning dropped by 5.1 taels, to 734 taels. This was because the large transactions were down by one-quarter. The silver price only dropped by 3/8, mainly because China and the United States had some buying activity. Private telegraphs only showed a small decrease of one-quarter. Soon after, Yu Da, Zifeng Yong, and others bought, and the price quickly rebounded by 2.5 taels, reaching 36.5 taels. However, Yuan Mao Yong, Yongsheng, Datong, Taichang, Wanxingshun, and others had already sold off, leading to a further decline of over 4 taels, to 32 taels. Later, Yuan Mao Yong, Yu Da came to purchase, and British, Japanese banks absorbed 375, selling 3125. Since HSBC listed that it should reduce, increased over 7 taels, reaching to 39.5 taels. However, Qian Changxiang and other sellers immediately retreated to around 37 taels. Then Yuan Mao Yong, Tian Yu Yong, Gan Changxiang, Yu Da, etc. suddenly again began to purchase, and the British money only settled to two and a half, which appeared the peak of around 42 taels, and a bank also had to buy into , Later, Sheng Da, Da Xing Yong and hedging came to sell, market conditions turned from good to bad, the British money was also loose, can be settled to three and a half, The gold price gradually dropped by more than 9 taels, to 32 and a half taels at 10:40, but there were two or three tael transactions between, and the purchase was made after Yuan Cheng, and the price pulled over 3 taels, and soon the price was 35.78 taels when it was almost 11 o'clock, Da Decheng sold, and then retreated to 32 and a half taels, Bingxing bought in, and at 11:22, it was 5.2 taels, but Shengda, Zhifeng Yong, etc. didn't stop the idea of selling, the price fell 5 taels in half an hour, and the gold price was only calculated at 30 taels at noon. Yu Da and others came to purchase, and then pulled the price to over 2 taels, or 33 taels, until the market closed at 2.8 taels, and then raised to 4 taels again, and the reveal price was changed to 784.2 taels, with a rate of 45 taels to 42-43 taels, and noon closing price was 51-52 taels.</p>
<p>Steady Then Weakens Again　The afternoon market opened at 23.8 taels, followed by 4 taels. The Indian exchange rate reported a big drop of one or two annas, falling to 32 taels. Soon after, Yuan Mao Yong, Yu Fa Yong, and others entered the market to buy, and the bank absorbed 159 from Dalian, and British banks did business with each other at 375, so the gold price increased by more than 5 taels, reaching 37.3 taels around 2:30. Not long after, Zheng Jin and others sold 375 British gold, and Mitsui appeared at 15875 Dalian, causing the price to drop by more than 3 taels. News soon broke of a small earthquake in Japan, and Yuan Cheng Yong Heng, Yu Yuan Heng, and others sold, bringing the price to 31.5 taels at 3:15. Suddenly, it was pulled up to 4 taels. There were even more sellers at 3:30, and the British exchange rate weakened further. McAlister sold 4375, and then it could be settled at half a penny. Market sentiment turned downward, suddenly breaking through the 30 tael mark, eventually reaching 28 taels around 4:20. However, there were occasional fluctuations of one or two taels up and down. At the closing time of 4:30, it was 28.3 taels, a drop of 10.08 taels compared to the previous day. The highest price for the day was 42 taels, and the lowest price was 28 taels, a difference of 14 taels. The price of goods in the morning market was 34 taels, the noon closing was 33.5, and the afternoon was 3.7 taels. The closing price was 28.5. The revealed price was suppressed by a small 55-56 taels. The prices logged were 31 and 33 taels in the morning, and 26 and 28 taels in the afternoon. The water compensation was 27 taels in the morning and 22 taels in the afternoon.</p>

The real estate company decided to connect the British money, sell the ticket, and leave the set head 24 taels, which was close to the former, so the gold market situation was opposite to the previous day, and as a result, the exchange rate increased with the former afternoon compared to British money.

<h3 id="e127">The Tael Interest Rate Market is Still Chaotic <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview　The time at the end of April usually has a special bullish phenomenon, but this year, due to the sluggish commercial affairs and the difficulty in extending loans, the markets remain stagnant, simply waiting to see what happens, resulting in a very bleak situation, very different from the past. Therefore, there are no unusual peaks in the foreign interest rate or the silver interest rate, The interest rate market is slightly better because of the relationship between sales and stomach, but the silver interest rate is even more unbearable.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices　(Foreign interest rates) The morning interest rate was still seven qian two fen eight li eight hao seven hu half, without any difference from the previous day's noon market. The noon market softened slightly by one hao two hu half, to seven qian two fen eight li seven hao half, with the situation uncertain. However, according to general speculation, it will eventually rise. (Silver interest rates) The morning and noon markets remained at two fen, with the head and tail white, and the trend was extremely loose. It is appropriate that the silver interest rate should be in great demand, but there is this phenomenon. It is appropriate that the silver interest rate will collapse.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Cotton Market Downturn Begins <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market has turned weak, with a slight downturn emerging. This is mainly due to American and Indian cotton prices declining, leading to widespread pessimism and a lack of market confidence. However, gold prices remain strong, so Japanese merchants are still holding tightly. Actual sales to manufacturers are noticeably sluggish, with some selling off their holdings. Nevertheless, due to the high gold prices, foreign cotton still cannot be imported. Domestic cotton stocks from all sources are depleted, and inventory in local warehouses is low. Therefore, the cotton market situation is unusually complex. Although prices are high, foreign cotton cannot be imported, and there is concern that a major collapse may occur in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Grains, Rice Market Continues Weak <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, twenty to thirty boats arrived from various routes. Sales were extremely slow in the morning. High and low grades of northern japonica rice continued to weaken slightly, mainly due to a lack of inquiries. However, after the market closed, the weather suddenly turned overcast and rainy, so the overall trend seemed to stabilize. Early indica rice arrivals were sparse and sales were dull, with the market softening slightly. Yangxian rice sales were mediocre, with high grades extremely scarce. Trade in medium and lower grades was light, and the market weakened, with little change in the overall price. Duzi xian and local xian rice also experienced sluggish buying interest, with the situation showing weakness within stability. Baiyuan sales were not developing, but prices remained stable at their low levels.</p>
<p>Hunan: Yesterday, over ten boats arrived from the interior. Sales in this area were poor. In the early morning, various mechanically milled japonica rice were mostly quoted down by about one jiao. By noon, the market stabilized slightly due to rain, but transactions were still lackluster. Southern early indica rice was weak and lacked spirit, with only high-grade rice showing some activity, with prices showing little change. Yangdu and Jianlai rice arrivals were scarce and sales were slow, with little market fluctuation. The hanging yuan and fan rice markets were dull and lifeless, but fortunately, arrivals were limited, so prices remained unchanged, with top-grade hung hua rice still hovering around the 10 yuan mark.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Guangdong Merchants Search for Keyuan Rice <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Keyuan market showed renewed activity. Supplies of Keyuan rice in Shanghai were already scarce. Only the merchants and hoarders still had some inventory. After a search by Guangdong merchants, 750 bags of high-grade Hunan mechanically milled yuan rice were sold at a price of 14.12 yuan. 500 bags of upper-medium grade Jiangxi mechanically milled yuan rice were sold at a price of 13.70 yuan to 13.45 yuan. Prices were better than previous quotations.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Flour Market Stabilizes in the Afternoon <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for all months were quoted down by foreign wheat by approximately three to four jiao, resulting in an unusually sluggish market, down approximately one fen across the board compared to the previous day's close. The situation remained unfavorable. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, it initially stabilized. Later, due to overcast weather and rain, the attitude of inland merchants seemed to recover slightly, and there was increased speculative buying. Therefore, the market seemed to stabilize again. However, actual sales have recently slowed. Quotations in Tianjin are also weakening, and a favorable outlook is unlikely. As a result, the current month fell a small 2.5 li, May fell a large 2.5 li, June and August were unchanged, July fell a small 2.5 li, and September fell a large 2.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Wheat Market Weak in the Morning, Up in the Afternoon <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was particularly sluggish after opening in the morning. As spot goods for the current month were easily available, the lowest price fell to 3 taels, 9 qian, and 7 fen. Distant months followed suit, falling slightly by three to four fen. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, it was initially sluggish, but later, due to strength in the flour market and rainy weather, external buying interest revived. All months recovered three to four fen from their lowest prices. However, current wheat stocks in all warehouses are reportedly ample, and further gains are unlikely. As a result, the current month was unchanged, May rose a large 1 fen, June was unchanged, July rose a large 1 fen, August rose a small 1 fen, and September rose a small 2 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports from production areas indicated that Cuban spot sugar remained unchanged. New York sugar futures rose by two points for all months. Java spot and futures also remained unchanged. In the Public Association market, Dutch sugar #24 coarse white was relatively strong, with transactions still at 10.05 taels, and several thousand bags were traded. The market remained stable. Medium white was at 10 taels, #18 was at 9.9 taels, with very little activity. The rotation of Japanese sugar from the factory’s Meiji telegraph has changed. The price for 10,000 bags of delivery in May and June was 4.40 Japanese yen plus tax. At the same time, Minghua Sugar also opened with 10,000 bags, with delivery in May at 6.50 Japanese yen including tax. Because the two goods were tied together, the firms were still keen to import. Spot trading was rather quiet. YT brand was at 10.045 taels, YRO brand was at 9.925 taels, N brand was at 10.0525 taels, HS brand was at 10.015 taels. The market was generally flat. The Huaxin brand opened with over one thousand bags of spot blue sugar at 8 taels, but the market was flat. Domestic produced Banan Qing opened with 300-odd bags at 7.5 taels, up one qian from the previous market, and the brand owners were holding on tightly. Thus, the market appeared quite lively.</p>

<p>Recent arrivals of Hunan lotus seeds have been scarce. The Hankow market is flat. Top and middle grades are priced at 17.7 taels per dan, and Chang lotus seeds are priced at around 16 taels. Lower grades vary. Shanghai’s stock on hand is not particularly high. However, due to mediocre sales, prices have been difficult to increase. Only Ningbo’s buying interest is slightly better. There have been some sporadic transactions in this area. Yesterday’s market priced top-grade Xiangtan lotus seeds at 37-38 taels. Raozhou and Hengzhou lotus seeds sold for 32-33 taels. Tianjin gang lotus seeds sold for 29-30 taels. Changde lotus seeds sold for 28 taels.</p>

<p>The meteoric rise of the Douppion silk market this year has broken all previous records since the inception of Douppion silk. With strong sales of silk fabrics, Douppion silk is trending strong. With limited raw material supply, the price of Douppion cocoons is rising. As Douppion silk goods are in short supply and high demand, prices have risen sharply. Yesterday, Hangzhou silk merchants purchased 30 bales of Grade A Douppion silk at 730 taels, up another 10 taels from before.</p>

<p>Yesterday’s hardware transactions were brisk for out-of-town merchants but sluggish for local merchants. Therefore, export goods were quite lively. However, factory orders seemed quiet. Due to prior contractions, the prices of various goods were trending upwards, especially for black iron sheet and English steel plate. 18-gauge black iron sheet rose sharply by 2-3 qian yesterday, opening at 11.3 taels per dan, with 600-700 dan traded. Most buyers were from Tianjin. Merchants from Qingdao and Yantai also made some spot purchases. It is reported that many inland merchants have recently been inquiring. Given the limited inventory in Shanghai, the current market appears to have insufficient supply. English steel plate prices have been gradually increasing overseas recently, but arrivals have been very limited, so inventory is not large, and confidence is relatively good. Standards are therefore trending upwards. Export merchants from Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, etc., have also been buying more recently, and spot goods are becoming increasingly scarce. Prices are steadily increasing. Currently, 2.5 li is estimated at 9.25 taels per dan, 0.5 fen is at 7 taels, 7 li is at 6.75 taels, 1 fen is at 6.5 taels, and above 1.5 fen is estimated at 6.25 taels, up 2-4 qian from before.</p>

<p>The Hang An Company's Hwa Yang steamer struck a reef at Yushan, Yangnan, Wenzhou. This news has been reported in the newspaper twice. Yesterday, it was heard that the ship was completely sunk due to excessive damage. Fortunately, the crew and passengers were rescued. A detailed account is as follows:</p>
<p>Ship Body Damaged. The Hwa Yang steamer encountered fog at 2:30 p.m. on the 21st, and sailed to 122 degrees 14 minutes east longitude and 28 degrees 51 minutes 30 seconds north latitude, the extreme northwest corner of southern Yushan, ship body hitting a reef in the fog, striking the port side of the ship at 30 degrees. The impact was excessive and immediately ruptured the hull, and seawater rushed into the ship. At this time the ship's captain was very anxious, seeing that the ship would sink immediately, he sailed the ship towards the reef, hoping to beach the ship on the reef to avoid crew and passengers being caught off guard. As a result, the bow drove into the foot of the reef mountain and ran aground, while the stern was in the sea, allowing time to rescue the crew and passengers ashore. It took 24 hours for the ship to sink, but the bottom of the ship was pierced by the reef and the damage was indescribable.</p>
<p>Difficult Rescue. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Gong Ping steamship sailed to Ma'an Island to assist the Hwa Yang. At 5:50 p.m. on the 21st, the seawater had already risen to the deck of the Hwa Yang. The stern was completely submerged, leaving only one hull outside. Crew and passengers were all on southern Yushan. Gong Ping ship released two sampans, the first attempt capsized because of the large north wind waves, the second attempt was also overturned by huge waves, and one of the sampans had its bow broken by waves. One sailor almost lost his life and could not go to the rescue and had to withdraw and wait. The British Company's 16,000-ton giant ship Lagan Pootai arrived, and Gong Ping asked them to help with the rescue.</p>
<p>Crew and Passengers Transported to Hong Kong. The British Company's Lagan Pootai, began to release small sampans into the sea at 3:00 p.m. on the 22nd, after the fog dissipated and the waves settled, to go to southern Yushan to rescue the stranded people on the mountain in batches to its own ship. It took three hours to rescue all 114 crew and passengers. At 7:17 p.m., it left Ma'an Island and went straight to Hong Kong, sending a telegram to Shanghai. A total of 114 passengers and crew of the Hwa Yang ship were rescued at Ma'an Island and have been transported to Hong Kong. According to the Hwa Yang captain, all passengers and crew were rescued safely. Yesterday Hang An Company had translated the telegram and posted it in the office, so that family members of the passengers and crew could come and view it.</p>
<p>Ship Sinks. Yesterday at 11:00 a.m., Hang An Company first received a telegram from the Jianghai Customs Administration's Liujing, stating that the location of the Hwa Yang accident was at the extreme northwest of southern Yushan, the port side had broken and tilted into the sea, and everything from the observation deck to the stern had been completely destroyed and gone. At 12:50 p.m., they received a telegram from the Hwa Yang captain, Shakerov, stating that the ship had sunk and all crew and passengers had been rescued by British ships to Hong Kong. By yesterday afternoon, other than the bow on the reef, which had some traces, everything else had disappeared, with only one mast revealing the sea surface.</p>
<p>Three Ships Return. The rescue ship Gong Ping had already returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. Hang An staff went to the ship to ask about the situation. The captain of Gong Ping said that there was no hope of salvaging the Hwa Yang, that the crew and passengers were unharmed. The company had sent Fushin and Chengli ships to assist in the rescue, but when they were about to reach Ma'an Island, they received a radio message from the English ship stating that the Hwa Yang crew and passengers had been rescued and taken to Hong Kong, so there was no need to go. Therefore, Fushin ship had returned to Shanghai yesterday, and Chengli ship went to Shantou.</p>
<p>Warship to Prevent Theft. The area is frequented by pirates, and any shipwrecks attract them to rob the victims. This time, after the pirates waited for the Hwa Yang passengers to be rescued, they sent ships to southern Yushan to rob. Upon seeing the arrival of Liujing warship, they did not dare board the ship. The Ministry of the Navy also complied with Hang An's request and ordered the Yongji ship stationed in Chuanshan to sail to the area to prevent robbery and plunder. Both warships have arrived in the area to protect it.</p>
<p>Pay off the Crew and Passengers. Upon receiving news of the crew and passengers' rescue, Hang An Company’s manager Huang Xingge sent a radio message to the British ship Lagan Pootai, to be relayed to Chen Youbai, one of the rescued people, instructing him to represent the company, take the 113 rescued people, arrange for food and accommodation after arriving in Hong Kong, and instruct people in Hong Kong to raise funds to buy ship tickets for the rescued passengers going to Fujian and pay for them to return to their hometowns. The other crew members and sailors are asked to find a way to return to Shanghai by ship. The telegram has been sent. Chen Youbai is the shipowner of Fushin and a good friend of Huang Xingge. This time, he was also on the Hwa Yang ship going to Fujian and was also a victim of the shipwreck.</p>
<p>Inform Family Members. Yesterday, Hang An Company had notified the passengers' families of the shipwreck and rescue of crew and passengers. Many of the sailors’ dependents, passengers' relatives, etc., came to the company to inquire. The company immediately showed them the telegrams and waited for the shipowners and crew members to return to Shanghai to inquire about the true story of the accident and the extent of the damage, and then decide whether to salvage it or not. It is still uncertain.</p>

<p>Yang Hu Narrowly Escapes Assassination</p>
<p>Communists Induce Gatekeeper to Murder Yang</p>
<p>Wu Youcai Confesses Unreservedly After Capture</p>
<p>Accomplices Shi Youheng and Three Others Also Arrested</p>
<p>Guowenshe reports that Yang Hu, Military Advisor to the National Government, has been residing on Avenue du Capitaine D'Allonville in the French Concession since retiring from his position as Garrison Commander of Songhu. He seems to be mostly uninvolved with military and political affairs. However, the communists deeply resented Yang's past animosity and plotted to assassinate him. However, Yang's protection was strict, and they could not find an opportunity. Recently, the gatekeeper employed at Yang's residence was induced to join the Communist Party, and the matter of assassinating Yang occurred. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and he escaped harm. The assassination plot is summarized below.</p>
<p>Regular Precautions. Yang Hu, also known as Xiaotian, is from Ningguo, Anhui Province. He initially followed Sun Yat-sen to engage in revolution, experiencing great hardship. After the National Revolutionary Army established its position in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Chairman Chiang appointed Yang as the Garrison Commander of Songhu. Shortly after, the split between Nanjing and Wuhan occurred, and Yang deeply hated the communists, vowing to eliminate them. The communists at that time hated Yang as if he were a thorn in their side. Therefore, in recent years, Yang's precautions have been stringent. Every time Yang went out, in addition to hiring guards, he also carried two revolvers to defend himself against harm from villains.</p>
<p>The Bandits Cannot Take Advantage. The bandits saw that Yang's precautions were strict and could not find an opportunity. They changed their strategy, planning to induce those close to him and bribe them with huge sums of money to kill Yang in the interim. Therefore, the communist party has been unusually active recently and has been paying close attention to Yang. It is rumored that the party recently had the slogan "If Yang is not removed, the Communist Party will never be able to do as it pleases." They tried every means, and Yang's gatekeeper, Wu Youcai, a native of Jiangpu, was induced to join the Communist Party to assist them. However, Heaven's net is vast, and the matter was discovered by the Yang family's servants, who immediately ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to send police to arrest him. He surrendered on the 21st of this month.</p>
<p>The Case is Solved. Since Wu Youcai started working at Yang's residence, he has been diligent and cautious, and he has not gone out except during work hours. Therefore, Yang regarded Wu Youcai very highly and praised him repeatedly. Recently, Wu changed his behavior. When he went out, he did not return all night. When asked where he went, he gave vague answers. The family members felt that the gatekeeper's responsibility was related to the safety of the entire family. Even if there was an accident, he would not return in the middle of the night, and there was no one to answer the door. Therefore, suspicion arose. One day, Wu was seen going out, and personnel were secretly sent to follow him. Later, because his actions were suspicious, with the suspicion that he was meeting with bandits, they reported it to Yang, who sent a letter to the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Chen Xizeng, asking him to send police to arrest Wu. He was arrested on the 21st and taken to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Confesses to Assassination. After Wu was arrested on the 21st, the Public Security Bureau added to the interrogation, as the case was related to harming important party and government figures. As a result, Wu also knew that he could not hide it and revealed everything. The most important point in his confession was "After I joined the Communist Party, the accomplices wanted to kill Yang, but they could not succeed due to his strict protection. Recently, I received orders from the communists to assassinate Yang." At the same time, after several detailed inquiries, he also implicated accomplices Shi Youheng, Zhu Lianxiang, Luo Qiting, etc., who have also been arrested. The bureau is currently interrogating them and is strictly pursuing other remaining accomplices.</p>

<p>Joint Shanghai Industrial Survey</p>
<p>To Commence Regionally on May 1st</p>
<p>Aims to Clarify the Status of Industry</p>
<p>The Statistics Bureau of the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget plans to conduct a national industrial census, with a set procedure starting in Shanghai. Simultaneously, the Ministry of Industries intends to survey specific industries in Shanghai. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, noting significant changes since the last industrial survey, also plans a follow-up investigation. Therefore, at the Statistics Bureau's suggestion, the two agencies will use the same forms and conduct the surveys concurrently. This will spare factories the burden of repeated surveys and achieve twice the results with half the effort for the government. After drafting the plan, the National Chiao Tung University Research Institute and economics students also sought to participate, as they had a project to collaboratively study the transportation of industrial goods and the competition between domestic and foreign goods. They planned a survey, and now the three agencies and two academic groups have jointly established the Shanghai Industrial Survey Joint Office. Zhang Zongbi, a staff member from the Statistics Bureau, has been appointed as the survey director, and over ten staff members from the various agencies and groups, including Lin Mingqi, will serve as surveyors. Starting on the 27th of this month, they will first visit major factories, and from May 1st, a general survey will be conducted regionally. All surveyors will be issued special survey certificates with their half-body photo attached and stamped with the official seal of the Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs for identification. However, fearing that factories may not be fully aware or understand the survey's purpose and methods, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been notified to inform member factories and trade associations, clarifying that this joint survey of Shanghai factories aims to understand the position of domestic industry in order to find ways to promote and protect it, with no other purpose. They hope that factories will provide accurate and detailed information without hesitation.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Customs Brokerage Industry Labor Dispute <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Bureau of Social Affairs Conducted Final Mediation Yesterday</p>
<p>Parties Insisted on Negotiations Until 8 PM with No Results</p>
<p>Over Two Hundred Workers Marched to the Municipal Party Headquarters to Petition</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the Shanghai customs brokerage workers' strike, the customs brokerage industry association, and the cotton cloth industry association have not reached a concrete solution through negotiations, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs convened another mediation yesterday to expedite a resolution. The meeting continued until evening, but the issue of customs inspection fees could not be resolved due to the parties' insistence, so it was adjourned. The parties will deliberate on their own before a decision is made, and the three associations will hold a general meeting today to discuss the matter. Yesterday, workers went to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Workers' Petition: Over two hundred members of the Customs Brokerage Workers' Union marched to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition at 11:00 AM yesterday. The march was led by Wang Huihe and Cheng Pinshun, with Zhang Yusheng and Bi Nanshan serving as marshals. They carried small white bamboo cloth petition flags and wore petition bamboo cloth symbols bearing the union's seal for identification. Their demands were: (1) Regarding the cotton cloth transportation fee case at our factory, please send a letter to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs requesting enforcement of the previously issued Notice No. 9097. (2) The opening of the docks concerns the issue of Western and Eastern goods and is not related to cotton cloth at our factory, so it cannot be combined. Chen Junyi, a standing committee member of the Civil Training Association, instructed staff member Zhu Yakui to receive the petitioners. Due to the large number of workers, it was inconvenient to inquire, so he ordered the appointment of representatives to proceed. Subsequently, Sun Liansheng, Fang Pinghe, Su Houxin, and He Xixiang were appointed as representatives. As a result, the workers' demands were accepted, and they were promised that personnel would be dispatched immediately to mediate with the Bureau of Social Affairs. Thereupon, all the workers, feeling satisfied, returned to their union.</p>
<p>Mediation Process: At 2:00 PM yesterday, the Bureau of Social Affairs convened representatives from the Customs Brokerage Association, the Cotton Market Association, and the Customs Brokerage Workers' Union to mediate. Present were Chen Songyuan and Ke Ganchen, representatives from the Cotton Cloth Industry Association; Shi Zhikun and Zhu Xieshen, representatives from the Customs Brokerage Association; and Su Houxin and Ren Xixiang, representatives from the Customs Brokerage Workers' Union. Guo Yongxi of the Bureau of Social Affairs presided over the meeting, and Jiang Shifu served as the recorder. The chairman began by stating that the cause of the dispute was the Cotton Cloth Industry Association's decision that the transportation fees for customs brokerage should be borne by the merchants themselves, which led to opposition from the Workers' Union. The bureau had convened mediation previously, but it was shelved because the two sides had requested to settle the matter privately outside the meeting. It was reported that the matter had not been resolved to date, so the representatives were convened again for discussion. He also stated that the Cotton Cloth Industry Association had previously agreed to add two dimes for transportation, regardless of the distance, but the Customs Brokerage had not agreed. In the chairman's opinion, if a contract were not established now, it would likely cause future disturbances. He asked the representatives for their opinions. Next, the representatives expressed their opinions. The Customs Brokerage Association's representatives stated that they were willing to negotiate as long as their industry did not suffer any losses. The Cotton Cloth Association's representatives believed that the transportation fee issue was entirely the responsibility of the merchants and should be collected directly from the merchants by the Workers' Union and should not be borne by their industry. Furthermore, the various terms had been roughly agreed upon at the previous meeting at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, but the Customs Brokerage Association had failed to acknowledge them at the time. Regarding the issue of losses, the answer could be simply that the Customs Brokerage industry pays wages to its workers and the Cotton Cloth industry should not be responsible for transportation fees. Furthermore, the association represents over two hundred companies and is not limited to cotton cloth (meaning it is not limited to domestic cloth). The chairman then stated that this case could be considered a commercial dispute and not a labor-management dispute. The Customs Brokerage Association could not shirk its responsibility and hoped that the parties could understand each other. He then inquired about the representatives' positions on the transportation fee issue: (1) The Workers' Union representatives proposed that for the three docks, Osaka, Huangpu, and the Warehouse, each transportation trip should be uniformly five dimes. (2) The Customs Brokerage Association proposed that the new docks, such as Gonghexing and Huishan, should also be included in the calculation. At this point, the chairman convened individual talks with representatives from the three parties for questions and explanation. After the questions, they first discussed the second dock issue proposed by the Cotton Cloth Association. They proposed that for the four docks, Osaka, Huangpu, the Warehouse, and Huishan, the Cotton Cloth industry would pay 2.5 dimes and the Customs Brokerage Association would pay 1.5 dimes, totaling four dimes. However, as the Customs Brokerage Association did not agree, it was temporarily put aside. Then, they discussed the terms and the customs inspection fee issue. Because the two sides argued fiercely and could not resolve the matter, the meeting was adjourned. A decision will be made after each side has considered the matter further.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Jinxin Factory Labor Dispute Resolved Yesterday <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The labor strike at the Jinxin Silk Weaving Factory on Avenue du Lieutenant Petiot in the French Concession had lasted for over thirty days. The Bureau of Social Affairs had mediated six times, but the company refused to reinstate Sun Maoer and five others and denied wages for the strike period, resulting in a failed mediation. Yesterday, the municipal government convened an arbitration committee, and the arbitration resulted in: (1) Wages to be paid as usual for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Memorial Day. (2) Sun Maoer and five others to be allowed to return to work. (3) A subsidy of ten yuan per person for meals during the strike period. The labor side was satisfied. The members of the labor union were summoned to have a general meeting on Monday to resume work. However, Sun Maoer's injuries are severe, and he may not be able to work for a while. The Special District Court held a hearing yesterday. The defendant was not present, and the plaintiff Sun Maoer appeared in court, despite being ill. The judge questioned him about the assault and the doctor examined his injuries. The hearing was scheduled for Thursday.</p>

<p>Over Four Thousand Veteran Workers Requesting Re-Employment</p>
<p>After the new owner of the Sanxin Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road, General Manager Rong Zongjing, took over, he appointed Wu Kunsheng as the factory manager and Wu Tuhuai and Wang Shizhang as the chief and assistant engineers, respectively. The handover has now been completed, and it was announced that the factory would reopen on the 27th of this month, with worker registration beginning on the 21st. All the veteran workers immediately went to register. Because the factory required that the registration procedures be conducted with a new employee as an introducer, over four thousand veteran workers became alarmed and sent representatives, Tian Sanzi and Hou Jiahai, to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday to petition, requesting that the factory comply with the previous agreement to re-employ them and not refuse work. The bureau dispatched personnel to investigate and verify the matter for further action.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Transport Fee for Silver Dollars to Increase by 20% <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>To Be Increased from May 1st</p>
<p>The silver and cash industries in Shanghai have historically contracted land transport of silver dollars to Da Feng (Jing-Hu Railway) and Tong He (Hu-Hang-Yong Railway) companies. This time, due to the railway authorities' decision to increase passenger and freight fares uniformly by 20%, the companies sent letters stating that silver dollars should not be treated the same as passengers and freight and requested an exemption. Subsequently, they received approval to temporarily exempt the silver dollar transport fee pending further instructions from the Ministry of Railways to the railway authorities. Now, the Department of Railways has issued instructions from the Ministry of Railways (Number: Ye Zi 10995), stating that the current rates may be temporarily maintained, but starting May 1st, transport fees will be uniformly collected at the increased rate of 20%. All banks and money houses must be officially notified, and their subordinates must comply. After receiving the letter from the two companies, the Money Trade Association recorded the official letter and the Ministry of Railways' instructions for the market so that all members would know what to do.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Letter from the Anti-Opium Society to Organizational Groups <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Bai Case is Entirely False Accusations</p>
<p>Earnestly Hoping for Strong Support</p>
<p>Bai Zhiying, the wife of Huang Jiawei, General Secretary of the Chinese National Anti-Opium Society, has been falsely accused of trafficking morphine and was investigated by the Hong Kong Customs. The matter has been proven untrue by Huang and his wife, the society's standing committee, the municipal party headquarters, and the Hong Kong Customs. The rumors are baseless. These details have been reported previously. The society is deeply concerned that the accusers will not succeed in their defamation and will continue to implement plans to sabotage the society, which is very important to the future of the Anti-Opium movement. They sent letters to the associated groups of the society, asking them to uphold justice and provide practical assistance. The original letter is recorded as follows: Respected Sirs, Some time ago, the society's General Secretary Huang Jiawei and his wife, Ms. Bai Zhiying, went to Taiwan to inspect the opium ban. Suddenly, it was falsely alleged that Ms. Huang trafficked morphine and was investigated by the Hong Kong Customs. The news spread widely, and all circles at home and abroad paid close attention. Huang and his wife submitted counter-evidence, and the society's standing committee and various party headquarters thoroughly investigated the matter and declared it to be untrue. Recently, the Hong Kong Customs also proved that it was completely unfounded. All of this has been disclosed in the newspapers. Huang worked hard to combat opium and was falsely accused. All comrades feel injustice. The society has drafted the following response: (1) Please ask the authorities to severely punish the person who fabricated the rumors and accusations and impose the penalty for false accusations. (2) Write to the Chinese and foreign newspapers to uphold justice based on the facts and clear the names of Mr. Huang and his wife. (3) Send telegrams to anti-opium groups in the various local branches nationwide to clarify the facts for Mr. Huang and his wife to dispel doubts and clarify the truth. Your Society has always sympathized with opium and has been especially concerned about the Society. Apart from actively handling the above-mentioned matters, we also hope that you will uphold justice to correct public opinion and maintain the anti-opium movement. It is expected that the other party's conspiracy will not succeed and will continue to carry out various acts of sabotage against the Society. It is hoped that all parties will understand the situation and provide spiritual and practical support. The future of the society depends on it. We hereby inform you. Respectfully yours, The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society.</p>

<p>Shoots and Kills a Worker</p>
<p>American Sailor Has No Gun License</p>
<p>Shooting and Killing People While Blaming Being Beaten</p>
<p>The Deceased's Brother Will File a Lawsuit</p>
<p>The Western-style house at 15 Fair Road, Broadway Road, Hongkou, is owned by Zhu Shichang. Recently, the house was damaged, and Zhu hired nine workers, including Gu Jingen "30 years old", Chen Guiqing, etc., to repair it. It has been many days. Suddenly, a tragedy occurred at around half past midnight yesterday morning. The workers suddenly had a verbal dispute with the American sailor and Ms. Si (transliteration) living on the second floor of the house, and immediately opened fire with a pistol, causing Gu Jingen to be seriously injured and killed on the spot. The Huishan Patrol Station in charge of the area ordered detectives to investigate and brought the body to the Fellen Road autopsy station. Yesterday morning, Guo Huaipu, the prosecutor of the Special District Court, was commissioned to the institute. Under examination, he ascended to the case. According to the complaint from witness Chen Guiqing and others, we have been working inside for four or five days and staying inside at night. Last night, we were talking when the Westerner and Ms. Si came and said a few words to us in Western language. Because we don't understand Western language, we don't know what they said. So they closed the room tightly, and immediately shot into the door with a pistol outside the door, about eight or nine shots. Gu was shot and killed. But Ms. Si confessed that I and my wife were asleep that night, and suddenly heard someone opening the door of the bathroom. My wife was quite surprised, so she went to the worker and surrounded me and beat me. Then they closed the door, and I went to get a pistol. They knew it and ran out again, and beat me fiercely again. For self-defense, I fired a shot, not as many as nine shots. Mr. Guo asked if his pistol had a license. He replied that this gun was brought to Shanghai from the United States five years ago and has not been registered. Then Gu Lu, the widow of the deceased, complained that there was a four-year-old son and a ten-year-old daughter in the family, and no one to support them. She asked for a pension. However, Gu Awu, the brother of the deceased, said that he did not want to receive a pension and had to file a lawsuit with the governing office. Mr. Guo then ruled that Gu Jingen, the deceased, was shot and killed by the Westerner and Ms. Si. The body was allowed to be buried by his wife Gu Lu after signing a settlement.</p>
<p>The "Ta Mei Evening News" said that Qiu Fushi, a mechanic from the American Yangtze Fleet's Monteno Kaiser ship, shot and killed the coolie Gu Qinggong (transliteration) in self-defense at 0:15 a.m. this morning (23rd). After the Special District Court sent personnel to examine the body, Qiu Fushi was exempted from criminal responsibility because he did not intentionally kill anyone. He was released together with the nine coolies present. However, Gu A'er, the brother of the deceased, refused to accept the pension and claimed that he would file a lawsuit with the American Inspector's Office. It is expected that this case may not avoid a legal battle. As for the content of this case, both sides have different opinions. When the body was examined this morning, Western detective Bai Lake testified that he suddenly heard the sound of a police whistle when patrolling Fair Road last night. He went to inquire and caught a glimpse of a Westerner with a pistol in his hand in the window of the dormitory at 15 Fair Road. Three other Chinese were crouching on the wall corner outside the window. When he entered the house to check, Gu Qinggong had died in the back room. After inquiring, he learned that the house was being repaired and the deceased was guarding the materials with several workers and living in the back room. Then, in the neighboring bathroom, he found a .45 caliber automatic pistol. He then took the Westerner Qiu Fushi and the nine coolies present back to the police station. One of the coolies was a cook hired by 8 Fair Road. Later, Qiu Fushi confessed that he was 30 years old and did not really intend to kill the deceased. It was only because the coolies wanted to attack him, so he fired into the air to scare them. It was not until the Western detective arrived that he learned that Gu had been shot and killed. The incident occurred at about 0:15 a.m. He was in dreamland when he was suddenly awakened by his wife, who said that someone had entered the room. He still thought that his wife was hallucinating due to excessive shock. Just as he was about to comfort her, the light of a flashlight shone on the bed. He jumped up from the bed, and the intruder fled to the back room. Behind his room door, he returned to the bedroom to get a pistol. The gun was brought from the United States five years ago, and he did not get a license because it was not used often. When he took the gun in his hand and was about to call the police, he heard the coolies trying to pry open the door to the neighboring bathroom. He then turned to another passage in the back of the room and saw that the door was half open. A coolie was standing behind the door with a giant stick, apparently waiting for him to pass by before attacking him. He then fired a shot into the air, intending to call the police. When the police arrived, they saw that the coolie had died. The bullet penetrated the door and hit his left jaw, etc. However, according to Chen Guiqing, a coolie present, it was different, saying that how dare the coolies attack a foreign sailor for no reason. In fact, it was because everyone was chatting around 11 p.m. last night when a child entered the room. Everyone drove him out. The child took the ladder and left, preventing everyone from going downstairs, because the stairs had been dismantled at that time. There was no way to go downstairs without the ladder. At 12:15, the worker surnamed Gu wanted to go to the bathroom and planned to pass through Qiu Fushi's bedroom to reach the front stairs. The sailor woke up, furious, and started beating the workers. While the workers were fleeing, Gu wanted to close the door, but Qiu shot and killed him. Finally, the coroner said that after inquiring about this case, Qiu Fushi did not intentionally shoot and kill. Now the deceased's family has a widow, a ten-year-old daughter, and a four-year-old son, who are poor and helpless. It is better to give them a pension and settle the matter peacefully. He then turned to ask Lieutenant Colonel Howard of the American warship how much the American Navy planned to give as a pension. He said that he wanted to know first whether these coolies were allowed to live upstairs and break into Qiu's room. At that time, the brother of the deceased claimed that he did not want to accept the pension and demanded that the person who opened fire and committed the crime be punished. The coroner then advised that the family of the deceased had two options: either file a lawsuit with the American Inspector's Office, or agree on a pension and settle the case through both parties. The remains are allowed to be claimed by the family for coffin burial. According to reports, Qiu Fushi rented the place with his wife in February. He first lived downstairs, but moved upstairs yesterday due to repairs. The pistol was his personal property and has been taken away by him along with the bullets.</p>

<p>The Question of Female Patrol Officers</p>
<p>A Meeting Will Be Held to Decide After Talking with Johnson</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Organizations Joint Committee recently wrote to the Public Works Department, requesting the employment of female patrol officers in the concession. Later, the Public Works Department replied that the time was not yet appropriate. Recently, the committee responded to the request of the Police Committee and recommended representatives Ms. Elton and Ms. Smith to participate in the police meeting, so as to continue to state their opinions on the issue. After Ms. Elton attended the meeting, she deeply regretted that Mr. Johnson, a travel commissioner of the League of Nations, was suddenly ill and could not attend the meeting, because he had expertise in this issue. The chairman said that the Police Superintendent had visited the members of the travel group and discussed everything. After consultation between the Public Works Department and the Superintendent, it was decided to postpone the issue of employing female patrol officers until Major Jollard returned to Shanghai from England, and then consider it again. Then, at the request of the chairman, the two ladies stated their opinions on why female patrol officers must be prepared in the concession, mainly stating that female patrol officers in Western countries all patrol the streets, but the situation in Shanghai is different, and it is not convenient for them to be assigned to street patrols. Female patrol officers in Shanghai should manage the taking of confessions and inspections of those who commit crimes against children and women, and women who engage in improper behavior on the road, because it is difficult for men to do these things. The women mentioned by the two representatives specifically refer to foreigners. The two representatives then asked the Public Works Department whether it could first invite a foreign female police expert to investigate whether the situation in Shanghai is suitable for female patrol officers. If it is suitable, the Public Works Department can first hire a foreign female patrol officer, and then consider the situation to hire more to deal with Chinese women committing crimes. After the two representatives stated their opinions, the members of the Police Committee said that the various points stated were either without a solution, or if they were to be hired, they could not be effective with just three or five people. The Public Works Department really does not have the financial resources to maintain this. Then the two representatives asked the chairman to allow Johnson to meet within the next week, so as to continue to make suggestions. The chairman agreed, and everything will be decided at a meeting after talking with Johnson.</p>

<p>The Auntie Spoke Sadly</p>
<p>Her Husband Went to Jail for Committing a Crime</p>
<p>The Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Slept Together Under One Quilt</p>
<p>The Daughter-in-Law Wanted to Remarry, But It Was Not Allowed</p>
<p>So She Had No Choice But to End It All</p>
<p>At around 6 p.m. the night before, a beautiful young woman in a cheongsam went to the Bund Wharf on Jiujiang Road alone, hailed a No. 106 sampan, and said that she would cross to Pudong. At that time, she paid 33 copper coins for the fare. When the sampan rocked to the center of the river, the young woman suddenly jumped into the river and committed suicide. Her body sank and floated again. Xin Shunlai, the sampanman, was shocked to see this and immediately used a bamboo pole to hook her clothes to save her. When asked why she jumped into the river, the young woman remained silent and only wept. Xin then sent her to the water patrol station and took dry clothes for her to change temporarily. After changing, she confessed that her name was Chen Aju, 18 years old, from Ninghai, Zhejiang. She lived at No. 257 Jinghe Lane, opposite Xuedou Temple, Xinjibang Road. She married Hu Tianyou, a fellow villager, at the age of 15. Her husband used to work as a steward on a Yi Tai Company ship, and his monthly salary was still abundant. At the end of the year before last, he was arrested by the Huishan Patrol Station in Tilanqiao for privately selling pistols and handed over to the court, which sentenced him to seven years in prison. He is still detained in prison and will not be released for another four or five years, resulting in the termination of the family's livelihood and extreme poverty. Last year, I gave birth to a daughter, who was sent by my mother-in-law to other people to raise. Now, because it is difficult to make a living, I am seeking death by throwing myself into the river. The head of the patrol temporarily ordered her to stay at the patrol station for one night. Yesterday morning, Detective Cheng Yongnian was sent to summon her aunt and explain the situation. Her aunt went to the patrol station weeping and confessed a tragic family situation. She said that her surname was Hu Guo, and she had two sons. The eldest son died of illness in March last year, leaving behind two children, seven and four years old. The eldest daughter-in-law suffered this great disaster and cried all day long, repeatedly holding the idea of seeking death. On January 30 of this year, she also died in her hometown. So I sent the two grandchildren to my aunt's house for safekeeping. Recently, because of the death of the eldest daughter-in-law, I took a wheel back to my hometown once to inquire and learned that my aunt had abused my two grandchildren. The older one was given a bowl of rice every day, and the younger one was given half a bowl, so they were so hungry that their faces were yellow and skinny. Later, I secretly took rice for the two grandchildren to eat, which caused a quarrel with my aunt. I returned to Shanghai in anger and found that the second daughter-in-law was missing. It turned out that last year, the second son, Tianyou, was imprisoned for selling pistols. Last year, the eldest son died, and the family was extremely poor. Only my second daughter-in-law Chen (i.e., the one who threw herself into the river) and I live in Shanghai. There is only one quilt on the bed, and the two of us sleep together. Chen wears a cheongsam outside now, and she only has one shirt. She washes it every time she is about to go to bed, and wears it again the next day after it is dry. This kind of life cannot be described in words. At this point, she burst into tears. Chen often went out because she could not bear the suffering. Last year, she gave birth to a daughter and refused to give her milk. I thought she would starve to death, but I couldn't bear it, so I sent her to other people to raise. Recently, when I returned to Shanghai from my hometown, Chen was not at home again. After many inquiries, I learned that she had an affair with a Mr. Yao, an employee of a tobacco company. However, Yao earns only 40 or 50 yuan a month, and he already has a wife at home. Chen is willing to be a concubine. Recently, she asked me in person to agree. I was angry when I heard this and answered that although your husband is in jail for committing a crime, he will eventually be released in four or five years. Although it is hard now, there will be a day for a comeback in the future, etc. Chen saw that I insisted on not agreeing, presumably the matter was hopeless, and she was unwilling to live this hard life at home, so she committed suicide without telling anyone. The staff of the patrol station sighed after hearing this. The head of the patrol ordered Guo to take her daughter-in-law back and persuade her to avoid repeating the same path.</p>

<p>A Man and a Woman Checked In, One Died and One Escaped</p>
<p>The Woman Was Lying Stiffly in the Quilt, Seemingly Strangled to Death</p>
<p>At around 2:45 p.m. the day before, a man and a woman came to the Sanjiang Hotel at 12 Beihai Road. The man was wearing a gray coat and a cap, speaking with a Songjiang accent. The woman was about 25 years old, wearing a camel-hair short jacket, with short hair and not very beautiful. The man spoke with the same accent as the man. The man first told the front desk that his surname was Wang, his name was Quanlong, 27 years old, from Songjiang, and the woman's surname was Zhu. The waiter led them to Room 33 upstairs to rest. The two of them drank some tea in the room. At around 4 p.m., they went out together, and before leaving, they ordered the waiter to change their names at the front desk. So, it was noted in the circulation book that the man was Wang Desheng, and the woman was Zhang. At 11 p.m. that night, the two of them came back, closed the door, and went to sleep. At 7 a.m. yesterday morning, Wang got up first and went out alone, and told the waiter not to disturb the female guest and let her sleep peacefully. After speaking, he left. At 9 a.m., a Lu Ruisheng came to visit Wang Desheng. Because Wang was not there, he left a name card and left. At noon, the waiter wanted to ask the female guest whether she wanted to continue the room. He shouted outside the door several times, but there was no reply. So he pried open the door and entered. The room was silent. The bedding on the bed was piled high. The female guest surnamed Zhang was lying in the middle. When he uncovered the quilt, the woman was dead. She was lying stiffly on her side, facing inward. There was a silk trouser belt around her neck. She was strangled to death. When he looked again, there was also some blood on her mouth. He immediately reported to the patrol station, which sent detectives to investigate. In addition to taking the clothes left behind back to the patrol station, the doctor also examined the female corpse. At the same time, detectives were sent to Fengjing and other places to investigate the escaped Wang Desheng.</p>

<p>Marriage Introduction Agencies</p>
<p>Beautifully Named Marriage Research Association</p>
<p>Municipal Government Sends Letter to French Consulate to Strictly Ban Them</p>
<p>The Municipal Government yesterday, in order to ban marriage introduction agencies, specially sent a letter to French Consul General Koechlin, to swiftly and strictly ban them in order to maintain public morals and avoid causing harm to society. The original letter stated: "Regarding the matter approved by the Ministry of Interior, Document No. 36, concerning the instruction of affairs: According to a report in the *Shanghai Sun* newspaper on March 9th, in a certain lane on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession of Shanghai, there is a marriage introduction agency called the Marriage Research Association. Although it has not been registered, it is working hard and has introduced many men and women who have become married couples. The person in charge is a certain Tao, etc. After investigating marriage introduction agencies, Zhang Junlin, a citizen of this capital, submitted a request to establish one, asking for prior registration, etc. The ministry responded by saying that in our country, marriage has always valued the words of matchmakers, as a way to unite two surnames and to begin proper human relations. Historically, matchmakers have always been relatives and old friends. We have never heard of matchmaking as a profession, likening people to horse traders. As for the official matchmaker established in the Rites of Zhou, they were in charge of national laws and regulations, and their duties were like today's registration. The government has its own plans for unified management, which cannot be imitated by the people. Moreover, the current principle is that men and women determine their own engagements. How can one seize a passerby to advise them and make them responsible for introductions? The proposal to organize a marriage introduction agency so that single men and women can all become good couples is contrary to ancient customs and new systems and is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. It is not suitable for our national conditions and may lead to bad customs. The request is not approved, and a special rejection is issued. Zhang Junlin's original submission mentioned that Shanghai already had such organizations, so the report in the newspaper seems to be based on fact. However, it is a stain that the French Concession allows the establishment of such illegal places, and methods should be devised to ban them in order to rectify morals and avoid providing excuses. Accordingly, we request that you investigate and handle this matter according to the law and that you provide a response." Based on this, on October 30th of last year, we received a letter from the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, stating that the "Chinese National Seven Rights Marriage Election Association" was established at No. 48, Lane 1, Baoyu Lane, Dongxin Bridge, French Concession, with absurd content and should be banned. We then sent a letter to your Consul General requesting that the ban be enforced. Later, on November 14th of the same year, we received a reply stating that the police had been instructed to investigate. According to the reply, two people had lived there in July, claiming to be members of the association, but they were not seen receiving outsiders or holding meetings, etc., and they moved away in early September, and their whereabouts are unknown. Now, according to the *Shanghai Sun* newspaper, there is a marriage introduction agency called the Marriage Research Association in a certain lane on Avenue Joffre. It is not known whether this is a disguised form of the previous Election Association. However, any similar organization is harmful to public morals and should be strictly banned to avoid causing harm to society. In addition to the reply, we are sending this letter, hoping that you will investigate and instruct for a strict ban and that you will provide a response. Addressed to Koechlin, French Consul General in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Music Hall Bid Price Unacceptable and Undecided</p>
<p>The first phase of the project to renovate the Temple of Confucius and rebuild the park is being undertaken by the San Sen Construction Company. Construction has been underway for nearly two months and is expected to be completed by the end of May of this year. The second phase of the project is scheduled to be opened for bidding at 2:00 PM tomorrow at the Municipal Bureau of Public Works.

The official bidding began at 2:30 PM. Bureau Chief Shen Yi and Municipal Government representatives Xu Shijie and Lu Dianyang from the Bureau of Education supervised the opening of the bids. The bidders included Yu Sheng, Zhen Ji, He Xing Company, Zhao Jianji, San Sen Construction Company, Zhu Senji, Fang Yuanji, etc. As a result, it was decided that Zhu Senji won the bid with a price of 20,139 yuan. The bureau will sign a contract with Zhu Senji in the coming days to begin construction. The bid price for the music hall was unacceptable, so it was not decided. The bureau had previously estimated all construction costs through engineering experts.</p>

<p>Tenants Resist Landlord's Rent Increase</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, all 140 households of tenants in Lizhong Lane at the end of Yuezhou Road and Feihong Road in Hongzhen in this city are resisting an illegal rent increase and unreasonable oppression by the landlord, Chen Changkun. The tenants held a reception for the press of this city at the Pacific Western Restaurant the night before last, attended by more than ten people. During the reception, representatives of the tenants reported that in January of last year, the landlord suddenly announced a rent increase to the tenants under the pretext of the Finance Bureau collecting a 14% housing tax. After repeated negotiations, the result was that stone-framed doors and shop houses would be increased by one dollar, and Cantonese-style houses would be increased by half a dollar, starting from April of the 19th year of the Republic. The rental agent, Ju Kangzhuang, formally agreed in writing that the rent would not be increased again for three years. Unexpectedly, after only eight months, Ju Kangzhuang transferred the rental to the Huada Foreign Firm, which arbitrarily set various harsh conditions and laid off two gatekeepers and patrolmen, resulting in two robberies and one assassination in the lane within a week. Unexpectedly, the landlord continued to act recklessly, again transferring the rental of the houses to the China Business Company. The conditions set were even more harsh than when the Huada Foreign Firm was the rental agent, and it was announced that the rent would be increased by 30% from February 1st. The tenants could no longer tolerate this and began to unite to oppose it, requesting that justice be upheld and assistance be provided. It is also heard that the tenants have now formally filed a lawsuit to seek a legal solution. It is reported that the local court has notified both parties to appear in court for trial on the 28th.</p>

<p>Huaxin Lane on Yangshupu Road in this city has newly built houses. The houses are owned by the wealthy Sheng family and rented out by the Huizhong Banking Corporation. Most of the tenants are workers from nearby factories. The company suddenly announced to all tenants that the rent would be increased by 50% per house in the market (from the original rent of 24 yuan to 36 yuan) and by 40% per room in the lane (from the original rent of 15.2 yuan to 21.2 yuan) under the pretext of increasing water supply. The tenants were all shocked and sent letters requesting that the order to increase the rent be withdrawn. The company ignored them all. The tenants then organized a Tenants' Association to seek a solution. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, they held an inaugural meeting, electing Wang Weichuan, Lu Jianyun, Wu Tingzhen, Jin Zhengjiang, Xu Yonglin, Zhang Xueshu, Wang Songtao, Fang A'ming, Chen Longbao, Ding Yongtai, Peng Debiao, Ge Laosi, Hu Junjie, Zheng Juenong, Diao Xiuzhang, Yu Afu, Yuan Xinchen, Lu Fengming, Bian Yongchao, Wang Fuzeng, Qi Huaizhang, and 21 others as executive committee members. They immediately took their oaths of office and chose to begin work tomorrow (i.e., today), assigning duties and submitting a report for the record.</p>

<p>Landlord Sues for Eviction</p>
<p>Tenants Refuse to Vacate</p>
<p>The houses of Qinglian Pavilion on Fourth Horse Road originally belonged to the New Sassoon Company. Last autumn, New Sassoon sold the property to the Sanyuan Real Estate Company. The 25-year lease agreement between Qinglian Pavilion and New Sassoon was about to expire, so Sanyuan notified Qinglian Pavilion that it should be vacated on the expiration date. However, the shops on the ground floor of Qinglian Pavilion are all subleased from Qinglian Pavilion and requested an extension, which Sanyuan refused. As a result, Qinglian Pavilion is in a difficult position, having to deal with the tenants and the landlord. Therefore, it retained lawyer Shen Yuesheng to file a lawsuit with the Special District Local Court, requesting a judgment ordering the tenants to vacate so that the house could be returned to the landlord. The landlord also retained a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Qinglian Pavilion for eviction. The Special Court held a preliminary hearing for mediation, but no agreement was reached, and a formal summons will be issued in the coming days.</p>

Recently, Shi Arong, the ringleader of the case, was captured and detained for interrogation. This has been reported in previous news. The trial continued yesterday morning. Qu Chengqing and Luo Zhu, the landlady of the two rooms at No. 1548, Runde Lane, Gongping Road, where the hostage was hidden, were summoned to court to testify. Qu first described the kidnapping, stating that on the night of January 11th, he was returning home from outside and had reached the entrance of his residence at No. 1760 Haining Road when six kidnappers suddenly arrived, two of them holding pistols. They forced him into a car prepared by the bandits and drove him to the bandit's den, where he was hidden upstairs. They immediately forced him to write a letter to his family, demanding 100,000 yuan ransom.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>He stayed for about a week and was rescued. He did not spend a penny. He did not know whether the defendant was the ringleader. Next, Luo Zhu testified that Shi Arong and another person had come to rent the upstairs room. Later, a woman and a child came to live with them. The woman was Shi's wife. It was said that Shi opened a car dealership on Dengtu Road. They lived there for about a week. The woman and child left, and Shi said that he had returned to his hometown. Later, the hostage was brought to my house, and I really didn't know, etc. When questioned, Shi Arong denied being a bandit.

<p>Yang Da, a man from Jiangbei in his twenties, lived in a thatched shed in the lane east of the Silk Factory on Singapore Road in western Shanghai. He was usually restless, resulting in feuds with others outside. On the night before last, Yang had already gone to bed when he was suddenly attacked by several enemies, armed with sharp knives and iron rods, who stabbed Yang's body and head more than ten times, killing him on the spot. After his death, the body was dragged outside the door, and an iron rod was tied to his body. The murderers fled the scene. When the Sixth District Police Station learned of this, they ordered an arrest, but were unsuccessful. Yesterday, they ordered Tan Hefu, the head of the 89th Tu, to report the matter to the Local Court. Prosecutor Wang and other inspectors were commissioned to inspect the scene and confirmed that he had been killed. The family was ordered to collect the body and await the arrest of the murderers. The iron rod was taken to the court for storage.</p>

Yesterday, they were summoned again, and the defendants all complied with the order to appear in court to await instructions. However, the plaintiffs and their lawyers suddenly failed to appear in court, only sending a letter requesting a postponement. The lawyers representing the defendants, Lin Yingqing and Wang Yintai, stated that the defendants had all complied with the order to appear in court, but the plaintiffs had not appeared. They requested permission to proceed with a unilateral defense, etc. Judge Gong ordered a postponement of seven days to summon the plaintiffs to court for verification.</p>

<p>Related to Marital Discord and Economic Pressure</p>
<p>On the 19th of this month, a traveler came to the Yingbin Hotel in Qinghe Lane, Zhejiang Road, claiming to be surnamed Zheng, named Wenpin, from Ningbo, and coming from Hankou. He stayed in room 214. Around 9:00 PM the night before last, he suddenly committed suicide by ingesting opium in his room. He was discovered and rushed to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was too late. He died in the hospital at 2:00 AM yesterday morning. According to those who knew Zheng, his actions were due to both marital discord and economic pressure. Zheng was 27 years old and worked at the Yihe Tai Wood Shop at the racecourse entrance in the Special District of Hankou. Recently, he was engaged to Guo Yulian of the Zheng Shunfeng Wood Shop through the introduction of a friend. However, the woman's mother disapproved of the marriage because Zheng had no permanent property and was far away in another province, and she instructed her daughter to write a letter to Zheng, canceling the previous agreement. It is possible that this led to his rash decision, etc.</p>

He has special insights into the treatment of typhoid fever and various pediatric diseases. Dr. He said that recently the weather has been abnormal, and seasonal diseases are prevalent. There are many cases of meningitis and measles, especially among children. The methods of prevention include vaccination, paying attention to diet and temperature, and decocting one fresh reed root (with nodes removed), three qian of Chuzhou chrysanthemum, and seven water chestnuts daily as a tea substitute to avoid infection. Children are of pure yang constitution and tend to have internal heat and phlegm. Reed root can clear heat, Chuzhou chrysanthemum can soothe the liver and extinguish wind, and water chestnuts can dissolve phlegm and reduce stagnation. If there is no accumulation inside, seasonal evils will not be able to invade. Even if they are affected, the condition will be mild. Those who are already affected should still seek medical treatment. Dr. He is now willing to serve as a social medical consultant. If patients encounter difficult and complicated diseases, they can write to Dr. He's residence to discuss treatment methods, and he will provide detailed answers.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau received a lost boy named Ma Xiaolong yesterday, sent by the Second District. He claimed to be 14 years old, from Danyang, and living in Danyang Lingdi Fang. His father's name is Ma Sancheng, a mason. I came to Shanghai with my father three years ago to apprentice as a carpenter at the Dongyang Company Wharf. My master's name is Zhen Ming. Because I didn't want to apprentice at the carpenter shop, I secretly ran away last month and apprenticed at a porridge shop. Yesterday, I went out to play and lost my way, etc. The boy has a shaved head and is wearing a black cloth jacket and pants, a black cotton vest, patterned socks, and rubber overshoes. He was sent to the Women and Children Relief Association for care and a notice was placed in the newspaper to find his family.</p>

<p>Jiangnan College on Connaught Road, Jin Situ Temple Street, has been very crowded with students this semester. The students are all working very hard on extracurricular academic research. Several organizations, such as the Qingdao Society and the Social Science Research Association, have been established one after another. Recently, the Bell Society has been organized, with the pure purpose of studying social sciences, natural sciences, and literature and art. Therefore, many students have participated. The society held its inaugural meeting yesterday and elected Jin Caiqiao, Shao Rongjiu, Jiang Zixun, and 25 others as executive committee members, and Ying Yao and seven others as alternate executive committee members. They plan to publish a weekly publication and prepare to publish a special publication on academic research.

<p>— A Moment</p>
<p>It was as if in a dream, the fine rain outside the window gently tapping the leaves, a poetic clear sound filling the dark night. Suddenly, the sound of an iron rod hitting a stone, "jiji," startled me awake from my hazy memory. I lazily opened my sleepy eyes and saw that the dark house was suddenly filled with unexpected light. "Ah, isn't that the brilliance of a flashlight?" I muttered to myself.</p>
<p>Anyone would find it strange and shocking that someone would shine a flashlight outside the window and make the sound of iron tools at this late hour. A kind of inexplicable terror tightened around me. So I quickly put on my vest and got up.</p>
<p>"Min, wake up, wake up, something's happening..."</p>
<p>I asked Mr. Wu in the room, but my throat felt a little unnatural.</p>
<p>"What... what..." he asked in alarm.</p>
<p>"Didn't you hear the sound of an iron rod dragging outside just now?"</p>
<p>"What, an iron rod?"</p>
<p>"Yes, an iron rod, and a flashlight is shining everywhere. Get up and see what's going on."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid, Lao Zhang... just now in my dream I saw a bloody corpse in a wheat field. Tonight's unfortunate change may be a foreboding of my dream."</p>
<p>"What's there to be afraid of? We didn't kill anyone's parents. Get up, be brave."</p>
<p>Mr. Wu couldn't resist my urging, so he put on his coat. We each carried a kind of fearful and mysterious thought, waiting for something unfortunate to happen.</p>
<p>The darkness all around was a little frightening. All the sounds were swallowed by the god of night. Only the gentle breeze kissing the willow branches made a delicate whisper rippling in the lonely air. Mr. Wu and I searched around the dormitory in silence, peering as if looking for something precious.</p>
<p>"Look, isn't there a dark shadow approaching us in front?"</p>
<p>I said to Mr. Wu in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, so what do we do?" He seemed a little scared.</p>
<p>"We'll go forward and ask to find out what's going on."</p>
<p>"......................"</p>
<p>"Who?" It was the voices of the Misses asking, followed by the shining of a flashlight.</p>
<p>"Me, me," we quickly walked towards them.</p>
<p>"Miss Chen, Miss Wang... what are you looking for? It's so late," I asked.</p>
<p>"Quietly, Mr. Zhang, tonight there are troublemakers who want to burn us to death..."</p>
<p>"Last night we found a lot of straw and cotton paper soaked in kerosene. Tonight we found a lot too. If we don't sacrifice our sleep, maybe all the students will be burned to death by these ruthless troublemakers," Miss Chen was interrupted by Miss Li, who was usually good at eloquence, before she could finish speaking.</p>
<p>"So, where did you get this news?" I asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>"The other day, a few boxes of bees were placed next to your male dormitory, weren't they burned for no reason? At that time, we all went to dinner, so we didn't know who did it. Later, we heard that a few bad people wanted to burn down all the houses. Therefore, we all have to be careful and pay attention," Miss Chen said angrily.</p>
<p>"Just a few of you, aren't you afraid?" Mr. Wu said.</p>
<p>"What are we afraid of? What we're afraid of is not being able to see them! Those troublemakers," Miss Li said.</p>
<p>"You don't sleep all night? That's really too hard," I asked worriedly.</p>
<p>"We have to patrol all night, but in two shifts, one for the first half of the night and one for the second half of the night, with eight or nine people in each shift. You male students are the same," Miss Li replied.</p>
<p>"Okay, continue your work, but be careful of unexpected misfortunes."</p>
<p>"Thank you," they said as they went to do their work.</p>
<p>Each of them was very brave and patrolled everywhere. Some held wooden sticks, some held iron rods, and some held flashlights. The color on their faces was still rosy, without a trace of fear.</p>
