<p>時評</p>
<h3>怎樣體認田中奏摺（二）</h3>
<p>由於昨評所引證的湯麥斯蒙敎授論列「日本帝國主義」的說明。我們可以知道日本的「對外侵略」。││尤其是對我東北積極侵略。决不是如一般日帝國主義者的代言人所宣傳的。由於（一）人口過剩。（二）資源缺乏。至於目前一般日本軍閥政客宣稱。「滿蒙是日本的生存命脈」。「滿蒙是日本的國防重地」。更如大阪每日新聞社長本山彦一所宣稱。「滿蒙在地圖上宛如一枝手槍。正指日本腹部。即此一端。已足使日人夙夜匪懈。以注意該地之利益與安全」（見十月二十四日山本致美國經營二十五家新聞業的哈佛德氏一封信）等等。極其荒謬無理之怪論。在事實上適足以說明其爲蹂躙公理正義的惡魔。因爲「滿蒙」是中國的領土。既找不出一絲絲理由與日本的「生存」發生任何關聯。而硬指鄰國的領土爲己國的「國防重地」之行爲。更是公理與正義所絕不容有。至於說「滿蒙在地圖上如一枝手槍。正指日本腹地」。便搆成必須强佔「滿蒙」的理。由那末假如日本人一旦心血來潮。忽然感覺到「美國在地圖上如像一隻惡獸。張吻磨牙。對日迎面撲來」。或者忽然感覺到「蘇俄在地圖上眞如所謂「東方之熊。時時予日本以嚴重的威脅」日本也不將要「夙夜匪懈地注意該地之利益與安全」嗎。同時誠如日人所見。則我們亦可謂「日本在地圖上如像一條蠶。正沿着桑葉似的歐亞大陸之邊緣而囓食」。則在事實上立國於歐亞大陸的國家。亦將非共起而滅亡日本不可了。持某一種荒謬絕倫不成爲理由之理由。以企圖掩飾其野心與暴行。原爲一般野心家的慣技。固無足怪。不過在此我們應該切實認定的。即上述的怪論之種種。决不能搆成日本對外侵略以及特别的對我東北積極侵略的理由。尤不能認爲一種可以成立的對外侵略之原因。</p>
<p>我們要把握日本之所以對外侵略的原因。首先即應認清日本爲國際資本主義國家行列中之一員。日本自從明治維新以後。無形中日本的財閥如三井三菱諸「王國」。即取得了支配政治的實權。同時并推進日本脫離封建的廢墟。走上資本主義的道路。資本主義在其始初時期的口號。爲「自由競爭」。但繼之即蛻變而爲「壟斷」與「獨占」。其所呈現於事實者。在國内即爲壓倒一般中小企業。而形成托拉斯與新迪加等組織。壟斷資本。操縱金融。在國外則爲尋覓市塲。尋覓原料。尋覓投資地。開始與其他資本主義國家發生經濟上互爭雄長之角逐。更深植下毒害弱小民族之根基。迨資本主義逐漸發展至極嶺。而形成爲帝國主義。即具備極其兇殘之諸形相。其在國内即爲以暴力壓制反動勢力。更以「發揚國威」「伸張勢力」諸口號。朦蔽人民的耳目。俾甘心爲其效死。其在國外。則開始武力的角逐。與暴力的侵略。終至於在和平寗靜的世界裏捲起恐怖悲慘的黑潮。特别是日本。當她開始步上資本主義道路的時候。西方的資本主義已生長成熟。她一脫胎。便遇着了當頭勁敵。所以在其生長的初期。便帶着極其兇殘的形相。挾持軍國主義以武力問世界之鼎。與列强爭雄長。</p>
<p>在明治維新之初。日本的資本階級軍閥官僚與統治者定下了向外發展的海洋政策與大陸政策。即所謂「明治大帝的遺策」。清日日俄兩次大戰之發生。即所謂「明治大帝遺策」之執行。而琉球台灣韓國之吞併。亦正是「明治遺策」的第一步的成功。琉球與台灣併吞以後。已確立了海洋政策的基礎。此後即以全力着重於其大陸政策的實現。田中的對滿蒙積極政策的基礎。即建築於明治遺策之上。他是一貫的發展。一貫的推進。决不是偶然。决不是無緣無故。</p>
<p>日本的著名經濟學者高橋龜吉在「中日經濟關係與對華武斷政策」一文中曾說。「事實上日本帝國主義向來被世論非難。而依然不得不用武斷政策的老調子。以維持其一等國體面的根本理由。要之不外乎爲單用經濟力决不能期待其帝國主義的發展之結果」。又如日本的政論家鈴木茂三郎在「中國的日本國家資本及財閥資本聯合」一文中也曾說。「在中國第一是日本私娼。第二是高根嗎啡的密賣商。第三是三井物産會社的販賣員。都打着日本的國旗向中國内地猛進」。這種發言。充分地說明了日本以武力對外侵略的理由。更充分地證明了日帝國主義者對中國侵略之無孔不入。同時即正所以說明日本的軍閥官僚在怎樣積極的執行着「明治大帝的遺策」。</p>
<p>田中義一雖以對中國問題爲其生平的抱負。雖是一個野心軍閥。但决不如其與黨政友會所批評他的「田中的頭有些兒怪樣。做出常識所想不到的事情」。他只是明治遺策的忠實執行者。他只是一個反動的野心軍閥。滿蒙積極政策的奏摺之自田中而呈奏。亦自非偶然。</p>
<p>我們要明白體認了上述的說明。才能把握日帝國主義者所以對外侵略。以及田中奏摺之所以産生。同時我們才能體認田中奏摺的實質。才能體認田中危害世界的大陰謀。</p>

<h3>土肥到津任務</h3>
<p>（北平）　土肥原來津目的（一）慫恿溥儀、組織明光帝國、已失敗、（二）勾結魯晉等省失意軍人、擾亂治安、副張已分電各省當局特别注意、（三）策劃進攻錦州計畫、（四）陰謀擾亂天津·北平·張家口·唐山·製造恐怖現象、以作進兵口實、</p>
<h3>日機數架在三間房擲彈</h3>
<p>瀋日軍悉數向北滿推進</p>
<p>（南京）　外交界接北平九日電稱、八日早八時、日飛機數架、在黑省三間房我軍陣地、擲彈多枚、十時半日飛機一架赴黑省垣、環繞約半小時、又日方調駐鮮軍隊赴瀋、駐瀋軍悉數向北滿推進、其多數軍隊七日到江橋、仍有積極進窺黑垣勢、（九日專電）</p>
<p>（東京）　此間頃接訪員電報、謂馬占山業已宣戰、馬之軍隊與日兵前在嫩江交戰後退走、又據瀋陽訪電稱、馬占山已電請張學良調吉軍以助抗日之吉軍、以上消息、均未經官方徵實、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　據陸軍省今日所接之報告、滿洲時局又呈危機、聞華兵現集中於昻昻溪之南、其地距大興日兵線北二十哩左右、又聞華兵共有步兵五千六百人、騎兵二千四百人、又砲兵與工程兵三百人、而日兵則不足一千、洮南所有之生力兵爲數不多、因前所調往之援軍、本月六日已停止前進、而折回長春也、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>國聯將宣告日本違犯會章</h3>
<p>理事會有將日本除名權利</p>
<p>撤回駐使傳已有一度討論</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯中人對於日本退出國聯之恫嚇、聲稱、理事會十六日重開後、行將宣告日本違犯國聯會章、如此理事會便有投票將日本除名之權利、又對於日本認國聯企圖成爲「太上國家」之說、國聯中人鄭重聲稱、理事會關於遼吉爭執、迄今足以拘束會員國之措施、僅爲九月三十日之决議案、而日本對於該案親由芳澤投票贊成、又稱、日本現將要求中國對於幣原所提基本五點、予以書面同意、然後撤兵、足以證明日軍之駐在東三省、其用意不復在保護日僑、乃欲用武力佔領以代國聯會章所規定之和平方法、而迫中國讓步、是日本所處地位、不啻自認違背國聯會章與非戰公約及九國公約也云云、國聯總秘書德魯蒙所發關於中日糾紛之聲明、今日已引起此間之評論、以爲德氏之意見不生影響、因渠無投票權、僅在各理事間任傳達文書之役、各理事將自作主張也、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯行政會在下屆會議時對於滿洲問題將採何種行動、外間頗多推測</p>
<p>之詞、但路透社敢謂行政會將有何種决議、此間現絕對不知、如十一月十六日日軍迄不撤退、則重大警告將送交日本、此爲顯然之事、但行政會會員連白里安在内、今猶不知行政會將有何種决議也、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　此間官塲未聞撤回駐東京外國大使之建議、但承認各國都曾討論及此、今日國聯某要員告路透訪員、謂渠未能證實議長白里安與其他會員商榷撤回駐日大使之消息、近數日來、各處傳說議長與會員對於此事已互換意見、因日本抗不遵行行政會之决議也、據說行政會於十六日集會時、將决定撤回駐日外交代表、然後延會一星期或十天、以便視察此種警告之效力、如撤回駐使仍不能使日本改其態度、則行政會將再集議、而援用中國現據以請求之國聯會章第十一條、或會章第十五條、宣佈對日經濟絕交、美國之加入此種杯葛、須得其國會之同意、而國會刻尙在休會期中、須至十二月七日始開會也、以上撤回外交代表與對日經濟絕交之建議、尙屬一種空談目前時局緊迫、無怪種種傳說及猜測之詞隨之俱起、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　此間消息靈通之各方面、以爲國聯行政會關於滿洲問題、殊未必採行如撤回駐日大使之極端步驟、雖日内瓦理想派發出驚人謠言、但此種步驟之正式建議、並未提出、處理時局以前、有繼續互換意見之需要、但援用國聯會章第十六條所規定之懲戒等極端辦法、則未成問題、雖以法理言、戰事現已在滿洲進行、但中日兩國皆未提及懲戒之援用、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>日政府致白里安覆牒</h3>
<p>藉口修理江橋廻避挑戰責任</p>
<p>（東京）　日本政府對白里安六日關於嫩江事件對日通牒之回答、昨晨電送芳澤大使訓令傳達白里安、並於昨晚七時由外務省公表、其要旨如下、今次中日兩軍衝突原因、日軍小數部隊掩護工程師前往嫩江修理鐡橋、然駐屯嫩江北岸之黑龍江軍突然開槍、洮昻鐡路由滿鐡築成、於一九二七年交中國、然中國迄今未付經費、又不肯列入借欵之内、故該鐡路雖經交與中國、事實上可視爲滿鐡財産、且該線爲滿鐡培養線之一、駐齊齊哈爾日領事爲保護滿鐡利益起見、自十月中旬以來、對中國迭次交涉修理橋梁、然中國當局採遷延政策、不容日方要求、最近嫩江結氷期逼近、恐將有不能修理之懼、於是日軍决定掩護滿鐡工程師實行修橋、先爲避免衝突起見、由日領事及關東軍參謀要求黑省當局、將嫰江北岸黑軍後退十基羅米地點、然至十一月四日黑軍尙未撤退、及日軍至江橋附近、突然開始轟擊、日軍一時復退、俟援軍到來、六日正午擊退黑軍、今次日軍出動如上所述、其目的在於掩護修橋工作、然因華兵之不信行爲、遂不得不出於攻擊態度、陸軍中央當局已命軍司令官不再使軍事行動擴大矣云云、（九日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　日代表芳澤今日通知白里安、日軍在此時不能撤回滿鐡附屬地、芳澤係答復白里安最近一函、文中一再聲稱、日本因中國尙未能保證東三省境内法紀與秩序、故此時不能撤兵、（八日國民電）</p>
<h3>日政府將向國聯抗議</h3>
<p>認秘書處漸變中國宣傳局</p>
<p>（東京）　據可恃消息、日政府將訓令芳澤向國聯行政會議長白里安或向秘書長德魯蒙提出抗議、反對國聯漸變爲中國宣傳局、而散佈反日空氣之不美滿辦法、指國聯衛生局在華代表拉志曼博士與中國財政部長宋子文同居於上海歐亞無線電臺、而由該電臺時常以中國宣傳文字發致國聯、日本並責國聯秘書處不待證實其言、遽散佈中國之宣傳、日本又謂據可恃消息、拉志曼博士得前任國聯秘書華生之輔助、在數星期中已用去致國聯海電費、不下十二萬元、日本抗議書又將力斥國聯秘書處之不負責任的行爲、散佈列强或將撤回駐日外交代表之消息、抗議書並將聲明據日人觀之、國聯秘書處無權將華人於行政會休會時送交國聯之未證實報告散佈於外、因日本並未將不實不盡之駭人謠言報告國聯也、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>美日秘密外交</h3>
<p>勸告文件迄未公布</p>
<p>（東京）　日本關於滿案、願受國聯之勸告、而不能受國聯之指揮、今日東京政界與非政界似皆同具此情感、日本除已詆責國聯輕信中國之報告外、且因國聯秘書處現重視中日爭端之後果、而輕視中日爭端之起因、因是對於國聯惡感日深、故日本寗願退出國聯、而不願屈服國聯之命令、似已無疑、蓋日人視屈服關係其生存也、日本今對於所謂秘密外交、亦漸呈不安之象、而特别注意十一月五日駐日美國大使所遞與日外相之公文、該文内容、遵兩國間之諒解、未經公布、日本之覆文業已草就、大約將於今晚發出、其内容亦不公布、惟現信其性質多與十月二十九日覆白里安之文相同、政界對於此種秘密公文、殊不滿意、蓋恐引起外間驚人之謠言也、聞日政府有請美國准予公布之意、政界又謂秘密外交之行爲、殊有利於中國云、（九日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦英國彚聞報今晨社論謂、在令人迷混之報告中、有一事甚明顯者、即日本一面否認戰爭、一面實行戰爭是、吾人非謂中國理直、但日本繼續進行其目前方法、斯眞理曲耳云、顯有袒日色彩之晨郵報謂、國聯干涉能否眞正有助於和平主義、不能無疑云、每日快報稱、受過許多次數地震之國、不能爲日内瓦之雷聲所震動云、又每日郵報主張不與聞滿洲事、（九日路透社電）</p>
<h3>馬占山電告日軍侵境</h3>
<p>龍江馬占山通電云、各報館全國父老兄弟均鑒、遼吉變後、日人用種種方法、勾結土匪蒙匪、曁不良份子、圖謀北滿、以華人自立爲名、陰行其侵略土地政權之實、江省遠處邊圻、極力自衛、乃竟於江日起、公然出首、藉口修理嫩江江橋、以日兵掩護洮南張海鵬軍過江、壓迫我防地、開始攻擊、並於昨今兩日、日方利用飛機八架、砲二十餘門、猛烈環攻、勢非直搗江省省垣不可、復查嫩江江橋、係我國所有、日人何得干涉、占山原以此事國聯已有辦法、力主避免衝突、而日方不顧世界和平、始終貫澈其侵略滿蒙野心、江省處於必不得已地位、爲迫切自衛起見、已與武力周旋、大難當前、國將不國、惟有淬屬所部、誓死力抗、一切犧牲、在所不惜、務懇全國父老、努力振作、以救危亡、不勝憤激之至、代理黑龍江省政府主席馬占山叩魚印、（七日專電）</p>

<h3>國際商會銀專委會發表報告</h3>

<h3>日軍蹂躪遼東情形</h3>
<p>北平通信、遼寗省舊東邊道所屬、計有安東·新賓·通化·風城·寬甸·桓仁·臨江·輯安·長白·安圖·撫松·撫順·本溪·海龍·輝南·柳河·金縣·復縣·岫巖·莊河等二十縣、此次事變、除安東因交通便利、其消息尙時見關内各報外、其餘各縣、所有被暴日蹂躪情形、南北各報均少紀載、一若日軍對於遼寗東邊各縣、並無如何動作、實則皆因交通不便、消息閡隔、其遭逢暴日之殘殺、亦正不亞於瀋吉各地也、兹據新由山城子（東邊鎭守使駐在地）來平之某君談及、用爲介紹於下、（以下係某君談話）</p>
<p>「東邊範圍二十縣、物産豐富、幾爲全省之冠、如人參鹿茸大豆木材等、尤爲特産物之大宗、惟十餘年來、盜匪充斥、民不聊生、大好富區幾淪爲土匪世界、自民國十七年冬東北軍縮編後、東邊鎭守使于芷山率部駐彼、督隊痛勦、迄今三載、根株漸絕、著名匪區始成安樂鄕土、乃九一八事變突起、十九日午後、山城子始接到日軍佔據瀋陽長春之消息、居民陡聞此耗咸極恐慌、正談論間、而日飛機軋軋之聲、已由磬石（吉林屬）方面之上空飛來經朝陽鎭海龍向長春方面飛去、旋由鎭署以長途電話探詢、始悉在磬石縣市場投下重量炸彈五枚、炸死農工人三名、受傷者五名、在海龍投彈三枚、炸死警長一名、傷農民四名、並壞電話機一架、在朝陽鎭投彈三枚、均落空地、幸未傷人、並在磬石散下傳單、大意謂「日本此次出兵、確係中國破壞其南滿鐡路、不得已而爲自衛、爾商民勿得驚擾」等語、並其他種種挑撥離間之詞、二十一日下午後、得吉林失陷之報、於是從是日起日本飛機無日不沿瀋海吉海兩路線各重要城鎭、施行炸擊與偵察、無抵抗之平民、死亡於炸彈之下、據已知者、除上述磬石等縣外、計山城子炸斃農民四名、傷五名、清源縣炸死人民三名、傷五名、英格門炸死列車上之旅客一名、傷路警一名、並擊壞客車一輛、營盤街傷農人二名、烟筒山炸斃商民一名、傷三名、其他不知者、尙不知凡幾、十月二日午後、接山城子以西約七十里之興隆台村長電話、謂有匪兵連合之日軍千餘名、於午後二時到該村以西約十里之大孤家子宿營、搜掠民間自衛槍枝、捕去村長郭某、嚴刑拷訊後、即行槍斃、且活埋村民二人、因其有仇視韓民之嫌、且有次日該軍將向山城子前進之消息、各法團得此警耗、深恐于芷山鎭守使奉有不抵抗撤退之令、則該時日軍闌入、盜匪乘機而起、東邊將益不堪、當即以電話連合附近各城鎭、向各該地所駐日領詢問、究竟日軍之來、目的安在、若係爲奪取地盤而來、則只有忍死聽其踐踏、若謂係保護日鮮僑民、則東邊各縣所屬之日鮮僑民生命及財産、從無不安全之危險、日軍若來、激起民衆之忿、或轉與僑民不利、經交涉再三、日領雖迭謂已能諒解、顧不肯向日軍擔保、阻止前進、三日晨、凡山城子鄰近各城鎭之紳士、由日領邀集於山城子車站、乘坐火車、赴山城子以西約四十里之草紙車站、擬勸阻</p>

<h3>接要聞</h3>
<p>由大孤家子東進之日軍乃同時接瀋海路局電話、謂步騎砲各種聯合之日軍、約千餘名、分乘三列車、並有鐡甲車一列在前掩護、今晨六時由瀋陽東進、頗有進窺山城子模樣、聲言係偵察由省東退之東北各軍行動、各紳士曁法團代表聞此警報、乃邀同日領先赴營盤勸阻、及抵營盤、由日領以電話探詢日軍已開到何處、旋得覆電謂已到前甸、遂請日領向日軍指揮官以電話接洽、證明日鮮僑民無何等危險、並約該指揮官在營盤車站會晤、當面聲明、日指揮官允不再東進、並電知由興隆台方面東進之部隊、同時退回、於是東邊各屬、得以苟安至今、顧日人煽惑各縣獨立之舉、則積極進行、撫順本溪各縣、已均設立維持會·安東亦然、且日軍曾三度派人請謁于芷山、要求率部退出、于均避未見面、現在日軍所以不敢積極行動者、並非有畏於于芷山、亦非有愛於東邊各屬之人民、據聞因日軍志在北滿、大軍多已北上、以爲區區東邊各縣、已成甕中之鱉、釜底之魚、得間再來、傳檄可定、故東邊各屬人民、尙將偷息一時云、」（十一日八日晨）</p>
<h3>瀋陽日軍暴力檢查郵電</h3>
<p>▲意在防暴行外洩▲但事實欲蓋彌彰</p>
<p>大美晚報云、日本軍事長官對於有關遼吉事件之新聞、檢查之嚴密、幾同於歐戰之時、本報已獲得切實證據、足以證明日人檢查之苛細、本報瀋陽通訊員所發電報、多有爲日人完全扣去者、其餘亦常被删削更改、往往失去原文本意、目下該處與外間通訊、電報概須假道東京、郵件亦須受嚴密檢查、例如上月二十五日瀋陽所發電報、兹得通訊員郵寄底稿、核對之下、已被檢查員删去一段、内稱、花旗銀行副買辦某華人往邊業銀行收欵四十萬、竟被日兵痛毆、並閉禁室内、最後由渠設法報告花旗經理、轉報美領事、向日領事抗議、始得釋出、又北寗路局簽給荷蘭公司建築葫蘆島海港經費之支票、邉業銀行亦受日軍事當道之命、不允兌付、日政府及日内瓦日代表雖宣稱中國官辦銀行及銀號、業已復業、但本莊將其置在嚴密限制之下、除個人帳項上極小限度外、實際上幾不能營業最近關東軍司令通告、竟授權軍人、於認爲有與日軍敵人交易嫌疑時、即可封閉、向來外商在此間交易、大半與中國政府機關有關係、日軍新定章程、業使商務停頓、外國銀行與商家莫不大受影響、聞美商已將此種情形、報告紐約芝加哥等處總行、請美國務院直接干涉云云、此外關於國際通訊社通訊員韓德與加里福尼亞大學敎授索夫曼在瀋陽站攝影被捕消息、内述美領事已提出正式抗議、因日領事及軍事當道曾聲稱、攝影可以允許、惟日前帕拉蒙影片公司代表欲拍製影片時、日人禁攝新聞片、僅允其在日本租界街道内攝製若干無關重要之影片等語、亦被日本檢查員删去、其檢查之苛濫、於此可見一斑、</p>

<p>▲中央黨部九日上午九時、中央黨部舉行第一三七次總理紀念週、到蔣中正·張繼·何應欽·朱培德·劉文島·丁惟汾·朱家驊·葉楚傖·蔡元培·陳銘樞·吳鐡城·方覺慧·陳果夫·陳立夫·陳布雷·程天放·褚民誼·苗培成·恩克巴圖·黄實·孔祥熙·王桕齡·陳肇英·余井塘·及全體减員共六百餘人、由蔣中正主席、領導行禮後、張繼報告云、我們國家、現在當着這樣的難關、在總理紀念週時、我們在總理遺像之前、時時刻刻、都覺得對不住總理、如果總理還在世上、我們國家狠可以强盛、目前的難關、也可以有總理領導我們、安穏的渡過去、現在很不幸總理已不能親自領導我們了、我們遇到這樣的國家大難、同志間常常都想如何可以報答總理、繼承總理的遺志、秉承總理的遺敎、來渡過這個難關、兄弟個人相信國民黨有四十餘年的革命歷史、並且是總理一生歷盡艱苦所締造的、我們有這四十餘年的基礎、靠總理在天之靈、一定能團結一致、挽救這個國家的大難、我們大家祗要有自信力團結力、一定可以報答國民、一定可以無負四千年來的祖先、但是我們要救國、一定要認定我們的方針道路、尤其要認清世界上的大勢、我個人十餘年來常常注意中國與日本的關係、中國國民黨與日本的關係、我覺得一方面中日同文同種、照理應成兄弟之邦、一方面總理一生煞費苦心、想促起日本的覺悟、由中國和日本提携、以維繫東亞的和平、發揚東亞的文明、可是總理這一番苦心和努力、結果祇等於零、此其咎並不在中國、並不在中國國民黨、而在日本、尤其是日本的軍閥、日本自維新革命後、因爲軍事上稍爲得了一點勝利、就走到錯誤的路上去、日本的軍閥非常專横跋扈、亞洲便形成不穏的局面、在歐洲大國小國不同文不同種、尙且能共存共榮、而日本則時時刻刻滅絕國際道德、祇求獨存獨榮、不顧世上的公理、一面用强權肆行其吞併、琉球是一個美麗的小島、在中國保護之下、本極平安、可是日本非把他吞併不可、台灣亦蹈同樣的覆轍、高麗有二千年獨立的歷史、中國一向承認他獨立的地位、可是日本也把他滅亡了、像這樣的情形、日本如何能說是文明的國家、遵守國際道德的國家呢、這次東三省問題發生、日本又走上錯誤的途徑、所以日本過去的行爲、都是錯誤的、是中古時代侵略的行爲、我常常到日本去、對日本人指出他們的錯誤、由十餘年來的觀察、知道日本雖不乏明瞭大勢之士、但是覺悟的分子終敵不過日本軍閥的傳統勢力、常常覺得日本若不改正其迷妄的心理、將終爲世界和平之障礙、這次日軍侵佔我東省、可算把他們的横暴發揮無遺了、我們中國受了這樣重大的侮辱、爲保障民族的生存和公理、除却以必死的决心、團結一致、作到底不懈之奮鬥、此外更没有出路、十八世紀的末葉、到十九世紀的初葉、拿破倫侵略德國、德國人民受法國的蹂躪以後、他們的民族所抱的態度、是怎樣呢、一八七零年、普法戰後、德國奪回亞爾薩斯勞倫二洲兵臨巴黎、作城下之盟、法國從這時候起、直到一九一四年、這四十四年中、法國國民所抱的精神、又是怎樣呢、歐西各國既有這樣良好的先例、擺在他們面前、我們就應該效法他們的精神、來應付國難中國是世界上最愛和平的民族、也是不惜犠牲一切、以支持公理的民族、所以我們在世界上無所謂親仇友敵、凡是能尊崇公理的國家、我們都可以認爲友國、這幾年來我們自身發生了一個錯誤、就是我們祇高喊打倒一切帝國主義、而没有能刻苦努力、奮發自强、以表示我們民族的力量、於是日本人遂在這個時候、以爲有機可乘、而大肆其强暴、現在國際聯合會及各友邦已覺得擁護公理保障世界和平、實爲世界與我們中國共同的責任、世界各國對於我們擁護公理抵禦强暴的精神、已有十分的認識、我們對於這世界上不良的份子不良的民族、應該糾正他懲戒他、這才不負現代世界的意義、我們的民族自己也要有意義、要團結一致、表現四萬萬中國人是一個整個的民族、發揮我們的力量、但是所謂四萬萬人團結起來、是一句空洞的話、最要緊的是我們領導人民的國民黨、要抱定無上的犧牲、團結起來、然後才能領導人民、在世界上爭我們的地位、才能得到國際間援助、然後横行無道的國家就不怕他不屈服不低頭了、報告畢散會、</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>▲左寳貴陣亡之壯烈</p>
<p>平壤之役。左寳貴以一軍當敵之全師。獨守西門。（左以記名提督黄馬褂雙眼花翎雙號巴圖魯屈居葉志超下）其時衛汝貴先遁。葉亦繼遁。聶功亭且戰且退。喪失有限。左聞之髮竪皆裂。揮紅旗親自督戰。日軍四面環攻。彈如雨下。左之雙眼花翎。均爲砲彈燃燒。祗剩翎梗。猶自燃燒砲轟敵。斃日軍數百人。苦戰一日夜。部下喪亡者逾半。某弁力勸左退。以圖再舉。左拔佩刀割衣裾以窖於衆曰。今日之事。有退者當如此裾。回顧部下祗餘三百餘人。而敵彈飛至中左臂。左不爲動。裏創再戰。一馬當先。雙手刄日酋數十人。敵軍愈聚愈衆。左瞋目大呼。陷陣而入腹背受彈創。馬斃而左亦倒。部下士憤怒之下。莫不以一當百。彈罄而全軍遂覆。逃歸祗四五人。述其陣亡時之慘烈。聞者莫不爲之淚下。可與海軍中鄧世昌後先媲美矣。哀哉。</p>
<p>不除庭艸齊夫談薈</p>
<h3>午飯棹上</h3>
<p>你學佛嗎？爲何不吃肉？</p>
<p>我没有發明，不能勞働，對於社會毫無貢獻，做個蛀米蟲，已是慚愧萬分：如果再要吃葷，傷他生命，養我這個廢人，那更是說不去了。</p>
<p>照你進樣說，我們這些人，都不該吃葷了。誰有發明？誰能勞働？誰配牛肉？</p>
<p>對！我們這些飯桶，簡直没有一個不該吃素：配吃葷的恐怕只有挑水燒飯的閔媽！</p>
<p>好！我們把葷菜一起給了閔媽吃吧！</p>
<p>抱孩子的金媽配不配吃葷呢？閔媽旣有肉吃，金媽似乎不可偏枯。</p>
<p>這要看金媽是爲誰抱孩子。如果孩子的母親是一位科學實騐室裏的工作者，或是一位紗廠裏的女工，那麽金媽抱這孩子是帮助人發明或勞働，她便配受我們的禮物。若是孩子的母親雇金媽來抱孩子爲的是自己要出去打牌或在家裏貪圖舒服，那末金媽便是帮閑不是帮忙，她之不配吃葷也如同我們一樣。</p>
<p>你說勞働者配吃葷，在這不平等的社會中偏偏是勞働者買不起葷菜吃。</p>
<p>只要高等游民，書獃子，老爺，太太，小姐，流氓及一切不能發明不會勞働的人只許吃素：那麽，他們自然是有葷可吃了。</p>
<p>這也不澈底！發明，勞働是個人對人類的貢獻，於畜類有何關係？一定要拿牛，羊，猪，鷄，鴨，魚的生命來報答他們的功勞，也不見得公平。</p>
<p>好，𠴰們一起吃素吧！</p>
<h3>平望之禦倭敵樓</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>平望。吳江縣屬之小鎭也。離城約四十餘里。附近鶯脰湖。尤爲名勝之區。曩年買舟游餘杭。過此適爲薄暮。烟水迷茫。未能辨識。前歲有事赴梨花里。歸途由梨里至平望。然後由平望乘輪舟至嘉禾。蓋梨里距平望。祇水程十有二里耳。以候舟故。登埠勾留一小時許。得以領略其地景物。市街絕短。居民大都質樸無華。惟多蘭若。迷信神權之盛。於此可觀。地旣濱水。乃富魚蝦菱芡之利。并聞某橋下産紅蝦一種。色赮蟒鬚。異於常類。過橋則否。相傳爲仙家烹蝦佐酒。酕醄而吐橋下。遂化爲異種。荒誕之談。不足信也。明嘉靖間。第倭冦犯我邊境。民牧楊芷憂之。因鳩工築敵樓於長老橋之北。及冦擾平望。楊芷親率土卒。登敵樓以禦之。矢石俱下。殲倭將松村吉士。餘冦紛下舳艫。揚帆而遁。楊芷追之。覆舳艫無數。倭寇之氣。爲之大挫。時代變遷。敵樓漸傾圯。今祇留石基數丈。銅駝荆棘。不必過洛陽宫門。亦自興感喟也。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>第一輛汽車汽車的歷史。也差不多有百年之久了。最近奥大利曾舉行第一輛汽車的創造者百年祭。這創造者名西格佛來馬格司。Siegfried　Marcus一般中歐洲的朋友們。都說他實在是創造汽車的第一功臣。他的第一輛汽車在一千八百六十四年間造成。那時是用油的。草創之初。當然諸多不完備。他又下了一番研究工夫。大加改良。便在一千八百七十五年間造成了一輛較好的汽車。此車至今尙保存在首都維也納城中。以資觀感。不過馬格司氏的車子。對於機械方面多所欠缺。不能自己推進。在一百二十八年以前。便有一位英國的發明家德來維昔R.Trevithick氏造成了一輛蒸汽的車子。·駛行於倫敦的街道中。曾有好多的時期。這蒸汽車大大的風行。和火車作劇烈的競爭。現代世界各處幾乎都可以看見汽車。而推源其始。却不得不歸功於馬格司與德來維昔。</p>
<h3>吳佩孚近訊</h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>以武力統一迷夢之吳子玉將軍。一蹶於榆關。二敗於武漢。蟄居四川已經數載。托庇於川中將領楊森鄧錫侯之籬下。久不爲世人所憶及矣。近日以暴日横行。奪我東北。殺我同胞。毁我建設。凡稍有熱血者莫不憤恨塡胸。於是亟須謀國内之團合。共禦外侮。與夫集中外交軍事人才。同心協力。以謀救國家於驚浪駭濤之中。遂有起用吳之傳說。而道路遼遠。吳之近訊。雖報紙中偶有發現。然終不能知其詳情也。一昨有客自陜至。陜與川爲近隣。言吳狀甚詳。謂吳久蟄於川中。其雄心固未嘗一日稍息。祇以時機未至耳。八月間。甘肅政變。主席馬鴻賓。被雷中田馬文車所拘。甘中政權。遂集中於雷馬之手。雷復出師攻隴南馬廷賢部。冀繳馬部之械。以充實力。馬不敵而退。集於川邊。知吳之聲望甚著。欲集吳以號召。乃遣使迎吳。吳以爲即此時機。可以調停甘局。即至武都。以安國軍總司令之名義。調解馬雷之爭。一方則聯合川中鄧錫侯楊森爲後盾。惟甘中將領。除雷中田外。尙有魯大昌陳璋珪二師。皆實力濃厚。聽命於西北行營主任楊虎城氏。雷之不敢公然反抗中央。亦以魯陳二師。誠服於楊之故。吳旣未受有中央命令。自不能謂之正式。魯陳即擯吳使不加可否。於是吳不能即至蘭州。祇令白堅武往說青海馬麟及雷魯陳等。不必以武力相見。各謀妥協條件。然迄今尙未得相當眉目。故吳方止於武都。未曾入蘭州也。吳之部下。星散已盡。此次至武都者。只白堅武所率之衛隊六百餘人。此六百餘人。自吳入川迄今。未嘗須臾離。蓋與吳同甘苦者也。</p>
<h3>抗日救國應有的認識</h3>
<p>— 恩溥</p>
<p>（一）抗日救國是含辛茹苦的重任。决不是時髦的舉動。</p>
<p>（二）抗日救國是正大光明刻不容緩的自衛義舉。决非排外尋釁鬼鬼祟祟的小人行爲。</p>
<p>（三）抗日救國是我個人的天職。當以身作則。爲他人先導。</p>
<p>（四）勸人抗日救國。是我個人的本分。人家不聽是人家的過失。我决不能因人家不聽。就停止我勸告的工作。</p>
<p>（五）人家不抗日救國。是他們的罪過。我旣認抗日救國爲正當行爲。决不能因他們的罪過而灰心停止我工作的進行。</p>
<p>（六）指敎他人抗日救或的方法。是至高無上的公德。救人脫離水火的善舉。</p>
<p>（七）求人指敎抗日救國的方法。是集思廣益的妙計。報仇雪恥的至善之法。决非我不如人甘心示弱的表示。</p>
<p>（八）陽奉陰違的抗日救國。是自殺的政策。貽笑外邦的大醜劇。</p>
<p>（九）抗日救國。要有久遠而忍耐的毅力。五分鐘的熱度是徒然的。</p>
<p>（十）抗日救國要有大無畏的精神。任何外力壓不倒我内心的抗日救國。</p>
<p>（十一）抵制日貨與之不合作。是最和平最容易最有效的抗日救國法。</p>
<p>（十二）行徵兵制以鍜鍊體格。行强迫職業敎育。以普及民衆敎育。是無上的救國業策。</p>
<h3>我之企業談（上）</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>近兩月來。企業家欲謀救國。作利人利己之圖。囑爲籌劃設計者。可謂盛極一時。但栩以爲不論何種事業。若其資本有限。往往中途竭蹶。一仆不起。實至危險。例如以數千資本爲小工業。製成一物。並不爲難。欲其銷行於市。則要件有三。第一。當使買主便宜。隨處可買。則必廣托分銷。假如每一分銷之處。放給帳面爲五十元。其成本爲百分之七十。則至少百家。已需三千五百元矣。第二。欲使買主知其貨物何處有售。即非廣告不可。假定爲二十短行。每行四角半。即需九元一日。申新兩報。隔日一刋。已需二百七十元之月費。至少非備五百元不可。第三。存貨存料。若不充足。則供不應求。實爲一大打擊。譬之於戰。而子彈不充。則進不能攻。退不能守。其敗必矣。故有五千元之貨帳在外。必備五千元之貨料在内。以供立時需要。庶能周轉循環。不致錯過時機。如上所述。即其基金至少已需一萬元。其廣告費從售價百分之五提出。即非月銷萬元之貨不可。夫以一萬資本。而欲做十二萬一年之生意。除非販賣商店。前門應客。後門進貨。長袖善舞者。或尙可能。名爲工廠。則斷斷乎不能。蓋工廠資本。至少三副。一在賬面。一在手上。一在棧房及途中耳。故以萬元資本而論。不過能做二萬一年之營業。以三分利計之。不過六千。内以三千爲廣告費。僅餘三千。是否足以開支。要不待夫蓍蔡而後知也。故栩本其爲謀必忠之旨。竊敢貢獻一言。凡欲以數千金爲小工業者。與其爲獨角戲。處處捉襟見肘。不如集合組織而爲公司股東。較爲穏健。例如組織十萬元之公司。其概算仍如上述。則分銷店可得千家。而存貨存料。亦備千家之需。但其廣告費仍不過三千。既有一千家之分銷。即其銷路必廣十倍。而生産力亦增十倍。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>鄕下人又到上海（十二）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>那時鄕下人隨着三等車裏的客人，如潮水一般的從火車小門裏　　，擠了出去。他雖然强辯說那班軍樂隊是迎接新娘子，其實他也知道一定來迎接什麽闊人。的他想：做了闊人，到底威風。就是那一班吃喜酒朋友，│他們稱之爲軍隊的，│那一點架子，倒也搭得不差。</p>
<p>他也不去追究那班兵是來接種秧委員呢？還是來接揀菜員呢？跟跟蹌蹌的走出了火車站，先要定一定方針，現在到那裏去？</p>
<p>他有一位外甥，在上海是有職業的。那位外甥姓林，大家都呌他阿木林。這是有許多朋友給他開玩笑呌出來的。上海地方，最容易給人題綽號。眞是一傳十·十傳百，你也呌，我也呌，到了以後，使得本人也無從否認了。其實上海以「阿」字稱呼人的，也不足爲奇。似阿德哥，阿林哥，李阿桂，張阿根之類，也數見不鮮。</p>
<p>「娘舅！你到上海來尋我好了，就住在我那裏，也不要緊。」他的外甥到鄕下去的當兒，給他說過那樣的話。</p>
<p>「我不認得你那個地方咧，上海新興的那種馬路，抝嘴抝舌，敎人記都不好記。什麽油抹布路，濕布衫路，還有馬浪蕩路，比了讀外國書還煩難。」鄕下人如此說。</p>
<p>「我住的地方最好記。有一位唱戲的梅蘭芳，你總曉得的嗎？」</p>
<p>「怎麽不曉得！那是三歲小孩子也都曉得。我還看見過他的照片咧。」鄕下人又充老内行。</p>
<p>「那末我告訴你！我住的地方，喚做梅蘭坊。上海的弄堂房子，都是什麽坊，什麽里的。梅蘭坊和梅蘭芳，聲音相同，不過一個坊字，和一個芳字寫法不同，可是到了法租界要問梅蘭坊，就容易問到。不瞞你說，我本派在福芝坊看弄堂的，說出福芝坊來，有些人便不大知道，梅蘭坊就容易記得了。」</p>
<p>「你不用叮囑，梅蘭芳的事，我都知道，伊現在正央人做媒咧。」</p>
<p>「怎麽敎人做媒？我倒没有曉得。」</p>
<p>「可不是，伊已經出了八字。」</p>
<p>「哈哈！恐怕你老人家又弄差了，他是新近得了博士，不是出了八字。」</p>

<h3>粉價暴落四五分</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、一致呈暴落之象、以洋麥報價亦見微小、而衝動最力者則爲金價之大落、當月前之高漲、基於洋麥之暴騰、目下與當時之金價、已落一百兩左右、匯率之放長、亦爲事實所必至、如是反變、即無異洋麥之仍可續定、况乎市塲又傳某廠已定成二船、價尙守秘密、復以天津日浪人之暴動、又連帶此後銷路之阻滯、故開盤迄收盤、人心始終不穏、陸續慘跌、觀察後步、彷彿尙凶多吉少也、結果本月份較前週收價暴跌四分半、十二月份跌五分、一月份跌三分七厘半、二月份跌三分半、三四月份跌二分七厘半云、</p>
<h3>小麥浮空猛抛</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面均見暴落、以洋麥報價旣亦微落、金市開價、又驟落二三十兩、國外匯兌、亦步步放長、人心異常虚軟、蓋一般人均恐懼匯率之長、洋麥勢須再來、因此大户多頭、及臨時浮空、抛售甚猛、市氣遂見傾瀉、計近期跌七八分、遠期落五六分、迨至下午開盤又較落三四分、惟中途謠傳英國向美洲購巨量小麥、或者洋麥須重入漲途、人心一激、近期遂回漲五六分、結果本月份較前週跌五分、十二月份跌五分、一月份跌六分、二月份跌五分、三月份跌四分、四月份跌六分云、</p>

<p>▲江海日輪留十八艘</p>
<p>抵制以來、江海各路、日船全停、即有行駛者、亦無營業、各路貨多船少、英輪乘機而起、九十兩月、太古·怡和·獲利各一二百萬不等、自上月由國輪招商三北等局、呈請總部放船復業以來、今已陸續還滬、相繼開班、至今日江海各線國輪已可全行、兹將航運近狀、分别查誌如下、</p>
<p>▲上下江輪全開長江華輪、在十月下旬放回招商·三北、係陸續復班者、至今在滬漢一線内祇有江裕·甬興·江天·三船、由交通處繼續租用、其餘全已交還各輪局、故長江班中業有江安·江順·新江·江華·江靖·江大·建國·新寗·長興·德興·伏龍·及長安·寗紹·等船開班、而上游航路内、刻因快利·峩嵋·富陽·等放歸、故宜昌班·長沙班·以及重慶班、均皆在開班中、而行駛者有廣濟·利濟·鴻元·鴻亨·鴻利·鴻貞以及吳興·等十餘艘、招商局更以擴充上江航業計、兹又新添大號拖駁兩艘、派入湖南一路中、刻下上下江之中國江輪、已有二十六艘開班矣、</p>

<h3>救國要民衆起來！</h3>
<p>怡音</p>
<p>拿破崙說、「我不怕在百萬兵將之前、惟怕在百萬民衆之前、我就東手無策了、」可知民衆的力量、是非同小可的可是我們中國的民衆、客氣的說、是愛好和平的民族、不客氣的說、是柔弱無用的民族、要不是的話、在此奇恥大辱空前未有的國難聲中、怎麽還聽不到大多數民衆的呼聲呢、這個原因、一方面、當然民衆們没有相當的知識、他方面是那些呼喊救或的志士、死不肯跑到平民隊伍中去、因此大城市裡閙得轟轟烈烈的救國工作、鄕間的民衆、還不知道是怎麽的一回事、我國以農立國、大多數的民衆、都是散居窮荒僻野的鄕村、他們是睡在鼓裏一般的、他們是没有直接受到苦痛的人、仍是過着他們「日出而作·日入而息·」的生活、所以我們要想有整個抗日救國的實力、第一就要到平民隊伍中、去做喚醒民衆的工作、拿破崙說「東北有箇巨人、他現在是睡着、但是不要使他醒來、要是他醒來、他就會像獅子一樣地强起來、」可知我們的民衆、眞箇一旦大家醒來、不但使日本恐懼、就是世界各國也要恐懼、所以喚醒民衆、是今後强盛最重要的事、第二要領導民衆、現在民衆是不全是有知識的、所以較有知識的人、應負責領導民衆、喊他怎樣去救國、在同一合理的步驟上走、第三便是團結民衆、外人謂我們民族如散沙一般、但是我們今後要免去這箇弊病、使四萬萬的散沙、變成一塊大石、那末我們的力量、足夠應用了、立國的要素第一是人民、所以要使有國的存在、必定隨時隨地不要忘記了民衆、我相信只有民衆自身起來、才能報仇雪恥、若是依賴他人、勢必永陷於水深火熱、不能自拔的地位、同胞們、起來罷、惟有我們自己起來才能解除我們的鎖鍊。</p>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>苗斯河東面的戰事什麽樣呢、</p>
<p>十月八日至十日、法軍第十七聯隊、以兩師美軍（第三十三和二十九師）爲聲援、沿着苗斯河右岸作戰、美軍主力則在左岸進攻、激戰後始進至西夫里巴蒙綫、此後美軍進攻即遇着敵軍的頑抗、遂覺兵力不足破敵、敵軍似已决心固守苗斯河右岸、蓋非此無以掩護右翼和中路敗軍的退却也、</p>
<p>爲打破敵軍這個計劃起見、聯軍總司令遂决定一面沿摩斯爾河兩岸向盧森堡方面進攻、一面沿塞爾河兩岸作戰、</p>
<p>十月二十日我把下面的訓令送交貝當司令、</p>
<p>現在作戰計劃注重把敵軍擊退至苗斯河斯敦尼以下、要攻破苗斯河敵軍的防綫須在莫斯爾河東西倆面準備向蘆森堡和塞爾方面進攻、</p>
<p>守在防綫的敵軍、苗斯河之西有一百二十七帥、苗斯河之東不過三十二師、所以進攻後勝利如何敏疾、須視佈置如何敏疾而定、</p>
<p>敵軍從美齊歐到塞塘的主要横貫鐡路綫失落之後、我軍的勝利更有把握、所以我軍陣綫縮短後抽調下來的法軍應即開往莫斯爾河東西兩面的勞倫前綫、因爲那方面我軍實力和地勢均利於速戰、</p>
<p>至於向苗斯河左岸前進的美軍隊伍如何調用參戰、亦當研究、</p>
<p>法軍總司令部情報處偵悉亞屯兩面的德軍兵力並不平均、一朝希爾遜和美齊歐間的鐡路綫失守則德軍最高司令更無恢復這平均的希望、所以我軍决定在莫斯爾方面進攻更有理由、這方面的進攻並非襲擊、因這方面敵軍駐防已久、深知我軍遲早終有進攻的一日、</p>
<p>我早在九月二十日就同德第八軍軍長（裘賴德將軍）談及此事、貝當司令在一月前也已通知加特諾司令佈置本部集團會攻、</p>
<p>十月二十一日、法軍總司令把勞倫方面總攻的計劃書送給我、這計劃書大致不差、惟於敏疾施行上稍有問題、尤其是關於莫斯爾河之西的作戰計劃、不能利用敵軍的弱點乘機速戰、莫斯爾河之東情形稍佳、我决定先在那方面立即調用所有的兵力作戰、</p>
<p>我先把進攻蘆森堡的計劃暫時放棄、並把原來計劃的範圍加以限制、但我爲軍事的立塲起見、仍想用少數兵力攻破四年來敵軍所佈置的防區、更爲精神的立塲起見想希望首先攻入敵國境内、</p>
<p>我因請貝當司令準備向聖亞夫爾塞爾布魯克方面進攻、十月二十五日、他向我報告、這次進攻約在十一月十五日左右開始、所須的大隊兵力的來源他也向我說明、</p>
<p>二十七日、他爲東部集團軍司令加特諾指定、進攻的部隊和進攻的目標、担任進攻的兵力爲第八（軍長裘賴德）和第十（軍長孟琴兩軍、第八軍已開到前綫、第十軍須從愛斯南河綫向東移動、配置在美第二軍與法第八軍之間、步兵二十師（其間美軍四五師）、野砲兵十至十二團、重砲一百八十至二百門、輕便坦克三團、中等坦克二隊、騎兵一聯隊、空軍一隊、爲作戰部隊、貝當司令在軍令裏面說明這並不是要向敵軍防綫直攻不懈、不過是用作一種策略而已、</p>
<p>法軍總司令要幾師美軍歸他支配、美軍第二軍指定掩護梅慈、（未完）</p>

<h3>小東道</h3>
<p>— 高桑</p>
<p>││贏的是曁南打勝諾森堡││</p>
<p>校裏體育部出了佈告、今天足球隊有與諾森堡開戰之訊、兩雄相遇、必有一番惡戰、</p>
<p>於是、在課堂裏都不想聽課了、本校雖則是足球鐡軍的大本營、但平素却很少看見他們的沙塲功績、一旦正式開火、自然格外情切、你約我、我約你、全校空氣大緊張、</p>
<p>在這樣一個情緒緊張之下、王君却偏偏要和我做點小東道、王君是半球迷、他說曁南靠不住、誰又病了、誰又不讀了、十分終有七分輸、本來我是不管、勝負終有結果、而因爲王君這樣豫言、索性就還他一個不相信、更進而說曁南一定贏、於是這爭執一開、二毛錢的東道纔定、並請了周君作證、免得到後一懶了事、</p>
<p>訂約是在上午、球賽在下午、爲了兩毛錢、倒賺了周君不少警告、他說、誰輸了、不拿出來、他必聯合武力解决、大有國聯大砲之概、但他亦太不公平、只是好像對我說、「難道曁南一定輸的嗎、」我心裏這樣想、只望曁南一贏、向他們報復、</p>
<p>果然下午到了、但還要上課、夾了幾斤重的洋裝書、便不免要文雅起來、走進課堂、看看同學們都有不耐煩的樣子、但時間未到、又不願空自犧牲、胖子先生來了、靜默、記筆記、今年反日缺了課、趕上去、我的筆頭是向着紙上寫、但今天的失落奇多、一句過去了、追不上、看看鄰座同學有未記好、剛一看、又一句過去了、這樣便只得留他去、愈記愈不成樣、</p>
<p>好在下課了、二毛錢倒還小事、氣却不願受、書都來不及送到房問裏、跑到球塲、人太多、擠不上、轉了半個圈、王君周君在左角上占着一張凳、留着個位置給我想是爲了兩毛錢、我於是很高興地得了個居高臨下的局勢周君和王君看看我、不免又要氣悶、</p>
<p>北風吹號、樹葉蕭蕭、背後的風吹得很急、不時有落葉飛上頭髮、人頭擠擠、童子軍東攬西阻、頗像玩把戲的所謂帮帮塲子、每一公共汽車開到的時候、球迷拚命趕着、就如排山倒海、又如北風捲落葉、</p>
<p>開始了、諾森堡是英國皇家兵、個個身材高大、大有不可一世之概、曁南旣素稱鐡軍、戰士黄黑交雜、短小精幹、自有遠東雄氣、你一來、我一去、白軍漸漸變紅、黄軍漸漸翻白、鬥爭劇烈、</p>
<p>曁南踢逆風、球勢便自然而然老在腹地、王君周君和我的暗爭總算暫停、伸長着脖子、各打自己的主意、</p>
<p>不料一球打向曁南門、守門員並未抵抗、只是輕輕的把球一拂、好像講了句風凉話、球就老實不客氣進了門、於是全塲一聲嘆息、王周二君亦然、但我們相覩之間、他們却又微微一笑、我懂得他們的心事、</p>
<p>又來了、諾森堡球門也被曁南打破、全場一聲歡呼、王周二君亦然、但我們相覩之間、他們又微微一笑、我懂得他們的心事、</p>
<p>這樣曁南球門一再開放、三對一、白軍戰勝黄軍、上半時告終、全塲黯然、</p>
<p>王君的大砲開了、他以爲兩毛錢穏定到手、便和周君商議起來、怎樣去享受、周君說坐西園、一包瓜子大王、二杯咖啡、恰夠、王君同意、先申明輸的不能參加、我不理他們、錢在袋子裏、横豎强力來、逃之夭夭、已是天經地義、而同時球賽旣未完、他們也難於即下哀的美敦書、</p>
<p>十分鐘、一忽就過、曁南球員急先跑到上風去、豫備雪恥、北風又在呌、空氣緊張、</p>
<p>達蓋將軍一隻射入英軍、我們相對微笑、達蓋兩隻射入英軍、我們相對微笑、至兹、以爲兩毛錢大家贏不到、我在喜悅之中、正式報以白眼、周君說、「高君可以放心了、也用不到逃、」我說、「誰逃、」「兩毛錢輸不起嗎、」這是本分的硬、</p>
<p>達蓋將軍終於射進第三隻、全塲聲如雷鳴、王君把周君的帽子向空中一丢、以示慶祝、我却順手一接、向袋裏一塞、條件便在、但那時球賽仍未完、風雲變化不已、周君向王君交涉、爲何把他的帽子丢、王君問我討、我先說「小洋兩毛」、</p>
<p>完了、一陣歡迎聲、球迷搶車回去、奔向校外、曁南球員雖負傷纍纍、但笑容可掬、披衣歸房、</p>
<p>北風吹不繼、周君的光頭變了毛頭了、急需帽子、而我不給、王君默不言語、自認敗北、終於周君向他討到了這兩毛錢、並不交給我、而條件是有福共享、周君理了理髮、王君講今天的球經、同進西園、咖啡三杯、瓜子大王吃不成、各食牛肉一小方、周君因頭髮之亂、我雖把帽子還了他、他仍要求賠償損失、我說、「你這喫白食的、好像國際聯盟一樣、」</p>

<h3>The Tragic Bombardment of Tianjin by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Japanese troops incite plainclothes units to attack provincial government and other institutions; Tianjin police and military exert utmost effort in defense and have dispersed the plainclothes units. Yesterday, Japanese troops shockingly used heavy artillery to bombard Chinese territory. Consuls from five countries demanded that the Japanese side respect the Boxer Protocol. Arita notified the League of Nations that Japanese troops in the Northeast would not withdraw for the time being.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Collaborate with Bandits to Disrupt Tianjin's Security</h3>
<p>Plainclothes units repelled by military and police; Japanese troops force Wang Shuchang to withdraw his troops.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than forty artillery shells were fired. Japanese troops plan to pass through the Italian concession; conflict arises when Italian soldiers prevent them.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tianjin telegram at 6 AM on the 9th: Chinese police have completely defeated the Japanese plainclothes units. In order to clarify responsibility for the conflict, Wang Shuchang ordered a temporary retreat and simultaneously questioned the Japanese military commander, demanding to know the reason for requiring Chinese military and police to withdraw beyond 300 meters. At 6 AM on the 9th, Chinese troops, in order to avoid conflict, had withdrawn to a distance of more than 300 meters from the Japanese concession, as demanded by the Japanese military. However, after 6 AM, Japanese troops shockingly opened fire on the Chinese area with heavy artillery, firing more than twenty shells. Some shells exploded at the camp gate, and the French bridge has been destroyed, cutting off transportation between Henan and Hebei. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) From the afternoon of the 9th, Japanese troops in Tianjin continued to attack the Hebei area with heavy artillery, resulting in more than two hundred civilian casualties. Many stray bullets landed in Nankai University and the "Three No Zones" area. Very few staff members of the Beining Railway came to work. Other institutions have, in effect, ceased operations since this morning. Wang Shuchang and Zhang Xueming are still in Tianjin. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The provincial government was occupied by plainclothes units on the morning of the 9th, but they were subsequently repelled. At the same time, the plainclothes units at Zha Kou attacked to the front of the Public Security Bureau. Suddenly, they heard of the failure of those occupying the provincial government and retreated. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 5 AM, the Japanese consul protested to the Second Army Headquarters, saying that a Japanese platoon leader had been killed by Chinese soldiers, and requested that Chinese troops quickly withdraw 300 meters, otherwise Japanese troops would take appropriate defense measures. Wang Shuchang, for the sake of settling the matter and reassuring the people, ordered the security team to retreat 300 meters. Plainclothes units took the opportunity to retreat into the Japanese concession. At 6:30 AM, Japanese troops bombarded the Public Security Bureau at Zha Kou with heavy artillery, firing a total of more than forty shells. The first thirty or so shells were blanks, and the last ones were live ammunition. The roof of the Public Works Bureau was destroyed in the bombardment. Italian sailors witnessed the Japanese soldiers firing and are willing to testify. At 7 AM, the Japanese military commander telegraphed Lushun, urgently requesting warships to come to Tianjin to protect Japanese nationals and ordered reservists in Tianjin to organize within ten hours, and ordered the establishment of a field hospital in the Public Hall. After 8 AM, order was restored in the Chinese territory, but businesses and residents remained closed. Japanese soldiers erected electric fences at all road junctions on the Sino-Japanese border, and Japanese businesses and residents in the Japanese area also remained closed. At noon, the Japanese police station ordered all Japanese nationals in the concession to evacuate within ten hours. Reporters twice visited Mayor Zhang and once visited Chairman Wang. According to their discussions, it is not necessary for me to say who is manipulating and directing these rioters behind the scenes, as the facts are already very clear to us. I am doing my best to maintain the security of the city. Apart from the beat police, there are 1,800 security team members, all of whom have received more than ten years of military training. If the Japanese army does not secretly assist the rioters, I believe that even two or three thousand more plainclothes units would not be a match for the security team. In order to respect the Boxer Protocol, I will not deploy the army to maintain the security of the city unless absolutely necessary. There are currently more than 10,000 army troops outside the city, prepared for any eventuality. The city government's letter of protest to the Japanese consul was sent out at 5 PM. French concession businesses closed on the 9th, and the post office did not open. Two special trains transported 139 plainclothes units to Beiping in the afternoon and evening. In the afternoon, the city government issued a notice imposing martial law starting on the 9th. Anyone who causes disturbance will be arrested and executed. Gunfire has not stopped all day at Haiguang Temple and Zha Kou. More than 300 employees of the Second Telephone Bureau have run out of food. At 1 PM, Zhuang Xiao gathered 1,500 plainclothes units at the Haiguang Temple fort, commanded by a certain Yang, planning to launch a general attack on three routes on the evening of the 9th. Several residents of Fugui Village in the Chinese area were injured and killed. More than ten rickshaw pullers were killed on Nanma Road. Seven plainclothes units were killed in front of the Public Security Bureau. Casualties at Haiguang Temple are unknown. A Chinese constable at No. 68 in the Japanese concession was injured in the arm. A Chinese constable at No. 133 was hit by a stray bullet. Four plainclothes units were killed and more than ten were injured. Three Japanese soldiers were injured. One person died in front of the Dabeihotel, and one person was injured behind the four-sided clock. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tianjin telegram: The commander of the Japanese garrison army again sent representatives to see Wang Shuchang twice at 5:30 AM on the 9th, demanding that Chinese military and police withdraw beyond 300 meters from the Japanese concession before 6 AM. While the Japanese military representative and Wang Shuchang were arguing, several hundred plainclothes units rushed out of the Japanese concession and attacked the security police. Our authorities were unable to make the police retreat in practice and remained in a stalemate. All the troops stationed in Tianjin by various countries were dispatched due to the serious situation in Tianjin to protect the concessions of various countries. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tianjin rioters obtained pistols, rifles, and armored vehicles from within the Japanese concession, plotting to seize the provincial government, city government, and Public Security Bureau. Our military and police resisted with all their might and failed to succeed. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 11 PM last night, more than ten plainclothes units in Tianjin obtained firearms and ammunition from Haiguang Temple in the Japanese concession and opened fire on the police station in the Sixth District South, destroying shops and residences along the way, and killing many pedestrians. At the same time, machine guns were suddenly fired from the Japanese concession into Chinese territory. Many rioters were arrested on the spot. According to their confessions, they were bought off by Zhang Bi and Li Jichun for forty silver dollars each, and they were scheduled to start the uprising on the night of the 8th. There were Japanese inside directing the rioters. Our troops have been dispatched to suppress the rioters. The commander of the Japanese garrison sent a representative to visit Wang Shuchang, verbally requesting that Chinese military and police immediately withdraw beyond 300 meters. If they did not withdraw, the Japanese army would take free action. Wang sternly refused. At 1 AM, Wang Shuchang used the telephone to notify various consuls, requesting them to order the Japanese consul to expel the plainclothes units from the concession, otherwise the Japanese consul should be responsible for security. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese garrison team stationed in Beiping received an urgent telegram from the Tianjin garrison army stating that Japanese troops and Chinese troops were fighting at 11 PM on the 8th, and requesting that the Japanese troops stationed in Beiping immediately and closely protect the Japanese consulate and Japanese nationals, etc. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tianjin telegram: Suddenly, at 1 AM this morning, two Japanese soldiers led dozens of Chinese plainclothes units to the Second Branch of the First District Public Security Bureau, demanding that the Chinese police withdraw and the Japanese soldiers take over. The police refused. The Japanese soldiers ordered the plainclothes units to open fire. Then, Japanese soldiers in the Japanese concession commanded Chinese plainclothes rioters to attack the Chinese area in three routes: (1) Several hundred Japanese soldiers led two to three hundred Chinese rioters out of the Japanese concession at Zha Kou and attacked the Dahongqiao Public Security Bureau. Japanese troops opened fire in the concession and bombarded Dahongqiao, only retreating back to the Japanese concession at 9 AM this morning. (2) Dozens of Japanese soldiers led three to four hundred rioters, attempting to pass through the Italian concession and attack the Chinese area. Italian soldiers stopped them. The Japanese soldiers opened fire, and the Italian army retaliated with machine guns. The Japanese soldiers retreated and instead bombarded the Italian concession with small steel cannons. The gunfire only stopped at 7 AM this morning, and traffic was cut off. (3) More than two hundred Japanese soldiers led five to six hundred rioters, attacking from Haiguang Temple at 2 AM. The rioters fired machine guns indiscriminately. Chinese military and police resisted. At 7 AM, the Japanese troops retreated when they ran out of ammunition, but the rioters had been surrounded by Chinese military and police. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tianjin rioters have withdrawn from Special District Two. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhou Dawen and Huang Xiansheng of the Liaoning Provincial Committee arrived in Beiping from Tianjin this afternoon. They claimed that the sound of artillery fire in Tianjin had not ceased this morning. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The chaotic situation in Tianjin has not abated slightly as of this afternoon. Telegrams and telephones between Beiping and Tianjin are still working, but telephones are mostly used by officials. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tonight, electric fences on the roads at the Sino-Japanese border were electrified by Japanese soldiers. All the lights inside the Japanese concession were turned off. Reservists were fully mobilized. Chinese constables and detectives have disappeared. Everywhere is under the control of Japanese soldiers and Japanese police. Japanese soldiers set up mountain guns and searchlights on the roof of the Zhongyuan Company. Gunfire erupted everywhere after dusk, and there are widespread rumors of a major battle at night. The plainclothes units are stationed at No. 5 and No. 7 Taiping Lane, Penghua Street in the Japanese concession. Many Japanese officers are involved in the conspiracy. The total number is 3,500. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chaos broke out in Tianjin before midnight last night. The sounds of artillery and machine guns were incessant, lasting for about an hour. There was panic throughout the city. Foreign troops and volunteers were armed and on guard. There were three sides firing at the time: one was the Chinese rioters who started the trouble, one was the Chinese soldiers loyal to Zhang Xueliang, and one was the Japanese soldiers in the Japanese concession. Where the chaos started, who was in charge, and what the purpose was, there were many conflicting rumors. Tianjin residents dared not leave their homes all day, not knowing exactly what was happening or who was firing. Later, it was learned that the rioters were attacking Chinese police stations and planning to seize various government offices and railway stations. It is generally believed that the rioters' actions were intended to overthrow local officials loyal to Zhang Xueliang. After receiving the alarm in Beiping, Zhang Xueshi immediately sent armored vehicles to assist in restoring order. After nearly twelve hours of disturbance, order was restored. Foreign troops in various concessions guarded the borders day and night, but only the Japanese troops fired. The Chinese officials in charge condemned the Japanese, saying that the rioters were armed and directed by the Japanese and that the rioters rushed into Chinese territory from the Japanese concession. However, the Japanese said that because the Japanese concession and Chinese territory were adjacent, many stray bullets flew into the concession from Chinese territory, resulting in the death of one Japanese soldier and one junior officer, and that one Japanese woman was injured by a stray bullet. An eyewitness to the beginning and end of the incident told a Reuters reporter that at 11 PM last night, plainclothes Chinese units with Mauser rifles fired near the Japanese military headquarters in the Japanese concession. Japanese armored vehicles were dispatched to clear the streets and fired indiscriminately. The plainclothes units seemed to number several hundred and entered Chinese territory. However, the sounds of rifle fire, machine gun fire, and sometimes mortar fire were intermittent and incessant until this morning. The Chinese authorities mobilized all defense forces and police to protect the area. It was rumored that the plainclothes units intended to loot in Chinese territory. The rioters wore white armbands. The plainclothes units intended to storm police stations, government offices, and railway stations, but were repelled by Chinese armed police. At the time, I did not see any Chinese soldiers participating. Before long, Chinese soldiers occupied positions adjacent to the Japanese concession, and the situation was very serious. I was between Chinese and Japanese soldiers and quickly hid. The Japanese military commander used the deaths of two Japanese soldiers from stray bullets as an excuse to ask Wang Shuchang to withdraw armed military police to a distance of 300 meters from the border of the Japanese concession. This request seems to have been approved and implemented at 7 AM this morning. An hour later, the areas adjacent to the concession gradually returned to normal, but other areas were not yet normal. This afternoon, foreigners who approached Chinese territory were in danger of being shot at. This afternoon, the Chinese area presented a desolate scene. Apart from the occasional police patrol, there were very few pedestrians. Commerce was at a standstill, and government offices, shops, and schools were closed. Even officials were not allowed to leave their homes. Chinese soldiers are now stacking large numbers of sandbags in key locations to strengthen defenses, anticipating that the chaos may recur. The Japanese concession is also very quiet today. Military police patrol the streets, and there are few pedestrians. Machine guns are placed at all key points, and the entrances and exits of the concession are heavily guarded. However, foreigners can enter and exit without hindrance whether on foot or by car, but Chinese who enter and exit the concession must be inspected, otherwise they cannot pass. The other foreign concessions have soldiers, police, and volunteers on alert all day, but everything is peaceful except for the area where the chaos occurred. Business in the concessions is as usual, but many Chinese employees who live in the city dared not venture out this morning.</p>

<p>away from home, so many businesses feel inconvenienced. It is said that many Chinese were killed and injured, but the exact number is difficult to ascertain. According to reliable sources, Japanese troops did not invade Chinese territory, but only limited themselves to defending the border. Chinese officials say that the corpses of the rioters each had forty yuan and Japanese-made pistols, which Chinese people say are the price the rioters received from the Japanese concession to invade Chinese territory. Chinese people blame the Japanese for deliberately creating yesterday's chaos, using the same tactics they used in Shenyang on September 18, and say that a Japanese military officer named Doihara seems to be the mastermind behind this, intending to use this as an excuse to send troops to occupy Tianjin. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today it was reported that Tianjin was occupied by Japanese troops and that Chinese soldiers had fled, which caused great alarm. Before long, further news came, proving the previous statement to be inaccurate, which greatly relieved everyone. This morning, the telephone lines between Beiping and Tianjin were down, and trains were also stopped, but they resumed operations in the afternoon. A spokesman for the Japanese embassy today categorically denied the claim that the Japanese incited the Tianjin riots, saying that this was purely a Chinese internal affair and that Japanese troops were defending the border of the Japanese concession during the disturbances in Chinese territory in the same way as other concessions. The Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin are currently maintaining a strictly neutral attitude and will not interfere in the internal turmoil within Chinese territory. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The sound of gunfire in Tianjin has ceased, but the situation is tense. The plainclothes units are estimated to number between 2,000 and 4,000 and have not yet been eliminated. The Japanese are demanding that the Chinese authorities cede a 300-meter-wide strip of Chinese land adjacent to the Japanese concession and have issued a formal notice prohibiting firing towards the Japanese concession in the event of future disturbances. The Japanese concession has declared martial law, and the Chinese authorities have also declared martial law in the former German and Russian concessions. The Chinese authorities are now taking various precautions within Chinese territory to prevent the recurrence of disturbances. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Land Minister Minami has cancelled his trip to Kyushu tomorrow to review the troops due to the riots in Tianjin. According to news received by the Ministry of the Army, the riots were caused by Chinese who opposed Zhang Xueliang. The riots were limited to Chinese territory and did not spread to the Japanese concession, but one Japanese soldier on defense was killed by a stray bullet. The commander of the Japanese troops in Tianjin has issued a statement saying that he is currently trying to protect 6,000 Japanese nationals, but will maintain strict neutrality as long as it does not infringe on Japanese rights.

<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang's circular telegram stated: All newspapers in the country are hereby notified that at 10:30 PM last night, more than 2,000 plainclothes Chinese men carrying guns suddenly gathered at Haiguang Temple in the Japanese concession. According to those arrested after the incident, they were given large guns, automatic rifles, pistols, and hand grenades under the supervision of several Japanese, and each person was given forty yuan in cash, etc. At about 11 PM, more than a hundred people rushed out of Haiguang Temple and attacked police stations in Chinese territory. At the same time, a large number of plainclothes units rushed out of the Japanese concession, targeting the provincial government, city government, and Public Security Bureau, advancing in different directions. Our city security team and police jointly resisted. At 1 AM, Chairman Wang sent personnel to notify the consuls of various countries to clarify the truth and asked them to pay attention and requested the Japanese consul to be responsible for suppressing the plainclothes units in the Japanese concession. At 4 AM, the commander of the Japanese troops in Tianjin verbally demanded by telephone to Chairman Wang that Chinese troops and security team police, etc., withdraw to an area more than 300 meters away from the Japanese concession before 6 AM that morning. Chairman Wang questioned the reason for this demand. While they were talking, it was reported that another large number of plainclothes units continued to rush out of the Japanese concession. Because the Japanese side's request was unreasonable, Chairman Wang replied that there were no Chinese troops within 300 meters of the Japanese concession, only the security team and police maintaining security, and they were currently doing their best to defend against the rioters, so it was factually inconvenient to order a retreat. At 5:30 AM, the Japanese side again urged Chairman Wang to immediately issue an order to retreat beyond 300 meters. At this time, our police had gradually defeated or injured or forced the plainclothes units to flee back. In order to prevent conflict between the police and the Japanese side, Chairman Wang ordered a retreat before 6 AM. At 6:30 AM, the situation had calmed down, but suddenly more than thirty artillery shells fell into our city. Based on their direction, they came from the Japanese Garden and the Japanese military camp in Haiguang Temple. I am now instructing the military and police to jointly and closely guard the area. I am hereby informing you, Zhang Xueliang, Secret Seal of Jiashen. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shenyang Security Committee Prepares for the Organization of the Provincial Government</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) The previous rumor that the Liaoning Provincial Government was established is not yet true. However, the Shenyang Security Maintenance Committee is currently preparing for the organization of such a government. Yuan Jinkai told a Reuters reporter today that it may be established within a week. The portraits of President Sun and Chairman Jiang have been removed from the reception room of the provincial government today, and a Reuters reporter witnessed their removal. The details of hiring Japanese advisors for the future provincial government are not yet finalized, but it is said that two people may be hired. The bandit suppression work in Liaoning is currently being handled only by the police. It is said that several Japanese soldiers died in Shenyang last night due to mistaking each other for bandits and firing at each other. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>How to Understand the Tanaka Memorial (2)</h3>
<p>Based on Professor Thomas Millard's description of "Japanese Imperialism" quoted in yesterday's commentary, we can understand that Japan's "foreign aggression," particularly its active aggression in Northeast China, is by no means as propagandized by apologists for Japanese imperialism, due to (1) overpopulation and (2) lack of resources. As for the current claims by Japanese militarists and politicians that "Manchuria and Mongolia are Japan's lifeline" and "Manchuria and Mongolia are vital to Japan's national defense," and even the statement by Motoyama Hikoichi, president of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, that "Manchuria and Mongolia on the map look like a pistol pointing at Japan's abdomen, which alone is enough to make the Japanese people sleeplessly pay attention to the interests and security of that area" (see a letter from Yamamoto to Harvard, who runs 25 news outlets in the United States, on October 24), these are extremely absurd and unreasonable fallacies. In fact, they adequately demonstrate that Japan is an evil demon trampling on public reason and justice, because "Manchuria and Mongolia" are Chinese territory. There is not a shred of reason to connect them with Japan's "survival," and the act of forcibly claiming a neighboring country's territory as one's own "national defense key area" is absolutely intolerable to public reason and justice. As for saying that "Manchuria and Mongolia on the map look like a pistol pointing at Japan's abdomen," thereby justifying the forcible occupation of "Manchuria and Mongolia," then if the Japanese suddenly have a whim and feel that "the United States on the map looks like a ferocious beast, baring its fangs and claws, lunging at Japan," or suddenly feel that "Soviet Russia on the map is truly like the so-called 'Bear of the East,' constantly posing a serious threat to Japan," wouldn't Japan also have to "sleeplessly pay attention to the interests and security of that area"? At the same time, as the Japanese see it, we can also say that "Japan on the map looks like a silkworm, gnawing along the edge of the Eurasian continent like a mulberry leaf." Then, in fact, countries established on the Eurasian continent will have no choice but to rise up together and destroy Japan. Using some absurd and untenable reason to try to cover up its ambition and atrocities is originally a common trick of general ambitious people, which is not surprising. However, here we should clearly recognize that the various fallacies mentioned above cannot constitute a reason for Japan's foreign aggression and especially its active aggression in Northeast China. Even more, they cannot be regarded as a valid cause for foreign aggression.</p>
<p>If we want to grasp the reasons for Japan's foreign aggression, we must first recognize that Japan is a member of the international capitalist countries. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan's financial magnates such as the Mitsui and Mitsubishi "kingdoms" have invisibly gained real power to dominate politics. At the same time, they promoted Japan's departure from the ruins of feudalism and embarked on the road of capitalism. The slogan of capitalism in its initial stage was "free competition," but it subsequently transformed into "monopoly" and "exclusive control." What appeared in reality was the overwhelming of general small and medium-sized enterprises domestically, forming organizations such as trusts and syndicates. They monopolized capital and manipulated finance. Abroad, they searched for markets, raw materials, and investment destinations, and began an economic competition with other capitalist countries, further deeply planting the roots of poisoning weak nations. When capitalism gradually developed to its peak, it formed imperialism, which possessed extremely brutal forms. Domestically, it suppressed reactionary forces with violence, and further used slogans such as "promoting national prestige" and "expanding influence" to deceive the people, so that they would willingly die for it. Abroad, it began military competition and violent aggression, and ultimately stirred up a black tide of terror and misery in a peaceful and tranquil world. Especially Japan, when she began to embark on the road of capitalism, the capitalism of the West had grown and matured. As soon as she was reborn, she encountered a formidable enemy. Therefore, in the early stages of its growth, it carried an extremely brutal form, holding militarism and using force to challenge the world and compete with the great powers.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Meiji Restoration, the capitalist class, militarists, bureaucrats, and rulers of Japan established the ocean policy and continental policy for foreign expansion, which is the so-called "legacy of the Meiji Emperor." The outbreak of the two Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars was the implementation of the so-called "legacy of the Meiji Emperor." The annexation of Ryukyu, Taiwan, and Korea was precisely the first step in the success of the "Meiji legacy." After the annexation of Ryukyu and Taiwan, the foundation of the ocean policy was established. After this, it focused all its efforts on the realization of its continental policy. Tanaka's foundation for an active policy toward Manchuria and Mongolia was built on the Meiji legacy. It is a consistent development and a consistent advancement, not accidental and not without reason.</p>
<p>The famous Japanese economist Takahashi Kamekichi said in his article "Sino-Japanese Economic Relations and the Policy of Force Toward China," "In fact, Japanese imperialism has always been criticized by public opinion, and yet it still has to use the old tune of the policy of force to maintain its status as a first-class power. The fundamental reason is nothing more than that it cannot expect the development of its imperialism by economic power alone." Similarly, the Japanese political commentator Suzuki Mosaburo also said in his article "The Union of Japanese National Capital and Zaibatsu Capital in China," "In China, first are the Japanese prostitutes, second are the traffickers of high-grade morphine, and third are the salesmen of Mitsui Bussan Co., all advancing fiercely into the Chinese hinterland under the Japanese flag." These statements fully explain the reasons for Japan's foreign aggression by force. Furthermore, they fully prove the pervasiveness of the Japanese imperialists' aggression against China. At the same time, it is precisely to explain how Japanese militarists and bureaucrats are actively implementing the "legacy of the Meiji Emperor."</p>
<p>Although Tanaka Giichi regarded the China issue as his lifelong ambition and was an ambitious militarist, he was by no means as criticized by his Seiyukai party, "Tanaka's head is a bit strange, doing things that common sense cannot imagine." He was only a loyal executor of the Meiji legacy. He was just a reactionary and ambitious militarist. It was also no accident that the memorial for the active policy toward Manchuria and Mongolia was presented by Tanaka.</p>
<p>We must understand the above explanation in order to grasp why Japanese imperialists carried out foreign aggression and why the Tanaka Memorial was produced. At the same time, we can understand the essence of the Tanaka Memorial and the great conspiracy of Tanaka to harm the world.</p>

<p>National Important News Three</p>
<h3>Doihara's Mission to Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Doihara's original purpose in coming to Tianjin was: (1) To encourage Puyi to organize the Mingguang Empire, which has failed; (2) To collude with disgruntled military officers from Shandong and Shanxi provinces to disturb order. Vice-Zhang has telegraphed the authorities of each province to pay special attention; (3) To plan an attack on Jinzhou; (4) To conspire to disturb Tianjin, Beiping, Zhangjiakou, and Tangshan, creating terror to use as an excuse to advance troops.</p>
<h3>Several Japanese Planes Dropped Bombs in Sanjianfang</h3>
<p>All Japanese Troops in Shenyang Advanced Towards Northern Manchuria</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The diplomatic circle received a telegram from Beiping on the 9th stating that at 8:00 a.m. on the 8th, several Japanese planes dropped many bombs on the positions of our army in Sanjianfang, Heilongjiang Province. At 10:30 a.m., a Japanese plane went to Heilongjiang's provincial capital, circling for about half an hour. In addition, the Japanese side transferred troops stationed in Korea to Shenyang, and all the troops stationed in Shenyang advanced towards northern Manchuria. The majority of the troops arrived at Jiangqiao on the 7th, and they still actively planned to invade Heilongjiang. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This station has just received a telegram from a reporter stating that Ma Zhanshan has already declared war. Ma's troops retreated after fighting with Japanese soldiers in Nenjiang. According to a telegram from Shenyang, Ma Zhanshan has telegraphed Zhang Xueliang to transfer Jilin troops to help resist Japan. The above news has not been officially verified. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the report received by the Army Ministry today, the Manchurian situation is once again in crisis. It is reported that Chinese troops are now concentrated south of Angangxi, which is about twenty miles north of the Japanese troop line in Taonan. It is also reported that there are a total of 5,600 Chinese infantry soldiers, 2,400 cavalry soldiers, and 300 artillery and engineering soldiers, while there are less than 1,000 Japanese soldiers. The number of reinforcements in Taonan is not large, because the reinforcements that were transferred before stopped advancing on the 6th of this month and returned to Changchun.

<h3>The League of Nations Will Announce Japan's Violation of the Charter</h3>
<p>The Council Has the Right to Expel Japan</p>
<p>The Recall of Envoys Has Been Discussed Once</p>
<p>(Geneva) People in the League of Nations, regarding Japan's threat to withdraw from the League of Nations, stated that after the Council reopens on the 16th, it will announce that Japan has violated the League of Nations Charter. In this way, the Council has the right to vote to expel Japan. Regarding Japan's claim that the League of Nations is trying to become a "supreme state," people in the League of Nations solemnly stated that the Council's measures regarding the Liaoning-Jilin dispute that are binding on member states to date are only the resolution of September 30, and Japan personally voted in favor of that resolution through Yoshizawa. It was also said that Japan is now demanding that China give written consent to the five basic points proposed by Shidehara before withdrawing its troops, which is enough to prove that the Japanese military's stationing in the three eastern provinces is no longer intended to protect Japanese residents, but to occupy by force instead of the peaceful methods stipulated by the League of Nations Charter and force China to concede. Japan's position is tantamount to admitting that it has violated the League of Nations Charter, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty. The statement issued by League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute has aroused commentary here today, believing that Mr. Drummond's opinion has no impact because he has no voting rights and only serves as a messenger between the councilors. The councilors will act on their own. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) There is much speculation about what action the League of Nations Administrative Council will take on the Manchurian issue at the next meeting, but Reuters dares to say that there is absolutely no knowledge here of what kind of resolution the Administrative Council will have. If the Japanese troops still do not withdraw by November 16, a serious warning will be sent to Japan. This is obvious, but even Councilor Briand, including members of the Administrative Council, still does not know what kind of resolution the Administrative Council will have. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The officialdom here has not heard of the suggestion to recall foreign ambassadors stationed in Tokyo, but admits that all countries have discussed this. Today, a certain League of Nations official told a Reuters reporter that he could not confirm the news that Chairman Briand and other members had discussed the recall of ambassadors stationed in Japan, because Japan refused to comply with the resolutions of the Administrative Council. It is said that the Administrative Council will decide to withdraw diplomatic representatives stationed in Japan when it meets on the 16th, and then adjourn the meeting for a week or ten days to observe the effectiveness of this warning. If recalling envoys still cannot make Japan change its attitude, the Administrative Council will meet again and invoke Article 11 of the League of Nations Charter, which China is now using to request, or Article 15 of the Charter, to declare an economic severance of relations with Japan. The United States' participation in this boycott requires the consent of its Congress, which is currently in recess and will not meet until December 7. The above suggestions to withdraw diplomatic representatives and sever economic relations with Japan are still just empty talk. The current situation is urgent, so it is no wonder that various rumors and speculations arise. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Well-informed sources here believe that the League of Nations Administrative Council may not take extreme measures such as recalling ambassadors stationed in Japan regarding the Manchurian issue. Although idealists in Geneva are spreading alarming rumors, no formal proposal for this step has been made. There is a need to continue exchanging opinions before dealing with the situation, but extreme measures such as the sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Charter are not an issue. Although legally speaking, war is now going on in Manchuria, neither China nor Japan has mentioned the use of sanctions. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government's Reply to Briand</h3>
<p>Using the Excuse of Repairing the Jiangqiao Bridge to Evade Responsibility for the Challenge</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's response to Briand's note of the 6th regarding the Nenjiang incident was sent to Ambassador Yoshizawa by telegram yesterday morning with instructions to convey it to Briand, and was announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 7:00 p.m. yesterday. The main points are as follows: The cause of the current conflict between the Chinese and Japanese armies is that a small unit of the Japanese army escorted engineers to Nenjiang to repair the railway bridge. However, the Heilongjiang army stationed on the north bank of Nenjiang suddenly opened fire. The Tao'ang Railway was built by the South Manchuria Railway and handed over to China in 1927. However, China has not paid the expenses to date and is unwilling to include it in the loan. Therefore, although the railway has been handed over to China, it can in fact be regarded as the property of the South Manchuria Railway and is one of the railway's feeder lines. The Japanese consul stationed in Qiqihar, in order to protect the interests of the South Manchuria Railway, has repeatedly negotiated with China since mid-October to repair the bridge. However, the Chinese authorities adopted a policy of procrastination and did not allow Japan's request. Recently, the freezing period of Nenjiang is approaching, and there is fear that it will not be able to be repaired. Therefore, the Japanese army decided to escort the engineers of the South Manchuria Railway to carry out the bridge repair. First, in order to avoid conflict, the Japanese consul and the staff officer of the Kwantung Army requested the Heilongjiang provincial authorities to withdraw the Heilongjiang army 10 kilometers back from the north bank of Nenjiang. However, the Heilongjiang army had not withdrawn by November 4, and when the Japanese army arrived near Jiangqiao, it suddenly began shelling. The Japanese army temporarily retreated, and after reinforcements arrived, it repelled the Heilongjiang army at noon on the 6th. The purpose of the Japanese army's dispatch this time is as described above, which is to escort the bridge repair work. However, due to the untrustworthy behavior of the Chinese troops, it had no choice but to take an offensive attitude. The Central Army Headquarters has ordered the commander of the army not to expand military operations any further. (9th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Japanese representative Yoshizawa notified Briand today that the Japanese army cannot withdraw from the South Manchuria Railway concession at this time. Yoshizawa was replying to a recent letter from Briand, in which he repeatedly stated that Japan cannot withdraw its troops at this time because China has not yet guaranteed law and order within the territory of the three eastern provinces. (8th Kuomintang Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Will Protest to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Believing that the Secretariat Is Gradually Becoming a Chinese Propaganda Bureau</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources, the Japanese government will instruct Yoshizawa to protest to League of Nations Administrative Council Chairman Briand or to Secretary-General Drummond, opposing the League of Nations' gradual transformation into a Chinese propaganda bureau and its unsatisfactory methods of spreading anti-Japanese air, pointing out that League of Nations Health Bureau representative in China, Dr. Rajchman, and Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen live together at the Shanghai Eurasia Radio Station, and the radio station often sends Chinese propaganda texts to the League of Nations. Japan also accused the League of Nations Secretariat of hastily disseminating Chinese propaganda without verifying its words. Japan also said that according to reliable sources, Dr. Rajchman, with the assistance of former League of Nations Secretary Watson, has spent no less than 120,000 yuan on telegram fees to the League of Nations in several weeks. The Japanese protest will also strongly criticize the irresponsible behavior of the League of Nations Secretariat in spreading the news that the great powers may withdraw their diplomatic representatives stationed in Japan. The protest will also state that, in the view of the Japanese, the League of Nations Secretariat has no right to disseminate the unverified reports sent to the League of Nations by the Chinese during the recess of the Administrative Council, because Japan has not reported false and incomplete shocking rumors to the League of Nations. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Secret Diplomacy between the United States and Japan</h3>
<p>The Recommendation Documents Have Not Been Published</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Manchurian case, Japan is willing to accept the recommendations of the League of Nations, but cannot be directed by the League of Nations. Today, it seems that both political and non-political circles in Tokyo share this sentiment. In addition to criticizing the League of Nations for credulously believing China's reports, Japan's resentment towards the League of Nations is deepening because the League of Nations Secretariat now values the consequences of the Sino-Japanese dispute and undervalues the cause of the Sino-Japanese dispute. Therefore, it seems that there is no doubt that Japan would rather withdraw from the League of Nations than submit to the orders of the League of Nations, because the Japanese view submission as related to its survival. Japan is now also gradually showing anxiety about so-called secret diplomacy, and is paying special attention to the official document delivered by the US Ambassador to Japan to the Japanese Foreign Minister on November 5. The content of the document has not been published in accordance with the understanding between the two countries. Japan's reply has already been drafted and will probably be sent out tonight. Its content will also not be published, but it is currently believed that its nature is mostly the same as the document replying to Briand on October 29. Political circles are very dissatisfied with this kind of secret official document, because they fear that it will cause alarming rumors outside. It is said that the Japanese government intends to ask the United States to allow its publication. Political circles also said that the behavior of secret diplomacy is very beneficial to China.

<h3>The Shenyang Pseudo-Joint Committee Will Hold a Reorganization Meeting</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Shenyang Joint Committee will hold a reorganization meeting. The local maintenance committee will allocate 300,000 yuan for political expenses. Kan Zhaoxi is willing to take the post of Qingxiang Superintendent, and it is said that Zhao Enzhen and Mu Chun will be in charge of handling the affairs. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Various British Newspaper Views</h3>
<p>London, the British "Hueiwen" newspaper's editorial this morning said, "In the confusing reports, one thing is very clear, that is, Japan is denying war on the one hand and carrying out war on the other. We do not say that China is justified, but Japan's continued pursuit of its current methods is truly unreasonable." The "Morning Post", which has a pro-Japanese color, said, "It is doubtful whether the intervention of the League of Nations can truly help pacifism." The "Daily Express" said, "A country that has suffered many earthquakes cannot be shaken by the thunder of Geneva." The "Daily Mail" advocated not being involved in the Manchurian affair. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Telegraphed that Japanese Troops Invaded the Territory</h3>
<p>Longjiang Ma Zhanshan's circular telegram said, "All newspaper offices, elders and brothers throughout the country, please be aware that after the Liaoning and Jilin changes, the Japanese used various methods to collude with bandits, Mongolian bandits, and bad elements to plot against northern Manchuria, using the name of Chinese independence to secretly carry out their ambition to invade land and political power. The Jiang Province is far from the border and is doing its best to defend itself. However, the Japanese blatantly came forward on the 1st of the month, using the excuse of repairing the Nenjiang River Bridge to escort Zhang Haipeng's army from Taonan across the river with Japanese soldiers, oppressing our defense area and launching an attack. In the past two days, the Japanese used eight aircraft and more than 20 cannons to fiercely encircle and attack, and the situation is that they will not stop until they directly attack the provincial capital of Jiang Province. In addition, the Nenjiang River Bridge belongs to our country. What right does Japan have to interfere? Zhanshan originally believed that the League of Nations had a solution to this matter and insisted on avoiding conflict, but the Japanese ignored world peace and consistently pursued their ambition to invade Manchuria and Mongolia. The Jiang Province is in a position of having no choice but to fight with force in order to urgently defend itself. A major disaster is imminent, and the country is about to perish. We can only temper the troops under our command and swear to resist to the death, and we will not hesitate to make all sacrifices. We earnestly ask the elders throughout the country to work hard and cheer up to save the country from danger. I am extremely indignant. Acting Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government Ma Zhanshan, pressed with a fish seal." (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Again Assisted Bandits in Disturbing Western Liaoning</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After the destruction of the bandit troops of Ling Yinqing, who were assisted by the Japanese army, the Japanese secretly ordered Wang Dianzhong to organize the Far East People's Self-Defense Army, with Luo Jiutian as the Chief of Staff and Jin Wutang and Tang Chengtian as Staff Officers. According to Japanese propaganda, the bandit army has Cui Baoshan near Xinmintun as the First Army, with 5,000 bandits; Zhang Xuecheng and Du Tianyi in Liaozhong as the Second Army, with 2,000 bandits; Xiao Mengxiu in Kangping, west of the Liao River, as the Third Army, with 2,000 bandits; and a certain bandit leader in Beizhen, north of Goubangzi, as the Fourth Army, with 4,000 bandits, totaling 13,000 people. The Japanese also propagandized that the bandit army is jointly organized by Mongolian Living Buddhas, Mongolian soldiers, White Russians, and Manchus, consisting of seven ethnic groups. After the armies have finished their liaison, Wang Dianzhong will issue a declaration and start attacking Jinzhou. The First Army will advance westward along the Beining Road after occupying Xinmintun, the Second Army will advance from Liaozhong and Tai'an, the Third Army will advance from Kangping, and the Fourth Army will advance from Beizhen to concentrate and attack Goubangzi. This is what the Japanese have spread and has yet to be verified, but our country has no choice but to make full preparations. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The telegraph paper of the Guangdong Radio Bureau often prints sentences such as "Swear to avenge the national humiliation, reject enemy goods, persevere to the end, and never forget." When the Japanese Consul Suma saw it, he sent a letter to the municipal government, saying that these sentences clearly refer to anti-Japanese sentiment and are really difficult to tolerate. He hoped to find a way to stop them. The municipal government replied with a letter refuting it, saying that this is a patriotic act and is just a vague expression, which is difficult to interfere with. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>International Chamber of Commerce Silver Expert Committee Issues Report</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 9th: The Silver Expert Committee dispatched by the International Chamber of Commerce to consider whether immediate international action could improve the status of silver has today issued its report. The report advocates for the establishment of a more stable position for silver prices, a higher market price, and the conclusion of a sales contract between North American silver miners and the Indian government. The report states that China has suffered greatly in recent years, but the fall in silver prices is only one of the reasons. Indeed, China is the only country in the world where prices and daily life change the least. Although the Chinese government intends to adopt the gold standard, silver will remain the main standard of Chinese currency for many years to come. The committee now believes that China can still bear a gradual and steady increase in the gold value of its currency, but the increase should not be too large or too fast. This year's silver production is estimated to total 200 million ounces, worth approximately US$56 million. If a group in the United States and the Indian Treasury can negotiate a contract, allowing participants to allocate a considerable amount of silver for sale in the world, it can maintain silver prices at a level that is not detrimental to both buyers and sellers. As silver prices rise, Chinese exchange rates will also rise accordingly. Any significant increase will reduce China's exports and increase its imports. This will benefit those exporting to China, but the amount of silver included in the increased imports into China cannot be predetermined. Supplying it sequentially at a reasonable price will maintain the demand for silver. Therefore, a sudden or excessive rise in silver prices should be avoided. Prematurely determining the price to be achieved is also a major mistake. Therefore, North American silver miners and smelters should negotiate sales contracts with the Indian government. Sales contracts without the participation of the Indian government will not be effective. It is hoped that the Indian government will agree not to sell its silver reserves except at prices higher than those set for silver producers. This section is extremely unfair and is bound to fail. Several parties should work together. The contract should naturally stipulate that any participant may withdraw from the contract, either temporarily or permanently, after any agreed notice period. However, silver may not be sold independently until the contract expires. The report recommends that using silver as part of the reserve for paper currency can reduce the risk of gold shortages. The report does not recommend stipulating the ratio of gold to silver prices, but argues that any government that cannot obtain enough gold to meet its needs should consider purchasing some silver and issuing smaller denomination banknotes, with silver reserves equivalent to the full value of the gold coins replaced. This type of banknote, along with banknotes partially backed by gold, would circulate simultaneously, thereby expanding the basis of credit through the authority of the government. Silver can often be purchased at a low price, so the benefits of silver are endless. The committee believes that the International Chamber of Commerce should urge governments to restore the pre-war fineness of subsidiary coinage, which would restore confidence in the value of silver worldwide. The committee ultimately advocates studying new uses for silver to increase silver sales.</p>

It is hoped that all of you will prioritize the country and take personal gain lightly, unconditionally make peace with all parties, lead the people to fight to the death against Japan, wash away the shame for China, and ensure the survival of the five races. Then we overseas Chinese will devote ourselves to the cause and await orders. Otherwise, the country will perish under the party and the party will perish under the bandits. Whose fault will it be?

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army's Ravaging of Liaodong Province</h3>
<p>A correspondent from Beiping reports: The old eastern border region of Liaoning Province includes twenty counties: Andong, Xinbin, Tonghua, Fengcheng, Kuandian, Huanren, Linjiang, Ji'an, Changbai, Antu, Fusong, Fushun, Benxi, Hailong, Huinan, Liuhe, Jin County, Fuxian, Xiuyan, and Zhuanghe. During this incident, except for Andong, where news is easily disseminated due to convenient transportation and is occasionally seen in domestic newspapers, the situation in other counties under the ravages of the brutal Japanese army is rarely recorded in newspapers both north and south. It is as if the Japanese army has not taken any action against the eastern Liaoning counties. In reality, this is due to inconvenient transportation and isolated news. The killings by the brutal Japanese army are no less severe than in the Shenyang-Jilin area. The following is based on a conversation with a gentleman who recently arrived in Beiping from Shanchengzi (the garrison of the Eastern Border Defense Commissioner) and is presented as an introduction (the following is the gentleman's account):</p>
<p>"The eastern border region encompasses twenty counties and is the most resource-rich area in the entire province. Products such as ginseng, deer antlers, soybeans, and timber are among the most significant specialties. However, for more than a decade, it has been plagued by rampant bandits, and the people have lived in abject poverty. The great prosperous area has almost become a bandit world. Since the reorganization of the Northeast Army in the winter of the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Eastern Border Defense Commissioner Yu Zhishan has led his troops to be stationed there, overseeing the suppression of bandits. For the past three years, the roots have gradually been eradicated, and the notorious bandit area has begun to transform into a peaceful homeland. However, the September 18th Incident suddenly broke out. On the afternoon of the 19th, Shanchengzi received news that the Japanese army had occupied Shenyang and Changchun. The residents were extremely panicked upon hearing this news. While they were discussing it, the sound of Japanese aircraft whirring had already arrived from the direction of Panshi (belonging to Jilin) and flew over Chaoyangzhen and Hailong towards Changchun. Subsequently, an inquiry was made by the town government via long-distance telephone, and it was learned that five heavy bombs had been dropped in the Panshi County market, killing three farmers and workers and injuring five. Three bombs were dropped in Hailong, killing one police chief and injuring four farmers, as well as destroying one telephone. Three bombs were dropped in Chaoyangzhen, all landing in open areas, fortunately without injuring anyone. Leaflets were also scattered in Panshi, generally stating, 'The Japanese army's dispatch of troops this time is indeed due to China destroying its South Manchuria Railway, leaving it no choice but to defend itself. Merchants and residents should not be alarmed,' and other various divisive words. On the afternoon of the 21st, news of the fall of Jilin was received. From that day onward, Japanese aircraft bombed and reconnoitered important towns and cities along the Shenyang-Hailong and Jilin-Hailong routes every day. Unresisting civilians died under the bombs. According to known information, in addition to the aforementioned Panshi and other counties, Shanchengzi suffered four farmers killed and five injured by bombing. In Qingyuan County, three people were killed and five injured. In Yinggemen, one passenger on a train was killed, one railway policeman was injured, and one passenger car was destroyed. In Yingpanjie, two farmers were injured. In Yantongshan, one merchant was killed and three injured. The number of other unknown casualties is still unknown. On the afternoon of October 2nd, a telephone call was received from the village chief of Xinglongtai, about seventy li west of Shanchengzi, stating that more than a thousand Japanese soldiers allied with bandits had arrived at Dagujiazi, about ten li west of the village, at 2 PM and were camping there. They searched for civilian self-defense firearms and arrested village chief Guo, severely interrogating him before shooting him. They also buried two villagers alive because they were suspected of harboring resentment against Korean residents. Furthermore, there was news that the army would advance towards Shanchengzi the next day. Upon receiving this alarming news, various legal entities feared that Garrison Commander Yu Zhishan had received orders not to resist and retreat. If the Japanese army were to enter and bandits took the opportunity to rise up, the eastern border would be even more unbearable. They immediately contacted nearby towns and cities by telephone, inquiring with the Japanese consulates stationed in each location about the purpose of the Japanese army's arrival. If they were coming to seize territory, then they would have to endure being trampled upon. If they claimed to be protecting Japanese and Korean residents, then the lives and property of Japanese and Korean residents in the eastern border counties had never been in danger. If the Japanese army came, it would arouse public resentment and perhaps turn it against the residents. After repeated negotiations, the Japanese consuls repeatedly stated that they could understand but refused to guarantee to the Japanese army and prevent their advance. On the morning of the 3rd, gentlemen from various towns and cities near Shanchengzi were invited by the Japanese consul to gather at the Shanchengzi railway station and board a train to the Caozhi railway station, about forty li west of Shanchengzi, intending to dissuade them."</p>

<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<p>"The Japanese army advancing eastward from Dagujiazi simultaneously received a telephone call from the Shenyang-Hailong Railway Bureau, stating that a combined force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, numbering approximately one thousand, was traveling eastward from Shenyang this morning at 6 AM on three trains, with an armored car protecting the front, and seemed to be spying on the movements of the Northeast Armies retreating from the east of the province, claiming to be reconnoitering. Upon hearing this alarming news, the gentlemen and representatives of the legal entities invited the Japanese consul to go to Yingpan to dissuade them. Upon arriving at Yingpan, the Japanese consul inquired by telephone where the Japanese army had arrived and received a reply that they had arrived at Qiandian. They then requested the Japanese consul to contact the Japanese army commander by telephone, confirming that the Japanese and Korean residents were not in any danger, and arranged for the commander to meet at Yingpan railway station to state this in person. The Japanese commander agreed not to advance further and telegraphed the troops advancing eastward from Xinglongtai to retreat at the same time. As a result, the eastern border regions have been able to barely maintain peace until now. However, the Japanese are actively carrying out actions to incite the independence of various counties. Maintenance societies have already been established in Fushun, Benxi, and Andong. Furthermore, the Japanese army has sent people to request an audience with Yu Zhishan three times, requesting him to lead his troops to withdraw, but Yu has avoided meeting them. The reason why the Japanese army does not dare to take active action is not because they fear Yu Zhishan, nor because they love the people of the eastern border regions. It is said that because the Japanese army's ambition lies in northern Manchuria, most of the large forces have already gone north, believing that the eastern border counties are already turtles in a jar and fish in a cauldron, and they can come back later and settle them with a proclamation. Therefore, the people of the eastern border regions will still be able to steal a moment of respite for a while," (Morning of the 8th of the 11th month).</p>
<h3>Japanese Army's Violent Inspection of Mail and Telegraphs in Shenyang</h3>
<p>▲Intended to prevent the leakage of violent acts▲But the fact is that attempts to cover up the truth are futile</p>
<p>"The Shanghai Evening Post" reports that the strictness of the Japanese military officers' censorship of news related to the Liaoning-Jilin Incident is almost the same as during the European War. This newspaper has obtained concrete evidence sufficient to prove the excessive detail of the Japanese censorship. Many of the telegrams sent by this newspaper's correspondent in Shenyang have been completely withheld by the Japanese, and the rest have often been deleted and altered, often losing the original meaning of the text. Currently, communication between that place and the outside world, telegrams must all pass through Tokyo, and mail must also be subject to strict inspection. For example, the telegram sent from Shenyang on the 25th of last month, the manuscript sent by the correspondent by mail has now been received. After checking, a paragraph has been deleted by the censor, which states that a certain Chinese deputy comprador of Citibank went to the Frontier Bank to collect 400,000 yuan, but was brutally beaten by Japanese soldiers and imprisoned in a room. Finally, he managed to report to the Citibank manager, who reported it to the American consul and protested to the Japanese consul, and was then released. Furthermore, the Frontier Bank was also ordered by the Japanese military authorities not to pay checks issued by the Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau for the construction of the Huludao seaport by the Dutch company. Although the Japanese government and the Japanese representative in Geneva have declared that Chinese government-run banks and silver firms have resumed business, Zhuang placed them under strict restrictions. Except for a very small limit on personal accounts, they are practically unable to operate. Recently, the commander of the Kwantung Army issued a notice authorizing soldiers to seal up businesses when they suspect them of trading with the enemy of the Japanese army. In the past, most of the transactions of foreign merchants here were related to Chinese government agencies. The new regulations of the Japanese army have caused business to stagnate. Foreign banks and businesses have been greatly affected. It is reported that American merchants have reported this situation to their headquarters in New York, Chicago, etc., requesting direct intervention from the US State Department, etc. In addition, regarding the news that Han De, the correspondent of the International News Agency, and Professor Thorfrann of the University of California were arrested for taking pictures at Shenyang Station, it was stated that the American consul had lodged a formal protest because the Japanese consul and military authorities had stated that photography was allowed. However, when a representative of Paramount Pictures wanted to film a movie recently, the Japanese banned the filming of newsreels and only allowed them to film some unimportant movies on the streets of the Japanese concession, etc., which was also deleted by the Japanese censor. The harshness of the censorship can be seen from this."</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army's Absurd Claims in Andong</h3>
<p>▲Regardless of Everything, Moving Forward Bravely▲Not Afraid of Even the Allied Nations</p>
<p>"A correspondent from Andong reports that the Japanese army occupying Andong withdrew a portion of its troops on the 30th of last month. Currently, only the Maritime Public Security Bureau, the Commercial Port Public Security Bureau, the County Public Security Bureau, and the County Government are stationed with Japanese military police. The Japanese troops from other agencies have already been withdrawn. Since the withdrawal of the Japanese army, they have repeatedly posted so-called announcements to reassure the people. Recently, a red paper leaflet printed in lead type was posted in the city, with the title 'Determination of the Japanese Army.' The original text is as follows: 'The occurrence of this major incident in Manchuria is also considered a great regret by us soldiers. However, since the situation is already like this, we must be aware of turning disaster into blessing. We firmly believe that through this incident, we can liberate the 30 million people of the Northeast. From now on, we soldiers will work harder to completely settle the 30 million people of the Northeast in a happy state, until the construction of a civilized paradise for the Japanese, Koreans, Manchus, Mongols, and Chinese masses is completed. The two previous Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, plus this incident, are all aimed at establishing the right to self-defense for the survival of the Japanese nation and bringing peace to the East. The mission of us Japanese soldiers is completely upright and great, which is of course understandable to the general public. In order to seek the happiness of the 30 million people of the Northeast and complete this great undertaking, we soldiers realize that it will take two or three years. During the period when we soldiers complete this undertaking, we must be fearless and move forward bravely, brace our spirits, overcome all difficulties, and steadily and step by step open up a paradise with practical achievements, taking this justice as the foundation and spreading the Kingly Way. However, if anyone interferes with us soldiers, no matter who it is, they will all be regarded as enemies and conquered. Even if it is the allied nations, we have nothing to fear.'

<h3>Central Committee and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>▲Central Party Headquarters, 9 AM on the 9th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 137th Premier's Memorial Week, attended by Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Ji, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Liu Wendao, Ding Weifen, Zhu Jiahua, Ye Chucang, Cai Yuanpei, Chen Mingshu, Wu Tiecheng, Fang Juehui, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Chen Bulei, Cheng Tianfang, Chu Minyi, Miao Peicheng, Enhebatu, Huang Shi, Kong Xiangxi, Wang Jiuling, Chen Zhaoying, Yu Jingtang, and all the reducers, a total of more than 600 people. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the ceremony, Zhang Ji reported that our country is now facing such a difficult time. During the Premier's Memorial Week, we always feel sorry for the Premier in front of the Premier's portrait. If the Premier were still alive, our country would be very strong, and the current difficulties could also be safely overcome under the leadership of the Premier. Now, unfortunately, the Premier can no longer personally lead us. When we encounter such a national disaster, comrades often think about how to repay the Premier, inherit the Premier's legacy, and follow the Premier's instructions to overcome this difficulty. I personally believe that the Kuomintang has a revolutionary history of more than 40 years, and it was created by the Premier's lifelong hardships. We have this foundation of more than 40 years, relying on the Premier's spirit in heaven, we will be able to unite and save this national disaster. As long as we all have self-confidence and unity, we will be able to repay the people and live up to our ancestors of 4,000 years. But if we want to save the country, we must identify our policies and paths, especially to recognize the general trend in the world. For more than ten years, I have often paid attention to the relationship between China and Japan, and the relationship between the Chinese Kuomintang and Japan. I feel that on the one hand, China and Japan have the same language and culture, and should logically become brotherly countries. On the other hand, the Premier has spent a lot of effort to promote Japan's awareness, and China and Japan should work together to maintain peace in East Asia and promote East Asian civilization. However, the Premier's hard work and efforts have resulted in zero. The fault lies not in China, not in the Chinese Kuomintang, but in Japan, especially the Japanese warlords. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has taken the wrong path because of its military victory. The Japanese warlords are very domineering, and Asia has become an unstable situation. In Europe, large and small countries with different languages and cultures can coexist and prosper, but Japan is always destroying international morality, only seeking its own survival and prosperity, regardless of the world's public opinion. On the one hand, it uses force to annex. Ryukyu is a beautiful island, under the protection of China, it was extremely peaceful, but Japan insisted on annexing it. Taiwan followed the same path. Korea has a history of 2,000 years of independence, and China has always recognized its independent status, but Japan also destroyed it. In this case, how can Japan be said to be a civilized country, a country that abides by international morality? This time, the issue of the three northeastern provinces occurred, and Japan took the wrong path again. So Japan's past actions are all wrong, they are the behavior of aggression in the Middle Ages. I often go to Japan and point out their mistakes to the Japanese. From more than ten years of observation, I know that although Japan is not without people who understand the general trend, the awakened elements are ultimately no match for the traditional forces of the Japanese warlords. I often feel that if Japan does not correct its delusional psychology, it will eventually become an obstacle to world peace. This time, the Japanese army invaded and occupied our eastern provinces, which can be regarded as fully demonstrating their tyranny. China has suffered such a major insult. In order to protect the survival of the nation and public opinion, in addition to the determination to die, unite and fight to the end, there is no other way out. From the end of the 18th century to the beginning of the 19th century, Napoleon invaded Germany. After the German people were ravaged by France, what was the attitude of their nation? In 1870, after the Franco-Prussian War, Germany regained the two states of Alsace-Lorraine and besieged Paris, making a city-under-siege alliance. From that time until 1914, during these 44 years, what was the spirit of the French people? Since the Western countries have such good precedents in front of them, we should follow their spirit to deal with the national crisis. China is the most peace-loving nation in the world, and it is also a nation that does not hesitate to sacrifice everything to support public opinion. Therefore, we have no so-called relatives, enemies, friends, or enemies in the world. Any country that can respect public opinion can be regarded as a friendly country. In the past few years, we have made a mistake ourselves, that is, we only shouted to overthrow all imperialism, but we have not been able to work hard, strive for self-reliance, and show the strength of our nation. So the Japanese took this opportunity to think that they could take advantage of the situation, and greatly exerted their strength. Now the International League of Nations and friendly countries have felt that upholding public opinion and protecting world peace is the common responsibility of the world and our China. The world has a full understanding of our spirit of upholding public opinion and resisting violence. We should correct and punish these bad elements and bad nations in the world, which is not worthy of the meaning of the modern world. Our nation must also have its own meaning, to unite and express that 400 million Chinese people are a whole nation, and give play to our strength. But the so-called 400 million people uniting is an empty word. The most important thing is that our Kuomintang, which leads the people, must hold the supreme sacrifice and unite, and then we can lead the people, compete for our position in the world, and get international assistance. Then the unscrupulous country will not be afraid that he will not yield or bow his head. After the report, the meeting adjourned."</p>
<p>▲National Government, 10 AM on the same day, the National Government held the Premier's Memorial Week, attended by He Yingqin, Ru Yuli, He Yaozu, Li Shuhua, Ma Fuxiang, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Qicai, Li Jinlun, Lin Xiang, Wu Siyu, and other five hundred people. Chairman He Yingqin, after the ceremony, He reported on the experience of suppressing bandits in Jiangxi Province. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM."</p>
<h3>The Impasse of the Jiaoji Coal Surge Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>▲Miners and coal merchants will go to Beijing again to petition</p>
<p>"A correspondent from Jinan reports that the miners and coal merchants along the Jiaoji Railway announced a strike on the 1st due to the Jiaoji Railway's increase in freight rates by 20%. As of today (the 7th), it has been a week and has not yet returned to normal. Jinan does not store much coal, and the winter demand is very urgent. The coal source has been cut off for the past 7 days, and the coal price has gradually increased. Although the Ministry of Railways has mediated in the middle, the Railway Bureau and the miners and coal merchants have held meetings in Qingdao, but the meetings have broken down and there is no hope of resolution. Now, the representatives of the miners and coal merchants, Ding Jingchen and others, have arrived in Jinan again. According to the talks, the Railway Bureau initially requested during the Qingdao meeting: (1) The Railway Bureau purchases coal at the old price, paying 4.7 yuan per ton; (2) Coal for domestic sales still increases the freight rate by 20% (the reason is that the coal mining industry has recognized it in April). The miners and coal merchants believe that purchasing coal at the old price of 4.7 yuan per ton is too much of a loss and cannot comply with the order. A lower price is acceptable. The second point is that the increase in freight rates for domestic sales must be completely canceled, because differential treatment cannot face the mainland public. Later, the Railway Bureau stated that the Ministry of Railways could cancel the increase in domestic sales, so it indicated that (1) the Jiaoji Railway could increase the coal purchase price; (2) the increase in domestic sales could be canceled, but the order to cancel the domestic price increase must be issued after the road coal price is stipulated. The miners and coal merchants believe that the stipulation of the road coal price and the cancellation of the domestic sales price increase cannot be confused, and must be handled separately. The Railway Bureau should not use this as a threat, and the meeting became deadlocked. It is reported that Ding Jingchen, Yang Yuan, Li Zumo and others have scheduled to go to Beijing from Jinan on the 8th to petition the Ministry of Railways again. (November 7th)"</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>"Dachang Rice Shop in Fengjing was Robbed" The Dachang Rice Shop in Dongzhaikou, Fengjing, has a reputation for its flourishing business. Suddenly, on the evening of the 8th, more than a dozen bandits armed with weapons broke into the shop, searched and robbed it, causing losses of more than 3,000 taels of silver, and escaped with the loot.</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>"Water Police Intercepts Bandit Ship and Rescues Abducted Victim" In recent times, robberies have been frequently reported in the lakeside areas of various villages in Wu County. The Third District of the Water Police has dispatched a large number of police boats to search and suppress the bandits. On the 8th of this month, the water police encountered bandits in front of the temple and captured a bandit ship. The seventh and fifteenth detachments of the water police encountered bandits in Maoqi Port and opened fire for half an hour, capturing two bandits, Chen A'er and Shi, and rescuing the abducted victim, Chen Yinbao (from Xihua), as well as three bandit ships and one rifle.</p>
<p>"Why are there so many suicides in Suzhou?" Recently, suicide cases have been reported daily in Suzhou. It is reported that Ma Yunlong, a traveler from Shanghai, committed suicide by swallowing opium in Room 34 of the Lichang Hotel. In addition, Chen Yueying (formerly surnamed Zhang), a female traveler in Room 58 of the Sanxin Hotel, about 20 years old, committed suicide by slitting her throat with scissors. The reason for her suicide was a marriage issue. Yesterday (the 9th) at about 6 PM, a certain A, who lived in Han Yaya Village and was engaged in carving fan bones, committed suicide by cutting his throat with a knife due to economic reasons and family disputes. His life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>"Private Smuggling Squad Destroys Xiaoyao You Theater" After Xu Biyun came to Changshu to perform at the local Xiaoyao You Theater, business was not very prosperous. Because the ticket collection problem was slightly stricter, a plainclothes officer from the tenth private smuggling squad stationed in Changshu had an argument at the theater because he did not buy a ticket. Unexpectedly, the officer harbored resentment and gathered many officers on the night of the 7th, dressed in various clothes, some in plain clothes and some in military uniforms, to watch the play at the theater. Unexpectedly, at about 9 PM, on the pretext of tea, a man blew a police whistle, and they stood up from all sides and started beating people. At that time, teacups, teapots, tables and chairs were flying around, and the order was in chaos. The audience fled in panic, and those who could not escape were also affected. The police officers who were suppressing the scene could not stop them and left. The officers did whatever they wanted. After the theater was destroyed, they went outside to find staff to beat up, and also went to the Yingming Club to destroy it. The glass windows and teacups were broken, and the tables and chairs were also knocked down. At that time, Gao, the company commander of the garrison security team, happened to be present. Seeing this situation, he was furious. Because he had a short gun in the hands of the police, he showed it as a warning. The private smuggling officers then blew the whistle and left. When they left, they also stood in line outside and reported the number, so this matter was definitely prepared in advance. The theater stopped playing that night, and the directors before and after the stage demanded that the garrison police and the Public Security Bureau do their best to protect them. Shen, the battalion commander of the security team, rushed to the scene after hearing the news. The officers who caused the trouble had already dispersed, so he called Wang Zushan, the captain of the squadron, to Jincheng to handle the aftermath. At that time, Wang had just returned from Shanghai and did not know the details. Hearing the alarming news, he put on his clothes and entered the city. At that time, Battalion Commander Shen, for the sake of local security and military discipline, had a negotiation with Wang. Xuan Wang admitted that the restraint was not strong and was willing to take full responsibility. It was not until dawn that the discussion was settled. After Captain Wang Zushan of the private smuggling squad returned to the squadron, he found out that the culprit was Zhuang Keqin, the captain of the No. 1 patrol boat, and immediately sent him to the Public Security Bureau to be dealt with according to law. On the one hand, he also punished the officers who caused the trouble with military sticks, and then entered the city to investigate the theater and was willing to compensate for all losses and apologize to all parties. The Yingming Club, in the inspection of losses, found a box of cannonballs, so they immediately sent representatives to the Public Security Bureau to meet with Director Yin Peng, handed in a memorial, demanding that the troublemakers compensate for the losses, and also asked to investigate the bullets. Xuan Jing, the private smuggling team, declared that the squadron headquarters did not have a short gun, and that no one was carrying a weapon at that time, so the lost bullet was definitely not left by the officers of the team, and also requested an investigation. Therefore, Yin, the director of the Public Security Bureau, must carefully study this bullet and strive to understand it. As for Yang Keqin, the culprit who was taken away, he will either be sent to the judiciary or the camp headquarters for punishment in the future. The theater will still perform as usual the next day.</p>
<p>"The Case of the Sudden Death of a Female Principal Involves Relevant Persons" In the case of Hu Tinglian, the female principal of Yanhang Elementary School, whose death is unknown, the family members have now twisted Wu Xiaosheng, who is a major suspect, to the Public Security Bureau, and transferred him to the judiciary for interrogation. Now, the hearing officer Yang Xin has summoned Wang Yin, a female maid of the school, and Zhang Xiguan, a local Ding, for a secret interrogation, and banned onlookers. The plaintiff Hu Yuanpu (the cousin of the deceased) requested the court to thoroughly investigate the cause of death in detail to clear the injustice. Wu Xiaosheng still confessed that because his son was studying at the school, he had been acting as a doctor and decocting medicine, but he did not know anything else. The local Ding and the female school servant all confessed that they did not know the cause of death. Xuan will temporarily detain Wu, and the school servant will be released by the local Ding for investigation and verification. However, the relatives of the corpse have now found a photo of a man and many love letters in the coffin of the deceased, with the signature Gu Moumou. It is said that Hu Tinglian was quite romantic during her lifetime. When she was the principal of Xieqiao Elementary School, she had a relationship with Gu, which was later discovered. The tabloids detailed the matter, so the authorities dismissed her. Afterwards, there were frequent letters and correspondence. Now, Gu is working in the Third Education Hall and likes painting. The relatives of the corpse also believe that this person has a major relationship, and immediately requested the Education Bureau to thoroughly investigate.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Robbery of Three Families and Assault of Victims in the Sixteenth District (Tianxia City), near the Tangtou Town of Zhuxiang. Yang Genpan, a villager from the countryside, has been a steady farmer. On the evening of the eighth day of the previous month, at 11 PM, seven robbers suddenly appeared, dressed in short blue cloth shirts, wearing peaked caps, speaking in a strong northern accent. Each held a fake handgun, broke down the door, and immediately beat up Yang Genpan's grandmother, Mrs. Hu, severely. Her left shoulder, eyes, ears, and other areas were seriously injured. The robbers then searched the house, stealing over thirty silver dollars from a Buddhist association. Subsequently, they went to Xie Gansheng's house in Xiexing for robbery. When they saw Xie's son, A Da's wife, Mrs. Li, who was heavily pregnant, they became enraged and kicked her twice. Mrs. Li's fetus was seriously injured, and she immediately collapsed on the ground, unconscious. They dragged Gansheng's sick wife from the bed, forcing her to reveal the location of hidden silver. They then ransacked boxes and chests, extensively looting, resulting in a loss of over two hundred dollars. Finally, they went to a certain surname's house in Lixing for robbery, the amount of loss is unknown.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth Merchants Oppose Changing the Principles of the Fine Yarn Fund. The dyeing and weaving factories in Jiangyin use fine yarn and thread, which are scarce in domestic production, and have been buying Japanese goods. Since the Wanbaoshan Incident in September, the whole country has been indignant and boycotting Japanese goods. The Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association, for the sake of raw materials for various factories, imitated the "May 3rd" anti-Japanese measures and levied a fine yarn factory fund. It was agreed that this fund would be collected up to one million taels, and then action would be taken to open the factory. If the amount was insufficient, the factories in various counties would subscribe for shares. On September 18th, the violent Japanese invaded our three northeastern provinces. The Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association collected the aforementioned fund until September 25th. After that, Japanese yarn was boycotted entirely. However, the fund collected has not yet reached one million taels, and should be retained as planned. Recently, the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association changed the proposal to establish a yarn sizing factory. After the announcement was issued, manufacturers in Su, Chang, Cheng, and Xi unanimously expressed their opposition. The other day, the Dyeing and Weaving Association of the four counties of Cheng, Xi, Wu, and Yu sent a letter to the Jiangyin Factory Cloth Guild, seeking their opinion, and also replied expressing unanimous opposition.</p>
<p>Villagers Falsely Claim to be Zhang Jingjiang's Brother-in-Law. Guo Xingbao, a farmer from the Sanduan Village in Yangku Town, is a Catholic. His younger sister was sold to a Zhang family in Nanxun, Zhejiang Province, as a concubine. Guo deceives the ignorant villagers in the countryside, falsely claiming that Zhang Jingjiang, an important figure in the Party and the state, is his sister's husband. Ignorant villagers believe it to be true. Recently, he illegally gathered a society and named it "Yitou." Yesterday (the 7th), Guo Shengxing, a member of the Education Association of the village, and Xu Dianren, a member of the Education Association, jointly reported to the county. Guo was arrested and brought to the county, where Magistrate Ma personally interrogated him. Guo strongly argued that the allegations were all false accusations driven by personal grudges. The court ordered him to be released on bail.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Meeting to Discuss the Silk Reeling Industry Labor Dispute. Workers from the Zhenjiang silk reeling industry union, because the factory had received debt maintenance funds but delayed the start of work, cutting off the workers' livelihoods, gathered at the Chamber of Commerce the other day to petition, requesting that a way be found to maintain their jobs, and refused to disperse. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau Inspector Xu persuaded them and promised to find a solution, and they dispersed. It is reported that the Public Security Bureau has sent letters to the County Party Department, the County Government, and the Silk Reeling Industry Union to hold a meeting today to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Forgery of Recommendation Letter Leads to Court Investigation. Since the news of the dismissal of Li Zonggang, the chief of the Public Security Bureau of Wujin County, spread, those waiting for appointment were eager to get the position. Chen Xiaowu, a Guangdong native who had previously passed the qualification examination with the eleventh rank, had the audacity to forge a recommendation letter from Lei Xiaocen, an advisor to the Ministry of Interior, and presented it to Director Hu of the Civil Affairs Department, requesting to be immediately appointed as the chief of the Public Security Bureau of Wujin County. Later, Hu replied to Advisor Lei, saying that the chief of the Public Security Bureau of Wujin County had already been transferred from Fang Weizhou, the chief of the Public Security Bureau of Taicang County, which was contrary to Lei's intention, hoping to be forgiven. Lei was deeply surprised after receiving the letter and immediately wrote to Director Hu, stating that he had never issued a letter of introduction, asking him to pay attention. Unexpectedly, Chen suddenly brought a second letter in the name of Lei Xiaocen to the department, the content of which was to ask to find a way to arrange an early appointment. In order to be cautious, Director Hu sent Inspector Lu Yonghuang to visit Lei in Beijing with Chen's letter. After verification, it was proven that Chen had indeed borrowed a name and forged a private seal. Lu immediately returned and reported. Director Hu then issued a handwritten order yesterday to Shen Jianhao, the commander of the Special Service Battalion of the Security Department, to arrest Chen at his address and temporarily hand him over to the guard for custody. At the same time, he prepared an official letter, along with the evidence, and escorted him to the Zhenjiang Local Court for detention and investigation.</p>
<p>Magistrate of Taicang County Accused. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has previously received a report from Yang Gang and others, the director of the slaughter tax office in Taicang County, accusing Wu Deyao, the magistrate of the county, of abusing his power due to personal grudges, unlawfully arresting people, and acting illegally. They requested that he be handed over to the court for punishment according to the law. They also accused Shen Yan, the director of the Education Bureau of the county, of deliberately trying to evade responsibility and fleeing his post, requesting that the county be ordered to detain him pending judicial trial, in order to warn officials against evil and avoid injustice. After reviewing the case, the Provincial Government considered that the case was of great importance and had yesterday consulted the Jiangsu High Court for verification.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Zhang Jian's Property Unsealed and Returned. The arrest warrant for Zhang Jian has been revoked, and his confiscated property has been fully returned.

<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Sanke Tree Town Robbed by Bandits. Sanke Tree Town, forty miles away from Huaiyin County, is near Siyang and is often disturbed by bandits. Last autumn, the town was occupied by bandits for many days, and the area was in a state of ruin. A year has passed, but it has not yet recovered. Suddenly, on the afternoon of the fourth day of the previous month, around 11 PM, more than sixty bandits attacked and broke through the town again, looting extensively and setting fire to the streets, burning down more than thirty houses of residents and merchants. They retreated at 2 AM on the 5th. More than twenty local people were kidnapped. However, they released all the hostages on the way, taking only the young owner of Hengchang away.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Cables to Retain Zhejiang University President Shao</h3>
<p>▲Shao Cables Again Requesting Resignation</p>
<p>Zhejiang University experienced a disturbance on the 4th of this month. President Shao Feizi telegraphed the Ministry of Education that evening to resign from his post. This was reported in this newspaper. We now know that the Ministry of Education replied on the 6th, urging him to overcome the difficulties and not consider resigning, and to investigate and punish the students who caused the trouble. However, Shao's determination to resign is firm. Yesterday, he telegraphed the Ministry of Education again to resign. The telegram is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Ministry of Education's telegram to Shao, President of Zhejiang University: Received your telegram. The students who caused the trouble on that day should be investigated and punished as soon as possible. The affairs of Zhejiang University are important. It is hoped that you will overcome the difficulties and not consider resigning. Ministry of Education [seal].</p>
<p>▲Shao Feizi's telegram to the Ministry of Education in Nanjing: Received your telegram, instructing me to continue in my position and to investigate and punish the students who caused the trouble. I should comply with your instructions. However, I am of low ability and cannot fulfill the Ministry's intention to rectify the academic atmosphere. Previously, Dean Li of the College of Engineering submitted his resignation, taking responsibility for inadequate management and training. I had already telegraphed the Ministry to resign and stated that I would no longer perform the duties of the president from that day on, and could not accept his resignation. The original submission was returned. Regarding the reasons for the telegram, in addition to being copied and sent to the various colleges by the Secretariat, I earnestly request that my resignation be approved immediately and that someone be selected to take over as soon as possible. Shao Feizi presents respectfully.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Orders Counties and Cities to Abolish Two Types of Education Committees</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department previously resolved to abolish various education committees in counties and cities in the province at the Provincial Local Education Administration Conference. After investigation, there are currently seven types of education committees established in various counties and cities in the province: (1) County and City Education Committees, (2) County and City Education Property Management Committees, (3) County and City Compulsory Education Committees, (4) County and City Mass Education Committees, (5) County and City Literacy Campaign Promotion Committees, (6) Phonetic Symbol Promotion Committees, and (7) County and City Education Economic Audit Committees. After further review, it was decided that: A. Since the County and City Education Committees are responsible for reviewing the guidelines and plans for education in the counties and cities, all matters related to mass education and compulsory education can be reviewed by this committee. B. The Literacy Campaign Promotion Committees and the Phonetic Symbol Promotion Committees are temporary in nature. The latter should be abolished, and the County Education Bureaus and City Education Sections should be responsible for handling their affairs. C. The County Education Property Management Committees and the County and City Education Economic Audit Committees should remain as they are. A special document was prepared to be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval. The Ministry of Education has now approved, stating that the Phonetic Symbol Promotion Committees have already been ordered to be followed by all provinces and cities and should not be abolished alone. The rest are approved as proposed. An order was issued to all counties yesterday to comply with this.</p>

<h3>Group of Students Returned from Japan to Petition in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) A group of students returned from Japan held an emergency meeting at the office of the Jinrong Bank side YMCA yesterday at 9:00 AM. They decided to go to Nanjing on the 12th to petition in order to achieve the goal of completing their studies. The previous representatives who went to Beijing to petition requested the Ministry of Education to provide appropriate measures for them to continue their studies. It was agreed that a special class would be set up at the Army University in Beiping for the 23rd class of students, and the 24th class of students would be assigned to the 8th class of the Central Military Academy. However, the preparation of the special class will take time and the training will not begin until December, and the level of the class is also quite different. Therefore, after the meeting, it was decided to go to Nanjing on the 12th to petition. Two representatives were sent to Nanjing last night to find a place to stay and to provide financial assistance. More than ten students went to Beiping to visit Vice Chairman Zhang to request an appropriate educational institution. Zhang said that he needed to consult the central government before deciding on a solution. The representatives are actively engaged in anti-Japanese propaganda in Beiping. The group's "Avant-Garde" tri-weekly publication is also ready and will be moved to Beijing for publication.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Middle School Invites Feng Yong and Others to Give Lectures</h3>

Yesterday (the 9th), when the senior high school held a memorial week, it specially invited Feng Yong, the commander-in-chief of the group, to give a lecture. Feng described in detail the Japanese soldiers' atrocities in forcibly occupying the Northeast and the fact that our country's strength was weak and unable to resist. He also encouraged the youth to be down-to-earth, prepare earnestly, and not engage in empty talk on paper. Subsequently, Wang Huayi, a commander of the group, gave a lecture. He elaborated in detail on his feelings about the League of Nations and the Peace Conference, and the preparations that young people should make. During the junior high school's memorial week, Mei Foguang, a commander of the group, was invited to give a lecture on the causes and circumstances of the Northeast tragedy and the points we should strive for in the future.

<h3>Chinese Women's Sports School Practices Battlefield Nursing</h3>
<p>The entire student body of the Chinese Women's Sports School is practicing battlefield nursing. The textbooks were selected by Wang Peiyuan, the medical director of the Red Cross Society, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, Wang brought the rescue equipment and supplies used by the association in the Henan battlefield last year to the school's grassy field, gathered all the students, and assumed that a student was injured. He instructed them one by one on the use of instruments and various operations for about three hours. According to Wang, the students' performance is competent for battlefield nursing. However, the school environment is ultimately different from the battlefield. It is still necessary to take them to the field and assume a field hospital to practice in order to develop the same ability as the Red Cross Society's rescuers. In the future, when providing on-site rescue, the students of the school can cooperate with the Red Cross rescue team.</p>

<h3>Vocational Guidance Center Amid National Crisis</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center has recently seen a surge in requests for talent as all sectors are united in economic disengagement from Japan, and factories producing goods from other countries are eagerly seeking to expand to compensate. The center receives multiple commissions daily to find talent, and they deeply feel the difficulty in finding specialists. This is truly a result of the general populace of students devoting themselves to inconsequential subjects, while neglecting applied sciences. The center, standing on the grounds of vocational guidance, cannot remain silent. They will soon publish a statement to the youth, based on their years of experience and assessment of society's current needs, to guide young people on their path of learning and research, as a fundamental effort to resist Japanese goods and promote national goods. Yesterday, a dyeing company in a certain county in Zhejiang entrusted the center to find a dyeing technician, who must have experience in washing woolen cloth, broadcloth, leather goods, and straw hats, and be able to dye various skillfully colored silk clothing pieces to be qualified. A certain rock candy factory in Zhejiang entrusted the center to hire a manufacturing technician, with a monthly salary of around eighty yuan. A certain hospital in Zhejiang entrusted the center to hire a female pediatrician specializing in obstetrics and gynecology, who must be a graduate of a Chinese medicine specialty school and have experience, with a monthly salary of twenty yuan, including board and lodging. A certain large factory in the local area entrusted the center to hire a salesperson, who must be fluent in English and have experience in selling silk fabrics to be qualified. A certain farm entrusted the center to hire an agricultural technician, who is proficient in farm management and has rich experience to be qualified, with salary to be discussed in person. Those who are willing to apply can contact the center in person at No. 80 Hualong Road. Furthermore, the center's ninety-two-month specialist recommendation forms have also been sent to various industrial, commercial, educational institutions for the selection of talent at any time. If any institutions need these recommendation forms, they can write to the center, and they will be sent immediately.</p>

<h3>French Lawn Tennis Association Officially Announces World's Top Ten Tennis Players</h3>
<p>Paris, 10th - The French Lawn Tennis Association officially announced today in the Paris newspapers the top ten tennis players in the world. Cochet remains in first place, and the 19-year-old American Vines is second. In total, the United States occupies five spots, England and France two each, and Japan one. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>1st Cochet (France) 2nd Vines (USA)</p>
<p>3rd Perry (England) 4th Austin (England)</p>
<p>5th Shields (USA) 6th Wood (USA)</p>
<p>7th Borotra (France) 8th Jiro Sato (Japan)</p>
<p>9th Van Ryn (USA) 10th Lott (USA)</p>
<p>Below them are Menzel (Czechoslovakia), Boussus (France), Doeg (USA), Hughes (England), and Tilden (Italy).</p>
<p>▲The ranking, with Vines listed in second place, is largely due to his special performance in the U.S. Open. Although Vines did not participate in this year's Wimbledon and Davis Cup, opinions differ on Perry and Austin above Shields and Wood. This can be explained as follows: Although Shields and Wood won the Wimbledon finals, Shields completely lost his form in the England-America Davis Cup inter-zone final in Paris. Although he beat Perry, he ultimately lost to Austin. Although Wood defeated Perry and Hughes at Wimbledon, he lost both matches in the Davis Cup inter-zone final, once to Austin and again to Perry. He also lost to Perry in Newport. Borotra's decline this season is undeniable, but he is still a formidable force in indoor matches, so he remains in the top ten.</p>

<h3>Memories of a Tortoiseshell Beam</h3>
<p>— Swallow</p>
<p>▲The Heroic Death of Zuo Baogui</p>
<p>In the Battle of Pyongyang, Zuo Baogui defended the West Gate alone with one army against the enemy's entire division. (Zuo, as a registered admiral with a yellow riding jacket, double-eyed peacock feather, and double-numbered Baturu title, was subordinate to Ye Zhichao). At that time, Wei Rugui fled first, and Ye also fled after. Nie Gongting fought and retreated, losing only a limited amount. When Zuo heard of this, his hair stood on end and split. He waved a red flag and personally supervised the battle. Japanese troops attacked from all sides, and bullets rained down. Zuo's double-eyed peacock feather was burned by artillery shells, leaving only the feather shaft, which was still burning as he fired on the enemy, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers. After a day and night of bitter fighting, more than half of his troops were lost. A certain officer tried to persuade Zuo to retreat to plan for another attempt. Zuo drew his saber, cut a piece of his clothing hem, and told the crowd, "Today's matter, anyone who retreats will be like this hem." Looking back at his subordinates, only three hundred or so people remained, and an enemy bullet flew and hit his left arm. Zuo did not move, suppressed the wound, and fought again. He took the lead, killing dozens of Japanese chiefs with his bare hands. The enemy troops gathered more and more, and Zuo glared and shouted, charging into the battle and being struck by bullets in the abdomen and back. His horse died, and Zuo also fell. Under the anger of his subordinates, each fought as if they were a hundred men. When the ammunition ran out, the entire army was wiped out. Only four or five people escaped back, recounting the tragic scene of his death. Everyone who heard it could not help but shed tears. He can be compared to Deng Shichang of the Navy, who died one after the other. Alas.</p>
<p>Don't Remove the Weeds in the Courtyard - A Collection of Husband's Talks</p>
<h3>At the Lunch Table</h3>
<p>Do you study Buddhism? Why don't you eat meat?</p>
<p>I have no inventions, cannot work, and make no contribution to society. I am already ashamed to be a parasite. If I were to eat meat, harm their lives, and support this useless person, that would be even more unthinkable.</p>
<p>According to what you say, none of us should eat meat. Who has inventions? Who can work? Who deserves beef?</p>
<p>Correct! All of us useless eaters should simply be vegetarians. Perhaps only Auntie Min, who carries water and cooks, deserves to eat meat!</p>
<p>Good! Let's give all the meat dishes to Auntie Min to eat!</p>
<p>Does Auntie Jin, who carries the child, deserve to eat meat? Since Auntie Min has meat to eat, it seems unfair to be partial.</p>
<p>That depends on who Auntie Jin is carrying the child for. If the child's mother is a worker in a scientific laboratory or a female worker in a yarn factory, then Auntie Jin is helping someone invent or work, and she deserves our gifts. If the child's mother hires Auntie Jin to carry the child so that she can go out to play cards or be comfortable at home, then Auntie Jin is a helper, not a helper, and she is not worthy of eating meat like us.</p>
<p>You say that laborers deserve to eat meat, but in this unequal society, laborers cannot afford to buy meat dishes.</p>
<p>As long as the elite idlers, scholars, masters, wives, young ladies, hooligans, and all those who cannot invent and cannot work are only allowed to be vegetarians, then they will naturally have meat to eat.</p>
<p>This is not thorough enough! Invention and labor are individual contributions to humanity. What does that have to do with animals? It is not necessarily fair to take the lives of cows, sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, and fish to repay their merits.</p>
<p>Good, let's all be vegetarians!</p>
<h3>The Enemy Tower for Defending Against the Japanese Pirates in Pingwang</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Pingwang is a small town belonging to Wujiang County, about forty-odd li from the city. Yingdu Lake nearby is especially a famous scenic area. In the past, when I bought a boat to tour Yuhang, I passed by here at dusk. The misty smoke and water made it difficult to distinguish. A few years ago, I went to Lihuali for business. On the way back, I went from Lihuali to Pingwang, and then from Pingwang I took a ferry to Jiahe. Lihuali is only twelve li away from Pingwang by water. While waiting for the boat, I stayed on the wharf for about an hour, allowing me to appreciate the scenery of the place. The market street is extremely short, and the residents are mostly simple and unadorned. However, there are many monasteries, and the prevalence of superstition is remarkable here. Because it is near the water, it is rich in fish, shrimp, water chestnuts, and gorgon fruits. I also heard that there is a kind of red shrimp produced under a certain bridge, with red body and dragon-like whiskers, different from ordinary ones. It is said that crossing the bridge will not find it. It is said that immortals cooked shrimp with wine, became drunk, and spat under the bridge, which then turned into a different species. This is a preposterous talk and not credible. During the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, Japanese pirates invaded our borders. Yang Zhi, a local official, was worried about it. He gathered workers to build an enemy tower north of the Elder Bridge. When the pirates disturbed Pingwang, Yang Zhi personally led local soldiers and civilians to defend it from the enemy tower. Arrows and stones rained down, and the Japanese general Matsumura Yoshishi was killed. The remaining pirates retreated down the boats, raised their sails, and fled. Yang Zhi pursued them and overturned countless boats. The spirit of the Japanese pirates was greatly frustrated. As times changed, the enemy tower gradually collapsed. Today, only a few zhang of stone foundation remain. Copper camels and brambles make one feel sentimental without even visiting the Luoyang Palace Gate.</p>
<h3>World Short Chronicle</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>The First Automobile. The history of the automobile is almost a century old. Recently, Austria held a centennial celebration for the creator of the first automobile. This creator was named Siegfried Marcus. People in Central Europe generally say that he was truly the first contributor to the creation of the automobile. His first automobile was created in 1864. At that time, it used oil. In the early stages of its creation, of course, there were many imperfections. He put in a lot of research and greatly improved it, and in 1875 he created a better automobile. This car is still preserved in the capital city of Vienna for observation. However, Marcus's car was lacking in many mechanical aspects and could not propel itself. One hundred and twenty-eight years ago, an English inventor, R. Trevithick, created a steam car and drove it through the streets of London. For a long time, this steam car was very popular and competed fiercely with trains. Automobiles can now be seen almost everywhere in the modern world, but to trace its origins, one must give credit to Marcus and Trevithick.</p>

<p>General Wu Ziyu, who dreamed of unifying the country by force, suffered a setback at Yuguan and a second defeat at Wuhan. He has been living in seclusion in Sichuan for several years, under the protection of Sichuan generals Yang Sen and Deng Xihou, and has long been forgotten by the world. Recently, with the rampant violence of the Japanese, seizing our Northeast, killing our compatriots, and destroying our construction, all those with a little hot blood are filled with indignation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to plan for national unity to jointly resist foreign aggression, and to concentrate diplomatic and military talents to work together to save the country from the storms. Thus, there is a rumor that Wu is being brought back into service. However, the roads are far, and news of Wu is occasionally found in the newspapers, but ultimately, the details cannot be known. Yesterday, a guest came from Shaanxi. Shaanxi and Sichuan are close neighbors. He spoke very detailedly about Wu's situation, saying that Wu had been in seclusion in Sichuan for a long time, and his ambition had never ceased for a day, only that the time had not come. In August, there was a coup in Gansu. Chairman Ma Hongbin was detained by Lei Zhongtian and Ma Wenche. The political power in Gansu was concentrated in the hands of Lei and Ma. Lei then sent troops to attack Ma Tingxian's troops in Longnan, hoping to confiscate Ma's weapons to strengthen his forces. Ma was no match and retreated, gathering on the Sichuan border. Knowing that Wu's reputation was very prominent, he wanted to gather Wu to rally support. He sent an envoy to welcome Wu. Wu thought that this was the opportunity to mediate the Gansu situation and went to Wudu in the name of Commander-in-Chief of the Anguo Army to mediate the dispute between Ma and Lei. On one hand, he united Deng Xihou and Yang Sen in Sichuan as a backing. However, among the Gansu generals, in addition to Lei Zhongtian, there were also Lu Dachang and Chen Zhanggui, two divisions with strong forces, who obeyed Yang Hucheng, the director of the Northwest Appeasement Headquarters. Lei did not dare to openly oppose the Central Government because Lu and Chen sincerely obeyed Yang. Wu had not received an order from the Central Government, so he could not be considered official. Lu and Chen rejected Wu's envoy without comment. Thus, Wu could not immediately go to Lanzhou and only ordered Bai Jianwu to persuade Ma Lin of Qinghai and Lei, Lu, and Chen not to meet each other with force and to seek compromise conditions. However, no substantial progress has been made to date. Therefore, Wu is only staying in Wudu and has not entered Lanzhou. Wu's subordinates have been scattered. Those who went to Wudu this time were only the guards led by Bai Jianwu, more than 600 people. These 600-odd people have never left Wu since Wu entered Sichuan, because they share the same joys and sorrows with Wu.</p>
<h3>The Necessary Understanding of Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation</h3>
<p>— En Pu</p>
<p>(1) Resisting Japan and saving the nation is a painstaking and arduous task. It is definitely not a fashionable act.</p>
<p>(2) Resisting Japan and saving the nation is a righteous and urgent act of self-defense. It is definitely not an anti-foreign, quarrelsome, sneaky, and petty act.</p>
<p>(3) Resisting Japan and saving the nation is my personal duty. I should lead by example and be a guide for others.</p>
<p>(4) Persuading people to resist Japan and save the nation is my personal responsibility. If people do not listen, it is their fault. I must not stop my work of persuasion because people do not listen.</p>
<p>(5) If people do not resist Japan and save the nation, it is their sin. Since I recognize resisting Japan and saving the nation as a legitimate act, I must not be discouraged or stop my work because of their sins.</p>
<p>(6) Teaching others how to resist Japan and save the nation is the highest public virtue, a benevolent act of saving people from fire and water.</p>
<p>(7) Asking people to teach me how to resist Japan and save the nation is a clever plan to gather wisdom and benefit. It is the best way to avenge and redress grievances, and it is definitely not an expression that I am inferior to others and willingly show weakness.</p>
<p>(8) Resisting Japan and saving the nation by outwardly complying but inwardly opposing is a suicidal policy and a great farce that makes foreign countries laugh.</p>
<p>(9) Resisting Japan and saving the nation requires long-term and patient perseverance. Five minutes of enthusiasm is in vain.</p>
<p>(10) Resisting Japan and saving the nation requires a spirit of great fearlessness. No external force can overwhelm my inner resistance to Japan and saving the nation.</p>
<p>(11) Boycotting Japanese goods and not cooperating with them is the most peaceful, easiest, and most effective way to resist Japan and save the nation.</p>
<p>(12) Implementing a conscription system to strengthen the physique and implementing compulsory vocational education to popularize mass education are the supreme national salvation policies.</p>
<h3>My Business Talk (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>In the past two months, entrepreneurs who want to save the country and seek to benefit both themselves and others have asked me to plan and design for them. It can be said to be extremely prosperous for a while. However, I believe that no matter what kind of business, if its capital is limited, it will often run out of steam halfway and fall down. It is very dangerous. For example, it is not difficult to make a small industrial product with a capital of several thousand. However, to sell it in the market, there are three key elements. First, buyers should be able to buy it cheaply and everywhere. Then, it must be widely distributed. If each distributor is given an account of 50 yuan and the cost is 70 percent, then at least 100 companies will need 3,500 yuan. Second, buyers need to know where the goods are sold, which requires advertising. Assuming 20 short lines, each line costing 4.5 jiao, it will cost 9 yuan a day. Publishing in the Shen and Xin newspapers every other day will cost a monthly fee of 270 yuan. At least 500 yuan must be prepared. Third, if the inventory and raw materials are insufficient, then the supply will not meet the demand, which is a major blow. It is like a war, and if the bullets are insufficient, then you cannot advance to attack or retreat to defend, and defeat is inevitable. Therefore, if there are 5,000 yuan of goods in the account, 5,000 yuan of raw materials must be prepared to meet immediate needs, so that they can be turned around and circulated without missing the opportunity. As mentioned above, the fund must be at least 10,000 yuan. The advertising fee is taken from 5 percent of the selling price, which means that at least 10,000 yuan of goods must be sold per month. With a capital of 10,000 yuan, to do 120,000 yuan of business a year, unless it is a store that sells, greets guests at the front door, and receives goods at the back door, those who are good at long-sleeved dancing may still be possible. If it is called a factory, then it is absolutely impossible. The capital of a factory is at least three times: one in the account, one in hand, and one in the warehouse and on the way. Therefore, with a capital of 10,000 yuan, it can only do 20,000 yuan of business a year. At a profit of 30 percent, it is only 6,000 yuan. With 3,000 yuan for advertising, only 3,000 yuan is left. Whether it is enough to cover the expenses, it is not necessary to consult the divination to know. Therefore, I am willing to offer a word of advice based on the principle of being loyal to those who seek advice. Those who want to start a small industry with thousands of gold are better off forming a company and becoming shareholders than doing a one-man show and being stretched everywhere. It is more stable. For example, if you organize a company of 100,000 yuan, the budget is still as above, then you can get thousands of distributors, and you can prepare the needs of thousands of families for inventory and raw materials. But the advertising cost is still only 3,000. With 1,000 distributors, the sales will definitely be ten times wider, and the productivity will also increase ten times.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Novel</p>
<h3>A Villager Arrives in Shanghai Again (12)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>At that time, the villagers, along with the passengers in the third-class car, squeezed out of the small train door like a tide. Although he strongly argued that the military band was welcoming the bride, he actually knew that it must be coming to welcome some rich people. He thought to himself: being rich is really prestigious. Even that group of friends who were eating wedding feasts – whom they called the army – had a decent enough pose.</p>
<p>He didn't bother to investigate whether the soldiers were there to pick up the rice planting committee or the vegetable picking staff. He stumbled out of the train station, first needing to set a direction. Where to go now?</p>
<p>He had a nephew who had a job in Shanghai. That nephew's surname was Lin, and everyone called him Amu Lin. This was teased out by many friends. It is easiest to give people nicknames in Shanghai. It's really one spreads to ten, ten spreads to a hundred. You call, I call, and later it makes it impossible for the person himself to deny it. In fact, it is not surprising that Shanghai addresses people with the word "A". Things like Brother Ade, Brother A Lin, Li Agui, Zhang Agen, and the like are also commonly seen.</p>
<p>"Uncle! It's good that you came to Shanghai to find me, and you can just stay at my place. It doesn't matter." His nephew had said those words to him when he went to the countryside.</p>
<p>"I don't recognize your place, those newly emerging roads in Shanghai, twisting tongues, are hard to remember. What oiled cloth road, wet shirt road, and also Malandang road, more troublesome than reading foreign books." The villager said so.</p>
<p>"The place I live in is easiest to remember. There is a singer named Mei Lanfang, you always know him, right?"</p>
<p>"How could I not know! Even a three-year-old child knows him. I've even seen his photos." The villager again pretended to be an old hand.</p>
<p>"Then I'll tell you! The place I live in is called Meilanfang. The lane houses in Shanghai are all what fang, what li. Meilanfang and Mei Lanfang have the same sound, but the word fang and the word fang are written differently. But when you get to the French Concession, it's easier to ask for Meilanfang. To be honest, I was originally assigned to watch the lane in Fuzhifang. When Fuzhifang is mentioned, some people don't know it very well, but Meilanfang is easier to remember."</p>
<p>"You don't need to remind me, I know all about Mei Lanfang, he is now asking someone to be a matchmaker."</p>
<p>"How do you ask someone to be a matchmaker? I don't know."</p>
<p>"That's right, he has already given his eight characters."</p>
<p>"Haha! I'm afraid you're wrong again, old man. He recently got a doctorate, not gave his eight characters."</p>

<h3>Financial - Gold Price Plunges Unceasingly</h3>
<p>▲ Further Devastating Drop of 27.4 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold auction witnessed a horrifying crash approaching 600 taels, with the market in an extremely chaotic state, changing in an instant. The tempestuous volatility caused panic among dealers, with fluctuations of five or six taels occurring frequently. The overall market saw a difference of twenty-four taels. Ultimately, the price plummeted by as much as twenty-seven or twenty-eight taels. This was due to the divergent trend in the silver market and, more significantly, to news that the League of Nations would impose severe sanctions on Japan. The League was reportedly determined to invoke Article 15 of the Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, considering recalling its ambassador to Japan and imposing an economic blockade. Consequently, many long positions and arbitrageurs had no choice but to sell off in order to prevent further declines and potentially unmanageable losses, especially given the substantial advances extended. As a result, the market opened already below 630 taels, with the downward trend intensifying thereafter. The abnormal weakness of foreign exchange also benefited short sellers, who actively covered their positions. The market price hovered around 610 taels, with the outlook even more frightening. Rumors of a tense situation in Tianjin circulated, along with speculation that the Japanese might withdraw from the League of Nations, further depressing market sentiment. The increasingly loose exchange rate created a sense of being besieged on all sides ("songs of Chu on four sides"), causing a sudden drop to a new low below 605 taels. Further short selling by major players then pushed the price below that level by more than ten taels.</p>
<p>▲ Morning Market Already in a Precarious Situation. The market opened 16.4 mace lower at 624 taels (private deals had gone as low as 30 taels). The Dalian group was the first to sell. The large silver firms reported that the silver telegrams from the previous day had fallen by 16.5 points, but silver prices had risen by 8.3 points. Due to the unfavorable situation, this escalated to 28 taels. In an instant, Zhi Feng, Yong Yuan Mao, Yong Yuan Cheng, Yong Tong, Tai Chang, Zhen Chang Xiang, and others dumped their holdings, causing a further drop to 10.3 mace. Shortly after, it rose to 17 taels as Da De Cheng, Yu Da, and others covered their positions. However, the situation remained unfavorable, leading to another downturn to 11.5 taels. Simultaneously, the foreign exchange market hardened. Banks were buying near-term U.S. dollars at 35.5 yuan and far-term dollars at 35.875 to 35.9375. When British gold was quoted, it rose to 17 taels but remained unchanged. The U.S. dollar was extended by .25, then returned to 16 taels, a rapid increase of 18.5 taels. The cashiers of different firms moved in different directions. At 9:45 a.m., there were fluctuations of two or three taels. HSBC offered one-month British gold at 10 5/8 pence. Ying Tong entered two-month gold at the same price. Subsequently, Zhi Feng, Yong Da Xing, Yong Yuan Cheng, Fu Chang Shun Li, Wan Xing, and arbitrageurs in the U.S. dollar market heavily sold off, causing the price to plummet by 10 taels, reaching 608.5 taels at 10:15 a.m. Later, McGalliard absorbed two-month British gold at .625, and HSBC absorbed three-month U.S. dollars at 36.125 yuan, as well as near-term gold at 36 yuan. Da De Cheng, Heng Xing, Yi Feng, Yong Yuan Mao, Yong Heng Chang Yong, and others successively bought in, pushing the price up by six or seven taels, reaching 15 taels at 10:45 a.m. Afterward, the selling pressure continued, and the price fell again to 608.5 taels. After 11:15 a.m., the market became unpredictable, with fluctuations of four or five taels in an instant, reaching 16 taels by 11:30 a.m. Retail investors chased the price upwards, then weakened. The Indian exchange rate reported a large drop of one rupee and two annas, so the noon close was 12 taels, again reaching 10 taels, and finally 13 or 14 taels. People were extremely confused, and the listed price was changed to 609.67 taels, with an estimated squeeze of around 80 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Besieged on All Sides in the Afternoon. The afternoon market opened weakly at 609 taels, then 612 taels. The Dalian group and Yuan Mao, Yi Feng, and others vigorously sold off. Reports that the riots in Tianjin were becoming more severe circulated, along with rumors that the "dwarf bandits" (Japanese) would withdraw from the League of Nations, causing panic and a drop of 8 taels, ultimately reaching a new low of 604 taels. British gold lengthened to 10 3/4 pence. Before long, Heng Xing, Zhi Feng, Yong and speculators entered the market, causing an upward trend. From 2:10 p.m. to 2:30 p.m., there were fluctuations of four or five taels. Afterwards, Fu Chang, Yuan Heng Shun Li, Da De Cheng, and others took advantage of this to buy in, jumping ten taels, but the foreign exchange market remained flat. At 3:15 p.m., it was 14.8 taels. Subsequently, Da De Cheng, Yi Feng, Zhi Feng, Yong Fu Chang, and others all sold, but it still could not be sustained, and dropped by eight or nine taels, reaching 606 taels at 3:50 p.m. Later, because HSBC and Da Tong were trading one-month U.S. dollars at 36.1875, Zhi Feng, Yong, and retail investors came in again, so at 4:15 p.m., it was 13.5 taels, but retreated to 11 taels shortly after. The Dalian group also sold. By the time the market closed at 4:30 p.m., it had risen again to 13 taels, a devastating drop of 27.4 taels compared to last week. After the market closed, it was re-traded at 11 or 12 taels. Goods and others came out. According to statistics, the largest fluctuation of the day was 28 taels, and the smallest was 604 taels, a difference of 24 taels. The price of goods in the early market was 26.5 taels, the noon close was 12.5 taels, the afternoon was 608.5 taels, and the closing price was 611.5 taels. The quoted price was estimated to be between 90 taels and 83 or 84 taels, with an overnight interest payment of 12 taels and an afternoon interest payment of 13 taels, adding 9 taels to the "red tape" (brokerage fees).</p>
<p>▲ Extremely Complex Speculation. The trading on the table was complex. According to statistics, Yuan Mao Yong, Yi Feng Yong, Heng Xing, Yi Feng, Yu Da, Heng Chang Yong, Fu Tai Heng, Bing Xing, and retail short sellers all bought in. Shun Li, Wan Xing, Da De Cheng, Tong Tai Chang, Zhi Feng Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Fu Chang, Zhen Chang Xiang, Heng Yu, Ju Chang, Sen Chang Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong, Cui Chang Yong, Yuan Cheng all sold. Foreign exchange arbitrageurs sold, and Da Xing Yong also sold. Yuan Tai, Yuan Da Yong, Fu Yu, and Hong Kang Yong had inconsistent in and out flows. In the afternoon, Zhi Feng Yong, Tian Feng Yong, Heng Xing, Yi Feng Yong, Tai Feng Yong, and Tai Feng Cheng all bought in. Wan Xing, Shun Li, Yuan Mao Yong, Yi Feng, Fu Tai Heng, and Heng Chang Yong all sold. Da De Cheng, Yuan Tai, Yuan Chun, Tian Xiang, Yuan Xing Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, and Tong Tai Chang had occasional ups and downs. Speculator Mr. Wu went short and then long. The Dalian group sold a total of 7,000 long positions and bought 2,000 strips. The Guangdong group sold 1,000 and bought 2,000.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Trends Extremely Loose</h3>
<p>▲ Chinese Merchants' Arbitrage Losses Are Enormous</p>
<p>Yesterday's HSBC quotations saw slight changes. British gold remained the same as before. Due to the divergent trend of British gold falling and U.S. dollars rising the day before, U.S. dollars lengthened by .25 to 34.5 yuan, French francs shrank by 11 yuan, German exchange added 2 marks, and Hong Kong reduced by .125 to 75.75 taels. The rest remained unchanged. The internal market trends of the banks were extremely loose. The League of Nations will take strict measures against Japan, intending to impose an economic blockade, which led to an alarming drop in the gold market. As a result, compared to last Saturday, British gold lengthened by .75 and U.S. dollars lengthened by 1.12 yuan. Gold businesses were still selling, totaling more than 200,000 pounds of British gold and one million U.S. dollars. Banks were able to accommodate it. However, the arbitrage positions previously taken by Chinese merchants, which involved selling foreign exchange and buying "strips," were severely impacted, resulting in huge losses. Therefore, they had no choice but to sell gold alone, resulting in an arbitrage spread of more than 50 taels, a difference of 20 or 30 taels compared to before.</p>
<p>▲ British Exchange Internal Market Has a 5.625 Difference. The early market offered prices of approximately 1 shilling and 10.125 pence, with a buying price of 1.875 pence. HSBC offered one-month at .625, and the British East Asia Company entered one-two months at the same price. Subsequently, Shanghai Xingye sold one-month at 5.625 to Zhongnan. McGalliard entered two-month at .625. HSBC and the Bank of China mutually traded three-month at .625. The noon close offered prices from .625 to 5.625, with buying prices from 6.875 to .625. In the afternoon, McGalliard entered one-month at .75. Hua Bi and Sumitomo mutually traded two-month at 6.875. HSBC entered four-month at 6.875. The closing offered prices were 6.875 to .625, with buying prices of .75 to 6.875.</p>
<p>▲ U.S. Exchange Internal Market Has a 9.375 Rotation. The early market offered prices of approximately 35.25 yuan, with a buying price of .375. Mitsui entered spot at 35.5 yuan. Hua Bi entered three-month at 9.375. Taiwan entered two-month at .875. HSBC entered .875, and also entered three-month with McGalliard at .875. HSBC entered one-month at 36.0625 yuan, and also three-month at .125, and also entered November at 36 yuan. Mei Feng and McGalliard made a deal of one-month at 36.0625 yuan. McGalliard offered 36 yuan. The noon close offered prices from 36 yuan to .0625, with buying prices from .0625 to .125. In the afternoon, McGalliard and Da Tong entered two-three months at .1875 to .25. Hua Bi entered two-month at .1875. HSBC entered .3125, and also traded with Da Tong at .25. HSBC entered one-month at .3125. An Da and Hua Bi traded one-month at .25. HSBC and Da Tong again made a deal of one-month at .1875. HSBC again entered 36.25 yuan. The closing offered prices were 35.9375 to 36 yuan, with buying prices from 36.0625 to .125. The official exchange rate for U.S. dollars was 2 taels, 8 mace, 9 fen, 8 hao, 5 si per dollar.</p>
<h3>Clearing Rate Again Trends High</h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview: Although the critical period for the financial sector has passed, in reality, the vitality has been damaged and has not recovered. Therefore, any slight disturbance will cause significant fluctuations. There were several changes last week, but the decline was still slight, so there was no special phenomenon. Yesterday, when the banks opened, the initial funding was still insufficient, and the clearing funds were still lacking, causing the market situation to appear tight again. However, due to the high demand and low supply of foreign "clearing taels," it was also slightly affected by the rising prices.</p>
<p>▲ Clearing Rate Prices: "Foreign Clearing Taels" The market was slightly firm in the early market, and the market price increased to 7 mace, 2 fen, 6 li, 2 hao and a half. The noon market rose another half a li, to 7 mace, 2 fen, 6 li, 7 hao and a half. As a result, it was one li better than the noon market of the previous day. "Silver Clearing" was 3 mace in the early market and 3 mace and 4 fen in the noon market. As a result, it seemed to have increased by 2 fen compared to the previous day. Adding water to the clearing funds was also good, with an estimated 2 mace and 5 or 6 fen. The bank quoted 1 mace and 2 fen. Overall, the atmosphere of the silver market still had a tense feel.</p>
<p>▲ Auxiliary Coin Market Conditions: Jiangnan small foreign coins remained at 6 mace, 5 fen, 2 li in the early market, and continued to decrease by 1 li in the noon market to 6 mace, 5 fen, 1 li. Trading volume was 3,000 jiao in the early market and 1,500 jiao in the noon market. Guangdong small foreign coins were 6 mace, 5 fen, 2 li in the early market, and the same in the noon market, with no difference from the early market of the previous day. Trading volume was 155,000 jiao in the early market and 35,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins decreased by 500 wen to 378,000 wen, with a trading volume of over 32,000 strings.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds" Yesterday, the inflow and outflow of funds at the banks were slightly higher than usual. The settlement of bills and funds by Chinese merchants was more than 3.1 million, the settlement of bills and funds by foreign merchants was more than 2.9 million, the settlement of special funds was more than 2 million, the settlement of various goods, foreign exchange taxes, and miscellaneous funds was 10.23 million, the settlement of telegraphic transfers was 1.45 million, warehouse inflows were 800,000, warehouse outflows were 400,000, the settlement of silver funds by money shops and public silver was more than 49 million, the settlement of clearing funds was more than 5.1 million, the settlement of funds from various routes was more than 1.6 million, and the receipt of cash was 40-50 million. "Foreign Funds" The settlement of foreign exchange transfer bills was 1.215 million in the early market and 1.12 million in the noon market. Banknotes were 85,000 in the early market and 65,000 in the noon market. Off-exchange banknotes were 130,000 in the early market and 90,000 in the noon market. Bank transactions were 750,000 in the early market and 550,000 in the noon market. The inflow and outflow of foreign accounts between various banks was more than 1.9 million, the inflow and outflow of banknotes was 1.56 million, the settlement of foreign funds by money shops and public funds was more than 7.2 million, the settlement of foreign clearing funds was more than 1.3 million, the inflow and outflow of foreign exchange loans was more than 1.5 million, the source of customer funds was more than 200,000, outflows were more than 600,000, and transactions of small money shops were 600-700,000.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Fluctuate</h3>
<p>▲ First Rise Then Fall, Fluctuations Quite Intense ▲ Trading Volume Exceeds 15 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for various bonds on the Chinese Merchants Exchange: Although there were many types of spot trading, the trading volume was still small. Futures were very active due to the significant fluctuations in bond prices. The trend in market prices was that initially, various parties believed that although there was no significant improvement in the diplomatic situation, the domestic peace and reunification conference had now come to an end, and the prospects were optimistic. Therefore, market sentiment was good, and buying was strong, causing the prices of all bonds to rise rapidly, significantly higher than last weekend. For example, consolidated tax and troop reduction, etc., each rose by 1.67 yuan, and others also rose by more than one yuan. However, the buying interest suddenly weakened in the secondary market, and sellers sold off, which was stronger than in the morning. As a result, there was a uniform contraction. The market was still tired in the latter part of the day, and the ups and downs were relatively mild. As a result, the ups and downs were very slight compared to last weekend, except for a drop of more than one yuan in customs futures and financial spot, and a drop of nearly one yuan in troop reduction next month. The amount of rise and fall was only around two or three jiao. In addition, the spot price of the 1920 customs small ticket, excluding principal and interest, rose by 1.9 jiao compared to the end of last month. The reason why bond prices rose and then fell was that the rise was due to the temporary excitement of market sentiment, and the subsequent decline was due to the serious diplomatic situation. The Japanese showed no remorse, and the Northeast problem was not easy to solve. Although Britain and the United States intended to uphold justice, it was difficult to expect major developments for a while. This is why market sentiment turned weak again, and prices remained tired. The future trend is still as chaotic as before. The total daily spot trading volume was 22,500 yuan, futures were 11.1 million in the morning and more than 4 million in the afternoon, totaling more than 15 million yuan, of which the 1920 customs consolidated salt tax troop reduction and 1920 customs bonds each had 2 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Rumors Abound, Continued Decline</h3>
<p>The yarn market is very weak, and the decline is very strong. Due to the many national affairs, the silver market is extremely tight, and the gold market is falling sharply, which causes panic. Long positions are shaken, spot yarn transactions are stagnant, and various groups are helpless due to the sharp drop in futures yarn. Only the bottom goods of each factory are not thick.</p>
<p>▲ Human Biao (auction price) Declines Again by Two Taels. When the market opened, the foreign human biao was down due to the sharp fall in the gold market and the lack of buyers. The selling sentiment was very strong. All months fell by 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8 qian. The market atmosphere was still weak in the afternoon, and rumors were rampant.

<h3>Cotton Price Breaks into Two Taels Mark</h3>
<p>▲ Long Positions Unsupported...Selling Pressure Particularly Strong</p>
<p>The cotton market fell miserably due to the sharp fall in the gold market and the sharp rise in silver prices, which made the foreign cotton calculation silver plate particularly cheap. Various factories have purchased a large amount, which has caused discouragement. Buyers have become shaky, and all months have broken the two tael mark. However, the Han gang (group) tightened this month due to the lack of supply from various routes and had the intention of increasing the margin. However, the overall situation is very pessimistic.</p>
<p>▲ Han Biao (auction price) Falls by Eight Qian. When the Han Biao market opened, it was powerless due to foreign cotton and the sharp fall in the gold market. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and all months fell sharply. The market was still tired in the second and third rounds. All months fell by 0.75 qian.

<h3>British and Indian Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>▲ Bombay initially experienced a sharp rise in market prices due to speculative buying and short covering at the beginning of the week. The delivery amount was absorbed due to rain reports and exchange rates. The demand for anti-aircraft guns was smooth. Later, speculative sellers sold at high prices and Liverpool's hedge sales weakened again. In terms of spot goods, the initial demand was weak, but later the demand became wider due to the good benefits of Omura and Pingguoer old flowers.</p>
<p>▲ Liverpool's spot sales were good last week, and futures prices shifted with silver prices, but the trend was still strong. Later, the US cotton government report will be published soon, and it gradually became bland. The weekend trend was quite expensive, and the Egyptian cotton market was firm.</p>

<h3>Food - Tightness Seen in Rice Market Downriver</h3>
<p>▲ Nantou Yesterday, the sources of supply from various groups were scarce, and the inventory of Pujiang was also scarce. Shops in urban and rural areas became more active. Due to the busy farming season in the production area, there was not much outflow of goods. The market gradually hardened. The market price of Hou Xin Jing rice increased again. There were few Bai Ge and late-season rice, etc. Although transactions on this street were normal, they hardened by two jiao. Du Yang Jian rice was scarce, and the route was still continuous. The inventory was thin and increased by one or two jiao. There were a few Yin Hua rice shipments, and the scattered demand was still flat. Wine merchants picked and moved at high prices. The middle-grade goods were not transformed. The market shape was high and determined, but loose in the middle.</p>
<p>▲ Xin Zha Yesterday, the weather in the market was bad, and there were not many goods from various routes. There were a few transactions in this city, and the market rose. The top-grade Chang Kun Bai Jing rice hardened by four jiao. The normal fluctuations of the middle-grade goods were limited. There was very little inventory of early and late-season rice. Buyers were normal, and the price plate tightened slightly by one and a half jiao. There was a slight demand for Du Bu Jian rural rice. The inventory of foreign Jian was dry and the flow was smooth. The price increased by two jiao. Changed Yin Yuan rice was also tight.</p>
<h3>Spot Foreign Rice Rises by One Jiao</h3>
<p>▲ Foreign Firms Sell Large Amounts of Forward Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market conditions: spot goods were smoothly traded in this street, and the market saw a significant improvement. Saigon and Xiaojiao each rose by more than one jiao, and trading was also strong. The general market sold 5,000 packages of No. 1 Saigon at 11.6 yuan to 11.75 yuan, and 2,000 packages of Xiaojiao at 10.05 yuan, 10.042 yuan, and then to 10.025 yuan, all of which were received by this street. The demand in this street was very good, and there was a good outlook for the future. However, due to the strong fall in the gold price and the lengthened exchange rate, the forward rice price was cheaper, and various foreign firms tried their best to sell it. Tian Xiang, An Li, Jie Cheng, and Xiang Mao all sold very well. More than 10,000 tons were traded throughout the day, and new transactions accounted for nine-tenths. Xiaojiao opened at 5.02 taels to 5 taels in March, 5.09 taels to 5.04 taels in April, 5.15 taels in May, and down to 4.85 taels in December. No. 1 Saigon was 5.4 taels in January and 5.7 taels in April, all of which were pulled in by this street, and the price fell again.</p>
<h3>Flour Price Plunges Four or Five Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market unanimously presented a plunging phenomenon. The quoted price of foreign wheat also saw a slight decrease, and the most powerful factor was the sharp fall in the gold price. The high price of the previous month was based on the skyrocketing price of foreign wheat. The current gold price has fallen by about 100 taels compared to that time. The lengthened exchange rate is also a fact that must be reached. If this is reversed, it is no different from the fact that foreign wheat can still be priced. Moreover, the market also rumored that a certain factory had already ordered two ships, and the price was kept secret. In addition, the riots of Japanese wave people in Tianjin also brought about obstacles to future sales. Therefore, from the opening to the closing, people's hearts were unstable from beginning to end, and the prices continued to fall miserably. Observing the subsequent steps, it seems that there are more ominous signs than auspicious signs. As a result, the price for this month plummeted by 4.5 fen compared to the closing price of the previous week, December fell by 5 fen, January fell by 3.75 li, February fell by 3.5 fen, and March and April fell by 2.75 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat: Sky-High Dumping</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market saw a sharp drop. The quoted price of foreign wheat also fell slightly, and the opening price of the gold market also fell by 20 to 30 taels. The foreign exchange rate was also lengthening step by step. People's hearts were unusually weak. In general, people were afraid of the lengthening of the exchange rate and that foreign wheat would have to come again. Therefore, the major long positions and temporary sky-high positions dumped heavily. The market atmosphere was seen to be collapsing. It is estimated that the recent period fell by 0.78 fen, and the long-term period fell by 0.56 fen. However, in the middle of the day, there were rumors that the United Kingdom purchased a large amount of wheat from the Americas, or that foreign wheat had to re-enter the rising path. People's hearts were stimulated, and the recent period rose by 0.56 fen. As a result, this month fell by 5 fen compared to the previous week, December fell by 5 fen, January fell by 6 fen, February fell by 5 fen, March fell by 4 fen,</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Slump with Weak Market Sentiment</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were still few dispatches from sugar production areas in the sugar market. The exchange market of the guild hall saw even less foreign exchange. Clearance was scarce and market sentiment weakened further with no inquiries and abundant sales. Market prices plummeted accordingly. No. 24 Dutch sugar coarse granulated white was initially quoted at taels 10 and mace 7, quickly traded at taels 10 and mace 6, and later settled slightly at taels 10 and mace 5. No. 20 medium granulated white traded between taels 10 and mace 3.3 to mace 3. The market trend was generally stable. Taikoo sugar trading was active, and the price drop was no less than that of coarse granulated sugar. However, market inventory was not high, and actual inventory was scarce. B mark was at taels 11 and mace 8, DY mark at taels 11 and mace 7, CW mark at taels 11 and mace 7.5, HX mark at taels 11 and mace 6, and HM mark at taels 11 and mace 2. The market situation was still stable with no concerns of a sudden drop.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Plain Thick Woolens Sell Well at Stable Prices</h3>
<p>Yuan Chang plain thick woolens have been selling briskly recently, with both local and foreign customers needing them, mostly for making overcoats. As a result, Western clothing businesses and tailor shops have strong demand. Although retail and wholesale trade are thriving, prices remain stable, as the market is saturated and prices are not easy to rise. Yesterday, Taihe plain thick woolens were still quoted at taels 4 and mace 5, Lie Feng at taels 5 and mace 6.5, Shili Luo at taels 4 and mace 1, Gebo first grade at taels 3 and mace 8.5, second grade at taels 3 and mace 5, genuine first grade at taels 4 and mace 4, and Tianxiang at taels 3 and mace 2.5.</p>
<h3>Metal Association Sells Two Thousand Boxes of Iron</h3>
<p>The Metal Association's iron trade had been inactive for many days, leading many in the industry to feel hopeless. However, judging from the trend of the last two or three days, there have been signs of a spring revival. Yesterday, there was some activity from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and the Fujian and Zhejiang regions, and local factories also purchased vigorously. The total number of transactions yesterday was more than 2,000 boxes. The price for old steel mill iron was taels 29 per box, new steel mill iron at taels 28 and mace 5, French goods at taels 28, English goods at taels 26 and mace 5, and other miscellaneous items at taels 26.</p>
<h3>Coal: Liujiang Coal Rises by One Tael</h3>

The market price is firm and yesterday, the market quoted a price increase of one tael per ton compared to before. Xiang Liujiang chunks (i.e., No. 1) are priced at taels 16 and mace 5 per ton, and Chou Liujiang chunks (i.e., No. 3) are priced at taels 12 and mace 5 per ton.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Forcibly Seizes Northeast Salt Tax Case</h3>
<p>▲Co-Director Goffe files three reports ▲Japanese army seizes over a million twice ▲Song Ziwen to cable Shi Zhaoji today</p>
<p>Since the incident of the Japanese army forcibly seizing salt tax from the Yingkou and Changchun Salt Revenue Audit Sub-Offices in the three northeastern provinces, the Salt Revenue Audit Office has continuously received telegrams from Mr. Pearson, the director of the Yingkou Sub-Office. The most recent telegram arrived at 5:30 PM yesterday at the local General Office. It has been learned that the Japanese military authorities have forcibly seized the Northeast salt tax twice. The first time was on October 30, when they took 672,000 yuan of salt tax from the Liaoning province from the Yingkou Sub-Office. The second time was on November 6, when they took 720,000 yuan of salt tax from the Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces from the Changchun Sub-Office. The Japanese military authorities also declared that they would extract 45,000 yuan daily.</p>
<p>▲Remarks by Co-Director Goffe A reporter from this newspaper visited Dr. Goffe, Co-Director of the Salt Revenue Audit Office, yesterday. According to him, the fact that the Japanese army has seized the Northeast tax has been successively reported to Finance Minister Song Ziwen and Salt Affairs Director Zhu Tingqi. The Northeast tax collection agencies belong to the central government. Now, the Japanese military authorities are interfering with the tax collection agencies of the internationally recognized National Government by force and forcibly taking the tax, which is an act of violating international law. As for the Japanese representative Yoshizawa, in response to the Chairman of the League of Nations Council Briand regarding this matter, he strongly denied that the Japanese military and police detained the Northeast salt tax and attached a telegram from the Japanese government explaining the truth of the matter, stating that "the Shenyang Local Maintenance Committee requested the transfer of salt surplus from the Yingkou Salt Revenue Audit Sub-Office on September 22, and the audit office personnel replied to the committee, expressing their promise." Dr. Goffe clarified this, saying that after the Japanese army occupied Shenyang at midnight on September 18, they sent personnel to Yingkou and Changchun on the 19th to monitor the Salt Revenue Audit Office, accumulating the daily tax revenue without allowing it to be remitted to the National Government, and only recently took the cash. The date of the incident was actually before the establishment of the Shenyang Local Maintenance Committee.</p>
<p>▲Song Ziwen cables Shi Zhaoji Co-Director Goffe, based on a telegram from Pearson, the director of the Yingkou Sub-Office, has reported twice to Finance Minister Song. Finance Minister Song has also cabled Minister Shi Zhaoji in Geneva to inform the League of Nations Council. Another detailed telegram was originally scheduled to be sent to Geneva last night, but the Salt Affairs General Office received another telegram from the Yingkou Sub-Office at 5:30 PM yesterday. Co-Director Goffe immediately prepared another detailed report last night, requesting Finance Minister Song to, based on the facts, cable Minister Shi to submit it to the League of Nations. Therefore, the Finance Ministry's detailed telegram to Shi needs to be drafted separately and is expected to be sent to Geneva around today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲Instructions from the Salt Revenue Audit Office The Salt Revenue Audit Office believes that the Japanese army's forcible seizure of the Northeast salt tax affects the foreign debt guarantee and makes the 1929 foreign debt reorganization plan impossible to implement. Therefore, since this incident occurred, on one hand, it has requested Representative Shi to protest to the League of Nations and demand that Japan return the tax revenue. On the other hand, it has instructed the directors of the Yingkou and Changchun Sub-Offices to protest to the relevant authorities and not to negotiate with any party to avoid misunderstandings. It should be instructed to remit the tax revenue to the National Government as soon as possible. If forcibly obstructed, a protest should be filed. As for the tax revenue arrangements between the central government and Deputy Commander Zhang and other officials, it is an internal matter and cannot be used as an excuse. Chinese and foreign officials of the Salt Revenue Audit Office are not allowed to leave their posts without orders. As for the local situation, Co-Director Goffe personally notified the Japanese Minister Koki Shigemitsu yesterday. Pearson, the director of the Yingkou Sub-Office, telegraphed last night, requesting permission to come to Shanghai to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>▲Memorials from the Salt Revenue Audit Office Memorials from Goffe, Co-Director of the Salt Revenue Audit Office, to Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance: (1) (Omitted above) On September 19, the Manchurian Japanese army forcibly occupied the Niuzhuang Salt Revenue Audit Office. Twenty armed soldiers threatened the audit office officials with guns, ordering them not to move. The three guards of the audit office were disarmed, and armed Japanese soldiers were sent to guard the door. All the account books in the office were seized, and another accountant was appointed. The bank that collected taxes on behalf was also occupied. Since then, all tax revenues have been monitored and are not allowed to be remitted to the National Government. (Omitted in the middle) At 10:00 AM on October 31, the director of the Niuzhuang Audit Office telegraphed the following report: On October 30 at 8:00 AM, the Yingkou branch of the Bank of China sent a letter stating that at 11:00 AM today, Yamada, a consultant to the Dongsansheng Guanyin Bank and the Liaoning Provincial Department of Finance (newly established), along with personnel from the Japanese military headquarters and armed soldiers, came to extract the salt tax revenue. They were told that money could not be withdrawn without a check. They replied that regardless of whether the audit office director allowed it or not, the money must be withdrawn today. If there were any problems, they would be responsible. If payment was refused, it would be regarded as intentional defiance. The arguments were ineffective, and at 4:00 PM, 672,709 yuan and 5 jiao and 6 fen were taken away. After several negotiations, Yamada issued a receipt. (Omitted below) Memorial (2) On November 3, a report was submitted. The following is a continuation: (1) The Changchun Audit Sub-Office telegraphed on the 6th, stating that all deposits in the Chinese Communications Banks today were forcibly submitted to the Changchun Dongsansheng Guanyin Bank with a notice signed solely by officials of the Monopoly Transportation Bureau and approved by the local foreign (Japanese) military authorities. Our protests were ineffective. The Monopoly Transportation Bureau officially notified the sub-office today, stating that the audit office was not recognized. (2) A telegram from the Yingkou commissioner reported that three foreigners (Japanese), one of whom was in military uniform, demanded the tax revenue of October 30. Later, three Chinese from the Guanyin Bank joined in, claiming that they were determined to extract the tax revenue collected by the Bank of China (Yingkou branch) daily, averaging about 45,000 yuan. According to the Changchun Sub-Office's previous report, the Changchun salt tax account had accumulated 2.6 million yuan by October 31. It is expected that the money extracted on the 6th will be added to the tax revenue collected by Jilin and Heilongjiang after the end of October (according to last night's telegram, 720,000 yuan was taken). This money was ordered by the newly appointed director of the Monopoly Transportation Bureau of the Local Maintenance Committee, backed by the Japanese occupying army. Furthermore, according to Yingkou, the decision to extract tax revenue daily will amount to 1.125 million yuan per month. The Japanese military authorities have stated that they accept the principle of allocating salt affairs expenses of 58,200 yuan per month and foreign debt apportionment of 217,800 yuan per month first, but do not recognize the repayment of arrears apportionment of 662,800 yuan per month. Now the salt tax revenue in the three northeastern provinces is extremely short. If 45,000 yuan is extracted daily on average, it will be impossible to cope with the monthly expenses and the amount due for foreign debt. The amount due for repayment of arrears will be even less. If the amount due for repayment of debts in various places cannot be fully allocated, the 1929 plan for reorganizing the salt tax-guaranteed foreign debt will face significant obstacles in implementation next year.</p>

<h3>Northeast Petition Group Visited Hu and Wang Separately Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Hosted Various Sectors to Report on the Process ▲Going to Beijing Soon, Returning Northward</p>
<p>Feng Yong, Su Shangda, Gao Jianguo, Yan Baohang, Du Yijie, and other five representatives of the Northeast People's National Salvation Petition Group visited Hu Hanmin at Maisi Ai Road yesterday at 5:00 PM and talked for about an hour. After the representatives bid farewell, they went to visit Wang Jingwei at Xin Pushi Road and left at about 8:00 PM. At the YMCA on Sichuan Road, they hosted the press and various sectors. Su Shangda reported on the organization process of the Northeast People's National Salvation Petition Group and the petition situation in Shanghai in recent days, stating briefly that since the violent Japanese occupied various parts of the Northeast, the people of the Northeast, especially the intellectuals, have felt particularly painful in what they have seen and heard. They had no choice but to leave the Northeast and could not bear not to leave. Most of them gathered in Pingjin, where they organized the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Group and established a branch in Tianjin. In addition to propaganda, there were also special tasks. In the current situation, all Chinese people recognize that the entire China should deal with foreign aggression. Therefore, the people of the Northeast are paying close attention to this peace conference, and the news reported by the newspapers in Pingjin all said that the hope was dim, and finally there was news of a breakdown. Therefore, they resolutely organized a large-scale petition group to go south, weeping like in the Qin court to the gentlemen of the peace conference. After the news spread, in one day, 3,000 to 4,000 people automatically signed up, and the limit was set at 620 people due to economic reasons. After arriving in Shanghai, they learned that the peace conference had ended and lost its target. They had no choice but to submit petitions to the representatives staying in Shanghai separately and inquire about the end of the peace conference. In recent days, due to handling the pass through the concession for the whole group, the concession authorities did not allow it. Therefore, at 5:00 PM today (i.e., yesterday), five representatives were elected to visit Hu and Wang. The responses were very satisfactory. Therefore, the task of coming to Shanghai has been completed. They are scheduled to go to Beijing for a petition soon and then return to the north. Thank you very much for the hospitality of various groups in Shanghai. The following is a record of the conversation between Hu Hanmin and the representatives of the petition group yesterday. (As for the conversation between the representatives of the group and Wang, Wang detailed the process of the peace conference and the diplomatic policy towards the Northeast. The words were similar to Wang's conversations with various sectors in recent days, so they are not repeated here.) (The representative asked) What is the situation of national peace and unity? (Hu replied) Regarding the peace and unity organization and the unified government, the representatives of both sides have discussed and reached results. These issues now need to be submitted to the Fourth National Congress for discussion of the methods of the preparatory meeting, and then wait for the handling of the fourth executive and supervisory committees. (Asked) What is your opinion on the disposal of the diplomatic problems of the three northeastern provinces? (Answer) Now, the most important thing for this problem is to immediately send personnel to recover the lost territory. However, what I don't understand is that Japan's verbal propaganda does not say that it wants to take it for itself, but our country ignores it and does not take it back quickly. Although there is a Northeast Recovery Committee recently, it seems to be related to one person. It must be known that if our country can officially send personnel to take back the lost territory, and Japan is unwilling to hand it over, it can prove Japan's aggressive ambition, and our country can also make some preparations to fight it out and preserve the Chinese nation. If we continue to perfunctorily shirk responsibility and hold an attitude of non-resistance and non-responsibility, we will see a great land of China that will not be ours. (Asked) Our country has no preparation. Even if we want to take back the lost territory, what if Japan is strong and domineering to the end and our country is not strong enough? (Answer) If it is true as you said, then the Republic of China can simply be given to others with hands tied. What is the point of trying to survive? The representatives then asked Mr. Hu to express that they would set off for Beijing today to petition the government authorities again and urge them to recover the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Representatives Leave Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>▲But Wang and Wu Still Stay in Shanghai for a Short Stay</p>
<p>After the Beijing-Guangdong Peace and Unity Conference was declared over, the Beijing and Guangdong sides are now actively preparing for the convening of the Fourth National Congress. The three Guangdong representatives, Sun, Chen, and Li, who were sent back to Guangdong, are scheduled to leave Shanghai on the Queen of Asia at 2:00 PM today. Yesterday, the second central committee members Cheng Qian, Li Liejun, Xu Qian, and others specially visited the Guangdong representative Sun Zhesheng at the Sun residence in the French Concession and said that they would provide considerable assistance in the release of Deng Yanda. As for Li Jishen's return to Guangdong, it has not yet happened due to physical discomfort. The news from yesterday is recorded in the following sections:</p>
<p>▲Wang Jingwei's Important Letter to Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Chen Youren, etc. Returning South Wang Jingwei, Wu Chaoshu, Zou Lu, and Zeng have sent a letter to the representatives of the Fourth National Congress. This letter must be published in Guangzhou. Wang Jingwei also has another letter to his comrades who have shared hardships with him for many years. The full text is disclosed as follows: All Comrades, This is for your information. The results of this peace conference have been described in detail in the joint telegram issued yesterday. I think you have seen it. I was ordered to stay in Shanghai and did not get to return to Guangzhou to gather with you. If you have any questions about the results of the peace conference, I cannot answer them face-to-face. I respectfully propose the following questions and answers: Question 1. According to the original draft of the telegram from both parties, it is advocated that a unified government should be produced by a unified conference. If this is the case, is it not inconsistent with the original advocacy? Answer: The so-called unified conference does not stipulate how its composition should be. Now, the first plenary meeting of the Fourth Central Committee has decided to amend the Organic Law of the National Government and reorganize the government. Therefore, the so-called unified conference will be replaced by the first plenary meeting of the Fourth Central Committee. Question 2. Why is it not decided immediately whether Mr. Chiang should step down? Answer: This is the focus of the dispute between the two sides. In the past, there was no way to resolve this dispute other than by military means. Now, it is resolved by political means. It must be known that the result of military solution is often that the military force of party A is eliminated, and the military force of party B replaces it. There is no other way to use it lightly. If political methods can solve it, why take military solutions? The first plenary meeting of the Fourth Central Committee decided to amend the Organic Law of the National Government and reorganize the government, which is the so-called method of political solution. The amendment to the Organic Law of the National Government is about the issue of the system, and the reorganization of the government is about the issue of personnel selection. As far as the issue of the system is concerned, the current meeting has decided on a draft of the reform of the central political system. If it can be implemented, it can liberate politics from the control of military forces. This is actually the first step in democratic politics. As far as the issue of personnel selection is concerned, it is expected that there will be two proposals at that time: Mr. Chiang's resignation and retention. These two proposals will be decided by the majority of the meeting and obeyed. Compared with deciding the personal advancement and retreat by the victory or defeat of the military, it is much more economical. If we want to make the Chinese political phenomenon enter the right track, there is no other way to replace military solutions with political solutions. The Financial Committee can refuse the burden of civil war, and all kinds of resolutions regarding political disputes and not lightly solving them with military force are all ways to prevent civil war. If our comrades of the party can faithfully implement them, then it is hoped that the period of political tutelage will not return to military administration and will gradually advance to constitutional government. The above two are just the big ones. In short, our party comrades have sacrificed so many lives and so much freedom in the past few years. Now, we can only continue to work hard to complete this task, restoring democratic centralization to the party and supporting democratic politics in the country. It all depends on this. Resistance to foreign powers and cultivation of the country's foundation also depend on this. I only hope that you will consider it and wish you peace. Wang Zhaoming respectfully, November 9.</p>
<p>▲Fujian Representatives Visited Hu Yesterday More than ten representatives attending the Fourth National Congress of Fujian Province, including Fang Shengtao and Lin Zhiyuan, visited Mr. Hu Zhantang at Maisi Ai Road yesterday at 3:00 PM and talked for a long time. They did not leave until after 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲Wang and Wu Will Not Return to Guangdong Temporarily A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met with Mr. Zou Haibin yesterday and asked Zou whether he and Mr. Wang Zhaoming and Wu Chaoshu would return to Guangdong to attend the Fourth National Congress. According to him, for the convenience of contact, I and Mr. Wang and Wu plan to stay in Shanghai for a short stay temporarily. Therefore, it has not yet been decided whether to return to Guangdong and attend the Fourth National Congress.</p>

<p>▲Telegram from the Tianjin Banking Association The Bankers Association of this city received a telegram from the Tianjin Banking Association, stating: Shanghai Bankers Association forwarded to the representatives of the Beijing-Guangdong peace talks, Your Excellencies, the Liaoning disaster is in full swing, and the country is dying day by day. Under the overturned nest, how can there be intact eggs? We are in the same boat and should help each other like the people of Hu and Yue. We earnestly request you to donate and remove your prejudices and go to the country together, to think of the meaning of stopping the war and defending against insults, and to plan for the unity and integrity of the country. Otherwise, the hearts of the people will be gone, and the foundation of the country will follow. Who will be responsible for the sinking of China? The Shanghai Bankers Association's declaration, which it declared daily, is unanimously agreed by our association and we will abide by it together. We respectfully send this telegram to you for your perusal. Tianjin Banking Association, Yu.</p>
<p>▲Petition from the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Branch Associations More than 30 branch associations of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Citizens, each sending representatives, went directly to Wu Chaoshu's residence on Gedeng Road at 8:00 AM on the 8th to petition the peace representatives for peace. Because the preparatory meeting had ended the day before, there was no meeting, and most of the Beijing and Guangdong representatives were not there. Mr. Wang Jingwei and Wu Chaoshu first met with the representatives of the branch associations of the Municipal Federation. The representatives of the branch associations of the Municipal Federation explained their petition opinions. In addition to submitting a petition, the representatives successively spoke, expressing their sincere request for peace. The outline is roughly divided into eight points: (1) Swear to support unity and peace; (2) Unite as one to defend against insults and save the country; (3) Eradicate the bad to straighten the discipline; (4) Abolish the forced unity of public opinion; (5) Freedom of speech, publication, and association; (6) Improve municipal administration and accommodate civil rights; (7) Please advocate democracy and public opinion as the return; (8) Implement the doctrine and strictly abide by the founding of the country. The above is a brief summary of the lengthy statements. After the petitions were presented, Mr. Wang and Wu gave speeches in turn (already seen in the report on the 9th, no need to repeat). On the day of the petition, there were representatives from various trade unions and trade associations, who were all after the association. Because the lectures were in the same hall, it was inevitable that they were mixed and unclear, so the name of the association was not listed.</p>
<p>▲Letter from the Women's National Salvation League The Women's National Salvation League sent a letter to all the representatives of the peace conference, stating: To all the representatives of the peace conference, Greetings. Looking at the declarations of all of you this time, you have specific plans for diplomacy, finance, and military affairs, which are in line with the minimum requirements of the people, which shows that the trend of the times is the same as the psychology. Your awareness and determination are accepted by our league on behalf of the female compatriots, and we will support its implementation and supervise its laziness or repetition, so that the mission of peace and unity can be completed in the shortest period of time to comfort the expectations of the 400 million people. Since ancient times, everyone has died, and the people cannot stand without faith. Those who cultivate human titles must cultivate their heavenly titles. The duration of political life has always been based on the people's will. Internal peace is the way to resist foreign countries, and the survival of the party depends on the integrity of the country. In the same boat, we are willing to work hard together. Respectfully, the Women's National Salvation League.</p>
<h3>Temporary Suspension of Coal Transport Price Increase on the Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>▲To be implemented upon approval from the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Regarding the price increase for coal transport on the Jiaoji Railway, after Shandong mine owners expressed their opposition and initiated a unified strike, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, considering that the boycott of Japanese coal relies on domestic coal supply and that further issues could lead to a coal shortage with significant ramifications, telegraphed the Ministry of Railways requesting cancellation of the price increase. Simultaneously, they telegraphed the Shandong merchants to resume coal transport. It is now reported that a considerable resolution has been reached. The Jiaoji Railway Bureau has agreed to temporarily suspend the proposed coal transport price increase. The telegrams from the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Railways are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Telegram from the Ministry of Industry to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, forwarded to the Navigation Industry Association, Chinese Cotton Mill United Association, Silk Manufacturers Association, Chinese Seamen's Union, Reorganization Committee, Copper, Iron, and Machinery Association, Oil Press Association, Inland Steamer Association, Chinese Marine Engineers Union, and the Chinese Merchant Ship Masters Association: Your telegram dated the 30th has been received. This matter has been previously reported by the Shandong Zibo Zhangwei Mining and Coal Industry United Association, Shanghai Coal Industry Association, National Chamber of Commerce Federation, and China National Coal Production and Sales United Association, stating that the sudden increase in freight rates by the railway makes it difficult for coal merchants to bear the burden. They earnestly request prompt withdrawal of the order to maintain domestic coal supply and alleviate merchants' difficulties. The Ministry has informed the Ministry of Railways accordingly, stating that while domestic coal is being promoted and various ports are anticipating coal shortages, disputes regarding coal transport on the railway are undesirable. Increasing freight rates at this time seems inappropriate. Whether the Ministry of Railways can be instructed to withdraw the order or postpone the implementation date to avoid unsettling public sentiment is requested for consideration and handling. The current telegram presents the same situation and claims that the Ministry of Railways has been telegraphed separately. It is hoped that the Ministry of Railways will consolidate the cases for review and handling. Sincerely, Ministry of Industry.</p>
<p>▲Reply from the Ministry of Railways, dated the 30th: Your telegram has been received. The coal freight rate on the Jiaoji Railway was appropriately reduced during the summer period at the request of various merchants, as instructed by the Ministry. Now that the reduced price period has expired, a fair special price has been re-established. This was pre-scheduled and implemented on time and is not a separate case. All railways are handling this simultaneously, not just the Jiaoji Railway alone. As for the excessive cost of Shandong coal, there are other reasons, certainly not due to the Jiaoji Railway freight rates. The Ministry has already explained this meticulously in a previous telegram to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Regarding the current telegram and the request from various organizations to temporarily retain the price increase proposal, this is in line with the Ministry's current approach of temporarily setting coal transport price increases for various railways. Once approved by the Executive Yuan, it will be implemented immediately. Whether Shandong coal can fully supply Shanghai's coal shortage and whether the pricing can maintain the current state after the temporary suspension of the price increase, preventing both the railway bureau and users from suffering while coal merchants and transporters alone profit, depends entirely on the strict supervision and correction from all sectors. Otherwise, the facts will be evident, and it is impossible for a few individuals to deceive the world. This is hereby approved and notified.</p>
<h3>Current Status of Resumption of Operations of Domestic Vessels on Rivers and Seas</h3>
<p>▲Yangtze River, North and South Seas routes</p>
<p>▲Approximately 60 domestic vessels currently in operation</p>
<p>▲18 Japanese vessels remain on rivers and seas</p>
<p>Since the boycott, Japanese ships on rivers and seas have completely ceased operations. Even if they are running, they have no business. Cargo on various routes is abundant, but ships are scarce, allowing British ships to take the opportunity to rise. In September and October, Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire each profited between one and two million. Since last month, when domestic shipping companies such as China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and San Peh Steam Navigation Company submitted a request to headquarters to allow ships to resume operations, they have been gradually returning to Shanghai and successively starting schedules. Today, domestic vessels on various river and sea routes can fully operate. The recent situation of shipping is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>▲Full operation of ships on the upper and lower Yangtze River. Chinese vessels on the Yangtze River, returned to China Merchants and San Peh in late October, are successively resuming operations. Currently, only the Jiangyu, Yongxing, and Jiangtian vessels are still being rented by the Transportation Department on the Shanghai-Hankou line. The rest have been returned to their respective shipping bureaus. Therefore, Yangtze River schedules now include the Jiang'an, Jiangshun, Xinjiang, Jianghua, Jiangjing, Jiangda, Jianguo, Xinning, Changxing, Dexing, Fulong, Chang'an, and Ningshao vessels. In the upper reaches, as the Kuaili, Emei, and Fuyang vessels have been returned, the Yichang, Changsha, and Chongqing schedules are all operating. More than ten vessels are in operation, including the Guangji, Liji, Hongyuan, Hongheng, Hongli, Hongzhen, and Wuxing. China Merchants is further expanding its upper Yangtze shipping business and has added two new large tugs and barges to the Hunan route. Currently, there are 26 Chinese river vessels operating on the upper and lower Yangtze River.</p>
<p>▲Smooth operations on North and South Sea routes. On the Guangzhou route of the South Sea line, since China Merchants dispatched the Yuan'an vessel, it is currently the peak season for loading goods such as beans, kernels, and cloth. It is regrettable that there are no additional vessels available. Additional schedules will be added once the ocean vessels rented by headquarters are returned. However, Zhengji Company has transferred four vessels in the North Sea to directly operate from Niuzhuang to various ports in the South Sea. In North China, China Merchants has two vessels operating between Yantai and Tianjin, and two vessels operating between Dalian and Yingkou. Zhaoxing and Zhengji each have three or four vessels traveling between Yantai, Yingkou, Tianjin, and Shanghai. To transport domestic coal, China Merchants and others will dispatch several ocean vessels to Qindao to transport coal. Zeng Guangqing, Chief of the Business Department of China Merchants, is taking this opportunity to go to Hong Kong to personally purchase two vessels to operate shipping. The first vessel has arrived, and the second will arrive in Shanghai soon, dispatching them to the North and South Seas to load cargo.</p>
<p>▲New domestic vessels added on the Shanghai-Fuzhou route. China Merchants, San Peh, and Chang'an each have one vessel operating on the Shanghai-Fuzhou route. Osaka Shosen Kaisha has three vessels traveling back and forth. Since the current boycott of goods began, merchants in Fujian have also unanimously refused to load Japanese ships. Starting this month, dockworkers and barge workers in Fuzhou have agreed not to load or unload goods from Japanese ships. Therefore, although Japanese ships are sailing, they have no business. Recently, when Fujian goods were congested, China Merchants' Guangli suddenly suspended operations for repairs. Customers urgently requested ships and sent telegrams to Shanghai. The Zhejiang Shipping Bureau of this city seized this opportunity to add a Shanghai-Fuzhou schedule, dispatching the Deli vessel from yesterday to Fuzhou to meet the demands of Fujian merchants.</p>
<p>▲Cargo congestion and increased fees on various routes. Starting this month, since domestic vessels have started operating on the Yangtze River, the export cargo of Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson is no longer as congested as last month. However, the daily freight rate per vessel for transshipment cargo is still over 10,000. The China Merchants Jianglun has recently experienced unprecedentedly good business in the upper reaches, with freight exceeding 10,000 taels per vessel. Passenger traffic is even greater, with almost every vessel filled. Freight rates for upstream cargo have increased by 15%, with sugar, grain, oil, and cloth being the major cargo. The supply of downstream cargo is severely lacking. In the North Sea routes, flour, paper, and cloth are the major cargo, and freight rates have also increased due to cargo congestion. Beans and kernels are the major cargo in the South Sea routes. Currently, there are more than 30 Chinese ocean vessels operating in the North and South Seas. Combined with the Chinese merchant ships on both the rivers and seas, there are approximately 60 vessels currently in operation, an increase of approximately 40 vessels compared to last month. As for the Japanese vessels that have not suspended operations, there are currently 4 vessels on the Yangtze River, 4 vessels of Nisshin Kisen Kaisha in the North and South Seas, 3 vessels of Osaka Shosen Kaisha, 5 vessels of Dalian Kisen Kaisha, and 2 vessels of Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, totaling 18 vessels, but there is nothing to speak of in terms of business.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's News from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association</h3>
<p>▲Warning to Zhenfeng and Huatong Against Selling Japanese Goods. The Anti-Japanese Association of Shanghai sent a letter to Zhenfeng Trading Company and Huatong Electric Factory yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, previously, we received confidential reports that Zhenfeng Trading Company on the Bund and Huatong Electric Factory in Yangshupu were exclusively selling Japanese goods. We requested an investigation. After investigation, it was reported that Zhenfeng Trading Company, located upstairs of the Japanese Masui Yoko on the Bund, is indeed exclusively selling Japanese goods and is registered under a Japanese name with the consulate. Huatong Electric Factory in Yangshupu disguises and sells the goods, which is also a fact, and is related to Zhenfeng. Therefore, since the outbreak of the Japanese disaster, which has been ongoing for 50 days, the boycott of enemy goods and non-cooperation with the Japanese is a major plan for our entire nation to save itself. However, your companies, on one hand, rely on the enemy for protection, and on the other hand, deceive the domestic market, colluding with each other. You disregard the country's demise and the extinction of the race as insignificant. Your conscience is gone. Based on the above, we hereby issue a serious warning. If you fail to repent immediately and sever your relationship with the Japanese, this Association will fulfill its duties, and our compatriots will exercise their public opinion. Do not regret it later." Addressed to Zhenfeng Trading Company and Huatong Electric Factory.</p>
<p>▲Telegram to Hankou Urging Thorough Boycott of Japanese Coal. The Anti-Japanese Association telegraphed the Hankou Anti-Japanese Association, stating: "To the Hankou Anti-Japanese Association, the Coal Industry Association reported that since the anti-Japanese movement, Shanghai's industry has absolutely boycotted Japanese coal. We hear that Hankou has a method of allowing passage for a fee per ton, which may set a bad precedent for Shanghai's industry. Please telegraph the Hankou Anti-Japanese Association to jointly and thoroughly boycott it, and do not collect fees for passage to show consistency. It is important to be thorough in boycotting Japanese goods and actively carry it out. There should be no flexibility. Based on the above report, we hereby telegraph you, hoping you will take note. Sincerely, the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association."</p>
<h3>Inspection of Japanese Goods by the Clothing Industry Association</h3>
<p>▲Work Began Yesterday</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Japanese Goods Inspection Group of the Shanghai Clothing Industry Association, the standing committee members Wu Zhihao, Lu Qisheng, Hao Haishan, Yin Jiefu, Xi Xiaoyun, and others convened inspectors from various districts to decide on the plan. The plan divides the city into six districts: South Shanghai, North Shanghai, the Public Concession, the French Concession, West Shanghai, Xinzha, Caojiadu, East Shanghai Hongkou, and Yangshupu, totaling six districts. Thirty-six inspectors were designated to work together with workers in their respective areas. The South Shanghai district set off at 2:00 PM yesterday, with Xi Xiaoyun, Yao Guifang, Wu Jinxian, and other workers conducting inspections in the city, the Sixteenth Ward, Limma Road, and the Third Street. They inspected the few Japanese goods in various stores and sealed them up. They also inspected the Tonghe New Clothing Store on Wangjia Wharf, where the owner Gao Jingchuan was found cutting and sewing clothes with Japanese raw materials. The committee members seized the goods and sealed them up temporarily, intending to report it to the Anti-Japanese Association for punishment.</p>

<h3>A Major Tragedy in a Fire: Eleven People Burned to Death</h3>
<p>▲Fire Breaks Out at Pengfuji Optical Shop</p>
<p>▲Spreads to as many as 29 Houses</p>
<p>▲The Faces of the Dead are Unrecognizably Blurred</p>
<p>▲The Number of Victims May Be More Than This</p>
<p>At 1:10 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out at the Pengfuji Optical Shop, located at No. 26 Fuxing Lane, Zhangjia Lane, Sanpailou, Nanshi. The fire lasted for one hour and thirty minutes, and was finally extinguished at 2:45 AM. The fire destroyed eight neighboring houses and burned ten people to death. One person was injured and died without medical treatment. Several people were seriously injured. It was a major tragedy in a fire. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲A Family of Twenty-Eight. Peng Fuquan, a 42-year-old man from Danyang, has been running Pengfuji Optical Shop at No. 26 Fuxing Lane, Zhangjia Lane, Sanpailou, Nanshi, for many years. The business is quite prosperous. Including children, partners, and apprentices, there are a total of 28 people in the family. Peng's wife, Bian, is 38 years old and has two sons and two daughters. The eldest daughter, Suodi, is 13 years old, the second son, Suohong, is 11 years old, the third daughter, Suoying, is 4 years old, and the youngest son, Suoxi, is only 2 years old.</p>
<p>▲List of Partners' Names. Because the business is prosperous, Peng employs a total of more than 20 workers, partners, and apprentices, including Zhu Quanfu, 17 years old, Xu Yulin, 32 years old, Wang Chunlong, 34 years old, Sui Sheshun, 21 years old, Hu Tongqing, 23 years old, Yin Fashun, 20 years old, Yin Koulong, 26 years old, Jiang Linlin, 18 years old, Liu Lachun, 29 years old, Xiao Tiefang, 27 years old, Xie Fulong, 27 years old (all from Danyang), A Si, 26 years old, Wu Helin, 28 years old, Peng Yongsheng, 27 years old, Jiang Heshun, 30 years old, Wang Guilin, 20 years old, Liu Panquan, 23 years old, Tao Achun, 18 years old, Ni Siming, 22 years old, Lv Ageng, 33 years old (all from Wuxi), Zhuang Chunsheng, 25 years old, and Lu Ada, 23 years old (both from Suzhou).</p>
<p>▲Fire Suddenly Breaks Out in the Middle of the Night. Because the house is narrow and there are many people, in addition to the original houses being insufficient, two lofts were added on the upper floor to serve as dormitories for workers and apprentices. At 1:10 AM yesterday morning, when the whole family was fast asleep, the remaining fire was accidentally left in the rosin raw material used for making glasses, causing a fire. When the people woke up and realized it, they were already enveloped in thick smoke and fainted in the fire. In addition, it was late at night, and no one knew about it. It was not until the fire broke through the roof that people learned about it. However, the situation had already spread and could not be saved.</p>
<p>▲Mistress Jumps Out of Window and is Injured. At that time, Peng and his wife, Bian, jumped out of the window and were seriously injured. The fire brigades in the Nanshi districts drove to the scene one after another to assist in the rescue. A firefighter bravely rushed into the fire and rescued a partner, Peng Yongsheng. Peng was burned all over his body and was sent to Shanghai Nanyang Hospital by ambulance. Due to severe injuries, he died in the hospital at 8:00 AM yesterday. The hospital notified the second branch of the first district, which instructed the bailiff Huang Baoyuan to report to the local court for inspection.</p>
<p>▲Involved Twenty-Nine Families. The fire destroyed a total of eight houses. In addition to No. 26, where the fire started, there were the houses of Hua Aju, a Wuxi man selling chicken and duck blood at No. 24, Zhou Changyu, a Wuxi man at No. 25, Chen Dalang, a Chongming man at No. 27, Wang Zhao, a Shaoxing woman at No. 28, Guan Chunsheng, a Hangzhou man at No. 32, Ge Jintang, a Nanjing man at No. 33, and Xu Xianglin, a Haimen man at No. 34. Including the three tenants, there were a total of 29 families.</p>
<p>▲Ten Corpses. The scene was tragic. When the fire was raging, Yi, the head of the second branch of the first district, supervised all the police officers and the fire brigade to try to rescue them. After searching, Peng Fuquan, the owner of the first fire, was missing. After the fire was completely extinguished, it was already dawn. The firefighters cleaned up the remaining embers, and unexpectedly, ten bodies were successively pulled out from the fire at No. 26, all burned into charred bones, and placed on the side of the road. The faces were blurred and unrecognizable. The scene was so tragic that it made people feel sad. As for who was killed and who was spared, because the owner Peng Fuquan is still unknown, it is impossible to investigate clearly for a while. As for whether there were any victims in the other neighboring houses, the ashes are still being dug up.</p>
<p>▲Labor Unions Raise Funds to Collect Corpses. After the bodies were pulled out, Yi, the head of the second branch of the first district, immediately instructed the bailiff Huang Baoyuan to petition the local court for inspection. At 5:00 PM yesterday, Prosecutor Wu Shixin and Clerk Qian, as well as Inspector Shen, arrived at the scene and inspected a total of eleven bodies, all of which were burned to death. The names could not be identified for a while. The district heads were ordered to guard them temporarily. It is heard that a certain labor union will raise funds to collect them.</p>
<h3>Various Labor Unions Pay Attention to the You Bolu Case</h3>

<p>▲Appoint Representatives to Attend and Observe</p>
<p>The local court has scheduled a hearing for the case of You Bolu's massacre of the masses during his tenure as the chief of the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau at 10:00 AM today. The various labor unions in this city have entrusted the barrister Mao Yun to appear in court to defend him according to the law. They have also appointed more than 20 representatives to attend and observe the court at that time, so that the principal offender in the case can be punished as he deserves according to the law, so as to show the law and discipline and calm the people's anger.</p>
<h3>Seven Kidnappers in the Zhu Yanqing Case Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>▲Tang Afu Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>▲Cao Zhang Sentenced to Twelve Years</p>
<p>Zhu Yanqing, the young owner of the Zhenhe Tea Shop in De'an Lane, North Shanxi Road, Anhui Province, was kidnapped by kidnappers at about 11:00 PM on September 8 when he was taking a chartered car home. He was taken to a pavilion room at No. 73 Jianye Lane, Fulili Road, French Concession, in an attempt to extort a huge ransom. After investigation by detective Jin Jiulin and patrol detectives of the French Police, they rescued Zhu on the 15th of the month and arrested 12 men and women, including Zheng A'er, Yu Aqing, Tang Afu, Qian Daoyuan, Hong Aji, Lu Yisheng, Wang Ziqing, Liu Shaoqing, robber Cao Zhang, Zhao Liu, and Wang Jiang. They seized firearms, bullets, glasses, iron chains, and other items, and took them to the police station and escorted them to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Local Court. After repeated interrogations by Judge Luo Renji and Prosecutor Ding Shikui, the defendants confessed to kidnapping and attempting to extort ransom. The court appointed lawyers Wang Shizong, Xu Yannian, Lin Yingqing, Gu Changyuan, Wu Youyuan, and others to defend the defendants. The court announced the conclusion of the trial and waited for the verdict. Yesterday was the date of the verdict. At 10:00 AM, the police escorted the defendants to the court. Judge Luo ordered the defendants to be brought to the First Criminal Court and announced the verdict. The main text of the verdict was: Zheng A'er, Qian Daoyuan, Lu Yisheng, Liu Shaoqing, Yu Aqing, and Hong A'gen were each sentenced to death for the crime of extortion. Tang Afu was sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of kidnapping and extortion. Cao Zhang was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment for the crime of kidnapping and extortion. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined to be one day of imprisonment for every two days. Two pistols, 14 bullets, two bullet casings, one iron chain, one lock, one iron chisel, and one pair of black glasses were confiscated. Zhao Liu and Wang Jiang were acquitted.</p>
<h3>Iron Shop Owner's Young Son Kidnapped</h3>
<p>▲ Shop Owner's Cousin and a Shop Employee Conspire ▲ After the Case is Solved, a Letter Demands 50,000 Yuan Ransom</p>
<p>▲ Twelve Male and Female Bandits Arrested in Succession</p>
<p>Jiang Zirong, a Wuxi native residing at 529 Tiantong Road, runs the Yicheng Iron Shop. His life was reasonably good, and he had accumulated some savings. Jiang's seven-year-old son, Jiabao, was intelligent and handsome, and he was cherished like a pearl in the palm of the hand. Suddenly, at 2:30 PM on the 7th of this month, he went missing without a trace. A thorough search yielded no results. Later, the shop apprentice, Zhu Asan, claimed that he had seen the shop employee Shen Quanbao's cousin, Shen Asan, also from Wuxi, leave with Jiabao, but he did not know where they were going to play. Shen Quanbao knew that his cousin Asan lived at 1 Sanyangli, Yangshupu Road, and secretly reported this to the Huishan Police Station. Chinese detectives Zhao Ruisheng and Ji Peijin, along with a Western detective, went to arrest Shen Asan around 1:00 AM the day before yesterday. They asked where the child was hidden, and he claimed it was at 263 Pingliang Road. Arriving there, they found three Ningbo natives, Yang Wenguang, Zhang Mingzhao, and Wei Senlin, living in the house. A search found no sign of Jiang's child. After questioning, they learned that the child was inside the house at 150 Lumingli, Huishan Road. They arrested Yang and the other two men and went to look for the child. A Ningbo native named Yu Arui said that he had seen a woman take the child away, at number 15 in the same alley. The detectives arrested him as well. They went to the house, broke down the door, and went upstairs, where they found Shaoxing women Qian Qius, Yang Wu (Yang Wenguang's wife), Qian Wang, and Jiang's child sleeping in the same bed. The women were awakened from their dreams and arrested one by one, and Jiang Jiabao was rescued. All were taken back to the police station. Afterward, detectives were stationed inside the houses at 15 and 150 Demingli, Huishan Road. They subsequently arrested four more people, including Ningbo natives Yu Zhulin, Wang Yuanlin, Qian Zhangyue (Qian Qiu's husband), and Shaoxing woman Zhu Jinfeng. Inside the house at number 15, under the bed, they found a live ammunition pistol and one hundred bullets in a lead teapot. In total, twelve male and female bandits were apprehended. The police chief ordered them to be detained separately. The child was taken back by his father, Jiang Zirong. Around 10:00 AM, the shop received a letter delivered by the post office addressed to the child's father, stating that 50,000 yuan was required for his return. The meeting place was to be near the Xiawang Bridge outside the Ningbo South Gate, with a 1,000 yuan deposit to be paid first, or the child would be killed. (This letter was sent before the case was solved.) Jiang Zirong immediately sent it to the police station for safekeeping. Yesterday morning, Shen Asan and the other twelve were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the case, saying that the police station was prosecuting the defendants for the crime of kidnapping. A letter was also found on the defendant Yu Zhulin, detailing that the meeting place had been changed to the Liangting Pavilion at the Yongduan Lin Bridge. The person coming to meet was to wear a red scarf around their waist, a red knot on their head, and a melon-shaped hat. According to what he said at the police station, this letter was a draft written by the defendant Qian Zhangyue at the China Hotel, number 91 Jiujiang Road. The two letters, as well as the gun, bullets, lead teapot, etc., were submitted for review, with a request for a postponement. Following this, the plaintiff Jiang Zirong submitted a petition describing the events. The shop employee Shen Quanbao and apprentice Zhu Asan also gave statements. The child, Jiang Jiabao, said that he had been tricked into going outside by the defendant Shen Asan to buy a machine bicycle, and they rode in a rickshaw to a house. He pointed out that the defendants Qian Qius, Yang Wu, Qian Wang, and the woman Zhu Jinfeng were all present. Yu Zhulin had also come. Yang Wu gave him cakes to eat, and he slept with Qian Qius and Yang Wu at night. Qian Wang and Zhu Jinfeng played with him during the day. After Judge Xiao Xieying questioned the defendants, their answers were mostly evasive. However, Shen Asan admitted that he had conspired with Yu Zhulin, Qian Zhangyue, and Qian Qius. Qian Zhangyue had provided 55 yuan for the gun, which Yu Zhulin bought from a certain bungalow on Pingliang Road. Judge Xiao then ordered the defendants to be returned to custody separately for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Xue Guisheng Kidnapped and Interrogated</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 3rd of this month, rumors spread that Guisheng, the third son of the deceased paint magnate Xue Baorun, had been kidnapped that afternoon at 3:00 PM, after his car drove near Julaida Road from his private residence on Masinan Road. When reporters heard this, they went to both the English and French police stations to investigate, but both police stations claimed that no kidnapping cases had occurred within their jurisdictions that day. The reporters then went to the Xue residence to inquire, but everyone there firmly denied it and said that nothing of the sort had happened. Out of caution at the time, it was not appropriate to disclose this rashly. However, as of yesterday, according to relatives and friends close to the Xue family, the young master was indeed kidnapped on the 3rd, but the family did not report it to the police and instructed everyone in the house to keep it strictly secret from outsiders, and to reject visits from news reporters. Based on this, it seems that Xue's kidnapping is a fact.</p>
<h3>Planning Northwest Aviation</h3>
<p>▲ Li Jingcong Went to Beiping Yesterday to Plan the Route</p>
<p>The Northwest air route, planned and developed by the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, is showing some progress. The company previously sent German engineer Smith, deputy director of the air navigation team, to Beiping to plan. Now, it has sent director Li Jingcong to Beiping yesterday morning to oversee the preparations. According to Sun Mutang, secretary of the company, speaking to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, there are currently no problems with the supply of gasoline. Although the Northwest is located in a remote area with nowhere to purchase gasoline, it can be supplied from British India on one hand, and can also be purchased from Russia on the other. However, because the Northwest's weather is severely cold, the gasoline stationed at each station may freeze and become unusable. Therefore, the company plans to keep the gasoline warm at each predetermined station to prevent it from freezing and hindering flights.</p>

<h3>Japanese Goods Smuggled in Disguise</h3>
<p>After the boycott, the Japanese transported seafood from Shanghai to Dalian and Yantai, repackaged it, and then passed it off as Chinese fish. It has been confirmed that a considerable amount has already been transported. It has recently been discovered that unscrupulous merchants are packaging it for them. It is also heard that a batch of Japanese yarn in this port was transported by Japanese ships to a warehouse in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, where the brand name and appearance were changed. Then it was transported by the Pinghan train to Hankou and then on to Sichuan. The first batch of this smuggled Japanese yarn has already been shipped from Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Japanese Goods at Yuanda and Other Hardware Stores Triggers a Disturbance</h3>
<p>▲ Zhu Lide Assaults Inspector ▲ Falsely Reports to the Police Claiming Robbery</p>
<p>Recently, Yuanda, Yuyu, Xinyuyu and other hardware stores on Zhejiang Road in this port have been selling large quantities of Japanese goods. The Anti-Japanese Association, upon receiving a report, together with the inspection team of the hardware industry association, went to inspect on the 3rd. However, Zhu Lide, the son-in-law of the store owner (a postal worker at the post office), dared to punch an inspector. On the 7th, when the inspectors continued their inspection, he falsely reported to the police, resulting in the arrest of six inspectors. Upon receiving this report, the Anti-Japanese Association was extremely indignant. Yesterday, the standing committee resolved to confiscate the goods, continue to investigate and confiscate any un-confiscated goods, and then decide on how to deal with the matter. The details of the case are recorded below: (Report from the Inspection Department) Regarding the report, the department instructed Captain Yang Haichang of the special inspection team on the 3rd to go with the hardware industry association to inspect the Japanese goods at Yuyu, Yuanda, Xinyuyu and other hardware stores on Xiamen Road and Zhejiang Road. According to the officer's report, after receiving instructions to investigate and confiscate Japanese goods from Yuyu Hardware, Ge Yunting was instructed on the 3rd to go with inspectors from the hardware industry association to the old store on Xiamen Road to search the residential wing, where a large amount of Japanese goods was found. The next day, the new store on Zhejiang Road was also found to have Japanese goods. While loading the goods onto trucks, Zhu Lide, the son-in-law of the store owner, forcibly obstructed them and even dared to punch the inspector from the hardware industry association. The standing committee mediated the next day, and he apologized in the newspaper. The goods that had not been loaded were taken by the officer again on the morning of the 5th. Zhang, a store employee, said that the store had sent a letter to the hardware industry association for registration, but the association did not allow it because they were not members, resulting in a deadlock. The officer was invited to the association to negotiate for a one-day extension. The officer was not in a position to decide, so he invited Zhang to the department for instructions. Chief Hu allowed the request and set a one-day deadline. Unexpectedly, no letter from the hardware industry association had been received by noon today, and no one from the store came to negotiate. At 1:30, the officer led team members Song Peiji, Xiao Dingrong, Lou Qinghe, Li Changhui, and Lu Jinsheng of the detective department to load the goods. Unexpectedly, Zhu Lide, the son-in-law of the store owner, secretly falsely reported to the police, claiming that a large number of robbers were looting goods worth more than 10,000 yuan from the store. Suddenly, a large team of detectives rushed over, arrested the officer and five other people from the detective department without asking questions, and took them to the police station. Later, the association sent someone to bail them out, which took three hours before they were released. It is thought that Yuyu's Japanese goods were not registered in advance, nor were any procedures gone through with the hardware industry association. They were displayed and sold in the front, and hidden in the residence in secret. Such reckless behavior has already been abandoned by the Chinese people. Moreover, they dared to report to the police and frame them in order to vent their anger. Although they were willing to sacrifice for the love of the country, the association's prestige and the future of the inspection should be taken into account, and what should be done to properly handle the aftermath. If various industries follow suit, the anti-Japanese work will be unimaginable. They are specifically reporting in detail, and they are asking for a decision to be made to deal with the matter properly. They also report that the police have warned them that in the future, they must report to the police and obtain permission before loading goods in the concession, otherwise, once the store reports, they will be punished for violating the law and will not be spared again. Based on this, it is clear that Yuanda Hardware's Japanese goods were neither registered with the association nor were any procedures gone through with the association. It is obvious that they are seeking profit by selling privately. The inspectors are acting correctly in loading the goods. However, the store owner dared to instigate Zhu Lide to fabricate a false report to the police and have the inspectors arrested. If such crazy people are not severely punished, the inspectors' work will have no protection, and the association's prestige will be completely swept away. The previous report is specifically presented to the council, and they ask for prompt review, strict punishment, so as to warn the evil and prevent imitation, which is in the public interest. Respectfully presented to the standing committee, Chen Peide, director of the inspection department, and Zheng Chengqing, deputy director.</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Asks the Anti-Japanese Association Not to Arbitrarily Detain Employees</h3>
<p>▲ Promote Anti-Japanese Work ▲ Maintain the Livelihood of Employees</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, stating: With regards, on the 7th of this month, according to a joint letter from the guilds of the cotton industry, paper industry, electrical appliance industry, sugar industry, seafood and sundries industry, yarn industry, seafood business, silk and satin industry, mercerized cotton weaving industry, north-south goods exchange industry, south goods industry, knitting industry, refining industry, department store industry, and new drug industry, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has often detained low-level employees of various factories and shops during inspections of Japanese goods, and after detaining them, they do not quickly dispose of them, sometimes exceeding ten days without being released. It is not known that low-level employees only follow the instructions of the persons in charge of each factory and shop, and are never allowed to participate in important matters. Therefore, even if each factory and shop does have circumstances of selling Japanese goods, it has nothing to do with these low-level employees. Once they are arbitrarily detained, how can they be treated fairly, resulting in all current employees being in constant fear, which greatly affects commerce. Although it is said that the matter concerns national salvation and cannot be restricted by normal rules, it should also be planned and considered comprehensively to avoid punishing the innocent. Our chamber and other organizations have a duty to do so, and cannot remain silent. In order to protect the reputation of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, it is necessary to make some suggestions. We jointly request your association to check the following principles: (1) Detaining traitors must be done in conjunction with the inspection team of each industry association. Detention should not be used unless there are serious circumstances, solid evidence, and no other means of restraint other than detention. (2) Detention should be limited to the principals of each factory and shop. (3) After detention, the standing committee should be convened within 24 hours to decide on punishment or release. (4) If there are any cases of wrongful detention, the responsible personnel should be severely punished. Please forward this letter to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association for implementation, so as to correct the situation and emphasize human rights. We also hope to hear back from you. In view of this, the handling of Japanese goods by factories and shops has no direct relationship with the low-level employees themselves. If employees are detained because of improper measures taken by the store, it is unreasonable and innocent. It is also easy to cause concern among other employees. The four proposals made by the association and other organizations are aimed at promoting anti-Japanese work and maintaining the lives of employees. Accordingly, we are sending this letter to your association for review and handling, and we hope to hear back from you.</p>

<h3>The Great Alliance Committee for Promoting National Products</h3>
<p>▲ Representatives' Conference Today ▲ Declaration Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>The Great Alliance Committee for Promoting National Products, in accordance with the resolution of the fourth meeting, in order to resolve disputes in national product factories, ensure the sales of national products, and prepare for national product tea parties, etc., specifically scheduled a National Product Four Groups Factory Member Representatives' Conference at 2:00 PM today (the 10th) on the second floor of the China National Product Maintenance Association at Nine Acres to discuss the implementation methods and to discuss and issue the following declaration: Our association is the general group of the China National Product Maintenance Association, the Shanghai National Product Factories Association, the Shanghai Machine-made National Product Factories Association, and the Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products. Its main purpose is to concentrate strength, unite spirits, promote national products, study raw materials, revitalize industry, and develop the economy. Therefore, the position of our association is to work hard with comrades for national products, jointly seek the progress of the enterprise, increase the strength of national product factories, and bear the important mission of promoting national production and saving the country. At this time, when violent Japan is rampant, swallowing the Northeast, and internal and external troubles are coming together, the responsibility of our association is even greater, and the work of our association is even more arduous. We state the main points to the people of the country: (1) Our association recognizes that the shortcut to anti-Japanese resistance is economic severance, and that thoroughly boycotting Japanese goods is the fundamental method of economic severance. Therefore, within the proper bounds, our association is willing to exert all its strength and swear to deal with the anti-Japanese work. (2) If you want to achieve the effect of boycotting Japanese goods, you must support the development of production agencies. This time, the Northeast tragedy has aroused the anger of the whole country, and the only ambition is not to use Japanese goods. However, before the tragedy occurred, each factory had to compromise in order to demand raw materials. Three steps should be distinguished: A. Japanese raw materials imported before the establishment of the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association will of course not be subject to any punishment. B. Those who implemented the collection of industrial and commercial funds after the establishment of the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association can be divided into four categories: (1) those who have registered before the collection of funds, (2) those who have not registered before the collection of funds, (3) those who have collected funds but have not paid, and (4) those who have collected funds and have already paid. C. Those who were established after the establishment of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association should be given a fair criticism based on the circumstances. All those who are not traitors and have justifiable reasons should be exempted from punishment in order to maintain the only factories and support their development, so as to seek self-sufficiency in raw materials. If they are not investigated and punished in the name of traitors, it will not only fail to achieve the effect of anti-Japanese and national salvation, but will also hinder the development of national products. Unsound factories are certainly attacked and closed. That is, the six national product factories that were standardized by the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce have been identified as Japanese goods because they used some old Japanese raw materials, and five of them have been removed. Then, those that are needed daily are not available in national products, and they are turned to European and American imported products. Isn't it heartbreaking? The effectiveness of punishing and creating violent Japan has not yet been greatly achieved, but the pain of factories is inevitable. According to the original intention of anti-Japanese national salvation, they have deviated from each other. Therefore, our association today only has to make a fundamental relief, seek self-sufficiency in raw materials, grit our teeth, and work hard to produce, doing one point to receive one point of effect, and doing one inch to receive one inch of work, in order to go to the path of industrial and national salvation. All those who take illegal actions that undermine or harm the progress of the national product business, the members of our association will take orderly steps and vow to seek a common confrontation. Increasing the strength of the national product industry is to protect the vitality of the country. If all the comrades in the national product industry of our country are fully mobilized, there will be small achievements in May and great achievements in five years. How can it not be easy to avenge and avenge? (3) Our association has the sacred duty to develop production and promote national products, and is determined to serve with great effort and have a widespread impact. We should use our full strength to promote extensively, arouse public attention, enable producers to have the ability to supply as much as possible, and consumers to have the determination to use national products as much as possible, and cooperate with each other to achieve the purpose of anti-Japanese national salvation. (4) The development of national products is first in talent and economy. Therefore, the current work lies in concentrating the talent and economy of the whole country to establish a foundation for planting production and increase the strength of the national product industry. Our association will proceed in accordance with these four principles, with full strength and consistent action. Everyone working hard on the economic battlefield is the key to defeating violent Japan. Enthusiastic comrades are willing to encourage each other.</p>
<h3>Japan's Foreign Trade in October</h3>
<p>▲ Surplus of 8 Million Yuan Against China</p>
<p>The Japanese Commercial Counselor's Office announced that Japan's total export value in October was 97 million Japanese yen, with a surplus of 20 million yen. However, the trade statistics for the first ten months of this year still show a deficit of 55 million yen, but this is a decrease of 9 million yen compared to the same period last year. In addition, the export value to China in October was 22 million yen, resulting in a surplus of 8 million yen (from China's perspective, it is a deficit). The trade results with China for the first ten months of this year show a total surplus of 36 million yen, but this is a decrease of 34 million yen compared to the same period last year. Furthermore, according to the export value of Japan to China in September, which was 26 million yen, there was also a surplus of 13 million yen.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Responds to Municipal Government Regarding Extending Workers' Working Hour Standards</h3>
<p>▲Four Restrictions on Extension to Ten Hours</p>
<p>▲Does Not Apply If Labor and Management Agree</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the Factory Law, the issue of factory workers' working hours has been most prone to disputes. In fact, due to various reasons, employers also feel the difficulty of implementing the law. It is heard that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau previously drafted fifteen items for reviewing the standards of factory workers' working hours and submitted them to the Municipal Government for transfer to the Ministry of Industry for review and handling. Now, the Ministry of Industry has announced the original text of its response to the Municipal Government as follows: For the matter of response, it is approved that the Honorable Municipal Government inquired, according to the report of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, for the matter of requesting instructions. Since the implementation of the Factory Law, regarding the regulation of eight hours of work per day for adult workers, both labor and management have their own reasons, and have requested extensions or reductions. Although there are restrictions on local conditions and the nature of work according to the law, they are too broad and prone to disputes. Therefore, it was resolved at the 97th Bureau Affairs Meeting of this Bureau to review five standards for factory workers' working hours: (1) industries with international competition; (2) emerging industries; (3) industries with operational risks; (4) jobs that do not harm health; (5) extensions agreed upon by both labor and management. Only those that meet one of the above standards shall be allowed to extend working hours to ten hours per day, but the factory shall still be ordered to properly plan reduction methods within two years, to reach eight hours. Whether the proposal is appropriate should be prepared in writing and submitted, requesting your superior to review and instruct accordingly. Based on this, upon investigation, the five standards proposed by the Bureau for reviewing factory workers' working hours are related to the applicable laws and regulations, and should be inquired about for inspection and prompt reply, so as to instruct compliance, etc. Upon investigation, the first, second, and third items of the five standards proposed by the Bureau are still feasible. The fourth item should be corrected to "work that is light and does not harm health." The fifth item does not comply with Article 8 of the Factory Law and should not be approved for application. As for the original report stating that the factory should be ordered to properly plan reduction methods within two years to reach eight hours, according to the extension of working hours, it should be limited to cases where there is a necessary situation. If there is no necessary situation within a shorter period, it should be terminated at any time. Setting a uniform provision of two years would be inflexible and seems inappropriate. Approval is given for the previous inquiry. A corresponding response is made for inspection and instruction. This is addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>

<h3>Statement from the Shanghai Publishing Industry Union's Commercial Press Office</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Publishing Industry Union's Commercial Press Office, due to reports on the 8th of this month claiming the use of the name "Representatives of All Employees of the Commercial Press" and reports on the 9th claiming the names "Commercial Union, Commercial General Affairs Union," etc., to meet with peace conference representatives Wang, Wu, Cai, and others, specially issued the following statement yesterday (omitted above). The origin of this office and the political stance and propositions of the publishing industry union are briefly disclosed, hoping that people in society will pay attention. (1) The Origin of the Shanghai Publishing Industry Union's Commercial Press Office. The Commercial Press has approximately 4,000 employees in its four major departments in Shanghai: the printing plant, distribution office, general affairs department, and translation department. In 1925, the Printing Union, Distribution Office Employees' Union, General Affairs Department Association, and Translation Department Association were established separately. In 1927, when the Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai and the Union Unification Committee was formed, they were renamed the First Branch of the Commercial Press Union, the Third Branch of the Commercial Press Union, the Second Branch of the Commercial Press Union, and the Fourth Branch of the Commercial Press Union. In 1928, when the Second Central Committee established a Union Reorganization Committee, they were renamed the Commercial Press Union, the Commercial Press Distribution Office Employees' Union, the Commercial Press General Affairs Department Employees' Union, and the Commercial Press Translation Department Employees' Union. On February 28th of this year, they were reorganized into the Shanghai Publishing Industry Union's Commercial Press Office, which governs all employees in the four major departments of printing, distribution, general affairs, and editing. Its powers are purely internal. As for all external matters, the entire name of the publishing industry union is responsible for representation. This is because the publishing industry union has five offices under its jurisdiction, including this office, the China Book Company Office, and the World Book Company Office, with a total of more than 5,000 members. (2) The Political Position and Propositions of the Publishing Industry Union. The political stance of the publishing industry union can be found in the founding declaration, in the section on political aspects, excerpted as follows: "To seek the true liberation of the working masses, we must wait for the realization of true democratic politics. To seek the realization of true democratic politics, we must first seek the political status of the working masses. Because the emotions of the workers' revolution are the most intense, their power to promote politics is also the greatest. Politics is driven by revolutionary forces, not only is there no fear of regression, but there is also hope for progress. That is, our current urgent needs, such as (1) freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication, (2) the right to strike, (3) the right to vote and participate in politics, (4) the right to local autonomy, (5) the establishment of all other civil rights, etc., can only be thoroughly implemented and realized after the working masses have acquired political status. Then, people of all classes can enjoy equal political power in politics, and the embryo of true democratic politics can be formed, and even completely established, to achieve consolidation. This is not only the hope of the workers in this industry, but also the aspiration of workers in all industries in the city and the country. Therefore, what we want to obtain political status is for the masses, not for individuals. Violating this principle, everything is false. Departing from this spirit, even if we run around and shout, we can only exhaust our ability to shout, and there is no benefit to actual benefit. Their recent political propositions can also be found in the 'Declaration to Promote Peaceful Unification Conference' jointly issued by the Publishing Industry Union and various unions in this city, published in the Shen Xin and Xin Shen newspapers on October 30th of this year (not listed separately). It can be seen that the association is striving for democratic political efforts. (omitted below)</p>

Finally, the chairman expressed acceptance of the guidance and gave a thank-you speech, announcing the adjournment.</p>
<h3>Gu Kenfu Practices Law</h3>
<p>Mr. Gu Kenfu was one of the earliest initiators of Chinese-made films. Many of the older film stars graduated from his school. His directed films, such as "Human Heart" and "The Door of Justice," etc., were all able to use artistic techniques to create extraordinary and noble works. He occasionally wrote articles and published them in newspapers and magazines. His arguments were insightful, clear, and fluent, and were widely circulated at home and abroad. In the summer of 1929, he served as the editor of the art column of this newspaper and published ten special issues on art. His words and style were regarded as the best in Jilin at the time. Mr. Gu graduated from the Nanjing Prison School in the early years of the Republic of China, so he is proficient in law. When the National Revolutionary Army established its capital in Nanjing, Mr. Gu drafted a film promotion plan and visited Hu Zhantang, Ye Chucang, Chen Guofu, and other gentlemen, who praised him greatly. Unfortunately, due to economic difficulties at the time, it was not realized. Dr. He Shizhen, the younger brother of Dr. He Shimei, the former President of the Shanghai Concession Temporary Court, admired his talent and extended an invitation to assist him. All documents and files that passed through Mr. Gu's hands were praised. At the same time, Mr. Gu devoted himself to studying law at the Shanghai College of Political Science and Law, which was run by Dr. Zheng Yuxiu, to seek further education. His performance was excellent, and he always ranked at the top of the examinations. The Shanghai Municipal Party Department and the Shanghai Municipal Government successively appointed him as a member of the Film Review Committee. The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau also appointed him as an editor and a social affairs investigation committee member. The film review rules formulated by the former Shanghai Municipal Film Censorship Committee were mostly derived from Mr. Gu's hand. Now, Mr. Gu graduated from the Shanghai College of Political Science and Law this summer and obtained a Bachelor of Laws degree. He has joined the Shanghai Bar Association and, starting today, will practice as a lawyer in various courts in this city and the Jiangsu Higher Court, the Capital Supreme Court, and other regions. The law firm is located at Room 4, Huiluo Building, 106 Sichuan Road, this city. Mr. Zhang Baichun has been hired as the Director of General Affairs, Jia Licheng as the Director of Accounting, and Mr. Li Boqin as an assistant.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Recent Works by Modern Famous Painters</h3>
<p>▲Starts on the 13th</p>
<p>In recent years, painting exhibitions in Shanghai have sprung up like mushrooms after the rain, and the painting style is very popular. However, they are all collaborations by individuals or a small number of people, and there has never been a grand exhibition that brings together the best works of first-class masters. Now, reliable news has been received that Shanghai painters are planning to collaborate on an exhibition of recent works. The person in charge is Mr. Xue Baolun. Those invited by Mr. Xue to join include Wang Shizi, Wang Geshi, Wang Ziyuan, Jiang Xiaojian, Li Zuhan, Li Qiujun, Wang Shengyuan, Fang Huqing, Sun Xueni, Ma Qizhou, Ma Mengrong, Ma Wanli, Chen Xiaodie, Shang Shengbo, Fu Tienian, Zhang Shanzi, Zhang Daqian, Zhang Hongwei, Zhang Shimin, Xu Zhengbai, He Tianjian, Lu Xiaoman, Fei Longding, Huang Su'an, Huang Binhong, Huang Xiaoting, Huang Ainong, Ye Weishen, Yu Danhan, Zhao Shuju, Xiong Songquan, Zheng Wuchang, Zheng Manqing, Pan Tianshou, Liu Haisu, Zhu Wennyun, Lou Xinhu, Qian Shoushi, Xie Gongzhan, Yan Ganyuan, and other forty people. The works exhibited this time are all the proud works of the masters. Those who usually want to obtain their paintings but cannot easily do so can take this opportunity to choose at will. It is truly a rare opportunity. It is now scheduled to be exhibited at the Ningbo Fellow Association for three days starting on the 13th of this month. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

<h3>The Best-Selling Domestic Camel Hair from China's Only Factory</h3>
<p>The Shuanglu brand pure wool, plain-colored, wide and tight camel hair produced by China's only camel hair textile factory on Niuzhuang Road is made from high-quality wool purchased from the Northwest, spun and woven by itself. The products are of excellent quality and reasonably priced, and have long been recognized by society. It is heard that since the beginning of autumn this year, various woolen fabric stores have been placing orders with it. The factory has been processing and rushing to produce day and night, but there are still too many customers who come to buy every day.</p>
<h3>Post Office Closed the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration announced that the 12th of this month (Thursday) is the birthday of the Premier.

Finally, Chen Shancuo from the Research Department reported on the experimental results, and then the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>▲Correction: In the report on the 8th of this newspaper, the telegram sent by the preparatory meeting to all sectors of the country mentioned the "Central Political System Reform Plan," the principle of which was (1) to enable the five branches to independently and responsibly exercise their powers (the word "ministry" was mistaken for "people") in order to realize the spirit of the five-power system (the number "five" was mistaken for "people"). A correction is urgently needed.</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing in response to the article in your newspaper on the 4th of this month, in the local section, regarding Cheng Chunlin, also known as Yi Kun, which contained slanderous remarks. According to the company, namely the American-owned Sino-American Silver Company, it had already been established long ago. I only submitted my application through proper procedures on August 5th and was assigned to work as a clerk and translator (taking small notes and translating) under a Westerner, Mr. Li Yaoguang (Mr. Li does not understand Chinese). All the employees in the company were there before me, which is known to all colleagues in the company. Moreover, my boss, Mr. Li, is just an employee and has no right to interfere with the company's business, let alone his translator and note-taker. Now, your newspaper has groundlessly accused him, which is deeply regrettable. I hope you will immediately investigate and correct the matter to avoid being falsely accused. Yours sincerely, Cheng Chunlin, also known as Yi Kun, November 8th.</p>
<p>To the Editor of Shenbao:</p>
<p>I am writing to express my shock and surprise upon reading the list of union representatives who went to 29 Gordon Road, Wu's residence, to petition, as published in your newspaper on the 9th, which included the name of the Nanyang Company Employees' Comrades Association. The Nanyang Company Employees' Comrades Association had a labor dispute some years ago and was voluntarily dissolved by all our workers. Currently, all our workers are well-treated by the management and the factory regulations are excellent, so we do not want to form any organization, nor do we have any representatives active outside. The name "Nanyang Company Employees' Comrades Association" as published in your newspaper is completely inconsistent with the facts. I am writing this letter specifically to declare this and request that you publish this letter (in the Letters to the Editor column) to clarify the truth. Yours sincerely, All 5,000+ employees of Nanyang Company.</p>
<p>On the 4th of this month, your newspaper published a telegram from Jiangsu Province party members urging peace. At the end of the telegram, the names of Xu Shaolie and Yan Huading, etc., party members from Kunshan County, were listed. Shaolie and Huading were completely unaware of this telegram. We are writing to request that your newspaper promptly correct this to clarify the facts and rectify public opinion. Sincerely, Xu Shaolie and Yan Huading, party members from Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, issued on November 8th, 1931.</p>
<p>To All Newspapers:</p>
<p>Yesterday, we read in your newspaper about the telegram from Jiangsu Province party members urging peace, which included the names Zhang Gang, Fan Jingda, and Xu Houfu, etc., party members from Chuansha County. We were shocked and surprised. We were not aware of this telegram beforehand, which clearly indicates that someone has fabricated names and included them. We are writing this letter specifically to correct this. Zhang Gang, Fan Jingda, and Xu Houfu, party members from Chuansha County, respectfully.</p>

<h3>Save the Nation! The People Must Rise Up!</h3>
<p>Yi Yin</p>
<p>Napoleon said, "I am not afraid in front of a million soldiers, but I am afraid in front of a million people. I am at a loss for what to do." It can be seen that the power of the people is extraordinary. However, our Chinese people, to put it politely, are a peace-loving nation. To put it bluntly, they are a weak and useless nation. If not, in this unprecedented national crisis of humiliation, how can we not hear the voices of the majority of the people? One reason, of course, is that the people do not have sufficient knowledge. Another reason is that those patriots who shout for salvation refuse to go to the ranks of the common people. Therefore, the national salvation work that is booming in big cities is something that the rural people do not know what is going on. Our country is based on agriculture, and most of the people are scattered in the poor and remote villages. They are like sleeping in a drum. They are people who have not directly suffered pain, and they are still living their lives of "working at sunrise and resting at sunset." Therefore, if we want to have the strength to resist Japan and save the country, the first thing we must do is to go to the ranks of the common people to awaken them. Napoleon said, "There is a giant in the northeast. He is sleeping now, but do not wake him up. If he wakes up, he will become as strong as a lion." It can be seen that our people, once everyone wakes up, will not only make Japan fear, but also make all countries in the world fear. Therefore, awakening the people is the most important thing for future prosperity. The second is to lead the people. Now, the people are not all knowledgeable, so those who are more knowledgeable should be responsible for leading the people, telling them how to save the country, and walking on the same reasonable path. The third is to unite the people. Outsiders say that our nation is like scattered sand, but we must avoid this problem in the future and turn the 400 million scattered sand into a large stone, then our strength will be enough to apply. The first element of nation-building is the people, so to ensure the existence of the country, we must not forget the people at any time and in any place. I believe that only when the people rise up themselves can we avenge our hatred. If we rely on others, we will inevitably be trapped in a deep and inextricable position. Compatriots, rise up! Only when we rise up ourselves can we break our chains.</p>

<h3>Foch's War Diary of the French General in the European War</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>What was the situation on the east side of the Meuse River?</p>
<p>From October 8th to 10th, the French 17th Regiment, with the support of two American divisions (33rd and 29th), fought along the right bank of the Meuse River, while the main force of the American army attacked on the left bank. After fierce battles, they advanced to the Sivry-Buzancy line. After that, the American offensive encountered stubborn resistance from the enemy, and they felt that their forces were insufficient to defeat the enemy. The enemy seemed determined to hold the right bank of the Meuse River firmly, as this was the only way to cover the retreat of the defeated armies on the right flank and in the center.</p>
<p>In order to break the enemy's plan, the Allied Commander-in-Chief decided to advance towards Luxembourg along both banks of the Moselle River, and at the same time fight along both banks of the Saar River.</p>
<p>On October 20th, I sent the following instructions to Commander Pétain:</p>
<p>The current operational plan focuses on repelling the enemy to the area below Stenay on the Meuse River. To break through the enemy's defensive line on the Meuse River, preparations must be made to advance towards Luxembourg and the Saar River on both the east and west sides of the Moselle River.</p>
<p>Of the enemy forces guarding the defense line, there are 127 divisions west of the Meuse River, but no more than 32 divisions east of the Meuse River. Therefore, the speed of victory after the offensive depends on the speed of the deployment.</p>
<p>After the enemy loses the main transverse railway line from Metz to Sedan, our victory will be even more assured. Therefore, the French troops withdrawn after the shortening of our front line should be immediately sent to the Lorraine front on both sides of the Moselle River, because our strength and terrain in that area are conducive to a swift battle.</p>
<p>The deployment and participation of the American troops advancing on the left bank of the Meuse River should also be studied.</p>
<p>The Intelligence Department of the French General Headquarters detected that the German forces on both sides of Attigny were not evenly distributed. Once the railway line between Hirson and Mézières is lost, the German High Command will have no hope of restoring this balance. Therefore, we have more reason to decide to attack in the Moselle area. This offensive is not a surprise attack, as the enemy has been stationed in this area for a long time and knows that we will eventually attack sooner or later.</p>
<p>I had already discussed this with the commander of the German Eighth Army (General Chraulde) on September 20th. Commander Pétain had also notified Commander Castelnau a month ago to arrange for the group army headquarters to launch a joint attack.</p>
<p>On October 21st, the French Commander-in-Chief sent me the plan for the general offensive in the Lorraine area. This plan was generally correct, but there were some problems with its swift implementation, especially the operational plan west of the Moselle River, which failed to take advantage of the enemy's weaknesses to seize the opportunity for a quick battle. The situation east of the Moselle River was slightly better. I decided to immediately deploy all available forces to fight in that area first.</p>
<p>I temporarily abandoned the plan to attack Luxembourg and limited the scope of the original plan. However, from a military standpoint, I still wanted to use a small force to break through the defense zone that the enemy had established for four years. More importantly, from a spiritual standpoint, I wanted to be the first to enter enemy territory.</p>
<p>I asked Commander Pétain to prepare to attack towards Saint-Avold and Saarbrücken. On October 25th, he reported to me that the offensive would begin around November 15th. He also explained the source of the large forces required.</p>
<p>On the 27th, he designated the attacking units and the objectives of the attack for General Castelnau, the commander of the Eastern Army Group. The forces responsible for the attack were the Eighth (Commander Chraulde) and Tenth (Commander Michaud) Corps. The Eighth Corps had already been deployed to the front line, and the Tenth Corps had to move east from the Aisne River line and be positioned between the American Second Corps and the French Eighth Corps. The combat troops consisted of twenty infantry divisions (including four or five American divisions), ten to twelve field artillery regiments, one hundred and eighty to two hundred heavy artillery pieces, three light tank regiments, two medium tank companies, one cavalry regiment, and one air squadron. Commander Pétain stated in the military order that this was not a relentless direct attack on the enemy's defensive line, but rather a tactic.</p>
<p>The French Commander-in-Chief wanted several American divisions under his command. The American Second Corps was designated to protect Metz, (unfinished)</p>

<h3>Little Host</h3>
<p>— Gao Sang</p>
<p>││The one who wins is Jinan beating Northenburg││</p>
<p>The school's sports department posted a notice that the football team would be playing Northenburg today. When two heroes meet, there will inevitably be a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Therefore, no one wanted to listen to the lectures in the classroom. Although our school is the base camp of the iron football team, we rarely see their achievements on the field on weekdays. Once the formal battle begins, we will naturally be especially eager. You invite me, I invite you, and the whole school is in great tension.</p>
<p>Under such a tense mood, Mr. Wang insisted on being a little host with me. Mr. Wang is a semi-fan. He said that Jinan is unreliable, who is sick, who is not studying, and seven out of ten are bound to lose. I didn't care, the victory or defeat will eventually have a result. Because Mr. Wang made such a prediction, I simply returned him with disbelief, and even said that Jinan will definitely win. Thus, the dispute began, and the two-mao bet was settled. We also asked Mr. Zhou to witness, so as not to be lazy afterwards.</p>
<p>The agreement was made in the morning, and the game was in the afternoon. For the sake of two mao, I earned a lot of warnings from Mr. Zhou. He said that if anyone lost and didn't pay up, he would definitely use force to resolve it, with the air of the League of Nations artillery. But he was also too unfair, just as if he was saying to me, "Is Jinan definitely going to lose?" I thought so in my heart, hoping that Jinan would win and retaliate against them.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the afternoon arrived, but we still had to attend classes. Carrying several pounds of foreign books, we inevitably had to be refined. Walking into the classroom, I saw that the students all looked impatient, but the time had not yet arrived, and they were unwilling to sacrifice themselves in vain. Mr. Pang came, silence, take notes. This year, I missed classes due to anti-Japanese activities, so I hurried to catch up. My pen was writing on the paper, but today I missed a lot. One sentence passed, I couldn't catch up. I looked at the classmate next to me to see if he had taken notes, but as soon as I looked, another sentence passed. So I had to let it go. The more I took notes, the worse it became.</p>
<p>Fortunately, class was over. Two mao was a small matter, but I didn't want to be angry. I didn't even have time to send the books to my room, so I ran to the field. There were too many people and I couldn't squeeze in. After turning half a circle, Mr. Wang and Mr. Zhou were occupying a stool in the left corner, leaving a seat for me, I thought it was for the sake of two mao. So I was very happy to get a commanding position. Mr. Zhou and Mr. Wang looked at me, inevitably getting angry again.</p>
<p>The north wind was blowing, the leaves were rustling. The wind behind me was blowing very hard, and fallen leaves flew onto my hair from time to time. The heads were crowded, and the Boy Scouts were blocking left and right, quite like the so-called "helping the scene" in playing tricks. Every time a bus arrived, the fans rushed desperately, like mountains and seas overturning, or like the north wind rolling fallen leaves.</p>
<p>It started. Northenburg was the British Royal Army, and everyone was tall and mighty, with an air of arrogance. Jinan, known as the iron army, had warriors of mixed yellow and black colors, short and lean, with the spirit of the Far East. As you came and I went, the white army gradually turned red, and the yellow army gradually turned white. The struggle was fierce.</p>
<p>Jinan was kicking against the wind, and the ball was naturally always in the backfield. The secret struggle between Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhou, and me was temporarily suspended. We stretched our necks and each had our own ideas.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a ball was shot towards Jinan's goal. The goalkeeper did not resist, but gently brushed the ball, as if saying something sarcastic. The ball honestly and politely entered the goal. So the whole field sighed. Mr. Wang and Mr. Zhou were the same, but when we looked at each other, they smiled slightly. I understood their thoughts.</p>
<p>It came again. Northenburg's goal was also broken by Jinan. The whole field cheered. Mr. Wang and Mr. Zhou were the same, but when we looked at each other, they smiled slightly. I understood their thoughts.</p>
<p>In this way, Jinan's goal was repeatedly opened, three to one. The white army defeated the yellow army, and the first half ended. The whole field was dim.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's artillery was fired. He thought that the two mao were securely in hand, so he discussed with Mr. Zhou how to enjoy it. Mr. Zhou said to sit in the West Garden, a pack of melon seeds, two cups of coffee, just enough. Mr. Wang agreed, first declaring that the loser could not participate. I ignored them. The money was in my pocket, anyway, if they used force, I would run away. It was already a matter of course. At the same time, the game was not over, and it was difficult for them to issue an ultimatum immediately.</p>
<p>Ten minutes passed in a flash. Jinan's players rushed to the windward side to prepare to avenge their shame. The north wind was howling again, and the air was tense.</p>
<p>General Da Gai shot one into the British army. We smiled at each other. General Da Gai shot two into the British army. We smiled at each other. At this point, I thought that no one would win the two mao. In my joy, I formally gave them a blank stare. Mr. Zhou said, "Mr. Gao can rest assured, and there is no need to run away." I said, "Who is running?" "Can't afford to lose two mao?" This is a hard line of duty.</p>
<p>General Da Gai finally shot in the third one. The whole field roared like thunder. Mr. Wang threw Mr. Zhou's hat into the air to celebrate. But I caught it smoothly and stuffed it into my bag. The condition was there, but at that time the game was not over, and the situation was constantly changing. Mr. Zhou negotiated with Mr. Wang, asking why he threw his hat. Mr. Wang asked me for it, and I first said "Two mao for a small foreign coin".</p>
<p>It was over. A burst of welcome, the fans rushed back to the school, rushing to the outside of the school. Although Jinan's players were wounded, they were smiling and went home to change clothes.</p>
<p>The north wind did not continue to blow. Mr. Zhou's bald head became hairy. He urgently needed a hat. But I didn't give it. Mr. Wang was silent, admitting defeat. Finally, Mr. Zhou asked him for the two mao, but he didn't give it to me. The condition was to share the blessings. Mr. Zhou straightened his hair. Mr. Wang talked about today's football experience. They went to the West Garden together, three cups of coffee. They couldn't eat the melon seeds, so they each ate a small piece of beef. Because of the mess in his hair, although I returned the hat to him, he still demanded compensation for the loss. I said, "You are eating for free, just like the League of Nations."</p>
<h3>Two Classes</h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>The first class in the afternoon was the troublesome chemistry class. The chemistry teacher was a middle-aged man with heart disease and rheumatism. When he came to class, he slowly walked out of the teacher's room, almost staggering with every step. Looking at his appearance, he seemed to have lung disease. He walked into the classroom, coughed a few times, and then weakly put down the roll book. His two pale and listless eyes glanced around, and then he raised his voice to call the roll.</p>
<p>It's really funny. Today, no one was listening quietly. It happened that there was no experiment, so there was even less interest. The students in the classroom were all doing their own work, like a self-study room. Some people even used it as a dormitory. The teacher was sitting upright in his chair and lecturing, but he didn't care how noisy we were.</p>
<p>Finally, the bell rang to end the class. The teacher took his book and roll book and slowly walked out of the classroom.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○</p>
<p>The next class was trigonometry. Mr. Hong hurriedly ran into the classroom. He was somewhat short-sighted and extremely sensitive to sound. He didn't allow us to talk, and he didn't allow us to look at other people's papers. If he saw someone talking, he would tear up their paper. When everyone heard this, they made faces at each other, not even daring to make a sound. At first, the teacher walked back and forth, monitoring us as if afraid that we would cheat. Later, he sat down casually, and then the cheating began.</p>
<p>Yun, sitting in the third row, coughed a few times to Juan, sitting in the fifth row, and then raised her thumb and shook it a few times. Juan understood her meaning and nodded, crumpled up her finished draft paper, glanced at the teacher, made a face at him, and then quickly threw it to Yun.</p>
<p>This class was really quiet. The teacher quietly sat in his chair and read the newspaper. We were also very quiet, not saying a word, but there were continuous coughs, as if everyone had caught a temporary cold.</p>
<p>Before an hour had passed, the papers had been handed in. Everyone jumped out of the classroom laughing and joking, leaving only the teacher in the classroom sorting the scattered papers on the desk. Then he hurriedly rushed out of the classroom.</p>
