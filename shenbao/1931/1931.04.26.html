<p>英外相漢德森氏謂歐戰前之外交。爲利己主義。歐戰後之外交。爲和解與合作主義。現在正在兩種主義過渡階級中。並謂公斷與軍縮。爲當今極關緊要之事。僅僅公斷尤未能使和平穩固云云。</p>
<p>夫外交而欲使其國不取利己主義。固爲難能之事。因國中之人。無有不愛其國者。苟不利己。則必爲其國民所反對。故余謂外交之中。而欲不專屬利己主義。第一必先使其國民之多數。知世界之大勢。而後不至爲暫時或一隅之利己所限。結果反至不利己而害己。歐洲大戰之結果。即爲此也。第二必使國中之人。不忸於以前因襲而來之非分權利。認爲己所應得。而固守不舍。蓋外表言之。己之不應得之利。即爲人之不應受之害。以精深言之。舍棄其不應得之利。又未始非己眞實之利。權利之應當與否。應由其事之原理而判。不應由以前之久假不歸。或侵略而來。即據爲己有。一旦舍棄。即謂於己不利也。</p>

<p>我國之航空事業、自最初創辦迄今、已歷二十年矣、中間因迭經戰亂、在軍用方面、無論飛機人才、及地下之設備、大抵旋興旋替、迄無若何進步之可言、截至現時止、以言空軍之配備、則中央所有飛機、新舊合計、尙不及百架、且須因陋就簡、一種型式之機、往往以之供各種工作之用、以言防空設備則不僅各省城市、即首都重地、及各要港堡壘、亦無暇計及、以言航空行政、則機關旣迄未獨立、法令亦多未頒行、以言航空教育、則以前僅於中央軍校草創設立一班、人不滿百、今雖已獨立、然方針待决、造就仍復需時、以言製造工業、則國內一般工業不振、機器原料一時無由自給、重以人才缺乏、尤覺難能、以言地下設備、則中央所有機塲不過二十餘所、且類多狹小、而附屬建築物、又多付缺如、航路航燈、更從未計及、以言民用航空、則僅有兩個外資合辦之郵運公司、共有飛機尙不滿二十架、以言航空之保障安全、則原有氣象事業並不發達、航空氣象更未興辦、航務專用電台及標誌、亦未計及、以言航空設施能力、則航空經費、每月總計不過十餘萬元、尙不及陸軍百分之一、其幼稚情形如此、然而自國民革命軍出師北伐、以至最近討閻剿共之役、空軍無役不從、其所著功效戰績、固昭眧在人耳目、而尤其在最近討閻諸役、威力尤大、此亦足見空軍之功用、縱使規模極小、亦能獲收偉效、而中國航空公司在茲創辦之始、僅將郵運爲收入、已月入四五萬元、此又足見民用航空之大有可爲、不過以與世界列强比較、相去又無乃太遠、最低限度、亦應使我國對於空中有自衛之能力、故會衆以爲力謀航空之發展、實今日最切要之圖、</p>
<p>發展航空之道維何、一曰空軍宜從速擴充也、我國現有之空軍、與人相衡、論數量不及十一、論質量則幾等於零、故會衆認爲亟須分別功能種類、擴充完整、二曰防空設備宜從速配置也、防空之設備、較之防護海陸之港堡、需費極輕、而空道無險阻之限制、無處不爲門戶、可以直達腹心、故會衆以爲中央乃至各地、均須極力籌謀、以免臨渴掘井、三曰航空行政宜從速决方針也、航空行政之機關與事權、如不確定、航空重要法令如不頒定、則領導獎勵無所依憑、遑言發展、故會衆以爲應請中央權宜需要、本諸理論、於最近將來確定航空行政在中央之統一、四日培育航空人材、宜速積極進行也、人才之準備與其他設備異、勢必餋之於前、而後可以致用、會衆以爲航空學校應及時積極進行、尤須收錄全國各地之學生、以資普遍、並應拔選優才、出國深造、推廣航空圖書文字之宣傳、訂入中小學之課程、以灌輸航空知識、喚起民衆對航空之認識、五曰航空製造工業、宜速謀發達也、在過去中央滬廠海軍及廣東航空處對於航空製造、均不無成績、然究嫌片段支離、費大功薄、會衆以爲在目前應遵照先總理利用外資之原則、與之合作、以彌縫國內機器原料人才之缺乏、同時從事於研究之組織與設備、並應請政府設法推進一般工業、開發燃油、以爲將來完全自給之準備、六曰航空之地下設備、宜速謀普遍完備也、我國幅員人口均大於美國、而我國僅有機場二十餘所、美國則空港數百、機場五千、夜航設備、及航路完美、爲世界冠、考美國地下設備如此其盛、皆各地方自動努力之結果、中央及各州政府所費實寥寥無多、故會衆以爲我國之地下設備、亦應由各地在中央主管機關指導之下、共同努力、自動集資、籌辦機塲、廣敷標誌、不僅航線之發展、裨益各地之交通文化匪輕、即就消極方面言、是亦防空設備之一端、實不可怠忽者也、七曰民用航空宜速推廣也、現時國內之民用航空、僅有郵運一種、且航線不過三條、又多外資參合、其他民用、則尙未興辦、會衆希望其他政府機關及一般商民、於本國航空製造開始之時、立即設法運用航空於各方面、並確定准允商辦航空之原則、以開發經營、及使用航空之投資、然後民用航空方可望長足之發展、八曰航空保障安全之政策、宜速爲確定也、就保障言、會衆以爲軍民航空人員之待遇、應互爲參攷、妥爲訂定改善、使之有鼓勵激勸之功效、對於保險事業、應注意取締補助、使之無阻滯航空發展之弊害、就安全言、會衆以為應將氣象通訊事業、分別增加擴充、並應特製航空地圖、使之合於航空之需要、航空器之良窳、人員之技術、地下設備之妥否、均應由主管機關妥為檢定、隨時注意查察、是皆直接關係於整個航空事業之隆替者也、九日航空經費宜速即設法增加也、中央航空經費、每月不過十餘萬元、以此供養千數人員、並維持補充之需、一併在內、航空之消費極多、折耗最大、以此區區之數、不僅無以發展、且有衰壞之虞、故會衆以爲就令國庫空虛、航空經費一時不能如英國遽增列至數萬萬之鉅、然亦不妨就百餘倍之陸軍經費之中、略事裁减、以益空軍、及一般航空之各種設備、此又當促請政府斷然採納施行者也、</p>

<h3>廣九車出軌之慘劇</h3>
<p>搭客共一百五六十人</p>
<p>已救出者僅三十餘人</p>
<p>香港通信、廣九鐵路、由廣州至深圳者爲華段、由深圳至香港之九龍者爲英段、昨（二十）日下午四時三十九分鐘、由深圳開行來港之十九次客車、計拖車輛五乘、車頭之後、爲頭等車一乘、次爲二等車一乘、其餘三乘則爲三等車、五時零一分行抵大埔站、停一分鐘、五時二分繼續向九龍駛進、詎行至沙田附近之第三號隧道、竟告出軌、時五時十五分也、茲將肇事情形、調查如下、</p>
<p>（失事地點）　失事地點屬於新界之大埔、左爲海、名馬漏水、右爲山、山與鐵路之間有一坑、名赤蘭坑、火車到此時、須經第三號遂道、鐵道係由海與山坑之間築起甚高、如一堤壩、此次失事、車頭墮於赤蘭坑、</p>
<p>（失事原因）　此次失事、其原因以連日大雨、冲去鐵路堤壩下之沙石、該路之上部已鬆浮、而此處之鐵軌、又爲駁口、故其承力已弱、該車抵達此處、其力一壓、路及鐵軌皆失其承載之力、由是失事、蓋該車到此、路基即卸也、</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>（傷亡人數）　查此次失事之客車、共載有乘客約一百五六十人、頭等車甚少、二等十餘人、餘俱爲三等搭客、即晚已有傷者十七人救出、此十七人皆傷面部、其未有受傷而逃出者、不上十人、最慘者則有小學生二十餘人、由大埔上車、不意竟遇此難、又間有廣州政界兩人、亦乘此車、但未救出、</p>
<p>（車傾坑中）　該車失事後、車頭側倒、脫軌而出、連日天雨滂沱、山下泥土已鬆、該車頭因墜坑力速、繼向山邊傾覆、車頭脫離頭等車約數十碼、烟通向山邊、頭等車廂全毀、其中搭客甚少、深信該車廂中各人均遭慘斃、二等車廂肇事時尙未陷下、故二等搭客倖獲逃生、惟未久、該車廂亦倒側、三等車廂之第一架、因隨第二等車後、故向二等車廂底撞下、全架毀爛、亦倒山旁、第二架之車廂亦毀、尾後之車廂亦毀前部、後部則保全、</p>
<p>（施救情形）　香港方面、得到廣九車失事消息、即由九龍總站長、租賃長途車十餘輛、出發前往施救、並預備將該車搭客載運回港、尖沙咀警署、亦知會尖沙咀滅火局、先行派出兩乘十字車前往、並加派滅火機兩乘前去相助、蓋當時各人尙未知遇事地點之情形也、至八時許、復再派貨車四輛出發、計由總站派出車輛約二十餘輛之多、各車到肇事地點後、均忙於向撞毀之車廂內設法將被壓着之傷者施救、被壓斃在車下者、觸目皆是、情形甚慘、又聞頭等車中搭客、絕無一人救出、想已全殞矣、至各隊員將傷者掘出後、先用帆布床安臥地上、然後派人逐個沿車路扛出大路、再用汽車接運至沙田、轉十字車送往醫院救治、惟救傷人員、由港到者、因不敷用、遂在附近僱請土人數十名、帮同施救、並將各物移去、澈夜工作、二十一日仍未完畢、而沙田附近之路軌、亦因雨水過多而毀壞、而失事地點之處、非將各爛車及屍骸等移去、不能將車路修理、即使開工修理、亦非旬日不能竣工、</p>
<p>（路局損失）　此次乘客損失、未能詳查惟路局損失、據路局職員談稱、該車頭値銀十餘萬元、另車輛數架、每架値數千元、此次損失不下二十萬元、至將來修理鐵路費、尙不在內、</p>
<p>（交通暫停）　是晚廣九直通快車由港赴省者至大埔站即行停止、所有搭客、由路局加派汽車、從下路元朗方面、前往接載返港、其由廣州開來之快車、車次深圳、亦即停止前進、二十一日赴廣九直通快車、則暫行停開、以俟鐵路修復、當經路局布告各界週知矣、（二十一日）</p>
<h3>中東路窘象畢露</h3>
<p>除厲行裁員减薪外</p>
<p>又創五日勞動週制</p>
<p>哈爾濱通信、中東路以營業不振、今歲已施行緊縮政策三項、惟入不敷出、依然如故、四月份之員工薪金、按之鐵路規定、每不俟月底、即於十五日開始發放、其最後一批得者亦不出三十日、今則分文未發、其各處臨時預算職員、有三月未得支薪者、俄局長魯德意於本月十六日下令、對於各處一七五一筆臨時預算、核减十分之九、其原支三千鲁布者、祇留二百五十魯布、用人多寡、及裁員數目、聽各處處長之便、按一七五預算所用、悉爲華方臨時職員、祇以總務處而論、已有二十八名、以核减關係、至少須裁去二十四五名、總計各處被裁之華員、至少在四百名以上、論公則此一批華員被裁、當歸咎於本人命運不濟、論私則如一七五之臨時預算正多、何俄局長不裁减他項、蓋他項臨時預算、均屬關係俄員者、所以不减、亦可謂私心自用矣、俄局長近又向理事會建議、謂鐵路今後如果營業仍然不振、則實行每人給假一月、假期內不支薪俸、如此則本年度可省却一個月薪水開支、數目約爲六百萬魯布、理事會尙未審核、倘今後路方營業仍無起色、恐此議勢將實行也、現理事會中又有核减全路職工薪水之議案、除以前已減二成外、恐須再减一成、此案因担任預算之華理事鄒尙友在津、未得開會討論、鄒歸來後當可决定、至於鐵路總工廠、工人原額爲二千五百餘名、內華工一千四百餘名、俄工九百餘名、近經兩次裁减、華工只勝九百餘名、俄工八百餘名、自本月十五日起、又施行五日勞動週制、即每週工作五日、休息二日、據俄局長宣稱、施行此制、係爲節省工資、維持不减政裁工辦法、但此法純爲蘇聯制度、哈埠工廠林立、工人極多、東鐵首創此制、其用意尤覺叵測也、（十九日）</p>

<h3>决賽情形</h3>
<p>男子甲組铅球　昨日最受天雨影響者、莫如鉛球、球濕而滑、捉摸不住、而着地黏泥、即揩刷亦甚不易、更若者地滑、轉身頗滑、故參加者雖二十人、成績皆平平而已、曁南謝全和第一、只十一米五一、餘三名、皆不及十一米、</p>
<p>男子乙組鉛球　乙組鉛球、亦如男子之因天雨而改色、八磅鉛球、第一名南洋模範鄧應源僅得九米八一、於决賽第三次中得之、南方林宗茂差０·一０米居第二、於最後三次决賽、大半無成績、殊爲可惜、</p>

<p>女子組替換跑　女子四百米替換跑、參加者四校、務本薛志潔之第一棒、一衝居先、形勢甚佳、惜第一棒後、一蹶不振、東亞猛追趕上、盛璧第三棒後、已穩得第一矣、結果東南得第二、中國第三、務本殿軍、</p>

<p>公共租界之初期歷史、經槪括叙述、其演進之跡、亦經追溯、自一八四三年之蕞爾始基起、至今日之廣大與重要爲止、公共租界內所有之外僑、其初爲數甚少、一八四九年僅一七五人、一八五五年二四三人、至一八七六年、乃達一五八一人、自是日增、洎乎今日、公共租界之內、計有外僑二六九六五人、包括界外馬路區域計算、共有三六四七一人、其所代表之國籍、不下四十有二、在太平軍變亂初期之內、上海縣城曾被攻取、時爲一八五三年、中國人民、相率避難於現時所謂公共租界、結果、使租界性質爲之改變、此項改變之重要、報告內亦經提及、先是租界內僅有華人約五百名、但至此時、避難華民之擁入租界者、達二萬名、界內外僑爲數旣少、如欲屏而不納、非特勢有不能、抑且顯違人道、華人一經在租界內定居、中外雙方、均獲其利、地方之安寗良好、以及富於經商與求覓工作之機遇、此爲華人之利、將土地租與避難之華民、或爲建築居住之屋宇、並使租界之因有華民、得以奮興發展、馴至茂盛、此爲外僑之利、報告進而表示、一八五三年與一八五四年之情事、曾經重演於一八六０年至一八六二年、且其規模更爲擴大、緣其時太平軍在近滬一帶活動、發生內戰、使難民又紛紛遷居現時所謂公共租界、約計有五十萬人、此項約計數目、或包括彼時暫居法租界者而言、雖在一八六四年太平軍潰敗以後、租界內之華民、頗多徙居他處、但據一八七0年之戶口調查、現時所謂公共租界、尙有華民七萬五千名以上、是後逐漸增加、至於今日、約近一百萬名、現時公共租界市府之起源、與一八五三年及一八五四年之事變有關、報告內對於此項關係、經引述一八五四年之界內外僑會議紀錄、以資證明、蓋當事變發生之時、各該外僑、曾經舉行有歷史價値之會議、以籌畫保護租界所必需之切實辦法、而英國領事愛爾可克君、亦於開會之時、將所提議、加以說明、所提維何、即將市府之組織法與新地產章程合爲一體、以代替一八四五年上海道與英領事所訂之舊章、報告繼續表示、西歷一八五三年及一八五四年之事件、如何直接或間接造成一種特別主義、而使現時所謂公共租界、因其特殊地位、應享有左列之權、即（一）防衛權、爲自衛起見、租界有採用切實辦法、以抵禦侵入或被襲擊之權、（二）武裝中立權、中國有內戰時、租界有維持武裝中立態度之權、（三）拒絕華人武裝軍隊出入租界之權、此即要求各方將帥、包括中國政府之將帥在內、無論平時或戰時、須駐軍於租界以外、藉以尊重其中立、爲行使防衛權起見、租界內之外僑要求、依據自衛公例、租界應有自衛以防外力攻擊危險之權、並得因此組織并給餋一種常備軍、（即萬國商團）遇必要時、並得召集各國海陸軍隊、以爲後援、租界之歷史表示、往昔曾有數次、因有兩軍在租界附近交綏、以致發生危險、賴有防衛及武裝中立之權、得以自衛、</p>
<p>第三章追溯地產章程之歷史　自一八五四年經上海道同意公布之新地產章程起、此項章程、包括租界之組織法在內、其中規定甚不完備、迨至一八六六年、租界之租地人、復提出一種新地產章程、其後至一八六九年、經北京各國公使批准、於是租界內、始設有如現時之統治機關、一八六九年之地產章程、屢經試加修改、以未得北京各國公使及中國政府之核准、迄無成議、結果爲今日之公共租界、大體仍受治於一八六六年地產章程之下、公共租界之地位槪述如左、今日之公共租界、在實際上、仍受治於一八六六年所定之組織法、其時之租界面積、不及今日三分之一、約有外僑二千二百人、華民約九萬人、而今日則外僑增至二萬六千九百六十五人、華民達九十七萬一千三百九十七人、即其細則、自一八六六年以來、亦經極少之修改、一八九八年曾修正兩項、嗣又修正五六項、然因訂立新細則所需運用之機關、旣不靈便、而有關係之政府、爲數又多、每使修正細則之手續深感困難、且無把握、如下文所述、以目前之治制及細則、而應付六十年來大見進展之新情勢、其不能使工部局及納稅人之游刄有餘、事無足怪、顧此項治制、原爲適應當時社會之需要而設、彼時社會之大小及性質、與經如許年代演進而成之現時社會、大相懸殊、但仍能成就如許、或亦可謂難能可貴、第四章簡括說明兩點（一）包括於地產章程內之組織法、爲一八六九年所批准者、此項章程、內有數欵、業經修改、現仍繼續施行、（二）組織法所根據之原則、其數有二、一曰自治、一曰法治、此二原則、爲自由制度之特色、在英美及接受同樣政治理想之各國所經成立者、後經分別槪論如左、（一）自治、公共租界之統治、以有資格投票人之意志爲根據、此項意志、藉投票人之公開會議或工部局而表示、該局爲一行政機關、爲投票人所選舉之代表組織而成、其代投票人之行使職權、須對於投票人負責、（二）法治、工部局僅爲根據組織法而產生之一種機關、並非爲一種獨斷之官廳、而有廣大無限之權力、賦與工部局之統治權、均規定於成文之組織法內、該局自身無權變更、且其行使職權之時、務須遵守組織法內所開列之某某條件、法院離開工部局之職權而獨立、但該局則須完全受法院之控制、倘工部局對於任何居民個人、或任何業主、有所控訴、必須經由相當之法院、方能執行其要求、倘任何個人、因工部局行使其職權而受損害、向特設之法院有所控訴、工部局亦不能置之不理、下列諸節、專論以此二原則爲根據之組織法、施行於公共租界內所發生之各項問題、在少數之外僑社會內、其中大都爲英美二國商民、如居留於上海公共租界內者、其採用此二種原則、爲組織市府計畫之根據、以適應其需要、並無可以奇異之處、若輩迫於情勢、而採用一種組織市府之計畫、俾得一致行動、以達其共同之目的、故於一八五四年、首先採取一種辦法、與其本國所習見之規模略相髣髴者、至一八六六年、復經淬厲而改良之當時之情勢、不獨爲若輩所未嘗見、抑且獨一而無二、乃在此情勢之下、竟能致力、以實行其習慣之組織、斯爲奇特耳、少數西國商民團體、在此種組織之下、不特須供給有限制之市政需要、且對於公共租界內日見增加之華民、亦須擔承管理與保護之大部份責任、故華民之在公共租界、一方面固能增加界內之興盛、而一方面則使租界問題因而複雜、行政規模異常擴大、日積月累之後、由少數外商所選舉之工部局、乃在東方大城內人烟最密而最繁盛之一部份、執行其警衛及行政之職務、而享有市政特權之納稅西人、則僅居界內全部居民之一小部份、然則外僑所定組織法內所包括之原則、將如何適用於華民、應採用何種之必需辦法、而使工部局之於界內華民、能實行其職權、工部局之對於界外中國官廳、關係如何、界內之中外居民、因情勢之需求、在市政制度方面、其須有一種方式之協力經營、已爲不可避免之事、但協力之條件又將如何、各部分之租界居民團體、對於市政稅收之應負義務、以及對於所辦市政利益、其所應分享之相對權利、各將以何種標準、爲之斟酌損益、凡此諸端、均爲已經造成之奇特情勢所牽涉之問題、各該問題之眞相、不能預知、惟有經過相當之閱歷、而後能逐漸表露、解决此項問題之進行、緩而且難、其間障礙、爲多數之複雜主要原因、即此可見、過去雖已見進步、然尙未達終點、其歷程距完滿時期尙遠、故欲明了今日之情勢、以及逆料將來之狀况、對於其間之較爲重要時期、有追溯之必要、詳見以下三章、</p>
<p>第五第六兩章之所論列者、爲組織法內所包括之自治法治二原則、如何歷經施行於公共租界內之華民、第五章專論法治、表示各時期內工部局與中國官廳間所發生之困難、根本係由於雙方之統治原則、完全相反、一方面代表獨裁制度、一方面代表法治制度、公共租界之工部局、行使其依照組織法所規定之有限職權、並須受獨立法院之控制、至於中國地方官（即道台）所代表之中國官廳、其所行使之職權、係屬獨裁性質、並無任何規定之法律限制、不受法院控制、而反控制法院、工部局職權之與中國當道職權相反者以此、無限制之獨裁職權、與有限制之法定職權、不能共同存在、亦不能由兩獨立機關在同一區域之內、對於同一社會而行使之、前者之將呑併後者、或破壞後者、爲必然之勢、公共租界工部局、倘欲切實管轄界內華民、並向其徵收捐稅、則於中國官廳、對於租界內華民之權、不得不堅持限制、工部局似早已承認、此爲生死存亡問題、不獨關於界內華民之福利、以及租界之興盛、且與租界治制之全部、亦有存亡之關係、</p>

<p>庶華之父字瓊笙。甲午舉人。癸卯大挑用知縣。發雲南。乙巳署霑益知州。一月理積獄訟逾百。政聲流聞。歲計考曲靖人縣最。丁未署彌勒知縣。二十八寨有積盜。三年易八令。不能治。瓊笙至。則告戍將曰。請兵捕討。寇得爲備。今出不意。往可破擒也。我先行。汝繼之。戎服佩刀。夜襲擒况國至。遂次第擒斬雷珍張朝安等。縣盜悉淸。隷受民錢二百。杖而令返其錢。胥吏千人。逡巡自引去。戊申大潦。蠲租振恤。留任五年。以循政奏獎。補江川令。辛亥擢大關廳同知。并叙勞以知府用。九月雲南舉義。滇督出走。瓊笙先三請疾。不許。乃以修墓告歸。旣得代矣。聞變遣家先行。作書寄庶華曰。九月初十交卸。聞滇垣先夕失守。世方伯被殺。餘無殉節者。臣子之義。萬古維昭。余雖無守土之責。乃實官也。俟北信。當死以明志。汝不必來等語。發書後。十三日僞言京師破。即戒從者治裝。期明日行。質明。汲者見井上雙履。告後令索之。瓊笙在井已瞑。年五十耳。案上得遺書三封。背書自縊不死。又復投井。書中略言京師淪陷。用以身殉云云。於是後令楊宗熙棺殮之。斯時庶華以附生入京師譯學館肆業。民元六月。始奉喪還攸。彌勒士民。請封東井。題曰胡公井。湘人旅滇者。爲文表之。而請王湘綺爲撰井銘泐石。用志不忘云。</p>
<h3>記南滙縣之王媼</h3>
<p>— 顧志周</p>
<p>技擊之術。爲我國人所特長。旣有裨於身體。又可藉以禦敵。自歐西槍砲發明以來。士大夫咸目之爲無足重輕。於是技擊之術遂衰。而一二田夫婦女。反硜硜然守之弗失。余友陳君驚座。南匯籍。謂其鄰有王媼者。精技擊。現年八十。尙能操作耐勞。精神健旺。陳君幼時。嘗親見其著釘鞋在七石巨缸口上行數十週。疾若飛鳥。輕若柳絮。媼故貧。又早寡。糊冥錠以衣食。會有某庵中來一遊方僧。多力凶暴。人憚之。弗敢抗。僧益縱。一日赴媼所。欲買冥錠。强廉其値。媼不允。僧見旁有脚踏紡紗車。重數十斤。即一手提之起。擲媼前。欲壓癟其冥錠以威之也。媼俟其未下。起兩指接而置諸地。僧怒甚。毀其窗戶。轉身出外。媼乃謂之曰。汝爲僧人。不守淸規。强暴甚於匪盜。今故來尋釁。莫謂老婦無法以制汝。言已。一躍而起。離地丈餘。越僧頂。兩足踏其肩。僧頓踣。目直視。口不能言。身不能動。鄰里及行道者麕集。詢得其情。咸曰懲之固當。若置汝死地。恐亦不利。媼以爲然。遂起右足踏僧臀部。曰。去。僧頓醒。鼠竄逃逸。翌日。好事者往庵探之。已不知何往矣。媼父某。亦以技擊名。當太平天國軍隊到南匯時。媼父與之戰。輒勝。一鄕賴以安。至今父老猶有能道其遺事一二者。惟其名陳君已不能記。而媼之精於技擊。蓋得之於家學云。</p>

<h3>記某巨室之古玩珍物</h3>
<p>— 劉豁公</p>
<p>南成都路重慶里。有巨厦焉。自外觀之。亦尋常之樓屋耳。一入其中。即覺輝煌高敞。無異皇宮。前淸某巨公實庽於斯。公與乃祖若父皆顯宦。得御賜大內珍品綦多。益以累世收藏。遂覺隋珠和壁。浩如烟海。美不勝收。頃厭海上塵囂。率眷歸去。珍物旣夥。未便遠携。爰託三發洋行爲之拍賣。余聞而惜之。特於百忙中撥冗往觀。茲就所見。擇要記之。以告世之留心名貴古玩珍物者。</p>
<p>首入余眼簾者。爲一高六尺許之北魏石碑。前勒佛像。後鐫碑文。古色古香。令人神往。媵以唐代之鐵石造像。明代石獅及金漆獅。元代之鐵虎及馬。淸康熙朝之琉璃紅花缸。乾隆朝之粉彩金魚缸。製皆精絕。照眼生纈。以上珍物。皆陳列於大院中。比入廳事。則見紫檀嵌楠木雲石之中堂。掛屏。地屏。紅木嵌寶玉之圍屏。雞絲木之八仙桌及琴檯。紫檀蔭木之太師椅。天然几。供桌。和合桌。更有珊瑚樹二。一紅一白。並高至二尺許。希世珍也。而黃石谷陸廉夫惲氷等之畫。王陽明翁覃溪翁松禪錢南園等之字。並皆眞迹。亦殊不可多得。他若宮用紫檀走線之鐘。漢玉之玦。白玉如意。千年黃楊根之筆筒。犀牛之角。名人彫刻之象牙八仙。圓檯屏。南京織錦之檯毯。淸宮紅緞金繡之桌圍。亦外間鮮見之物也。</p>
<p>另室列乾隆朝絲織之地毯。太和殿御用之金線檯毯。宮用名人彫刻象牙板全本三國志人物。二十四孝圖。百子圖之大圍屏及掛屏。紫檀嵌蔭木之太師椅。寫字檯。白玉之通天鑪。大翡翠船。爵杯。水盂。水晶之觀音像。及鴛鴦。走獸。瑪瑙之象與鳥。盆碗綠雲之瓶金珀之香爐。花瓶康窰黑地五彩之佛像。素三色瓶。靑花瓶。乾隆朝之粉彩花盆。磁缸。碗。掛盆。建窰之觀音。獅。岩窰之花瓶。均窰之香爐。定窰之碗。三代之古銅鼎。鏡。花瓶。錨金佛。古墨。彫刻象牙小件。祥南玩件等。五花八門。多不勝數。至各寢室之陳設。則有中西式之分。中式者悉屬蔭木紅木或紫檀。西式則皆爲法國式極品之來路傢具。形形色色。精妙絕倫。余殊無術以舉其名。惟覺該宅數世之收藏。一旦付諸拍賣。滋可惜耳。側聞此項珍物。今日任人參觀。至二十七日即將當衆拍賣云。</p>
<h3>人體內部之攝影</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>攝取人體內部之影象。我人但知可用愛克司光。然據海外傳來消息。則最近各新式醫院。多另備新奇之法。手續簡單。即將攝影機呑入病人之腹內。</p>
<p>以攝影機入病人之腹。此語殆非一般人所能深信。實則所謂攝影之機。其體積祇如一極細之藥丸。每次經病人呑嚥。率可自數枚以至一打也。</p>
<p>我姑假定斯類醫治上所呑用之攝影機其新名爲攝影丸。丸之發明者。爲奧地利亞靑年科學家二人。不久曾携至英倫。試騐極佳。機作管式。兩端各具如針之小孔。與攝影之片。交相對峙。管內另用小機括。於每秒之一百二十分之一時間內。發爲强光。俾得片上攝留影象。</p>
<p>病人旣呑嚥若干攝影丸後。須立即移住含有磁氣之塲中。藉免身體上感覺不適。並藉磁氣的作用。能使腹內之丸。於轉瞬間各自開攝。迨目的旣達。丸亦逐漸由腹內排洩而出。然後將細微之影片。作充分之放大。則臟腑之間。隱微畢露。病之癥結。自可按圖索驥。此法殊極奇異。或者目爲理想之談。但西方雜誌上言之鑿鑿。要非無據之傳聞也。因譯述藉供本談補白。</p>
<h3>洹上先生黨國淵源記諗</h3>
<p>— 俞逸</p>
<p>先師洹上先生。以書法詩文鳴天下。然世人但目之爲名士。甚者以項城故。不免爲先師詬病。不知先師少蓄大志。慨然有攬轡澄淸之思。尤與黨國發生關係至早。洪憲之議。項城誤於左右。先師獨極口苦諫。此多爲外人所未及諗。今師已矣。長才未展。寸心莫白。不有稱述。何以發幽光而彰潛德。逸無似。竊就平日所知犖犖大者。敬謹錄記。隘於聞見。殊媿崖略。手顫心痛。筆不成字。眼枯淚竭。言不成文。西哲亞理士多德曰。吾愛師。吾尤愛眞理。區區之私。如是而已。唯當世君子垂鑒焉。</p>
<p>淸季革命思潮。蓬勃一時。先師之加入同盟會。爲時甚早。時年不過十七歲。項城方罷政歸。一日有竊告之者。私偵之。果獲自日本東京所寄函件會證等等。項城心許之。溫諭先師曰。兒若是。族吾家矣。盡付諸火以滅跡。遣之京師。然師迺心革命。終不少減也。先師民初南游。日與革命志士相結納。與先烈宋漁父先生過從尤頻。沆瀣殊甚。項城聞之。召宋氏往。談竟日。雅愛其才。會將大用。爲趙秉鈞所沮。及宋氏被人狙擊。先師哭失聲。而民黨與項城讐日深。坐是以敗。詎不惜哉。</p>
<p>帝制議起。先師以政體旣定。不宜屢更。徒以擾民。何足服天下人之心。數諫不聽。復爲詩以諷。嫉者譖之項城前。先師逃至滬。詩酒流連。坦然弗以爲意。密探執照片緝之嚴。令格殺勿論。當時未罹法網者。間不容髪。亦云險矣。</p>
<p>十六年春。先師南來過歷下。張宗昌爲之洗塵。執禮甚恭。瀕行厚致餽贈。遣使將意。以反對國民軍文爲請。先師笑謝之曰。吾豈能逆民心而長軍閥勢熖哉。卒置弗爲。越日而翩然南下矣。</p>
<p>國軍底定東南。滬上舉行慰勞前敵將士游藝大會於新舞台。邀先師參加。時方戒除痼嗜。且痔發。顧猶力疾行。串演崑劇小宴驚變兩折。觀衆歡聲雷動。凡此種種。足覘先師同情黨國之熱忱已。</p>
<p>挽袁寒雲盟兄　　瘦鵑</p>
<p>十年來傾蓋相交。愛我深情如手足。</p>
<p>千里外招魂何處。哭君無淚裂肝腸。</p>
<h3>印度遊記（三三）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>畢缽羅樹者。Peepul　tree在印度或稱菩提樹。云昔佛在此靜坐六年而成道之樹也。此樹印度到處有之。枝葉厚密。遮日蔽熱。助人靜慮。英偉人克雷兆亦坐此樹下。靜思統治印度之術。而致成功者也。昔時商埠未發達。小村市中此樹尤多。克雷兆常據椅吸烟於此樹下。但其故跡今均不可見。改成市塲也。彼善應接。巧於交際。常在各商社應接室游戲塲中與人接洽。</p>
<p>英人之初至此也。印人信神。英人亦贊助之。表示同情。以時致敬於神焉。印度之神最有名者曰加爾。乃女神也。印度人呼廟曰吉打。初時蓋在印村中女神廟而經營一切事業。女神廟合成一名。即曰加爾吉打。此加爾之女神。即前次所述佳利降魔者也。蓋加爾吉打名市。最初乃一女神廟之名。轉變而出。亦便於記憶者矣。</p>
<p>機會爲萬事之母。印度發生內亂。各派互爭。商會籌欵自衛。練士人印度兵平印度之亂。於一六八六年克雷兆初施其商戰而兼兵戰之指揮。結果失敗。不能占加爾吉打。退守西南部印度地方。在今之名埠馬特拉斯省。Madras然繼續奮鬥。爲成功要訣。四年以後。克雷兆氏竟於Nemtolla地方建設英政府。將在一六九0年。該處亦爲一廟地之名。爲光照神廟。此爲後來統治全印之根據也。所可惜者。天不留人。克雷兆氏創建英政府於印度後三年。竟被上帝召去矣。死後葬於約翰教堂側。</p>
<p>偉人克雷兆與印女戀愛。抑婚姻之事。極爲一般人所研究。尙未能甚明白。因印度有一種怪俗。丈夫死。女人不但守寡。且有焚死寡婦於夫墓上之俗。將行此種儀式時。寡婦或自己拾薪。或有子女者助其拾薪。以焚其母。而一般人士皆贊歎之。有功德。不但不禁止而已。克雷兆當時曾救一焚且死之寡婦。此寡婦甚美貌。感其恩。二人遂爲夫婦。生二女。其子婿爲有名人物。爲克氏建一大墓。但克妻生女以後若干年死去。克氏甚思念之。竟不再娶。且殺雞以祭於其墓。此殺牲以祭之事。印度教大禁。但克氏不顧也。不過此故事雖甚明白。而有人懷疑。謂當彼時代英人初到印度。勢力弱。克氏未必敢如此云。</p>

<h3>糧食　米市北昻南穩</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日到船祗十餘號、而錫帮米廠輪運之袋米因輪船公司增價停擯、兼內地裝滬之北粳大都尙須虧耗、故賣戶均不肯賤售、而來源亦日見稀寥、粳市晨開因天陰而提升角外、午間稍平、終則大雨而仍昻一角左右、薄稻銷路不甚暢達、惟高貨頗俏、故價微堅、特開十一元三四角、羊秈高貨活動、中次平平、行情高挺次定、杜子秈埠秈去化不一、賣氣較爽、且頂貨殊枯、是以大盤呈穩立之局、白元乏高市平、陰化貨稀奇暢、價格步升角外、</p>
<p>滬南　昨日河到祗十號左右、市銷各有不同、常蘇白粳如特別頂貨節節帶緊、而普通以下一律穩堅、無甚升降、南帮薄早稻去化祗零胃略進、初本極形平淡、午後因雨轉秀、結果定中帶堅之象、羊杜各秈本街購意不爽、大盤統呈穩定、變元陰化吊銷等頗爲俏俐、因是高貨續見向榮一兩角、中次亦好近角之譜、</p>
<h3>標粉初疲繼挺</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初疲繼佳之象、因洋麥報價、又小一二角左右不等、致一部份人心、均趨觀望、旋以津帮略有胃口、現貨又有抽裝、廠家之籌罷、陸續抽回、故市氣已因此轉定、迨至下午幾盤、則以天雨又驟、陰寒亦甚、內地帮之買氣、亦復見湧、致遠期之漲度、比較見强、但以大勢言、終無過好之希望也、結果本月份較前日好五厘、五月份好一分二厘半、六七月份好一分七厘半、八月份好一分二厘半、九月份好一分云、</p>
<h3>期麥近萎遠秀</h3>

<h3>南北貨　蘭花子大漲小回</h3>
<p>蘭花子近日略有運到、市上存底亦不多、惟以價高銷胃見减、大都均屬零星交易、近日號盤已見回鬆、較高價時有兩許上落、行盤高貨仍難小、惟次色貨受主甚少、價較廉宜云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　皖贛茶訊第一聲</h3>
<p>淸明節過、立夏即來、向稱出口大宗之皖贛新茶、又屆上市時期矣、此後關於各產茶區之重要消息、頗爲一般中外茶商所欲聞、茲亟探得、分別述之如下、</p>

<p>藝術界</p>
<h3>關於晨光藝術會第五屆展覽會</h3>
<p>— 曾希</p>
<p>在民族主義文藝的整個運動裏、繪畫也是其重要的一部門、這次晨光藝術會舉行第五屆展覽會、便在站在民族主義的場合底先鋒底的呈獻、在全部的出品中、有着差不多半數底作品是特顯着尖端底民族主義色彩的、民族主義繪畫、自有其明顯的運動、此次還是一個起始、在理論方面、朱應鵬氏曾有「中國繪畫與民族主義」一文發表在「前鋒月刋」外、還沒有其他有統系底文章出現、然而在朱氏那篇文章上也已供給了相當理論的基礎、而這次乃有這晨光藝術會的民族主義場合的畫展出現、無論那些作品是否已經成熟、然而在運動的歷程上、這初步底先鋒底的工作、已該是引人注目的了、</p>
<p>在下面願將一些重要的出品、—有民族主義之尖端底色彩的、—加以槪略的介紹、想並非全然無意義吧、</p>
<p>（一）神話傳說作題材的</p>
<p>神話在民族主義的繪畫上是一種很好的題材、在西洋將神話傳說表現在藝術品上的、是常見的事、如「愛普廬」「委娜絲」「拉奧孔」之在彫刻、「浮士德」「失樂園」等之在文藝都是最普遍的例、在我國的許多古代的神話與傳說中、是儘有不少可以用做民族主義繪畫的題材的、因爲神話與傳說、最能表白一個民族的靈魂、而尤其是那些原始的神話與古代傳說、那簡直完全是表現了一個民族與長成與其鬥爭的歷史、而且也是最眞切深刻地可以表露一個民族的性格與精神、與其生活進化的過程、而我國的許多神話中尤其因其具有偉大、熱情、勇猛、的精神而最實合於來做民族主義繪畫的題材、如此次畫展之出品中的下列譜題便是、</p>
<p>（甲）「日車」（乙）「后羿射日」（丙）「女媧氏」（丁）「涿鹿之野」（戊）「牛女」等、</p>
<p>「日車」的故事就等於希臘神話中的愛普廬一樣、就是太陽之神、太陽之神的神話、差不多全世界的各民族中都是有的、這是一種原始的神話、原始人對於大自然的神化的想像、而在這上面、是正可以相會到各民族的原革思想之不同、譬如我們看菜尼的晨曦之神、他是在畫面表現出晨曦元神在和一位夜的女神之追逐、而小天使在空揚着火把、一羣美麗的女神圍繞晨曦之神之身旁而舞蹈、夜之女神在前面逃避、於是、大地從甜蜜的夜之睡眠裏報曉了、這是怎樣美麗動人的一段神話呢—、而太陽期於在我國却是一種單純而雄偉的意味的、太陽之神驅其日車、把黑夜逐散了、於是大地漸漸由曙色中伸展、這出典於廠朝李尤作九曲歌上、—「安得力士翻日車」—的一句、雖然他說得太簡單、但我們不難橫想其意思、那正是一段有偉大精神的神話、</p>
<p>關於女媧氏的神話有好幾種說法、如「淮南子」上、「史記」上「列子湯問」上都有、這裏的構圖、乃根據「淮南子」上的「…女媧氏鍊五色石以補開天、…殺黑龍以濟冀州…」兩句、這種神話的描寫的確是很偉大把一個女性描寫得如此奇偉、雖然那是神性的人化、却也可以使我們想像到我們原始人民的勇猛的氣魄了</p>
<p>將這種題材來繪畫、在意義固是非常的好了、然而在構圖與表現上却非常的難啊、</p>
<p>「涿鹿之野」確也是很動人的一幅、只可惜幅面仍就欠大、如果能再大起來、我想作者一定更能在構圖與表現上獲得更好的成功、</p>
<p>關於這幅畫的這種神話、是描寫民族的原始時代的鬥爭史的、像這樣的光榮的史蹟、而它又是一種神話底的、那供用繪畫來創作出來、這是怎樣地尖端底民族主義底的呢、關於它—黃帝征蚩尤—的故事、差不多在小學校的教本上就可以讀到的了、這幅畫的根據許是從史記上的紀述來的、如果能根據「山海經」所說、而又將幅面更擴大、那眞更美麗一幅神話製作了、</p>
<p>現在我所要指出的、那就是以民間最流行的一種神話做題材的「牽牛織女」的一幅了、</p>
<p>牽牛與織女的故事眞是我國的神話中最美麗的一種了、古籍上寫着的也很有多種、在此僅將「古詩十九首」裏的錄下一看吧、</p>
<p>「迢迢牛牽星、皎皎河漢女、纖纖擢素手、機機弄機杼、終日不成章、泣涕零如雨、河漢淸且淺、相去復幾許、盈盈一水間、脉脉不得語、………」</p>
<p>用這個題材來繪畫Composition上也是很難弄得好的、但是、作者却很巧妙地構成了一幅很適當的畫面了、並且作者把牽牛與織女、表現成兩個典型的美男性與美女性、這是充分地站在民族主義的意識裏來創作的、民族主義的繪畫、是要促成一民族的勇敢上向熱情與健康諸好德行的、所以以這熱情的牽牛的題材、而又把肉體表現出健康美來、</p>
<p>（二）以體育生活做題材的、</p>
<p>一個民族的興盛健全、不能不賴其人民的有健全康强的體格、故民族主義繪畫上用體育生活來做題材、那是必然的了、</p>
<p>從許多西洋的古代彫刻上、可以找到那些强健活潑的肉體的典型、如「愛普盧」、如「擲鐵餅的男子」……等、由此、我們能堅信西洋人對於體育的注重、古代希臘的那些神像彫刻給於民族體格的遺傳影響是很大的、</p>
<p>在這裏、晨光藝展中、體育生活來做主要的畫題、我們應怎樣地承認其價値呢、</p>
<p>「終點」是畫着幾個女運動員、因徑賽達於終點時的一剎那的美妙的姿態、但作者却是用極懇的態度去制作的一幅極嚴整的作品、而且在色彩的光明熱烈鮮麗與筆觸的活潑、以及描寫的幾個女運動員的肉體的標準美上看、這是極有意義的、</p>
<p>用色最明潑、用筆最爽快的一幅「飛」、那是描寫着三個泅水者從高處下躍下而在半空中的姿勢、雖然在構圖上色彩</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>上筆觸上、都是很單純地然而它却正給了觀者於個活潑底感覺、以它單純底的色調、給予人明快的印象、</p>
<p>足球塲之一角在色光的表現上是有給人以非常之可親的誘力底、而所畫出的幾個在球塲上蹴的健兒的健康底美的體格與活潑動底姿態、而再加以日光的描寫之成功、與構圖的適當、這幅畫是予吾人以滿足的了、</p>
<p>在這裏還有好幾幅的高躍姿態的描寫、都是同前幅一樣地受到了好效果的、在構圖、色彩、筆觸的諸方面、</p>
<p>（三）以民衆生活與革命事蹟作題材的</p>
<p>以民衆生活來做題材的、這是更可以表見民族的特殊色彩的、譬如西班牙畫家之畫鬥牛、英吉利畫家之畫佃獵生活等、然以民族主義的場合上說、對於民衆生活的描寫、不僅客觀地表見特殊色彩、而且須指示民衆生活之改善、救社會的病態爲其重要的意義、在這次的畫展中的「流離」「災民」…等的幾幅便是這樣了、「流離」與「災民」都是描寫民衆生活之悲慘的一面的、新興的繪畫走到民衆的中心去去表現民衆而且爲民衆訴苦難的、</p>
<p>革命生活的描寫、也就是民族奮鬥史的描寫、而且、「革命」之能給影響與文藝、也是事實上所必然底的了、法蘭西大革命時代陀拉克羅亞的「一八三○年」便是好例、然而在中國、過去的不說、只從興中會起至現在國民革命、這二十年來、固然在文藝上也激起相當的影響、然而在繪畫上、差不多就沒有一張是表現革命生活的描寫、這實是一種缺憾、</p>
<p>「會師鄭州」的一幅、那是描寫北伐時、國民革命軍克復了鄭州地方、而後在露天之下開軍事會議的情形的、這差不多是一種革命過程的紀念畫、觀了這畫而後、是應該在心裏浮起怎樣有趣的回憶啊、</p>
<p>同這幅意義相同的一幅、那便是「眺望」了、長官與士兵們休息在土丘上、而用望過鏡眺望殘敵的踪跡、這種革命時代的軍事生活的表現、</p>
<p>在描寫革命時代的民衆生活的有「工人會議」與「喚起」兩幅可以代表、由這兩幅、我們可以回味革命緊張時代的民衆的狂熱的情緒、「喚起」一幅描寫一個人立在街旁羣衆之高處講演的姿態、構圖與筆調與色彩、能夠運用得非常緊張、這是能夠抓住人情緒的作品、「工人會議」則純爲羣衆運動的描寫了、幾個素朴的工人在開會議、這完全是革命的新印象啊、</p>
<p>此外有「羣衆大會」「女宣傳員」等數幅、可說是革命高潮的紀念作、在此不贅及了、</p>
<p>（四）以民族的恥辱與苦難爲題材的</p>
<p>「在繪畫了表現民族的恥辱與苦難、是促進民族意識覺醒底最有效的方法、已往的共嘗的磨折、先世所受的苦尼、和民族的犧牲、回憶起來、藉着繪畫、詩歌、傳說的力量做媒介、深深地滲入民族的靈魂裏、喚起「共患難同生死」的情緒、比之其表他的表現尤有深刻的影響、民族主義的繪畫者對於這種民族的所受異族的壓迫與恥辱、是認我們應該首先努力的目標│見「前鋒月刋」第二期「中國繪畫與民族主義」文、</p>
<p>在這次畫展中的「長沙印象」、「赤色的恐怖」、「跑馬廳」等幅之作是實踐如上文所說的要求的了、</p>
<p>上面所舉出的、是對這次展覽會中重要作品之槪略底介紹、致於評價的工作、急請觀者去做了、統觀這次全部的作品、在技巧方面、我們能承認其並未失敗、而在題材與內容上、都是打破我國過去的所有沒有立場底展覽會的紀錄了、然而我在此有兩個企望二、一、就是望努力民族主義給畫運動者、能夠更加力地去去努力、並且能創造適合於表現民族主義意義的給畫之新的技巧、二、就是望我們的觀者們能在觀了這次畫展後、對民族主義文藝運動又得以更深切的認識、</p>

<h3>Sino-British and French Legal Rights Negotiations</h3>
<p>A Resolution Has Been Found</p>
<p>British Envoy Quietly Awaits Instructions from London</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In the Sino-British and French negotiations regarding legal rights, a suitable resolution has been found for the points of contention between the two sides. British Envoy Lampson has expressed considerable understanding of our intentions. He is now awaiting instructions from London to arrive in Beijing, after which final discussions can take place. Regarding the Brazilian legal rights issue, further consultations will be held with the Brazilian Envoy Wiloso upon his arrival in Beijing, and then the signing will take place. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is working diligently on the issue of legal rights, but remains unusually silent on the surface. The Dutch envoy left for Beiping on the evening of the 25th. The exchange of documents after the Sino-Norwegian signing was completed on the 23rd. The British envoy continues to hold earnest talks with Foreign Minister Wang daily. At present, attention is focused on Britain, while the situation regarding France is difficult to predict. The place for signing after the Sino-American resolution is undecided. Foreign Minister Wang hosted a dinner for the British and American envoys on the 25th. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Various Countries Request to Retain</h3>
<p>Consular Jurisdiction Within Concessions</p>
<p>Additional Courts to Try Cases Involving Foreign Nationals</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to sources, Britain, the United States, France, and other countries originally requested that consular jurisdiction within the concessions be treated as an exception. After repeated contentions by our side, these countries proposed instead that the Shanghai International Settlement be retained, and that special courts be established in the Shanghai concessions, hiring foreign legal experts as advisors. If both the plaintiff and defendant are foreigners, foreign law should be applied at the court's discretion. Our side objected, stating that while special courts could be established, Chinese law must be applied when trying cases involving foreign nationals. These countries have now agreed to concede. Furthermore, Wang Chonghui went to Shanghai on the evening of the 24th to discuss the matter of establishing additional courts in the Shanghai concessions, and it is reported that he held talks with the legal community in Shanghai. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sino-French Consultation</h3>
<p>Restructuring the Shanghai Mixed Court</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly urged the French envoy to consult on the restructuring of the Shanghai Mixed Court. Since arriving here, French Envoy Wilden has repeatedly consulted with Foreign Minister Wang. The French government has now agreed, and the French Embassy and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have each sent representatives to negotiate. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also requested the Judicial Yuan to send a representative, and a date for joint consultation will be set. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Jiang Zuobin Discusses</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia's Five-Year Plan</p>
<p>Eight-Character Commentary</p>
<p>"Thrift and Hardship to Build and Found the Nation"</p>
<p>(Harbin) This afternoon, a reporter interviewed Jiang Zuobin at the Grand Hotel. According to his account, he was ordered by the Central Government to investigate the Soviet Union's Five-Year Economic Plan. Last month, he arrived in Moscow and first received a thorough explanation from the Supreme Council of the Five-Year Economic Plan. Afterwards, he was assigned guides to observe the Moscow, Caucasus, and Ukraine regions. The Russian New Economic Plan is being implemented in five regions across the country, and the development is truly astonishing. The situation can be summarized in an eight-character commentary: "Thrift and hardship to build and found the nation." The entire nation, from top to bottom, is working practically. For example, in the Caucasus, oranges are produced and sold domestically for three yuan and five jiao apiece, but exported for only one jiao and five fen. The people in the country are scrimping and saving to promote products and exchange them for cash. The purpose of the promotion is the United States and Germany. Many factories are being built. The reason for this is also environmental compulsion. Because Soviet Russia's policies are seen as a thorn in the side by the world, it must either compromise with others or raise its own status. Therefore, the whole country is working hard together. Now all the merchants in the country have been overthrown and transformed into workers, but even that is not enough. Our country's situation is similar to Russia's. We must also work hard to avoid being hoped upon by foreigners. (24th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary's Diplomatic Talk</h3>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Henderson stated that pre-European War diplomacy was driven by egoism, while post-European War diplomacy is driven by reconciliation and cooperation. We are currently in a transitional stage between the two ideologies. He also stated that arbitration and disarmament are extremely important matters today, and that arbitration alone cannot ensure lasting peace.</p>
<p>It is difficult to prevent a country's diplomacy from being driven by egoism, as every citizen loves their country. If it is not for the benefit of the country, it will be opposed by the citizens. Therefore, to prevent diplomacy from being solely driven by egoism, it is first necessary to ensure that the majority of citizens understand the overall situation of the world, so that they are not limited by temporary or local egoism, which may ultimately harm the country. The result of the European War is an example of this. Secondly, it is necessary to ensure that citizens are not attached to illegitimate rights inherited from the past, believing that they are entitled to them and refusing to relinquish them. In other words, the benefit that one is not entitled to is the harm that another is not entitled to suffer. From a deeper perspective, relinquishing benefits that one is not entitled to may actually be beneficial. Whether a right is legitimate should be judged based on the principles of the matter, not based on prolonged occupation or aggression. One should not claim ownership simply because one has occupied something for a long time or acquired it through aggression. Relinquishing something should not be considered detrimental to one's own interests.</p>

<h3>Roman Curia Recognizes</h3>
<p>The New Spanish Government</p>
<p>General Berenguer Declares Support for the Republic</p>
<p>British Emperor Receives the Deposed King Alfonso</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 25th - The Roman Curia has recognized the new Spanish government. Former Prime Minister General Berenguer has signed a declaration stating his support for the Republic. Former Police Chief General Morales is accused of acting rashly and behaving frivolously, and an arrest warrant has been issued.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - British Emperor George received Spanish King Alfonso at Windsor Palace today.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - Alfonso's third son, Don Juan, arrived in London last night and will enter Dartmouth Naval College.</p>
<p>National News, Madrid, 25th - Former Spanish Prime Minister Berenguer, his brother, the former Madrid Military Governor Frederico, Police Commissioner Moller, and many other dynasty officials signed an oath of allegiance to the Republic today. This oath, drafted by the provisional government, declared that the signatories would be loyal to the Republic and willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the Republic. It was promulgated last night. Military officers who refused to sign the oath were dismissed. Junior officers also had to sign the same oath. Soldiers had to swear allegiance to the Republic. As for foreign affairs, almost all countries have now recognized the provisional government, and even the Curia has formally recognized it. Newspapers mostly hope that this move can eliminate the reaction of the clergy.</p>
<h3>Unrest in Portuguese Territory Unsubdued</h3>
<p>Large Demonstrations by the People of Volporto</p>
<p>Portuguese Government Convenes Reserve Troops</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lisbon, 24th - Today, a large group of constitutionalists suddenly appeared in the streets of Volporto and held a large demonstration. The police were unable to disperse them and sought assistance from the military, who then opened fire on the crowd several times, killing several people instantly and wounding countless others. The public was in a state of panic. The people's resentment towards the dictatorship has deepened as a result. In recent days, the revolutionary comrades of Portugal, seeing the success of the revolution in neighboring countries, have become even more determined. Therefore, although news of the government army's repeated victories over the revolutionary army on the rebel islands has been reported, the revolutionary ideas have penetrated deeply, like accumulated firewood containing fire, which will ignite with a single spark. The unrest in Santo Port is actually the first revolutionary battle in Portugal. The government is deeply aware of the dangerous situation, so it has ordered the immediate assembly of two types of reserve troops nationwide. All officers on leave must also return to their camps immediately. Rumors have been spreading in recent days that revolutionary parties have shipped as many as 30,000 firearms from England, which have now been secretly smuggled into the country and distributed to the people for the purpose of uprising. As for the current situation on the rebel islands, it is reported that government troops have landed on the small island of Santo, which is about 50 nautical miles from Madeira Island. Because it is difficult to land on the front of Madeira Island, it is planned to use Santo Island as a base for future progress. However, according to newspaper reports, these war expenses now average about £10,000 per day.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>Consultation on Negotiations with China</p>
<p>Future Policy Will Undergo Some Changes</p>
<p>Also Expressing Opinions on Extraterritoriality Issues</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 25th - The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs consulted last night on Japan's negotiating policy towards China. Deputy Envoy Shigemitsu was also present. Because Deputy Envoy Shigemitsu reported on various matters related to Sino-Japanese negotiations and the current status of negotiations between China and other countries, it is now largely understood. Today, further consultations will be held to decide on the negotiating policy and specific countermeasures. As a result, Japan's negotiating policy may undergo some changes. It is expected that there will be further progress on extraterritoriality and other issues. Therefore, the trend of negotiations after Deputy Envoy Shigemitsu returns to his post is extremely noteworthy.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 25th - After receiving a report on the establishment of an agreement between China and the Netherlands to abolish consular jurisdiction, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its opinion, saying that although the Netherlands has abolished extraterritoriality, other countries may not follow suit immediately. To date, five or six countries have abolished extraterritoriality, and the Netherlands is the newest addition. In view of the current situation in emerging China, extraterritoriality will inevitably be abolished sooner or later, but it must be done through a considerable sequence.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th - The recall of Japanese Deputy Envoy to China, Shigemitsu Aoi, is to understand the political world's emotional atmosphere towards China and to receive new instructions, which is secondary. Because this kind of emotion cannot be conveyed by official documents. After Shigemitsu Aoi meets with key personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he can return to China at the end of this month, as he wants to arrive in Nanjing by the opening of the National Congress on May 5.</p>
<h3>British Merchants Plan</h3>
<p>Methods to Stabilize the Price of Silver</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - The London British Chamber of Commerce, in view of the low price of silver and its serious impact on trade in the East, passed a resolution today requesting the government to make efforts to convene an international conference to find methods to stabilize the price of silver. The Chamber also discussed the Soviet Russian Five-Year Plan and criticized its new sales methods, as these new methods will seriously undermine the global commercial system. The meeting also passed a resolution instructing the Chamber's Executive Committee to study the impact of Russian-made goods on trade in the United Kingdom, the sales methods of Russian goods, and the annual development of the Russian Five-Year Plan, as the production of Russian goods is increasing accordingly, and their prices are not determined by the true cost of production. Sir Allen said that although he did not believe in the success of the Russian plan, the speed of its production increase was alarming, and other countries' industries and businesses currently experiencing economic panic would be greatly affected.</p>

<h3>Results of the Turkish Election</h3>
<p>Complete Victory for the Nationalist Party</p>
<p>National News Agency, Ankara, 25th - The results of yesterday's Turkish election show that the ruling Nationalist Party won a complete victory. The number of seats obtained exceeded expectations. Although 30 seats were reserved for the opposition, only 20 of its candidates were elected, as Istanbul and smaller towns refused to vote for the opposition party.</p>
<p>Reuters, Constantinople, 25th - Turkish President Kemal advocated creating an independent political party in the parliament to limit the dictatorship of the People's Party (i.e., the President's Party) to seven years. However, according to the preliminary results of yesterday's Turkish legislative elections, it seems that what President Kemal advocated was not realized. The President ordered the Election Commission to elect 30 independent members of parliament freely, in addition to the 287 People's Party candidates he designated. However, the Election Commission, entirely composed of members of the People's Party, was unable to do so. The election results in Istanbul and Samson both proved that voters did not cast a single vote for the candidates representing the new party. Similar results are expected in other regions.</p>
<h3>Results of the Dutch Election</h3>
<p>Great Victory for the Left</p>
<p>National News Agency, Amsterdam, 24th - As a result of the Dutch provincial council elections, the left wing won a great victory. The Socialist Party increased from 120 seats to 130 seats, and the Communist Party increased from 7 seats to 12 seats. On the bourgeois side, the Liberal Party decreased from 62 seats to 58 seats, and the Radical Party decreased from 42 seats to 32 seats. The Farmers' Party almost completely failed, retaining only one of its previous ten seats.</p>
<h3>British Prince Arrives in Lisbon with Brother</h3>
<p>Reuters, Lisbon, 25th - The British Prince of Wales arrived here at 7:30 this morning with his brother Prince George. Tomorrow, they plan to take the British warship Kent to the mouth of the Corrante River, where they will transfer to a car to go to Bordeaux and take a plane back to the country.</p>
<h3>British Railways Prepare for Electrification</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - A committee has submitted a report advocating that all 51,000 miles of railways in Great Britain be converted to electricity within 15 years, at an estimated cost of £386 million. The committee acknowledged that this move is unprecedented in the history of world industry, but it cannot be ignored because of its high cost, and the economic and social value of this move. Moreover, after the conversion to electricity, the national railways can save £12.5 million in expenses annually. This plan is now expected to be supported by various railway companies, and several have already made timetables.</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Criticize Feetham Report</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - The Times today criticized the first half of the Feetham Report, saying that the current environment in Shanghai does not allow for open investigation, so the evidence obtained by Feetham is mostly from private conversations or written statements. From this point of view, it seems that Feetham's most important judgments are sometimes based on his own views, but this is not the case. But even if there is, Feetham's personality and experience are sufficient guarantees of the fairness and truthfulness of his judgments. This report may have a significant impact on the history of the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - The Manchester Guardian commented on the Feetham Report today, saying that Shanghai can be congratulated on Feetham's advice on municipal improvements. The first half of the report is clear in meaning and strong in reasoning. It is expected that the second half will be the same.</p>
<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Recovers from Illness and Returns to London</h3>
<p>To Attend the Cabinet Meeting and Read the Budget Speech</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - British Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden, who has been ill for a long time, returned to London by car from his country residence today. To avoid public attention, he entered the Treasury Department by a roundabout route, as crowds were standing by on Downing Street, many carrying cameras, all wanting to see his style.史旋即出席於內閣會議、宣讀其預算演詞、聞其詞極短、大約一小時即可演講完畢、星期一日提出預算案時、將有醫士二人坐於旁聽席以待、反對黨領袖有同情的建議、謂史講至一半、不妨稍息、外相漢德森告新聞記者、史近狀甚好、途中未覺勞頓云、</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Discusses Diplomatic Doctrine</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - British Foreign Secretary Henderson said at a dinner for foreign journalists tonight that pre-war diplomacy was based on egoism, while post-war diplomacy was based on reconciliation and cooperation. We are now in a transitional class between the two types of diplomacy, so arbitration and disarmament are extremely important. Mere arbitration cannot stabilize peace. Unless disarmament is completed, the old spirit of suspicion and doubt will never be eliminated. The success of the Disarmament Conference can reduce the danger of economic decline, which cannot be achieved by any other method. The arms issue, such as the naval dispute between France and Italy, cannot be resolved, which will lead to the revival of the shipbuilding program and eventually destroy the value of the London Naval Treaty.</p>
<h3>International Cotton Industry Conference to be Held Soon</h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 24th - The International Cotton Federation Conference will be held here on June 23. There will be representatives from a total of 22 countries attending the conference.

<h3>New York Customs Officials Seize Morphine</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 24th - Customs officials here seized morphine worth $500,000. It is reported that the drug was found in a package, which was unloaded by a German ship. The package was labeled as cotton goods.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Wakatsuki Unwilling to Give Up Alcohol</h3>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 25th - Hayashi Ryutaro, the president of the Osaka Temperance Society and an old friend of Prime Minister Wakatsuki, sent a letter to the Prime Minister yesterday, advising him to give up alcohol. The letter stated that your addiction to alcohol has been a long time, and it may be difficult to quit once and for all. However, now that you are the Prime Minister of a country, occupying a high position in the court, with great achievements and prestige, if you can call for it and quit immediately, it will benefit the world and people's hearts and the country. Its merit will be above the London Treaty. After receiving this letter, Prime Minister Wakatsuki only said that the words of an old friend were very grateful. Addiction to alcohol is not a good thing, so I never advise people to drink. However, I am addicted to it, and I scratch my head repeatedly, unwilling to explicitly say that I will give up alcohol.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russian Timber Arrives in the United States</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Providence, 24th - The Finnish ship Anforsus arrived here today with 3 million tons of Soviet Russian timber. Because the US Treasury Department prohibits the import of goods produced by prisoners or forced labor, this timber cannot be shipped in the United States unless it is proven that it was not obtained through forced labor. According to the ban issued by the Treasury Department, this is the first time that Soviet Russian timber has been shipped to the United States, so it has attracted much attention from the outside world.</p>

<p>A Madman Strikes the Bell, the Whole City is Shocked</p>
<p>National News Agency, Royal Capital, 24th - The large bell of the Catholic Church in the capital of Romania suddenly rang loudly today, shocking the entire city. Because the bell is not allowed to be rung unless there is a national war or the death of a monarch, the ringing of the bell today caused panic throughout the city. Some said that war had been declared with Red Russia, and some said that King Carol had suddenly collapsed. People gathered at the church doors, waiting quietly for the release of the real news. When the authorities learned of the incident and investigated it, they discovered that a madman had secretly entered the church, climbed the bell tower, and struck the bell for fun. Then the people laughed and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Adds Many Merchant Ships</h3>
<p>Reuters, Riga, 24th - Soviet Russia plans to build many merchant ships to avoid being controlled by foreign shipping. An order has now been issued that anyone with experience in water transportation must be forced to serve at sea.</p>

<h3>National Aviation Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>The National Aviation Conference held its closing ceremony on the afternoon of the 25th. Chairman Chen Yi delivered the closing address, stating that aviation is the sole necessity for modern military transportation. To enhance military power, land, sea, and air forces must develop in equal measure. Without an air force, the effectiveness of the land and sea forces is lost. Air force equipment is more economical compared to land and sea forces, presenting no difficulties and being extremely rapid to establish. However, it relies on the government providing adequate funding to promote its construction and development. It is also necessary to awaken the public to work together to achieve full progress in military, civil, and commercial aviation within the shortest possible time. Next, Director Zhang Hui gave a speech, emphasizing: (1) Aviation administration should be unified to seek comprehensive development; (2) All parties should jointly be responsible for the resolutions of the conference and put them into practice. After the speech, a group photo was taken, and the conference adjourned. Attached below is the closing declaration:</p>
<p>"The Ministry of Military Administration, in view of the astonishing progress in aviation technology and its application in various countries in recent years, and the gradual emergence of domestic military and civil aviation, coinciding with the beginning of national tutelage and the time for vigorous construction, to coordinate the overall national aviation construction plan and strive for the development of aviation, invited representatives from various central ministries, provincial and municipal governments, and aviation agencies, and appointed experts with long-standing reputations, to hold the National Aviation Conference for joint discussion. The conference opened on April 20th and closed on the 26th, lasting seven days. Two hundred and ten proposals were discussed. Everyone worked diligently, upholding the late Premier's legacy of saving the nation through aviation, examining the major trends in global aviation progress, assessing the current state of domestic aviation immaturity, and summarizing the key points of aviation proposals from various aspects. We respectfully declare as follows:</p>
<p>The possibility of human flight was ridiculed as a dream thirty years ago. Later, it gradually progressed from research and invention to experimentation. With the outbreak of the European War, aviation advanced rapidly out of necessity. The resulting death, injury, and destruction were astonishing at the time. As for today, apart from civil aviation, in terms of military use, its effectiveness has increased two to three times compared to wartime. In terms of quantity, it has increased five to ten times. Humans have expanded from planar activities to three-dimensional activities. Dropping a two-ton bomb from the air can turn a carefully managed fortress or giant warship into ruins. Releasing chemical warfare gases or liquids from the air can lead to the decline of dense and prosperous cities and industrial and economic zones. The great powers have long recognized this and are actively developing military and civil aviation in preparation for offense and defense, which is essential for the survival of a nation today. In terms of air force equipment, some countries have over a thousand aircraft, while others have over four thousand. Reconnaissance, bombing, pursuit, and combat aircraft each perform their functions and follow their respective styles. In terms of air defense equipment, the machinery is extremely sophisticated. With the aerial gateway open everywhere, meticulous preparations are made at all times to make it difficult for the enemy to invade. In terms of aviation administration, agencies are established, laws and regulations are clearly defined, and encouragement, assistance, supervision, and management are provided to promote development based on expediency and a clear understanding of theory. In terms of educating talent, courses are divided into specialties, involving thousands of people, yet examinations are extremely strict, ensuring competence. In terms of manufacturing industry, no effort or sacrifice is spared in testing, researching, and striving without reservation. In terms of ground facilities, airfields are widely established and numerous navigation beacons are set up to facilitate navigation. In terms of civil aviation, every effort is made to promote it. Besides transportation, it also includes surveying, sowing, locust control, and sightseeing. In terms of aviation security and safety, the scope of meteorological reporting is expanded, and aviation radio stations and markers are widely established. Currently, the French Air Force has 4,500 aircraft and 40,000 personnel, making it the world's leading air force. In the United States, civil aviation aircraft have increased to 7,000 and airfields to over 5,000 in five years, with a total investment of nearly 700 million yuan. The United Kingdom's aviation budget last year was 20 million pounds. The ability to establish such authority, achieve such results, and make such a determination is no accident.</p>
<p>Our country's aviation industry has been around for twenty years since its initial establishment. In the meantime, due to repeated wars, in terms of military use, whether it is aircraft, personnel, or ground facilities, it has largely waxed and waned, without any significant progress. As of now, in terms of air force equipment, the central government has less than a hundred aircraft in total, both new and old, and has to make do with whatever is available. One type of aircraft is often used for various tasks. In terms of air defense equipment, not only are the provinces and cities neglected, but also the capital and important ports and fortresses. In terms of aviation administration, the agency has not yet been independent, and many laws and regulations have not yet been promulgated. In terms of aviation education, a class was only initially established at the Central Military Academy, with less than a hundred people. Although it is now independent, the direction is yet to be decided, and it will still take time to train personnel. In terms of manufacturing industry, the general industry in the country is depressed, and machines and raw materials cannot be supplied domestically for the time being. The lack of talent makes it even more difficult. In terms of ground facilities, the central government has only about twenty airfields, and most are small. Many of the ancillary buildings are missing. Air routes and beacons have never been considered. In terms of civil aviation, there are only two foreign-funded joint venture postal transport companies, with fewer than twenty aircraft in total. In terms of aviation security, the original meteorological services are not developed, and aviation meteorology has not yet been established. Aviation radio stations and markers have not been considered. In terms of aviation facilities and capabilities, the total monthly aviation expenditure is only over ten thousand yuan, which is less than one percent of the army's expenditure. The state of immaturity is such. However, since the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army to the recent campaigns against Yan Xishan and the Communists, the air force has participated in every battle. Its effectiveness and achievements are obvious to everyone. Especially in the recent battles against Yan Xishan, its power was even greater. This also demonstrates the effectiveness of the air force, even if the scale is extremely small, it can still achieve great results. Moreover, the China National Aviation Corporation has only been established for a short time, and only postal transportation is its income, yet it already generates 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per month. This also demonstrates the great potential of civil aviation. However, compared with the world's great powers, the difference is too great. At the very least, our country should have the ability to defend itself in the air. Therefore, the assembly believes that striving for the development of aviation is the most essential plan today.</p>
<p>What is the way to develop aviation? First, the air force should be expanded as soon as possible. The number of our country's existing air force is less than one-eleventh of others. In terms of quality, it is almost zero. Therefore, the assembly believes that it is urgent to expand and complete it by separating functions and types. Second, air defense facilities should be deployed as soon as possible. The cost of air defense facilities is extremely low compared to protecting seaports and land fortresses. Air routes have no limitations of terrain, and every place is a gateway that can directly reach the heartland. Therefore, the assembly believes that the central government and even all localities must make every effort to plan in advance to avoid digging a well only when thirsty. Third, aviation administration should determine its direction as soon as possible. If the agency and authority of aviation administration are not determined, and if important aviation laws and regulations are not promulgated, then there will be no basis for leadership and encouragement, let alone development. Therefore, the assembly believes that the central government should, based on expediency and in accordance with theory, unify aviation administration at the central level in the near future. Fourth, the cultivation of aviation talent should be carried out actively as soon as possible. The preparation of talent is different from other equipment. It must be nurtured in advance before it can be used. The assembly believes that aviation schools should be actively carried out in a timely manner. In particular, students from all over the country should be recruited to universalize education. Outstanding talents should be selected for further study abroad, and the publicity of aviation books and texts should be promoted and included in the curriculum of primary and secondary schools to instill aviation knowledge and awaken public awareness of aviation. Fifth, the aviation manufacturing industry should be developed as soon as possible. In the past, the Central Shanghai Factory, the Navy, and the Guangdong Aviation Office all had some achievements in aviation manufacturing, but they were ultimately fragmentary and disjointed, costing a lot of effort but achieving little. The assembly believes that at present, the principle of using foreign capital should be followed in accordance with the late Premier's instructions to cooperate with foreign companies to make up for the lack of domestic machinery, raw materials, and talent. At the same time, the organization and equipment for research should be pursued, and the government should be asked to find ways to promote general industry and develop fuel to prepare for complete self-sufficiency in the future. Sixth, the ground facilities for aviation should be universally and completely prepared as soon as possible. Our country has a larger area and population than the United States, but our country has only about twenty airfields, while the United States has hundreds of airports and 5,000 airfields. The night flight equipment and air routes are perfect, making it the best in the world. All of this is the result of the automatic efforts of various localities. The central and state governments have spent very little. Therefore, the assembly believes that the ground facilities in our country should also be jointly developed and automatically raised under the guidance of the central competent authority in various localities to plan airfields and widely lay out signs. Not only will the development of air routes benefit the transportation and culture of various localities, but also, from a passive point of view, it is also a part of air defense facilities, which should not be neglected. Seventh, civil aviation should be promoted as soon as possible. At present, domestic civil aviation only has postal transportation, and there are only three air routes, and most of them involve foreign capital. Other civil aviation services have not yet been established. The assembly hopes that other government agencies and general merchants will immediately find ways to apply aviation in various aspects when domestic aviation manufacturing begins and determine the principle of allowing merchants to handle aviation to develop operations and invest in the use of aviation. Only then can civil aviation be expected to develop substantially. Eighth, the policies for aviation security and safety should be determined as soon as possible. In terms of security, the assembly believes that the treatment of military and civilian aviation personnel should be mutually consulted and properly revised and improved to encourage and stimulate them. Regarding the insurance industry, attention should be paid to cracking down on and subsidizing it to prevent it from hindering the development of aviation. In terms of safety, the assembly believes that meteorological communication services should be increased and expanded separately, and special aviation maps should be made to meet the needs of aviation. The quality of the aircraft, the technology of the personnel, and the adequacy of the ground facilities should all be carefully inspected by the competent authorities and checked at any time. These are all directly related to the prosperity and decline of the entire aviation industry. Ninth, aviation funding should be increased as soon as possible. The central aviation expenditure is only over ten thousand yuan per month, which is used to support thousands of people and maintain and supplement supplies. Aviation consumption is extremely high, and depreciation is the greatest. With this small amount, not only is there no way to develop, but there is also a risk of decline. Therefore, the assembly believes that even if the national treasury is empty and aviation funding cannot be increased to hundreds of millions like the United Kingdom for the time being, it is also possible to slightly reduce the more than one hundred times the army's expenditure to benefit the air force and various equipment for general aviation. This should also be urged that the government resolutely adopt and implement.</p>
<p>All of these points are a brief overview of the aviation construction plan. Among the various proposals at this conference, there are many detailed and profound discussions, which have been carefully studied and resolved and submitted to the government for selection and reference, hoping that they will be gradually implemented in the future and achieve the effect of development in the shortest possible time. At this closing, the assembly deeply feels that the convening of this aviation conference by the Ministry of Military Administration is of great significance, and the result of the conference is also very satisfactory. Therefore, the main points are publicized to party branches at all levels and the people of the whole country, hoping to urge the government and work together to prevent the resolutions of this conference from being empty talk. Aviation is fortunate, and the country is fortunate. We hereby declare."</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in Shandong Surrounded at the Foot of Mount Baodugou</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu ordered the armies surrounding Mount Baodugou on the 20th to conduct a second suppression to prevent the bandits from fleeing south to Zaozhuang. According to military sources today, the front-line military deployment for suppressing the bandits is to strictly block the north and south routes and search and attack the east and west routes. The 22nd Division, led by Gu Liangmin, is responsible for the east route, and the 15th Route, led by Ma Tengjiao, is responsible for the west route, coordinating to advance. The 58th Division, led by Chen Yaohan, is in the southeast, and the 7th Division, led by Wang Jun, is in the southwest, connecting the southern blockade line. The Gu Division has already passed to a line eight or nine li from Mount Baodugou, and the Ma Division has advanced to a line within twenty-four li of Mount Baodugou, defeating more than 2,000 bandits. A portion fled to thirty li east of Teng County, where they were annihilated by the 1st Regiment of the Pistol Brigade stationed in Teng County, led by Jia Benshen. As for the bandits gathered at Juliangou in Linqu, they have already broken the siege and fled south. The commander of the 29th Division, Cao Fulin, came to Jinan from Linqu yesterday to report. Han Fuqu has ordered Cao to return to Linqu today (the 23rd) to lead his troops to block the bandits from Mount Baodugou from breaking the siege and fleeing east. The telegrams of triumph from the staff office stationed in Teng County, Ma Yang, for the past two days are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Ming Dynasty Buddhist Sutras Outside of Hainan Temple</h3>
<p>Both Thousand Buddha Temple and Shi Jia Temple each have one copy.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Wang Xiantang, director of the Shandong Library, recently received an order from the Department of Education to go to Yexian County to investigate the Buddhist scriptures of the Hainan Temple. Currently, the Buddhist scriptures of the Hainan Temple are packed in eight wooden boxes and fifteen sacks and have been transported to Jinan yesterday. The loss of the Hainan Temple's Buddhist scriptures has attracted much attention from all sides. Because the Ming Dynasty's Buddhist scriptures were engraved in the north, they are known as the Northern Scriptures. At that time, major temples prepared their own funds to request printing. Therefore, many temples in the northern provinces have Buddhist scriptures. According to the investigation, the Thousand Buddha Temple in Yexian County still has half a copy of the Buddhist scriptures, mostly Buddhist scriptures. Because the temple has preserved them well, they are completely undamaged. The temple is unwilling to transport them to the province for preservation, so the Department of Education has not forced them. However, the Shi Jia Temple inside the north gate of Jiyang City also has a copy of the Buddhist scriptures (full of three halls), which is the same as the one collected by Hainan Temple (more Buddhist scriptures). Because the preservation is not good, there have also been losses. Upon receiving the news, the Department of Education has ordered the Shandong Library to investigate. The library plans to send personnel there in the next few days and plans to negotiate to transport them back to Jinan so that they can be supplemented with the library's collections and the remains of Hainan Temple to form a complete copy. It is said that the scriptures of Jiyang were read by the great Confucian Zhang Hao'an (Erqi) of the Qing Dynasty, which is especially valuable. Since then, no one has paid attention to them, and they have been piled up in the house, so they are inevitably damaged.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Japanese Selling Illegal Guns Case</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The case of the Japanese Ronin, Lin Jidi, privately selling illegal guns was previously solved by the 48th Division's Gendarmerie Battalion, which submitted the suspect and the evidence to the Provisional Headquarters, which in turn sent it to the Municipal Government for handling. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government consulted with Zhou Zechun, the special commissioner of the Five Provinces Foreign Affairs Inspectorate, to determine the method of negotiation and was about to file a protest. Coincidentally, the Japanese Consul Sakane Junzo visited Zhou and requested to take Lin Jidi back. Zhou believed that this action by the Japanese was enough to disrupt our country's security and that it was not enough to eliminate hidden dangers without serious crackdown. Therefore, he proposed two conditions to the Japanese Consul: (1) He must guarantee that this will not happen again in the future; (2) Expel Lin Jidi from Chinese territory and severely punish him. After several rounds of negotiations between the two sides, they have generally been decided. At 8 p.m. on the 24th, the Japanese Consul officially acknowledged: (1) Not only will he crack down on Lin Jidi's behavior, but he will also assist the Chinese government in preventing similar incidents from happening again in the Japanese Concession or among Japanese Chinese. (2) He will immediately send Lin Jidi back to his country and punish him according to law. Only then did our side take Lin Jidi from the Public Security Bureau and hand him over to the Japanese Consul to take back. The matter was resolved. The Municipal Government has now submitted the course of events to the Provisional Headquarters and requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate. (April 25th)</p>
<h3>Wu Peifu Goes to Beijing from Sichuan</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Wu Peifu has been in Sichuan for four years since his defeat in battle. He usually dispatches himself with calligraphy and painting and has never heard about state affairs. The people of the country have also forgotten him. Recently, the saying that Wu will go to Beijing from Sichuan has been rampant. According to a certain source, Wu has already started east from Sichuan and will pass through Hankou in a few days. Previously, Liu Cunhou, a general in Sichuan, telegraphed He Chengjun, chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, two months ago, roughly saying that Wu Ziyu was staying in Sichuan and had no political activities. He was afraid that someone would use his name to plot for illegality and increase his guilt. He urgently wanted to go to Beijing to meet Chairman Jiang and express his feelings in person. He also said that Wu was only seeking a place to live in order to end his years and had no political hopes whatsoever. After receiving Liu's telegram, Chairman He forwarded it to Chairman Jiang for review because of his sincere words. Later, Liu Cunhou sent a representative to the capital to personally visit Chairman Jiang and reiterate his previous request. Chairman Jiang was magnanimous and immediately agreed. After Wu received the news, he set off from Sichuan and will arrive in Hankou within days. It is said that he will not stay in Hankou and will go directly to Beijing. After that, he may live in West Lake, Zhejiang. (April 24th)</p>
<h3>Another Bandit Bombing Incident in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Li'an Ferry Sinks on the Spot</p>
<p>Two Crew Members Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the beginning of this month, there have been three cases of pirates bombing ships for robbery in Guangdong Province. Unexpectedly, they continue. On the evening of the 19th, another case of pirates bombing the Li'an ferry occurred in Guangzhou, a place full of military police. The Li'an ferry is the property of Henan Nanhua Company, which usually sails between Dongguan Taiping and Guangzhou. It usually departs from Guangzhou for Taiping (adjacent to Humen) at 7 a.m. every morning and returns from Taiping to Guangzhou in the afternoon. The ferry is equipped with military equipment to protect passengers, which has always been effective. Therefore, there have been no robberies in the past. Unexpectedly, it has recently been coveted by pirates. More than ten days ago, the ferry suddenly received a letter from the Shuntian Xingdao Haiqiangtang, established by the bandit gang Luo Jihong, stating that the gang's food was urgent and needed help to maintain it. If they did not agree, they would be treated with drastic measures. After receiving the letter, the ferry business saw the bandit's letter full of threatening words, but did not explicitly state the amount of extortion and the location of the handover. They had to send the original letter to the Shipping Association for submission to the authorities for filing so that they could secretly arrest the bandits. Many days passed, and they thought nothing would happen until yesterday (the 19th) evening, when the ferry was anchored on the South Bank River (in front of the Central Bank) waiting for passengers and loading goods, preparing to depart this morning. Fortunately, there were only a dozen passengers and a small amount of goods sent by the stores last night. At about 10 o'clock, the crew members had gone to bed and were dreaming sweetly when a loud noise suddenly occurred in the stern cabin, and flames shot out, shaking the entire ship. The crew members were awakened in surprise and got up to check. They caught sight of the accountant's clerk sleeping in the cabin being burned. The crew member Chen Dong was lying in a pool of blood in the cabin, knowing that he had been injured by the bombing. At the same time, river water had poured in from the bottom of the cabin, and there was no help for the drowning. They quickly rescued Chen from the fire and carried him ashore. Before long, there was another cry for help from the accounting room. Partner Chen Hong was also injured at the same time and could not move. Fortunately, he was also rescued. After a long period of commotion, the Li'an ferry sank into the water, exposing only the bow. It is estimated that in addition to the two people mentioned above who were injured, the other dozen or so people on board were fortunately unharmed. The two injured have been sent to the hospital for treatment. Chen Dong, 24 years old, from Dongguan, is the accounting clerk. He has a fractured right knee from the explosion. His right buttocks and right arm have injuries, and his face and legs have been burned. His pulse is weak, and his life may be in danger. Chen Hong, 50 years old, from Dongguan, has been injured on his left forehead and left shoulder from the explosion and is bleeding profusely. Today, the ferry owner Tan Zhaolin has reported the situation to the Shipping Association and asked it to forward the report to the authorities to arrest the bandits and bring them to justice.

<h3>The Tragedy of the Guangjiu Train Derailment</h3>
<p>Passengers Totaling One Hundred Fifty to Sixty People</p>
<p>Only Thirty-Odd People Have Been Rescued</p>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: The Guangjiu Railway, the section from Guangzhou to Shenzhen is the Chinese section, and the section from Shenzhen to Kowloon in Hong Kong is the British section. Yesterday, the 20th, at 4:39 PM, Passenger Train No. 19, departing from Shenzhen to Hong Kong, consisted of five carriages. Behind the locomotive was one first-class carriage, followed by one second-class carriage, and the remaining three were third-class carriages. At 5:01 PM, it arrived at Tai Po Station and stopped for one minute. At 5:02 PM, it continued towards Kowloon. Unexpectedly, when it reached Tunnel No. 3 near Sha Tin, it derailed at 5:15 PM. The circumstances of the accident are investigated as follows:</p>
<p>(Accident Location) The accident location belongs to Tai Po in the New Territories, with the sea on the left, known as Ma Liu Shui, and a mountain on the right. Between the mountain and the railway is a ditch called Chek Lan Hang. When the train reaches this point, it must pass through Tunnel No. 3. The railway is built very high between the sea and the mountain ditch, like a dam. In this accident, the locomotive fell into the Chek Lan Hang.</p>
<p>(Cause of Accident) The cause of this accident is attributed to the continuous heavy rain, which washed away the sand and gravel under the railway embankment. The upper part of the road was loose and floating, and the rail at this point was a joint, so its load-bearing capacity was weak. When the train arrived here, the force pressed down, and the road and rails lost their bearing capacity, thus causing the accident. In essence, the roadbed gave way when the train arrived here.</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>(Number of Casualties) An investigation found that the passenger train carried approximately one hundred fifty to sixty passengers in total. There were very few first-class passengers, a dozen or so second-class passengers, and the rest were all third-class passengers. That night, seventeen injured people were rescued. All seventeen suffered facial injuries. No more than ten people escaped without injury. The most tragic were the twenty-odd primary school students who boarded at Tai Po, unexpectedly encountering this disaster. There were also two people from the political circles of Guangzhou on this train, but they have not been rescued.</p>
<p>(Train Toppled into the Ditch) After the accident, the locomotive overturned and derailed. Due to the continuous heavy rain, the soil on the mountain slopes was loose. The locomotive, due to the speed of the fall into the ditch, continued to overturn towards the mountainside. The locomotive was separated from the first-class carriage by about dozens of yards. The smokestack faced the mountainside, and the first-class carriage was completely destroyed. There were very few passengers in it, and it is believed that everyone in the carriage perished tragically. The second-class carriage had not yet fallen when the accident occurred, so the second-class passengers were fortunate to escape. However, before long, the carriage also overturned. The first of the third-class carriages crashed into the bottom of the second-class carriage because it was following it, completely destroying the entire carriage, which also fell beside the mountain. The second third-class carriage was also destroyed, and the carriage at the very end was damaged in the front, while the rear remained intact.</p>
<p>(Rescue Efforts) Upon receiving news of the Guangjiu train accident, Hong Kong immediately dispatched over ten long-distance buses from the Kowloon Terminus, rented by the stationmaster, to provide rescue, and prepared to transport the passengers back to Hong Kong. The Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station also notified the Tsim Sha Tsui Fire Brigade, which dispatched two ambulances first, and then two more fire engines to assist, as everyone was not yet aware of the situation at the accident site. Around 8:00 PM, four more freight cars were dispatched, totaling over twenty vehicles dispatched from the terminus. After each vehicle arrived at the accident site, they were busy trying to rescue the injured who were trapped inside the wrecked carriages. Those who were crushed to death under the train were everywhere to be seen; the situation was extremely tragic. It was also heard that none of the passengers in the first-class carriage had been rescued, and it is thought that they had all perished. After the rescue teams dug out the injured, they first laid them on canvas beds on the ground, and then assigned people to carry them one by one along the railway road to the main road, and then transported them by car to Sha Tin, where they were transferred to ambulances and sent to the hospital for treatment. However, the number of medical personnel arriving from Hong Kong was insufficient, so dozens of local laborers were hired nearby to assist in the rescue and move the items. The work continued throughout the night, and had not been completed by the 21st. Furthermore, the tracks near Sha Tin were also damaged due to excessive rainwater. At the accident site, the railway could not be repaired until the wrecked carriages and corpses were removed. Even if repairs were to begin, they could not be completed within ten days.</p>
<p>(Railway Bureau Losses) The passenger losses could not be investigated in detail, but regarding the losses of the Railway Bureau, according to railway officials, the locomotive was worth over one hundred thousand silver dollars, and the several carriages were worth several thousand dollars each. The total loss was no less than two hundred thousand dollars, not including the future cost of repairing the railway.</p>
<p>(Traffic Suspended) That evening, the Guangjiu direct train from Hong Kong to the province was stopped at Tai Po Station. All passengers were transported back to Hong Kong from the lower road Yuan Long area by additional buses dispatched by the Railway Bureau. The express train from Guangzhou to Shenzhen also stopped its advance. The Guangjiu direct express train to Guangzhou on the 21st will be temporarily suspended until the railway is repaired, which has been announced to the public by the Railway Bureau. (21st)</p>
<h3>The Plight of the Chinese Eastern Railway Fully Exposed</h3>
<p>In Addition to Strictly Implementing Layoffs and Salary Reductions</p>
<p>A Five-Day Work Week System Has Also Been Created</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Due to poor business, the Chinese Eastern Railway has already implemented three austerity policies this year. However, income cannot cover expenditure, and the situation remains the same. According to railway regulations, employee salaries for April should have been distributed starting on the 15th of the month, without waiting until the end of the month, and the last batch of recipients would not have been paid beyond the 30th. Now, not a single cent has been issued. Some temporary budget staff in various departments have not been paid for three months. On the 16th of this month, the Russian Director, Mr. Rudei, ordered a reduction of nine-tenths of the 1,751 temporary budget items in various departments. Those originally receiving 3,000 rubles will only receive 250 rubles. The number of employees and layoffs will be at the discretion of the department heads. All those employed under the 175 budget are temporary Chinese staff. Taking the General Affairs Department alone, there are already 28 people. Due to the reduction, at least 24 or 25 people must be laid off. In total, at least 400 Chinese employees will be laid off from various departments. From a public perspective, this batch of Chinese employees who are laid off should be attributed to their own bad luck. From a private perspective, temporary budgets like the 175 are abundant, so why does the Russian Director not reduce other items? The reason is that other temporary budget items are related to Russian employees, so they are not reduced. It can be said that he is acting selfishly. The Russian Director recently suggested to the Board of Directors that if the railway's business remains poor in the future, everyone should be given a month's leave without pay. In this way, the annual salary expenditure can be reduced by one month, amounting to approximately 6 million rubles. The Board of Directors has not yet reviewed this proposal. If the road's business still does not improve in the future, it is feared that this proposal will be implemented. Currently, there is also a proposal in the Board of Directors to reduce the salaries of all railway employees. In addition to the 20% reduction that has already been implemented, it is feared that another 10% reduction will be required. Because the Chinese Director in charge of the budget, Zou Shangyou, is in Tianjin, the meeting could not be held to discuss this matter. A decision can be made after Zou returns. As for the Railway General Factory, the original quota of workers was over 2,500, including over 1,400 Chinese workers and over 900 Russian workers. After two layoffs, only over 900 Chinese workers and over 800 Russian workers remain. Since the 15th of this month, a five-day work week system has also been implemented, that is, working five days a week and resting for two days. According to the Russian Director's announcement, the implementation of this system is to save wages and maintain the method of not reducing political staff. However, this method is purely a Soviet system. There are many factories in Harbin, and there are many workers. The Eastern Railway pioneered this system, and its intention is even more unfathomable.

<h3>The Issue of Anhui Rice Exports Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Raises a Rice Public Bond of One Million</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: The issue of Anhui rice exports has been in dispute for a long time. The provincial government previously created an export rice surtax, which was reluctantly canceled due to strong opposition from merchants and the public. Subsequently, a Rice Management Bureau and an Inspection Office were established, and it was clearly ordered that rice and grain would only be allowed to leave the province after the condition of Anhui rice had been verified. Although the surtax was stopped, the rice market was also stranded, and the impact on rice merchants and various industries was even greater. In early this month, rice businesses from the seven prefectures of Luhe, rice merchants from the six counties of Anqing, various county guilds from Xuannan, rice businesses from Chaozhou and Ningbo in Wuhu, the Rice Milling Trade Association, and the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce, etc., publicly elected representatives Cui Lianggong, Li Dachu, Shen Liangrong, Wu Xingzhou, Yuan Zhongyi, and over ten others. They traveled from Wuhu to Anqing to petition Chen Tiaoyuan, the governor of Anhui, and discuss solutions with him. After several contacts and negotiations, a joint meeting was held the day before yesterday. It was agreed that both government expenses and commercial interests should be considered and a plan should be made. In the future, Anhui rice exports should consider the people's food supply, and appropriate restrictions and examinations should be carried out, but no surtax should be collected. However, after the Anhui military affairs, various construction projects are urgent and cannot be delayed, and it was decided to raise a rice public bond of one million yuan. This public bond will be collected from rice exports, with a surtax of two jiao and five fen per shi for land transportation and four jiao per shi for boat transportation, until one million yuan has been collected. The provincial government and rice merchants will each elect representatives to jointly form a committee, which will be responsible for the custody and auditing of the use of the public bond. Once the provincial government has submitted it to the central government for approval, it can be implemented. However, before implementation, all rice waiting for shipment in Wuhu will be allowed to register and export first, so that commerce and finance can be circulated. The long-unresolved rice export issue has been resolved under the understanding of officials and merchants. The representatives who went to the province have already returned to Wuhu this morning to report. (24th)</p>
<p>Local Dispatches</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Provincial Committee's Clean-up Inspection Officer Visits Songjiang: The five tasks of cleaning up the countryside in this county were scheduled to be completed by the end of March as stipulated by the province. The district sub-bureaus were unable to complete the work in time, and it was approved by the Clean-up General Bureau to extend the deadline by one month, to be completed by the end of April. The Clean-up General Bureau specially sent Inspector Hu Gui to Songjiang the day before yesterday to inspect and supervise the clean-up work. Today (the 25th), a meeting of the heads of the district sub-bureaus was convened in the county government. It was heard that for the organized self-defense corps, those already established should be reorganized according to the new regulations, and those not yet established should be actively organized. In the future, the General Bureau will also send personnel to review them. In order to promote the swift completion of the work, Cai Zhongyu, Zhang Shaomei, Tang Chengmei, and 24 others were specially appointed to form a committee to carry out all tasks.</p>
<p>Key Record of the First District Affairs Meeting: The First District Office held its 19th district affairs meeting on the 25th, presided over by District Chief Zhong. The key records are as follows: (1) Investigate abandoned temples and lewd and evil shrines, and report to the county so that they can be submitted to the provincial government for public use. It was resolved to print and distribute the promulgated regulations on temple management and the standards for retention and abolishment, and to order the township and town chiefs to report them within a limited time. (2) Broaden the streets inside and outside the city walls of this district. It was resolved that the district office should report to the county government and request local people to form a committee to be responsible for handling the matter, and to convene a meeting to discuss and review it on a regular basis. The original proposed method will be prepared for implementation. (3) The city street light donations are unequal and often omitted, and there are monthly deficits, making it difficult to expand. It is proposed to investigate in detail by section and require those who have not donated to make up the donations, in order to organize the matter. It was resolved that the district office should issue a letter to each town chief to recommend enthusiastic people from each street and alley and report to this office, so that they can be appointed as street light donation collectors, and collect donations by section on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Ministry's Approval of the Ban on Private Postal Services: The Wu County Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications regarding the Ministry of Communications' ban on private postal services, requesting that it be exempted from banning the inland river transport of letters, or that a time limit be set, in order to maintain the livelihood of commerce and industry. On the 25th, it received a reply from the Ministry of Communications. It stated that the temporary measures for private postal services to register and obtain licenses stipulate that if there is no post office, letterbox, or other village and town postal delivery service in a place of origin or destination, then the private postal service will be temporarily allowed to deliver the letters themselves. This shows that the Ministry has already taken into account the maintenance of the people's livelihood in this industry. If the desire is to allow private postal services to deliver inland letters that have already been posted, it does not comply with the existing regulations and the measures set this time, and it is difficult to approve. As for the request to refer to the provisions of Article 14 of the Regulations on the Supervision of Private Public Utilities and grant a temporary delay, the Ministry of Posts is a state-run enterprise, and the private regulations cannot be invoked. Now, in order to give special consideration, the Ministry has extended the registration deadline stated in Article 2 of the Temporary Measures for Private Postal Services to Register and Obtain Licenses to the end of the 20th year. You must inform and urge them to comply with the regulations.</p>
<p>A Family of Nine People Abducted in Dongshan: At 1:00 AM on the 24th, more than twenty lake bandits, all carrying handguns, suddenly arrived at Jianqiao, Dongting Dongshan, to the homes of residents Zhu Yongmou and Zhu Yongfu, and abducted nine men, women, and children. Also, in the Chenghu area, more than two hundred lake bandits were discovered at 7:00 AM on the 23rd. At 8:00 AM on the 24th, they abducted Hu Tongqing, Hu Yuanjiu, and Hu Yuanjian, father and sons, and Li Ni and Li Amei, a total of five people from the Hujia Dang Chefang.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Wuxi Chamber of Commerce's Position on Business Tax: The Wuxi Business Tax Collection Bureau has repeatedly received instructions from the Finance Department of Jiangsu Province, stating that the province has set April 1st as the date to start collecting the business tax, and it cannot be delayed any longer. The director, Yang Wufu, issued a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to persuade various industries to pay the tax on time. In addition to convening a meeting of various industries to discuss solutions, the Chamber of Commerce also replied to the Business Tax Bureau yesterday, expressing its views, stating: "This case has been in stalemate for a long time. The accounting year of the twentieth year is about to begin. The finances of Jiangsu Province have become deadlocked. If it is not resolved in time, it is not the way for businesses and the public to share the difficulties. The main point of contention now lies entirely in whether the tax rate is below two per mille. If the government can clearly state that the tax rate is below two per mille, it will be handled according to the set tax rate. If it is above two per mille, it will also be allowed to be changed temporarily to two per mille until the central business tax law is promulgated. Our Chamber of Commerce will do our best in Wuxi and follow your bureau, persuade various industries to start a trial run first, so as to achieve the effect of cooperation between officials and businesses. Otherwise, the Chamber of Commerce's position, coupled with the environment of various counties, I am afraid we will not be able to do anything. Please keep that in mind." Upon receiving the letter, Director Yang immediately went to the province to meet with the Director of the Finance Department to request instructions on how to proceed. The Chamber of Commerce has also scheduled to convene a meeting of various industries on the 29th to continue discussing solutions, and requested each industry to individually determine the amount of their own industry, and separately recognize the levy as a whole, and make preparations as soon as possible, with a limited time for the reply at the end of this month, so that it can be handled accordingly.</p>
<p>Robbery at a Buddhist Temple, Gunshot Wounds: There is a Guanyin Temple in Qianxiangshang, Tian Shang City, Yandai, District 6 of the county, with over ten monks and the abbot Fude. Recently, an old Jiangbei woman was hired to cook. On the 22nd, two bandits suddenly knocked on the door and entered, asking to borrow 200 yuan. Fude refused because he had no money. He immediately went to the city to hide, leaving only the old woman to watch the door. After 6:00 PM the night before last, five or six bandits, each holding a handgun, suddenly broke down the door and entered. When the villagers heard the alarm, they all rang gongs to come to their aid. The bandits fired two shots in a row, hitting Tian Gong Li Fengyuan in the head, causing blood to flow like a river. He fell to the ground injured. After the bandits searched and robbed everything, they left without gaining anything. Li Fengyuan has now hired a boat to come to the city for treatment. The injury is very serious, and there is a fear for his life.</p>
<p>Verdict in the Case of Rape of a Young Girl: Zhu Shugen, a resident of Jiang Xiang on Guangqin Road, raped Zhu Xiaoerzi, a girl under the age of sixteen nearby, on March 17th. The police station then detained him and sent him to the court for interrogation and custody. It is now learned that the prosecutor's office has completed the investigation of this case and filed a public prosecution on the charge of rape. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Yang opened the court for trial and announced the sentence of Zhu Shugen to three years and six months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<p>A Severed Limb and the Corpse of a Child Found in a Wasteland Grave: In a wasteland grave west of the Tuqiao in Yitu, Lihua Village, outside the North Gate of this county, at 2:00 PM yesterday, the corpse of a boy, about two or three years old, wearing a short shirt and trousers of gray factory cloth with stripes, was suddenly discovered. He was lying on his back, his left hand and right foot had been chopped off, and they were scattered on the edge of the field, making it unbearable to look at. However, his face had not changed color and looked as if he were sleeping soundly. A hemp rope was tied around his neck. Judging from the circumstances, it must have been that he was strangled to death before his death, and then his hands and feet were chopped off with a sharp ax, resulting in no blood stains. Afterwards, Mao Rongchu, the head of the Yitu, reported to the county court, requesting that personnel be sent to verify the matter for investigation. Prosecutor Du, accompanied by Shen Zuchan, a verification clerk, went to verify the matter. After the verification, he ordered the head of the Yitu to prepare a coffin for burial, and attached a court seal to it. He also ordered a floating coffin to be set up to await identification by the family. Afterwards, according to general speculation, this case is either a case of tearing up the ticket or a case of seizing property through enmity, and such a vicious act was committed.</p>
<p>Cantonese Xie Shirong Commits Suicide in a Hotel: In the Xinshijie Hotel under the Gongyun Bridge in this county, at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, a young traveler, dressed in luxurious clothes, arrived, claiming to be Xie Shirong, 21 years old, from Guangdong, and working for the Asia Petroleum Company in Shanghai. He booked room 38 on the second floor and paid six jiao in rent. Around 10:00 PM that night, he went to sleep. By 10:00 AM the next day, the hotel's tea attendant found that the traveler had not yet gotten up, so he opened the door and entered. He saw Xie Shirong, whose face was pale, his head stiff, and only a breath of life remained. He called out, but there was no response. He knew that he had taken poison. An empty bottle of "Anteling" tranquilizer pills and four small round iron opium boxes were found on the bed. Two boxes were empty, and two boxes had not yet been taken. He immediately reported the situation to Manager Xie Shaojing and urgently telegraphed the Tongren Hospital to invite a Western doctor to the hotel for treatment. However, due to excessive poisoning, the treatment was ineffective. After a while, he died. Xie Shaojing reported to the Second Public Security Bureau in charge, and sent the body to the hotel's guild hall.

<p>Large Fire at Daxingzhuang Market: A large fire occurred at Daxingzhuang Market in the third district of Huaiyin. The market is a bustling commercial center with a dense population and is the most prosperous market in the county. On the 19th of this month, at 1:00 PM, a fire broke out at the home of Wu Zhixiang, located inside the west Weimen gate. The fire was caused by carelessness while cooking. At the time, a strong northeast wind was blowing, and the fire started in the center of the street, quickly spreading to the shops on the west and south streets of the market. The fire was intense, and the wind was strong, making it difficult to extinguish. The fire was finally put out at 6:00 PM.

Currently, Wu Zhuxiu, the head of Daxingzhuang, is deeply concerned that nearly half of the market's buildings have been destroyed, and the southwest corner is now scorched earth.

<h3>Competition in the Rain</h3>
<p>Yesterday's meeting started on time at 1:00 PM, and spectators came in a continuous stream. The northwest and west stands were packed. Unexpectedly, just after the women's 50-meter semi-final was completed and the men's A 100-meter semi-final was about to begin, dark clouds gathered, and the sky darkened. Fine rain began to fall, growing heavier and heavier. Gusts of wind followed, and the entire field was drenched. Despite the weather, the officials decided to proceed with the competition as scheduled, holding umbrellas to continue the events in order. Their dedication is commendable. The athletes, both male and female, were not deterred by the rain, which is also admirable. The boy scouts ran around in the rain, working very hard. However, due to the wet and slippery field, the javelin and triple jump events were postponed to today. If the weather remains unfavorable today, the events will be postponed for another day.</p>

<h3>Details of the Finals</h3>
<p>Boys A Group Shot Put: Yesterday's rain had the most impact on the shot put. The shot was wet and slippery, making it difficult to grip. The landing area was muddy, making cleaning it difficult. Furthermore, the ground was slippery, making turning difficult. As a result, the performance of the twenty participants was mediocre. Xiè Quánhé from Jì'nán took first place with only 11.51 meters, and the remaining three finishers were all under 11 meters.</p>
<p>Boys B Group Shot Put: The Boys B Group Shot Put, like the men's, suffered due to the rain. Dèng Yīngyuán from Nányáng Model won the event with only 9.81 meters, achieved on his third attempt. Lín Zōngmào from Nánfāng was 0.10 meters behind in second place. Most of the final attempts were unsuccessful, which was a shame.</p>
<p>Girls Shot Put Final: Twelve athletes participated. Shèng Bì from East Asia won the event with 7.72 meters on her second attempt in the last three throws. Wáng Lányīn from Jì'nán improved to 7.58 meters on her last attempt, taking second place. It is worth noting that although only one athlete from East Asia scored points, winning first place, her throwing form was exceptionally beautiful. Her best record is reportedly over eight meters. With continued effort, she shows great promise.</p>
<p>Boys B Group 800 Meters: Originally scheduled as a preliminary race, it was changed to a final due to the small number of participants. A total of fifteen or sixteen people participated. Liú Chónglǐ from Pǔdōng led from start to finish. The difference between second and third place was only inches. The winning time was 2 minutes and 34 seconds.</p>
<p>From Right to Left "Above" First Place East Asia Team in Girls 400-Meter Relay Qián Xíngsù, Zhāng Píngshān, Xià Fēnlǜ, Shèng Bì "Below" First Place Jì'nán Team in A Group 1600-Meter Relay Yǐn Guìrén, Zhāng Jìyǒu, Yáng Bǐngyuán, Zēng Róngzhōng</p>
<p>Men's Relay Race: Eight schools participated in the Men's A Group 1600-meter relay. Jì'nán was in the lead from the first leg. Pǔdōng was about two or three feet behind. Pǔdōng closed the gap in the second leg but could not overtake. Pǔdōng fell behind in the third leg, and Jì'nán took first place. Pǔdōng was second, Guǎngzhào was third, and Dàxià was fourth.</p>
<p>Women's Relay Race: Four schools participated in the Women's 400-meter relay. Xuě Zhìjié from Wùběn had a great start and was in the lead. Unfortunately, the team faltered after the first leg. East Asia quickly caught up, and Shèng Bì secured first place in the third leg. In the end, Southeast finished second, China third, and Wùběn last.</p>

<h3>Two Organizations Telegraph Request for Thorough</h3>
<p>Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating: "To the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Negotiations for the abolition of consular jurisdiction have been ongoing for years, and the people have long awaited their conclusion. According to recent newspaper reports, only the Netherlands and Norway have reached agreements, while others are hesitant and waiting. The proposed counter-proposals are far from the true meaning of abolishing consular jurisdiction. This attitude is inconsistent with the current international trend and is against the wishes of the entire Chinese people. The origin of consular jurisdiction stems from European Muslim countries and spread to the East. Today, with the rise of justice, European ideas have also changed. European countries have successively revised treaties and abandoned their decades-old privileges with smaller countries like Siam and Persia. China is a major power in East Asia with a vast territory and abundant resources. Its commercial relations are far greater than those of Siam and other countries. If countries want to maintain their commercial and friendly relations, they should follow the world trend and meet our country's expectations. However, the hesitating countries have especially close commercial ties with us. Their policies are contradictory. We request that you consider this negotiation, which is at a critical juncture, and firmly insist on a thorough resolution. If the negotiations fail, then we must resort to decisive measures. The example of Turkey is before us and is not without precedent in our country. We respectfully submit our humble opinions for your consideration. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association: The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government yesterday, stating: "To His Excellency Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Nanjing National Government: We have heard that the agreements on legal rights between China and the Netherlands and China and Norway have been signed. The main points of the content are (1) All provisions regarding consular jurisdiction enjoyed by the two countries in China are immediately abolished; (2) The peoples of the contracting countries shall be subject to the laws and courts of the country in which they reside. In addition, the Sino-Brazilian agreement is about to be signed, and the UK and the US are also on the verge of resolving the issue, demonstrating your great achievements in negotiation. All citizens are deeply pleased and hopeful that after the legal rights are resolved, the desire to recover the concessions will also be realized soon. The convocation of a National Assembly and the abolition of unequal treaties, which were earnestly entrusted by the Premier, can all be realized one by one, not only bringing glory to the legal profession but also to the party and the country. We respectfully send this telegram to express our congratulations and hope for your consideration. Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association."</p>
<h3>County Party Consolidation Committee Circular Telegram</h3>
<p>Abolish Unequal Treaties</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Consolidation Committee issued a circular telegram yesterday, stating: "To all county and city party departments, public organizations, and newspapers: Only with the survival of the nation can there be the survival of the people. Only with national freedom can there be freedom for the people. The people are the foundation of the nation, and the nation is the mother of the people. Looking around China's vast territory of several million square miles and its hundreds of millions of suffering people, there is not a single blade of grass or tree that has not been ravaged by the footsteps of imperialists. There is not a single piece of clothing or meal that has not been bound by the economics of the imperialists. Who is responsible for this, and what caused it? The reason lies in the unequal treaties, which have not yet been abolished. The rampant behavior of imperialists in China, raping our women, slaughtering our compatriots, is increasingly unrestrained, and is guaranteed by unequal treaties. Imperialists send large numbers of warships to sail inland, survey our situation, bombard our vital points, and infringe upon our sovereignty, making it difficult to seek redress, and this is sheltered by unequal treaties. Imperialists invest in various places, set up factories, exploit our resources, and suck our blood. Foreign goods flood the market, but we cannot exclude them, and this is planted by unequal treaties. Furthermore, imperialists fund warlords, transport military equipment, fuel internal strife, obstruct the revolution, and undermine world peace, without being subject to the rulings of international law, and they rely on unequal treaties to exacerbate this. Such cases are too numerous to recount. In short, unequal treaties are the sharp weapon of imperialists to invade weak nations and the talisman for imperialists to preserve themselves. If unequal treaties are not abolished, the shackles of capitalist imperialism cannot be lifted, the Chinese nation will have no freedom to speak of, and our 400 million compatriots will have no hope of escaping the abyss of suffering. Therefore, the abolition of unequal treaties requires the unity of the entire nation, working together to achieve it. Now that the initial work of the National Revolution has been completed, and the country is unified and construction is beginning, imperialists are deeply jealous and have repeatedly sought to sabotage this. They cling to their unequal treaties to obstruct our tutelage government and the progress of construction, hindering the development of our revolutionary future. Therefore, the abolition of unequal treaties is a matter of urgent action and cannot be delayed. Our late Premier always advocated the abolition of unequal treaties as his most cherished goal. Even on his deathbed, he repeatedly instructed his comrades to expedite the realization of this goal in the shortest possible time. The National Assembly, which is about to open, is a combination of the will of the people of the entire country, and the common desire is to make the demand for the abolition of unequal treaties a prerequisite. The National Assembly should use revolutionary means to automatically declare all unequal treaties invalid. If imperialists are unwilling to give up and cause obstacles, the entire nation is willing to use the determination to not give up until the goal is achieved as the support. Ultimate victory can definitely be obtained. What we have announced here, we hope that all comrades and compatriots will rise up together, pool our wisdom and efforts, and realize this goal. May the Party and the country be fortunate."</p>

Meanwhile, he has instructed the department to handle the conclusion of the matter, and yesterday posted a detailed announcement in front of the government office, stating the total number of votes for the Farmers' Association, Education Association, and Lawyers' Association, the number of invalid votes, and the number of votes received by each candidate, so that the public may be informed.</p>
<h3>Waters off Songkou</h3>
<p>Pirates Gradually Being Suppressed</p>
<p>Fishing Boats Have All Put to Sea</p>
<p>The 4th District of the Wusong Water Police received a telegram from District Chief Zhang Han yesterday, stating that the army, police, and naval fleet, on the 18th, divided into routes to surround and suppress Daan Port and Lüsi Market, completely defeating the bandits of Yan Zhenling, Song Lisan, and others who were entrenched in the waters there. They fled north in bandit ships through the intersecting waterways. In the Xiaheisha area, the water police gunboats and naval warships also fiercely attacked and dispersed the pirates. The waters in all these areas are now completely clear, with no trace of pirates. All coastal fishermen in the counties of Tongchang, Haiqi, and others have now resumed their businesses, and more than 700 fishing boats, under the protection of the Hai Fu and other warships, sailed to the sea to fish on the 21st. After the pirates were defeated, they fled to the waters around Juegang, Fengli, and Pincha in the Ru district. District Chief Zhang immediately directed the army and police to pursue and suppress them. On the 22nd, the pirates in the waters belonging to Haimen County were cleared, and on the 23rd, they pursued and suppressed the pirates in the waters of the Ru district. The pirates, after this large-scale suppression by the government forces, are becoming increasingly impoverished. The time for their annihilation should not be far off. District Chief Zhang recently received a report that a large group of pirates has gathered in the waters of Yancheng County, led by the bandit chief Zhong Shaokuan, whose power is also extremely rampant. District Chief Zhang will lead his troops directly to Yancheng to suppress them after the pirates in the waters of the Ru district have been suppressed.</p>
<h3>Measures to Relieve Zhejiang Cocoons</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Organizations and Government</p>
<p>Pre-Planning Relief Methods</p>
<p>Sericulture is a major part of the agricultural production of Zhejiang Province. This year, affected by the silk market, there is concern that the supply of silkworm cocoons may exceed demand. On the 11th of this month, the Shanghai Zhejiang Association held a board meeting and resolved to take measures to relieve the silkworm cocoons. They suggested this to the Zhejiang Construction Department, which has now replied by telegram and formulated four measures, ordering the governments of each county to comply. If they can be faithfully implemented, it may still be possible to remedy the situation. Otherwise, the livelihood of farmers will be greatly affected. The telegrams to and from, and the four measures, are disclosed as follows:</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Association Telegram to the Zhejiang Construction Department</h3>
<p>To Director Shi of the Zhejiang Construction Department: Since Zhejiang Province promoted improved silk reeling and abolished the cocoon market regulations, cocoon factories have sprung up everywhere. The total number in the province should not be less than a thousand. The villagers also find it more convenient to sell cocoons than to reel silk, so in recent years, reeling machines and all silk reeling equipment have been mostly destroyed. However, the cocoon factories in various places mostly lease from the silk factories in Shanghai every year, or purchase surplus cocoons and resell them to the silk factories. The number of silk factories that set up their own factories to build stoves to bake cocoons and reel silk has always been small. Since the decline of this year's silk market, most of the silk factories in Shanghai have ceased operations, which has made it difficult for the inland cocoon factories to find buyers when the silkworm season is approaching. It can be predicted that the supply of silkworm cocoons this year will exceed demand. If the silkworm harvest is abundant, villagers will inevitably have difficulty selling their cocoons, not only suffering losses due to monopoly and low prices, but also easily causing moths and mildew. This has a significant impact on the rural economy. We propose the following relief methods, listed on the left: (1) Encourage villagers to set up stoves to bake cocoons themselves. Order the construction bureaus or departments of each county government, as well as the district and township offices and village committees, to universally encourage villagers to raise funds to build stoves to bake cocoons themselves, and keep them for reeling silk or selling at a later date, so as to avoid the above-mentioned losses and still receive considerable benefits. (2) Use closed cocoon factories to bake cocoons for the people. There are now cocoon factories scattered everywhere. Since it is difficult to lease them this year, the number of closed factories will inevitably be more than in previous years. We can take this opportunity to use them, allowing local organizations or individuals to find ways to borrow them, slightly compensating for the repair costs, and recruiting workers to bake cocoons for the people, charging a baking fee. However, the fees must be regulated and not raised arbitrarily, only recovering the cost. The staff and all expenses in the factory should be minimized. However, this kind of business is for the convenience of the people and does not contain any trading nature. The cocoon industry business tax and the future cocoon industry special tax should be exempted. The dried cocoons should also be allowed to be sold directly to local silk factories by the villagers, and the bad habits such as brokers' commissions should be prohibited. The above two items are intended to relieve the current situation, but the future development of the sericulture industry is no different. As far as our association's limited vision can reach, we make a special suggestion, hoping that your director will adopt and implement it. Now, the silkworm business is booming. If this case is approved, please order each subordinate to organize in time to avoid delays. We are deeply grateful. Shanghai Zhejiang Association bows respectfully.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Construction Department's Reply to the Zhejiang Association</h3>
<p>To the Shanghai Zhejiang Association: We have respectfully received your telegram. We are deeply impressed by your association's concern for your hometown and enthusiasm for the silk industry. Regarding your request, we have already received a telegram from the Jiaxing County Cocoon Industry Association requesting that we plan a method to relieve the sale of cocoons to the department. We have already formulated four measures, ordering the governments of the four old prefectures of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Shaoxing to comply, and to make appropriate arrangements according to local conditions. The telegram from the previous telegram should be copied and sent to your association, please take the trouble to check and assist in the promotion and implementation. Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department Director Shi Ying's stamp.</p>
<h3>Four Measures for Zhejiang Province to Relieve the Sale of Cocoons</h3>
<p>(1) County and municipal governments should supervise their affiliated sericulture organizations and village committees to quickly organize public cocoon baking stoves in areas where sericulture is prosperous, and charge appropriate labor and fuel costs, so that silkworm farmers can kill the pupae and dry the cocoons when there is no place to sell them, in order to avoid the loss of moths emerging. (2) County and municipal governments should encourage silkworm farmers to organize dried cocoon sales cooperatives, so that the dried cocoons of each household can be collected from zero to whole, making them easier to sell. (3) Most of the capital for farmers to raise silkworms comes from high-interest loans, which are usually repaid after the new cocoons are harvested and reeled into native silk. County and municipal governments should negotiate with appropriate banks and other lending institutions to issue low-interest dried cocoon mortgage loans to facilitate turnover and avoid selling at low prices in a hurry. (4) Warehouses are usually set up for commodity mortgages. County and municipal governments should encourage silkworm farmers to rent cocoon storage warehouses owned by local cocoon firms in order to ensure proper care and avoid damage.</p>
<h3>Unanimous Claim of Officials and Merchants</h3>
<p>Regulate the Import of Foreign Flour, Rice, and Wheat</p>
<p>Grain and Flour Industries Petition</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau has Already Forwarded the Situation</p>
<p>Foreign flour, rice, and wheat in this city have been continuously imported, not only endangering farmers, but also economically invading grain merchants, making it difficult to maintain their businesses. Various rice industry groups and flour mill guilds have successively petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting ways to provide relief. The bureau believes that if the foreign grain is continuously imported without restriction, it will be detrimental to the country's wealth and the people's livelihood. Therefore, it has forwarded the situation to the municipal government, requesting that it be forwarded to the Executive Yuan for approval of restrictive measures. The petition is recorded as follows: The petition is for the matter of the petition. According to the joint petition of the Jiangsu Ninghu Municipal and County Rice Industry Association, foreign wheat imports are endangering farmers. The flour mills in this city have ordered more than 10 million yuan worth of foreign wheat from abroad, and more than half of it has been shipped in, and the rest will continue to be imported, so that domestic wheat not only suffers from the pain of low prices due to the squeeze of goods, but also seeks to sell and is not available. This is tantamount to robbing farmers of their resources for cultivating fields and making them wait for death empty-handed. For this reason, please forward a clear order to prohibit the import of foreign wheat in order to alleviate the suffering of the people. It is being handled. Subsequently, the Grain Dealers Association petitioned that foreign wheat, foreign flour, and foreign rice have been continuously imported, and grain merchants and farmers have been economically invaded, making it difficult to maintain their businesses, and will affect the whole country and social unrest. Please forward the petition to find a way to prohibit imports, or temporarily increase import duties, in order to provide relief, so that the farmers' economy will not go bankrupt, in order to maintain the national lifeline and prevent leaks. According to the situation, it is appropriate for the flour manufacturers in this city to disregard their own interests and abuse the purchase of foreign wheat, which will not only endanger the livelihood of farmers, but also harm themselves if it is not stopped. The advantages and disadvantages have been stated in the office's petition to organize the registration rules for the import of grain. On the one hand, we ordered the Flour Mill Association in this city to forward the order to the industry to temporarily suspend the continued purchase of foreign wheat, and to register the wheat that has been ordered but not yet arrived on the date of the bureau. Now, according to the reply, the registration should be followed, but the continuous import of foreign flour will make the sales of domestic flour exhausted, which is a great disadvantage to the country's flour. Please prohibit the import of foreign flour in order to maintain the business and other words. It has been found that the large-scale import of foreign wheat and the sharp drop in prices are indeed a great hindrance to the economy of domestic farmers, and the import of foreign flour, if not limited, will make the country's flour sales be seized, and farmers and merchants will be trapped, and the country's wealth will be damaged, all of which are within the plan. Recently, the Soviet Union, in order to promote the realization of the new economic policy, did not hesitate to order the people of the whole country to tighten their belts and starve, and dumped grain overseas. The United States has no good policy for the disposal of excess wheat production and is planning to sell it extensively. European countries, in order to protect themselves, have built high walls and deep trenches to prevent the import of foreign surplus grain. Our country has been barren for years, since last year's great harvest, farmers have been suffering from the sharp fall in grain prices, and the government is worried about maintaining it without success. If we sit idly by and watch the continuous import of foreign flour, rice, and wheat without restriction, farmers will abandon their plows, merchants will stop working, and the people's food will be guaranteed, but the damage to the country's wealth and the people's livelihood will have been incalculable. It seems that we should quickly set a policy to protect farmers and merchants, adjust the people's food, and the request to increase import duties was previously transferred to the city's Grain Committee, please instruct the case of grain import tax as soon as possible, and received the instructions of the seventh nine seven zero of the government, it is on record. Now, the rice, wheat, and flour industries have petitioned for relief, and the circumstances are more serious. Should we approve the request? We should copy the original petition and submit it to the chief for review and approval, and forward it to the Executive Yuan for approval, which is in the public interest. Respectfully presented to Mayor Zhang.</p>
<h3>Rome International Agricultural Institute</h3>
<p>Concerned About Our Country's Agricultural Methods</p>
<p>Those Who Wish to Read the Institute's Special Issue</p>
<p>Can Contact Zeng Yi Jun</p>
<p>The Rome International Agricultural Institute (Institut International d'Agriculture à Rome) is the earliest and greatest institution in the international community for honing academic and practical skills, and together with the newly established League of Nations and the International Labour Office after the European War, it forms today's three major international organizations. At the beginning of the institute's establishment, the late Qing government had joined, but our country's previous corrupt diplomatic circles did not fully introduce this large international organization for discussing agricultural administration and agronomy to the Chinese people, which is deeply regrettable.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>In October of the 17th year of the Republic of China, Dr. Zeng Yi, secretary of the European branch of the New China Agricultural Society, was entrusted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines of the National Government to participate in the institute's ninth congress. After returning to China, he did his best to introduce it, and China's agricultural community gradually learned about the outline of the institute, recognizing that the facilities of this magnificent institution are closely related to our country's agricultural improvement based on agriculture. Recently, Dr. Zeng received a letter from the institute's Secretary-General, Q. Perris, requesting that the institute has not received our country's government gazettes since the 12th year of the Republic of China, and requesting the National Government's Gazette, the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines' Gazette (now the Ministry of Industry's Gazette) in full, and the agricultural methods recently promulgated by the National Government for reference. Mr. Zeng received the institute's two huge volumes of the International Agricultural Methods of the 18th and 19th years of the Republic of China (in French), and the institute's 25th anniversary special issue. Those who wish to borrow them can write to Zeng Yi Jun at 899 Xiafei Road.</p>
<h3>Tariff Research Association</h3>
<p>Petition to Reduce or Exempt Business Tax</p>
<p>The Tariff Research Committee of the various trade associations in this city petitioned the municipal government yesterday for the reduction or exemption of business tax on longan and native cloth, stating: The petition is to collect and report on the situation, hoping for consideration and approval. The establishment of business tax is a major reform in our country's tax system. At the beginning of the preparation, exploration is not afraid to seek details, so that the country's treasury is prosperous and the people's livelihood is planned, and it is a good and perfect tax system for the country. The reason why the association is not afraid to repeatedly report is precisely for this reason. Now the draft of the business tax rate in this city has been drafted by the Municipal Finance Bureau and announced to solicit opinions from all industries. We express our respect. However, the business tax rate in this city is 2 per mille for the fruit industry and the north-south goods industry, while the longan industry is 5 per mille, which seems unfair. Although there are operators specializing in this industry in this city, in the inland ports, it is also sold by the north-south goods industry. The nature of the two is the same, and there is no doubt, and it belongs to the same category as the fruit industry, and there should be no different tax rates. It should be requested to reduce the tax on the pillar circle industry to 2 per mille to show the average, this is one. The native cloth industry is a rare handicraft industry in our country. In the era of complicated gold, it was still exempted from tax and gold. The business tax currently held is to compensate for the loss of local cuts. The industry has never had gold, and there is no loss to cut. There is no need to plan for its compensation. It should be ordered to exempt it, this is two. Now we are allowed to send letters to the meeting from the industry, and it is reasonable to submit the document for transfer. We hope that the review and compliance will be for the public benefit.

<h3>Yangtze China Wheel Restores Original State</h3>
<p>Twenty-Eight Wheels Up and Downstream Have Started</p>
<p>After the end of the military transport, the Yangtze River Shipping Lines, China Merchants, Sanbei, Ningshao, etc., have all resumed their shifts, and the Zhaoxing Wheel also runs two ships as usual. Currently, there are 20 Yangtze River ships running in the Shanghai-Hankou shift, and 8 ships are sailing in the upstream shift, with business as usual. The matters of protection and rent revelation are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>(Wheel Protection) In recent months, the Yangtze River ships have been harassed by gambling bandits. The Shanghai Shipping Industry Union telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang for troops to protect them and issued a strict ban. The headquarters replied to the Shipping Association that it was approved, but ordered that the current ships running up and down the Yangtze River should be reported in a single list so that troops can be sent to protect them. The Shipping Association has found out that the current ships of the three companies have been sent to the headquarters. In addition to Jiangshun and Jianguo, which have already sent military police on board, the other Yangtze River ships that have not been sent troops, the companies received a telegram from the capital yesterday, saying that the Garrison Department has transferred a team of military police from Changzhou, exclusively for the need to station ships to escort them. Each Yangtze River ship passing through Beijing can go to the department to request them to be sent.</p>
<p>(Rent) In May of last year, the Ministry of Finance rented 25 merchant ships. In addition to the ship rent and coal expenses that have been received, there is still an outstanding amount of more than 60,000 yuan. The date has been long, and it has not been received. The companies concerned have sent personnel to Beijing to request it.</p>

<h3>Cracking Down on Japanese Fishing Patrols in China</h3>
<p>A Glimpse of the Japanese's Tough Attitude</p>
<p>Sending Warships to Expel: The Zhejiang Offshore Water Police Department received an order from the province stating that the Zhejiang East Sea is the time when our country's fishing boats are fishing in large numbers. Recently, Japanese trawlers and fishing boats have come in droves, encroaching on our maritime rights and sinking our fishing boats. This has happened many times. Two water police teams and two warships have been specially dispatched to the Zhejiang East Sea to protect our country's fishing boats. If Japanese fishing boats arrive, they will be expelled immediately.</p>
<p>Japanese News: Our country will implement a ban on the import of Japanese fishing boats under 100 tons from May 1st, and at the same time, Japanese fishing boats are not allowed to sell fish into our country. The Japanese were panicked. It is confirmed that the three places that Japanese fishing boats value most are Shanghai Qingdao Andong. If they cannot win the current situation, they will definitely use the Shandong Treaty to justify their fishing rights in Qingdao, and they will never give up this fishing right. Otherwise, they will take decisive action.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Sino-French Academic Expedition</h3>
<p>The Sino-French Academic Expedition, the members of both sides, gathered in Peiping, ready to go. Unexpectedly, the caterpillar car's belt was damaged, and the repair and replacement took time, so the departure date was postponed. Now we have learned various news about the group, compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Restore the Name: The Sino-French Academic Expedition, referring to the 1919 Academic Expedition, also used this name when requesting passports from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Later, the leader Chu Minyi changed to the current name because 1919 had passed. Now, in order to unify the name and avoid difficulties after departure, the French side, after consulting with our side, decided to restore the name and use the original name of the 1919 Academic Expedition.</p>
<p>Issue Letters of Appointment: It has been found that the group is jointly organized by the Chinese Academic Associations and the French side. After the members of both sides were announced, letters of appointment have not yet been issued. Now, in order to be serious about the matter, the association specially issued letters of appointment to the leader Chu Minyi, members Jiao Jihua, Yao Xijiu, Zhou Baohan, Liu Shen'e, Hao Jingsheng, Yang Zhongjian, Zheng Zinan, and others, and French leader Hart, deputy leader Shibuzhu, members Le Wuli, Shi Hui, Youzhao, Bu'an, Fei Wenmin, De Rijin, Naimonsbeide, De La, and others.</p>
<p>Repair Vehicles: After the caterpillar car departed from Peiping to Changping County, the French craftsmen immediately processed and repaired the damaged wheel belt. The repair has now been completed. However, this type of belt is specially made, only 20 pieces, and 13 pieces have been damaged. Therefore, a telegram was sent to the French Citroen Automobile Factory to quickly manufacture new belts and transport them to Peiping for replacement. However, this type of belt will not be manufactured until two weeks later. It will take another two weeks to transport them from Siberia to Peiping, so the departure date has to be postponed.</p>
<p>Departure Date: After the caterpillar car is repaired, it has been driven from Nankou to Zhangjiakou. It is expected that it can be driven from Zhangjiakou to Bailingmiao on May 20. If the legally made rubber belt is transported on schedule, it can depart from Bailingmiao to Xinjiang on May 27.</p>
<p>Chu's Return to Beijing: The leader Chu Minyi decided to return to Beijing because there was still more than a month before the departure date. Now, at the request of the North China Drama Association, he is performing at the First Stage in Peiping to raise money. After the matter is over, he plans to go to Beijing with Deputy Commander Zhang and Wu Tiecheng at the end of the month to attend the National Assembly before going north again to meet with the French members and depart.</p>
<h3>Customs Union Sets Tomorrow as Date for Resumption of Work</h3>
<p>And Effective Immediately, Dismantling of Inspection Teams</p>
<p>Cotton Fabric Guild to Hold General Meeting Today</p>
<p>Regarding the stevedore strike of customs workers in this city, after the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to mediate the dispute with the Cotton Fabric Guild, the Customs Brokers Guild, and the Labor Union two days ago, the Customs Labor Union has complied with the order to resume work tomorrow. However, the Cotton Fabric Guild is awaiting a members' meeting today to make a decision. Details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Customs Labor Union General Meeting: Yesterday at 8 PM, the Customs Labor Union held a general meeting of all members. Over two hundred people attended, including Ren Xinxiang and Su Houxin. Chairman Su Houxin first reported on the final mediation process by the Social Affairs Bureau. He then presented Decree No. 9241 received on the 25th of this month, along with the revised agreement agreed upon by all three parties. Discussions then began, including: (1) The Social Affairs Bureau's directive, instructing the Labor Union to inform workers to resume work immediately. A resolution was passed to comply with the government's order and to resume work on Monday (the 27th). However, if after resuming work, the Cotton Fabric Guild creates further complications or does not recognize the three-party agreement, a second strike will be held. This was passed unanimously. (2) The proposal to require the Customs Labor Union's stamp for collecting cotton fabric handling fees was passed. (3) The inspection teams will be disbanded immediately.</p>
<p>Cotton Guild Holds General Meeting: After receiving the Social Affairs Bureau's directive yesterday, the Cotton Fabric Guild determined that the five modified articles of the compromise draft proposed by the Social Affairs Bureau had not been agreed upon by all members and required further discussion. A members' meeting is scheduled for 2 PM today to discuss all matters before submitting a report to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for verification.</p>
<h3>Refining Industry Dispute Subject to Mediation Hearing</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Schedules Inquiry for Tomorrow</p>
<p>The refining industry's year-end settlement has led to price disputes with the silk industry, which have remained unresolved for a long time. It is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau has specifically scheduled a meeting for the two industries' representatives at the Bureau at 1 PM on April 27th to discuss solutions.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers Association Urges</h3>
<p>Municipal Council to Improve Defense</p>
<p>And Requests Eradication of Gambling and Strict Prohibition of Illegal Levies</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association wrote to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "To the Director: It is noted that the primary task of municipal authorities is to maintain public security. Therefore, the percentage of total recurring expenses used to maintain public security is usually higher than other items. The public safety situation within the Settlement, such as kidnapping and robbery cases, occurs frequently, almost to the point of steady decline. However, the Municipal Council's police expenditure has been actively and significantly increasing, as shown in the following table: One year before the Republic, 854,499 (unit: taels); 1921, 1,646,000; 1926, 2,537,464; 1927, 2,937,118; 1928, 3,220,476; 1929, 3,861,180; 1930, 5,651,955; 1931 (budget), 6,708,790. As shown in the table above, police expenditure has increased by eight hundred percent in twenty years. But what about the results? The Municipal Council should have the same feeling as the Association, that it is impossible to meet the expectations and serious trust of those who pay taxes. Although the current situation cannot be compared to that of twenty years ago, the expenses also cannot be considered equivalent. Why is it that the outcome remains where it was, and not better than before? This Association, representing the interests of over 95% of the residents, has a deeper concern about public security. Therefore, it proposed six measures last year, and the Municipal Council claimed to have conducted in-depth research on the maintenance of public security. However, no results have been seen to date. Is the increase of one million taels in the budget this year compared to last year the method derived from this research? Military strategy states, 'Know the enemy and know yourself, and you will not be defeated in a hundred battles.' This Association believes that this principle should also apply to police work. Municipal Council Chairman Fessenden stated that Chinese people do not cooperate with the Municipal Council and do not report incidents. However, as far as this Association knows, reporting is often ignored, and reporting is often suppressed. Moreover, senior police officers are generally foreigners, who mostly do not speak the language and have different mentalities. Repeated translations are enough to obscure police opportunities, and superficial investigations are enough to grasp shadows and catch wind. Therefore, this Association believes that if the Council does not appoint Chinese people with police knowledge, experience, and ability to senior police positions, merely increasing police expenditure will not fully achieve the function of maintaining public security. It will only increase the burden on taxpayers. Furthermore, kidnapping and robbery are major enemies of public security, and gambling is the seed of crime. The Council has now eradicated the two major gambling evils of roulette and dog racing, which is truly satisfying. However, eradicating evil must be thorough, as stated in ancient teachings. All gambling that harms the populace should be treated by the Council as kidnapping and robbery and be completely eradicated. There is another matter that cannot be left unsaid. According to reports, some police inspectors of higher rank are taking advantage of their positions to collect illegal levies and solicit gifts. If this is indeed the case, even if the Council's various regulations stipulate not giving money to Municipal Council personnel, how can residents not fear that they will be deliberately harassed and made difficult? Therefore, according to the resolution of the General Assembly of Representatives, we hereby request that you investigate and actively improve defense, eradicate kidnapping and robbery, eliminate gambling, and strictly prohibit civil servants from soliciting illegal levies, etc."</p>

<h3>Joint Meeting of Baoshan Agencies</h3>
<p>The Baoshan County Party Headquarters convened a joint meeting of the Party and government at 10 AM yesterday, gathering various bureaus of finance, construction, education, census, as well as various agencies such as the pond works and transportation fund properties.

(2) For national memorial days and Party memorial days, all agencies, organizations, and schools must participate in full. The responsible personnel of each unit should be responsible for complying with the regulations to show solemnity. It was resolved and passed. (3) The county's security expenses will be supplemented by a one-time levy of silver of 1.5 yuan per mu of sandy fields. A continued request should be submitted to the provincial government for prompt approval. It was resolved that the conference should send a letter to the county to request the province to approve the request. (4) Regarding the case of Xu Yanfu of the Fifth District selling military supplies, which has been accepted by the county government, a resolution should be made as soon as possible. It was resolved that the conference should send a letter to the county to resolve the case promptly.</p>
<h3>Yang Shengzhi's Funeral Procession Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Coffin Transported to Beijing by Night Train</p>
<p>Yang Shengzhi, commander of the Second Division of the Army, has fought in numerous battles and made contributions to the Party and the nation. He passed away in Shanghai a month ago. The National Government has issued an order to posthumously award him the rank of General and to provide generous compensation. A funeral committee was established in the capital, Mochou Lake, with Garrison Commander Gu Zhenglun in charge. Yesterday (the 25th) at 12 noon, the coffin was moved from his residence at Xingye Lane, Xiafei Road, to the North Railway Station. The British and French police were requested to send officers to patrol and protect along the route through the Settlement to show respect. Armed forces specially dispatched by the Songhu Garrison Command escorted the coffin to the station, with a grand and solemn ceremony. The coffin was transported to Beijing by night train last night, escorted by Yang Shengbin, the deceased commander's fourth younger brother, for a selection of a date for the funeral service, which is expected to be another grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Appeals on Behalf of He Zhi</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has received repeated letters from He Zhi, style name Tongyu, 25 years old, from Lufeng County, Yunnan Province. He graduated from the Sichuan Military Academy and served as a staff officer and advisor to Wu Peifu, with the rank of Lieutenant General. Last November, he came to Shanghai from the north with his wife and two young daughters, residing at the Ping'an Hotel on Zhu Bao San Road in the French Concession, owing over 270 yuan in room and board fees. He was forced to the point of being unable to bear it and considered suicide, feeling unable to face his family and country. He requested relief. The Bureau sent personnel to investigate and met with He's wife, 21 years old, and two daughters, four and two years old. They recounted their experiences with tears streaming down their faces. The Bureau also inquired with the hotel, which confirmed the facts. The Bureau also summoned Wu Zhi (as written in the original text, it is unclear whether it is He or Wu, and cannot be determined) to the Bureau for questioning. His statements were the same as before, stating that he had been working in the north and had no relatives or friends in Shanghai. His family still had ancestral property sufficient to live on, but it was controlled by his brothers, who intended to make things difficult for him and cause him to wander in other places, unable to return home. The reason for their family conflict was that he had a good reputation in the north while in office, which was spread to his hometown. This led his brothers to repeatedly write letters requesting jobs, which he did not promote, thus harboring resentment. He now intends to request compensation for travel expenses to return to Hubei to avoid wandering. Observing his handsome appearance, composed demeanor, and purely military bearing, he does not seem to be someone who is falsely claiming. The estimated cost for the last relief effort is at least 250 yuan. The Bureau's budget is limited, making it difficult to allocate funds for relief. In addition to having telegraphed the Yunnan Civil Affairs Department to request that they telegraph major merchants in Shanghai to find a way to provide assistance to return to their hometown, it is believed that there is no shortage of charitable people in Shanghai. A special appeal is being made on his behalf. If you are willing to donate generously, please send it to the Bureau for transfer, which would be a great act of merit.</p>

<h3>Martin Discusses the Settlement</h3>
<p>Anti-Theft Car Squad</p>
<p>Will Soon Be Realized</p>
<p>Municipal Council Police Chief Martin gave a speech at the Chinese YMCA yesterday afternoon, titled "Police Affairs in the Settlement." Martin said that the Settlement Police Department is actively working on theft prevention. They have already organized a car patrol team and purchased 120 special vehicles, each equipped with radio. Over a hundred alarm telephones are being installed in sections throughout the Settlement for reporting. When kidnapping and theft cases occur in the city, the patrol police in the cars can receive the signal and immediately proceed to the scene to investigate the case. The police officers in the patrol team are currently being trained by the Municipal Council. The training period is eighteen months, with the first nine months teaching various arrest methods and the latter nine months spent on service for practical exercises. The nine months of instruction are nearing completion, so the patrol police car team will soon be realized in the Settlement. Martin also said that in the past, arrest cases were often handled by detectives and assistants who went out to gather information. The Police Department has also improved on this point. In the future, no matter what case occurs, the head detective will be personally responsible for handling it.</p>

<h3>Opium Hidden in Mail</h3>
<p>Weighing Dozens of Pounds</p>
<p>Has Been Seized by the Post Office</p>
<p>The post office has long been paying attention to the illegal concealment of prohibited items in packages. The local post office recently inspected a large package marked "Printed Matter" addressed to Beiping. The package was mailed by the Ziqiang Bookstore in Jinjia Pai Lou, Hucheng.

<h3>Russian Man Brazenly Acts</h3>
<p>Striking a Chinese Man to Death</p>
<p>Police Have Filed a Public Prosecution</p>
<p>Trial Scheduled for April 29th</p>
<p>Russian man Marxsky, employed at the Lao La Mai Candy Company at 100 Great Western Road in West Shanghai, whose owner is also a Russian expatriate, argued with Liu Jinshan, a servant from Hebei working at the company, over a cloth to wipe the table at 9 AM on the 11th of last month. The argument escalated, and Marxsky became violent, punching Liu beside the ear. Although Liu was only 24 years old, at the prime of his youth, Marxsky was physically strong. Upon being struck, Liu immediately fell to the ground, becoming unconscious. The Jing'an Temple police station in charge of the area was notified and immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. Seeing that Liu had not regained consciousness, they took him to the nearby Red Cross Hospital for treatment and arrested Marxsky. The next morning, they escorted him to the Special District Court, accusing him of assault. Presiding Judge Ge Zhitan postponed the hearing after briefly questioning the defendant, as the victim had not been present. Unexpectedly, Liu suffered serious injuries from the strike, and the doctors' treatment was ineffective, with his condition worsening daily. By the day before yesterday, he was in critical condition. Fearing that the injured man would die, the police requested Judge Ge and the Prosecutor to visit the hospital to obtain a statement for the purpose of the trial. However, when the judge arrived at the hospital, Liu was still unconscious, lying in bed with faint breaths, and they were unable to obtain a statement from him. He died the night before last, and his mother, Liu Li, was understandably grief-stricken. That night, the police sent detectives to transport the body to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo from the Special Court visited the office and confirmed that the death was caused by the strike. The body was handed over to his mother with a signed receipt for the coffin and burial. As the nature of the case had expanded, the police determined that the original charges were no longer applicable and have now changed the charges to Article 296 of the Criminal Law, "injury resulting in death," and filed a lawsuit against Marxsky. It is reported that the trial is scheduled for April 29th.</p>

<h3>No Swimming Pool on North Sichuan Road</h3>
<p>Only the Jiangwan Road Swimming Pool Remains Open</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the swimming pool on North Sichuan Road will not be open this summer. Only the open-air swimming pool on Jiangwan Road will be available for public swimming. However, the Municipal Council will soon build a new swimming pool in the Tilanqiao area, but it is unlikely to be completed and opened this summer. The Municipal Council discussed the swimming pool case at a board meeting the other day. The Chief of the Health Department suggested temporarily retaining the pool for the exclusive use of students from various Municipal Council schools. After consideration by the directors, it was unanimously decided to close the pool and sell the land to fund the construction of a new swimming pool. According to the Chief of the Engineering Department yesterday, the location of the new swimming pool has not yet been selected.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Board of Directors Considers Two Issues</p>
<p>Reducing Rickshaws: The Shanghai Times reported that the Municipal Council Board of Directors recently discussed the issue of reducing the number of rickshaws in the Settlement. This is because the congestion on the roads is largely due to countless empty rickshaws searching for customers in the bustling city, driving east and west aimlessly. Therefore, there was a proposal to reduce the number of rickshaws. After consideration by the directors, it was agreed that reducing the number of licenses or reducing the number of vehicles in the bustling city would greatly help solve the traffic problem. However, as this type of proposal is likely to cause great opposition, it was decided to postpone it temporarily and first seek the opinions of the police's vehicle affairs department and various public transportation companies on the traffic problem before making a decision.</p>
<p>Inspecting Elevators: The Shanghai Times reported that the Municipal Council plans to inspect the elevators of public and private buildings in the Settlement on a regular basis to ensure public safety. They will now ask the Real Estate Owners Association to submit a plan for the inspection in order to gather ideas and benefits, so that both the owners and the public can be satisfied during implementation. The Engineering Committee recently considered the matter and then submitted it to the last Board of Directors meeting. A director stated that the Owners Association is expected to submit some suggestions on building regulations, and it seems appropriate to ask them to submit their opinions on the inspection of elevators as well. It was unanimously approved. Someone then claimed that the Municipal Council's building regulations are based on the powers granted by the Yangjingbang Regulations and cannot be included in the item of equipment and inspection of elevators. For now, the only way is to use Clause 9 of the Yangjingbang Regulations, which regulates good order and good administration, as the basis for inspecting elevators. It was decided to include this section in the agenda of the next Engineering Committee meeting for consideration.</p>

<h3>Record of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Film Inspection Committee</h3>
<p>The Film Inspection Committee of this city held its 38th standing committee meeting at 2:00 PM on April 24th. Chairman Li Dachao reported on the following matters: (1) The Hongkou Theater showed the film "The Dashing Shipowner" without submitting it for inspection. The content of the film contained many insults to Chinese people and our national image. We have now requested all newspapers to remove the theater's advertisements. (2) The Bureau of Education and the Bureau of Social Affairs successively forwarded instructions from the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, ordering the prohibition of the films "The Frightening False Impermanence" and "The Romantic Monk." The film "The Romantic Monk" was produced by the Tianyi Film Company of this city and was submitted to this committee for inspection. At that time, due to the name "The Romantic Monk" being detrimental to public morals, we ordered it to be renamed "The Secret of the Concubine" and all parts of the film involving superstition, debauchery, and violations of laws were cut out before it was approved and returned. Now that the company is still using the original name and has secretly re-inserted the deleted parts, it should be strictly banned.

<h3>The Skilfully Avoided Fan-tan Game Was Cracked Down</h3>
<p>Using Playing Cards Instead of Dice</p>
<p>Using Matchsticks as Chips</p>
<p>A Cantonese man, Wang Hanxiang, recently opened a gambling den on the upper floor of the Lianhe Company at 185 North Sichuan Road, using the Fan-tan game that is popular in his hometown. However, the gambling equipment did not use dice, but instead used playing cards with the numbers "one, two, three, four" written on them, placed face down on the table, for gamblers to bet on. In order to avoid the clanging sound of silver dollars and to prevent banknotes from attracting attention, matchsticks were used as chips. Most of the gamblers were Cantonese sailors and vendors, because people from other provinces do not understand this type of gambling. After being investigated by Detective Wen Youheng of the Hongkou Police Station, he learned that the gambling took place every day after dusk and lasted until dawn. He led a secret raid the night before, and the gamblers were concentrating and excited. Although they wanted to escape, the doors had been blocked, and they were completely arrested. In addition to the owner, there were 27 people in total. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Special District Court, and after being questioned one by one by Judge Luo of the Summary Court, Wang Hanxiang was sentenced to a fine of 200 yuan. If he chose to serve his time, it would be two yuan per day. The gamblers Liang Fu, Liang Xing, Huang Er, Li Cheng, and four others, who were repeat offenders, were each fined 20 yuan. Zhong Xiang and 18 others were each fined 10 yuan. The remaining five people, Zhang Fu and others, did not participate in the gambling and were released without charge. The gambling equipment and foreign money were confiscated.</p>

<h3>Kidnapper from Nanxiang Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wang Jinsheng, a native of Nanxiang, specializes in human trafficking. Recently, he was reported by his sister-in-law, Wang Yang, to the Nanxiang Public Security Bureau. After patrol officer Cui Fengwu and investigation team leader Zhao Fujiang found out that Wang had disappeared into the sea, they came to Shanghai to track him down. The day before yesterday, at dusk, they met Wang on Tongfu Road in western Shanghai, and arrested him. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Special District Local Court, and questioned by Judge Ge. The police lawyer presented two books, saying that they were found on the defendant, and the contents of the books were all in the format of indentures. The defendant committed a case of trafficking a girl in Nanxiang, obtaining 180 yuan. Now the inland government has applied for extradition, and the police have no objection. Wang Jinsheng confessed that he had only committed human trafficking once, and it was at the request of his sister-in-law. Because his sister-in-law had bought a girl as a child bride, who was only 13 years old, and now disliked her for being too dull, she asked me to resell her, fetching 170 yuan. He gave 70 yuan to his sister-in-law, and kept the remaining 100 yuan for himself. His sister-in-law repeatedly demanded it, but he did not return it, so she accused him of human trafficking. After the interrogation, Judge Ge handed the prisoner over to patrol officer Cui to take him back and investigate.</p>

<h3>Two Men Compete for One Woman</h3>
<p>Yao and Song's Sea of Jealousy</p>
<p>Yao Linlang, a native of Chongming, is 31 years old and used to be a cook. His wife, Yang, is 26 years old. Due to poverty at home, she came to Shanghai from her hometown with her luggage in July of last year and stayed at the house of her fellow villager, Fan Zhongguan. After being introduced by acquaintances, she became a female worker in a weaving factory in southern Shanghai, going out early and returning late every day, which became her habit. Fan is 42 years old and lives at No. 73, Zhaojiawan, outside Xiaonanmen. Fan has a son named Song Genlang, who is 36 years old and works as a carpenter. He also lives with his mother, Huang, and his wife at Fan's house. In September of that year, Song's wife suddenly died of illness. Song, feeling lonely without a mistress, saw that Yao Yang was young and beautiful, and could not help but become interested. Therefore, he set his mind to seduce her. Over time, Yang became infatuated with him, and an ambiguous relationship developed. Fearing that the neighbors would gossip, they moved to Xianzhou Lane with Yang and his old mother, hoping to avoid people's eyes and ears. Unexpectedly, before long, the news spread and was learned by Yang's husband, Yao Linlang, who immediately came to Shanghai from his hometown to visit his wife. According to Fan, your wife is now staying at Song Genlang's house in Xianzhou Lane. Yao became more suspicious and immediately went to the address. However, Song had moved elsewhere. When he inquired with the neighbors, they said that Song had moved to No. 239, Chen Gutong Bridge Street, Xiaonanmen. Yao went to the address and met Song. He questioned him about the situation, but Song strongly denied it. Yao had no choice but to leave. Afterwards, Song knew that the rumors outside were not good, so he quickly took Yang to stay at the house of his relative Shi in Lanni Ferry, Pudong, and opened a room in a certain hotel in the Bund to place Yang's luggage, waiting for the rumors to subside, and then planned to elope to another port, so that they could grow old together. Because his wife was missing, Yao searched for her without any news. Therefore, he hired his fellow villager Gong Wenxiang to help him investigate, and gave him 34 yuan for expenses. Gong speculated and guessed that Song had a relationship with her, so he invited several friends to Song's house. After threatening him, Song confessed the truth. Then, on the 17th of this month, Gong went to Lanni Ferry and found Yang, and handed her over to Yao Linlang. Yao was overjoyed to be reunited with his wife and immediately took Gu back to his hometown. The day before yesterday, Yao came to Shanghai alone again and heard that his wife's luggage had been found by Gong, so he came to ask for it back from Gong. Because this matter took a lot of effort and he had paid 108 yuan for expenses, he asked Song to pay it back before handing over the luggage. Yao was suddenly angry that Gong had forcibly detained his luggage, so he grabbed him and found Fan Zhongguan, Song Genlang, Song Huang, and other related people to call the police and took them to the first section of the first district. After a preliminary trial, they were ordered to prepare documents and send them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Use of Electrical Therapy to Steal Huge Sums of Money</h3>
<p>Patients Seeking Medical Treatment Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Introducer Should Be Responsible</p>
<p>Qu Shaoting, a resident of the Northern Zhongzhou Road who came from another province, suffered from foot disease and was unable to walk. His friends Yang Zhicheng and Cai Yijiao and others hired German doctor Willins to come to his home for treatment. After briefly asking about the source of the illness, he said that he did not bring his equipment today and it was inconvenient to perform surgery, and agreed to come again tomorrow. The next day, the German doctor came with the equipment and used electrical therapy to treat Qu. Qu immediately lost his mind and fell into a coma. After a while, he regained consciousness, but the German doctor had already escaped with the equipment. Qu was very suspicious, so he inspected the box. More than 4,380 yuan in banknotes and foreign money were missing. He immediately reported it to the police for tracking. The German doctor Willins and others had already flown away without a trace and could not be traced.</p>
<h3>Kidnapper Song Wusheng Still Detained for Four Years</h3>
<p>The French Police's Request for Retrial Is Not Sufficient</p>
<p>The kidnapper Song Wusheng, last year conspired with a gang to kidnap a four-year-old boy surnamed Chen at No. 2, Huabao Fang, Lagena Road, French Concession. The ransom was unsuccessful and he was discovered and sent to the French Court for interrogation and sentenced to five years of deportation. After being sent to the mainland court for interrogation, Song refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyer Gu Jirong as his representative to request a retrial. After the retrial court's research and trial, the sentence of Song Wusheng was changed to four years of detention and deportation from the concession. Now, because the French police believe that the defendant is a joint offender, they believe that the retrial judgment is inappropriate, so they requested a retrial. Therefore, the French authorities attached great importance to this case, and all the Chinese and Western officials of the French Court attended the trial. They were instructed to consult and pronounce a verdict on whether the French police's request for investigation was appropriate. Yesterday was the date of the verdict. Chinese officials Zhu Qi, Gong Xiang, Tang Zaili, French Consul General Kuna, Du Ge, and Ge Dang still took their seats in the criminal court and pronounced the verdict, stating that the French police's request was not sufficient and ordering the defendant Song Wusheng to continue to execute the retrial judgment.</p>
<h3>The Stolen Child Has Been Found</h3>
<p>Pan Zhenxian, a native of Guanyun County at No. 178, Xiaolong Lane, East of Dayang Bridge, Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, and his deceased wife Ma gave birth to a girl named Xiao Yatou, who is eight years old this year. At 2:30 AM on the 21st of this month, several bandits pried open Pan's gate, two of whom entered the room, each holding a pistol and flashlight, and took Xiao Yatou, who was lying on the bed. When Pan and others chased out, they saw two bandits guarding the door. Afterwards, Pan went to the Taiyang Temple Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau to request tracking. After Zhou District Chief heard the report, he immediately ordered the patrol officers and police to go to investigate, but the bandits had already disappeared like the Yellow Crane. The day before yesterday morning, the investigation team of the district suddenly received a report that Xiao Yatou was hidden in a thatched shed behind Chenjiazhai, 28th Tu, Dachang Township, about three miles northwest of the Hutai Highway Pengpu Branch. The leader Wang Shifu immediately reported it to the District Chief and led more than ten detectives to the thatched shed. They found Xiao Yatou in the thatched shed and arrested He Wanru, who was guarding the house, at the same time. He confessed that the child was left there by Li Laosi, who runs the Longfei Bicycle Shop in East Tu, Pengpu Xinqiao, and his younger brother Laowu. He was selling vegetables at Li's door in the morning, so he knew them, and they gave him two yuan for guarding the child. At that time, he also asked Li and others where the child came from. Li and others said that they had picked her up in the French Concession, because the child's house had collapsed, and they were temporarily taking care of her for a few days. After obtaining the confession, the detectives went to Pengpu Xinqiao and arrested Li. According to his confession, he is 30 years old and a native of Funing. The case was initiated by Zhao Wenfu and a man named Pan San, who live in a thatched shed behind the Dutian Temple, Zhongxing Road. Pan San is a fellow villager of Pan Zhenxian. The detectives went to arrest them again, but the bandits had already escaped upon hearing the news. Later, a group of people was escorted to the Fourth District, where Zhou District Chief questioned them about the situation and ordered them to be temporarily detained pending interrogation by the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3>Detailed Report on the Recent Tragedy in Liu'an</h3>
<p>Jisheng Society Received a Telegram from Zhang Zepu Yesterday</p>
<p>The China Jisheng Society recently received a telegram from Zhang Zepu, Director of the Relief Office in Liu'an, Anhui, stating that the southwestern countryside of Liu'an was the most severely affected area. In places such as Jinjiasai, Liubozhong, Mabu, Dushan, and Nanyue Temple, the number of people who died or were injured and the losses were countless. No fewer than tens of thousands of refugees fled from their homes to other places. About four to five thousand people came to the city begging for food. Beggars were seen everywhere inside and outside the city, which was unbearable to witness. Although the local authorities had set up shelters to accommodate them, it was a drop in the bucket and of no help. Now that Zepu has brought funds to provide relief, everyone is grateful for your society's kindness to the disaster victims. However, Jinzhai, Liubo, Mabu, and Nanyue are still occupied by Mo and cannot be relieved. We have no choice but to consult with the county government and various agencies and distribute your society's continued relief funds of 15,000 yuan to the disaster victims who have fled to the city from the southwestern countryside for relief. The relief funds of 12,000 yuan from the Relief Committee and the provincial government have been agreed to be distributed to the disaster victims in the city and suburbs, and there is no confusion with your society's relief funds. Further reports will be sent later. The society had previously received a telegram from Director Zhang and allocated 15,000 yuan for relief, which was handed over to Mr. You Xilisheng of Luyang Gongzhuang, Wumalu, Shanghai, for collection and exchange. Xiao Ri also received a telegram from Director Zhang stating that the National Army had captured Mabu and other places. The residents and strong men had all fled, leaving only the elderly, weak, women, and children, who were waiting for relief without food. The original relief funds were insufficient for distribution. We ask your society to consider adding more funds so that we can go to the field to provide relief.</p>

It has been recorded in previous reports. The association suddenly saw an advertisement in the advertisement column of the Xin Jiangbei Daily, which was a thank you notice. Xiao Jin, the uncle of Xiao Tong, obtained 200 yuan and requested the court to withdraw the original case and publish a thank you notice. Assuming that it was indeed bribery and reconciliation, the injustice of the deceased Xiao Tong had not been redressed, so they again sent a letter to the Nantong Court, requesting that the parties involved be punished according to law, and that the family of the deceased be properly compensated, so as to maintain the human rights of children and serve as a warning to others. It is heard that the association received the judgment from the Nantong Court yesterday. Excerpts are as follows: "Defendant Cui Guangyuan is sentenced as follows for the case of causing death due to negligence in business, which was prosecuted by the inspector. The main sentence is that Cui Guangyuan is sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for the crime of causing death due to negligence in business. (The facts are omitted) Reasons (omitted above) According to the victim Xiao Liansheng, who was only 13 years old, the place where the car was driving was on a straight road. On that day, Xiao Liansheng and other children were walking on the side of the road in front of the car. The defendant should have paid attention to honking the horn and reducing the speed, but he was careless and went straight, causing a major disaster. His negligence is very serious. Based on the above, according to Article 315 of the Criminal Procedure Law and Article 291, Paragraph 2, and Article 64, the first paragraph of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text." After receiving this verdict, the association immediately sent a letter to the court, thanking it for upholding justice and maintaining the human rights of children, so as to warn those who would recklessly disregard children's lives in the future.</p>

Upon hearing the news, we are filled with grief and indignation. Punishing the perpetrators and offering compensation are merely temporary measures of appeasement. Only the abolishment of unequal treaties can eliminate the harm permanently. We hope that all citizens of the country will rise up with determination and urge the government to implement revolutionary diplomacy, abolish consular jurisdiction, reclaim police power in the concessions, and abolish all unequal treaties.

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Mr. Fei Tang's Report</h3>
<p>Summary Translation of the First to Third Sections (2)</p>
<p>The early history of the International Settlement is briefly described, and its evolution is traced, from its humble beginnings in 1843 to its present scale and importance. The number of foreigners in the International Settlement was initially very small, only 175 in 1849, 243 in 1855, and reaching 1,581 in 1876. From then on, it increased daily. As of today, there are 26,965 foreigners in the International Settlement. Including the areas beyond the Settlement roads, there are a total of 36,471 people, representing no less than forty-two nationalities. During the early stages of the Taiping Rebellion, the city of Shanghai was captured, which occurred in 1853. The Chinese people flocked to what is now known as the International Settlement for refuge. As a result, the nature of the Settlement changed. The importance of this change is also mentioned in the report. Initially, there were only about 500 Chinese people in the Settlement, but by this time, the number of Chinese refugees who poured into the Settlement reached 20,000. The number of foreigners in the Settlement was small, and it was not only impossible to keep them out, but also a clear violation of humanitarian principles. Once the Chinese settled in the Settlement, both the Chinese and foreigners benefited. The peace and good order of the area, as well as the opportunities for business and employment, benefited the Chinese. Leasing land to the Chinese refugees or building houses for them to live in, and enabling the Settlement to thrive and develop due to the presence of the Chinese, benefited the foreigners. The report further states that the events of 1853 and 1854 were repeated in 1860 to 1862, and on an even larger scale. At that time, the Taiping Rebellion was active near Shanghai, and civil war broke out, causing refugees to move to what is now known as the International Settlement, estimated at 500,000 people. This estimated number may include those who temporarily resided in the French Concession. Although many Chinese people moved elsewhere after the Taiping Rebellion was defeated in 1864, according to the census of 1870, there were still more than 75,000 Chinese people in what is now known as the International Settlement. Since then, it has gradually increased, reaching nearly one million today. The origin of the current Shanghai Municipal Council is related to the events of 1853 and 1854. The report cites the records of the foreign conference held in the Settlement in 1854 to prove this relationship. When the events occurred, the foreigners held a historically valuable conference to plan the necessary and practical measures to protect the Settlement. The British Consul, Mr. Alcock, also explained his proposal at the meeting, which was to combine the municipal organizational law and the new land regulations to replace the old regulations established by the Shanghai Daotai and the British Consul in 1845. The report continues to state how the events of 1853 and 1854 directly or indirectly created a special doctrine, so that what is now known as the International Settlement, because of its special status, should enjoy the following rights: (1) The right of defense, for the purpose of self-defense, the Settlement has the right to adopt practical measures to resist invasion or attack; (2) The right of armed neutrality, when there is civil war in China, the Settlement has the right to maintain an attitude of armed neutrality; (3) The right to refuse the entry of Chinese armed forces into the Settlement, that is, to require all generals, including those of the Chinese government, to station troops outside the Settlement, whether in peacetime or wartime, to respect its neutrality. In order to exercise the right of defense, the foreigners in the Settlement demanded, according to the common practice of self-defense, that the Settlement should have the right to defend itself against the danger of external attacks, and therefore be able to organize and support a standing army (i.e., the Shanghai Volunteer Corps), and when necessary, be able to call upon the naval and land forces of various countries for support. The history of the Settlement shows that there have been several times in the past when the two armies were engaged in battle near the Settlement, resulting in danger, which was averted by the rights of defense and armed neutrality.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 traces the history of the Land Regulations. Since the promulgation of the new Land Regulations, agreed upon by the Shanghai Daotai in 1854, these regulations included the organizational law of the Settlement, which was very incomplete. In 1866, the land renters of the Settlement proposed a new Land Regulations, which was approved by the ministers of various countries in Beijing in 1869. Thus, the Settlement began to have an administrative organ like the current one. The Land Regulations of 1869 have been repeatedly attempted to be modified, but without the approval of the ministers of various countries in Beijing and the Chinese government, no agreement has been reached. As a result, the International Settlement today is still largely governed by the Land Regulations of 1866. The general situation of the International Settlement is described as follows: Today's International Settlement is, in fact, still governed by the organizational law established in 1866. At that time, the area of the Settlement was less than one-third of today's area, with about 2,200 foreigners and about 90,000 Chinese people. Today, the number of foreigners has increased to 26,965, and the number of Chinese people has reached 971,397. Even its detailed rules have been modified very little since 1866. Two items were amended in 1898, and then five or six items were amended again. However, because the organs needed to establish new detailed rules are not flexible, and the number of related governments is large, the procedures for amending the detailed rules are often difficult and uncertain. As mentioned below, it is no wonder that the current system of governance and detailed rules cannot enable the Municipal Council and the taxpayers to handle the new situation that has greatly developed in the past sixty years with ease. However, this system of governance was originally established to meet the needs of the society at that time. The size and nature of the society at that time are very different from the current society, which has evolved over so many years. However, it can still achieve so much, which can be said to be commendable. Chapter 4 briefly explains two points: (1) The organizational law included in the Land Regulations, which was approved in 1869, has several clauses that have been modified and are still in effect; (2) The principles on which the organizational law is based are two: autonomy and the rule of law. These two principles are the characteristics of a free system, which have been established in the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries that have accepted the same political ideals, and are briefly discussed separately below. (1) Autonomy. The governance of the International Settlement is based on the will of the qualified voters. This will is expressed through the public meetings of the voters or the Municipal Council. The Council is an administrative organ composed of representatives elected by the voters, and its exercise of its powers on behalf of the voters must be accountable to the voters. (2) Rule of Law. The Municipal Council is only an organ created according to the organizational law, and is not an arbitrary official with vast and unlimited powers. The governing powers granted to the Municipal Council are stipulated in the written organizational law, which the Council itself has no power to change, and its exercise of its powers must comply with the conditions listed in the organizational law. The court is independent of the Municipal Council's powers, but the Council must be completely subject to the court's control. If the Municipal Council has any complaints against any individual resident or any property owner, it must go through the appropriate court before it can enforce its demands. If any individual suffers damage due to the Municipal Council's exercise of its powers, and lodges a complaint with the specially established court, the Municipal Council cannot ignore it. The following sections specifically discuss the various problems that have arisen in the International Settlement from the implementation of the organizational law based on these two principles. In a small number of foreign societies, most of whom are British and American merchants, such as those residing in the Shanghai International Settlement, there is nothing strange in adopting these two principles as the basis for organizing a municipal plan to meet their needs. These people were forced by circumstances to adopt a plan for organizing a municipal government, so that they could act in unison to achieve their common goals. Therefore, in 1854, they first took a measure that was slightly similar to the model they were accustomed to in their own country. In 1866, it was refined and improved. The situation at that time was not only unseen by these people, but also unique. It is remarkable that they were able to work hard to implement their accustomed organization under this situation. Under this kind of organization, a small number of Western merchant groups not only had to provide for the limited municipal needs, but also had to bear the major responsibility for managing and protecting the Chinese people who were increasingly living in the International Settlement. Therefore, while the Chinese people in the International Settlement could increase the prosperity of the Settlement, they also complicated the problems of the Settlement, and the scale of administration was extraordinarily expanded. Over time, the Municipal Council elected by a small number of foreign merchants carried out its police and administrative duties in one of the most densely populated and prosperous parts of the great city in the East, and the Western taxpayers who enjoyed municipal privileges were only a small part of the entire residents of the Settlement. Then, how should the principles included in the organizational law established by the foreigners be applied to the Chinese people? What kind of necessary measures should be adopted so that the Municipal Council can effectively exercise its powers over the Chinese people in the Settlement? What is the relationship between the Municipal Council and the Chinese government outside the Settlement? Due to the needs of the situation, it is inevitable that there must be a form of cooperative management in the municipal system for the Chinese and foreign residents in the Settlement. But what will be the conditions for cooperation? What standards will be used to weigh the relative rights and obligations of each part of the Settlement's resident groups regarding municipal taxation and the benefits they should share from the municipal affairs? All of these are problems involved in the unique situation that has been created. The truth of each of these problems cannot be predicted, and can only be gradually revealed after considerable experience. The progress in solving these problems is slow and difficult, and the main reason for the obstacles is complexity. It can be seen from this that although progress has been made in the past, it has not yet reached the end, and the process is still far from complete. Therefore, in order to understand the current situation and predict the future, it is necessary to trace the more important periods in the meantime. See the following three chapters for details.</p>
<p>Chapters 5 and 6 discuss how the two principles of autonomy and the rule of law included in the organizational law have been implemented among the Chinese people in the International Settlement. Chapter 5 specifically discusses the rule of law, stating that the difficulties that have arisen between the Municipal Council and the Chinese government in various periods are fundamentally due to the completely opposite principles of governance on both sides. One side represents an autocratic system, and the other side represents a system of the rule of law. The Municipal Council of the International Settlement exercises its limited powers as stipulated by the organizational law, and must be subject to the control of an independent court. As for the Chinese government, represented by the local Chinese officials (i.e., the Daotai), the powers it exercises are autocratic in nature, and are not restricted by any stipulated laws, and are not subject to court control, but rather control the court. This is how the powers of the Municipal Council are contrary to the powers of the Chinese authorities. Unlimited autocratic powers and limited statutory powers cannot coexist, nor can they be exercised by two independent organs in the same area for the same society. It is inevitable that the former will swallow or destroy the latter. If the Municipal Council of the International Settlement wants to effectively govern the Chinese people in the Settlement and collect taxes from them, it must insist on restricting the Chinese government's power over the Chinese people in the Settlement. The Municipal Council seems to have long recognized that this is a matter of life and death, not only regarding the welfare of the Chinese people in the Settlement and the prosperity of the Settlement, but also related to the survival of the entire system of governance of the Settlement.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: According to my client, Fan Quangen, he read today's "Shen Bao," which contained a news item about a prostitute committing suicide out of shame, which stated, "Duan A'er, a prostitute from House No. 321, Huile Lane, committed suicide by secretly taking opium because a client named Fan Quangen said she was not a virgin and refused to pay the fee for the night." I was very surprised. I, the undersigned, am by nature quiet and do not like to engage in lewd activities. Only when entertaining friends do I occasionally set foot in such places. Although I have met the prostitute Duan A'er once, there is no ambiguous relationship between us. As for her committing suicide by taking poison, it has even less to do with me. The report in the newspaper must be based on inaccurate information. This matter concerns my reputation. Please send a letter on my behalf to correct this. I respectfully submit this letter to you, Mr. Editor of the "Shen Bao." Yours sincerely, Lawyers Wang Jishi and Gu Hanli, April 25th.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Well of Lord Hu of Mile</h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>In the Shanghai municipal election for the National Assembly representatives, Hu Shuhua received the most votes from the universities and free professional groups. Hu is from You County, Hunan. His brief biography has been disclosed in various newspapers. What I am talking about now is the fact that his father threw himself into a well and died for the Qing Dynasty in the year of Xinhai, so that the world would know that the descendants of loyal and virtuous people are different from ordinary people.</p>
<p>Shuhua's father, whose courtesy name was Qiongsheng, was a Juren in the year of Jiawu, and was selected in the Kui Mao year as a candidate for magistrate and dispatched to Yunnan. In the Yi Si year, he was appointed as the acting magistrate of Zhan Yi County. Within a month, he handled more than a hundred accumulated lawsuits, and his reputation for good governance spread. At the end of the year, he was ranked first among the magistrates of Qujing. In the Ding Wei year, he was appointed as the acting magistrate of Mile County. There were accumulated bandits in twenty-eight villages. Eight magistrates changed in three years, but they could not be governed. When Qiongsheng arrived, he told the garrison general, "Please send troops to capture them. The bandits will be prepared if you announce it. If we go unexpectedly now, we can break through and capture them. I will go first, and you will follow." He wore military uniform and a sword, and attacked at night, capturing Kuang Guozhi. Then, he successively captured and killed Lei Zhen, Zhang Chao'an, etc. All the bandits in the county were cleared. He ordered them to return the two hundred copper coins they had taken from the people and had the clerks flogged. The clerks, a thousand of them, hesitated and then left. In the year of Wu Shen, there was a great flood, and he exempted taxes and provided relief. He remained in office for five years and was rewarded for his good governance. He was appointed as the magistrate of Jiangchuan. In the year of Xin Hai, he was promoted to the position of assistant department magistrate of Daguan, and his hard work was recognized with the use of a prefect. In September, the Yunnan uprising broke out, and the governor of Yunnan fled. Qiongsheng first asked for sick leave three times, but it was not granted. He then asked to return home to repair the grave. After he got a replacement, he sent his family ahead of him. He wrote a letter to Shuhua, saying, "I will leave office on the tenth day of the ninth month. I heard that the walls of Yunnan were lost the night before last, and the magistrate Shi was killed. No one else died for the dynasty. The loyalty of subjects will shine forever. Although I do not have the responsibility of defending the territory, I am still an official. I will wait for news from the north and die to show my loyalty. You do not need to come," and so on. After sending the letter, on the thirteenth day, he falsely claimed that the capital had fallen, and ordered his followers to prepare luggage, scheduling to leave the next day. At dawn, the water carriers saw a pair of shoes on the well and told the adjutant, who ordered them to be searched for. Qiongsheng was already dead in the well. He was fifty years old. Three letters were found on the desk, endorsed with the words "suicide by hanging failed, and then drowned in the well." The letters briefly stated that the capital had fallen and that he would die to show his loyalty. Then the adjutant Yang Zongxi coffined and buried him. At that time, Shuhua was studying at the Beijing Translation School as an assistant student. In June of the first year of the Republic of China, he returned to You County with the coffin. The people of Mile asked to seal the East Well and named it Hu Gong Well. Hunan people who were traveling in Yunnan wrote an article to praise it and asked Wang Xiangqi to write an inscription for the well and carve it in stone, so as not to forget it.</p>
<h3>A Record of Old Woman Wang of Nanhui County</h3>
<p>— Gu Zhizhou</p>
<p>The art of combat is a special strength of our people. It not only benefits the body, but also can be used to defend against enemies. Since the invention of guns and cannons in the West, the literati and officials have considered it insignificant. Therefore, the art of combat has declined, but a few peasant women and men have stubbornly guarded it and not lost it. My friend, Mr. Chen Jingzuo, is from Nanhui. He said that his neighbor, Old Woman Wang, is skilled in combat. She is now eighty years old and can still work hard and is in good health. When Mr. Chen was young, he personally saw her wearing nail shoes and walking dozens of times around the mouth of a giant seven-stone jar, as fast as a flying bird and as light as willow catkins. The old woman was poor and widowed early, and she made spirit money to support herself. Once, a wandering monk came to a certain temple. He was strong and violent, and people feared him and did not dare to resist him. The monk became more and more arrogant. One day, he went to the old woman's place to buy spirit money and forced her to sell it at a low price. The old woman refused. The monk saw a spinning wheel nearby, weighing dozens of pounds, and lifted it up with one hand and threw it in front of the old woman, wanting to crush her spirit money to intimidate her. The old woman waited until it was about to land, and raised two fingers to catch it and put it on the ground. The monk was very angry and destroyed her windows. He turned around and went outside. The old woman said to him, "You are a monk and do not abide by the rules of purity. You are more violent than bandits. Now you come to provoke me. Don't think that the old woman has no way to restrain you." After saying that, she jumped up, more than ten feet off the ground, over the monk's head, and stepped on his shoulders with both feet. The monk immediately fell down, his eyes staring straight ahead, unable to speak, and unable to move his body. Neighbors and passers-by gathered around, and after inquiring about the situation, they all said that it was right to punish him, but if she put him to death, it might not be good. The old woman thought it was true, so she raised her right foot and stepped on the monk's buttocks, saying, "Go." The monk immediately woke up and fled like a rat. The next day, people went to the temple to inquire, but he was gone. The old woman's father was also famous for his combat skills. When the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom army arrived in Nanhui, the old woman's father fought them and always won. The entire village relied on him for safety. Even now, the elders can still tell one or two stories about his deeds. However, Mr. Chen could not remember his name. The old woman's skill in combat was learned from her family.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Antiques and Treasures of a Certain Great House</h3>
<p>— Liu Huogong</p>
<p>In Chongqing Lane, South Chengdu Road, there is a grand mansion. From the outside, it looks like an ordinary building. But upon entering, one immediately feels its splendor and spaciousness, not unlike a royal palace. It was once the residence of a prominent figure from the late Qing Dynasty. This figure, along with his grandfather and father, were all high-ranking officials and received many imperial treasures as gifts. Adding to this the collections accumulated over generations, one finds a vast ocean of exquisite objects, a beauty that surpasses description. Recently, weary of the noise and bustle of Shanghai, they returned with their family. As the treasures were numerous, it was inconvenient to transport them all. Therefore, they entrusted the Sanfa Foreign Firm to auction them off. I heard of this and, feeling it a pity, took time out from my busy schedule to visit. I will now record the essential items I saw, to inform those in the world who care about famous and precious antiques and treasures.</p>
<p>The first thing that caught my eye was a Northern Wei Dynasty stone tablet, about six feet tall. In front, there was a carved image of Buddha, and behind, an inscription. Its ancient and elegant appearance was truly enchanting. Accompanying it were iron and stone statues from the Tang Dynasty, stone lions and gilded lions from the Ming Dynasty, iron tigers and horses from the Yuan Dynasty, a glazed red flower vat from the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, and a famille rose goldfish vat from the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. All were exquisitely made, dazzling the eye. These treasures were all displayed in the courtyard. Entering the hall, one sees a central hall of rosewood inlaid with burl wood and marble, hanging screens, floor screens, and rosewood inlaid with precious jade as surrounding screens. There were also chicken-wing wood tables for eight immortals and a zither stand, rosewood and burl wood master chairs, natural root tables, offering tables, and tables for harmonious union. Furthermore, there were two coral trees, one red and one white, both about two feet tall, truly rare treasures. The paintings of Huang Shigong, Lu Lianfu, and Yun Bing, and the calligraphy of Wang Yangming, Weng Tanxi, Weng Songchan, and Qian Nanyuan were all authentic works, also extremely hard to come by. Other items included a palace-used rosewood clock with inlaid wire, jade pendants from the Han Dynasty, white jade ruyi scepters, a pen holder made from thousand-year-old boxwood root, rhinoceros horns, ivory figures of the Eight Immortals carved by famous artists, round table screens, Nanjing brocade table carpets, and red satin gold-embroidered table skirts from the Qing palace, all rarely seen outside the palace.</p>
<p>Another room displayed silk carpets from the Qianlong period, a gold thread table carpet used in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, a full set of ivory plaques carved with figures from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars, large surrounding and hanging screens of the Hundred Children, rosewood inlaid with burl wood master chairs, writing desks, a white jade Tongtian incense burner, a large jadeite boat, libation cups, water containers, crystal Guanyin statues, mandarin ducks, beasts, agate elephants and birds, vases of green cloud in pots, amber incense burners, flower vases, Kangxi kiln black ground wucai (five-color) Buddha statues, monochrome vases, blue and white porcelain vases, famille rose flower pots from the Qianlong period, porcelain jars, bowls, hanging pots, Guanyin and lions from the Jian kiln, flower vases from the Yao kiln, incense burners from the Jun kiln, bowls from the Ding kiln, ancient bronze tripods and mirrors from the Three Dynasties, flower vases, gilded Buddha statues, ancient ink, carved ivory small pieces, Xiangnan playthings, etc., a dazzling array of countless items. As for the furnishings of each bedroom, there was a distinction between Chinese and Western styles. The Chinese style furnishings were all made of burl wood, rosewood, or rosewood, while the Western style furnishings were all French-style, extremely high-quality imported furniture. In all shapes and colors, exquisitely crafted beyond compare. I am unable to name them all. I only feel that it is a great pity that the collections of this house for several generations are now being sold off at auction. I have heard that these treasures are available for public viewing today, and that they will be auctioned publicly on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Photography of the Internal Human Body</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing images of the internal human body, we only know about X-rays. However, according to overseas news, most modern hospitals are now equipped with new and unusual methods. The procedure is simple: swallow a camera into the patient's abdomen.</p>
<p>Inserting a camera into a patient's abdomen – this is hardly something that most people can believe. In fact, the so-called camera is only the size of a very small pill. Each time, the patient swallows several, or even a dozen.</p>
<p>Let us assume that this type of medical camera used for swallowing is newly named a "photography pill." The pill was invented by two young Austrian scientists. They soon brought it to England, where it was tested with excellent results. The device is tube-shaped, with a small, needle-like hole at each end, and a photographic film. Inside the tube, there is also a small mechanism that emits a strong light for one-hundred-and-twentieth of a second, allowing images to be recorded on the film.</p>
<p>After the patient swallows several photography pills, they must immediately be moved to a magnetic field to avoid physical discomfort. The magnetic field also allows the pills inside the abdomen to begin taking pictures instantaneously. Once the objective is achieved, the pills are gradually excreted from the abdomen. Then, the tiny film is enlarged sufficiently to reveal the hidden details of the internal organs. The cause of the illness can then be found by following the map. This method is extremely unusual. Perhaps it will be seen as an ideal, but Western magazines have written about it with certainty. It must be more than just unsubstantiated hearsay. Therefore, I have translated it as supplementary material for this column.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Origins of Mr. Huan Shang in the Party and the Nation</h3>
<p>— Yu Yi</p>
<p>My late teacher, Mr. Huan Shang, was renowned throughout the world for his calligraphy, poetry, and prose. However, people only saw him as a famous scholar. Some even disparaged him because of Xiangcheng, which my late teacher would have found offensive. Little did they know that my teacher harbored great ambitions from a young age, with a sincere desire to set the world aright. In particular, he had early connections with the Party and the Nation. During the discussion of Hongxian, Xiangcheng was misled by those around him. My teacher was the only one who vehemently remonstrated against it. This is something that many outsiders do not know. Now, my teacher is gone. His talents were never fully realized, and his true intentions were never understood. If there is no eulogy, how can his hidden brilliance be revealed and his latent virtues be made manifest? I, in my inadequacy, will respectfully record what I know of the major events. My limited knowledge and understanding make me ashamed of the superficiality. My hands tremble, my heart aches, and I cannot form words. My eyes are dry, my tears are exhausted, and I cannot write a proper text. The Western philosopher Aristotle said, "I love my teacher, but I love truth even more." This is all I can do in my humble capacity. I hope that the gentlemen of the world will consider this.</p>
<p>During the late Qing Dynasty, revolutionary thought flourished. My teacher joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) very early, at the age of seventeen. Xiangcheng had just been dismissed from his post and returned home. One day, someone secretly informed on my teacher and, after secretly investigating, found letters and membership certificates sent from Tokyo, Japan. Xiangcheng, convinced, gently advised my teacher, "If you are like this, you will destroy our family." He burned everything to destroy the evidence and sent my teacher to the capital. However, my teacher's revolutionary spirit never diminished. In the early years of the Republic, my teacher traveled south and became acquainted with revolutionary heroes. He was particularly close to the martyr Mr. Song Yufu, with whom he had a deep connection. When Xiangcheng heard of this, he summoned Mr. Song for a day-long discussion. He greatly admired Mr. Song's talent and intended to give him important responsibilities, but Zhao Bingjun obstructed it. When Mr. Song was assassinated, my teacher cried out in grief. The civil party and Xiangcheng grew even deeper in their enmity. This led to their defeat, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>When the movement to restore the monarchy arose, my teacher believed that since the form of government was already established, it should not be changed frequently, as it would only disturb the people and would not win the hearts of the people. He repeatedly tried to dissuade Xiangcheng, but was not heeded. He then wrote poems to satirize the situation. Those who were jealous of him slandered him before Xiangcheng. My teacher fled to Shanghai, where he indulged in poetry and wine, not caring about the situation. Secret agents, with photographs, were ordered to arrest him and kill him without mercy. It was almost impossible to escape the law at that time, which shows how dangerous it was.</p>
<p>In the spring of the sixteenth year, my teacher traveled south and passed through Lixia. Zhang Zongchang held a banquet to welcome him and treated him with great respect. Before his departure, Zhang offered generous gifts and sent a messenger to request that he write articles opposing the National Revolutionary Army. My teacher smiled and declined, saying, "How can I go against the will of the people and prolong the power of the warlords?" He refused and left for the south the next day.</p>
<p>After the National Revolutionary Army pacified the Southeast, a performance was held at the New Stage in Shanghai to comfort the soldiers at the front. My teacher was invited to participate. Although he was trying to quit his addiction and was suffering from hemorrhoids, he still exerted himself and performed two scenes from the Kunqu opera "The Little Banquet and The Alarming Change." The audience cheered wildly. All of this shows my teacher's enthusiasm for the Party and the Nation.</p>
<p>Elegy for My Sworn Brother Yuan Hanyun - Written by Shou Juan</p>
<p>For ten years, we met like strangers who instantly became friends, your deep affection for me like siblings.</p>
<p>Where can I summon your soul from a thousand miles away? I weep for you with a broken heart and tearless eyes.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from India (33)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The Bodhi tree, known as the Peepul tree in India, is said to be the tree under which the Buddha sat in meditation for six years and attained enlightenment. This tree is found everywhere in India, with its thick foliage providing shade and helping people to meditate. The great Englishman, Clive, also sat under this tree, meditating on the art of ruling India, and achieved success. In the past, before commercial ports were developed, these trees were especially common in small villages and towns. Clive often sat in a chair under this tree, smoking and meeting people. However, these historical sites are no longer visible, having been converted into markets. He was good at socializing and skillful in interacting with people, often contacting people in the reception rooms and playgrounds of various trading companies.</p>
<p>When the British first arrived, they supported the Indians' faith and showed sympathy by paying their respects to the gods at the appropriate times. The most famous Indian god is Kali, a goddess. Indians call temples "Ghita." Initially, they managed all their business from the temples of the goddess in Indian villages. Combining the name of the goddess's temple, they called it "Kali Ghita." The city of Kali Ghita originated from the name of a goddess's temple, which was easy to remember.</p>
<p>Opportunity is the mother of all things. Internal strife broke out in India, with various factions competing with each other. Trading companies raised funds for self-defense and trained Indian soldiers to quell the Indian unrest. In 1686, Clive first demonstrated his command of both commercial and military warfare, but the result was a failure, as he was unable to occupy Kali Ghita. He retreated to a southwestern Indian region, now the famous port of Madras Province. Madras However, he continued to struggle, as persistence is the key to success. Four years later, Clive built the English government in Nemtolla, a place whose name was also derived from a temple, the Temple of Light. This was the foundation for the subsequent rule of all of India. Unfortunately, heaven did not favor him. Three years after Clive established the English government in India, he was summoned by God. After death, he was buried next to St. John's Church.</p>
<p>The love or marriage between the great man Clive and an Indian woman has been widely studied, but remains unclear. In India, there is a strange custom: when a husband dies, the woman not only remains a widow, but also burns herself to death on her husband's grave. When this ritual is performed, the widow either gathers the firewood herself, or her children help her gather it to burn their mother. People generally admire this as meritorious and do not prohibit it. Clive once saved a widow from being burned alive. The widow was very beautiful and grateful for his kindness. The two then became husband and wife and had two daughters. Their sons-in-law were famous figures and built a large tomb for Clive. However, Clive's wife died several years after giving birth to her daughters, and Clive missed her so much that he never remarried. He even slaughtered chickens as a sacrifice at her tomb. This practice of sacrificing animals is strictly forbidden in Hinduism, but Clive did not care. However, although this story is clear, some people doubt it, saying that the British had little power when they first arrived in India, and Clive might not have dared to do such a thing.</p>

<p>The Gold Market is Extremely Strong</p>
<p>Concluding with an Additional Increase of Five Taels. Yesterday, the 25th, the trend of the gold market was robust and stable. During the morning, the difference between the highs and lows was only about six taels, hovering between 741-42 taels and 45 taels. In the end, it continued to rise by five taels. Market confidence remained firm, with large investors actively purchasing. Overseas silver markets reported lower prices, leading to a higher opening. The price once again exceeded the 740 taels mark, fluctuating by about two to three taels afterwards. This was likely due to the slight tightening of foreign exchange. At noon, as the exchange rates seemed to ease, and firms like Zhifeng Yong and others appeared to be selling, the price experienced a setback, briefly breaking below 40 taels. However, it eventually recovered. It is expected that the price will continue to fall this morning. In the afternoon, as it was the weekend, the market closed as usual. Over the course of this week, the price has rebounded significantly, rising from a low of 699 taels to a high of 746 taels, a difference of 47 taels. Overall, the market has risen by 34 taels.</p>
<p>Hovering Outside 740 Taels. The market opened seven taels higher at 742.5 taels in the early morning of June. Large contracts were reduced by one-sixteenth, and the silver price fell by three-eighths of a cent. Private telegrams also reflected this trend, with Hengyu, Hengxing, and others already buying in. Subsequently, due to sales by the Dalian Gang (a group of traders from Dalian), the price dropped to 41 taels. Shortly after, Fuxing, Yongxin, Hengyi, Yu, and others bought in, pushing the price up by four taels to 45 taels. Zhifeng Yong and others were hesitant to sell, causing the price to fall by another four or five taels. As various firms were settling in British gold, Yuli, Mitsui, and others sold June contracts at 1.3375, initially announcing a price of 40 taels and two cents. The listed rate was reduced by 0.125, the U.S. dollar by 2.5 cents, and the Japanese yen by 1.25 cents, causing the price to rise by another two taels. Retail investors then sold, pushing the price down by more than one tael. After 9:50 a.m., Senchang Yong, Dadecheng, Cuichang Yong, Qianchang Xiang, and others began to buy in, causing the price to jump by 4.5 taels in an instant, reaching 46 taels around 10:00 a.m. However, the exchange market did not change. Later, Wupin Taotou (commodity arbitrageurs), Hongli, and others sold, causing the price to fall by three taels, with fluctuations of only one or two taels. At 10:45 a.m., the price was 42 taels and eight cents. Hengxing, Yuan Lu, and Yongfeng bought in, causing the price to rise to 45 taels in an instant. Subsequently, the Dalian Gang and arbitrage firms sold in succession, causing the price to weaken further after 11:00 a.m., falling by four or five taels. Mitsui and others also sold British gold at 4.375, and banks transacted U.S. dollars at 31.25. Zhifeng Yong entered the market to sell, and at 11:53 a.m., the price finally broke below 40 taels, reaching only 39 taels and five cents. Suddenly, Qianchang Xiang and others came in to buy, pushing the price back up to 41 taels and two or three cents. Near the closing bell, retail investors sold, causing the price to fall back to 40 taels. At noon closing, the price was 40 taels and eight cents, an increase of 5.3 taels compared to the previous day, returning to around 41 taels. The highest price for the half-day was 46 taels, and the lowest price was 39 taels and five cents, a difference of 6.5 taels. The opening price for goods was 1.5 taels, and the closing price was 1 tael. The announced price was changed to 777 taels, a reduction of 36-37 taels to 31 taels. The noon closing price was 36 taels, with 39 taels and 41 taels registered for May and June, respectively, and 35 taels for the makeup water.</p>
<p>Trading Volume Was Not Significant. According to statistics on transactions among dealers, there were no large volumes. However, the buyers seemed to outnumber the sellers. Changsheng Yong, Qianchang Xiang, Xinheng, Fuxing Yong, Cuichang Yong, Hengxing, Senchang Yong, Hengxing Yuan, Yuantai, and others bought in, while Wanxing, Tong Taichang, Zhifeng Yong, Shunli, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Chengfeng Yong, Dadecheng, and others sold. Speculators Wu Lu and others bought in. Hengyu, Fuyu, Futaiheng, Yuan Da Yong, Zhenchang Xiang, and others traded occasionally. The Dalian Gang sold a total of more than 2,000 taels and bought in more than 1,000 taels, with the previous long positions being largely squared off. The Guang Gang only bought in four or five hundred taels.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Exchange Market Remained Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British, American, and Indian silver prices fell again, while exchange rates experienced slight fluctuations. As a result, the exchange rate listed by HSBC was reduced by half a point, with British gold at 1.25, calculated at one shilling and three pence and one-eighth of a penny; the U.S. dollar at 2.5, calculated at 30.0625 yuan; the Indian rupee at 0.75, calculated at 84.75 rupees; the French franc at seven yuan, calculated at 783 yuan; the Belgian exchange at 1.25, calculated at 128 marks and five; the Dutch exchange at 0.75, calculated at 76.25 guilders; the Singapore exchange increased by 1.5 taels, calculated at 183.5 taels; and the Japanese yen increased by one point, calculated at 1.6125 taels. Hong Kong remained at 78.5 taels. The price of bank transactions was firm from the morning, then remained flat. The price seemed to ease at noon, likely due to the gold market reversing its gains. However, the final result was a reduction of 0.0625 for British gold, a reduction of 0.125 for the U.S. dollar, and an increase of 0.25 for the Japanese yen compared to the previous day. The arbitrage also felt close, with a difference of only 13-14 taels. Consequently, businesses seized this opportunity to settle again. Fuchang Sheng, Da Yuan, Cheng Yong, and others all settled. About 200,000 pounds of British gold were transacted. Banks were still willing to sell, with Japanese firms selling the most. However, Chinese firms still held short positions, as they had not yet covered them. The U.S. dollar continued to be sold by the Central Bank, with Shanghai Mitsui, Datong, and others absorbing about 400,000-500,000 yuan. While there were transactions in Japanese yen, there was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>

<h3>The Wind of Rising Silver Cents Continues</h3>
<p>Reaching a New High Price of 7 Cents and 3 Fens... Opening the New High Price of This Geng Day.</p>
<p>It was predicted that there would be a wave of rising silver cents, but the timing was uncertain. From Thursday and Friday of this week, the price gradually increased, and yesterday it reached 7 cents and 3 fens. Although not a violent surge, it was an accumulation of small increases. The upward trend is just beginning. According to recent short-term observations, there are signs of an increase of two or three lis.

The copper cash rate was raised by 1,000 to 370,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver and Cash Inflow and Outflow. (Silver Notes) Yesterday was Saturday, and banks had their usual afternoon holiday, so the receipt and payment were relatively simple.

<h3>Long-Term Inflow and Outflow as Chaotic as Hemp</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 25th comparison date, most long-term deliveries and various plans for receivables and payments had to be determined. In particular, the Ningbo banks (甬莊) acting as agents had many lending accounts, with complicated procedures and huge amounts, so the disbursement was particularly chaotic. The final assessment estimated that the total amount of Ningbo funds was more than 10 million, and the Shanghai funds totaled more than 30 million. As for the long-term fixed deposit transfers, there were also more than 10 million, and the new inflows and withdrawals also totaled 4 to 5 million. The short-term funds made by Chinese banks acting as agents for the transfer of property mortgages and loans to money shops were even larger.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Prices Rose Slightly Compared to Before</h3>
<p>Yesterday, only the 19 Customs and Disarmament bonds had some transactions in the spot market. The futures market was generally good in the morning, but quieter in the afternoon. The trend of bond prices was slightly higher than the previous day, with stronger demand in the market. However, apart from the larger increase in the spot price of Disarmament bonds and the April futures price of the Seven-Year Bonds, the others only changed by one or two jiaos. The total transaction volume for the whole day was only 5,000 yuan, and the total futures volume was more than 6.3 million, with the Twenty-Year, Disarmament, and Reorganization Bonds, the 19 Charity Bonds, the 19 Customs Bonds being relatively active, it was said.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Yarn Market Turns Soft in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then fell, but overseas cotton yarn conditions are trending upward, and market sentiment is improving. However, most local opinions are uniformly bearish, the environment is apathetic, and the market remains sluggish. Currently, the Cantonese are more actively buying yarn, while other groups are showing little interest. Speculative yarn from Sichuan and second-tier factories has been heavily shorted. However, Rui Da Hao has sold off a large amount of its long positions, putting pressure on the market, causing the market to turn downward.</p>
<p>Man-made fiber market trends from rising to falling. The man-made fiber market opened higher, with all grades of American cotton rising, leading to tight conditions in the market, with all months rising by 7-8 mace to 1-2 taels. In the afternoon, the man-made fiber market suddenly fell, with Rui Da Hao selling off, causing market weakness, with all months falling by 6-7-8-9 mace to 1-2 taels. Total transactions for the day were 23,400 bales. Rui Da sold 4,050 bales, Da Ji 550 bales, He Shen 450 bales, and Shen Chang 400 bales. Long Feng bought 1,050 bales, Chang Ji 1,500 bales, Geng Feng 1,400 bales, Tong Xing 750 bales, Yong Chang 700 bales, Da Fu 700 bales, and Da Feng 700 bales. The closing prices are recorded below, showing the rise and fall and outstanding balance of man-made fiber closing prices:</p>
<p>April: 1633, up 3, 12,950 outstanding; July: 1649, down 1, 62,050 outstanding; May: 1640, down 2, 45,600 outstanding; August: 1651, up 1, 63,100 outstanding; June: 1644, up 3, 71,600 outstanding; September: 1626, up 1, 21,400 outstanding.</p>
<p>Existing yarn sales are still smooth. Sales of existing yarn are still good. Daily purchases by various groups totaled 1,665 bales, with 530 bales being inter-dealer trades. Market sentiment remains firm. Among out-of-town buyers, Guangdong bought 1,000 bales, inland areas 415 bales, Jinan 50 bales, Sichuan 55 bales, Tianjin 40 bales, and miscellaneous groups 100 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Without Significant Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The cotton market remains firm. Because most bearish American cotton rebounded by over ten pounds, public sentiment has slightly firmed, and the price of gold is difficult to decrease, so merchants' attitudes remain strong, holding firm and unwilling to release. However, the sales of existing cotton are dull, and factory buying is very sluggish, so there are still people selling short. In short, the base stock is too depleted, and if foreign cotton holds firm, there is unlikely to be a significant drop.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard cotton market is stable in the morning, flat in the afternoon. The Hankou Standard cotton market opened higher in the morning, with American cotton trending upward, leading to good sentiment, with each month rising by 1 to 2.5 mace. In the afternoon, due to the sluggish yarn market, prices fell slightly by 0.5 to 1 mace. Transactions totaled 44,200 dan. Yi Yu sold 3,000 dan, Xin Cheng 2,600 dan, Shen Chang 1,700 dan, Rui Da 1,500 dan, Geng Feng 1,100 dan, and Xin Heng 1,000 dan. Tian Long bought 1,000 dan, Yuan De 1,800 dan, Tong Xing 3,400 dan, and Chang Feng 2,600 dan. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Cotton Closing Prices: Rise and Fall, Outstanding Balance: June: 4040, up 20, 157,400 outstanding; April: 3985, down 25, 27,800 outstanding; July: 4020, up 15, 157,900 outstanding; May: 4665, up 10, 113,900 outstanding; August: 4010, up 10, 23,100 outstanding.</p>
<p>Demand for existing cotton is quiet and unheard of. The business for existing cotton is very quiet, with no interest from factory buying. Sources included 110 bales of Yao cotton and 116 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Yarn Market Turns Bullish</h3>

Futures rose 9-12 points, and spot prices rose 10 points. Both British cotton futures and spot prices rose 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 10 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to brokerage selling, but later firmed due to exporter buying and short covering, with Pingguoer and Aomula falling by 1 rupee, and Bailuoxi falling by 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (dated the 24th):</p>

<h3>Last Week's American Cotton Fluctuates</h3>
<p>New York, 24th Telegram Report on the cotton market for the past week: In the past week, the cotton market fluctuated. May futures continued to see long liquidation and shifted to the forward months. There was no news of sales in the South, and the base remained stable. The weather was generally good in the middle of this month, but in the past two days, rain and low temperatures have hindered the progress of the new cotton. It is generally believed that the start of new cotton this year is better than in previous years, but drier weather is needed in mid-May. Market sentiment is generally still bearish, due to the collapse of the stock market, many doubts about acreage reduction, and the rapid progress of new cotton planting and sowing. However, buying by the trade has prevented selling and has prevented the downward trend.</p>

<h3>Grains: Rice Market Rises in the North, Stable in the South</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, over ten boats arrived. However, due to the increased prices of the shipping company, the bagged rice transported by the Xixiang rice mills has been suspended. In addition, the northern japonica rice shipped from the mainland to Shanghai mostly still requires losses, so sellers are unwilling to sell cheaply, and sources are becoming increasingly scarce. The japonica market opened higher in the morning due to the cloudy weather, increasing by a few cents per unit, leveled off slightly at noon, and then rose by about one corner after heavy rain. Sales of thin indica rice are not very smooth, but high-quality goods are quite popular, so prices are slightly firm, especially opening at eleven yuan and three or four corners. High-quality Yangxian rice is active, while medium and lower grades are average. Market prices are high and firm, while medium grades are stable. Duzi Xian and Huxian rice sales are uneven, with sellers more willing to sell, and top-quality goods are especially scarce, so the overall market is stable. Baiyuan is short of high-quality goods, and the market is flat. Shaded and dried goods are rare and popular, and prices are gradually rising by a corner.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, only about ten boats arrived by river. Sales in the market vary. Changsu Baijing, such as special top-quality goods, are getting tighter and tighter, while ordinary and lower grades are all stable and firm, without much increase or decrease. South Shanghai's thin early rice sales are only piecemeal, with little progress. Initially, it was extremely dull, but it turned better in the afternoon due to the rain, resulting in a stable to firm trend. Merchants in Yangdu and various Xian rice varieties are not very willing to buy, and the overall market is stable. Bianyuan's shaded and dried sales are quite brisk, so high-quality goods continue to flourish by one or two corners, and medium grades are also close to a corner.</p>
<h3>Futures Market Initially Weak, Then Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, showed an initial weakness followed by a better trend in all months. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat decreased by about one or two corners, some people tended to wait and see. Then, because Tianjin merchants had some appetite, and there were withdrawals of existing goods, the factories gradually withdrew their preparations, so the market sentiment stabilized as a result. Until several sessions in the afternoon, due to the sudden rain and cold weather, the buying sentiment of inland merchants also surged again, so the increase in the forward months was relatively strong. However, in terms of the overall trend, there is ultimately no hope for excessive gains. As a result, this month was better than the previous day by 5 li, May was better by 1 cent and 2.5 li, June and July were better by 1 cent and 7.5 li, August was better by 1 cent and 2.5 li, and September was better by 1 cent.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Near Weak, Far Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, showed a trend of near falling and far firming for all months. This month's delivery is near, with only one day of trading left. Most parties, except for factories, must return their positions. However, because there were more people releasing goods than receiving goods, the longs were greatly squeezed. This is entirely due to the needs of the market and has nothing to do with gains or losses. However, fortunately, in the last few sessions, Dingtai and others bought in, which was able to maintain the situation. Otherwise, it would not have been surprising to see a drop to 8 qian. The months from June onwards were also flat in the morning. In the afternoon, due to the rain and the firm flour market, sentiment generally picked up. As a result, this month fell by a huge 6 fen compared to the previous day, May fell by 1 fen, June rose by 3 fen, July rose by 4 fen, and August and September rose by 3 fen.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Orchid Seeds Rise Sharply, Then Retreat Slightly</h3>
<p>There have been some recent arrivals of orchid seeds, and inventory in the market is not large. However, because of high prices, sales have decreased, and most transactions are small. Recent quotations have shown a slight retreat, with fluctuations of about two taels from the highest prices. High-quality goods in the market are still difficult to reduce, while the second-grade goods receive very little attention, and prices are relatively cheap.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The First Word on Anhui and Jiangxi Tea</h3>
<p>The Qingming Festival has passed, and the Start of Summer is approaching. Anhui and Jiangxi new teas, which have always been a major export commodity, are once again about to enter the market. Important news about the tea-producing areas is highly anticipated by Chinese and foreign tea merchants. Here are some of the findings, described separately:</p>
<p>Qimen Tea Market's Vigorous Outlook: Qimen black tea has always been famous, and its quality and taste are unparalleled at home and abroad. In recent years, most Anhui merchants engaged in black tea have focused on Qimen. Although black tea in the Shanghai market was sluggish and prices were low last year, sales of Qimen goods were still not bad. Some, due to excessive costs and late boxing, suffered slight losses, but many still made substantial profits, especially the southern firms. This year, many Qimen tea firms that suffered losses last year have moved into the southern area. According to recent surveys, the number of tea firms opening shops in the entire county has not only not decreased but has also increased by as many as 30 compared to last year. It is estimated that 19 new firms have been added in the Tafang area of southern Qimen, and 11 have been added on both sides of the west of the city. There are still several temporarily waiting and watching, and will open for business as needed. The various firms are rushing to transport funds to the tea-producing areas as the new tea is about to be harvested, and they are extremely busy. Personnel from tea companies in various places will also arrive one after another. Its vigorous outlook is actually greater than in previous years.</p>
<p>Fuliang Tea Market Creates Difficult Recoveries: Fuliang is also an important area for black tea production. Last year, there were no fewer than 70 companies and shops in the four rural areas of the county. However, due to high costs and poor manufacturing methods, and old and grassy tea, foreign merchants did not pay much attention to these Fuliang goods. As a result, the selling prices were severely reduced, and the firms closed down and suffered huge losses. Among them, most lost all of their capital. This year, in various Fuliang areas, in addition to Jiangcun, Shigong, Pancun and other places where more than a dozen villages have already opened for business, the rest are finding it difficult to regain momentum due to the serious damage they suffered last year. As of today, not only have the number of black tea companies and shops in the Fuliang area not increased, but they have also decreased by more than 30 compared to the past. Last year, there were a total of nine firms from Wuyuan opening in the mountains. This year, only Shilihe and Jitaixiang from Wuyuan have entered the mountains. In addition, the bandit atmosphere in the neighboring areas has not been quelled. To avoid danger, many people with capital dare not take action. The coldness of the market is rare in the past decade.</p>
<p>Xiuwu Tea Market is Dark and Lifeless: Xiushui and Wuning are the largest black tea producing areas in Jiangxi Province. However, in recent years, they have been repeatedly robbed by bandits, and tea merchants have suffered huge losses. Although this year's new tea is about to be harvested, the number of tea firms in various areas preparing to open shops and handle tea is still very few. The Wuyue and Yingkou groups are all afraid of the unresolved bandit problem and regard it as a dangerous path. Local capitalists have also mostly disappeared and are silent, and no one is paying attention. According to Xun merchants, only one firm from Wuyuan and one from Guangdong are planning to enter the mountains to start operations this year. The rest will wait and see until the time comes. If the bandit problem is not resolved and the mountain prices are not low, then no one will dare to risk the attempt. From this, we can know that the Xiuwu tea market is dark and lifeless this year.</p>
<h3>Metals: British Tinplate Arrives and Sales are Both Strong</h3>
<p>The market for British tinplate is very good recently. Because customer demand is extremely broad, local inventory is not sufficient to meet demand. Although more than three or four thousand boxes have arrived from overseas in the past two days, they have all been purchased by Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and the various groups along the Yangtze River. Therefore, there is a trend of selling as soon as they arrive. The market is short and prices are firm. Currently, the market price is estimated at 16 taels and 2.5 qian per box of 90 pounds, and 16 taels and 7.5 qian per box of 100 pounds. It is said that sentiment is firm, and the market standard is expected to continue to improve.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Fifth Exhibition of the Morning Light Art Society</h3>
<p>— Zeng Xi</p>
<p>In the entire movement of nationalist art, painting is also an important part. This fifth exhibition held by the Morning Light Art Society is a pioneering presentation standing on the ground of nationalism. In all the works, nearly half of them distinctively highlight cutting-edge nationalist colors. Nationalist painting naturally has its clear movement, and this is still a beginning. In terms of theory, Mr. Zhu Yingpeng has published an article "Chinese Painting and Nationalism" in the "Vanguard Monthly," but there have been no other systematic articles. However, Zhu's article has already provided a considerable theoretical foundation, and now there is this nationalist-themed painting exhibition of the Morning Light Art Society. Regardless of whether those works are already mature, this initial pioneering work should be noteworthy in the course of the movement.</p>
<p>Below, I would like to give a brief introduction to some important works—those with cutting-edge nationalist colors—which I think is not entirely meaningless.</p>
<p>(1) Using Myths and Legends as Subjects</p>
<p>Mythology is a good subject for nationalist painting. In the West, it is common to express myths and legends in artworks, such as "Apollo," "Venus," and "Laocoön" in sculpture, and "Faust" and "Paradise Lost" in literature, which are the most common examples. In our country's many ancient myths and legends, there are quite a few that can be used as subjects for nationalist painting, because myths and legends can best express the soul of a nation, especially those primitive myths and ancient legends, which almost completely express a nation's history of growth and struggle, and also most truly and profoundly reveal a nation's character and spirit, and its process of life evolution. Many of our country's myths, in particular, are most suitable for being used as subjects for nationalist painting because they possess the spirit of greatness, passion, and bravery. Such are the following subjects in this exhibition:</p>
<p>(A) "Sun Chariot" (B) "Hou Yi Shooting the Sun" (C) "Nüwa" (D) "Battle of Zhuolu" (E) "Cowherd and Weaver Girl," etc.</p>
<p>The story of the "Sun Chariot" is the same as Apollo in Greek mythology, that is, the god of the sun. The myth of the god of the sun exists in almost all nations of the world. This is a primitive myth, the primitive people's deification of nature, and on this, one can encounter the differences in the original ideas of various nations. For example, we see Caini's goddess of dawn, who in the picture shows the elemental spirit of dawn chasing a goddess of the night, with little angels waving torches in the air, and a group of beautiful goddesses dancing around the goddess of dawn. The goddess of the night flees in front, and then the earth announces the dawn from the sweet sleep of the night. What a beautiful and moving myth! But the sun in our country has a simple and majestic meaning. The god of the sun drives his chariot and scatters the darkness, and then the earth gradually stretches out from the dawn. This comes from a line in Li You's "Nine Songs" of the Han Dynasty—"How can Hercules turn the sun chariot"—although he said it too simply, it is not difficult for us to imagine its meaning, which is a myth with great spirit.</p>
<p>There are several versions of the myth about Nüwa, such as in "Huainanzi," "Records of the Grand Historian," and "Liezi: Tang Wen." The composition here is based on the two sentences in "Huainanzi": "...Nüwa refined five-colored stones to mend the sky,...killed the black dragon to save Jizhou..." The description of this myth is indeed very great, depicting a woman so wonderfully, although it is the humanization of divinity, it can also make us imagine the bravery of our primitive people.</p>
<p>It is certainly very good to use this kind of subject for painting, but it is very difficult in composition and expression.</p>
<p>"Battle of Zhuolu" is indeed a very moving painting, but unfortunately the format is still too small. If it could be larger, I think the author would be able to achieve better success in composition and expression.</p>
<p>This myth of this painting depicts the history of struggle in the primitive era of the nation. Such a glorious historical trace, and it is also a mythical one, that using painting to create it, how cutting-edge nationalist is it? The story about it—the Yellow Emperor conquering Chiyou—can almost be read in elementary school textbooks. The basis of this painting may be from the records in the "Records of the Grand Historian." If it can be based on what is said in the "Classic of Mountains and Seas" and the format is further expanded, then it will be a more beautiful mythical work.</p>
<p>Now what I want to point out is a painting of "Cowherd and Weaver Girl," which uses the most popular folk myth as its subject.</p>
<p>The story of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl is truly the most beautiful of our country's myths. There are also many kinds of writings in ancient books. Here, I will only record the one in the "Nineteen Ancient Poems" to take a look:</p>
<p>"Far away the Cowherd star, bright the Weaver Girl of the Milky Way, slender hands picking white silk, busily working the loom, all day without weaving cloth, tears falling like rain, the Milky Way clear and shallow, how far apart are they, separated by a ripple of water, silently unable to speak,..."</p>
<p>It is also very difficult to get a good composition using this subject for painting. However, the author skillfully composed a very appropriate picture, and the author portrayed the Cowherd and Weaver Girl as two typical beautiful men and beautiful women, which is fully created from the perspective of nationalist consciousness. Nationalist painting is to promote a nation's bravery, upward enthusiasm, and healthy virtues, so with the passionate subject of the Cowherd, and also expressing the healthy beauty of the body.</p>
<p>(2) Using Sports Life as Subjects</p>
<p>The prosperity and soundness of a nation cannot but rely on the sound and strong physique of its people, so it is inevitable to use sports life as subjects in nationalist painting.</p>
<p>From many ancient Western sculptures, we can find the typical examples of those strong and vigorous bodies, such as "Apollo," such as "Discobolus"..., from this, we can firmly believe that Westerners pay attention to sports. The hereditary influence of those ancient Greek statue sculptures on the national physique is very great.</p>
<p>Here, in the Morning Light Art Exhibition, with sports life as the main painting subject, how should we recognize its value?</p>
<p>"The Finish Line" depicts the wonderful postures of several female athletes when they reach the finish line in a race. However, the author used a very earnest attitude to create a very rigorous work, and it is very meaningful in terms of the bright, enthusiastic, and vivid colors, the lively brushstrokes, and the standard beauty of the bodies of the several female athletes depicted.</p>
<p>The most brightly colored and the most briskly brushed painting, "Flying," depicts three swimmers jumping down from a high place and their postures in mid-air. Although in the composition and colors</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>The brushstrokes are very simple, but it gives the viewer a lively feeling. With its simple tones, it gives people a bright impression.</p>
<p>A corner of the football field gives people a very amiable and alluring power in the expression of colors and light, and the healthy and beautiful physique and lively and dynamic postures of the several athletes kicking in the field, and the successful depiction of sunlight, and the appropriate composition, this painting gives us satisfaction.</p>
<p>Here are also several descriptions of high-jumping postures, which have all received good effects in the same way as the previous paintings, in terms of composition, color, and brushstrokes.</p>
<p>(3) Using the Life of the People and Revolutionary Deeds as Subjects</p>
<p>Using the life of the people as the subject matter, this can better express the special colors of the nation. For example, Spanish painters paint bullfights, English painters paint hunting life, etc. However, from the standpoint of nationalism, the description of the life of the people should not only objectively express special colors, but also indicate the improvement of the life of the people and saving the morbid state of society as its important significance. In this exhibition, several paintings such as "Displacement" and "Victims of Disaster"... are like this. "Displacement" and "Victims of Disaster" both depict the tragic side of the life of the people. The emerging painting goes to the center of the people to express the people and to complain about the sufferings of the people.</p>
<p>The depiction of revolutionary life is also the description of the nation's history of struggle, and the fact that "revolution" can give influence to art is also inevitable. Delacroix's "Liberty Leading the People" in the era of the French Revolution is a good example. However, in China, not to mention the past, only from the Revive China Society to the current National Revolution, in the past twenty years, although it has aroused considerable influence on literature and art, there is almost no painting that expresses revolutionary life, which is indeed a regret.</p>
<p>The painting "Meeting in Zhengzhou" depicts the scene when the National Revolutionary Army captured Zhengzhou during the Northern Expedition and then held a military conference in the open air. This is almost a commemorative painting of a revolutionary process. After seeing this painting, what interesting memories should float in my heart?</p>
<p>A painting with the same meaning as this one is "Looking Out." Officers and soldiers are resting on the mounds, using telescopes to look out for traces of the remaining enemy. This is the expression of military life in the revolutionary era.</p>
<p>In depicting the life of the people in the revolutionary era, "Workers' Meeting" and "Awakening" can be representative. From these two paintings, we can savor the fanatic emotions of the people in the tense era of the revolution. The painting "Awakening" depicts the posture of a person standing on a high place next to a street crowd giving a speech. The composition, brushstrokes, and colors can be used very tensely. This is a work that can capture people's emotions. "Workers' Meeting" is purely a description of the mass movement. Several simple workers are holding a meeting. This is completely a new impression of the revolution.</p>
<p>In addition, there are several paintings such as "Mass Meeting" and "Female Propagandist," which can be said to be commemorative works of the climax of the revolution, which will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>(4) Using National Humiliation and Suffering as Subjects</p>
<p>"Expressing the national humiliation and suffering in painting is the most effective way to promote the awakening of national consciousness. The shared tribulations of the past, the suffering suffered by the ancestors, and the sacrifices of the nation, recalled, through the power of painting, poetry, and legends, deeply penetrate into the soul of the nation, arousing the emotion of 'sharing weal and woe,' which has a more profound influence than other expressions. Nationalists who paint about the oppression and humiliation suffered by our nation from foreign races believe that we should first strive for this goal." │ See "Chinese Painting and Nationalism" in the second issue of "Vanguard Monthly."</p>
<p>In this exhibition, the works such as "Impression of Changsha," "Red Terror," and "Racecourse" are practicing the requirements mentioned above.</p>
<p>The above are the brief introductions to the important works in this exhibition. As for the work of evaluation, please ask the viewers to do it. Looking at all the works in this exhibition, in terms of skills, we can admit that it has not failed, and in terms of subjects and content, it has broken the records of all the exhibitions without a position in our country in the past. However, I have two expectations here. First, I hope that those who work hard in the nationalist painting movement can work harder and create new techniques of painting that are suitable for expressing the meaning of nationalism. Second, I hope that our viewers can have a deeper understanding of the nationalist art movement after watching this exhibition.</p>
