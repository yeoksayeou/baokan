<p>在今日靑年羣衆中。吾人隨時隨地可以聽到一片無出路之呼聲。或飲泣。或籲求。或憤激。或絶望而至於鋌而走險以求一洩悲憤者。或更自戕生命以求一了百了者。種種慘痛現象。不一而足。此實爲今日一種極嚴重之社會問題。同時亦即我國家莫可補償之損失。目前正値暑假。國内各中大學校及留外學生。又將有一大批靑年宣告卒業。而踏入社會謀生活。有人譬學校如工廠。。</p>
<p>學生如出品。學生入社會就業。即如出品之求銷售。但今日我國學校。只知生產。不顧銷路因之銷路停滯積貨朽腐。此言之沉痛。實足供吾人深思長慮。雖然。今日靑年果眞無出路乎。吾人敢曰有。特患靑年無創造精神耳。以我國土地之大。物產之衆。東北西北。荒地萬里。急待開發。種種社會事業。急待舉辦。有志靑年。何往而非出路。更何往而不適。若但圖因人成事。不能創造新事業。以充實其新生命。則欲求不爲富貴所淫不爲貧賤所移。不爲威武所屈。終至於悻悻而生。鬰鬰以死者。是何能得。有志靑年。亟應自起創造。癖園地以哥倫布尋新大陸之精神。以魯濱蓀探荒島之勇氣。努力於前途新生命之展開。努力而救。即所以救社會。即所以救國家。亦即所以造福人羣。若徒宛轉呼籲坐待人救。漫漫長夜。眞不知破曉何時。靑年靑年。猛醒猛醒。</p>

<p>目前我國外交上之問題至多。亦至爲重要。如完成法權交涉。進行收回租界。中蘇會議。以及最近之東北中日鐵道協商。無一不爲關係我國收回主權之重大外交問題。有其一者。我國人即竭全力以赴應。猶恐不及。若更淡焉漠焉。反於國内問題。眈眈而視。侃侃而談。一若某種問題。某項事情。急如星火。迫在眉睫。較對外問題尤爲重要者。則内無後盾。外有强國。欲謀外交之順利進行。自更艱難。竊觀歐美各國國家一有外交上之問題發生。則全國人民都以一致之精神。竭力以赴。即婦人孺子、亦互相戒勉。起而參加。非達到勝利之目的不止。反觀我國則果何如。即如本文所論列之此次東北中日鐵道協商。日人朝野。討論研究。主張建設。報紙之宣傳。私人之談論。萬目睽睽。幾報紙之宣傳。私人之談論。萬目睽睽。幾視爲日本今日要政無有比此事之更爲重大者。我國人士固能有日本朝野若是之重視者乎。其實此次協商。以地位言。我國爲被動。以利害言。我國爲被侵略。雖日人此種行爲。爲違背公道。但以舉國一致之行動。以來謀我。則我國爲求收回已失之主權。廢除不平等條約。對此次協商之如何。以赴湯蹈火之精神。十百倍人日謀我之努力。以謀自衛。進而收回主權。此爲國人最有價値之努力。而又尤爲新興國家必不可少之努力也。近年以來。國人亦日言廢除不平等條約。夫欲廢除不平等條約。究應如何而後可以達到。國人應熟思之。如對内不能圑結。對外又復漠視。欲求爭得外交上之勝利。是何可能。故今後國人亟應移重視國内問題之目光。進而注意外交問題。復興我民族精神。提高我國家地位。都在國人一迴念間。固非不可求得者也。</p>
<p>此次東北之鐵道交涉。就性質言。吾人只能認爲中日兩國在東北鐵道事務上之一種實際協商。絶不能認爲兩國之正式交涉。其討論之範圍。亦僅限於兩國鐵道上之實際事務問題。過此即爲越權。蓋國際間正式交涉。必以對手方之中央政府爲對象。此次日本僅照會我東北地方政府。則可知其性質純爲鐵道實際事務上之協商。與此商業公司爲某種事務上問題約同彼商業公司協商之性質同。除事務上實際問題之協商而外。日方代表旣絶不能提出溢出範圍以外之問題。我方代表亦絶無權接受討論。否則都爲越權。國人於言及此次協商時。每每稱爲「中日鐵道交涉」實則就性質範圍言。並非正式交涉。而爲東北中日鐵道實際事務上之一種協商。差之毫釐。失之千里。一時之失。或遂爲日人將來藉口之柄。國人於此點。實應鄭重認淸。</p>
<p>至於日人此次提出交涉之動機。吾人可認爲（一）由於日人侵略東北鐵道政策一貫的實施。（二）由於去秋濱口内閣欲以對外問題消除國内黨爭。從來日人對東北之鐵道政策。約有三端。一爲滿鐵中心政策。二爲大循環政策。三爲複線複港政策。歷年來之明爭暗鬥。無非欲求實現此種陰謀。田中内閣上日皇奏章之對滿蒙積極政策中有云。「···此後必須以軍事爲目的。建設滿蒙大循環綫。而可包圍滿蒙中心地。以制支那之軍事政治經濟等等發達。···」又云「我對滿蒙鐵道急欲實現者。爲（一）通遼熱河間鐵道。（二）洮南至索倫鐵道。（三）長洮鐵道之一部。（四）吉會鐵道。（五）琿春至海林鐵道。」就中以吉會一路。最爲關係我國存亡。故田中又有云「···按此鐵路（吉會鐵道）如成即我新大陸政策之成功。從前欲往歐洲之人。須經大連與海參威二港。今則由淸津港經會寗。而入西比利亞鐵道。可赴歐洲。不啻東洋之交通大動脈。將來不問人或貨。皆須經由我地。斯時也。我把此交通大動脈。可以不客氣的侵略滿蒙。　實行明治大帝第三期滅亡滿蒙之計劃。　如斯即是大和民族征服世界矣。」又云「如吉會路可成。在南滿北與朝鮮成爲大循環綫路。其長春至洮南。長春至大賚。大賚至洮南。成爲小循環綫路。可以四通八達。利我軍旅及食料原料運輸之便。是北滿富源之征服。亦可確定矣。···是故不得不準備吉會長大二路。以作武裝之充實。增强國防之勢力。···夫吉會路者。眞可謂日本至富之綫。亦日本武裝之路綫也。」觀乎田中義一之言。吾人可瞭然於日人對東北侵略之鐵道政策。</p>
<p>實預有周密之計劃。前後一貫。而對於吉會路之完成。尤爲彼國所渴望。此次交涉之最大動機。即爲本其一貫的政策。謀其實現。並謀吉會路之完成。假如日人陰謀實現。自彼國言之。固爲新大陸政策之成功。但自我國方面言之。即無異死刑之宣告。田中之語。一字如一彈。向我猛襲。國人讀後。感想如何。而對於此次協商。感想又如何。次之去年秋間日本濱口内閣受國内敵黨攻擊。頗呈不安現象。欲以對外交涉。轉移國人視綫。並打破内閣難關。亦其動機之一。此種政策。在日已迭見不鮮。如從前淸日戰爭。及五三事件。皆此種政策所引出。日人爲欲圑結國内。以對我侵略爲唯一對策。淸日一戰。慘痛尙有。五三慘劇。血痕猶新。我國何以歷次爲日人消滅黨爭之對象。國人於此。亦應深長思慮。此外近年來我國家之統一。民族之覺醒。東北鐵道港政之着着進展。尤其葫蘆島築港。東北四路聯運。並减低運額。逐漸實施國有鐵道網系之計劃。都足以使日人驚駭錯愕。深懼其在東北侵略得來之權利動搖。欲以外交手段。實行進一步之侵略。亦其一因。故近來日本政客軍人。朝野上下。都故意張大其辭。危言聳聽。或謂我國壓迫滿鐵。違背條約。侵犯日人權利。舉國呶呶。一若大禍臨頭。不可終朝。種種怪調。不一而足。茲爲易於明晰起見。特將日本各圑體與個人對鐵道問題之一般狂論。摘要表示如次。</p>

<p>主張要點</p>
<p>我國輿論、每値對付滿洲問題時、輒圑結一致、此已屢見者、吾願中國當局者注意此項事實、靑島之歸還、固非由日本人民之一致决定、今對於中國之企圖收回關東州租借區及南滿鐵道、日本人民已表示一致抗議、自去年以來、日本公衆對中國反日政策之痛烈抗議、固嶄然在吾人記憶之中、中日關係之種種方面、非此短篇所克討論、而帝俄之侵略滿洲、日本戰而敗之、一方爲己、一方亦爲中國、當日本爲中國之自由而戰時、中國袖手旁觀、日本於物質精神兩方、損失甚巨、若中國謂去一帝國主義的俄羅斯、來一帝國主義的日本、則爲不知感恩、當日俄戰爭之前、俄已將沿海州黑龍江及貝加爾省置於俄全國同一之行政制度之下、若非日本阻其勢力之進行、則滿洲已早爲俄土非中國所有矣、</p>
<p>今日本之注意滿洲問題、乃爲其經濟利益、滿洲之開發至今日地步、係日本二十年努力經營之結果、中國政治家近年大肆宣傳、指日本在滿洲具有野心、然日本之願望、不過致成滿洲之經濟的及文化的建設耳、此在中國諸領袖亦明知之、且滿洲因開發而産出之利益、其半數乃入中國公民之手、因日軍駐屯而致成之地方安定、其種種福利、亦華人所得、今日握政權之中國諸領袖、他日苟喪失權力者、孰能保其不擇大連爲其安樂土耶、查滿洲經濟情形、投資之最大部份、爲日人之金錢、其農産礦產之最大消費者、日人也、而移居滿洲之華人、如無日人鐵路之助、及不受日人投資之利益、亦無移住之可能、凡與滿洲當地華人接觸者、皆知彼等切望享受日人技術及經濟之利益、而因中國當局祇知保持祿位、不顧民衆福利、致人民不克享此經濟利益、日本旣發展滿洲至今日地步、對於滿洲問題、當然有就其自己觀點予以考慮之權、··········滿洲問題在日本原爲經濟問題、然若日本竟被迫而採取一種政治的解决法者、此乃由於中國負責當局輕舉妄動、爲保其自己政權而無所不爲之所致也、（未完）</p>

<p>— 海客</p>
<p>聽從口令的火車</p>
<p>火車是機械的沒有靈性的東西。怎麽會聽得出人們的口令呢。然而這一件事却是實在的。英京倫敦。曾陳列過一輛新發明的電氣火車模型。經專家加以試騐。只須喊一聲「停止」那引擎就立刻停止。再喊一聲「前去」。那引擎也就發動而前去了。據說内中的作用。是借重一個傳音器。而仗着聲浪的波動。以定進止。其構造是很複雜的。</p>
<p>九尺九寸長的大魚</p>
<p>英國北部史卡卜洛Ｓcarborough沿岸十四英里外的大海中。近曾捕得一尾很大的金槍魚。Ｔunny計長九英尺又九英寸。重六百磅。在魚族中。可算是龐然大物了。據老於漁業的人說。這樣的魚。在北海Ｎorth　Sea中也許可以捕到。因爲三年以前北海中的水較爲温暖。金槍魚曾經出現。</p>
<p>一萬年的租約</p>
<p>世界無論那一國。關於地產出租的限期。至多不過數十年。不道芬蘭拉蒂Ｌahti鎭。以一處地產租與一家煤油公司。作爲加油的詀。竟破天荒的訂下了一萬年的租約。這也可算是租約中的新紀錄。</p>

<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>自别京都。倐焉兩載。乃者校課畢事。因偕友再度觀光。所見所聞。頗多足紀者。爰爲述之。</p>
<p>中山路旁。原極荒凉。今則已成爲繁盛市塲與政治中心。偉大宏麗之建築。所在皆是。蕯家灣一帶。爲各部會萃集之區。已落成者有鐵道部·海軍部·軍政部等。在建築中者有交通部·財政部等。規模之大。令人咋舌。鐡道部官舍。爲宮殿式。極美輪美奂之能事。建築中之交通部。正與鐵道部望衡對宇。惟氣魄似尤過之。</p>
<p>上海外灘爲銀行街。四馬路爲書店街。南京之銀行街則在大行宮一帶。各行已標明建築地基。惟尙未興工。書店街則在花牌樓。有書肆十餘。南京新築之馬路。較滬上爲闊。且有時另於柏油路旁築較狹之石子路。專行馬車。氣象威嚴。建設之力量偉矣哉。</p>
<p>公共汽車昔由數公司分營。今已歸興華一家獨佔。女售票因多所糾紛。已不復用。興華公司聞爲某要人所辦。故無論何項軍人。一律購票。聞購票時亦頗滑稽。不論遠近。軍人祇出銅元三枚。殆亦爲敷衍面子計也。</p>
<p>京中有聲電影。風行一時。國民大戲院尤爲個中翹楚。所映多海上名片。座客滿坑滿谷。惟建築方面。與滬上相差尙遠。發音亦不淸晰。夫子廟一帶之歌女淸唱。近來已營業不振。殆亦時尙所趨。歸之天然淘汰也。</p>
<p>飛機訓練。無日無之。而其種種表演。尤令人舌橋不能下。或則左右翻騰。或則上下疾駛。動心駭目。不可卒睹。其因而失事者。亦日有所聞。比來軍事緊張。飛機更見重要。德美敎官。正努力訓練。不日將有大隊出發云。</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>老少年。爲雁來紅之異名。秋籬之絶妙點綴也。然予之所謂老少年。蓋指趙半跛、吳子鼎、二老人。馬萬里一少年而言。天機變化。佳手通神。寂歷之畫苑。爲之騰輝生色。亦佳話也已。老少年之畫展會。前曾作一度之觀賞。至今猶縈繫於腦蒂。萬里爲花卉妙手。所作皆超拔爽雋。淸芬襲人。曾農髯先生稱之爲觸處生春。非虚譽也。一水仙寥寥數筆。而逸氣滿縑幅。尤爲精品。萱萱氣韻蕭散。趣致自然。允推絶藝。半跛所作。更以疏落澹遠見長。神似靑藤雪箇。此半跛之所以取藤雪二字顏其寓樓也。子鼎吳瑞汾。於人物仕女爲最工。深得改七薌之神髓。竹喧歸浣女一幀。寫竹殊見功夫。蘇長公云。畫竹必先得成竹於胸中。子鼎其殆胸有成竹者歟。乞巧尋梅諸圖。亦細針密縷爲之。海上不易多覯也。子鼎於客冬赴皖歙。任縣暑秘書之職。以閒雲野鶴之性。不不耐案牘政委之煩。於日前脫然來申。挾得黃山松若干株。輸送之費。耗數百緡。不之惜也。子鼎固工吟詠。頗多紀勝之什。舟沿富春江而行。過嚴陵瀨。適在夜夢中。因有夜深偷過釣魚臺之句。子鼎寓吳中閭邱坊巷。詩酒嘯傲。書畫怡情。渥丹童顏。洵神仙中人也。</p>

<p>蒸鰱　鰱魚之頭。加雞湯火腿片。置飯鑊上淸蒸。其味特美</p>
<p>凍鴿　鴿子斬成爲釘。加醫油紅燒。出鑊後。置冰箱内。則凝結爲凍。外撒甘草茴香末少許。</p>

<p>— 孫麟昌</p>
<p>「接吻」。是愛情熱烈的表現。有情男女。兩唇相觸。甜蜜沉醉。而現在時髦人物。拚命的仿效洋化以爲「接吻」也是出自西俗。不知道「接吻」這種韻事。在中國從前早已就有了。不過西俗是公開的。中國是秘密的。像古人詠妓詩。「半點朱唇萬客嘗」。就是現在的「接吻」呀。還有郭舍人「　妃女唇甘如飴」。西廂記「口索舌」。對於「接吻」的描寫。何等逼肖。「接吻」是樁醉心的事。「情人一吻。勝於黃金十鎰」。可是據某衛生家說。「接吻爲傳染病之媒介。每接吻一次。必有若干萬微生物互相交換於唇吻之間」。兩性多情的同胞。不可不注意呀。</p>
<p>畫眉詩。「之子淸揚。」淸指目。揚即指眉言。又「　首蛾眉」言美人之眉。以此爲最。古時當係天然。乃修眉非畫眉也。宋玉招魂賦。「蛾眉曼睩曼訓澤式」此言畫也。其後文君遠出絳仙秀色。京兆眉嫵。瑩姊眉癖。均係畫者。唐明皇有十眉圖。如橫雲。斜月等是。畫眉在五代宮中。計十類。（一）開元御愛。（二）小山。（三）五岳。（四）三峯。（五）埀珠。（六）月稜。（七）粉梢（八）涵烟。（九）拂雲。（十）倒暈。不知現代何以無人講究耳</p>

<p>— 湯成辛</p>
<p>吾友有兒。年方五齡。羸瘠如衰翁。終歲投補劑。殊不效。近且患傷寒。繼以瘖發。醫師有難色。其母愛之甚。終日啜泣。不知爲計。顧其家素富有。向使養有得宜。壯健應軼常兒。乃愛不以道。於兒童生理之原則。反忽焉不察。卒至病象日著。始乞靈藥石。然已晚矣。茲特將其育護失當之處。略述一二。以告世之育兒者。俾知所注意。勿復循其覆轍。吾友聞之。倘亦不以爲忤也。</p>
<p>方兒之初生也。乳傭餧以乳。有時偶吐其哺。即悞爲過飽。禁勿復飼。小兒啼飢不顧也。迄四齡。猶不令斷乳。亦不飯之。終歲幽之高閣。復緊閉其窗牑。氣候稍寒。輒倍衣之。臃腫如不倒翁。於是兒體日尫弱。父母猶不知變計。一若惟恐其不病者然。雖舐犢情深。其用心本無可訾議。然因育護不當。終戕其身。殊不能無遺憾也。謔者謂彼之忽視科學。與蓄意假手科學而置小兒於危厄者何以異。不知彼爲父母者。將何辭以曲解之乎。</p>

<p>大學房舍整齊。規模壯麗。余語文克託侖君。印人不注意於政治。而注意宗敎哲學。將來甘地主義若擴至鄕村各地。汝印度又試行無政府主義。今人民自古不注意政治。不須解政治。止附屬於學區。多辦工讀村。如甘地等之首領支配已足矣。意者印度果有自由之一日。似此亦一夢想也。</p>
<p>印度學生禮貌甚都。循循有節。全無悍氣。不似中國學生之鼓動潮流。亦尙無以學生爲主人敎員爲客體之風。猶守善良之習慣。余參觀其飯堂。非如我國之用桌椅而食。乃坐於地上地上或舖木板。或舖氈毯。每人用一銅盤。盤中置二肴與米飯。以手進食。大抵午間食飯。晚時食麥餅其餅與中國無大異。惟北方所製名單餅。印度之餅較小。有時加油耳。</p>
<p>二十五日。學生導我游花園。據云此市有許多花園。有公共者。亦有私人者。余至花園中。見有許多花。其花壇有種種形狀。殊爲美觀。印人愛花。采花獻佛。自古所稱。燒香散花。至今猶然。其花四時不凋。爲印度特色。但余覺熱帶之花。香者不多耳。是日與各敎授議。囑我爲亞洲敎育會作一宣言。略述自古亞洲文化之盛。一切人種與宗敎皆源自亞洲。各聖人無以殺爲敎者。有之。自近世敎育始。應以人道主義公平支配社會。謀世界之大同。此責任須亞洲人士之覺悟與聯絡。且大戰以後。歐人渴望東方化之西漸。故應力謀組織。以爲世界和平宣傳云。至於全亞聯絡。當然爲一大問題。不過以我所知。及接洽上經騐。聯絡之渴望。以印人爲最。在中國則殊不覺。因中人不注意及此。注意者甚少。或其目光短淺故與。至能相聯絡者。印人可聯中日等佛敎國。當然無問題。惟回敎各國殊難聯絡。若華人爲之。比較上爲易。回人與華人感情甚好。僞於印人也。可派人至土而基聯絡。並不難。</p>

<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>月如走下樓去後，子良把亭子間的門掩着。他重新坐下來的時候，不免想起舊事來了。從前他在未結婚的時候，往往想：「將來我有了妻室，每天晚上回去，我在燈下讀書，我老婆坐在旁邊伴讀，伊做做針綫，陪我到夜靜更深，豈不有趣？那知結婚之後，理想與事實，相差太遠了。現在子良要用功，就絶對不能使伊留在旁邊：否則一味胡閙，那裹能夠做什麽事？子良又想：「我若經濟寛裕，一定尋什麽廟宇之中，去租一間房子，在裹頭用用功，可以避免這美麗的惡魔，常來纏不淸楚。照這樣下去，我下半年起，索性寄宿在校裹了。」</p>
<p>亭子間的門，呀的一響，月如笑嘻嘻地直立在門口，手裹捧着一隻大碗：</p>
<p>「别用功罷！點心來了！」</p>
<p>伊送到子良桌上，子良看時，這大碗中，倒有七八樣東西：一塊燒餅，一個饅頭，一個湯糰，一塊方糕，一條油條，一個葱油餅，一個小麵包，十景果盤那麽凑在一起；不過每一樣東西，只有一件。</p>
<p>「這算什麽？又不是什麽貨樣，樣樣都是一件。」</p>
<p>「難題目，只有你會出！問你吃什麽點心，你說隨便，我那裹猜得到你肚子裹？只好多買幾樣，就總有一樣是你合意的東西了！</p>
<p>子良不去聽伊的理論，餓也餓得夠了，只得拿來就吃；不過時候已經不早，他不敢多吃，留一小半在碗中：</p>
<p>「拿去罷！」</p>
<p>「吃飤飽了肚子，就要驅逐接濟糧餉的人，眞沒有良心！」</p>
<p>夫人拿了大碗去；但是伊不下樓，往前房去了。歇了一下，只聽得樓板上有連續不斷的脚聲，伊口中，拉拉拉拉的呌着，原來在那裹練習跳舞。有一次，有一位朋友來訪潘子良，坐在樓下，其時恰巧夫人也在樓上練跳舞，朋友聽得樓板上有響聲，便抬頭一看，不料樓板上的灰塵落下來，恰巧落在那位朋友的眼睛裹，弄得睜又睜不開，拿又拿不出，後來呌一個理髮匠來帮着拿去的。</p>

<p>紗市略堅、因銀價又縮、致人心稍佳、但海外花紗狀况一致趨落、而現紗交易未能詳細　問、因紗布交易所爲十周紀念日、午後在大東開游藝會、多數不在市上、以致集會者絶跡、市情難以調查、祇聞二十支藍鳳紗一百五十包價爲一百八十五兩、立馬一百八十五兩、一百包、均係同行進行七八月期、其他未有詳細情形、明日當可補誌云、</p>

<h3 id="c187">關於人物畫 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 木下孝則著　陳抱一譯</p>
<p>……這是要我就人物畫之技法、淺易地、於Ａmateur（非專門家）也能懂的程度而說明的一回事、</p>
<p>却說、普通起首習畫時、是先從靜物入手、次是風景、而後到人物、這樣的一種順序的、而以人物比較最難、便在寫生時、人物、也斷不能像靜物那樣、使他一直定止着不動的、而且、有了些許錯誤、即能看出而感到不妥、倒是很不容易如意成就的、…是故、如能普通地繪描人物畫、便以爲有如畢業一般了、可是、我們若試行描寫各種的畫來看、即使是似乎易繪的靜物畫、或人物畫、也終於感到不知究竟那一種困難了、</p>
<p>所以、無論風景、無論靜物、要之、只要我們能繪成好畫、那就行了、</p>
<p>至於若說……靜物畫、怎樣繪描才成好畫呢、風影畫應如何描寫、又、人物畫應如何描寫才好呢、……這種問題、然而我覺得「畫」這東西、原沒有怎樣的畫便須以怎樣的技法來描寫的一種固定不易的法則的、又如所謂「好畫」是怎樣的一種畫呢、這問題倒是不如口講那般容易解决的、……這個、我倒不知怎樣來說明、而除了說難於說明之外、沒有法子了</p>
<p>現在、我所欲對習畫者說的、就是……如其欲繪畫、則先來拿起調色板和畫筆、站在畫布之前、將所欲描的東西、即惹動藝術心情的東西來表現、去描繪於畫布上、而由於追求那所欲表現的東西、則自會有「技法」產生出來、追求愈深、則結果愈能繪出好畫來的、</p>
<p>但、現在問我……「你是常繪人物畫的、究竟依着如何順序而描寫的呢、」……旣然如此、則不妨把我自己的未熟的經騐來披露一下、如能有俾益於閱者、那就幸甚了、</p>
<p>……且來談談我的經騐、</p>
<p>我作畫時、是很少思量着理論而繪的、</p>
<p>現在、假定描寫一個女人半身像、試就描法的順序而說、……起先、從顏面之表情、肌膚之色彩、體態之氣感、而物色了一個欲繪入畫裹的人物、則請她先定了姿勢、斷而便注意到背景及衣服的色彩、顏面之色、由全體所致的調和、姿態的形狀等等、調整一下、</p>
<p>於是、據此便選定畫布之大小及幅面之形（例如方形或長方等｜譯者注）、而於畫布上可定人物之佈局、停當了、便先從色彩與色彩對照所來的「郮和」及「調子」、而落筆塗描、</p>
<p>開首、是往往從頭髮、其髮際額邊的色、和背景的色先塗、以作成畫面全體調子底基本、……這樣的時候較多、而以求理解「自然」的心情去進行工作、而常把「物之實在」置諸念頭裹、依照色元調和以追求物之質量、但、這樣繼續繪了三天、中途便見調子錯亂起來、而終於失敗了、……這是我的經騐、</p>
<p>我曾被人詢問……「你的背景的色、是用什麽顏色所塗的呢、」我雖則塗了這裹色彩、但我記得是這樣回答他……「我倒弄不淸楚、好像是有Ｍoir　do　PechoOchre　Jauoe　B1　Ceruleum混在裹面的」、我以爲與其說是忘記了用何色相混、無寗是起先便沒有留意到這點、</p>
<p>正如這般情形、我繪畫的時候是無意識的、是故、要我說明繪畫的順序、也便感到困難了、照以上那樣的說明、似乎也無何俾益、</p>
<p>上面雖題爲人物畫的講話、而說過技法上並無固定不易的一種技法、但是、自古以來、不限於人物畫、許多畫家、都是爲了繪畫苦悶而作種種考慮、並且見了名畫、而把其理論分别出來以說明繪畫的方法、……自然我們也知道縱令照着理論而繪畫、也未必會有好畫作成之理、但我以爲若把理論以資參考、則自能獲益不淺、在這里、最好是能把這種所謂「技法」的東西來說述一下、然而「技法」不是簡單的東西、故只好讓日後之機會再行說述了、</p>

<h3 id="c188">男性的文學 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 君蕭</p>
<p>希臘詩人西利渥斯李加士（ＦheuosＲigas）當他從阿蘇士山峯下眺、這樣和着眼涙的喊道、</p>
<p>「已不是哭的時候了、是要幹的呵、」</p>
<p>「哭」是女性的動作、「幹」是男性的動作、「哭」的文學是女性的文學、「幹」的文學是男性的文學、</p>
<p>在作品的風度上因爲顯示了一種熱情的刺激、使人們無形之中受着極大的感動和鼓舞、像阿靈匹斯（Ａlympus）山上爬出來的大陽神一般的莊嚴而偉大、同時又是力的追求的緬想、這是「男性」文學的象徵、</p>
<p>現在、帕米爾高原發脈的民族、我們知道是已經迫近了一個危難而動搖的階段、是極其顯明的、不去「幹」、先只夢想以和平的手腕、消極的抵禦、能達到自由平等的希望、是絶對沒有這樣容易的、所以在這種情况之下、凡屬於勇健前進性的、富有刺激性的、｜男性的文學、爲目前極端的需要、但在過去的事實上、是給我們失望、除了那些把生命擲在醉酒的杯裹、把生命寄托在天鵝絨樣的女人胸膛裹、温柔的憔悴自傷的文章以外、我們所希望的是始終沒有看到、</p>
<p>最近第五期「前鋒月刋」上的兩篇小說、我讀了後心里所感到的也正是這樣、一篇是黃震遐的「隴海綫上」、一篇是萬國安的「刹那的革命」、這兩篇都是描寫戰爭的文學、正似李博士所謂、「已不是哭的時候了、是要斡的呵、」具有這種性質的作品、在中國中庸平和的國度裹面呈現、這現象也多少給了我們一個寂寞中的歡喜、因爲我們現在需要的正是這一類、</p>

After Chairman Yu Youren conducted the ceremony, Committee Member Ding Weifen reported on the significance of commemorating the sixth anniversary of the National Government's establishment. He stated that the National Government has been established for six years, and this foundation exists today due to the efforts of the officers and soldiers and the support of the people. Today, as we commemorate the establishment of the National Government, we should recall the difficulties faced by the Premier in creating the Republic of China. Everyone should take responsibility and build China, so that the foundation of the National Government will become increasingly solid. Only then can the National Government exist permanently. He expressed hope that the entire country would work together towards this goal. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<p>Lu Dipin Takes Office as Garrison Commander</p>
<p>Cai Tingkai and Others Return to Nanchang</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Nanchang Dispatch, (1) As the general offensive order is imminent, the headquarters has telegraphed troops stationed on the border of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces to strictly prevent and defend. Military situation reports must be submitted promptly, avoiding unnecessary formalities to ensure speed. (2) When Chiang departed, he ordered the Xiehe Hospital and the Shanghai Red Cross Hospital to select and send a total of forty doctors and nurses to Jiangxi to take on rear medical duties. The headquarters has now received a report that these personnel are expected to arrive in Xun on the 2nd. The Railway Bureau has been ordered to prepare trains to meet them. (3) Tan Daoyuan, after being appointed as the commander of the Fifth Route Army, will request orders to depart within the next few days. (4) The newly formed siege brigade commander, Qiu Zhao Chen, will go to the front lines to participate in the battle. The police brigade commander, Li Yannian, has been formally transferred to the position of deputy commander of the Second Guard Division. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Nanchang Dispatch, (1) The two bandits, Kong and Li, led the pseudo-Seventh Army, the Eighteenth Army, and independent divisions, etc., and fled on both the north and south routes, directly attacking Yuanzhou and Wanzai. After being surrounded and attacked by our army's Yi and Qiao units, over a thousand bandits were killed and many items were seized. Currently, the Kong bandit has fled to Liuyang, and the Li bandit has also fled to the border of Hunan. (2) The Red Bandits have recently been extremely panicked.

<p>US-French Negotiations Have Made No Progress</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 30th The Laval cabinet in France has again achieved a great victory in the Senate, passing a motion of confidence in the government's policy towards the Hoover plan by an overwhelming majority of 197 votes to 5. This debate lasted only a few hours, unlike the fierce debate in the House of Representatives. After the meeting, Prime Minister Laval immediately stood up to answer a senator's question and his request for a detailed report on the government's attitude. Laval's wording was roughly similar to that in the House of Representatives, solemnly declaring that the principle guiding the government in negotiations with the US government is to recognize the Young Plan as the final settlement of reparations, which must not be infringed upon. However, given Germany's financial difficulties, France is willing to make some temporary concessions. Finally, former President Millerand spoke, welcoming the visit of the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister to France, saying it would be beneficial to German-French friendship, but firmly insisting that when the two countries' leaders meet, Germany must be required to recognize Poland's existing borders and abandon the German-Austrian Customs Union. It would be even better if a Locarno Pact for Eastern Europe could be concluded.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Washington, 30th A US government spokesman claimed that there are three points of disagreement between France and the US regarding President Hoover's plan. However, the US is willing to make concessions on one of them, while insisting on the other two.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 30th US officials indicated this afternoon that the situation of the negotiations between the US and France on war debts is serious, but the US government is not discouraged and still hopes that an agreement can be reached. Dispatches from Paris said that today's negotiation position is the same as yesterday's.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 1st The issue of suspending war debt payments was originally scheduled to resume negotiations this morning. However, because US Treasury Secretary Mellon had not yet received new instructions from Washington, it was changed to this afternoon. The reason why the US government delayed issuing instructions was to wait for a report from the US ambassador to Germany on recent contacts with the German authorities. Therefore, political circles here are not anxious about the postponement of negotiations. The newspapers of the Radical Socialist Party even said that the negotiations had failed, and the French government was not disappointed because it could then open direct negotiations with Berlin.</p>

<p>Awaiting the Outcome of Negotiations</p>
<p>To Decide on Emergency Measures</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (National Telegram) - It is widely rumored in political circles tonight that if the French-American negotiations fail to reach a satisfactory conclusion quickly, Germany will declare a two-year suspension of conditional reparations based on the Young Plan. When questioned, government officials neither confirmed nor denied this, only repeatedly stating that the government firmly maintains a position of non-interference in the French-American negotiations and will decide on emergency financial measures for Germany based on the outcome. However, the hurried atmosphere in various departments directly or indirectly related to the reparations plan suggests that the German government is preparing various emergency measures before the next Young Plan payment due on July 15th. Newspaper commentaries generally echo similar implications. However, nationalistic newspapers advocate proceeding independently and not being delayed by the stalemate in Paris, lest they suffer the consequences. Moderate newspapers advocate patiently waiting, hoping that France will soften under pressure from the United States.</p>

<p>Unconditionally Accepts US Proposal</p>
<p>Brussels, 30th (National Telegram) - The Belgian government's reply to the American proposal to suspend war debts, published here today, states that President Hoover's plan is the beginning of a great effort to stabilize the international situation, which Belgium readily accepts without reservation. It then asserts Belgium's right to compensation for damages suffered during the war, expressing hope that President Hoover will acknowledge the necessity of reconciling this with Belgium's special position and interests when implementing the plan. Diplomatic circles here express satisfaction that Belgium, despite witnessing the strong opposition of its closest ally, France, has expressed its willingness to accept the proposal without special reservations.</p>

<p>Approves Postponement of Due Debt Payments</p>
<p>Rome, 30th (National Telegram) - The Italian government today formally notified the governments of Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria that Italy does not wish to demand the reparations and war debts due on July 1st. If President Hoover's plan cannot be realized, the payments can be made later. At the same time, it notified the British and American governments that Italy is willing to pay the war debts due to the two countries tomorrow. This action by the Italian government demonstrates its firm belief that the plan to suspend war debts for one year, even if delayed by France, will eventually be fully realized.</p>

<p>Suspension Proposal Difficult to Implement Temporarily</p>
<p>Pending US-French Agreement</p>
<p>Washington, 1st (Reuters) - It is emphatically denied here that President Hoover suggested, as reported by London newspapers, that other countries should implement his suspension proposal even if France does not cooperate.</p>
<p>London, 1st (National Telegram) - According to the British Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, France risks plunging all countries into a difficult situation, and President Hoover's proposal to suspend war debts for one year will not benefit France. Today, the newspaper published an article signed by its political correspondent, E. Whyman, stating that the US government has informed Germany that President Hoover has notified Britain, Italy, and other countries related to the suspension of war debts, declaring that he will immediately implement his plan, leaving France out. Therefore, if France continues to refuse to endorse President Hoover's plan, Germany will continue to pay France its share of reparations, but France must also pay its war debts to the US and Britain. Whyman also stated that if President Hoover implements his plan regardless of France, the United States may lend money to Germany so that Germany can, at France's request, deposit the so-called unconditional annuity into the International Bank next year. Although the US loan to Germany goes to France, and France uses it to repay its war debts to the US, the money ultimately returns to the US, only with an additional borrowing step. A week ago, the US government proposed this idea, believing that if France were the only country required to repay its war debts to Britain and the US next year, it would inevitably apply to Britain and the US for a postponement. If that were the case, its credibility would suffer. Therefore, France cannot remain isolated.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Internal Strife within the British Liberal Party <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Future of the Labour Cabinet is Precarious</p>
<p>London, 30th (Telecommunications) - Viscount Allendale, treasurer of the British Liberal Party, formally resigned today in opposition to party leader Lloyd George's policy of supporting the Labour cabinet. Viscount Allendale declared his opposition to Lloyd George's support of the Labour cabinet during the recent parliamentary debate on the Land Valuation Bill Amendment. Unless George resigns as leader of the Liberal Party, he will not take consistent action in the House of Commons. However, he will continue to adhere to the principles of the Liberal Party. Also, General Sir John Seely, among others, expressed their opposition to George at the same time as Viscount Allendale. All are prominent figures within the Liberal Party. The conflict between party members and the party leader is intensifying. A large number of party members are expected to rise up in opposition in the coming days. This internal strife within the Liberal Party will not only cause more trouble within the party, but it will also have a greater impact on the Labour cabinet. MacDonald's cabinet has faced many crises, but it has been able to continue in power with the support of the Liberal Party. Therefore, the fate of the Labour cabinet will depend on whether it can obtain the ultimate support of the Liberal Party. Not only Britain, but also all countries in Europe are paying close attention to its development.</p>

Passing through Hangzhou in haste, I did not meet with any guests or reporters. After arriving at the mountain, I read a news report in the Hangzhou Min Guo Bao on the 30th stating that I expressed my views on the opium prohibition issue, which I find deeply shocking. This report is completely unfounded and not factual. It is clearly a fabricated statement. In addition to sending a separate letter to the newspaper for correction, I am deeply concerned that the public may be misled by misinterpretations.

<p>Among today's youth, we can hear cries of "no way out" everywhere. Some weep, some appeal, some are indignant, and some are so despairing that they resort to desperate measures to vent their grief and anger. Still others take their own lives in hopes of ending it all. Various tragic phenomena abound. This is indeed a very serious social problem today and an irreparable loss to our country. It is currently the summer vacation. Another large group of young people from middle schools and universities in the country, as well as students studying abroad, will graduate and enter society to seek a livelihood. Some compare schools to factories...</p>
<p>Students are like products. Students entering society to seek employment is like a product seeking sales. But today, our country's schools only know how to produce and do not care about sales. As a result, sales stagnate, and the goods accumulate and rot. This painful statement is worthy of our deep thought and long consideration. However, is it true that today's youth have no way out? We dare say they do. The problem is that the youth lack a spirit of creation. With the vastness of our country's land and the abundance of its resources, the Northeast and Northwest have thousands of miles of wasteland waiting to be developed. Various social undertakings are waiting to be organized. Where can aspiring youth not find a way out? Where can they not thrive? If they only seek to succeed by relying on others and cannot create new undertakings to enrich their new lives, then their desire to be unswayed by wealth and status, unyielding to poverty and humility, and unafraid of power and force will ultimately lead to a life of resentment and a depressing death. How can this be achieved? Aspiring youth should start by creating their own paths, cultivating virgin land with the spirit of Columbus discovering the New World and with the courage of Robinson Crusoe exploring a desert island. They should strive to develop their new lives and work hard to save themselves, which is also saving society, saving the country, and benefiting humanity. If they merely appeal and wait for others to save them, who knows when the long night will end? Youth, youth, wake up, wake up!</p>

<h3 id="e60">The Great Importance of the Northeast China-Japan Railway Negotiations <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Currently, our country's diplomatic issues are numerous and of utmost importance. From completing legal rights negotiations, proceeding with the recovery of concessions, the Sino-Soviet conference, and the recent Northeast China-Japan railway negotiations, all are major diplomatic issues concerning our country's recovery of sovereignty. If there is even one of these, our people should devote all their efforts to address it, fearing that they might not be doing enough. If they remain indifferent and apathetic, focusing instead on internal problems, scrutinizing and discussing them as if some problem or matter is as urgent as a shooting star and imminent, more important than external issues, then without domestic support and facing powerful foreign nations, seeking the smooth progress of diplomacy will be even more difficult. Observing European and American countries, whenever a diplomatic issue arises, the entire nation unites with a consistent spirit and devotes all efforts to address it. Even women and children encourage each other to participate, not stopping until the goal of victory is achieved. Reflecting on our country, what is the situation? Take, for example, the Northeast China-Japan railway negotiations discussed in this article. The Japanese government and public discuss and research, advocate construction, publicize in newspapers, and discuss in private. All eyes are focused, almost regarding this matter as the most important political issue for Japan today. Can our people achieve such importance as the Japanese government and public? In reality, in this negotiation, our country is passive in terms of position and is being invaded in terms of interests. Although the Japanese actions violate justice, they are acting with a unified national effort to scheme against us. Therefore, our country, in order to recover lost sovereignty and abolish unequal treaties, should approach these negotiations with the spirit of facing boiling water and flames, putting in tenfold the effort that the Japanese are putting into scheming against us, in order to defend ourselves and ultimately recover our sovereignty. This is the most valuable effort for our people and an indispensable effort for emerging nations. In recent years, our people have been talking about abolishing unequal treaties. However, how can this be achieved? Our people should think carefully about this. If we cannot unite internally and remain indifferent externally, how can we possibly achieve diplomatic victories? Therefore, from now on, our people should shift their focus from internal problems to diplomatic issues, revive our national spirit, and elevate our national status. All of this can be achieved with a single thought from our people; it is certainly not unattainable.</p>
<p>This Northeast railway negotiation, in terms of its nature, can only be regarded as a practical consultation between China and Japan on railway matters in the Northeast and cannot be considered a formal negotiation between the two countries. The scope of discussion is limited to practical issues on the railways of both countries. Anything beyond this is exceeding authority. In international formal negotiations, the central government of the opposing party must be the target. This time, Japan only notified our Northeast local government, which shows that its nature is purely a consultation on practical railway matters, similar to a commercial company consulting with another commercial company on some business issue. Aside from consultation on practical matters, the Japanese representatives absolutely cannot raise issues beyond the scope, and our representatives have no authority to accept discussions. Otherwise, both would be exceeding their authority. When people refer to this negotiation, they often call it "China-Japan Railway Negotiations." In fact, in terms of its nature and scope, it is not a formal negotiation but a practical consultation on railway affairs between Northeast China and Japan. A slight difference can lead to a great error. A temporary mistake may be used by the Japanese as a pretext in the future. People should seriously understand this point.</p>
<p>As for the Japanese motivation for initiating this negotiation, we can consider it to be (1) due to the consistent implementation of the Japanese policy of invading Northeast China's railways, and (2) due to the Hamaguchi Cabinet's desire last fall to eliminate domestic party disputes through foreign affairs. Historically, the Japanese policy towards railways in Northeast China has been roughly threefold: one is the South Manchurian Railway (SMR) centric policy, the second is the "Great Circular" policy, and the third is the double-track double-port policy. The overt and covert struggles over the years have been nothing more than attempts to realize this conspiracy. In the Tanaka Cabinet's memorial to the Emperor, regarding the active policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia, it stated: "...In the future, it is necessary to build a Great Circular line in Manchuria and Mongolia for military purposes, which can surround the center of Manchuria and Mongolia to control China's military, political, and economic development..." It also stated, "The railways that I (Japan) urgently want to build in Manchuria and Mongolia are: (1) the Tongliao-Jehol railway; (2) the Taonan-Solun railway; (3) a part of the Changchun-Taonan railway; (4) the Jilin-Huiyuan railway; (5) the Hunchun-Hailin railway." Among these, the Jilin-Huiyuan line is the most critical to our country's survival. Therefore, Tanaka also stated, "...If this railway (the Jilin-Huiyuan railway) is completed, it will be the success of our New Continent policy. In the past, those who wanted to go to Europe had to go through the ports of Dalian and Vladivostok. Now, they can go to Europe from Chongjin Port via Hweryong and enter the Siberian Railway. This is nothing less than a major transportation artery in the Orient. In the future, regardless of people or goods, they will all have to pass through our territory. At that time, we can unceremoniously invade Manchuria and Mongolia through this transportation artery and implement the Meiji Emperor's third-stage plan to destroy Manchuria and Mongolia. This will be the conquest of the world by the Yamato race." It also stated, "If the Jilin-Huiyuan line can be completed, a large circular line will be formed in southern Manchuria, connecting it with northern Manchuria and Korea. The lines from Changchun to Taonan, Changchun to Dalai, and Dalai to Taonan will form small circular lines, which can be accessible in all directions, facilitating the transportation of our troops, food, and raw materials. The conquest of the rich resources of northern Manchuria can also be determined... Therefore, it is necessary to prepare the Jilin-Huiyuan and Changchun-Dalai lines to strengthen our military forces and enhance our national defense... The Jilin-Huiyuan road can truly be called the road to Japan's wealth and the road to Japan's armed forces." Looking at the words of Tanaka Giichi, we can clearly understand the Japanese railway policy of invading Northeast China.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a detailed and consistent plan, and the completion of the Jilin-Huiyuan road is particularly desired by that country. The biggest motivation for this negotiation is to implement its consistent policy and seek its realization, as well as seek the completion of the Jilin-Huiyuan road. If the Japanese conspiracy is realized, from their perspective, it would be the success of the New Continent policy. But from our country's perspective, it is equivalent to a death sentence. Tanaka's words are like bullets, attacking us fiercely. What are our people's thoughts after reading this? And what are their thoughts on this negotiation? Secondly, last fall, the Japanese Hamaguchi Cabinet was under attack from domestic rival parties, presenting a rather precarious situation. It wanted to divert the public's attention and overcome the cabinet's difficulties through foreign negotiations. This kind of policy has been seen repeatedly in Japan. For example, the former Sino-Japanese War and the May Thirtieth Incident were both caused by this kind of policy. The Japanese want to unite domestically and use aggression against us as the only countermeasure. The pain of the Sino-Japanese War is still present, and the bloodstains of the May Thirtieth tragedy are still fresh. Why has our country repeatedly been the target of Japan's elimination of party disputes? Our people should also think deeply about this. In addition, in recent years, our country's unification, the awakening of the nation, the steady progress of Northeast China's railway and port policies, especially the construction of Huludao Port, the joint operation of the four Northeast roads, and the reduction of freight rates, and the gradual implementation of the plan to nationalize the railway network, have all shocked and bewildered the Japanese. They deeply fear that the rights they have gained through aggression in Northeast China will be shaken. They want to carry out further aggression through diplomatic means, which is also one of the reasons. Therefore, recently, Japanese politicians and soldiers, from the government to the public, have deliberately exaggerated their words, making alarming statements, or saying that our country is suppressing the South Manchurian Railway, violating treaties, and infringing on Japanese rights. The whole country is clamoring, as if a great disaster is imminent. There are all kinds of strange claims. For the sake of clarity, the general crazy theories of various Japanese groups and individuals on railway issues are summarized as follows.</p>

<p>Questions from Matsuoka in the 59th Japanese Diet</p>
<p>Main Points of Argument</p>
<p>The Jilin-Hunchun and Taonan-Dalian lines were successfully negotiated with the government authorities at the time by Mr. Yamamoto, the former president of the South Manchurian Railway, who came forward in person to Beijing. However, the government usually neglects this and fails to continue its efforts. It only started to engage in railway negotiations before the Diet session, which is a disregard for the interests of Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>

<p>2. Cut off the intersection points of the Shenyang-Hai and Beining lines.</p>
<p>3. Agree on freight rates to avoid competition.</p>

<p>Campaign for the Permanent Design of the South Manchurian Railway</p>
<p>Main Points of Argument</p>
<p>1. Half of the South Manchurian Railway's shares are held by the Japanese government. According to the nature of the South Manchurian Railway and the current situation in Manchuria and Mongolia, it is not yet time to break away from state control. Therefore, the hasty privatization theory should be rejected.</p>
<p>2. In order to ensure the permanent nature of the South Manchurian Railway, Imperial Ordinance No. 142 of Meiji 39 should be amended, and a South Manchurian Railway Council should be established. When the government appoints or changes the president, it must consult with the aforementioned Council and obtain its consent.</p>
<p>3. The aforementioned Council should be composed of those who have led the South Manchurian Railway and those who are highly respected by the government and the public. The number of members should be limited to 17, with a term of 7 years, and partial changes should be made after the term expires.</p>
<p>4. The Council should not interfere with the administration of the South Manchurian Railway.</p>

<p>Main Points of Argument</p>
<p>Regarding China's request to abolish legal rights, it expresses sympathy in principle. However, in view of the current situation, it is considered too early for immediate abolition. However, a gradual approach can be adopted when there is full assurance in practice regarding relations with other countries. It is hoped that the rights and interests of Manchuria and Mongolia will be secured, attention will be paid to the future of Sino-Japanese relations, and careful countermeasures will be studied.</p>

<p>Japan Overseas Comrades Association</p>
<p>Main Points of Argument</p>
<p>China is now using two methods to suppress the South Manchurian Railway: (1) disregarding past precedents and thoroughly engaging in low-price freight competition, and (2) planning to encircle the South Manchurian Railway. The intention is to reduce the economic value of the South Manchurian Railway and discourage our people from maintaining the South Manchurian Railway, in order to facilitate its recapture in the future. It is clear that at this time, it is better to make a decision to break the Chinese side's illusions. They will definitely use the above-mentioned means of suppression and gradually seek to annex territories.</p>
<p>Remarks</p>
<p>Initiators include 32 famous figures from government and the public, such as Kiyozumi Inoue and Narimoto Oi.</p>
<p>The recovery of sovereign rights, the stationing rights of guards, or even more difficult issues in the political sphere, are not difficult to foresee, as they will continue to push forward. It is appropriate to eradicate incidents before they grow. In order to defend the legitimate position of the Empire, it goes without saying that a certain attitude should be adopted. Regarding the aforementioned (1) unreasonable freight competition by China, our country (Japan) should take decisive countermeasures to make them realize the futility of competition. It is the best policy not to give them a painful blow, lest they merely engage in negotiations for compromise under the pretext of coexistence and co-prosperity, which is no different from surrender. The Empire should not do this at this time. Regarding the South Manchurian Railway encirclement plan mentioned in (2) above, the Japanese Empire should base itself on the 1905 Beijing Agreement on the prohibition of internal warfare, parallel lines, and competition lines, and vow to resist it. If any railway plans appear that erode these rights, they should be resolutely denied. In order to protect the interests of the agreement, the Empire should take self-defense measures when necessary and express its intention to break the Chinese side's illusions. Furthermore, regarding the Datong-Hunchun and Tao'an-Angxi-Jidun lines, which were laid despite the Empire's protests, and the Tao'an-Angxi and Jilin-Dunhua lines, which were built with loans from us (Japan), they all violate the original contracts. In order to protect our country's rights and interests, appropriate measures should be taken. Also, in accordance with the Gando Convention, China should be forced to allow our country to build the Jilin-Hweryong Railway at this time. If they refuse this request, our side should declare the abandonment of the Gando Convention and restore the state of the Tumen River border between the two countries before the establishment of the Convention. The reason why we requested to build this road is the consideration for abandoning the old Joseon territory rights in the Gando area. If China abandons the substance of the Convention on its own, it is only natural to occupy Gando.</p>

<p>For 115 people such as Kaneko Yudo</p>

<p>Main Points of Argument</p>
<p>Japanese public opinion always unites when dealing with the Manchuria issue, which has been seen repeatedly. I hope that the Chinese authorities will pay attention to this fact. The return of Qingdao was not determined by the unanimous decision of the Japanese people. Now, the Japanese people have expressed unanimous opposition to China's attempt to recover the leased area of ​​the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchurian Railway. Since last year, the Japanese public's strong protest against China's anti-Japanese policy has been clearly in our memory. Various aspects of Sino-Japanese relations cannot be discussed in this short article. However, the Tsarist Russia's invasion of Manchuria was defeated by Japan in the war. One side was for itself, and the other was for China. When Japan fought for China's freedom, China stood by and watched. Japan suffered huge losses in both material and spiritual terms. If China says that an imperialist Russia has been replaced by an imperialist Japan, it is ignorant of gratitude. Before the Russo-Japanese War, Russia had placed the Primorsky Krai, Heilongjiang, and Baikal provinces under the same administrative system as the entire Russian country. If Japan had not prevented its power from progressing, Manchuria would have long been Russian territory and not Chinese.</p>
<p>Today, Japan's attention to the Manchuria issue is for its economic interests. The development of Manchuria to this day is the result of Japan's 20 years of hard work. Chinese politicians have been widely publicizing in recent years, pointing out that Japan has ambitions in Manchuria. However, Japan's desire is nothing more than to achieve the economic and cultural construction of Manchuria. This is also well known to Chinese leaders. Moreover, half of the benefits from the development of Manchuria go to Chinese citizens. The local stability caused by the stationing of Japanese troops and the various benefits are also obtained by the Chinese. Today's Chinese leaders who hold power, who can guarantee that they will not choose Dalian as their safe haven if they lose power in the future? Looking at the economic situation in Manchuria, the largest part of the investment is Japanese money. The largest consumers of its agricultural and mineral products are the Japanese. And the Chinese who move to Manchuria would not be able to move without the help of Japanese railways and without the benefits of Japanese investment. Everyone who has contacted the local Chinese in Manchuria knows that they are eager to enjoy the benefits of Japanese technology and economy, but the Chinese authorities only know how to maintain their positions and ignore the welfare of the people, so the people cannot enjoy these economic benefits. Japan has developed Manchuria to this point, so it naturally has the right to consider the Manchuria issue from its own perspective. ...... The Manchuria issue was originally an economic issue in Japan, but if Japan is forced to adopt a political solution, it will be due to the irresponsible actions of the Chinese authorities, who will do anything to protect their own regime.

<p>Chairman's Speech The speech briefly states that the Republic of China is based on the spirit of equality among the five races to build a national government. The provisional constitution during the period of political tutelage is based on the principles of national freedom and equality to enhance the faith of all people. Panchen Master has always supported the Central Government and has made great efforts to study the Three Principles of the People and to publicize them as much as possible. The government has relied on him deeply, so it has specially bestowed him with a laudatory title and conferred upon him the title and seal in a grand ceremony. Today happens to be the sixth anniversary of the founding of the National Government. Recalling that the late Premier Sun Yat-sen aimed to seek universal happiness for the Chinese nation and all mankind with the doctrine of saving people, saving the country, and saving the world, so that they could jointly enjoy the benefits of the Three Principles of the People, it is hoped that the Master will vigorously promote the late Premier's great doctrine to achieve assimilation, so as to permanently lay the foundation of the Three Principles of the People and the nation, thereby living up to the government's expectations. This is what is greatly hoped for.</p>
<p>Panchen's Response Panchen has been in the East for nine years. Fortunately, our Chairman unified the North and South and laid the foundation for the country, so I was able to respectfully visit the capital and pay my respects. My private joy cannot be described. As the National Government is implementing the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings, it convened the National Assembly, and I was able to participate in the grand meeting, which was a great honor. Furthermore, I am grateful to the government for considering my humble sincerity and bestowing upon me a laudatory title. Today, I come to the government to receive it, which only increases my shame and trepidation. From now on, I will only fulfill the inherent function of religion, pray sincerely, protect the country's foundation in lasting peace, promote far-reaching cultural education, use a long tongue to translate and explain the Three Principles of the People, enlighten and awaken people's minds, and convert the Mongolian and Tibetan people through party education. I vow to devote all my loyalty to repay a drop of kindness. I humbly offer my foolish sincerity to express my thanks and sincerity.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Jiangxi Province Orders General Offensive to Suppress Bandits <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>He Yingqin Arrives in Fuzhou from Nanchang</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: After Chairman Jiang arrived in Jiangxi, arrangements for bandit suppression were already in place. The various important news items are recorded below:</p>
<p>He Yingqin Departs for Fuzhou: Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin, upon receiving orders to proceed to Fuzhou to supervise the troops, visited Jiang at the military headquarters on the morning of the 28th to seek instructions. He then went to the Provincial Government and Provincial Party Headquarters to bid farewell. At around 11 a.m., he led Chief of Staff He and other personnel from various departments, traveling in several cars, to the riverbank. They boarded a steamer to depart. Lu Diping, Xiong Shihui, Cao Haosen, all members of the Provincial Party Headquarters and Provincial Government, and representatives of various people's organizations were already at the riverbank to see him off. After He got out of the car, he shook hands with everyone present, then boarded the Qinghe steamer and set sail, heading up the Fu River towards Fuzhou. Yu Feipeng and others accompanied him. Yu was going to supervise logistics and military supplies. On the 29th, He arrived safely in Fuzhou. The date for the general offensive is expected to be soon.</p>
<p>Lai and Li Arrive in Jiangxi Together: Lai Xinhui arrived in the province from Hankou a few days ago and immediately met with Chairman Jiang to report on the situation in Yichang and Hankou, and to request instructions on matters in Sichuan. Li Mingzhong and Fang Boren have also recently arrived in Jiangxi from Hankou. After Li arrived, he reported to Jiang on the bandit situation along the borders of Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan, and requested instructions and advice. Fang came at the invitation to assist in military operations and will serve at the military headquarters.</p>
<p>Hunan Generals Arrive in Jiangxi for Instructions: Liu Jianxu, Li Jue, Tao Guang, and others arrived in Jiangxi from Hunan on the 29th. As soon as they arrived, they went to the military headquarters to meet with Jiang. Liu reported on the bandit suppression situation in Pingjiang, Liuyang, Lingxian, and Guixian, as well as the border defenses of Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, and the recent military and political situation in Hunan. Jiang expressed great satisfaction and gave them instructions. It is said that Liu and others will return to Hunan on July 2nd to report to He Jian, so that Peng Weiren and various division commanders can come to Jiangxi to receive instructions from Jiang.</p>
<p>Tu Weifan Arrested and Punished: Tu Weifan (Deputy Commander of the 52nd Division), former commander of the Nanchang Garrison and concurrently head of the Security Office, was reported to the military headquarters by the people for various illegal activities. Jiang removed Tu from all his positions and appointed Lu Diping as the garrison commander and Sun Changjun as the head of the Security Office. He also ordered the military headquarters to arrest Tu and hand him over to the military court for strict punishment in accordance with the law, to maintain military discipline and to deter others. After Lu was appointed garrison commander, he scheduled to take office on July 1st and decided to expand the organization, dividing it into four departments: staff, adjutant, detention and investigation, and law enforcement. It is said that Xie Muhan will be appointed as Chief of Staff, and Wang Shihe, the Chief of the Bodyguard of the Headquarters, will concurrently serve as the Head of the Detention and Investigation Department. Lu sent people on the 28th to take over the files and equipment of the former Garrison Headquarters.</p>
<p>Aviation Office Added to the Headquarters: At around 11 a.m. on the 26th, Huang Bingheng, Director of the Central Aviation Administration, led squadron leader Zhang Tingmeng and others to Jiangxi on the Yongke aircraft. Chairman Jiang, considering that many combat and reconnaissance aircraft have arrived in the province, and that airfields have been built in Fuzhou, Ji'an, Jiujiang, Ganzhou, and other places, has added an Aviation Office to the headquarters for the purpose of unified command. Mao Bangchu, Principal of the Aviation School, will concurrently serve as the Director of the office. Mao has come to the province from Nanjing to take office. As for the aircraft in Jiangxi, Huang Bingheng has been supervising and directing them in reconnaissance and bombing missions, which have been very effective.</p>
<p>Admonition to the People and County Magistrates: Chairman Jiang believes that this bandit suppression campaign involves the integrated use of the Party, government, and military to eliminate the root of the bandits, and that it is necessary for everyone to be of one mind and for the entire population to be mobilized to succeed. He issued an open letter to the people of Jiangxi, stating that the local gentry must stand up and take responsibility, strive for righteousness for humanity, and seek security for mankind, with one heart and one mind, eliminate the red bandits, and thereby save themselves and others. In the future, information on bandit suppression strategies, local rehabilitation, official misconduct, and military discipline can be reported to the military headquarters. Zhongzheng [Jiang] will personally review and adopt them to understand the people's sentiments. He also issued an admonishing telegram to the county magistrates, stating that the county magistrates must eliminate the habit of inertia, inspire their innate loyalty and righteousness, and resolve to survive or perish with the city. If they continue to procrastinate, or seek to preserve their lives, or abandon the city upon hearing of an alarm, they will be subject to military law and sentenced to death. Even if they flee alone, their guarantors and family members will be held accountable. (June 30)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Recent Deployment of Guangdong and Guangxi Troops <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: In Guangdong province, Li Yangjing's 3rd Army, which belongs to Chen Jitang's 1st Army Group, has recently redeployed its main forces to Shaoguan and Yingde for defense. Yu Hanmou's 1st Army, Li Zhenqiu's division, is deployed in the suburbs, up to Conghua. Ye Zhao's brigade is stationed in Huaxian Juntian, connecting with Li's forces of the 3rd Army. Zengcheng, Longmen, Dongguan, and other areas are guarded by Xiang Hanping's 2nd Army. Huizhou, Pingshan, Danshui, Sanduozhu, and other places are defended by Huang Renhuan's Independent 1st Division. However, the defense line along the Dong River is weak, with only a few regiments of the 2nd Independent Division deployed in Chaozhou and Meizhou. The military authorities have long planned to reinforce this area, but there is no suitable senior officer to take charge. Recently, Xu Chongzhi resigned and has been spending his days at Li Fulin's estate in Datang Township, Henan, indifferent to current affairs. Sun Ke and others are unwilling to see Xu idle, and discussed with Chen Jitang to appoint Xu to an important military position, providing him with a certain amount of military funds each month, so that Xu can go to the Dong River or elsewhere to reorganize his old troops and form an army as soon as possible. As for weapons, it is planned to ask Chen Jitang for a loan. However, Xu has not yet agreed to this proposal. One report says that Xu intends to rise again, and his former subordinate, Sun Benrong, has scheduled to go to a certain place to recruit his old troops. This is the latest military news from the Dong River. As for the northwest river area, Chen Jitang's troops are concentrated in the suburbs of Guangzhou. If there is trouble on the border in the future, he will need the assistance of other troops. Therefore, Li Zongren has been attending military conferences in Guangzhou for days, advocating that Guangxi should deploy some troops to Guangdong for joint defense. Chen Jitang, seeing that the war has not yet broken out, has only allowed Zhang Guiji's army to prepare to mobilize a part of its forces to the area where the Xiaobei River intersects the Guangxi border, in case of emergency. He also sent Bai Chongxi back to Guangxi first to make arrangements. After Bai returned to Guangxi, he convened a military conference in Wuzhou on the evening of the 23rd. In recent days, the Guangxi troops have been slightly mobilized. Wu Qiwai's division of Zhang Fakui's army has moved east from Pingle, and most of it is waiting for orders in Hexian. If necessary, it can enter Guangdong along the Xiaobei River through Lianxian for joint defense. Also, Qi Daozheng's regiment of Huang Heling's division of the Guangxi army, and Li Mo's regiment of Li Pinxian's army, have arrived in Wuzhou in recent days. Zhou Yuan's regiment of Huang's division has moved to Tengxian, Xu Jiangguang's regiment is stationed in Mengjiang, and Lin Maomeng and Meng Zhihong's two regiments are stationed in Pingnan. Li Fawen, Wang Zhibin, and Wei Hengxin's three regiments of Li Pinxian's division are deployed in the Da Huangjiang Guiping area. In total, there are eleven regiments of Guangxi troops concentrated in Xunwu and Wuzhou, totaling approximately 13,000 people, and Zhang Fakui's entire army, approximately 8,000 people, is concentrated in Hexian.

<p>The Creditor is a Banking Group</p>
<p>The Loan Amount is 600,000</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Since Hubei Province abolished the likin tax, the revenue from the business tax has been extremely sluggish, and the financial situation has reached a critical point. The newly appointed Director of Finance, Wu Guozhen, negotiated a large loan with the Hankou banking group. After several negotiations, a new loan of 600,000 yuan was finalized on the 29th, and a contract was signed with the Bank of China in Hankou. 100,000 silver dollars were paid immediately, and the remaining 500,000 yuan will be paid in full within the month. The loan is secured by 1.2 million yuan face value of customs tax treasury bonds and rehabilitation public bonds. The monthly interest rate is 1.2%, and the principal and interest are to be repaid from August to December, with monthly payments of 120,000 yuan allocated from the special tax agreement. As for the loan amounts from the banking group, the Provincial Bank loaned 50,000 yuan, the Bank of China 62,500 yuan, the Bank of Communications 60,000 yuan, and the Jin Cheng, Salt Industry, Continental, Central South, Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, Si Ming, and Shanghai banks each loaned 45,000 yuan. The China Industrial, Ju Xingcheng, and Guangdong banks each loaned 22,500 yuan, totaling 600,000 yuan. (June 29)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Shandong Department of Education Instructs Provincial Education Bureaus to Protect Antiquities <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Shandong is a land of culture, with numerous antiquities both above and below ground, all of which have cultural value. After the Gao family in Weixian sold all their collection of Qin and Han bricks and tiles to the Japanese, the Shandong Provincial Government, in order to preserve antiquities, and in accordance with the regulations issued by the central government, specially instructed the Weixian County Magistrate to severely reprimand them. Now, the Department of Education, in order to prevent further theft and sale of antiquities throughout the province, specifically instructed all provincial education bureaus to publicize the details of the private sale of bricks and tiles in Weixian, ordering all bureau directors to take proper care to protect antiquities, so as to prevent them from flowing overseas, and to avoid censure. The Department of Education also specially instructed the Weixian County Magistrate and the Director of the Education Bureau to severely reprimand them. The instructions are recorded as follows: Our country has the longest history, and the artifacts of each dynasty are made differently. By examining the changes in their quality and texture, we can see the order of evolution. Inscriptions on metal and stone are related to production and can be used to verify history. However, it is difficult to investigate and determine methods of preservation and it is impossible to avoid losses. The National Government has long recognized this and promulgated the Law on the Preservation of Antiquities, and this department has already transmitted it to all for compliance. The education authorities in all counties and cities should conscientiously comply with it to value antiquities. Recently, the Gao family in Weixian secretly sold seven boxes of Qin and Han bricks, tiles, and stone carvings out of the country. Fortunately, the Jiaoji Railway Bureau discovered and detained them. On June 14th, this department transported them all to Jinan from Qingdao. It was decided that on the 16th, the Provincial Government and this department would send personnel to jointly open and inspect the seal with the Director of the Provincial Library. A total of 531 pieces of bricks and tiles and 2 pieces of stone carvings were found. They have now been handed over to the Jinshi Conservation Institute of the Provincial Library for proper preservation. According to this item, these bricks and tiles were collected by the Gao family, which is quite precious. However, future generations do not know to cherish them, and sell them to foreigners, ignoring the overall situation. This is obviously wrong. The County Education Bureau did not detect it beforehand, and did not report it afterwards, and its handling of affairs was negligent. In addition to severely reprimanding the bureau director, and ordering the county magistrate to forward the reprimand to the Gao family, this is hereby ordered to be followed. In the future, ancient artifacts must be carefully protected and inspected at any time, so as to avoid losses and to pass them on forever. This is of utmost importance. This order.</p>

<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: Before the tenth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty, Xuzhoubu was the area through which the Yellow River flowed. After the Yellow River breached the levee at Tongwaxiang and moved north, Xuzhoubu was no longer plagued by floods. Therefore, the north, east, and south sides of Xuzhou city have remains of the old Yellow River embankment, which is about ten miles long. The embankment stones are huge and long, and are joined with a mixture of rice juice and ash, making them extremely strong. After the river moved, poor people gathered on the embankment, living attached to the embankment, and making it their livelihood for a long time. In recent years, the waterways have not been dredged, and during the summer rainy season, the rivers rise. The old embankment, even though it is in disrepair, is still sufficient to prevent floods. Unexpectedly, Li Enbao, the former director of the Xuzhou Property Clearance Bureau, secretly sold the old Yellow River embankment and all the official wasteland to the Jiudetang before his term ended. It has been found that the Jiudetang is a private land company organization with nine shareholders, including Lan Haiqiu, Xi Peichen, and Wang Xiangfu. A contact point was set up outside the East Gate. In recent months, disputes have arisen from the measurement of official land. Recently, Zuo Shufu, the current Director of the Property Clearance Bureau, was assisted in measuring the river embankment, causing the residents attached to the embankment to rise up and block them. They once attacked the personnel sent by the Property Bureau. On June 29th, the County Government responded to the Property</p>

<p>Bureau's letter and sent police to arrest Zhang Chuanyi and four other residents who had blocked the measurement of the embankment, and detained them in the county government. On the afternoon of the 30th, about three or four hundred men, women, old, and young, gathered from the nearby households, holding flags and braving the rain, and set off from the Yellow River embankment. They entered the West Gate via Yiqia Road and Yingshi Street, chanting slogans along the way to overthrow the Property Bureau and Jiudetang. Then they went to the county government to petition. The police team added posts in front of the gate and advised them to elect representatives. The crowd did not listen and broke into the gate in large numbers, smashing the dispatching office with bricks and stones. The police team could not stop them and fired warning shots into the air. The crowd retreated slightly, but due to the crowding, an old man was trampled to death. Seven or eight policemen were also injured by the people. Upon hearing the news, the Public Security Bureau sent more police to the scene to suppress the riot and arrested ten ringleaders. The rest of the crowd dispersed. County Magistrate Yang Wei immediately convened a meeting of local leaders on the evening of the same day to discuss solutions. It is unknown how it will be resolved. (June 30)</p>

<p>Armed Robbers Wound Accomplice: In the fifth district of the county (Tianshang City), at the home of Zuo Min Yuan Ashi in Nantangtou, yesterday (the 1st) at about 1:00 AM, five armed robbers suddenly arrived. Each held a Mauser pistol. At the time, the men and women of the Yuan family were fast asleep. One robber first climbed onto the roof of Xu Quanbao's house, intending to enter, open the main door, and let the remaining robbers inside. Xu heard the sound of tiles and knew something was amiss. He immediately went out the back door and beat a gong to alert the neighbors. The nearby Zuo villagers heard the gong and came out to capture the robbers. Seeing the situation was not good, four robbers immediately fled. The robber on the roof, seeing his accomplices escaping, panicked. He jumped off the roof and fled after them. The four robbers, suspecting that villagers were coming to catch them, immediately fired their pistols to intimidate them. Unexpectedly, a bullet struck the robber in the back. After being wounded, the robber went to Bantang Temple, lay down on a bench, bleeding profusely and barely breathing. At dawn, the Nantangtou villagers reported to the Public Security Bureau by telephone. Director Xu, upon hearing the report, immediately dispatched Detective Xue Furui and four investigators to the village to pursue the robbers. While passing Bantang Temple, they spotted a person with a gunshot wound whose appearance was suspicious. They immediately went forward to question him. He claimed his name was Qian Hai, from Tongzhou. Yesterday afternoon, he came to Wuxi from Shanghai by train. At the train station, he met four "Red Bandits" who took him to Yuan Ashi's house in Nantangtou to commit robbery, but they were unsuccessful, and he was shot. However, he did not know the names of the "Red Bandits." He claimed he was in the raw silk business. Based on his confession, Detective Xue immediately sent the wounded robber Qian Hai to the city by car and admitted him to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, the bullet entered from the right back and exited near the right breast, damaging the lungs. Whether it damaged blood vessels was still difficult to determine. The injury was quite dangerous.</p>
<p>County Court Clears Accumulated Cases: Since its establishment in February, the county court has concluded many civil and criminal cases.

Now, Hu Puan, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, has petitioned the provincial government to exchange County Magistrate Pan with the current Jiading County Magistrate Chen Chuande. This has been approved in a meeting. The provincial government will announce this in the coming days.

The land and buildings of the old Wuxi County Government were completely transferred to the court to prepare for the establishment of a local branch court. Later, some of the buildings were lent to the Second District of Water Police for office use. Since the establishment of the court, the current front and middle buildings used for trials are insufficient for office space due to the large number of lawsuits.

<p>Wu Nanxuan Resigns Due to Summer Illness, Resignation Rejected</p>
<p>Nanjing, 1st Dispatch: Wu Nanxuan, President of Tsinghua University, has repeatedly submitted his resignation since the school's turmoil. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly rejected his resignation. Recently, Wu personally came to the capital because of the heat of summer and frequent summer illnesses and went to the Ministry of Education to resign in person. Li Shuhua personally rejected Wu's resignation and instructed that he be retained. However, Wu repeatedly stated that his body was not strong enough to bear the heavy workload. Therefore, the Ministry telegraphed Weng Wenhao to temporarily act as president so that Wu could temporarily reduce the heavy workload and recuperate. The instructions to retain Wu and the telegram to appoint Weng are recorded below: First, instructions to retain Wu: We have received the report. The president of the school previously submitted his resignation, and this Ministry instructed that he be retained and ordered to continue to be responsible. Now, according to the report, he has worked hard to maintain the school for a month. The heat of summer and the frequent summer illnesses show that he values his duties and is deeply concerned. However, school affairs are important and depend on his leadership. The president has been appointed and should not be quick to retire. The claim that his body is weak and needs to be recuperated is true. The Ministry has telegraphed Weng Wenhao to temporarily act as president so that the president can temporarily reduce the heavy workload and recuperate. The request for resignation should not be discussed. The telegram to appoint Weng reads, "Tsinghua University President Wu Nanxuan continues to request resignation due to summer illnesses and inability to bear the heavy workload. This Ministry has instructed that he be retained. However, because the president's body needs to be recuperated, the school's affairs cannot be handled as usual. You are hereby ordered to send someone to temporarily act as president. You must go to the school to take office and report." Seal of the Ministry of Education.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education, according to the Zhejiang Education Department's report regarding the matter of whether to include a line in the establishment matters that reads "the spirit of Christ's sacrifice and service" for most church schools, asked for an indication of compliance etc. (The Province of Zhejiang has a total of more than forty private middle schools, of which more than ten were established by churches, including those run by foreigners. The Education Department has already followed the Regulations for Reclaiming Educational Enterprises Run by Foreigners in Zhejiang Province, formulated by the former National Zhejiang University, ordering them to be handed over to Chinese people, to organize a board of directors, and to register in accordance with the Private School Regulations. All of its curriculum must conform to the standards set by the Ministry. Religion may not be a required subject, nor may religious propaganda be carried out in classes. If there are religious ceremonies in the school, students may not be forced or encouraged to participate. Various church schools can also comply with the procedures. However, one point is difficult to resolve, that is, in the establishment matters of the board of directors of various church schools, there is the phrase "the spirit of Christ" or "the spirit of Christ's sacrifice and service". An order has been issued to amend it, and most of it has been amended. However, there are occasional claims that, because of the source of funds, they have no choice but to add this sentence.) The Ministry of Education instructed: "The report has been received. It is said that most church schools in the province are unable to remove the sentence "the spirit of Christ's sacrifice and service" under the establishment purposes because of the source of funds. However, the provincial Department recently submitted the registration form for the Private Yuecai Junior Middle School, which has been amended in compliance with the Ministry's order. The registration form for the Junde Girls' Junior Middle School does not contain the above-mentioned sentence. The difficult situation mentioned in the report should no longer be a problem. You should still examine the situation of each school and enact a law to make them delete the sentence in order to be consistent, and report the handling situation."</p>

The Japanese players' astonishing accuracy resulted in another 6-2 victory. Indian Kerajef's serve was the only way to score points, but the Japanese players' baseline attacks made the Indian players flee far away.</p>

<p>Scheduled During the National Games</p>
<p>National Rankings to be Determined Simultaneously</p>
<p>Chinese tennis has been lacking in vitality recently, and few promising new players have emerged. The reason for this is that there are very few competitions, and good talent is buried. More importantly, there are no national tennis rankings to date. No one knows who is the best player. Two years ago, during the Qiu Lin competition, disputes arose suddenly. Those who supported Lin said that Lin should be the top player, while those who supported Qiu said that Qiu was the champion of the competition. Therefore, according to unofficial sources, those in charge of tennis competitions are currently planning to hold a national tennis tournament as a matter of urgency. However, the time around the National Games is most suitable, as players from all regions are gathered in one place, which is convenient for both. At the same time, the rankings of national tennis players will be determined.</p>

<p>(Photo by Wang Kai) Opening Ceremony of the 7th Shanghai Municipal Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered the opening address, stating, in brief: Central representatives, representatives of various organizations, esteemed guests, and comrades, today the 7th Shanghai Special Municipality Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party holds its opening ceremony here. Regarding the future progress of Party affairs, it is certain there will be a great deal of contribution. Looking back since the closing of the 6th Municipal Congress, it has been over a year. It was originally stipulated that the Municipal Congress should be held annually. However, due to the Central Government convening a National Conference in May this year, and the busy situation of Party affairs in Shanghai, it was unavoidably postponed until now to convene the Congress. This point must first be explained to all representatives. We feel that in the past year, the situation of Party affairs in this city has both areas that can bring comfort to all representatives and comrades, and areas that should prompt all comrades in the city to be extremely cautious and apprehensive in the future. What can bring us comfort is that in the past year, the Party, the government, and the people were able to cooperate and cope with the difficult environment, maintaining a stable order in the city. Nationally speaking, in the past year, the rampant reaction of warlords and the harassment of the Red bandits can be said to be unprecedented since the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army. Our Central Government, based on the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, adhering to the principles of our Party, and responding to the people of the whole country, on the one hand, issued a clear order to suppress them, and finally completely eliminated the forces of the reactionary clique, corrected the fragmented and disjointed situation, and completed the great cause of unification again. Then, it devoted all its efforts to the work of suppressing the Red bandits. Shanghai can be said to be a gathering place for reactionary elements. Considering industry and commerce, it is not only the national center but also has very complex international relations. In terms of administration, because the unequal treaties have not yet been abolished and the concessions have not yet been recovered, the progress of all municipal facilities is obstructed everywhere. Fortunately, all comrades in the city were able to work together with one heart and one mind, the Party and the government were able to cooperate, and the Party and the people were able to get along harmoniously. The Party, the government, and the people were able to stand united under the leadership of the Central Government and work together, so that in the past year, the local order was relatively stable, and although industry and commerce were depressed, they did not completely collapse. The Central Government was able to suppress the rebels in the front without being affected in the slightest by the rear in Shanghai. This is the result of the efforts of all Party members and people in the city, and it is also what can make us feel somewhat comforted. However, from another perspective, if we want the Party and the country to be in long-term peace and stability, merely preventing disturbances in a passive way is not a fundamental solution. We must strive for construction work in an active way so that the people can obtain real benefits, only then will there be a solid foundation. In the past, although the Party, the government, and the people were able to cooperate quite well, it seems that they were not able to do so thoroughly enough. This is a point that we should be cautious and apprehensive about and work hard on in the future, to ensure that the Party and the government, the Party and the people in this city are completely united, laying a very solid foundation for construction undertakings. For example, in local autonomy, the citizens still need considerable training. The government should of course take on the responsibility of training, but Party members should also work harder. In any case, we want the people to accept the Party's principles, to be able to exercise the four powers, and to be able to understand the purpose of community-run local autonomy. Only in this way can there be achievements to speak of. Another example is the planned progress of the central urban area, which the municipal government has already decided on, but Party comrades must also assist the government and work hard to promote it to the people, so that the people can understand its great significance and use their spiritual abilities to cooperate with the government, and the construction of the central urban area can be completed as soon as possible. Only when the Party, the government, and the people of this city fully cooperate can they assist the Central Government in completing the great cause of construction during the period of political tutelage. When the Party, the government, and the people can unite and cooperate fully, no matter big or small matters, all internal construction work, the abolition of unequal treaties, and the recovery of concessions, etc., can be accomplished without problems. In the past year, although there was considerable connection between the Party, the government, and the people, it has not reached the point of being sensitive. Reactionary elements must hope that we cannot cooperate fully, only then will they have an opportunity to take advantage of. Therefore, to what extent the Party, the government, and the people can cooperate is the standard for how successful the construction will be in the future. This is what all our comrades should be extremely cautious, apprehensive, and work hard to do. Today, all of you comrades are holding a meeting here. I hope that the central representatives will provide detailed guidance, so that everyone can inherit the Central Government's spirit and work hard for the Party and the country.</p>
<p>Central Instruction: Central Representative Zhang Qun delivered an instruction, stating, in brief: Chairman and representatives, today the Chinese Nationalist Party of the Shanghai Special Municipality is holding its Seventh Municipal Congress. As the highest administrative official of the area, I was originally going to represent the Municipal Government to make a municipal report, but last night I received a telegram from the Secretariat of the Central Committee, saying that I was instructed by the Standing Committee to represent the Central Committee to give a speech today. Therefore, I am now setting aside my position as the local administrative official and first representing the Central Committee to give a speech. Since the Sixth Municipal Congress of the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters, a year has passed. According to the provisions of the general charter, the Seventh Congress should be held. The powers of the Congress are no more than three points: (1) To accept and adopt the reports of the Municipal Executive and Supervisory Committees and various organizations; (2) To decide on the strategies for the Party affairs of this city; (3) To elect the members of the Municipal Executive and Supervisory Committees. As for how to adopt the reports of various organizations and how to decide on the strategies for the Party affairs of this city, the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and the various resolutions passed by the Central Committee before and after should of course be taken as the standards. What has already been done should be further promoted and developed. For what has not been done, for the sake of preventing further losses, the work should be stepped up. According to the previous intentions entrusted by the Central Government, the Party affairs of the Shanghai Special Municipality have a relatively long history and good achievements. In the negative aspect, eliminating reactionaries has been done with all efforts. In the positive aspect, propagating the ideology has been done deeply among the people. This is especially commendable. If it were not for the loving and sincere spirit of the thousands of Party members in the city, united as one and fighting together, how could this have been achieved? I remember the speech of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen at the First National Congress of our Party, saying that the spirit of a political party lies in all the members and in the leaders, and that the struggle of Party members is the same as the struggle of the army. The spirit of all comrades in the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters is close to this. Today's achievements are by no means accidental. The adverse environment in Shanghai, where people from all directions gather, is definitely beyond what other places can match. As the Chairman said, the concessions are a place where filth is hidden and reactionary elements gather and stir up trouble. This is enough to endanger the Party and the country. Therefore, before the extraterritoriality is abolished and the concessions are recovered, our comrades must work even harder to achieve great results. According to the population survey report of this city, the population of this city has reached 3.15 million. With such a large population, the number of Party members compared to the population is actually a small minority. Moreover, Shanghai is a major center of economy, culture, industry, and commerce, and a place where talented people gather. There is no lack of virtuous people. For the sake of believing in the Party's principles, for enriching the Party's quality and strength, and for completing political tutelage, the recruitment of construction talents is not to be delayed. The Central Government also hopes for this very much. I hope that the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters will pay special attention to the introduction of Party members during the recruitment. The future of the Party and the country truly depends on this. More than two years have passed since the closing of the Third National Congress. At that time, in the administrative aspect, the administrative policies and programs were determined based on the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. In the military aspect, a plan was also formulated for the creation of troops. Unfortunately, the reactionary warlords attempted to possess the army and become independent. Not only was the creation of troops impossible, but they also rebelled, causing all administrative policies to be impossible to realize. This is truly regrettable. Therefore, the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of our Party that have been realized in the past two years are truly shameful to speak of. However, we cannot stop doing things because of difficulties. We should work even harder because of the difficulties. The Fourth National Congress will be held three months later. This is giving us an opportunity to review the past preparations. I hope that all representatives of the city will pay attention to this together with all comrades in the city. This is what the Central Government and I hope for.</p>
<p>Various Reports: After the Central Representative's instruction, various reports were made. The details are recorded as follows: (Party Affairs Report) Municipal Executive Committee Representative Pan Gongzhan gave a report on Party affairs in the past year, stating in brief: Today, this city is holding the Seventh Municipal Congress.

<h3 id="e112">Navy Impounds Customs Vessels <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>…Reasons… (1) Recovering Hydrographic Survey Rights</p>
<p>(2) Customs Detains Navy Materials</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jianghai Customs surveying patrol vessels, "Liuxing," "Jinghai," "Jinghui," and "Jingguang," were impounded by the navy's "Datong" warship at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday and escorted to Gaochangmiao port for berthing. As of 5 p.m. yesterday, they had not been released. A reporter from the Guowenshe news agency went to investigate and met with Navy Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan, obtaining the following detailed record of the impoundment:</p>
<p>"Datong" Goes to Impound. Guowenshe reports that the "Datong" warship, stationed at Gaochangmiao port in Shanghai, received an order from the Naval Ministry on June 19 to impound all Jianghai Customs patrol vessels. The "Datong" immediately set sail with the "Yixian" warship at 1 p.m. on the 30th. The "Yixian" sailed directly to Xiangshan, while the "Datong" sailed to the Huangpu River near Zhaofeng Road. Upon seeing the patrol vessel "Liuxing," it immediately impounded it. At the time, the crew of the "Liuxing," caught off guard and unaware of the reason, could only obey orders. After the "Datong" sent soldiers to escort the "Liuxing" back to Gaochangmiao port, the "Datong" sailed to the river in front of the Ruirong Shipyard and berthed. At that time, the three patrol vessels "Jinghui," "Jinghai," and "Jingguang" saw the "Datong" berthed in a busy area for vessels and, as usual, went to notify it and planned to moor alongside to inquire about the impoundment of the "Liuxing." Unexpectedly, soldiers from the "Datong" boarded the vessels and escorted them to Gaochangmiao together. Therefore, a total of four patrol vessels were impounded and were all berthed in the river in front of the Gaochangmiao Naval Shipyard yesterday. The reporter hailed a ferry to the "Liuxing" and inquired with the crew, who also claimed not to know the reason, only answering that all matters should be inquired at the Customs. The reporter, unable to get to the bottom of it, returned to inquire with the crew of the "Jinghai," who only said that it was about the issue of survey rights. (Also, Huadongshe reports) "Datong" Captain Meng Xiuchun and Deputy Captain Zheng Zhenqian, at 1 p.m. the day before yesterday, led the Jiangnan small vessel from the Jiangnan Shipyard to Yangshupu. At that time, the Customs Marine Department's patrol vessel "Liuxing" was berthed there, about to sail to outside the Wusongkou at 4 p.m. to survey Shentan Shoal. Meng and Zheng immediately sent "Datong" Second Officer Xu Bingjun and He Hui to the "Liuxing" to meet with its captain, ordering it to sail to Gaochangmiao. Because the captain was not there, the other crew members refused to set sail, so the Jiangnan small steamer towed it south, entering the Huangpu River. The Customs River Department's small vessels "Jinghai," "Jingguang," and "Jinghui" also followed on their own. Four or five Westerners from "Jinghai" even boarded the "Datong" to inquire about the reasons. Because Meng and others also did not know the details, after arriving at Gaochangmiao at around 4 p.m., the Westerners went to see First Fleet Commander Chen Jiliang to inquire about everything. Also not knowing the details, they then left. The above, etc., was all talked about by "Datong" Deputy Captain Zheng. Deputy Captain Zheng also said that the "Datong's" internal repairs should be completed within three or four days, and once completed, it must sail to the capital, etc.</p>
<p>Customs Patrol Vessels. Guowenshe reports that the Customs has more than 20 surveying and patrol vessels. The surveying vessels include "Liuxing," "Haixing," "Zhuantiao," "Lijin," and "Pingjin." Except for "Pingjin," which is not often in Shanghai, the other four vessels travel between the Huangpu River in Songhu and sometimes go to Tongchong, Jianghuai, and other places. These vessels are all under the jurisdiction of the Customs Marine Department. The remaining smaller patrol vessels include "Jinghui," "Jingguang," "Jinghai," "Jingheng," and more than 10 others, specializing in patrolling and inspecting merchant vessels in the Huangpu River, under the jurisdiction of the Customs Shipping Office, only in the Huangpu River section, not going outside the mouth. All patrol vessels have existed since the establishment of the Customs and have not changed to this day. The treaty for them was established by Li Hongzhang in the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>Chen Shaokuan's Discussion. Subsequently, a Guowenshe reporter learned that Navy Vice Minister and Jiangnan Shipyard Director Chen Shaokuan had arrived in Shanghai in the morning. The reporter met with Chen at the shipyard and asked about the previous events. According to Chen, the navy once had the establishment of a hydrographic survey bureau for hydrographic surveys, without the need for Customs surveys. Now, the Customs is overstepping its bounds and acting as an agent, which is infringing on our sovereignty. Therefore, today's impoundment of its patrol vessels is one reason. Other reasons are that the navy has been building warships for many years, and most of its materials are purchased from overseas. Several times when materials arrived in Shanghai, they were detained by the Customs, demanding taxes. Warships are owned by the state, and the Customs is the Chinese Customs, but they are so unreasonable. Even at that time, the navy paid taxes as required because its materials were not released. At that time, the foreign Customs officials still ignored it and delayed it, which was extremely deceiving. Now, they want to detain our materials and hinder our navy's construction, so we impound their surveying patrol vessels. Moreover, surveying rivers and seas is Chinese sovereignty and should be recovered. This is the second reason. At this point, the reporter asked about future arrangements and whether anyone from the Customs had come to negotiate. Chen replied that no one from the Customs had come. The foreigners from the "Liuxing" disembarked at Gaochangmiao and returned as soon as the vessel was impounded. As for future arrangements, the impounded vessel is a surveying vessel, and our navy already has a surveying bureau, which can be transferred to the bureau for management. In terms of personnel, one more vessel requires employment, which is not a difficult matter. After the discussion, Chen determined that he had to take a merchant vessel to Xiangshan at 5 p.m. for inspection and then said goodbye.</p>
<p>Foreign Staff Negotiations. According to a Huadongshe reporter's discussion with Chen Shixia, a Chinese assistant at the Customs Marine Department, after this incident occurred, Harryman, a British staff member of the Customs Marine Department, not understanding the matter, immediately went with him to the Gaochangmiao First Fleet Command to negotiate. Chen Jiliang received them, saying that he was ordered to handle it and did not know the reasons for the impoundment in detail, but promised to immediately telegraph the Naval Ministry to request instructions on the matter. Harryman and others were satisfied and returned.</p>
<p>Both Departments Express. Regarding the impoundment of the four vessels, a Huadongshe reporter revisited Gullen, a British staff member of the Customs River Department. According to Gullen, the three small vessels of the department that were impounded usually patrolled the Huangpu River surface, and the reasons for the Naval Ministry's impoundment were not known. At the moment, the department has reported the detailed process to the Inspectorate General of Customs for review and handling. Chen Shixia also said that the "Liuxing" patrol vessel is used by the department to patrol overseas lighthouses and transport grain. The reasons for this impoundment were also not known and have been reported to the Inspectorate General of Customs for handling. Gullen and Chen firmly stated at the time that the Marine Department and the River Department were completely unrelated to the Shentan Shoal dredging matter and that this impoundment may be a misunderstanding. The actions of the crew of the impounded vessels were also very free.</p>
<p>Song Ziliang's Discussion. A Huadongshe reporter then visited Song Ziliang, director of the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, at the National Goods Bank to inquire about the content of the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau's Shentan Shoal dredging and why a dispute occurred with the Naval Ministry. According to Song, he knew nothing about this matter. The Huangpu Conservancy Bureau's Shentan Shoal dredging was for the purpose of developing maritime commerce, approved by the Executive Yuan, and everything was being carried out in conjunction with the Naval Ministry. The Customs' four vessel impoundment had nothing to do with the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, and the impounded vessels had not received any orders from the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau to survey Shentan Shoal. Therefore, it is rumored that the Naval Ministry's impoundment is related to the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, but he has heard nothing about it and believes that it may be another matter, not related to the Shentan Shoal matter, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Maritime Affairs Administration Established Yesterday <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Director Shen Speaks on the Responsibilities of the Maritime Affairs Administration</p>
<p>Encouraging Colleagues to Unite to Seek Development</p>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Administration was formally established yesterday, and Director Xi Dingmo officially arrived at the administration to take office. The first administrative meeting was held at 2 p.m. The various situations are recorded below.</p>
<p>Establishment Situation (1) Stand at attention, (2) Sing the Party song, (3) Bow to the Party-State flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, (4) Respectfully read Sun Yat-sen's will, (5) Silent mourning, (6) Director's speech, (7) Staff speech, (8) Ceremony complete.</p>
<p>Director's Speech Briefly stating that the administration was established by order of the Ministry of Communications to manage maritime affairs in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The purpose of the Ministry of Communications in establishing the Maritime Affairs Administration is that our country has historically not paid enough attention to maritime rights, resulting in foreign vessels overstepping their bounds and infringing on our territorial waters. The reason for this is the lack of a specialized management agency. Therefore, at the time of recovering maritime rights, the Ministry of Communications specially established the Maritime Affairs Administration for management, and the importance of its responsibilities can be seen here. However, because of the importance of its responsibilities, it is necessary to implement the spirit and devote all efforts to it in order to achieve results. It is even more important that there are always three types of talented people in society. The first type of talented people do not need to be pushed to act. If they believe that something is their duty, they can do it item by item without waiting for others to direct them. The second type of talented people act only after being pushed. This type of talented people must wait for others to direct them before doing anything and cannot act on their own. The worst type of talented people are those who do not act even when pushed. This type of person not only cannot act on their own but also refuses to act even after being directed. Therefore, it is hoped that all colleagues in the administration will be the first type of talented people who do not need to be pushed to act. There are four points that are expected of all colleagues in terms of service: First, be able to endure hardship. Only those who are persevering, not avoiding difficulties, have the hope of success. Otherwise, retreating will not lead to success. In the future, the administration's work, such as surveying and inspection, must be done without fear of cold and heat. Second, be incorruptible. Public officials should be incorruptible first and foremost, especially in the prosperous area of Shanghai, where dirty things are often heard of. It is hoped that all colleagues in the administration will restrain themselves, advocate thrift, and maintain a pure and unyielding personality. Third, be obedient. No matter what kind of organization, there is always a division of ranks in the system. It is necessary for everyone to be of one mind, with arms and fingers responding to each other, section members obeying section chiefs, and section chiefs obeying the director, so that everything can be done and there is no conflict of duties, and things can be carried out in a unified system. This is another thing that is hoped of all colleagues. Fourth, be studious. The world is changing rapidly, and it is necessary to study at any time to avoid falling behind. All the administration's affairs are specialized knowledge, and this kind of mechanical progress is often a thousand miles away. Therefore, it is hoped that all colleagues will not only gain experience at any time but also study their knowledge to seek progress. The above is only a general outline. It is hoped that all colleagues will invigorate their spirits, unite, and develop our country's shipping industry, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Municipal Treasury Established Yesterday <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Treasury was formally established at 1 p.m. yesterday. The location is on the second floor of the Nanshi Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Bank near Minguo Road and Xinkai River. The various situations are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Ceremony Order (1) Stand at attention, (2) Sing the Party song, (3) Bow to Sun Yat-sen's portrait and the Party-State flag, (4) Chairman respectfully read Sun Yat-sen's will, (5) Silent mourning, (6) Treasury Director and staff bow to each other, (7) Treasury Director's speech, (8) Guest speeches, (9) Ceremony complete.</p>
<p>Treasury Director's Speech Treasury Director Zhou briefly said that the treasury was established directly by order of the municipal government and has nothing to do with the Finance Bureau. As for the treasury's business, it specializes in the city's revenue and expenditure and financial matters. At the same time, it is hoped that all colleagues will be loyal to their responsibilities, so as not to fail the municipal government's trust, etc. Guest speakers then gave speeches, mostly encouraging (speech omitted).</p>
<p>Internal Treasury Organization The office is divided into two sections: one is the accounting section, with Zhu Ming designated as the section chief, and the other is the cashier section, with the section chief yet to be determined. Before a suitable candidate is found, Director Zhou will temporarily act as the agent. The total number of staff in the treasury is more than 20.</p>
<p>Zhou's Brief Biography Treasury Director Zhou Xin, style name Yanmin, is 44 years old. He graduated from the former Anglo-American College. In the first year of the Republic, he followed Sun Yat-sen in the revolution and successively served as the third section chief of the Ministry of Communications' Telegraph Administration, the material section chief of the Shanghai Arsenal, the assistant secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the fourth section chief of the Municipal Finance Bureau, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Foreign Vessels Not Sailing to Putuo <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Customs Refuses to Issue Ship Certificates</p>
<p>Taigu Refunds Tickets Yesterday</p>
<p>Prohibition The British company Taigu specially planned to open the Shanghai-Putuo route this year and has designated the Shanghai-Ningbo line vessel "Xin Beijing" to start the first voyage from tomorrow, scheduled for a total of eight voyages, departing from Shanghai every Friday, arriving in Putuo at noon on Saturday, and sailing back on Sunday. After this matter was announced, the Shanghai-Ningbo Steamboat Tea Room Association telegraphed the Ministry of Communications, requesting a stop to it. The Ministry of Communications forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance, instructing the Jianghai Customs to refuse the foreign vessel's unauthorized entry into the interior. The Jianghai Customs notified the Taigu company that the "Xin Beijing" vessel could only sail to Ningbo as usual. Putuo is not a treaty port and cannot be sailed to. If the vessel sails without authorization, the Customs will stop issuing export ship certificates. The Taigu company, unable to accommodate the facts, completely canceled the proposal to open the Putuo route.</p>
<p>Ticket Refund This time, Taigu's opening of the Putuo route was in response to foreign requests. It was originally planned to limit the number of foreign passengers to 30 each time, with each first-class ticket sold for 50 yuan. In recent days, many Westerners in Shanghai have pre-purchased tickets and reserved seats from the company. Since sailing is not allowed, the company refunded the sold Putuo tickets to the passengers yesterday and explained the reasons for the refund and the situation of not being allowed to sail. The act of foreign vessels entering the interior without authorization has been invisibly dispelled. Many Westerners who want to go to Putuo are now mostly taking "Xin Jiangtian," etc., instead.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Church Property Guaranteed <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Explanation</p>
<p>Shanghai Catholic Progress Association Chairman Lu Bohong, in view of the fact that after the government announced the Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Church Property, various provinces, cities, and counties occasionally misunderstood the articles, causing disputes over church property, Lu went to Beijing the day before yesterday to meet with Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, presented everything in person, and requested an interpretation of the meaning of Article 5 of the regulations. He has now obtained the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' instructions that the church property of various churches, purchased before the announcement of the provisional regulations, is not bound by the provisions of the regulations. The regulations refer to those who purchase land and real estate after the announcement and are subject to the above provisions, etc. The original presentation and instructions are attached below.</p>
<p>Presentation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs In order to request an interpretation of the articles, protect church property, and maintain good deeds and peaceful religious affairs. It is observed that churches of various countries have established hospitals, schools, orphanages, etc., in the interior, all based on the purpose of philanthropy, widely practicing charity, guiding the people, and greatly benefiting the world and people's hearts. However, the enterprise must rely on expenses to maintain itself. Property is the source of funds. All the churches in various places previously purchased real estate in the interior. Except for hospitals, schools, orphanages, etc., for their own use, the income part is still to maintain the vitality of the businesses they created and to subsidize them for a long time, without any other purpose. Everyone knows it. Freedom of religion is enshrined in the Party constitution and the provisional law. Universal love and equality are the spirit of Sun Yat-sen's revolution. There is no conflict between missionary work and the Three Principles of the People. The church property of various churches should be under the protection of the government. Recently, it has been heard that in various provinces, cities, and counties, ignorant people have caused misunderstandings because they saw that the Ministry's issued Uniform Measures for Foreign Churches in the Interior to Rent Land and Buildings, Article 5, which stated that foreign churches renting land, building or renting houses in the interior, if it is found to have income or business purposes, the governing officials may prohibit it or revoke its lease, etc., which inevitably causes misunderstandings from time to time, taking the opportunity to make things difficult for the church, or even illegally interfering with and disposing of the church property previously purchased. If this continues, it will have a bad impact on both the people and the church. It is observed that the law does not pursue the past, which is the universal rule of the world. The above measures issued by the Ministry were shown to the Minister by the Holy See's representative, Archbishop Gangda, when he paid a visit to the Ministry the year before last. It was clearly stated at the time that only the rental of real estate by the church after the issuance of the articles would be subject to the regulations. The property purchased before the articles were issued would still be allowed to be managed as before, etc. It is requested that the Ministry explain the above articles in detail, so that there will be no more misunderstandings of the articles and encroachment on church property, in order to maintain good deeds and pacify the people and the church. It is appropriate to prepare a document and request the Minister to review and implement it. It is convenient for the public. Respectfully presented to Wang, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, and Lu Bohong, Chairman of the Shanghai Catholic Progress Association.</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Instructions The presentation has been noted. Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations on the Rental of Land and Buildings by Foreign Churches in the Interior, which states that foreign churches renting land, building or renting houses in the interior, if it is found to have income or business purposes, the governing officials may prohibit it or revoke its lease, etc., refers to the land and buildings rented by the church after the announcement of the provisional regulations. There have been misunderstandings of this article in other provinces, and the Ministry has explained them on several occasions. Let them know. This instruction.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Domestic Goods Market Proceeding with Methods <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Market Will Raise Another 250,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Plan to Recommend Fang Jiaobo as the Preparation Director</p>
<p>The domestic goods market's methods are being discussed.</p>
<p>Proceeding Methods The Chinese directors of the Municipal Council, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, the municipal government advisor, Wu Jingxiong, the co-organizer, He Dekui, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiaolai, the committee member, Fang Jiaobo, and the market liaison committee members have discussed the results for days, and the methods are said to be (1) raise 30,000 taels to maintain the living expenses of the domestic goods market staff before it opens, (2) the market must strengthen its organization. It has been decided to raise another 250,000 yuan in capital, reorganize, and seek new development to comfort social expectations. Preparations are now underway, and it is planned to recommend Fang Jiaobo as the preparation director, (3) the market has been ordered to close by the Municipal Council, and is awaiting the municipal government's negotiations.</p>
<p>Letter to Chinese Directors The domestic goods market liaison committee sent a letter to the Municipal Council's Chinese directors, Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng, yesterday, saying, Dear sirs, since our market was illegally sealed by the Municipal Council on June 9, public opinion across the country has been indignant. The Municipal Council is an agency for handling municipal affairs in the concession. Its duty is to protect the safety and security of citizens and to cooperate with the development of industry and commerce. The personnel employed are all supported by the taxpayers. Now, their personnel only know that there are Westerners who pay taxes and disregard the rights of our majority of Chinese taxpayers. Cases of robbery are heard every day, and most of the victims are Chinese. This is the fact of past neglect of duty. Now, it is even worse, and they dare to use illegal methods to infringe on the security of our Chinese taxpayers' businesses and destroy our plans to develop industry and commerce. To infer their intentions, there are other purposes. After reading the newspapers, we heard that the bureau asked the gentlemen to take up the investigation and find a way to mediate. After the gentlemen came to inspect, the bureau adopted the gentlemen's suggestions and asked the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to invite both parties to report the facts so that the Western directors attending could understand the truth and set a method. Our association believed that they respected the powers of our Chinese directors and the status of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and also hoped that they would reform themselves. We looked at the effects afterward. Unexpectedly, after 19 years, Brown, the representative of the bureau, had an appointment with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in a letter dated June 22 (Monday), but has not done so to this day. The bureau has already infringed on our national legal rights, and then dared to despise the goodwill of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. They treat the Chinese directors as toys. Now, after a careful study of the facts before and after the event, it is discovered that the bureau's actions are being manipulated by others. Before and after the event, there are strict organizations. Five copies of the report are attached, as well as the seven conditions submitted to the municipal government. Please check them in detail and urge the bureau to set a method within 48 hours, otherwise, we will only use a consistent and calm attitude to seek self-defense, so as to seek justice and security. There is now a request to the gentlemen that the gentlemen use their position as leaders of the Chinese taxpayers and social organizations to maintain the livelihood of the 600 employees of our market who have been unemployed and the progress of our market's affiliated civilian sales organization, and to strive to provide relief so that the more than 600 enthusiastic patriotic employees can be free from the worry of running out of food, and the poor people who are suffering and have no one to turn to can not lose the opportunity to survive. We have long admired the gentlemen for their concern for helping the poor and relieving the needy, and we hope that they can grant our request. We sincerely speak and await your reply.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Petition of Manufacturers in the Domestic Goods Market <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The domestic goods market manufacturers association sent representatives yesterday, Hu Shengyao, Liu Zhongying, Tang Rongqin, and Zhou Zhaolin, to the municipal government, the municipal chamber of commerce, the Chinese taxpayers association, and other places to hold letters of petition. The letter said, Dear sirs, the case of the sealing of the domestic goods market has been fortunately affirmed by your righteous words. It is very impressive to see the maintenance of domestic goods. We admire you very much. However, our association has something to say and dares to tell your association. The organization of the domestic goods market is originally divided into two parts: one part is the market's own management, and the other part is the rental by domestic goods factories. At the beginning of the old city hall, almost all were rented by manufacturers. After several reorganizations, the position of manufacturers renting is still more than the position of the market's own management. In May of this year, more than 20 manufacturers rented when moving into the New World, and the fees charged reached more than 2,000 yuan per month, and rent deposits were paid. The business run by the market itself only accounts for one-third of the manufacturers. This time, unfortunately, the Municipal Council ordered the closure due to the equipment problems of the market's attached amusement department. In terms of law and reason, the Municipal Council's handling is indeed inappropriate, but the manufacturers are jointly liable because of their status as tenants, so who will bear the responsibility? Moreover, the manufacturers' participation in the market was originally for the purpose of uniting. Now that misfortune has occurred, for the sake of mutual assistance, the manufacturers have always maintained a whole attitude and dared not make a statement rashly. However, the market has not indicated how far the negotiations have gone and how the manufacturers' losses will be resolved. It is not known that the organization of the market is called for by the United National Goods Factory, and its income is also mainly from manufacturers' rent (this refers to the market, the amusement department should be discussed separately), so-called business losses, since the manufacturers suffered a double one. The outside world does not know, thinking that the manufacturers are insignificant - this is indeed ignorant of its content. Now, we sincerely declare to your association and earnestly request that you uphold justice and provide relief for the manufacturers' losses. For the sake of self-defense, the manufacturers have decided to open a meeting and decide not to rashly operate without a proper method, so as not to shame domestic goods.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Chinese Merchants' Gauze Exchange Celebrates its Tenth Anniversary Yesterday <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Merchants' Gauze Exchange. The exchange was adorned with congratulatory gifts of utensils, calligraphy, and banners from various Shanghai institutions and organizations. A commemorative ceremony was held at 10:00 AM, presided over by Chairman Mu. After ceremonial procedures, Mr. Guo, representative of the Minister of Industry, delivered a speech, as did Mr. Qin, representing the Mayor of Shanghai, and Mr. Xu, the administrator of the Exchange. Guest Mr. Wang Xiaolai spoke on behalf of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, followed by congratulatory speeches from representatives of the brokers' association and agents. The Chairman then offered thanks, and the meeting adjourned for refreshments. In the afternoon, Kunqu opera was performed at the Great Eastern Restaurant, and in the evening, a banquet was held for the guests, creating a grand occasion. The speeches are appended below.</p>
<p>Minister Kong's Congratulatory Speech: Today marks the tenth anniversary of the Chinese Merchants' Gauze Exchange. I was honored to be invited, but due to pressing official duties, I have delegated Director Guo to attend on my behalf and offer my sentiments in writing to express my congratulations. The Exchange's purpose is to stabilize market prices and regulate supply and demand. In this era of intense commercial warfare, there is a large volume of commodities moving in and out, making a centralized trading market essential to facilitate equitable distribution. Commodity exchanges play this role. In Western countries, the daily market conditions of exchanges are often used as indicators of the national economy's health, demonstrating their immense importance. China's exchange system originated during the First World War.</p>
<p>As prices soared and imports sharply declined, new domestic industries emerged, and commodity exchanges arose in response. The Chinese Merchants' Gauze Exchange is a prime example. Established ten years ago, it has persevered through frequent internal conflicts, commercial decline, and crises in the textile industry, standing tall, leading the market, and contributing significantly to economic and social development with its steadfast spirit. In human terms, ten years old is still infancy, requiring nurturing. Since an exchange's lifespan can far exceed the century of human life, these ten years are just the beginning of its development. Yet, the achievements so far are already remarkable. Future progress, advancing rapidly, should allow it to surpass the exchanges of London and New York. This is my wish. However, I must also add that, as the Western saying goes, "Only steady steps ensure safety." The exchange organization holds the commercial nexus, so its stability is crucial for the national economy's prosperity. Furthermore, China's textile industry is a pillar of modern industry, requiring support amid current market instability. Should the exchange's operations be careless, leading to market crises, China's nascent industry will suffer a setback. I hope those in charge recognize the significance of their mission and approach it with utmost care. They should strive in three areas: first, standardize transactions and regulate trading to curb excessive speculation; second, carefully assess trading conditions to ensure fair and equitable market prices; and third, offer special insights to guide merchants and promote the development of the industry. These points, based on my limited perspective, are presented for consideration. If they are deemed useful and implemented, then twenty, thirty, or even a hundred years from now, we may look back on today's words and assess the future achievements. This would not only be a blessing for Xiangxi, but would also benefit the nation's commercial and industrial enterprises.</p>
<p>Mu Ouchu's Speech: Our Exchange was established on July 1, the tenth year of the Republic of China. Today marks its tenth anniversary. Over these ten years, with the guidance of government officials, the support of clients, the cooperation of brokers, and the collective efforts of our staff, we have reached this commemorative day. Today, on behalf of the Exchange, I sincerely welcome and thank you all for your guidance, support, cooperation, and efforts over the past decade. At the Exchange's inception, I discussed its nature, responsibilities, and functions with you. The Exchange's nature is to act as an agent for buying and selling. The most important point is that neither the Exchange itself nor its employees should engage in any trading beyond acting as agents. Both buyers and sellers must provide margin deposits. Regardless of market fluctuations, the Exchange itself should not incur any risk. The Exchange's responsibility is to safeguard deposits and cautiously extend loans. The Exchange's large capital is solely for guaranteeing the credit of both buyers and sellers and should not be used except for operational expenses. Additionally, margin deposits, additional margin deposits, and special margin deposits generate substantial revenue, making safekeeping crucial. These funds must be deposited in reputable banks and financial institutions and not used for personal favors. The Exchange's function is to stabilize market prices and ensure credit. Anyone can buy or sell by providing margin deposits, preventing market manipulation. Margin calls and special margin calls further secure operations. If someone fails to fulfill a contract, penalties are enforced according to the operating rules. Brokers also provide security deposits. Thus, the Exchange's credit protection is virtually foolproof, unless parties violate regulations. Looking back over the past decade, Shanghai saw a wave of exchange openings, reaching a peak of 147, but only six remain, less than 5%. The rest have been eliminated. In these ten years, our Exchange has strived daily to uphold regulations and preserve credit. Consequently, despite severe market turbulence and intense competition, we have remained independent and celebrate this tenth anniversary. This is something I can proudly report to you. However, as global transportation becomes faster and commercial competition intensifies, our cotton yarn market is not only a benchmark for Shanghai. Due to telecommunications, cotton yarn trading across China is influenced by the Exchange's price fluctuations. The Hankou Cotton Industry Association sends daily telegrams reporting the Exchange's opening and closing prices as a basis for negotiations, a prime example. Therefore, our staff must strive even harder to comply with government laws and the Exchange's regulations as a daily guide. This will directly strengthen the Exchange's credit, ensure operational safety, and indirectly promote the standardized development of cotton yarn trading, eliminating foreign monopoly. Today, on our tenth anniversary, we are honored by your presence. I have outlined the Exchange's past decade and its future aspirations as a self-reminder for our staff and to seek your guidance.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Assassination Case in Shuyuan <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Victim: Wang Shunong</p>
<p>Around 9:00 PM last night, inside House No. 3, Lane, near the Huolun Mill on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, a young man in Western attire was shot and killed in a sudden assassination. The details are as follows: Li Haiyun, a 45-year-old Sichuan native, had been in Shanghai for years, working in Sichuan shops, handling native Sichuan products. Due to misfortune and repeated failures, Li had a novel idea last December, gathering funds with several fellow villagers to establish a small-scale opium den called "Shuyuan" in the kitchen lean-to downstairs at No. 3 Shou Kang Lane, Huolun Mill Street in the French Concession. As a result, many Sichuan natives familiar with Li and addicted to opium flocked to it like ducks.</p>
<p>Qian Product Youth: After Li opened Shuyuan, business was manageable. A few months ago, a Western-dressed young customer arrived, calling himself Wang Shunong, from Guizhou, around 30 years old. He would light a lamp and smoke. Although Wang was addicted to opium, his consumption was minimal, at most about 40 cents worth. With hundreds of customers visiting daily, the den did not inquire into his background. After his first visit, Wang returned to the den every few days or once every few weeks, at no fixed time.</p>
<p>Assassin's Bombardment: Around 7:00 PM yesterday, Wang came alone, took off his Western jacket, hung it on a hook, and lay down on the second bunk, north of the back door facing the street, loading and smoking. Around 8:45 PM, a young man in a white long gown suddenly burst in through the back door, his eyes scanning the room. Seeing Wang lying on the bunk, he suddenly produced a pistol and fired at Wang's face. The ruthless bullet entered Wang's right cheek and pierced his left forehead, leaving a hole.</p>
<p>Detective Investigation: Upon hearing the gunshot, the owner Li Haiyun and his associates and customers scattered and fled. Seeing his objective achieved, the killer seized the opportunity to escape without a trace. Realizing a crime had been committed, the owner immediately reported to the Daximingzhong Police Station. Upon hearing the news, the police chief ordered detectives Wang Licheng and Zhang Ziying to investigate. They found Wang unconscious and immediately sent him to Renji Hospital, but it was too late; he died instantly. Detectives Zhang and Wang questioned Li Haiyun and his associates in detail, all of whom claimed not to know the deceased. No one could clearly identify the killer's appearance.</p>
<p>Business Card Address: Detectives Zhang and Wang removed the deceased's Western jacket and found over ten cards in the left inner pocket, all bearing the name Wang Shunong and the printed address: No. 1456, Sanduo Lane, Changbin Road. There was also a card of Zhang Zhihan and two military train tickets from the Ministry of Military Affairs. Nothing else was found. After the search, the detectives took the den owner Li Haiyun and two associates to the Songshan Road Special Agency. They then went to the Xinzha Police Station to meet with the on-duty detectives and proceeded to Sanduo Lane for a detailed investigation. They found No. 1456, where four women were playing mahjong in the main room. When asked if a Mr. Wang lived there, one woman replied that the house was occupied by a Mr. Jiang alone and that no one named Wang lived there. The detectives explained their purpose, which annoyed the woman. At the same time, sounds of singing arose from upstairs, saying, "How could there be a Mr. Wang here?" followed by foreign language. Shortly, a stout Westerner around 40 years old and a fashionable woman came downstairs.</p>
<p>Wang Moves Out: Upon seeing the detectives, the Westerner asked the reason for their visit and requested to see their cards. At this moment, the fashionable woman suddenly seemed to realize something and exclaimed, "I understand now! A Mr. Wang did live here, but he moved out three years ago. His name was Wang Shunong, and he lived in the attic for only two months. He changed a woman every day to live with him, and we heard him spouting communist rhetoric, so we asked him to leave."</p>
<p>Woman's Testimony: After hearing this, the detectives asked the fashionable woman her name. She said her name was Jiang Meina and pointed to the stout Westerner, saying, "That's my husband," with a joyful expression. The reporter left, sweating profusely. The deceased had moved out of Sanduo Lane three years ago but still used the address, the reason for which outsiders could not know. The body has been transported to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for examination today.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Continued Trial of the Qu Ma Case <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Two Victims Identify the American Soldier as the Assailant</p>
<p>Qu Relates the Circumstances of His Injury</p>
<p>Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the military court of the U.S. Marine Corps held the second hearing of the Qu Ma case, in which an American soldier was accused of assault, at the barracks on Haifang Road. The hearing adjourned after more than two hours. The witnesses summoned were the victims, Ma Chengbu and Qu Shixiang. Although their wounds had healed, both Ma and Qu had scars about a foot long on their lower left jaws, Ma's wound being particularly deep. Ma and Qu both identified the American soldier as the assailant without error. First, Ma Chengbu related the details of his injury, stating that in the late evening of May 26, he saw an American soldier chasing a shopkeeper, Qu Haigou, at the intersection of Avenue Embankment and Seymour Road. He stepped forward to dissuade him. The American soldier punched him in the nose, causing him to bleed. The American soldier then took a rickshaw eastward. Because he was injured, he stopped the rickshaw, demanding that the American soldier go to the military officer or the police station to argue why he had beaten someone who was trying to mediate. At that time, a patrolling officer arrived and advised Ma to let it go, saying that he was a foreigner and to let it slide. The shopkeeper, Qu Shixiang, also came to advise Ma to return to the store. Ma refused because his nose had been injured and was bleeding, and he insisted on reason. At this time, another foreign soldier and a civilian foreigner got off a tram and pushed him aside, allowing the American soldier who had assaulted him to leave by rickshaw. Shortly after, the two newcomers also tried to leave by rickshaw, but Ma grabbed the rickshaw of the civilian foreigner and refused to let go, questioning why they were helping the American soldier who had assaulted him to escape. The civilian foreigner then took out a knife and stabbed wildly, hitting him four times, twice on the lower left jaw, once in the chest, and once on the left arm, causing heavy bleeding and fainting. Qu Shixiang testified that he initially thought the foreigner was just cursing, but he did not know he had a knife. He stepped forward to dissuade him and was also stabbed twice, once in the lower left jaw and once in the chest. The two assailants then drove east. Finally, Ma Chengbu regained consciousness and was helped by two people to a bar on Gordon Road, where he saw the assailant inside. Ma sat on the escalator and fainted again. The prosecutor asked how many people were present at the time. Ma and Qu answered the same, saying there were only about a dozen pedestrians. The court then adjourned. There are still ten witnesses to be summoned: two patrol officers, Nos. 811 and 2125, rickshaw driver Tan Fulin, tailor Wang Shuyou, tram driver Lu Shanxiang, four Western detectives, and U.S. Army Captain Tiersley. The hearing will continue today and will take several days to complete.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Tian Shulan Sets Off on a Tour of the Country <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Departed from the North Station at 12:00 Noon Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Tian Shulan, a professor at Minzhi Middle School in Shanghai, embarked on a six-year tour of the country. He departed from Shanghai North Station by bicycle at 12:00 noon yesterday. The details of yesterday's events are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival at the Station: After 10:00 AM yesterday, dozens of Minzhi teachers and students went to the plaza at North Station, holding flags to welcome him. Relatives and friends of Mr. Tian arrived one after another, numbering about thirty or forty. At 11:30 AM, Mr. Tian arrived by car. Photographers took pictures of Mr. Tian, front and back. Shortly after, firecrackers were lit. Mr. Tian then left the station by car, heading to Baoshan Road Station. An escort team of eight students on bicycles accompanied him, returning to Shanghai after Songjiang.</p>
<p>Source of Travel Expenses: As a man of modest means, Mr. Tian's source of funding for his tour of the country is a topic of interest. It is understood that, apart from some travel expenses provided by Minzhi, he adheres to the principle of "no fundraising, no subsidies." He sets off alone, relying solely on the sale of travel route maps and travel photos for his journey. These items will be purchased by schools and institutions in various places. He will also use the proceeds from his travelogue to supplement his expenses.</p>
<p>Collecting Materials: Before his departure, Mr. Tian prepared various forms, such as travel survey forms, city survey forms, and folk art collection forms, to facilitate data collection and compilation during his travels. He will organize and compile his findings, with the goal of informing the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Elementary School Student Escapes Kidnapping <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Claims to Have Escaped While the Bandits Were Asleep</p>
<p>Family Claims Losses Exceed 50,000</p>
<p>Wang Ruibao, son of Wang Zhengguo, a Ningbo native and former dye merchant residing at No. 1451 Zhonghua Road, Nanshi, was kidnapped on the 12th of last month while on his way to school in his private rickshaw. The incident occurred near the Siming Guildhall on Xinqiao Street in the French Concession. The kidnappers used a car rented from the Zhongshan Motor Company at No. 295 Zhapu Road. They then forced the driver, Wang Youfu, out of the car in a remote area of Xietu Road. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Two weeks have passed since the incident, with no news. Until yesterday morning, the hostage's family reported to the No. 2 Sub-District of the No. 2 District that Wang Ruibao had escaped the previous night around 9:00 PM while the bandits were asleep. According to the young hostage, he was taken to a two-story Shikumen house after being kidnapped. After two days, he was moved to a more secluded location, but he could not identify the names of either place. He said that he was treated well in the bandits' lair. Around 9:00 PM two nights ago, one of the bandits suddenly said to him, "Tonight you can go home. But if anyone asks you how you escaped, just say you escaped while we were asleep." Shortly after, they released him and hired a rickshaw for him. On the way, the hostage asked the rickshaw driver for the name of the area. The driver said it was near the Yiyuan Dog Racing Track. Director Zhang immediately submitted a report to the Director of Police. However, according to those close to the hostage's family, there had been numerous negotiations since Ruibao's kidnapping, resulting in losses exceeding 50,000.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Ms. Wang Guifen, Daughter of Martyr Qiu Jin and Female Aviator, Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Soon to Depart for France and Italy for Further Studies</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Guifen, daughter of revolutionary martyr Qiu Jin, is the first Chinese woman to pursue a career in aviation. After studying aeronautics at New York University in the United States for several years, she has returned to China, arriving in Shanghai recently aboard the Changxing Company's Empress of Russia. A reporter from the New Voice Society met her at her residence yesterday, where she discussed her aviation experiences in detail. Ms. Wang stated that she studied aircraft manufacturing and aeronautical knowledge at New York University for over two years. She is skilled in the manufacture of modern single-wing, biplane, naval, military, and transport aircraft. However, she was unable to study the manufacture of the latest American invention, silent camouflage (which releases colored smoke similar to clouds to conceal the aircraft in flight), as the Americans keep these military secrets to themselves. Many American women are engaged in aviation and are very adventurous. The government strongly promotes aviation. The US government has established meteorological stations specifically for aviation across the country, which report weather, wind, rain, and fog daily to ensure aviation safety. Ms. Wang has collected many books on weather measurement, aviation school organization, aircraft manufacturing, aerial radio, and aerial navigation methods, which she plans to translate for those in China who are interested in studying aviation. She plans to leave Shanghai soon for Europe to continue her aeronautical studies at the most famous aviation schools in Italy and France. Upon returning to China, she hopes to work with the government to promote the development of aviation and encourage Chinese women to emulate the courage and adventurousness of American women in pursuing aviation. It is also reported that Ms. Wang is skilled in boxing.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Summer Office Hours for the Two Courts <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>8:00 AM to 12:00 Noon</p>
<p>The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Special District Court have advanced their office hours, starting yesterday and lasting for two months until August 31. Office hours will be from 8:00 AM to 12:00 Noon daily. In the afternoon, only the traffic, health, and other courts of the Special District Court on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, and the appellate collegial court for summary cases on Mondays and Tuesdays, will hold regular hearings. Otherwise, unless there are particularly urgent cases, there will be complete rest. Since public and private criminal suits are concentrated in the morning, the Special District Court's existing criminal court is deeply concerned about being insufficient. It has temporarily borrowed the former No. 3 Court from the High Court for use when needed. The two courts have also established a rotating duty system for judges and prosecutors during the summer vacation to ensure public service.</p>

<p>The Emergency Epidemic Hospital at No. 30 North Xizang Road was jointly founded by the late merchant Huang Chujiu and other philanthropists. It has a history of seven years, treating tens of thousands of impoverished and acutely ill patients annually. Since Mr. Huang's death, the directors have strived to maintain and develop it. Mr. Du Yuesheng has been specially appointed as the president of the hospital, a position he has accepted. Mr. Du has a deep enthusiasm for charity and has many new plans for the hospital, promising a prosperous future. Yesterday marked the official opening of the hospital. Over thirty directors attended, including Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Ye Shantao, Pang Jingzhou, Zhou Bangjun, Wang Boqi, Huang Xianzhong, Gao Peiliang, and Guo Xiufu. The directors expressed sincere opinions on the hospital's operations and pledged to raise donations to expand it and benefit society.</p>

<p>Started the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Buddhist scholar Wang Yiting and others initiated the National Prayer for Peace and Universal Salvation Assembly. Li Fuhou and Yao Fuqing, Dharma protectors of Jing'an Temple, and Abbot Zhifa advocated building a Water and Land Daochang. In addition, Jiang Boqi, Wang Dunren, Jiang Huibang, and others from the Buddhist Light Society used Jing'an Temple as the venue. The convergence of these three factors resulted in this grand and auspicious Daochang. Many of those recommending ancestors for salvation donated generously for the Water and Land expenses, demonstrating their sincerity. The Daochang started the day before yesterday. Abbot Jiechang of Jiangxi Baohua Mountain, Abbot Huikai of Fazang Temple, and Lecturer Liao Chang of the Buddhist Pure Land Society were invited to preside over the ceremonies, all renowned and virtuous monks. On the evening of the 5th, a grand fast was held for the heavens. All believers who support the society's prayer assembly were invited to attend. Such a grand event has not been seen at Jing'an Temple in decades.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department Offers Free Vaccinations for Workers <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Factories Please Note</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department has formed two teams that rotate through various districts of the Public Concession to provide free cholera vaccinations. In June, they vaccinated a total of 31,000 people, mostly workers. However, many schools also vaccinated students before the holidays. Fewer women were vaccinated, with a ratio of about 1:3 compared to men, indicating that female workers in larger factories are not paying enough attention to prevention. To facilitate vaccinations for workers, the Health Department will send personnel with the necessary supplies to factories upon notification. According to reports, the vaccine's reaction in workers does not disrupt their work or reduce their efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Brother Sues Brother Over Unclear Inheritance Accounts <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Seeking to Reconcile Four Types of Accounts</p>
<p>Defendant Hires Lawyer to Defend</p>
<p>Guo Bichen, owner of the Guo Yuanmao Earth Shop and a Cantonese native, passed away in the 11th year of the Republic of China, leaving a substantial inheritance. After reserving a portion for ancestral rites, the remainder was divided among his sons, Qiaoqing, Songqing, Xuanqian, Jianqian, and Fenxi. Xuanqian was entrusted with managing the ancestral property. Now, after ten years without a report, Songqing is dissatisfied and has hired lawyers Jiang Yinian and Wu Guoan to sue Xuanqian, requesting that the ancestral property accounts be submitted for reconciliation. There are four types of accounts: (1) 8,000 taels of shares in the Qianyuandejizhuang and 6,000 taels of shares in the Shenda Flour Mill. These two amounts were divided into four shares, and the plaintiff should receive 3,500 taels. (2) the Sendadong Pawnshop, Qianmaodong Pawnshop, and ChaoYang's Ziadong Pawnshop were all established solely by Bichen. The account books from previous years should be submitted for liquidation. (3) When Guangyu Money Exchange closed, it owed over 100,000. Xuanqian handled the collection of debts. The actual amount collected was never reported and should be reconciled. (4) Guangyu still has over 180,000 in cash. Over 8,000 taels were taken out as public property. This amount should also be divided into four shares, and the plaintiff should receive over 2,000 taels. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenyong of the Special District Court presided over the hearing. After the plaintiff's lawyer stated each count of the lawsuit, the defendant defended each count. He claimed that the Ziadong Pawnshop was jointly owned with his cousin Liu Xihong. The important account books were destroyed by communist bandits years ago, and Liu concealed the proceeds, so there are no results. He stated that all other businesses had traceable accounts and hired lawyer Yan Yinwu to defend him. Judge Xu adjourned the hearing to a later date for further review.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Master Brother Attempts to Strangle Junior Brother <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Claiming a Father's Murder</p>
<p>Qian Minglong, a tailor's apprentice at No. 1167 Zhonghua Road, Xiaoximen, is only a little over ten years old. His master brother, Zhang Hongfeng, who had already stopped working there, constantly suspected that Qian had slandered him, harboring a deep-seated grudge. The other day, Zhang came to the shop to hang around. Since it was late, he didn't leave and slept in the same bed with Qian. Unexpectedly, after Qian fell asleep, Zhang used a trouser belt to loop around Qian's neck. Both pulled on it, attempting to strangle Qian to death. Fortunately, Qian woke up and grabbed the belt with his hands, shouting for help. People in the shop heard the noise and all got up to investigate. They restrained Zhang. Qian's neck had already been scratched. Because the matter involved murder, the police were called to arrest Zhang and detain him in the Second District, Second Precinct. Yesterday, he was sent to the District Court. Prosecutor Yang interrogated him. Zhang confessed that Qian's father had plotted to kill his father, so he was avenging his father, which was the truth. However, Qian said that his father had no feud with Zhang's father. The official, based on Zhang's admission of murder, ordered him to be detained pending punishment.</p>

<p>His Life is in Grave Danger</p>
<p>Jiang Zaitang, a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 8 Run'an Lane, Ximen Road, in the French Concession, is twenty-five years old. Last night, he went to Pin Chengliang in Lane 5, nearby, to enjoy the cool air. Suddenly, five or six enemies came, pulled out sharp axes, and without asking any questions, struck Jiang's right leg with one axe, breaking his tibia. Another axe struck his right waist, penetrating about six inches deep, with blood gushing like a spring. He fainted on the spot. The assailants, seeing that their purpose had been achieved, all left swaggeringly. When Jiang's family heard the alarm and arrived, Zaitang was barely breathing and his life was hanging by a thread. They immediately hired a car and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that his life is in great danger.</p>

<p>Firmly Requesting a Reduction in the Business Tax Rate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Department Store Trade Association, feeling overwhelmed by the heavy business tax rate, had previously sent representatives to the Tax Law Research Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to explain their inability to bear the burden. Mr. Fang Jiaobo and Zheng Dengqing of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce promised to find a way to provide relief. The association, considering the urgency and the public anxiety, specially sent representatives Zheng Hairuo, Cheng Guichu, and Su Boyin by express train to Beijing last night to petition the Ministry of Finance. Based on the Ministry's outline and the Ministry's interpretation of the original Wuhan business tax plan, they firmly requested the correction of the Shanghai Department Store business tax rate draft, striving to achieve their goal.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Opposing the Feetham Report <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Joint Declaration by Over Seventy Labor Unions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Publishing Industry Union, Postal Workers' Union, First District Water and Electricity Industry Union, First District Cotton Textile Industry Union, First District Shipbuilding Industry Union, First District Papermaking Industry Union, First District Knitting Industry Union, First District Garment Industry Union, First District Carpentry Industry Union, First District Cleaning Industry Union, Municipal Sauce Industry Union, Municipal Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Municipal Newspaper Distribution Industry Union, Municipal Pharmaceutical Trade Union, Municipal Western Cuisine Industry Union, Municipal Hat Making Industry Union, Municipal Customs Brokerage Industry Union, Municipal Tea and Pastry Industry Union, Municipal Match Industry Union, Municipal Starch Noodle Industry Union, Municipal Letterpress Printing Industry Union, Municipal Shipyard Woodworkers Union, Municipal Water and Electricity Company Union, and over seventy other labor unions issued a declaration opposing the Feetham Report. At this time when the National Government formally announced the recovery of the concessions, "the Shanghai Municipal Council and the continuously published so-called Feetham Report" praised the goodness of the concession system and repeatedly stated that, given the current situation, the recovery of the concessions was almost impossible. These kinds of fallacies are infuriating to read. The position of the concessions has no legal basis, and the governing power of the concessions was entirely seized. Recovering this seized governing power has long been a unanimous goal of the entire country. Now, fortunately, the National Government is fully negotiating and is gradually seeing progress. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council, at this time of its demise, did not hesitate to spend the heavy money paid by the citizens to hire a judge, Feetham, from South Asia who was accustomed to ruling colonies, to issue this</p>
<p>fallacy, using it as a defense. It only shows that their efforts are becoming increasingly futile. The Feetham Report clearly states in the opening remarks: "To advise the Municipal Council, to assist the Council in planning construction projects, and to provide reasonable and adequate protection for the commercial interests of foreigners engaged in business in Shanghai" (English version, Volume 1, page 5). Although it was later stated that the words "foreigners" were deleted, Sima Zhao's intentions are known to everyone. Our associations dare to formally tell all friendly foreign merchants that the development of international commerce is entirely based on equality and friendship of mutual understanding. If, on the one hand, you firmly hold onto the illegal rights that have been seized, and on the other hand, you want to develop the commercial interests of foreigners, this is truly like wanting to go south by driving the chariot north, which is simply impossible. If friendly foreign merchants do not want to harm the goodwill of the nationals of the country where they are located and seek the development of their commerce, they should urge their own government to immediately return the seized governing power of the concessions to China. Otherwise, being deceived by a few unscrupulous merchants and wanting to maintain this concession system, which is approaching its end, and struggling against the wishes of the people of our entire country, the dire consequences can be imagined. What to choose, we hope that the wise and intelligent friendly foreign merchants will decide. Our associations also want to say that the content of the Feetham Report is almost entirely filled with statements that violate the facts and disregard international etiquette. Since he brazenly dares to issue such fallacies, then our nationals should also demand that the government immediately expel him from the country. At the same time, we demand that the Shanghai Municipal Council immediately withdraw this Feetham Report that disregards international etiquette. If there are any unfilial nationals who dare to associate with this kind of arrogant foreigner, or even be used by them, our nationals will all regard them as national traitors and abandon them together. This is our solemn declaration.</p>

<p>Regarding the previous dispute between the China General Edison Company and the workers of the Arsenal and Jiangnan Shipyard over bus passes, it was resolved through mediation by both parties. General Manager Lu of the company sent Lu Zhonglin, the head of the Lighting Department, to negotiate with Director Guo of the Arsenal and Director Ma of the Shipyard, and a solution was reached. The original old bus passes will be exchanged for new ones, and the number of passes will be slightly increased by the Arsenal and Shipyard. The company's bus pass subsidy fee will be implemented starting from July 1st. The Arsenal originally had 2,300 bus passes with a monthly subsidy of 200 yuan, and the Longhua Arsenal Branch had 1,000 bus passes with a subsidy of 30 yuan. Now, the Arsenal has requested the company to increase the number of bus passes by 570, for a total of 3,870. The subsidy fee will be increased by 20% based on the previous price. The Jiangnan Shipyard originally had 1,500 bus passes with a monthly subsidy of 200 yuan, and now they are adding 780 passes, which will also be increased by 20%. The added bus passes will be priced accordingly. The new bus passes have been affixed with photos and divided into two or three grades. Yesterday, the company distributed them, and they were allowed to be exchanged for new passes starting yesterday. Director Guo of the Arsenal issued a notice stating: "Notice regarding the matter of bus rides for workers of this Arsenal. The workers of this Arsenal are now riding the China General Edison Company's trams. The company has changed to new passes, which have been distributed and claimed by the Arsenal's Labor Union. All old passes will be invalidated from July 1st. From now on, if anyone still carries an old pass to ride the bus, the company should check and have the person return it for cancellation. This notice is hereby issued for your information."</p>

<p>All the workers in the tin-packaging section of the old British American Tobacco factory in Pudong went on strike because they opposed the factory's failure to follow the original practice of automatically adding seven long-term workers.

<p>Dear Editor, This is to inform you that according to Mr. Xiang Caibao's statement, the "Shen Bao" reported on the Fukuyou Road blood case that two people escaped, implicating Caibao. The facts reported are not accurate. Caibao has been running a shop in the Chenghuang Temple area for many years and is a law-abiding businessman. He does not know a person named Xiao Wang. Where did the previous information come from? At the time of the incident, Caibao was in the shop doing business. How could he have been talking at the Huayang Lou? After the incident, Caibao was not involved. Why would he need to escape? The Second Precinct of the First District and the District Court have not investigated him. The newspaper's report is obviously inaccurate and concerns his reputation. Therefore, he entrusted us to write this letter to request a correction. We would appreciate your public cooperation. Sincerely, Lawyer Chao Kun, July 1st.</p>

<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>The Train That Obeys Commands</p>
<p>A train is a mechanical, soulless thing. How can it understand people's commands? However, this actually happened. In London, England, a newly invented electric train model was displayed. Experts tested it, and it was found that by simply shouting "Stop," the engine would immediately stop. By shouting "Go," the engine would start and move forward. It is said that the inner workings rely on a transmitter and the fluctuation of sound waves to determine movement and stopping. Its structure is very complex.</p>
<p>The Nine-Foot, Nine-Inch Long Fish</p>
<p>A very large tuna was recently caught in the ocean fourteen miles off the coast of Scarborough in northern England. It measured nine feet and nine inches long and weighed six hundred pounds. In the fish world, it can be considered a giant. According to experienced fishermen, such a fish may be caught in the North Sea because the water in the North Sea was warmer three years ago, and tuna had appeared.</p>
<p>A 10,000-Year Lease</p>
<p>No matter which country in the world, the term for leasing real estate is at most a few decades. Unexpectedly, the town of Lahti in Finland leased a piece of land to an oil company as a fueling station and unexpectedly signed a 10,000-year lease. This can be considered a new record in leases.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Glimpses of the Capital <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>It has been two years since I left the capital. Recently, after finishing my studies, I traveled with a friend for sightseeing again. What I saw and heard was quite noteworthy. Therefore, I will describe it.</p>
<p>The area beside Zhongshan Road was once extremely desolate, but now it has become a prosperous marketplace and political center. Great and magnificent buildings are everywhere. The Saga Bay area is where various ministries are concentrated. Those that have been completed include the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of the Navy, and the Ministry of Military Affairs. Those under construction include the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Finance. The scale is astonishing. The official residence of the Ministry of Railways is palace-style and extremely beautiful. The Ministry of Communications, which is under construction, is opposite the Ministry of Railways in a similar style, but its grandeur seems to surpass it.</p>
<p>The Bund in Shanghai is a bank street, and Simalu is a bookstore street. The bank street in Nanjing is in the Daxing Palace area. Various banks have marked the construction foundations, but construction has not yet started. The bookstore street is in Huapai Lou, with more than a dozen bookstores. The newly built roads in Nanjing are wider than those in Shanghai and sometimes have narrower stone roads built next to the asphalt roads, specifically for horse carriages. The atmosphere is majestic, and the power of construction is great.</p>
<p>Public buses used to be operated by several companies, but now they are monopolized by Xinghua. Because there were many disputes with female ticket sellers, they are no longer used. It is said that Xinghua Company is run by a certain important person. Therefore, all soldiers must buy tickets. It is said that buying tickets is quite funny. Regardless of the distance, soldiers only pay three copper coins, probably to save face.</p>
<p>Sound movies are very popular in Beijing. The National Theater is particularly outstanding. It mostly shows famous films from Shanghai, and the seats are full. However, in terms of construction, it is still far behind Shanghai. The sound is also unclear. The singing of female singers in the Confucius Temple area has been sluggish recently, probably due to the trends of the times and natural elimination.</p>
<p>Aircraft training takes place every day, and its various performances are particularly astonishing. Sometimes they tumble left and right, and sometimes they speed up and down. It is heart-stirring and cannot be watched to the end. Incidents that lead to accidents are also heard every day. Lately, military tensions have increased, and aircraft have become more important. German and American instructors are working hard to train them. It is said that a large team will be dispatched soon.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Old Youngsters in the Art World <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>"Old Youngster" is a different name for amaranth, a wonderful embellishment for autumn fences. However, what I call "Old Youngsters" refers to Zhao Banbo, Wu Ziding, two old men, and Ma Wanli, a young man. The changes of nature, the divine hand, and the lonely art world are all brightened and colored. This is a good story. I once saw the exhibition of Old Youngsters. It still lingers in my mind. Wanli is a master of flowers. His works are all outstanding and refreshing, with a clear fragrance. Mr. Zeng Nongran calls him "creating spring everywhere," which is not empty praise. A daffodil with only a few strokes is full of elegance. Xuanxuan's charm is relaxed and natural. He can be regarded as a masterpiece. Banbo's works are characterized by sparseness and distance. He resembles Qing Teng and Xue Ge. This is why Banbo took the characters Teng and Xue as the name of his apartment building. Ziding Wu Ruifen is the most skilled in figures and ladies. He has deeply understood the essence of Gai Qixiang. "Girls Returning to Wash Clothes in the Bamboo Noise" shows his skill in painting bamboo. Su Changgong said, "When painting bamboo, one must first have a bamboo in one's mind." Ziding must have bamboo in his heart. "Begging for Skills" and "Seeking Plum Blossoms" are also meticulously crafted. It is not easy to find them in Shanghai. Last winter, Ziding went to Shexian, Anhui, to serve as the county secretary. With his nature of a free-spirited person, he could not bear the trouble of official documents and politics. He came to Shanghai a few days ago, bringing with him several pines from Huangshan. The cost of transportation was several hundred strings, but he did not hesitate. Ziding is good at chanting and has many poems commemorating his travels. He traveled along the Fuchun River by boat and passed Yanling Lai, which happened to be in a dream at night. Therefore, he wrote the line "Stealing past the Fishing Terrace in the deep night." Ziding lives in Wu Zhong Luqiu Fangxiang. He indulges in poetry and wine and enjoys painting. With his youthful face and rosy complexion, he is truly a celestial being.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Small Recipes <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yixiao</p>
<p>Vegetable Soup: Take dried bamboo shoots, soak them until soft, and tear them into small pieces. Take one slice each of center-cut duck meat, ham, and *qiao* bamboo shoots. Shape them like a bundle of firewood. Stew them in chicken soup until tender. This is called vegetable soup.</p>
<p>Crab Eggs: Cut off the claws and legs of fresh crabs. Pour egg whites on top and stir-fry two or three times, then stop.</p>
<p>Steamed Carp: Use the head of a carp. Add chicken soup and slices of ham. Place it on top of the rice pot to steam. The flavor is particularly delicious.</p>
<p>Frozen Pigeon: Chop the pigeon into small pieces. Braise it in dark soy sauce and medicinal oil. After it is removed from the pot, place it in the refrigerator so that it solidifies into a jelly. Sprinkle a little licorice and fennel powder on the outside.</p>
<p>Shrimp Brain: When peeling shrimp, take the brains. Briefly soak them in boiling water. Mix them with soy sauce, sesame oil, and agar-agar. The flavor is incredibly fresh and tender.</p>
<h3 id="e156">A Study of Kissing and Eyebrow Painting <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Linchang</p>
<p>"Kissing" is a passionate expression of love. A couple in love touches lips, sweetly intoxicated. But fashionable people today desperately imitate Western customs, thinking that "kissing" also comes from the West. Little do they know that this kind of romantic affair already existed in China long ago. However, Western customs are public, while Chinese ones are secret. Like the ancient poems about courtesans, "A little bit of red lips tasted by ten thousand guests" is what we now call "kissing." Also, Guo Sheren's "Fei concubine's lips are as sweet as candy," and the Romance of the West Chamber's "mouth seeking tongue" depict "kissing" with what resemblance. "Kissing" is a heady thing. "A lover's kiss is worth more than ten *yi* of gold." However, according to a certain hygienist, "Kissing is a medium for infectious diseases. Each kiss results in the exchange of millions of microorganisms between lips." Affectionate compatriots of both sexes should pay attention.</p>
<p>The poem about painting eyebrows says, "This child is clear and bright." "Clear" refers to the eyes, and "bright" refers to the eyebrows. Also, "moth eyebrows" are said to be the most beautiful eyebrows of a beautiful woman. In ancient times, eyebrows were naturally beautiful, so grooming was done, not painting. Song Yu's "Summoning the Soul" says, "Moth eyebrows, beautiful eyes, and beautiful instructions." This refers to painting. Later, Wen Jun went far away with Jiang Xian's beauty, Jing Zhao's charming eyebrows, and Ying Jie's eyebrow habits, all of which were painters. Emperor Ming of Tang had a "Ten Eyebrow Diagram," such as horizontal clouds and crescent moons. Eyebrow painting in the Five Dynasties palace was classified into ten types: (1) Kaiyuan's imperial love, (2) Little Mountain, (3) Five Peaks, (4) Three Peaks, (5) Drooping Pearl, (6) Moon Ridge, (7) Powder Tip, (8) Containing Smoke, (9) Brushing Clouds, (10) Inverted Halo. It is unknown why no one pays attention to it in modern times.</p>
<h3 id="e157">A Friend's Child <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Chengxin</p>
<p>A friend of mine has a child who is five years old. He is as thin and weak as an old man. He has been taking tonics all year round, but they are not effective. Recently, he suffered from typhoid fever, followed by aphonia. The doctor looked worried. His mother loves him very much and weeps all day long, not knowing what to do. Considering that his family is wealthy, if he had been properly cared for, he should have been stronger than ordinary children. However, love was not given in the right way, and the principles of child physiology were neglected. As a result, his illness became increasingly obvious. Only then did they seek miraculous medicine, but it was too late. Now, I will briefly describe one or two of the inappropriate aspects of his upbringing and care to inform those who raise children, so that they know what to pay attention to and do not repeat his mistakes. My friend, if he hears of this, will hopefully not take offense.</p>
<p>When the child was first born, a wet nurse fed him milk. Sometimes, he would occasionally spit up his milk, which was mistakenly taken as overeating. He was forbidden to be fed again. The child cried from hunger, but no one cared. Until he was four years old, he was still not weaned. He was not fed rice either. All year round, he was confined to a high pavilion, and his windows were tightly closed. Whenever the weather was slightly cold, he was dressed in double the amount of clothing. He became as bloated as a roly-poly toy. As a result, the child's body became weaker and weaker. The parents still did not know to change their ways, as if they were afraid that he would not get sick. Although their love for their child was deep, their intentions were not blameworthy. However, because of improper upbringing and care, they ultimately harmed his body, which is truly regrettable. Wags say that their neglect of science is no different from intentionally using science to put a child in danger. I wonder what excuses these parents will use to justify themselves?</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The university buildings are neat and magnificent. I told Mr. Wenke Tolun that Indians do not pay attention to politics but focus on religion and philosophy. If Gandhi's doctrines spread to villages everywhere in the future, your India will once again practice anarchism. Today, the people have never paid attention to politics. There is no need to explain politics. Just attach them to school districts. Set up more work-study villages. It will be enough for leaders like Gandhi to govern. I think if India truly has a day of freedom, this will also be a dream.</p>
<p>Indian students are very polite and follow the rules in an orderly manner. They have no arrogance. They are not like Chinese students who agitate for trends. There is still no trend of students being the masters and teachers being the guests. They still maintain good habits. I visited their dining hall. It is not like our country where they eat at tables and chairs. Instead, they sit on the ground, which is either covered with wooden boards or carpets. Each person uses a copper plate. The plate contains two dishes and rice. They eat with their hands. Generally, they eat rice at noon and wheat cakes in the evening. The cakes are not much different from those in China. Only the northern-made single cakes are smaller in India and sometimes have oil added.</p>
<p>On the 25th, students guided me through the garden. It is said that this city has many gardens, some public and some private. I went to the garden and saw many flowers. The flower beds are in various shapes and are very beautiful. Indians love flowers and pick them to offer to Buddha. The ancient tradition of burning incense and scattering flowers still exists today. The flowers do not wither in all seasons, which is a characteristic of India. But I feel that not many tropical flowers are fragrant. On this day, I discussed with the professors and asked me to make a declaration for the Asian Education Association, briefly stating the prosperity of Asian culture since ancient times. All races and religions originate from Asia. No saints teach killing. Since the beginning of modern education, we should use humanism to fairly govern society and strive for the great unity of the world. This responsibility requires the awakening and connection of Asian people. Moreover, after the war, Europeans longed for the westward spread of Eastern culture. Therefore, we should strive to organize and promote world peace. As for pan-Asian connection, it is of course a big problem. However, as far as I know and from past experience, the longing for connection is greatest among Indians. In China, it is hardly felt. This is because Chinese people do not pay attention to this, and very few people do. Or it may be because their vision is short-sighted. As for those who can connect with each other, Indians can connect with Buddhist countries such as China and Japan. Of course, there is no problem. However, it is very difficult to connect with Muslim countries. If Chinese people do it, it is relatively easier. Muslims have very good feelings towards Chinese people, which is false for Indians. It is not difficult to send people to Turkey to connect.</p>

<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>After Yue Ru went downstairs, Zi Liang closed the door of the attic. As he sat down again, he couldn't help but think of the past. Before he was married, he often thought, "In the future, when I have a wife, I will go home every night. I will read under the lamp, and my wife will sit next to me and keep me company. She will do some needlework and keep me company until the night is quiet. Wouldn't that be interesting?" Who knew that after marriage, the ideal and reality were so far apart. Now, if Zi Liang wants to study hard, he absolutely cannot let her stay by his side. Otherwise, she will only make noise, how can he do anything? Zi Liang also thought, "If my finances were more relaxed, I would definitely find a temple to rent a room in, so that I could study hard and avoid this beautiful demon from constantly缠不淸楚. If this continues, I might as well live at school starting in the second half of the year."</p>
<p>The door of the attic creaked open, and Yue Ru stood smiling at the door, holding a large bowl in her hand:</p>
<p>"Stop studying! Snacks are here!"</p>
<p>She brought it to Zi Liang's table. When Zi Liang looked, there were seven or eight different things in this large bowl: a sesame cake, a steamed bun, a glutinous rice ball, a piece of square cake, a fried dough stick, a scallion pancake, a small bread, like a ten-scene fruit platter put together; but each item was only one piece.</p>
<p>"What is this? It's not some kind of sample, everything is just one piece."</p>
<p>"Difficult questions, only you can ask! When I ask you what snack you want, you say anything. How can I guess what's in your stomach? I can only buy a few more items, and there will always be something you like!"</p>
<p>Zi Liang didn't listen to her reasoning. He was hungry enough, so he had to take it and eat. But it was already late, so he didn't dare to eat too much, leaving a small half in the bowl:</p>
<p>"Take it away!"</p>
<p>"After filling your stomach, you want to drive away the person who provided the food. You have no conscience!"</p>
<p>The madam took the big bowl away; but she didn't go downstairs, she went to the front room. After a while, only the sound of constant footsteps could be heard from the floorboards. She was 拉拉拉拉 singing, apparently practicing dancing there. Once, a friend came to visit Pan Zi Liang and sat downstairs. At that time, it just so happened that the madam was also practicing dancing upstairs. The friend heard the sound on the floorboards and looked up. Unexpectedly, the dust from the floorboards fell down and landed right in the friend's eyes, making it impossible to open them and impossible to remove them. Later, they called a barber to help remove it.</p>
<p>After the tenth line of yesterday's article, the phrase "is really a new record exceeding Pan's ancestral generations" was omitted.</p>

<h3 id="e160">The Mid-term Interest Rates in Financial Closure are Quiet <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, all the major Chinese and foreign banks were closed for the half-year accounting, so the market situation showed a very calm attitude. Even the gatherings of the money market were particularly brief, gathering and dispersing quickly. The time was less than half of the usual time, resulting in not much competition in interest rate prices. The interest rate for both the morning and afternoon markets was the same, at 7 *qian*, 2 *fen*, 6 *li*, and 2.5 *hao*. This was mostly similar to the price at the end of last month. The silver interest rate was 8 *fen* in the morning market and 7 *fen* in the afternoon market, which was also very average. The amount of remittance bills made was 455,000 in the morning market and only 300,500 in the afternoon market. There were no transactions in the banknote market in either the morning or afternoon. However, the out-of-market banknotes were 135,000 *jiao* in the morning market and 40,000 *jiao* in the afternoon market. The money shops received and delivered 5,780,000 in foreign public bills and more than 48,000,000 in silver public bills. The transactions of small money shops were more than 300,000. The remittances from various places were more than 500,000. The market situation for auxiliary coins was as follows: Jiangnan small dollars were 6 *qian*, 4 *fen*, and 8.5 *li* in the morning market, and the same price in the afternoon market. The amount of transactions made was 3,000 *jiao* in the morning market and no market in the afternoon. Guangdong small dollars were 6 *qian*, 4 *fen*, and 3.25 *li* in the morning market and 6 *qian*, 4 *fen*, and 3.5 *li* in the afternoon market. The amount of transactions made was 85,000 *jiao* in the morning market and 50,000 *jiao* in the afternoon market. Copper coins were changed to 500 *wen* each, totaling 377,500 *wen*.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday was the end of June, which is the big period for the half-year accounting.</p>
<p>The receiving and delivering procedures for the silver and money industry were more complicated than usual. Therefore, most banks sorted things out all night the night before. Many were still not finished by 6 or 7 o'clock yesterday morning, which shows one aspect of the complexity of the procedures. According to the current survey, the amount of receipts and deliveries for bills and various routine remittances, taxes, etc. reached more than 100 million. The amount of special remittances and settlements was also tens of millions. The amount of silver public bills received and delivered by the money shops was as high as 81,941,500 *liang*, which is a new record. According to previous years, a small number of merchants still adhered to the abandoned calendar for the half-year end, so the receiving, delivering and sorting times were different. This year, the dates have been unified, so the procedures on that day were particularly busy.</p>
<h3 id="e162">British Silver Continues to Shrink by 0.25 <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, July 1st, coincided with the half-year accounting period for banks. As usual, all Chinese and foreign banks did not conduct business. All financial and foreign exchange markets had no reports. However, according to the London telegram, the price of large bars of silver saw a continued shrinkage. The near and far terms both shrank by 0.25, both at 13.5 pence. China and India both sold off a little, so the market was flat. After the market closed, the market situation was flat but slightly firm. The United States had no tendency to sell. Also, according to the New York telegram, the price of American silver did not increase or decrease. The spot price was still 29.125 cents. There was no fluctuation in private telegrams either, so the market situation was stable. The US-Japan price decreased by one *fen*, to 49.40 yuan. The British-American price increased by 0.03125, to $4.863211. The American-British price increased by 0.0625, which was the same as $4.863211. The British-Japanese price was still 2 shillings and 0.375 pence. The British-Shanghai shilling increased by an *anna*, to 44 rupees and 11 *annas*. The far term also decreased by 2 *annas*, to 44 rupees and 7 *annas*. The market was uncertain.</p>

<p>The yarn market was slightly stronger. Because the price of silver shrank again, people's confidence improved slightly. However, the conditions of overseas cotton yarn were consistently declining. It was not possible to ask about the details of spot yarn transactions because the Yarn and Cloth Exchange had an arts and performance gathering at the Great Eastern in the afternoon for its tenth anniversary. Most people were not in the market, so there were no gatherings, making it difficult to investigate the market situation. It was only heard that the price of 150 bales of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 185 *liang*. The price of 100 bales of Li Ma was 185 *liang*. Both were conducted by the same industry for July and August terms. There were no other details. It will be recorded in detail tomorrow.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was soft due to the lack of major buyers, a weak Wall Street, and reactive selling. Futures fell 12 to 18 pounds, and spot prices fell 10 pounds. British cotton futures fell 10 to 11 points, and spot prices fell 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 10 points. Indian cotton was weak due to good weather and speculators selling off July terms. Pingguoer fell 4 rupees, Aomula fell 3 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell 6 rupees. The original telegram recorded on the left (telegram from the 30th):</p>

<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, seventeen or eighteen ships from the lower reaches of the river arrived at Guolu. The shops on this street were quite happy. There were few top-quality Changxi glutinous rice and Houjing. There were few transactions in the market, so the surface of the top price was flat. The price of Gao Tong in Zhongguan Market rose by 1 or 2 *jiao*. There was limited demand for Pu rice. The Ningbang's intention to buy was active, and prices rose by nearly a *chi*. Transactions of foreign tip rice were the smoothest, and the situation called for a price increase of 1.5 *chi*. The arrival and sale of Duba tip rice was evenly matched, and the price did not rise or fall. The sale of glutinous rice was slow at first but then smooth. The market was slightly tight. Yin Hua's dim sum shops were more active because the prices were cheap. All parties added more, and the price rose by 0.5 *chi*.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, a small amount of Changxi Yanzhi, etc., arrived in Shanghai. The market sales were flat. The trend of Changsu, Tongli, Bei㘮, and other glutinous rice was greatly increasing. The market price of top-quality goods and Zhongguan goods increased by 2 *chi*. However, the previous goods were mediocre. Early and late rice from Nangang was said to be still moving because the goods were scarce, so the price was raised by a *jiao*. Later, when it arrived in Pu, the situation became slightly slow. However, the market was still firm. Luyang tip rice was slightly selected at a high price, and there was no problem with the previous goods. The market was weak. Bian Yin Yuan only took high-quality goods, but the old hot</p>
<p>goods were cheap and had few transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Flour Market Initially Weak, Then Stable <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month was roughly stable due to the slight increase or decrease of the quoted price of foreign wheat by about 1 or 2 *jiao*. However, after the initial trading, some mainland merchants had absorbed some, and the market atmosphere was quite good. Then, due to some selling off by the manufacturers, it softened again. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the manufacturers had stopped selling off. Outside buyers were also not enthusiastic. Transactions were rare. The market trend was fluctuating. However, because the prospects for the gold market were still difficult to grasp, outside sentiments were inevitably slightly weakened. As a result, the closing price for July and August was 0.25 *li* lower than the previous month. The prices for September and October did not move. The price for November was 0.25 *li* lower. December initially opened at 2 *liang* and 7.5 *fen*, then decreased to 6 *fen*, and the closing price was 2 *liang*, 6 *fen*, and 7.5 *li*.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Wheat Futures Initially Fell, Then Rebounded After Covering Short Positions <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, the market for each month saw a period of decline. The current month was due to the smooth arrival of goods, and the manufacturers' positions were still bearish. Therefore, the clients' chips were all套入 standard, resulting in a very weak market atmosphere. The lowest price had been 3 *liang*, 6 *qian*, and 6 *fen*. The prices of the far-term months also showed a weak trend. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere strengthened again due to the covering of short positions and the interest of mainland traders. The rise and fall of the subsequent steps depends half on whether the manufacturers' positions are good and half on the gold market. As a result, the closing price of the current month rebounded by 2 *fen* compared to the previous month. The price for August rose by 3 *fen*. The prices for September and October rose by 4 *fen*. The price for November rose by 3 *fen*. The price for December initially opened at 4 *liang* and 3 *fen* in the morning, then decreased by 1 *fen*. There was no opening in the afternoon. The current wheat market atmosphere is still flat and weak. The manufacturers' positions are slightly better, but they are still raising the次, such as medium次 already as low as 2 *qian*. Those with a lot of mud were only packed and did not move. The city opened with more than 6,000 bags of wheat from Danyang, Yangzhou, Chuzhou, Hezhou, Huojiaqiao, Shuangfeng, Penglai, and Anting, of which more than 3,000 bags were handled by Fuxin Huafeng.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the first day of the half-year accounting holiday for various foreign firms in this port. All banks were closed, and there were no foreign exchange transactions. The foreign firm silk transactions will be suspended for both yesterday and today.</p>
<h3 id="e169">The Amount of Spring Dried Cocoons Transported to Shanghai from the Suzhou Area Has Been Greatly Reduced <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Only Two-Tenths of Previous Years: The Amount of Cocoons Transported to Shanghai is About 70,000 *dan*</p>
<p>This year's spring silkworms in the Suzhou area have suffered greatly from the weather. The cocoon production is unusually poor, totaling only three-tenths of the normal year. Moreover, there are few high-quality cocoons and many inferior ones. Although a small number of silk cocoon merchants went to various regions to set up shops to collect cocoons, the cocoon prices were unusually high, and inferior goods were rejected. Therefore, the amount collected was very small. The amount of dried cocoons transported to Shanghai has been greatly reduced, and transportation is about to come to an end. Except for the farmers who spin their own土丝, and the silk merchants in Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Suzhou who retain raw materials for their own use, the amount of cocoons transported to Shanghai from various regions totals about 70,000 *dan*.</p>
<h3 id="e170">The Shipment of Wuyuan Zicha Tea is Still Strong <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Mountain households in Wuyuan County have been picking Zicha tea for ten days. The needs of various firms are also strong. The price has been raised to 7 *jiao* per *jin*. Since the Shanghai telegram reported a drop in the price of Zhenmei tea by 50 or 60 *liang*, the firms have been accepting it, uniformly lowering the price to 5 *jiao* per *jin*. The firms that lack tea have a large demand for the abundant shipment of Zicha tea. There are occasional secret bids of 6 *jiao* to search for goods. In recent days, mountain households have been picking tea continuously. General tea merchants are also searching for goods overnight. The shipment is very strong. Judging from the concentration of Zicha tea growth on the tea trees, there is still a large amount available for picking and production.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Luzhuang Zhenmei European Sales Slightly Active <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Baochang, Yongxing, Duder, and other firms in Luzhuang, Zhenmei, and green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other places all had purchases. Other merchants also sent many telegrams, and the market was slightly more active than before. Among them,抽芯 goods were particularly popular, but sales bids tended to be weak. There were sporadic transactions of Zhenmei, Xiumei, Gongxi, and other green teas. Gongxi saw a drop of 14 or 15 *liang*. Zhenmei and Xiumei also fell by 5 or 6 *liang*. The green tea market is still difficult to be optimistic about. Both Chinese and foreign tea merchants hope that the British and American exchange rates will stabilize quickly to determine the final direction.</p>

The price of New York sugar futures for September was 1.31, and for December was 1.40, each down 2 *fen* from the previous telegram. The price for March next year was 1.48, and for May was 1.54, also each down 1 *fen*. The prices of current and forward sugar in Java were both 8.125, with no increase or decrease from the previous price. The guild market's planning was quiet, and there were few transactions. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse grain white sugar was still bid at 11 *liang* and 2 *qian*, and high-quality coarse grain was 11 *liang* and 3 *qian*. No. 20 medium grain white sugar was 10 *liang* and 6 *qian*. Transactions were scarce. The market shape was sluggish. The import and export of Japanese sugar was also lazy.

<p>Yesterday, the Guangbang firms in the North Market transported ten boxes of new dried lychees again. Samples were immediately shown. The color was still good, but the body was very soft. This was because they were transported to Shanghai early to catch the new season. Then, it was acquired by a certain firm in the South Market at 38 *liang*, and the trend was stable.</p>

<p>In recent days, the weather has been hot, and the transaction of wool goods and flannels has predictably decreased. Most of what was opened in the guild were writing goods. Yesterday, only small hats and flannels were selling quite lively. The hat workshops in Chenghuang Temple and Jiumudi on this street, and Sanguantang in Hongkou, all had needs. Goods ranging from 1 *liang* and several *qian* to 4 *liang* of silver were all being opened. The spot goods and those with an extension of the due date were split evenly.

<h3 id="e187">On Figure Painting <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— By Kinoshita Takanori, translated by Chen Bao Yi</p>
<p>...This is to have me explain the techniques of figure painting, in an easy-to-understand manner, to the extent that even amateurs (non-specialists) can understand.</p>
<p>However, it is said that normally when starting to learn painting, one starts with still life, then landscapes, and then figures, in that order. Figure painting is comparatively the most difficult, because during sketching, figures cannot be kept still like still life. Moreover, even a slight error can be noticed and felt to be inappropriate, so it is not easy to achieve satisfactory results... Therefore, being able to paint figure paintings normally is considered like graduating. However, if we try to paint various kinds of paintings, even seemingly easy still life paintings or figure paintings, we eventually feel unsure which one is ultimately more difficult.</p>
<p>Therefore, regardless of landscape, regardless of still life, the main thing is that we can create good paintings, and that will do.</p>
<p>As for saying...how should still life paintings be painted to become good paintings, how should landscape paintings be painted, and how should figure paintings be painted to be good... These kinds of questions... However, I feel that there is no fixed and unchanging rule in painting that dictates how a certain kind of painting must be painted with a certain technique. Moreover, what kind of painting is considered a "good painting"? This question is not as easy to resolve as it sounds... This, I don't know how to explain, and other than saying that it is difficult to explain, there is no way.</p>
<p>Now, what I want to say to painting students is... if you want to paint, then first pick up the palette and brush, stand in front of the canvas, express what you want to depict, that which stirs your artistic feelings, and paint it on the canvas. By pursuing what you want to express, "technique" will naturally emerge. The deeper the pursuit, the better the painting will ultimately be.</p>
<p>But, now if you ask me... "You often paint figure paintings, so what order do you follow when painting?"... Since that's the case, I might as well reveal my own immature experience. I would be fortunate if it could benefit the readers.</p>
<p>...Let's talk about my experience.</p>
<p>When I paint, I rarely think about theory.</p>
<p>Now, suppose I am painting a half-body portrait of a woman. Let's talk about the order of painting... At first, from the expression on the face, the color of the skin, and the feeling of the body, I look for a figure that I want to paint. Then, I ask her to settle into a pose, and then I pay attention to the background and the colors of the clothes, the color of the face, the overall harmony, the shape of the pose, etc., and make adjustments.</p>
<p>Then, based on this, I select the size and shape (e.g., square or rectangular) of the canvas and determine the layout of the figure on the canvas. Once that's settled, I first start painting with "harmony" and "tone" that come from the contrast of colors.</p>
<p>At the beginning, I often start by painting the hair, the color of the hairline and forehead, and the color of the background, to create the basic tone of the entire picture... I often do it this way, proceeding with a feeling of understanding "nature," and always keeping "the reality of the object" in mind. I pursue the mass of the object according to the harmony of colors. However, if I continue to paint like this for three days, the tone becomes chaotic in the middle, and I eventually fail... This is my experience.</p>
<p>I was once asked... "What colors do you use for the color of your background?" Although I painted this color there, I remember answering him like this... "I'm not sure, it seems like Moir do Pecho, Ochre, Jauoe, B1, and Ceruleum are mixed in." I thought that rather than forgetting what colors I mixed, it was that I hadn't paid attention to this point in the first place.</p>
<p>Just like this, I am unconscious when I paint. Therefore, it is difficult for me to explain the order of painting. The explanation above seems to be of no help.</p>
<p>Although the above is titled a talk on figure painting, I have said that there is no fixed and unchanging technique in terms of technique. However, since ancient times, not limited to figure painting, many painters have been troubled by painting and have made various considerations, and have seen famous paintings, and have separated their theories to explain the method of painting... Naturally, we also know that even if we paint according to theory, we may not create a good painting. However, I believe that if we use theory as a reference, we can benefit a lot. Here, it would be best to describe this so-called "technique." However, "technique" is not a simple thing, so I will have to leave it for another opportunity to describe it again.</p>
<p>Literary Anecdotes</p>
<h3 id="e188">Masculine Literature <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Xiao</p>
<p>When the Greek poet Fheuos Rigas looked down from the peak of Mount Asos, he shouted with tears in his eyes,</p>
<p>"It is not the time to cry, it is the time to do!"</p>
<p>"Cry" is a feminine action, "do" is a masculine action, "cry" literature is feminine literature, "do" literature is masculine literature.</p>
<p>The style of the work shows a kind of passionate stimulation, which invisibly inspires and moves people greatly, as solemn and great as the sun god climbing out of Mount Olympus, and at the same time, it is a yearning for the pursuit of strength. This is a symbol of "masculine" literature.</p>
<p>Now, we know that the nation originating from the Pamir Plateau is approaching a stage of danger and turmoil. It is extremely clear that it is absolutely not easy to achieve the hope of freedom and equality by not "doing" but only dreaming of peaceful means and passive resistance. Therefore, in this situation, all that belongs to courageously moving forward, is rich in stimulation, | masculine literature, is an extreme need at the moment. However, in the past, it has given us disappointment. Except for those articles that throw life into a glass of wine, entrust life to the velvet-like breast of a woman, and gently wither with self-pity, what we hope for has never been seen.</p>
<p>Recently, after reading the two novels in the fifth issue of "Avant-Garde Monthly," that is exactly what I felt in my heart. One is "On the Longhai Line" by Huang Zhenxia, and the other is "A Momentary Revolution" by Wan Guo'an. Both of these are literary works depicting war, just as Dr. Li said, "It is not the time to cry, it is the time to do!" Works with this nature appear in China, a country of moderation and peace. This phenomenon has given us a bit of joy in loneliness, because what we need now is precisely this kind.</p>
