<p>第十一條外、其他若干國政府並援引巴黎非戰公約第二條、因此特回顧、</p>
<p>（一）該决議案簽字各國所予之担任、尤其爲日代表聲明日政府願依滿州日僑生命財産之安全上所獲切實担保之比例、繼續儘速撤退軍隊至鐵路區域、及中國代表聲明中政府願担負鐵路區域外日僑生命財産之安全責任、並所予意在切實保護滿洲日僑之諾言各節、</p>

<p>本會（五）主張中日政府應立即派代表恊定關於撤兵各點之施行細則、並接收已撤兵之土地、庶可進行無碍、</p>
<p>本會（六）主張中日政府於撤軍完成後、即直接開議雙方間各懸案、尤其是因近來事件而起、及關於現有困難、及因滿洲鐵路問題而發生者之案件、爲此旨趣、本會建議雙方應設立一種和解委員會、或類此之永久機關、</p>
<p>本會（七）决定休會至十一月十六日、屆時將再研究時局、但本會許議長有權於其認爲須從速召集時、得提早召集之、</p>
<p>中國總代表施肇基評論此議决案、謂已提出遠大而重要之問題此、案切實聲稱、日軍必須於十一月十六日以前完全撤盡渠已注意及此、此案與中國所請求者相差甚遠故渠請梢緩時日、俾渠得有時間聽取本國政府之意見、渠又悉行政會將休會三星期、渠直至今日、始見决議案原文、故渠在集會以前、不及電告南京政府云、日總代表芳澤稱、行政會可確信一事、即日本在滿無土地野心是但渠不能定一鐵路區域外日軍完全撤退之切實日期日本因滿洲狀况擾亂、謹可依照保護日僑事之進行撤退軍隊云、芳澤繼陳述日軍在滿之重大利益、詳叙滿洲之現狀、及滿洲護路日兵之被攻擊、並評論中國境内之反日運動、芳澤指反日運動僅爲火上加油、芳澤又表示中國可與日本直接談判之希望、芳澤並稱近有許多日韓人民逃入南滿鐵路區域、查在滿日本人民不下一百二十萬、人芳澤旋追述一九二七年各國估據上海事、謂當年上海情形、比諸今日滿洲現狀、不可同日而語、唯中國方面之好意、方可便利日軍之撤退、未稱、渠保留俟研究此案後再對此案表示意見之權云、施肇基因議長允其暫緩表示意見、以待政府訓令之請、特向議長道謝、並聲明俟接到訓令後、即向議長接洽、施博士以激昻之詞聲明滿洲時局、係日本行爲之結果、渠保留於研究日總代表頃所發之言論後、他日再行駁復之權、芳澤於此、立起發言、謂渠亦保留對於施博士驳復言論加以考察之權云、會塲諸人聞芳澤保留之說以大笑報之、議長白里安提議明日午後五時再舉行行政會公開會議、中日代表皆贊成、屆時衆望施博士可已接到中政府之訓示、而芳澤亦可已接到東京訓令尙未完畢之一部份矣、行政會甚關重要之會議、於是告終旁聽席爲人擁滿、對於會議進行、屏息以聽、爲注意、行政會各會員現信彼等之努力、必可成功、美國之參加行政會、可見其世界和平必須維持之决心、此乃最可使人興奮之景象、英人方面以爲行政會大可休會、雖行政會必爲人指斥、責其迄未覓得解决方法、但須知國聯職務、非强迫一種協定、但運用輿論、以導成一種協定耳、今料掌握此爭點之國、可聽從理論之聲、此未可視爲不近情理、况若事變暴發、則其結果徒增一般經濟與金融之衰落、而釀成全世界之禍患耳、英代表李定對外國新聞記者發表關於滿洲時局之談片、謂渠鑒於已成工作、對於前途甚有希望、九月以後時局已有變遷、從前咄咄逼人之戰機、現已挽回惟此時局、殆爲國聯從未有之最困難時局、故國聯所已辦之事實、未可忽視也云、英人方面亦皆謂行政會解决滿洲危局之建議、不容人漠視、行政會决議案所言及之各國代表以監視中國履行其保護日僑安全之佈置者、將爲各國在滿之文武官員、如陸軍隨員·及領事等、據可恃方面稱今日會議旣畢、發現一種特異事態中國與日本俱未發切實詳細之要求、而所謂日本提出之五項基本要點、以此爲對華直接談判之先决條件者、行政會竟毫無所聞因是之故、行政會不可不擬定實際的議案、以九月三十日之議案比較之、則今日之議案有可注意者、以其較前有所增減也、今日議案言及巴黎公約與九國公約、旣增重此案之力量、復擴大此案之根據、此爲前案所未有者、日軍完全撤盡之日期、現已切實定爲十一月十六日、並主張在軍隊撤盡後、開始直接談判、而非兩事同時並作、此乃饜滿中國要求之一點、今日議案未有外人監視日本撤軍之建議、但請中國許外國代表視察日僑安全保障辦法之實施、雖中日政府於日軍全撤後即直接談判懸案、但議案中未曾言及現有條約下權利之承認、所謂懸案者、包括近來案件、及關於滿洲鐵路之現有困難、至於東京所傳日本要求賠償日資所造各路之損失之說、則議案迄未提及、中日代表今夜皆未準備作議案原文之批評、須俟其政府訓令到後、始可表示其意見、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　行政會原定今日午後、五時開會、今已展至六時十五分開會、因中代表施肇基尙未接到其政府訓令也、據中國代表團聲稱、政府要人刻正在上海開會、政府訓令恐今晚未必到也、（二十三日路透社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>國聯之决議案</h3>
<p>國聯行政會自十月十三再度集會以至今。日忽忽又已旬餘當會議重集之初。各國代表似都極爲昻奮。一若有拔除當前困局之决心者。會議數日。情勢依舊。毫無開展。乃復一致引領美國。企盼美代表之正工列席。以增厚其聲援。但自美代表正式出席以至最近。除由非戰公約之簽字國。依據非戰公約。各致送一備忘錄於中日兩國而外。仍無以抑制日人繼續發展之暴行。解决東北之嚴重局勢。捉襟見肘。前昨兩日消息。更非常暗淡。大有束手無策爲强權懾服之勢。乃今日消息傳來。國聯又奮然鼓其勇氣。於行政會公開會議全塲空氣萬分緊張之時。白里安從容登臺。於報告中日兩方所致之文件後。並又報告密會通過之决議案。其要點。一促日政府立即開始並不斷的撤兵。至下屆十一月十六日開會前撤完。二請中政府籌畫可保障該處日僑生命財産安全之布置。並容許國聯代表之視察。三中日兩國立即派代表協定關於撤兵各點之施行細則。並接收已撤兵之土地。四中日於撤軍完成後。即直接開議雙方間各懸案。尤其是因近來事件起後所發生之困難問題。建議雙方設立一種和解委員會。或類此之永久機關。有此决議案。而數日來愁悶不展之局勢。得到初步之開發惟是此種决議案。國聯方面。未能課暴日以何種責任。固未能滿找全國人民之意。惟爲尊重國聯意思計。是否容納國聯之要求。吾人不能預料。吾人今日所急欲知者。假使日本不接受國聯之决議。而仍堅持其基本要點之主張者。國聯果能根據會章。以斷然之手段處理之乎。抑或躊躇却顧。不即將决議案實行。而仍將出以延宕乎。此點不僅爲中日交涉之成敗關頭而亦即國聯威信之存亡關頭。蓋世界和平破裂之危險。已到最後時期能否挽救。在此一舉。國聯諸代表。其速一鼓作氣。奮勇努力。而勿再如從前之且前且却。坐誤此急要之時機。</p>

<p>迄今猶未獲成功、昨日下午開理事會議時、白里安宣稱、理事會所擬調解方式、雖得各理事贊成、仍未獲中日兩政府之同意、因此會中遂决定將最後會議、展至星期五下午五時舉行、而中日代表對此展期亦表同意、嗣於深夜白里安又宣稱、理事會接受中日代表請求、將所擬調解方式之决議案、延至星期五下午公開大會討論、按昨日理事會係下午四時二十分開會、美代表吉爾白亦列席、當開會前半小時、芳澤以渠猶未能完全闡釋東京訓令爲理由請求展期、但總秘書德魯蒙未允、迨後芳澤延遲十五分鐘始到開會後芳澤聲稱、渠仍保留日本在法律方面反對美代表之列席、反對邀請非會員國參加討論之舉、雖然渠對於美代表吉爾白君表示歡迎、日本常懷與美保持和平關係之决心、吉爾白答稱渠完全重視日本之反對、知其純在法律方面而非出於政治方面、今聞芳澤君宣稱日美間和好關係、甚爲欣慰、美國亦同具此心云云、主席白里安乃詳述根據非戰公約所取之步骤、謂各簽約國業已同式照會分送中日兩政府、於是中國施總代表送出中政府致法覆照、並稱、中國完全信任理事會之努力、極希望國聯將在遠東樹立永久和平之制度、白里安又稱、自上次理事會議以來、余常與施博士及芳澤君商榷、兩君俱表示力謀解决之最大願望、不容時局益增嚴重、無如此次局勢不同尋常、加以道路　遠、交通不便但無論如何、必須覓一工具、至少可藉以暫時制馭時局今雙方旣能抱和平解决之精神、自不能不得良好結果、惟當前最困難處、在覓一方式、余信今日提出之决議案、俟最後討論與通過之後、將可達到所冀之目的、中日見解仍無異於前、但理事會已得保證目下不致有戰爭危險、此乃吾人第一注念之事、日本堅稱無佔取中國領土之心、而有撤兵之意、其願望仍在保僑、中國聲稱準備研究而予保護日人之保障、因此吾人必須覓一方式或草一决議案、以安定目前之時局、使勿生變云云、日代表芳澤演說稱、中國最好莫如與日本開始直接外交談判、表示其解决滿洲糾紛之誠意、又謂渠不能予撤兵時取、於是中國施代表立請理事會予以研究日本演說、及將决議案原文請訓本國政府之時間、謂至星期五開會時恐未必能得南京回訓、至芳澤演說、其扼要語略謂余不能同意於規定撤兵日期、因日僑之安全恃於軍、但日軍現正陸續撤回、而此時撤兵之遲早、大半繫乎中政府與中國人民之態度、又詳述滿洲目前狀况、謂此即所以使日本不能規定完全撤兵之時期者、但日本仍抱有以最迅速而可能方法、撤退其軍隊之志願、日本希望用可以一勞永逸之方法撤退其軍隊、目下僅有少數軍隊留駐中國境内、但希望能得中國之合作與善意、使其　駐時間縮至極短云云、中國施總代表當即通知理事會、據北寗路員報告皇姑屯站日兵撤去後、仍代以日憲兵、巨流河站日軍仍未撤一人、又施氏於要求理事會議略事展緩、俾可將會中所提决議案向南京請訓時曾稱、此項决議、案産生有力與遠大之結果、雖非最後决議但曾規定三星期之時間、作爲日本完全撤兵之期、此固與中國認爲時局之所需要者相去甚遠、但實爲理事會一月來爲保障和平與獲得公道計努力之所得、故應再予以一日之討論、然後付諸表决云云、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<h3>特外委會討論國聯議案</h3>
<p>擬定致施代表覆電</p>
<p>（南京）國聯調解中日糾紛、再度集會醖釀十日之久、始於前日五巨頭秘議决定辦法五項、已見另電我國代表施肇基電府請示、二十三特外會開會、將施代表電報提出討論、經各委長時間之討研、僉謂國聯如認爲公正之解决辦法時、中國一本初旨絶對尊重公意之判斷嗣復逐條討論、簽注詳細步驟、當場草擬致施代表之覆電、預計此電到日内瓦時、尙在公開大會之前數小時、（二十三日專電）</p>
<h3>日本堅持附條件的撤兵</h3>
<p>再三聲明條約權利</p>
<p>迄未改變原態度</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯中人聞日政府將有條件的接受理事會所擬三星期内撤盡日軍决議案、爲之大慰但亦承認理事會之棘手問題、依然存在因中國力爭日本所稱在滿條約權利不生効力、故其結果料中國代表施肇基博士非向本國政府請訓後、不能接受該决議案、而中國政府之同意、則恐什九屬於不可能、至國聯會章雖授權評議會考慮不合現情之條約、但此項權力自國聯成立以來備受猛烈攻擊、拉丁美洲旣反對重行考慮、搭克那阿利加條約於前、而歐洲諸大國又深畏巴黎和約被人提出重加考慮、不願見此項權力之實施、因此現信中國如請國聯評議會表示對於日本在滿條約權利不生効力之意見、國聯將未必樂於有所說明、即使能獲有若干結果亦必經年累月非一時間所能考慮畢事也現日本對於理事所擬决議案、卽表示有條件之接受、預料今日下午該决議案將見修改、以適應日本之讓步、但其最後表决時、料僅能得大多數之同意、中國旣根據會章十一欵、陳訴照章應得一致同意、此項决議案如僅得大多數同意、恐祇能留爲一種决議案、未必能見諸實施、然旣有十書國之赞成、亦自有一種道德力量云、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日政府今日訓令芳澤向行政會聲明、如中國允承認其條約之約束、並取銷抗日運動、則日本亦允開始將滿洲軍隊退入鐵路區域、儘力於三星期内完成撤兵之舉、日本雖仍拒絶承認先撤兵、後開談判之原則、而今日致芳澤之訓令、可望及時傳至日内瓦、於明日午後提交行政會衆視此舉爲日本方面之重要讓兵、蓋日本迄今拒絶考慮時限問題也、此項讓步、乃備在國聯中切實聲明日本雖令中國承認其條約約束之根本重要、此間視中國此項承認、爲滿洲全案永遠解决之要素、日本對於撤兵事、雖準備作有條件之讓步、但須切實聲明者明日行政會重行集議時、日本不能切實許約於十一月十六日完全撤兵之舉、蓋撤兵之進行、須視中國担保撤兵後維持治安與秩序之願意與能力而定也、再須聲明者、此次致芳澤之新訓令、並非新方案僅爲對於德魯蒙之第一方案再作讓步耳、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　今晨日本政界因國聯行政會提出非其意料所及之議案、大爲驚愕、官塲謂行政會因何動機、有所提案、殊難索解、日政府已接受行政會議長及秘書長之建議準備修正一種方案、俾可爲國聯所接受故日本官塲方自信修正方案一經接受、各事即可順利進行、國聯秘書長德魯蒙曾準備國聯所可接受之三種不同方案、日政府已訓令芳澤聲明日本準備第一方案、而略加修正、與白里安芳澤二人根據五項基本要點而議定者、實質相同此種訓令、明晨當可送達芳澤、故日政府以爲行政會所提出者、定必爲德魯蒙所擬之第一方案、今悉行政會不獨决定實行其第三方案所擬之手續、····即中日如皆不依允他項方案、行政會將擬定决議案、而將此整個問題在公開會議中討論之、···且於議案中列入日本絶對不能依允之主張、乃大爲失望、據日内瓦傳來之報章消息、國聯方面主張日本限期撤兵之輿論、日漸有力、今晨各報皆有評論反對限期撤兵、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯方面見日代表之倔强態度、故對於今日行政會會議之結果、頗多推測之詞、查提交行政會以作滿案解决根據之草案、須得一致之同意方可有效、是以如日代表果反對之、則此案經此頓挫、除於十一月十六日或提早召集會議、重行考慮外、别無成就、目前南京與廣州政界要人集議於上海、衆料中政府對於此案之復文、今日或不能到日内瓦、果爾、則行政會今日或不開會、日代表團接東京傳來如中國承認條約拘束、日本願開始撤兵之說頗爲恍惚、查行政會决議案中未言及條約拘束、而承認現有條約下權利一語乃東京所傳五項基本要點之第五項、但據此間日代表之言、則在日内瓦談判之任何階級中、從未發生此項問題、因行政會始終主張日内瓦所談之事、應以撤兵與停止激昻運動爲限、至於其他爭點、應於日後由雙方解决之也聞日本現仍不改其態度、今晨路透訪員聞諸日本代表團、除非日政府改變其態度、芳澤料政府未必有新訓令到此、據芳澤推測、日政府未必改變其態度芳澤所接訓令、囑其維持原有態度、故所謂新訓令者、渠尙無所聞、亦不能决定今日行政會之會議將有何種結果也、今日行政會能否結束、殊有疑問如開會而不能結束、則最後一幕之會議、將於明日行之、衆料會議之進行不能拖長至本星期外也、傳說行政會或須延期舉行、議長白里安或將不即提出决議案、中國代表以南京廿二日來電送交國聯秘書長、日人現通知張學良、告以其家具及私人物件四百十七具、已由大連運抵塘沽、日人事前曾通知張學良、謂日人不許其復回瀋陽、故將送出其家具等物、南京來電並稱日人曾刦掠其他官員住宅與兵工廠、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>美取旁觀態度</h3>
<p>華盛頓人士之解釋</p>
<p>多方面對國聯失望</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　美國對於滿案、忽現束手旁觀之象、據此間人士解釋、此爲天然之理、蓋國聯現方根據會章處置該問題、美國實無權過問也美國之淡漠、並非缺乏同情心、美國之請中日兩國注意凱洛格非戰公約下之義務、已盡其職責、今苟非國聯請美國在保衞和平計畫中合作、則美國無庸取更堅决之態度（、二十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　美政府對於滿案意見、又有一度小變遷、昨日方以爲國聯於調解上正有進步、今日則稱、美政府所得印象、滿洲時局愈益糾紛、蓋滿洲日軍又以飛機擲彈之報告與國聯所遇困難、皆足使國務院發生時局嚴重之印象、現國務院顯似靜待國聯最後切實行動後、再行决定美國是否應變更原來地位、但有許多方面對於國聯頗覺失望、以爲雖有美國贊成、仍未能商得一調解方式、（二十二日國民社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　中國已正式申謝美國十月二十日照會請中國注意凱洛格非戰公約下義務之厚意、（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<h3>英代表李定離日内瓦返國</h3>
<p>任務由薛西爾代理</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯理事會之非常會議、今夕已開始、英國外相李定已於今夕離日内瓦返英、新聞記者於彼臨行前、曾與李氏談話彼不願作負責之談話、但謂滿洲時局現似無實在之進步云、李定氏去後其任務將由薛西爾代理、薛氏於明日公開會議席上將代表英國出席、而明日大會之後、理事會即將延期至十一月十六日再行重開故此屆理事會會議、可謂一無成績、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>國聯行政會兩决議案比較</h3>
<p>（南京）　二十三日日内瓦電、二十二日行政院大會所提出之解决東三省問題决議草案、與九月三十日國聯决議相對照、極有興趣、第一案中提及九國公約及非戰公約、此爲上次决議所無者、足以增加决議之力量、而置决議於較廣基礎之上、第二、草案二十二日確定日軍完全撤退日期、至遲爲十一月十六日、較上次决議之空泛語句遠勝第三、中日直接交涉、在日軍撤退之後而不與撤軍同時進行、此爲滿足華方要求之一要點第四、華方要求日本撤軍時由國聯派員監視、雖未肯定、但中立國可派員到中國、所派人員、並得觀察接由佔領區域及保護日僑等手續之實行第五、决議草案未提及承恝現行條約規定權利之問題、先請中日兩方解决一切懸案、包括一切與南滿各鐵路有關之案件在内、今晚中日兩國代表團對此莫案、均不願表示意見、因彼等正候政府訓令、在訓令未到前、不能置可否、（二十三日中央社電）</p>

<p>日來蔣介石氏下野的聲浪。甚囂塵上。我早中華民國的國民一分子。當然有一分子的發言權。表示我個人的意思。我以爲在這外寇日深國勢危急之際。蔣氏不但不應當下野。并該「上塲」。怎麽呌做「上塲」呢。就是身上戰塲去。領導全中國愛國的軍民。殺開一條血路。與暴横無理的倭人作殊死戰。</p>

<h3>農夫之聲</h3>
<p>四年前，聽仲香唱保定農夫歌，聲調悲壯，令人奮發，可惜原製之詞不能宣達歌中精神。我早想依調另製一詞爲現代農人一鳴不平。去年適有友人從中原與西北考察回來，對該地農人生活和我說得很詳細。據這位朋友說，山東，河南，陜西，甘肅等省之自耕農不願自己有田地。何以呢？因爲在天災人禍中，有田不易耕種，還須納糧。錢糧不但是一個錢不能少而且是寅年要納卯年糧，不，寅年要納午年糧。有的地方拿田契送人也没有人要；没有人要，只好駝重利，賣兒女去納糧。雖然自己有田還是代較富的地主耕種。這又是什麽道理？因爲代人耕種，每日尙可得工錢餬口。若是自耕，則必等到秋收，始有米吃，人早己要化爲白骨了。所以不得已弄掉自己的田去耕别人的田。這是一種什麽現象啊！我聽了這番話便依保定農夫歌調爲我們的不幸的同胞寫了一幅小影：</p>
<p>「穿的破布衣；</p>
<p>吃的草根麵；</p>
<p>背上背着没賣掉的孩兒</p>
<p>餓煞喊爹爹。</p>
<p>牽着牛大哥，</p>
<p>去耕别人田。</p>
<p>太陽晒在光頭，</p>
<p>心裏如滾油煎。</p>
<p>九折三分，</p>
<p>駝利納糧錢。</p>
<p>良友變成匪，</p>
<p>問在何處伸寃？</p>
<p>人面蝗蟲飛滿天</p>
<p>飛滿天！</p>
<p>無有農夫誰能活天地間！」</p>
<h3>私通敵國者之龜鑑</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>自暴日突然侵略我東省後。凡吾國人莫不抱同仇敵愾一致之决心以奔赴。誠以亡國之慘。奴隸之辱。已迫於眉睫。而猶欲偷安旦夕。以冀僥倖於他人之或我恤者。雖天下之至愚。全無血氣者。亦且知其不可得。迺有熙洽其人者。甘與日軍勾通。計畫組吉林非法官署。居然委命下吏。而張海鵬身爲吾國軍長。竟爲敵人効命願爲鷹犬。此兩人非特吾國之敗類。而認賊作子。罪不容恕。因憶二十年前有甘心賣國者二。一爲「趙郁卿。」「焦滇。」其通敵之原因不一。而其歸獄。皆置之於法。則無稍異故追述之。以爲今之猶有親日派者。懸一前車。</p>
<p>趙郁卿充俄國軍事偵探。以重資購軍諮海陸軍密摺輸情於俄。嗣事洩。政府赫然震怒。經軍事裁判。按照陸軍章程。用軍律懲辦。旋判决交法監禁終身。報紙紀載其事。咸冠以賣國奴三字。蓋懲之也。此清末宣統二年五月間事。</p>
<p>焦滇將三省軍用地圖。盜賣與日人。此案起因。由其妾所主使。妾本日婦也。焦留學日本時所娶。已生一子。殆案破露。即挾資携子而逃。乃卒被逮正法。焦初爲京部人員先以乏資運動。不能到部。因爲此例行逆施之舉。然以數千金而斷送一命。論者惡其人而憐其愚。蓋當時道勝銀行之契劵。其充滿於朝貴之槖中者。斗量車載。而帷幄訐謨。外人直探囊而取之。如外府然。其於焦滇。猶罪之小焉者。此清宣統三年間事。</p>
<p>觀此。可知清季紀綱已墜。正氣盡銷。而懲不忠於國。以媚敵人者。猶能執法不阿。以隨其後。爲世所戒。噫今之熙洽張海鵬。其罪當可逭乎。吾讀史至漢中平四年。金城賊圍傅爕於漢陽。北胡騎數千隨攻郡。皆懷爕恩。共於城外叩頭。求送爕歸鄉里。爕幼子幹曰。「國家昏亂。遂令大人不容於朝。今天下巳叛。而兵不足自守鄉里。羗胡先被恩德。欲令棄郡而歸。願必許之。徐至鄉里。率厲義徒。見有道而輔之。以濟天下」。玄未終。爕慨然而歎曰。「别成。汝知我死耶。蓋聖逆節。次守節世亂不能養浩然之志。食祿又欲避其難乎。吾行何之。必死於此矣」。斯爲何等氣概。所謂頭可斷。血可流。軀壳可糜爛。唯此一點愛國之熱心。終不可摩滅。吾恐後日熙洽海鵬之接踵以起義。故又錄此一段史蹟。以告今之爲國執殳前驅者。其勿爲敵所屈。與爲國人所戮。而貽千萬世秉筆者之所誅伐。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>烏鴉音樂隊鳥類中的音樂隊。西方人最推重夜鶯。東方人最推重黄鸝。都可在詩人們的作品中瞧到的烏鴉的聲音。牙牙刺耳。决不能使人動聽。并且東方的舊俗。以早起聽得鴉鳴爲不祥之兆。更安有欣賞之可言。那麽這烏鴉音樂隊。是怎麽一回事呢。原來英國吉斯德Ghester地方。有一家牛奶房的主人弼海爾氏。F·Bithell他豢養着四頭烏鴉。二雄二雌。第一頭名傑甘。第二頭名傑米。都是雄的。第三頭名瓊妮。第四頭名蓓蓓。都是雌的。他自己本來愛好音樂。便日夜的訓練他們。組成一個音樂隊。共用鐘·鼓·鐃鈸·三角形樂器·四種。内中最有天才的。要算是蓓蓓。伊能弄八隻鐘。倘有人請伊奏那「家中老輩」“TbeoldFollsatHome”一曲時。伊先還含羞不肯。倘再鼓勵伊一下。就會跳到那鐘旁去。用伊的嘴逐一叩鐘。叮叮噹噹的十分好聽。并且調門一些不錯。</p>
<h3>女子戰地救護隊演習記</h3>
<p>— 芝實</p>
<p>自暴日侵略遼吉。進窺蒙黑以還。滬上男女學校。胥有悲壯熱烈之救國運動。本埠西門兩江女子體育學校。亦依照市黨部執行委員會頒布之工作原則。組織抗日救國會。其成立之戰地救護隊。尤具堅决果敢之精神。授課月餘。茲已訓練完成。特於本月二十一日下午二時。假天后宫橋市商會議事廳。舉行宣誓典禮。以示其願以眞誠之决心爲國服務也。</p>
<p>行禮如儀後。由該校校長陸禮華。致開會詞。報告組織經過。謂並於一日晚十時許。測騐各隊員果有以身許國之志願否。臨時動員。出發之某某地。而同學諸君。竟能於十數分鐘間。集合竣事。預備開拔。爭先恐後。未有一人躑躅不前者。雖然。同學之毅力。固可嘉尙。辱蒙婦孺醫院二女士於百忙中爲敝校各隊員熱心敎授。乃得具此初步救護之成績。其情尤不可没。於由市黨部代表。市敎局代表。及該校校董褚民誼氏等訓詞。語多勗勉。切中肯綮。</p>
<p>戰地救護隊。組織内容以五人爲一隊。共三十隊。各衣潔白之看護衣。看護帽。態度從容。幽靜肅穆。一反研習體育運動時手舞足蹈抛球擲棒之故態。隔座某君私語。此所謂「做是官而行是禮」也。演習時。如傷頭者。裏後俯仰仍自如。傷肘者紮綁後。曲屈與平素無異。傷重周身不可動彈。則備一牀。服以被褥衾枕。被褥之上。更蓋以敷汚穢之被褥。以待傷者寢臥。然後徐去傷者衣服及衾被。易以下舖之潔凈者。手術敏捷。傷者似不受絲毫痛苦。敎授二女士。并向衆一一剖白傷之徵重。及救護之繁簡。末謂今日演習者。限於明顯一類。複雜不易供獻於來賓之前者不在此例。引爲遺憾云。</p>
<p>演習畢由主席領導全體隊員。宣讀誓詞。聲振屋宇。頗徵莊嚴壯烈之氣。旋贈二銀盾於兩護士。表示襄贊熱忱。散會後。假市商會大門甬道。與來賓合攝一影。時已夕陽西照矣。</p>

<h3>敲夢的杵（二二）</h3>
<p>— 程瞻廬</p>
<p>陶遲到了這裏，益發知道現在的偉大和悠久！他連呼着三聲！現在萬歲！</p>
<p>他細細考察這座迷惘之宫，建築在華府會議的基礎上，這基礎多麽穩固啊！上面蓋的是和平之瓦；四周，圍的是公理之欄；還加着銅牆鐵壁，都是縮短軍備項下的材料製造的。上面的三字扁額，！靠山堂；兩旁的八字對聯，丨安如泰山，穩如磐石；佐以妙舞，娱以清歌。</p>
<p>他一入了迷惘之宫，他便在現代的洪爐中镕化了！他不知住了多少年，多少月，多少日，多少時；只爲現代的樂園中是廢止年月日時的。他在先，還有些懷疑，他終於深认了：只爲，他自己覺得悠久又悠久，但是，一到了園子裏，晨曦依舊照上碧桃花的最高枝，碧桃花依舊在半開時候，花枝兒依舊在一泓清水的小池中人倒映着，小池中的金魚依舊在戲弄着搖曳的花影；可見，晨光不變，碧桃花不變，花影兒不變，金魚兒不變；這都可以證實這句丨悠久不變的現在。</p>
<p>他被現代潮流衝破了他的志願大本營丨地立志不看肉感小說的；自入了迷惘之宫，非看肉感小說，不足以安慰他現在的心靈！他又立志不聽肉感歌曲的；自入了迷惘之宫，非聽肉感歌曲，不足以鼓舞他現在的興致！其他，一切的一切，他平日所不欲幹，不敢幹，不忍幹的；自入了迷惘之宫，便纊做不欲不幹，不敢不幹，不　不幹了！他以爲，一切肉感文字，是適於現在的作品；他以爲，學校青年不談科學而談戀愛，是現在應有的知識；他以爲，沉悶的科學，是違反人們眼前快樂的不良讀物；他以爲，憂國憂民四個字，是現代詞典中删去的無用名詞：他以爲，利用他國日新月異的舶來品，以點　我們的物質文明，而不必自己設廠製造，這是眼前快樂主義中的適當辦法；　以爲，購買他國日新月異的槍砲子彈，預備大中華兄弟公司拆股時的武器。而不必自己設廠製造，這是但　現在的最經濟辦法！</p>

<h3>銀洋市調劑之困難</h3>
<p>洋厘飛漲三厘</p>
<p>劃頭竟至六錢</p>
<p>市塲概况　連日銀洋市氣緊張、頗爲社會所矚目、前昨兩日形勢、益趨嚴重、昨午集會時間、竟延長一小時之久、始於二時二十餘分鐘散會、就此可知情形之内幕、而當其事者之左右爲難矣、昨午洋厘之漲、純爲小銀行買進所致、蓋亦自保基業範圍而使之然、如果一味吸收、則恐市面更不如今也、</p>
<p>厘拆價格　「洋厘」早市厘價、以人心堅昻、固較前早好起半厘、爲七錢二分七厘一毫二忽半、午市又値小銀行大舉收買、轉使賣方絶跡、結果厘價飛漲三厘、爲七錢三分○一毫二忽半、形勢之緊不亞於銀根也、「錢拆」早午兩市仍爲五錢、雖與前日類同、而内幕形勢之緊張、殆難言喻、劃頭加水、初竟有人做開六錢者、迨至結果則爲三錢二三分、銀行掛牌二錢、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋早午兩市、故因交易全無、故市價一致與前日相同、爲六錢五分八厘、廣東小洋早市爲六錢五分四厘半、午市爲六錢五分五厘七毫半、結果較昻一厘二毫半、蓋近日銀根奇緊、此項交易無人問津、即有亦屬寥寥耳、交易早市十萬一角、午市七萬五千角、銅元改長一千文、爲三百七十七千五百文交易二萬九千餘串、</p>
<p>銀洋進出　「銀欵」當此銀根孔亟之候、銀行收解轉使寂寞、華商收解票欵二百八十餘萬、外商收解票欵一百五六十萬、各種貨匯稅什諸欵收解七百餘萬特欵二百餘萬、押欵交易三十餘萬、進倉一百三十萬、錢莊銀公單收解四千七百餘萬、劃頭欵收解四百十餘萬、各路匯欵收解四十餘萬、解現仍有一百餘萬、「洋欵」匯劃票欵、早市做出一百二十三萬五千、午市做出九十二萬、鈔票早市五萬、午市三、萬塲外鈔票早市十二萬五千午市六萬五千、銀行買賣、早市互市七十萬午市買進七十萬賣出僅三十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百八十餘萬、鈔票進出二百餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解四百五十餘萬洋劃頭欵收解二百二十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百五十餘萬小錢莊交易五十餘萬客路去胃五十餘萬、</p>
<h3>證劵债價續疲趨勢略平</h3>
<p>裁兵近期鹽稅遠期跌逾二元</p>
<p>餘小一元左右統稅僅縮數角</p>
<p>昨（二十三日）華商證券交易所各債市况、期市活潑如前前、後市成交踴躍、惟現市則比前日爲清各債券多無交易、在晨初開出時以人心較虚、比前日曾一度續跌頗勁、旋即仍行回高、統觀全日各債券市價之趨勢、始終非常混亂、除數種變動較巨外、餘大致轉前平和、市面情形、似已稍佳、惟較前日僅一九關下月期稍大數角、其他均續下跌、内裁兵十月跌二元六角、鹽稅十一月跌二元三角半、其他亦續小一元左右、惟統稅略縮三四角蓋在昨日内、外交形勢沉悶、無稍發展、一般市場人心、咸頗悲觀故也、觀債市之前途、如外交形勢無轉機、國内時局如無明顯進步、則在交割以前、證券市終將難望轉佳云、計全日現貨交易合僅九千元、期貨上午達九百八十餘萬、後市五百十萬元、合計約達一千五百萬元、中統稅佔三百十餘萬、二○關約二百八十萬、鹽稅亦有二百四十萬元、</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市日懈</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日西路米源略稀、本街交易愈　呆滯、行情高者看定、中關宿次逐步下游、常錫新粳及同里北㘮等粳來貨尙湧價氏二角、窰種紅白稻鄉莊帮略有買進、價無升沉、新陳蘆洋尖因辦胃呆滯、疲落近角、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日交易極淡、早晨臨市者寥寥無幾、市勢以捉摸、新粳頂貨未見變動、普通貨趨代二角、新百哥交易、茶食店動辦甚勁、市形亦挺、陳破礱去路極細、無榮辱、蘆埠尖受新客尖影響、開盤降低一二角變陰二元節節下游、裏路到貨三四十號、河下斛脚約近三千擔、</p>
<h3>洋米國外報漲</h3>
<p>昨日洋米進出兩少因客帮停頓、本街觀望、現貨交易沉寂、昨日祇有本街應酬日輪進口次小絞二百包、價十元零四角半、期貨以國外市價報漲、洋行不再貶價兜攬、故市面轉形穩固、但進户胃口亦呆、統市竟無只包成交云、</p>
<h3>粉市不穩</h3>
<p>洋麥陸續進口：俄麥亦報過剩</p>
<p>昨日粉市又轉平懈之勢、以洋麥報價已回小二三角、兼之所定洋麥、陸續大批進口、目以俄麥尙屬過剩、一旦高昻之後、又難免乘勢來華、故市塲人心不穩、較前日收價、計回跌二三分不等、惟以後遠期月份、因客户又見搶進、市氣又見略振、迨至下午開盤、初仍平軟、後因客户仍進遠期、致又步步回高、惟買氣不暢高度無幾、結果本月份較前日跌一分半、十一十二月份小二厘半、一二月份小五厘、三月份小二厘半、</p>
<h3>遠期麥進户不少</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、因洋麥報小、人心見疲、近遠月份、較前日曾回小二三四分不等、旋以内地帮及本街客户、買氣仍濃、致人心又復漸昻、迨至下午開盤、初亦平定、但一般投機買户、預測定洋麥者、當以銀根關係、决難如幾月前之暢、故遇小即進、頗覺有力、因此遠期反回漲四五分、本月份以交割關係、依然無神、結果本月份較前日小二分、十一月份不動、十二月份大三分、一二月份各漲五分、三月份漲四分云、</p>
<h3>南北貨蜜棗市價每况愈下</h3>
<p>邇來蜜棗銷路愈見沉寂、而市上存底尙多、以致供過於求、市價逐步趨下、昨市行盤、如上莊徽工秃秃僅售二十二兩、蘭谿秃秃較高者二十一兩、次之二十兩、上下檔仍照向例加退、查貨客手貨、成本均昻、故業此者無一不虧耗云</p>
<h3>絲茶歐美絲銷仍清</h3>
<p>昨　　日本埠洋莊絲市、仍趨清堅、緣英倫里昻等處、白廠經廠銷不動、電轉沉寂、紐B級廠經雖有電轉、而來價仍小、上身八十三分匀度價與中身不相上下、廠方虧蝕堪虞、仍無成交、昨祗歐莊補充缺貨計仁記等淮滬白廠經二十包、信孚進白乾經二十包、克昌進粗黄鷥五包、價尙堅定云、</p>
<h3>抽芯珍遐洋銷已有動機</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、婺源屯溪等路抽芯珍眉、英莊錦隆洋行、又復談盤論價、市面已有動機惟行家認盤過低、市况未能發展、針眉·秀眉等項、交易尙不寂寞、售盤亦視前無變動、貢熙一項、日來俄國協助會又告停辦、白頭莊認價亦較前縮緊、茶市依然有跌無漲云、</p>

<h3>煤炭天晴煤屑走銷大暢</h3>
<p>各種白煤屑、近來銷路大暢、綠天時久晴、煤煤屑乾燥、本外各帮、均有大批買進、連日浦東各碼頭裝出現貨、日有四五百噸之多、故售價穩定、計昨市紅峙屑十兩○五錢、馬克屑八兩五錢奉天屑九兩七錢半、山西屑九兩、柳江屑七兩云</p>
<h3>五金花旗白鐵鋒勢稍挫</h3>
<p>花旗白鐵自東貨停止來華後、各帮添辦者十分興旺、因此其趨勢十分鋒俏各花色中如四十八張者、後辦者幾有無貨可購之概、最近趨、勢緣英貨頻疊而到·其價則較美貨稍爲低廉、故採辦莫不踴躍收進、因此美貨出路被其打擊、而標準開價亦因之稍軟、刻如四十八張後擔開十九兩、二十八號十八兩五錢、二十六號十七兩三錢半、二十四號十六兩七錢半、而最近英白鐵市價紅鳥鐵估十七兩七錢半、彗星璜十七兩五錢、二十八號十六兩七錢半、二十六號十五兩三錢半、二十四號十四兩、、以此估盤較美貨爲廉、因此一般客户多樂與購辦、是以美貨出路、不得不稍爲冷落</p>

<h3>粤和平代表汪精衞等重要報告</h3>
<p>昨日下午招待新聞界</p>
<p>以建設求統一</p>
<p>以均權求共治</p>
<p>粤方和平代表汪精衞·孫科·伍朝樞·陳友仁·李文範·鄒魯·等、於昨日下午三時、在戈登路二十九號伍公館、招待新聞界、到各報記者百餘人茶點後、汪精衞·孫科·兩氏相繼報告旋由記者方面叩問各項重要問題、經汪孫陳伍鄒等逐項分任答覆、茲將汪孫重要報告曁問答分誌如左、</p>
<h3>汪精衞先生報告</h3>
<p>各位記者先生、兄弟前天到上海的時候、在碼頭上見到許多位記者先生、當時心裏很感激、但那次時間怱促、未能詳細一一把事情奉告、今天乘這個機會、得和諸位先生聚首一堂、同人等十分欣慰、兄弟在上海的時候、便抱一個意思希望能夠與新聞界諸君很自由的談談、這個機會、今天達到了、關於新聞記載、各地都是一向不自由、因爲要經過檢查的手續、或許有很多消息、會生隔膜、所以也有對各位先生詳談一次的必要、昨天、蔣先生來到上海的時候、同人等曾當面要求、不再檢查報紙使人人有自由發表意志的機會、的制度、這個在建國大綱中已說得很清楚、均權制度、在中國一天未實行、中國的政治糾紛、一天不會停止、必要實行了均權制度之後、政治才能上軌道、然後才不致如民國以來、動不動或借中央集權、而造成獨裁專制的政體、或借地方分權、而造成軍閥割據的局勢、「以建設求統一、以均權求共治、」雖然是兩句不同的話、其實其意義之重要、是一樣的、因爲這同是治國的基本原則、必使這兩個原則、能夠實行、然後財政外交種種事項、才有辦法、五月二十八、廣東成立國民政府之後、一面都本着這個宗旨去做、我們之所以不輕易動兵、也是這個原故、從五月到現在十月、五個月以來、兩方雖採取對抗的形勢、却未有兵禍發生、這是較可以安慰的事、廣東在這幾個月的時間、已經開辦了地方自治、相信最近的不久、或許有成績、告訴各位、給各位去批評、我們正當辦理這些事情的時候、寗方派代表到廣州來、表示希望和平統一的意思、和平統一、本是我們的希望、所以以建設求統一以均權求共治汪精衞</p>
<p>蔣先生昨天已經切實地答復、這點是不成問題了、這點已然做到、以後便有機會時常把消息供給各新聞界、同時以後又可以有接受各位新聞界批評的機會、這是痛快的一件事、關於幾年來的事情、當然不能在這短少時間能夠說清楚的、幾年來黨國的分崩離析、是萬不得已的事、如果還有萬不得已的原因、斷不會有今日的事情、中央非常會議和國民政府、是五月二十七·二十八先後在廣州成立的、當粤國府委員同人就職的時候、曾經有兩句頗重要的說話、就是「以建設求統一、以均權求共治、」自民國成立以來、從來大家都以爲武力統一、是統一的不二法門其實如果統一、是非用武力不可的、那末現在是民國二十年了、那裏還會有如此現狀、事實上愈以武力統一、結果、離目的愈遠、武力之不能求得統一、祗要用事實就可以證明、所以非常會議同人、覺得今後要統一國家、便有改變方法之必要、所以粤國府成立以後、一向便不專注意以武力的準備、所注意的、一向都在地方的建設、地方建設有成功、這個效力、比武力作用還要大、因爲若純靠武力、結果、可以使財政及其他諸端、都發生紊亂、財政紊亂、什麽事便無從去做、百姓們對政府不生信仰、所以必要在建設上做工夫國家錢財、拿來用在建設上、給百姓謀的幸福、一方固然可使百姓們信託政府、地方政府的人民、也可以信託自己、建設事業有成、統一然後才有求得之希望、民國二十年來、都是忽略建設工作、才有這樣分崩離析之結果、以前治中國者、對於中央集權地方分權的制度、總是弄得糾紛不清、本黨總理所主張的、是不偏於中央集權和地方分權、而採均權我們便着手進行、九月十九日、日本暴行消息傳來以後、同人更覺有急謀團結對外之必要、我們組織國府的目的、是謀民主政治基礎之樹立、並不是對某人的問題、際此國難方殷、固非先謀内部統一不可、國家有了統一、然後對外交涉事項、才可以做、和平統一的意見、自九月以來、都是急迫進行、到十月間、蔡張陳三位先生到廣東之後、和平統一的進行、更形順利、前天同人等到滬昨天下午、見了蔣先生、又談了些關於種種制度上的辦法、民主政治的確立、蔣先生也當面表示同意、或庋有人以爲我們何不馬上到南京去呢、關於這一點、我想特别向各位說明一下、因爲黨政的分崩離析、非從根本上謀得一妥當的改善計畫、實不足以求永久的和平、我們的來意旣非祗想謀一時的團結、所以便要防止隨便的分崩離析、黨國的難關旣要求澈底打破、所以我們才來上海謀解决、我們的生命、不甚緊要、自由意志的尊重是重要的、如没有自由意志的尊重、那麽便何貴乎討論自由意志、比之命還重要過十倍百倍、我們到上海來、是來討論根本解决、過去各種糾紛的具體方法、我們希望的和平是眞的和平、求統一是求眞的統一、必如此然後黨國問題、才有眞正的解决、軍政財政種種難關、才可打破這些事體、斷非可以隨便了事的、須在一桌子大家平心靜氣的討論、根據事理來判斷、然後才不會再種將來惡因所以在上海的討論不是没有意義的、而且在上海多住幾天、更可以和上海各界多點機會接觸、有什麽消息、我們隨時可報告給各界、同時各界有什麽疑慮意見、也可以直接對各位解釋、今天得與各位見面、十分歡喜、關於其他問題、如最近外交和平和廣東兩次雙十節警察民衆衝突的事件其他種種、各位如有什麽問我們的、我們還有許多位同志、可以對各位解答的、</p>
<h3>孫哲先先生報告</h3>
<p>各位報界先生、剛才汪先生已經把最近情形報告清楚、兄弟稍爲再補充幾點意思這幾天來、廣東方面同志來上海、完全是來籌商一個具體的辦法、以備全力對外、我們如不求和平統一全力對外、我們是不來商議了、現在商議的是辦法的問題、和平統一的辦法須要澈底决定、才可保中國以後再不生糾紛、這次和平協商並不是什麽寗府粤府的事、也不是國民黨内的事、而是中國整個生死存亡問題所在、全國國民都應該研究討論、不能不負責任而置之不理的、當着這個國難日亟的時候、國民還不趁此起來團結力量、想個良好的方法、樹立民主勢力、恐怕這個目前困難、是應付不來的、中國幾年來、都是聚精會神在軍事上、多是用兵力來求統一、中國的兵額、可算是全世界最多的國家、差不多有一百幾十萬的兵、可是這一百幾十萬的兵有什麽用呢、日本來了一兩師團的兵、東三省已經給他整個的取去、我們中國軍隊、還要說早什麽無抵抗、日本侵略東三省之野心、許久以前就有了、早已成爲公開的秘密、我們要謀抵抗的方法、並不是從今日起、可是究竟到什麽時期、我們才有充分的力量、這實是個大問題、如今說到這個問題不能不承認事實、中國還未能成爲現代的國家、國家生存的條件、還未齊備、老的國家、已經崩潰下去、新的國家、還未組織起來、東三省問題、是幾十年來的大問題、中國一個都没有一點辦法解决、幾十年來都未有辦法、今天若仍没有辦法、那麽只好天天聽日本宰割罷了、一個國家、要對抗其他外力、必須國内的政治有軌道可行、同時還要充實國民經濟的能力、才有辦法來謀國家生存、可是國家建設、是急不容緩的工作、這個意見、不獨同人要負起責任、國民也應該共負艱辛的責任、今天招待各位各位、如果有意思發揮、我們必定就所知以至誠態度向各位解答、</p>
<h3>陳友仁先生答復</h3>
<p>兄弟本來不想說話、自到滬後、聽見許多傳說、迫得我不得不說幾句話、對外中國是統一的、東三省事件是很困難的事、扼要說來、就是外交方針、要以不損失中國絲毫利益爲主、我們曾要一個統一的政府、作統一外交的後盾、要一個統一的國家作統一的政府後盾、最近聽到有一些消息、說前次兄弟去日本、是出賣滿洲、兄弟覺得非常訝異、兄弟過去的歷史、諸位曉得的、將來的事實更可以證明兄弟前次到日本、不是去賣滿洲、實在是去救滿洲、（記者問）滿洲事件、國聯不能解决時、是採外交手段、抑用武力手段、（陳答）這句問話的本身、已經解答了、這個</p>

<p>問題、中國現在有没有武力、足以去打日本、這是不用說的、使中國人民明白此點事實、是中國負責的政治領袖應負的責任、那末不用外交的手段、用什麽、東三省事件、誠然是很困難的事件、但不是末有辦法解决的事件、過幾天、我將對這個問題發表一個主要聲明、我相信這個聲明、可以使全國國民滿意、（又一記者問）與俄國聨盟、對我國有利嗎、（陳答）没有、（問）爲什麽（陳答）不能詳細說、但要曉得、一個聯盟的成立、不在兩國政府間的關係、是在兩國人民的意志、中國人民、現在有要求和俄國聯盟的意志嗎、我看現在還没有、也許將來會有、不過這問者的意思、或許是指和俄國復交而言吧、（記者答）我是指與俄國合作對日而言、陳答、即便大不相同了、我們不單要和俄國合作對日、我們要和世界各國合作對日、</p>
<h3>記者問</h3>
<p>（一）蔣先生下野電何時發出、粤方是否堅持此項主張、財部宋子文之問題如何、將來和議成功後、是否政府組織、會重新改變、（二）對日外交方針如何、所取步驟怎樣、（三）對民衆運動、取怎樣態度、</p>
<p>汪精衞先生答當九月初時、蔣先生派人來粤接商、謂下野事可以辦到、後來我們提出辦法、在政治方面、先召集統一會議由統一會議産生統一政府、在黨務方面召集一二三屆委員、精誠團結、解决一切黨務問題、後來與蔡張陳三先生晤商結果、便由粤方草定蔣下野與粤府取消之電稿、後來蔣先生有所顧慮、不能立刻發表、而且文句又須斟酌修改、請我們到滬後、才可發表前天蔣先、行來滬時、已經預備發出、蔡先生等以爲一旦發出、恐人心浮動、照原電意思是新府成立後、蔣方解職、粤府方取消、不是馬上下野、馬上取消、在新府未成立前、舊有的仍然負責、至於到何時才發出、電文須再經一次商榷才能决定、至於宋子文的問題、那天確未說及、不過我們是主張財政要公開、全國人民、負了財政義務、而財政用途不知、是不妥當的、所以主張由政府和人民合組財政整理委員會、專整理中國的財政、關於民衆運動問題、記得今日報上、已登有孫哲生先生的意見現在似乎可以不說了、</p>
<h3>汪精衞談民衆團體列席和會</h3>
<p>將與寗方會商</p>
<p>遠東社、云關於民衆團體、能否列席和平會議、昨據汪精衞氏語遠東社記者、此次和平會議、最大目的、係要達到全國澈底和平、一致團結共同對外、至民衆團體代表列席和會一節、同人等頗表同情、俟與南京代表便商後、即行决定、如一界能參加、則各界均能參加云、</p>
<h3>汪精衞報告雙十節廣州警察民衆衝突事件經過</h3>
<p>方才有人問及雙十節廣州永漢路的事件、現在向各位約略報告、自從日本在東三省暴行消息到粤以後、廣東各界都是非常憤、慨紛紛組織抗日救國會、那時便有三個抗日救國會組織成立、一個是各界抗日救國大會、一個是全市學生抗日救國聯合會、一個是報界抗日救國聯合會、當時黨部方面、對民衆愛國運動、極力的扶助、可是同意義而有三個團體、却認爲不大妥當、因爲這樣子力量便不能集中、步驟也恐怕有差池、但是中央黨部不願採取强迫的方法、已在想方法去請他們合而爲一、丨這是雙十節前民衆方面的情形、至於事件之發生、最初是當晚雙十節六點鐘、有一個傷兵到永漢路一間新世界雜貨店裏買東西、大概是買一個暖水壺、傷兵看貨後、說這是日貨、伙伴說不是日貨、因此口角起來、傷兵便把暖水壺抛擲在地、他們衝突之後剛好有一隊日貨檢查隊經過、便入店把東西搜來焚燒、店伴便把電燈熄滅、鳴笛告警、警長馳至、責他們不應不合手續、便將商人貨物焚燒、應該報告抗日會和官廳才可以、糾察隊便圍着警長毆打、警長向天放了一聲空槍把他們警散、把傷兵帶返永漢分局問訊、民衆便紛紛報告抗日會那三個抗日會、都接得報告、以爲警察拘捕了許多人、羣衆圍困了警局、學生抗日會的代表陳則矯、馬華逸、便出頭向警局索取被捕學生、警局答覆未有拘捕學生、如果不信時、請派人入去看視、及後民衆愈聚愈多、學生抗日會陳馬二人入去警局查視、確見未有拘人、因爲這時聚集的人、已經有一千多、事情便發生出來了、在這裏兄弟分兩方面報告、（一）據學界抗日會和廣東機器工會方面的報告、丨說是後來羣衆愈聚愈多蜂擁門前、經學生代表當塲解釋、並未拘人後無效、那時永漢路剛剛修整馬路、石子很多、羣衆便拾起向警局抛擲、警局的門窗都破了、門前的望台和竹棚也摧破了、行將擁入局内、該分局局長杜煊泰打電話、給公安局長陳慶雲問辦法、陳答、永遠不許開槍、現在已請憲兵派隊到塲彈壓、不久可到、後來</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>憲兵來了二十多人、不夠力量彈壓、羣衆差不多就要破門入内、警局便放槍衝出、羣衆死者二人、（不是學生）傷者十三人、這是學生抗日會方面的報告、在來國府請願時、報告書是如此、在香港廣州各報也已經發表過、（二）警察方面的報告、上半叚是和學生抗日會報告相同、下半段有些出入、說是後來有三個雜在民衆中穿白衣黄襖的人、走到門前、抛了三個手溜彈入局内、有兩個不炸響、有一個響了、在局内草地上有炸彈的痕跡、說請政府可派人到局查核的、以上兩個不同的報告、最大注意點、一個說是用石抛擲、一個說除了石子之外、更有三個手溜彈、案件的癥結、便在這點上、如果眞個有手溜彈、警察爲自衞計、便不能說是警察錯、否則是警察的不對、後來警察也來請願說、這是合理的執行職務手續、執行職務、如果認爲有錯的、那麽我們警察可全體辭職了、所以當十一號那天、國府整天都應付這件困難的事件、本來廣東省會的發生事件、該由廣東省政府管理、可是因爲民衆到國府請願、國府不得不管、十一號那天、剛是香港當民衆到國府請願時、國府同人已决定辦法三點、（一）即行調查死傷人數、分别醫治撫卹、國府是對民衆同情的、（二）撤換公安局長、因爲處理不善、（三）永漢分局長杜煊泰即行扣留、組織特别法庭審訊、特别法庭的組織、由高等法院派員二人省府一人市府一人、軍法處二人、第一集團軍總司令部五人合組公開審訊、許民衆代表參加陪審、國府當日答覆之後、民衆大部份都滿意散去、還有</p>
<h3>招待記者攝影（本館攝）</h3>
<p>十分三民衆不肯散去、說非馬上槍斃杜煊泰不可、國府同人當答復、政府不能不經審判隨便殺人、即民衆亦不願政府隨便殺人的那天辦理這件案件、從早晨到晚間、同時、我們對民衆始終忍耐對他們主張馬上槍决杜煊泰的要求、認爲是激於永漢路事件之義憤、並不怪他們的、從早上七時起、民衆到國府請願、直至晚上七時才解决、民衆才陸續散去、國府下令憲兵司令部、把杜煊泰·開槍警察長員從公安局移押憲兵司令部、憲兵司令部接到國府命令時、已經晚上四五點鐘、派員去公安局押取杜煊泰時、怎知杜煊泰等四人和看守杜煊泰等四人、已串通逃走了、同人問聽消息之下、異常憤怒、杜煊泰有没有罪、法庭自有審訊、判决或未必會死自己逃走、顯然是畏罪潛逃、公安局的名譽不好、牽連國府的名譽也不好、當日是兄弟代表國府、向民衆說話的、尤其覺得無以對民衆、在次日國府會議、兄弟提請准予辭去國委職務、但各委員僉以兄弟對民衆說話、是國府同人推舉出來的、責任當不應由兄弟個人去負、而且國府處置此次事件之辦法、並未有故、即錯乃是公安局和憲兵司令部的疎忽後再下命查辦公安局長、查辦憲兵司令、嚴重懲戒令省府重賞通緝杜煊泰等、歸案究辦此外尙有一點報告的、就是當民衆到國府請願的下午起、事情便有些變化、民衆隊伍中、市面各地、竟發生有反動的傳單和標語有些並且書明是共産黨發的、更據軍警當局的消息、確有共産黨想乘機把事情擴大、放火擾亂、政府於是下了戒嚴令、來維持治安、我們來的時候、已經把戒嚴令取消了、此次事件發生在革命策源地面、當然是十分痛心、如果杜煊泰由特别法庭有了審訊結果、還可使民衆心裏較爲安慰、杜煊泰一逃、使案件延遲、責任雖係在憲兵司令部公安局的遲緩和疎忽、但是我們也覺得應該抱歉的、事後調查、死二人傷十三人、有誤傳死傷至幾十的實在是不確實、那天羣衆中份子極爲複雜、這些人身上有什麽東西、不可知的、至於徒手的學生、也有人受傷的、實在痛心關於三個手溜彈的事、當然是此案最要關鍵、究竟是否當日有手溜彈、法院正派人偵查研究、學生方面和警察方面的兩篇報告不同、研究之點、都在這上面、必要俟特别法庭詳細清查後、事實才可大白的、將來諸位總有機會知道的、</p>

<h3>和平聲中南華航路復通</h3>
<p>粤方禁航令撤消</p>
<p>中國船籌劃復班</p>
<p>本年四月分、廣東方面以軍事上關係、將汕頭廣州等海口封鎖、上海赴南華各輪、須用官廳所派領水船、故華商輪船、將南華航路、暫時停班、迄巳半年之久、近日和平統一、已將成功、南華航路、亦告解禁、本埠中國商船、已在籌備復業、茲將所聞、分記如下、</p>
<h3>撤除水雷</h3>
<p>在本年五月一日起、廣州當局、在汕頭港口、下水雷綫四道、曾通知各輪公司、凡到汕頭商船、在進口之際、須由粤方特派小火輪領導、方得駛進、今因和平開始、汕頭無防範之必要、粤當局已將所埋水雷撤除、凡上海開往之船、可不用引水船、得自由駛進該港口矣、</p>
<h3>解除禁令</h3>
<p>自五月十一日起、汕頭　　曾下停止夜航命令、進出口商船、須在指定時間内方許往來該埠、今夜航禁令、亦宣告廢止、恢復四月以前之原狀、而往來汕頭船舶、更無須檢騐矣、惟日本船自本月十五日起、已全不入口、</p>
<h3>華輪久停</h3>
<p>滬上南華班輪行駛汕　　頭廣東者、招商局派有廣大廣利源安泰順等四船、自五月内、因汕粤封鎖海口、而即停班、迄今達半年之久、未曾派船行駛其租輪源安、亦僅赴廈門香港、今廣利已調行福州、廣大又已拆去、源安泰順改走長江華北、南華航路、已久停不行、在抵制日輪以來、大好營業、爲英輪獨占、殊可惜也、</p>
<h3>籌備復業</h3>
<p>汕頭禁航令解除、廣東　　國輪可行、茲當出口貨擁擠之際、汕粤帮已紛電滬上各輪局、請速派國輪、恢復上海汕粤航路、供應國人需求招商局决計將久停之南華班輪復航、但一時無船抽調、已請總部先將源安輪放回上海、以資行駛汕粤、一面由局先添兩海輪、增航該路、船務科已在積極進行、不久便可開航、</p>
<h3>英輪貨擁</h3>
<p>今次抵制日貨國人澈　　底舉行、上海之南洋班日船、已完全無貨可裝、近兩個月中、太古怡和之汕厦港粤班輪、出口貨之多、實突破近數十年營業上之紀錄、每船出口水脚、貨客兩項平均總在三萬兩以上、邇日汕粤去貨、更爲擁擠、對尺碼重量、概須實足收費、故客家盼華輪復班尤切也、</p>
<h3>各大學抗日會電請保護東北避難同胞</h3>

<p>致粤黨部政府函　廣東省黨部曁省政府鈞鑒、暴日侵我國土殺我官民、凡屬國民、誰不髮指、際此國家危亡千鈞一髮之際、宜如何同心協力、抗日救國、以作政府之後盾、頃各方報告、汕頭多數奸商、竟敢破壞抗日工作、私進仇貨、拒絶檢查、應請嚴加懲辦、以肅法紀、平衆憤而儆效尤、則不特抗日工作之幸、亦黨國前途之幸也、臨電迫切、不勝悲憤、</p>
<p>致汕頭抗日會函　汕頭抗日救國會公鑒、頃據各方報告、謂貴地有多數奸商、竟敢破壞抗日工作、私進仇貨、等情聞之不勝悲憤、除已電請省黨部曁省政府嚴加懲辦外特電貴會、務希吾抗日各同志、秉先總理大無畏之精神撲滅一切反動份子、以達抗日救國之最後目的、吾上海學生、誓爲後盾、</p>

<h3>太平洋學會第三日</h3>
<p>圓桌上討論工業化</p>
<p>九國委員今日游杭</p>
<p>申時電訊社云、太平洋國際學會、昨開第三日大會、上午九時圓桌會議、繼續討論「中國之經濟發展問題」、仍分四組、第一組主席陶孟和、第二組主席内渡、第三組主席亨特第四組主席羅克培、十時三刻休息十一時一刻繼續會議各組聯席討論、主席胡適、並由劉景山演講「運輸問題」、何廉演講「工業化問題」、十二時一刻、議程委員與主席書記聯席開會、十二時三刻、華委員團公宴全體委員、下午二時、美委員團開會四時至六時、華委員團招待全體委員舉行茶舞會、晚間八時半至九時三刻、由羅克培氏演講「中國人口問題」、茲將討論演講及其他消息、探錄如下、</p>
<h3>工業化之討論</h3>
<p>中國經濟發展之討論昨爲第二日專論工業化問題、並特别注意於農村小規模之工業、中國農民半爲天時之關係、半爲藉種植而生活者、衆可利用剩餘之農工、從事農村工業以增收入、中國農民之歲</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>入、平均每年約二十元較以工廠工人、則每月可得約十五元此種工業已漸次發達、惟因缺乏信用放欵組織、專門技、術市場及其他各種工業所需之社會安寗、使交通便利及低率之捐稅、而受阻礙、</p>
<p>關於英國·愛爾蘭·瑞典·菲律濱·荷屬東印度·及日本農村工業之發展、由熟告断其情形之各委員報告、在菲律濱蔴織物及剌繡竹編工業等、已甚發展、在日本小規模之合作絲廠、於最近十年内、其成績遠勝於資本雄厚之同業、在中國各蘭草帽、花邊剌繡、等工業亦已露角、並有數處農民於暇時所生産之棉毛織品、價格低廉、堪與城市中之機械出品相競爭、</p>
<p>對於中國工業化之社會的預響討論頗詳、因在太平洋區内缺少鐵煤及煤油之供給、大工業之發展常爲其阻礙、其最足以進行發展者、只有手工藝、及可以利用現有或在國内自行生産之原料之其他工業、所有小工業、當先就現有者漸次擴充、並發展新工業之利用手工技術者、較投資於機器、爲益良多因手工藝之易覓市塲故也、此種工藝之開展藉鐵路之交通得獲市場者、爲功殊大、但只藉運輸一事殊欠不足、必須有良好之鄉村銀行、設立較好之生産及分配合作社、但此種鄉村工業之組織、有一事爲資本工廠組織所不及、蓋工廠組織能花樣翻新、左右市面、而無組織之鄉村手工業不能、惟手工業式樣、常一成不變、以致不合時宜、</p>
<p>農民間對於放欵及推銷之合作、在中國方始發軔、在日本則已大有進步、其中亦有可適用於中國情形者、當討論此種方法是否能增加生産時、有人提出疑問、謂値此生産過剩時期、增加生産、是否合宜、歐美各國雖已解决生産問題、然方困頓於分配問題之下、或謂中國所生産之之物、現尙不足以自給、故仍應注重於生産方面、亦有人謂世界各國、已在應付分配問題、中國亦應有所預備、而革新其土地租賃與耕種之方法、某代表謂中國之土地所有權、每三十年變遷一次、因國人習俗、婚喪嫁娶、所耗不資、農民鮮有儲蓄、則抵押借貸以應、加以重利之盤剥、遂永無續回之希望、故其主權常逐代轉移、此外尙有數代表、於討論耕種問題時、提議中國應否採取俄國之集合耕種法、並完全廢除農田私有制、因此點在中國難以實行、故祇能於以下兩項中採擇其一、即增進農民間之合作、接近保守的基爾特社會主義或繼續資本的經濟主義、而逐步改良、以革新中國農業現有之弊、</p>
<p>工業化於中國之利害如何、此問題亦經提出討論、某勞工代表謂歐美所受機器時代之影響使國内高薪給之人漸減、而失業之人、則日益增多、惟有人主張以爲即使我人一致承認工業化不利於中國、然此乃爲必不能免之事、其補救方法、惟有接受、而以建設方法指導之、使其於社會有利無害、並謀發展個人之小手工業、以與城市工廠競爭、或則生産品相同、而其價格較廉、或另行生産不適用機器之物品云、</p>
<h3>道路運輸問題</h3>
<p>劉景山君演講中國之道路運輸、其詞略述中國省道及國道之發展、省道已築成三萬五千英里、國道尙多在計畫中、在此三萬五千英里之省道内有一部份爲古之驛道、惟大半均係新築、祗有泥路、未舖路面、但有一小部份、尤茯是在城市附近者、均用石子舖面、國道則一律舖面、各路大多於兩年内以人工築成、機器之使用有限、在城市附近、每一新路開放、汽車人力車充滿於路、毫無組織、以致相率虧耗、實則各有適當之管理、無論運貨載客、均極有利、運貨車輛、當取其價廉而行駛較緩、可用於不良之道路者、如以福特森機車一輛、曳拖車數輛、每小時行十英里、其速率猶二三倍於馬車也、所有國道均係硬面、其建築費共三萬六千四百萬元、擬於今後十年内分别支出一萬七千萬元、因監工築路之工程師、不敷支配、故擬派青年工程師赴美學習、並聘請外國專家來華、在工科學校中設班敎授、此事由鐵道部主任、將以所征道路兩旁之地捐、及汽車捐、充作基金、並擬在汽車油·汽車·與汽車附件所征之關稅率、提出一部分、撥作此相</p>
<h3>中國之工業化</h3>
<p>何廉君演講中國工業化問題、略謂中國工業、殊不發達、其人口雖佔全世界四分之一、而産煤量僅佔世界總額百分之一·六、棉織業爲國内最發達之工業、然其錠子數僅佔全世界百分之二、此項工業、集中於六省、其面積佔全國百分之十、人口佔全國百分之三十、中國工業之發展、因缺乏資本與放欵之便利、而大受阻碍、華人紗廠、錠子數佔全國百分之三十七、所投資本、僅佔百分之二十八、日紗廠錠數佔百分之三十九資本則佔百分之七十、故華廠資本、平均每一錠子僅三十九、兩日廠則達一百三十七兩、因此中國各紗廠幾無流動资本而信用放欵之便利亦屬有限、且其利率極高、至於管理方面、亦存可以改良之處、其賑面上之利益、多不列入折舊一項、而營業發達之年、又往往將盈利全部派作股息、不知提存　、政局不定、與交通不便、亦爲附碍工業發達之原因、加以捐稅繁苛、在厘金未裁撤之前、運抵天津之羊毛、其沿途所納捐稅竟十倍於原値國内工業、仍頗氏廉、上海紡織工人、大人每日可得四角至一元四角、或平均每月十五六元、婦女兒童作工者亦不少、新工廠法現已頒布、然欲其施行有効、必先廢除包工制、並須有工人組織、以保護其自身之利益、但必須付給相當之代價耳、中國因缺乏大工業用之基本的原料、如煤）鐵·煤油·等致其發展大受限制、故應調查中國所生産及可以生産之原料、與依賴此項原料之工業、且有若干當施行保護關稅、家庭與手工業之發展、亦爲一大要素、但須有較好之放欵制度、與推銷上之便利云云、</p>

<h3>杭學生誤毁杜莊案</h3>
<p>賠償千元登報道歉</p>
<p>杜君諒解不欲追究</p>
<p>杭州西泠橋畔慈惠堂、爲滬紳士月笙新置之别墅、又稱杜莊杭人未悉底藴、誤傳爲王莊、上月二十九日、浙江省立高級中學抗日救國會學生參加抗日救國游行、因據報載有某部長在該處賞月、羣情憤激、立即列隊前往、將慈惠堂搗毁、室内器皿、全被損壞、事後經各方證明、始知慈惠堂並非王莊、某部長亦未曾在該處賞月、事出誤會、該校校長葉溯中、除向敎廳引咎自劾外、並來滬向杜君道歉、浙江省政府主席張難先·市長趙志游·公安局長何雲·及杭州市商會王齋竹·王薌泉·金潤泉·等亦均馳書杜君慰問、並致歉意、敎廳長張道藩、亦親自來滬、向杜君聲明誤會、並責令該校賠償損失銀一千元、又登滬報道歉、昨已一一履行、杜君以此次損失雖巨、惟以學生愛國行動、出於一時義憤、故已允不再深究矣、</p>

<p>Yoshizawa arrived 25 minutes late; Briand read out the draft resolution</p>
<p>Urging the Japanese government to immediately begin withdrawing troops</p>
<p>Advocating direct negotiations between China and Japan after the withdrawal of troops</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, the League of Nations Administrative Council held a public meeting. The meeting room was packed, and there was not a single empty seat in the audience. The atmosphere was particularly tense. After the members arrived, they sat around the circular table, but the Japanese chief delegate, Yoshizawa, was the only one who arrived late, making everyone wait for a full 25 minutes. Chairman Briand took his seat at 4 o'clock, and soon after, the Chinese chief delegate, Dr. Shi Zhaoji, also arrived. He appeared particularly resentful due to the great emotion he had experienced in recent days. As the Japanese representative was not yet seated, many people asked each other, "Where is Yoshizawa?" After 15 minutes had passed, the British chief delegate, Lord Cecil, became impatient and went to look for him. He returned to his seat a short time later. Soon after, Yoshizawa arrived and, after taking his seat, read a short statement in English, declaring that he still maintained his legal point of view regarding the attendance of representatives of non-member states, but that he was happy to welcome the American observer, Mr. Gilbert, as Japan especially wished to maintain friendly relations with the United States. Mr. Gilbert then replied to Yoshizawa's expression of sentiment in a humble manner, saying that he firmly believed that Japan's opposition to the presence of the American representative at the Administrative Council was purely a matter of legal principle, and that he believed that the long period of peace that existed between the United States and Japan was a happy chapter in their history. Briand then stood up and informed the entire council of the diplomatic documents sent to Tokyo and Nanjing since October 17. He then said that the Chinese government's reply to the Administrative Council stated China's trust in the League of Nations and its determination to handle the Manchurian issue peacefully, and its willingness to support a permanent organization that could make this policy effective in the Far East. Briand then summarized the main points of the entire case, saying that the Administrative Council had agreed on a resolution that would allow China and Japan to agree with the Administrative Council and end the prolonged discussions in the council. The Administrative Council had encountered extremely difficult problems this time and had tested its patience. Briand then recounted that Japan had assured the Administrative Council that it did not wish to undermine the integrity of Chinese territory and was prepared to withdraw its troops stationed in Manchuria into the railway zone when the safety of its residents in Manchuria could be ensured. China had also agreed to guarantee the safety of Japanese residents in Manchuria and to hand over the entire case to the Administrative Council without reservation. Therefore, the Administrative Council had a real need to find a solution to this difficult situation. The Administrative Council had finally unanimously (excluding China and Japan) agreed on a draft resolution, but it had not yet been accepted by the representatives of China and Japan. This was not a fixed and unchangeable plan, and it could still be amended. However, future discussions must be based on this plan. At this point, Briand read out the draft resolution as follows:</p>
<p>The Administrative Council, in accordance with the resolution passed on September 30 (the original text of which is as follows: (1) The Council takes note of the replies of the Chinese and Japanese Governments to the President's urgent request to the two countries, and of the steps already taken by them in accordance with that request; (2) The Council recognizes the importance of the Japanese Government's statement that Japan has no territorial designs in Manchuria; (3) The Council takes note of the Japanese representative's statement that the withdrawal of Japanese troops is underway and that the Japanese Government is willing to continue to withdraw troops to the railway zone as quickly as possible, in proportion to the tangible guarantees obtained for the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in Manchuria, and that the Japanese Government hopes to implement this intention as quickly as possible within the realm of possibility; (4) The Council takes note of the Chinese representative's statement that the Chinese Government is willing to assume responsibility for the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents outside the railway zone when the Japanese side withdraws troops and Chinese local officials and police forces are restored; (5) The Council is convinced that both the Chinese and Japanese Governments are eager to avoid any actions that could disrupt peace and good understanding between the two countries, and the Chinese and Japanese representatives have given their word, declaring that their governments are willing to take all necessary measures to prevent the expansion of the scope of the Manchurian issue or the aggravation of the situation; (6) The Council requests both parties to do their best to promote the restoration of ordinary relations between the two countries, and to continue and quickly complete the implementation of the above items in order to restore ordinary relations; (7) The Council requests both parties to provide the Council with complete information on all developments in the Manchurian situation at any time; (8) The Council decides that, unless an unexpected event occurs that requires the Council to convene immediately, it will meet in Geneva on Wednesday, October 14, to consider the situation existing at that time; (9) The Council authorizes the President, if the President, after consulting with his colleagues, especially the Chinese and Japanese representatives, believes that, based on the information he has received from the Chinese and Japanese representatives or other members of the Council regarding the development of the situation, there is no need to convene a meeting on October 14, to cancel the meeting on that day, and takes note of the fact that the Chinese Government has invoked Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant. The League of Nations Administrative Council agreed on a draft resolution on the Eastern Provinces incident. Cai Yuanpei and Zhang Ji went to Beijing yesterday morning to discuss the current situation and returned to Shanghai the same evening. Chairman Jiang hosted a banquet for the foreign envoys (see domestic important telegrams). An anti-British riot broke out on the British island of Cyprus (see foreign important telegrams). Wang Jingwei and others entertained the press (see local news).</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Other than Article 11, several other governments have also invoked Article 2 of the Paris Peace Pact. Therefore, it specifically reviews:</p>
<p>(1) The commitments made by the countries signing the resolution, especially the statement by the Japanese representative that the Japanese government is willing to continue to withdraw troops to the railway zone as quickly as possible, in proportion to the tangible guarantees obtained for the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in Manchuria, and the statement by the Chinese representative that the Chinese government is willing to assume responsibility for the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents outside the railway zone, and the pledges made with the intention of effectively protecting Japanese residents in Manchuria;</p>
<p>The Council also recalls (2) the assurances of both parties not to implement any plans that could aggravate the current situation, and therefore intends to implement plans to curb animosity without relying on any policy or action of aggression;</p>
<p>The Council also recalls (3) the Japanese representative's statement that Japan has no territorial designs in Manchuria, and takes note that this statement is in conformity with the articles of the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty, as the countries signing the two treaties have all pledged to respect China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity;</p>
<p>The Council (4) is deeply aware that in order to restore normal relations between China and Japan, it is necessary to fulfill these guarantees and commitments. Therefore, the Council hereby resolves:</p>
<p>(A) To urge the Japanese government to immediately begin and continuously withdraw troops to the railway zone, so that they can be completely withdrawn before the next meeting of the Administrative Council; (B) The Council requests the Chinese government to plan arrangements that can guarantee the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in the affected areas, in order to fulfill its promise to be responsible for protecting the safety of the lives of Japanese people in Manchuria, and requests the Chinese government to allow representatives of other countries to join the Chinese officials designated to handle this matter, so that the representatives of other countries can observe the implementation of these arrangements;</p>
<p>The Council (5) advocates that the Chinese and Japanese governments should immediately send representatives to coordinate the implementation details of the withdrawal of troops and the acceptance of the land from which troops have been withdrawn, so that it can proceed smoothly;</p>
<p>The Council (6) advocates that the Chinese and Japanese governments, after the completion of the withdrawal of troops, should immediately begin direct negotiations on the outstanding issues between the two parties, especially those arising from recent events, and on the existing difficulties, and on the issues arising from the Manchurian railway issue. For this purpose, the Council recommends that both parties establish a conciliation committee or a similar permanent body;</p>
<p>The Council (7) decides to adjourn until November 16, at which time it will re-examine the situation, but the Council authorizes the President to convene a meeting earlier if he deems it necessary to do so urgently.</p>
<p>The Chinese Chief Delegate, Shi Zhaoji, commented on this resolution, saying that it raised far-reaching and important issues. The resolution clearly stated that Japanese troops must be completely withdrawn by November 16. He had taken note of this. The resolution was very different from what China had requested, so he requested a slight delay so that he could have time to hear the views of his government. He also knew that the Administrative Council would adjourn for three weeks. He had only seen the original text of the resolution today, so he had no time to telegraph the Nanjing government before the meeting. The Japanese Chief Delegate, Yoshizawa, said that the Administrative Council could be assured of one thing, that Japan had no territorial ambitions in Manchuria, but that he could not set a definite date for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops outside the railway zone. Japan could only withdraw troops according to the progress of the protection of Japanese residents in Manchuria due to the disruption of the situation in Manchuria. Yoshizawa then stated the great interests of the Japanese army in Manchuria, detailing the current situation in Manchuria, the attacks on Japanese railway guards in Manchuria, and commenting on the anti-Japanese movement in China. Yoshizawa pointed out that the anti-Japanese movement was only adding fuel to the fire. Yoshizawa also expressed the hope that China could negotiate directly with Japan. Yoshizawa also said that many Japanese and Korean people had recently fled into the South Manchurian Railway area. There were no less than 1.2 million Japanese people in Manchuria. Yoshizawa then recounted the occupation of Shanghai by various countries in 1927, saying that the situation in Shanghai that year was incomparable to the current situation in Manchuria. Only the goodwill of the Chinese side could facilitate the withdrawal of Japanese troops. Finally, he stated that he reserved the right to express his opinion on the resolution after studying it. Shi Zhaoji thanked the President for granting his request for a temporary postponement of the expression of his opinion pending instructions from the government, and declared that he would contact the President after receiving instructions. Dr. Shi declared in an impassioned tone that the situation in Manchuria was the result of Japan's actions, and that he reserved the right to refute the remarks made by the Japanese Chief Delegate after studying them at a later date. Yoshizawa then stood up and said that he also reserved the right to examine Dr. Shi's refutation. The people in the meeting place responded with laughter when they heard Yoshizawa's reservation. President Briand proposed that the Administrative Council hold another public meeting at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow. The Chinese and Japanese representatives both agreed. By then, it was hoped that Dr. Shi would have received instructions from the Chinese government, and that Yoshizawa would also have received a portion of the instructions that had not yet been completed from Tokyo. The very important meeting of the Administrative Council then came to an end. The audience was packed, and they listened intently to the proceedings of the meeting, paying close attention. The members of the Administrative Council now believe that their efforts will be successful. The participation of the United States in the Administrative Council shows its determination to maintain world peace, which is the most encouraging sight. The British side believes that the Administrative Council can adjourn, although the Administrative Council will inevitably be criticized for not yet finding a solution, but it must be understood that the League of Nations' job is not to force an agreement, but to use public opinion to guide an agreement. It is now expected that the country that controls this point of contention can listen to the voice of reason, which cannot be regarded as unreasonable. Moreover, if an incident breaks out, the result will only increase the general economic and financial decline, and lead to a worldwide disaster. The British representative, Lord Cecil, made a statement to foreign journalists regarding the Manchurian situation, saying that he had great hope for the future in view of the work that had been done. The situation had changed since September. The imminent danger of war that was once imminent had now been averted. However, this situation was perhaps the most difficult situation that the League of Nations had ever faced. Therefore, the facts that the League of Nations had already done could not be ignored. The British side also said that the Administrative Council's proposal to resolve the Manchurian crisis could not be ignored. The representatives of various countries mentioned in the Administrative Council's resolution to monitor China's implementation of its arrangements to protect the safety of Japanese residents will be military and civilian officials of various countries in Manchuria, such as army attachés and consuls. According to reliable sources, after the meeting ended today, a special situation was discovered. China and Japan both failed to make concrete and detailed demands, and the Administrative Council had not heard anything about the so-called five basic points put forward by Japan as a prerequisite for direct negotiations with China. Because of this, the Administrative Council had to formulate practical proposals. Compared with the proposal of September 30, today's proposal is noteworthy in that it has been increased and decreased. Today's proposal mentions the Paris Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty, which strengthens the proposal and expands its basis. This was not the case in the previous proposal. The date for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops has now been specifically set for November 16, and it is advocated that direct negotiations should begin after the completion of the withdrawal of troops, rather than the two things being done at the same time. This is to satisfy China's demands. Today's proposal does not contain any suggestion for foreigners to monitor Japan's withdrawal of troops, but it asks China to allow foreign representatives to inspect the implementation of measures to ensure the safety of Japanese residents. Although the Chinese and Japanese governments will immediately negotiate directly on outstanding issues after the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, the proposal does not mention the recognition of rights under existing treaties. The so-called outstanding issues include recent cases and existing difficulties regarding the Manchurian Railway. As for the rumor from Tokyo that Japan is demanding compensation for the losses of various roads built with Japanese capital, the proposal has not mentioned it at all. Neither the Chinese nor Japanese representatives are prepared to criticize the original text of the proposal tonight. They will have to wait for instructions from their governments before they can express their opinions. (Reuters telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Administrative Council was originally scheduled to meet at 5:00 p.m. today, but it has been postponed to 6:15 p.m. because the Chinese representative, Shi Zhaoji, has not yet received instructions from his government. According to the Chinese delegation, government officials are currently meeting in Shanghai, and instructions from the government may not arrive tonight. (Reuters telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 2:30 p.m. on the 22nd, Briand handed over the draft resolution to Representative Shi in person. Then, at 4:30 p.m., when the Executive Yuan held a public meeting, Briand read out the draft resolution in public. The full text of the resolution was telegraphed by Representative Shi to Nanjing. It is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan, in accordance with its resolution of September 30, and knowing that in addition to China's invocation of Article 11 of the Covenant, the majority of governments have also invoked Article 2 of the Non-War Pact, (1) hereby reiterates the promises made by the various governments to the Executive Yuan in that resolution, especially the statement by the Japanese representative that the Japanese government will continue to withdraw troops to the railway zone as quickly as possible, in proportion to the degree to which the safety of the lives and property of Japanese people is effectively guaranteed, and the statement by the Chinese representative that the Chinese government will be responsible for protecting the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents outside the railway zone. This promise is sufficient to prove the effective protection of Japanese residents in Manchuria; (2) It reiterates that the two governments have guaranteed to avoid any actions that would make the existing state of affairs even more serious, so the two governments must not resort to any aggressive policies or actions, and must take measures to eliminate hostile movements; (3) Reiterates the Japanese statement that Japan has no territorial purpose in Manchuria, and notes that this statement is in accordance with the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty. The signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty have guaranteed to respect China's sovereignty and independence, and territorial and administrative integrity; (4) It is deeply believed that the practice of this guarantee and promise is necessary for the restoration of normal relations between the two parties, (A) requires the Japanese government to immediately begin and proceed sequentially to withdraw troops to the railway zone, so as to completely withdraw before the date of the next meeting under the regulations, (B) requires the Chinese government to fulfill its promise to protect the lives of all Japanese residents in Manchuria, and to adopt measures to ensure the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in the area when receiving the ground from which Japanese troops withdraw, and invites the Chinese officials appointed for this matter to be the same as the representatives of various countries, so that the representatives of each country may observe the implementation of this method (5) It is recommended that the Chinese and Japanese governments should immediately appoint representatives to agree on the details of the implementation of all matters concerning the withdrawal of troops and the reception of the withdrawn areas, so that they can proceed smoothly and without delay; (6) It is recommended that (1) after the withdrawal of troops is completed, the Chinese and Japanese governments should begin direct negotiations on the outstanding issues between the two parties, especially the issues arising from recent events, and on the current difficulties. These difficulties arise from the situation of the Manchurian Railway. For this purpose, the Executive Yuan proposes that both parties establish a mediation committee or a similar permanent body; (7) Resolution: The meeting is adjourned until November 16. At that time, the Executive Yuan will re-examine the situation. However, the Chairman of the Executive Yuan is authorized to convene a meeting earlier when he deems it necessary. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council's efforts to mediate the Manchurian case will reach its peak at 5:00 p.m. tonight, when it will hold a public meeting to vote on the mediation method it has proposed. However, the efforts of the League of Nations,</p>

<h3>Resolution of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>More than ten days have passed since the League of Nations Administrative Council reconvened on October 13. At the beginning of the reconvened meeting, the representatives of various countries seemed to be very excited, as if they were determined to remove the current predicament. After several days of meetings, the situation remained the same and there was no progress. Therefore, they unanimously led the United States, hoping for the formal attendance of the US representative to increase their support. However, since the formal attendance of the US representative until recently, in addition to the signatory countries of the Non-War Pact sending a memorandum to China and Japan based on the Non-War Pact, there is still no way to restrain the continued development of the Japanese violence or to resolve the serious situation in the Northeast. The situation is dire. The news of the past two days has been even more dismal, with a great tendency to be helpless and succumb to the power of the strong. However, today's news has come that the League of Nations has bravely gathered its courage again. At a public meeting of the Administrative Council, when the atmosphere of the entire meeting was extremely tense, Briand calmly took the stage and, after reporting the documents sent by China and Japan, also reported the resolution passed in the secret meeting. Its main points are: 1. Urge the Japanese government to immediately begin and continuously withdraw troops, and to complete the withdrawal before the next meeting on November 16. 2. Request the Chinese government to plan arrangements to ensure the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in the area, and to allow the League of Nations representatives to inspect. 3. China and Japan should immediately send representatives to coordinate the implementation details of the withdrawal of troops and the acceptance of the land from which troops have been withdrawn. 4. After the completion of the withdrawal of troops, China and Japan should immediately begin direct negotiations on the outstanding issues between the two parties, especially the difficult problems that have arisen after the recent events. It is recommended that both parties establish a conciliation committee or a similar permanent body. With this resolution, the depressed situation of the past few days has been initially developed. However, in this resolution, the League of Nations has failed to impose any responsibility on the violent Japan and has failed to fully satisfy the wishes of the people of the country. However, in order to respect the meaning of the League of Nations, we cannot predict whether it will accommodate the demands of the League of Nations. What we urgently want to know today is whether the League of Nations can use decisive means to deal with Japan according to its charter if Japan does not accept the resolution of the League of Nations and still insists on its basic points of view? Or will it hesitate and look back, and not immediately implement the resolution, but still delay it? This point is not only the key to the success or failure of the Sino-Japanese negotiations, but also the key to the survival of the credibility of the League of Nations. The danger of the breakdown of world peace has reached the final stage. Whether it can be saved is in this one move. The representatives of the League of Nations should quickly muster their courage and strive hard, and not be like before, advancing and retreating, and sitting and missing this urgent opportunity.</p>
<h3>Received Important Domestic Telegrams</h3>
<p>Has not yet succeeded. At the Council meeting yesterday afternoon, Briand announced that the mediation method proposed by the Council had been approved by the Council members, but had not yet been agreed to by the Chinese and Japanese governments. Therefore, the meeting decided to postpone the final meeting to 5:00 p.m. on Friday, and the Chinese and Japanese representatives also agreed to this postponement. Later in the night, Briand announced that the Council had accepted the request of the Chinese and Japanese representatives and postponed the discussion of the resolution on the mediation method proposed to the public general meeting on Friday afternoon. According to reports, the Council meeting was held at 4:20 p.m. yesterday, and the US representative, Gilbert, also attended. Half an hour before the meeting, Yoshizawa requested a postponement on the grounds that he had not yet fully explained the Tokyo instructions, but Secretary-General Drummond did not agree. Yoshizawa then arrived fifteen minutes late. After the meeting, Yoshizawa stated that he still reserved Japan's legal opposition to the attendance of the US representative and the invitation of non-member states to participate in the discussion. However, he welcomed US representative Gilbert, stating that Japan always had the determination to maintain peaceful relations with the United States. Gilbert replied that he fully valued Japan's opposition, knowing that it was purely legal and not political. He was very pleased to hear Yoshizawa declare the friendly relations between Japan and the United States, and the United States shared this sentiment. Chairman Briand then detailed the steps taken in accordance with the Non-War Pact, stating that each signatory country had sent the same note to the Chinese and Japanese governments. Thereupon, the Chinese Chief Representative Shi sent out the Chinese government's reply, stating that China fully trusted the efforts of the Council and hoped that the League of Nations would establish a permanent peace system in the Far East. Briand also stated that since the last Council meeting, he had often consulted with Dr. Shi and Yoshizawa, and both had expressed their greatest desire to seek a solution, so as not to further aggravate the situation. However, the current situation was unusual, and the roads were long and the transportation was inconvenient. However, in any case, a tool must be found, at least one that can be used to temporarily control the situation. Now that both sides can embrace the spirit of peaceful resolution, there is no way to avoid a good result. However, the most difficult thing at present is to find a way. He believed that the resolution proposed today, after final discussion and adoption, would achieve the desired purpose. The views of China and Japan remained the same as before, but the Council had been assured that there was no danger of war at present, which was the first thing they should pay attention to. Japan insisted that it had no intention of occupying Chinese territory and had the intention of withdrawing troops, and its desire remained to protect its nationals. China stated that it was prepared to study and provide guarantees to protect its nationals. Therefore, a way or a draft resolution must be found to stabilize the current situation and prevent it from changing. Japanese representative Yoshizawa gave a speech stating that the best thing China could do was to begin direct diplomatic negotiations with Japan, expressing its sincerity in resolving the Manchurian dispute. He also said that he could not set a time for the withdrawal of troops, so the Chinese representative Shi immediately asked the Council to give it time to study the Japanese speech and to request instructions from its government on the original text of the resolution, saying that it might not be able to get a reply from Nanjing by the time the meeting was held on Friday. As for Yoshizawa's speech, the main points were: He could not agree to setting a date for the withdrawal of troops, because the safety of Japanese nationals depended on the army, but the Japanese army was now withdrawing one after another, and the sooner or later of the withdrawal of troops at this time depended mostly on the attitude of the Chinese government and the Chinese people. He also detailed the current situation in Manchuria, stating that this was the reason why Japan could not set a time for the complete withdrawal of troops, but Japan still had the desire to withdraw its troops in the fastest and most possible way. Japan hoped to withdraw its troops in a way that could solve the problem once and for all. At present, only a small number of troops are stationed in China, but it hopes to get China's cooperation and goodwill, so that its time of stationing can be shortened to the shortest possible time. The Chinese Chief Representative Shi immediately informed the Council that, according to reports from the Beining Road personnel, after the Japanese troops withdrew from the Huangguantun station, they were still replaced by Japanese military police, and the Japanese troops at the Juliuhe station had not withdrawn a single person. Shi also stated that when requesting the Council meeting to be slightly delayed so that it could send the resolution proposed at the meeting to Nanjing for instructions, he stated that this resolution would produce powerful and far-reaching results. Although it was not the final resolution, it had set a time of three weeks as the period for Japan's complete withdrawal of troops. This was far from what China considered to be the need of the situation, but it was the result of the Council's month-long efforts to safeguard peace and obtain justice. Therefore, it should be given another day of discussion before it is put to a vote. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Special Foreign Affairs Committee Discusses League of Nations Proposal</h3>
<p>Drafted a reply telegram to Representative Shi</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The League of Nations mediated the Sino-Japanese dispute and reconvened for ten days, and finally decided on five measures after a secret meeting of the five major powers the day before yesterday, which have been seen in another telegram. Our country's representative Shi Zhaoji telegraphed the government for instructions. The Special Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting on the 23rd and submitted Representative Shi's telegram for discussion. After a long period of discussion by the members of the committee, it was generally believed that if the League of Nations considered it a fair solution, China would absolutely respect the judgment of public opinion based on the original purpose. Then, the detailed steps were discussed and signed one by one. A reply telegram to Representative Shi was drafted on the spot, and it was expected that this telegram would arrive in Geneva a few hours before the public general meeting. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japan Insists on Conditional Troop Withdrawal</h3>
<p>Repeatedly States Treaty Rights</p>
<p>Has Not Changed Original Attitude</p>
<p>(Geneva) People in the League of Nations were greatly relieved to hear that the Japanese government would conditionally accept the Council's resolution to withdraw all Japanese troops within three weeks, but they also acknowledged that the thorny problem facing the Council still exists. Because China insists that Japan's so-called treaty rights in Manchuria are invalid, it is expected that Chinese representative Dr. Shi Zhaoji will not be able to accept the resolution until he consults with his home government. However, it is feared that the Chinese government will most likely disagree. Although the League of Nations Charter authorizes the Council to consider treaties that are not in line with the current situation, this power has been under fierce attack since the League was established. Latin America has opposed reconsideration of the Tacna-Arica Treaty, and the major European powers are deeply afraid that the Treaty of Paris will be brought up for reconsideration and do not want to see this power implemented. Therefore, it is now believed that if China asks the League of Nations Council to express its opinion that Japan's treaty rights in Manchuria are invalid, the League will not necessarily be willing to make a statement. Even if some results can be obtained, it will take years and months to consider everything. Currently, Japan has expressed its conditional acceptance of the resolution proposed by the Council. It is expected that the resolution will be revised this afternoon to accommodate Japan's concessions. However, when the final vote is taken, it is expected that only a majority of votes will be obtained. China, based on Article 11 of the Charter, argues that unanimous agreement should be obtained in accordance with the Charter. If this resolution only obtains a majority agreement, it may only remain a resolution and may not be implemented. However, since it has the support of ten countries, it also has a kind of moral force. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government today instructed Yoshizawa to declare to the Administrative Council that if China agrees to acknowledge the binding force of its treaties and abolishes the anti-Japanese movement, Japan will also agree to begin withdrawing troops from Manchuria into the railway zone and will do its best to complete the troop withdrawal within three weeks. Although Japan still refuses to recognize the principle of withdrawing troops first and then opening negotiations, the instructions sent to Yoshizawa today are expected to reach Geneva in time and be submitted to the Administrative Council tomorrow afternoon. This move is seen as an important troop concession on the part of Japan, as Japan has so far refused to consider the issue of time limits. This concession is made with the clear statement to the League of Nations that it is of fundamental importance for Japan to have China acknowledge the binding force of its treaties. Here, this acknowledgement by China is seen as an essential element for a permanent solution to the entire Manchurian case. Although Japan is prepared to make conditional concessions on the issue of troop withdrawal, it must be clearly stated that when the Administrative Council reconvenes tomorrow, Japan cannot realistically promise to complete the troop withdrawal by November 16, as the progress of the troop withdrawal must depend on China's willingness and ability to guarantee the maintenance of security and order after the troop withdrawal. It must also be stated that the new instructions sent to Yoshizawa this time are not a new plan, but only a further concession to Drummond's first plan. (Reuters Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, the Japanese political circles were greatly shocked by the proposal submitted by the League of Nations Administrative Council, which was beyond their expectations. Officials said that it was difficult to understand the motives behind the Administrative Council's proposal. The Japanese government has accepted the suggestions of the President and Secretary-General of the Administrative Council and is preparing to revise a plan that can be accepted by the League of Nations. Therefore, Japanese officials are confident that once the revised plan is accepted, everything will proceed smoothly. League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond had prepared three different plans that the League of Nations could accept. The Japanese government has instructed Yoshizawa to declare that Japan is prepared to accept the first plan, with slight revisions, which is essentially the same as the one agreed upon by Briand and Yoshizawa based on five basic points. These instructions should be delivered to Yoshizawa by tomorrow morning. Therefore, the Japanese government believes that what the Administrative Council has proposed must be the first plan drafted by Drummond. Now, it is learned that the Administrative Council has not only decided to implement the procedures outlined in its third plan, ... but also that if China and Japan do not agree to other plans, the Administrative Council will draft a resolution and discuss the entire issue in a public meeting ... and that the resolution includes claims that Japan absolutely cannot agree to, which is a great disappointment. According to news reports from Geneva, public opinion within the League of Nations in favor of Japan withdrawing troops within a time limit is growing stronger. This morning, all the newspapers had commentaries opposing a time limit for troop withdrawal. (Reuters Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Seeing the stubborn attitude of the Japanese representatives, the League of Nations is making many speculations about the outcome of today's Administrative Council meeting. It is understood that a draft resolution submitted to the Administrative Council as the basis for resolving the Manchurian issue must be unanimously agreed upon to be valid. Therefore, if the Japanese representatives oppose it, this case will be stalled, and there will be no achievement other than reconvening the meeting on November 16 or earlier to reconsider it. Currently, important political figures from Nanjing and Guangzhou are meeting in Shanghai. It is expected that the Chinese government's reply to this case may not arrive in Geneva today. If so, the Administrative Council may not meet today. The Japanese delegation received news from Tokyo that Japan is willing to begin withdrawing troops if China acknowledges the binding force of the treaties, which is quite vague. It is understood that the Administrative Council's resolution does not mention the binding force of the treaties, and the phrase "acknowledging rights under existing treaties" is the fifth of the five basic points reported by Tokyo. However, according to the Japanese representatives here, this issue has never arisen in any stage of the negotiations in Geneva, because the Administrative Council has always maintained that the matters discussed in Geneva should be limited to troop withdrawal and the cessation of inflammatory movements, and that other disputes should be resolved by both sides at a later date. It is heard that Japan still has not changed its attitude. This morning, a Reuters reporter learned from the Japanese delegation that unless the Japanese government changes its attitude, Yoshizawa expects that the government may not have new instructions to arrive here. According to Yoshizawa's speculation, the Japanese government may not change its attitude. The instructions that Yoshizawa received instructed him to maintain his original attitude, so he had not heard of any so-called new instructions and could not determine what kind of outcome the Administrative Council meeting would have today. It is doubtful whether the Administrative Council can conclude today. If the meeting is held and cannot be concluded, the final act of the meeting will be held tomorrow. It is expected that the meeting will not be prolonged beyond this week. It is rumored that the Administrative Council may have to postpone the meeting, and Chairman Briand may not immediately put forward a resolution. The Chinese representative sent a telegram from Nanjing on the 22nd to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. The Japanese are now notifying Zhang Xueliang, informing him that 417 pieces of his furniture and personal belongings have been shipped from Dalian to Tanggu. The Japanese had previously notified Zhang Xueliang that the Japanese would not allow him to return to Shenyang, so they would send out his furniture and other items. The Nanjing telegram also stated that the Japanese had looted the residences of other officials and arsenals. (Reuters Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>The U.S. Adopts a Bystander Attitude</h3>
<p>Interpretations from Washington</p>
<p>Disappointment with the League of Nations on Many Fronts</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States has suddenly adopted an attitude of standing by and watching the Manchurian case. According to interpretations from here, this is natural, as the League of Nations is currently handling the issue based on its Charter, and the United States has no right to intervene. The indifference of the United States is not due to a lack of sympathy. The United States has fulfilled its duty by asking China and Japan to pay attention to their obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Now, unless the League of Nations asks the United States to cooperate in the peace preservation plan, the United States does not need to take a more resolute attitude. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) There has been another small change in the US government's view on the Manchurian case. Yesterday, it was believed that the League of Nations was making progress in mediation. Today, it is said that the US government has the impression that the situation in Manchuria is becoming increasingly complicated. The reports of Japanese troops bombing with airplanes in Manchuria and the difficulties encountered by the League of Nations have all made the State Department have the impression that the situation is serious. The State Department now seems to be waiting quietly for the League of Nations to take final and effective action before deciding whether the United States should change its original position. However, many parties are quite disappointed with the League of Nations, believing that even with the support of the United States, it has still not been able to negotiate a settlement. (National News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) China has formally thanked the United States for its kindness in issuing a note on October 20 asking China to pay attention to its obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Representative Sir John Simon Leaves Geneva for Home</h3>
<p>Mission to be Represented by Cecil</p>
<p>(Geneva) The extraordinary meeting of the Council of the League of Nations has begun this evening. British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon left Geneva for England this evening. Reporters spoke with Sir John before his departure. He did not want to make any responsible statements, but said that the situation in Manchuria did not seem to be making any real progress. After Sir John Simon leaves, his mission will be represented by Cecil. Cecil will represent Britain at the public meeting tomorrow, and after tomorrow's meeting, the Council will adjourn until November 16, when it will reconvene. Therefore, this session of the Council meeting can be said to have achieved nothing. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Comparison of Two Resolutions of the League of Nations Administrative Council</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The telegram from Geneva on the 23rd states that it is extremely interesting to compare the draft resolution on resolving the Northeast China issue, which was submitted to the general meeting of the Administrative Council on the 22nd, with the League of Nations resolution of September 30. The first case mentions the Nine-Power Treaty and the Non-War Pact, which were not included in the previous resolution, which is sufficient to increase the power of the resolution and place the resolution on a broader basis. Second, the draft of the 22nd determines the date for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, at the latest by November 16, which is much better than the vague wording of the previous resolution. Third, direct negotiations between China and Japan will take place after the withdrawal of Japanese troops, not simultaneously with the withdrawal of troops, which is one of the key points to satisfy the Chinese side's requirements. Fourth, although the Chinese side's request for the League of Nations to send personnel to monitor the Japanese withdrawal has not been affirmed, neutral countries can send personnel to China. The personnel sent can also observe the implementation of procedures such as taking over occupied areas and protecting Japanese expatriates. Fifth, the draft resolution does not mention the issue of assuming the rights stipulated in the existing treaties, but first asks China and Japan to resolve all outstanding issues, including all cases related to the South Manchuria Railways. Tonight, the Chinese and Japanese delegations are unwilling to express their opinions on this case, because they are waiting for instructions from their governments. Before the instructions arrive, they cannot comment. (Central News Agency, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Japanese Abandon Plan to Establish Central Manchuria Provincial Council</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese are actively inciting independence in various counties in Liaoning and carrying out so-called small autonomy movements. They recently planned to separate the six counties of Lishu, Changtu, Kaiyuan, Huai'de, Tongliao, and Liaoyuan to establish a so-called Central Manchuria Province. Recently, the Japanese felt that establishing a province was too ambitious and feared international opposition, so they abandoned the idea of a Central Manchuria Province. However, except for Tongliao County, which is located in western Liaoning and is difficult to control, they are instigating the remaining five counties to organize a Central Manchuria Joint Independent Autonomous Association to avoid the name of establishing a province while reaping its benefits. The association was established in Siping Street on the 15th, with Ma Longtan as its president. (Special Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Shantou Municipal Government Refutes Japanese Consul's Protest</h3>
<p>(Shantou) Chen Fang provided food to the Fengshan Maru, which was seized by the investigation team and paraded through the streets. The Japanese Consul sent a letter to the Municipal Government protesting that the anti-Japanese news published in various newspapers was mostly inconsistent with the facts. He also stated that the investigation team intimidated the ship's messengers and inspected documents. If the Municipal Government cannot implement strict measures to guarantee the personal freedom of the workers, he will order the landing of the Hai Zhi. If any misunderstandings occur, the Municipal Government will be responsible. The Municipal Government has sternly refuted the protest. (Special Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Shantou) Mayor Huang Zixin visited the Japanese Consul due to widespread rumors about Japanese people smuggling weapons into the city and discussed the implementation of inspections of Japanese residents. The Japanese Consul politely declined, saying that since China and Japan were not at war, there was no need for such measures. He said that he still found it difficult to communicate with the expatriates, so how could there be riots? In addition, Japanese merchants in Shantou were facing boycotts and had no business, and many had returned to their country, with more than half having already left. All the merchants had closed their doors. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Still Active</h3>
<p>People in the League of Nations Deeply Surprised</p>
<p>(Geneva) Tonight, all circles in the League of Nations were greatly shocked to receive news that Japanese troops in Manchuria had clashed with Chinese troops again. Just as the Council implicitly recognized that the League of Nations could not make progress in mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute until at least a month ago, and therefore wanted to extend the meeting to November 16, the sudden arrival of this news has made the Council even more distraught. Japanese military aircraft have reappeared in the skies over Manchuria after the Japanese government guaranteed to withdraw them to Korea. People in the League of Nations are particularly surprised by this, saying that the League of Nations' current actions depend largely on whether China and Japan are provoked into war.

<h3>Japanese Set Up New Unloading Platform at Julu River</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Will Soon Leave for Shanhaiguan</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army has set up a new unloading platform at the Julu River. A large number of military equipment and supplies will be transported there soon. A team of new soldiers landing in Dalian will leave for Shanhaiguan to guard it. People's hearts are extremely uneasy. (Special Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a telegram from Beiping, Japanese aircraft flew over Shuangyangdian, east of Jinzhou and the Ling River, yesterday and today to conduct reconnaissance for more than two hours before leaving. On the 22nd, the Japanese army transported more than a dozen heavy artillery pieces from Shenyang to the Julu River. The Japanese army is building military camps and storage depots in Xinmin, Julu River, and other places, setting up fortifications and defenses, and conducting daily outdoor exercises in full formation. Not only is there no intention to withdraw, but there are also preparations for war. Nearby residents are often accidentally injured by stray bullets during the exercises.

<h3>Panic Among Chinese in Dalian</h3>
<p>Japanese and Korean Ruffians Run Amok</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Dalian said that there were rumors in Dalian that Japanese and Korean ruffians were attacking and plundering Chinese people. Therefore, the Chinese residents of Dalian</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>were extremely panicked and were leaving for the mainland one after another. However, Chinese people account for 80-90% of the population of Dalian. If all the Chinese people were to leave, Dalian would immediately become a deserted city. Therefore, the Japanese sealed off Dalian. The Japanese police station notified the Chinese people that those who wanted to leave Dalian must obtain a permit, otherwise they would not be allowed to leave the port. When applying for a permit, they must inquire in detail. Those with a little wealth and intelligence were generally rejected. Therefore, there were very few Chinese people on the ships coming to Qingdao, and there were also no goods. In reality, they were restricted by the Japanese and lost their freedom. In Dalian, the monitoring of our compatriots is extremely strict. Bank deposits can only be used to withdraw living expenses and must be withdrawn by the Japanese on their behalf. The Japanese have already treated them as people of a conquered nation. (Special Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Falsely Accuse Our Army of Shooting Again on the Tao'an Road</h3>
<p>(Beiping) On the 21st, several Japanese aircraft dropped six bombs at Daxing Station on the Tao'an Road. Afterwards, the Japanese fabricated facts, as they did with the bombing of Jinzhou, and routinely falsely accused our army of firing first. It is heard that Japanese Consul Shimizu in Hei has protested to Chairman Ma. In reality, the Japanese secretly assisted Zhang Haipeng's plan to attack Hei, which was thwarted, and they had no choice but to find another way to make things difficult for the Hei Provincial authorities.

Because Vice-Zhang has indicated this time that he will be responsible to the end, it has not been heard that he intends to issue a telegram of resignation. It has been learned that the recent central government circular prohibits officials from speaking arbitrarily. Wei may not have seen this order. (Special Dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Foreign Important Telegrams</h3>
<h3>Anti-British Riots Erupt on British Island in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd: A violent riot erupted in Nicosia, the capital of British Cyprus (an island in the Mediterranean). Government offices were burned. The cause was the Greek Nationalist Party's attempt to annex the island to Greece. According to a report in a French newspaper from Athens, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop announced three days ago that the island would be annexed to Greece because the majority of residents were willing to do so. The only opponents were a small number of Turkish people. It was also reported that members of the Cyprus Parliament had submitted their resignations. Two British cruisers and two destroyers have been ordered to sail from Crete to Cyprus. In addition, a British army regiment from Cairo is heading to the island. Reuters, Nicosia, 23rd: Cyprus has a population of 350,000, including 70,000 followers of the Greek Orthodox Church. Only 50,000 residents participated in the anti-British demonstrations. Many of the demonstrators served as Greek volunteers in the Balkan Wars of 1913. According to newspaper reports, one person was shot and killed and eleven others were injured after the government offices were burned.</p>
<h3>U.S. and French Authorities Begin Negotiations</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd: French Prime Minister Laval discussed the world financial recovery with President Hoover at the White House today. Laval told members of the press that all issues related to the U.S. and France would be discussed freely. He also said that he hoped that his visit to the U.S. would dispel rumors aimed at alienating the two countries.</p>
<h3>British Currency Autonomy Theory Revived</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st: The British currency autonomy theory has been revived by Sir Basil Blackett. Blackett was formerly the financial commissioner of the Indian Legislative Council and is now a director of the Bank of England. He gave a speech at the London Rotary Club today. Blackett expressed deep doubts about Britain's ability to restore the gold standard, believing that the gold standard could not work until the international situation had calmed down. However, if Britain could sacrifice exchange rate stability and focus on its own economy, then it would be worthwhile to consider the autonomy of the pound. If the pound could be successfully established as the currency of the British Empire, it would soon attract other countries outside the Empire to follow suit, and a truly international currency could be rebuilt to fulfill its dual purpose of stabilizing foreign exchange and prices. (Note: Before Britain restored the gold standard in 1925, there were two factions advocating for and against restoration. The most prominent argument against restoring the gold standard was Keynes' currency autonomy theory (Keynes Managed Currency). The purpose of currency is to stabilize exchange rates and prices, with price stability being the most important. Since the gold standard cannot stabilize prices, the method of currency autonomy should be adopted to stabilize prices and abandon the gold standard, leaving exchange rates to their natural course. Although it was defeated by the restoration of the gold standard in fact, its theoretical value is still there. In addition, Darling advocated for an imperial currency with the "Roikas" as the unit, which was well-founded but rejected in practice. The Imperial Conference failed to adopt it. We believe that the concentration of gold in North America after the war is the reason why Britain advocated for autonomy. Recently, the distribution of gold has become uneven, with France accumulating gold particularly prominently. However, under the current situation of declining world prices, the gold standard is not sufficient to stabilize prices, and its weaknesses are becoming more apparent. The abolition and restoration of the gold standard is largely a factual issue. However, as the two countries accumulate more and more gold, the British advocacy of currency autonomy will inevitably prevail, which is inevitable.)</p>
<h3>Soviet Foreign Minister Cancels Visit to Turkey</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Ankara, 22nd: Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov had planned to visit Turkey and had scheduled to depart at the end of this month. However, due to some important matter that prevents him from leaving Russia, the previous plan has been canceled. Turkish Prime Minister Ismet has decided to travel to Moscow soon. Although the reason why Litvinov cannot leave Russia has not been clearly announced, it is probably due to the urgent situation in the Far East.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Finance and Public Opinion in Shenyang Under the Iron Heel of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Official Banks Under Military Control</p>
<p>Chinese Newspapers Become Mouthpieces of Japan</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Shenyang Northeast Official Bank and the Frontier Trade Bank have resumed business on the 15th of this month under the pressure of the Japanese army. According to a source from Shenyang, Commander-in-Chief Honjo Shigeru of the Kwantung Army issued Instruction No. 25 to Yuan Jinkai, Chairman of the Local Maintenance Association, on the 11th of this month, notifying the Japanese army's measures for the bank's operation. The instruction was based on the Japanese Army Regulations, which directly placed the bank under its military control. The full text is recorded below. How should the Chinese people feel when they read it? "Regarding the opening of the Northeast Official Bank and the Frontier Trade Bank, attention should be paid to the following items. On this occasion, I hope that the Local Maintenance Committee will work with me to quickly restore the finances of the former provincial government in order to restore public order and life and to implement local maintenance effectively. (1) The Japanese army, in accordance with Article 43 of the Army Regulations, recognizes the opening of the Northeast Official Bank in order to restore and ensure public order and life and to facilitate general finance. (2) When the Northeast Official Bank carries out its business, it shall, in accordance with Article 53 of the Army Regulations, ensure the interests of the Japanese army. In addition, in accordance with Article 43, it shall do everything possible to restore and ensure public order and life. (3) In order to achieve the aforementioned goals, the Japanese army must send several supervisors to oversee the bank. The above supervisors must be recruited by the Northeast Official Bank from the Japanese side and appointed as advisors or consultants. Not only those recruited, but also officials from the Japanese army may be sent to supervise the business of the Northeast Official Bank from time to time. (4) The Japanese army may, whenever it deems necessary, suspend all or part of the business of the Northeast Official Bank. (5) If the Local Maintenance Committee wishes to create a list of candidates for the business execution of the Northeast Official Bank, it must be approved by the Japanese army. (6) The Northeast Official Bank must absolutely not engage in any hostile acts or hostile transactions against the Japanese army, nor may it engage in transactions with those who engage in such acts. (7) Regarding the business execution of the Northeast Official Bank, if the Local Maintenance Committee or the business execution 담당자 gives instructions, it must be approved by the Japanese army in advance. (8) The Northeast Official Bank must not allow excessive funds to be stored in its branches in various places. (9) The above regulations for the Northeast Official Bank shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Frontier Trade Bank.</p>
<p>Chinese-run newspapers in Shenyang, such as the Northeast People's Daily, the Xinmin Evening News, the Northeast Public News, the Xing Shi Bao, the Xin Ya Daily, the Northeast People's News, the Xin Chen News, and the Swastika News, were previously independent of each other. Since Zhao Yushi initiated the organization of the Liaoning Press Association and the association sponsored the Liaoning United News Agency, the newspapers have had considerable contact. After September 18, all Chinese newspapers in Shenyang temporarily suspended publication. People in the Northeast were eager to read newspapers due to the tense situation. The Shengjing Times, the mouthpiece of Japanese imperialism, became popular as a speculative business, with each copy retailing for as much as one dime. After Doihara became mayor, he realized that the Northeast People's Daily and the Xinmin Evening News had great influence among the people and tried to restore them. He sent personnel to find ways to publish them, while on one hand, he drew images to capture Zhao Yushi, the president of the newspaper, and on the other hand, he sent Japanese ruffians to forcibly occupy the newspaper office as the new site of the Fengtian Public News. Zhao disguised himself and came to Beiping on the 23rd of last month, escaping capture. The Northeast Public News, the Xing Shi Bao, the Northeast Daily, and the Swastika News, seeing the forced occupation of the Fengtian Public News, feared that the general riffraff would follow suit, and automatically resumed publication, hoping that decades of history would not be interrupted. The Northeast Public News published a notice stating that all communications were cut off and that it could only record news from the Japanese side. The other newspapers did not make such a statement. Currently, the important news on the second page of the Public News is taken from newspapers sent to Shenyang from Beiping and Tianjin. The news supplied by the Japanese is appended to the end, which has aroused the hatred of the Japanese. The Liaoning News Agency and the Manchuria News Agency, organized by Japanese civilians, are spreading rumors as much as possible. The Chinese newspapers have no choice but to use them to fill their pages due to lack of news. It is said that the Liaoning News Agency has ordered 50 copies of each local Chinese newspaper as a basis for future negotiations. As a result of Zhao Xinbo's contact with Shih Fei Yuan recently, the Northeast People's Daily was instructed to have the Fengtian Public News vacate the address. The Japanese ruffians moved to the Xin Chen News in Maluwan, emptying the People's Daily's casting machine and newly cast lead type during the relocation. After Zhao's negotiation, part of it was returned, and the People's Daily was returned to Zhao for management. It is actually a mouthpiece of the Japanese. Editor-in-chief Zhang Mengjiu must have a community commentary every day, crowning the first article, fully expressing his pro-Japanese and traitorous ideas. News headlines also take this as their purpose. Compared with the original content of the People's Daily, it is no different from a catastrophe, and it is even worse than the ridiculous Fengtian Public News. Now I heard that there is a saying that a certain Japanese person is taking over the People's Daily and the Xinmin Evening News. The Evening News will also be restored within days. However, Zhao Xinbo has just received 4,000 yuan in start-up funds from the Local Maintenance Association, and he is using the People's Daily as a machine to curry favor with the Japanese. Whether he can hand it over is still a question.</p>

<h3>Chinese People in Dalian Have Lost Their Freedom</h3>
<p>Must Obtain Permits to Leave the Country</p>
<p>Bank Deposits Not Allowed to Be Withdrawn</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: According to sources from Dalian, Dalian has been greatly affected by the East Province Incident. The market has suddenly declined, and there have been rumors that Japanese and Korean ruffians will attack and plunder Chinese people. Therefore, the Chinese people living in Dalian feel extremely uneasy and are returning to the interior. However, the Chinese people account for 80-90% of the population of Dalian. If all the Chinese people leave, Dalian will become a deserted city. The Japanese are currently blockading Dalian, which is also one of the reasons. Since the 18th of this month, the Japanese police station has notified the Chinese people that if they want to leave Dalian, they must obtain a permit, otherwise they will not be allowed to leave the port. Furthermore, when applying for the permit, they must inquire in detail. Those with some wealth and knowledge are generally rejected. Therefore, there are very few passengers on the ships coming to Qingdao today, and goods have also disappeared. In fact, many Chinese people intend to leave Dalian, but they cannot do so freely due to the restrictions of the Japanese. In addition, the Japanese are more closely monitoring our country's dignitaries and wealthy merchants living in Dalian. They are not allowed to withdraw any of their deposits in Japanese banks. Even the living expenses needed for daily life must be withdrawn from the bank by the Japanese on their behalf. The amount is only sufficient to cover expenses and must not be exceeded. In essence, the Japanese are treating them as slaves of a conquered country. (October 20)</p>

<h3>Kan Chao-xi's Telegraphic Statement</h3>
<p>Canceling the Provisional Maintenance Association of the Four Classes</p>
<p>Disengaging from the Local Maintenance Committee</p>
<p>Kan Chao-xi's telegraph states: "To all newspaper offices, for the information of compatriots nationwide: Since the sudden calamity of the Japanese army occupying the Northeast, officials and wealthy gentlemen fled together. Thousands of miles of mountains and rivers were almost without leadership, and the general populace, having lost their guiding force, were neither able to resist nor to evade, thus falling into an environment of chaos and panic. Their appeals had no reliance, and their livelihoods were cut off. In this precarious moment of survival, they had no choice but to rise up themselves and seek ways to protect themselves and provide relief. Therefore, at that time, more than thirty mass organizations jointly formed the Provisional Maintenance Association of the Four Classes. I, in my capacity as a commoner, was a member of the association. Unexpectedly, the election results placed the heavy responsibility of chairman on my shoulders. Seeing the disorder and the urgency of the disaster victims, and eager to provide relief, I did not have time to consider everything else and readily agreed. So, I raised funds and established hospitals and rescue teams, carried and buried the dead, and accommodated and treated the injured and sick. Furthermore, recognizing the hunger and cold of the poor, I established porridge kitchens everywhere to provide food and clothing. For refugees from other places, I found ways to send them back to their hometowns. After doing this for some time, I actually achieved some small results and received considerable praise from the citizens. However, from the very beginning of its establishment, this association was determined to be of a temporary nature. Recently, various agencies have been established one after another, and someone is responsible. Therefore, after public discussion, it was decided to announce the cancellation of the Provisional Maintenance Association of the Four Classes on October 10th. The unfinished matters were completely transferred to the Local Maintenance Committee for takeover. This difficult situation can be considered to have come to a temporary end. I, Chao-xi, believe that I am no less patriotic than others. This time, as a commoner, I did not avoid danger and came forward to take on this matter. I did not initially consider the merits or demerits, but only felt that being in this situation, my conscience would not allow me to do otherwise. Therefore, I risked my life and sacrificed everything. At this time, when the whole country is united in indignation against foreign aggression, and is also collectively angry at the maintenance associations at the most intense moment, I dare not ask for the understanding of the people of the country, let alone claim credit. But in this situation, doing a little charitable and rescue work, I ask myself that I have no shame towards my compatriots externally and can greatly comfort my conscience internally. If, in the work of this association, there is a discovery of facts that betray national sovereignty and dignity and disregard integrity, I will resolutely bear full responsibility. However, people from all walks of life are in the association, and the composition is complex. It is inevitable that there will be one or two individuals who do not listen to the public. Therefore, those who slander this association belong to personal conduct, and it cannot have any relation to the entity of the association. As for the establishment of the Local Maintenance Committee, my name was also included. At that time, I was in the process of handling the affairs of the Four Classes Association, and the affairs were busy, so it was difficult to take care of other things. I repeatedly resigned to the association, but was not permitted. But in fact, I did not participate in the opinions, so I cannot take any responsibility. Now that social order is gradually recovering, the military and national plans are naturally taken care of by the authorities. My initial intention of rescue and care has been fulfilled. I wish to return to the people from now on and return to my original status. I hereby declare that I am also completely disengaged from the Local Maintenance Committee. For the past month, I have been exhausted physically and mentally. As the saying goes, 'Offering the gall to others is disliked for its bitterness, but setting the heart free restores peace to the body.' But in this critical autumn of survival, how can I seek ease and survival? If there is a way to save the country and benefit the people, I, as a commoner, have a responsibility, even if I go through fire and water. I respectfully reveal my heart and present it to the people of the country. May my sincerity be understood and appreciated. Kan Chao-xi, seal (Secretary Ding Zhonglun issued on his behalf)."</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhijiang's Letter to Dr. Eddy</h3>
<p>Please widely publicize the true situation in Liaoning and Shenyang</p>
<p>To prevent Europeans and Americans from being deceived by Japan</p>
<p>World-renowned speaker Dr. Eddy's visit to China coincided with the time when the Japanese violently occupied our Liaoning and cruelly murdered our compatriots. Dr. Eddy spoke out generously, giving speeches everywhere to speak up for our country, and telegraphed his government to report on the Japanese occupation of the Eastern Provinces, requesting that justice be upheld. Yesterday, Zhang Zhijiang, the Pacification Commissioner of Jiangsu, sent a letter to Dr. Eddy to express his gratitude and hoped that he would continue to spread the truth with his unyielding spirit, so as to prevent Europeans and Americans from being deceived by Japan's fraudulent propaganda. The original letter from Zhang is recorded below: "To Dr. Eddy, a great scholar: In the past year in Beijing, I had the honor of hearing your famous speech, and your brilliance was admired from afar. I have been deeply moved. Recently, I read in the newspapers your testimony about the Japanese military's atrocities in Shenyang, and your speeches in Shanxi about the Japanese military's barbarity. As an outsider recounting what you have personally witnessed, you have spread the truth about Liaoning and Shenyang throughout the world. Not only has our nation benefited from this, but it is also a blessing for world peace. After hearing this, my admiration and respect are indescribable. Our people love peace. In the past, Japan repeatedly exerted pressure on us, but when Tokyo was hit by an earthquake, our country followed the ancient teachings of disaster relief and neighborly assistance, repaying evil with good, and did not hesitate to help. This year, our country suffered from floods that far exceeded the Tokyo earthquake. If Japan had even a little bit of humanity, how could they bear to take advantage of our crisis, daring to act improperly, robbing and plundering wildly? Their intention seems to be that in this world, there is only power and they do not know that justice is difficult to erase. Your righteous words are a testament to the fact that justice has not been erased. However, Japan's diplomatic methods are extremely cunning, and Europeans and Americans are easily deceived by their fraudulent propaganda. If you could find a way to quickly spread the truth of your views, then world sympathy will surely be awakened by you. I have attached a letter from me to the Chinese Church, and I hope you will consider it."</p>
<h3>Joint Defense Measures for Various Counties in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Considering that local security needs special attention after this year's floods, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs is organizing winter defense early for the sake of the people. It has formulated joint defense measures for various counties, which have been submitted to the provincial government for the record. At the same time, telegrams have been sent to various counties, ordering them to comply. It is reported that the entire province is divided into sixteen joint defense zones, with the county magistrate of the locality as the director of the joint defense zone. The first zone includes Jiangning, Zhenjiang, and Jurong, meeting in Jiangning. The second zone includes Lishui and Gaochun, meeting in Lishui. The third zone includes Liyang, Jintan, Yixing, and Danyang, meeting in Liyang. The fourth zone includes Wuxi, Wujin, Jiangyin, and Changshu, meeting in Wuxi. The fifth zone includes Wuxian, Kunshan, Qingpu, and Wujiang, meeting in Wuxian. The sixth zone includes Jiading, Taicang, Baoshan, and Chongming, meeting in Jiading. The seventh zone includes Songjiang, Jinshan, and Shanghai, meeting in Songjiang. The eighth zone includes Nanhui, Fengxian, and Chuansha, meeting in Nanhui. The ninth zone includes Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong, meeting in Nantong. The tenth zone includes Taixing, Taixian, Rugao, and Jingjiang, meeting in Taixing. The eleventh zone includes Yancheng, Funing, and Huai'an, meeting in Yancheng. The twelfth zone includes Baoying, Gaoyou, Dongtai, and Xinghua, meeting in Baoying. The thirteenth zone includes Jiangdu, Yizheng, and Yangzhou, meeting in Jiangdu. The fourteenth zone includes Liuhe and Jiangpu, meeting in Liuhe. The fifteenth zone includes Siyang, Suqian, Suining, Shuyang, Huaiyin, and Lianshui, meeting in Siyang. The sixteenth zone includes Tongshan, Pixian, Fengxian, Peixian, Xiaoxian, and Dangshan, meeting in Tongshan. As for the military strength of each joint defense zone, it is drawn from each county, and the allocation is as follows: (1) At least two-tenths of the county police force should be drawn as guerrillas, directly under the unified command and dispatch of the director of the joint defense zone, along with the guerrilla forces of each county in the zone. (2) The special police force of the public security bureaus of each county should draw a number of personnel when necessary, to be under the command and dispatch of the director of the joint defense zone. (3) At least four-tenths of the defense corps of each county must be designated as guerrillas, organizing joint defense in neighboring townships. When necessary, they must also be directly under the command and dispatch of the director of the joint defense zone.</p>
<h3>Xi Qia Recruits Scattered Soldiers from the Countryside</h3>
<p>Jilin dispatch: The 25th Independent Brigade of the Army, stationed in Dongdaying in the provincial capital, was ordered by Xi Qia to go to the countryside when the Japanese army arrived in Jilin. Later, due to lack of military pay, it dispersed. Now, in order to appease and recruit them, Xi Qia issued a proclamation stating that the situation has stabilized and that the straggler soldiers should be recruited. Zhang Zuozhou, the former commander of the 25th Brigade, has been dismissed for many days, and no one is in charge. Now, the brigade is reorganized into the 1st Garrison Brigade, and its three regiments are reorganized into the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Garrison Regiments. Liu Baolin is the commander of the 1st Regiment, Ren Yushan is the commander of the 2nd Regiment, and Zhao Weibin is the commander of the 3rd Regiment, responsible for handling the recruitment matters. All straggler soldiers, whether armed or not, should return to their respective units as soon as possible and must not be scattered outside. Those who do not comply will be treated as bandits. Everyone must abide by this. Furthermore, Tong Rongpu, the captain of the army reception team (former commander of the engineer battalion), who specializes in receiving unarmed soldiers, also announced a few days ago that all officers and soldiers who had surrendered their weapons and were scattered in the suburbs of the provincial capital were experiencing difficulties in food and clothing in this cold weather. The reception center is well prepared. All unarmed officers and soldiers should report to the old engineer battalion in Jiangnan within one week from the date of the announcement. Once the reception is completed, they can be reorganized into teams. Do not wait and see, etc. However, most officers and soldiers are now unwilling to accept Xi Qia's orders, and it is still questionable whether they will return. Even if they do, it will only be one or two out of ten.</p>
<p>The provincial capital's gendarmerie and public security bureau actually issued a notice yesterday strictly prohibiting insults to Japan, roughly stating that since the Japanese army was stationed in Jilin, the security has been very good, and the relationship between the general merchants and the Japanese army is also very harmonious. However, they are still concerned that a few merchants may not understand the truth and may engage in actions that insult the Japanese military and civilians, which would be detrimental to the relationship. Merchants should understand this and be aware of the overall situation, and be content with their livelihoods. They must not engage in the above-mentioned actions. Anyone who disobeys in secret will be severely punished. The wording is absurd to the extreme. They truly deserve to be the lackeys of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>According to recent claims by the Japanese side, the Japanese troops coming to Jilin will withdraw some of their troops at the end of the month, and the rest will be stationed in the artillery camp in Lianhua Pao in the east of the city. The Chinese side will be responsible for maintaining security. Xi Qia then ordered the Public Security Bureau to recruit 500 long-term police officers. On the other hand, with the consent of the Japanese military authorities, he also formed a guard team of 530 people, with one company each of engineers and laborers, in preparation for taking over the defense in the future (October 17th).</p>
<p>Local Communications</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Reactionary criminal Zhang Xingsong sentenced: Zhang Xingsong, a communist from Fengjing, was an accomplice of Wang Ziqin and others who had already been executed. After Wang Ziqin was arrested, Zhang fled to other places. He was arrested by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters last spring and sent to the High Court for review. According to the Law on Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China, the case was sent back to the county to organize a temporary court for joint trial. County Magistrate Shen served as the presiding judge. The High Court also designated Deng Peiyi, a judge from the Shanghai Court, and Li Wenwei, a judge from the Songjiang Court, as joint trial officials. They interrogated Zhang Xingsong at the county government on the 12th of this month. According to Zhang Xingsong's confession, he was 57 years old and worked as a geomancer. He was originally a member of the Kuomintang. In 1928, he was introduced by Wang Ziqin to join the Communist Party and served as a branch secretary, etc. After the debate concluded, he was sentenced to three years and four months of imprisonment. Two other counter-revolutionary criminals, Wu Qinghe and Cao Shuming, are scheduled for joint trial on November 3rd.</p>
<p>Minutes of the County Government's County Administration Meeting: The county government held a county administration meeting yesterday, presided over by County Magistrate Shen, to discuss the following matters: (1) County Magistrate's submission: According to the Construction Department's instructions, which were forwarded from the Provincial Government's instructions, Wu Boyang submitted a report stating that the civilian land used for dismantling the city wall and building roads last year should be replaced with public land in equal amounts to comply with the established plan. It was decided to instruct to prepare a plan for submission and approval. It was decided that the location of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Monument has not yet been approved. The Construction Department should be asked whether it is determined to be in the center of the West Gate Moon City so that the base used by Wu Boyang can be measured and a distribution plan can be discussed. The rest is omitted.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Merchants found to be holding Japanese goods petition: The Anti-Japanese Association of Wuxian County has been extremely vigilant in its work of inspecting Japanese goods recently. In recent days, it has seized five or six hundred pieces of Japanese goods, mostly paper goods, about two hundred pieces. The goods are currently sealed up at the station and the county party headquarters. The Paper Industry Association therefore convened a meeting of its members yesterday (23rd) and went to the Chamber of Commerce in the afternoon to petition. They nominated representatives Wu Xianglin, Yao Yuchang, and Gui Lanfang to contact Shi Jun, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, stating that the paper goods were not Japanese goods and that they included 50 pieces of domestic goods from Lisheng Factory's gray newspaper paper. They requested that the Anti-Japanese Association be transferred to quickly identify and return the goods. If the resolution is delayed, there will be no goods on the market, and business will be suspended, etc. Chairman Shi agreed to negotiate with the Anti-Japanese Association, and the county party headquarters also paid attention to this matter, sending Liu Youmei from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association to Suzhou for identification. Liu was also unable to identify the goods, so he took samples of the goods to Shanghai for research.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Director of Public Security Branch Bureau accused of dereliction of duty: Dai Yuheng, the director of the fourth branch bureau of public security in this county, has been derelict in his duties and has committed many bad deeds since taking office. He has been accused of four counts by the third district office, requesting the county government to investigate and deal with them: (1) Abusing his power to extort money, (2) Abandoning his post and neglecting police affairs, (3) Abusing his authority and extorting wantonly, (4) Privately collecting illegal commissions and embezzling fines. The evidence is conclusive. It is reported that County Magistrate Pang was extremely angry after receiving the report. If it is true, he will severely punish him according to the law.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Department of Finance Strictly Pursues Autumn Business Tax: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance believes that the business tax of each county, as usual, should be collected before the tenth day of the first month of the next quarter. Now that the autumn collection period has passed, it is urgent to start collecting and it is difficult to delay any longer. Yesterday, it specifically sent a telegram to the business tax bureaus and finance bureaus of each county, ordering them to quickly send personnel to the urban and rural areas to collect taxes from each household, and to collect all the autumn taxes in the urban areas before the 20th of this month, and all the autumn taxes in the townships before the 30th of this month. All the money should be handed over to the Jiangsu Bank and the library receipts should be presented for verification. If there is any delay, only the bureau director will be held responsible. If any merchants violate the regulations and request reductions or exemptions, the bureau should immediately reject them and not forward them on their behalf to avoid delaying the time, etc. Wang Shutang, the director of the Wuxi Business Tax Bureau, immediately transferred the letter to the Chamber of Commerce for discussion at this year's representative assembly.</p>
<p>Series of Robberies Occur in Xushe Town: More than a dozen robbers suddenly came to Yang Yuequan's house in Yangxiangshang, Xushe Town, District 14 of the county. They all spoke in a strong northern accent. They broke into the room and looted for an hour before carrying away their loot. On the way, they passed through Songxiangshang, a neighboring village, and robbed Song Qingchu's house. Because the victim refused to open the door, they tied him up and forced him to reveal the location of the hidden silver. They searched the address and robbed for half an hour before carrying away their loot and fleeing towards Wuli Lake. The losses of the two families totaled about 2,000 yuan. The case has been reported to the county for arrest.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Tries to Avoid Conflicts with the Business Community: The County Party Headquarters received a telegram from the Provincial Executive Committee, stating that the Anti-Japanese Association and the Chamber of Commerce should try their best to avoid conflicts. It immediately divided and instructed the County Chamber of Commerce and the Anti-Japanese Association to restrain both sides and absolutely avoid conflicts. Also, the silk cloth, northern goods, and other sixteen industries petitioned the County Party Headquarters the other day, requesting that the Japanese goods stored in the shops that had not been registered be re-registered and that ways be found to provide relief to avoid affecting finance. The Standing Committee of the County Party Headquarters has decided to handle the matter according to the principles stipulated in the Provincial Measures for Eliminating Enemy Goods, with the following two measures: (1) Japanese goods that have not been fully registered before are allowed to pay a national salvation donation and be re-registered. (2) After re-registration, if private storage of Japanese goods occurs again, severe penalties will be imposed. The original resolution was submitted to the Provincial Party Headquarters for the record. Yesterday, it was transferred to the Chamber of Commerce to convene a meeting of various industries to comply.</p>
<p>Taifu Silk Factory Closes Down: Taifu Silk Factory, located at Tatang Bridge outside the South Gate, has been in operation for more than ten years and has had annual surpluses. It has now expanded to 380 silk machines, and the land and buildings are all self-purchased. In the past two years, due to the disastrous decline in the silk market, it has suffered huge losses. Recently, although it received silk industry bonds, it was a drop in the bucket and did not help. It had no choice but to announce its closure. Yesterday, manager Wang Songlu convened a shareholders' meeting and decided to implement liquidation. It is reported that the losses, including deposits, totaled more than 400,000 taels, with the Jiangsu Bank being the most affected. The financial community has been affected greatly, which has a significant impact on the market.</p>
<p>District Chief Accused: The Case Takes an Unexpected Turn: Ni Jianye, the district chief of the second district of the county, was accused by Mao Jinshan, a villager from Tao Dian Township in the district, of defrauding Wu Sibao, Deng Abao, Ni Agen, and others of 240 yuan. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Chen ordered Qian Zhongliang, the district chief of the first district, to investigate and report. After receiving the order, District Chief Qian commissioned Zhang Qian, a staff member of his district, to go to Jiangxi Bridge and other places, as well as the Second District Office, to investigate. Because the accusation also involved Wang Weixin, the director of the Third Public Security Branch Bureau outside the South Gate, on the evening of the 22nd, he went to the Third Branch Bureau to meet with Wang Weixin. It is unknown how a solicitation of bribes occurred. The two sides twisted each other to the County Public Security Bureau. After Bureau Chief Hua opened the court for interrogation, he ordered both parties to return to their posts and await investigation. Because both parties were willing to stay at the bureau, they waited until dawn at the supervisory office. After learning about this yesterday morning, Qian Zhongliang, the district chief of the first district, separately visited County Magistrate Chen and Public Security Bureau Chief Hua. As a result, both parties were ordered to return to their posts and temporarily handled by the administrative department. After County Magistrate Chen investigates, he will review and handle the matter.</p>
<p>Nanyang Company Stores Enemy Goods: The Inspection Department of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the County discovered a large batch of enemy goods privately stored by Feng Taiyuan in the small Lianzhu cigarette boxes of the Nanyang Tobacco Company's warehouse. The matter has been submitted to the meeting and a decision has been made on how to deal with it. Yesterday, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Branch of the Cigarette Dealers' Industry in the county stated that Jin Shisun, the director of the Nanyang Company's warehouse, colluded with unscrupulous merchants and privately stored enemy goods. This was heartless and unpatriotic. They specifically submitted a report to the County Party Headquarters and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of All Circles, requesting a severe punishment to punish the unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>Gaochun Representatives Come to Wuxi to Beg for Relief: Gaochun County Magistrate Wang Guanxian stated that the disaster situation in the county this year is extremely serious. More than 280,000 mu of polder fields have been submerged, and the number of deaths has reached more than 10,000. Currently, there is more than two feet of water in the polder, and there are more than 160,000 disaster victims. Therefore, the Disaster Relief Association decided at a meeting to appoint Wang Guodong, Tong Mingxin, and Yuan Huiyu as representatives to go to Suzhou, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and other places to beg for relief. Yesterday (23rd), Wang and others carried the official letter from the county government and took a boat to Wuxi to visit County Magistrate Chen, requesting assistance in raising funds to save the disaster victims.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>More Arrests in the Destruction of the Party Headquarters: A part of the merchants in Wu County destroyed the county party headquarters and other agencies. The county government had previously arrested Ye Jinde, the manager of Dalun Silk and Satin Shop, and others, and transferred them to the county court for interrogation. On the 22nd, two more people, Li Ziying, the owner of Dajixiang Shop, and Huang Jinrong, the clerk of Henghetai Shop, were arrested. After being transferred to the county by the Public Security Bureau, they were also transferred to the county court for investigation. As for the party headquarters, Standing Committee Member Gao Baizhen and Executive Committee Member Li Miaoshi went to the province yesterday to petition, requesting severe punishment for the destruction case in order to thoroughly resolve it. Since the occurrence of this case, the officials have been investigating everywhere, and the merchants of the shops involved have fled one after another and taken a car to Shanghai to take refuge temporarily.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Department of Construction Will Abolish Affiliated Agencies: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction intends to abolish the four affiliated agencies, namely the Water Conservancy Bureau, the Highway Bureau, the Electricity Management Office, and the Provincial Capital Construction Engineering Office, in order to implement a tight fiscal policy. All the work undertaken by the agencies will be merged into two sections to handle. It is reported that the Department of Construction originally had four sections, but now it has been reorganized into six sections. The chief officials of each agency are: the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau is Shen Baixian, who is also the director of the department; the director of the Highway Bureau is Chen Hefu, who is also the secretary; the director of the Electricity Management Office is Jin Pu, who is also the technician; and the director of the Provincial Capital Construction Engineering Office is Xu Tigang, who is also the secretary. All of them will either remain in their original positions or concurrently serve as the section chiefs. This reform has been detailed in the detailed rules for handling affairs of the Department of Construction, which was passed at the 444th provincial meeting, and is scheduled to be implemented on the first of next month.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Reorganization of the County Defense Corps: The defense corps of each district in Nantong County were temporarily organized by recruiting men due to the banditry in the past. It has now been decided at the county administrative meeting to dismiss the recruited men by a certain date and organize them by the method of conscription to save expenses. The provincial government has ordered the continued accommodation of the Jiangbei disaster victims. The provincial government has ordered the county government to continue to try to accommodate the disaster victims from Funing and other counties in Jiangbei as much as possible. County Magistrate Zhang stated that the expenses of the accommodation center were huge and the local financial resources were limited. He specifically telegraphed the province to request a subsidy. If the provincial funds were not available, he requested to choose another location for the unarrived disaster victims and to send back the disaster victims who were being accommodated.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Details of the Arrest of the Anhui Opera Bandit Monk: Yesterday, the Anhui Opera bandit Monk Daogen was arrested in Gaomiao Town, which borders Jiangsu and Anhui counties. On the 14th of this month, Biantang Town in Huxi County was looted by Anhui bandits, and 143 hostages were taken. Because there were very few wealthy people among the hostages, the bandits ordered someone to send a message to Biantang Town, promising the people of the town to prepare funds to redeem the hostages. When this message was conveyed to the town, the families of those kidnapped held a meeting to discuss the method of raising funds, but there was no one to contact the bandits. As a result, someone found out that the abbot monk Daogen of Guandi Temple in Xuyi Shuai Bridge was acquainted with the bandits who looted Biantang Town. Daogen was currently in Gaomiao Town, which borders Jiangsu and Anhui. Upon learning of this news, the families selected four representatives to meet Daogen and asked him to contact the bandits. Daogen initially declined, but then agreed to their request. The next day (16th) early, Daogen went alone to intercede with the bandits and returned at noon. He told the four representatives that the bandits had only taken 86 hostages and demanded a total of 10,000 yuan. Upon hearing this, the four representatives asked him to go and negotiate a price reduction. As a result, they agreed on 5,000 yuan, with the condition that they bring the money to redeem the hostages within three days. Each family returned to the town to raise funds and asked Daogen to wait here. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 18th, Daogen was suddenly arrested by Captain Li of Tongcheng. After a detailed investigation, the inside story was revealed. Daogen was ostensibly the abbot of Guandi Temple in Xuyi County, but he was actually one of the Anhui opera bandits. Because the temple property was originally very rich, with 18,000 mu of grain fields, since Daogen took over as abbot, in addition to spending lavishly, the remaining funds were used to purchase various types of quick-firing guns. Over the years, he had accumulated more than 600 guns. Because he was in contact with large groups of local bandits in Anhui, Daogen was honored as the leader of the bandits over time. At that time, the people of the villages and towns of the county only knew that he was communicating with the bandits, but they did not know that he was also a bandit himself. He would send temple disciples out to commit crimes. This time, when the Anhui bandits looted Biantang, all counties in Tianjin secretly ordered the garrisons in various towns to secretly arrest Daogen. Just as Daogen was staying privately in Daomiao Town to contact the kidnapping of a large number of people in Biantang, Li, the captain of the police team stationed in Tongcheng, Tianchang County, detected it and suddenly arrested him. He was then escorted to Tianchang County for detention. It is said that if Daogen had stayed in the temple, it would not have been easy to arrest him.</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>The Supreme Court Organizes Volunteer Army: At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, party members and probationary party members in the Supreme Court gathered to discuss the organization of the National Salvation Volunteer Army by the party members of the court.

Once the charter is drafted, the organization and training will be carried out immediately.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>A Close Call at the Cinema: The Xin Guang Cinema, organized by Liu Yao from Anhui and others, has been operating for nearly two decades since its opening. Unexpectedly, yesterday, during a screening, the chimney became blocked with coal, causing a sudden fire. The fire spread to the thatched hut used as a machine room. Fortunately, the Yi Long community members rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and worked hard to extinguish the fire. Afterward, the Public Security Bureau dispatched police to the scene to investigate. Due to the small size of the cinema's location and inadequate equipment, the cinema was ordered to temporarily cease operations.</p>
<p>Handling of Seized Contraband: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this county has successively seized unregistered Japanese goods from Yuan Feng Sheng Silk Shop, Heng Yu Zeng, Yong Feng Heng, etc. Therefore, at yesterday's seventh executive committee meeting, it was resolved to confiscate the seized Japanese goods and impose separate penalties.</p>
<p>Capture of Bandit Yu Shun-sheng: Yu Shun-sheng, a chief under the notorious bandit Tai Bao A-shu in the eastern part of this county, had committed numerous crimes in major towns. Since the capture of the bandit leader, Yu had been on the run. The bandit suppression headquarters had issued a reward for his arrest. Recently, Yu, under the alias Yu De-hua, had deceptively joined the Seventh Public Security Bureau in the neighboring Jinshan County as a patrolman. A few days ago, while in Lüxiang, he was recognized by a local resident, who secretly reported to the local defense corps, who then cooperated with the public security sub-bureau to arrest Yu. After being identified by victims, he was escorted to Jinshan on the 20th to be brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>South Society Statement: No Telegram to Retain the County Magistrate: County Magistrate Du of Xiaoshan has been dismissed by order. Various circles have sent telegrams requesting his retention, as a formality. However, the County Chamber of Commerce has refrained from such insincere gestures regarding County Magistrate Du. Instead, it published a statement in the Hangzhou newspaper clarifying that it did not send any telegrams requesting his retention, demonstrating the greater knowledge of merchants in recent years. Moreover, the appointment and dismissal of county magistrates are at the discretion of higher authorities. Such insincere behavior should be eliminated under the current Party rule.</p>

<h3>Measures for Implementing First Aid Training for Female Students in Secondary Schools and Above in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Reduce Existing Courses to Implement First Aid Training</p>
<p>Hangzhou students are implementing economic severance with Japan and actively implementing military training. However, the specific measures for first aid training for female students have not yet been determined.</p>
<p>In view of this, the Hangzhou Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has drafted measures for the implementation of first aid training for female students in secondary schools and above in Hangzhou. The measures were passed by the Standing Committee and sent to various school anti-Japanese national salvation associations to guide all female students in implementing the training. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All female students in secondary schools and above in Hangzhou, except those who voluntarily join military training, must implement first aid training in accordance with the provisions of these measures. (2) The duration of first aid training for female students is tentatively set at 80 to 100 hours. The teaching schedule will be determined by each school based on its own situation, but the number of training hours per week must not be less than four hours. When necessary, training may be intensified to achieve rapid application. (3) When each school implements first aid training for female students, its existing courses may be reduced as appropriate, but each teacher must be responsible for guiding students to make up for the lost material through self-study outside of class. The first aid courses may also be taught during holidays by taking out a few hours. (4) The first aid training curriculum and teaching materials for female students will be drafted by the Hangzhou Medical Association under the entrustment of the Hangzhou Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association, and will be distributed to various schools for application by the Education Department. (5) The number of students per class and the allocation of classrooms during training will be determined by the Hangzhou Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association, entrusted to the Education Department, after investigating the actual situation of each school, but the number of students per class must not exceed 100 at most.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>The Voice of Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>Recently, the calls for Chiang Kai-shek's resignation have been clamorous. As a citizen of the Republic of China, I naturally have a voice. I want to express my personal opinion. I believe that at this time when foreign enemies are encroaching and the country is in danger, Mr. Chiang should not only not resign, but should also "take the stage." What does it mean to "take the stage"? It means going to the battlefield, leading the patriotic soldiers and civilians of the entire China, and fighting a bloody path to the death with the tyrannical and unreasonable Japanese.</p>
<p>Talks About Not Removing the Weeds in the Courtyard</p>
<h3>The Voice of Farmers</h3>
<p>Four years ago, listening to Zhong Xiang sing the Baoding Farmer's Song, the tone was tragic and inspiring, but unfortunately the original lyrics could not convey the spirit of the song. I had long wanted to rewrite the lyrics to express the injustice for modern farmers. Last year, a friend of mine returned from an inspection tour of the Central Plains and Northwest, and told me in detail about the lives of farmers in that area. According to this friend, self-cultivating farmers in Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu and other provinces do not want to own land. Why? Because in the face of natural disasters and man-made calamities, it is not easy to cultivate land, and they still have to pay taxes. Not only can they not pay less than a penny of tax, but they also have to pay the tax for the year of Mao in the year of Yin, no, the tax for the year of Wu in the year of Yin. In some places, no one wants the land deeds even if they are given away; if no one wants them, they have to borrow at high interest and sell their children to pay the taxes. Although they own land, they still cultivate for richer landlords. What is the reason for this? Because cultivating for others, they can still earn wages to feed themselves every day. If they cultivate for themselves, they must wait until the autumn harvest to have rice to eat, and they will have already turned into bones. Therefore, they have no choice but to get rid of their own land and cultivate other people's land. What kind of phenomenon is this! After listening to these words, I wrote a short portrait for our unfortunate compatriots based on the tune of the Baoding Farmer's Song:</p>
<p>"Wearing tattered cloth clothes;</p>
<p>Eating grass root noodles;</p>
<p>Carrying the unsold child on their back,</p>
<p>Starving and crying for their father.</p>
<p>Leading the old ox,</p>
<p>To cultivate other people's fields.</p>
<p>The sun shines on their bare heads,</p>
<p>Their hearts are like boiling oil.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of the harvest,</p>
<p>Borrowing money at high interest to pay taxes.</p>
<p>Good people become bandits,</p>
<p>Where can they seek justice?</p>
<p>Locusts with human faces fill the sky,</p>
<p>Fill the sky!</p>
<p>Without farmers, who can live between heaven and earth!"</p>
<h3>A Mirror for Those Who Collude with the Enemy</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>Ever since the violent Japanese suddenly invaded our Eastern Provinces, all Chinese people have embraced the determination to fight the enemy with the same hatred and unite. Indeed, the tragedy of national subjugation and the humiliation of slavery are imminent. Yet, some still want to seek temporary peace and hope for good fortune from others who might pity us. Even the most foolish and bloodless people in the world would know that this is impossible. However, there are people like Xi Qia who are willing to collude with the Japanese army and plan to form an illegal government in Jilin, even appointing officials. Zhang Haipeng, as a general in our country, is actually serving the enemy and willing to be their lackey. These two are not only scum of our country, but also recognize thieves as their fathers, and their crimes are unforgivable. I recall that twenty years ago, there were two people who willingly betrayed the country, one was "Zhao Yuqing" and the other was "Jiao Dian." The reasons for their colluding with the enemy were different, but their imprisonment and punishment were all the same. Therefore, I retell their stories as a warning to those who still have pro-Japanese factions.</p>
<p>Zhao Yuqing acted as a Russian military spy, using heavy funds to purchase confidential military documents from the army and navy and pass them to Russia. Later, the matter was exposed. The government was shocked and furious. After a military trial, he was punished according to the army regulations and sentenced to life imprisonment in a prison. Newspapers recorded the incident, and all crowned him with the title of traitor, to punish him. This happened in May of the second year of Xuantong in the late Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>Jiao Dian stole and sold military maps of the three provinces to the Japanese. The cause of this case was instigated by his concubine. The concubine was a Japanese woman whom Jiao married when he studied in Japan. She had already given birth to a son. When the case was exposed, she took the money and fled with her son. However, she was eventually arrested and executed. Jiao was originally a staff member of the Ministry in Beijing. He was unable to take office due to lack of funds. Therefore, he took this reckless action. However, he lost his life for a few thousand taels of silver. Commentators hated his person but pitied his foolishness. At that time, the bonds of the Daosheng Bank were filled in the pockets of nobles and officials, by the dou and by the cart. The secrets of the cabinet were taken by foreigners as easily as taking things out of a pocket. Compared to Jiao Dian, their crime was small. This happened in the third year of Xuantong in the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that in the late Qing Dynasty, the discipline had fallen and the righteousness had been extinguished. Yet, those who punished those who were disloyal to the country and flattered the enemy were still able to enforce the law impartially, so that those who followed would be warned. Alas, can the crimes of Xi Qia and Zhang Haipeng today be pardoned? When I read history to the fourth year of Zhongping in the Han Dynasty, the Jin Cheng bandits surrounded Fu Xie in Hanyang. Several thousand Northern Hu cavalry followed to attack the county. They all cherished Xie's kindness. They all kowtowed outside the city, asking to send Xie back to his hometown. Xie's youngest son, Gan, said, "The country is in chaos, which makes it impossible for adults to be tolerated in the court. Now the world has rebelled, and the soldiers are not enough to defend their hometown. The Qiang Hu have been favored first, and they want to abandon the county and return. I hope you will allow it. Go slowly to your hometown, lead the righteous people, and assist those who have the right way to save the world." Before Xuan finished speaking, Xie sighed and said, "Bie Cheng, do you know that I am going to die? I will cover the sacred and oppose the festival, and then keep the festival in the world. In times of chaos, I cannot nurture the spirit of awe. I eat the salary and want to avoid the difficulties. Where am I going? I will die here." What kind of spirit is this? The so-called head can be broken, blood can flow, and the body can be decayed, but this little bit of patriotic enthusiasm can never be erased. I am afraid that Xi Qia and Haipeng will follow suit and start an uprising. Therefore, I have recorded this piece of history again to tell those who are wielding spears for the country today. Do not be intimidated by the enemy, or be killed by the people of the country, and be punished by the writers of thousands of generations.</p>
<h3>World Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Crow Music Team The Music Team Among Birds. Westerners admire nightingales the most. Easterners admire orioles the most. Both can be seen in the works of poets. The sound of crows is harsh and cannot be pleasing to the ear. Moreover, in the old customs of the East, hearing the crow's cry early in the morning is considered an ominous sign. How can there be any appreciation? So what is this crow music team all about? It turns out that in Ghestar, England, the owner of a dairy farm, Mr. F. Bithell, keeps four crows, two males and two females. The first one is named Jackan. The second one is named Jami. Both are males. The third one is named Joni. The fourth one is named Bebe. Both are females. He himself loves music, so he trains them day and night to form a music team. They use bells, drums, cymbals, and triangular instruments, a total of four kinds. Among them, the most talented is Bebe. She can play eight bells. If someone asks her to play "The Old Folks at Home", she will first be shy and unwilling. But if you encourage her again, she will jump to the bells and tap them one by one with her beak. The ding-ding-dong-dong sound is very pleasant, and the tune is not wrong at all.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Exercise of the Women's Battlefield First Aid Team</h3>
<p>— Zhishi</p>
<p>Ever since the violent Japanese invaded Liaoji and coveted Menghei, the schools for men and women in Shanghai have had tragic and enthusiastic patriotic movements. The Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School in Ximen, this port, has also organized an anti-Japanese national salvation association in accordance with the work principles promulgated by the executive committee of the municipal party department. The established battlefield first aid team is particularly determined and decisive. After more than a month of lessons, the training has been completed. A swearing ceremony was held at 2:00 pm on the 21st of this month at the Tianjin Gong Qiao Municipal Chamber of Commerce to show its willingness to serve the country with sincere determination.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, the principal of the school, Lu Lihua, delivered an opening speech, reporting on the organizational process, and said that he had tested the willingness of each team member to serve the country on the evening of the 1st at 10:00 pm. Temporary mobilization. Departure to a certain place. And the students were able to gather in ten minutes and prepare to set off. They all rushed to be the first, and no one hesitated. Although the students' perseverance is commendable, I am honored that two ladies from the Women and Children's Hospital have enthusiastically taught the members of our school in their busy schedules. This initial first aid achievement can only be achieved. Their feelings cannot be ignored. The representatives of the municipal party department, the representatives of the municipal education bureau, and the school board member Chu Minyi gave speeches, and their words were mostly encouraging and pertinent.</p>
<p>The organizational content of the battlefield first aid team is five people as a team, a total of thirty teams. They each wear clean white nurses' clothes and nurses' hats. Their attitude is calm, quiet and solemn. It is a complete reversal of the usual state of dancing, throwing balls and throwing sticks when studying sports. Someone next to me whispered. This is the so-called "acting as an official and acting as a rite". During the exercise. For example, if the head is injured, the head can still be raised and lowered freely after applying the medicine. If the elbow is injured, the elbow can be bent and stretched as usual after bandaging. If the injury is serious and the whole body cannot move, a bed is prepared, covered with bedding and pillows. On top of the bedding, a dirty quilt is covered to wait for the injured person to sleep. Then slowly remove the clothes and quilts of the injured person and replace them with clean ones underneath. The surgery is quick and the injured person seems to suffer no pain. The two teaching ladies also explained to the public the symptoms of the injury and the simplicity and complexity of the first aid. Finally, they said that today's exercises are limited to obvious types. The complex ones that are not easy to present to the guests are not included in this example. It is a pity.</p>
<p>After the exercise, the chairman led all the team members to read the oath. The sound shook the house, showing a solemn and heroic spirit. Then two silver shields were presented to the two nurses, expressing their enthusiasm for assisting. After the meeting, a photo was taken with the guests in the aisle of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. It was already sunset.</p>

<h3>The Pestle of Knocking on Dreams (22)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>Tao was late to this place, and he realized the greatness and longevity of the present! He shouted three times! Long live the present!</p>
<p>He carefully investigated this palace of confusion, built on the foundation of the Washington Conference. How solid this foundation is! Above it is covered with the tiles of peace; around it is surrounded by the railings of justice; and there are also copper walls and iron walls, all made of materials from the item of shortening armaments. Above the three-character plaque, "Mountain-Backed Hall"; the eight-character couplet on both sides, "Safe as Mount Tai, Stable as a Rock"; accompanied by wonderful dances and entertained with clear songs.</p>
<p>Once he entered the palace of confusion, he was melted in the modern furnace! He did not know how many years, how many months, how many days, how many hours he lived; only because the modern paradise has abolished the years, months, days, and hours. At first, he was a little skeptical, but he finally deeply recognized it: only because he himself felt long and long, but once he arrived in the garden, the morning light still shone on the highest branch of the green peach blossom, the green peach blossom was still half-open, the flower branches were still reflected in a small pool of clear water, and the goldfish in the small pool were still playing with the swaying flower shadows; it can be seen that the morning light does not change, the green peach blossom does not change, the flower shadows do not change, and the goldfish do not change; this can prove this sentence "The present is long and unchanging".</p>
<p>He was broken by the modern trend of his original ambition base - the ambition not to read erotic novels; since entering the palace of confusion, it is not enough to comfort his present mind without reading erotic novels! He also vowed not to listen to erotic songs; since entering the palace of confusion, it is not enough to inspire his present interest without listening to erotic songs! Other than that, everything he did not want to do, dare not do, and could not bear to do in his daily life; since entering the palace of confusion, he did not want not to do, dare not not to do, and could not bear not to do! He thought that all erotic texts are suitable for the present works; he thought that school youths do not talk about science but talk about love, which is the knowledge that should be had now; he thought that the dull science is bad reading material that violates people's immediate happiness; he thought that the four words "worrying about the country and the people" are useless nouns deleted in the modern dictionary: he thought that it is an appropriate way in the doctrine of immediate happiness to use the ever-changing imported goods of other countries to light up our material civilization without having to set up factories to manufacture them ourselves; it is believed that buying the ever-changing guns and bullets of other countries is the most economical way to prepare weapons for the breakup of the Greater China Brothers Company!</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Plunge Violently</h3>
<p>Re-entering the 700 Taels Mark</p>
<p>Plunging by Sixteen Taels and Six [Qian] Yesterday, the price of gold fell even more violently on the 23rd. The chaos was difficult to handle, with twists and turns of two or three taels to six or seven taels at every turn. The psychology of the industry has become weak, and the selling atmosphere is pervasive. The silver market fell slightly, especially because the League of Nations still could not solve the problem with Japan, so the market opened low. Afterwards, the Guang Gang sold fiercely. It is also said that the current money supply is tight, so there is a fear that no one will accept the spot goods, and the market is weaker. Therefore, the market broke through 710 taels. The market felt even more sluggish. It is now said that the countries have notified the violent Japanese that they must withdraw their troops by the 16th of next month, and the exchange rate is very loose. Therefore, the price of gold suddenly broke into the 700 taels mark. The waves rose and the sellers were excited, but the rise and fall were unpredictable. Afterwards, it plummeted by more than sixteen taels.</p>
<p>The Morning Opening Showed a Weak Trend From the early opening of 713 taels and 5 qian, a drop of 2 taels and 6 qian was recorded. However, the big silver bar also fell by 16/3 of a cent, and the price of silver fell by a quarter. However, the European market was strong, so it was not moved. Afterwards, Dadecheng, Yifengyong and others bought in, and immediately added to 15 taels of money. The bank absorbed 31 yuan and 75 cents of US dollars, and then turned loose. The British gold was settled at 1.7125 to 1.875, and was sold by Tong Taichang, Hengchangyong, Yuanmaoyong, Ruichang, etc. It fell by 5 taels, only 710 taels and 2 qian. The British gold was announced to be unchanged. Yifengyong and others sold on the market, and it was reduced to 0.09 taels and 8 qian. At that time, it was added to 0.11 taels and 2 qian. After a while, Fuchang, Hengchangyong and others came out again, and Guang Gang made a settlement of US dollars, totaling 31 yuan 75 cents to 8125, to about 10 o'clock, only 0.09 taels. Shunli, Wanxing, Yuanheng and others came in, and immediately added to 0.11 taels and 9 qian. However, the situation was not good and people's hearts were downstream. Hengxing entrusted Yifengyong to sell, and Daxingyong, Dadecheng, Fuchang and others followed suit. Later, Mitsui sold March British gold 1.725, and Maihang sold January 3.125, so the price of gold fell sharply by 5 taels and 3 quarters to 0.07 taels. At that time, Yuanheng and others continued to buy in, and had pulled up more than 4 taels. After 11 o'clock, it was 0.11 taels and a half.</p>
<p>After that, Yifengyong, Hengchangyong, Richang, Xiexingyong, Tanfengyong, and those with goods for hedging tended to sell out. The situation was not good, and people's hearts were afraid of emptiness. The price fell more and more, and plummeted by 7 taels. At 11:45, it was only 0.04 taels and a half. After entering, there was a fluctuation of one or two taels. It then closed from 0.06 taels to 0.05 taels. The announced price was more than 770 taels, which was a decrease of 70 taels.</p>
<p>The Market Feels Even More Sluggish The market opened at 0.03 taels and a half, followed by 0.04 taels and 8 qian to 0.02 taels and 8 qian. There were not many transactions. After a while, it was raised to 0.04 taels and 2 qian, which was purchased by retail households. After 2:15, British gold could be settled at 1.75. It is said that the Bombay telegraph sold British gold at 1.75, but the bank did not accept it. On the market, Fuchang, Daxingyong, Shunli and others sold a lot. Then, Huayin Bank sold January British gold 5.625, and Shanghai absorbed 6.25. The market was sluggish, so the price of gold plummeted by six or seven taels. After 2:30, it suddenly fell to 697 taels and 5. Afterwards, there was a fluctuation of two taels. At 3 o'clock, Mitsui sold British gold 6.25. After that, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yifengyong, Hengyu, Yuanmaoyong and others all entered. The US dollar seemed to be flat. Japanese banks sold 32 yuan and 5625, and the price of gold broke through 700 taels. Afterwards, it was added by two or three taels. The US dollar was 32 yuan 4375, and the bank may have eaten it. At 3:45, it was 703 taels. In an instant, Shengda came to sell, and the number was not enough. The wind suddenly changed, and it broke 700 taels again, totaling 698 taels and 5. When the market closed at 4:30, it was 99 taels and a half, which was a decrease of 16 taels and 6 qian compared with the previous day. After the close, it was made to 701 taels. Yuanmaoyong entered again, but in the end it was suppressed to the 700 taels mark. In short, the market is complex, and people's hearts are still hesitant.</p>
<p>The Spot Only Added Nine Taels According to the largest of the day, 715 taels and 5, and the smallest, 97 taels and 5, there was a circulation of 18 taels. The goods were 14 taels and 5 in the morning, 0.05 taels at noon, and 0.04 taels in the afternoon. The market closed at 700 taels. The announced price was a decrease of more than 70 taels. The registration supplement was 0.05 taels. In the afternoon, it was 700 taels. The bare silver bar has dropped to 9 taels.</p>
<p>The Market Has a Strong Selling Atmosphere The transactions on the table show that there are more supply than demand. Statistics show that Dadecheng, Cuichangyong, Tong Taichang, Wanxing, Yuankangxiang and Yuanheng have all entered. Yuhe, Yuantai, Yuanmaoyong, Shunli, Xiexingyong and Qianchangxiang have frequent inflows and outflows. Hengxing, Shengda, Yifengyong, Zhifengyong, Fuchang and Daxingyong have all exited. Hengchangyong successively sold 1,500 or 1,600 bars. In the afternoon, Hengchangyong, Yifengyong, Tong Taichang, Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong and Yuanheng all entered. Fuchang and Daxingyong exited and re-entered. Qianchangxiang, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Senchangyong, Dakang and Yichang had different inflows and outflows. Hengxing and Shengda sold more than 1,000 bars again. Speculator Wu entered and exited about 1,000 bars before and after the market. Also, those who hedged exchange rates sold out. They made settlements on both British and American exchange rates. Dalian Gang entered 1,000 and exited 1,400 or 1,500. Guang Gang exited 2,300 or 2,400, including hedging transactions.</p>
<h3>The Exchange Market Turns Slightly Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and Silver markets continued to fall, but the market situation seemed strong, and there were few sellers. The British and American exchange rates suddenly turned down, but the Shanghai market felt particularly loose. However, the situation is complicated. The gold market is due to the deterioration of the situation, and the problem of violent Japan is also difficult to solve. People's hearts are alarmed, and the price broke into the 700 taels mark. The HSBC listing has slightly changed, with the Indian exchange rate reduced by 75, the French franc reduced by 5 yuan, the German exchange rate reduced by a small mark, and Hong Kong reduced by 125, totaling 77 taels 875. However, the British, American, and Pohe exchange rates have not risen or fallen. As a result, compared with the previous day, the British gold was half a penny longer, and the US dollar was 875 longer. Chinese merchants mostly bought in, slightly offsetting the previous short positions. There were also some who exchanged gold, and the US dollar was far away, totaling about 37 or 38 taels, which was really the relationship that there was no receiver for the spot gold. It is estimated that about 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded, and Chinese banks all sold it. It is also estimated that there were a total of 600,000 or 700,000 US dollars, and Guang Gang Shengda and others kept up their efforts to buy in. The listed price was about 3 taels, 2 qian, 2 fen, 5.8.</p>

<h3>Difficulties in Regulating Silver Dollar Market</h3>
<p>Yang Cents Soar by Three Cents</p>
<p>"Hua Tou" Reaches Six "Qian"</p>
<p>Market Overview: The silver dollar market has been tense for several days, attracting considerable attention from society. The situation yesterday and the day before became even more serious. Yesterday afternoon's meeting lasted for more than an hour, adjourning at twenty minutes past two. This shows the inside story of the situation and the dilemma faced by those involved. The rise in Yang cent yesterday was purely due to purchases by small banks, which was also to protect their own foundations. If they absorbed it indiscriminately, the market might be even worse than it is now.</p>
<p>Cent Exchange Rate: The morning market cent rate for "Yang Cents" was firm, starting half a cent higher than the previous morning, at 7 "qian" 2 "fen" 7 "li" 1 "hao" 2 "hu" and a half. The afternoon market saw small banks making large purchases, causing sellers to disappear. As a result, the cent rate soared by three cents, to 7 "qian" 3 "fen" 0 "li" 1 "hao" 2 "hu" and a half. The tightness of the situation was no less than that of the money market. The morning and afternoon markets for "Qian Exchange" remained at 5 "qian," similar to the previous day, but the tension behind the scenes was hard to describe. Some people initially made "Hua Tou" add water, reaching 6 "qian," but the final result was 3 "qian" 2 "fen" 3 "li." Bank quotations were 2 "qian."</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: The morning and afternoon markets for Jiangnan small silver coins remained the same as the previous day due to a complete lack of transactions, at 6 "qian" 5 "fen" 8 "li." The morning market for Guangdong small silver coins was 6 "qian" 5 "fen" 4 "li" and a half, and the afternoon market was 6 "qian" 5 "fen" 5 "li" 7 "hao" and a half, resulting in a rise of 1 "li" 2 "hao" and a half. Recently, the money market has been extremely tight, and no one has shown interest in these transactions, and even if there are any, they are few and far between. Transactions were 101,000 "jiao" in the morning market and 75,000 "jiao" in the afternoon market. Copper coins rose by 1,000 "wen," to 377,500 "wen," with transactions of over 29,000 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds" During this time of urgent money shortage, bank receipts and disbursements were quiet. Chinese merchants received and disbursed over 2.8 million in notes, foreign merchants received and disbursed 1.5 to 1.6 million in notes, various cargo, exchange, tax, and miscellaneous funds received and disbursed over 7 million, special funds over 2 million, collateral transactions over 300,000, warehouse entry 1.3 million, money shops and silver public notes received and disbursed over 47.7 million, "Hua Tou" funds received and disbursed over 4.1 million, various exchange funds received and disbursed over 400,000, and cash disbursement was still over 1 million. "Foreign Funds" The morning market made 1.235 million in exchange notes, and the afternoon market made 920,000. Banknotes were 50,000 in the morning market and 30,000 in the afternoon market. Off-site banknotes were 125,000 in the morning market and 65,000 in the afternoon market. Bank trading saw inter-market trading of 700,000 in the morning market, and purchases of 700,000 and sales of only 300,000 in the afternoon market. Various bank foreign accounts received and disbursed over 1.8 million, banknote inflow and outflow over 2 million, money shops and foreign public notes received and disbursed over 4.5 million, foreign "Hua Tou" funds received and disbursed over 2.2 million, foreign exchange borrowing inflow and outflow over 1.5 million, small money shop transactions over 500,000, and customer account transactions over 500,000.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Continue Weak Trend, Slight Flattening</h3>
<p>Demobilization Recent Salt Tax Forward Contracts Fall More Than Two Yuan</p>
<p>Remaining Small Amounts Around One Yuan, Consolidated Tax Only Shrinks by a Few Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 23rd), the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange's various bond markets were as active as before in the futures market, with brisk trading in the afternoon market, but the spot market was quieter than the previous day. Most bonds had no transactions. At the beginning of the morning, market sentiment was weak, and prices once continued to fall sharply compared to the previous day. However, they soon rebounded. Looking at the overall trend of various bond prices throughout the day, it was very chaotic. Except for a few with larger fluctuations, the rest generally returned to the previous level. The market situation seemed to have improved slightly, but only the next month's contract for the 19 customs bonds was slightly higher by a few cents compared to the previous day. All other bonds continued to fall, with the demobilization October contract falling by 2 yuan and 6 jiao, and the salt tax November contract falling by 2 yuan and 3 jiao and a half. Others also continued to fall by small amounts of around 1 yuan, while the consolidated tax slightly shrank by 3 or 4 jiao. This was because the diplomatic situation was dull yesterday, with no progress, and general market sentiment was quite pessimistic. Looking at the future of the bond market, if there is no turning point in the diplomatic situation and no significant progress in the domestic situation, the securities market will ultimately be difficult to improve before delivery. Total spot trading for the day was only 9,000 yuan, while futures trading reached over 9.8 million in the morning and 5.1 million in the afternoon, totaling about 15 million yuan. The consolidated tax accounted for over 3.1 million, the 20 customs bonds about 2.8 million, and the salt tax also had 2.4 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Weaker Downward Trend in Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned weak, with a strong downward trend. Due to the downward trend of foreign cotton, frequent rumors about the situation, and extremely tight money, market sentiment is fearful. The market is quite bullish, and the market is moving downwards. However, Dafu Hao has purchased a lot. Currently, there is a shortage of low-end 16s and 20s yarns, but the sales of 10s coarse yarn are too sluggish.</p>
<p>"Ren Biao" Turns Weak, Falling by One or Two "Liang" Externally: The opening of the morning market for "Ren Biao" was affected by the decline in foreign cotton and the surge in silver exchange rates, leading to scattered market sentiment. Prices for various months fell by 3, 4, 7, and 9 "qian." In the afternoon, prices for various months fell again by 5, 6, 7, and 8 "qian." Total transactions for the day were 22,600 bales. Gengfeng sold 3,150 bales, Yichang sold 2,650 bales, Changfeng sold 1,500 bales, and Taixing sold 2,450 bales. Gongtai bought 600 bales, Dafu bought 5,750 bales, and Hengde bought 2,150 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>"Ren Biao" Closing Price Account Balance "Ren Biao" Closing Price Account Balance</p>
<p>October 160.4 Down 1.6 26,250 January 159.5 Down 0.9 102,750</p>

<p>December 159.9 Down 0.9 95,800 March 159.2 Down 1.2 63,500</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Stagnant: Spot yarn sales are average. Total purchases by "Bang Mai" for the day were 650 bales, with 275 bales purchased by colleagues. The market is generally weak. Among customer purchases, 75 bales were purchased by Sichuan, 120 bales by inland areas, 240 bales by Guangdong, 65 bales by Jiangxi, and 100 bales by miscellaneous buyers.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Declines Due to Poor Environment</h3>
<p>The cotton market is generally weak due to the softening trend of American cotton and the decline in gold prices. Trading in local cotton is also very rare. Imports of foreign cotton by various factories are very smooth, so the overall situation remains weak. As for American cotton, production is very abundant and the base stock is thick. After rising 120 points on a low price basis, the continued upward momentum is weakening. Moreover, the economies of various countries around the world are still in a state of panic, and consumption is difficult to improve significantly. Local cotton prices are also high, so speculators are all leaning towards short selling.</p>
<p>"Han Biao" Falls Back by Three to Four "Qian": The opening of the morning market for "Han Biao" was affected by the fall in American cotton by 20 points and the decline in gold prices, leading to scattered market sentiment. There were more sellers in the market, and prices fell by 2 to 3 "qian." In the afternoon, prices fell again by 0.5 to 1 "qian." Total transactions for the day were 98,900 dan. Gongtai sold 7,100 dan, Tongxing sold 2,600 dan, Yichang sold 4,500 dan, Tianlong sold 3,400 dan, Deji sold 4,600 dan, Xinheng sold 2,700 dan, and Taichang sold 2,400 dan. Hengde bought 11,000 dan, Rongxing bought 3,200 dan, Gengfeng bought 2,500 dan, and Ruida bought 4,000 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Foreign Cotton Rises and Falls Differently</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to the slump on Wall Street, leading to reactive selling and a decrease in buyers. Futures fell by 13 to 21 points, and spot fell by 10 points. British cotton futures rose by 6 points, and spot rose by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 5 points. Indian cotton was firm at the close due to purchases by European exporters. Pingguoer rose by 2 rupees, Omra rose by 2.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 2.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (telegram of the 22nd):</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Downstream</h3>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, the rice supply from the west was slightly scarce, and transactions in this street were increasingly sluggish. High prices were stable, while intermediate grades gradually moved downstream. New japonica rice from Changshu and Xixi, as well as japonica rice from Tongli Beidu, still arrived in large quantities, with prices at 2 jiao. Township buyers slightly purchased kiln-grown red and white rice, with no price increase or decrease. New and old Luyang pointed rice were sluggish due to poor handling, falling by nearly a jiao.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday's transactions were extremely light, with very few people visiting the market in the morning. The market trend was unpredictable. The top grade of new japonica rice did not change, while ordinary grades tended to be worth 2 jiao. New Baige rice transactions were very strong, with tea shops actively purchasing, and the market was also firm. Old broken milled rice had very limited outlets and no ups or downs. Lupu pointed rice was affected by the new customer pointed rice, opening lower by 1 or 2 jiao and declining downstream at 2 yuan per section. Deliveries to Lupu were in the thirties and forties, with river bottom shipments of nearly 3,000 dan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Prices Rise Abroad</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were few imports and exports of foreign rice due to the suspension of customer purchases and market observation in this street. Spot transactions were quiet. Yesterday, only this street handled the import of 200 bags of secondary small twisted rice imported by Nissan, priced at 10 yuan and 4 jiao and a half. Futures prices were rising abroad, and foreign firms no longer lowered prices to solicit business, so the market situation turned stable. However, importer appetite was also sluggish, and there were no transactions for whole bags in the unified market.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Unstable</h3>
<p>Import of Foreign Wheat Continues: Russian Wheat Also Reported as Surplus</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market turned to a flat and sluggish trend again. Foreign wheat quotations have fallen back by a small 2 or 3 jiao, and the ordered foreign wheat is being imported in large quantities. Currently, Russian wheat is still in surplus. Once prices are high, it will inevitably take advantage of the situation to come to China, so market sentiment is unstable. Compared to the closing prices of the previous day, prices have fallen back by 2 or 3 cents. However, the market sentiment for later, more distant months has slightly rebounded due to customers seeing抢进 again. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, it was still generally soft, but later, customers continued to buy the far months, causing it to gradually rebound again. However, the buying was not smooth, and the height was not much. As a result, the current month fell by 1 and a half cents compared to the previous day, November and December fell by a small 2 and a half cents, January and February fell by a small 5 li, and March fell by a small 2 and a half li.</p>
<h3>Many Importers of Distant Month Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, the market for each month, due to the small foreign wheat report, market sentiment saw fatigue, and near and far months had retreated by a small two, three, or four points compared to the previous day. Soon, due to the strong buying interest of inland gangs and local customers, market sentiment gradually rose again. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, it was also flat, but general speculative buyers predicted that those who had ordered foreign wheat would definitely find it difficult to be as smooth as a few months ago due to the money situation, so they entered as soon as they saw a small price, which felt quite strong. Therefore, the distant months rebounded by 4 or 5 points. The current month remained spiritless due to delivery relations. As a result, the current month was down by a small 2 points compared to the previous day, November was unchanged, December was up by 3 points, January and February each rose by 5 points, and March rose by 4 points.</p>
<h3>Dried Jujube Prices in North-South Goods Market Worsen</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of dried jujubes have become increasingly sluggish, and there are still many stocks in the market, resulting in supply exceeding demand and market prices gradually trending downwards. Yesterday's market prices, such as Shangzhuang's Hui 工禿禿, only sold for 22 taels, and Lanxi's 禿禿, the higher ones were 21 taels, and the next one was 20 taels. The upper and lower grades still added or deducted as usual. It is found that the cost of goods from cargo customers is high, so none of those engaged in this business are not losing money.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea European and American Silk Sales Remain Clear</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in the Japanese port of 洋庄 still tended to be clear and firm. Because the white factory 经厂 sales in places such as London and Lyons were not moving and the telegrams were sluggish, although there were telegrams for New York B-grade factory 经, the prices were still small. The uniform price of the upper body 83 was similar to the middle body. The factory's loss was worrying, and there were still no transactions. Yesterday, only European factories supplemented the shortage of goods, including Renji and other Huaihu white factory 经 20 bales, Xinfu entered white dry 经 20 bales, and Kechang entered coarse yellow silk 5 bales. The prices were still firm.</p>
<h3>There is Motivation for Foreign Sales of Centrifuge-Extracted Zhenmei Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the tea market of 洋庄 in the Japanese port, Jinlong Foreign Firm, an English firm from 婺源 Tunxi and other roads, resumed negotiations and pricing for centrifuge-extracted Zhenmei tea. There was motivation in the market, but the industry recognized the prices too low, and the market situation could not develop. Transactions for needle eyebrows and show eyebrows were still not lonely, and the sales disc also saw no change from before. For Gongxi, the Russian Assistance Association recently announced another suspension, and Baitouzhuang also tightened prices compared to before. The tea market still had falling prices and no rising prices.</p>
<h3>Clothing Made of German and French Woolens Sells Well</h3>
<p>Woolen goods and clothing are now selling briskly in time. Thin goods such as Serge Walter wool, fancy wool, chocolate Gongzhitougou wool, etc., thick goods such as Melton plain thick wool, printed rotten mud wool, domestic camel, iridescent, plaid overcoat wool, pearl wool, Lingtou wool, felt wool, and all kinds of velvet, etc., retail and wholesale transactions are quite prosperous. Goods from Germany and France have been performing well recently, and sales prices are also firm. The market atmosphere of the guild has also suddenly improved as a result. The goods of German and French foreign firms such as Baoduo, Huafa, Ningfeng, Lihe, Lulin, and Kongshi sell particularly well. This is because since Japanese goods were resisted, investigated, and sealed up, the sales market for German and French goods has suddenly turned smooth.</p>
<h3>Coal Weather Clear, Coal Slurry Sales Brisk</h3>
<p>Various kinds of white coal slurry have been selling briskly recently. The green weather has been clear for a long time, and the coal and coal slurry are dry. Various local and foreign buyers have purchased in large quantities. Recently, various wharves in Pudong have been loading and shipping spot goods, with as many as four or five hundred tons per day. Therefore, the selling price is stable. The market price yesterday was 10 taels and 0.5 qian for Hongzhi slurry, 8 taels and 5 qian for Mark slurry, 9 taels and 7.5 qian for Fengtian slurry, 9 taels for Shanxi slurry, and 7 taels for Liujiang slurry.</p>
<h3>Hardware Flag White Iron's Sharpness Slightly Wanes</h3>
<p>Since the cessation of imports of Flag white iron from the East, various parties have been very enthusiastic about adding to their stocks, so the trend has been very sharp. Among the various patterns, such as the 48-sheet type, those who added stocks later had almost no goods to buy. The most recent trend is that British goods have been frequently stacked and arrived, and their prices are slightly lower than American goods, so buyers are all eager to receive them. Therefore, the sales of American goods have been hit, and the standard opening price has also softened slightly. Currently, the 48-sheet post-load opens at 19 taels, the 28-gauge at 18 taels and 5 qian, the 26-gauge at 17 taels and 3.5 qian, and the 24-gauge at 16 taels and 7.5 qian. The most recent market price of British white iron is estimated at 17 taels and 7.5 qian for Red Bird iron, 17 taels and 5 qian for Comet Huang iron, 16 taels and 7.5 qian for the 28-gauge, and 15 taels and 3.5 qian for the 26-gauge, and 14 taels for the 24-gauge. This estimate is cheaper than American goods, so most customers are happy to purchase it, so the sales of American goods have to be slightly deserted.</p>

<h3>Important Report by Guangdong Peace Representatives Wang Jingwei and Others</h3>
<p>News Media Hosted Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Seek Unification Through Construction</p>
<p>Seek Co-governance Through Equal Rights</p>
<p>Guangdong peace representatives Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, Chen Youren, Li Wenfan, Zou Lu, and others hosted the news media at 3 p.m. yesterday at Wu's residence, No. 29 Gordon Road. More than 100 reporters from various newspapers attended. After refreshments, Wang Jingwei and Sun Ke successively gave reports. Then, the reporters asked various important questions. Wang, Sun, Chen, Wu, Zou and others answered the questions item by item. Wang and Sun's important reports and Q&amp;A are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Jingwei's Report</h3>
<p>Gentlemen of the press, brothers, when I arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, I saw many reporters at the pier. I was very grateful in my heart at the time. However, the time was too rushed then, and I was unable to report everything in detail. Today, taking this opportunity to gather with all of you gentlemen, my colleagues and I are very pleased. When I was in Shanghai before, I had the intention of being able to talk freely with friends in the press. Today, this opportunity has been achieved. Regarding news reporting, it has always been unfree in various places, because it has to go through censorship procedures. Perhaps there will be many messages that will be misunderstood, so it is also necessary to talk to all of you gentlemen in detail once. Yesterday, when Mr. Chiang arrived in Shanghai, my colleagues and I requested in person that newspapers no longer be censored so that everyone would have the opportunity to freely express their will. This system is clearly stated in the Outline of National Reconstruction. The system of balanced power, if it is not implemented in China for one day, the political disputes in China will not stop for one day. It is necessary to implement the system of balanced power before politics can get on the right track, so as to avoid the situation since the founding of the Republic of China, where autocratic and dictatorial regimes are easily created under the guise of centralism, or warlord separatism is created under the guise of local decentralization. "Seeking unification through construction, seeking common governance through balanced power," although they are two different sentences, their significance is actually the same, because they are both fundamental principles of governing the country. Only when these two principles can be implemented can financial, diplomatic, and other matters be resolved. Since the establishment of the National Government in Guangdong on May 28, we have been doing things according to this purpose. This is also the reason why we do not easily use force. From May to October, for five months, although the two sides have adopted a confrontational posture, no military disaster has occurred. This is something to be comforted by. Guangdong has already started local autonomy during these months, and I believe that there will be results in the near future. I tell you all so that you can criticize. When we were in the process of handling these matters, representatives from Ningbo came to Guangzhou, expressing their hope for peaceful unification. Peaceful unification has always been our hope, so we will seek unification through construction and seek common governance through balanced power. Wang Jingwei.</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang has already given a definite reply yesterday, and this point is not a problem. This point has already been achieved, and in the future, there will be opportunities to regularly provide news to the press, and at the same time, there will be opportunities to accept criticism from the press. This is a pleasant thing. Of course, the events of the past few years cannot be explained clearly in this short period of time. The disintegration of the party and the country in the past few years was a last resort. If there were no reasons of last resort, there would be no such things today. The Central Extraordinary Conference and the National Government were established in Guangzhou on May 27 and 28, respectively. When the members of the Guangdong National Government took office, they made two rather important remarks, namely, "Seeking unification through construction, seeking common governance through balanced power." Since the establishment of the Republic of China, everyone has always believed that unification by force is the only way to unify. In fact, if unification is only possible by force, then it is now the 20th year of the Republic of China, how could there still be such a situation? In fact, the more unification is sought by force, the further away it is from the goal. The inability of force to achieve unification can be proven by facts. Therefore, the colleagues of the Extraordinary Conference feel that if they want to unify the country in the future, they must change their methods. Therefore, since the establishment of the Guangdong National Government, they have never focused on military preparations. What they have focused on has always been local construction. The success of local construction has a greater effect than military force, because if they rely solely on military force, the result will be that finances and other aspects will become chaotic. If finances are chaotic, nothing can be done. The people will not have faith in the government, so it is necessary to work on construction. If the country's money is used for construction to seek happiness for the people, on the one hand, the people can trust the government, and the people of the local government can also trust themselves. Only when construction is successful can there be hope for unification. In the 20 years of the Republic of China, the work of construction has been neglected, resulting in such disintegration. In the past, those who governed China always had unclear disputes over the system of centralization and decentralization. What the Premier of our party advocated was not to lean towards centralization or decentralization, but to adopt balanced power. We then started to implement it. After the news of the Japanese atrocities came on September 19, my colleagues felt that there was an urgent need to seek unity to resist foreign aggression. The purpose of our organization of the National Government is to seek the establishment of a democratic political foundation, not to address the issue of a certain person. At this time of national crisis, it is necessary to seek internal unification first. Only when the country is unified can foreign affairs be handled. Since September, the idea of peaceful unification has been urgently pursued. In October, after the arrival of Mr. Cai, Zhang, and Chen in Guangdong, the process of peaceful unification became even smoother. The day before yesterday, my colleagues and I arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, we met with Mr. Chiang and discussed some methods regarding various systems and the establishment of democratic politics. Mr. Chiang also expressed his agreement in person. Perhaps some people think, why don't we go to Nanjing immediately? Regarding this point, I would like to explain to you in particular, because the disintegration of the party and the government cannot be permanently resolved without a proper plan for fundamental improvement. Our intention is not just to seek temporary unity, so we must prevent random disintegration. Since the difficulties of the party and the country must be thoroughly broken, we have come to Shanghai to seek a solution. Our lives are not very important, but the respect for freedom of will is important. If there is no respect for freedom of will, then what is the value of discussing freedom of will? It is ten or a hundred times more important than life. We have come to Shanghai to discuss fundamental solutions and concrete methods for resolving past disputes. The peace we hope for is real peace, and the unification we seek is real unification. Only in this way can the problems of the party and the country be truly resolved, and the difficulties of military affairs, politics, and finance can be broken. These matters cannot be dealt with casually. Everyone must discuss them calmly at a table and judge them based on reason, so that evil causes will not be planted again in the future. Therefore, the discussions in Shanghai are not meaningless, and staying in Shanghai for a few more days will allow us to have more opportunities to contact people from all walks of life in Shanghai. We can report any news to all circles at any time, and at the same time, we can directly explain any doubts or opinions from all circles to you. I am very happy to meet with you today. Regarding other questions, such as the recent diplomatic peace and the conflict between the police and the people in Guangzhou during the Double Ten Festival, and other various matters, if you have any questions for us, we have many comrades who can answer them for you.</p>
<h3>Mr. Sun Zhexian's Report</h3>
<p>Gentlemen of the press, Mr. Wang has just reported the recent situation clearly. I will add a few more points. These days, comrades from Guangdong have come to Shanghai entirely to discuss a concrete plan to prepare for an all-out effort against foreign aggression. If we do not seek peaceful unification and an all-out effort against foreign aggression, we would not have come to discuss it. What we are discussing now is the issue of methods. The method of peaceful unification must be thoroughly decided in order to ensure that China will not have disputes again in the future. This peaceful consultation is not about the affairs of the Ningbo government or the Guangdong government, nor is it about the affairs within the Kuomintang, but about the life and death of the entire Chinese nation. All the people of the country should study and discuss it, and they cannot shirk their responsibility and ignore it. At this time of urgent national crisis, if the people do not take this opportunity to unite their strength, think of a good method, and establish democratic forces, I am afraid that the current difficulties cannot be dealt with. For the past few years, China has been concentrating on military affairs, and has mostly used military force to seek unification. China's military strength can be said to be the largest in the world, with nearly 1.1 or 1.2 million soldiers. But what is the use of these 1.1 or 1.2 million soldiers? Japan sent one or two divisions of soldiers, and the entire Northeast has already been taken away. Our Chinese army still says that it is not resisting. Japan's ambition to invade the Northeast has existed for a long time and has long been an open secret. We want to find a method of resistance, not starting from today, but when will we have sufficient strength? This is really a big question. Now when it comes to this question, we must admit the facts. China has not yet become a modern country, and the conditions for national survival are not yet complete. The old country has already collapsed, and the new country has not yet been organized. The Northeast problem has been a major problem for decades, and China has not had a single solution. If there is still no solution today after decades without, then we can only let Japan slaughter us every day. A country, in order to resist other external forces, must have a political system that is on track, and at the same time, it must strengthen the economic capabilities of the people in order to find a way to survive. However, national construction is an urgent and important task. Not only do my colleagues have to take responsibility for this view, but the people should also share the responsibility for this hardship. Today we are hosting all of you, and if you have any intention to express, we will definitely answer you to the best of our knowledge and with a sincere attitude.</p>
<h3>Mr. Chen Youren's Reply</h3>
<p>I originally didn't want to speak, but since arriving in Shanghai, I have heard many rumors, which force me to say a few words. To the outside world, China is united. The Northeast Incident is a very difficult matter. In a nutshell, the diplomatic policy should be based on not losing any of China's interests. We once wanted a unified government to back up a unified diplomacy, and a unified country to back up a unified government. Recently, I heard some news saying that when I went to Japan last time, I was selling Manchuria. I feel very surprised. You all know my past history, and future facts can further prove that I did not go to Japan last time to sell Manchuria, but to save Manchuria. (Reporter asks) When the League of Nations cannot resolve the Manchuria Incident, will diplomatic means or military means be adopted? (Chen replies) The question itself has already answered it. This</p>

<p>From right to left: Liao Lu, Chen Youren, Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Wang Jingwei, and Wu Chaoshu, six gentlemen</p>
<p>question, does China now have the military force to fight Japan? This goes without saying. It is the responsibility of the responsible political leaders of China to make this fact clear to the Chinese people. Then what else can be used if not diplomatic means? The Northeast Incident is indeed a very difficult incident, but it is not an incident that cannot be resolved. In a few days, I will issue a major statement on this issue. I believe that this statement can satisfy the people of the whole country. (Another reporter asks) Is an alliance with Russia beneficial to our country? (Chen replies) No. (Asks) Why? (Chen replies) I can't say in detail, but you must know that the establishment of an alliance is not about the relationship between the two governments, but about the will of the people of the two countries. Do the Chinese people now have the will to demand an alliance with Russia? I don't think so now. Maybe there will be in the future, but the questioner's meaning may be referring to the restoration of diplomatic relations with Russia. (Reporter replies) I am referring to cooperation with Russia against Japan. Chen replies, That's completely different. We not only want to cooperate with Russia against Japan, but we want to cooperate with all countries in the world against Japan.</p>
<h3>Reporter asks</h3>
<p>(1) When was Mr. Chiang's resignation telegram sent? Does the Guangdong side insist on this proposal? What about the problem of Song Ziwen of the Ministry of Finance? Will the government organization be reorganized after the peace talks are successful in the future? (2) What is the diplomatic policy towards Japan? What steps will be taken? (3) What is the attitude towards the people's movement?</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingwei replied that at the beginning of September, Mr. Chiang sent someone to Guangdong to discuss the matter, saying that the matter of resignation could be handled. Later, we proposed a method. In the political aspect, we should first convene a unified conference, and a unified government should be produced by the unified conference. In the party affairs aspect, we should convene the first, second, and third committees to unite sincerely and resolve all party affairs issues. Later, after meeting with Mr. Cai, Zhang, and Chen, the Guangdong side drafted the telegrams for Chiang's resignation and the cancellation of the Guangdong government. Later, Mr. Chiang had some concerns and could not issue them immediately, and the wording had to be revised and modified. He asked us to issue them after we arrived in Shanghai. Mr. Chiang came to Shanghai the day before yesterday and was already prepared to issue them. Mr. Cai and others believed that once they were issued, people's hearts would be shaken. According to the original telegram, the Chiang faction would resign after the new government was established, and the Guangdong government would be cancelled. It was not immediately resign and immediately cancel. Before the new government is established, the old government is still responsible. As for when to issue it, the telegram must be discussed again before a decision can be made. As for the problem of Song Ziwen, it was not mentioned that day. However, we advocate that finances should be open. It is inappropriate for the people of the whole country to bear financial obligations without knowing the purpose of the finances. Therefore, we advocate that the government and the people jointly form a financial reorganization committee to specialize in reorganizing China's finances. Regarding the issue of the people's movement, I remember that Mr. Sun Zhesheng's opinion has already been published in today's newspaper. It seems that it is not necessary to say it now.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei talks about representatives of people's organizations attending the peace conference</h3>
<p>Will consult with the Ningbo side</p>
<p>Far East News Agency reported that regarding whether representatives of people's organizations can attend the peace conference, Wang Jingwei told a reporter from the Far East News Agency yesterday that the biggest purpose of this peace conference is to achieve thorough peace and unity throughout the country and jointly resist foreign aggression. Regarding the attendance of representatives of people's organizations at the peace conference, my colleagues expressed their sympathy. After consulting with the Nanjing representatives, a decision will be made. If one sector can participate, then all sectors can participate.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei reports the details of the conflict between the police and the people in Guangzhou during the Double Ten Festival</h3>
<p>Someone just asked about the incident on Yonghan Road in Guangzhou during the Double Ten Festival. Now I will report to you briefly. Since the news of the Japanese atrocities in the Northeast came to Guangdong, all sectors in Guangdong were very angry and outraged, and they organized anti-Japanese salvation associations one after another. At that time, three anti-Japanese salvation associations were established: one was the Anti-Japanese Salvation Congress of All Sectors, one was the Anti-Japanese Salvation Federation of Students in the City, and one was the Anti-Japanese Salvation Federation of the Press. At that time, the party headquarters strongly supported the patriotic movement of the people. However, while agreeing with the significance, it was considered inappropriate to have three groups, because in this way, the strength would not be concentrated, and the steps might be different. However, the central party headquarters did not want to take coercive methods and was already thinking of ways to ask them to unite into one. This was the situation of the people before the Double Ten Festival. As for the occurrence of the incident, it started at six o'clock on the evening of the Double Ten Festival, when a wounded soldier went to a New World grocery store on Yonghan Road to buy something, probably a thermos. After the wounded soldier looked at the goods, he said that they were Japanese goods. A companion said that they were not Japanese goods, so they had an argument. The wounded soldier threw the thermos on the ground. After their conflict, a team of Japanese goods inspectors happened to pass by, so they entered the store, searched for the goods, and burned them. The store partner turned off the lights and blew the whistle to warn. The police chief rushed to the scene and accused them of not following the procedures and burning the merchants' goods without proper procedures. They should have reported to the Anti-Japanese Association and the official authorities. The patrol team surrounded the police chief and beat him. The police chief fired a shot into the air to disperse them and took the wounded soldier back to the Yonghan Branch Bureau for questioning. The people reported to the Anti-Japanese Association one after another. The three Anti-Japanese Associations all received the report and thought that the police had arrested many people. The crowd besieged the police station. Chen Zejiao and Ma Huayi, representatives of the Student Anti-Japanese Association, came forward to ask the police station for the arrested students. The police station replied that they had not arrested any students. If they did not believe it, they could send someone in to check. Later, more and more people gathered, and the incident happened. Here, brothers, I will report in two aspects: (1) According to the report from the Academic Anti-Japanese Association and the Guangdong Machinery Workers' Union, it is said that later, more and more people gathered and swarmed in front of the gate. The student representatives explained on the spot that no one had been arrested, but it was ineffective. At that time, Yonghan Road was being repaired, and there were many stones. The crowd picked them up and threw them at the police station. The doors and windows of the police station were broken, and the watchtower and bamboo shed in front of the door were destroyed. They were about to rush into the bureau. Du Xuantai, the director of the branch bureau, called Chen Qingyun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to ask for a solution. Chen replied that shooting was never allowed. He had already asked the military police to send a team to the scene to suppress them, and they would arrive soon. Later,</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>More than 20 military police came, which was not enough to suppress them. The crowd was about to break down the door and enter the bureau, so the police fired and rushed out. Two people in the crowd died (not students) and 13 were injured. This is the report from the Student Anti-Japanese Association. When they came to the National Government to petition, the report was like this, and it has already been published in newspapers in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. (2) The police's report. The first half is the same as the report from the Student Anti-Japanese Association, but the second half is slightly different. It says that later, three people dressed in white clothes and yellow jackets mixed in the crowd and walked to the front of the door and threw three hand grenades into the bureau. Two of them did not explode, and one exploded. There are traces of the grenade on the lawn in the bureau. They said that the government could send someone to the bureau to check. The biggest point of attention in the above two different reports is that one says that stones were thrown, and the other says that in addition to stones, there were three hand grenades. The crux of the case lies in this point. If there really were hand grenades, then the police cannot be said to be wrong for self-defense. Otherwise, the police are wrong. Later, the police also came to petition, saying that this was a reasonable procedure for performing their duties. If they think there is something wrong with performing their duties, then our police can all resign. Therefore, on the 11th, the National Government was dealing with this difficult incident all day. Originally, the incident in the provincial capital of Guangdong should have been managed by the Guangdong Provincial Government, but because the people petitioned the National Government, the National Government had to take care of it. On the 11th, just when the people in Hong Kong were petitioning the National Government, the colleagues of the National Government had already decided on three points: (1) Immediately investigate the number of deaths and injuries, and provide medical treatment and compensation separately. The National Government sympathizes with the people. (2) Replace the director of the Public Security Bureau because of improper handling. (3) The director of the Yonghan Branch Bureau, Du Xuantai, will be detained immediately, and a special court will be organized for trial. The organization of the special court will be composed of two members sent by the High Court, one member from the Provincial Government, one member from the Municipal Government, two members from the Military Law Office, and five members from the General Headquarters of the First Army Corps for a public trial. Representatives of the people are allowed to participate as jurors. After the National Government replied that day, most of the people were satisfied and dispersed, but there were still</p>
<h3>Photo of reporters being received (taken by this museum)</h3>
<p>Thirty percent of the people were unwilling to disperse, saying that Du Xuantai must be shot immediately. The colleagues of the National Government replied that the government could not kill people casually without trial, and the people would not want the government to kill people casually. That day, this case was handled from morning to night. At the same time, we were always patient with the people and believed that their demand to shoot Du Xuantai immediately was motivated by the righteous indignation of the Yonghan Road incident and did not blame them. From 7:00 in the morning, the people petitioned the National Government until 7:00 in the evening, when the matter was resolved and the people dispersed one after another. The National Government ordered the military police headquarters to transfer Du Xuantai and the police officers who fired the shots from the Public Security Bureau to the military police headquarters. When the military police headquarters received the order from the National Government, it was already 4:00 or 5:00 in the evening. When they sent someone to the Public Security Bureau to escort Du Xuantai, who knew that Du Xuantai and the four people who were guarding Du Xuantai had colluded and escaped. Under the news heard by my colleagues, they were extremely angry. Whether Du Xuantai was guilty or not, the court would have a trial, and the verdict might not be death. His own escape was obviously a flight from guilt. The reputation of the Public Security Bureau was not good, and the reputation of the National Government was also affected. That day, I represented the National Government and spoke to the people, and I especially felt that I could not face the people. At the National Government meeting the next day, I requested permission to resign from my position as a national committee member, but all the committee members believed that I was elected by the colleagues of the National Government to speak to the people, and the responsibility should not be borne by me personally. Moreover, the National Government's handling of this incident was not deliberate, and the mistake was due to the negligence of the Public Security Bureau and the military police headquarters. Later, an order was issued to investigate and deal with the director of the Public Security Bureau, investigate and deal with the military police commander, severely punish the provincial government and heavily reward the wanted Du Xuantai and others for bringing them to justice. There is also one more point to report, that is, from the afternoon when the people petitioned the National Government, things changed somewhat. In the crowd, in various parts of the city, reactionary leaflets and slogans appeared, some of which were even marked as issued by the Communist Party. According to the news from the military police authorities, it was true that the Communist Party wanted to take the opportunity to expand the matter, set fires, and cause disturbances. Therefore, the government issued martial law to maintain order. When we came, we had already lifted the martial law. This incident happened on the ground where the revolution originated, which is of course very painful. If Du Xuantai has the results of the trial by the special court, the people's hearts can be comforted. Du Xuantai's escape has delayed the case. Although the responsibility lies in the delay and negligence of the military police headquarters and the Public Security Bureau, we also feel that we should apologize. After the incident, two people died and 13 were injured. It is not true that there were dozens of deaths and injuries. The components in the crowd that day were extremely complex. What these people had on them was unknowable. As for the bare-handed students, some people were also injured, which is really painful. Regarding the three hand grenades, of course, this is the most important key to this case. Whether there were hand grenades that day, the court is sending people to investigate and study. The two reports from the student side and the police side are different. The focus of the research is on this point. It is necessary to wait for the special court to conduct a detailed investigation before the facts can be clarified. You will always have a chance to know in the future.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>Twelfth Standing Committee Meeting of the Anti-Japanese Association</p>
<p>Passed measures to punish confiscated Japanese goods</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Salvation Association of this city held its twelfth standing committee meeting yesterday. The committee members present were Wang Yansong, Hu Shuhua, Lin Kanghou, Fang Jiaobo, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Tingrui, Yu Qiaqing, Fu Dewei, and Lu Jingshi. Chen Tingrui chaired the meeting and Zhao Shusheng recorded the minutes. The following cases were discussed: (1) The letter from Tongda Company stated that the Japanese sugar previously mortgaged to the Silver Company has no right to register. Now the company must clear the warehouse. Please allow them to re-register so that they can be redeemed and sealed. Please allow for flexibility. How should the case be handled? Resolution: A letter was sent to allow the redemption and hand it over to the trade association for sealing. (2) A letter from the informant Jiang Qilai requested a reimbursement of travel expenses to compensate for the loss. How should the case be handled? Resolution: A letter of thanks was sent, and the bonus was not allowed. (3) A letter from the Six District Enamelware Union stated that they were ordered to stop working on September 26 and participate in the Citizens' Congress. Whether the wages for that day will be deducted has not been clearly stated. Please instruct. Resolution: Forwarded to the Municipal Party Department. (4) Measures for punishing confiscated Japanese goods have been drafted. Please revise and approve the case. Resolution: Revised and approved, and reported to the Executive Committee.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to all industries to strictly inspect goods</h3>
<p>Special attention should be paid to stores in the concessions</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to all industry associations yesterday, stating: Dear Sirs, In the case of this month's 22nd case, according to the letter from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Salvation Association, since the Association issued a notice of economic severance, all sectors have been faithfully implementing the boycott. However, it has been found that the concessions are still flooded with enemy goods, which is everywhere. The number of reports and denunciations from the people is in the thousands. The Association is also restricted by the treaty and is not convenient to carry out inspections, which has caused disputes. It is found that the atrocities of the violent Japanese are causing the whole country to be filled with hatred. The concessions are still national territory, and merchants and people are still nationals. How can they forget their patriotism and allow discrimination? After the Executive Committee of the Association resolved, a letter was sent to your association, instructing all industry associations to quickly organize inspection groups, together with the Association, to carry out inspections to show fairness and consistency, to ensure that enemy goods are completely eradicated and to express popular anger. In the past, since the city has vigorously implemented the economic severance with Japan, the work of boycotting goods on the Chinese side has been seen as tight. The concessions have special relationships, and it is difficult to guarantee that they will not be blinded by short-term interests and openly buy and sell Japanese goods. Unless each industry conducts its own inspections, it will not be possible to achieve a consistent effect of boycotting goods. Therefore, a letter is sent to inform you, hoping that your association will investigate and follow up. If an inspection group has already been formed, staff should be sent to conduct strict inspections as soon as possible. If an inspection group has not been formed, it should be organized according to the case and carry out inspections, and so on.</p>
<h3>Halting the Alteration of Labels and Sale of Goods by Japanese</h3>
<p>Correspondence Between the Silk and Satin Industry and the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which stated: "We respectfully write to inform you that since the economic severance with Japan, various industries have spontaneously boycotted Japanese goods with surging momentum and tireless effort, fully demonstrating our shared hatred and that the spirit of our people is not yet dead. However, the Japanese are cunning and treacherous, with endless tricks. Amidst the resolute anti-Japanese movement of our people, we still fear they may use Western merchants to alter the trademarks and labels of hated goods, transport them to China by roundabout routes, and sell them deceptively. Although Western merchants are deeply aware of the overall situation and may not engage in such practices, preventing problems before they arise is what discerning people hope to hear. If such a thing were to unfortunately happen, it would not only break through our country's barrier against Japanese goods, but also cause Western countries to lose their original credibility in trade with China. Thinking about the future, we cannot help but shudder. Therefore, at the 33rd executive committee meeting of our association on October 16th, it was decided to request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward a message to the consuls of various Western countries stationed in Shanghai, instructing merchants of their respective countries not to engage in altering labels and selling Japanese goods before our country's anti-Japanese movement ends, in order to maintain the original credibility of Western businesses in China, etc. We now follow the resolution and send this letter, respectfully requesting your esteemed Chamber to be wary of the dreadful schemes of the Japanese, uphold the original intention of thorough boycott, and approve the forwarding of a message to the consuls of various Western countries stationed in Shanghai, notifying them accordingly. We would be deeply grateful." The Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied, stating: "We acknowledge receipt of your letter requesting the forwarding of a message to the consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai, urging them not to engage in altering labels and selling Japanese goods before the anti-Japanese movement ends. We have instructed this Chamber to send a letter to the various Western Chambers of Commerce stationed in Shanghai, requesting them to advise their respective merchants to pay attention to avoiding this, so as not to arouse resentment among the Chinese people. Acknowledging receipt of your letter, we hereby reply for your information."</p>
<h3>Confiscation of Yuanlai Arrowroot Powder for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The 3,346 bags of Japanese arrowroot powder from Yuanlai Firm were decided to be confiscated by the sixth executive committee of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and it was also decided by the ninth executive committee to allocate all of them to relieve disaster victims. The careful handling process of this case is now recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Report of the Review Committee</h3>
<p>At the ninth executive committee meeting on October 9th, when discussing the Yuanlai Firm arrowroot powder case, it was publicly decided to appoint nine members to review it. Subsequently, the undersigned were designated as reviewers. Entrusted with this task, we each did our best, personally conducting investigations into the facts, interviewing users, searching for evidence, and inspecting the quality of the powder. We also held meetings on October 12th and 14th. The review resolutions are now recorded below, along with supporting evidence for verification and reference, to aid in a public judgment. (1) Material Evidence: The first collection of Shanghai Special Municipality Anti-Japanese Association Inspection Committee's Work Overview, on the last page, contains a description of "Eastern Powder," quoted as follows: "Eastern powder, commonly known as water chestnut powder, is made from yams, snowy white, smooth, and light lake green, superior to Western powder." (2) Report: Investigating similar goods circulating in the market, there are Japanese goods, Dutch goods, and Shantou goods. Japanese goods are originally called "arrowroot powder," also known as "Eastern powder." Shantou goods are originally called "potato powder." Dutch arrowroot powder is known as "water chestnut powder." Japanese goods are fine and white, Dutch goods are slightly inferior and slightly coarser, and Shantou goods are even worse. The goods from Yuanlai are fine and white in color. (3) Rebuttal: (A) When the Pudong District Inspection Office inspected the goods at Yuanlai, they reviewed the firm's purchase ledger, which stated "Eastern powder," and the Pudong District Inspection Office Director Gu Ruofeng's seal was affixed to the ledger. When the former Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese Committee reviewed it, they wanted to examine the sealed ledger, but Yuanlai refused to hand it over. On what grounds did the firm refuse to hand over the sealed ledger? (B) When the inspectors entered the Yuanlai warehouse to inspect the goods, the firm's personnel were adding "Man and Gun" brand marks to the stored goods. If they were Dutch goods, why add brand marks? (C) The two bills of lading that Yuanlai Firm submitted to the former Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese Committee showed fifty bags on one bill and ten bags on the other, while the inventory was as high as more than three thousand bags. These bills of lading are insufficient as strong evidence. (D) Dutch goods are purchased in a single burlap sack, with a "Double Fish" brand green mark on the sack. The original goods are packed in two burlap sacks. Except for a red straight line printed on one inner sack, there are no other marks, and the structure of the inner sack is denser than that of the Dutch goods. (E) When the Pudong District inspected Yuanlai's inventory, Shao Baoxing rushed to stop them. Shao was a design committee member of the former Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese Committee and had no right to interfere with the inspection. (4) Reasons for the Resolution: The Shanghai Special Municipality Seventeenth Year Anti-Japanese Association's Inspection Committee Work Overview is a printed matter reporting the committee's work from June to October of the same year. Therefore, the undersigned's resolution is based primarily on this, combined with various rebuttals and reports, resulting in the following resolution. (5) Resolution: The goods from Yuanlai are superior to the purchased Dutch goods in all aspects, and the color and powder quality fully comply with the "Eastern Powder" description on the last page of the Shanghai Special Municipality Seventeenth Year Anti-Japanese Association Inspection Committee Work Overview First Collection, which is also consistent with the investigation report. Reviewers: Wang Changyuan, Ren Jinping, Zhang Zilian, Hu Shuhua, Long Peiyun, Lu Muqin, Wang Pingnan.</p>
<h3>Letter to Emergency Relief Associations in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>We respectfully write to inform you that our country has unfortunately suffered from floods, with starving refugees everywhere awaiting relief. Raising funds for disaster relief cannot be delayed. The 3,346 bags of Japanese arrowroot powder seized from Yuanlai Firm have been inspected by our association and confirmed to be Japanese goods. The sixth executive committee decided to confiscate them, and the ninth executive committee decided to allocate all of them for emergency relief. We hereby notify you accordingly, hoping that your esteemed association will investigate and send personnel to receive them for emergency relief and to save the disaster-stricken people. We deeply value your public service. Addressed to the various provincial emergency flood relief associations.</p>
<h3>Economic Severance with Japan Association Begins Registration Today</h3>
<p>Otherwise, Confiscation Upon Discovery</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Economic Severance with Japan Committee, through its first plenary meeting, decided that industrial raw materials imported before the establishment of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association (September 20th) would be allowed to be registered. After a clear investigation, they would be given a deadline to use them up. If they were not registered, they would be confiscated upon discovery. The situation has been repeatedly announced in newspapers. It is now learned that the association has scheduled today to begin issuing registration forms and has notified various trade associations that those with Japanese raw materials in stock that were indeed imported before September 20th can obtain forms from the association and register accordingly.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Association Requests Thorough Investigation of the Truth</h3>
<p>Did Not Prevent Inspection of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The Municipal Cotton Cloth Association, based on a report yesterday that the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association's eleventh standing committee meeting listed a case of the association notifying members to prevent inspection, felt extremely suspicious and sent separate letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association requesting a thorough investigation of the truth. We respectfully write to inform you that upon reading the newspaper report that the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association held its eleventh standing committee meeting yesterday, listing that the Cotton Cloth Trade Association had issued a notice to its members to prevent inspection and asking how to handle the case, and resolving to forward a message to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to ask the association to revoke this notice, we were extremely surprised and puzzled. Our association has not issued such a notice, and we do not know what it is based on. This kind of fabricated slander is clearly intended for other purposes. It concerns the reputation of our association, and we request that you forward a message to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to conduct a fair and thorough investigation to clarify the truth. We hereby send this letter for your review.</p>
<h3>Municipal Joint Association Holds Joint Meeting</h3>
<p>The Special District Citizens' Federation, due to important motions urgently needing discussion, has scheduled a joint meeting of the entire preparatory committee and representatives from various district branches on the 24th of this month (i.e., Saturday) at 10:00 AM.

Each district branch should send three representatives to attend.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Work in Various Sectors</h3>
<p>Lawyers' Association Holds Four Group Meeting The Shanghai Lawyers' Association held a joint meeting of the four anti-Japanese national salvation committee groups last night at 8:00 PM. Over fifty committee members, including Liu Zuwang, attended. Lu Shaozong was publicly elected as chairman, and Dai Jixian recorded the proceedings as usual. The chairman reported on the recent anti-Japanese work situation, and the military group's national salvation corps volunteer registration numbers were completed. Yu Zhongluo, Qiu Fenling, Mao Yun, Shi Liang, Shan Yuhua, Lu Jianai, and others then gave speeches on national salvation ideas. After lengthy discussion, the following methods were decided: (1) Appoint responsible conveners for each group, appointed on the spot: (A) Urging the government to express its policy towards Japan group, Liu Zuwang was recommended. (B) Economic severance group, Lu Jianai and Dai Jinghuai were recommended. (C) Military group, Wu Shou Gong was recommended. (D) Propaganda and speech group, Liu Shifang and Qiu Fenling were recommended. (2) For propaganda and speeches, personnel responsible should be appointed quickly. It was decided to notify all members of the association to each draft a propaganda article, and to also ask representatives to contact enthusiastic members to take on speaking duties. (3) It was decided to notify members who are professors at various universities to do their utmost to publicize and speak about the barbarity of the Japanese in their respective locations. (4) It was decided to convene a military group committee on Monday. (5) Regarding the method of sending personnel to give speeches in public places, it was decided to first send personnel from the association to make contact. Other suggestions were handled separately by each group. The meeting adjourned late at night.</p>
<h3>Second Swearing-In Ceremony for the Two-Road District Party's Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Two-Road District Party's National Salvation Volunteer Army has been training for two weeks, with no less than a hundred people joining one after another. Yesterday, more than fifty workers from the Wusong Machine Factory came to the department at 4:00 PM to hold a swearing-in ceremony. Tan Chansheng, chairman of the general affairs section of the executive committee, presided over the meeting as usual, and reported on the significance and mission of the national salvation volunteer army and the importance of the oath. The oath-taking ceremony was then held separately. As it was late, Jin Jianong, the training officer of the department, led them to the training ground to line up. Chen Pin, a member of the executive committee, and Zhang Yunhe, a member of the disciplinary committee, gave speeches one after another, all of which were passionate and inspiring. They returned to the auditorium, elected the captains and deputy captains of the two teams, discussed proposals, and adjourned the meeting, which was already past 8:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Inspection Work of the Seventeenth District Branch of the Municipal Citizens' Federation</h3>
<p>The Seventeenth District Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Federation convened over a thousand members of the Japanese goods inspection committee and specialists yesterday, divided into groups for household inspections. "Group A": Jiang Xianhe, Fang Huijian, Shu Wenyao, Chen Jiufeng, Tan Yuchang, Gao Jieyuan, Wu Shaorong, Pan Bingchen. "Group B": Wu Youqing, Chen Minglai, Li Fuxiang, Liu Yingru, Wang Chengzhai, Wang Hucheng, Qian Yishan, etc., departed for inspections at the same time. All stores welcomed the inspections.

<h3>Establishment of the China Seafarers' National Salvation League</h3>
<p>Chinese sailors have always had patriotic fervor. This time, the violent Japanese occupation of the three eastern provinces has filled all sailors with righteous indignation and deep hatred. They have convened comrades from various regions, held a meeting, and publicly requested Zhang Fan, Wang Rui, Zhou E, Yang Fugui, and others to organize the China Seafarers' National Salvation League to unite and carry out the work of resisting Japan and saving the country. The organization has now been established and has been formally founded.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Anti-Japanese Association of Chinese Employees in Foreign Firms</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Chinese Employees in Foreign Firms convened a general assembly on the 3rd of this month. In addition to passing all anti-Japanese work, it issued a declaration, excerpts of which are as follows: (omitted above) "We, the undersigned, grieve at the impending national crisis, worry about the loss of the mainland, and are filled with hatred and pain, wishing we could die. Driven by the enthusiasm to save the country, and learning from the past, we are willing to be pioneers, go to the national crisis together, and eliminate this violent enemy to avenge the national humiliation. Chinese employees in foreign firms have traditionally lacked organizations. Gu Yanwu said, 'The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every person.' What day is it now? It is a time of crisis for the survival of China. If we do not rise together and unite, then we, the Chinese employees, will not be able to embark on national crisis and resist the violent Japanese. Therefore, on October 3rd, we convened Chinese employees in foreign firms in Shanghai to organize the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. Since its establishment, many have joined, demonstrating the extreme indignation of our people. If we do not seize this opportunity to expand publicity outward, we fear that various countries will be misled and manipulated by the violent enemy. This is something that the Chinese people must strive to address quickly, and it is also the greatest responsibility of this association. We dare to declare our modest sincerity to the people of the country."</p>

<h3>South China Shipping Route Resumes Amidst Peace</h3>
<p>Guangdong Lifts Ban on Shipping</p>
<p>Chinese Ships Plan to Resume Service</p>
<p>In April of this year, the Guangdong authorities blockaded the ports of Shantou and Guangzhou due to military considerations. Shanghai-bound ships to South China had to use waterway pilots assigned by the government, so Chinese merchant ships temporarily suspended the South China shipping route. This has been the case for half a year. Recently, peaceful unification has been successful, and the South China shipping route has also been unblocked. The local Chinese merchant ships are preparing to resume operations. What we have heard is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Removal of Sea Mines</h3>
<p>From May 1st of this year, the Guangzhou authorities laid four lines of sea mines in the port of Shantou and notified various shipping companies that all merchant ships arriving in Shantou had to be led by a small steamer specially dispatched by Guangdong before entering the port. Now, because peace has begun, Shantou has no need for defense, and the Guangdong authorities have removed the laid mines. All ships sailing from Shanghai can freely enter the port without a pilot boat.</p>
<h3>Lifting of the Ban</h3>
<p>Since May 11th, Shantou had issued a ban on night navigation, requiring merchant ships entering and leaving the port to travel to and from the port within a specified time. Now the night navigation ban has also been abolished, restoring the situation before April, and ships traveling to and from Shantou no longer need to be inspected. However, Japanese ships have not been allowed to enter the port since the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Suspension of Chinese Ships</h3>
<p>For the Shanghai-South China liner service to Shantou and Guangdong, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company dispatched four ships, Guangda, Guangli, Yu'an, and Taishun. Since May, due to the blockade of the ports of Shantou and Guangdong, these services have been suspended for half a year. The rented ship Yu'an only travels to Xiamen and Hong Kong. Guangli has been transferred to Fuzhou, and Guangda has been dismantled. Yu'an and Taishun have been rerouted to the Yangtze River and North China. The South China shipping route has been suspended for a long time. Since the boycott of Japanese ships, the excellent business opportunity has been monopolized by British ships, which is a pity.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Resume Operations</h3>
<p>The Shantou shipping ban has been lifted, and Chinese ships can operate in Guangdong. Now, with the congestion of export goods, the Shantou and Guangdong communities have sent telegrams to various shipping companies in Shanghai, requesting them to quickly dispatch Chinese ships to resume the Shanghai-Shantou-Guangdong route to meet the needs of the Chinese people. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has decided to resume the long-suspended South China liner service, but there are no ships available for temporary allocation. It has requested headquarters to first return the Yu'an to Shanghai for operation on the Shantou and Guangdong routes. The company is also adding two seagoing vessels to increase service on the route. The shipping department is actively working on this, and service should resume soon.</p>
<h3>British Ships Handling Congested Cargo</h3>
<p>During this boycott of Japanese goods, the Chinese people are thoroughly implementing it. Japanese ships on the Shanghai-Nanyang route have completely no cargo to load. In the past two months, the Taikoo and Jardine's Shantou-Xiamen-Guangdong liner services have broken all previous records in terms of export cargo, with each ship averaging over thirty thousand taels in freight and passenger revenue. Recently, the cargo going to Shantou and Guangdong has become even more congested, and all dimensions and weights must be fully charged. Therefore, Hakka people are eagerly awaiting the resumption of Chinese ships.</p>
<h3>Various University Anti-Japanese Associations Telegraphically Request Protection of Compatriots Fleeing from the Northeast</h3>
<p>And Strictly Investigate Shantou Merchants</p>
<p>The various university anti-Japanese national salvation associations in this city recently heard that the Northeast Railway Bureau refused to allow compatriots fleeing without being able to purchase tickets, and telegraphed Deputy Commander Zhang to protect them and crack down on this type of situation. Also, because Shantou merchants are privately importing enemy goods, they telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Shantou Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, requesting a strict investigation and legal action. The telegrams will be sent immediately. The original telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to Deputy Commander Zhang: To Deputy Commander Zhang in Beiping, we have heard that refugees from the Northeast have reported that the Northeast Railway Vehicle Office often expels compatriots fleeing without being able to purchase tickets from the train, endangering their lives. We urge you to promptly order the Northeast Railway Vehicle Office to protect the fleeing compatriots and prevent such incidents from happening again. To save our Northeast compatriots, we urgently request your assistance.</p>
<p>Letter to the Guangdong Party Headquarters and Government: To the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters and Provincial Government, the violent Japanese are invading our territory and killing our officials and people. Every citizen should be filled with righteous indignation. At this time of national crisis, all should work together to resist Japan and save the country as a backing for the government. We have recently received reports from various sources that many unscrupulous merchants in Shantou are daring to undermine anti-Japanese work by privately importing enemy goods and refusing inspections. We request that they be severely punished to maintain discipline, appease public anger, and deter others. This would be fortunate for the anti-Japanese work and for the future of the Party and the country. We urgently request your assistance.</p>
<p>Letter to the Shantou Anti-Japanese Association: To the Shantou Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, we have recently received reports from various sources that many unscrupulous merchants in your area are daring to undermine anti-Japanese work by privately importing enemy goods. We are filled with grief and indignation upon hearing this. In addition to telegraphing the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government to request a strict investigation and punishment, we specifically telegram you, hoping that all of our anti-Japanese comrades will uphold the fearless spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen to eliminate all reactionary elements in order to achieve the ultimate goal of resisting Japan and saving the country. We, the students of Shanghai, pledge to be your backing.</p>
<h3>Completely Domestic Printed and Dyed Cotton Fabric</h3>
<p>A Product of the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company</p>
<p>The clothing of women and children in the lower and middle classes of our country has traditionally favored bright colors, and the raw materials for this are mostly produced in the Japanese archipelago, generally referred to as "Eastern goods." This type of fabric not only fills the markets of major cities but also penetrates remote areas like mercury seeping into the ground. The amount of money leaking out each year is incalculable. Chinese people only know to be greedy for ready-made goods and do not know how to remedy the situation, allowing a trickle to turn into a river. In fact, our country has also been imitating the production of this type of fabric in recent years. For example, the various printed and dyed cotton fabrics produced by the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company at No. 1382 Gaolang Bridge, Huade Road, this city, can not only be used to replace the so-called "Eastern goods" but are also more colorful and durable than "Eastern goods." The company uses printed and dyed cotton fabrics as its business and is entirely a Chinese enterprise that gathers Chinese capital. Since its founding last year, its products have included printed cloth, printed soft pulp cloth, various plain dyed silks, and printed twill, dyed twill, printed serge, dyed serge, printed straight warp twill, and dyed straight warp twill. All types of gray fabric are woven by the two Shanghai textile factories, Shenxin and Xinhua. The company and the two factories have long-term supply contracts. The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has repeatedly sent personnel to the factory and the two factories, Shenxin and Xinhua, for detailed inspections and verified that they are completely domestic goods. The Shanghai Municipal Anti-Japanese National Salvation Executive Committee also sent a letter to the company to prove this, stating, "This association, for the sake of protecting domestic goods, will not make things difficult and should allow passage." Since the company is operated by Chinese capital, and its products are supervised by Chinese technicians and made with Chinese raw materials, it is extremely compliant with legal rules. It is unnecessary for Chinese people to seek foreign goods again and use enemy goods.</p>
<h3>Overseas Representatives Attending the Fourth Plenary Session Arrive in Shanghai One After Another</h3>

<h3>Ruling on Working Hours in the Letterpress Printing Industry</h3>
<p>To Be Changed to Eight Hours and Forty-Five Minutes</p>
<p>From January 1, Year 21</p>
<p>Workers in the letterpress printing industry in this city automatically implemented eight-hour workdays on August 1 due to treatment and conditions, causing the entire industry to declare a shutdown. The Bureau of Social Affairs ordered the original state to be temporarily maintained pending resolution. After repeated mediation, the issue of working hours could not be resolved. It was inevitable to submit it to arbitration. The municipal government, in the midst of national affairs and diplomatic tensions, believed that labor and management should cooperate in the spirit of cooperation to seek development. The specific arbitration methods are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Municipal Arbitration</h3>
<p>Labor and management on the treatment conditions have particularly strong disputes, which is considered the focus. After the Conciliation Committee of the Bureau of Social Affairs declared the conciliation unsuccessful, the issue of working hours was submitted to arbitration. The municipal government approved the arbitration and convened the arbitration committee. Guo Shen, the chairman of the committee from the municipal government, committee members Tong Xingbai from the municipal party headquarters, Xiong Fei from the local court, Zhu Xuefan from all the city's labor circles, Lao Jingxiu from the city's capitalists, and clerk Chen Tian, after repeated discussions, decided on the methods.</p>
<h3>Decided Methods</h3>
<p>The arbitration committee's decision is as follows: (Principal Text) The daily working hours for day laborers are eight hours and forty-five minutes, to be implemented from January 1, 1932. The current daily work hours will remain at nine hours. (Reasons) The original treatment conditions between labor and management stipulated nine working hours per day. The labor side requested a reduction in working hours to eight hours, as stipulated in the Factory Law, as a principle. After mediation failed, arbitration was requested. After the committee summoned both parties for questioning, the capitalist representatives Dai Zhonglin and Guo Shaoyi replied that the working hours in the letterpress printing industry were very long before 1928. Since the labor-management agreement of nine working hours was agreed upon, production capacity has inevitably decreased. The labor side's request for a raise and improvement of other treatments has been reluctantly agreed to. Regarding the working hours, it is not only impossible to reduce them but requested to allow them to be extended to ten hours, so as to increase production and reduce the burden, etc. The labor representatives Wang Xingquan and Liang Huangling replied that the work done by letterpress printing workers is very laborious, not only physically but also mentally. Overly long working hours not only hinder the workers' health but also easily cause sluggishness in work and poor production, which is not beneficial to the capitalist's business. They requested that the decision be made to allow eight hours of work. After the committee reviewed the original conciliation documents and examined the statements made by both representatives, the capital size of each factory in the industry is different, the equipment is not neat, and the management is not perfect. Moreover, few of the letterpress printing firms in the city have joined the labor-management groups in this case, and working hours have not been consistent. As with the labor master's request, the capitalist in this case must suffer from the competition of the same industry, and it is also detrimental to the labor side. However, the work of the workers in the industry is indeed laborious and mentally demanding. It is not impossible to slightly reduce working hours to show adjustment and consideration. However, in this time of national affairs and diplomatic tensions, labor and management should cooperate in the spirit of cooperation to seek the development of enterprises. It was decided that the working hours of eight hours and forty-five minutes per day should wait until next New Year's Day to begin implementation. A special ruling is made as in the main text.</p>

<h3>Machine Explosion at Da Xin Chang Injures People</h3>
<p>Machine explosion due to excessive steam</p>
<p>Cylinder ejection causes major accident</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a machine suddenly exploded at the Da Xin Chang Refining Factory on Route Paul Beau in the French Concession, injuring many people. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Large Scale</h3>
<p>Located at No. 90 Route Mearns in the French Concession is the Da Xin Chang Dyeing and Finishing Company, which includes the Hua De Xin Dyeing Factory. The factory is very large, occupying more than 20 mu of land, and is reportedly organized by wealthy merchants from Shaoxing. It employs over 100 workers.</p>
<h3>Seven Machines</h3>
<p>In the southern part of the Da Xin Factory is a large boiler and seven finishing machines. Each machine has two cylindrical rollers that can rotate up and down. After the preliminary refining process, the fabric is ironed smooth by these machines and then packaged for sale. The structure of this machinery is rarely seen by the average person.</p>
<h3>Sudden Explosion</h3>
<p>Each of these machines is operated by two workers. At about 2 p.m. yesterday, one of the machines exploded due to excessive steam because the operator forgot to release the pressure. The sound was like thunder, and the cylinder flew out of the machine, penetrating two walls on the east side and injuring six workers.</p>
<h3>Six Injured</h3>
<p>The six injured workers are Ding Aliang, Song Zhengrong, Pan Yuqing, Zhou Yuejin, Wu Caisheng, and Ren Baosheng. After learning of the incident, the police from the Route Tenant de la Tour patrol station sent detectives to the Hec Road Red Cross Hospital to treat the injured and investigate the cause of the accident. It is reported that two of the six injured workers are in critical condition and may not survive.</p>
<h3>Detectives Inspecting Pedestrians Shoot at Bandits, Causing Casualties</h3>
<p>Chinese Detective Shi Huanwen Wounded in Both Wrists</p>
<p>Pedestrian Dies in Hospital from Serious Injuries</p>
<p>Five Chinese and foreign detectives from the Wayside Road police station in Tilanqiao were inspecting pedestrians around Xinji Bang Road at around 6:15 p.m. yesterday. Near Ronghua Lane at the intersection of Tangshan Road, they noticed several people standing by the roadside who seemed suspicious. The detectives immediately approached them, questioned them, and began to search them. However, the bandits became aware of the situation and opened fire, refusing to be searched. The detectives returned fire. The bandits fired as they fled, wounding Chinese detective Shi Huanting of No. 271 in the right wrist. In addition, stray bullets hit three passersby: Yan Fusheng, 35 years old, from Ningbo, who runs the Meida Cigarette Factory on East Agreen Road, was shot in the abdomen; Ye Songmao, 10 years old, son of the owner of the Shun Kang distillery at No. 130 Xinji Bang Road, was shot through the right leg; and Wu Ruixiang, from Chongming, 20 years old, a servant at the Xiao residence at No. 141 Tangshan Road, was hit in the chest by a stray bullet while out buying eggs. All were taken to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, but the last victim died in the hospital shortly after due to the severity of his injuries.</p>
<h3>Remnants of Tai Bao Ashu's Gang</h3>
<p>Water Police Detectives Come to Shanghai to Arrest</p>
<p>One Bandit Escapes, One Awaits Transfer</p>
<p>Detective Illegally Detains, Fined</p>
<p>Since the execution of Taihu bandit leader Tai Bao Ashu (aka Xu Tianxiong), countless members of his gang have fled to various ports. Some time ago, Wang Yulin, a detective from the Jiangsu Water Police Bureau in Qingpu, received information from an informant that a follower of Xu named Agen, from Songjiang, was hiding with his fellow villager Zhou Xirong, a peddler, at No. 33 Agreen Road. On the 21st, Wang arrived in Shanghai from Minhang with an arrest warrant for Agen issued by the local authorities. Wang secretly went to the address and arrested Agen, who confessed that Song Huyu, aka Xiaodi, Xu’s 18-year-old adopted son from Songjiang, was working as a cook at a boarding house on Great Western Road. Wang and the detective went to the boarding house and arrested Song. However, Agen escaped in the confusion. Wang then took Song Huyu to Room 6 of the Shanghai Hotel at No. 67 Baoyu Lane in the French Concession, hired someone to guard him, and at about 3 p.m., returned to No. 33 Agreen Road and took Zhou Xirong to the hotel, accusing him of harboring Agen and threatening him. Zhou was detained and not allowed to leave. Zhou’s partner, Gu Xiuqing, learned of this and told her friend, Xu Jundao, the owner of the Broadway Road Wayside Hotel, who went to Room 6 of the Shanghai Hotel in the French Concession to plead with Wang to release Zhou Xirong. Wang demanded a guarantee, and Xu provided a card with a brief guarantee and paid the hotel fee of $13 before Zhou was released at about 9 p.m. The next morning, Zhou reported the matter to the Hongkou police station, and Chinese Detective Chief Zhao Bingkun, Chinese Detectives Li Xunwu and Zhao Lianbi, and Western Detective Clayton went to the Shanghai Hotel in the French Concession to arrest Wang Yulin, confiscating a pair of handcuffs and the arrest warrant for Agen. They also arrested the suspects: Cha Heqing from Changshu, Tang Shiming from Ningbo, and Zhou Peifang from Shanghai, and Song Huyu, and took them back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, presented the case, stating that the police station was accusing Wang and the other four of crimes of obstructing freedom and intimidation, and requested punishment. Song Huyu admitted at the police station that he was a follower of Tai Bao Ashu and had been shot twice in the back while helping to commit a crime. The court was requested to interrogate him and notify the local Public Security Bureau to formally request his extradition. According to the Chinese and Western detectives, the circumstances of the arrest of each defendant were presented, and the handcuffs and arrest warrant were submitted for inspection. The victim, Zhou Xirong, stated that he ran a rice cake stall on Agreen Road and that Agen was staying at his place and helping out. He had been introduced to Agen but did not know what Agen had done. He described the situation and said that Detective Wang had said that he should not have hired Agen, a wanted criminal. After investigating the source, his friend Xu Jun bailed him out. Xu Jundao and Gu Xiuqing also testified. Wang Yulin claimed that Agen had escaped midway and that he wanted to use Agen as an informant to solve other cases, so he had asked Zhou Xirong to talk in Room 6 of the Shanghai Hotel, which he owned in the French Concession, to ask who had introduced Agen and denied illegally detaining him. The $13 hotel fee was paid politely by Xu Jundao. If Agen was arrested in the future, he would still need Zhou to testify. He asked if he had a guarantor and had no other intentions. The three defendants, Cha, Tang, and Zhou, were all friends who had gone to the hotel to visit Wang Yulin and had been mistakenly arrested. Song Huyu claimed that he had been farming in his hometown and had been forced by Tai Bao Ashu to work as a boatman. When he refused, he was shot. He had two gunshot wounds on his back from the bandits. His other testimony was evasive. After Judge Xiao Xie fen reviewed the testimonies, he sentenced Wang Yulin to a fine of $30, Cha Heqing, Tang Shiming, and Zhou Peifang were found not guilty, and Song Huyu was temporarily detained and transferred to the Jiangsu Water Police Bureau First District for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief News</h3>
<p>American Church Donates More Than 200,000 The Shanghai Christian Association, in view of the severe flooding in the country, has published advertisements to raise funds for disaster relief, as reported in this newspaper. It has been learned that the association has received donations from enthusiastic believers both domestically and internationally, amounting to more than 32,000 yuan as of yesterday. More donations are being sent from various places. Yesterday, the association received a telegram from the American Church Relief Committee stating that it had raised 50,000 US dollars and would remit 10,000 US dollars each week for the next five weeks. At the current exchange rate, 50,000 US dollars is equivalent to more than 200,000 yuan in national currency. The association will use specialized committees to devise relief efforts after receiving the funds.</p>
<h3>News from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association</h3>
<p>"The Misguided Plan to Open Sluices and Block Rivers" The association has recently heard rumors that river engineering authorities are considering opening sluices and blocking rivers. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to Chairman Ye of the Jiangbei Canal Rehabilitation Engineering Committee and Director Shen of the Jiangsu Construction Department to clarify the truth. The original telegram is excerpted below: (Above omitted) The breaching of Gao Shao and the blocking of the river cannot be delayed. However, we have heard rumors that river engineering authorities intend to open all the sluice gates along the canal to lower the water level and make it easier to block the river. This is very alarming. The purpose of blocking the river is to reduce flooding in the lower reaches so that the disaster victims can live in peace and to maintain the water flow for the canal to prevent drought in the spring. Opening the sluices to release water would only cause the water to flow more rapidly into the lower reaches, causing even greater flooding, which is contrary to the original intention of blocking the river. (Your committee members have repeatedly surveyed the situation and are familiar with it, and your director is a water conservancy expert and has conducted research. It is unlikely that you would promote such a plan. We ask for a clear explanation to dispel the doubts.) The members of our association believe that to reduce the flow of the canal, the only way is to block the Sanhe Dam and reduce the water flow from the upper reaches, so that the water in the lower reaches of the canal will naturally become shallower, making it easier to start construction. We hope for your response. (Below omitted) "Relieving the Motherland from the Flood Disaster" Xie Fuchu, chairman of the Beiping Overseas Chinese Industrial Advancement Association, yesterday sent a telegram to all Chinese Chambers of Commerce overseas, asking them to quickly raise funds and send food and clothing back to the country to relieve the flood disaster.</p>
<h3>Pacific Society Day Three</h3>
<p>Round Table Discusses Industrialization</p>
<p>Nine-Nation Committee Tours Hangzhou Today</p>
<p>Shen Shi Telegraph News Agency reports that the Pacific International Society held its third day of meetings yesterday. The round table conference continued to discuss the "Economic Development of China" in the morning, divided into four groups. The first group was chaired by Tao Menghe, the second by Nedu, the third by Hunter, and the fourth by Rockhill. The meeting adjourned at 10:15 a.m. and resumed at 11:15 a.m. with a joint discussion of all groups, chaired by Hu Shi. Liu Jingshan lectured on "Transportation Issues," and He Lian lectured on "Industrialization Issues." At 12:15 p.m., the program committee and the chairman and secretaries held a joint meeting. At 12:30 p.m., the Chinese committee hosted a banquet for all committee members. In the afternoon at 2:00 p.m., the American committee held a meeting. From 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., the Chinese committee hosted a tea dance for all committee members. From 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., Mr. Rockhill lectured on "China's Population Issues." The discussions, lectures, and other news are excerpted below.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Industrialization</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of discussion on China's economic development, focusing on industrialization, with particular attention to small-scale industries in rural areas. Chinese farmers are partly dependent on the weather and partly dependent on farming for their livelihood. It is possible to utilize the surplus agricultural labor to engage in rural industries to increase income. The average annual income of Chinese farmers is about 20 yuan, while factory workers can earn about 15 yuan per month. This type of industry has gradually developed, but it is hindered by the lack of credit organizations, specialized technology, markets, and other social amenities needed for various industries, such as convenient transportation and low tax rates.</p>
<p>Committee members familiar with the development of rural industries in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and Japan reported on the situation. In the Philippines, industries such as hemp weaving and embroidery bamboo weaving have developed significantly. In Japan, small-scale cooperative silk factories have outperformed their well-funded counterparts in the past decade. In China, industries such as grass hats, lace embroidery, etc., have also emerged, and in some places, the cotton and wool fabrics produced by farmers in their spare time are inexpensive and can compete with machine-made products from the cities.</p>
<p>The social impact of industrialization in China was discussed in detail. Due to the lack of iron, coal, and oil in the Pacific region, the development of large industries is often hindered. The most promising areas for development are handicrafts and other industries that can utilize existing raw materials or those produced domestically. All small industries should gradually expand from existing ones and develop new industries that utilize manual skills, which is more beneficial than investing in machines because handicrafts are easier to market. The expansion of this type of craft benefits greatly from railway transportation, but transportation alone is not enough. It is necessary to have good rural banks and establish better production and distribution cooperatives. However, there is one thing that the organization of rural industries lacks compared to the organization of capital factories: factory organizations can innovate and manipulate the market, while unorganized rural handicrafts cannot. The styles of handicrafts often remain unchanged, making them unsuitable for the times.</p>
<p>Cooperation among farmers for lending and sales is just beginning in China, while it has made great progress in Japan. Some of these methods may be applicable to the situation in China. When discussing whether this method can increase production, some people questioned whether it is appropriate to increase production during this period of overproduction. Although European and American countries have solved the problem of production, they are struggling with the problem of distribution. Others argued that China's production is not yet sufficient to meet its own needs, so it should still focus on production. Some also said that since countries around the world are already dealing with the problem of distribution, China should also prepare for it and reform its land leasing and farming methods. A representative said that land ownership in China changes every 30 years because the customs of the country, such as weddings and funerals, cost a lot, and farmers rarely have savings, so they mortgage and borrow to cope. With the exploitation of heavy interest, they never have the hope of redeeming it, so their ownership is often transferred from generation to generation. In addition, some representatives proposed whether China should adopt the Russian method of collective farming and completely abolish private ownership of farmland when discussing farming issues. Because this point is difficult to implement in China, it can only choose one of the following two options: increase cooperation among farmers, approaching conservative Guild Socialism, or continue with capitalist economicism and gradually improve to reform the existing ills of Chinese agriculture.</p>
<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of industrialization in China? This question was also discussed. A labor representative said that the impact of the machine age in Europe and the United States has led to a gradual decrease in the number of people with high salaries in the country, while the number of unemployed people is increasing. However, some argued that even if we all agree that industrialization is detrimental to China, it is inevitable. The only way to remedy this is to accept it and guide it through constructive methods so that it is beneficial and harmless to society, and to seek the development of individual small handicrafts to compete with urban factories, either by producing the same products at lower prices or by producing items that are not suitable for machines.</p>
<h3>Road Transportation Issues</h3>
<p>Mr. Liu Jingshan lectured on China's road transportation, briefly describing the development of provincial and national roads in China. 35,000 miles of provincial roads have been built, and national roads are still mostly in the planning stage. Some of the 35,000 miles of provincial roads are ancient post roads, but most are newly built and are just dirt roads without paved surfaces, but a small portion, especially those near cities, are paved with gravel. National roads are all paved. Most of the roads were built by hand within two years, with limited use of machinery. Near cities, every time a new road is opened, cars and rickshaws fill the road, without any organization, leading to mutual losses. In fact, proper management of each would be very beneficial for both freight and passenger transport. For freight vehicles, those that are inexpensive and travel slowly can be used on poor roads, such as a Fordson tractor with several trailers, traveling at 10 miles per hour, which is still two or three times faster than a horse-drawn carriage. All national roads have hard surfaces, and the construction cost is 364 million yuan, with 170 million yuan to be spent separately in the next ten years. Because there are not enough supervising engineers for road construction, it is planned to send young engineers to the United States to study and hire foreign experts to come to China to set up classes in engineering schools to teach. This matter will be handled by the director of the Ministry of Railways, who will use the land tax collected along the roads and the car tax as a fund, and it is also planned to allocate a portion of the customs duties levied on automobile oil, automobiles, and automobile accessories for this purpose.</p>
<h3>Industrialization of China</h3>
<p>Mr. He Lian lectured on the industrialization of China, briefly stating that China's industry is very underdeveloped. Although its population accounts for a quarter of the world's total, its coal production accounts for only 1.6% of the world's total. The cotton weaving industry is the most developed industry in the country, but its number of spindles accounts for only 2% of the world's total. This industry is concentrated in six provinces, which account for 10% of the country's area and 30% of the country's population. The development of China's industry is greatly hindered by the lack of capital and lending facilities. Chinese yarn factories account for 37% of the country's spindles, but their invested capital accounts for only 28%. Japanese yarn factories account for 39% of the country's spindles, but their capital accounts for 70%. Therefore, the average capital per spindle in Chinese factories is only 39 yuan, while in Japanese factories it reaches 137 yuan. As a result, Chinese yarn factories have almost no working capital, and lending facilities are limited, and their interest rates are extremely high. As for management, there is also room for improvement. The benefits on the balance sheet are often not included in the depreciation item, and in years of business prosperity, the entire profit is often distributed as dividends without knowing how to make reserves. Political instability and inconvenient transportation are also reasons that hinder the development of industry. In addition, taxes are heavy. Before the abolition of likin, the taxes paid along the way for wool transported to Tianjin were ten times its original value. Domestic industry is still relatively cheap. Adult textile workers in Shanghai can earn 40 cents to 1.4 yuan per day, or an average of 15 or 16 yuan per month. There are also many women and children working. The new factory law has now been promulgated, but in order for it to be effectively implemented, the contractor system must first be abolished, and there must be workers' organizations to protect their own interests, but they must pay a considerable price. China's development is greatly limited by the lack of basic raw materials for large-scale industry, such as coal, iron, and oil. Therefore, it should investigate the raw materials produced and can be produced in China, and the industries that rely on these raw materials, and some should implement protective tariffs. The development of home and handicraft industries is also a major factor, but there must be better lending systems and sales facilities, etc.</p>
<h3>Departing for Hangzhou Today</h3>
<p>About 100 representatives from nine countries will take the express train to Hangzhou at 3 p.m. today, staying at the West Lake Hotel and the Xin Xin Hotel. In the evening, the Governor of Zhejiang Province, Gao Zhangnanxian, and the Mayor of Hangzhou, Zhao Zhiyou, will host a banquet to welcome them. Tomorrow morning, they will tour the scenic spots on the lake, and in the afternoon at 6 p.m., they will take a special train back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Students Mistakenly Destroy Du Villa Case</h3>
<p>Compensation of 1,000 Yuan and Public Apology</p>
<p>Mr. Du Understands and Does Not Want to Pursue the Matter</p>
<p>The Cihui Hall on the West Lake Bridge in Hangzhou is a villa recently purchased by Shanghai gentleman Du Yuesheng. Hangzhou people did not know the background and mistakenly thought it was Wang Villa. On the 29th of last month, students from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Zhejiang Provincial Senior High School participated in an anti-Japanese national salvation parade. After hearing reports that a certain minister was admiring the moon there, they were outraged and immediately marched to the Cihui Hall and destroyed it, damaging all the furniture and utensils in the room. Later, after various parties proved that the Cihui Hall was not Wang Villa and that a certain minister had never admired the moon there, it was a misunderstanding. The principal of the school, Ye Suzhong, not only resigned to the Ministry of Education, but also came to Shanghai to apologize to Mr. Du. Zhang Nanxian, the Governor of Zhejiang Province, Zhao Zhiyou, the Mayor of Hangzhou, He Yun, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, and Wang Zhaizhu, Wang Xiangquan, and Jin Runquan, etc., of the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce also wrote letters to Mr. Du to express their condolences and apologize. Zhang Daofan, the Director of the Ministry of Education, also came to Shanghai in person to explain the misunderstanding to Mr. Du and ordered the school to compensate for the loss of 1,000 yuan and publish an apology in the Shanghai newspapers, which has now been fully implemented. Mr. Du said that although the loss was huge, he considered that the students' patriotic actions were out of a moment of righteous indignation, so he agreed not to pursue the matter further.</p>
<h3>Head of the Defense Corps Weeps Bitterly</h3>
<p>Regrets Resisting the French Police</p>
<p>But How Can the Law Bend the Rules?</p>
<p>Luo Weiren, the head of the Longwangmiao Defense Corps in Pudong, was arrested for helping the murderer Fu Meisheng resist the arrest of the local court. The chief prosecutor sent Police Chief Xu Jinqing to supervise the police to arrest Luo, as reported yesterday. It is learned that Luo was arrested the night before, and the defense corps sent Fu Meisheng to the court yesterday. Prosecutor Wang opened a trial and questioned Luo, who admitted that he had made a mistake in seizing the prisoner and bribing the defendant. He was uneducated and did not know the law, and asked the judge for forgiveness, even weeping bitterly and regretting it repeatedly. The judge found that the defense corps had interfered with the court police and had the same incident in 1928, and even wanted to tie up the court police, and had been punished. Therefore, he lectured him, saying, "You are incorrigible. The judge can forgive you, but the law cannot forgive you." Then he questioned Fu Meisheng and ordered them to be detained together, pending punishment according to law.</p>
<h3>Domestic Agricultural Machines Are Effective, Inexpensive</h3>
<p>The Chinese New Agricultural Implements Promotion Center at the intersection of Route Cardinal Mercier and Route Hua Long in the French Concession and the branch at the Dali Wharf near Guanguan Bridge on the Bund in the South City are established by the Chinese Vocational Education Society. Although it has only been two years, its products are exquisite, efficient, and inexpensive, and it guarantees use and provides thoughtful service. It is also purely domestic, so it is trusted by farmers. In the first half of this year, the promotion value reached more than 50,000 yuan. Recently, it has invented a diamond emery rice huller. Using the center's 3-horsepower engine to drive it, it can produce 3,000 pounds of brown rice per hour. Its efficiency even exceeds the Japanese Yangpi rice huller, which was popular for a while, by more than ten times. Recently, orders have been pouring in. Other products, such as the foot-operated cotton gin, which produces 10 pounds of loose cotton per hour, the small rice mill, which uses 3 horsepower to drive it and produces 3 shi of white rice per hour, the foot-operated rice threshing machine, which threshes 6 mu of rice per day, the 26-hour cotton gin, which produces 15 pounds of cotton per hour, the 3-horsepower small engine, which uses 25 taels of oil per hour, and the hand-cranked corn sheller, which produces 600 pounds of corn per hour, are all very effective and inexpensive. The promotion results are very impressive, and it is also good news amid the boycott of Japanese goods.</p>

<h3>Reader Correspondence</h3>
<p>The reader correspondence column of this newspaper has always been limited to three issues: education, occupation, and marriage. Since the occurrence of the Japanese invasion of Northeast China, dozens of letters have come in every day discussing how to solve the Northeast issue and how to deal with Japan's atrocities. This is a manifestation of the compatriots' fervent patriotism, which we deeply admire. Now, we make an agreement with you: Since you have temporarily set aside personal issues such as education, occupation, and marriage, and are eager to study methods of saving the country, please express your opinions on the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) What kind of propositions should our country adopt towards the League of Nations in order to be the most suitable?</p>
<p>(2) What are the truly effective ways to boycott Japanese goods? (It can be said specifically for one industry or one place.)</p>
<p>(3) How can the training of volunteers be promoted? How can it be sustained?</p>
<p>(4) How can the people of the whole country be united to face foreign enemies?</p>
<p>Each answer should be limited to a maximum of one thousand words. Say less empty words and propose specific methods. This newspaper will select and disclose the best ones according to the capacity of this column for public discussion. If you agree with the methods proposed by others, please also state it. Please still disclose your name, gender, age, occupation, or place of study, place of origin, and attach communication stamps and a sufficient number of stamps. Those who are not published in the newspaper will be notified by letter. As for the three issues of education, occupation, and marriage, they will still be handled in accordance with the previous regulations. Respectfully,</p>
<p>News from Li Dajun, a farmer in Taixian (omitted)</p>
<p>(Asked how to teach people to enjoy listening to propaganda)</p>
<p>(Reply) To promote propaganda against buying Japanese goods, gather a number of like-minded people and start with yourself. On the one hand, persuade others; on the other hand, set an example yourself. It must also be sustained in order to be effective. For everything, the degree of a person's ability and enthusiasm, the sum of the two, multiplied by the length of time, yields the score of the result. Do not rush for quick results. Slogans should not be used lightly or abused. They should be solemn and simple.</p>
<p>News from Nan Tie Jun (omitted)</p>
<p>(Asked about organizing a secret assassination squad to assassinate those who privately sell Japanese goods)</p>
<p>(Reply) Do not worry, do not be indignant. They sell Japanese goods privately. Do they not know how to love the country? It's just that their love of country is not as great as their love of themselves and their families. If our propaganda and persuasion work is used thoroughly and for a long time, they will definitely be moved. Are all Indians Gandhi? They are eventually influenced by Gandhi's sincerity. We have not heard of India assassinating those who privately use British goods. Using assassination to prohibit it is not a fundamentally good method.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the editor,</p>
<p>Today's English-language Continental Daily News and The China Times reported a message from the Kuomin News Agency stating that our company's aircraft number 601 was forced to land in Hefei, in central Anhui province, due to running out of fuel. We were extremely shocked upon reading this. After investigation, our company does not have aircraft number 601, and Hefei is not on our flight route. How could our company's aircraft have an accident there? This kind of news from the agency is completely inaccurate. Besides sending another letter to the agency asking them to correct it as soon as possible, we are deeply afraid that the agency may also send manuscripts to your newspaper. We are writing this special letter to you, hoping that you will publish the original letter in the "Letters" column to clarify the truth. Sincerely, China National Aviation Corporation, October 23rd.</p>
<p>To the editor,</p>
<p>On the 20th of this month, the Shanghai newspapers published a notice from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to all merchants in the city, stating that the anti-Japanese conference resolved to return the Japanese-made surveying paper of the Hydrographic Bureau, etc. We were extremely surprised. After investigation, the Bureau has never purchased Japanese goods, including all the surveying paper, surveying instruments, and tools. The notice must be falsely using the name to try to insinuate something. In addition to sending separate letters to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Anti-Japanese Association to inquire, we should ask your newspaper to publish this item in the "Letters" section to correct it. Sincerely, Hydrographic Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy, October 22nd.</p>

<h3>Foch's War Memoirs Translated by Gu Angruo</h3>
<p>The task of the French army was to protect the British army on the one hand and attack the Selle River line on the other. The French First Army linked the attack on the right wing of the British army. Due to the influence of the British army's attack on Vassigny, it occupied the Hunding-Strond trench between the Errias River and the Selle River from October 18th to 26th. The Tenth Army took the opportunity to attack the Selle River and the Aisne River line from the side, occupying Verneuil and Notre-Dame.</p>
<p>Attacked on both sides, the German army withdrew from a large area of defense between Guise and Crécy on the 27th.</p>
<p>At the same time, the French Fifth Army attacked west of Chemon-Pourcien and occupied the last section of the Hunding-Strond line on the 25th, that is, the section between Saint-Quentin and the Aisne River. The operational plan of the French left wing decided on October 19 aimed at occupying the Aisne River line, and progress was very smooth by the end of October.</p>
<p>Now we review the battle on the right wing, which was undertaken by the French Fourth Army and the American First Army.</p>
<p>After three weeks of fierce fighting in mid-October, the left wing of the American First Army advanced to Grandpré, and the central route advanced to Romagne-sous-Montfaucon. The American army marched through the Argonne area from south to north with great difficulty. Most of the roads in this area run from west to east, and there is no way to arrange new traffic lines in this mountainous area. As a result, the large American troops in the artillery fire experienced various difficulties in resupply. However, their morale must not be allowed to be frustrated, and their fierce struggle must not be allowed to slacken.</p>
<p>I believe the best solution is to trust the self-determination spirit of the American Commander-in-Chief. The Allied Commander-in-Chief and American Commander-in-Chief Pershing established a direct relationship based on the same starting point between the French Commander-in-Chief, the British Commander-in-Chief, and the Belgian Commander-in-Chief. The American First Army is now fighting on the Argonne front, the Second Army is fighting in the Houffalize area, and the remaining American troops distributed on the front are not mentioned for the time being.</p>
<p>I believe that the American troops and other Allied troops will advance separately and inflict great blows on the enemy. I then resolutely and decisively increased the scope of command of the American Commander-in-Chief and appointed French General Maistre, commander of the central group of armies, to be responsible for liaison between the Argonne and Champagne areas.</p>
<p>Some people are not familiar with the difficulty of marching in the Argonne area and have misunderstandings about the American army's stagnation. For example, Clemenceau wrote to me on October 21, intending to replace the American Commander-in-Chief because of this. I have a clearer understanding of the difficulties encountered by the American army, so I cannot agree with Clemenceau's intense views. But I did not want to discuss this matter with the French Prime Minister, so I replied to him on October 23 as follows (to be continued).</p>
