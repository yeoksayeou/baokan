<h3 id="c22">抗日救國運動中軍人之責任 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>處於今日我國家民族生死存亡之最後關頭。我全體國民當前之唯一工作。爲抗日。爲救國</p>
<p>軍人爲武裝之國民。人民出其血汗。國家罄其財力。年供養二百萬之軍隊。其目的蓋在於保障人民。鞏固國家。故軍人之天職即爲衞民保國。而在今日抗日救國運動中。有人實應站在最前綫。其所負之責任。較一般人尤爲特重。東北半壁山。河一朝盡失。關外三千萬同胞。全陷於敵騎蹂躙。我負有鞏衞國家保護人民重責之軍隊。竟不發一彈而退。即身遭屠殺。亦竟毫不抵抗。一眞若人爲刀爼。我爲魚肉者。此種現象。實爲我國家我民族之大恥。</p>
<p>敵騎日益逼近。遼東鼙鼓。動地而來。今日之事。退讓不足以救亡。呼籲於公理。亦不足以救亡。惟自起努力。乃能自救。惟捨命犧牲。乃能救國。孫中山先生之軍人精神敎育。取智仁勇三德爲軍人人格之基本。而最後更取「决心。」諄諄訓誡。以爲成功成仁。皆在决心。决心能發揚軍人之精神。造成光輝之歷史。故我全國站在人民最前綫之二百萬軍人。處於今日情勢之下。應有最後之覺悟。應具最後之决心。</p>
<p>「殺身成仁。」今日即爲我全國軍人成仁之時。「殺敵致果。」今日亦即我全國軍人致果之日。民國二十年來。内戰不絶。每一次内戰奮身直前者。何莫非我勇敢之將士。死亡相枕者。又何莫非我英傑之軍人。二十年來犧牲於内戰者如此。而謂當此外患臨頭。國家危急存亡之秋。而無殺身成仁殺敵致果之决心。吾人不僅不敢信。抑亦不忍信。</p>
<p>吾人之所以於此一再申言者。非遂欲激起我全國將士。憑血氣之衝動。與强敵作暴虎憑河之决鬭。暴虎憑河爲匹夫之勇。一朝之忿。亡其身以及其親。此非我全國將士在今日所應取之態度。吾人之所希望於我英勇之全國將士者。乃在於認清自身保國衞民之責任。立下捨身取義之决心。預作効命疆塲之準備。激勵士氣。整齊步武。含悲忍憤。鎭靜自持。一旦動員令下。即奮然而起。抱满腔之悲憤。持必死之决心。彼曲我直。彼老而壯吾敢斷言。無堅不摧無强不破。</p>
<p>日南陸相近在師團長會議席次演說有云。「當此之時。奉職軍務者。當益固其奉公之誠。於敎育訓練盡其熱忱。期於完成本分之準備。無所欠缺。」彼作此言。乃在於侵我。在於發揚其軍國主義之特性。我國今日處於日禍方亟之際。則急需自衞自救。吾人敢借此言。爲我全國負責之軍人勗。</p>

<p>曾國藩吃了好幾個敗仗，幕府爲他草奏章，有「屢戰屢敗」之語，他拿起筆來一勾，便成了「屢敗屢戰」，精神爲之一振。一個手無捉雞之力的懦夫看了這一勾，立刻可以變成一個以一當百之壯士。</p>
<p>我凡遇事變，素以解决數學問題之態度相待，用冷靜的頭腦指示我沸騰的熱血之去路，所以絶少憤慨，亦少悲觀。惟自瀋陽失守後，每看張學良的電報，不禁令人怒髮衝冠。在這些電報裏只見是失守，退出，被死傷，被繳械，不見有大無畏精神之表現。這是澆在民族精神之火燄上的冷水。戰而敗，國民原諒你。敗而戰，國民敬重你。你戰而敗，敗而不戰，國民終有一天要和你算賬。因爲你所失掉的不止是土地，而且是立國之精神。你現在還有戴罪立功的機會，如果錯過了，那是多麽可惜啊！</p>

<p>— 陳柱尊</p>
<p>廿年秋九月。十九日黎明。日兵肆强暴。奪我奉天城。吉林相繼陷。禍將至北平。更易我官吏。殺戮我民萌。噩耗東北來。國人相嗟驚。始從夢中醒。同胞呼弟兄。豆萁爾何仇。急急相煎烹。國仇棄不顧。黨怨何分明。呼者聲已嘶。聞者誰能聽。徒令徒手士。紙上談戈兵。宣而不能戰。標語書紅青。豈知狡獪敵。不宣兵臨城。併吞我三省。猶云局部行。吾聞三省官。養兵多且精。號稱數十萬。東北任横行。一舉勝曹吳。再舉敗幽并。三舉滅叛石。奏凱騰歡聲。中國之驕子。華北之長城。如何敵國來。頃刻被犂庭。如摧枯拉槁。如割鮮烹牲。打狗入窮巷。拚死相搪撑。如何狗不如。退走不計程。桓桓中央軍。征伐如神明。一舉李白覆。再舉馮唐傾。三舉討赤匪。因之又南征。中央豈樂戰。要在保威名。將軍氣蓋世。百粤何足平。一心誅叛逆。誓不戴天生。聲威之所播。閃赫如雷霆。奈何敵國來。曾不迎一兵。城陷三四日。不聞赫怒聲。威信今何在。諾諾徒盈廷。追維平日事。徒欲飾太平。諱疾而忌醫。禍乃至斯呈。國亡嗟已久。豈待今始明。莫大於心死。言之涕從横。國家養戰士。將已廿年經。年耗萬萬金。到處皆旗旌。何怯於公戰。而勇於私爭。連年苦内亂。殺戮無時停。借債購外械。志氣各驕矜。軍分海陸空。三方相擊轟。川谷流人血。城郭爲丘陵。今猶戰未已。國亡更何營。吾恐數日後。終爲城下盟。不然日俄戰。牽動世界兵。死將無葬所。何敢望偷生。吾願舉國人。大夢同時醒。更願干城士。禍福細權衡。國亡同爲奴。富貴非汝榮。早早棄嫌怨。爲國謀中興。復願青年士。意氣莫浮輕。潛心求學術。罷課徒犧牲。讀書破萬卷。爲國致昇平。往事昨日死。來者今日生。十年事生聚。十年敎訓明。萬學皆精進。士農工商兵。各各盡天職。盡如弟與兄。庶幾雪國恥。竹帛書勛名。詩成九頓首。請鑒區區誠。</p>

<p>明倭寇擾我海疆。而吾邑喜定屢瀕於危。城爲所陷者數。嘉靖三十三年四月十六日。賊大至。復圍縣城。時隣近州郡皆被侵略。自救不暇。邑宰陰鳳麟。係府敎授署縣事。又惶急不知所措。士民計議。始定分堞。作自衞之策。而是日晨賊薄城。晝掠四鄉。夜舉火焚燒。哭聲徧野。屍骸積爲京觀。某夕。賊薄西門。已登陴矣。守者方入睡鄉。乃梯而上。及女牆。適某童城下篝燈瞥見之。遂引吭大呼。衆驚醒。亟舉石紛投。梯斷而退。然俯視童子。頭已墮地。血腥觸鼻矣。嗣會河南人楊松在邑。先後殺賊數百。相持匝月。始遁走。當事者感童子之膽壯勇敢。破賊之詭謀。羣議琢一石象。象成。東向。坐城闉上。至今存焉。西門位漳浦。故名合浦門。惜童子邑乘不載其姓氏。卒成無名之英雄耳。雖然。以視今之暴日大舉入寇。而南北當軸。擁有節旄。平日儼然無異坐大。一旦寇至。猶在夢中。而吾號稱四萬萬民衆。日以打倒帝國主義自厲。各各居於主人地位者。亦一任盜賊業已入室發篋。盡掠我寳物以去。乃始驚駭錯愕。而責守者之不愼。曾童子之不若。亦復何歟。噫、吾不忍言已。</p>

<p>— 任培初</p>
<p>中華基督敎青年會於九月二十五日晩請施高脱博士演講。題爲「如何减少聾子的苦痛。」是晩鄙人適往青年會訪友。乘便加入聽講。歸而記之於下。</p>
<p>聾子的苦痛　施云。余（施氏自稱）乃一研究哲學而非研究醫學者。對於耳聾之治療方面。絶不明瞭。惟因余係數十年缺少聽力之遠年老聾子。深知聾子所得之苦痛。有甚於盲目與啞吧。盲目雖苦。然無論何人。一望而知其爲殘廢者。莫不爲之可憐也。哑吧有口無話。禍不來臨。聾子則形色上絶無表示殘廢狀態。而與人談話時。往往糾纏不清。言語衝撞。致遭對方之辱。有時竟若起極大風波。再若聾子在路上行走。不幸被汽車撞傷。而車夫必以曾拉笛聲多次。車機一時不及停止等詞狡辯。若非聾子。則可指其說謊。此時聾子獨無言可辯。不亦苦哉。</p>
<p>組織聨合會　聾子在社會上。所享受之利益。僅占普通人之十分之四。凡需用聽覺者。非其分也。生活實甚枯燥。其補救之法。莫如組織一聾子聨合會。會中附設俱樂部及職業介紹所兩項。前者供聾子娱樂。後者助聾子謀生活。如此可减少聾子之枯寂。</p>
<p>特殊聽講式　是日聽講者。十分之八皆患聾同胞。始而僅以雙手招風狀。揷於兩耳之後以助聽。繼因聲浪尚不能達耳。於是漸離坐位。羣向講台迎去。終則羣聾畢集於講台四週。將老聾施高脱博士。圍在中心。然羣聾猶以爲未足。仍用其雙手。作招風狀。揷於耳後云。</p>

<p>— 許晩成</p>
<p>音化者謂以音樂感化民衆也。蓋音樂在宇宙中最能使一切和諧美满。激昻感化。孔子曰。「樂者天下之和也。……和。故天下皆化。」太史公曰。「音樂者。所以盪動血脈。流通精神。而和正心也。」威廉第二曰。「音樂足以轉移人類惡濁·萎靡·之靈魂。使之純潔·激揚·而日益向上。」悲多芬Beethonen曰。「崇高偉大之人格。聖哲之思想。與夫蓋世的功業。祇有從音樂的陶冶可以狻是與養成。」</p>
<p>總之「音樂是表現感情的藝術。所謂」一曲悲歌。千人泣下。」昔管仲相齊桓。一次率師遠征。山嶺險阻。士卒感覺上山之不易。管仲作「上山難兮下山易」歌。此唱彼和。歌聲響激雲霄。士卒極度之疲勞。因是振足。又楚漢相爭。項羽被困垓下。（現今安徽靈壁縣東南）張子房一曲洞筆。令楚軍軍心渙散。於此知音樂感化羣衆之深。有轉移個人感情之勢。</p>
<p>世界各國無不重視「音樂」。美國將於一九三三年在支加哥舉行全國音樂家·詩人·及文學家·聨合會議。英國倫敦最大之禮拜堂Trurocathedral近組織唱歌隊。隊員有千餘人。又德國Messiah城。每年以三十萬馬克。奬予該城之第一名音樂家。</p>
<p>當此秋高氣爽。國難臨頭。中華市政協進會於九月二十七日晩舉行「音化救國宣傳。」黄警頑氏負責籌備。并請繆治捷陳歌辛陸丹林諸氏襄助。是晩節目頗多。</p>
<p>女博士致開會辭法學博士錢劍秋女士致開會詞。大意係「音化救國宣傳之主旨。與我人抗日救國應有認識。」語多警惕。是晩錢博士并偕其老母暨法母博士黄比瀛氏到會。</p>
<p>王慶勳大賣氣力　是晩中華口琴會會長黄慶勳氏。領導中華口琴隊唱黨歌。領導省立上海中學口琴隊吹「勇往直前。」王氏又口琴獨奏「天堂與地獄。」并乘機演講。語氣激昻。聞者動容。蓋王氏臺灣人。身遭日帝國主義之殘暴。怨憤塡胸。不得不吐。繼而慷慨高歌。聽衆精神益振。</p>
<p>陳歌辛哀感放聲　上海女中音樂敎授陳歌辛氏。嗓子特佳。是晩獨唱「聞卿呼我」「我的媽媽。」哀感動人。吭音有三日繞樑之概。</p>
<p>兩女孩合唱民歌　章文燦林慕豪兩小姐。年均十四五。身材相等。口琴合奏「暹羅民歌」音調抑揚合拍。頗有表情藝術。</p>
<p>是晩尚有其他節目。感時悲歌。盛極一時。至九時散會。</p>
<p>自有質」「中和誠可維。」上句陶潛。下句曹植。孫公達先生集遺山半山句「玉川文章五千卷。」「湖海聲名二十年。」周瘦鵑先生句云。「疇曰無聞。卓犖才名驚四海。」「斯眞不惑。文章事業定千秋。」董晳薌先生集易林「砥學勵行。樂我嘉友。」「增榮益譽。使君延年。」徐叔良先生句云。「辣手文章多著述。」「满天明月照壽星。」其他佳句頗多。不及遍錄。畫有方藥雨·楊雲史·黄秋野·尹柏寒·陳彦衡·劉敢生·何秋江·姚鏡夫·石裔唐·方曉舲諸先生江南蘋女士等之作品。或松柏或竹桃。或梅菊。各擅其妙。詩則自北而至者。有王書衡·張岱杉·李新吾·沈硯簃·夏蔚如·陳仲騫·黄君坦·祝紹棠·倉錫青·邢隅三·劉本義等諸先生之佳叶。在高如袁伯夔·夏劍丞·汪擷荀·陳彦通·湯斐予·王冷齋·劉曼若彦唐昆仲·路鐵珊·黄又牧·范石如·程永言·夏菊儂·孫佩笙·亦各致五言或七律。名句流傳。詞長不錄。聞睇嚮齋主將彙刊頡册。藉留鴻爪云。（不受酬）</p>

<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>「不，現在我探聽明白了，那夜汽車裏的女人，不過是一個娼妓，而這個娼妓已另外嫁了人，這個人，恰是我的朋友之朋友，所以我全知道了。」</p>
<p>「那麽他買的木器什麽用處呢？」</p>
<p>「你不要灰心，他將來一定會回心轉意的；不說别的，便像我的妻子，以前我已灰心到了極點，如今是……」</p>
<p>「不錯，你的夫人眞是一個丈夫的妻了了。」</p>
<p>「那麽你明天準走？」</p>
<p>「準走。也許我住着三五天，散散心，便回上海。」</p>
<p>李夫人說到這裏，心裏如刀割一般的難受，便伸手和陳先生握了一握，忍住了淚，苦笑了一笑，便走回自己屋子裏去。</p>
<p>陳夫人一夜不曾回家，陳先生心裏，是十分的不安寗，他疑心伊也許在路上被汽車撞倒，也許故態復萌；但是絶不疑心伊這兩個多月的馴善，是一種特殊的作用。</p>
<p>他眞可憐李夫人，只爲了自己的名譽與地位，絶不敢做一件驚人的事件，去營救李夫人。他也知道李夫人也愛他，也没有胆量做一件驚人的事件改嫁給他，大家都是愛莫能助。</p>
<p>一夜的焦思苦慮，不曾闔過眼；李夫人也是整整的哭了一夜。但是李先生在夜半兩點鐘回家了以後，便登床酣眠，不去理會伊。</p>
<p>伊清早起身，只留着一個條子給丈夫，便匆匆出門，乘車到杭州去了。</p>
<p>陳先生在起身没有好久的時候，突然接到了一封律師的信，他拆視了以後。氣得手都顫了——是一封律師代表他妻子，向他要求離婚的信。</p>
<p>他因爲這信中所持的理由，第一欵便指他與李夫人有曖昧關係，所以拿了信便去找李先生，希望李先生能帮助他證明李夫人絶對没有關係。</p>
<p>但是李先生却淡淡的說道；「女人的心，要是變了，是無可挽回的，大丈夫何患無妻子，伊要离婚，便允許伊吧：現在我的妻子，也不别而行，也許伊將仿效你的妻子，送一封律師信給我呢。但是我狠信任你，决不會和我妻子有什麽關係。」（完）</p>

<p>Interview with Factory Director Li Yichun</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Yichun, director of the Shenyang mortar factory, said that the factory buildings in the North Barracks have been completely destroyed, and each part of the factory building in the city has been hit by machines, with five people killed and over twenty injured. The number of deaths and injuries in the North Barracks is unknown, because no one can go there now after the Japanese army occupied it. The light machines, manufactured mortars, and materials have all been taken away. Over 400,000 rounds of ammunition and over 400,000 pounds of gunpowder in storage have been either destroyed or transported away. The total loss exceeds 20 million. The most regrettable is the automobile manufacturing unit, which had completed over ten vehicles and was about to complete over ninety more, all of which were taken away by the Japanese army and used to transport valuable items from various government offices, which is particularly painful. Currently, only two of the vehicles built are left, and they are on display at the Shanghai Road City Exhibition. Investigation of automobile manufacturing began four years ago. Because the artillery factory's machinery was used, the capital was only 750,000 yuan. Now it is difficult to raise capital to restart, so this new construction has become a flash in the pan. Shenyang sorghum, which used to cost 1.3 yuan per dou, has now risen to 3 Japanese yen and is still difficult to obtain. Fengtian residents are accustomed to storing rice, but transportation has been cut off, so the four villages are even more impoverished. The officials and gentry remaining in Shenyang are only Chairman Zang, Director Jin, County Magistrate Li, and a few others such as Yuan Jinkai and Yu Chonghan. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A Chinese employee of the Shenyang Mortar Factory arrived in Tianjin today and told the Reuters reporter about the situation when the Japanese soldiers occupied the arsenal on the night of September 18. He said that the mortar factory was located in Guangchang, in the northwest village of Shenyang. On that night, there were about forty or fifty guards stationed in the factory and about eight staff members and twenty servants inside and outside the factory. When the sound of gunfire started, Colonel Dong, the commander of the guards, telephoned the factory director for instructions. The factory director said that he had received an order from the deputy commander: If Japanese soldiers enter the arena, do not resist. The workers' residential area in the east of the factory heard the sound of gunfire and became uneasy, wanting to abandon their houses and escape. At about 2 a.m. on the 19th, Colonel Dong went to comfort the workers. As soon as he returned to his residence, he was killed by Japanese soldiers on the spot. The Japanese soldiers then went to the workers' residences and threw grenades, killing and wounding more than thirty workers. The Japanese soldiers mostly used guns to stab and slaughter indiscriminately. I saw one person whose arms and legs were severed. The Japanese soldiers then went to the main building and first threw grenades like rain, then entered the building. About eight Chinese servants and about three or four Chinese soldiers were killed there. None of these people had resisted. These events all occurred between 2:15 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. on the morning of the 19th. The first team of Japanese soldiers, about fifty in number, exited through the main gate. Afterwards, another team, about thirty in number, came, but those who came later only patrolled once and did not cause any damage. Then there was silence until about 6 a.m. at dawn, when a Japanese detachment arrived in freight cars and occupied the entire factory. The mortar factory had recently been改造 to transport freight cars, and many vehicles were about to be completed. The Japanese soldiers drove them all away. I personally saw the Japanese soldiers driving several of these vehicles on the road. There are many Chinese and foreign employees at the arsenal, some of whom have served in the European war. According to them, the shells that bombarded the arsenal were fired from cannons with a caliber of fifteen millimeters, and the artillery positions must have been located at the Japanese military training ground near the South Manchuria Railway station. A total of eighteen shells were fired, but only one or two shells fell on the arsenal square, killing one Chinese soldier in the airfield across from the arsenal. By dawn, the arsenal and airfield were all in the hands of the Japanese soldiers, without any resistance whatsoever. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Yesterday, a Shenyang telegram widely circulated that the Chinese authorities were preparing to negotiate with Japan in Jin County. According to a certain person from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, since the Shenyang Incident occurred, the telegrams between Deputy Commander Zhang and the Central Government have been frequent, and everything is being handled in accordance with the Central Government's wishes. The above statement is definitely not true, and it is thought to be Japanese people concocting an atmosphere to incite international listening. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person said that this time, various places in the Northeast have been illegally occupied by Japan, and our great rivers and mountains will become a continuation of Korea. In recent days, the Central Government is strictly planning its future policy towards Japan. The Northeast authorities are all obeying the Central Government's orders and will definitely not be resolved by local authorities. It is heard that the Japanese side has the idea of using Zhang Zuoxiang for local negotiations, intending to return the rights of the Northeast to the Northeast and take a protective position. In reality, it is imitating the old method of dealing with Korea, so that the sovereignty of the Northeast will gradually fall into its hands. However, the authorities and Zhang Zuoxiang are deeply aware of this, preferring to be shattered jade than an intact tile. Therefore, although the Japanese have many cunning plans, they will eventually be resolved by the Central Government in accordance with the law. Because the Central Government hopes that Deputy Zhang will go to the capital, he may go south in the near future. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e22">The Responsibility of Soldiers in the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>At this final critical juncture for the life and death of our nation and people, the only task facing all our citizens is to resist Japan and save the country.</p>
<p>Soldiers are armed citizens. The people provide their blood and sweat, and the nation spends its wealth, to support an army of two million men annually. The purpose of this army is to protect the people and consolidate the country. Therefore, the duty of soldiers is to defend the people and protect the country. And in today's anti-Japanese national salvation movement, soldiers should stand on the front lines and bear a heavier responsibility than the average person. In one day, half of the land of the Northeast was lost, and thirty million compatriots outside the Pass were subjected to the trampling of enemy cavalry. Our army, which bears the heavy responsibility of consolidating the country and protecting the people, retreated without firing a shot. Even when facing massacre, it offered no resistance whatsoever, as if men were knives and chopping boards and we were the fish and meat. This phenomenon is a great shame for our country and our nation.</p>
<p>The enemy cavalry is approaching daily. The sound of war drums from Liaodong shakes the earth. Today, retreat is not enough to save the country, and appeals to justice are also not enough to save the country. Only by rising up and working hard can we save ourselves. Only by sacrificing ourselves can we save the country. Sun Yat-sen's education on the military spirit takes the three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage as the foundation of a soldier's personality, and finally emphasizes "determination" with earnest instruction, believing that success and integrity depend on determination. Determination can promote the military spirit and create a glorious history. Therefore, the two million soldiers in our country who stand on the front lines of the people, in today's situation, should have a final awakening and possess a final determination.</p>
<p>"Sacrificing oneself to achieve righteousness" is the time for soldiers throughout the country to achieve righteousness. "Killing the enemy to achieve results" is also the time for soldiers throughout the country to achieve results. In the twenty years of the Republic of China, internal wars have been incessant. In every internal war, those who fought bravely to the end were our brave generals, and those who died in stacks were our heroic soldiers. If they have sacrificed so much in internal wars over the past twenty years, and do not have the determination to sacrifice themselves for righteousness and kill the enemy to achieve results when faced with external troubles and the critical moment of the country's survival, we not only dare not believe it, but also cannot bear to believe it.</p>
<p>The reason we repeatedly state this is not to incite the soldiers throughout the country to clash with the strong enemy out of a surge of blood and courage. To act rashly and fight bare-handed is the courage of a common man, leading to the loss of one's life and the lives of one's relatives. This is not the attitude that soldiers throughout the country should adopt today. What we hope from our brave soldiers throughout the country is to recognize their own responsibility to protect the country and defend the people, to make the determination to sacrifice themselves for righteousness, to prepare to serve the country on the battlefield, to inspire morale, to keep order, to contain grief and anger, and to remain calm and composed. Once the mobilization order is issued, they should rise up bravely, holding a heart full of grief and anger and a determination to die. When they are wrong and we are right, and when they are old and we are strong, we dare to say that nothing is unbreakable and nothing is invincible.</p>
<p>Japanese Minister of the Army Minami recently said in a speech at a division commander's meeting, "At this time, those who are engaged in military affairs should strengthen their sincerity in serving the public, devote their enthusiasm to education and training, and strive to complete their preparations without any shortcomings." He made this statement to invade us and to promote the characteristics of their militarism. Today, when our country is facing an imminent Japanese catastrophe, we urgently need to defend and save ourselves. We dare to borrow this statement to encourage the responsible soldiers throughout the country.</p>

<p>If Willing to Join the Military to Serve the Country, Military Training Can Be Received</p>
<p>Students Have Been Sent Back to Shanghai in Three Groups</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Over three thousand students from more than ten schools including Shanghai Guanghua University, Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Jinan University, Law and Politics University, Datong University, Chizhi University, Sino-French University, various colleges such as China Public School, Culture, Jiangnan, Law and Politics, and the Art School, arrived in Nanjing one after another. Representatives of the Student Union served as the general commander, with a commander for each school. Starting on the morning of the 29th, they were transported into the city in batches by the Nanjing city small train. Chairman Chiang instructed them to gather in the auditorium of the Central Military Academy at 2:00 PM to be received. The Shanfeng Union representative presented two petitions. Chiang took the stage and reported, saying that everyone has endured hunger and cold, wind and rain, and come here to petition with patriotic sincerity, which shows that the people's hearts are not dead and there is great hope for the future. It also makes the Chairman feel twelve times more courageous and powerful, which is very gratifying. Regarding the issue of resisting Japan and saving the country, the five points of the petition made by the representatives of various universities in Shanghai to the National Government yesterday have all received very sincere and detailed answers. I think everyone already understands. What I want to declare to everyone again today is that the National Government is definitely not a traitorous government like the warlord era, but the only revolutionary government, and will never sign any treaties that humiliate the country and forfeit its sovereignty. All the points of your petition are accepted with sincerity. However, as the saying goes, a country must first be attacked by itself before others attack it. True patriots must unanimously support the current government, so that it can become a strong and unified country, so as to increase its external strength. If there is no unity within the country, and you want to win diplomatic victories, it is absolutely impossible. The people in the government are working actively day and night to make all preparations for dealing with foreign countries, and will never abandon their responsibilities and become sinners of the country in the future. I am also determined to share life and death with the people, so as not to betray the trust of the people. As for you young people, at this time, you should be diligent and calm, cultivate your moral character, and every minute of time wasted is a minute of study lost, and the country will lose a minute of strength. The constant petitions of everyone have inevitably diverted some time and energy from the government's colleagues, which has affected the planning of all politics and diplomacy, and the enemy has the opportunity to disturb and weaken us, and I am afraid that it will turn into an opportunity for counter-revolutionaries to take advantage of.

<p>(Beiping) Representatives of the Peiping Anti-Japanese National Salvation Congress, led by Tang Guozhen and Shen Zutong, visited Vice Commander Zhang at Shuncheng Prince's Mansion at 5:00 PM today. After Zhang finished reading the proposal, he replied that diplomatic issues must listen to the command of the central government and will never be directly negotiated. Cao Rulin was invited to talk because he was familiar with the situation in Japan and submitted a memorandum. He can be told that the so-called policy of non-resistance is actually a misunderstanding. In order to prevent the Japanese from provoking beforehand, he ordered them not to resist, but he never expected it to be like this. Now the various armies have reached considerable locations, and all matters are subject to the central government. (28th special dispatch)</p>

China must be unified before it can deal with foreign countries. If China is unified, this matter would not have happened. If I, Zhang, do anything that betrays the country, please kill me without regret. All things must be done by yourselves. If you take the opportunity to interfere with the government, like overthrowing A and overthrowing B, these are not good signs for the country. In short, I, Zhang Xueliang, am willing to do everything myself. If I do anything that betrays the country, you can kill me and cut off my head, and I will be willing." After Zhang finished speaking, he showed a very painful and forbearing expression. (29th special dispatch)</p>

Lele, the acting chairman of the Administrative Council, reported to the chairman of the council on the steps taken regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute in Manchuria, saying that the Administrative Council will continue to work to resolve the dispute between the two countries peacefully. The chairman of the council stated that the council deeply believes that the efforts of the Administrative Council will achieve good results. The council then discussed the issue of armaments. (29th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council adjourned today. Thereafter, unless a very major international event occurs, it will reopen next autumn according to custom. This morning, at the last meeting, Lele, the chairman of the council, stated that he had hoped to report to the council today the final resolution of the Manchurian Incident between China and Japan. Unfortunately, despite the greatest efforts of the council, a resolution has not yet been reached. However, the council trusts Japan's declaration that it does not covet Chinese territory and that the Japanese army will withdraw from the areas along the South Manchurian Railway as soon as possible, and deeply believes that the goodwill of both sides and direct negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese governments will be the best way to achieve a final resolution. The council will continue to promote this method until a resolution is reached. Thereupon, the chairman of the council, Titescu, replied that the council has no indication that it must intervene in the Sino-Japanese crisis or discuss the council's handling. He also said that the council can approve his and Lele's words. (29th National Society dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the Administrative Council adjourned today, acting Chairman Lele announced that the Administrative Council will reconvene to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue, and the meeting period will be extended for several days. This decision is quite supported by the Chinese</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Representative Shi Zhaoji, because China now very much hopes that the League of Nations can effectively intervene and help to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Manchurian Incident. The Administrative Council's session was originally scheduled to end today, and tonight's decision to extend the session should strengthen the Nanjing government's efforts to restrain radical claims and achieve a peaceful resolution. This afternoon, the Administrative Council held a plenary meeting to discuss the Manchurian crisis. Many people were still paying close attention. Lele spoke, first mentioning yesterday's beating of Wang Zhengting by Nanjing students, expressing the Administrative Council's unanimous sympathy for Wang. He then protested the dissemination of false news related to the Manchurian Incident. He asked the world's media not to make biased and hasty remarks, and advised journalists to cooperate with the League of Nations Administrative Council to ensure that the Sino-Japanese conflict is resolved peacefully. Japanese representative Aizawa then took the floor, expressing regret for what happened in Nanjing yesterday, and said that Dr. Wang is his friend, and he respects him very much. He expressed his keen sympathy. Shi Zhaoji thanked the Administrative Council and Aizawa for their sympathy towards Wang, and said that the Chinese government is now making every effort to calm public opinion. Aizawa then read a long text, stating that the Japanese government has now received petitions from Japanese residents in northern Manchuria and Jiandao for the dispatch of troops to protect them. Although the situation of the Japanese residents is not peaceful, the Japanese government has decided not to comply with their request in order to avoid making the situation even more serious. The withdrawal of troops today is in progress. The Japanese troops stationed in Jilin have been reduced again and again since Friday when he received a letter from the Japanese government stating that the Japanese troops have been successively withdrawn from the occupied areas. Outside the Jilin and Shenyang areas, only Xinmintun and Zhengjiatun are allowed to retain a small number of soldiers in order to protect the Japanese residents from attacks by Chinese soldiers and bandits who have been rampant in the territory recently. Colonel Soan Hill, the military attache of the British Embassy in Beiping, is now inspecting the details of the Japanese troop withdrawal. The Japanese government will notify the Administrative Council at any time of the various plans it is implementing to quickly resolve the difficulties. After Aizawa finished reading his text, Shi Zhaoji said that he listened to the Japanese representative's remarks with great attention, especially to the troop withdrawal. He would be even happier if he knew that the Japanese army had withdrawn completely. He did not know what the Japanese representative would say about the Japanese planes attacking passenger cars between Shenyang and Beiping. He would like to hear about it. The train that was shot at had no Chinese soldiers inside, and there were no traces of Chinese soldiers in the nearby area. China lives in the best friendship with all countries in the world, not only with Japan. Everyone hopes that the original state will be restored as soon as possible. In a spirit of reconciliation, he abandoned the request he made a few days ago to immediately send a neutral international investigation team to Manchuria, and intends to ask the Administrative Council to continue to assist in Geneva to enable the two countries to resolve the issue peacefully on the spot. Aizawa replied, denying the Chinese side's claim that the Japanese army had massacred Chinese women and children, and said that he could not give a definite date for the complete withdrawal of the Japanese army from the occupied areas. He will telegraph the Chinese proposal for direct negotiations to the Japanese government. At this point, the Chinese and Japanese representatives argued for a long time. Aizawa agreed to Shi Zhaoji's proposal that Chinese and Japanese representatives should meet immediately in Manchuria to establish a proposal for a peaceful resolution, but did not agree to the Chinese proposal for other countries to join the committee. Shi Zhaoji insisted that the Administrative Council should participate in the negotiations between the two countries. Aizawa also replied that he could not convey this proposal to the Japanese government. All he could do was to telegraph the Chinese proposal for direct negotiations to the government. Japan has no intention of starting a war with China. Japan, like China, wants to quickly and satisfactorily resolve the difficulties. British representative Cecil said that direct negotiations should begin immediately. If difficulties are encountered, this issue can be submitted to the Administrative Council again. The chairman stated that he will make a statement on the Manchurian Incident at tomorrow's meeting of the League of Nations Council. The Administrative Council's session will be extended for several days. The meeting then adjourned. The Secretary-General of the League of Nations, on the order of the Administrative Council, notified Nanjing and Tokyo of the minutes of today's meeting. The League of Nations Council will adjourn tomorrow after listening to Lele's report on the current situation of the Administrative Council and Manchuria. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a telegram from Ambassador Shi, stating that the League of Nations advocated that Lele, as a representative of the League of Nations, express condolences for the injuries of Foreign Minister Wang, and that Japanese representative Aizawa represents the Japanese delegation in expressing condolences to our Foreign Minister Wang. (29th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations' efforts to promote a resolution to the Manchurian Incident have encountered another obstacle today. The Council previously proposed organizing a committee to go to Liaoning to investigate and stipulate the date of the Japanese troop withdrawal. Chinese Ambassador Shi strongly argued that the committee must have neutral national members. Japanese representative Aizawa said that if this committee is not purely composed of Chinese and Japanese members, he can only ask for instructions from his government before replying. Later, Chairman Lele announced that at the last meeting of the League of Nations on Tuesday, the Council will make a fair report on the progress of the efforts to mediate so far and the attitudes of both China and Japan. According to the reports, after the League of Nations Council held a meeting today, Chairman Lele expressed regret for the beating of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting at the ministry yesterday, saying that this was caused by the Chinese people's misunderstanding of the actions of the League of Nations Council, so he felt very regretful. Japanese representative Aizawa also expressed his sympathy for Wang on a private level. Then, Ambassador Shi gave a speech, demanding that Japan immediately release all the Chinese people captured in the past ten days, return all the occupied Chinese property, and return the weapons of the Chinese soldiers who have been disarmed in the three provinces. Japanese representative Aizawa then said that Shi's proposal that the Council jointly stipulate the date for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, he will immediately ask for instructions from the Tokyo government, but repeatedly opposed the League of Nations sending personnel to investigate, saying that the Manchurian situation has made great progress. Even though Japanese residents in southern Manchuria and the Sino-Korean border requested military protection, the Japanese authorities are still withdrawing troops one after another. Since Friday, the troops stationed in Jilin have been withdrawn successively. At present, outside the area attached to the South Manchurian Railway, only Jilin and Shenyang, as well as Xinmin and Zhengjiatun, still have some Japanese troops stationed. Foreign officials and press representatives in Beiping can freely go to verify the certainty of the Japanese troop withdrawal, so Japan believes that the League of Nations has no need to send personnel to investigate. Finally, Aizawa reiterated that the Japanese government has no ambition to occupy territory. Like China, Japan wants to quickly and satisfactorily resolve the difficulties. Ambassador Shi then declared that if the Council can stipulate a date for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, then the Chinese representative may as well abandon the request for an international investigation committee. (28th National Society dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, the League of Nations Council reopened to discuss the Manchurian Incident. Chairman Lele expressed regret for the beating of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, saying that this was caused by the dissemination of inaccurate information about the Council's meetings. Chinese and Japanese representatives also expressed regret, and welcomed the Secretary-General's announcement that he intended to report the minutes of the League of Nations meetings to the League of Nations offices in Nanjing and Tokyo at any time. Then, the Japanese representative declared that the Japanese troops in Manchuria are currently withdrawing. At present, outside the area attached to the South Manchurian Railway, only Jilin, Shenyang, Zhengjiatun, and Xinmintun have Japanese troops stationed. Japan intends to complete the troop withdrawal as soon as possible, and to ensure that the lives and property of Japanese residents are not endangered. Then, the Chinese representative made a compromise proposal, asking the Council to assist the Chinese and Japanese sides to negotiate and reach an agreement as soon as possible, so that a date for the early withdrawal of Japanese troops can be stipulated. In this way, it can be avoided the need to send a neutral national investigation team. Thereupon, the Council began to discuss, and both sides made arguments. As a result, the Chinese representative was asked to submit a written proposal for the Council to consider. The Council will schedule a follow-up meeting in the coming days.

<p>Telegram from Beiping, all newspapers please note: Our nation does not produce [internal] strife, yet disasters occur frequently. Now, the heavy burden of floods torments the lives of the people. The shared suffering is about to endanger the foundation of the nation, a shocking sight. A crisis is imminent, and the effort to remedy and save [the situation] has not yet been undertaken. Who would have thought that at this moment of worry and concern, external pursuers would recklessly seize and invade our borders, slaughtering our people with a cruelty and excessiveness beyond compare. Alarming reports are spreading, and the whole world can see. Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel a surge of sorrow. I believe that the precarious state of the nation truly relies on the support of all. How can one hope for intact eggs when the nest is overturned? How can one resist external aggression while fighting internally? The moment between survival and destruction is critical. Only the enlightened leaders of the Party and the nation, and the virtuous people within the country, can lead by example and navigate through these troubles together. They must completely eliminate all previous factional disputes, resentments, and emotional impulses, uniting our four thousand ten thousand square *li* into one family, and our four hundred million people into one body. With concerted efforts and united strength, we can reverse the desperate situation. Only then can we ensure that we, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, do not become slaves, waiting to be punished in the military ranks, vowing to obey. The nation's grand plan should not be decided hastily. Because of the imminent danger, every citizen has a responsibility. [We must] taste gall and sleep on brushwood [to steel our resolve], and together strengthen this resolve, sacrificing ourselves without hesitation, all with a firm determination. Speaking with tears, the situation is unavoidable. It is hoped that [you] will consider and adopt [this proposal], urgently catch up, don armor, and wield weapons, vowing to follow the whip, filling [our] chests with pain and anger, not choosing words in haste. I respectfully express my humble sincerity and humbly request [your] inspection. - Zhang Zuoxiang, Shang Zhen, Wan Fulin, Tang Yulin, Xu Yongchang, Wang Shuchang, Fu Zuoyi, Song Zheyuan, Yu Xuezhong, Yang Aiyuan, Shen Honglie, Zhang Huanxiang, Pang Bingxun, Liu Yifei, Sun Kuiyuan, Zhang Haipeng, Sun Chu, Yu Zhishan, Zhou Dai, Fu Zhan Kui, Zhao Chengshou, Wang Yizhe, Rong Honglu, He Zhuguo, Gao Guizi, Dong Yingbin, Zhang Zizhong, Chen Guanqun, Feng Zhian, Zhang Tingshu, Yang Xiaoxiao, Ding Chao, Feng Pengzhu, Li Zhentang, Li Fuying, Su Bingwen, Yang Chengyuan, Ma Zhanshan, Wang Jingguo, Du Jiwu, Yang Yaofang, Zhang Chengde, Li Shengda, Sun Dequan, Zhang Huizhao, Shen Ke, Ling Xiao, Gao Renfu, Niu Yuanfeng, Shao Wenkai, Liu Duoquan, Zhang Shusen, Bai Fengxiang, Li Fuhe, Ding Xichun, Guo Xipeng, Zhao Ranxiang, Li Guilin, Yao Dongfan, Liu Hanqi, Li Du, Jiaocheng Liu, Chang Jingbu, Su Dechen, Zhang Zuozhou, Huang Shiyue, Wang Hehua, Xing Zhanqing, Ji Xing, Qiao Fang, Chang Yaochen, Cheng Zhiwei, Dong Futing, Liu Xiangjiu, Zhang Congyun, Yu Zhaolin, Wang Yongtai, Fu Chun, Cui Xinwu, Shi Wenhua, Dian Jiu, Wu Songlin, respectfully.</p>

Taking advantage of our crisis, the Japanese are once again committing atrocities, occupying our territory, and slaughtering our people, treating our nation as if it were nothing. A great disaster is imminent, and national demise is imminent. At this critical moment, it is time for our compatriots to jointly face the national crisis. After sorrow and indignation, all sectors in Nanping convened an anti-Japanese national salvation conference. Over forty thousand soldiers and civilians attended the meeting. After a unanimous resolution by the entire assembly, in addition to sending a telegram to the National Government requesting a declaration of war against Japan, with the military and civilians vowing to act as a rearguard, a telegram was also sent to the military and political authorities in Guangdong requesting them to set aside minor grievances and unite against external enemies, etc. Brothers fighting each other, [while] externally resist humiliation.

<p>Telegram from Hankou, all newspapers please note: For decades, Japan has used various means to seize our dependencies and usurp our rights and interests. Their atrocities and poisonous schemes are too numerous to count. We can no longer forget the extreme shame and humiliation. Now, taking advantage of our natural disasters and bandit troubles, they are groundlessly provoking incidents and suddenly dispatching troops, forcibly occupying our three northeastern provinces and the northeastern coasts, killing, trampling, and indulging in their ferocity. Alarming telegrams are repeatedly received, and the situation is deteriorating daily. They have no regard for international relations, no regard for humanity, and no regard for civilized treaties. There is no precedent for such barbarism in ancient or modern times, or at home or abroad. They simply do not regard us as a nation or as human beings. If we rely solely on legal appeals, they will use cunning and deceptive words on the one hand, while implementing destruction and massacre on the other. How can we endure this great pain? We believe that we must fight urgently to resist humiliation, and we must swear to die to seek survival. We humbly request that our Commander-in-Chief consider the sentiments of shared hatred across the country, declare the imminent danger of national demise, resolutely advocate for war, and set a date for action to wipe out our national shame and revitalize our nation. Dou Yin and others, as soldiers, would be fortunate to die for their country in the face of foreign aggression, rather than live as enslaved people. We are willing to be at the forefront, with unwavering righteousness, waiting for orders with weapons at the ready.

<h3 id="e67">Japanese Troops Invading Without Restraint <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Longjing Village and other places in Jilin have been successively occupied.</p>
<p>Situation in Harbin is tense, rumors of Japanese troops about to invade.</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: After the Japanese troops occupied Liaoning and Jilin, they divided their forces into various directions and successively reoccupied Jilin, Liaoyuan, Taonan, Fushun, Andong, Changtu, Sipingjie and other places in our country. On the 23rd, Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army, Shigeru Honjo, ordered the various armies to concentrate their forces in Gongzhuling, with the intention of expanding their military power to northern Manchuria. This, coupled with the Soviet Union's troop deployment in Manchuria, creates a state of high tension with swords drawn. If the Japanese troops advance north, Harbin may become a war zone. I will now relay what I have heard in recent days.</p>
<p>Appointment of Shenyang Mayor: Kwantung Army Commander Shigeru Honjo, after invading and occupying Shenyang, appointed the mayor of Fengtian in the name of the commander-in-chief. The order is excerpted as follows: (1) The Japanese military commander, in view of the current situation near Liaoning City and to promote the happiness of Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians, will implement temporary municipal administration in the area under the guidance of the Kwantung Army Commander from September 20th, Showa 6th year [1931]. (2) The municipal area of Liaoning City will be within the city of Liaoning and the commercial port, with the exception of the Manchurian Railway Affiliated Area, which will continue to be handled according to the previous regulations. The scope of municipal business is specifically defined, including everything related to Liaoning City. (3) The important municipal officials are as follows: Mayor: Colonel of the Army, Kenji Doihara; Chief Secretary: Shunichi Tomiharu; Chief of the General Affairs Section: Shin Ioriya; Chief of the Police Affairs Section: Nagataro Tsuruoka; Chief of the Finance Section: Suetsugu Mitani; Chief of the Hygiene Section: Fukumatsu Morita; Chief of the Engineering Section and concurrently Chief of the Technology Section: Yasushi Kichikawa. (4) Other detailed items will be instructed separately. After Honjo issued the above proclamation, he sent Major General Ninomiya, the commander of the military police, to visit Zang Shiyi and others who were under house arrest, ordering them to place the security regiment under the jurisdiction of the county magistrate under the mayor's administration. Zang replied that the implementation of the municipal system was acceptable, but he hoped that Japan would use the Chinese side's security agency for security purposes and not summon a separate group of police to be under the mayor's jurisdiction. Ninomiya was displeased with Zang's response and left. The Japanese originally planned to implement the municipal system on the 24th, and to hold office at the Shenyang Municipal Office. At the same time, the Fengtian Military and Political Department was established (some say Military and Political Office), with Honjo Shigeru as the head, taking all the military and civilian power of Liaoning into his hands. Later, due to the unfavorable international atmosphere since the 22nd, there was talk of postponing the municipal and military systems.</p>
<p>Disturbances in Shenyang: When Shenyang was suddenly invaded by the Japanese troops, news here was cut off and the truth was unclear. It was once rumored that Zang Shiyi and Rong Zhen were killed. According to those who escaped from Shenyang, Rong Zhen, Wang Yizhe and Huang Xiansheng received news in advance and fled to Xinmin, and the troops were also transferred to the Xinmin Faku area. Zang Shiyi did not have time to escape and was detained by the Japanese troops. Zhang Jinghui, the chief of the special administrative region, was also under house arrest. At present, people inside and outside Shenyang City are panicked, and all shops are closed. There is a severe shortage of food. The poor, unable to obtain food, gathered in front of the grain shops and made a commotion. The Japanese troops actually used machine guns to sweep the crowd, causing numerous deaths and injuries. The Japanese troops also stationed many posts along the streets, searching pedestrians. The Japanese troops would shoot anyone who spoke to each other on the road. Li Yi, the magistrate of Shenyang County, requested the Japanese side to allow the establishment of a self-defense regiment, recruiting 600 police officers to maintain law and order. With the permission of the Japanese side, it was established on the 22nd. However, the Japanese side did not allow them to carry weapons, but only ordered each person to wear a wooden stick and stand on the street to maintain order. The Japanese troops currently stationed in Shenyang City consist of two regiments. The rest have headed north. The two regiments are stationed in the city and outside the city: (1) A part of the 16th Regiment is stationed at the Dongda Camp Arsenal, (2) The 29th Regiment is stationed in the city, (3) A part of the 16th Regiment is stationed in the commercial port area, (4) The 29th Regiment is stationed in the Manchurian Railway Affiliated Area. There are also 80 military police officers, distributed to (1) the East City Detachment, commanded by Captain Matsuura, with the team headquarters set up in the former Palace Telegraph Administration Office, responsible for the security of the city, (2) the City Detachment, commanded by Captain Yamamoto, with the team headquarters set up in the detective office outside Xiaoxibianmen, responsible for the security of the commercial port area, (3) Shanya, the chief of the Fengtian military police detachment, commanded 600 Chinese self-defense police, guarding various parts of the city. After the arsenal was occupied, the usable internal machinery was transported elsewhere by the Japanese troops, and the heavy machinery was blown up. Of the 60 aircraft in the Aviation Department, 20 were newly purchased from the United States and the price had not yet been paid. The Japanese troops wanted to transport them away, but the US consulate knew about it and sent personnel to insert flags and guard them, preventing them from being moved. For the remaining 40 aircraft, the Japanese troops inspected those that were usable and painted the Rising Sun emblem on them, flying around the city and outside the city as a demonstration. The experimental workshop of the College of Science of Northeastern University was bombed by the Japanese soldiers, and personnel were sent to the school to instruct them to hold classes, with all expenses borne by them. However, the students were extremely angry and had all fled.</p>
<p>Course of the Occupation of Jilin: The 19th and 20th Divisions of the Japanese troops stationed in Korea mobilized from Pyongyang on the 19th. When the advance unit, the 77th Regiment, passed through Andong, it occupied Andong. On the 20th, it passed through Fushun and reoccupied Fushun. Half of a battalion of the local army was disarmed, and the rest retreated elsewhere. Benxihu was also occupied. All the larger cities along the Anfeng Line were occupied. After the 19th Division entered Liaoning, the 2nd Division moved north. Division Commander Tamon arrived in Changchun early on the 22nd, and the division headquarters was moved there. At 7:00 that morning, two trains of soldiers, led by Brigadier General Taniya, carrying two infantry regiments and one artillery regiment, advanced along the Jichang Road. At 6:00 p.m., they arrived at Jilin Station. When the merchants in the city heard that the Japanese troops had arrived, they were all panicked and closed their doors. At the same time, a Japanese plane circled in the sky and dropped a bomb at Jilin Station, destroying the ticket office. The explosion was very loud, and people were even more frightened. Many people fled to the countryside. At 7:30 p.m., the Japanese troops entered the city and confiscated the police's firearms, ordering them to maintain order on the ground with their bare hands. Taniya's brigade headquarters was also set up in the Deputy Commander's Office of the Border Defense. Since yesterday, news from Jilin has been cut off, and the situation is unknown. On the evening of the 21st, a division of Japanese troops occupied Longjing Village, Hunchun, Helong, Wangqing, and other areas. Jixing Brigade had retreated to Dongning. The Japanese troops used airplanes to bomb the Juzi Street in Longjing Village, causing great destruction. A part of the army had advanced toward Jilin along the Tiantu Road. Several thousand Koreans transported railway materials, stopping at Huining, and actively built the Jihui Railway under the cover of the Japanese troops. It was heard that Changtu, Taonan, and Liaoyuan had also been occupied by the Japanese troops one after another on the 22nd. The Sidao Road was temporarily managed by more than 100 personnel sent by the Manchurian Railway. Fearing that the Japanese troops would advance along the Taoang Road, which was connected to the Sidao Road, a section of the track was dismantled to prevent them from advancing. Today, it was heard that the Japanese troops are gradually concentrating in Changchun. Judging by their appearance, they may occupy Harbin within a day or two.</p>
<p>Harbin is in extreme danger. The Japanese troops' occupation of Changchun has caused great shock in Harbin. Today (the 23rd), a Japanese plane came to Yaomen on the Hachang Line and circled for a long time before leaving. Yaomen is only 300 *li* from Harbin and can be reached in four hours by express train, so people are even more panicked. The rumors were most rampant last night, with some saying that the Japanese troops would enter the streets soon. At the same time, bombs were said to have been found at the Japanese Consulate, the Korean Bank, the residence of the chief of the intelligence agency, and the Harbin *Nichinichi Shimbun*. The main gate stone of the Korean Bank was damaged, and several frames of type were destroyed at the Harbin *Nichinichi Shimbun*. The glass of the consulate and the residence of the chief of the intelligence agency were shattered, but the explosion was indeed very loud and heard throughout the city, so everyone was in a state of unease. The military and police authorities imposed martial law after 10:00 p.m., and all the police were armed and dispatched. This morning passed peacefully, and people were slightly relieved. However, today the Japanese troops are concentrating in Gongzhuling, and there is talk of heading north. At the same time, the Kason Mixed Brigade of the Japanese troops stationed in Korea has advanced to Liaoning, and the 19th Division has moved to Changchun, so it is rumored that the Japanese troops will arrive in Harbin within a day or two. Tonight, 300 Japanese men and women in Harbin were sent back to their country by the Japanese Consulate. Another group will return to their country tomorrow. Those who have not left are armed and live in the Zhengjin Bank and the police branch office on Maibai Street. Electric nets were set up and sandbags were piled up inside the South Manchurian Electric Company, and the precautions were as if facing a great enemy. (Evening of the 23rd)</p>

<p>Changsha Dispatch: The people of Hunan Province are extremely indignant at the Japanese troops' trampling on the three northeastern provinces. In addition to organizing propaganda teams to give lectures and strictly implement economic severance, all sectors observed a moment of silence at noon on the 23rd. Today (the 25th) morning, a "Hunan People's Demonstration against the Japanese Military Occupation of Liaoning" was held on the grounds of the Provincial Education Association. All shops in the city were closed, factories were shut down, and schools were suspended. Everyone gathered in teams at 10:00 a.m., with more than 200 groups and about 100,000 people. First, Chairman Hu Yiru reported on the meaning of the meeting and the course of the Japanese troops' atrocities. He said that the number of people attending the meeting today is large and the order is solemn, which is unprecedented. From this, it can be seen that the hearts of the people of the country have not yet died. From now on, we should unanimously eliminate private opinions, concentrate our strength, and prepare everything to fight to the death with Japanese imperialism. In addition, more than ten people including Lei Zhuo Huan, Kang Yi, Ruan Zilin, Zhou Naiji, Zhou Tianpu, and Wei Zhenbang gave speeches one after another. They were all filled with indignation, and the atmosphere was extremely tragic. Then, the presidium proposed ten motions, which were read out one by one on the spot and passed unanimously. At the same time, it was moved to cancel the Hunan Aid Overseas Chinese Association and change it to the Hunan People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. The passed motions were prepared in memorials, and representatives were sent to request the Party and government organs to accept them. Miu Kunshan and Chen Jieshi were immediately appointed to go to the Provincial Government, Wei Zhenbang and Zhou Naiji to the Fourth Route General Headquarters, and Zhou Tianpu and Tang Gan to the Provincial Party Headquarters to negotiate. Then, shouting slogans, they set off on a parade in the order of signing in. Because there were too many people, the route was changed. Starting from East Street of the Education Association, passing through Shuifengjing, turning onto Zhongshan Road, going straight down Fuxing Street, Xichang Street, Taiping Street, Fusheng Street, Pozi Street, Lubianjing, Lijiapo, Xueyuan Street, Nanzheng Street, Hongpailou, Bajiaoting, Zoumalou, Fuzheng Street, Laozhaobi, and Youyicun, returning to the Education Association Ping. It was already after 2:00 p.m. when the meeting was adjourned. The petition to the Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Headquarters is recorded as follows: "Japanese imperialists are taking advantage of our country's troubles to forcibly occupy Liaoning, advance into Tianjin and Shandong, and have the intention of driving straight in. Their secret plans and conspiracies did not originate overnight, and our indecision and misgovernment have caused trouble in peacetime. What our people are most confused about is that the nest is in danger, but the beans are still fried. Disaster is imminent, and who still has lungs and liver? There is no greater hatred than national demise, and no greater sorrow than the death of the heart. Today, what grudges cannot be resolved, what political views cannot be sacrificed? In the face of foreign aggression, private grievances should be released. We should work together in difficult times and share weal and woe. We are frightened by the collapse of China and worried about the safety of the country. The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every citizen. The people are indignant and the popular sentiment is boiling. Therefore, at 9:00 a.m. on the 25th of this month, the Hunan People's Demonstration against the Japanese Military Occupation of Liaoning was held on the grounds of the Provincial Education Association. 200,000 people attended the meeting. After deliberation by the whole body, 1. Send a telegram to all countries in the world and the International League to expose the Japanese conspiracy and announce the Japanese atrocities. 2. Send a telegram to the Central Government to issue a clear order to implement conscription. 3. Send a telegram to the Central Government to actively prepare for war against Japan. 4. Send a telegram to Committee Member Hu Zhantang to cancel his leave and jointly maintain national affairs. 5. Send a telegram to all generals in the country to unanimously support Commander-in-Chief Chiang to unify the military and unanimously oppose foreign countries. 6. Send a telegram to persuade Guangdong to break down prejudices, support the Central Government, and unanimously oppose foreign countries. 7. Send a telegram to the whole country to strictly implement economic severance with Japan. 8. Send a telegram to all agencies, shops and factories in the country to not employ Japanese people. 9. Organize a national salvation volunteer army as the government's backing. 10. Send a telegram to all Chinese people serving in Japanese public and private places in the country to automatically withdraw within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The case has been publicly decided and should be implemented unanimously. This association vows to lead the 30 million people of Changsha, Hunan, in photographing the anti-Japanese conference.</p>
<p>With the will to fight against the enemy together and the spirit of saving the country with iron and blood, we will fight bravely, the doctrine will prevail, be the government's backing, be the people's vanguard, and in addition to submitting separately, we should prepare a document stating the facts and submit it to your government for review and assistance, and earnestly ask for separate transfer to the Central Government and order it to be implemented throughout the country, and it is to the point of being unable to wait to be instructed.

<p>Unanimously resolved to send a telegram requesting a declaration of war against Japan</p>
<p>And telegram to Guangdong to end the dispute and jointly relieve the national crisis</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Since Japan relied on its strength to occupy Liaoning and Jilin, the people of Jiangxi Province have been very indignant, and the anti-Japanese national salvation atmosphere has become tense. Students from schools such as Zhicheng have organized national salvation volunteer armies, posting large slogans of "Pray to die in battle and not be a slave to a subjugated country." All the students from schools such as No. 1 Middle School wear black gauze with the inscription "Engrave it in your heart and swear to save the country" to show their determination to taste bitterness. The business community has also automatically eliminated Japanese goods to economically strangle Japan. The number of military requests to attack Japan is increasing daily. Generals such as Luo Lin sent another telegram to the Central Government yesterday, requesting a prompt order for mobilization to avenge the dead compatriots in Northeast China. According to military sources, provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Gansu, and Shaanxi will soon issue a joint telegram of anti-Japanese national salvation and volunteering to serve. The anti-Japanese national salvation demonstration of the citizens of this city was held on the morning of the 26th at the public sports field. On that day, in addition to flying flags at half-mast throughout the city, all sectors closed down for one day. Therefore, starting from 7:00 a.m., schools, business groups, and Party headquarters at all levels were holding flags and forming teams, carrying small flags to participate. The crowd was as vast as the sea, like a tidal wave. The lecture teams of the schools were also dispatched in full force. The automobile propaganda team drove around the roads, distributing propaganda materials. Aircraft Nos. 107 and 205 dispatched by the Aviation Department soared into the sky, and the leaflets scattered like heavy snow. The entire city was also extremely excited. At 10:00 a.m., various mass organizations arrived one after another, standing in the hot sun in their designated locations, with no less than 100,000 people. Liu Zuozhou of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Jia Guoen of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wang Jingxin of the Anti-Japanese Association, Zeng Jialin of the business community, Huang Yuncen of the labor community, Liao Zongyu of the student community, and Luo Junqiang of the General Headquarters were elected as the presidium, with Liu Zuozhou as the chairman. After the meeting, the entire body observed three minutes of silence for the compatriots who were killed in Northeast China. Liu reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying that today is the city's entire citizens' tragic and indignant anti-Japanese national salvation conference, because Japanese imperialists never knew what humanity and justice were, and only knew how to seize by violence. They cut off our Ryukyu Islands, took our Taiwan, annexed our Korea, and then forced us to recognize the Twenty-One Demands. Recently, they massacred our overseas Chinese in Korea, still thinking it was not enough, and sent troops into the three northeastern provinces for no reason, determined to destroy China with its thousands of years of history. Now, the Japanese soldiers are tyrannical, and disaster is imminent, so today we are holding this conference to rise up and seek survival together to save the country, and so on. Next, Wang Jingxin of the Anti-Japanese Association, Zeng Jialin of the business community, and Jiang Xiesheng of the Boy Scouts gave speeches one after another. All of them wept bitterly, and the listeners had the feeling of "I will die with you." After the speeches, seven motions were discussed and passed one by one: (1) Send a telegram of condolence to the compatriots who were killed in Northeast China. (2) Send a telegram to the International League to announce the Japanese atrocities. (3) Send a telegram to the Guangdong authorities to support the Central Government and unanimously attack Japan. (4) Send a telegram to the whole country to support Commander-in-Chief Chiang, unify military power, and implement a declaration of war against Japan. (5) Send a telegram to Mr. Hu Hanmin to cancel his leave and take charge of affairs together to relieve the national crisis, and send a telegram to the whole country to urge him to do so. (6) Send a telegram to the Central Government to withdraw the punishment of Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting. (7) Send a telegram to the Japanese proletarian parties, uphold justice, and unanimously oppose their government's aggression and atrocities to maintain peace in East Asia. All of the above cases have been resolved and handed over to the conference secretariat for handling. After the cases were passed, the teams were formed to set off on a parade. The first guide was military music, followed by boy scouts from various elementary schools, followed by students and various industry groups, followed by Party headquarters at all levels, and the rear was guarded by military police. The 100,000 marchers were several *li* long, all marching in neat steps and orderly manner, passing through Huanhu, Zhongshan, and Desheng roads, and shouted slogans along the way in unison, "Down with Japanese imperialism," "Demand that the government declare war against Japan," "Implement economic severance with Japan." The sound shook the roofs, and it did not disperse until about 2:00 p.m. (The 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Another Tragedy on the Beining Railway <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Seize Guns from Escort Guards and Railway Police</p>
<p>Major Train Robbery Occurs West of Rao Yang River</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: Yesterday, another tragedy unfolded on the Guanwai section of the Beining Railway, surpassing the severity of those in recent days. At approximately 12:35 PM yesterday, the Beining Railway passenger train No. 102, heading west from the Huanggu Tun station, was suddenly attacked by a group of bandits along the track west of the Rao Yang River. The bandits opened fire on the locomotive, seemingly aiming to injure the driver. The driver accelerated to full speed, but near the 24th signal cabin, the track had been dismantled for five sections, causing the train to derail. The water tender overturned, the baggage car lay north of the track, and the locomotive and dining car fell south of the track. The first and second-class cars that derailed collided and arched upwards, suffering the most damage. The third-class cars completely derailed and landed on the sleepers. The locomotive had two drivers and three firemen; one driver was injured, and the other four were missing, possibly crushed under the water tender. Due to the wreckage, it was impossible to investigate. A British Indian man in the second-class car was killed in the collision. In the guard's car, the father of a certain railway employee was shot dead by the bandits. Refugees from Shenyang have been fleeing for days, so there were few passengers on the train this time. All of them were transported to Dahu Shan by a train sent by the Beining Railway. Among the first-class passengers were two Italian men and two Dutch men and women, one German woman, and one British Indian man; the deceased in the second-class car was the brother of the British Indian passenger in first class. After the incident, these six foreigners were intercepted by Japanese armored cars. Seeing the train derail, the bandits swarmed onto the train. Their weapons were new and effective, rarely seen among ordinary bandits. After boarding, they searched passengers for valuables, carrying them off the train. They also selected several laborers from the passengers to carry their stolen goods before leaving the railway. Upon receiving the report, the Railway Bureau quickly dispatched eighty railway police officers from Dahu Shan to pursue the bandits. Troop trains from the 19th Brigade also arrived at Dahu Shan, awaiting orders to proceed. Simultaneously, Japanese soldiers dispatched an armored train from Huanggu Tun to the scene. By the time the train arrived, the bandits had dispersed, taking only the six foreigners. They did not rescue the remaining passengers. The armored train retreated first. After the Railway Bureau's rescue train arrived, Japanese soldiers brought the foreigners they had taken to board the rescue train and return to Huanggu Tun. By the time the railway police arrived, the bandits were long gone, making pursuit impossible. It has been investigated that within the three hundred or so miles between Dahu Shan and Shenyang, there have been repeated machine-gun and bombing attacks by Japanese aircraft in recent days. Japanese troops also seized firearms from escort guards and railway police. The railway police officer Fan of Train No. 103 was bound and detained by Japanese troops for half a day, only to be released after being stabbed multiple times in the face with bayonets, destroying his eyebrows and eyes. Consequently, within three hundred miles east of Dahu Shan, the railway police dare not use armed patrols, leaving the bandits unchecked and causing this tragedy. The Railway Bureau was ordered to expedite the repair of the damaged track and resume normal operations. However, the overturned cars are difficult to recover, so a temporary road will be built as a substitute. It is expected to be passable within the next day or two. The derailment of passenger train No. 102 yesterday blocked all incoming and outgoing trains, preventing further incidents. Japanese troops arriving at Juliu River have reached two hundred men, setting up artillery on the east mountain of Juliu River. A Japanese interpreter claimed to the Juliu River stationmaster the other day that the Japanese army had buried an electric mine under the No. 59 railway bridge east of Juliu River to defend against Chinese troops. Japanese troop trains entered the Juliu River station without the permission of the Beining Railway. The Railway Bureau's Transportation Director, a British man named Mr. Stealey, lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Consul in Shenyang on the 24th, but had not yet received a response as of yesterday. Mr. Stealey also protested to the Japanese Consul regarding the shooting of trains by Japanese aircraft on the 24th and 25th. The Japanese Consul replied that the Japanese army had not engaged in shooting trains and requested Mr. Stealey to provide evidence of Japanese aircraft shooting trains. Yesterday, Mr. Stealey specially transported the bodies of passengers killed by Japanese</p>

<p>aircraft to Huanggu Tun, taking photos as evidence. Mr. Stealey's first protest letter is as follows: "Sir, I am instructed by the director to lodge a serious protest with your consulate regarding the deployment of two Japanese military trains carrying troops and weapons to the Juliu River and Xinmin stations last night (i.e., the evening of the 23rd). A Japanese officer contacted me, requesting permission for two military trains to proceed to the Juliu River along our railway line. This train was already on our railway line outside Huanggu Tun station. I immediately replied that this could not be done and that I would telegraph the director to ask for instructions and reply promptly. The officer and other accompanying officers and soldiers then left without my permission, and the train proceeded to Juliu River and Xinmin, setting up artillery on the Juliu River platform, while the armored train remained at Xinmin East Station. Accordingly, I request your Consul-General to promptly forward the protest of the Beining Railway authorities to the Japanese Commander-in-Chief." (27th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Liaoning Provincial Government to be Temporarily Established in Jinzhou <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Communication: Following the announcement of Mi Chunlin's appointment as Acting Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government, preparations for organization are underway in Beiping. Simultaneously, the Deputy Commander's Headquarters has also designated specialists to investigate the Shenyang government officials who have sought refuge in Beiping. The current members of the Liaoning Provincial Government in Beiping include Xing Tulin, Huang Xiansheng, Peng Jiqun, and Zhang Zhenlu. The remaining are yet to be known. Officials from various provincial government agencies began reporting yesterday and are scheduled to depart for Jin County today or tomorrow with the former provincial committee members in Beiping to establish the provincial government's administrative office. All supplies are being procured in Beiping by Huang Jianqiu, who is rushing to complete them by last night. It is rumored that Zhu Guangmu will also travel to Jin County on the same train to discuss everything with Zhang Zuoxiang.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at eleven o'clock, I visited Mi Chunlin, the Acting Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government. I was granted an audience. According to Mr. Mi, he received the order to act as chairman the other night and immediately began preparations. Currently, the four committee members, Xing, Zhang, Peng, and Huang, are all in Beiping and will proceed to Jin County in the next few days to establish the provincial government. Mr. Mi stated that he would postpone his departure to handle some remaining affairs at the arsenal. The number of secretaries and other staff below the department chiefs in the provincial government in Beiping is currently under investigation and not yet fully known. The areas of Liaoning Province that have been occupied need not be discussed. The security and finances of the counties that have not been occupied by the Japanese army urgently need to be managed to sustain the livelihood of the people. Therefore, after the establishment of the provincial government, the Finance Department and the Police Department will be established first. Department Chief Zhang (Zhenlu) and Director Huang (Xiansheng) are both former officials and will find it easier to handle. The organization of the Shenyang municipal government will be postponed for the time being. Chairman Zhang (Zuoxiang) is still in Jin County overseeing everything and plans to make a trip to Jilin. Yu Zhen has also been released and returned home, etc. Next, I inquired about the current state of the arsenal. He said that because the factory stores ammunition, it cannot move guns, so there was no resistance. There were many Japanese engineers in the factory, so the takeover was peaceful. If it had caused an explosion of ammunition, Shenyang would not have been safe, so neither side opened fire. Currently, the finished products stored in the factory have all been transported away by the Japanese army. (27th)</p>

<p>Fraudulent Investigation of Enemy Goods Exposed: Ye Songzhi, a resident outside the north gate of this county, recently encountered Wang Yizhou, an Yixing native claiming to be a clerk from the Construction Bureau, who stated that Shoupin Zhi had filed a complaint alleging encroachment on the official river and that he was specially ordered to investigate and respond. After speaking, he left. The Ye family then inquired at the Construction Bureau and learned that the bureau had no clerk named Wang, nor was there any complaint filed. There was no case of the director ordering an investigation. They were instructed to pay attention. Later, someone informed Ye that the case could be resolved by giving two hundred yuan. Ye feigned acceptance and scheduled the delivery for yesterday morning. At the appointed time, Wang arrived as scheduled. Ye first handed over five ten-yuan banknotes from the Bank of China, promising to pay the balance later. Ye waited until Wang put the banknotes into his pocket before sending someone to summon the police, who arrested Wang Yizhou, who was extorting money under a false name, and brought him to the First Sub-Precinct of the Public Security Bureau. Ye stated that the banknotes were all stamped with overlapping seals, with the numbers recorded, and could be verified. After the banknotes and official documents were found on Wang's person and confirmed to be authentic, Wang Yizhou confessed that his real name was Zhou Yuqing, that he was falsely working as a secretary on the highway, and that he had been fooled for a moment. He begged for leniency. He was immediately sent to the main bureau for preliminary interrogation and a document was prepared to transfer him to the prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>Inspection of Enemy Goods Measures: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee of this county held its second committee meeting yesterday (28th) to discuss matters. Recently, the committee received reports that many shops in the city were secretly importing Japanese goods. The question was how to handle this matter. It was resolved to designate registration forms and send them to the Chamber of Commerce for distribution. All daily postal packages must be inspected before distribution. Personnel will be dispatched daily to inspect stations and wharves, first establishing a postal inspection team with four members each, filled by directors and members of the inspection division. The case of Zhuang Hongda secretly importing Japanese goods will be thoroughly investigated by Zhang Yiyun, a member of the Standing Committee of the committee, together with Dai Kunpei, director of the inspection division, before further action is taken.</p>

It was definitely an ancient building, but it had been dug into two sections. The starting and ending points were still in the mountains and had not been excavated. Whether it was an ancient tomb or a Liao Dynasty road was impossible to determine due to the soil cover. As the matter concerns an ancient building, whether it is subject to the Ancient Artifacts Protection Law and whether it is necessary to preserve it was specially reported to the county for review yesterday (29th).</p>

<p>Teachers, students, and others from National Central University, upon hearing the bad news of Japan's sudden dispatch of troops and invasion of our country's Northeast territory, were extremely indignant. The entire body of teachers and all students organized the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and actively engaged in anti-Japanese activities. At seven o'clock in the morning on the 28th, a plenary meeting was held in the auditorium of the university, deciding to petition the Central Party Department, the National Government, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and deciding to request the following eight points, all of which were passed unanimously. After the adjournment, Professor He Haoruo, the chairman of the meeting, led the procession. At nine o'clock, they arrived at the Central Party Department, where representatives entered to petition. The entire mass stood solemnly in good order. Subsequently, Committee Member Ding Weifen responded in the rain, and the procession continued to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The ranks gathered outside the door, and representatives were elected to visit Foreign Minister Wang. Because Foreign Minister Wang hid and refused to meet, the public sentiment was even more aroused. The number of people was extremely crowded, and the place was narrow, resulting in conflicts with Foreign Minister Wang. The situation at the time was quite tense. Finally, Commander-in-Chief He Haoruo led the entire group to the National Government to petition. The road was drenched with heavy rain, but the procession remained extremely orderly. After arriving at the National Government, Chairman Jiang and Dean Yu received them, resulting in a very satisfactory outcome. The entire group returned to school at twelve thirty. It is heard that the university's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association will continue to actively pursue its activities, vowing to fight the Japanese imperialists to the end. The eight points requested are as follows: (1) Request the government to immediately facilitate peaceful unification. (2) Request the government to issue an ultimatum to Japan and actively prepare for war. (3) Request the government to dismiss Wang Zhengting. (4) Request the government to clearly order the restoration of the popular movement. (5) Request the government to earnestly implement national military training.

Suddenly, other elements joined along the way, resulting in a noisy crowd. When arriving at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the order suddenly broke down, resulting in insults to Minister Wang and damage to public property of the ministry. Upon hearing the news, Jiahua was extremely terrified. As the principal, Jiahua's handling was inadequate, resulting in this unfortunate incident, and he should bear all responsibility. Accordingly, I respectfully request your department to approve my dismissal and impose a severe punishment. I am waiting urgently for your order. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Education, Zhu Jiahua, Principal of National Central University.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Extension of Approval for Private Middle School Registration in Beiping Approved <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Until the Day Before the Start of the Second Semester of the 20th Year</p>
<p>The Beiping Municipal Education Bureau previously submitted to the Ministry of Education, stating that the Ministry of Education's order regarding the deadline for the registration of six private schools, schools above the college level, was extended to the end of January of the 20th year, and schools below the middle school level, except for provinces and cities where the registration procedures were nearing completion, should follow the previous order and be handled by the competent departments to determine the extension period and submit it for approval, but it could not be delayed beyond the end of June of the 21st year. Furthermore, private schools that have been registered should be managed conscientiously, and newly established schools should not recruit students without authorization before being approved for establishment, and violators should be dealt with according to regulations, etc. However, it has been found that this city is a cultural center, and there are many private schools below the middle school level. Some have already followed the regulations and applied for registration, but there are still many that have not registered. Moreover, due to military transportation interruptions last year, the Ministry of Education's instructions were not known until March of this year. Although urged, review and correction would take time, and it may be difficult to complete the procedures on schedule. If they are terminated upon expiration, there will inevitably be regrets. It is proposed to request approval for an extension until the day before the start of the second semester of the 20th year to facilitate supervision and management. The Ministry of Education instructed that the submission be noted and handled as proposed.</p>

<h3 id="e85">County Education Bureau Meeting <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau held its 128th bureau affairs meeting yesterday. Those in attendance were Bureau Chief Shi, Supervisor Zhu, Zheng Zhai, Yang Huiming, Lin Wenwen, Niu Zhiyi, Ling Sansheng, Qian Zhonghou, and Yan Chongguang. The meeting was chaired by Bureau Chief Shi and recorded by Ling Sansheng. After the formalities, the following items were reported: (1) The county government, based on the second district chief's request to waive tuition fees, forwarded the matter for deliberation and reply. It was resolved that the budget for the 20th year had already been established, and the county's total tuition income was over seven thousand yuan. Waiving the fees would make it impossible for the bureau to raise funds to compensate, making it difficult to comply. (2) The tenant of the two-story building in Qiuwei, Zhang Ming, has been in arrears of rent for eleven months and has repeatedly failed to pay despite reminders. What should be done? It was resolved that he should pay the arrears by the end of the month; otherwise, the building will be taken back and rented to someone else. (3) The County Education Association requested the establishment of an Education Achievement Exhibition Room. It was resolved that preparations would be made after the relocation of the government. (4) In the past, parental education funds in each district were received and distributed by the Education Committee together with the district chiefs. However, at the end of the year, incomplete receipts caused difficulties in preparing the final accounts. How should this be handled? It was resolved that, in addition to informing the Education Committees, the county government should instruct the district chiefs to submit the receipts from each school for the previous month when coming to the bureau to receive their funds in the future, before they can receive the funds for the current month. The meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Details of the Petition to Chiang in Beijing <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Chiang Expresses that the Central Government Will Absolutely Not Let Down the Nation</p>
<p>Dai Jitao Says the Government Bears Full Responsibility</p>
<p>Riri News Agency reports: The Shanghai University Students Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation's petition delegation, totaling representatives from various universities in Shanghai, boarded a train on the evening of the 25th of this month to go to Beijing to petition for five demands, including punishing diplomatic officials and Northeast military personnel, issuing firearms to students, and declaring war on Japan. They received satisfactory replies from Chairman Chiang of the National Government and President Dai Jitao. They have now returned to Shanghai and yesterday reported in detail to Riri News Agency reporters about their petition. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>This trip involved a delegation of 56 people from 26 schools. They departed from Shanghai at 11:30 PM on the 25th, arrived in Beijing at 8:00 AM on the 26th, and stayed at National Central University. At 10:30 AM that morning, they went to the National Government to petition. They met Chairman Chiang in the auditorium, who gave them satisfactory answers to the five demands. The discussion lasted for two hours before they left. On the morning of the 27th, they went to the Central Party Headquarters, where they were received by Minister Chen Lifu. In the afternoon, they visited the mausoleum and hosted reporters. In the evening, they visited Hu Hanmin. On the morning of the 28th at 7:00 AM, they decided to return to Shanghai. At 9:00 AM that morning, they attended the Central Party Headquarters' memorial week. They met Dai Jitao in the first conference room of the Central Party Headquarters, who, on behalf of the Central Government, responded to the students' demands. In the afternoon, they boarded a train and arrived in Shanghai at midnight yesterday.</p>
<p>Chiang's Expression: Chairman Chiang's address to the Shanghai university students stated briefly that the students did not seem to fully understand the government, but it was necessary to know that the government was actively working to deal with the Japanese. When the students asked Chiang to respond to the five demands, Chiang addressed the first demand, to declare war on Japan, by saying that when there was absolutely no possibility of peace, troops would ultimately have to be sent to fight to the death. Regarding the second demand, to punish Wang Zhengting, he replied that diplomatic failures should be the full responsibility of the government and not the responsibility of one person. Regarding the third demand, to order Zhang Xueliang to quickly reclaim the lost territory and atone for his crimes, he replied that the student representatives did not need to worry about this point and that the Central Government would certainly have to take back the territory, while atonement for his crimes was a matter for the future. Regarding the fourth demand, to issue firearms to students, he replied that there was a shortage of firearms in the country and that for every firearm a student had, a soldier would have one less. Therefore, it was difficult to do so for the time being. In the future, at the appropriate time, students would certainly be able to obtain firearms. Now, they could concentrate on receiving military training. The Central Government did not want students to go to war because students were the knowledgeable youth of the country and would be the pillars of the country in the future. If all the students sacrificed themselves for the country, this kind of loss would be extremely significant. The government would not send students out to defend the country unless it was absolutely necessary. Regarding the fifth demand, not to sign treaties that forfeit rights and humiliate the country and to make diplomacy public, Chiang replied that this was even more the Central Government's responsibility. The Central Government must take the will of the people as its will, and diplomacy should also be absolutely public.</p>
<p>Dai's Expression: When the student delegation went to petition, Dai Jitao also responded to the five demands one by one, stating briefly that diplomatic failures were the responsibility of the government and that the government would not fail the expectations of the people. The government would never use diplomacy to seek personal gain. Chen Lifu also gave earnest advice to the students, which the student representatives considered satisfactory, and they then returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin's Remarks: Hu Hanmin was ill at home. The representatives went to his home to present their cards and request an audience. Hu was upstairs due to his illness, fearing exposure to the cold. He could not come out to see them, so he asked the representatives to enter his bedroom. Hu said that the occurrence of this incident was planned by the Japanese beforehand and was not accidental. He was still seriously ill and had not yet recovered, so it was difficult for him to come out of retirement for the time being. However, he would still devote himself to national affairs and would immediately report any methods to the Central Government for adoption. Hu also encouraged the students to implement economic severance with Japan in the future. The youth themselves should also pay attention to organization and propaganda.</p>

<p>The Chinese Vocational Guidance Organization Federation recently made the following declaration: Against reason and abandoning justice, violating the Kellogg-Briand Pact, advancing troops into the eastern provinces, and brutally killing our national compatriots. The whole country is filled with sorrow and anger, and the world is holding grievances. Our colleagues in the education sector are deeply saddened by this national crisis. In the aftermath of pain, they should plan self-rescue and save the country. It is generally believed that this association is a vocational guidance group. The establishment of round arguments emphasizes the promotion of spiritual education, the cultivation of strength, attention to production education, and the enrichment of people's livelihoods as two major guidelines. Regarding the main surface of production education, the complete implementation of economic severance, the increase of national production, and the perpetual non-use of Japanese goods are the main purposes, in order to resist brutal Japan and develop the people's livelihood as the fundamental plan. Current work (1) Investigate the types, quantities, and values ​​of imported Japanese goods. (2) Investigate whether there are domestic goods that can replace the above-mentioned Japanese goods, what factory produces the domestic goods, and what is the value. (3) Establish domestic goods exhibition halls or domestic goods markets in various places, and display Japanese goods next to each domestic goods for comparison. (4) Based on the investigation results, engage in the creation and improvement of domestic goods factories. (9) Based on the results of the investigation, extensively publicize and advise on the use of domestic goods, so that all compatriots in the country will know the danger of using Japanese goods. Regarding spiritual education, 1. Young men and women should actively pay attention to physical exercise and implement military training. 2. Reject bad habits and cultivate a sound and good personality. 3. Pay attention to self-cultivation and strive for the improvement of one's own business. 4. Devote oneself to academics, research the improvement and invention of items, in order to achieve the purpose of saving the country through science. The people of the country must know that in this world where justice is not judged, it is better to seek oneself than to seek others. Relying on others is not worthwhile. At this time of national crisis, in addition to the concerted efforts of the whole country to actively prepare for war, the compatriots of all industries can only bury their heads in business, intensify their work, in order to seek the development of affairs and the increase of industry. With one point of spirit, do one point of career, more one point of work, increase one point of strength, and look forward to the compatriots of the whole country, who are usually long in serving all walks of life, and once there is a disaster, everyone will hold Ge to defend the country. If things come to this point, destruction is not far away. Today, there is absolutely no reason for our people to live in peace, compromise, or fluke. I respectfully offer it and hope you will take it into consideration.</p>

The team with the most total points is the Railway Team, which won the championship, which is rare. The runner-up is the Pleasant Team, which has never lost since the start of the competition. However, the points were not as many as the Railway Team, so it regrettably took the runner-up. The third place was a tie between the China Team and the Meilu Team. In addition to the award of the championship badge to the champion team (according to the original plan, only ten badges were awarded. Now, because the Railway Team has as many as fifteen members, the tournament staff will add five more badges according to the original badge) and a memorial flag to the runner-up team, there are also individual award methods. All individual and doubles players who have never been absent or failed (double players must never have changed partners) will be awarded a silver cup. The staff has completed the review.

Although football does not have a great reputation, since the National Association has had football joint competitions, the association has never been interrupted or abandoned from beginning to end. The spirit is commendable. Since Jin Feng has been sending refreshing winds recently, the opportunity to play football is here again. Upon the proposal of Mr. Hong Zunsan, Mei Zifan, and Wang Dekang, the association plans to recruit 20 football talents this year to practice at the football field every morning and practice physical fitness. All young people who have aspirations for sports are welcome to participate in the report show. Yu Jun's office is located at No. 141 Guizhou Road, north of Nanjing Road.

<p>Los Angeles News: Currently, all countries in the world are affected by the economic recession, resulting in economic panic in various countries. It was recently rumored that the 10th World Games, which will be held in the United States next year, may be suspended. The truth has now been clarified. This matter was proposed by Sweden because, in view of the world's situation, all countries do not have sufficient capacity to send athletes. For example, French athletes have to raise their own travel expenses. Britain and Germany are also struggling with finances and tend not to participate. Therefore, it is proposed to postpone the conference, otherwise the conference will be reduced. Sweden's proposal was subsequently supported by most European countries. However, the president of the World Sports Association, the American Foer Lanzhi, stated that Sweden's proposal will now be sent to the countries by the conference to solicit their consent. If more than half of the countries agree to the postponement, the conference must be postponed and held in the next session. However, the Los Angeles venue has been properly arranged. If the conference is postponed, the losses suffered by the United States will be indescribable.</p>

<p>Whenever I encounter an incident, I always treat it with the attitude of solving a mathematical problem, using a calm mind to guide the path of my boiling blood, so I rarely feel indignation and rarely feel pessimistic. However, since the fall of Shenyang, every time I see Zhang Xueliang's telegrams, I cannot help but feel angry. In these telegrams, all I see is the fall, withdrawal, death and injury, and disarmament, and I do not see any expression of great fearless spirit. This is cold water poured on the flames of national spirit. If you fight and are defeated, the people will forgive you. If you are defeated and fight again, the people will respect you. If you fight and are defeated, and you are defeated and do not fight, the people will one day settle accounts with you. Because what you have lost is not just land, but the spirit of establishing a country. You still have a chance to atone for your crimes. If you miss it, it is such a pity!</p>
<h3 id="e103">Poem on National Humiliation <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zhuzun</p>
<p>In the ninth month of the twentieth year, on the nineteenth day at dawn, Japanese soldiers recklessly committed violence, seizing my Fengtian City. Jilin was subsequently captured, and disaster will come to Beiping. They replaced my officials and killed my people. Bad news came from the Northeast, and the people lamented in shock. They began to wake up from their dreams, and compatriots called out to each other as brothers. Why do bean stalks hate each other? Why are they so eager to cook each other? National hatred is abandoned, and party resentment is unclear. The caller's voice is already hoarse, but who can hear? Only allowing unarmed scholars to talk about weapons on paper. Slogans are written in red and green but cannot be fought. How can cunning enemies know that troops will come to the city without declaring war? Annexing my three provinces is still called a local act. I heard that the officials of the three provinces raised many elite troops. They were said to number hundreds of thousands, allowing them to act recklessly in the Northeast. They won against Cao Wu in one fell swoop, and defeated You and Bing in the second. They annihilated the rebellious Shi in the third and played the triumph with joyful voices. The pride of China, the Great Wall of North China. How can they be plowed by enemies in a moment? Like destroying dead wood and rotten grass, like cutting fresh flesh and cooking sacrifices. Beating dogs into poor alleys, struggling to resist each other desperately. How can they be worse than dogs, retreating regardless of the distance. The central army is mighty and glorious, and the conquests are like gods. They wiped out Li Bai in one fell swoop and overthrew Feng Tang in the second. They suppressed the Red bandits in the third and then marched south. How can the central government enjoy fighting? It is necessary to protect its prestige. The general's spirit is overwhelming, how can the hundred Yue be leveled? Focusing on punishing rebels, vowing not to live under the same sky. The prestige is spread, flashing like thunder. Why do enemies come without even welcoming a soldier? The city fell for three or four days, and no angry voice was heard. Where is the credibility now? The promises are just filling the court. Recalling the things of the past, only wanting to decorate peace. Concealing the illness and avoiding medical treatment, disaster even reached this point. The country has been in decline for a long time, why wait until now to understand? The greatest thing is the death of the heart, and tears flow as I speak. The country has raised warriors for twenty years. The annual consumption is tens of millions, and there are flags everywhere. Why be afraid of public war but brave in private disputes? Years of civil strife, killings are incessant. Borrowing money to buy foreign weapons, the ambitions are all proud and arrogant. The military is divided into the sea, land, and air, and the three parties fight each other. Rivers and valleys flow with human blood, and cities and suburbs become hills. Now the war has not yet ended, what else is there to do? I fear that in a few days, it will end in a city alliance. Otherwise, the Russo-Japanese War will involve world soldiers. Death will have no burial place, how dare I hope to steal life? I wish all the people of the country would wake up from their dreams at the same time. I also wish the loyal warriors to carefully weigh the pros and cons of fortune. The country will be slaves together, and wealth is not your glory. Abandon resentment early and plan for the country's rejuvenation. I also wish the young warriors to not be frivolous in their intentions. Focus on studying knowledge and stop the sacrifice of skipping classes. Reading breaks ten thousand volumes and brings peace to the country. The past is dead yesterday, and the future is born today. Ten years of livelihood and accumulation, ten years of education and training. All studies are advanced, scholars, farmers, workers, and soldiers. Each fulfills their duties, as brothers to each other. Maybe we can wash away the national humiliation, and the bamboo slips will record our achievements. I bow my head nine times after writing the poem, please appreciate my sincerity.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The Wonderful Child on the Zhangpu Gate <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>The Ming Dynasty pirates harassed our coastal borders, and my county of Xiding was often in danger. The city was captured several times. On April 16 of the 33rd year of Jiajing, the bandits arrived in force and surrounded the county seat again. At that time, the neighboring states and counties were all invaded and had no time to save themselves. Yin Fenglin, the county magistrate, was a professor in the prefecture and served as the county magistrate. He was also panicked and did not know what to do. The scholars and people discussed and decided to divide the city walls and take self-defense measures. On the morning of that day, the bandits approached the city and plundered the countryside during the day and set fires at night. Cries of lamentation were everywhere, and corpses were piled up into burial mounds. One evening, the bandits approached the West Gate and had already climbed the city wall. The guards were sleeping soundly, so they climbed up the ladder and reached the parapet. A child saw it by chance with a lamp under the city and then shouted loudly. The crowd was startled and woke up, and they hurriedly threw stones and broke the ladder, causing the bandits to retreat. However, looking down at the child, his head had fallen to the ground, and the smell of blood touched the nose. Later, Yang Song, a Henan native, was in the county and killed hundreds of bandits successively. They held out for a month before the bandits fled. The authorities were grateful for the child's courage and bravery and the bandits' schemes and unanimously decided to carve a stone statue. When the statue was completed, it faced east and sat on the city gate. It still exists today. The West Gate is located in Zhangpu, so it is named He Pu Gate. It is a pity that the county chronicles did not record the child's surname and he became an anonymous hero. However, compared to the current invasion by the violent Japanese and the axes of the north and south, which have been sitting idly by, it is said that they own four hundred million people, advocating the overthrow of imperialism, and everyone is in the position of master, but they also allow thieves to enter the room and ransack my treasures. Then they were shocked and stunned and blamed the guards for their carelessness. Why are they not as good as the child? Alas, I can't bear to say it anymore.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Record of a Deaf Man's Lecture and Hearing <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Peichu</p>
<p>The Chinese Christian Youth Association invited Dr. Schukat to give a lecture on the evening of September 25th, titled "How to Reduce the Suffering of the Deaf." That evening, I happened to visit a friend at the Youth Association and took the opportunity to attend the lecture. I have recorded it below.</p>
<p>The Suffering of the Deaf: Schukat said, "I (Schukat referring to himself) am a researcher of philosophy, not a medical researcher. I have absolutely no understanding of the treatment of deafness. However, because I have been an elderly deaf person with decades of hearing loss, I deeply understand the suffering of the deaf, which is greater than that of the blind and mute. Although blindness is painful, everyone can tell at a glance that the person is disabled, and they cannot help but feel pity. Mutes have mouths but cannot speak, so disaster does not befall them. Deaf people, on the other hand, show no signs of disability in their appearance, and when talking to others, they often become entangled and clash in their speech, leading to insults from the other party. Sometimes, it can even stir up a major storm. Furthermore, if a deaf person is walking on the road and is unfortunately hit by a car, the driver will inevitably use excuses such as having repeatedly honked the horn and the vehicle being unable to stop in time. If it were not a deaf person, they could point out the driver's lies. At this time, the deaf person has no words to defend themselves. Is this not suffering?"</p>
<p>Organizing a Federation: The benefits that deaf people enjoy in society only account for 40% of those of ordinary people. Anything that requires hearing is not their share. Life is really very boring. The best way to remedy this is to organize a deaf federation. The federation should include a club and a job placement office. The former is for the entertainment of the deaf, and the latter is to help the deaf find a livelihood. This way, the loneliness of the deaf can be reduced.</p>
<p>Special Listening Style: Eight out of ten of the listeners that day were fellow deaf people. At first, they only cupped their hands behind their ears to aid hearing. Later, because the sound waves still could not reach their ears, they gradually left their seats and went towards the podium. Finally, all the deaf people gathered around the podium, surrounding the elderly deaf Dr. Schukat in the center. However, the deaf people still felt it was not enough and continued to cup their hands behind their ears.</p>

<p>— Xiaoke</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Gan-yi, the Master of the Dhi Xiang Studio, turned forty on the seventeenth day of the eighth lunar month. He had originally reserved seats at the Dongya Restaurant and planned to display the poems and paintings given by famous figures from the north and south in a wide hall, with a small gathering to entertain guests. However, as a great disaster was looming, he could not bear to be merry and immediately stopped the plan. He moved the funds for the banquet to disaster relief. He has linked together the five-character couplet by Mr. Yu Youren, "His literary talent startles all who sit with him," and "By not serving, he strengthens his body." And Mr. Luo Fukan's collected verse, "True strength</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Sound of Patriotic Songs in a Time of National Crisis: A Public Awareness Campaign Through Music <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Wancheng</p>
<p>"Sonification" refers to using music to inspire the people. Music can best harmonize and beautify everything in the universe. Confucius said, "Music is the harmony of the world... Harmony is why the world is transformed." Sima Qian said, "Music is that by which the pulse is moved, the spirit is circulated, and the heart is harmonized." Wilhelm II said, "Music is enough to transform the evil and decadent souls of mankind, making them pure, passionate, and increasingly upward." Beethoven said, "Sublime and great personalities, the thoughts of sages, and the achievements that cover the world can only be formed and cultivated through the refinement of music."</p>
<p>In short, "Music is the art of expressing emotion." As the saying goes, "One tragic song can move thousands to tears." In the past, when Guan Zhong assisted Duke Huan of Qi and led his troops on a distant expedition, the soldiers found it difficult to climb the steep mountain ridges. Guan Zhong composed the song "It is difficult to climb the mountain, but easy to descend." They sang it back and forth, and the sound of the song echoed through the clouds. The soldiers' extreme fatigue was relieved by the song. Also, during the Chu-Han contention, Xiang Yu was trapped at Gaixia (now southeast of Lingbi County, Anhui). Zhang Zifang's song with the flute caused the Chu army's morale to collapse. From this, it is known that music deeply inspires the masses and has the power to change personal emotions.</p>
<p>All countries in the world attach importance to "music." The United States will hold a joint conference of national musicians, poets, and writers in Chicago in 1933. The largest church in London, Truro Cathedral, recently organized a choir with over a thousand members. Also, the city of Messiah in Germany awards 300,000 marks annually to the city's top musician.</p>
<p>At this time, with the autumn air crisp and the national crisis looming, the Chinese Municipal Progressive Association held a "Public Awareness Campaign Through Music for National Salvation" on the evening of September 27th. Mr. Huang Jingwan was responsible for the preparations and invited Messrs. Miao Zhijie, Chen Gexin, and Lu Danlin to assist. There were many programs that evening.</p>
<p>The Female Doctor's Opening Speech: Dr. Qian Jianqiu, a Doctor of Law, gave the opening speech. The main idea was "The purpose of the 'Public Awareness Campaign Through Music for National Salvation' and the understanding we should have about resisting Japan and saving the nation." Her words were very alarming. Dr. Qian also attended with her mother and Dr. Huang Biying that evening.</p>
<p>Wang Qingxun Put on a Great Show: That evening, Mr. Huang Qingxun, the president of the Chinese Harmonica Association, led the Chinese Harmonica Team in singing the Party Song and led the Shanghai Provincial Middle School Harmonica Team in playing "Forward Courageously." Mr. Wang also played a harmonica solo of "Heaven and Hell" and took the opportunity to give a speech. His tone was passionate, and the listeners were moved. Mr. Wang is from Taiwan and has experienced the brutality of Japanese imperialism firsthand, and his resentment filled his chest, so he had to vent it. Then he sang generously, and the audience's spirits were boosted even more.</p>
<p>Chen Gexin Sang with Sadness: Mr. Chen Gexin, a music professor at Shanghai Girls' High School, has an excellent voice. That evening, he sang "I Hear You Calling Me" and "My Mother" solo. They were moving and sad, and his voice lingered for three days.</p>
<p>Two Girls Sang Folk Songs Together: Misses Zhang Wencan and Lin Muhao, both fourteen or fifteen years old, were of equal height. Their harmonica duet of "Siamese Folk Song" was melodious and well-paced, with a lot of expressive art.</p>
<p>There were other programs that evening. Patriotic songs were performed, and it was a grand occasion for a while. The meeting adjourned at nine o'clock.</p>
<p>Having one's character tested," "Balance and integrity can be maintained." The former is from Tao Qian, and the latter is from Cao Zhi. Mr. Sun Gongda's collection of verses from Yishan and Banshan, "Yu Chuan's articles fill five thousand scrolls," "His fame echoes across the lakes and seas for twenty years." Mr. Zhou Shoujuan's verse says, "How could it be said that he is unknown? His outstanding talent and fame startle the four seas," "This is truly one who is not confused; his literary career will last for a thousand autumns." Mr. Dong Xixiang's collection of verses from the I Ching, "Sharpening learning and encouraging practice; delight our good friends," "Increasing glory and reputation; may the governor extend his years." Mr. Xu Shuliang's verse says, "His incisive articles are filled with many works," "A full sky of bright moonlight shines on the longevity star." There are many other fine verses, which I cannot record in their entirety. The paintings include works by Messrs. Fang Yaoyu, Yang Yunshi, Huang Qiuye, Yin Bohan, Chen Yanheng, Liu Gansheng, He Qiujiang, Yao Jingfu, Shi Yitang, and Fang Xiaoling, as well as Ms. Jiangnan Ping, with pine and cypress, bamboo and peach, plum and chrysanthemum, each excelling in its own way. The poems from the north include fine verses by Messrs. Wang Shuheng, Zhang Daishan, Li Xinwu, Shen Yanqi, Xia Weiru, Chen Zhongqian, Huang Juntan, Zhu Shaotang, Cang Xiqing, Xing Yu San, and Liu Benyi. Those from the south, such as Yuan Bokui, Xia Jiancheng, Wang Jiexun, Chen Yantong, Tang Feiyu, Wang Lengzhai, Liu Manruo Yantang Kunzhong, Lu Tieshan, Huang Youmu, Fan Shiru, Cheng Yongyan, and Xia Junong, and Sun Peisheng, also contributed five-character or seven-character regulated verses. Famous lines circulate. Due to the length, they are not recorded. It is heard that the Master of the Dhi Xiang Studio will compile and publish them, leaving his mark.

<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>"No, now I have found out that the woman in the car that night was just a prostitute, and this prostitute has married someone else. This person happens to be a friend of my friend, so I know everything."</p>
<p>"Then what is the use of the woodenware he bought?"</p>
<p>"Don't be discouraged. He will definitely change his mind in the future. Not to mention anything else, like my wife, I was so discouraged before, but now..."</p>
<p>"Indeed, your wife is truly a husband's wife."</p>
<p>"So you're definitely leaving tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"Definitely leaving. Maybe I'll stay for three to five days to relax and then go back to Shanghai."</p>
<p>As Mrs. Li said this, her heart felt as if it were being cut by a knife. She reached out and shook hands with Mr. Chen, held back her tears, forced a smile, and walked back to her room.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chen did not return home all night, and Mr. Chen was very uneasy. He suspected that she might have been hit by a car on the road or that she might have relapsed into her old ways. However, he never suspected that her meekness for the past two months was a special act.</p>
<p>He pitied Mrs. Li because he dared not do anything shocking to save her, just for his own reputation and status. He also knew that Mrs. Li loved him, but she also did not have the courage to do anything shocking to remarry him. Everyone was helpless.</p>
<p>He did not close his eyes all night, lost in anxious thought. Mrs. Li also cried all night. But Mr. Li came home at two o'clock in the middle of the night, went to bed, and slept soundly, ignoring her.</p>
<p>She got up early in the morning, left a note for her husband, hurried out, and took a car to Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Not long after Mr. Chen got up, he suddenly received a letter from a lawyer. After he opened it, he was so angry that his hands trembled. It was a letter from a lawyer representing his wife, requesting a divorce from him.</p>
<p>Because the first reason stated in the letter pointed to his ambiguous relationship with Mrs. Li, he took the letter to find Mr. Li, hoping that Mr. Li could help him prove that Mrs. Li had absolutely no relationship with him.</p>
<p>But Mr. Li said lightly, "If a woman's heart changes, there is no turning back. A real man should not worry about having no wife. If she wants a divorce, then allow it. Now my wife has also left without saying goodbye, and maybe she will imitate your wife and send me a lawyer's letter. But I trust you very much and will never believe that you have anything to do with my wife." (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e109">Financial Gold Bar Price Surge Resumes <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Settlement Price to Adopt US Dollar Standard</p>
<p>Termination of Trading for Japanese Merchants</p>
<p>Price Increases by More Than Twenty-Eight Taels: Yesterday, the 29th, the price of gold bars showed a renewed upward trend. However, there were still twists and turns, with alternating winds and rains, making it difficult to control. People were confused and restless. In the morning session, the price fluctuated around 690 taels. In the afternoon session, it once exceeded the 700 tael mark, with a review of more than 21 taels. In the end, it surged by more than 28 taels, with buyers appearing to be in the majority. This was likely due to the fall in silver prices and, even more so, due to the intense fury of the Japanese bandits in the Northeast, causing people to feel exceptionally indignant and implement an economic boycott to resist them. Therefore, the gold industry will hold a meeting to discuss the adoption of the US dollar as the standard for settling the price of Japanese gold. The estimated price is around 827 taels and some change. After the method is discussed and decided, it can be implemented. This has already caused the market price to rise. The market opened high from the early morning, but although foreign exchange showed an increase, the difference was inconsistent, and the fluctuations were unpredictable. However, the price of gold had slight twists and turns, but the turbulence was not as great as the day before. The buying interest was even stronger in the afternoon session, causing the price to rise by more than ten taels, before briefly falling sharply.</p>
<p>The Market Opened with a Surge of Fifteen and a Half Taels: From the opening of the November market in the early morning, the price had already surged by fifteen and a half taels, to 691 taels. Large lots remained unchanged. Because the anticipated rebound of the previous day did not materialize and the price of American silver fell by one-eighth, people's resolve was further strengthened. Cui Changyong and the Dalian Gang, among others, all entered the market, raising the price from 90 taels to 95 and a half taels. Subsequently, due to sales by Dadecheng, Yifeng, Zhifengyong, and Yuanmaoyong, the price dropped by more than six taels. At 9:00 AM, the price was 89 taels. Almost all English gold settled at 1.7, and banks took over 0.0625. Mitsui also took over Japanese gold for November at 1 tael 5 qian 3 fen, and for October at 1 tael 5 qian 5 fen. In addition, Yongfeng, Qianchangxiang, and Da Xingyong, acting as agents for Indian merchant Qiao Zhifu, chased after the price, causing it to rise by eight taels. At 9:15 AM, the price was 97 taels. Furthermore, due to purchases by Fuyu, Yuanmaoyong, and Hengchangyong, the price fell by six taels. Moreover, English gold opened as before, but Citibank quoted 32.375. The price of Japanese gold did not move, and the price was 91 taels. Almost all English gold was issued by Zhengjin, etc., at 1.7125, so the price fell again. At 9:45 AM, the price was 86 taels 2 qian. Later, banks took over December Citibank at 32 yuan. Furthermore, Dadecheng, Yuanxingyong, and Da Xingyong, among others, competed to enter the market, causing the price to rise again by seven taels. At 10:30 AM, the price was 93 and a half taels. In a moment, it fell back by more than four taels because the Sino-Japanese bank was trading January US dollars at 32 yuan 125. Zhengjin issued English gold at 1.725. By 11:20 AM, the price was 89 taels. Afterwards, Dadecheng, Daxingyong, Yuanxingyong, and Qianchangxiang jointly bought, and Zhengjin and Holland traded December English gold at 1.25, using this to raise the price by six or seven taels. At noon, the price was 96 taels. As the market was about to close, it was heard that Indian remittances reported 8 Anna, and goods were sold, causing a slight decrease of one tael. Then the market rallied by one tael from 94 taels 8 qian, and the quoted price was still 831 taels, with an estimated drawdown of around 140 taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Re-emerged Above the 700 Tael Mark: The afternoon market opened at 97 taels and then at 96 taels. The buying interest suddenly ignited. It was estimated that Cuichangyong, Yongfeng, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, and Qianchangxiang, among others, entered the market enthusiastically, jumping ten taels. At 2:30 PM, the price was 706 taels, but among them, there was a difference of one or two taels in the high and low. Zhengjin issued English gold for January at 1.70625 and took over Japanese gold at 1 tael 5 qian 5 fen and a half. Then Zhengjin issued November English gold at 1.7125, and Fuchang, among others, sold off, so the price was suppressed by a little over three taels. At 3:00 PM, the price was 702 and a half taels. Later, Yuanmaoyong, Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, Cuichangyong, and Shunli, among others, all competed to buy. As for the US dollar, Mitsui took it away at 31 yuan 75, and Zhengjin issued November English gold at 1.70625. People's confidence suddenly rose, and the market atmosphere was brisk. In just twenty minutes, the price rose by five taels. At 3:23 PM, it reached 707 and a half taels. Afterwards, the market suddenly turned downwards. Makali issued October English gold at 1.25 and November US dollars at 31 yuan 875, which was bought by the mainland. On the trading floor, Fuchang and Yifeng, among others, all sold off, so the price gradually fell by five or six taels, with only two or three taels of fluctuation. At 3:50 PM, the price was 701 and a half taels. Finally, retail investors came in and those who traded out US dollars also bought, so the price rose again by more than two taels. At 4:20 PM, the price was 703 taels 8 qian, and the market closed at 4:30 PM at 703 taels 6 qian, a rebound of 28 taels 1 qian compared to the previous day. However, after the market closed, it rose again by a little over three taels, only at the 700 tael mark. This was due to the unstable situation, and ordinary retail investors were eager to sell, especially as goods were also being sold. The maximum price for the day was 707 taels 5 qian, and the minimum price in the morning was 686 taels 2 qian, with a difference of 21 taels 3 qian. The quoted price was estimated to be between 134 and 123 taels. The result was 137 or 138 taels. The clearing price was 695 taels in the morning and 704 taels in the afternoon. The actual spot price was estimated to be plus 12 and a half taels. Yingfengheng and others had some transactions on behalf of customers.</p>
<p>The Buying Interest was High, and There were Very Few Sellers: There was More Demand Than Supply in the Trading Floor Transactions. According to Statistics, Dadecheng, Cuichangyong, Shunli, Yongfeng, Xiexingyong, and Yuanxingyong had all traded in and out. Da Xingyong, acting as an agent for foreign merchant Qiao Zhifu, bought thousands of lots, which was said to be offsetting the empty positions of Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yuandayong, Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Fuyu, Yifeng, and Yifengyong, all of whom sold. Qianchangxiang, Futaiheng, Dakang, and Yuantai, among others, made many transactions. In the afternoon, Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, Yuanchun, Shunli, Tongtaichang, Yongfeng, Zhifengyong, and Yuanchengyong all entered the market. Fuchang, Da Xingyong, and Yuanmaoyong had mixed transactions. Dadecheng, Yifeng, and goods also ordered hedging first. It was also heard that the notes that each firm had previously made for Japanese merchants had now been quickly settled, and they would no longer trade on their behalf to resist Japan. The Guangbang issued four or five hundred notes, and the Dalianbang issued and received more than two thousand notes, breaking even.</p>

<p>National News Agency, London, 29th: The London silver market closed today at the same price as yesterday, with the near-term at 16 pence 375 and the far-term at 16 pence 5625.</p>

<p>Chinese Merchants will Use US Dollars as the Settlement Price</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of English silver did not change, but the price of American silver fell slightly, and the exchange rate declined. The Japanese and American continued to add two points, totaling 4.940. As for the HSBC quoted price, there was a slight change, with the English, Japanese, Indian, and Singaporean prices remaining unchanged. The French exchange rate increased by 9 yuan, the German exchange rate decreased by 1 yuan, the mixed foreign exchange rate increased by half a shield, and the Hong Kong exchange rate increased by 25, totaling 78 taels and 25. The American dollar quote increased by 75, to 29 yuan. The domestic market was generally tense, but the English exchange rate was still flat, although it shrank, it was not as high as the American and Japanese. From the early morning, the exchange rates rose, then slightly weakened, and the afternoon was brisk. As a result, compared to the day before, the English gold shrank by 25, and the US dollar actually shrank by 75, a clear indication of tightening. The Japanese gold rose by four points, and the gold market re-emerged at a high peak, breaking through the 700 tael mark. As for the Chinese merchants' transactions, they were still brave, with English gold at about 300,000 pounds. The gold industry generally reached a settlement, trading out notes. The English and Japanese banks were relentless in their willingness to sell. The US dollar was about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan, mostly bought out. The Chinese, English, and Japanese banks all took in. Currently, Chinese merchants plan to use the US dollar as the settlement price. If this is implemented, the transactions will definitely be prosperous (but if the gold bar price is calculated according to the current market price of English gold, the price will be raised). The Japanese gold was sold by the Dalian gang to Japanese merchants for more than 1 million yuan, which was a trade for gold. Unexpectedly, the market suddenly showed a good situation yesterday.</p>

<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, ocean interest was used for securities delivery, and the selling pressure was very strong, so the interest rates all trended downwards. Until the noon market, the situation tightened slightly because the banks were still buying, and the price increased by half a li. As for the silver market, there was a large amount of cash available yesterday, and the banks could lend as much as possible, so the market atmosphere immediately eased.

<p>Delivery Amount of More Than 56.3 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange closed the market the day before yesterday (28th) to handle the settlement of September futures delivery. Yesterday, it resumed delivery, and there were no transactions in the market. The total amount of various bonds delivered in September futures was 56,315,000 yuan. Excluding the 14.8 million yuan that had been transferred last Friday, there was still 41,515,000 yuan delivered yesterday, which was a huge amount, unprecedented. Therefore, the delivery booths were busier than before. The largest amount was the Unified Tax, accounting for 14,495,000 yuan. Although the Salt Tax was the first delivery, it also reached 12,355,000 yuan. The remaining, such as the 20 Customs Tax, was more than 7.8 million, and the 20 Volume, the 19 Customs, Charity, Disarmament, and Reorganization taxes were between 3 and 4 million each. The others were smaller in amount. The delivery process was smooth. The delivery and transfer amounts of September futures for each bond are listed in the table below. (Unit: Yuan)</p>

<p>Register with the Exchange First, Then Seek Collateral from Banks</p>
<p>Previously, bond prices plummeted, causing market turmoil. The exchange consulted with the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and major central banks to maintain stability.

The collateral methods are as follows: (1) Each broker, up to the 22nd of this month, for this month (September)'s buy transactions made on behalf of clients, if there are difficulties in delivery and receipt, the entrusted broker may be responsible for requesting registration with the exchange to pledge the purchased bonds for loans.

The names and addresses of the clients, types, and quantities should be listed (excluding arbitrage) and reported to the General Affairs Section for registration and verification. (3) The aforementioned pledged bonds are of nine types (treasury bonds must be accompanied by interest coupons for the current month), and the collateral discount is calculated based on the book price recorded on the 24th of this month. (4) The aforementioned bond collateral is provided at 70% of the market value, with a monthly interest rate of 1.2%, and a term of three months. It is reported that the registered face value of each broker is approximately 8 million yuan. The specified collateral discounts for bonds are listed below (per 100 yuan):</p>

<p>650 Bales of Spot Yarn Traded</p>
<p>The spot yarn business is still considered good. Three parts of the spot market are experiencing shortages, and with Japan's forceful occupation of the Northeast and the escalating anti-Japanese military actions, Japanese yarn cannot be sold, making domestic yarn particularly tight. However, with a major disaster looming and the country in turmoil, credit is tightening. Severe floods are occurring in all parts of the country. If the price increases too sharply, the high prices will significantly impact actual sales. Futures yarn trading is suspended due to end-of-month delivery processing. Spot yarn purchases by various groups totaled 650 bales. Prices increased by 5 qian to 5 liang. 100 bales were imported from inland, 450 bales from Guangdong, 25 bales from Wuhu, 50 bales from Jiangxi, 225 bales from Hankou, and 50 bales from miscellaneous sources.</p>
<p>Slight Increase in Foreign Cotton</p>
<p>Spot cotton trading remains sparse, but there is still foreign cotton business. 2,600 bales of Yao cotton have been ordered. 50 pieces of Xingheng cotton at 32.00 yuan were imported from Guangdong and immediately shipped to Wuxi.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Extremely Low Yarn Delivery Volume This Month <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>In July, September standard yarn trading saw its peak with strong sales in Tianjin, reaching a high of 167.3 taels. Later, due to the poor condition of American cotton, it weakened again. A major merchant reversed from a long to a short position, and the market price broke through the 60-tael mark. Furthermore, due to the Wanbaoshan Incident, there was a boycott of inferior goods, and the market conditions increased again to over 164 taels. However, major players continued to sell, suppressing the price increase. Shortly thereafter, on August 8, the US government released its cotton production estimate, resulting in a sharp drop of over 110 points, severely impacting the yarn market and causing a drop of 6 taels in one day. The lowest price seen was 148.9 taels. Subsequently, a manufacturer took a long position and held it tightly. However, the global situation was exceptionally weak. Later in the middle of this month, Japan forcibly occupied the Northeast, and the anti-Japanese movement intensified, causing market conditions to suddenly rise, reaching a high of 161.1 taels. The last trade fell by 2 taels to 158.1 taels. The final delivery price was 160 taels, and the total delivery volume was 8,400 bales. However, only 150 bales were actually delivered by ten yarn merchants; the rest were self-delivered. The shortfall in this month's delivery volume is rarely seen.</p>

<p>American, British, and Indian Cotton All Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices weakened due to selling in the Southern market and weakness in Wall Street, with a lack of buyers. Futures fell by 8 to 12 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 30 to 34 points, and spot prices fell by 31 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 10 points. Indian cotton merchants bought in the morning, but prices softened at the close due to poor news from Liverpool. Pingle fell by 1 rupee, Oomra fell by 3.5 rupees, and White Raw Creek fell by 2.75 rupees. The original telegraphic record is on the left (dated 28th).</p>

<p>Nantou Yesterday, fewer merchants came to sell, and sales in urban and rural stores were sluggish. Transactions were similar to before. Thick and thin broken japonica rice and short-grain rice were down another dime. Medium-grade rice was even more stagnant. The market situation is unlikely to improve. Old Luyang pointed rice was in short supply and sold slowly, and the market also followed suit. New japonica rice was scarce, but sales were still thin, and the market was firm. New Duyang pointed rice arrivals also turned weak, and morning sales were still normal. However, sellers felt that prices had fallen too sharply yesterday and did not want to lower them further, so the market remained flat. After 10 o'clock, a sudden strong wind made the sales floor quiet, and the situation reversed and prices became stronger.</p>
<p>Xinzha Yesterday, the source from the mourning road was not much, and the market transaction was hardened by the cloudy and humid weather. The price of thick and thin broken top grade goods increased by another dime. However, the quality of the new japonica rice from Central China was normal, and the amount arriving was very little. The merchants and the local city are impatient because of the lack of arrivals yesterday, the market price is rising by a few points, but only six or seven tubes were sold in the afternoon. The new Yangdu pointed rice and Jiao Bai pointed rice arrival was rushing and sales were stagnant, returning low by two or three dimes. The arrival of the round group pointed new pier pointed rice was sold quickly, so the trend was weak, and the glutinous rice and wine merchants did not move, forming a soft three-cornered spectrum</p>
<h3 id="e120">Futures Foreign Rice Falls by One Qian <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for foreign rice was stable for spot goods, and futures prices fell because of small reports from abroad. Foreign firms were actively lobbying, and each firm released telegrams for 7,000 to 8,000 tons. It is difficult to say whether this batch of telegrams can be traded, but because the foreign firms devalued the inquiry, the market followed and softened. The small futures released were 5.62 yuan for April and from 5.7 yuan to 5.65 yuan for February and March. The market for delivery of small futures of 400 tons for February and March was 5.7 yuan, which was one qian less than the previous day. Although spot trading was small, prices were also stable. 200 bags of small futures were offered at 11.87 yuan.</p>

<p>Far-Month Hedgers Tighten Their Positions</p>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday, many long positions in the current month sold off heavily, causing significant changes in the market. Opening prices were already lower than before, and then fell further to three cents. Far-month prices also softened. However, there were hedgers and customers buying in the far month, and prices quickly improved after the fall. Although some small factories in the current month took advantage of the decline to cover their positions, the large number of chips held by the large long positions ultimately prevented the current month from keeping pace with the far month. As a result, prices remained at 1.9925 taels, unable to break through the 2-tael mark, down 1.5 cents from the previous day's closing price. Next month was up a little 2 li, November and December were up a bit more, January was up 1.25 cents, and February was up half a cent. The current month's flour futures will be delivered today. Yesterday, 25,000 bags from old brands were delivered.</p>

<p>Russian Wheat Dumping at Low Prices</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened yesterday morning, prices for all months fell, down 3 to 5 cents. Due to the dumping of Russian wheat at low prices, the pricing has gradually decreased, and confidence has long been weak. Yesterday's opening, in addition to small reports on foreign wheat, current-month flour futures also fell by 3 cents again, further weakening the wheat market. Spot goods also saw no inquiries from factories. Fortunately, large short positions took advantage of the decline to cover their positions in the afternoon, and the market gradually began to recover. Far-month prices reversed and rose, with December up 2 cents, February up 1 cent, and November and January unchanged. The current month was still down 1 cent.</p>

<p>Yesterday's hardware trading was due to the receding floodwaters along the Yangtze River, so merchants from Hankou, Sichuan, Anqing, and Jiujiang all sent letters to arrange purchases. Merchants from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai also made some purchases. However, merchants from Qinhuangdao and the three northeastern provinces were still unable to purchase due to the ravages of the Japanese army. As for factory business, there was also a sense of activity yesterday. Although transactions were not large, the situation was much better than the desolate scene before the festival. 400 to 500 dan of 18-gauge black iron sheets were offered at 11 taels, which was 1.5 qian better than before. 600 to 700 dan of 26-gauge and 28-gauge English galvanized iron were also sold yesterday. The price of 26-gauge remained at 15.7 taels, while the price of 28-gauge rose by 1.5 qian to 17 taels. Due to a shortage of 7-li English iron sheets, merchants were scrambling to purchase them, and the price was 6.3 taels, which was 5 fen better than before. Although buyers were eager to purchase 2.5-li sheets, the market supply was short, causing prices to rise to 8.5 taels, and 200 to 300 dan were offered. There were also over 400 dan of new galvanized wire traded, but most of the offers were for sizes 16 to 20, with few transactions for other sizes. In addition, although there were transactions for tinplate, new iron wire, I-beams, angle iron, and ribbed steel bars, there were no significant price fluctuations.</p>

<p>Taikoo Sugar Prices Rising Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports indicated that Cuban spot sugar prices were unchanged, and New York sugar futures for December also saw no rise or fall, with prices for March to May of next year falling by 4 points each. Java spot futures also lacked fluctuations. Trading of Dutch coarse and white sugar in the Association market remained sparse, with the price remaining at 11.375 taels. The market was very attractive. No. 20 medium white sugar was at 10.09 taels, No. 9 Dutch red sugar was at 9.4 qian.</p>
<p>Dutch white sugar was at 11.85 taels, and bowl green sugar was at 8.3 qian. The market situation was generally stable. The price of Taikoo sugar rose even more sharply. The price of B mark rose from 12.1 to 1.15 taels, and the highest price in the market was 12.2 taels. The company also sold hundreds of bags of spot goods at the same price. The price of HM mark was 11.575 taels, and the trend was also strong. Many Dutch sugar cargoes were sold. Shuntonglong sold 450 tons of old coarse sugar for October and November at a price of 5.55 Dutch guilders. At the same time, Yuanji, Jiecheng, and Huaxin also sold 200 to 300 tons at full price. The market was very sharp. Huaxin offered 500 bags of newly arrived coarse white sugar at a price of 11.4 taels, but the market was not surprised.</p>

<p>Notice of Complete Economic Severance with Japan The Chamber hereby notifies that for the sake of anti-Japanese national salvation, it convened a temporary Member Representative Conference on the 28th of this month and resolved that, as the Japanese are poisoning Chinese soil, occupying territory with military force, and their vicious flames are intensifying, it is urgently necessary to completely and permanently sever economic ties with Japan. Anyone who privately engages in buying or selling with Japan will be severely punished by the people upon discovery. This notice is hereby issued and recorded, and it is hoped that everyone will comply with public opinion and strictly abide by it. Anyone who outwardly complies but inwardly disobeys will be no different from inviting their own destruction and being an enemy of the country, and will inevitably become the public enemy of the entire nation. Please take note.</p>
<p>All Industries Should Expedite the Formation of Japanese Goods Inspection Teams The Chamber hereby notifies that for the sake of anti-Japanese national salvation, it convened a temporary Member Representative Conference on the 28th of this month and resolved that, in order to implement merchants' voluntary economic severance with Japan, all industry associations should be notified to immediately establish Japanese goods inspection teams to conduct self-inspections. If any industry association fails to establish an inspection team within one week, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce may dispatch an inspection team from another industry to conduct the inspection on its behalf. This notice is hereby issued and recorded. Please investigate and comply, and establish an inspection team within one week of receiving this letter, and report the organizational details to the Chamber for review. If the deadline is exceeded and no organization has been established or reported, the Chamber will dispatch an inspection team from another industry to conduct the inspection on its behalf. Please do not delay.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Urgent Telegram Issued by the Anti-Japanese Association Yesterday <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Requesting Chiang to Unify Military Power To Commander-in-Chief Chiang of the Nanjing Army, Navy, and Air Force: Unfortunately, our country is beset by disasters and internal strife is rampant, while foreign aggression is rising again. The image of collapse is imminent. As the ancients said, "A thing must first insult itself before others insult it." Looking around our country, there has been no peace since the founding of the Republic of China. Disputes have been heard daily. To this day, the people's livelihood is withering and the national situation is critical. If we do not strive to become strong, Japan will surely take the opportunity to invade the Central Plains. The collapse of China is imminent. Thinking of this, we cannot help but shudder. This conference resolves to telegraph to you, requesting the unification of military power, concentration of armed forces, and preparation for resistance against Japan. We believe that you, dedicated to the Party and the country, will surely comfort the Shanghai citizens' hopes. We hereby telegraph this message, humbly requesting your consideration and implementation. We await your orders with urgency and anticipation. The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association's Citizens' Assembly.</p>
<p>Sever Diplomatic Relations and Declare War on Japan To the Central Executive Committee of Nanjing: In order to realize its dream of a Manchurian-Mongolian policy, Japan, taking advantage of our disaster-stricken situation, suddenly sent troops to the three northeastern provinces, unreasonably occupying our important territories, burning, looting, killing, and bombing, using every means. All compatriots with blood and energy are filled with anger and hatred. Considering the urgency of foreign aggression and the precarious state of the country, the citizens of this city convened a citizens' assembly on the day before yesterday and resolved to telegraph the Central Government, demanding that the Japanese troops withdraw from the occupied territories within a limited time, otherwise, diplomatic relations will be severed and war will be declared on Japan. This is to demonstrate the spirit of our independent nation. It is not something that an independent country should do to merely hope that foreigners will uphold justice and only adopt a policy of calmness and endurance. We humbly request that you observe the national situation, comply with public opinion, rectify the army, and fight to the death on the battlefield to annihilate the Japanese invaders and restore our homeland. The spirit of the late Premier is what we rely on. We hereby telegraph this message, humbly requesting your consideration and implementation. We await your orders with sorrow and indignation. The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association's Citizens' Assembly.</p>
<p>Telegraph Requesting the Guangdong Faction to Abandon Previous Grievances To Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Gu Xiangqin, Wang Jingwei, Chen Bonan, Tang Shaochuan of Guangzhou: Japan is taking advantage of our country's preoccupation with disaster relief to disrupt East Asian peace and send troops to invade, occupying Liaoning and Jilin provinces and threatening Tianjin and Beijing. The pain of national subjugation is imminent. The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, with the determination to resist Japan and save the country, convened an anti-Japanese national salvation citizens' assembly the day before yesterday and resolved that you, as great figures of the Party and the country, who created the Republic of China, have differences only due to political disagreements. At this time of national crisis, it is hoped that you will abandon previous grievances and resist Japan together with the Central Government to jointly defend against foreign aggression. We will also send five representatives to Guangdong immediately to urge you to take on arduous tasks, work together, and save the crisis. We await your orders with urgency and anticipation. The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association's Citizens' Assembly.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Declaration Issued by the Liaoning Fellow Association Yesterday <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Executive Committee Meeting Convened This Morning</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association of Northeastern Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai will convene the second Executive Committee meeting at 9:00 AM today at the Chinese YMCA on Sichuan Road to discuss all anti-Japanese work. Yesterday, it issued a declaration stating that "Now, on the land of Manchuria, the bloody blood of the slaughtered is being spread, and the earth-shattering artillery fire is continuing. The fierce and strong Japanese imperialists are using their sharp guns and cannons to massacre tens of millions of northeastern compatriots, carrying out their bestial plundering ambitions." "Compatriots of the whole country, small and weak nations of the world, as long as we are not cold-blooded, can we still restrain our surging anger and passion?" "Only the northeastern people are drowning in the deep waters of plundering and slaughter, but the military and political authorities continue to play their deceptive tricks of serenity, forbearance, and non-resistance, while the great powers have clearly shown their ugly face of helping the strong and oppressing the weak in their so-called 'League of Nations'." "At this time, can we still wait quietly for others? We, the people who have suffered directly, can only unite and rely on our own strength to make a desperate resistance as vanguards." "Therefore, in this national fever for unity against Japan, we, the fellow townsmen of all circles in Shanghai who have stayed in Shanghai, with the enthusiasm and determination of vanguard assaults, and after rapid preparation, produced the organization of the Anti-Japanese Association of Northeastern Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai on September 26." "At the meeting, each fellow townsman was eager to express their hatred for the atrocities and their grief for the suffering compatriots, and in an atmosphere of grief and indignation, many anti-Japanese plans were carefully decided." "We have long known that the Japanese slaves, harboring their ambitions of aggression, have provoked more than seventy times in the Northeast in recent years, and finally sent troops to the Northeast to begin their bloody massacre." "Corpses are piled up like mountains in Shenyang, tens of thousands of unemployed workers are waiting to die, and hundreds of thousands of refugees are fleeing outside the border every day." "This kind of atrocity, the Japanese imperialists still say is not a military occupation." "Compatriots, compatriots of the whole country, the blood of the past 'May 3rd' 'May 30th' and the recent 'Korean Incident' is still not cold, and now this even more tragic massacre has continued to arrive." "However, we also know that this time the Japanese slaves' atrocities are not a simple fact, but have a serious economic, political and military background." "In order to achieve the ambition of swallowing Manchuria and Mongolia, in order to expel the economic power of the United States in Manchuria, in order to attack the Soviet Union in North Manchuria, which is in absolute conflict with it, in order to stabilize its domestic economic panic, and in order to alleviate the anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea, it is forced to start this blatant plundering and cruel massacre." "However, we know even more that under these complicated and intricate conflicts and contradictions, although imperialism uses all kinds of tactics of plundering and slaughter, its impending collapse is still inevitable and unavoidable." "Violent Japan, as well as other imperialists, must completely collapse under the unity of the oppressed masses."</p>
<p>First Day</p>
<h3 id="e129">Shanghai County Anti-Japanese Movement Propaganda Week <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Mass Meeting Held in Tangwan</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Headquarters, in light of the recent violent occupation of the Northeast Provinces by Japan, and in order to intensify anti-Japanese efforts, has expanded the Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese Association into the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. After the second joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees, it was decided that from September 28th to October 5th would be Anti-Japanese Movement Propaganda Week, during which mass meetings would be held in various districts in turn. The day before yesterday was the first day of Propaganda Week, held at the Tangwan Town public sports ground in the second district. Despite the torrential rain, the participation of the masses was extremely enthusiastic. The details of the meeting are summarized below:</p>
<p>Attendance: Peng Liren, Standing Committee Member of the County Party Headquarters; Jin Zuobin, of the Mass Education Center; all party members from the second district; people from all walks of life; students from various schools; Boy Scouts; and representatives from various groups, totaling approximately several thousand people.</p>
<p>Departure for Propaganda: The meeting passed several important motions, and after passing an important telegram, the attendees set out for propaganda despite the rain, dispersing around 6 PM.</p>
<p>Important Telegram: The telegram to Commander-in-Chief Chiang read: "The violent Japanese have invaded our territory, massacred our people, and lost thousands of miles of land. More than ten days have passed, and we have not seen the central government issue an order for mobilization, sever diplomatic relations, or declare war. We only hear of appeals for aid to the League of Nations and empty protests. We do not know that international justice has long perished. With enemy troops penetrating deep into the interior, you still want to negotiate through protests. Is this not an unprecedented absurdity? We earnestly request Commander-in-Chief Chiang to personally lead a large army to the Northeast to fight against Japan. The entire district's people pledge to be your support. All rear party and government problems, eliminate the boundaries between Beijing and Guangdong, and let advanced figures within the party cooperate to govern. Armed comrades, except for a reasonable number left to suppress bandits, should all go to the front to fight, boost morale, and jointly save the nation from peril. This is the only chance. If you continue to be keen on internal strife and procrastinate, I fear that the Song people's debates will be unsettled, and the Jin troops will have already crossed the river. The chief culprit of national subjugation will be our authorities who cannot evade blame. We present our urgent words with utmost anxiety and await orders." (Omitted below.) The telegram to the Central Party Headquarters read: "Japan has sent troops without cause, invading our Northeast provinces. The officials guarding the territory have retreated at every turn. In a matter of days, thousands of miles of land have been lost. Countless lives and property have been lost. This is the greatest shame and humiliation. Hope for mediation by the League of Nations has been dashed. Asking for help from others is not as good as striving for ourselves. Moreover, Red Russia is gathering troops on the border, eager to try. Once contact is made, our country's territory will immediately become a world battlefield, the people will be devastated, and tombs will become ruins. Thinking of the future, we cannot help but tremble. We earnestly request the central government to swiftly dispatch a large army to the Northeast to drive the Japanese troops out of our territory, protect our country's territory, and save our country's people. World peace can also rely on this for maintenance. Please do not procrastinate and lose the opportunity." (Omitted below.)</p>

<p>The Two-Road Party Headquarters immediately organized an anti-Japanese national salvation propaganda train team, departing at 5 AM today to conduct propaganda along the train, carrying various propaganda materials to raise the public's deep awareness and unite against Japan. The two roads are important transportation arteries, with no fewer than tens of thousands of passengers every day. This propaganda will surely have a great effect. The first and second teams both departed from Shanghai North Station at 5 AM yesterday morning. The first team conducted propaganda along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and the second team conducted propaganda along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, striving to resist Japan and fighting to the end, vowing not to stop until the goal of recovering lost territory and compensating China's losses is achieved.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Telegrams from Women's Organizations <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Two International Women's Organizations Replied Yesterday</p>
<p>Unanimously Expressed Dissatisfaction with Japan's Atrocities</p>
<p>The National Association of Chinese Young Women's Christian Association in this city invited the Women's Temperance Union, the Chinese Women's Suffrage Association, and other organizations the other day to discuss measures. It was decided that Japan's atrocities would be notified to women's organizations around the world immediately in order to achieve widespread publicity and international sympathy. On the one hand, a telegram was also sent to the Japan Women's Temperance Union, asking them to urge the government to stop the atrocities. The telegram has been sent, and yesterday, telegrams were received from the International Women's League for Peace and Freedom and the International Women's Suffrage Alliance, expressing unanimous dissatisfaction with Japan's atrocities and willingness to do their utmost to support our country. The telegrams are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Telegram to International Organizations: Urgent, to the World Association of Young Women's Christian Associations, the International Council of Women, the International Women's League for Peace and Freedom, the International Women's Temperance Union, and the International Women's Suffrage Alliance: At a time when the world is experiencing economic panic, and countries are too preoccupied to care for others, and when China is suffering from floods and is unable to resist, Japan, taking advantage of the Nakamura Incident, is carrying out military aggression, destroying railways privately, and brazenly dispatching troops to occupy Shenyang, Changchun, Yingkou, Andong, Liaoyang, and other places; burning our barracks, arsenals, government offices, and civilian houses; detaining our important officials; disarming our military police; capturing our large guard detachments; and massacring our innocent civilians, discarding humanity, violating the spirit of the Washington Conference, and violating the provisions of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, directly destroying peace in East Asia and indirectly endangering world peace. In the past three days, the situation has worsened, with troops being deployed and generals sent, steadily advancing. Jilin has also been seized, and Beijing and Tianjin are also reported to be strained. Japanese warships along the coast are landing to demonstrate. It is unknown when this kind of ambition and brutality will end. Today, Japan's barbarity and cruelty are a hundred times greater than the Jinan Massacre of that year, and the public's indignation is also incomparable to the past. However, the Japanese side is accustomed to one-sided propaganda and will easily confuse international audiences. Therefore, we present the course of events to clarify the responsibility of the aggressor. We hope that you will weigh the facts, make a fair judgment based on reason, uphold justice, safeguard fairness, arouse the sympathy of Europeans and Americans, create a strong public opinion, and adopt an attitude of supporting the weak and suppressing the strong to stop the Japanese military's brutal actions. If so, China will be fortunate, and the world will be fortunate. We hope you will consider this and await your guidance.</p>
<p>Telegram to Japan: Furthermore, a telegram was sent to the Japan Women's Temperance Union, saying: Your country has dispatched troops to Manchuria and Mongolia without any reason, without any prior warning of a declaration of war, which is a clear violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and a disruption of world peace. We ask your union comrades to unanimously urge your government to withdraw its troops to their original places immediately and to avoid the occurrence of such atrocities forever, which is what we hope for.</p>
<p>International Replies: The International Women's League for Peace and Freedom replied in a telegram yesterday, saying: We have just received your telegram and express our sympathy. We will immediately show the original telegram to the Japanese representative stationed in Geneva, urging them to send a telegram to their home government to stop the atrocities immediately. At the same time, all members of our committee will do their best to advocate public opinion in Geneva and express our deepest sympathy to your country. Furthermore, the National Women's Suffrage Alliance replied in a telegram yesterday, saying: We have read your telegram and are deeply shocked. The 400,000 suffragist women around the world pay close attention to world peace. Since your association has reported the truth of this matter to our association, our association will definitely report the truth to the League of Nations and do our best to find a solution.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the Ratepayers' Association <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Please Protest Japanese Troops Demonstrating in Hongkou</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession yesterday, saying: "Dear Sirs, in the recent violent occupation of our Liaoning and Jilin provinces by Japan, as if entering uninhabited territory, police reports have been frequent, and all those with blood and breath are filled with righteous indignation. Our association, on the afternoon of the 28th of this month, after deliberation by the Executive Committee, convened a general meeting of all member representatives. The members braved the rain to participate with great enthusiasm, and the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely tense. More than ten important motions were decided, including 'The Japanese marines have set up machine guns and armed military parades and demonstrations at the Hongkou shooting range and Jiaxing Bridge, etc., within the Shanghai Special District, and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association should question the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department for allowing them to act lawlessly.' After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the violent Japanese dared to set up machine guns and conduct armed parades in our city area, displaying a hostile act. The concession authorities turned a blind eye and allowed them to escalate. If an incident is triggered, who will be responsible? It was unanimously decided to ask your association to question the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department. We are sending you a record of the case and hope that you will take action."</p>

<p>Sixth District Party Headquarters Circular Telegram The Sixth District Party Headquarters issued a circular telegram, the gist of which is as follows: The unparalleled national crisis of complete destruction has already flared up before our very eyes. Therefore, the method of national suicide for our people should not merely involve hoping for strong intervention from the League of Nations or requesting the central government to generously dispatch troops and considering the matter concluded. It must go a step further, unify the national will, concentrate the national strength, and spur on the progress of the blue and white banners, to complete the righteous and courageous work of resisting Japan and saving the nation. We are not hesitating and looking back, shrinking from moving forward. It is simply that the bestial barbarians, unprecedented in history, neither know what public reason is nor what justice means. Therefore, to fulfill our Premier's Pan-Asianism, we have no choice but to eradicate the aggressive nature of the ambitious empire of East Asia. To wash away the national humiliation on the Pacific coast, we have no choice but to unite the strength of all the people and become the sole vanguard in beheading generals and planting flags. We are ready to throw away the heads of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor and pour out the blood of our beautiful rivers and mountains to settle the score with the Japanese once and for all. We are definitely not merely paying lip service to the issue of the loss of the Northeast and willingly acting as the government's belated cannon fodder. Therefore, our only cry is to realize the fundamental construction of "all people united as one, resisting the enemy together." We deeply regret that cooperation between Guangdong and Guangxi is still difficult, and the Red bandits are lurking with ulterior motives. The beautiful name of unified resistance may only remain as cold data in newspapers. However, everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world. Since we stand in the same area of ​​common blood and reproduction, we must not allow infighting and sit idly by while others slaughter us. Moreover, we bear the historical mission of saving the nation, and we should not engage in fratricide and bring suffering upon ourselves, causing the descendants of our divine Chinese race to lose the opportunity to resist the enemy together. Is this not deeply painful? Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that national self-determination will impose severe sanctions on any part that undermines peaceful unification. At the same time, we also hope that everyone will set aside their prejudices and jointly relieve the national crisis, so that the four hundred million descendants will still have a clean land to eat rice freely. That is a beautiful fruit that we will offer incense to day and night. Bismarck said, "To melt the national spirit and iron and blood together to prolong the life of the nation, this is the only 'divine duty' of the people." We dare to use this sentence as a warning bell for our nation ten thousand times over.</p>
<p>Tenth District Party Headquarters Resolutions The Tenth District Party Headquarters convened an emergency meeting for resisting Japan and saving the nation at 10:00 AM on the 28th, bringing together propaganda committees from various district branches. More than 20 representatives from the various branch propaganda committees and staff members of the district party headquarters were present. The meeting was chaired by Zhang Zhiqi, the propaganda committee member of the district. After the formal procedures, a report was given on the current rampant behavior of the violent Japanese and their ambitions. All the representatives present were extremely saddened and indignant. At that time, many important cases were passed.</p>
<p>The Postal Workers' Volunteer Army is Organized Tightly The postal workers' union is currently actively organizing a volunteer army, with Zhang Kechang, Miao Hongjun, and others responsible for handling the matter. Since the start of registration, more than 600 people have filled out volunteer forms to join. Once a venue is found, formal military training will be required.</p>
<p>City Merchants Enthusiastically Support the Boy Scouts' Resistance Against Japan The City Merchants' Boy Scout Troop (the 50th Troop of the Boy Scouts of China) announced the merchants' inherent duty to resist Japan and save the nation, and that Boy Scout training is the most practical training. Since then, merchants in the city have been flocking to the troop to request copies of the regulations. The troop stated that this autumn is the time for the third recruitment of new members. Due to the national crisis, to allow Shanghai merchants to participate in training as much as possible in order to serve the country, a plan to expand the organization and broadly recruit members has been drafted and submitted to the City Merchants' Association for adoption. The committee members of the Association believe that this training, when applied to young people, not only enables them to sacrifice for the country in times of national crisis, but also helps to save the general muddleheaded and degenerate youth in ordinary times, which is of great benefit to the country and society. Therefore, the proposal has been accepted and will be discussed in detail at tomorrow's executive committee meeting. It is expected that the formal recruitment will not be far off. It is also heard that the troop's "Instructions for Joining" have been completely exhausted. Once the recruitment is completed, another method will be announced and notified again.</p>

<p>All Employees of the Wuzhou Gu Ben Factory are Fully Armed Mr. Xiang Songmao, the general manager of Wuzhou Gu Ben Soap and Pharmaceutical Factory, yesterday organized all employees of the factory into a volunteer army battalion. Except for employees over 50 years old who are old and weak and cannot undergo training, all men and women have joined.

The position of battalion commander will be concurrently held by the general manager of the factory, and other company and platoon leaders will be concurrently held by important employees of the factory.</p>

<p>Declaration of the Electrical Experiment Research Association The Chinese Electrical Experiment Research Association issued a declaration yesterday regarding the Japanese atrocities, stating: (the beginning omitted) Now that the disaster of national subjugation is imminent and the national situation is in danger, all of our compatriots across the country must rise up in unison to urge the government to cease internal strife and resist foreign aggression, vowing to fight the Japanese pirates to the death. It is better to be shattered jade than to be a whole tile, to fight desperately with our backs to the city, or to annihilate those villains. Preparing for battle and killing enemies is the only way to protect our country. We, as members of this association, are merely subjects of the nation, and dare not fail to exert our utmost to be at the forefront, going through fire and water. We will not hesitate to dedicate our blood and break our necks. Writing this in indignation, blood and tears together, we hereby declare.</p>

Matters for discussion: (1) Regarding the issue of textile raw materials, it was resolved that domestic goods should be used first for the fine yarn of the weaving machine. If it is insufficient, the Great China Company on Wuma Road, Mr. Qian Xuanqing, or the Changshenghua firm on Sichuan Road, Mr. Chen Liqing, may be entrusted to contact British factories to handle fine yarn. (2) Regarding the issue of mechanical material items, it was resolved that He Dehuai and Xie Liangcai of the Mechanical Material Industry Association would be responsible for notifying that domestic goods should be used as a priority. If no domestic goods are available as substitutes, European and American goods may be substituted. In the future, if anyone still uses Japanese goods as substitutes, they will be handed over to the Anti-Japanese Association for punishment. (3) Regarding the issue of processing business, it was resolved that all dyeing and refining of goods by electrical silk weaving factories in the city must be sent to refining factories established by Chinese people, and no longer seek dyeing and refining from Japanese people. The refining industry in the city should also be warned that the raw materials used should not still rely on Japanese goods, and substitutes must be sought urgently to show thoroughness. (4) Regarding mechanical matters, only Zhuyatie Iron Factory attended the meeting, and Mr. Xu Xuechang represented the report. The peach wood used on the machines manufactured by the factory has long been replaced by German goods, and magnetic parts and other parts will be replaced by domestic goods immediately. The resolution to be discussed should be implemented. There are still many other issues, all of which are thorough measures to resist Japanese goods and revitalize domestic products. The meeting ended as the jade rabbit was about to rise.</p>

The third Anti-Japanese Committee also resolved that all Japanese goods owned by the industry should be sealed up from now on and not be bought or sold.

<h3 id="e136">Student Petition Group Returns to Shanghai <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Arriving This Morning</p>
<p>In the past two days, the student petition groups from various universities in Shanghai who went to Beijing totaled about 3,600 people. Yesterday, they went to the National Government again to petition. The points they raised have been accepted by the National Government, and Chairman Chiang gave a public speech. The representatives were satisfied and left Beijing last night to return to Shanghai. Three temporary trains were prepared at Xiaguan Station and departed at 8:00 PM, 10:00 PM, and 11:30 PM, respectively. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai around 8:00 AM this morning. However, more than 400 students from Daxia University took the night train to Beijing again last night. Although the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the director of the Education Bureau, and the railway authorities explained to them that the petition group that had gone to Beijing was already returning to Shanghai, and persuaded them to stop and avoid further travel, it was to no avail. The students still refused to get off the train, so the train left for Beijing.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Important News from the Anti-Japanese Aviation Industry <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Liaoning Refugees Continue to Arrive After the fall of Liaoning, residents and merchants could not bear the abuse and slaughter by Japanese soldiers and fled one after another. The first batch of southerners who arrived in Shanghai via the sea route landed in Shanghai on the 25th, totaling more than 110 people. The second batch escaped from Shenyang, first arrived in Dalian Bay, and then took a ship to Shanghai, arriving yesterday with a total of 176 people. Women accounted for five-tenths, children accounted for two-tenths, and the rest were men. Most of them were families. After the Japanese soldiers entered Shenyang, they abandoned all their belongings and fled with their families. Among the refugees in the second batch yesterday, 33 were from Jiangsu, 31 were from Zhejiang, 11 were from Ningbo, 41 were from Shanghai, and 42 were from Fengtian who fled to Shanghai. In addition, there were refugees from Jiangxi, Guangdong, Henan, and other provinces, most of whom were merchants. The refugees from Jiangsu and Zhejiang were mostly women. When the refugees landed at the Huangpu Pier, they were all in a very embarrassed state. When the refugees left Fengtian, they fled in a hurry. They could not carry the clothes and property they had in Fengtian and had to prepare some travel expenses to leave as soon as possible. The losses were incalculable. Some even lacked clothes and shoes, which shows the urgency of their escape. According to a Zhejiang man named Yang among the refugees, after the Japanese soldiers forcibly occupied various agencies in Shenyang, they posted notices prohibiting non-Japanese people from entering. They also set up ambushes everywhere in the streets and roads, posing with their weapons as if they were about to shoot. Chinese people who were unaware and mistakenly passed through their scattered troops were often shot and killed. The Japanese soldiers killed a Chinese person as if they were killing a chicken or a dog. In this recent group of refugees from the south, many family members were shot and killed by Japanese soldiers for no reason, and their bodies could not be found. We have worked hard for thousands of miles to make a living and do business, but suddenly our families were destroyed, and we suffered the tragedy of being arbitrarily killed by foreign soldiers. Decades of hard work were destroyed in an instant. The country has troops, and the people pay taxes, but they cannot provide the slightest protection in times of danger. Moreover, they issued an order not to resist, which is clearly a willingness to be slaughtered. As the people of the eastern provinces, it is better to be a slave of a conquered country. When Mr. Yang spoke, he was in tears, and it was unbearable to listen. Except for those who had relatives and friends, the rest were temporarily staying in small inns, waiting to return to their original hometowns in the coming days. It is said that a third batch of refugees will arrive tomorrow.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hong Kong Japanese Ships Suspend Operations As Japan Seizes the Eastern Provinces, which Affects the Survival of Our Nation, People Everywhere Have United to Resist. Chinese Merchants in Hong Kong Have Also Agreed to Sever Economic Relations with Japan, Stop Handling Japanese Goods, and Refuse to Take Japanese Ships. Now, They Have Taken a Step Further. All Dockworkers of Japanese Merchants Have Contacted Tugboat Gang Workers and Implemented a Strike. When Japanese Ships Arrive in Port, They Unanimously Refuse to Load and Unload Goods and Refuse to Carry Passengers. Their Solidarity is Even Stronger Than That of Shanghai Workers. The Japanese Can Do Nothing and Have Sent Telegrams to Shanghai, Ordering Shanghai Japanese Ships to Stop Carrying Goods and Passengers to Hong Kong. Yesterday, the Shanghai Nissin Company Received a Telegram and Ordered the Nanhua Liner Lushan Maru and Songshan Maru to Stop Going to Hong Kong and Sent Wireless Telegrams Notifying the Lushan Liner En Route to Proceed to Guangdong After Arriving in Shantou. From Today, Japanese Ships in Shanghai Will No Longer Carry Goods and Passengers to Hong Kong. The Business of the Hong Kong Liners of Jardine Matheson and Taikoo Docks is Booming.</p>
<p>Striking at Sino-Japanese Liners The effectiveness of this boycott is rarely seen in the past. Most of the transactions of various Japanese firms have completely stopped. Since the Anti-Japanese Association announced that if there are unscrupulous merchants privately transporting goods for the Japanese, they will be severely punished if found out, customs brokers and Japanese merchants have completely cut off contact. In the past, goods from the Sino-Japanese liners of the Japanese Postal Company were not boycotted. This time, such as the Rokko Maru, Aso Maru, Tsukuba Maru, and Kasagi Maru arriving in Shanghai, no goods were loaded, and exports were even less, only 10% of what they used to be. The Yangtze River liners of Nissin, in addition to slightly carrying Japanese sugar and kelp, have practically no other goods. Yesterday, the Osaka Changsha Maru left Shanghai for Tianjin, carrying only one ton of export goods. The business of the Dalian Steamship Company has also fallen by nine-tenths. The Shanghai Toyo Customs Broker has almost completely stopped and has nothing to do. Recently, various Japanese merchants in Shanghai are also anxious about this, fearing that if our country continues to persist, Japanese merchants will have no foothold in China.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Sail to Wenzhou In recent days, Japanese warships have been coming to the Yangtze River one after another. There is already the first team in North China and the second team. There are also two from Lushun and Magong sailing to our country's seaports. Recently, the warship Tsushima has been transferred from Sasebo and loaded with marines to Shanghai. Yesterday, it was heard that it has been decided to land part of the army in Haideng, and the rest ordered the Tsushima to carry them to Nanjing in the coming days to demonstrate, and ordered the Hirado to sail to Hankou, transferred the Uji to Shanghai, and transferred three destroyers, the Yanagi, Aoi, and Take, from Magong to Wenzhou in a hurry. The Navy Ministry of the country has also organized the 25th warship team, sending eight destroyers, three gunboats, and one cruiser, preparing to order them to enter various parts of central China.</p>
<p>Silk Merchants from Andong Flee to Shanghai After the violent Japanese forcibly occupied Shenyang, Andong was also occupied. Andong is a large trading port with a thriving commercial market. The wild cocoon silk produced in the Northeast is distributed through Andong as a market. There are many wild silk factories in Andong. After the violent Japanese forcibly occupied Andong this time, the source of wild cocoon silk tended to stop. The wealthy merchants all took their families on foreign ships to seek refuge. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Zhoushan ship sailed from Andong to Shanghai, carrying the aforementioned gentlemen and merchants seeking refuge, totaling about fifty or sixty people, most of whom were silk merchants. They all stayed in various wild silk warehouses. Yesterday, I met Mr. Jin, a wild silk merchant who fled to Shanghai from Andong. He said that after the Japanese army invaded the Chinese streets of Andong and occupied various agencies, the shops automatically closed the next day, and the silk factories also stopped work. The price of banknotes fell tragically. The Japanese inconvertible gold notes (i.e., old man notes) were popular in Northeast China on weekdays, and each yuan could be exchanged for two yuan and six or seven corners. At this time, it fell sharply to two yuan. On the day we set off, each yuan could only be exchanged for one yuan and five corners. The financial panic reached its extreme. The wild cocoon silk inventory is limited, but various places are preparing to raise silkworms (i.e., wild silkworms) and release seeds. Many people are fleeing. This blow will definitely cause a reduction in the harvest of silkworms in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Telegram from Cantonese Party Members in Shanghai to Guangdong Calling for Peace <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Please have Hu Assume Great Responsibilities</p>
<p>Yesterday, Cantonese party members in Shanghai sent a telegram to Guangdong calling for peace, and telegraphed Hu Hanmin to assume great responsibilities and unite against foreign enemies. The two telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>To Hu Hanmin: Telegram forwarded by the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters to Mr. Hu Zhantang. The national crisis is imminent. The hopes of all living beings rest on you, sir. We implore you to rise up and exert yourself to save the tens of millions of acres of land about to be lost and the hundreds of millions of people awaiting ruin. Uphold the expectations of the late Premier and comfort the hopes of the common people. We respectfully submit this telegram from Shanghai, earnestly seeking your consideration. Submitted with reverence by Deng Tongwei, Zhao Shaoyi, Luo Changmin, Rong Junlin, Liang Guozhang, Huo Zhennan, Yang Guoqi, Yi Weizhai, Liu Weishan, Liu Xiaoliu, Zheng Shaoqing, and others from the Guangdong expatriate party in Shanghai Special Municipality.</p>
<p>To Guangzhou: Most urgent. Telegram to Mr. Gu Xiangqin, Mr. Wang Jingwei, Mr. Sun Zhe, Mr. Tang Shaochuan, Mr. Deng Ziru, Mr. Xiao Focheng, Mr. Xu Ruwei, Mr. Chen Bonan, Mr. Li Deguo, Mr. Bai Jiansheng, and Mr. Zhang Xianghua of Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Japanese imperialists are taking advantage of our extraordinary flood disaster and the rampant internal red bandits to send troops to the East and invade our Manchuria and Mongolia, slaughtering our people and burning our homes. Their violation of international law, disregard for the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and violent and reckless actions are extreme. All our countrymen with any sense of honor are filled with grief and indignation, sharing the same hatred for the enemy. You, gentlemen, have worked hard in the revolution, and your achievements are remarkable. You must be enraged by the brutality of the Japanese invaders. However, since the establishment of the Guangdong government, the power within the Party seems to be dissipating, and foreign aggression is intensifying. As the saying goes, "Brothers quarrel at home, but unite to resist external aggression." Now, the foreign enemy's threat is cutting deep into our flesh, so the responsibility is heavy and the road is long. All our comrades have an inescapable duty. If you gentlemen would deign to come, perhaps we could silence the slanderers and work together to quell the great crisis and avenge the national humiliation. There is no other option. Moreover, since the revolution, Guangdong has suffered many disasters. Now that the national crisis is worsening daily, and destruction is imminent, saving the country and loving the Party is exactly what is needed at this time. Fellow comrades, you will surely not dismiss these words as irrelevant. We await your clear instructions and hope you will come quickly. The South awaits. With best wishes. Submitted with reverence by Deng Tongwei, Zhao Shaoyi, Luo Changmin, Rong Junlin, Liang Guozhang, Huo Zhennan, Yang Guoqi, Yi Weizhai, Liu Weishan, Liu Xiaoliu, Zheng Shaoqing, and others from the Guangdong expatriate party in Shanghai Special Municipality.</p>

<h3 id="e143">News from Various Provinces Regarding Disaster Relief Yesterday <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>News from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association</p>
<p>The Tragedy of Xinghua's Flood Disaster: The flood disaster in Xinghua is extremely serious. Recently, the Xinghua Chamber of Commerce's temporary flood relief group sent a report on the flood disaster in Xinghua County. Every word is filled with grief and brings tears to the eyes. The original text is as follows: "Heaven has punished our Xinghua, turning it into a watery realm. The disaster affects the entire county, something never heard of before. Since the breach of the You-Shao Canal embankment, our people, hundreds of thousands of them, thought they would all perish together. Now, they are still eking out an existence, but we do not know how they will survive. Our association, its spirit just settling,勉盡未死之責、不爲死者呼寃但爲生者乞命敢將最近調查所得災狀及臨時救濟辦法報告如下、(I) Losses of life: Telegraph communications have been cut off since the day the Yun embankment breached. Two-丈 high torrents rushed down, and hurricane-force rain fell non-stop all night. People, as if in a dream, suspected that the water was falling from the sky and fled in panic, not knowing where to go. Hiding in small boats was considered the best option, but who knew that the waves would surge and capsize in an instant? Seeking life turned into seeking death. Those who did not have time to flee clung to the water, shouting for help, climbing trees and roofs, hoping to survive. But the trees broke, and the roofs collapsed, and they were still swallowed up by the boundless waters. Corpses floated everywhere, but there was no one to rescue them and no place to bury them. Now that the water has subsided slightly, people still hear about those who are lost due to the wind and danger every day. It is estimated that the total number of deaths in the county is more than the number of wretched ghosts under the breached dikes of You and Shao. If the water level can return to normal in the future, an accurate number can be obtained by checking the household registers. (II) Losses of food: Xingyi has suffered two great harvests and one major disaster in the last three years. Food was already extremely scarce, but this year's opening of the dams led to even more destruction. The usual practice of opening the Cheluo dam seven days before autumn was followed by the consecutive opening of the Xin and Nan dams, causing the green crops in the fields to be almost completely submerged. Fortunately, the eastern part of the county still has Yongfeng, Heta, Lao Zhong, Xia Wang, and Da Jiong, which were not breached, and a small harvest can be obtained, which is of some help. But the 800-丈 breach in the Yun embankment caused the water to rise rapidly and rush down. The various forts were unable to resist and collapsed one after another. In a few days, the small amount of rice harvested earlier was lost again. A current survey shows that only those who have more grain-producing land in the area can temporarily survive. Those who have less land or no land account for two-thirds of the county's population and are waiting to be fed, unable to wait any longer. (III) Losses of housing: After the opening of the three dams in Xingyi, the entire city fell into the abyss of the Nine Springs. The water depth in high houses is three to four feet, and low houses are submerged to the eaves, or even completely submerged. Residents in the water are constantly in danger of capsizing. But two hurricanes and rainstorms came one after another. The wind increased the power of the water, and the water rode the wind, with the waves reaching the tops of the trees and the city walls were pierced in fourteen places. Temples near the water around the city, such as Banruo Temple, Guanyin Pavilion, Jile Temple, Dizang Temple, and Longzhu Temple, famous monasteries, were either completely destroyed or partially collapsed. Other public and private houses had collapsed walls and cannot be counted. The most tragic thing is Zhongbao Village, a major town north of the city, which is surrounded by a large lake. More than 1,000 households in the town have only eleven houses left standing. Even the tall houses in the town could not avoid being washed away. Who can guarantee the existence of the other thatched houses in the countryside? Visiting the countryside, all one sees are ruined buildings and collapsed walls. Everything in the houses has been washed away. The disaster victims are huddled in small boats or perched on broken roofs. They encounter wind and rain, and wild cries are heard everywhere. The future is bleak, and they do not know when they will be able to settle down. (IV) Other losses: The Huai River has been flowing east for more than a month, and it is not known when it will recede. Recalling the breach of the Qingshui Pool in the fifth year of Tongzhi and the overflowing embankment of the Grand Canal in the tenth year of the Republic, the flood was not as great as this, and the storage period was not as long. Regarding agricultural matters, such as windmills being almost completely destroyed, and cattle being sold cheaply, people have no livelihood for a long time and no place to live. The misery is beyond description. In addition, schools have been forced to close, and students have also become refugees and lost their places. Crafts have been abandoned, and workers have no way to beg. And in our business community, goods have been damaged and capital has been lost. Those who cannot resume business are also numerous. The four classes of people have suffered the same disaster, equal to annihilation. This was not something that could have been anticipated when the dams were opened. Now, because the damage is so great and the pain is so deep, all government affairs have been abandoned. It is extremely difficult to maintain the precarious situation. After the meeting, feeling sad, we were deeply concerned that order would not be maintained. After opening the dams, we first籌　平市米局 to stabilize people's hearts. Later, we also joined with the local government to organize relief groups to 　　 rescue from all sides. Thanks to the provincial government officials, we received a large amount of funds for emergency relief, and we also承江南北慈善大家、分别合組救災會、救災團、先後　興施放振糧振品、仍予收容難民, we have already rescued more than 5,000 people. Deep benevolence and great kindness, we celebrate our rebirth. However, the disaster is widespread and there are many people in need of rescue, and the dangerous period has not yet been overcome. We still懇各當道各慈善界, we are guided by the principle of rescuing people and rescuing thoroughly, and we are making large-scale plans and long-term assistance. Members come to Xing and督同地方, we will carry out universal relief. The disaster victims will be spared death, and we will be grateful. Fonian, there are many disasters everywhere and great difficulties in the days to come. Recently, members of the association have gathered and decided to form a temporary flood relief group. In addition to the overall local relief, we will specifically筹办平糶麵粉两月, continue to办减价粥局三月,兼施篷蓆,并给寒衣, the funds needed are estimated to be 100,000 yuan. All industries will raise as much as possible within their capabilities, and we will also叩各大商埠善之士, give assistance to make up for local deficiencies and謀秩序之苟安, we only seek to度到來春, and then make续救办法, however, this 屬治標之策, it only济燃眉, as for its fundamental remedy, we should恳水利當道, quickly将运堤决口之二十七处, and the date of completion is 尅期完堵, in order to block its source, and the disaster will be restored, so there is hope, otherwise, the upstream Honghu Lake will move to Xingyi, and the disaster of vicissitudes of life will not be in the present, but in the coming year, what people's livelihood can be said to be, the Xinghua County Chamber of Commerce temporary flood relief group is respectful."</p>
<p>The Enthusiasm for Contributing to Disaster Relief: Since its establishment, the association has raised funds from all over the world. People from all walks of life are in great pain. Both north and south of the Yangtze River are deeply affected by the flood, and the breaches of Gao and Shao dikes have turned the five villages under Yangzhou into swamps. They are all reducing their clothing and food and donating money to help with disaster relief. The education sector is also collecting funds and donating. Teachers and staff of Nanjing Middle School Experimental Elementary School, in addition to contributing their own money, are also saving public banquet expenses to help disaster relief. Elementary school students are also saving money from snacks to help disaster relief. Even school workers in the school who earn only a few yuan a month are donating generously, such as Huang Gui, Liu Gui, Wang Pei, Wan He, Xia Lin, Ren Er, Wang Cheng, Yuan Cheng, Liu Cheng, and Chen Ma, all of whom have made donations. This shows that people are eager to help the public and that everyone has the same heart.</p>
<p>Report on Disaster Relief in Anhui</p>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Association for Provincial Floods received a telegram yesterday from Xu Guozhi, a relief worker in Anhui, from Anqing, saying, "Report by express mail. Recently, I received reports from relief workers Cao Qingquan and Junhan in He County that they arrived in He County on the 11th. Since it was late, I plan to go to the county government tomorrow to convene various legal groups to discuss and reach a public decision, and then inspect the disaster situation in various districts to start the investigation and relief. Detailed reports will be provided later. I also received a telegram from relief worker Wang Yijing and others in Tongcheng, stating that they have arrived in Tongcheng and are now meeting with the county magistrate to invite various groups to discuss how to handle the matter. However, the disaster is serious in Tongcheng, and the emergency relief funds are meager, making it difficult to divide and distribute. How to investigate and relieve will be reported later. According to Yang Jianquan, the relief worker in Huaining, he has been working with the Guangjiwei Flood Relief Association for days to investigate in Zhudun and Wuliwei, selecting the extremely poor who are unable to live, and filling out tickets for each level, etc. Also, the Provincial Relief Affairs Association sent a letter stating that the central government had previously issued 15,000 yuan in emergency relief funds to Huaining. Because the disaster in Guangjiwei was serious, it was decided to allocate 9,000 yuan from the funds, together with the 15,000 yuan in emergency relief funds issued by the central government to Tongcheng, and then allocate a certain amount to be used specifically for Guangjiwei, causing other disaster-stricken areas in Huaining to receive only 6,000 yuan in relief funds. The disaster is great and the funds are meager, making it difficult to allocate the amount evenly, etc. The letter requested the association to allocate some more funds from the relief fund to make up for the shortfall. After investigating, the statement is true. It has been approved to allocate an additional 1,000 yuan in addition to the 3,000 yuan previously allocated to the county, making a total of 4,000 yuan in relief funds and 500 bags of rice scattered in Huaining. The relief funds and 　 scattered in various counties in Anhui, except for Hefei, which is指定數目 by the Junhui 　. Huaining　Cheng Wuwang Jiang Susong He County Chaoxian Hanshan and other counties were allocated according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs核定災縣　級人口,已否受振,詳愼支配. After电陈钧会, a联席会议 will be held with the Provincial Relief Affairs Association, and a list will be opened and reported, and then分別函知 will be sent to the various counties to转党政机关各法团会同协助本会放振员,切實查放.

<p>Zhang Zilian of the Samsung Cotton Weaving Factory sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation, stating that Japan is forcibly occupying our Northeast, and the people of the whole country are vowing to implement a thorough boycott of Japanese goods with all effective means. Unexpectedly, a few unscrupulous merchants are taking advantage of the opportunity to raise the prices of domestic yarn and other raw materials. Their conscienceless and insane actions are not enough to quell public anger even if they were to be skinned alive. Please, in accordance with the purpose of resisting Japan and saving the country, take swift action. For example, 16-count yarn should not exceed 160 taels, and 20-count yarn should not exceed 170 taels. Otherwise, let the prices rise, and not only will small-scale industrial and commercial enterprises not be able to unite in the cause of resisting Japan and saving the country due to the high cost of raw materials.</p>

<p>New Appointee Takes Office Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Labor Union Still Retains Mr. Guo</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Chengen, director of the Shanghai Arsenal, has found his duties overwhelming since simultaneously serving as director of the Two Roads Bureau. He has submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Military Administration, which has been approved. Mr. Song Shiyi has been appointed as the new director of the arsenal. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resignation Process: Since Guo Chengen, director of the Shanghai 　　　　　　　　　, also serves as director of the Two Roads Bureau, the duties of the Roads Bureau are busy, 　　 and there are duties as director of the Arsenal, so the chief of the general affairs department of the factory, Xu Mujun, was appointed to act as the agent. The factory machinery was once accidentally失愼, 赵数日, the gun factory also reported a fire. Although Guo tried his best to investigate, he has not yet found out the truth. In addition, Guo holds two positions, which inevitably leads to顾此失彼, so he submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Military Administration the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Succession Already Determined: After the Ministry of Military Administration received Guo's resignation, they understood that Guo had difficulties. The affairs of the arsenal are extremely important and should be handled by a specialist who is responsible at the factory every day. Therefore, Chen Gongxia, the political vice minister and director of the Ordnance Department of the ministry, immediately approved the resignation and appointed Song Shiyi, the deputy director of the department, to succeed him. After Song received the appointment, he has decided to come to Shanghai tomorrow to take office.</p>
<p>Supervision of Handover: In addition to ordering Song to take over, the Ministry of Military Administration also instructed Du Zhiying, director of the Accounting Department of the Military Needs Department of the Ministry, and others to come to Shanghai to supervise the handover. The original order stated, "In order to comply with the order, Guo Chengen, director of the Shanghai Arsenal of the Ministry, has been approved to resign, and Song Shiyi has been appointed to fill the vacancy, and orders have been issued separately. Now, Du Zhiying, director of the Accounting Section of the Military Needs Department, and Zhuang Quan, a special commissioner of the Ordnance Department, are dispatched to the factory to supervise the handover. In addition to the separate announcement, this order is hereby issued for compliance."</p>
<p>Guo Jinjing: After the Ministry of Military Administration approved Guo's resignation, Guo immediately sent a telegram to the new director, Song Shiyi, at around 3:00 PM yesterday, asking him to come to Shanghai to take office as soon as possible. Because he was奉蔣主席之召, he took the night express train to Jinjing last night.</p>
<p>Resignation of Staff: After Guo's resignation was approved, Xu Mujun, chief of the general affairs department of the factory, Zhang Deqing, chief of the engineering department, Li Jingxia, chief of the accounting section, Ding Houfu, chief of the auditing section, Xie Jizu, chief of the purchasing section, and Zhou Daifu, chief of the general affairs section, have all resigned one after another.</p>
<p>Song's Brief Biography: The new director, Song Shiyi, is 46 years old and from Hunan. He graduated from the Japanese Army Officer Academy and served as an army regimental commander and brigade commander. He is currently the deputy director of the Ordnance Department of the Ministry of Military Administration and is well-versed in military administration and academics.</p>
<p>Trade Union Retains: Guo Chengen, director of the Shanghai Arsenal, resigned from the position of director of the Shanghai Arsenal to the Military Industry Department of the Ministry of Military Administration because of his heavy duties. He has been granted approval by the authorities. However, the Trade Union learned of the situation and was deeply saddened. Since Guo came to the factory, he has spared no effort in rectifying and planning and has been thinking of ways to increase wages to alleviate the hardships of the workers. Therefore, the workers unanimously support him and work hard to produce products. Therefore, the association earnestly retains Guo in accordance with the wishes of the workers and telegraphed the director of the Ordnance Department yesterday to retain Guo's tenure. "The telegram is omitted."</p>

<p>Party and Government Agencies to Review</p>
<p>The Shanghai Executive Committee believes that the Shanghai Labor Union was previously abolished by a clear order from the Central Government, and the labor-management contracts it signed with the capital will be reviewed by party and government agencies to determine whether to retain or abolish them in order to benefit the workers. The following is a letter from the Municipal Party Headquarters to the Social Affairs Bureau: "Dear Sirs, the Municipal Labor Union was previously abolished by a clear order from the Central Government. However, the Labor Union and others have signed many labor-management contracts with the capital. The contracts should not be cancelled along with the Labor Union's loss of corporate status, resulting in the sudden loss of protection for the majority of workers. In view of this, the Central Government has stipulated that the local party and government agencies should review the contracts in accordance with the current laws and regulations in order to separately retain or abolish them to benefit the workers and the real economy. This has been decided by the ninth regular meeting of our association, and Hou Dachun, Lu Jingshi, Huang Zaoxiong, Yang Qingyuan, and Zhou Sizhi have been designated to work with your bureau to send personnel to review the contracts. We hereby send this letter to you for your reference and reply."</p>

<h3 id="e151">City Social Affairs Bureau Burns Rice Borer Eggs and Moths <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>680,532 Rice Borer Eggs</p>
<p>167,402 Rice Borers</p>
<p>—Removing One Rice Borer Egg Mass Can Increase Grain Yield by Half a Catty—</p>
<p>Recently, rice borers have caused damage, resulting in poor autumn harvests and significant harm to people's food supply. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has repeatedly organized cooperative rice borer eradication experimental zones and offered subsidies to farmers who specifically contract to participate. This includes activities such as using lights to attract moths and removing egg masses to eliminate rice borers. At the same time, personnel were dispatched to various districts, carrying slogans, illustrations, and rice borer eradication tools, to explain methods of capture. Furthermore, municipal committee members from each district were ordered to supervise local farmers to work together in preventing and eliminating the pests to avoid crop damage. However, farmers in various districts mostly looked on, and capturing the pests was not actively pursued. If this continues without attention, the consequences are unimaginable. In order to motivate farmers to actively search for and capture rice borer eggs and moths, the bureau formulated purchasing methods and weekly report forms, which were submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. Initially, 2,000 yuan was allocated for pest eradication expenses. From July 1st to August 30th, a total of 680,532 egg masses and 167,402 rice borers were collected. The total expenditure for the purchases was 1,077 yuan, 3 jiao, 1 fen, and 3 li. The bureau transported all the collected materials to an open space in front of the Xiejiao Flower God Temple yesterday afternoon at 2 pm for burning. Representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government were sent to supervise. Municipal committee members from various districts and bureau staff were present to observe. It was found that the rice borer eggs and moths purchased had a significant impact on increasing the rice grain harvest in the city. Removing one rice borer egg mass can reduce over a hundred rice stalk; with each stalk yielding an estimated 150 grains, removing one rice borer egg mass can increase grain yield by half a catty. Based on the 680,532 egg masses collected, the city can increase its harvest by over 340,000 catties, equivalent to over 340,000 dan or over 1,700 shi of polished rice. The increased yield from purchasing rice borers is not included in this calculation. The cost is small, but the returns are substantial. A summary of the purchase of rice borer moths and eggs in various districts of the city is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Summary of Rice Borer Moth and Egg Purchases in Shanghai Districts</p>
<p>District | Rice Borer Eggs | Rice Borers | Purchase Amount (Yuan) | Actual Purchase Days | Purchase Days | Start Date | End Date | Remarks</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |</p>
<p>YinHang | 258,952 | 132,534 | 1005.08 | 3 | 2 | July 8 | August 30 | The institute increased the price once and reduced it twice</p>
<p>Caojing | 34,080 | 33,868 | 179.613 | 4 | 0 | July 1 | August 12 | The institute increased the price once</p>
<p>Agricultural Experiment Field | 387,500 | 592,62 | 3 | 3 | July 14 | August 31 | The institute reduced the price once</p>
<p>Total | 680,532 | 167,402 | 1777.313 |  |  |  |  |</p>
<p>Note: The bureau originally set the purchase price at one copper coin for every two rice borer moths or eggs. Due to the low number of purchases, on July 22, a notice was issued to all institutes to increase the purchase price to one copper coin for each rice borer egg mass. Subsequently, the price reverted to the original, and on August 25, it was further reduced to one copper coin for every four rice borer moths or eggs.</p>

<p>Ring Leader Wang Daming Arrested by Police</p>
<p>Large Number of Gang Members and Arms Subsequently Seized</p>
<p>Lu Liankui, Chief Inspector of the General Investigation Department of the Central Police Station, and Zhou Honglin, an investigator, learned that Wang Daming, a native of Jiangbei, was the leader of a kidnapping gang. They collaborated with Western detectives and apprehended Wang on Guangdong Road the other day. Under interrogation, they learned that an accomplice, Chen Sanwenzai, was hiding at No. 60 Dongoujia Road. Chief Inspector Lu led Chinese detectives Wang Changgen, Liu Shaokui, investigators Yin Zhanqing, and Feng Zhiming to arrest him. Upon arrival, the house was empty. The detectives were deployed to guard the area around the house. Later, a person was seen running away from No. 62. Suspecting his actions, they apprehended him. He confessed that he was Chen Sanwenzai, whom they were trying to arrest. They then went to No. 62 and arrested Chen's concubine, Chen Zhu. They were taken to the police station. At the same time, Chinese detectives Wang Chengying and Shen Tianbao also arrested two accomplices, Lu Qingcai and Jiang Chunjin, at Aiduya Road, and the intersection of Changan Road and Hengfeng Road in Zhabei. They seized one Mauser pistol, two handguns, and 49 bullets at No. 244 Kaixueni Road in the French Concession. It was found that the number of kidnapping cases committed by Wang and his gang was countless. They were all taken into custody immediately. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer Ru Bao Yi presented a report to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division, stating that the cases committed by the defendants were all very serious, so no announcement could be made today. If the court insisted on understanding, please prohibit the audience from listening to avoid leakage of information. Also, the police station has not yet investigated the defendant's crimes in detail, so no formal prosecution has been made. Please approve the request for temporary detention, and a public prosecution will be filed as soon as it is verified. Subsequently, Chinese and Western detectives submitted reports on the arrest. Xu Jiashi, the criminal court judge, approved the report and ordered the defendants to be temporarily detained.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Advising Against Using US Wheat as Seed <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received an order yesterday from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines advising against using US wheat borrowed by China as seed. The original order stated, "An agreement has been reached regarding the shipping of US wheat for disaster relief. However, the purchased US wheat should only be used as relief grain for human consumption and should not be used as seed. This is because the source of the US wheat is uncertain, and the vast land and water transportation make it inevitable that there will be stale and rotten seeds, which are not easy to germinate. In addition, the climate and soil of our country are too different from those of the United States. According to the principles of seed transfer and practical experience, it is impossible to adopt it rashly, which would mislead agricultural affairs. We are sincerely afraid that our country's farmers lack scientific knowledge and are in disaster and poverty, so they will not have time to choose carefully and will easily misuse the US wheat as seed. We should take precautions in advance and advise them in advance to avoid mistakes. As for seeds in disaster areas, the Ministry has already ordered local arrangements to be made in order to avoid delaying agricultural time."</p>

<p>Gao Chenghua, a local villager, hired lawyer Xu Yannian to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court, claiming that Gao Yueting, the plaintiff's uncle, only had one daughter, who was married to Chou Shenghua. Gao Yueting had no sons, so he adopted the plaintiff as his heir, as evidenced by a family meeting record. Unexpectedly, after Yueting and his wife passed away one after another, all the inheritance was occupied by Chou Shenghua. Attempts to reason with him were ignored, so the lawsuit was filed, requesting the court to order the defendant to hand over the property in full. The court summoned the parties yesterday based on the complaint. Plaintiff Gao Chenghua first stated the facts. Defendant Chou Shenghua stated that he was in fact taken in as a son-in-law to Gao Yueting's family. As both son-in-law and adopted son, Yueting and his wife did not establish the plaintiff as an heir when they were alive. There is a memorial tablet for Yueting's 20th anniversary stating that the plaintiff is a nephew, which proves this. He requested a clear investigation and hired a lawyer to handle everything on his behalf. The judge dismissed them and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<p>Xu Naikang, a native of Yancheng from No. 33 Xiaoxin Village, Dacaojia Ferry, Shanghai West, is 36 years old. Due to poverty, he has not yet married. Recently, due to years of savings, he had over 200 yuan and thus thought of seeking a wife. Therefore, he often told his fellow villagers that he was getting old, and of the three unfilial acts, having no descendants is the greatest. Therefore, he wanted to find a wife, but feared that it would be difficult to attract a young woman because of his old age. Fan Tinggui, a neighbor, offered to act as a matchmaker, saying that he had a niece, Zhao Di, who was 23 years old and still a virgin. If he did not mind her being unsophisticated, he was willing to arrange a marriage. Xu asked about the bride price, and Fan discussed it with him. As a result, they agreed on 130 yuan. On the 17th of this month, the bride entered the house and a new-style civilized wedding ceremony was actually held in the shed. A marriage certificate was signed, with Fan Tinggui as the witness. Unexpectedly, after the marriage, the bride was not a virgin. Xu did not mind. However, only ten days after the wedding, on the 28th of this month, the bride suddenly disappeared. Xu was shocked when he returned home. He believed that Fan Tinggui was clearly a "dove release," deceiving him and defrauding him of his money. Therefore, he brought Fan to the Sixth District Police Station, who turned him over to the local court for interrogation.</p>

<p>I am a young man who has neither brothers nor sisters, and is of marriageable age. Moreover, I am a descendant of both families. Therefore, my parents love me very much. After graduating from junior high school at the age of seventeen, I started to make a living in society. Therefore, my parents were very strict in choosing my marriage partner. As a result, either the girl from this family had a too short life, or the girl from that family had conflicting horoscopes, and none of them were suitable. This is because my family is still an old-fashioned family. It happened that my maternal uncle's eldest daughter was one year younger than me. Relatives had jokingly said when she was young that she would be my wife in the future. When I grew up, my aunt also asked me in person if I agreed. I replied that I was working outside and had achieved nothing, so I dared not talk about this important matter at this time (this was when I was eighteen). That's because I had already rejected it. Unexpectedly, my aunt came forward to bring up the old matter again. My uncle and aunt immediately agreed. However, I had one condition first. Please let her study for two years to gain some common knowledge. If there was a possibility of marriage, then we would get engaged. Unexpectedly, my uncle was also a stubborn person, and he did not agree. Although I strongly opposed it, I couldn't disobey my parents' orders, so I got engaged. I ignored it. The following year, I couldn't bear it any longer and carried out a family revolution. Later, my parents said that they had given birth to eight brothers and sisters, and now there is only you. Now that we are engaged to the daughter of your uncle's family, after she marries into the family, she will definitely be close to her aunt, and there is no reason why they cannot get along well. As parents, we will never do anything wrong. Furthermore, your cousin is also an old-fashioned woman. Now that we are engaged, if she suddenly regrets the marriage, outsiders will suspect that there is another reason, and there may be a matter of life or death. You should think about it. I temporarily took this into consideration and vaguely agreed, seeking to preserve things by compromising. Due to a moment's difference in thought, I have made a lifelong regret, and it is too late to regret it now. I got married last year, but within a month, there were constant conflicts, and there were two big fights, and even a case of swallowing gold to commit suicide. But it is not that I am good at fighting with her, but that her mouth is too garrulous. She asks when she shouldn't ask and doesn't ask when she should ask. I don't want to have meaningless arguments with her, so I ignore her, and she gets angry. After marriage, I have taught her to read novels and practice writing in large and small characters (because she had also read a few days of "Daughter's Classic" from a private tutor when she was young). Unexpectedly, she has never written a single word. I also don't like her behavior. She can't handle household chores either. After I finish work, I go home, sit for a while, and then go out. We have never exchanged three or five words. After the two big fights in the family, my parents also knew that her behavior was wrong and knew that a big mistake had been made and there was no way to undo it. They can only encourage me to work hard and find another wife for me in the future to comfort them. However, I will never do this because of the crime of bigamy, which is not a legitimate practice and is not allowed by current law. So now I simply live like a year, with nothing to look forward to. I only wish that one of us would die, then there would be a bright path to take. But that is not humanitarian. If I talk about divorce, then her uncle will not allow it. Therefore, I am deeply pessimistic. Life is boring and death is impossible. I am in a dilemma. If I cannot take a step back in the future, I will eventually commit suicide to end this miserable life. I am specifically stating the matter clearly to you and hope that you can indicate the most appropriate and fundamental solution, which will save a life and be better than building a seven-story pagoda. But there is absolutely no hope of reconciling, so I hope you can give me advice other than this.</p>
<p>(Reply) Life has its own meaning and important responsibilities. Is it worth it to be so concerned about a mere marriage problem? In ancient times, some people dedicated themselves to the country and did not want to have a family, or even if they had one, they did not want it. You have your own profession, and judging from your letter, you have considerable education. You can seek spiritual comfort and recreation elsewhere. If the family is peaceful, then let it be. Otherwise, let it be. If you can persuade her to change her unsatisfactory words and actions, that would be best. Otherwise, slowly let her realize it herself and implement the method of subtle influence from a psychological perspective. Perhaps as she gets older and her environment changes, she will naturally become aware. If you become pessimistic so quickly and even talk about suicide, you are taking life too lightly and family too seriously, forgetting the kindness of your parents giving birth to you and society raising you, and disregarding your heavenly duty. Only those with knowledge will sneer at you. As for divorce and bigamy, since they are not allowed by law, they will only cause trouble for yourself and increase disputes. You are right not to advocate them.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Robbery on Baker Road to Be Sentenced <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>At around 6 pm on the 14th of this month, the home of Xu Chunhua, an Erren [Shanghai slang for person from Ningbo], at No. 908 Baker Road, was robbed of valuables worth 193 yuan. The Chinese and Western detectives of the Huishan Police Station arrested the perpetrators, Sheng Wanxing, Wang Changyou, Jin A Bao, also known as Gengtang, and Zhang Axing and Li A Ming, Qingkou natives who supplied the firearms, along with suspect Wang Arong, and handed them over to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, the police sent the six suspects, including Sheng, to the Third Criminal Court for continued trial. According to the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin, the facts of the case were stated, and it was said that during the change of date, it was found that defendant Wang Arong was not related to the case and requested to be released. Then, the victim Xu Chunhua stated that the defendant Sheng Wanxing was indeed present at the scene of the robbery, but he could not identify the others. Sheng Wanxing confessed that he was invited by Zhou Genfu, a bald man on the run, to commit the robbery, and he was also the one who held the gun. Wang Changyou confessed that he was outside as a lookout at the time and did not enter the house. He received 13 yuan afterward. Jin Gengtang Hong and Zhou Genfu knew each other. They gathered and discussed the matter in a Huajie Road teahouse beforehand. The gun was also taken by him. He admitted that he went to commit the robbery. Li A Ming confessed that he knew a person on the run named A Shun, who had a Mauser pistol and asked him to exchange it for a handgun. Therefore, he asked Zhang Axing to find a way. He did not go to the robbery. Zhang Axing confessed that he was a road worker in the Shanghai Municipal Council and knew Li A Ming. The rest of his confession was evasive. Wang Arong confessed that he knew nothing about the robbery and was arrested by mistake. After Judge Shen Bingrong verified the confessions, he instructed the lawyers to make their arguments. He ordered that Wang Arong be released first, and the rest be returned to custody for sentencing at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Yan Ziyu Discusses Egg Product Registration Rules <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau announced the egg product registration rules, Mr. Yan Ziyu, manager of the China Central Cold Storage Plant, told people yesterday that according to the egg product foreign trade registration rules, six reputable companies in the same industry should be obtained as guarantors. However, there are only six ice egg companies in Shanghai. Except for one company that has registered with the government, the other four are purely foreign merchants. Chinese businessmen wanting to ask foreign merchants for a guarantee, the foreign merchants certainly wouldn't agree. Even if they do, it will damage the national dignity. Therefore, the factory has submitted a clear statement to the authorities, adding "but those guaranteed by two reputable non-industry merchants shall also be allowed to register" at the end of Article 2 of the rules, or changed to "the bureau will send personnel to the factory to guide and supervise the packing, and after the packing is completed, the ladder will be sealed, and the key will be kept by the bureau personnel, and it will be opened before export and transported to the warehouse, and the salary of the bureau personnel will be borne by the factory." This advance measure seems to be very appropriate, and it is hoped that the authorities can accommodate it.</p>
