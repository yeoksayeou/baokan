<p>五院正副院長由蔣提出重加選任</p>
<p>發表「爲撲滅赤匪告合國同胞書」</p>
<p>（南京）　第三届中央執行委員會第五次全體會議十五日上午八時、在中央黨部第一會議廳、舉行第三次大會、出席者中央執行委員葉楚傖·王柏齡·方覺慧·丁惟汾·周啓剛·楊樹莊·何成濬·于右任·張羣·朱培德·戴傳賢·王伯羣·王正廷·陳立夫·陳果夫·孔祥熙·朱家驊·蔣中正·宋子文·曾養甫·邵元冲、列席者候補中央執行委員劉文島·張道藩·克興額·程天放·余井塘·中央監察委員吳敬恒·張繼·蔡元培·候補中央監察委員陳布雷、主席于右任、討論事項如下、</p>
<p>（甲）　通過爲一致協力撲滅赤匪</p>
<p>告全國同胞書</p>
<p>「赤匪秉其殘忍之性、乘我社會之多故、倡亂迄今、忽逾數月、殺人放火、勢漸披猖、夫以中國文化之優美、民族之純良、總理遺訓之昭垂、本黨撥亂之往績論、捷伐所及撲滅何難、徒以軍事頻仍、使若輩得乘機嘯聚、閭閻窮困、使若輩得乘機勾煽、政府未盡剿治之能、民間未盡自衛之力、以致星星之火、若將燎原、鄂贛諸省、匪燄尤熾、本黨以解救民困爲職責、對於罹匪區域同胞之死亡流離、靡日不引爲疚痛、今政府决於匪禍已成之區、大舉師徒、尅期剿滅、於匪禍未成之區、積極清鄕、防其滋蔓、同時由本會訓令各級黨部、與地方政府、通力合作、同遏亂萌、示以方略、嚴其考成、如此悉國内之力以撲方張之寇、自可壁壘一新、殲此醜虜矣、但今赤匪之患、有如肺菌、其潛伏焉至深、其暴發焉至烈、且挾其一切殘酷伎倆、以臨吾鄉邑柔和之同胞、或有苟求寗息而不悟罹患益深者、爰就一致協力除惡務盡之義、爲吾同胞詳切言之、</p>
<p>其一、願吾同胞勿存徼倖之心理、今日國人皆已知赤禍之烈、而多數之住居於匪區以外者、猶以袖手旁觀之態、作幸不我及之想、不知赤匪之背後、旣有赤色帝國主義爲之發縱指示、其所欲得而甘心者、實爲我整個之民族、而其入手之方法、則在造成不可收拾之流寇、此時若不覺悟、則流竄所及、勢將同被其禍、此其一也、</p>
<p>其二、願吾同胞勿存畏怯之心理、赤匪之</p>

<p>所以造成空前恐怖、及採用所謂游擊式的暴動者、其目的即在震摇人心、脅制良善、使有所怯、而弗敢與抗、然後彼得逐漸以施其宰割、此中狡毒、最宜認清、須知天下事唯有决死之心、而後始有必生之望、唯有不奪之氣、而後始無可乘之機、赤匪實力本無足數、其在匪區以内、種種慘無人道之舉動、固由其殘暴性成亦欲以先聲脅人耳、我若燭其好謀、示之以不摇不惑之决心、無畏無却之奮鬥、則彼寡我衆、彼怯我定、彼虚我實、以石擊卵、殲之必矣、此其二也、</p>
<p>其三、願吾同胞勿存推諉之心理、今日國人羣知赤匪與我不兩立、然終以爲權不我操、責不我屬、征剿防守、軍隊主之、綏靖偵緝、官廳主之、於吾人民若無與焉、夫官廳軍隊職責所在、自無旁貸、但亦賴人民有自救之勇氣、自衛之决心、而收效以宏、譬如軍隊欲搜索殘匪、鄕民匿跡而不以報、政府方舉辦清鄕、村落知有匪而不敢以聞、則剿辦雖力、而肅清匪易、此其三也、</p>
<p>其四、願吾同胞勿存消極觀望之心理、多難興邦、古有明訓、自求多福、唯在人爲、赤匪之勢雖張、而其殘忍狠毒、毫無人理、被裹陷賊者、已日有覺悟、而羣思自新、曾被蹂躪者、亦奮志復仇、而誓不兩立、罪惡日昭、末日已近、吾同胞若能奮民族自衛之偉力、起而爲一心一德之驅除、凡區鎭鄕村之間、同盡守望相助之職、張網以伺、嚴陣以待、使匪出入無所遁形、奔走不得寗息、則根本撲滅、指顧可期、否則震其宣傳、惑其聲勢、徬徨待變、唯事咨嗟、苟安之望、未必終達、魚爛之勢、遂以形成、則正赤匪所求之不得者、此其四也、</p>
<p>右述四事、一黨非對同胞爲過量之求、實以國家興亡、匹夫有責、赤匪旣爲吾民族之大患、自非集全國一致之力量以撲滅之不可、本黨秉承總理遺敎、並受國民會議委託之重、靖難剿匪、自屬責無旁貸、而吾同胞亦必須以自救自强之心、盡衛國保種之力、或修繕保衛、安定閭閻、或敵愾同仇、協助剿伐、或糾正邪說、遏其披猖、或偵索匪踪、杜其隠伏、羣策羣力、咸以掃此妖藥爲急務、則豈有以四萬萬人之協力、而不能撲滅此賣國禍種之窮寇者、爰於告誡黨員、督責政府之外、對吾同胞、爲懇切之丁寗、唯吾全國同胞察焉、』</p>

<p>國際間所最重視之戰債與賠欵問題。世人皆注意於美法兩國政府这態度。以該問題不解决。則國際間之意見。不能消釋。而其關係最大者即德與美法也。今日德國中央黨發出通告。盼望賠欵問題從速解决。謂解决該問題。實所以免除德國及全歐之革命痛苦。尤望。全世界有理智人。未雨綢繆以免後悔云云。其言之足以驚心動魄而急切可見矣。</p>
<p>至美法兩國之態度。雖未有正式表示。然觀今日美副國務卿凱爾氏與法外長白里安氏之宣言。則該問題已有可以解决之望。塞氏謂美正府並不堅持賠欵與債戰之須完全分别。並於必要時將考慮應否暫加變動之方針云云。德報已重視其宣言。謂足以增加美國對德政治上之意味。白氏則謂彼所以竭力維護和平者。因法國有被人指爲擾亂和平之嫌。不得不排除萬難而力任之。又云德法邦交間近年來之誤會。不難於最近時期内袪除之。雖未明言賠欵問題。然賠欵問題之可以接近。不難於言外見之矣。吾故謂此等消息。皆值得世人注意者也。</p>

<h3>本校二十五週之回顧</h3>
<p>— 許民一</p>
<p>流光若駛，日月不居，世事滄桑，變幻靡定，凡事不進卽退，未有能中立者，我校自入世以來，轉瞬二十五週，猶孩提之童，已達成人艱辛年，血氣方剛，正有爲之秋，其間雖備歷艱辛，曾經一度停頓，然恢復後，長斯校者，咸能銳意經營，革新孟晋，卒能造成此莊嚴燦爛，國内唯一之華僑學府，屹立於上海眞如西鄕，但此二十五週中，不知已嘔却幾許人心之血，費却國家幾許公項，溯自前清光緒三十三年，兩江總督端方，奏准在南京薛家巷，假妙相庵，創立本校，第一任堂長，卽今之鄭校長也，翌年改辦中學，宣年三年，鄭堂長他調，繼任者爲江寗楊熙昌，是年三月，僕自南洋婆羅洲般遮嗎振歸國，偕回學生洪臨風鄭伯温二名，送之入校，下榻校中凡三日，得與楊堂長兇談，猶記其言曰，華僑子弟，性情剛强而直爽者多，苟能施以適當之敎育，收效必宏，異日均可爲國家樑棟之材、時校中僅有南洋諫議里，徐搏興獨資送回之學生二十餘人、及其他爪哇學生若干名，總數不逾三十，（徐博興爲爪哇諫議里，中華學校總理，回國參觀南洋勸業會，病歿上海）秋七月，僕應爪哇泗水華校電聘，重渡炎荒，抵泗後，兼辦荷屬學務總會，時獲楊堂長函告校務，囑代宣傅，當時有一最難措置之事，卽徐博興送回之學生二十餘名，因徐故後，無人供給費用，均須校中借給，不一載，已墊五千餘金，遂致校費大受影響，函電囑向各生家屬代索，卒未有一償還者，辛亥革命事起，校卽停辦，學生星散，有力者自行南旋，餘悉逗遛滬上，餐飱不給，急急不可終日，乃由華洋人壽公司，資遺回南，此可謂前清暨校史中一頁小掌故也，民國六年，袁希濤任敎育次長，始派黃炎培等，恢復暨南學校，（後黃俱爲黨務校董）七年春組成，部委趙正平爲校長，仍在妙相庵原址開學，八年春，僕自泗水歸，挈回學生吳淮清等十人，經趙校長錄取入校，分入師範商業中學等科，（現均畢業回南任事）時全校學生，已有三百名，規模觕具，九月，敎員柏君南遊，趙校長函邀到校代課，並主任文牘，此爲僕入校之始，九年夏，趙校長辭職，部委柯成　繼任，規畫校事，尤具熱忱，深得學生信仰，特派敎員赴北京敎育部國語傳習所，聽講國語註音，畢業回校，敎授師範生，十年秋，柯校長辭職，趙校長回任，呈准當局發行校債十萬元，在眞如買地三百餘畝，建築新校舍，並組織暨南新村，十二年秋落成，男子部悉行遷來，女生仍留寗校，僕亦隨之來滬，十三年江浙戰事起，校舍屯兵，全體遷避上海宜昌路，大有榨油公司，戰事雖劇，絃歌未徹，十四年秋，趙校長辭職，部委姜琦接任，因學生日多，添築宿舍一座，派員分赴菲列濱爪哇各埠募捐，結果所得捐欵，除開支外無甚盈餘，肇建圖書館，未及完成，十五年正月校舍又爲奉軍所據，全校學生，再遷避上海，始假西門第二師範，繼賃打浦橋新新里房屋開課，四月遷回，五月二十一日舉行本校二十週紀念，開遊藝會三日，以資慶祝，十六年夏，姜校長辭職，國民政府委令鄭校長繼任，改組爲國立暨南大學，南京女子部亦併入眞如，規模始臻宏大，十八年六月六日，在校開華僑敎育會議，國内及暹羅英荷法美各屬代表出席者，七十八人，歷時亘七晝夜，議决案四十有五，（刋南洋敎育會議報告）中外敎育家相聚一堂，討論敎育，此爲我國破天荒之剏舉，本年又經中國國民黨中央執行委員會議决，爲促進本校使成爲三民主議華僑最高學府起見，設立董事會，規定董事十一人，訂立章程，由中央執行委員會並敎育部批准，至建設方面，自圖書館落成後，次第又建築蓮　館，科學館，女生宿舍，敎職員宿舍，大禮堂，初高中宿舍，中學部課堂，及辦公室等，並借暨南村基地，建小洋房十三所，租賃與敎職員住宿，在規畫中者，尙有體育館等，不日亦將興工，又設立暨南銀行於校中，專管理學生出入欵項，現除中學部外，大學部已有文理法商敎育五院，共十八系，又外交師資兩專科，此外將義務小學，改爲實騐小學，隷屬本校，各屬之僑生負笈來遊著，多至一千三百餘人，而各埠來者，尙絡繹於途，惜限於宿舍，暫時未能儘量容納，又特設南洋美洲文化事業部，隨時與海外通訊，溝通中南消息，編輯定期雜誌，南洋研究，郵寄外洋敎育各機關，並編輯南洋叢書，已出版者！二十餘種，在編輯中者，尙有三十餘種，將陸續付印，設備方面，雖囿於經費，未獲充分完備，然亦勉敷應用，茲就圖書館言，中西書籍，已有三萬三千零五十冊，各科畢業學生之離校者，或爲黨國宣勞，或爲社會服務，軍政學商各界，無不有之，在南洋担任敎育者，聲譽尤隆，各校爭相羅致，經商而擁鉅資，握海外經濟權者，亦不乏人，國内銀行界，如上海和豐銀行總經理，即本校畢業生，其他如新華銀行等，均有本校學生，同學會之在國内者，如南京，廣州，汕頭，江西，濟南，靑島，武漢，均有會所，國外若暹羅，仰光，新加坡，吉隆坡，馬尼拉等處，亦均有焉，本年上海同學會，已請鄭校長在眞如撥地兩畝，爲建築會所之用，繪就圖樣，行將興建，將來落成，爲辦公及招持回國華僑之用，體育一部，在國内旣獲得相當榮譽，並於十七年及本年，兩度南征，第一次至馬來半島，暹羅，安南，第二次至菲列濱，師途又至廣州比賽，在外洋各埠比賽時，不特獲奬獎甚多，且足以表揚我國體育進步，使外人敬佩，增高國際地位，一洗東亞病夫之誚，餘如留學他邦，得博士學位者，在上海執行律師業務，兼任母校敎員者，專充敎員者，尙有在外留學未歸者，人材輩出，寔爲吾校之光，在此短促期間，校務發達，有此偉大成績，不可謂非難能可貴，然鄭校長猶以爲未足，尙擬將中學部遷回南京，以便從事擴充，又擬在鎭江等處，購地數百畝，闢一最大農場，就地設立一完全農科，培植農學人材，俾學成南旋，有豐富之墾植學識經騐，得與異族，在農業上競爭，果爾則吾校前途光大，未可限量，余濫竽本校，忽忽十有二稔，自慚謭陋，毫無建樹，現值二十五週，及完成大學四週紀念，爰就所知，撮其槪要，拉雜書此，以寔紀念日刋，爲時倉猝，錯誤遺漏，悉所不免，惟所悵觸者，昔時同事，已寥若晨星，殊不不觀，今之晨夕相晤者，僅有三人，（内二人曾離校一次）餘或轉入政商，或移硯他方，眷懷舊雨，不禁有渭北江東之思，然較之東西各國之敎育家，不以敎育爲清苦，孜孜不倦，引爲終身事業者，志趣似屬不同，或云我國社會環境，與他邦逈殊，環境旣異，勢難强同，安得謂爲敎育家之見異思遷而無恒也，其然乎，豈其然乎，併書於此，以誌吾感</p>

<h3>嫁後絮語</h3>
<p>— （福璿）</p>
<p>——勗畢業諸君并勵在校同學——</p>
<p>今日爲本校創校廿五週年；及大學四週年完成紀念之期。於事，則籌備久遠，萬千儀象，待啟幕於崇階。於文，則前者有紀念冊之刋行，以彰其盛。後者有各院部之報告，以叙其詳。吾人於此，無類喋喋。獨聞盛會之中。復有十八年度畢業禮典之補行。考畢業同學，非繼續研究，即出而問世。繼續研究者暫勿置論。出而問世者，論者比之閨女之出閣。其言曰：「閨女出閣，遇人淑醜，終身所繫。姑翁仁惡，幸福所關。一旦歸寗，與諸姑娣妹父母兄弟叙，談話之資料必多。然柔情夫婿未强求，姑惡厲容每易見。於是怨聲多而韻事少，强顏殷而泣哭頻矣。人生至此，始覺處世之未易。非傷人情之險巇，即嘆事奉之術窮。離校入世，如出一轍。就業，從夫也。社會，姑翁也。際茲經濟暴落，靑年慾奢之時，能滿其職守者蓋稀。」予應之曰。『此乃昔日之情形。夫閨女出閣，夫婿良否？究有所屬。今之離校問世者，則如閨女被逐，前途渺茫。進無業可爲。退無家可守。卽或偶得枝棲，非折節相就，即用非所學。以此自遺，味同嚼蠟。亦如舊式女子，厄於禮法，迫於嚴威，委身相就，焉有不怨聲載道者乎！今畢業諸君，或遇快婿·欣然自喜；或强身相就，悲輩眉宇；或問字無人，空房自嘆。一旦重回母校，與諸姑姊妹談世事。嘻笑怒駡泣哭慰怨之聲，必雜出於窗櫑之間。對斯盛會，其感喟當非筆墨所能形容者矣。回憶昔日在校時之騁懷在我，修藏自得，友情融洽、師生義深者，當依依不忍復離校門也。</p>
<p>雖然，吾等離校，憂樂所遭，雖各不同；感喟亦各緣情而異。然有數事，不可以不詳。中國目前社會之動摇，千孔百瘡，無可諱言。靑年苦悶，不一而足，出路之難，更非一言可盡。要其旨歸，由於社會之形成者半，由於本身之迷誤者亦半：</p>
<p>社會醜惡之面目，偶涉世故者，類能道其詳。謀事，則以阿諛謟媚爲前導，奔走逢迎爲進階。黠者譏爲卑鄙候門。直者誚爲鑿柄書獃。抱志勵節者，每多徬徨道左，縱有幹才，無所用之，於是怨起家庭，評加社會，高級游民，曷敢自辯。所謂蒲輪之召，枉道之迎，已絶跡於今日。</p>
<p>偶或巧有機緣，得有所就矣。戰戰競競，惟恐失之。勤於任事者，左右以「結好」爲談笑之資料。偶疏職守者，上司以「玩職」爲斥責之呵駡。庸懦者，同事笑爲尸餐。幹練者，上下互相排躋。友情變爲寇讐，戚屬亦相水火。候事於門者，且日有讒佞之進，取而代之之伺。况人心不同，各如其面。外相誇獎，内實陰圖。吾人於此，彷如五里霧中。爲福爲禍，變幻莫測。任事之難，於斯可見。矧上所述，未足以盡其萬一乎！至於社會之黑暗，道德之淪喪，入焉不染者，尤屬萬難。前者以此相召，後者以此相逐，好習成風，殊堪痛哭。此社會醜惡之面目，足令吾人之進退維谷者也。</p>
<p>（二）　在校同學稔知稼穑之艱難者少、習於奢豪之生活者多。每以爲社會之事事物物，創之甚易。好爲空闊这高調，鄙習實際之技能。甚且理想樓臺，以爲畢業今朝，夕登仕域，臯比坐於高堂，顯赭耀於宇内。一旦入世，截然殊途。職卑者不肯敢節相就，事大者未能克任其勞。况又用非所學，工大效微者乎！於是頽廢者流於消極，過激者走於極端。社會益以亂，進退益以難，此吾人本身所應負之責任者一也。</p>
<p>若夫　舍之内，等於逆旅。曠課者以『超然』相標榜；勤業者以『書畫』相厲颧。『時髦』爲夢寐之心願，『亨樂』爲理想之樂園。一旦離校就業，非乾燥無味，不安於職；即學無專長，御事乏術；不得不繼之以詐巧，冀幸苟存。於是剛者亢，而弱者折矣。社會益以亂，進退益以難，此吾人本身所應負之責任者又其一也。</p>
<p>今諸君回聚一堂，所見所感，未必盡如上言，然上述種種，皆爲社會醜惡之面目，則不可掩飾。雖然，往者已矣，來者可勉，畢業同學，旣身嘗其苦，當不忍在校同學，重蹈其咎。則宜以經騐之談，互相規戒，藉資準備，是亦嫁後歸寗所應有之訓囑也；因以勗在校之同學曰：</p>
<p>「諸君多屬未婚之身，待字閨人。數年之後，爲出閣，爲被逐，今尙未知。然故世之方，不可以不明，社會洶洶，人情莫測。應對進退，宜如何準備？以免激隨之譏，徬徨之　。就學擇業如何自勵？以免扞格於用，力疲於勞。方不至洗手入廚，未諳姑食也。」</p>
<p>予畢業未久，留校服務。無殊　婚母家，未出閣門。風塵之苦，僅償萬一。勺　之言，或爲識者所笑。特興感所及，略述其詳。爲紀念特刋之補白耳。　六月十四日</p>

<p>第二幹事會一瞥</p>
<p>緣起　本幹事會，掌理成績展覽事宜，實紀念會中最有最有興趣而又最困難之一事。蓋本校剏辦雖已念五週年，改組大學不過四載。雖得鄭榏長之苦心規畫，及社會人士之同情贊助，日就月將，孜孜研讀。然其所得，何足與國内外各著名先進大學相姽美。而又不敢自秘，謹乘茲會，略貢所知，以求敎育先進與乎社會人士之指導與批評，俾作南釬，用資策勵。斯則本幹事會之所希企者也。</p>
<p>人員　本幹事會以全校各學院院長及註冊課課長爲主幹，大學部全體師生，並致力焉</p>
<p>地點　成績展覽地點，原　在圖書館。旋以該館地方較狭，恐不敷用，　决定改用科學館全部爲成績展覽館。斯館樓共三層，室嗣四十，建築位在全校中心，四週花木扶疏，薰風冉冉。參觀諸君，蒞館指敎，或不致爲煩熱所困乎。陳列各室，有如左列。</p>

<p>結論　本幹事會籌備成績，雖云繁瑣。顧以經費有限，時間短促，一切未克如願貢獻，加以科學館原爲理科試騐室，未能完全應用，佈置誠恐不週，參觀諸君，尙希鑒諒爲荷。</p>

<h3>國貨商塲被封案楊肇熉訪費信惇</h3>
<p>商場部分即可啓封</p>
<p>游藝部分暫時停閉</p>
<p>中華國產商場、自九日下午、突被捕房封閉後、全滬市民、對於工部局此舉、深訝爲不合法律手續、因縱使該商場有違警之處、工部局應依照協定、向特區地方法院提起公訴、由法院依法裁判、不宜逕自封閉、致蹈越分之嫌而侵我國法院權限、特區地方法院院長楊肇熉氏、以爲工部局與特區法院、平日事事均能合作、而此次竟發生不幸事件、殊覺遺憾、尤以此事有關市民之權利及法院之權限、爲免糾紛擴大計、特出爲質問、以期早日解决、遂向工部局代表律師、表示意見、工部局代表律師方面、因權限所關、未便過問、楊院長即於昨日上乖親往工部局訪總辦費信惇氏、當面提出抗議、並要求即日將該塲啓封、費氏表示、已亦認此舉不無錯誤之處、但聲明事前本人及董事會、均未得悉、至於國產商塲一部分、即可啓封、照常營業、惟遊藝部分、因設備不全、因火警危險性質、須俟該塲設置完備後、方可啓封、楊院長當即表示須全部啓封、如有違警之處、儘可移送法院辦理、費氏表示、此層本人無權允許、惟可將此層報告董事會議、由董事會商議補救辦法、諒不難圓滿解决、並稱即日（十五日）下午、召集臨時董事會談話會、以便我從速了結、楊院長以費氏所答、尙有誠意、遂告辭、嗣聞董事會臨時談話會、昨日不及召集、已改至星期三（即十七日）召集、故此事大致須俟明日董事會開會後、方可解决、而國產商塲、至早亦須至十八日始有啓封之望也、</p>
<h3>費信惇談封閉國產商塲原因</h3>
<p>云爲保護市民生命安全</p>
<p>昨日下午三時半左右、記者與工部局總裁費信惇、會晤於該局辦公室、費氏對於最近國產商塲之封閉問題、作後列之表示、以下爲費氏談話、</p>
<p>自國產商場封閉後、一般報紙所載、與事實相差頗遠、蓋工部局自始迄今、不特無反對國產貨品之意、且以爲國產貨品、質美價廉、亟應加以提倡、惟提倡國產品爲一事、保全一般顧客之生命安全、則又是一事、二者絶對不容相混、憶國產商場在市政廳開辦時、塲中儲有易於引火之燃料甚多、本局救火會當局、與該塲執事張君、交涉數次、告以取締之理由、并予以相當之期限、勒令按照條例改臯、顧終不之顧、比該局遷至新世界後、情形更爲惡劣、除商場外、并設有游戲塲及電影場等、其中安全設備、多與本局所規定之條例不符、設一旦發生不測、（如火警等）則場中游客衆多、數百生命、將同歸於盡、本局爲保護市民生命之安全起見、安能目睹其危險情狀之發見、而默然不爲之先事設法糾正　此該塲封閉原因之所由起也、現本局之意、以爲國產商塲、可以先行准予營業、惟游藝部分、則須俟太平門及其他設備完全後、方可恢復云、</p>
<h3>交通部布告揚子碼頭禁泊輪船</h3>
<p>因游洋社不付租金之故</p>

<h3>顯有姦情之滬西暗殺案</h3>
<p>一男屍刀傷四處</p>
<p>陽具亦完全割去</p>
<p>昨日上午八時三刻左右、滬西小沙渡路石灰窑附近荒叢内、忽然發現被人暗殺無名男屍一口、週身共受刀傷四處、最可怪者、死者陽具亦被割去、厥狀至慘、茲將詳情分述於次、</p>
<p>發現謀斃男屍　滬西小沙渡石灰窑後面地屬四·六兩區轄境、荒偋異常、故附近祇有江北貧苦客民搭就之草棚十數家、行人足跡罕至、昨日上午八時半左右、該處突然發現被人謀斃之男屍一口、當爲附近居民瞥見、覩狀大駭、立即奔告四區派出之巡邏警、該警等以彼處地屬六區轄境、復轉報六區派出所、由巡長胡履中具報六區總署、</p>
<p>陽具根本剷除　任區長據報後、立即率同巡官徐濤、及偵緝員劉少卿等、蒞塲察勘一週、查得該男屍年約三十左右、微麻、身御灰色嗶嘰長裱、内襯白紡綢衫袴、元嗶嘰圓頭鞋、赤足無襪、屍旁棄有元紗小瓜皮帽、身畔並無别物、頭部被刀截成一洞、此外後頸左腿各有刀創一處、均深約寸許、所可怪者、即下部陽具睪丸、竟被根本剷除、血肉糢糊、不忍卒覩、惟地上遺有顯明之血跡、乃循跡而尋、直至四區轄境之福新第三廠後面爲止、估計與屍身距離、約有八百米達之遥、</p>
<p>法院派員相騐　任區長勘畢後、即飭令所屬限日緝拿兇犯、一面飭傳該圖地保投報地方法院請騐、至下午三時許、法院特委派楊文濬檢察官帶同書記官檢騐吏蒞塲騐明、騐得該無名男屍委係生前被人用刀謀害斃命、查無家屬、隨令地保報堂收殮、候緝獲兇手究辦、</p>
<p>内容顯有姦情　綜觀上述情狀臆測、死者衣冠整齊、何以僅裸赤兩足而又着鞋、兇手旣將死者截斃、因認爲目的已達、而必欲割去其陽具、則内容含有姦情、顯而易見、且血跡起點係在福新廠之後面、更足證明兇手將死者謀斃後、棄屍於荒僻之所、故作疑陳、初不料途中遺有血跡也、因此則本案之破獲、僅時間問題耳</p>

<h3>熊司令讌客籌賑瑣記</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>熊天翼司令。因勸募贛災振欵。特於將隨蔣主席赴贛勦共之前。抽睱回滬。於十三日晚假座市商會。招待各業領袖。大槪情形。已見次日本報。爰將各報之未詳者。補誌如下。</p>
<p>是晚公宴時刻。原定六時。予準時前往。石梯旁設簽到處。由王培元醫士術銳鋒秘書。與紅十字會淞滬警備司令部各職員。殷勤招待至三樓休憇。計分三處。一常會室。二會客廳。三洋臺上。是日天氣奇熱。洋臺上較風凉。故皆趨往。熊司令蒞會後。在二樓會客室。與王曉籟許靜仁王一亭社月笙張嘯林等。商議乘北平名角在滬未去之際。請其唱義務戲數天以籌賑。少頃入席。席設大禮堂。分五排。每排五桌。均係圓臺。菜由覺林蔬食處承辦。熊司令導來賓入禮堂時。笑容滿面。頻頻頷首爲禮。杜月笙乘此與各來賓握手。而表示此次家祠落成。客多招待不週之意。中央靠北一桌爲首席。熊司令請許世英王一亭虞洽卿杜月笙張嘯林王曉籟諸君共坐此席。其他史量才黃涵之吳藴齋聞蘭亭林康侯鄭澄清鄔志豪陸祺生等圍坐第二席。先上菜饅頭一大盆。來賓　食後。許世英以箸聲杯。王曉籟鼓掌相和。熊司令乃起立報告贛災情狀。此之爲流行感冒病。如不救。恐將蔓延至江浙兩省。而達全國。語甚剴切。聽者動容。張嘯林聽熊司令報告至江西匪徒對於三十歲以上。及有五百元財產。與智識階級中人。均要殺戳等語。不禁脫口而出。謂然則今晚在座同人。俱有被殺資格矣。衆皆咋舌。許世英謂鄙人因任賑務會主席關係。所得贛災消息較確。諸君前看陜災影片。已悲痛飲泣。豈料贛災較陜尤重。一則尙有人前往查災。設法救濟。一則恐爲共匪所害。無人敢出資埋葬暴露之屍。以及垂斃之民。七十三縣遍地荒凉。數十里無人烟。慘不忍睹。諸君捐洋一元。即能救一命。救人即救己。冥冥中報應不爽。虞洽卿謂上海近來對於廣東情形。咸注意而恐慌。不知廣東不成問題。江西爲江浙隣省。如無辦法。其禍害遠在廣東之上。請解襄相助。聞蘭亭主請到會者爲勸募委員後。即由鄔志豪鄭澄清等分隊手持捐冊號簿。親向各桌分送。即席均贈「贛災一瞥」小冊一。内印被匪焚刦後之相片頗多。當塲認捐者甚衆。以周湘雲周純卿合認五千元爲最鉅。九時散席。握管爲記。</p>
<h3>淮河吟</h3>

<p>民國二十年六月、視察淮河游中作此、留鴻爪焉。</p>
<p>長江長兮黃河黃。淮河位中央。西自桐柏東海疆。山洪發兮一片汪洋。旱魃臨兮四野災荒。老弱溝壑兮壯走四方。孰盡力於溝洫兮。使之物阜而民康。</p>

<h3>蠟美人談</h3>
<p>— 靑門居士</p>
<p>蠟製美人首。爲一種藝術品。製者必於人體骨骼及肌肉之組織。具有充分的審美觀念。并於雕刻繪像有得心應手之能力。始能勝任。而材料之配合。尤須熟諳理化。第一須令成品能在日光中電燈下。不致受熱熔融。故其熔點至少須在法倫氏表百度以上。第二須令膚色瑩然如玉。而無油光及斑點瑕疵。關於此點。最難把握。因其出胎時。不過粗具模型。略顯凹凸。全賴奏刀削斵乃得出相。如因天氣之寒温燥濕有所變化。即其凝固點有所不同。往往有如礬石一般。表裏精粗。不能貫澈一致。發見瑕疵。絶無補救之法。而修斵之工。亦即因而判其止境。是以歐美所製。其價乃自美金百餘百起至五六百元不等。大致約分五等。普通者爲紙質敷粉。眉眼均係筆畫。值美金八十元。蠟製者裝配眉眼。而睫毛仍係筆畫。眼球亦爲蠟製。惟眼珠係凸玻璃耳。其價已較普通一倍。大都面有瘢痕。不可逼視。咸擬爲電燈光下之野雞。可謂絶妙之品評。若其膚色瑩潔娟好如畫中人者。則其價值恒在三四倍間。如其形似礬石。裝嵌醫科義眼者。竟值美金六百元之鉅。合銀二千餘兩。亦可驚矣。其最廉者。爲東方式之古畫美人。全身不過廿元而已。中國製者。曩惟桑棟臣爲能手。惜其所用原料。非蠟故眉目如畫。非不嬌好。而皮膚色澤。終覺了無生氣。予嘗歎爲盡美而未盡善。不解何以不能用蠟。及今始知蠟製之不可恃。有如上述種種困難。因不若泥塑紙糊之可由自主耳。惟惠山泥塑人頭。其價亦需三十餘元。新北門一帶之佛像作所製人頭。價亦不廉。其第一短處。即望而知爲泥塑木雕之死相。吾嘗詢之銅像雕刻家何不製此。不知銅像之值。最低者亦須四五千金。同一費工。故不屑爲此等瑣細。是無足怪也。吾每自恨未嘗習畫。僅能製造蠟果。而不能製蠟美人頭。數年物色。頗欲得一合作之人。卒未能遇。一昨偶訪天虚我生於香雪樓。則彼方於旋轉架上。以刀削製蠟美人首。予因詫笑以爲奇事。及細詢之。乃其介弟蓉軒所作。因自無錫運滬。已有磕損。故爲改消成較瘦之面龐。而肌膚轉形瑩潔。其人如玉。洵稱盡美盡善。詢期代價。則僅六十元至百廿元耳。其等差亦以蠟質之凝固狀態爲衡。若配全身。則加半數。吾因贊歎不置。乞許留一照像。以作破天荒之紀念。</p>
<p>像成而後。見者莫不誤認爲眞。亦可見其神乎技矣。照像凡二。甲爲蓉軒原製。乙爲天虚我生改作。陳列於新世界之國產商場。絶似攣生姊妹。不過環肥燕瘦之分耳。或謂蓉軒所製絶似小楊月樓。而鬈髮如雲。俱經電熨。則爲小翠女士所作云。</p>
<p>出版消息　國立曁大大夏大學中大商學院等校敎授施伯珩君主編之「商業月刋」。其「創刋號」現已出版。内容豐富。有馬寅初王澹如劉仲廉諸君文字十三篇。尤以一月來日報商業大事分類索引爲特色。聞該刋由上海西門外安滬路瑞慶里商業珠算學社發行。定價每冊二角。預定全年二元。國外三元。並有贈品云。</p>
<h3>杜祠堂會寫眞</h3>
<p>— 錢華</p>
<p>杜月笙先生浦東高橋宗祠落成典禮。於六月九日十日十一日舉行盛大堂會三日。會集南北名仱。梅尙程荀四大名旦。及楊小樓。襲雲甫。王又宸。馬連良。譚小培父子。王少樓。高慶奎。言菊朋。等莫不參與。可謂滬上空前未有之會串。賓客日以數萬計。高橋道上。冠蓋如雲。</p>
<p>小車風光　由高橋渡頭至杜祠。尙有十里之遥。社宅備有小汽車數十輛。黃包車一百五十輛。接客迎送。但杯水車薪。無濟於事。多數仍徒步往來。間有中途截得數輛黃包車者。羣視爲幸運之神光臨。雖索價奇昂。單程自一元至三四元不等。亦樂於解襄。鄕間之獨輪小車。於是生涯大盛應接不暇。單程亦需一元。摩登盛裝女子踞坐其上。另有一種風光。多謂此生係第一次嘗試也</p>
<p>人氣白熱　劇塲廣可容數千人。但觀者近萬。幾無插足地。加以天熱塲低。四圍密不通風。觀衆揮扇觀劇。莫不汗流浹背。全塲空氣。異常混濁。人氣白熱化五字。形容最爲恰當。如上由張嘯林。王曉籟兩君維持秩序。卒亦無法驅散台上觀客。入晚客復陸續而來。跋涉十餘里。畏難而退者日必數千人。貴賓席中。佔有位置者。雖極視聽之樂。但兀坐通宵。呼吸急促。頭痛欲裂。一身不能轉側。大有欲罷不得之勢。誠有說不出之痛苦也。</p>
<p>最有精彩　三天劇目以第二天（即十日）最有精彩。如李吉瑞之獨木關。小小桂元打鼓駡曹。徐碧雲花木蘭。李萬春藍月春之兩將軍。程艷秋貫大元駡殿。劉宗楊安天會。王少根華慧麟坐宮。王又宸賣馬。楊小樓雪艷琴之長板坡。最後殿以梅尙荀雪壟馬之全部紅鬃烈馬。配搭整齊。可嘆觀止。</p>
<p>各劇略評　程艷秋之駡殿。久著盛名。是晚更爲賣力。歌喉婉轉。抑揚頓挫。博得一片彩聲。劉宗楊爲查小樓唯一愛徒。演安天會。頗有幾分似處。王少樓之坐宮。幾大段唱功。均臻上乘。流水與賢公主一段原板尤佳。王又宸賣馬。爲是晚最受歡迎之一劇。王之神情做派逼肖當年呌天。嗓音清甜。吐字堅實。店主東一段。一句一彩。確是爐火純靑。超凡入聖之作。楊小樓之長板坡。婦孺聞名。配以高慶奎之劉備。雪艷琴之糜夫人。劉硯亭之張飛。益覽生色。但抓帔一塲手足未見乾凈。可謂美中不足。最後全本紅鬃列馬。徐碧雲首唱彩樓配。繼以尙小雲三擊掌。麒麟童王芸芳之别窑。郭仲衡蓉草之趕三關。梅蘭芳譚富英言菊朋合唱武家坡。譚小培雪艷琴之算糧。譚小培荀慧生姜妙香之銀空山。結局梅蘭芳荀慧生襲雲甫馬連良之大登殿。此劇配搭整齊。合四大名旦於一爐。自首至尾。精神一貫。不特可稱空前。即謂爲絶後。亦無不可。</p>

<h3>三個時代（七）</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>（三）天橋的演說家</p>
<p>張小三兒沒了家小。他不但不感到什麽寂寞。反覺得自由。除了自己吃喝而外。並不用得掛念着家裏。又是一天。拉了兩筆買賣。有了錢。不跑了。老早的交了車。便到天橋來溜躂。天橋對於下等社會。是個擴大的百貨商場與游戲塲。可以說要什麽有什麽。遍處是破蘆蓆棚子。遍處是尿臊屎臭。自然有許多人沉醉在那裏。張小三兒也是個迷戀天橋的人。尤其是小馬五的梆子花旦。他崇拜到二十四分。他一到天橋。打聽得小馬五今天唱紡棉花。好極了。赶緊向那蘆蓆棚子舞台門口一跑。可是那裏頭的人。正向外湧。說是放脚的地方都沒有了。他擠進去看看。可不是。很無聊的走出來。也不知道向那兒走去好。很不經意的走着。雲裏飛的相聲。耍狗熊的一人班。都擠在人圈子裏看了一看。偶然横過大街。只見一面小白旗在人頭上飄蕩。旗下便圍着一叢人。張小三兒一想。這也許是個什麽新鮮玩意兒。霽上前去看看吧。他霽進了人叢。只見兩個穿灰色制服的軍人。站在人中間。一個拿着旗。一個捧了兩隻胳膊。站在那裏說。說的時候。許多人跟着他笑。他二人身後。還有一個大花子。那是老在街上碰見他要飯的。另外兩個人。一個是十五六歲的小孩。一個是四五十歲的漢子。只瞧他身上穿的白褂子。沒了兩個半截袖。而且染着灰黑色。準是一個拉車的了。那幾個人却是低了頭一聲不響。不像其餘的人。聽得那樣高興。那個演說的兵。倒是不舍糊。他帶比帶說。見張小三兒進來了。望了他一望。笑道。「這又來一個。我猜也是沒有閙兒的。你們沒事的不用說。就是有事的。也沒當兵這樣快活。一天兩操三堂課完了。咱們就是睡覺。作買賣。賣力氣。都得愁今天飯錢那兒出。當兵的沒這回事。聽了吹號就吃飯。走出來坐電車不買票。坐火車也不買票。愛上那兒。上那兒。沒穿軍衣。溜進戲館子去。聽蹭戲多麽寒塵。穿了軍衣。我們有優待座。咱廳了幾年戲。那個名角兒沒瞧過。可沒花過一個大。說到逛窑子。哈哈……」</p>

<p>昨日匯豐掛牌各匯一無更動、蓋前天英銀無升、美銀勿更、故滬市不爲所動、殆銀行内盤初平後堅、金市由平復鋒、下午平穏、標金雖昂、實被掉期激高也、然各匯並不過緊、迨結果比較上週末、計英金略縮零六二五、美金縮一二五、日金加一分、華商金業中亦無大宗交易、惟稍有出納、計英金約成交十餘萬鎊、銀行尙感賣出、又美金約結進二十萬元、而日金由大連帮扒進數十萬元、現大連乃日商銀行售出也、市况趨勢和平、惟印匯長而復縮、至大條銀今天（十六日）或有回低歟、</p>
<p>英匯　内盤僅以一一一五升降、銀行出價最緊一先令二便士一八七五、最鬆三一二五、上午對做九月三一二五、三井吸七月三一二五、十點時住友吸八月同價、十一點後匯豐出二五、午收出價一八七五、進價吸五一下午　比儧　五做七月一八七五、三點半後三井出七八月一八七五至二五、收市出價一八七五、買價二五、</p>

<p>東匯　内盤計有一分外差次、早市出價一兩七錢零七五、買價一兩七錢零二五、台灣出現大連一兩七錢一分、午收出價一兩七錢一分二五、買價一兩七錢零七五、下午三井出一兩七錢二分七五、三井出同價、收市出價一兩七錢二分、買價一兩七錢一分半云、</p>
<h3>周一又值比期</h3>
<p>銀洋收解略形繁忙</p>
<p>昨日旣爲星期一、銀行開關、營業狀况似較平時增多、而又值十五比期、錢莊方面收解尤爲紛紜、故銀錢業昨日氣象、頗不示弱、但市塲中價格、大都無甚區别、洋厘軒輊至微、銀拆則復低候、此項現象、爲必經之境遇耳、</p>
<p>釐早午同拆差一分、（洋厘）早午市同爲七錢二分六厘六毫二忽半、較前日午市雖好三毫七忽半、然較前日早市似反小去一毫二忽半、（銀拆）早市四分、午市五分、較前日双復回落五六分、蓋前日星期、銀行封關、頭襯支絀、昨則已平復如常、制頭加水初爲三四分、旋到過七八分、最後仍不過三四分而已、</p>
<p>角洋彷彿銅元放長　江南小洋、早午兩市同爲六錢四分七厘半、較前日略好半厘、做出交易、亦祇早市四千五百角、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢、四分六厘、午市爲六錢四分五角、結果較前午小去一厘八毫七忽半、做出交易、早市十萬○五千角、午市二萬角、銅元改長一千五百文、爲三百七十八千文、</p>
<p>銀洋進出大體俱忙、（銀欵）昨日銀行收解消息、較平時孔多、華商收解票欵二百八九十萬、外商收解票欵二百六十餘萬、特欵收解一百二十餘萬、各種貨滙稅什諸欵收解一千○八九十萬、押欵交易五六十萬、進倉八十萬、出倉一百萬、日商銀行收解各欵五百四十餘萬、進倉六十萬、錢蔣銀公單收解五千五百餘萬、劃頭欵收解五百二十餘萬、各路洪滙收解一百二十餘萬、解出現欵三四十萬、（洋欵）匯劃票欵、早市做出一百八十六萬、午市一百六十六萬、鈔票早市十萬○五千、午市五萬五千、塲外鈔票早市十八萬五千、午市九萬、銀行買賣、早市互市七十萬、午市五十五萬、各銀行洋戶往來收解一百八十餘萬、鈔票進出二百十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解六百三四十萬、洋劃頭欵收解二百四五十萬、折借洋欵一百六七十萬、小錢莊交易七八十萬、</p>
<p>證劵　二○捲期貨續漲停拍</p>
<p>其他亦漲一元數角至三四元</p>
<p>市况旺盛成交二千六百餘萬</p>
<p>昨各債期現貨市况、現貨祇做開整六編遣兩種、期市殊見緊張、上漲猛烈、在晨開躍漲數元、次盤尤勁、致干二○捲六七月期及二○關裁兵等七月期、感紛紛漲達限價停拍、後市至四時始開拍、遂僅有一盤市面、趨勢較前穏和、結果除九六關稅僅漲半地左右、整六漲一元三四角外、其他均續漲三四元、計期貨交易上午一千七百九十餘萬、後市一盤八百數十萬元、又現貨交易共僅三千元、</p>

<p>紗花　紗銷愈見發達</p>
<p>客銷六千零二十五包</p>
<p>棉紗實需益覺暢達、川帮採辦異常踴躍、且買去本紗爲多、故市價日見上漲、而時局消息良好、金價又見奔騰、致人心愈堅、故後市遂能趨漲、惟多數賣方、以海外狀况尙屬平澹、及粗紗走銷仍滯、心思尙軟、毫無扒空之念、所以現紗銷勢雖旺、標紗未能有大漲之力、不過現銷如繼續不斷、前途當有極大變化發現也、</p>
<p>人標漲一兩外　人標前市開盤、市氣平平、各月微漲二四錢、午後聞現銷興奮、金價上漲、政局消息良好、上漲八九錢至一兩二三錢、全日成交計一萬七千七百包、查賣出信誠一千六百五十包、大昶六百五十包、益昶六百五十包、大孚七百包、買進貨豐二千四百包、愼記九百五十包、頣大六百包、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市平靜</h3>
<p>棉市平靜、晨疲午漲、但海外棉市仍軟、人心不振、午後以金價又見奔騰、同時紗市又佳、略爲帶漲一些、惟市况極爲平澹、無甚大精彩可云</p>
<p>漢標些微上落　漢標前市隨外棉不佳、跌五分至一錢、午後稍漲一錢五分、全日成交計一萬八千一萬擔、查賣出公泰九百擔、愼記七百擔、買進愼大七百擔、天隆七百擔、振大五百擔、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>英印棉業週訊</h3>
<p>孟買　上週市價隨美棉爲上落、紐市價雖較小、然孟買套頭之變動亦小、孟買市塲中並無疲軟之象、統計情形繼續堅固、現需頗暢、本地廠家已進雜棉不少、歐洲出口商之交易靜寂、日商購買奧姆辣及甘地虛、上海方面、運去奧姆辣及平果爾甚多、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<p>利物浦　上週現貨交易較暢、期貨方面、自見新低價後、人心漸佳、市價上落較小、週末尤形堅定、埃及棉隨海外市塲爲轉移、週末隨美棉消息而漸見起色、</p>
<p>糧食　杜尖最挺厚粳平定</p>
<p>閘北　昨日米市尙未團暢、因裏路市面清懈、但本城存貨尙多、河市難以振作、早晨臨市人數尙不過鮮、然以探訊消息者爲多、去胃因難以加妤、常錫北粳站穏、中檔貨略動、故價喊起一尺、薄稻及早稻依然不見回定、杜尖銷路較暢、故價獨緊、洋埠尖次色見疲、糯米無特殊上落、陰化亦平定、客尖本街買進尙不過弱、價格堅定、</p>
<p>滬南　昨日市氣甚佳、臨市人數尙旺、河下斛脚尙可、因天時陰雨、且到貨漸稀、又聞北市轉鮮、人心傾向、頓然提昂、行胃亦薄、時值農忙之際、產地不易搬運、行情驟然喝起、高厚粳竟提兩角、薄稻到頭略稀、惟河積宿貨約二三十號、寗胃零星、本街揀取鮮高而已、中次仍然有限、致價亦增角外、洋杜尖到銷二平、市無榮辱、變陰元逐日節需不弱、市况亦亦緊角許、</p>
<h3>遠月粉稍落</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、初因洋麥報價好起一二角左右、人心曾一度堅定、較前週末收盤、似見微好、惟以後因内地帮之心思轉虛、售戶逐盛、市氣忍又步步下游、迨至下午開盤、人心更形不振、雖廠家之抛胃、尙未大票發動、惟麥收旣佳、北方之實銷、又未大暢、因天津平均現銷、不過二三萬包、較銷額最大時、約少三分之二、在新麥時期、自當以實銷爲主體、今之不振、頗合事實也、結果本月份無出入、七月份至十一月份各小一分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥市盤旋</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈盤旋之象、因洋麥報價旣微好、對中人心、示免轉定、且以新麥雖已登塲、但到源尙未大旺、故局勢雖有趨小之勢、多頭方面、依然硬擯、照此種狀態、如硬擯過甚、將來之標準、或者轉多實貨之抛售、彼時旗鼓相當、定有軒輊之分也、結果本月份較前週大二分、七月份不動、八月份大一分、九月份未動、十月份小二分、十一月份小一分、現麥市面、到源較湧、廠家因尙有洋麥、大致均有非廉不辦之態、開南京麥三兩八錢七分、和州麥三兩八錢二分、次至三二兩七錢三分、共八千四百○四包、由福新辦云云、</p>
<h3>福州帮挅辦客秈</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、行情雖未上漲、銷路略有活動因、本街停頓後、福州帮忽起試辦、前晚辦成江西機晚三百多包、價十一元零五分至十元、昨午又辦二百三十包、價十元零八九角、貨品均屬大市普通貨、高貨雖有囤戶購存、然檢價太小、不肯輕脫、洋米出入兩無、回範亦未成交、蓋因市况甚疲、進戶觀望、貨主因成本高昂、不忍貶價求脫云、</p>
<p>絲茶　江北春繭繅折奇大</p>
<p>洋種繭須六百餘斤……土種繭八百斤左右江北泰縣·泰興·如臯·淮陰等處、今鶪春蠶備受天時之損害、繭產奇歉、統扯不滿三分年歳、繭身因多雨奇寒之故、吐絲不足、蔳皮雙宮居多、新樣繭已試綶、烘挀須三百四五十斤、繅折最大爲土種繭、須八百斤左右、（乾繭）方可缫絲一百斤、洋種繭亦須六百二三十斤、</p>
<h3>黃絲經亦難轉暢</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無起色、歐美市塲、生絲廠銷仍清、白絲經電報昨均不轉、而黃絲經英印等莊亦因價昂、成交難暢、昨祇怡和等進黃廠經二十五包、美大等進黃粗絲四十包、價尙平定</p>
<h3>路莊珍眉歐銷不振</h3>
<p>昨日婺源屯溪等路之綠茶、各茶棧佈出新樣、不下二千餘箱、針眉貢熙等項、略有零星交易最關重要之珍眉綠茶、除抽芯貨英莊協和洋行</p>
<p>稍有購進外、其餘均持觀望態度、究其原因、實由於法國存茶尙豐、新貨並不急切需要、上週屯溪婺源珍眉開價過高、海外茶商闻風却步之故、惟是華商因各路收成較上年見减十分之五、態度仍趨穏定、是以普通珍眉全市並無開出云、</p>
<p>南北貨　湘蓮來源已斷</p>
<p>湘蓮近以產區存底已乏、市象異常堅定、現在行盤如頂上湘潭蓮售三十七八兩、以次爲三十五六兩、常德蓮三十三四兩、廣帮時有採購、惟數不多、聞業中人云、以地貨旣斷、後市必佳、故大部份已相約不肯賤卸、後市當有續漲之可能也、</p>
<p>五金　英鋼板有人收囤</p>
<p>英鋼板交易近頗進展、天津靑島烟臺諸帮連日均有點綴、故成交達六七百擔之多、但底貨不厚、囤戶鑒來源枯薄、兼之定價高昂、所以均有搜囤心思、查被購去達二三千擔、惟行情一節被其帶高不少、刻市二厘半售九兩半分七兩二錢半、七厘半七兩、一分六兩五錢、</p>
<p>糖市　粗砂白遂步趨漲</p>
<p>昨日糖市產區電訊、均無到來、公會市塲劃盤以外滙轉高、人氣略緊、荷糖二十四號粗砂白普通貨及香港貨成交價均十一兩六錢、出戶且屬不多、高貨喊十一兩七錢、尙少問津、二十號中砂白十兩○九錢半、交易亦寥、日糖市亦微升、但趨勢較平、Ｚ睞十一兩三錢二分半、ＴＫ　仝價、均係陳貨、新到者喊十一兩四錢、ＹＴ　十一兩三錢半、ＹＲＯ　十一兩、ＹＰ　十一兩七錢一分二厘半、ＡＥ　十一兩七錢、ＳＨ　十一兩一錢、ＴＭ　十一兩二錢二分半、市免尙俏、號盤禎祥號開出現貨香港粗砂白二千袋、價元十一兩六錢、裕發及漳泰二號開出本廠氷花靑各數百袋、價均十兩、原來貨開十兩○三錢、市均堅挺、抛貨荷赤、八九號貨捷成洋行頗爲遷就、價荷幣四元九角半、要手且甚寂寥云、</p>
<p>疋頭　扶摇直上之疋頭</p>
<p>本廠棉布　昨市益堅、細布大俏、藍鷄已達七兩五錢苯分半、陽鶴嘈叭章藍雙魚一致漲五分、細斜藍雙魚四川帮需要突　殷成交三百多件、故驟漲一錢、九磅粗布現貨仍抽缺、十一磅布亦硬、湖北天字呹風已息、昨售八兩八錢、金三塔漂布續漲須九兩四錢矣、粗余絞走銷仍寂、故無大變化、八四原布亦漲、藍飛魚六兩一錢半、路舞六兩一錢云、</p>
<p>東西疋頭　一致猛漲、尤以東貨最强、昨細　嘰漲二厘半、直貢緞上身貨已漸缺、中檔三友圖於三錢五分售罄、四學士開三錢六分半、第一功三錢七分半、條子府綢跌後復漲、什色已呈斷檔、秃白湖心亭楊貴纪均三錢八分、雪花　嘰自津帮採辦後、农漸俏俐、至昨現貨已呈絶跡、漂布亦漲一錢、鵲橋會十二兩五錢、定福君十一兩九錢、福壽三星十一兩二錢半、西貨大有難於搜羅之慨云、</p>
<p>煤炭　兩白煤突然飛漲</p>
<p>馬克與海豐</p>
<p>馬克白煤與少豐白煤兩種、昨市突然飛漲、每噸竟自十九兩五錢漲至念五兩有奇、查此種漲勢、爲從來所未有、且紅崎煤山西煤市價仍無變動、突其漲價之原因、蓋是項白煤、來自法屬安南、今法匯高漲、洋行定價昂貴、加之此間已月餘無到、而各棧存貨又將告罄之故云、</p>
<p>雜訊　日糖裝到二萬一千包、</p>

<h3>市政舉要</h3>
<p>— 南君</p>
<p>白敦庸著</p>
<p>在社會情形愈形複雜的現今、要使人民有秩序的生活着、政府即須對於大城市的市政加以特殊的注意、一個大城市、居民之衆、實有可觀、城市生活所重要的是一種新的習慣、即「嚴肅的紀律、系統的組織、積極的做事」是、應該先將這種新的習慣建設起來、然後市政的改進、纔易於推行、</p>
<p>古代日中爲市、先民以物易物、生活所需、取給於是而已、所以經濟活動的中心實爲成都成邑之漸、孟子說、「太王居岐、從之者如歸市、」此語實可玩味、周禮建國前朝後市、一爲政治中心、一爲經濟中心、二者爲構成都邑的要素、以古時的市詮、即今日所謂市政之市、此雖其演化之由來、然市政之重要　、由此可知、數千年來祇有市塲的管理而無都市的規劃、實爲不可掩飾的事實、以至近代、政府人民對於市政均有相當之注意、關於市政學專著、亦多發表、這「市政舉要」一書、民俗上著想、實爲特點、立論從吾國國情值得研究市政者之注意、</p>
<p>第一篇我國市制之沿革、第一章周代之市制、述我國市政肇端甚早、炎帝神農日中爲市、是爲我國市政的濫觴、逮至周初、漸趨興盛、這在周禮司市諸篇、言之綦詳、然考當時市之最大目的爲交易、所以其所設官分職亦側重於此、雖與今城市情形頗不相侔、但在當時規粗具的時候、如市政機關、警察、與社會事業等、皆有相當之組織、管理上並有明晰的系統、足爲今代之言市政者之參資、當時的市肆情形、極有可觀、作者試列以圖解、便於研究者之閲覽、</p>
<p>第二章唐代之市制、考我國三代以降、華夏文物之盛、首推於唐、唐之代、西逮歐洲、東被三島、所以我國中古時代的市制、亦以唐代爲準則、唐之市政、實可分爲京師與諸府州縣之别、作者有鑑於此、故分兩節以述之、（一）京師市政之組織、唐代市師的職掌、分隷於四官、甲、左右金吾衛猶漢之執金吾、清之九門提督、從前之京師警察廳、乙、左右街使、與警察署相類似、丙、京師市署令、爲專管市</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>政之官、類似從前的市政督辦、丁、長安萬年兩縣令、類似清季之大興宛平兩縣令、至其管理市政事務、各因其職權之不同、故範圍與性質亦異、其事務之要者、約分爲七項、一、關於公安者、二、關於社會事業者、三、關於衛生者、四、關於城市規畫者、五、關於工務者、六、關於公園者、七、關於財務、其名稱雖有不同、但其職司和現代之掌管亦有相仿之處、故此項考據工作、現代之研究市政實有明瞭之必要、（二）諸府州縣市政之組織、這是因唐時建都所設、雖非州縣之所、不得置市、但欲置市、已有二重限制、其一、須戶數在三千以上、其二、須爲州縣治所在地、若人口不在三戶以上、而欲置市、則必須具有特殊情形、乃能呈請中央設立、至其市政範圍、仍與府州同、與京師近似由此、我們可以明白唐代之市政、規模已堪稱大備、其優點表而彰之可分爲三、甲、組織有序、乙、行政權統一、丙、事業條例劃一、然我國的文化、言上古的、必稱三代、而三代以周爲鼎盛、言中古的、有唐實爲表率、其它朝代、市政雖不無可考、但受周唐的支配、則無疑義的了、這篇述上古中古的市制、只限周唐、而足从、供市政的背景、雖爲考據、亦藉作攻玉之一助、現在我國研究市制者、實不能忽此、</p>
<p>第三章民國之市制、此爲近代市政沿革的詳論、初述北平市制的變遷、次述廣州市制的變遷、自十七年七月國民政府公布特别市組織法後、廣州市旋亦遵照頒定條例、改爲特别市、其制詳於本書之末特别市組織法、再次爲國民政府公布之市制、自廣州設立而後、市政風氣爲之漸開、逮後國民政府成立、銳意整頓市政、市政之興、尤爲蓬勃、至今而兼力於市之地方自治、國民政府公布之市組織條例與廣州市暫行條例之比較觀、作者編一詳細之圖表、爲留情市制沿革的、闢一捷徑、</p>
<p>第二篇爲警察槪論、第一章警察之職權、我國警察之制、創自周代、以野廬治野、以司虣司、稽治市、所以維持秩序與安寗、其法至善、漢唐而降、迄於近世、古意寖失、言警務者、反取諸東西洋之法制、以爲準繩、文化落人之後、實爲所嘆、至民十九年五月、立法院通過市組織法、市政府下設四局、一、社會局、二、公安局、三、財政局、四、工務局、並規定市政府於必要時經過上級機闢的核准、得分别增設敎育局、衛生局、土地局、公用局、港務局、而公安局的執掌、經規定爲四大類、甲、公安事項、乙、消防事項、丙、公共衛生事項、丁、醫院菜市屠宰塲及公共娛樂塲所之設置及取締等事項、這不外「維持法律與秩序、」即爲警察之職權、亦即警察之天職、此旣明瞭、第二章警察之組織、作者更有詳論、警察組織、全國劃一、即現在所稱爲公安局、如交通隊、管理街衢交通、保安隊、輔助區所、以備指捙調遣、偵緝隊、偵緝盜賊姦匪、消防隊、消滅火災、這皆公安局之内部組織、於是可知一斑矣、第三章用人、語云、爲政在於得人、警政之難、尤貴得人、組織旣妥、若無</p>
<p>相當人才以充實之、則難有好樹立好成效、上自局長、下至巡邏、皆屬警察機體之一部、一部失當、牽動全體、所以警察用人、關係綦重、作者在此、分别論之、用人面方、如局長、警察、巡邏方面如脚踏車隊、汽車隊、服裝、給養、婦女警察、並將各國警制加以比較、實爲本書之長、</p>
<p>第三篇市政與市民之娛樂、由愛閙與人生觀、述于節期之改訂與慶祝、將中國之民情風俗、均有詳細的叙述、爲本篇之可貴處、篇末附錄十篇、尤足爲市政研究者的參考、</p>
<p>現政府對於市政、頗多注意、如古建築之利用與保存、各項警察之訓練、皆爲國人所注目、而繼興之市政日益加多、不可謂非十餘年來之進步、但關於吾國市政沿革、以至法令方案、極少見諸書版、今白君此著、實屬可貴、然今日之革新市政、第一要務在於造成市民、而要遂漸實行市民參政、因爲要看良好之市民、亦可造成良好的市政、此實爲當今革新市政的最要者、白君此書、雖未注意此點、但稽考古時市制、實爲特見、至於其它優點、恕不一一論列、</p>
<h3>歐美文學評論</h3>
<p>— 南君</p>
<p>廚川白村著　夏錄蕉譯</p>
<p>新文化的盛興、歐美文學却在世界新文壇上占了先趨、最近幾年來、日本文學放了一朶奇花異葩、很值得在文化落後的國家驕矜、但是他們的一般文學研究者、對於歐美文學依然不肯忽視、探求其價值的眞髓、日本新文化的突進、大有後來居上之勢、也是爲了這個不自滿的原因、</p>
<p>日本文壇健者廚川白村、在中國現代讀者的腦筋中想具有深刻的印象、他所著的具有世界價值的文藝論書、如「苦悶的象徵」「近代文學十講」「出了象牙之搭」等、幾成爲研究文學者必覽的書、像「近代文學十講」一書、對於歐洲文藝思潮上却有不少的貢獻、因爲這様的書、在歐洲文壇也不易多見、作者以這種研究史的眼光、來評判歐美文學、當然是非常精密的正確的、同時我們覺得讀普通的文藝評論、往往因爲這類專門的作品、内容乾燥乏味、不免要使我們滅少閲讀的旨趣、有的、也不過是一些呆板的講義式的材料而已、就如敎師板起面孔在課堂上嚴整地在講授死板板的書、學生在下面聽了祇是打瞌旽、毫無引起聽講者的奮興、廚川白村底文藝專著、却打破了這種呆板的講羲式的範疇、完全注意於趣味的叙述、這就是它底偉大處、</p>
<p>這「歐美文學評論」、他的方式也是如此、而且趣味更其盎然、使我們讀了、有似閲覽一篇精美的創作、但是它底特質、題材、却是屬於文藝理斌的、第一篇「左脚切斷」、起初我們讀了、所得的印象、以爲它一是篇美的記叙文、在本文的開始、他是這樣的寫着、『三月末日、我想往海的那方去旅行、想把家族移至東京、正忙着種種的準備的時候、偶然在左脚上受了點疏忽的創傷、就成爲原因、腫得了不得、開始痛起來了、發熱也很利害、連忍耐着、走都不能走了、自己的脚、旣像這樣已經是仇敵似的了、惡魔在那裏結着窩的呀、再進一步的决心、就把牠割掉牠罷、一面呻吟於床上、自己獨自一面這樣的想着、昔年大燈國師、因脚不完全、坐禪時坐不到好處、所以有個時候、喊出「這個鬼脚」、生硬的折斷它、它就這樣結療起來、到底死去了的、眞有痛快的和尙呀、我這樣感佩着、我自從在甚麽書上讀到了這個故事、就覺着有趣、到現令還記憶着的、只這一點兒傷、就受不住、有愧於大燈國師、我這樣的想了、……割掉一隻脚、支住兩根拐杖、能勉强走到東京罷』、下面雖然仍是這樣如故事一般的在叙述着、但是、漸趨文學原理的中心、如「病院生活、是到底不能成爲詩的、是一種殺風景的討厭的東西、特别以如我受的外科手術爲詩題的作品、」這、仍是含有濃厚的旨趣、但本篇題名「左脚切斷」、在最後、才把這悶葫蘆的藥告訴了我們、</p>
<p>「起初是四隻脚、中間是兩隻脚、最後成爲三隻了、脚數越少越强的東西是甚麽、」</p>
<p>『讀者所都知道的這是希臘的Sphinx謎呀、解不破這個謎的人、會失掉生命的、依很帕斯王漂亮地回答說是「人呀、」嬰兒的時候用四隻脚爬、老年的時候兩隻脚再添上一根拐杖成爲三隻、中年的時候僅兩隻、這是最强的呀、但像我這樣的一隻脚、却一點也沒有說、若是說脚數越少越强、一隻脚在普能人間以上要更强罷、這才是在Sphinx的謎都沒有的强者、人間若再一步進化的時候、脚一隻就够了、命名呌做超人、眞的從我這樣超人看來、兩隻脚的普通平凡的人間、看去是不好看的極不體面的弱者、』</p>
<p>這種文藝論述、可說是别闢蹊徑、很可作研究文學者創作文學理論的借鏡、實爲不可韓言的事實、</p>
<p>第二篇「文學者與政治家、」是一篇比較重要的論者、也可以說是文藝上的「人生批評、」所論很精澈、富有民族的思想、是說文學將與政治携手、指示研究文藝者一條進路、如在篇末所說、</p>
<p>眞爲建設有根祇的國民生活、在眞的文化主義人文主義上、爲政造民族生活、政治家與文學者雙方要互相接近、在雙方的中間、要生出更有意義的密接的關係的日期、我相信不久必要到來的罷、</p>
<p>當然、寫文學作品、如難開地面的氣球那樣、却不大可靠、同時、並不一定有必得將政治和社會上的問題、直接的在他的作品處理的必要、不過、就對於這些問題、具有隻眼、能批判能理解的預備以人生的批評家說、文學者是不可等閒視的、關於此、在本文裏作者也叙述得極形清楚、在嗜愛文學的靑年徘徊於歧路的時候、這種含有正確思想的論著、眞是黑夜的明燈、並且、作者對於歐美文學作一種嚴正的批判、給初學者許多有意義的常識文學上的、</p>
<p>第三篇「愛爾蘭文學的新星、」是將歐洲藝苑的一切優良的東西和事體、作一種具體的偉觀、把愛爾蘭劇的最優秀的新進作家、介紹於世、更爲珍貴、比如獨幕劇、在最近已經把夏芝與辛辜的名聲壓倒的丹賽尼卿的作品、因它底公演、在美國的藝苑、起始就被認識了他的眞價值、愛爾蘭劇在世界文壇上占了地位、這裏所述極爲詳細、是一篇偉大的現代劇論	、</p>
<p>第四篇「傑克倫敦的小說、」他是現今美國文壇以第一流作家知名、再在英文小說界占有特異的地位、但這位作家的小說、是很少人將它作系統的介紹、如寫人間故事的「野獸之聲」（Call　of　thewild）和「白牙」（Wbite　fang）等名作、作者在此均有精密的評述、並且、其筆法是以寫小說一樣、有如我們在讀傑克倫歐的小說、</p>
<p>基它如「遊戲論、」「美國的新劇團、」「文藝通信、」兩編、（一）英德的學風、（二）追憶伊之茄萊、（J,Echegary）「無言劇的復興、」「歐洲戰亂與海外文學、」「美國的大學」等論、均爲極有價值之作、文雖屬於評論一類、但我們以它爲文藝思潮和文藝原理一樣的看、也無有不可、在每一編中、又充滿着濃厚的趣味、極便初學者閲讀、這書問世之後、那種呆板的講義式的文藝論著是被打破了、僅這一點、也足以估量它所具的新價值了、</p>
<p>夏君的譯筆很流得、極合我國讀者的口味、</p>

<h3>中公劇社出演後</h3>
<p>— 杜書</p>
<p>中公劇社的第一次公演是已經成了過去了、</p>
<p>在事先、誰都意料着他們不會有好的結果、因爲他們雖已排演過好幾次、但對於劇本的背誦似乎還沒有十分的把握、而且演員中另外還發生過特别事故、更曾受到種種的打擊、同情和關心他們的人都爲他們擔着心事、但意外的、他們獲到最後的成功了、在觀衆擠滿了全劇塲的混亂情形下、能把秩序維持得很好、使大家都屏息靜氣的聽着他們的現身說法、我們可以想像得到他們是怎樣的成功了、</p>
<p>他們意外的成功、使得一般人爲他們快樂、更得到很多人的道賀、</p>
<p>我願意將他們的成績在此地紀錄下來、我更願意這紀錄會引起社會對於他們的注意、本來、學校戲劇運動現在還在萌芽的時代、在他們還未開放的一朶花蕾就會使得人這樣稱心滿决、我們是更覺得他們的成績是怎樣的值得我們去寳貴了、</p>
<p>他們演的劇本是「梅蘿香」、這劇本是戲劇家顧仲彝從英文改譯出來的、他們這次的導演、請的就是顧君、對於這劇本的大處小處、這導演是要比别人懂得和體會得更多的、那他們這次的成功又不是沒來由的了、</p>
<p>現在讓我們談到這劇本裏的事、</p>
<p>梅蘿香是一個年靑貌美的女戲子、她的意志很是薄弱、她的生活常常是選一條最容易的路走、她願意得到很多的金錢過着虚僞而奢侈的生活、另一方面她又願意得到一個眞心愛她的人而得到幸福、因爲這樣、她就造成了這一幕悲劇、這次他們的公演中、梅蘿香這一角是由他們的女社員張兆和女士扮演的、張女士是該校的高材生、活潑天眞、對於國語尤顯得純熟非常、但是術的個性是和梅蘿香不大合的、在事先一般人的批評也覺得不大適宜、因爲好像她的表情祇能在喜劇中擔任角色、悲劇的角色是不行的、而且她的態度好像也不大像、但是這些完全是一班人的過慮、在劇中她使人想像不到的成功、自始至終她一直很鎭定使全劇弄得很是緊張、表情的温柔和剛强、都用得十二分的巧妙、而且口齒清白、更使一般觀衆聽得入神、到了最後幾幕、她似乎更興奮得忘記了自己了、演得悲傷處所、她簡直引得幾個軟心的女性觀衆流下了清涙、使這次公演能成功、她實在是一個最大的功臣、此後她將也更受到許多年靑人的崇拜了、</p>
<p>第二個出塲的是白森卿、他是一個有錢的商人、他是海蘿香的戀人和她的金錢的供給者、這角色他們找到了一個最適當的演員歐陽信君來担任、歐陽君比較有舞台經騐、對於戲劇好像好比較接近、用他那偉梧的身材、洪大的聲音、使得這角色變得有聲有色、十二分的得體、他飾演劇中人的壞行爲、却得到觀衆的同情、他使人發笑、也使人興奮、更使人不由自的緊張而害怕、他的成績是不可多得的、</p>
<p>此刻要說到梅蘿香的愛人、那個年青的新聞記者馬子英了、這角色由年靑氣盛的張良意君担任、張君那一番理直氣壯的神氣、演來恰如其分、無疵點可以找尋、張君是四川人、說話不免四川口音、所以在事前很有人担心到一點、但是他一上台後就兩樣、他意外的使人滿意、他意外的得到成功了、</p>
<p>還有一個梅蘿香的女朋友、也是做戲而墮落的女人筱春蘭、她就是在中間勸梅蘿香重開愛情回到金錢那邊去的女人、她很風騷、是穿漂亮衣服、陪有錢人看戲吃飯的一個無聊女人、這角色在中公是很難得到的、因爲中公的女同學都很保守、但爲了使這戲演得成功、有女社員朱琴女士義不容辭的勇敢的担任了、她在劇中肆無忌憚的發揮她的藝術天才、她使這戲有了另外一種情景、自然、她也是成功的、</p>
<p>在中間還有樊振邦君扮演劇中的一個老戲子秦呌天、也是很難得的、他那老成持重、飽經世故的樣子、演來和劇中人的個性恰好相合、在前後兩幕中、一悲一喜、他更表演得判若兩人、我們知道他對於藝術是怎樣的有修養了、</p>
<p>這裏還有一位演得最好的是王華蓮女士、她在劇中飾梅蘿香的娘姨桂媽、她那副滑稽的扮像、是使每一個人都禁不住要失笑了、可是她、她像電影上的明星裴斯開登、不怕别人怎樣的笑落了門牙、笑痛了肚子、她還是一張鐵板面孔、顧自做着她自己的戲、一個對於戲劇沒有深刻的認識和修養的自然不能做到、所以她不期然而然的受到一般人的重視了、她的功勞還使這戲變得很有生氣、在悲劇的情緒中有了喜劇的氣息、</p>
<p>六個演員都談到了一點了、對於這說話的簡略我是覺得抱歉、好在他們都是很努力的、讓我在下一次來彌補這缺陷吧、</p>
<p>本星期六他們原來是要到南京去公演一次的、但是爲了别的緣故、和社員因爲學校放假而星散、他們祇有中止不去、現在他們是已下了决心的繼續的幹下去、大槪下學期開學了、我們又可以聽到他們第二次公演的消息了、</p>
<h3>别</h3>
<p>— 劍秋</p>
<p>奎、他是個誠實的靑年、而且學問又很好的、他十八歲的那年、是我高小的同學、就在那年畢業後、因了家况的窮苦、不能繼續的升學了、</p>
<p>在暑假的一天、正是太陽懷抱大地的時候、人們都是喘息在家裏、所以馬路上顯得很沉寂的、祇有二三個黃包車夫、赤着脚在火板似的馬路上奔路、雖然是汗如雨珠似的直胃下來、</p>
<p>我爲了要看奎、胃着酷熱的太陽、在行人道上急步、片刻之間、我就到了他的家裏、這時他正沉默的坐在桌前、回轉頭來、强掙着苦笑的臉說、</p>
<p>「呵、趙、你這熱的天都來麽」、</p>
<p>「我特意來看你的」、我就坐在他的桌旁的椅上、隨即我又問他、「你下學期預備考何學校呢」、</p>
<p>「呵」、他嘆息了口氣、頓時他的臉上現着難過的表情、久後、他將家况的情形告訴了我、他說、在他十三歲的時候、不幸他的父親死了、那時全家的生活、都靠着他母勤懇地爲人做些勞苦的事情、纔算把家庭維持到現在、在這五年之中、他母親因了他、受盡了一切的痛苦、所以身體變得十分的衰弱了、因此在下學期、他是不能有升低的希望了、</p>
<p>别後光陰是迅束地一天天的過去了、這學期我是考取了南京中學、然而奎我是時常的會想起來、一天、我孤獨的一人在室中蹁步、窗外的枯萎的荒草、迎風瑟瑟而悲秋、忽然腦海裏又回憶起奎來、呵、我是好久沒有見面了、誰知第二天的早晨、他的母親會和我在途中遇見、</p>
<p>「伯母、奎呢」、我問她、</p>
<p>「奎在上月已經到漢口去做生意了、他沒有信給你麽」、</p>
<p>我怔着、茫然地看着她、似乎有一塊沉重的石頭壓着了我的心頭、</p>
<p>「他有信給你麽」、經她第二次問我、的時候、我纔覺悟啊、</p>
<p>「他沒有信給我」、</p>
<p>「那末他的通信的地址我來告訴你吧」、當時我在衣袋裏掏出了日記簿和鉛筆、將奎的地址抄錄以後、就忽忽的告别了他的母親、</p>
<p>在街頭走了一趟、於是無精力的回來、在靠近窗口的椅子坐下、一時彷彿感覺受了一種莫大的刺激、我想起他在學校裏、對於文學方面、老師及同學們無不說他有天才、每學期的考試、各科無不超人之上、然而爲了經濟的艱難、而不能如他的志願去讀書、啊、他可造就的前途是被生活斷送了、</p>

<p>Publishes "A Letter to Allied Compatriots on Eradicating the Red Bandits"</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fifth Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee convened its third general meeting at 8:00 AM on the 15th, in the First Conference Hall of the Central Party Headquarters. Attending were Central Executive Committee members Ye Chucang, Wang Boling, Fang Juehui, Ding Weifen, Zhou Qigang, Yang Shuzhuang, He Chengjun, Yu Youren, Zhang Qun, Zhu Peide, Dai Chuanxian, Wang Boqun, Wang Zhengting, Chen Lifu, Chen Guofu, Kong Xiangxi, Zhu Jiahua, Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, Zeng Yangfu, Shao Yuanchong; Observers: Alternate Central Executive Committee members Liu Wendao, Zhang Daofan, Ke Xing'e, Cheng Tianfang, Yu Jingtang; Central Supervisory Committee members Wu Jingheng, Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei; Alternate Central Supervisory Committee member Chen Bulei; Chairman Yu Youren. The matters discussed were as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Passed a resolution to unite in eradicating the Red Bandits</p>
<p>A Letter to Compatriots Throughout the Nation</p>
<p>"The Red Bandits, with their cruel nature, have taken advantage of our society's many troubles to incite rebellion, which has lasted for several months. Murder and arson are rampant. Given the excellence of Chinese culture, the purity of our nation, the obviousness of the Prime Minister's legacy, and the Party's past achievements in restoring order, eradication should not be difficult. However, frequent military conflicts have allowed these fellows to gather and stir up trouble, and the impoverishment of the people has allowed them to incite rebellion. The government has not fully exerted its ability to suppress, and the people have not fully exerted their power of self-defense, so that a single spark threatens to ignite the prairie. In the provinces of Hubei and Jiangxi, the bandit flames are particularly fierce. Our Party takes the relief of the people's suffering as its responsibility. Every day we feel guilt and pain for the deaths and displacement of compatriots in bandit-affected areas. Now the government has decided to launch a large-scale expedition to areas where banditry has already taken hold, to eradicate them by a set deadline, and to actively implement rural clearing in areas where banditry has not yet taken hold, to prevent their spread. At the same time, the Party Headquarters will instruct Party branches at all levels to cooperate with local governments, jointly curb the budding rebellion, provide strategies, and strictly evaluate performance. In this way, by using the nation's strength to suppress the spreading bandits, we can establish a new defense and annihilate these ugly captives. However, the Red Bandit scourge is like a lung bacterium, deeply hidden and violently erupting. They use all kinds of cruel tricks to face our gentle compatriots in the villages. Some may seek temporary peace without realizing that their suffering will deepen. Therefore, in the spirit of united cooperation to eliminate evil completely, we explain it in detail to our compatriots.</p>
<p>First, we urge our compatriots not to harbor feelings of侥幸 [jiao xing; gambling/taking chances, a fluke]. Today, Chinese people all know the intensity of the Red Scourge, but the majority who live outside the bandit areas still stand idly by, thinking they will be spared. They do not know that behind the Red Bandits is the Red Imperialism, which directs them and aims to conquer our entire nation. Their method is to create an uncontrollable rabble. If we do not realize this now, the turmoil will spread, and everyone will suffer the same fate. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Second, we urge our compatriots not to harbor feelings of fear. The Red Bandits</p>

<p>have created unprecedented terror and adopted so-called guerrilla-style riots. Their aim is to shake people's hearts, intimidate the good, and make them afraid to resist. Then they can gradually carry out their slaughter. This cunning and viciousness must be clearly recognized. It must be known that only with a determined heart can there be hope for survival, and only with an indomitable spirit can there be no opportunity for exploitation. The strength of the Red Bandits is inherently insufficient. Their inhumane actions in the bandit areas are due to their cruelty and also to intimidate people with their initial actions. If we see through their tricks and show them our unwavering determination and fearless struggle, then we will have more people than them, we will be firm while they are fearful, and we will be solid while they are weak. Hitting an egg with a stone, we will surely annihilate them. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Third, we urge our compatriots not to harbor feelings of shirking responsibility. Today, the people know that the Red Bandits and we cannot coexist, but they ultimately believe that power is not in their hands and responsibility does not belong to them. The army is responsible for suppression and defense, and the government is responsible for pacification and investigation. It is as if the people have nothing to do with it. The government and the army have their responsibilities and cannot shirk them, but they also rely on the people to have the courage to save themselves and the determination to defend themselves, in order to achieve greater results. For example, if the army wants to search for remnants of bandits, but the villagers hide them and do not report them, or if the government is carrying out rural clearing, but the villages know there are bandits but dare not report them, then even if the suppression is strong, it will be difficult to eliminate the bandits. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Fourth, we urge our compatriots not to harbor feelings of passive observation. Adversity builds a nation, as the ancients taught. Seeking more blessings depends on human effort. Although the Red Bandits' power is spreading, they are cruel, inhumane, and devoid of reason. Those who have been coerced into joining the bandits are increasingly aware and thinking of reforming themselves. Those who have been trampled on are also determined to seek revenge and vow not to coexist with them. Their crimes are becoming more apparent, and their end is near. If our compatriots can muster the great power of national self-defense and rise up to eliminate them with one heart and one mind, and if every district, town, village, and hamlet does its best to guard and help each other, setting nets to watch and waiting in strict formation, so that the bandits have nowhere to hide and cannot rest as they flee, then a fundamental eradication can be expected soon. Otherwise, they will be shaken by their propaganda, confused by their momentum, hesitant to wait for change, and only sigh and lament. The hope for temporary peace may not be achieved in the end, and the situation of a rotten fish will form, which is exactly what the Red Bandits are seeking. This is the fourth point.</p>
<p>The four points mentioned above are not excessive demands from the Party to our compatriots. It is truly because the rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen. Since the Red Bandits are a great scourge to our nation, it is necessary to gather the united strength of the entire nation to eradicate them. Our Party upholds the Prime Minister's legacy and shoulders the heavy responsibility entrusted by the National Assembly. Quelling the rebellion and suppressing the bandits is our inescapable duty. Our compatriots must also have the heart to save and strengthen themselves, and do their best to defend the nation and protect the race. Either repair defenses and stabilize the villages, or fight with common hatred and assist in the suppression, or correct heresies and curb their spread, or investigate bandit tracks and prevent their concealment. With collective wisdom and effort, everyone must urgently eliminate this evil scourge. How could it be that with the cooperation of 400 million people, we cannot eradicate this gang of impoverished bandits who are a source of national disaster? Therefore, in addition to warning Party members and supervising the government, we sincerely urge our compatriots. We hope that our compatriots throughout the country will be aware of this."</p>

Chairman Ye Chucang presided. After the ceremony, Wu Jingheng delivered the closing address, stating that the closing declaration of today's Fifth Plenary Session has been printed and will be issued immediately. He then reported on the important responsibilities of this meeting: (1) After the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution, Party members have greater responsibilities and should immediately hold the Fourth National Congress. It has been scheduled for National Day. (2) The revision of the organizational law of the highest organ. The organizational law of the National Government has been revised and improved. (3) The Red Bandit disaster has grown from small to large and must be eliminated with all efforts to save the people. A resolution has been passed and will be implemented immediately. (4) At a time when the government is fully engaged in suppressing the bandits, there are sudden disturbances to the peace. The Central Committee has always been generous and adheres to the principle of peace. Unless absolutely necessary, it will never use force. It is deeply believed that the government will be able to eliminate the Red Bandits in a short period, allowing the people to recuperate and engage in construction. Reactionary elements will definitely not be able to create further complications. Comrades with historical knowledge will be able to learn from Sima Guang's history. Therefore, the current situation will definitely not create problems. We only need to work hard to suppress the bandits. After the Fourth National Congress, construction will gradually progress, and the Party and the nation will become increasingly prosperous. This is everyone's hope. Then, music was played, photographs were taken, and the meeting adjourned. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<h3>The Attitudes of the U.S. and France Towards the German Question</h3>
<p>The most important issue in the international community is the war debt and reparations problem. The world is paying attention to the attitudes of the U.S. and French governments, as the lack of resolution of this issue prevents the clearing of international opinions. The most affected parties are Germany, the U.S., and France. Today, the German Center Party issued a notice hoping for a swift resolution to the reparations problem, stating that resolving this issue is the way to avoid revolutionary suffering in Germany and throughout Europe. It is also hoped that all rational people in the world will take precautions to avoid future regrets. The urgency and alarm in their words are evident.</p>
<p>Regarding the attitudes of the U.S. and France, although there has been no formal expression, judging from the declarations of U.S. Undersecretary of State Carr and French Foreign Minister Briand, there is hope that the problem can be resolved. Carr stated that the U.S. government does not insist on a complete separation of reparations and war debts and will consider whether to temporarily change its policy if necessary. German newspapers have emphasized his declaration, stating that it is sufficient to increase the political significance of the U.S. to Germany. Briand said that his efforts to maintain peace are due to France being suspected of disrupting peace, which he must overcome all difficulties to prevent. He also said that the misunderstandings between Germany and France in recent years can be eliminated in the near future. Although the reparations problem was not explicitly mentioned, it is easy to see between the lines that the reparations problem is approachable. Therefore, I believe that these messages are worthy of the world's attention.</p>
<h3>Foreign Dispatches</h3>
<p>Germany's Center Party Continues to Trust the Government</p>
<p>Reparations Create an Economic Crisis</p>
<p>Hoping the World Will Rise Up to Salvage the Situation</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (National News Agency) – The German Center Party's Executive Committee and its parliamentary group held a closed-door meeting today. Those hoping to hear a speech from Brüning were disappointed. However, after the meeting, the party issued a statement expressing its continued trust in the government and hoped for a swift resolution to the reparations issue. It stated that resolving this issue is essential to prevent revolution and suffering in Germany and throughout Europe. It further hoped that people of reason worldwide would take preventative measures to avoid the regret of being unable to salvage the situation.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (National News Agency) – U.S. Undersecretary of State Castle recently declared that the U.S. government does not insist on a complete separation between reparations and war debts, and that the U.S. government is willing to reconsider whether its policies should be changed if necessary. This declaration is highly valued in political and opinion circles here because it has increased the political significance of the upcoming visit to Germany by U.S. Secretary of State Stimson and Treasury Secretary Mellon. The value of this declaration for Germany will soon be discovered, but it does not imply that the United States is prepared to allow the suspension of war debt payments.</p>
<p>Briand Reaffirms Maintaining Peace</p>
<p>Misunderstandings with Germany Can Be Easily Resolved</p>
<p>Paris, 14th (National News Agency) – Today, Foreign Minister Briand spoke at a banquet for veterans of the European War, saying that he intends to continue shouldering the heavy responsibility of diplomacy for the sake of world peace. Therefore, the honor bestowed upon him by the veterans is an endorsement of his peace policy. He is striving to maintain peace because France is suspected of disrupting it, so he must overcome all difficulties to dispel the world's doubts. He then spoke of Franco-German relations, saying that misunderstandings between the two countries in recent years can be resolved in the near future.</p>
<p>French Excursion Ship Capsizes</p>
<p>Encountering Storm on Return Trip from Picnic</p>
<p>Over Four Hundred Drowned</p>
<p>Saint-Nazaire, 14th (National News Agency) – The French excursion ship Saint-Philibert, carrying 600 passengers, departed from Nantes this morning for a picnic on the island of Noirmoutier. This afternoon, while returning from the island, five miles offshore from here, a large storm arose. Passengers, witnessing a giant wave approaching, panicked and rushed to one side of the ship. The ship's weight suddenly became unbalanced, and it immediately capsized when the second wave struck. Only eight people on board survived. Fortunately, seeing the bad weather, half of the 600 excursionists stayed on the island, avoiding the shared fate. However, the number of deaths is between 250 and 300, many of whom are women and children. Tonight, thousands of relatives of the deceased are mourning at the piers in Nantes and here, a scene of utter desolation.</p>
<p>Paris, 15th (National News Agency) – It is now believed that 442 people perished in the waves after the Saint-Philibert ship accident. According to the latest information, there were 461 tourists in total, with only eight rescued. Another 17 people avoided disaster because they suffered from seasickness and stayed on the island. So far, four female corpses have been recovered.</p>
<p>Arctic Exploration Submarine Unable to Withstand Wind and Waves</p>
<p>Machinery Experiences Problems</p>
<p>U.S. Warships Rush to Rescue</p>
<p>New York, 14th (Reuters) – The large submarine Nautilus, which departed from Groton, Massachusetts, on June 5th, bound for London, experienced machinery damage in the Atlantic Ocean and could not proceed. The U.S. merchant ship Independence Hall is monitoring the situation, and the U.S. warships Arkansas and Wyoming are also rushing to assist. Once the waves calm down, they plan to tow the submarine to the nearest port. The famous Arctic explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins is currently on board the submarine. He plans to use this submarine to navigate underwater from Spitsbergen directly to the North Pole. When the submarine left Groton, it carried enough food for a year and a half and enough fuel for 4,000 to 5,000 miles of navigation. According to a report from the U.S. ship President Roosevelt, the Nautilus submarine's starboard motor is damaged, but the port motor is intact, so it can still move under its own power.</p>

<p>Calendar Reform May Be Difficult to Achieve</p>
<p>Many Opponents Exist</p>
<p>Geneva, 14th (National News Agency) – The League of Nations Expert Committee previously sent questionnaires to various national governments, public organizations, and celebrities regarding the reform of the current calendar. About 8,000 responses have now been received, but the future of calendar reform is still very bleak. People in the Catholic and Anglican churches are particularly nostalgic for the old calendar.</p>
<h3>Telegram</h3>
<p>Nanchang Telegram – To all newspaper offices: It has recently been reported that the Shanghai Da Mei Evening News and the Japanese-run Japanese Daily News published news stating that He Yingqin was assassinated by bandits in Gan on the 8th of this month. Upon investigation, the Red bandits in southern Jiangxi took advantage of the Guangdong Incident in the middle of last month, hoping to break through the defense line south of the Wujiang River in Yongfeng and plunder. They were met with a head-on attack by our army and suffered heavy losses, and have already retreated to their old nest in Ningdu. The area within hundreds of miles of Gan is very peaceful. The assassination is completely unfounded. Such fabrications of facts and swaying public opinion are clearly being exploited by reactionaries to promote the Red bandits. I am specially telegraphing your newspaper to publicize this accurate information to the public, so that they may understand that the intentional rumors of the reactionaries are worthless. He Yingqin.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia's Economic Plan for China</h3>
<p>Planning to Establish Large-Scale Sino-Russian Bank</p>
<p>Operating Import and Export and Banking Business</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence – In recent years, Soviet Russia's policy toward China has been determined to carry out large-scale economic aggression. Last year, with Borli as its base, it organized an Economic Committee to develop trade with China, dumping the successful products of its Five-Year Economic Plan, which achieved significant results. This year, with the implementation of the state-run collectivized agriculture policy, the economic foundation has become even more solid. Its overall economic plan for China has been scheduled to be discussed at a meeting to be convened in Moscow on June 15th. All consuls-general stationed in Liaoning, such as Znamenski, and consuls-general stationed in Heilongjiang, such as Bobov, have returned home to participate in the meeting. Kuznetsky, the acting deputy director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, is also scheduled to return home within days to attend the meeting. It is faintly heard that the main agenda items of the meeting are about a dozen, roughly divided into economic development plans along the Chinese Eastern Railway, economic development plans in South Manchuria, and economic development plans along the Heilongjiang and Songhua River. After the meeting decides on each plan, it will order the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Russian consulates in the Eastern Provinces to jointly implement them step by step. However, before the implementation of this plan, Russia intends to first establish a bank in Northeast China, which will be larger in scale than the current Far Eastern Bank. The Far Eastern Bank's fund is 5 million rubles. The bank originally established branches in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Manzhouli, Liaoning, Tianjin, and Beiping, but since 1929, they were successively closed due to political or diplomatic reasons. Although various branches have tried their best to recover in recent years, they have either been disallowed by our authorities or, even if recovered, not trusted by the general public. Therefore, currently only the head office in Harbin is operating. Moreover, its reliance is only on the Chinese Eastern Railway's treasury. This year, the Chinese Eastern Railway's business is declining, and the bank is also affected. Therefore, at present, the bank is insufficient to be of use, whether due to political relations or financial strength. The Russian government is well aware of this situation, and therefore, at the beginning of the realization of its entire economic aggression plan against China, it intends to first establish a Sino-Russian bank as a treasury. In addition to having several times the capital of the Far Eastern Bank, its business purpose is to provide general banking services for deposits and loans, and also to engage in import and export business. Its nature is almost similar to Citibank in the United States, Korean Bank in Japan, Banque de l'Indochine in France, and HSBC in England. Although its starting point is the same as that of the Far Eastern Bank, its purpose is different. As for where the head office will be located, it will most likely be in Harbin or Liaoning. The branches will probably be in major ports in the Northeast and in Pingjin and Shanghai and Wuhan. The person in charge of this heavy responsibility is the newly appointed Russian Ambassador to Japan, Melinikov. Melinikov is the current Russian Consul in Harbin. He returned to Russia last month and has just returned. He was ordered by his government to investigate everything in detail and plans to go to Japan only after the investigation is completed. It is rumored that after the establishment of this bank, it will inherit the Chinese Eastern Railway's rights and interests of Daosheng Bank. The Chinese government should pay close attention to the truth of this statement (10th).</p>
<h3>The Issue of Revising Loan Contracts in Sino-Japanese Railway Negotiations</h3>
<p>Gao Jiyi Plans to Resign from the Key Negotiating Post</p>
<p>Extreme Disputes in Various Railway Loan Contracts</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence – Since the Japanese government specially appointed Kimura, who has diplomatic experience, as the director of the negotiation section of the South Manchuria Railway Co., Ltd. to resolve the outstanding issues of railways in the Northeast, Kimura has come to Shenyang several times. At first, he engaged in ordinary socializing to connect with various parties' feelings. Then, he put forward a proposal, saying that the two sides would only conduct ordinary talks and not in a formal negotiating manner. Finally, he personally went to inspect the lines of various loan-supplying railways to prepare for a response. His step-by-step approach was intended to establish himself in an absolutely advantageous position. However, looking at our side, the so-called specialized committee is only presided over by Yin Shousong. Although the other railway bureau directors nominally come to Shenyang once a week to perform their duties as specialized committee members, they are mostly exhausted by meaningless socializing and have long abandoned the negotiations. Gao Jiyi, the chairman of the Northeast Communications Committee, who is in charge of the most important matters, is running between Beijing and Peiping with Zhang Xueliang and has no time for this. Recently, there has even been talk of him feigning illness to avoid his post, and that Guo Jirun, the director of the Jichang Railway Bureau, will act on his behalf. Gao is usually very alert and knows that there will be no good outcome to this negotiation, so he is preparing to shirk responsibility. Guo, on the other hand, pursues empty fame and lacks practical ability, so it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve good results. Judging from the pre-negotiation situation of both parties, this negotiation is really not optimistic.</p>
<p>The Japanese side has put forward negotiating conditions, which include: 1. the issue of parallel lines, 2. the issue of freight competition, 3. the issue of revising loan contracts, and 4. the issue of completing the Jihui Line. In light of legal principles and facts, the first, second, and fourth items are not too difficult to deal with, as long as they are handled properly. The most difficult one, and all of which are factual issues, is the third item: the issue of revising loan contracts. The situation is described as follows: (1) The Sipingtaonan Railway: The railway's loan reached more than 50 million yuan, which is so large because no formal contract was signed, and it was only in the form of short-term loans. The annual interest rate was 9%. Every year, it was unable to pay the interest, so the contract was revised once, adding the interest to the principal and charging interest together. In addition, the government charged withdrawal management fees and rebates, so the actual amount used by the railway itself was only more than 20 million yuan. Of the remaining more than 30 million yuan, two-thirds were interest and one-third were management rebates and government withdrawals. Last year, when Zhou Peibing was the director, he discussed reducing the interest with the South Manchuria Railway. The South Manchuria Railway agreed to reduce it to 5%, but put forward the conditions: 1. a formal contract must be revised, 2. before the revision, the reduced interest would not be formal, but would be deducted from the joint transportation fee, 3. it would be responsible for introducing joint transportation between the South Manchuria Railway and other railways. After Zhou's consideration, although these were exchange conditions, they were all beneficial to our side and considered them acceptable. He immediately reported to the Northeast Communications Committee for a decision. However, the Communications Committee believed that reducing the interest was one thing, and revising the contract and joint transportation were another, and the two should not be confused. Moreover, since the South Manchuria Railway sincerely reduced the interest, it should not raise exchange conditions again. The joint transportation should also be initiated by our side and should not be proposed by the Japanese side. The bureau director was ordered to negotiate with the Japanese side according to this intention. Zhou was very angry, believing that the Japanese side had made this concession entirely due to his painstaking negotiations, but the meeting did not understand this. Feeling disheartened, he stopped talking about reducing the interest. Soon, Zhou resigned, and the case was shelved. Last year, the Communications Committee ordered each railway to submit opinions on revising the loan contracts in order to reorganize the various railway foreign debts. The railway stated the reduction of interest and the revision of the formal contract. This railway has fewer disputes among the railways borrowing in the Northeast, and the negotiation does not seem very difficult. (2) The Jidun Railway: This railway was contracted and built with funds advanced by the South Manchuria Railway. At first, it was 18 million yuan, but it was increased by 6 million yuan to 24 million yuan to repay Zhang Zuolin and improve the project. When it was completed last year, Zhao Zhen was the director, and he organized a completion evaluation committee, with the heads of the bureau's engineering and material departments and the Japanese chief engineer as members of the committee. He also appointed Zhong Jikong, the chief of the inspection section, as the chairman of the committee to preside over the matter. Zhong was a person with no common sense. After inspecting the line for a week, he sent a letter to the South Manchuria Railway in the name of the chairman of the completion evaluation committee to complete the work. Zhao resigned, and Li Duanpi took over as the director. At that time, it happened that the former director Wei Wuying was being investigated for various embezzlements and poor engineering, so he applied to the Communications Committee to hire engineering personnel from various railways to form another completion committee, and did not recognize the previous letter from Zhong Jikong, the completion evaluation committee, as valid. The committee was organized for several months and surveyed the line several times, preparing a report of thousands of words, pointing out three places where the project should be repaired extensively, more than seventy places where it should be repaired slightly, and more than one hundred and thirty places that did not conform to the original plan, and said that the highest price of the entire project was only more than 13 million yuan, and the remaining more than 10 million yuan was actually inflated, which our side could not recognize. Please verify. The committee sent the original to the railway bureau and ordered it to negotiate with the South Manchuria Railway quickly. However, the South Manchuria Railway refused to recognize it and handed over Zhong Jikong's original letter of completion, considering it as proof that our side had already completed the work. According to the contract, the South Manchuria Railway should accrue interest from the date of completion. Our side refused to accrue interest on the grounds that the work had not yet been completed, while the South Manchuria Railway calculated interest from the date of receiving Zhong's letter. Both sides had their own reasons and refused to give in to each other. The most difficult thing is how to deal with Zhong's letter. Zhong had already resigned with Zhao Zhen. It is now heard that there is a proposal to arrest him. It is not known whether it can be done or not. (3) The Taonai Railway: This railway is of the same nature as the Jidun Railway. The advance payment is still small, but there are other disputes. However, there is an item of expenses that the South Manchuria Railway has listed as high as more than 2 million yuan. After repeated negotiations by the railway bureau, it initially agreed to reduce it by tens of thousands of yuan, but then refused to concede any further. The railway had no choice but to submit it to the Communications Committee to request the committee to negotiate. However, the committee still ordered the bureau to handle it. The South Manchuria Railway will never concede this matter. The bureau has negotiated more than a dozen times, but it is still difficult to comply. The most fatal injury to this railway is the loan contract for residual materials and coal prices. Coal is the most important thing used by the railway. The railway has always purchased it from the South Manchuria Railway, and the price is very high. When the payment is due, a short-term loan contract is signed, with an annual interest rate of 9%. If the interest cannot be repaid on time, the interest is added to the principal and interest is charged together. The South Manchuria Railway sells coal to the railway at a price that is as high as more than 20 Japanese yen per ton. If the compound interest is multiplied, the price of each ton of coal will be about 100 yuan according to the current gold price. Someone said that coal alone is enough to ruin the Taonan Railway. According to a person from the Communications Committee, the committee could not cope with the railway's request to approve the inclusion of interest into the original principal each time, because if it approved the request, the loss would be too great and the matter too important. If the request was not approved, the railway would not be able to pay. It is now heard that it is planned to purchase more domestic coal to save it a little. (4) The Jichang Railway: The terms of the loan contract for this railway are the harshest among the loan contracts for state-owned railways. The South Manchuria Railway sends a representative to the bureau to direct the operation and business affairs, and his power is several times higher than that of the director. Previously, when Quan Liang and Wei Wuying were the directors, they were still able to rely on their qualifications or precision to manage things in many ways, and they still knew how to negotiate and handle things when things happened. Now, the South Manchuria Railway representative acts arbitrarily. If he is questioned even slightly, he uses the loan contract as a talisman, often citing the different interpretations of the text of the contract, resulting in repeated disputes that cannot be resolved. The loan contract for Jidun stipulates that when the formal contract is revised upon completion, it may be merged with Jichang. On the Japanese side, it is planned to use the original Jichang contract as the blueprint, while our side had previously planned to follow the Tianjin-Pukou contract. Now that things have changed, a separate plan will of course be proposed. However, since the Japanese side has obtained rights, it will never easily give in. This is another factual difficulty.

<h3>Censorate Raises Questions on the Zhuang and Shi Cases</h3>
<p>The Censorate's impeachment of Zhuang Zhihuan, Director of the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and Shi Shangkuan, a member of the Legislative Yuan, has been reported in detail in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the censors Tian Jiongjin and Liu Eqing, who originally impeached Zhuang Zhihuan, and the censors Gao Youtang and Shao Hongji, who originally impeached Shi Shangkuan, have filed another question case because the government has not dismissed Zhuang Zhihuan and Shi Shangkuan and sent them to the Legislative Yuan for punishment for two months. They questioned the government on what grounds it did not legally punish the impeached persons. Is the censorate system almost a sham? What is the value of having this Censorate? The wording is extremely serious, and it is not known how the government will respond.</p>

<h3>Freight Train Derailed on the Canton-Hankow Railway</h3>
<p>Over Twenty Lengths of Track Destroyed, Two Trains Overturned</p>
<p>One Laborer Injured, Over Ten Pigs and Cattle Killed</p>
<p>The railway tracks along the Guangzhou to Shaozhou section of the Canton-Hankow Railway have been in disrepair for some time, resulting in frequent train derailments. On the 6th of this month, at 6:00 AM, the 22nd freight train from Shaozhou to Guangzhou, consisting of five cars, experienced such an incident. The first two cars were carrying livestock such as pigs and cattle, the third and fourth carried firewood, and the fifth carried rice and stone. After unloading goods along the way, the train reached Xiaoping Station at 3:10 PM. At this point, the railway track suddenly gave way under the excessive weight, and over twenty lengths of track, including the rail and sleepers at the 280th marker, were destroyed. The driver was unable to brake in time, and as a result, the first two cars derailed and overturned into the fields. Fortunately, the third and fourth cars stopped quickly, averting a more serious accident. Personnel from that railway section hurriedly reported to the Guangshao Railway Bureau, stating that the 21st freight train had derailed between the 282nd and 282nd marker, and only came to a stop at the 273rd marker (i.e., Tangxikou). Two covered cars were found overturned on the roadside, and the remaining three covered cars and one guard car had also derailed, but had not overturned. There were no other issues. The cars were towed back to Huangsha. Twenty-five steel rails were found detached from the sleepers, and the bolts of the fishplates were broken. Upon receiving the report, the Railway Bureau immediately dispatched over a hundred workers with steel rails and sleepers to carry out repairs. Upon arrival, they used cranes to hoist the overturned cars one by one. The repairs to the railway track were completed by the morning of the 7th. In this accident, only one laborer in the first two cars was slightly injured. In addition, two or three oxen and eight or nine pigs were killed. Over twenty lengths of track were damaged. Therefore, the passenger train that departed from Yingde at 7:15 AM on the 7th was unable to pass through when it arrived at Xiaoping at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Passengers had to disembark and walk across the damaged track at Dalang Station before boarding a connecting train at Xicun to return to the provincial capital. On the afternoon of the 7th, over six hundred passengers heading to the North River arrived at the Huangsha Main Station to wait for the train north. However, they waited until 2:30 PM, but no southbound passenger train arrived. Later, a telephone report from Xiaoping stated that the passenger train would not be able to reach the provincial capital that afternoon. The passengers at the station were disappointed and returned. According to the Railway Bureau, the damaged track was not fully repaired until 3:00 or 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 7th. Therefore, all trains were able to resume normal service between Shaozhou and Guangzhou on the morning of the 8th. (June 8th)</p>
<h3>Itinerary of the Sino-French Expedition</h3>
<p>Passed Suiyuan Wuni Usu</p>
<p>After departing from Beiping, the Sino-French Expedition reached Wuni Usu in Suiyuan on May 26th, after leaving Bailingmiao on May 24th. The distance between these places is 269 kilometers, approximately 1,000 kilometers from Beiping. Along the way, many yellow sheep were seen. The team hunted three, sufficient to provide meat for a week. The journey passed through areas devoid of trees, and even the grass was not very lush due to the late season. In the three days of travel, only a few Mongolian families and about a dozen Han Chinese merchants doing business in the Mongolian grasslands were seen, all enduring extreme hardship. The only means of transportation was camel caravans, traveling at most forty or fifty li per day, with mules and camels needing regular rest and grazing. There were many quicksands, sinking to ankle depth, and numerous small stones. The daily climate variations were quite large, embodying the saying "wear fur coats in the morning and gauze in the afternoon." Local security, maintained by Mongolian guerrilla forces, was relatively peaceful. On May 27th, the expedition proceeded to Sande Temple, approximately one hundred kilometers away, a journey that could be completed in a day. When the vehicles stopped, those responsible for collecting plants and animals and conducting geological surveys were extremely busy.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Public Bond Lottery Redemption</h3>
<p>Highway Bonds and Disaster Relief Bonds</p>
<p>Hangzhou News: The sixth lottery redemption of Zhejiang Province Highway Bonds and the second lottery redemption of Disaster Relief Bonds were held this afternoon (the 15th) in the auditorium of the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce. Representatives from various agencies and organizations were sent to supervise the process. Xu Mao, a secretary from the Department of Finance, and Tang Shijian, the head of the Fourth Section, led officials to execute the process according to the law. Xu Mao, as chairman, performed the formalities. The chairman reported that the total issue of Highway Bonds was 2.5 million yuan, and that five previous redemptions had already taken place. This redemption was for 125,000 yuan, with interest paid at 100,375 yuan. The number of tickets to be drawn was divided into five groups, with one ticket drawn from each group. The source of funds was the surtax levied on land taxes, which was collected by the fund management committee for these bonds. He then invited a representative from the committee to report. Committee member Wang Ziqiu reported that monthly income totaled 191,301 yuan, leaving a shortfall of over 37,000 yuan. It would certainly be fully collected by the end of the month. The observers, Wu Jinqing and Xie Hucheng, were then invited to draw the lottery tickets by group, drawing the numbers 09, 26, 44, 77, and 82 from the five groups. Next, one ticket was drawn from each of the four groups of Disaster Relief Bonds. The chairman reported that the total bond amount was one million yuan, and this was the second redemption, for 40,000 yuan, with interest paid at 38,400 yuan. The funds for this were designated from taxes on brokers’ licenses, to be allocated monthly by the Department of Finance as needed. The observers Wu and Xie then drew the lottery tickets from each group, drawing the numbers 09, 29, 53, and 79. The chairman reported that the redemption and interest payments for both bonds drawn today would begin on July 1st, handled by the Zhejiang Local Bank and the governments of each county.

<h3>Jiangsu Province's Spring Silkworm Egg Production Industry This Year</h3>
<p>Estimated Production of 2,294,000 Sheets</p>
<p>In recent years, Jiangsu Province has seen rapid progress in both public and private efforts to improve the silkworm egg industry. According to surveys, there are now over 140 improved egg production farms. In previous years, improved eggs were rare, and most farmers relied on local Yu Hang breeds. One dan of dried cocoons required over three dan of fresh cocoons to produce when using local breeds, while improved cocoons required only two dan of fresh cocoons to produce one dan of dried cocoons. Therefore, improved cocoons are worth ten to twenty yuan more per dan than local cocoons. In the event of adverse weather, local breeds are almost completely wiped out, while improved breeds are more resistant to the weather and less likely to fail. Farmers in rural areas, especially in northern Jiangsu, were initially skeptical of improved breeds. After years of comparison, they have all come to trust caged breeds (local people call improved breeds "caged breeds"). One catty of local cocoons used to yield only one tael of silk, while improved cocoons can yield one tael and eight mace of silk. In the future, local breeds will inevitably lose their market. However, our country's only major rival is Japan. Every year, in addition to competing with our country in the European and American markets with their increasingly refined silk, Japan also imports large quantities of inferior breeds into our country. According to investigations, the first batch of spring eggs imported this year amounted to 300,000 sheets. Jiangsu Province's annual sales volume is only about ten million. If no measures are taken to resist this, not only will our country's egg production industry have no business guarantee, but it is also hateful that they import inferior silkworm eggs into our country, preventing thorough improvement in our country. According to statistics from the Provincial Silkworm Industry Supervision Office, the total amount of spring and autumn silkworm eggs produced by public and private egg production farms in Jiangsu this spring is approximately 2,294.4 taels. At 1,000 sheets of silkworm eggs per tael, this means that over 2,294,000 sheets of silkworm eggs can be produced. Even if Japanese eggs are completely blocked, demand will still outstrip supply.</p>

<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Robbery by Bandits in Shenjiazhai and Shashang Village: Shenjiazhai and Shashang Village, under the jurisdiction of the urban district outside Fengmen Gate, are located approximately twelve miles from the city. They consist of over one hundred households, whose residents are primarily engaged in agriculture and are generally quite prosperous. On the morning of the 14th, around 2:00 AM, four bandit boats suddenly arrived from the direction of Dushu Lake, entering Donggang and reaching Shenjiazhai. The boats carried over thirty bandits, dressed in various dark grey short jackets and wearing black casual hats. They were armed with flashlights, quick-firing guns, and box cannons, dividing into two groups. From two of the bandit boats, more than ten bandits landed in Shenjiazhai and first broke down the door of Shen Zhengxiang's house at number thirty-seven, looting it. They then proceeded to ransack house after house: Xu Shuigen, Xu Hongxiang, Xu Yuanxiang, Shen Fei's, Shen Hongxiang, Gu Xiangfu, Shen Suixing, Shen Faming, Shen Huiquan, and Qiu Shengfu. Simultaneously, the other two bandit boats sailed across the river and through the Shashang Bridge eastward to Shashang Village, robbing Xu Dexiang, Gu Genjin, Xu Caigao, Zhu Jinmao, Gu Xufa, Gu Zhixiang, Zhang Shengfa, Zhang Shengfu, Zhang Shengrong, Zhu Yeguang, Gu Yuxiang, Zhu Xiangfa, Gu Qixiang, Zhu Wan's, He Xiaogou, and Zhou Zhaoquan, totaling sixteen households. Afterwards, the group that robbed Shenjiazhai took their loot onto their boats and sailed along the river to Shashang Village to meet with the two bandit boats that had robbed Shashang Village. They fired shots into the air as a warning and proceeded eastward towards Huangshi Bridge in Lü'anqiao, turning south towards Huangtiandang and passing through Jinji Lake towards Chefang. Before leaving, they announced that they would rob Chefang again. The losses in both villages were estimated at over three thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Local Court Investigates Li Zhun's Bribery Case: The Wu County Local Court, ordered to investigate the case of bribery involving opium by Li Leng, former magistrate of Jiangyin, and Yang Ying, former trial officer, held a hearing yesterday (the 15th) at 2:00 PM, with prosecutor Lü Wenqin presiding. Those present included Li Leng, Wu Qian (former Inspector General of the Public Security Bureau), Qian Zhupeng and his son Gong Yinqing, the plaintiff Huang Bingying, the interested party Wang Sengru, and the detained Wu Shanshi, Lu Longbao, and Qian Abao. According to reports, Qian Zhupeng and Wu Qian denied seizing opium paraphernalia due to the lack of case files. Li Leng testified that matters concerning the bail of Yang Bingwei and Wu Shanbao were handled by the former Public Security Bureau Chief, Li Zonggang, and that only thirty packages of opium were transferred to the county, not ninety-two. Wang Sengru and others claimed that the seizure of opium paraphernalia at Qian Zhupeng's place was based on public rumors. After the interrogation, Li Leng and Qian Zhupeng were released on bail, while the others were dismissed.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Superintendent Dismissed and Investigated: Qin Jieren, Director of the Kunshan County Public Security Bureau, learned the other day that Superintendent Wu Songying was inspecting travelers at the Dadong Hotel. In room thirteen, he found a local man, Ni Songlin, cohabiting with a tailor's wife, Qian. Deeming their behavior inappropriate, Wu Songying took them to the bureau for questioning but privately released them mid-journey after receiving a bribe of twenty yuan. Director Qin dispatched Inspector Zhang Tian to investigate, and the report was confirmed. On the 15th, the superintendent was first dismissed and then sent to the county for further investigation.</p>
<p>Detective Team Captures Kidnappers: Wu Yunzhou, a resident of Xiema Bridge and Heshangbang, along with two of his nieces (from Zhangpu), were kidnapped by bandits last month. The other day, Wu Shaokang, captain of the county's detective team, apprehended a bandit named Zhou Heshang in Shanghai. Zhou confessed to following the bandit leader Zhou Er Mazi to commit the kidnapping. Currently, Zhou and the hostages are at Yidaizijiao in Shanghai. According to Zhou's confession, Captain Wu reported to County Magistrate Pang, requesting a warrant to lead detectives to Shanghai. They cooperated with the local police station and captured the bandit leader Zhou Er Mazi and bandits Lü A'er and five others inside the Qunle Teahouse in Yidaizijiao. The hostages were not found during the search. The Wang bandits were escorted to Kunshan on the 14th and handed over to the County Public Security Bureau. After interrogation by Director Qin, the bandits confessed to the kidnapping of the Wu family. They stated that the hostages were hidden in a boat in the river near Yidaizijiao. Director Qin detained the bandits temporarily and ordered Captain Wu to go to Shanghai to search for the hostages. On the morning of the 15th, the County Public Security Bureau received a telegram from Captain Wu in Shanghai stating that the hostages had been found and would be escorted back to Kunshan soon.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Silk Factories Request Exemption from Business Tax: Regarding the issue of levying business tax on silk factories in Wuxi, the industry association previously sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to forward a letter to the Business Tax Bureau, stating that it would be difficult to bear the business tax before the export tax was abolished. The bureau submitted a report to the provincial authorities for review. An order was then received stating, "The business tax is levied based on capital and turnover, which is different from taxes levied on goods. Silk factories fall within the scope of manufacturing and should be subject to business tax. The export tax is a customs revenue, unrelated to the abolition of 'li' taxes, and even less related to business tax. The request should not be discussed." Upon receiving the order, the industry referred to Article 1 of the National Regulations and Article 2 of the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations, which state that all special taxes already levied by the central government and those with separate central regulations are exempt from business tax. Furthermore, the new export tariff schedule has been officially announced by the National Government, with item 181 of the fourth category listing white silk and silk reeling factories, with a tax of fifteen taels of silver per dan. Therefore, this export tax is clearly regulated by the central government and is consistent with the exception stipulated in Article 2 of the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations. Moreover, the export tax is indeed a central government revenue, which also aligns with the provision in Article 1 of the Business Tax Outline that excludes special taxes levied by the central government. If it is said that silk factories fall within the scope of manufacturing and should be subject to business tax, then why are yarn factories, which also fall within the scope of manufacturing, able to be excluded? If it is said that yarn and flour factories are exempt from business tax because the central government levies a consolidated tax on them, then the silk export tax is also levied by the central government, which is the same principle. Why discriminate against silk factories alone? Moreover, silk factories are engaged in foreign trade, and the government should provide special protection to them. However, levying both export tax and business tax seems contrary to the government's intention to protect international trade. Yesterday, the industry again sent the above information to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to forward it to the Business Tax Bureau and to submit it to the central and provincial authorities, requesting approval for exemption from business tax in order to comply with the central government's intentions.</p>
<p>Revision of Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Matters: In order to consolidate tax revenue, the Ministry of Finance recently abolished the previous contractor system and uniformly changed it to direct commissioning. The previous tobacco and alcohol transit tax, which resembled "li" tax, was decided to be abolished. The tax rates for public sales licenses were increased to compensate. Currently, the Jiangsu Province Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau is dividing the entire province into tax districts. The tax rates for public sales and license sales are divided into thirty-two districts, and the license tax is divided into ten districts. The tax rates for public sales and licenses are each increased by 30%. The total amount for the entire province is estimated to be over 1.9 million yuan. The list of candidates for the heads of the district branches has also been submitted by Bureau Chief Guan Yinlun to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Gu Daosheng from Wuxi has been appointed as the Chief of the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Branch in Chuan Chongqi, with an annual quota of slightly less than 90,000. Chen Henian has been appointed as the Chief of the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Branch in Wu Kunjiang Chang Taijia, with an annual quota of slightly over 100,000 yuan. Yu Yunqing is the Chief of the Wuxi Tobacco and Alcohol Public Sales Branch. The Wuxi Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax is under the jurisdiction of the Wuxi Yin District, and the position of Chief of the Collection Branch has been appointed to Yun Fubin from Changzhou. Chen Henian, who was originally the Chief of the Wuxi Stamp Tax Bureau, has been replaced by Mao Xieding. The handover is expected to take place soon.</p>
<p>Wujin Business Tax Bureau Detains Dry Cocoon Boats: After fifteen silk factories, including Yongtai Gan and Shen, opposed the business tax on the cocoon industry, a resolution has yet to be reached. The Wujin Business Tax Bureau, due to the lack of a confirmed method for taxing the cocoon industry in the county, has dispatched personnel to various cocoon businesses to collect taxes separately. However, the cocoon season this year has been poor and has already ended for those who started early. A checkpoint has been established in Henglin Town, requiring all dry cocoons being transported to complete the business tax payment. Whenever cocoon boats pass by, they are ordered to stop for inspection. Most of the silk factories in Wuxi purchase cocoons from Yixing, Piaoyang, Jintan, Danyang, and other counties. They must pass through Henglin when transporting the cocoons back, and they are all intercepted and ordered to pay the business tax. Yesterday, dry cocoons transported from Jintan by Yongtai Silk Factory were also detained and have not been released yet. Upon hearing this, the silk factories believe that silk merchants are being disturbed by disguised checkpoints after the abolition of "li" taxes, which violates the central government's intention not to burden the people or hinder commercial development. They have decided to report the illegal actions of the head of the county's Business Tax Bureau to the central government and the Control Yuan for rectification. Railway Police Department Investigates Allegations: Yang Chunxiang (from Anhui Taozhou), owner of the Yuelai Teahouse on Hanchang Road outside Guangfu Gate, carried meeting funds to Dadesheng Grocery Store in Zhoushanbang to participate in a rotating credit association at 2:00 PM on the 4th of this month. While passing by the station, he was stopped by railway patrol officer Zhang Baokun, who fabricated accusations to Section Chief Feng of the Wuxi Station Police Section. Section Chief Feng, without careful inquiry, arrested Yang, locked him with iron chains, and extorted a confession through torture. After Yang argued reasonably, Section Chief Feng reluctantly transferred him to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Upon learning of this, the Anhui Native Association in Wuxi felt greatly aggrieved and sent an official letter to the Public Security Bureau, requesting justice and a thorough investigation of the false accusation. After being bailed out by the association, Yang hired lawyer Tang Ying to file a lawsuit with the County Court. Meanwhile, he reported to the Anhui Native Association in Wuxi, requesting justice. The association submitted separate reports to the Ministry of Railways, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, and the Police Department, requesting a thorough investigation and severe punishment. After receiving the report, the Police Department dispatched someone named Yang to Wuxi yesterday to investigate. After confirming the facts, they returned to Shanghai to report.</p>
<p>Tao Tingfang Intimidates and Extorts Money: Sun Zuhong, a lawyer from this county, was previously resented by Tao Tingfang and Tao Zhusun because he refused their commission. The Tao family falsely accused lawyer Sun on the pretext. On the 6th of this month, while lawyer Sun Zuhong was having lunch at the Recuperation Hospital inside Guangfu Gate, Tao Tingfang used intimidation to extort 200 silver dollars from lawyer Sun, with the assistance of Tao's friend, Yang Yunqiu, in the extortion. Lawyer Sun Zuhong immediately filed a complaint with the County Court's Prosecutor's Office, stating the facts. After receiving the complaint, the Prosecutor's Office issued an order yesterday to summon them for a hearing on a scheduled date.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Police Team Captures Multiple Bandits: Yu Shiquan, captain of the First Platoon of the Pan Shu Town Police in Wuyi County, dispatched his team on the morning of the 14th, around 1:00 AM, to join the Jiangyin Xiqiao Town Defense Corps in suppressing bandits in the Huagang Kou area. They captured four suspects, Yan Shenglin, Wang Dehai, Lü Heshang, and Zhang Bing Yatou, inside the Wudou Temple. Advancing to the Jia Hui Village area, they captured Jiang Genfu and found a Type 2 wooden-cased gun, eight bullets, and military uniforms in the water tank of his house. Subsequently, they apprehended Xie Zhaohai, who was acting suspiciously. All were sent to the platoon headquarters for preliminary interrogation. Jiang Genfu confessed to committing robbery, while the other suspects were evasive. Captain Yu dispatched his team on the 15th to escort them to the city and hand them over to the county for further investigation.</p>
<p>Three Sailing Boats Robbed En Route: Three sailing boats from Lijiabridge, Maojiabridge, and Nanzhai in Wuyi County were robbed at gunpoint while passing through the Nanni Bridge area in the Sixth District around 1:00 AM on the 14th. The total losses for the three boats amounted to several hundred yuan. Afterwards, the Sixth District Office reported to the county government, requesting an investigation.</p>

<p>Second Police Platoon Captures Bandit: The bandit Fang Yeren forced the boatman Yang Longzhang to ferry him to You from Huxi Taipingji yesterday morning. However, around 10:00 PM the night before (the 12th), he was discovered by the Second Police Platoon while moored north of the Great King Temple at the West Gate of this city. Captain Xia, together with Captain Li of the waterfront merchant corps, apprehended the bandit Fang. They escorted the boatman Yang Longzhang and his grandson Wu Xiaoniuzi and handed them over to the Second Police Platoon. At 5:00 PM this afternoon, they were transferred to the county government by the brigade headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>Guard Escapes with Weapons and is Apprehended: Zhang Ji'an, a guard of the Rugao County Security Corps, secretly stole two box cannons and twelve bullets from the team some days ago and escaped. After learning that the guard was hiding in Zhenjiang, the Public Security Bureau of that county dispatched Patrol Officer Ji Shiming and detective Li Dianqing, together with Zheng Jinsheng, captain of the First District Security Corps, to Zhenjiang to apprehend Zhang and his accomplice Han Guoxiang two days ago. When asked about the location of the hidden guns, they said they were hidden in the house of Han's mistress in Yangzhou. The patrol officer and others came to Yangzhou early this morning and searched the premises at No. 15 Pishi Street in this city, discovering a box cannon and twenty bullets. They were immediately taken to the corps headquarters for temporary detention.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>Continued Interrogation in Gambling Arrest Shooting Death Case: The Jiaxing County Public Security Bureau, together with the Jiashan Patrol Team, arrested gamblers at Tangjiagang, located at the intersection of Jiaxing and Jiashan counties. Gambler He Xueyin, carrying paper money on his person, fled and was shot and killed by a police officer. It is reported that the family of the deceased has not only petitioned the Jiaxing court to conduct a post-mortem examination and seek justice but has also hired lawyer Zheng Zhaochen to pursue litigation. County Magistrate Liang Bugeng of Jiashan has placed four police officers involved under surveillance and personally conducted an on-site investigation of the truth in Tangjiagang. Gao Derun, Director of the Jiaxing County Public Security Bureau, also went to investigate everything the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Allegations of Malfeasance in the Opium Case: Relevant Parties Interrogated: After the Jiaxing Xinji Public Security Branch was discovered to have taken bribes to release opium offender Zhu Liesan and embezzled opium, the County Public Security Bureau placed the branch's patrol officer Zhou Xingde under surveillance and handed him over to the court for interrogation. Patrol Officer Zhou claimed that this was done under the orders of Bureau Chief, so the court ordered the relevant branch director Wang Maolie, clerk Ma Xiaoman, patrol captain Yu Xiqi, etc. to appear on the 19th for interrogation, and ordered the arrest of the opium offender Zhu Liesan who was on the run, to investigate and punish,</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Kidnapping Ring Leader Escorted to Province: In the case of the kidnapping of the Wu Jiaxiang father and son, wealthy merchants from Cixi, who were released after a ransom of tens of thousands of yuan was paid. Zhang Guoming, a bandit involved in the case, was arrested in the county and executed. He confessed that the ringleader Chen Guojie (aka Cheng Guoliang) was hiding in Shanghai. The provincial government sent Ning detectives to arrest him and detain him in the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. After the detectives returned to the province and reported, the Security Department ordered Lu Lexi to go to Shanghai, prepare documents, and escort him back. He was escorted to the province by night train on the 14th and temporarily handed over to the Army Prison for detention pending trial.</p>
<p>County Magistrate's Wife Goes to Court for Injury Examination: The other day, Magistrate Yi of Dangyang County had a dispute with his wife, Zhang Xiuying, over a minor matter, which escalated into a physical altercation, resulting in injuries to Zhang. Unwilling to let the matter rest, Zhang came to Hangzhou and filed a complaint with the Hangzhou County Local Court yesterday, requesting an injury examination. The criminal court prosecutor ordered a clerk to conduct the examination. It is reported that there are some jurisdictional issues with this case because it is a preliminary case and should fall under the jurisdiction of Fuyang. However, since the defendant is the County Magistrate of Fuyang and also a judicial officer, he should petition the High Court to designate jurisdiction and then review the case.</p>
<p>Nanchang</p>
<p>Jiangxi Disaster Relief Calligraphy and Painting Assistance Association Established: The disaster situation in this province is severe. Beijing and Shanghai have sent special disaster relief commissioners with funds to Jiangxi for relief.

<h3>Ministry of Education's Interpretation Regarding Academic System and Educational Association Members</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education received a telegram from the Shaanxi Education Department stating that in order to seek education for students and Shaanxi's need for talent, it is proposed to recruit a number of senior high school graduates and provide funding for them to study at designated domestic universities. However, Shaanxi Province has not had senior high schools before. The high school reorganized from Xi'an Zhongda University has not yet reached the graduation period. At a time when talent is lacking, cultivation cannot be delayed. It is now proposed to strictly examine graduates from the old-system middle schools according to the senior high school level, approve a quota, and provide funding to various schools for further studies. Considering the situation in the disaster-stricken Northwest, can it be considered and accommodated? Respectfully request instructions to follow. The Ministry of Education replied, "Graduates from the old-system middle school are equivalent to the first grade of the current senior high school system and cannot directly enter the university. However, the admission qualifications for specialized schools have a provision for admitting one-fifth of those with equivalent academic ability to senior high school graduation. Please refer to it." The Ministry of Education also received a telegram from the Hebei Education Department stating that it had approved a letter from the Hebei Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee stating, "An investigation of the members of the education associations in various counties revealed that some library and newspaper reading room staff, education bureau document processing personnel, and lecturers do not seem to be considered educational administrative personnel and school staff." How should this be handled? As the case concerns the interpretation of laws and regulations, it is appropriate to telegram for verification. The Ministry of Education replied, "Libraries and newspaper reading rooms are social education institutions. Their staff, except for accountants, general affairs staff, clerks, and secretaries, in accordance with Article 16, paragraph 1 of the Education Association Law, may not be members of the education association. Other staff members have the qualifications of members of the education association. As for the staff of the Education Bureau, all staff members above the rank of section member and equivalent to section members are current educational administrative personnel. In accordance with Article 16, paragraph 2 of the Education Association Law, they may be members of the education association. You are hereby notified."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains Three Difficult Points of the Junior High School Credit System</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education received a request from Jinan University for an explanation of three difficult points of the credit system in the junior high school department. The Ministry of Education instructed, "We have received your request. The difficult points you mentioned regarding the implementation of the credit system are answered separately as follows: (1) The awarding of credits should be based on academic performance. Students who study a required course for one academic year and fail in the first semester should, in principle, retake it in the second semester. However, this often causes difficulties in schools that only have autumn semester start classes. The remedy should be determined based on the number of students who failed. If the number of students is large, in addition to continuing to study the second semester of the course, the school should also open a special class at the same time to supplement the first semester's coursework. If the number of students is small and not enough to open a special class, they should be allowed to continue studying the second semester of the course while supplementing the first semester's coursework on their own outside of class or during holidays. Only after passing the make-up exam can the credit for the first semester be granted. It is said that some students in the school have failed in the first semester but passed in the second semester. These students should choose a time to retake the first semester's coursework and should not be exempted from the exam and directly granted the credit for the first semester. (2) Promotion in the credit system should be determined based on whether the number of failed credits exceeds the limit set by each school. Those who have not exceeded the set limit should be allowed to be promoted. However, the number of credits they study after promotion should be restricted so that they have time to retake the courses they failed. The school should consider this when setting the timetable and try to avoid conflicts. If it is unavoidable, the two methods shown in the previous article should be used to remedy it. (3) If a student has reached the graduation period but still fails one required course, they should be allowed to make it up outside the school. They should be allowed to study outside the school until the end of the semester or academic year and then return to school for a make-up exam. It is not necessary to let them stay in school to retake the course. The formal graduation certificate should be issued after passing the make-up exam. You should follow the instructions above."</p>

<h3>Hanqing Education Fund Subsidy for Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Salaries</h3>
<p>(Shenyang Correspondence) The Liao Hanqing Education Fund Board of Directors was established by Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang, who donated five million yuan of his private property to honor the last wishes of the Grand Marshal. The fund is used to subsidize the public primary and secondary education in Liaoning Province as a permanent fund. The board is composed of enthusiastic educators who are responsible for the custody and distribution of the fund. The entire amount is deposited in the official banks of the Three Northeastern Provinces at a monthly interest rate of 1.2%, yielding a monthly interest of 60,000 yuan and an annual interest of 720,000 yuan. In addition to subsidies, awards, and incentives, the measures for subsidizing the salaries of primary and secondary school teachers are sufficient to promote and encourage public attention to primary and secondary education. This kind of treatment is unprecedented in other provinces in the country, and it is enough to make many poor scholars envious. It is no coincidence that education in Liaoning has been thriving and making rapid progress in recent years. The standard for the distribution of the subsidy is based on the county unit. All primary and secondary school teachers in each county (including principals who do not also teach courses) are evaluated based on their years of service and the quality of their teaching performance and divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Each year, the board of directors entrusts the county education bureau to conduct investigations, evaluations, and reports based on the standards set by the board. After the board of directors approves the reports, the full amount of the subsidy to which the county's teachers are entitled is issued to the education bureau for distribution. Provincial schools are treated as a single unit, and the board of directors entrusts the education department to handle the matter in accordance with the previous procedures. No subsidy is given to primary and secondary school teachers with less than three years of service. Those who are evaluated as Grade A will receive an annual subsidy of 30 yuan, Grade B 26 yuan, Grade C 23 yuan, and Grade D none. Those who continue to serve in a school for more than five years will receive an additional 5 yuan, more than ten years an additional 10 yuan, more than fifteen years an additional 15 yuan, more than twenty years an additional 20 yuan, more than twenty-five years an additional 25 yuan, and more than thirty years an additional 30 yuan. Those who retire after twenty years of service will receive half of their final year's subsidy as a retirement pension for up to five years. Those who retire after twenty-five years of service will receive the pension for up to ten years. Those who retire after thirty years of service will receive the pension for life. If a teacher receiving a retirement pension dies, in addition to the current year's retirement pension, an additional two years' retirement pension will be issued as a survivor's benefit. Regarding the years of service, those who have completed three years or more as of the end of June of the 19th year of the Republic will be considered to have completed three years. The board of directors has completed the review of the subsidy for this year, which has been reported by each county, and it has been decided that it will be distributed separately in late this month.</p>

<p>Special Issue No. 3 of the National Jinan University on the Occasion of the Fourth Anniversary of the Establishment of the University and the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of the Founding of the School</p>
<h3>A Review of Our School's Twenty-Fifth Anniversary</h3>
<p>— Xu Minyi</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, and the days and months never linger. The world's affairs are ever-changing and unpredictable. Everything either progresses or regresses; there is no middle ground. Since its inception, our school has, in the blink of an eye, reached its twenty-fifth anniversary. Like a child, it has grown into a mature adult through arduous years. With burgeoning vitality, it is at the prime of its usefulness. Though it has experienced hardships and even faced a period of stagnation, those who have led the school since its recovery have been determined to manage it diligently and bring about innovative advancements. They have ultimately created this solemn and magnificent institution, the only overseas Chinese university in the country, standing tall in Zhenru, west of Shanghai. However, over these twenty-five years, I wonder how much heart's blood has been poured out and how many public funds of the nation have been expended. Tracing back to the thirty-third year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, Liangjiang Governor-General Duan Fang memorialized and received approval to establish our school in Nanjing's Xuejia Alley, using the Miaoxiang Nunnery as its premises. The first director was none other than our current President Zheng. The following year, it was reorganized into a middle school. In the third year of the Xuantong reign, Director Zheng was transferred elsewhere, and Jiangning's Yang Xichang succeeded him. In March of that year, I returned to China from Panchanama in Borneo, Southeast Asia, bringing back two students, Hong Linfeng and Zheng Bowen. I sent them to the school and stayed there for three days, engaging in earnest conversations with Director Yang. I still remember his words: "Overseas Chinese youths are often of strong and straightforward character. If they are given proper education, the results will be significant. In the future, they can all become pillars of the nation." At that time, the school only had over twenty students sent back at the sole expense of Xu Boxing, the headman of the Chinese Council in Southeast Asia, and some students from Java, totaling no more than thirty. (Xu Boxing was the headman of the Chinese Council in Java and the president of the Chinese School. He returned to China to visit the Nanyang Industrial Exposition and died of illness in Shanghai.) In July of the autumn, I accepted an invitation from the Surabaya Chinese School in Java and returned to the tropics. After arriving in Surabaya, I also managed the affairs of the General Association of Dutch Schools, receiving letters from Director Yang informing me of school affairs and requesting me to promote the school. At that time, there was one most difficult matter to deal with, namely the twenty-odd students sent back by Xu Boxing. Because of Xu's death, no one was providing for their expenses, and the school had to lend them money. In less than a year, over five thousand taels had been advanced, greatly impacting the school's finances. Letters and telegrams were sent to the students' families to request repayment, but none ever repaid. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, the school was immediately closed, and the students dispersed. Those with means returned to Southeast Asia on their own, while the rest lingered in Shanghai, lacking food and clothing and living in constant anxiety. They were then funded by the China and Foreign Life Insurance Company to return to Southeast Asia. This can be considered a small anecdote in the history of the school during the late Qing Dynasty. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, Yuan Xitao served as the Vice Minister of Education and appointed Huang Yanpei and others to restore Jinan School (later Huang and others became party affairs school trustees). In the spring of the seventh year, the ministry appointed Zhao Zhengping as the president, and the school reopened at its original site in Miaoxiang Nunnery. In the spring of the eighth year, I returned from Surabaya with ten students, including Wu Huaiqing, who were admitted to the school by President Zhao and entered the normal, commercial, and middle school departments (all of whom have since graduated and returned to Southeast Asia to work). At that time, the school already had three hundred students, and its scale was roughly established. In September, teacher Bai went to Southeast Asia, and President Zhao invited me to the school to teach and oversee documents. This was the beginning of my time at the school. In the summer of the ninth year, President Zhao resigned, and the ministry appointed Ke Chengyi to succeed him. He was particularly enthusiastic in planning school affairs and deeply trusted by the students. He specially sent teachers to the National Language Training Institute of the Ministry of Education in Beijing to attend lectures on the national language phonetic symbols. After graduating, they returned to the school to teach the normal students. In the autumn of the tenth year, President Ke resigned, and President Zhao returned to his post. He submitted a request to the authorities to issue 100,000 yuan of school bonds to purchase over 300 mu of land in Zhenru to build a new school building and organize Jinan New Village. It was completed in the autumn of the twelfth year, and the male students all moved there, while the female students remained at the Nanjing campus. I also came to Shanghai with them. In the thirteenth year, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War broke out, and the school building was occupied by troops. The entire school moved to Yichang Road in Shanghai, to the Dayou Oil Company. Although the war was fierce, education did not cease. In the autumn of the fourteenth year, President Zhao resigned, and Jiang Qi was appointed to succeed him. Due to the increasing number of students, an additional dormitory was built, and personnel were sent to the Philippines, Java, and other ports to solicit donations. The result was that the donations received were not very large after expenses were deducted. A library was started but not completed. In the first month of the fifteenth year, the school building was again occupied by the Fengtian Army, and all the students moved to Shanghai again. First, they used the Second Normal School of Ximen, and then rented houses in Xinxin Lane in Dapuqiao to hold classes. In April, they moved back. On May 21st, the school's 20th-anniversary celebration was held, and a three-day entertainment was held to celebrate. In the summer of the sixteenth year, President Jiang resigned, and the National Government appointed President Zheng to succeed him, reorganizing it into the National Jinan University. The Nanjing Women's Department was also merged into Zhenru, and the scale began to become grand. On June 6th of the eighteenth year, the Overseas Chinese Education Conference was held at the school. Seventy-eight representatives from China and Siam, British, Dutch, French, and American territories attended. It lasted for seven days and nights, and forty-five resolutions were passed (published in the Nanyang Education Conference Report). Chinese and foreign educators gathered together to discuss education, which was a groundbreaking event in our country. This year, the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang also resolved to establish a board of directors to promote the school to become the highest overseas Chinese institution of the Three Principles of the People. It stipulated that there would be eleven directors and formulated regulations, which were approved by the Central Executive Committee and the Ministry of Education. As for construction, after the library was completed, Lian Yi Hall, the Science Hall, the Girls' Dormitory, the Faculty Dormitory, the Auditorium, the Junior and Senior High School Dormitories, the Middle School Classrooms, and offices were built in succession. In addition, thirteen small Western-style houses were built on the Jinan Village base and rented to faculty and staff for accommodation. In the planning stages are the gymnasium, etc., which will also begin construction soon. In addition, the Jinan Bank was established in the school, specializing in managing students' income and expenses. Currently, in addition to the middle school department, the university department has five colleges: Liberal Arts, Sciences, Law, Business, and Education, with a total of eighteen departments, as well as two specialized departments for diplomacy and teacher training. In addition, the free elementary school was changed to an experimental elementary school under the jurisdiction of the school. Overseas Chinese students from various regions come to study, with as many as one thousand three hundred people, and those coming from various ports are still coming in an endless stream. Unfortunately, due to the limited number of dormitories, it is temporarily impossible to accommodate them all. In addition, a Southeast Asian and American Cultural Affairs Department was specially established to communicate with overseas areas at any time, communicate news from China and Southeast Asia, and edit periodic magazines, Nanyang Research, which are mailed to various educational institutions overseas. A Nanyang Series has also been edited, and more than twenty types have been published! There are still more than thirty types being edited, which will be printed successively. Although the equipment is limited by funding and has not been fully completed, it is still barely sufficient for application. As for the library, there are already 33,050 Chinese and Western books. The graduates of each department are either working for the party and the country or serving the society. They are found in all walks of life, including the military, political, academic, and business circles. Those who are engaged in education in Southeast Asia are especially reputable, and various schools compete to recruit them. There are also many who have accumulated huge wealth in business and hold overseas economic power. In the domestic banking industry, such as the general manager of Shanghai Hefeng Bank, is a graduate of our school. Other banks, such as Xinhua Bank, also have students from our school. There are alumni associations in China, such as in Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shantou, Jiangxi, Jinan, Qingdao, and Wuhan, and there are also alumni associations abroad, such as in Siam, Yangon, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Manila. This year, the Shanghai Alumni Association has asked President Zheng to allocate two acres of land in Zhenru for the construction of the association's headquarters. The drawings have been completed and will be built soon. In the future, it will be used for office work and to receive overseas Chinese who return to China. The sports department has already gained considerable honor in China, and in the seventeenth year and this year, it went south twice. The first time was to the Malay Peninsula, Siam, and Annam, and the second time was to the Philippines. The team also went to Guangzhou to compete. When competing in various ports overseas, it not only won many awards but also promoted the progress of sports in our country, causing foreigners to admire and increase the international status of our country, washing away the insult of being the "sick man of East Asia." Others have studied abroad and obtained doctoral degrees, practice law in Shanghai, and serve as teachers at their alma mater, while others are full-time teachers. There are also those who are studying abroad and have not yet returned. Talented people are emerging one after another, which is the glory of our school. In this short period of time, the school's affairs have developed and achieved such great results, which can be said to be extremely commendable. However, President Zheng still believes that it is not enough. He also plans to move the middle school department back to Nanjing in order to expand it. He also plans to purchase hundreds of acres of land in Zhenjiang and other places to open a large farm and establish a complete agricultural science department on the spot to cultivate agricultural talents so that after completing their studies and returning to Southeast Asia, they will have rich knowledge and experience in cultivation and compete with other races in agriculture. If this is the case, then the future of our school will be bright and unlimited. I have been a member of this school for twelve years. I am ashamed of my own lack of talent and have made no contribution. Now, on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary and the completion of the fourth anniversary of the university, I will write down what I know in a summary, hoping to commemorate this day. It is written in haste, and errors and omissions are inevitable. However, what I regret is that my former colleagues are now as rare as morning stars, which is a pity. Of those I meet every day, there are only three people now (two of whom have left the school once). The rest have either moved into politics and business or moved their desks elsewhere. Thinking of old friends, I can't help but think of the Wei River in the north and the Yangtze River in the east. However, compared to educators in the East and West, they do not consider education to be difficult and tirelessly devote themselves to it as a lifelong career, but their interests seem to be different. Some say that the social environment in our country is very different from that of other countries. Since the environment is different, it is difficult to force them to be the same. How can it be said that educators are fickle and have no perseverance? Is that so? Is it really so? I write this here to record my feelings.</p>

<h3>President Zheng's Memorial Ceremony for Deceased Schoolmates in the Cemetery</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, a public memorial ceremony was held in the school cemetery for the deceased schoolmates. Hundreds of people attended, and President Zheng presided over the ceremony (Secretary-General Fan Shouzhi stood in for him). Bao Shoukang gave a speech, saying that the commemorative ceremony was to celebrate the living and to remember the deceased. His speech went as follows:</p>
<p>"On the twelfth day of June in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, one day before the celebration of the twelfth five-year anniversary of our school's founding and the fourth anniversary of the university's establishment, President Zheng Hongnian, leading all teachers and students of the school, respectfully offers clear wine and ample offerings to the spirits of the deceased students in front of the cemetery, saying:</p>
<p>You students have come here, and your tombs are here. Your souls each have a resting place, some from the Lingnan mountains, others from the warm continents, each with a home. When you came here, you carried books and drums, like guests returning home. As the years changed, you hoped to achieve a little, and your ambitions were not small. But alas, you died tragically in Shanghai, and your wishes were not fulfilled. Your heroic hearts were sheathed, and your talents were confined to the corners of the courtyard, unable to take flight. The humble dwellings are desolate, the autumn and spring frosts and dews are heavy and unbright. The temporary structures are piled high, and words are separated by darkness and light, reaching only long sighs. Some of you were ill and died quickly by your bedsides. The land and people are different, and I know that it is so. The illness lies in the depths of reason. In the past, I adjusted the medicines, and was truly in charge. The heart was not to be pierced, the lungs withered like feathers, and life was not to be relied upon. Alas, you were promising, but you came to nothing, and I shed tears in secret. Orchids bloom in spring, not in autumn dew, who will take care of them? Some of you died without settling your lives, either by hanging yourselves or drowning yourselves. Your intentions were pure, and your meaning can be understood, fulfilling a small faith. Lonely Han Fei, sad Qu Yuan, did not learn to stretch and stretch. Throwing oneself from a cart to drink poison, cutting off the head and breaking the shin, rejecting people with death. Knowing life and death, one death cuts off everything, how can it be said to be returning to benevolence? The past is gone, the tomb door is closed, and I feel guilty and sad. Today, I come to worship. The shepherd's purse is sad in the wind, and the plum rain is dark. Looking at your neighbors, calling your companions, come to this meeting in time. Do you have any pain? Open your hands and feet, and look at your injuries. Are you homesick? Widen your sleeves, and embrace the spring breeze and warmth. On the occasion of this school celebration, the completion of four years, and the passing of twenty-five years. The sound of music rises, graceful and elegant, and many scholars line up. Cherishing old friendships, I alone face a corner, and my joy is about to fall. Raising banners and sending condolences, to settle your spirits. The sound of the ritual is solemn. Alas, come, you students, all around me. Your sadness is my sadness, your joy is my joy, I see you as if you were wounded. I am like your father, and you are like my children, how can I not be hurt? I offer this clear wine, which can reach the nine springs, may you come and enjoy it."</p>

<h3>Post-Marriage Musings</h3>
<p>— (Fu Xuan)</p>
<p>——Encouraging Graduates and Inspiring Current Students——</p>
<p>Today marks the 25th anniversary of the founding of our school and the 4th anniversary of the completion of the university program. In terms of events, preparations have been extensive, with myriad ceremonies awaiting their commencement on the grand stage. In terms of literature, a commemorative album has been published to highlight the occasion, and reports from various departments will detail the events. We have nothing new to add here. However, amidst the grand celebration, there is also a supplementary graduation ceremony for the class of 1929. Graduates either continue their studies or enter the world. Let us set aside those who continue their studies for the moment. Those who enter the world are compared to a young woman leaving her maiden home. It is said, "When a maiden leaves her home, whether she meets a good or bad man determines her life. Whether her mother-in-law is kind or cruel affects her happiness. Once she returns home, she will have much to say to her sisters-in-law, brothers, and parents. Yet, she may not freely speak of her husband's shortcomings, but a harsh mother-in-law's stern face is easily seen. Thus, complaints are many, and pleasant stories are few, forced smiles are common, and tears are frequent. Only then does one realize how difficult it is to live in the world. One is either wounded by the treachery of human relationships or laments the futility of serving others. Leaving school and entering the world is much the same. Finding a job is like marrying a husband. Society is like the mother-in-law. In these times of economic hardship and youthful extravagance, few can fulfill their duties." I respond, "This is the situation of the past. Whether a maiden marries a good or bad man is ultimately predetermined. But those who leave school and enter the world today are like maidens who have been cast out, their future uncertain. They cannot find work, nor do they have a home to return to. Even if they find a place to perch, they must either compromise or use skills they did not learn. This leaves them feeling lost and empty. It is like the women of old, bound by etiquette and forced by harsh authority, who resigned themselves to their fate, inevitably leading to widespread complaints! Today's graduates may meet a good match and rejoice, or they may be forced to compromise, their faces filled with sorrow, or they may find no one to ask for advice, lamenting in empty rooms. Once they return to their alma mater, they will discuss worldly matters with their sisters and friends. Laughter, anger, scolding, tears, comfort, and complaints will mingle in the air. At this grand gathering, their emotions will be beyond description. Recalling the days of carefree ambition, cultivating oneself in solitude, cherishing harmonious friendships, and experiencing deep teacher-student bonds, they will be reluctant to leave the school gates again.</p>
<p>Although our experiences of joy and sorrow after leaving school differ, and our emotions vary accordingly, there are several things that must be clearly understood. The current Chinese society is unstable, riddled with problems. The distress of young people is immeasurable, and the difficulty of finding a way out is beyond words. Ultimately, this is due partly to the nature of society and partly to their own confusion:</p>
<p>Those who have experienced the world can describe in detail the ugly face of society. To seek a position, flattery and fawning are the prerequisites, and currying favor is the path to advancement. The shrewd criticize this as being lowly and subservient, while the upright scold it as being pedantic and impractical. Those who hold ideals and strive for integrity often find themselves lost and uncertain, unable to use their talents. As a result, resentment arises at home, criticism is leveled at society, and highly educated unemployed individuals dare not defend themselves. The so-called summoning of talent and welcoming of the worthy have disappeared today.</p>
<p>Even if one happens to find an opportunity, one is constantly fearful of losing it. Those who work diligently are ridiculed by their colleagues for "seeking favor." Those who are occasionally negligent are scolded by their superiors for "neglecting their duties." The mediocre are laughed at by their colleagues for being useless. The capable are pushed aside by both superiors and subordinates. Friendship turns into enmity, and relatives become like fire and water. Those seeking positions at the door are constantly slandered by those seeking to replace them. Moreover, people's minds differ, each as unique as their face. They praise outwardly but scheme inwardly. We are thus lost in a fog, unable to predict whether fortune or misfortune awaits us. The difficulty of working is thus evident. What is described above is only a fraction of the reality! As for the darkness of society and the decline of morality, it is extremely difficult to remain untainted. One is enticed by one thing and chased away by another. Bad habits become ingrained, which is truly lamentable. This ugly face of society leaves us in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>(2) Few current students are aware of the hardship of farming, and many are accustomed to extravagant lifestyles. They often believe that creating things in society is easy. They enjoy empty rhetoric and disdain practical skills. They even build castles in the air, believing that upon graduation, they will immediately ascend to high positions, like Gao Yao, sitting in high halls, displaying their glory to the world. Once they enter the world, they find a completely different path. Those in lowly positions are unwilling to compromise, while those with great responsibilities are unable to bear the burden. Moreover, they are using skills they did not learn, resulting in great effort and little effect! As a result, the dejected become passive, and the radical become extreme. Society becomes more chaotic, and it becomes more difficult to advance or retreat. This is one responsibility that we ourselves must bear.</p>
<p>Within the dormitory, it is like an inn. Those who skip classes boast of being "detached," while those who study diligently are ridiculed as being "bookworms." "Fashion" is their dream, and "pleasure" is their ideal paradise. Once they leave school and find employment, they find it dry and uninteresting, unable to settle into their jobs, or they lack specialized skills and are unable to handle tasks effectively, forcing them to resort to deception and trickery in the hope of survival. As a result, the strong become arrogant, and the weak are broken. Society becomes more chaotic, and it becomes more difficult to advance or retreat. This is another responsibility that we ourselves must bear.</p>
<p>Now that you have gathered here, your perceptions and feelings may not be exactly as described above, but the aforementioned aspects are undeniable features of the ugly face of society. Although the past is gone, the future can be improved. Graduates, having experienced hardship, should not bear to see current students repeat their mistakes. They should offer advice based on their experiences to prepare them for what lies ahead. This is also the purpose of the post-marriage advice upon returning home. Therefore, I would like to encourage the current students:</p>
<p>"Many of you are still unmarried, waiting to be betrothed. In a few years, whether you will leave home in marriage or be cast out is still unknown. However, the ways of the world must be understood. Society is turbulent, and human nature is unpredictable. How should you prepare to respond and advance? To avoid being criticized for being impulsive or feeling lost? How should you motivate yourselves in your studies and career choices? To avoid being incompatible with your roles and exhausted by your work? So that you do not end up washing your hands and entering the kitchen, unfamiliar with your mother-in-law's tastes."</p>
<p>I graduated not long ago and stayed at the school to serve. It is like a married woman returning to her maiden home, not yet having left her own door. I have only experienced a fraction of the hardships of the world. My shallow words may be laughed at by those in the know. But moved by my feelings, I have described them in detail as a filler for the commemorative publication. June 14th</p>

<p>A Glimpse of the Second Executive Committee</p>
<p>Origins: This Executive Committee is in charge of achievement exhibition matters, which is one of the most interesting and most difficult tasks of the commemorative meeting. Although our school has been established for twenty-five years, it has only been reorganized into a university for four years. Thanks to the diligent planning of President Zheng and the support and assistance of people from all walks of life, we have been studying diligently day by day. However, our achievements are not comparable to those of renowned and advanced universities at home and abroad. Nevertheless, we dare not keep our knowledge to ourselves. We take this opportunity to contribute our knowledge and seek guidance and criticism from educational leaders and people from all walks of life, so that we can use it as a spur to improve. This is what this Executive Committee hopes for.</p>
<p>Personnel: This Executive Committee is headed by the deans of all colleges and the head of the registration department, with the full participation of all faculty and students of the university department.</p>
<p>Location: The location of the achievement exhibition was originally in the library. However, due to the small space of the library, which may not be sufficient, it was decided to use the entire science hall as the achievement exhibition hall. This building has three floors and forty rooms, and is located in the center of the school, surrounded by flowers and trees, with a gentle breeze. We hope that the guests who come to visit and provide guidance will not be troubled by the heat. The layout of each room is as follows:</p>
<p>Ground Floor</p>
<p>Room 2: Specimen Manufacturing Room</p>
<p>Room 3: Botany Research Room</p>
<p>Room 4: Zoology Research Room</p>
<p>Room 5: Instrument Display Room</p>
<p>Room 6: Animal Evolution Sequence Display Room</p>
<p>Room 7: Biological Tissue Display Room</p>
<p>Room 8: Plant Specimen Display Room</p>
<p>Room 10: Animal Specimen Display Room</p>
<p>Room 11: Plant Specimen Display Room</p>
<p>Room 12: Slide Room</p>
<p>Room 14: Men's Restroom</p>
<p>Room 15: Women's Restroom</p>
<p>Room 16: Registration Department Display Room and Guest Lounge</p>
<p>Second Floor</p>
<p>Room 17: Physics Experiment Dark Room</p>
<p>Room 19: Physics Instrument Room</p>

<p>Room 28: Physical Education Display Room</p>
<p>Room 29: Law School Display Room</p>
<p>Room 30: Business School Display Room</p>
<p>Room 31: Office of the Science School</p>
<p>Room 32: Research Room of the Science School</p>
<p>Room 33: Cultural Enterprise Department Display Room</p>
<p>Room 34: Physics Instrument Room</p>
<p>Room 35: Photography Display Room</p>
<p>Third Floor</p>
<p>Room 36: Chinese Painting Display Room</p>
<p>Room 37: Liberal Arts School Display Room</p>
<p>Room 38: Chinese Painting Display Room</p>
<p>Room 39: Chinese Painting Display Room</p>
<p>Room 40: Western Painting Display Room</p>
<p>Room 41: People's School Display Room</p>
<p>Room 42: Western Painting Display Room</p>
<p>Room 43: Psychological Instrument Display Room of the Education School</p>
<p>Conclusion: The preparation for the achievements of this Executive Committee is said to be complicated. However, due to limited funds and short time, we have not been able to contribute everything we wished. In addition, the science hall was originally a science experiment room and could not be fully utilized. The arrangement is likely to be incomplete. We hope that the guests will understand.</p>
<p>Brief News</p>
<p>(1) The Alumni Association of the Law School, the Alumni Association of the Education School, the Alumni Association of the Liberal Arts School, and the Alumni Association of the Science School jointly presented a clock to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the establishment of the university and the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the school. It is said that the clock will be delivered later due to manufacturing reasons.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Wang Weiyin, a business graduate of our school who won the Shanghai Four English Speech Championships, believes that the Republic of China should not practice speeches, but there are few books on specialized speech research in the publishing industry. Mr. Wang has collected English speeches and debate speeches from various universities across the country and compiled them into a publication for reference. The book contains more than 30 articles and has been printed by Datong Bookstore and will be published next month. This is good news for the publishing industry and welcome news in the commemorative voice.</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Zhu Weiwen, a graduate currently serving as the principal of Quanzhou Middle School in Fujian, telegraphed: "Respectfully to President Zheng of Jinan University, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the founding of the alma mater, I extend my sincere congratulations, Zhu Weiwen."</p>
<p>Completed editing</p>
<p>This special publication has received many submissions, but due to limited space, we cannot publish them all, which we deeply regret.

<h3>Today, All Sectors Hold Meetings to Commemorate the Passing of the Premier</h3>
<p>Held at the City Party Headquarters at 9:00 AM</p>
<p>Today (the 16th) is the ninth anniversary of the Premier's martyrdom in Guangzhou. The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters has specifically scheduled a commemorative meeting to be held today at 9:00 AM in the Grand Auditorium on the third floor of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters on Lin Yin Road in the South City. The City Executive Committee issued a statement to the public yesterday, saying,</p>
<h3>Studying Methods for Sino-Japanese Cooperation</h3>
<p>The National Goods Association Holds a Scheduled Meeting</p>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association sent a letter to various organizations yesterday, saying, "Respectfully, since Japan has imposed a heavy tax of 100% on Chinese goods, millions of farmers, industrialists, and merchants in our country who rely on exporting to Japan and South Korea have been deprived of their livelihoods, displaced, and in dire straits. Our association has repeatedly joined forces with domestic and foreign organizations, promoted equality, and exchanged letters and telegrams, calling for rescue. However, Japan's ambition is rampant, and the effect is equal to zero. After the National Government unified the country and laid the foundation, our diplomatic authorities negotiated with Japan again and again, and finally signed the Sino-Japanese Agreement in May of the 19th year of the Republic of China, reducing the heavy tax by 30%, which is 70%. The agreement was for a period of three years, ending in May of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Our association believes that agreements between countries must be based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. Today, the transportation of goods to China and the transportation of Chinese goods to Japan are taxed unequally, which is a major obstacle. Therefore, Japanese goods can be sold smoothly in China, while Chinese goods are still difficult to transport to Japan and South Korea.</p>
<p>This kind of pain must be fundamentally eradicated to save the lost rights and maintain the livelihood of the industrial and commercial sectors engaged in foreign trade. Therefore, on the 7th of the lunar month last month, we telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting permission to convene relevant organizations to study and amend the Sino-Japanese Agreement and submit it to the ministry for adoption. After review, on the 15th, we received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating, "I have received your telegram of the 1st. Regarding the tariff rate for Chinese goods imported into Korea in the future after the current agreement expires, you may convene relevant organizations to study how to propose amendments and submit them to the ministry for consultation with the Ministries of Finance and Industry for review and handling. A special telegram is sent in reply. Ministry of Foreign Affairs (seal)." In view of this, we believe that the agreement is of great importance to our country's economy and people's livelihood. Now that the agreement period is about to expire, we should pool our wisdom and efforts to study new agreement methods and cooperate to proceed, so that we can gather wisdom and benefit, and avoid digging wells when thirsty and repeating the same mistakes. Therefore, we have specifically scheduled a joint meeting of various organizations to be held at 3:00 PM on the 23rd of this month at our association's office on Nine Acres of Land in Shanghai to discuss and study various concrete methods for the Sino-Japanese Agreement in order to proceed properly. At the meeting, the full text of the Sino-Japanese Agreement printed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be distributed so that each article can be studied. At that time, we earnestly request that your office, association, or guild send representatives to attend and participate in the discussion and express your opinions for public resolution and implementation. We are deeply grateful for your prompt and active participation. With best wishes for your well-being."</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Permits Resumption of Business for Domestic Goods Department Store</h3>
<p>Results of Negotiations by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>However, the Department Store is Unwilling to Open Automatically</p>
<p>The China United Domestic Goods Department Store has been closed by order of the Public Works Department for seven days and remains closed. After the Ministry of Industry and Commerce sent officials to negotiate, the Public Works Department has agreed to allow it to resume business. However, the department store itself is unwilling to open automatically. The various developments of yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>Negotiation Process: After receiving instructions from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce sent officials to thoroughly investigate the facts of the Domestic Goods Department Store. Subsequently, Li Zejin was dispatched to the Public Works Department to negotiate with the Director-General, Mr. Fessenden. The day before yesterday, together with the Director-General of the Public Works Department, Mr. Fessenden, Municipal Advisor Wu Jingxiong, Deputy Director He Dehui, and representatives from the Fire Brigade's Engineering Department, they went to the department store to inspect the various facilities. As a result, the Public Works Department agreed to allow the department store to resume business, but stipulated that the equipment in the amusement section must be completely improved. Yesterday, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce sent Pan Zengyin and Ji Zejin to the department store for further discussions. Because the Public Works Department had sealed the doors, the department store insisted that the Public Works Department should also be the one to open them and refused to open automatically.</p>
<p>A Discussion: Yesterday at 2 PM, Chinese members of the Public Works Department, Yu Qiaqing, and Chairman of the Ratepayers' Association, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jilong, and Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wang Yansong, invited Zhen Yulian from the Domestic Goods Department Store to a discussion. Yu and others stated that the department store should immediately resume business, and they would be responsible for handling all negotiations regarding losses. However, Mr. Zhang argued that the Public Works Department's illegal use of force was related to the business security of Chinese ratepayers within the concession. Until the principles of fairness, law, and responsibility for enforcement and handling were clarified, it would be inappropriate to open the doors without authorization, resulting in little progress in the discussion. It was agreed that further discussions would be held the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reply to the Public Works Department: Yesterday, the Domestic Goods Department Store sent a letter to the Public Works Department, stating: "In reply to your letter No. 1121 of June 13th, regarding the letter sent by Mr. Zhang Deyin, Director of the Amusement Section of this department store, on June 4th, we have fully understood its contents. We hereby reply in detail and request your attention: (1) This department store is a department store engaged in the business of domestic goods. Apart from needing a license for the attached amusement section, this department store does not need to obtain a license according to your department's regulations, and there is no violation of regulations. The Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun companies also have attached amusement sections. Even if the amusement sections of the aforementioned three companies violate regulations, your department can only exercise its powers over their amusement sections and cannot stop the entire business operations due to violations in the amusement sections. (2) If your department believes that the attached amusement section of this department store violates regulations, according to the regulations of the license issued by your department, you can only stop the business of the amusement section, preventing tourists from buying tickets to enter. You cannot close its doors, cut off its access, and should not, without an order from the competent court, arbitrarily stop the entire business operations of this department store, close all the iron gates, and cut off its access. From this, it can be seen that your department's actions this time not only exceed the scope but also show contempt for the Chinese court, violate agreements, and infringe upon the court's authority. (3) The location of the attached amusement section of this department store is the same as the former New World before May 1st, which was approved and licensed by your department. The original equipment for handling amusement activities, like the New World, has not been changed, and the amusement activities have not been interrupted. There has been no time for changes. Why is it that your department considered the former New World satisfactory and issued a license, while you consider the amusement section with the same equipment attached to this department store unsatisfactory and refuse to issue a license? Furthermore, this department store took over the former New World based on its possession of a license that your department considered satisfactory and permitted to operate an amusement business. Now, your department suddenly expresses dissatisfaction with the attached amusement section of this department store. The responsibility for this inability to make a clear decision should be borne by your department. (4) Your department's letter states that the various changes proposed by your department are to protect the safety of the public's lives and property. Protecting the safety of the public's lives and property is your department's responsibility and a responsibility that your department must not neglect; otherwise, it would lose the original intention of all taxpayers setting up your department. This meaning and responsibility have a long history and should, of course, be consistent and identical before and after May 1st. Therefore, the New World amusement license issued by your department before May 1st should be the same as the amusement license issued to the amusement section attached to this department store after May 1st, paying careful attention to protecting the safety of the public's lives and property. Otherwise, it would be a violation of duty and bear corresponding responsibility. According to this, your department must have carefully considered and been very serious when issuing the amusement license to the former New World before May 1st, recognizing that all its equipment was completely legal and satisfactory before issuing the license. Why is it that after May 1st, you say that the same equipment is illegal and unsatisfactory? This is no different from your department stating that the previous issuance of the license was negligent, or that the safety of the public's lives and property before May 1st did not need to be protected. Upon investigation, your department's letter is a reply to the public letter sent by Mr. Zhang Deyin, Director of the Amusement Section of this department store, on June 4th, indicating that your department did not think there was no room for discussion in the June 4th letter and felt it was necessary to reply. This reply should have been made by your department before using force to order the closure on June 9th and should not have been delayed until June 13th. Furthermore, after this department store signed a contract to take over the former New World on April 20th, the Director of the Amusement Section, Mr. Zhang Deyin, applied to your department for a license transfer on April 28th. At that time, your department sent two Chinese constables, Nos. 632 and 709, and two fire brigade managers to the venue for management and allowed business operations. Even if there were unsuitable internal facilities, there should have been no risk of danger, and a reply discussing and studying Mr. Zhang's letter of June 4th should have been made. Your department did not do this. Your department's actions on June 9th are truly perplexing. Your department's letter states that completing the equipment for the various changes proposed by your department is a condition for this department store to open for business. However, this department store was closed by your department's illegal use of force, which is a matter of the business security of Chinese taxpayers. Therefore, until the principles of fairness, law, and responsibility for enforcement and handling are clarified, we dare not make any statements. This is our special reply."</p>
<p>Group Assistance: Yesterday, organizations such as the Shanghai National Goods Factories Association, the Woodworking Industry Union, the Pollen Industry Guild, and the West City Business Community Association submitted petitions to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting negotiations or sending letters to the department store expressing unified assistance (original text omitted).</p>
<p>Declaration by the Press and Labor Unions: To all public organizations, newspaper offices, elders, brothers, sisters, and compatriots throughout the country: Since the May 30th Massacre occurred in our country, the entire nation has been indignant at the frequent foreign insults and eager to wash away the humiliation, but without a way to do so. Everyone believes that the only way to save the country is to promote domestic goods to resist imperialist economic aggression. The Domestic Goods Factories in Shanghai, in view of this, pooled their efforts to organize the China United Domestic Goods Department Store, hoping to promote domestic goods and recover rights. However, the authorities in the concession, knowing that the development of the department store is detrimental to imperialism, deliberately try to destroy it at every opportunity. This time, the China National Goods Department Store, in order to expand its scope, moved its business from the former site of the Municipal Council on Nanjing Road to the new boundaries of the concession. The Public Works Department dared to create difficulties again and again, refusing to issue a license, and on the 9th of this month, it completely sealed off the department store and beat several employees, including Zhu Qiguang and Huang Xiliang. Such wanton destruction not only disregards our national sovereignty but also violates public law. Anyone with blood in their veins cannot but feel grief and indignation. The national goods movement is being promoted by the central government. The government has announced the recovery of legal rights in the concession. If this incident is not seriously negotiated, where is national sovereignty? Where is the law? We hope that compatriots across the country will quickly provide assistance. We will not give up until we receive a satisfactory response and compensation for losses. We hereby declare.</p>
<h3>Yang Zhaoyun Visits Fessenden Regarding the Sealing of the Domestic Goods Department Store</h3>
<p>The Department Store Section Can Be Opened</p>
<p>The Amusement Section Will Be Temporarily Closed</p>
<p>Since the China National Goods Department Store was suddenly closed by the police on the afternoon of the 9th, the citizens of Shanghai have been deeply surprised by this action of the Public Works Department, considering it to be inconsistent with legal procedures. Even if the department store has violated regulations, the Public Works Department should, in accordance with the agreement, file a public prosecution with the District Court of the Special Area, and the court should make a ruling according to law. It is not appropriate to close the store directly, which would exceed its authority and infringe upon the jurisdiction of our country's courts. Yang Zhaoyun, President of the District Court of the Special Area, believed that the Public Works Department and the District Court had always cooperated on everything, but this unfortunate incident occurred, which was regrettable. Especially since this matter concerns the rights of citizens and the authority of the court, in order to avoid escalating the dispute, he took the initiative to question and hoped for an early resolution. He expressed his opinions to the Public Works Department's legal representative. The Public Works Department's legal representative could not intervene due to limitations of authority. President Yang personally visited the Public Works Department yesterday to meet with Director-General Fessenden to protest in person and request the immediate opening of the store. Mr. Fessenden said that he also recognized that this action was not without error, but stated that he and the Board of Directors had not been informed of it beforehand. As for the National Goods Department Store section, it can be opened immediately and operate as usual, but the amusement section must wait until the fire exits and other equipment are complete due to incomplete facilities and the nature of fire hazards before it can be reopened. President Yang immediately stated that the entire store must be opened. If there are violations of regulations, they can be transferred to the court for handling. Mr. Fessenden said that he had no authority to allow this, but he could report this to the Board of Directors for discussion and remedial measures, which should not be difficult to resolve satisfactorily. He also said that he would convene a temporary Board of Directors meeting this afternoon (the 15th) to expedite the conclusion of this matter. President Yang believed that Mr. Fessenden's reply was sincere and took his leave. Later, it was heard that the temporary Board of Directors meeting was not convened yesterday and has been changed to Wednesday (the 17th). Therefore, this matter will likely be resolved after the Board of Directors meeting tomorrow. The National Goods Department Store will hopefully be opened as early as the 18th.</p>
<h3>Fessenden Discusses the Reasons for Closing the Domestic Goods Department Store</h3>
<p>Stating It Was to Protect the Safety of Citizens' Lives</p>
<p>At approximately 3:30 PM yesterday, the reporter met with Fessenden, Director-General of the Public Works Department, at the department's office. Mr. Fessenden made the following statements regarding the recent closure of the National Goods Department Store: The following is Mr. Fessenden's statement:</p>
<p>"Since the National Goods Department Store was closed, the general reports in the newspapers have been quite different from the facts. From beginning to end, the Public Works Department not only has no intention of opposing national goods but also believes that national goods are of good quality and low price and should be actively promoted. However, promoting national products is one thing, and ensuring the safety of the lives of general customers is another thing. The two must not be confused. I recall that when the National Goods Department Store was opened in the Municipal Council building, there were many flammable materials stored in the store. The Fire Brigade of this department negotiated with Mr. Zhang, the person in charge of the store, several times, informing him of the reasons for the ban and giving him a considerable deadline to make changes in accordance with the regulations, but he ultimately ignored them. After the store moved to the New World, the situation became even worse. In addition to the department store, there were also amusement parks and movie theaters, and the safety equipment in them did not comply with the regulations stipulated by this department. If an accident occurs (such as a fire), there will be many tourists in the venue, and hundreds of lives will be lost. In order to protect the safety of the lives of citizens, how can this department ignore the dangerous situation and fail to take measures to correct it in advance? This is the reason for the closure of the store. The current intention of this department is that the National Goods Department Store can be allowed to operate first, but the amusement section must wait until the fire exits and other facilities are complete before it can be restored."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Proclamation Prohibits Ships from Docking at the Yangzi Wharf</h3>
<p>Due to Yang Ocean Company's Failure to Pay Rent</p>
<p>Ships Docking Will Not Be Cleared Through Customs</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the National Government's Ministry of Communications has announced that the Shanghai Yangzi Wharf in Pudong, Shanghai, owned by the Ministry and leased to the Japanese Ocean Company, has violated the contract by delaying rent payments. The Ministry has notified the company of its cancellation of the lease on the 6th of this month and has also informed the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Jianghai Customs Commissioner to prohibit all Chinese and foreign ships from docking at the wharf from the 11th of this month. Yesterday, the New Sound News Agency reporter specifically visited the Jianghai Customs, the Port Authority, the Western assistant responsible for managing ships, and the general manager of the Ocean Company, Japanese national Funakoshi Shinjiro, to inquire about the customs' management of the wharf and the company's attitude toward the Ministry of Communications' announcement. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Proclamation: To notify the public, the Shanghai Pudong Yangzi Wharf belongs to the Ministry. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the wharf was leased to the Japanese merchant Ocean Company, and a contract was signed for both parties to abide by. However, the company failed to comply for long and delayed rent payments. Over the years, the arrears have been substantial. Despite repeated negotiations, the company has ignored them and repeatedly made excuses for delays. In order to protect property rights, the Ministry must cancel the lease according to the contract and completely recover the wharf. During this period, all Chinese and foreign ships must not dock at the wharf. In addition to notifying the company and consulting the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Jianghai Customs Commissioner not to clear customs for Chinese and foreign ships docking at the wharf from June 11th of this year, we are afraid that it will not be widely known, so we hereby announce.</p>
<p>Port Authority Attitude: According to a certain Western gentleman who assists in ship management at the Jianghai Customs Port Authority, he has not received any orders from the Jianghai Customs Commissioner regarding this matter prohibiting Chinese and foreign ships from docking at the wharf or denying customs clearance. He has only seen this advertisement in the newspaper. As for whether the Ministry of Finance has issued any instructions to the Jianghai Customs regarding this matter, he does not yet know. Therefore, the management of the Port Authority is still the same as for other wharves.</p>
<p>Ocean Company's Statement: The reporter then investigated the Ocean Company's general manager, Mr. Funakoshi Shinjiro. The general manager first told the reporter the history of the wharf, saying that the Yangzi Wharf was originally the property of the Germans. During the European War, because China also participated, the wharf became Chinese property after the European War. The Ocean Company signed a lease with the Chinese Beijing government around 1922 and signed a contract in 1923. Officials in the division could not be sure which property rights belonged to, so the rent could not be paid. However, it has been sent to a certain bank for deposit on a monthly basis. It will be paid immediately after the property owner is clear. The reporter then asked whether the Ministry of Communications had sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance to instruct the customs to prohibit Chinese and foreign seagoing ships from docking at the wharf, whether the company needed to request negotiations with the Japanese ambassador, and the amount of the accumulated rent and the name of the bank where it was deposited. He replied that there was no need to request negotiations with the Japanese ambassador on this matter. The company only sent people to consult with the Ministry of Communications. The total amount of arrears is about 500,000 taels, and the name of the bank where it is deposited cannot be disclosed.</p>
<h3>Shashi Radio Station to Be Able to Communicate Nationally in Three Weeks</h3>
<p>New Motors for Xuzhou and Guiyang to Be Shipped Soon</p>

<p>Page 4</p>
<p>The International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is planning to establish stations in various regions to expand the domestic radio network. Recently, the locations for setting up stations for communication have been confirmed to be Shashi, Xuzhou (Sichuan Province), and Guiyang. The new motor for the Shashi radio station, consisting of twenty-four boxes, has already been shipped. Yan Zhonglin, the chief engineer of the Shashi radio station appointed by the Ministry of Communications, set off yesterday for Shashi to direct the installation of the station. According to Wu Guixiang, director of the bureau, who spoke to a reporter from the Guowen News Agency yesterday, communication between Shashi and radio stations across the country can be realized in three weeks. The new motor for the Xuzhou radio station is currently being installed and will be shipped to Xuzhou in two weeks. The motor for Guiyang will be shipped out in four or five days.</p>
<h3>Fisheries Bureau Officially Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>Director Han Yougang Sworn into Office</p>
<p>The Fisheries Administration Bureau of Jiangsu and Zhejiang officially established yesterday. Director Han Yougang has also arrived at the bureau to take office and held a swearing-in ceremony at 3 PM yesterday afternoon. Zhao Jinqing, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, supervised the ceremony. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Parties: Those who attended yesterday included Zhao Jinqing from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Wu Huanru representing the Bureau of Social Affairs, Chen Yanin representing the Consolidated Tax Bureau, Ding Shuhua representing the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, Liu Shiru from the Trademark Bureau, Ju Zhijing representing the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Special Area Court, and Wu Tinghua and Wang Wentai representing various fisheries experimental stations, totaling over 40 people.</p>
<p>Details of the Swearing-In Ceremony: (1) The Vice Minister takes his place; (2) The person being sworn in takes their place; (3) Everyone stands at attention; (4) Bow three times to the Party, the national flag, and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen; (5) The Vice Minister respectfully reads Sun Yat-sen's will; (6) The Vice Minister supervises, and the person being sworn in raises their right hand and reads the oath; (7) The Vice Minister's instruction; (8) The Director's response; (9) Photograph.</p>
<p>Director's Oath: Director Han's oath stated, "I, Han, solemnly swear that I will abide by Sun Yat-sen's will, obey the Party's principles, abide by the laws, be loyal and diligent in my duties, never waste a single penny, never use a single person improperly, and never engage in private gain, corruption, or bribery. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This is my oath."</p>
<p>Vice Minister's Instruction: After the Director took the oath, Zhao Jinqing, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, delivered an instruction, briefly stating, "Our country's fisheries have always been freely operated by fishermen and merchants. The technology is immature, and few know how to improve it, so there cannot be good development. Moreover, there is exploitation by villains internally and aggression by the Japanese externally, so the future of fisheries is extremely perilous. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has specifically established a dedicated bureau for management in order to uphold Sun Yat-sen's teachings and promote fisheries. From now on, the protection and promotion of fisheries, and the prevention of foreign vessels from seizing resources, must be actively carried out. Director Han has abundant experience in fisheries, and I firmly believe that he can work hard to implement the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's purpose of promoting fisheries," etc. After the Vice Minister finished his instruction, the Director responded, briefly stating that he would abide by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's purpose and the Vice Minister's instruction and work hard in his duties.</p>
<p>Han's Brief Biography: Han Yougang is from Cixi, Zhejiang, 35 years old, and graduated from Soochow University. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, he worked in the press in Beijing, served as secretary to Wang Zhengting, and was the head of the accounting section of the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce. He is currently in this position. It is said that Han's family has been engaged in fisheries for three generations, and there is still a fish market in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Director's Remarks: After the ceremony yesterday, the reporter from the New Sound News Agency specifically asked about the bureau's future plans. It was mentioned that our country's fisheries lose approximately 50 million yuan each year. Liaoning and other places have been seized by Japanese fishermen and merchants, so the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has specially established four regional fisheries administrations: one in Fujian, two in Liaoning, three in Hebei and Shandong, and four in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang region has been established today, and the other regions will also be established in order to promote fisheries. Regarding the implementation plan, in addition to security aspects, a special water police force has been dispatched to prevent bandits and eliminate pests in the fisheries. The most important thing is to improve the technology of fishermen, and the most difficult thing is that the knowledge of the current fishermen is too immature, so methods must be found to guide them and improve them.

<h3>Various Industries' Tax Regulations Committee Requests Exemption from Business Tax on Native Cloth</h3>
<p>The Tax Regulations Research Committee of the various industry associations in this city sent a letter to the Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday, requesting exemption from business tax on the native cloth industry, stating: "Dear Sirs, we have investigated that the native cloth industry is a rare and small-scale handicraft industry in the country. Both the supply and demand sides are poor people. The National Government has resolved to exempt all taxes and levies. Even the customs duties that have been followed over the years were exempted by the Ministry of Finance on May 19th, regardless of whether they are shipped abroad or to areas where consolidated taxes have not been implemented, and the Customs Administration has ordered the Jianghai Customs Commissioner to comply. The business tax currently being drafted in this city does not specify a tax rate for this industry, nor does it specify an exemption. It seems that the main purpose of the National Government's exemptions from taxes and levies should be followed, and an explicit tax exemption should be given so that there is something to follow when taxes are levied in the future. This is also in line with the principle of establishing a business tax to offset local losses from levies. According to the industry's appeal to the association, we are forwarding a letter to you, hoping that your bureau will approve an explicit exemption in order to maintain it. We would be most grateful. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau."</p>

<h3>The Bureau of Commodity Inspection and Testing Publishes "A Simple Explanation of Uniformity Testing of Raw Silk"</h3>
<p>All countries pay attention to the uniformity of raw silk quality (commonly known as "Evenness"). In order to meet this requirement, Japan invented various silk reeling machines, such as the Omikawa type, to achieve uniformity in raw silk. At the same time, silk inspection stations also researched and developed methods and machinery for testing uniformity to assess the degree of uniformity and provide a basis for trade. Manufacturing and testing are considered together, and the great effectiveness can be seen in the situation of Japanese raw silk. The silk manufacturing machinery in our country's silk factories is extremely outdated, and inspection methods and equipment have not been given attention. Although improvements are gradually being made now, there is no clear direction on how to set them up. In view of this, the Raw Silk Inspection Department of the Shanghai Bureau of Commodity Inspection and Testing has specially compiled a booklet entitled "A Simple Explanation of Uniformity Testing of Raw Silk," explaining the structure of the machinery, its operation methods, and the inspection procedures, etc. Yesterday, it was distributed to various silk factories, and a circular was sent to various trade associations to notify all factories to pay attention.</p>
<h3>The Bureau of Commodity Inspection Starts Testing Sugar Yesterday</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Bureau of Commodity Inspection and Testing has added a lot to the commodity inspection, such as raw silk, tung oil, wool, etc. Starting yesterday, it has also added sugar inspection. All sugar merchants who import must report to the bureau to send personnel to inspect. Sugar is divided into nine types, from two and a half Wen to four and a half Wen. The bureau has set the standard for sugar types, which is based on Dutch sugar. The inspection fee is two cents per dan. Zhou Da Yao and Wu Zhuo, two technical officials, are in charge.</p>
<h3>Inauguration of the Joint Righteousness Branch Standing Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Righteousness Society was organized by the late Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Throughout its history, it has repeatedly made contributions to the party and the country. Recently, due to the long absence of the standing committee members, the society's affairs were chaotic and difficult to stop. Now, Tang Hai'an, the current Jianghai Customs Supervisor, has been publicly elected to take over the management of the association's affairs. The inauguration ceremony was held at 3:00 PM on the 14th, with about 60 guests present, creating a grand occasion for a while.</p>
<h3>Year-End Half-Month Bonus for the Two Railway Lines</h3>
<p>Clerks Request Equal Treatment</p>
<p>After the Shanghai-Nanjing and Nanjing-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus ordered their respective departments to prepare lists for the year-end half-month bonus for the 19th year for the workers and employees on the two railway lines, the clerks on the two lines jointly submitted a request to the Railway Bureau a few days ago, stating that since they are all serving on the railway, although the positions are divided into internal and external, the responsibilities are the same. Moreover, there has never been any outstanding treatment in the past. How can we clearly distinguish between them? Therefore, they specifically requested the Railway Bureau to grant them the same treatment.</p>
<h3>Declaration of Silk Workers' Demand to Restore Wages</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sixth and Fourth District Silk Industry Union and the Preparatory Committee of the Special Zone Silk Industry Union, etc., issued a declaration yesterday regarding the issue of restoring the original wages of female workers, stating that since the wages of our industry were stipulated by contract between labor and capital in 1927, they have been mutually observed. Until October of last year, at that time, due to the factory's operating losses, there was a discussion on temporarily reducing wages. The Social Bureau convened a mediation, and both parties sincerely negotiated. At that time, our labor side could not bear to see the factory's business bankrupt, which would affect the national industry, so we demonstrated the spirit of labor-capital cooperation and expressed twelve points of sincerity, willing to save on food and clothing and painfully agree to calculate wages at 85% of the original amount, until the end of May 1941. It was stated that after the expiration date, the wages would remain the same, and temporary implementation conditions were signed on file. Since the reduction of wages for seven months, the suffering of our labor side has been indescribable. However, we only endure the pain for a while, and we always hope that when the term expires, the capital side will naturally restore the wages as agreed, so that we can still maintain our lives. Unexpectedly, the term has now expired, and the capital side has repeatedly delayed the restoration of wages, with no sincerity at all. Such a situation is contrary to the spirit of labor-capital cooperation, and they only use the excuse that silk prices are low and they are unable to maintain the wages. However, we all know that when the wage reduction was negotiated last year, the average silk price was 720 taels, but now the silk price has exceeded 900 taels. Judging from their intentions, they are using all kinds of deceptive words to cover up the authorities' observation and achieve their selfish desires. The silk factory industry is the most numerous in Shanghai, followed by Wuxi. The wages in Wuxi were originally 58 cents, but since the wage reduction in Shanghai, they were also reduced to 53 cents (Shanghai only 51 cents). Until January of this year, they were paid as before. Compared with the living standards in Wuxi and Shanghai, there is no need to argue that everyone knows. Is the business in Wuxi different from that in Shanghai, or are the workers in Wuxi better than those in Shanghai? Now that the eight million silk industry public bonds are about to be issued, even if the capital side suffered losses last year, it will not be difficult to recover with this infusion. The capital side should consider the government's painstaking efforts to help the workers and take care of the workers' pain. They stubbornly refuse to restore the meager wages. I don't know what their intentions are. Now, most of the factories in Shanghai have stopped working. The reason is the lack of raw materials and hoarding, which has nothing to do with the issue of wage restoration. Now, in order to make a living, our workers are struggling to demand the restoration of wages, and we firmly express our determination to achieve our goals. Otherwise, we would rather sacrifice ourselves and there is no room for compromise. We hope that people from all walks of life will give us their sympathy and assistance, and we hope that the authorities will make a fair ruling. This is what the workers pray for day and night. We respectfully declare this and hope for your public consideration.</p>
<h3>Residents Should Follow the New System of Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>Notification from the Taxpayers' Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association issued a notice to the residents of the concession yesterday, advising them to follow the new system of weights and measures, stating the following: Regarding the matter of announcing and implementing the new system of weights and measures, we have received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Government stating that the case of promoting the new system of weights and measures in this city has been repeatedly invited to the Special Zone authorities to hold meetings and discussions, and officials have been sent to attend. The deadline for completing the unification on the first day of this month is approaching. All vegetable markets have already scheduled to implement the new system first on June 1st. The Special Zone is related to the observation of China and foreign countries, and it is appropriate to promote it in a unified manner to establish a good reputation. We have always known that your association is a representative of the citizens, and you are particularly enthusiastic in urging and improving the administration of the Special Zone. We hereby send a special letter to you, hoping that you will assist in promoting the necessity of unifying weights and measures, so that it can be completed as scheduled. The unified system of weights and measures has been a unified need of the people since the Republic of China. The National Government has ordered a thorough unification, and the Weights and Measures Law was promulgated on February 16, 1929. The Ministry of Industry has stipulated the date of implementation in this city. Therefore, all people living within the territory of the Republic of China must abide by and follow it. Those who violate the relevant laws and regulations will be subject to sanctions according to law. Since the old system of weights and measures has been legally abolished, anyone who uses it again is committing a crime. Therefore, we hereby notify the residents of the concession that they should immediately comply with the new Weights and Measures Law. All rulers, dou measures, scales, etc., must be discarded and replaced with new ones as soon as possible. Legal rulers, dou measures, scales, etc., can be purchased from the Weights and Measures Inspection Office of the Xiejiao Manufacturing Bureau Road. Please do not wait and see and harm yourself. This announcement.</p>
<h3>Brokerage Industry Requests Business License</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter Requesting to Determine the Location</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Coal and Charcoal Trade Association requesting an explanation of the scope of the broker's tax and the location for applying for a business license. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the Business Tax Preparatory Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau, requesting it to consider the matter. The original text is recorded as follows: Dear Sir, on the 13th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Coal and Charcoal Trade Association, stating that according to the announcement of the Shanghai County Government, those who pay the brokerage tax will no longer pay the business tax, but must apply for a business license. In the future, will this business license be obtained on behalf of the Shanghai County Government, or will it be obtained directly from the Municipal Finance Bureau? Please investigate and indicate, etc. It has been reported to the association that the coal and charcoal industry has always obtained licenses and paid the brokerage tax. The reason for this question is that the brokerage tax belongs to the county, while the business license belongs to the city. The jurisdictions of the two are different, so there is this question. In the future, merchants who pay the brokerage tax should apply for a business license in accordance with Article 4 of the regulations. If the brokerage tax is collected by the County Finance Bureau and the business license is also forwarded by the County Finance Bureau, it seems to be too circuitous. Correspondingly, we have sent a letter for your consideration, and we ask your office to determine the method for transfer.</p>
<h3>Jihe Steamer Damages Wooden Boat</h3>
<p>Collision: The Jihe steamer of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., which returned to Shanghai from Hankou this time, stopped the ship to allow passengers to go ashore in Jiangyin at 1:00 AM on the 14th, as usual, and temporarily threw a river anchor. At that time, the Jihe had already stopped the ship, and was about to launch a sampan to transfer passengers ashore, but there was already a large private ship transporting wood there, commonly known as the "duck butt boat," transporting wood from Shanghai to the Fairy Temple in Yangzhou, which had anchored in Jiangyin for the night. The Jihe steamer was impacted by the upstream water, the ship moved, and hit the wood-transporting boat horizontally. The wooden boat could not avoid it, and the bow was violently hit by the Jihe steamer, and it was immediately destroyed. Fortunately, the ship was huge and was not sunk, but the head was severely damaged. The iron railing and four iron support columns on the left side of the Jihe steamer were also broken, which shows the intensity of the collision. Fortunately, there were no injuries at both boats entrance.</p>
<p>Compensation: After the Jihe caused the accident, the wood-transporting boat was seriously damaged, and the wooden boat was anchored when it was hit by the Jihe. The responsibility lies with the British ship. The owner of the wooden boat negotiated with the Jihe captain, Law Huier, requesting compensation for the loss. The Jihe ship owner first inspected the collision situation and the extent of the damage, and accommodated the wood boat owner's request. He accompanied the owner of the wood transport boat to Shanghai on the Jihe steamer, reported the matter to the Westerners of the company, first repaired the damaged iron railing support columns of the Jihe, and exported as usual this morning, and sent personnel to inspect the damage of the wooden boat and estimate the compensation.</p>
<h3>Recent Banditry and Hail Disasters in Henan</h3>
<p>Report Obtained by the Jisheng Association</p>
<p>The China Jisheng Association recently received a telegram from Zhang Huizhen, Chairman of the Henan Relief Association, and others, stating that five places in Henan Province, including Guangluo and Gushang, have been ravaged by red bandits for a long time, who have committed arson, looting, rape, and murder, and have fled completely, mostly begging at the train stations in Xinyang, with no home to return to, barely surviving and hoping for rescue. Those who fled to Wuhan and Wan Ying and other places have reached tens of thousands, with death and displacement, the situation is extremely tragic. Recently, the Henan bandits were painfully suppressed by the army and fled to the mountainous areas of Song County and Nanzhao, where they burned and killed countless people. They also fled to Nanyang, northeast of the Guanxiang area, and set it on fire, killing thousands of people and looting more than 10,000 people. When the army arrived to disperse them, they attacked Tanghe again, gathered hundreds of babies, broke their brains and bellies, and used them as laughter. Nude women were forced to parade in the streets during the day. The atrocity of burning and killing was several times that of Xiangxi in the past. Fleeing to beg for their lives, they cannot live. Song County reported that on the evenings of May 30 and 31, there was wind and rain, and hailstones fell, as big as chicken eggs, lasting for two hours, accumulating more than a foot thick, extending about 30 li from east to west and 80 li from north to south, and no place was spared. The autumn seedlings were destroyed, and the wheat to be harvested was also seriously injured. Banditry and natural disasters have reached this point. Personnel were sent to investigate and the scene was unbearable. They are in deep water and fire, and are waiting to be rescued. They have repeatedly telegraphed for relief, hoping for rescue, which is a great merit. The heavenly disasters and bandit disasters in Henan Province are expanding day by day. The great catastrophe has reached today and it is really beyond saving. The Nanyang Gongzhen of the association has suspended work because the stonemasons and equipment were all looted by the bandits, but hopes that the ground will be slightly calm before proceeding with the work to complete the century-old water conservancy plan.</p>

<h3>Obvious Adultery in the Shanghai West Assassination Case</h3>
<p>A Male Corpse with Four Knife Wounds</p>
<p>The Penis Was Also Completely Cut Off</p>
<p>At about 8:45 AM yesterday, an anonymous male corpse was suddenly found assassinated in the wilderness near the Xiaoshadu Lime Kiln in Shanghai West. There were a total of four knife wounds all over the body. The strangest thing was that the deceased's penis was also cut off, and the situation was extremely tragic. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Murdered Male Corpse Found: The area behind the Xiaoshadu Lime Kiln in Shanghai West belongs to the jurisdiction of the Fourth and Sixth Districts. It is abnormally desolate. Therefore, there are only a dozen or so thatched sheds built by poor Jiangbei immigrants nearby, and pedestrians rarely visit. At about 8:30 AM yesterday, a murdered male corpse was suddenly found there. When nearby residents saw it, they were shocked and immediately ran to report to the patrolling police of the Fourth District. The police officers reported to the Sixth District Police Station, because the location belongs to the jurisdiction of the Sixth District. Patrol Captain Hu Lizhong reported to the Sixth District Headquarters.</p>
<p>Penis Completely Removed: After receiving the report, District Chief Ren immediately led Patrol Officer Xu Tao and Detective Liu Shaoqing to the scene to inspect it. It was found that the male corpse was about 30 years old, slightly pockmarked, wearing a gray serge long gown, lined with a white silk shirt and pants, and wearing serge round-toed shoes, barefoot and without socks. A small gauze melon-skin cap was discarded beside the corpse, and there were no other items beside it. The head was cut into a hole by a knife. In addition, there was a knife wound on the back of the neck and the left leg, each about an inch deep. What was strange was that the lower penis and testicles were completely removed, and the blood and flesh were blurred, and it was unbearable to look at. However, there were obvious blood stains left on the ground, so they followed the traces until the back of the Fuxin Third Factory in the Fourth District jurisdiction. It is estimated that the distance from the corpse is about 800 meters.</p>
<p>The Court Sends Personnel to Inspect: After District Chief Ren finished the inspection, he immediately ordered his subordinates to arrest the murderer within a limited time, and ordered the local Baojia to report to the local court for inspection. At about 3:00 PM, the court specially appointed Prosecutor Yang Wenjun to bring the clerk to the scene to verify the corpse. It was found that the anonymous male corpse was indeed murdered with a knife before his death. No family members were found, so he ordered the Baojia to report to the court for collection, pending the arrest of the murderer for investigation.</p>
<p>The Content Obviously Involves Adultery: Judging from the above situation, it is speculated that the deceased was neatly dressed, but why were only the two feet bare and wearing shoes? The murderer had already killed the deceased, thinking that the purpose had been achieved, but he must cut off the penis. The content contains adultery, which is obvious. Moreover, the starting point of the blood stains is behind the Fuxin Factory, which proves that the murderer killed the deceased and abandoned the body in a remote place, deliberately making it suspicious. Initially, it was unexpected that there were blood stains left on the way. Therefore, the cracking of this case is only a matter of time.</p>
<h3>Li Hongzhang's Granddaughter Again Asks to Analyze the Inheritance</h3>
<p>Her Husband Requests Cohabitation for Trial</p>
<p>Future Disputes Are Just Beginning</p>
<p>After Jia Zheng, the great-granddaughter of the late Qing Prime Minister Li Hongzhang, married Zhang Jinjiang, she ran away on January 19 this year because of her husband's abuse. Later, she entrusted lawyer Ge Zhaoji to file a complaint with the Special Zone Court, requesting her stepmother to pay her dowry of 12,000 yuan, which was promised in her late father's will. Zhang Jinjiang also petitioned the court to order his wife to cohabit with him. Jia Zheng filed a complaint with the court requesting a divorce. The above disputes have been detailed in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date of trial for Zhang's request to cohabit with Li. Li Jia Zheng arrived at the court at 9:00 AM with her lawyer to wait for the trial, while Zhang entrusted Lawyer Chen to represent him. Lawyer Ge stated that the trial for Li's accusation of Zhang's divorce was on the 18th. It is inconvenient for this case to be tried in two places, and requested that the case be combined. The court approved it. It is also heard that after Li's request for her stepmother to pay the 12,000 yuan promised by her late father's will was not resolved, she has filed a complaint with the court based on the clear giao of women's right to inherit property, requesting Li Jiaxiao and Li Mugong to analyze the property of her late father.</p>
<h3>After Being Released from Prison with No Place to Live, He Chopped His Own Head with a Knife</h3>
<p>Xia Wengao Suffered a Major Nervous Breakdown</p>
<p>His Situation is Pitiable and His Circumstances Are Even More Tragic</p>
<p>Xia Wengao, a native of Yancheng, is 28 years old. He has always lacked a proper occupation and spent his days with low-class people, specializing in using extortion as a means. He considered that extortion and looting would not be a long-term plan, so he changed into a robber last year, specializing in robbing passers-by of their property on the road (commonly known as "killing pigs logically"), but unfortunately he was arrested by the police, sent to the court, found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment, and sent to the Jiangsu Second Prison of Caohejing for execution. Unexpectedly, after Xia entered prison, he suddenly suffered from a nervous illness, spoke incoherently, and acted abnormally. When his sentence expired the day before yesterday, after his release, he thought that he had nowhere to live, he was depressed, and his nervous illness suddenly broke out again. At about 3:00 PM, he rushed to the door of No. 77 Zhangjia Lane, Nanshi, where he lived, and said to Zhou San, a fellow villager who was a rickshaw puller, "My parents and brothers have always lived here with you. Now I want to see my parents." Zhou replied that his parents had moved to other places a long time ago. Xia heard this and left angrily. At about 6:00 AM yesterday, Xia rushed to Zhou's house again, without saying a word, suddenly took the kitchen knife placed on its　 and chopped his head fiercely. In an instant, blood flowed like a waterfall, he fell to the ground in extreme pain. Zhou was shocked to see this and immediately sent him to the hospital for treatment. After the doctor bandaged him, Zhou called the guard Liu Shaoyi from the 14th post and took him to the first sub-station of the first district, where the director conducted a preliminary interrogation. Xia confessed that he was desperate because he thought that his life was hopeless, so he had no choice but to chop his head with a kitchen knife, intending to commit suicide. When questioned, Zhou confessed that he was 41 years old, and that Xia's family had indeed lived in the same house with him before, but later, because of his improper behavior, he was afraid of future involvement, so he moved back to his hometown three years ago. Unexpectedly, Xia came to his house the day before yesterday and asked to stay with him, but because of his bad character, he refused on the spot, and he left, and today he suddenly came to cause this incident of self-chopping with a knife, etc. It was observed that Xia was suffering from a nervous illness and the documents immediately were submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for review.</p>
<h3>Yangxing Town Lingci Association Sealed Up</h3>
<p>Villagers, Men and Women, Greatly Disappointed</p>
<p>Chen and Zhou, local residents in the west market of Yangxing Town, northwest of Wusong, have established a Lingci Association. Although the name is a charitable organization, it enshrines the statue of Jigong in the association and uses divination to determine the direction. Many villagers, men and women, in the town and nearby towns believe in it. Recently, all places have held memorial services for the deceased soldiers and prayer meetings for peace. Therefore, the association also invited more than ten disciples from the Jisheng Association Altar to Yangxing to preside over the Dharma service. A prayer meeting was held the day before yesterday. The association had raised hundreds of yuan from various places in advance, so it was extremely extravagant. The matter was learned by the second directly affiliated district branch of Baoshan County in the town, who believed that the association advocated superstition and seduced the foolish people, and immediately reported it to the Baoshan County Party Department, requesting the county government to order the Public Security Bureau's first sub-bureau on the afternoon of the day before yesterday to send Patrol Officer Liang Yuze to lead the police to seal up the association. At the beginning of spring, the association was chanting sutras with great enthusiasm, so Patrol Officer Liang diligently ordered them to stop the Dharma service and leave the association. The association's house was locked and sealed. The general villagers, men and women, were greatly disappointed. The residents of the town heard the news and rushed to watch, and the road was blocked.</p>
<h3>Heavy Thunderstorm Yesterday</h3>
<p>The weather in this port has been unusually hot in recent days. Pedestrians on the road wave their fans like dancing. People have been enjoying the cool on the roadside in the evening. Steamed water, ice cream, and other cool things have been launched on the market one after another. From 1:00 AM yesterday, thunder rumbled, lightning flashed, and heavy rain poured down, intermittently, until about 8:00 AM, when the Chen rain stopped, but the rain was still continuous. After 12:00, the sun reappeared, and it was as hot as before. However, the low-lying areas in Zhabei, such as Zhongxing Road, the large open space behind the Yong'an Company warehouse, the barren fields on both sides of the northern section of Gonghe New Road, the low fields along the railway in front of the Sun Temple, and the northern side of Pushan Road near the Jiajun Guild Hall, were all flooded because the water could not be discharged in time, and they became a country of ze. Looking from afar, there is no difference from a vast ocean. Qiujiang Road, Zishou Lane, the northern pier of the Hanqiao Traffic Road, Xinhua Lane, and other places were also flooded with water because the ground was low. The doors were all covered with wooden boards, and the water in the shops and in the residents' rooms was up to the knees, and it did not recede until the evening, which seemed to be living in the water all day long.</p>
<h3>Director of the Social Bureau Calls for the Expulsion of Cheng Xun</h3>
<p>Did Not Sign His Name and Submitted it to the Municipal Government for Disposal</p>
<p>Guarding the Dongyue Temple to Avoid Bewildering the Villagers</p>
<p>Hua Dong News reports that in the Jiangwan area recently, Cheng Xun, a villager, has been falsely claiming to be possessed by Liu Zhongxian Gong, and has set up an altar, pretending to be divine power and bewitching the masses. For a time, people from all walks of life in Shanghai believed in him. However, the Municipal Party Department believed that Cheng Xun should not spread rumors to confuse the public, and that such a strange phenomenon should not exist under the party's rule. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting suppression. The Municipal Government approved the order to the Municipal Social Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and the Jiangwan Municipal Committee to investigate thoroughly. The reporter of this newspaper (Hua Dong News) visited Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Social Bureau, yesterday and asked how this matter would be dealt with. Mr. Pan said that Cheng's spreading rumors to confuse the public does need to be suppressed. After the Municipal Government ordered the Social Bureau and the Public Security Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation, they immediately sent personnel to investigate. This report has been completed and has been jointly submitted to the Municipal Government, advocating that Cheng Xun be deported and that the Dongyue Temple be temporarily guarded to avoid the villagers from being bewitched by him. As for the rumors that I have also visited and signed as evidence, this is not true. Although I have visited once, it was to investigate the truth, and I did not sign my name. About two months ago, when the Municipal Government held a meeting of the Construction Committee, Wang Binyan was sitting there. Mr. Wang told me at the time that this strange event had occurred and said that Cheng had agreed to be hired by the Zhabei Charity Group tomorrow afternoon. If the director (referring to Mr. Pan) wanted to visit, he would be responsible for guiding him. I thought it was strange at the time and felt that Cheng's move was really related to the society. Therefore, the next day, he went to see what was going on. The so-called Cheng was not consistent with what Mr. Wang Binyan said. As for his linking the names of the guests and giving books, it can prove his falsehood. When Cheng was writing the couplet, he placed the names of the couplet seekers on his table, and he, Zhang Tiao, were asking for a couplet. Even if the Mayor's initial intention was not to solicit a couplet, he still gave one. This shows that his couplet had been drafted in advance, so he wrote as fast as lightning at the scene. Whether the couplet language is good or not is not stated here, but his secrets can be revealed. At that time, I asked Mr. Wang and others whether Cheng was planning to raise money by giving away couplets. Mr. Wang and others said that there was no such thing, so he smiled and ignored it at the time. Since receiving the order from the Municipal Government, they immediately sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. When Cheng Xun and others were being investigated, they did not say that I had signed my name. The rumors circulating outside were not accurate. As for the famous Lu Nongshi, who announced the inside facts of Cheng Xun to various newspapers and circles, I also received a copy. Although it can break superstition, the Yunyun inside even involves me, fabricating facts, which should not be done.</p>

<h3>Engineering Society's Sightseeing Trip a Great Success</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Engineering Society, since holding a sightseeing trip a month ago, believes that sightseeing is closely related to learning, broadening horizons, and cultivating sentiments. Therefore, it was decided to visit Jiangwan and Caohejing on the 14th. On that day, two specially prepared sightseeing buses, very beautiful and comfortable, and three private cars, each displaying the society's flag, were arranged. The group departed from the society at 8:30 AM. About 40 members, both men and women, and guests attended, led by Zhu Qiqing and Zheng Baocheng. They first went to the Kang Yuan Printing and Can Manufacturing Factory. The factory is normally closed on Sundays, but the factory owner, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, made an exception and hosted the group. The factory's scale is excellent and can be called a model factory. At the request of Mr. Xiang, Mr. Zhu Qiqing, representing the society, inscribed the four characters "Model Factory" as a memento. Next, they went to the China Experimental Chicken Farm, which has thousands of chickens of various breeds, all very beautiful and healthy. It also has a research laboratory that studies chicken-raising techniques, which is a good reference for Chinese chicken farmers and an example of the application of scientific management to small industries. The Shanghai Fuzhi Zhu Milk Company has dairy cows worth US$200,000, which can produce about 100 pounds of milk daily, which is commendable. There are also many other fine breeds. Next, they went to Tang Garden for lunch. Tang Garden is exquisitely constructed and is located about a mile west of the city center. In front of the garden is an 800-acre golf course, where many Western men and women were playing golf. Through the arrangements of the chairman, Mr. Huang Boqiao, they were able to enter and tour the garden. The lunch was specially prepared and brought along, which was very different from dining in the city. After the meal, various games were held. In the two-person three-legged race, Zhi Bingrun and Zheng Baocheng won first place. In the ball-throwing game, Xiang Kangyuan won first place. In the chopstick game, Miss Lin Nuan won first place. Her victory was not accidental, as she was quick to react. Zheng Baocheng, who won the three-legged race with Zhi Bingrun, also won first place in the one-legged race. Yang from the Foreign Affairs Office won a prize in the ball-throwing game. The winners of all the prizes were presented by Mrs. Huang Yan, with each receiving an exquisite prize. The atmosphere was filled with laughter and joy. After the games, photos were taken, and tea, refreshments, and ice cream were served. Then, they passed through the city center, where Mr. Xue Cihua, section chief of the Public Works Bureau, provided detailed guidance and explanations and distributed maps of the city center for reference. They then visited the Tianyuan Electro-Chemical Factory, which is China's first manufacturing plant that combines electricity and chemistry. The factory owner, Mr. Wu Yunzhu, is a self-made man. The equipment is very comprehensive and worthy of learning from. The Caohejing No. 1 Prison is one of the most complete model prisons, paying close attention to the health and operations of the prisoners. They returned to Shanghai in the evening, almost at dusk, nearly 7:00 PM.</p>

<h3>This Year's Loquats are Inferior</h3>
<p>Not Cheap and Not Beautiful</p>
<p>Loquats are a fruit that generates a total sales value of millions of yuan in Shanghai each year. However, due to the severe cold last winter, many of these trees have been frozen to death. Even the few that survived have produced loquats that are far inferior to those of previous years. As they are now on the market, industry insiders say that the loquats come from Dongting Mountain, Chongming, and Tangxi. This year, the goods from the east and west mountains are only enough to supply Suzhou, and even that will be insufficient. What is available in Shanghai is from Chongming and Tangxi. As a result, yesterday's market price was as high as 1.45 yuan per basket (about three catties), and even then, the supply was very limited.</p>
<h3>Nephew's Lawsuit Against Uncle Postponed</h3>
<p>The lawsuit between Bei Runsheng and Zhao Guanqing, et al.</p>

The court hearing was held this afternoon at the French Concession Court. The defendant's lawyer requested a postponement, and the plaintiff's lawyer requested a copy of a receipt issued by Zhao Guanqing to Bei Runsheng in the year Wuchen, which stated, "Received today from Mr. Bei Runsheng, 50,000 yuan, which is being mediated by Xi Yunsheng, Zhou Weishi, and Zhang Lanping as a friendly loan." The case has been rescheduled to next Monday afternoon for continued hearing.</p>
<h3>Abandoned Child Crying by the Riverbank</h3>
<p>Sent to the Public Security Bureau for Investigation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 8:10 AM, a boy of about 13 or 14 years old was seen wandering and crying on the bank of the Suzhou River in Caojiadu, West Shanghai, with a panicked expression. He was spotted by the patrol officer Chen Ruixiang, who brought him back to the 6th District Office. After being questioned by District Chief Ren, the boy stated that his name was Zai Fuxing, that he was a local resident, and that he lived on a boat in the Suzhou River. He said that his parents had died long ago and that this morning his grandmother had instructed him to go ashore to buy matches. Because he returned to the boat a little late, his grandmother beat him severely and then ordered him to go ashore to buy something else and return shortly. He did not expect that the boat had already left without him. He was abandoned there, which is why he was afraid and crying. The boat was carrying flour and had been there for a few days. District Chief Ren, after hearing the boy's statement, felt that it was pitiful that the boy had been abandoned and had nowhere to live. He immediately prepared a document and sent it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation and disposition.</p>
<h3>A Push Into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Fan Maojian Dies</p>
<p>Shang Changfa Detained for Investigation</p>
<p>The cooking helper Fan Maojian, 22 years old, on the boat belonging to barge owners Shen Boquan and Zhang Zhusheng, which was docked at the Wanyu Wharf on the Huangpu River in the South City, and the cooking helper Shang Changfa, only 15 years old, on Zhang's boat, were joking and jumping around on the bow of the boat at 8:00 PM last night. Fan Maojian was pushed into the Huangpu River by Shang Changfa and drowned. Despite attempts to rescue him, he was eventually recovered, but he was already dead. The Water Patrol Team sent police to detain Shang Changfa, who was sent to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau yesterday and then transferred to the Local Court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Bai Wenwei Presents Plaque to Gu Kunrui</h3>
<p>Gu Kunrui, a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine from Chengjiang, has profound medical knowledge and excellent skills. Since opening his practice, he has become well-known in Shanghai. He can cure all kinds of diseases, both male and female, young and old, and he is especially skilled in treating carbuncles. Patients do not have to abstain from meat and can recover completely within a few days. This is his unique secret. Hu, the wife of Bai Wenwei, a revolutionary veteran and prominent figure in the party and government, suffered from aphthous stomatitis and was on the verge of death. Many famous Chinese and Western doctors were consulted, but none were effective. Finally, after being treated by Gu Kunrui, she improved after a few doses and recovered from her serious illness. His medical skills are indeed profound. Bai Wenwei, feeling grateful, personally wrote the four seal characters "Planting Apricots to Form a Forest" on a plaque and sent it to Gu Kunrui on the seventh of last month to express his gratitude and mark the occasion. On that day, the guests were numerous, and the sound of firecrackers and musical instruments filled the air. Gu Kunrui's clinic has been located at No. 82 Hengyu Lane, Qingyun Road, Zhabei. To make it easier for patients in the South City, he has set up a branch clinic at Yu Fenghao in Taihe Lane, Maijia Circle, Simalu, for consultations to benefit patients seeking treatment.</p>
<h3>Jia Jing Engaged</h3>
<p>Jia Botao, former Director of Political Training of the Songhu Garrison Command, after being transferred to Hubei Province, has held various important positions in the party, government, and military.

Miss Jing is the eldest daughter of Jing, who operates Sanxiansheng. She grew up in Shanghai and graduated from McTyeire School. She is generous in appearance, gentle and virtuous in nature, loves music, and is good at socializing. She has worked as a music teacher and in party affairs. It is reported that after Jia's engagement, he will return to Nanjing soon and intends to accompany Commander-in-Chief Chiang to Jiangxi.</p>
<h3>China Film Service Company Established</h3>
<p>Handling Application for Inspection on Behalf of Chinese and Foreign Film Merchants</p>
<p>The National Government, recognizing the significant social impact of films, has ordered the Ministries of Education and Interior to send personnel to jointly form a Film Inspection Committee and has also promulgated the Film Inspection Law and its implementing regulations to supervise Chinese and foreign films. Major figures in the Shanghai film industry, noting the government's efforts to construct social psychology, fear that film merchants may not be familiar with the inspection procedures, which may cause difficulties for the Inspection Committee and make things more complicated for the film merchants. Moreover, since Nanjing and Shanghai are far apart, film merchants must send personnel to escort each film to Nanjing for inspection, which is time-consuming and costly. For foreign films, the title and description must first be translated into Chinese and submitted for approval before being returned for use during screenings. If the translator's translation is inappropriate, it may affect the film's business. Therefore, they have joined forces to organize the China Film Service Company to handle documents, descriptions, and procedures for applying for inspection of Chinese and foreign films to facilitate the implementation of the Inspection Committee and to simplify and reduce costs for film merchants. In addition to hiring talented film translators and editors, transportation experts, and experienced public servants in Shanghai, the company has also established a branch office in the capital to take responsibility for films in Nanjing and handle application matters. Preparations have been underway for several months, but the official announcement has been delayed because the Inspection Committee's orders have not been published. Now that the Ministries of Interior and Education have officially issued orders and mandated that all inspection committees established in various ports be abolished immediately, and that future submissions must be made to Nanjing, the company announces that it will officially begin operations today. Its internal organization is divided into three departments: translation and editing, transportation, and application for inspection. In addition to handling applications for inspection, the company also provides translation, description, subtitle, script, advertising, and other promotional materials for film merchants, as well as domestic and international transportation of Chinese and foreign films. The company's Shanghai head office is located at No. 112 Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Grand Theater Temporarily Closed for Renovation</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Grand Theater in Shanghai, known for its careful consideration of decoration and the selection of films that cater to the social psychology, has attracted a large audience since its opening last spring. Yesterday, the theater suddenly announced that it would be temporarily closed starting today for renovation. It is understood that the theater's opening coincided with the end of spring, and due to weather conditions, some aspects were not as satisfactory or appropriate as desired. Moreover, the humid weather was not suitable for painting. Now that a year has passed, the architect has inspected the building and determined that it is dry and suitable for painting. Therefore, the theater is temporarily closed for renovation to improve its splendor. It is also reported that the theater's air conditioning system, which was installed at a great cost, performed well last year. Now that the weather is hot, its use is imminent. The theater also purchased soundproofing equipment from the United States to prevent noise when the machinery is running. During the renovation period, the theater will also install this equipment so that the air conditioning can be used when performances resume, providing the audience with a comfortable and hygienic temperature.</p>
<h3>Kidnappers in Jintan Allowed to be Transferred</h3>
<p>Qian Maoyou's seven-year-old son, a farmer from Xucun Town in Jintan County, was kidnapped on the Lantern Festival on the 30th day of the first lunar month of this year by Yao Dalai, a farmer from the same town, because his loan request was denied. Yao conspired with Wang Hongzao, Tao Sanbao, et al. from Beijing, who used weapons to kidnap Qian's son to Shanghai. They first hid the child in the homes of Zhang Changgen and a woman named Chen Tao, and then sent a letter to the victim's family demanding ransom, arranging a meeting at the North Railway Station. The incident was detected by detectives and supervisors of the French Concession Police's special agency, Jin Jiulin, Zheng Tanmu Li Yaolong, Fu Tanmu Qian Yumin, Mao Jingen, Zhang Ziying, et al., who arrested Yao and the other four kidnappers and rescued the hostage in Pudong, bringing them to the police station. After questioning by the French Concession Court, they confessed to the crime and were ordered to be detained pending a letter to Jintan County, requesting them to send personnel to escort the prisoners back within a month. As reported previously, yesterday, as the deadline for the interrogation approached, a detective from Jintan County arrived to request extradition for trial. After consultation between Chinese and Western officials, the court ordered that the defendants be handed over to the detective to be taken back for trial.</p>
<h3>Sixty-Year-Old Woman Smuggles Opium</h3>
<p>Xu Gao, a sixty-year-old woman, purchased two large packages of opium, weighing 120 taels, and hid them on her person. She hired a rickshaw and passed through the intersection of Dagu Road and Xizang Road when she was searched by a patrol officer who discovered the opium and took her to the police station. She was sent to the Special District Local Court yesterday. After questioning by Judge Xu, she was sentenced to six months in prison and fined 100 yuan. The number of days spent in detention before the judgment was confirmed will be counted as two days for one day of imprisonment. If she is unable to pay the fine, it will be converted to one day of imprisonment for every two yuan.</p>
<h3>Dandy Cheats for Clothing</h3>
<p>Gao Qingzhen's Empty Joy</p>
<p>Qi He, the son of Li Bingcheng from Guizhou Road Chengzhi, is over twenty years old and extremely frivolous, much like a dandy. His father has repeatedly disciplined him severely, but he has not repented. He was finally expelled from the family and has been wandering outside ever since. Lacking funds to spend, he resorts to swindling. There are quite a few victims. At 6:00 PM last Saturday, Qi He suddenly went to the brothel Gaogingzhen (also known as Lao Liu) at 518 Fuxiang Lane, Guangxi Road, and invited the acquainted prostitute Gaogingzhen (also known as Lao Liu) to go to Lao Jiu Lun silk and satin shop on Nanjing Road to buy clothes, promising to give the prostitute three pieces of clothing. The prostitute happily agreed and selected five or six pieces of various clothing, worth 106 yuan and 8 jiao. Qi He claimed that he did not have any cash on him and asked the shop to send a servant, Huang Jinkui, to take the clothing and go with him to get the money. When they reached the Tongyiyong Gold Shop at the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Xizang Road, Qi He ordered Huang to wait temporarily while he took the items upstairs. He then came downstairs and said to Huang that the price was too high and asked him to call the shop to inquire whether they could offer a discount. Huang went to find a telephone, and by the time he was done, both Qi He and Gaogingzhen had disappeared, and the clothing had also been taken. Realizing that he had been cheated, he quickly returned to the shop to report to the manager, who reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to Gaogingzhen's residence to inquire, but she did not know Qi He's whereabouts either. The next evening, Gaogingzhen received a phone call and learned that he was hiding in Room 150 of the Andong Hotel on Hubei Road. Detectives went with her to arrest him and seized the stolen goods. He was sent to the Special District Local Court for questioning yesterday. The defendant admitted to the crime without hesitation. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu said that he had committed many crimes and still needed to be investigated, requesting a postponement. The court ordered the defendant to be detained pending interrogation.</p>

<h3>Girl Dies Under the Wheels of a Car</h3>
<p>Fei Meiju, a twenty-year-old girl from Ningbo, went out with her mother to play at the Great World on the afternoon of the 14th.

<h3>Enquina Obtains Trademark Rights for Cigars</h3>
<p>"Old Beauty" and "Comet"</p>
<p>The "Old Beauty" and "Comet" cigars exclusively issued by the Belgian company Enquina were confiscated and auctioned by the US government to the Olsen Company in Little Luzon during World War I because they were suspected of being French. The US cigar manufacturer then issued the cigars in various parts of China. After the end of World War I, the auction price was returned, but because the position of the Olsen Company was unaffected, a dispute arose over the issue of trademark exclusivity. The Trademark Bureau re-evaluated the case, and the Ministry of Industry recently made a final decision that all "Old Beauty" and "Comet" trademarks belong exclusively to Enquina. The registration certificate of the US Cigar Company has also been formally revoked.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Labor's Reply to the Guanghua Factory's Letter: Having read the Guanghua Factory's letter attached to the report of the Guanghua Factory labor dispute yesterday in Shen Bao, we were deeply shocked. Upon investigation, the contents of the letter are not only completely unfounded but also simply fabricated facts, confusing the public. In order to clarify the situation of the oppressed workers to the outside world, we make the following painful and sincere rebuttal:</p>
<p>Guanghua Factory has been in operation for ten years. Before He Guyongquan joined the factory, there was never any announcement from the factory about annual losses or intentions to cease operations. He Guyongquan used to be the person in charge of silk weaving, responsible for leading and training workers, without a doubt. If workers were not working hard enough for the factory, they should have been sincerely persuaded to improve. How could it be that only after acquiring the position of factory manager did he claim that the factory was losing money because the workers were not working hard enough? Moreover, He Guyongquan is an uneducated person. Whether he has any experience in factory management is obvious. The factory bought and sold the workers' labor, destroyed the labor union, strictly enforced factory regulations, signed short-term employment contracts, and oppressed the workers. Since He Yongquan entered the factory this February 15, he has recorded hundreds of large and small infractions, dismissing more than seventy workers. What others are unwilling, unable, or dare not to do, he has done, setting a new record for factory managers using tyrannical power. The cause of this labor dispute was that worker Zhu Linhou accidentally splashed medicine on his body while working, fearing that his clothes would be ruined and his skin burned. It seems reasonable to take off his clothes to wash them and there was no reason to dismiss him. After repeated negotiations by the labor union, the factory had agreed to reinstate him. However, He Guyongquan, regardless of the workers' livelihood, obstructs reinstatement, requiring the worker to write a letter of repentance and the labor union to provide a letter of guarantee, stating that if any further incidents occur, large or small, the worker will be immediately dismissed, and the labor union will not be allowed to inquire. This kind of coercion cuts off the workers' lifeline. However, in order to take into account labor-management cooperation and factory management, the labor union prepared a letter to the factory stating that the worker had been reprimanded and would not be allowed to cause similar incidents in the future. The labor union also severely warned the worker before he was reinstated. However, He Guyongquan, on the pretext that the labor union's letter did not meet his requirements, returned the letter and on June 8, again expelled Zhu Linhou from the factory, publicly humiliating him. It is undeniable that He Guyongquan has falsely accused all the workers of assaulting him, causing him injuries, and claiming that the workers broke into his office, overturned tables and chairs, and smashed bowls and plates. As for the issue of workers living in the factory, it was originally the factory's decision to stop supplying raw materials, causing panic among the workers about their livelihood, and the proposal to live in the factory was decided by the entire worker's conference. It was definitely not something that Liu Jintai could dictate. Now the factory is attacking Liu Jintai personally and using this fabricated accusation to alienate loyal comrades in the labor union. When the factory saw that the workers were united and there was no way to take advantage, it demanded that the labor union leaders discuss a solution. Therefore, the labor union accepted the demands of all the workers and discussed a solution together. At that time, police officers Wang Sheng and Er from the Fifth Precinct of the Second District Public Security Bureau mediated nearby. However, the workers believed that Officer Wang was responsible for public security and could not overstep his authority to mediate a labor-management dispute that was unrelated to public security. As for how they were coerced into signing, how they surrounded the general manager, and how they beat Officer Wang, causing him serious injuries, all of these are completely contrary to the facts. Moreover, after the labor dispute occurred, the labor union immediately reported to the competent authorities for handling, and the workers were quiet as usual. However, the factory fabricated rumors and blamed the workers. Even worse, it openly claimed that Officer Wang was beaten, which is an insult to public officials. Now, our association refutes the factory's fabricated facts, recounts the course of the labor dispute, and describes He Guyongquan's oppression of the workers as above. We hope that people in society will understand the truth. Wang Wenhua of the Publishing Industry Labor Union, Lu Muqin of the Pharmaceutical Industry Labor Union.</p>

<h3>Trivial Notes on Commander Xiong's Banquet for Fundraising</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Commander Xiong Tianyi, in order to solicit donations for the Jiangxi disaster relief, made a special trip back to Shanghai before accompanying Chairman Chiang to Jiangxi to suppress the communists. On the evening of the 13th, he hosted a banquet at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to entertain leaders from various industries. The general situation has already been reported in the newspapers the next day. Here, I supplement the details that were not reported by various newspapers.</p>
<p>The public banquet was originally scheduled for 6 PM. I arrived on time. A registration desk was set up next to the stone steps, with Doctor Wang Peiyuan, Secretary Shu Ruifeng, and various staff members from the Red Cross Society Songhu Garrison Headquarters warmly greeting guests to the third floor for refreshments. There were three areas: the Standing Committee Room, the Reception Hall, and the veranda. The weather was unusually hot that day, and the veranda was cooler, so everyone went there. After Commander Xiong arrived, he discussed with Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jingren, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and others in the reception room on the second floor about asking famous Peking opera actors in Shanghai to perform charity shows for a few days to raise relief funds. Shortly after, they entered the banquet hall. The banquet was set up in the Grand Hall, divided into five rows, with five tables in each row, all round tables. The food was provided by Jue Lin Vegetarian Restaurant. When Commander Xiong led the guests into the hall, he was all smiles and frequently nodded in greeting. Du Yuesheng took this opportunity to shake hands with the guests and expressed his apologies for the inadequate hospitality due to the large number of guests attending the completion of his family temple. The table in the center, closest to the north, was the head table. Commander Xiong invited Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, and others to sit at this table. Shi Liangcai, Huang Hanzhi, Wu Yunzhai, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Zheng Chengqing, Wu Zhihao, Lu Qisheng, and others sat at the second table. First, a large basin of steamed buns was served. After the guests ate, Xu Shiying tapped his cup with his chopsticks, and Wang Xiaolai clapped in agreement. Commander Xiong then stood up to report on the Jiangxi disaster situation. This is a pandemic like influenza. If it is not rescued, it may spread to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and then to the entire country. His words were very sincere, and the listeners were moved. Zhang Xiaolin, after hearing Commander Xiong's report that bandits in Jiangxi would kill anyone over thirty years old, those with more than five hundred yuan in property, and those in the intelligentsia, could not help but blurt out that everyone present tonight was qualified to be killed. Everyone gasped. Xu Shiying said that because he was the chairman of the Relief Committee, he had more accurate information about the Jiangxi disaster. Everyone was already saddened to tears after watching the film about the Shaanxi disaster. Little did they know that the Jiangxi disaster was even more severe than the Shaanxi disaster. In one case, there were still people going to investigate the disaster and find ways to provide relief. In the other, people were afraid of being harmed by the communists, and no one dared to pay to bury the exposed corpses and the dying people. Seventy-three counties were desolate everywhere, with no signs of human habitation for dozens of miles. It was too terrible to bear. Donating one yuan could save a life. Saving people is saving oneself. There will be unseen rewards. Yu Qiaqing said that Shanghai has recently been paying attention to and worried about the situation in Guangdong. What people don't know is that Guangdong is not a problem. Jiangxi is a neighboring province to Jiangsu and Zhejiang. If there is no solution, the harm will be far greater than in Guangdong. Please give generously to help. Wen Lanting proposed that those who attended the meeting become fundraising committee members. Then Wu Zhihao, Zheng Chengqing, and others divided into teams, holding donation books and account books, and personally distributed them to each table. Everyone was given a small booklet "A Glimpse of the Jiangxi Disaster," which contained many photos of the destruction caused by the bandits. Many people made donations on the spot, with Zhou Xiangyun and Zhou Chunqing jointly donating five thousand yuan, the largest amount. The banquet ended at 9 PM. I record it with a pen.</p>
<h3>Ballad of the Huai River</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Songfu</p>
<p>Written during an inspection tour of the Huai River in June of the 20th year of the Republic of China, leaving a lasting impression.</p>
<p>The Yangtze is long, the Yellow River is yellow. The Huai River is in the center. From Tongbai in the west to the East China Sea in the east. Mountain torrents erupt, a vast ocean. Drought demons descend, famine everywhere. The old and weak are in the ditches, the strong flee in all directions. Who will devote their efforts to the ditches and canals, so that crops will be abundant and the people prosperous?</p>
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>— Cao Mengyu</p>
<p>The Xiang River has dried up, and tear stains have vanished. Only her beautiful image remains on the wall. Having weathered the storms of the sea of love, the next eighteen stages are still a dangerous shoal.</p>
<p>I know that melancholy is pointless. But it is easy to be enchanted by her clear beauty. I resent the old man under the moon, who ties too many uneven red threads.</p>
<h3>Talking About Wax Beauties</h3>
<p>— Qingmen Hermit</p>
<p>A wax-made beauty head is a kind of artwork. The maker must have a full aesthetic concept of the human body's skeletal and muscular structure, and have the ability to carve and paint with ease, only then can they be competent. The matching of materials also requires a thorough understanding of physics and chemistry. First, the finished product must not be heated and melted in sunlight or under electric lights, so its melting point must be at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Second, the skin color must be as clear as jade, without any oiliness, spots, or blemishes. This point is the most difficult to grasp, because at the time of its birth, it is only roughly modeled, with slight concavities and convexities. It all depends on the knife to cut and shape it to get its appearance. If there are any changes in the cold, warmth, dryness, and humidity of the weather, then its solidification point will be different. Often, it is like alum stone, with the inside and outside having different levels of fineness, unable to be consistent throughout. If flaws are discovered, there is absolutely no way to remedy them, and the work of repairing and shaping is therefore limited. Therefore, those made in Europe and America are priced from hundreds of American dollars to five or six hundred dollars. Generally, they are divided into five grades. The ordinary ones are made of paper and powdered, and the eyebrows and eyes are all painted, worth eighty US dollars. The wax ones are equipped with eyebrows and eyes, but the eyelashes are still painted, and the eyeballs are also made of wax, but the pupils are made of convex glass. The price is already twice as high as the ordinary ones. Most of them have scars on their faces and cannot be looked at closely. They are likened to pheasants under electric lights, which can be said to be an excellent critique. If the skin color is clear, clean, beautiful, and like a person in a painting, then its value is always between three and four times higher. If it looks like alum stone and is fitted with a medical prosthetic eye, it is actually worth 600 US dollars, equivalent to more than 2,000 taels of silver, which is also amazing. The cheapest is the Eastern-style ancient painting beauty, the whole body is only twenty yuan. In the past, only Sang Dongchen was a master of making Chinese ones. Unfortunately, the raw materials he used were not wax, so the eyebrows and eyes were like paintings. Although they were charming, the skin color always felt lifeless. I once sighed that it was perfect but not perfect, and I didn't understand why wax couldn't be used. Only now do I know that wax-making cannot be relied upon, as there are the various difficulties mentioned above, because it is not as self-directed as clay sculpture and paper pasting. However, the clay sculpted heads of Huishan are also worth more than thirty yuan. The heads made by the Buddha statue workshops in the area of the New North Gate are also not cheap. The first shortcoming is that they look like dead faces of clay sculpture and wood carving. I once asked copper statue sculptors why they don't make this. I didn't know that the value of a copper statue is at least four or five thousand gold. The same amount of work is required, so they don't bother with these trivial things. It's no wonder. I often regret that I have never learned to paint, and I can only make wax fruits, but I can't make wax beauty heads. I have been looking for a partner for several years, but I have not been able to find one. Yesterday, I accidentally visited Tian Xuwo at Xiangxuelou, and he was using a knife to make a wax beauty head on a rotating frame. I laughed in surprise, and after inquiring in detail, I learned that it was made by his younger brother Rongxuan. It was shipped from Wuxi to Shanghai and had been damaged, so he was changing it into a thinner face, and the skin was turning clear. The person was like jade, truly perfect. Asking about the price, it was only sixty yuan to one hundred and twenty yuan. The difference in price also depended on the solidification state of the wax. If it was fitted with a full body, then half the price would be added. I praised it endlessly and asked for permission to take a photo as a groundbreaking memorial.</p>
<p>After the photo was taken, everyone who saw it mistook it for the real thing, which shows how skillful it is. There are two photos in total. The first is of Rongxuan's original work, and the second is of Tian Xuwo's modified work. They are displayed at the National Products Mall in the New World and look exactly like twin sisters, with only the difference between the plump Huan and the slender Yan. Some say that Rongxuan's work looks exactly like Xiao Yang Yuelou, and the curly hair is like clouds, all having been electrically ironed, which was made by Miss Xiao Cui.</p>
<p>Publishing News: "Commercial Monthly", edited by Mr. Shi Bohang, professor of National Jiji University, Daxia University, Central University School of Commerce, etc., has now been published for its "Inaugural Issue". The content is rich. There are thirteen articles by Mr. Ma Yinchu, Wang Danru, Liu Zhonglian, etc. In particular, the classified index of major commercial events in the daily newspapers of the past month is a special feature. It is reported that the publication is distributed by Shanghai Ximenwai Anhulu Ruiqingli Commercial Abacus Society. The price is two corners per copy, and the annual subscription is two yuan, three yuan for overseas. There is also a gift.</p>
<h3>Photographs of the Du Ancestral Hall Gathering</h3>
<p>— Qian Hua</p>
<p>The completion ceremony of Mr. Du Yuesheng's ancestral hall in Gaoqiao, Pudong, was celebrated with a grand three-day gathering from June 9th to 11th. Famous performers from both the north and south were invited, including the four great female impersonators, Mei Lanfang, Shang Xiaoyun, Cheng Yanqiu, and Xun Huisheng, as well as Yang Xiaolou, Xi Yunfu, Wang Youchen, Ma Lianliang, Tan Xiaopei and his son, Wang Shaolou, Gao Qingkui, Yan Jupeng, and others, all participating. It can be said to be an unprecedented gathering in Shanghai. The number of guests reached tens of thousands each day. The road to Gaoqiao was filled with a cloud of carriages.</p>
<p>The Glamour of Small Cars　From the Gaoqiao ferry to the Du Ancestral Hall is still a distance of ten li. The community residence prepared dozens of cars and one hundred and fifty rickshaws to pick up and drop off guests, but it was a drop in the bucket and did not solve the problem. Most people still walked back and forth. Those who managed to intercept a few rickshaws along the way were seen as being blessed by good fortune. Although the price was exorbitant, ranging from one to three or four yuan for a one-way trip, people were happy to pay. The countryside's wheelbarrows were therefore in great demand and could not keep up. A one-way trip also cost one yuan. Modernly dressed women sitting on them added a unique scene. Many said it was their first time trying it.</p>
<p>White-Hot Popularity　The theater could accommodate several thousand people, but there were nearly ten thousand spectators, leaving almost no room to stand. Coupled with the hot weather and the low-lying terrain, the surroundings were airtight. Spectators waved their fans while watching the play, and everyone was drenched in sweat. The air in the entire theater was extremely turbid. The phrase "white-hot popularity" is the most appropriate description. Zhang Xiaolin and Wang Xiaolai maintained order, but even they could not disperse the spectators on stage. In the evening, guests continued to arrive one after another. Thousands of people who had traveled more than ten li retreated due to the difficulty. Those who had secured a place in the VIP seats, although enjoying the pleasure of sight and sound, sat through the night, breathing rapidly, with splitting headaches, unable to move their bodies. They were in a situation where they wanted to stop but could not. It was truly an unspeakable pain.</p>
<p>Most Splendid　Among the three-day program, the second day (i.e., the 10th) was the most splendid. The performances included Li Jirui's "Dumu Pass," Little Guiyuan's "Drumming and Scolding Cao," Xu Biyun's "Hua Mulan," Li Wanchun and Lan Yuechun's "The Two Generals," Cheng Yanqiu's "Guan Dayuan Scolding the Palace," Liu Zongyang's "An Tianhui," Wang Shaogen and Hua Huilin's "Sitting in the Palace," Wang Youchen's "Selling the Horse," and Yang Xiaolou and Xue Yanqin's "Changban Slope." The final performance was the complete "Red Mane Stallion" by Mei Lanfang, Shang Xiaoyun, Xun Huisheng, and Xue Yanqin and Ma Lianliang. The arrangement was neat and tidy, a sight to behold.</p>
<p>Brief Reviews of Each Play　Cheng Yanqiu's "Scolding the Palace" has long been famous. That evening, he performed with even more effort. His singing voice was melodious, with ups and downs, winning rounds of applause. Liu Zongyang, the only beloved disciple of Cha Xiaolou, played "An Tianhui," and he did resemble him in some ways. Wang Shaolou's "Sitting in the Palace" featured several major singing sections, all reaching the highest level. The *yuanban* segment of "Flowing Water and the Virtuous Princess" was particularly good. Wang Youchen's "Selling the Horse" was one of the most popular plays that evening. Wang's expression and demeanor closely resembled the late Jiao Tian. His voice was clear and sweet, and his enunciation was solid. The "Innkeeper" segment was met with applause for every line. It was truly a work of pure mastery, transcending the ordinary. Yang Xiaolou's "Changban Slope" is famous among women and children. Paired with Gao Qingkui's Liu Bei, Xue Yanqin's Lady Mi, and Liu Yanting's Zhang Fei, it added to the luster. However, the grabbing of the *pei* in one scene was not clean enough, a minor flaw in an otherwise perfect performance. Finally, the complete "Red Mane Stallion" featured Xu Biyun first singing "Choosing a Mate from the Embroidered Tower," followed by Shang Xiaoyun's "Three Slaps on the Table," Qilin Tong Wang Yunfang's "Leaving the Kiln," Guo Zhongheng and Rongcao's "Chasing the Three Passes," Mei Lanfang, Tan Fuying, and Yan Jupeng singing "Wujiapo" together, Tan Xiaopei and Xue Yanqin's "Calculating the Grain," and Tan Xiaopei, Xun Huisheng, and Jiang Miaoxiang's "Silver Empty Mountain." The finale was Mei Lanfang, Xun Huisheng, Xi Yunfu, and Ma Lianliang's "Grand Ascension to the Throne." The arrangement of this play was neat and tidy, bringing together the four great female impersonators in one performance. From beginning to end, the spirit was consistent. It can not only be described as unprecedented, but also as unparalleled.</p>

<h3>Three Eras (7)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>(3) The Orator of Tianqiao</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaosan'er no longer had his family. Not only did he not feel lonely, but he felt free. Besides his own eating and drinking, he didn't have to worry about anything at home. One day, he pulled two fares and had some money. He didn't run anymore. He turned in his rickshaw early and went to Tianqiao to hang out. Tianqiao was an enlarged department store and playground for the lower classes. It could be said that it had everything one could want. Everywhere were broken reed mat sheds, everywhere was the smell of urine and feces. Naturally, many people were intoxicated there. Zhang Xiaosan'er was also a Tianqiao enthusiast, especially fond of Xiao Ma Wu's Hua Dan in the Bangzi opera. He admired him twenty-four-fold. As soon as he arrived at Tianqiao, he found out that Xiao Ma Wu was singing "Spinning Cotton" today. Excellent! He rushed to the entrance of the reed mat shed stage, but the people inside were surging outwards, saying that there was no room to stand. He squeezed in to take a look. Indeed, there wasn't. He walked out dejectedly, not knowing where to go. He walked aimlessly. He squeezed into the crowds watching Yunli Fei's comic dialogue and the one-man bear performance. Accidentally crossing the street, he saw a small white flag fluttering above the crowd. There was a cluster of people surrounding the flag. Zhang Xiaosan'er thought, maybe it's some new gimmick. Let's go forward and take a look. He squeezed into the crowd and saw two soldiers in gray uniforms standing in the middle. One was holding the flag, and the other had both arms raised, standing there speaking. While he was speaking, many people laughed along with him. Behind the two of them was a large beggar, the one he always saw begging on the street. The other two people were a fifteen or sixteen-year-old child and a forty or fifty-year-old man. Just looking at the white coats they were wearing, without the two half sleeves, and dyed gray-black, they were definitely rickshaw pullers. Those few people were lowering their heads and not saying a word, not as happy as the others listening. The speaking soldier was very unreserved. He gestured while speaking. Seeing Zhang Xiaosan'er come in, he glanced at him and said with a smile, "Here comes another one. I bet he has nothing to do either. You don't have to say that people who have nothing to do, even if they do, are not as happy as being a soldier. After two exercises and three classes a day, we just sleep. Making a living and selling labor all have to worry about where today's meal money will come from. Soldiers don't have to worry about that. We eat when we hear the bugle. We don't buy tickets when we take the streetcar. We don't buy tickets when we take the train. We go wherever we want. If we're not wearing our uniforms, sneaking into the theater to listen to free opera is so embarrassing. When we're wearing our uniforms, we have priority seating. We've seen all the famous actors after listening to opera for a few years, but we haven't spent a single cent. Speaking of going to brothels, haha..."</p>

<p>Financial Gold Price Strongly Rebounds</p>
<p>Letting Go of Swap, Cashing In</p>
<p>Soars Ten Taels and Three Mace</p>
<p>Almost Reaching Its Peak　Yesterday, the 15th, the gold auction rose sharply again, once breaking through the 80 tael mark. The momentum of the rise was truly unexpected, proceeding quickly. The opening was only two or three taels, but the overall market was fourteen or fifteen taels. In the end, it soared by ten taels and some, almost reaching its peak, above 810 taels. However, the exchange rate was slightly higher, so the final price was between 808 taels. The industry had privately opened swaps in advance, initially with the bulls posting a premium of two taels, but there were few transactions. Subsequently, they calculated 1.2 mace to 4.5 mace. Then, the Dalian gang, who were bears, posted a premium of 1.1 to 1.2 mace (these were swapped out by Daxingyong and other bulls). Subsequently, Hengxing (doing the opposite swap), which was originally a bull, deliberately swapped to become a bear, thus posting a premium of one tael. Then it was leveled off, with a total transaction of more than 10,000 contracts. This approach was profitable, so to speak, clever and quick-witted. However, the bears had suffered an infinite impact, thus the July market price has been aroused. Afterwards, the bears were posting a premium of about one tael, which was bewildering. Perhaps there will be some changes in today's (16th) official swap.</p>
<p>No Special Changes in the Early Morning　The July opening slightly increased by 7 mace to 798.5 taels. However, because the big contracts only increased by 1/16 and the silver price did not change, people were unmoved. Subsequently, Yuancheng, Yongyi, Yu, and Wupin sold, which suppressed it to 96.1 taels. Then Yuanchun and Hengyu bought in, so it rose by two taels to 8.2 to 3 mace. The Xianling announcement remained unchanged, at 7.7 mace. Subsequently, the downstream went up by one tael. Due to the sale by Yuanmaoyong and others, it was 96.3 to 4 taels at 10 o'clock. Afterwards, Sumitomo absorbed British March 3125, and various companies slightly purchased, so it increased by more than one tael. However, the market situation was flat, without excessive prosperity or disgrace. Until 11 o'clock, a wave suddenly rose. It was heard that the large bull accounts were unwilling to swap the period, intending to collect cash. Xinheng, Yuda, Cuichang, Yongfuxing, Yongchengfeng, Yongdaxing, Yongyi, Yu Zhifeng, Yongwanxing, Shunli, and speculator Wu and others bravely purchased. All of a sudden, the bears were horrified, and they followed and entered, killing them and scattering them. The price shot up with a burst, suddenly breaking through 800 taels. The British gold was also firm. HSBC offered 25, and then only 1875 could be settled. The market atmosphere was flying high, and the closing price at noon reached 803.9 taels. In the meantime, it only hovered around one tael, but the amount was extremely scarce. The quoted price was still 838.2 taels, a difference of 40 taels to more than 34 taels.</p>
<p>The Later Market Advances Step by Step　The later market opened at 06 taels, then 07 taels. In fact, Wanxing and others had already let go. Subsequently, because the Indian exchange rate reported a large amount of ana, it has returned to 0.45 taels. In addition, Daxingyong, Yuanxing, Yongyuanheng, Tianyu, Yong and others chased and entered. It was also because swaps were privately opened on the table. Initially, the bulls posted a premium, then the opposite was the case, and the changes were very rapid and unexpected. Therefore, it was 09.5 taels at 2:15. After that, there were ups and downs of two taels. It was 06.5 taels at 2:15. However, British gold was flat. Later, Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanchun, and others came in, and people's hearts were even more firm. In an instant, it jumped up by more than four taels. At 3:20, it reached 810.09 taels. Then the British gold bank did 1875 for one another. Afterwards, Qianchangxiang, Zhifeng, Yong and others sold very heavily, so it sharply fell by two or three taels. However, there was only one tael of progress and retreat. British gold sold from 2 wells from 1875 to 25. Until 4:20, it was 07.4 taels. At 4:30, the closing price was 08.1 taels. Afterwards, the posture of standing firm increased by 10.03 taels compared to the end of last week, which was a reversal of the many days of decline. According to the highest point of the day, 810.09 taels, and the lowest point of 796.1 taels, the difference was 10.8 taels. The goods in the afternoon market were 98 taels, the afternoon closing price was 06 taels, and the closing price was 08.2 taels. The quoted price was a difference of 32.3 taels to 27.8 taels, resulting in 30 taels. The registry price was 804 taels, with a water subsidy of 02 taels in the morning and 06 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The Bears Screamed in Distress　Transactions at various companies were more than supply. Due to the swap relationship, the general bears successively covered in, and everyone was screaming in distress. It is estimated that Daxingyong, Cuichangyong, Chengfengyong, Yuanchun, Hengxingyuan, Hengxing, Yifengyong, Fuxingyong, Yuda, Zhifengyong, Yuanxingyong, and Xinheng all took in. Yuancheng, Wanxing, Shunli, Futaiheng, Yuandayong, Fuchang, Hengyu, etc. went out and in. Yuantai, Tongtaichang, and Yuanmaoyong all sold. Qianchangxiang sold the most. Yuancheng Yong and Dadecheng went out and covered in. In the afternoon, Daxingyong, Yuanheng, Shunli, Hongli, Yuanxingyong, Yuda, Xinheng, Cuichangyong, Yuankangxiang, and Fuxingyong all came in. Zhifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Yuantai, Yuhe, Tongtaichang, and Yuanmaoyong all went out. Wanxing, Futaiheng, Yuandayong, Hengyu, Yifengyong, and Dadecheng made frequent entries and exits. The Dalian gang entered more than 2,000 contracts and exited more than 1,000 contracts. Speculator Wu had a considerable amount dragged in. It is said that the Guangdong gang made few purchases.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Flat and Then Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed prices for various exchanges were unchanged. The British bank did not increase, and the American bank did not change, so the Shanghai market was unmoved. The internal disk in the bank was initially flat and then firm. The gold market was flat and then sharp, and the afternoon was calm. Although the gold auction was expensive, it was actually increased by swaps. However, various exchanges were not too tight. Compared with the end of last week, British gold slightly reduced 0.0625, US gold reduced 0.125, and Japanese gold increased by one point. There were no major transactions in the Chinese business gold industry. There were only a few receipts and payments. It is estimated that about 100,000 pounds were transacted in British gold, and the bank still felt it was being sold. About 200,000 yuan was settled in US gold. Hundreds of thousands of yuan were pulled in by the Dalian gang in Japanese gold. Now Dalian is sold by Japanese commercial banks. The market trend is peaceful, but Indian exchanges are long and then shrink. Will the large silver contracts fall back today (16th)?</p>

<p>Securities　20-Roll Future Continued to Stop Rising</p>
<p>Others Also Rose 1 Yuan, Several Corners to 3-4 Yuan</p>
<p>Prosperous Market Conditions with Transactions Exceeding 26 Million</p>
<p>The spot market conditions for each bond future yesterday, only 2 types were made for the spot market: open integer six and disbanding. The future market was particularly tense, and the rise was fierce. In the morning, it jumped up by several yuan. The second board was even more vigorous, resulting in 20-roll June-July contracts and 20-Guan disbanding soldiers and other July contracts all reaching the limit price and stopping the auction. The later market did not start auction until 4 o'clock, so there was only one board market. The trend was more stable than before. As a result, except for the 96 Customs Duty, which only rose by half a point or so, the others continued to rise by 3-4 yuan except for the integer six, which rose by 1 yuan 3-4 corners. The amount of future trading in the morning was more than 17.9 million, and 8 million yuan on the later market board. In addition, spot trading totaled only 3,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Flowers　Yarn Sales Are Becoming More Developed</p>
<p>Customer Sales of 6,025 Bales</p>
<p>The actual demand for cotton yarn is becoming more smooth. The Sichuan gang is purchasing very enthusiastically, and mostly buying local yarn. Therefore, the market price is increasing daily. The political situation news is good, and the gold price is surging again, which strengthens people's confidence. Therefore, the later market can rise. However, most sellers think that the overseas situation is still calm and the sales of coarse yarn are still sluggish, so they are mentally weak and have no intention of buying empty. Therefore, although the current yarn sales are strong, the marked yarn cannot have a great increase in strength. However, if the current sales continue, there will be a great change in the future.</p>
<p>Human Mark Rises 1-2 Outside Taels　The opening of the human mark front market was flat. Each month rose slightly by 2-4 points. In the afternoon, it was heard that current sales were excited, the gold price rose, and the political news was good, so it rose 8-9 points to 1.2-3 taels. The total daily transaction was 17,700 bales. It was found that Xincheng sold 1,650 bales, Dachang 650 bales, Yichang 650 bales, and Dafu 700 bales. Huofeng bought 2,400 bales, Shenji 950 bales, and Yida 600 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>August 1632　12　88,050　November 1609　10　55,500</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Are Very Lively　Current yarn sales are still developing. It was found that each gang bought a total of 6,025 bales of spot and future goods throughout the day, and the prices rose 5 qian to 1-2 taels.

<h3>Cotton Market Calm</h3>
<p>The cotton market was calm, tired in the morning and rising in the afternoon. However, the overseas cotton market was still soft, and people's hearts were not excited. In the afternoon, the gold price surged again, and the yarn market was also good at the same time, so it slightly brought up some rises. However, the market situation was extremely calm, and there was nothing very exciting to say.</p>
<p>Han Mark Slightly Up and Down　The Han Mark front market did not do well with overseas cotton, falling by 5 points to 1 qian. It rose slightly by 1 qian and 5 points in the afternoon. The total daily transaction was 18,100 dans. It was found that Gongtai sold 900 dans and Shenji sold 700 dans. Shenda bought 700 dans, Tianlong bought 700 dans, and Zhenda bought 500 dans.

<h3>Weekly British Indian Cotton Industry Report</h3>
<p>Bombay: Last week, market prices fluctuated with U.S. cotton. While New York market prices showed smaller changes, the hedging variations in Bombay were also small. There were no signs of weakness in the Bombay market. The statistical situation remains solid, with strong current demand. Local factories have purchased a considerable amount of mixed cotton. Transactions by European exporters were quiet. Japanese merchants purchased Oomras and Khandesh cotton in substantial quantities. A significant amount of Oomras and Bengal cotton were shipped to Shanghai. The following is a summary of last week's statistics (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1930		1931</p>
<p>Accumulated receipts since September 1st	3,283		3,112</p>
<p>Weekend inventory		1,258		938</p>
<p>Accumulated exports since September 1st	2,116		2,067</p>
<p>To Europe		726		528</p>
<p>To China		343		343</p>
<p>To Japan		994		1,175</p>
<p>To other regions		53		21</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot transactions were more active last week. In terms of futures, market sentiment gradually improved after new low prices were seen. Market price fluctuations were small, and the weekend was particularly firm. Egyptian cotton moved in response to overseas markets, gradually improving over the weekend following U.S. cotton news.</p>
<p>Grains: Dujian rice is the firmest, while thick japonica rice is stable.</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the rice market was still not fully active due to the slack market conditions in the interior. However, there are still many stocks in the city, making it difficult for the river market to rally. The number of people visiting the market in the morning was still low, mostly inquiring about news. It was difficult to increase sales. Changshu and Northern Japonica rice remained stable, and mid-grade goods moved slightly, so prices rose by one "chi." Thin and early rice still showed no signs of stabilizing. Dujian rice sales were more active, so prices were tight. Lower grades of Yangpu Jian rice showed weakness. Glutinous rice saw no special fluctuations, and Yin Hua rice was also stable. Purchases of Ke Jian rice by local merchants were still weak, and prices remained firm.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, the market sentiment was very good, and the number of visitors to the market was still strong. River transport was acceptable due to the rainy weather and the gradual scarcity of arrivals. It was also heard that the northern market was becoming more active, and market sentiment was trending upwards, suddenly increasing prices. Sales were also thin. With the busy farming season, transportation from production areas was difficult, and market prices suddenly increased. High-quality thick Japonica rice rose by two jiao. Arrivals of thin rice were slightly scarce, but there were about twenty to thirty "hao" of accumulated goods in the river. Ningbo sales were scattered, and local merchants were only picking out the freshest high-quality rice. Mid-grade qualities were still limited, resulting in a price increase of over a jiao. Arrivals and sales of foreign Dujian rice were even, with no market gains or losses. The daily demand for Yin Hua rice was not weak, and the market situation was also tight by perhaps a jiao.</p>
<h3>Distant Month Flour Slightly Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market: After the market opened in the morning, various months initially saw firming market sentiment due to foreign wheat quotations rising by about one or two jiao, appearing slightly better than the previous weekend's closing. However, later, as the sentiment of inland buyers turned weak, sellers gradually became more prevalent, and market sentiment again stepped downwards. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, market sentiment was even more depressed. Although factory sales were not launched on a large scale, the wheat harvest was good, and actual sales in the north were not very active. Because average daily sales in Tianjin were only twenty to thirty thousand bags, about two-thirds less than the peak sales volume, the current weakness is quite in line with the facts. As a result, this month saw no change, while July through November each fell by 1.25 fen.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Market Hovering</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market: After the market opened in the morning and afternoon, various months generally showed a hovering pattern. Because foreign wheat quotations were slightly better, sentiment towards the middle was inevitably stabilized. Moreover, although the new wheat had already entered the market, arrivals were not very strong. Therefore, although the situation had a tendency to decline, the bulls remained stubbornly resisting. Given this state, if the stubborn resistance is excessive, the standard for the future may shift to a sale of more spot goods. At that time, with matched strength, there will surely be a distinction between strong and weak. As a result, this month was up two fen from the previous week, July was unchanged, August was up one fen, September was unchanged, October was down two fen, and November was down one fen. In the spot wheat market, arrivals were more abundant. Since factories still have foreign wheat, they generally take a non-discounted approach to buying. Nanjing wheat opened at 3 liang, 8 qian, and 7 fen; Hezhou wheat opened at 3 liang, 8 qian, and 2 fen; lower grades were at 3 liang, 2 qian, and 7 fen, with a total of 8,404 bags, handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Traders Procure Ke Xian Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian rice market: Although prices did not rise, sales were slightly active. After a pause in the local market, Fuzhou traders suddenly started trying to procure. The night before last, more than 300 bags of Jiangxi Ji Wan rice were procured, priced at 11 yuan and 5 fen to 10 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, another 230 bags were procured, priced at 10 yuan and 8 or 9 jiao. The goods were all ordinary goods from the general market. Although some hoarders purchased high-quality goods and stored them, they were unwilling to lightly sell due to the small margins. There was no change in imports and exports of foreign rice, and no reverse sales were made. This was because the market was very weak, importers were watching, and cargo owners were unwilling to lower prices for sales due to high costs.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Jiangbei Spring Cocoons' Silk Reeling Yields Exceptionally Low</p>
<p>Foreign variety cocoons require over 600 jin... Local variety cocoons require around 800 jin. In Taixian, Taixing, Rugao, Huaiyin, and other areas of Jiangbei, this year's spring silkworms have suffered greatly from the weather. Cocoon production is exceptionally low, amounting to less than three-tenths of a normal year. Due to excessive rain and cold, the cocoons did not produce enough silk, with many thin-skinned and double cocoons. Newly-styled cocoons have been tested for reeling, requiring 340 to 350 jin for baking and threshing. The lowest yield is for local cocoons, requiring around 800 jin (dry cocoons) to reel 100 jin of silk. Foreign variety cocoons also require 620 to 630 jin.</p>
<h3>Yellow Silk Thread Difficult to Improve Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Shanghai foreign-owned silk market still showed no improvement. European and American markets and raw silk factory sales are still slow. Telegrams for white silk thread did not improve yesterday, and yellow silk thread from British and Indian companies also found it difficult to increase sales due to high prices. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and others imported only 25 bales of yellow factory silk, while Meida and others imported 40 bales of yellow coarse silk, with prices remaining stable.</p>
<h3>Lu Zhuang's Zhen Mei Tea Sales in Europe Depressed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi and other areas of Lu Zhuang, with various tea shops putting out no less than two thousand boxes of new styles. There were some scattered transactions for needle tea and Gong Xi teas. Most importantly, for Zhen Mei green tea, except for a few purchases of core-extracted goods by the British company Jardine Matheson, everyone else remained in a wait-and-see attitude. The reason for this is that France still has abundant tea stocks and does not urgently need new goods. The opening prices for Tunxi and Wuyuan Zhen Mei tea last week were too high, causing overseas tea merchants to shy away. However, Chinese merchants were trending towards stability because harvests from various regions were 50% less than last year. Therefore, the whole market did not open for ordinary Zhen Mei tea.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Hunan Lotus Seed Sources Have Been Exhausted</p>
<p>Recently, Hunan lotus seeds have been in exceptionally firm market conditions because of the lack of inventory in production areas. Current prices are as follows: Top-grade Xiangtan lotus seeds sell for 37 to 38 liang, followed by 35 to 36 liang. Changde lotus seeds sell for 33 to 34 liang. Guangdong traders occasionally make purchases, but in small quantities. It is reported that since local goods have been exhausted, the market will be good in the future. Therefore, most people have agreed not to sell cheaply, and further price increases are likely in the future.</p>
<p>Metals: British Steel Plates Being Hoarded</p>
<p>Transactions of British steel plates have recently made good progress, with Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other traders having a few transactions every day, so transactions amount to 600 or 700 dan. However, base goods are not thick. Hoarders, seeing the scarcity of sources and the high set prices, have thoughts of hoarding. An investigation found that 2,000 or 3,000 dan have been purchased, and the prices have been driven up quite a bit. Current market prices are: 2.5 li selling for 9 liang, 8 fen; 7 li selling for 7 liang, 2 qian, 5 fen; 7.5 li selling for 7 liang; 1 fen selling for 6 liang, 5 qian.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand White Sugar Gradually Trending Upwards</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no dispatches from the sugar production areas. The public market was divided outside the market due to higher foreign exchange rates, and sentiment was slightly tight. The transaction price of Dutch No. 24 ordinary coarse sand white sugar and Hong Kong goods was 11 liang, 6 qian, and sellers were not many. High-quality goods were priced at 11 liang, 7 qian, but few inquired. No. 20 medium sand white sugar was at 10 liang and 9 qian, 5 fen, and transactions were also few. The Japanese sugar market also rose slightly, but the trend was relatively flat. Z lai was at 11 liang, 3 qian, 2 fen, 5 li, and TK was at the same price, all old goods. Newly arrived goods were priced at 11 liang, 4 qian, YT was at 11 liang, 3 qian, 5 fen, YRO was at 11 liang, YP was at 11 liang, 7 qian, 1 fen, 2.5 li, AE was at 11 liang, 7 qian, SH was at 11 liang, 1 qian, and TM was at 11 liang, 2 qian, 2 fen, 5 li. The market was still bullish. Hao Pan Zhen Xiang Hao opened with 2,000 bags of spot Hong Kong coarse sand white sugar, priced at 11 liang, 6 qian. Yu Fa and Zhang Tai No. 2 opened with several hundred bags of local factory Binghua Qing, both priced at 10 liang. The original goods opened at 10 liang and 3 qian, and the market was firm. For sellers of Dutch red sugar, No. 8 and 9 goods, Jiecheng foreign company was quite accommodating, priced at 4 yuan and 9 jiao, 5 fen in Dutch currency, and buyers were very few.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Rising Piece Goods</p>
<p>Local Cotton Cloth: Yesterday's market was increasingly firm, with fine cloth in great demand. Blue Chicken has reached 7 liang, 5 qian, and some fen. Yang He Cao Ba Zhang Lan Double Fish all rose by 5 fen. Fine twill Blue Double Fish was suddenly needed by Sichuan traders, with more than 300 pieces transacted, so it suddenly rose by 1 qian. Spot goods of 9-pound coarse cloth are still scarce, and 11-pound cloth is also firm. The sales of Hubei Tianzi Yi Feng have ceased. Yesterday, it sold for 8 liang, 8 qian. Jin San Ta bleached cloth continued to rise to 9 liang, 4 qian. Sales of coarse remnant thread are still slow, so there is no major change. 84 original cloth also rose, with Blue Flying Fish at 6 liang and 1 qian, 5 fen, and Lu Wu at 6 liang and 1 qian.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Piece Goods: All rose sharply, especially Eastern goods. Yesterday, fine yarn rose by 2.5 li. Top-quality Zhigong satin is gradually becoming scarce. Mid-range Sanyou patterns sold out at 3 qian and 5 fen. Six Scholars opened at 3 qian and 6 fen, 5 li, and First Merit at 3 qian and 7 fen, 5 li. Striped Fu Chou rose again after falling, and miscellaneous colors are out of stock. Tu Bai Huxin Ting and Yang Guifei are all at 3 qian and 8 fen. Snowflake yarn, after being procured by Tianjin traders, has gradually become brisk. Yesterday, spot goods were out of stock. Bleached cloth also rose by 1 qian, with Queqiao Hui at 12 liang and 5 qian, Ding Fu Jun at 11 liang and 9 qian, and Fushou Sanxing at 11 liang and 2 qian, 5 fen. Western goods are very difficult to find.</p>
<p>Coal: Two White Coals Suddenly Soared</p>
<p>Mark and Haifeng</p>
<p>Mark white coal and Shaofeng white coal both suddenly soared yesterday, with each ton rising from 19 liang and 5 qian to over 25 liang. An investigation found that this kind of price increase has never happened before. Moreover, the market prices for Hongqi coal and Shanxi coal have not changed. The reason for the sudden price increase is that the white coal comes from French Annam, and now the French exchange rate is high, so the foreign company's prices are expensive. In addition, there have been no arrivals here for more than a month, and the inventory of various merchants is about to run out.</p>

<h3>Municipal Administration Essentials</h3>
<p>— South Gentleman</p>
<p>Written by Bai Dunyong</p>
<p>In today's increasingly complex social situation, in order to ensure that people live in an orderly manner, the government must pay special attention to the municipal administration of large cities. A large city has a considerable population. What is important in city life is a new habit, namely "strict discipline, systematic organization, and proactive work." This new habit should be established first, and then the improvement of municipal administration will be easier to promote.</p>
<p>In ancient times, markets were held at midday, and people exchanged goods for goods. Their daily necessities were obtained in this way. Therefore, the center of economic activity gradually became Chengdu and cities. Mencius said, "When King Tai resided in Qi, those who followed him were as if they were returning to the market." This statement is worth pondering. The Zhou Rituals established the court in front and the market in the back, one as the political center and the other as the economic center. These two were the elements that constituted a city. The "market" in ancient times is what is now called the "market" of municipal administration. Although this is the origin of its evolution, the importance of municipal administration can be seen from this. For thousands of years, there has only been the management of marketplaces and no urban planning, which is an undeniable fact. Until modern times, the government and the people have paid considerable attention to municipal administration. Many monographs on municipal administration have also been published. This book, "Municipal Administration Essentials," is characterized by its consideration of folk customs. Its arguments are based on the national conditions of our country and are worthy of the attention of those who study municipal administration.</p>
<p>The first part, "The Evolution of Municipal Systems in Our Country," and the first chapter, "The Municipal System of the Zhou Dynasty," describe the early beginnings of municipal administration in our country. Emperor Yan Shennong held markets at midday, which was the beginning of municipal administration in our country. By the early Zhou Dynasty, it gradually became prosperous. This is described in detail in the "Market Official" chapters of the Zhou Rituals. However, according to the examination, the greatest purpose of the market at that time was trade. Therefore, the officials and their divisions were also focused on this. Although it is not entirely similar to the current urban situation, at that time, when the framework was roughly established, such as municipal administration organs, police, and social undertakings, all had considerable organization, and the management had a clear system, which can be used as a reference for those who speak about municipal administration in the present era. The situation of the markets and shops at that time was quite impressive. The author tries to list them in diagrams to facilitate the reading of researchers.</p>
<p>The second chapter, "The Municipal System of the Tang Dynasty," examines that after the Three Dynasties in our country, the prosperity of Chinese culture and civilization was best represented by the Tang Dynasty. During the Tang Dynasty, it extended to Europe in the west and to the three islands in the east. Therefore, the municipal system of the medieval era in our country also took the Tang Dynasty as the standard. The municipal administration of the Tang Dynasty can be divided into the capital and the prefectures, states, and counties. The author, in view of this, divides it into two sections to describe it. (1) The organization of municipal administration in the capital. The responsibilities of the municipal administration officials in the Tang Dynasty were divided among four officials. A, the Left and Right Golden Guard, similar to the Golden Guard of the Han Dynasty, the Nine Gates Admiral of the Qing Dynasty, and the former Beijing Police Department. B, the Left and Right Street Envoys, similar to the police stations. C, the Director of the Capital Market Office, was an official in charge of municipal administration, similar to the former Municipal Administration Supervisor. D, the Magistrates of Chang'an and Wannian Counties, similar to the magistrates of Daxing and Wanping Counties in the late Qing Dynasty. As for their management of municipal affairs, each differed according to their different powers. Therefore, the scope and nature were also different. The important matters were roughly divided into seven categories: 1. Matters concerning public safety; 2. Matters concerning social undertakings; 3. Matters concerning sanitation; 4. Matters concerning urban planning; 5. Matters concerning public works; 6. Matters concerning parks; 7. Matters concerning finance. Although the names are different, their duties and the responsibilities of modern management are also similar. Therefore, this research work is necessary for modern research on municipal administration to understand. (2) The organization of municipal administration in the prefectures, states, and counties. This was established because the Tang Dynasty established its capital, and although it was not the seat of the state or county, markets could not be set up. However, if markets were to be set up, there were two restrictions. First, the number of households must be more than three thousand. Second, it must be the location of the state or county government. If the population was not more than three households, and markets were to be set up, there must be special circumstances before they could be submitted to the central government for establishment. As for the scope of municipal administration, it was still the same as the prefecture and state, similar to the capital. From this, we can understand that the scale of municipal administration in the Tang Dynasty can be said to be fully prepared. Its advantages can be divided into three: A. Organized; B. Unified administrative power; C. Uniform regulations for undertakings. However, when it comes to the culture of our country, we must refer to the Three Dynasties when it comes to ancient times, and the Zhou Dynasty was the most prosperous of the Three Dynasties. When it comes to the medieval era, the Tang Dynasty was the model. Although the municipal administration of other dynasties is not without reference, it was undoubtedly dominated by the Zhou and Tang Dynasties. This chapter describes the municipal systems of ancient and medieval times, limited to the Zhou and Tang Dynasties, and is sufficient to be used as a reference for the background of municipal administration, although it is research, it is also used as an aid to polishing jade. Those who study municipal systems in our country today cannot ignore this.</p>
<p>The third chapter, "The Municipal System of the Republic of China," is a detailed discussion of the evolution of modern municipal administration. It first describes the changes in the municipal system of Peiping, then the changes in the municipal system of Guangzhou. After the National Government promulgated the "Special Municipality Organization Law" in July of the seventeenth year, Guangzhou also followed the promulgated regulations and was changed to a special municipality. Its system is detailed in the "Special Municipality Organization Law" at the end of this book. After the establishment of Guangzhou, the atmosphere of municipal administration gradually opened up. After the establishment of the National Government, it was determined to rectify municipal administration. The rise of municipal administration was even more vigorous. Up to now, it is also focusing on the local autonomy of the city. The author compiled a detailed chart comparing the "City Organization Regulations" promulgated by the National Government and the "Guangzhou Municipal Provisional Regulations" to provide a shortcut for those who are interested in the evolution of the municipal system.</p>
<p>The second part is "An Overview of the Police." The first chapter, "The Authority of the Police," states that the police system in our country was created in the Zhou Dynasty, with "field lodges" governing the countryside and "Sibaosi" governing the market, so the law was excellent for maintaining order and tranquility. From the Han and Tang Dynasties to modern times, the ancient meaning has been lost. Those who speak of police affairs have instead taken the legal systems of the West as the standard. After the culture fell behind, it is a pity. In May of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the Legislative Yuan passed the "City Organization Law." The municipal government established four bureaus: 1. Social Bureau, 2. Public Safety Bureau, 3. Finance Bureau, 4. Public Works Bureau. It also stipulates that the municipal government may, with the approval of the higher-level authorities, separately add Education Bureau, Health Bureau, Land Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, and Port Affairs Bureau when necessary. The responsibilities of the Public Safety Bureau are specified as four categories: A. Public safety matters; B. Fire protection matters; C. Public health matters; D. Establishment and banning of hospitals, vegetable markets, slaughterhouses, and public entertainment venues. This is nothing more than "maintaining law and order," which is the duty of the police, and the duty of the police. Since this is clear, the author discusses it in more detail in the second chapter, "The Organization of the Police." The police organization is unified throughout the country, which is now called the Public Safety Bureau, such as the Traffic Police Team, which manages street traffic, the Security Team, which assists the districts and is prepared for dispatch, the Detective Team, which investigates thieves and bandits, and the Fire Brigade, which extinguishes fires. These are all internal organizations of the Public Safety Bureau, so one can know a glimpse of it. The third chapter, "Using People," says, "The key to governance is in obtaining people." The difficulty of police administration lies especially in obtaining people. If the organization is proper, if there are no suitable talents to fill it, it will be difficult to establish a good tree and achieve good results. From the director to the patrolmen, all are part of the police organism. If one part is improper, it affects the whole. Therefore, the use of police personnel is of great importance. Here, the author discusses them separately. In terms of personnel, such as the director, the police, and the patrolmen, such as the bicycle team, the car team, the uniforms, the rations, the women police, and comparing the police systems of various countries, it is a strength of this book.</p>
<p>The third part, "Municipal Administration and Citizens' Entertainment," discusses the modification and celebration of festivals from the perspective of love of liveliness and outlook on life, and has a detailed description of Chinese folk customs, which is the valuable part of this chapter. The end of the chapter contains ten appendices, which are especially useful for the reference of municipal administration researchers.</p>
<p>The current government pays much attention to municipal administration, such as the utilization and preservation of ancient buildings, and the training of various police forces, which are all attracting the attention of the people of the country. The increasing number of municipal administrations cannot be said to be the progress of the past ten years. However, there are very few books and publications on the evolution of municipal administration in our country, as well as laws and regulations. Now, this book by Bai Jun is indeed valuable. However, the first priority in reforming municipal administration today is to create citizens, and to gradually implement citizens' participation in politics, because good citizens can also create good municipal administration. This is the most important thing in reforming municipal administration today. Although Bai Jun's book does not pay attention to this point, it is indeed a special insight to examine the municipal system of ancient times. As for other advantages, I will not list them one by one.</p>
<h3>Critical Essays on European and American Literature</h3>
<p>— South Gentleman</p>
<p>Written by Kushi Shiroishi Village, Translated by Summer Record Banana</p>
<p>With the rise of new culture, European and American literature took the lead in the new literary world. In recent years, Japanese literature has bloomed with strange and exotic flowers, which is worthy of pride in countries with backward cultures. However, their general literary researchers still do not neglect European and American literature, seeking the true essence of its value. The rapid advancement of Japanese new culture has a momentum to surpass the former, which is also due to this reason of not being complacent.</p>
<p>Kushi Shiroishi Village, a strong figure in the Japanese literary world, has a deep impression in the minds of modern Chinese readers. His literary theory books with world value, such as "Symbols of Suffering," "Ten Lectures on Modern Literature," and "Out of the Ivory Tower," have become books that must be read by literary researchers. For example, the book "Ten Lectures on Modern Literature" has made many contributions to European literary trends, because such books are not easy to see in the European literary world. The author uses this kind of historical research perspective to judge European and American literature, which is of course very precise and correct. At the same time, we feel that reading ordinary literary reviews often lacks the purpose of reading because these kinds of specialized works have dry and boring content. Some are just some rigid lecture-style materials. It's like a teacher putting on a stern face in the classroom and lecturing on a rigid book, and the students below are just dozing off, without arousing the enthusiasm of the listeners. Kushi Shiroishi Village's literary monographs, however, break this rigid lecture-style category and completely pay attention to interesting narratives, which is its greatness.</p>
<p>This "Critical Essays on European and American Literature" also has this way, and it is even more interesting, making us feel like reading a beautiful creation, but its characteristics and themes belong to literary theory. The first chapter, "Left Foot Amputation," at first we read it, the impression we got was that it was a beautiful narrative essay. At the beginning of the text, he wrote like this: "At the end of March, I wanted to travel to the other side of the sea, and wanted to move my family to Tokyo. When I was busy with various preparations, I accidentally suffered a slight wound on my left foot, which became the cause, swelling terribly and starting to hurt. The fever was also very high, and I couldn't even walk while enduring it. My own foot, already like an enemy, where is the demon nesting? With further determination, I decided to cut it off. While groaning in bed, I thought to myself, in the past, the great master Deng, because his feet were not complete, could not sit properly during Zen meditation, so he sometimes shouted "This ghost foot," and broke it off stiffly. It healed like this and finally died. What a happy monk! I admired it like this. I have felt interesting since I read this story in some book, and I still remember it. Just this little injury, I can't stand it, I'm ashamed of the great master Deng, I thought like this... Cut off one foot, support two crutches, and be able to barely walk to Tokyo." Although the following is still narrated like a story, it gradually tends to the center of literary theory, such as "Hospital life, it can't become a poem after all, it is a kind of boring and annoying thing, especially a work with a surgical operation like mine as the subject," this still contains a strong interest, but the title of this chapter is "Left Foot Amputation," and at the end, we are told the medicine of this stuffy gourd.</p>
<p>"At first there were four feet, in the middle there were two feet, and finally there were three. What is the thing that is stronger the fewer the number of feet?"</p>
<p>"The readers all know that this is the Sphinx riddle in Greece. Those who can't solve this riddle will lose their lives. King Yipus replied beautifully that it was "man." When an infant, he crawls on four feet, and when he is old, he adds a cane to his two feet to become three. In middle age, he has only two, which is the strongest. But like me, with one foot, I didn't say anything. If you say that the fewer the number of feet, the stronger, one foot must be stronger than ordinary people. This is the stronger one that even the Sphinx's riddle doesn't have. If human beings evolve one step further, one foot is enough. It is named Superman. Really, from the perspective of a Superman like me, ordinary and ordinary people with two feet are very ugly and extremely undignified weaklings."</p>
<p>This kind of literary discussion can be said to be pioneering a new path, and it can be used as a reference for literary researchers to create literary theories, which is indeed an unspeakable fact.</p>
<p>The second chapter, "Literary Scholars and Politicians," is a more important commentator, and it can also be said to be a "critique of life" in literature. The discussion is very insightful and full of national thought. It says that literature will join hands with politics, and indicates a way forward for those who study literature, as said at the end of the chapter,</p>
<p>"In order to build a national life with roots, and to create a national life for politics based on true culturalism and humanism, politicians and literary scholars must approach each other. I believe that the day will soon come when there will be a more meaningful and close relationship between the two parties."</p>
<p>Of course, writing literary works is like a balloon that is difficult to open the ground, which is not very reliable. At the same time, it is not necessary to deal with political and social problems directly in his works. However, for these problems, having a single eye, being able to criticize and understand the preparation, as a critic of life, literary scholars cannot be taken lightly. Regarding this, the author also narrates very clearly in this article. When young people who love literature are wandering on a fork in the road, this kind of discussion containing correct thoughts is really a bright light in the dark night. Moreover, the author makes a serious critique of European and American literature, giving beginners many meaningful common sense in literature.</p>
<p>The third chapter, "New Stars in Irish Literature," is to make a concrete and great view of all the excellent things and matters in the European artistic garden, and to introduce the most excellent new writers of Irish drama to the world, which is even more valuable. For example, the one-act plays, in recent years, the works of Lord Danseni, who has overwhelmed the names of Shazhi and Xinggu, because of its performances, in the American artistic garden, he was initially recognized for his true value. Irish drama has occupied a position in the world literary world, which is described in great detail here, and is a great modern drama theory.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter, "Jack London's Novels," he is now known as a first-class writer in the American literary world, and occupies a unique position in the English novel world. However, few people systematically introduce this writer's novels, such as the famous works "The Call of the Wild" and "White Fang," which write about human stories. The author has precise reviews of these here, and his writing style is like writing a novel, as if we are reading Jack London's novels.</p>
<p>Other such as "Game Theory," "American New Theater Troupe," "Literary Communication," two chapters, (1) English and German Academic Style, (2) Reminiscences of Yizhagalai (J, Echegary), "The Revival of Silent Drama," "European War and Overseas Literature," "American University" and other discussions are all very valuable works. Although the text belongs to the category of commentary, we can also treat it as literary thought and literary theory, and there is nothing wrong with it. In each chapter, it is also full of strong interest, which is very convenient for beginners to read. After this book came out, the kind of rigid lecture-style literary works were broken, and this alone is enough to measure its new value.</p>
<p>Summer Gentleman's translation is very smooth and fits the taste of our country's readers very well.</p>
<h3>Engineering Construction Summary (9)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yanxiang</p>
<p>"The Evolution and Equipment of Dalian Port", Written by Li Shutian, Gao Xiehe, North China Water Conservancy Monthly, Volume 3, Issue 8, August 1930, Pages 1-14, Publisher: North China Water Conservancy Committee, 11 Wuma Road, Italian Concession, Tianjin.</p>
<p>Although Dalian Port is operated by Japan, it is still within the territory of our country. The people of our country must know its equipment situation, and it can also be used as a reference for opening up other ports. The total construction cost of Dalian Port to date has reached 72 million yuan. It was initially leased and operated by Russia. After the Russo-Japanese War, it was operated by the South Manchurian Railway Company since the 33rd year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. The port equipment includes (1) Navigation equipment, such as radio stations, radio compass stations, lighthouses, and fog warning signals, (2) Marine equipment, with wave-breaking dikes on the northeast, west, and three sides, with a total length of 13,136 feet, wharves with a total length of 16,294 feet, and a water depth of 24 to 40 feet. Large ships of 20,000 tons can also berth freely. The wharves are more than 400 feet wide. There are also oil storage tanks and erected iron pipes, a special pier for loading and unloading oil, and a special coal-loading machine for loading coal, (3) 15 transfer barges and ice-breaking barges, (4) Marine transportation equipment, three coal-supplying ships, five marine cranes (one 50 tons), two water-supplying ships, (5) Land equipment, 21 warehouses, ship water supply faucets, each wharf has cranes, a total of 50, mostly electric, from 2 tons to 45 tons, 70 miles of railways, 15 locomotives, 200 freight cars, 58 cars, (6) Auxiliary equipment, a seven-story building for offices, etc., connecting transportation for cars and ships, cold storage, dry dock 440 feet long, and port construction workshops, etc. It can be seen that the construction of a seaport has a myriad of details, its scope is extremely large, and it is not an instant success.</p>

<h3>Performances by the Central Public Theater Society</h3>
<p>— Du Shu</p>
<p>The first public performance of the Central Public Theater Society is now a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Beforehand, everyone anticipated that they would not have a good outcome, because although they had rehearsed several times, they did not seem to have a firm grasp of the script. Furthermore, there had been special accidents among the actors, and they had suffered various setbacks. People who sympathized with and cared about them were worried for them. However, unexpectedly, they achieved final success. In the chaotic situation where the audience filled the entire theater, they were able to maintain order very well, so that everyone held their breath and listened to their testimonies. We can imagine how successful they were.</p>
<p>Their unexpected success made many people happy for them and they received many congratulations.</p>
<p>I would like to record their achievements here, and I hope this record will draw social attention to them. Originally, the school drama movement is still in its nascent stage. That an unopened flower bud can already make people so satisfied shows how much their achievements are worth cherishing.</p>
<p>The play they performed was "Margot," which was adapted and translated from English by playwright Gu Zhongyi. They invited Mr. Gu as the director for this performance. The director understood and appreciated the play, both in its broad strokes and fine details, more than anyone else. Therefore, their success this time was not without reason.</p>
<p>Now let us talk about the story in this play.</p>
<p>Margot is a young and beautiful actress. Her will is very weak, and she often chooses the easiest path in life. She wants to get a lot of money and live a false and extravagant life. On the other hand, she also wants to find someone who truly loves her and be happy. Because of this, she creates this tragedy. In this public performance, the role of Margot was played by Ms. Zhang Zhaohua, a female member of their society. Ms. Zhang is a top student at the school, lively and innocent, and her Mandarin is particularly fluent. However, her personality is not very compatible with Margot's. In advance, the general public felt that she was not very suitable, because it seemed that her expressions could only be used in comedies, and not in tragedies, and her attitude did not seem very similar. However, these were entirely the concerns of ordinary people. In the play, she achieved unimaginable success. From beginning to end, she remained very calm and made the whole play very tense. Her expressions of tenderness and strength were used very cleverly. Moreover, her clear speech made the audience listen intently. In the last few scenes, she seemed to be so excited that she forgot herself. In the sad scenes, she simply moved several soft-hearted female audience members to tears. She was indeed the greatest contributor to the success of this public performance. From now on, she will be even more admired by many young people.</p>
<p>The second character to appear was Bai Senqing, a wealthy businessman who is Margot's lover and her financial provider. They found a most suitable actor, Mr. Ouyang Xin, to play this role. Mr. Ouyang has more stage experience and seems to be closer to drama. With his tall stature and loud voice, he made this role vivid and appropriate. He played the bad behavior of the character in the play, but won the sympathy of the audience. He made people laugh, made people excited, and made people unconsciously nervous and afraid. His performance was rare.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about Margot's lover, the young journalist Ma Ziying. This role was played by the young and energetic Mr. Zhang Liangyi. Mr. Zhang's righteous demeanor was played just right, with no flaws to be found. Mr. Zhang is from Sichuan, and his speech inevitably has a Sichuan accent, so some people were very worried about this beforehand. However, he was different as soon as he stepped on the stage. He unexpectedly satisfied people and unexpectedly succeeded.</p>
<p>There is also Margot's girlfriend, Xiao Chunlan, a woman who is also an actress and has fallen. She is the woman who persuades Margot to return to love and money. She is very flirtatious, a boring woman who wears beautiful clothes and accompanies rich people to watch plays and eat. This role was difficult to find in the Central Public Theater Society, because the female students of the Central Public Theater Society are very conservative. However, in order to make the play successful, a female member, Ms. Zhu Qin, bravely took on the role without hesitation. In the play, she fearlessly displayed her artistic talent. She gave the play another kind of scene. Naturally, she was also successful.</p>
<p>In the middle, Mr. Fan Zhenbang played Qin Jiaotian, an old actor in the play, which was also very rare. His mature, steady, and worldly-wise appearance matched the character's personality. In the two scenes before and after, one sad and one happy, he performed as if he were two different people. We know how cultivated he is in art.</p>
<p>There is also Ms. Wang Hualian, who played the best role of all. In the play, she played Margot's nanny, Gui Ma. Her comical appearance made everyone couldn't help but laugh. However, she, like the movie star Pascale, was not afraid of others laughing so hard that they lost their teeth or their stomachs hurt. She still had an iron face and did her own thing. Someone who does not have a deep understanding and cultivation of drama naturally cannot do this. Therefore, she was naturally valued by ordinary people. Her contribution also made the play very lively, and in the tragic mood, there was a breath of comedy.</p>
<p>All six actors have been mentioned a little. I feel sorry for the brevity of this speech. Fortunately, they are all very hardworking. Let me make up for this shortcoming next time.</p>
<p>They were originally going to go to Nanjing this Saturday for a public performance, but for other reasons, and because the members were scattered due to the school's vacation, they had to cancel the trip. Now they have made up their minds to continue working hard. Probably when school starts next semester, we can hear the news of their second public performance.</p>
<h3>Farewell</h3>
<p>— Jian Qiu</p>
<p>Kui, he is an honest young man, and he is also very knowledgeable. When he was eighteen years old, he was my elementary school classmate. In that year, after graduation, because of the poverty of his family, he could not continue his studies.</p>
<p>One day during the summer vacation, when the sun was embracing the earth, people were panting at home, so the road seemed very quiet. Only two or three rickshaw pullers were running barefoot on the fire-like road, and although sweat was pouring down like rain,</p>
<p>In order to see Kui, I endured the scorching sun and walked quickly on the sidewalk. In a moment, I arrived at his home. At this time, he was sitting silently at the table. He turned his head and forced a bitter smile, saying,</p>
<p>"Oh, Zhao, you came in this hot weather."</p>
<p>"I came to see you specially." I sat on the chair next to his table, and then I asked him, "What school are you planning to prepare for next semester?"</p>
<p>"Oh," he sighed, and a sad expression appeared on his face immediately. After a long time, he told me about his family situation. He said that when he was thirteen years old, his father unfortunately died. At that time, the whole family's life depended on his mother's diligent work for others to do some hard things, which was considered to have maintained the family to this day. In these five years, his mother had suffered all kinds of pain because of him, so her body had become very weak. Therefore, in the next semester, he could not have the hope of rising.</p>
<p>After the farewell, time passed quickly day by day. This semester, I was admitted to Nanjing Middle School, but I often thought of Kui. One day, I was pacing alone in the room. The withered weeds outside the window were rustling in the wind, grieving for autumn. Suddenly, Kui came back to my mind again. Oh, I haven't met him for a long time. Who knew that the next morning, his mother would meet me on the way.</p>
<p>"Auntie, where is Kui?" I asked her.</p>
<p>"Kui went to Hankou to do business last month. Didn't he send you a letter?"</p>
<p>I was stunned, looking at her blankly, as if a heavy stone was pressing on my heart.</p>
<p>"Did he send you a letter?" Only when she asked me for the second time did I realize it.</p>
<p>"He didn't send me a letter."</p>
<p>"Then I will tell you his mailing address." At that time, I took out my diary and pencil from my pocket, copied Kui's address, and then hurriedly said goodbye to his mother.</p>
<p>I took a walk on the street, and then returned home listlessly. I sat down on the chair near the window, and for a moment I felt as if I had received a great stimulus. I remembered that in school, all the teachers and students said that he had talent in literature, and his scores in each subject were above average in every semester. However, because of economic difficulties, he could not go to school as he wished. Ah, his promising future was ruined by life.</p>
