<p>時評和乎　守乎　戰乎　　由於九一八日軍對我東北之暴行所引起之日本與我國間之糾紛。迄今尚在醞釀變化之中。將來究變化至若何地步。此時我人自難早為逆斷。但在此醞釀變化之時期。吾人對於日人外交上之詭秘。與軍事上之準備。則不得不詳為分析。明白體認。以確定應付之方式。尤不得不迴溯甲午清日戰役時之史蹟。綜觀其戰前之準備與戰爭之發動。領取過去之敎訓。以為今日之殷鑒。依據於當前事實之說明。吾人不得不承認日本正在積極準備甲午戰役之重演。而我國則有極多重蹈甲午戰役覆轍之可能性。　　吾人試取甲午戰役先後之史績而重加考查。斯戰之主要背景。自為日本發揮其帝國主義之野心企圖吞併韓國。以實現其大陸政策之第一步計劃但以師出無名。無所藉口。故極力在外交上運用其縱橫捭闔之手段。初則利用浪人內田吉平等。故意在韓煽起　學黨之亂。復槍殺韓政府往東學黨軍議撫之來使。以激成不可收拾之大變。繼復由杉村駐韓代使面晤袁世凱。駐天津荒川領事面晤李鴻章。贊成清庭出兵援韓。及清兵出動。而日本之軍隊隨亦踵至。指清庭蹂躪日韓條約之精神。並云日本未嘗認韓國為中國之屬邦。振振有辭。言之成理。縱橫捭圖，務使雲淡風清之，晴空。由陰雲密佈而來狂風暴雨。彼在外交上旣有可藉之辭。遂悍然不顧一切。愈逼愈緊。終至於演成甲午戰役之慘劇。此即日人所謂外交上處於被動地位之一毒辣政策也。　迨日人準備旣齊。而又默察列强情勢。分別對付。使其中立。然後下作戰之决心。以先發制人之手段開始其攻擊之行動。此又即日人所謂軍事上處於主動地位之優越手段也。　　清庭當時對日無以推斷其挑釁之目的。與有無用兵之决心。對國際無以把握其徘徊觀望之態度。對國內則更無戰守之一貫主張。惟恃一二强國（帝俄）之虛聲聲援。而蒼皇應付。始則一步一步走入日人外交上之陷阱。終乃蹈入迎戰之失敗地位。故喪師辱國。馬關乞盟。使我國在國際上之地位。頓時一落千丈。此種史蹟。則吾人今日所最應認清者也。　　吾人試更取日人今日之行動而加以分析。日人之埀涎我東北大陸。三十年來蓋有如一朝。孜孜經營殺機早蓄所謂滿鐵之被包圍。所謂彼國在我東北權益之被蹂躪。以至萬寶山强關水田事件。挑撥韓人排華事件。中村大尉事件之接踵突發。蓋無非極力挑釁。故意激起我國人之怒憤而走上其圏套。于彼以可以藉口之口實初不料我國人早已燭知其奸謀。竭力忍耐。不與計較。而彼乃遂有誣稱我士兵轟炸南滿路。於九一八突然襲擊我瀋陽之暴行之發生。此種事實。何莫非外交上處於被動地位之一政策之重演。雖其形式有異。而其本質則一也。　　自九一八禍變爆發以來。日人一方面則以極其迅速之軍事行動。佔據我東北各名城險要。並儘最掃除軍事上之障碍。制我於機先而在外交上則亦就各國之利害。而施行其應付之手段。以博取列强之緘默。試觀日人目前之强橫態度。以及即將進攻我錦州之空氣。可知日人已具一戰之决心。此又與甲午戰役中之軍事上處於主動地位之一政策。異其形式而同其本質者也。　日人今日旣已有一戰之决心。并且有戰爭之準備。遼東擊鼓。正動地而來。關外狼烟。匝地漫天。東北之情勢。顧已日趨嚴重。然而反觀我國則如何。　　在九一八之先。我負責當局殆全部信任日方所謂幣原外交。决不疑其有實力發動之舉動。以平時對於日本之國情完全隔膜。故無以窺見其陰謀於機先。而早為之防範。九一八事變旣已發生。警報傳來。蒼皇失措應變無從此與甲午戰役中清庭之昩於知日。漫無準備之情形。蓋不謀而合或且加甚也　九一八事變旣已發生。我負責當局終始持不抵抗主義竭力退讓徒訴之於國際聯盟與非戰公約。徒斥人破壞和平違背公理。實則於各國情勢態度毫無認識。而且際此嚴重時機。分駐各國使節。猶多虛懸徒以施肇基一人周旋於羣强之間。作孤軍之奮鬥。旣不作進一步之活動。復不作退一步之準備。戰守無定。應付無方。議論紛紜。莫衷一是。此又與甲午戰役清庭之蒼皇應戰不謀而合也。　　故默察今日之情勢。日人正一步一步作重演甲午一役之積極準備。而我則正一步一步走向甲午戰役之覆轍。甲午至今歷時已三十餘年。自各方面而觀。仍了無進步。而分崩離析之象。則甚且過之。此則事之至足令人悲憤感痛而末克自己者也。　　據昨日路透電訊。國聯為屈就强權。極力勸我接受組織調查團之决議。其言謂（半塊麪包聊勝於無。）是則國聯尚可恃乎。其他一二强國又可恃乎。古人有謂能戰而後能守。能守而後能和。我國家處此最後之時機。戰乎。守乎。和乎。任何一着。都應有一貫之政策。與事實上之準備。若徒空口誇言。是即誤民與國也。甲午之事。鑒在前車。願我當局與國人。三思而詳考之。接國內要電　　云云、而同時日軍復以步騎砲連合隊及飛機、向我三間房駐軍地前十餘里之湯池烏林諾一帶之騎兵猛攻、我軍民傷亡頗衆、林義秀更聲言、本荘决意非越中東路佔領黑垣不可、（七）十五日本荘以奉日政府訓令、向馬主席提出要求、一、馬軍向齊齊哈爾以北撤退、此次因時局調集齊齊哈爾昂昂溪附近各部隊、歸還原防地、二、馬軍將來完全限制出動東鐵路綫以南、三、洮昂綫由該鐵路運行、馬軍無論如何不得妨害其運行、如受妨害時、日本必立刻實行有效手段、以上條件、十日內必實行、實行後、日軍酌量撤退、并限十六日午前答復云云、同日本荘又派代表白屋、提出要求書、限黑省軍隊即時撤退齊齊哈爾以北、經該省當局復以中日兩方同時撤退、彼不接受、且口頭要求應即宣佈獨立、脫離中國政府、設立維持會、如不認可、日軍仍然攻擊等語、（八）十六日日軍於國聯開會之際、加派大部兵力并唐克車多輛、飛機十架、重砲八門、晝夜猛攻十八日向我全綫總攻擊、以重砲飛機、猛烈壓迫、另有飛機一架、到省垣擲彈、并散放傳單、謂作戰目的、必欲攻進齊齊哈爾等語、現齊齊哈爾已於</p>

<p>自由談玳梁憶語  燕子　　吳大溦在新疆練兵時。所招降之匪合劉某。部下有子弟兵八千人。善用標槍籐牌。兩軍對晏畸。飛擲標槍。發無不中。惟祇　達三四十步。而不能及達。劉某之侄小劉。身軀雄偉。雙手能舉三百斤。烟獅甚深。且異於池人。每日侵晨。必須吸烟二大筒。另燒二烟泡。從榖道塞入。口中之烟吸完。下部之烟泡。亦銷減無踪。過癮後。精神百倍。一躍上馬。頌所部子弟兵。衝鋒陷陣。當者據靡。吳倚若長城。時加獎掖。日人頗憚長之。劉之禦敵也。袒胸執馬刀。奮呼殺敵。狀如中魔。迨日人包抄兩翼。大營潰散。劉領所部扶吳上馬。突圍而出。苦不得地圖。翁綬琪以所得日兵軍帽中之地圖進。乃得以從間道奔入竊內。友人沈君肖均。為吳之甥。亦在營中。為述所見。如劉者亦人傑也。聞鼓聲而思將士。不禁感慨係之。不除庭齋夫談薈新書時代之學生　　舊時代之學生之生長的過程有三個階級··　　一是讀死書··　　二是死讀書··　　三是讀書死··　　新時代之學生也離不了書，所不同的，他是··　　用活書，　　活用書，　　用書活。　　什麼是活書？活書是活的知識之寶庫。花草是活書。樹本是活書。飛禽走獸小蟲微生物是活書。山川湖海，風雲雨雪天體運行者是活書。活的人，活的問題，活的文化，活的成功，活的世界，活的宇宙，活的變化，都是活的知識之寶庫便都是活的書。　　活的書只可以活用而不可死讀。新時代的學生要用活書去生產、用活書去實騐，用活書去建設，用活書去革命，用活書去樹立一個比現在可愛可敬的社會。在活的社會裏，來生都能各得其所，何况這個小小的我當然也是跟着大家一塊兒，欣欣向榮的活起來了。募捐誌感  之範　　溯自倭寇佔我領土以　。迄已兩有有餘。我東北當局。以無抵抗三字不戰而退。轉瞬間喪地數千里。遼吉兩省隨淪於暴日鐵蹄之下。乃家彼倭寇尤以為不足。更進而窺我黑省。省主席馬占山將軍。深明軍人有守土與捍衛國家之責。以一隅之孤軍。於無可奈何之際。與其抵抗。前有强寇。後無援兵。相持兩週。六戰六勝。本巿各大學學生抗日救國聯合會以馬將軍屢創强敵。為我大中華民國爭無上之光榮。乃於十七日代表大會議决十九二十兩日舉行總宣傳總募捐。以所得悉充黑省軍餉。不侫為募捐隊之一人。在此二日中得無限感觸。因拉雜書之於後。今黑軍雖已挫敗。閱者諸君。請勿以明日黃花視之。　　大學生被罵做乞丐　際是國難當頭之時。凡有國家觀念者。莫不奮臂直起。以為國家之後。我大學生犧牲其寶貴之光陰。圖國家之生存。出而為黑省捐欵。其志本已可嘉。乃竟有不肖之徒。見學生沿途攬捐。非但不樂於捐助。且高聲大呼大學生做乞丐等語。聞之令人心肝欲裂。彼不知獨立國家乞丐之生活。高出乎亡國奴不知若干倍。一旦國家滅亡。雖求如乞丐之生活。亦不可得。國人知識之淺。於此可見。但此行之目的。在於向人勸募。不得不忍而耐之也。　　沿途飽嘗閉門羹　募捐隊出發之前。即抱定宗旨。在住宅區先行挨戶勸募。以收集少成多之效。詎料竟大失所望。每至一家。主人翁大都避不見面。而一般無知僕役。不知就裏。非報曰主人不在家。即將雙屏緊閉。而我募捐隊則大嘗其閉門羹矣。　　女小孩愛國可風　赫德路春平坊劉姓家女孩。一鑒於馬將軍忠勇救國。願將私蓄撲滿一個。悉數助捐。共得雙毫銀幣一枚。銅元五六十枚。再主婦捐洋一元。不�侫感於家愛國熱度之高。頻頻向其道謝。主婦則連呼（這是應當的）不置。熱心愛國。可以為風。　　工人愛國不在人下　工人愛國心甚高遠。出乎任何人而上之。雖極貧寒者至少捐小洋二角。有數人合捐一元。甚有獨捐一元者。曾憶一工人曰吾等不能謂之捐欵。但為表示心跡而已。彼等生活如是之苦。而其愛國熱度卻如是之高。較之彼避而不見者。不可同日而語矣。　　兩日中所遇富於愛國心而慷慨解囊者固多。然而避而不見與一毛不拔者亦不在少數。彼見乎劉姓女孩之熱心愛國。與夫工人之樂於捐助者。能無有愧於中乎。從編劇的困難說到（最後之愛）　  省盒　　法國戲劇家冀俄說。劇場中的觀衆。可分四種。第一種是普通觀衆。喜看曲折的故事。熱鬧的情節。第二種是婦女。喜看富於情感的戲劇。最好有一洒淚的機會。第三種是曾經世故的中年人。喜看深刻的箇性描寫。第四種是少數的知識階級。喜推究劇中所包含的意義。編劇的困難。就是不能各方都顧到。往往顧此失彼。所以甲一部分人歡迎的戲劇。未必配乙一部分人的胃口。即使四乙兩部分人都贊成了。却又未必使丙丁兩部分人討好。　　天一公司第二部聲片[最後之愛]。對於上述的四種人。都有相當的滿足。牠的情節。是曲折而熱鬧的。這是合於第一種人。耕莘獄中皆幻想。及出獄後往哭父墓。。小芬追述往事數幕。都富於情感。這是合於第二種人。競芳的浪漫。小芬的眞摯。耕莘的熱情。濟羣的尚義。守裕的苛刻。福堂的誠樸。各人個性。均有深刻的描寫。這是合於第三種人。該片用一個錯綜的故事。包含深長的意義。就是愛情不是金錢可以買得。這是合於第四種人。該片能普遍地顧到各種人的心理。但是並不陳義過高。也不迎合低下趣味。所以能成功為完善的劇本。　　編電影劇本。較編舞臺劇本為難。至於編有聲電影的劇本。則更難。因為聲片劇本。一方面要顧到電影固有的精神。一方面又要顧到演員的對白。倘對白過於冗長。便惹觀衆討厭。過於簡短。又不能表達劇中的意思。[最後之愛]的對白。不過三百餘條。每條最長的。不過四五句。但是劇中的意思。已能表達無遺。這實在是難能可貴。　　有聲電影的劇本。最容易犯的敝病。就是偏重於歌唱方面。致情節簡單鬆懈。有許多觀衆。以為聲片不及默片。原因就是這一層。[最後之愛]雖然也有歌曲。京戲。粵劇。但是因為穿插得當。於情節上只覺得錦上添花。並沒有喧賓奪主之弊。　　編戀愛劇。似易而實難。因為很容易落窠臼。[最後之愛]。寫一個男性經歷三個女性的愛。第一個是求（有挾而求的求）愛。第二個是假愛。第三個是眞愛。牠的佈局很曲折。結構很完密。結尾更是出人意料。和平常愛情劇的方式。絕對不同。　[最後之愛]是蘇怡的原著。由姚蘇鳳改編。復經文藝界諸君討論修正。綫成為一部完美的有聲電影劇本。現聞已攝製完竣。大約不久就可以映吧。悼志摩  葉恭綽　　志摩之變。酸辛累日。聞遺蛻至滬。乃勉為一詩。以述其哀。世變至此。生存本無意義。然不料志摩解脫之速。且其遇甚酷也。塵世無常。生死事大。吾徒宜知所警焉兩儀塞禍殃。萬流同一酷。豈意吾志摩。翻空出奇局。焚身委風火。血肉糜川谷。性命呼吸間。一息不可續。鳴呼星星燄。遂燼昆岡玉。趨死有百途。何辜此塗毒。恨不死沙場。稍雪為奴辱。蓋不死洪水。全歸猶瞑目。天地本不仁。禍福相倚伏。職君一何優。奪之復何速。修短縱有數。景命胡太促。亂世死亦佳。胡效共工觸。（飛機觸山峯以致禍）御風良快意。詎乃趨岱錄。（地近泰山）雲	鵬甘卑飛。何期過郤曲。（飛機以低飛肇事）儀容猶在眼。緘札赫盈櫝。遂已判幽明。往跡無由復。顧增膏蘭感。自處窮雁木。傷逝益自念。萬憾壅胸腹。文囿莽蕭蕭。月色沉南陸。（君於新月雜誌屢有選述）。高名雖永在。殘良恨難贖。殘魂倘歸來。望斷開山麓。（死地名開山）雄壯的文學　（一）　　。  天疣　　現在抗日救國聲中。各地的義勇軍紛紛組織了。但要振作士氣。使他們再接再厲。不至虎頭蛇尾。蹈五分鐘熱度之譏。那種精神敎育。非常要緊。培養勇敢精神的方法。固然很多。而在青年學生中。則文學極為重要。　　以連年的內戰看來。中國是否為愛和平的民族。很難斷定。至於文學作品之中。則幾乎全係和平之音。旣沒有歐洲中世騎士文學的風度。也沒有日本武士道的痕影。這是甚麼緣故呢。因為中國的詩歌是以[溫柔敦厚]為敎。而詞曲則以[緣情綺靡]為宗。那種激昂慷慨豪邁伉爽的作品。不以為[粗獷]。便說他是[別調]了。加以五四運動以來。無政府主義的敎育。流播學校之內。不言廢兵。即說非戰。甚至相信協約國宣傳[公理戰勝强權]一語者。於是學生之所讀。敎員之所講。不是杜甫石壕捉人之吏。便是白居易新慧折臂之翁。那些譏刺用兵。同情避役的作品。在杜白兩氏自有他們的用意。但在提倡勇敢方面言之。總於青年不甚相宜。倘若日讀那種寬柔繾綣的文學。雖此時國難當前似乎悲憤已極。恐不久也如五九。·五三之時一樣。或斂烟消雲散。漠不關心了。　　因此。現在有許多人。也在提倡雄壯的文學（注一）但文學不比貨品。腦筋非同機器。若想定製某種東西而計日程功。那是不容易的。須半靠一時的[烟土披里純]Inspiration。所以今日而言雄壯的文學。一方固賴創作。一方須利用原有的作品。而原有的作品。流傳社會旣久。且容易得一般人的信仰。鄉下人又到上海（二十八）　。  包天笑　　好在鄉下人絮絮叨叨的說了一陣子·廣東堂倌也不知道他在說此什麼？還以為因為漏了一句罵人的話·鄉下人在數說他，便也不敢說什麼了。　　一回兒工夫，菜都送上來了。廣東館子裹的碗碟，都是很考究的，有六角式的；有八角式的；顏色有紅的；有綠的；鄉下人想：這定是全桌的菜上，拆下來的，停刻兒不知要算我多少錢咧，心中只是暗暗呌苦。又見那醬油碟子，胡椒罐兒，都是銀製的，擦得雪白光亮，他想：萬一客吃完了飯，把那種銀器，偷了幾件，藏在口袋裹帶出去，怎麼辦呢？難道可以攔在店門口，把所有吃客一一搜檢嗎？　　菜端上來了：飯也送上來了：鄉下人見了，不覺哈哈大笑。　　[這是我們城裹鄉紳人家，來了縣裹的縣長，或是旅部的旅長，再不然，親家老爺，或是新姑爺上門，泡了那種兩前龍井元泡茶，方用那種蓋碗。怎麼那種廣東飯館裹，把那種泡茶的蓋碗，卻盛了飯來，豈不可笑呢]？　　[難道你們沒有飯碗的嗎？怎麼盛飯也用蓋碗]？他熬不住向那廣東堂倌問了。　　[我們的飯是蒸的。]堂倌如此說。　　[誰說你們的飯是假的呢？自然是眞的]。　　堂倌聽得他責問他們沒有飯碗，便去取了一隻飯碗來，讓他將蓋碗裹的飯，分盛到飯碗裹來。不過那種飯碗磁質甚細，容量甚小。鄉下人見了，有些暗暗好笑。他想：我們在鄉下，毛竹筷，粗公碗，一碗飯，可以抵得那種飯碗七八飯碗，像那種飯碗，祇消兩口，一碗飯就完了。我們做粗事的人，食量比較人家大一點，一口氣至少吃他十七八碗。上海到底都是小氣的人，連那種飯碗也小氣了，別的倒沒有什麼，祇是添飯的人，脚都要跑酸了。　　鄉下人狼吞虎嚼，連湯及菜，如風捲殘雲。廣東堂倌也知道他不是一兩蓋碗飯，可以打得倒他的，一連便送了五六蓋碗上來。依了鄉下人的意思，還有些不夠，實在祇吃了一個半飽。但再要呌他們添，自已覺得有些不好意思，以為　上海來，要擬出一點斯文的樣子，不可遇於粗魯，被那些夥計們，背後罵我一隻[飯桶]。</p>

<p>Mr. Wang Jingwei's arrival in Shanghai this time to discuss unification and jointly resist foreign insults is something that all compatriots across the country are eagerly awaiting, wanting to hear Mr. Wang's views on saving the country. The gramophone department of the China Evening News, recognizing this, specially invited Mr. Wang to give a speech and made it into a gramophone record titled "[Tutelage and Civil Rights]". It explains the meaning of our party's tutelage and the differences between one-party dictatorship in Soviet Russia and Italy in great detail, and provides clear guidance on the development of civil rights. As Mr. Wang's speech neared its end, he solemnly said, "We must know that party rule is to create democratic politics. Understanding this point will give our comrades a direction for their efforts, and our compatriots will also have a direction for their efforts." At this time of national crisis, all of our party departments, public offices, schools, public organizations, and individual families should quickly acquire this record so that they can hear Mr. Wang's instructions and obtain a direction for their efforts to save the country. The record consists of two sides, priced at two yuan per side. It is distributed by the gramophone department of the China Evening News at 480 Nanjing Road, Shanghai.

<p>Yesterday's Banquet with Japanese Vice-Consul Hikaiji and Second Secretary Rikuji</p>
<p>(Harbin) Zhang Jinghui said that the Chamber of Commerce representative and he had initially planned to go to Heihe because Chairman Ma was taking military action against the Japanese army and the situation was dangerous. He had intended to seek a remedy. Now that the matter had passed and could not be mediated, he would not go to Heihe. As for Harbin, as the center of Northeast China, it was important, and the Japanese army would find it difficult to come here. However, in order to maintain order, he negotiated with the Japanese consulate, requesting that the Japanese army not come to Harbin. They telegraphed the military authorities and received a reply stating that since Harbin had not engaged in any hostile acts against the Japanese army, the Japanese army would not come. The current rumor that the Japanese army had entered Harbin had been proven false. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<p>The Japanese Army Transports More Munitions into Tanggu</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yesterday afternoon the 25th, Japanese soldiers went to the Customs Marine Office in Tanggu, claiming that a ship carrying munitions, including shells, would arrive on the 26th. They requested that the verification letter from Commander Kashii be examined and the goods be released immediately. The port director, a Westerner, told them that they were civil officials and needed a letter of proof from the Japanese consul before they could release the goods. Commander Kashii's letter was not valid. The Japanese soldiers said that the consul never interfered with the army's affairs and that Kashii's letter should be valid. The port director refused, and no conclusion was reached. It is unknown how the munitions will be handled when they arrive on the 26th. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>League of Nations Prepares to Shirk Responsibility for the Eastern Provinces Issue</p>
<p>The Secret Meeting Considered the Replies from China and Japan</p>
<p>Because Our Country Insists on a Deadline for Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>There is a Plan to Find an Excuse to Suspend Mediation</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning, the League of Nations Council indicated that if the League of Nations could not mediate the Three Eastern Provinces incident, it would hand it over to the United States, hoping that the US government would handle it according to the Nine-Power Treaty. This afternoon at twelve, the council members (excluding China and Japan) held a secret meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to consider the replies from China and Japan regarding the council's proposal to send an investigation team, then revise the resolution and submit it to the Chinese and Japanese governments for their consent. If there is still no hope of agreement, the council will be forced to adopt a resolution denouncing the principle of military occupation and declaring that the dispute between China and Japan over the Three Eastern Provinces is a special case for which the council has no precedent to follow under Article 11 of its charter and which the League of Nations cannot handle, thereby removing the obstacles to the US government convening a meeting of the signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty. However, some council members still believe that there is room for negotiation in this case and hope that an agreement can be reached in Paris. Today, US Ambassador Dawes refused to discuss the rumor that the US government was planning to reconvene the Washington Conference. If this plan is implemented, the responsibility for considering the heavy task between China and Japan will be transferred from the League of Nations to the United States. However, according to reliable sources within the League of Nations, if the US government agrees to convene a meeting of the signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty, the council is willing to end the current negotiations, adopt a formal resolution, and shelve the Three Eastern Provinces incident without mentioning it. (National Telegram from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning, diplomatic circles here were freely discussing the possibility of the League of Nations Council abandoning mediation of the Three Eastern Provinces incident. It is said that private contacts between the council members yesterday continued until after midnight, but they still failed to produce a ray of hope to break the deadlock. Disappointed, Briand is now suggesting that the council pass a resolution declaring that the dispute between China and Japan is not something that the League of Nations can fairly judge, and then adjourn indefinitely, while shifting the responsibility for the League of Nations' inability to make a fair judgment to China in order to cover up the League of Nations' incompetence. After that, the United States may automatically convene a meeting of the signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty, etc. However, the current situation of the League of Nations is, as the Chicago Tribune published in Paris says, the darkest day in its history, but the future may still contain a threatening effect, hoping to subjugate China by it. It is heard that the League of Nations is currently trying its best to persuade Dr. Shih to persuade the Chinese government to accept the committee's draft resolution without insisting on the four points on troop withdrawal proposed yesterday. Dr. Shih is currently engaged in back-and-forth telegrams with Acting Foreign Minister Gu Weijun. (National Telegram from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is expected that the Chinese government's instructions to Dr. Shih will arrive this afternoon. According to sources from the Chinese delegation, the first telegram sent from Nanjing was slightly garbled, so some sections had to be inquired about by telegram. However, it is generally believed that the delay is actually due to Dr. Shih's request to amend the instructions. If China does not firmly insist on setting a date for the Japanese troop withdrawal, then other counter-proposals will easily become the basis for an agreed-upon plan. It is generally believed that as long as the troop withdrawal becomes a matter of timing, a common plan should not be difficult to find. The Secretary-General of the League of Nations received today the note from the Chinese government to Japan dated November 21, submitted by Dr. Shih. (Reuters Telegram from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Shih Chao-chi has telegraphed Nanjing, suggesting amendments to the counter-proposal he was ordered to submit to the League of Nations Administrative Council. The amendments he suggested are in a more moderate direction. The Chinese government's demand that Japanese troops withdraw from Manchuria within fourteen days has made the League of Nations uneasy because this demand will greatly hinder the success of future negotiations. The Administrative Council is scheduled to meet at 5:00 pm today. It is expected that neither the Chinese nor the Japanese representative will attend, so Dr. Shih is unlikely to submit the final instructions from Nanjing to the League of Nations today. It is heard that Dr. Shih had a long talk with Dawes yesterday, detailing the reasons why the newly appointed Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Gu Weijun, could not accept the current policies set by the Administrative Council. Dr. Shih also described China's concerns today in a very moving way, saying that China's demands were necessary for national self-esteem. If they were not satisfied, there would be an unfortunate reaction, and communism would regain its strength in China due to widespread propaganda from Soviet Russia. (Reuters Telegram from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Japanese delegation said that the Tokyo government's instructions regarding the troop withdrawal clause in the draft resolution of the investigation committee would arrive at any time. Yesterday afternoon and this morning, several members of the Administrative Council privately consulted with the Japanese delegation, urging them to set a date for the troop withdrawal, but they were firmly rejected. (Reuters Telegram from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Japanese delegation today firmly denied the rumor that the Japanese army was preparing to attack Jinzhou, saying that Zhang Xueliang had gathered 100,000 troops near the Great Wall. If the Japanese army were to take the offensive, it would have to prepare extensively. The rumor probably arose because the Japanese army sent a large unit of infantry carrying artillery to the vicinity of Anshan, Qianjinshan, and Nantai to suppress bandits. (Reuters Telegram from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Japanese representative claimed that the Japanese authorities had decided to withdraw one regiment of troops stationed in Qiqihar, and the remaining troops would be withdrawn successively depending on the local situation and the convenience of transportation. (Reuters Telegram from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Chinese government's reply has already arrived in Paris and is currently being translated by the Chinese delegation. According to sources in the League of Nations and newspaper reports, the Chinese government still firmly insists that the Japanese army must immediately and continuously withdraw first. At 10:45 this morning, Dr. Shih visited Dawes again, stating categorically that China refused to accept any compromise until Japan stopped its hostile actions and withdrew its troops. The meeting between Shih and Dawes lasted until 11:15, the longest of all their talks. Afterwards, Dr. Shih told an Associated Press reporter that the negotiations were now entering a critical period, but he remained optimistic that the matter must be settled sooner or later, and China still believed that the League of Nations would handle it fairly. Also, this afternoon at 3:30, Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira also met with Dawes, but the content is unknown. (National Telegram from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, the Chinese delegation received Gu Weijun's counter-proposal, which will be sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Dr. Shih declined to comment on this matter. According to informed sources, China's demand for an immediate troop withdrawal has caused great difficulty for the League of Nations. The Executive Yuan had previously requested an immediate troop withdrawal twice, but it was dropped due to Japan's opposition. Now that the old matter is being brought up again, it is not known whether it will have better results. It is generally hoped that the Chinese counter-proposal will be a basis for consultation and will not be insisted upon without compromise. In the next few days, all parties will seek a way out of this situation. Japan approved yesterday the articles proposed by the investigation committee. It is not known whether the Executive Yuan will approve the amendments proposed this morning. Aizawa assured Briand that the Japanese army would withdraw from Qiqihar and would not use them to attack Jinzhou. Briand will notify Dr. Shih of this matter, but China may not attach importance to this matter since it has already proposed a counter-proposal. The Executive Yuan will discuss the Chinese counter-proposal tomorrow, and the closing date will therefore be postponed. (Havas Telegram from the 24th)</p>
<p>League of Nations' Last Test</p>
<p>In Getting Japan to Accept a Ceasefire</p>
<p>Speech by a British Economist</p>
<p>London. British economist Salter said last night when discussing the trials facing the League of Nations, that the key was a ceasefire. The League of Nations should have an opportunity to express its opinion on this issue. Resolving disputes using peaceful means should not be coerced by force, and the situation will be delayed until the Japanese army withdraws from Manchuria. The League of Nations should not be threatening towards any party, but the League of Nations should use the world's entire moral strength to achieve the key point—that is, a ceasefire. What is at risk now is not only the local dispute between China and Japan, nor only the League of Nations organization, but the entire world, such as the peaceful organizations of the League of Nations Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. (Reuters Telegram from the 24th)</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Refutes Japan's Note</p>
<p>Regarding the Jiangsu Province Incident</p>
<p>Restating the Japanese Army's Brutal Actions</p>
<p>Denouncing its Illegal, Treaty-Breaking, and Untrustworthy Behavior</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Jiangsu Province incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to Japan's note on the 25th as follows: Regarding the Japanese army's military actions in Heilongjiang Province, the government of this country has repeatedly protested seriously and pointed out the major responsibility of the Japanese government in this case. Your Excellency's notes numbered 77 and 78 were duly received and read. The Tao'ang Railway is a Chinese railway, and the right to repair that road is entirely in the hands of China. Japan has no right to advise. This time, the Japanese army demanded the repair of the Nenjiang Bridge, which they had no right to repair, and then dispatched a large number of troops, advancing from the Nenjiang Bridge to Daxing, from Daxing to Tangchi, to Ang'angxi, and finally to Longjiang, escalating the attacks. The most important of the Japanese army's brutal actions in Heilongjiang are restated as follows: (1) On October 24, two Japanese businessmen, Mutsuka and Suki, representing the commander of the Kwantung Army, told Chairman Ma that Zhang Haipeng must come to the province and the Jiangqiao Bridge must be repaired urgently. Du Yixiu, representing the Kwantung Army Headquarters, asked the Heilongjiang provincial authorities to repair the Jiangqiao Bridge within seven days, otherwise the Japanese would send troops to protect the South Manchuria Railway for repairs. After light discussion, it was still decided that the Tao'ang Railway Bureau would repair it itself. (2) On November 2, Lin Yixiu suddenly claimed that the Japanese side would repair the Jiangqiao Bridge regardless of whether the Heilongjiang Province could repair it or not, and that the Japanese army would protect the South Manchuria Railway to send workers to repair it, and also notified Chairman Ma, requesting that the troops be withdrawn ten kilometers from the bridge. At that time, the Chinese army was originally stationed at Daxing Station, 18 li away from Jiangqiao Bridge, which was already beyond the required distance. (3) Early on the morning of November 3, a part of the Japanese army crossed the Jiangqiao Bridge and attacked the Chinese army. On the 4th, they asked us to occupy Daxing Station. After unsuccessful negotiations, the Japanese army changed into Chinese clothing, mixed with bandits, and attacked us, and also dropped bombs on our army's station with airplanes. On the 5th, the Japanese army, together with the rebel Zhang Haipeng's army, attacked the right wing of our Daxing. (4) On the 6th, Lin Yixiu, the representative of the Kwantung Army commander, asked the Heilongjiang provincial authorities to give the chairmanship to Zhang Haipeng, and the Japanese army would stop attacking. When the request was not fulfilled, they added 1,000 new Japanese soldiers and more than 3,000 bandit soldiers, using the latest weapons to attack us fiercely. Seven airplanes bombed everywhere, and dozens of large cannons attacked fiercely. Many of our soldiers and people were killed and injured. (5) On the 8th, Lin Yixiu, the representative of the Kwantung Army Headquarters, formally announced that if Chairman Ma wished to avoid the Japanese army entering Qiqihar, he should surrender quickly and reply before 12 o'clock that night, and also notified Chairman Ma that the only way to avoid war was to step down immediately and hand over power to Zhang Haipeng. (6) On the 12th, Lin Yixiu, representing Honjo, made the following demands to Chairman Ma: 1. Chairman Ma will step down immediately; 2. The Heilongjiang provincial army will withdraw from Qiqihar; 3. Part of the Japanese army, for the safety guarantee of the Tao'ang Line, should advance to the Ang'angxi Station on the Tao'ang Line. He should reply before 12 o'clock that night.</p>

<p>Current Commentary: Peace? Defend? Fight?</p>
<p>The dispute between Japan and our country caused by the Japanese army's atrocities in our Northeast on September 18 is still brewing and changing. It is difficult for us to predict what stage it will develop to in the future. However, during this period of brewing and change, we must carefully analyze and clearly recognize the Japanese's diplomatic conspiracies and military preparations in order to determine how to deal with them. In particular, we must look back at the historical events of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, comprehensively view their pre-war preparations and the launch of the war, and learn from past lessons as a warning for today. Based on the explanation of current facts, we have to admit that Japan is actively preparing for a repeat of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, and our country has a very high possibility of repeating the mistakes of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895.</p>
<p>Let us try to re-examine the historical records before and after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. The main background of this war was Japan's ambition to develop its imperialism and attempt to annex Korea in order to realize the first step of its continental policy plan. However, without a just cause, it tried its best to use its diplomatic means to manipulate the situation. First, it used rogues such as Uchida Kichipei to deliberately incite the Donghak Party Rebellion in Korea, and then shot and killed the envoy sent by the Korean government to the Donghak Party army to appease the rebellion, triggering an unmanageable change. Then, Sugimura, the acting ambassador to Korea, met with Yuan Shikai, and Arakawa, the consul in Tianjin, met with Li Hongzhang, supporting the Qing court's dispatch of troops to aid Korea. As the Qing troops moved out, the Japanese army also followed closely, accusing the Qing court of trampling on the spirit of the Japan-Korea Treaty, and saying that Japan had never recognized Korea as a vassal state of China, speaking eloquently and logically, manipulating the situation to make a cloudless sky clouded and a clear sky turn into a storm. Since they had a justifiable excuse diplomatically, they brazenly ignored everything and became more and more pressing, eventually leading to the tragedy of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. This is the Japanese's so-called poisonous policy of being in a passive position diplomatically.</p>
<p>After the Japanese had completed their preparations, they silently observed the situation of the powers, dealt with them separately, and made them neutral. Then they made the decision to go to war and began their attack with pre-emptive means. This is also the Japanese's superior means of being in an active position militarily.</p>
<p>At that time, the Qing court had no way to deduce Japan's purpose of provocation and whether it was determined to use force. Internationally, it had no way to grasp the attitude of hesitation and observation. Domestically, it had no consistent proposition for war or defense. It only relied on the empty words of support from one or two powerful countries (Imperial Russia) and responded hastily. First, it stepped into the Japanese's diplomatic trap step by step, and finally stepped into the failed position of engaging in war. Therefore, it lost its troops and humiliated the country, and begged for an alliance in the Treaty of Shimonoseki, causing our country's international status to plummet. This kind of historical event is what we should recognize most clearly today.</p>
<p>Let us try to further analyze the Japanese's actions today. The Japanese's coveting of our Northeast continent has been like one day for thirty years. They have been assiduously operating and harboring murderous intentions early on. The so-called encirclement of the South Manchuria Railway and the so-called trampling of their country's rights and interests in our Northeast, as well as the successive outbreaks of the Wanbaoshan water field incident that strengthened the Korean people's anti-Chinese incident and the Nakamura captain incident, were nothing more than attempts to provoke and deliberately arouse the anger of our people and walk into their trap, so that they could have a justifiable excuse. Initially, they did not expect that our people had long known their conspiracy, and tried their best to be patient and not to argue with them. Therefore, they falsely accused our soldiers of bombing the South Manchuria Road and suddenly attacked our Shenyang on September 18. These facts are all a repetition of the policy of being in a passive position diplomatically, although the form is different, the essence is the same.</p>
<p>Since the September 18 disaster broke out, on the one hand, the Japanese have occupied our Northeast's famous cities and strategic points with extremely rapid military actions, and have also done their best to remove military obstacles and control us in advance. On the other hand, they have also implemented their response measures based on the interests of various countries in order to win the silence of the powers. Looking at the Japanese's current arrogant attitude and the atmosphere of their imminent attack on our Jinzhou, we can know that the Japanese have made a decision to go to war. This is also a policy that is different in form but the same in essence as the policy of being in an active position militarily in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895.</p>
<p>The Japanese have now made a decision to go to war and have made war preparations. The drums are beating in Liaodong, and they are coming from the ground. The beacon fire outside the pass is covering the sky. The situation in the Northeast has become increasingly serious. However, what about our country in retrospect?</p>
<p>Before September 18, our responsible authorities almost completely trusted the so-called Shidehara diplomacy of the Japanese side and never suspected that they had the strength to launch an action. Because they were completely isolated from Japan's national conditions at that time, they could not see their conspiracy in advance and take precautions. After the September 18 incident occurred, the alarm came and they were at a loss and unable to respond. This is not in line with the Qing court's ignorance of Japan in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, and the situation of being unprepared is not only in line with each other, but also exacerbated. After the September 18 incident occurred, our responsible authorities have always adhered to the policy of non-resistance, tried their best to retreat, and only appealed to the League of Nations and the non-war treaty. They only accused others of destroying peace and violating public reason. In fact, they had no understanding of the situation and attitude of various countries. Moreover, at this critical moment, most of the envoys stationed in various countries were still vacant, and only Shi Zhaoji was fighting alone among the powers. They neither took further actions nor prepared for further retreat. War and defense were uncertain, and there was no way to respond. Arguments were divergent, and no consensus was reached. This is also in line with the Qing court's hasty response in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. Therefore, silently observing today's situation, the Japanese are taking active preparations step by step to repeat the Battle of Jiawu, while we are taking a step-by-step approach to the Battle of Jiawu's mistakes. More than 30 years have passed since Jiawu, and from all aspects, there has been no progress, and the phenomenon of division and disintegration is even worse. This is something that is extremely sad, painful, and beyond our control.</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Reuters telegram, the League of Nations is trying its best to persuade us to accept the resolution of organizing an investigation team in order to succumb to the strong. Their words say (half a loaf is better than none). Can the League of Nations still be relied on? Can the other one or two powerful countries be relied on? The ancients said that one can defend only after one can fight, and one can make peace only after one can defend. Our country is at this final moment. Fight? Defend? Make peace? Any one move should have a consistent policy and practical preparations. If you only boast empty words, you will mislead the people and the country. The events of the Battle of Jiawu are a lesson from the past. May our authorities and people think carefully and consider them in detail.</p>

<p>Etc., while at the same time, the Japanese army used a joint team of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, as well as airplanes, to fiercely attack our cavalry in the Tangchi Wulinnuo area, more than ten miles away from the Sanjianfang garrison. Many of our soldiers and civilians were killed and injured. Lin Yixiu even claimed that Honjo was determined to occupy Heihe across the Middle East Road. (7) On the 15th, Honjo made a request to Chairman Ma in accordance with the instructions of the Japanese government: 1. Ma's army will withdraw north of Qiqihar, and the various troops gathered near Qiqihar Ang'angxi due to the current situation will return to their original defenses; 2. Ma's army will be completely restricted from moving south of the East Railway Line; 3. The Tao'ang Line will be operated by the railway, and Ma's army must not hinder its operation in any way. If it is hindered, Japan will immediately implement effective measures. The above conditions must be implemented within ten days. After implementation, the Japanese army will withdraw as appropriate, and he must reply before noon on the 16th. At the same time, Honjo also sent a representative, Shiroya, to submit a written request, limiting the Heilongjiang provincial army to immediately withdraw north of Qiqihar. After the provincial authorities replied that China and Japan would withdraw at the same time, he did not accept it and verbally requested that independence be declared immediately, seceding from the Chinese government, and establishing a maintenance association. If it is not approved, the Japanese army will still attack, etc. (8) On the 16th, while the League of Nations was holding a meeting, a large number of troops were added, along with many tanks and ten airplanes, and eight heavy artillery pieces, attacking fiercely day and night. On the 18th, a general attack was launched on our entire line, with heavy artillery and airplanes fiercely suppressing us. Another airplane dropped bombs on the provincial capital and scattered leaflets, saying that the purpose of the battle was to attack Qiqihar. Qiqihar has now been occupied by the Japanese army on the</p>
<p>Page 6</p>
<p>The evening of the 19th. According to reports, after the Japanese army occupied Longjiang, they committed all kinds of atrocities of rape and murder. On one hand, they continued to coerce Chairman Ma's army, and on the other hand, they sent airplanes to counties such as Lindian to drop bombs and injure many people. It seems that the Japanese government is ordering its troops to violate Chinese internal affairs, attack Chinese troops, occupy cities, and bomb residents in Heilongjiang Province, which is a clear violation of (A) the generally recognized principles of international law, (B) the Covenant of the League of Nations, (C) the Washington Nine-Power Treaty of 1922, (D) the resolution of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations, and (E) the solemn statements made repeatedly by the Japanese government. This kind of illegal, treaty-breaking, and untrustworthy behavior of Japan is the same as its actions in Liaoning and Jilin provinces, and the degree is even worse. There is no doubt that the Japanese government is willing to expand its responsibilities. The above sections are known to the world and do not need to be explained one by one by the Chinese government. Even the Japanese government should know that they are facts. However, the Japanese government has repeatedly sent documents to reverse right and wrong. At first, it said that the Tao'ang Railway could be regarded as the property of the South Manchuria Railway and that sending troops to protect and repair the bridge was a legitimate move. Then it said that the troops under Chairman Ma's command were pressing the Japanese army, and the Japanese army had no choice but to eliminate them. Finally, it even said that the Chinese government had not stopped Chairman Ma from resisting the Japanese army and should be held responsible. It also said that the Japanese army had to respond to the war on November 18, as if the Japanese army had never taken positive action before, and the result of the major attack on the 18th, occupying the provincial capital Longjiang, was a necessary response. The Japanese government clearly knows the fallacy and inaccuracy of this kind of argument, but it must deliberately do so in order to deceive the world with false facts and cover up its aggressive actions. However, it does not know that there is still public reason in the world, which can distinguish between right and wrong. Ma Zhanshan, chairman of the Heilongjiang provincial government, has the responsibility to defend the territory. For the illegal and aggressive actions of foreign troops, just like the looting of bandits, he has the responsibility to eliminate them with all his strength. The Chinese government believes that Chairman Ma's command of his troops to resist the Japanese army is a matter of course. The Chinese government has the power to consider the promotion, demotion, reward, and punishment of Chinese officials. The Japanese government is making judgments with diplomatic documents, which is beyond common sense. The Chinese government must demand that the Japanese government severely punish Honjo Shigeru, Lin Yixiu, and all officials who issued orders or failed to stop them. The urgent demand of the Chinese government is still that Japan immediately and completely withdraw all the troops occupying Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Jilin provinces. It should be noted that this note should be referred to Your Excellency, and it is hoped that it will be conveyed to your government.</p>

<p>(Paris) At this meeting of the Administrative Council, the representatives of the small countries spoke a lot and were very important. This morning, the Guatemalan representative, Mr. Mardo, compared the current methods with the decision made by the Hague Tribunal in 1907, and the Administrative Council was greatly moved. In 1905 and 1906, the powers sent naval vessels to demonstrate because Venezuela failed to repay its debts. At that time, Argentine Foreign Minister Drago issued a doctrine prohibiting the use of force as a means of demanding debt repayment. The Hague Tribunal adopted it, calling it the "Drago Doctrine." According to this doctrine, no creditor country may use force to compel the debtor country to repay the debt. Mr. Mardo said that Japan used China's borrowing to build railways, delayed in paying interest, or did not repay the principal as an excuse to protect its military actions, which is a major violation of the Drago Doctrine.

<p>Tokyo is Intentionally Creating a Relaxed Atmosphere</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tokyo is presenting a more optimistic atmosphere this morning. It is generally believed that the situation in Jinzhou can be quieted down and a serious conflict between China and Japan can be avoided because the Japanese government has agreed with the Japanese military authorities not to take independent military action. Even if the situation in Shenyang is tense and the Japanese commander feels it is necessary to attack as a defense, he must first seek the consent of the Tokyo government before attacking. The government and the army have this agreement because they understand that if the Japanese army wants to drive the Chinese army from Jinzhou to within the Shanhaiguan Pass, a dangerous dispute is inevitable. Officials also hope that the League of Nations can persuade the Chinese army to withdraw from Jinzhou voluntarily. Although the Japanese government is not asking the League of Nations to do so, it has telegraphed Aizawa to emphasize the danger of the current situation. It was heard tonight that the Japanese government has instructed Aizawa to accept the League of Nations' entire proposal regarding the investigation team, but with the reservation that the following should be added to Article 2 of the proposal (Military plans necessary for the protection of the lives and property of Japanese people, for the purpose of resisting bandits, and for other lawless elements are not subject to this provision). The Japanese government also has suggestions for slightly revising the wording of the proposal. (Reuters Telegram from the 25th)</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Colludes with White Russians</p>
<p>Instigating a Military Occupation of the China Eastern Railway</p>
<p>Preparing for a Future Japanese-Russian War</p>
<p>(Moscow) It has recently been reported from reliable sources in Beiping that the Japanese military authorities in northern Manchuria have concluded a treaty with the White Russian troops on the Russian border. This news has been announced by various newspapers here. According to the news, the conclusion of the treaty was facilitated by a Japanese officer stationed in Harbin named Ozawa. The appointment assumed by the White Russians is to forcibly occupy the China Eastern Railway line. Now that Ozawa has completed this task, he has returned to Shenyang to report everything to the Japanese military authorities. According to the plan, the White Russians should occupy the Harbin station with a team of White Russian troops, cutting off traffic on the entire line. Then, they should occupy the storage place with a regiment and confiscate all locomotives and vehicles. Then, the third regiment should occupy the General Bureau and the China Eastern Railway Printing Bureau. Then, the personnel of the entire line's telecommunications bureau must be replaced. A portion of the personnel has now been recruited for deployment. The above report is said to have come from extremely reliable sources. Although this matter is difficult to verify for the time being, the Japanese officials in Harbin have clearly stated that Harbin will soon be under Japanese occupation. Furthermore, the Japanese authorities in Harbin openly stated that in order to prepare for a future Japanese-Russian war, they should do their best to encourage the White Russians to cause a fierce riot. Only in this way can the strength of the White Russian elements be tested. A certain Japanese officer in Harbin also told General Kosni, the leader of the White Russians, that although a Japanese-Russian war may not become a reality, Japan has decided to establish a buffer state in Manchuria, so the White Russians' mission thereafter is extremely important.

<p>The local council officially denies any intention of initiating an attack on Jinzhou; however, foreign military experts here believe that hostilities are likely to break out before the end of this week. The Japanese plan to attack Jinzhou remains a secret, but it is believed they will advance in two directions: one along the Beining Railway, and the other westward from a point between the Mukden (Shenyang) and Dalian stations on the South Manchuria Railway. Their starting point is expected to be near Sunyang. These two Japanese forces will clear out any scattered Chinese troops along the way before converging to attack Jinzhou. It is also anticipated that the Japanese will dispatch a unit to land at Qinhuangdao, with the aim of advancing to the vicinity of Shanhaiguan to cut off traffic on the Beining Railway and prevent Chinese troops from reinforcing Jinzhou. The military attachés of five countries stationed in Japan—Lieutenant Colonel Leclaire of the United States, Colonel Lachiewicz of Poland, Major Blancpain of France, Lieutenant Colonel Newson of Great Britain, and Major Berro of Argentina—accompanied by Major Koyama of the Japanese General Staff, arrived in Mukden this afternoon. The Japanese government invited the five attachés to inspect the remnants of the battle at Qiqihar. According to Japanese plans, they are scheduled to depart for Qiqihar on Thursday morning. However, it is reported that the Polish attaché, in light of the imminent military action in the Jinzhou area, has expressed his desire to remain in Mukden for several days, believing that it is absurd for military observers to travel to Qiqihar when a more turbulent situation is developing in Jinzhou.</p>

<p>Harbin Special Dispatch: Driven by its long-standing ambition to annex the Three Eastern Provinces, the brutal Japanese, using the pretext that China intended to demolish the South Manchuria Railway, launched an unprovoked attack on the night of September 18th. Liaoning fell due to non-resistance, and Jilin was lost due to the perfidy of Xi Qia. The Japanese then sought to complete their plan of establishing a new regime, instigating Zhang Haipeng to plot against Heilongjiang Province, with a Japanese brigade as his backing. At the time, Wan Guobin, the son of Wan Fulin, the former chairman of Heilongjiang Province, was in sole control of the provincial government. He seized the opportunity to amass public and private funds, buying up gold certificates in preparation for living abroad as a wealthy exile. He even had local gentry welcome Zhang in Taonan. Ma Zhanshan, who was en route to the province, upon hearing the news, pressed forward with all speed. Three days before his arrival, Zhang Haipeng's rebel forces were defeated by the reclamation troops, and Heilongjiang Province was fortunately not lost. Upon Ma's arrival in the province, he immediately convened a military conference to devise a defense strategy. Those present, all civil officials, pleaded with Ma to consider the depleted treasury and the lack of adequate weaponry, and to welcome Zhang Haipeng to ensure the preservation of the region. Provincial Committee member Zhao Zhongren was particularly forceful in advocating this course. Ma slammed the table and declared, "I am appointed as the chairman of this province and have a duty to defend the territory. I cannot become a general who surrenders. Furthermore, I come from a bandit background and hold a high position. I would not hesitate to sacrifice my life." Xu Jun, the commander of the guard regiment (whose name I have unfortunately forgotten), also raised his gun and exclaimed, "Any of you present who dare to speak of surrender, please die!" The decision to resist was thus made. Since November 4th, there has not been a day without fighting. With fewer than 10,000 soldiers, amidst severe wind and snow, lacking both reinforcements and supplies, and with weaponry that is the least sophisticated of the three provinces, they have fought valiantly. Not only do they lack aircraft, tanks, and anti-aircraft guns, but even the dozen or so field guns, thirty or so mortars, and the rifles used by the soldiers are not of high quality. As for the enemy's weaponry, the completeness and excellence of the Japanese equipment go without saying. Even Zhang Haipeng's troops were equipped with all-new, modern weaponry supplied by the Japanese (rumored to have been taken from the Mukden Arsenal). In our imagination, this should have been insufficient to withstand even a single blow from the enemy. However, before November 8th, the Heilongjiang army crushed Zhang Haipeng's forces of over 10,000 men like withered weeds, completely resolving and expelling them. Even the Japanese troops behind Zhang's army suffered over 600 casualties. Since then, the enemy has been exclusively Japanese, and their numbers exceed 10,000. Each attack involves several thousand troops, but our army has been victorious in every battle. In the past two days, we even captured several cannons and machine guns, killing over a hundred enemies. One unit, numbering about 600, was trapped by our forces in earthen houses for over ten hours before managing to break out. The situation of their courageous killing of the enemy is entirely beyond our expectations. From the generals to the soldiers, all are filled with the determination to die, so they are able to face powerful enemies without any fear. Since November 9th, when I met with the first delegation from Harbin to慰勞 the soldiers at the front lines, I have inquired about the situation of the officers and soldiers in battle. Afterward, whenever I encountered acquaintances from Angangxi or those returning from慰勞 the soldiers, I would invariably ask about this. Now I will present the similarities and differences in their accounts, so that the people of the nation will know the past achievements of the Heilongjiang army. Even though they have recently been defeated due to exhaustion of ammunition and lack of reinforcements, their deeds are worthy of immortalization. Furthermore, if the military of the entire nation could emulate the Heilongjiang army, the Japanese, however strong, would surely find it difficult to achieve their ambitions.</p>
<p>(1) The reclamation troops were originally artillery units of the Feng army led by Zou Zuohua, stationed in the Taonan area of Fengtian and the Solun area of Heilongjiang. When Zhang Haipeng first plotted against Heilongjiang in the middle of last month, Yuan Chonggu, the brigade commander of the reclamation troops, defeated Zhang Haipeng's army on the west bank of the Nen River in Tailai. After Ma Zhanshan took office on the 21st of last month, he transferred Yuan to deploy on the east bank of the Nen River Bridge. Due to the lack of ships and ammunition for all the artillery, the soldiers would rather sacrifice their lives than sacrifice the shells, carrying the shells on their heads and wading across the river naked. The water reached their shoulders, and the ice was bone-chilling, causing the death of over a hundred soldiers. (Readers should not ask why the soldiers did not use boats. It must be known that there are very few boats in Jiang Province. In the summer, there may be three or five boats to be seen on the Chaer River and Nen River, but in autumn and winter, there are no boats to be found. If they had to wait for boats before crossing, it would take months. Therefore, the soldiers had to carry the cannons on boats and wade across naked, which was inevitable.) Currently, all the artillery troops in Heilongjiang Province belong to Yuan's brigade, using field guns instead of anti-aircraft guns. Each gun is manned by eight people, digging trenches to position the guns, exposing only the muzzle. When aircraft approach, they fire at them, and they have shot down a total of four or six aircraft. They use ammunition very sparingly. Although not all shots hit, the distance is usually not very far. Previously, when aircraft came to drop bombs, they were only slightly higher than the utility poles, but now they fly as high as 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>(2) Since the 4th of this month, the soldiers have been lying in the trenches all day long, without rest or relief. When the Japanese see military rations being sent to the front lines, they indiscriminately drop bombs to prevent them from advancing, to the point where the soldiers cannot eat their fill. The soldiers at the front are all under the command of Brigade Commander Cheng Zhiyuan. Soldiers drawn from various places are under the unified command of one general, and they cooperate harmoniously, without any disputes or disobedience. Only because their equipment is not very sophisticated do they not attack unless the enemy is close to the front lines. Once the enemy is near, the soldiers fight like madmen, often causing the Japanese to be routed. Captured Japanese soldiers all said that it was astonishing that the Heilongjiang troops dared to fight with such inferior equipment and that they always win every battle. Furthermore, on the 10th of this month, a White Russian came from Angangxi and said that the Heilongjiang army could seize machine guns with their bare hands, even amidst the line of fire. He had served in the army during the European war and had never seen anyone seize machine guns with their bare hands. The teachers and students of the Second Normal School went to the front lines to offer their comforts. They said that once, a Japanese plane flew very low to strafe our army. Our army, in groups of twenty, lay on the ground with their guns raised to shoot at the plane. The pilot and the soldiers inside were filled with forty-six bullets. The hardship of the soldiers at the front can be imagined. General Ma Zhanshan only sleeps for three hours a day. He goes back and forth between the provincial capital and the front lines twice a day. As for Cheng and Yuan, since the start of the war, they have not had a single day of peaceful sleep.</p>
<p>(3) Chairman Ma and Brigade Commander Yuan said: We know that we are fighting as an isolated army in the desert, with no reinforcements and with equipment that is far inferior to that of the Japanese. Each Japanese soldier carries a hand-held machine gun, a pistol on their hip, and a sharp bayonet on their back, and they are protected by aircraft and heavy artillery. Their combat strength is ten to one compared to ours, and the Japanese army can come continuously, while our army loses strength with every death. There is no way we can last. However, we are willing to fight to the end, like the Belgians in the European war. A certain battalion commander said to those who went to the front lines to comfort the soldiers, "I expect to die, but I don't know if there are others who will follow in my footsteps and die on the battlefield. If there are, then my sacrifice will be worthwhile. Otherwise, China will never recover." There was also an old soldier, over forty years old, who claimed to have served in the army for twenty years and had already retired. Upon hearing that the war had started in the province, he sold his family property to join the army. On the way, he was robbed by bandits, but he sold the remainder of his family property and came to the army to serve the country. The soldiers all said that they were fighting to the death for the country and would have no regrets even if they died. Chairman Ma used tens of thousands of yuan to慰勞 the troops at the beginning of the month, and the soldiers accepted it. On the 11th, he used money again to慰勞 the troops, but the soldiers all said that they were about to die and had no need for this, and they all refused to accept it. This is enough to show the morale of the troops.</p>
<p>(4) There are many soldiers in this battle who die without being properly cared for. There are no medical teams in the army. Only those with minor injuries can crawl to the train station and go to the provincial capital for treatment. Those with serious injuries are left on the battlefield to bleed to death. Alas, how tragic!</p>
<p>(5) As I write this, I suddenly received a phone call from Angangxi, saying that this morning at four o'clock, the Japanese army, led by Lieutenant General Domen, with over 10,000 soldiers, twenty or so aircraft, and tanks, attacked. Our army was unable to resist and retreated to Wuhuma. In the middle of the battle, General Ma personally led the soldiers in a counterattack twice and personally killed two company commanders who were retreating. In the end, due to the disparity in strength, they had to retreat. It is also reported that the successor to Heilongjiang Province is not Zhang Haipeng but Zhang Jinghui. Zhang Jinghui has a very deep relationship with the Japanese, which cannot be described in this article and will be detailed in another letter.</p>
<p>(6) What I find most difficult to understand is that the highest-ranking official in the Three Eastern Provinces is the Border Defense Commander, and the outermost border of the Border Defense is Heilongjiang. Why are all the advanced weapons in the Northeast placed in Mukden, while Heilongjiang only has inferior ones? If this is intended to confront the Japanese, then the Japanese come and retreat without a fight. If it is intended to deal with internal affairs, then the Border Defense Commander is not living up to his name. Alas, the accumulation of decades and the advanced weapons of the Mukden Arsenal have all been used to aid the enemy. This is something to lament greatly.</p>
<p>(7) In the past, when the Heilongjiang army fought against Soviet Russia, there was Liang Zhongxin (the Russians who talk about battle records all say that Liang Zhongjia is inferior to Han Guangdi). Now, fighting against the Japanese, there is Ma Zhanshan. Because of his proximity to Harbin, everyone can speak of Ma's achievements. Therefore, this慰勞 came from the people spontaneously, without any initiator. This is because they are deeply moved. Readers should not say that the military discipline of Heilongjiang Province must be far superior to that of Jilin. Although I have tried my best to describe the achievements of the Heilongjiang army, I still want to make it a reliable history and not worry about over-praising them. The military discipline of both Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces is not very good. However, the reason why the Heilongjiang army can fight and the Jilin army cannot is that the generals of Heilongjiang Province all come from humble backgrounds, are steadfast and determined, and once aroused by righteous indignation, regard death as home. The soldiers are happy to work for them. As for the generals of Jilin Province, most of them are the sons and relatives of Zhang Zuoxiang. These people only know how to live in luxury, indulging in song and dance, and their courage has long been dissipated.</p>
<p>(8) In this battle of the Heilongjiang army, I believe that there are several benefits: A. It preserves the national integrity. B. The Japanese claimed that they only needed a few hundred people to take Heilongjiang Province and succeed quickly. However, they fought bitterly for more than ten days. Several thousand of Zhang Haipeng's troops were killed, and the Japanese army sent over 10,000 troops, with weaponry ten times better than ours. Over a thousand Japanese soldiers were also killed. Although our army withdrew from the battlefield, its strength is still capable of fighting again, making the Japanese know that the Chinese army cannot be bullied. C. The people of our country have long been intimidated by the power of the Japanese army. Without Ma Zhanshan's sacrifice, who would know that the Japanese army is not to be feared? Now, although Ma's army has been defeated, its defeat was within our expectations. As for his achievements, he repeatedly defeated the Japanese army and is a great role model for our country's soldiers. (November 18th)</p>

<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The rumors of Pu Yi's restoration have long been rampant. It is now learned that the pseudo-autonomous guidance department led by Yu Chonghan convened an emergency meeting at 8 AM on the 20th in the office of the department head in the east building of the Local Maintenance Committee. Those present were Yu Chonghan, Zhao Xinbo, Kan Chaoxi (replaced by Ding), Qi Enming, Gao Yuhang, Yuan Mingkai, Pseudo Finance Minister Weng Enyu (who did not attend due to illness), Chief of Staff Miyake of the Japanese Army, Consul Morioka, Advisor Kanei, Commander Ninomiya of the Kwantung Military Police, President Pu Wei of the Pseudo Four Peoples Association (replaced by Secretary-General Zheng Mingli). First, Pseudo Minister Yu Chonghan reported the purpose of convening the emergency meeting. Next, Zheng Mingli, the secretary of Pu Wei, spoke, saying that the current support for Pu Yi to organize a new independent state is to overthrow the old regime, break away from the Nanjing government, and enable the 30 million people of the Northeast to build and realize the ideal independent state. It is an attempt to benefit the people of the Eastern Provinces and is fundamentally different in nature from the restoration government movement. The establishment of the new regime is due to the efforts of the elders whom the people of the Eastern Provinces have long believed in. Next, Zhao Xinbo spoke, saying that the future new regime will be a completely democratic system. Although Pu Yi is the head of state, he is the President of Manchuria and Mongolia, not an emperor. He also proposed compiling a guard army, and it was resolved that Director Qi of the Self-Defense Police Bureau would prepare for it. It was also decided that Yu Chonghan would go to Dalian for contact and that they would depart in the afternoon. Alas, Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang Province has withdrawn from Qiqihar. From now on, the Three Eastern Provinces will be completely occupied by the brutal Japanese, and the independent state created by the traitors will soon be realized. Pu Yi, who lives in Dalian, is昏庸 and ignorant. Today, Shenyang has sent someone to welcome him. (20th)</p>

<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Japanese Navy stationed in Hankou suddenly landed for a drill and held a grand review on the morning of the 20th. The drill ground was located on River Street Road in the Japanese Concession, and the reviewing stand was located in front of the River Street non-commissioned officer and soldier meeting place. At that time, the weather was gloomy. Over thirty officers from various warships, over a hundred Japanese men and women, and the troops to be reviewed arrived at the scene one after another. The troops to be reviewed consisted of 432 naval infantrymen, twelve machine guns, thirty-six soldiers, twenty-four medical corps members, and two motor vehicles, each carrying one machine gun, a driver, and two soldiers, totaling about 500 people, lined up in a double line. They stood attentively in the drill ground, awaiting orders. In addition to the usual security measures, four naval infantrymen and eight policemen were stationed at various key points along the concession, divided into four areas to maintain order. At 10:30, Naval Commander Shiozawa arrived, escorted by sixteen accompanying officers. He landed from the Atago warship and went directly to the reviewing stand. After the commander issued the order to drill, he inspected the troops around the field. Finally, they stood in a circle in front of the stand, and Shiozawa gave a brief speech, mainly to boost morale. The event ended at 11:30. It is reported that the civil defense drill will continue in the coming days. (November 23rd)</p>

<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: After the Japanese warship Yuandao entered the inner harbor of Fuzhou, Jiang, the people of Min felt extremely indignant. Yesterday morning (the 19th), the Anti-Japanese Association and student unions of various schools elected over a hundred representatives to petition the provincial government, demanding (1) the expulsion of the Yuandao from Fuzhou; (2) the request to transfer Commander Liu back to the province; (3) the reporting and issuance of weapons to the Righteous Volunteers; (4) no interference with the National Salvation Movement; (5) assistance in reorganizing the various rural militias into national salvation reserve forces. The provincial government was represented by Committee Members Chen Peikun, Zheng Shijing, and Cheng Shiyi, who received the representatives. Their replies were as follows: First, the provincial government is actively negotiating. Second, because the banditry in northern Fujian is very serious, Commander Liu cannot come to the province entirely. He can concentrate in Yanping to prepare for any eventuality. Third, there are many difficulties, and it is difficult to comply. Fourth, they agreed to order military and police agencies to allow patriotic movements without transgressing behavior. Fifth, they agreed to order the Security Department to handle the situation after consulting the circumstances. The student representatives expressed great dissatisfaction that the provincial government did not agree to allocate weapons to the Righteous Volunteers and planned to go on strike and hold a large-scale petition on the 20th. Upon hearing the news, the provincial government immediately ordered the Education Department in the afternoon to convey instructions to the various schools, clarifying and guiding them. If the students still have other opinions, they should order a small number of representatives to come to the government to state their case. At the same time, the Martial Law Command issued a proclamation to stop them. The proclamation stated that handling foreign affairs is the responsibility of the central government, and maintaining the ground is the responsibility of the military and police. Although Sino-Japanese diplomacy is now trending towards seriousness, the method of resolution should belong to the government. All of our people must live in peace and not disturb each other. During this period, we must remain calm. This command has already reiterated the order of martial law in response to the recent rise in rumors. If there are any traitors who intend to act improperly, incite the people, and cause trouble, they will be arrested and executed immediately to maintain law and order. The wording is extremely severe, and it is unknown what the students will say in response. Furthermore, the provincial government previously telegraphed Yang Shuzhuang and Fang Shengtao to return to Fujian to preside over the provincial affairs. Now, Yang and Fang have sent Lin Zhiyuan back first to assist the various provincial committees in maintaining everything.</p>
<p>Also, news is that the military and police agencies have recently been closely protecting the safety of Japanese residents in the city. The Japanese consul has also agreed to restrain Taiwanese rogues from causing trouble. However, according to widespread rumors, Taiwanese rogues are still holding secret meetings, electing a certain Li as the mastermind and a certain Chen as the armed leader. They have divided the city into eleven districts, with Nanmendou to the city's various markets and lanes as one district, Taijiang Fuxin Street as one district, Wubao Qishe as one district, and the Qiaonan area as one district. Each district elects one district chief as the commander-in-chief to seize the opportunity to disrupt law and order. After receiving the report, the authorities have paid more attention.

<p>Regarding the case where the county magistrate of Fengxian County plotted to have the area east of Yexie Pond and north of Longquan Port in the southern part of the county transferred to the jurisdiction of Fengxian, the district chiefs of the fourteenth and fifteenth districts of the county followed orders to convene meetings with township chiefs, deputies, and local figures to solicit public opinion. Everyone was unanimously opposed. The fifteenth district even organized an association to resist the change of jurisdiction to provide support. In addition to submitting written reports, the people of the county, Geng Daochong, Wu Zaidong, Fei Xilun, Sun Chengdui, Jiang Guangguo, Jiang You, and others, jointly presented a petition to the county magistrate opposing the proposed annexation area, protesting the situation and saying, the boundary between Songjiang and Fengxian is based on the Qianbu Jing River, a natural geographical feature, with clear features. According to the records, it is clearly documented. There has never been any inconvenience in handling administrative public security matters, and we have been abiding by it for many years, and we are at peace. At a time when the national disaster is in full swing, it is time to settle inside and resist outside. The magistrate of Fengxian County is imitating the aggressive doctrine of the brutal Japanese and is acting arbitrarily, which will inevitably lead to great disputes. The will of the people is that they will never tolerate it. Please follow the public opinion and forward it to the provincial authorities, and strive to resist it, so as to avoid the county's rule being at the mercy of others. The persistence of the Songjiang people on this case is evident.</p>

Now the Finance Department believes that the 15 Qian businesses in Wuxi are assessed at 5,000 yuan, while the 32 Qian businesses in Wu are assessed at 1,400 yuan, which is a far cry. The Business Tax Bureau was ordered to inform the industry to consider increasing the amount. The industry, believing that the business market in various industries is declining and that the Qian business is bleak, sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, which was forwarded to the Ministry of Industry yesterday (the 24th), requesting a delay in the increase in order to maintain the status quo and reduce the burden.</p>

<h3 id="e22">An Old Man Strangled His Son to Death <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Lu Zhuang, a neighboring farmer in Jin Village, Nanmiao, Fushan District of the county, Hou Maosan, because his second son, Hengheng, did not do his job, stole a farmer's boat from his fellow villager Tao the other day. The owner chased him to Dayi Bridge and arrested him with the stolen goods, and handed him over to his father to restrain him. The owner took the boat back. Hou Maoshan, because his son had disgraced the family, strangled Hengheng to death with a cocoon rope tied to a tree outside in a fit of anger. Yuan and the four learned about it and immediately reported it to the town leader, who reported it to the district office and detained Hou Maoshan and sent him to the police station. Yesterday (the 23rd), he was sent to the county government for interrogation. According to Hou Maoshan's confession, he is 68 years old and has two sons. The eldest son, Zengfu, is a diligent farmer, and the second son, Hengheng, does not do his job and often goes out to steal things, disgracing the family. This time, he stole Tao's farmer's boat, and the owner arrested him with the stolen goods. At that time, I strangled him to death with a rope in a fit of anger. After the interrogation, the officials temporarily detained him pending judgment.</p>
<h3 id="e23">The District Chief of the Tenth District was Dismissed and Placed Under Supervision <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Farmers in the Dongzhang City area of the tenth district of the county gathered hundreds of people and went to the district office on October 9 to petition for a reduction in rent due to the severe floods this year. When District Chief Wang Hongyu learned about it, he sent the police team stationed in the town to Dianqiao to stop them, and a conflict broke out with the farmers. Unexpectedly, the police opened fire, killing four farmers on the spot. Afterwards, the district chief claimed that the people were rioting and that the police accidentally killed four people in self-defense and reported it to the county. Subsequently, the district party department investigated and determined that District Chief Wang Hongyu was suspected of instigating the shooting of innocent people, so he filed a complaint with the county government and the provincial authorities. The provincial authorities sent personnel to Changshu to investigate. Now the provincial authorities, believing that County Chief Tan failed to prevent the trouble beforehand and favored the district chief afterward, gave him a major demerit once. District Chief Wang Hongyu and Police Team Squad Leader Jin Dingxun were dismissed and placed under supervision, pending judicial review. After the county government received the instructions from the Civil Affairs Department on the 23rd, it ordered the police team to place Squad Leader Jin under supervision and invited District Chief Wang to the county and placed him under close surveillance. It is reported that he will be sent to the High Court for review in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="e25">The Silk Market Fell Miserably, Requesting a Reduction in Wages <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Wuxi Silk Factory Industry Association stated that there were originally 49 silk factories in the Xidi area. Last year, due to the slump in the silk market, nearly half of them failed and closed down. This year, the spring cocoon harvest was poor, which was unprecedented. The autumn cocoons have a small yield but are expensive. In order to maintain work, the factories had to raise capital and try their best to start buying. Unexpectedly, after the purchase was completed, the Shen incident suddenly broke out. The trade of silk to European and American factories first became silent, and then the price of silk fell miserably, plummeting. According to the current price of silk, it is more than 200 taels per dan lower than before the Shen incident. In addition, after the economic severance with Japan, the lower-quality goods that were usually sold exclusively to Japan were completely shelved. Financial stagnation caused huge losses. Based on the current situation, if a silk merchant spins silk into factory silk, costing about 1,200 taels, it is impossible to mortgage it to a financial institution in Shanghai or Wuxi for 300-400 taels. The suffering in this situation is difficult to describe in words. On the 17th of this month, a meeting of the entire committee was convened to discuss relief measures. As a result, it was decided to send a letter to the Silk Factory Industry Union Federation to inform the workers of each factory that starting this month, the original salary and silkworm moth allowance would be reduced by 20%, actually paying 80%, and all the original allowances would be canceled to reduce costs and maintain capital. Yesterday, a report was submitted to the county party department requesting approval for record-keeping.</p>

<p>Yang Yaoda, a notorious bandit in the area bordering Xixiang and Chengwu, disturbed the area with Gao Xiaosheng and others. After Gao was executed, Yang repented and took the initiative to request the Sixth District Office to report to the county and surrender. During the tenure of former County Chief Peng, he requested the provincial order for approval, but it required a guarantee from substantial and impartial wealthy merchants from the entire district. Yesterday (the 23rd), Xu Jiepu and others from the Sixth District, more than 20 people, reported to the county government and talked with County Chief Ma in the evening, stating everything.</p>

<p>The brutal Japanese invaded, and the whole country shared the same hatred. Everyone with blood and qi was excited. The students of the private Jianghuai Middle School here recently learned that Ma Zhanshan's army was exhausted and had no reinforcements, and that Heilongjiang had fallen again. The news was unbearable. They happened to receive representatives from Feng Yong University's anti-Japanese representatives, saying that students and righteous volunteers from all over the country who wished to go to the Northeast to participate in the anti-Japanese war should go to Beiping to unite and go together. Students Zhou Chongji, Mei Fangdong, and others from the school, numbering seventeen, believed that at a time when the whole country was advocating war, it was time for compatriots to die for their country, and immediately organized a dare-to-die team to drive out the Japanese, preparing to participate in the war. Today (the 22nd) at 2 PM, they departed from the school and went directly to the train station to wait for the train north. Over a hundred Jianghuai righteous volunteers and other classmates went to the station to see them off. They immediately sent representatives to negotiate with the station master and obtained free rides. At that time, hundreds of people were watching in the station. Principal Ma Yangbo also led many teachers to the station to see them off. Ma believed that the students did not have cotton clothes and it would be difficult to keep warm, and instructed them to prepare a little before setting off. The students believed that time was pressing and could not be delayed, and insisted on boarding the train. Therefore, Mei Fangdong and Li Qingdeng boarded the second express train north. When the train started, the teachers and students saw them off as usual. The teachers led the high-pitched slogans, which were tragic and generous, making people reluctant to leave.</p>

<p>The first batch of the group consisted of students from Fudan, Political Science, Guanghua, Daxia, Liangjiang, and other schools, totaling 692 people. After arriving in Beijing at 2:15 AM yesterday morning, they first waited at Xiaguan, waiting for the second and third batches to arrive before going to Central University to reorganize and go to the National Government to urge the government to send troops. The representative meeting also borrowed the station waiting room to hold a meeting and passed many resolutions (the original text is recorded separately). The Central Party Department rushed to send Lu Kuiwen to execute the students and explain the resettlement plan. Their attitude was still amiable. The representatives unanimously agreed and only replied to Lu that they would not talk about food or lodging until they received a satisfactory result from the government, and politely declined. The representatives of the middle school students from Suzhou also boarded the train at the Suzhou station to participate in the petition to Beijing.</p>

<p>Local News Two Anti-Japanese Association Inspectors Censured for Performing Duties; Daqing Gauze Shop Case Judgement; Ge Yunting and Others Fined Twenty Yuan Each; Crowds Make Trouble for Police Barracks Lawyer</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association recently received a tip that Daqing Gauze Shop at 376 Ningbo Road (opened by Shao Zhonghe) was selling "Ten Perfection Ten Beauty" brand gauze from the Shiquan Cotton Weaving Factory, which was actually Japanese goods in disguise. The association sent personnel to investigate and confirmed this situation. On the 22nd of this month, the association sent Ge Yunting, assistant to the inspection department; Yang Haichang, head of the special inspection team; and inspectors Shi Xinmin and Ju Zongyan, along with four workers, to Daqing Shop at 10:00 AM to confiscate eleven packages of Shiquan brand gauze and send them to the Anti-Japanese Association for sealing. However, Li Jiafu, an employee of the shop, refused.</p>
<p>He also reported the matter to the Laozha Police Station, which dispatched police officers to arrest Ge and the other three, and transported them to the First Special District Police Station, where they were prosecuted for robbery under Article 346 of the Criminal Code. This was reported in previous issues of this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Zhou Han of the Criminal Division presided over the continued hearing in the First Criminal Court. Mr. Bo Liang, representing the police barracks, and lawyers Chen Tingrui and Yu Hualong, representing the defendants, were all present on time. First, the police barrister stated that a witness, Qian Hongcai, was present in court today and could testify that the Shiquan brand gauze was entirely domestic goods. Subsequently, Qian Hongcai testified that he was an employee of the Shiquan Factory, and that the Ten Perfection Ten Beauty brand produced by the factory was entirely manufactured by the factory itself and was not imported goods. Ge Yunting and others were questioned and stated that they were working as voluntary staff in the Anti-Japanese Association. They said it was truly heartbreaking that they were suffering this outcome for loving their country.</p>
<p>Judge Zhou then ordered the commencement of arguments. First, the police barrister argued that, in addition to the law, the protection of human rights was also governed by the Provisional Constitution promulgated by the National Government. Therefore, China had entered a time of rule by law, and all people had to abide by the law and the Provisional Constitution. Article 8 of the Provisional Constitution stipulated that no one could be arrested, detained, interrogated, or punished except in accordance with the law. Article 10 stipulated that the residence of the people could not be invaded, searched, or sealed without legal basis. Article 16 stipulated that the property of the people could not be sealed or confiscated without legal basis. All people should know and abide by these three articles. Furthermore, Article 346 of the Criminal Code stipulated that robbery involved the use of violence, coercion, or hypnotic drugs to render a person unable to resist. However, the crime of robbery did not necessarily require physical intimidation.</p>
<p>Even intangible intimidation constituted robbery. This had been interpreted by the former Supreme Court in its Shang Zi No. 366 ruling three years ago. Intangible intimidation, rendering a person unable to resist, also constituted robbery. The testimony of witness Zhang Haiqing, who stated in court last time that he was detained by the Anti-Japanese Association on the 18th and held in a room for about three hours, and that he was only released after his father provided bail, indicated that Zhang Haiqing's freedom had been deprived, and the court should protect him. Furthermore, the defendants went to the Daqing Shop in a group of eight people, which was unbelievable without the use of violence and intimidation. While patriotism was universally known, and no one wanted to be a slave of a conquered nation, patriotism must also comply with the law. One could not violate the law in the name of patriotism. The defendants had violated the law out of patriotism and should be punished according to the law, but their punishment should be mitigated because their crime was motivated by patriotism.</p>
<p>The court was urged to judge the case with a calm eye and a calm attitude. The Public Works Department had also previously notified the Anti-Japanese Association that it must safeguard public order and the freedom of the people. Whether the Anti-Japanese Association was a legitimate organization was a point that should be proven by the defendants. The barrister asked the court to handle this case according to the law. Defendant's barrister Yu Hualong replied that if the Anti-Japanese Association was an illegal organization, the Chinese authorities would have already taken action to ban it. Anti-Japanese Associations existed in almost every part of the Republic of China, and the newspapers were mostly reporting on the activities of the Anti-Japanese Association. Had the police barrister never seen this? The barrister said the police's prosecution of the four defendants was suppressing the patriotic movement of the people, which was tragic. China also had an army that could resist Japan, but the government initially adopted a policy of calmness and non-resistance, and then said it would wait for the League of Nations to resolve the issue, resulting in the entire territory of the Eastern Provinces falling into the hands of the Japanese. Recently, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, a member of the Central Committee, also organized a National Crisis Conference. Why could the people not have an Anti-Japanese Association? Why did the police barracks fail to suppress the atrocities of the Japanese but instead suppressed the patriotic movement of the people? This was incomprehensible. The defendants gave a formal receipt when they carted away the plaintiff's goods.</p>
<p>Therefore, how could this be called robbery? Therefore, this case could not stand and should be dismissed. Chen Tingrui then argued that the Anti-Japanese Association was formed because Japan disregarded international law and international trust and invaded the Eastern Provinces. The government's response was not for them to discuss, but the people had to have a way to save and defend themselves. Therefore, the Anti-Japanese Association was formed to carry out economic sanctions against Japan. The government also knew that this was a way for the people to save and defend themselves and the country and did not ban it. Why should the police barracks overstep their bounds? In order for the crime of robbery to be established, certain conditions must be met. The police barrister only relied on the second half of Article 346 of the Criminal Code in their arguments, forgetting the first half. According to the first half of the article, the intention must be to illegally possess the goods for oneself or a third party. However, the defendants transported the plaintiff's goods to the Anti-Japanese Association, so they did not possess them for themselves. The Anti-Japanese Association only took possession of the goods for safekeeping.</p>
<p>If the plaintiff could provide proof that the detained goods were domestic goods, the Anti-Japanese Association would certainly return them. Therefore, a third party did not illegally possess them. The police barracks could not prove that the goods of the Daqing Shop were divided among the defendants or the members of the Anti-Japanese Association. They recklessly prosecuted them for robbery, which was deeply regrettable. He asked the court to dismiss the police barracks' charges and acquit the defendants. Finally, defendant Shi Xinmin stated that if they were convicted of robbery, he would rather die in the courtroom, as it was acceptable to sacrifice oneself for patriotism, but he was unwilling to be falsely accused of robbery.</p>
<p>After reviewing the testimony, Judge Zhou Han ruled that the four defendants, Ge Yunting and others, had jointly used violence and coercion to force others to do something they were not obligated to do. They were each fined twenty yuan. If they could not pay the fine, they would be imprisoned, with three yuan equivalent to one day. Each was granted a two-year suspended sentence. Each was required to post a bail of three hundred yuan during the appeal period. After the case was heard, forty to fifty people gathered outside the courtroom, wanting to make trouble for the police barracks barrister. Some were shouting to beat him. The nearby Huishi Police Station was informed and dispatched Chinese and foreign police officers to escort the police barracks barrister out of the court before the crowd dispersed. Xue Die Appeals for Continued Trial</p>
<p>Crowd's Enthusiasm for Hu Die</p>
<p>Difficulty for Bailiffs to Maintain Order</p>
<p>Lin Xuehuai Proves No Debt</p>
<p>Arguments Concluded, Judgement Scheduled</p>
<p>The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court scheduled to continue the trial yesterday at 2:00 PM of the appeal case of Lin Xuehuai, who refused to accept the verdict of the First Special District District Court to dissolve his marriage contract with Hu Die and to repay the debt of more than one thousand yuan. Young men and women were all captivated by Hu Die's beauty. Around 1:00 PM, they went to the Second Tribunal of the court to watch the trial. Before 2:00 PM, the tribunal was already overcrowded. Those who arrived later continued to pour in.</p>
<p>Although the bailiffs politely advised them to leave, they not only refused to leave but also sat high on the chairs. When Hu Die arrived in court, escorted by her father, Hu Shaogong, the crowd applauded and shouted wildly, and all eyes were on her. The court bailiffs found her a seat, and she sat down with her father. At 2:30 PM, the presiding judge, Hu Yigu, noted that the Second Tribunal was too crowded, and there was too much noise, which was interfering with the trial. He ordered the chief of the judicial police to increase the number of Chinese and foreign bailiffs to disperse the idlers in the tribunal to maintain order. However, no one was willing to leave.</p>
<p>Judge Hu determined that the audience was beyond reason. He ordered the trial to be moved to the First Tribunal. Unexpectedly, as soon as the news came out, the crowd rushed downstairs and headed for the First Tribunal. Those downstairs swarmed upstairs. As a result, Judge Hu, Judges Shen and Ye, and Clerk Qian were blocked in the middle of the stairs, unable to move forward or backward. More bailiffs were dispatched to try to clear the crowd. It took half an hour to clear all the onlookers inside and outside the First and Second Tribunals upstairs and downstairs. The judges, lawyers, and parties involved were able to enter the First Tribunal safely and begin the trial. It was exactly 3:00 PM. Still afraid that the crowd would flood in, all doors were closed and guarded by bailiffs. No one was allowed to enter without permission, so there were only more than thirty people in the tribunal, and only three to five were women. If it were not for this arrangement, the trial could not have started yesterday. This was truly a rare situation since the establishment of the court. Hu Die wore a dark coat with a mink collar and sleeves. Lin Xuehuai was still in a Western suit and a tweed coat. The court first asked Lin Xuehuai the reason for his appeal. According to Lin, the 600 yuan was withdrawn from the bank on behalf of Hu Die, and after receiving it, it was handed over to Hu Die. The 380 taels were used to purchase a car and had been settled and repaid in foreign currency. The cost of clothing from Rongchangxiang and the rent had been settled. The appellant had no sufficient reason to terminate the marriage contract.</p>
<p>According to Hu Die, Hu Die Company was opened in partnership with her father and managed by her father. Lin had not repaid the debts. The amount she was suing for was based on her memory. She had waived the debts that she could not remember. As for the termination of the contract, it was originally advocated by Lin. His letter stated that he had broken off all relations with her, and she had a bad reputation, so she asked the court to uphold the original judgement. In addition, he should also compensate her for one thousand yuan of mental losses. Lin then stated that her allegations that he owed her money had no evidence. If he had no money, how could he open a photo studio? Now that she was asking for a termination of the contract and compensation for losses, but because he did not want to terminate the contract, he would not be responsible for the losses. At that point, the arguments began. First, Lin's barristers, E Sen and Ni Zheng, stated that based on the various evidence, Hu Die Company was solely owned by her father. Hu Die could not claim rights. The 600 yuan had been investigated by the court at the Hongkou branch of Shanghai Bank. The bank replied that there was no Lin Xuehuai's name in the account.</p>
<p>Therefore, the appellant's previous statement that she lent Lin Xuehuai 600 yuan, which Lin converted into 500 taels and deposited in the bank, was unreliable. According to the insurance company, the Hu Die Company lost part of the goods due to carelessness. There were no account books, so her claim that the account books were burned was also unbelievable. Lin was not responsible for the delayed marriage, so there was no reason to compensate for the one thousand yuan loss. The barrister asked the court to overturn the original judgement and uphold the marriage contract. In addition, the appellee's incidental appeal should be dismissed. Next, Hu Die's barrister, Zhan Jifeng, replied that the appellant's barrister's arguments were nothing more than strong arguments to deny the debt. Even if the company was solely owned by Hu Die's father, her father had already stated that he had authorized his daughter to pursue the case. Furthermore, Hu Die now stated that she had shares in the company. If Lin did not owe money, he could provide evidence to prove it. This showed that he was admitting that he owed money but was claiming that Hu Die could not claim it. As for the 600 yuan, a star employee who had been asked to testify by Lin had testified in court that he had heard that Hu Die had lent money to Lin.</p>
<p>In short, all the loans were given by Hu to Lin, so there was no need to record them in the accounts. Even if the accounts were not destroyed in the fire, there was no need to investigate them. As for the termination of the contract, it was originally advocated by Lin. Not only was there a letter to prove it, but his statement published in the newspaper also still advocated for the termination of the contract. He suddenly did not want to terminate the contract after the first trial judgement, which showed that he intended to delay the proceedings. According to the Civil Code, the party at fault for terminating a marriage contract should be liable for damages. Since Lin was at fault, Hu Die had filed an incidental appeal, requesting that he pay one thousand yuan of consolation money. After the arguments were completed, the court scheduled the judgement for the afternoon of December 2nd. It was exactly 4:30 PM. Hu Die walked out of the court. The crowd was still waiting for her and applauded, causing a commotion again. The crowd dispersed when she got into the car. Autopsy Report of the Four Corpses Unearthed in Xiude Lane</p>
<p>All Claimed by Family Members</p>
<p>After seven bodies of men and women were found strangled in Nos. 33 and 37, Aitang Village, Yao Zhujiao Road, French Concession, and later, a total of three women and one man were found in No. 6, Xiude Lane, Wuding Road, Public Concession, the details of which have been reported in previous newspapers, all four corpses were transported to the autopsy station in Philan Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, prosecutor of the First Special District Court, went to the station to examine the corpses and presided over the case. According to Wang Bin, captain of the Songhu Garrison Command, after receiving a telegram from Beijing, he went to No. 6, Xiude Lane, with the Gordon Road Police Station and unearthed Zhang Lushi, Zhang Xinghua, Ye Xiaomei, and Si Li. Now, family members had arrived to claim the bodies. According to Zhang Changgeng, a 16-year-old man from Songjiang, Zhang Lushi was his mother and Zhang Xinghua was his older sister. He was originally living in the capital. After this incident was discovered, he came to Shanghai. According to Si Chenshi, a 28-year-old woman from Zhejiang living in Zhabei, Shanghai, Si Li was her husband. He left home at 3:00 PM on July 24th of this year and never returned. There were two children at home. She learned that he had been strangled after seeing the newspaper report. According to Chen Asong, Ye Xiaomei was his wife. He had not seen her since she left in early April of the lunar calendar. He lived in Songjiang. After hearing the testimonies, Guo ruled that the male deceased, Si Li, and the female deceased, Zhang Xinghua, Zhang Lushi, and Ye Xiaomei, had all been strangled to death. Si Li's body was handed over to his wife, Si Chenshi, for burial. The bodies of Zhang Xinghua and Zhang Lushi were handed over to Zhang Changgeng for burial. Ye Xiaomei's body was handed over to her husband, Chen Asong. They each signed a certificate to receive the bodies for burial. A bundle of rope was handed over to the stolen goods warehouse. The police barracks were ordered to strictly pursue the criminals and bring them to justice. Xu Zhimo's Funeral Held Yesterday</p>

<p>Police Officer Had Only Been on Duty for Forty Days</p>
<p>Zhabei Fourth District Public Security Bureau police officer Xiong Guozhao was on duty at the intersection of Xinmin Road and Datong Road around 12:00 PM the night before yesterday. Rickshaw puller Zhang Xiaolong was eating noodles at a nearby noodle stall. As he stood up after finishing his meal, a bullet flew out of Xiong's gun, hitting Zhang under his left rib and exiting from his right rib. He immediately bled profusely and fell to the ground, dying. The incident was heard by the district chief of the district, who immediately arrested the police officer and reported the incident to the court for an autopsy. It was claimed that at the time of the incident, the police officer saw a suspicious pedestrian flashing by the road and held his gun in his hand. He accidentally misfired and shot Zhang. Another theory was that the police officer was cleaning his gun when the accident occurred. The deceased, Zhang Xiaolong, was 40 years old, from Nantong. He lived at 120 Pingfang, Jingjiang Road. His wife, Wu, had an eight-month-old child, and his 70-year-old mother was in his hometown. The family was destitute. District Chief Zhou of the Fourth District felt sorry for them and donated his salary to the widow to buy a coffin and prepare for the burial. It was also heard that Xiong Guozhao, who caused the accident, had only been a police officer for about forty days. Three Abduction Cases on the Fu'an Steamer</p>
<p>All Committed by People from Xinghua, Fujian</p>
<p>Cases of kidnapping women and children and selling them to other places have been occurring frequently in this city in recent days. Yesterday, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team police officers broke up three abduction cases on the Fu'an steamer bound for Fujian Province, arresting four abductors and rescuing one abducted woman, two girls, and one boy. The details are recorded below: (1) Zhang Changxi, a squad leader of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, and detective Liu Changrui were patrolling the river to Nanshi Wharf around 9:00 AM yesterday when they saw the Fu'an steamer berthed there. They boarded the steamer to conduct an inspection. They found a man carrying a boy in the cabin. When they saw the police team, they appeared uneasy. When questioned about their origins, they stammered and appeared suspicious. They were immediately taken back to the team. Chief Xu interrogated the man, who gave his name as Hu Ahua, 45 years old, from Xinghua, Fujian. He claimed to be engaged in the longan business. His remaining words were vague. The boy claimed to be Wang Agen, 6 years old, from Changzhou. About five days ago, he was playing outside his home in his hometown when Hu told him that Shanghai was a very good place to play. If he wanted to go, Hu could take him there, but he could not let his parents know. He was very happy to hear this and followed Hu to Shanghai. He did not know anything else. The squad leader ordered that he be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation on charges of kidnapping. (2) Around 10:00 AM yesterday, the police officers found Zhu Chengjia and Zhang Zhicheng, from Xinghua, Fujian, on the steamer with two girls. They appeared suspicious. They were immediately taken to the team. During the interrogation, Chief Xu learned that Shi Chenjia was 39 years old and was engaged in the longan business. One of the girls, Jiang Lian Gui, was 18 years old, from Wuxing. He had purchased her and was planning to take her to Fujian to be his wife. Zhang Zhicheng claimed to be 31 years old, engaged in the same business as Zhu. The other girl, Zhang Jindi, was 13 years old and from the same hometown as Jiang Lian Gui. He had been introduced to her by a person in Huzhou. He had given money to bring Jindi to his hometown in Xinghua to be his son's wife. It was ordered that he be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation on charges of trafficking people. (3) Wang Yulong and Liu Qingwu, squad leaders of the Bailianjing police station in Pudong, also found a man with a woman on the Fu'an steamer around 11:00 AM yesterday. When they saw the police arrive, their faces turned pale, and they looked very suspicious. They were immediately detained and taken to the team. During the interrogation, Chief Xu learned that the man's name was Huang Xichun, 29 years old, from Xinghua, Fujian. He was engaged in the longan business. The woman had been his concubine for more than a month. This time, he planned to take her back to his hometown to live together. The woman claimed to be Shen Zhangshi, 21 years old, from Pudong. A few days ago, a little sister named Yin Di introduced her to Huang in the Xiaodongmen Central Hotel. Huang said that Fujian was much more lively than Shanghai. She was happy to hear this, so she took the steamer with him today. She lived at the Shen family lane in Huang Yangjiadu, Pudong. She was charged with abducting a married woman and taking her to another place with the intention of trafficking. The police officers were immediately dispatched to the address to bring in Shen Zhangshi's aunt, Shen Yanshi, for questioning and were transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for verification. Jinshuntai Fishing Boat Encountered Pirates En Route</p>
<p>Goods Thrown into the Sea</p>
<p>Pirates in the Wenzhou-Taizhou waters outside of the Wusong Sanjiashui Estuary have recently become increasingly rampant. Incidents of robbery have been reported from time to time. Because there have been no major cases of kidnapping or injury, the robberies have not been reported to the authorities for investigation, which has made the pirates even more daring. A fishing boat, Jinshuntai, loaded with paper and coal from various businesses in Nantong in Wenzhou, was sailing to the waters of Dinghai when it was suddenly attacked by more than forty pirates, who opened fire and gave chase. Because the fishing boat had no ability to resist, the pirates swarmed aboard and searched the ship. The crew's clothes and belongings were all looted. However, the goods on board were mostly paper and coal, so the pirates threw more than a hundred items of paper and coal into the sea in frustration. The fishing boat has now escaped safely to Songjiang yesterday and reported the incident to the Penglai Public Office, which forwarded the report to the Fourth Water Police Unit for dispatching troops to pursue the pirates and sent telegrams to various businesses in Wenzhou and Tongzhou to report the robbery. Although the crew members were not injured, the losses of the businesses were considerable. Shanghai University Professor's Wife Enthusiastically Helps with Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The wife of a professor at Shanghai University has always been enthusiastic about community service. In view of the serious floods, she has donated money for disaster relief and has been spending two hours every afternoon making cotton clothes. It is reported that she has made more than a hundred sets, which will be personally taken to the disaster relief shelter by Mrs. Xu Zuohe and Mrs. Lin Zhuoran this afternoon, along with words of comfort. Tenants of Yixin Lane Petition to Municipal Authorities Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the landlord Cheng Linsheng ordering the tenants of Yixin Lane on Nanjing Road to move out, the details have been reported in this newspaper. The tenants of Yixin Lane believe that this case not only affects the lease rights of all residents in the city, but also has an impact on the construction plan of the city center. Yesterday, they sent representatives such as Shen Caimao to petition to the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government, and presented a written statement requesting relief. The Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government each sent representatives to meet with them and agreed to forward the letter to the court for fair handling. The petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>Presenting a Petition on the Matter of Landlords Forcibly Evicting Tenants and Shaking Lease Rights Amidst the National Crisis, Making Business and Residence Difficult. We, the citizens, lease the buildings in Yixin Lane at the corner of Nanjing Road and Xizang Road in the First Special District of Shanghai for business and residence. The building has only been built for ten years, and the citizens have spent huge sums of money on rent, excavation fees, renovation, advertising, and other expenses, believing that it would be available for at least twenty years. Unexpectedly, the landlord Cheng Linsheng is a wealthy but unbenevolent person who, having amassed a huge fortune, seeks to further enrich himself by exploiting merchants. He first suggested to the citizens to increase the rent significantly. The citizens declined, citing the global economic recession, the floods in various provinces, and the Japanese invasion of the Eastern Provinces, which have led to a commercial downturn. Cheng Linsheng then cited the excuse of renovating the buildings and issued a notice to forcibly evict them. In this autumn of national crisis, in addition to maintaining their businesses and residences, the citizens want to concentrate on contributing their efforts to alleviate the national crisis. The Party and government agencies also believe that disputes between labor and management should not occur during this time of national emergency in order to stabilize the economic order and prevent the authorities from dividing their energies, which would indirectly allow the Japanese invaders to take advantage of the situation. The landlord, however, disregards public opinion and leisurely implements the forced eviction of tenants, shaking the lease rights of tenants and affecting the economic order, which is even more serious than labor-management disputes. The damage to the social economy and the indirect assistance to the Japanese invaders are even more chilling. Cheng Linsheng is the largest landowner in Shanghai, with more than ten thousand buildings. His sole and ingenious method is to rack his brains and constantly exploit his tenants. What the citizens have suffered is only the beginning. Once this trend starts, not only those who lease his buildings will suffer the pain of difficulty in business and residence, but the impact will also be enough to encourage real estate speculators to follow suit. Then, the citizens in the city who lease buildings for business and residence will face the fact of being displaced, and Shanghai's market will be fundamentally destroyed. Not to mention that the responsibility for touring will be entirely placed on the citizens who cannot afford to rent the tall buildings, which will affect the financial industry and hinder the construction of the city center. Since Cheng Linsheng has the funds to renovate the tall buildings, the city center needs construction. With these funds, many buildings can be built in the city center, which is related to municipal administration and should be filed for verification. We respectfully request that you allow us to stop Cheng Linsheng's eviction behavior and avoid shaking the lease rights and making it difficult for citizens to do business and reside.</p>
<p>We also request that you advise him to use the renovation funds to build the buildings needed in the city center in order to promote municipal administration and help the rapid implementation of the Great Shanghai Plan, which is convenient for both the public and private sectors. Ren Zhennan Divorces Wife</p>
<p>Both Parties Agree to Unconditional Divorce</p>
<p>Lawyer Ren Zhennan was sued by his wife, Ren Jiangshi (also known as Jiang Xingjuan), through lawyer Tao Jiachun in the Civil Court of the District Court, requesting separation and alimony. The court hearing had not yet been concluded. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Judge Chen Bingxin specially opened the Eighth Tribunal for the trial. The defendant, Ren Zhennan, was brought from the detention center. Ren also retained lawyer Xue Jiaqi to defend him. The plaintiff, Ren Jiangshi, and lawyer Tao arrived one after another. The judge asked both parties a few words. Lawyer Tao said that after the court adjourned last time, he had repeatedly advised the defendant, but the defendant thought that the plaintiff had a monetary mindset, which was not true. There was no result at that time. The judge asked Ren Zhennan if he was willing to reconcile. Lawyer Xue replied that the defendant intended to have the plaintiff withdraw the criminal charge No. 136 of the Di Zi case from your court. The judge said that if the defendant was willing to reconcile, all lawsuits could be concluded. Ren replied that he was willing to reconcile, but the criminal part should be withdrawn. The judge said, then would you live together or separately? He replied, live together. At this point, Ren Jiangshi said loudly that she did not want to live together. The judge said to Jiangshi, would it be okay if Ren paid you a certain amount of living expenses every month, and you did not sue him criminally? She replied, I must sue him. He has treated me too harshly. The judge said to Ren, what do you mean? Ren replied, then I will divorce her, but she should also withdraw the criminal charge. I sue her for false accusations, then I will withdraw it. The judge asked Jiangshi how she would express it. The trial for criminal charge No. 28 was scheduled, and it was unknown whether it could be withdrawn. Lawyer Tao said that you could request it in court. Jiang further stated that after the divorce, what would happen if he killed her? The judge said that this would not happen. Therefore, both parties were willing to divorce unconditionally, and the reconciliation was established. The judge drafted the reconciliation record in court. The criminal charge was withdrawn by the plaintiff, and the defendant withdrew the part of the lawsuit in which he accused the plaintiff of false accusations. Both parties signed the record and left the court. Ren was returned to custody. Thus, the interesting case of a lawyer being accused of buggery by his wife, which had caused a sensation in society, came to an end. Two Major Scientific Translation Publications</p>
<p>For the purpose of promoting scientific research, the Commercial Press has recently translated and published two major scientific works. One is "A History of European Thought in the Nineteenth Century," a book that specializes in scientific thought. It was written by British scholar T. Merz and translated by Wu Guangjian. It has long been regarded as the most authoritative work in the history of thought. The entire work has more than one million words and will be published early next month. Pre-orders are now being accepted and will close at the end of this month. The other is "The Outline of Science," which is praised worldwide. It was written by British Professor Thomson and translated by 21 university professors, including Hu Mingfu. The press has previously published a hardcover Chinese translation of this book. Now, in order to achieve greater popularity, it is continuing to print a paperback version, which is sold at a special price that is less than one-third of the price of the hardcover version. Compared with the selling price of the original English book, it is only one-eighth of the price. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Solicits National Product Trademarks</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the city's mercerized cotton weaving industry, cotton cloth industry, and Chinese-owned yarn mills soliciting various trademarks. The original letter stated, "We are writing to inform you that on the 24th of this month, we received a letter from the Guangzhou Shangyang Cloth Industry Association stating that your companies have been establishing many factories in recent years, and there are various types of machine-woven foreign-style fabrics, making it difficult to determine which country or factory produced them. With the recent anti-Japanese issue, economic sanctions against Japan should be strictly enforced. We are afraid that cunning people will misrepresent the goods, and it will be easy to be deceived without accurate verification. Therefore, we are forwarding this letter to you, hoping that you will thoroughly investigate the trademarks and styles of the products of various foreign-owned factories in your area and provide a list for our reference. The Hong Kong Chinese Weaving General Association is now attaching a booklet of trademarks of the products of its member factories for your reference. This method is simple and easy to implement. The association believes that Shanghai can also follow suit. Based on the above situation, in addition to sending separate letters, we are sending this letter to you, requesting that your association collect as many trademarks as possible of the factories of your members and the products of Western goods circulating in the market, and paste them into separate booklets for our reference, so that we can distinguish and forward them. We look forward to hearing from you." The Great East Book Company</p>
<p>Second Declaration of Striking Workers</p>
<p>The Great East Book Company workers issued a second declaration on the strike. All workers in the city, all compatriots, we, all the workers, are forced to strike because of the pain of life and the oppression of capitalists, demanding personal liberation. It has been ten days now. During these ten days, the sinister and evil prototype of the capitalists has become even more clear. On the one hand, they turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to the demands of all our striking workers and still have not realized anything. On the other hand, they spread rumors and conspire to undermine us. In terms of publicity, they rely on Party and government agencies as a shield. By posting notices, they point out that our strike by all the workers for not getting reasonable demands is called (disregarding laws and human feelings). May I ask, being arbitrarily exploited by capitalists and starving to freeze to make money for capitalists is considered in accordance with laws and human feelings? They dare to claim that the conditions proposed by our all the workers have not been passed by the general assembly. We have been proposing conditions for three months, and there have been several negotiations and several mediations by the authorities. The facts are all there, so how can we erase it? It is even more absurd to say that the strike demanded by all the workers is instigated by a few bad elements. This is really telling lies and completely concealing all kinds of crimes such as shirking and rejecting the conditions demanded by the workers, and dismissing workers, so as to confuse the public and especially to spread the word in various newspapers and threaten the striking workers with the complete dismissal and recruitment of new workers. They use all kinds of conspiracies, use evil forces, and forcibly demand the unconditional return of the workers in order to eliminate the workers' struggle. The capitalists' calculations are truly at the top of the sinister. However, these kinds of deception, intimidation, rumor-mongering, and oppression have long been in our workers' expectations. Not only can they not shake the workers' emotions, but they can also make our workers' organizations more solid and our will more determined. (We swear not to return to work until we achieve our goals) has become the only motto in our strike. We, all the striking workers, have already seen through the capitalists' sinister calculations. Therefore, the Zhonghua, Minzhi, Commercial, and World Four Book Companies, which are in the same environment and share the same interests as us, are even more motivated to donate money for relief, issue declarations of condolences and assistance, and enthusiastically support our reasonable strike. Other trade unions and groups also provide mutual assistance and add condolences with class sympathy. This is really very grateful and exciting for us, and makes the capitalists angry and tremble. We know that the victory or failure of our strike not only affects all printing workers in Shanghai, but also affects</p>
<p>Page 12</p>
<p>all workers in various industries in Shanghai. The Great East Capitalists saw this, so in order to protect their capitalists' interests, they did not hesitate to use all kinds of means to destroy us. However, all Shanghai printing workers and workers in various industries support, assist, comfort, and supervise us, which is also a manifestation of using the power of the entire working class to deal with the Great East Capitalists. Therefore, we should take on the huge responsibility that all Shanghai workers shoulder, not disappoint all Shanghai workers, and continue the struggle with an indomitable spirit of sacrifice. We also hope that all Shanghai printing workers and workers in various industries will more actively come forward to help us, so as to achieve a victorious solution to the conditions. Our slogans are: (1) Oppose the cunning, deceitful, autocratic, dictatorial, and stubborn Manager Shen; (2) Deny the unfair and unreasonable oppression of favoring one over another; (3) Defeat the union thieves and running dogs who destroy the workers' groups; (4) Support the strike committee and delegation; (5) We swear not to return to work until we achieve our goals.

<p>Honjo Arrives in Xinmin to Command</p>
<p>Garrison Troops in Jinzhou Dig Trenches</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 5 PM today, a train carrying over 200 Japanese soldiers arrived from Huanggu屯 to Xinmin, occupying Xinmin station. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Honjo arrived in Xinmin on the 24th to command the attack on Jinzhou. County Magistrate Wei of Xinmin was forced to flee by Japanese soldiers. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a dispatch from Xinmin, last night's passenger train from Shenyang to Jinzhou stopped at Xinmin because of fighting ahead in Gaochengzi. According to eyewitnesses, the Japanese army, under the pretext of suppressing bandits, is now shelling Xinmin with armored trains, and the bombardment has not stopped as of this morning. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to an urgent telegram from Jinzhou: (1) Over 200 Japanese soldiers occupied Xinmin County and the station at 4 PM on the 25th. Telephone and telegraph communications east of Xinmin are completely cut off. (2) Japanese soldiers are engaged in fierce fighting with bandits in the streets of Xinmin. (3) The Japanese army is advancing westward from Xinmin and occupied Liuhegou station at 5 PM, surrounding the station with barbed wire. After 5 PM, many troop trains arrived from Juliuhe. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a dispatch from Goubangzi, the people of Jinzhou are terrified by the news of the Japanese army's attack. However, all institutions are functioning as usual, and Western missionaries have not left. Local garrison troops have abandoned their policy of non-resistance and are adopting a self-defense approach, digging trenches near Jinzhou. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a dispatch from Jinzhou, at 8 AM on the 25th, over 800 Japanese infantrymen boarded trains at Huanggu屯 and moved towards Xinmin, to the area of Liuhegou, Raoyanghe, Tangjiawopu, and Goubangzi, where banditry is rampant. Two Japanese aircraft scouted the area of Xinmin and Heishan at noon on the 25th. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Army Headquarters in Shenyang has been holding meetings for days, reportedly deciding to launch a frontal attack on Jinzhou by advancing westward from Xinmin. Japanese troops in Yingkou crossed the river on the 25th, planning to strengthen their position in Panshantai to contain Chinese troops in the Goubangzi area. At the same time, they are instigating Mongolian bandits to occupy Tongliao and Zhangwu, so as to advance towards the Datonglu Road and connect with the Siping-Taonan Railway. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a dispatch from Jinzhou, the Japanese army is actively plotting to seize Jinzhou. Armored trains carrying large numbers of Japanese troops have arrived at Juliuhe, surrounding the station with barbed wire and cutting off transportation. Japanese soldiers, armed to the teeth, are checking pedestrians. Residents are fleeing westward from Xinmin. Over a dozen Japanese aircraft and over a hundred landmines have been transported to Juliuhe. Rong Zhen, to avoid attracting attention, has rented a small house in a back alley for overnight stays, accompanied only by one bodyguard in plain clothes. Rong told foreign reporters that the Japanese army, having failed to disrupt our army by using Zhang Xuecheng and Ling Yinqing, is now using the pretext of unsuppressed bandits to attack our Jinzhou area, intending to destroy our military and political organs in Jinzhou. We are determined to adhere to our previous policy, appealing for international arbitration and taking appropriate self-defense measures. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a dispatch from Jinzhou, the Japanese army, under the cover of Mongolian and Korean bandits, attacked Xinmin at 1 PM on the 24th, occupying Gaotaizi Village, 18 miles from the city. County Magistrate Wei negotiated with the Japanese side, which promised to telegraph the Japanese army stationed in Juliuhe to stop the advance. However, at 3 PM, the Japanese army dispatched an armored train and a troop train, totaling three vehicles, with over a hundred Japanese soldiers, from Huanggu屯 to the Gaotaizi area, reinforcing their forces and firing thirteen shells towards the southeast of Xinmin City, putting Xinmin in a critical situation. Subsequently, the Japanese army continued to advance, and the county security team resisted with all their might, but part of their forces were disarmed by the Japanese army. Japanese armored vehicles continuously shelled the vicinity of Xinmin Station, with the remaining shells falling in the suburbs. Our armored train was dispatched to Raoyanghe for reconnaissance. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that Major General Mori of the Japanese army has achieved considerable success in suppressing bandits in the area between the South Manchurian Railway and Tankangzi (east of Niuzhuang). According to recent reports, the Japanese army encircled the main force of the bandits from all sides, bombed them with aircraft, and shelled them with artillery, inflicting heavy casualties. The bandits were completely defeated, and the remnants fled across the Liao River. According to Japanese sources, a large number of bandits, numbering several thousand, have recently been looting in the area between Shenyang and Tankangzi. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The reporter tried all day to obtain official news of the fighting that occurred near Shenyang this morning, but was unable to do so. When inquired again at 10:30 tonight, the answer was that the staff of Honjo's headquarters had already gone to bed. They had said that there was heavy fighting 25 miles from Shenyang in the afternoon. How can they all be sleeping soundly at 10:30? Upon further visiting the headquarters, the reporter finally met a spokesman who said that the reports of today's fighting were greatly exaggerated and were probably just minor skirmishes. (Reuters dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese reports, the situation west of Shenyang remains dangerous. Official circles here believe that if the Chinese troops in Jinzhou do not withdraw voluntarily, a serious conflict will be unavoidable. It is reported that British Ambassador to China Lampson is preparing to warn Japan not to conduct operations on the Beining Railway line, as this would affect the interests of British creditors. Official circles commenting on this news said that Japan is prepared to fully compensate for any losses suffered by this road due to Japanese military actions. There are reports that the situation west of Shenyang is gradually becoming serious, but the situation in North Manchuria seems to have calmed down. According to official sources, a regiment of Japanese soldiers may withdraw from Qiqihar today. The Japanese government originally intended to ask the League of Nations to order the Chinese troops in Jinzhou to withdraw, but has now cancelled this proposal, as it knows that the League of Nations and China are unlikely to agree to it. At the same time, the Japanese government has considered the five new articles of the League of Nations draft and has decided to agree to all of them except for the clause in the second article stating "[neither party shall take any action that may lead to war or casualties]". The Japanese government insists on deleting or amending this clause, because acknowledging this clause would restrict the Japanese army's ability to suppress bandits and take necessary self-defense measures. What Japan can believe in is only avoiding increasing the burden of the situation. Japanese official circles also said that Japan's agreement to send a committee to investigate the Manchurian incident and its demand that China must first recognize the five basic points before withdrawing are already great concessions by Japan to break the deadlock and preserve the face of the League of Nations. Beyond this, there can be no further concessions. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Japanese troops moved down the Beining Railway today and occupied Xinmin. According to a public announcement by the Japanese authorities, the advance of the Japanese army was due to the fact that after the fighting at Gaotaishan yesterday, the security committee of Xinmin fled in fear, so it was necessary to enter the city to maintain order. Not counting the large detachment of troops sent from Shenyang to Juliuhe today, there are currently 130 Japanese soldiers stationed in Xinmin, and a large detachment and two companies of Japanese soldiers stationed in Juliuhe. According to the opinions of the Chinese, the Japanese army's attack on Jinzhou is expected at any time, because the Japanese military authorities want to completely eliminate any government in Manchuria that is loyal to Zhang Xueliang or Nanjing.

<p>Ma Zhanshan Firmly Refuses</p>
<p>Ma's Strength Still Sufficient</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Harbin states that Honjo sent a representative to see Ma Zhanshan, continuing to ask him to hand over the government of Heilongjiang Province to Zhang Jinghui. Ma firmly refused. Honjo's representative also tried to entice him with the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Heilongjiang Province Garrison, but Ma ignored him. However, there are many local bullies in Heihe and Harbin who have recently gone to Bu Kui to offer Duo Men plans to organize a government, which is quite unfavorable to Ma.

<p>(Harbin) Two aircraft flew to Tailai and Guchengzi today for reconnaissance. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Most of the Japanese troops in Heihe have been deployed to the Qiqihar-Keelung-Taonan lines. There are currently only over 500 troops remaining in the provincial capital, and they patrol the streets daily with armored trains and vehicles, maintaining strict control. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Heihe Autonomous Maintenance Association organized by Zhao Zhongren and others is still operating, located in the former Provincial Assembly. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Heilongjiang Provincial Government in Hailun, due to the incompleteness of provincial officials and committee members, will first establish eight departments within the provincial government: Finance, Education, Police Affairs, Political Affairs, Intelligence, Secretariat, Industry, and Military Affairs, to sort things out separately. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) According to a well-informed foreigner arriving from Harbin, Japanese officials are currently negotiating with General Ma Zhanshan to manage Heilongjiang Province under Japanese influence. Of the leaders in North Manchuria, Ma is the only one with real power. After the Battle of Qiqihar, Ma still has approximately 15,000 troops. Although Zhang Jinghui has been instigated by the Japanese, he is hesitant to go to Qiqihar because Ma Zhanshan has a large army and his own troops are not strong enough to oppose him.
