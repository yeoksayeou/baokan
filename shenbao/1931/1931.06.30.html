<h3>救災爲國民天職</h3>
<p>人類在社會上獲得安寗之幸福。莫不有頼乎互助。而此互助之心。非出於外感。而出於痛癢相關之同情。故同胞有疾苦呼籲則必披髮攖冠而往。此固良心上人人應有之同情也。我國民近來所遭之疾苦。除匪患外爲連續不斷之天災被災以外之人。皆有援救義務。且亦未嘗不努力於援救。然而災之發現旣多。區域又廣。國人援救之力。固因不暇應付而漸覺其竭。亦且因司空見慣。而漸至於膜視。夫力不逮而稍弛其救災之責猶可相諒。若因司空見慣而致淡其救災之熱心。則絕非良心上所應有。吾人對此天災之連續不斷而來。當更鼓動其互助之精神。奮起其援救之願力。而不應反望而却步。淡漠視之也。近日所謂連續不斷之天災。若晋南之旱災。湘省之水災。損失皆甚鉅大。兩省人民。正在無可呼訴之中。而其他若陜之渭南。又有蝗害發現。黑省嫩江。有水漲危險。閩垣霪雨成災。今日粤省江北。亦有水漲停車之報。蓋時當夏令。蟲害與水患。實爲應時而生之流行病。其可懼實與時疫相等。國人於此。一方宜努力於預防工作。一方如不幸而發見。則努力於救濟工作。庶乎稍盡我國民之天職也。</p>

<p>至於根本救濟方法、仍須從確定社會組織、修養人民身心、維持生活安定等事宜、積極施行、以適應民衆之急切需要、庶匪亂旣平以後、乃可逐漸恢復治安、不致時起時伏、常爲民害、故第四次全國代表大會責任、對於本黨工作之推進、與訓政時期約法之實施、所負者至爲重大、現在中央各同志、正聚精會神、以研究大會方案之議題、以謀普遍之建設、希望黨内各級同志、一致負責、準備一切材料、以待根本大計之决定、如四次代表大會得到圓滿結果、相信數年以後、定可完成總理遺敎、與本黨政策、以解除民衆痛苦、使一般民衆、對黨發生信仰、感覺不可離開、届時即是四次代表大會之成功、亦即是訓政時期建設之成功云云、報告畢、十時散會、</p>

<p>現在無論國家財政、工商業及農村經濟、均有日趨貧困之勢、而赤匪仍到處燒殺如故、這不但是政府應注全力來對付的大問題、也是人民應當注意的大問題、當知俄國標榜的所謂世界革命政策、是以擾亂世界爲目的、他完全是要利用這種騙人的政策、來打破他被包圍的形勢、而向各國進攻、所以他不惜這裏放一把火、那裏放一把火、以求逹其野心、我們中國、就是也放火的最大目的之一、</p>
<p>現在前方的蔣總司令·及諸將士、正在辛苦奮鬥、在後方和我們、應當格外努力、須知此乃革命的生死關頭、後方黨政同人、應當時時刻刻、心在前方、不可一毫懈怠、如果前方努力剿除赤匪、後方却在製造赤匪、那就是我們國民黨和國民的自殺、明白些説、後方不努力、就會給赤匪以很多機會也、我們現在爲國家·爲民族·爲世界的人類、都當萬分努力、開一條三民主義的大道、完成我們的責任、</p>

<p>江南未曾失望　中央爲中國最高學府、體育科尤占重要位置、故對於提倡體育、有獨到之眼光、雖於暑假期中、在各運動員已星散回家之際、仍毅然應諾、與江南對抗、其意蓋在决不令江南有所失望也、果然對抗結果、中央亦有數次運動占得優勝、</p>
<p>水土不服减色　江南方面、有數健將、以水土不服、身體違和、致未能參加運動、亦有勉强參加練習、而成績過步者、如曾榮忠、陳行佩、舒照賢等、且其餘諸人、亦有以暑期中長途跋涉、成績不見出色、</p>
<p>曾榮忠病腹瀉　隊中四百米健將曾榮忠、由抵寗後、即患腹瀉、或云以水土不服、後經首都名醫趙士法博士診治、據云係腹炎、但不甚劇烈、稍事調治數日後、即可復原云、</p>

<p>米雙珍案　遼陽日人以煤油冷水灌死冋敎徒米雙珍案、現交涉尙在地方上進行、未移外部辦理、外部對此、亦僅見諸報載、詳情如何、尙未確實明瞭、最近外部已電瀋詢問一切云、</p>

<h3>福佑路華陽樓主吳春芝被戳斃</h3>

<p>矮子小王突來行兇</p>
<p>昨日下午四時許、南市福佑路小世界東首滬南保衛團第九隊部對面華陽樓點心店主人吳春芝、忽被素識之友人用刀戳斃、内容甚爲複雜、茲將詳情探錄於後、</p>
<p>陳小妹之身世　有浦東女子陳小妹者、芳齡十九、貌僅中姿、而天性、異常活潑、口齒尤其伶俐、父母甚嫟愛之、父名學榮、以前曾經營雕刻木作及洋廣等業、鼎盛時代、在滬共開設店舗至四處之多、詎料陳運蹇時乖、店舖相繼閉歇、遂至一蹶不振、妻周氏、現闔家共居於浦東爛泥渡各人謀做勞工、以資度日、小妹現在法租界慷悌路福新烟草公司爲包紮香烟女工、每日清晨過浦、至廠工作、晚間最遲至翌晨二時歸家、</p>
<p>一女竟爾兩字　數載以前、小妹闔家曾一度住於南市小世界附近、約八九年之久、其時小妹年尙幼稚、乃同其母在附近洋翡翠店内習學手工、二年前、由其母作主將小妹許配與在洋翡翠店工人同鄉人混名矮子小王者爲室、文定時、得王姓禮金四十元、詎未幾王竟失業、其個人生活、尙感困難、遑論迎娶、而小妹之母、遂亦變更初衷、擅自將其母再許與浦東人名周和尙者爲室、旋於去年舊歷一月間結婚、</p>
<p>協議解决辦法　矮子小王見人財兩空、心存不甘、遂邀同友人湯根泉·陳潤生（綽號矮子才實亦在邑廟内開設鑲牙店）等與陳理論、經調解後、由陳姓還王損失洋五十元、以作了事、當時即交洋三十元、尙欠二十元、約定昨日上午十時在邑廟得意茶樓接洽、當塲由王宅調人湯根泉·陳潤生及陳宅請出向在福佑路一五四號開設華陽樓麵館之老闆吳春芝·及一與吳相識之老者、連同陳小妹等三面理楚、由陳小妹交湯等大洋十五元、一面由王之代表人湯根泉交出八字庚帖、惟當時矮子小王並未在塲、</p>
<p>麵館上呼救聲　雙方交涉明晰後、遂各散去、小妹個人即往慷悌路福新烟公司算取得工資洋一元一角、復返至福佑路華陽樓麵館、擬與吳春芝談話、詎料甫入店門、而被棄之前未婚夫矮子小王已先在、暼見小妹跚跚而來、乃亦跟踪而入、適遇吳春芝、王與吳略談數語、隨喚吳上樓密談、吳當時亦不疑有他、兩人乃拾級登樓、小妹即在樓下守候、詎兩人上樓片刻、忽聞樓上發生鬥毆聲、吳且呼救、</p>
<p>利刃滿沾血跡　吳之呼救未畢、而小王已倉皇下樓、祇見王手執六寸許之利刃一把、刀上沾滿血跡、一直奔出門外、而同時吳亦跟踪追下、擬與王相持、王見勢不妙、乃將利刃棄於路旁、飛奔逃亡無踪、迨吳追出店門、已負創不支踣地、滿身血污、隣人聞警畢集、但見吳左腹右胸受有刀傷兩處、腹部腸已流出、旋即斃命、</p>
<p>死者聽候相騐　肇事後、該處一區二分所十四號崗警高萬齡聞警趕到、奈兇手早遠颺、亟飛報到所易所長聞耗、立即親自率同長警多人、莅塲履勘一過、當將主要人陳小妹拘獲及兇刀一把連同兇手友人李楨祥一名、一併帶所、研訊一過、死者吳春芝藉隸揚中年三十一歲、華樓係與友陳禮德、合資開設者、該店係於今年一月間開設、初僅賣酒、嗣因營業不振、改設麵館、易所長訊畢、當即飭轉地保報請法院檢騐、一面通令所屬嚴緝兇犯務獲解究、</p>

<h3>吳佩孚出川之行程</h3>
<p>— 程駿崧</p>
<p>吳佩孚出川消息。喧傳已久。茲者又復寂然。其殆蜀中音訊沈滯。不易逹到耶。頃有友自成都來。爲言吳氏行踪。頗爲詳盡。爰亟誌之如下。</p>
<p>吳氏自戰事失敗後。退處川東。歲月不居。業已二載。從前壯志。銷磨殆盡。日惟蒔花讀畫而已。其凄凉境况。殆似杜少陵依嚴武時也。近以久居他人籬下。了無生趣。亟思赴蓬萊原籍休養。又以本人。成政治上過去人物。對於任何派系。均無猜忌可言。因徵得中央同意。准予出川。吳氏乃收拾行裝。携其夫人及屬僚四百餘人。於五月十三日由宣潢縣之下八廟鎭啓程。次日行抵綏定。有某君進謁。暢談之餘。並贈以親筆草書之單條一幅。上云「一年樹榖。十年樹木。百年樹人。千年樹德」等字。其下又題云。「取法乎上。僅得其中。取法乎中。僅得其下。取法乎下。則一無所得矣」。準此以觀。則吳氏之胸懷。可見一斑矣。在綏定曾盤桓數日。即於二十四日赴廣安。至二十六日始到。該處係楊森防地。沿途均由楊派員照料保護。余（友自稱）離川時。吳氏尙在該處。似未起程也。至吳氏之此後行程。聞係取道順慶潼川赴成都。再由成都赴靑城成山。轉往峨嵋。預定在峨嵋游覽十日。以窮山水之勝後。即取道嘉定·叙府·瀘州·重慶·萬縣。乘船而逹宜昌。而後經武漢過首都而來滬。至杭州西湖游歷。再返蓬萊。以時計之。如無意外阻礙。七月間當可與滬上人士握手相見矣。</p>
<p>又吾鄉每届元宵。輒有懸虎徵射之舉。有關於吳氏文電二則。與此文頗有關合。一爲吳佩孚近狀。射七唐一如今不似洛陽時。一爲吳佩孚重整旗鼓。射左傳一子至復治兵。前一則爲吳氏惋惜。凄凉欲絕。後一則預祝吳氏東山再起。然以飽經憂患之吳氏觀之。殆不復作此想也。</p>
<h3>美國報業影片開映記</h3>
<p>— 黄寄萍</p>
<p>年來吾國出版物漸興。報紙之創作。漸由都市而及於内地。新聞敎育亦稍稍爲人注意。如各大學之設報學系。組報學會。與派員出洋專研新聞學或考察報業。此誠報業前途之曙光。吾人於各國報業之發逹。類能道之。然所知者耳聞而非目睹。其實際狀况。原非身歷其境者所能洞悉。此次芝加哥講壇報駐滬記者鮑惠爾氏（兼密勒氏評報主筆）特介紹該報寫眞影片。ＦｒｋｍＴｒｅｅｓｔｏＴｒｉｂｕｎｅｓ在滬開映。與我報界相見。藉知美國報界之一斑。其盛意彌可感也。</p>
<p>該片旣運滬。鮑氏函請上海日報公會主持其事、此會爲各報之中樞、爲增進報界同人之利益、擇定二十八日上午十一時半假座南京大戲院開映、贈劵於中外各報職工通訊社廣告公司及不報界。届時到者極踴躍。中外士女約一千五百餘人。孔祥煕氏亦蒞止。或謂片中有造林造紙二節。與實業部頗有關係。孔氏之來。或即此因。開映時由申報汪英賓氏用無線電播音。首先感謝鮑氏及院主之雅意並節譯片中之大意。</p>
<p>該片分三本。第一本爲山野森林。濃蔭蔽天。工人持斧或鋸。入林伐木。切成木段。投諸溪澗。順激流而下。逹於港灣復換輸轉運。送逹該報自辦之紙廠。第二本爲造紙之程序。先用機器磨成木屑。和以化學藥品。化爲木漿。經數次之提鍊。更翻製作。而成細潔之報紙。運入報館。至納入印報機爲止。第三本爲報館内部之工作。編輯部人員衆多。工作緊張。編就之稿。送交排字房。植字亦用機械。如打字然。其他拚版打紙鑄銅版鉛版。以至印報等各部工作。神速無比。報紙印完。自動的運至發行處。報販於黎明之時。即披星戴月。紛往市場售報。另一部分由印報機直逹包裝間。亦用機械包紮。以備送局郵寄。其由舟車運輸者。均打包送往車站輪埠或航空站。觀其運輸之便利。益知交通與人生關係之密切。此報日銷百餘萬份。星期日倍之。其規模之宏大。與組織之完密。自不待言。即以該報館屋而論。四十餘層之大厦。高聳雲際。壯麗雄偉。令人起望洋興歎之感矣。</p>
<h3>火柴趣談</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>日常用之火柴。俗有稱爲洋火或自來火者。殆以斯物最初來自海外。故特加以洋字也。火柴向有紅頭與黑頭之别。黑頭較安全。非重擦不易引火。但匣中滿盛火柴之際。關蓋不密。苟取一根。在匣旁向露頭處擦過。在氣候乾燥時。稍一不愼。軏致全體着火。灼傷手指。急有手揮。亦不易脫。余友多人。均因略不經心。時遭灼膚。斯亦用火柴者所應注意者。紅頭火柴含燐至多。性更危險。近年來市上已漸少見。據英國雜誌所載。彼邦之停製紅頭头柴。内含一段軼聞。述之似頗趣也。</p>
<p>此事乃英國國會議員李德兒氏近來在公共衛生委員會演講時所述及。彼謂最初製造火生柴。富含燐質。燐之爲物。不但具猛烈之爆發性。且配合之際。易入人體内部。起燐化用。使骨骼備受侵蝕。李氏友人之一。爲定火柴製造專家。當年幼時。偶隨其父入所設之火柴工塲内遊觀。經一暗室。不禁大駭。蓋室隅坐一工人。黑暗間面部燦爛發光。狀極可怖。間之始悉工作年久。深受燐毒。舉凡面頰各骨飽吸燐質之後。莫不成此現象。因惻焉憫之。其後友繼父業。即下决心停止紅頭火柴之製造。並反復陳其弊害。藉以取得同業各家之同意。面社會經其鼓吹。亦相戒不用。一時英國市上之紅頭火柴。從此竟告絕跡云。</p>
<h3>熊成基烈士園奠基</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>江都熊成基烈士。起兵於安慶。就義於東省。已越二十年。茲由中委王柏齡等。請求中央。建議省府。在掦州瘦西湖濱關園建祠。擇於六月二十八日行奠基禮。茲覓得烈士在哈埠就捕時遺象。附以小傳以介紹於國人。</p>
<p>烈士諱成基。字味根。籍江都。南洋砲兵學堂將校科畢業。亡清光緖三十四年。烈士爲第九鎭砲營隊官。於秋操時起兵安慶。敗走桐城。出靑島。渡日本。宣統元年。至長春。改姓名爲易龍潛。字望雲。圖大舉。庽臧貫三家。臧出身馬賊。其子克明在日本與君諗。貫三屢向君圖案索詐。乃赴哈爾濱。適淸洵貝勒自歐洲歸。君將剌之於途。貫三告密。遂被捕。時民國紀元前夏曆十二月二十四日也。明年就義於吉省垣。春秋僅二十有四。柩厝於三江會館。民國二年始得歸葬江都平山堂麓。今者黨國建立。時越二十年。而謁君墓者。祇覺有芳草夕陽之感。幾忘首義時有具百折不回精神之熊烈士也。然則所以爲景行仰止者。庶有在矣。</p>
<h3>印度遊記（五七）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>論及甘地之運動。回人亦甚贊成。云頗有成績。鄉人亦能抗稅。例如鹽稅本不許貧民賣鹽。今此製已破英政府無如何。人民自由販鹽。政府難一一管理之。抗稅之事。亦各地有之。以余所知。如缅甸各地。人民均甚自由。印度亦然。蓋間接管理。頗不易周密。聞暹羅政府管理頗嚴。因直接管理故也。余見回人禁食之事。亦在各人性隔有頗認眞者。亦有不然者。余遇一學生。在園中買水菓。贈我二枚。自留二枚。問何以現今不食。答須侍晚方食之。白日禁食也。似認眞矣。而他人朝食。與我同食。可見亦未易一律矣。論及印回衝突事。蓋印律已甚高。清凈自持。不與人交通。若在中國之回敎。一向未聞有衝突之事。蓋同化矣。印度敎高潔精嚴。不但不與人通婚。亦不與人交際。蓋甚難行其拜牛之俗。任如何高尙。難推行於各地。吾敬之憐之。而難學之也。</p>
<p>印度地方太平。人民安安順。各商店並無外墻。散開布置。夜間無在門可閉。一切自由。若在中國。一步不可行。若居印度久者。性質變成和平。本市淸潔。道路寛新。與拉好同。蓋西人善治市府而不善治鄉村。此農工所以貧苦而起革命也。</p>
<p>二十一日。數學會數敎授奔内查等請吃飯。并有一法國人。法人甚柔弱。絕不如吾人理想中法人當皆如拿破侖也。奔内查夫人才學俱優。示余其爲印度之新敎派。不守古派。其有一製出銅標記。上有蓮花萬字。及阿字頂與新月形。表明爲世界大同之敎矣。此派在印度今頗流行。余語諸會員。余喜數理哲學。却不能作眞正數學之弟子。因甚畏此也。聞某處有花會陳列諸花。未得往。</p>
<p>本市有一事可紀者。則其各街旁之街名。皆作甚大字。刻於道旁是也。余經各國街道之標皆不清楚。尙不及上海南京。而本市爲特異。甚便行路者之認識。不過門牌上只有號數而無街名。仍不便耳。是日又一商家劉頌初君來邀。余見諸少年。愛讀書有思想。</p>

<h3>？？？（七）</h3>
<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>子良見伊又要纏擾着不去，着急起來了：「快些下去！。我肚子餓了淸早起來東西還沒有吃，你把粥預備好了沒有？」</p>
<p>夫人一聽，現出一副驚訝的神氣來，對丈夫看看：</p>
<p>「你要吃粥的麽？」</p>
<p>「我怎麽不要吃？」</p>
<p>「眞是奇怪！我方才在下面盛好了粥，只管呌你下去吃，你理也不理我，被我一個人把粥吃完了，你倒忽而要吃起來咧。」</p>
<p>「那末，我吃什麽？挨餓麽？」</p>
<p>子良生氣了，漲紅着面孔，肚子裏正在鳴作響？此時夫人忽然笑起來了：「哈哈！你又不是小孩子，一聽得沒有東西吃，就要生氣麽？你放心！你的親愛的夫人月如女士，决計心裏捨不得呌你餓肚子的，等娘姨回來了，再呌伊去買點心給你吃！」</p>
<p>「餅乾還有沒有？」</p>
<p>子良的火，平了一點了，夫人又是嫣然一笑：</p>
<p>「餅乾麽？只有葷的，你要不不要？」</p>
<p>「葷的？」</p>
<p>「餅乾裏出了蛀蟲，不是成了葷餅乾麽？」</p>
<p>「豈有此理！」</p>
<p>「極有滋味！」</p>
<p>夫人格格的笑，子子良旋過頭去，不理伊了。夫人便踏進一步：</p>
<p>「王老伯的訃聞上，是後天開吊，送什麽禮？</p>
<p>「輓聯！」</p>
<p>「你老是送輓聯，一副輓聯，只値四毛錢。怎麽送得出？從前我父親死了，你這位緦服子婿，也送一副輓聯」</p>
<p>子良聽得不耐煩，立起來，用手一揮：</p>

<p>漢標晨跌午回、交易所漢標前市開盤、以金價跌進六百九十兩關内、而外柨平平、致人氣軟化、各跌二·直三錢午後金價向上至七百兩外、日商亦進、各月回漲三·四錢、成計五萬Ｏ一百擔、查賣出泰興一千擔、恒德一千擔、益成一千擔、廣豐一千七百擔、買進長豐六千二百擔、協生二千百擔、廣豐一千三百擔、梅記一千一百擔、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>糧食　天陰米市轉定</h3>
<p>新聞　昨日米市、到頭稍有、約十餘號之譜、因天時不佳、早晨臨市人數不見十分踴躍、厚粳定局、頂貨尤穩、中關貨店胃漸動、主客隨市脫售、斛脚見增、形勢祇宿次微削、薄稻需要尙殷、行情喊起角許、杜埠尖時斛時停、漫無準則、綠存到兩枯、買戶已不注重、祇價格告隱而已、檽米酒作坊茶食店、二胃微動、市形坐定</p>
<p>之勢、</p>
<p>滬南　昨日各帮來源愈覺落稀、浦存不果宿貨略有、城鄉店銷仍薄、因天氣轉陰、鮮景進意略動、行胃亦覺稍開、亦因連日削落、不願再鬆、厚粳行情乃告落定、市形鮮頂堅硬、中次亦現穩定、薄稻到積雖不多、奈寗胃及本街銷塲依然淸淡、客方欲脫不易、故價又跌五分、洋杜尖乃受客尖日疲、去化僅頂料略選、中檔呆木、形勢續趨萎象、陰化銷路惟取鮮高而已、中次二種高定宿疲、</p>
<h3>粉市近遠趨勎互異</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、初平繼堅之象、以洋麥報價、互有一二角上落、金價初開踓跌、繼亦回漲、因此人心轉穩、遠期各月份兼因津營各帮、頻頻吸收、自八月份以次、步呈堅昂、尤以七月份爲更佳、因廠家停抛、業外心思自然愈俏也、迨至下午開盤、近遠間之趨勢、又大變動因本月份爲最後一日、浮多急於了結、自二兩零二分半、步步向下、最低又跌到二兩、五盤以後、稍形回振、七月份以次、因本月之故、亦見帶軟、惟聞某廠雖有收進、故呈擯局、或者此種做品、引起人心之向昂、再定抛計、亦未可知、至兵船現粉、聞實銷帮照標準抽買、普通加一分、結果本月份較前日跌一分半、七月份未動、九月份大七厘半、十月份大一分十一月份大一分二厘半云</p>
<h3>麥市未許樂觀</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面仍在逐步疲跌之中、因金價暴</p>
<p>落以來、洋麥市値甚少高昂之象、彷彿國外之麥市、尙未脫過剩時期、况乎新麥登塲後、廠胃旣寂、現麥存底、本埠已逹三四萬包、凡此情形、多頭自然心虚、更以前週幾日中、洋麥成交者已逹十萬噸左右、則麥市之未許樂觀、爲環境所不可免也、上下午各盤以多頭这反賣、市氣步跌、下午幸有紹帮之抵空、市稍擯住、結果七八月份较前週計跌六分、九月份跌四分、十月份跌三分、十一月份跌四分、現麥市况、以申廠未有去胃、一致觀望、新麥旺令之時、呈此景象、實爲歷年所罕見、全市祇寗波帮辦南京麥四百包　三兩三錢六分云、</p>
<h3>絲茶滬廠經貨缺成交難暢</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市　轉趨淸堅、綠里昂滬白廠經電報雖續有轉滬、而廠方手貨不充、成交難暢、昨祇愼昌等進上中身滬白廠經三十包、三星等進黄組絲五包價均堅穩云、</p>
<h3>婺源子茶市價趨跌</h3>
<p>婺邑子茶出新後、經號販熱烈搜辦、市價已提高至每斤七角、茶號收進、竟有出價八十元、良以本年子莊出貨甚優、細嫩香厚、頗多細貨可取、故號家均不嫌貴而樂辦、詎昨得滬電告、謂屯溪珍眉市價已倾跌五六十兩茶號興趣較因之頓淡今日子莊收進、每担已倾跌五十元、較前兩日見落二十元、仍有看跌之勢、</p>
<h3>屯溪茶市新訊</h3>
<p>屯溪茶號、自頭字新珍眉運滬得盤三百數十兩、一般茶販、因之大起搜辦、市價提高八十餘元、婺東及休專四響茶販、以屯市價高俏、紛紛將存貨運屯謀沽、近日各茶行開出市盤、仍自七十元至八十四五元、原有新舊茶號、亦均一律開塲、與上年無增减、申票售價、已見鬆跌、因茶市用洋日少、錢莊運現到湧、每千兩由一千三百四十元已落至一千三百七十餘元、店莊茶末銷場、近來大形暢逹、每担由十二元澈漲至二十八元及三十元、爲從來未有之最高紀錄、一般茶販咸改超於搜買茶末一途銷價之俏、實所罕見云</p>
<h3>疋頭元直貢呢開價益貴</h3>
<p>元靑直貢呢、日來開出市盤益大、蓋國外毛價飛漲、定價昂貴、與目下現貨價相比、適成倒掛之勢、執貨者相率喊高、队聊成本之不足、茲查本埠内外棧所存之元靑貢呢、寥寥無幾、五六兩檔子者尤爲軋缺、昨榮泰一五三三Ｏ立德圖每碼售七兩五錢半、寗豐二八八金鋼鑽七兩、安利聚賣盆七兩凈盤、天祥八八八爲六兩七錢半、德二四八八四孝圖五兩、一四四Ｏ黄天霸五兩七錢半、</p>
<h3>糖市日又復盛開</h3>
<p>太古糖亦開萬餘包</p>
<p>昨日糖市產區電訊仍乏到來、公會劃盤荷市二十四號粗砂白買氣仍寥、價仍十一兩二錢、二十號中砂白十兩Ｏ六錢半、八號荷亦九兩二錢半、市形平定、日糖交易頗、暢市且微升、「Ｎ」嘜十兩Ｏ八錢二分半至八錢半、「ＳＨ」嘜十兩Ｏ六錢至二分半、「Ｔ」嘜十一兩二錢、ＴＭ嘜十兩Ｏ七錢、ＴＫ嘜十兩Ｏ八錢半、ＹＴ嘜十兩Ｏ八錢、ＹＲＯ嘜十兩Ｏ五錢六月二五至七分半、趨勢颇頗俏、廠盤有太古糖售開七月份交貨一萬餘包、ＤＹ嘜價日金四元五角、ＣＷ嘜四元六角、Ｂ嘜四元七角、ＨＸ嘜四元四角、ＨＭ嘜四元二角、明治糖續開九月份一萬包、ＹＴ嘜價四元五角、中央廠開出八九月份ＡＲＡＥ對搭扯價四元六角、後更以九月份續開三千包價仍原盤大里糖亦後一萬五千包、「Ｎ」嘜價四元六角、「Ｔ」嘜四元八角市則較平抛貨荷糖有求新廠售開八月份裝船八號貨荷赤一百噸、價荷幣五元一角十號一百噸、價五元二角七分、需要殊靜、南盛隆售開七月份八號荷數十噸、價荷幣五元Ｏ七分半、均係新規加稅、市形較爲俏秀也、</p>
<h3>南北貨龍口粉到稀價升</h3>
<p>龍口線粉於日前到過千餘件、惟其中有大半係轉往他處者、此間各行自辦及客貨爲數僅有五百餘件、而客盤甚緊、昨聞已有開出、價爲二十三兩、較前升起兩許故行盤因亦隨緊、云</p>
<h3>五金法西釘新貨裝到</h3>
<p>法西釘本地存貨寥少、早誌本報、惟購者衆多、以致求交之稍緩者、大都無貨可購、前昨二日新貨裝到不少、如公和祥·三菱諸棧各有二三千桶裝到、故買戶方面、聆此消息、均各分頭採辦、聞出已有一千三百餘桶之多、行情每桶爲九兩錢半、查購戶統係長江帮居多數云、</p>
<h3>英鋼板動銷靑烟帮</h3>
<p>五金交易、近因實銷淡漠、市象仍無生色、惟久處冷落之英鋼板、昨日趨勢、緣靑烟諸帮紛紛收辦、致市情十分熱閙、行情絡繹加漲二三錢不等如二厘半每擔估價八兩七錢半、半分七兩、七厘半六兩七錢半、一分六兩二錢半、分半以上統售六兩、調查昨日靑島·烟台各帮辦去共有八九百擔之多、此外長江·天津諸帮點綴亦奸、是以來趨况、甚許樂觀也、</p>

<p>Important Domestic Telegrams</p>
<h3>Chiang Plans to Inspect the Front Lines</h3>
<p>A Letter to the Magistrate of Gan County</p>
<p>The Red Bandits are Shrinking Their Territory</p>
<p>Lai Xinhui and Others Arrive in Gan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Nanchang, 29th - (1) Headquarters reports that Chiang plans to personally inspect the front lines in a week. (2) Zhao Guantao has submitted a plan for suppressing the bandits to Chiang, which is very detailed. Chiang has handed it over to the General Staff for detailed study and adoption.

He himself will personally inspect the front lines to observe the political achievements.

<h3>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Memorial Week, Fan Guang Reports on Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>The Sino-Turkish Treaty is Largely Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Our Country is Proceeding with the League of Nations Council</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Fan Guang reported at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' memorial week on the morning of the 29th. (1) Regarding the recovery of the French Concession in Shanghai, the content of the agreement has been completely agreed upon after several days of consultations between representatives of both sides. It can be recovered after it is signed and takes effect. (2) Regarding the recovery of concessions, the points advocated in the report of lawyer Fei Tang regarding the Shanghai Public Concession are contrary to the wishes of the Chinese government and people. The conclusion that the return of the Shanghai concession is a matter of decades, not years, is regrettable. The National Government has a set policy on the recovery of concessions and will not be interrupted or retreat due to external opinions. (3) Treaty Matters: Regarding the Sino-Turkish treaty matter, three meetings were held last week and progress was smooth. The Turkish envoy has come to Beijing three times within a year, holding more than ten meetings. After this meeting, except for two or three points that the envoy needs to ask his government for instructions on, the rest has been resolved. After the instructions are received from his country, it can be signed. The envoy plans to return to his country at the end of the month and will depart after signing. (4) League of Nations Affairs: The 12th regular meeting of the League of Nations has been scheduled to be held in September this year. Our country can have a deciding vote on the non-permanent council seat this year, but our country is still seeking a permanent council seat and is currently making efforts to proceed.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief is a National Duty</h3>
<p>The happiness of peace and tranquility that mankind obtains in society relies on mutual assistance. And this heart of mutual assistance does not come from external influences, but from empathy for shared pain. Therefore, when fellow citizens have suffering and appeals, they must rush to help. This is indeed a sympathy that everyone should have in their conscience. The suffering that our people have recently encountered, in addition to banditry, is the continuous natural disasters. People who are not affected by the disaster all have the duty to help, and they have never failed to work hard to help. However, since there are many disasters and the area is wide, the people's ability to help has gradually become exhausted due to being unable to cope, and they have gradually become indifferent due to familiarity. It is forgivable to slightly relax the responsibility of disaster relief due to insufficient strength. If the enthusiasm for disaster relief fades due to familiarity, then it is definitely not what one should have in their conscience. When we face this continuous natural disaster, we should further encourage the spirit of mutual assistance, arouse the willingness to help, and not retreat or be indifferent. Recently, the so-called continuous natural disasters, such as the drought in southern Shanxi and the floods in Hunan Province, have caused great losses. The people of the two provinces are in a state of despair. In addition, there is a locust plague in Weinan, Shaanxi. There is a danger of rising water in the Nen River in Heilongjiang. Continuous rain in Minyuan has caused disasters. Today, there is also a report of rising water and traffic stoppage in northern Guangdong Province. In the summer season, insect pests and floods are indeed seasonal epidemics. The fear is actually equal to that of seasonal diseases. In this regard, the people of the country should strive to prevent work on the one hand, and strive for relief work if it is unfortunately discovered, so as to fulfill the national duty of our people.</p>

<h3>Contents of Belgian and Greek Replies to the United States</h3>
<p>Heavy Sacrifices in the European War</p>
<p>Belgium Insists on Continued Payment of Mark Annuities</p>
<p>Greek Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>Requests Guarantee for Losses Incurred Due to Debt Suspension</p>
<p>(Brussels, 28th) The Belgian reply to US President Hoover's debt suspension plan has been released, stating that although Belgium has suffered enormous losses in the European War, it is still willing to continue to make sacrifices for the sake of the public good. However, in terms of justice, Belgium's sacrifices should not be heavier than those of Germany. Therefore, Belgium requests that the previously agreed Mark Agreement, concerning the banknotes issued when German troops occupied Belgium, should not be suspended altogether due to the debt suspension. However, if Germany cannot repay in cash, it can repay in goods, and although Belgium knows that its domestic industry will be hit hard, it must painfully accept it. It is said that Belgium's reply is very important, as several difficulties may be easily resolved as a result. Although Germany's treasury may not be able to bear a slightly lighter burden, the number of unemployed people in the country may be slightly reduced because goods can be used to replace cash.</p>
<p>(Athens, 28th) The Greek government has sent a reply to the US debt suspension plan, stating that Greece is very willing to cooperate with all countries to alleviate the suffering of the world economy, but Greece itself is in financial difficulty and cannot bear heavier sacrifices.

<h3>Spanish Parliamentary Election Situation</h3>
<p>Republicans and Socialists Take the Lead</p>
<p>Minor Conflicts in Elections Throughout</p>
<p>Catalonia Province Tends to Declare Independence</p>
<p>Attempted Uprising by the Tablada Air Force Fails</p>
<p>(Madrid, 29th, Reuters) According to known election results, the Republican-Socialist coalition, on which the Spanish provisional government is based, has won a complete victory. Official figures are not yet available, but according to news from Barcelona, the Macià party (i.e., autonomists) have won 42 of the 52 seats that Catalonia Province should have in the new parliament. It is said that Catalonia is very excited and may declare Catalonia Province a republic. If so, the future may be troublesome. Six people died in election conflicts in various places. It is also reported that Franco has been elected as a member of parliament for Barcelona. Spanish Prime Minister Zamora has also been elected. The Republican-Socialist Party won in most provinces.</p>
<p>(Madrid, 28th) Today, Spain and its territories simultaneously elected 467 members of the constitutional assembly, hoping to convene in Madrid this month to formulate a new constitution for the republic. Voters voted from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, but the results will not be revealed until Tuesday. The country was generally peaceful during the election, with only minor disturbances in a few places, with Barcelona being the most serious, where four people died due to riots. The election results do not pose any threat to the republic. Although the various republican parties are divided into gradual and radical factions, they united to conduct the election. The imperialists did not openly campaign beforehand, but they proceeded separately during today's voting, with some abandoning voting, some re-electing independent candidates without party affiliation, some supporting non-political religious organizations, and others turning to support the conservative faction of the Republican Party. Their forces are scattered, so the abdication of the Spanish king can be regarded as a confirmed fact, with no hope of restoration.</p>
<p>(Madrid, 28th, Reuters) Officials have learned that the Tablada Air Force rebelled, intending to declare a Soviet republic in Andalusia. Troops have now been sent to guard the room where Franco, the leader of the rebellion, is ill. According to officials, Franco's party obtained 600 hand grenades and sky bombs from the Seville government's Hyogo territory under the pretext of going to Morocco for exercises. Franco also claimed that if anyone disrupted his plan, he would bombard the Seville Bank Administration Office, military camps, and other places with bombs. However, the government received a warning and was able to stop the chaos in advance.</p>

<h3>Spain Intends to Abandon Morocco's Interests</h3>
<p>Rumors Circulating in Geneva</p>
<p>(Geneva, 29th, National News Agency) There are renewed rumors within the League of Nations that Spain is eager to abandon its interests in northern Moroccan territory. It is claimed that the Spanish government has approached the League of Nations Mandates Commission to explore its attitude towards the transfer of the Moroccan protectorate to the Commission. The Spanish government believes that the colony is a major burden on the treasury, and despite the huge amounts of money and bloodshed it has invested, it has no hope of receiving compensation in the short term, so it intends to give it up. However, France and Italy are currently coveting the land. If this move is indeed true, it is feared that it will cause a major dispute.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Central and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Shao Yuanchong Reports on the Mission of the National Congress</p>
<p>Yu Youren Reports on the Issue of Suppressing the Communist Bandits</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on June 29th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 118th weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in the auditorium. Central Committee members Shao Yuanchong, Zhu Peide, Ding Weifen, Zhu Jiayi, Fang Juehui, and Miao Peicheng, along with staff from various departments and invited guests, totaling around 500 people, were present. Zhu Peide presided over the ceremony. After the formalities, Shao Yuanchong reported that the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee resolved to convene the Fourth National Congress on October 10th of this year. The major missions of this National Congress are: (1) to reorganize party affairs and determine the direction of work facilities; (2) to consistently undertake and implement the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage formulated by the National Assembly, in order to achieve its provisions. Of particular importance in the Provisional Constitution are: (1) local self-government; (2) national education; (3) the people's livelihood. In the past, due to the lack of construction of local self-government, all local systems were scattered and fundamentally disorganized, allowing local tyrants, evil gentry, and unscrupulous elements to lurk within, cultivate their power, and rise up to plot disturbances whenever there was an opportunity. Furthermore, due to the lack of widespread local education, public thought was chaotic, unable to distinguish between obedience and rebellion, and unable to discern good from evil, easily falling prey to the incitement and deception of rioters, blindly following and echoing them. Moreover, due to the unresolved problem of the people's livelihood, the people suffered from the pain of economic oppression, often willingly exploited by rioters, taking risks and engaging in unlawful activities. The rampant activities of the communist bandits in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi and the failure to swiftly suppress them were primarily due to the failure to address the aforementioned three issues, leading to the nation having no peace and the people having no means of livelihood. Now that disaster is overwhelming, the influence of politics has been exhausted, and the dignity of the law has been lost, it is necessary to resolve the situation militarily, using force to quell the great turmoil.</p>
<p>As for fundamental relief measures, it is still necessary to actively implement measures such as establishing social organization, cultivating the people's minds and bodies, and maintaining the stability of life, in order to meet the urgent needs of the people. Only then, after the bandit rebellion is quelled, can public order be gradually restored, preventing recurring disturbances and constant harm to the people. Therefore, the responsibility of the Fourth National Congress for the promotion of the Party's work and the implementation of the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage is extremely significant. Currently, all comrades in the Central Committee are concentrating on studying the topics of the National Congress's proposals in order to seek universal construction. It is hoped that all levels of comrades within the Party will be jointly responsible and prepare all materials to await the determination of fundamental plans. If the Fourth National Congress achieves satisfactory results, it is believed that in a few years, the legacy of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and the Party's policies can be fulfilled, relieving the people's suffering and enabling the general public to develop faith in the Party and feel unable to leave it. That will be the success of the Fourth National Congress and the success of construction during the Period of Political Tutelage, and so on. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM after the report.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held a weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, attended by Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, Liu Shangqing, Ma Fuxiang, Li Shuhua, Chen Qicai, He Yaozu, Ru Yuli, Lin Xiang, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Ge Jingen, Zhou Yawei, Wu Siyu, and over 200 staff from the National Government's civil affairs, military affairs, accounting, and other departments. Yu Youren presided over the ceremony. After the formalities, Yu Youren reported on the issue of suppressing the communist bandits, stating that the current rampant activities of the communist bandits are indeed a major problem for our nation and people, and the government is determined to concentrate all its efforts to solve it. Commander-in-chief Chiang Kai-shek has therefore personally gone to the front lines, because if the communist bandits are not eliminated, political and economic progress will be impossible, and the Provisional Constitution promulgated by the National Assembly cannot be implemented. Everyone knows that peace and unity are prerequisites for construction, and the communist bandits are the biggest obstacle to peace and unity. In recent years, foreign imperialists and unawakened warlords at home have repeatedly undermined our revolutionary construction, creating opportunities for the communist bandits. Our strength has been almost entirely used to deal with these problems, so there has not been much progress in construction. The people are dissatisfied with the government, probably because they do not understand the facts. It must be understood that the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's principles are the principles to save China, and the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's methods are the methods to save China. The communist bandits' policy of violence cannot save China. It is hoped that the people will trust us, and we will certainly rely on the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's principles and methods to save China.</p>
<p>Currently, whether it is national finance, industry and commerce, or the rural economy, there is a trend of increasing poverty, while the communist bandits continue to burn and kill everywhere. This is not only a major problem that the government should focus all its efforts on dealing with, but also a problem that the people should pay attention to. It should be known that Russia's so-called world revolution policy is aimed at disrupting the world. It wants to completely use this deceptive policy to break through its besieged situation and attack various countries, so it does not hesitate to set fires here and there in order to achieve its ambitions. Our China is one of the biggest targets of its arson.</p>
<p>Now, Commander-in-chief Chiang Kai-shek and the generals and soldiers at the front are fighting hard, and we in the rear should work even harder. It must be known that this is a critical moment for the revolution. Comrades in the Party and government in the rear should always have their hearts on the front lines and not be negligent in the slightest. If the front lines are working hard to suppress the communist bandits, while the rear is creating communist bandits, that is the suicide of our Nationalist Party and our people. To put it bluntly, if the rear does not work hard, it will give the communist bandits many opportunities. We must now work hard for the country, for the nation, and for the human race, to open up a great road of the Three Principles of the People and fulfill our responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Relief Measures for the 20th Year Budget</h3>
<p>The National Government Issued Instructions to All Agencies to Comply</p>
<p>On the 27th, the National Government instructed all directly subordinate agencies, stating that in order to comply with the matter, the Accounting Department of the National Government previously submitted a report on the 20th year budget, stating that because the submissions from various agencies were incomplete, it was impossible to announce it as scheduled, and proposed four temporary relief measures, requesting review and approval and forwarding to the Central Political Conference for discussion and implementation, etc. The National Government then forwarded it for review and discussion. Now, the Central Political Conference has replied, stating that the resolution of the 277th meeting was to proceed as planned, and the case was recorded and communicated. It is hoped that you will investigate and separately instruct compliance with the attached measures.</p>

<h3>All Entertainment Venues in Changsha Are Closed</h3>
<p>The Municipal Office Forcibly Collects Entertainment Tax</p>
<p>The Entire Drama Industry Holds a Large-Scale Petition</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: There are 11 movie theaters in Changsha City, including Far East, Pingping, Baihe, YMCA, etc. There is one Peking opera theater, Dihua; five Cantonese opera theaters: Xiangchun, Jingxing, Jixiang, Xinwutai, Far East; and only one modern drama theater, Changsha. The highest ticket price is only 30 cents, and the lowest is only 16 copper coins. Business is not very developed. Guo Fangrui, the head of the Changsha Municipal Preparatory Office, studied in France under the work-study program and has only been in office for two months. His first policy was to petition the provincial government to collect a 10% entertainment tax to subsidize the education expenses of elementary schools in Changsha City. The 174th regular meeting of the provincial government resolved to approve the collection, but the tax rate was reduced to 5%. Director Guo then notified all entertainment venues that it would be implemented from June 1st, tasking each theater with collecting and remitting the tax when selling tickets. The theaters agreed to support the tax collection since the funds were to be taken from the audience, and the theaters would not suffer any losses. However, they felt that the tax collection was too meticulous, involving the rounding of fractions and zeroing of totals, and the procedures were cumbersome. They requested that the government directly send personnel to collect the tax from the audience at each theater instead of them acting as the agents. Director Guo did not agree and ordered each theater to deduct 5 yuan of entertainment tax for every 100 yuan of business income each day. The theaters believed that this method, ostensibly collected from the audience, was actually deducted from the theater owners. The theaters had already paid business tax, police licensing fees, stamp tax, etc., which amounted to a large sum. Adding another burden was beyond their ability. Therefore, they unanimously opposed it and requested that the government still directly collect the tax. If they were required to be responsible for collecting the tax, they requested a reduction in the tax rate. After several exchanges of official documents and negotiations, the final result was that Director Guo still insisted on his collection proposal, but allowed old-style operas to actually pay 3%, with 2% as a collection fee, and movies to actually pay 4%, with 1% as a collection fee.</p>
<p>The theater owners felt that the amount of tax was too fractional and could not be collected from the audience. Since the theater owners were to bear the burden, they requested that it be changed to a package deal, with each theater paying a certain amount of entertainment tax per month based on its business size, in order to save all the trouble. Unexpectedly, Director Guo not only insisted on not agreeing but also sent troops to close all entertainment venues in Changsha City at 6:00 PM on the 25th, posting a notice at the entrance of each theater stating, "Notice: According to the order of the Hunan Provincial Department of Construction, the case of collecting entertainment tax to subsidize the education expenses of elementary schools in the urban area has been resolved by the 174th regular meeting of the Provincial Government Committee, and it has been approved to collect 5% of the ticket price of entertainment venues. It has been approved to start collecting on June 1st and a notice has been issued ordering the theater to comply. However, each tax collector reported that the theater made excuses and refused to collect the tax. The above situation was reported to the Department of Construction for instructions, and an order was received to strictly enforce it. Yesterday, a recorded order was forwarded. Despite repeated orders, the theater still deliberately held back and made excuses, which is extremely contemptuous. It should be immediately sealed off together with the military police and await verification."</p>
<p>That night, the Changsha City Drama Industry Association held an emergency meeting, attended by more than 1,000 male and female members. The following resolutions were made: (1) At 12:00 AM on the 26th, all members would gather and petition the Party and government agencies, explaining that the people only have the obligation to pay taxes and not the right to collect taxes for the government. They would still request the government to directly collect the entertainment tax, quickly lift the closure, and restore business in order to maintain the livelihoods of thousands of people. (2) Issue a declaration asking all sectors to uphold justice. (3) Schedule a meeting with the press to report on the progress of the situation and ask for assistance. It is still unknown how this matter will be resolved. (June 26)</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Litigation Case Between Jinan Telephone Company and Japanese Merchant</h3>
<p>Telephone Company Wins, East Development Loses</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In the case of the litigation between the Jinan Telephone Company and the Japanese merchant East Development Co., Ltd. over debt, the Jinan District Court of First Instance made a two-tiered judgment: (1) ordered the Telephone Company to compensate East Development 420,000 Japanese yen; (2) granted a provisional attachment of the Telephone Company's assets. The Telephone Company was dissatisfied and appealed to the Shandong Higher Court in two tiers. The Higher Court believed that this case concerned the transportation sovereignty of the entire Jinan City internally and extraterritoriality externally. A slight error in the trial would have a significant impact. Therefore, it was extremely cautious. After half a year, the judgment was made a few days ago, also in two tiers: (1) East Development's request for a provisional disposition of the Telephone Company's assets was rejected; (2) East Development's request for the Telephone Company to repay 420,000 Japanese yen was also rejected. East Development lost the case, and the Telephone Company won. The case was completely resolved. The main text of the Higher Court's judgment is recorded as follows: The original judgment regarding the defendant, Jinan Telephone Company, being jointly and severally liable to compensate the plaintiff, Japanese yen, principal and interest, totaling 420,000 yen, and bearing the costs of litigation, is hereby changed. The appellant's claim in the first instance regarding the foregoing is dismissed. The appellant's application for provisional execution is dismissed. The costs of the second instance litigation shall be borne by the appellant.</p>
<h3>Han Bandit Peng Ruiting Arrested for Impersonating a Military Commander</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Peng Ruiting, a bandit from the junction of northern Xuzhou and southern Shandong, has been causing trouble in the Hanzhuang area. Chen Shaohan's department of the 42nd Regiment of the 7th Division, stationed in Hanzhuang, had conducted strict investigations but failed to capture him. Unexpectedly, after the bandit suppression in southern Shandong, Peng Bandit could not hide his tracks in Han, so he had a whim and came to Xuzhou posing as a brigade commander of the guard army, using the alias Peng Guangzhu, and staying at the Fulai Inn on Er Malu in the eastern railway station. Chen Xueshun, the director of the Xuzhou Military and Police Supervision Office, initially received a report from Chen Chuanjing, the second battalion commander of the 42nd Regiment, requesting his arrest, and then received a report from the machine gun company of the 42nd Regiment that a false military officer, Peng Guangzhu, was hiding in Xuzhou. He also received a report from the Fulai Inn that a fake military officer was staying there. Therefore, on the evening of the 25th, he sent a team to arrest him. Peng Ruiting was captured on the spot, and a private seal, three passports, one travel permit, three lieutenant colonel symbols, and three lieutenant symbols were confiscated. He was escorted to the office. After interrogation, it was confirmed that Peng Guangzhu was indeed the alias of the Han bandit Peng Ruiting. The evidence has been collected, and the bandit has been sent to the garrison headquarters for interrogation. (28th)</p>
<h3>Cai Guo Jingluan Has Taken the Remains of the May 3rd Martyrs to the Capital</h3>
<p>Oppose the Temporary Burial of the Remains of the May 3rd Martyrs</p>
<p>Jinan Quick Dispatch on the 27th: The excavation of the backyard of the former Japanese Concession in Jinan, which uncovered the remains and clothing of the martyrs who died in the May 3rd Incident after being cremated by the Japanese, has attracted great attention at home and abroad. The Preparatory Committee for the Commemoration of the Martyrs of the May 3rd Incident resolved at its sixth meeting on the 26th to place the remains of the martyrs in magnetic jars for temporary burial. An engineer was also assigned to survey the site of the martyrs' tomb, and Zhang Honglie, the director of the Department of Construction, was tasked with designing the construction. However, Guo Jingluan, the wife of Cai Gongshi, did not agree with this method. Therefore, at 10:35 AM today (the 27th), she took the 201st Pingpu train from Jinan back to Shanghai, packing the remains of the martyrs into a large leather suitcase and carrying it with her. The suitcase had already been tagged, but Mrs. Cai was afraid of losing it, so she took it back and kept it by her side. By the time the local authorities in Shandong learned of this, the train had already departed and could not be stopped.</p>
<p>In front of the building of the Concession, the people listed from right to left were: (1) Li Jiangqiu, a journalist stationed in Jinan; (2) Mrs. Guo Jingluan; (3) Xin Changsheng, a worker at the Concession who escaped at the same time as the late martyr Cai Gongshi; and the rest were excavators. The one standing tall was the excavator. The jar contained the remains and clothing of the martyrs excavated.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Rice Shuangzhen Case in Liaoning</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Japanese police in the Japanese-affiliated land in Liaoning County灌死回民米雙珍Case, after Liaoyang County negotiated with the Japanese side and提出懲兇賠償The Japanese side has always been reluctant to admit their fault, which has aroused public outrage in Liaoyang and organized a support association. Muslims are even more indignant. The Qingzhen Church has held several meetings to discuss response measures and urge the county authorities to negotiate seriously. All sectors in Shenyang have also been speaking out in support of this case. In order to be cautious, the Liaoyang District Court Prosecutor's Office especially took 100 grams of liquid from the lungs of Rice's body when Dr. Wei Chenguang (English) of the Liaoyang Official Hospital dissected Rice's corpse, put it in a bottle and sealed it, and sent it to the Liaoning Higher Court Prosecutor's Office a few days ago, which transferred it to the Xiaoheyan Shi Hospital for detailed chemical tests. After the doctor's chemical test, it proved that it was indeed a mixture of cold water and kerosene, and there were no tuberculosis bacteria in it. The doctor issued an appraisal report and returned the original test object to the High Inspection Office, which reported the situation to the provincial government and asked it to transfer it to the Diplomatic Commissioner's Office to negotiate seriously with the Japanese side. The Liaoning National Diplomacy Association believed that the case was related to people's lives and sent Zhu Huanjie, a cadre of the association, to Liaoyang to conduct an on-site investigation to clarify the truth. Zhu returned on the 24th and told reporters that Rice Shuangzhen had been running a beef shop in the Liaoyang affiliated land, with a small capital and was self-sufficient. He was also very upright in his daily life. Because a Japanese woman, Ms. Onishi, lived in the same courtyard, who made a living by lending money at high interest rates, and had been out collecting debts for several days, the Japanese police suspected that Rice had harmed her and sent her to the police station to force a confession. Rice naturally could not admit it because he really did not know anything about it. The Japanese police then used vicious means to pour kerosene into Rice's mouth and nose, injuring his lungs and killing him. The Japanese police, because there was no real confession, caused a human life and falsely claimed that Rice died of lung disease and ordered his family to take the corpse back. Rice's family then reported to the Chinese official. After the county government sent personnel to the scene to examine the corpse, they could not prove the cause of death, so they ordered his family to hold a burial ceremony according to Islamic rites. They then sent the corpse to the hospital for dissection and saw that one lobe of the deceased's lung was swollen and one lobe was shrunken. Although an examination was carried out at the time, it was not possible to determine the cause of death. Now it has been completely proven, and the case is clear. The Japanese side should be fully responsible for Rice's death. It is also heard that Ms. Onishi returned once a few days after Rice's death, and then disappeared. It is thought that the Japanese side had ordered her to hide or send her far away for fear of causing our side's accusation. (June 24)</p>
<h3>The Murderer of Xuehua Commits Suicide in Harbin</h3>
<p>Fan Xusui Throws Himself into the River and Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Seven Pawn Tickets Were Found Beside Him</p>
<p>Harbin Communication on the 24th: The case of the brutal murder of the prostitute Xuehua in the Daiwa Hotel has been under strict investigation by police detectives day and night. It is generally believed that Fan has no sufficient travel funds and no sufficient time. He is still hiding in this port. Therefore, the search for him at his relatives and friends is very strict. On the 24th of this month, the Songhua River Water Rescue Team discovered a male corpse in the river and pulled it to the shore. After police verification, it was the fugitive criminal Fan Xusui who had been arrested. He had committed suicide in fear of crime. The discovery of the corpse was due to the fact that the iron pipe of the river channel in the Daoli Toutou Street Tongjiangbin Waterway, which discharges sewage, was suddenly blocked. Workers from the Naval River Transportation Office were working early in the morning and heard a sound and suspected something. Several people went to investigate and suddenly saw that the end of the iron pipe draining water was blocked by a corpse. They reported it to the Special City Water Rescue Team, which rescued it and dragged it to the shore. Afterwards, Tian Xiuzhi, a patrol officer from the Jiangqiao East Police Station, came to investigate and saw that his appearance was similar to the fugitive criminal Fan Xusui who was wanted by the Second Office. He then told the Second Office, which verified that it was correct and transferred it to the Municipal First Hospital in the afternoon and placed it in the mortuary with the victim Xuehua. After the examination, it will be buried. Fan was wearing a blue silk long gown, green western-style trousers, and yellow leather shoes when he died. There were 20 yuan of banknotes, a watch, and seven pawn tickets in his pocket. The dates of his pledges were not very long. His body was not damaged by water. Therefore, it is generally speculated that Fan killed Xuehua because he had no hope for the future and because he had spent too much money and could not continue. He was angry and killed Xuehua. After Xuehua's death, he could not escape, so he threw himself into the river on the evening of the 22nd, so the corpse was not rotten. As for the deceased Xuehua, her parents and a younger brother and sister are still alive. Their daily support depended on Xuehua. Now that she has been killed, her parents are crying in grief and almost do not want to live.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Commerce telegraphed the National Government, stating, "This association's third executive committee proposed and reported in the newspapers that various provinces will set up tobacco prohibition bureaus to specifically manage tobacco prohibition affairs. The harm of opium has been deep, harming the people and weakening the country. Premier Sun Yat-sen's instructions are clear, and the National Assembly's proposals are indignant. Our government and the people should identify tobacco as a common enemy. This time, the Central Anti-Smoking Committee sent members to set up bureaus in various provinces in the name of prohibition and investigation. In terms of semantics, merchants dare not have any objections, but the measures taken by the previous tobacco prohibition bureau were clearly disguised as public sales. The lessons are not far away. Our merchants are in pain and cannot help but be frightened. We dare to contribute to the responsibility of the common people. We respectfully ask your government to adopt a resolute proposal to completely prohibit toxins so as not to plunge our people into a catastrophic situation. All so-called prohibitions on the levy of taxes and all types of stamp transportation licenses and public inhalation are prohibited. We earnestly ask you to eliminate and cut off all similar situations. Furthermore, the governments of various provinces should be responsible for the positive progress of this important anti-smoking policy. There is no need to set up another bureau to cause public suspicion and fear of repeating the past. Is it appropriate? We await your inspection and implementation."</p>

He was once arrested in Shanghai by Fan Zicheng, the captain of the First Water Police Team, and sent to the Minhang District headquarters for preliminary interrogation. He was then sent to the Songjiang Command Headquarters for further investigation. The bandit confessed that he had never engaged in legitimate work and had escaped from prison in Songjiang in the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926) to return home, where he gathered accomplices and engaged in robbery everywhere. He then joined Taibao Ashu's unit, plotting to rob Taozhuang, and admitted to committing numerous major crimes. Commander Cao, based on the confession, reported to the province for instructions.

Wu Yinzhou and other women who were kidnapped from the former Heshangbang were also rescued at the same time and have safely returned home.</p>
<p>Robbery and Injury in Liuxia Township: Zhu Shengsheng, a farmer in Liuxia Township, Twelfth District, is usually frugal and has some savings, which attracted the attention of bandits. The night before last, more than ten bandits carrying weapons and speaking with a Hakka accent broke down the door and entered, tying up men and women, ransacking boxes and cabinets, and searching extensively. They also used fire to burn the victim, forcing him to reveal the location of hidden silver. As a result, they robbed fourteen shi of white rice and miscellaneous items of clothing, with an estimated loss of over 300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Two Hundred Tu: Robbery and Injury: In the Two Hundred Tu area of the county, a farmer named Wang Guiquan sold two oxen yesterday, receiving more than 200 yuan. However, he was targeted by bandits. That night, six or seven bandits speaking with a local accent broke down the door and entered, tying up Wang Guiquan's entire family, young and old, with lead wire. They also stabbed Guiquan five times, forcing him to reveal the location of hidden silver. They robbed more than 200 yuan in silver dollars.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>It is Difficult to Stop the Collection of Sutra Recitation Donations: The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously submitted the case of the Buddhist Association's request to stop collecting sutra recitation donations to the Provincial Political Affairs Conference. It was agreed that the education funds of various counties in Jiangsu Province are mostly insufficient. Therefore, the implementation of sutra recitation donations can be used to subsidize them. If they are suddenly ordered to stop, it will affect education, which is no small matter. They should separately raise funds to maintain education. However, the situations in each county are different, and the methods of compensation are difficult to standardize. It was resolved to order each county to immediately convene the Finance and Education Bureaus to properly devise compensation methods and submit them for review and transfer. Those that have not yet implemented sutra recitation donations will not be allowed to implement them again. Yesterday, the county government received the provincial order to comply and was required to report the annual donation amount of Wuxi's sutra recitation donations for record.</p>
<p>Record of Interrogation of Private Production of Inferior Silkworm Eggs: Wei Zhizhong, the former director of the Tian Shang Shi Qian Administrative Bureau, was found to be privately producing inferior silkworm eggs. Li Songwen, a local villager, wrote to the Sericulture Suppression Office to investigate, and it was confirmed to be true. Wei Heyuan, who produced the eggs, as well as many inferior eggs, were handed over by the Thirteenth Branch of the Public Security Bureau to the county government for interrogation. Yesterday, County Magistrate Pan sent police to escort Wei Zhizhong, Wei Heyuan, and Wei Peiqi, along with the evidence, to the county. The court immediately opened to question them. Wei Zhizhong claimed that he did not privately produce inferior eggs. Last year, he gathered shares to organize the Sanyou Egg Production Farm, which was solely operated by Wei Heyuan. He did not inquire about the private production matters. Wei Peiqi's statement was similar. Wei Heyuan said that the egg production farm was rented from Zhizhong and Peiyuan. After the sale was poor, it was closed down. The silkworm eggs searched this time were used for his own breeding. The lead ring was also left over from last year. County Magistrate Pan, based on the confession, said that Wei Heyuan admitted to privately producing eggs in the Public Security Bureau, so how could he deny it? He immediately ordered him to be sent to prison. Wei Zhizhong and Wei Peiqi were temporarily released on bail by the shopkeeper, pending investigation and handling.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of the Rice Market: The rice market in Xidi gradually rose one month ago, with a great upward trend.

The current market price of rough japonica rice is 3.5 yuan per shi, and white japonica rice is 10.08 yuan, which is two yuan less than the peak price. According to a recent survey of rice storage, there are 500,000 shi of japonica rice, 300,000 shi of indica rice, and more than 100,000 shi of rough indica, white indica, and rough japonica rice. Although the amount of storage is not very large, there is no way out. All rice merchants are worried.</p>

Passengers on the ship were panicked, so they stopped the ship and tried to salvage the body, but it took a long time.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Maidservant with the Surname Xi Commits Suicide by Poison: Xi Yunzhong, residing at No. 27 Tonghe Bridge Alley, Datian'an, outside the South Gate of this county, employed a maidservant named Tao Damei from Hupu. Tao is currently 22 years old and quite beautiful. Damei was originally at Miss Xi's for three years. Later, she became acquainted with Lao San, the second son of Yunzhong. Later, Yunzhong ordered Damei to pretend to smoke opium and had a relationship with Damei. Gao, the wife of Lao San, heard about this, but she could not do anything because she was favored by her mother-in-law. As a result, Damei became more powerful. On the 27th of this month, due to a minor matter of cooking meat, Damei was scolded by Gao and told Yunzhong, but he did not help her. Damei was very angry and quietly swallowed opium to commit suicide. At that time, the Xi family thought that this was the result of Gao's scolding, and everyone made things difficult for her. The matter was leaked out, and neighbors came to watch. However, the Xi family was afraid that the matter would escalate and immediately closed the gate to reject visitors. On the one hand, they wanted to lock Gao's feet to the corpse. Fortunately, Gao escaped through the side door. Knowing that the matter could not be concealed, the Xi family reported to the family of the maidservant and came to the city to discuss. They falsely claimed that she died suddenly from Sha fever. On the other hand, they also reported to the place and requested an examination. They waited for the family of the corpse to come to the city to discuss using money and a generous burial for the deceased as conditions. The family of the corpse then requested the county to waive the examination, but Shen Cheng, the reviewer of the county government, was afraid of repeating the Ximen murder case and rejected it. On the one hand, he still telegraphed Dr. Xie Tang to accompany Shen Cheng, the reviewer, to the corpse site outside the South Gate at 9:00 PM for examination. As a result, Dr. Xie examined and found that the deceased had indeed died from smoking opium before her death. He ordered the Xi family to give a generous burial, and the coffin was taken back by the family.</p>
<p>The Provincial Security Team Captures a Major Bandit: The major bandit Wang Fengyi and others had committed numerous crimes before Ma Yuren's time, but Wang lived peacefully in Hupu, in this county, and no one dared to arrest him. This year, after the Pacification and Security Army came to garrison in this county, the battalion headquarters dispatched the Sixth Infantry Company to garrison in Hupu, and everything was peaceful. On the evening of the 27th, Company Commander Chen received a secret letter reporting that bandits were hiding in the house of a Pan family in this port. Company Commander Chen then gathered the local security and sent some soldiers to the upstairs of the Pan family. As expected, they captured Chen Changwan. They took him back to the company headquarters for detailed interrogation. Chen confessed that there were still Lu Rujin and the boss Wang Fengyi staying in this town. That night, Company Commander Chen captured Wang and Lu one after another. On the morning of the 28th, he personally escorted them to the battalion headquarters in the city. Battalion Commander Shen Yiming personally investigated them. Bandit Wang confessed and cunningly denied any banditry. Lu Rujin claimed that he was not a bandit and was currently a detective in the 13th Water Police Team. Later, due to the nature of his duties, he was inevitably implicated by the bandits. Battalion Commander Shen then used the telephone to ask the 13th Team if there was such a detective. Team Leader Yang Qingjiu proved that he was indeed a detective in his team. Patrol Officer Wang Jiarong was then dispatched to the camp headquarters in the North Gate to request bail. Battalion Commander Shen handed Lu Rujin over to Patrol Officer Wang to take away. Wang and Chen were temporarily detained in the Public Security Bureau detention center.</p>

<h3>Oda's Triple Jump and Nanbu's Long Jump</h3>
<p>Both Set New Japanese Records</p>
<p>(Dentsu Tokyo, 29th) In preparation for the Far Eastern Games, track and field events were held yesterday at Koshien Stadium. Oda Mikio, Japan's leading figure in jumping events, achieved a distance of 15.48 meters in the triple jump, setting a new Japanese record. He also achieved a height of 15.56 meters in the standing high jump, which would have broken the world record, but unfortunately, the equipment was incomplete, resulting in a loss of 8 millimeters, which is a great pity. On the same day, at a meeting in Osaka of the Japan Intercollegiate Athletic Federation's OB alumni living in the Kansai region, Nanbu Chuhei, a graduate of Waseda University, achieved a distance of 7.67 meters in the long jump, also setting a new Japanese record.</p>
<h3>Shocking Shanghai's Soccer Scene: The Emergence of the Tunghwa Football Team</h3>
<p>Initiator Prefers Anonymity, Dai Linzao Confirmed as Manager</p>
<p>Strength Comparable to the Previous Lok Wah Team</p>
<p>Formal Establishment Planned for September/October</p>
<p>Since the separation of Lok Wah and Chinan, Shanghai's famous soccer players have dispersed and pursued their own paths, worrying many fans who have been waiting for Lok Wah to revive or for the emergence of a similarly strong organization. After much discussion and anticipation within Shanghai's soccer community, there is now some concrete news to share with fans.</p>
<h3>The Tunghwa Team Rises in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Before recounting the details, the reporter must emphasize that this is not a revival or reorganization of Lok Wah, but rather the emergence of another strong organization, named the Tunghwa Football Team. The team's formation is due to the efforts of a highly respected and enthusiastic individual, one of the many soccer fans. Seeing the importance of public sports and international reputation, and especially since soccer is valued by many countries, this person prepared a meeting and invited famous players to form a new organization. However, before its formal establishment, this person does not wish to reveal his name, stating that it would not add to the facts. However, his pure intentions are similar to those of Cheng Yize, who is currently well-known in the sports world. Dai Linzao has been appointed as the team's manager. Dai is the brother of the well-known center forward Dai Linjing and has good connections in the soccer community, so he will certainly be able to fulfill his duties successfully.</p>
<h3>Many Famous Players Return</h3>
<p>Responding to the call, many famous soccer players, who were previously wandering and without a place to use their skills, have joined the new organization thanks to the preparations and organization by this enthusiastic individual. The team's key members include Zhou Xianyan, Feng Yunyou, Li Ning, Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Pu, Sun Sijing, Dai Linjing, etc., who recently toured Southeast Asia with the Chinese team (there is also talk of Chen Zhenhe joining the team), as well as the newly returned Tu Kaiyuan and veteran players Chen Yutian and Xi Qiaosheng, etc. The team will be formally established when the touring players return to Shanghai. With such talent, the team is sure to be impressive. Readers, please wait and see.</p>
<h3>Record of the Kiangnan Track and Field Team's Northern Expedition (Part 1)</h3>
<p>| First Battle: Against the Central Government in Beijing |</p>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: After arriving in Beijing, the Kiangnan Track and Field Team, in order to make training more interesting, specially invited track and field athletes from National Central University to compete against them.</p>
<p>Kiangnan Not Disappointed: National Central University is China's highest institution of learning, and its Department of Physical Education occupies a particularly important position. Therefore, it has a unique perspective on promoting sports. Even though it was the summer vacation and the athletes had dispersed to their homes, the university resolutely agreed to compete against Kiangnan, with the intention of not disappointing Kiangnan. Indeed, in the results of the competition, Central University won several events.</p>
<p>Acclimatization Reduced Performance: Several strong athletes on the Kiangnan side were unable to participate due to acclimatization and physical discomfort. Others勉强 (miǎnqiǎng - reluctantly/barely) participated in training, but their results were below par, such as Zeng Rongzhong, Chen Xingpei, and Shu Zhaoxian. Furthermore, the long journey during the summer vacation also affected the performance of the other athletes.</p>
<p>Zeng Rongzhong Suffers from Diarrhea: Zeng Rongzhong, the team's 400-meter specialist, suffered from diarrhea after arriving in Nanjing, possibly due to acclimatization. After being treated by Dr. Zhao Shifa, a famous doctor in the capital, it was said to be enteritis, but not very severe and should recover after a few days of treatment.</p>
<p>National Record in Javelin: In all the events, only Wang Jihwai's javelin throw of 47.65 meters broke Wen Dingxin's national record (45.90 meters), which was no small feat.</p>
<p>Wang Fuchen Shows His Skill: At the same time, Wang Fuchen, a coach at the Central Military Academy, also participated in the demonstration, with a javelin throw of 49.10 meters, proving that he is an outstanding javelin thrower. Unfortunately, he has lost his amateur status; otherwise, he would have a great chance of winning the javelin championship at the Double Tenth National Games. The results of each event were already published in yesterday's newspaper and will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>Central University Hosts a Banquet: After the competition, Wu Demao, a lecturer at Central University, representing the Department of Physical Education, invited the entire Kiangnan team to a banquet at the Central Hotel. The teams treated each other courteously and respectfully, and exchanged team flags, ending the evening in good spirits.</p>
<h3>Lin Wangsu Wins Second Place in the Singapore Chinese-Japanese Tennis Doubles</h3>

<h3>Wang Chia-chen Discusses Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Long Familiar With Materials on Recovering Concessions</p>
<p>Negotiations With Russia Still Addressing Management of the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Chia-chen came to Shanghai on official business the other day. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency interviewed him at his private residence in the French Concession, asking about the recent diplomatic situation as follows:</p>
<p>Recovering Concessions: According to Wang's answer to the reporter's question, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has long been familiar with the materials on recovering concessions in various places and does not need to collect or investigate them. Although the Ministry has appointed Vice Minister Li Chin-lun, Director of the European and American Department Xu Mo, and others as members of the committee, it is only for studying the nature of the concessions. Reports that they have gone to various places for investigation are not true. In the future, negotiations will begin with the Gulangyu, Wuhu, and Yantai (reports say Suzhou, but it should be Yantai) public concessions. The nature of the Wuhu and Yantai concessions is different from that of the Shanghai and Gulangyu public concessions. Shanghai is the largest public concession, while these two public concessions only have management committees and police, without an administrative organization. These two cannot be considered public concessions.</p>
<p>Sino-French Exploration: Regarding the incident of French members of the Sino-French Scientific Exploration Team assaulting Chinese members, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a telegram requesting a formal report before determining the next steps. Rumors that the government has sent a telegram ordering them to stop are unknown to me.</p>
<p>Sino-Russian Negotiations: The Russian side strongly agrees in principle to the redemption of the Chinese Eastern Railway, but this matter cannot be resolved quickly. Currently, the discussions are about the management of the railway, and there is not much progress.</p>
<p>Mi Shuangzhen Case: The case of the Japanese in Liaoyang pouring kerosene and cold water on the Hui Muslim Mi Shuangzhen, resulting in his death, is still being handled at the local level and has not been transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry has only seen reports about this case and does not have clear details. Recently, the Ministry has sent a telegram to Shenyang to inquire about everything.</p>

<p>Types of Instruments: There are many types of weights and measures. The following is a breakdown: (1) Types of length measures: ruler, carpenter's square, tape measure, chain measure, etc. (2) Types of volume measures: hu, dou, sheng, he, etc. (3) Types of weight measures: hook scales, small scales, platform scales, balance scales, named scales, etc. There are also scientific instruments, gas meters, water meters, electricity meters, surveying instruments, etc., which are all special types of weights and measures.</p>
<p>Director Zhou Speaks: Zhou Zanming, director of the Weights and Measures Inspection Office, told a reporter from the New Sound News Agency yesterday that the weights and measures used in our country have always been freely manufactured by the people, without any standards, leading to the chaotic situation of today. Leaving aside the past, there are probably no fewer than hundreds of types still circulating among the people. The difference in the capacity of each instrument not only varies with the locality and business, but also varies greatly even within the same locality or the same business, and even within the same business in the same locality. In addition, there are also differences in the length, size, weight, etc. of instruments of the same type. The instruments that will be destroyed in this inspection are only those weights and measures that are beyond repair, such as the small instruments used by vegetable vendors. According to Article 47 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Weights and Measures Act, those that are deemed irreparable during inspection should be destroyed. As for weights and measures that are found to be inconsistent during the upcoming grand inspection, they will be stamped as unqualified or instructed to be modified. However, those that are beyond repair must still be destroyed.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on Japanese Fishing Vessels</h3>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Encroachment on Territorial Waters</p>
<p>To Be Implemented Starting Tomorrow</p>
<p>Japanese fishing vessels entering our country's territorial waters to fish freely, and even driving away our fishing vessels, treating us as guests in our own home, has been repeatedly protested by various central government departments to the Japanese side. Subsequently, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Industry, and the Navy held a meeting and clearly defined the boundaries of territorial waters, stipulating that Japanese fishing vessels may not enter within twelve nautical miles of our country's sea surface. It has now been decided that this restriction on territorial waters will be implemented starting July 1st. The various ministries have ordered the customs offices and instructed the Naval Headquarters to pass the order to patrol boats and warships. Starting July 1st, if Japanese fishing vessels again encroach within the defined twelve nautical miles to fish, it will be considered a violation of our territorial waters and fishing rights. The warships are authorized to expel them. If they refuse to comply, they may be detained and handed over to the Japanese authorities for punishment.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Conflict Between Wusong Anti-Smuggling Camp and Public Security Bureau Police</h3>
<p>Serious Situation… Shops Panicked</p>
<p>Army Suppression… Finally Calmed</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at approximately 3:00 PM, a conflict occurred between soldiers from the First Brigade of the Anti-Smuggling Corps, which belongs to Jiangsu Province and is stationed on the Wusong Outer Bund, and police officers from the First Precinct of the Seventh District Public Security Bureau due to a minor misunderstanding. The situation became serious, and nearby shops panicked and closed their doors. Upon receiving the news, Battalion Commander Xiong of the Second Battalion of the 27th Regiment, Fifth Division stationed in Wusong, quickly dispatched troops to suppress the conflict, and it was eventually calmed. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Urination Incident: The day before yesterday (the 28th), at approximately 5:30 AM, Huang Guiqing, a soldier from the First Patrol Boat, First Brigade of the Anti-Smuggling Corps, dressed in plain clothes, was urinating on a vacant lot at the intersection of Doushi Road and Yu Tong Road in Wusong. Officer Gao Yunian of the First Precinct of the Seventh District noticed this and immediately intervened. Soldier Huang then fled back to the patrol boat moored on the Pujiang River off the Outer Bund. Officer Gao pursued him onto the boat to arrest him, and a conflict ensued. It escalated into violence, and Gao was injured. He returned to the precinct to report the incident. Afterward, the Anti-Smuggling Corps apologized to the First Precinct, and the matter was settled.</p>
<p>Police Officer Assaulted: Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 29th) at 11:00 AM, Zhang Falin, a soldier from the Fourth Patrol Boat of the Anti-Smuggling Corps, was walking from south to north when he passed the Yunzaobang Bridge. For unknown reasons, he suddenly clashed with a police officer from the First Precinct, resulting in Zhang sustaining serious injuries. He returned to report this to the other soldiers, who were enraged upon hearing the news. At approximately 3:00 PM, Yu, the helmsman of the First Patrol Boat, gathered more than ten people and marched to the intersection of Yu Tong Road, dragging two patrol officers, Liu Hongji and Ma Zhilin, from their posts at Songyu Road to the corps headquarters, eventually causing them injuries.</p>
<p>Shops Panicked: When Liu and others were injured, they immediately blew their whistles frantically. Armed police officers from the precinct's patrol team, upon hearing the alarm, rushed to the Anti-Smuggling Corps headquarters as if facing a major enemy. At that time, a gunshot was heard, and nearby shops immediately panicked and closed their doors. The situation was extremely serious. Battalion Commander Xiong Kexi of the Second Battalion of the 27th Regiment, Fifth Division of the Army stationed in Wusong, upon receiving the news, considering it concerned local security, immediately led more than twenty soldiers armed with live ammunition to suppress the situation. The incident was eventually calmed.</p>
<p>Mediation Unsuccessful: An investigation revealed that Zhang Maocai, a bugler in the Anti-Smuggling Corps, was injured, and a bullet hole was found in the ceiling downstairs in the corps headquarters, but the floorboard was not penetrated. The injured soldiers and police officers were all sent to Wusong Haibin Public Hospital for treatment. That evening at 8:00 PM, Battalion Commander Xiong convened a meeting with Zhao Zezhou, the District Chief of the Seventh District Public Security Bureau, Zhang Jiguang, the Chief of the First Precinct of the Seventh District, and Li Huchen, the Captain of the Anti-Smuggling Corps, to discuss mediation. The superiors of both sides have reported the matter to their superiors and requested instructions.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Measures for Collecting Municipal General Tax</h3>
<p>Changing to Public Notice Method</p>
<p>Equal Treatment for Chinese and Foreigners</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's method for collecting municipal general taxes on foreign-style houses within the Settlement has been to issue notices 14 days in advance, then send tax collectors to collect the taxes. A month ago, the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association repeatedly urged the Municipal Council to provide equal treatment for Chinese and foreigners, and to issue notices 14 days in advance for Chinese-style houses as well so that taxpayers could prepare accordingly. It is now reported that the Municipal Council, to show equal treatment for Chinese and foreigners, has cancelled the practice of issuing advance notices for foreign-style houses and has adopted a public notice method, publishing notices in both Chinese and foreign newspapers. The following is the Public Notice No. 4109 regarding the collection of the autumn general tax: Public Notice: It is hereby notified that the tax on all types of Chinese and foreign houses for the quarter ending September 30th of this year is due on July 1st and collection will begin on that date. All tax payments should be made to the Council's tax collectors or directly to the Tax Office at 209 Jiangxi Road. This notice is hereby announced. Acting Secretary-General, Mackie.</p>
<h3>Landlords Should Obtain Guarantees from Tenants</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a circular to its member real estate companies yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that we have received a letter from the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association stating that Article 5 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Kidnappers stipulates that landlords should obtain guarantees from tenants. To prevent kidnapping, in addition to writing to the Municipal Council for assistance in implementing this regulation, we are writing to your association to inform all members to comply accordingly." It is understood that landlords obtaining guarantees from tenants has already been implemented under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Government, but it is still rare in the Special District. Previously, it was possible to choose freely, and as long as the rent was paid, there were no major difficulties. Now, legislators, in order to prevent kidnapping and eliminate it completely, have specially formulated the Regulations for the Punishment of Kidnappers, and Article 5 specifically stipulates that landlords must obtain guarantees from tenants. This regulation was promulgated and implemented by the National Government long ago. Fortunately, in the case of the Youtong Company's houses on Wuding Road, the landlord had obtained guarantees from the tenants, otherwise it would not have been easy to overturn the confiscation. In accordance with the aforementioned letter, we are writing to inform you, hoping that you will investigate and handle this matter promptly, in order to comply with the law and prevent kidnapping. If tenants object and it is difficult to implement, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association has already written to the authorities in the Special District requesting assistance. You can report the matter directly to the police station.</p>

<h3>Ziqiang Warship Conducted Trial Run and Gunnery Test Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Awaiting Reorganization</p>
<p>After a trial run in the Longhua area, the Ziqiang warship, under the command of Captain Qiu Shizhong, naval ordnance supervisor Zheng Zichi, shipyard director Yu Jianfu, and various supervisors, set sail from 6:00 AM yesterday morning and headed to the outer Wusong estuary for gunnery and navigation tests. A total of twelve 5.1-inch cannons at the bow and stern of the ship fired twice each, with a range of 10,000 yards. The recoil was about 9 inches. The sound was thunderous. Two shells hit the target below, two shells were slightly ahead, and one was slightly behind, with a difference of about 20 yards. After the test, the 3-inch cannons and the German 20mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns were also tested. The results were very satisfactory. The Oerlikon anti-aircraft gun shells were fired in a chain, and their agility and stability were particularly outstanding. The tests ended at 11:00 AM, and then the maximum speed test began, reaching 19 knots per hour, which is one knot faster than the Datong warship. The turning, reversing, and manpower navigation were also more agile and better than the Datong. The tests were completed at 5:00 PM, and the ship returned to Gaochangmiao at 7:00 PM to await reorganization.</p>
<h3>Employees of the National Products Department Store to Petition Today Regarding the Case</h3>
<p>Regarding the Municipal Council's Order to Close the National Products Department Store Case: After repeated discussions by the Negotiating Committee of the Chinese Directors of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, a resolution has been reached. For the sake of their livelihoods, all employees will go to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and the Citizens' General Association today to petition. The various situations yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Emergency General Meeting: All employees of the National Products Department Store convened an emergency general meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. Li Weicheng was elected temporary chairman. Chen Weixin and Liu Musu reported on the negotiation process. The following resolutions were passed: (1) It was decided that tomorrow (the 30th) at 10:00 AM, all 600 employees would carry the negotiation terms and depart to petition the Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and the Citizens' United Association. (2) It was decided that this afternoon, six representatives would be selected to ask Mr. Li Zhengwu for help to maintain the employees' situation. It was also heard that the association would certify that the negotiation regarding the Department Store's illegal closure and the assault on staff by the Municipal Council has not been resolved after more than 20 days, and the union will automatically respond.</p>
<p>Petition: The petition from all employees of the National Products Department Store to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association is as follows: We, the assembled employees, respectfully petition, requesting that you promptly engage in serious negotiations with the Municipal Council to resolve this outstanding case, uphold national rights, protect national products, and maintain the employees' livelihoods. We respectfully request your attention to this matter. The cause of the Department Store's illegal closure by the Municipal Council has been reported by the Negotiating Committee of the Department Store to the Central Government and your office, requesting serious negotiations and proposing seven conditions for resolving the case. The employees have been quietly waiting for a resolution and dare not rashly interfere. However, we believe that the closure of the Department Store has lasted for more than 20 days, which is not a short time, and the date of resolution is still far away and hopeless. The employees have suffered since the incident. Not only can the sweat and labor wages not be paid by the Department Store, but even daily meals can no longer be provided by the Department Store. If this case is further delayed, the lives of hundreds of employees and the livelihoods of thousands of family members can only perish together. This is a real cause for midnight anxiety, and we cannot help but speak out. The Municipal Council previously asked the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to mediate. In its verbal and written reports at the meeting, it admitted the mistake of closing the Department Store, which undoubtedly bears legal responsibility. Furthermore, according to the seven conditions proposed by the Department Store to the Municipal Council, the claims are based on reason and do not make excessive demands. If the Municipal Council is truly determined to repent, it should accept the conditions as soon as possible and restore the Department Store's business. However, after admitting the mistake, it has made no other representation. How can such a major case be dealt with by simply glossing over it with the word "mistake"? Its intention is to maintain its imperialistic stance, adhere to its power, and oppress the weak. There is no so-called justice, let alone law. The admission of error in the report to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was merely to ease the anti-imperialist movement of our people and cool down our anti-imperialist enthusiasm, so that after a long delay, the Department Store would disappear without a trace, and the case could be left unresolved like various past cases. Its plan can be said to be very clever, and its intention can be said to be very vicious. In order to protect the Department Store's life and the livelihoods of thousands of employees, in addition to establishing the National Products Department Store Employees' United Association as the Department Store's support, we specially present our grievances. All employees respectfully petition, requesting that your office grant us an audience, listen to our opinions, promptly engage in serious negotiations with the Municipal Council, and resolve the matter as soon as possible, so that national rights can be upheld, national products can be developed, and the Department Store's life and the employees' lives can be extended.</p>

<h3>Pan Gongzhan and Tang Demin Request the Establishment of a National Art Museum</h3>
<p>One of the Proposals to the First Congress</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan and Tang Demin believe that the impact of art's social education on national fortune is great, so they specifically proposed to the Municipal Congress that the Central Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Education jointly establish a National Art Museum to promote the realization of the Three Principles of the People. The original text is as follows: (A) Reasons: The prosperity and decline of a country and nation are greatly related to school education, but even more so to social education. The accuracy of the national spirit's transmission, the improvement of social order, and the enhancement of national wisdom can all be measured by the degree of development of social education. Half of the function of social education is related to art. Although art is not as necessary as food, clothing, housing, and transportation in life, it is of great value in increasing the meaning of human life. Film, drama, music, and painting are all closely related to life, directly shaping emotions and harmonizing life. Indirectly, they can cause various good and evil responses in the human heart, and cultivate creative desires. The so-called joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are not just emotional impulses in a short time, but contain the active meaning of controlling life. This is undeniable. In terms of quantity (the mimeograph is blurred here), the efficiency of art's control cannot be ignored. Taking only the film industry in Shanghai as an example, at least 100,000 people receive the direct intuition of film (calculated with 40 cinemas, each with 2,500 people). Drama is half of that. Taking this as an example for China, more than ten million people are dominated by film and drama every day. The eye-catching nature of painting is even more widespread, and the lyrics and scores of music can spread even further. This is the two-dimensional effectiveness of art, which no one can deny. However, if we silently observe the currently popular films, dramas, music, and paintings, what is the impact on the nation? Most of the films are imported. The domestic films are biased towards gods and monsters. There are few that are beneficial to the welfare of our nation and society, like stars in the morning. Most of the dramas, especially Peking Opera, are based on unofficial history, which is not superstitious but biased towards feudal thoughts. It has long lost its value in the current era. New dramas are still in their infancy, and it is rare to find those that are suitable for our ideals and benefit the prosperity of the country and nation. The same applies to music and painting. Our country is in a period of transition. In order to make the people understand the Three Principles of the People, accept Sun Yat-sen's teachings, and subtly increase the people's sense of meaning and responsibility towards the country and nation, as well as arouse the people's interest in construction, in addition to seeking help from schools, it is necessary to double the results with less effort.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>To be effective, suitable for all ages, both men and women, there is no way other than to focus on the social education of art. Art is the most effective weapon for propaganda and has long been recognized by the general public. However, to achieve this great wish by seeking help from commercial art institutions or groups is like climbing a tree to catch fish. Although the government's Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Education have organized a censorship committee to ban all films that are harmful to the welfare of our nation, the meaning of this only extends to passive prevention and reducing the evils of films, dramas, music, and paintings on the nation. To actively seek results from the social education of art, only the state can promote it. Methods: (1) The congress should petition the central government to instruct the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Education to jointly establish a National Art Museum. The National Art Museum should have four departments: film, drama, music, and painting. Each department should establish a committee and appoint specialized personnel to serve as members. The collection and editing of all film, drama, music, and painting materials should be centered on enlightening the Three Principles of the People, especially paying attention to inspiring national significance, arousing the people's sense of national responsibility, and interests in construction, and promoting the inherent morality of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace. In addition to promoting the produced films in cinemas at home and abroad, the Film Department should establish national cinemas in the capital and Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Hankou, Tianjin, and the provincial capitals of various provinces. The Drama Department should divide into old and new dramas. Although old dramas have lost their value in the current era, they still have a deep influence in society and cannot be banned. The only way is to improve their scripts and lyrics. In addition to printing and distributing the improved scripts and lyrics to various old-style theaters and directors, national theaters should also be established in the capital, Shanghai, Hankou, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and the provincial capitals of various provinces. In addition to printing and selling the scripts of new dramas for local drama clubs and students to purchase, national new drama theaters should also be established in the capital, Shanghai, Hankou, Beijing, Tianjin, and the provincial capitals of various provinces. In addition to compiling Chinese and Western music scores for schools and various musical groups to purchase, the Music Department should also establish music academies in various prosperous cities. In addition to promoting works with the Three Principles of the People as the central theme, the Painting Department should hold painting exhibitions every year in the capital and various prosperous cities, and reward those with excellent achievements. Then the atmosphere will change and the results will be predictable. As for the expenses of the National Art Museum, the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Education should prepare a budget and submit it to the National Government for allocation.</p>
<h3>Various Labor Unions to Propose Motions at the Municipal Assembly</h3>
<p>The Municipal Assembly of this city is scheduled to open on July 1st. Dozens of labor unions, including the Municipal Postal and Publishing Unions, considering the urgent need to expedite the implementation of various resolutions regarding labor movements passed by the National Assembly, have specially prepared a motion to be submitted for discussion at the opening of the assembly. Simultaneously, they will dispatch representatives to request permission to attend the assembly as observers to present their case in person. It is reported that the official submission and motion have already been drafted. The following is a transcription:</p>
<p>Submitting this document to request the dispatch of representatives and respectfully present the motion, requesting the Assembly to grant permission for attendance as observers and to present the motion for discussion, so that it may be publicly resolved and implemented.</p>
<p>We respectfully note that the National Assembly has resolved three items regarding the reform of labor movement organization laws, which have been submitted to the National Government for consideration and handling. First, the revision of the Labor Union Law and the Factory Law to protect the interests of workers. Second, the establishment of national, provincial, municipal, and county-level federations of labor unions. Third, the promulgation of special labor union laws. The Assembly resolved two items regarding the guarantee and relief of workers' livelihoods, which have been submitted to the National Government for consideration and handling. These are the diligent implementation of labor education and the relief of unemployed workers. All the plans formulated and resolved by the National Assembly in accordance with the Party's political program and in compliance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings are the unanimous demands of workers nationwide and the guiding principles for the Party and the government to actively rectify the labor movement during the period of political tutelage. Our unions believe that the supervision and implementation of the above resolutions are urgently needed. Therefore, we respectfully prepare this document with attached reasons and dispatch representatives Zhu Xingfan, Zhou Xuexiang, Li Yongxiang, Zhao Zhenhui, Zhao Shusheng, Wang Wenhua, Tang Junsheng, [name missing], Chen Peide, Sheng Muqin, and Gu Ruofeng, eleven persons in total, to present our case in person to the Assembly, requesting permission to attend as observers and to present the motion for discussion, to benefit the labor movement and serve the Party. We respectfully submit this.</p>
<p>Attached is the motion on the left (Original text of the motion):</p>
<p>We earnestly request that this be forwarded to the Central Government, consulting with the National Government to quickly guide the resolutions on the labor movement from the National Assembly, thoroughly revise the Labor Union Law and the Factory Law, and add articles to the Labor Union Law to organize national, provincial, municipal, and county-level federations of labor unions, promulgate special labor union laws, and diligently implement labor education and relief for unemployed workers. Is this appropriate? We respectfully await a public resolution.</p>
<p>(Reasons)</p>
<p>This city is the center of the national labor movement. The labor movement in this city is where our Party's revolutionary strength lies. Therefore, rectifying the labor movement in this city directly serves the interests of workers and indirectly contributes to the development of a new life for our Party. This session of the Assembly coincides with the opening more than a month after the closing of the National Assembly. It bears a significant mission and arduous responsibility for supervising and promoting the implementation of the resolutions of the National Assembly. Whether the several major resolutions concerning the labor movement are implemented or not has a particularly significant impact on the labor movement in this city. Therefore, this motion is put forward with great seriousness.</p>
<p>(Measures)</p>
<p>We respectfully request that the Assembly resolve to promptly forward this to the Central Government, consulting with the National Government to implement this as soon as possible. Submitted by: Shanghai Publishing Industry Labor Union, Postal Labor Union, Textile Industry Labor Union of the Seventh District, Water and Electricity Industry Labor Union of the Sixth District, Water and Electricity Industry Labor Union of the First District, etc.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Ministry of Finance Telegraph to Urge Fundamental Solution for Silk Industry Public Bonds Distribution Method</h3>
<p>Experts have already drafted concrete methods</p>
<p>Executive Committee discussed yesterday and deemed further study necessary</p>
<p>The Fourth Executive Committee of the Jiang-Zhe Silk Industry Public Bonds held a discussion yesterday at the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry. The attendees were committee members Mu Ouchu, Chu Huiseng, Shen [name missing]chen, Deng Bingwen, Qian Fenghao, Lu Shutang, silk industry experts Zheng Bijang, Zhou Tingding, Ge Jingzhong, and Cheng Zhenjun, Director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Industry, ten people in total, with Mu Ouchu as chairman. The discussion details, fundamental solution proposals, and the telegraphs from the two ministries are recorded below.</p>
<p>Discussion Details:</p>
<p>The discussion yesterday focused on the fundamental problems of the silk industry. First, experts presented draft plans for improving machinery and improving sericulture. Then the discussion began. However, when discussing the issue of receiving subsidies for purchasing and adding cocoon boiling machines in the machinery improvement section, the discussion reached a standstill due to the stipulation that the machinery could not be resold after being equipped with cocoon boiling machines. The question was, to whom would the ownership of the machinery belong in the future: the silk manufacturers, the landlords, or would another method be devised? After a lengthy discussion, it was generally agreed that this issue was very important. It was resolved to wait for each association to conduct a detailed study and then discuss it again on Saturday (July 4th). As for the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry's urgent telegraph to submit the entire distribution plan to the ministry for review by July 2nd, it was resolved to request an extension due to insufficient time.</p>
<p>Telegraphs from the Two Ministries:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Ministry of Finance telegraphed to urge the distribution plan, stating: (Official salutations omitted) We received your telegram. Upon reviewing Article 3 of the amended Jiang-Zhe Silk Industry Public Bonds Regulations, it stipulates that the use of the silk industry public bonds is divided into fundamental and superficial items. Now is the period for proceeding with the distribution. It is appropriate to advance both the fundamental and superficial points at the same time. According to your telegram, the Third Meeting of the Association resolved to distribute the four million yuan for superficial items first. As for the fundamental one, a concrete method has not yet been discussed. The Association should quickly draft a detailed plan for the fundamental method and submit it to the ministry for review as necessary. As for the superficial method, although the Association resolved to consider two silk reeling machines and one bale of silk as a unit, the current detailed situation of each factory in Jiang-Zhe should be thoroughly investigated as the standard for the distribution of public bonds. The person in charge should be responsible for creating a detailed table, including (1) the factory name, (2) the address, (3) the number of machines, (4) whether self-owned or leased, (5) the number of silk bales, (6) the amount of bond notes that should be received, and (7) the seal of the person in charge, and submit it to the ministry for review within ten days of receiving this document. Await further instructions. Seal of the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry.</p>
<h3>The First District Branch of the Citizens' Association Strives for Rental Housing Rights</h3>
<p>The First District Branch of the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Citizens' Federation yesterday, proposing the motion that citizens should have the right to rental housing.</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, the original text reads, "In order to propose that citizens should have the right to rental housing, we request that your association expand the movement to achieve its goals, so as to secure a peaceful residence and benefit commercial transportation."</p>
<p>We note that renting houses for residence, whether in commercial ports or inland, has always been customary and without much conflict. However, in Shanghai's concessions in recent years, with the increase in commerce and population, the prices of real estate and rents have not only increased due to natural trends, but also because the Municipal Council has forcibly estimated high price standards in order to increase its donation revenue, which has promoted their rapid increase. As a result, those who operate real estate have greatly benefited, not only increasing their rental value at any time, but also setting out huge amounts of tips, digging fees, opening fees and other names to satisfy their greed, and the shop residents who pay the stars have greatly suffered their fruits. The capital fee for merchants to set up shops is already half of the rental price, not to mention the cost of decoration and property. And those who have slow business, one month's profit, or not enough to pay one month's rent. However, this situation is unique to a few and can be ignored. The most recently discovered situation is that tenants are unable to enjoy the happiness of living and working in peace and are living in anxiety, which is the evil practice of landlords arbitrarily increasing rents and forcing evictions.</p>
<p>For example, (A) the originally set rent is already expensive, and the tenant does not owe any rent, but the landlord takes the initiative to increase the price, and the percentage increase is extremely large, so that the tenant cannot afford it. They can also negotiate a reduction, but the evil ones have no accommodation at all, otherwise they order a forced eviction. (B) The age of the house may not have reached the time of demolition in fact, the landlord wants to renovate to increase the rent, that is, arbitrarily force the eviction. After the new house is completed, the monthly rent will be doubled compared to before, and the cost of renovation will be borrowed from the tip. Every time the original tenant is unable to continue renting the house, if a third person digs for rent, the landlord will covet the heavy profit and cleverly set up various plans to make them move out, regardless of the law and human feelings, so that the original tenant is forced to stop business, not only the shop owner is damaged, but also the employees who depend on the owner for their livelihood are unemployed. (D) Large capitalists who trust the doctrine of the company, determine the large area of land, rent land from the owner to build houses, or for real estate profits, become the owner of the company. The owner also covets its profits and disregards everything, willing to sacrifice hundreds of tenants for one tenant. (E) Tenants and landlords have disputes, often the landlord based on the magic of money, the hand of lightning speed, or use of separation tricks, or use of oppressive behavior, cutting off water and electricity, hitting the wall to dismantle the house, nothing can not be done.</p>
<p>The above five points are only the main points. Although it is not a fact that happens from time to time, the fact of the matter has happened a lot, and it is also verified.</p>
<p>In short, its harm also has five points, one is to destroy the rental habit, the second is to infringe on the legal rights of renting, the third is to hinder public order, the fourth is to disturb social stability, and the fifth is to lose morality. If this goes on, the merchants and residents who rent houses among the citizens will be like hawkers who bear the burden, not as good as hawkers. Those who set up stalls and bear the burden, originally those who seek to provide, may as well seek profit from the east and west. Stores must have a fixed address, often moving, new drafts are difficult to find, that is, to get land, business is damaged, decoration and property advertising rent, etc., must be to the customers who need electricity, do not lose more than half. As for the household, there are also various disadvantages, the area of the association, located in the center of the concession, see and hear the most, and the citizens in this area are also deeply harmed. If we do not find a way to rescue them as soon as possible, it will inevitably affect the imperial industry and the whole city, and even affect the inland, its harm is not known. If we talk about rescue measures, the most positive way is to petition the National Government and the municipal government to issue special laws and regulations on the protection of residence rights, and the citizens' organization has a systematic and united specialized committee to agree on limiting the profit-making degree of landlords, or dividing the concessions into sections, depending on the prosperity of the location, the newness of the old houses, to set the rental price standard, regulate a rental rules, to the authorities for the record, requiring the landlord to recognize and accept. The passive way is to have a group of tenants in the city deal with it appropriately according to the severity of the case. However, this matter is a big deal, and it is not possible to gather the sympathy of the tenants and citizens of the city and give it a big movement. Therefore, after the executive committee, according to the public opinion of the majority of members of the association's inaugural meeting, the meeting resolved to ask your association to discuss, gather together, and seek permanent peace and happiness.</p>
<h3>Zhengji Company Will Move to Qingdao</h3>
<p>Seeking to Break Free from Japanese Shackles</p>
<p>Requesting Central Government Subsidy</p>
<p>Dismissing Japanese Employees:</p>
<p>Among Chinese commercial shipping companies, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the giant in the South, while Zhengji Company is the largest in North China. Due to devastation by warlords, it moved its headquarters to Dalian Bay. Over the years, it has suffered oppression from the Japanese and has felt considerable pain. The various taxes paid to the Japanese each year are also quite substantial. Among the more than twenty commercial vessels, many of the senior crew members were also Japanese. In recent years, in order to recover outward flowing interests, it first dismissed more than twenty Japanese crew members from each vessel and replaced them with domestic shipping professionals. The company intends to replace all of its Japanese employees with Chinese citizens in succession.</p>
<p>Moving the Headquarters:</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Benzheng, the person in charge of the company, feels that the shipping industry has been depressed in recent years and has also been subjected to various restrictions by the Japanese. He is determined to break free from the Japanese shackles. When the company expanded in the year of Yichou, the Northeast Party authorities joined as government shareholders. Now, Mr. Zhang has informed the Liaoning authorities that he has decided to close the Dalian Bay headquarters and move the headquarters to Qingdao, which is under Chinese jurisdiction. This has been agreed upon and is already in the planning stage. Once the Qingdao headquarters location is prepared, the relocation will take place immediately.</p>
<p>Requesting a Subsidy:</p>
<p>Currently, the shipping industry is in a downturn. Mr. Zhang Benzheng, the person in charge of the company, has petitioned the Central Government for an appropriate subsidy to enable the development of Chinese commercial vessels in North China. It is said that Mr. Zhang intends to go to the capital in person to present the current state of business to the Ministry of Transportation in order to achieve the goal of government subsidy.</p>

<h3>Department Store Industry Firmly Requests Reduction of Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Department Store Industry Association believes that the business tax rate of three per mille is truly unbearable and violates the previously promulgated ministerial guidelines and the resolutions of the National Conference on the Abolition of Likin, disregarding the months of correspondence and urgent appeals from merchants and citizens. They are shocked and beyond words. Therefore, they convened an emergency meeting yesterday and resolved that the items sold by department stores are all daily necessities for ordinary people or belong to the scope that should be promoted. Business has been difficult in recent years, and they have long been in a state of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak. If they are taxed at a high rate that violates the guidelines, they will have no choice but to comply with the notice issued by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Tax Research Committee on February 28th: 1. If the business tax in any province or city exceeds the regulations of the Executive Yuan, there is no basis for collection by the provincial and municipal governments. 2. Merchants and citizens in various industries should not disobey the order to pay the original tax and should wait for a solution. Representatives will be elected to present the unavoidable difficulties to the Tax Research Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and actively request a reduction, to a maximum of no more than two per mille.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medicine Association Willing to Fulfill Obligations to the Poor and Sick</h3>
<p>Reply to Municipal Health Bureau Letter</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government approved the Shanghai Party Department's request to instruct the Health Bureau to notify Chinese and Western doctors in the city to fulfill their obligations to the poor and sick, so as to value the lives of citizens. The Chinese Medicine Association replied to the Bureau yesterday, saying: "In reply, we have received your letter, which states that the Shanghai Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has written to the effect that the Sixth District Party Department of the Association has submitted a document stating that registered doctors in the city should fulfill their obligations to the poor and that the Municipal Health Bureau should be consulted and ordered to comply. Accordingly, it has been found that the city has a large population, and the majority are coolies and the poor. They usually struggle to make ends meet. Once they are sick, they moan and fall, and there is no one to turn to. It is often heard and seen that one person is sick and the whole family is waiting to die. This is especially true in summer and autumn. Therefore, it is appropriate to widely establish clinics to benefit the poor and sick. Moreover, helping the sick and rescuing disasters and treating diseases are all stipulated in the Party's political program. Shanghai should take the lead in implementing this. The Standing Committee of the Association has resolved to amend this and forward it to the Municipal Government for the record. Accordingly, we enclose a copy of the letter for your reference. We hope you will verify this and give us a reply. The doctors originally had a compassionate heart and should give appropriate treatment to the poor. In addition to issuing a separate order, this letter is to be forwarded to you. We hope you will forward this to the doctors so that they can practice it in moderation, so as to benefit the poor and comply with good intentions. In view of the foregoing, we have found that Chinese medicine has always been compassionate in treating diseases. There is a precedent for not counting the poor. In order to take care of the health of the people, our association has established a Chinese Hospital to meet the needs of society. The Bureau of Society has already filed a record. Other Chinese medicine clinics, such as Renji Hall, Guangyi Chinese Hospital, Qianyi Traumatology Hospital, Hubian Guangyi Chinese Hospital, Guangyi Shantang, Hunan Shenzhou Hospital, Fuli Hospital, Boji Benevolent Society, Guangren Shantang, Zhisheng Benevolent Institute, Weizhong Benevolent Hall, Yishan Society, Lianyi Benevolent Association, Yuanji Benevolent Hall, Cantonese Merchants Hospital, Chinese Hospital, Hualong Chinese Hospital, Chaozhou Heji Hospital, Siming Hospital, etc., either provide treatment and medicine or provide wards for treatment. As for the society, it feels that it has done a little bit of its duty. Because of the letter, in addition to notifying the members, we now enclose a list of the locations, times, and methods of Chinese medicine clinics in this city for your reference. We hope that you will publish this in the newspaper to benefit the people, which is no small matter. We reply to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau.</p>

<h3>Local News: Two Foreign Communists</h3>
<p>A suspicious man and woman</p>
<p>Belgian passports found to be forged</p>
<p>Approximately 600 pieces of communist evidence</p>
<p>A Western man named Nielands, and a Western woman named Maude (also known as Wanda Keisen), both around 37 years old, claimed to be husband and wife, but lived separately. Nielands resided in Room 4, Building 235, Sichuan Road, while Maude resided in Room 30, Building 49, Sichuan Road. Their actions were highly suspicious. The police authorities paid close attention and assigned Western Detective McGregor to secretly investigate for a long time. Recently, it was discovered that the two were indeed well-known communists. They were arrested one after the other on the morning of the 15th of this month, and many communist documents were found in their residences. According to Nielands' confession, he was of Belgian nationality and his wife was French. The police contacted the Belgian and French consulates for investigation. As the two had not registered with the consulates when they came to Shanghai, there was no way to verify their identities. Therefore, both the Belgian and French consulates denied that Nielands and his wife were their citizens. Nielands then led the detectives to 74 Xihua Garden Road, claiming it was their joint residence. After searching the premises, the detectives found two passports, stating that both were of Belgian nationality. The police sent them to the Belgian consulate again. The Belgian consul, with passport proof, could not refuse and issued a search warrant, which was handed over to the police to send detectives to 74 Xihua Garden Road again for a thorough search. Various kinds of communist evidence were found, totaling about 600 pieces, including those obtained previously. Subsequently, the Belgian consul considered the case to be of great importance and telegraphed the Belgian government for verification. The reply received the day before yesterday stated that the two were definitely not of Belgian nationality and their passports were forged. The Belgian consul ordered them to be sent back to the police station for detention. Last night, they were sent to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Judge Du Fuyao held a court session and briefly questioned them. As evidence needed to be investigated, he ordered them to be detained separately pending further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wu Chunzhi, Owner of Huayang Restaurant on Fuyou Road, Stabbed to Death</h3>
<p>Negotiations to terminate the contract had just concluded</p>
<p>When a short man named Xiao Wang suddenly committed the crime</p>
<p>Around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Wu Chunzhi, the owner of Huayang Restaurant, a dim sum shop located east of Small World on Fuyou Road in the Nanshi area, opposite the 9th Team of the Shanghai South Security Corps, was suddenly stabbed to death by a well-known friend. The details are very complicated. The following is a detailed account of the incident:</p>
<p>The background of Chen Xiaomei: Chen Xiaomei, a woman from Pudong, is 19 years old. Although her appearance is only average, she is exceptionally lively and articulate. Her parents love her very much. Her father, named Xue Rong, used to run wood carving and foreign goods businesses. During its peak, he had as many as four stores in Shanghai. However, Chen's fortune was unlucky and the stores closed one after another, leading to a complete downfall. His wife, Zhou, and the whole family now live in Lan Ni Du, Pudong, seeking labor work to make a living. Xiaomei now works as a cigarette packer at the Fuxin Tobacco Company on Kangti Road in the French Concession. Every morning, she crosses the river to work at the factory, returning home as late as 2:00 AM the next morning.</p>
<p>One woman engaged twice: Several years ago, Xiaomei and her family once lived near Small World in Nanshi for about eight or nine years. At that time, Xiaomei was still young and learned handicrafts with her mother in a nearby foreign jade shop. Two years ago, her mother arranged for Xiaomei to be betrothed to a fellow villager and worker in the foreign jade shop, nicknamed Short Xiao Wang. At the time of the engagement, the Wang family paid 40 yuan as betrothal money. However, Wang soon lost his job and his personal life became difficult, let alone getting married. Xiaomei's mother changed her mind and remarried her to a man from Pudong named Zhou Heshang. They were married in January of last year according to the lunar calendar.</p>
<p>Negotiated solution: Seeing that he had lost both the woman and the money, Short Xiao Wang felt resentful and invited his friends Tang Gengquan and Chen Runsheng (nicknamed Short Cai, who also runs a dental inlay shop in the City God Temple) to reason with the Chen family. After mediation, the Chen family agreed to return 50 yuan to Wang as compensation. At the time, 30 yuan was paid, with 20 yuan still owed. It was agreed to meet at the Deyi Teahouse in the City God Temple at 10:00 AM yesterday. Tang Gengquan and Chen Runsheng were called from the Wang family's residence, and Wu Chunzhi, the owner of Huayang Restaurant at 154 Fuyou Road, and an acquaintance of Wu, were invited from the Chen family's residence, along with Chen Xiaomei, to sort out the matter from three sides. Chen Xiaomei handed over 15 yuan to Tang and others, while Tang Gengquan, the representative of Wang, handed over the "eight characters" betrothal card. However, Short Xiao Wang was not present at the time.</p>
<p>Screams for help from the restaurant: After the negotiations were clear, everyone dispersed. Xiaomei went to the Fuxin Tobacco Company on Kangti Road to collect her wages of 1 yuan and 10 cents, and returned to the Huayang Restaurant on Fuyou Road to talk to Wu Chunzhi. Unexpectedly, her former fiancé Short Xiao Wang was already there. Seeing Xiaomei approaching, he also followed her in. He met Wu Chunzhi and spoke a few words to him, then asked Wu to go upstairs for a private talk. Wu did not suspect anything at the time, and the two went upstairs. Xiaomei waited downstairs. Shortly after the two went upstairs, screams of fighting were heard from upstairs, and Wu cried for help.</p>
<p>Blade covered in blood: Before Wu finished calling for help, Xiao Wang had already rushed downstairs in a panic. He was seen holding a six-inch blade in his hand, covered in blood. He ran straight out the door, while Wu also chased after him, trying to confront him. Seeing that the situation was not good, Wang threw the blade aside and fled without a trace. When Wu chased out of the store, he collapsed to the ground from his injuries, covered in blood. Neighbors gathered after hearing the alarm, but only saw that Wu had two knife wounds, one on the left abdomen and one on the right chest. His intestines had spilled out and he died shortly after.</p>
<p>Deceased awaiting autopsy: After the incident, Gao Wanling, a police officer from the 14th post of the 2nd section of the 1st district, arrived after hearing the alarm. However, the murderer had already fled far away. He immediately reported to the police station, and Chief Yi immediately led a team of police officers to the scene for investigation. Chen Xiaomei, the main person involved, and Li Zhenxiang, a friend of the murderer, were arrested and taken to the station for interrogation. The deceased, Wu Chunzhi, was a 31-year-old man from Yangzhou. Huayang Restaurant was opened by him and his friend Chen Lide as a joint venture. The store was opened in January of this year, initially selling wine. Later, due to poor business, it was converted into a noodle restaurant. After the interrogation, Chief Yi immediately ordered the local police chief to report to the court for an autopsy. He also ordered his subordinates to strictly apprehend the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Driver Extorts Owner After Being Dismissed</h3>
<p>Three letters demanding 30,000 yuan</p>
<p>Meeting arranged on Route Ferguson</p>
<p>Arrested while negotiating</p>
<p>Li Weinong, a native of Changshu, residing at 907 Weihaiwei Road, worked as a clerk at the Anmao Foreign Firm on Jiangxi Road. His monthly income was not substantial, yet he was also targeted by bandits. On April 30th, a letter was sent to Li's residence, stating that the party was experiencing financial difficulties and, upon the order of Commander Ma Yushan, was requesting a loan of 15,000 yuan from him. At the time, Li had already taken leave and returned to his hometown, and his family ignored the matter. On June 12th, the bandits sent another letter to Li, demanding money, but the amount had increased to 30,000 yuan. They also stated that if he was sincere, he should write a blood character on red paper and stick it at the entrance of his residence. Li had already returned to Shanghai from his hometown and sent the two letters to the News Police Station for investigation. The police chief ordered Li to act according to the instructions in the letter to observe the situation. After the red paper was posted, there was no response at first. It was not until the 25th of this month that the bandits replied, saying that the red paper had been seen. They requested that another red paper with the word "True" be written on it and pasted in the original place. They also requested that the money be placed in a straw bag and sent by a person wearing black clothes in a yellow rickshaw to the wilderness at the end of Route Ferguson in the French Concession between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM on the 27th. Someone would receive it. Li reported the letter to the police again. On the appointed day, the police chief dispatched detectives Deng Jingfan, Yang Xinzheng, Liu Longchao, and others disguised as steelworkers to lie in ambush around the designated location. Li had his servant Zhu Zisheng change into black clothes, carry a straw bag filled with newspapers, and go by rickshaw. Upon arrival, a Chongming man named Huang Huiming came from elsewhere, scrutinized Zhu, looked around, and greeted Zhu. The detectives then arrested Huang and brought him back to the police station. After interrogation, they went to 550 Dalianwan Road and arrested another accomplice named Ji Ziqing. Yesterday morning, both were sent to the Special District Court, where Judge Ge interrogated them. Li Weinong stated the circumstances of receiving the three threatening letters and claimed that Ji Ziqing was originally his rickshaw driver and was dismissed because he had a conflict with the maid on April 13th. Huang Huiming confessed that he had an brother-in-law named Ji Shirong, who was a rickshaw driver for the Xu family at 44 Chongqing Road. On the 26th of this month, he met him on the road and was invited to his home for lunch. Ji Ziqing was also present. After the meal, Shirong asked him to go to his house again the next morning. He went as agreed. Shirong took him to the end of Route Ferguson and stopped, ordering him to go forward to scout for anyone carrying a straw bag. He did not know his intention and went forward alone. He saw a man carrying a straw bag standing on the side of the road. He was about to turn back to report to Shirong, but was arrested. Ji Ziqing denied everything in his confession. Judge Ge stated that the case still needed to be investigated and ordered the two defendants to be detained pending further interrogation on July 7th.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Assaults Wife of a Road Worker</h3>
<p>Abusing power and committing violence, the road worker is injured</p>
<p>Public outrage leads to dismissal</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a dispute occurred between a police officer at the Shanghai North Railway Station and a road worker at the station. Fortunately, it was resolved early, and the matter was settled. The day before yesterday (the 28th) was the payday for the station's workers. A road worker named Wu Shengrong had just been transferred from Nanjing Station to work in Shanghai. As he was unfamiliar with everything, he did not know that it was payday that day. When the other road workers informed him, he understood. However, according to the regulations, workers must have their name chop and a salary certificate with a photo to collect their salary. Wu Shengrong had left his at home and asked someone to inform his wife to bring it. He then went outside the station to buy food to satisfy his hunger. When he returned to the train platform, he saw a police officer (No. 33) blocking his wife's path, harassing her. The road worker saw this and immediately questioned the officer, stating that his wife had come to bring the salary certificate and should not be treated lightly. Unexpectedly, the police officer responded with abusive words, falsely accusing them of not being a formal couple and cursing loudly. After a brief argument, the police officer slapped Wu Shengrong several times and then punched and kicked him. As a result, his face and other parts of his body were injured. Everyone present was outraged, believing that police officers and workers both served the railway and should help each other. It was uncalled for to insult the worker for no reason. They sent the injured Wu Shengrong to the railway hospital for examination and treatment and planned to report the matter to the chief of the train station and have the police officer punished. However, the day before yesterday was Sunday, and the railway bureau's offices were closed as usual. Therefore, the workers went on strike at 10:00 AM yesterday and went to see the chief of the train station to report the incident and demand appropriate action. After the two chiefs learned of the incident, they summoned the head of the responsible police division. The head of the division replied to the workers' representatives that the offending police officer would be dismissed immediately. The workers were satisfied and returned to their posts, and the turmoil subsided.</p>
<h3>Special Vegetarian Meals on Two Railway Lines</h3>
<p>The Shanghai World Buddhist Laymen's Association, considering that the supply of dishes and rice for passengers on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway dining cars is convenient, but there are also quite a few vegetarians these days. During travel, it's inconvenient because there are no vegetarian options available on the train. Therefore, they suggested to the two railway bureaus the other day that vegetarian meals be provided on each train. The railway bureaus adopted this suggestion and it will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Anhui Official Allowed to Post Bail</h3>
<p>Ordered to return to Anhui to settle accounts</p>
<p>Wang Shaoyi, the magistrate of Lai'an County, Anhui Province, embezzled public funds and fled to Shanghai, staying at the Dadong Hotel on Nanjing Road. The Anhui Provincial Government telegraphed the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to arrest him nearby. He was arrested by Chief Chen of the Public Security Bureau and detectives, along with the officers from the Old Zhabei Police Station. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Wang's position as magistrate of Lai'an County was relinquished in June of the 18th year of the Republic. The embezzled public funds of 9,727 yuan were also outstanding debts that had not been settled at the time of his departure. Yesterday morning, the police sent Wang to the Special District Court, where Judge Xu held the trial. According to Wang's confession, he left his post first due to other important matters, and all transfer procedures were handled by the accounting director Chen Xianglun on his behalf. He is currently serving as the head of the opium suppression office in Yucheng, Henan. Recently, he received an official letter from the Anhui Provincial Department of Finance, stating that the funds handled during his tenure in Lai'an had not been properly transferred and he was ordered to settle the matter. Therefore, he came to Shanghai from Henan, intending to go to Anhui to clarify that the funds were not embezzled. In fact, he had advanced over 5,000 yuan for the purchase of weapons at the time, and he had also advanced a considerable amount of funds for bandit suppression, which should be used to offset the amount. Judge Xu reviewed the confession and ordered Wang Shaoyi to provide a 10,000 yuan cash bond or a shop bond and return to Anhui to settle the matter himself.</p>
<h3>Notorious Zhejiang Bandit Fei Jianzai Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government dispatched detectives to Shanghai the day before yesterday with documents reporting to the French police that a notorious bandit named Fei Jianzai from Shaoxing, also known as Fei Dezhao, had repeatedly committed kidnapping cases in Zhejiang and other places. After the case was exposed, he fled to Shanghai and hid in Shuanggui Lane, Du Shenfu Road, under their jurisdiction, requesting assistance in arresting him for prosecution. The police chief approved the request and immediately ordered a detective to assist in arresting Fei. Yesterday, he was sent to the French Court for preliminary hearing. According to the detectives' report, they requested permission to transfer and interrogate him. The defendant's lawyer, Zhang Aicang, stated that the lawyer was not yet aware of the details of the case and requested a postponement for further hearing.

He then kidnapped the seven-year-old son of wealthy merchant Zheng Desan and extorted 300 yuan. After the incident, the local Public Security Bureau ordered its subordinates to strictly arrest him, but the bandit remained at large. Unexpectedly, the detectives of the Shanghai Liaison Office of the Jiangsu Pacification Supervisory Office, led by Ding Guang, discovered that Chen was hiding in the Weiji Barber Shop at 1017 Xinmin Road, Zhabei. The four-district headquarters were informed the day before yesterday, and police officers were dispatched to secretly arrest Chen at the shop.

<p>Zhu Zhongyi, a 46-year-old local, was alone and worked as a coolie at the Nissin Company wharf in Hongkou to make a living. He was extremely poor and miserable. Recently, due to his age and illness, his work became difficult, leading to a reduction in his income. He often faced the threat of starvation. He felt sorry for himself and became disgusted with life. The day before yesterday afternoon, he boarded sampan No. 1399 at the wharf, claiming to go to Pudong. When they reached the middle of the river, he jumped into the water to commit suicide. Fortunately, the sampan operator rescued him and sent him to the Customs Police Station.

A British warship was docked nearby, and the sailors on board saw it and immediately launched a motorboat to rescue the man. They notified the Customs Water Police Station by telephone. Detective Wu Rongsheng boarded the ship and took him back to the police station. He confessed that his name was Bao Heming, 22 years old, from Wuxi, and lived at 31 Shunxingfang, Tiantong Temple Road, Zhabei. He committed suicide to end his troubles due to economic hardship.

<h3>Young Woman Runs Away, Accuses Husband of Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Xu Guoren, police chief of the Jinyi Precinct of the Second Branch of the Sixth District of Xuhui, Shanghai, received a report around 9 PM the night before last from Jiang Wang, a woman from Yancheng. She claimed that in July of the previous autumn, she was threatened with a gun by Zhou Guancheng, a bandit from her hometown, and forcibly brought to Shanghai. She was hidden at No. 7 Yiban Road near Haichao Temple in the Nanshi area. On the 21st of this month, they moved to No. 2614 Heping Li on Xiexu Road, where she was closely guarded day and night and unable to escape. The day before yesterday, taking advantage of a slight lapse in security, she managed to flee. However, she was caught and brought back in the Xiejiao area. Zhou's friend, Qi Yubin, aided and abetted the abuse, locking her up and severely beating her, leaving her covered in bruises. Now, they were planning to sell her off. Therefore, she seized an opportunity to escape last night and sought help. She also stated that Zhou had committed multiple gun-related crimes in their hometown. Police Chief Xu immediately arrested Zhou Guancheng and Qi Yubin, along with Jiang Wang, and sent all three to the station for investigation. After a preliminary hearing conducted by Police Chief Liu, the plaintiff, Jiang Wang, testified that she was 21 years old, from Yancheng, and detailed the events as described above. Zhou Guancheng, 25 years old, also from Yancheng, testified that he made a living as a rickshaw puller. On June 18th of the previous year, through matchmakers Cao Shousheng and Zhou Anbai, he married the daughter of Hu Wenshu in their hometown. They moved to Shanghai in the autumn. However, the plaintiff was extremely promiscuous and did not uphold her wifely duties. On February 26th of this year, at 7 PM, she ran away and eloped. On the 20th of this month, he discovered that the plaintiff had been seduced by Xu Lao San, a worker at the Sanxing Silk Weaving Factory on Meixie Road. He immediately reported this to the factory manager, who suspended Xu. Zhou then took the plaintiff back into his custody, fearing that Xu would entice her again, and moved to Heping Li. He administered a slight beating, hoping she would change her ways. Now, the plaintiff, being reprimanded, was falsely accusing him of being a bandit. Qi Yubin, 27 years old, residing in Qili Lane, west of Haichao Temple, testified that he did not participate in the beating, only slightly admonished her, and knew nothing else about the matter. Based on the testimonies, Police Chief Liu concluded that the accounts of both parties were contradictory, the situation was complex, and the defendants wife had a different surname than the plaintiff. Therefore, he ordered that the plaintiff and defendants be sent to the bureau for further handling.</p>
<h3>Zhang Wenrui's Heartbroken Account of Losing Her Virginity</h3>
<p>Why is Wang Runlai so heartless?</p>
<p>Zhang Wenrui, a 24-year-old woman from Songjiang, was deeply loved by her parents while they were alive. She was not yet married. Unfortunately, her parents passed away one after another, leaving behind a few acres of thin land. Because she could not cultivate it herself, it gradually became barren, and her livelihood became difficult. Last autumn, the woman came to Shanghai and resided with her relative at No. 42 Deshan Li on Avenue Dubail. She intended to find work as a seamstress. However, she was seduced by Wang Runlai, the son of Wang Jisheng, who owns the Leguzhai Antique Shop in the citys Huayuan Li, and they fell in love. Later, they built a small home in the pavilion of No. 215 Shiyuli on Avenue Eduard VII, living together like husband and wife. Runlai's love for the woman deepened, and they secretly vowed to be together forever. They lived in seclusion for more than half a year, never returning home. All daily expenses were covered by Wenrui, who, believing she was already Runlai's wife, returned to her hometown and sold all her land to support their life together. On May 2nd of the lunar calendar, Runlai was suddenly found by his father</p>
<p>and forced to return home. By the 9th, Runlai had escaped again and was staying with Wenrui in Room 8 of the Huidong Hotel on Avenue Eduard VII. Unexpectedly, the other day, Runlai's legal wife arrived and created a huge scene, violently beating Wenrui. She immediately took Runlai back home. Wenrui, reflecting on her mistake, realized that she had lost her virginity to Runlai, ruining her reputation. The land left by her parents had been sold off. She was also four months pregnant. Now, she had suffered this humiliation. Looking ahead, her future seemed bleak and uncertain. She conceived the idea of suicide, weeping all night. Yesterday morning, she went out and bought a large amount of opium, secretly swallowed it, and lay crying on the bed, tears streaming down her face. A waiter named A Si noticed through a crack in the window and immediately reported it to the front desk, who managed to open the room. They found Wenrui covered in vomit and immediately rushed her to Renji Hospital. After receiving injections and treatment from the doctor, she remained in critical condition. The hospital reported the incident to the police, who dispatched a detective to the hospital to investigate. Later, in Room 8 of the Huidong Hotel, they found a suicide note written by Wenrui, addressed to Wang Runlai, in which her words were extremely sad. It is unknown whether she will survive.</p>
<h3>Tang Wanzhen Injured by Nitric Acid</h3>
<p>Tang Wanzhen, a woman from Haimen residing at No. 52 Tongxing Road in Wusong, was in her early twenties and quite beautiful. Last year, she married a man named Yuan from the same village. However, due to differences of opinion, they separated this spring. Unexpectedly, around 9:20 the night before last, as Wanzhen was walking past the Tianlun Silk and Satin Bureau on Songxing Road, a person suddenly jumped out from the shadows, holding a bottle of nitric acid, and poured it on Wanzhen's head. The person, seeing that their goal was achieved, fled. Wanzhen collapsed from the pain and was taken to the Haibin Hospital on Wusong Wai Ma Road for treatment. Her face was severely injured and completely swollen, with signs of ulceration. It is feared that it will take a long time to heal. The reason for the incident is believed to be jealousy, leading someone to resort to such a cruel act.</p>
<h3>Anhui Su County Reports Disaster, Appeals for Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee received an official letter from the Su County Hail Disaster Relief Committee in Anhui Province. It stated: "We weep with sorrow, for misfortune has befallen the people of Su County, with repeated major disasters. Last year, when the wheat was about to ripen, it was damaged by wind. In the autumn, there was a major flood, which inundated much of the farmland. This spring, before the harvest, 90% of the population lacked food. Sources were scarce, and there was no way to buy it. In the cities, relief in the form of rice and flour was available, but it could not alleviate the high price of flour. In the countryside, people subsisted on weeds, which barely provided enough to eat. They could only barely survive, waiting for the season to change. As summer approached, we rejoiced at the prospect of harvesting the wheat, which was about to ripen, and thought that we would soon have enough to eat. Unexpectedly, the heavens unleashed another disaster, a catastrophic event. Suddenly, on the afternoon of May 31st, hail fell, lasting for about an hour. Some hailstones were as small as goose eggs, others as large as rice bowls, and some were even the size of soccer balls. The ground was covered to a depth of several inches. From the northwest to the southeast, the area affected was about twenty li wide and one hundred li long. In all districts of the county, the wheat crop was completely destroyed. All the wheat stalks were scattered by the wind and carried away by the flood, benefiting only the birds. Only the roots, barely an inch above the ground, remained. Not only was the food that was about to be harvested snatched away, but firewood and cattle feed were also gone. The newly planted autumn seedlings were also destroyed. Furthermore, the wind added to the devastation, blowing off roofs and sending tiles flying. People and animals died in the fields, piled on top of each other. People were struck dead by the hail, blown into ditches, and their bodies were revealed as the ice melted. There were such scenes everywhere. With no hope of a wheat harvest and no ability to plant autumn crops, small landowners were instantly reduced to poverty, and poor families considered suicide. As a result, people were displaced and wandered along the roads, with children wailing and women crying, a constant sound in the air. The tragic situation is all true, without any exaggeration. It is an unprecedented disaster. Therefore, we have publicly appointed representatives Ma Xiaotang and Chen Haishan to visit and personally present our case, imploring you to provide relief to save these disaster-stricken people."</p>

<h3>News from Various Labor Unions</h3>
<p>Various Labor Unions: The Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union, Municipal Postal Workers Union, Fifth District Shipbuilding Industry Union, Fifth District Cotton Weaving Industry Union, Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Wooden Boat Industry Union, Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Local Yellow Wine Industry Union, Preparatory Committee of the Fifth District Match Industry Union, Preparatory Committee of the Fifth District Carpentry Industry Union, and more than 40 other labor unions issued a declaration against the Jinxin Factory's oppression of workers. It stated that the Jinxin Cloth Factory in Nanshi has dismissed workers without cause. Although the Social Affairs Bureau has mediated several times, the factory has refused to accept the mediation and has not indicated any intention to submit to arbitration. The government's order to reinstate the workers should have been strictly implemented, but for two months, the factory has defied the order. Recently, it has even used force to prevent workers from entering the factory for food and lodging. These unions believe that the employer's actions are extremely illegal. In addition to expressing unlimited sympathy for the workers of the factory, they hope that the authorities will quickly mediate impartially to avoid causing unemployment and will impose severe sanctions on employers who violate government orders, in order to maintain labor rights and serve as a warning to those who disregard laws. This declaration is hereby issued.</p>
<p>The First District Cotton Weaving Industry Labor Union issued a declaration yesterday, stating that the Jinxin Cloth Factory, out of resentment for workers joining the labor union, dismissed worker representatives Yao Zushun and six others without cause on May 4th, cutting off their food and lodging and expelling them from the factory. During the several mediations by the Social Affairs Bureau, the employer showed no sincerity and offered no reasonable explanation. After the order to reinstate the workers, they did not comply and did not raise any objections. When the Social Affairs Bureau forwarded a letter to the Public Security Bureau for enforcement, the employer, in conjunction with the industry association, filed a complaint against Wang Shui of the Social Affairs Bureau by express mail and telegram. At that time, in order to avoid escalating the labor unrest, the union, together with the industry association, reached a settlement. However, the union made concessions while the other party raised their demands. As a result, the settlement fell apart. Later, the municipal government approved the Public Security Bureau to enforce the order again. After several attempts to send police escorts to reinstate the workers, they were forcibly expelled. Since then, two months have passed. During these two months, innocent workers have suffered from unemployment, hunger, and cold. They have pawned everything and have no way to borrow money. Their appearance is emaciated and miserable. However, the union and the workers have endured until now, waiting for the government to investigate and deal with the matter according to law. Now, the employer treats government laws as child's play, disregarding the workers' lives. This is not only unreasonable, but also inhumane. In order to protect the interests of the workers and implement government laws, the union is determined to sacrifice and fight to the death. Because its power is limited, it hopes that all sectors of society will provide assistance to maintain the credibility of the government and relieve the workers' suffering. This declaration is hereby issued.</p>

<h3>Gleanings from the Country</h3>
<p>— Shi Nong</p>
<p>The Qiantang River cannot be crossed at night. If crossed at night, winds and waves will surely arise, leading to the danger of capsizing. Even tugboats cannot avoid this. To this day, no one dares to cross it at night.</p>
<p>The Qiantang tidal bore is highest in mid-July, doubling the height of the full moon tide in August. However, it is a chaotic tide. The reliable tide in August features thousands of bright lights floating on the water surface at night (mostly placed by people near the opposite bank), moving back and forth with the tide. During the day, hundreds and thousands of seabirds can be seen flying in flocks a hundred zhang ahead of the tidal bore.</p>
<p>There are no mosquitoes in Fengyang. Legend has it that mosquitoes avoid the imperial edict of Zhu Yuanzhang.</p>
<p>The frogs within the city of Jinan do not croak. If frogs from within the city are taken outside the city, their croaking is deafening. If frogs from outside the city are brought inside, they fall silent again.</p>
<p>In the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, within the Military Books and Precious Swords Gorge, one can see a red box within the thousand-foot cliffs. It is said to have been placed by Zhuge Liang, containing military books and precious swords. To this day, many have tried to retrieve it but have failed.</p>
<p>In the Zhang Fei Temple within the city of Yunyang, Sichuan, Zhang Fei's head is stored in an oil well behind the altar. If dozens of catties of vegetable oil are added, it will rise above the well opening and become visible.</p>
<h3>Wu Peifu's Journey Out of Sichuan</h3>
<p>— Cheng Junsong</p>
<p>News of Wu Peifu's departure from Sichuan has been circulating for a long time, but it has recently faded into silence. Perhaps news from Sichuan is slow to arrive? Recently, a friend came from Chengdu and provided a detailed account of Wu's movements. I will quickly record it below.</p>
<p>After his military defeat, Wu Peifu retreated to eastern Sichuan. The years passed by, and two years have already passed. His former ambitions have been worn away, and he now only cultivates flowers and reads paintings. His desolate situation is almost like that of Du Shaoling (Du Fu) when he depended on Yan Wu. Recently, he felt a lack of interest in living under someone else's roof and longed to return to his native Penglai to rest and recuperate. Moreover, he has become a figure of the past in politics, and no faction harbors any suspicion towards him. Therefore, with the consent of the central government, he was allowed to leave Sichuan. Wu packed his belongings and, with his wife and over 400 staff members, set off from Xiaba Temple Town in Xuanhan County on May 13th. The next day, he arrived in Suiding. A certain gentleman paid a visit and, after a pleasant conversation, presented him with a single piece of calligraphy in cursive script, which read, "One year to plant grain, ten years to plant trees, a hundred years to cultivate people, a thousand years to cultivate virtue." Below, it was inscribed, "Aiming for the top, you only get the middle; aiming for the middle, you only get the bottom; aiming for the bottom, you get nothing at all." From this, Wu's breadth of mind can be seen. He stayed in Suiding for several days and then, on the 24th, went to Guang'an. He arrived on the 26th. The area is under the control of Yang Sen, and Yang sent personnel to take care of and protect him along the way. When I (the friend speaking) left Sichuan, Wu was still there and seemed to not have departed yet. As for Wu's subsequent journey, it is said that he will take the route through Shunqing and Tongchuan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Qingcheng Mountain and Emei Mountain. He plans to visit Emei Mountain for ten days, to explore the beauty of the mountains and rivers, and then take the route through Jiading, Xufu, Luzhou, Chongqing, and Wanxian, traveling by boat to Yichang. From there, he will pass through Wuhan and the capital, arriving in Shanghai, visiting West Lake in Hangzhou, and then returning to Penglai. Based on the time, if there are no unexpected obstacles, he should be able to shake hands with people in Shanghai in July.</p>
<p>Also, during the Lantern Festival in my hometown, there is often a practice of hanging tiger lanterns and guessing riddles. There are two telegrams about Wu that are relevant to this article. One is "Wu Peifu's Recent Situation," with the riddle being a Tang poem: "Now it is not like the time in Luoyang." The other is "Wu Peifu Regains Momentum," with the riddle being a passage from Zuo Zhuan: "The son arrived to restore the army." The former expresses regret for Wu's desolate situation, while the latter predicts Wu's comeback. However, from the perspective of Wu, who has experienced so much hardship, he probably no longer has such thoughts.</p>
<h3>Record of the American Newspaper Industry Film Screening</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>In recent years, publications in our country have gradually flourished. The creation of newspapers has spread from urban areas to the interior. News education has also gradually gained attention. For example, universities have established journalism departments and formed journalism associations, and have sent personnel abroad to specialize in journalism or to investigate the newspaper industry. This is truly a dawn for the newspaper industry's future. We can generally talk about the development of the newspaper industry in various countries. However, what we know is based on hearsay rather than personal observation. The actual situation is not something that those who have not experienced it firsthand can fully understand. This time, Mr. Powell, the Shanghai-based reporter for the Chicago Tribune (and also the chief writer for the Miller's Review of the Far East), specially introduced a photographic film of the newspaper, "From Trees to Tribunes," which was screened in Shanghai to meet with our press. This allows us to know a glimpse of the American newspaper industry. His kindness is truly commendable.</p>
<p>After the film was transported to Shanghai, Mr. Powell wrote to the Shanghai Newspaper Association to preside over the event. This association is the central hub of various newspapers, aiming to increase the benefits of those in the press. They selected the Nanjing Grand Theater to hold the screening at 11:30 a.m. on the 28th, and gave tickets to employees of Chinese and foreign newspapers, news agencies, advertising companies, and those not in the press. At that time, attendance was extremely enthusiastic, with about 1,500 Chinese and foreign dignitaries. Mr. Kong Xiangxi also attended. It is said that there were two sections in the film about afforestation and papermaking, which are closely related to the Ministry of Industry. Mr. Kong's arrival may have been for this reason. At the time of the screening, Mr. Wang Yingbin of Shen Bao broadcasted via radio, first thanking Mr. Powell and the theater owner for their kind intentions, and then translating the main ideas of the film.</p>
<p>The film is divided into three reels. The first reel shows mountains and forests, with dense shade covering the sky. Workers with axes or saws enter the forest to cut down trees, which are cut into segments and thrown into streams. They flow down with the rapids, reaching the harbor and then being transported to the newspaper's own paper mill. The second reel shows the papermaking process. First, the wood is ground into sawdust by machine, mixed with chemical agents, and turned into wood pulp. After several refining and remanufacturing processes, it becomes fine, clean newsprint, which is transported to the newspaper office, all the way until it is put into the printing press. The third reel shows the work inside the newspaper office. There are many people in the editorial department, and the work is intense. The completed drafts are sent to the typesetting room. Typesetting is also done mechanically, like typing. Other departments, such as composing, paper cutting, copper plate casting, lead plate casting, and printing, work incredibly fast. After the newspapers are printed, they are automatically transported to the distribution department. Newspaper vendors, at the break of dawn, brave the stars and the moon, rushing to the market to sell newspapers. Another part goes directly from the printing press to the packaging room, also using machines for packaging, in preparation for sending to the post office for mailing. Those transported by boat or vehicle are all packed and sent to the station, port, or airport. Seeing the convenience of transportation, one realizes the close relationship between transportation and life. This newspaper sells over one million copies daily, and doubles that on Sundays. Its grand scale and perfect organization go without saying. Even considering the newspaper office building, the forty-plus-story building soars into the clouds, magnificent and majestic, making people feel a sense of awe.</p>
<h3>Interesting Anecdotes About Matches</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>The matches we use daily are commonly called "foreign fire" or "self-igniting fire," probably because this item originally came from overseas, hence the addition of the word "foreign." Matches have traditionally been divided into red-tipped and black-tipped. Black-tipped matches are safer, and it is not easy to ignite them without rubbing them hard. However, when the box is full of matches, if the lid is not tightly closed, and one takes out a match and rubs it against the exposed head on the side of the box, in dry weather, a little carelessness can easily cause the entire box to catch fire, burning one's fingers. Even if one waves one's hand quickly, it is not easy to get rid of it. Many of my friends have suffered skin burns due to slight carelessness. This is also something that match users should pay attention to. Red-tipped matches contain the most phosphorus and are even more dangerous. In recent years, they have gradually become less common in the market. According to a British magazine, there is an interesting anecdote about the cessation of red-tipped match production in that country.</p>
<p>This matter was mentioned by Mr. Riddell, a member of the British Parliament, in a recent speech to the Public Health Committee. He said that the earliest matches contained a high amount of phosphorus. Phosphorus is not only highly explosive, but also easily enters the human body during its preparation, causing phosphorus necrosis and severely eroding the bones. One of Mr. Riddell's friends was an expert in match manufacturing. When he was young, he occasionally followed his father to visit the match factory. He was greatly shocked by a dark room. In a corner of the room sat a worker, his face glowing brightly in the darkness, a terrifying sight. Upon inquiry, he learned that the worker had been working for many years and was deeply poisoned by phosphorus. All the bones of his face had absorbed phosphorus, resulting in this phenomenon. Feeling sympathy, the friend later inherited his father's business and immediately decided to stop the production of red-tipped matches, repeatedly stating their harms in order to obtain the consent of other companies in the industry. The public, after being promoted by him, also refrained from using them. For a time, red-tipped matches disappeared from the British market.</p>
<h3>Groundbreaking Ceremony for Martyr Xiong Chengji's Memorial Park</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Martyr Xiong Chengji of Jiangdu raised an army in Anqing and died for his cause in Dong Province. More than twenty years have passed. Now, under the request of Central Committee member Wang Boling and others, the Central Government and the Provincial Government have suggested building a shrine at the Guanyuan Garden on the shore of Slender West Lake in Yangzhou. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on June 28th. A posthumous portrait of the martyr when he was captured in Harbin has been found, along with a short biography to introduce him to the people of the country.</p>
<p>The martyr's given name was Chengji, courtesy name Weigen, from Jiangdu. He graduated from the Naval Artillery Academy's officer training program. In the thirty-fourth year of the Guangxu reign of the fallen Qing Dynasty, the martyr was a team officer in the 9th Artillery Battalion. He raised an army in Anqing during the autumn maneuvers, fled to Tongcheng, went to Qingdao, and crossed over to Japan. In the first year of the Xuantong reign, he arrived in Changchun, changing his name to Yi Longqian, courtesy name Wangyun, planning a major uprising. He resided with the Zang Guan San families. Zang came from banditry, and his son, Keming, conspired with him in Japan. Guan San repeatedly extorted money from him. He then went to Harbin. Just as Prince Qing Xun returned from Europe, the martyr planned to assassinate him on the way. Guan San informed the authorities, and he was arrested. This was on the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month of the lunar calendar before the founding of the Republic of China. He died for his cause in Jilin Province the following year. He was only twenty-four years old. His coffin was placed in the Sanjiang Guild Hall. In the second year of the Republic of China, he was finally buried at the foot of Pingshan Hall in Jiangdu. Now that the Party-State has been established, more than twenty years have passed, and those who visit the martyr's tomb only feel a sense of fragrant grass in the evening sun, almost forgetting the martyr Xiong, who had the indomitable spirit of the first uprising. Therefore, there is something to be admired.</p>
<h3>Travelogue to India (57)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>Speaking of Gandhi's movement, the Muslims also very much approve of it, saying that it has been quite successful. The villagers can also resist taxes. For example, the salt tax originally did not allow the poor to sell salt. Now this system has been broken, and the British government can do nothing. People can freely sell salt, and the government has difficulty managing it one by one. Tax resistance also exists in various places. As far as I know, people are very free in various parts of Myanmar. The same is true in India, because indirect management is quite difficult to be thorough. I heard that the Siamese government's management is quite strict because it is direct management. I see the matter of the Muslims fasting. Some people are very serious about it depending on their personalities, while others are not. I met a student who bought fruit in the garden and gave me two pieces, keeping two for himself. I asked why he wasn't eating now. He replied that he had to wait until evening to eat because he was fasting during the day. He seemed very serious. But others ate breakfast, eating with me, showing that it is not easy to be uniform. Speaking of the conflicts between Indians and Muslims, the Indian laws are very high and pure, maintaining themselves and not interacting with others. In contrast, I have never heard of conflicts in Chinese Islam, because they have assimilated. Indian religions are noble and strict. Not only do they not intermarry with others, but they also do not socialize with others. It is very difficult to practice their custom of worshiping cows. No matter how noble, it is difficult to promote it everywhere. I respect and pity them, but it is difficult to learn from them.</p>
<p>India is peaceful, and the people are content and obedient. The shops do not have outer walls, and they are scattered. At night, there is no door to close. Everything is free. If you were in China, you couldn't take a step. Those who live in India for a long time become peaceful. The city is clean, and the roads are wide and new, like Lahore. The Westerners are good at governing the city government but not good at governing the countryside. This is why the farmers and workers are poor and start revolutions.</p>
<p>On the 21st, several professors from the Mathematics Society, including Benay Char, invited me to dinner. There was also a Frenchman. The Frenchman was very weak, not at all like the French people in our ideals, who should all be like Napoleon. Benay Char is a talented woman. She showed me that she belongs to the new Protestant sect in India, which does not adhere to the old sect. They have created a copper badge with a lotus flower, a swastika, the letter "A," and a crescent moon, indicating that it is a religion of universal harmony. This sect is quite popular in India today. I told the members that I like mathematics, physics, and philosophy, but I cannot be a true student of mathematics because I am very afraid of it. I heard that there was a flower exhibition, but I couldn't go.</p>
<p>One thing worth noting in this city is that the street names on each street are made in very large characters and engraved on the roadside. The street signs in the streets I have passed in various countries are not clear, not even as good as Shanghai and Nanjing, but this city is special, making it very convenient for pedestrians to recognize. However, there are only numbers on the doorplates and no street names, which is still inconvenient. That day, a businessman, Mr. Liu Songchu, came to invite me again. I see that the young people love to read and have ideas.</p>

<h3>??? (7)</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>Zi Liang saw that she was going to pester him again and wouldn't leave, and became anxious: "Hurry up and go downstairs! I'm hungry, I haven't eaten anything since I got up early in the morning. Have you prepared the porridge?"</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the wife showed a surprised expression and looked at her husband:</p>
<p>"You want to eat porridge?"</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't I want to eat?"</p>
<p>"That's strange! I just ladled the porridge downstairs, and kept calling you down to eat, but you ignored me. I finished the porridge all by myself, and now you suddenly want to eat it."</p>
<p>"Then, what do I eat? Starve?"</p>
<p>Zi Liang got angry, his face flushed red, his stomach rumbling. At this moment, the wife suddenly laughed: "Haha! Are you not a child? You get angry when you hear there's nothing to eat? Don't worry! Your beloved wife, Ms. Yueru, definitely can't bear to let you go hungry. When the nanny comes back, I'll have her buy you some snacks to eat!"</p>
<p>"Are there any crackers left?"</p>
<p>Zi Liang's anger subsided a little, and the wife smiled sweetly again:</p>
<p>"Crackers? There are only meat ones, do you want them or not?"</p>
<p>"Meat ones?"</p>
<p>"The crackers have weevils in them, haven't they become meat crackers?"</p>
<p>"That's outrageous!"</p>
<p>"They're very delicious!"</p>
<p>The wife giggled, and Zi Liang turned his head away, ignoring her. The wife then took a step forward:</p>
<p>"Old Man Wang's obituary says the wake is the day after tomorrow. What kind of gift should we send?"</p>
<p>"A funeral couplet!"</p>
<p>"You always send funeral couplets. A funeral couplet is only worth forty cents. How can you give it away? When my father died, you, the son-in-law in mourning, also sent a funeral couplet."</p>
<p>Zi Liang became impatient and stood up, waving his hand:</p>
<p>"Downstairs..."</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Fall and Rise Again</h3>
<p>Ending with a Rise of Fourteen Taels</p>
<p>Fluctuations of Thirty-Four Taels Throughout the City. Yesterday, the 29th, the changes in gold prices became more intense. The initial fatigue of the money market led to an even stronger rebound. The difference throughout the city reached thirty-three or thirty-four taels. In the end, it rose fourteen taels. The situation was chaotic and unpredictable, and it was difficult to predict the dangerous storms. People were frightened and could not be suppressed. Early trading saw a sharp drop of more than ten taels, breaking through the 700-tael mark. This was because the silver market had risen, and there was good news that France might not oppose the extension of war debts, leading to a low market price. Later, foreign exchange went from loose to tight, and major players in the market fiercely competed to buy, pushing the price higher and higher, soaring upwards, rising sharply by more than twenty taels. Only small traders occasionally watched. By noon, it had exceeded 700 taels. The situation in the afternoon was slightly rotational, which was even better. The silver market was bearish.</p>
<p>Silver Prices Fell Sharply at the Open. From an opening price of 686.5 taels in the morning of August, it immediately fell by 15.5 taels. The large averages rose by 3/8 the previous day, and silver prices rose by 6/8. Moreover, the European market was strong, and private telegrams also increased by 1/2. As for Wan Yu, Shunli, Yuan Cheng, Yong, etc., they all sold at 85 taels. However, there were very few transactions at this price, especially for contingent trades. Later, the exchange market turned flat, and bank buying was not quiet. Speculators and others came to buy, immediately increasing the price by ten taels, but there were fluctuations of one or two taels at times. When the first shilling opened, it was 96.5 taels. Then, because the listing was extended by 2/5, U.S. dollars by 50 cents, and Japanese yen by a small 2.5 cents, it retreated to 91 taels. Shortly after, various banks took in 143,125 August English pounds, settling at 2/5, and various firms dragged in successively, pulling the price up by more than eight taels. From 9:30 to 10:20, there were ups and downs of two taels, then to 99.5 taels. The English pounds only settled at 1.875 to 1.125. Retail investors sold, slightly causing a setback, with 10:30 at 95 taels.</p>
<p>Major Players Compete to Buy, Rapidly Turning to a High Point. After 11:00, there was a sign of rising. The buying momentum on the rigging surface was strong. Yan Yu, Zhi Feng Yong, Tian Xiang, Cui Chang Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Da Xing Yong, Jin An, Yuan Da, Fu Chang, and goods all competed to buy. It was also heard that the Indian exchange telegrams had slightly decreased by four Anbang. As a result, the market price jumped by more than ten taels, with 11:30 at 711 taels. The English pounds were particularly strong, only settling at four banches. It then returned by a small 2.5 taels, and immediately rebounded by three taels, totaling 11.5 taels. At half past noon, it was 09 taels, due to Yuan Mao Yong and others selling. Suddenly, it was heard that the English pounds were changed to a reduction of 2/5, U.S. dollars by 50 cents, and Japanese yen by a large 2.5 cents. People's hearts suddenly rose, continuing to make a large five or six taels, reaching 715 taels. The listed price was changed to 735 taels, totaling 40 taels to 43 taels. Then 24 or 25 taels. At noon, it was changed to 747 taels, then suppressed by 33 taels.</p>
<p>The Market in the Afternoon Lingered in Excellent Condition. The afternoon market opened at twelve taels, then at 15.5 taels due to buyer activity. Then it returned to twelve taels. Shunli and Wan Xing sold, and because the Indian exchange had slightly decreased by four Anbang, it reached 16.5 taels. Zhi Feng Yong and Wan Xing's intentions were not sluggish, and because the English pounds could settle at 875, 2:20 was at 11.5 taels. In an instant, it pulled up by more than four taels, with 2:30 at 16 taels. Yuan Heng and Yuan Mao Yong bought in. Later, Hua Yi issued 9375, and the market situation seemed slightly looser. Because the head cover came to buy, at 3:30 it was 11.5 taels again. Afterwards, it gradually rose, and the buying side became more vigorous. It is estimated that Yan Yu, Heng Yu, Zhi Feng Yong, and goods were coming in one after another. The banks mutually traded English pounds at 875. If they settled at 8125, people's hearts were stirred, and the price was pulled up by six or seven taels. At 4:20, it reached 18.5 taels, exceeding the previous market. Only Wan Xing and Shunli sold out, so it retreated by more than two taels. By 4:30, the market closed at 15.8 taels, an increase of 13.8 taels compared to the end of last week. It then traded at around fourteen taels. According to the end of the day, the maximum price was 718.5 taels, and the minimum price was 685 taels, a difference of thirty-three taels and a half. Goods opened at 87.5 in the afternoon and closed at 709.5 in the afternoon, with twelve taels and eight qian in the afternoon. The listed price was estimated to be 31 taels to 35 taels, and later</p>

Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Yuan Cheng, Tong Tai Chang, Wan Xing, and Shunli all exited. Fu Chang entered and then exited. Fu Tai Heng, Yuan Chun, and Tai Feng Cheng exited. The afternoon Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Yuan Tai, Cui Chang Yong, Yuan Heng, and Yan Yu all entered. Da De Cheng, Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Tai Heng, Sen Chang Yong, Yi Chang, and Hui Xiang had many ins and outs. Tong Xin Chang, Shunli, and Wan Xing all exited. Mr. Wu chased after them. The Dalian gang had a total of four or five thousand bars, with supply exceeding demand. The Guangdong gang watched from the sidelines.</p>

Chinese merchants traded a lot, with a total of about 300,000 to 400,000 English pounds transacted. In total, there were more sales than purchases. Occasionally, gold was used for hedging, with the largest head cover leaving by twenty-four or five taels, and the smallest by fourteen or five taels, which was very complicated. Those who bundled together should follow the reduction of three taels. There were not many U.S. dollar ins and outs.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Remarkably Prosperous, Silver Settlement Particularly Frequent</h3>

<h3>Fluctuations in the Yarn and Flower Market</h3>
<p>Tomorrow, the yarn exchange will be closed for the tenth-anniversary celebration for one day.</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the afternoon after a morning drop, but the trend remained weak, likely due to poor conditions in the four gardens. Most were psychologically bearish, and the market sentiment was very weak. Current yarn business is unusually</p>
<p>quiet. There are no purchasing news from any groups, and sellers are particularly aggressive. As for the gold price, it is unstable. There is a severe lack of those betting on a rise. The overall situation is sluggish, and there is currently a sense of desolation without any signs of recovery. However, based on practical observations, there are no major flaws. There may be a large fluctuation in the short term. Distant futures broke the 60 tael mark. Before the exchange traders placed their bids, the market opened with a significant drop in the gold price, and the market atmosphere was quite flat. The market gradually declined, with each month falling by 1.257 taels. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere tightened, rebounding by 1.8 to 9 taels, because the gold price exceeded 710 taels. As a result, people's confidence was boosted, and in the end, each month still fell by 678 taels. The total turnover was 29,050 bales. After investigation, Da Feng had 1,050 bales, and the actual shipment was 3,200 bales. Changyi had 1,300 bales, Xinqian had 800 bales, but it benefited 700 bales. Shenxin had 650 bales, Tianlong had 950 bales, Shenji had 1,300 bales, Yichang had 900 bales, and Yiyu had 850 bales. Here are the recorded closing prices of the bidding:</p>

<p>September 1598 6 75,600</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn remain as sluggish as before, with spot sales remaining flat. It has been investigated that</p>
<p>the actual purchases from various groups throughout the day totaled 600 bales, with 500 bales being traded among dealers. The market is flat and weak. Customers from the southern groups brought in 135 bales from inland areas, 40 bales from Haizhou, 40 bales from Yunnan, 80 bales from the northern groups, 40 bales from Guangdong, and 100 bales from miscellaneous groups.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Dominated by Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas cotton market was flat. The situation in the local market was particularly volatile. It only turned firm in the afternoon, as the entire market was solely focused on gold prices. Japanese merchants resumed buying near-month contracts, and the market atmosphere suddenly tightened. However, spot cotton business remained sluggish. Demand from various factories was quiet, and market sentiment was relatively flat. As for future situations, one dares not predict.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard futures fell in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon. The exchange's Hankou Standard futures opened in the morning with the gold price falling below the 690 tael mark, while foreign cloth remained flat, leading to a softening of market sentiment, with each month falling by 2.3 fen. In the afternoon, the gold price rose to above 700 taels, and Japanese merchants also entered the market, with each month rebounding by 3.4 fen. The total turnover was 50,100 dan. It was found that Taixing sold 1,000 dan, Hengde 1,000 dan, and Yicheng 1,000 dan, Guangfeng 1,700 dan. Changfeng bought 6,200 dan, Xiesheng 2,100 dan, Guangfeng 1,300 dan, and Meiji 1,100 dan.

<h3>Grain: Cloudy Weather Stabilizes the Rice Market</h3>
<p>News: Yesterday's rice market saw a slight increase in arrivals, about ten or so boats. Due to unfavorable weather, the number of people coming to the market in the morning was not very enthusiastic. Thick japonica rice remained stable, especially top-grade goods. Middle-grade goods dealers gradually became active, with both buyers and sellers disposing of their holdings as the market dictated. The use of "斛脚" (a type of rice measure) increased, slightly weakening the overall situation. Demand for thin indica rice was still high, with prices rising slightly. The supply of Dufu pointed rice sometimes stopped, lacking a clear pattern. Green rice stores were nearly empty, and buyers were no longer paying much attention, only inquiring about the price. Glutinous rice used in wine workshops and tea shops showed a slight increase in interest, stabilizing the market.</p>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, the supply from various groups became increasingly scarce. There were some old goods in Pudong, but sales in urban and rural shops remained thin. Due to the cloudy weather, interest in fresh rice slightly increased, and market activity also showed a slight opening. Also, due to continuous price declines in recent days, dealers were unwilling to lower prices further, stabilizing the thick japonica rice market. The market showed firmness for top-grade rice, and stability for middle grades. Although the arrival of thin indica rice was not large, the Ningbo interest and the local street sales market remained sluggish. It was not easy for sellers to dispose of their holdings, so prices fell again by five fen. Yang Dufu pointed rice continued to weaken in recent days. Only a small amount of top-grade rice was selected. The middle-grade rice market continued to show signs of weakness. Sales of "阴化" rice (a type of rice) only focused on high-quality fresh rice. The top-grade "中次" (middle grade) rice was stable, while old rice was weak.</p>
<h3>Diverging Trends in the Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, it initially showed a flat trend, followed by signs of firmness. Foreign wheat quotations fluctuated by one or two jiao. Although gold prices initially fell, they subsequently rebounded, thus stabilizing public sentiment. Futures for all months, particularly from August onward, rose steadily due to frequent absorption by Tianjin-Yingkou groups. July was particularly favorable due to the halt in selling by factories, naturally boosting outside interest. However, by the afternoon opening, the trends between near and distant months underwent a major shift. As this month was the last day, "浮多" (speculators) were eager to settle their positions, causing the price to gradually decline from 2.025 taels, reaching a low of 2 taels. After the fifth board, prices rebounded slightly. Due to the nature of this month, July futures also softened. However, it was reported that a certain factory had made purchases, resulting in a stagnant situation. Perhaps this kind of action will lead to a bullish trend and further selling plans, which remains to be seen. As for the "兵船现粉" (powdered flour on a military ship), it was said that real buyers were purchasing according to standards, with ordinary flour being priced one fen higher. As a result, this month's prices fell by 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, July remained unchanged, September was up by 7.5 li, October was up by 1 fen, and November was up by 1.25 li.</p>
<h3>Not Optimistic About the Wheat Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures continued to decline gradually. Since the sharp fall in gold prices, foreign wheat prices have shown little sign of rising. It seems that overseas wheat markets have not yet escaped the period of oversupply. Moreover, after the arrival of new wheat, factory demand has been sluggish, and current wheat inventories in Shanghai have reached 30,000 to 40,000 bags. Given all these factors, bullish investors are naturally nervous. Furthermore, in the past few days of the previous week, approximately 100,000 tons of foreign wheat were transacted. Therefore, the unfavorable prospects for the wheat market are unavoidable due to the prevailing conditions. During both the morning and afternoon sessions, prices gradually fell as bullish investors engaged in reverse selling. Fortunately, the Shaoxing group provided support in the afternoon, slightly stabilizing the market. As a result, July and August futures fell by six fen compared to the previous week, September fell by four fen, October fell by three fen, and November fell by four fen. In the spot wheat market, Shanghai factories have not yet shown demand and are taking a wait-and-see approach. It is rare to see such a scenario during the peak season for new wheat. Throughout the city, only the Ningbo group purchased 400 bags of Nanjing wheat at 3.36 taels.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factories Lack Goods and Transactions Are Difficult</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market tended to be quiet and firm. Although there were continued telegrams from Lyon white factory "经货" (high-quality silk) to Shanghai, factories lacked sufficient hand goods and transactions were difficult. Yesterday, Shenchang and others purchased 30 packages of upper and middle-grade silk factory "经货," and Samsung purchased 5 packages of yellow silk. Prices were firm and stable.</p>
<h3>Decreasing Prices in Wuyuan Young Tea Market</h3>
<p>After the new Wuyuan young tea came out, the brokers eagerly purchased it, raising the market price to 7 jiao per jin. Some tea firms even offered 80 yuan for the purchase. This was because the quality of this year's young tea was very good, with tender and fragrant characteristics, and there were many fine goods available. Therefore, the firms were happy to purchase it despite the high price. However, yesterday, a telegram from Shanghai reported that the price of Tunxi Zhenmei tea had fallen by 50 to 60 taels, causing a decrease in the interest of tea firms. The purchase price of young tea today has fallen by 50 yuan per dan, down 20 yuan from the previous two days, and there is still a downward trend.</p>
<h3>New Information on Tunxi Tea Market</h3>
<p>Since Tunxi tea firms shipped the new "头字" Zhenmei tea to Shanghai and earned over 300 taels, general tea brokers have greatly increased their purchases, raising the market price by over 80 yuan. Brokers from Wudong and Xiuzhuan "四响" (well-known tea producing area) transported their inventories to Tunxi for sale, taking advantage of the high prices in Tunxi. Recently, the market prices announced by various tea firms still range from 70 to 84 or 85 yuan. The original new and old tea firms have all opened their operations as usual, with no increase or decrease compared to last year. The selling price of banknotes has shown a decline, as there is less demand for silver dollars in the tea market. The cost of transporting silver has surged, with the price of 1,000 taels rising from 1,340 yuan to over 1,370 yuan. Sales of tea dust in shops and tea estates have recently been very brisk, with the price per dan rising from 12 yuan to 28 yuan or 30 yuan, the highest record ever. General tea brokers have all switched to purchasing tea dust, and the briskness of sales is rare.</p>
<h3>Pitou Yuanzhi Tribute Cloth Prices Increasingly Expensive</h3>
<p>The market price of Yuan Qing Tribute Cloth has increased significantly in recent days, as the price of wool overseas has soared, making the fixed price very expensive. Compared to the current spot price, it is a reverse situation. Those holding goods are raising prices, disregarding the insufficient cost. According to the investigation, the inventory of Yuan Qing Tribute Cloth in local and foreign warehouses in Shanghai is very small, especially the five- or six-tael cloths, which are particularly scarce. Yesterday, Rongtai's 15330 Lide Picture was sold for 7.55 taels per yard, Ningfeng's 288 Diamond was 7 taels, Anlijv's Bon was 7 taels net, Tianxiang's 888 was 6.75 taels, De's 2488 Four Virtues was 5 taels, and 1440 Huang Tianba was 5.75 taels.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Reopens Vigorously</h3>
<p>Taigu Sugar Also Opens Over 10,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was still a lack of news from the sugar production areas. The association's market price for the 24th grade of coarse white sugar in the Dutch market remained low, and the price remained at 11.2 taels. The 20th grade of medium white sugar was 10.065 taels, and the 8th grade was also 9.25 taels. The market situation was stable, and there was a considerable amount of Japanese sugar trading, and the market also rose slightly. "N" mark was 10.0825 to 85 taels, "SH" mark was 10.06 to 25 taels, "T" mark was 11.2 taels, TM mark was 10.07 taels, TK mark was 10.085 taels, YR mark was 10.05 June 25 to 75, and the trend was quite good. Taigu Sugar sold more than 10,000 bags for delivery in July. The price of DY mark was 4.5 Japanese yen, CW mark was 4.6 yen, B mark was 4.7 yen, HX mark was 4.4 yen, HM mark was 4.2 yen. Meiji Sugar continued to open 10,000 bags in September, and the price of YT mark was 4.5 yuan. The Central Factory opened ARAE at 4.6 yuan for delivery in August and September, and then continued to open 3,000 bags in September at the original price. Dali Sugar also opened 15,000 bags, with the "N" mark price at 4.6 yuan and the "T" mark price at 4.8 yuan. The market was relatively flat. Dutch sugar was sold by the new factory for shipment in August, with the 8th grade of Dutch red sugar at 5.1 Dutch guilders per 100 tons and the 10th grade at 5.27 Dutch guilders. Demand was very quiet. Nanshenglong sold dozens of tons of 8th grade Dutch sugar for delivery in July, priced at 5.075 Dutch guilders, all new regulations plus tax, and the market situation was relatively good.</p>
<h3>Scarce Arrival of Longkou Vermicelli in North-South Goods Market Leads to Price Increase</h3>
<p>Although over a thousand pieces of Longkou vermicelli arrived a few days ago, most of them were transferred to other places. The number of goods self-managed by local businesses and the number of customer goods was only about 500 pieces. The customer market was very tight, and it was heard that the price was 23 taels, about two taels higher than before, so the market price also followed closely.</p>
<h3>New Shipment of French West Nails Arrives in Hardware Market</h3>
<p>As reported earlier in this newspaper, the local inventory of French West nails is very low, but there are many buyers, resulting in most of those seeking delivery being unable to purchase. A significant amount of new goods arrived in the past two days, with Gonghexing, Mitsubishi, and other warehouses each receiving two to three thousand barrels. Therefore, buyers, hearing this news, are all making purchases separately. It is heard that over 1,300 barrels have already been sold. The market price is 9.5 taels per barrel. It has been found that most of the buyers are from the Yangtze River region.</p>
<h3>Sales of British Steel Plate Driven by Qingyan Region in Hardware Market</h3>
<p>Due to the sluggish spot sales in the hardware trade, the market remains lackluster. However, the trend of British steel plates, which have been in the doldrums for a long time, was driven yesterday by the purchase of Qingyan groups, causing the market to be very lively. Prices were rising successively, with increases of two to three qian. For example, 2.5 li is estimated at 8.75 taels per dan, 0.5 fen is 7 taels, 7.5 li is 6.75 taels, 1 fen is 6.25 taels, and prices above 1.5 fen are uniformly sold at 6 taels. According to the investigation, the groups from Qingdao and Yantai purchased a total of 800 to 900 dan yesterday. In addition, groups from the Yangtze River and Tianjin also made some purchases, so the future trend is very promising.</p>

<p>The Mei Yi Appreciation Society states: Our society recently released new products, including Santa Claus, Cupid, Little Laborer, Seashore Poem, Newly Bathed Large Nude, and new reclining, standing, and sitting styles, as well as the original ones, totaling more than 200 styles. They are all works by famous artists, displayed and sold at the New World National Goods Bazaar, and distributed at Sincere, Wing On, and Xihu Silk Weaving Landscape Factory on North Sichuan Road and other large department stores. Beautifully decorated, they can be called new and unique gifts.</p>
<p>Qingyun Pavilion Commercial Hall on 4th Ma Road declares: In order to increase entertainment for guests, our commercial hall has opened a "Little Guanghan Palace" on the third floor starting from July 1st, gathering famous Shanghai courtesans to sing Beijing-style tunes and popular songs. The time is from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM and from 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM every day. The tea fee will not be increased.</p>
<p>Kefa Pharmacy on Nanjing Road declares: Our pharmacy has been open for a long time and is very large in scale. The medicines produced are particularly effective. Among them is a kind of "asthma cigarette," which is shaped like an ordinary paper cigarette. It can relieve asthma, reduce phlegm, and regulate qi. The effect is very fast. If elderly people are overworked and experience asthma, they can put one in their mouth and immediately feel comfortable. It is indeed worthy of being an "asthma savior."</p>
<p>Daxin Silk and Satin Shop at the corner of 3rd Ma Road and Shimen Road declares: Our shop previously imported a large batch of modern clothing materials. Later, people from all walks of life, socialites, daughters of noble families, and young students went to purchase them one after another. All the goods with novel patterns and low prices, such as woven flower georgette, woven flower voile, woven flower silk, poplin, and Indian silk, were quickly sold out and became popular in the market. There was a risk of some goods running out. Fortunately, the staff of the shop were quick and thorough in their work, and they telegraphed famous domestic factories in advance to expedite the shipping and weaving of various items. Now, the shop has received more than 100 boxes of new summer clothing materials in the past two days, which is just enough to meet the demand. In order to consistently adhere to the business policy of "profiting from volume," the shop will continue to sell all items at low prices. This is truly good news for ladies from all walks of life who want to make new summer clothes.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Baixing Grand Theater at the intersection of Laobazi Road and Fusheng Road declares that it will be screening the only silent adventurous romance, the latest masterpiece, starting today.</p>
<p>The New Central Theater declares: Movie star Zhang Zhiyun is famous at home and abroad for her two films, "Empty Valley Orchid" and "Plum Blossom Falling." In other words, these two films are Zhang Zhiyun's launching works. Since Zhang left the screen, these two films have become more famous, especially "Plum Blossom Falling," which is the most popular. Moreover, this film has not been re-screened in theaters north of Shanghai for a long time. In order to give preferential treatment to the audience, this theater has specially requested the Mingxing Company to rent and screen it for three days, and has lowered the ticket price for evening shows by 10 cents, the same as the daytime show price. The theater is also fully equipped with electric fans, so even in the hot summer, you will not feel the heat.</p>
<h3>Medical News</h3>
<p>Bao Ru Hospital declares: German female doctor Jiang Bao Ru has many years of clinical experience and has served as a doctor in major hospitals in this city and other cities. Now she has established this hospital at No. 108 Xizilaihuo Street, the intersection of French Concession Ma Road. It is divided into internal medicine, obstetrics, gynecology, pediatrics, dermatology, venereology, and various injections for leucorrhea and spermatorrhea. The fees are very low. The grand opening will be held today, with free consultations for three days, with only a 20-cent registration fee. Free consultations will also be provided every afternoon to benefit the poor and sick.</p>
<p>Shifang Hospital on Er Ma Road declares: This hospital was founded by the famous doctor Tu Qihua. For more than ten years, it has enjoyed a remarkable reputation and treats various internal and external departments. It is especially well-known for venereology. Recently, Mr. Sun, a member of the banking industry, suffered from gout, with alternating chills and fever, and was unable to move an inch. After several diagnoses and treatments, none were effective. Later, introduced by a friend, Dr. Tu personally examined him and diagnosed it as gonorrheal arthritis. Using the latest scientific methods of acupuncture and medicine, he was completely cured in less than a week.</p>
<p>The office of traditional Chinese medicine doctor Xu Bingxiong declares: This doctor is a third-generation family doctor. He has a clinic in a residential house on Dou Market Street (Xu Lu), specializing in various internal medicine diseases, especially skilled in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. With more than 50 years of research experience, he carefully studies medical theories. Every consultation is effective. If you ask for treatment, he is humble and willing to discuss in detail, without the habits of famous doctors, and does not limit the time. Even if you go in the morning and leave in the evening (if he is not out on a house call), he is always available for consultation. Therefore, people from all walks of life trust and seek treatment from him, regardless of medical fees or poverty. In addition to providing medical treatment, he also gives away medicine from the Lao Lai Yi Pharmacy to benefit poor and suffering people. There are many disciples serving him, and Chen Chuyuan and others are the most prominent, with a thorough understanding of medical theories. Currently, due to other business relationships, they are still secretly reluctant to come forward.</p>
