<p>（一）裁撤釐金及與釐金類似之苛捐雜税實爲掃除半世紀以上重大弊政之設施爲三十年來人民迫切要求而歷來政府虚聲號召終歸不忍裁撤者今一旦掃盡其於國貨國產將來發展流通上之影響可知但此事之澈底完成尙須賴政府與國民之共同監察所惜裁厘之利適爲銀價慘落之損失掩去一部份不知如厘金不裁而銀價慘落國民在經濟上更無法忍受也</p>
<p>（二）關税自主爲中國經濟生存之所關國貨之不振興工商業之無法保護胥由於關税自主權之喪失歷年國人抗爭他國一意以延宕爲能事乃於今年由國民政府收回自主權此事對於國民生計關鍵之大惟將來之事實可以證之他如收回法權問題多數國家均已承認惟有三國尙在觀望但不久必可達到政府完全之目的江西湖南勦共軍事有顯著的進展其主力即將擊破導淮築路工程順序進行中央銀行之信用日增資產加至二萬萬元國弊凡此諸端政府决不敢引以爲滿足特别關於外交方面非努力進行達到完全取消不平等條約不止然此等昭蘇景况未始非七個月來統一和平大局之所賜此我同胞對於統一和平價値之應有認識也</p>

<p>欲充分了解統一和平之可貴及其對於將來民族生存問題之影響應更進一步分析國際的與國内的實際環境知他人之虚實爲本身之檢點乃謀國所必要者請先察國際的趨勢而尤重其經濟發展之方面</p>
<p>（一）目前國際問普遍之危機厥爲經濟恐慌失業人數有增無已生產過剩爲一般人所抱之隠憂大戰後歐美日本各國生產量之增加自係顯著之事實但云生產至於過剩則各國工人農民又何曾皆能享受相當標準以上之生活專門理由自多聚訟要其主要癥結所在仍係分配之不平均苟此種制度不變則歐美日本各國之貨物寗視其國内一部份人缺乏享受然爲經濟利益計必須移之於他國此種分配制度一時旣難變更則帝國主義之經濟侵略亦决難中止此產業落後而經濟抵抗力薄弱如中國者之所以可慮也</p>
<p>（二）以上就資本主義之國家而言即就以共產主義號召之蘇俄論當其五年計畫完成以後亦係世界商塲上競爭之新勢力以一萬三千餘萬人口之總動員運用八萬兆盧布之資本將全俄農塲工廠作集產的科學生產化其規模自有可觀設其成功生產力亦自未易侮今蘇俄更縮短五年期爲四提期以求從速完成即就其在中央亞細亞所經營之產棉事業而論其突飛猛進之數量勢將以中國爲尾閭况其一四四五公里環繞新疆邊境以聯接西伯利亞幹綫之新路已於去年竣工與深入我國東北之中東鐵路左提右絜勢成常山之蛇疆域啣錯綿亘萬里無論軍事經濟宣傅各方面國人皆應嚴重注意者也</p>
<p>至歐美日本各國政治軍事之大勢自不必一一列舉至少近五年内歐美國際間之政治軍事問題尙在經濟支配問題之下如縮减軍備之能否成功尤其海軍分配問題之能否圓滿解决以及法國之邊防意國之海外發展皆關係國際和平之大勢世界武裝和平之局面已成無可諱言之事實我國家本其酷愛和平之心理極力希望世界和平但萬一不幸國際間有戰爭暴發我國至低限度亦當有充分自衛的準備且進而謀國際地位之進展處於今日之世界我同胞對於國際環境尤當不斷注意以謀深刻之認識而圖國家之適應</p>
<p>回顧國内的實際環境不能不令人慙憤悲傷者但疾者不能諱醫科學研究當先以事實爲對象中國積貧積弱百孔千瘡尤以失業與生產落後爲最大病根如人民敎育之不普及政治經騐之缺乏與自治習慣之從未養成亦爲民族進展途中之重要障碍目前中國社會演化尙在歐洲工業革命之初期而他人進展已超過一世紀以上替代中國手工工業者最大部分非國内之機器工業而係他國之機器工業與中國勞力相爭持者最大部分非中國之資本而係他國之資本本國</p>

<p>— 呆</p>
<p>一九三一式各種新車已先後問世觀乎各廠對於新車之製造改進之處不堪計數而下列各點尤爲特著之點茲略述其梗概以告本刋讀者</p>
<p>售價低廉　一九三一式新車各廠已陳列於市上觀其優點其中最足驚人之處殆爲售價之低廉社會方面目前出價美金一·○○○元或竟不免此數已可購得優良之汽車一輛此豈我人事前所能意料者耶就過去之汽車史上觀察而得則昔日之新車開世之初售價最高者同樣之汽車今日之售價已不滿千元而八缸汽車更充斥於市上其力量之濃厚又爲歷來所未見而新車之上不拘内外各部外觀方面莫不有驚人之處他如條紋之明顯外部之光滑駕駛人坐位之清潔無一而非引人贊美之處實堪謂價廉物美之車輛也</p>
<p>顔色美觀　車身之上所添顔色亦較前大爲進步且各部之色彩均能調和一致所謂調和者不僅外觀即内部亦然雖零星之附件亦覺顔色善觀彼此相映絶無厭人之處此種成績設非廠方工人悉心研究實不足至此他如構造方法可簡則簡可省則省尤足使車主得以低價購車一言以蔽之一九三一式各廠新車進步之處確然不少而且中又皆爲令人驚異者可見汽車之進步大有一日千里之概也</p>
<p>汽車加多　以過去一年之中各廠所產汽車而言則顯然有一種新的趨向即汽缸加多是也回憶一九二九年全年所產汽車六缸車輛佔百分之六十而一九三零年則八缸佔百分之六十彼此相形則適成一反比例可見近來汽車之製造有多汽缸之趨向汽缸一多汽車本身之力量自會增加他如活塞之改進燃燒室地位之增廣皆足增加汽車之力量者也</p>
<p>傳動系統　以一九三一式之新車而言如加以分析則底盤用四次分速者有二十種三次分速者六十三種各齒輪完全用活輪者一種活輪僅用於最高或第二分速者十種而傳動系統一九三一式改進之點尤足令人加以注意予以討論且營業上更有極大之關係此外汽缸之竭力加多竟有十六汽缸之汽車問世而成績又非常優美在汽車史上實爲一重大紀念而由柄棍之改良亦爲足以增進汽車之力量者也</p>
<p>其他種種　各廠新車改進之點旣如上述然此外尚有多多而其最足令人滿意即遮蔽日光之風鏡此種風鏡目前雖低價汽車亦有裝置薄片玻璃製成風鏡已成普遍之事社會方面不久將需要此種汽車也計速器之改進使駕車之人行駛途中目力所及即知速度若干不若往日之計速器須加詳細之觀察且頗爲準確尚有種種優點篇幅所限不能盡述於此祗得從略</p>

<p>道奇亦爲美國著名汽車廠之一近來事業亦頗發達自創設以來屈指已十六年於茲矣在此十六年中廠方當局慘澹經營卒能以出品之優良經營之得法獲有相當之信譽最近曾舉行十六周紀念頗爲熱閙茲將十六年來道奇之發展情形略述於後以資紀念想亦爲讀者所樂聞也</p>
<p>第一輛汽車　一九三○年十一月十四日美國道奇車廠曾舉行十六周紀念大會蓋道奇車廠自成立以來已有十六年之攸久回憶十六年前時爲一九一五年道奇車輛開始陳列於汽車展覽大會之中與社會相見在過去十六年中道奇之發展情形言之亦頗神秘道奇之在今日是否已得有相當之基礎與信用雖無充分之證明然有一事足爲讀者告者即道奇廠所產第一號汽車迄今雖有十六年之隔目前仍行駛於街頭之上我人至騰納斯省納許威爾地方即可看見如以此車所行之路程作一總計則十六年中已有三五○○○○哩道奇廠之代理商人昔日曾經售此車者今日亦仍爲道奇廠之經售者而十六年中此人經售之車輛爲數之多亦已不堪計數矣</p>
<p>信譽之由來　道奇之信譽得以有穩固之基礎者唯一原因乃在廠方製車之時務使出品有相當之價值而又能極力使購車之人節省算用欲達此目的主要之點即在計劃良好原料優美製車之人均有高超之手術蓋非此不足以有價廉物美之車輛也試觀道奇第一輛汽車所行路程已可絶地球六次而車輛之本身並未有重大之損壞何可行駛途中已足見其成續之優良此種服務精神十六年如一日迄今仍並未少變製車之時原料必選上乘之品而車輛製成以後售價又務使十分低廉至於道奇車輛今日仍得社會之信用者乃在逐年新車有所改進外觀内容均能使顧客滿意耳在此十六年中道奇車之引擎逐年改革已進步不少確爲優良之汽車回憶當年第一輛汽車問世之初至於今日有如此驚人成績又豈夢想所及耶較之昔日不特物質優良且馬力較多行駛較速而安全問題又復增進不少</p>
<p>銷車之總數　在此十六年中道奇廠之車輛銷數已達二百五十萬輛車主所付之車價達美金四○○○○○○○○○以上在美國各廠之中銷數有如此之多信用有若是穩固亦堪稱絶無而僅有矣至於足使車主能盡人滿意尤爲雖能之事如以今日之車輛與創立之初所產第一輛汽車作一比較則改進之點尤覺不堪勝計逐年之新車均有改進之處不少故迄於今日道奇車輛已堪稱盡善盡美矣他姑勿論即如車式之美觀長度之得宜力量之濃厚駕駛之穩便已足令人贊歎且廠方製車之目標近來仍力求價廉物美精益求精故他日之新車將較今日爲更佳也無疑矣</p>

<p>三十年前與現在的比較</p>
<p>佛及爾賓克萊氏說三十年以前大不列顚境内所有的私人用汽車商業運貨車和出租的公共汽車一切統計在内還不到三千輛在那個時候合計全國所有的製造汽車工人他的人數祇有兩千左右到了現在情形就大不相同了單就製造汽車的工人而論各個汽車工廠裏所需要的工人總數至少在五十萬上下所以有許多人說依照目下商業衰落和失業人數一天高似一天的當兒倘使用汽車事業來救濟這件缺憾的事倒也很有希望的哩</p>
<p>二十世紀開場的時候汽車的速率和他的耐用能力究經怎樣現在已經没有人知道了金箭汽車是一件神奇的東西十二隻汽缸和十六隻的汽車還没有將樣子劃出那時候的汽車事業正在幼稚園的時代哩法蘭西在這時候僅僅有二千八百九十七輛汽車其中五百四十三輛爲實業試騐而造的法國汽車事業直到一八九六年之後進步纔非常之快有許多試騐費在用不少的金錢一八九五年法蘭西人從巴黎駕車到鮑達克司再從鮑達克司回到巴黎創始了一個七百四十四英里的汽車比賽紀錄那一輛獲得錦標的汽車旣復有頭上活塞成者大炭化器外表非常的醜陋在粗劣不平的馬路上平均每小時駛行十五英里</p>
<p>德國人對汽車製造業非常的注意新世紀中德國工程師費盡心力想用汽車作爲連輸的媒介以求交通上的革命七年中間效騐非常的好單就一千九百零七年講這一年中造了二七·○二六輛汽車一千九百年時候美國的汽車祇有六百輛價值美金一·二九○·○○○元那時候亨利福特祇不過是一個青年機師夢想着要造他自已的汽車果然他成了世界上最大的汽車製造家達屈立屋是一個富庶的河流城市等待汽車事業高潮的到來巡迴裁判官騎着馬來往在後有開闢的事方火車機頭握着速率最高的紀錄</p>
<p>三十年前大不列顚開始製造汽車英國汽車製造家在法蘭西人費了大量金錢這個早而不穩定的開始裏大家都想握着汽車製造業首領的資格這樣一來大家不免有所競爭跟着還有金屬材料·油·橡皮·鋼鐵·等等原料的競爭這是汽車發明後的第一幕景像至今還没有停止</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>自從一千九百年以來各國使用他的資本和能力以求得國外市塲的銷售關於保護國内市塲的法律也同時通過化了整千累萬的金錢去得到速率和耐久的紀錄汽車旅行和輪船火車互相競爭開闢了許多新地方這多是近三十年中的事早年間英國的實業還在飄搖不定的時候常有法律束縛汽車事業的發達譬如一八九六年至一九零四年之間載重過三噸的汽車不准在馬路上跑運貨車更在禁止之例一千九百年時大不列顚及愛爾蘭汽車俱樂部就是現在的皇家汽車俱樂部發起了一個英國汽車旅行行程一千英里以便引起汽車旅行的樂趣這個汽車旅行隊裏的汽車光顧了各個城市蘇格蘭也包括在内當那汽車到了一個城鎭受着熱烈的歡迎地窟裏的礦工都抛棄了他們的鐵剷到地面上來看這個用汽油燃燒的新奇機器駕駛的人似乎毫不費力的樣子所以民衆的慶祝到處可見銀行和商店大多休業無論那個地方無論那個人對於這個二十世紀的機器新發明都非常的發生趣味</p>
<p>這次的游行在公衆中間證明了汽車是運輸代步的實用品到了一九零五年大不列顚的汽車僕增加了七倍之多一千九百零七年時汽車工廠中每個月製造汽車及商用運貨車一千輛一九一零年時常年汽車出產有一四·○○○輛之多十年之後英倫·蘇格蘭及愛爾蘭共有汽車製造家八十家不過其中愛爾蘭祇有一個汽車製造廠在白爾發司脫地方各工廠裏所僱用的工人共達四萬人這個八十家汽車製造家成立於二十年前的某中三十家仍舊用着老名字其餘有的停止營業有的與别個汽車廠併合起來或者調了新的牌號</p>

<h3 id="e1">Grand Opening of the National Assembly <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>More than 450 Representatives in Attendance</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Sincere Opening Address</p>
<p>Today's Veneration at the Mausoleum and Inaugural Preparatory Meeting</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee, following the late Premier's will and a resolution from the Fourth Plenary Session, convened the National Assembly. Its purpose is to gather the will and capacity of the nation to build a Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People. Preparations have been underway for months, and as of yesterday, all matters were ready. Over 451 representatives from various provinces have arrived in Nanjing. The National Assembly, entrusted with a significant mission, commenced its opening ceremony today (the 5th) at 9:00 AM in the newly built assembly hall. Before 8:00 AM, representatives began to enter the hall successively. Chairman Chiang and Deputy Commander Zhang also arrived before 8:30 AM. At exactly 9:00 AM, the bell rang to begin the meeting. Many foreign envoys and counselors were also invited to attend as observers. In total, over a thousand people were present, a grand gathering, indeed an unprecedented event since the founding of the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Grand Opening Ceremony <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM, the opening of the meeting was announced, and the sound of saluting cannons reverberated, filling the hall with a solemn atmosphere. At 9:10 AM, music was played, and everyone stood to sing the Party anthem in unison. After the anthem, they paid the highest respect to the national flag, the Party flag, and the late Premier's portrait. Chairman Chiang of the National Government stood at the center of the altar and read aloud the late Premier's will. After a three-minute silence, he ascended the platform to deliver the opening address, followed by a speech by Hu Shuhua, a representative from Shanghai. Afterward, everyone shouted slogans, and the music played to conclude the ceremony. At 11:00 AM, photos were taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Chairman Chiang's Speech <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The Party's Expectations for the Nation</p>
<p>Guaranteeing Peace and Unity</p>
<p>Exerting Efforts in Construction</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang delivered the opening address, stating: "As we enter a period of national unity and the beginning of political construction, we are honored to attend the grand National Assembly. We gather the nation's talents, pool the public will, cooperate wholeheartedly, and jointly determine a long-term plan for national stability and security, as well as a long-term strategy for national progress and survival. I, Zhongzheng, am filled with joy and, on behalf of the National Government of the Republic of China, extend my solemn respect to the National Assembly. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the late Premier of the Kuomintang, founded the Republic and died for the revolution, establishing the Three Principles of the People as the sole principle for national salvation and the National Revolution as the means to achieve it. The National Revolution Movement is also the Chinese national revival movement. Its responsibility is not only to eliminate warlords and imperialist obstacles but also to establish a foundation for national self-existence and self-reliance. National freedom and equality cannot be obtained by a weak, decadent, disorganized, and indolent nation. We must revitalize our strength, develop self-confidence, gather our wisdom and courage, persevere with determination, choose what is good and hold fast to it, and overcome all obstacles. This is the greatness of the late Premier's personality and a model for national revival. In the past, when the National Revolutionary Army launched the Northern Expedition, our Party comrades, with their initial self-confidence, believed that they would be able to eliminate the warlords and pacify the Central Plains. Although they experienced hardships, they eventually succeeded. Today, our Party is willing to take another step forward with compatriots across the country to establish a more confident construction effort. We deeply believe that the Chinese nation has the ability to build, and the government and the people have the sincerity to build. If we cooperate wholeheartedly and exert all our efforts in the construction undertaking, there is nothing that cannot be achieved. The national status will naturally be equal, and no one in the world can be self-reliant without being respected."</p>

<p>"Otherwise, even if we can show off our strength for a time, it will ultimately be outwardly strong but inwardly weak and cannot last. This is why all our compatriots should shift their minds and focus on a new page in history. The late Premier advocated revolution for more than forty years. His efforts in the creation and preservation of the Republic were tireless, and the blood of our martyrs was shed everywhere. His great achievements are recorded in history. Recalling the past moves us to solemnity. I still remember that the late Premier, for the sake of national peace and unity, went north despite his illness. Even in his final moments, he advocated 'peaceful unification to save China' and included the prompt convening of the National Assembly in his will. The mission of the National Assembly is to save China through peaceful unification. The late Premier's painstaking efforts are known to all. At that time, the Beijing government violated the late Premier's wishes and refused to convene the Assembly. Our Party saw through the old tricks of the warlords and knew that China's peaceful unification could not be achieved by seeking comfort. Therefore, the National Government followed the late Premier's teachings and, with the Party's heavy responsibility, was established in Guangzhou on July 1, 1925. In April 1926, there was another circular telegram advocating the convening of the National Assembly, but it received no response. On June 6th, I, Zhongzheng, was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army. On July 9th, we swore to begin the Northern Expedition. Since then, our armed comrades have upheld the spirit of their belief in the Three Principles of the People. Even if we shed our blood in the wilderness and expose our bones to the brambles, we will not hesitate. This long-term struggle demonstrates to us the difficulty of unification. Roughly speaking, the period can be divided into the following stages: from the oath-taking in Guangzhou to the defeat of Wu Peifu in Wuhan and the elimination of Sun Chuanfang in the Southeast, respecting the late Premier's will, establishing the capital in Nanjing, and resolutely purging the communists to correct the people's understanding of the late Premier's principles and the Party's policies, and then continuing the Northern Expedition."</p>
<h3 id="e4">National Assembly Holds Opening Ceremony <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>"Stabilizing Xuzhou and Huaihai was the first stage. This stage was very short, and the Central Plains were not yet unified. Furthermore, I, Zhongzheng, in order to preserve the unity of the revolutionary forces to counter the Northern Warlords after the communists had been purged in Wuhan, was determined to resign. Unexpectedly, although there was a so-called Ning-Han cooperation, the Party's leadership was interrupted. During this stage, things came to a standstill. Only the Battle of Longtan was enough to demonstrate the National Revolutionary Army's spirit of accepting orders in the face of danger and to consolidate the belief in establishing the capital in Nanjing. This is what I, Zhongzheng, find most gratifying. This was the second stage. This stage was still far from the goal of unification. In January 1928, after I, Zhongzheng, was ordered to resume my post, I actively carried out military operations in the Northern Expedition. At the end of April, we wiped out Xu Yuanquan, and on May 1st, we recovered Jinan. However, on the 3rd, we were obstructed by the Japanese army, resulting in the great tragedy of Jinan, a deeply painful national humiliation. In June, we recovered Beiping and Tianjin, and the Northeast accepted the Three Principles of the People, unifying the country. This was the third stage. However, before long, turmoil arose. In 1929, the Gui clique rebelled first, followed by Zhang and Feng, causing chaos. After several campaigns, the rebellion was roughly quelled. Then, the rebellious Yan Xishan colluded with the rebellious Feng Yuxiang to assert themselves, acting deceitfully and demanding endlessly, gathering fugitives and plotting rebellion. Thus, there was the great rebellion of May 1930, which was also the final struggle of the warlord cliques. Relying on the officers and soldiers' dedication and the people's support, the Northeast was ordered to enter the customs to suppress the rebellion. After six months of fierce fighting, with a front line stretching thousands of miles, the Central Government and the rebel army faced each other with a total force of over one million. In the scorching heat, we quickly put down the great disaster, and the Enlarged Conference, which had been parasitic under the warlords' protection, also collapsed. The country was once again unified. The Central Government was able to strictly follow the will of the late Premier and convene the National Assembly to lay the foundation for lasting unity and peace. From the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army to the end of the campaign against Feng Guojun, the number of revolutionary soldiers who died has reached more than 300,000, and the number of wounded is more than double that. The loss of life and property suffered by the people directly and indirectly from the war is immeasurable. The waste of national wealth is even greater. The Central Government would never resort to military force unless absolutely necessary. If a poisonous snake bites the hand, a brave man will cut off his arm. If the safety of life is not threatened, who would be willing to endure the dismemberment of the body? Every time I think of the sacrifices of the soldiers and the suffering of the people during the war, my heart is torn apart. Who does not hate war? Who has no parents? All these unprecedented and significant sacrifices are the price of this unity and peace. This is what all our compatriots should deeply recognize, cherish, and do their best to protect after experiencing the pain."</p>
<p>"To achieve China's true peace and unity and reach the constitutional period, we must first go through the period of political tutelage. This is the unique political proposition of the late Premier and is also necessary for China's current environment. Now that unification has been achieved and political tutelage can begin in practice, the people of the country should have a correct understanding of the theory of political tutelage so as not to be misled by empty words or deceived by instigation. In the past, the late Premier, in the declaration of the First National Congress of our Party, analyzed in detail the fallacies of the constitutionalists, peace conference advocates, provincial autonomy advocates, and merchant government advocates. Indeed, once the sun rises, even the smallest torch is extinguished. Since then, other theories have emerged one after another. Examining the governments of various countries in the world today, although their forms are different, their theoretical stands can be roughly divided into three categories, excluding the traditional divine right of kings, which need not be discussed. First, the political theory of Fascism is based on the spirit of transcendentalism, relies on the theory of the national organism, uses industrial organizations as a means, and identifies the state as the supreme entity. The state can demand any sacrifice from the people for the continuation of the nation's life, not based on current welfare. The right to rule is coexistent with society and has no precedence. Those who control it are the most effective rulers in the evolutionary stage. Since the sovereignty of the state is sacred, its horizontal and vertical development is unhindered, regardless of its international impact. Whether it is in line with the principle of universal harmony does not require a wise person to know. Second, the political theory of Communism is based on historical materialism, deduces from determinism, and recognizes that the state and the right to rule are integrated with class. It believes that in the past, the bourgeoisie had it, but now the proletariat should also have it, in order to eliminate other classes. Only when other classes have been completely eliminated can they ascend to communist society together, and the state will also disappear from then on. Therefore, in a country ruled by one party, class struggle is even more cruel. The process of eliminating opponents, even Lenin would find it difficult to predict. But it is certain that this kind of cruel means is not suitable for China's backward industrial situation and China's inherent morality. China also has no need for this. It can be asserted. Third, the political theory of liberal democracy is based on the individual, with the theory of natural human rights attached. It holds that sovereignty belongs to the whole people and emphasizes individual freedom. British and American democracy is based on their long-term evolutionary history, and the people are accustomed to the exercise of civil rights. Although it is sometimes unavoidable that the effectiveness is slow, it can still proceed. If it is implemented in a country without this historical and social background, the chaotic situation in Italy before the Fascist Party came to power can serve as a lesson. The weaknesses of the party's political meetings have been fully exposed, giving the critics doubts. Freedom must coexist with responsibility, otherwise, is freedom meaningful? If everyone speaks freely in the court, who will be responsible? This is the most heartbreaking thing. In short, every country has its own objective environment, and there is no political system in the world that can be completely transplanted. This is why the late Premier had to integrate Chinese and foreign theories, study the domestic situation, and then determine the best prescription for treating the country. Sovereignty belongs to all the people is the ultimate goal personally set by the late Premier. The way to achieve democracy must go through the stage of political tutelage to save the imminent national crisis and lead a nation with no political experience. It is impossible without the exercise of a more effective ruling power. Moreover, since it is clearly defined as a transitional stage, it is different from Fascist theory. As for nationalism, it must be mentioned and proved together with democracy and people's livelihood, so there is no danger of international aggression. It can be seen that the goal is universal harmony. The late Premier created the Principle of People's Livelihood to seek the livelihood and survival of the entire nation, and there is absolutely no need for the means of class struggle. Some people in the country advocate the theory of liberal democracy of the early 19th century in England and the United States to show off. Their theory is not at all surprising, and its specific manifestation is nothing more than parliamentary politics. I do not know that the late Premier before 1924 was not only a person who tried hard to support the Parliament, but also repeatedly launched the Protection of the Constitution movement, wandering and gathering extraordinary Parliaments in Guangdong and Sichuan. It can be said that he worked hard. However, the experience of the first Parliament was nothing but painful and disappointing. Later, from the Anfu Parliament to the Cao Kun bribery election Parliament, none did not inspire people's contempt and disgust. As for the constitution, from the Temple of Heaven Constitution to the Cao Kun Constitution, what was it like? The people of the country should not forget these experiences. If it is said that this can lead to good governance, it is no different from using this to deceive oneself. What good will building a house on the road do in times of emergency? Moreover, the aggression of imperialism, the rebellion of warlords, and the military actions of the Communist Party with its international background cannot be prevented by hesitant minds and meaningless debates, even if those who advocate democracy and sing freedom each occupy a seat and allow them to discuss peace and offer advice, quoting Westerners, it is still nothing more than having doubts in their hearts and being unable to satisfy the public's wishes. If we do not fight this year and do not fight next year, we will allow the Communist Party and the warlords to grow in the Central Plains. Today, what the country demands is the exercise of effective ruling power to achieve the goal of relieving the people's suffering, and the great and glorious revolutionary group in China is the Chinese Kuomintang. The Party cannot avoid shortcomings, but since the Party is an open revolutionary group that has completed the unification of China and is shouldering the mission of construction, the people cannot alienate it or harbor discriminatory thoughts. The Kuomintang is the Chinese Kuomintang. Alienating the people is alienating oneself. If there is discrimination, there is no sincerity to cooperate in construction. Those who suffer first are the entire nation and then themselves. The Party is a party that embraces the Three Principles of the People to save the country, and everyone can join it. Political tutelage also relies on everyone's cooperation to be successful. The Party is determined to save the country, and the government has a strong will to strive to do good. Therefore, I, Zhongzheng, do not hesitate to speak frankly and hope that compatriots across the country will have a deep understanding and awareness of this point."</p>
<p>"If we want political success in the future, we must recognize the facts of the past, fully analyze its objective environment, and admit the failures and mistakes of past politics. This is what those engaged in politics should have."</p>
<h3 id="e5">Group Photo of All Committee Members After the Opening Ceremony <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>"Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Central Government has been established, but the country is still often trapped in a military period. The two Northern Expeditions, the second Western Expedition, the Zhang-Gui rebellion, followed by Tang and Feng, until 1930, although it was the first year of political tutelage, the military affairs of that year were more intense than in any previous year. The local areas were affected by military affairs, the government orders were affected by military affairs, and finance and transportation were all affected by military affairs. Reviewing the political situation in the past, there were many things that made people feel ashamed and indignant. Speaking of material construction, because of the military expenses, there were no funds, and because of the war, it was impossible to absorb foreign investment. Although many things were done, few achieved results. For example, in the construction of highways, the country only had 2,000 kilometers in 1926, which increased to 51,200 kilometers in 1930, which is barely satisfactory. However, considering China's vast territory, it is still only a small amount. As for the fundraising for construction, it was impossible to concentrate financial resources and focus on the essentials, resulting in a fragmented situation, which is also something to be wary of in the future. Speaking of suppressing the communists and bandits, when there were large-scale operations on the front line, there were no troops to dispatch, so the sparks gradually spread into a prairie fire. Speaking of banning opium, although the government had the determination to ban it, it was impossible to stop the cultivation of opium everywhere during the military period, and the concessions that could not be recovered became a breeding ground for opium and bandits. Even without Chinese-produced opium, foreign-produced opium could still be supplied in full. This is definitely not to say that the government recognizes Chinese-produced opium as appropriate, but it is a fact. It is a major obstacle to the government's determination to ban opium and is still a fact that must be recognized. Speaking of the fall in silver prices, it is related to the international market, and there is no effective way to provide relief. Because of the war, national production has declined, and there are few goods to exchange for cash in the world market. Speaking of diplomacy, the shackles of unequal treaties have not yet been completely removed. Each country is waiting and watching to see when China's national unity will be stable. Every time a civil war breaks out, the diplomatic organs are quiet and inactive. Speaking of officialdom, the wind of corruption has not yet been eliminated. The government cannot shirk its responsibility for the failure to implement the supervisory system early, and the deterioration of the general atmosphere is also largely due to the frequent wars and the lack of a fixed order and a proper track in society to confine it. Speaking of disaster relief, the expansion of the disaster area in the Northwest and the injuries and deaths were so numerous that the government could not provide relief. Even the relief funds that were difficult to raise were completely turned into military expenses for Feng Yan's rebellion. Every time I think of the harm caused to the country by the civil war, I cannot help but sigh and hate the heartlessness of the warlords and rebels. Since the military affairs were roughly settled in October 1930, the National Government has been able to start implementing policies on a large scale, so it will never fail to seize this opportunity and has made some progress. In particular, I would like to tell the people of the country about two things."</p>
<p>"(1) The abolition of likin and similar exorbitant taxes is a measure to eliminate a major malpractice of more than half a century and has been urgently demanded by the people for thirty years. Governments have called for it in vain, but they have never been willing to abolish it. Now that it has been swept away, the impact on the future development and circulation of domestic goods and products can be known. However, the thorough completion of this matter still requires the joint supervision of the government and the people. Unfortunately, the benefits of abolishing likin have been partially offset by the loss caused by the tragic fall in silver prices. I do not know if the people could economically endure it if likin were not abolished and silver prices fell tragically."</p>
<p>"(2) Customs autonomy is related to the economic survival of China. The failure of domestic goods to prosper and the inability to protect industry and commerce are all due to the loss of customs autonomy. Over the years, the people of the country have protested, and other countries have deliberately delayed it. However, this year, the National Government has regained autonomy. The importance of this matter to the people's livelihood can only be verified by future facts. As for the issue of recovering legal rights, most countries have recognized it, but three countries are still waiting and watching. However, it will soon be possible to achieve the government's full purpose. The suppression of the communist army in Jiangxi and Hunan has made significant progress, and its main force is about to be defeated. The Huai River diversion and road construction project is proceeding in an orderly manner. The credit of the Central Bank is increasing day by day, and its assets have increased to 200 million yuan. The government dares not take these things as satisfactory. In particular, with regard to diplomatic affairs, we must strive to achieve the complete abolition of unequal treaties. However, this kind of recovery is not without the blessing of the unified and peaceful situation of the past seven months. This is the understanding that our compatriots should have of the value of unity and peace."</p>

<h3 id="e6">The German-Austrian Customs Union Issue <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The German-Austrian Customs Union issue is currently awaiting mediation by the League of Nations Council. Therefore, whether the relationship between Germany, Austria, and France will be restored or broken will depend on the situation at the future meeting. However, judging from the words and actions of both sides, there is a trend of increasing danger. For example, after the French Prime Minister's speech in Conflans stating that France would hardly tolerate the German-Austrian Customs Union, German public opinion strongly criticized it. The more radical ones advocated urging the government to change its foreign policy and withdraw from the League of Nations. Even the more moderate ones expressed dissatisfaction with France. This shows that their feelings are not harmonious, as evidenced by their speeches. As for the measures taken by both sides, they are economically linked. Germany and Austria want to unite Italy, Russia, Turkey, and other countries to form a faction, while France is allied with the Little Entente countries to form a faction. This is already obvious. According to reports from Rome, the foreign ministers of the Little Entente are secretly meeting in Rome, and the King of Romania and the head of Yugoslavia suddenly met on the Danube River, reportedly to discuss the German-Austrian Customs Union. According to reports from Geneva, the Soviet Union and Turkey have expressed their unwillingness to participate in the European Federation conference to discuss European economic matters. Much can be studied from these subtle clues, which are not unrelated to the actions taken by both sides to deal with the customs union. We have received important domestic telegrams.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Entrance of Various Representatives into the Grand Auditorium <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>To fully understand the value of unity and peace and its impact on the future survival of the nation, we should further analyze the international and domestic actual environments, understand the strengths and weaknesses of others, and examine ourselves. This is essential for national planning. Please first observe the international trends, with particular emphasis on their economic development aspects.</p>
<p>(I) The widespread international crisis at present is the economic panic, with the number of unemployed increasing endlessly. Overproduction is a hidden worry for most people. The increase in production in European, American, and Japanese countries after the Great War is an obvious fact. However, if we say that production has reached the point of oversupply, then why have workers and farmers in various countries not been able to enjoy a living standard above a certain level? There are certainly many specialized reasons for disputes, but the main problem lies in the uneven distribution. If this system does not change, then the goods of European, American, and Japanese countries would rather see a portion of their own people lack enjoyment, but for economic benefits, they must transfer it to other countries. Since this distribution system is difficult to change in the short term, the economic aggression of imperialism is also difficult to stop. This is why China, with its backward industry and weak economic resistance, is a cause for concern.</p>
<p>(II) The above is regarding capitalist countries. Even regarding Soviet Russia, which advocates communism, when its Five-Year Plan is completed, it will also be a new force in the world market. With a total mobilization of over 130 million people and the use of 80 trillion rubles of capital, the entire Russian agricultural and industrial fields will be transformed into collective, scientific production, and its scale will be considerable. If it succeeds, its productivity will not be easily underestimated. Now, Soviet Russia is further shortening the five-year period to four years to complete it as soon as possible. Just considering the cotton production business it operates in Central Asia, its rapid progress in quantity will inevitably make China the end point. Moreover, the new road of 1,445 kilometers surrounding the Xinjiang border to connect with the Siberian trunk line was completed last year. Together with the Middle East Railway, which penetrates our Northeast, they form a constant mountain snake force, with a vast territory stretching for thousands of miles. The Chinese people should pay serious attention to all aspects of military, economic, and propaganda.</p>
<p>As for the general trend of politics and military affairs in European, American, and Japanese countries, there is no need to list them one by one. At least in the past five years, the political and military issues between European and American countries are still under the control of economic issues. Whether the reduction of armaments can be successful, especially whether the naval allocation problem can be satisfactorily resolved, as well as France's border defense and Italy's overseas development, all relate to the general trend of international peace. The situation of armed peace in the world has become an undeniable fact. Our country, based on its deep love of peace, sincerely hopes for world peace. But in the unlikely event that a war breaks out internationally, our country should at the very least have sufficient self-defense preparations and further seek to advance its international position. In today's world, our compatriots should constantly pay attention to the international environment to seek a deep understanding and plan for the country's adaptation.</p>
<p>Looking back at the domestic actual environment, we cannot help but feel ashamed and saddened. However, the sick should not avoid doctors. Scientific research should first take facts as the object. China is poor and weak, with hundreds of holes and thousands of sores, and unemployment and backward production are the biggest problems. The lack of popular education, the lack of political experience, and the lack of self-government habits are also important obstacles on the path of national progress. The current evolution of Chinese society is still in the early stages of the European Industrial Revolution, while others have progressed for more than a century. The largest part of what replaces China's handicraft industry is not the domestic machine industry, but the machine industry of other countries. The largest part of those who compete with Chinese labor are not Chinese capital, but the capital of other countries. The country itself</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Statistical undertakings have developed relatively late, and frequent military affairs have led to the fact that sharp industry surveys have not yet been carried out. The total number should be able to drive any country in the world by several times. Just based on what is seen in various places, bandits and vagrants are all unemployed people who have been excluded from the industrial revolution. Foreign factories have taken away their handicraft livelihoods, and the country has no factories to accommodate them. In addition, floods, droughts, famines, and wars have made the unemployed more numerous, and social stability has also been shaken as a result. Every time I think about the situation of backward production in China, if the facts were not all there, I would almost not be able to believe it. China has a population of over 400 million and a land area of over 10,735,454 square kilometers, but the total length of railways in the country is only 12,335 kilometers. Highways have only developed in recent years, and are only 51,210 kilometers, most of which are still dirt roads. Shipping routes, including coastal and inland rivers, are only 12,988 kilometers. The total number of merchant ships is only 439,617 tons, of which British and Japanese foreign merchants operate 326,137 tons. There are also foreign merchants from Norway and other countries with irregular ships of 236,000 tons that have not been included. There is nothing more to say about foreign shipping. As for the national shipbuilding capacity, it is only 10,000 tons per year. There are only 91,130 kilometers of wired telephone lines. There are only 1,105 telegraph offices, averaging one telegraph office for every two counties. There are only a little over 110 wireless machines besides military use. Although there are recently two air routes between Shanghai-Yichang and Beijing, there are only 20 airplanes. The total number of mine workers in the country, including salt mine workers, is estimated to be about one million. As for other factories that can truly use machines to produce on a considerable scale, the number of workers employed is not even close to this. In terms of domestic factory capital, foreign capital is several times that of Chinese capital. Since the tariff autonomy this year, foreign merchants have also changed their investment methods to add factories in China. Since February, the number of factories added by foreign merchants has been as high as about 600, which is also a new trend of economic aggression. If Chinese merchants in industries such as tobacco and cloth are failing day by day, then foreign capital is becoming more prosperous. China claims to be a large and resource-rich country, but the ability of the Chinese people to develop and their entrepreneurial skills are both undeniably weak. Goods are discarded on the ground and supplies are relied upon from others. For example, the imported coal in the 19th year was 2,467,042 tons, with a value of 24,919,475 customs taels, and steel was 8,846,760 dan, with a value of 56,564,903 taels. The total number of kerosene was 185,608,596 gallons, with a total value of 54,864,546 taels. These are all necessary natural products. There is no need to mention that cotton textiles, woolen textiles, etc., are major imports. As a country that claims to be based on agriculture, the value of imported grains in the 18th year was over 14.3 million customs taels, and the value of imported foreign sugar was over 91 million taels. In the 19th year, the value of imported grains was over 13.4 million customs taels, and the value of imported foreign sugar was over 86 million taels. The average annual import tax is over 200 million taels. With backward industries to this extent, only the joint efforts of the government and the people to actively create products can be enough to survive. In terms of education, according to the statistics of the 17th year, the number of students in universities and specialized schools nationwide was 19,453, and the number of middle school students was 234,811. Even in terms of middle school students, there must be an average of one person out of every 1,700 people. The number of elementary school students was over 7 million, but the number of school-age children who did not attend school was still over 35 million. It is estimated that the national illiteracy rate is 80 percent. If the situation of traffic congestion, backward production, and lack of popular education is not fundamentally addressed through a considerable period of time, even with the wisdom of sages, it will be difficult to plan for the country. Zhongzheng lists these facts not to make compatriots feel discouraged, but only the brave can recognize the truth of the facts, and only the wise can seek a way out from the facts. The current objective environment is as difficult as it was in the past few years. The only difference is the situation of unity and peace. Unity and peace cannot be separated. If the overall situation of the country can be taken into consideration and there is a considerable period of time for it to proceed step by step calmly, not only can the government show the effectiveness of construction, but also the capital invested in private businesses will rise like the wind and clouds and cooperate to advance. It goes without saying that foreign capital will be utilized. The people have long hoped for the stability of order. Now, our National Revolutionary Army has offered unity and peace to the people with great sacrifices and long-term struggles. How should the people cherish and protect unity and peace to seek a way out for China, seek China's construction in unity and peace, and seek the survival of the nation and individuals in unity and peace? With firm aspirations and full effort, all those who support unity and peace are considered public friends of the nation, and those who undermine unity and peace are considered public enemies. If we persevere with sincerity and perseverance, the current factual environment will inevitably be conquered, and the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people will be just around the corner.</p>
<p>Now, the gentlemen of the National Assembly are elected by the people to plan for the survival of the country and the nation in the capital. The gentlemen are all elites from all walks of life, but what the gentlemen should consider is the problem of the entire nation, not the problem of a certain sector. The gentlemen come from all parts of the country and overseas, but what the gentlemen are discussing is the problem of the entire country, not the problem of a certain region. The method of planning for the country should focus on the main points, and the focus should be on the big picture. With the virtue and ability of the gentlemen, they should be able to have foresight, without the need for Zhongzheng's humble suggestions. However, the stability of national order, the establishment of national consensus, the development of national economy and people's livelihood, and the implementation of construction plans all depend on the gentlemen's deliberations and rely on the gentlemen to set an example for all compatriots, to change the atmosphere and correct people's hearts. I dare to hope that the gentlemen will pay special attention to the major issues of the constitution and the procedures for industrial construction. The constitution is to establish a consensus and stabilize people's hearts to establish a norm for political and social progress. Only by putting the country on track can the chaos outside the track be eliminated. Zhongzheng believes that this matter is the important mission of the National Assembly, and has repeatedly insisted on it, causing misunderstanding among friends who are usually respected and loved. In fact, there is more than enough pain in my heart. Since the meaning of the constitution is important beyond the norm, its articles should also be simple, practical, and easy to implement. Do not rely on high-sounding words, but seek appropriateness. Do not seek to be different, but seek feasibility. After it is established, the government and the people must establish a heart that is as unshakable as a mountain and have the attitude of sunshine.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Cars Outside the Meeting Hall Door <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Unify the degree and abide by it consistently so that China can achieve governance and peace. As for the procedures for industrial construction, they are also necessary at present. In terms of China's current industrial situation, there is nothing that does not need construction. In terms of China's talent and economy, taking care of everything will inevitably lead to nothing being accomplished. Determine the order of priority and establish a procedure, without extravagance, but limit it to what can be done on a regular basis, and do our best to devote the government and the people to it. As for how to determine and encourage production while at the same time taking into account labor welfare and not going against the economic policy of the People's Livelihood Principle, how to promote education so that it can take into account the livelihood of the people, these kinds of questions are all what the country requires the gentlemen to think deeply about to establish a new foundation for national rejuvenation in history.</p>
<p>To seek the governance of the country, there must be a definite belief, a summary plan, and a unified pace. The Prime Minister advocated the theory of knowing is difficult and doing is easy, which is the only needle to save China's traditional decadent mentality and the only plan to restore the nation's enterprising vitality. Today, the meeting place that we can entrust to gather for discussion is only based on an engineer's design, and it can only be completed on schedule by countless bricklayers and lumberjacks working day and night according to the pre-determined drawings. There is absolutely no reason in the world that engineers gather and fight while workers stand by and watch, so that any building can be completed. The way to build a country is the same. The only principle of building China is the Prime Minister's doctrine, the Prime Minister's strategy, and all the Prime Minister's teachings. If we try to carefully examine and think deeply about it, what doctrine is great, profound, and suitable for China like the Three People's Principles? What strategy is broad, detailed, lofty, and practical like the Prime Minister's hand-determined Outline of National Reconstruction and the Great Outline of National Reconstruction? If it were not from a national leader who is immortal for thousands of years, upholding the spirit of the world for the public and the unchanging will through the ages, then what proposition would be sufficient to give life to the nation's faith, arouse the world's respect, and make hundreds of millions of martyrs break their necks and break their bellies to go to it without regret? Therefore, accepting the Prime Minister's teachings and faithfully striving to carry them out is the way for our Chinese nation to save itself. Now, the country is re-looking at the prosperity of unity and the light of peace. There are many heavy burdens from inheriting the great and throwing in the difficult. However, if we can proceed step by step, we can also move day by day to the realm of construction, perfection, and constitutional completion. Which Chinese does not want long-term stability and advancement to survive? However, long-term stability must be based on long-term peace, and survival depends on advancement. Political phenomena often express the meaning of physical and psychological stability, such as long-term chaos will not produce people, and forgetting chaos must know that liking chaos becomes a habit, and liking governance also becomes a habit. The Chinese people should transform the psychology of liking chaos into the perseverance of seeking governance. Knowing only to hope for governance but not seeking governance will lead to no day of governance. Although the governance, chaos, prosperity, and change of a country are often tied to the psychology of a few who can change the atmosphere, let alone the many talents selected by the national people. The future of the country and the nation is tied to the gentlemen of the National Assembly. Only the representatives can plan together.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Hu Shuhua's Speech <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Representative Hu Shuhua said, Chairman of the National Government, Central Committee members, representatives, and guests, today is the National Government of the Republic of China, following the Prime Minister's teachings and planning for national unity and construction, convening the National Assembly. At the opening of this solemn and great National Assembly, recalling the Prime Minister's will at the time of his death (the recent advocacy for convening the National Assembly and abolishing unequal treaties must be implemented in the shortest possible time), every time we held a memorial week, we would recite it until it was realized now. In addition to being pleased, recalling the many difficulties and hardships in the past six years, relying on the efforts of the Central Committee, representatives from all over the country are able to meet here to express their opinions. This is what the representatives of various provinces and cities should thank the Central Committee for. Recently, the imperialist newspapers spread rumors about whether the National Assembly could be convened. Considering their intentions, after the opening of the National Assembly, they will abolish unequal treaties. Recently, the chairman reported that political aggression is extremely terrible. After the opening of the National Assembly, if the powers cannot automatically abolish them, we will definitely make proper methods so that they will have to abolish them. The general public has been raining for days, thinking that the National Assembly should be clear on the day of opening. In fact, the wind and rain in recent days are just expressing the wind and rain. We should work together in the same boat and expect that there will be a lot of sunshine when the official meeting is held, and the blue sky and white sun will shine all over the world. I wish the success of the National Assembly (applause from the crowd).</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Panchen Erdeni sent an eulogy saying, today is the opening of the National Assembly. Panchen, as a remote person from the western border, is honored to be able to participate in the grand meeting and meet with the representatives of the whole country. Chairman Jiang of our country, following the Prime Minister's doctrine, completed the full achievements of the revolution. He is working hard on political training and construction. The era of constitutional government is about to be completed. He is inheriting the Prime Minister's teachings, convening the National Assembly, consulting the heroes of the group, and cooperating to discuss national affairs, formulating a constitution to permanently solidify the country. It is seen that the blue sky and white sun will always promote the glory of China. The Three People's Principles and Five Powers will always be the model for the world. Panchen is looking at the border situation and speaking his sincere thoughts, thinking of opening the government's long-term plan to quickly save the Tibetan people from misery. He has been running north and south, and his mind and energy are exhausted. Recently, the Kangzang people have been appealing for peace, and he has been deeply compassionate. He hopes that all the gentlemen will broadly relieve the great discussion, rectify the border, follow the Prime Minister's teaching of helping the weak and supporting the weak, consolidate the basis of the country's sovereignty and territory, reassert the prestige of the upper country, and do not abandon the treasures of the West. This is what Panchen is raising his hands and celebrating and sincerely praying for (Special Telegram on the 5th).</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The representatives from various provinces have prepared many proposals. Even the representatives from the Northeast have prepared twenty to thirty proposals. Representatives from other provinces and cities have also prepared many proposals. However, because eighty people are required to co-sign, and the proposals must also be reviewed by the review committee, only a few can be listed on the agenda. In addition, most of the conversations among the representatives focus on local or regional issues, which do not seem necessary to be raised at the People's Congress. Therefore, it is known that even fewer proposals can be submitted for general review. (5th dispatch)</p>

<p>Liu Luyin Delivers the Opening Speech</p>
<p>Wang Qi, Dai Fu-xian Deliver Speeches</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 4 PM on the 5th, people from all walks of life in the capital held a celebration assembly for the National Assembly at the public sports ground. Over 20,000 people attended, including representatives of the National Assembly, party and government officials, military personnel, various organizations, and the general public. Liu Luyin, the chairman, delivered the opening speech, stating that since the Party overthrew the warlords, it has followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will to convene the National Assembly, hoping that the entire country would unite to take on the responsibility of national construction, establish a foundation for peaceful unification, and resolve to abolish all unequal treaties to enhance its international standing, so that the four issues of clothing, food, housing, and transportation for the 400 million compatriots can be satisfactorily resolved. Therefore, the entire people of Nanjing warmly welcome the representatives, and today's grand celebration expresses the infinite hope for the National Assembly. Next, Wang Qi, the Hunan representative to the National Assembly, delivered a speech, stating that the National Assembly aims to achieve unity and construction internally and abolish unequal treaties externally, which is of great significance, and the responsibilities of the representatives are extremely important. Currently, white imperialists are constantly aiming to harm our country, relying on unequal treaties as a shield to invade in every possible way, so the international status is very dangerous. The representatives should work together with the national people to seek the overall interests of the country, hoping that the meeting will achieve satisfactory results to live up to the expectations of the national people. Next, Dai Fu-xian, the representative of the Central National Government, delivered a speech, stating that the Party, under the leadership of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, struggled for many years before overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and establishing the Republic of China. Although the form of government changed at that time, the actual power still remained in the hands of warlords and bureaucrats. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen again led the compatriots across the country to work hard and struggled until he passed away due to overwork. When he was dying, he still eagerly hoped that his comrades would continue his will to complete the unification and construction of China to display the most glorious light of the past 5,000 years.</p>
<p>He also repeatedly instructed his comrades in his will to convene the National Assembly within the shortest possible time and strive to abolish unequal treaties. After Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the comrades of the Party followed his teachings and led the national people to work hard and struggled to eliminate the warlords who oppressed the people and the Communists who disrupted China. Although these achievements are the result of the sacrifices of armed comrades, the greatest strength still lies in the fact that the national compatriots can unanimously support the revolution, which is why we have today. Therefore, if we want to create a foundation for permanent peace and unity in the country in the future, we still need the people to be united in awareness and single-mindedness to achieve this goal. Now that the National Assembly has convened, its goals and tasks are extremely clear. After the Provisional Constitution is formulated and promulgated, the government should strive to achieve unification and construction based on this law, and the national people should also strive to realize it with the spirit of past struggles to create a new era and a new life for China. Finally, representatives from the city's Party headquarters, Lai Lian, and the city government, Xie Mindao, etc., delivered speeches and then shouted slogans, and the meeting concluded.</p>

<p>French Prime Minister Criticizes Tax Treaty Remarks</p>
<p>Causing Consistent Indignation in German Public Opinion</p>
<p>National Press, Rome, 4th - The foreign ministers of the Little Entente are currently holding secret deliberations in Rome, while King Carol of Romania and the Yugoslavian Head of State Alexander suddenly met on the banks of the Danube in Wasuva. The prime ministers of both countries were also present. The matters discussed are unknown because no news has been released and both parties have maintained strict secrecy. According to another report, the two heads of state discussed the German-Austrian tax treaty and France's counterproposal.</p>
<p>National Press, Berlin, 4th - French Prime Minister Laval's speech on Sunday in Connaught, mentioning the German-Austrian tax treaty and saying that France would hardly tolerate it, has caused indignation in German public opinion. The most extreme faction even stated that Germany should change its diplomatic policy as soon as possible and immediately withdraw from the League of Nations. Other newspapers that have always advocated German-French friendship, such as the Berliner Tageblatt, also expressed opposition to Laval's remarks. Even the Germania newspaper, which is peaceful and related to Prime Minister Bruning, stated that Laval's remarks were roughly the same as those of Briand and other French politicians, all groundless accusations. It is suspected that France's psychology is simply that the German-Austrian tax treaty was not approved by France in advance, so it is regarded as detrimental to France's dignity. If that is the case, then France is acting as the master of Europe. In the future, if a sparrow falls from the roof without the prior consent of the French Foreign Ministry, the French can consider it to be related to France's dignity. According to the Germania newspaper's tone, which has always been peaceful, even it is now using strong words, which shows that the French people's arbitrary attacks on an ordinary economic integration have reached an unbearable point.</p>

<p>The Scope of the Agenda is Broad</p>
<p>Disputes Are Inevitable</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th - The International Chamber of Commerce opened its conference today, attended by 1,000 representatives from 47 countries. President Hoover delivered a welcoming speech, urging people in the business community to promote disarmament, as disarmament is the most effective way to restore economic prosperity, which cannot be achieved by any other means. The conference organizers expect this conference to have good results, but the scope of the agenda is broad and disputes may be inevitable. The former chairman, Bessonneis, stated in his speech that high tax rates are one of the root causes of the current economic panic.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 4th - The Chinese Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce submitted a statement to the conference today, requesting active support and immediate convening of an international silver conference, claiming that China is the world's largest user of silver and is prepared to participate in the conference to jointly plan methods to increase and stabilize silver prices.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 4th - The president of the Japanese shipping company stated in his speech at the International Chamber of Commerce conference today that there are many serious commercial problems in the Far East, involving China and the difficulty of trade with China after the fall in silver prices, but solving silver prices must be done by China itself, because the cause of the price drop does not provide a basis for external forces to provide relief.</p>

<p>To Deal with the Catalan Autonomy Movement</p>
<p>Consensus Growing Within the Government</p>
<p>The Interior Minister's Resignation Has Been Withdrawn</p>
<p>The Anarchist Party is Becoming Active</p>
<p>National, Madrid, 5th - The Spanish government has decided to temporarily shelve the issue of allowing the Russian Trotsky to reside in Spain, leaving it to the first Republican government after the election of parliament to resolve. Regarding the central government's attitude towards the Catalan autonomy movement, opinions among cabinet members are gradually converging. Interior Minister Mora has agreed to withdraw his resignation. According to his plan, the number of seats in parliament will be increased from 410 to 600. The country will be divided into 50 districts, with one representative for every 40,000 voters, in order to correct the past imbalance in urban and rural representation.</p>
<p>National Press, Madrid, 4th - Interior Minister Mora suddenly resigned due to disagreements with Prime Minister Zamora over Catalonia. Mora told people that the Prime Minister was too lenient towards the Catalan separatists and lacked decisiveness. At the beginning of the new Republican government, this kind of government is extremely dangerous. At the same time, the domestic anarchist party believes that the establishment of the Republican government is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Barcelona has long been a nest of anarchists, and it is not difficult to take it as a basis for development. Therefore, many flyers are found there every day, inciting the people to quickly rise up, rob the police of their guns, divide the land of the monasteries, and throw the people in the monasteries into the sea. Many anarchists have been arrested there. The central government and the Catalan local authorities have decided to strictly crack down on this kind of illegal activity.</p>

<p>Starting with Estimated Land Prices</p>
<p>The Conservative Party Remains Silent for Now</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden outlined the land tax proposal in the House of Commons today and will present a finance bill, saying that he plans to levy a land tax starting from the 1933 fiscal year, levying one penny per pound per year. Agricultural land will not be taxed, but land prices exceeding agricultural land prices will be taxed. Land used for religious and charitable purposes, cemeteries, city-owned railroads, and public utilities will be exempt from tax. Those with land tax due not exceeding ten shillings will be exempt from tax. The estimation of land prices will begin in October this year and is expected to be completed within two years. The total cost of estimating land prices is estimated to be approximately 1 million to 1.5 million pounds. The method should be simple and direct to avoid disputes. The estimated value will be published to the public and may be used as a basis for the government to collect land and provide compensation and for local areas to collect donations in the future. Conservative Party leaders did not criticize this proposal much and will discuss it when they see the full text of the proposal. Chamberlain said that this tax will make landowners pay another income tax.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 4th – The Foreign Office has not yet received confirmation from its minister in China, Sir Miles Lampson, regarding the breakdown of negotiations on extraterritoriality. It is currently only aware that the negotiations have reached a stalemate. One of the difficulties is the issue of retained areas in Hankou, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjin. In the House of Commons today, when asked which provinces in China are not under the rule of the Nanjing government, the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Henderson, replied that he feared such a situation could not be stated with certainty. The House of Commons also inquired about the extraterritoriality issue. The Foreign Secretary stated that he intended to address the issue of extraterritoriality on May 6th and would not discuss it today. Today, London speculated that the British cruiser HMS Vindictive had been specially dispatched to Nanjing, but the Admiralty and the Foreign Office both claimed to have no knowledge of the ship changing its usual schedule for a special mission. (Note: This ship came to China to replace other British ships and happened to be in Nanjing at the time, but was merely en route to Hankou according to the established schedule. British naval personnel in Shanghai stated that there were no special operations involving British ships in China.)</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – In the House of Commons today, a question was raised as to whether the Chinese government had provided adequate compensation to the former Chief Engineer of the Yuehan Railway, the Briton Mr. Farquhar, when he was dismissed.

<p>Reuters, Beijing, 5th – It has been learned that the former Chief Engineer of the Yuehan Railway, Mr. Farquhar, requested compensation of $39,000, of which $36,000 has already been paid. Therefore, the remaining amount is only $3,000. Important news.</p>

<p>Wu Jingheng Reports on Past Events</p>
<p>At 7:30 AM on May 5th, the Central Party Headquarters held a commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the Premier's inauguration as Extraordinary President. The attendees included Central Committee members Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, Wu Jingheng, Chu Minyi, Zhang Daofan, Miao Peicheng, Dai Fu-xian, Wang Bailing, Yu Youren, Enke Batu, Shao Yuanchong, Ding Weifen, Zhang Renjie, Chen Guofu, Yang Shuzhuang, Kexing'e, Ding Chaowu, He Yingqin, Song Ziwen, as well as guests from various agencies and all staff of the Party Headquarters, totaling over 600 people. Yu Youren presided over the meeting, which commenced with music and the performance of rituals. Wu Jingheng then reported on the past events surrounding the Premier's inauguration as Extraordinary President, stating briefly: “Today, May 5th, is the 10th anniversary of the Premier's inauguration as Extraordinary President. There were many grand events on that day. I will now speak about a minor detail: it was raining this morning, and it was also raining that morning. However, the people of Guangzhou celebrating the Premier's inauguration as Extraordinary President did not diminish their enthusiasm for the celebration at all due to the rain. On that morning, the number of people celebrating in Guangzhou was no less than tens of thousands. At that time, I was going to the Premier's office and was already crowded by the people in front of the Finance Department and could no longer move forward. Later, when I was about to go to France, the Premier summoned me and said that there were important things to discuss, which was to say that becoming the Extraordinary President was due to the various difficulties in the revolutionary and national salvation environment. The Northern Government had no value, and if there was no central construction in the government, the people would inevitably be disappointed. The Premier's inauguration as Extraordinary President was entirely due to the people's expectations. The Premier did not regard becoming President as a matter of glory, but rather as a matter of national salvation. He said that many of the people celebrating at that time did not hold the hope of being promoted or getting rich but were entirely driven by patriotic enthusiasm. Furthermore, when the Premier first took office as President of the Nanjing Government, I had just arrived in Shanghai from abroad and only came to Nanjing to see the Premier on January 4th. At that time, even though the Premier had taken office as President, he was still the same as usual. The room was still full of comrades, and everyone discussed state affairs as usual. The Premier said that becoming President was to cope with the environment, and the purpose was entirely for national salvation. The Premier suffered misfortune and went to Shanghai, and later returned to Guangdong. At that time, the environment was only for dealing with warlords and military affairs. The Premier was no longer determined to be President, and instead took the position of Grand Marshal and organized the Grand Marshal's Office in Guangzhou. The Premier's assumption of the positions of President and Grand Marshal were all due to the environmental needs for national salvation. The Premier did not regard the positions of President and Grand Marshal as a matter of course and always kept them in mind. Therefore, in the first year of the Republic of China, he did not regard the transfer of the Presidency to Yuan Shikai as a matter of course. However, because Yuan Shikai wanted to be emperor after becoming President, the Premier had to rise up again to oppose Yuan for national salvation. The Premier was not afraid of thousands of difficulties and setbacks in saving the country and always wanted to achieve the goal of saving China and achieving freedom and equality for China. The Premier told us that the few things that could not be forgotten the most were the few things that were solemnly entrusted to comrades. What are these few things? They are the last few words on the will (the recent proposals to convene a National Assembly and abolish unequal treaties must be realized in the shortest possible time). This is what should be done after unification and is no longer a problem. Also, the two sentences (the revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard) include everything that we should work hard to do. The opening ceremony of the National Assembly is held on today's May 5th anniversary, which has great significance. The people's celebration of the National Assembly today is also extraordinary. These are all the spirits of the Premier in heaven, as if above him, as if on his left and right, constantly monitoring us and helping us to achieve these good phenomena. My last wish is still the Premier's two sentences (the revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard), and I hope that comrades must work together. This is the meaning of today's commemoration.)” After the speech, the ceremony was completed and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Guangdong Central Bank Announces Suspension of Cash Redemption <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Value of Central Bank Notes Drops to 80%</p>
<p>Suspension of Tax Collection Also Announced for May</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence – Since the Guangdong Provincial Central Bank experienced a run on April 27th, the number of people redeeming cash has been increasing daily. Until April 30th, rumors suddenly arose, and people became panicked. Therefore, on that day, the Central Bank and its Yonghan Road branch and Xidi office redeemed over ten thousand in cash. On that day, redemption was limited. Those with a small number of Central Bank notes, less than 100 yuan, could redeem them immediately, while those with several hundred to thousands of yuan were restricted. However, the Central Bank and its branch offices always had several hundred people from morning till evening, and they only dispersed after the suspension of redemption in the evening. Furthermore, the Jiangmen branch also experienced a run in recent days, redeeming about ten thousand in cash each day. As a result, the value of Central Bank notes continued to decline. When purchasing Hong Kong dollars with Central Bank notes, a discount of 650 yuan per thousand yuan was required. Some unofficial exchanges valued Central Bank notes at about 80% of cash value. The authorities were still concerned that the Central Bank would suffer a more severe run due to the influence of the situation, so they planned to temporarily announce the suspension of Central Bank redemption at an appropriate time to maintain the Central Bank's funds. The Central Bank notes that were discounted were to be bought and sold on the market. On May 1st, after Deng Zeru, Gu Yingfen, Lin Sen, and Xiao Focheng issued their telegram, the Central Bank also issued a notice of suspension of redemption, stating: "Now, by order of the Eighth Route Commander, with rumors rampant and people shaken, the Bank's banknotes are declining daily and are difficult to maintain. It is ordered that redemption be temporarily suspended from May 1st to await reorganization. Please comply accordingly, etc. This order is hereby notified to all branches, which shall comply immediately. This notice is given separately. (Director Shen Zaihe, Deputy Director Yang Jianping)" After the Central Bank suspended redemption, all branches also ceased redemption. As for all tax revenues of the Finance Department related to April, Central Bank notes are still accepted. Tax revenues for May will be temporarily suspended. It is rumored that a new method of paying taxes will be formulated. (May 1st)</p>

<p>Vow to Avenge Martyred Compatriots</p>
<p>Japanese Residents in Jinan Close Their Doors and Do Not Venture Out</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence – The May 3rd Massacre is a great shame and humiliation for our country. From May 3, 1928, to today, three years have passed in the blink of an eye. The people of Jinan, suffering deep pain, are particularly heartbroken and indignant. This year, the May Revolution Memorial Day Preparatory Committee made early preparations to hold a memorial meeting for the third anniversary of the May 3rd Massacre at the Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters on the 3rd. Notices were issued to various agencies, schools, and businesses to fly flags at half-mast and close for one day. Slogans were posted throughout the city and suburbs. The Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters, Licheng County Party Headquarters, and May Revolution Memorial Day Preparatory Committee all published proclamations to the people to alert the public. On this day, the Shandong Executive Department of the Korean Great Independence Party also distributed a letter to Chinese comrades to commemorate the May 3rd Massacre in China. The atmosphere in the city suddenly became tense, and the people expressed deep sorrow. As for the opening of the memorial meeting, from 9:00 AM, more than a thousand representatives from all walks of life gathered in the auditorium of the Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters for the meeting. In the center of the auditorium was set up the spiritual tablet of the martyrs of the May 3rd Massacre. The chairman of the Shandong Provincial Rectification Committee, Zhang Weicun, presided over the meeting. Then, mournful music was played, and all bowed three times to the national flag, the Premier's portrait, and the spiritual tablets of Cai Gongshi and the martyrs of the May 3rd. Flower wreaths were offered, and a memorial text was read. The chairman then reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating briefly: "On this day in 1928, many revolutionary armed forces and volunteers were massacred by Japanese imperialists in an inhumane manner, which is most distressing. Japan dreamed of using force to achieve its ambitions of aggression. Zhang Zongchang wanted to use foreign forces to maintain his power, and they colluded with each other, thus causing this massacre. This is not only an unprecedented humiliation for our country but also a rare tragedy in the world. Today, we are holding the third anniversary memorial meeting. Everyone must work together to wash away the shame and prevent the recurrence of collusion between warlords and imperialists. I still remember that in 1928, Japanese imperialists could not stop the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army. Now that the foundation of the Party and the country is solid, as long as the people of the country are not pessimistic and negative, then in the near future, we can defeat all the dreams of imperialists and wash away the shame of the May 3rd Massacre." Then, Wang Fangting, the director of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, Wu Zhenzan, the president of the Shandong High Court, Zhang Hongjian, the head of the Provincial Rectification Committee, and Wang Xiangrong, the director of the Department of Finance, gave speeches. At 10:30 AM, slogans were shouted, and photographs were taken before the meeting adjourned. The slogans of the meeting were: "Never forget the great shame and humiliation of May 3rd, rigorously implement economic severance with Japan, abolish all unequal treaties, supervise the government to rigorously implement revolutionary diplomacy, overthrow Japanese imperialism, vow to avenge the martyred compatriots of May 3rd, complete the National Revolution, Long live the Chinese Kuomintang, Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation." Furthermore, the Japanese Consul in Jinan, Nishida Koichi, had instructed Japanese residents in Jinan not to go out on the 3rd to avoid accidents. The Japanese residents also told each other to close their doors and not venture into the streets. Therefore, there were no traces of Japanese on the market on that day. (Month 3rd)</p>

<p>Sends Councilor Shang Wenli to Wuhu</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence – Supervisory Yuan Councilor Shang Wenli arrived in Wuhu on the 3rd by order from Beijing to investigate whether taxes and levies were being collected under false pretenses after the abolition of likin. On the 4th, Mr. Shang personally consulted with the County Chamber of Commerce and various agencies on all matters. According to Mr. Shang's statement, “The Anhui Province's current borrowing of one million yuan in rice public bonds, according to the Chamber of Commerce, is for construction purposes and does not harm people's livelihoods, so it can be carried out. However, public bonds cannot be raised by levying rice taxes. As for the five inland regular customs, according to the general outline for the implementation of likin abolition, they should have been abolished by the end of November of last year. The reason why the Wuhu Regular Customs has not been abolished is that the plan has not yet been fully detailed. It is planned to investigate in detail and then submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval. I will stay in Wuhu for about three or four days. Once completed, I will go to Anqing, Datong, Tunxi, and other places to investigate.” (4th)</p>

<p>The bandits in southern Jinshan are rampant again. The banditry in Jinshan temporarily subsided after the execution of the bandit leaders Taibao Ashu, Zhudu, and Amei, but along the coast from Jinshanwei to Fuwangdai, the bandit leader Lu Yaosheng's subordinates still number in the hundreds and have not been eliminated. In recent days, the families of Monk Nan Yang in Fuwangdai, Tan Liuxian in northeast Jinshanwei, and Hou Zijian in Xinqiaotou have been robbed, losing hundreds of silver dollars and clothing.</p>

<p>Due to a clash during an arrest of gamblers by the Fengsong police team, Patrol Captain Zhang Yufang of the Public Security Bureau was ordered yesterday to go to Hujiaqiao to arrest gamblers. He arrested thirteen gamblers in the Xinxin Tea Garden in the town. While escorting them in batches, the Songjiang County Police First Squad stationed there came out to obstruct, causing a conflict, resulting in serious injuries to the Patrol Captain and others. He immediately went to the county overnight to report the incident. The chief of the sub-bureau, Zhu Huaiyi, approached the head of the Zhu sub-squad to negotiate, but without result. The county government has now requested the Songjiang County to thoroughly investigate the situation and has sealed up the Xinxin Tea Garden for investigation.</p>

<p>Zhang Yongqing commits suicide due to economic pressure. Zhang Yongqing, 47 years old, of the Huachang Cloth Store on the Yutou River along the Huangniqiao outside the North Gate of this county, has been experiencing sluggish business in recent years, leading to increasing financial difficulties. The other day, he was stimulated by economic problems and conceived the idea of suicide. He immediately went out alone to a pharmacy and bought two bottles of "Florida" calming pills and took fifteen pills alone when going to bed at night to die. The next day, his son Zuyin pushed the door open and went in to comfort his father and saw his face pale and unconscious, knowing that he had taken poison. He immediately took him to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. According to Dr. Zhu, the poisoning was mild and there was no danger to his life.</p>
<p>The police team kills the bandit leader. Zhou Jiashan, the director of the Eighth Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau of this county, captured a bandit named Zhu Genda a few days ago in Yuanfu Bay, Zhoutanqiao, Xin'an Township. After interrogation, he was transferred to the county government. Magistrate Pan Xun personally interrogated the suspect in court. The suspect confessed in court that the bandit leader Hang Zubei was now hiding in the home of the Mud Bridge in Junzhang Mountain, Nanfangquan, Kaihua Township, in the 14th District, etc. After Magistrate Pan obtained the confession, he secretly ordered the police captain Wang Wei to send a special agent Wang Jinbiao to lead five team members to the countryside to arrest the bandit leader Hang Zubei and his two accomplices. Upon seeing the detectives arrive, they dared to open fire and resist arrest. The special agents also returned fire and shot the bandit Hang in the left shoulder and leg, causing him to fall to the ground and die. The remaining two bandits, seeing the situation was not good, fled in succession. Afterwards, Special Agent Wang reported to Captain Wang Wei by telephone. Captain Wang Wei hired an open boat at 9:00 AM yesterday (5th) and transported the body of the slain bandit leader Hang Zubei to the boat. It was towed by a steamship to the city and docked under the Gongyun Bridge. Captain Wang reported to the county government. Magistrate Pan reported to the county court and requested that personnel be sent to verify the identity.</p>

<p>Villagers in Lishan Township brutally murdered by bandits. Jiang Longda and Jiang Sanda, brothers and villagers in Lishan Township in the Sixth District, usually harbored enmity towards bandits and assisted the authorities in detaining them, leading to resentment from the bandits. They had fled to other places to avoid them. The other day, Longda returned home for business and was detected by bandits on the first day at about 8:00 PM. He was brutally murdered by the bandits, and his head was cut off and thrown into a wheat field. On the 2nd, County Magistrate Li went to the countryside to inspect the work of cleaning up bandits. Upon hearing the report from the Sixth District Office, he personally went to inspect. The 　Tangqiao was robbed and injured. On the night of the 2nd, the Su family in Huangtangqiao outside the East Gate was robbed, and the owner and his wife were injured by bullets.

<p>A cotton boat encounters thieves midway. Han Hongsheng from Pudong, Shanghai, opened the Hongji Flower Shop in Songsha Town, Weixi, specializing in purchasing cotton for various flower factories in Shanghai. This time, he purchased more than 500 bales of pure white flowers. The other day, he loaded them onto a sea boat from Tancun in the town to Shen. As soon as the boat sailed out of the back sea, it suddenly encountered a pirate boat, which robbed it. At the same time, a boat of live pigs from the north of the sea was also robbed. After the pig boat owner reported it, the Yongping warship, which was patrolling, opened its engines to pursue. They encountered each other in the Taizhou waters, and the two sides opened fire. As a result, the bandits were no match and abandoned the flower boat. The boat was then taken to Haimen by the Yongping warship. After the owner Han Hongsheng learned of this, he rushed to collect it and requested that the original ship escort it to Shanghai. The loss of goods in this battle was more than 2,000 gold.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Ministry of Education Orders Investigation and Prohibition of Private Excavation of Antiquities <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education jointly issued a decree to the Education Bureaus of each province and city to investigate and prohibit the private excavation of antiquities:</p>
<p>According to the report submitted by Zhang Ji, Chairman of the Antiquities Preservation Committee, Li Chengmei, a resident of Jixian County, Henan Province, privately excavated antiquities and sold them to foreigners. Please inform the government of Henan Province and order the County Government to strictly investigate and handle the matter. Please also issue a decree to all provinces to strictly prohibit private excavation. In addition to separately consulting, a copy of the original report is hereby issued to order (the Bureau) (Hall) to comply with the Antiquities Preservation Law and strictly prohibit private excavation to value antiquities. This decree is issued with a copy of the original report. The report is to earnestly request the issuance of a decree to all provinces to prohibit excavation in order to protect antiquities. It was found that in January of this year, the Henan Minbao reported that Li Chengmei, the village director of Shanbiao Village, west of Jixian County, discovered an ancient tomb while excavating a water pond and excavated the tomb, unearthing more than 300 pieces of ancient bronzes, including large and small bronze tripods, bronze helmets, bronze lances, and bronze plates. A major antique dealer privately transported them to Tianjin and sold them to foreigners, earning more than 300,000 yuan. I immediately sent a letter to the Henan Provincial Government, requesting a thorough investigation and handling of the case. On the 26th of last month, I received a reply from the Provincial Government, No. 1013, which stated that the previous large letter was read in the Henan Minbao that Li Chengmei, the village director of Shanbiao Village, Jixian County, excavated a water pond and found 300 ancient bronzes and privately sold them to foreigners, regardless of whether it was true or false. The reply was requested, so Jixian County was ordered to investigate and reply. Now, according to the district chief Zhao Tingqu of the district, it was found that in June of last year, Li Chengmei, the village director of Shanbiao Town, was instructed by the former County Magistrate Zhao Ruhu and commissioned by the Fourth Army and appointed members Cui Shibiao and Wei to supervise the excavation of antiquities within 100 steps of the village's western land. No idlers were allowed to watch. All excavated antiquities were handed over to the members and sent to County Magistrate Zhao for transfer to the Fourth Army. Although Li Chengmei was instructed by the former County Magistrate Zhao to assist, he only belonged to the committee's reception affairs, and it was not known how many antiquities were excavated. He also presented the instruction and a letter given by the former County Magistrate Zhao. Later, Gao Weibin, the director of the Public Security Bureau, also presented the same report from the former County Magistrate. The County Magistrate was still afraid that the investigation was not true, so he again subpoenaed Li Chengmei for interrogation. According to the confession, in June of last year, he was instructed by the former County Magistrate Zhao to be commissioned by the Fourth Army to appoint members Cui and Wei to supervise the excavation and ordered the people to assist. The people hired two or thirty coolies to dig out the objects, which were all handed over by the members to the county government and sent to the Fourth Army. It is not clear whether they were sold to foreigners. There were no scattered small items in the people's homes, and they had not sold any antiquities. The former reason for the order was to place Li Chengmei on bail to await investigation. The investigation situation and the submitted instructions and letters are hereby presented to the Government for examination and approval. Also attached are the original letter and instructions. According to this, in addition to instructing, a copy of the original attachments is sent to the Bureau for investigation and verification. It was found that Article 7 of the Antiquities Preservation Law promulgated by the National Government on June 2, stated that antiquities buried underground and exposed to the surface are all owned by the state. Article 8 also stated that the excavation of antiquities should be carried out by academic institutions directly under the central or local government. The regulations are extremely strict, but in each province, because the eyes and ears of the central government are not available or relying on their special power, there are still cases of private excavation that do not comply with the law. It is thought that the archaeology of our country is still in its infancy, and the underground is rich in wealth. The promotion of our country's thousands of years of historical culture depends entirely on this. If we allow the ignorant to privately excavate, mess up the geological layers, and obliterate historical traces, the loss will be difficult to count. Moreover, the purpose of their excavation is to privately sell antiquities to foreigners in the hope of obtaining heavy capital. One person makes a profit, and the group follows suit. The momentum will not stop until the antiquities of our country are destroyed. The power of the association and what it sees and hears are limited, and it is impossible to prevent it. Dare to present to the department that in addition to the Jixian case this time, the Henan Provincial Government should be ordered to strictly investigate the case and track down the original excavated antiquities and send them to the national cultural institutions for safekeeping. Regarding the private excavation in the future, it is also proposed that the department issue a decree to all provinces to strictly prohibit it as a warning to the past and to be careful in the future. Is it appropriate? I respectfully request the investigation and approval of the Ministry of Education, Antiquities Preservation Committee, Director Zhang Ji, 20.4.7.</p>

<p>The Current State of Chinese Students Studying in Japan</p>
<p>China sends more students to Japan than to any other foreign country. The reasons for this are: (1) the expenses are relatively low and easy to bear; (2) the written language is easier to learn, and the preparatory period is shorter; (3) transportation is convenient, and the journey takes only three or four days. Recently, however, due to the soaring price of gold and the increasing cost of living in Japan, Chinese students studying in Japan generally feel considerable hardship, often facing financial difficulties. Those who rely on government funding seem to find it as unattainable as the mythical Mount Shen, or they repeatedly request funding, but the provincial authorities ignore their requests or even directly reject them, a truly pitiful situation. Since arriving in Japan, the reporter has witnessed four or five students returning home due to a lack of funds to sustain themselves. Yesterday, I accepted an invitation from the Tokyo Middle School Youth Association to give a lecture. After the lecture, I met many Chinese students in Japan and learned in great detail about their situation. The majority are diligent and hardworking in their studies, with some eating only one meal a day, and others filling their hunger with cold bread. This spirit of perseverance and dedication is admirable and praiseworthy. There are also a small number of people who, in their home country, held official positions or military ranks, and who brought their families here to observe or prepare for study, and whose lives are relatively comfortable. As for those who indulge in frivolous pursuits and willingly degenerate, although they are not absent, they are extremely few in number. Currently, there are a total of 3,064 Chinese students studying in Japan (according to the latest survey by the Japan-China Academic Association). The largest number of students are from Guangdong Province, followed by Liaoning Province. The breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong: 563 students; Liaoning: 551 students; Zhejiang: 195 students; Sichuan: 206 students; Hunan: 156 students; Jiangsu: 167 students; Hubei: 135 students; Hebei: 124 students; Anhui: 93 students; Guangxi: 49 students; Shanxi: 37 students; Shandong: 74 students; Jiangxi: 224 students; Heilongjiang: 56 students; Xinjiang: 3 students; Fujian: 165 students; Shaanxi: 38 students; Rehe: 6 students; Jilin: 85 students; Guizhou: 14 students; Gansu: 5 students; Yunnan: 69 students; Suiyuan: 11 students; Mongolia: 4 students. Only Tibet, Qinghai, Chahar, and other places have no students studying abroad. As for their fields of study, the most recent survey lists them as follows: Law: 465 students (Law, Politics, Sociology); Economics: 386 students (Commerce, Economics); Military Science: 339 students (Army); Engineering: 238 students (Electrical, Mechanical, Civil, Mining, Applied Chemistry, Silk); Arts: 232 students (Literature, Education, Religion); Railway Engineering: 143 students (128 students at the Tokyo Railway Bureau Training Institute); Science: 138 students; Medicine: 136 students; Agriculture: 81 students (Agriculture, Forestry, Horticulture); Fine Arts: 51 students; Aviation: 23 students; Music: 13 students; Special Subjects: 6 students; Preparatory School, Preparatory Courses, and Other: 813 students.</p>
<p>The most popular subjects are law and politics, followed by military science and engineering. Whether this phenomenon warrants further investigation is a question to be considered. Most students study in Tokyo, with a total of 2,503 students. Kyoto, Nagasaki, Fukuoka, and Hiroshima are next. However, in Osaka, a highly developed industrial center, there are only 16 Chinese students. This shows that young people in our country have not yet paid enough attention to industrial education.</p>
<h3 id="e67">A Glimpse of Teacher Education in Japan <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Japanese normal schools are quite developed, with the most famous being the Aoyama Normal School and the Toyoshima Normal School. I spent two and a half days visiting each of them and spoke with the authorities of both schools. My brief notes are as follows: Aoyama Normal School was founded in the ninth year of Meiji and is the oldest normal school in Japan. Principal Hasegawa Otsuhiko and Dean Yamada Ikejiro guided me through the school's facilities, classrooms, and dormitories. The school is divided into: Part 1, a five-year program for graduates of higher elementary schools; Part 2, a two-year program for graduates of middle schools; a specialized course of one year for graduates of normal schools and regular teachers of undergraduate programs; and a training course of three years for regular teachers of ordinary elementary schools and above. Half of the students serve in rural areas and half in urban areas after graduation. The school has 627 students, and their prospects are not bad. The school has special classrooms for history, geography, botany, physics, and chemistry, each with dedicated teachers, which is worth emulating. Students collect and manufacture specimens themselves and emphasize manual work. A workshop is specially set up for students to practice, which is also commendable. Toyoshima Normal School was founded in the 41st year of Meiji. Principal Sakuraba Kenji guided me through all departments and sections. This school is also divided into four parts: Part 1, Part 2, Specialized Course, and Training Course. The school has a total of 585 students. It places special emphasis on practical subjects, especially agriculture, with 3,000 tsubo of farmland for students to practice, divided into experimental areas, which is quite interesting. At the same time, students are sent to rural areas to visit, interview, and interact with farmers. More graduates wish to serve in urban areas than in rural areas. Teachers' salaries must be higher in urban areas to encourage graduates to take on rural teaching positions. The school pays special attention to botany, physics, chemistry, and manual work. The Department of Education pays special attention to psychological testing and career guidance, especially citizenship training and character development. Colleagues asked the authorities of both schools several questions, which are presented below: (Question) Should normal schools and middle schools be established independently or jointly? (Answer) The purposes and policies of the two types of schools are completely different. Normal schools should be established independently. (Question) What are your opinions on the issue of coeducation for boys and girls in secondary schools? (Answer) The national conditions, national character, and social organization of each country are different. In our country, boys and girls can be coeducated in universities and elementary schools, but it seems that the time is not yet ripe for secondary schools. (Question) Does your school pay attention to the service guidance of graduates? (Answer) We pay close attention. We provide guidance on academic knowledge, self-cultivation methods, and research. We especially encourage rural teachers to have more contact with farmers. (Question) What are your opinions on the reform of secondary schools? (Answer) We strongly advocate the reform of the secondary school system. Recently, the Ministry of Education divided secondary schools into two groups so that students can have different paths for further education and employment, and pay attention to production and vocational education, which is especially important. However, we regret that we cannot fully promote vocational schools due to economic limitations. (Question) Are your schools preparing rural teachers and ordinary teachers in the same way? (Answer) The level is the same, but the teaching materials are different. (Question) What are your opinions on the issue of sex education? (Answer) This matter is extremely important. When the opportunity arises, the principal, school doctor, and natural history teacher provide indirect guidance and impart physiological knowledge. (Question) Is the internship period for graduates too short? (Answer) We have also felt this. At present, we hope to reduce the number of students and set up more affiliated elementary schools to give students more opportunities for practice. (Question) What are the recent new trends in education? (Answer) It is best for normal schools to divide into departments in the fifth year so that students can specialize and delve deeper, rather than being broad but not precise, and superficial but not deep. (Question) What methods are used to influence students? (Answer) It is best to have teachers with high moral character take on the duties of moral education so that they can serve as role models and provide intangible influence on personality. After visiting the above schools, I noted several common advantages and present them to the people of our country: (1) All schools emphasize character training, so students absolutely abide by discipline, pursue practical learning, and have the virtues of loyalty and the spirit of self-discipline. (2) All schools spare no expense in paying special attention to botany, physics, chemistry, and other subjects, each with extremely sophisticated experimental equipment, and employ full-time personnel to conduct research and experiments without reservation, including geography and history (3) Special classrooms are set up for teachers to concentrate on research. (3) All schools have manual arts classrooms and woodworking shops to engage in productive work, so that students develop the habit of working and the concept of production from an early age. (4) All schools pay special attention to extracurricular activities to cultivate students' ability to be active and serve the community. (5) All schools pay special attention to military drills (military training) and martial arts such as kendo, judo, and wrestling to continue the spirit of Japanese bushido. (6) They pay close attention to the contact with students' parents and hold various gatherings at any time and place.</p>

<p>The result was five to zero.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second Sino-Western YMCA handball match. The location was still at the Western YMCA. There were three singles matches and two doubles matches. Both sides promoted sportsmanship, and there were no judges to referee. The match proceeded quite smoothly. The previous loss of the Chinese Youth team was due to unfamiliarity with the venue and different rules. In terms of strength, the Chinese Youth team was no less than the Western YMCA. Yesterday, the number of players who went into battle were all able to cope with ease, and they were able to score as they wished, which was completely different from the last time. The Western YMCA players were greatly surprised. As a result, the Chinese Youth team won completely with a score of five to zero. It is reported that the Western YMCA also plans to play again at the Chinese Youth YMCA next week. The results are attached below. Singles:</p>
<p>(1) Zhu Kuan won against Lai Mai 21-8, 21-3 (2-0) (2) Hong Yukui won against Nasi 21-4, 21-12 (2-0) (3) Hong Yukui won against Tengna 21-7, 21-10 (2-0) Doubles:</p>

<p>The Shanghai Fazzan Law School basketball team, led by the team leader Tan Kwei, led the elite troops in a mighty manner towards Hankou.

The game against Wenhua University was tied, and the victory or defeat could not be determined. Due to the lateness of the hour, it was forced to be called off. Only in the battle with Jianguang was it defeated by one point. In total, it won five, drew one, and lost one out of seven battles. The campaign in Hankou can be said to have been successful and returned. The full list of team members includes team leader Tan Da, team captain Feng Zuo, secretary Pan Junzao, and team members Lu Bin, Li Yongwen, Li Zhongshan, Mian Yuan, Chen Hualu, and Chen Yumeng.</p>

<p>Excellent results in long jump and high jump</p>
<p>The Wusong Merchant Marine School held its track and field sports meet on the 4th. Xu Yanzhi was the chief referee. As a result, Liang Tiancheng's long jump result of 6.55 meters broke the highest record of the past year's National Games, with only a slight difference compared to the highest national record of all previous sports meets (6.74 meters). Chen Tianhe's high jump result of 1.60 meters was only slightly lower than the national record of 1.793 meters. The 100-meter race result was 12.5 seconds, and the 1,500-meter result was 5 minutes and 11 seconds, both of which were good records. However, the results were inevitably inferior due to wind direction. A unique event was the 100-meter water-carrying race for porters. The winner was determined by the steadiness and speed of the steps and the absence of water spillage. Yang, the acting principal of the school, specially awarded the first place winners of the school porters and the 100-meter race for water carriers with ten yuan each to show encouragement. The first place in the individual total score was Liang Tiancheng, and the first place in the group total score was the second grade of the driving department.</p>

<h3 id="e86">The Municipal Community Held Two Grand Ceremonies Yesterday <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Celebrating the Opening of the National Assembly</p>
<p>Commemorating the Establishment of the Revolutionary Government</p>
<p>Two Proposals Passed</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, representatives from all sectors of the city gathered at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to celebrate the opening of the National Assembly and the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government. Over a thousand people were in attendance. Yu Hongjun, Xiong Shihui, Ye Huijun, Yang Qingyuan, Lu Jingshi, Zhu Yingpeng, and Lin Kecong served as the presidium, with Chen Ming and Zhou Hanmei as recorders. The chairman delivered the opening address, followed by speeches from Yu Hongjun, Ye Huijun, Zhu Yingpeng, Jin Xihan, and others, who elaborated on the significance of the National Assembly and the Revolutionary Government. The details of the general assembly are recorded below:</p>
<p>Assembly Order: (1) Everyone stands at attention. (2) Music is played. (3) The party anthem is sung. (4) The most respectful salute is given to the Party, the national flag, and the portrait of the late Premier. (5) The late Premier's will is respectfully read. (6) A moment of silence is observed. (7) The chairman gives a report. (8) Speeches are delivered. (9) Slogans are shouted. (10) Music is played. (11) The meeting is adjourned.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Today's celebration has two meanings: (1) celebrating the opening of the National Assembly; (2) celebrating the anniversary of the Premier's inauguration as Extraordinary President. The National Assembly, which is the unified expectation of the nation, opens today in the capital. It gathers the nation's elite in one place to discuss national affairs, marking the most magnificent and glorious page in Chinese revolutionary history. To create a new society and build a new country, we must first cultivate democratic forces. To cultivate democratic forces, we must first enable the people to understand our Party's doctrine, accept our Party's leadership, and participate in our Party's national revolution. This is why the National Assembly is convened. During the era of the Northern Warlords, China fell into utter chaos. Yuan Shikai, Duan Qirui, Cao Kun, Wu Peifu, and others successively trampled on the Republic of China, exploited the common people, and divided the revolutionary forces of our Party. All the imperialist countries took the opportunity to loot and plunder. Internal and external troubles pressed in, causing the country to fall into a semi-colonial status, and the people were plunged into deep water and scorching fire. The horror of being partitioned like melons and beans, facing national subjugation and racial extinction, was imminent. Thinking of this, one cannot help but feel chilled. At this critical moment of survival, the Premier assumed the office of Extraordinary President in Guangzhou in the tenth year of the Republic (1921), igniting the flame of revolution, advocating resistance against the traitorous government, overthrowing the warlords, and overthrowing imperialism, running around and appealing in the hope of awakening the dead hearts and recalling the almost exhausted national soul. As a result, the atmosphere of revolution permeated the land, and the nation's last breath was extended. After Cao Kun and Wu Peifu were overthrown in the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), the Premier went north to advocate the convocation of a National Assembly to resolve national issues, but it failed to materialize due to various obstacles. He felt depressed and ended his life. In his will, he clearly showed us (recently advocated opening the National Assembly). The Premier's determination to convene the National Assembly is evident. Since the Premier's passing, the spirit of our Party comrades fighting for the Chinese revolution has not diminished in the slightest due to the Premier's death. On the contrary, we have turned grief into strength and become more vigorous and worked harder. In the autumn of the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926), we swore to begin the Northern Expedition and, within a few months, established Wuhan and swept directly to Jiangsu and Zhejiang. We could have unified the country, convened the National Assembly, and abolished the unequal treaties to comfort the Premier's spirit in heaven. However, the Party and the country faced many misfortunes. The Red Bandits wreaked havoc in the front, and the new warlords successively rebelled in the rear. A hasty convocation would likely not yield good results. Since last autumn, the remaining reactionary forces have gradually been suppressed, the new warlords have been completely eliminated, and the Red Bandits have been driven to the brink of destruction. The Central Government followed the late Premier's teachings and convened the National Assembly. The purpose of the convocation is to make public our Party's doctrine, our Party's program, our Party's important resolutions, our Party's basic propositions on Chinese politics and economy, and the achievements of the years of political tutelage, so that the people of the whole country can understand, support the revolution, and unite their efforts to complete the revolutionary cause. Other key points to be discussed at this meeting include automatically declaring the abolition of unequal treaties, recovering all national concessions, and how to effectively implement the equalization of land ownership and the regulation of capital. This National Assembly will have a very detailed discussion and extremely appropriate solutions on the political and economic aspects of China in the future. Representatives, please wait and see.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches: (1) Yu Hongjun's speech. (2) Zhu Yingpeng's speech. (3) Ye Huijun's speech, length omitted. The representatives from all sectors completed their speeches and then discussed the proposals, passing two important proposals: (1) telegraphic congratulations on the opening of the National Assembly; (2) telegram to the Shanghai representatives urging them to strive for the abolition of unequal treaties at the assembly.</p>
<p>Telegram of Congratulations on the Opening: To the Presidium and all Representatives of the National Assembly: Looking back since our country's reform, many years have passed, but reactionary elements have been causing trouble from within, and the remaining warlords have successively run rampant, so that politics has not been put on the right track and political tutelage has not been effectively implemented. Speaking of this, it is truly regrettable. Now, fortunately, the rebellious elements have been quelled, and the petty villains have disappeared. The National Government, carrying on the late Premier's will and responding to the demands of the people, resolutely opened the National Assembly in the capital on May 5th, gathering the nation's elite to discuss national affairs together. It is expected that everyone will express their broad opinions and work together to plan for the future, so that politics can be put on the right track and construction can proceed step by step, laying the foundation of the Party and the country on an unshakeable foundation and planting boundless blessings for the people. Hearing this from afar, we are overjoyed. We respectfully send this telegram to express our sincere wishes. We ask for your consideration. The Shanghai community celebrates the opening of the National Assembly and the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Representatives: To the Shanghai Representatives to the National Assembly in Nanjing, Wu Kaixian, Hou Dachun, Wang Tingsong, Hu Shuhua, Chen Guansheng, and all gentlemen: The shackles of unequal treaties on our country have lasted for a long time. Sovereignty has been destroyed, industry has been stifled, the people's livelihood has been withered, and the international status has been lost. Our people have been running around and appealing for this, and it has not been a matter of a day or two. However, the imperialists harbor wild ambitions and intend to swallow us up. To this day, unequal treaties have not been abolished, and consular jurisdiction is still being held onto and not released. If this continues, how can freedom and equality be realized? How can the suffering of the people be relieved? Their talk of friendship only reveals their cunning, and world peace will never be possible. Representatives, with your foresight, you have long understood that these unequal treaties should be abolished as soon as possible. We hope that you will uphold your grand opinions and express your righteous arguments at the National Assembly, and solemnly resolve to send a letter to the National Government for serious negotiations, vowing not to rest until the goal is achieved. The more than two million people of this city vow to be the backing for the representatives' efforts and the diplomatic support of the Revolutionary Government. The future of the Party and the country truly depends on this. The Shanghai community celebrates the opening of the National Assembly and the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government.</p>

Ms. Soong Ailing, wife of Minister of Industry Kong Xiangxi, performed the bottle-breaking ceremony. When the Minsheng was launched, the sound of firecrackers and colorful paper flew together, creating a magnificent scene. The Navy also sent two planes, Jiang Yan and Jiang Hong, to soar in the sky and distribute leaflets. The ceremony was completed at half past four, and photographs were taken before the audience dispersed. The details of the proceedings and the speeches of the representatives are recorded below (the order is from yesterday's newspaper, omitted).</p>

<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Chen Shaokuan delivered an opening speech, roughly saying that today is the anniversary of the establishment of the National Government, the anniversary of the late Premier's assumption of the office of Extraordinary President, and the lady holding the flowers and performing the bottle-breaking ceremony, Ms. Soong Ailing (photo by this newspaper)</p>
<p>The day of the opening of the event, Minsheng was launched today. Minister Yang was unable to attend because he was attending the National Assembly, so Shaokuan reported on his behalf that the Navy's construction of this warship named Minsheng has great significance. Because the Premier's teachings, the Three Principles of the People, are the three elements of people's livelihood, people's rights, and nationalism. At present, bandits along the river and sea have not been completely suppressed, so the element of people's livelihood cannot be said to be completely at peace. Therefore, our Navy is working hard to carry out the Three Principles of the People. In the past three years, five warships have been built, in the hope that in the future, warships named Minsheng will be used to realize the Three Principles of the People and complete the National Revolution.</p>
<p>Representative's Admonitory Speech: (1) Tong Xingbai, Representative of the Central Department, said in his admonitory speech that in the past three or four years, the Navy has launched four or five new warships one after another. The order of construction is based on practical problems. The main focus is on supporting people's rights, followed by people's livelihood, and finally nationalism, in order to complete the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, when the Minquan warship was launched in previous years, at the time when the Party was facing serious adversity, the naval officers and soldiers participated in the war and made great contributions. The focus was on eliminating the warlords' separatism, completing the unification of the central government, concentrating all political power in the Party, and transitioning from the stage of Party rule through political tutelage to people's rights. This is what the past work has been able to do properly. Now that political tutelage has begun, everything should be devoted to construction. The primary focus of construction is people's livelihood. In terms of building people's livelihood, there are both active and passive meanings, which must be complementary. The active aspect is to engage in material construction, and the passive aspect is to engage in the removal of obstacles. Today, the biggest obstacle to people's livelihood is the rampant banditry, which makes the people's livelihood difficult and construction impossible. The Ministry of the Navy needs this, so its construction work focuses on people's livelihood, and the launching of the Minsheng warship today also shows its symbolism. But considering the name, all naval officers and soldiers will also increase their responsibility due to the launching of the Minsheng warship. It is hoped that they can use this meaning to go all out to eliminate the river and sea bandits, and once the obstacles are removed, construction will be easier. The people will live in peace and the people's livelihood will be prosperous. Then, we will enrich our military preparations, consolidate our national defense, and promote the spirit of nationalism, eliminate the strong powers of aggression, and complete the great work of the Party's Three Principles of the People. Today, Xingbai represents the Central Party Department to participate in the grand ceremony, specifically to provide a reminder of its inherent significance, hoping that the naval officers and soldiers will implement it. (1) Yang Xiaotian, representative of the National Government, said in his admonitory speech that he felt very honored to be sent by order of the Chairman of the National Government to participate in today's grand ceremony of the launching of the Minsheng warship. The navy occupies the most important position in the military preparations of any country. Especially in China, because of its long coastline, national defense must have a huge naval force. However, before the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926), because the warlords competed with each other and the political situation was chaotic, and the science was underdeveloped, and the economy was backward, for various reasons, the naval power of this country could not be brought into play. However, since the establishment of the National Government, our Navy has participated in suppressing internal strife and established unprecedented meritorious service. On the one hand, it has used the spirit of construction to create the Minsheng warship, which adds a special color to the naval force of this country. The entrepreneurial spirit and creative spirit of the naval officers and soldiers are truly worthy of our country's admiration. In the future, we will use the spirit of quelling internal strife to defend against foreign aggression, and use the spirit of creating the Minsheng warship to continue to create countless larger warships so that our country's navy can achieve a first-class position in the international arena, expressing the Party's spirit of construction to the world. This is what we fully expect from the naval officers and soldiers, and it is also what the naval officers and soldiers expect from themselves. (1) Chen Xizeng, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, Representative of the Executive Yuan, delivered an admonitory speech: Today, the Minsheng warship is holding a launching ceremony. Xizeng is ordered by Chiang Kai-shek, the President of the National Government's Executive Yuan, to deliver an admonitory speech. The spirit of the National Revolutionary Army lies in the actual strength of carrying out the late Premier's teachings and working hard on the Three Principles of the People. Recently, the naming of the Navy's warships has been based on this purpose. The Minquan warship and the Minsheng warship are hoping that the naval officers and soldiers will take the name to mean to arouse the spirit of revolution and not forget the teachings of the late Premier's National Revolutionary Party. In the past process of the National Revolution, the naval officers and soldiers also made a lot of efforts and glory, but the responsibility of the future work is more important. The naming of the Minsheng warship is of course to prompt the naval officers and soldiers to pay attention to the Principle of People's Livelihood. The work before the National Revolution was to fight against the warlords and all reactionaries. Now that the country is unified and has entered the period of political tutelage from the military government period, it should strive for construction and pay attention to the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Because the target of the Principle of People's Livelihood is capitalist aggression. The day when the Principle of People's Livelihood is realized is the day when capitalist aggression is eliminated. This is not only the duty that naval officers and soldiers should fulfill, but also the only mission of the National Revolutionary Army and the National Government. It is not only what all members of this party belong to, but also what all nationalities oppressed under the capitalist aggression of the world belong to. I hope that all the members of the Minsheng warship and the naval officers and soldiers will work hard in this direction from today onwards, do not forget the naming of the Minsheng warship, do not forget the hard work of the Navy Department in building new warships, and take the late Premier's intention to implement the Three Principles of the People as a pioneer in quelling chaos and stabilizing danger, so that the people can develop industry and commerce and live and work in peace, promote national prestige and complete the construction of the Navy, and lay the foundation of the country on the safety of the rock. This is also what I want to boast about today when I hold the launching ceremony. (1) Xu Jinyuan, Chief of Staff of the Songhu Garrison Command, Representative of the Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, said in his admonitory speech that the Minsheng warship was launched today, and today is also the opening day of the National Assembly, so it can be said that everyone will have the same permanent impression afterwards. It is necessary to know that the Navy is indispensable for national defense, guaranteeing territorial waters and maintaining national defense. Although there is an army, it will not be successful without the Navy to help and support it. Moreover, the current maritime ban is greatly opened, and even if the countries do not compete with each other in military preparations, they must rely on a strong navy to protect overseas Chinese and develop overseas trade. Therefore, it cannot be said that it is not the era of the Chinese Navy's renaissance that the Navy can continue to build five warships in this economic difficulty. I only hope that from today onwards, we will continue to work hard with the built warships to complete the revolution and achieve the final success. (1) Huang Xuyu, Representative of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, said in his admonitory speech that the Chinese Navy was originally young, but in the past ten years or so, because of the frequent military affairs, it has made a lot of progress as a result. Today, it can actually build as many as five warships itself, which makes me feel fortunate for the future of the Navy. All the navies of a country are intended by the authorities to build ships and train troops for my ability. In fact, the navy is very important to national defense and people's livelihood, so I always hope that one side will work hard on the revolution and the other will be able to lead the people to reach the step of people's livelihood, and the people will also be able to understand the importance of the navy.</p>
<p>Chairman's Reply: Chairman Chen Shaokuan got up to deliver a reply after each representative had given an admonitory speech, saying that he was grateful for the advice and guidance of the representatives and guests, but that the Navy had built warships such as Minquan and Minsheng in the midst of very difficult economic times. Half of the funds were saved from the Navy. For now, let's not talk about what has been completed, but we can give a brief report on what will be and is being planned to be built. (1) A 3,000-ton warship, which is 300 feet wide, is being planned, which is larger than the Yixian. (2) After the warship is completed, we must continue to build it and plan to order a giant warship from abroad. We have set our minds on working hard on the above-mentioned matters, and we will be able to start construction in about three or four months.</p>
<p>Chen Returns to Beijing: After presiding over the launching ceremony of Minsheng, Chen Shaokuan went to Beijing that evening to continue the inspection because the inspection of the warships had not been completed.</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Shanghai County Government Held a Cornerstone Laying Ceremony Yesterday <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Over a Thousand People Braved the Rain to Attend</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government held a cornerstone laying ceremony for the new county seat in Beiqiao Town yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m., coinciding with the day when the late Premier assumed the office of Extraordinary President in Guangzhou and the opening of the National Assembly. In advance, the County Party Department, together with the County Government, took the opportunity to hold a celebration meeting in the town to celebrate and spread the news. At 10:00 a.m., there were dozens of people in attendance, including County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, Director of the Finance Bureau Wang Li, Director of the Construction Bureau Wu Wenhua, Director of the Education Bureau Shi She, Executive Committee members of the County Party Department Jiang Yanchou and Tao Yishan, and local gentry, as well as over a thousand people braving the rain. Committee Member Jiang was elected as chairman. The meeting began at 10:00 a.m. with cannons fired, the flag raised, the Party anthem sung, and a ceremony performed as scheduled. After the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, County Magistrate Yan took the stage to give a speech, roughly saying that today is the anniversary of the late Premier's assumption of the office of Extraordinary President, and it is also the opening of the National Assembly and the cornerstone laying ceremony of the new house of the Shanghai County Government. No matter what position we take, we should recognize that it is a day worth celebrating. Our party members and civil servants should be responsible to the Party and the country for part of the task and the spirit of service should be modeled on the late Premier. Since the separation of Shanghai County and the city, there has long been a proposal to move the county seat, but it has been delayed for more than two years. Now it is gradually turning from theory to reality, and we have chosen such an anniversary to hold the cornerstone laying ceremony of the new house. Shanghai County is really small in China, but we who serve in Shanghai County cannot but see it as very large, and we cannot but regard the politics of Shanghai County as a great cause. Political tutelage and autonomy take the county as the unit. Only when each county is good will the Republic of China be good. Today's cornerstone laying is just the first step. In the future, after the relocation, we will have to cheer up and lay a small foundation for the new China. After the speech, he led the attendees to the new house base on the west side of the Hu-Nan long-distance bus route in the town to perform the cornerstone laying ceremony, adding a layer of mud to the ground and erecting a stone tablet on which was written (The cornerstone laying ceremony for the construction of houses by the Shanghai County Government was held on May 5, 20th year of the Republic of China). After the tablet was erected, County Magistrate Yan took a car back to Shanghai, while the people at the meeting continued to perform various entertainment.</p>
<h3 id="e89">The Chinese Industrial Association telegraphs requesting the resumption of Luan coal transportation <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Factories Have No Coal to Burn</p>
<p>Now Forced to Purchase Japanese Coal with Pain</p>
<p>Japanese Coal is Expensive, Causing Significant Losses</p>
<p>The Dispute Between the Railway and the Mine Needs to Be Resolved Urgently</p>
<p>Since the Bei-Ning Railway Bureau and the Kai-Luan Mining Bureau had a misunderstanding that led to the suspension of coal shipments, Shanghai factories have been unable to find a solution for the lack of fuel coal, forcing them to purchase expensive Japanese coal with great distress. The Chinese Industrial Federation, recognizing this, telegraphed the authorities, earnestly requesting them to order the speedy resumption of transportation. The original telegram reads: "To Chairman Chiang of Nanjing, Deputy Commander Zhang, Vice President of the Executive Yuan Song, Minister of Industry Kong, Minister of Railways Sun: The factories affiliated with our association rely heavily on coal from Kai-Luan. Since the dispute between the Tianjin Kai-Luan Mining Bureau and the Bei-Ning Railway Bureau occurred in mid-March of this year and coal shipments were suspended, it has been more than fifty days. Shanghai is a city of numerous factories, and hundreds of thousands of workers depend on them for their livelihoods. If the factories are forced to shut down due to the lack of fuel coal, causing hundreds of thousands of people to lose their jobs overnight, the harm would be unimaginable. Recently, various factories in Shanghai, unable to obtain coal from Kai-Luan, have reluctantly purchased Japanese coal to maintain operations. However, the cost is extremely high, and buyers are struggling to afford it. In terms of price, Kai-Luan No. 1 slack coal sells for eight taels and three mace of silver per ton, while Fushun No. 1 slack coal sells for more than thirteen taels of silver per ton. Kai-Luan No. 2 slack coal sells for seven taels, seven mace, and five fen of silver per ton, while Fushun No. 2 slack coal sells for around twelve taels and six mace of silver per ton. Comparing the two, Japanese coal is four or five taels more expensive per ton than Kai-Luan coal. Factories that consume a lot of coal use five or six thousand tons per month, while those that consume less still need thousands of tons per month. The magnitude of this loss is truly alarming, and the future of industry is on the verge of collapse. Furthermore, according to reports, Kai-Luan is experiencing difficulties in transporting coal by rail, resulting in a large stockpile of goods in the mines. To remedy this temporarily, each mine has been stopping work for two days each week. Given this situation, the resolution between the railway and the mine remains elusive, and the supply of fuel is unlikely to resume in the short term. In the association's view, there is no reason why the dispute between the two parties cannot be resolved. Whether through mediation, litigation, or arbitration, a fair conclusion will eventually be reached. However, both parties are not seeking a speedy resolution, relying instead on suspension of transportation and reduced production. This allows Japanese merchants to exploit our resources and causes losses to our industry. Who will bear this responsibility? We humbly request that your esteemed (office) (department) order the speedy resumption of transportation and work in the mines. At the same time, the relevant authorities should investigate the points of contention between the two parties and resolve them swiftly to alleviate the distress of the people. This is a sincere plea. We respectfully await your consideration. The Chinese Industrial Federation bows in respect."</p>

<p>Japanese Deputy Envoy Shigemitsu Aoi, accompanied by Secretaries Horiuchi and Hayashi, took the night train to Nanjing at 11:45 PM last night to meet with Foreign Minister Wang and continue discussions on the Sino-Japanese legal rights issue.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Japanese Government's Scope of Negotiations on Legal Rights in China <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Comprises a Total of Seven Items</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reports that after Deputy Envoy Shigemitsu returned to Japan and reported everything to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry, after careful consideration, broadly agreed on the following scope for Sino-Japanese legal rights negotiations: (1) Regarding the issue of permissibly revoking legal rights, the Japanese government does not object to formal negotiations with the government of the Republic of China, but only to the extent that Japan will enjoy the same privileges, rights, exemptions, or benefits as other related countries. (2) The abolition of consular jurisdiction, whether phased or not, may have adverse consequences for the traditional and cultural relationship between China and Japan. In order to avoid such consequences, Japan is only willing to abolish jurisdiction over civil cases first, as stipulated below, but only after China has implemented new civil laws based on modern judicial concepts and their judicial effectiveness has been recognized as satisfactory by Japan. (3) Regardless of how the jurisdiction over civil cases is decided, Japan will not allow any changes to the current status of the Kwantung Leased Territory, the South Manchurian Railway Zone, and other similar spheres of influence. (4) If civil jurisdiction is abolished, all Japanese residents throughout China should enjoy permanent, complete, and unrestricted rights throughout China, and the Chinese government must accept full responsibility for guaranteeing the welfare of Japanese residents. (5) Japan will consider whether it can agree to abolish criminal jurisdiction in the same way depending on the circumstances after civil jurisdiction is abolished under the aforementioned conditions. (6) However, during the initial negotiations on the abolition of civil jurisdiction, there must be an understanding that foreign nationals must be employed in all Chinese courts for a certain period of time and have the same powers as Chinese judges to jointly hear cases, until the end of this period is agreed upon later. (7) In any case, Japan should enjoy the same treatment as other related countries.</p>

<p>A Telegram Received by the Chinese Branch</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Chinese branch of the International Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from Washington yesterday stating that the 6th Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce opened in Washington D.C. on the morning of May 4th to 9th. The Congress is held once every two years, and this time representatives from 46 countries attended. After the opening, US President Hoover delivered a welcome speech, urging representatives of all countries to request their governments to disarm, because under the current situation, the expenses of all countries on military affairs amount to about 50 billion US dollars, which is a major reason for the lack of progress in the world economy. The former President of the International Chamber of Commerce (former Prime Minister of Belgium) Mr. [missing name] delivered a speech stating that he advocated that all countries should reduce tariffs as soon as possible, and that the large-scale sale of cheap products by Soviet Russia to various countries is particularly detrimental to the current sluggish world market. The chairman of this Congress is [missing name] (a well-known Chicago lawyer and current president of the American branch of the International Chamber of Commerce). Many issues were discussed during the meeting, the more important of which were: (1) the silver price issue, (2) the tariff issue of various countries, (3) the economic relationship with Russia, and (4) the war debt issue of European and American countries. It is also heard that the term of office of the former President of the International Chamber of Commerce, Mr. [missing name], has expired, and the result of the re-election in Washington was Dr. Mentlersohn of Germany.</p>

<p>According to a letter from the Beiping Printing Bureau, clarifying the matter of ordering postage stamps from British merchants, it states that according to the contract provisions copied and indicated by the Postal Department, 150 million postage stamps are to be printed annually by British merchants for a term of five years, but can be extended to six to ten years, not a fixed five-year period. Regarding the printing price, it is in accordance with the contract of the British De La Rue Company, which is US$164.95 per million stamps. As for the reason why the Ministry entered into a contract with the British side, it was not due to poor plate molds. The portrait of Chairman Chiang, which the Bureau previously received for engraving, was a photo taken several years ago and did not yet have a beard, and the deadline was extremely tight, so the engravers were not entirely to blame.</p>

<p>Requesting Remedial Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Knitting Industry Association, Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Association, and Towel Industry Association yesterday sent a letter to the Unified Tax Bureau stating that since the actual collection of the unified tax on cotton yarn, simple weaving factories have been suffering from the complicated procedures of exchanging certificates and obtaining licenses, which has sometimes delayed shipping schedules and caused business losses. Representatives of various associations have repeatedly explained this to your Bureau and requested that you devise remedial measures. Since our associations have similar businesses, we held a joint meeting on the 29th of last month to gather opinions and make a comprehensive request to your Bureau. The results of the meeting are recorded and presented as follows: (1) We request that your Bureau immediately implement the proposed eight articles on the methods for simple weaving factories to produce cotton yarn directly into cotton yarn woven products using taxed cotton yarn and cancel the redundant procedures of exchanging tax-paid certificates or their transfer certificates for factory entry certificates. The blank transfer certificates issued with the tax bureau's seal should be collected by the various trade associations, and the unified tax bureau should instruct one or two staff members to be stationed at each trade association to verify and affix a re-verification seal to facilitate transportation and sales. (2) The tax refund methods for directly woven products transported to areas where the unified tax has not been implemented or exported overseas should be handled in accordance with the established tax refund methods stipulated by the Jianghai Customs (please consult the Customs Administration or the Tax Department for details) or allow the trade associations to collect the tax refund vouchers of their affiliated factories and collect the tax due from the unified tax bureau before distributing it to the factories. (3) Please add columns on the transfer certificate for (cotton yarn count), (name of the original yarn factory), (month), (because the tax on thread spun from 60 count or higher cotton yarn varies monthly according to market prices), and (tax refund due) to be filled in one by one as a basis for tax refunds. The above three points are what our trade hopes to see implemented soon. We respectfully request that your Bureau consider the suffering of merchants and implement these measures.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The National Goods Maintenance Association Asks Chinese People to Pay Attention to the Declaration of Foreign Merchants Establishing Factories in China <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association is paying close attention to the matter of foreign merchants establishing factories in China. On the 20th of last month, it convened a joint meeting of representatives of national goods factories from various industries, and the details were reported in the newspapers. Yesterday, Standing Committee members Wang Jiean and Wang Xingyi specially instructed the secretariat to draft a declaration to make it clear to compatriots across the country that the economic invasion of China by foreigners is the truth. The original text is recorded below: Compatriots across the country are aware that our country's national goods industry and commerce have long been under the economic invasion and oppression of imperialism, resulting in a weak country and impoverished people who have fallen into a semi-colonial status. Since the national government unified the country and worked hard to govern, all kinds of shackles that harmed the national economy and people's livelihood in the past will be strived to be removed. The sun and moon will shine again to restore the glory of our Chinese nation. As the unequal treaties continue to be revised, the tariff autonomy is recovered, the consular jurisdiction is gradually abolished, and the extraterritorial rights are about to be recovered, we are deeply pleased. Unexpectedly, it has recently been reported that Japan and other countries believe that after China's tariff autonomy, the weapon of political unity to resist the invasion of foreign goods can be enriched, and the national goods industry and commerce can have the hope of prosperity. Therefore, a new invasion strategy has emerged, that is, changing the export of goods to the export of capital, and expanding Japanese enterprises in China as much as possible. They want to move as many factories as possible from Tokyo, Osaka, and other places to Shanghai to avoid the impact of China's protective tariffs. Therefore, they are carrying huge sums of money to set up factories in China, and all kinds of daily necessities in our country are being planned and carried out. They are promoting the establishment of factories to engage in manufacturing. They are also transporting male and female Japanese workers to China to work to kill our Chinese workers. If such a major event that harms our country is allowed to enter our country and set up factories, not only will they become the hosts instead of the guests, but they will also pose a great threat and oppression to our country's industry and commerce. Therefore, we should urgently gather our strength and rise up together to resist it. We must achieve the goal of strict restrictions to prevent imitation and protect the foundation of the country. In addition to sending a special telegram to the National Government and ministries on April 6 this year, requesting them to pay close attention and find ways to prevent this, the association also convened a special joint conference of representatives of national goods factories from various industries on April 20. After research, the following points were decided: A. Requests to the government: (1) Establish special regulations for foreign nationals setting up factories in China, registering, and issuing licenses, and order local government offices to strictly prevent them. (2) For existing foreign-owned factories, order them to register in accordance with the law and levy heavy taxes, such as business tax and dumping tax. (3) Urgently restrict factories that have not been established from being established again. (4) Notify the governments of various countries to instruct merchants of various countries to mark the nationality, product name, trademark, etc. on the goods they sell to China, and not to imitate famous brands to avoid mixing inferior goods with good ones. (5) Urgently negotiate with various countries to instruct merchants of those countries not to transfer workers from those countries to China to avoid hindering the livelihoods of Chinese workers. (6) Encourage domestic industrial manufacturing. (7) Reduce or exempt taxes on national goods. (8) Encourage foreign trade in national goods. B. Please note for national goods industry: (1) Be sure to mark the words "Chinese Merchant" and the factory name, trademark, location, etc. on national goods products. (2) Jointly raise the basic industries. C. Please note for compatriots: (1) Respect the orders of the National Government and implement the promotion of using national goods. Foreign goods should not be used if our country has products of the same kind. (2) Do not sell land or factory bases to foreigners. (3) Chinese merchants must not covet short-term gains and come forward on behalf of foreigners when foreigners come to China to set up factories. The above points are all urgent and essential fundamental measures that must be implemented. In addition to implementing the plan in accordance with the resolution, the association hereby declares earnestly, earnestly requesting compatriots across the country to rise up together and cooperate with one heart to resist this new economic invasion, the tide of national destruction, and maintain the foundation of our Chinese nation. The timing is extremely urgent, and if there is even a slight hesitation, a tragic disaster will appear.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Qian Chaofu of Yongfeng Lumber Company Kidnapped <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Two Kidnappers Were Exceptionally Cunning</p>
<p>Detectives Were Tricked Twice</p>
<p>The Truth Was Revealed on the Third Time</p>
<p>The Hostage Suffered Greatly in the Bandit's Den</p>
<p>Qian Chaofu, an employee of the Yongfeng Lumber Company in Lujiabang, Bund, Nanshi, and a native of Anting, was kidnapped along with his car No. 1797 (City No. 1993) at 0:15 in the morning of the 15th of last month from his concubine Yue'e's residence at No. 27 Hehefang, Xiafei Road, French Concession, when his car arrived at the corner of Pushi Road and Saposai Road. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, it is reported that Qian was rescued from danger by the French Concession Police yesterday, and four bandits were arrested. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiations Scheduled, Qian's family was panicked when they heard the news on the day Qian was kidnapped. At the same time, the French Concession Police sent out detectives, hoping to solve the case in the shortest possible time. But the bandits were very cunning and cunning, sending a total of three letters to Qian's house. The first letter demanded more than ten thousand dollars. The family did not reply because the ransom was too high. A few days later, they received a second letter, scheduling a meeting at Room 420 on the fourth floor of the Central Hotel at the intersection of Hubei Road and Guangdong Road in the Public Concession. Qian's family sent someone on time.</p>
<p>Demanded 30,000 Yuan, Arrived at 420, But There Was No One in the Room. According to the waiter, the guest in Room 402 had gone out and asked them to wait if anyone came to visit. The person in charge of Qian's family sat quietly and waited for a long time. Suddenly, a phone call came, and the person in charge was contacted. The bandits said that the minimum amount was 30,000 yuan. The two sides negotiated repeatedly, but there was no result, and they dispersed.</p>
<p>Detectives in Disguise After this negotiation failed to reach an agreement, the news disappeared. It was not until the 1st of this month that Qian's family received a third letter, scheduling a meeting near Daxilu Road in Huxi at 3:00 PM on the 3rd, and the person sent must hold a wine bottle as a sign. Qian's family could not bear it any longer and reported the three letters to the French Concession Police. Chief Detective Bardi, supervised by Chief Cai Jinjiu, Detective Li Yaolong, Deputy Detective Qian Yumin, Zhang Ziying, Mao Jingen, and detectives Qin Youyu and others, disguised themselves as various peddlers and secretly waited nearby. Two bandits were arrested. The person in charge of Qian's family walked to Daxilu Road at the scheduled time, holding a wine bottle on the sidewalk. At the same time, disguised detectives had already been ambushed. At about 3:00 PM, two people, one in a Zhongshan suit and one in a long serge robe, came from the east. The two walked and talked, and their attitude was natural. They first paid attention to the surroundings for a week, then walked past the person in charge and went straight west. After a while, they turned back and asked the person in charge. Before they could say a few words, the ambush soldiers came out from all sides, and the two bandits surrendered.</p>
<p>The Hostage in Chuansha, after the two bandits were brought to the police station, the one in the Zhongshan suit confessed his name as Gu Defu, and the one in the long serge robe confessed his name as Lu Andiang. They said that the hostage was now hidden in a rural area more than 50 miles away from Chuansha. They immediately stated the route. Detective Bardi of the Brazilian police supervised the entire team of detectives and took a ferry across the river at about 6:00 PM that night. They walked all night to Chuansha. The moonlight was dim, and the road was rugged and difficult to distinguish. When they arrived at their destination, they searched almost everywhere, but there was no trace.</p>
<p>Rushing to Minhang, the detectives trekked until night, disappointed and returned. They interrogated the two bandits severely again. Unexpectedly, the two bandits were very cunning and falsely confessed for the second time that the hostage was hidden in Ruoqiao, Minhang. The detectives believed it to be true and went to Minhang again without stopping. They were still frustrated and returned to Shanghai. The detectives hated the bandits to the bone. After the third interrogation, the two bandits confessed the real address. The hostage was actually hidden in a flat upstairs building far away from the police station in Saposai Road.</p>
<p>The hostage was rescued early in the morning yesterday. Chief Detective Ba, supervised by the detectives, took the two bandits to the location they confessed and identified the house. The detectives rushed in and went straight to the loft, rescuing the hostage Qian Chaofu. There were still two bandits guarding him. They jumped out of the loft window and tried to escape, but were intercepted by the detectives and taken to the police station. One confessed his name as Gu Er and the other as Lu Er. Then, the hostage recounted the suffering he had endured in the bandit's den. The detectives then escorted him home. When Chief Inspector Fei heard the news, he immediately praised the detectives for their hard work day and night in successfully solving the case to encourage them.</p>

<h3 id="e101">A Young Woman from Fenghua Accuses Her Husband of Indecent Behavior with Her Sister-in-Law <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Requesting Mediation to Divorce Her Husband</p>
<p>Lin Chen, a young woman from Fenghua, Zhejiang (named A Xiu), has hired someone to draft a document requesting mediation from the mediation office of the local court to divorce her husband Lin Kangxing. The statement states that the defendant seduced her sister-in-law to elope, and the plaintiff was brutally abused and abandoned. The plaintiff was married to the defendant through her parents and matchmakers without her consent, making a big mistake. She got married on the 4th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar in the 14th year of the Republic of China at the age of seventeen. At first, they were safe and sound, but the defendant never had a career and made friends imprudently, specializing in wandering around. He refused to listen to her bitter persuasion. The plaintiff's parents repeatedly interceded and provided financial assistance, but the defendant's character was low and it was difficult to achieve success. They had two children successively. The defendant's brother Lin Ningxing (49 years old) lost his job due to his age, and his wife Lin Yang (32 years old) was naturally charming and young. They dared to commit adultery with the defendant's sister-in-law. They lived together like husband and wife and gradually stole the plaintiff's clothes and jewelry (worth more than 300 yuan) and pawned them. If she slightly disobeyed their intentions, she would be beaten and abused, suffering greatly. The defendant did not care about the lives of the plaintiff and her three children. They were cold and hungry and suffered unspeakably. In April of last year, after the plaintiff's mother heard about it, she personally brought the plaintiff and her children to Shanghai. In May, she went to the cigarette factory to work for a living, and her two children were fostered in Shanghai. On December 14th of last year, Lin Ningxing sued his wife Yang and his brother (the defendant) in the Fenghua County Government for adultery. The defendant, fearing punishment, seduced Yang to elope to Shanghai on December 16th. Lin Ningxing then exhausted the possessions of the plaintiff in her husband's house and tracked them down to Shanghai. After mediation, the brothers reconciled and lived together with one wife, taking turns committing adultery. The plaintiff inquired in every possible way and learned about the situation. On April 18th of this year, she went to Zhabei with her mother Chen Ying to negotiate. The defendant and Yang were evasive, but Lin Ningxing relied on his brutality and committed violence. He was arrested by the Second Branch of the Fifth District. It was ordered that Lin Ningxing hand over the defendant before the 21st of that month. The plaintiff was abused and abandoned by the defendant, suffering unspeakably. The defendant and her sister-in-law committed adultery, injuring the atmosphere and violating ethics, acting like animals. They abandoned his wife and committed adultery with his sister-in-law, destroying morality. The marriage was broken and it was difficult to live together. She should prepare a document to the Second Branch of the Fifth District to file the case and the Fenghua County Government to investigate and provide evidence to mediate the divorce to maintain women's rights. Yesterday, Judge Chen Bingxin opened a court hearing. The plaintiff Lin Chen stated the previous situation and requested permission to divorce. The official said that the defendant was not present and there was no way to mediate. He will issue further instructions later.</p>

<p>Zhang Qixiang Won the Shanxi Cup</p>
<p>Xu Ziqian Worked Hard</p>
<p>Every year at the end of April, the Chinese team of the International Business Group will announce the service achievements of each member to see the level of shooting skills and whether they are fully attended, and rewards will be determined. According to the team's regulations, those team members who have full attendance throughout the year and whose shooting total score in the qualified military training course is better than others, the team will present a Shanxi Cup with the name engraved on it to show encouragement for one year. Another small silver cup will be replaced and given to other members. If the member still has full attendance and perfect performance in the next session, they can win it continuously. It is heard that the shooting performance of the team this year is excellent. Zhang Qixiang, the corporal, and team member Xu Ziqian, who did not miss a single day of class, both had full attendance throughout the year. The total shooting score was 151 points for both of them. However, Zhang shot 34 points in the final siege shooting of the military training course, and Xu shot 31 points. Therefore, the cup was awarded to Zhang Qixiang because of this difference. Zhang is an employee of HSBC Bank on the Bund and uses the space in the morning and evening to serve the business group all year round, regardless of cold or heat, wind or rain. It is appropriate for him to have this outstanding achievement. As for Xu Ziqian, he is a junior team member who can reach a high level of shooting skills and does not miss a day. It cannot be said that he has not worked hard.</p>

<p>Special Representative Returns to China to Solicit Samples</p>
<p>When the Singapore Great World was being built last year, the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation's Nanyang Islands inspection group considered it necessary to establish a National Products Exhibition Hall there. Thereupon, Li Chunrong and others suggested that this matter was a patriotic duty that could not be shirked. They immediately convened a shareholders' meeting and resolved to allocate a portion of the Great World amusement park for use as a National Products Exhibition Hall. It has now been learned that the hall has been completed and the staff have been hired. It is scheduled to open on June 1st. A special representative, Mr. Fan Wenqin, has returned to China to solicit samples from various domestic national products factories. The contact address is temporarily located within the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The solicitation methods are as follows: (1) The samples solicited for this exhibition are limited to those manufactured in this country. (2) The samples solicited are tentatively divided into eight categories: textiles, clothing, food, daily necessities, education, hygiene, electrical machinery, and miscellaneous handicrafts. (3) Samples of all categories that are suitable for sale in the Nanyang Islands are especially welcome. (4) If the samples are of high value or too bulky to be easily transported, drawings may be used instead. (5) All samples solicited by this exhibition hall will be entrusted to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for packing and mailing. However, if the samples are glass or porcelain and are easily damaged, the producers are requested to pack the samples themselves before sending them to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. (6) Please indicate the name of each sample and the manufacturer's location and factory. It is also hoped that a price list and multiple copies of advertising leaflets will be included to assist in publicity and promotion. (7) All solicited samples will be sent in batches. The first batch is scheduled for May 15th, and the second batch is scheduled for the end of May. It is best to send them by the first batch in order to be included in the opening exhibition. (8) All items sent for display will be publicized by this hall free of charge. (9) If any factory has newly invented products, they may be sent to the exhibition at any time. (10) All displayed samples will be promoted by the Singapore Nanyang National Products Company in addition to publicity (Publicity Methods) (1) An advertising steamboat will run daily along the riverbank of the Great World, directly to the harbor, to attract attention. (3) Specially decorated automobiles will be prepared in the city to send people to give lectures. (4) A national products column will be specially opened in the Great World monthly magazine to promote national products. (5) Personnel who are proficient in various dialects will be specially dispatched to various ports in the Nanyang Islands to give lectures and promote sales.

<p>Accused Rickshaw Pullers of Stealing It</p>
<p>The night before, American naval soldiers Gepo Sheng and Laixi were drinking in bars in the French Concession until midnight. They hired rickshaws pulled by Chen Da's ninth son and Wang Xiao's fourth son and ordered them to go to the prostitute's quarters on Bazilu for carousing. When they arrived at the Dexingli brothel, the two soldiers got out of the rickshaws to take out money. At this time, Gepo Sheng suddenly showed a surprised expression and said that 50 gold coins were missing from his pocket. He then accused the two rickshaw pullers of stealing them while they were drunk. The rickshaw pullers denied it, and a quarrel ensued. The police arrived after hearing the alarm and took the two rickshaw pullers and a Cantonese man, Huang Han Chenzhi, who was watching and suspected of being involved, to the police station together. The next morning, they were sent to the Special District Local Court for interrogation. The two sides held their own views, and no clues could be found.

The other day, Detective Deng Hailin patrolled Fuzhou Road and, according to an informant, identified a Ningbo man, Xu A'gen, who was wandering on the left side of the road as a robber. He was immediately arrested and investigated. It was learned that Shen's property was stolen by the bandit in collusion with Chen A'fa and Shao Sanbao. Only one diamond ring was found on his body.

<p>A Wicked Husband and a Fierce Wife Gathered in One Family</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau of Qibao Town, Songyi, Shanghai West, discovered a young woman in the Puhuitang Port in the west of the town the day before yesterday afternoon. She was rescued from the river and resuscitated using artificial respiration. When asked about the reason for her suicide attempt, she said that her father's name was Zhu Fugeng, who lived in Zhujiazhai, north of Xinzhuang. Her name was Xinzhen, and she was 27 years old. In the spring of the 13th year of the Republic of China, she married Cai Mao'nan of Meilong Town through a matchmaker. After she married, the couple was still harmonious and had two sons, the eldest Jide, who was seven years old, and the younger Shangde, who was four years old. Her aunt, Zhang, was very fierce. Although she was over the age of knowing her fate, she was still coquettish, so her ugly name spread far and wide. She advised her with kind words because her face was at stake. Who knew that loyal words were unpleasant to the ear and angered her vicious aunt. From then on, disagreements arose between the family from time to time, and when there was a disagreement, whipping followed. Her husband, Mao Nan, was addicted to morphine injections, and even beat her arbitrarily, and her skin was covered with scars. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, he was criminally prosecuted in the local procuratorate. Later, he took his children back to Ningbo for treatment. In the summer of the 18th year, he was persuaded to return and live together by the clan chief. He originally hoped that his conscience would return and that he would correct his mistakes, but after a few days, he was rejected by Cai's mother and son. She had no choice but to return to her mother's house, and it had been two years now. She thought her life was miserable and could only sob and swallow her voice, but the future was bleak, and the lives of her two sons and herself would be impossible to maintain. When she spoke, she was weeping and crying. Patrol Chief Luo sympathized with her plight and temporarily lent her clothes to change into. On the one hand, he notified her family to come to the police station to take her back to avoid any more accidents.</p>

<p>Involved in a Lawsuit Pending Judgment</p>
<p>Korean Chen Anli was passing through the French Concession on Xiahui Road last month when he was knocked down by a tram driven by Shen Asi, a driver of the French Tram Company. The patrolmen arrived and sent Chen to the hospital for treatment, but he had not yet recovered. Yesterday, the police brought all the people involved to the French Concession Hall for questioning. The plaintiff, Chen Anli, was represented by his wife, who hired lawyer Pulaymei, who claimed that the case had been certified by a notary public that the tram driven by the defendant was driving very fast and that its brakes were damaged. Therefore, there was a risk of causing an accident. Since there are many pedestrians on the roads in Shanghai, the defendant tram company should not have driven the damaged tram on the road. The responsibility should be borne by the defendant company. In addition to requesting an investigation according to law, he also filed a private lawsuit to recover the losses. The defendant was represented by lawyer Bahe, who claimed that the defendant company had full-time car repair workers who repaired the vehicles as soon as they were damaged. There was no reason to drive the damaged car on the road. It should be known that the situation on the day of the accident was that the plaintiff was not careful and rushed out from the side road, causing him to be hit. Moreover, there was a traffic control patrolman at the place with a red light signal. Pedestrians and vehicles should have paid attention. The plaintiff was completely to blame and requested a clear investigation. The Chinese and Western officials ordered a consultation and the court would announce the judgment.</p>

The preliminary trial sentenced the defendants to be innocent. Qianxin was not satisfied and filed an appeal represented by lawyer Lin. The other day, the joint court of the Special Court concluded the trial and announced the judgment, overturning the original judgment and sentencing Chen Zhengcai to three months of imprisonment for the crime of forging a registered trademark with the intention of deceiving others. Lao Yinsheng and Chen Xianfang knew that the goods were counterfeited trademarks and sold them, and were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment, all with a two-year reprieve.

<p>The China Soap Company's main factory on Yangshupu Road, Shanghai East, was built in the 13th year of the Republic of China and expanded in the 18th year. The land it occupies is as large as 150 acres. Facing the Huangpu River, it can easily import approximately 15,000 to 20,000 tons of raw materials each year through this port, which is very advantageous in terms of location. The factory is operated by a British merchant, Mr. Jones, who is the general manager. He is a man of rich experience in the business world. The management within the factory is methodical and well-organized. To the outside world, it adheres to the principle of small profits but quick turnover, so its business is developing day by day. Now, a new soap factory has been added, specially for the manufacture of Lux soap. Merchants and journalists from this city and other cities were specially invited to visit. Mr. Jones, the foreign general manager, and Mr. He Bo, the factory director, led the tour. The factory is large in scale and uses the latest machinery to replace labor, so it can produce 1.5 million boxes of soap each year, and only 300 workers are needed to cope. There are a total of 26 soap pots in the factory, including 20 large pots, each of which can cook 50 tons of soap, and the rest of the small pots, each of which can cook 25 tons. There are ten steam furnaces in the steam room, which burn about 50 to 60 tons of coal every day. The steam required by each cooking pot is supplied by this furnace. There are also printing machines, wooden box nailing machines, and printing machines that can print five sets of colors at the same time. The equipment is complete and is second to none in Shanghai. The soaps currently produced are Lihua Sunlight Soap, Health Medicinal Soap, Lux Soap, Lihua Soap Powder, Xiangmao, Beiji, and Hexing Umbrella brand, etc., especially Sunlight, Xiangmao, and Beiji, which are the best-selling. The main ingredients of the raw materials purchased by the factory, such as vegetable oil and grease oil, are mostly from our country, and the office staff, engineers, chemists, and workers employed are all Chinese. The products produced by the Chinese using our country's raw materials under the supervision of the Chinese are national products. It is said that the treatment of employees and workers is also very good. The company has always adhered to the principle of continuous improvement, so every ton of raw materials purchased is chemically tested, and every box of soap produced is also chemically tested to ensure perfection. Such a large-scale factory, coupled with the spirit of continuous reform and progress, the future development is limitless.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Housing Dispute in Shangyifang <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Return of Notice to Second Sub-Lessee</p>
<p>The Shangyifang houses (formerly the site of Xishou Anli) newly built in the French Concession Baxianqiao have been completed for a month. At first, the tenants hoped that the market would prosper and business would be booming. However, after opening for many days, business has not progressed at all. The tenants believe that the future is long, and in such a bleak situation, not only will they not be able to stand firm in the future, but it will also be difficult to maintain the status quo. Therefore, they agreed to organize the Shangyifang Tenants' Union, hiring lawyer Jin Yu to publish advertisements in newspapers, recommending seven responsible representatives and three economic committee members, and sending letters to various groups requesting assistance, all on file. After the establishment of the Tenants' Union, the sub-lessee, Shangyi Company, learned the news and transferred the management rights to the China Business Company. Yesterday, the China Business Company notified the tenants, stating the details of the takeover. The tenants, because they are now requesting a rent reduction from Shangyi Company, decided that all notices from the second party should be rejected until the negotiations are settled. After a meeting, the tenants collected the aforementioned notices and went to lawyer Jin's office to request a letter to be returned to the China Business Company. Lawyer Jin prepared a letter and returned it. Since the tenants organized the Tenants' Union, they have filmed the regulations for cracking down on sub-leasing issued by the former French Consul General Wei Lide (now the Minister to China) into Chinese and Western films, and printed various statistics on the small rent of the neighborhood housing, the interest rate table of the Shangyi Company's rent collection, and the neighborhood housing fund survey table for reference during negotiations.</p>

<p>The Pacific Bicycle Shop at 600 Gongguan Road, French Concession, suddenly caught fire at 2:40 yesterday morning. It quickly spread and could not be contained. The French Concession Fire Brigade rushed to the scene after hearing the news and extinguished the fire after an hour.

<p>The Truth Is Unknown</p>
<p>A local man, Yan Ji Yu, about 31 or 32 years old, checked into the Shenjiang Hotel on Sanma Road alone the night before. He paid the room fee at the time and went out once, returning to his residence at about 9 o'clock to sleep. By noon the next day, he had not yet gotten up. The waiter entered the room to check and saw that Yan was unconscious and unresponsive. There was only an empty opium box left next to his pillow and a suicide note. It was immediately reported to the police and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective and he died after a while. The police sent a car to the morgue for an autopsy and took all the suicide notes to the police station for safekeeping.</p>

<p>Chemical expert Wu Yun Chu, in view of the fact that basic industrial raw materials such as acids, alkalis, and bleaching powder are all controlled by the British and Japanese, gathered comrades to establish the Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant on Bailinan Road, Shanghai West, using the latest electrolytic method to manufacture hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, and bleaching powder, etc., which is the pioneer of electrical chemistry in our country. Its products, such as the purity of hydrochloric acid, absolutely do not contain impurities such as sulfur, etc., are the most valuable raw materials for food manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, refining, and silkworm breeding improvement. Caustic soda is used by local factories in this city, so in addition to supplying solid forms for foreign needs, liquid solutions are transported. The test certificates of the Central Industrial Testing Institute, the China Industrial Chemistry Research Institute, the Shanghai Special Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Industrial Goods Testing Institute, and the Shanghai Chemical Testing Room can be used as evidence. Since the shipment, buyers have flocked to the company from Hong Kong and Guangdong in the south to Liaoning in the north. There is a trend of demand exceeding supply, and on the one hand, mechanical equipment is being added and factory buildings are being expanded. In addition to the original factory director Shen Yizhu and general engineer Bai Nuya, Yu Xueyang has been hired as an engineer to preside over general affairs. Mr. Yu graduated from the graduate school of the University of Michigan in the United States with a master's degree and served as a chemist in the Aohai River Paper Mill in the United States and the director of the research department of the Wuzhou Guben Soap and Pharmaceutical Factory for many years after returning to China. He has rich experience and learning. The year before last, he served as a representative of the Chinese Engineering Society to attend the International Industrial Conference in Tokyo. Last year, he returned from Japan and was invited by the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University, but he did not take the position and was willing to devote himself to the lifeblood of China's emerging basic industry, so the future development can be celebrated even more for Tianyuan.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Declared Liquidation After a Big Sale <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Yuanchangxiang and Yongchangxiang Bankrupt</p>
<p>Yuanchangxiang and Yongchangxiang department stores, located at the west end of Shengliping Alley on Gongguan Road, French Concession, were founded by Zhu Caiyuan and have been around for several years. Last year, when the Yongchangxiang store site was subleased to Meifeng to open a silk satin shop, the store was merged into Yongyuanxiang in Shengliping Alley. Now, because Meifeng Silk Bureau is expanding its plan and moving Meifeng to the west end of Yuqingli, the house has been returned to the sub-lessor, so Zhu Caiyuan redecorated the vacant house, tied up lights, and relaunched Yongchangxiang, and posted slogans commemorating the fifth anniversary of the big sale, and tied up the drama of the iron bow chicken on the gate tower of the store gate. The tied up paper and silk figures are automatically wired to attract the attention of passers-by. This is to attract customers, so business has been quite good for several days. It is said that Zhu used the revolving funds for speculation and failed, and hired accountants Pan Qibang and Wu Zheng and lawyer Fei Xizhen to draw up a joint notice. Yesterday morning, the two stores suddenly went bankrupt at the same time. A liquidation notice was posted on the door, limiting creditors to open their debts within 14 days and send them to the two accountants Pan and Wu for presentation to the public office for review and handling. The creditors received this news, saying that Zhu Caiyuan used the name of the new opening as a big sale, collected the existing funds from the inventory, and then disappeared and did not meet them. The creditors all gathered at the store at about 11:00 am to discuss the countermeasures. Because the creditors have not yet gathered, it was decided to hold a general meeting of creditors today before discussing the repayment measures. However, the amount of debt has not yet been ascertained.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Silk Cocoon Association Petitioned the Government to Protect Cocoon Merchants <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Huang Chen of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Silk Cocoon General Office Committee presented a document to the National Government yesterday, saying that the purpose of the presentation was to protect the cocoon market, prepare in advance, refer to the methods of previous years' petitions, and respectfully ask the government to review and approve the distribution of orders to the provincial governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to strictly protect the cocoon-producing areas to ensure the safety of farmers and merchants. Because the cocoon production in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui varies due to different times and geographical conditions, the cocoon market in each county opens at different times around the Lesser Fullness solar term. Ningbo and Shaoxing in Zhejiang are especially early. Over the years, the General Office has proposed and petitioned the three provincial governments to transfer orders for protection and print protection methods and present them to the military, county government, and public security bureaus in various places for reference and handling, so that the protection can be thorough and everyone is deeply grateful. This year's cocoon market has arrived, and the social situation is still peaceful. However, the brigands in various rural areas have not been put down, and the cocoon-producing areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are all located in waterways for transportation. During the cocoon season, silver and goods are exchanged. Without sending troops to patrol and protect along the way, it is not enough to prevent unforeseen events. As for Anhui Province, the journey is farther and the local security is not comparable to that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The protection of each cocoon-producing area is even more important. Most of the cocoon merchants in each province are located in rural towns, and the protection force is not as strong as that of cities. The safety of farmers carrying cocoons to the merchants and cocoon merchants carrying banknotes to the merchants to collect cocoons is of great importance. The routes passed or the locations of the firms must have the strength to maintain order so that fear can be avoided and incidents can be quelled. The General Office's responsibility lies in preparing for the worst and noting the matters that should be protected, such as the loading and transportation of silver dollars and the transportation of dry cocoons, with reference to the usual situation, noting the date in each article, and respectfully requesting the government to preside over the handling and distribute orders to the three provincial governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui before the deadline to quickly order the stationed troops and the governments of various counties and the water and land public security bureaus to protect them in accordance with the regulations and implement them in an integrated manner, and the General Office will present copies of the methods and articles to the three provincial governments for distribution to the cocoon-producing areas for reference and handling, and all matters related to the early petition for protection of the cocoon market are attached with the methods for review and filing by the government and for separate implementation and begging for the command to comply with the above for the sake of public convenience, and respectfully presenting them to the National Government (the articles on protecting the cocoon market are omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e122">Shanghai Silk Reeling Industry Union Petitioned for Mediation <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Discounted Wages Are Only Heard of in the National Industry</p>
<p>Silk Prices Have Risen but Wages Have Not Been Restored to Original Levels</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yinxiang District and Zhabei District Second Silk Reeling Industry Union has repeatedly requested the factory to restore the original wages in order to maintain a livelihood because life is becoming more difficult and silk prices have risen, but the factory has not responded. Yesterday, it jointly petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. The content of its petition is as follows: (1) Number of workers related to the dispute: 9,000 female workers, 900 male workers, and 3,500 child workers in the Fourth District (i.e., Yinxiang District); 30,000 female workers, 2,700 male workers, and 15,000 child workers in the Sixth District (i.e., Zhabei District). (2) The main point of the dispute is to request the guild to notify each factory to restore all wages for male and female workers to the original amount starting from May 1st (Reason) In November last year, the silk reeling industry workers, in order to forgive the factory's difficult business, adopted the principle of mutual assistance and understanding between labor and capital to seek industrial development, and did not hesitate to sacrifice pain to temporarily calculate wages at 85% of the original amount. Since the wage reduction, gold prices have continued to rise and prices have skyrocketed. The cost of living has continued to increase. To this day, the wages of workers who work hard all day long not only cannot take care of a family, but also cannot afford their own basic food and clothing. If this continues, the workers will be waiting to die. Moreover, now that silk prices have risen compared to last winter, reaching more than 1,000 taels in February this year, the factory has not automatically restored wages at this time, ignoring the suffering of the workers. The urgency of the workers is as described above. The restoration of the original wage amount is really urgent to temporarily extend the lives of these tens of thousands of workers. Moreover, the wage reduction was originally temporary and has now been half a year, so it cannot be said to be temporary. Moreover, wage reduction is not only rare in all industries in Shanghai, but also only heard of in all industries in the country. Under these circumstances, the factory should not delay any longer for reasons. The meaning is clear (3) The course of the dispute On April 1st of this year, workers from various silk factories in Xinzha, Sixth District, went on strike due to the fact that wages should not only not be reduced but should be increased in Shanghai, where the cost of living is increasing. Later, the bureau sent people to persuade and agreed to find a way to mediate so that the factory would restore the original wage amount. The workers followed the orders of their superiors and immediately returned to work. Today, a month has passed, and there is still no news of restoration. The panic of the workers has reached its peak. Recently, the association and others have repeatedly received complaints from workers about the difficult living conditions, crying and crying. Therefore, on the 25th and 26th of last month, the association and others sent letters to the guild, relaying the plight of the workers, requesting that the guild notify each factory to restore wages to the original amount starting from May 1st. Unexpectedly, ten days have passed and the guild has ignored it. The workers in the two districts are worried and angry. The association and others have no choice but to petition for mediation in order to achieve the goal so that the workers can work hard at production with peace of mind and avoid accidents. Therefore, I urge you to mediate fairly and urgently.</p>

<p>The dispute over settling accounts in the refining industry was recently mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau, which approved a temporary suspension of goods acceptance for ten days, as published in newspapers, specifically for clearing and organizing refining accounts. Regarding the contentious issue of refining prices, several negotiations with the other party have resulted in agreements with various guilds, including the Silk Reeling Guild and the Electrical Silk Weaving Guild, to settle payments according to the public market price. Currently, the Qianjiang Guild and the Shengjing Guild have yet to resolve their issues and are reportedly still preparing for consultations.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Various Industries Request Reduction in Business Tax <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Western Clothing Industry: The Shanghai Western Clothing Trade Association has submitted petitions to the Municipal Government and Finance Bureau regarding business tax issues. It is reported that the association's members, due to the high tax rates being unbearable, recently submitted a supplementary statement of opinions to the Municipal Government and Finance Bureau. An excerpt of the original text is as follows: "Submitted as a supplementary statement on business tax opinions, humbly requesting review and adoption to reduce the business tax rate for the Western clothing industry, alleviating the burden on businesses and sustaining people's livelihoods. Having previously read in the newspaper that (Your Honor) (Director of the Finance Bureau) has issued statements on the business tax issue, accommodating the opinions of merchants and residents as much as possible, our association previously presented our humble views on March 16 and dispatched Wang Lianfang and six others to meet with (Your Honor) (Director of the Finance Bureau), requesting consideration of the difficulties faced by businesses and a lenient drafting of the business tax rate for the Western clothing industry to sustain people's livelihoods. Unexpectedly, the April 20 newspaper reported that (The Municipal Government Finance Bureau) (Your Bureau) intends to set the draft business tax rate for Western clothing manufacturing at 20 per mille of capital, and for sales at 10 per mille of turnover, both at the highest rates. The clothing industry is taxed at 5 per mille of capital, while the garment industry is taxed at 2 per mille of turnover. The business tax rates for the same type of business are so disparate, which is contrary to Your Honor's principle of considering merchants and residents. Our Western clothing, as a type of clothing, is in the same category as robes and jackets, serving as the primary necessity for warmth and covering the body, and is universally used around the world. Article 4 of the national uniform system regulations also adopts it, and all military, political, industrial, commercial, and academic circles are happy to use it. It does not seem to be in the category of goods to be eliminated. Moreover, the price of domestically produced Western clothing is only about five or six yuan in national currency, while robes, jackets, and similar items made of silk or foreign goods cost no less than forty or fifty yuan. Therefore, Western clothing is not of a luxury nature. For example, if Western clothing manufacturers use Western methods and robe manufacturers use Chinese methods, they are both manufactured by Chinese people and are manual industries. Moreover, retailers of overcoats, cloaks, capes, and other clothing items are in the same business as Western clothing retailers. Therefore, the business tax rate for the Western clothing industry should be the same as that for the clothing manufacturing industry, and the sales industry should be taxed at 2 per mille, with no disproportionate burden imposed. Your Honor is knowledgeable about business conditions and widely gathers opinions from various industries. We hereby submit this document, humbly requesting review and adoption to reduce the business tax rate for the Western clothing industry to sustain people's livelihoods. This would be a great kindness."</p>
<p>Clock and Watch Industry: Since the Finance Bureau announced the draft business tax assessment standards and tax rate table for the city, the tax rate for the clock and watch industry is listed in the highest tier, alongside cosmetics. The preparatory committee of the industry's association believes that clocks and watches are daily necessities and that taxing them at the same rate as cosmetics is inappropriate. They convened an emergency meeting of the preparatory committee and decided to send letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various industry tax rule research committees, requesting them to forward a request to the Finance Bureau for a reduction. They also dispatched Zhuang Honggao, Chen Duomin, and Yan Boying to the business tax preparation office to appeal and submit a written statement expressing their firm resolve. An excerpt of the statement is as follows: "Submitted to humbly present the situation and request consideration. We have read in Announcement No. 1 from Your Office that the 'Regulations and Implementation Rules for the Collection of Business Tax in This City, as well as the Assessment Standards and Tax Rate Table, have been drafted by Your Office after inviting consultants, specialized commissioners, and others to deliberate and will be discussed with representatives from the Chamber of Commerce to ensure appropriateness. Business tax is a newly created tax, and thorough research is essential at the outset. If the various industry associations in this city have any opinions, they should be submitted to the Chamber of Commerce representatives for compilation or directly to Your Office for discussion within two weeks.' This shows Your Office's open-mindedness and extensive consultation. Our association's clock and watch industry has a tax rate of 20 per mille for manufacturers and 10 per mille for retailers. Clocks and watches are tools for measuring time and are essential for people's livelihoods. Individuals and organizations cannot maintain punctuality without clocks and watches, which would lead to chaos and instability in society. This is not an exaggeration. The work and rest schedules of various organizations, such as political, industrial, and commercial groups, are determined by a fixed time. Without clocks and watches to measure time, railway transportation would inevitably suffer repeated failures. Without clocks and watches, ocean-going steamships cannot know their speed and would be like blind people riding blind horses, creating dangerous situations. These are just a few major examples, and their close relationship with people's livelihoods is such that they cannot be dispensed with even for a day. Since clocks and watches are essential for people's livelihoods and their absence would affect social stability, even though most clocks and watches are imported, their importance is comparable to that of wages, rice, cloth, and silk. How can they be regarded as luxury goods simply because they are imported? If it is said that clocks and watches made of gold and silver should be classified as luxury goods, then the grades of rice are also numerous. In terms of the higher grades, they can also be regarded as luxury goods. Cosmetics are absolute luxury goods. The tax rate for our clocks and watches is the same as that for cosmetics. Comparing the cost of cosmetics with the cost of clocks and watches, it is self-evident which is heavier and which is lighter. The cost is so light, and the needs of people's livelihoods are so great. How can it be appropriate to levy the same tax on such different items? Since the need for clocks and watches is equal to that for wages, rice, cloth, and silk, whether manufacturing or selling, the tax rate should be the same as 1 per mille, which is fair. Therefore, we have prepared this detailed statement and humbly request your review and adoption to maintain people's livelihoods. This would be a public service. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<p>Cosmetics Industry: The Cosmetics Trade Association submitted a document to the Municipal Government and Finance Bureau the other day regarding the business tax issue, stating, "Submitted to request a reduction in the business tax rate for the cosmetics industry to benefit domestic products and maintain people's livelihoods. The April 20 newspaper reported that (The Municipal Government Finance Bureau) (Your Bureau) intends to set the draft business tax rate for the cosmetics industry at 20 per mille of capital for manufacturers and 10 per mille of turnover for retailers, both at the highest rates, causing widespread consternation. The unit price of domestically produced cosmetics is only a few cents or a few dimes, and their uses include dental care, skin care, relief of existing ailments, and promotion of health. They are daily necessities for personal hygiene, unlike imported cosmetics, which cost more than one yuan per unit and are used by wealthy families and those who indulge in luxury. Most imported cosmetics in our country are sold by Western medicine businesses or foreign goods businesses, so their business tax rate only needs to be paid once according to the Western medicine or foreign goods business rate. However, domestic cosmetics manufacturers never sell imported finished cosmetics, which is one proof that the cosmetics manufacturing industry in this city is purely operated by Chinese merchants. Therefore, the business tax rate is already levied on the factory as a manufacturer, on the distribution center as a wholesaler, and on the retail store as a retailer. Domestic cosmetics that have undergone three stages of taxation want to compete with imported cosmetics that are taxed only once. That is like climbing a tree to catch fish. Now, the government is actively promoting domestic goods and issuing clear orders to encourage industry. As recently reported, the Ministry of Industry has consulted the Ministry of Finance to exempt taxes on imitated foreign goods, stating that the raw materials used for these machine-made goods are mostly purchased from abroad and have already been taxed once upon import. It seems that taxes should not be levied again after the goods are manufactured to increase their burden. Moreover, many machine-made foreign goods are daily necessities for people's livelihoods. If the tax is too heavy, the cost will naturally increase, directly affecting the sales of domestic goods and indirectly encouraging the import of foreign goods. The principal and surcharges should be exempted to show encouragement and provide relief. Our domestically produced cosmetics are one of the items that should be exempt from taxes, and the business tax rate should also be leniently drafted so that domestic production can develop and recover lost profits. (The Finance Bureau) (Your Bureau) publishes the solicitation of opinions from various industries, and the intention is none other than this. We hereby submit this document, humbly requesting review and adoption (immediately order the Finance Bureau to) (allow) the business tax rate for the cosmetics industry to be taxed as daily necessities, generally at 2 per mille, to benefit domestic products and maintain people's livelihoods. This would be a great kindness." They also sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, saying, "Respectfully, we previously read in the newspaper that the Municipal Finance Bureau is collecting opinions from various industries for the business tax issue for discussion. Therefore, our association submitted a document to Mayor Zhang and Finance Bureau Director Hao on May 4 (same as above). However, we later heard that the Ministry of Finance's interpretation of the scope of business tax is that wholesalers who directly purchase from manufacturers can be exempted from taxation. However, the draft tax rate set by the municipal government is still higher than the regulations for the Western medicine industry and the foreign goods industry. Therefore, we request that Your Association forward the above-mentioned information to the five representatives attending the Finance Bureau meeting, considering the difficulties of our industry, and strive for our rights to alleviate our distress. We hope you will consider and reply with great anticipation."</p>
<p>Fish Industry: The Ice-Fresh Fish Trade Association recently submitted a statement of reasons and opinions to the various industry associations of the city's Tax Rule Research Committee, requesting a reduction in the tax rate for the fish industry, which the Municipal Finance Bureau intends to include in the 2 per mille tax category. The reasons stated in the opinion letter generally say that fish is a common food item and is especially needed by the general working class. Considering the current fish prices, the lower-priced ones sell for only about three or four yuan per load, which is actually cheaper than ordinary local vegetables. Moreover, ice-fresh fish are exposed to the dangers of wind and waves in the ocean during harvesting and transportation, and they are often robbed by pirates. The hardship and suffering are far greater than those of other industries. This should be taken into account when levying taxes, and special consideration should be given to reducing the tax burden. What should be especially noted is that in recent years, Japanese fishing boats have frequently crossed the border to fish, acting as the host and causing great aggression. Not only is the livelihood of fishermen becoming increasingly tight, but the fish industry is also gradually declining. The government of our country, aware of this, knows that it must be remedied as soon as possible. It has recently announced a clear order to exempt all fish taxes and fishery taxes, sincerely setting up ways to eliminate the impact of Japanese fishermen and to actively maintain and give preferential treatment to the fishing industry. Reducing their burden by one cent is to increase their vitality by one cent. In this way, the great effect can be achieved from the root. Therefore, the business tax of the fish industry should be changed to the 1 per mille category to be taxed, so that it can live up to the government's intention to promote it and make its revitalization hopeful. The future of the fish industry is very fortunate.</p>
<p>Pollen Industry: The Pollen Trade Association held a regular meeting yesterday, attended by Jiang Shouqi, Xu Furu, Song Yunji, Yang Housheng, Cao Liting, and others, to discuss business matters. It was resolved that, although there are no explicit regulations on how much to collect for this industry, those in charge may not fully understand the various difficulties involved. Therefore, it is necessary to state the facts and make a request. The original letter reads, "We are pleased that the comrades have been fighting legally to reach the goal of 2 per mille for the current business affairs in this city. We have exhausted our wisdom and spared no effort, and our association is especially grateful. We have something to ask. Although there are no explicit regulations on which category our pollen industry belongs to, we dare to briefly state the actual difficulties of our industry to avoid powder discrimination in the future. Our industry has a long history and is purely a national handcraft. After the intrusion of imported goods, it has plummeted and is in danger of extinction. Fortunately, the recent promotion of domestic goods has been revived slightly, otherwise it would have disappeared from the market long ago. However, the scale of business is very small, less than one-ten-thousandth compared with imports. It is difficult to survive with heavy taxes. In order to revive the national industry, we request that the comrades do their best to require that the business tax of our industry should not exceed 1 per mille to show the government's concern and to protect the business with a long history."</p>

<p>Xu Zhu, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 7, Sandeli, Fusantang Street, Xiaonanmen, Nanshi, aged 46, was walking to the street to buy vegetables in a basket around 9 am yesterday. Unexpectedly, when she was passing by Waicangqiao Street, a robber suddenly came behind her and snatched a pair of gold earrings from her ears. She immediately shouted for help as she felt the pain. Police Chief Du Longzhang, who was in charge of the district, heard the cry and rushed to intercept the robber. The stolen goods were recovered and brought back to the police station. During the preliminary interrogation by the station chief, the robber confessed his name was Wang Fubao, 20 years old, from Pudong, lodging at the Daxing Inn in Hongkou. He claimed that he had been unemployed for a long time and was in financial difficulty, so he had no choice but to resort to this. Because it was a daylight robbery, he was immediately sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>— Jie Lu</p>
<p>If a person can set a goal, there is nothing that cannot be achieved. Once a goal is set, diligently develop resources, frugally manage expenses, treat people with humility and harmony, and examine oneself with an open mind. This is the path to success. In the past, someone offered the secret to getting rich to someone. A certain Mr. Jia used money to request this secret and received a piece of paper wrapped up. Upon opening it, it clearly read: "Diligence and Frugality," with no other secret. Although this is a playful story, it is a timeless saying. Ye Chengzhong, a boatman, and Yang Sisheng, a carpenter, both accumulated millions of assets through honesty, simplicity, diligence, and thrift. To this day, the Chengzhong Pudong and Second Schools stand tall on the Shanghai Bund, inspiring admiration. Some say that without luck and opportunity, one cannot succeed. If Ye Chengzhong had not encountered the Westerner who lost gold, and Yang Sisheng had not encountered the booming construction era, how could they have enjoyed such great fame? Therefore, luck and opportunity are bridges to success in life. However, from my own observation of these two individuals, there is no doubt that they embodied the ancient saying "seek much happiness for oneself." Why ask about luck and opportunity? One is Chen Baoshan, who collects old goods. Baoshan, from Wu, came to Shanghai alone fifteen years ago, carrying a basket and buying rags, glass bottles, and newspapers along the streets to make a living. He ate large pancakes and fried dough sticks to fill his stomach and slept in a garret at night, living the life of a garret dweller. In the morning, he scooped tap water to wash his face instead of using toiletries. He walked dozens of miles along the road every day, working tirelessly. After three years, he had some savings. He realized that there were no vendors selling earthenware jars and daily utensils along the streets, so he sold earthenware jars. He carried them on his shoulders, making a "dang dang" sound as he walked and shouted. Shanghai residents lived in small, cramped houses and often lacked utensils for storing things, so buyers flocked to him, and he made a considerable profit. Baoshan was humble and treated people with harmony, so wealthy families and large residences all knew him. Initially, he exchanged broken items for earthenware jars, and then, due to his honesty and trustworthiness, he gradually engaged in the trade of jewelry and precious stones. One day, he bought a pearl from a certain residence that was round like a bean and had a small handle. The owner reluctantly sold it to him for two taels of gold. Baoshan cut off the handle, and the pearl became perfectly round, white, and radiant. Later, he sold it to a Westerner for ten thousand taels of gold, and thus became wealthy. To this day, Baoshan travels to and from various wealthy families in Shanghai, buying and selling jewelry for the women. Even if the amount is tens of thousands of taels of gold, they trust him without any doubt. Baoshan himself said that when he had accumulated a hundred taels of silver, it was the most difficult time to manage. Small businesses were not worth it, and large businesses were not possible. At that time, he could not find a suitable business in his mind. The other is Fu A'san, who sells candy. A'san, from Yong, is blind in one eye. Foolishly, in Ning Shao Lun, I heard him talking about his success story with great interest. A'san said, "Twenty years ago, I was despised by others, so I held the ambition of 'I would rather not be an official than go to Xiangyang.' I came to Shanghai with one tael of silver and initially lived in a friend's house. Every day, I made a living by selling small candy ducks and chicken gizzards. When selling candy, I gave more or less depending on the wealth of the children. Rich children would often make a fuss if they saw poor children getting more. I would say, 'Your family has a lot of money and can buy more. He happened to get money, so I have to give him more.' Fortunately, young masters, please don't make a fuss. I loved reading novels such as 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' and 'Water Margin' when I was young, and I was very familiar with them. Occasionally, I would tell stories to the children, and more and more people listened, and my business became more and more prosperous. After several years, I accumulated dozens of strings of cash, so I added children's toys and candies, pushing a cart as if it were a miniature children's treasury, traveling back and forth in the neighborhoods without interruption, rain or shine. Now that I am old, I have changed to opening a coal shop. This time, I took my son back to my hometown to sweep the tombs. After twenty years of struggle, I have finally achieved the goal of Fang Qing returning to Xiangyang."</p>

<p>On the second day of the month, the Star Opera Troupe held its fifth rehearsal. I responded to Mr. Tang Jie's invitation and went with my colleague, Mr. Zhang Xueqin, to watch. The traffic on Route Doumer was heavy. When we entered the venue at eight o'clock, the gongs and drums were already sounding, and the performance had been going on for a long time. Ma Yin's and Wang Jiting's "Zhu Lian Village," Huang Yixuan's and Jing Liting's "Bao Lian Deng," Zhou Jianyun's and Ms. Liang Saizhen's "Mei Long Zhen," Zheng Zhengqiu's and Zheng Shihui's "Selling the Horse and Using the Iron Whip," Wang Xianzai's and Ms. Ying Yunwen's and Ying Shaomei's and Xie Yunqing's double performance of "Hong Luan Xi," Ms. Xuan Jinglin's and Wang Yushu's and Hong Zhen's "Fen He Bay," Ma Yin's and Dong Tianya's and Zhang Shichuan's and Zhou Jianyun's and Ms. Hu Die's and Wang Xianzai's and Tang Jie's and Jing Liting's "Dragon and Phoenix Auspicious," "Returning to Jingzhou," and "Lu Hua Dang." The costumes, stage movements, vocals, and acting of the above dramas were all extraordinary and much better than before. That night, there were no fewer than five hundred music lovers, and the seats were full. Those who arrived later shouted for more benches. Former movie star Ms. Zhang Zhiyun also shouted for more benches, creating a lively atmosphere. The Star Opera Troupe's special issue was distributed in the venue. Zhang Danweng wrote the preface and also composed a poem, saying: "Many years of mellow wine have cost me thought, the newspaper preface is for the rehearsal. Last month in Suzhou, I seemed to see from afar, an old friend strolling along the street. Vividly and skillfully, a marvelous female mimics a male. When Zhou Die takes the stage to perform 'Sitting in the Palace,' even though the prince consort shouts that it doesn't matter, he secretly worries about breaking the peony red." I returned late at night and jotted this down.</p>
<p>Also, Shi Weng's record of watching the Star Opera Troupe's fifth rehearsal said: "On May 2nd, I took my grand-nephew Baosen to watch. I felt that the stage was exquisite and the order was well-maintained. The male and female troupe members performed in turn, full of sound and color. Huang Yifeng's makeup in 'Cai Lou Pei' was beautiful, Gu Meijun's figure in 'Wu Long Yuan' was graceful like a willow in the wind, Xu Zhiren's demeanor in 'Si Lang Visits His Mother' was calm and composed, and Huang Lingxian's dignified and beautiful in 'Gan San Guan' was skilled in dancing. Zheng Zhengqiu in 'Huang He Lou' was generous and natural, and Zhou Jianyun's singing in 'Wu Jia Po' was absolutely beautiful. Su Wanjun's high-pitched singing was divine and wonderful. As for Dong Tianya in the play 'June Snow,' she was like an experienced grandmother, a true veteran. Gu Youmin's singing and dancing were like spring flowers, and Xuan Jinglin's sad songs were poignant and delicate, with natural charm everywhere, not forced. It can be said that she is excellent in both appearance and art."</p>
<h3 id="e141">Eight Million Pounds Sterling Nobody Wants <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Da Mei</p>
<p>A communication from London in April stated that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer had accumulated unclaimed funds over the years, which, with interest, now amounted to nearly eight million pounds sterling. The so-called unclaimed funds are the government's debt certificates from past years. Many certificate holders have not come to claim them for many years. The exact number is unknown because government officials fear that disclosing it might cause other incidents, so the total number is still unknown. However, it is estimated that the principal of the debt certificates is four million pounds sterling. The aforementioned huge sum is currently deposited in the Bank of England. The bank issued 68,000 notices, urging certificate holders to come and claim the overdue debts and interest. However, as a result, 12,700 letters were returned by the post office because they could not be delivered. Only about 1,200 letters could be re-sent to new addresses. It can be seen that about nine-tenths of the certificate holders are no longer aware of their whereabouts, having completely disregarded their personal property. Isn't that strange? There are 10,900 households with debt certificates, of which 40 households are entitled to more than 10,000 pounds sterling each. Among them, one household has as much as 187,593 pounds sterling, but no one has come to claim it. According to government officials' investigation, it is believed that these certificate holders are either old, deceased, sick, or living in foreign countries, having forgotten all that they had contributed to the country, or they forgot to include the purchase of government bonds in their wills before their death, so their descendants have no way of knowing. There is also a small group of people who are willing to sacrifice a little money to support the national treasury. These people are all very few nouveau riche. Two years ago, a British woman died in Marseille, France. She was poor and her funeral expenses were covered by relatives and friends. However, it was later discovered that she had bought 40,000 to 50,000 pounds of government bonds before her death, which had long expired and should be refunded. So they inquired with the Bank of England and found that there was indeed 56,000 pounds in her name that could be withdrawn. After deducting the expenses she had borrowed, her descendants suddenly made a fortune. According to the British Finance Ordinance of 1921, any government bonds that are not claimed after five years will be transferred to the national treasury. However, it is believed that the aforementioned debt is too large and confiscating it would harm the wealth of the people. Therefore, it is now being handled with flexibility, extending the deadline to ten years before it can be confiscated. It is also found that the aforementioned debt certificates are all of several types, such as Consols and Reduced Threes.</p>

<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>On the 29th, the president of the Theological Society, Dr. and Secretary-General Dasha, requested a photo. Mrs. Cousins sent me a letter inviting me to the Asian Women's Association in Lahore and showed me the association's progress. Mrs. Cousins is an artist and writer who claims to be Irish, but has lived in India for a long time and is familiar with Eastern culture. Therefore, she has worked hard to help India and open the Asian Women's Association, having been imprisoned twice. When asked about history, I showed her various photos. When she saw those wearing Western clothes, she could not find who was me in the photos and blamed me, saying, "Why are you wearing foreign clothes? Who will recognize you as a Chinese person?" She disapproved of me not wearing Western clothes in India, but in the Nanyang area, almost no one wears Chinese clothes. Those who wear Chinese clothes are despised by everyone, because their spirits have been conquered for a long time. There are two Western female leaders in India, one is Miss Benson and the other is Mrs. Cousins, both Irish.</p>
<p>On this day, there was a lecture at the Asian Education Association, with about 3,000 listeners. There were two Chinese representatives, one of whom was elected chairman. There were also Japanese and Turkish representatives. Lawyer Mu Keji, a disciple of mine, also gave a lecture. His eyes were like lightning and his mouth was like a torrential river, his voice shaking the entire venue of 3,000 people. Mu is my Saint Paul.</p>
<p>On the 30th, I went to a women's school conference and met the celebrity Bao Guang, who said he was the highest person in the Indian academic world and wanted me to stay at his home. I could not go because I would be leaving Varanasi soon.</p>
<p>On the 31st, I took the train to Allahabad for three or four hours. The second-class fare was more than three yuan. I was guided by Lawyer Mu. We arrived at his in-laws' house at noon. Mu stood outside the door for a long time. His mother-in-law came out, but his wife could not come out to see me. I was surprised and asked him why. He replied, "This is our custom." I did not get to enter the house until the evening, which was also strange. In the evening, I took a walk in the city under the moon with university students. This city is very wide, clean, and has many trees. The air is clean, not only very different from the smoke and dust of Varanasi, but also more so than Calcutta. It is very similar to Penang. There are no British goods in the city, and few Chinese goods. It is said that there will be a strike tomorrow for a Gandhian-style mass movement. Lawyer Mu has three sons. I saw that the eyes of the youngest child were all blue, different from his father. Mu told me that our races have the same parents, but are different in black and white, perhaps from the father or from the mother. The eyes of the Indians prove that the Aryans are of the same race.</p>
<p>I find the strange customs in India very difficult, especially the matter of excretion. Since ancient times, people in the tropics have used their left hand to wipe themselves after defecating, so the left hand is considered unclean. However, what is strange is that they do not know how to use chopsticks to eat, but use their hands to grab food, but only with their right hand. We consider them unclean, but they say that those who use paper are unclean and impure. My friend occasionally uses paper himself, but dares not say it publicly, saying that his family and friends all say it is unclean and no one dares to approach him. People in Nanyang are obsessed with cleanliness because of the tropics, bordering on superstition. They use their hands to find feces and dig their feet, and at the same time use their hands to cook and eat. If these habits are not changed, it will be difficult to stand in today's scientific and cultural forest.</p>

<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Having encountered this second accident, I was very clear in my mind that the person in front must have committed an illegal act, and the person behind must be a detective in pursuit. I was unfortunate to be caught in the middle, which caused the detective to misunderstand. I turned around and saw that the person chasing was already running close to me. The person was tall and wearing a black robe with no mandarin jacket. He was wearing a dark yellow striped tweed cap, which was pressed very low, but I could still see his dark and sinister face and a pair of round eyes under the electric light. He was clearly a plainclothes detective. My previous assumption had been confirmed. He must have misunderstood me. As he approached, I opened my mouth first and said, "Friend, you've made a mistake!" His right hand was holding a shiny nickel-plated pistol, the muzzle fixed on me. He coldly replied, "Who's made a mistake?" I said, "Don't you see that the person in front has turned the corner?" The burly man with the sinister face was very calm. He replied, "That's right, let him go." I said, "You can't let this person go." He said, "With you here, it's the same." I felt that his prejudice was very deep, and I couldn't find the right words to dispel his misunderstanding. I could only say, "You've really made a mistake. You can't let this person go. Chase after him quickly!" He said, "Won't you buy some candy to fool me?" I couldn't help but get annoyed and said, "You're stuck on the horns of a dilemma! This person is the criminal, and now he's getting away scot-free. You'll be responsible for that!" He also raised his voice and replied, "Catching the thief with the stolen goods is my responsibility. Isn't that thing on you?" As he said this, he took a step forward and pressed the muzzle of the gun against my chest. Suddenly, he reached out and touched the pocket of my left coat. In an instant, the necklace wrapped in a white cloth was in his hand. Then, a sinister smile appeared on his face. The triumphant state of frowning and squinting was hateful and ridiculous to see. Under these circumstances, if I followed my nature, I would risk everything and fight him. However, I had more experience and was confident that I had some scientific attitude. If I resisted him, I would not only be making the same mistake as him, but also risk losing the opportunity to clear myself. Because judging from this person's job, such measures were appropriate. Since he didn't know me, this misunderstanding was not easy to explain, and it was excusable in terms of the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e144">The Gold Market Shows a Slight Rising Trend <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Initial Weakness and Subsequent Strength</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 5th, was the second day of the Spring Races, and the gold exchange was still only open for half a day in the morning. The benchmark gold price rebounded and showed a rising trend, but it was weak in the morning and then gradually strengthened, eventually becoming slightly softer. It is estimated that there were fluctuations in the market due to the divergent trends in overseas silver markets, with prices falling in England and rising in the United States. Therefore, the gold price also fell. Afterwards, the Bao Fang was diligent, and although the foreign exchange quotation increased by half a notch, the internal market was still stable. It is said that the external market was loose and the internal market was tight, and the rumors in the market began to subside, so the market turned gentle. The price has exceeded 40 taels. Afterwards, the supply exceeded demand, and the market was slightly softer, but there were not many transactions in the market.</p>
<p>There were slight fluctuations. The opening price for June was slightly lower by 7 cents, at 737 taels, because the large bar price fell by one-sixteenth, while the silver price rose by one-eighth. There were no increases or decreases in private telegrams. Ju Chang and others first sold, and then Tong Tai Chang, Zhi Feng, Yong Chun Yuan, Yong Wan Xing, and others came to buy, immediately adding 2 taels. When the first order was announced, it was 39 taels. The quotation increased by .125 US dollars. The gold price increased by 1.25 cents and then fell back to 38 taels. The British gold price was once bought by the Japanese Bank at 1.34375. Afterwards, Da Xing, Yong Qian Chang, Xiang, and others all made purchases. Moreover, Shanghai and Hua Yi mutually traded British gold for July at 3.75. The Mai Hang and Mei Feng traded for June at 3.125. The market became stronger and jumped by more than 5 taels to 43 taels and 5 cents at 9:30. Subsequently, the lower reaches sold, including Yong Feng, Yuan Cheng, and Yong, until it was 41 taels and 23 cents at 10:00. Chang Sheng, Yong Chun Yuan, Yong Da Xing, Yong Yuan Xing, and others came to buy, and it rose again by several taels and cents. After 10:30, it was 44 taels and 8 cents. Afterwards, Yong Feng, Shun Li, and others sold a lot, so the price gradually depreciated by more than 3 taels, with only 1 tael fluctuation. After 11:15, it was only 41 taels and 3 cents. Yuan Cheng, Da De Cheng, and others followed up, and the price rose again by 2 taels and some change. At 11:30, it was 43 taels and a half. However, Da De Cheng, Yong Feng, and others sold again, and because British gold at 3.125 could be settled, it was difficult for the price to increase, so it retreated to 41 taels. In a moment, it rose by some change to 2 taels and 23 cents. When the market closed at noon, it was still only 41 taels. It was then traded at 1 tael. The Cantonese group slightly advanced. Compared to the previous noon (according to the quotation), it rose by 3 taels and 3 cents. According to the half-day period, the maximum price was 44 taels and 8 cents, and the minimum price was 37 taels, a difference of 7 taels and 8 cents. Early market for goods was 37 taels, and noon closing was 41 taels. The announced price was changed to 777 taels, calculated at 39 taels to 32 or 33 taels. The noon closing was 36 taels, the registered price was 41 taels, and the water supplement was 39 taels.</p>
<p>Trading was normal. The trading of the same industry was not equal. Zhi Feng Yong, Chang Sheng Yong, Cui Chang Yong, Da Xing Yong, Chun Yuan Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Xing, Tong Tai Chang and others all advanced. Heng Yu, Fu Yu, Yuan Cheng, Qian Chang Xiang, Yuan Tai, Fu Tai Heng, Da De Cheng and others came in and out. Yong Feng, Ju Chang, Yuan Cheng Yong, Shun Li and others sold a lot. Fu Chang, Yuan Heng, and Wan Xing all slightly advanced. The Dalian group sold five or six hundred bars and advanced more than three hundred bars. The Cantonese group only bought more than two hundred bars.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Yarn Market: Prices Initially Rose, Then Fell, Continuing Weak Trend <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose, then fell, with an overall weak trend. Rumors about the current political situation remain rampant, and actual sales feel quite sluggish. As agricultural activities in various regions gradually become busy, most people share a unanimous sentiment to sell. It is said that the factories' bottom stock is increasing again, especially of 10-count coarse yarn, causing exceptional hardship for yarn factories. The Ningbo Hefeng Yarn Factory has already formally suspended operations due to expensive raw materials and sluggish yarn sales. Shanghai also faces similar difficulties.</p>
<p>People's Standard (Ren Biao) Market: Still in a weak situation, with unmelted tags.</p>
<p>The People's Standard market opened with upward trends in American cotton, causing nervous sentiment. Selling pressure slightly decreased, and prices for all months rose by 5, 4, 6, and 8 mace (a unit of currency) to 1.2 taels (another unit of currency). In the afternoon, news of weak spot sales and a large merchant intending to release inventory in the current month, combined with numerous rumors about the current political situation, suddenly weakened market momentum. Prices fell by 5, 6, and 9 mace to 1.2 taels. The current month fell by 2 taels. Total transactions amounted to 32,050 bales. Sales included 2,050 bales from Gengfeng, 2,300 bales from Zaichang, 1,300 bales from Yida, 850 bales from Yilong, 600 bales from Tianlong, and 600 bales from Rongxing. Purchases included 1,150 bales from Gengfeng, 800 bales from Jifeng, 750 bales from Heshen, 900 bales from Yuda, and 700 bales from Changfeng. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>Weak Spot Yarn Consumption</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are flat. Statistics for the entire day show that various groups purchased only 590 bales. Among trading companies, 450 bales were bought at flat prices. Among merchant groups, 135 bales were bought for inland areas, 75 bales for Sichuan, 100 bales for Hankou, 40 bales for Qinhuangdao, 130 bales for Weihaiwei, and 105 bales for various other areas.</p>

<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. Although overseas cotton trends upward, the Shanghai spot cotton mills remain sluggish. Some manufacturers have surplus inventory, and due to sluggish yarn sales, there are talks of suspending operations. As a result, raw material consumption is inevitably reduced. Therefore, sellers are bolder, anticipating rises and shorting positions. The future depends on American cotton.</p>
<p>Han Standard (Han Biao) Market: Near-term prices rise, long-term prices fall.</p>
<p>The Han Standard market opened with upward trends in American cotton, creating positive sentiment. Buying pressure increased, and prices for all months rose by 2 to 3 cents (small units of currency). In the afternoon, due to sluggish yarn sales and talks of yarn factories suspending operations, sentiment suddenly loosened. Prices fell by 1 cent to 2.5 cents. Total transactions amounted to 73,100 dan (unit of weight). Sales included 4,200 dan from Yida, 2,300 dan from Gongtai, 2,600 dan from Taixing, 3,100 dan from Tongxing, and 1,800 dan from Changfeng. Purchases included 2,100 dan from Shenchang, 2,300 dan from Yongzhi, 2,500 dan from Shenji, 2,100 dan from Jinfeng, and 1,500 dan from Jifeng. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>American cotton rebounded by 30 points. Yesterday, American cotton was initially calm and firm due to a lack of Bao Hu accounts. Later, due to good news from Liverpool and short covering, prices increased, with futures up 28 to 32 points and spot up 30 points. English cotton futures fell 3-4 points, and spot fell 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose 5 points. The Indian cotton market was good, with a fall of 2 rupees. Laji and Bai Luo Xi remained unchanged. The original telegram is recorded below (dated 4th):</p>

<h3 id="e152">Grain Market: Ke Xin Rice Digested Well Locally and Revitalized <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xin rice market was actively traded locally, with prices showing a slight upward trend. Because less river rice arrived and it was difficult to find good quality rice, local merchants turned their attention to Ke Xin rice. The owners of Ke Xin rice, due to the increasingly hot weather making it difficult to store rice for long, were eager to sell early, so prices did not rise sharply. The overall market opened with 3,000 bags of Jiangxi Machine Late rice at 11.39 yuan to 10.70 yuan, and 260 bags of Machine Early rice at 10.02 yuan to 10.00 yuan. 1,000 bags of Hunan Machine rice were priced at 11.15 yuan to 11.00 yuan, all of which were bought by local merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Flour Market Trends Stabilizing Again <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market prices for each month generally trended towards stability again. The current climate is excessively humid with sufficient rainfall, which is causing concern for wheat fields. This led inland merchants and local merchants to become more firm in their thinking. Although merchant groups were still quiet and there was no change in the quoted price of foreign wheat, the market trend remained favorable. If the weather becomes clear and pleasant, the market may loosen a bit. As a result, this month was 7.5 li (small unit of currency) better than the previous day, June was 7.5 li better, July was 1 fen (larger unit) better, August was 1.25 li better, September was 7.5 li better, and October was 7.5 li better.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Wheat Market in a Quiet Situation <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, the market prices for each month generally fluctuated. However, transactions in each market were still active because the quoted price of foreign wheat did not surprise anyone and there were few opportunities for both buyers and sellers to take advantage. By the afternoon, the market trend in each market remained stable and transactions were very quiet. Although the weather was not good, buyers remained cautious and did not move forward. Looking ahead, it is feared that there will be a temporary standstill. As a result, this month was 1 fen better than the previous day, July was 1 fen better, August was unchanged, and September was slightly more than 1 fen lower. All others were not opened.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Sugar Market: Daily Sugar Inventory Thin, Prices Slightly Rise <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports from producing areas indicated that Cuban spot sugar was unchanged. New York futures sugar for May fell 1 point, September and December each fell 3 points, and next year's March fell 2 points. Java spot and futures sugar still lacked price increases or decreases. In the Association market, Dutch 24-grade coarse white sugar buying interest was still scarce, and shipments were quite frequent. Quoted prices of 10.05 taels were met with lackluster inquiry. 20-grade medium white sugar at 10 taels saw slight transactions, but the market was also flat. Japanese sugar, due to relatively thin market inventory, recently surveyed to be only over 210,000 bags, saw increased sentiment and sudden price increases. However, buying interest was not strong, and the subsequent market showed slight transaction trends. N Mark at 10.0575 taels to 10.06 taels, TM Mark at 10.02 taels, YT Mark at 10.05 taels, YP Mark at 10.09 taels, J Mark at 11 taels, TK Mark new goods at 10.06 taels. The market trend was still favorable. Factory deliveries of Dali for July shipment N Mark were priced at 4.45 yuan Japanese gold new standard plus tax, but merchant interest was weak and no transactions were made for the time being. Some firms sold spot medium white sugar from Hua Xin brand at 10 yuan, and the market trend was flat. Domestic Huanggang Qing brand slightly loosened, with sales to the north still active. Yesterday, over 400 bags were opened at prices of 7.70 taels to 7.75 taels, and the market seemed firm.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Spring Race in Shanghai. As usual, foreign firms took a half-day afternoon holiday. The silk market in foreign firms was only open for half a day in the morning. Overseas silk reports were still scarce for Shanghai, and prices remained low. Yesterday, only Lianna and others brought in 15 bales of Shanghai white factory at high prices and 10 bales of coarse yellow silk at flat prices.</p>

<p>Cold weather prevents molting, development is very slow.</p>
<p>This year, farmers in the north and south of Jiaxing, due to reduced production last year, purchased improved silkworm seeds (commonly known as foreign seeds) from the Provincial School and Improvement Association for a discounted price. During the seeding period, due to the cold weather, the hatching of silkworms was delayed, with only 60% of the seeds hatching. As the silkworms were about to enter their third molt, the weather remained cold and rainy, causing the silkworms to be unable to molt and the development of late silkworms to be delayed.</p>

<p>The initial price opened at 75 yuan.</p>
<p>Shexian Jiyuan Yuan Tea is a famous local product of Huizhou. Recently, tea areas in the region have all started garden harvesting and production. Tea shops and merchants have strong intentions to import, and the market is quite lively. The initial batch opened on the 3rd at 75 yuan, lower than last year by 4-5 yuan. According to general tea merchants, the production of green tea in the region is not abundant, and it is difficult to expect low prices.</p>

<p>Recently, the arrival and stock of wool and woolen fabrics have flooded the market, and sales have been sluggish, causing prices to fall step by step. Only silver gingham elephant skin lining thin raincoat fabric trends uniquely popular, with blue being even more scarce and precious. Yesterday, the various brands of silver gingham elephant skin thin raincoat fabric were all sold at 3.2 taels net, with a separate addition of 5-6 cents per piece. If you want to buy blue ones in full, it is difficult to find them without paying 3.56 taels. Its scarcity and popularity truly makes it the crown jewel among woolen fabrics now.</p>

<p>Looking at the recent trend of the tinplate market, it can be said that it is the most prosperous. Factories and merchant groups are eagerly collecting goods, and hoarders, seeing the scarcity of sources, are taking the opportunity to collect, so the market supply cannot meet the demand. As a result, the existing spot goods are scarce. However, the next batch of goods will take several days to arrive, so the market has evolved into a situation of supply shortage. The standard Flying Yellow Tinplate is estimated at 16.5 taels for 90-pound British goods, 17 taels for 100-pound British goods, 17.25 taels for 90-pound American goods, 18.25 taels for 100-pound American goods, 38 taels for 200-pound double-connected American goods, and 35 taels for 200-pound Company Iron.

<h3 id="e165">Advantages of 1931 Model New Cars <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Dai</p>
<p>Various new cars of the 1931 model have been launched one after another. Observing the improvements made by various manufacturers in the production of new cars, the special points which are particularly noteworthy are listed below to inform the readers of this publication.</p>
<p>Low Price: Various new cars of the 1931 model have been displayed on the market. Looking at their advantages, the most amazing thing is the low price. Currently, a good car can be purchased for USD 1,000 or less. Is this something we could have anticipated beforehand? Based on the history of cars, the initial price of new cars in the past was the highest. The price of the same car today is less than 1,000 yuan, and eight-cylinder cars are even flooding the market. The power of these cars is unprecedented, and the appearance of the new cars, both inside and outside, is amazing. The obvious stripes, the smooth exterior, and the clean driver's seat are all admirable. They are truly affordable and high-quality cars.</p>
<p>Beautiful Colors: The colors added to the car body have also greatly improved compared to the past, and the colors of each part are coordinated and consistent. The so-called coordination is not only the appearance, but also the interior. Even the scattered accessories have good-looking colors, reflecting each other without being annoying. Such results would not be possible without the careful research of the factory workers. The construction method is simplified where possible, and reduced where possible, which allows car owners to purchase cars at low prices. In short, the improvements of the new cars of the 1931 model are indeed many, and all of them are surprising. It can be seen that the progress of cars is rapid.</p>
<p>More Cars: In terms of the cars produced by various factories in the past year, there is obviously a new trend, that is, more cylinders. Recalling that in 1929, six-cylinder cars accounted for 60% of the total number of cars produced, while in 1930, eight-cylinder cars accounted for 60%. Compared with each other, they are inversely proportional. It can be seen that the recent trend in car manufacturing is towards more cylinders. With more cylinders, the power of the car itself will naturally increase. The improvement of the pistons and the expansion of the combustion chamber all increase the power of the car.</p>
<p>Transmission System: Analyzing the new cars of the 1931 model, there are 20 types of chassis with four-speed transmissions and 63 types with three-speed transmissions. There is one type where all gears use live gears, and ten types where live gears are only used in the highest or second speed. The improvement of the transmission system in the 1931 model is particularly noteworthy and worth discussing, and has a great impact on business. In addition, the efforts to increase the number of cylinders have even led to the introduction of 16-cylinder cars, and the results are very excellent. This is a major milestone in the history of cars. The improvement of the handle is also sufficient to increase the power of the car.</p>
<p>Other Various Things: The improvements of the new cars of various factories are as described above. In addition, there are many more, and the most satisfactory thing is the sun-shading windshield. Although low-priced cars also have this kind of windshield installed, windshields made of thin glass have become common. Soon, society will need this kind of car. The improvement of the speedometer allows the driver to know the speed while driving, rather than having to observe the speedometer in detail as in the past, and it is quite accurate. There are many other advantages, but due to space limitations, I cannot describe them all here. I can only be brief.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Dodge's Reputation for Sixteen Years <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Dodge is also one of the famous American car factories. Recently, its business has also developed quite well. Since its establishment, it has been sixteen years. During these sixteen years, the factory authorities have worked hard and finally won considerable reputation for the excellent quality of their products and the effectiveness of their operations. Recently, they held a sixteen-week anniversary celebration, which was quite lively. The development of Dodge in the past sixteen years is briefly described below for commemoration, which is also welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>The First Car: On November 14, 1930, the American Dodge car factory held a sixteen-week anniversary celebration, because the Dodge car factory has been established for sixteen years. Recalling sixteen years ago, in 1915, Dodge cars began to be displayed at the car exhibition meeting to meet the society. The development of Dodge in the past sixteen years is quite mysterious. Although there is no sufficient proof that Dodge has a considerable foundation and credibility today, one thing can be told to the readers, that is, the first car produced by Dodge is still running on the streets today, even though it has been sixteen years. We can see it in Nashville, Tennessee. If we make a total of the distance traveled by this car, it has traveled 350,000 miles in sixteen years. The Dodge factory's agent who used to sell this car is still the Dodge factory's distributor today, and the number of cars sold by this person in sixteen years is countless.</p>
<p>The Origin of Reputation: The only reason why Dodge's reputation has a solid foundation is that the factory strives to make the products have considerable value and also strives to save money for car buyers. The main point to achieve this goal is good planning, excellent raw materials, and highly skilled car makers. Otherwise, it is not enough to have affordable and high-quality cars. Looking at the distance traveled by the first Dodge car, it can cross the Earth six times, and the car itself has not had major damage. It can be seen that its excellent performance has been achieved during the driving. This kind of service spirit has been the same for sixteen years and has not changed much so far. When making cars, raw materials must be selected from the best, and the price must be very low after the cars are made. As for Dodge cars still getting social credit today, it is because the new cars have been improved year by year, and the appearance and content can satisfy customers. During these sixteen years, the Dodge car engine has been reformed year by year and has made a lot of progress. It is indeed a good car. Recalling the initial release of the first car that year, it is unimaginable to have such amazing results today. Compared with the past, not only is the material better, but also the horsepower is more, the driving is faster, and the safety problem has also been greatly improved.</p>
<p>Total Number of Cars Sold: During these sixteen years, the number of cars sold by the Dodge factory has reached 2.5 million, and the price paid by car owners has reached more than USD 400 billion. Among the factories in the United States, the number of cars sold is so large and the credit is so stable, which can be called unique. As for making car owners feel satisfied, it is even more a matter of ability. Comparing today's cars with the first car produced at the beginning of the company, the improvements are even more overwhelming. The new cars of each year have many improvements, so Dodge cars can be called perfect today. Regardless of other things, the beauty of the car, the appropriateness of the length, the richness of the power, and the convenience of driving are all admirable. The goal of the factory in making cars is still to strive for affordable, high-quality, and more refined products. Therefore, the new cars of the future will be better than today. There is no doubt.</p>
<h3 id="e167">History of the Development of the British Automobile Industry <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Song Yu</p>
<p>Comparison of Thirty Years Ago and Now</p>
<p>Mr. Fogel Bincley said that thirty years ago, all the private cars, commercial freight cars, and rented buses in Great Britain totaled less than 3,000. At that time, the total number of workers manufacturing cars in the country was only about 2,000. Now the situation is very different. Just in terms of workers manufacturing cars, the total number of workers required in each car factory is at least 500,000. Therefore, many people say that in the current era of commercial decline and the increasing number of unemployed, it is very hopeful to use the automobile industry to alleviate this shortcoming.</p>
<p>No one knows what the speed and durability of cars were at the beginning of the 20th century. The Golden Arrow car was a magical thing. Twelve-cylinder and sixteen-cylinder cars had not yet been designed. At that time, the automobile industry was in its infancy. France had only 2,897 cars at this time, of which 543 were made for industrial experiments. The French automobile industry progressed very quickly only after 1896. A lot of experimental fees were spent. In 1895, the French drove from Paris to Bordeaux and then back to Paris, creating a 744-mile car race record. The car that won the championship had a top piston, a large carburetor, and a very ugly appearance. On rough and uneven roads, it averaged 15 miles per hour.</p>
<p>The Germans paid great attention to the automobile manufacturing industry. In the new century, German engineers spent a lot of effort trying to use cars as a medium of transportation to seek a revolution in transportation. The effect was very good in seven years. Just in 1907, 27,026 cars were built. In 1900, there were only 600 cars in the United States, worth USD 1,290,000. At that time, Henry Ford was just a young mechanic dreaming of building his own car. Sure enough, he became the world's largest car manufacturer. Datcheliwu was a wealthy river city waiting for the climax of the automobile industry to arrive. Circuit judges rode horses back and forth, and there was a fire engine holding the highest speed record.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, Great Britain began to manufacture cars. British car manufacturers spent a lot of money like the French. In this early and unstable start, everyone wanted to hold the qualification of the leader of the automobile manufacturing industry. In this way, everyone inevitably competed, followed by competition for raw materials such as metal materials, oil, rubber, and steel. This is the first scene after the invention of the car and has not stopped until now.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Since 1900, countries have used their capital and capabilities to seek sales in foreign markets. Laws to protect domestic markets have also been passed at the same time. Thousands of dollars have been spent to obtain speed and endurance records. Car travel and steamships and trains have competed with each other and opened up many new places. This is mostly what has happened in the last thirty years. In the early years, when British industry was still wavering, there were often laws restricting the development of the automobile industry. For example, between 1896 and 1904, cars weighing more than three tons were not allowed to run on the roads, and freight cars were even prohibited. In 1900, the Great Britain and Ireland Automobile Club, which is now the Royal Automobile Club, launched a 1,000-mile British car trip in order to arouse the pleasure of car travel. The cars in this car trip team patronized various cities, including Scotland. When the car arrived in a town, it was warmly welcomed. The miners in the cellar abandoned their shovels and came to the ground to see this novel machine that burned gasoline. The driver seemed effortless, so the celebrations of the people were everywhere. Banks and shops were mostly closed. No matter where it was or who it was, everyone was very interested in this new invention of the 20th century machine.</p>
<p>This parade proved to the public that cars were practical items for transportation. By 1905, the number of cars in Great Britain had increased sevenfold. In 1907, car factories produced 1,000 cars and commercial freight cars per month. In 1910, the annual car output was 14,000. Ten years later, there were 80 car manufacturers in England, Scotland, and Ireland. However, only one car factory was in Ireland, in Belfast. The factories employed a total of 40,000 workers. This 80 car manufacturers were established in a certain year 20 years ago. 30 of them still use the old names. The rest have either ceased operations or merged with other car factories, or changed to new brands.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Ford and General Motors Business Reports <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Xiang</p>
<p>The former's net profit was more than $55 million, while the latter increased cash by more than $51 million.</p>
<p>1930 was the most economically panicked era in the United States in over a decade. All industries were withering, the market was depressed, the number of vagrants increased sharply, and purchasing power decreased sharply. Coupled with the impact of unemployment throughout the world, there was no way out for exports. For a year, the society was panicked, and everyone expected that the domestic manufacturing leader would have huge losses. Unexpectedly, things turned out differently. Not only did the manufacturing giant not show weakness, but the huge profits it made were truly astonishing. This point allows us to see that American industry has entered adulthood. Here, I will write down the business conditions of the above-mentioned two major automobile manufacturing companies last year.</p>
<p>Ford: In the past twelve months, the company has won a total net profit of 55 million US dollars, shipped a total of 1.5 million vehicles, and stored 300 million dollars in circulating cash, which is less than the previous year. Its profit was more than 81 million dollars, and a total of more than 1.95 million cars were produced. The company's current economy is extremely strong, and its business is particularly stable. Compared with the difficult situation of lacking cash ten years ago, it is now a world apart. This year's business has shown a turning point. The goods shipped by the company in February have increased by 35% to 41% compared with the same period last year. In March, a total of 95,000 vehicles were produced. This month, an average of 7,000 passenger and freight vehicles can be produced per day. It is expected that the 20 millionth Ford vehicle will be produced on the 14th of this month. The company's two major factories in Dirt Earth City employ a total of 83,425 people, an increase of more than 10,000 people compared with the same period last year. Ford is still making every effort to carry out development plans, such as the new factory in India, the rubber factory in South America, and the recent purchase of a large number of cargo steamships.</p>
<p>General Motors Joint Company: Although trade last year decreased by 34.6% compared with the previous year, cash reserves increased by more than 51 million yuan. The total profit for the year was 151 million yuan, and each share could be divided into 3 yuan and 25 cents, which was less than the previous year's dividend of 5 yuan and 49 cents per share. However, it is fortunate that there is still such a profit in this era of oppression. The company's general manager, Mr. Shi Long, said that the company's economic situation is becoming more and more consolidated. The estimated total assets are more than 130 million and 15,800,000 gold. The annual income exceeds the expenditure, and each group unit cooperates and manages effectively. He is quite optimistic about the future.</p>

<p>Buick's new cars sold well for a time: From July 1930 to the end of last year, in these five months, the number of straight-eight cylinder new cars sold by General Motors was very large, more than one and a half times the number sold by other competitors in a year. In 1930, the number of Buick's new cars sold was 49,464, while the number sold by its competitors in a year was 31,275. This factory is the runner-up in the manufacture of straight-eight cylinder cars. According to Mr. Churchill, the sales director of Buick Motor Company, although the sales figures for the new cars in January this year have not yet been released, judging from the delivery of goods from the factory, the sales figures should still be ranked first and will not fall. Mr. Qiu also said that Buick Company recently announced that the current 1931 straight-eight cylinder cars will continue to be in circulation in the summer and autumn of this year. Those who have new cars on August 1 will be held slowly, so the sales of this new car this spring can be compared with last year.</p>
<p>The Pope's car has a throne: The Rome Milan Automobile Club recently donated a car worth 50,000 yuan to Pope Bishi. This car is magnificent and unprecedented. There is a throne in the car, all plated with gold. When the emperor drives through the city, he always sits in it and looks around for pleasure. This throne can also be removed when necessary and replaced with two seats with high cushions and thick compartments, which are extremely luxurious, so that the Pope can drive and sit with guests. The backs of the cars are decorated with gold, silver, and ivory, and the curtains are made in the Venetian style.</p>
<p>Italian Thousand Mile Car Race: The world's most unique and longest car race is held in Italy every year, with a length of 1,000 miles. This car race originated from the Briss Automobile Club. Each race starts from here and passes through Jiluona Fuluo Laien Rome Anguona to Baoluona Tuolei Fusha Faner Tuowensheng Shifuluona and other places, and finally returns to the starting point of Brissxi. The most unique thing about this competition is that the roads that the competition cars pass through can still be used by other non-competition vehicles during the competition. Later, newspapers published comments requesting residents to automatically abandon this road so that the competition could proceed smoothly. This request was approved by the public, so this year there are more vehicles participating in the competition than in previous years. As many as 140 vehicles of various types participated.</p>
<p>The Remarkable Plymouth Car: The Indian Gorge Road of the Carolina Smoky Mountains has always been known as a dangerous road for travel. Four cars have never set foot on it. This began with the remarkable Plymouth car. Mr. Hao Fu, the owner of a mountain resort in the Smoky Mountains, drove this car from Gatuolinbai in four hours and five minutes. Although the entire journey is only 24 miles long, other vehicles have never reached the other 10 miles except by walking and riding. The mountain is about 5,500 feet high.</p>
<p>Building Automobile Roads in Africa: The remote and smoke-filled hinterland of Africa, where people rarely set foot, now has a network of automobile roads connected to the outside world. The various local products are generally transported to various places using modern transportation methods. The locals who used to carry goods on their backs and travel long distances are now replaced by automobiles. The camel's journey is also replaced by automobiles, which are comfortable and fast. The famous Nile and Congo rivers in Africa are now connected by roads, and there is a regular automobile postal service.</p>
<p>Estimate of US Automobile Tax: The average amount of US automobile tax in 1930 was US$33. This estimate was published by the California Automobile Association and is roughly the same. This average automobile tax of 33 US dollars has increased by 14% compared with the previous year, because the automobile tax levied at that time was only 28 US dollars and 56 cents.</p>
<p>Announcement: Ding Zuze, Zhizheng, Xiao Guoxiang, Yingdai, Xu, Sanyuan, Pei, Fu, Jin Xin, Rong Ruo, Zhuo, Wu Fei, gentlemen, please note that the manuscript fees for last month have been settled. Please go to the accounting department of this museum to collect them from the 12th of this month. The Automobile News Department</p>
