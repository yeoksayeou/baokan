<p>敎育消息　討論</p>
<h3>鳥言獸語的讀物應當打破嗎　（一）陳鶴琴</h3>
<p>（鳥言獸語的讀物一究竟應當不應當打破這是要看以下兩個間題如何的解决</p>
<p>（一）這種讀物小孩子喜歡聽喜歡看喜歡講麽</p>
<p>（二）這種讀物小孩子聽了看了講了究竟受有什麽影響</p>
<p>若是小孩子不喜歡這種讀物我們當然不應該給他若是喜歡的那我們要看究竟這種讀物對於他有沒有壞的影響若是小孩子喜歡這種讀物而受到的影響是很壞那這種讀物當然不適用我們曉得有許多東西小孩子喜歡的而未必對他有好處所以要斷定鳥言獸語的讀物究竟有沒有價値祇要看以上兩點就可以决定的</p>
<p>照我個人的經騐看來鳥言獸語的讀物年幼的小孩子尤其是在七歲以内的小孩子是最喜歡聽最喜歡看至於害處呢我實在看不出什麽不過究竟這種讀物是否兒童所需要的讓我約略的説一説</p>
<p>小孩子在一歲以外的時候對於各種的事物發生許多動作許多興趣我們成人看起來恐怕要覺得很希奇其實從小孩子的眼光看來是一件很平常的事不信請看下面的幾樁事實</p>
<p>（一）騎馬　我的小孩子一鳴在一歲的時期對於無論什麽可騎的東西如桌腿椅背棒頭等都拿來當馬騎不但如此有時他一聽見别人説（馬）這個字的聲音或（騎馬）兩個字的聲音就立刻把身子上下跳動作騎馬的樣子並且嘴裏喊着ａ　ａ　ａ的聲音</p>
<p>這種（棒頭當馬騎）的情形在各國小孩子生活中是一樁很平常很普遍的事這種很平常很普遍的兒童生活我們成人不應當讓兒童享受嗎關於這種生活的讀物故事我們成人不應當讓兒童看讓兒童聽讓兒童講嗎</p>
<p>但是我們又要仔細想想這種（棒頭當馬騎）不是比鳥言獸語還要神怪還要不近情理嗎</p>
<p>（二）洋娃娃　一個一歲多點而尙未能講話的小孩子就有抱了一個洋娃娃用手拍他嘴裏還發出一種ａ　ａ的聲音表示同他講話的意思等到再大一些三歲他就能同洋娃娃談話好像做雙簧的樣子</p>
<p>他眞的相信洋娃娃是眞的小孩子嗎不如他當洋娃娃是眞的小孩子那他就有一種神經病了試問那一國的兒童不論是野變的是開化的是古代的是現今的不玩這種洋娃呢而當洋娃娃是眞的小孩子那恐怕是絕無僅有的事吧</p>
<p>（三）滑稽圖　下面兩張圖畫那一個小孩子看不喜歡呢關於這種圖畫的讀物那一個小孩子不喜歡看呢但是他們相信猪眞的會跳舞嗎水菓眞的像人嗎絕對不會的那末爲什麽我們成人不准他們享受這種好玩的東西呢</p>
<p>（四）滑稽電影　（甲）昨天去看電影第一張片子就是（Ｆｅｌｉｘ）（黑貓）那時全塲的小孩一看見（Ｆｅｌｉｘ）（黑貓）出現就大聲鼓掌高興非常這個滑稽故事在中國大陸報上常常豋載的這隻黑貓不但會講話而且所做的事情往往出乎情理違反自然而人力所不能做的</p>
<p>但是小孩子相信黑貓眞的有這樣能力嗎他們是絕對不相信的但是看的時候他們表示十二分的快樂看了之後他們並沒有回家去把自已違</p>
<p>家裏的貓也當做（Ｆｅｌｉｘ）一般看待</p>

<p>我們更不可誤會他們的不景氣由於生産過剩歸罪於科學不景氣不盡由於生産過剩就把生産過剩一點説來也祇可以説他們運用科學沒有恰到好處而不能罪及科學本身而况他們的不景氣還有數目字可以計算像科學不發達　的中國不景氣還可以數目字計算魔麽即如失業統計他們有報告我們還可以數計麽我們要曉得平時的建設固然完全是科學一旦戰爭起來除掉科學的權威還有什麽能宰制一切未來的科學戰爭比過去的還要厲害萬倍我敢斷言所以到這個時候來提倡科學研究科學並不是趕熱鬧撑門面簡直是我們國家和民族要找一條死裏求生的出路咧</p>
<p>第三大家團結起來這怕是頂難交的卷子了二十年來就是這弱點暴露得頂厲害國家觀念沒有大發達疆域來得大交通的時日尙淺風俗方言種種不同只隨處表示地方思想的强固狠少表示熱烈的國家思想凡人羣的團結至少有兩個必要條件即對外有一共同的對象和對内有一共同的信仰中心現在國際間的壓迫一天緊似一天羣以外的共同對象日漸顯明了就是信仰中心狠不易養成原來信仰全出於自然無可勉强有了主義還須看執行主義的人而自從思潮亢進以後對中心人物的責望越高條件越苛從前不過文治和武功罷了現在要取得羣衆信爷仰怕還得兼有現代人物像甘地的人格使人家一天一天的認識清楚一天一天的信仰堅固專靠文治固然爬不上舞　專靠武功也不易把守最後勝利必歸於文治武功以外兼備第三關於人格條件的領袖</p>
<p>可是話要説回來了我所希望於一般國人的旣然了解共同生活的眞意義不團結的結果必至同歸於盡則惟有把最易犯的心病就是猜疑妬忌傾軋造謡誣衊排除異已等等好像三家村裏老婆子的怪脾氣一掃而空而代以相親相愛的誠意可是相親相愛和相忍爲國不同相忍不可以爲國如果一團體中果有人幹他干犯法紀妨礙公衆的事斷不可因其同在一團體而寛容他否則何以使别人尤其是團體以外的人折服呢所以親愛精誠清剛正氣八個字須同時實現總之人治必得和法治並行·然後大團結纔得穩固</p>

<p>「青天白日滿胡同唱着這樣傷風敗俗的曲子你想挨揍嗎」他抬頭一看原來是個崗上的警士惡狠狠的向着他説話張小三兒低了頭將車拉着低了頭緩緩的走口裏可就咕噥着道「這又碍着你什麽事拉車的都該死高興唱一兩句都不行」警士也明聽見他口裏在反駁只要他不唱了也就不去理他張小三兒的車子又拉遠些了他見對面來了一位同志也是緩緩的拉着空車便自言自語道「他媽的邪門兒當巡警的總是和拉洋車的過不去」拉車睥有這麽一種愛交朋友愛成仇敵的怪脾氣大街上彼此拉拉着車只要是同在一個車主之下一面走着一面大談特談雖然喘着氣流着汗也是有問必答反之或者誰碰了誰一下或者誰碍了一點路線馬上用他們的上人以至於親戚拿來作對篤的交戰品</p>

<p>棉市仍堅因底貨單薄各路來貨缺乏但美棉逐步趨跌且發現新低價所以人心不虚實以現貨枯新抛户皆不敢貿然舉動市盤遂成僵局生意甚少多空兩方皆抱觀望態度云</p>

<h3>標粉平疲之象</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上下午開盤後各月份市面大致趨盤旋平疲之象以洋麥之報價續小二三四角左右不等天時亦良好如常新麥收穫之際有此晴暢之天氣實屬難得且江北之年景及北方一帶其收成之佳均又超過預算之外所以大部份人心均自然轉動目下所不致急轉直下者徒爲一部份廠家所擯住耳結果本月份較前日小二厘半七月份又一錢進關較小七厘半八月份小五厘九·十月份小二厘半十一月份小七厘半云</p>
<h3>麥市疲憊不振</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面上下午開盤後各月份市面均轉疲滯不振之態以洋麥報價又見續小業外之多頭心思不免活動至就國内之近况而言照歷年之廠家態度對於新麥大致均踴躍收辦無如多數廠家均有洋麥爲準備各地之新貨以天時之順遂均逐步裝申有此情形多頭之預算似根本上已連受重大之打擊各盤之逐步鬆動殆全爲事實上所擯落也結果本月份較前日跌三分七月份小二分八月份未動九·</p>

<h3>遂安珍眉銷暢跌</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市來路莊之遂安珍眉綠茶英莊協和·天祥等行因華商索價較前鬆動進意轉趨殷濃市上該路珍眉業已銷售無幾但市盤定出一百十五兩較前見跌一二十兩屯溪婺源珍眉行家雖多有談判然交易並不暢旺平水大帮美銷業已發動惟多數均係零星拆售蓋因珠茶銷路頗佳而針秀眉等貨美銷不振扯價不合故也</p>
<h3>屯溪新茶供不敷求</h3>
<p>屯溪茶號今歲因各路茶産蝕收新茶運屯出售者絕無僅有兼之出秤稍遲婺源東北新茶均被本處茶號搶辦殆盡先後赴婺辦茶者均抱向隅休屬昆連歙縣一帶新茶因店莊銷暢價高紛紛改製青茶休南新茶多患虫害大告欠收贛茶爲匪患被阻故屯號進茶數量大半尙未滿額仍在派夥四出搜求云</p>

<h3>五金我白鐵皮定價向疲</h3>
<p>白鐵皮海外定價屢報下游致本埠同業心思萎靡所以後批購定者十分尠少聞昨日倍爾城來電又跌落五先令計每噸祇售十六鎊五先令但本埠同業之購定者仍覺寥若晨星云</p>
<h3>青鉛趨勢萎靡</h3>
<p>青鉛趨勢因海外定價跌落故本埠標準亦隨之下游最　價每擔祇售十五兩七錢半比前跌落二錢半但目下茶帮停辦油漆公司客帮等點綴不廣是以人心衰弱市氣空虚故來市行情頗有絡繹趨軟之象云</p>

<p>Nanjing. Chairman Chiang, due to the rampant activities of the Red bandits in Hunan and Jiangxi, decided to personally go west to oversee the suppression. During his absence from the capital, he emphasized that the affairs of the central government must rely on the joint efforts of colleagues in the government. In addition to hosting a banquet for all members of the Legislative Yuan a few days ago, he hosted a special banquet at the Lishi Society on the 10th for all members of the Control Yuan and military councilors of all ranks from the Military Council, with Xiong Shihui, Gao Lingbai, and others as guests. During the banquet, Chiang delivered a speech stating that he would soon be going to Jiangxi to suppress the Red bandits and would not be able to attend to administrative affairs concurrently. He hoped that his colleagues in the National Government would share the responsibility and strive to complete the construction during the period of political tutelage to meet the expectations of the people. Yu Youren responded by saying that during this period of political tutelage, the government had numerous construction projects to undertake, but the chaos caused by the Red bandits in Hunan and Hubei, which prevented the end of military operations, was regrettable. The incessant military activities at the front were significantly impacting the government's administration. He hoped that Chairman Chiang's personal oversight of the suppression of the Red bandits would soon lead to their demise and a return to peace for the people. Zhang Jinghui responded by saying that the Control Yuan had not been established for long, and its organization was not yet fully in place. He hoped that the Chairman and colleagues would not hesitate to provide guidance and that he himself planned to go north for a trip in the coming days and would soon return south to carry out the intentions of the National Government and work hard to make progress. The guests and hosts dispersed after 2:00 PM. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Reply to Chiang</h3>
<p>Following Orders and Leading Troops</p>
<p>Nanjing. Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Chairman Chiang on the 8th, saying, "Having read your esteemed (6th) You Dian, I respectfully appreciate your undertaking the campaign in Jiangxi and suppressing the bandits. You have clarified the great righteousness to all officers and soldiers, and your kind teachings are earnest. Your profound concern for the country is clearly evident. Not only are the soldiers rising up with the common goal of fighting the enemy, but also the people who live on this land are hoping for relief like the arrival of clouds and rainbows. I repeatedly read your message with great respect and admiration. It is my belief that the Republic of China has been founded for twenty years, and construction has just begun, but disasters are still frequent. The suffering of the people has not been alleviated, and the complete success of the revolution has not been achieved. Unless internal strife is eliminated, unity cannot be guaranteed. Unless the Red bandits are suppressed, society cannot be stabilized, and the people cannot be pacified and the country established. There is no other way. All military personnel should strive together. Your Excellency has the talent of both literary and martial skills and is responsible for the arduous task entrusted by the predecessors. Your plans and strategies are admired by the whole country. This time, you personally lead the troops and vow to clear the stubborn bandits. Your prestige will spread, and the grass will bend to the wind. I, Xueliang, am entrusted with an important mission and will exert my strength in military affairs. I respectfully ask for your detailed instructions and hope to follow them to eliminate the bandits. I have carefully conveyed your instructions to my subordinates and will respectfully follow your orders, leading the troops. I respectfully present this telegram and ask for your examination."

<h3>Complex Internal Situation in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Financial Difficulties, Insufficient Military Expenses</p>
<p>Nanjing. A person from Guangdong said that after the establishment of the puppet government in Guangdong, no one at home or abroad responded. The internal situation is complex, with factions on the left and right, elders, the Western Hills faction, and the Sun Ke faction, with the Gu faction being the most dominant, followed by the Sun faction. Gu and Chen wanted to control the situation in Guangdong, but the Wang Jingwei faction strongly opposed them. Xu Chongzhi was controlled by Zhang Guigui. Zhang Guigui and Chen joined hands to seek military supplies and used each other temporarily. Guangdong's finances are in dire straits, with gambling and miscellaneous taxes only bringing in five million per month. The Guangdong military expenses require six million. Chen's military subsidy is also taken from this. If war breaks out, tax revenues will be even shorter, and it will be even more difficult to support the increased military expenses.

<h3>British Prime Minister Visits Germany, US Secretary of State Visits Europe</h3>
<p>Although there was no clear result regarding the issues of war debts and reparations after the recent visit of German dignitaries to the UK, the close friendship between the two countries has created an opportunity to resolve the European crisis. Today, as the German Prime Minister and Foreign Minister leave the UK, British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Henderson have accepted Germany's invitation and are preparing to reciprocate the visit. US Secretary of State Stimson is also scheduled to visit European countries at the end of this month, including Germany, the UK, Italy, and France. According to the World News Agency, the US Secretary of State's visit to Europe is not only about economic issues but also out of fear that the disarmament conference is on the verge of failure and that he wants to present the US's views to mediate. Recently, the international situation is indeed in danger of breaking down, such as the naval agreement issue, where the opinions between France and Italy are not yet satisfactory, and the German-Austrian tax treaty issue, which is still in stalemate with France. The war debt issue, with the United States as the main party, has not yet had a clear expression, and the reparations issue, with France as the main party, has also not expressed any opinions. All of these issues are closely related to the future of world peace, and countries such as the UK, the US, Germany, and France are at the heart of each issue. Now that the visits of UK dignitaries to Germany and US dignitaries to Europe have been decided, if French Foreign Minister Briand also makes a trip, then diplomatic relations will be even more consolidated, and the resolution of all difficult issues will be even more hopeful.</p>

<p>Italian Government's Response to the Vatican's Diplomatic Note:</p>
<p>No Intention to Apologize</p>
<p>Anti-Church Actions Still Not Ceasing</p>
<p>Rome, 10th (National News Agency): The Italian government has responded to the Vatican's diplomatic note. It has only explained the anti-church actions without offering an apology. The Vatican has not yet issued any formal or semi-official statement on this matter, and even its official newspaper has made no comment. However, many believe that the Italian reply, although worded politely, is hardly satisfactory. It is also reported that there have been new attacks on church buildings near Rome, destroying their gates.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Accept Invitation to Visit Germany</p>
<p>German Officials Leave England and Return Home</p>
<p>The U.S. Has Long Denied Offering Concessions on War Debts</p>
<p>Stimson's Visit to Europe is Related to the Disarmament Issue</p>
<p>London, 9th (Reuters): German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius left England and returned home today on the British destroyer Winchester from Southampton, where they transferred to the German ship Europa to return to Germany. On the eve of his departure, Brüning expressed his belief that his talks with British officials would greatly contribute to international cooperation. British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Henderson have accepted an invitation to visit Germany, but the date has not been set. Upon boarding the ship, Brüning telegraphed the British Prime Minister to thank him for his hospitality and the warm welcome from the British government and people. Curtius also telegraphed Henderson to thank him, and the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary replied with telegrams. Europa was delayed due to fog, so the German Chancellor did not board the ship until 1:00 PM before departing for Germany.</p>
<p>Washington, 9th (National News Agency): According to reports from London, the British government formally announced today that Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Henderson will travel to Berlin in return for the visit. The details of the Anglo-German talks are not yet known here, but it is reported that the informal reports published in a certain newspaper yesterday are largely accurate, indicating that they are not far from what the US government had anticipated. Furthermore, the statement made by the British that the United States holds the key to the war debt and reparations issue is acknowledged here as fact from one perspective, but the US government's attitude, while holding the key, is still unable to open the door to the revitalization of the world's economy and finance. Well-informed sources here do not believe that the European powers will directly negotiate with the US government at this time, but rather will first engage in informal contacts with the US ambassadors to England and Germany. They also anticipate that the Anglo-German talks will not lead to an early revision of the Young Plan, as it will take several weeks for the European countries to agree on all the practical procedures, which cannot be achieved in one fell swoop. The United States is willing to participate in any conscious movement to improve the world's economic situation, but the US government's attitude on the issue of reducing war debts remains unchanged as announced by the President at the International Chamber of Commerce. However, the Young Plan has inherent flexibility and contains provisions for providing temporary relief to the Germans.</p>
<p>Washington: US Secretary of State Stimson is scheduled to visit Italy, France, Germany and England at the end of this month. This trip is highly significant due to its connection with next year's disarmament conference. Although officially described as a vacation trip, Stimson's meetings with Mussolini, Briand, MacDonald, and others will frankly explain the US's views on the fears of a failed disarmament conference. Furthermore, the US government recognizes that the Franco-Italian naval agreement is necessary for world peace and economic stability, and Stimson will undoubtedly strive for this. During this trip, he will have the opportunity to explain the US's attitude on issues such as war debts and tariffs, and he will gain a thorough knowledge of the political and economic conditions in Europe before returning home (World).</p>
<p>Paris, 9th (National Telegram): French Foreign Minister Briand made a statement on the Anglo-German conversations, saying that Germany may have detailed its economic difficulties during the meeting, but the modification of the Young Plan is out of the question, as Germany has other ways to save itself according to the Young Plan, and there is no need to change the original text of the plan.</p>
<p>Paris, 9th (National News Agency): Parisian evening newspapers today claimed that a portion of the ancillary conditions of Germany's reparations under the Young Plan will be temporarily suspended, and that a new reparations conference will be convened in Brussels or Basel in August or September. The attitude of Parisian public opinion towards changes in the German reparations issue seems to have a considerable degree of understanding and concession. The Parisian newspaper Midi stated that the suspension of German reparations is not significantly related to the French budget or the future of the Young Plan securities, because if Germany ceases to pay France's reparations, France can cease to pay its war debts to the United States.</p>
<p>All-India Working Committee Meeting: Conflicts Among Nationalities</p>
<p>Order Disrupted</p>
<p>Bombay, 10th (Reuters): The turbulent national atmosphere in India, referred to in the recent correspondence between British Prime Minister MacDonald and Conservative Party leader Baldwin, was witnessed at the important meeting of the All-India National Congress Working Committee. The meeting was held in a Muslim-populated area of Bombay, and Gandhi attended. Important figures successively spoke, aiming to gain Muslim support for the Congress' work and the Delhi Agreement. However, for some unknown reason, a major conflict suddenly broke out between Muslims and Parsis (an Afghan ethnic group residing in India), causing the meeting to break up without a result. There were no major casualties on either side, but order was disrupted. The police dispersed the mob before order was restored.</p>
<p>International Labour Conference Closes:</p>

<p>Geneva, 9th (National News Agency): The International Labour Conference closed today. International Labour Office Director Thomas gave a pessimistic speech, saying that the International Labour Office could not solve the current global economic hardship because the scope of the issues dealt with by the International Labour Office itself is limited. The representatives of labor and management at this conference were unable to reach a consensus, so the result can be said to be zero, which is very regrettable.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Shao Lizhi's Mission to Shandong</h3>
<p>Negotiate with Han and Ma Regarding the Military Funds of Shi's Troops</p>
<p>Monthly Increase of 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Han Conveys Central Government's Intentions to Shi</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Central Committee member Shao Lizhi recently came to Shandong from Beijing. It is reported that his mission is to resolve the issue of military funds for Shi Yousan's troops. When Zhang Xueliang was in Beijing last month, he discussed this with Chairman Chiang. The Central Government agreed to fully maintain Shi's troops' funding, but fearing that there might still be some misunderstanding, Shao Lizhi was specially dispatched to Shandong to negotiate with Han Fuju and Ma Hongkui at length. This is because Han and Ma have been comrades-in-arms with Shi for many years, and Shi has always respected Han as his elder brother, so Han should be able to achieve satisfactory results. It is reported that Han and Ma have already telegraphed Shi Yousan to convey the Central Government's intentions, with extremely earnest wording. The general idea is to hope that Shi will thoroughly uphold his original intention of supporting peace and unification and not believe the rumors of anyone. It is reported that Shao Lizhi will only return to Beijing to report after Shi Yousan's reply telegram arrives (6th).</p>
<h3>Forced Excavation of Farmland by Koreans in Changchun: Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Leaders Have Been Detained and Sent to the Japanese Consulate for Legal Action</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: The Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office reported that in Wanbaoshan area of Xiang 3rd district, Changchun County, a large group of Koreans, about 200, and many Chinese laborers hired from outside, were forcibly digging up farmland and diverting the water of the Yitong River. The Public Security Bureau ordered them to stop work, but they refused to comply. Furthermore, more than 200 households of affected landlords reported to the office, stating that the Koreans were digging ditches about three zhang wide and within three zhang deep, about twenty-odd li long. The ditch work was being carried out vigorously and was almost completed, damaging more than one hundred qing of good farmland. In the future, if the canal is completed, in years of heavy rain, more than two thousand qing of nearby good farmland will inevitably be affected by water damage. The Changchun County Government first arrested Hao Yongde, who recruited the Koreans, for investigation, and then reported to the Provincial Government, which telegraphed an order to implement the prohibition of digging ditches and ordered them to disband. Subsequently, Shen Yongjun, Li Fushu, Jin Longzhu, Cui Xiangji, Zhu Rixing, and Li Xitai, representing more than one hundred Koreans, made a statement to the County Public Security Bureau on May 31st, claiming that they were willing to stop work and all return to Changchun within two days. However, on June 1st, they reversed their previous agreement and claimed that they could not stop work or leave the country even if they died. The Public Security Bureau selectively sent Shen Yongjun, Li Fushu, Jin Longzhu, Cui Xiangji, Li Xitai, Jin Taijun, Sun Binghao, Li Xiangyang, Jiang Rirong,</p>
<p>Park Seong-ryong, and other ten people to the county for interrogation. They claimed that all of the ditch digging work was done by people who cultivated rice fields, among whom the ringleaders were Li Chang, Park No-seong, Jeong Tae-ok, Li De-rui, Seo Ryong-un,</p>
<p>Li Jo-hwa, Kim Dong-seon, Shim Hyung-taek, and Jeong Won-taek, nine people who all lived in Toutaogou. The route of the ditch was instructed to be dug by these ringleaders. After the government intervened and stopped it, the ringleaders claimed that the land occupied along the route of the ditch had already been rented and could not be stopped, so they continued to work. While the Changchun County Government was investigating, it was reported that there were more than one hundred Koreans still working, refusing to comply with the prohibition. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to continue sending police teams to order them to disband, the ten people, including Shen Yongjun, who were brought to the city were sent to the office for interrogation, and a serious negotiation was requested to severely punish Li Xichang and other nine people who incited the forceful occupation of the people's land and the hard digging of ditches according to law, in order to calm the public anger. Regarding the damages of all the affected landlords, once verified, a request will be made to transfer them for compensation according to the number. The Municipal Office believes that Koreans renting rice fields must go through the procedure of being permitted by the government. Hao Yongde rented the people's land in Wanbaoshan of Xiang 3rd district of Changchun County to open up rice fields without formally going through the approval procedures, and Li Xichang and other nine people who colluded secretly actually incited a large group of Koreans to forcibly dig up neighboring fields for a length of more than twenty li, which will damage more than two thousand qing of nearby people's fields in the future. When the government stopped them, they dared to ignore the law, which is truly disregarding the law. Therefore, on the 3rd of this month, a letter was prepared to send the ten people, including Shen Yongjun, to the Japanese Consulate in Changchun for investigation and handling, and it was requested that all the main perpetrators of the instigation be severely punished according to law to quell the public anger. All the losses of the people will be investigated and then transferred for handling (June 5th).</p>

<h3>Jin Province Implements Reorganization of Provincial Currency</h3>
<p>Gao Buqing Announces Reorganization Measures</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since the Shanxi Provincial Government announced various reorganization measures regarding financial issues, the surface seems to be gradually moving towards a solution, but in reality, it is still difficult to achieve considerable development. Over the past few days, market transactions and cash exchange have still been chaotic. The Money Dealers Association specially held a meeting yesterday to study measures, and there was much discussion about the Provincial Government's provision that each yuan of provincial currency should be exchanged for four jiao in cash. The majority still advocated following the natural trend of the market and letting it rise and fall. The general public believes that the measures set by the Provincial Government this time are biased towards the government's side. Gao Buqing, the newly appointed Director of the Provincial Bank, took office yesterday and announced the reorganization plan to the press at the bank this afternoon. The established measures include: (1) Reorganizing the internal affairs; (2) Issuing convertible banknotes; (3) Attracting more commercial shares; (4) Convening representatives of commercial associations from various counties to discuss and promote convertible banknotes; (5) Organizing a strong board of directors. The provincial bank, which has been in a state of no one in charge for a long time, now has someone responsible, and the future prospects of the provincial currency may have considerable hope. Furthermore, all tax collection agencies in the province have been implementing cash collection according to the new regulations since yesterday (June 6th).</p>
<h3>Record of Investigation into the Jingxing Coal Mine, Hebei</h3>
<p>Mining operations have been limited to transportation constraints for over thirty years.</p>
<p>After assuming office, Fu Shuangying is determined to make efforts to rectify the situation.</p>
<p>The by-products of the coking plant are excellent, and future development is promising.</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Ever since the Kailuan and Beining Railways had a dispute over freight rates, the Chinese people have become aware of the importance of Kailuan coal in the two major industrial areas of Tianjin and Shanghai. The mine produces 20,000 tons of coal per day, of which 15,000 to 16,000 tons are transported and sold to Tianjin and Shanghai, and about 4,000 to 5,000 tons are sold along the Beining Railway. For nearly a month, Kailuan has been unable to ship coal to Shanghai. According to Qian Chengxu, the representative of the National Federation of Commerce, Japanese Fushun coal has seized the opportunity to invade Shanghai, and coal prices have been rising daily, severely impacting the industrial sector. Although state-owned coal companies such as Lu Da, Lincheng, and Beipiao have sales offices in Shanghai and their coal quality is good and prices are low, unfortunately, due to weak transportation capacity, they cannot meet the needs of the industrial sector. In times of military conflict, coal from Lu Da and Lincheng will disappear from Shanghai. Previously, companies such as Jingxing, Zhengfeng, Yili, and Liuhegou were unable to reach Shanghai due to transportation difficulties. Therefore, it is hoped that the Ministry of Railways will encourage domestic coal, reduce freight rates, and provide sufficient vehicles to gradually expand sales. This is indeed the truth. Yesterday, I visited Fu Shuangying, the director of the Jingxing Mining Bureau, who stated that the Jingxing Mine has complete equipment and is of a grand scale, perhaps unparalleled among state-owned coal enterprises. In terms of machinery power, it can produce more than 10,000 tons of coal per day, but due to transportation bottlenecks, it only produces a few thousand tons daily. Additionally, the coking plant produces 100 tons of coke per day, with more than 20 kinds of by-products, which is also unique among state-owned coal enterprises. The quality of Jingxing coal is superior to that of Kailuan and is recognized by users (Jingxing coal has strong heating power, durability, and low ash content; 70 catties are equivalent to 100 catties of Kailuan coal). The reason why it cannot compete with Kailuan is due to transportation limitations. Kailuan has more than 600 coal cars, while Jingxing only has 150, which are also limited by their narrow gauge, only able to operate between the mining area and Nanhetou, and unable to run on the Zhengtai Railway Line. Ten years ago, Jingxing coal could be sold along the entire Pinghan Railway Line. Subsequently, wars disrupted transportation every year. In recent years, Jingxing coal can only be sold in Shijiazhuang, Beiping, and Tianjin. However, even within this small sales market, it would not be difficult to sell 10,000 tons per day if transportation were convenient. Currently, the Pinghan Railway only provides two coal trains, and the Beining Railway provides three. Therefore, only a few tens of thousands of tons of coal were transported to Tianjin last month, which could not meet the demand. After I took office, I made efforts to rectify the situation. I recently convened a bureau affairs meeting, and established measures for eliminating redundant personnel, increasing production, increasing transport volume, and saving expenses. Currently, two locomotives have been added, and the Pinghan Railway has been requested to allocate two more coal trains. The by-products produced by the mine's coking plant are all important industrial products. The motor oil used in our country is all imported. The motor oil produced by the mine's coking plant is slightly smoky when burned due to poor machinery and impure filtration, and can only be used for long-distance buses, and is sold at a particularly low price. I have decided to expand the coking plant and purchase new machinery to filter pure motor oil for use. The mine is run by the government, and the director often changes with the political situation, so the business cannot be fully developed, but there is still an annual surplus. From the 8th to the 18th year of the Republic of China, the mine's income was mostly allocated to military expenses due to repeated military conflicts, which nearly bankrupted the mine. I am determined to rectify the mine, and I will work diligently to develop the mine with any surplus, and will not divert it for other purposes. This matter has been explained to Chairman Wang of Hebei Province and Deputy Commander Zhang. I cannot guarantee that it will be successful in the future, but I will do my best while in office. Recently, the Pinghan Railway increased freight rates by 15%, which increased the cost of transporting coal to Tianjin, requiring a price increase of five dimes per ton, which hindered sales. I have sent Wang Jingchun, the director of general affairs, to Hankou to negotiate with the Pinghan Railway Bureau, requesting them to maintain support for state-owned coal enterprises, reduce freight rates, and allocate more vehicles to facilitate transportation. The Jingxing Mine has a history of over 30 years since its establishment, but few people know about it. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Initial Trial Period: In the first month of the 24th year of Guangxu, Zhang Fengqi of Jingxing County purchased 18 mu of land in Hexi Village from the Ma family as a mining area, stating the reasons for mining and submitting them to the county government for transfer to the Zhili Governor-General's Office for approval. In May of that year, he started construction using local methods, but due to insufficient capital, it was unsuccessful and work was stopped. Zhang was not discouraged by the failure and decided to continue mining with foreign investment. The following year, he signed a contract with the German Hannaghen for a trial operation and reported it through the German Consul-General in Tianjin and the Jingxing County to the Zhili Governor-General's Office, but it was rejected by Yuan Shikai, the Minister of Beiyang, who feared that foreign investment would contain economic aggression. Zhang continued to struggle and in the 28th year, he finally received approval to send personnel to survey the coal seams and report on them. In the 29th year, it was found that the coal seams in Hexi Village were very rich. Zhang, in the name of the Jingxing County Coal Mining Bureau, and the German, in the name of the Hannaghen Company, signed a contract. Hannaghen invested 50,000 taels of silver and Zhang provided 18 mu of land, with the mining area within ten miles of Hexi Village. Both parties jointly managed the mining rights, and 5% of the value of the coal mined each day was paid as tax. Each year, 25% of the surplus was reported to the Road Mining General Bureau. After deducting taxes, reports, savings, and all expenses, all remaining profits were distributed to the landowners and shareholders. At that time, a contract diagram was attached to request the Road Mining General Bureau to issue a license for formal operation. Before long, Hannaghen returned to Germany due to business matters, and coal mining could not be actively carried out. In the 32nd year, Yuan Shikai commissioned Liang Dunyan of the Tianjin Customs to find a way to take it over for government management. Liang purchased Zhang Fengqi's mining land and cancelled his mining rights, and revised the contract with Hannaghen to a Sino-German government-business joint venture, named the Jingxing Mining General Bureau. Liang served as the director, Hannaghen as the general manager, hired miners, purchased machinery, and engaged in layout, and hired Eckert as the chief foreman. In November of the 29th year, the first groundbreaking ceremony was held to excavate the South Well (i.e., Well No. 1), install coal hoists and pumps, 17 large and small boilers, and build underground railways. Coal was produced in June of the 30th year. In August of the 31st year, the first groundbreaking ceremony for the North Well (i.e., Well No. 2) was held. At this time, the South Well had been dug to a depth of over 30 feet.</p>
<p>Sino-German Joint Venture Period: After Liang Dunyan bought the mining rights and revised the contract with Hannaghen, he requested approval in April of the 34th year. The Hannaghen Company (i.e., the Jingxing Company) valued the machinery and mining projects it had built as company equity of 250,000 taels. The coal produced in Jingxing County was valued as mining bureau equity of 250,000 taels, totaling 500,000 taels. If the equity was insufficient in the future, both parties would increase the equity equally. Under the director, China and Germany each sent a general manager, and the rest of the important staff were half Chinese and half foreign. Official documents were in both English and Chinese. The annual accounts were first paid with 7% interest, and the remaining funds were deposited in the bank as a fund for returning the equity. 5,000 taels were allocated from the remaining profits to report to the Zhili Mining Administration Investigation Bureau. Any remaining profits were divided equally between the two parties. The contract was valid for 30 years, but from the 21st to the 30th year, the Jingxing Company received 40% of the mining profits, and the bureau received 60%. From the 16th to the 30th year, the Mining Bureau should repay the Jingxing Company for the capital actually used at a rate of one-fifteenth per year until the debt was paid off, after which the contract would be void. Taxes were reported at a price of one tael per ton based on the value of the coal mined, with five cents being reported as tax. In addition, eighty-four cash coins were paid per ton as a tariff, and another one mace and two and a half li were paid as tax silver, with no other taxes. In the 34th year of Guangxu, Cai Shaoji, the Minister of Beiyang and Governor-General of Zhili, appointed Cai Shaoji as the director and Li Deshun and Hannaghen as the general managers. In the 3rd year of Xuantong, bonds worth 750,000 taels were issued, secured by mining products, but only 285,800 taels were sold, and the remaining tickets were burned. From the 1st year of Xuantong to the 6th year of the Republic of China, the average annual coal production was 300,000 tons. In the 7th year of the Republic of China, materials worth more than 460,000 yuan were purchased, and 600,000 tons of coal were produced in that year. However, after August of the 6th year of the Republic of China, due to the declaration of war against Germany, all treaties and contracts between China and Germany were invalidated in accordance with international law and practice. The Mining Bureau immediately reduced foreign staff and cancelled the title of Foreign General Manager of Hannaghen, rehiring him as a specialist in engineering management. The rules of procedure were revised, and staff members were required to consult with the General Manager before taking action. Hannaghen left his post in October of the 7th year of the Republic of China, and the remaining foreign staff were sent back to their countries in batches. All mining rights were managed by our country. However, the various losses due to the dismissal of foreign staff amounted to 500,000 yuan. At that time, Japanese capitalists wanted to take over Kailuan, and the British also lobbied to take over. Although negotiations were frequent, they did not materialize, and the economic aggression policy of the powers was alarming.</p>
<p>Provincial and Ministerial Joint Venture Period: After the declaration of war against Germany, our government promulgated regulations for the management of German people's property and the handling of German mining merchants. During this period, the Mining Bureau had a direct relationship with the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. In December of the 7th year of the Republic of China, the province sent Xu Shigang as the general manager, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce added Xing Duan, the director of the Mining Administration Department, as the general manager. In March of the 8th year of the Republic of China, the Bureau for the Management of Enemy People's Property under the three ministries of agriculture, commerce, foreign affairs, and finance, and the Zhili Provincial Office each sent a member to form the Jingxing Mining Bureau Liquidation Committee. It was not until the 10th year of the Republic of China that Hannaghen sent Paul, a plenipotentiary representative, to Tianjin to negotiate the revision of the contract. In October of the 11th year of the Republic of China, the revised contract was established, stipulating that the Jingxing Mine was the property of Zhili Province. Half of the original equity and property of the Jingxing Company was transferred to Zhili Province. The Jingxing Company only retained the original equity of 125,000 taels of silver, which was one-quarter of the total equity of 500,000 taels of silver. The profits from subsequent operations were distributed accordingly. The total value of the Mining Bureau's property was estimated at 4.5 million yuan, and the ownership of both parties was determined according to the principle of three-quarters and one-quarter. At the same time, the system was changed to a director system. This revised contract was valid for 20 years, after which all mining properties would belong to Zhili Province without any further rights to the Jingxing Company. From the 8th to the 13th year of the Republic of China, materials worth more than 750,000 yuan were purchased. In the 11th year of the Republic of China, 600,000 tons of coal were produced. In the 12th year, Xu Shigang handed over his post to Chen Guodong. In the 13th year, Zhao Yuke took over. In the 14th year, Yang Yunfeng took over. Within the 15th year, Guo Zongdao, Hu Keli, Ma Hongliang, and Liu Gengxun successively took over. In the 17th year, the National Revolutionary Army succeeded in the Northern Expedition, and Wang Xiang, the chairman of the Hebei Provincial Commercial and Agricultural Committee, was appointed as the director, and Zhang Lange and Paul were appointed as the deputy directors. In the 19th year, Yan Xishan failed, and Wang Shuchang was appointed as the chairman of the province and also served as the director. Gao Shangzhi was appointed as the deputy director. In April of this year, Wang was too busy with provincial affairs to兼任 his post, and requested Zhang Xueliang to resign his position, and Zhang appointed Fu Shuangying, the former supervisor of the Shenyang Customs, to succeed him.</p>
<p>Rich Coal Reserves in the Mining Area: The Jingxing Mine was acquired in a Sino-German government-business joint venture. In the 8th year of the Republic of China, another 2,274 mu and 7 li were purchased, totaling 34 square li, 114 mu, and 7 li. The amount of coal stored underground is more than 110 million tons. Since mining began, less than 10 million tons have been mined. The first layer of coal is 9 centimeters to 1.2 meters thick, with solid sandstone on the top and bottom. The second layer of coal is 2.4 meters thick, with a layer of sandy shale on the top and bottom, which is also solid. The third layer of coal is only 6 centimeters thick, so it has not been mined. The fourth layer of coal is 2.4 meters thick, with limestone on the top and fine sandstone on the bottom, which are both solid. This layer is the best quality coal in the Jing Mine. The fifth layer of coal is 7.5 meters thick and is the main coal layer in the Jing Mine. The roof is black shale, which is the easiest to break. When mining, the roof stone falls before the coal can be extracted, often injuring workers and requiring more wooden pillars. This is its disadvantage. The first and second layers are 5.2 meters apart, the second and third layers are 13.3 meters apart, the third and fourth layers are 21.5 meters apart, and the fourth and fifth layers are 15.5 meters apart. The depth from the ground level to the fifth layer of coal ranges from 180 meters to 250 meters. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Organization and Current Situation of the Jiangxi Bandit Kong Hechong</h3>
<p>Report of a Coerced Person Surrendering</p>
<p>Pseudo-Soviets Spread Throughout the Border of Hunan and Jiangxi</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Red bandit pseudo-16th Army, led by Kong Hechong, along with his pseudo-7th, 8th, and 9th Divisions, have been causing disturbances in the counties of Pingjiang, Liuyang, Tongshan, Xiushui, Tonggu, and Wanzai on the border of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi for several years. Recently, Leng Zongfan, who was forced to join the gang, was involved in an AB group plot to riot within the bandit ranks. After the incident was exposed, he escaped and surrendered to the garrison in Tonggu. According to his detailed account of the organization and current situation of the Red bandits, the main points are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>The Xiushui Pseudo-Soviet Government in the Zhajin and Zhuxi areas has three pistols, four rows of bullets, and over a hundred rifles, with over a hundred damaged ones and four or five rows of bullets. They are divided into three squads and were allocated by the pseudo-16th Army after they attacked Tongcheng. The responsible persons for the organization of the Soviet in this county are Chairman Fan Shengfa and Yu Chuicheng (i.e., Wu Tianji, currently the director of the pseudo-Political Department of the 16th Army). The responsible person for the Tonggu County Soviet in Paibu is unknown. According to Village Chairman Shi of the village under its jurisdiction, there are currently only about twenty guns and three or four rows of bullets. The Hunan Provincial Soviet in Dongmen has forty guns. The Pingjiang County Soviet in Xujiadong has eighty guns. The Liuyang County Soviet in Guanyintang has twenty guns, one pistol, and no more than four rows of bullets. The responsible personnel are unknown. The number of guns in the Tongcheng County Soviet in Shimaoyuan and Kuzhuling is unknown.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the bandit army is currently in Baisha, Liuyang. The bandit army commander, Kong Hechong, is in his forties, bald, with a dark face and a wide forehead. The director of military and political affairs, Wang Zhaolin, is of unknown appearance. The headquarters has about a hundred guns and over ten Mauser pistols, with no more than five rows of bullets each. The bandit army is organized without a camp headquarters and is divided into three divisions. Gao Yongsheng, the commander of the 7th Division, is from Pingjiang, in his twenties, with a white face. He has over a hundred guns, over two hundred damaged guns, four or five rows of bullets, five machine guns (three damaged), two rows of bullets, one submachine gun with several rows of bullets, and over ten Mauser pistols, each with three or four rows of bullets, and four mortars (buried in Huangjindong due to lack of bullets). The political commissar, Zou Zhimou, is from Pingjiang.</p>
<p>He has a wide face with a pointy chin, bald head, short stature, and is in his twenties. The bandit army is currently rampaging in the Pingjiang area. The commander of the 8th Division is unknown. The political commissar, Zhang Sijing, revolted on March 28, but was exposed by Li Yuanqing and was taken into custody and sent to the Hunan Provincial Soviet for interrogation. The division has over six hundred guns, over two hundred damaged ones, and three, four, or five rows of bullets. It is entrenched in Zhajin, Xiushui. Yu Gen, the commander of the 9th Division, is from Pingjiang, in his thirties, blind in one eye, and always wears black glasses. The director of political affairs, Li Youjun, is thin and has a face like a monkey with a high nose. He has over eight hundred guns, four or five rows of bullets, two machine guns (less than two belts of bullets), and ten Mauser pistols with five or six rows of bullets. It is currently entrenched in Huangmao, Wanzai. Peng Dehuai of the 5th Bandit Army and Huang Gonglue of the 8th Army are both downstream of Ganzhou. It is said that the Peng bandits sent 300 bandits to escort 30,000 yuan of bandit recruitment silver to the Kong bandits, ordering Kong to recruit bandits in Ping, Liu, Tong, and Wan, reaching thousands. The bandit army now plans to use one division as a unit to flee towards Yifeng and Wanzai, and adopt a strategy of raiding teams and companies to seize guns and bullets. They will take a hidden approach when encountering a regiment or more of the National Army. (May 7)</p>
<h3>Lu Construction Department Organizes Thousand Buddha Mountain</h3>
<p>The project is divided into three parts and requires 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Thousand Buddha Mountain, located five li south of Jinan City, has many scenic spots and historical sites. The Construction Department recently sent several technicians to conduct a survey for organization. The survey has been completed, and the department is preparing an organization plan and a budget statement for the project to submit to the provincial government for review. Once approved and funds are raised, the organization will begin to preserve the scenic spots. The plan and statement are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Thousand Buddha Mountain Organization Plan: (1) Building roads: The four or five li of dirt road from outside the Nanweimen to the foot of the mountain varies in width and is uneven. It is planned to fill and level the original roadbed, widen the narrow sections, and leave tree bases on both sides in preparation for planting trees. (2) Repairing temples: The old temples on the mountainside have been dilapidated due to years of disrepair and are half-destroyed. It is planned to raise funds and hire workers to thoroughly repair them so that the solemn appearance of the temples can be restored to its former glory. Subsequently, it is planned to gradually add houses to set up a natural sanatorium and summer villas for Chinese and foreign people to rest and recuperate. (3) Preservation of stone carvings: There are many statues carved on the mountain rocks throughout history, which have historical and artistic value. Many have been lost due to wind and rain erosion and bandit damage. It is planned to thoroughly preserve the existing ones to preserve the historical sites. (4) Digging water wells: The mountain has deep water springs, and it is difficult to dig wells. Daily drinking water must be taken from the city or several miles away, and the lack of water sources is a shortcoming. It is planned to hire well-digging experts to survey the terrain at the foot of the mountain and dig a well for easy access to water for irrigation and drinking. (5) Planting trees: It is planned to divide Thousand Buddha Mountain into tree-planting areas for various government agencies and schools under the provincial government. Tree planting will be held every spring, and the department will be responsible for preparing and purchasing various tree seedlings for various agencies and schools to implement tree planting in order to form a forest after ten years. (6) Improving the Pan Road on the East Mountain: The stone slabs on the Pan Road on the East Mountain are flat, and pedestrians often slip and fall. It is planned to stagger the stone slabs slightly and build a pavilion in the middle of the road for tourists to rest and catch their breath.</p>
<p>Project Statement and Budget: (1) The original road from Nanweimen to Thousand Buddha Mountain is 4 to 5 meters wide, and it is uniformly widened to 8 meters. A ditch 20 centimeters deep and 50 centimeters wide is left outside, and a 45-degree slope is created outside to plant reeds. A flat area 2 meters wide is left on the land for planting trees. A 3-meter area west of the south side of the Disabled Soldiers' Home to the foot of the mountain is left for planting trees. A slope is built on the east side to plant grass. The easternmost side is a ditch, and a 2-meter area outside the ditch is also left for planting trees. There is a convex natural stone at the southernmost end, which is blasted away and filled with yellow soil to match the previous road construction method.</p>
<p>Total: 3,168 yuan. (2) The original road from Nanweimen to the foot of the mountain is 1,710 meters long and 5 meters wide on average. It is planned to convert the road into a stone slab road, widening the original road to 6 meters and building a roadbed so that the road crown is 15 centimeters higher than the inlet line. Then, it is rolled and compacted, using a mixture of one part lime and three parts soil to glue the road surface stone slabs and border stones. The road edge is lined with road tooth stones. After paving, a meter of space is left outside each road tooth stone for planting trees. The project is estimated to cost 35,317 yuan. (3) East Pan Road Project: The East Pan Road from the lower end to the monastery is originally 4 meters high, 270 meters long, and 13 meters wide. It is now being converted into a terraced Pan Road with a width of 2 meters. Random stone retaining walls are added on both sides. A total of 400 steps are built from bottom to top. The step strips are 1 meter long, 40 centimeters wide, and 12 centimeters thick. A platform is built every four steps. A gap is left in the middle of the east retaining wall to allow access to the sanatorium in the future. The project is estimated to cost 3,083 yuan and 4 jiao. (4) Repairing Thousand Buddha Mountain House Project: The East and West Courtyards are estimated to cost 5,533 yuan. (5) Building summer villas and a sanatorium: A gate tower is built in the middle of the East Pan Road, with two sections of steps to reach the mountain ridge. A four-sided pavilion is built on the ridge.</p>

<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>A flower bed is built to the south, and a platform is built to the north of the pavilion. Two sections of steps are built from the front of the pavilion to the east to reach the second ridge. Two sections of steps are built to the north to build a cross-shaped flowerbed, followed by two sections of steps to build a U-shaped two-story building. Three three-story buildings are built from the second ridge to the east mountain flank. A tennis court and a bathroom are also built, totaling 87,000 yuan. (6) Park construction project: A park is built from Nanweimen to the foot of the mountain, totaling 300,000 yuan. (7th)</p>
<h3>Qingdao National Arts Competition</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Qingdao National Arts Hall is holding a National Arts Recreational Competition today at the New Stage to promote martial arts and promote the national spirit. All the contestants are martial arts masters from the city, totaling 53 people. They are divided into three groups: A, B, and C. Group A includes those weighing over 170 pounds, Group B includes those weighing over 140 pounds, and Group C includes those weighing less than 140 pounds. Five people are selected from each of the three groups of A, B, and C, and then mixed for a competition to select the first place. Today, no less than 4,000 men and women visited, and the grand occasion has never been seen in Qingdao. The meeting was chaired by President Hu Jiafeng at 9:00 a.m. and began as usual. Then, the roll call competition began. All the contestants were brave and fought ahead, especially Ji Lunshi, a student from the municipal department school (only sixteen years old), who competed with the national artists as a child, winning a lot of applause. Several people were injured in the head during the competition, and there was a rescue team to apply medicine and treat them on the spot. The order of the competition was still good, but when the contestants Ji Yuren and Zhu Zhengsen competed, they fought so fiercely that it was almost impossible to break them up. Fortunately, the inspectors tried their best to stop them, and they were able to end the matter without incident. After the preliminary competition, the mixed finals were held, and Han Guanying and Ji Yuren competed for the championship. In the end, Han Guanying won the first place, Ji Yuren the second place, Sun Yuxiu the third place, Zhu Zhengsen the fourth place, Li Haiting the fifth place, and Sun Binggang the sixth place.

<h3>The Tragedy of the Lung-Hai Railway Derailment</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: The eighth passenger train on the Lung-Hai Railway, traveling east from Lingbao on May 31st, derailed at Shilibu, between Guanyintang and Mianchi, resulting in many deaths and injuries. A passenger who came from Luoyang to Bian reported in detail, saying that Guanyintang is only forty li away from Mianchi. On that day, the eighth passenger train departed from Guanyintang at 11:00 AM and reached Shilibu, about fifteen li away from Mianchi. The terrain there is a downhill slope, and trains must apply the brakes to slow down when passing through this section. In addition to more than ten ordinary carriages, this passenger train also had two carriages for civilians (provided free for disaster victims) and two military carriages. When the train passed over a small bridge, the train head suddenly burst due to excessive weight. As a result, seven carriages including the civilian carriages, military carriages, and other carriages immediately following the train head overturned into a small river beside the tracks (there were small rivers on both sides of the tracks, but there was no water). In addition, hundreds of hemp sacks containing a large quantity of small copper coins purchased from the western region by the Kaifeng Machinery Manufacturing Bureau were scattered on the ground and were looted by many poor people. An eyewitness said that he saw a child with his head crushed and bleeding still carrying away a large sack of coins. It can truly be said that they were willing to risk their lives for money. After the accident, Luoyang was the first to hear the news. Magistrate Chu immediately led dozens of members of the local militia to the scene to rescue and protect the passengers and their luggage. According to the investigation, forty-eight people died on the spot, and more than fifty people were slightly or seriously injured. Of the two hundred or so disaster victims traveling in the civilian carriages, only about one hundred survived, but they were greatly frightened. The station has been ordered to provide coffins for those who died and to bury them. For days, people from various places, young and old, have been flocking to the area to identify the bodies, and the sound of crying shook the fields. The fifty or so people who were slightly or seriously injured have all been transported to Luoyang Hospital. Most of these disaster victims were residents from the Shanxi-Lingbao area who were going to Luoyang to glean wheat, or residents from the Luo-Mian area who were returning from Lingbao after eating gruel. They did not achieve their goals and sacrificed their lives, dying not from the disaster but under the wheels. It is indeed tragic. Furthermore, according to local people, the disaster victims regarded the civilian carriages as their lifeboats. However, there were also some well-off people who pretended to be disaster victims to ride the train without paying, or to travel back and forth between the east and west to sell goods for profit. Therefore, the civilian carriages attached to each passenger train were always extremely crowded. As for the cause of the accident, there are two main points: (1) The engine parts were old and worn out. (2) The railway had been in disrepair for many years. Directly and indirectly, the domestic war can be blamed. The poor creatures who repeatedly suffer misfortunes can truly be said to have suffered injustices even in their death. (4th)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Express</h3>
<p>The third county administrative meeting held its fifth session today. It was resolved to unify local finances, with the Finance Bureau taking charge of all revenue and expenditure. As for education funding, it was also decided that 3% of the income from the county's land tax surcharges, property and land rent levies, and deed taxes would be allocated for educational academic property surcharges, in addition to the 5% allocated for local financial administration expenses. The academic property clearing committee was also officially established today, with Zhou Wen, Zheng Shangyuan, and Bao Guangqing elected as standing committee members.</p>
<p>The Wuhu branch of the Bank of China suddenly experienced a run this morning, but it was brief and quickly returned to normal. There were two reasons for this: first, Mr. Rong from Wuhu had entered the market and needed cash, but at that time, cash was scarce. Second, recently, counterfeit notes of the Bank of China have been found in the rural areas of Wuhu from time to time, leading to suspicion among a small number of people.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM today, stevedores from Shandong Province and local stevedores had a brawl at the Lizhi steamboat wharf over the right to handle cargo. After an hour of fierce fighting between the two sides, the military police arrived and dispersed them. More than a dozen people were injured, several of whom were seriously injured. They were taken to the court by the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>During the time when Wuhu's educational institutions had not been streamlined, those who received rice surcharges included the Industrial Vocational School, Wuhu Middle School, the Vocational Business School, the Public Service School, and the Education Bureau. After the streamlining, this funding was completely cut off. After consultation, the schools plan to request the authorities to allocate 50,000 yuan from the million-dan rice public bond to maintain operations.</p>
<p>Preparations for the Jing-Wu long-distance bus route have been underway for years. It is now found that the unfinished part of the project is the section from Caishi to Cihu in Anhui Province. Although the earthwork for the section in Jiangsu Province has been completed, culverts and bridges are still lacking. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau sent a letter to the Anhui Construction Department, agreeing to expedite construction simultaneously, and it is determined that the route will be open to traffic within the year.

<p>Minutes of the First Day of the County Administrative Meeting: Third County Administrative Meeting</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 AM today (the 10th). Thirty-seven members, including ex officio and appointed members, attended. County Magistrate Jin, as chairman, performed the opening ceremony according to protocol and delivered the opening address. Lu Changlin, standing committee member of the county party committee, Sun Shengzeng, director of the Construction Bureau, Shen Bingchen, director of the Finance Bureau, and Shen Jing, director of the Public Security Bureau, all gave speeches. A photo session was then held, and the meeting adjourned. After lunch, the meeting reconvened at 1:00 PM to distribute the agenda. Twenty proposals were discussed, mainly concerning how to adequately fund administrative expenses for township offices, increase salaries, purchase firearms, expand police forces, and consider expanding the police force by levying a household tax similar to that in Jinshan. All proposals were assigned to relevant departments for review. A resolution was passed to organize an inspection team to study district administration and send district chiefs to other counties to observe and learn from their experiences. The agenda was lengthy; the rest is omitted.</p>
<p>Organizing a Food Management Committee: The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to plan for the allocation of food throughout the province, has formulated regulations based on local warehouse management rules, ordering immediate compliance and rapid organization of county and district food management committees. County Magistrate Jin is now starting to reorganize the existing warehouse management committee and has appointed Zhang Kaiqi, Cai Guangyao, Wu Qianmei, Yu Yunding, Zhang [blank], Yao Linjiang, Shen Bingchen, and Li Zuhua as members, and has scheduled a meeting at the county government at 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month.</p>

<p>Detective Team Successively Cracks Burglary Cases: At the beginning of this month, a detective team arrested a burglar named Fan Amu. According to his confession, his accomplice, A Nan, from Zhangpu, committed burglaries in the county in March, stealing clothing and other items from the Hong family in Dongding. Recently, they also stole silver dollars from Chen Wanxing, who lives along the South City Riverbank. Amu acted as the lookout. The team leader led the detectives to Caojiadu, where the suspect was said to be hiding, but he was not there and had already returned to Zhangpu. They pursued and arrested him in Zhangpu, finding a pair of leather gloves used for tall hats and eighteen or so pearls. No other items were found. The team has handed him over to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Kidnapping Occurs in Zhujiacun: More than ten bandits broke into the home of Xu Shunfu in Zhujiacun, a village under the jurisdiction of the county, at about 11:30 PM the other night. After searching and looting, they kidnapped Xu's son, Fengming.</p>
<p>Tofu Shop Owner Commits Suicide: Sheng Guiqing, the thirty-two-year-old owner of a tofu shop south of the West City Bridge in Fangjiayao Township, the twelfth district of the county, was honest and hardworking. Recently, he fell ill and was bedridden. For reasons unknown, he suddenly committed suicide the other day, stabbing his throat with a chimney poker. Blood immediately flowed all over the bed. By the time his family noticed, it was too late to save him.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Investigating the Truth About the Conflict Between Songjiang and Fengxian Police: The county government has previously sent a letter of inquiry regarding the conflict between the eighth branch of the Public Security Bureau and the first team of the Songjiang police over the gambling case in Hujiaqiao. It is now learned that the county has sent a written reply, stating that the bureau's patrolmen were conducting an undercover operation to catch gamblers in Xixinyuan, leading to a misunderstanding with the local people. The team was notified and dispatched to suppress the situation, which resolved the situation. Not only is there a written statement from Mayor Pan to prove this, but Wu Shengzhi, the executive member of the town's Chamber of Commerce, and Yang Jihuan, the principal of the primary school, have also provided responsible testimony. The team was not involved in condoning gambling or assaulting the police. Now, the director of the branch, Zhu Huaiyi, mistakenly believes that there was interference, which is damaging to the team's reputation.</p>
<p>Since the two sides have differing accounts of what happened, the county government specially dispatched Chen Jinfang, the chief inspector of public security, yesterday to investigate the truth about the incident to verify what happened.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Appeal Hearing in the Wuxi Ferry Accident: On February 14th of this year, the Hengyi ferry operated by the Taili Company, which traveled between Wuxi and Daqiangmen, was sailing from Daqiangmen to Wuxi. Due to heavy snow, the ferry's roof had accumulated a thick layer of snow. As it approached Qingming Bridge wharf outside the South Gate of Wuxi, passengers crowded to the sides of the boat causing it to list precariously. Old Lu XingSheng, the helmsman, knew it was about to capsize and pulled back on the rudder to warn the driver to stop. However, the driver, Meng Yacai, panicked and jumped ashore, causing the ferry to sink. Twenty-three people fell into the water, thirteen of whom were rescued, while ten drowned. The local police detained Old Lu Xingsheng and the accountant Xiang Sanbao, transferring them to the Wuxi County Court for investigation. Last month, the court sentenced Yang Xiangqi, the company's manager, to a fine of 500 yuan, Xiang Sanbao to four months imprisonment, and acquitted Lu Xingsheng. The prosecutor appealed the acquittal of Lu XingSheng to the High Court. Yesterday (the 10th) afternoon, Court President Zhao of the First Criminal Division opened the hearing. As Sun Zuhong, the lawyer hired by Lu Xingsheng, had not arrived, the hearing was adjourned to an investigative session and rescheduled.</p>
<p>Suzhou Construction Bureau Plans for Waterworks: Due to the siltation of Suzhou's canals, the Construction Bureau and the County Government are planning to install waterworks. Yesterday (the 10th), a German engineer, Mr. Gunnell, a machinery and mining engineer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, came to Suzhou to negotiate with the County Government. At the same time, County Magistrate Huang also plans to open the Xu Gate and the Water Gate to clear the water flow in the urban area. In addition, Zheng Shouzhi, a Suzhou native and executive director of the Shanghai Jiangnan Paper Mill, has invested 15,000 yuan next to his residence in Gushi Lane to build a large artesian well, which can produce 7,500 dan of water per day for nearby residents to purchase. He will also install a free faucet in Zhuangjiaqiao Lane for use in case of fire. Construction is expected to begin in a week.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Impersonating a Military Officer: An Investigation at the Military Camp: Zhu Peiyu, who claimed to be a platoon leader of the Second Division of the National Army, and a woman named Fu Jinlian (erroneously called Fu Meimei yesterday) were staying at the Xin Hotel in the city. They were discovered by Shen Yiming, the battalion commander of the stationed troops, who suspected Zhu of impersonating a military officer and releasing pigeons with the woman. He devised a plan to detain Zhu and Fu. At 10:00 AM on the 9th, they were transferred from the Public Security Bureau to the military camp. The clerk interrogated Zhu Peiyu, who claimed to be a platoon leader in the Third Company, Seventh Regiment, Fourth Brigade of the Second Division, stationed at [unclear]. He stated that he had taken leave due to illness and was traveling to Suzhou to treat his hemoptysis. He claimed to reside in Suzhou and was not impersonating a military officer. He said that the letter of introduction and another symbol were sent to him by a friend. Fu Jinlian, he claimed, was his wife, whom he married in Shanghai two years ago and had a daughter with. He said that he didn't know why the hotel was registered under the name of Lin Jisheng as his wife registered the hotel before him. When questioned, Fu Jinlian initially claimed to be Zhu's legal wife, but after detailed interrogation, she admitted that they were not married and that she was a prostitute. She claimed that she was introduced to Zhu by matchmakers and that Zhu was an officer at the time but she did not know if he was still one. Zhu was very wealthy in Shanghai and ran a soy sauce shop. She said that the reason for coming to Changshu was that the pharmacy next door to the hotel sold medicine for leucorrhea. After the interrogation, due to time constraints, there was not much additional questioning. It was decided that Battalion Commander Shen would personally interrogate them today (the 10th). They are currently being held at the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Party Committee Member Accused, Court Appointed: Shen Zuguang, a member of the local county party committee, requested a re-examination by the county government of a body in a case that was handled outside the West Gate of the city after relatives of the deceased cried over the initial autopsy which was said to be unfair. As a result there were three dissections and autopsies. The adjudicator from the county government, Gu Yushang, resigned from his position at the High Court and accused Shen Zuguang of interfering with justice. The High Court was handling Shen Zuguang’s case, and it appointed the Shanghai District Court to handle the case. Due to Gu’s previous position at the Shanghai District Court, it was deemed necessary to avoid a conflict of interest. As such, the Wuxian District Court was once again appointed. It is said that the court will soon be summoned.</p>
<h3>Wujiang</h3>
<p>County Farmers' Association Officers' Meeting: The Wujiang County Farmers' Association held its fifth officers' meeting yesterday, chaired by Mao Xiaosen. The important proposals are excerpted below: (1) It was resolved that the Shenhu double-engine steamboats passing through various villages in the county were traveling at excessive speed, causing waves that repeatedly caused damage. With the current rise in floodwaters, there is concern that seedlings will be washed away. It was decided to telegraph the Provincial Government, Construction Department, Agriculture and Mining Department, and Civil Affairs Department to find a way to stop this and ensure the people's livelihood. (2) It was resolved that due to excessive rainfall this year, water pumps should be purchased in advance to prevent flooding.</p>
<p>Lake Bandits Rob and Kill One: It was learned that a lake bandit killed a man from Jiangbei, about thirty years old, in Nanku Town, which is under the jurisdiction of the county, on the 8th. After receiving the report, the county government immediately sent a water patrol team to the area. The body had already been taken away by the bandits. According to townspeople, the murdered man was also a scout for the bandits.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Liyang County Magistrate Arrests Chamber of Commerce Members: It was reported that Shi Junsheng, Di Dechen, Hu Guoguang, and Sun Zuze, members of the Liyang County Chamber of Commerce, were illegally arrested on May 30th by Li Jinfang, the magistrate of Liyang County, who forced them to confess. The Zhenjiang County Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs requesting that the county magistrate be removed from office and investigated. It is now learned that another telegram has been sent to the capital's Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, and the chambers of commerce of other counties, calling for collective support to safeguard the rights of merchants. The original telegram is recorded below: To the Liyang County Chamber of Commerce: We have read the telegram. It is deeply regrettable that your chamber's members have been illegally arrested by the county government. This is unprecedented in the history of chambers of commerce in Jiangsu Province. You have endured this and sought temporary peace by still providing the funds for firearms, amounting to a huge sum of 35,000 yuan. Those who knew about this at the time could not help but sigh at your chamber's magnanimity and the ruthlessness of the officials in your county. If they can oppress you to provide funds in the past, why can't they oppress you to change your confession today? As the saying goes, "When you tread on frost, you know that ice is coming." The situation has gradually worsened and did not happen overnight. County Magistrate Li Jinfang stated in his report to the province that the chamber was able to borrow the money without losing capital and was happy to return the interest. It seems that the officials view borrowing money as a good thing, and your chamber has almost accepted this as normal. Only your county magistrate could make such a strange statement, and only your chamber could receive such honor. We wonder if the chambers of commerce in other counties of Jiangsu Province will be wary of borrowing money from officials in the future, and what kind of position will the provincial authorities take if they approve of this statement?</p>
<p>The reason why people's organizations in society can represent the masses and lead them is that they are not intimidated by power and are not tempted by profit. When your chamber wired the Civil Affairs Department, it stated that the court was convened late at night, that members were forced to make confessions, and that they were forced to sign the confession. It is said that forcing a confession is not permitted by law and may not be effective, and that the members were easily intimidated. In the self-incriminating confession, in order to avoid being tempted by profit, the Shanghai newspaper reported on the 8th that County Magistrate Li Jinfang accused the members of colluding on the repayment of the loan and interest. Since the officials say that this was done together, there may be other reasons why they might not have done this voluntarily. If you continue to turn a blind eye and do not think about solving the problem thoroughly, not only will it be difficult for your chamber to resolve the situation, but it will also bring shame to the entire business community. Our chamber believes that County Magistrate Li Jinfang's illegal arrest of your chamber's members, forced confession late at night, restriction of communication, telegrams, and freedom is a violation of Article 8 and Article 13 of the provisional constitution, which came into effect after the National Government's declaration on June 1st. We have urgently sent a telegram to the provincial authorities, requesting that they severely punish the magistrate in accordance with the declaration of the National Government. It should not be overlooked. The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce respectfully requests your attention. A separate telegram was sent to the head of the capital city Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, and other county Chambers of Commerce that the Liyang Chamber of Commerce was recently reported being arrested. This case concerns illegal arrests and violations of the provisional constitution. General support is needed to safeguard these guarantees. I trust that you will all strive toward that goal. Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce respectfully requests your attention.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang's 20th Annual Budget Finalized: Zhenjiang County's 20th annual local budget was finalized yesterday at a meeting. Regular income is estimated at 362,453, and there is a temporary income shortfall. Regular expenditure is estimated at 335,139, and temporary expenditure is estimated at 27,124. Methods for Business Tax Discussed at Industry Meetings: Because Jiangsu Province has ordered the urgent collection of business tax, the various industry associations in Zhenjiang County held a joint meeting to discuss implementation methods. The resulting resolutions were as follows: (1) Each industry's business tax will be handled by the industry's association in principle. However, associations that do not wish to handle it are not obligated to. However, associations that agree to handle it must first report their industry's annual turnover and their estimated tax revenue to the business tax bureau. If the Chamber of Commerce needs to coordinate, it can do so. The agreed-upon tax will be paid directly to the tax bureau by each association on a quarterly basis. (2) The Chamber of Commerce will verify all submitted survey forms to ensure accuracy. For the verification process, three groups will be responsible. Each group will be responsible for verifying eleven industries. The chair of each industry association (or a designated representative) will be asked to attend a meeting to thoroughly verify the forms. This should be completed by the 10th of this month. (3) Stores in each industry that have not joined the association will be included in the Chamber of Commerce's report in principle. If it is truly difficult to include them, the business tax bureau will handle them directly. (4) Shops</p>
<p>stores (referring to those that have not joined the Chamber of Commerce) will be collected by the business tax bureau</p>
<p>Provincial Government Emphasizes Production in Jiangbei: The Jiangsu Provincial Government has recently approved a document from the General Pacification Bureau stating that, according to inspector Chen Gan's report, the reason Jiangbei is a bandit-producing area is due to the difficulty people have in obtaining food and clothing. In the future, emphasis should be placed on increasing people's production. The Provincial Government approved the document and stated that focusing on people's livelihood is fundamental to suppressing banditry. Governments at all levels and the people must work together to quickly plan and strive for solutions. Therefore, it specially instructed the agriculture and farmers' departments to transfer these concerns to the county magistrates of Jiangbei to pay close attention to production efforts to address the root cause and effectively implement pacification.</p>
<p>Each money house promoted its business. Zhenjiang Xiwujie Baoheng Money House recognized that although Luhe County is in the interior, its business scene is no less bustling than Zhenjiang. It launched a co-funded money house to be established there. The organization is now in order, named Baoyu, with a capital of 136,000. Fang Shaoqing and others have been publicly recommended to manage the business. It was reported that they entered into a contract at the Dahua Hotel the other day.</p>
<p>Poor silk production in the four townships. Every spring in Zhenjiang, silk production would bring people shoulder to shoulder. Due to weather circumstances this year, silk production has fallen and many silk businesses have had very few customers. Within the past week, the businesses that had the most success recorded just over 300 loads; the ones that had the least recorded just over 100 loads. The silk is also less than excellent. Yesterday, the price of silk rose to 64 yuan.</p>

Chairman Wang Jingting led the meeting, and after discussions, it was unanimously agreed that since other counties have not borrowed money for this tax, the county should follow suit and deny borrowing. After the meeting, the resolution was sent to the tax bureau for review.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Letter from Wulilqiao Coal Factory, Changxing Coal Mine</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor of the Shanghai Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Having read your newspaper's second page on June 8th, which reported on a "Miners Gambling, Beating Police, and Resisting Arrest" incident, the facts are largely inconsistent with the truth. Upon investigation, at 2:00 PM on June 4th, the Changxing County Public Security Bureau went to Yin Jiajiao, Wulilqiao, to arrest gamblers and clashed with them, even opening fire, resulting in casualties among the police. The incident did not occur within the scope of our factory, and it occurred during the workers' working hours; Zhu did not participate in the gambling, and the report that it was "miners resisting" is inaccurate. The claim that the "coal mine defense corps mistakenly identified them as bandits and opened fire" is even more fabricated. We are sending this letter to request a correction to clarify the facts.</p>
<p>With respectful wishes,</p>
<p>Changxing Coal Mine, Wulilqiao Coal Factory, Construction Committee,</p>

<p>Educational News Discussions</p>
<h3>Should Animal Fable Readings Be Abolished? (1) Chen Heqin</h3>
<p>Whether or not to abolish animal fable readings depends on how the following two questions are resolved:</p>
<p>(1) Do children like to listen to, watch, and tell these kinds of readings?</p>
<p>(2) What impact do these kinds of readings have on children after they listen to, watch, and tell them?</p>
<p>If children do not like these kinds of readings, we certainly should not give them to them. If they do like them, then we must see if these kinds of readings have a bad impact on them. If children like these kinds of readings, but the impact is very bad, then these kinds of readings are certainly not suitable. We know that there are many things that children like, but that may not be good for them, so to determine whether animal fable readings have value, we only need to look at the above two points.</p>
<p>From my personal experience, young children, especially those under the age of seven, like to listen to and watch animal fable readings the most. As for the harm, I really can't see any. However, let me briefly talk about whether these kinds of readings are needed by children.</p>
<p>When children are over one year old, they develop many actions and many interests in various things. We adults may find it very strange, but from the perspective of children, it is a very ordinary thing. If you don't believe me, please look at the following facts:</p>
<p>(1) Horse Riding. When my child, Yi Ming, was one year old, he would use anything that could be ridden, such as table legs, chair backs, sticks, etc., as a horse to ride. Not only that, but sometimes, when he heard others say the word "horse" or the words "horse riding," he would immediately jump up and down like he was riding a horse, and shout "a, a, a."</p>
<p>This situation of "using a stick as a horse" is a very common and widespread thing in children's lives in various countries. Should we adults not allow children to enjoy this very common and widespread childhood? Should we adults not let children see, hear, and tell stories about this kind of life?</p>
<p>But we must also think carefully, isn't this "using a stick as a horse" even more bizarre and unreasonable than animal fables?</p>
<p>(2) Dolls. A child who is a little over one year old and still unable to speak can hug a doll, pat it with his hand, and make a sound of "a, a" to indicate that he is talking to it. When he gets a little older, three years old, he can talk to the doll as if he is doing a ventriloquist act.</p>
<p>Does he really believe that the doll is a real child? If he did believe that the doll was a real child, then he would have some kind of mental illness. I ask, which country's children, whether wild or civilized, ancient or modern, do not play with these kinds of dolls? And to treat the doll as a real child is probably extremely rare.</p>
<p>(3) Humorous Pictures. Which of the following two pictures do children not like to see? Which children do not like to read books about these kinds of pictures? But do they believe that pigs really dance? Are fruits really like people? Absolutely not. Then why don't we adults allow them to enjoy these fun things?</p>
<p>(4) Humorous Movies. (A) Yesterday, I went to see a movie, and the first film was "Felix" (Black Cat). At that time, all the children in the audience applauded loudly and were very happy when they saw "Felix" (Black Cat) appear. This humorous story is often published in mainland Chinese newspapers. This black cat can not only talk, but also do things that are often unreasonable and against nature, and that human beings cannot do.</p>
<p>But do children believe that black cats really have such abilities? They absolutely do not believe it. But when they watch it, they show great joy. After watching it, they do not go home and treat their own cats in the house as "Felix."</p>

<h3>New Swimming Pool at Dongya Physical Education School</h3>
<p>Construction Has Been Underway for a Long Time and Will Be Completed Within a Week</p>
<p>Construction Costs Total 14,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Dongya Physical Education School has gone through thirteen years. It was initially established on Fangxie Road, Ximen. As the number of students increased year by year, the original site was insufficient, so in the year before last, a site was purchased in Caotang Street, Lujiawan, to build a new school building. The men's department was moved in, while the women's department remained at the original location. As a result, the scale and equipment were improved, and experts were recruited to teach, while funds were raised. Principal Chen Mengyu and Academic Director Chu Bomin worked hard. In terms of teaching, they were more realistic and did not engage in formalism. Academically, Jiang Xiangqing, Sun Hebin, and others gave lectures. The emergence of talented people is the reason why there are 400 students in both the men's and women's departments. Since April of this year, a large swimming pool has been built next to the new school building. The pool is 25 meters long and 8 meters wide, with a capacity of 100,000 gallons. Bathrooms, changing rooms, and rest rooms are built next to the pool. The design is well-thought-out, and the construction project is huge, with a total construction cost of 14,000 yuan. It will be completed in its entirety in one week. From now on, there will be another place for aquatic sports in Shanghai. It is reported that the school authorities plan to open the pool to benefit the public during the summer vacation.</p>

<h3>A Grand Procession for the Du Shrine</h3>
<p>—Lu Jingqing</p>
<p>The grand procession for the Du shrine, which caused a sensation in Shanghai, set off from the Du family's residence on Huage Nie Road on the morning of the 9th of this month and crossed the Huangpu River to the Du shrine in Gaoqiao. The grandeur and splendor were unprecedented. From early morning, at the Eight Immortals Bridge, people crowded together, shoulder to shoulder, and everything along the procession route, such as vegetable markets, teahouses, inns, and restaurants, was occupied by spectators as temporary viewing platforms. It was truly a magnificent sight.</p>
<p>The first row of the procession consisted of dozens of huge, unlit national flags and large Du-character colored flags, each held by dozens of people and waving in the wind like rising clouds. A British constable on horseback led the way, followed by a large team of Chinese constables, French constables, Vietnamese constables, and the French Municipal Council Military Band. In the middle were mixed the military bands of the Garrison Command and the Municipal Bureau, various organizations, various armies, and various charitable groups. The Navy Military Band at the end was even more spectacular. When the music was played, it was bold and stirring, resounding through the clouds. There were also dozens of incomparably tall ten-thousand-people umbrellas, beautifully eye-catching, each held by seven or eight people, all presented by various domestic and overseas merchants, public associations, and groups. There were also dozens of flower baskets of various colors, fragrant and refreshing. The largest of them was far larger than the lanterns in the lantern festival, with a variety of colors and ingenious craftsmanship. There were also several extra-large gongs, carried by many people, with a sound exceeding that of a great bell. There were also hundreds of complete sets of palace regalia, with spears and swords shining in the sun, dignified and solemn, like ancient guards of the British Palace. There were also countless colored plaques presented by various circles. There were also dozens of tall bamboos with fluttering and elegant leaves, tied with silk banners of couplets, mostly elegant literary works, many of which were written by famous artists. The flag bearers were in orderly rows, swaying gracefully. The various armies, defense corps, police teams, and boy scouts accompanying the procession were full of vigor. The huge plaques, resplendent with gold and jade, were mostly inscribed by party and national heroes and great figures from various provinces, which attracted the attention of passers-by. For example, Chiang Kai-shek inscribed "Filial Piety Is Never Exhausted," Yu Youren inscribed "A Long and Distinguished Lineage," Zhang Xueliang inscribed "Courage to Do What Is Right," Wu Peifu inscribed "A Military Family," Duan Qirui inscribed "Hoping for Jin Chang," and the Panchen Lama inscribed "Careful to the End and Reminiscent of the Distant Past." In addition, there were also plaque pavilions from various deans, ministers, provincial chairmen, and division commanders. Also, Consul-General Gangerlin, Police Commissioner Favori, and Municipal Council Superintendent Wei Zhiren all presented large Chinese-character plaques, all written by Mr. Zhang Xiaolin. It is said that Mr. Zhang is very accomplished in calligraphy, and it is not easy to imitate the self-improvement of Lao Quan. Finally, there was Chairman Chiang's inscription plaque pavilion, like clouds and rainbows, splendid and noble. The ancestral tablet sedan chair was also colorful and magnificent. Those who accompanied the procession were the Du family members, the sons, and the famous beauties of Shanghai, with their fragrant clothes, hair ornaments, precious jewelry, and sparkling cars, creating a bustling scene. In addition, there were no fewer than three thousand people accompanying the procession. O, what a grand sight!</p>
<h3>On Titles</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>Ancient and modern times differ, and northern and southern customs vary. People's titles are often different. These differences are not strange. What is most strange is that the same title can have vastly different meanings. For example, isn't "Doctor" the most fashionable title today? The "Book of Han" says that the title "Doctor" was an official title in the Qin Dynasty. Examining Gong Yi Xiu, who served as a Doctor in Lu, even before the Qin Dynasty, proves its ancient elegance. However, since the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, there have been "Tea Doctors" who, as seen in "Water Margin," brew tea and serve customers, similar to today's waiters. There are also "Grinding Doctors," as seen in "Journey to the West," referring to monks and Daoists. If they weren't "Grinding Doctors," how would they know how to use rolling pins? This refers to today's pastry chefs. There are also "Dyeing Doctors," referring to today's dyers. It is unclear why they have such an elegant title. As for "Waiting-for-Edict," in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, it referred to officials in the Hanlin Academy, originally from the Han Dynasty's "Waiting-for-Edict at the Golden Horse Gate." How distinguished and noble! Famous calligraphers and painters like Wen Zhengming used this official title. How elegant! However, in old Beijing, it was used to refer to barbers. Often, in government offices, the head servant would loudly call out, "Waiting-for-Edict!" and the barber would bring his kit and enter. Seeing this, I couldn't help but laugh. According to "Water Margin," there were "Head-Shaving Waiting-for-Edict" as early as then. Titles such as "Grand Master" and "Attendant" are purely official titles. However, doctors are referred to as such. Northerners often say "See the Grand Master" when sick, while Southerners say "See the Attendant." The titles vary between the North and South. If they were interchanged, people would be confused. Even simply changing the order of the words to "See the Grand Master" or "Look at the Attendant" would cause even more confusion. As for "Hall Official," in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, Hall Officials of the Six Ministries and Grand Secretaries were highly regarded. However, in the early Qing Dynasty, the servants used by governors-general and governors were also called "Hall Officials," as seen in the Yongzheng Emperor's rescripts. This title was still narrow. Now, waiters in restaurants and bathhouses are all called "Hall Official," making it the most common title. As for "Sir" and "Master," judging from the names, they are extremely solemn. However, there is a saying: "Prime Minister is Sir, Scholar is Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir." The reply is, "Husband is Master, Teacher is Master, Master, Master, Master." Both the noble and the lowly share this title. The caller doesn't choose, and the recipient isn't offended. This is also strange. The so-called "Sir, Sir" was banned at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Young people in the Republic didn't experience its prevalence. There is a book called "Biographies of Flowers." Try purchasing it to get a general idea. Such customs and figures also existed in medieval Rome, but I don't know what grand name they were broken with. As for "Sir," it is used to respect fathers, elder brothers, and teachers, and can sometimes be used generally, but it is never applied to women. However, in Shanghai, prostitutes are called "Sir." Based on the distinction between pure and impure, they are called "Big Sir" and "Little Sir." Based on impurity pretending to be pure, they are called "Sharp Sir." Since the term "Sir" existed, there has never been such fragrant usage. Also, "First Master," "Second Master," and "Third Master" are respectful terms for the order of brothers. In the North, from the royal family to ordinary people, it was the same. The servants used in government offices in various provinces also received this title. However, "Third Master" was considered lower, referring to the servant of a servant. The "Three Little Ones" mentioned by Granny Lai, who "set foot in the government office but never saw an official," is a good example. If someone entered a government office and addressed someone who wasn't a servant as "First Master" or "Second Master," or mistakenly called a "First Master" or "Second Master" a "Third Master," they would definitely be scolded. As for "Hall Guest," in the North, it is used as a respectful term for women, similar to calling male guests "Official Guests." However, in the southern provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi, although it is used to refer to women, it carries a meaning of inferiority and contempt. There is an amusing anecdote I witnessed. During the Guangxu reign, a certain elderly master from the South ordered a female servant to take his children to the Qianmen Theater to watch a play. The usher refused, saying, "We don't sell to Hall Guests." This meant "We don't sell to female seats." The Northerners didn't find it offensive, but the female servant was furious and ordered the attendant and coachman to take the usher to the authorities. The neighboring shop intervened and mediated, ordering the usher to apologize before the matter was dropped. The most wonderful thing was that not only the usher and others, but also the attendants and coachmen, didn't understand why the term "Hall Guest" had offended the female servant so much. As for shop owners, Southerners call them "Boss" (pronounced "ban," the meaning of the word is yet to be examined), while in the North, it refers to the leader of prostitutes and actors. Addressing a Northern merchant as "Boss" is insulting. Only by calling them "Shopkeeper" will they be pleased. As a traveling official, I have traveled through more than ten provinces and passed through more than three hundred prefectures, states, and counties. The titles I have heard are numerous and strange, unimaginable, and some have sounds but no corresponding characters. What I have written down only accounts for one in a thousand. Yang Xiong held a chisel and began to compile a book on dialects. It is truly a useful work. Now, there are many famous publications in the Shanghai publishing world. If a "Titles" section were created and compiled into a book, its value would surely surpass Yang Xiong's book. Broad-minded and insightful people would not dismiss this idea as foolish.</p>
<h3>On Shad</h3>
<p>— Zhestun Cun</p>
<p>Shad is produced in the Yangtze River of Jiangsu Province. When willow flowers are in full bloom, shad swim in schools. The best ones are cooked and eaten on Jiao Mountain, because the silver scales and the fish just out of the net can be served in a moment, and the freshness and tenderness are extraordinary. It is difficult to find this good fortune elsewhere. Every time this season comes, Zhenjiang commercial ships go back and forth several times a day to carry tourists to Jiao Mountain. I have also participated in this prosperous event. When it first comes on the market, a fish is priced at ten or eight yuan, and the extravagant Yangzhou people compete to buy it without thinking it is expensive. When cooking shad, the scales are not removed, and there is oil inside the scales. When eating, use chopsticks to wipe it off. The fat in the abdomen is very thick, and there are not many bones, and the bones are more than an inch long and form a three-pronged shape, which is easy to pick out and does not hinder chewing. Peng Yuanzai's hatred of its many bones is not an accurate statement. I have also eaten Songjiang perch many times, and its richness and beauty are not inferior to shad. Reading Fan Chengda's "Farmhouse Miscellany," he says, "Finely chop oranges and cook them with fish. The west wind blows up four-gilled perch. The snow is crispy and greasy with thousands of strands. Except for Songjiang, there is no such flavor anywhere." The flavor can be imagined! I have also tasted Yellow River carp, but it is nothing more than fat and tender. According to the lakes, marshes, beaches, and streams belonging to the Huaiyang area, there are many whitebait, and the large ones weigh more than a few kilograms. The taste is no less than shad. It is a pity that the large ones do not always exist. I have been living in seclusion in my hometown in recent years, at this time of spring river water droplets.</p>

<h3>Travelogue of the Yellow Sea (27)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>We must not misunderstand that their recession is due to overproduction and blame it on science. The recession is not entirely due to overproduction. Even if we talk about overproduction, we can only say that they did not use science appropriately and cannot blame science itself. Moreover, their recession has figures that can be calculated. A country like China with underdeveloped science, can we still calculate the recession with figures? Can we count them? We must understand that the usual construction is entirely science. Once a war breaks out, besides the authority of science, what else can control everything? Future scientific wars will be ten thousand times more terrible than the past, I dare to assert. Therefore, promoting scientific research and science at this time is not just following the crowd and supporting the facade, it is simply our country and nation finding a way to survive from death.</p>
<p>The third is that everyone should unite. This is probably the most difficult paper to hand in. For twenty years, this weakness has been exposed the most severely. National consciousness has not developed greatly. The territory is large, and the time for transportation is still short. Customs and dialects are different. Only the strength of local ideas is expressed everywhere, and very little enthusiastic national thought is expressed. At least two necessary conditions are required for the unity of all groups, that is, there is a common object to the outside world and a common center of faith to the inside. Now that international oppression is getting tighter day by day, the common objects outside the group are becoming more and more obvious, but the center of faith is not easy to cultivate. Originally, faith comes entirely from nature and cannot be forced. With a doctrine, it is still necessary to look at the people who implement the doctrine, and since the advancement of thought, the expectations for the central figure are higher and the conditions are more demanding. In the past, it was just civil and martial arts, but now, to gain the faith of the masses, you may have to combine the personality of modern figures like Gandhi, so that people can recognize it more and more clearly day by day and have a firmer and firmer belief day by day. Relying solely on civil governance will not climb the stage, and relying solely on martial arts will not easily hold the final victory. It must be combined with the leadership of the third personality condition outside of civil and martial arts.</p>
<p>But I have to say that what I hope from the general public is that they already understand the true meaning of common life. If the result of disunity will lead to mutual destruction, then the most common mental illnesses, such as suspicion, jealousy, infighting, creating rumors, slander, eliminating dissidents, etc., are like the strange temper of old women in the Three Family Village, sweeping away everything, and replacing them with sincerity of love and affection. But love and affection are different from forbearance for the country. Forbearance cannot be for the country. If someone in a group does something that violates the law and hinders the public, it must not be tolerated because they are in the same group, otherwise, how can others, especially people outside the group, be convinced? Therefore, the eight characters of love, sincerity, purity, integrity, and righteousness must be realized at the same time. In short, the rule of man must be combined with the rule of law, and then the great unity can be stable.</p>

<h3>Three Eras (2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>As soon as the child saw the sour plum soup stall, he gesticulated to buy it. The wife pulled the child's hand and said, "Don't talk nonsense, sour plum soup is so dirty, the ice is all from the moat, there's shit and urine in there, you're sure to get diarrhea." Saying that, she pulled him inside with a bang and closed the door. The sour plum soup seller said, "Dirty? Emperor Xuantong ate the banquets of Dongxinglou. Isn't the ice in the lotus root and fresh walnut kernel dishes the same? It's just that it looks better in a foreign porcelain dish." Zhang Xiaosan said, "People will have these tastes when they have money. I drink a few bowls of sour plum soup every day and I'm still alive, I haven't had diarrhea. It would be good to die of diarrhea, so I don't have to suffer in the world." Saying and laughing, he drank another bowl, took two big copper coins from under the foot pad in the car and threw them on the tray, pulled the car and walked slowly. He calculated that today he would hand over the car to the car factory and get ten or eight more hangings outside of the share, enough for a day's food. So he sang happily, saying, "In the first month of the lunar year, I go to see the plum blossoms, I take my little sister to see the lanterns, sister, watching the lanterns is fake, seeing my sister is true love..."</p>
<p>"Singing such obscene songs in the broad daylight, do you want to be beaten?" He looked up and saw that it was a policeman on duty, speaking to him fiercely. Zhang Xiaosan lowered his head, pulled the car and walked slowly with his head lowered, but muttered in his mouth, "What does this have to do with you? Rickshaw pullers should all die, they can't even sing a few sentences when they're happy." The policeman also clearly heard him arguing in his mouth, as long as he didn't sing, he wouldn't pay attention to him. Zhang Xiaosan's car pulled further away. He saw a comrade coming from the opposite side, also pulling an empty car slowly, and muttered to himself, "Damn it, it's unlucky, the patrol police always have trouble with the rickshaw pullers." Rickshaw pullers have such a strange temper of loving to make friends and loving to become enemies. On the street, they pull each other's cars, as long as they are under the same car owner, they talk and talk while walking. Although they are panting and sweating, they answer every question. Conversely, if someone bumps into someone or gets in the way a little, they immediately use their superiors and even relatives as weapons for a fierce battle.</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Prices See Strange Surge Again</h3>
<p>News of a Bank Closing in the US</p>
<p>Soars Fifteen Taels and Nine Qian Yesterday, the benchmark gold price suddenly surged, following Meng Jin's steady progress and frequent steps higher. The unified market had been at thirteen or fourteen taels, but looking back, it suddenly surged to sixteen taels. From early morning, it had already broken through the 800-tael mark, likely due to the silver market reporting a drop. Subsequently, there were still many buyers, and the exchange rate trend was also strong, but the listed price did not change. Especially because the spot goods had already been shipped out, the intentions of the industry were very high. Therefore, the market sentiment was extremely sharp. The short sellers were in a hurry to cover their positions, and it had already risen to more than 0.08 taels. The board was very small. The market felt that the peak had exceeded 810 taels. Finally, it reached more than 815 taels, and the buyers were excited. Only the Wednesday exchange bills were usually inactive. It was feared that the Indian exchange rate would fall and would fall again.</p>
<p>Morning Market Already Intended to Advance In the morning, the opening of the July contract rose by 3 taels and 3 qian to 802 taels. Large strips fell by one-sixteenth, silver prices by one-eighth, and private telegrams fell by three-sixteenths. The European market was very soft, so people's hearts were agitated. Fuyu, Zhifeng, Yongcheng, Fengyong, Qianchangxiang and others all had acceptances and continued to rise by more than 2 taels, but there was 1 liang lurking. It was learned that there was news from foreign telegraphs that Citibank had a bank closing, so it had risen to 0.04 taels and 3 qian, and British gold was 121.875 to 25. Bank entries and exits were possible. The announcement was not changed, and the sale by Wanxing Shunli, etc., was reduced to 0.03 taels and 23 qian. It immediately rose to 0.05 taels, which was bought by Tong Taichang, Yu Dada, and Decheng. Later, the bank sold British gold for 1.875, and it was sold by Yuanmao, Yongtianfeng, Yongyongfeng, Yuanxingyong, etc. It immediately fell by 1 liang and 10 points to 0.03 taels. In a moment, the bank ate in the recent British gold 1.875, and Yuanxingyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yu Dafuyu, Yuantai, etc. chased after it, and it rose by 4 taels and 10 points to 0.07 taels. At this time, Qianchangxiang, Dachengyu, Dayuanxingyong sold it, and it was suppressed by more than 3 taels. It was about to reach 11 o'clock at 0.03 taels and 45 qian. After that, Zhifengyong, Yuanxingyong, Longshen, Hengxing, Yuancheng, Yongchangsheng, etc. rushed in. As for British gold, it was not easy to settle at 1.875, so it jumped up again by 5 taels at noon to 0.08 taels and 4 qian. At the close of the market at 0.07 taels and 7 qian, it was raised to more than 8 taels again. Zhifengyong, etc. were accepting. The listed price was still 838 taels and 2 qian, and the press was between 34 and 5 taels. At noon, it was only suppressed between 30 taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Actually Stepped onto the Sky In the afternoon market, the opening price was 0.09 taels, followed by 0.08 taels and 1 qian. Later, Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Chengfengyong, Yuancheng Yong, etc. came to compete to buy, and the market price jumped by 3 taels. At 2:20, it was 11 taels, and Bingxing sold quite a bit, so it泻 two taels. At 2:30, it was 0.09 taels, 12 qian. Afterwards, it increased by 2 taels because the Indian exchange rate was small. Because Yuanxingyong, Yuantai, Yuanmaoyong, etc. bought in, it was 11 taels and 3 qian at 2:30. Later, a certain retail户 sold it to short, so it fell by 1 liang and 0 at 10 taels. At 3:30, the buyers were excited. It was estimated that Fuyu, Yuancheng, Xincheng, Yiyu, Hengyu, Yu Da and Yuanxingyong etc. bought, so the price rose sharply. In the situation where the wind and clouds were surging, the Indian exchange rate and telegrams actually fell by three to seven annas. At about 4:10, it suddenly became 15 taels and 5 qian. Then it fell sharply by 2 taels to 13 taels and a half. At the close of the market at 4:30, it was 14 taels and 6 qian, a sharp increase of 15 taels and 9 qian compared with the previous day. Then it was made to 4 liang's view, and then because the buyers continued to replenish, it was blasted to 5 taels, 78 qian. According to the full day's maximum price of 15 taels and 5 qian, the minimum price of 0.02 taels, the difference is 13 taels and a half. The goods opened at 0.02 taels in the morning and closed at 0.07 taels and 3 qian in the afternoon, and 0.08 taels and 8 qian in the afternoon. The closing price was 14 taels and a half. It was estimated that the price was small at 30 taels to 23 or 4 taels. The account was opened at 0.08 taels in the morning and 15 taels in the afternoon. The water replenishment was 0.06 taels in the afternoon and 13 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The Momentum for Seeking Is Strong Each number of transactions seeks more supply and less. It is estimated that Yuanmaoyong, Chengfengyong, Cuichangyong, Zhifengyong, Bingxing, Xinheng, Hengxing, Yuanlongshen, Senchangyong, Yuantai Fuyu are all entering. Tongtaichang enters more and exits less. Wanxingshunli, Qianchangxiang, Hengyu all exit. Futaiheng, Yuanxingyong, Yuanhengyong, Fengtaixingyong have quite a lot of ins and outs. The goods条子 are generally sold out. In the afternoon, Fuyu Yuancheng, Yongchun, Yuanyong, Hengyu, Yuancheng, Xinheng, Yiyu, Yuantai, Chengfengyong are all entering. Yuanxingyong enters more than 1,000条, including 条子代客. Several hundred 条子 were sold out. Yuanmaoyong, Zhifengyong, Daxingyong, Futaiheng, Xieda, etc. are sold in and out from time to time. Bingxing sold 1,000 条. Qianchangxiang, Tianyuyongshunli, Wanxing sold more than they bought. The general retail short sellers had no choice but to replenish their positions. The goods套头 entry and exit were different. Guangdong Bang's transaction details were generally optimistic about speculative traders who had some purchases. Dalian Bang sold a total of more than 3,000 条 and entered a total of more than 2,000 条.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Turns Strong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets both reported a slight decline, and the market was quiet. The United States' desire to sell was on the rise, but HSBC's listing price in Shanghai remained unchanged. It was estimated that the internal market trend of banks was tight, and the benchmark gold price was at a peak, having broken out of the 810-tael mark. At noon, compared with the day before, the British gold had shrunk by 125 and the US dollar had shrunk by 25, and the Japanese gold had risen by one and a half points. However, in the afternoon, due to Wednesday, there was usually no market, and the gold industry was fiercely 결. British gold was transacted for more than 200,000 pounds. The banks' desire to sell was not bad. The US dollar was sold from Manila, and it was the Japanese banks that chased after it, while the Chinese merchants did not have much entry and exit. It was estimated that many banks in Japan were about to close down due to poor circulation. Therefore, the exchange market did not decline.</p>

<h3>Lidi Falls, Split Even</h3>
<p>Market Overview Yesterday morning, because people's hearts were falling, the market was weak, and the transaction was still not very vigorous. As for the banking sector, it was even more寂.

<h3>Securities: Bond Prices Spin Around and Tend to Be Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were only sporadic transactions in the spot market of public bonds, and the forward market was also slightly quiet, so the transaction was slightly inferior. The bond market was环象 quiet, and the big households watched. The supply and demand were balanced, and the price was stable. Each board had no major changes. Only the market was active, so the results were consistent and slightly increased, but the number was only about half a yuan. The quiet situation was only seen in recent days. It is estimated that the turnover of spot goods for the whole day was 29,000 yuan, and the pre-market of the forward market was very clear, only about 4,900,000, and the post-market was more旺, estimated to be opened for more than 8,500,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Turns to Stability</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned firm because the actual sales are more active. Sichuan and Guangdong gangs are purchasing strongly. Therefore, people's hearts are more挺, and the Japanese yarn根子 is very tight. However, the overseas cotton yarn situation is still trending down, so a part of it is still觀疲. However, the gold price has turned to涨風, and the market盤 has taken a step higher. However, both the multi-party and the empty-party in塲存 are watching, so the transaction is very 清澹. If the actual demand can continue to improve, the market may have an increase, but the silver price is difficult to be long, and the US cotton three-product yarn is difficult to increase.</p>
<p>The Bidding is Boosted by Actual Sales In the early market, although the US cotton fell, the market lacked sellers, and the market was not虛, near was small 2 qian, far涨 34 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the spot sales were good, and the market气紧涨. Each涨 3·4·6 qian. It is estimated that the total transaction for the whole day was 6,600 bales. It was found that Hesh慎 sold 450 bales, Taixing 300 bales, Dachangcheng 500 bales, and Chang</p>
<h3>Cotton Market in Cautious Firmness</h3>
<p>The cotton market remains firm due to the scarcity of underlying goods and the lack of arrivals from various regions. However, U.S. cotton is gradually trending downward, and new low prices have been discovered, so people are not acting rashly. Cash goods are scarce, and new sellers dare not take hasty action. The market has become stagnant, with very little business being done, and both buyers and sellers are taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>Hankow Standards Show No Significant Movement. Although U.S. cotton fell during the Hankow Standards pre-market trading, the lack of new sellers caused the market to firm up, with each standard rising by five points. In the afternoon, the situation remained quiet, and it rose another five points. The total transaction volume was 20,700 bales. The sales were: Jifeng 700 bales, Gongtai 900 bales, Xinheng 1,000 bales, Hengyi 600 bales. The purchases were: Changfeng 700 bales, Da 700 bales, Touda 900 bales. The closing prices of Hankow Standards are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>A total of 382 bales of Yao cotton were calculated.</p>
<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton Both Soften</h3>
<p>U.S. Cotton Bulls Close Positions. Yesterday, U.S. cotton first firmed up due to purchases by peers, but then weakened due to the Wall Street slump and bull closures. Futures fell 15 to 20 points, and spot prices fell 20 points. Yellow cotton futures rose 15 points, and spot prices rose 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. The Indian cotton market was quiet and firm, initially firming due to short covering, but then slightly retreating due to weak news from Liverpool.  Pingguole, Aumula, and Bailuoxi all rose 5 rupees. The telegram record is on the left (dated the 9th):</p>

<h3>Grains: Hexia Rice Market Continues Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday's rice market remained sluggish, with little sign of recovery. Supplies continued to flow in, especially from Changshu and other areas, making it difficult to improve sentiment. With abundant inventory, outlets for various shops have further decreased. Thick japonica early and late rice are each short by one chi. Du Yangjian is also softening. Only the brewing demand for rice wine during the approaching Dragon Boat Festival remains strong, and prices are stable. Yesterday, a trainload of Nanjing tip rice arrived from the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, but the goods were not displayed at the warehouses, making the market even more quiet. Due to the bad weather, the rice prices in Hexia are difficult to improve.</p>
<p>Hunan, Shanghai: Yesterday's rice situation saw few arrivals, and sales were sluggish. The situation for Changshu and Xibei japonica rice remained stable, as purchases from the countryside were not quiet. A slight amount of Sutong Xibei japonica rice arrived, but retail demand was weak, with only a few wholesale buyers making inquiries, resulting in high pricing and subsequent weakness. The sales of Nangang thin early rice and Ningbo japonica rice continued, but street sales were not smooth, and opening prices were lowered by one jiao. Du Yangjian rice was scarce, and prices did not rise or fall. Glutinous rice and white shade rice remained flat and sales were dull. Merchants seemed eager to sell quickly, so the market softened by half a chi, making the market quite weak.</p>
<h3>Starch Market Shows Flat and Weak Signs</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the starch market opened in the morning and afternoon, with the market for each month generally trending sideways and weak. Foreign wheat quotations continued to decline by two, three, or four jiao or so, and the weather was also good. It is rare to have such clear and smooth weather during the new wheat harvest. Moreover, the harvest in Jiangbei and the northern regions is even better than expected, so most people's minds have naturally changed. The only reason it is not falling sharply is due to the resistance of some factories. As a result, this month is 0.25 fen lower than the previous day, July is 1 qian higher into customs and 0.75 fen lower, August is 0.5 fen lower, September and October are 0.25 fen lower, and November is 0.75 fen lower.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Weak and Lacking Momentum</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, with the market for each month turning weak and lacking momentum. Foreign wheat quotations continued to decline, and speculative buying activity was unavoidable. In terms of the domestic situation, the factories' attitude towards new wheat in previous years has generally been eager to purchase it. However, most factories have foreign wheat in preparation, and new goods from various regions are gradually being shipped to Shanghai with favorable weather conditions. With this situation, bullish expectations seem to have suffered a major blow at the fundamental level, and the gradual loosening of each market is almost entirely due to actual market forces. As a result, this month is 0.3 fen lower than the previous day, July is 0.2 fen lower, August is unchanged, September and October are 0.2 fen lower, and November is 0.3 fen lower. The new wheat market is also weakening. Major factories have no demand, and only small factories are making slight purchases. The Nanjing wheat opened yesterday varied in quality, with the high quality opening at 3 taels and 9 qian, the medium quality at 3 taels, 7 qian and 8 fen to 3 taels and 7 qian and 2 fen, a total of 3,000 bags, purchased by Huafeng.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Futures and Spot Both See Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trade in Kehsien rice was suspended and the market was quiet. However, the foreign rice market was more active. Spot goods were sold by Tongxingtai to No. 1, Bend Street, at 200 bags of Saigon rice at a price of 11 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 fen. Futures also opened for 1,500 tons, which were purchased by Bend Street and sold by Mitsui, Tongxingtai, etc., all Mendang rice, to be shipped in the first half of July and weighed upon arrival at a price of 5 taels and 4 qian. Saigon and other rice types are also under negotiation, and further transactions are expected within the day.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Changzhou Xixiang Cocoon Trading Suspends Weighing</h3>
<p>Few Goods Arriving on the Market, Prices High and Purchases Limited. Due to the large crop failure of cocoons this year, only seven cocoon shops have opened for trading in areas such as Liheqiao Xixiang, Henglin, Changtinglu, Lucheng, Sanhekou, Shiyan, Huanqiao, Houyu, and Buqiaomenghe in Changzhou Xixiang. Few goods are arriving on the market. The trading has been open for over a week, but the total purchases by each shop are only 600-700 dan. Farmers holding high-quality cocoons are insisting on high prices before selling. Cocoon prices are rising, and high-quality foreign-bred cocoons have opened at 64-65 yuan. Each cocoon shop is generally preparing to suspend weighing.</p>
<h3>Factory Dried Silk for European Sales is Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this port was even more sluggish. The American sales of factory dried silk and second-grade silk remained suspended. Telegrams from Lyon and other places were also scarce, and transactions were difficult. Yesterday, only Mitsui and others imported 20 bales of Shanghai white factory silk and Xinfu and others imported 40 bales of white dried silk. Prices are unlikely to rise.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Zhenmei Begins Shipping</h3>
<p>After each Wuyuan shop opened for trading and began making tea, they all rushed to pick and manufacture tea and ship it to Shanghai to grab the new market. Cheng Renhe Tea Shop in Nanxiang has begun shipping the first batch of Zhenmei tea today. Other shops, after receiving telegrams from Shanghai reporting the news of the sale of 310 taels of Tunchouxin, were all overjoyed and worked day and night to rush production. Zhenmei from Xiangxin, Jitai, Jishengchang, and other shops in Beixiang can all be boxed within a few days, and a large batch of new goods will be shipped to Shanghai around the Dragon Boat Festival for display. In addition, this year's Zhenmei is of very good quality, as the raw materials are not mixed with tea from other regions and are all made from pure tea gardens. The tea leaves are tender, the color and taste are fresh, and the quality is unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Suian Zhenmei Sales Smooth, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in this port saw Suian Zhenmei green tea from Lailuzhuang, as merchants such as Yingzhuang Xiehe and Tianxiang showed a strong interest in purchasing due to the fact that Chinese merchants were asking for lower prices than before. The market has almost sold out of Zhenmei from that area, but the market has been set at 115 taels, a decrease of 10-20 taels compared to before. Although there was much negotiation for Tunxi and Wuyuan Zhenmei among traders, transactions were not smooth. The American sales of Pingshui Dabang have already started, but most are being sold in small quantities because the sales of Zhucha are quite good, while the American sales of Zhenxiu and other goods are not strong, and the prices are not matching.</p>
<h3>Tunxi New Tea Supply Falls Short of Demand</h3>
<p>This year, due to the loss of tea production in various regions, Tunxi tea shops have seen no new tea shipped to Tunxi for sale. In addition, the opening of trade was slightly delayed, and the new tea from Wuyuan Northeast was almost entirely purchased by tea shops in the area. Those who went to Wuyuan to purchase tea were mostly disappointed. New tea in the Xiuning, Kunlian, and Shexian areas was being sold at high prices due to smooth sales at stores and was being converted into green tea. New tea in Xiunan was mostly plagued by pests and suffered a major crop failure. Gan tea was blocked by bandits, so most Tunxi shops have not yet met their quota for tea purchases and are still sending people out to search for it.</p>
<h3>Fuliang Green Tea Trading Still Strong</h3>
<p>Fuliang green tea is divided into red tea and green tea. This year, the production of green tea in the southeast has suffered losses, and the mountain households are initially reluctant to sell at low prices. Currently, Wubang merchants are gathering in the area to discuss prices. Large-scale trading has already begun in Zhengjiashan and other villages, with prices ranging from 44 yuan to 50 yuan. Due to excessive buying, market prices are expected to rise.</p>
<h3>Zhangshan Tea Production Suffers Losses</h3>
<p>Zhangshan tea is known for its fame. Because of its high altitude and cold climate, the tea buds develop later. The new mountain tea began to be picked about 10 days ago and has recently been collected. According to the mountain people, tea production has suffered huge losses, only reaching 20-30% of last year's production. The production of other areas such as Gaosheshang, Liuganjian, and Shuishanshi has also decreased significantly. Merchants are negotiating and scrambling to purchase tea, and mountain households, valuing the scarcity of goods, are unwilling to sell them off immediately.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods and Woolens See Lively Retail Trade</h3>
<p>In recent days, retail trade in piece goods and woolens has been very lively. Various groups in the district have continued to replenish their supplies. Yesterday, goods such as Zhuluosha, Balene, Falane, Yushane, white Biji, and white Zhigong were sold. The Western-style clothing trade in yellow twill, gauze twill, and rubber cloth also saw significant demand. The market is very stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Rises Along with Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Icing and Green Sugar at Ten Taels and Rising</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market communications from the production area indicated that the current price of Cuban sugar was 1.3125, an increase of 0.0625 compared to the previous telegram. New York futures for September were priced at 1.33, up 2 points; December at 1.40, up 1 point; March of the next year at 1.47, unchanged; May at 1.54, also up 1 point. The current price of Javanese sugar and the June futures price were both stable, while the July-August price was 8.125, still unchanged. In the public market, the price rose along with foreign exchange, and sentiment improved. Sellers were scarce. Dutch sugar No. 24 raw white initially traded at 11 taels and 4 qian, but buying interest was shallow. Later, the market rose to 11 taels and 4 qian and 5 fen. High-quality goods were priced at 11 taels and 5 qian and 5 fen. No. 20 medium white sand was priced at 10 taels, 8 qian and 5 fen, and then shouted up to 10 taels and 9 qian. Although transactions in Japanese sugar were scarce, the market also rose. Z Mark was priced at 11 taels, 3 qian, 3 fen and 7 li, SH Mark at 11 taels and 1 qian, old goods at 11 taels and 5 fen, J Mark at 11 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen, YRo Mark at 10 taels, 9 qian and 5 fen, YT Mark at 11 taels and 3 qian, YP Mark at 11 taels and 7 qian, and Minghua goods at 11 taels and 6 qian and 5 fen. Taikoo o Mark was priced at 9 taels and 3 qian and also saw slight transactions. The market was generally firm. The factory price of icing and green sugar opened at 10 taels and demand was very high. The shop owners are still thinking of tightening prices and shouting for higher prices.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Walnut Goods Scarce and Prices High</h3>
<p>Walnuts have seen no recent arrivals, and market inventories are very scarce. Therefore, market prices have repeatedly risen and are exceptionally firm. For example, Tianjin walnuts have risen to 37-38 taels and 40 taels, while other ordinary goods also require more than 30 taels. This is indeed a rare high price. Walnut meat is currently selling for 52-53 taels. The market outlook is stable.</p>
<h3>Metals: Domestic Galvanized Iron Sheet Prices Tend to be Weak</h3>
<p>Overseas prices for galvanized iron sheet have repeatedly reported lower prices, causing the sentiment of domestic merchants to weaken. Therefore, very few people have purchased and placed orders for the later batches. It is said that a telegram from Bell City yesterday reported another drop of 5 shillings, with a price of only £16 5 shillings per ton. However, the number of domestic merchants purchasing and placing orders is still very small.</p>
<h3>Pig Lead Trends Weak</h3>
<p>The trend of pig lead is weak due to falling overseas prices, so domestic standards have also followed downstream. The lowest price is only 15 taels, 7 qian and 5 fen per dan, a drop of 2 qian and 5 fen compared to before. However, with tea merchants suspending business and paint companies and wholesale buyers not making widespread purchases, sentiment is weak and the market is empty. Therefore, the market has shown signs of a continuous softening trend.</p>

<h3>Chinese Steamer and British Warship Collide</h3>
<p>Haichang Steamship Company's Yuda Steamer</p>
<p>British Submarine Poseidon</p>
<p>Collided Near Weihaiwei</p>
<p>British Warship Sank, Yuda Slightly Damaged</p>
<p>Rescued Captain and 35 Others</p>
<p>The Yuda Steamer of Haichang Steamship Company departed from Shanghai on the 9th of this month and collided with the British submarine Poseidon northwest of Chengshan Cape, Shandong. The British warship sank and the Yuda sustained minor damage. The details of this incident are described below:</p>
<p>Collision Location: The Yuda Steamer was carrying 1,600 tons of cargo from Shanghai to Yingkou. While traveling northwest of Chengshan Cape, Shandong, about 40 nautical miles away, and about 21 nautical miles from Weihaiwei, at 12:45 PM on the 9th, the steamer was sailing on its proper course when the Poseidon submarine, stationed in the Far East, approached head-on. The Yuda, unable to yield, rammed its bow into the submarine.</p>
<p>British Warship Sinks: After being hit, the Poseidon sustained significant damage and was unable to maintain its structure. It sank into the sea after 55 minutes, at 1:30 PM, in the area of the collision. After colliding with the warship, the Yuda Steamer sent a wireless report of the sinking of the Poseidon, causing the alarm to be raised. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tunan Steamer, which was 40 nautical miles away, received the message and relayed the SOS signal, before proceeding to assist in the rescue.</p>
<p>Refusal of Ship's Rescue: After colliding with the warship, the Yuda Steamer immediately anchored and, seeing the British warship sinking, launched lifeboats into the sea to rescue the officers and soldiers on board. The Tunan Steamer also arrived to assist in the rescue. However, the British officers and soldiers refused the rescue offered by the Chinese ship. Fortunately, the British ships stationed on Liu Gong Island received the wireless alarm and rushed to assist in the rescue.</p>
<p>Many Rescued: The Poseidon had five officers and thirty soldiers on board, all of whom were rescued. The captain, Mr. Gulben, was rescued from the sinking warship by the British warships from Weihaiwei. Thirty-five officers and soldiers, including the captain, were rescued. Two had already died, while the remaining eighteen were lost with the warship and could not be rescued.</p>
<p>Rescue of Foreign Warship: After the incident, the British cruiser HMS Hermes, the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle, and the destroyers HMS Sterling, HMS Cromer, and HMS Merrison, all stationed on Liu Gong Island, sailed to assist in the rescue. The Poseidon has now sunk into the sea. The warship had a displacement of 1,475 tons and was armed with one 4-inch gun. It was newly built and had only been assigned to the China Fleet on February 1st of last year as the largest British submarine.</p>
<p>Commander's Inspection: The British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China, Mr. Cainess, received the alarm that the warship had been sunk and sailed from Hankou on a warship to inspect the site of the accident and plan the salvage operation. Yesterday afternoon, he had already sent divers into the sea to check the depth of the water, which is not yet known.</p>
<p>Inquiries About Yuda: According to sources at the Haichang Company yesterday, no telegrams have arrived since the Yuda sailed out. The Shanghai company received the wireless message relayed by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company from the Tunan, and learned that the ship had collided with the British warship. It also learned that the Yuda had only sustained minor damage to its bow and was safe. Yesterday, the company sent telegrams to Niuzhuang and to search for the Yuda Steamer to inquire about the situation. Detailed information will be available after the report is received.</p>
<p>Sunken Warship Found: Reuter's Qingdao, 10th: The British Navy search team found the sunken location of the Poseidon at 10:40 AM today after seeing bubbles rising to the surface. They are now engaged in salvage work and expect to be able to salvage the ship this afternoon. The bodies of the 18 missing people have not yet been found.</p>
<p>Number of Drowned: Reuter's Hong Kong, 10th: The naval authorities here issued a message this morning stating that the British Commander-in-Chief of the China Fleet had telegraphed that the British submarine Poseidon had been sunk 10 miles north of Weihaiwei by the Chinese merchant ship Yuda. Five crew members and thirty soldiers had been rescued, but two soldiers were confirmed dead and eighteen were missing. The submarine sank in 120 feet of water. Divers have been sent into the water to inspect the area, but the location of the sunken ship has not yet been found. However, bubbles were still seen at 9:00 PM last night. Of the 18 missing people, 12 were married and 6 were unmarried. The two dead were both married. The submarine was on the surface when it was hit at 12:45 PM. The hull was struck with a large hole and sank within minutes. The Yuda merchant ship rescued many people. Six people escaped using Davis submarine escape devices, and four people floated to the surface after being in the water for 45 minutes. Two more people were rescued by British warships after being in the water for 2 hours and 15 minutes. It is also reported that the location of the Poseidon submarine has now been found and efforts will be made to salvage it today.</p>
<h3>Yang Shuzhuang Sent a Telegram to Sun Ke Yesterday</h3>
<p>Do Not Allow Personal Grievances to Hinder National Affairs</p>
<p>Navy Minister Yang Shuzhuang has been staying in Shanghai recently, and the date of his return to Fujian is still undecided. According to a reporter for the Riri News, Yang will be able to return to Fujian after attending the Fifth Plenary Session. Yang sent a telegram to Sun Ke yesterday, which read: "To Brother Sun Zhesheng, I have read your telegram and cannot remain silent. The incident in Guangdong has caused alarm throughout the country, who all believe that internal strife is inappropriate when the nation is recovering from hardship. As the Premier's son and a senior member of the Party, you have the responsibility to mediate. I personally paid you a visit in Shanghai the other day and heard your intention to mediate disputes and support peace. I was very pleased to hear this, but that same evening I heard that you were going to Guangdong and then quickly sent this telegram. Your words are still in my ears, but your actions are like two different people. You are open and upright, and this is not your original intention. At present, the Red Peril is raging, which the people of the country are grieving over, and this is what our Party is dedicated to. We should abandon everything and work together to fight the enemy, so as to comfort the people and lay the foundation for our Party. If we start internal conflict and give others an opportunity to exploit our weaknesses, leading to destruction, it will not only undo years of hard work, but also make it difficult to justify the source of the disaster in the future. As for your criticism of me personally, perhaps it is based on the principles of Spring and Autumn, but at this time we cannot allow personal grievances to hinder national affairs. I am honored to have received your inquiry, and I dare to express my humble opinion. I ask you to consider this carefully. Yours sincerely, Yang Shuzhuang."</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods Market Still Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Staff Continue to Be Arrested</p>
<p>The Market Has Telegraphed Requests for Negotiations</p>
<p>The China Domestic United Department Store, which was ordered to close by the Public Works Department the day before yesterday, remained closed yesterday. Furthermore, staff members of the market continued to be arrested. A telegram has been sent to the authorities requesting negotiations, and representatives have been dispatched to party and government agencies to petition. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Police Protection: Important personnel of the market believe that this unexpected event has a significant impact on the future of domestic products. Therefore, yesterday morning, they appealed to various agencies and organizations for assistance, while also notifying all staff to maintain order. They wrote about the closure on the lacquered counters. However, in the morning, groups providing assistance posted angry slogans about destroying domestic goods in front of the main gate, which attracted many passersby. The police, upon learning of this situation, immediately dispatched armed Chinese and Western officers to patrol the Nanjing and Tibet Roads area for protection. By 3:00 PM, the police had removed the posted slogans, but the onlookers remained crowded. Despite repeated attempts to persuade them to disperse, they would scatter and then regroup, making it impossible to disperse them.</p>
<p>Staff Arrested: The day before yesterday, after the market was sealed, some workers attempted to leave and were insulted by the patrol officers. Two staff members, Wang Jianxin and Ye Zusheng, stepped forward to dissuade them and were immediately detained by the police. After negotiations, they were released the night before last. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, a female staff member, Cai Zurong, was detained by the police for trying to stop Western officers from tearing down slogans. She had not been released as of the evening. At 8:00 PM, Western officers saw more people posting slogans, and four staff members and apprentices were injured on the spot. They were taken to the hospital by the market's vehicle for treatment. Additionally, an apprentice named Zhu Juyong was detained.</p>
<p>Temporary Discussion: The market is actively seeking solutions to this matter. Therefore, a temporary discussion was held in the French Concession yesterday morning.</p>
<p>More than twenty people attended, including Zhao Shouyu, Zhang Zilian, Wu Shan, Ling Mianzhi, Zhang Chuling, and Li Weicheng. It was decided that representatives would be sent to the capital today to petition the central government. Meanwhile, an inventory of the goods in the market will be taken, and the Special District Court will be asked to send personnel for inspection in order to pursue legal action in the future. In the afternoon, Zhao Shouyu and Zhang Zilian took appeals to Puxi for publicity and took photographs in front of the market. Therefore, this matter cannot be resolved in the short term.</p>
<p>Representatives Petition: Yesterday morning at 12:00 PM, the Domestic Goods Market dispatched two representatives, Zhang Zi'an and Liu Musu, to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau to petition and report the situation, requesting: (1) a prompt resolution to the suffering of domestic goods merchants, and (2) efforts to abolish unequal treaties and recover the concessions. Tian Heqing of the Social Affairs Bureau received them, and Tang Jun of the Municipal Party Department received them, accepting their requests.</p>
<p>Presented to the Municipal Party Department: The following was presented to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department yesterday: "A report on the unwarranted closure of the China Domestic United Department Store by the Public Concession police, requesting your attention and prompt serious negotiations to safeguard national dignity and protect domestic goods. I, Zilian, am also a follower of the Three Principles of the People, deeply aware that promoting domestic goods is a shortcut to realizing the Principle of People's Livelihood. Therefore, I spared no effort to establish the China Domestic United Department Store on Nanjing Road in front of the former City Hall last year, engaging in a life-or-death battle with imported goods in the hope of recovering our rights and interests. On June 9th of this year, at 3:00 PM, just after moving to No. 4 Jing'an Temple Road, formerly the New World, the Public Concession police suddenly dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to order the market to close, sealing all the doors and prohibiting personnel from entering. The seriousness of their attitude is truly unbelievable. It is my humble opinion that the imperialists, relying on their unequal treaties, arbitrarily trample on our country and destroy our domestic products. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? As a party member, and as the market is under the guidance and training of your department, it is known that the survival of the China Domestic United Department Store is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. If we allow them to be slaughtered, I fear that our Chinese national spirit will never be uplifted. For the sake of the future of domestic goods and the survival of the nation, we must fight for our rights based on reason and will not give up until we achieve our goals. In addition to the united efforts of the comrades in the Chamber of Commerce and separate telegrams and appeals, I hereby present the facts to your department, requesting your serious negotiations to jointly seek victory and requesting your department to make efforts to recover the concessions. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department."</p>
<p>Telegraphed to the National Government: The following telegram was sent to the Central Party Department and the National Government in Nanjing yesterday: "To the Central Party Department, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry: In recent years, recognizing the decline of domestic goods sales and the dreadfulness of imperialist economic aggression, we established the China Domestic United Department Store on Nanjing Road in Shanghai in July of last year, raising the banner of promoting domestic goods in the area with the most prosperous commerce and the most foreign goods in the country. Since its operation, it has been repeatedly oppressed by imperialists due to its location within the British Concession. However, thanks to the support of the Chinese people, its foundation has gradually become solid. This year, in May, the market moved to No. 4 Jing'an Temple Road and continued its operations as usual. Unexpectedly, at 3:00 PM on June 9th, the British Concession police suddenly dispatched police to order the closure of the market, sealing all the doors and sending police to monitor and prohibit entry and exit. Our market, under the pressure of force, had no choice but to close. Such unwarranted oppression and hatred of our Chinese people and our domestic products is extremely infuriating. The imperialists rely on their unequal treaties to establish extraterritorial rights in our country and act arbitrarily. The tragic cases of the past were all caused by this. Now, the Chinese people are united in their efforts to negotiate, but the British imperialists do not realize their errors and instead become even more violent. This makes us feel even more urgently the need to recover extraterritorial rights. We can only request that your department instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to raise the matter of our market with the British side for serious negotiations. In addition to the British police being held responsible for the unwarranted closure of our market, we also request that the negotiations for the recovery of extraterritorial rights be intensified so that the imperialists will not dare to commit violence on our territory again. If this matter is not properly resolved, our market will sacrifice itself for patriotism and will unite with domestic organizations to fight to the end and will never give up. In addition to the united support of the party departments, governments, and agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic organizations in all provinces and cities across the country, this telegram is hereby respectfully submitted."</p>
<p>Daily Losses: A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Li Weicheng, a staff member of the market, at 5:00 PM. According to Li, domestic goods are declining, and the organization of the domestic goods market was organized by major merchants in the city. This destruction is truly unexpected. Furthermore, the responsible personnel were not present at the time, nor was there a court order. Therefore, the merchants are angry. The market's closure is causing a loss of about 5,000 yuan per day. This matter will be formally negotiated, and if necessary, legal action will be taken. Today, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, and the Municipal Domestic Goods Exhibition Hall all came to investigate and requested that their respective departments exert their utmost efforts in negotiations. Last night (i.e., the day before yesterday), a telegram was sent to the central government, and this morning (i.e., yesterday morning), a document was presented to the Municipal Party Department to negotiate.</p>
<p>Supporting Voices: The Shanghai National Goods Factories Joint Association is scheduled to hold a meeting today to support the Domestic Goods Market. Yesterday, a letter was sent stating: "The China Domestic United Department Store was suddenly closed by the Public Works Department on the 9th of this month, resulting in the suspension of business. This case is highly relevant to the international status and the promotion of domestic goods. Therefore, a special executive committee meeting will be held at the association in Jiu'anli at 2:00 PM on Thursday, the 11th of this month, to discuss solutions. We hereby request that you attend the meeting on time to discuss the matter together. We look forward to your presence."</p>

<h3>Municipal Party Department Does Not Approve the Organization of a Landlords Association</h3>

<p>A Request Should Be Made to the Municipal Government for Review</p>
<p>According to Guomin News Agency, the rent dispute events in the city have recently become a hot topic again, and the tenants are organizing associations and requesting the Municipal Party Department to approve their establishment to resist.

<p>Cheng Zhenjun Comes to Shanghai to Borrow Money</p>
<h3>Fundraising for the Capital Machine Manufacturing Factory</h3>
<p>Machine Parts and Materials Have Been Ordered from the United Kingdom</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry recently sent Cheng Zhenjun, Director of the Industrial Department, to Shanghai to contact the banking community in this city to negotiate a loan of 50 million yuan to prepare for the establishment of the Capital Machine Manufacturing Factory. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met with Mr. Cheng at his residence to ask about the preparation process and the situation of the negotiations in Shanghai. According to Mr. Cheng, the Ministry of Industry, in view of the fact that the various machines used in domestic factories are all purchased from foreign countries, and there are not many domestic products, and the machinery industry is developing rapidly, in order to develop the future of domestic industry, we have to rely on the reform and improvement of the machinery industry. To achieve this goal, we must first have our own factory to manufacture machines before we can meet its needs. The Ministry of Industry, based on this point, intends to prepare a plan to set up a machine manufacturing factory in the capital. The funds will be allocated by the National Government to the Ministry of Industry to handle the British Boxer Indemnity funds accumulated from the 20 million yuan basic business expenses as a purchase for machine parts and materials. It has now begun to order from the United Kingdom, but the construction of factory buildings and recurring expenses, working capital, etc., still require 500,000 yuan in cash. After I came to Shanghai, I contacted the Guohuo Bank and the Zhongjiao Bank to discuss borrowing. Most of them have been settled and will be realized soon.</p>

<h3>Various Industries' Tax Rules Association Request to Revise the Business Tax Law</h3>
<p>The Various Industries' Tax Rules Association of this city telegraphed the Nanjing Central Political Conference National Government Legislative Yuan yesterday, saying (above omitted): After reading the newspaper reports, the Business Tax Law has been passed by the 145th meeting of the Legislative Yuan. After carefully examining the full text, there are no amendments to the collection procedures and the outline and supplementary methods for the collection of business tax in various provinces promulgated by the Executive Yuan, but the tax rate has been uniquely increased. For example, the outline and supplementary methods stipulate that the tax rate should not exceed 2/1000 based on the turnover, and the tax rate should not exceed 20/1000 based on the capital. The tax law, in addition to adding a pure income item, collects 2/1000 to 30/1000 of the total business income, and 4/1000 to 20/1000 of the tax law based on the capital. For example, Article 2 of the supplementary method promulgated by the Ministry stipulates that business tax is exempted if the business capital is less than 500 yuan, while the tax law stipulates by category that business tax is exempted if the annual income is less than 1,000 yuan when the business turnover is used as the tax standard, and the business capital is less than 500 yuan when the business capital is used as the tax standard. When the business pure income is used as the tax standard, the business pure income is less than 100 yuan. The principle of taxation is based on the taxpayer's ability to pay. At the time of commercial decline, it is difficult to bear such a high amount of burden, and the tax exemption for the minimum living expenses is adopted by various countries in modern times. Although the tax law also has similar regulations, it is difficult to measure the extremely low living of 1,000 yuan in annual business and 100 yuan in annual income, which actually hinders the development of its industry. Moreover, the implementation of our country's business tax is completely to compensate for the losses of local tax cuts, and the collection of business tax should be based on the actual losses suffered by the tax cuts in various provinces and cities to determine the level of tax rates. It is necessary to set a high-amount limit in the tax law, and there is no need to have a starting tax rate, so that various provinces and cities can freely expand and contract within a certain limit to suit their actual situation, so that the national economy and the people's livelihood can be considered in a unified manner. The 理合 telegraphs and requests the 钧会府院 to carefully amend the bill before it is promulgated, except for those that are indeed luxury businesses and those that contain suppression attributes that should be listed and stipulated. The standard is not more than 2/1000, and the tax standard based on the capital is at most not more than 2/1007. If the capital is less than 500 yuan, the tax is waived to ease the difficulties of commerce and benefit the implementation of the temporary telegraph. The research committee of the Shanghai Municipal Industries Association has studied the tax rules.</p>
<h3>Change of Date for the Foundation Stone Laying of the New Municipal Government Building</h3>
<p>To Be Held on July 7</p>
<p>The foundation stone laying ceremony for the new municipal government building, which the municipal government is preparing to build in the downtown area, was originally scheduled to be held on July 1. It is learned that the municipal government has decided to change the date of the foundation stone laying ceremony from July 1 to July 7 because the anniversary of the establishment of the municipal government is July 7. It is also heard that invitation cards will be issued to all sectors of the city for viewing at that time.</p>
<p>[PInternational Trade Association to Conduct Business Registration&gt;</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the China International Trade Association has developed its affairs quite well. The important functions of the association are to introduce direct trade. The first step is to investigate the situation of various import and export merchants and related import and export manufacturers and their business operations. The premise of the investigation is to conduct registration of import and export merchants and manufacturers, and a form has been drafted and distributed to various places. Merchants operating export trade and domestic manufacturers of exported goods are requested to come to the association to register in order to sort them out separately for the preparation of introducing direct trade. If the merchants of various import and export firms in the city and other places have not received this registration form, they will be informed at any time to write to the association on the fourth floor of the Shanghai Hankou Road Jianghai Customs for re-mailing.</p>
<h3>Temporary Exemption of Testing Fees for Raw Silk</h3>
<p>The Commodity Inspection Bureau Has Notified the Shanghai-Wuxi Silk Factory Association. The quality of raw silk is difficult to determine without precise testing, and the accuracy of the testing depends entirely on the excellent machinery and perfect methods. In order to enable various silk factories to make full use of the equipment of the Raw Silk Inspection Office of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, and to understand the latest testing methods and research the quality of silk produced by factories, from yesterday onwards, any silk factory requesting inspection of the quality of raw silk (uniformity, cleanliness, cleanness, strand division, broken ends, etc.) will be temporarily exempted from fees to promote it. The procedures for requesting inspection and the sampling methods have been sent to various silk factories and the Shanghai-Wuxi Silk Factory Association for reference. The procedures for requesting inspection and the sampling methods are recorded below (1) Silk factories that wish to request inspection of the quality of raw silk must open the name of the silk factory, the name of the silk brand, the number of strands, the number of sample silk strands, and the items requested for inspection, and send the sample silk to the Raw Silk Inspection Office of the Bureau. A receipt will be issued, and the inspection will be awaited (2) The procedure for collecting sample silk is stipulated in the Detailed Rules for Raw Silk Inspection of the Bureau. Each package must be sampled with 10 strands of silk. If you want to know the quality of every 5 packages, then each package should be sampled with 4 strands of silk, totaling 20 strands. If the various silk factories have special reasons why they cannot follow the above regulations, they can also sample freely, but each time at least 25 strands must be sent. After the quality inspection of the silk samples is completed, the Bureau will issue a certificate, and the remaining silk samples will be collected by the requester at the Bureau. In order to make the silk factories understand the inspection procedures, they can send personnel to the Bureau for observation. The inspection personnel will explain the various inspection procedures at any time to facilitate popularization.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Notice of Annual Meeting</h3>

The Association's Call Announcement and Notice to various trade associations and shops to quickly promote delegates and pay membership fees have all been issued.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks to Set a Deadline for Penalties for Missing Stamp Tax</h3>
<p>Do Not Pursue Old Cases and Impose Harsh Taxes</p>
<p>Should Be Limited to One Year</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Jiangsu Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau yesterday, saying that on the 9th of this month, it received a letter from the Rice Industry Association, saying that its members Suilong, Yuantai Gong, Yushuntai, Dexing and other rice shops had reported to the association one after another that the Public Security Bureau had sent police to fine the shops for failing to affix stamp tax to invoices, and the penalties ranged from 100 yuan to tens of yuan. The checks of the Stamp Tax Bureau are all old things, and there are even cases where the fine has been imposed several years ago. Repeatedly harsh demands and fines on the merchants are unbearable. We request that you uphold justice and forward the matter to the Stamp Tax Bureau to set a standard deadline so as to avoid long-term harassment. The Stamp Tax Bureau punishes various rice shops for failing to affix stamp tax to invoices, but the so-called invoices that have been missed are all old invoices, and even invoices from ten years ago have long been cut off. Occasionally, because they do not dislike customers, they pick up and report them, and the Stamp Tax Bureau uses them as evidence for punishment. It is not known that the invoices found are all waste invoices from previous years and not evidence of current prices. According to the principle that the law does not pursue the past, they cannot be used as a basis for punishment. Such limitless and indiscriminate fines are close to harsh taxes. Therefore, the executive committee of the affiliated association decided to request the Stamp Tax Bureau to set a standard deadline from January 1 of this year onwards. All missing invoices found before January 1 of this year will be exempt from punishment. If it is after January 1, the matter will be handled in accordance with the regulations. In this way, the boundaries will be clear and there will be no more disturbances. We remember that things like this are not only the suffering of the industry, but it is expected that all industries have suffered such pain. Therefore, we suggest that the 钧会 submit it to the standing committee for discussion and forward it to the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau for handling. We check that various cases, such as criminal penalties, the acquisition and loss of rights, and laws, all have a certain period of limitation, so as to avoid the uncertainty of the relationship forever and disrupt the social order. Stamp tax has frequent contact with the people, and there is no doubt that it should have a period of limitation. According to the current regulations, the articles and clauses are too simple and there are no detailed regulations, but the stamp tax is checked regularly every year, which is equivalent to making a settlement every period, and the inspection should have a boundary. Moreover, the previous methods of stamp tax in this city were inconsistent, and many industries had a certain amount of recognition each year. If we want to pursue old cases for many years with different methods of leniency and strictness, it would be unfair in terms of sentiment and reason. We should be allowed to handle cases of missing affixation in accordance with the request of the Association. The cases of missing affixation should be limited to those issued within one year of the year, so as to avoid harsh taxes. We hope to see your reply.</p>

<p>Picking Up Gold and Silver Turns into Copper</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau is thoroughly investigating the matter. Zhang Asan, a worker at Gu's Tofu Shop on Pingyuan Lane, Doushi Road, Wusong, went to the riverbank in front of the Tongxing Wharf on Wai Ma Road at 3:00 PM the other day to fetch water. He unintentionally found 17 pieces of jewelry such as gold and silver bracelets and chains in the mud and sand at the bottom of the river. For a time, the news spread far and wide as a strange event. The details were recorded in the newspaper on the 9th. Unexpectedly, things took an unexpected turn. After Zhang found the jewelry, because it was identified as genuine and of great value, he couldn't help but be overjoyed and took it home. The next day, Zhang was planning to take the jewelry to a nearby silver shop to exchange it for money when suddenly Tan, a water carrier from the Qunxian Tea House, also found more than ten pieces of similar jewelry at the same location. His joy was no less than Zhang's. However, Tan was more careful than Zhang. He tried to cut one of the pieces into two sections, only to find that it was a purple copper strip plated with gold and silver. He then cut all the pieces and found that they were all copper. He then went to Zhang's place to tell him the situation. Zhang initially didn't believe it, but when he cut the bracelets and chains he had found, he found that none of them were genuine. Zhang was disappointed. After careful study of the counterfeit jewelry, it was found that more than 30 pieces of counterfeit jewelry were marked with the hard seal of Tiancheng Silver Shop, which was no different from the genuine ones on the market. After this news spread, there was a lot of discussion for a while, but no one knew where this large batch of counterfeit jewelry came from or why it was abandoned on the riverbank. It was very strange. After the Public Security Bureau learned of this news yesterday, it was obvious that unscrupulous people were specializing in manufacturing this kind of counterfeit jewelry to deceive ignorant villagers and make money. There must be many victims, and the matter was bizarre, so police detectives have been sent to thoroughly investigate and prosecute the case.</p>
<p>Two Bandits Executed by Shooting Yesterday</p>
<p>One was Wang Zhixiang from Ningbo, and the other was Yang Wu from Jiangbei.</p>
<p>The bandit Wang Zhixiang (also known as Wang Bizui and Wang Haixiang) from Ningbo, 37 years old, colluded with accomplices to kidnap Liang Huibao on Penglu Road on December 6, 1927, and kidnapped Shi Jiufeng on Xinji Bang Road on February 24, 1928, and kidnapped Wu Songyan on Qipu Road on September 3, and kidnapped Wu Fangpu on Xizang Road on October 25, and absconded with the money. He was arrested by Detective Wang Changgeng of the Old Gate Police Station last winter. The Special District Local Court found the charges to be true and sentenced him to death on March 31 of this year. The sentence was submitted to the higher authorities for review. Now, the provincial order has been received to execute the bandit by shooting in accordance with the law. Yesterday afternoon, the police station was notified, and Detective Wang Changgeng went to the West Prison to extract the bandit for questioning by Judge Cheng Shangfeng, who asked if he had any last words. The bandit confessed that he was guilty of kidnapping and that since he was about to be executed, he asked to be notified to his sister at No. 90 Xichengli, Ximen Road to collect his body. Judge Cheng Shangfeng was also notified that the bandit Yang Wu from Jiangbei, who was sentenced to death for kidnapping Ding Zhiren, the manager of a certain flour factory on Mo Qian Shan Road, on December 19 last year, had also been ordered to be executed by shooting in accordance with the law. Therefore, he immediately ordered the police to take Wang to the court and bring Yang to the court for questioning. The bandit sang loudly as soon as he left the waiting room, and he kept singing to the court, smiling forcibly. The judge asked if he had any last words. He said that he would be shot today, but please inform his wife at Peng Wansheng's shop opposite the Fifth District Third Branch of the Hu Jia Mu Bridge to collect his body. He had nothing else to say, but he begged for some wine and food. The judge ordered wine to be prepared for the two bandits, Wang and Yang, to eat together. After they finished eating, the case files and photos were handed over to the detective in charge to escort them to the execution ground of the Jiangsu Second Prison on the River Jing. Shanghai District Court Prosecutor Junjian was notified in advance to be the supervising officer. Police Chief Xu Jinqing and police officer Chen Xihui supervised the execution police Gu Hanqing, Xue Bingzhang, Hu Xianglin, Xu Guoguang, and Cai Zuoqing, and others, rushed to the execution ground. After the prisoner transport vehicle arrived, the supervising prosecutor verified the identity of the two bandits. The execution police then tied them up in accordance with the law and shot them separately.</p>
<p>The Case of Chinese and Foreign Pharmacy Selling Poisons</p>

The pharmacy's shareholders Qu Wei Jie (also known as Qiao Zihang, who opened Wanfeng Wood Shop in Pudong), manager Su Renjie, accountant Wang Xilan (also known as Wang Ting Lai), and other ten people were escorted to the Special District Local Court for investigation. The court concluded the trial and issued a verdict. The court was held yesterday morning by Court President Xu Jia Shi. The defendants were ordered to be brought to the court, and the main text of the judgment was read out, stating that Su Renjie and Qiao Zihang, namely Qu Fengjie, were sentenced to three years of imprisonment for jointly selling morphine and opium, and each was fined 5,000 yuan. Wang Ruilan and Sun Chunsheng were sentenced to two years of imprisonment for jointly selling morphine and opium, and each was fined 4,000 yuan. If the fines could not be paid, they would be converted to imprisonment in proportion to the total amount and the number of days in a year. Qian Genmei and Qiu Ada were sentenced to six months of imprisonment for helping to sell morphine and opium, and each was fined 200 yuan. If the fines could not be paid, they would be converted to imprisonment at a rate of two yuan per day. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined to be offset by one day of imprisonment for every two days. The morphine, opium, high root, Cafeine, Xigeen, red pills, red powder, opium smoking and manufacturing utensils, the price of the tobacco sold, counterfeit banknotes, and gas pistols were confiscated according to the list. Zhu Gao, Cao Chengen, Zhang Shiqi, and Du Shutian were found not guilty. After the judgment, the police lawyer Ru Bao Yi stood up and declared that the police station would abandon the appeal against the four defendants who were declared not guilty. Court President Xu then released the four people in court.</p>
<p>Massacre on the Canute Steamer</p>
<p>A Filipino Committed Murder</p>
<p>Thirty-three People Were Killed or Injured</p>
<p>Chinese Sailors Killed or Injured</p>
<p>Labor Union Meeting for Bereavement</p>
<p>The details of the tragic incident of the Filipino massacre on the British Changxing Company's Canute steamer are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The steamer was coming from the Americas and was one day away from Yokohama (i.e., June 5). There were more than 30 third-class passengers from the Philippines. One of them, named Bilas Gracian, 42 years old, was armed with a sharp knife and randomly slashed people on the ship, killing anyone he saw. Two innocent people were killed and 31 were injured.</p>
<p>(2) The names of the deceased were Chen Ru (other name), 40 years old, from Sihui, Guangdong. He had an 80-year-old mother, a wife, two sons, and two daughters, all of whom were young. He was a carpenter on the ship. Chen Ru was honest and highly respected by his colleagues. His innocent death was mourned by his colleagues and friends. Yu You Tang, who worked as a second-class worker on the ship, was also unfortunately killed.</p>
<p>(3) The names of the injured workers in the common cabin section were Zhang Qiao, Huang Hong, Huang Rong, and Bing Guang. The workers in the building section were Deng Cheng, Ou Tai, Ou Bao, Chen Tan, Zeng Gui, Zhong An, Zeng Bao, and Lin Shaoxi. The workers in the sailor section were He Fa. The Japanese workers included a translator and a second cook. The Westerners included a storeroom worker and a water pipe worker. The Chinese passengers included Wu En Yi, Ze Pang, Rong Que, Liu Ji Pu, Qiu Fa, and Fang Wei, among others. The Japanese passengers included Nishimoto Sekitaro, Kichibo Yagoro, Nakamura Namie, Sawa Mitisu, Wataru Sonomura, and Konon Seizo, among others.</p>
<p>(4) Ou Tai, Ou Qing, Chen Tan, Zeng Gui, Zhong An, the Japanese translator, and Chinese passenger Qiu Fa were hospitalized in Japan due to serious injuries.</p>
<p>(5) At the beginning of the incident, no one knew because the murderer killed people in a way that was difficult to prevent. At the same time, the people who were killed or injured did not make a sound (because they were severely injured by sharp knives), so he was able to kill or injure more than 30 people, and only two people were killed before the situation became serious. Then, all the sailors and Westerners on the ship bravely captured him. At that time, the murderer fled to a storeroom and used a steel plate to cover it. The workers saw him hiding and fired two shots, but missed. The murderer had no choice but to surrender. After this incident occurred, some people thought that the murderer was suffering from mental illness, and some people thought that he was a murderer party or a fascist party. Later, the captain ordered the search of the Filipino passengers' luggage. As a result, a similar sharp knife was found. It can be seen that the murderer was not suffering from mental illness, but seemed to have planned to kill people.</p>
<p>(6) After this incident occurred, the Japanese government lodged a serious protest because Japanese people were killed or injured. The shipowner replied that he would guarantee compensation of 800,000 yuan to the injured Japanese. However, the Chinese, especially the Chinese sailors, lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Chinese Consulate, requesting bereavement, but not only was there no result, but they did not reply and wanted to stop the workers' wages.</p>
<p>(7) Because bereavement was not obtained, only self-fundraising was possible. Therefore, a meeting of all the ship's workers and sailors was convened. The meeting was convened on the evening of June 9. The situation was as follows: Secretary Hu Ji announced the reason for the meeting and briefly stated the process of meeting with the shipowner. The shipowner said that the shipowner was not responsible for the tragic incident and could only reply after the government's trial. As for bereavement, there would be a way to do it after the trial. Seeing this situation, all the workers had to raise funds first to comfort the dead and help the injured with medical expenses. A total of 114 yuan was donated, and 200 yuan was donated from the company's Yu Xian Le Ju community fund and distributed to the families of the two deceased. At the same time, each of the injured was given 50 yuan by the Yu Xian Le Ju community as medical expenses, and a memorial service was scheduled to be held in the ship's cabin at 2:00 PM on the 11th.</p>
<p>The tram on Xin Kai He Road was out of service for two quarters yesterday</p>
<p>The reason was to repair the broken line</p>
<p>At 1:35 PM yesterday, the overhead wire on tram F36 on the No. 6 route running between the Sixteenth Pier and the Xie Bridge suddenly broke and fell on a pole near the Jinliyuan accounting firm on Xin Kaihe Road. The broken line was immediately covered in fire, but luckily the line did not injure any pedestrians when it fell. The tram services of the International Settlement and the French Concession were thus suspended for half an hour. The transport was only returned to normal after the French tram company sent workers to fix the break.</p>

<p>Investigating and Prohibiting Circular Bonds</p>
<p>Issued by the Netherlands International Trust Company</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau received instructions from the Municipal Government yesterday, stating that the Ministry of the Interior has consulted on a case in which the Propaganda Department of the Central Executive Committee reported that the Fujian Provincial Party Affairs Steering Committee had found that the Netherlands International Trust Company had issued circular bonds and inquired about the nature of the bonds and whether they had been approved for sale. The Ministry replied that the matter belonged to the scope of real estate and other competent authorities and requested that it be verified and replied. It also replied that this kind of circular bond was purely speculative gambling and had not been submitted for approval to sell. It should be strictly investigated and prohibited. In addition to issuing separate orders and consulting on the matter, it is requested that the authorities be informed and instructed to strictly investigate and prohibit the bonds. After receiving the order, the bureau ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to find out whether the circular bonds had been sold in the city and to report back quickly for handling.</p>

<h3>Regular Hearing for the "Daji" Ship Case</h3>
<p>16th of This Month</p>
<p>Since the family representatives of the victims of the "Daji" ship tragedy, Wang Yiqing and Hou Baili, entrusted lawyers Wu Chengyu and Huang Dehua to handle the matter of seeking redress, and because the Dada Company has not made any concrete offers, the family members held a meeting on May 20th. They resolved to continue to have the two lawyers, Wu and Huang, pursue legal action to seek a fair judgment and comfort the souls of the deceased. It is now reported that the Shanghai Local Court has accepted the case and issued summonses, scheduling a hearing for 2 PM on the 16th of this month. Considering that hundreds of people tragically perished in the fire and drowning, their grievances sunk to the bottom of the sea, people from all walks of life are indignant. It seems that there is still a glimmer of hope to redress their grievances, and that justice, humanity, and the law will uphold fairness. It is reported that representatives of the families of the victims have sent letters to various organizations, groups, and fellow citizens, requesting them to attend the hearing to uphold justice. The original petition is transcribed below: It is for those who tragically perished in the fire and drowning that we are compelled to submit this petition, requesting prompt investigation of the case, adjudication of compensation for damages, and also requesting approval for</p>

<p>Legal Aid. The "Daji" ship of the Great Dada Company sailed to the Longjusha area of Zhaogao Zhanghuanggang at 5:45 PM on February 11th of this year. The ship suddenly burst into thick smoke and was engulfed in flames. Alas, innocent passengers suffered from the unforeseen disaster and were caught off guard, either injured or drowned, all on the verge of death, their grievances sinking to the bottom of the sea. Alas, who does not have parents? Who does not have a wife and children? If the deceased were children, who would they rely on for support? If the survivors are wives and children, who will they look to for sustenance? Thinking of this, the deceased cannot rest in peace, and the living cannot bear it. The plaintiffs, out of family affection, feel the pain to the core. Upon hearing the shocking news, they all cried out. After detailed investigation, it became clear that the cause of the disaster was entirely due to the company's negligence in management and dereliction of duty. Therefore, the plaintiffs entrusted lawyers Wu and Huang to send a letter to the company, urging them to provide a concrete plan for compensation. However, the company not only failed to provide a satisfactory response but also blamed the soldiers on board for throwing cigarette butts. It is truly unknown by what magic the company can evade responsibility. It is unknown if the matter of throwing cigarette butts did not occur but to hear that the throwing of a cigarette butt would immediately lead to a fire has never been previously known. If there were any, it must be the Company. The company clearly knew that the nature of saltpeter was sufficient to damage ships or endanger the health of sailors or passengers, but not only did they not prohibit its transportation, but they also failed to consider whether the saltpeter was securely packaged and stacked it in the hold with ordinary cargo, allowing soldiers to sit on the cargo at will. No wonder a single cigarette butt caused an explosion without leaving anything behind. Even if they had a hundred mouths, it would be difficult to deny that it was due to negligence in management and dereliction of duty. As for the company's statement that the issue of family compensation has been decided by the Shipping Association and that they are not liable for compensation or relief, it has no legal basis. The decision of the Shipping Association is not a mandatory regulation and cannot be used as a defense. Moreover, Article 101 of the Maritime Law clearly stipulates that the transportation of passengers shall be governed by the provisions concerning the transportation of goods, except as otherwise provided in this section. According to the provisions of Article 91 of the same law, the company shall be liable for damages, but they still try to evade and quibble. How can they escape the reach of the law? Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 194 of the Civil Code, we are compelled to submit this petition, requesting your court to promptly summon the defendants and order them to compensate the bereaved families with condolence money, benefiting both the living and the dead. Moreover, the plaintiffs are mostly from Jiangbei, where the land is barren and the people are poor. If they have to pay litigation costs, they or their families will inevitably suffer from hardship. Furthermore, this case is not one where it is difficult to hope for success. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 130 of the Civil Procedure Law, we humbly request your court to examine and approve legal aid. It would be truly beneficial. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Local Court.</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Beijing-Shanghai Section Car Services Union Request Supplemental Bonuses</h3>
<p>The year-end bonuses for the 19th year for employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways were calculated at 20% of the operating profit, originally amounting to one and a half months' salary, but only one month's salary was paid.

<h3>Disaster Relief in Nanyang, Henan, Suspended</h3>
<p>Report from the China International Famine Relief Commission</p>
<p>China International Famine Relief Commission: Currently, in addition to distributing emergency relief in Mianchi, Henan, we are continuing labor-for-relief in Nanyang. We have now received a letter from a gentleman in the county detailing the disaster situation. The tools for labor-for-relief have been almost completely lost, and work has been completely suspended. To this day, we are unable to provide assistance, even to save lives. We are deeply saddened. We have managed to obtain the following letter, which we respectfully present: "Respected Sirs, A letter was mailed to you on May 27th, detailing the tragic state of affairs in our county, where bandits attacked and breached the North Gate, committing arson, murder, and plunder. Since the fourth day of the fourth month, when the city was besieged for a week before they left, no area within a hundred li of the surrounding countryside has been spared. Cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, pigs, sheep, chickens, and dogs have all been looted, and farming tools have been burned to the ground. The bandits split into two groups, one attacking Xinye and the other attacking Tangxian. The Lihu labor-for-relief center in Zhaoying was originally the old site from the previous year. Five rooms of the houses were burned down, and most of the work tools were burned. The Red Cross Society has been sending teams to carry the injured to the hospital for treatment and bury the dead. The two gangs of bandits total more than 30,000 people. If measures are not taken to suppress them, the cities, towns, and villages of Nanyang are likely to be spared. The wheat seedlings have withered in the ground, and no one dares to go and harvest them. The construction project has been completely suspended, and there is a shortage of both manpower and livestock. Based on the general situation, work cannot start until mid-June. More than a dozen stonemasons have been abducted; the exact number is still under investigation. We hereby report this to you." As for the request to report to the National Government, the Society, in addition to disaster relief, does not participate in external affairs.</p>

<h3>Suicide by Hanging Due to Denial of Wage Advance</h3>
<p>The Sorrow of Ding Yuguan's Elderly Mother</p>
<p>Ding Yuguan, a native of Ningbo, was only twenty-three years old. He worked as a servant at the residence of a certain Mr. in Tongfu Road No. 27, earning a monthly wage of five yuan. He also had an elderly mother who relied on him for support. Last month, Ding's mother, Sun Shi, came to Shanghai from their hometown and has been staying ever since. She now intends to return to her hometown and asked Ding for twenty yuan to use as travel expenses and household expenses. Ding then turned to his employer for a wage advance. However, his employer sternly refused. In despair, he conceived the idea of suicide. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, he hanged himself on the balcony of his employer's house. When his mother saw him through a crack in the wall, she rushed to rescue him, but he had already lost his breath and died. The case was reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched detectives to carry the body to the morgue on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo of the Special District Local Court arrived at the morgue to examine the body and inquire into the cause of death. After a thorough investigation, he ordered Ding Sun Shi to sign a guarantee and take possession of the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Broken Leg from Jumping Off a Car on Longhua Road</h3>
<p>The Tragedy of Shen Rongfa</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Public Bus Company operates public buses from Laoximen to Erlu Road in Longhua. Yesterday (the 10th) at 12:00 PM, driver Yan Tiechen, driving car No. 17 on the Erlu route, was turning around at the final stop in Laolonghua when suddenly a group of more than ten workers from the Longhua Arsenal were playing there. One of the workers, named Shen Rongfa, was playing a game of jumping onto the car, but his hand did not grip the iron bar firmly. The car had already started moving, and he suddenly lost his footing and fell to the ground, his right leg crushed by the rear wheel of the car. He immediately lost consciousness and bled profusely. The factory sent people to transport the injured worker by car to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. It is heard that his life is not in danger, but the driver, Yan Tiechen, was taken to the Sixth District Third Sub-station of the Public Security Bureau by Inspector Jia for questioning. After a thorough investigation, the sub-station prepared a report and submitted it to the General Bureau for review and interrogation.</p>
