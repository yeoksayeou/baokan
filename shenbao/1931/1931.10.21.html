<p>白里安與中日互換意見冀覓取解决方式</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聨理事會今對於滿洲問題之討論、已發生劇變、因今夜該會忽發出布告稱、今因缺少正確消息、及須靜待新發展起見、理事會對於該問題之討論、已决定無期延會云云、該布告並稱、法外長白里安以代理會長之名義、仍將盡力於調解工作、並隨時報告於理事會、（十九日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）法外長白里安在滿案雙方間竭力斡旋今日與中日代表　後晤談渠與日代表芳澤之談話、大都是交換意見所談究爲何事、非至開行政會時殆不能知之、白里安須向行政會報告其拉攏雙方接近之努力經過也、無論行政會或有關之任何一方提出何種建議、目前尚談不到解决難題之定計畫、總之、趨向解决之各種建議不可不有充分彈性庶有可得一般同意之機會、在談判不至更切實程度時、可能的協定之根據、當然未便宣佈、以免礙及其成功、聞行政會所擬之各　　建議、　在東京考慮中中代表施肇基與白里安晤商四十分鐘、晤後施語人、未討論切實提議談話僅以交換意見爲限目前一般印象似以爲現尚未有多大進步以趨向實際解决法之覓得、但聞白里安現仍　續努力、以便利中日政府間之直接談判、據可恃方面云、行政會向中日兩國提出之辦法、仍不外乎九月間所提出者之輪船廓贊　與否、繫於東京與南京、惟行政會不願堅執一成不變之辦法、如雙方能覓得解决根據、行政會定欣然承諾之、可無疑也今日關於滿案之私人談話、不以白里安與中外代表之討論爲限、蓋中代表施博士在與白里安晤談後復往見英外相李定、而李定後又接見美代使吉爾白也、中日代表皆以其與白里安談話　結　電告政府、在未接覆電時、國聨行政會未必開會、據確實消息法意德梛四國代表已請中日兩國政府注意於非戰公約下之義務、出席行政會之他國代表亦將有同樣行動、現尚待政府訓令、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）白里安接見中日兩國代表、對於芳澤請其指定撤兵日期、對於施肇基請其告知國民政府關於尊重條約曁保護日僑所採　法、中日兩國覆文、大約明日可到、此間中日兩國代表各將行政院主席意見、賡續報告本國、并請本國政府對於新事變之發生予以防止、勿使爭端愈趨惡劣、本日午後情形、大槪如是、日本所提條件、仍諱莫如、據本社所知、芳澤對於純粹的政治要求、業已放棄、但九一五年五月所訂協定、關於商租地畝曁雜居權利似要求擴大範圍而推行於滿洲全境、此外國民黨所不承認之條約、亦一併要求尊重、中國代表團對於此種要求、謂當依照華府會議關於登記條約之規定辦理、但此一規定、有無追溯效力、尚待研究、今晚情形大致較佳、原因美國參加以後而滿洲問題之討論、實與爭端本身同一重要、前此國聨會僅以防止某處戰爭爲事、此層似已辦到、此際解决方法、經有利害關係之第三者參加、未便以意爲之、日本對於美國參加、仍復嚴重反抗層未可斷其必有芳澤對本社記者聲言、在未奉到幣原外相之訓令以前、仍採取保留態度、此方變化未可漠視、日本代表若以等待訓令爲口實、不願出席公開會議、則意外事件之來仍有可虞、（十九日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今夕此問咸認滿案自經白里安與中日兩總代表終日接洽後、業已大有進步、不遇仍須待鉅大讓步、方能解决、因中國現仍拒絶中日兩政府間直接談判、而日本亦依　不允規定撤兵期限、惟除此兩點外雙方態度已較前緩和、理事會現希望白里安與雙方接洽後、將能商定一方式、保證日　迅行　兵、　同時由中國增加保護日僑之保障、因撤兵與保護日僑兩事解决、其餘自迎刃而解故今夕此間已有充分樂觀、希望理事會將能開一公開會議、以結束其月來之工作、當今夕六時白里安與施肇基晤商時、中代表圈發言人發談片、力闢芳澤致理事會照會内所稱滿洲混亂狀况之無稽、謂日兵之强駐中國領士、實爲滿洲地方最足以引起憤恨與糾紛之原素、中國軍隊見其領土被日軍强佔後已月、仍能深自忍耐、免肇釁端、足見中國軍隊之有紀律與聽受約束、中國旣能在滿洲以外各地維持治安、自能在滿洲維持治安但此項保　須根據於日軍之撤回滿鐵附屬地、其理顯然甚明云云、（十九日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）白里安與芳澤及國聨會秘書長原定於本日正午會晤、芳澤當以日本五項要求及該國對於白里安建議各節之意見相告、屆時芳澤謂因東京訓令未到、請求改期、（二十日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）行政會之活動、現暫時中止、以待中日兩國答覆行政會所提出解决滿洲問題之試騐的計畫、今日恐未必開會、惟晚間如接到覆文、則今夜或仍將開會、今日白里安續與芳澤及施肇基談話、蓋行政會提出之計畫、今仍在肧胎階級中也、目下中日兩國仍各以緊急公文致國聨秘書處、報告滿洲之軍事現局、中國代表團接南京來電、内含張學良之通報、及十月十六日至十九日之事實、謂日飛機仍在各處抛擲炸彈、而瀋陽日領事則否認日飛機以炸彈轟擊通遼死十四人之說、謂攻通遼者、乃蒙人云、又謂十月十四日出現通遼天空之飛機六架、必爲民用飛機、奉命援救大倉公司巨田之僱員二十八人者蓋恐華人加害也、鄭家屯日領事報告蒙人攻擊情形、又謂日軍事當局曾派兵八十名、乘鐵甲車往救該處之韓人、並查視鄭家屯至通遼之鐵路線、（該路用日資造成）不意火車脫軌、爲華兵轟擊、於是日軍事當局又派來福槍兵一百五十名前往救助云云、（二十日路透社電）</p>

<p>根本要點共五項其野心灼然可見</p>
<p>（東京）日本在撤回鐵路區域外軍隊以前、必欲中國在原則上承認之基本要點五項、巳送交國聨行政會議長白野安國聨秘書長德魯蒙及美國國務卿史汀生、據可恃方面傳出之消息、此五要點如下、（一）中日相互擔保各不侵略、並保障彼此之土地完整、（二）中國境内各種排日形式、連抵制在内須永遠取銷、（三）保障中國境内日人生命與財産之安全、（四）償付用以敷造滿洲各鐵路之日欵、並承認滿洲敷造鐵路之現有條約、（五）承認現有之條約權利、連日人在滿租地之問題在内、（二十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）聞國聨行政會議長白里安已表示其意、渠自信能勸中國接受日本所提出根本要點五項之四、而可無多大困難、惟中國須承認日本鐵路權、以此爲開始談判之先决辦法一項、則勸日本放棄之、就今晚此間可靠方面所傳之消息觀之、白里安似以爲中國最後亦可承認此項要求、惟急欲使中國在原則上接受此點殊感困難、如日本堅持接受此原則而後開議、則談判將一時不能開始、今晚日本官塲顯抱更大樂觀、咸以爲全部問題之難點、現集於日本之要求中國先承認其在滿洲之條約權利、連同因二十一條要求而得之一九一五年條約權利在内、按南京以爲此約係在威迫之下簽定者、故始終不承認此種權利、但日人則謂如南京所持之理由爲正確、則許多條約、連同凡爾塞和約即産生國聨者、亦將認爲無效、日人據此反駁、欲中國在開議之前、先承認所有條約權利、至少在原則上承認之日人以爲此次滿洲時局之發展、皆由於中國不承認日本所認爲據約應有之權利而起云、（二十日路透社電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）日大使出淵今日通知美國務卿史汀生、日本已不反對美代表列理事席會、又謂日軍業將戰鬥飛機由滿洲調回朝鮮、而陸軍亦已撤回一小隊、滿洲時局大有進步、瀋陽秩序已復、銀行開業、無線電台不日亦可通報、滿洲境内各鐵路大多數已照常通車、並向史氏保證不致再有日軍用飛機向中國城鎭抛擲炸彈情事、故今日此間官塲漸多樂觀、以爲遠東戰禍將可避免、（十九日國民社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美政府將聨合國聨行政會以援用凱洛格非戰公約、俾阻止中日間因滿洲事件而起之戰爭、但聞美國因愼重從事、不欲在此事中居於領袖地位、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）出席國聨理事會之美國代表未曾發一語、始終傍聽、將會議情形報告本國政府、（十九日日聨社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）華盛頓傳來日本已撤銷對於美國參加國聨行政會討論滿洲問題事之反對一說、此間日人方面認爲稍有錯誤、蓋以爲日本不反對吉爾白參加行政會之討論、但不願行政會忽視因此而起之憲法問題也、日本已於星期日致行政會之牒中說明日本不能視美代表之列席、乃手續問題、此事日本保留至將來再議云、日</p>

<p>國人應有極堅强之表示</p>
<p>國聨鑒於中日問題形勢之險惡。恐一旦戰事爆發。有損國聨之尊嚴面目。故不得不極力拉攏美國。冀以歐美一致之力。挽救中日間千鈞一髮之危局。然其結果。僅仍以非戰公約勸告兩方。而日本仍崛强不受。國聨陷入此進退維谷之僵局後雖已授權白里安。向中日洽商。但仍未覔得解决之途徑。今且有形勢劇變無期延會之訊。國聨之情勢如此。而我國愈危。</p>
<p>國聨此次之出力。目的全在維持世界和平之破裂而於中日間之孰爲冤抑。孰爲强佔。本非所計。自理事會二次召集以來。與會各國之意向。皆以日本單方面之意旨爲轉移。對於日本違背上次理事會議决之撤兵案。及轟炸錦州等種種暴横行爲。並未絲毫提及。蓋皆懼日本之態度强硬。無法使之就範。此次用不講是非專講和平之非戰公約。雙方勸告日人猶且强詞狡辨。諉爲不涉該約。悍然不允撤兵。則其蠻横無理之態度已可想見。國聨於此。旣不敢援用會章有效之制裁方法。又不用九國協定以處理此事。而僅以接洽調停之方式冀得接近塗徑。日人於此。一方用其平日之預備功夫。將揑飭之聲明書等續續發表一方則用其威嚇手段。向國聨進逼我國方面。則默無一言。於此情勢之下。難保國聨不爲日本所懾服。而有不利於我之主張。使我滿腔義憤。一筆抺煞而無可聲訴。蓋今日國聨之勢力。壓迫强國則不足。壓迫弱國則有餘故我國在此至危極險關頭。應亦有極堅强不屈忍死不辱之主張表示。假使今日所傳無期延會之說而信。則是理事會二次之召集可謂全無結果。而所謂授權白里安調處。不過敷衍此次國聨開會之　子而已此後結果。甯待再計。夫獨立國家之外交。須立於自動地位。無論外交之正式談判。或接受他國調處。本須根據正義。提出堅定不移之主張。絶不能以他國之主張爲轉移。吾國之所以服從國聨。亦惟服從國聨之能伸張正義而已假使國聨不能伸張正義。即國聨喪失其存在之價值。吾人奚能依賴。吾人除一致犧牲自起奮鬥外。又甯有他法。我國於此。更應有極堅强不屈忍死不辱之主張表示所謂堅强不屈忍死不辱之主張何即日本不先撤兵。不能進行任何交涉是也蓋日本此次出兵。侵佔我領土。毁壞我主權。全係違法行動我國旣無引起此種違法行動之原因。又始終未與一抵抗故日兵此次之行動在私法上爲殺人放火竊盜等數罪並發。祇有依法懲治在國際法上。惟有使之擔負完全責任。在此項違法事件未解决以前。其他中日問題。槪不能提及不能併其他交涉爲一談。故此時吾國民應當一致主張。非將吾國因日本出兵所受之損害先行解决。不能談及其他問題。此次國聨調處。如果合乎正義我國當然極願接受。如專順日本單方面之意旨。提出不合正義之條件。如日方最近所宣傳。則絶對不能接受。吾人自當誓死以徇正義。以保我國家民族之生存此則吾人今日所亟應堅强表示者也</p>

<p>（德記者）閣下觀察將來如何尚須時多久可告一結束</p>
<p>（袁答）余初以爲一二月内交涉即可完畢若日本必欲成立獨立新政府其時間則不敢言總之極望我當局設法將此事早日解决目下日人知無人肯組織政府而日本浪人又多到蒙邊運動獨立此實爲可慮之事日本知蔣張二公將欲對日宣戰日方早有預備並謂日本若戰勝則必拿東三省</p>
<p>（記者）闞都統朝璽有否組織政府之消息（袁答）闞亦甚關心地方成立維持會但日人對彼感情稍差乃與本維持會合併並請他當副委員長至組織政府一層現未必肯作</p>
<p>（記者）是否王孝伯（承斌）由日方請出組織政府</p>
<p>（袁答）孝伯人甚好極有才能一向住大連王之來此並無此種消息</p>
<p>（記者）是否張宗昌亦在彼方面活動</p>
<p>（袁答）張宗昌非奉天人彼在山東政聲甚劣日本人曾來此徵求余之意見余謂倘日本無害東三省之心可以無須請他出來</p>
<p>（記者）事變以來工商事業如何</p>
<p>（袁答）當然不如從前但從今日起東三省官銀號及邊業銀行已經復業與地方金融極好余曾宣言余之所以出而維持地方即欲减輕人民痛苦人之對余笑駡置之而已</p>
<p>（記者）瀋涨鐵路聞已通車確否</p>
<p>（袁答）此路已通車因爲可由北方運糧食來路局中亦有日人在日人方面要求各機關開辦内中置人監視惟市政公所之市政長爲一日人其餘辦公爲華人首領旣爲日人一切事務當由日人負責（記者）學校何日開課東北大學工廠已動工知之否又瀋海鐵路官股如何處治（袁答）開學尚談不到關於工廠動工尚不知瀋海路之官股聞由日人提取</p>
<p>（袁詢記者）在吉曾與熙長官晤談否</p>
<p>（記者答）未曾會晤只由張秘書代見</p>
<p>袁謂吉林係特殊情形與奉天不同熙氏爲輔帥代理軍民負責長官故有組織政府之事余則不然在奉天組織政府非臧主席應允不合宜倘日本人固欲請余組織政府在短期間爲大局計固無不可倘永外獨立再參加許多日本官曳豈非與高麗相同受日本之保護而爲亡國之奴隷現今是「有官無人」此次各重要機關人員均係由余敦請而來彼等初均不肯出任職務余謂作事没有何問題壛由某一人擔負與大衆無關</p>
<p>（袁問）哈埠情形如何</p>
<p>（記者答）哈爾濱與黑龍江均服從張司令長官但金融稍形紊亂耳</p>
<p>袁謂適得消息據云金融較前已好數日前本地金融亦極紊亂自今日起匯天津銀元每百只需加六元匯水若在本地使用一元當一元並無折扣在此過去二十日中余之緊要工作即募集二千名自衞警察及保安隊六百名日方巳交回少許槍枝地方秩序已漸恢復自此商業及銀行亦陸續復業法院亦將開庭日本人並未要求派官加入日本亦知司法爲獨立的</p>
<p>記者謂曾在錦縣與輔帥晤面彼時吉林情形尚好輔帥並囑吾去看他們使好好安心作事</p>
<p>袁謂輔帥也曾派人與余接洽並告余可以出面維持任憑處置但余極不願多立機關日本曾要求財政廳另辦余謂錦州有財政廳豈可再立日本人謂可以驅逐之使其解散不意後來錦州果被轟壞</p>
<p>（袁問）北寗爲何停車一日</p>

<p>朝鮮。我國之屬地也。當明之末葉。日本豐臣秀吉。稱覊國内。寇朝鮮之王京。韓人惡之。大院君當國。燒日使館。日本責之。遂出償金五十萬元。且許以兵衞使館。會朝鮮臣僚分兩黨。一以依賴中國爲主。仍守事大之義。閔泳翊，閔泳駿等爲之魁。一以依賴日本爲主。以獨立變法爲名。洪英植、金玉均等爲之魁。互相排擊。内訌不已。遂使日本坐收漁人之利。西元一千八百九十四年。（前清光緒二十年）國内東學黨作亂。日本以保護商民爲詞。遣兵入韓。韓王遣使於清廷乞師。清廷命提督葉志超、聶士成將兵至牙山。東學黨見中日兵大至。各鳥獸散。於是朝鮮之内亂問題。一變而爲中日之國際交涉矣。及日本旣敗中俄。遂以朝鮮爲保護國。協定條欵。得於其國駐屯軍隊。置軍事警察。日使伊藤博文。復迫挾韓王。令棄其外交之權。而置統監府於韓京。分建理事廳於各道。并寘警察於韓皇宫門。稽其大臣之出入。韓皇憤甚。密派李相高、李瑋鐘、李俊三人爲代表。令從美人赫爾巴達赴萬國保和會控告。萬國保和會不允提議。密使喪氣而歸。又密行哀訴於美國政府。亦被拒不得見。越數日。有用美國人之名。發電於各國大報館者。謂韓皇今見幽於日本之警察。殆同纍囚云云。於是日人洶怒。迫韓皇傳位。韓之官紳士庶。男女老幼。莫不忿慨激昂。如醉如狂。排日之運動大起。漢城西門外鐘路天洞一帶。日日集會。處處演說。於是有所謂保安會、獨立協會、興國協會、一心會等。所至號召會員。切齒裂眦。喘汗奔走。有切電綫者。有毁鐵道者。有自盡者。有秘密結社者。而卒無補於事。唯安重根哈爾濱之一擊。差强人意。而朝鮮終亡於日矣。嗚呼。今日我國之内亂頻仍。非如朝鮮之黨爭乎。暴日之寇東省。非如昔之寇韓乎。國聨會之不可恃。非如萬國保和會之不可恃乎。民憤之沸騰。非猶當日之韓人乎。暴日施其滅韓之故技。我國將蹈三韓之覆轍乎。吾述朝鮮亡國事。不暇爲朝鮮人悲矣。噫。</p>

<p>法庭上的有聲影片有聲影片雖只可供娱樂之用。但是自有聲影片的攝製發明以來。在實用上却也很有裨益。現在竟利用於法庭之上了。最近澳洲梅爾朋城。Ｍeleourne的最高法院中。有一件訟案。有人因一家牛奶房中工作的聲響過大。有擾鄰近人家的安寗。因請法庭制止　。當庭呈上有聲影片一張。即是攝取該牛奶房工作的聲響。作爲證據。法官試映之下。認爲所訴屬實。准予受理。結果獲得勝訴。英國方面。現在每有訟案發生。而與聲響有關係的。往往借助於有聲影片。即如澳洲的牛奶房一案。就很引起了英國律師們的興趣。預料以後其他各國的訟案。在必要時都將以有聲影片作證據了。</p>
<p>在幾年以前。英國有一件慘死案發生。有一個人在攝取影片時。忽遇意外而死。當時攝影器恰在工作之際。將他的死狀完全攝入。後由影片公司呈與法庭映着。得免訟累。不過那是無聲的影片罷了。</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>遠東與近東各國學者在巴黎組織成立的東方文化學會。雖然只有七年的歷史。而會員國籍已達十五國。加入的會員。都是在學術上有相當貢獻的人。並非任何人都可參加的。此會的宗旨。（一）徵集東方各國之史料。（二）考訂東方各國之古物。（三）研究東方文化之流别。（如語言·藝術·宗敎·哲學等）經各國會員七年中的努力。已具有可觀的成績了。此會以中國會員居多。第一</p>
<p>任會長又是中國會員李偉侯先生。在東方學術上政治上所負的使命。固甚重大。尤其對於我國民族與文化的前途。具特别顯著的影響。我前天參加此會的茶話會。親聆各學者的偉論。與會務進行的研討。就覺得它將來於中國學術政治上的貢獻。可斷言其不同凡響。</p>
<p>茶會席間。新由歐陸考察藝術歸來的劉海粟先生。也有長篇的演詞。他說我們在國内大家渾渾噩噩。一到了歐洲。就醒恒到我國古代學術的昌明。自己徧不會振興·闡揚。偏讓别人來吸收。探討。以現實論。我們一天天的退化。而人家是猛進不息。譬如以藝術而言。日本抬了我們一些牙慧。繪純粹的中國畫。拿到歐洲去。今天在這裏展覽。明天又到那邊去展覽。擴大宣傳。自稱爲國粹。自詡爲東方藝術的代表作品。所以除非對於東方藝術有研究的人以外。一般人只知道東方有日本的藝術。而不知有中國的藝術。</p>
<p>他說德國各邦各大學。近年對於中國古代學術。十分重視。比我們看重西洋學術的熱度。不知高了多少倍。各大學都設立中國學院。專門研究中國歷代文化。中國的哲學·文學·藝學以及各種經典。搜集得非常完備。即如老子·莊子·墨子·列子·孔孟學說······。都有完善的譯本。可見其研究精神的一斑。各大學很歡迎中國學者去演講。可是中國學者實地去考察。去講學的人。簡直是鳳毛麟角。今年三月中旬。劉氏到了佛蘭克府大學。那中國學院院長。就請他演講三天。第一個講題是。「中國繪畫上之六法論」。講到「氣韻生動」四個字。曾作以下一段的解釋。傲。不復苦沈寂。予隻身覊旅。觸景懐人。斜倚車廂。默誦姜白石南去北來何事。蕩湘雲楚水。極目傷心之句。未免感慨繫之。幸路程非遥。十一時抵琶江口站。下車行里許。抵江畔。雷段長預雇汽船相候領導。衆集揚帆。衝波前進。計程先赴藏霞洞。雲梯石棧。繞曲而上。澗水清澈。淙淙成聲。觀中廣植花卉。紅紫清芬。山後有頑石一方。上書璽字。據云爲乾隆所遺石璽。以訛傳訛。可哂也。折而西。往飛霞洞。琳宫紺宇。備極宏偉。雙峯對峙。形成獅象。雄壯奇觀。洞後築有鳳凰樓。黄昏斜陽。黎明朝日。憑欄遠眺。景色絶勝。是間主事招待殷勤。出素餐以饗客。蔬菜可口。味美於回。入夕。留宿小閣。風濤之聲。隱約入耳。一枕黄粱。飄然欲仙。翌日。黎明即起。倚欄觀日。朝雲未散。曉陽乍升。霞光萬道。五色繽紛。令人不可逼視。退而進早餐畢。謝辭下山。拾級曼步。猶有餘戀焉。仍駕舟赴飛來寺。寺原名廣慶。在清遠上流禺峽。衆山環拱。江流清幽。波光帆影。如入天然畫圖。縱目四觀。滌塵萬斛。寺後有飛泉白練下埀。激石微響。旁築一飛泉亭。俯仰聽瀑。不忍遽去。名人如李印泉陳樹人潘文治輩。呼朋常集。流連忘返。固知非負虛名。别有引人入勝者在也。山巔尚有帝子祠。及讀書岩。歸猿洞。喜雨亭。金鎖潭諸勝。惜以時間所覊。未克暢游。姑留之以待他日。</p>

<p>其他互有漲跌上落均甚微</p>
<p>昨日各公債市况、現貨上午毫無交易、但後市則多有做開期貨大致尚佳其十一月份期貨交易已見漸形活潑、蓋爲交易所方面對於套利賣方交易、不收證金、所以奬勵套利買賣、套利進出、因頗多也、至言各債價之變動、以外交形勢混沌如前、國聨雖有令日先行撤兵之决議而日仍行緩拒、反對第三者干涉、前途能否另有技節、尚難逆測、幸國内和平統一、實現期近、市場人心大致尚屬安定、各債價在晨初開出時、比前日多曾一度稍漲、以後賣方較爲活潑、各價遂均漸漸趨疲、但統稅鹽稅關稅等、前後市上落甚微、結果較前日以二○關本下月期及一九善十月跌一元八九角爲較鉅、一九關开二○捲等亦約小一元其他均無大變動、較前日仍見互有漲跌、如編遣裁兵等下月期貨、各漲起頗巨、觀證券市之形勢、雖大致尚佳、而察其趨勢、則依然甚難捉摸、將仍外交情况之推移而定也、計現貨交易共二萬三千元、期貨上午六百六十餘萬、後市約二百六十萬、合計九百二十萬零五千元、内以統稅佔二百數十萬爲較多二零關鹽稅亦尚佳、又各債劵十一月期貨交易合九十餘萬元、價别期現前開後收較上日成交數</p>

<p>今年夏季之末一月。七月份之美國汽車出産。計其數目爲二二一四八五輛。八月份中因福特出産加以限止。故其産額亦不若預料之多。其數量大槪在一五五○○○輛左右。夏季汽車事業之不景氣。至此殆將告一斷落矣。福特於月底之前宣稱其造車數目爲五○○○○輛。通用汽車公司之産預計七八○○○輛。其中六○○○○輛將爲雪佛蘭汽車。克雷斯勒公司之七月份出産爲二五○○○輛。如八月份中順風牌欵新車之産及銷售不及三七○○○輛。則其失望之可斷言也克雷斯勒公司别部份之産量約爲五○○○○輛。除福特産額不計外。加入其他各車廠之出産。八月份之全部汽車産量當在一五五○○○輛左右。</p>
<p>每屆夏季之末。美國汽車事業常有銷沉之象。此係歷年常態。無足稱怪。故七八兩月之汽車出産。雖爲數如是之低落。而各廠方對於秋後氣象。尚頗樂觀。良以秋季爲汽車營業轉機時期。各製造廠都於此時努力銷售。以推廣其業務之進展也。照本年之狀况預測低價汽車之銷路。當於秋季中更佔優勢。凡製造低價汽車之廠商。如福特雪佛蘭等。均一致振起。以救其出品之暢銷。故九月份之美國汽車出産。在大體上言。必能超過七八兩月。而今年最後一季之造車成績。亦必爲其他三季之冠。</p>
<p>新陳代謝。爲汽車營業中之唯一要素。每一種新車出世。必用種種方法以求銷售。而其代替舊車之地位。更爲重要。但若市面疲乏。銷路不旺。則新車之命運亦必大受打擊。今年夏季美洲市塲之新出汽車即大受此種影響。故已往之數月中。新車銷路。遠不及目下之情狀也。邇者各種營業均有活潑之轉機。一特新車登塲。其前程亦頗有望耳。</p>
<p>尚有一事。足爲目下汽車銷路之阻滯者。即各廠將有新模型問世是也。買主方面常因廠方初秋冬之交。以新車行世。於是意欲購買者。亦必待新車登塲。始决其購買之計劃。職是之故。每年到此時期。不啻青黄不接。舊車業已銷路疲乏。而新車則尚未登場。於是暫時告一進等。産銷皆趨於沉寂一途。至於廠方對於此事更爲重視。除需要之殷求外。不令出産過多。而有滯呆之象。但以其餘力從事於新車之製造。以便至新車問世時。得以大舉發展。</p>
<p>明年應時之新車。刻下各廠已在中工趕造。關於革新及改良方面。進步甚多。且有最新之計劃。爲向來汽車界所未見者。亦將於一九三二年式之汽車中與世人相見。此種新車大致目下不能發售。必待冬初始能出廠。若論低價汽車。則明年各廠之競爭。尤爲可觀。目下製造低價車之各廠。已在殫心竭力。日夜計劃。欲以最經濟之法。製造其新車。俾買主方面能用最低廉之價格。得到最實用之代步品。</p>
<p>關於新車之推行。各廠家亦已想盡種種方法。以求急切之銷售。故美洲市塲上新車亦已漸次出現。但其種類不甚完備。而買主方面亦多觀望不前。測其用意。無非欲等各種新車出齊。始下選擇之决心。有數廠家急切推銷其新模型起見。已將其新車之特色廣爲宣傳。並用舊車折價低付貨欵辦法。引誘顧主。但其結果初不若預料之美滿。因買主方面必至冬初始有易置新車之意想。而最大之原因。必須待明春紐約汽車展覽會舉行後。始决定其買購之方針也。</p>
<p>九月份之美國汽車銷售數。現雖尚無精確之統計。然據專家推測。大約在一八○·○○○輛左右。以較八月似有起色。然亦低微不足道也。自九月至十二月。其中十·十一·及十二三個月。産銷成績必較前數季爲佳。因時屆年終。買主爲明春計。多於此時添置新車。而各廠家之新模型。亦將於此二三個月中續漸上市也。</p>
<p>除客車外。運貨汽車之銷售近來頗有轉機。廠方産銷兩途均有起色。故專造運貨汽車之各廠家對於前途亦頗樂觀。而運貨汽車之銷售暢旺。常爲客車暢銷之先兆。八月份中出産及銷售均有紀錄可徵。前途光明。似非虛語也。</p>

<p>— 錦</p>
<p>每逢上到無興味的功課的時候、總有許多同學講話的講話、胡閙的胡閙、簡直不是靜靜的、尤其是上生理課、那位新進來的生理先生對於學生是十二分的客氣、不十分嚴厲不　實在是無可奈何吧、因爲若先生說了「喂、請靜些、」那可就有許多不客氣的說話進貢了、直弄得先生没口分辯、所以每逢上到這生理課不是何講話、便是他胡閙、靜聽的人極少、就是那些類乎靜聽的人中却還佔了、半拿小說書代替的、</p>
<p>其中有位毛女士、對於生理先生更厭惡、她上課的時候、總是拿小說書代替的、她把小說書放在抽屜裏拿抽屜拉開着、身子向後靠在牆上、二只眼睛釘在小說書上、桌上放着一本生理書、這樣一來、她便穩穩當當地看了、若先生走了過來、他但連忙把抽屜關上、同時還咳一咳嗽、好似預備開講似的</p>
<p>這一天她的小說書被一個同房間的朋友借去了、恰巧又遇着對他無興味的生理課、她便尋出幾個難　　先生了這些問題却都是書外的、後來她突然說、一「先生、你講的怎麽、怎麽我們一些也聽不懂、」</p>
<p>「那麽我再講一遍就是了、」先生慢吞吞地說着、</p>
<p>「不先生你不應照你的土語講、這樣不清不楚眞的要命了、先生你講國語吧、」</p>
<p>「是的、國語、但我講國語也是這個樣子呢、」</p>
<p>「那麽、我們不懂怎樣呢、」</p>
<p>「············」</p>
<p>其實他講的話雖不是純粹的國語、但靜靜地聽是很明白的、那位毛女士並非是絶對聽不懂、不過不知怎樣她總是見這先生極恨的、</p>
<p>噹噹的下課鐘響了、先生匆匆地走出去了、好似跑出了地獄般的、那位毛女士等先生走了以後、她便大聲地說道、「這種先生也配敎我們嗎、我們大家去告訴敎務長邑、横豎敎務長對於我級是很好的、」</p>
<p>「恐怕没有這樣容易邑、」一位莊女士忙站起來說、</p>

<h3 id="c193">一、原因 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>（一）三寳壟荷文商業公報、關於北加浪岸排華惡潮事、有一段紀載、據稱北加浪岸府之報告、尚未詳盡說、是在數月前龜突回敎堂前發生過華巫人鬥毆案、此次北加浪岸惡潮與龜突鬥毆案、均帶有宗敎性之排華思想、加之北加岸荷官克拉瑪博士之設立土人中等社、釀成排華運動該荷官本人亦無法挽此狂瀾、其實在去年十月或十一月間、地方長官如果去勸、告土人中等社、不得用不合法手段與華商起營業競爭、尚能防患於未然、此次惡潮全由放重利之各哈夷恐怖政策所激成、在先散播含有宗敎意味之排華色彩、而克拉瑪博士復慫恿於後致排華潮横决而無法使之納諸正軌也、</p>
<p>（二）巴達維亞電訊稱、荷屬爪哇之北加浪岸（州、）（Ｐekalongan）爲爪哇北海岸之一安靜小鎭、許久以前、因華僑商民、與土人間之經濟競爭發生、因此已成爲不安靜之地方、許多中國商店、已宣告停業、至今間已復開、然生意極爲蕭索、仍無時無刻、不凖備關門每日下午五時以後、華人商店、仍開門營業者、誠如鳳毛麟角、因此之故、零賣業大受影響、而簡直給與歐洲入口批發商、以極大之損失、至於此種經濟仇對狀况之産生乃因士人方面、欲建立零信售業、以與華人商店競爭及後此等商店、果如雨後春筍般、不斷地開張、北加浪岸、及附近各處、俱有此種商店之設立、且處處表現其組織健全、管理得法之精神、誠給與華僑小商人、莫大之打擊、此種士人之商店、其顧客多爲士人、（爪哇人）彼等義氣干雲、明知華人商店之貨物較爲價廉亦不肯購買、華人商店受此營業上之損失、誠不堪設想、於是有無力清還歐人入口批發商之債務者、有脅迫歐人、謂此後不得再將貨物批發與士人商店、者當地政府、業已極力設法救濟、此種經濟衝突之現象、然亦無效、而華人當局、則極少能給與彼等以助力者、</p>
<p>由此觀之、我們曉得北加浪的排華的原因、含有宗敎的歧視、與經濟的競爭的意義、其實還隱民族的鬭爭、與帝國主義者的挑撥的背景、</p>
<p>二、事實</p>

<p>三寳壟中國領事及副領事、曾至北加浪岸地方觀察該地人民、乃請求領事、速致電中國政府、即派戰艦一艘、前來以警醒荷屬政府、而拯救北加浪岸之僑民、於經濟恐慌中、</p>
<p>且在華爪人民間之經濟競爭中、不特發生華人貨物受士人抵制後且二者時常發生衝突、以現感情更爲破裂、而使現象越趨險惡、</p>

<h3 id="e1">League of Nations Administrative Council Announces Indefinite Postponement of Meeting <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Briand and China, Japan Exchange Views Hoping to Find a Solution</p>
<p>(Geneva) The discussion of the Manchurian problem by the League of Nations Council has undergone a drastic change. Tonight, the council suddenly issued a notice stating that due to a lack of accurate information and the need to await new developments, the council has decided to postpone the discussion of the problem indefinitely. The notice also stated that French Foreign Minister Briand, in his capacity as acting chairman, will continue to work hard on mediation and report to the council at any time. (National News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Briand is making every effort to mediate between the two parties involved in the Manchurian issue. Today, he met with the representatives of China and Japan. His talks with Japanese representative Yoshizawa mainly involved an exchange of views. What was discussed will probably not be known until the administrative council meeting. Briand must report to the administrative council on his efforts to bring the two sides closer. Regardless of what suggestions are put forward by the administrative council or any relevant party, it is currently impossible to talk about a fixed plan to solve the difficult problem. In short, various suggestions aimed at a solution must have sufficient flexibility in order to have a chance of gaining general agreement. Until the negotiations reach a more concrete stage, the basis for a possible agreement will naturally not be announced, so as not to hinder its success. It is heard that the various suggestions planned by the administrative council are being considered in Tokyo. Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji met with Briand for forty minutes. After the meeting, Shi told people that there had been no discussion of concrete proposals and that the talks were limited to an exchange of views. The general impression at present seems to be that not much progress has been made in finding a practical solution, but it is heard that Briand is still continuing his efforts to facilitate direct negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese governments. According to reliable sources, the measures proposed by the administrative council to China and Japan are still no different from those proposed in September. Whether the ship [should carry out] expansion depends on Tokyo and Nanjing. However, the administrative council is unwilling to insist on an immutable approach. If the two sides can find a basis for a solution, the administrative council will definitely be happy to accept it, without a doubt. Today, private talks on the Manchurian issue were not limited to discussions between Briand and the Chinese and foreign representatives. After meeting with Briand, Chinese representative Dr. Shi also went to see British Foreign Secretary Reading, and Reading later received American Deputy Envoy Gilbert. The Chinese and Japanese representatives both telegraphed their governments regarding the outcome of their talks with Briand. The League of Nations Administrative Council may not meet until a reply is received. According to reliable sources, the representatives of France, Italy, Germany, and the United States have asked the Chinese and Japanese governments to pay attention to their obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Representatives of other countries attending the administrative council will also take similar action. Instructions from their governments are still awaited. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Briand received the representatives of China and Japan. The replies from China and Japan regarding Yoshizawa's request that he specify a date for the withdrawal of troops and Shi Zhaoji's request that he inform the National Government of the measures taken to respect treaties and protect Japanese residents are expected to arrive approximately tomorrow. The representatives of China and Japan here will continue to report the views of the President of the Executive Yuan to their respective countries and ask their governments to prevent the occurrence of new incidents, so as not to make the dispute worse. The situation this afternoon was roughly like this. The conditions put forward by Japan are still kept secret. According to our agency's knowledge, Yoshizawa has abandoned purely political demands, but seems to demand that the agreement signed in May 1915 regarding commercial land leases and the right of mixed residence be expanded and implemented throughout Manchuria. In addition, treaties not recognized by the Kuomintang are also required to be respected. The Chinese delegation stated that this kind of request should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Washington Conference on the registration of treaties, but whether this provision has retroactive effect remains to be studied. The situation tonight is generally better, because the discussion of the Manchurian problem after the participation of the United States is as important as the dispute itself. Previously, the League of Nations only prevented war in a certain place, and this seems to have been accomplished. At this moment, with the participation of a third party with vested interests, it is not appropriate to act arbitrarily. Japan is still seriously resisting the participation of the United States. It cannot be concluded that Yoshizawa told our agency's reporter that he would remain reserved until he received instructions from Foreign Minister Shidehara. This change cannot be ignored. If the Japanese representative uses waiting for instructions as an excuse and is unwilling to attend open meetings, the arrival of unexpected events is still worrying. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This evening, it is generally believed here that the Manchurian case has made great progress after Briand's day-long contact with the two chief representatives of China and Japan, but it still requires huge concessions to resolve. Because China is still refusing direct negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese governments, and Japan is still unwilling to stipulate a deadline for the withdrawal of troops, but apart from these two points, the attitudes of both sides have eased compared to before. The council now hopes that after Briand contacts both sides, he will be able to agree on a method to ensure that Japan withdraws its troops quickly, while China increases its protection of Japanese residents. Because the withdrawal of troops and the protection of Japanese residents can be resolved, the rest will be solved easily. Therefore, there is sufficient optimism here tonight that the council will be able to hold an open meeting to end its month-long work. When Briand met with Shi Zhaoji at six o'clock this evening, a spokesperson for the Chinese delegation issued a statement refuting the absurdity of the chaotic situation in Manchuria mentioned in Yoshizawa's note to the council, saying that the Japanese army's forcible stationing on Chinese territory is the most likely element to cause resentment and disputes in Manchuria. The Chinese army has been able to endure deeply and avoid provoking incidents after seeing its territory forcibly occupied by the Japanese army for a month, which shows the discipline and obedience of the Chinese army. Since China can maintain law and order in areas outside Manchuria, it can naturally maintain law and order in Manchuria, but this guarantee must be based on the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the South Manchurian Railway concession. The reason is very clear. (National News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Briand and Yoshizawa, as well as League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, were originally scheduled to meet at noon today. Yoshizawa was supposed to inform them of Japan's five demands and the country's views on Briand's proposals. When the time came, Yoshizawa said that because instructions from Tokyo had not arrived, he requested a postponement. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The activities of the administrative council are now temporarily suspended, pending replies from China and Japan to the experimental plan proposed by the administrative council to resolve the Manchurian problem. It is unlikely that a meeting will be held today, but if a reply is received in the evening, a meeting may still be held tonight. Today, Briand continued to talk with Yoshizawa and Shi Zhaoji, because the plan proposed by the administrative council is still in its embryonic stage. At present, China and Japan are still sending urgent official documents to the League of Nations Secretariat, reporting on the military situation in Manchuria. The Chinese delegation received a telegram from Nanjing containing Zhang Xueliang's report and the facts from October 16 to 19, stating that Japanese aircraft are still dropping bombs everywhere. The Japanese consul in Shenyang denied the claim that Japanese aircraft bombed Tongliao, killing fourteen people, saying that the attackers of Tongliao were Mongols. It also said that the six aircraft that appeared in the sky over Tongliao on October 14 must have been civilian aircraft ordered to rescue twenty-eight employees of Okura &amp; Co.'s Jutian, fearing that they would be harmed by the Chinese. The Japanese consul in Zhengjiatun reported the situation of the Mongol attack, and also said that the Japanese military authorities had sent eighty soldiers by armored train to rescue the Koreans there and inspect the railway line from Zhengjiatun to Tongliao (which was built with Japanese capital). Unexpectedly, the train derailed and was bombarded by Chinese soldiers. Therefore, the Japanese military authorities sent another 150 rifle soldiers to rescue them. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Conditions for Japanese Troop Withdrawal <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Five Basic Points in Total, Its Ambition is Clearly Visible</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Before withdrawing troops from areas outside the railway zone, Japan must have China recognize in principle five basic points, which have been sent to Briand, the Chairman of the League of Nations Administrative Council, Drummond, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, and Stimson, the US Secretary of State. According to sources, the five points are as follows: (1) China and Japan mutually guarantee not to invade each other and to protect each other's territorial integrity; (2) All forms of anti-Japanese sentiment within China, including boycotts, must be permanently abolished; (3) Ensure the safety of the lives and property of Japanese people within China; (4) Repay the Japanese funds used to build the Manchurian railways and recognize the existing treaties for building the Manchurian railways; (5) Recognize existing treaty rights, including the issue of Japanese leased land in Manchuria. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is heard that Briand, the Chairman of the League of Nations Administrative Council, has expressed his belief that he can persuade China to accept four of the five basic points put forward by Japan without much difficulty. However, he advised Japan to abandon the point that China must recognize Japanese railway rights as a prerequisite for starting negotiations. Judging from the news from reliable sources here tonight, Briand seems to believe that China can eventually accept this request, but it is particularly difficult to make China accept this point in principle. If Japan insists on accepting this principle before negotiations begin, then negotiations will not be able to start for a while. Tonight, Japanese officials are showing greater optimism, and they all believe that the difficult point of the entire problem is now focused on Japan's demand that China first recognize its treaty rights in Manchuria, including the treaty rights obtained from the Twenty-One Demands and the 1915 treaty. According to Nanjing, this treaty was signed under duress, so it has never recognized this right. However, the Japanese said that if the reasons held by Nanjing are correct, then many treaties, including the Treaty of Versailles, which gave birth to the League of Nations, will also be considered invalid. The Japanese refuted this and wanted China to recognize all treaty rights before the meeting, at least in principle. The Japanese believe that the development of the Manchurian situation this time is due to China's failure to recognize the rights that Japan believes it should have according to the treaty.

<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador Debuchi informed US Secretary of State Stimson today that Japan no longer opposes the attendance of US representatives at the Council meeting. He also said that the Japanese army has transferred combat aircraft from Manchuria back to Korea, and a small team of the army has also been withdrawn. The situation in Manchuria has made great progress. Order in Shenyang has been restored, banks have opened, and radio stations will be able to report soon. Most of the railways within Manchuria have resumed normal traffic, and he assured Stimson that there would be no more incidents of Japanese military aircraft dropping bombs on Chinese cities and towns. Therefore, officials here today are gradually becoming more optimistic that a war in the Far East can be avoided. (National News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government will unite with the League of Nations Administrative Council to invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact in order to stop the war between China and Japan caused by the Manchurian Incident, but it is heard that the United States is acting cautiously and does not want to take the lead in this matter.

<p>(Geneva) The US representative attending the League of Nations Council has not uttered a word, and has been listening throughout, reporting the situation of the meeting to his home government. (Japan-League News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is said that Washington has reported that Japan has withdrawn its opposition to the United States' participation in the League of Nations Administrative Council's discussion of the Manchurian problem. The Japanese side here believes that this is slightly wrong, because it believes that Japan does not oppose Gilbert's participation in the administrative council's discussion, but does not want the administrative council to ignore the constitutional issues arising from this. Japan has stated in its note to the administrative council on Sunday that Japan cannot regard the attendance of the US representative as a procedural issue. Japan reserves this matter for future discussion. [end of sentence cut off]</p>

<p>The Japanese delegation has not yet received a reply from Tokyo regarding Briand's proposal on behalf of the administrative council for a solution. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) People in the League of Nations have long known that Japan's opposition to the United States' attendance is not for political reasons, but because (1) it believes that it violates the charter, (2) the Council's decision was too hasty, and (3) it fears that the League of Nations will use the backing of the United States to strongly interfere in the Sino-Japanese dispute. Now that the US representative has attended, it has been shown that Japan's fears are unfounded, and Japan's right to demand a decision on the legality of US attendance in the future remains intact, so the Japanese no longer oppose it. At the same time, Japan also officially notified the League of Nations that the Japanese army in Manchuria is gradually withdrawing to the South Manchurian Railway concession. Therefore, the Council has decided to continue holding only secret meetings and informal contacts for the time being, and not to convene open meetings, so as to avoid the appearance of using public pressure, which would have a negative impact on the feelings of both sides. It is likely that there will be no more open meetings in the future until a solution is found. (National News dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Today, French Foreign Minister Briand and British Foreign Secretary Reading both advised Japanese representative Yoshizawa to agree on a period for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the South Manchurian Railway concession. Yoshizawa replied that the timing of the troop withdrawal depends entirely on the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents given by China. Briand then inquired about the conditions for security desired by the Japanese side. Yoshizawa replied that everything was as stated in the previous note: (1) To ease the intense feelings of the people of China and Japan in an appropriate way, (2) The Chinese army should stop harassing the Japanese army, (3) China should respect Japan's vested treaty rights in Manchuria. According to reports, Briand and Yoshizawa met at 11:00 this morning. At the same time, British representative Cadogan, on behalf of British Foreign Secretary Reading, visited League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond. At 11:30, Briand and Reading met. Yoshizawa reported to the Council that (1) the Chinese claim that Japan is supplying the Mongols with guns and bullets from the Shenyang Arsenal has been investigated and found to be untrue; (2) when the Chinese army was at war with the Mongols, the six Japanese aircraft dropped bombs on the Chinese soldiers were actually ordinary aircraft sent to rescue twenty-eight Japanese farm employees from danger. All Japanese employees in Tongliao have now been evacuated. The train is closed due to banditry; (3) After 1,500 Mongols fought with the Chinese soldiers, the Japanese armored train was sent to rescue the Koreans from danger. However, the Chinese soldiers attacked the armored train, causing it to derail and open fire on the people in the train. (National News dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Dr. Shi Zhaoji, the chief Chinese representative, today gave the American Associated Press a statement on the latest developments in the Manchurian case. In the statement, Shi solemnly stated China's desire to maintain peace in East Asia, saying that China is willing to accept any solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute that the whole world considers fair and reasonable. China fully trusts the League of Nations and fully believes that the actions of the Council will be fair and equal, so it will absolutely abide by the resolutions of the Council. China hopes that the Japanese army will withdraw from the places where it should not be stationed as soon as possible, and believes that after giving Japan considerable respect for its position in Manchuria, China's proposals regarding the negotiation procedure can be resolved within the possible scope. Shi also solemnly reaffirmed the claim that complete troop withdrawal is a prerequisite, saying that the Chinese government has repeatedly promised to properly protect the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in the territory, but it believes that Japan's demand for direct diplomatic negotiations is clearly not in China's interest.

<p>Regarding Obligations Under the Kellogg-Briand Pact</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan has received notes from various countries asking it to pay attention to its obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and is now drafting a reply. It is heard that the general idea is still that the actions of the Japanese army outside Shenyang on the night of September 18 were purely for self-defense, and subsequent actions were a natural and related move based on this factual basis. The reply will mention the Chinese anti-Japanese movement, saying that the anti-Japanese economic boycott within China cannot be said to be a peaceful method. The Kellogg-Briand Pact requires signatory countries not to resolve international negotiations by non-peaceful methods, so the Chinese anti-Japanese movement violates China's obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact.

<h3 id="e14">Our Nation Today Has Reached Its Final Moment of Crisis <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The People of Our Nation Should Have an Extremely Strong Declaration</p>
<p>The League of Nations, in view of the perilous situation of the Sino-Japanese problem, fearing that the outbreak of war would damage the League of Nations' dignity and image, has had to vigorously court the United States, hoping to use the combined power of Europe and the United States to save the Sino-Japanese situation from imminent danger. However, the result was only to advise both parties with the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Japan remained strong and unyielding. After the League of Nations was caught in this dilemma, it authorized Briand to negotiate with China and Japan, but still failed to find a solution. Now, there is news of an indefinite postponement of the meeting due to drastic changes in the situation. The League of Nations' situation is like this, and our nation is becoming more and more dangerous.</p>
<p>The League of Nations' efforts this time are entirely aimed at maintaining the breakdown of world peace, and it is not concerned with who is wronged or who is forcibly occupied between China and Japan. Since the second convocation of the Council, the intentions of the participating countries have all been shifted by Japan's unilateral intentions. They have not mentioned Japan's violation of the previous Council's resolution on the withdrawal of troops, nor the various acts of violence such as the bombing of Jinzhou. It is said that all are afraid that Japan's attitude is too tough and cannot be subdued. This time, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which does not emphasize right and wrong but only peace, was used to advise both parties. The Japanese even argued strongly, claiming that it was not related to the pact, and resolutely refused to withdraw troops. It can be imagined what their barbaric and unreasonable attitude is. The League of Nations dares not use the effective sanctions methods of its charter, nor does it use the Nine-Power Treaty to deal with this matter, but only hopes to find a solution through negotiation and mediation. In this situation, the Japanese, on the one hand, used their usual preparations, continuously issuing fabricated statements, and on the other hand, used their intimidation tactics to pressure the League of Nations. Our country has been silent. Under this situation, it is difficult to guarantee that the League of Nations will not be intimidated by Japan, and that there will be proposals unfavorable to us, so that our full of righteous indignation will be wiped out and there will be no way to appeal. Today, the power of the League of Nations is insufficient to suppress strong countries, but more than enough to oppress weak countries. Therefore, our country, at this extremely dangerous moment, should also have an extremely strong, unyielding, and unhumiliating proposition to express. If today's rumor of indefinite postponement is true, then the second convocation of the Council can be said to have achieved nothing, and the so-called authorization of Briand to mediate is just a formality for this League of Nations meeting. The subsequent results will have to be considered later. The diplomacy of an independent country must be based on an autonomous position. Whether it is formal diplomatic negotiations or accepting mediation from other countries, it must be based on justice and put forward a firm and unswerving proposition. It must never be shifted by the propositions of other countries. Our country's obedience to the League of Nations is only because the League of Nations can uphold justice. If the League of Nations cannot uphold justice, then the League of Nations loses its value of existence. How can we rely on it? We have no other way but to unite and sacrifice ourselves to fight. Our country should also have an extremely strong, unyielding, and unhumiliating proposition to express. What is the so-called strong, unyielding, and unhumiliating proposition? That is, no negotiations can be conducted until Japan withdraws its troops first. This time, Japan sent troops to invade our territory and destroy our sovereignty, all of which are illegal actions. Our country has no reason to cause such illegal actions, and has never resisted. Therefore, the actions of the Japanese soldiers this time are multiple crimes such as murder, arson, and theft in private law, and can only be punished according to law. In international law, they must bear full responsibility. Before this illegal incident is resolved, other Sino-Japanese problems cannot be mentioned at all, and cannot be discussed together with other negotiations. Therefore, at this time, our people should unanimously advocate that no other issues can be discussed until the damage suffered by our country due to the dispatch of Japanese troops is resolved first. If the League of Nations' mediation this time is in line with justice, our country will of course be very willing to accept it. If it is solely in accordance with Japan's unilateral intentions and puts forward conditions that are not in line with justice, as Japan has recently publicized, then it must never be accepted. We should swear to uphold justice with our lives to protect the survival of our country and nation. This is what we should strongly declare today.</p>

<p>Our Side Cables Geneva to Refute</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles: Our side cabled Geneva on the 19th to refute the Japanese side's excuse that bandits and deserters bombed Jinzhou and other places. It stated that Japanese planes conducted reconnaissance and bombing for no reason, and instead used the excuse that the Chinese authorities could not control bandits and deserters, which was completely unreasonable. It was found that before September 18, all the places pointed out by the Japanese side were extremely peaceful and there were no bandits. This is a matter of fact. Now, the Japanese side says that there are bandits in certain places, that is, there are several places that are true, all of which are within the Japanese occupation or its military scope. From this, one, the bandits were created by Japan; two, our side's power does not reach and cannot be eliminated. Based on these two facts, the bandits in the above-mentioned places should be the responsibility of the Japanese side. As for the deserters mentioned by the Japanese side, the Chinese troops originally in various places occupied by the Japanese army were gradually forced to withdraw from various places occupied by the Japanese army to avoid conflict. Such as the troops pointed out by the Japanese army in Dagushan Goubangzi, Jin County, Yizhou Zhangwu, and Hailong, are all non-deserters stationed in various places to guard the border. In addition, the Japanese side's bombing was all in the city edges and places with shops and residents, and residents were bombed. The Japanese side's claim that it did not bomb cities and civilians is even more untrue. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>

The newspaper also reported that Prime Minister Laval was very concerned about the Sino-Japanese incident on the French island ship, and communicated with the Foreign Minister by radio from time to time to learn about new changes between China and Japan, and how the League of Nations should deal with it.

<p>(Nanjing) At 2:00 p.m. on the 20th, Chiang received representatives from Britain, the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and other countries attending the current Pacific International Affairs Conference in the auditorium of the National Government. During the meeting, Chiang stood up and gave a speech, saying that in the most scientifically developed 20th century, the speed of civilization's progress is incomparable to that of 20 years ago. Only by promoting world peace can the evolution of civilization be achieved. All countries in the world should seek happiness for mankind with a spirit of impartiality. At present, there are fewer people who disregard world peace and only aim at selfishness than there were 20 years ago, but it cannot be said that there are none. Today, all of you representatives have come to China to hold a meeting, and I would like to express my welcome. I hope that you will find a way to study how to unite world public opinion and eliminate the center of gravity of those who are generally selfish during the meeting. The peace of the world really depends on it. Among the representatives, the American representative, Kimura, gave a reply, saying that what Chairman Chiang mentioned earlier coincides with the purpose of the Pacific International Affairs Conference. We are even more eager to seek full understanding between countries and promote world peace, which must first be started by individuals from various countries. After all, communication between countries is not as convenient as the exchange of opinions between individuals. There is a saying in Chinese books, "Those who want to govern their country must first regulate their family; those who want to regulate their family must first cultivate themselves." How apt these words are. We are promoting understanding between countries through personal exchanges, and we are also based on this intention. We must first promote understanding between people, and then take a step further to seek understanding between countries. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>

In ancient times, China explained China's hopes for the world, with the words "cars on the same track, books with the same text, and lines with the same ethics." Therefore, at this time, all countries in the world should move towards peace, because peace means harmony. Therefore, at this time, the cultures of all countries must be harmonized before peace can be achieved. The Pacific International Institute is nothing more than the harmonization of the cultural meanings of various countries, and it has mutual development with the ancient Chinese "cars on the same track, books with the same text, and lines with the same ethics." I hope that all representatives will do their best for public reason and justice in the future, and they will definitely achieve our ultimate goal of world harmony. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>There is No Truth to the Claim of Japanese Troops Withdrawing from Jilin</p>
<p>The Japanese Representative's Statement at the League of Nations is Entirely False</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: A certain important foreigner, concerned about the Northeast issue, personally went to various places in Liaoning and Jilin to inspect the truth. He was especially thorough in Jilin. Upon returning, he prepared a report, making an impartial record. The original text has already been sent overseas for publication. We have specially obtained a copy and translated it as follows:</p>
<p>"On the morning of September 19, the Japanese Second Battalion suddenly attacked the road police headquarters at the Erdaogou Station of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Chinese military camp at Nanling in Changchun. After a massacre in which 1,500 soldiers were killed, they occupied these two locations. Xi Qia, the acting chairman of Jilin Province and deputy commander of the Jilin Border Defense, upon receiving a report from Changchun, ordered the local Chinese military authorities not to retaliate against the Japanese army and sent two people to Changchun to investigate the incident. After the Jilin Provincial Government learned that Shenyang had also been attacked and occupied by the Japanese army on the night of the 18th, it convened a committee meeting to decide on a response. The committee ordered Shi Luben, the Jilin Foreign Affairs Director, to go to the Japanese consulate to inquire about the situation in Shenyang and Changchun. The Japanese consul immediately met with Xi Qia, the acting chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government, who inquired about the truth of the incident and the reasons for the Japanese army's attack. The Japanese consul replied that these were all military actions and beyond his knowledge. Before taking his leave, Xi Qia stated that, while the truth was unclear, the Chinese government would be responsible for protecting the lives and property of Japanese people in Jilin, and he hoped the Japanese consul would notify the Japanese authorities in Changchun not to send troops to Jilin City. The Japanese consul agreed to do so. On the 20th, in order to prevent the Chinese army from retaliating against the Japanese army due to the Changchun and Shenyang incidents, Xi Qia ordered the 25th Brigade and the 682nd Regiment of the Jilin Army, as well as the 11th Engineering Battalion, to move to the suburbs of Jilin. He sent Shi Luben to the Japanese consulate to inform the Japanese side of this matter, guaranteeing to the Japanese consul that the Chinese military police would fully protect the lives and property of Japanese people. On the same day, a telegram was received from the Jilin Japanese consul stating that the Japanese army in Changchun was prepared to go to Jilin on the 21st. Xi Qia then ordered the Chinese army to move further from its station. The purpose of the Chinese government's actions was, first, to avoid military conflict, and second, to comply with the Pact of Paris. On the 21st, two Japanese aircraft flew to Jilin for reconnaissance, dropping a large number of Japanese paper flags and various Chinese leaflets. The leaflets stated that the Chinese army in Shenyang had sabotaged the South Manchurian Railway at 10:30 p.m. on the 18th, killing and injuring several Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army had no choice but to use force to protect its vested rights in Manchuria. However, the truth is not so. According to official Chinese reports from Shenyang and those who witnessed the situation firsthand: (1) Shenyang was extremely quiet until 11 p.m., when the sound of gunfire was first heard. (2) At 11:15 p.m., the sound of an explosion was heard. The cause of the disturbance was that the Japanese themselves had sabotaged the Liuhe railway bridge on the South Manchurian Railway from Changchun to Shenyang. Therefore, the Japanese artillery stationed at the South Manchurian Railway Station bombarded the Beidaying barracks as their target. From this, we can know that the sabotage of the railway occurred simultaneously with or shortly after the Japanese army opened fire, and the Japanese used this as a pretext for military occupation of Manchuria. Judging from the Japanese security system on the South Manchurian Railway, no Chinese army could reach the railway area. How could they prepare to sabotage the railway without the Japanese knowing until the sabotage was successful? In fact, this matter is very simple, and for no reason, everyone knows the truth of this matter. On the same day, the Japanese army of the South Manchurian Railway dispatched three trains from Changchun to Jilin. Japanese and South Manchurian Railway personnel were stationed at each station to manage the railway. By dusk of that day, the entire route from Jilin to Changchun was under Japanese control, and all Chinese railway guards were disarmed. At 6:30 p.m., the Japanese army arrived at Jilin Station, forced their stay there until midnight. Then, the Japanese army entered the city, occupying the telegraph bureau, telephone bureau, radio station, arsenal, water company, electric light factory, military supplies depot, Bank of China, Jilin Provincial Bank, and all military institutions, police stations, and public institutions such as the Jilin Provincial Party Headquarters. All city gates and main streets were guarded by the Japanese army. Chinese infantry and cavalry were sent to all streets and alleys, and all incoming and outgoing pedestrians were thoroughly inspected. The Japanese army entering the city was the Second Division and the Third Company, with its headquarters located at the Japanese</p>

<p>Taihe Hotel. Other Japanese troops were scattered inside and outside the city walls. On the 22nd, Japanese Commander Tamon ordered Xi Qia to disarm all Chinese troops leaving the city and ordered that the weapons be presented at noon on the 23rd, otherwise military action would be taken. The next day, Tamon ordered Japanese Colonel Tsuboi to become the chief of the Jilin Police Department, leading the disarmed Chinese police. After the reorganization of the police department, the following military rules were promulgated: (1) The Chinese police department is managed by Tsuboi. (2) Any Chinese police officers or soldiers who disobey the Japanese army and Japanese orders will be severely punished. (3) The Chinese police department will report to the Japanese military commander and arrest Chinese people who obstruct the actions of the Japanese. (4) The Chinese police should report to the Japanese military commander and arrest Chinese people whose actions endanger the safety of Japanese people in Jilin. (5) Chinese police who disobey the Japanese military commander and Japanese orders will be severely punished by military law. On the same day, Xi Qia collected more than a thousand rifles from the Jilin Military Academy and the 10th Brigade. The remaining Chinese troops in Jilin were not disarmed because they had already moved to the interior, and Xi Qia was unable to disarm all Chinese troops. Tamon imprisoned him in the Taihe Hotel, the Japanese army headquarters, with Japanese soldiers threatening him with guns for an hour. At the same time, the Japanese military commander put forward the following conditions for Xi Qia to accept: (1) Reorganize the provincial government. (2) Dissolve the provincial committee. (3) Appoint a new civil and military leader. (4) Abolish the committee system. (5) Adopt the dictatorship of the civil and military leader. Under the above circumstances, Xi Qia was forced to agree at that time. Tamon then turned his anger into a smile, and the matter of disarming the Chinese army was delayed. Thereupon, the Japanese forcibly obtained the right to rule Jilin from the Chinese authorities, and with Colonel Tsuboi as their representative, used the power of bayonets to direct government affairs. On September 23rd and 24th, looting took place in Jilin. All the field guns, light and heavy military vehicles, and important and valuable items stored in the Jilin Arsenal were looted. On the 25th, the Japanese Third Company returned to Changchun, and the 15th Company went to Jilin to replace them. The Japanese army distributed themselves throughout Jilin City as follows: (1) The 15th Company resides in the South Manchurian Railway dormitory in Baocheng Hutong, East City. (2) The 30th Squad resides in the Jilin Military Department. (3) The First Team resides in the Jilin Provincial Department. (4) The First Company is the same as above.

(20) The Cavalry Team resides next to the foreigner, Klein. (21) The Guard Team resides in the Hengmao Flour Mill. On October 5th, more than 500 Japanese troops returned from Dunhua, the end point of the Jidun Railway. This team was dispatched to Dunhua on September 23rd. After returning to Jilin, they were stationed in various important areas inside and outside the city. The Japanese troops installed running water and telephones wherever they lived. The Japanese army also dug trenches along the Jichang Railway and erected cannons on Xihuanxi Mountain, Beihuanxi Mountain, and the Dongjiang Bridge. Recently, the Japanese army established a 3,000 square foot airfield on the left bank of the Songhua River, east of Jilin City and north of the Jichang Road, 1.5 miles away, regardless of who owned the land and the unharvested crops of poor farmers. With the Japanese army's full military preparations, everything in Jilin is in their hands. Under the rule of the Japanese army, the Japanese began to plunder everything they had long desired, treating Jilin and other parts of Manchuria as the second Korea, regardless of all previous international treaties, China's sovereignty in Manchuria, and the Japanese representative Yoshizawa's statement at the League of Nations that no matter what recent military actions took place, the Japanese had no intention of aggression. Violating all faith, they will complete a permanent occupation through military occupation. On September 30th, the chief of the Japanese Police Department ordered Xi Qia to abolish the Deputy Military Department and the Jilin Provincial Government organization. On the same day, the Japanese established a Japanese-style military and political office with Xi Qia as a puppet. Under the supervision of Tsuboi, the chief of the Japanese Police Department, and Tamon, the Japanese commander, an inauguration ceremony was held. During the inauguration ceremony, Xi Qia and the two Japanese people on either side of him, as well as the audience, were photographed by Japanese reporters. The Japanese side intended to separate Jilin from the Chinese central government and establish a protected government under the command of the Japanese army. This can be proven by the local governments currently established. Since the Japanese army arrived in Jilin, the following actions have taken place: (1) All Chinese gatherings are strictly prohibited. (2) The publication of all Japanese military actions is strictly restricted. (3) All privately owned firearms allowed by Chinese law are confiscated. (4) People traveling on the streets from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. are strictly inspected. (5) Chinese-dressed Japanese detectives are spread throughout the city. (6) All Korean prisoners, regardless of their crimes, are released. (7) Anti-Japanese Koreans are arrested. It is rumored that six people have been shot and killed by the Japanese. (8) The Japanese army and Japanese aircraft are distributed throughout the suburbs and other areas every day, and many tragedies have occurred. (9) Han Jingyuan (transliteration), the director of the Chinese military law office, was arrested and imprisoned in the Japanese consulate because Han ruled against Korean prisoners against the will of the Japanese. (10) Shi Luben, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Director of Jilin, was ordered to leave Jilin within five days for failing to salute the Japanese military commander. (11) All Chinese people are not allowed to use telegrams. (12) The Japanese army destroyed the radio station, making it unusable. (13) Ten days ago, the Japanese military commander seized 200,000 yuan in cash from the Jilin Provincial Treasury and ordered the Chinese treasurer not to disclose it. (14) The residences of important people in Dongguan were all looted, and all valuables were taken away. (15) All books by Sun Yat-sen and pamphlets of the Kuomintang were arrested and confiscated. Pictures of Sun Yat-sen were also confiscated. (16) The Japanese army ordered those carrying books in the streets to stop and be thoroughly inspected before being released. (17) The Japanese army paid special attention to school teachers, male and female students, and often entered girls' schools. (18) Before the arrival of the American consul and his staff, most of the Japanese army retreated to Lianhuabao to avoid displaying a large army at the city gates and streets. (19) Every day, the Japanese army patrols the streets and alleys of the city to collect materials in preparation for compiling a military map of Jilin City and its suburbs. (20) The Japanese military commander recently forced Xi Qia, the so-called Chinese governor of Jilin Province, to hire three Japanese people, one as a technical and political advisor to the provincial government with a monthly salary of 800 yuan, and two with a monthly salary of 300 yuan. Although their actual responsibilities in the provisional government have not yet been made public, they are nothing more than supervising the current government. (21) Yesterday morning, the police department announced that the Japanese army would conduct artillery drills from October 11 to 17, from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. every day. Cannons were set up in Dongdatan with the old gunpowder bureau as the target. In addition to the above actions, the Japanese army occupied Tongliao, Xinmin, Yingkou, Niuzhuang, Taonan, and Yingpan in addition to occupying Shenyang and Changchun. The above locations were all occupied after the Japanese representative declared at the League of Nations that the Japanese government had begun to withdraw Japanese troops outside the South Manchurian Railway. Jilin and the other locations mentioned above are all far from the South Manchurian Railway. In any case, according to previous treaties, the Japanese had no right to station troops in the above locations. We do not know on what legitimate grounds the Japanese sent troops to the above locations, but the Japanese intend to sabotage the Manchurian railways in order to obtain a monopoly on Northeast transportation for the South Manchurian Railway. The above locations are the intersections of important railways. The above is an accurate report of the Japanese army's activities in Jilin, obtaining control of the Jilin government, preparing for or currently preparing for the permanent occupation of Jilin, violating the official international statements of Japanese diplomats, the shameful behavior of Japanese officials and soldiers, inhumane measures, and painstakingly avoiding publicizing the facts to the world. China, Japan, and other civilized countries are all signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which is an instrument for maintaining world peace. China has submitted this case to the League of Nations for a fair resolution. Due to limited space, we fully state the factual facts. All my readers, with their own impartial opinions, should assist in eliciting international public opinion to oppose any country that attacks another country regardless of all international laws and customs, so that we can guide the world to lasting peace."</p>
<h3 id="e75">Yuan Jinkai Discusses the Shenyang Incident <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Forced Him to Form an Independent Government</p>
<p>Refused Zhang's Return to Shenyang and Separation from the Central Government</p>
<p>He Has Expressed His Rejection of This Move</p>
<p>Tianjin News: Recently, two German journalists, accompanied by An Dake, visited Yuan Jinkai, the chairman of the Liaoning Local Maintenance Committee, in Shenyang for a lengthy discussion. Although much of what Yuan said was self-justification, he did not conceal the fact that the Japanese forced him to form an independent government. The following is An's record of the conversation between the two parties: The German journalists arrived at the Shenyang Local Maintenance Committee at 2 p.m. on the 15th of this month. Wang Rujiu had made prior arrangements. After submitting their calling cards, they were received by Yuan. After exchanging greetings, the German journalists first stated their intentions and their experiences in Jilin and Harbin, and wanted to know the recent situation and changes in Liaoning. Yuan said frankly: "Since this unfortunate incident occurred suddenly, our officials, soldiers, and police have all left the provincial capital and fled. I (Yuan refers to himself) was originally a scholar, and could have gone elsewhere at that time, but I couldn't bear to see my hometown suffer again, so I acted out of my personal conscience and organized the Maintenance Committee. I usually interacted with the Japanese, and had many old friends. This time, the organization of the Maintenance Committee was not opposed by the Japanese. Now the Liaoning provincial capital is much quieter than it was a few days ago. As for the overall situation, I would like to tell you all about it. The Japanese have come to persuade me about forming a new government, but I have insisted that I do not want an independent government to be established, so I have established this Maintenance Committee to support this situation. But it is temporary in nature. I will do my best in the Maintenance Committee for as long as it lasts. As for the various institutions that must be established, they have now been newly established. The Japanese have also placed advisors in various institutions, who will withdraw as soon as the new government is established. I have not signed anything for any matter, nor have I recognized any conditions on their part. The Japanese do not want Deputy Commander Zhang to return, not because they do not want Marshal Zhang to return, because he is a military man, nor do they want Chairman Zang to return to office, because he is an official. The Japanese think that I am a local gentleman in Fengtian and can organize an independent government, but I have refused. I will use an analogy. Fengtian is like a large family. The head of the family is away and has not returned. The uncles and brothers of the head of the family can be responsible for everything. The Marshal can be compared to an uncle, and Chairman Zang can be compared to a brother, and I am the teacher of the family, who can only watch over the house while the master is away and cannot rule in his place. Therefore, at this time, if anyone takes anything from the house, I will only watch. The Japanese know that I do not want to organize a new government, so they have not forced me. However, the organization of the Maintenance Committee can only muddle through for a while. It is feared that there will be changes over time, or that a third party will succeed me and organize a new government. But the Japanese cannot force me to become independent now. During this period of no government, some unscrupulous people want to take the opportunity to cause trouble. In my personal opinion, the Japanese do not want young Marshal Zhang to return here. According to the Japanese, the Japanese killed Marshal Zhang, so suspicion and emotion are naturally incompatible. But the Japanese also do not want the Nanjing government to send personnel here. The Japanese do not want to have any relationship with the National Government, but they do not intend to take away the three eastern provinces immediately. The Japanese intend to establish an independent new government under Japanese supervision, with a majority of Japanese officials. Wouldn't that become the second Korea?"</p>
<p>(German journalist): "In your opinion, how long will it take to come to an end?"</p>
<p>(Yuan replied): "I initially thought that the negotiations could be completed within one or two months. If the Japanese insist on establishing an independent new government, then I dare not say how long it will take. In short, I sincerely hope that our authorities will find a way to resolve this matter as soon as possible. At present, the Japanese know that no one is willing to organize a government, and many Japanese ronin have gone to the Mongolian border to promote independence. This is really worrying. The Japanese know that Chiang and Zhang are planning to declare war on Japan. The Japanese have long been prepared and say that if Japan wins the war, it will definitely take the three eastern provinces."</p>
<p>(Journalist): "Is there any news that Commander Kan Du is organizing a government?" (Yuan replied): "Kan is also very concerned about the local establishment of the Maintenance Committee, but the Japanese have a slightly worse feeling towards him, so it was merged with our Maintenance Committee and he was invited to be the deputy director. As for the level of organizing a government, he may not be willing to do it now."</p>
<p>(Journalist): "Is it Wang Xiaobo (Chengbin) who was invited out by the Japanese to organize a government?"</p>
<p>(Yuan replied): "Xiaobo is a very good person and very talented. He has always lived in Dalian. There is no news of Wang coming here for this kind of thing."</p>
<p>(Journalist): "Is Zhang Zongchang also active on their side?"</p>
<p>(Yuan replied): "Zhang Zongchang is not from Fengtian. His reputation in Shandong was very bad. The Japanese once came here to seek my opinion. I said that if Japan has no intention of harming the three eastern provinces, there is no need to invite him out."</p>
<p>(Journalist): "How has the industrial and commercial industry been since the incident?"</p>
<p>(Yuan replied): "Of course, it is not as good as before, but from today onwards, the three eastern provinces' official silver companies and Bianye banks have resumed business, which is very good for local finance. I once declared that the reason why I came out to maintain the local area is to reduce the suffering of the people. I let people laugh and scold me."</p>
<p>(Journalist): "I heard that the Shenyang-Zhangjiakou Railway has been opened to traffic, is that true?"</p>
<p>(Yuan replied): "This road has been opened to traffic because food can be transported from the north. There are also Japanese people in the railway bureau. The Japanese side requires all institutions to open and place people inside to monitor them. Only the mayor of the municipal office is a Japanese person. The rest of the office is headed by a Chinese person. Since the leader is a Japanese person, all affairs should be the responsibility of the Japanese." (Journalist): "When will schools start? Do you know if the Northeast University factory has started construction? Also, how will the official shares of the Shenyang-Hai Railway be handled?" (Yuan replied): "It is too early to talk about school. I don't know about the construction of the factory. I heard that the official shares of the Shenhai Railway have been taken by the Japanese."</p>
<p>(Yuan asked the journalist): "Did you meet with Director Xi in Jilin?"</p>
<p>(The journalist replied): "I didn't meet him, only Secretary Zhang met with him on his behalf."</p>
<p>Yuan said that Jilin is a special situation different from Fengtian. Xi is the deputy marshal and the acting civil and military officer in charge, so there is the matter of organizing a government. I am not like that. It is not appropriate to organize a government in Fengtian without Chairman Zang's consent. If the Japanese insist on asking me to organize a government, it would be okay in the short term for the sake of the overall situation, but if we become permanently independent and participate in many Japanese officials, wouldn't that be the same as Korea, being protected by Japan and being slaves of a subjugated country? Now it is a case of "having officials but no people." This time, the personnel of all important institutions were all invited by me. They were all unwilling to take office at first. I said that there is no problem with doing things, and one person will bear the burden, which has nothing to do with the public."</p>
<p>(Yuan asked): "How is the situation in Harbin?"</p>
<p>(The journalist replied): "Harbin and Heilongjiang both obey Commander Zhang, but the finances are slightly chaotic."</p>
<p>Yuan said that he had just received news that the finances were better than before. A few days ago, the local finances were also very chaotic. From today onwards, it will only cost six yuan to remit Tianjin silver dollars per hundred yuan. If you use one yuan locally, it will be counted as one yuan without any discount. In the past twenty days, my important work has been to recruit two thousand self-defense police and six hundred security guards. The Japanese have returned a small number of guns, and local order has gradually been restored. Since then, businesses and banks have also resumed operations one after another, and the court will also open. The Japanese have not asked to send officials to join, and the Japanese also know that the judiciary is independent."</p>
<p>The journalist said that he had met with the Marshal in Jin County. At that time, the situation in Jilin was still good, and the Marshal instructed us to go and see them so that they could work with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Yuan said that the Marshal had also sent people to contact me and told me that I could come forward to maintain the situation as I saw fit, but I was very unwilling to establish more institutions. The Japanese had asked the Finance Department to handle it separately. I said, "How can there be another Finance Department in Jinzhou?" The Japanese said that they could expel it and dissolve it. Unexpectedly, Jinzhou was bombed later.</p>
<p>(Yuan asked): "Why did the Beining Railway stop for a day?"</p>
<p>(The journalist replied): "The Japanese transported three thousand people to the Liaohe River, claiming to suppress bandits. It is now open to traffic."</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Japanese Also Request the Extension of the Chongqing Japanese Concession <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Threatening Liu Xiang with Gunboat Diplomacy</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Since the bad news of the Japanese army's invasion and occupation of the Northeast spread, the people of Jiangba have been extremely indignant. The military, government, and party have all been busy holding meetings to discuss countermeasures. Although the specific measures are pending negotiation, the determination to unite against Japan is generally visible. Liu Xiang was even more激烈的 because he was intimidated by the written letter of the Japanese Consul General in Chongqing, Aono Chotaro. The anti-Japanese atmosphere in Chongqing was once tense because the people were eager to recover the Wangjiatuo Japanese Concession. Because of repeated telegrams from Nanjing instructing the people not to cause other troubles, the people of Sanba, although they had a direct proposal to recover it, returned to silence. Recently, the people have arisen again because the Japanese army has occupied the territory of the Northeast. The Japanese consul has repeatedly sent letters to Liu Xiang requesting him to stop this, and three warships have been transferred from Hanyi, one of which has arrived and the others will arrive to carry out armed preparedness in the name of protecting the Wangjiatuo Japanese Concession. Recently, Consul Aono also sent a letter to Liu Xiang requesting the renewal of the Wangjiatuo Concession agreement, limiting the time for signing, otherwise, he would not be responsible for any major changes. According to the brief history of the Wangjiatuo Japanese Concession, after the Sino-Japanese War in the 20th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1894 AD), the Treaty of Shimonoseki was agreed to allow Japanese merchants to trade in Sichuan. After the Japanese arrived in Chongqing, they saw that the products of Sichuan Province were abundant and they were very envious. They used the excuse that there were more and more overseas Chinese and leased land for residences to facilitate special management. The Qing officials did not know what national rights were. In the 22nd year of Guangxu, the Chongqing Wangjiatuo Japanese Concession land base was agreed. In the 27th year, the Sichuan Governor-General and Acting General Kui Jun (Manchu) in Chengdu sent the Sichuan Eastern Military Preparation Dao and concurrently handled commercial affairs. Bao Fen and Yamazaki Kei, the Japanese consul stationed in Chongqing, finalized all matters relating to the concession. The public used the name of the public welfare office to purchase private land and demarcated a length of 100 zhang and a width of 105 zhang and 2 chi as the Japanese concession. A thirty-year return agreement was signed, totaling 22 articles, entitled "Chongqing Japanese Merchants' Special Concession Agreement." Counting on fingers, this year has reached the end of the thirty-year period. The people of Jiangba hold this reason and are eager to recover the entire territory. Therefore, the Japanese first coerced the Chongqing authorities to continue to sign an agreement in order to deal with Liu Xiang, who said that this matter should be decided by the central government. The local officials under the rule of the National Government do not have the power to sign treaties. At the same time, the people were very indignant and held a citizens' meeting on the 28th to support the government's diplomacy.</p>
<p>Earlier, the people of Jiangba had long been prepared to automatically recover the Wangjiatuo Japanese Concession on the south bank of Chongqing because it was about to expire. Recently, the relationship between China and Japan has deteriorated due to the major changes in the Northeast. Aono Chotaro, the Japanese consul stationed in Chongqing, feared that the people would actually rise up automatically, which would inevitably lead to many misunderstandings. He visited Liu Xiang a few days ago and asked for a solution. Liu refused to see him because he was busy, so he returned to his office in disappointment. On the 21st, he sent an official letter to the 21st Army Headquarters, saying that the Wangjiatuo Japanese Concession was officially leased by the Chinese government in the 26th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, not occupied by itself. Now, although the term has expired, additional rent can be paid. If it is to be recovered, it must wait until Chinese law is effective and judicial reforms have a definite guarantee for foreign residents before it can be discussed. Now I hear that the Jiangba rogues will carry out barbaric actions to automatically recover it, and I ask you to stop it to avoid accidents. Otherwise, the Japanese warships in Chongqing will fear that an unfortunate event will occur for self-defense, etc. After reading it, Liu, in addition to ordering the Baxian government to pay attention to prevention, immediately telegraphed the central government to request instructions.

<h3 id="e77">Petitions to the National Government from Beijing's Academic Circles <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Seven Points Proposed</p>
<p>Received by Kong Xiangxi</p>
<p>On the 20th, at 8 a.m., all schools in the capital held a citywide student assembly at the Zhongnan Middle School playground in Shibanqiao. More than 10,000 students from National Central University, Jinling University, and various middle and primary schools attended. After the chairman, Yuan Qijiong of National Central University, presided over the ceremony, the chairman first reported the significance of the meeting, followed by a discussion of the following proposals: (1) Promote peaceful unification; (2) Oppose direct negotiations before the Japanese troops withdraw; (3) Severely punish traitors; (4) Intensify military preparations to fight for world justice; (5) Restore popular movements; (6) Issue firearms to volunteer soldiers; (7) Implement a steel industry policy. All were unanimously passed on the spot. Finally, a declaration and two telegrams, one to the League of Nations and one to Shi Zhaoji, were approved. The meeting then adjourned and the participants formed a procession to demonstrate. National Central University and Jinling University served as the chief and deputy commanders. The procession first went to the National Government to petition. Fifteen members of the assembly's presidium entered the government to request an audience with Chairman Chiang. Chiang sent Kong Xiangxi and Minister of Education Li Shuhua to meet with them. The representatives stated their intentions and then presented their petition, requesting a response to the public. Kong agreed and accompanied the representatives to the front of the National Government's gate to address the crowd. He said, in essence, that the purpose of your studies is to serve the country and society after graduation, to make the country prosperous and the people happy in accordance with the Principle of People's Livelihood. Since Japan forcibly occupied the Eastern Provinces, you have continued to study as usual, but you have never forgotten your patriotic movement. This patriotic enthusiasm is enough to wash away the shame of "five minutes of heat" on the one hand, and to urge the government to strengthen diplomacy with the strength of the people on the other. Government colleagues are very pleased with your actions, because the government is a government for the people, and should rely on the people for support. Without the support of the people, the government cannot show its strength. You are all intellectuals, and such patriotism gives China great hope for the future. Regarding the seven points you requested: (1) To promote peaceful unification, the Guangdong representatives have already departed from Hong Kong for Shanghai. Last night, representatives of the central comrades also went to Shanghai to welcome and negotiate with them. Within two or three days, they will come to Nanjing to cooperate and achieve peaceful unification. Today, you listed this matter as the first, which shows your eagerness for peace. I think that the representatives will see this and be able to sacrifice everything to share the responsibility of saving the country; (2) There must be no direct negotiations before the Japanese troops withdraw. The National Government has decided that no matter how Japan oppresses us, we will never negotiate if the Japanese troops do not withdraw. Please rest assured on this point; (3) Severely punish traitors. In the past, because rewards were more numerous than punishments, traitors often escaped punishment, so that they were not afraid. In the future, if there are any more traitors, the government will punish them according to the law to satisfy the public; (4) Intensify military training to fight for world justice. Since the Mukden Incident, not only soldiers have been waiting in readiness, but the people are also willing to sacrifice for the country. This shows the patriotic enthusiasm of the people. Chairman Chiang recently stated that China is not only a member of the League of Nations, but also a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. If anyone does not uphold justice, China is willing to sacrifice everything to uphold justice. This is the determination of the Central Government, which I can tell you; (5) Restore popular movements. Since the suppression of the communists, there have been some restrictions on popular movements due to various reasons, but they are not absolutely prohibited. The government welcomes orderly actions like yours today; (6) Issue firearms. The government has already instructed the Directorate General of Training to plan everything. If there is a real need in the future, the government will issue them; (7) Implement a steel industry policy. The government and the Ministry of Industry are already planning this matter, which is extremely important to the development of industry in the future. The government will pay attention to it. Kong also said that in the past, foreigners considered China to be a sleeping lion, and some even said that China was like a sheet of loose sand. Looking at China's situation today, we can wipe away the shame of this statement. I still hope that you will take today's patriotic spirit back to your hometown and awaken the people to unanimously support the government. Then, there is nothing to fear. After Kong's speech, the students marched and demonstrated according to the planned route. Military music led each team, and slogans were shouted along the way. Leaflets were distributed. The onlookers on both sides were extremely crowded. After 1 p.m., they arrived at the Central Party Headquarters to petition. Ding Weifen, Chen Lifu, Cheng Tianfang and others responded separately before they returned to their schools.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Anti-Japanese Grand Parade by Academic Circles in Wuhan <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Held Separately in Wuchang and Hanyang</p>
<p>Declaration Issued by the Anti-Japanese General Association</p>
<p>A HanKou dispatch reports that to resist the violent Japanese and save the country from danger, the academic circles of Wuhan organized the Anti-Japanese National Salvation General Association in Wuchang and held a parade and demonstration on the 19th in Wuchang and Hanyang to promote the attention of all sectors of the public. In Wuchang, a total of more than 10,000 people from 37 schools gathered at the Yue Ma Factory. At 9 a.m., a meeting was held to appoint Wu Yutian, a representative of Wuhan University, as the general chairman, and Xiong Wu of the Police Academy as the general commander. First, the chairman reported the significance of the meeting, and then the general commander reported the parade route and order. The parade started with universities and colleges as the first group, primary schools as the second group, and middle schools as the third group. Four students from the Police Academy served as guides, and two students from the Police Academy served as marshals in each team. After departing from the Yue Ma Factory, the parade passed through Da Chao Street, Bao'an Gate, Zhimailing, Lanling Street, and turned to Hanyang Gate, where the teams dispersed. The parade was very orderly, with participants shouting slogans along the way. In Hanyang, more than 1,000 people from more than 10 schools gathered at the large playground of the Provincial No. 12 Middle School at 9 a.m. The director of moral education of the Provincial No. 3 Middle School was appointed as the general commander. After the meeting, the teams were organized and departed from there, passing through Hanyang Main Street to Ximenkou, turning to the area near Turtle Mountain, and the teams dispersed at 12 noon. At 1 p.m., Wuchang and Hanyang simultaneously carried out a general anti-Japanese propaganda campaign. All schools dispatched lecturers to deliver impassioned speeches on the conspiracy of Japanese aggression against China and the tragic situation of the ravaging of the three northeastern provinces, hoping that all compatriots would rise up together to seek self-rescue as soon as possible. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation General Association issued a declaration advocating four things: (1) Arming the entire population and actively preparing for war; (2) Thoroughly severing economic relations with Japan; (3) Promoting the peaceful unification of the country; (4) Expanding the anti-Japanese national salvation organization. A telegram was sent to the Central National Government, requesting preparation for a declaration of war against Japan, and a telegram was sent to the whole country to concentrate efforts and fight to the death. The original telegram read: (1) Respectfully submitted to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government: It has been nearly a month since the violent Japanese forcibly occupied Liaoning and Jilin. Our government and people have maintained calm and restraint and have not resisted, but the atrocities of the Japanese army have increased. Recently, they have bombed Jinzhou and increased their ships inland, shocking the world and angering the whole country. Although the League of Nations has convened two meetings, judging from past precedents, it is expected that there will be no effect. At this time, when the nation is in imminent danger, we must quickly decide on a plan to survive to the death. The association unites the Wuhan academic circles and vows to do its best to resist Japan from beginning to end. We respectfully request that the Ministry and Government make preparations for a declaration of war with the greatest determination. The opportunity for survival is at hand. With tears, we respectfully submit this telegram for your consideration. Respectfully, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation General Association of Wuhan Academic Circles. (2) Respectfully submitted to all compatriots across the country: It has been a month since the violent Japanese forcibly occupied Liaoning and Jilin. Their barbaric acts continue unabated. While we suppress our voices and swallow our tears, we truly cannot bear the pain of self-humiliation. Over the years, the people of the country have merely indulged in emotions and party divisions have been divergent. Politics have deteriorated day by day, and the people's livelihood has become increasingly difficult. Internal strife has not been quelled, and external troubles have come. The nation is in danger at this time more than ever before. The association unites the Wuhan academic circles to face the national crisis and save the country by resisting Japan. We only rely on our strength. We hope that all compatriots across the country will be aware of the danger and eliminate all private opinions. Thoroughly awaken and sincerely unite. Gather the strength of the entire nation to fight to the death with the Japanese pirates. With blood, we present these words for your wise consideration. Respectfully, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation General Association of Wuhan Academic Circles. (October 19th)</p>

<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association is Obstructed. Since its establishment, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in this county has seized quite a few Japanese goods in recent days. It is now trying to persuade shops to seal up their stockpiles of Japanese goods. Unexpectedly, a party member, Dai Huidong, went to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association on the 19th and demanded that 30 bags of white sugar that had been seized earlier be returned. Dai is the owner of Hengsheng Store, which imported the sugar. He claimed that it was Taikoo sugar and not Japanese sugar. The chairman of the Anti-Japanese Association, Shen Zuguang, said that the goods had the Tai Chi trademark, which was undoubtedly enemy goods according to the comparison table. Now that it is claimed to be Taikoo goods, there is still suspicion. He is currently attaching a sample and requesting the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association to identify it. Please be patient. Unexpectedly, Dai did not listen and began to roar. He also ran around to negotiate with the Anti-Japanese Association's committee members and the party branch's committee member, Li Junyuan, asking for the goods to be returned. It is said that Committee Member Li seemed to agree, and the Anti-Japanese Committee member, Lu Gongquan, volunteered to go to Shanghai with the Chamber of Commerce staff to inquire in the hope of having Dai reclaim the goods. However, before long, it had spread throughout the community and was opposed by the public. This plan was thus rejected.</p>
<p>Japanese National Discovered at Dayi Bridge. Dayi Bridge Town, located more than ten li north of this county, is a densely populated area and an important passage connecting with Jiangyin. Unexpectedly, a Japanese national was discovered there on the 19th wearing Chinese civilian clothes and wandering the streets. The villagers noticed him and gathered around to watch. Some said that this person was a Japanese spy or had come from Jiangyin to investigate the situation. According to someone, this Japanese person was a relative of a Zhou family in the town, but at this time of national emergency, the sudden arrival of this Japanese person cannot help but arouse suspicion.</p>

<p>Verdict on the Case of Forcible Intercourse with a Young Girl. The case of Bian Jinlong, a tailor worker in Cangbangli outside the west gate of this county, who forcibly engaged in sexual intercourse with A San, the daughter of his cohabitant Jiang Xingzhu, has been investigated and concluded by the Procuratorate and prosecuted. Judge Huang opened a court session to interrogate and set a date for sentencing. At 10 a.m. yesterday, Judge Huang ascended to the second court and summoned Bian Jinlong to the court. After a brief interrogation, he stood up and read the judgment: Bian Jinlong was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for forcible intercourse with an underage girl and deprived of his civil rights for ten years. The unresolved detention days are allowed to be offset against the imprisonment term at the rate of two days for one day. After the judgment was pronounced, he was returned to custody to await the expiration of the appeal period before being sent to prison for execution.</p>
<p>Date Set for Sentencing in the Case of Beating a Senior Relative to Death. Zheng Chunquan, a villager from Zhengjia Alley near Doumenli in the 16th district of the county, used a dry tobacco pipe to beat his father, Zheng Genda, on the left corner of his forehead last month. The next day, his father died of serious injuries. Prosecutor Du went to the village to open the coffin for an inquest and took Zheng Chunquan into custody. Recently, the prosecutor filed a public prosecution. Yesterday (the 20th) at 5 p.m., Judge Huang opened a court session to question Zheng Chunquan. The testimony of Zheng Chunquan and his mother, Zhang, differed greatly. Judge Huang ordered that he be punished in accordance with the second half of the first paragraph of Article 298 of the Criminal Law and scheduled the sentencing for 2 p.m. on the 24th of this month. Lawyer Zou Binghu defended him in court. After that, the court adjourned.</p>
<p>Investigators to Be Sent to Investigate the Case of Trouble Caused by Famine in the Tenth District. The farmers in the tenth district of this county had a conflict with the police team over the famine issue, resulting in the police opening fire and killing three villagers and seriously injuring several others. County Magistrate Tan Yigui immediately telegraphed the provincial government to request punishment. However, the second district party branch of the district sent personnel to conduct a detailed investigation and said, "The trouble was actually caused by the district chief's instructions. The incident location was at Diandang Bridge, more than one li away from the district office. District Chief Wang Hongyu actually ordered the police to open fire and, after the trouble, abandoned the bayonets and guns in the river. Therefore, District Chief Wang is actually guilty of killing innocent civilians without cause."

<p>The Provincial Committee Investigates the Vandalism of the Party Headquarters. After a group of merchants from Wuyi captured a cloth merchant, Hu Ruilin, for being paraded in the streets and placed in a wooden cage, they went to vandalize the county party headquarters and other places and broke open the cage to abduct Hu. Afterwards, the party headquarters urgently telegraphed a report to the provincial party headquarters. The provincial committee has sent Zhou Huapeng to Changzhou on the 19th to investigate the vandalism at the county party headquarters, the Anti-Japanese Association, and the Zhongshan Newspaper Office, and to investigate everything from all sides. In the afternoon, more than 10,000 students and workers gathered at the public sports field and marched in formation to the county government to petition. Zhou Huapeng, a member of the provincial committee, gave a speech expressing the provincial party committee's position that the purpose of punishing the perpetrators must be achieved. Wu Wenbi and Lu Zao, who were injured, were also examined by the county court, and Zhang Chengguan and Ye Jinde, who were involved in the case, were arrested and temporarily taken into custody by the county government. Because the starting point of the case was the Dafengren Cloth Store's opposition to the sealing up of Japanese goods, the store has been sealed up and the public has been informed. The student side has decided to resume classes as usual from the 20th.</p>

<p>Officials Sent to County to Handle Seed Loans. In order to provide disaster relief to agriculture after the disaster by lending seeds to disaster areas, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture had telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to transfer 1,400 tons of American wheat provided by the National Government's Disaster Relief Committee to the department for lending to ten counties, including Baoying. However, American wheat cannot be used as seed, and the deadline is imminent. Therefore, the committee requested Lu Xiaobo, the chairman of the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, to inform the local grain shops or flour mills to first borrow domestic wheat for application. After the American wheat arrives in Shanghai, it will be returned separately. Meanwhile, the department has assigned ten committee members to go to the county to handle the matter.

<p>The Rice Case Between Jiangpu and Liuhe Comes to an End. The rice merchants of Jiangpu and Chu County transported rice through the territory of Chu County to Zhangjiabao on the Chu River, which borders Liuhe. However, due to unmet conditions, the district chief and many others suddenly advocated "striking the border," making it appear to be true. The incident lasted for many days, and more than 300 boats were detained successively, resulting in huge losses for both the rice merchants and the boat owners. The provincial government repeatedly sent two provincial committee members to order the Liuhe industry to release all the boats on the 9th. The case can be said to have come to an end. The telegram from Hu, the Minister of Civil Affairs, in response to County Magistrate Xia, is recorded below, as are the telegrams from Yu and Qi, the two acting telegrams, and the two successive reports. It is known that County Magistrate Hong of Liuhe handled the case improperly. For the time being, he will be given a warning and a demerit. As for the rest, after the Anhui people investigate and find out who opened fire and caused the trouble, the cases will be considered together. The removal and investigation of the chiefs of the fourth and fifth districts have also been clearly ordered. The above are all on file. You should quickly inform the county of this and urge the remaining six grain boats to return to Pu and wait for a legal solution.</p>

<p>The Water Police District Department Asks the County to Raise Public Debt in Cash on Its Behalf. The wages of the water police in the second district of Jiaxing have been in arrears for more than five months. Now, Chief Zhou has requested the province to allocate funds. The province has issued four months' worth, but it has also issued 80% of the old debt public bonds to clear the debts of this province for 20 years, totaling more than 15,000 yuan in face value. Chief Zhou believes that the bonds are difficult to use in the market, so he consulted with the county government to ask the local chambers of commerce and gentry to raise cash on its behalf in order to issue wages to the teams. The county government followed the methods for raising public debt in each district and ordered each district office on the 19th to raise the number of bonds to be paid to the county within five days so that they could be sent to the water police district office for distribution.</p>
<p>Scheduled Meeting to Discuss Important Disaster Preparedness Policies. Jiaxing's autumn harvest this year was greatly reduced, and rice prices cannot be reduced. Rice merchants from various places come to Jiaxing to purchase large quantities of rice for export. It is expected that during the period between the spring and summer harvests, not only will rice prices be high, but there will also be a shortage of grain. Citizens such as Cha Ren of this county telegraphed the province to order the county to form a disaster preparedness organization to prepare funds to purchase rice for storage in case of emergencies. Now, after receiving the telegram from the province, the county government has sent separate letters to local gentry and representatives of various legal organizations to schedule a meeting on the 25th to discuss important disaster preparedness policies to prevent rice shortages.</p>

<p>Profiteering Merchants Paraded Through the Streets. Qu Youchuan, a profiteering merchant from Yiqiao, Xiaoshan, runs a large general merchandise store there. During the sealing up of Japanese goods, not only did he not register as required, but he also colluded with his peers, Yidadafeng Weikang and Nanhua stores Yuanchun Gongtai Kaitai, etc., to take this opportunity to solicit business and hold a large auction of Japanese goods. The local Anti-Japanese Association went to stop them because the stores did not register according to the law but instead engaged in large auctions. Qu actually cursed loudly. After discussion, it was decided at the meeting yesterday to parade Qu Youchuan through the streets with a white flag of a profiteering merchant. The stores were also punished. Officials Cannot Serve in People's Organizations. This time, the counties organized anti-Japanese activities completely by popular initiative. The provincial government previously received orders from the central government that the people's salvation and anti-Japanese activities were indeed the true will of the people, and government offices must not interfere and cannot serve as committee members in the people's self-organized work. The people of Xiaoshan are quite spirited in their self-organized anti-Japanese activities, but officials serving as committee members are in violation of provincial orders and have completely withdrawn.</p>

<p>Among them, the French government purchased and collected the "Snow in Luxembourg" in the National Art Museum. The art critics commented that Xu Beihong should be regarded as the master of the Chinese Renaissance. Xu Beihong must encourage himself. This is about the process of the production.</p>
<p>3. Regarding the promotion of Chinese art:</p>
<p>Upon receiving the order, Xu Beihong came to Europe to uphold the intentions of the government. Receiving the encouragement from all parties, he made extra efforts to promote Chinese art. In recent years, as Europeans' understanding of Chinese art has increased, he did not want to boast about trivial matters. Therefore, he planned to do a larger-scale project, which could not only represent the greatness of Chinese art but also open up new records of international exchanges. When Xu Beihong first came to Europe, his design for this matter was divided into two steps. The first step was to collect modern Chinese paintings for exhibition in Europe. The second step was to sign agreements with European countries for exchange exhibitions to make it a long-term project. Xu Beihong emphasized modern works because there was a reason. Foreigners are already familiar with the value of Chinese ancient art. When discussing Oriental art, they must regard China as a giant. This has long been a conclusion. In recent years, the Japanese government has taken advantage of China's troubles and misappropriated huge sums of money to vigorously promote Japanese modern art, pretending to be the only highest position in the East. Even Europeans generally regard China as the past and only know Japan but do not know China. Xu Beihong saw this and thought about how to make up for it, so he decided on the above plan. When Xu Beihong lived in Paris, he exchanged opinions on art with more than a dozen masters such as A. Besnard, Aman-Jean, Van Dongen, Maurice Doenis, and Landeski, and art administrators such as Paul Leon and A. Deaarroi. Xu Beihong immediately proposed holding a Chinese modern painting exhibition in France first. He immediately collected domestic works to prepare. Then, he made an agreement with the director of the National Art Museum, Mr. Deaarroi, to hold it in Paris in the winter of 1933.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Li Jishen, Yu Youren and Others Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Each Committee Member States That There is No Such Thing as a Conference</p>
<p>Only Committee Members From Nanjing and Guangdong Will Meet to Discuss National Affairs</p>
<p>Former Chairman of the Guangdong Political Council, Li Jishen and his wife, President of the National Government's Control Yuan, Yu Youren, and Central Committee members Wu Tiecheng, Shao Yuanchong, Li Shizeng, Zhu Peide, and Zhou Qigang, due to the imminent arrival of Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei and others in Shanghai, arrived here at around 8:00 AM yesterday. In addition to dispatching military police to provide strict protection, the Shanghai Garrison Command, Public Security Bureau, and authorities from both sides also dispatched Chen Mingshu, Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army, and others to welcome them at the North Railway Station.</p>
<p>Conditions at the Station: Li Jishen and other Central Committee members traveled in three first-class sleeper cars. Li and his wife and son rode in rooms 105 and 106. He was wearing an orange serge long gown. He looked quite plump. In the car, he read newspapers and chatted with friends in a very calm manner. After arriving at the station at 8:05 AM, the committee members got off the train one after another. Li and his wife and others were the last to come out. He shook hands with Chen Mingshu and others, then went out and rode in Chen's car with his young son to rest in a private residence in the French Concession. His wife and other committee members also took cars to their respective residences to rest.</p>
<p>Li Jishen's Speech: Yesterday, Li Jishen told this newspaper's reporter that he came here to meet with the Central Committee members in Guangdong, whom he had not seen for a long time. He had no specific proposals for the peace conference. He firmly believed that with the national crisis at hand, party comrades would definitely unite sincerely and resist foreign aggression. Therefore, the future of the peace conference was extremely optimistic. When asked whether members of the first, second, and third Central Committees would attend the meeting, he said that he had not heard anything about it in Nanjing. This newspaper's reporter also asked Chen Mingshu about the date when the 19th Route Army would open its defense in Shanghai. He said that because of the lack of ships recently, it would take some time to reach Shanghai.</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng's Speech: According to the New Voice News Agency, Wu Tiecheng said that there was no such thing as a preparatory meeting or a formal meeting for the peace conference. Rather than calling it a preparatory meeting or a formal meeting, it would be better to call it a meeting between the committee members from Nanjing and Guangdong to discuss national affairs. Whether a meeting would be held to discuss matters tonight (i.e., last night) after the Guangdong representatives arrived in Shanghai would depend on the time of Wang's arrival. He had seen the opinions put forward by Li Liejun and others on the peace conference, and he thought there was no problem with them. It was still unclear whether Li Liejun, Cheng Qian, Xu Qian, and others would be invited to participate in the future meeting.</p>
<p>Zhu and Shao's Speech: According to the New Voice News Agency, Committee Members Zhu Peide and Shao Lizi said that they came here to meet with the committee members and there was no so-called peace preparatory meeting. Since they were meeting for the country's sake, they took the opportunity to discuss matters and then invited them to Nanjing to discuss national affairs together. Furthermore, it was not yet certain whether Chiang would come to Shanghai, but he would probably arrive today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Yu and Li's Speech: The New Voice News Agency interviewed Yu Youren in the car, and Committee Member Li Shizeng was also inside. The reporter asked for their opinions on the peace conference and the Japanese atrocities. Both of them were unwilling to make any comments, but said that they came to Shanghai not to participate in any conference, and there was no such thing as a formal meeting or a preparatory meeting. They were only meeting with the committee members for a discussion.</p>
<p>Zhou Qigang's Speech: The progress of the peace movement is considerable, and the future is extremely optimistic. After the committee members meet each other, they will definitely put aside all differences and jointly formulate plans for national affairs and unanimously resist foreign aggression. After Wang and others arrive in Shanghai, the two sides will have a discussion, and then the committee members will be invited to Nanjing. As for the date and location of the peace conference and how it will be convened, he had not heard anything about it and it seemed that it had not yet been decided. According to his personal observation, in this consultation, the point of uniting the Nanjing and Guangdong sides seems to be easily resolved. The central government has no preconceptions. The Guangdong committee members will still return to Nanjing to jointly take responsibility for the party and the country and unite to resist foreign invasion. The central government has already restored the party membership of all comrades who were expelled from the party due to political reasons. It is not difficult to resolve previous misunderstandings, so unity is not a problem. If such internal rectification can be avoided, it would be better to resolve it by means of a meeting. Otherwise, it can be easily resolved after the committee members discuss it. Chairman Chiang may come to Shanghai in the next few days to meet with the Guangdong committee members.</p>
<p>Late-Night Talk Among Central Committee Members</p>
<p>Explaining the Opinions of the Nanjing Committee Members</p>
<p>Discussing the Location of the Meeting Today or Tomorrow</p>
<p>Yesterday's Discussion: After the Central Committee members from Nanjing arrived in Shanghai yesterday, with the exception of Li Renchao, eight members including Yu Youren, Zhang Jingjiang, Wu Tiecheng, Li Shizeng, Shao Yuanchong, Shao Lizi, Zhu Peide, and Chen Mingshu, agreed to go to the new residence of Hu Hanmin on Maierxi Ai Road at 5:00 PM to hold a discussion. In addition to the above eight committee members, Liu Luyin also participated. The committee members discussed for about one and a half hours, and left at 6:25 PM. According to the New Voice News Agency, in addition to explaining the opinions of the Nanjing committee members to Hu and others, the meeting also discussed the location of the meeting. It is expected that after the Guangdong representatives arrive in Shanghai today, they will first exchange views at Sun's residence or Hu's residence, in preparation for opening the preparatory meeting. As for the location of the preparatory meeting, it has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Guangdong Representatives Will Arrive This Morning <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Originally Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai Last Night, But Delayed Due to Wind</p>
<p>The representatives sent by Guangdong to attend the peace conference, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, Li Wenfan, Lin Sen, Chen Youren, and others, were traveling on the President Madison, a liner from the Dollar Steamship Company. They were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 7:30 PM last night. All parties were prepared to go to the Pudong wharf to welcome them on time. However, yesterday afternoon, the Dollar Steamship Company and Chen Mingshu and others received a radio report from the liner stating that the ship would have to be delayed until 8:30 AM today (the 21st) due to wind. The welcomers temporarily suspended their departure and will go to the wharf again this morning to meet them. The company will depart from the Xinguang Wharf at 8:30 AM this morning with a small steamship to carry passengers and welcomers. Furthermore, the Special District Citizens' Federation specially dispatched representatives yesterday to welcome Mr. Wang Jingwei with a letter this morning. The letter said: "Reverently, the violent Japanese are wreaking havoc, sending troops to invade the west. The mountains and rivers of the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin have changed color, and the sound of alarms can be heard frequently. The foundation of the country is shaking. At this moment, to resist foreign aggression, we must first quell internal disputes, which has become the common wish of the people. Our federation previously sent representative Wang Hanliang to Guangdong to petition, which we hope has been taken into consideration. Fortunately, you have upheld the late Premier's legacy of peace and national salvation, and comforted the people's pain of hoping for good governance. You are willing to come and work together. We will see peace and unity, lay the foundation of our country, and work together to eliminate the Japanese pirates. Our federation intends to respectfully welcome you on the day of your arrival and will publicly elect representatives Wang Hanliang, Yu Hualong, Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yichen, and Jiang Xinzhao, with more than a hundred representatives from the subordinate branches, to stand and welcome you, to show the Shanghai people's yearning for peace. Our humble sincerity, we hope you will accept with favor."</p>
<h3 id="e106">Hu Hanmin's Actions Yesterday <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Hu Says Steps Will Be Determined After Guangdong Representatives Arrive</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen's Spirit of Universal Love Is Not a Tool for Struggle</p>
<p>After Hu Hanmin moved to 301 Mai'erxi Road, yesterday (the 20th), people from all walks of life continued to visit him in an endless stream. In the morning, groups such as representatives from the dockworkers' union organizing committee, the Chinese Students' Association in Japan, and the Shanghai university anti-Japanese salvation associations, totaling more than 30 people, arrived. Individuals who visited included Li Jishen, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Fumu, Feng Ziyou, and others. Li Jishen and Hu Hanmin had a teacher-student relationship and had not seen each other for more than two years, so their conversation was quite lively, lasting from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m., a total of two hours. After the conversation, they took a group photo to commemorate the occasion before Li bid farewell and left. Subsequently, Wu Tiecheng visited Hu and talked for about an hour. In the afternoon, representatives from the Chinese Nationalist Party's Protection of the Party Comrades Association, representatives of the Jilin people, representatives of the Shanghai publishing industry workers' union, and Zhou Peizhen, Zhang Weichen, and others visited Hu and briefly conversed before departing. As of yesterday, Hu Hanmin had received telegrams of condolences from more than 130 groups. The Honolulu General Branch of the Nationalist Party also telegraphed, recommending Cheng Runquan, a representative to the Fourth National Congress, to convey their condolences to Hu.</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin's Conversation with a News Agency Reporter. Yesterday, after Hu met with his guests, a reporter from the News Agency paid a visit to Hu Hanmin and asked for his views on the prospects of peaceful reunification. According to Hu, the entire process of peaceful reunification must wait until the Guangdong delegates arrive in Shanghai to exchange views before determining the next steps. There is currently no such thing as a preparatory meeting or a formal meeting. As for peaceful reunification, it is something that everyone urgently hopes for, but the outcome depends on whether everyone can truly abandon their personal interests and deeply recognize that the Party and the country are paramount. Most importantly, everyone must be able to acknowledge their past mistakes and correct future ones. However, after peaceful reunification, there must be political reforms, diplomatic reforms, and all measures must be well reformed before it can be called true peaceful reunification, otherwise the result will still be zero. He then said that any proposals from all parties, if they are considered in the interest of the Party and the country, can be submitted sooner or later. In short, Sun Yat-sen's spirit of universal love should not be used as a tool for personal struggle.</p>
<p>Hu's Conversation with Students. At 9 a.m. yesterday, the Chinese Students' Association in Japan sent Yi Zhichao and Shen Zairen as representatives to visit Hu Hanmin. After the meeting, the representatives reported on the recent high-pressure tactics of the Japanese government against overseas Chinese in the academic, business, and industrial sectors, as well as the past work of the delegation and future directions. At the same time, they requested guidance. Hu gave detailed instructions on each point. Regarding the work, it is best to divide the work and cooperate, and it is important to pay attention to publicity. If publicity is limited to shouting slogans such as "Boycott Japanese goods" and "Down with imperialism," it will lose its effectiveness. It is necessary to expose the consistent ambition of Japan and Korea to annex our Northeast China in order to arouse the attention of our compatriots at home and abroad. Secondly, when asked about the delegation's request to the Ministry of Education for funds to cover the travel expenses of all those returning to China, Representative Xiang gave a detailed account of the Ministry of Education's difficulty in approving the request. Mr. Hu expressed great sympathy for the request of all students in Japan to return to China, and immediately instructed a certain member of the Central Committee to ask the National Government to provide travel expenses for the students in Japan to return to China.</p>
<p>Li Yue Arrives in Shanghai. Li Yue, the brigade commander of the Fourth Front Army of Guangdong, was at the forefront of the anti-communists. After the loss of Liaoning and Jilin, he traveled alone to various provinces along the Yangtze River to appeal for peace. When he arrived in southern Jiangxi, he was intercepted by the communists for several days and nearly met with disaster. He has now escaped danger. Hearing that Mr. Hu Hanmin had arrived in Shanghai and that Wang Jingwei and Sun Ke were also coming, he took a flight to Shanghai yesterday and plans to visit Hu today and report to Wang and Sun.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Declaration of the Shanghai Guangdong People's United National Salvation Association <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Declaration of the Shanghai Guangdong People's United National Salvation Association to Promote the Ning-Yue Peace Conference: Respected Ning-Yue ruling officials and compatriots across the country, since the Japanese army's riot in Northeast China on September 18, they have invaded cities, seized land, and killed countless people. Their fierce flames are high and progressing with the times. That violent Japan is not satisfied with swallowing the Northeast and has even created the absurd theory of the complete independence of Manchuria and Mongolia. Their malicious intentions are completely exposed. At this time of national crisis, if we across the country cannot unite sincerely and resist Japan, it will not only allow the brigands to run rampant without fear, but also allow them to enter our homes and completely reduce the Northeast border and the entire Central Plains to the second Korea or the second India. The arrival of foreign aggression originates from self-humiliation. The decline of the Qing Dynasty was due to the昏庸 (hunyong - muddle-headedness and incompetence) of the court, the weakness after the founding of the Republic of China was due to the tyranny of the Northern Warlords, and the lack of progress after the Northern Expedition was due to the division of the Nationalist Party. Therefore, the way to save the country and strengthen it is to first focus on self-strengthening. The so-called human justice and international public reason are all delusional dreams and the pretexts of thieves. This is further confirmed by the hypocritical attitude of the League of Nations after the Northeast Incident. Therefore, from now on, we must only use iron against iron, blood against blood, and unite the strength of the entire country to fight to the death with violent Japan. Fortunately, the Ning-Yue ruling officials, in this time of crisis, saw righteousness and acted bravely, resolved old grievances, and sincerely sought peace and cooperation to plan a united front against foreign aggression. Now that representatives from both sides are about to gather in Shanghai to discuss national affairs, we hope that the ruling officials will earnestly consult and decide on national policies, and rescue our people from the abyss of suffering and place our national foundation on a rock. We also hope that our compatriots across the country will work together to demand and urge that the Ning-Yue peace and unity against Japan be realized. We, as members of the nation, have an inescapable responsibility. Therefore, we unite the townships and clans of the city, unify our will and pace, and vow to be the vanguard of resisting Japan and saving the country, and to be the backing for the peace and unity conference. We hereby declare.</p>

<p>Emergency Notice from the Anti-Japanese Association Yesterday</p>
<p>Confiscated Non-Japanese Goods Can Be Claimed for Return</p>
<p>Please Citizens Do Not Purchase Goods from Xie Da Xiang</p>
<p>Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association Executive Committee Announcement No. 11: It is noted that the former Shanghai Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee issued the 7th announcement, item 3 of the measures for dealing with Japanese goods, "After July 24, those who purchase or transport Japanese goods (industrial raw materials are excluded because there are other measures) will have them confiscated." According to confidential reports, the Xie Da Xiang Tongji foreign cloth store in Xiaodongmen violated the announcement and privately imported Japanese goods and sold them in large quantities. On the 17th of this month, the Association sent personnel to inspect the store. The store obstructed in every possible way and even dared to report to the police, detaining the three inspectors for interrogation. This was a deliberate attempt to undermine the anti-Japanese movement and to promote the sale of Japanese goods. After detailed discussion by the 8th Executive Committee of the Association, it was unanimously agreed that (1) all the Japanese goods in the store should be confiscated; (2) the manager should be handed over to the Disciplinary Committee for punishment; (3) the banking industry should be informed not to provide loans to the store. In addition to the separate implementation of these measures by the Association, all citizens of the city should be notified not to purchase goods from Xie Da Xiang in the future to show their determination. Otherwise, the Association will not be responsible for any goods purchased from the store that are found on the way. Please pay close attention.</p>
<p>Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association Executive Committee Announcement No. 12: For the purpose of notification, the Association has now formulated a form for investigating claims for confiscated goods for the convenience of investigation. Any owner of confiscated goods who believes that the goods are not Japanese and requests their return may bring proof and relevant documents to the secretariat of the Association at Tianhou Temple to obtain the claim form, fill it out according to the instructions, and submit it to the Association for verification. Other letters that do not follow this procedure will not be accepted. For fear of not being fully informed, this announcement is made.</p>

<p>Visit Hu, Request Restoration of Sino-Russian Relations</p>
<p>Oppose Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations</p>
<p>Hu Tigan, Jiang Shoushan, Che Xiangchen, Liu Shilin, Yang Yuxiu, and Liu Mengpo, representatives of the people of Northeast China, have now arrived in Shanghai and were received by the Municipal Party Department, which promised to assist in contacting various schools to report on the Northeast Incident next Monday during the memorial week. Yesterday, Hu and others visited Hu Hanmin to report on their experiences in Beijing, requesting the restoration of Sino-Russian relations, opposing direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, and paying attention to severely punishing officials who have failed in their duties. Hu said that the restoration of Sino-Russian relations could be discussed at the peace conference, and he would never allow China to lose its territory. It is reported that the representatives have already gone to various schools to report on the facts of the Northeast Incident, state the demands of the people of Northeast China, pay attention to the restoration of Sino-Russian relations, and hope that all circles will resolutely resist Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Exhibition of Books on Sino-Japanese Issues <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>In response to the outrageous Japanese occupation of our Northeast, the world is outraged. At the request of the Association, the Commercial Library has specially presented and publicly exhibited books on Sino-Japanese issues. It is reported that the library has collected more than 200 kinds of books and magazines on Sino-Japanese transportation, trade, negotiations, military affairs, domestic goods, and Japanese goods. All citizens should visit, especially the many maps of Northeast China and Outer Mongolia measured by the Japanese Army Department, which detail the traffic routes and military arrangements, which make viewers feel shocked and realize that Japan's plot to seize our country did not begin today. The Shanghai libraries are paying close attention to the collection of books on Sino-Japanese issues. The library requests that the most books published by various bookstores be sent for display to create a grand spectacle.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Anti-Japanese Resistance in Shipping News <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Employees of Japanese Ships Resign. All foreign merchant ships traveling on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River must use Chinese pilots. Since the anti-Japanese national salvation movement began, Chinese pilots on Japanese merchant ships from Hankou upwards, through Yichang and Wanxian to Chongqing, have automatically submitted their resignations to the Japanese shipping companies out of patriotic indignation. Since the 16th of this month, the Japanese ships in the upper reaches have been unable to travel due to the lack of pilots. In addition, the Chinese workers on the Japanese ship Changfeng Maru, which travels on the Sichuan River, have all resigned and left the ship. This ship has also been stopped.</p>
<p>Workers Refuse to Unload Japanese Goods. The Osaka Company's Sherpis Maru arrived in Shanghai from Southeast Asia, carrying 1,000 tons of rice from Siam and other places, to be unloaded at the Yitai Hing Wharf. Driven by patriotism, the workers at the wharf refused to unload the Japanese ship's cargo. Another Japanese ship was also treated in the same way. Later, the Japanese spent a large amount of money to change the ships and unload the goods.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships No Longer Go to Xiamen. The Osaka Company has many ships on the Xiamen, Shantou, Guangdong, and Taiwan routes. After a unified boycott by the industrial and commercial sectors, it telegraphed to order all ships to abandon the port of Xiamen. At the same time, the Japanese in Xiamen colluded with the Taiwanese to stir up trouble in every possible way. The Japanese warship Take in Xiamen has taken the opportunity to dispatch marines ashore under the pretext of 調陸戰隊上岸 (tiaoluzhandui shang'an - deploying marines ashore).</p>
<p>More Students Returning from Japan. More students returning from Japan include Yu Shunmin, Yang Jinxi, Lin Xiru, Li Huimin, Yi Xiangying, Yu Zhongyao, Wei Wukuan, Zhou Daru, Tian Zaojia, Yang Shizhu, Wang Jinxiu, and 41 others, who arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo, Kobe, and other places. More are expected to arrive in the next few days.</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Overseas Chinese Returning to China. In recent days, more than 2,000 overseas Chinese have returned to China from Japan. In the past two days, more have arrived in Shanghai on the Chichibu Maru from Tokyo, including Wang Shanchu, Lin Rongkai, and 147 others; on the Shanghai Maru, including Yang Zhaozuo, Zhuang Zhaoxiang, and 238 others; on the Mikasa Maru, including Feng Deyuan and 80 others; on the Tsukuba Maru, including Zhao Dengkui and 46 others; on the Maya Maru, including Ding Fangdian and 60 others.

<p>Inspection Work of the First District Branch of the Municipal Association. Yesterday morning at 9 a.m., the First District Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Federation convened more than 30 people, including all members of the Japanese Goods Inspection Committee and professionals from various industries, and divided them into groups and industries. (Group A) Silk, wool, foreign goods, and cotton weaving industries: inspectors He Guangsheng, Xu Meiqing, Hu Lifu, Zhou Guansong, Yuan Chuanhua, Weng Zhilian, Wu Chuansheng, Li Hede; (Group B) Cosmetics, foreign sundries, pharmacies, photography, and Chinese medicine industries: inspectors Sun Wenyi, Tang Chengzhang, Pan Ruitang, Tang Yutian, Sun Yuxiang, Lu Jinghua; (Group C) Southern goods, wine, vegetables, porcelain, and canned food industries: inspectors Le Fucheng, Yu Yanting, Le Rucheng, Chen Jusheng, Cai Hanzhang, Zhang Lieming, Zhang Songling; (Group D) Electrical appliances, clocks, watches, eyeglasses, stationery, paper, and gramophone industries: inspectors Li Jianliang, Zhuang Zhihe, Chen Duomin, Tao Zhiqian, Bei Shijun, Wu Guorui, Xiang Kejia; (Group E) Tobacco, paper, hardware, jewelry, and other industries: inspectors Wang Lianfang, Fei Xingzhuang, Chen Siyu. They departed at the same time and inspected each household and industry in the Nanjing Road area of the Association, respectively. The members expressed goodwill during the inspection. Most of the stores that had already been sealed up had no Japanese goods left. A small number of stores that had not been sealed up immediately sorted out the Japanese goods on the spot and had them sealed up by the inspectors. Finally, they were affixed with a "Inspected" label. The inspection was completed at 6 p.m. It was decided that from today onwards, a member on duty will be stationed at the Association to wait for members from the General Association to accompany them for re-inspection.</p>
<p>The Municipal Association Begins to Inspect Japanese Goods. The Shanghai Special District Citizens' Association regards the inspection of Japanese goods as the first step in implementing economic severance, and its duties are not to be delayed. A Japanese Goods Inspection Team has been organized and has begun to inspect stores on various roads.

<h3 id="e114">The Chinese Ratepayers Association Again Asks to Stop Japanese Riots <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Please Pay Attention to What Judge Feetham Said about the Rule of Law. The Shanghai Municipal Council Met with the Japanese Side Yesterday.</p>
<p>Indicates that it does not favor any party</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association, in view of the reported Japanese riots and the reports from ratepayers Yang Cheng, Feng Yi, etc., sent another letter yesterday to Mr. Macnaghten, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, "Dear Sir, on October 2, we wrote to your Bureau requesting that it stop the Japanese Marines from freely landing to demonstrate. However, Japan does not regard the League of Nations as an organization that should be respected, and even less does it regard your Bureau as an agency that can be respected. This is why the Japanese Marines continue to land at will and run rampant everywhere, and the Japanese residents incite crowds to carry out disturbances to disrupt public order. However, from your Bureau's point of view, you should value the security and rule of law mentioned by Judge Feetham and use the entire police force to maintain peace and order. If your Bureau tolerates the Japanese residents inciting crowds to run rampant and the Japanese Marines freely landing without seeking effective ways to fundamentally stop them, then your Bureau is showing people a division and weakness of the police force, which will make the residents of the Concession only consider ways to protect themselves in a legitimate manner and assist your Bureau in stopping the Japanese military and civilians from running rampant in the Concession. Regarding the security and rule of law in the Concession, we hereby write to your Bureau to clearly indicate whether it can effectively stop the division of the police force, so as to consider whether to seek other positive and effective methods to maintain peace and order.</p>
<p>According to the "Great Beauty Evening News," this morning (the 20th), Mr. Macnaghten, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Murai, the Japanese Consul-General, and Mr. Fukushima and Okamoto, Japanese directors, the commander of the Japanese landing marines, and Mr. Fessenden, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, and Chief of Police Martin, held an important meeting in the Municipal Council, which lasted until after noon. It is reported that the meeting was at the request of the Japanese authorities and received the full support of the Concession authorities, as both sides were eager to cooperate with each other to maintain security and order in the Public Concession. During the meeting, the Japanese side stated that the purpose of the Marines' landing was purely to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents and had no other intentions. The Municipal Council also said that it welcomed full cooperation, but stated that it had to strictly maintain neutrality in its efforts to maintain order and could not favor any party. The Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities are currently discussing ways for the Japanese Marines and the police to cooperate as much as possible to maintain security.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Hou Dachun and the Overseas Chinese Aid Donation Case <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Hou Dachun, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, previously served as a standing committee member and director of the Inspection Section of the All-Circles Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Aid Committee. He solicited 500 yuan from Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the Commercial Press, in the name of the committee. Because the committee has been reorganized into the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, all previous income and expenditure accounts have been closed and reported. Recently, Feng Yixian, the secretary of the association, discovered the matter and reported it to the Central Party Headquarters on October 12. The original report is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Report for Prosecution: Hou Dachun is accused of fraudulently obtaining money in the name of the Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Aid, embezzling donations for overseas Chinese aid, and is being prosecuted according to law in order to demonstrate national law and party discipline as a warning. Since the Wanxian Massacre occurred, the whole country has been filled with grief and indignation. All circles in this city have organized the Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Aid Committee. Hou Dachun, with the qualifications of an alternate executive committee member of the Municipal Party Department, was designated by the Municipal Executive Committee to participate and was elected as a standing committee member and director of the Inspection Section. He was entrusted with the party's mission to lead the patriotic movement, and should have been self-disciplined, striving, and dedicated to fulfill his duties and repay the party and the country. However, Hou Dachun, losing his mind and going to extremes, fraudulently solicited 500 yuan from Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the Commercial Press, in the name of the Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Aid Committee. On July 24, he sent Wang Yongliang, a staff member of the Inspection Section, to the Commercial Press to affix a seal and collect the money. More than two months have passed, and the name of the Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Aid has been cancelled and reorganized. All donations received from various parties for overseas Chinese aid have also been publicly announced and closed by the Economic Committee. However, the income and expenditure accounts of the Inspection Section have been closed and reported as of the end of September. After searching all income items, there is no item for a donation of 500 yuan from the Commercial Press. According to the previous donations to the Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Aid Committee, receipts were issued at any time, and stubs were filled in, but there is no record of this payment, which can be verified. It is clear that Hou Dachun fraudulently obtained money in the name of fraud, embezzled patriotic donations, deliberately concealed the matter, only cared about his own illegal interests, willingly degraded his personality, broke his promises, regarded party discipline as a mere formality, and national law as insignificant. This is indeed undeniable. Such a large amount of donation is not easily forgotten in miscellaneous accounts, and the omission cannot be remedied by fabricated accounts after the report is made, in the hope of escaping punishment. Based on his status and his actions, he has violated the crimes of embezzlement under Articles 356 and 357 of the Criminal Law, as well as the crimes of fraud and breach of trust under Articles 363 and 366 of the same law. Furthermore, he has violated Articles 1 and 4 of the Regulations on the Crime of Violating Oaths by Party Members, as well as the crimes under Article 1, Section 3 and 5 of the Temporary Law on Increased Penalties for Crimes Committed by Party Members. According to Article 69 of the Criminal Law and the interpretation of the Supreme Court's ruling No. 102 of the second year, Hou Dachun should be sentenced concurrently with an increased penalty. Since the term of imprisonment exceeds the period of imprisonment, he should be permanently expelled from the party according to party discipline. In accordance with Article 6 of the Regulations on the Crime of Violating Oaths by Party Members, evidence has been collected and reported, and in accordance with Article 9 of the procedures for punishing party members and party departments, the matter is hereby presented to your esteemed association for thorough investigation and prompt transfer to the court for detention and trial, in order to uphold the party's prestige and serve as a warning. With utmost respect, this report is respectfully submitted to the Central Executive Committee. Reporter: Feng Yixian, Executive Committee Member of the Sixth District Party Department, currently serving as Executive Committee Member and Deputy Director of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and former Secretary of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Aid Committee.</p>
<p>Evidence: Photographs (omitted) (A) Payment voucher from the Commercial Press, (B) Final settlement of the Inspection Section, (C) Employee receipt of the Inspection Section, (D) First announcement of the Economic Committee, (E) Second announcement of the Economic Committee.</p>
<p>Explanation of Evidence: (A) On July 24, the Commercial Press paid the money, and Wang Yongliang, a staff member of the Inspection Section, affixed his personal seal. (B) The Inspection Section was reorganized into the Inspection and Investigation Sections in early September. This is a total settlement of the 7th, 8th, and 9th months, with a total of eight receipts, all of which can be verified by receipts, but there is no Commercial Press donation listed. (C) Wang Yongliang is a staff member of the Inspection Section, and this is a receipt for living expenses. (D) The first announcement of the Economic Committee does not include the Commercial Press donation (already published in this newspaper). (E) The second final announcement of the Economic Committee also does not include the Commercial Press donation (already published in this newspaper).</p>
<p>Report from the First District Party Department: Requesting severe punishment of illegal acts to uphold party discipline. When the Korean Massacre occurred, all circles in this city organized the Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Aid Association. Anyone with a conscience should have done their best to fulfill their responsibilities and enlighten their conscience in order to seek relief. Hou Dachun, the current standing committee member of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, previously served as a standing committee member and director of the Inspection Section of the All-Circles Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Aid Association. In the name of the All-Circles Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Aid Association, he received 500 yuan from Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the Commercial Press, and sent Wang Yongliang, a staff member of the Inspection Section, to affix a seal and collect the money. The facts are all there, and the evidence is solid. However, when the association was dissolved and reorganized into the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, the Economic Committee published all the relief funds received during the period in Shen Bao and Xin Bao on August 20 and September 20 and declared the end of the association. The Commercial Press's donation of 500 yuan was not mentioned in either of the two announcements. It is undoubtedly the case that Hou Dachun, the person in charge of soliciting donations, swallowed the money. As a party member, he did not know how to keep himself clean and betrayed the public trust by filling his own pockets with public funds for overseas Chinese aid. This is extremely illegal. Therefore, we are specially submitting a report to your esteemed association for verification, requesting that he be immediately expelled from the party and dismissed from his post for severe punishment in order to warn others and protect the party's reputation. This would be in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Central Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Report from the Fifth District Party Department: The Fifth District Party Department's document on Hou Dachun's malpractice requests a thorough investigation in order to uphold party discipline and maintain the party's prestige. Your esteemed association has a party member, Hou Dachun, who is currently a standing committee member of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, an alternate executive committee member of your association, and a former executive committee member of the Commercial Press Trade Union. In the past, he has worked hard for the workers' movement and party affairs and has been loved by his comrades. Therefore, he has served two terms as an alternate committee member of the Municipal Party Department and a representative of the Shanghai industrial circles at the National Assembly. He has now been elected as Shanghai's representative to the Fourth National Congress of the Party. We hoped that Hou Dachun would work hard for the party and seek welfare for the workers. However, during the national unity against Japan, he took advantage of his position as a representative of the workers to become a standing committee member of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and even fraudulently solicited donations in the name of the association and put the money into his own pockets. If this is not corruption, then what is it? Our party is a party that seeks the welfare of the people, and all its members should be clean and self-disciplined, sacrificing themselves to help the people. If someone is taking from the people to benefit themselves, then even one item should not be taken. In recent years, some unscrupulous party members have either used the party's name to deceive others or have taken the opportunity to collect money. This is all due to the lack of enforcement of party discipline, and the party's reputation has declined as a result. The people have doubts about the party. When the association previously heard about Committee Member Hou's bribery and malpractice, we always thought it was a rumor fabricated by villains to slander him. Now, we have received a public statement from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation People's Association reporting the malpractice of embezzling 500 yuan in donations, with five pieces of attached evidence. If the matter is true, then Committee Member Hou's personality will be ruined, and the party's reputation will be completely destroyed. For the sake of the party's prestige, for the sake of eliminating social miscreants, for the sake of purging corruption among party members, for the sake of the future of the anti-Japanese national salvation, and for the sake of Mr. Hou's own personality, it is necessary to request that your esteemed association first suspend Hou Dachun from his duties and conduct a thorough investigation. If the above-mentioned facts are found to be true, then the regulations on punishing party committee malpractices should be invoked and the most severe punishment should be imposed. If the matter is slanderous, then it can be used as evidence to restore the party's reputation. Standing on the party's position, the association cannot remain silent. Therefore, we are submitting the public statement from the people and presenting it to your esteemed association, and we earnestly beg you to implement it promptly.</p>

<p>The Commodity Inspection Bureau Issues a Circular Banning the Practice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry stated that the raw reeled silk produced by villagers is often mixed with impurities such as butter, lard, rice soup, paraffin wax, and sugar in order to increase the weight. In order to protect the quality of the silk, the bureau invited representatives from the silk merchants of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the bureau to discuss solutions together. As a result, the representatives notified the silk firms in the interior of the evidence of adulteration found by the bureau and the negative impact of the practice, and urged them to strictly comply with the regulations. After the discussion, the staff of the Silk Inspection Department of the bureau baked the dry silk that had been mixed with sugar or Bletilla striata in front of the representatives, and the color turned yellow as expected. Then, the bureau staff led the representatives to the chemical testing department to test the previously baked yellow dry silk in person, and it was also proven to be mixed with bran. In order to implement the supplementary resolutions, the bureau has recorded the case and sent a letter to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Merchants Association, requesting that they take note of the matter and handle it accordingly.</p>

<p>Three Stores Suffer, Losses Amounting to Hundreds of Thousands</p>
<p>A fire broke out at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Henan Road yesterday afternoon. The victims were Xihongtang Stationery Store, Runxiangtai Leather Goods Store, and Yangqinghe Fuji Jewelry Store, with enormous losses. The fire started around 12:30 PM. The store employees were preparing for lunch when the fire suddenly descended. No. 406 Xihongtang, No. 405 Yangqinghe, and No. 407 Runxiangtai were all engulfed in the vortex. At that time, the fire seemed to have started from the second floor, so the buildings facing the street and those in the back were spared. The fire was very fierce at the time, with thick smoke spreading everywhere and flames flying wildly, making it impossible to approach. The Central Fire Department, which was nearby, immediately dispatched vehicles after hearing the news and tried its best to put out the fire. After about half an hour, the fire was brought under control. At that time, it was around 1:00 PM, the time when traffic on Nanjing Road and Henan Road was most congested, and traffic was temporarily cut off. After the fire was extinguished, the fire department sent personnel to guard the area, fearing that the remaining embers would cause further damage, and did its best to protect Dalun and Junfeng, so that they would not be affected. Afterwards, it was learned that Runxiangtai suffered the greatest losses, followed by Yangqinghe and Xihongtang. The total loss was estimated to be tens of thousands of yuan. Dalun and Junfeng suffered only slight water damage and were also greatly frightened.</p>

<p>(2) The Issue of Attorney's Fees for Lawyer Tan Yigong</p>
<p>(3) The Issue of Living Expenses for the Huang Family</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Shanghai Riyue Bank and the Great World Tourism Savings Department, Pan Zhaobang and others were appointed by the former French Concession Court to liquidate the assets. On the one hand, the plaintiffs' claims against Ye Shantao and other directors and shareholders were rejected. Therefore, the creditor's agent lawyers Yan Luqing, Dong Yu, Dong Chi, Bian Jialu, Xu Yannian, Chen Zhigao, and Zhou Xiao'an jointly represented the creditors and stated their dissatisfaction by filing a petition with the former French Concession Court for review. (According to the former French Concession Court, only a review could be requested, and there was no appeal mechanism.) Later, because the National Government took back the public courts, the Higher Third Branch Court was established, and the former case was transferred for trial. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Zhao Zhenhai, a prosecutor from the Higher Third Branch Court, sat in the civil court for the trial. He first asked Lawyer Yan and others about the total amount of debt and lawsuits. He also said that lawyers Wu Jingxiong and Jiang Yiping were representing the 3,386 creditor households of Jing Xiren and others, and they had also filed an appeal to confirm the responsibility of the directors and shareholders. The court had already summoned them once. He asked whether the lawyers in question were also going to file an appeal in this case, or whether they would wait for Jing Xiren and others' appeal to be resolved and then handle the matter in accordance with the resolution. Lawyer Yan Luqing said that before the 3,000-plus creditor households of Jing Xiren and others filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court, they had only participated in the French Concession Court. The judgment of the former French Concession Court was based on the request of the lawyers involved. This appeal was based on the arguments of the lawyers involved. It was stated that Jing and others' appeal was after their appeal. Now, the lawyers involved were requesting a consistent appeal. The official then asked the lawyers which of the three major parts of the judgment they were dissatisfied with. Lawyers Dong Yu and Xu Yannian replied: (1) The issue of the responsibility of Ye Shantao and other directors and shareholders; (2) The attorney's fees of 20,000 yuan for lawyer Tan Yigong, the representative of the Huang family, which was awarded by the former French Concession Court. This amount was deducted from the debt, and the creditors were not willing to accept it; (3) The Huang family's request for 60,000 yuan in living expenses, of which 40,000 yuan was awarded by the former French Concession Court. The creditors also opposed the deduction of this amount from the debt. Therefore, they were requesting an appeal. The official then asked whether the judgment of the former French Concession Court was final. The lawyer replied that the former French Concession Court only relied on the court's order as the final judgment and there was no written judgment. At this point, Judge Zhao ordered the creditor's agent lawyers to submit detailed reasons for the appeal and the total amount of the lawsuit within 20 days and to pay the litigation fees before the case could be heard again.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Case of Plotting to Murder Her Husband - Not Accepting the Life Sentence <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Zhang Appeals</p>
<p>The Testimony of Each Witness Remains the Same</p>
<p>Zhu Shisheng, the owner of Nanyang Department Store, located at No. 100 Yangshuo Road, who was a local resident of 53 years of age, had an argument on July 24 of this year at 6:00 PM with his step-wife, Zhang, who was 38 years of age, over the funeral arrangements for his unmarried daughter, Si Mei, who was born to his first wife. He was beaten and injured. He was later sent to Tongde Hospital at No. 1 Tongfu Road for treatment, but he died the next morning at 2:00 AM. The Yangshupu Police Station dispatched detectives to arrest Zhu Zhang and brought her to the First Special District Court, where she was sentenced to life imprisonment. Details have been reported previously. Because Zhu Zhang did not accept the sentence, she hired lawyers Lin Qing and Chen Zemin to file an appeal. Yesterday afternoon, Chief Judge Song Yuan and Judges Du and Ye came to the First Criminal Court for investigation. According to the appellant Zhu Zhang's statement, she had been married to Zhu Shisheng for 19 years, and the case was a complete miscarriage of justice. At 6:00 PM on that day, after the daughter's funeral, everyone was drinking in the parlor. Those present included the neighbor Qiu Songlin, the shop employee Chen Jiying, the relative Yang Changlin, her brother Zhang Changsheng, and her nephew Zhang Heshang. At that time, a group of hooligans suddenly arrived outside. Her husband, upon hearing the news, left his seat and went out to call for help. He was also knocked down by those people, who then fled in a rush. She helped him up and sat him on a stool. She was about to go to the police station to report the incident, but her son-in-law, Zhang Xinglin, said that he would go instead. After a while, he returned and told her to go herself, so she went to the police station to report the incident. When she returned, her husband had already gone upstairs. He said that his body was numb, so she used brandy to rub his chest. Later, he was sent to the hospital, and she went with him. The doctor said that his brain vessels had ruptured. If there was no danger within three days, his life could be saved; otherwise, it would be ineffective. When her husband was dying, she was also by his side. Her son-in-law, Zhang Xinglin, falsely accused her of having an affair and making trouble out of nothing. She asked the court to investigate the matter and stated that she did not beat her husband. She begged for justice. Then, Zhang Heshang testified that Zhu Zhang was his aunt. On that day, it was for his cousin's funeral, and he was also drinking in the parlor with everyone that evening. There were seven people in total. His uncle (the deceased) and Zhu Zhang's brother said that they were fortunate that everyone was present, otherwise the coffin for his daughter would have been difficult to make, which was a sign of domestic unrest. As they were speaking, his aunt (the appellant) suddenly came in from the store and questioned them. His uncle, fearing her, told her to ask her brother. A quarrel and fight then ensued. His uncle ran outside and was dragged back in by his aunt. His uncle called for help and did not fight back, but he did not know where he was injured. At that time, his uncle took a few steps and sat down on the stool, saying that his body was numb. Later, he was helped upstairs, and Zhang Heshang followed him. At that time, his uncle was still able to speak and asked his son, Miaofu (born to the appellant), whether he wanted copper coins. Then, he closed his mouth and did not say anything more. However, when he was being beaten, his uncle suddenly squatted down, and his aunt picked him up. He did not see hooligans arriving and beating him. Then, the shop employee Chen Jiying testified that he was from Changzhou and had been working in the store as an accountant since April of last year. On that day, for the funeral expenses of Si Mei (Zhu Shisheng's daughter), Zhang was determined to reduce all expenses, which led to a dispute. After Mr. Xu mediated, the matter was settled. After the funeral, that evening, when all the relatives and friends were drinking, Zhu Shisheng said to Zhang's brother and others that he was fortunate that they were present today, otherwise his daughter's coffin would not have been able to go out, which made Chen very angry. Zhang entered from the store, and Zhu Shisheng said, "Do you want to slap me in the face?" (The white-eyed person is Zhu's sister). A quarrel and then a fight ensued. Zhu called out "Good!". At that time, someone punched Zhang Heshang. Zhu said that it was none of their business and that it was a quarrel between husband and wife. After a while, Zhu squatted down and called for help, and Zhu Zhang picked him up. Zhu then went outside. At that time, there were many people, and Chen could not see clearly. In the past, the couple often did this. Then, Zhu Shaoying testified that she was a neighbor. At that time, after Zhu Shisheng and Zhu Zhang had an argument, Zhu Shisheng asked a shop apprentice to invite her to scrape his skin to relieve the pain. When she arrived, Zhu said that his legs were numb and he had a headache. She examined him and found that it was not a skin problem, but she rubbed his chest a few times. Later, he scraped his skin himself. Then, Yuan Abao testified that he was a watermelon seller near Zhu's store. At that time, he heard Zhu and Zhu Zhang fighting and saw Zhu running out, wearing slippers. Zhu Zhang pulled him back in and touched his lower part with her right hand. Zhu then fell backwards and called for help, with his eyes rolling back and not saying anything. At that time, Zhu Zhang was shirtless and had a fierce expression, as if she was going to perform some kind of exorcism. When Chen Jiying was questioned, he said that he did not see Zhu Zhang shirtless. He heard Zhu calling for help outside, but not inside. Zhang Heshang also said that Zhu Zhang was wearing a short shirt inside, but he did not see what she was wearing outside. The appellant's lawyer requested a postponement, stating that there would be witnesses arriving for the next hearing. He also stated that since the case occurred, the appellant's store had been closed and that no one was in charge of the money and other matters. He also said that the deceased's coffin was still in the store because the case had not been concluded. For the sake of caution, he requested that the court seal the coffin and store it elsewhere. Chief Judge Song ordered that the case be investigated again and rescheduled for a hearing. The coffin was to be marked and placed elsewhere first.</p>

<p>Wife Unwilling to Stay at Home, Husband Angered and Acts</p>
<p>A woman named Qin Zhang, 32 years old, was from Haimen. She originally lived in her hometown but came to Shanghai on the 11th of this month. Her husband, Qin Shoufan, 34 years old, worked as a butcher at Chen Xinji's pig shop at 55 Yuezhou Road. After the couple met, Qin Shoufan, because he had cotton planted in his hometown, ordered his wife to return home on the 13th and gave her 30 yuan for household expenses and travel funds. However, the woman was naturally licentious and unwilling to return. She cohabited with Fan Shougen, who lived at 50 Jiaxing Road. Her husband received a letter a few days ago, learning that his wife had not returned home. He found her at Fan's house, dragged her out, and took her to the home of his brother, Zhou, at 3248 Puanfang, Zhoujiazui Road. An argument erupted. Qin, in his anger, grabbed a butcher knife from his brother's house and stabbed the woman in both thighs. She fainted from the pain. Qin then went outside. His sister-in-law, Qin Zhu, saw this and screamed. The neighbors heard and reported it to the Chinese police at 2288 and to the Harbin police station, who dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. When they arrived, the woman was already dead. They carried the body to the autopsy room on Feilun Road and arrested Qin on Yuezhou Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Li, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong, a clerk, and others, to the morgue to examine the body. The court convened, and Qin Zhu testified that her husband was out at the time. Only she and her child were at home. She did not witness the argument. Qin Shoufan testified that he was at his brother's house and wanted to ask if she had spent the money. She tried to stab him with a knife, but it fell to the ground. He picked it up and stabbed her twice. He only intended to scare her and did not mean to kill her. After hearing the testimony, Mr. Li declared that the deceased, Qin Zhang, was indeed stabbed to death by her husband, Qin Shoufan. The police have filed charges against the murderer. He will be tried by the court according to the law. The body was returned to Qin Shoufan for burial after he signed a guarantee. The knife was kept as evidence.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Ten Years and Six Months</p>
<p>Xu A'mei, a local resident living at 496 Kangti Road in the French Concession and a committee member of the French Tram Workers' Union, was previously arrested by the French police for inciting a strike. Anti-government books and leaflets were found in his home. He was sent to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The police filed charges according to the law. After repeated interrogations, the trial concluded, and a verdict was scheduled. Yesterday, the verdict was delivered. At 3 PM, Judge Guo Dezhang, along with assessors Zhang and Li, and Prosecutor Zhang, went to the First Criminal Court and ordered the defendant to be brought before the court. After questioning his age, occupation, origin, and address, the verdict was announced. Xu A'mei was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and twelve years of deprivation of civil rights for organizing a group with the aim of endangering the Republic of China. He was also sentenced to three years of imprisonment and three years of deprivation of civil rights for interfering with public electrical services. He will serve a total of ten years and six months of imprisonment and twelve years of deprivation of civil rights. The number of days of detention before the verdict is final will be counted as two days for each day of imprisonment. The books and leaflets seized in the case will be confiscated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the Chinese and French authorities, in order to prevent further unwarranted strikes and disruptions to public order, are preparing to dismiss seventeen workers in the factory who had been in contact with Xu A'mei and were known to be troublemakers.</p>
<h3 id="e128">News of Relief for Flood Victims: Difficult to Raise Disaster Relief Bonds <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Although the issuance of disaster relief bonds has been decided, it has not been conducted in the same way as previous bond issuances, such as consulting with the banking community or allocating quotas to other institutions. The established method is to hand the bonds over to the National Flood Relief Committee to raise funds. However, in these troubled times, these bonds are difficult to raise. Few are willing to underwrite the bonds. However, the National Flood Relief Committee still has a surplus from donations received from various parties, which can be distributed. It is said that several hundred thousand yuan will be available for allocation soon. Also, the Jiangsu Provincial Government borrowed wheat from the Flood Relief Committee through the Department of Agriculture and Mining to exchange for seeds to lend to flood-affected farmers in northern Jiangsu. A formal decision on this matter is expected from the Flood Relief Committee in the coming days.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Relief Association Distributed Four Yuan Each</p>
<p>After the workers of the Shenyang Arsenal fled to Shanghai due to the war, their hardship was indescribable. Yesterday, more than 20 arrived in Shanghai. For over a week, the workers who arrived earlier had petitioned various organizations due to their inability to sustain themselves. Yesterday, they received a reply from the National Government Flood Relief Committee stating that they had received their letter requesting fire support and other assistance for those who fled to Shanghai due to the war and were unemployed. The committee is dedicated to flood relief and cannot allocate funds for other purposes. However, they deeply sympathize with the plight of the group that fled to Shanghai. In addition to having telegraphed Vice Minister Chen of the National Government and Mayor Zhang of Shanghai to arrange for the establishment of factories, they have also written to the Relief Committee to consider providing maintenance assistance. The workers, knowing that someone would consider providing maintenance assistance, sent representatives to visit the Relief Committee. At 1 PM yesterday, the Relief Committee dispatched Chen Kui, together with Sun Xiangsong from the Social Affairs Bureau and Gao Ziqiang, a patrol officer from the Second District of the Public Security Bureau, to the Qu Zhenren Temple to distribute temporary maintenance fees of 4 yuan per person, totaling 1,256 yuan for 314 people. As for arranging for their livelihoods, it must await instructions from the Ministry of Military Affairs. Twenty-four new workers arrived yesterday. The association stated that they had not been reported in advance and would need to be investigated before further assistance could be provided.</p>

<p>The Clothing Assistance Association for Disaster Relief at 207 West Mendl Road, Racecourse, has recently received several letters and telegrams from various provinces requesting the distribution of relief clothing. Although shipments have been arriving in Shanghai daily from various ports, such as Songjiang and Fengjing in this province, and Nanxun and Zhenze in other provinces, totaling over 1,600 pieces of new and old clothing, donations from this port have also been very enthusiastic. However, there is still a shortage. It is reported that Mr. Huang Chunzhou, the director of the association, plans to collect a sum of money and send it to the National Government Flood Relief Committee for unified distribution to avoid duplication.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Donations of Relief Clothing Are Extremely Enthusiastic <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Government Flood Relief Committee has received over 60,000 pieces of old clothing in the two weeks since it began collecting them. The Procurement Section of the committee has already transported and distributed them to various disaster areas, as reported previously. According to the personnel in charge of the Procurement Section, people from all walks of life, recognizing that autumn is approaching, the weather is cold and windy, and the victims have no clothes to protect themselves, have been even more enthusiastic about donating clothes since the 14th of this month. It is estimated that the total number of clothes received has reached over 100,000 pieces. Donations continue to arrive. Judging from this situation, there is no fear that 200,000 pieces of old clothing will not be obtained in the future. The Procurement Section is currently rushing to complete the procedures of disinfection and packaging, and they will be transported to the disaster areas for distribution soon.</p>

<p>The China-America Bank on Guangdong Road has not registered with the competent authorities according to the law. It is now rumored that it intends to issue high-interest dividend bonds to absorb funds from ordinary people. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, based on reports, has banned it. It is learned that the bureau's order to the company is as follows: "Order to comply. According to reports, the company has recently issued a type of non-convertible paper money called 'High-Interest Dividend Bonds,' with a total value of 250,000 yuan. Each bond is sold for one yuan and will be redeemed after five years. The bond, explanatory brochure, and articles of association have been forwarded. It has been found that merchants who operate savings businesses without being approved and registered, and who take advantage of social weaknesses to absorb small savings from ordinary people with high-interest rates and prize incentives, have been strictly banned by this bureau in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Industry. The company was previously ordered to register within a time limit but has not yet applied. Recently, it has re-issued High-Interest Dividend Bonds, which is inappropriate. It is ordered that the company immediately apply for registration and redeem all issued High-Interest Dividend Bonds within fifteen days, and submit a plan for closure for review and approval. This matter concerns social finance and must not be neglected, lest you incur guilt. This order is imperative."</p>

On the 10th of this month, an American from the foreign firm suddenly came and verbally declared that the house would be demolished and ordered me to move out within three days. According to the customs of the Shanghai Concession, landlords must give sufficient time for relocation and provide reasonable compensation if they need to take back the house. The landlord's procedures are incomplete, and the time limit is extremely urgent. I cannot move urgently. Yesterday (18th), the landlord sent people to build a fence, threatening to forcibly evict me. I am writing to your association to request that you write to the landlord to stop this and to the Public Works Department to protect me.' In response, we are writing to request that your department stop the landlord's direct action and not allow the spirit of the rule of law, as claimed by Judge Fei Tang, to be undermined."</p>

<p>In the case of lawyer Ren Zhennan, accused by Yong business owner Zhuang Chunfu of defrauding him of more than 5,000 yuan, the court held a hearing yesterday morning presided over by Judge Qian Chengjun. Ren Zhennan still claimed that there was nothing of the sort and that Zhuang sued him out of hatred because he was detained in the French police station. The plaintiff, Zhuang Li, testified in court that 1,500 yuan was paid at the China Hotel and 3,500 yuan was paid at the law firm, with Qian Yumin as a witness. Qian Yumin testified that Ms. Li did indeed pay at the China Hotel and at the law firm. After questioning him, Ren Zhennan said that Qian was a runner for lawyer Fei Xizhen and held a grudge against him due to jealousy over the case. The judge noted that Ren's clerk, Gu Gongda, had not yet been questioned, so he ordered that Gu Gongda be summoned to court for further questioning. Ren Zhennan was returned to custody.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government yesterday issued an instruction to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that: "An internal memo from the Ministry of Interior stated (omitted). In these times of national crisis, all Chinese people should endure hardship and share the burden of the nation. However, recent investigations have revealed that many young people in various places are still infatuated with dance halls, especially in Shanghai. If this continues, not only will national humiliation never be erased, but we will also become a laughingstock in the international community. We must strictly prohibit this to reverse this decline. Therefore, we specially request that your department instruct its subordinate agencies to strictly ban all existing dance halls and stop their operations. For those that have not yet opened, licenses should be revoked and openings prohibited. The public should also be earnestly advised to understand the importance of all Chinese people uniting and ceasing entertainment, stopping dancing, working hard, and resisting foreign forces (omitted)." The Social Affairs Bureau immediately instructed its subordinate agencies to strictly enforce the ban.</p>

<p>The Investigation Was Quite Laborious</p>
<p>No Formal Prosecution Yesterday</p>
<p>Three People Released on Bail</p>
<p>Zhang Xilin, the owner of the Ke Chongchang Silk Store at 147 Shandong Road, was kidnapped from the store on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month. Chief Inspector Zhang Zhiqin, detectives Geng Debiao, Kang Zengxiang, and detectives Huang Fusen and Xiao Shangpei of the General Patrol Room successively arrested Shi Zhongfu and others, and rescued Zhang Xilin from the Zhou family's residence on Lincoln Road in western Shanghai. During the firefight, West Deputy Inspector Mike Wailen was shot twice, and abductors Liu Jinhua and Jiang Weiliang were also seriously injured. Liu later died of his injuries, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police sent the arrested suspects Shi Zhongfu, Tian Chengxiang, Xu Agen, Miao Xingyuan, Qian Nanyun, Ding Dezhao, Yan Shaoshan, Yan Yu, Bao Liu, Jin Yuxiang, Jiang Huang, Xu Jianqing, Jiang Chenglin, Tang Yiqi, Wu Futai, Gu Hengshan, Zhang Donglin, Wang Xingcun, (Li Ming, a lawyer's assistant who works with Miao Xingyuan), Yao Junde, Cao Deyu, Wang Xiting, Gao Qingfu, Lu Pinyu, Gu Hengyu, Hong Jingshan, Xu Xifu, Lu Zhengzhi, Yu Xiaofang, Cao Zhanhong, and Yu Chen, a total of thirty people, to the First Special District Court's Criminal Court. Judge Xu Jiashi presided over the hearing. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the number of defendants in this case, including the injured Jiang Weiliang, was as high as thirty-one, and the investigation was quite laborious. The police have not yet fully investigated, so a formal prosecution cannot be made at this time. He requested that they be temporarily detained. Although the police knew that about ten people were not involved, if they were released, it would be impossible to arrest them again if they were later found to be suspects. Therefore, he could not request their release today. He would request their release from the court once it was determined that they were not involved. Chief Inspector Zhang Zhiqin then gave a detailed account of the case (see this newspaper's reports on the 14th and 15th). Zhang Xilin testified that Jiang Weiliang, Liu Jinhua, and Jin Yuxiang were his guards, and Jiang Huang was responsible for cooking. However, it was already dark when he was kidnapped, so he could not identify the abductors' faces. Shi Zhongfu confessed that Yan Shaoshan, Tian Chengxiang, Miao Xingyuan (also known as Xiao Yu), Jiang Chenglin, Xu Agen, and Qian Nanyun were involved in the crime. Fan Gang, the lawyer for Hong Jingshan, requested that his client be released on bail, arguing that Hong, along with his friends Wang Xiting and Cao Deyu, had been entrusted by Wang Xingcun to handle a debt collection case at the time of the arrest and had no involvement in the kidnapping case. He also presented sufficient proof. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Xu ordered that Hong Jingshan, Wang Xiting, and Cao Deyu be released on bail, while the remaining defendants were returned to custody. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<p>Accusation of Sun Longyi for Not Providing Compensation</p>
<p>If No Money is Given, Then Provide Eternal Support</p>
<p>Sun Longyi, a native of Jiangbei working as a carrier for a certain waste company, had a dispute with Sun Ankui (41 years old), a fellow villager and boatman, at the Shejing Road riverbank at 6:50 AM on the 16th of this month over waste collection. They grappled with each other, and Sun Ankui was kicked in the abdomen by Sun Longyi. He fell to the ground and cried for help. Hua Tanmu Zhou Kaiwen and Hua Bu No. 2702 of the Harbin Police Station rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and arrested Sun Longyi. The injured man was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment, while Sun Longyi was sent to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. Sun Ankui died from his injuries at 1:45 AM on the 18th. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the case and said that Sun Ankui's body had been examined by Prosecutor Guo of the court and confirmed that he died from his injuries. The police are charging the defendant with injury causing death under Article 296 of the Criminal Code and requested severe punishment. The deceased's wife, Sun Miao, testified that she saw the defendant beat her husband first, causing his death, and demanded justice. She added that she had a 65-year-old mother and a two-year-old daughter who depended on him for their livelihood. When questioned, the defendant stammered and denied his previous confession that he kicked the deceased in the abdomen, and hired a lawyer to argue that the deceased had epilepsy and was prone to death from minor injuries. The victim's family also hired a lawyer to defend them and demanded that the defendant pay for funeral expenses, coffin costs, and old-age pension, totaling 5,200 yuan. Although the defendant did not have this financial capacity, he was employed by the waste company, and the company should bear the responsibility. The deceased's mother, Sun Zhao, stated that the deceased did not have epilepsy during his lifetime and that she saw a large bruise on his chest and a dissection line on his abdomen at the mortuary. Sun Miao also stated that if the defendant was unwilling to pay the requested compensation, she, her young daughter, and her aunt would have him support them forever. Judge Shen had both sides' lawyers debate and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody for a scheduled verdict.</p>

<p>The ancient herbal manuscript in the Dunhuang Stone Chamber, originally named "Dietary Therapy Herbal," was written by Meng Xian of the Tang Dynasty and specifically discusses methods of nourishment to be offered to Empress Wu Zetian of the time. Meng studied under Sun Simiao and served in the palace, so his experience and knowledge were superior at the time. His "Dietary Therapy Herbal" was further annotated and revised by Zhang Zengbei and more than ten others, increasing its value. However, due to the chaos of the times, the original manuscript was lost and no longer existed, which was a misfortune for Chinese medicine. Unexpectedly, ancient books from the Tang Dynasty were found in the Dunhuang Stone Chamber in Gansu at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and the "Dietary Therapy Herbal" was among them. In 1907, British explorer Dr. Stein heard this news during an expedition in the Western Regions and tracked it down. He collected ancient books, loaded them up, and left, and they are now stored in the British Museum in London, so the Chinese people cannot see the "Dietary Therapy Herbal." Recently, a Chinese man, Zhang Hongming, managed to copy the original manuscript and return it to China for printing. It includes a title by Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Director of the Academia Sinica, and a preface by Mr. Zhao Yaonong, Director of the Chinese Medicine Research Department of the Academia Sinica. The book is bound together and priced at one yuan. It is sold at the Commercial Press and the Great East Book Company on Fourth Malu Road in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Bigamy, Abandonment, Abuse, and Other Crimes</p>
<p>Requesting Divorce and Alimony</p>
<p>Wang Ying, a woman from Yunnan, is twenty-three years old, beautiful, and has received a secondary education. In the spring of the 13th year of the Republic of China, Ms. He Xiuzhen, a classmate of Wang's mother, got married in her hometown and hired Pan Yishan, a fellow villager, as the wedding officiant. Wang served as the bridesmaid. Pan was then the Dean of Education at the Yunnan Military Academy and was thirty-eight years old. After an unexpected meeting with Wang, he took a liking to her. He entrusted a certain Mr. Liu, a brigade commander under Tang Jiyao, the former military governor of Yunnan, to propose to Wang's father. The proposal was accepted, and the wedding was held in the winter of that year, with Chief of Staff Shen as the officiant. The following year, Pan took Wang to live in Shanghai, renting a house at 93 Park Road in the Public Concession. For several years, the couple's relationship was close, and Pan held important positions in the military, such as Acting Garrison Commander of Wuhan, Commander of the Changsha Garrison, and Chief of Staff to Zhang Zongchang, etc. However, last spring, a rift appeared between them. Wang later discovered that he had secretly married another woman, which led to repeated abuse and abandonment of the family. Recently, she hired lawyer Li Ming to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing her husband Pan Yishan of bigamy, abandonment, and abuse, and requesting a divorce and alimony. The complaint stated that since marrying the defendant, the plaintiff's feelings were very deep. Last spring, the defendant went to the north alone, leaving the plaintiff in Shanghai for more than half a year. There was no news, and repeated inquiries were not answered, causing the plaintiff to be heavily in debt and almost everything mortgaged. Later, when the defendant returned to Shanghai, the plaintiff found a photo of the defendant and a young woman in his luggage. She immediately confronted him, but he became angry and violent. In August of this year, the defendant went to Qingdao, leaving the plaintiff in Shanghai, living in extreme poverty. Repeated requests for assistance were met with excuses, and the debt piled up. Now the defendant has returned to Shanghai from Qingdao, but he does not repay the debt and forces the plaintiff to go to Qingdao immediately, intending to harm her. When she argued with him, she was beaten. Recently, she found in the defendant's letter remarks such as "sent from Nanyang Road or Zhao's house," initially suspecting it was a relative, but later heard that the defendant had another wife and a daughter named Min, who is currently studying at Guanghua. Upon learning this, she was heartbroken. Since the plaintiff and defendant married seven years ago, she had hoped to grow old together, but the defendant acted against his conscience. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit, requesting that the defendant be summoned and punished according to the law, and ordered to pay RMB 4,000 for dowry and alimony. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xiefen of the Fifth Criminal Court summoned the case. The defendant did not appear, but the plaintiff, Ms. Wang Ying, and her lawyer arrived in court. After stating the reasons for the lawsuit, Judge Xiao announced that the case would be adjourned and served on the defendant, ordering him to appear in court.</p>

Shen Changgen, a Ningbo native, fifteen years old, lives with them. Shen and Zubei had a grudge over gambling, which led to frequent quarrels. At around 7 PM the other night, Zubei and Changgen had another argument over a trivial matter, which escalated into a conflict. Changgen could not resist and injured Zubei's head, causing blood to flow. At that time, Zheng Yougen, a relative of Changgen, happened to pass by and saw the situation. He immediately stepped forward and held Zubei's hands, making him unable to move. Changgen thought it was an opportunity and beat Zubei severely. Zubei's hands were held by Zheng, making him unable to resist. He was injured and fell to the ground, unconscious. His mother, Wang Hu, heard the news and rushed to the scene. She took Zubei to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the injuries were severe and his life may be in danger. In a state of panic, Wang rushed back and took Zheng Yougen and Shen Changgen to the police station of the First District to request punishment. The police chief ordered a preliminary hearing of the plaintiff and defendant. Because the case involved injury, he ordered that a document be prepared and sent to the Shanghai District Court for investigation.</p>

<p>(Not Selling Japanese Goods Results in Good Business Performance)</p>
<p>I am a small shop assistant at a counter. Seeing the repeated failures of the boycott of Japanese goods in the cloth industry, I was outraged and, after returning to the store from participating in the citizens' assembly, contacted my colleagues to voluntarily boycott them, which has yielded good results. I am very satisfied, so I am publishing the facts and asking my colleagues to voluntarily boycott them. I am a shop assistant working in a cloth store near the ancestral Chuan Cun Memorial Tower of the Rinan Yarn Factory in the western district. Since the violent Japanese forcibly occupied the Northeast, Japanese warships have been densely deployed in the Yangtze River basin, and the national situation is extremely dangerous. Appealing to justice has been unsuccessful, and relying on force is insufficient. The only thing we can rely on is the thorough boycott of Japanese goods by the Chinese people. However, from the May 9th, May 3rd, May 4th incidents to the Wanbaoshan Massacre, none of them are not deeply engraved in the hearts of the Chinese people, and after each tragedy, the Chinese people have to carry out an anti-Japanese movement. Originally, the violent Japanese plundered no less than 300 million yuan from our country every year to make up for their economic panic and help their unemployed workers. If the Chinese people, from top to bottom, were determined to boycott and persist to this day, the violent Japanese economic situation would definitely undergo major changes, and factory closures and increased unemployment would be expected. Unfortunately, the five-minute heat of the Chinese people has not arrived, and the clouds quickly dissipate, and the boycott results are only equal to zero. Even in my cloth industry, except for some western goods, 70% of the goods are enemy goods. Japanese merchants, seeing that our country has repeatedly boycotted them, have not been unaffected, and they have used many cunning schemes to impersonate western merchants, mixing imitation pearls with real ones to deceive the Chinese people. Ordinary cloth produced by our factories mostly uses 60-count and 42-count double-stranded yarn, which are mostly Japanese goods. Occasionally, one or two domestic yarn factories work hard to operate, but the supply cannot meet the demand, and the colors are inferior, so the weaving industry unanimously competes to purchase Japanese raw materials. It can be seen that the economic aggression of Japanese imperialism has been deeply rooted. Reading your newspaper's message from Mr. Fusheng, the counter staff in the cloth industry are restricted by the power of capitalists and cannot move freely, which affects their livelihoods. This is indeed a difficult question for more than 10,000 shop assistants in Shanghai to answer. Originally, ordinary shop assistants in the cloth industry do not have the same enthusiasm as school students for saving the country. Except for a few who pay attention, others are still the same as before, as if it has nothing to do with them. This has lost the national duty. If they continue to sell enemy goods and fool their compatriots for the benefit of capitalists, then they are truly willing to be cold-blooded animals. Therefore, at the beginning of the anti-Japanese movement, I myself swore that I would not sell enemy goods to my compatriots "such as enemy goods, floral plain contribution呢, satin, moon glory 羢, fine cloth···etc.," which are all major sales items in the cloth industry in winter. Customers cannot easily distinguish them. If they insist on cutting a certain kind of cloth, it is difficult for the shop assistants to deal with it. I point out that this is enemy goods and advise them to buy domestic goods. At first, the capitalists and colleagues ridiculed me, but I argued that everyone knows about the boycott of enemy goods this time, so I went a step further to discuss voluntarily sealing them up and declared that we would not buy or sell them. (1) It can enhance the credibility of the store, (2) It can gain the trust of customers. I repeatedly persuaded and discussed with the capitalists and shop assistants in detail, and finally it was passed. Unexpectedly, since the implementation, in less than half a month, the business has become more prosperous. Now both labor and capital are very satisfied, but it also relies on the propaganda of schools and news organizations to make it easier for customers to persuade them to buy domestic goods. Overall, if my cloth industry does not import Japanese goods, it will not necessarily close down. Now there are many cloth industries in Shanghai and other major commercial ports that have voluntarily boycotted or established anti-Japanese associations to seal them up. However, colleagues in inland towns and villages have not thoroughly understood and secretly smuggle and repackage them in parcels, destroying anti-Japanese work. Are they willing to be slaves of a fallen country? Enthusiastic shop assistant comrades, you have encountered difficulties at the counter, of course, are the same. Who is willing to lag behind in loving the country? I urge everyone to inspire their conscience, follow my suggestion, enlighten the public, be bold, and never use Japanese goods. My cloth industry will never close down. Boycott them quickly!</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Voice of Resistance</p>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>Japan was originally called the Wanu (dwarf) Kingdom. It changed to its current name at the beginning of the Xianheng period of the Tang Dynasty. During the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty, Japan sent an envoy, Hali Maha, to submit a memorial and make purchases. Emperor Taizu asked about their national customs. Hali was arrogant and conceited, and presented a five-character律 poem: "Our country is like the Central Plains, our people are like the ancients. Our clothing follows the Tang system, our rites and music follow the Han dynasty. Silver urns hold clear wine, golden knives slice plain carp. Every year in February and March, peach and plum blossoms bloom naturally." Emperor Taizu hated his rudeness, rebuked his absurdity, and rejected his tribute to show his abandonment. In recent decades, Japan has been violent and reckless, repeatedly invading our country. Its cruelty and evil are unacceptable to reason and humanity. There is a Cantonese saying: "A man is not four feet tall, but hides a knife in his belly." Now, looking at the violent acts of the Japanese dwarfs, I believe it even more. However, those who commit many injustices will inevitably destroy themselves. This is what history tells us. Will the Japanese dwarfs realize this?</p>

<p>In the winter of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, a group of older children worked in Kaifeng, which could also be said to be playing. Because they found joy in their work and significance in their play. One day was Mrs. Cha Mianzhong's birthday, and Zou Bingwen suggested a new way to celebrate her birthday. This new method was to put the wife's photo in the quilt overnight. Mianzhong said, "I didn't bring a photo, what can I do?" Bingwen said, "Then writing her name will also work." Whether Mianzhong did this is unknown. But this kind of innocent life is worth appreciating.</p>
<p>Now Mianzhong is helping with the flood relief, suffering with the hungry and drowning, and unable to rest. Bingwen is in charge of judicial administration and is concerned with agricultural research. They are now adults with many thoughts. In their spare time, recalling the children's games of the past can reduce their worries. Good, let us revive as children together!</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Old Trick of Annexing Korea <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Jie</p>
<p>Korea was a dependency of our country. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Toyotomi Hideyoshi of Japan claimed to be guarding the country and invaded the Korean capital. The Koreans hated him. When Daewongun was in power, he burned the Japanese embassy. Japan accused him and demanded 500,000 yuan in compensation and permission to build a military guard embassy. At that time, the Korean officials were divided into two factions. One faction, led by Min Young-ik and Min Young-jun, advocated relying on China and adhering to the principle of serving the great. The other faction, led by Hong Young-sik and Kim Ok-gyun, advocated relying on Japan and pursuing independence and reform. They attacked each other, causing internal strife. This allowed Japan to reap the benefits. In 1894 (the twentieth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty), the Donghak Party rebelled in the country. Japan used the pretext of protecting merchants and sent troops to Korea. The Korean king sent an envoy to the Qing court to request troops. The Qing court ordered Admiral Ye Zhichao and Nie Shicheng to lead troops to Asan. When the Donghak Party saw the arrival of the Chinese and Japanese troops, they dispersed. Thus, the internal problem of Korea became an international negotiation between China and Japan. After Japan defeated Russia, it made Korea a protectorate. According to the agreed terms, Japan was allowed to station troops in Korea and establish military police. The Japanese envoy Ito Hirobumi forced the Korean king to abandon his diplomatic powers and established a protectorate in the Korean capital, establishing branch offices in each province and placing police at the gates of the Korean imperial palace to monitor the comings and goings of his ministers. The Korean emperor was very angry and secretly sent Lee Sang-seol, Lee Wee-jong, and Lee Joon as representatives to the International Peace Conference in The Hague to complain. The International Peace Conference refused to consider the proposal. The secret envoys returned discouraged. They also secretly appealed to the US government, but were refused a meeting. Several days later, someone using an American name sent a telegram to major newspapers in various countries stating that the Korean emperor was now imprisoned by the Japanese police, almost like a prisoner. The Japanese were furious and forced the Korean emperor to abdicate. Korean officials, gentry, men, women, old and young, were all indignant and excited, like drunkards and madmen. A movement to boycott Japan arose. Rallies were held and speeches were given daily in the area around Zhonglu Cheondong outside the West Gate of Seoul. There were so-called Security Association, Independence Association, National Revival Association, One Heart Association, etc., which called upon members everywhere to grind their teeth, tear their eyes, pant, and run about. Some cut telegraph lines, some destroyed railways, some committed suicide, and some formed secret societies, but all were to no avail. Only Ahn Jung-geun's assassination in Harbin was somewhat gratifying, but Korea was ultimately lost to Japan. Alas, the frequent internal strife in our country today is like the factional disputes in Korea. Japan's invasion of the eastern provinces is like the invasion of Korea in the past. The unreliability of the League of Nations is like the unreliability of the International Peace Conference. The boiling public anger is like that of the Koreans in those days. Japan is using its old trick of destroying Korea. Will our country follow in the footsteps of the Three Hans? I am narrating the story of Korea's fall. I have no time to be sad for the Koreans. Alas.</p>

<p>Sound Films in Court</p>
<p>Although sound films can only be used for entertainment, since the invention of sound films, they have been very helpful in practical applications. Now they are being used in court. Recently, in the Supreme Court of Melbourne, Australia, there was a lawsuit in which someone complained that the noise of a milk farm was disturbing the neighbors and asked the court to stop it. A sound film was presented to the court as evidence. The film recorded the sounds of the milk farm. After viewing the film, the judge found the complaint to be true and accepted the case. The plaintiff won the case. In the UK, sound films are often used in lawsuits related to sound. The Australian milk farm case has aroused the interest of British lawyers. It is expected that sound films will be used as evidence in other countries' lawsuits when necessary.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a tragic death occurred in the UK. A person died unexpectedly while filming. At that time, the camera happened to be working and completely captured his death. The film company presented the film to the court, which relieved them of legal liability. However, that was a silent film.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Lament for the Northeast <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Ever since the Japanese army forcibly occupied the Northeast, the education sector has unanimously advocated inserting texts about the Japanese devastation of the Northeast into textbooks to awaken the youth. Yesterday, I received a letter from Yun'er, stating that Mr. Gong Ziyang, a history and geography teacher at Suzhou Middle School, recently composed "Lament for the Northeast," a piece of writing filled with grief. The school has adopted it as teaching material and is passing it on to the students. Therefore, I am transcribing the original text as follows:</p>
<p>Look at the Northeast, the atmosphere is filled with enemy forces. They indulge in greed and plunder, causing us worry and pain. They drove straight into the three provinces, sweeping across thousands of miles. The world is like this, where is justice to be found? What crime have we committed? They damaged their railway. The matter is trivial, but the situation is more wrong. One envoy had not communicated yet, and three armies were already deployed. Their hearts are those of tigers and wolves, harboring such intentions all along. The towering Zhang family, the pillar of the nation. The navy had giant ships, and the army was elite on land. Yet they did not focus on border affairs, instead engaging in internal strife. How could they suddenly let the enemy run rampant? It was said that there were international bodies that could be sought for intervention. To lose our pillar of the nation, with a single dispatch. It was thought national difficulties could be eased and the enemy's situation could be intimidated. How did this matter end? Heavy troops have been holding it for a long time. Since the defeat of our army, the people are terrified. Like stray dogs, like lost sheep. Mountains and rivers change color, the sun and moon lose their light. A great mistake has been made, how can it be remedied? The towering Shenyang, the former residence of emperors. Tall pavilions with three levels, wide streets open in all directions. Scholars and women are stranded in vain, wealth and goods are piled up like mountains. Overnight, banners and flags have changed. Swift as wind and lightning, sweeping across the entire Liaoning. Loss and destruction have a date, but when will restoration come? Mr. Li is in a tight spot, Su Wu's spirit has vanished. They temporarily remove their old clothes and pay homage to the new dynasty together. Border offices and provincial governments, the lives of the people are entrusted to them. What do they worry about, what do they scheme? Some flee, some are arrested. Joyful entertainment is hard to forget, but hardship and danger are ignored. The great rivers and mountains are entrusted to these children. Radio towers stand tall, airplanes soar. The stone archives are rich in books, and the Orchid Gears are equipped with good machines. Moving east and hiding west, with a hundred holes and a thousand sores. Working as a wedding dress for others, a fleeting spring dream. Railways are the lifeline of a nation. Once they benefited our travel, but now they serve the enemy's service. The poisonous flames spread further, and the national crisis becomes more severe. Millions of money, better to waste it in vain. Soon we will see outside the customs, where colonies are established wherever they go, taking our country's land and filling their family treasures. The avenues are filled with carriages and the road is paved, officials wear new clothes. They swagger through the city, with the majesty of gods. All sources of profit are occupied, and industry and commerce are driven away. No Manchus, no Han Chinese, wear similar clothing. The economy gradually weakens, and livelihoods are strained. Those who are fortunate enough to survive will forever be servants. Alas, how sad!</p>

<p>— Liu Henwo, sent from Guangzhou</p>
<p>For years, I have been wandering north and south, weathered and weary. However, wherever I have traveled, I have left my footprints on famous scenic spots and historical sites. At the beginning of this summer, I returned south as a guest and resumed my work with pen and ink at the Yuehan Railway Bureau, burying myself in paperwork. Three months passed in vain. During the Double Tenth holiday, my colleagues proposed a trip to Qingyuan to see the Flying Xia Cave and Hiding Xia Cave, as well as the various scenic spots of Flying Come Temple. They asked for my opinion, and I happily agreed. That morning, at eight o'clock, a special train was attached to the second train and departed from Huangsha. There were more than twenty people traveling together, many with their spouses. Joking and laughing</p>

<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>The Oriental Cultural Society, organized and established in Paris by scholars from various countries in the Far East and Near East, has only seven years of history. However, the number of member countries has reached fifteen. The members who join are all people who have made considerable contributions in academics. It is not open to just anyone. The purpose of this association is: (1) to collect historical materials from various Eastern countries; (2) to examine and verify antiquities from various Eastern countries; (3) to study the different schools of thought in Eastern culture (such as language, art, religion, philosophy, etc.). After seven years of effort by members from various countries, it has achieved considerable results. Chinese members are the majority in this association. The first</p>
<p>President is also a Chinese member, Mr. Li Weihou. The mission he bears in Eastern academics and politics is very significant. Especially for the future of our nation and culture, he has a particularly significant influence. I attended a tea party of this association the day before yesterday and listened to the great theories of the scholars and the discussions on the progress of the association's affairs. I feel that its future contribution to Chinese academics and politics can be predicted to be extraordinary.</p>
<p>During the tea party, Mr. Liu Haisu, who had just returned from Europe after studying art, also gave a lengthy speech. He said that we are all muddleheaded in our own country. Once we arrive in Europe, we realize the brilliance of our ancient Chinese academics. We ourselves will not revive or promote them, but we let others absorb and explore them. In reality, we are deteriorating day by day, while others are making rapid progress. For example, in terms of art, Japan has taken some of our leftovers and pure Chinese paintings to Europe for exhibitions, expanding publicity and claiming them as national essence and representative works of Eastern art. Therefore, unless people who have studied Eastern art, the general public only knows that there is Japanese art in the East, but does not know that there is Chinese art.</p>
<p>He said that in recent years, various German states and universities have attached great importance to ancient Chinese academics, much more than we value Western academics. All universities have established Chinese academies dedicated to the study of Chinese culture throughout the ages. Chinese philosophy, literature, art, and various classics have been collected very comprehensively. Even Lao Tzu, Zhuang Tzu, Mo Tzu, Lie Zi, and the Confucian and Mencian doctrines have complete translations. This shows a glimpse of their research spirit. Universities are very welcoming of Chinese scholars to give lectures. However, the number of Chinese scholars who actually go to study and lecture is extremely rare. In mid-March of this year, when Mr. Liu arrived at the University of Frankfurt, the director of the Chinese Academy invited him to give lectures for three days. The first topic was "The Six Laws of Chinese Painting." When talking about the four words "Qi Yun Sheng Dong" (spiritual consonance), he gave the following explanation. Arrogantly, no longer suffering loneliness. I was alone on a journey, and scenes evoked my emotions. Leaning against the carriage, I silently recited Jiang Baishi's "South to North, What Is the Matter? Rippling Xiang Cloud Chu Water, My Eyes Are Heartbroken." I could not help but feel emotional. Fortunately, the journey was not far. At eleven o'clock, we arrived at the Pajiangkou Station. After getting off the train, we walked for about a mile to the riverbank. Lei Duan had hired a motorboat to wait and lead us. The crowd gathered, set sail, and advanced against the waves. We first went to Hidden Xia Cave. Climbing up winding cloud ladders and stone paths, the stream water was clear and gurgling. The temple was planted with flowers, red and purple and fragrant. Behind the mountain, there was a stubborn stone on which the words "Imperial Seal" were written. It is said to have been a stone seal left by Qianlong, but it is a false rumor and laughable. Turning west, we went to Flying Xia Cave. The magnificent palaces and halls were extremely grand. Twin peaks stand facing each other, forming lions and elephants. A magnificent spectacle. Behind the cave, there is a Phoenix Tower. In the evening twilight and the morning sun, the view from the railing is extremely beautiful. The person in charge here greeted us warmly and offered vegetarian meals to the guests. The vegetables were delicious and tasted better than home-cooked food. In the evening, we stayed in a small pavilion. The sound of the wind and waves vaguely entered our ears. I fell into a dream and felt like an immortal. The next day, I woke up at dawn and leaned on the railing to watch the sunrise. The morning clouds had not yet dispersed, and the morning sun was rising. The rays of light were colorful, making it impossible to look directly at them. After retreating and finishing breakfast, we bid farewell and went down the mountain. Walking slowly, there was still a lingering attachment. We still took a boat to Flying Come Temple. The temple was originally named Guangqing and is located in Yuxia in the upper reaches of Qingyuan. The mountains surround it, the river flows quietly, and the waves and sails are like entering a natural painting. Looking around, we washed away ten thousand loads of dust. Behind the temple, there is a flying spring hanging down like a white silk, making a slight sound as it hits the rocks. A Flying Spring Pavilion is built next to it. Looking up and listening to the waterfall, we could not bear to leave quickly. Celebrities such as Li Yinquan, Chen Shuren, and Pan Wenzhi often gathered with friends and lingered, forgetting to return. It is known that it is not a false name and has something particularly attractive. On the top of the mountain, there is also the Emperor's Shrine, the Reading Rock, the Returning Ape Cave, the Joy Rain Pavilion, and the Golden Lock Pool. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we could not fully enjoy them. We will leave it for another day.</p>

<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>A gentle and pleasant wind blew towards us, interrupting Tao Chi's conversation! Looking up, we saw a large garden in front of us, with five large golden characters shimmering in the morning light – "Modern Paradise".</p>
<p>The three people's eloquence subsided, and they only proceeded towards this modern paradise. They couldn't remember many of the "Park Rules" posted at the entrance of the paradise, one on the left and one on the right. The most noteworthy rule was that it overturned the fallacy of "time flies like a river" and implemented a method to make youth eternal. People who entered it had no past and no future, only the present, only the everlasting and unchanging present.</p>
<p>The three people were attracted by the appeal of these park rules and couldn't help but enter this modern paradise without a past or future. The gentle and pleasant wind continued to blow, and the men and women in the park shuttled back and forth like weavers, their faces filled with smiles.</p>
<p>Tao Chi looked back at his companions, Zhao Meiting and Qian Lanxuan, but he didn't know when they had been separated. He didn't feel the loneliness of walking alone, because everywhere in this garden were his companions.</p>
<p>The chirping of the beautiful birds was so clear and crisp, and the rare flowers and exotic grasses were so fragrant and beautiful. The morning light was shining on the highest branch of the peach blossoms, which were just half-bloomed. The flower branch was reflected in a small pool of clear water, and the goldfish in the pool were playing with the flower shadows at the bottom of the water.</p>
<p>A soft singing voice was being sung in the pavilion. Looking from afar, they were all beautiful young women singing modern new songs. The alluring tones unknowingly intoxicated Tao Chi's spirit -</p>
<p>– Modern New Songs –</p>
<p>The Washington Conference is a barrier to peace;</p>
<p>The disarmament treaty is equivalent to abolishing war!</p>
<p>Moreover, there is also the League of Nations, the League of Nations,</p>
<p>The term "the strong eat the weak" will never apply in the twentieth century!</p>
<p>Compatriots! Don't worry, don't fret!</p>
<p>Here there are singing birds and fragrant flowers, here there is a gentle breeze and a beautiful sun;</p>
<p>Let us rejoice! Let us play!</p>

<h3 id="e172">Financial Gold Standard Strongly Rebounds <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the benchmark gold price rebounded strongly to a high of nineteen taels and four mace. The price rose slightly in the morning session and was particularly strong in the afternoon session. However, the fluctuating prices between eighteen and nineteen taels made people's sentiment turn from weak to bullish. Afterwards, the price surged to nearly twenty taels. This was a reverse move after several days of declines. However, it is difficult to predict changes in the market. Although the silver market rose, it was not affected. The supply exceeded the demand abroad, so the opening price immediately broke through 690 taels. Later, it was rumored that Canada planned to ban the export of cash, which led to a setback. However, the foreign exchange rate remained stable and rose in the afternoon session. The market suddenly rose sharply in the afternoon session, breaking through 700 taels, a sharp increase of more than ten taels. This was due to foreign news that the violent Japanese troops in the Northeast had withdrawn, which aroused people's enthusiasm and led to a surge in buying, with bills of exchange following suit. Short sellers were eager to cover their positions and were greatly stimulated. The situation was the opposite of the previous day.</p>
<p>The morning market was still fluctuating. The opening price in the early morning rose by three taels and two mace, totaling 691 taels and five mace. The price of large bars only rose by one-sixteenth, and the price of silver rose by one-quarter. Citibank continued to sell. As sales seemed to increase, the price retreated to 89 taels and five mace. However, with people's bullish sentiment, Zhifeng Yongde, He Hongkang Yongyuan Cheng Yong, and others rushed to buy, and the price rose again, frequently rising by five or six taels, with fluctuations of only one or two taels. The initial exchange rate for US dollars was 32 yuan and 75 fen, then 62 fen and 5 li, and finally 95 li and 5 qian at around 9:20. When the exchange rate for British gold was announced, it was around 94 taels, and the listed price only added 25 fen for US dollars, which caused exchange rate squeezing. Then it retreated to 93 taels. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of two taels above and below each other. Later, because British gold was transacted at 181.25, the transactions on the surface were complicated. At 10 o'clock, there seemed to be many buyers, breaking through two taels. At 10:30, it was 95 taels. Suddenly, the news that Canada had temporarily suspended the gold standard caused people's sentiment to fall, and the price fell by five taels. Colleagues such as Yuan Maoyong Tong, Taichang, Dadecheng, Fuyu Shunli, and Mr. Wu sold off. At 11:30, it was 90 taels. Afterwards, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and the buying and selling of various firms varied, resulting in a fluctuation of one or two taels. After 11:40, Yuan Chun and others bought in, so the price rose by three taels, to 94 taels and two qian. However, Hengchang Yong and others sold off. At the close of the market, it was 92 taels and eight qian, and then it rose again to four qian. In short, people's sentiment was uncertain. The announced price was changed to more than 740 taels, with a range of 53-54 taels to 57-58 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon market moved forward steadily. The opening price in the afternoon was 94 taels and five qian, then from five taels to four taels. When Cuichang Yongdadecheng Hengchang Yong and others bought in, the price was increased by three taels, to 97 taels. Yuan Maoyong Dadecheng came to sell. At 2:20, it was five taels and three qian. Later, because the foreign exchange market strengthened, HSBC first issued British gold for December at 180.625. Then, the Wheat Bank and others issued 180. Suddenly, the news that Japan was withdrawing troops aroused people's enthusiasm. Daxing Yongfu Yu, Dadecheng Zhifeng Yongqian Changxiang, and others were very eager to buy, and British gold was particularly strong, only 179.375 to 875, a sharp increase of seven taels. At 3:15, the price exceeded the 700 taels mark, to 02 taels and six qian. Yuan Kangxiang Dadecheng sold out and retreated to 700 taels and nine qian. The market was even stronger, with a thriving atmosphere. Zhifeng Yong Yuan Maoyong Nei Xing Qian Changxiang and various firms did not make efforts to compete, because British gold was selling at 178.75. If the settlement was only 177.8125 to 75, banks exchanged US dollars at 32 yuan and 4375. Then, 25 were available for sale, and the gold price had risen by more than seven taels. At 4:20, it reached a high of 08 taels. At 4:30, the closing price was 07 taels and seven qian, an increase of 19 taels and four mace compared to the previous evening. After the closing bell, the price was made to 08 taels again. However, Dalian Gang and Yifeng sold out, and the price was reduced by two taels, to 07 taels. The maximum price for the day was 708 taels, and the minimum was 689 taels and five qian, a total range of 18 taels and five qian. Looking back, the price of goods was 91 taels and five qian in the morning, 94 taels at noon, 94 taels in the afternoon, and 707 taels at the close of the market. The announced price was 40 taels, and the deposit water was 93 taels in the morning and 708 taels in the afternoon. The red bar was increased by twelve taels.</p>
<p>Transactions seeking to exceed supply, there were complex transactions on the surface. Statistics showed that supply was less than demand. Zhifeng Yong, Yuan Chengyong, Qian Changxiang, Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanchun, Futaiheng, Hengxing, Yifeng, and Hongkang Yong all bought, while Tong Taichang, Dadecheng, Yuan Maoyong, and Yuan Dayong all sold. There were more entries than exits. Yuantai, Daxing Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Senchang Yong, and Taifengcheng had complicated entries and exits. Cuichang Yong, Yifeng Yong, and Hengchang Yong Fu Yu all exited. In the afternoon, Hongkang Yong, Daxing Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Yongfeng, Bingxing, Cuichang Yong, Fu Yu, and Qian Changxiang all entered. Wanxing, Yuantai, and Hengxing Yong had irregular entries and exits. Dadecheng, Yuan Maoyong, and Hengchang Yong had the most active entries and exits. Tong Taichang, Futaiheng, Shunli, Yifeng, Yuan Kangxiang, and Yifeng Yong all exited. Those who hedged bills of exchange had entries and exits. However, the unified settlement of British gold was sold, and US dollars were sold by Dalian Gang after being bought. A total of 1500 to 1600 bars were cleared throughout the day. Guangbang sold 700 to 800 bars and bought 300 to 400 bars. Speculator Mr. Wu entered and exited.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Foreign Exchange Rate Trend Bullish <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver markets in England, America, and India all rose, but the market was flat, with more sellers than buyers. The exchange rate also rose. As for the Shanghai market, it was the opposite. HSBC's listed price changed slightly. The rates for British and Indian currencies did not change, but the US dollar increased by 25 fen, totaling 32 yuan and 25 fen. The French franc increased by five yuan, the German exchange rate increased by two marks, and foreign coins increased by half a shield. Hong Kong dollars increased by 25 fen, totaling 78 taels. The domestic market rose initially, then remained stable. The afternoon market was particularly tight. The gold market suddenly saw a rise, breaking through 700 taels. There were rumors that Japan was withdrawing troops, which aroused people's enthusiasm. As a result, the British gold rate decreased by 4375 compared to the previous day, and the US dollar decreased by 6875. The situation was unusually bullish, which was really unbelievable. Chinese merchants traded without hesitation, but it was not very enthusiastic. About 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded, mostly for settlement. 300,000 to 400,000 US dollars were traded, with Guangbang Shengda and others buying vigorously. However, various firms also sold out, and banks had entries and exits. Approximately one US dollar was equal to 3 taels, 1 qian and 0077.</p>
<p>There was a difference of 375 in the domestic British exchange rate throughout the day. The asking price in the morning was 1 shilling and 8 pence 125, and the buying price was 1875. Huabi issued 125 for December, and Dehua sold 125 for November to Shanghai Zhejiang and Korea. Huabi Mitsui issued 0625 for December, and Sumitomo and Andada exchanged 0625 for February. The asking price for Qian Shou was 8 pence 0625, and the buying price was 125. In the afternoon, HSBC issued 0625 for December, and then issued 8 pence for December 1. HSBC and Wheat Bank issued 8 pence for January. Pang Gen issued 179.375, Zhejiang entered 875, and the closing price was 17.75, and the buying price was 17.8125. The loosest was 18.125, and the tightest was 17.75. This was the price sold by the bank.</p>
<p>The domestic US exchange rate had a range of 625. The asking price in the early market was 32 yuan and 75 fen, and the buying price was 32 yuan and 875 fen. HSBC issued 75 for December and 625 for February (Shengda entered). Afterwards, they entered 8125 for January, and Zhengjin issued Mitsubishi to mutually exchange 75 for February. The asking price at noon was 625, and the buying price was 75. In the afternoon, Zhejiang absorbed 32 yuan and a half for January, and Huabi and Mitsui mutually exchanged 4375. The closing asking price was 32 yuan and 125 fen, and the buying price was 25. The loosest bank asking price was 32 yuan and 75 fen, and the tightest was 32 yuan and 25 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Overseas Silver Market Continues to Rise <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Exchange rate also rises</p>
<p>According to London telecommunications yesterday, the recent silver bar slightly increased by 0625, to 17 pence and 625. The forward price remained at 17 pence and 75. There were few sales in China, and India slightly purchased. Buyers were satisfied, and the market was stable after the close. The American quotation tended to sell.

<p>Market overview, due to various relations in recent days and various commercial stimulations, the financial community is under great pressure with silver shortage. The authorities have tried their best to provide assistance, so it seemed slightly calm for the past few days. However, in the most recent two or three days, an emergency scene reappeared before our eyes, and it was even more serious. According to industry insiders, if the silver shortage cannot be reversed, it will have a great impact on various financial difficulties, which is very worrying. Discounted interest rate, the "foreign discounted interest rate" in the early market fell slightly by one li, to 7 qian, 2 fen and 7 li. The noon market was slightly better by 2 hao and a half, to 7 qian, 2 fen and 7 li and 2 hao and a half. The "silver discount" in the early market actually returned to the high price of 4 qian, and the situation was very tense. The noon market was slightly suppressed by 5 fen, totaling 3 qian and 5 fen. The markup water also rose to 4 qian, and the minimum was also 3 qian, 1 fen and 2 hao. The bank's listing price increased to 1 qian and 6 fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary coin market conditions, the Jiangnan small silver coin saw another increase in li Xu, with both markets at 6 qian, 5 fen, 8 li and 7 hao and a half, an increase of 1 li and 2 hao and a half compared to the noon market the previous day.

<h3 id="e176">Customs Revenue Fell by Nearly Two Yuan This Year <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>In 1920, a decline of over one yuan was also seen.</p>
<p>Other fluctuations mostly balanced out, with only minor ups and downs.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for various public bonds: no spot transactions occurred in the morning, but the after-market saw increased trading in futures, generally performing well. Trading in November futures has gradually become more active, mainly because the exchange does not require margin deposits for arbitrage sellers, thus encouraging arbitrage trading. Consequently, there's been considerable arbitrage activity. Regarding changes in bond prices, the diplomatic situation remains as chaotic as before. Although the League of Nations has resolved that Japan should withdraw its troops first, Japan is still delaying and resisting, opposing interference from third parties. Whether there will be further complications in the future is difficult to predict. Fortunately, domestic peace and unification are nearing realization, so market sentiment is generally stable. When bond prices opened in the early morning, many briefly rose slightly compared to the previous day. Later, sellers became more active, causing all prices to gradually weaken. However, the fluctuations in consolidated tax, salt tax, and customs duties were very small before and after the market. The result was a larger drop compared to the previous day, with the 20th Customs next month's term and the 19th Good October term falling by one yuan and eighty-nine cents. The 19th Customs Opening 20th Roll, etc., also fell by about one yuan, while other changes were not significant. There were still alternating ups and downs compared to the previous day, such as the next month's futures for demobilization and troop reduction, which rose quite significantly. Although the overall trend in the securities market is still good, it is still difficult to grasp the trend and will depend on the evolution of the diplomatic situation. The total spot trading amounted to 23,000 yuan, with futures trading at over 6.6 million in the morning and about 2.6 million in the after-market, totaling 9.205 million yuan. Among them, consolidated tax accounted for over 2 million, which was the highest. The 20th Customs salt tax also performed well. In addition, the total trading volume of various bond November futures was over 900,000 yuan. The following table shows the opening and closing prices of each bond, compared to the previous day's trading volume:</p>

<p>The yarn market is constrained by the environment.</p>
<p>The yarn market has turned downwards, with a severe situation, due to the unfavorable overall environment, numerous rumors about the current situation, and tight monetary conditions. Sales of 10-count coarse yarn are sluggish, leading to weak market sentiment and a lack of buyers, causing the market to fall. The actual selling prices are too high, causing some stagnation among customers. Therefore, the overall situation is calm, with no major fluctuations.</p>
<p>Human mark retracement drops in both foreign exchanges. The Human mark exchange opened in the morning with a lack of buyers in the market and a relaxed market atmosphere, with each month falling by 1, 2, and 4 cents. The afternoon market continued to fall by 3, 4, 5, and 6 cents. The total trading volume was 24,900 bales. Sales included 750 bales from Dafu, 1,000 bales from Yuantai, 1,950 bales from Yiyu, and 2,000 bales from Taixing. Purchases included 1,700 bales from Yichang, 1,005 bales from Yicheng, and 850 bales from Shenchang. The closing prices of the Human mark exchange are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Human Mark Closing Prices and Inventory Quantities Human Mark Closing Prices and Inventory Quantities</p>

<p>December 164.7, 15, 98, 900 March 159.9, 14, 64, 150</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Turn Weak Spot yarn sales are average. Daily statistics show that various firms purchased a total of 1,000 bales. Transactions between firms totaled 360 bales, with average prices. Customer firms imported 230 bales from the mainland, 65 bales from Shantou, 415 bales from Guangdong, 175 bales from Jiangxi, and 100 bales from various firms.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Cotton Market Situation Remains Strong <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>American cotton continues to rise, but local cotton is flat and weak, as the base price is 5 to 6 taels higher than foreign cotton. Therefore, although foreign cotton has turned upwards, silver prices have increased. The current spot price for Middling cotton is equivalent to about 27.9 taels of standard silver. As a result, Shenxin Factory is purchasing large quantities of Indian and American cotton daily, about 20,000 pieces, at lower prices. Therefore, the higher the market price, the fewer buyers there are, and speculative dealers continue to sell when prices are high. However, Han firms are still inclined to go long due to poor harvests. For the time being, the market can still stand firm due to rising American cotton prices.</p>
<p>The Han mark rises, and the momentum has not weakened. The Han mark exchange opened in the morning due to rising American cotton prices, leading to a tighter market atmosphere, with prices rising by 3 to 4 cents in each month. During the second and third sessions, prices fell again due to a lack of buyers, resulting in an increase of 0.5 to 2 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that there was a lot of trading in foreign cotton, and the market fell again by 0.5 to 2 cents. The total trading volume was 75,300 dan. Sales included 2,200 dan from Yiyu, 2,200 dan from Yifeng, 1,800 dan from Xinheng, 1,800 dan from Mingde, and 1,100 dan from Ruidai. Purchases included 3,800 dan from Dachang, 2,100 dan from Yuanda, 1,900 dan from Gengfeng, and 2,200 dan from Houfengchang. The closing prices of the Han mark exchange are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton rose sharply due to purchases by peers and better spot demand, with active buyers and a firm market. Futures rose by 24 to 30 points, while spot prices rose by 25 points. British cotton futures rose by 6 to 7 points, while spot prices rose by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton was firm due to short covering and purchases by European exporters, with Bengal and Broach rising by 4 rupees, and Oomra rising by 4.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 19th):</p>

<p>Grain: River Rice Market Loosens, a Few Cents Drop</p>
<p>Yesterday, about 30 rice boats from various firms arrived in Nantou. The local market appetite was extremely weak, and the prices of both new and second-grade rice fell by nearly a few cents. Buyers were very quiet, and market sentiment was bearish, which also affected customer firms. Although the arrival of kiln-grown wild rice was small, the price also softened. New and old Du Yang pointed rice remained stagnant, with a slight decrease of 5 cents. Baige white rice secretly fell, changing by 2 yuan without honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market in Xin Zha had very few people in the morning. Changxi and Putong japonica rice were lower by a dime. The route for Xuxing and Su Tong new japonica rice was even more scarce, with prices loosening by a dime. Qingjiao kiln rice and Guashu rice arrived and sales were even, with no price changes. Foreign rice appetites were unhealthy and the market was flat. There was no transaction at the Baiyuan tea food store, and prices tended to weaken. The trend for broken hull goods was declining. Yesterday, Taikoo Company shipped 20,000 bags of foreign rice stacked in foreign warehouses.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Suspension of Northern Sales of Foreign Rice <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market was slightly sluggish because the Northern Ocean agency temporarily stopped handling shipments. Only local sales continued, and because transactions were few, prices were slightly lower. However, the Northern Ocean agency still had an appetite, and once shipments resumed, the market would immediately turn around. The Tong Market opened with 150 bags of Taizhou white rice at 9 yuan and 90 cents, 200 bags of Annam japonica rice at 12 yuan, and 100 bags of Min Dang rice at 10 yuan and 80 cents. A small number of imported rice from Japanese ships totaled 200 bags at 10 yuan and 40 cents, and another 200 tons from Japanese ships for March delivery at 5 taels, 3 maces, and 3 cents. All of these were received by local shops.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Flour Market Shows Signs of Gradual Increase <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>After opening in the morning and afternoon yesterday, the flour market showed signs of gradual increase in various months. This was due to foreign wheat quotations being 20 to 30 cents higher. Therefore, market sentiment was quite stable. Based on the latest foreign wheat quotations, or perhaps the overseas market had revitalized, most people believed there was a slight foothold, and buying sentiment was good. However, most domestic long positions were deeply affected and did not dare to act, and sales to the north remained dull. For the time being, the foreign wheat price comparison was still unable to inspire market enthusiasm. As a result, this month was 1 cent and 2.5 li better than the previous day, November was 1 cent better, and December to March were all 1 cent and 5 li better.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Stabilized Situation in Wheat Futures <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market showed a slightly stabilized situation in various months after opening in the morning and afternoon. Due to foreign wheat quotations being about 20 to 30 cents higher, both insiders and outsiders paid some attention. Although this month was close to delivery, it was heard that some factories were prepared to slightly increase their purchases, so the situation had stabilized. For distant months, there was little upward momentum due to sluggish buying sentiment from outsiders. Although orders for the current foreign wheat were slightly sluggish, domestic firms were afraid that prices would rise after they raised them, so they would not be able to place more orders. Therefore, market sentiment was negative. As a result, this month was 3 cents higher than the previous day, November and December were 2 cents higher, January was slightly lower by 1 cent, February was 2 cents higher, and March was unchanged.</p>
<p>Xinhe Cargo: New Walnuts from Tianjin and Foreign Firms Actively Procuring</p>
<p>Price Increased Sharply</p>
<p>Recently, new walnuts have been actively procured from Tianjin by foreign firms due to suitable demand, and prices have gradually increased. Therefore, it is difficult for local firms to compete, and there have been no shipments to Shanghai. Yesterday, it was heard that 250 bags of ordinary Huazhou walnuts were offered at 18 taels, an increase of 2 taels compared to the previous price. Therefore, the market was tight. Yesterday, hand-picked peaches were sold for 25 taels, Changping peaches were at the same price, Pinggu peaches were 23 taels, and Huazhou peaches, which were previously sold for around 16 taels, were now offered at 18.5 taels. Inventories were low and arrivals were scarce. If foreign firms continue to procure walnuts, the market will be even tighter. Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms' Silk Market Increasingly Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday's local foreign firms' silk market was increasingly quiet. Surveys showed that transactions of Shanghai white factory silk were still stagnant in Lyon, and there were no telegrams from New York. Although Shanghai's American firms had some demand for replenishment, their bids were not high, and the market was calm. Yesterday, only Lan Lebi and others purchased 50 bales of Grade B Shanghai white factory silk, Yihong purchased 20 bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk, and Xiangji purchased 5 bales of yellow silk, all at stable prices.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Reasons for the Stagnation of White Factory Silk Sales <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Disasters in various provinces are causing sluggish silk sales... Inventories are still high and sales have decreased significantly. In recent years, the domestic sales of new silk fabrics have been exceptionally strong, with a sharp increase in raw silk consumption. However, local silk prices are high, and various silk factories have come to Shanghai to purchase medium-grade Shanghai white factory silk for weaving high-quality silk fabrics. Therefore, the sales of factory silk fabrics have been quite active. However, since the floods in sixteen provinces, the domestic disasters have been severe, silk sales have been greatly reduced, winter silk orders have sharply decreased, silk inventories are very high, raw material consumption has greatly decreased, and the sales of Shanghai white factory silk fabrics have stopped. In the past one or two months, very few silk merchants from Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Jiaxing have transacted in Shanghai white factory silk.</p>
<p>Shirting White Velvet Cloth Market Remains Stable</p>
<p>Domestic Fine Serge Has Demand from Han Firms</p>
<p>The state of the piece goods is still stagnant. This is due to the unrest in the current situation, severe disasters in various regions, and the complete sealing of eastern goods. There are not many domestic goods, and the source of western goods is scarce. Common products have become increasingly scarce, resulting in a non-existent market. Yesterday, Hankou firms slightly increased their orders for domestic fine serge, but the output was small, like a drop in the ocean. Fanghe Pavilion opened at 3 maces, 7 fen and a half, and Jin Sanding was 3 maces, 6 fen, all of which were Jiangyin fabrics. Sanyang mixed color cotton French velvet was selling well in the local market, with supply falling short of demand. The spot goods were not expected to be delivered until next week, and the price remained at 2 maces and 5 fen. Shirting white velvet cloth remained stable, with 22 Jincheng at 6 taels and 8 maces, 13-pound electric cars at 10 taels, 15-pound electric cars at 11 taels, Double Rabbit at 10 taels, Double Fish Jiqing at 10 taels and 6 maces and a half, Double Bell at 7 taels and 9 maces and a half, and Three Bells at 8 taels and 4 maces and a half. Western goods, 1.6-foot printed velvet, were quite popular because eastern goods could not be sold. Anmao sold for 1 tael, 3 maces and 2 fen and a half, and Chongtai western satin was also extremely firm. Deji goods opened at 4 maces and 7 fen and a half.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Special Article <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<h3 id="e185">A Brief Overview of the American Automobile Industry in Late Summer and Early Autumn by Pei Gan <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>In the final month of this summer, July, the number of American automobile production was 221,485 vehicles. In August, due to Ford's production limitations, its production was also not as high as expected, with the quantity roughly around 155,000 vehicles. The recession in the automobile industry during the summer is about to come to an end. Before the end of the month, Ford announced its production volume as 50,000 vehicles. General Motors' production is expected to be 70,000 to 80,000 vehicles, with 60,000 vehicles being Chevrolet. Chrysler's July production was 25,000 vehicles. If the production and sales of the new streamlined models in August did not reach 37,000 vehicles, then its disappointment can be affirmed. The production volume of other parts of Chrysler is about 50,000 vehicles. Excluding Ford's production volume, adding the production of other car factories, the total automobile production in August should be around 155,000 vehicles.</p>
<p>Every year at the end of summer, the American automobile industry often experiences a decline. This is a normal phenomenon throughout the years and is not surprising. Therefore, although automobile production in July and August is so low, the factories are quite optimistic about the autumn market. This is because the autumn season is a turning point for automobile sales. Each manufacturer strives to sell at this time to promote the progress of their business. Based on the forecast for this year's situation, the sales of low-priced cars will have a greater advantage in the autumn. Manufacturers that produce low-priced cars, such as Ford and Chevrolet, are all rallying to save the sales of their products. Therefore, the overall automobile production in the United States in September will definitely exceed July and August, and the car manufacturing performance in the last quarter of this year will definitely be the best of the other three quarters.</p>
<p>Metabolism is the only key factor in the automobile business. Every new car that is released must use various methods to seek sales, and its replacement of old cars is even more important. However, if the market is weak and sales are not strong, then the fate of new cars will also be greatly affected. The new cars that came out in the American market this summer have been greatly affected by this. Therefore, in the past few months, the sales of new cars have been far less than the current situation. Recently, various businesses have had active turnarounds, and new cars have appeared, and their future is quite promising.</p>
<p>There is another matter that hinders current car sales, which is that each factory will have new models coming out. Buyers often postpone the purchase because the factories will release new cars in the early autumn. Therefore, those who intend to buy must wait for the new cars to come out before deciding on their purchase plans. For this reason, every year at this time, there is a period of transition. Sales of old cars have already been weak, while new cars have not yet been released. Therefore, there is a temporary standstill, and production and sales both tend towards a slump. As for the factories, they attach more importance to this matter. In addition to the need for demand, they do not allow excessive production to avoid stagnation. Instead, they use their remaining energy to manufacture new cars, so that when the new cars are released, they can develop on a large scale.</p>
<p>The new cars for next year are currently being rushed to manufacture by the factories. There has been a lot of progress in terms of innovation and improvement, and there are the latest plans that have never been seen in the automobile industry before, which will also be unveiled in the 1932 models. Most of these new cars cannot be sold at this moment and must wait until the beginning of winter to be released. When it comes to low-priced cars, the competition among factories next year will be even more spectacular. The factories that are currently manufacturing low-priced cars are already exhausting their efforts and planning day and night to manufacture their new cars in the most economical way, so that buyers can get the most practical means of transportation at the lowest possible price.</p>
<p>Regarding the promotion of new cars, the factories have also come up with various methods to seek urgent sales. Therefore, new cars have gradually appeared in the American market. However, their types are not very complete, and buyers are mostly waiting and seeing. Their intention is nothing more than to wait for all the new cars to be released before making a decision on which one to choose. Several factories have widely publicized the features of their new cars in order to promote their new models and have used methods such as discounts on old cars and low down payments to attract customers. However, the results have not been as satisfactory as expected, because buyers will not have the intention of replacing new cars until the beginning of winter. The biggest reason is that they must wait until the New York Auto Show next spring before deciding on their purchase plans.</p>
<p>Although there are currently no precise statistics on American car sales in September, experts estimate that it is approximately 180,000 vehicles, which is an improvement compared to August, but still low and insignificant. From September to December, the production and sales performance in October, November, and December will definitely be better than in the previous quarters. This is because the end of the year is approaching, and buyers are planning for next spring, so they will add new cars at this time. The new models of each factory will also be released gradually in these two or three months.</p>
<p>In addition to passenger cars, the sales of freight trucks have recently turned around. The factories have seen improvements in both production and sales. Therefore, the factories that specialize in manufacturing freight trucks are also quite optimistic about the future. The strong sales of freight trucks are often a precursor to the strong sales of passenger cars. Production and sales in August have verifiable records, and the bright future does not seem to be a lie.</p>

<p>Speed Higher Than Mail Car</p>
<p>The French Automobile Company, the Bombay dealer of Morris cars, recently received a letter from its customer, Mr. Brass, from Aparacheng, praising the excellent performance of the Morris car he purchased. The following is a partial translation of the original letter for the readers: "To whom it may concern. I purchased a Morris small car from your company on January 9, 1930, last year. It has been used for seventeen months now. Today, it took only nine hours to travel 365 miles from the Old Crow Children's Shop to Aparacheng, which means an average speed of more than 40 miles per hour. This is especially gratifying to me and I am happy to inform your company. I departed from the Old Crow Children's Shop at 1:30 p.m. on May 25 and arrived in Laizhou at 5 p.m., where I stayed overnight. What is most gratifying about this few hours of speeding is that when I departed from the Pingdian store, my friend happened to take the mail car to England. At that time, we bid each other farewell and agreed to talk again when the car arrived at Laizhou Station. At first, I thought my friend would arrive at the station first. Unexpectedly, my car arrived safely before the mail car. So I sat quietly and sipped tea, waiting for my friend to arrive. The next morning at 6:30, I continued my journey from Lai Station and arrived at Aparacheng at exactly 2 p.m. In total, the time spent resting on this journey was two hours. One was for breakfast at Jukulandu, and the other was to detour to Shagou to avoid the livestock. Apart from these two delays, the only unfortunate event encountered along the way was a slight puncture in the car tire. However, this had no effect on</p>

<p>20-Year-Old Renault Car</p>
<p>Good Machinery Runs As Usual Renault Cars, a French manufacturer, are known for their beauty, precision, and fuel efficiency. People from all countries consistently praise them, and their global popularity is no accident. The car was placed by the wealthy maritime merchant Hadong and has been used for 20 years. It still runs completely as usual. Hadong took it for a walk every day when he was still alive. The long-lasting durability of the Renault car can be seen here.</p>
<p>Car driving is not related at all. It was not discovered until the morning after the end of the trip. Currently, all parts of the car have not been replaced, and the original tires are still in use and are still in good condition. In addition, what is especially worth mentioning is that this trip consumed a total of eight gallons of gasoline, which means that each gallon traveled 45 miles. As for the car's load capacity, although there was only one passenger, the rear of the car was fully loaded with luggage and sundries."</p>

<h3 id="e189">Physiology Class <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>Whenever it was time for a boring lesson, there were always many classmates talking, making a fuss, and it was never quiet. Especially during physiology class, the newly arrived physiology teacher was extremely polite to the students, not very strict. It was really out of helplessness, because if the teacher said, "Hey, please be quiet," then there would be many impolite remarks offered, leaving the teacher unable to defend himself. Therefore, whenever it was physiology class, it was either talking or making a fuss, and very few people listened quietly. Even among those who seemed to be listening quietly, half of them were using novels as substitutes.</p>
<p>Among them, there was a Miss Mao who disliked the physiology teacher even more. During class, she always substituted with novels. She put the novel in the drawer, pulled the drawer open, leaned her body against the wall, and stared at the novel. A physiology book was placed on the desk. In this way, she could read steadily. If the teacher walked over, she would quickly close the drawer and cough a few times, as if preparing to start speaking.</p>
<p>One day, her novel was borrowed by a friend in the same room. Coincidentally, she encountered a physiology class she had no interest in. She then came up with a few difficult questions to ask the teacher. These questions were all outside the book. Later, she suddenly said, "Teacher, what are you talking about? Why can't we understand anything?"</p>
<p>"Then I'll explain it again," the teacher said slowly.</p>
<p>"No, teacher, you shouldn't speak in your local dialect. It's so unclear, it's really frustrating. Teacher, please speak Mandarin."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mandarin, but I speak Mandarin like this too."</p>
<p>"Then, what if we don't understand?"</p>
<p>"············"</p>
<p>In fact, although what he said was not pure Mandarin, it was very clear if listened to quietly. Miss Mao did not absolutely not understand, but for some reason, she always hated this teacher very much.</p>
<p>The class bell rang, and the teacher hurriedly walked out, as if escaping from hell. After the teacher left, Miss Mao said loudly, "Is this kind of teacher worthy of teaching us? Let's all go tell the Dean. Anyway, the Dean is very good to our class."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it's not that easy," a Miss Zhuang quickly stood up and said.</p>
<p>"No, let's tell him that we don't understand what he's saying. It's impossible to listen to," Mao said angrily, "Then who is willing to talk to the Dean?" Miss Lu, who was sitting in the corner, quickly chimed in.</p>

<h3 id="e191">The Conflict Between Chinese and Indigenous People in North Pekalongan by Qiu Bin Cun <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>"Where the sun shines, the British flag flies." This is the proud saying of the British. "Where the sun shines, there are Chinese living there." This is the honor we Chinese can have. The number of Chinese scattered across the five continents is estimated at ten million. We Chinese are endowed with the characteristics of hard work and endurance, and even more with a spirit of loving peace. Therefore, we Chinese have always been able to live an economical life peacefully under the rule of the government of our place of residence, without other ambitions. The economic power of the Chinese in various locations has also been at its peak for a time. However, since the Industrial Revolution in the seventeenth century, the industries of various industrialized countries have increased year by year. After the development of commercial capital in the nineteenth century, the capital of various industrialized countries has also increased year by year. By the time of the era of financial capital in the twentieth century, the various industrialized countries have even more problems of overproduction, overcapitalization, surplus labor, and economic panic. In order to solve the contradictions of their own surplus power and economic panic, capitalist imperialists have established various immigration regulations and the expulsion of Chinese. Recently, we have easily seen the expulsion of Chinese in Mexico, the expulsion of Chinese in Japan, and the expulsion of Chinese by local scholars in various colonies in the newspapers. The situation of the expulsion of Chinese by Koreans under Japanese rule is the most serious. Readers have already seen the facts about the Korean expulsion of Chinese in various domestic newspapers, so I will not repeat them. What I want to report to my compatriots here is the fact that the indigenous people of North Pekalongan in the Dutch and Portuguese East Indies are expelling Chinese.</p>
<h3 id="e192">1. Reasons <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Dutch Commercial Gazette of Semarang has a record of the evil tide of expelling Chinese in North Pekalongan. According to the report of the North Pekalongan government, it is not yet said in detail that a brawl between Chinese and indigenous people occurred in front of the Kertod Mosque several months ago. The evil tide in North Pekalongan and the brawl in Kertod both carried the religious idea of expelling Chinese. In addition, Dr. Kramer, a Dutch official in North Pekalongan, established an indigenous middle-class society, which led to the anti-Chinese movement. The Dutch official himself could not save this crazy wave. In fact, if the local officials had advised the indigenous middle-class society not to use illegal means to compete with Chinese merchants in business last October or November, the disaster could have been prevented. This evil tide was entirely caused by the terrifying policies of various usurers. First, they spread the anti-Chinese color with religious overtones, and then Dr. Kramer incited them from behind, causing the anti-Chinese tide to break through and unable to bring it back on track.</p>
<p>(2) A dispatch from Batavia stated that North Pekalongan (state) in Dutch Java is a quiet small town on the north coast of Java. A long time ago, economic competition occurred between Chinese merchants and local people, so it has become an uneasy place. Many Chinese shops have announced their closure, and now they have reopened, but business is extremely deserted. They are still preparing to close at any time. After 5:00 p.m. every day, Chinese shops that are still open for business are as rare as phoenix feathers. Because of this, the retail industry has been greatly affected and has simply given European import wholesalers a great loss. As for the emergence of this economic enmity, it is because the local scholars wanted to establish retail sales to compete with Chinese shops, and later these shops sprang up like mushrooms after rain. The establishment of such shops in North Pekalongan and its vicinity all showed their sound organization and effective management, which gave Chinese small merchants a great blow. The customers of these local scholars' shops are mostly local scholars (Javanese). They are very loyal and would rather not buy the goods of Chinese shops even though they know they are cheaper. The losses suffered by Chinese shops in this business are unimaginable. Therefore, there are those who are unable to repay the debts of European import wholesalers, and those who threaten Europeans, saying that they must not wholesale goods to local scholars' shops anymore. The local government has tried its best to provide relief for this economic conflict, but it has been ineffective, and the Chinese authorities have been able to provide very little assistance to them.</p>
<p>From this point of view, we understand that the reasons for the expulsion of Chinese in North Pekalongan include religious discrimination and economic competition. In fact, there is also a hidden background of national struggles and the provocation of imperialists.</p>
<p>Two, Facts</p>
<p>The incidents of discord between Chinese and indigenous people in the North Pekalongan government, especially the various disputes that occurred in the city of North Pekalongan, are presented. The recent causes that directly triggered the riots, which led to the discord between Chinese and indigenous people, can be identified as coming from the following successive events:</p>
<p>(1) A Javanese from Cilimusni drove a truck and knocked down a Chinese peddler, Liu Yisun, on Ganbaran Street in North Pekalongan. The goods sold by Liu Yisun were scattered all over the road. Liu Yisun was furious and grabbed the truck driver to beat him. Just then, a barber named Simon, who came from Kajangan, stepped forward to help his compatriot and beat Liu Yisun back. From then on, many beatings continued to occur.</p>
<p>(2) Li Qingquan, who lived in Kajangan, was beaten by local people Rulacin and Zhaqimari.</p>
<p>(3) Liu Yisun, who lived in Kelimunan, was hit in the head with a sharp object by several local scholars.</p>
<p>(4) Li Shunyan was injured by three local scholars on Wenmai Street and sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>(5) Xu Chunzong was punched by several local scholars on Kelogelan Street at about 9:00 p.m.</p>
<p>(6) Zheng Zhenzhang, who lived in Walongyasen (belonging to the Madanglerhen district), was injured with a sharp object by two local scholars near Lanlongshali in the evening and sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>(7) Chen Jinsong was attacked by a local scholar named Zhasmali in Wanya Township. The murderer's record was filed.</p>
<p>(8) Huang Songshi was injured by a local scholar on the north street of Kelaya. The injury was serious.</p>
<p>(9) Huang Qingcai was carrying the Tua Pek Kong home and was hit in the head by several local scholars on Benchoer Street at 9:00 p.m.</p>
<p>(10) Shi Changfu, who lived in Banzhang Gulun, was punched by five local scholars on Wenmai Street. He spat blood and was sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>(11) Yan Zhaoneng, who lived in Jialengyare Township, was hit in the head by a local scholar on Basha Yare Street and sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>(12) Suli, who lived on Basha Yare Street, reported to the police that he was stoned into the house by local scholars in the evening.</p>
<p>(13) Shi Guiqing, who came from Wanyueshali, was hit in the right ear with an iron object by a local scholar on the tenth street of Kepuluo, causing it to bleed.</p>
<p>(14) The shop with He on Yajiaran Street was stoned into the shop by local scholars. The shopkeeper was hit by a stone on the back.</p>
<p>(15) Huang Yungui, the owner of the Longjing Railway Cafe, was injured in the hand by a local scholar in the station.</p>
<p>(16) Huang Qingtai was riding a bicycle and passing by Benchoer Street when he was suddenly attacked from behind by a local scholar, fell off the bicycle, and was injured in the head and shoulders.</p>
<p>(17) Shi Guixing was attacked from behind by a local scholar on Kepuluogan Street and injured his right hand. He was admitted to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>(18) Li Zhaoman, an iron merchant on Kepuluogan Street, was beaten by a local scholar named Laisted.</p>
<p>The following is a list of cases of Chinese people being beaten outside the city of North Pekalongan: (1) Cai Shengzhang was beaten by a local scholar named Zhasmali on Wu Ji'e Street due to a debt problem.</p>
<p>(2) Zheng Tianzhang was hit in the head and back of the head with a sharp object by a local scholar when he was riding a bicycle past Lanlongshali. The injury was quite serious.</p>
<p>(3) Xu Xingde was stabbed in the left ear and cheek with a sharp object by a local scholar in front of the Wu Yalan City Market and was admitted to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>(4) Chen Wuchun, who lived in Dido Township, reported to the police that he was stoned in his house by local scholars.</p>
<p>(5) Shi Juexun, who also lived in Dido Township, was injured in the lip by a local scholar named Huali.</p>
<p>(6) Su Ruishun complained to the police that he and Ye Qingdun were riding bicycles together when they were knocked down by a local scholar, causing the skin on both hands to be scratched.</p>
<p>(7) Huang Xiyuan encountered guerrillas in the countryside of Kedas and was asked by the guerrillas. He was frightened and ran away and was suspected of being a thief, so he was chased and beaten and injured and admitted to the hospital.</p>
<p>(8) Ye Baoyuan, the owner of a Waruliyalong shop, was surrounded and beaten by local scholars when he closed the shop at 8:30 p.m. that evening.</p>
<p>These are just reports of Chinese being injured by local scholars with bare hands or with stones and instruments in the past two or three months. Later, the methods became more and more violent, even changing from using sticks and blades to using guns and bullets to treat our Chinese.</p>
<p>Three, Appeals from the Chinese</p>
<p>The Chinese Consul and Vice-Consul in Semarang went to North Pekalongan to observe the local people, and requested the Consul to telegraph the Chinese government as soon as possible to send a warship to warn the Dutch government and save the Chinese in North Pekalongan from economic panic.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the economic competition between the Chinese and Javanese people, not only has the goods of the Chinese been resisted by the local scholars, but also the two sides often have conflicts, making the feelings even more broken and making the situation more and more dangerous.</p>
<p>Regarding the request of our Chinese to send warships for protection, the Dutch and Japanese newspapers in Batavia have commented on it, doing their best to ridicule, even saying that our country's warships are afraid of pirates. Such insults can indeed make us feel very embarrassed when reading them. Here, I will translate and publish the papers of the two newspapers. I don't know how the Chinese people will feel when they read them, and the National Government should also reflect on it.</p>
<p>The Dutch Daily News in Batavia and another Dutch newspaper criticized, saying that the Chinese in North Pekalongan have appealed to the Chinese government to send a large number of warships to North Pekalongan to protect the Chinese there. At the end, it was said that the Chinese warships must not dare to come to the Dutch East Indies because they are afraid of being attacked by pirates... etc.</p>
<p>In addition, the Japanese newspaper Yi Zhua Bang Ri Bao in Batavia criticized an incident in North Pekalongan. Here is an excerpt of its main points:</p>
<p>The conflict between the local scholars and the Chinese in North Pekalongan actually contains various very important meanings. As a result, they resorted to economic solutions. On the one hand, they dared to carry out a boycott-style closure, threatening the import merchants. On the other hand, the Chinese Consul-General directly negotiated with the Governor-General. Therefore, the most embarrassed were the Dutch import merchants, promoting the strict vigilance of the authorities. Now the Chinese in North Pekalongan are requesting the Consul-General to ask the Nanjing National Government for warships to come to the port to directly protect the lives and property of the Chinese there. In fact, the Chinese warships are now only on the banks of the Yangtze River, guarding against bandits and pirates, and have no time to send warships to Java.</p>
