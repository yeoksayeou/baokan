<p>世界軍縮會議。將於明年二月二日開大會。此會能否成功。即可以覘今後世界和平之是否長久。誠爲世界上一重大問題也。國聯會開行政會時。英外相漢德森氏謂。渠俟回抵倫敦後。英政府即將開始進行軍縮之籌備工作。望聯合會各國咸能聚精會神從事此舉云云。又云軍縮會之草約。茲已告成。草約中此次必須注入軍縮之數目字云云。英外相之意此次會議。必須得有具體結果。所謂軍備之縮减。减至若何程度。必有一定之數目非僅承認軍縮之原則也然而當時英外相之言法外長則贊成之。德外長則反對。之德外長寇蒂士之意。以爲軍縮大會。决定實行國聯約章第八條之各國應縮减軍備。至與其國家安寗相適合之最低度之說則並不反對。但對於草約中某某數點則不贊同。由此以觀則軍縮大會之進行。雖未必全無希望。而其間爭論。則必甚爲劇烈。蓋各國間利害不同。而軍備又認爲國家生命之所繫。均不肯貿然退讓也或又慮及軍縮大會開會之期未至而各國之戰禍先巳不免者斯乃憂世過甚之言我未敢信。</p>

<p>稱後者絀。當年渡江化爲龍。晉宋之後王江東。不見鴉兒鐵騎黑。但問燕子春燈紅。引杯在手事已足。攬鏡却顧人圖儂。漢家三百業中斬。遂令坐罪庸主庸。冒生我友意不然。謂此判案殊未公天子風流亦何過。無臣先泣明思宗。馬阮老姦實誤國。何况胡運非人功。君不見銅臺未分妓香薄。柏梁爭齧妃　穠。孰知沈飮非荒宴。往往不在咸陽宮。又不見六朝帝子生可憐。五代無賴皆英雄。持彼黜此泥成敗。臧穀之辨如莊蒙。與子試問頭上月。敝屣萬有誰能從。爲此招邀金焦峰。佳節亦有良儔逢。邵家夫婦光與鴻。不知許事追攀窮。待月得雨將無同。歸來一一歌長風。有屐不蠟吾甚慵。</p>

<p>— 蔣梅笙</p>
<p>戴君志昻。肄業中央大學。善余女夫徐悲鴻君紀元二十年一月十八日。戴君以摩陀車來。邀作湯山之遊。羣喜而從之。偕往者。法教授邵可侶君。戴君學友丁君余及次女碧微。外孫伯陽。長幼都七人也。湯山距新都。可五十里而遙。摩陀車駛行。一小時可達。是日以十時半發軔。午後一時半始至則以中途有留滯也。</p>
<p>先是悲鴻嘗一至墳頭之青龍山。云有巨碑之材。鑿自石崖。而一端未殊。側立地上。脩（亦可云廣）約六十公足。廣（亦可云高）約十四公尺。厚四公尺。實宇內之奇觀。以史考之。蓋明永樂朝。嘗規取以勒聖德神功之碑。旣而弗果。遂棄之荒野云。聞者莫不色動。欲一探其奇。是日遂駐車村落步往尋之。詎意相距遼遠。田塍旣濘滑。山徑又多荆棘。余殊憚行。遂止於中道。約俟同人之返。而偕降焉。於是枯坐石上。歷一小時餘丶四顧無人。但有荒草寒風肅然。砭肌透骨。猶幸時方日中。設易以薄晚者。雖孟賁之心。恐不能不震震懼矣。又久之。同人始至。然後循徑下山。登車復行。不二十分鐘。而湯山已至。</p>
<p>山以湯泉得名。自昔蔽榛莽。不爲世知。民國以來始稍稍著。及新都肇建。益爲勝區。湯山俱樂部者。國府委員某某······等四巨公。組織以供政暇休沐者也。外人不得入焉。其設湢售資以供民衆浴者。高下有差。最精者曰陶廬。可餐可浴。取値稍昻。中產以上多就之。吾儕始至。亦入其中。方擬命酒選殽。一果枵腹。而典守俱樂部之某君。固請於戴君。謂「今日部中無客。公子旣賁臨。自宜於彼欵客。母謙抑也。」於是戴君肅客入俱樂部。命治午餐。殽凡九簋。味甚甘旨。食竟。請入浴。余所浴者。殆某巨公行廬。地衣柔厚。錦榻銅床。略如大旅邸之甲等室。其内一室。則湯池在焉。池甃以水泥。作長方形。脩丈餘而廣得其三之二。泉亦以手旋機司啓閉。與尋常浴池等。特清潔耳。溫度適宜。浴之愉快。同人一一浴竟。時已酉初。復步行訪二里外之湯王廟。廟湫隘不足觀。而殿後牡丹一株。枝柯繁盛。殆百年外物。惜未覩其花時榮茂狀也。廟之西。亦有湯池。環以短垣。而壁界其中。以別男女。農工者流。麋浴其中。以視俱樂部丶不禁喟然興欵。謂平等之說。實現非易也。於是復返俱樂部。登車言歸。瀕行。悲鴻出五金犒兵士之侍役者。而典守某君堅辭弗受。此固足見主者訓練之嚴。而吾儕之意丶實歉歉焉。旣展輪。疾駛入城。則巳燈火盈市矣。</p>

<p>昨視某先生疾。見其案頭有運甓稿存一冊。假以歸。中有夜光木詩二首。幷有序文。是非常有之物也。錄登自由談。以供植物學家之研究。序云。余始遷祖祠。舊栽柏四本。三株榮茂。西一株以枯易者屢矣。去年復經易植。其枯株則舉而委之。至踰月剔其膚。夜忽瑩然有光。根尤雪亮丶族子逵九曰。是殆所謂夜光木歟。什襲藏之。昔康熙朝。得夜光木。聖祖有御製賦。至今照耀藝林。厥後吾邑華筠堤先生。余之堂姑丈也。晚年好道。於乾隆丙申歲。得夜光木。一時名流。題詠殆徧。裝爲四册。冠以小像。余展誦之下。賞其珠璣。每以未睹此木爲憾。茲竟於吾家祠趾產之。發潛德之幽光。以光大吾宗。於此兆其端歟。爰賦詩二絕紀之。詩曰。照乘允推希世竇。囊塋無乃轉勞人。誰知尺木深宵裏。耀我門閭若有神。傳觀到處暗生明。共訝人間得未曾。「余折一枝。携至蘇城。徧示同人。竟無識者。」遮莫星精憐夜讀。故吹藜火當書燈。運甓稿存。下未　作者姓名。係無錫黃姓者所著。某先生云。</p>

<p>六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>原來自有聲電影發明以來。一般人早已預言將來除電影外。不會再有舞台戲劇的存在。因電影旣能說話歌唱。凡舞台戲劇所能者。電影無不能之。而電影所能者舞台戲劇却不盡能。「多諾哥」旣由電影劇本改成。所需佈景塲面至物。前後凡二十七塲。在舞台戲劇中可謂僅見。除皮加劇院之大機關舞台外。他屬均不能排演。「多諾哥」之上演實有擴充舞台戯劇佈景範圍以與電影競爭之意。故說者以爲可由「多諾哥」劇之成敗。預測舞台戯劇时將來。</p>
<p>「多諾哥」的內容大略如此。一個呌做拉莽丹的男子立在一條河上的橋頭預備自殺。恰好他一個朋友從那兒經過把他救了。並介紹他到一個專治精神病的醫生家去求治。這醫生給他的方子是呌他於五點四十五分時候立在巴黎回教寺院前。呌他靠近並把他的全身全心獻給那第一個從他身邊經過並用手揩着鼻涕的人。拉莽丹照着醫生的話做。果然在那地方和那時候見着那最先從他身旁經過秀手揩着鼻涕的人。這是教授特洛得（Yves　le　Tronhadec）先生。拉莽丹和這教授攀談上了。並且一直跟着他家裡。這教授把他心裡所最希望的一件事情告訴他了。他希望當選做一個國家學會的會員。以他堂堂教授的資格這事本來頗有實現的可能的。但不幸他著的一本世界地理上亂吹着一個都會。而這都會實際沒有。因此頗受他的同輩攻擊。爲補救這錯誤計。非創造這烏有的都會出來不可。拉莽丹毅然接受了這個任務。他要去創設這實際沒有的多諾哥城。全劇最複雜的地方便自此開始。</p>

<p>Preliminary Discussion of Conditions</p>
<p>(Beiping) An American banker told me that although the American side is prepared for a large loan, they have not yet received official acceptance from China. Recently, there have been preliminary discussions in Washington and Shanghai. The conditions revealed by the President of the Legislative Yuan are generally the same, or there may be one or two items that are unknown to the outside world, but it is credible that they are definitely not political relations like previous loans. If this 100 million [dollars] is realized, it must be paid in full within two years. A bank management team must be formed. Whether this bank will be separate or part of the Central Bank has not yet been determined. The American side may entrust a supervisor to participate, but will not interfere in the bank's administrative affairs, only in the nature of managing the repayment fund. Currently, the Chinese government and public opinion have a very good impression of American capital, because the social and economic situation is unstable and a large amount of money is needed for circulation. If this is established, the bank can issue 150 million [dollars] in banknotes, with 75% as reserve, so there is no worry about its soundness. It is expected that the North-South railways, factories, river management, and mining industries can accommodate 2 million people in direct employment, and ten times that number of people will indirectly rely on it for livelihood through family support and social commerce. If this loan is realized, the first installment will be delivered after the National Assembly opens and before the fiscal year starts on July 1st. However, it is still difficult to predict whether it will be realized at present. I asked if there were any international obstacles. He replied, "If the American banking group is willing to lend, no other country can do anything about it." I also asked whether the New Banking Consortium would require participation. He replied, "The New Banking Consortium's contract has not been implemented by various countries. This is another banking group outside of the New Banking Consortium. If the New Banking Consortium is willing to negotiate with China, it does not hinder this. In other words, other countries are not prohibited from lending to China, it depends on whether China accepts it or not." I also asked whether the German loan of 24 million Gold Marks was closer than the American loan. He replied, "The nature is different. The German loan is not purely cash, but a valuation of machinery and other items that China needs, and the actual cash found is not much. What the Chinese government hopes for, of course, is cash." (Twenty-fourth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A member of the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan said that Anglo-American loans for silver production are not unfavorable to China, but three points must be noted: (1) It must be used for productive enterprises. (2) It should be managed by the government to remint silver coins for the payment of wages and the purchase of materials, and should not be handed over to the bank to avoid excessive spending. (3) Restrict the bank's issuance of banknotes. If there is full preparation, it can be issued. In this way, the unemployed can get jobs in the short term. (Twenty-fourth Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Ping Bao reported that both parties have formally contacted the League of Nations for a loan of 100 million gold pounds, which will be used to change to the gold standard, and said that this loan is more in line with the situation than the American loan. I asked key figures from British and American banking groups, and they said that the time for formal contact has not yet arrived. Because international loans are not as simple as the American and Canadian banking groups, and the American loan is still more in line with the situation. (Twenty-fourth Dispatch)</p>

<p>To be convened in Geneva next February</p>
<p>Not yet agreed to by Italy and Germany</p>
<p>German-Polish dispute deadlocked</p>
<p>Geneva, 23rd (National Society Telegram) The Administrative Council of the League of Nations held a routine meeting this afternoon, followed by a closed-door meeting.  It is reported that the Disarmament Conference has been decided to be held in Geneva on February 2nd next year.  Only the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy have not yet agreed.  As for the issue of the chairmanship, it will be postponed to the May meeting.  The Administrative Council has expressed its unwillingness to relinquish its right to appoint the chairman.  The German-Polish dispute seems to have reached a complete deadlock.  The German Foreign Minister strongly advocated an investigation by the League of Nations, while the Polish Foreign Minister strongly opposed it, believing that Polish internal affairs should not be interfered with by others. If a compromise cannot be reached before Saturday morning, it will be reopened for public discussion.  French Foreign Minister Briand, due to cabinet turmoil, urgently wishes to return home and proposed postponing the discussion until May, but the German Foreign Minister strongly opposed it.</p>
<p>Geneva, 24th (Reuters) Today, the League of Nations Administrative Council held an open meeting. The chairman, British Foreign Secretary Henderson, declared that after his return to London, the British government will begin preparations for the Disarmament Conference. He deeply hopes that all members of the League of Nations will concentrate their efforts on this endeavor. The groundwork of the Disarmament Preparatory Committee (referring to the draft treaty) has now been completed. This time, numbers must be included. German Foreign Minister Curtius rose and stated that Germany had not agreed to the draft treaty and was therefore not bound by it. The issue should continue to be discussed at length. French Foreign Minister Briand rose and expressed agreement with the British Foreign Secretary, and urged the German Foreign Minister. The Preparatory Committee has been working diligently for five years and has reached the greatest consensus. If the discussion is reopened, it will jeopardize the cause of the Conference. Curtius replied that he agreed that all countries should attend the Conference and decide to implement Article 8 of the League of Nations Covenant (which stipulates that countries should reduce armaments to the lowest level consistent with national security). He did not say that the entire issue should be re-discussed, but Germany was not comfortable with certain points.</p>
<p>Geneva, 23rd (Reuters) The Advisory Committee on Opium Trade today adopted a report to the League of Nations Administrative Council. The Committee also approved a draft convention to limit the manufacture of narcotics to the legitimate needs of the world's science, and to manage their distribution.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Round Table Conference Decides on Separation of India and Burma <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Successful Policy to Reduce Revolutionary Forces in India</p>
<p>Contents of Central and Local Government Organization</p>
<p>Gandhi Expected to be Released in Geneva</p>
<p>Funeral of Deceased Muslim Representative</p>
<p>London News:  The British-Indian Round Table Conference, which opened one and a half months ago, concluded on the 19th.  The three important cases that have been resolved are: (1) the organization of the central government; (2) the organization of local governments; and (3) the separation of India and Burma. These are described below:  (1) "Organization of the Central Government"  This case was proposed by Sankey.  Its content is to organize a federal government by uniting the principalities that have joined the federation, and to allow the principalities that have not joined the federation to join at any time.  From this point of view, this case completely adopts the Simon Commission report.  As for the federal parliament, it adopts a bicameral system.  The two houses are composed of representatives from British India and the princely states.  When the two houses disagree, all matters are decided by a joint meeting of the two houses.  (2) "Organization of Local Governments"  The organization of local governments in India has always been a dualistic administration.  This case decides to establish a single administrative organ.  The administrative chiefs of each state are nominally appointed by the state governor, but in reality, the members of the party with a majority in the state assembly can control the appointment and removal of the governor.  This is a noteworthy point.  In short, the powers of the state governor have been greatly reduced, but they still have absolute power and can use their power to deal with everything in times of emergency.  (3) "Separation of India and Burma"  Regarding the separation of India and Burma, the British government's attitude is very firm, so no one raised any objections at the Round Table Conference, and it was immediately resolved.  In the future, the British government can directly formulate a new constitution with representatives from Burma, without the participation of representatives from India.  This matter will be resolved at another round table conference.  As for the fact that India and Burma will not only be separated politically in the future, but also economically, the realization of this separation is actually a success of the British government's policy of reducing the overall revolutionary forces in India.

<p>Weak negotiations with China and Russia</p>
<p>Opposing party adds insult to injury</p>
<p>Former Finance Minister Sanshi presses the government</p>
<p>House of Representatives in great chaos three times the day before yesterday</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Electric Communication) In the House of Representatives plenary session, which began debating the acting prime minister issue, questioning of the ministers of state began yesterday. First, former Finance Minister Sanshi took the podium and said: Since last year, the government has been optimistic about the future of the economic world, but the actual situation in the financial world is greatly contrary to the government's expectations, and the recession is deepening. The voices of resentment against the current cabinet are deafening among the people. (At that time, the opposition party applauded loudly and shouted "Enemy of the people.") Sanshi continued, saying: The reason for such a recession is entirely the result of the unprepared gold standard lifting. Japan is a country based on agriculture. If the price of rice and raw silk plummets, the purchasing power will decrease, causing the decline of commerce and industry. The government, while advocating to reduce prices and restrict production in order to reorganize enterprises, abused the silk price compensation law. Although it prevented the price of silk from falling, the result was a great loss to the people. What the government is doing disregards the interests of farmers and only supports the interests of a few financiers and capitalists. It is putting the cart before the horse, which is very strange. (At that time, the ruling party tried to interfere, and Speaker Fujisawa repeatedly called for silence.) Sanshi continued, saying: The government declared that the surplus from military reduction would be used to reduce taxes, but most of it was used to supplement the plan, and only a small amount was used to reduce taxes. What the government said was false propaganda, deceiving the people to the extreme. (At that time, the ruling party was furious and shouted for Sanshi to withdraw his slip of the tongue.) Speaker Fujisawa interjected, saying: Mr. Sanshi's speech seems to contain inappropriate words. The transcript will be investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Then Fujii and Fukazawa of the Seiyukai rushed to the Speaker's seat and slammed the table and cursed the secretary-general. The ruling party was also angry, and the whole party stood up. Yamada and Sakuda of the ruling party also rushed to the Speaker's seat and shouted for punishment. The Diet hall was in great chaos. Mr. Sanshi stood on the podium, unable to advance or retreat. Soon, Fukazawa and Fujii stepped down, and the Diet hall returned to calm. Sanshi began to continue his speech, saying: The government touted the non-borrowing policy, and realized the fallacy of its policy, and then issued railway bonds, and abused the issuance of various public bonds in the name of rescuing unemployment and various other names. This is nothing but a flaw in the current cabinet's public bond policy. He pointed to Finance Minister Inoue and spoke in a stern tone. Then he said to Navy Minister Ambo: After repeated disputes between the government and the Naval General Staff, the supplementary plan was established. However, is this plan safe for national defense? Will the future supplementary ship construction plan endanger the national treasury and finances? He asked questions for ten minutes and then stepped down from the podium. At that time, the ruling party submitted a motion to punish Fukazawa and Fujii, and the Diet hall fell into great chaos again. In the end, it was put to a vote by roll call. As a result, by an absolute majority, the two were handed over to the disciplinary committee. Next, Finance Minister Inoue took the podium to refute Sanshi's questions one by one. Finally, he said that Mr. Sanshi's estimate of revenue was too large. This is because the view of the financial situation is different. The subsequent argument was not very thorough, and the Seiyukai ridiculed him. Inoue then stepped down from the podium. Navy Minister Ambo took the podium to answer, his words were extremely simple, only saying that there was no need to worry about the supplementary plan at all. Sanshi took the podium again, saying that the fatigue of the rural areas is no greater than today. This is due to the government's policy failure. For example, the unemployment public bond is a metropolitan-biased doctrine, without considering the rural areas at all. He also said to Navy Minister Ambo: Is the national defense plan really worry-free? Inoue took the podium again, and when he was about to answer, Harajuku and Imai Takehiko of the Seiyukai rushed to the podium, but were stopped by the guards. Then, Yamato of the Kokumin Domei took the podium to question Finance Minister Inoue about the issue of excessive revenue estimates, the issue of illegal budget reorganization, and the issue of unemployment bonds. At that time, there were already many empty seats in the Diet hall, and an atmosphere of laziness was permeating. After Finance Minister Inoue answered one by one, Muto said that Mr. Inoue's answer can be said to be extremely irresponsible. (The following is a Jiji Press dispatch) Finally, Matsuoka of the Seiyukai took the podium to question the diplomatic issues. First, he attacked the government's inaction in diplomacy with Britain and the United States, and then criticized the weakness in negotiations with Russia and China, and the incompetence of the Manchuria-Mongolia policy. Acting Prime Minister Shidehara took the podium to answer, and members of the Seiyukai shouted "Traitor." Shidehara was unable to speak for a while, and the members then announced the adjournment.</p>

<h3 id="e66">World Disarmament Conference <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The World Disarmament Conference will convene on February 2nd next year. Whether this conference can succeed will indicate whether world peace will be long-lasting in the future. It is truly a major issue for the world. At the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting, British Foreign Secretary Henderson said that after his return to London, the British government will begin preparations for disarmament work, hoping that all countries of the United Nations will concentrate their efforts on this matter. He also said that the draft treaty of the Disarmament Conference has now been completed, and this time the number of disarmament must be included in the draft treaty. British Foreign Secretary intended that this meeting must have concrete results, that is, the extent to which armaments should be reduced must have a certain number, and not only admit the principle of disarmament. However, at that time, the French Foreign Minister agreed with the British Foreign Secretary's remarks, while the German Foreign Minister opposed them. German Foreign Minister Curtius did not oppose the statement that the Disarmament Conference decided to implement Article 8 of the League of Nations Covenant, which stipulates that all countries should reduce armaments to the lowest level consistent with their national security. However, he did not agree with certain points in the draft treaty. From this point of view, although the progress of the Disarmament Conference may not be completely hopeless, the debate will be very intense. Because the interests of the countries are different, and armaments are considered to be the life of the country, they are unwilling to give in rashly. Or, there are those who worry that the war may be inevitable in various countries before the Disarmament Conference is convened. This is an overly pessimistic statement, and I dare not believe it.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Japanese Diet Debate Criticizes Shidehara Diplomacy <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Weak negotiations with China and Russia</p>
<p>Opposing party adds insult to injury</p>
<p>Former Finance Minister Sanshi presses the government</p>
<p>House of Representatives in great chaos three times the day before yesterday</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Electric Communication) In the House of Representatives plenary session, which began debating the acting prime minister issue, questioning of the ministers of state began yesterday. First, former Finance Minister Sanshi took the podium and said: Since last year, the government has been optimistic about the future of the economic world, but the actual situation in the financial world is greatly contrary to the government's expectations, and the recession is deepening. The voices of resentment against the current cabinet are deafening among the people. (At that time, the opposition party applauded loudly and shouted "Enemy of the people.") Sanshi continued, saying: The reason for such a recession is entirely the result of the unprepared gold standard lifting. Japan is a country based on agriculture. If the price of rice and raw silk plummets, the purchasing power will decrease, causing the decline of commerce and industry. The government, while advocating to reduce prices and restrict production in order to reorganize enterprises, abused the silk price compensation law. Although it prevented the price of silk from falling, the result was a great loss to the people. What the government is doing disregards the interests of farmers and only supports the interests of a few financiers and capitalists. It is putting the cart before the horse, which is very strange. (At that time, the ruling party tried to interfere, and Speaker Fujisawa repeatedly called for silence.) Sanshi continued, saying: The government declared that the surplus from military reduction would be used to reduce taxes, but most of it was used to supplement the plan, and only a small amount was used to reduce taxes. What the government said was false propaganda, deceiving the people to the extreme. (At that time, the ruling party was furious and shouted for Sanshi to withdraw his slip of the tongue.) Speaker Fujisawa interjected, saying: Mr. Sanshi's speech seems to contain inappropriate words. The transcript will be investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Then Fujii and Fukazawa of the Seiyukai rushed to the Speaker's seat and slammed the table and cursed the secretary-general. The ruling party was also angry, and the whole party stood up. Yamada and Sakuda of the ruling party also rushed to the Speaker's seat and shouted for punishment. The Diet hall was in great chaos. Mr. Sanshi stood on the podium, unable to advance or retreat. Soon, Fukazawa and Fujii stepped down, and the Diet hall returned to calm. Sanshi began to continue his speech, saying: The government touted the non-borrowing policy, and realized the fallacy of its policy, and then issued railway bonds, and abused the issuance of various public bonds in the name of rescuing unemployment and various other names. This is nothing but a flaw in the current cabinet's public bond policy. He pointed to Finance Minister Inoue and spoke in a stern tone. Then he said to Navy Minister Ambo: After repeated disputes between the government and the Naval General Staff, the supplementary plan was established. However, is this plan safe for national defense? Will the future supplementary ship construction plan endanger the national treasury and finances? He asked questions for ten minutes and then stepped down from the podium. At that time, the ruling party submitted a motion to punish Fukazawa and Fujii, and the Diet hall fell into great chaos again. In the end, it was put to a vote by roll call. As a result, by an absolute majority, the two were handed over to the disciplinary committee. Next, Finance Minister Inoue took the podium to refute Sanshi's questions one by one. Finally, he said that Mr. Sanshi's estimate of revenue was too large. This is because the view of the financial situation is different. The subsequent argument was not very thorough, and the Seiyukai ridiculed him. Inoue then stepped down from the podium. Navy Minister Ambo took the podium to answer, his words were extremely simple, only saying that there was no need to worry about the supplementary plan at all. Sanshi took the podium again, saying that the fatigue of the rural areas is no greater than today. This is due to the government's policy failure. For example, the unemployment public bond is a metropolitan-biased doctrine, without considering the rural areas at all. He also said to Navy Minister Ambo: Is the national defense plan really worry-free? Inoue took the podium again, and when he was about to answer, Harajuku and Imai Takehiko of the Seiyukai rushed to the podium, but were stopped by the guards. Then, Yamato of the Kokumin Domei took the podium to question Finance Minister Inoue about the issue of excessive revenue estimates, the issue of illegal budget reorganization, and the issue of unemployment bonds. At that time, there were already many empty seats in the Diet hall, and an atmosphere of laziness was permeating. After Finance Minister Inoue answered one by one, Muto said that Mr. Inoue's answer can be said to be extremely irresponsible. (The following is a Jiji Press dispatch) Finally, Matsuoka of the Seiyukai took the podium to question the diplomatic issues. First, he attacked the government's inaction in diplomacy with Britain and the United States, and then criticized the weakness in negotiations with Russia and China, and the incompetence of the Manchuria-Mongolia policy. Acting Prime Minister Shidehara took the podium to answer, and members of the Seiyukai shouted "Traitor." Shidehara was unable to speak for a while, and the members then announced the adjournment.</p>

<p>Receiving Important Foreign Dispatches</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Electric Communication) Today's House of Representatives formal meeting opened at 1:15 p.m. First, Foreign Minister Shidehara replied to the questions of Matsuoka (Seiyukai) yesterday. At that time, the opposition party shouted "Traitor" again. The Diet hall was noisy from the beginning. Shidehara waited for the Diet hall to calm down slightly and then declared (the following is a Jiji Press dispatch): Mr. Matsuoka's accusation that the Nanjing Incident and the request by Ambassador Obata for the consent of the National Government are weak diplomacy is unfounded. The recent negotiations between the South Manchuria Railway Company and Zhang Xueliang are not a strategy to cover up for the Diet. Diplomacy can never be simply criticized or commented on with abstract terms such as weak or strong. Matsuoka then asked Shidehara to announce the reason and truth for Ambassador Obata's rejection by the National Government, and said that changing the name from Zhina Republic to the Republic of China is evidence of Foreign Minister Shidehara's weak diplomacy. After Shidehara's reply, Azuma of the Seiyukai took the podium to challenge the government's financial policy, and then touched on the rural issue, listing the tragic situations in various places and criticizing the government's poor rural countermeasures, and said that various financial accommodation only helped a part of the people, and the farmers did not get any benefits. Finally, Asahara Kenzo of the proletarian elite, the National Masses Party, took the podium and challenged the government on issues such as unemployment, political suppression, and rural fatigue from the standpoint of the proletariat. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Jiji Press: Today's House of Peers opened at 10:00 a.m. Takahashi of the Koyu Club took the podium and gave a lengthy speech on the derailment of the Sanyo Line train and other issues. The Diet hall lost its vitality.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Electric Communication) As a result of the disciplinary committee's deliberations, Members Fukazawa and Fujii were suspended from attending the Diet for one week.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: As a result of the consultations of the House of Representatives factions, it was decided that the questioning of the ministers of state would continue until the 27th. The 25th is Sunday and the meeting will be adjourned. The questioning will continue on the 26th. The questioning will end on the 27th, and the bills submitted by the government will be scheduled.</p>

<p>Centrist factions may succeed in forming a cabinet</p>
<p>Paris, 23rd (National Society) After President Doumergue summoned the speakers of the two houses and the leaders of the various parties to discuss the selection of the successor to the German Prime Minister today, it was temporarily believed that Senators Laval, Flandin, and Barthou were the most suitable. In addition, former Prime Minister Tardieu and Briand are in Geneva and are expected to return on Saturday. The current political situation is chaotic. It is expected that the Radical Party may not want to join the cabinet again, so the new cabinet will probably be based on the centrist factions, supplemented by the right wing.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Wuhan Garrison to Convene Another Conference on Pacification in Three Provinces <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>He Chengjun to Return to Hankou to Supervise Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the Wuhan Garrison convened a pacification conference regarding military bandit suppression in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, the armies of the three provinces have, according to plan, launched offensives on multiple fronts, eliminating many bandits over the past two months. However, on the 31st of last month, the 18th Division suffered a setback at Donggumen, causing bandit forces to reignite. Additionally, remnants of He and Kuang's bandit gangs in the border areas of Hunan and Hubei have taken the opportunity to cause disturbances. Those concerned about the bandit scourge in the three provinces are worried. Fortunately, Honghu, which had long been occupied by bandits, was captured by troops of the 10th Army, severing connections for He and Kuang's bandit forces. The armies of Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan were then able to encircle them. Furthermore, the Wugong Mountains on the borders of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi were destroyed by troops of the 9th Army, resulting in the on-site killing of several bandit leaders. Although the communist bandits in Jiangxi are relatively rampant, their connections with the bandits in Hunan and Hubei have been severed, and their strength has been greatly diminished after fierce battles with the 18th Division. If attacked again by crack troops, they can be wiped out in one fell swoop. He Chengjun, head of the Wuhan Garrison, in order to thoroughly eliminate the communist bandits, traveled from Hankou to Nanjing to pay respects to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, personally reporting on the situation of bandit suppression in the three provinces. He also indicated that since a garrison was also established in Nanchang, its scope of authority needed to be clarified with Commander-in-Chief Chiang. It is reported that after arriving in Nanjing, He, along with Tu Jin Yu, the superintendent for bandit suppression and rural pacification on the borders of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and Xia Douyin, the commander of the 21st Route Army, visited Chiang for several days, consulting on the outcome. Commander-in-Chief Chiang greatly appreciated He's new plan for bandit suppression and instructed He in person that all matters related to bandit suppression in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi should still be under the full command of the Wuhan Garrison, assigning him sole responsibility. After receiving the order, He plans to stay in Nanjing for a few more days before returning to Hankou to preside over affairs. Given that the strength of bandit forces in the three provinces changes daily, the methods of advancement and suppression must be carefully considered. He plans to convene another conference on pacification in the three provinces immediately after returning to Hankou, gathering the commanding officers of the bandit suppression forces from the three provinces, the chiefs of staff of each army, division, and brigade, personally inquiring about the latest bandit suppression situation, and providing instructions on new strategies. The period for complete suppression will still be in accordance with the deadline set by Commander-in-Chief Chiang: March 31st. Those who have not been completely suppressed by then will be punished. As for bandit suppression expenses, in Jiangxi Province, in addition to the original troops being paid by the provincial government, the remaining national army will be paid directly by the central government. In Hunan Province, because there are fewer guest troops, it is also easier to raise funds. However, in Hubei Province, after the downsizing, finances are extremely difficult, and there are several times more national troops stationed in Hubei than in Hunan. Previously, the provincial government decided to issue 3 million yuan in bandit suppression bonds, later renamed as post-war recovery bonds. The issuance regulations have been approved by the Ministry of Finance. The bonds are denominated in 1,000 yuan, 100 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan denominations, and are allocated to each county and city in the province. The Wuhan Banking Group is provisionally allocated 800,000 yuan, the two Wuhan business associations 500,000 yuan, the provincial government 300,000 yuan, each county 100,000 yuan, each city and town 270,000 yuan, and the remainder is allocated from Wuhan rental income. The funds raised from the issuance of these bonds will be used for bandit suppression expenses. (January 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Recent News on Bandit Suppression Divisions in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The 18th and 50th Divisions to Undergo Streamlining</p>
<p>Han Deqin Has Led His Division Headquarters to Nanchang</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Commander-in-Chief Chiang issued a clear order to temporarily postpone the streamlining of all bandit suppression units. However, the 18th and 50th Divisions suffered significant casualties in the recent bandit suppression campaigns in Longgang, Dongshao, and Zhongcun. They returned to the rear for reorganization and replenishment, hence taking this opportunity to undertake streamlining. It is learned that Tan Daoyuan's 50th Division had long received orders to be streamlined into a Class B division. This month, Division Commander Tan ordered his troops to gradually move from Yihuang and Bingfeng to Zhangshu to concentrate. The division was streamlined into two brigades with six regiments. Except for the 150th Brigade under Luo Shouyi, which was disbanded, the 148th Brigade under Cheng Guangyao and the 149th Brigade under Yue Sen (concurrently Deputy Division Commander) retained their original regimental, battalion, and company commanders, only changing their numbers. After the streamlining of the division is completed, they will intensify training in Zhangshu and request the central government to send personnel for inspection. After the inspection, they will advance to the front to suppress bandits. As for the 18th Division, it also received orders to reorganize according to the Class B division system, eliminating half. Except for Zhu Yaohua's 54th Brigade, which is still suppressing bandits at the front, the 52nd and 53rd Brigades have moved to Fengcheng Qingjiang to reorganize. It is reported that Acting Division Commander Xiao Wenduo has completed the reorganization of his unit according to the Class B system. The 53rd Brigade was disbanded, and the 105th and 106th Regiments under that brigade were incorporated into the 101st and 102nd Regiments of the 52nd Brigade, with Dai Yue and Zhu Yaohua continuing to serve as brigade commanders. Many lower-ranking officers have been transferred and replaced, and requests for replenishment of firearms have been submitted to the headquarters.</p>
<p>After arriving in Nanchang, Han Deqin's 52nd Division moved to the upper reaches of the Gan River. Division Commander Han Deqin, along with Deputy Division Commander Tu and Chief of Staff Luo, led the division headquarters and directly subordinate units from Xun to the province on the evening of the 20th. The division headquarters was set up at the Gao Sheng Lane Law and Politics Special School. On the afternoon of the 22nd, the provincial government hosted a banquet at the West Flower Hall to welcome Han and other senior officers, expressing their appreciation. It is heard that Han will soon lead his division headquarters to the upper reaches of the Gan River, commanding his troops to strive for the complete elimination of communist bandits.

<h3 id="e75">Communist Bandits Occupy Huarong Three Times <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Since He Long fled from western Hubei into western Hunan, only three months have passed, but he has repeatedly harassed the counties of Nanhua, Jinshi, Li, and Lin in Hunan, and Gongshi and Songhe in Hubei. Huarong County has fallen twice. In the middle of last month, Li Ming, the brigade commander of the 32nd Brigade of the 11th Division, rushed from Yuezhou to recover it. In the period of a little over a month, although Li's brigade recovered the county seat of Huarong, the four rural areas of Huarong have become bandit-controlled. Duan Dechang's force of 3,000 to 4,000 communist bandits has dispersed and remained hidden in the villages and lakes of Shizui and Diaoxian in Huarong. Recently, Li's brigade received orders from Division Commander Chen Cheng to return to Yuezhou for reorganization. According to the central government's designated area-based bandit suppression plan, it should have been taken over by Xiao Zhichu's 44th Division. However, because Xiao's division was still suppressing bandits in southern Hubei, it was unable to arrive immediately. Zeng Jingshan, the magistrate of Huarong County, repeatedly telegraphed the province, reporting the rampant bandit situation and requesting that Li's brigade be temporarily stationed. If Li's brigade could not stay in the county and Xiao's division could not take over, he requested that Division Commander Li Jue of the 19th Division send troops to take over to avoid negligence. Unexpectedly, Li's brigade, eager to reorganize, completely withdrew to Yuezhou on the 16th. Li's division was also suppressing He Long in the Lizhou area and could not dispatch troops to Huarong for relief. The county seat was empty, and the county magistrate, being timid, dared not stay and left the city with the troops on the 16th, temporarily moving the county government to Beijinggang. Before leaving, he sent a telegram saying: "The troops stationed in the county were completely withdrawn this morning. The relief troops are not expected to arrive. The public is panic-stricken, and order is disrupted. An emergency meeting was called, and it was unanimously stated that the defense is empty, the bandit situation is vast, and it is difficult to resist with the remaining local defense forces with limited ammunition. It is advisable to temporarily retreat to Beijinggang for office work. Although I have a responsibility to defend the territory, I am helpless. I have no choice but to follow the public opinion. Once the troops have completely withdrawn, I will order the local defense forces to concentrate, on the one hand, supporting the people to evacuate to safety, and on the other hand, supervising the teams to block and intercept. In case of a disparity in strength, I will retreat again. I implore you to quickly order Division Commander Li Jue to dispatch troops for assistance, which may provide some remedy. Otherwise, Huarong will fall for the third time, and the people will suffer unimaginable hardships. I urgently submit my words, filled with anxiety and awaiting orders. Zeng Jingshan, the magistrate of Huarong County, bows." Upon receiving the report, He Jian immediately telegraphed the two divisions of Li Jue and Zhang Ying, ordering them to quickly dispatch troops for assistance. However, it was too late. Duan Dechang led his troops to attack in three directions on the afternoon of the 16th and arrived at the county seat of Huarong early on the 17th. At that time, the troops and local defense forces had already retreated completely. Duan's bandits captured it effortlessly. The third fall of Huarong has shaken Nanxian and Yuanjiang, which have telegraphed the province for emergency assistance. The telegram from Nanxian stated: "Li's brigade in Huarong emptied the defense on the day before yesterday and was captured at dawn. The affiliated counties are in imminent danger. In addition to working with the military to do our best to block, we urgently request the dispatch of a large army for assistance to save the crisis. Tan Renwei, the magistrate of Nanxian, bows." The telegram from Yuanjiang stated: "According to reports, the majority of Duan's bandits launched a three-pronged attack on Huarong at noon the day before yesterday and captured the county seat at dawn. Lianyu Wharf has also fallen. Magistrate Zeng retreated with the 11th Division to Yueyang. The bandits have reached Shakou. The local defense forces of Huarong have retreated to the Wupo Diaoyuzui area. The garrison in Nanxian is guarding the county river mouth five miles from the county seat of Nanxian. The affiliated counties have dispatched teams to block the area near Babai Gong. Please quickly send a large army for assistance and suppression. Fang Xin, the magistrate of Yuanjiang, bows."</p>
<p>It is heard that after occupying Huarong on the 17th, Duan's bandits launched a three-pronged attack on Nanxian on the 19th. Fortunately, Zhang Ying's Sichuan army had dispatched two regiments, Duan and Zhou, to block the river at Hongyangzha, so the bandits failed to cross the river. In addition, Division Commander Li Jue also dispatched two regiments for assistance, requiring them to concentrate in Nanhua before the 21st. Once the assembly is complete, they will launch a general attack on Huarong. According to He Jian's report at the provincial government memorial week on the 19th, he stated that the county could be recovered soon. However, the people have once again suffered devastation.

<h3 id="e76">Key Hunan Communist Leader Yang Youlin Captured <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Yang Youlin, a key communist leader in Hunan Province, was originally a middle school student from Xiangxiang County. In 1924, he joined the Communist Party and implemented communist work. In 1926, when the Communist Party was in power in Hunan, Yang served as a member of the Provincial Farmers' Association Executive Committee, manipulating the provincial farmers' movement, organizing peasant self-defense forces, instigating riots, confiscating property, and brutally killing countless innocent people. In 1927, after the May Incident, Yang fled to the Ping-Liu area with Yi Lirong and Dai Yuan, disappearing without a trace. On July 27th of last year, when the communist bandit Peng Dehuai captured Changsha, Yang returned to the province and served as a member of the puppet Soviet Hunan Provincial Government, issuing orders and directing riots. Because Yang had lived in the province for a long time, he was very familiar with the situation in Changsha. He knew which families were well-off and which were wealthy merchants, and he assigned red bandits to capture, kill, loot, and plunder. Even middle-class families suffered greatly, so the citizens of Changsha hate Yang to the bone. After the recovery of the provincial capital, Yang also fled without a trace. Unexpectedly, he recently returned to his hometown in Xiangxiang with orders from the Communist Party, preparing to mobilize the local defense forces and ignorant people in Xiangxiang to join the Communist Party and take the opportunity to create chaos. Fortunately, the Xiangxiang County neighborhood watch forces detected this and secretly dispatched 20 soldiers on the evening of the 18th to surround Yang's residence, capturing him on the spot. They also found plans and resolutions for communist sabotage in Hunan in his home. Yang was handed over to the Xiangxiang County Government. County Magistrate Tian Jifeng proposed a strict interrogation. Yang denied being Yang Youlin, claiming that his name was Yang Zailin and that he was Yang Youlin's cousin, merely living in the same house. However, many people in Xiangxiang confirmed that he was definitely Yang Youlin and requested his execution to prevent him from escaping justice. Upon receiving the report, He Jian ordered the Xiangxiang County Government to hand over Yang to the provincial government for interrogation soon. (January 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Yang Shuzhuang Returns to Fujian from Shanghai <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Immediately Convening Provincial Committee to Discuss Military and Post-War Matters</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Yang Shuzhuang, chairman of the provincial government, recently went to Nanjing upon orders. Now, because the financial problems of Fujian Province have been discussed and a solution has been found, and the provincial situation urgently needs to be resolved, he returned to Fujian on the 18th from Shanghai aboard the Pu'an transport ship with Zheng Baoqing, Yang Sui, Wu Shu, and Shi Jialin. He entered the port on the morning of the 20th and returned to the provincial government in the afternoon. Yang's return to Fujian has four major tasks: (1) strengthening the provincial government organization; (2) reorganizing local finances; (3) eliminating communist bandits on the Fujian border; and (4) reorganizing the provincial defense forces. On the 21st, Yang convened a temporary meeting of the provincial government committee. Regarding military and post-war matters, it was decided to abolish the Temporary Military Affairs Office and establish a Security Office, with Fang Shengtao as the director. All provincial defense forces, provincial police, guerrilla teams, and advance teams will be handed over to this office for reorganization. Fang has scheduled to go to southern Fujian within a week to inspect the troops of Chen Guohui, Gao Jingli, Liang Jichuan, and Huang Bingwu, and to divide the defense areas. After the procedures are completed, he will return to the province to organize the Security Office. Furthermore, the temporary meeting of the provincial government decided that the three units currently stationed in northern Fujian, Liu Heding's division, Zhou Ziqun's brigade, and Zhang Ziming's brigade, will be ordered to move to Jiangxi Province to join the Sixth Route Army in attacking communist bandits. Currently, the vanguard unit of Liu Shangzhi's brigade of Liu's division has arrived in Ningdu on the Jiangxi border. The two brigades of Chen Wantai and Gui Zhenyuan are also advancing towards Jiangle Guihua Jianning. Zhou Ziqun's brigade has arrived in Ninghua on the Fujian border, and Zhang Ziming's brigade has also arrived in Tai Ning on the Fujian border. They are expected to all enter Jiangxi within ten days. Liu Heding telegraphed the provincial government, reporting the situation of departure and requesting the dispatch of troops to take over defense in the counties on the Fujian border. The provincial government also decided to order the three brigade units of Lu Xingbang, Qian Yuguang, and Lin Bingzhou, currently stationed in Yongan Jianyang Jianou, to be responsible for deployment. Regarding financial issues, it was decided to implement a business tax to supplement funds. Once the Ministry of Finance issues the tax regulations, the Finance Department will prepare to implement it. (January 21st)</p>

Furthermore, it is learned that Lu Xingrong was killed in Yongan by Zhou Ziqun's troops. Upon hearing the news, Lu Xingbang secretly returned to Youxi. However, as of today (20th), the provincial government and the martial law headquarters have not received an official report. (January 20th)</p>

<p>To Meet Zhang Xueliang in Shenyang Before Proceeding to Nanjing</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Mo Dehui's trip to Nanjing has been changed several times. It was initially scheduled for the 9th, then changed to the 12th, both due to Zhang Xueliang's delay in Tianjin and repeated postponements. On the afternoon of the 18th, Mo received news that Zhang had returned to Shenyang and decided to depart south at 10:45 pm. Mo felt it was necessary to report the progress of the Sino-Soviet conference to the Northeast authorities first, so he could not leave until he met Zhang in person. This trip to Liaoning will last about a week, after which he will proceed to Nanjing. Initially, he had arranged with Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting to meet in Tianjin and travel to Nanjing together. However, since Wang could not stay in Tianjin for long, they changed the meeting to Nanjing. Mo's skin disease has improved slightly, but his neurasthenia has not diminished. After receiving instructions in Nanjing, he plans to return to Liaoning by sea from Shanghai. When passing through Dalian, he will bathe in the Tanggangzi hot springs for several days to recuperate before returning to Harbin. He plans to request an extension of his one-month vacation upon meeting Foreign Minister Wang in Nanjing. When Mo left Harbin on the evening of the 18th, people from all walks of life in Harbin came to the station to see him off. The Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) also provided him with a first-class official car. His entourage included Zhang Mingzhe, director of the CER Audit Bureau, Uzesheng, director of the CER Library, Wang Zhaoquan, secretary of the CER Board of Directors, and telecommunications officer Zi Jingchang. The day before departure, the Liaoning industrial and commercial groups telegraphed a welcome, so a grand scene is expected upon his arrival in Liaoning. As for the Sino-Soviet conference, it has been temporarily suspended after Mo's return to the country. Special Committee Member Li Chen, who has lived abroad for a long time and is suffering from a serious illness, has requested leave and returned to the country with Wen Ming, a member of the delegation. They are expected to arrive in Harbin around the 24th or 25th. (January 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Second Trial of the Judge Ha Murder Case <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Victim Zhang Wang Liqing Appears in Court</p>
<p>Testimony Offering Exoneration for Ye Yixiong</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The case of Ye Yixiong shooting his mistress Zhang Wang Liqing continued its hearing at the Binjiang Court this afternoon (19th) at 2:30 PM. Since the last public hearing, the public's interest in this case has only grown. Dozens have gone to the court daily to seek to continue hearing the trial. Yesterday, news of the continued hearing was received, and knowing that the female protagonist Zhang Wang Liqing was determined to appear, driven by curiosity, everyone hurried to attend the hearing. By 11:00 AM, many people were arriving one after another. Fearing rejection by the court, many pretended to be journalists. By 2:00 PM, more than a hundred men and women had arrived. The court specially opened a large living room to accommodate the audience as a temporary resting room. Court President Guo Yilin stated that the number of attendees broke the court's existing record. He bustled about in the courtroom, directing bailiffs and arranging seats. The first criminal court was larger, so it was converted into a courtroom, but ultimately, due to the small room and many people, there were only forty seats in the audience, requiring much arrangement. The trial was originally scheduled to begin at 2:00 PM, but due to the victim Zhang Wang Liqing's absence, it was delayed until 2:35 PM. Zhang Wang Liqing arrived at the court by car at 2:25 PM, accompanied by her lawyer, Chi Long. When Zhang alighted from the car, the audience crowded into the courtyard to see her. Those who did not get a good look followed her to the bailiff's room where she was resting, peering through the doorway to catch a glimpse. Zhang wore a blue satin fox fur-trimmed cape, a yellow felt hat, and blue velvet boots. She walked with light, healthy steps, displaying a composed demeanor. However, her face still showed signs of illness. When the trial began at 2:35 PM, the audience rushed to their seats. Those who were quick managed to secure seats, while those who could not find seats crowded at the doorway, clamoring incessantly. In the end, the court president had no choice but to make a special concession, allowing dozens of audience members to ascend the platform and stand next to the judge's bench, resembling the constables in the old-fashioned yamen. After the trial began, many people continued to arrive, knocking on the courtroom door and begging to be let in. Several bailiffs stood inside and outside the door, strictly preventing unauthorized entry. Therefore, the sounds of knocking and arguing were constantly heard. Those who could not enter the courtroom could only gaze longingly at the doorway and sigh. However, many did not want to make the trip in vain, enduring the cold and standing in the courtyard, waiting for a glimpse of Zhang Wang Liqing's face. Only after the court was adjourned and Zhang Wang Liqing left the court with her lawyer did the crowd disperse. It is rumored that this case will have a third trial in a week, after all the witnesses have been summoned. Because Ye and Zhang's testimonies have been repeatedly reversed, whether Ye is guilty depends on the witnesses' testimonies at the next trial. The details of today's trial are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>First, Ye Yixiong was questioned. Ye originally had shackles on his feet. The court, seeing that there were too many audience members, which was unseemly, temporarily removed the restraints. Judge (Question): Ye Yixiong, when did you buy your handgun? Ye (Answer): Winter of the 11th year. I don't remember the date. I was studying at the Russian school at the time. My classmate surnamed Rui knows about it. (Question): Where did you buy it? (Answer): At the gun shop on 14th Street of China Avenue. (Question): Did you obtain a gun license? (Answer): I had one before. (Question): Where is the gun license now? (Answer): I don't remember. It's been eight or nine years, and I have two homes, so I don't know where it is. (Question): Do you remember the gun license number? (Answer): The number has too many digits. I don't remember it now. (Question): You said your classmate surnamed Rui knows about the gun purchase. What is his name? (Answer): Rui Youban. We are old classmates and have been friends for seven years. (Question): What is his occupation? (Answer): Formerly the section chief of the Education Department. (Question): Is it the Education Department of the Special District? (Answer): Yes. (Question): Where does he live? (Answer): I don't remember his address. When my lawyer meets with me, I can ask him to inquire. Also, last time I didn't have time to say many things. Please allow me to speak, Judge. When I was at Shuangcheng Station, all the paper and the chop were not searched out. At that time, there was a patrol chief and two policemen in the room. I took them out myself and handed them over. (Question): You can't remember your gun license number. After you shot her, where did you throw the gun? (Answer): After the incident, I ran to the side. When I fell, the snow was very deep, and the gun fell into the snow. Because the snow was very deep, I couldn't find it. I didn't throw it. (Question): Your original statement said that after you committed the murder, you didn't walk far. There was a small grove, resembling a park. The snow was very deep, and you threw the gun there. How can you say it fell? (Answer): I didn't throw it. It fell. (Question): After firing a shot, did you search her body? Did you find anything? (Answer): The snow was very deep. I was only concerned with running. She was crying and shouting. How could I dare search her? (Question): The remittance of 7,050 yuan, remitted from your hand to Beiping, who would pick it up in Beiping? (Answer): It wasn't decided. There are many procedures for withdrawing the money. (Question): Do you need a guarantor to withdraw the money in Beiping? Is it paid without a guarantor, or is it withdrawn with a stamp? (Answer): I don't know the details. You'll only know when you withdraw the money in Beiping. (Question): When will you know? (Answer): I don't know about the money. (Question): On the 23rd, where did you travel to by train? You needed the key to open the box before you saw the letter with the mooncake drawing? (Answer): At the time, I didn't know where I was going, because it was too hot inside the train. I was wearing two pairs of woolen trousers, which was too much. I wanted to change trousers, but since I didn't bring any luggage, I planned to take one pair off and put it in Ms. Zhang's box. Just then, Ms. Zhang wanted a cigarette and gave me the key. Why didn't I change my trousers? Because when I opened the box, I saw the letter and got angry and didn't change them. Last time, the judge asked if I cried or cursed. I really didn't. And there are many things that happened that I didn't say last time because I was short on time. Please allow me to recount them. At the time, after I saw the letter, I was very angry. I thought, unless I give her a shot, or she gives me a shot, that's the end of it. So, the more I thought about it, the angrier I got, seeing that letter from her giving Ke Long a drawing. Of course, she was going to Beiping to marry him. Before long, the train station arrived. At this time, I thought, if she goes to Beiping, I really don't want her to. How can I stop her from going? So, I said that there are good views in this place, tricking her into getting off the train. Actually, the train stopped for seven minutes. I said sixty minutes. After getting off the train, we walked west away from the station. As we walked, Ms. Zhang said she was afraid of bandits and wasn't satisfied with me. I thought, forget it. We've had a good relationship for over a year. I can't bear to hurt her. But I also wanted to persuade her to return to Harbin, but she didn't want to. So, I was very sad. As we walked, the train left. Ms. Zhang saw the train leaving and was even more unwilling. So, she grumbled. As we got close to the warehouse, her voice grew louder, and she began to quarrel. I thought, she's even more set on that thing in the letter. At this time, Ms. Zhang cursed me, "You're nothing. Who would want to go with you?" I said, "Good sister, you decide. You don't want to go with me. Do you want to go with Liu Ke Long?" She said, "I'll go with Liu Ke Long. It's none of your business." As we walked, Ms. Zhang slipped on the snow and fell. At this time, I was very angry and gave her a shot. I didn't expect it to happen. I really didn't expect that ten years of studying, my entire career, and reputation would be lost. As Ye recounted to this point, his voice was faint and filled with sorrow. His eyes were full of tears. The judge then said, (Question): Ye Yixiong, what you just said contradicts what you said last time, that you tricked Zhang Liqing off the train and walked past the water building, from the first warehouse to the second warehouse, across the light rail, to Shouzi Tomb, saying that the road was difficult to walk. You even helped Zhang Liqing walk, and she was crying and cursing, but you were smiling and saying, "Good sister, let's go." Today, you say you were pondering this and pondering that, starting to want to kill her, then not wanting to kill her, and finally killing her. According to you,</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Today, you also say that Zhang wanted to marry Liu Ke Long, the letter had a mooncake on it, inviting him to eat mooncakes, and she cursed you, which made you angry enough to kill her. What you have said today contradicts what you said last time. You know that changing your story only makes things worse. It's better to just be direct and tell the truth. (Answer): What I said last time was because I had been detained for dozens of days. It's been a long time, and I didn't think of everything. Actually, that's how the event unfolded. (Question): When you opened the box to see the letter, where had the train travelled to? How far was it from Shuangcheng? (Answer): At first, I didn't know where we were going. As we walked, the train slowed down, and I knew we were arriving at a station. (Question): Exactly how much time passed between opening the box and arriving at Shuangcheng? (Answer): Not much time. (Question): Three or four minutes? (Answer): I don't remember. (Question): What was written in that mooncake letter? (Answer): A mess. I couldn't see it clearly. I couldn't remember everything. There were words like "The Mid-Autumn Festival has arrived. Please eat a mooncake." Underneath, there was a drawing of a mooncake. Next to it, it was written, "This mooncake is almost to your mouth." Underneath, it was written, "Want to be with you..." dots. (Question): How many letters did you see before you saw this letter? (Answer): I just flipped through them. When I saw that this letter was important, I looked at it. (Question): Did you not see anything else? (Answer): There were also family letters, for Zhang's family. There were many. Because they were family letters, it is not good to read other people's letters, so I didn't read them. There were many other letters. I don't remember them. (Question): What did the letter you said you saw say? (Answer): It said, "The Mid-Autumn Festival has arrived. Please eat a mooncake." I don't remember the details. (Question): How many pages was that letter? (Answer): I don't remember. The mooncake in the letter was drawn on the left side of one page, near the end of where it was written. I don't know how many pages. (Question): Did you read the entire letter? (Answer): I skimmed it. (Question): What kind of pen was it written with? (Answer): It was probably written with a fountain pen. I don't remember. (Question): After you opened the box, did you return the key? (Answer): After opening the box, I hung the key there. Ms. Zhang came in at this time. I quickly closed it and took the key, putting it casually in my pocket. I was wearing a Zhongshan suit with four pockets. I casually put it down. I felt very ashamed for reading other people's letters. Ms. Zhang saw that my complexion was not good, so she left. (Question): After you shot her, did you touch anything on her body? (Answer): I didn't touch anything. I was already feeling bad, and I was in a hurry. How could I touch her body? (Question): According to what you say, after you shot her, you hid away, and you didn't touch anything on her body. (Answer): She was yelling and screaming. How could I touch anything? The judge ordered Zhang Wang Liqing to be brought in. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Difficult to Abolish Additional Tax on Anhui Salt <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Defense Military Expenses Have No Way to Be Subsidized</p>
<p>The financial difficulties of Anhui Province have a long history. After the separation of the Provincial Finance Department and the Special Finance Office last year, the Likin tax was allocated as central revenue. The provincial treasury only relied on the land and head tax and miscellaneous taxes of various counties for subsidies, and the shortfall between income and expenditure has increased significantly. This time, the abolition of the Likin tax has been particularly exhausting. The provincial government decided to levy an additional tax on salt per jin, 2.4 yuan per shi, as compensation. Recently, the Ministry of Finance, based on petitions from the people of 21 counties in northern Anhui, telegraphed the provincial government to abolish this additional tax. The provincial government stated that the provincial defense military expenses relied on this subsidy and that there were no other funds to raise. Yesterday, it specially replied to the Ministry of Finance, detailing the difficult situation, stating that the Ministry had approved a cable stating that the Bengbu Huai Salt Merchants Association and other groups, as well as the representatives of the people of 21 counties in northern Anhui, including Peng Zhuoru, had telegraphed one after another, stating that the provincial government had set up bureaus in Bengbu and Tunxi, adding additional taxes on salt, requesting a prompt telegram to stop them. The cable also instructed to follow the previous cable to abolish them. This case had previously been approved by the Ministry's 30th cable, stating that Anhui citizen Li Yongbin and others had telegraphed the same situation, instructing that it be abolished. It had already been consulted and replied to the government. The provincial government believes that Anhui's finances are at their extreme. All situations are well known to the Ministry. Currently, the provincial defense military expenses are more than 2.7 million yuan, and there is really no way to subsidize them. There is absolutely no other way to compensate except by promoting the additional tax on salt. Anhui Province obeys the central government's orders and does not dare to have its own separate policies. The difficult situation and expedient measures must also be understood by the Ministry. In the future, when the communist bandits are eliminated and the local area is peaceful, this additional tax should be abolished at any time. As for the issue of smuggled salt being flooded in, both northern and southern Anhui have special smuggling bureaus, and inspections are very serious. There is no need to worry about it being flooded in and circumventing. The previous reasons for the cable, in addition to having been submitted to the Executive Yuan for filing, are appropriately consulted and replied to, and request review.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Jiangsu Province Prepares for Spring Afforestation <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines has designated the anniversary of the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen on March 12th of this year as the date for tree planting.

<p>Accused of Theft, Suicide Saved: Zhang Yixian, a farmer in Huinong Township in the county, had his fence destroyed by thieves the other night, who entered and stole items. When this was discovered, the security corps of the township was notified and arrested the thief. The township head, Gu Xiuzhang, interrogated him. According to his confession, his name was Cao Laosan, a native of the township, and he falsely accused Chen Yezi from the neighboring township (West Seventh Township) of being a lookout. The township head immediately arrested Chen Yezi, forced him to write a letter of repentance, and demanded 27 yuan to avoid prosecution. Although Chen Xiangsheng testified that Chen Yezi had always been law-abiding, it was to no avail. Under the pressure of accumulated authority, Chen had no choice but to reluctantly agree. However, he later realized that he was greatly humiliated and had no face to show anyone. So, last night, he obtained several doses of opium and swallowed them in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, he was discovered by villagers, who treated him in various ways and saved him from danger.</p>
<p>Water Police Cracked Many Theft Cases: The Fourth Brigade of the Water Police Provincial Public Security Team stationed in Datuan has recently been dispatching police to investigate bandit traces due to the winter defense emergency. A few days ago, they arrested Song Tanggui and his brother A Shu at Shenjia Pier. Tanggui confessed to repeatedly committing robbery cases and admitted to robbing Tang Songlin's family recently. Xu Miaoquan was also arrested at Central Bridge, who confessed to joining Shen Ayou and others in robbing Deng Tailai's store at Xuanjia Bridge and joining the Communist Party. It is reported that these bandits have now been sent to the Nanhui County Government for prosecution.</p>

<p>Education Bureau Abolishes Lunar New Year and Conducts Inspections of Schools: The Education Bureau previously decided at a bureau affairs meeting to abolish Lunar New Year and communicated this to all schools and social education institutions, ordering that no holidays be granted. Fearing that the order would be obeyed superficially but violated in reality, the 66th bureau affairs meeting stipulated that personnel would be sent to investigate in three districts from February 13th to 27th, inspecting no less than one-third of the schools. Those who did not comply with the law would be severely punished. Hu's Wife Murder Case Court Hearing Record: Hu Yinglong of Da Wuqiao was prosecuted for the murder of his wife, and his stepmother, Hu Nie, was prosecuted for assisting in the murder. The Criminal Court of the court held a public trial on the afternoon of the 22nd. This case attracted much attention, and the audience was very crowded, making it impossible to conduct the trial. Therefore, the court dismissed the corpse brother Zhang Zeqian and others and rescheduled the hearing for 9:00 AM this morning (24th). Criminal Court Judge Li and Prosecutor Ren and Secretary Li took their seats in the courtroom. The defendant's lawyers Zhang Baopei and Gu Shouyi, the witnesses Zhang Shaoxiu, physician, Tao, forensic examiner, and Zhu, as well as the plaintiff and defendant, were all present awaiting trial. The audience was still very crowded, but the order was good. After the informer Zhang Zeqian made his statement, the forensic examiner Tao was questioned, who stated that the examination of the corpse revealed finger marks on the neck, so it was determined that it was a strangulation injury. Lawyers Zhang and Gu selectively questioned this. Then, Dr. Zhang Shaoxiu made a statement (Dr. Zhang was hired by the informer to inspect the scene), saying that the death was caused by suffocation, and there was much debate. Later, Zhu Qia'an testified that Hu Yinglong had suffered from neurasthenia since childhood and had always been well-behaved, so he would not have caused this tragedy. At this point in the questioning, it was past noon, and the judge ordered a 40-minute recess, and then continued the questioning at 8:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Suzhou <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Five Children Kidnapped in Zhouzhuang Township: In Guojia Dian, Zhouzhuang Town in the county, the home of villager Xu Zhaolin was suddenly broken into by more than a dozen bandits at around 1:00 AM yesterday, who kidnapped three of Xu's sons and one son and one grandson of neighbor Shen Kunxiang.

<p>Tragic Boat Capsizing in Baiyang Bay: Qian Husheng and his younger brother Baosheng, along with their 12-year-old son, were returning to their village from the city by boat on the night before last (23rd). Also on board was Li Wu, a 65-year-old neighbor. As they sailed about two or three li from Tiger Hill into Baiyang Bay Lake, a sudden gale arose, and it was dark. There was no response to their cries for help, causing the boat to capsize. All four people on board drowned. Yesterday, Li Wu's son Tianbao and Husheng's mother Lu arrived at the scene to recover the bodies and filed a report with the District Attorney's Office to allow them to be taken away without examination.</p>
<p>Bandits Rampant Between Suzhou and Wujiang: In Xinta near Luhu in Wujiang County, five or six large bandit ships were discovered the night before last (23rd). The number of people was unknown due to the darkness. Upon receiving the report, the Third District of the Suzhou Water Police immediately dispatched the warships Peirong and Anjing, led by District Chief Shen Gaochan, as well as several teacher ships, to suppress them at 2:00 AM yesterday (24th). At the same time, it was reported that 50 or 60 bandit ships were discovered at Langda Temple in Dangjiao, the border between Suzhou and Changshu. Shen sent the first squad of the eleventh team, together with Yang Qingjiu, the team leader of the thirteenth team stationed in Changshu, to suppress them. Also, at Chenhua Wharf in Chefang, Suzhou Township, four bandit ships carrying more than a hundred bandits arrived at 10:00 AM yesterday (24th) and kidnapped Zhou Banghua, a clerk from the Xiangchun Nanhuo store in the town. The security corps of Chefang, Jiaozhi, and Xietang joined forces to pursue them. Upon hearing the news, Team Leader Pei of the Eleventh Water Police Team continued to assist in the suppression. Also, at Guojia Dian in Zhouzhuang, one bandit ship arrived at 2:00 AM yesterday (24th) and kidnapped three sons of villager Xu Zhaolin and one son and one grandson of Shen Kunxiang, heading towards Taihu Lake.

<p>Shanghai Kidnappers Capture Famous Kidnapper Shen Xiaohuzi (Jiangbei Native): Shen Xiaohuzi, who had been colluding with others to kidnap and extort huge sums of money in the Shanghai area, recently fled to Wuxi, hiding near the Student Silk Factory outside Guangfu Gate on Dongxin Road. The Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau learned of this and immediately dispatched detectives to Wuxi yesterday to cooperate with the county police team in the arrest. They captured the bandit Shen Xiaohuzi (the suspect is only in his twenties) in a teahouse next to the Housheng Silk Factory. The team temporarily detained him, awaiting official documents to be sent to Wuxi for his case to be heard and dealt with.</p>
<p>Liyang: Robbery and Disturbances in Townships: Since Liyang suffered successive bandit attacks the year before last, the government has taken strict precautions, and the villagers have become like startled birds. Late one night, more than ten bandits suddenly appeared in Qilicun, a place seven miles outside the north gate. Each carried firearms and planned to rob the village's residents. They first entered a certain family's home and only managed to rob several dozen silver dollars and a few gold rings. Just as they were about to continue robbing another family, a neighbor sounded the alarm. Soon, nearby militia and police teams rushed to surround and capture the bandits, who then fled with their stolen goods. The urban public security bureau also received the news, but without knowing the true situation, immediately dispatched police to the countryside to encircle and capture them. The city gates were immediately closed, and travelers passing through were strictly interrogated. After about two hours, things returned to normal. At that time, a steamship from Wuxi to Liyang had arrived in the wilderness about ten miles from the city. Receiving the alarm and faintly hearing gunfire, it stopped proceeding. Only after learning that the bandits had disappeared did it start sailing to Liyang, but the passengers had already suffered a scare. Furthermore, Zhuxiang reported another robbery case. Zhu Xinsan, a resident of Zhangjing Bridge Lane in the Seventh District of Huai’an, owned a modest amount of farmland. His son, Shuigen, is currently a teacher at a university in Shanghai. Recently, Zhu Xinsan built six or seven new-style Western-style houses next to his old house, which unfortunately attracted the attention of bandits. At around ten o'clock on the night before last, four robbers, speaking with northern accents and wielding weapons, suddenly arrived, opened the gate, and one bandit stood guard outside while three bandits entered to rob. Zhu Xinsan, seeing the bandits coming to rob, immediately escaped through the back door. His wife, née Bao, came out to negotiate with the bandits and handed over 227 silver dollars. The bandits, not satisfied with what they received, then arbitrarily searched the room of Zhu's wife, née Bao. After about an hour, they left with their stolen goods. In this incident, a total of three gold rings, one pair of gold bracelets, one gold lock pendant, one gold chain, and silver ornaments and clothing were robbed, with a total loss of more than 700 dollars.</p>

<p>Four Families Robbed in One Night in the Seventh District: Nanhudang in the Seventh District of this county, with its branching harbors, also borders Wuxi. On the night of the 21st, four families were robbed in the Lijiajiao area of Liulitang. It is reported that the bandits numbered about twenty to forty people. After landing from Huadang, they first went to the home of Wei Genggen in Jixiang of Ximajing, Liulitang, and broke into the house. They first fired two shots from a local musket, and then beat anyone they encountered. Genggen's mother, née Xu, was injured by the bandits with wooden sticks, and the hairpins on her bun were also snatched away. Genggen was forced to hand over silver dollars but could not produce them, and was also tortured and bruised. As a result, more than twenty piculs of white rice, more than ten chickens, more than fifty silver dollars, and jewelry, totaling about more than 400 dollars, were robbed. After the robbery, they went to the homes of Li Jinfu, Li Guangen, and Li Tongtong in Lijiajiao to rob, resulting in the theft of silver dollars, white rice, clothing, etc., totaling about more than 600 dollars. Then, they wandered around Tangbei, shining electric torches brightly. The villagers sounded the alarm, but the bandits still did not retreat. Later, they fired several shots before scattering. According to subsequent speculation, there may be clues to this robbery. Several peddlers from Jiangbei selling small books and dredging river mud arrived in the town last month, which is quite suspicious.</p>
<p>Kun-Chang Early Steamship to Resume Service Soon: Due to a dispute over route rights between the Huitong Company and the Tai Dong Lou Qin Chang Qing Joint Company regarding the additional Kun-Chang early steamship service, both sides suspended service pending resolution. Now, upon receiving an order from the department, the three joint companies, not having registered, were specifically ordered to suspend the Kun-Chang route, allowing the Huitong Bureau to operate the route. Orders have already been issued to both Kunshan and Changshu counties to comply. It is expected that the Kun-Chang early steamship service will resume soon.</p>

Yin arrived at Yuantong Nunnery and questioned Huang Gengmei, who claimed that on the afternoon of the 15th of this month, at 7 p.m., two or three people came to the temple to burn incense, followed by more than ten people who also came to burn incense. Suddenly, gunshots were heard outside the nunnery, and members of the Big Knife Team and county police entered, arresting more than ten people and beheading one. The deceased was named Chen Songlin, a native of Wujin, with injuries on his hands and feet. Chen had served as a detective for the Longhutang Security Team in Wujin and was known to be restless. The fourteen people arrested were also not good people. Huang also stated that he was not a member of the temple staff, but a carpenter, and that a member of the temple staff had been stabbed three times and was unable to come to the bureau. After questioning, Huang was to be sent to the county for further questioning.</p>

<p>Strict Punishment for Dishonest Public Servants: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs recently approved an official letter from Cao Minghuan, a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee, stating that according to comrades from Tonghai and other counties, dishonest district chiefs and security team leaders in Nantong, Haimen, Rugao, Taixing, Jingjiang, and other places often extorted money from good citizens in the name of eliminating reactionaries, accusing them of being communists, releasing them after receiving bribes, and killing those who did not pay. Furthermore, when genuine communist elements were captured, they were allowed to confess after receiving bribes. Such situations urgently needed to be corrected. It was requested that the provincial government strictly order the county governments to stop such unfortunate incidents from occurring. District chiefs and security team leaders, being public servants close to the people, should maintain their integrity and set an example for the people. If they were to extort money under false pretenses or engage in bribery and corruption, it would be illegal. Therefore, the provincial government yesterday specifically instructed the county magistrates to conduct thorough and secret investigations. Once verified, they should be severely punished according to the law.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Experimental Elementary School Teachers' Union Petition: Due to the long delay in the issuance of salaries to various schools, causing extreme hardship, the teachers and staff of the Provincial Experimental Elementary School publicly elected Chen Bangyan, Fan Ganfu, Gan Cheng, and others to jointly petition the Department of Education yesterday. Section Chief Yang of the Second Section received them. The representatives stated three points: (1) The delay in salaries has severely affected the livelihoods of colleagues; (2) The outstanding funds must be issued by the end of January; (3) The salary standards and seniority-based salary increase methods for the staff of the Experimental Elementary School urgently need to be established and revised. Section Chief Yang replied, stating that the department was aware of the hardship caused by the delay in salaries for elementary school teachers and staff and was determined to find ways to raise funds. He would send another letter to the Education Fund Management Office soon, requesting that the outstanding salaries be cleared by the end of January. As for raising salary standards and seniority-based salary increase methods, due to limited funding, it was not possible to implement them immediately. The department was determined to plan in advance in the shortest possible time and hoped to realize them within the 20th year of the Republic. The representatives considered the reply satisfactory and then took their leave.</p>

<p>Hostages from Xindongwei Rescued: Cao Erhe's family in Xindongfang Grain Embankment, Xintai, had three women kidnapped by bandits on New Year's Eve. The bandits initially demanded 40,000 dollars, eventually reducing it to 10,000 dollars. The Cao family received the letter and entrusted someone to negotiate, first paying 7,000 dollars to redeem the three kidnapped women. With 3,000 dollars still owed, they were supposed to deliver it on the second day of the New Year.

<p>Salt Police Intercept Large Batch of Smuggled Salt: The Ci-Xi Sanqi City Salt Police Bureau Inspection Office received a tip-off yesterday stating that a large number of salt smugglers were transporting many loads of smuggled salt and would be passing through Sanqi City. Upon receiving the tip-off, the office immediately dispatched several salt police officers to wait at Chaling Bridge. At around 11:00 p.m., they saw more than fifty salt smugglers carrying salt loads coming towards the bridge. The salt police ordered them to stop, but the salt smugglers refused, putting down their salt loads and surrounding the salt police with their carrying poles.

Upon hearing the news, the Inspection Office immediately dispatched more salt police officers to rush over. Knowing that they could not resist, the salt smugglers abandoned the salt and fled. The police then hired boats to load the eighty to ninety bags of smuggled salt and transport them to Ningbo for disposal by the Salt Police Bureau.</p>

It was his brother, Bo Ren. Bo Ren was a businessman in Xuebo and happened to be returning home that day. Because the journey was long, it was already dark when he arrived in his hometown, leading to his being shot dead by his brother. It was both a coincidence and a tragedy.</p>

<p>Huai River Steamer Robbed: Recently, due to the unrest caused by bandits in northern Anhui, the long-distance Huai River steamships have been robbed from time to time, so passengers are generally wary. The long-distance Tailai steamship, which sailed from Zhengyangguan, was robbed on the 20th. Before it set sail, eight bandits, secretly carrying six Mauser pistols and two steel knives, disguised themselves as merchants and bought tickets to board the ship. The ship loaded passengers and cargo at Zhengyang, set sail with a tow, and sailed downstream. That night, it arrived at Fengtai Wharf and docked. The next morning (21st), it set sail and arrived at Yanke. The bandits suddenly rose up, claiming to be investigating a case, and used their weapons to scare the passengers in the officers' cabins, searching them one by one, robbing them of more than 1,000 dollars in cash. After the robbery, the bandits ordered the ship to dock and went ashore together, fleeing with the stolen goods. After the ship was robbed, it opened to Shitoubu and reported the incident to the local garrison police team. The police led a team to arrest them, but the bandits had already fled without a trace. At 8:00 p.m. that afternoon, when the ship arrived in Yuanyuan, a student named Lu Chuanxue from a school in Tian Shou County returning to Huai was not seen disembarking. His three companions, including Li, searched for him in vain. Yesterday (22nd), they came to Bengbu and asked people to inquire, but there was still no news of him.</p>

<h3 id="e101">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Pays Attention to New Tax Rates <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Investigating Regulations Set by Various Provinces</p>
<p>Requesting a Percentage for Protecting the Cigarette Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is paying close attention to the unified tax, consumption tax, and various tax rates and collection methods newly implemented after the abolition of the Likin tax. What follows is a record of the news regarding the new taxes handled by the Chamber yesterday:</p>
<p>Collecting Regulations Set by Various Provinces: Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent telegrams to the Finance Departments of various provinces, the Finance Commissioners' Offices, and the Provincial Chambers of Commerce Joint Associations, stating: "Since being granted permission to abolish the Likin and reform the special consumption tax and business tax to compensate for the accumulated ills of the past decades, we are deeply gratified that such a move has been made. However, the reform of new taxes is closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. All merchants and citizens should have a deep understanding of whether the tax rates are appropriate and whether the collection is fair before implementation can proceed smoothly. Now that the regulations for the aforementioned taxes and the collection methods are about to be drafted, our Chamber, being located in Shanghai, the center of national commerce, is closely related to this matter. We hereby send this telegram, hoping that after the tax regulations and collection methods are drafted and implemented, a copy will be provided to us for reference. We would be most grateful. Signed, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>Telegraphic Request for a Percentage to Protect the Cigarette Industry: Yesterday, the Chamber telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and the Ministries of Finance and Industry, requesting that a percentage be set aside for protection when collecting the unified cigarette tax. The telegram stated: "According to a letter from the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association, 'Upon examining Article 1, Item 4 of the outline for abolishing domestic transit taxes and reforming the special consumption tax, it states that for items that must be encouraged or protected, the government, together with representatives from commercial organizations, will separately formulate measures for encouragement or protection.' This demonstrates the government's intention to respect commercial sentiments and implement protection, for which we are deeply grateful. The suffering of Chinese merchants in the cigarette industry is significantly different from that of other industries. Observers say that due to soaring gold prices and increased tax rates, costs have increased, business has become increasingly difficult, and sales have declined. We are unaware of other industries sharing these conditions. However, the economic invasion by foreign merchants is a fatal blow unique to Chinese merchants. Their capital is abundant, and their organization is complete. Chinese merchants' machines are not as sophisticated, and their experience is not as rich. Moreover, they set up factories in the interior, reducing transportation costs and facilitating supply. Large quantities of raw materials are imported, reducing costs. Investigators are stationed in various ports, and they offer longer credit periods to distribution points, which Chinese merchants with their limited capital cannot imitate. In addition, they have a deep foundation and have been profiting for a long time. If they see an increase in the sales of Chinese cigarettes, they will lower the price of their equivalent cigarettes to compete, and they will purchase and hoard the necessary raw materials for Chinese merchants in large quantities. The expense is only a drop in the bucket from the surplus of the foreign merchants, but it is more than enough to suffocate Chinese merchants. If we do not seek relief, Chinese merchants will have no foothold. Today, our government focuses on the people's livelihood and takes it as its duty to alleviate the suffering of the masses. The abolition of the Likin tax was intended to relieve the people's distress, and the increase in customs duties was intended to protect domestic products. Good policies are issued frequently, and benevolence is spread widely. Chinese merchants are as if they are in the depths of hell, seeing a glimmer of dawn. In the past, speaking out was ineffective, so we chose to remain silent. If we still do not speak out today, we would be burdening the government's good intentions towards protecting merchants and citizens. Examining the practices of European and American countries, when commercial competition occurs, the state allocates funds for subsidies, which is a constant practice. Currently, the entire Chinese cigarette industry is being invaded by foreign goods and has no way to resist. Advancing brings no profit, and retreating is impossible. If we do not formulate separate encouragement and protection measures, the dozens of Chinese cigarette factories and the hundreds of thousands of workers employed by them will feel as if they are drifting in the wind and rain. For the sake of promoting national products and rescuing the people's livelihood, we can only request the government to provide practical protection and approve the allocation of a certain amount from the collection of the unified tax to be used as bonuses. This would give our Chinese cigarette industry a chance to turn around, and the people's livelihood problem could also be partially resolved. The prosperity of the country depends first on the will of the people, and benefiting the country and benefiting the people can be achieved in one fell swoop. We have always admired your Chamber's leadership of merchants and your concern for the people's suffering. Please forward this to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry to plead for the Chinese cigarette factories and seek a solution.' Based on this, we have investigated that the Chinese cigarette industry has long been affected by the competition from foreign merchants and is limited by its short capital, and is facing dire straits. Therefore, we operate miserably, on the one hand to maintain the survival of national products, and on the other hand to consider the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of workers. Now that the outline of the special consumption tax has been promulgated, regarding the encouragement and protection measures in Article 1, Item 4, the intention to protect domestic products is implied in the average tax burden. If we can be allowed to allocate bonuses from the unified tax collection, not only will the business of Chinese merchants be slightly revived, but it will also show the government's benevolence in implementing protection. Based on the aforementioned situation, it is reasonable to telegraph and earnestly request your ministry to review and implement this, as it would be a great benefit. Signed, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government Adopts Shao Dian's Proposal: The Chamber previously telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance, suggesting that it pay attention to the business tax rate when drafting the business tax bill, and that it should follow the central government's regulations that the rate should not exceed two per thousand based on business volume and twenty per thousand based on capital. Yesterday, the Zhejiang Provincial Government replied via telegram, stating, "Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, We have received your Shao Dian telegram. We highly agree with the proposed measures. Before drafting the regulations and implementation rules for the collection of business tax in Zhejiang Province, the Department of Finance first invited leaders from the business community to attend a meeting for public discussion.

<h3 id="e102">Silk Merchants Request a Reduction in Business Tax <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Sending Representatives to Beijing and Zhejiang to Petition</p>
<p>Since the silk industry in this city heard that the Zhejiang Provincial Government had set the silk business tax at fifteen per thousand of the business tax amount, they believed that the tax levy was too high and they were unable to bear it, causing great anxiety. The Silk Industry Association convened an emergency meeting yesterday, and it was resolved to telegraph the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the tax be reduced to two per thousand, and to send representatives Wang Yansong, Luo Qinghua, Lu Zhengbing, Pan Xiangsheng, Wu Xingcha, Jiang Linshu, Lou Fengshao, Shen Zicha, and others to the responsible authorities in Beijing and Zhejiang today to petition. The telegram sent by the association to the Ministry of Finance and the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Submitting a request that the silk fabric business tax rate in Zhejiang Province is set too high, and merchants are unable to bear it. Please grant the same treatment as the cotton fabric business tax rate, reducing it to two per thousand to maintain sericulture. We respectfully request your review and implementation. It is reported that the regulations for collecting business tax in Zhejiang Province have now been set. Upon examining Article 5, it states that the detailed tax rates for the sale of goods are as specified in the attached table, and upon examining the attached table, it states that the business of selling goods is taxed according to business volume as follows: silk fabric industry, fifteen per thousand. Although the members of the association all have establishments in Shanghai, the majority of the goods they sell are silk fabrics from Zhejiang Province, and some have branches in Zhejiang. According to Articles 7 and 9 of the regulations, they have a direct interest in this matter. After repeated study, we believe that this tax rate is too high and detrimental to the survival of our business. We respectfully present the reasons to your Ministry in detail. Upon examining Article 8 of the Supplementary Measures for the Collection of Business Tax, it states that for those whose taxable base is the amount of business revenue, Article 4 of the Outline shall be followed. Article 4 of the Outline stipulates that the business tax rate shall be calculated using the per thousand method based on the taxable base, and the collection shall not exceed two per thousand, but this does not apply to luxury businesses and other businesses that should be suppressed. The current silk fabric business tax rate set by Zhejiang Province has already exceeded the maximum limit. Presumably, the intention is that silk fabric is considered a luxury business, so the tax rate is particularly high. The first question in this case should be to clarify whether silk fabric is a luxury business. Our country has always been known for establishing itself on agriculture and sericulture, and this has been the case for four thousand years. Since sericulture is the foundation of the nation, and is mentioned together with farming, it is evident that it has never been considered a luxury item. Therefore, the four characters of cloth, silk, beans, and millet have become a common collocation of nouns, which has been passed down to this day, and the clothing of rough cloth and the hat of fine silk have been praised in history as a testament to the frugal virtues of the new nation. Because domestic silk fabrics are strong and easy to wear, although the price is higher than cotton fabrics, the utility is more durable than cotton fabrics. Therefore, purchasing a silk garment that is more durable than a cotton garment may be more economical when calculated in total. According to historical concepts, as such, and based on the facts, we do not want to recklessly regard silk fabrics as luxury items. Furthermore, based on national policy, this time in the customs tariff, apart from tobacco and alcohol, the tax on foreign silk fabrics is the highest. The reason is that our country's silk industry has declined greatly in recent years, and this is intended to maintain it. If it is considered a luxury item, then the country should suppress it, not maintain it. If it is recognized that it should be maintained, it can be proved that it is not a luxury item. Moreover, Japan in Korea and France in Vietnam both consider imported Chinese silk as a luxury item and levy heavy taxes. Our country has also made great efforts to negotiate. Now, for domestic silk fabrics, it is considered to be in the category of luxury items. In the future, if there are similar negotiations, what wording should be used? This is especially a matter that should be considered carefully. Silk fabric is taxed at two per thousand as a manufacturing business tax when it is woven by weaving households, according to Article 4 of the Zhejiang Provincial Business Tax Regulations. When it is sold wholesale, it is also taxed according to Article 7 of the regulations. When it is sold from wholesale to retail stores, it is taxed according to the tax rate specified in the attached table. Moreover, Article 2 of the Special Consumption Tax Regulations clearly stipulates that fabric tax is one of the consumption taxes. Silk fabrics are taxed four times in accordance with current tax law, and the burden is already duplicated. If the set tax rate is too high, stores will be unable to compensate. The only option is to close down. Moreover, the Special Consumption Tax Regulations also distinguish between luxury goods, semi-luxury goods, and daily necessities in terms of the taxable base. If Zhejiang Province classifies silk fabric as a luxury item for business tax, how can silk fabric be unique when the fabric tax is implemented in the future? It will inevitably be oppressed by the double luxury tax, and the silk fabric industry will be even more difficult to survive. After careful consideration, we are really shivering. Recently, many silk factories in Shanghai and Wuxi have been closed down, which is related to the national livelihood. The government has specially approved the issuance of 8 million yuan in public bonds to maintain business needs. Zhejiang Province knows best about the number of silk factories that have closed down and the number of weaving households that have lost their jobs in various parts of Zhejiang Province. The difficult situation is no less than that of silk factories. However, since the issuance of public bonds is an original creation, we dare not ask for an example, and are preparing to ask for tax exemptions to ease the burden. Unexpectedly, this time, when the business tax was created, it was listed in the scope of luxury goods, so that the burden exceeded the maximum limit by seven times as high a tax. Even if all efforts are made, it will be difficult to bear. We dare to present this to your Ministry for review and approval based on the above-mentioned reasons, and respectfully request that you change the example of cotton fabrics and pay tax at two per thousand of the business volume, which is fair. In addition to presenting it to the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance and the Ministry of Finance, we respectfully present it to the Ministry of Finance and the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance."</p>

<p>Taking Office at the End of This Month</p>
<p>The Control Yuan Will Be Established Next Month</p>
<p>Seeking a Broad Selection of Control Committee Members</p>
<p>Yu Youren, President of the National Government Control Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the morning of the 23rd. In the afternoon, he met with Vice President Chen Guofu to inquire about his illness and discuss various important matters concerning the establishment of the Control Yuan and the selection of inspection committee members. Yesterday, he received visitors from various parties at his residence. A reporter from this newspaper made a special visit yesterday to inquire about matters concerning the Control Yuan. He replied as follows: "The rumor that I will be sworn in on the 26th is not accurate, because the notification has not yet been issued, and there is no time to do so. Generally, I will be sworn in at the end of this month. As for the date of the establishment of the Control Yuan, it is difficult to predict because preparations have not yet been completed. It is expected that it can be formally established next month. Regarding the number of members of the Control Committee, the exact number is not yet determined, ranging from nineteen to twenty-nine. Although it is not necessary for each province to have a representative in the allocation of personnel, it is always desirable to be more universal. The list has not yet been drafted. I met with Mr. Guofu yesterday (the 23rd), and his illness has improved compared to before. We did not talk about when he will go to Beijing," and so on.</p>

<p>Causing Public Outrage Among Overseas Chinese Merchants</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Has No Response at Present</p>
<p>Regarding the incident of Japanese officials in Korea insulting our national flag, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a serious protest. Yesterday, according to a friend in diplomatic circles, he received a letter from Zhang Weicheng, the Korean Consul General, which described the incident in detail. It stated: "A few days ago, Chinese businesses in the Hageyu area of ​​Korea, Chunji, Jianchang, Yonghe and other businesses, were notified by the Chinese Consul in Wonsan that they would be closed for five days during the New Year and would hang the national flag to celebrate. They followed this, but on the afternoon of New Year's Day, the chief of the Japanese police station in the area toured the streets and pulled down the Chinese national flags of the businesses and threw them to the ground, showing great anger. Overseas Chinese merchants from Hamhung and other places were greatly outraged by this, and asked the Wonsan Consul to negotiate seriously and put forward conditions: (1) Punish the police chief, (2) The local governor should formally apologize to our consulate. Wonsan Consul Yang negotiated with the local governor but there was no result, so he urgently reported to Zhang Weicheng for instructions on how to deal with the matter. He immediately lodged a serious protest with the Governor-General of Korea, with the aim of punishing and apologizing for the offense. Chinese groups in various parts of Korea have also telegraphed the central government, and the Japanese side has not yet responded," and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e111">The New Ming Ship Has Returned to Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Crew Members Describe the Situation When They Were Robbed</p>
<p>The New Ming Ship of the China Merchants Bureau, which was robbed by bandits in Honghai Bay, arrived in Shanghai from Min the previous night at 8 p.m. and berthed at the Jinliyuan Wharf. According to the crew members, the robbery took place at 11:00 p.m. on the 10th of the month, at Xiaobanmen, the sea area bordering Wenzhou and Ningbo. There were a total of eleven pirates hiding in the cabin, averaging about 30 years old. The leader was about 40 years old. They were all dressed in ragged clothes and had simple luggage. When the incident occurred, the man who was about 40 years old gave the order, and each took out a pistol. The crew members were confined in the kitchen, and the passengers were forced into the lower cabin. Each had a thief guarding the door. The engine room, the control room, and the radio station were also occupied. At the same time, the lights were turned off and the robbers began to plunder. The pirates first asked the crew members for the compradors. The Zhang substitute comprador, the Peng second comprador, and the Chen third comprador had all mixed into the passengers. However, the pirates were in a hurry to ask the crew members, so they were about to shoot the Zhang Zhonglian substitute comprador. Zhang Zhonglian had no choice but to come forward. The thieves forced him to hand over the key to the accounting room and the insurance cabin, and the thieves looted them. They also ordered the painters on the ship to paint the yellow chimneys and ship rails of the Xinming ship black. Because the Xiaobanmen area was flanked by two mountains and it was very dark, the thieves were able to wash the ship for two full days and nights. On the morning of the 11th, a pirate ship came to move the stolen goods. A total of ten large boxes of goods were moved away, including eight boxes of Zhi Ni, cigarettes and two boxes of cash. The loss of cash was about 20,000 yuan. There were seven pistols and quick guns on the ship, which were also robbed. The substitute comprador Zhang Zhonglian and four passengers were abducted. One of them has now been rescued in Guangdong.</p>
<h3 id="e112">The Purchasing Agent of Anqing Steamer Arrests the Head of the Tea Room <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Causing a Serious Labor Dispute</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., Fan Chenghua, the purchasing agent of the Taikoo Company's Yangtze River steamer Anqing, sent Zhu Shaobai, the head of the tea room, to the French Concession patrol for punishment, which aroused the opposition of the tea rooms of the entire ship and caused assistance from the tea rooms of other company ships, almost becoming a work slowdown. It has not been resolved yet. The detailed details of the incident are checked and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fan Chenghua, who was responsible for collecting subsidies, took over the Anqing wheel last winter. After taking office, he ordered all the tea rooms on the ship to pay two yuan for each meal, that is, six yuan per month, and a total of twenty-seven yuan for each meal in the cabin, and forty-five yuan for each meal in the economy class. Yesterday, when the ship arrived in Shanghai, he asked the head of the tea room, Zhu Shaobai, to collect it. Wang refused to pay because there was no such precedent. Fan then issued an order to dismiss Wang. At 4:30 p.m., Wang was twisted and sent to detention in the French Concession patrol room and ordered to hand it over.</p>
<p>The labor union asked for help. All eighty-nine tea rooms on the ship went to the Seafarers' Union after Wang was arrested to ask for help. The labor union first asked Fan, and Fan replied in a letter, saying that Zhu Shaobai, the head of the ship's room, had failed to pay for meals twice, and had no deposit counter, and was extremely contemptuous, so he had been expelled. The labor union immediately replied in a letter, saying, "We have received a letter stating that the head of the room failed to pay for meals twice and had no formal guarantee, so he has been expelled. While checking, we learned from all the workers on the ship that Zhu Shaobai has been arrested by your director." Matters such as workers failing to pay for meals and having no guarantee can be formally resolved by this union. It is inappropriate for your director to arrest him. You should hand Zhu Shaobai over to the union for management. The ship is about to sail soon. This case cannot be resolved for a while. The current situation will be maintained temporarily and the case will be discussed at a general meeting when Anqing arrives in Shanghai next time (February 4). Deal with Fan severely. All the representatives withdrew."</p>
<p>After this news spread, the tea rooms of various Yangtze River ships in Shanghai, such as Taikoo, China Merchants, Jardine Matheson, and Nissin, learned that Fan Chenghua was oppressing the workers and causing public outrage. Twenty-six representatives were elected from various ships and rushed to the labor union to ask for help. The labor union sent Standing Committee member He Zhenhuan to the ship to negotiate with Fan. He returned to the union at 6:00 p.m. and learned that Zhu had been sent to the French patrol, but Fan refused to hand him over, and there was no result. According to the proposal of the representatives, a final confrontation was planned. After persuasion from the members, the current situation was temporarily maintained. It was decided to wait for Anqing to arrive in Shanghai after work (February 4) to hold a general meeting to discuss the case and deal with Fan severely. The representatives left one after another.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance Allocates One Million Yuan in Cigarette Treasury Bonds</p>
<p>To be Distributed by the Shanghai Office of the Central Relief Committee</p>
<p>In light of the severe disasters in various regions and the urgent need for relief, the Central Relief Committee specifically requested the National Government for further substantial funds to aid the disaster-stricken people of various provinces. President Chiang of the National Government approved the allocation of one million yuan and instructed the Ministry of Finance to allocate one million yuan from the Republic of China Year 20 Cigarette Treasury Bonds. The Chairman of the Shanghai Office of the Central Relief Committee, Mr. Wang Yiting, mortgaged these bonds at four banks, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Central South Bank, and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, for fifty thousand yuan in cash for distribution to disaster areas in various provinces. Currently, the following amounts have been allocated to the relief committees in various disaster areas: (1) Henan: over 99,900 yuan; (2) Shaanxi: 50,000 yuan; (3) Jiangsu: 30,000 yuan; (4) Winter relief in Beiping: 10,000 yuan. These relief funds were received by relief representatives Li Huan'ying and Hao Zuling from Beijing and Shanghai, respectively, from the Shanghai Office of the Central Relief Committee and remitted to the relief committees in various provinces for distribution. There are still over 300,000 yuan that have been allocated but not yet claimed by relief agencies in provinces such as Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Hubei, Shandong, Henan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Chahar. The office has telegraphed the relief agencies in various provinces, urging them to send representatives to Shanghai with official letters and seals to claim the funds.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Social Affairs Bureau Punishes Rice Boats Adulterating Rice with Water <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Ju Xiquan Rice Boat Detained for One and a Half Months</p>
<p>Rice arriving in Shanghai via river often involves the adulteration of rice with water. The Social Affairs Bureau deeply believes that this kind of malicious practice undermines commercial ethics and harms public health. It has repeatedly issued announcements strictly prohibiting such acts. Once verified, the original boat will be confiscated, and the boatmen will be severely punished as a warning. As previously reported, the bureau, based on a report from the Rice Merchants Association, found that a rice boat belonging to Ju Xiquan at the Nanshi rice industry pier was adulterating rice with water. It immediately sent personnel to investigate and, in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau's water patrol, detained the boat and summoned all relevant individuals to the bureau for questioning. After verifying that the rice had indeed been adulterated with water, the boat was confiscated. However, the Nanshi Rice Merchants Association repeatedly pleaded on behalf of the boatman, claiming that he was ignorant and that his entire family depended on the boat for survival. As the prohibition was newly implemented, they may not have been fully aware of it. They requested the bureau to be lenient and pardon this one time. Therefore, the adulterated rice boat was detained at the rice industry pier for one and a half months as a warning. Boatman Ju Xiquan was handed over to the Public Security Bureau for legal punishment, and he was released on bail. The bureau has now announced to all boatmen that any further violations will result in the confiscation of the offending boat without any leniency.</p>

<p>The National Federation of Commerce received instructions from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: To ensure proper implementation, it has been found that since the establishment of the National Registration Bureau, all company and business trademark registrations have been subject to an additional 30% educational fee on top of the registration fee. When the National Registration Bureau was abolished and the Trademark Bureau was established, specializing in trademark registration, and company and business registrations were brought under the Ministry's jurisdiction, the above registrations continued to be processed according to the previous regulations. Now that the Ministry has been organized and its organizational law has been promulgated, matters concerning the registration of companies, businesses, and trademarks will remain under the Ministry's jurisdiction. Effective from February 1st of this year, all the above registrations will be exempt from the additional educational fee to reduce the burden on merchants and the public. This instruction is hereby issued for compliance and dissemination, in addition to separate notifications, for all to follow.</p>

<p>A Disguised Fee After the Abolition of the Likin Tax</p>
<p>The Anhui Rice Merchants Association in Shanghai, regarding the disguised likin fee of two and a half li established in Anhui after the implementation of likin abolition, held an emergency meeting at 2 PM on the 23rd of this month. Standing committee members Yan Tianshan, Jiang Shaoqing, executive committee members Chen Xilin, Wang Yuelou, and over twenty other members attended. Jiang Shaoqing was elected chairman and declared that Anhui has historically been a rice-producing region, and Jiangsu Province has long relied on its supply without any restrictions. The Anhui government's pretext of "imposing a ban through taxation" is causing hardship to the people and harm to businesses more than anything else. After discussion, it was decided to submit a request to the central government for strict prohibition and to record the petition below: "Petition for the strict prohibition of illegal fee collection that harms the people and businesses. We respectfully request a strict order for its abolition." We believe that the government's implementation of likin abolition and tax increases is intended to eliminate the accumulated malpractices of customs barriers, increasing tax revenue for the party and the nation above and easing the burden on the people below. The benevolence of this policy is spreading, and joy is resounding far and wide. However, after the abolition of likin, the Anhui provincial government, citing the pretext of unrestricted rice exports from Anhui, established a Rice Fee Inspection General Office in Wuhu, the capital, and Dasheng Pass, collecting fees of six jiao per dan (unit of dry measure), etc. Since the success of the Northern Expedition, the unification of North and South, and the beginning of political tutelage, everything seeks unification and standardization. In years of abundant harvest in Anhui, exporting rice to supply the people of neighboring provinces, all under the jurisdiction of the National Government, should not be restricted, unlike the re-exporting overseas. Moreover, the National Government has explicitly ordered the abolition of likin, and all similar likin taxes should be abolished. Your province has already implemented this order, but the two-and-a-half li rice fee bureau, similar to likin, still exists in our Anhui. It has changed its name to the Rice Permit Fee Bureau, cleverly establishing new names, arbitrarily increasing fees, and intensifying oppression by sending troops to prevent resistance. Moreover, when collecting fees, the receipts only show twenty or thirty yuan for amounts of one hundred yuan, harming merchants and benefiting those who pocket the difference. Any slight questioning is met with obstruction. Rice merchants' boats are moored on the riverbanks, facing considerable risks, and they dare not argue, enduring the pain and swallowing their anger. Recalling the time before the abolition of likin, each dan of rice, from Anhui to Ningbo, was subject to several customs taxes, totaling only about six jiao. Now, the bureau's fee for each dan of rice is as high as eight or nine jiao. Such arbitrary actions cause hardship to merchants and harm the people. For the sake of maintaining the people's food supply and for the sake of their own businesses, the merchants cannot remain silent and must appeal to your honorable court to promptly and strictly prohibit and fundamentally abolish this fee to uphold the government's decrees and preserve the merchants' livelihood. Respectfully submitted by the Anhui Rice Merchants Association in Shanghai.</p>

<p>First Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committees Held Yesterday</p>

<h3 id="e121">Continued Report on the Reception of the British Economic Mission <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Supplement to the Speeches by Chen Shaokuan and Pan Di</p>
<p>As the British Far East Economic Mission was about to depart, it hosted a reception for various sectors at the Cathay Hotel the night before last to express its gratitude. Deputy Minister of Industry Mu Ouchu, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council McNeill, and Yu Qiaqing, among others, attended. The farewell address by the head of the delegation, Thomson, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The responses of Chen Shaokuan, Deputy Minister of the Navy, and Pan Di, British Attorney, are supplemented below:</p>
<p>Chen Shaokuan first thanked the delegation for their warm reception and stated that he, as a naval officer, was not eloquent and could only express his humble opinions in broken English. China is currently in a period of construction, and there is considerable room for the development of British trade with China. He knows that the delegation's visit to China has been very successful and hopes that the delegation members will see what they want to see. In his private opinion, British commerce is indispensable to China, and the delegation's visit is important and timely. He takes the host's cup of wine to wish the delegation members good health and hopes that they will convey to their countrymen the hope that Sino-British trade will see rapid progress on the basis of mutual benefit and that the friendship between the Chinese and British people will also increase.</p>
<p>Pan Di first wished Sir Thomson and the Economic Mission good health and stated that, based on his nine years of experience, he has been to many places, but Shanghai's hospitality is unparalleled. The business community of Shanghai should be grateful to the delegation for leaving their homes and traveling thousands of miles to promote trade with China. Progress of this kind benefits both countries. Furthermore, sticking to one's home and picking up scraps from others is of no practical use, so direct knowledge is the most important. As a lawyer, he often distrusts hearsay evidence because it is not admitted in British courts. He often wonders what a newspaper would be like if a judge were its editor-in-chief. If a judge were to sit in the editor-in-chief's chair, reporters would return to the office with detailed reports of fires, railway accidents, plane crashes, and tragedies. The judge-editor would ask, "Were you at the scene of the fire, railway accident, plane crash, or tragedy?" The reporter would reply, "No, but we have spoken with eyewitnesses." The judge would surely say, "Go away, that is not evidence." The next morning's newspaper would be terrible. Therefore, the best information must be sought from its source. He does not mean that you should not listen to personal opinions, but personal opinions are based on facts. He asks you to examine for yourselves whether the facts are true. Your examination of China will be broad, and you will see the excellent aspects of China. The reports and evidence you collect on trade with China will benefit all parties in the future. We are deeply gratified and look forward to your report.</p>

<p>Renamed National Business Transportation Conference</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a respectful telegram from the Ministry of Railways yesterday stating: Having examined the Ministry's calling of the National Railway Freight Rate Conference, as noted in previous telegrams to your Federation, it has been found that many proposals have been put forward, and matters related to business transportation are not entirely within the scope of freight rates. To ensure that the name matches the reality, the Ministry has now renamed the conference the National Business Transportation Conference, which will still open on March 1st. Please take note and inform the chambers of commerce in various regions accordingly. Respectfully printed by the Ministry of Railways.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Special News from the Shipping Industry <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Resolution of the Japanese Warship Collision Case The Yangtze River steamer Hong Yuan of the Sanbei Company collided with the Japanese warship Atago in Hankou last time. The Japanese warship suffered only minor damage. Afterwards, the Japanese side made a request for repair costs. After repeated negotiations with the Sanbei Company, a resolution was reached yesterday. Sanbei acknowledged and paid 600 yuan in repair costs, bringing the matter to a close.</p>
<p>Longshan Towed and Unloaded Cargo The Longshan steamer, which was transporting salt from Haizhou to Hankou, ran aground at Xiaogushan due to shallow water and has been stranded for half a month. The Sanbei Company has now dispatched the Taishan steamer to the scene to quickly unload the salt from the Longshan to lighten the ship's hull. A tugboat will then be dispatched to rescue it.</p>
<p>The Wuneiguan Customs Post Will Not Be Abolished After the implementation of the abolishment of Likin and increased taxation, cotton transported from Longshan in the interior of Ningbo to Yongbo for transshipment by steamer is still being taxed by Yongbo. Various merchant guilds in Shanghai have telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for instructions. Yesterday, they received a reply telegram stating that the abolition of Likin applies to regular customs posts outside of fifty li, while regular customs posts within fifty li will continue to collect taxes. Cotton transported from Longshan to Yongbo is subject to the Wuneiguan tariff and should be taxed according to regulations. The request for exemption should be denied.</p>
<p>Wuxue to Reinstall Water Cables Yesterday, the Ministry of Transportation issued an instruction stating that the aerial cables installed in the Wuxue area have been damaged and cannot be reused. It has been decided to reinstall water cables in the Wuxue section to facilitate telegraph transmission. The materials department has selected two coils of water cable, which will be shipped from Shanghai for reconstruction as soon as possible. The procedure for contracting transportation was already being discussed yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Shanghai Shipping Merchants Lease Nanshi Waterfront <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Correspondence Regarding this Matter</p>
<p>Shanghai shipping companies have repeatedly gathered with the Public Utilities Bureau to discuss the lease of the Nanshi waterfront. An agreement has been reached. The correspondence between the Municipal Government and the Shipping Association regarding this case is recorded below.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government to the Shipping Association: With regard to the letter from your association submitted by the Mayor regarding the contract for the lease of the Nanshi waterfront by the shipping companies and the berthing fee, the matter has been discussed and recorded by the Municipal Council. The following amended measures have been determined by our office and the Director of the Land and Public Utilities Bureau after convening representatives of various companies: (1) The rental price will be standardized based on the average of the original price set by the Land Bureau and the price assessed by the Real Estate Evaluation Committee. (2) Article 7 of the Berthing Fee Regulations regarding restrictions on vessels and berthing fees will be temporarily amended as follows for this year: (1) There will be no limit on the number of own vessels; (2) When vessels of other companies berth alongside, two-thirds of the berthing fee will go to the original leasing company and one-third to the Municipal Government. At the end of this year, the situation will be reassessed and re-discussed. In addition to the separate orders issued by the government to the Land Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau to comply, a corresponding letter is sent to you for your information. Addressed to the Shanghai Shipping Association, Concurrent Acting Secretary-General Yu Hongjun.</p>
<p>Shipping Association to the Municipal Government: In reply, upon receiving your office's Public Letter No. 1083, we have forwarded it to the merchants leasing the wharves and warehouses on the Nanshi waterfront for their information. Afterwards, they claimed that Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Secretary-General Yu had a second face-to-face discussion on this case, and the association sent a letter informing them of the results. They then gathered and discussed the matter themselves. There are still points that need to be corrected and requested, which they are about to present to the Association for submission. Now, we have received the Municipal Government Secretariat's Public Letter, which shows the Municipal Government's concern for the difficulties of merchants and its intention to maintain the shipping industry, for which we are deeply grateful. However, the points that need to be corrected and requested must continue to be presented in order to facilitate matters: (1) The average of the original price set by the Land Bureau and the revised rental price set by the Real Estate Evaluation Committee as the rental price for public land can be reluctantly accepted. Upon receiving notification from the Land Bureau, we will enter into a contract. (2) Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the Berthing Fee Regulations, there is no limit on the number of own vessels. We have received the order, but there are two points that need to be corrected: (A) As a result of the second discussion between Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Secretary-General Yu, there is also no restriction on the number of agency vessels. The facts and reasons why agency and borrowing are different have been detailed in the Municipal Government's summaries and previous discussions. However, the Municipal Government Secretariat's Public Letter does not include the fact that there is no restriction on agency vessels. This is the first point that needs to be corrected. (B) According to the results of the second discussion, the method of allocating the berthing fee for borrowed vessels in three shares is on a trial basis for one year, while there is no agreement for a trial period of one year for the unrestricted number of own vessels. However, the Municipal Government Secretariat's Public Letter also considers the current year as a period of temporary amendment, which is inconsistent with the results of the discussion on that day and is believed to be a miscommunication. This is the second point that needs to be corrected. (3) When other vessels (referring to those that are not agencies but are only borrowing) berth at the wharves leased by the leasing company, the berthing fee will be allocated in three shares: one for the government and two for the merchant. However, in order to avoid ambiguity in fee collection, the leasing company should be requested to issue invoices for this berthing fee and collect it from other vessels. The company will then pay the official share to the Municipal Bank and record it in the register of the Public Utilities Bureau's Wharf and Warehouse Management Office. (4) In the Municipal Government's plan to organize and renovate the Nanshi waterfront wharves, before the addition and relocation of various floating wharves are realized, there are many ships and few wharves, which are insufficient for berthing. This is well known by the government. Allowing other vessels to berth at the wharves leased by the leasing company is actually for the sake of alleviating the difficulties of the Municipal Government and maintaining the operations of the same industry. Therefore, the Municipal Government should be requested to allow the berthing fee to be collected at the old price of Datong and Dada companies and allocated in shares. (5) Once the addition and relocation of the floating wharves are completed according to the renovation plan, the berthing fee for other vessels from Wharf No. 1 to Wharf No. 9 (i.e., within the leased land of the old Datong company) can be collected according to the Berthing Fee Regulations and still allocated in three shares. However, Wharf No. 13 to No. 17 (i.e., within the leased land of the old Datong company) are far from the bustling city center, and most of the vessels berthing are cargo-laden. The Municipal Government should be requested to allow a 30% discount on the price of the Berthing Fee Regulations, which will still be allocated in three shares. (6) The reason for leasing the wharves is to meet the needs and applicability of berthing vessels. However, each wharf is abnormally silted up. Larger ships, even when empty, have difficulty berthing, and smaller ships cannot set sail when fully loaded, resulting in various sufferings such as wasting time, damaging the bottom of the ship, and missing the schedule. The dredging should be expedited and actively carried out at the same time to meet the needs and facilitate the applicability. Otherwise, if the leasing company temporarily delays the payment of the monthly wharf rent, the situation should be viewed with understanding. We are entrusted to forward this information. We hope that you will convey this to the Mayor as much as possible and instruct its implementation to show consistent completion and that all shipping merchants will be more grateful.</p>
<p>The Shipping Association submits a document to the Municipal Finance Bureau requesting its review and instruction: Regarding the various requests made by the merchants leasing the wharves and warehouses on the Nanshi waterfront, which were submitted for review and instruction, the details are described below: (1) Deposit Interest: Article 2 of the already signed wharf contract states that the deposit will bear annual interest of 5%, paid every six months, and drawn with the interest slip issued by the Finance Bureau. In the land lease contract that has not yet been signed but has already been printed, Article 2 also states that the deposit will bear annual interest of 5%, paid every six months, and drawn with the interest slip issued by the Finance Bureau. The annual interest on the deposit must be drawn with the interest slip issued by the Finance Bureau, which is a fixed case that is not easily changed and should be followed. However, the aforementioned interest slip has not yet been issued by the Finance Bureau to the merchants. We request that you forward this and expedite its issuance. (2) The deposit receipt issued by the Finance Bureau seems too ordinary. As this receipt needs to be kept for a long time, a special format should be established to show solemnity. We request that you forward this and consider changing it. (3) The dates on which various merchants paid the deposit are different. We request that you forward this to the Finance Bureau to calculate the first interest payment uniformly to the end of 1929. Afterwards, the interest can be drawn with the slip at the end of June and December each year without any further discrepancies, in order to standardize and facilitate calculation. We request that you forward and review the above three items. We have reviewed that the merchants' so-called forwarding sections are all reasonable and factual requests. Therefore, we respectfully submit this document, hoping that you will approve its implementation. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Ministry of Industry and Commerce Pays Attention to the Liquidation of the Day and Night Bank <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram ordered the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to promptly and carefully handle the liquidation.</p>
<p>Lottery-linked savings schemes that have not been approved will be banned.</p>
<p>The ministry ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to expedite the liquidation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram was received from Nanjing stating that the Shanghai Day and Night Bank and the Great World Savings Department, whose main business is absorbing small deposits, have many depositors who belong to the lower and middle classes of society. Many of them are ordinary people’s hard-earned money. Now, suddenly stopping business for liquidation will have a huge impact on the financial situation of ordinary people’s society. Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau was telegraphed to promptly and carefully handle the liquidation. Furthermore, since the bank has not been approved for company registration and is not a limited liability company, it should not be liquidated according to the method for limited liability companies to protect the interests of depositors.</p>
<p>Strictly Ban Lottery-Linked Savings: The bureau was also ordered that any unauthorized operation of savings businesses without prior approval, and the exploitation of social vulnerabilities to absorb small savings from ordinary people with high-interest rates and lottery-linked schemes, must be strictly prohibited. Banks that have not been approved for company registration but use the name of a company without authorization should be strictly ordered to apply for registration; otherwise, a letter should be sent to the court to handle them strictly according to the law.</p>
<p>Creditors' Group of the Amusement Department Established: Tang Shengde, Hu Jianxiao, and more than one hundred other creditors of the Great World Savings Amusement Department established a creditors' group office at No. 22 Beijing Road, in the joint office of Wang Zikang, an accountant, and Ni Gang, a lawyer. A founding meeting was convened the day before yesterday, and the attendance was quite crowded. Hu Jianxiao was publicly elected as chairman and Tang Tianmin as secretary. After observing formalities, Hu Jianxiao reported that the Great World Savings Amusement Department is an affiliated organization of the Great World, and all debts should be borne by the directors of the Great World with unlimited liability. He urged the participants to recognize this point and work hard to negotiate. Subsequently, discussions on various issues began. It was resolved that: (1) the group will be named the Great World Savings Amusement Department Creditors' Group to clarify the boundaries and avoid confusion; (2) for the sake of gathering ideas and broadening benefits, a newspaper advertisement will be placed to notify all creditors to register at the office; (3) all expenses will be fully borne by Hu Jianxiao, Tang Shengde, and ten other large creditors to avoid further losses to small creditors; (4) lawyer Ni Gang will be hired as an honorary legal advisor; (5) accountant Wang Zikang will be hired as an honorary accounting advisor to participate in checking the accounts of the amusement department when necessary; (6) other procedures and the selection of staff members will be reported and handled at the first general meeting to be convened on a selected date next week.</p>
<p>Resolutions of the Creditors' Meeting: After the death of the wealthy merchant Huang Chujiu, the Day and Night Bank and the Great World Savings Amusement Department, which he founded, were entrusted to a liquidation committee by the post-mortem committee. However, there is no definite guarantee for the savings. The creditors had no choice but to hold the first meeting of creditors today (January 23) at the law office of Yan Luqing, No. 9 Edward Road. The resolutions are recorded below: (1) This group is named the Day and Night Bank Great World Savings Amusement Department Creditors' Group. (2) This group will temporarily borrow Yan's law office for office space. (3) This group should immediately issue a declaration. (4) If there are creditors who have not joined this group, they should be allowed to continue to register. (5) Please entrust lawyer Yan to guide and handle the affairs of this group. (6) Upon investigation, the depositors' savings are mostly accumulated from meager earnings, and most of them are women and workers. The amounts mostly range from one yuan to several tens or hundreds of yuan, which has a huge impact on the livelihoods of ordinary people. Lawyer Yan has always been known for his righteous and courageous actions, so we specially request lawyer Yan to serve as the honorary lawyer for this case. Lawyer Yan has generously agreed. (7) Send a letter to the Huang Chujiu post-mortem committee, Mr. Yu, Wang, and Yuan, requesting them to put forth effort to handle the matter. (8) Request a balance sheet from the liquidator for the Day and Night Bank Great World Savings Amusement Department as of the date of the business suspension. (9) Investigate all of Huang Chujiu's inheritance. (10) Resolve to make great efforts to achieve the goal of fully recovering the deposits. However, the depositors' savings are accumulated from meager earnings, by scrimping and saving, every penny representing blood and sweat. They are the foundation for the elderly to support themselves, the foundation for the young to start a career, what widows rely on for life, and what children use to study. Once this happens, they are bewildered, disoriented, tears fill their faces, and there is endless pain. Just look at the laborers and shop assistants who have been beating their chests and stamping their feet in front of the two locations for days, and the crying old women and old men. The tragic scene is difficult to describe. At this time of severe winter and cold, the weaker ones may face life-threatening dangers, and the stronger ones may resort to risky actions, creating social unrest. It is heartbreaking to talk about. In terms of legal aspects, lawyer Yan Luqing has generously agreed to serve as an honorary lawyer. We hope that all sectors will show sympathy and provide assistance, which is extremely urgent. January 23, 20th year, at the office of Yan Luqing, lawyer, No. 9 Edward Road.</p>
<p>Third Committee Meeting of the Creditors' Group: The creditors' group of the Day and Night Bank and Savings Department held its third committee meeting yesterday (20th) at 7:00 PM. Twenty-three committee members attended. Chen Jiejie was elected as chairman and Zhu Hailan as secretary. The meeting proceeded as planned. (1) Report: (1) Yesterday, six representatives were elected to go to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and various organizations such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to present the situation and request assistance. Today, because the representatives arrived too late, it was decided to gather together and go tomorrow, and also go to the Huang family post-mortem committee to inquire about the situation and ask them to express their attitude to reassure the public. (2) The registration situation today was extremely crowded, with as many as seven or eight hundred people from morning to evening. Among them, workers, women, the elderly, and the weak were the most miserable, mostly with sad faces and tears in their eyes, and even stamping their feet and beating their chests. There were also many students who had deposited all their tuition fees for several years. Once it shakes, it will affect their entire lives, and it is inevitable that there will be words of anger. It is planned to add several registrars tomorrow to facilitate the process. (2) Resolutions: (1) Entrust Chen Huiqun to urge Tu Yunchao to attend every day and not ask for leave again. (2) Please have the secretary of the Jixi fellow villagers association concurrently serve as the secretary of this group to handle mimeographing and other matters, and give appropriate remuneration. (3) Mimeograph the declaration of this group and send it to various agencies, organizations, and important figures in the business community, please uphold justice. (4) Accounting Director Wu Tingying asked for leave due to business, and committee member Pan Binzhang will take on the responsibility alone. All expenses exceeding five yuan must be signed by a standing committee member before they can be withdrawn and spent. (5) The total number of registrations will be counted once a day, and the registrar will sign and file them in the accounting department. (6) Gather representatives tomorrow morning to prepare to go to the Huang family post-mortem committee. (7) Distribute duties among the standing committee members and add interim committee members to assist in various tasks. (8) The fourth committee meeting is scheduled to be held tomorrow at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Countless Diamonds Dazzling, Robbers Took Everything Together <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Robbery in Kaiming Lane Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Four Robbers Acted Separately</p>
<p>Diamond Broker Shot</p>
<p>Serious Injuries, Life-Threatening</p>
<p>At around 11:00 AM yesterday, a major robbery occurred at the home of Yong native Qian Meiting, a resident of No. 25, Lane 2, Kaiming Lane, Nine Acres, South City. A large quantity of diamonds worth a great deal of money was robbed, and the owner was shot. The detailed situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Family of Ye Yuqian: Ye Yuqian is from Dongting Mountain, Suzhou, 50 years old, and currently works at Zhenkang Foreign Goods Store on Wuxi Road, Public Concession. His home is at No. 24, Lane 2, Kaiming Lane, Nine Acres, South City. However, the single-building stone-gated house next door at No. 25 is also leased by Ye, who acts as a sub-landlord. For convenience, Ye opened another door at the rear staircase entrance, which leads directly to No. 25. The house at No. 25 has four tenants. The ground floor is rented to Qian Meiting, a Yong native engaged in the jewelry business.</p>
<p>Four Robbers Searched and Robbed Separately: At around 11:00 AM yesterday, four robbers suddenly came and entered from the back door of No. 24 under the pretext of asking questions. Three robbers held guns. Two robbers went straight upstairs and into Ye's bedroom, overturning chests and rummaging through everything. The two robbers immediately grabbed Ye's maid, pointed guns to intimidate her into silence, and urgently asked where the Qian family lived, forcing the maid to lead the way. The maid, coerced by the power of the robbers, had no choice but to obey and opened the side door, leading them into No. 25 next door.</p>
<p>Evaluating the Value of Diamonds: Earlier, around 10:00 AM, Zhu Rufa (35 years old), a fellow Ningbo native and jewelry broker who lived at No. 1, Yingfali, Zhangjia Garden, Houjiabang, South City, suddenly came to Qian Meiting's place with a large quantity of diamonds worth a great deal of money to evaluate the price. Qian and Zhu were carefully examining the diamonds in the brighter light in the living room. At this time, in addition to Qian and Zhu, there was also Qian's partner, Xu Xingsheng (24 years old, from Dongting), who was inspecting pearls at another table.</p>
<p>Two Robbers Were Agile: While Qian and Zhu were carefully examining the diamonds, the two robbers suddenly entered the room at the same time, took out their guns, and forbade Qian and the others from making any noise. Qian, seeing this, knew he had encountered robbers and tried to scatter all the diamonds on the table onto the ground in the hope that the robbers would have difficulty picking them up, or that he could take the opportunity to report to the police and get lucky. Unexpectedly, the two robbers had already seen it and rushed forward to grab them all in their hands. At that time, Qian and Zhu were both standing behind the two robbers, intending to muster courage and step forward to capture them. At the opening of the side door, two more robbers rushed in.</p>
<p>Broker Shot While Chasing: When Qian and the others looked back, they saw two more robbers joining them, each holding a gun. They became timid and dared not step forward, but had to wait quietly for instructions. Seeing that the goal had been achieved, the robbers went out through the back door, two running out of No. 24 and two out of No. 25. At that time, the broker Zhu Rufa was anxious and chased after them. Unexpectedly, just as he reached the back door, a robber turned around and fired a shot at him. The bullet entered from the upper part of the left back. But Zhu did not realize it at the time and ran out from the front door to report to the police. When he returned to No. 25, he realized that he had been shot and wounded.</p>
<p>Police Arrived, Robbers Had Fled: When Zhu rushed out to report to the police, the number was very far from the post, and the lane was well connected in all directions. Therefore, when the police arrived, the robbers had already fled far away without a trace. At the same time, Qian, the director of the No. 1 branch of the No. 2 district of Chenxiange, immediately led the police to rush to the scene after hearing the news. But it was too late. They first took Zhu Rufa to Renji Hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctor, it was said that the bullet had hit the lungs but had not penetrated. The situation was quite dangerous.</p>
<p>Details of the Lost Diamonds: This reporter rushed to inquire after hearing the news. According to the sub-landlord Ye Yuqian, when the shooting occurred at No. 25, two robbers were still searching Ye's bedroom at No. 24. They had already taken out a leather robe and a mandarin jacket and were about to put them on to escape when they heard the gunshot downstairs. They abandoned the three pieces of clothing and only robbed forty yuan in small coins, which he said was fortunate. The numbers of the diamonds robbed from Qian's house are recorded below: a total of 485 small diamonds, weighing 31 carats, 13 carats per carat, and more than 40 carats, weighing 5 carats, more than 8 carats per carat, 15 Chinese diamonds, weighing 12 carats, more than 80 points per carat, 15 jade face duck egg rings inlaid with small diamonds, each inlaid with 18 small diamonds, 3 jade chicken hearts and 3 diamond floral arrangements, 4 pairs, 1 dancing ring inlaid with small diamonds, inlaid with 12 small diamonds, a round jade treasure in the middle, plus more than 10 spare parts.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Banditry Outside Songkou <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Water Police and Bandits in Fierce Battle: Recently, pirates have been rampant outside Wusongkou, appearing and disappearing without a trace, kidnapping and robbing, which happens from time to time. Recently, a fresh pig boat, Jinhetai, carrying more than 170 pigs, docked at Songkou, and the entire cargo was robbed. Although the Fourth District Water Police dispatched police to strictly investigate, there has been no trace. The day before yesterday, each ship escort inspector of the Pig Industry Office in Song was ordered to go to the mouth to investigate. District patrol officer Guan Dianfeng and 17th team patrol officer Gong Shanting supervised and led two escort ships to leave the port. At 11:00 in the evening, on the ocean surface near the fort, they found a fishing boat with suspicious shapes and traces. Just as they were about to approach the boat for inquiry, the bandits in the boat suddenly opened fire. At the same time, three more bandit boats fired fiercely at the two escort boats. Gao and Gong also led the police to return fire. The battle was fierce for more than an hour, and the sound of gunfire was continuous. When the sentry soldiers on the fort heard this, they opened fire remotely from the shore. The bandits began to retreat and fled south. Gao and other patrol officers, due to lack of ammunition and being outnumbered, did not dare to pursue them. They immediately returned to Song and reported to the office, which forwarded the report to the Fourth District Office. At the same time, they joined the 16th team patrol officer Jiang Liang and the 18th team patrol officer Wang Hongzhi, who were stationed in the port with two escort boats, and the 4th platoon of the Water Patrol of the Public Security Bureau, led by squad leader Ding Xiaoping, and patrol officer Song, who led a platoon of water patrol soldiers. They hired a drag and climb dinghy and set off to chase and investigate, reaching tens of miles away, but no trace of the bandit boat was seen. Because it was late at night and dark, it was not easy to pursue deeply. When the escort boats and dinghies returned to Song, it was already dawn. Yesterday, when I went to explore, I saw that there were still twenty or thirty pig boats and many other cargo ships parked outside the mouth, which showed that the bandit boats intended to come and rob the cargo ships. Through this attack, each cargo ship was able to preserve its cargo.</p>
<p>Pirates Engage in Firefight: Pan Kaiwu and Shen Guanxi, two gangs of pirates operating off the coast of Lvsi, outside Wusongkou, had another clash the day before yesterday due to a dispute over fishing donations and maritime boundary issues. Both sides summoned a large number of pirate ships and engaged in a fierce battle on the ocean surface of Daan Port. From 5:00 AM until 3:00 PM, the sound of gunfire had not stopped. Many bandits were killed and injured, and many bandit ships were sunk. It is said that the leader, Pan Kaiwu, had been shot and killed. The Fourth District Water Police has dispatched warships to suppress them. The coastal areas of Tongchonghaiqi counties are afraid that scattered bandits will sneak in, and have dispatched military police to temporarily deploy defenses, which are very strict.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Marriage Dispute of Zhang Shiming's Youngest Son <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Legal Mother Arranged Marriage With Niece</p>
<p>Biological Mother Did Not Express Consent</p>
<p>Six Thousand Yuan Failed to Settle the Matter</p>
<p>The Wedding Date May Face Problems</p>
<p>Zhang Shiming, a wealthy merchant from Nanxun, is the younger brother of Zhang Jingjiang, a great figure in the Party and the nation. His residence is in Xinchang Lane, Fujian Road. In the past, Zhang was once kidnapped, and then he escaped danger. Zhang was frightened and fell ill, and then passed away. Zhang has a wife, Ms. Xu, and a concubine, Ms. Zhou (namely Zhou Miaoying, 36 years old, from Suzhou), and nine children. His ninth son, named Qu'an, is the son of the concubine Zhou. He is now 18 years old. After Zhang's death, Zhou Miaoying moved to the home of relatives because of disagreement with Xu, while Qu'an still lived in Zhang's house and was raised by Xu. Recently, Zhou learned that Qu'an was going to be married to Xu's niece, but Zhou was not notified. She negotiated with Xu, but it was ineffective. So she hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to sue in the Special District Local Court, requesting permission for a preliminary injunction, ordering Xu to withdraw this marriage contract, on the grounds that she had not obtained the consent of the biological mother. Later, because there was hope for a settlement, the plaintiff's lawyer requested to withdraw the lawsuit. But after the case was withdrawn, there was no sincerity in the settlement. Zhou also learned that Qu'an had chosen to officially marry at his residence on the 26th of this month (that is, tomorrow), and negotiated with Xu again, but still to no avail. Yesterday, lawyer Yuan published a warning in the newspaper, but it was heard that Qu'an was willing to give his biological mother 60,000 yuan to prevent her from making trouble on the wedding day, while Zhou Miaoying needed 200,000 yuan to settle the matter. This matter has not yet been negotiated. If it cannot be resolved before the 26th, then Zhang Qu'an's wedding date will have to be selected again. The outcome of this case will be continued in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Dancer's Jewelry Cheated <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Worth More Than Two Thousand Gold</p>
<p>Sued for Failure to Recover</p>
<p>Dancing star Qu Baoxin, who was a dancer in dance halls such as the Paris and Moon Palace, lives at No. 921, Shanxiang Lane, East Hanbi Road. She met Tao Nason, a local, several years ago. On the evening of the 14th of the second month of the old calendar in the 16th year of the Republic, Tao invited Ms. Qu and her friend Zhou Guizhen and another man for dinner at the Pacific Western Restaurant. That evening, Ms. Qu wore two diamond bracelets, one diamond ring, and one jade bracelet, worth more than 2,000 gold. After the meal, Tao said to Ms. Qu that the current situation is unstable and there are many thieves. It is easy for thieves to notice you wearing these valuable ornaments, which is quite dangerous. It is better to hand them over to me temporarily and I will send them back tomorrow. Ms. Qu believed it was true, and handed over all the ornaments to Tao. Then they separated. The next day, Qu asked Tao for the items, but he repeatedly evaded and ignored her. Qu knew she had been deceived and hired a lawyer to sue in the Special District Court, requesting punishment for fraud. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge opened the court. The defendant was not summoned because his address was unknown. According to the plaintiff's testimony, she is 26 years old, from Guangdong, and explained the circumstances of the fraud and stated that the defendant was evading the Chinese community and requested that a warrant be issued for his arrest and interrogation. Judge Ge obtained the testimony and ordered the case to be rescheduled, waiting for the defendant to be arrested and interrogated.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Child Abandoned in an Empty Vat <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Is There a Complete Egg Under the Overturned Umbrella?</p>
<p>Is It an Illegitimate Child or an Abandoned Child?</p>
<p>Next to the Dasen Cloth Factory at the South End of Sanguantang Town, Pudong,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>There is a square open space that has been unused for some time, and on the open space are several empty vats belonging to a villager surnamed [blank]. For many days, the day before yesterday, around 6:00 in the morning, a villager surnamed [blank] passed by the place and suddenly saw an umbrella propped up high inside an empty vat. He couldn't help but feel suspicious. There was no room for people inside the empty vat, and although the weather was cloudy, it was not raining. Even if someone were inside, there would be no need to hold an umbrella. He went forward to take a look and found that there was no one under the umbrella, only a rush mat, wrapped quite tightly. The villager did not dare to look at it suddenly at first. He immediately gathered many people to watch and unwrapped the rush mat inside the vat to inspect it. What was stored inside the bag was clearly a newborn baby, only a few days old, with all its clothes. After being touched by people, it suddenly cried loudly. Everyone was greatly surprised, knowing that it was an abandoned child. For a moment, it was passed on by hundreds of people, and they came to watch. Everyone said that this must be an illegitimate child. They were afraid of being discovered, so a few days after birth, they were abandoned by the roadside. Fearing that it would freeze to death, they wrapped it tightly, and fearing that it would rain, they propped it up with two tools to allow families without children to take care of it. At that time, more and more onlookers gathered, and finally a woman surnamed Ling took it away to raise it. The Lu woman had no children at first, and was also bewitched by superstition, saying that raising an illegitimate child could lead to wealth.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Dong Yu Clarifies Dong Jiang's Lawsuit <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Hiring a Nanny to Educate a Child</p>
<p>Extending Care for Illness</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper carried a report about Dong Jiang's divorce case being urged for trial. Dong Yu has sent a letter to clarify the matter. The letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Respectfully, upon reading the news published in your esteemed newspaper concerning my family affairs, I find it inconsistent with the facts. This case has been ordered by the court for out-of-court settlement. Mediators have been contacted multiple times. Recently, accountant Pan Zhaobang and my uncle Shaoqing earnestly urged me to reluctantly agree to the conditions previously demanded by the other party. Respecting the earnest advice of elders and the good intentions of friends, I reluctantly agreed to accept them all. Unexpectedly, the other party suddenly reversed the previous agreement, creating unnecessary complications, which has delayed the resolution until now. The mediators are all in Shanghai and can easily be consulted for the facts.</p>
<p>The original statement mentions me hiring a teacher for my child's education, which shows a superficial understanding. It should be known that educating children is the parents' inherent duty. Moreover, my son lost his mother in childhood, making him a pitiful motherless child. No one takes care of his diet and clothing in cold weather. As I am tied up with numerous affairs, I cannot spare the time to fully care for him. Therefore, I had to hire a nanny-teacher to provide protection. I entrusted many people to find one, and recently, my friend Mr. Chen Ronglu introduced Ms. Cheng to fill the position. However, the employment contract has not been finalized, as I am still unsure whether my son will obey her teaching. The claim of two female teachers is even more of a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Recently, my son and I both contracted a cold, causing us great distress. My friend Mr. Qiu Zijia introduced Dr. Wang Yongchuan of the Red Cross to treat us. Knowing that we lacked care during our illness, he entrusted Dr. Wang to invite Mr. and Mrs. Xu Yefu to our residence to provide nursing care. The other party deliberately exaggerates this, and I truly do not understand their intentions.</p>
<p>Driven by responsibility and livelihood, even while bedridden, I cannot isolate myself from everything and concentrate solely on recovery. I still receive concerned parties before my sickbed. As the other party stated, anyone with a shred of conscience should show pity, yet they heartlessly use this as a reason to attack me. What kind of heart is this? It is truly extreme.</p>
<p>The lack of order in my family did not begin today. The day my first wife, Ms. Lu, passed away was the day my family lost its order. Thinking of this, my heart aches immensely. If the other party wants a clear distinction of status as soon as possible, they should quickly come to their senses and understand the court's intention to settle matters peacefully. Accommodating the good intentions of relatives and friends in mediation will surely fulfill their wishes. If they continue to indulge in unrealistic fantasies and offer temporary solutions to superficial problems, it may not be the right path. I have specifically presented the detailed facts to respectfully request a correction to reveal the truth and sincerely express my public obligations.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Phoenix Plane Lands in Chuzhou the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Bai Luo Fei, the head of the American firm Meixin's aircraft team, flew the Phoenix plane. After departing from Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 23rd), he was forced to land in a meadow near Chuzhou, Zhejiang, due to heavy fog that made it difficult to determine his position. The plane was undamaged. He immediately sent a telegram to Shanghai at 3:15 PM to report the incident. The company then immediately telegraphed the National Government for permission to release the plane. In the evening, they received a reply from Nanjing agreeing to the release. Yesterday morning, the head of the Aviation Administration, Zhang Huichang, also telegraphed Chuzhou for the release. However, as of 2:00 PM yesterday, they had not yet received a reply from Chuzhou, and it is unknown whether Mr. Bai has left Chuzhou or not. According to the company's speculation, he should be able to depart around noon yesterday and continue to Guangzhou.</p>

<p>Body Smashed into Two Pieces</p>
<p>The Songhu Railway's upward-bound train number 103 departed from Paotaiwan Station at 4:50 PM yesterday. When it reached Wai Yang Qi Tai, the driver glimpsed a woman walking on the iron bridge. The driver immediately sounded the whistle to warn her, but upon hearing the loud whistle, the woman panicked, causing her to fall on the bridge and struggle to get up. Seeing this, the driver immediately closed the valve and stopped the engine. However, due to inertia, the train continued forward, and the wheels ran over the woman's body, killing her instantly.</p>
<p>After the train stopped, the driver and the guard got out to inspect the scene. They observed that the woman was about forty years old, wearing old blue cloth clothes, with small feet. Her entire body was crushed into two pieces by the train wheels. The nearby tracks were stained with fresh blood, a gruesome sight. Subsequently, the train arrived at Wusong Town Station, and the guard reported to the stationmaster, who sent laborers to the scene of the accident to remove the body from the tracks, prepare a coffin for burial, and await identification by relatives. They also reported the matter to the Railway Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Automobile Company to Provide Compensation</p>
<p>Chinese Constable No. 3069 of the Public Concession was riding his bicycle on Yangshupu Road the day before yesterday. At that time, automobile No. 5058 was approaching from the opposite direction. The constable's bicycle suddenly moved in front of the car. The driver, Xu A'er, steered to avoid it, but the car's wing struck the constable's nose, causing him to fall. The car also crashed into a tree on the side of the road. People transported the constable to the Public Works Department Hospital for treatment. He was identified as Jin Dexin. Shortly afterward, he died from his injuries. His body was sent to the coroner's office. Yesterday morning, Special Court Commissioner Guo inspected the body and ruled that it be handed over to his brother, Jin Dexiang, for burial. He also instructed the automobile company to provide appropriate compensation.</p>

<p>Client Suffers Great Loss</p>
<p>Forced to File a Complaint</p>
<p>Lawyer Wu Chengyu from Guangdong was previously sued by the Shanghai Bank in the Special District Court for cleaning up the accounts of the Drunken Heaven Restaurant. This has already been reported in the newspapers. Recently, Gao Bingjiang from Zhenhai filed a criminal complaint against Wu in the Special Court for breach of trust and destruction of property. Gao, who resides at No. 34 Mingyuan Lane, Huade Road, was previously the head of a post office branch. Last August, he was sued in court by a woman named Wang Lu for abandonment. Gao hired Lawyer Wu to defend him, agreeing to a fee of 60 yuan, with 30 yuan paid in advance, for which Wu issued a receipt. However, Wu failed to appear in court for the three subsequent hearings, leading to Gao's detention. Gao argues that Wu, having been entrusted and received the fee, failed to appear in court, thereby committing breach of trust and other crimes. Therefore, he filed a criminal lawsuit. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Zhitan of the Special Court opened the court for interrogation. The defendant, Wu Chengyu, did not appear, but a lawyer appeared on his behalf, stating that Wu was attending court in the Jiangsu High Court and was therefore unable to attend. He requested a postponement and presented the High Court summons for inspection. Judge Ge then declared to Wu's representative lawyer that breach of trust and other crimes are punishable by imprisonment, therefore Wu himself must be present in court. The hearing was postponed to allow Wu to appear for questioning next time.</p>

<p>Wang Fugen, 32 years old, a local from Shanghai, who works as a ticket seller at the Public Concession Bus Company, resides at No. 42 Xinkang Lane, near Caojiadu on the western outskirts of Shanghai. In August of the 16th year of the Republic, he was introduced by a friend and began cohabitating with Ms. Su, a local woman, who is 28 years old. They were very affectionate and loving. Wang went out to work every day, and Ms. Su diligently managed the household, being very well-behaved. As time passed, Wang, considering her to be very simple and honest and capable of growing old together, took her as his wife. Relatives also treated her with respect and courtesy. Unexpectedly, after more than three years, she suddenly changed her usual behavior. She often went out to play with her female friends, neglecting household affairs. Although Wang repeatedly tried to stop her and took precautions, it was ultimately ineffective. The afternoon before yesterday, while Wang was working on the bus, Ms. Su took all of her clothes, jewelry, and other belongings (worth about 200 yuan) and fled without a trace. Wang returned home and discovered this, searching everywhere but finding nothing. Yesterday, Wang submitted a report with a photo attached to the Sixth District Police Station and the Jing'an Temple Police Station, requesting that they investigate and apprehend his runaway wife.</p>

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor: Having recently read the news column in your January 18th issue, regarding the Zhejiang Construction Department committee taking over the Inland Waterways Merchants' Shipping Bureau, it stated that the accounting staff of the Shanghai-Hangzhou bureaus require more than 10,000 yuan in monthly salaries, resulting in excessive expenses. After investigation, the accounting staff of the Shanghai-Hangzhou bureaus only receive 340 yuan per month, a huge discrepancy from the figure reported in your newspaper. Other reported items, such as the resignation of our bureau chief, are also largely inconsistent with the facts. We hereby request your newspaper to make a correction to avoid spreading false information. We value your professional integrity. Sincerely, Zhejiang Provincial Navigation Administration, January 22nd. To the Editor: Yesterday's article in your esteemed newspaper regarding the cause of Mr. Liu's tragic death contained inaccuracies that do not match the facts. The original article stated that there was a red light as a signal at the south gate, and also said that the gatekeeper was holding a rope, waving a red light, and that the police were assisting in shouting warnings. Even if Mr. Liu was foolish, he would not have been so foolish as to strike a stone with an egg and invite his own demise. It is not known that after Mr. Liu, three sections of fire pump trucks passed through the gate, with no more than three minutes between them. The more than ten firefighters on the trucks did not see any ropes, red lights, or gatekeepers or police calling for them to stop and rescue people. Not only was there no warning or obstruction before the incident, nor police prevention, there were no police, so how could there be shouting? Even five minutes after the incident, they were still asleep. Before and after the incident, they were afraid of the cold and lazy, and neglected prevention to this extent. It is also said that the north gate was being dismantled and repaired by the road engineering office, but it is not known when it was destroyed. Only the railway authorities know about this. Moreover, it was repaired the day after the incident, showing a clear attempt to mend the fold after the sheep are lost. Furthermore, although Mr. Liu's car was knocked dozens of feet away, because the car was small and the cushion was thick, Mr. Liu was only injured on the left side of his face and the corners of his mouth, with no other injuries on his body. It is evident that he lost consciousness due to the violent impact, and then no one came to his rescue, leaving him lying stiff in the icy snow for more than two hours, which is why he died. If it is said that Mr. Liu died from internal injuries, there is a doctor's diagnosis to prove it. Your esteemed newspaper has a duty to record what is heard, but since there are many discrepancies in the facts, we must state the facts and request that they be published in the Letters to the Editor section for correction. Sincerely, The Third Section Fire Brigade of Zhabei, January 23rd.</p>

<p>Important Education News</p>
<h3 id="e160">Military Science Courses Should Be Emphasized <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education approved the Directorate General of Training's consultation that military science course hours in senior high schools and above should not be scheduled outside of extracurricular training to emphasize the importance of the subject. A circular was sent to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, stating: "According to a consultation from the Directorate General of Training, 'Lei Zhenzhong, a military instructor in various private secondary schools in Xiamen, reported that the time for military science courses in the schools where he is responsible for military training is mostly scheduled outside of class time. After repeated negotiations, the schools all claim that there is too much coursework and it is impossible to allocate time. Military education is a required course, and if it is implemented outside of class time, most students will be absent, and the practical course will be impossible to implement. It is earnestly requested that a circular be sent to all schools nationwide stating that the time for military science courses must not be scheduled outside of extracurricular training, so as to conform to the main purpose of military education.' Based on this, military education in senior high schools and above has been stipulated as a required course by the plan and the physical education law and cannot be treated the same as optional subjects, causing difficulties in teaching. It is requested that you consult your ministry to issue a circular to all schools, starting from the beginning of the next semester of this year, to promptly correct any of the above situations and emphasize the importance of the subject. We hope to receive a reply." The Ministry of Education has determined that military training is a required subject, as stipulated in the revised military education plan for senior high schools and above, and a circular has been issued stating that students who fail military training will not be allowed to graduate in accordance with Article 6 of the National Physical Education Law. All public and private senior high schools and above should clearly understand the importance of military education, strictly implement training, and strictly prohibit the scheduling of military science course hours outside of extracurricular training, as this violates laws and regulations and disregards military training. In addition to ordering the Fujian Provincial Department of Education to investigate and severely criticize the schools concerned, and ordering them to make corrections, this order is also issued to the "departments" and "bureaus" for them to forward to the senior high schools and above under their jurisdiction for notification.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Another Turmoil at China National College <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Instruction Stalled, Students Disturbed</p>
<p>(National News Agency) Since the Executive Yuan explicitly ordered the Ministry of Education to investigate China National College President Ma Junwu, all faculty, staff, and students of the college deeply understand that only by urging Ma (Junwu) and Luo (Longji) to leave the college immediately can the student unrest be resolved and the crisis of China National College's demise be eliminated. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Office of Academic Affairs Suspended Its Operations. Yesterday (the 23rd), all staff of the Office of Academic Affairs issued a notice, the original text of which reads: "To the Editor: Mr. Ma Junwu violated the resolution of the Board of Directors approving his resignation and refuses to hand over the office. Recently, he has even gone against the tide, excluding dissidents and oppressing them, forcing the Dean of Academic Affairs to resign. We and others, out of love for China National College, have no choice but to temporarily suspend operations in the hope that he will awaken to his senses as soon as possible. We hereby declare. We respectfully hope for your understanding."</p>
<p>The Union to Urge the Assumption of Office. The Union to Resolve Student Unrest, organized by the college students, has reported the details of this dispute to the Ministry of Education, and has telegraphed Minister Jiang to urge Mr. Yu Youren to come to the college as soon as possible to assume the position of president.</p>
<p>The School Protection Association's Advice to Fellow Students. Another group of students in the college has risen up to organize a school protection movement, which many students have endorsed and joined. It is reported that more than three or four hundred people have signed up, and the organization is still in progress today. Yesterday, a letter of advice to fellow students was issued, which stated: "Fellow students, the crisis of China National College has arrived. To enable China National College to overcome this crisis, we can only, at this critical moment, adhere to our conscience, bring out the spirit of unity, adopt reasonable and appropriate measures, and not blindly follow or be deceived by anyone to resolve this danger. (Omitted) Fellow students, the wise students, Mr. Ma has been ordered by the National Government to be investigated. If we do not consider the interests of China National College and the interests of all the students, then we might as well follow the troublesome thugs to make a mess and hold on to China National College for the purpose of destroying it. If we want to take care of the interests of China National College, we should wash our hearts clean, clear our eyes, and use the spirit of concerted effort to tide over the difficulties together to plan for the survival of China National College. Let us no longer wait and see. We recognize this practical phenomenon, aim at this definite goal, and work hard for the survival of China National College and not be used by private individuals. This is our current responsibility. However, with limited abilities, we fear that we will not be able to obtain comprehensive and thorough results in the face of national difficulties. We hope that students will unanimously participate and work together towards the goal of saving the college." In addition, the delegation of representatives of all the students of China National College issued a declaration stating that the issue of changing the president of China National College in Wusong last year caused a great uproar. Then, all the students of the college jointly appealed to the president, Mr. Ma Junwu, to return to the college, which brought peace. At the moment, all the faculty and students of the college are working hard to improve and advance, and the internal stability is as usual. A few people recently secretly organized groups and issued declarations, which were met with an emergency notice published in the newspapers of Shanghai by all the students yesterday (Saturday). Before noon, three or four people posted anonymous notices. The school authorities stopped them, and they reset the students' head portrait, which was obviously injured. The person who was injured reported it to the Seventh District Public Security Bureau and will be prosecuted according to criminal law. At present, the order of the school is maintained by the police sent by the Public Security Bureau, and the situation is very good.</p>

<p>The sensational International Soccer Tournament is already in its second week of competition. The China team met the France team at Yiyuan yesterday, starting at 3 PM. China put on the pressure from the start but could not find a way to score. The first half ended with no score. In the second half, China scored four goals, setting the final score. From this point on, we will move forward and work hard for the future. Great young men, do not fail in your great mission. The opponent in the second round will be Portugal, who is both tough and skillful. At that time, the Jiannan athletes who conquered the Philippines will be able to serve and fight hard. Although the enemy is strong, we are also elite, and the outcome will depend on the efforts of the warriors.</p>

<p>The notice of the China-France match has been posted, and crowds of spectators gathered at Yiyuan. At half past two, the Chinese players, brave and spirited, marched into the field amidst thunderous applause, stretching their legs in the hope of gaining momentum for the battle and winning glory for their country.

<h3 id="e174">Clear Difference in Strength, Victory Already in Sight <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Although the Chinese lineup yesterday was not the strongest or sharpest, it was still far superior to the relatively unknown France team. The difference in strength was obvious, and victory was already in sight. However, in reality, while China had the advantage, France was also good at defending, and each held its own territory securely. Zhou Jiaqi, the secretary of the association, was experienced in battle and insightful into the shortcomings, so he suddenly changed the lineup in the second half, with Chen Hongguang being transferred to center forward and Xi Qiaosheng and Chen Yutian assisting him. Zhou Shaowen was reassigned to right wing. As expected, wherever the army went, the enemy collapsed, and four goals were scored, setting the victory. Zhou Xianyan's performance was amazing, and his save of the twelve-yard penalty was truly a divine save that made people cheer. Li Ning and Guan Xun'an were like impregnable iron walls, difficult for the enemy to breach. Captain Chen Pu took care of both inside and outside defense, and his contribution was great. Veteran Zhu Miao, as a returning player, fought to the end. The amazing work of the five forwards in the first half, although numerous, did not hit the key points, and was not as effective as the flexible and appropriate adaptation in the second half. Chen Yutian opened the scoring, followed by Chen Hongguang, and Chen added another goal, while Xi Qiaosheng ended the game with the final goal. The success of the last three goals was all within ten minutes of the end. French midfielder Selatuo had immense strength and was also commendable. Although the forwards were very agile, their shooting was not skillful, leading to the defeat of the entire army. Referee: Laitai.</p>
<h3 id="e175">A Kick at the Goal, All the Guests Were Startled to Their Feet <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>With three rings of the bell, the clouds of war suddenly spread. The Chinese army, taking advantage of the tailwind, advanced fiercely. It happened that there was a misunderstanding in the passing of the ball by the enemy, so China took the opportunity to enter. Chen Yutian took the lead alone, with a kick at the goal, startling all the guests to their feet. The direction was slightly wrong, and it went diagonally outside the goal. Chen Hongguang went deep alone and hit the goalpost. After China developed twice, the French army launched a combined counterattack, and Chen Pu obstructed from the middle and retreated unfavorably. Chen Hongguang and Xi Qiaosheng shot one after another, first being saved by the goalkeeper, then hitting the wooden post and failing to enter. In short, opportunities for China to shoot were everywhere, but because the field was muddy, it was not easy to kick accurately.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Unity of Effort, Whole and Unbroken Rivers and Mountains <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The French troops' arrogance suddenly increased; the left wing made frequent contributions; the three central generals were exceptionally flexible; the Chinese front line wavered. Fortunately, Li Ning, Guan Xun, and An were formidable in all directions, guarding key points, resisting the strong enemy. Zhou Xianyan was there to the ball, inseparable, so although the enemy repeatedly attacked, they remained as stable as Mount Tai. Chen Yutian broke through the encirclement in extreme danger, making a solo charge. Subsequently, Chen, with the help of Zhou Shaowen and Xi Qiaosheng, continued to make two more charges. The French troops were fully focused on defense, and nothing happened. In the first half, all parts of the country remained intact.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Breaking Through Enemy Lines, All Rejoice <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The second half began, and the Chinese team changed its formation. Not long after the kickoff, China and France lunged at each other, with dangerous moments for both sides, but without bloodshed. Ten minutes later, Chen Yutian found an opportunity to advance quickly, kicking the ball towards the goal. The goalkeeper blocked it, but Chen added another kick, breaking through the enemy's defenses. All rejoiced, congratulating Chen Yutian on his success and wishing the Chinese team victory. The enemy looked at each other in dismay, doubling their efforts, but with Zhou Xianyan's great power, they could only sigh at the goal.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Lifting Both Hands, the Iron Gate Remained Intact <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Chen Yutian tried a long-range shot, and the goalkeeper rushed forward to deflect it. The goal was wide open, and Xi Qiaosheng happened to be there, but unfortunately, he missed to the side. The French center-back dribbled the ball back on the counter-attack, and the ball touched Huang Zhaoguang's arm, resulting in a penalty kick. The French team regained hope, relying entirely on this opportunity, and chose their center forward, Collett, known for his strong and accurate kicks, to take on this important task. However, Zhou Xianyan's eyes were sharp, and his movements were agile. As the ball flew over, he lifted both hands, and the iron gate remained intact. The cheers from the audience were a hundred times louder than before, showing how delighted they were.</p>
<h3 id="e179">River Breaks Its Banks, Falls a Thousand Feet <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>After ten minutes of turbulence, the Chinese team rose again, attacking the fortress three times, lunging at the goal. With a loud bang, the ball broke through the net. The referee ruled that it had touched an enemy's hand first, so the goal was invalid, and a penalty kick was awarded. Chen Hongguang shouldered the hopes of the entire team, raised his foot, and sent the ball towards the goal. The goalkeeper blocked it forward, and Chen Hongguang followed closely, rushing into the net. After the Chinese team scored the second goal, the atmosphere improved greatly. Chen Yutian took advantage of the confusion in the opponent's defense and scored another goal. Not five minutes later, Xi Qiaosheng, in the midst of the crowd, kicked and shot, and also succeeded. The whistle for halftime sounded, and the Chinese team returned in triumph with a score of four to zero.</p>

<p>| A Crushing 23-0 Defeat of Japan</p>
<p>England is the king of the football world, having won the Shanghai International Football Championship for many years. This year's strength is still very strong. Players such as Connell (goalkeeper), Fabing, Stoke, Gaskell, Martin, Baud, Grey, Moore, Colecho, Graham, etc., are all top-notch. Japanese football skills are immature and far from being their match. The two teams competed at the Racecourse West Ball Field yesterday afternoon at 3 pm. As a result, England won by a large margin of 23-0. In the first half, the English army scored ten goals.</p>

<p>| A 3-2 Defeat of Scotland</p>
<p>| A Miracle in the Football World</p>
<p>The Jewish team and Scotland clashed at the stadium in front of the Racecourse Stone Archway yesterday afternoon at 3 pm. Scotland has always been known as a strong army, while the Jewish team has never been well-known. However, the Scottish army was defeated by the Jewish team by a score of two to three. This is truly a great change in the football world in recent years. The Scottish team players are all famous generals at sea, and most of them are players who joined the Shanghai Inter-Port team for this year's trial matches, such as Slack, Claytoner, Haile, Moro, Tolo, Scott, goalkeeper Gully, etc. In addition, there were three players from the Shicude team who recently replaced the Wases team in the battle. Their strength was very strong. Yesterday's battle was indeed a miraculous event. In the first half, the Scottish team attacked against the wind, and the momentum was still extremely powerful, but they were unable to win. Instead, they lost by a score of one to three. In the second half, they worked hard to counterattack, but to no avail, only scoring one goal. In the end, they suffered a crushing defeat by a difference of one goal.</p>

<p>| 35 to 20 |</p>
<p>Dongguang Lost to Mailing</p>
<p>14 to 46</p>
<p>The Xiqing Women's Basketball Club held a total of two games yesterday afternoon, starting at 4 pm. As a result, (1) Dongguang lost to Mailing, 14 to 46; (2) Liangjiang won over Xiqing, 35 to 20. A brief description is given below:</p>
<p>(1) Dongguang Lost to Mailing</p>
<p>Dongguang opened the scoring first. The referee blew the whistle to start the game. Although Dongguang's momentum was not as strong, they fought very fiercely. Mailing's attacks were also not easy. Guo Xiaoping flew like a swallow, and Lu Jinyao received Guo's pass, scoring a basket. Dongguang opened the scoring first. Judging from this, it seemed that Dongguang's defeat was irreparable.</p>
<p>Mailing was extremely sharp. Mailing's Ou Wen scored with a one-handed lift, also gaining one point. Cresse added another, taking the lead at 3-2. In the first and second halves, the score was 5-2. Wu Peihua missed several excellent shots under the basket. Mailing's three forwards relied on their tall stature, sweeping forward. Guo Xiaoping was transferred to defense. Wang Chunruo果 scored a basket. The result of the first half was 32-4.</p>
<p>Dongguang Ultimately Failed. In the second half, Mailing replaced Wagel as a forward and continued to gain momentum. Dongguang scored three baskets by Wu Peihua, but it was still not enough. Guo Xiaoping could not carry the burden alone. Dongguang ultimately lost to Mailing by a score of 14 to 46.</p>

<p>Xiqing was in a slump. The performance of the Xiqing Red Team yesterday was very unexpected, far worse than in the past. Former accurate shooters, such as Jie Hansheng, Harisson, and Livi克, known as the three heroes, lost opportunities dozens of times yesterday. It was not until Liangjiang scored 14 points that Xiqing opened the scoring. The result of the first half was 24-8.</p>
<p>Liangjiang continued to work hard. Liangjiang's victory seemed effortless. Xi Jun performed best among them. Shao Jinying was less impressive. Starting in the second half, Xiqing had four successful penalty shots by Jie Hansheng. Liangjiang continued to work hard, finally defeating the enemy. The result was 35-20.</p>

<p>After the German Swiss Lieshi flew a Junkers aircraft to Beijing, he tried out his skills. The movements were dangerous, and the viewers were terrified. On the 20th of the month, because Chairman Jiang had to come to observe in person, a second performance was made. That afternoon, the sky was gloomy, and the north wind howled. At about 4 pm, Chairman Jiang arrived at the Ming Palace Airfield. Director of the Aviation Department Zhang Huichang and Deputy Director Huang Bingheng had already been waiting at the airport to welcome him. He introduced the German Swiss Lieshi to Chairman Jiang to shake hands and meet. Both smiled happily. Swiss was strong and energetic, carrying an insurance umbrella and wearing thick leather flying clothes. The buttons were tightly fastened and all made of metal. After meeting, he jumped into the plane. The engine started, and he rose straight up like an arrow. After flying around once, he went straight into the clouds. He completely shut down the engine. There was no sound. He dived down, very close to the ground. He then resumed level flight. He then made a small turn of ninety degrees. He then rose again and spiraled down. He then continued to turn circles, making a small Yinmeimeng-style turn. He rose again and inverted the plane, making the wheels face up and the person upside down. He was able to maintain this for six or seven minutes. He was able to continue moving forward and make several small turns. The viewers all changed color, but he safely returned to his original state. He also performed slow flight, like a turtle. According to aviators, it is difficult to make a large aircraft with less horsepower move slowly. It is like a bicycle. To ride slowly, you must be experienced. The plane is also like this. In addition, he performed rolling flight, inverted flight, sideslip, and inverted roll one by one, and was able to fly silently in the air for more than ten minutes. High-altitude flight</p>

<p>How many pairs of clogs do I wear in a lifetime? How many times do I see the moon at its peak in a lifetime? Both are optimistic and good at words. The former is praised, and the latter is diminished. In those years, crossing the river transformed into a dragon. After the Jin and Song dynasties, Wang Jiangdong.

My friend Mao Sheng does not think so. He says that this judgment is unfair. What fault does the emperor have in his romantic affairs? No official first cried for the Ming Emperor Sizong. The old treacherous officials Ma and Ruan really misled the country. Moreover, the Hu fortune was not a human achievement. Do you not see the copper platform where the fragrance of the courtesans is thin? At the Bai Liang banquet, the concubines vied to bite the red dates. Who knows that deep drinking is not a wild banquet? It is often not in the Xianyang Palace. Do you also not see the pitiful sons of the Six Dynasties emperors? The Five Dynasties are all scoundrels who became heroes. Holding to the success or failure of this and dismissing that, the difference between Zang and Gu is like Zhuang Meng. Let me ask you about the moon above your head. Who can follow those who treat all things as discarded shoes? Therefore, I invite you to the Golden Jiao Peak. The good festival also has good companions meeting. Shao's couple Guang and Hong. I do not know if Xu is pursuing the poor. Waiting for the moon and getting rain will be no different. Returning, they all sing with a long wind. I have clogs, but I am too lazy to wax them.</p>
<p>Finished. He then performed low-altitude flight, no more than tens of feet from the airfield, circling, flying inverted, and undulating, skimming over the heads of the audience. When descending, he went straight to the aircraft hangar, and everyone thought that he would touch the top of the hangar and cause a major disaster. It was almost unbearable to look at. Who knew that as he approached the hangar, he slightly raised his head and landed safely. Alas, his skills are truly miraculous. In short, no matter what high-level flying action, he felt comfortable and handy. A huge plane, to him, was like a light withered leaf. He played with it arbitrarily without falling. On this day, everyone who watched sighed at his superb skills. Even Chairman Jiang frequently nodded in approval. It is a pity that this performance was not announced in advance. Apart from the aviation industry, most people were unaware of it. Even the newspapers rarely recorded it, so I wrote a note about it.</p>
<h3 id="e191">A Trip to Tangshan <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Meisheng</p>
<p>Dai Jun Zhiang is studying at Central University. He is kind to my daughter and husband Xu Beihong. On January 18th of the 20th year of the Republic, Dai Jun came by motorcycle and invited us to Tangshan for a trip. Everyone was happy and followed him. Those who went with him were French professor Shao Kelu, Dai Jun's friend Ding Jun, my second daughter Biwei, and grandson Boyang. The young and old totaled seven people. Tangshan is about fifty miles away from Xindu. The motorcycle can reach it in one hour. On that day, we started at 10:30 am and did not arrive until 1:30 pm because we were delayed along the way.</p>
<p>Earlier, Beihong had once gone to Qinglong Mountain, where he said there was a huge stele material, carved from a stone cliff, and one end was not different. It stood sideways on the ground, approximately sixty feet long (or wide), fourteen meters high (or wide), and four meters thick. It is truly a spectacle in the universe. According to historical research, in the Yongle dynasty of the Ming dynasty, it was planned to be used to engrave a stele of sacred virtue and divine merit. Afterwards, it did not succeed and was abandoned in the wilderness. Everyone who heard this was moved and wanted to explore its wonder. On that day, they parked the car in the village and walked to find it. Unexpectedly, it was far away. The rice paddies were muddy and slippery, and there were many thorns on the mountain path. I was particularly afraid to walk, so I stopped in the middle of the road, waiting for my companions to return and descend together. So I sat alone on a rock for more than an hour. Looking around, there was no one. There was only desolate grass and cold wind, solemn and piercing the skin to the bone. Fortunately, it was noon. If it were dusk, even the heart of Meng Ben would probably tremble with fear. After a long time, my companions finally arrived. Then we followed the path down the mountain, got into the car, and continued on. In less than twenty minutes, Tangshan was reached.</p>
<p>The mountain is named after the hot springs. In the past, it was covered with weeds and unknown to the world. It only became slightly famous since the Republic of China. As Xindu was being built, it became a scenic area. The Tangshan Club was organized by four giants, members of the National Government, etc., to provide rest and recreation during their political leisure. Outsiders were not allowed to enter. There are facilities to sell bath water for the public to bathe in, with varying levels of quality. The best is called Taolu, where you can eat and bathe. The price is slightly higher. Those with middle-class income or above often go there. When we arrived, we also entered. We were planning to order wine and choose dishes to fill our hungry stomachs, but a certain gentleman in charge of the club insisted on inviting Dai Jun, saying, "There are no guests in the club today. Since the young master has graced us with his presence, it is appropriate to entertain guests there. Don't be humble." So Dai Jun led the guests into the club and ordered lunch, a total of nine dishes. The taste was very delicious. After eating, we were invited to bathe. The place where I bathed was almost the residence of a certain giant. The carpet was soft and thick, and there were brocade couches and copper beds, almost like a first-class room in a large hotel. Inside, there was a bath pool. The pool was paved with cement and was rectangular, more than a丈long and three-fifths wide. The spring was also opened and closed with a manually operated machine, like an ordinary bathhouse, but cleaner. The temperature was suitable, and the bath was pleasant. Everyone bathed one by one. It was already early evening. We then walked to the Tangwang Temple, two miles away. The temple was narrow and unworthy of seeing, but there was a peony tree behind the hall. The branches and trunks were lush and thick, almost a hundred years old. It is a pity that we did not see the prosperous state of its flowers in bloom. To the west of the temple, there is also a hot spring pool, surrounded by short walls, with walls dividing it to separate men and women. Farmers and workers bathed there. Compared to the club, I could not help but sigh and say that the realization of equality is not easy. So we returned to the club, got into the car, and started on our way home. Before leaving, Beihong took out five coins to reward the soldiers who served us, but the gentleman in charge refused to accept it. This is enough to show the strict training of the principal, and we were really sorry. When we turned the wheels and drove quickly into the city, the city was already full of lights.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Night-Shining Wood <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Jun</p>
<p>Yesterday I visited Mr. Someone who was ill. I saw a copy of his draft work, Moving Bricks, on his desk. I borrowed it to take home. In it, there were two poems about night-shining wood, along with a preface. It is a very unusual thing. I am transcribing it for Free Talk for the study of botanists. The preface said, "When I first moved the ancestral shrine, there were four cypress trees planted. Three were flourishing, but one on the west side had been repeatedly replaced because it was dying. Last year, it was replanted again. The withered stump was removed and discarded. After more than a month, when the bark was peeled off, it suddenly glowed at night. The roots were especially bright white. My clan son Kui Jiu said, 'This is probably what is called night-shining wood.' We treasured it and stored it away carefully. In the Kangxi dynasty, night-shining wood was obtained, and the Sacred Ancestor had an imperial edict about it, which still shines in the literary world today. Later, Mr. Hua Yundi of our town, my paternal aunt's husband, was fond of Taoism in his later years. In the year of Bing Shen in the Qianlong era, he obtained night-shining wood. For a time, celebrities wrote poems and eulogies about it, almost everywhere. It was bound into four volumes, crowned with a small portrait. I read it over and over again, appreciating its jewels, and always regretted not seeing this wood. Now it has actually been produced on the site of our family's ancestral shrine, emitting the faint light of potential virtue, to magnify our clan. Is this the beginning of the omen? Therefore, I composed two poems to commemorate it." The poem said, "It is said that the luminous pearl is a rare treasure in the world. Is it not laborious to turn the mound to find it? Who knows that in the depths of the night, a foot-long piece of wood shines like a god at my door? It is said that wherever it is passed around, darkness turns to light. Everyone is surprised that it has been obtained in the human world." "I broke off a branch and carried it to Suzhou City, showing it to everyone. In the end, no one recognized it." Perhaps the star spirit pities those who read at night, so it blows the reed fire to be a lamp for books. "Moving Bricks" still exists. The author's name is not given below. It was written by someone with the surname Huang from Wuxi. Mr. Someone said,</p>

<p>6. Once Resided in Paris</p>
<p>Since the invention of sound film, people have predicted that there would be no more stage plays besides movies. Since movies can speak and sing, anything that stage plays can do, movies can also do. But movies can do things that stage plays cannot. "Donogoo" was adapted from a movie script and required a total of 27 scenes and sets. This is rare in stage plays. Only the large mechanical stage of the Pigalle Theatre can perform it. The performance of "Donogoo" is intended to expand the scope of stage play sets to compete with movies. Therefore, some say that the future of stage plays can be predicted from the success or failure of the play "Donogoo".</p>
<p>The content of "Donogoo" is roughly as follows: a man named Lamendin stands on a bridge over a river, preparing to commit suicide. A friend happens to pass by and saves him, introducing him to a psychiatrist for treatment. The doctor's prescription is to have him stand in front of the Paris Mosque at 5:45, approach the first person who passes by him wiping their nose, and dedicate his whole body and mind to that person. Lamendin follows the doctor's instructions and indeed sees the first person wiping their nose passing by at that place and time. This is Professor Yves le Tronhadec. Lamendin strikes up a conversation with the professor and follows him home. The professor tells him the thing he most hopes for: to be elected as a member of a national academy. With his qualifications as a professor, this should be quite possible. But unfortunately, he wrote in a world geography book about a city that doesn't exist. This city is purely fictional. To remedy this mistake, the non-existent city must be created. Lamendin resolutely accepts this task. He is going to create the city of Donogoo, which does not actually exist. The most complicated part of the play begins here.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Techniques to Preserve Youthful Looks, Faded Eyebrows, No Way to Prolong Life, a Golden Market for Fine Horses</p>
<p>Ren Peizhen said, "What they especially mess up themselves is using religion to deceive the people, using foolish tricks to cheat people, saying that after practicing that kind of boxing, they will be invulnerable to knives and spears. Indeed, in the past, in martial arts, they practiced a kind of 'toad strength,' where a knife would only leave a white mark when it cut. But now, tactics don't use those weapons anymore. Can you dodge bullets one by one? If you practiced martial arts that could not be penetrated by bullets, that would be a great invention. The world wouldn't need to talk about science anymore, and the country wouldn't need to run any military factories. It's a pity that those foolish people were fooled by them. It wasn't until the Allied forces entered and they died in rows from bullets that they realized, but it was already too late." Old Lin Daiyu said, "It's a little strange. I saw them recite incantations, make a strong posture, and be bare-chested. The muscles all over their bodies swelled up, and they used a big knife to chop down on their arms, but there wasn't a single scratch. A person is made of flesh and blood, not wrapped in copper and iron. Although it is said that northerners are tough guys, they never shout or beg for mercy when a knife goes in and blood comes out, but it's not easy to develop that kind of strength." Zuo Shichen said, "When we were seven or eight years old, we visited Yuanmiao Temple in Suzhou. There were many people selling their boxing skills inside. We also saw them practice that kind of toad strength. When they burst their energy, knives couldn't cut them. When we saw it at first, we also thought it was a bit strange. With our childish minds, we thought it must be a dull knife. Otherwise, if you practice this strength, even if you chop your head, you wouldn't be able to chop it off. There's no way that's true. Probably those Boxers were using these people who sold their boxing skills to create a sense of mystery and incite a group of ignorant people with their childish knowledge. I heard that they also set up an altar and worshiped some ancestral masters, teaching everyone to worship. Therefore, there were names like 'Senior Brother' and 'Second Senior Brother.' They also used the names of heroes from novels. I know that recently, books like *The Cases of Magistrate Shi*, *The Cases of Peng Gong*, and *Seven Heroes and Five Gallants* have been selling a lot in the north. After reading those books, everyone wants to be a hero. And after seeing plays, young people all want to be Huang Tianba. Unconsciously, it has deeply influenced people's hearts. With a little incitement, they cause trouble." Old Lin Daiyu said, "I've been to the altar they set up. It was in Zhuang Yu's mansion. Inside, there were yellow curtains, yellow carpets, and yellow candles. It was extraordinarily solemn. People who drink and eat meat are not allowed to step inside. Many princes and ministers went inside devoutly to kowtow and burn incense. After they caught the 'foreign devils,' they would come to the altar to present a memorial. If the memorial could be raised, the ancestral master would indicate that they were good people. If the memorial could not be raised, the ancestral master would indicate that they were bad people and they would be taken out and beheaded. When the memorials were being raised, everyone looked pale and trembled."</p>

<h3 id="e195">Fluctuations in Gold Market <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Hence, Increase Four Taels</p>
<p>Spot goods are abundant in the industry. Gold prices initially fell and then rose. The range of changes remains considerable, fluctuating between three or four taels and seven or eight taels, making it difficult to suppress. The demand from different firms varies greatly, and confidence is restored. Cantonese and Dalian firms are all buying. Taikangrun, Yuanmaoyong, and Yuanxingyong are all selling. As overseas silver markets rise slightly, gold prices immediately fall. The situation is uncertain in the morning. Exchange rates seem to ease, initially falling to 704-5 taels. Subsequently, HSBC's listed price increases by half a notch. However, the domestic market remains stable, indicating that the gold market is in an uncertain state, revolving around 710 taels. At noon, bills of exchange are still good, especially due to Hengxing's continuous dragging in, which pulls up the price. Therefore, the final market atmosphere is auspicious, quickly exceeding 715 taels. However, given the abundance of spot goods, most in the industry are generally bearish. However, the trend of exchange rates remains healthy. In short, the future of gold prices may see dramatic changes again. This morning's forecast for large bars is that there will be no special rise or fall.</p>
<p>Morning Opening Falls Four Taels: Early market for March gold opens at 707.5 taels, down four taels. This is because large bars do not change in the near term, and the forward price is long by .0625. The silver price increases by .1875, and U.S. transactions are rare, and private telegrams also increase by a quarter. Ground sees hard, and confidence weakens. There is a fluctuation of more than one tael. Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Yuda, and Yuanxingyong are all selling. Then Hengxing, Fuchang, Zhenchangxiang, and Wanxing have all bought in. Suddenly, it rebounds by more than six taels, totaling thirteen taels. Then Mitsui sells March English gold at 1.3625, and Dadecheng, Bingxing, and Wupin also sell, so the price is difficult to stabilize. Downstream, it plummets by more than eight taels in ten minutes, suddenly falling to 704 taels and 5 mace. Hengxing and others enter, and it immediately rises by more than five taels. Around 9:30, it is 710 taels. The initial announcements have increased by .125, U.S. dollars by .25, and Japanese gold has fallen by 1.25 fen, so it retreats to .085 taels. Then it depreciates by more than one tael, totaling .07 taels. Internal exchange rates are flat. Foreign firms settle this month's U.S. dollars with Mitsui at $31.4375 and June at $31.5625. However, the gold market has shown a declining trend. Then, between 708 and 711 taels, various firms buy and sell differently. At 10:00, Yuancheng and retail investors sell, so it falls to .075 taels.</p>
<p>Head Covering Pursued and Pulled Up: Later, Robi and Zhengjin jointly trade April English gold at 1.3625. Then HSBC absorbs the same price for May. In particular, Hengxing, Shunli, Wanxing, and others buy in succession. However, prices fluctuate by two or three taels. At 10:45, there is a sudden increase of seven or eight taels, almost like advancing a thousand miles in a day. At 10:50, it is 15 taels. However, there are few transactions at this price, and it is immediately suppressed by more than one tael. Then there is still one tael of advance and retreat. After 11:00, the sellers seem to be moving, but the exchange market is still strong. Mitsui and HSBC jointly trade May English gold at 1.3625. By 11:30, it has fallen to more than .07 taels. After entering, banks trade with each other for April at 2.35625. HSBC also absorbs May at .625. On the surface, Yufengyong, Hengxing, and head covering firms are pursuing purchases, creating a strong momentum. In just over ten minutes, it jumps beyond eight taels. At noon, it reaches 16 taels. By the time of the noon close, it totals 715 taels and 5 mace. Compared to the previous day, it has risen by four taels. The maximum price in half a day is 16 taels, and the minimum price is .045 taels, totaling a difference of 11 taels and 5 mace. The early market for Wupin is .08 taels, and the noon close is 15 taels. The listed price has been changed to 772 taels and 2 mace. The listed price for Japanese gold has fallen slightly by 1.25 fen, totaling a deduction of 64-5 taels. At noon, it is 56-7 taels. Book entry is 11 taels to 16 taels. Water supplementation is 11 taels. Ornament gold is exchanged at $99.</p>
<p>Market Transactions: Inflows and Outflows are Numerous: Transactions by various firms are still active, but mixed and uncertain. Yuanmaoyong, Zhifengyong, Yongfeng, Dadecheng, and Taikangrun are generally selling the most. Yuda, Yuanxingyong, Yuancheng, and Fuxingyong are also selling. Yuanhengfu, Wanxing, Shunli, Yuantai, Yufengyong, and Zhenchangxiang are all buying in. Hengxing has an especially strong desire to buy (taking a long position). Head covering inflows and outflows for Wupin are numerous. Dalian firms total several thousand bars, with purchases accounting for two-thirds. Cantonese firms add to their long positions by 2,000 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Exchange Rate Continues to Increase by Half a Notch <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the English and American silver markets rose slightly, and transactions were rare. Both English and American exchange rates rose. Yokohama and Kobe markets remained flat and dull. For the exchanges listed by HSBC, they have increased by half a notch. English gold is .125, now at 1 shilling 3 pence .25. U.S. dollars increase by .25, totaling $30.0875. Indian exchange increases by .75, totaling 85.5 rupees. French francs increase by 7 yuan, totaling 787 yuan. German exchange increases by 1 yuan, totaling 129.75 marks. Dutch currency increases by half a yuan, totaling 76.5 guilders. Singapore exchange decreases by 1.75 taels, totaling 182 taels. Hong Kong is still counted as 77 taels. Japanese gold then decreases by 1.25 fen, totaling 1 tael 6 mace .025. The domestic market for shillings and others is relatively stable. The early market seems to ease, but then gold prices turn from weakness to strength, so it also tightens. It is said that foreign firms and the National Government are settling accounts one day early because the 25th falls on a holiday. Therefore, yesterday, banks had a strong desire to buy. By the noon close, it was not much different from the previous day. Chinese merchants in the gold industry were generally selling the most. There were occasional head covering gold prices. English gold transactions totaled over 200,000 pounds. Zhengjin, Mitsui, Maihang, and HSBC all absorbed. The various banks also mutually traded 100,000 pounds. HSBC purchased the most. Foreign firms also settled $200,000 in U.S. dollars. Mitsui sold short positions. There were not many Japanese gold transactions. Only Mitsui absorbed slightly. Now Dalian is selling by Dalian firms. Because it was Saturday afternoon, there were no market conditions.</p>
<p>There was a fluctuation of .125 in the domestic English exchange market in half a day. From a morning price of 1 shilling 3 pence .5625 for March and .625 for April, the buying price was increased by .0625. Zhengjin first absorbed 5,000 pounds for April at .625 in the morning. Joseon and Meifeng jointly traded 10,000 at .5625. Mitsui sold 5,000 for March at .625 and absorbed 5,000 for April at .6875. Then after 9:30, it absorbed 5,000 for January at the same price and 5,000 for March at .625. Maihang entered 5,000. Huabi exited, and Zhengjin entered 10,000 for April. HSBC entered 20,000 for May at the same price of .625, so the price of gold immediately broke through 700 taels. Then Mitsui and HSBC jointly traded 10,000 at .625. Datong and Mitsui jointly traded 10,000 for this month at 1.35. Sino-French and Sumitomo jointly traded 10,000 for April at .5625. HSBC absorbed another 10,000 for May after 11:30 at .625. The noon close offered a price of .4375 for March and a buying price of half a penny. April offered a price of half a penny and a buying price of .5625.</p>
<p>There was a difference of .25 in the domestic U.S. exchange market. The morning price for January and March was $31.50, and for April, $31.625. The buying price was $31.75. Mitsui sold to foreign firms approximately 100,000 for January at $31.4375, March at $31.50, and June at $31.5625. The noon close offered prices of $31.25 for January and March and $31.375 for April. The buying price was increased by .125.</p>
<p>There was a difference of 1.5 fen in the domestic Eastern exchange market in half a day. The morning price for January was 1 tael 5 mace 7 fen, and for March, 1 tael 5 mace 6.5 fen. The buying price was reduced by 1 fen. However, transactions were scattered. Around 11:00, Mitsui absorbed 100,000 for Dalian at 1 tael 5 mace 6 fen .75. By the time of the noon close, the offered price for January was 1 tael 5 mace 8 fen .5, and the buying price was 7 fen .5. The offered price for March was 1 tael 5 mace 7 fen .75, and the buying price was 6 fen .75.</p>

<p>The yarn market is quite firm, with rising momentum due to sellers' panic and reduced inventory. With gold prices high, Third Grade Yarn exceeds Chinese Yarn by dozens of taels, so manufacturers and gold traders are aggressively buying and adding to their positions. Today, they purchased several thousand more bales. Major traders are looking at a distant month of 165 taels. However, current yarn sales are not particularly smooth, so some are bearish. In the afternoon, the third round of gains intensified, and sellers showed signs of losing control. The March price was called at 160 taels, indicating that short positions were panicking. Later, Xincheng released some long positions, and the close eased slightly.</p>
<p>Human Bid Dafeng Short Covering: The pre-market opening for human bids was flat with U.S. cotton, and the market was calm. Prices fell by 6-7 qian each. In the second and third rounds, major short positions were offset, and the market suddenly rose by more than 1 tael, ultimately rising by 3, 6, 7, and 8 qian. In the afternoon, Dafeng covered a large number of short positions, and the market became even tighter, with prices rising by 1 tael 3-4 qian and 6-8 qian. Total daily transactions were 70,550 bales. Bought in Dafeng 4,800 bales, Rongxing 4,400 bales, Daji 2,850 bales, Changfeng 2,150 bales. Sold out Gongtai 2,650 bales, Xincheng 1,650 bales, Jifeng 1,350 bales, Tianyuan 1,750 bales, Ruidi 1,350 bales, and Gengfeng 1,450 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Yarn Sales are More Active: Current yarn sales are more active. Statistics show that all firms purchased 1,300 bales throughout the day. Counterparts bought 325 bales. Market prices rose by more than 1 tael. Among customers, 340 bales were purchased for the inland, 45 bales for Xiamen, 25 bales for Guangdong, 125 bales for Tianjin, 60 bales for Shantou, 400 bales for Sichuan, 100 bales for Hankou, 50 bales for Xuzhou, and 70 bales for miscellaneous firms.</p>

<p>The cotton market is very strong. However, the U.S. cotton situation is flat. With the release of Gandhi, it is generally expected that Indian cotton will rise, so most are psychologically bullish and buying. If exchange rates do not change dramatically, the cotton market will still be difficult to be bearish.</p>
<p>Han Biao Buying Momentum High: The pre-market opening for Han Biao was flat. As U.S. cotton showed mixed gains and losses, the second round was slightly higher. As a result, each month rose by 5 fen. In the afternoon, with yarn prices rising sharply, the cotton market was driven up, and major traders also took short positions, with each rising by 1 qian 5 fen to 2 qian. Total daily transactions were 147,000 dan. Sold out Shenda 5,700 dan, Gengfeng 3,100 dan, Gongtai 8,800 dan, Yiyu 3,900 dan, and Minghua 3,300 dan. Bought in Dafeng 12,800 dan, Tianlong 5,500 dan, and Ruidi 6,100 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>A dispatch from New York on the 23rd reported on raw cotton for the week: The cotton market showed a slight downward trend at the beginning of the week, but was soon halted by increased demand from peers. A portion of this was due to increased orders for Japanese cotton cloth due to the Lancashire mill strike. There was also buying in Europe and domestically, which led to new short positions covering their positions. They were wary of the market remaining so firm despite weak current demand. During the price increase, Southern supplies showed a slight improvement, but all sales were absorbed. The Lancashire labor unrest is unresolved, and the Liverpool market remains stable. Egyptian cotton is also firm, which is also a reason for optimism. The price difference between New York and Liverpool is currently quite large. It seems that the overall trend will readjust the price difference in the global market, or it may be a sign of possible export demand in the spring and summer seasons. However, the demand for inventory replenishment in various countries is not currently urgent. Attachment: Statistics as follows, in thousands of bales.</p>

<p>Ordinary Grades Fall Again by 20 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of river boats in Zhabei was still strong, with over 70 boats arriving. The reason for the recent surge is that they were previously affected by wind and snow and were delayed en route. Currently, various inland waterways have gradually become clear, so the accumulated rice boats have arrived simultaneously. Therefore, the source of these later arrivals may decrease. Sales by various guilds in the market yesterday were still sluggish. Genuine high-grade japonica rice was scarce, so it remained on the left side of the 14 yuan mark, while ordinary grades fell again by 20 cents. The situation will depend on the weather. If it turns cloudy, then it may be able to stand firm for a day or two. Indica rice has suffered a setback, and the market has also fallen slightly. Sheep indica rice is indeed scarce, so although sales are sluggish, prices remain flat. Du indica rice lacked buying interest in both the port and pointed grades, and prices were set high with subsequent cuts. Specially variable yuan rice was selling well, with prices requiring 13 yuan 78 cents, while secondary grades required a cut of more than 10 cents. With both shaded and transformed arrivals seeing slow sales, the market presented a fluctuating picture. Throughout the day, various conditions have shifted to an increased trend of price cuts.</p>
<p>Yesterday, over 30 rice boats arrived in Shanghai South, with sales lacking. Common guild large market white japonica rice was wholesaled for 15 cents. Top-grade goods were being given away, and the market was flat. Suzhou former white japonica retail sales were extremely sluggish, and with ample river storage, they became increasingly depressed, falling by 10 to 20 cents each. The trend of indica rice from various locations in the South Road became increasingly weak, with a total drop of 50 cents in recent days. Currently, the special high-grade indica rice is only opening at 11 yuan. Although the sources of sheep and Du pointed grade rice were received, the bottom-grade goods were depleted, so the market was still able to maintain the original price. Variable shaded yuan rice was sluggish and lifeless, with top-grade goods in the market appearing stable, and medium-grade unified repairs being just left of 10 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Further Shipments of Guangdong Rice from Jiangxi <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for guest indica rice showed that the source of Jiangxi rice was relatively scarce, and the local appetite was very sluggish. Although there were inquiries from the guest guild, market prices had already softened by several cents. Only Hunan rice and Nanjing rice had low arrivals and storage, so the market was still able to stand firm. Yesterday, the Guangdong guild's appetite was still good, purchasing over 2,000 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice, with prices slightly softer, selling at 11 yuan 57 cents to 11 yuan 20 cents. The Ningbo guild purchased 220 bags of Hunan red rice at a price of 10 yuan 01 cent. The local street only purchased over 400 bags of brown rice, with Nanjing brown rice at 8 yuan 50 cents to 8 yuan 45 cents, and Willow brown rice at 8 yuan 80 cents. There were no other transactions reported.</p>
<h3 id="e207">The Flour Market Continues to Show Signs of Slackness <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, all months showed signs of fatigue. With the quotation for foreign wheat falling by another 10 to 20 cents, people's minds were already softening. In the afternoon, it was further rumored that foreign firms were again offering foreign wheat to factories and dealers. According to private sources, Australian white wheat was again shouting down to Shen yuan 4 taels, or it was rumored that Fuxin's order was only 3 taels 9 qian and 5 fen (handled by Mitsui and Longmao), totaling around 20,000 tons. Therefore, short sellers in the market were actively moving, and factories were also enthusiastically hedging. With foreign wheat arriving one after another, it is finally difficult to see a turnaround in the market in the future. As a result, this month was down 1 cent from the previous day, February was down 7.5 li, and March to June were each down 1.5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Fall in Forward Wheat Prices is Particularly Severe <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the forward wheat market in the morning and afternoon, each month presented a picture of initial firmness followed by a decline. Although the quotation for foreign wheat fell in the morning, short sellers took the opportunity to enter, so it did not fall but instead improved. January and February were better by 1 to 2 cents than the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the price of the continued foreign wheat order was cheaper, and the quantity was better. Those belonging to the dealer naturally offered it to the market, causing the forward months to decline like a river, without looking back. According to this kind of scene, the forward standard may have to pass through the 4 tael mark before there is a day of return. As a result, this month fell 2 cents from the previous day, February fell 3 cents, March, April and May each fell 5 cents, and June fell 4 cents. There has been no trading of spot wheat due to factory inaction.</p>
<h3 id="e209">The Rising Trend of Standard Soybeans Turns Fierce <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Future Bean Cakes Slightly Followed Suit</p>
<p>Yesterday, the standard soybean market was selling well. The morning opening market was only slightly good. Later, due to the fact that various guilds had to cover their recent holdings, the situation gradually tightened. At the afternoon opening, dealers and the Great Dalian Private Telegram reported high prices, and customers from Lianbang frequently inquired. Each month's futures market was gradually firm. This month, due to the upcoming delivery, spot soybeans were selling extremely well, and arrivals were slightly stable, so people's minds improved. Therefore, near-term buying interest turned strong, and the rising trend became fierce. Although a small number of guest guilds sold off the distant months, they also followed the upward trend. At the close, January futures were up 7 cents, February futures were up 5 cents, March futures were up 4 cents, and April and May were each up 2 cents.</p>
<p>The futures bean cake market initially felt firm, and then there was inland support, which was quickly secured. Continued to rise due to rising raw materials and reports of Lianxun's high prices, but there were not many transactions in the morning and afternoon sessions, so the market only showed signs. As a result, February and June each rose by 1 cent, April rose by 1 cent and 2 li, and May rose by 7 li and 5 hao.</p>

<p>Glutinous rice branches have seen a slight easing in market prices in recent days due to a decline in sales. Inquiries have shown that dealers still have stock, and there are also shipments arriving. The former price for Chung Chong goods was 84 to 85 taels, now it is 82 to 83 taels, a decrease of 2 to 3 taels from before. There has been little trading in the inland areas of the local street recently. The former price for high-grade goods was 90 taels, but it has also decreased.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local Shanghai foreign firm silk market remained strong. It was found that overseas silk telegrams for both yellow and white silk had been transferred to Shanghai, and various manufacturers were very reluctant to sell due to insufficient inventory. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson etc. imported 20 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, Sinfu imported 10 packages of Lu yellow factory silk, and Mei Da imported 8 packages of coarse yellow silk, with prices all firm.</p>

<p>In Preparation for Delivery to Foreign Firms at the End of the Month</p>
<p>Various silk factories in Wuxi have undertaken to throw this month's futures silk. Because the end of the month is approaching, they are actively reeling silk and transporting it to Shanghai in batches in preparation for delivery to foreign firms. Yesterday, a Shanghai-Wuxi passenger train again loaded 75 cases of white factory silk, all of which were picked up by various Shanghai silk brokers to be delivered.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Piece Goods and Foreign Red Labels See a Sharp Increase <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>The trend of local factory cloth was slightly soft yesterday, probably because the Lunar New Year is approaching, and local customers are showing a closing trend, so sales have slowed. All goods that are mortgaged with silver are willing to sell, resulting in fine cloth first falling by about 5 cents yesterday. Yanghe, Caiqiu, and Laba Tong were all 6 taels 9 qian and 5 fen, blue Double Fish was 7 taels and 5 fen, 11-pound blue Sun was 6 taels 5 qian, and 12-pound blue Chicken was 6 taels 8 qian and 2.5 fen. Fine twill was also slightly down, with Yanghe at 7 taels 3 qian and 2.5 fen, and blue Double Fish at 7 taels. However, 9-pound coarse cloth continued to rise, actually because of a lack of spot goods. Yesterday, Five Bats reached 4 taels 4 qian and 5 fen, Cat Owl was 4 taels 4 qian and 2.5 fen, 11-pound goods remained flat, 13-pound Double Eagle opened at 6 taels, coarse twill was quite stiff, Two Fish sold for 5 taels 4 qian, Three Rabbit was 5 taels 3 qian and 7.5 fen, and Cat Owl had no goods.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western piece goods saw more declines than increases, actually because the date of total closing is not far away. The local street was already very quiet yesterday, and customers' searches were also slow, so people's minds were softening. Yesterday, the black flower, water wave, and bleached flannel of the Eastern goods all fell, each by a small 2.5 li. The concubine color cotton and French flannel of Yijianjian also gradually fell. Yesterday, Yang Guifei color was 2 qian and 2 fen, Wumeiren red was 2 qian and 2.5 fen. Fine serge was softer with the Sanyou Tu of Tu Yuan, opening at 3 qian and 1.5 fen, and the rest remained firm. Spot tribute cloth was still lacking, and foreign red labels actually increased. Yesterday, it opened at a new high price never seen before, with 6-pound Guo Ju at 4 taels 9 qian and 5 fen, Santan Yin Yue Qiao at 4 taels 8 qian and 5 fen, and 4-pound Guo Ju reaching 4 taels 2 qian and 5 fen. Changing the brand also required 4 taels to pass through customs.</p>
<h3 id="e214">The Oil Market, Tung Oil Continues to Rise <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of white tung oil soared, the Hong and Xiu oils, which are suitable for production areas, are just at the time of closing and starting crushing. The fundamental impact of the futures market is inevitable. It is obvious that the future cost will inevitably be high. However, since the autumn, Xiu oil has arrived in one batch, and there has been no source for a long time. When it arrived, it happened to be at the time when white tung oil plummeted, so it has repeatedly fallen in price. Sanxiu, comprising Zhongwei, Wanxingyu, and Dayouheng, has fallen from 29 taels and 6 qian to 25 taels, a total of 4,000 to 5,000 pieces, which have been sold as prices have fallen. Therefore, there are only a few hundred pieces left in the local area. It is reported that Jifengheng and Jitaiheng have recently arrived in Hankou with 2,000 to 3,000 pieces. According to the voices of the purchasing customers, Jifengheng must sell for 30 taels, and Jitaiheng must sell for 28 taels, both of which are flourishing. If this is compared to the recent decline in the Shanghai market, it must be increased by one or two taels. The various dealers are unwilling to increase prices because the goods have already been sold, so naturally, those with goods in hand must increase prices and sell if they encounter a buyer. After the addition of Hongjiang oil, inland areas have sold a lot before the establishment of unified taxes. The price of Qingyuanfeng and Fuhong from 1919 is 19 taels 6 qian, and the goods from 1918 can be reduced by 2 to 3 taels. The same brand has such a large price difference due to the year, which is also a novel phenomenon. Yang Hengyuan's Fuhong requires 19 taels and 8 qian, and other brands have varying prices. The approximate range is from 19 taels to 18 taels and a few cents, while Xiang Taifeng and Jifengying have the lowest price of 21 taels, and there are not many goods. Yesterday, the market repeatedly increased the price of white tung oil, so various ports in Beijing increased the price by 6 qian. It is said that it will need to be increased again.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: 30,000 bags of Wuhu white rice will be shipped to Guangzhou immediately. 860 cases of French foreign wine arrived yesterday. 240 cases of woolen fabrics and silk fabrics arrived from Paris. 6,200 bags of East Sugar have been imported. 160 cases of paint came from England. 1.3 million feet of lumber came from America. 970 pieces of iron wire were shipped from Europe. 460 pieces of machinery came from London. 1,000 pieces of glass came from Dalian. 3,600 boxes of tea were loaded in Hankou.</p>
