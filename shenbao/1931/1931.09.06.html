<h3 id="c33">中國經濟學社當前之鉅責（四） <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>（五）在上文吾人曾一提及中國社會經濟確如一大謎此大謎之外表現象爲技術程度與經濟形式極爲複雜技術上最新式之設備然洪荒時代之生產工具同時並存有製造汽船之船塢製造電泡之工廠而亦有千百萬手工業生產工具之木織機有飛機汽車汽船而亦有馬車人力車以至極粗笨之單輪車有木造之犁鋤及滯笨之水車亦有最新式之深耕機器及電機灌溉複雜之生產技術自反映社會内部殘存各種各式之生產關係與社會經濟層次然而無論其如何複如何混亂吾人從世界上全體國家聨結成爲整個經濟單位及資本主義在中國發展之現象而觀握有中國經濟之領導權者直可確定爲資本主義經濟</p>
<p>然就此遂謂中國經濟與世界資本主義國家經濟無以異乎是又不然吾人旣已從一般法則中把握中國社會發展之歷史性與規律性尤應從特殊條件之認識中把握其發展之畸形性變態與不平衡性質言之即中國經濟之特質資本主義經濟雖已提挈中國經濟走上資本主義之道路但宗主國與殖民地之關聨則亦同時建立即先進國在整個方面推動資本主義經濟之成分前途而在另一方面則桎梏中國經濟使其不能向民族資本主義之道途上發展同時因爲中國民族資本原始積累之薄弱國内大部分資本主義生產技術多靠外國供給故民族工業不能發展尤其是重工業不能與先進國並駕齊驅顯呈落後現象原料爲先進國所攘奪市塲爲先進國所佔據經濟爲先進國所操縱工業爲先進國所把持在經濟上成爲不自主故中國資本主義經濟雖在數量上與質量上都有若干酷肖之點但中國經濟究自有其特質在次之中國在經濟上旣不能自主而支配中國經濟者則又不僅一國先進資本主義國家在中國各有其特權地此與印席之單獨被統治於英國韓國之單獨被統治於日本又各不同故中國適成爲次殖民地資本主義經濟復次中國封建經濟基礎雖已崩潰然其殘餘勢力則尙有若干存留復常起消極之反抗作用以阻碍資本主義在中國發展之步武故中國資本主義經濟之發展乃愈覺其迂滯就上所述中國資本主義經濟以殘存封建勢力之障旣不能放步直前以國際資本主義之束縛復不能進入民族資本主義經濟之前途吾人對於中國經濟應從此兩點上把握其特質</p>
<p>（六）中國經濟之前途爲何即中國將往何處去此問題爲中國當前这緊急問題吾人認爲四循於現狀則姑無論目前即無此自存第二次世界大戰一起中國必將因之而堕入更悲慘之命運遵循資本主義之道途百盲目前進則近世資本主義經濟已顯呈没落之現象遵循其舊軌適足以同歸於没落之陷阱其他就事實之障礙與環境上之暗礁而言又絕不容依附於蘇聨社會主義經濟之系統孫中山先生於此曾照示吾人以光明之大道對内以土地革命剷除封建殘餘使中國經濟得以大踏步向前發展對外則以民族革命打破國際資本主義之束縛使中國經濟得以自主自立而其歸趨則爲非資本主義即社會主義之民生主義經濟之前途</p>
<p>吾人對於上述六項問題之解答意見如斯但此種關係國家與民族前途之根本問題自應由專家綜合實在之事實加以詳盡之研究以其所得貢獻於當局使我國家得以確定其前途確定應付現狀打破現狀之經濟政策此鉅大之責任實非經濟學社諸君子莫屬吾人深盼經濟學社諸君子茲後向此方向而切實努力以沉毅之精神立於上述根本問題之正面不迴避不踏空努力擔負此偉大之使命</p>

<p>▲兩艙浸水今次巴琴蘭德號輪、係由大沽青島各埠、裝齊貨物後、赴日本神戶、行至高麗海面寳介沙島觸礁、該輪頭二兩艙之底、均爲礁石洞破、海水漫浸兩艙、貨物盡遭水漬、損失極大、幸各艙係間隔構造、致他艙未遭波及、而船體不致下沉、</p>
<p>▲旅客救出該輪失事後、滬行正擬派輪往救、已經商准會德豐派一拖輪、並命行員一人、同往視察、旋得日本輪代發一電來滬、謂巴琴蘭德擱礁以後、在下午七時許、適值本埠大阪公司之大連班郵船貝干爾丸Baikar　Maru赴日、經過該地、即上前助救、德輪中有上海乘該輪赴華北東洋周游之西人旅客二十五人、在出事後頗爲恐慌、遂輕貝干兩丸旅舢板下海、將此二十五客救上日輪、送至神戶、再乘他輪返滬、旅費由亨寳認付、</p>

<p>滬上聞人。近有曾李同門曾之組織。并擬刋布曾李兩先生之作品。以便流傳。洵屬一大佳事。偶憶清道人嗜蟹成癖。有李百蟹之號。時道人跼處海上。秋風勁。紫蟹初肥。欲快朶頣。苦於囊澀。無已。乃繪蟹百小幅。聊以解饞。蟹均染墨爲之。不加色澤。然韻昧酣足。神來之筆也且加跋語。頗雋趣。被其友馮秋白所覩。大爲賞識。乃特赴蘇購陽澄湖金毛團臍蟹三大筐貽之。用以換畫。清道人得蟹欣然。竟割愛與以百幅秋白遂榜其書室曰百蟹齋。以示珍異。聞秋白於去歲浮海而東赴台灣。以營商業。此百蟹圖未知曾挾往異域否。否則大可謀假之以付鋟也。清道人固以書名者。畫不過以餘緒爲之耳。曩歲心漢閣主人。與故書畫名宿翁印若先生。於吳中護龍街某骨董肆見有清道人一聊。印若亟稱精品。心漢主人乃以五金易之。聨爲七言句。（高步正齊韓魏國。奇文何異蔡中郎。）有上欵（際雲。）主人殊不愜意。忽想及予字際雲。即以是聨爲贈。曰君字際雲。是聨不可不由君歲之。予至今尙張之紙帳銅瓶室中。翹首燕雲。甚感主人之厚饋也</p>

<p>不碎的玻璃西方人向有一種迷信。據說打碎玻璃一方。就有七年的厄運。因此好多年來。有許多科學家都在設法發明打不碎的玻璃。最近美國加利福宜州工藝學院。Californian　Institute　Technology中。有兩位少年科學家。已經發明成功。不過製造的方法。還是秘而不宣。至於歐州方面。也製成了一種軟玻璃。大半是用菜蔬化合而成。形狀與眞的玻璃無異。而能像紙張一般捲將起來。任是抛擲拗折。不會破碎。</p>
<p>▲汽車不肇禍的奬勵　世界諸大都會中。汽車如雲。肇禍傷人。是常有的事。奥國首都的維也納汽車俱樂部Vienna　Auto-mobile　Club有鑒於此。特地製備奬章多種。可以綴在鈕上。挿在車上。分别奬與一般開汽車的。獎章也分有等級。在十五年内從未肇禍從未罰　的得頭等。十年的得二等。五年的得三等。一般有汽車的人。都以得此爲榮。（海客）</p>

<p>蜀省僻處西陲。山川險阻。號稱蠶　。東有瞿塘三峽之險。北有劍閣棧道之阻。南接黔蠻。西連康藏。物產殷阜。萬山重疊。洵四臺之區。天府之國也。有史以來。屢爲英雄割據之地。勝清末造。卒以川路事變。引起革命。遂覆清室。趙爾豐·端方·皆爲川人所殺。項城當國。先後遣吳光新·陳宦入蜀。皆失敗而還。至今仍成羣雄割據之勢。古人謂蜀道之難。難於上青天。吾謂治蜀之難。難於上青天也。昨於友人家中有客自成都還者。敂以蜀省内幕。客乃喟然嘆曰。巴蜀。化外之地也。自宜昌以西。至於重慶。爲劉湘防地。成都則爲劉文輝勢力範圍。川北則爲鄧錫侯地盤。故吾人之游川省者。必須納數回之稅。前年秋。予道經萬縣。檢查極嚴。偶於篋中見有絲襪兩雙。欲徵以稅。予謂人不能祗備絲襪一雙。必須換易也。檢查者怒曰。襪固川中可購者。胡備二雙爲。在律必當稅也。予祗得納之。其稅之苛。概可知焉。至今鐵器諸物。且懸爲厲禁。謂鐵乃製造内亂之原料。禁鐵所以遏亂萌也。凡在蜀中擁兵一旅一團者。其權力雖南面王不若。然蜀中雖四分五裂。而一遇外力侵入。則急起團結以禦外。而以（亡省）兩字。大聲疾呼相號召。其精神不翅東鄰倭人也。故民國以來。入蜀者莫不失敗而還。及外力旣去。則又自相火迸。以競　角之權利。然昔在楊森未失勢時。頗知建設。今則成都大道。負山面江。康莊平坦。風景幽勝。令人神往不寘窴焉。</p>

<p>我國此次水災。蔓延至十六行省之廣。受禍之慘。報紙疊有記載。無煩縷舉不過水患之來。勢不可測。即歐洲平時考究防水之國家。亦未必能盡免汎濫横流之禍。近之如去年三月法國南部巨水成災。被淹區域。多至十三區。當時法總統聞耗。即親往災區。慰問救濟。與現在蔣主席之蒞漢視察。其情形正相同也。茲將去歲歐洲報紙所載。擷譯若干。藉見彼邦人士救護之熱烈。似未始非借鏡之一助耳。</p>
<p>法國南部一帶河流。通地中海及大西洋。在去歲二月下旬。連朝霪雨。水流之速。勢如奔馬。轉瞬之間。兩岸陡漲。積水至八呎之深。又據磨斯克居民傳說。祇五分鐘間。水勢湧起。已由下層高逹二樓。斯際各區無綫電臺。遂紛紛報告水患。此消息傳至巴黎。一時全城居民。莫不驚惶失色。若大禍之在眉睫焉。</p>
<p>法都人士。處此驚濤駭浪之頃。其救濟手段。亦殊可佩。彼於三日内。所有巴都附近無論屬於官營或私有之馬托船航輪等盡數加入於往來救護災民事業。各區總計。約及數千艘之衆。而巴黎商會召開緊急會議。一日夜間。所得各處糧食現金賑欵已逹五千萬佛郎以上。其餘各城市來電輸助者。尙不在内焉。計法之水患。四星期而秩序大致恢復。自助之精神。誠有足多者。現在我國水患。待賑嗷嗷。迫不及待。救人即以自救。述此殊深望各界之踴躍輸將也。</p>

<p>拳術之發源。自嵩山少林始。蓋梁武帝時逹摩東來。駐錫於嵩山。發明易筋經·技擊·拳脚多套·厥後寺僧之優良者。得其眞傳。累代相承。樹立少林一派。推爲鼻祖。其功固優於古代禽獸諸術。迨宋代趙太祖匡胤。研有心得。倡授技學。遂傳有常拳門。茶拳門。洪拳門。華拳門。砲拳門等之類别。唯各有八段功一套。功各有異。大可殺敵。小克養身。故少林爲拳術之總匯。不啻川流之源也。吾吳李繼勛。年少英俊。長於技擊。童年即受敎於馬鈺山之門。馬爲中央國術館評判委員。學擅少林茶拳。久已蜚譽南北。技擊健將也。李迺登堂入室。薰陶有素。進程之速。幾有青出於藍之勢。近應本埠某校之聘。日前同志歡迎於葉園。酒酣之餘。李循同志之請。表演少林二十四史一套。爲一百零八手。頗見精彩。於手眼身法步五點。無不周至。演來呼呼生風。繼演八段功一套。尤爲特色。兩臂骨骱間。格格有聲。肌膚堅硬似鐵。自始至終。無懈可擊。余門外漢。祇見其活潑如猿。蹤躍淩空。不敢妄加評判。據内家云。此茶拳八段功。動作較其他拳術多且難。若非練之精奥。曷克臻斯神化。誠可謂後起之秀矣</p>

<p>或謂饒漢祥爲樊增祥弟子。入民國。應黎元洪聘。充鄂軍府秘書。　　民政長。未詳考也·漢祥湖北廣濟人。非雲門弟子。鄂之耆宿如楊惺吾（守敬）輩。學問道德皆駕雲門而上。師事之人彌多。詎鄂人必俱出雲門下而始有光譽。殊未盡然。漢祥未逹時。以鹽大使聽鼓八閩。抑鬱不得志。提學仁和姚文倬覽其詩文而異之。延入其家。授子女讀。因不凍　。齋照岩（躍珊）備兵漢黄德。某太史一言薦之。珊屬草公牘數篇定臧否。祥盡一夕之力而成。珊睹稿冷笑曰。是奚足爲吾椽屬耶。竟不獲用。語聞於祥。長嘆而已。辛亥秋。黄陂建牙武昌。首以網羅人材爲亟務。一時宿儒名士聞風而集者衆。祥方任財政司科員。擬一稿。科長擲諸地。祥不能堪。欲拂袖去。耆宿某器其才。白於黄陂曰。共和初基。人才難得。吾鄂有似陸敬輿其人者。正屈爲下僚。不求人知。人亦罕知之。公盍羅致爲己用。差比於晋公之於昌黎也。黄陂大喜。禮延入幕。祥居恒熟讀宣公集。所爲公牘。摹擬略似。累爲黄陂草長文。以電逹天下。纏綿悱惻。哀感動人。類皆天下人所欲言。而不敢言者。於是國人心理不期趨於江漢之間。黄陂聲譽因以漸著。遂以祥領袖幕僚。薦授内務司長。擢省長。已而黄陂爲項城誘入京師。留居小蓬萊。祥亦鬱憤而退。僅得參政之名。迨黄陂正位白宫。祥貳貳秘書處事。其長丁佛言（世嶧）旣去。乃繼其任。以事忤黄陂。黄陂再起。祥無所事事。金永炎偶言其貧。謂故人泰半膺膴仕。極峯獨不念宓僧耶。宓僧。祥字也。黄陂動容。爰筆書帮忙秘書四字眎永炎。永炎出以語祥。祥亟詣謁。黄陂辭以疾。固請。始獲見。祥嗚咽曰。生我者父母。活我者總統。帮辦雖間散。亦喫著不盡。黄陂莞爾。曰、子乃久共患難。事非參與密勿。予知過矣。子且竢之。不三日。秘書長令下。黄陂顧哈漢章曰。予豈欲屈宓僧耶。稍挫其剛銳之氣而已。胡君朝宗嘗舉其始末以告余。朝宗黄陂人。與祥比肩事黄陂者。其言當可信也。乙丑。郭松齡之叛。祥幾以身殉。對人曰。松齡曾屈膝乞其爲擬討張檄。婉辭謝絕。齡怒曰。安知我他日不爲元首。言烈而諷。吾知指恉。含憤從戎。未至若林長民者幸耳。齡叛後一年。謡傳張漢卿（學良）令捕之。實無其事。祥懼。以書抵學良辨誣。洋洋近萬言。張復牋慰之。亦數千語。蓋余手製稿。嗟乎。世之懷才藻而不得志於時者。觀於漢祥。毋自憂戚也。</p>

<p>（怎麽樣？李先生至早也得三點鐘才回來，我在這一個月内，開門是開慣的了。外邊風大雪深，李太太你回去吧！我給你候着，李先回來了，我伴到你們大門口，你放心吧！待我先鎖上了門，先送李太太回家，可好？）閽捕操着半上海白問李夫人。</p>

<p>（還是到家裏候着的好，杍細受了凉，李太太！）閽捕嘴裏這麽說，但是他已很不耐煩，眞的把鐵栅門拉上，鎖了。</p>
<p>伊立在鐵栅門外，瑟縮地戰顫着，還痴痴地遥望着迢遥而模糊的東面馬路上，可有什麽人影或者是車子過來。</p>

<p>▲南市昨日　路來源因天雨所阻祇到蘇同帮一號、平湖帮二號、青角一號、但浦江中存積船戶豐記碼頭及董家渡一帶共約四十號左右、計厚粳早晚稻及秈米等貨約三千二百擔、河下船貨因天雨不止、均未開斛、</p>
<p>▲新閘昨因風雨不息、河下無船抵埠、買客源豐長順二家向同興公定　洋尖一百包、限二天交貨、河貨因雨未開、</p>
<h3 id="c189">台州米上漲二三角 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>洋米各漲數分</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、因天雨甚旺人心望好、期現各米均上漲數分、客帮仍無胃口、本街因白米與客秈均漲、乃與囤戶等紛紛購買、計售開現洋米敏黨八百包、價十三元六角至十三元五角半、茄辣地二百包、價十三元五角半、期貨有小絞路貨二百噸、價六兩半、又九月份三百噸、價六兩五錢半、客秈台州白米有本街之貪辦、雖日有到貨、然夫路甚活、昨日又因天雨之故、跳漲二三角矣、客元則有北帮問津、開出江西機元二百四十包、價十五元一角、十四元九角、價亦比前開較好角外云、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、以洋麥報價役好二角左右、又因秋霖破盛、人心未免向昻、各月份開價、較前日略好近分、迨至下午開盤、市氣忽變、因天已轉晴、并洋麥之來華、决可成爲事實、某大廠家因洋麥之籌碼甚多、故無論近遠、均紛紛暢賣、數逹六七十萬、勢如山崩渠倒、致一般浮多、均呆若木雞、不能撑持、觀後步局面、如實銷不暢、恐變化正多也、結果本月份較前日跌一分七厘半、十月份跌二分二厘半、十一月份跌二分半、十二月份至二月份各跌二分二厘半云、</p>

<p>昨日麥市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、因洋麥報價略好及天雨關係、人心向昻、各月份較前日均回跌三四分不等、迨至下午開盤、跌勢之狂、又出業外人意料之外、因某大廠聞又有巨批洋麥成交、及美國之賑麥、始終必成事實、故賣氣之盛、一時無兩、觀此種景象、實因實在之籌碼太多、内地帮之多頭、又係心思、所以此種壓迫終不能維持也、結果本月份較前日反跌五分、十月份跌四分、十一月份跌四分、十二月份跌五分、一月份跌六分、二月份跌四分云、</p>

<p>湘蓮近以水患關係、地價逐步上漲、據現在地頭函訉每砠須三十兩、此開行盤因亦隨升、且存底亦屬無多、粤甬去胃均尙可觀、趨勢堅定、昨市湘潭運售五十二兩、衡州饒州蓮均五十兩、常德蓮四十九兩、白蓮初市不上四十兩、近亦步升、昨市售四十四兩、</p>

<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無轉機、查八繭灰經美銷依然疲滯、去電不轉、一般囤戶則抑繭囤積市氣不振、昨由信孚等進上身灰經四十包、價跌十兩、緯成淮滬廠經十包價仍不漲云、</p>

<p>我國拒用日貨··存繭分批裝出</p>
<p>日本今歲春夏二繭、收成尙豐、鑒於我國繭產奇歉、加以日繭進口准予减征進口稅、故日商源源運滬、乘機兜售、嗣因我國各廠商一致拒購日繭、致存儲日郵洋棧之大批日繭、祇得零籌銷路、是以連日法郵出口、均有日繭轉運他國、屈指半月餘、日繭裝出共逹三四千包、其中十之八運往法屬馬賽等埠、</p>

<p>昨日來路莊之貢熙緑茶、市面轉呈發展之勢、蓋銷茶廣大之俄國恊助會、鑒於英印各莊行家及華茶商搜買不遺餘力存底日趨枯薄、非放價無茶買進業已電知莫斯科總行請示、行情因之激漲二三兩、其餘珍眉針眉等貨、因茶數稀少、歐銷暢逹、華茶商態度堅硬、市盤亦均有涨無跌云、</p>

<p>▲市塲情形昨日秋雨連綿、五金交易益覺冷落、客戶因裝船不便、多存觀望態度、廠家因逢週六、故採辦不多、是以市場形勢重現鬆疲氣象、雖一般五金商竭欲盼望前途之轉機、四出兜攬、總以受環境不良之壓迫、恐一時殊無步入佳境之可能耳、</p>
<p>▲鋼品鋼品中交易推竹節鋼爲最暢逹、惟邇因存濃出微、市甚萎軟、行情則祇估九十二三兩、而受主尙嫌其價大、所以交易異常冷落、鋼板雖趨况較好、惟花色除半分七厘半稍見活潑外、其餘亦呆木不活價半分六兩六錢、七厘半六兩四錢、昨日開出六七百擔、其餘鋼絲洋元等均呈岑寂之勢、</p>
<p>▲鐵類平白鐵瓦楞鐵新近交易雖無進步但比之前市尙無良莠之分、價因來本較廉、故亦隨之帶小、法西釘交易尙旺、惟價不振、刻估八兩七錢半、比前跌一錢半、黑鐵皮爲目下之時令品、出路已稍稍見動、價十一兩、昨成交三四百扎、由天津帮辦進、盤元·角鐵·馬口鐵等、近則推銷不易、市面有慘落之象、美方釘·元邊釘·及舊鐵品等、市况如恒、價亦平穩、</p>
<p>▲銅貨自長江上游水患發生以來、此貨出路大見冷落、本街廠家點綴亦微、故交易無甚可誌、</p>
<p>▲青鉛洋鉛昨估十五兩七錢半、土鉛十五兩五錢、交易除天津烟台寗紹等帮外、别帮則均無指染、</p>
<p>▲點錫市面近亦不振、雖紹興帮尙有買賣、但别路生意依無問津價海外來電倐昻倐廉、致本埠售價亦無確實標準、所幸存底不多、人心均無恐怖狀態、故價除少許上落外、殊無鉅大變遷</p>

China has undertaken the transportation and has agreed to grant the United States the same opportunities as other countries' ships. Mr. Villiam of the Agricultural Bureau commented on this matter, saying that the second step will now be the responsibility of the American shipping companies, because currently, American ships charge more per ton for goods transported to China than ships from other countries, charging from 50 cents to one dollar more.

<h3 id="e33">The Current Great Responsibility of the Chinese Economic Society (4) <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(V) In the previous article, we mentioned that China's social economy is indeed like a big mystery. The external manifestations of this mystery are the extreme complexity of technological level and economic form. The latest equipment in technology exists simultaneously with the production tools of the prehistoric era. There are shipyards manufacturing steamships, factories manufacturing electric bubbles, and also millions of handicraft production tools such as wooden looms. There are airplanes, cars, steamships, and also horse-drawn carriages, rickshaws, and even extremely crude single-wheeled carts. There are wooden plows and clumsy waterwheels, and also the latest deep plowing machines and electric irrigation. Complex production technologies reflect the various remaining production relations and socio-economic levels within society. However, no matter how complex and chaotic it is, we can determine that the leadership of China's economy is firmly in the hands of capitalist economics by observing the phenomenon that all countries in the world are linked together as a whole economic unit and the development of capitalism in China.</p>
<p>However, to say that China's economy is no different from the economies of capitalist countries in the world is not correct. We have already grasped the historicity and regularity of China's social development from general laws, and we should especially grasp the deformed, abnormal, and unbalanced nature of its development from the recognition of special conditions. In other words, the special characteristics of China's economy are that although capitalist economics has led China's economy onto the road of capitalism, the relationship between the suzerain state and the colony has also been established simultaneously. That is, advanced countries promote the components and future of capitalist economics in the whole aspect, while on the other hand, they shackle China's economy, preventing it from developing on the road of national capitalism. At the same time, because of the weakness of the original accumulation of Chinese national capital, most of the capitalist production technology in the country relies on foreign supply, so national industries cannot develop, especially heavy industries cannot keep pace with advanced countries and show a clear lag. Raw materials are plundered by advanced countries, markets are occupied by advanced countries, the economy is controlled by advanced countries, and industry is controlled by advanced countries. In terms of economy, it becomes unautonomous. Therefore, although Chinese capitalist economics has some points that are very similar in quantity and quality, China's economy has its own special characteristics. Secondly, China cannot be economically independent, and those who control China's economy are not just one advanced capitalist country. Each advanced capitalist country in China has its own special rights. This is different from India, which is solely ruled by Britain, and Korea, which is solely ruled by Japan. Therefore, China has become a semi-colonial capitalist economy. Furthermore, although the foundation of China's feudal economy has collapsed, its remaining forces still have some existence and often play a negative role in resisting and hindering the pace of capitalist development in China. Therefore, the development of China's capitalist economy is becoming more and more sluggish. As mentioned above, China's capitalist economy cannot move forward with big steps due to the obstruction of the remaining feudal forces, and cannot enter the future of national capitalist economics due to the shackles of international capitalism. We should grasp the special characteristics of China's economy from these two points.</p>
<p>(VI) What is the future of China's economy? That is, where will China go? This question is the most urgent question for China today. We believe that if we follow the status quo, not to mention the present, China will inevitably fall into a more miserable fate because of the Second World War. Following the path of capitalism is blindly moving forward. Modern capitalist economics has already shown signs of decline, and following its old track is enough to lead to the trap of mutual decline. Other than that, in terms of factual obstacles and environmental reefs, it is absolutely impossible to rely on the socialist economic system of the Soviet Union. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once illuminated us with a bright road: internally, use the land revolution to eradicate feudal remnants so that China's economy can develop with big strides; externally, use the national revolution to break the shackles of international capitalism so that China's economy can be autonomous and independent. Its trend is the non-capitalist, that is, the socialist people's livelihood economic future.</p>
<p>Our opinions on the answers to the above six questions are like this. However, this kind of fundamental question related to the future of the country and the nation should naturally be studied in detail by experts by combining the real facts and contributing what they have learned to the authorities so that our country can determine its future, determine its economic policy to deal with the status quo and break the status quo. This great responsibility really belongs to the gentlemen of the Economic Society. We sincerely hope that the gentlemen of the Economic Society will make earnest efforts in this direction in the future, standing in the face of the above fundamental issues with a calm spirit, not avoiding, not stepping into the air, and striving to shoulder this great mission.</p>

<p>Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from its Minister to Mexico, Xiong Chongzhi, stating that regarding the anti-Chinese matter, the Mexican Foreign Minister has again issued orders to the governors of both the Shunyu and Liang provinces to earnestly protect Chinese residents. A reply indicating compliance has been received. The Shun Nala Consul telegraphed that the provincial governor's policy towards the Chinese is not to expel them but to halt anti-Chinese actions, limiting them to two months to liquidate their assets and leave the country. The expulsion situation appears to have temporarily eased. Efforts should be made to protest and negotiate with the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the two-month departure limit. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department in Washington announced today that China has formally requested the U.S. government to intervene in the expulsion of Chinese residents in the states of Sonora and others in Mexico. However, as Acting Secretary of State Castle has gone to a spa for rest and Monday is Labor Day, he will return to Beijing on Tuesday. Therefore, the U.S. government's stance will not be officially announced for several days. It is currently reported that the Mexican government has agreed with the two state governors to delay forcing Chinese residents to leave the country, and the situation has eased. The Chinese Minister to Mexico is continuing negotiations with the Mexican government. Prior to receiving the official request for intervention from the Chinese government, individuals in the State Department expressed that they would be willing to provide assistance to the Chinese residents in Mexico to the best of their ability. (4th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>The formal application by the Chinese Embassy in the United States to the U.S. State Department for mediation in the Sino-Mexican dispute over the expulsion of Chinese residents has caused a serious reaction in Mexico City. According to the United Press Association, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a statement stating that the interference of the Chinese Embassy in Washington is unreasonable and reckless and cannot be accepted by the Mexican government. The Mexican authorities are now acting according to the situation, and the Chinese Embassy in Mexico has agreed to fully cooperate to remove the difficulties faced by its nationals. According to a message from the American United Press Association, informed sources in Mexico City have revealed that Mexico is about to join the League of Nations. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hammo Schell, Governor of Sonora, stated today that he has obtained approval from the Federal Government that the military can be used to protect Chinese residents during the activities of the Anti-Chinese Committee. It is hoped that this will prevent the forced departure of Chinese residents in the territory. He also stated that this plan has been notified to Chinese Minister Xiong. According to reports, at least one thousand Chinese residents in Sonora have been forced to leave the country. (4th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Mexico City today Mexican Foreign Minister Estrada and Chinese Minister Xiong Chongzhi began formal negotiations on the expulsion of Chinese residents from Sonora and Sierra provinces. The Mexican Foreign Minister also told the American United Press Agency that this case can be directly negotiated between China and Mexico, and there is no need for third-party intervention. This statement was made in reference to China's request for U.S. intervention. He also said that 80% of the Chinese businesses in Mexico have been forced to close, and it is difficult to say whether they will be able to resume operations in the future. The results of Minister Xiong's negotiations with the Mexican Foreign Minister will be announced early next week. Minister Xiong expressed some relief today that the governor of Sonora has agreed to use the military to protect the remaining Chinese residents. It is now reported that Chinese residents in the state have stopped going to the United States as a result. (4th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>The western route of the Sino-French Academic Expedition, which departed from Beirut in April, arrived in the western border of Xinjiang at the end of August. The eastern route departed from Zhangjiakou in the spring. The two routes were scheduled to meet in Hami in July. However, the western route was delayed due to wind, rain, and other difficulties. The eastern route was also delayed due to disputes, leading to the angry return of leaders such as Chu Minyi to Beijing a few days ago. Several French and Chinese members of the eastern route are still waiting in Hami. The two routes may soon meet. Since its departure, the western route has passed through places such as Tehran and Pamir. The team has eight climbing vehicles, and a representative from the National Geographic Society of America. Progress has been slower than expected due to heavy rain, and there are several places where the mountains are high and the paths are narrow, requiring the climbing vehicles to be dismantled, carried up the mountain, and then reassembled.

Regarding the incident of Bu An insulting Hao Jingsheng, he stated that he immediately declared the cessation of cooperation and falsely signed seven articles of continued cooperation.

He only learned of the widespread uproar upon arriving in Beijing yesterday, having heard nothing of it at the time. Hao was beaten, and Bu An took action. Only when both parties were present could the matter be discussed. How could it be investigated from thousands of miles away? This cooperation with the French was a failure, but the trial use of climbing vehicles for the development of Xinjiang was a success. I hope that the three major trunk roads in the Northwest will be completed in the shortest possible time; otherwise, Mongolia and Xinjiang will inevitably fall into foreign territory. The three trunk roads are: one from Sui via Mongolia to Chengzi, two from Ping via the Eighteen Stations to Xi'an, Lanzhou, Hami, and Dihua, and three from the former Yangguan Avenue, south to Xinjiang, Hotan, Yutian, and then to Haas.

<p>The Hague Court Ruling</p>
<p>Only Survives as a Paper Formality</p>
<p>Dr. Wang Chonghui Did Not Sign</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, The Hague, 4th Dr. The Hague Court today opened and announced the judgment of the German-Austrian Customs Union case, which was simultaneously released in Geneva and the capitals of European countries. It stated that the alliance plan does not conflict with Versailles and Saint-Germain, but it does not meet the Geneva Conference Record signed on October 4, 1922. The meeting record stipulates that Austrian tax revenue should be mortgaged to various countries to borrow money, and if the alliance plan is realized, it will endanger Austrian independence.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, The Hague, 5th The eight judges who opposed the German-Austrian Customs Union belonged to the eight countries of France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Colombia, Romania, Cuba, and Denmark, saying that according to the Geneva Agreement, this alliance is actually inconsistent. Seven or eight of them even pointed out that it violated the Treaty of Saint-Germain. The seven countries of China, Britain, the United States, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, and Belgium did not oppose this. They said that the League of Nations asked the court to interpret the provisions of the alliance from a legal point of view, so it should not involve politics or its consequences.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Franco-German Relations Worsen Again <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The United States Pays Germany</p>
<p>France Strongly Opposes</p>
<p>▲ National News, Berlin, 4th The relationship between Germany and France is now showing a tendency to be hindered, because France does not approve of the United States paying German merchants. This payment is the price of selling the property of the German state and people during the European War. After deducting the compensation that should be paid to the American people for their losses in the European War, the remaining amount should be remitted back to Germany. The second payment is about 9 million gold yuan. France insists that during the Hoover Plan year, Germany should not receive money from other countries if it does not pay money to other countries. However, the German people said that although it is now in the Hoover Plan period, Germany still has to pay money to Belgium, because the Germans issued a lot of marks when they occupied Belgium. Later, the mark fell, and Germany had to pay the Belgian government a certain amount of money every year in accordance with the mark agreement. In addition, the unconditional annuity in Germany's repayment is still being paid in theory. According to German newspapers, the reason why the United States is willing to pay this money is to relieve Germany's financial distress. The U.S. Undersecretary of the Treasury is now urging the French government to change its attitude, and the U.S. Ambassador to France has also requested the French government not to oppose this too much. If these two measures can be understood by the French government, the relationship between Germany and France can be restored. However, according to general estimates, the French government may insist on its uncompromising attitude. Therefore, German newspapers are now demanding that the government cancel future German-French talks as a result, saying that since the French are doing everything possible to oppress Germany, the Germans have no need to negotiate with them. This kind of argument is now widespread in German newspapers of all parties.</p>

<p>Following the Policies of the Previous Cabinet</p>
<p>Where is International Justice?</p>
<p>The Japanese Attach Importance to the Nakamura Incident</p>
<p>The Korean Massacre is Treated as If Nothing Happened</p>
<p>▲ Den Tsushin, Fuzhou, 4th The Rikken Minseito Hokuriku General Assembly was held today. Prime Minister Wakatsuki said in his speech that modern diplomacy is based on international justice and aims at coexistence and co-prosperity. The current cabinet's diplomatic policy will also be consistent with this spirit from beginning to end. It not only protects the existence of our country, but also wants to contribute to the welfare of all mankind. Diplomacy with China does not go beyond this spirit. We will fully respect the emerging consciousness of the Republic of China, but it does not run counter to adhering to the interests of Manchuria and Mongolia. There is no need to abandon this right in the concept of international justice. Therefore, the interests of Manchuria and Mongolia must be safeguarded at all costs. If they are despised, we will deal with them with a resolute attitude.</p>
<p>▲ Den Tsushin, Tokyo, 5th The Honorable House attaches great importance to the Captain Nakamura incident. The Gongzheng Society will unite the factions affiliated with the Showa Club to establish a joint political affairs research committee to discuss countermeasures. It has also been decided to meet with the factions at the Showa Club on the morning of the 6th and invite Army Military Affairs Bureau Chief Iso Kozo to attend to explain the situation in Manchuria.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 5th Army Minister Ugaki is currently in Osaka. Today, he invited 70 major merchants to hold a meeting to exchange views on the overall situation in Manchuria and Mongolia. Press representatives asked General Ugaki about this matter. According to the answer, the military authorities do not want to interfere in diplomacy, and Foreign Minister Shidehara will be able to handle this case satisfactorily.</p>
<h3 id="e60">International Disarmament Conference <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Preparations Are Still Underway</p>
<p>Unaffected by the British Political Situation</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 4th The Disarmament Conference is scheduled to be held in Geneva in February next year. There are rumors that the Disarmament Conference will be postponed due to the British financial crisis and the cluster of state affairs. Those in charge are now denying this, because London is rapidly proceeding with the preparations for the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>▲ National News, Geneva, 4th The League of Nations Council met today to discuss the issue of Iraq's declaration of independence. The French and Italian representatives strongly advocated that the termination of the trusteeship must be in accordance with certain regulations, and must first be approved by the trustee country and the League of Nations before it can be announced. The Irish representative supported this proposal. The German representative Kurtis and the British representative Cecil all advocated that it should not be restricted by various harsh regulations, making liberation too difficult. It was then resolved to transfer the entire case to the Trusteeship Committee for review, to prepare a report, and submit it to the Council meeting in January next year for consideration. Then, the issue of financial assistance to Austria requested by the League of Nations financial experts was discussed. At that time, Austrian Foreign Minister Schober gave a brief speech, stating that Austria's finances were on the verge of crisis and could not escape difficulties without the help of the masses. Therefore, the issue was transferred to the Finance Committee for consideration tomorrow.</p>

<p>The New Cabinet is Busy Handling Domestic and Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>The National Assembly is Bound to Win an Unexpected Victory</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 4th The British Cabinet is scheduled to meet on Monday afternoon next week, when the details of the proposals will be finalized, so that they can be submitted to the National Assembly the next day. Prime Minister MacDonald has gone to his villa to take time to deal with the accumulated official affairs of the past week. All the methods and proposals that the government intends to submit to the National Assembly have been reported in detail to the British Emperor. It is not known what steps the opposition party under the leadership of Henderson intends to take. However, it is felt that some Labor Party members have undecided opinions. Tuesday is the day when the National Assembly reopens, and it is also the day when the General Confederation of Labor gathers in Bristol. Therefore, it is expected that many Labor Party members will attend the General Confederation of Labor meeting on that day instead of going to the Lower House, so as not to be caught in a dilemma. If so, the new government will get more votes of approval. The government's tax plan is now kept secret, but tobacco merchants all over the United Kingdom have received official notices restricting the shipment of goods from warehouses. This can be regarded as a tax increase on tobacco. It is expected that tea will also be taxed. Tea merchants are now withdrawing a large number of goods from warehouses to avoid paying new taxes in the future. Although the government is busy with domestic issues, it does not neglect foreign affairs. Foreign Minister Leeds is not only responsible for foreign affairs, but also the Liberal Party representative to the upcoming Indian Round Table Conference. His duties are heavy, but he still plans to take some time to go to Geneva to participate in the League of Nations Parliamentary Conference.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 4th Colonial Minister Thomas said in a speech in the B B Electoral District today that the government's financial policy will be announced in the Lower House in a few days. When the people see it, they will not only understand the government's intention to allocate burdens fairly, but also see the government's proposed measures to reduce taxes, which the majority of the previous cabinet also considered necessary. The crisis can only be saved if the world is firmly convinced that Britain has the ability and intention to fully meet its debts. Therefore, the government must adopt a policy to eliminate any doubts in the world about the stability of British finances. People may blame the abolition of the dole for destroying one-tenth of it, but he can answer that the policy he has adhered to can save the unemployed, not only the reduction of one-tenth, but also the reduction of one-fifth. He has never sacrificed his principles, but followed the dictates of his conscience. This can be told to the railway workers in the electoral district. He hopes that his decades-long relationship with the railway workers will only be temporarily interrupted. Thomas has been the representative of the B Electoral District in the Lower House for 20 years.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 5th It is reported that the Labor Party's participation in the Indian Round Table Conference has not yet been finally decided. However, a temporary plan has been set for Henderson, Been, and Smith to attend the preparatory meeting of the Federal Structural System Committee at 3:00 PM on September 7.</p>

<p>Police and Strikers in Street Fights</p>
<p>Gunfire Never Ceases All Day Long</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Barcelona (Spain), 5th A general strike has resumed here.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Barcelona, 4th Although this place is not yet peaceful, the price of the conflict between the police and the communists can now be determined. A total of 20 people were killed and 40 were injured. Several people were detained. The strike that caused the unrest has been formally declared to have ended. Today, the sound of machine guns and rifles never ceased all day long. Although martial law has not been declared, sailors have landed to protect civilians. When the police surrounded the general office of the union, the strikers defended themselves stubbornly, using their rifles and unlimited ammunition to confront the police for six hours. The authorities threatened to call in artillery to bombard, and the strikers surrendered. However, after leaving the building, someone suddenly shot at the police, and the police returned fire, killing three people and seriously injuring five. Forty prisoners escaped during the chaos. Women participated in the street fighting. Hundreds of women attacked the church, climbed to the top, held guns and shot down, killing two policemen. The striking women are still holding on to the trenches dug on the main road. Tonight, important members of the union sent representatives with white flags to see the civil administrator, claiming that they were prepared to disarm, but did not want to surrender to the militia, fearing that they would be massacred. The civil administrator then sent troops to escort about 100 surrenders to the harbor and temporarily detained them on board. Soldiers seized a lot of military equipment in the base area of the rebels, enough for a thousand people to use. With the headquarters of the strikers broken, it is hoped that the unrest will be calmed down soon.</p>

Therefore, it has issued an arrest warrant for Alfonso on charges of treason, and it is reported that the new government will instruct the ambassadors to Britain and France to notify their respective governments that allowing the deposed king to reside is sheltering a traitor. However, the new government has no formal intention to request extradition from foreign countries. In addition, General Anido, the Minister of the Interior during the Rivera era, is now hiding in France. It is reported that the Western government will request the French government to extradite him on charges of treason and greed.</p>

<p>Telegram from Henan, addressed to all newspaper offices: The severity of the floods in various provinces this time is unprecedented. The cries of the suffering are everywhere, and the scenes are heartbreaking. People from all walks of life in Henan Province, with a spirit of helping others in their plight, are taking collective action. On September 3rd, representatives from the party, military, government, legal, and police agencies, as well as legal entities and gentry, gathered for a joint meeting to discuss solutions. It was decided to organize the Henan Provincial Flood Relief Association, which was established on the same day. Yu Guohuan, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, was elected as the chairman, and leaders from various agencies and legal entities were elected as members. Four groups were established: General Affairs, Administration, Finance, and Relief, each with a chief secretary and several secretaries in charge of their respective tasks.

Fundraising will then be widely promoted and remitted successively, in the hope that collective efforts will make it easier to alleviate the disaster and that all affected compatriots will reach the other shore together. We respectfully report this by telegram, and humbly request your consideration. Henan Provincial Flood Relief Association respectfully.</p>
<p>Begging Telegram from Huaining County, Anhui, addressed to all philanthropists, agencies, and organizations: Shi Pai borders the Wan River and is located in a low-lying area where the waters of Qian and Tai converge. The floods in previous years have been particularly severe compared to other places. Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been continuous heavy rain and flash floods. Fortunately, the situation gradually subsided after ten days. However, the river tide followed, flowing backward and causing the embankment to collapse and disappear completely. The hundred-mile fields have become a swamp. The public dams of the Eight Baos of Huaining and the Five Temples of Wangjiang, which had fortunately been preserved during the flash floods, were inundated by the river tide. The severity and extent of the disaster are unprecedented in a century. The current water level continues to rise, and there is no hope for replanting as autumn turns to winter. The people have no means of livelihood, no food, and no clothing. How can they continue to survive? All the tragic circumstances were personally inspected by Commissioner Hong of the Central Relief Committee, who witnessed them firsthand and should be able to show great compassion. We are afraid that the disaster area is too large, and a drop in the bucket will not help. We mourn for these people, whose lives are hanging by a thread. We have always admired your compassion and empathy, and we hope that you will call for help and provide assistance. More money will save more lives, and earlier help will save more days. On behalf of the disaster victims, we extend our necks and raise our heels to look forward to your kindness. We are anxiously awaiting your response. The Huaining County Yaonian Township Flood Relief Branch Committee, Chen Wolu, Jiang Leifeng, Sheng Zhaorui, Chen Shaotang, Liu Runsheng, etc., jointly kowtow, winter seal.</p>

<h3 id="e68">The Supervisory Yuan and the Jiangsu Party Department Send Personnel to Yangzhou to Investigate the Breaches <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Disaster Situation in Dongtai and Xinghua is the Most Tragic</p>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: The National Government Supervisory Yuan and the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department attach great importance to the floods in Jiangbei and are eager to investigate the cause of the breaches, whether local authorities are responsible, and whether officials in charge of water conservancy have been negligent. This is to propose impeachment and console the dead and the disaster victims awaiting rescue. In addition to sending personnel to various disaster areas for investigation, the Supervisory Yuan has now appointed Commissioners Gao Yihan and Advisor Hong Lanyou, and the Provincial Party Department has appointed Commissioners Ma Yinbing and Zhang Yuanyang, and Officer Chen Zhongmin, to go to the disaster areas for further thorough investigation as a basis for requesting punishment and to represent the central government in consoling the disaster victims. The commissioners arrived in Yangzhou yesterday (the 4th) at 5:00 PM on the Yongfa special boat from Zhenjiang and immediately disembarked to the Jiangdu County Party Department. They were received by Commissioners Wu Zunyi and Hu Panrong, who accompanied them to the county Chamber of Commerce Flood Relief Association to inquire about the disaster situation. Subsequently, Ruan Lianzhong, Director of the Emergency Relief Association Shelter, led them to the Changsheng Temple Refugee Shelter outside the breach city to console the refugees and learn about the disaster situation. Commissioners Ma and Zhang returned to the County Party Department at 8:00 PM to convene a meeting with all the staff, encouraging all party members to work hard on disaster relief without slackening. After the meeting, they returned to the original boat. It is reported that the commissioners are scheduled to go to the disaster areas tomorrow morning and are expected to complete the investigation in a week. They are accompanied by a photographer from Yingyuexuan Photo Studio to take footage of the disaster areas, so that the central government can fully understand the true situation of the affected areas. He Haiqiao, Section Chief of the Second Section of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, also arrived in Yangzhou at 2:00 PM yesterday and will bring relief grain to the disaster areas for distribution this morning.</p>
<p>According to reports, the first to bear the brunt of the breach in the Grand Canal were Shaobo City in Jiangdu and Gaoyou County. However, although the disaster situation in these two places is severe, rescue and burial have already taken place after the water receded, which can be considered to have reached a certain standard. The most unsettled areas are the five counties downstream: Yancheng, Funing, Taixian, Xinghua, and Dongtai. The water that passed through Gao and Shao has all concentrated in the low-lying areas of the above counties in recent days. It is reported that the worst affected counties are Dongtai and Xinghua, as the county seats of both counties have been submerged in water. Yesterday,</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>A telegram from Dongtai relayed from Rugao stated that the Yun Dike had breached, the county seat was submerged, and people had been drowned. As for Xinghua's postal and telegraph communications, they have been cut off for three days. It is said that the city is also completely submerged. The other three counties, Yancheng, Funing, and Taixian, send telegrams of disaster reports and requests for relief every day. However, those handling relief efforts are concerned that the disaster area is vast, and there is a danger of neglecting one area while attending to another.</p>
<p>After this major disaster occurred, robberies have occurred frequently in the affected areas. There have been many instances of people openly wading through the water to loot property. Zhang, the brigade commander of the 94th Brigade stationed in Yangzhou at the time, received a personal instruction from Governor Zhang and ordered the 9th Company of the 3rd Battalion of his subordinate troops to go to Shaobo to maintain order. In addition, Zhao Yisun and other citizens of Shaobo Town estimated that there were about 3,000 disaster victims in the vicinity of the town. The emergency relief associations that have been providing relief in recent days have all been providing dry food, but the disaster victims have sore tongues and cracked lips after chewing it. Zhao and others raised funds to set up three porridge kitchens in the town to distribute porridge twice a day, which is slightly better than eating only dry food. In addition, Liang, the commander of the 25th Route Army, issued a special notice to the farmers in the disaster area yesterday, stating that if livestock have been washed away and cannot be used to replace human labor, the village chiefs can borrow mules and horses from the troops stationed in the area to help with plowing, but each village can only borrow for one or two days, so as to avoid other villages being left out. The grooms and the food for the mules and horses will be provided by each battalion and no compensation will be allowed.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Relief Situation After the Gaoshao Disaster <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Gaoyou Correspondence: The Yun Dike at the North Gate Temple Lane, Qigong Temple, and Tonghu Bridge in this county breached at around 3:00 AM on the 26th. The disaster situation has been reported in detail in previous reports. The following is a continuation of the disaster situation in recent days: On the 27th, because the North Water Gate had not yet been blocked, the water continued to pour into the city, and the water depth inside the city reached eight feet in the deepest places and about one foot in the shallow places. The general residents fled to the South Gate, carrying the old and supporting the young. The wealthy hired boats to stay temporarily, while the poor were exposed on the Yun Dike. In the evening, philanthropists in the county provided porridge on the Yun Dike, so the general refugees did not have to worry about starvation. Unexpectedly, at around 1:00 AM on the 28th, a group of police officers suddenly</p>
<p>Before the Taimei Oil Company in the South Gate demanded pay from Wang, the county magistrate. Wang, because he had no money to maintain order at the time, feared that accidents would occur and ordered the police force of the provincial public security team stationed on the post office ship to disarm. At that time, both sides fired several shots, resulting in the soldiers who were demanding pay being completely disarmed and a police officer of the provincial public security team being shot and injured. He was then taken to the Great King Temple and treated by the Fumin Hospital. When the shooting started, the general refugees thought that bandits were robbing them and were extremely alarmed. The refugees on the dike fled to the boats, and the boats moved towards the lake, causing temporary chaos. After receiving confirmation, people calmed down. By 6:00 AM, it was heard that Yi Xin Xu Tang, a local gentry, had supervised the work at the North Water Gate and had sawed off more than ten electric light poles in the city and carried them to the rescue. It had been blocked on the evening of the 27th, and the water in the city had stabilized. The refugees living in the city received the news and rushed home. However, the refugees outside the North Gate were still on the dike because most of their houses had been washed away by the water. In recent days, thieves have taken the opportunity to search for property in the disaster area of the North Gate by boat. Fortunately, the county water patrol team discovered this and shot eight people and captured more than ten people. Now the thieves have disappeared. Since the 29th, relief associations and Red Cross societies from Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Bao Ying, Huai An, and Huaiyin counties have sent people to Gaoyou to distribute relief and transport tens of thousands of refugees. However, some refugees in the city are unwilling to leave their homes and are enduring hunger and starvation. It is hoped that the relief associations will quickly enter the city to provide relief to save the disaster victims. Today (the 31st), Commander-in-Chief Liang visited Gaoyou, accompanied by County Magistrate Wang, and went to the North Gate disaster area (Lu Zhiwen, a reporter, took a photo of the embankment on the Shaobo River in a crowded boat)</p>
<p>for inspection. Many ships were prepared to transport refugees to Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Nantong, Rugao, and other places for refuge. The North Gate Temple Lane, Qigong Temple, and Tonghu Bridge in this county have three Yun Dike breaches, with the Qigong Temple being the most severe. The stone work of the Yun Dike at that location has been washed away by more than two feet. If there is a storm, that location will still be quite dangerous. County Magistrate Wang has now hired workers to first build the gap, but the water in the city is still very deep, making travel very inconvenient. Food and vegetables are transported by small boats. Several water pumps have been transported from Yangzhou and placed at the southeast gates to pump water. It is expected that the water in the city can be pumped out in ten days. (August 31st)</p>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: Since the Shao You Dike breached and the Jiang tide broke through the embankment, Yangzhou has been surrounded by floods, and there have been many requests for relief. The official and charitable organizations are rushing to provide relief, as reported in detail in previous reports. It is now known that the refugees who came to Yangzhou in the past four days include 147 refugees transported by the Taixian Public Security Bureau (sheltered at Xu Gongci), more than 290 refugees transported from Gaoyou (sheltered at Changsheng Temple), and Xianzhen is planning to transport more than 100 refugees to Yangzhou for shelter in the evening. The Jiangsu Righteous Relief Association has sent Quan Liangji and others to Changsheng Temple to gather refugees in the main hall of the temple for a group photo. The Jiangdu Flood Relief Association sends personnel to transport 400 dan of relief grain to various disaster areas for distribution every day. In addition, Wang Fenglou and Zhang Bin, representatives from the riverside Xiangqi Shumu Temple, reported to the association that the area is remote and it is difficult to deliver relief grain to the refugees squatting on the embankment. They requested dry food, and the association allocated relief supplies to the representatives to take back for distribution. At the same time, representatives from the Shatian Huangjia Village area north of Shaobo and south of Lujin also came to Yangzhou to request relief. The Shanghai Ningbo Fellow Association brought a large quantity of relief supplies and silver to Yangzhou on the 4th and stayed at the Baohua Hotel, departing daily to distribute them in various disaster areas. Many important figures from charitable organizations from other places have come to Yangzhou to provide relief. A special letter was sent to the county court to borrow the Hua Long houses that had been sealed up as a reception center, which was approved. Guo Lanshi and Yang Shengwu were sent to arrange it on the 4th. County Magistrate Chen Nanxuan, because Chairman Jiang will come to Jiangbei to inspect the disaster in the next few days, in addition to notifying the shops to hang flags and preparing a welcome, also took a boat with An Zheng, Director of the Public Security Bureau, to Shao on the morning of the 4th to investigate, preparing for Chairman Jiang's consultation when he arrives in Yangzhou. As for the engineering projects of the Jiangdu Engineering Office in the past two or three days in Shao, in addition to damming twelve breaches, they also dammed two breaches at Majia Bridge and one breach at Black Fish Pond, and protected a dangerous section of the bamboo forest temple. At the same time, soldiers cleared the engineering work at the Shaobo pier. The Shaobo Town Flood Relief Association, because there are too many people, considered it inappropriate. In the afternoon of the 3rd, a meeting was held in the Chamber of Commerce to reorganize it into a relief association, electing Zhao Yisun and others as directors, and setting up an office in Yangzhou, sending Xu Zimei and others to be stationed there. As for the plan to bury the cleaned corpses, the emergency relief association has allocated 200 yuan, along with 100 coffins donated by Guo Meng and two gentlemen, and handed them over to the Red Swastika Society to send out burial teams.

<h3 id="e70">Actual Situation of the Flood in Yiling Town, Jiangdu <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: Yiling Town, Jiangdu, is located along the Grand Canal and is relatively high. In the third year of Tongzhi (Qing Dynasty), the Clear Water Pool breached, and the entire lower river area became a swamp. Yiling suffered the least damage. In the summer and autumn of the tenth year of the Republic of China, the flood situation in the upper and lower reaches of the Grand Canal was extremely serious, and Yiling barely escaped the disaster. In June and July this year, it rained heavily for more than ten days. The water in the Grand Canal rose several feet, and in the low-lying areas of the neighboring area, the river water overflowed, and traffic gradually became impassable. At that time, only a small number of paddy fields in the south of Yiling were flooded, and the residents privately rejoiced, thinking that this flood could be avoided again. However, on August 25, there was a storm for a day and night, and the water in the Grand Canal rose sharply by four or five feet. The west and east of the town became a vast ocean, and it suddenly became a swamp. In addition, the Shaobo River embankment collapsed that night, and the water rushed directly into Yiling. Residents in the northwest countryside were drowned in their sleep and did not have time to escape, and the number was countless. The cries shook the sky, and the sound could be heard for more than ten miles. The Yiling market suddenly presented a scene of panic. Xue Guangzu, the Standing Committee Member of the Fourth District Party Department, and Tang Shouwu, the Standing Committee Member of the Yiling Chamber of Commerce, temporarily convened the town chiefs Guan Leshan and Zhao Yizhi in the town, raised emergency funds, prepared more than 30 dan of dry food, and hired several civilian boats to personally carry them to the northwest and two countryside, and distributed them successively. First, they went to Henggou Bridge, and the boat traveled through the fields. After passing through Xiao Jiatou, Zhang Jiba, Mi Jiatou, Da Yinzhuang, Yangjiawei, Xiajia Bridge, and other places, the waves were raging all the way, and the houses were almost completely collapsed. Most of the disaster victims took the tops of trees and graves as shelters, and they were exposed to the wind and food, and they were in a state of feeding, which was unbearable to see. When Mr. Tang shook his boat and traveled through the northern countryside of Hanggao Bridge, Wu Jiatou, Wang Jiazhuang, and Zhu Jiatou, the birds disappeared, and the bodies flowed in the water, which was unbearable to look at. Occasionally, on the top of a high grave, there were one or two old and weak people who were dying and lying in the weeds, and their voices were only audible. It was three or five days without food. In addition to supervising the staff to go to the disaster areas to distribute dry food, Mr. Tang and others also invited the sixth district chief Hu Min, the public security bureau chief Gao Jichun, and local enthusiastic people to set up a temporary shelter for disaster victims in the Ciyun Temple in the town, and to widely receive disaster victims from afar, and to prepare porridge for two meals a day. However, the disaster area is vast, the disaster victims are numerous, and Yiling has limited financial resources. Now, in addition to the sixth district chief rushing to the relief distribution association to beg for relief, Xue Guangzu, the standing committee member of the district party department, and Tang Shouwu, the standing committee member of the chamber of commerce, have sent telegrams to the Shanghai Jiangsu Flood Relief Association to request relief.</p>

<p>Since the three dams of the Jiangbei Yun Dike were opened, the water in the counties in the inner canal has been very large. On August 18, the Construction Department proposed a proposal at the 426th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee to open all the sea entrances of the salt reclamation companies, which was decided by the meeting. The Civil Affairs and Agriculture Departments jointly handled the work and relief, and dredged Wanggang. The required funds were allocated from the new mu donation. The Yuhua Dafeng Company's sea entrances were opened and Dongtai County was ordered to do so. Later, according to a telegram from Dongtai County Magistrate Huang, the Dafeng Yuhua's three sea dams had opened two places in the south and middle, and the tenant farmers of the North Maoyou River were protecting it with force. The farmers of Xingsalt gathered more than 10,000 people, fearing that incidents would occur. On the 24th, the provincial government telegraphed the two county magistrates of Dongtai and Xingdai to await instructions and strictly suppress them. On the 28th, it was again proposed at the 429th meeting of the Provincial Government, and it was decided to order the county to instruct the two companies of Da and Yu to quickly dredge the 800-zhang eastern end of the Central Maoyou to connect Wangjia Port and drain the water into the sea. On the 30th, a telegram was received from the Dongtai County Magistrate, stating that the company was gathering tenants to obstruct the opening of the earth dam, and requested that a squadron each from Tai Salt and Xing be sent to the county to jointly open it. The provincial government immediately telegraphed Director Zhang and telegraphed Director Li to instruct the stationed teams in each county to handle it.</p>
<p>On the 31st, Dafeng Yuhua and the two companies telegraphed the provincial government, stating that the county committee had opened the south and central Maoyou, and the tenant farmers had colluded to resist. They had reported to the county to send troops to supervise the opening. On September 1st, the provincial government sent Section Chief He to Yangzhou to contact Director Zhang and send troops to the east to assist in opening the river. On the 2nd, the Xinghua County Government and County Party Department telegraphed to request the opening of the Sanmaoyou River. On the 3rd, the provincial government telegraphed the Dongtai County Magistrate again to quickly prepare two battalions of soldiers to be stationed near the South and Central Maoyou River. From this, it can be seen that the dispute over this issue is fierce.</p>

<p>▲ The Security Office sent a team to protect the Yun Dike. Mao, the director of the Bureau, reported from the Yangzhou Closure Office that Wang Songlin, the deputy regimental commander of the 3rd Regiment sent by the Security Office, led a team to Shaobo and assisted in the closure of the work site. The work has now been implemented. ▲ Requisition of firewood and grass from various counties The Construction Department determined that a lot of firewood and grass were needed to close the Yun Dike and breaches. Previously, it had telegraphed Jiangdu and other counties to seal up and send the firewood stored in their jurisdiction to the post-Shao work site for application, but the number sent was still limited and insufficient. After instructing the committee to go to the production area to conduct a thorough investigation, it strictly telegraphed Zhenjiang, Jiangning, and other counties to seal up and send the firewood to the post-Shao work site in moderation. The required funds could be directly obtained from the Construction Department.</p>

Now, Song Ziliang, the director of the Bureau, replied that he agreed very much. The original telegram stated that the Bureau should do its best to help block the Yun Di embankment in order to save the disaster victims. Yesterday, after receiving a telegram from the interior, it immediately tried to dispatch the Haiying dredger and five engineers, and planned to send the deputy chief engineer Xue Zhuobin to investigate and assist. The machine is 42 feet long, 22 feet wide, 2 feet 6 inches draft, can dig 12 cubic feet of mixed mud per hour, and requires 400 pounds of coal.

<h3 id="e74">Zhang Fang Appeals for Henan Flood Victims <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Fang, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Relief Committee, telegraphed on the East River to: Chiang, Chairman of the Nanjing National Government; Zhang, Deputy Commander of the Shenyang Army, Navy, and Air Force; Song, Chairman of the Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Urgent Relief for Provincial Floods; Presidents of various academies and ministers of various departments in Nanjing; Xu, Chairman of the Relief Committee; various provincial governments, provincial relief committees, charitable organizations, and newspaper offices. Respectfully, the province of Henan has suffered from continuous rain, causing rivers to overflow. The flooded area has exceeded half of the province. Here are the essential details of each county's disaster situation, urgently requesting rescue and relief. It is now reported by the Fangcheng County Relief Subcommittee and various district chiefs that since the beginning of summer this year, two months of continuous rain have turned the plains into a swamp. By the end of June and the beginning of July, even more heavy rain fell continuously, day and night. The city walls collapsed for more than thirty feet, and the river water overflowed. The Pan River and Jia River to the east of the city, and the Fu River and Zhao River to the west of the city, burst and flowed horizontally, unable to be stopped. In the Heiyan Zhuang area in the east district and the Wang Tu Zhuang villages in the west district, fields were washed into ditches, and people and livestock drifted with the water. Right at that moment, it was late at night, and many people were crushed and killed by collapsed houses, or drowned immediately. It is estimated that more than 17,000 houses collapsed, and more than 630 civilians died. The Fanshui County Relief Subcommittee reported that this year's wheat harvest was poor, and autumn crops were being planted when they were initially hit by severe drought, followed by continuous rain. By July and August, heavy rain fell repeatedly, and the autumn seedlings on both banks of the Si River were completely submerged. The Yellow River's water was surging, and both new and old beach areas were covered with silt. It is estimated that more than 600 hectares of farmland in the southern mountain areas were washed into ditches, and the number of collapsed houses is even harder to count. The Pingdeng County Relief Subcommittee reported that on the 8th and 10th of August, heavy rain fell for eleven days and nights. The Yi River suddenly rose, reaching from Jiu Gao in the south to Longmen in the north, covering dozens of miles in the east and west, with no boundaries. The people were in dire straits, mulberry fields became a sea, and the exact number of losses and refugees is currently under investigation. The Yiyang County Party Department reported that in recent years, the people have suffered from soldiers, bandits, drought, and locusts. Without anticipating that the wounds were still present, floods have occurred again. Since the beginning of summer this year, prolonged rain has not stopped. In early July, torrential rain poured down, turning highlands and plains into a vast expanse of water. The sound of collapsing houses never ceased, and belongings and livestock were all swept away. An investigation of the Lian Zhuang Li Canal Sun Liu Han Cheng Liu Quan Shui Que areas north and south of the Luo River, as well as the Shui Po Tou and other villages in the county seat, covering an area of less than a hundred li, revealed that no less than several thousand houses had collapsed and several thousand acres of farmland had been washed away. The extent of other losses can be imagined. The Weishi County Relief Subcommittee reported that since June, there had been continuous rain for weeks without stopping. Low-lying fields and crops were already submerged. By early August, heavy rain poured down, flooding mountains and hills, and the autumn crops were completely submerged. The new and old Jia Lu Rivers and Shuang Ji Rivers burst their banks, and overflowed wildly. Not only were the fields and crops lost, but all the houses were washed away, and many people and livestock were crushed and killed. There is no hope for the autumn harvest. The Jiaxian County Relief Subcommittee reported that due to frequent banditry, nine out of ten houses were empty. This spring, the troops suppressed the bandits, and the residents began to feel slightly at ease. Who would have thought that since the beginning of summer, months of continuous rain had made any harvest impossible. On the evening of August 10th, torrential rain fell again, not stopping all night. Mountain floods surged, and the Ru River overflowed, flooding dozens of villages along the river. Possessions and food were all gone, and there was no place to live. The water was about four or five feet deep, and approximately hundreds of people died. Representatives of the people from the second district of Lanfeng County presented a report stating that this district is located near the Yellow River, with land level with the water. Every time there is a rise, it overflows. This year, when the ice thawed in the spring river, the water flowed horizontally and vertically, and the wheat seedlings were submerged, already causing unbearable suffering. By the end of July and the beginning of August, there was continuous heavy rain for half a month without stopping. The water was five or six feet deep on the plains, submerging autumn crops, collapsing houses, and washing away countless people and livestock. The Civil Affairs Department forwarded a report from the magistrate of Minquan County, relayed by representatives of the people from the first, second, and third districts, stating that last year's war disasters had left the area in ruins. Who knew that human disasters had just ended when natural disasters struck again. Since the beginning of summer, continuous rain has been a scourge, with water several feet deep, collapsing houses, casualties among people and livestock, and all the autumn crops submerged. The affected people have nowhere to eat or sleep. The Civil Affairs Department forwarded a report from the village chiefs of various villages in the second and fifth districts of Anyang County, stating that the district has a Guangrun Lake that is shaped like the bottom of a pot. It has always accumulated water when flooded and never dries up throughout the year. This month, in August, the Caiyuan Town in Tangyin County, which belongs to the south of the lake, experienced a flash flood in the Tang River, which was very turbulent. The waves rolled and all flowed into the lake, causing dozens of villages to turn into swamps. Currently, there has been continuous rain for a long time, submerging all the autumn crops, making it difficult to sow wheat, and causing severe spring famine. These situations have all been reported to the meeting. An investigation has revealed that there are now sixty-seven counties in Henan Province affected by the flood. The number of distressed people is estimated to be over fifteen million. Relief will bring life, while no relief will bring death. It is hoped that the central government and charitable groups everywhere will quickly provide generous assistance to save these people. The telegram cannot fully express the anticipation of waiting for orders. One.</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Yalu River Also Suffers from Major Flooding <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Counties such as Andong and Linjiang are Submerged</p>
<p>Andong Correspondence: In the middle ten days of August, the upper and lower reaches of the Yalu River experienced a rise in water, with surging waves. At the time, merchants and residents along the river were all terrified. Not long after it receded, on the 26th and 27th, it was reported that there was a second rise in water, with the water level increasing more than before. This was because from 10 p.m. on the 25th to midnight on the 26th, torrential rain poured down without stopping. At the same time, counties along the upper reaches of the river also experienced the same torrential rain, causing the river to rise significantly. From 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. on the 27th, the water level was at its highest. Low-lying areas in the city and its suburbs, as well as the Hou Chao Gou area, were a vast expanse of water, turning into swamps. Among them, the water depth in Hou Chao Gou, the east end of Zhenan Bridge, and in front of the Shahe Town train station was three or four feet due to the proximity of the Dasha River, blocking transportation. Only a dozen small boats were traveling back and forth. Also, when the river water first rose on the morning of the 26th, the county government immediately dispatched the third section to supervise various section chiefs, clerks, and staff members, dividing them into groups to patrol the river embankments day and night, taking measures to prevent flooding. On the morning of the 27th, the county government received reports of rising water from counties along the upper reaches of the river. It was reported that the water had risen twelve feet in Linjiang County, seventeen feet in Waichagou, twenty-four feet in Changdianhekou, and twenty-one feet in Mashitai. On the morning of the 27th, more than a dozen sailboats and wooden rafts docked on the riverbank were washed away by the water. There were also forty-two timber workers from a certain lumberyard who were washed away, with their fate unknown. As of 9 a.m. on the 28th, according to measurements of the river's water level by the third section of the county government, it had only slightly receded by about three feet. The flooded areas in the city and Hou Chao Gou were still a vast expanse of water. The number of merchant and resident households affected by the flooding was about 250, with a total of 2,100 people. When the water surged on the 26th and 27th, merchants and residents in the area fled in droves. However, the general poor households had nowhere to go and were sleeping on the streets, crying out for food. Their situation was pitiful. The Andong County Office, in conjunction with the Commerce Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and the General Chamber of Commerce, dispatched personnel on the afternoon of the 28th to take in refugees, temporarily using two large silk factories as temporary shelters. As of the afternoon of the 29th, a total of 725 men and women had been taken in. Following the previous method of providing relief to Korean refugees, they were provided with ample food to satisfy their hunger. The funds needed were allocated from the remaining 3,000 yuan from the previous relief effort. (August 30)</p>

<p>Reports from Various Armies of Defeating Large Groups of Red Bandits</p>
<p>Public Teachers Report Zhu De Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Recent news from the front lines indicates that there are no traces of bandits to the north of a line extending from Guangchang, Nanfeng, Le'an, and Yongfeng in the east to Jishui and Ji'an in the west. Strong fortifications have been built in Ningdu and Xingguo to the south for defense. Currently, the left wing, in addition to a portion defending the fortifications and clearing out scattered bandits and peasant bandits, is pursuing bandits who fled south towards Xingguo. Originally, after Zhu and Mao gathered in Liantang, they fled south from Gaoqingxu, Chongxian, Longping, and Yongfengxu to the area between Gan County and Wan'an. Their fake Central Military Commission's rear hospital was located in the Luxu area (bordering Gan County, Wan'an, Yudu, and Xingguo), near Lirenkeng, planning to connect with Li Mingrui, who was entrenched south of Gan County, in Chongyi and Shangyou, and flee to the border areas of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan. Zhu De was injured in Ningdu and is currently being treated in Lirenkeng. Rumors say he was bombed to death. The following is a transcription of telegrams reporting victories from various armies: (A) Telegram from the Staff Office of the 28th Division on the 30th: (1) Bi's regiment departed from Taihe and destroyed bandit nests in Yongyang and Ruyang (bordering Ji'an) within a day, killing over thirty bandits and capturing over ten alive. (2) This afternoon, over a thousand bandits were discovered across the river along the creek. Yang's brigade concentrated artillery fire across the river, while the Minkuan warship used machine guns and airplanes bombed them, killing many bandits and scattering the rest. (3) Li's battalion in Wan'an, this morning, defeated a fake independent regiment in Henglu Zhongpo, at the border of the three counties of Xingguo, Taihe, and Tai'an, killing dozens of bandits, seizing many guns, and rescuing dozens of hostages. (B) Telegram from General Commander Jiang stating, "Today, I selected over three hundred brave soldiers and disguised them with captured bandit army armbands and flags, ordering them to search the bandit area of Qingxi Xikeng in groups of three to five, while the majority continued to follow. At 11:00, they reached the bandit area. The bandits recognized them as comrades, and officials from the fake Soviet governments of Xingguo and Ruijin came to welcome them. My troops immediately surrounded and fiercely attacked them. The bandit crowd scrambled to escape, capturing the chairman of the fake Ruijin government, one committee member, and one member of the fake Xingguo committee, all of whom were executed on the spot as a warning to the public. Over ninety bandits were killed. Also captured was a fake division commander of Zhu's bandit troops, Zhu Jianxun, who was injured in the Ningdu campaign and was receiving treatment here. He has been brought back to be interrogated to obtain information about the bandit army's situation." (C) Telegram from Zhao Yong, a subordinate of Public Teacher Commander, on the 31st, stating, "There are many wounded bandits in Lirenkeng, between Taihe and Gan County. The bandit leader Zhu De is still injured and is being treated here. Zhu's guard regiment, after a long period of recruitment, now has over a thousand men serving as guards here. Yesterday, they were bombed by our airplanes, causing many casualties and deaths. They fled to Bailu and Gaoqiao overnight, abandoning approximately two thousand wounded and sick bandits."

<h3 id="e77">Wu Peifu Passes Through Chengdu to Songpan <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Will Take the Road Through Longnan Out of Sichuan</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: Wu Peifu arrived in Chengdu from Tongchuan the other day, passing through Guanghan County to Xindu County, forty li from Chengdu, on July 12th. He stayed in Baoguang Temple, a famous temple in the county, and visited Gui Lake, which is the site of the former residence of Yang Shengan, the Ming Dynasty minister. On the 16th, he took a car sent by the province to welcome him to the province. On the day of his arrival in the province, the entire city of Chengdu hung flags to welcome him. In the morning, troops from the 28th, 29th, and 24th Army headquarters were dispatched to welcome him at Sima Bridge outside the North Gate. Officials from various agencies who arrived included the two army commanders Deng and Tian. At 12:00, Wu's car arrived in the province. Military music played, and the troops presented arms. Wu got out of the car and nodded to the two army commanders and other welcomers one by one, with a smile on his face. He was wearing a Tai straw hat, a gray silk long gown, and a black gauze vest. His beard and hair were mostly white, his face was yellowish-black and slightly thin, and he was fifty-eight years old. He spoke with a Shandong accent. After sitting in the reception room for a while, he rode a large black horse prepared by Army Commander Deng into the city, accompanied by more than twenty guards, each carrying a handgun. He was led by the adjutant of the 28th Army on horseback, passing through North Main Street, Gulou Street, Tidu East Street, and Shuwa Street to the former Foreign Affairs Office residence. In the afternoon, he left the North Gate with his guards and resided in Zhaojue Temple. The hundreds of guards who came with Wu also stayed at Zhaojue Temple. Along the way, those who wanted to see Wu's demeanor crowded the streets.</p>
<p>On the fifth day after Wu arrived in the province, Song Yunzi, the president of the Guoxue Association, sent a letter inviting him to lecture on the I Ching at the auditorium of Dacheng School, summoning members to listen. At 10:00 in the morning, Wu Zhicheng first announced the opening of the meeting, followed by Guan Menglan delivering a welcome speech, and then Wu lectured on the I Ching. His words were grand, using heavenly virtue, the way of the king, and sacred achievements as the outline, discussing the sequence of the Former Heaven and Later Heaven trigrams of Fu Xi and King Wen, and concluding with saving the country through the teachings of rites. However, he spoke in Shandong dialect, which most people did not understand. Approximately a thousand people attended that day, mostly from academic circles. What was particularly noteworthy was that the bodyguards Wu brought with him wore five-colored caps and did not change the insignia. It is unknown why he insisted on this.</p>
<p>On August 2nd, Wu set off from the province to Guanxian, ostensibly to escape the summer heat at Mount Qingcheng in Guanxian. However, he was hindered by rain after arriving in Guanxian and stayed in Guanxian City for five days. On the 7th, he traveled west, passing through Songpan to leave Sichuan. On the 9th, he passed through Wenchuan. It was not until the 13th that he reached Maoxian. According to a telegram from Maoxian, Wu set off for Songpan on the 16th. Since the Song-Guan Highway has been half completed, it is estimated that it will take seven days to arrive. It is said that after Wu arrives in Songpan, he will take the road through Longnan out of Sichuan. It is said that he has already sent Liu to Gansu because the Five Ma warlords of Gansu Army sent telegrams supporting Wu last year, hence his trip to Gansu. (August 17)</p>

<p>The Case of the Patrolmen Demanding Pay Reaches a Conclusion: The patrolmen from the four districts of the city and suburbs, because the police pay for July from the First District Office was delayed and their meals were not provided, went to the District Office together to demand their pay on the 29th of last month, causing a dispute. It is now known that the outstanding money was cleared on the 3rd. It is reported that after the District Chief reported the fact that the patrolmen demanded their pay to the County Government, he received instruction No. 964, which stated that the patrol officers of the four detachments led the patrolmen of each shift to the District Office to demand their pay. The patrol officers did not understand the system and acted without authorization, which was inappropriate. They have been reprimanded separately. The Director of the Public Security Bureau, who did not prevent this in advance, has also been given a warning punishment. The patrolmen of each shift have been ordered to be strictly restrained. As for the date of pay distribution by the District Office, it should be handled in accordance with the resolutions of the County Political Conference.</p>
<p>Danger of the Seawall: A Telegram Requesting Reinforcement: The County Chamber of Commerce convened a joint meeting of various trade associations on the 5th to raise donations for the flood disaster. It was unanimously resolved to raise a large sum in the shortest possible time and send it to the meeting for transfer. In view of the danger of the Jinshan Mouth seawall, it was further resolved to urgently telegraph the Construction Department of the Provincial Government. The message stated: "The Jinshan Mouth seawall has been destroyed again in this disaster. There are already breaches, and the danger is extremely urgent. We request that personnel be dispatched to supervise the work and block the breaches as soon as possible to protect lives." It is reported that Lu Zhidong, the Executive Member of the County, returned to Songjiang from Shanyang after his public business and personally saw the high tide. Over a thousand piles of wood in front were blown out, and the seawall had been destroyed in several places, making it extremely dangerous. He has appealed to the County Construction Bureau to quickly plan for a rainy day to protect people's lives.</p>

<p>Three Agencies Hold a Meeting to Investigate the Disaster Situation: This year's flood in Wu County has submerged over 300,000 acres of farmland, the severity of the disaster being unprecedented in twenty years. The township district offices have submitted requests to the county to exempt them from the grain tribute. Currently, the county government has organized a flood relief committee to handle the aftermath. Now, personnel have been dispatched by the County Government Finance Bureau and the County Farmers' Association, respectively, to depart on the 8th of this month to inspect the disaster situation in various affected areas.</p>
<p>Actively Developing Wu 30th May Road and Park Road: The Wu County Construction Bureau has received approval from the Construction Department to widen and rebuild 30th May Road and Park Road within the city and is urgently awaiting construction. The buildings that should be demolished on both sides of the two roads have long been announced and notified to be demolished and handed over within a time limit. Now that the time limit has passed, many owners are still hesitating, and the park, the Reformatory, the public sports field, etc., have not been handed over as required. As a result, the project cannot proceed. Yesterday (the 5th), Director Qian submitted a resolution to the Party and Government Talk Meeting that the houses obstructing the opening of the two roads should be demolished and handed over as required, and the public buildings in each of these places should take the lead in handing over to facilitate the project.</p>
<p>A Staff Member of the Rehabilitation Center Embezzles Funds and Flees: Wu Zhenglun, an assistant at the Jiangsu Rehabilitation Center, is in his early twenties. His father runs the Tongyihe Western Clothing Store on Pengpeng Road in Shanghai. Recently, he suddenly embezzled 515 yuan of public funds and fled. Yesterday (the 5th), the center sent a letter to the Detective Team, dispatching detectives to Shanghai to investigate and arrest him.</p>
<p>The Suspicious Death Case in Songjiang Will Be Re-Examined: In the case of the unclear death of the woman Hu Zhang in Songjiang County, an autopsy determined that she had committed suicide by hanging. The related parties, Hu Yinglong and Hu Hou, were declared innocent by the Wuxi County Court. The prosecutor did not agree and appealed to the High Court, sending Hu et al. along with nine packages of Hu Zhang's remains to Suzhou. Now, the High Court has sent the case back to the Wu County District Court for re-examination in order to be convincing.</p>

<p>The Bandit Zheng Ming and His Mother Meet, Disturbing the Northeast Township of Changshu: The bandit Zheng Ming, who is rampant in the area of Changshu Northeast Township, has been more rampant in various harbors since his father, Zheng Yushan, was executed in connection with a case. The detective team of the local Public Security Bureau arrested Zheng Ming in Shanghai and escorted him back to Changshu. He has confessed and is imprisoned in jail. Zheng learned that when his father was about to be executed, he had a Han jade bracelet that was preserved by the county government. Zheng Ming requested that the bracelet be returned when the court was in session. The official instructed him that his mother must come to claim it. Zheng then wrote a letter to his mother, Pan, asking her to come to the city. She arrived on the 3rd to visit him in prison. The bandit Zheng said to his mother, "You and I only have this one meeting today. You don't have to be sad. It's not like you only gave birth to one son. You can go back now. My father's Han jade bracelet is currently stored in the county government. You can go and claim it." His mother was extremely saddened upon hearing this and could only leave in tears. Pan then went to the county government and requested that the jade bracelet be returned. After Shen Cheng, the investigating official, approved it, she was allowed to take it. It is reported that the bracelet is indeed Han jade and was most loved by Deng Yushan during his lifetime.</p>
<p>Request to Reduce the Business Tax Amount Denied: The business tax of this county is contracted by the County Chamber of Commerce's organizing committee to the Provincial Department for 50,000 yuan per year, to be paid in four installments. Unexpectedly, since the start of collection, the business tax assessed is only 30,000 yuan, which is far from sufficient. A meeting was convened with various trade associations, and although more was agreed to be recognized, it was still difficult to meet the amount. In the latter part of last month, committee member Zhang Shouyi went to the province to personally meet with Director Xu of the Finance Department, intending to request a reduction of 20,000 yuan. Director Xu then said that this business tax was a contract signed by the responsible persons of both parties, the Chamber of Commerce, and should be adhered to. It is difficult to make changes during the contract period. At most, the recognition period can be shortened to the end of the year (half a year). The autumn and winter installments should still be handled according to the contract. Committee member Zhang had no choice but to return dejectedly.</p>

<p>Tragic News of a Yarn Factory Mechanic Losing an Arm: Zhou Erda, a twenty-one-year-old mechanic in the fine yarn room of the Yukon Yarn Factory under the North Xin Bridge in the Zhou Shanbang area of this county, was on duty at around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 4th). He used a bamboo ladder to climb onto the wheel and shaft to install the belt. Unfortunately, Zhou was careless, and his right arm was caught in the wheel and rotated with the belt. When Su Yunting, a mechanic from the same factory, caught sight of it, he immediately turned off the machine. However, Zhou's right arm had already been crushed by the wheel, his back of the head had been broken, and blood was flowing uncontrollably from his ear, leaving him completely unconscious, in a particularly tragic state. A female worker, Cai Xiaomei, thirteen years old, was watching nearby and was also hit in the head by the belt. Su Yunting immediately transported the two injured people to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Cai Xiaomei's injuries were not serious, but Zhou Erda's injuries were very serious, and his life was feared to be in danger. The Court Establishes a Real Estate Registration Office: The County Court of this county announced yesterday that real estate registration is established to prove rights and prevent disputes. The law is good, the intention is beautiful, the profits are small, and the effects are great. At the beginning of the establishment of the court, the registration office could not be established at the same time. As a result, property rights lawsuits have been increasing daily. In order to ensure the property rights of the people and clarify the source of litigation, the Jiangsu Higher Court has forwarded a request to the Judicial Administration Department for approval to establish a real estate registration office. It was officially established on August 1st. In addition to reporting it, the benefits of registration and the precautions regarding registration are listed below for the public to know. For real estate rights that occurred before July 31st of this year, registration must be applied for at the registration office of this court before September 30th. For registrations that occur after August 1st, the first deadline is one month for declaring registration. For registrations that occur after the deadline or are ordered to be registered due to other matters, the registration fee will be doubled. All should comply, and do not delay and misunderstand.</p>

County Magistrate Zhang immediately dispatched personnel to locate the Falun Temple and Guichi Guild Hall as shelters. The Jiangbei Flood Relief Temporary Charity Association telegraphed the county government on the 4th, reporting that the flood in Yancheng was severe, requiring urgent relief, especially boats. The county government has telegraphed various districts to seal and hire boats to be sent to the city for use.</p>
<p>Nantong's Disaster Relief Situation: The Nantong County Government telegraphed the provincial government on the 4th, reporting on the disaster relief efforts, stating that the relief personnel were now divided into groups and dispatched. The first group consisted of two tugboats, two tugboats, twenty civilian boats, one thousand bags of flour, and eight thousand pieces of dry food, departing from Nantong on the 29th. They arrived in Dongtai on the 1st and went to Xinghua on the 2nd. The second group consisted of two tugboats, three tugboats, twenty-two civilian boats, two hundred bags of flour, and seven thousand pieces of dry food, departing on the 2nd, gathering in Anfeng, and going to Xingdong. Preparations are still underway, but there is a severe shortage of funds for the boats, causing great difficulty.

<p>Yangzhong Suffers a Major Flood, Requests Urgent Relief: On the 26th of last month, around 3 AM, Yangzhong experienced strong winds and heavy rain, with a sudden surge in the river tide, causing the dikes to collapse and the banks to be breached. Villages and streets were submerged in water, almost leading to a catastrophe. Although the river tide has receded in the county, the breached dikes are still flooded. More than a hundred collapsed embankments inland have been hastily repaired, but the river dikes cannot be constructed due to the large scale of the work and the enormous cost. With the cool autumn approaching, the 30,000 to 40,000 disaster victims without clothing or food will be in dire straits. However, the county is barren and the people are poor, lacking wealthy merchants and households. There is no way to provide urgent relief. County Magistrate Bi has telegraphed the provincial government and various departments, appealing for urgent relief. The original telegram is recorded below: (Official titles omitted) Greetings. The Yangzhong flood caused the dikes to break, houses to collapse, and people to drown. The disaster victims gathered in crowds and made noise, almost causing trouble. I have repeatedly telegraphed, requesting you to send personnel to survey the area and issue urgent relief. Although the disaster situation may not be the most severe in the province, it is unprecedented in Yangzhong. The disaster victims are crying out for food and are easily emotionally agitated. The able-bodied men are working day and night, and it is difficult to ensure that they will not complain after prolonged labor. Although the county magistrate has done his best to appease them with sincerity, there is little practical benefit for the people. Therefore, I appeal again for prompt allocation of urgent relief and dispatch of personnel to survey and implement relief measures, to show that the county magistrate's appeal is not false, and to demonstrate that relief and rescue are not hopeless. Knowing that the provincial funds are stretched and difficult to allocate, if the need for relief can be met, the people's hearts can be calmed, and it will be easier to work for the aftermath. I submit this telegram with fear and trembling, expressing the utmost urgency.</p>

<p>Suspected Bandit Zhang Rizhong Apprehended: Li Xibai, a resident of Baitu Town, Fenghua, is currently working in the First Bandit Suppression Propaganda Department of the Nanjing General Headquarters. His father, Li Zunying, was at home when six or seven bandits suddenly came in early May of this year, kidnapped Li's father. Afterwards, his family repeatedly sent people to negotiate the ransom with the bandits, but the bandits, unable to get the price they demanded, tore up the ticket of Li's father last month. After Li heard the news in Nanjing, he returned to his hometown to find a way to retrieve his father's body for burial. Soon after, he learned that his father's kidnapping was actually due to his wife's brother, Zhang Rizhong, acting as an informant for the bandits. After Li returned to Nanjing, he specifically sent a letter to the local Public Security Bureau, instructing the Detective Team to strictly arrest and interrogate the suspect. Yesterday afternoon, Zhang was indeed captured on the Jiangbei bank of the South China Sea steamer. The suspect Zhang Rizhong has now been sent to the Public Security Bureau for verification and handling.</p>
<p>Representatives' Congress Telegraphed Request to Investigate Prosecutor: The Fifth All-County Representatives' Congress of Yin County believes that the prosecutor of the Yinxian District Court Prosecutor's Office, investigating the case of Yu Kangshu, the captain of the Ningbo Public Security Bureau Detective Team, executing the poor man He Shengtang, has been investigating for more than four months without concluding the investigation and filing a public prosecution. The handling is very inappropriate. The Representatives' Congress resolved (1) that the Congress telegraphed the Control Yuan to strictly handle the prosecutor in charge of this case and the captain of the Detective Team in accordance with Article 7 of the Impeachment Law; (2) that the Congress telegraphed the Provincial Executive Committee to send a letter to the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office to transfer jurisdiction of this case for prompt interrogation; (3) that the Congress telegraphed the Judicial Yuan to suspend the prosecutor handling this case from office for investigation. The Congress executed these resolutions last month. It is now learned that the Yin County Party Department received a reply telegram from the Judicial Yuan, the Administrative Department, which stated, "Qiaodai Telegram, has been issued to the Judicial Yuan for verification and handling. The Chief Prosecutor of the Zhejiang Higher Court has been ordered to send personnel to thoroughly investigate and verify the cause of He Shengtang's death and whether the handling of the prosecutor in charge of this case was inappropriate.

<p>European Bees Damage Crops, Farmers Appeal: A bee farm in Hanmiao Town keeps 130 hives. Recently, when the rice crops were budding, the bees swarmed out and damaged many crops, causing great panic among the farmers. They immediately gathered the whole village to negotiate with the bee farm, but without result. Instructor Zhang of the Farmers' Association reported to the county government to send personnel to mediate.

<p>Machine Weaving Workers Petition Over Dispute: When silk sales were sluggish in Wuxing silk factories and independent machine weaving workers, employers reduced wages by one cent per foot. Now that the silk market sales are slightly better, workers are demanding that employers restore the original price. However, employers claim that silk sales are still sluggish due to the floods in various places and refuse to raise prices, leading to a county-wide strike by independent machine weaving workers. The Party and government agencies have repeatedly intervened to mediate, but the labor and management sides have each held their ground, making a resolution ineffective. On the afternoon of the 2nd, Party and government officials were discussing solutions at the County Party Department. Fearing accidents, they summoned the police team to maintain order. Around 6 PM, more than nine hundred machine weaving workers, unable to endure any longer, rushed into the County Party Department to petition. The police team stepped forward to stop them, leading to a conflict. Police officers fired several shots as a warning, injuring the head of worker Lu A'gen. The workers still gathered and did not disperse, arguing for a long time. General Manager Yan of the business community and Team Leader Wang of the Security Team came forward to persuade them, promising that labor and management would each send representatives to the County Chamber of Commerce on the 3rd for concrete consultations. The injured workers were sent to the hospital for treatment. The workers dispersed late at night.</p>

<p>▲American Approval Regarding the loan of American wheat, a foreign member of the committee received a report from the American side yesterday afternoon stating that American President Hoover had officially announced the previous day that he would agree to loan 15 million bushels of American wheat to China. Regarding the interest rate, it can be reduced from approximately 4.5% to 4%. However, the committee did not hold any meetings last night regarding this matter because the report was received late yesterday, and Minister of Finance Song had not yet returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲Discussing Raising Huge Sums for Disaster Relief Yesterday, workgroup director Zhu Qinglan and others received a telegram from the Beijing Red Swastika Society, which read: "Generals Zhu and Chairman Xu, please note: We respectfully report that the great disaster has not ended, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers are again in danger. Alas, our people have been abandoned. Although the issuance of relief bonds has been decided, we fear it will be difficult to sell them all at once. We offer the following humble suggestions: (1) The Ministry of Finance should repay 14 types of domestic debt in September, totaling approximately 10,057,700 silver dollars. It seems possible to follow the old practice of only paying interest and postponing the repayment of principal for one year, and use this amount for disaster relief. (2) The British and German debts have been repaid. This customs revenue can be used to negotiate foreign loans from the United States, France, and other countries. (3) For countries with unsettled Boxer Indemnity funds, payments can be suspended for one or two years, as was done during the European War. For those with agreed uses, the budgeted silver funds in China will have surpluses due to the rising gold price, which can be negotiated with the Boxer Indemnity Committee members to be diverted to disaster relief. (4) In past disaster relief efforts, surcharges were levied on customs duties. This precedent can be used to negotiate with various envoys. If the Ministry of Finance agrees to the above four items, it should be possible to have 30 to 40 million dollars in cash available. Is this feasible? Please consider and decide. Xiong Xiling of the Swastika Headquarters bows and asks."</p>
<p>▲Request for Funds from the Beijing Shelter The National Government's Disaster Relief Committee: Minister Song's note: In response to the order from the Executive Yuan, the Capital City Flood Relief Association is approved to be dissolved. In the future, relief funds will be raised and allocated by the Disaster Relief Committee, and the relief and rehabilitation work will be handled by the Relief Affairs Committee together with the Nanjing Municipal Government. Upon receiving this order, the Capital City Disaster Relief Association was organized on the 3rd by personnel dispatched from this city to take over and continue the work. In addition to submitting a report, the original association had established three shelters. Due to the recent breaches of dikes and embankments in the suburbs, the number of disaster victims is increasing daily, with a total of over 35,000 people. At a cost of approximately five cents per person per day for half a pound of steamed buns, the monthly maintenance cost is estimated to be over 50,000 dollars. The funds transferred to the association amounted to only 2,000 dollars, which can only last for two days. Disaster victims from all over are continuously arriving in Beijing, and the situation is extremely urgent. We can only comply with the order and urgently request your committee to approve the advance allocation of 50,000 dollars to provide immediate relief. We urgently request that you remit the funds to Beijing by telegraph to provide relief. We eagerly await your order. The Nanjing Municipal Government Relief Affairs Committee respectfully requests. The committee replied by telegram: "To the Nanjing Relief Affairs Committee and the Municipal Government: We have just received your telegram. As there is an urgent need for funds to operate the disaster victim shelters, we approve the telegraphic transfer of 10,000 dollars from the Jin Cheng Bank tomorrow morning for urgent use. Please verify receipt and reply by telegram. The remaining funds will continue to be allocated by the Disaster Relief Committee."</p>
<h3 id="e114">City Chamber of Commerce Requests Use of Northeast Surplus Grain for Disaster Relief <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Sending Disaster Victims to Reclaim Wasteland and Develop Border Regions</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Nanjing National Government and Zhang, Deputy Commander-in-Chief in Shenyang, requesting that the surplus grain from the Northeast be used for disaster relief. The original telegram read: (abbreviated titles) "This year's floods have affected as many as sixteen provinces. Supplementing the people's food supply to prevent disaster victims from dying is the most urgent task of the moment. Although the government has a proposal to loan wheat flour from the United States, the phased shipment to China will inevitably be too slow. It is better to seek domestically first, as the proximity will save provincial expenses, and the price will naturally be cheaper than purchasing from abroad. Moreover, no matter how hard we try to raise disaster relief funds, the vastness of the disaster area will inevitably be just a drop in the ocean. At this time, purchasing food, if possible, should prioritize domestic food supplies from areas with low prices. Arriving a day earlier means saving lives a day earlier. Saving a penny of expenses is equivalent to raising a penny of disaster relief funds. The advantages and disadvantages are obvious and need no further explanation. In the three northeastern provinces, except for the Liao River basin, which suffered from floods, all other areas have reported bumper harvests year after year. Surplus grain is piled up on the fields, leading to sluggish sales and goods being abandoned on the ground, resulting in the financial panic and industrial decline of the previous year. Recently, thousands of warehouses and tens of thousands of boxes of grain have been cheaply loaded and taken away by Soviet Russia, causing disaster victims in the southeast to lament that they have no way to buy grain. Is this not an abnormal phenomenon? According to reports, the Northeast has surplus grain of no less than 5 million tons. The stock is abundant and the price is low. From soybeans and sorghum to wheat flour and rice, everything is available. Rice is only nine cents per pound, and 100 pounds only cost nine dollars, which is cheaper than foreign rice. It is particularly suitable for sales. Moreover, the people in the sixteen provinces affected by the disaster do not all eat rice. Using coarse grains for disaster relief is a common practice throughout history. Soybeans and sorghum can all be used for disaster relief food and there is no need to worry about incompatibility. We should issue a clear order to use all the surplus grain from the Northeast at a fair price for disaster relief, allowing merchants to transport it freely. For maritime transport, transit tariffs should be waived. For land transport, railway freight rates should be greatly reduced. In such a shift, the Northeast will immediately see signs of commercial recovery, and the disaster areas will not have to worry about corpses on the roads. It is truly beneficial to both national welfare and people's livelihood. Furthermore, for famine victims from various provinces whose customs and habits are similar to those in the north and who are willing to go to Guanwai to make a living, the government or organizations should allocate funds for disaster relief to send them there in batches. This will be a long-term benefit for reclaiming wasteland and developing border regions. We respectfully offer our humble opinions and hope that you will adopt them. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows and sings."</p>

<p>Cheng Jingsheng's Report on His Inspection Trip Back to Shanghai</p>
<p>Cheng Jingsheng, Director of the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, established a resident office of the association in Zhenjiang and cooperated with the Jiangbei Flood Relief Temporary Relief Association, which was organized by Leng Yuqiu and Lu Xiaobo in Zhenjiang, to provide emergency relief to the victims in Gao, Shao, Ji, and the lower reaches of the river. Mr. Cheng personally went to Jiangbei to conduct a field survey of the disaster situation in various counties and the latest progress report on the relief work is excerpted below.</p>
<p>Summary Report on the Disaster Situation and Emergency Relief Work in Various Counties: The disaster area in Jiangbei is very wide. Gaoyou City, Shaobo Town, and the surrounding villages were the most severely affected. Shaobo, starting from the Six Gates, passing through Majia Gate, Dawang Temple, Jimaodai, the South Street of Shaobo Town, the north and south of Wanshou Palace, and ending at Zhaoguan Dam and Hehua Pond, had more than 20 breaches, ranging in width from ten to fifty or sixty zhang. More than half of the town's houses were destroyed. Rivers and lakes overflowed, creating a boundless expanse. The surrounding villages, such as Zhenwu Temple, Qiaoshu Town, Gongdao Bridge Fangjia Lane, and other remote small villages, which were located in low-lying areas, had all their houses submerged in water, suffering even more severely. Roofs and treetops became the areas where disaster victims fled for their lives, but their cries went unheard and rescue was not timely. The elderly and young were unable to climb and were swept away by the waves. The number of those who became victims of the water is difficult to estimate. Gaoyou’s Lujin Temple had a breach of more than 30 zhang to the south, 50 zhang to the north, 80 zhang at Twenty Li Pu, 40 zhang at Qigong Temple, 20 zhang at Yumatou, 50 zhang at Miaoxiang, and 80 zhang at Dangjunlou. The water force at Zhaoguan Dam and Dangjunlou was dangerous and the breaches were widening daily. If they are not repaired quickly, the consequences could be dire. The area outside the north gate is the commercial center and was the most prosperous. Now, it is a vast expanse of water, like a sea. The water is rushing and sounds like a bell. It flows eastward, and the sight is frightening. Although the city is fortunate not to have been completely submerged, the water depth has reached four or five feet and cannot be drained. Residents have fled to the city walls or climbed onto rooftops. Cooking fires have long been extinguished, and the water vapor is scorching. Even if they do not die in the flood now, it will be difficult to avoid dying from plague in the future. The vast countryside is several feet deep in water, and countless disaster victims are being swept away. The number of deaths in Gaoyou and Shao is extremely high. Floating corpses are seen in the waves, which is heartbreaking. Although there are no precise statistics, the number of casualties is said to be over 10,000. More than 10,000 who were rescued were sent to Yangzhou and Zhenjiang for shelter. This is the disaster situation in the upper reaches of the river. Since the dikes in Gaoyou and Shao broke, the Huai River has been flowing eastward, and the counties in the lower reaches of the river, such as Taizhou, Dongtai, and Xinghua, are the first to bear the brunt. The water level is rising daily, and cities and villages have mostly become swamps. The Taizhou Relief Association telegraphed that floating corpses have been seen in the countryside. Recently, they urgently telegraphed again, saying that two-thirds of the entire territory is submerged in water, and there are hundreds of thousands of disaster victims. Only more than 20,000 have been rescued so far, and the rest are still trapped in the water. The wind is strong and the water is rising, and rescue is extremely urgent. They requested that ships be dispatched quickly with food to provide relief. They also received a telegram from the leader of the third team of the Jiangbei Flood Relief Temporary Relief Association, saying that the disaster situation in Taizhou is extremely severe, and the food they brought is not enough to distribute. They urgently requested assistance. The Yun di dike in Dongtai collapsed, and the disaster situation is extremely severe. Telegrams for help were sent repeatedly. The magistrate of Rugao telegraphed that he has dispatched ships to assist and set up shelters. Xinghua is located in a low-lying area, and communication is cut off. The disaster situation can be imagined. In Zhenjiang County, Mashang Township and Gaozi Township in the second district, Tubin Township and Baolian Township in the fifth district, and Yulong Xin Zhou and Shunjiang Lao Zhou in the seventh district are all located along the Yangtze River. Recently, they have been affected by the impact of the river tides, and the dikes and embankments have collapsed. Houses, fields, and livestock have all been submerged, and tens of thousands of disaster victims are in a very miserable situation. According to the county magistrate and representatives of the disaster victims, letters and telegrams have been sent requesting assistance. Upon investigation, it was confirmed to be true. Funing, Rugao, and Taixing have all telegraphed about the disaster situation. Jiangning County’s Jiangxin Zhou and Jiangdu County’s Fogan Zhou and Zaixing Zhou have all breached their dikes and requested relief from the Jiangbei Flood Relief Temporary Relief Association and the resident office of this association. Personnel have been dispatched to investigate. However, the situation in Gaoyou and Shao was reported by Provincial Committee member Shi Zhiyun and National Flood Disaster Relief Committee member Jin Shude after personal inspections, which has been confirmed. Dongtai and Taixing have been repeatedly telegraphing for help in recent days. The disaster situation is expected to increase daily. A more accurate report will be submitted once the investigators return. This is the general disaster situation in various counties obtained in recent days.</p>
<p>Emergency relief in the disaster areas has been dispatched one after another by the Jiangbei Flood Relief Temporary Relief Association and the resident office of this association. As of September 1st, a total of five teams have been dispatched. The first team went to Xinghua and Dongtai, led by team leader Liu Yihang. The second team went to Gaoyou and Shao, led by team leader Zhou Zigeng. (On the day the dikes in Gaoyou and Shao broke, the Red Swastika Society dispatched members to lead ships to provide relief and telegraphed Yangzhou to send personnel to assist. More than 5,000 people were rescued. Zhou's trip was the third time disaster.) The third team went to Taixing and Dongtai, led by team leader Xu Xinshan. The fourth team went to Fanchuan, Xiaoji, and Zhouzhuang, led by team leader Yuan Xujiang. The fifth team went to Xinghua Shagou, led by team leader Tang Shiqing. Each team brought fourteen ships, tugboats, and more than twenty civilian boats, all carrying rice, noodles, sesame cakes, Jiang Guo Ba, Luo Gan brown sugar, ginger, straw paper, matches, candles, and epidemic prevention medicines to provide emergency relief. They were also instructed to hire small boats locally to go to the villages to find and rescue disaster victims and send them to various shelters. This is the general situation of the teams' departures in recent days. The disaster victims transported from the disaster areas to</p>
<p>The number of disaster victims in various shelters, including Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, has reached more than 10,000, and the number of disaster victims in Taixing has exceeded 20,000. Telegrams were sent to Nantong, Rugao, Taixing, and other counties to set up shelters, and the association provided funding. The replies from the governments of Tong, Rugao, and Taixing stated that they are rushing to handle the matter. However, due to the vast disaster area and the great distance between Xingdong, Gaoyou, and Shao, communication and the dispatch of ships to provide food were delayed. In order to expedite the response to the situation, it was decided to set up branch offices along the way in Yangzhou, Taixing, and the lower reaches of the river, and to invite one director and one deputy director to cooperate with local officials, gentry, and local organizations to handle the matter quickly and avoid delays. Five branch offices have been set up and are currently dispatching teams one after another, focusing on searching for disaster victims in various villages and planning for future plans. This is the general situation of the association's work in recent days. As for the actual situation in the disaster area, Yuqiu plans to go to investigate with Xiaobo in person in the near future. After returning to Zhenjiang, a more accurate report will be submitted.</p>
<p>Another report states that Cheng Jingsheng, Deputy Director of the Association, and temporary staff members Hu Junzhong and Hong, went to Gaobin and Shaobo in Jiangbei to conduct a field survey and returned to Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday. It is said that there is a very detailed report.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Zhu Qichen's Report on His Inspection of Disaster Relief in Wuhan <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association publicly appointed standing committee member Zhu Qichen to take charge of emergency relief in Wuhan. He traveled with many relief workers, carrying 60,000 dollars in relief funds, 10,000 bags of flour, and 40,000 bottles of relief medicine to investigate the details and provide effective relief. A letter has been received from Director Zhu, reporting that Qichen and his relief workers arrived in Hankou on August 26 and temporarily stayed in Room 40 of the Central Hotel, which served as a temporary office. The water in the room was more than three feet deep, and the foul air was unbearable. The mosquitoes were so numerous that it was difficult to sleep all night. Mosquito nets and mosquito coils were ineffective. Other locations were even more deeply submerged. Fortunately, the water and electricity companies and the water plant were well-protected, and there was no shortage of drinking water. However, the lights in the German and Japanese concessions were submerged and had long been plunged into darkness. It was impossible to enter and leave without a boat, and transportation was extremely difficult. Since the flooding of Hankou, the water depth is still more than ten feet in some places and several feet in others. There are ninety-eight shelters in Hankou, mostly run by charitable organizations, with varying sizes. For example, the Xinshichang Charitable Society can accommodate more than 3,000 people in each shelter, while smaller ones can only accommodate dozens of people. There are seventeen shelters in Wuchang, and Xiao runs a single shelter in Hanyang that can accommodate several thousand people. In terms of shelters alone, government funds account for about 30%. Before the Qingshan Dike broke, there were about 300,000 disaster victims. After the dike broke, the number increased by 200,000, for a total of about 500,000 disaster victims. This does not include those in other counties. They are currently living in the open air in Hongshan, Sheshan, Meizishan, Fenghuangshan, Guishan, and Heishan. Temporary thatched huts are being rushed to be built. Reed mats have been ordered from Shanghai, and wooden poles are being erected on the mountains to build thatched huts, which should be completed soon. The association plans to provide a portion of the food. Four relief workers have been sent to Dunrentang and other shelters in Hankou, totaling fourteen shelters, to begin an investigation. It is estimated that there are more than 3,000 refugees. We are working with Cai Fuqing, He Hengfu, and Wan Songtao to take over and provide flour, calculated for two months, which will cost about 20,000 dollars. The current disaster situation is serious and there are many refugees. Without urgently raising huge sums of money and preparing more cotton-padded clothing, it will not be enough to help in the future. This relief effort in Wuhan should be viewed with a long-term perspective. The Yangtze River basin is interconnected and its safety is related. If the disaster victims in Wuhan are rescued, the disasters in the downstream areas can be alleviated. It is hoped that charities in Shanghai will pay attention to this. According to the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, He Hengfu and Huang Wenzhi, the disaster situation in Cai Dian in Hanyang is extremely severe. They plan to cooperate with the association and send people together to investigate before making a decision.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Standing Committee Meeting of the Emergency Relief Association <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Standing Committee of the Emergency Relief Association of Various Provinces held a temporary meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Xu Junren presided over the meeting. Qu Wenliu reported on the Baotang Dike Rescue Project. Yu Hongjun from the Municipal Government attended the meeting to discuss the situation. Mr. Yu was also present to describe everything in detail. Wang Xiaolai and Zhang Xiaolin proposed that the Baotang Dike Rescue Project was an urgent matter and that since the Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau was responsible for it, the Jiangsu Province should be telegraphed to immediately telegraph the 100,000 dollars originally planned for the provincial treasury to the Shanghai Municipal Government. The association would also assist with 50,000 dollars, which would be advanced by Mr. Zhang Xiaolin. It was estimated that another 50,000 dollars would be needed, which the Municipal Government would be responsible for raising. It was also requested that the Municipal Government be responsible for the repair of all important dike projects besides Baotang, such as Liuhe. This was unanimously approved. The Disaster Relief Bond Issue was discussed and it was resolved to send a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, urging them to issue the bonds as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e118">City Party Headquarters Issues Guidelines for Soliciting Donations for Disaster Relief <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The city's Party member disaster relief donation teams, with designated team leaders and sub-team leaders appointed by the city Party headquarters, are actively proceeding with their work. The City Executive Committee yesterday also formulated a set of guidelines for soliciting donations for disaster relief and distributed them to the donation personnel for compliance. The second and third districts separately convened meetings with the branch team leaders to discuss the situation. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Second District Team The second district Party branch sub-team leader, Wang Deyi, specially convened a meeting yesterday with the branch team leaders, including Wang Chunyuan of the 24th branch, Luo Lie of the 28th branch, Liu Jiwu of the 3rd branch, Mao Xiaxuan of the 18th branch, Wang Guan of the 11th branch, Yu Jinluo of the 22nd branch, Liu Yun of the 15th branch, Zhou Shuwang of the 2nd branch, Mei Guozhen of the 20th branch, and more than ten others. The sub-team leader reported on the disaster situation and the suffering of the victims in various places, saying, "Tens of millions of compatriots have been affected by the disaster and are in dire need of food. Disaster relief is like fighting a fire. I hope that all branch team leaders will quickly do their best to solicit donations." At the end, several methods of implementation were agreed upon. Starting today, donations will be solicited from all walks of life, and they will be concluded every two weeks and submitted to the City Party Headquarters for distribution.</p>
<p>▲ Third District Team The leader of the Party member disaster relief donation team of the third district Party headquarters of this city is Comrade Tang Liqing, an executive committee member of the district, appointed by the city Party committee. The branch team leaders are the standing committee members of each district branch. The district executive committee has already forwarded the order to its subordinates for guidance and has sent a letter to the district team leader to follow suit. The district team leader Tang has scheduled a meeting tomorrow (the 7th) at 1:00 PM to convene a discussion meeting with all branch team leaders (i.e., the standing committee members of each branch) to discuss implementation methods. The notice was issued yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Key Points of Solicitation The guidelines for soliciting donations for disaster relief formulated by the City Executive Committee of this city are as follows: (1) Explain the extreme severity of this flood disaster. (2) Explain that this flood disaster requires assistance from individuals, society, and the nation. (3) Explain that Party comrades should especially rise up to help with disaster relief. This time, the heavy rains in the southeastern provinces have caused a disaster, with floods inundating the area, houses collapsing, and people and animals being drowned. The magnitude of the disaster is unbearable to witness. In Yutang, Hunan, thousands of people were swept away. The once prosperous three towns of Wuhan are now submerged. Other areas, such as the rice-producing areas of northern Anhui and the affluent areas of southern Jiangsu, are all a vast expanse of water without end. The mighty Yangtze and Han rivers are still surging. The vast lands of Yu are in danger of being submerged. The living have been reduced to starving people, and the disaster area is so vast that it spans almost the entire country, accounting for two-thirds of the national area. The number of victims is at least 50 million or more. This is truly a major change for the country and a strange disaster for the nation, which we cannot ignore in the slightest. Since the disaster is so severe, the disaster area is so large, and the number of victims is so numerous, relying solely on government relief is not only limited by financial resources but also may lead to neglecting one area for another. It is essential that the people of the whole country rise up together to overcome this great difficulty and carry out a movement to save people and save themselves. The people of Shanghai, in particular, have an undeniable responsibility. The reasons are as follows: 1. From the individual perspective, this flood disaster affects sixteen provinces, with five or six being severely affected and more than ten major cities and ports being hit. Shanghai is fortunate to have escaped this calamity. While our compatriots are trapped in the water, we are living in peace. Think of the 50 million compatriots in the Jianghuai and Hehan regions who have lost their homes and have no place to live, no clothes to keep warm, and no food to eat. They have no way to go to heaven and no way to enter the earth. Whenever we think of this tragic situation, we cannot help but shed tears. All our comrades and compatriots should have the heart to alleviate the hunger and suffering of others and do their best to fulfill their heavenly duty of helping those affected by the disaster. Moreover, Shanghai is a place where people from all over gather, and most are from various provinces. In addition to the relationship between compatriots, there is also the kinship of hometowns and villages. We should help them as fellow countrymen and as fellow villagers. Furthermore, Shanghai is the commercial center of the country, known for its strong financial resources, and extravagance prevails. The consumption of wine and food and the waste of luxury goods are countless every day. People from all walks of life should, in this time of great calamity, tighten their belts and save money to provide substantial assistance and set an example for the whole country. 2. From the social perspective, (A) if we cannot provide relief to the victims and ensure that they have food and shelter, then those who are left to die in ditches are extremely pitiful, and diseases and epidemics will spread endlessly, which is a great hidden danger for society. Not only that, but the victims who have lost their homes and jobs will seek a way to survive in all directions. If they cannot find a way to survive, they will be forced to take risks. A few will become thieves, and many will become bandits. They will kill and rob, or plot rebellion. Moreover, the communists in the country have not yet been completely wiped out, and they will inevitably tempt and incite the victims to take advantage of the situation and launch surprise attacks. Social order will be difficult to maintain, and the country will face a major disaster. 3. From the national perspective, our country's production is backward, and the economy cannot be self-sufficient. Now, the production functions and tools of sixteen provinces and regions have been destroyed, and the victims in the area cannot be saved. The country's food and other supplies will be completely exhausted, and the foundation of the social economy will be fundamentally shaken. The future of the country is unimaginable. As citizens, we should rush to the aid of the country and jointly seek to restore the order of the national economy. In summary, we know that we should all do our best to help with this flood disaster. As Party comrades, we bear the heavy responsibility of saving the country. At this time of national crisis, we should all do our best to contribute our intelligence and talent to the Party and the country. We should also contribute generously to the extent of our financial resources and provide practical assistance. We must know that every little bit helps, and every grain of sand can form a pagoda. This will not only benefit the disaster victims and give peace of mind but also benefit the foundation of the Party, the foundation of the country, and the livelihood of the society and the people.

<h3 id="e119">Establishment of the Hubei Relief Office in Shanghai <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Hubei Flood Relief Association sent a public telegram stating: "To the Shanghai City Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Shanghai Office of the Central Relief Commission, the Public Security Bureau, and all newspapers: We have just received a telegram from the relief office in Shanghai stating, 'We have received your telegram. We immediately convened a meeting of all the committee members and named it the Shanghai Relief Office of the Hubei Flood Relief Association. Mr. Jiang Yuxu was publicly elected as the chairman of the committee. The office is temporarily located at 78 Gongshun Lane, Wuma Road. Please inform the Party and municipal authorities in Shanghai to take note and file it for record. We hereby report this matter and respectfully request your attention.' Our association resolved at the tenth standing meeting to establish relief offices in Nanjing and Shanghai. We have already telegraphed the fellow villagers in Shanghai. Now, in accordance with the previous request, in addition to sending telegrams to other parties, we are sending a special telegram to you, hoping that you will take note and file it for record and provide assistance at any time. We wish you success. Hubei Flood Relief Association."</p>

<p>▲ Youzheng Bookstore Donates 3,000 Yuan The Youzheng Bookstore on Wangping Street held a three-day sale at a low price to help with disaster relief. However, due to the rainy weather, only 720 yuan was sold. The owner, Di Chuqing, made up the difference to 3,000 yuan, sending 1,000 yuan to the Disaster Relief Associations of various provinces and the remaining 1,000 yuan each to the Jiangsu Charity Relief Association and the Liyang Flood Relief Association.</p>
<p>▲ Egg Industry Concludes Fundraising After Raising a Large Sum The committee members of the Egg Industry Association have raised a large sum of money through the enthusiastic donations of their members. A total of 10,245.5 yuan in cash, 150 taels of silver, and 4 dimes in small foreign currency have been received. After sending the money to various relief organizations, they will hold a closing ceremony.</p>
<p>▲ Meeting of the Clothing and Bedding Disaster Relief Association The Clothing and Bedding Disaster Relief Association held a meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday at its general office at 207 Mengdelan Road. Those present included Lu Jianai, Cai Nipei, Shang Mujiang, Jiang Xiahun, Fan Fayuan, Chen Kuitang, Ni Songlin, Huang Chunzhou, Zhu Caiyin, and dozens of others. The meeting began at 5:00 PM, and Lu Jianai was elected as the temporary chairman and Zhu Caiyin as the secretary. First, Mr. Huang Chunzhou reported on the progress of the association, explaining that the public has been enthusiastically donating cotton-padded clothes in large numbers, reaching thousands of pieces. Chairman Lu proposed that the association's expenses should not be covered by external donations. Chairman Lu and Cai Nipei and others first donated 100 yuan each. It was decided that the fundraising methods would be divided into manual and written publicity to implement the work. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Corps also sent a representative, Mr. Wang Yingqi, to the meeting, hoping that members would be willing to volunteer for publicity work. The meeting adjourned at around 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Staff Members Donate Meal Savings for Disaster Relief The municipal committee members and related personnel of this city have formed a dining club that meets once every two weeks. There are currently more than 30 members. They take turns hosting a week every five months. The other day, the members of the association had dinner at the Dajiali Restaurant on Beijing Road. Mr. Yang Bingxing proposed that since the flood disaster is so severe, we should not abolish our dining club, as it is related to the discussion of official matters. However, we should tighten our belts and donate the savings to disaster relief. Each time, three people can save 30 yuan. If we calculate by week, we can get more than 300 yuan. The money should be donated first to provide relief to the flood victims in Jiangsu Province on a weekly basis until the end of the disaster relief. It was decided that each person would first donate 10 yuan as a week's savings. The money will be brought to the next dinner meeting. Wang Binyan was appointed as the cashier. If the disaster does not subside, a second week of donations will be considered.</p>
<p>▲ Taikang Company Jointly Donates 200 Yuan The colleagues at the Nanjing Road branch of Taikang Company contributed 10% of their September salaries and the Mid-Autumn Festival feast money, totaling 200 yuan, which has been entrusted to Liu Jingchuan to be handed over to the relief agencies.</p>
<p>▲ Shenchang Foreign Firm's Chinese Employees Donate More Than 1,000 Yuan The Chinese Employees' Association of the American firm Shenchang Foreign Firm raised a total of 1,075.56 yuan in donations from the firm's employees for the flood disaster. The money has been sent to the Publicity Group for transfer to the Jincheng Bank.</p>
<p>▲ Central Hotel Employees Donate 311 Yuan Shen Changgeng, the assistant manager of the Central Hotel on Wuma Road, raised 311 yuan in donations from the hotel's employees for disaster relief, which was submitted to the Disaster Relief Association yesterday for distribution.</p>
<p>▲ Qiuxin Workers Donate to Help Disaster Relief The Qiuxin Office of the First District Shipbuilding Industry Union convened a meeting of all group leaders at 5:00 PM yesterday and resolved that each worker would donate half a day's wages to help with disaster relief.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Labor Disputes Involving French Tram Workers Expand <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Tram Service Suspended Yesterday</p>
<p>French Concession Under Temporary Martial Law</p>
<p>Union Asks Company for Forgiveness</p>
<p>Seven Workers Sentenced to Imprisonment</p>
<p>Workers at the French Concession Electric Light Company were connecting a power line at the home of a Mr. Gao at No. 5 Shenyu Lane, Huacheng Road, at 11:00 AM the day before. Because they leaned a bamboo ladder against the back door of No. 4, a dispute arose with Li E'e, a woman from Ningbo living in No. 4. Then, at 5:30 PM, the workers invited more people to take revenge, which led to a major disturbance in front of the Songshan Road police station. Since the case occurred, all trams in the French Concession have been declared on strike since 9:00 PM the night before. Therefore, all public buses and trams on the roads of the French Concession were completely suspended yesterday. The French police paid great attention and dispatched Chinese and Western police officers on duty, all armed, to protect the area. The iron gates on the road from Xiaodongmen to Xieqiao on the Republic Road were all closed, leaving only small doors for traffic. The details are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Workers Go on Strike More than 1,200 workers in more than 20 departments of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company's Mechanical Department, including the lathe, tap water engineering office, painters, fire meter connection, large warehouse, carpenters, motors, and Dongjiadu water engine railroad, went on strike together at 6:30 AM yesterday to support the arrested workers.</p>
<p>▲ Demanding Bail The Second District Water and Electricity Industry Union (i.e., the French Concession Water and Electricity Mechanical Department) sent representatives Lu Guanhong, Zhang Renjun, Qiao Lingen, and Zheng Deshun to the company yesterday morning to negotiate with the director, Meng Suolang, demanding that the company bail out the arrested workers Zhu A'long, Yu Haiquan, Cao Liang, and Chen A'xi. The director said that it was not a matter for the company and that he could not interfere, so he had to wait for the Second Special District Court to resolve it.</p>
<p>▲ Workers' Congress All the workers in the Mechanical Department held a congress at the company at 275 Luban Road at 11:00 AM yesterday. The chairman was Zhang Yinsheng. First, Zhang Renjun reported on the negotiations with the director. Due to time constraints, the chairman announced that the meeting would continue at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. However, all the workers insisted on demanding the release of the arrested workers. By the afternoon, the company had closed the factory gates and stationed a large number of armed detectives, so the meeting could not be held.</p>
<p>▲ More Arrests The French Concession Water and Electricity Company closed the factory gates in the afternoon due to the workers' strike and stationed Chinese and Western armed detectives. After the workers finished lunch, they prepared to enter the factory to work, but because the factory gates were closed, they could not enter and temporarily went to the union to await orders. At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Zhu A'san, a worker in the machine shop of the Mechanical Department, was arrested in Lujiawan and taken to the Lujiaqiao police station.</p>
<p>▲ Mediation in Progress The Second District Water and Electricity Union held a discussion meeting at the union yesterday afternoon. Zhang Yinsheng, Zhang Renjun, Lu Guanhong, and Qiao Lingen were sent to ask Du Yuesheng to mediate at 4:20 PM. As a result, all the workers returned to work first, and the rest would be investigated. The company would not refuse the workers to return to work. The union would prepare a letter to the company and the police station to clarify everything.</p>
<p>▲ Statement of Misunderstanding The Second District Water and Electricity Union sent a letter to the French Concession Water and Electricity Company yesterday, stating, "Dear Director, this unfortunate incident was caused by a small matter that escalated into a dispute. It was a misunderstanding by the workers. In order to resolve the matter, the person in charge of our union has notified everyone to return to work together and await a resolution. We hope that you, the director, will forgive us. Sincerely, Tram Company Director." A letter was also sent to the Songshan Road police station to clarify the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>▲ Announcement of Resumption of Work The Second District Water and Electricity Union announced the resumption of work yesterday afternoon, stating, "Regarding the dispute, the representatives are negotiating with Mr. Du Yuesheng, who has accepted the mediation. All our workers will resume work as usual on Monday. The night shift workers in the old and new workshops, engine rooms, and Dongjiadu will work as usual tonight (i.e., yesterday)." Therefore, the night shift workers entered the factory to resume work at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Court Judgment The arrested workers Zhu A'long, Yu Haiquan, Cao Liang, Chen A'xue, Gao A'fu, Zhao Jinsheng, and Chen Baobao were escorted to the Second Special District District Court by the police station yesterday. The criminal court president, Ge Zhitan, together with prosecutor Ding Shikui and clerk Chen Weihan, sat in the criminal court for interrogation and announced that the case was serious and that all onlookers were prohibited. Judge Ge first asked the defendants their names, ages, and native places. Then, Fei Xizhen, the police station's lawyer, stood up to state the case, saying that the case arose from the fact that the electric light company sent craftsmen Chen Xiangyun and A'mao to connect a power line at the home of a Mr. Gao at No. 5 Shenyu Lane, Huacheng Road, at 11:00 AM yesterday morning. They leaned a bamboo ladder against the back door of No. 4. However, the alley was narrow, and Li E'e, a woman living in No. 4, was going out to buy things. She thought that the bamboo ladder was leaning against the door and blocking traffic, so she asked them to move it. However, the workers not only ignored her but also teased her. The two sides got into an argument, and the workers even slapped Li E'e in the face, which angered the neighbors who took sides and beat the three workers. The workers were humiliated and unwilling to accept this, so they took advantage of their time off work at 5:00 PM and invited more than 100 workers to look for trouble at No. 4 Shenyu Lane, Huacheng Road. At that time, Li Genfa, Li E'e's brother, who worked at the Dalei Foreign Firm, came home from work and saw this situation. He asked the workers for the reason, but the workers did not ask questions and beat Li. Li saw that the situation was not good and fled into the building at No. 32 Huacheng Road, climbed over the fence from the sun deck into another house, and escaped. At that time, the workers scattered. One of the workers grabbed Li's raincoat and walked to the Quan'an Teahouse on Baxianqiao. The victim, Li Genfa's friend Zhuang Zifa, caught a glimpse of him and reported it to the Songshan Road police station, which immediately dispatched three Chinese police officers, No. 370, No. 340, and No. 675, to the Quan'an Teahouse to arrest him. However, the workers beat the police officers again. At that time, only three workers, including Li Hesheng, were arrested and taken to the police station. They were interrogated and released because they were not related to the case. Unexpectedly, more than 200 workers rushed to the Songshan Road police station, intending to forcibly release the arrested workers. The workers were fierce and aggressive. At that time, the victim Li Genfa arrived at the police station gate by car and was beaten by the workers again. The chief of the Criminal Department, the Western detective Bao Erdi, the Russian detective Dula Cai Fu, and the Western patrol head No. 61 were also injured. Patrol head No. 61 drew his gun and fired two shots into the air for self-defense. At that time, the chief patrol Feiwoli and the tram company director were also at the scene. Seeing this fierce situation, they ordered the police to disperse the workers by force and arrested the seven defendants one after another. Now, the police station is prosecuting them for obstructing official duties under Article 143 of the Criminal Law, disrupting order under Article 156, gathering a crowd for robbery and coercion under Article 157, demanding release by violent acts under Article 171, and obstructing traffic due to others under Article 202. Then, the plaintiff Li Genfa was interrogated. He stated that he was 24 years old, from Ningbo, and lived at No. 4 Shenyu Lane. He worked at the Dalei Foreign Firm. When the workers had a dispute with his sister yesterday morning, he was at work, so he did not know the situation. It was not until 3:00 PM that his sister called to inform him. He came home from work at 5:00 PM and saw many workers at the alley entrance. He went forward to ask, but they beat him with iron rods without asking questions, saying that they would kill him. Fortunately, he saw that the situation was not good and fled into the building at No. 32, climbed over the fence from the sun deck into No. 18, and escaped. However, he had been seriously injured all over. He had been examined at the Blue Cross Society, and there was a medical report to prove it. However, when he was beaten, he lost a raincoat and 30 yuan in cash. Li E'e stated that she was 16 years old. Yesterday morning, three workers were connecting a line at No. 5 next door, and they leaned a bamboo ladder against the back door. When the woman went out to buy coal balls, she asked them to move the ladder. However, the workers not only refused but also threw mud at her and teased her at will. At that time, the woman reasoned with them, and they scolded her as a slut and slapped her in the face. The woman was humiliated and fled home. Later, others saw this and beat the workers. When the workers left, they said that they would come back for revenge later. Unexpectedly, at 5:00 PM, more than 100 workers came to seek revenge and rushed into her house first. Fortunately, the woman fled into the front building and was not beaten. Later, the woman heard that her brother was being beaten by the workers on the road, so she tried her best to go out and wanted to take a car to report to the police station, but she was also stopped and beaten by the workers. There were injuries that could be proven. The judge asked the defendants if they were the perpetrators at the scene. Li E'e pointed out that the first defendant, Zhu A'long, was the one who beat her. Then, the witness Zhuang Zifa was interrogated. He stated that he was a merchant and worked in a customs brokerage. Li Genfa was his friend. Yesterday afternoon, the merchant went to Li's house because of something, but Li had not yet returned. After a while, he heard that Li Genfa was being beaten by the workers at the alley entrance. When the merchant went out to rescue him, the workers had all fled. The merchant only saw a worker carrying Li Genfa's raincoat and walking north. He followed him, intending to find an opportunity to report to the police. He then saw the worker go to the Quan'an Teahouse to sip tea. Therefore, the merchant reported to the police station and dispatched the police to go with the merchant to arrest him. However, the workers were extremely rude and dared to commit violence again, beating the merchant and the police together. The merchant's waist was injured from the beating. He requested an examination. The judge asked which of the workers in the case were the perpetrators at the scene. The answer was that the first defendant, Zhu A'long, was indeed the perpetrator who beat Li E'e. At this point, the judge ordered the forensic doctor Wei Ligong to take the three plaintiffs to the back rest room for examination. Then, Dr. Wei reported that Li Genfa and Zhuang Zifa had indeed been injured, which was consistent with the medical report from the Blue Cross Society. As for the injury suffered by the woman Li E'e, it could not be examined for the time being because the plaster was applied. According to the head of the Western patrol No. 61, he was ordered to mobilize the entire reserve team of patrol officers at the Songshan Road police station at 6:00 PM yesterday to disperse the crowd. However, the workers refused to obey and surrounded him, trying to seize his gun. Therefore, he got an opportunity to draw his gun and fire into the air to defend himself, but his finger was also injured by the workers. According to Bao Erdi, the head of the Criminal Department, he had submitted a written report, but his injuries were very minor. According to the Chinese patrol officers No. 370, No. 340, and No. 675, they were ordered to go with Zhuang Zifa to the Quan'an Teahouse to arrest the workers, and they were all beaten. The defendant Zhu A'long stated that he and the craftsman Zhu Xiangyun were colleagues. After leaving work at 5:00 PM yesterday, he was invited by Xiangyun to go to the Quan'an Teahouse to drink tea. Later, he heard that his colleagues had been arrested by the police station, so he went to the police station gate to inquire and was arrested. Yu Haiquan stated that he was a craftsman in the electric light company. After leaving work at 5:00 yesterday, he went to Quan'an to drink tea and was arrested by the Vietnamese police while passing by the Songshan Road police station. Cao Liang stated that he was a tap water worker. After going to Quan'an to drink tea at 5:00 PM yesterday, he heard that the workers had been arrested, so he went to the police station gate to watch and was arrested. Chen A'xue stated that he was also a worker in the electric light company. He was arrested while passing by the Songshan Road police station on his way home from work yesterday. The judge asked, "Is it your decision that the tram is not running today?" They all replied that they did not know. Zhao Jinsheng, Gao A'fu, and Chen Baobao stated together that they were blacksmiths in the Industrial Bureau's motor room. After receiving their wages at the Industrial Bureau yesterday afternoon, they went to the Quan'an Teahouse to shake a club because a new car had been arrested for no reason. Therefore, they went to the police station gate to watch and did not dare to cause trouble. They did not know the workers of the electric light company. The two lawyers, Jin Yu and Li Yuan, were also appointed to argue that the court had already inquired about the case and that the three defendants Zhao Jinsheng, Chen Baobao, and Gao A'fu were all eating tea at the Quan'an Teahouse. Others had committed the beating, so they requested that they be declared innocent. At this point, Judge Ge announced the end of the debate and issued a verdict in court. Zhu A'long was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for publicly gathering a crowd to obstruct official duties and two months of imprisonment for jointly injuring others, with a total sentence of seven months of imprisonment. Yu Haiquan was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for publicly gathering a crowd to obstruct official duties. Cao Liang and Chen A'xue were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment for publicly gathering a crowd to obstruct official duties. Zhao Jinsheng was sentenced to two months of imprisonment for jointly injuring others. Gao A'fu and Chen Baobao were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment for publicly obstructing official duties. The number of days of detention before the judgment was finalized was counted as two days for one day. Zhao Jinsheng, Gao A'fu, and Chen Baobao were all given a two-year suspended sentence and ordered to be released on bail at any time. If they could not provide bail, they would be detained.</p>
<p>▲ Letter Requesting Severe Punishment The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association learned from the villagers' report yesterday that the case was related to local security and that the situation was extremely serious. After the special commissioner investigated the matter thoroughly, an emergency meeting was convened to discuss methods to assist the victimized fellow villagers. As a result, in addition to comforting the victim Li Genfa, letters were sent to the Shanghai Second Special District District Court and the French Concession General Police Station, demanding that the culprits in this case be severely punished in accordance with the law to appease public anger.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Shanghai's Continuous Rain and Wind <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Water Accumulation Was Widespread Again</p>
<p>Rice, Grains, and Vegetables Were All Affected</p>
<p>This year, the amount of rainfall in this city is particularly high. Since the hurricane and heavy rain on the 26th of last month, water has accumulated everywhere, damaging walls, houses, and trees, almost leading to a rare disaster. Fortunately, after days and nights of wind and rain, the sky suddenly cleared. However, general transportation and power lines have been obstructed. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of this month, on the morning of the 4th, the sky was suddenly covered with dark clouds, and the north wind gradually increased. By the afternoon, the rain poured down again, and as of last night, it had not stopped for a single moment. Therefore, in the low-lying areas of the concession and the Chinese city, coupled with the inadequate drainage of the ditches, water has accumulated to a foot deep. The conditions in various places are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Conditions in the Concession Along the western roads of the Public Concession and the Rue Lafayette and Rue Bayle of the French Concession, pedestrians wearing rain boots could not pass easily. At the intersection of Route Saipoise and Avenue Joffre, the accumulated water was a foot deep, and vehicles splashed water everywhere as they passed. However, this rainfall was not as severe as the previous one, so many coolies temporarily earned money by carrying pedestrians on their backs.</p>
<p>▲ South City Submerged The Chinese city in the South City, after the heavy rain of the previous two days, was a vast expanse of water, turning into a swamp. Low-lying areas such as the Local Court, Huining Road, Guohuo Road, Xin Puyu Tang Road, Daxing Street, and Shangwen Road were all knee-deep in water. The Local Court was surrounded by water on all sides, and the lower-level staff inside the court were working barefoot. The water of the Huangpu River has reached the shore, and pedestrians are also wading through the water.</p>
<p>▲ Zhabei's Plight Due to the continuous heavy rain, low-lying areas in Zhabei, such as near the Meigen Road Station, behind the Jiajun Guild Hall, in front of the Xijin Public Office, and north of Datong Road and Gonghe Xin Road, open spaces have all become a vast expanse of water. Along the roads of Zhonghua Xin Road, Pusan Road, and Hu-Tai Road, the grass sheds are submerged in water to varying depths of one or two feet. Datong Road, from the Zhijiang Temple Road south to the Zhonghua Xin Road section, about half a mile long, has turned into a river. The grass sheds in the water, viewed from a distance, are no different from islands in the ocean. Thousands of impoverished people from Jiangbei live in the water every day, with no way to change their situation.</p>
<p>▲ Slight Increase in Rice Prices Rice merchants also temporarily suspended opening their bins due to the rain in the past two days. However, according to inquiries at various retail rice shops, the highest grade of white rice, which had previously fallen from 20 yuan to 17 yuan per picul, was sold yesterday at 17 yuan 8 jiao or 18 yuan per picul, exceeding the price limit by about one yuan. However, this grade of white rice is now stored in the inner rooms, and not all ordinary households can buy it. The commonly sold first and second grades of white rice are replaced with the second and third grades, respectively, and the price is increased. The recorded rice prices for yesterday are as follows: First-grade white rice (replaced by second-grade white rice) 17 yuan per picul, second-grade white rice (replaced by third-grade white rice) 16 yuan 4 jiao per picul, new japonica rice 16 yuan, bian yuan (glutinous rice) 15 yuan 6 jiao, foreign indica rice 16 yuan, mechanical indica rice 14 yuan 8 jiao, and guest indica rice 14 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Shortage of Vegetables Due to the continuous cloudy and rainy weather, most of the cotton, rice, vegetables, and other crops planted in the rural areas around this city have been damaged by flooding. The heavy rain poured down the night before last, without stopping all night, and the water level rose sharply. Although the various vegetables planted by nearby farmers were available on the market yesterday morning, the prices have doubled. The vegetables in various vegetable markets, such as cabbage, edamame, loofah, gai choy, chives, etc., were obstructed by the heavy rain. Although prices rose, goods were still scarce.</p>
<p>▲ Collapsed House Injured People The house at No. 130 Yanhai Road, Yunjie Street, inside the Old North Gate, is the property of the Silk Industry Association. Its rear wall facing the street, due to being soaked by wind and rain, suddenly collapsed at 1:20 PM yesterday. A woman named Chen Shen, who lived at No. 4 Yuchang Lane in Shizi Lane, happened to be passing by and was seriously injured in the head and right leg by the collapsed wall. A rickshaw puller named Yuan Zhilin happened to be passing by at the time and was also injured in the right leg, hip, and arm. The police officers arrived and immediately took the injured people to the Second District, First Branch Police Station, and then transferred them to Renji Hospital for treatment. The collapsed wall was more than two zhang long. Afterwards, the association called the Public Works Bureau and asked them to send workers to surround the remaining collapsed wall with wooden frames to prevent it from collapsing again and injuring people.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Jiangnan Embankment Works Office Seizes Time to Repair Seawalls <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Situation Is Mostly Free of Danger</p>
<p>Reports have been made in this newspaper about the dangerous situations and emergency repairs of the seawalls in Baoshan and Taicang counties. It is now learned that Director Xue Zhaoshu of the Jiangnan Embankment Works Office immediately rushed to block the breaches day and night after the dangerous situations occurred at Xuejiatan in Baoshan and Daotangmiao Wangjiazhai in Taicang. The progress was very fast. Yesterday, he accompanied the engineers and others to Daotangmiao Wangjiazhai in Taicang in the rain to direct everything. It is reported that the office has made proper arrangements for the preliminary emergency rescue project plan and implementation steps. It is also reported that the report submitted to the Provincial Construction Department and Water Conservancy Bureau is roughly as follows regarding the engineering aspects: (1) The dangerous works plan is to add hemp bags to the rammed earth and add stone outside. (2) The project personnel and administrative arrangements are as follows: Assistant Engineers Feng Dan and Mou Tongbo are stationed in Baoshan Xuejiatan to be responsible for the dangerous works in Baoshan. Zhang Tingnan and Zhang Bin are stationed in Taicang Daotangmiao to be responsible for the dangerous works in Taicang. (3) Material purchase situation: More than 1,000 pieces of local materials in Taicang have been transported, and 13,000 to 14,000 hemp bags have been transported. In addition, 200 cubic meters of Jiangyin stones have been purchased, and ten boats have arrived. In Baoshan, it is planned to purchase 4,000 pieces of wood first, and 1,000 pieces have been transported. It is planned to purchase 60,000 hemp bags first, and 10,000 have been transported. Another 10,000 can be transported today. (4) Material transportation situation: In Taicang, cars are used from Shanghai to Liuhe, and small carts are used from Liuhe to the construction site. During high tide, ships are used from Liuhe. In Baoshan, cars are used from Shanghai to Baoshan, and small carts are used from Baoshan to the construction site. During high tide, ships are used from the Sui Tang River. All must reach the construction site within two or three days. (5) Construction methods: The contracted price for ramming earth is stipulated to be 1 yuan 1 jiao to 2 jiao per cubic foot at the bottom, and 4 jiao 5 fen to 5 jiao per piece for the stone. Try to contract out at a reasonable price as much as possible. It is a fixed division of labor. In addition, there are one or two flying shifts for workers, which are mobile and specialize in sporadic projects (currently being organized). (6) Worker situation: There are 200 earthworkers and one shift of pile drivers in Taicang. Another shift can be added within one or two days. There are also about 200 earthworkers and two shifts of pile drivers in Baoshan. It is planned to increase the number of earthworkers by four or five hundred within two or three days. Negotiations have been completed. (7) Current status of the project: This project is arranged to start from the breaches and then the gaps, and then the secondary dangers. The breach at Daotangmiao Wangjiazhai in Taicang has been roughly 80% to 90% completed. The newly built embankment has passed the high tide level and is preparing to add pile drivers and stone construction workers. The breach at Xuejiatan in Baoshan is being done by earthworkers and stone workers at the same time and has been 50% completed. If the weather is fine for the above breach projects, it is expected that the work can be completed by the third day of the eighth lunar month. In addition, small breaches in Baoshan, such as Zhangjiazhai Niutou and Jing Wuyuedun, have also been recruited, and work will begin immediately. It is expected to be completed before the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month. It is also reported that Director Xue plans to go to Songjiang Jinshanwei to inspect and repair emergency projects after the workers and materials in Baoshan are sufficient.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Shanghai Tuberculosis Hospital's New Hospital Construction Plan <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Current Hospital Affairs Are Progressing Exceptionally Well</p>
<p>The New Hospital Site Is on Hongqiao Road</p>
<p>The Tuberculosis Sanatorium at No. 2 Great Western Road in this city was established in 1928 and was founded by Huang Hanzhi and Ding Fubao. Wu Zhihui, Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, and others are directors. German medical doctors Finashi, Ding Huikang, Huang Dinghu, Wu Zhengji, and others are the medical directors. Since its establishment, it has been highly praised by the community. It has now expanded to four hospitals with 50 single rooms. The first hospital of the hospital is the outpatient department and the X-ray department, which are open for a long time. Patients can come and have X-rays taken at any time during the consultation hours and pick up the results the day after tomorrow. This measure greatly facilitates the diagnosis of patients. The second hospital specializes in receiving patients with severe tuberculosis, so that they can be isolated from those with mild tuberculosis. It is equipped with a chemical laboratory. The hospital uses the erythrocyte sedimentation rate test to measure the prognosis of tuberculosis, the suitability of treatment, and the progress of the disease, which is extremely accurate. The third hospital specializes in receiving patients with mild tuberculosis and has a 10-foot-wide veranda for recumbent therapy. The fourth hospital is a new-style building. One wall is entirely a large window. When the sky is clear, it can be fully opened, and the bedroom is equivalent to a veranda. If the weather is bad, the windows can still be closed and the patient can lie down. Outside the window, there are fountains and waterfalls, and the flowers and trees are quiet and beautiful. There are also disinfection surgery and electrotherapy rooms, where lung surgeries such as rib resection, artificial pneumothorax, and phrenic nerve resection can be performed.</p>
<p>The new hospital plan of the hospital on Hongqiao Road is based on the rapid progress of the city and the original hospital site is insufficient. The site has been selected on the west side of Zhongshan Road on Hongqiao Road. The area is densely forested and the air is fresh, which is very suitable for suburban convalescence. The new hospital's design is completely based on the architecture of the Swiss White Mark Sanatorium, with a social hall, dining room, music library, rest room, Italian garden, rooftop solarium, and other facilities. The samples are being made and it is expected that they will be completed at the same time as the new municipal government building at the end of next year.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The Court Investigates the Murder Case of Xia's Servant <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>After Ling Xiangxiang, the sedan carrier of the famous doctor Xia Yingtang, was killed and burned to destroy the evidence, the local court discovered the case and has been paying unusual attention to it in recent days. Since the Xia family has strict rules, it has been determined that the deceased Ling Xiangxiang was not killed by outsiders. Therefore, the investigation has now begun, and it is expected that all employees will be severely interrogated by the court in order to find out the truth. As for Xia himself, the court will also interrogate him to determine responsibility.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Counterfeit Dutch Banknotes Discovered and Used <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Long Qing and Tang Mingzong Were Both Detained</p>
<p>Long Qing from Guangxi took 20 ten-yuan (gold yuan) Dutch banknotes from Java Bank to Dingyu Money Shop at No. 294 Zhejiang Road and Jiujiang Road at 7 PM the day before yesterday to exchange for 340 Shanghai silver dollars. After Chen Zhibin, the shop assistant, carefully examined the banknotes, he realized that they were all counterfeit. He reported it to Chinese detective Ye Yuming, who arrested Long. After questioning, he learned that there was an accomplice, Tang Mingzong, waiting at the entrance of Wing On Company. The detective then arrested Tang and took him to the Old Gate Police Station. After investigation, it was learned that they belonged to an organized group and that there was also a person named Feng who was the instigator. Feng first opened room 55 in the Great Eastern Hotel and then handed Long Qing the 20 counterfeit banknotes and a ship ticket from Java Shipping Company, ordering him to exchange them at Dingyu. His plan was that if others detected it, he could claim that the banknotes were brought by the Dutch and that he was exchanging them because he lacked travel expenses. At that time, he would also show the ship ticket to make people believe it. Unexpectedly, it was exposed. Yesterday morning, the police station sent the two criminals, Long and Tang, to the First Special District Court Criminal Division. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, prosecuted them for counterfeiting currency in accordance with Article 212 of the Criminal Law. Because the case still needs to be investigated, a postponement was requested. When questioned, Long Qing confessed that Feng had instructed him to do it, while Tang Mingzong confessed that he knew nothing about it. Judge Xu Jiazhanshi reviewed the confession and ordered the case to be adjourned for one week. The two defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>A Husband Demands Adultery Money and Is Detained - A Strange Tale</p>
<p>Jiang Asan, a Ningbo native, 36 years old, who lives in Rongsen Lane, Lane 2, Menggu Road, Zhabei, and runs a vegetable business, recently became entangled with a certain woman, secretly engaging in adultery more than once. Unexpectedly, joy turned to sorrow, and the matter was discovered by the woman's husband. At about 9 AM the day before yesterday, he led four or five hooligans to Jiang's house, claiming that Jiang had taken another man's wife and threatened to use force. At that time, a mediator came forward to mediate. The group initially wanted Jiang to pay 50 yuan to settle the matter, but Jiang was a poor man and had no such huge sum of money. After repeated requests, it was agreed that 10 yuan would be paid. Then, they left. Jiang immediately borrowed money from relatives and friends without success. In desperation, he thought of living together. Learning of this, he rushed to the rescue, but it was too late, and Jiang had died. At 1 PM, the woman's husband and a certain Jia came to Jiang's house to demand 10 yuan, but they were detained by the neighbors. They reported to the Fourth District Police Station, which ordered the police to arrest Jia and Yi and take them back to the police district, and ordered the local constable to report to the local court for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e134">The Story of How Wu Wang, a Woman From Baoying, Was Deceived <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Wu Wang, a woman from Baoying, is 43 years old and has a daughter named Fenzhu, who is 25 years old this year. In 1922, Wu arranged for her daughter to marry Li Shukun, a fellow villager, through a matchmaker. Li was engaged in the South Goods industry in Liyang. After Wu's daughter, Fenzhu, married into the family, the two sides could not reconcile their opinions, and there were often disputes. In February of this year, Fenzhu had another conflict with Li over a minor matter. At that time, she felt resentment and thought that her mother was working as a servant in the Song family in Suzhou. So, she went to Suzhou, intending to divorce Li. Unexpectedly, when she arrived at the Song family, her mother was out on business and she could not meet her. Then, she took a car to Shanghai and was introduced by her younger sister to work as a servant in the family of a certain surname in Anren Lane, Kangti Road, in the French Concession. Because the work of the employer was too heavy every day, she felt that she could not bear it. Thinking that if she quit, she would have nowhere to live. Just when she was in a dilemma, Zhao Zhang, a woman from Yixing whom she knew, came to her and said that she knew a man from Wuxi named Ding Aji, who was 29 years old this year and lived at No. 85 Meijia Lane in the South City. He was engaged in the mahjong business and had a wealthy family. He was now short of a wife and wanted to find someone suitable. If she was willing, Zhao could act as a matchmaker. Fenzhu was overjoyed when she heard this and asked Zhao to help her with the introduction. On April 11, Ding Aji welcomed Fenzhu to his home and lived together, and paid 30 yuan as a reward to Zhao Zhang. After Fenzhu entered Ding's house, she realized that Ding was also a poor man and realized that she had been deceived by Zhao Zhang. She was very frustrated, but since the matter was irreversible, she could only sigh at her bad luck. After learning that her daughter had gone to Suzhou and was not found, Wu Wang immediately rushed to Shanghai to search for her daughter's whereabouts, but she had no success. So, on July 4, she returned to Suzhou, resigned from her job as a servant, and came to Shanghai again. She was introduced to work as a servant in the family of a certain surname at No. 53 Qiaojia Shed. She took time to go out and look for Fenzhu, but after two months, there was still no news. Until the day before yesterday, Wu had an important matter and was passing near the Vulcan Temple inside the Great Eastern Gate. Suddenly, she met Fenzhu on the road. Mother and daughter were overjoyed after being separated for a long time. After talking, she learned the truth and felt angry. She immediately went to Kangti Road to arrest Zhao Zhang and took her to Meijia Lane in the South City, along with Ding Aji. She reported them to police officer Wei Jin, who was guarding the Fifth Post. The precinct chief, after a preliminary hearing, ordered that the case involved the abduction of a married woman and ordered that a written report be submitted to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Two Suicides <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Both Were Due to Difficult Livelihoods</p>
<p>▲ Wang Zhikui Wang Zhikui, a native of Suzhou, was 30 years old. He used to be in the foreign goods business but has now lost his job. At about 2 AM the day before yesterday (the 3rd), he went to the Nanjing Hotel in Hongyun Lane, next to the Nanking Theater on Edward Road. He was led to room 12 by the tea room attendant, paid two yuan for the room, and went to bed. Two hours later, there was a sudden groan from room 12. The tea room attendant knew that something was wrong and tried to pry open the door. He saw Wang lying on the bed, his face pale. He knew that he had taken poison. He quickly reported to the accounting room and called the Songshan Road Police Station, ordering the detective to come and hire a car to send him to Renji Hospital. He died at 9:30 AM. A white linen long shirt, a straw hat, a hairnet, a pair of white canvas shoes, three copper double-hao coins, a bottle of black liquid medicine, and a small amount of medicine were left in the room. A page of foreign paper was left on the table, but the handwriting was illegible. The content was roughly that he was being pressed by livelihood and could not survive. He was temporarily borrowing the hotel as a place to die. He hoped that they would forgive him for his audacity.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Agen Zhang Agen, 21 years old, a resident of No. 302 Chengdeli, Shanjia Garden, Baker Road, in the Public Concession, was a member of a military band. Recently, due to the sluggish business, his livelihood was difficult. In a moment of anger, he secretly took poison and committed suicide yesterday. Afterwards, the neighbors noticed and hired a car to send him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at about 1 PM the next afternoon. His body was sent by the hospital to the autopsy station to await a report to the court for inspection.</p>

<p>Inquiry from Mr. Gu Liangcun</p>
<p>It has been five or six years since I graduated from the rural normal school. Because my income is not much, my economic situation has become even more difficult this summer due to my marriage. In order to solve the economic problem, I have to try to further my studies. I have decided to enter law and politics or pattern making, but I am troubled by three things: diploma, tuition, and household expenses. (It is inconvenient to enter a cram school because I live in Pudong.) Can you tell me the best way to solve this problem?</p>
<p>(Reply) Since you have graduated from a rural normal school, you should first serve in a rural primary school for several years, and then fully prepare both your economic and academic abilities before seeking further education. This is reasonable. At this time, when funds are difficult, it is best to seek employment first. Regarding the issue of a qualifying diploma, there will be and should not be any special methods to solve it. Law and politics and architectural design, commonly known as pattern making, are different in nature and even more different from normal school. We believe that you should examine your own nature, talent, and environment, and identify one of these types. The best (easiest) way is to specialize in education, first work as a school teacher, accumulate some experience, and then pursue further education in the future. But this requires you to seriously consider and decide for yourself.</p>
<p>Inquiry from Mr. Zhi Ran</p>
<p>I am a child from a poor family and have received elementary school education. Now I cannot earn enough and there are still parents at home who are over sixty years old and cannot work, nor is there any progress. Needless to say, what will happen in the future, all current daily expenses are my responsibility. However, what I earn is only enough for my own use, how can I bear this huge burden? Therefore, I want to find a better job, but I do not have a suitable position. Please solve this problem in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) It is not easy for you to find a better job, because to do that kind of job, you must first acquire that kind of knowledge and skills. To put it another way, you must also accumulate a wealth of experience in that kind of job. The higher the salary, the more professional skills are needed. Therefore, to plan for you, it is best to stick to your current job in the store and think of a way to improve. For example, if you work in the accounting room, then study accounting; if you work in the sales department, then study retail. There are books that can be studied in your spare time. Improve step by step from self-study. Others don't understand, I understand. Others can't do it, I can do it. This is how you stand out. This is called upward progress in your own field. There are many famous successful people in Shanghai who came from this background. Do not change jobs easily. The Chinese Vocational Education Society on Huanlong Road has a correspondence school to help young people study on their own in their spare time. You can ask Mr. Jin Daoyi, who is in charge.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Grounded German Ship is Out of Danger <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Sailing to Nagasaki for Repairs</p>
<p>Heavy Losses of Ship and Cargo</p>
<p>The accident involving the German merchant ship Bachenland of the Heinrich Podeus &amp; Co has already been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that after the accident, the company immediately ordered the Ameland, which came from Europe to Shanghai, to rescue her. However, the ship is now out of danger and on her way to Japan, with heavy losses. The passengers were safely rescued. A follow-up report is provided below:</p>
<p>▲Two Cabins Flooded: This time, the Bachenland was carrying goods from Dagu, Qingdao, and other ports, and was heading to Kobe, Japan. When traveling on the sea near Korea, it hit a reef near Baojie Island. The bottoms of the first two cabins of the ship were punctured by the reef, and seawater flooded the two cabins, causing great damage to the goods. Fortunately, the cabins were separated by bulkheads, so the other cabins were not affected and the ship did not sink.</p>
<p>▲Passengers Rescued: After the ship accident, the Shanghai office was preparing to send a ship for rescue, and had negotiated with Jardine Matheson to send a tugboat, and ordered an employee to go along for inspection. Then, a telegram came to Shanghai from a Japanese ship, saying that after the Bachenland ran aground, the Dalian-bound postal ship Baikal Maru of the Osaka Company happened to pass by the area at around 7 PM and went to help. Twenty-five Western passengers on the German ship who were on a trip to North China and East Asia were quite frightened after the accident. They lowered the lifeboats of the Baikal Maru and rescued the twenty-five passengers, sending them to Kobe, and then taking another ship back to Shanghai. The travel expenses were paid by the Heinrich Podeus &amp; Co.</p>
<p>▲Self-Rescue: Yesterday morning, the Shanghai office received a telegram from the Japanese branch, saying that after the Bachenland ran aground, fortunately the wind was calm. At around 11 PM that night, the shipowner Mr. Duniak tried every possible means and pulled the ship off the reef by himself. After temporarily plugging the holes in the bottom of the cabin, he immediately sailed to Nagasaki that night to unload the cargo from the first and second cabins and repair the ship in Japan.</p>
<p>▲Postponement of Export: The damage to the ship's hull and the water damage to the cargo will be evaluated after the ship returns to Germany. Now, the ship is being temporarily repaired in Japan. The ship was originally scheduled to come to Shanghai on the 11th to load more cargo for export. Now, because it is impossible, all customers have been notified that the departure date to Germany must be postponed.</p>

<p>Five Passengers Rescued Yesterday</p>
<p>The Zhaoxing ship of the Zhaoxing Company, coming from Yingkou to Shanghai, ran aground due to avoiding wind in the Shidao Bay of Qingshantou, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the ship cannot be rescued for the time being. The company has asked the Japanese Salvage Company for help. The accurate information obtained yesterday is detailed below:</p>
<p>▲Front Cabin Damaged: The location of the Zhaoxing ship accident is at 122 degrees, 29 minutes, and 22 seconds east longitude, and 34 degrees, 55 minutes, and 10 seconds north latitude. After Zhang Jidan opened the ship away from the Shidao Reef, it ran aground on the beach along the coast. The bottom of the ship's bow was heavily damaged by the collision, and the hole was large. Seawater flooded the cabin, and the bow sank to the bottom of the sea, which may affect the entire ship. According to a telegram from the shipowner yesterday, part of the barrel oil loaded on the deck has been thrown into the sea to reduce the draft. The bow cabin is also being unloaded.</p>
<p>▲Ships Helping with Rescue: The Rongxing ship has already started helping the Zhaoxing at the accident site, unloading the cargo from the first and second cabins to drain the accumulated water from the cabins. The Hexing ship, carrying cement and other materials for repairing the bottom of the ship, has also arrived from Yingkou. After the cargo is cleared, the holes will be plugged. The Qingdao Northeast Fleet has also sent a warship to protect the ship.</p>
<p>▲Passengers Rescued to Shanghai: Five passengers from Niuzhuang were traveling to Shanghai on the Zhaoxing ship and were very anxious at the time. Later, the company telegraphed the Yuxing ship on the way to Shidao to rescue the five passengers from the Zhaoxing ship and send them to Shanghai. They arrived in Shanghai at 9 AM yesterday and landed at the Longmao pier in Pudong.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Ship Tows: Yesterday, the company agreed to ask the Tokyo Salvage Company of Japan to send a ship to the accident site to tow the Zhaoxing ship out of the shallows. Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai office invited staff from Mitsui &amp; Co., the Shanghai agent, to the Zhaoxing Company to negotiate the towing procedures and inform them of all the details of the accident.</p>

<p>To be Dealt with According to Law if Defied</p>
<p>The Municipal Government recently received reports that steamer waiters are extorting, harassing, and making things difficult for disaster victims coming to Shanghai by boat every month. Yesterday, a special order was issued to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that, according to reports, steamer waiters are extorting, harassing, and making things difficult for disaster victims coming to Shanghai by boat. Upon hearing this, we are deeply angered. Considering that the victims of this disaster have been displaced and their homes have been destroyed, and that they have nothing left, anyone with a conscience should be providing relief, let alone exploiting them again. Therefore, we hereby order you to quickly instruct all steamer companies, and to forward this to the respective labor unions, to earnestly warn all waiters under their jurisdiction that they must not demand anything from disaster victims seeking refuge in the future. Those who dare to disobey will be dealt with according to the law to uphold humanity and benefit the victims. This is the order. After receiving the order, the Social Affairs Bureau sent letters to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Shanghai Shipping Trade Union, stating that it is reasonable to make every effort to protect the disaster victims from all provinces coming to Shanghai. However, according to reports from disaster victims from Jiujiang, Hankou, and other places, such as Laoyang Bai and Li Zuomei, who came to the bureau one after another, the waiters on the boat demanded all kinds of things from them, not only taking away all of their meager living expenses, but even stripping them of their clothes, leaving them hungry and naked, and requesting relief. After reviewing the above statements, although they may not be entirely credible, the unanimous voices suggest that they are not fabricated. This kind of brutal act is not only unscrupulous and unreasonable, but also a cause for concern for the morality and the hearts of the people. Therefore, we hereby request you to investigate and instruct your subordinates to comply accordingly. If there are any who persist in evil, they will be severely punished and will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>Effective Protection by Maritime Police</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Guangli ship, on its way from Shanghai to Fujian last time, encountered a hurricane when traveling to Shantou, Wenzhou. Because it was difficult to sail, she had to stop and anchor a few feet away from the mountain in the sea to avoid the wind. Unexpectedly, the storm became more violent and extremely dangerous. Suddenly, dozens of bandits from the mountain came in more than a dozen boats and boarded the ship to rob. Fortunately, the escort police team on the Guangli ship was prepared and immediately opened fire. The bandits knew that it was difficult to resist and fled in different directions. The maritime police were brave and effective, and all the passengers on the ship were safe and avoided robbery. It was a lucky thing. It is also heard that the Guangli waited there for three hours before the wind gradually subsided and the ship sailed, arriving safely in Minyuan on the 27th of last month.</p>

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor: Upon reviewing the section concerning the public memorial for Dean Tan published in your esteemed newspaper on the 4th of this month, the original text of the elegiac couplet sent by our department, "Building tombs resembles the Qilian Mountains, together we admire the mourning and glorify the red land," was erroneously printed as "together we admire the mourning and glorify the red shadow," which is quite incomprehensible. Therefore, we respectfully request a correction. Your kind attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, The General Affairs Office of the Songhu Garrison Command. September 5th.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of Shen Bao: Having read the news about the public bus strike in your esteemed newspaper, it stated, "All the ticket sellers sent five responsible representatives to the Water and Electricity Workers' Union the night before, requesting the standing director of the union to go to the Social Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Party Committee to request assistance and mediation," which is quite inconsistent with the facts. Our colleagues announced the strike because the drivers could not act in unison. Although the situation remains as isolated as before, and the attitude of the management remains as tough as before, our colleagues deeply believe in our own strength and know that the only way to achieve victory is to persist together. As for going to the Water and Electricity Workers' Union the night before to request assistance from the standing director of the union, it was the action of only three or five individuals and does not represent the opinion of the whole. The general assembly did not make such a resolution, nor did the strike committee make this decision, and no responsible representatives were sent for negotiations. This matter is of great importance. We hope that you will make a correction. Respectfully, The Shanghai British Public Bus Workers' Strike Committee. September 5th.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Easy to Kill, Difficult to Give Birth <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Before a human life, there are parents; before parents, there are ancestors. Since the discovery of life on the Earth's crust eighty million years ago, it took seventy-six million years for mammals to appear, and then another three and a half million to five hundred thousand years for human form to emerge, enduring countless hardships. Having taken human form, countless more hardships from wild beasts, diseases, floods, droughts, and wars had to be endured for generations to survive and pass down to me. The brothers and sisters who were conceived at the same time as me numbered no less than a million, but only I was fortunate enough to enter the gate of life. If I had been born to an unwed mother, she could have aborted me, or thrown me into the river to drown after birth, or sent me to a foundling hospital, resulting in a living being entering and a dead one emerging. If I had been born into a poor family, hunger, cold, and illness would have been unavoidable, and in the event of natural or man-made disasters, children would have been exchanged for food. If I had been born into a wealthy family, then in warmth and satiety, I would have indulged in pleasure and died in comfort. If I had been born and lost my mother, or encountered a stepmother, then I would have been whipped and beaten day and night, how could I have survived? If I had been abducted by kidnappers, the girls would have been sold into brothels, and the boys would have been cut up and sold as meat-filled buns. If I had been born in a country without child labor protection, then machines would have been tigers devouring children. As for one difficulty after another, still able to progress from elementary school to middle school, there are only two or three hundred thousand out of four hundred million people. What are these two or three hundred thousand youths? They are the essence naturally selected over eight hundred thousand years. Now, the tens of thousands who are successful will sooner or later die in decadence; the tens of thousands who are unsuccessful will sooner or later die by the axe. How many are left? How difficult it is to give birth! How easy it is to kill!</p>
<h3 id="e168">Exchanging Paintings for Crabs by Qing Daoren <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>A prominent figure in Shanghai. Recently, the former disciples of Zeng and Li have organized to publish the works of both teachers. Which is a great thing. I recall that Qing Daoren was addicted to crabs, earning the title of "Li's Hundred Crabs." At that time, Daoren lived in Shanghai. The autumn wind was strong, and the purple crabs were freshly fattened. He wanted to feast, but his purse was empty. Helpless, he painted a hundred small crab paintings to satisfy his craving. The crabs were all painted in ink, without any color, yet the flavor was rich, a stroke of divine inspiration. His friend Feng Qiubai saw it and greatly appreciated it. He went to Suzhou to buy three large baskets of Yangcheng Lake golden-haired, round-bellied crabs as an exchange for the paintings. Qing Daoren was delighted to get the crabs and generously gave him all one hundred paintings. Qiubai then named his study "Hundred Crabs Studio" to show his appreciation. I heard that Qiubai crossed the sea to Taiwan last year to do business. I don't know if he brought these hundred crab paintings with him to a foreign land. Otherwise, they could be used to make engravings. Qing Daoren is known for his calligraphy, and painting is only a secondary pursuit. Years ago, the owner of Xinhange met Mr. Weng Yinruo, a famous calligrapher and painter, at an antique shop on Hulong Street in Wuzhong and saw one of Qing Daoren's short paintings. Yinruo praised it as a masterpiece. The owner of Xinhange exchanged it for five yuan and made it into a seven-character couplet. (Gao Bu Zheng Qi Han Wei Guo, Qi Wen He Yi Cai Zhonglang.) There was a title on the top (Jiyun.) The owner was not happy. He suddenly thought that my name was Jiyun, and gave me the couplet as a gift, saying, "Your name is Jiyun. This couplet must be written by you." I still hang it in my paper-screened, bronze-bottled room, longing for Yanyun, and am very grateful for the generous gift from the owner.</p>

<p>Unbreakable Glass: Westerners have a superstition that breaking glass brings seven years of bad luck. For many years, scientists have been trying to invent unbreakable glass. Recently, two young scientists at the Californian Institute of Technology in the United States have succeeded in inventing it. However, the manufacturing method is still kept secret. In Europe, a type of soft glass has also been made, mostly from vegetables. It looks just like real glass, but can be rolled up like paper and will not break if thrown or twisted.</p>
<p>▲Rewards for Cars Without Accidents In major cities around the world, cars are as numerous as clouds. Accidents and injuries are common. The Vienna Automobile Club in the Austrian capital, Vienna, has prepared many kinds of medals that can be attached to buttons or inserted on cars to reward general car drivers. The medals are also divided into grades. Those who have never had an accident or been fined in fifteen years get the first grade; ten years get the second grade; and five years get the third grade. People with cars generally feel honored to receive this award. (Overseas Guest)</p>

<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>The Shu province is located in the remote western frontier. Its mountains and rivers are dangerous and difficult. It is known as a land of silkworms. It has the danger of the Qutang Gorge in the east, the obstruction of the Jian Ge plank road in the north, borders Guizhou and Yunnan to the south, and connects to Kang and Tibet to the west. It is rich in products. The mountains are overlapping. It is indeed an area of four platforms, the country of heaven. Since history, it has been the place for heroes to establish dominance. By the end of the Qing Dynasty, the Sichuan Road Incident triggered the revolution, and the Qing Dynasty was overthrown. Zhao Erfeng and Duan Fang were both killed by the Sichuan people. When Xiangcheng was in power, he sent Wu Guangxin and Chen Huan to Sichuan one after another. Both failed and returned. Until now, it is still a situation of warlords occupying the land. The ancients said that the road to Shu is difficult, as difficult as ascending to the blue sky. I say that the governance of Shu is difficult, as difficult as ascending to the blue sky. Yesterday, at a friend's house, there was a guest who had returned from Chengdu. I inquired about the inside story of the Shu province. The guest sighed and said, "Bashu is a land beyond civilization. West of Yichang, as far as Chongqing, is Liu Xiang's territory. Chengdu is Liu Wenhui's sphere of influence. Northern Sichuan is Deng Xihou's base. Therefore, those of us who travel to Sichuan Province must pay taxes several times. In the autumn of the year before last, I passed through Wanxian. The inspection was extremely strict. I accidentally found two pairs of silk stockings in my suitcase. They wanted to levy taxes. I said that people cannot only prepare one pair of silk stockings. They must be able to change them. The inspector said angrily, 'Stockings can be bought in Sichuan. Why prepare two pairs? According to the law, taxes must be levied.' I had to pay it. The severity of the tax can be known. Until now, ironware and other items are strictly prohibited. It is said that iron is the raw material for manufacturing internal disturbances. The prohibition of iron is to curb the bud of chaos. All those who have a brigade or regiment of soldiers in Shu have more power than a king sitting on the south-facing throne. However, although Shu is divided into four, when foreign forces invade, they will quickly unite to resist foreign aggression, and they will shout the words '(the province is in danger)' to each other. Their spirit is no less than that of the Japanese in the east. Therefore, since the Republic of China, all those who have entered Shu have failed and returned. After the foreign forces have left, they will fight each other to compete for power. However, Yang Sen was quite knowledgeable in construction before he lost power. Today, the Chengdu Avenue is backed by mountains and faces the river. It is smooth and flat, and the scenery is beautiful, making people linger."</p>
<h3 id="e171">Memories of the Flood Relief <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>The flood in our country this time has spread to sixteen provinces. The suffering is severe. Newspapers have repeatedly reported it. There is no need to list them. However, the arrival of the flood is unpredictable. Even European countries that usually study flood prevention may not be able to completely avoid the disaster. Recently, in March of last year, a huge flood in southern France caused a disaster. The flooded area was as many as thirteen districts. At that time, the French president heard the news and personally went to the disaster area to express condolences and provide relief. The situation is the same as the current visit and inspection of Wuhan by Chairman Chiang. Now I will excerpt and translate some of the reports from European newspapers last year, so as to see the enthusiasm of the people in that country in rescue and protection. It may not be unhelpful as a lesson.</p>
<p>The rivers in southern France connect to the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. In late February of last year, there was continuous rain. The speed of the water flow was like a galloping horse. In an instant, both banks rose sharply. The accumulated water was as deep as eight feet. According to residents of Moscow, the water rose to the second floor in just five minutes. At this time, the wireless stations in each district reported the flood. When the news spread to Paris, all the residents of the city were panicked and looked like a major disaster was imminent.</p>
<p>The people of France, in the midst of this turbulent wave, were also admirable for their relief measures. Within three days, all the Mather boats and paddle wheels near Batu, whether official or private, joined the rescue and relief of the disaster victims. In each district, there were about thousands of ships. The Paris Chamber of Commerce held an emergency meeting. In one day and night, the food and cash relief received from various places reached more than 50 million francs. The assistance from other cities was not included. It is estimated that the flood in France was largely restored to order in four weeks. The spirit of self-help is commendable. Now the flood in our country is waiting for relief. It is urgent. Saving people is to save ourselves. It is hoped that all sectors will actively donate.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Record of the Eight Section Exercise of Shaolin <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xufan</p>
<p>The origin of boxing arts began at Shaolin Temple on Mount Song. It is said that during the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang, Dharma came east and resided on Mount Song, inventing the Yijin Jing and various sets of combat and legwork. Later, the best monks of the temple obtained his true teachings, passing them down through generations, establishing the Shaolin School and being regarded as its ancestor. His skills were superior to ancient animal arts. During the Song Dynasty, Emperor Zhao Kuangyin, the Great Ancestor, studied and comprehended these skills, advocating the teaching of combat arts, and thus there were classifications such as the Changquan School, the Chaquan School, the Hongquan School, the Huaquan School, and the Paoquan School. However, each had a set of Eight Section Exercise, each with different functions, capable of defeating enemies and beneficial for health. Therefore, Shaolin is the source of boxing arts, akin to the source of a river. Li Jixun of our Wu region is young and handsome, skilled in combat. In his childhood, he was taught by Ma Yushan, a judge of the Central Guoshu Institute, excelling in Shaolin Chaquan, and has long been renowned both north and south, a strong combat expert. Li entered the hall and chamber, and was well-educated, progressing so rapidly that he surpassed his master. Recently, he was hired by a school in this port. Some days ago, comrades welcomed him at Yepu Garden. After the wine was flowing, Li, at the request of his comrades, demonstrated a set of Shaolin Twenty-Four Histories, consisting of one hundred and eight moves, quite splendid. In the five aspects of hand, eye, body, footwork, he was thorough in all respects. His performance was accompanied by whizzing sounds. He then performed a set of Eight Section Exercise, which was particularly distinctive. Between his arm bones and joints, there were cracking sounds. His skin was as hard as iron. From beginning to end, he was invulnerable. I am an outsider, only seeing him as lively as a monkey, leaping into the air, not daring to add my own judgment. According to an expert, this Chaquan Eight Section Exercise has more and more difficult movements than other boxing arts. If one is not well-trained and profound, how can one reach this level of divinity? He can be said to be a rising star.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Casual Talks from the Di Xiang Zhai Studio <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>I once wrote Casual Talks from the Di Xiang Zhai Studio. My friend Shou Juan once published it in a bi-monthly magazine. Those who wanted to speak only revealed the tip of the iceberg. When I lived in the government office and was a Beijing official, I did not write for more than ten years. Now that I am at sea, Shou Juan asked me about it. I said, "Now is the time." So I continued to write it.</p>
<p>Rao Hanxiang</p>
<p>Some say that Rao Hanxiang was a disciple of Fan Zengxiang. After the Republic of China was established, he was hired by Li Yuanhong as the secretary of the E Military Government and the Minister of Civil Affairs. This has not been verified. Hanxiang was from Guangji, Hubei, not a disciple of Yunmen. Elderly figures in Hubei, such as Yang Xingwu (Shoujing), were superior to Yunmen in both learning and morality. There were many who were his teachers. Why must Hubei people be from Yunmen's lineage to have fame and reputation? This is not entirely true. When Hanxiang was not successful, he listened to the drums in Fujian as a salt commissioner, feeling depressed and frustrated. Yao Wenzhuo, the academic commissioner, read his poems and prose and was impressed, so he invited him to his home to teach his children. Because it did not freeze during the winter, Zhai Zhaoyan (Yueshan), the military commander in Hanhang, recommended him to a certain historiographer. Shan ordered him to draft a few official documents to determine his worth. Xiang completed it overnight. Shan laughed coldly after seeing the draft and said, "Is this enough to be my subordinate?" He was not hired. Xiang sighed when he heard the news. In the autumn of the Xinhai year, Huangpi established his teeth in Wuchang, first taking the recruitment of talent as a matter of utmost importance. At that time, many renowned scholars and celebrities gathered upon hearing the news. Xiang was then a clerk in the Department of Finance. He drafted a document, and the director threw it on the ground. Xiang could not bear it and wanted to leave. A certain elderly figure admired his talent and said to Huangpi, "At the beginning of the Republic, talent is hard to find. There is someone in Hubei like Lu Jingyu who is being wronged as a low-level official. He does not seek to be known, and people rarely know him. Why don't you recruit him for your own use? It is like Jin Gong to Changli." Huangpi was overjoyed and invited him into his tent with courtesy. Xiang often read the Xuan Gong Collection. The official documents he wrote were imitated and somewhat similar. Huangpi repeatedly drafted lengthy articles and sent them by telegram to the world. They were poignant and touching, and resonated with people. They were all things that the people of the world wanted to say but dared not say. As a result, the minds of the people of the country unconsciously turned to the area between the Yangtze and Han rivers. Huangpi's reputation gradually increased. Xiang was made the leader of his staff and recommended as the Director of Internal Affairs, and then promoted to Governor. Later, Huangpi was lured into the capital by Xiangcheng, staying in Xiaopenglai. Xiang also retired in frustration, only getting the name of Senator. When Huangpi was enthroned in the White House, Xiang was in charge of the Second Secretariat. After its director, Ding Foyan (Shiyi), left, he took over. He offended Huangpi with something. When Huangpi rose again, Xiang was unemployed. Jin Yongyan occasionally mentioned his poverty, saying that most of his old friends were high-ranking officials. Why does Jifeng not think of Miser Monk? Miser Monk was Xiang's courtesy name. Huangpi was moved and wrote the four characters "help manage the secretary" and showed them to Yongyan. Yongyan told Xiang about it. Xiang hurriedly went to see him. Huangpi refused because of illness. He insisted on asking to see him and finally got to see him. Xiang sobbed and said, "My parents gave me life, and the President kept me alive. Although the help is occasional and scattered, it is still inexhaustible." Huangpi smiled and said, "You have suffered with me for a long time. You were not involved in confidential matters. I know my mistake. You can wait." In less than three days, the order of the Secretary-General was issued. Huangpi said to Ha Hanzhang, "Did I want to wrong Miser Monk? I just wanted to blunt his sharp edge." Hu Jun Chaozong once told me the whole story. Chaozong was from Huangpi and served Huangpi with Xiang. His words should be credible. In the year of Yichou, Guo Songling's rebellion nearly killed Xiang. He said to others, "Songling once knelt down and begged him to draft an edict to condemn Zhang. I politely declined. Ling said angrily, 'How do you know that I will not be the head of state one day?' His words were sharp and satirical. I know his meaning. I joined the army in anger, not as fortunate as Lin Changmin." A year after Ling's rebellion, it was rumored that Zhang Hanqing (Xueliang) ordered his arrest. There was no such thing. Xiang was afraid and wrote a letter to Xueliang to clarify the falsehood, nearly ten thousand words. Zhang replied with a letter of comfort, also several thousand words. I made the draft by hand. Alas, those who are talented and frustrated should not worry themselves by looking at Hanxiang.</p>

<p>(But, at this time, we lock the gate!) The gatekeeper was hesitant. He knew that it was inappropriate to keep her outside the gate, but not locking the gate would hinder his duties.</p>
<p>(You just lock it. I'll wait for our master to come back.) Madam Li was a little angry.</p>
<p>She thought: Mr. Li is the head of the family, and everyone should wait for him.</p>
<p>(But, the alley gate should be locked at this time, Madam Li!) Because Madam Li gave the most rewards to each family in the neighborhood during the festival, the gatekeeper did not dare to be too negligent. He was still hesitant and told her the reason for locking the gate.</p>
<p>(Then wait a moment. Look, isn't there a rickshaw coming slowly over there? Maybe he's coming back.) She stared infatuatedly at the east. On the white, vast road, there seemed to be the shadow of a rickshaw. She was very happy, very eager, and unhesitatingly determined that the person in the rickshaw must be Mr. Li. But she was disappointed, and the gatekeeper was also disappointed. The rickshaw slowly, slowly, very slowly pulled to the entrance of the alley: but it didn't stop, it still pulled forward.</p>
<p>(What do you think? Mr. Li won't be back until three o'clock at the earliest. I've been opening the gate for a month now. It's windy and snowy outside, Madam Li, you should go back! I'll wait for you. When Mr. Li comes back, I'll accompany him to your front door. Don't worry! Let me lock the gate first, and then send Madam Li home, okay?) The gatekeeper asked Madam Li in half Shanghai dialect.</p>
<p>(No, just lock the gate! You go and sleep in the wooden shed. I'll wait here. When he comes back, I can call you to unlock the lock.)</p>
<p>(It's better to wait at home. Be careful not to catch a cold, Madam Li!) The gatekeeper said this, but he was already very impatient. He really pulled the iron gate shut and locked it.</p>
<p>She stood outside the iron gate, shivering and trembling, still staring infatuatedly at the distant and blurred eastern road, wondering if there were any figures or cars coming.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Financial Gold Prices Return to Lower Levels <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>▲Fell Six Taels Seven Yesterday, the benchmark gold price fell back, with a large fluctuation. From morning to noon, there were more than seven taels of reversals, which had broken through the 770 tael mark, but the result was a decline of more than six taels, due to the influence of the silver price conference. People are extremely panicked, but because the silver market has not changed, it opened slightly higher. After that, sellers rushed in and turned sharply lower, almost like a river flowing downhill. There were only one or two taels of reversals. As for foreign exchange, it seemed to be slightly looser, but at noon it fell to the border of 70 taels. The market is closed as usual on Saturday. Since the beginning of this week, the market has been quite strong, once breaking through the 80 tael mark, reaching 85 taels and eight cents. Afterwards, it hovered at a low peak, and finally reached 70 taels and two cents, a difference of 15 taels and six cents. The total decline compared to the end of last week was 11 taels and eight cents. There is likely to be a transformation in the future.</p>
<p>▲Opening Slightly Better This morning, the October opening was slightly higher by six cents, at 777 taels and five cents. There were no changes in the major news and the public or private telegrams regarding silver prices. US stocks fell slightly, but reports said that the International Silver Conference would be convened on September 17, which caused excitement. Generally, large accounts tend to sell, such as Yuanmao, Zhifeng, Yongbingxing, etc., causing the price to drop by more than one tael to 76 taels and one cent. Then it rose by a few cents to 7 taels. When the British gold announcement showed no change, it was 76 taels and three cents, but Yongfeng, Yuancheng, Yongtianfeng, Yongyiyu, etc. agreed to sell, and then dropped by two taels and a few cents, and at 10 o'clock it was 74 taels and two cents. Then, because the Japanese Bank absorbed the October British gold at 875, it rose by one tael to 75 taels and a half. Unexpectedly, Dayu, Yuancheng, Yongyuanchun, Qianchangxiang, Yu Da and others tried hard to sell, because the draft was becoming smaller and smaller, and the forward British gold was difficult to sell at 9375. Then Mitsui sold it to Da Ying etc. at 9375, so the gold price plummeted. At 11 o'clock, it was only 70 taels and six cents. At this time, Tong Taichang, Run Changyu, Wan Xing Shunli and others entered the market, and the Zhengjin etc. ate the October and November British gold at 9375, so the price was pulled up by two taels to 72 taels and seven cents, but then it fell again. There was a reversal of one tael. At 11:30, Shuifeng etc. still had sales, and the printing exchange was close to small, distant to large, only with a number of one anna. At 11:45, it fell to 70 taels and seven cents. Guangbang slightly increased, picking up two, for 71 taels, six cents. But the people were unsettled, and most retail longs had sell-offs, so the price was difficult to stabilize. By noon, the closing was only 70 taels and two cents, a decrease of six taels and seven cents compared to the previous day. After the close, it fell again by a few cents. Xinhang etc. sold off, and finally saw 69 taels, eight cents, nine cents. According to half a day, the biggest opening was 7 taels and a half, and the smallest closing was zero cents, a difference of 7 taels, three cents. The opening price is still 810 taels and six cents, a discount of thirty-four or five taels to forty taels, and a registration of sixty-seven taels to seventy taels, and a water supplement of sixty-seven or seventy taels. ▲The current price plus seven taels and a half, the opening and closing are the same as the Bund. The spot red bars are sold by various traders to Yingfeng Hengtong Fengyong for hundreds of taels, and the price is added with seven taels and a half.</p>
<p>▲More Supply Than Demand The statistics of surface transactions show that Yuanmao Yong, Da Decheng, Bingxing, Hengxing, Tong Taichang, Run Changyu, Yuan Xingyu, Tian Fengyong, Yuan Cheng Yong, Xinheng, Yu Da, Yuan Chun, and Yu Taiheng are all selling positions. Yuan Tai, Huixiang, Sen Changyong, Chun Yuan Yong, Wan Xing, Shunli, etc. have entered recently, seeming lively. The physical top has been added to. Dalian Bang has sold 800 bars and entered more than 900 bars. Guangbang has entered 300 or 400 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Large Silver Bars See Price Increases Near and Far <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>

<h3 id="e177">Foreign Exchange Rates Tend Towards Easing <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no changes in the British and American silver markets. Exchange rates saw a decrease. European markets were stable, but the Shanghai HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged. Only the Hong Kong exchange rate decreased by 0.125, to 80.025 taels. This was likely bank trading, and the price seems to be trending towards easing due to the renewed weakness in the gold market. News that international banks will convene a conference of various countries to discuss silver prices and prevent further declines has stirred up sentiment, and market conditions have also been affected. Some Chinese gold firms have been selling, reportedly for hedging purposes. The volume of British gold traded exceeded 100,000 pounds, but Japanese banks showed little interest. A small amount of American gold was sold, and only several hundred thousand yuan of Japanese gold was sold, due to Saturday's typically low trading volume. Major players seem to expect further increases.</p>
<p>▲The British exchange rate for internal trading only turned over at 0.0625. Bids for September were 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 75, 8125 for October, and 875 for November and December. Buying prices were increased by 0.0625. The Bank of Taiwan, Zhengjin, Mitsui, and Sumitomo bought 875 for October and November. China-Italy bought 875 for October. Mitsui sold to the British Bank of Taiwan 9375 for December. Thus, the gold price fell to slightly above 70 taels, then Zhengjin, Chase, Sumitomo, and others bought 9375 for November, recovering to 72 taels. Surprisingly, the market still tended towards easing at noon. At the close, bids for near-term were 8125, and 9375 for the far-term. Buying prices were 875 to 3 pence.</p>
<p>▲The American exchange rate for internal trading fluctuated by 0.125. Bids in the morning were 29.875 to 30.0125 yuan, and buying prices were 30.00 to 30.01875 yuan. Bank of China bid, and Mitsui entered for 30 yuan in October. At the noon close, bids were 30 yuan for September, 30.0125 yuan for October, and 30.01875 yuan for November and December. Buying prices were all increased by 0.125.</p>
<p>▲The Eastern exchange rate for internal trading varied by half a cent during the half-day. Bids in the early market were 1 tael, 6 mace, 5 fen to 1 tael, 6 mace, 4 fen, 7.5 li, and buying prices were 1 tael, 6 mace, 4 fen, 5 li to 4 fen, 2.5 li.

<p>Silver Dollar Clearing Simplified Due to Weekend</p>
<p>Yesterday's silver dollar clearing activity was simplified due to it being Saturday, with banks closing in the afternoon. However, trading activity in the market was also quite sparse. The copper cash rate, however, rose unexpectedly. The early market was 7 mace, 2 fen, 5 li. In the afternoon, it suddenly increased by 3.75, to 7 mace, 2 fen, 5 li, 3 hao, 7.5 si. Silver borrowing rates remained weak. The early market was 8%, and the afternoon market was 6%. Bank posted rates remained unchanged. The additional handling fee for remittances remained unchanged. The amount of foreign exchange drafts made in the early market was 1.68 million, and 880,000 in the afternoon. Only 15,000 in banknotes in the afternoon. Off-market banknotes were 145,000 in the early market and 60,000 in the afternoon. Bank trading remained relatively strong, with interbank trading reaching 1.05 million in the early market and 900,000 in the afternoon.

The market price of jiao silver dollars unanimously rose, with the situation becoming quite tense. Copper coins were changed to 700 wen higher, to 3,700 wen, with over 31,000 strings traded.</p>

<p>The Trend is Increasingly Stagnant with 14.5 Million Traded</p>
<p>Yesterday's government bond market saw spot trading only in the Reorganization bonds, with 2,000 yuan traded in the after-market. No other bonds were traded. Futures trading remained active, but the trend of bond prices showed that the market environment was chaotic, and large-scale trading was less frequent than before. The market was dominated by retail investors and arbitrage trading, resulting in a more balanced supply and demand situation and a more stagnant price movement than before. Throughout the day, only the Salt Tax and Consolidated Tax bonds showed some strength in the early market, while other bonds fluctuated by only a few jiao. As a result, compared to the previous day, some bonds rose and others fell, with most changes being only one or two jiao. Futures trading totaled 10.06 million in the morning and 3.8 million in the after-market, for a total of 14.5 million yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending weaker, and the decline is intensifying. The situation in overseas cotton yarn markets is consistently trending downwards, and the severe floods in all parts of China have caused a significant slowdown in sales, leading to increasing pessimism. Many small players are closing out positions, triggering the decline. However, most of the large bullish players remain unmoved. Most of the market is in a short position, but some large merchants are cautiously covering their positions, and the future situation is uncertain.</p>
<p>▲Man-made yarn futures decline by one to two taels. In the early market, buyers were scarce, and the market situation suddenly changed, with prices for all months falling by 0.2 to 0.5 taels. In the afternoon, rumors were rampant, and prices for all months fell by another 0.3 to 0.6 taels. Total trading volume was 41,700 bales. The sellers included Gengfeng (1,450 bales), Tianlong (2,450 bales), Yuanfeng (1,700 bales), Rongxing (950 bales), Heshen (1,100 bales), and Gongtai (750 bales). The buyers included Meiji (1,050 bales), Ruida (1,250 bales), Yichang (1,750 bales), Yiyu (1,800 bales), and Taichang (1,150 bales). The closing prices are recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Cotton Market Declines <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending downwards due to continued declines in American cotton prices, easing gold prices, and persistent rain and wind in Shanghai, causing significant damage to cotton fields. However, the global cotton market is weak, and pressure from major players is increasing, making it difficult for the market to rise. However, most cotton merchants expect a poor harvest in China and are mostly in a bullish position. Therefore, based on the overall situation, both bullish and bearish sides have considerable strength, and the future situation is unpredictable.</p>
<p>▲Hankou cotton futures decline by 0.5 to 0.6 taels. In the early market, American cotton prices had declined for five consecutive days, leading to a weak market sentiment, with prices falling by 0.2 taels. In the afternoon, the weather cleared, and the market sentiment eased, with prices falling by another 0.2 to 0.4 taels. Total trading volume was 100,700 dan. The sellers included Changfeng (3,900 dan), Tianlong (5,300 dan), and Taixing (2,000 dan). The buyers included Jifeng (5,000 dan), Yongfeng (1,600 dan), Yichang (2,000 dan), Yiyu (1,900 dan), Yuanda (1,900 dan), Dafu (1,300 dan), and Yongchang (1,300 dan).

<p>▲American cotton bulls close out positions. Yesterday, the American cotton market was calm and mixed. At the close, prices suddenly fell due to Southern hedging and bull liquidation, with futures falling by 0.09 to 0.11 pounds and spot prices falling by 0.10 pounds.

<p>New York, 4th: The Fuxike Bureau's estimate for this year's new cotton crop is 66.6% of the normal annual production, totaling 14,718,000 bales. The previous estimate (August 6th) was 73.8% of the normal annual production, totaling 14,150,000 bales. The American Cotton Collection Office's estimate for this year's new cotton crop is 65.7% of the normal annual production, totaling 15,503,000 bales. The previous estimate (August 6th) was 70.6% of the normal annual production, totaling 13,451,000 bales.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Last Week's American Cotton Decline Report <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>New York, 4th: A report on the cotton market for the past week states that the decline in cotton prices was due to favorable weather in the South, weakness in the grain and security markets, leading to renewed liquidation by bulls, and some new selling. Supply was absorbed by short covering and buying by fellow traders. The Louisiana legislature has passed a bill prohibiting cotton planting next season, with other states expected to take similar action, affecting approximately 75% of the total American cotton production. However, traders here doubt whether this measure will be effective. Southern sources report that cotton harvesting is significantly delayed, and farmers are selling less. It is also heard that cotton farmers are planning to hoard their cotton in the hope of achieving higher prices through relief measures.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Grain and Rice Market Suspended Due to Rain <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>▲Yesterday in the South City, the source of goods was hindered by the rain, with only No. 1 from the Su-Tong gang, No. 2 from the Pinghu gang, and No. 1 from Qingjiao arriving. However, there were about 40 ships accumulated in the Pu River, near the Fengji Wharf and Dongjiadu area, carrying about 3,200 dan of thick japonica rice, early and late indica rice, and other goods. River boats were unable to unload due to the continuous rain.</p>
<p>▲Yesterday in Xin Zha, no boats arrived due to the persistent wind and rain. Buyers Yuanfeng and Changshun from the same guild ordered 100 bags of foreign pointed rice from Tongxinggong, with delivery limited to two days. River goods could not be unloaded due to the rain.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Taizhou Rice Rises by Two to Three Jiao <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Rice Rises by Several Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market was very strong due to the rain and optimistic sentiment. Both spot and futures prices rose by several fen. Foreign guilds still had no appetite. Local guilds bought actively due to the rise in both white rice and foreign indica rice, and hoarders also bought actively. 800 bags of spot foreign rice Mingdang were sold at 13.6 to 13.55 yuan. 200 bags of Ke Ladi were sold at 13.55 yuan. 200 tons of small Jiaolu cargo were sold on the futures market at 6.5 taels. Another 300 tons for September were sold at 6 mace and 5.5 fen. Local officials purchased Ke Xian Taizhou white rice. Although goods arrived daily, the roads were very active. Yesterday, due to the rain, prices jumped by two to three jiao. Northern guilds were interested in Ke Yuan, offering 240 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled rice at 15.1 yuan, and 14.9 yuan, which was better than previous offers.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Declining Trend in Starch Futures Market <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's starch market saw slightly better bids for foreign wheat in the morning by about 0.2 jiao, and prices for all months improved slightly due to the heavy autumn rain. However, the market atmosphere suddenly changed in the afternoon. The weather had cleared, and the arrival of foreign wheat in China was becoming a reality. A large factory had a large amount of foreign wheat and began selling heavily, reaching 600,000 to 700,000, causing panic and paralysis among those with bullish positions who could not support the market. Looking ahead, if actual sales do not improve, more changes may occur. As a result, this month's prices fell by 0.0175, October's by 0.0225, November's by 0.025, and December to February's by 0.0225.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Wheat Prices Continue to Fall <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw prices for all months rebound by 0.03 to 0.04 in the morning due to slightly better foreign wheat bids and the rain. However, the sharp decline in the afternoon was unexpected. A large factory was reported to have traded a large batch of foreign wheat, and the American relief wheat was certain to become a reality, leading to strong selling pressure. This situation was due to too many real goods, and the bullish position of inland guilds was also shaken. As a result, this month's prices fell by 0.05, October's by 0.04, November's by 0.04, December's by 0.05, January's by 0.06, and February's by 0.04.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Southern and Northern Goods: Hunan White Lotus Gradually Rises <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Due to the flood situation in Hunan, land prices have been gradually rising. According to recent information from the source, each mound requires 30 taels. Prices have also risen accordingly, and inventories are low. Demand from Guangdong and Ningbo for lotus seeds is still considerable, and the trend is firm. Yesterday, Xiangtan lotus was sold at 52 taels, Hengzhou and Raozhou lotus were sold at 50 taels, and Changde lotus was sold at 49 taels. White lotus, initially priced at less than 40 taels, has also been gradually rising, and was sold at 44 taels yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Silk, Tea, Ash-Colored Silk Noil Price Falls by Ten Taels <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign silk market in Shanghai remained unchanged. The sales of eight-cocoon ash-colored silk noil to the United States remained sluggish, and telegrams were not being forwarded. Most hoarders were suppressing cocoon stockpiling, and the market atmosphere was depressed. Yesterday, Xinfu and others delivered 40 bales of high-quality ash-colored silk noil, with prices falling by 10 taels. Weicheng Huaihu factory entered 10 bales, but prices did not rise.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Japanese Cocoons Transferred to Marseille <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>China Refuses to Use Japanese Goods, Stockpiled Cocoons Shipped Out in Batches</p>
<p>Japan's spring and summer cocoons this year had a good harvest. Given the severe shortage of cocoon production in China, and the reduction of import duties on Japanese cocoons, Japanese merchants have been shipping cocoons to Shanghai in large quantities, taking the opportunity to sell them. However, since Chinese manufacturers unanimously refused to purchase Japanese cocoons, the large batches of Japanese cocoons stored in Japanese post offices and foreign warehouses could only be sold through zero-sum sales. Therefore, in recent days, French postal exports have included Japanese cocoons being transferred to other countries. In the past half month, a total of three to four thousand bales of Japanese cocoons have been shipped out, with eight out of ten being shipped to Marseille and other ports in French territory.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Gongxi Green Tea Sales Brisk, Prices Rise <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The market for Gongxi green tea from incoming tea factories showed a trend of development yesterday. The large Russian cooperative that distributes tea, seeing that British, Indian, and Chinese tea merchants were buying tirelessly and stocks were dwindling, telegraphed its Moscow headquarters for instructions, and prices rose sharply by two to three taels. Other goods, such as Zhenmei and Zhenmei needles, were scarce, and European sales were smooth. Chinese tea merchants took a firm stance, and market prices were rising without any fall.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Commonplace Hardware Market <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>▲Market Situation: Yesterday, the autumn rain continued, and hardware transactions became even more sluggish. Customers were mostly taking a wait-and-see approach due to the inconvenience of loading ships. Factories did not purchase much due to it being Saturday. Therefore, the market showed a re-emergence of a relaxed and weak atmosphere. Although hardware merchants hoped for a turnaround in the future and were out soliciting business, they were constrained by the poor environment, and it was unlikely that they would enter a better situation in the short term.</p>
<p>▲Steel Products: Among steel products, transactions in bamboo-joint steel were the most active. However, due to low inventories, the market was very weak, with prices estimated at only 92-93 taels. However, customers still considered the price too high, so transactions were extremely sluggish. Steel plates had a slightly better trend, but apart from the half-fen, seven-li plates, which were relatively active, the others were stagnant. Prices for half-fen plates were 6.6 taels, and for seven-li plates, 6.4 taels. 600-700 dan were released yesterday. Other steel wire and foreign yuan remained quiet.</p>
<p>▲Iron: Plain iron sheets and corrugated iron sheets have seen no improvement in transactions recently, but they are still better than before. Prices have also fallen slightly due to cheaper incoming goods. French-style nails are still in high demand, but prices are not strong, currently estimated at 8.75 taels, down 0.015 taels from before. Black iron sheets are the seasonal product, and sales have started to move slightly. The price is 11 taels. 300-400 bundles were transacted yesterday, handled by the Tianjin gang. Flat steel, angle iron, tinplate, etc., are difficult to sell and the market is in a dismal state. The market for American square nails, round-edged nails, and scrap iron is stable, and prices are also stable.</p>
<p>▲Copper: Since the floods in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, sales of copper have significantly decreased. Decoration by factories in this street has also been minimal, so there is little to report in terms of transactions.</p>
<p>▲Lead: Foreign lead was estimated at 15.75 taels yesterday, and domestic lead was estimated at 15.5 taels. Only the Tianjin, Yantai, Ningbo, and Shaoxing gangs were involved in transactions, with other gangs showing no interest.</p>
<p>▲Tin: The market is also depressed recently. Although the Shaoxing gang is still buying and selling, other routes have not inquired. Overseas telegrams fluctuate wildly, so there is no reliable standard for local sales prices. Fortunately, inventories are not large, and people are not in a state of panic. Therefore, apart from slight fluctuations, prices have not seen any major changes.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 300 bales of Huzhou silk were loaded for shipment to the United States.</p>
