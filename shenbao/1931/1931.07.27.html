<h3>急救水災</h3>
<p>比來霪雨多日。山洪暴發。江河激漲。東西南北。洪水泛濫。怒濤所及。人畜漂流。田廬盡毁。其情形之慘酷。與急待拯救。記者已於前日一評中。略爲陳述。并代被災同胞作懇切急迫之呼籲。現霪雨仍連綿不止。水勢益張。災情日益嚴重。災區日益擴大。幾於半我國土。概成澤國。連日各省各地報災。呼賑之電文。雪片飛來。嘶聲慘呼。血涙交流。吾人試一閉目默索。則瀰漫山谷。一片汪洋。無數同胞。隨波漂流。生者待死。死者暴露之慘絶人寰情狀。當立卽呈現目前。誰無父母。誰無子女。死者固死此已矣。待死者一息尚存。未絶生念。浮沉洪流。仰天泣血念此慘况。假如吾人非鐵石心腸。寗能不則然涙下。前日國府决議撥欵三萬元。急救首都附近災區。但首都附近災情猶輕。其他各地災情之十倍百倍重於首都附近區域者。更無可計數。吾人雖目不能見。但有耳能聞。有腦能思。水災之慘。倍於他災。而其急迫則更如懸絲髮。故早救一時。可少死萬千人生命。早救一日。更可多救數百萬人性命。集全國人之力量。共謀急賑。更謀善後。此時實已不容刻緩。記者謹就見之所及。略貢數點。一曰賑務委員會應急起籌備急賑也。務委員會歷年辦理賑災。成效昭著雖尚有若干計劃。因格於國家財政。未克實現。然該會艱苦進行。終始勿懈。固爲國人所共仰。際此急災。尤應貫澈初衷。急籌急賑。如何捐集大小船隻木板食物破衣藥品。如何分配如何運輸。都應急起籌劃。待死災黎。實已迫切企望。二曰國人應一致節衣縮食捐助急賑也。急難相助。人皆有責。况際此空前浩刦。大地陸沉。寗忍坐視。</p>
<p>不予援用。吾人安處城市。幸未被災。然霪雨多日。猶感苦悶。何况隨波逐浪。旣寒且飢。四望茫茫。概爲絶途。設身處地。其盼人拯救之情。果將何如。國人於此。亟應抱己饑己溺之心。一致節衣縮食。有錢者者捐錢。無錢者卽破衣。敗絮。食物。藥品。木板等。凡災民之所急需者。在我爲廢物。在災民則可換取生命。捐助一份。可救一人。捐助十份。卽救十人。集合衆力。效乃愈大。自動捐助。事更迅速。三曰慈善團體通力合作也。往年賑災慈善團體。多各不相謀。無通盤籌劃。斟酌施賑。故每每事倍而功半。此次急賑應無分公私。通力合作。作有計劃有步驟之進行。庶得收事半功倍之效。四曰衞生行政機關。應籌備豫防災區疫癘也。洪水泛溢。人畜漂流。戸體暴露。微菌叢生。洪水旣過。陽光蒸發。致成癘疫。事在必然。又災區孑遺。旣受饑冷。復被水浸。疾病叢生。亦所難免。故衞生行政機關亟應及早預防。分令災區官府共同致力。母俟其一旦爆發。蔓延全國。更難補救。五曰中央民食委員會應急起調查準備也。此次災區遼闊。未來之荒象已成。如不早謀補救。則食糧缺乏。又將饑莩載途。故民食委員會亟宜（一）調查被災田畝。（二）估計災後不足食糧。（三）預籌糧食。如運用東北利餘之大豆。吸收外國米麥。調查旣明。積屯旣足。然後通盤計算。善爲分配。庶將來不至老弱葬身溝壑。壯者流離道途。凡此五者。皆爲急務。皆應切實做到。此日之所以救人、卽他日之所以救己。國人如尚有良謀善策。望急起共同討論。</p>

<p>無錫女子莊貞英、年華二九、略具姿色、因在原籍靑菓巷地方、與後母同居、時遭虐待、女父莊振寳、在滬虹口武昌路朱福昌鐵器店爲夥、貞英於前晨乘滬寗火車來申、找尋乃父、但人地生疏、不知武昌路究在何處、誤走至五馬路、足力疲乏、遂雇江北人朱德標之黄包車、着其至武昌路鐵廠、經過蓬路、適有同鄉人顧芝全幣見、向她詢得其情、遂勸其回籍、因</p>
<p>滬上歹人頗多　殊屬危險、如懼後母之虐待、儘可至渠家暫住、並覔絲廠工作、着往北火車站乘車返藉、詎個中情形、咸被黄包車夫朱德標所聞、頓起不良之心、當將貞英拖往西安路一帶、緩緩而行、正擬</p>
<p>設計將其販賣　而貞英亦忽然變念、不願回籍、着朱德標轉往武昌路找父、朱車夫聆語、適中其懷、在該路一千九百十一號西安旅館門首停車、向貞英謂汝暫居旅館、遂無賴同籍桑小二子·徐二虎子·兩人言明貞英之來蹤、以郭寳山之假名、開二十號房間將女安置</p>
<p>僞稱代尋其父　詎·桑徐·兩人見貞英年幼鄉愚無知、容貌不惡、各生染指之心、徐待桑出房時、向貞英謂若汝肖嫁吾、當購綢旗袍與汝穿、買高跟皮鞋與汝着、兌金戒與汝戴、百般哄騙、貞英俯首不言、移時徐出桑進、亦向貞英曰、吾尚無妻室、汝允隨吾、當爲購麗服給汝章身、偕往新新樂園遊玩、俄頃朱德標歸、勸貞英曰、</p>

<h3>評日本自鳴第一流之商大球隊（陸鍾恩）</h3>
<p>丨戰門實力尚强丨藝術方面欠佳丨</p>
<p>▲七戰五負二勝丨一平庸球隊而已</p>
<p>自鳴爲日本第一流之商大籃球隊、來滬挑戰、已有七次、以歷次之成績、與滬上諸球隊之實力互相比較、祇可稱爲平庸之材、惟該隊戰鬥力殊覺頑强、堪稱上乘、惟於藝術方面、尚欠研究、是故七戰之中、勝二而負五、今者鄙人將歷次比賽時、所注意各方角逐之大概、略誌於後、以供讀者之研究、</p>
<p>（一）商大對梵航　是役乃商大之第一戰、梵航因人馬不齊、而不幸被挫、是晚商大並未見得高明、梵航二後衞略見薄弱、對於接濟及防禦方面、時現錯誤、結果梵航不幸以三十四與三十一之比失敗、</p>
<p>（二）商大對鷹隊　是役商大自始至終、未見得利、雖作戰極爲猛烈、然因操之過急、而失去良機不少、投籃時機、每每不能得心應手、查鷹隊三前鋒、皆非個中老手、雖有持志之孔、廣益將爲之效力、然觀衆之心理、皆謂無一線希望、孰知經四十分中之奮鬬、竟以三十四與二十五之比數克客軍、誠百靈機也、</p>
<p>（三）商大對砲隊　商大於不景氣中、忽恢復其第一晚之能力、將砲隊壓倒、查砲隊都係善戰之士、祇因投籃工夫欠缺、得球機會減少、然至終未能盡善盡美、引爲憾事、待比賽終結、商大以三十六與之三十二之數、獲第二次之勝利、</p>
<p>（四）商大對復聯　復聯集新舊同學組成勁旅、抵抗商大、全隊合作、堪稱純熱、郭陸二鋒、時攬敵人籃圈、加之内衞之費盡心力、卒將敵軍擊退、比數爲二十六與十九、是戰雙方動作、多有越規之處、全劇精華全失、不免美中不足、</p>
<p>（五）商大對紅光　紅光係光華與紅隊併合而成、一路戰况與復聯大同小異、以百折不撓之精神、加之幸運之得當、奪取最後之勝利、是戰商大較復聯之戰更覺退步、於最後六分鐘之時、雖曾將大橋植田二遠東戰將加入作戰、然仍歸一敗途地、投籃之不稱心、與進攻之不能隨時機而變化、爲日隊歷次失敗之最大原因、總結紅光三十一、商大二十七、</p>
<p>（六）商大對持志　持志及江大冠軍、實力自當在商大之上、然商大亦因之而出全力以應付、雙方競爭、殊爲劇烈、持隊以技術之優長、投籃之正確、一路在前領導、下半時商大不幸主軍永井、以四次犯規而被罰出場、是故至比賽終結、商大負十二分、（比數爲三十二與二十）是役雙方因猛烈之爭鬬而被罰有二十八次之多、造成商大挑戰賽中之最高數目</p>
<p>（七）商大對滬中　滬中籃球隊、鑒於商大技術之幼稚、遂决於藝術方面、力求變化、查商大之優點、全在作戰之認眞而耐久、猛衝直撞、絲毫無轉變之智識、是故滬中諸健兒抱「我不犯人」之主見、將純粹之藝術、對付客軍、於守衞上、鑒於日隊之專重近投與籃下爭球投擲、一方取「五人地位」守衞法、（Ｆive　Men　Position　Defence）另一方嚴密監視日軍之唯一投手永井氏、於進攻上、一方用迅速之反擊（Ｄuick　Breaks）以攻人不備、一方用「穿陣」（Ｃut　fns）「彈地傳遞」（Ｂounce　Pass）與使用在罰球區域内之投擲、蓋對方亦談同樣之五人聯防陣（Ｆive　Men　Defence）商大如其於下半時内、採用滬中之進攻術、則决不至負有三十分之多、</p>
<p>總而言之、商大之征滬、實大非所望、所謂日本第一流之球隊之技、我華人已見之、我人甚望下次日本可遺一無敵錦標隊來滬周肇、較一上一下、是則華日之究竟、可不方而喻、</p>
<p>聯軍如連球砲一般的開始猛攻、中華佈置尚未大定、驟臂强敵壓境手忙脚亂、被敵殺破中關、葡人（域陀）勇猛異常、挾球飛進、乘勢斜义一脚、陳門頭挽救不及、於是未及五分鐘聯隊首告勝利、</p>
<p>▲中華卽還臉色</p>
<p>中華驟不及防、着一谿蛋、那肯放鬆、個個生龍猛虎、誓還江山、混戰十餘分鐘、不分勝負、那知禍起於微、李如臣御球偷渡、連破二道防線、李義雙馬迎戰、攬成一團圓、球從馬腹流出、盧齊元眼急脚快、球飛如矢、名將周賢言亦莫可如何、春色遂告平分、</p>
<p>▲華軍續報勝利</p>
<p>轉戰五分鐘後、該軍似乎鬆懈、交遞失了拍手、當然授人以隙、何佐賢本是良將、那能失此千載之機、趕快接濟前方、俾好從容從事、麥老棟奉命前往、邊關銜銜殺來、銳不可當卑利曹失了打點、敗下陣來、適當地點從中一遞、圓球從天而下、直搗龍門、孫鐵腿（錦順）近水樓台、捨足而頭、斜起一錐、應聲入網、</p>
<p>▲大告山奴一足</p>
<p>未幾掉位再戰、聯隊軍容太振、前五鋒如雁字一排、奮勇前進、中華中關被破、空氣頓形緊張、海家球躍馬前來、神氣十足、挾球飛來、勢加出陳蛟龍、黄梁兩將、迎上殺成混戰、陳卽斜遞中鋒、大告山奴原是異國名將、乘機一長、奪回已失江山、其功不小、</p>
<p>▲火車頭竟奏功</p>
<p>中華有比一失、出人意料之外、口中之肉被人奪去、怎樣令人甘心、急謀反攻、連環殺來、陳璞忙中一足、華軍失效而退、火車頭二次左關開來、卑利曹擋之不住、直逼左角一遞球向龍門直下、爲勢峻急異常、周賢言拳打不應、球乃直鑽網窩、淸晳美觀、</p>
<p>▲最後平分春色</p>
<p>球戰至此、空氣陡形緊張、一前一退、無不博得萬人鼓掌、中華球以紀錄已成三比二、嚴守陣地、以退爲進、聯隊亟亟調兵遣將、着速奪回已失江山、未幾陳鎭和挾球進攻、陳錫培迎來欲撲、人球滾地、挽成一團、黑炭欲踢、錫培死不放手、球證一聲笛鳴、聯以解圍、判爲「公正球」從空一抛、看是誰先得手、黑炭以在網之魚、豈容放走撥開一足、圓球受命飛去、果然皇天不昧苦心人、終竟獲得最後勝利、無何戰笛一鳴、戰幕徐徐落下、一對難兄難弟、殺個平手、整隊而來、依然整隊而去、</p>

<h3>中國教育的一箇新方面</h3>
<p>丨中央政治學校（一）星野</p>
<p>中央政治學校、課程的嚴格、紀律的嚴肅、校風的優良、發展的迅速、已漸爲社會所注意、此種學校、在教育史上、佔一特殊之地位、其影響於中國將來之政治、必有可觀、想國内一般人士、樂於有精確可靠之認識、所以把他的詳細記載下來以俾參考、按世界各國裏面的政治學校、没有幾個、最著名而且是僅有的和可以數得出來的祇有法國Ｉ‘Ｆcocle　des　Sciences　Politiques和德國的Ｐoljtische　Hochschule兩個都是大學的性質、和巴黎大學同柏林大學同在一個城裏、相提並論程度亦是一樣、很巧的事事巴黎的政治學校、是設立在一八七一年普法戰爭之後、要圖政治上的刷新、以恢復普法戰爭後法國所損失的國際地位、德國的政治學校、設立在一九一九年巴黎和約之後、因爲當時德人只承認前次大戰、不是軍事之失敗而是政治之失敗、爲改革政治計、以圖復興、而中國的中央政治學校、恰巧設立在國民政府定都南京以後、當正以復興中國民族改革中國政治爲號召的時期、亦是同樣大學的程度、就其演化的軌跡看去、漸漸趨向於辦成丨特别是辦成法國的政治學校的樣子、</p>
<p>當國府定都南京之時、中央因感覺實際工作人員之缺、於是成立了中央黨務學校、這個學校、就是中央政治學校的前身、黨務學校訓練期間爲一年、程度雖有參差、但是許多是大學畢業生及專學校的畢業生、這一班畢業以後、不久就改爲中央政治學校、修業期間、合爲四年、招收立案高中及大學預科畢業學生、其程度遂和國立大學之一樣、而且招生嚴格、是政治學校一種特殊的現象、現在政治學校裏面、一二年級學生、都是平均自十四人中取一個的、教授方面、多一時知名之士、因地在首都、所以除專任教授以外、聘請專門人員、兼任講師職務、亦較爲容易、就現在情形而論、其待遇較首首任何大學爲高、選聘資格亦甚嚴、原來此校分爲行政系·財政系·地方自治系·社會經濟系等四系、其分類與一般大學校畢、至民國二十年一月一日、羅家倫氏回校以後、立定宗旨、要將該校辦成法國政治學校的樣子、認爲此種分法、尚覺寬乏、欲造就專門人材、非集中學生興趣於其所認定之專門學校不可、不然、則與普通大學一樣、一方面旣不能比擬外國大學、使學生在畢業以後、對於學理有深刻之研究、一方面又不能供給政治社會以實際需要、事事能做、結果一事不能做、於是他便定下一個根本的計畫於各系以下、再分組别、使學生對於其欲專心研究之功課、有一中會的需要和學生所担任的工作爲對象、所以在確定方針以後、就其原有各系之下、分爲各組、行政系分普通行政·法律·外交三組、法律組之目的、爲造就司法官典獄官及行政法院監察院人員、因法律方面、中國的人材本來不多而將來領事裁判權取消以後、要求於司法人材者更大、欲使各地的地方法院對民刑訴訟的裁决、不受國際輿論之指摘、我們便需要良善的司法人材、其次是普通行政組、注重政策之實施的研究及機關管理之知識、以增加行政効能、第三是外交組、注重於外交問題之研究、並養成使領館人材、法律組之屬於行政系、純係一歷史之演化、將來或設專系、亦未可知、於財政系之下、分設財務行政及金融等二組、財務行政組、注重租稅徵收與預稅審計等之實施及規畫、金融組則以造就幣制及國立公立金融機關之實用之材爲目的、更次爲地方自治系、分設市政·農村行政·地政·及警政等四組、市政組注重城市設計、警察、公共衞生及救濟等問題、農村行政組、注重農村行政農村教育、民權實施訓練、森林保護等問題、地政組·注重土地測量登記及公有土地經營及土地法之實施、以培養整理全國土地人材、警政組·爲培養担負全國公安責任之人材、除警察行政而外、授以充分法律知識、兼注重社會調查及統計等問題、該二組因籌備起來、比較困難、所以暫行緩設、第四是社會經濟系、設公用·合作·統計及工商行政等四組、公用組、注重公用事業經營管理及監督問題、合作組注重合作事業之指導及經營及其有關之技術、統計組注重各種統計技能之訓練、工商行政組則注重勞資仲裁、工廠管理及工廠監察制度之實施及國外貿易之改進事項這是各組設立之目的及其施教方針、到了本年的六月、得到中央的許可、添設教育系、分設教育行政及鄉村教育兩組、現在教育行政人材之缺乏、已是很明顯的事實、而鄉村教育推進之需要、言中國問題者類能道之、這一系的設立、也是切合國家需要而設立的、以上所述、乃是　　學校本科的情形、現在本科還只辦到三年級、下半年才有四年級、所以現在這個學校、還没有過畢業學生、</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>腦的博物院</p>
<p>全世界最奇怪的博物院。現已成立於奥國的首都維也納。是附屬於一所研究人類智慧的科學院。而專陳列人腦的。院中已得到了不少過去的才人的腦。而現在活着的才人。也差不多有一千人都已答應將來身死之後。把他們的腦送往院中陳列。歐洲人的腦。男子平均爲四十五兩。婦女爲四十兩。以大概說。越是智慧的人。腦也越重。英國大詩人拜倫氏Ｂyron腦重六十兩。德國大哲學家康德氏。Ｋant腦重五十五兩。而俄國大文學家杜基納人民Ｔurgenier更超過他們。竟重至六十七兩。要知道腦的重量。不必放在天秤中稱。只須量那腦殼的大小。更可很正確的知道腦的輕重。倘將古代人的腦和現代人的腦比較起來。智慧相去極遠。爪哇的猩猩人。和世界各地的野蠻人種。他們的腦都是極輕的。但是二三萬年以前上古時代法蘭西有幾處地方。發明火石取火的人。與西班牙石窟中畫那美麗的壁畫的人。他們的腦也就和現代人的腦一般輕重。這是不可一概而論的更有一個例外的例外。便是全世界最重的腦的紀錄。計重七十七兩。却是屬於一個獃子。豈不可怪。</p>
<h3>没出息的民族性</h3>
<p>— 周才良</p>
<p>自萬寳山案發生以來。我僑韓同胞子被殺者。無慮數百。以是而有國民對日經濟絶交之表示。亦可謂無辦法中之一辦法。弱國無外交。言之可嘆。猶憶蔡孑民行狂有言。「親日固不可。仇日亦有未妥。惟知日乃最有效。」蓋有　夫日本人之於中國。幾瞭若指掌。而我國人之於彼等。竟一無所知。惟鄙意知日固覺重要。而知韓亦不可少。然欲知人之長短。尤非親歷其境者不可。予友潘君。新自游韓歸來。感觸良多。曾爲予述之如下。韓人亡國之大原因。厥惟三貪。一曰貪吃。惟其貪吃。於是只知消費而不知生産。二曰貪懶。惟其貪懶。則百事皆不可爲矣。三曰貪錢。惟其貪錢。乃致利欲薰心。而不知有國家。日人知其然而故使其然。寖漸而乃有利用彼等爲仇華之傀儡。此種没出息民族之甘心爲虎作倀。固無可怪。甚願身居獨立國家之華人。亟知其所以然而勿使其然。是則日人雖狡。恐亦將無所施其技矣。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （鵑）</p>
<p>對日經濟絶交。是吾們無可奈何中唯一的方法。若并此而不能辦到。并此而不能堅持到底。那眞是昔人所謂「哀莫大於心死了。」更有一個要點。就是主持檢貨的人。務須鐵面無私。風淸弊絶。若敢受一文錢的賄賂。那就不啻見旅韓僑胞被殺以後。更在他們身上偷吃内的殘塊。偷啜血的餘瀝。這種人便是全無心肝的陳叔寳</p>
<h3>史地測騐之趣答案</h3>
<p>— 學遷</p>
<p>學校中之有歷史地理二科。其目的雖在通今知古。實則無非明瞭人生過程與現在之狀况而已。故除大學校有史地專門之研究外。其在中小學生。大都屬於普通常識。爲事實上所必應知曉者。教材中所必宜採及者。本屆暑期内。上海市立務本女中招考新生。於試騐三民主義·國文·算學·等科目外。史地爲常識之一種。當然亦在測騐之列。乃其結果。答案之謬誤者甚爲不少。如孔子爲某時人。有塡唐代者。有塡宋朝者。佔全數十分之四五。有塡周字者。尚能明白其時代。至塡春秋者。僅十之一二。又如七雄之名稱。竟有塡寫英美德法日意奥者。可謂</p>
<p>大謬。甚至塡湯武爲平民革命者。已甚好笑。而司馬懿二子。一名○。一名○。有一生塡司馬遷。與司馬光。上下相去有八九百年。則謬誤至極。更令人噴飯者。題爲三國時最有智謀的人呌○○○。某生竟塡「詩易毫」三字。初閱之下。殊不知其所指。細爲思索。恍然大悟。蓋卽諸葛亮之誤也。又江寗條約之五口通商。任何人當知其地點。孰料或則不能舉其名。或則略而不全。或則名稱多誤。亦可見常識之缺乏。至上海市之中心區域在○○○。乃有塡南京者。有塡廣州者。於最近之情形。猶不之知。若其沿海七省。與本部之三大流域。更鮮淸楚。曾憶去年有一題爲試舉中國鐵路四大幹線之名。應考高中一某生。其答語爲一黄火幹。二火幹。三赤火幹。推究其何以有此大謬。取題紙閱之。則以大字一畫中間稍斷。而某生竟誤認爲火字。鑄成大錯。不亦可笑之甚耶。總之此次務中新生史地測騐。答案之發現趣語者甚多。凡茲所錄。尚其大略。某有感於學生普通常識之缺乏。爰稍露其端。投諸本談。願負教育責者其注意焉。</p>

<p>吾國歌曲之新作家　自推黎錦暉氏爲全國人望。惟黎氏之曲。於少女兒童最爲相稱。壯男爲之。便露忸怩。黎氏之外。尚有杜庭修氏。昕夕致力於中西音樂。廣有心得。能自譜新聲。隨曲意之哀樂。而發洩其感情。復倩名儒塡製淸雅通俗之詞語。别創一格。完全注重歌唱。不落他人窠臼。聆者莫不神往焉。余識杜君之名。係自南京勵志社中探得。維時杜君方任該社幹事。盛爲黨國名人所稱道。博學多才。識者稱之。前閱報章。見大中華公司刋登發行杜君新曲之唱片廣告。深喜此音樂家之克展所抱。爰購取一套。一快先聆。但覺其音節鏗鏘。譜詞簡潔。絲竹悠揚。寓意高超。能將心坎中所發出之情緒。洩露於外。以較流行之時調。如仙箏之與胡索。别有風味。信乎可以傅矣。又杜君對於基督教。薰染頗久。深以吾國無讚美時之唱片爲憾。特自靑島聘來名鋼琴手都禮華君伴奏。同時灌收讚美詩多種。亦一别開生面之佳作也。</p>
<h3>哭唐腴廬</h3>
<p>— 嚴恩椿</p>
<p>我識君才十四歲。駢黄儷綠已仙仙。時人一見王夷甫。說是金童下九天三載同堂百數子。惟君與我與元龍。（陳元龍遭普濟輪船之厄時隔已十四年矣）而今只騰藍衫客。哭向秋風秋雨中。</p>
<p>東坡浮查海外歸。東西勞燕各飛飛。前年香雪屏前過（前年余與志摩等參觀普益習藝所書畫展覽會與君相逅數語而散）今日瞢騰月下遲</p>
<p>報國捐軀君素志。最憐市上淆聽聞。堂堂財政部司掾。顚倒大書宋子文。（前日報載宋子文秘書唐某中彈殞命故爲更正）（却酬）</p>
<p>▲徵聯贈書　張君隣秋。本吳興望族。乃祖若父。頗著政聲。彼亦投身黨國。曾握軍政要職。性格洒脫。愛交好游。生平著作甚夥。惟非素知。不肯輕以示人。一如其書。去年春。譚延闓等以其書法具有特長爲訂潤格於南京。唯定潤過昂。乞書者。每多興望洋之嘆。此次張君由首都來滬。迄已月餘。以爲滬上一味繁華。翻不若白下之游。尚有耐人尋味處也。近故作有上聯云。「下白下。上上海。海上游興下白下。」如蒙海内同文。不吝珠玉。惠以下聯者。當贈書（扇面楹聯。可遂所請）爲報。件交上海南京路明商店芮鴻初君代轉。（鴻雁館主）</p>
<h3>美國婦女生活雜談（上）</h3>
<p>— 寄</p>
<p>錢劍秋女士。近自美國回來。伊在西北大學研究院專攻法學。榮膂博士學位。我們並不是推崇學位。但看伊精明强幹。落落有丈夫氣。確是吾國婦女界新進的健者。一昨相晤。談次、詢以美國婦女界近狀。承縷析見告。其同學黄比瀛氏復爲補充一二。現在把它分錄如下。</p>
<p>▲裝束　美國婦女。大都以　髮爲美觀。普通女子在十六歲以上。便喜歡燙髮。四十歲以上那就很少了。燙髮旣然很普遍。在伊們看起來。好像男子穿西裝。一定要打領結同樣的需要。每晚臨睡以前。必用肥皂洗面。次用淨膚膏。（Ｃleansing　Cream）擦面。此膏有揮發性。可使汗毛孔展</p>
<p>舒。去淨孔内汚屑。再擦潤膚膏。（Ｔissue　cream）這是睡前的衞生。並不是求美觀。晨起擦盡。拍粉點臙脂。粉不限於白色。也有淺紅。淡黄。與面色形似的　。這種化妝品。質料精純。不傷皮膚。善於裝飾的且以巴黎出品爲貴。彼邦婦女。無一不講求裝飾。否則以爲失却了禮貌。衣服。近來時式長裙没踝。冬季尚黑色。長袖。夏季尚白色。或各種淺色。無袖。衣料以印花爲多。伊們四季都穿單依。只是衣料有些厚薄之分。衣的腰身極窄而胸部寬大。便於穿着。衣與裙相連而無領。出必戴帽。帽的形式。各各不同色澤常與衣、鞋相類。伊們出門或逢宴會。都是盛裝艷服。而平素在家。不講穿着。爲了便於操作家務之故。</p>
<p>▲飲食　美國婦女。都喜歡吃肉類。但爲了保持姿態的美觀。恐怕脂肪質吃得太多了。容易肥胖。因此不敢多吃。每餐只吃一兩片肉類。魚·蝦·蘇薯·菜蔬等類。是日常的佐膳品。此外有一種罐頭。呌做「雜碎」。其中有多量肉類。烹調得法。很合伊們的胃口。這種罐頭。大都是紐約。芝加哥城裏華僑所製的伊們自己不會煮。因此華僑做罐頭生意的。利市三倍。這種店舖。也日見增加了。一日三餐之外。還喜歡吃水菓·糖·餅·咖啡·飲茶的也不少。伊們以爲茶可以淸脾胃。去油膩。從前中國茶在美銷路最暢。現在日本茶。印度茶。也很佔勢力。大概天産純良的中國茶。總比不過人工揀製的日本茶。可見無論那一樣東西。全憑天産的優美。不加人工來精製。是很容易受淘汰的。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>女人女人（一）</h3>
<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>休業典禮舉行的一天，女生宿舍裏失去了平時恬靜的狀態。同伴間相互的問訊，道别，送禮物，充分地表露出女性的深摯的同性。甚而有幾個人是失聲哭了，像小羊般依依地不忍離開伊們的故居和佳侣。</p>
<p>但是喜劇也到處開演着：王小姐把懸掛在牀頭墻上的范倫鐵拿的畫像拿了下來，親自送到潘小姐那裏去。却笑着說：「這是你的，你的夢裏的情人，還了你吧！」潘小姐面上雖然有些嗔怒，但一隻手却自然地把這畫像接受了下來。</p>
<p>還有女宿舍的看門的王媽，收納了一個姓朱的男生的兩毫大洋的賄賂，把一隻密封的錦盒，送到了徐小姐那裏。徐小姐開盒一看，却是十個紅蛋，伊發怒了，但許多人的笑聲畢竟把伊的怒氣抑制了下去。祇是十個紅蛋都丢在地上，</p>
<p>給王媽收拾去了。</p>
<p>在混亂的景象中，那個號稱皇后的丁小姐也在整理着寫字檯上的東西。伊想起了當學期開始的時候，一切的東西都裝在兩隻皮箱裏，可是過了四個月，四隻皮箱也裝不下這許多東西了：添置的衣衫是不用說，便是一副燙頭髮用的器具和一隻修指甲用的化裝盒。也得裝上一隻箱子而有餘。</p>
<p>王媽突然地走來，說：「丁小姐顯然是胸有成竹地表「還是昨天的那個朱先生麽？只說我回家去了。」丁小姐顯然是胸有成竹地表示拒絶。王媽也就應命而去了。</p>
<p>不多時，丁小姐的一切東西都收拾好了：箱子裏裝不下，把毯子和褥子都當做包裹，還裝不下，祇得犧牲了幾張平時留置着的畫報。</p>
<p>終於離開了這個靑春之宫闕，呌王媽去雇　一輛汽車，把兩隻箱子呌王媽提了，自己挾上兩個小包，送上車去：還有兩個大包，却有兩個不相識的男子自告奮勇地給伊搬了出來；這兩個人也是校裏的學生。據說這一天他們是專誠來女生宿舍之外等候着女同學們的使命的。</p>
<p>操塲上不聽見壯烈的球聲，祇有三三兩兩的男同學們，集中在從女生宿舍到校門口的必由之路上徘徊着。丁小姐從車窗裏襲的笑語中，還隱約聽得他們對於自己的崇尊的讚美。</p>

<h3>證劵　上週債市平靜</h3>
<p>▲趨勢滯定較前週上落甚微</p>
<p>上星期内本埠證券市場各債券市况、現貨交易益稀、全週祇做開二萬四千九百元、中除裁兵佔一萬零九百元、餘均極寥落、期市亦以環象沉靜、每日成交、亦頗閒散、除週初一日達一千九百餘萬、餘日多僅在一千四百萬元左右、週四以祇有下午一盤交易、僅開六百數十萬元、統計全週成交總數八千一百九十八萬元、不及前週者達三千八百數十萬元、其中二十年關稅較多、佔二千八百五十九萬、其他如二十年捲烟一千三百七十九萬元、一九關一千零五十三萬元、一九善九百七十三萬元、編遣庫券六百四十六萬五千元、九六公債二百四十二萬、整理六釐一百三十六萬、關稅庫券一百零五萬五千元、金融及七年各祇五千元、又統稅庫券陸續成交十萬零五千元、再初開拍之上海銀行股現貨成交二十股、</p>
<p>至言上星期内各債券市價之變動情形、環象非常沉悶、已如下述、而時局亦少轉機、粤方問題旣未解决、北方石軍又告叛離、且討赤結束、亦尚有待、市上人心虛弱、大戸僉懷觀望、求供雖均衡、債價稍覺呆滯、每日上落甚微、查週一各債券多漲八九角至一元七八角、週二回跌、九關善二○關捲各小八九角、週三轉堅、二○關約好一元、其他亦好半元左右、週四復返疲、惟祇小數角、週五跌勢較勁、一九善二○關捲跌六七角至一元數角、週末一日亦疲滯如故、其趨勢蓋始終是混亂也、結果較前星期互有漲跌、爲數殊殊、觀其趨勢、交割前似難有大漲落也、又證交已定下週一起對於八月期取消賣方現品提供、改收證金二千元、惟對於尚未開拍之九月期貨、賣出仍以提供現品爲限、茲將上星期内各債價高低漲落統計列後、（單位元）</p>

<h3>紗花　上週紗銷大活</h3>
<p>▲細紗不敷供給</p>
<p>▲人標漲二兩外</p>
<p>紗市在上週初異常挺秀、因檢查劣貨工作日見嚴厲、本紗較堅、四十二支細紗一日間飛漲二十餘兩、因貨物缺乏、不敷供給、各帮復購現趕裝、因此日線突然猛跳、十六支二十支本紗價格步步向上、現貨根子日見緊俏、但十支粗紗生意不動、至於客方、鑒於抵制空氣熱烈、大衆爲未雨綢繆計、紛紛購辦不絶、故現貨交易益覺興奮、行情有漲無跌、標紗亦隨之漲、而多數投機家蜂擁而來、故場中形勢日緊、然粗紗走銷仍滯、某巨戸依然抛空、包額愈積愈巨、所以受其壓迫亦不小也、標紗中途漲風頗銳、以現銷發展、本紗緊俏、買進者愈衆、未幾海外花紗狀况趨跌、北方戰事發生、市盤稍回跌、結果各月價比前週漲二兩以外、全週成交計二十二萬六千二百五十包、買去内地·廣東·四川三帮爲最多、紗市照大勢論之、仍在平定之局、不過天雨不止、各方水災報告日趨嚴重、一般神經過敏、預料秋銷將大受打擊也、茲將各帮口買去之量額、分誌於後、</p>

<h3>上週棉價漲一兩左右</h3>
<p>▲受墨雨之惠</p>
<p>棉市在週初甚平靜、因海外棉市不振、金價亦在盤旋中、而現棉各廠一無需要、交易全絶、故人心尤虛、市面大袞、未幾天雨綿綿、同時漢口陜西棉被洪水冲害、損失較巨、來滬補空、市面被其激起、旋以本埠雨勢浩大、各方水災日烈、於是内地帮紛紛來申購買、漲風轉銳、惟火機帮及申帮一致抛出、而印美兩棉又跌、壓迫尚重、故漲風尚平、但迴顧國内水災已成、新棉生産大受打擊棉市前途、不堪設想也、標棉各月價比前週漲一兩左右、現棉交易岑寂、來源計姚花二千二百十包、標棉成交計五十五萬七千五百擔、美棉比前週跌四十磅音、茲將廠商及行號買去之包額分誌於後、</p>

<p>▲南市　各帮來源寥寥無幾、城鄉店交緣天時不正、且聞各路發水、暴漲不已、厚粳鮮料又加一二角不等、惟中宿平常、薄稻到亦無幾、寗胃及街銷緣昨到貨缺乏、進意頗燥、市價又昂二尺、但近午後約祇四五號、胃納似轉平勢、洋蘆尖受客米暴增、走勢俏利、市形跟緊、糯米隂元貨稀、價亦殛漲三角、</p>

<h3>水手本色</h3>
<p>— 王冰茜</p>
<p>下課鐘打過以後、我們四個人便陸續地回到房内、各人似乎都有些不高興、原因是爲了平日一天玩到晚的我們、臨到期考了、功課還是莫名其妙、</p>
<p>「唉、日子好快啊、後天要大考哩、」珠嘆息着</p>
<p>「都是我不好、平日吵得你們書也讀不成、」琇掉着滬說、</p>
<p>「倒霉的鬍子、讀本要考到六十多頁、還有老李這東西、明天要我們交算衞練習本呢、」淑急得在跥脚、因爲人家算術練習題多的做到六七本簿子、少的也有兩三本、她却半本也没有、</p>
<p>「我要做算術去了、」淑拿着一手書、並且墨水瓶哪、橡皮哪、許多東西到閱報室去、</p>
<p>於是珠坐在桌傍看書、琇　在床上念英文、我在抄札錄、頓時打破我們房間裏的用功記錄、</p>
<p>「噲、噲、」淑一手拿着一張報子、一手握着一大包花生米、興高采烈的跳進來、「你們看卡爾登在做」「水手本色」了、我們去看好不好、」</p>
<p>「附議、」我把抄本一按說、「誰有心緒去抄、快去吧、五點一刻了、珠·琇·怎樣、一</p>
<p>「别裝腔了、」淑把珠的化學向地上一丢、</p>
<p>「我可不去、」琇的確是在認眞攻書了、</p>
<p>「今天是我們逍遥的末一天啦、」我說、「此後我們天各一方、那裏還有機會聚首呢、别掃人興趣、」</p>
<p>「我們可怎樣出校門呢、被老狐看見了可不得了呢、」珠說、</p>
<p>「不打緊、一個個偷走就是了、」淑望着我笑、</p>
<p>「好好、不過珠别打扮得太婀娜、查出了不是玩的、」我教訓她、</p>
<p>「哼、你自己才惹人注目呢、兩個小辮子、」</p>
<p>在五分鐘内我們什麽都弄好了、一個個鬼鬼祟祟的跑到電車站、好容易上了電車、</p>
<p>「看、看、章先生、」琇喊着、我們不約而同的向她手指的方向看去、正是章先生坐在前面三等車内、歪着頭向外面望、我們四個人把頭低着、尤其我怕被他看見兩個小辮子、驚恐地躱在淑的身邊、也不敢談話、也不敢笑、眼巴巴的望到了目的地、跳下車來、急急地步行到卡爾登、</p>
<p>「啊、假如在影戲院内遇到了先生、那就糟啦、」我膽怯的說、</p>
<p>「來已來了、難道退回去不成、」淑說、「我想先生們都是吝嗇鬼、誰願意化一元錢一張票呢、」我也點頭表示同意、於是我們都買了票進去、</p>
<p>裏面已擠了許多觀衆、我們就揀在很後面坐着、自由自在地談笑、</p>
<p>「不好了、何先生、趙先生、來先生、那面那面、」</p>
<p>淑驚呌着、</p>
<p>我們望見她們三位、貼正坐在我們前面第六排、</p>
<p>「怎樣辦法呢、」我着急極了、</p>
<p>「快把頭低下、别給她們瞧見、」琇命令着、</p>
<p>「她們在向後看呢、」淑在偷看她們</p>
<p>的動靜、</p>
<p>珠把冰冷的手緊握着我、我覺得她在發抖、</p>
<p>「開幕後就不怕了、」還是琇有些主意、</p>
<p>全塲黑暗了、米曲羅新聞片和滑稽、片都　過了、「水手本色」　在銀幕上、</p>
<p>「我們必須在未散塲前出去、不然一定要被她們看見、」我提議、她們都贊成、</p>
<p>「珠、别怕啊、」淑也發覺珠嚇得可憐極了、</p>
<p>「被—被她們看—看見了怎麽辦呢、」珠嗚咽着、</p>
<p>「我們還是現在就走吧」琇知道我們再也没有心思看戲了、</p>
<p>在六點鐘以前、我們趕回到學校裏、</p>
<p>眞好悔氣、化了四塊錢、戲没有看着、到落得一塲虛驚、我們眞懊傷極啦、</p>
<h3>畢業前後</h3>
<p>— 晚</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>憲是本屆法學院政治系畢業的「學士」、没有畢業以前、大家都稱他縣長、—也有戲呼海門縣縣長—因爲憲塊頭大、相貌雄偉、「賣相（？）煞是像個縣長、憲自己也樂受這個「縣長」稱呼、頗有畢業後非縣長不就之概、</p>
<p>畢業了一個半月多了、憲寫快信掛號信、紛馳親友……至今尚無把握、不要說縣長、連四五十元一月的機關的辦事員、中小學校教員、尚不可得、急得大塊頭坐臥不安、</p>
<p>憲的一線希望、唯有懇求政治系主任先生在市教育局找位置了、憲對他的主任先生說、「無論做甚麽事、隨便、……」但他仍對人常說、「我在十年之内、終得個縣長做、算命先生算命、我二十七歲二十八歲兩年内、交官運呀……」</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>墨是本屆教育學院畢業的「學士」、在學校裏、很是活動、任學生會主席、和副校長頗接近、……他常常對人表示、他畢業以後、唯一的出路、决有賴副校長的援引了、</p>
<p>畢業已一個半月多了、下秋的職位、還没有着落、在暑期學校裏、副校長校裏辦公也來的、墨恐怕在校裏和副校長談話、不大方便、索性到他家裏吧、</p>
<p>日中恐怕不在家、晚上去吧、晚上九時去吧、</p>
<p>墨前日晚上九時、到副校長家裏去了、</p>
<p>「先生、」墨剛才吐出「先生、」下語没者說完、　　　聲說「出去了、」　語　度、似乎含有侮辱的意味、</p>
<p>墨從門外望進去、明明副校長在裏面、不過聽得有人見他、他急轉身上樓了、一刹那間、被墨窺視無遺、</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>純是本屆理學院畢業的「學士」、他將要畢業的時候、曾懇請他的導師先生找事、一天、碰到了導師先生、</p>
<p>「先生、請你找……因我……」純戰戰兢兢囁嚅的說不出口來、</p>
<p>「好的、……」導師先生慨然允之、純心中的快慰、難以形容、一推一挽、决賴導師先生了、</p>
<p>某日的晚上、純再赴導師先生的家裏、見導師先生、探聽佳音、並懇求一切、</p>
<p>「鄉村師範裏、或有位置、我當留意、」因爲導師先生兼任鄉村師範主任、</p>
<p>純快慰、彭舞、興辭而出、</p>
<p>導師先生辭本大學某科主任、和鄉村師範主任、赴南京中央政治學校任教不在上海了、這個消息已屬確實了、但導師先生的佳音、純至今没有接到、</p>

<h3>紐約職業婦女生活（八）</h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>每星期賺二十元至二十五元的女子、克拉蕾史威廉姆士的一天生活如下、</p>
<p>伊最初的名字、呌做克拉拉、這是應該承認的、伊所認識的女郎多有可愛而呌得響的名字、所以後來她覺得還是用克拉蕾史這個名字、較爲適當、</p>
<p>克拉蕾史在一家紐約大旅館裏充當賣雪茄烟的櫃員、如果伊每月並不預支、那末週底發薪時伊的封袋裏就有二十五元、伊每天工作甚遲、所以這幕生活之劇開塲時、總在上午十點鐘左右、克拉蕾史與她同等地位的一位女郎、合住一處、她們所住的房間很大、這些女子覺得住在西部八十條街還很不錯、她們的房間裏都有流動自來水的裝置、</p>
<p>克拉蕾史的家庭住在紐裘賽、但是數年以前她已經脫離家庭外出、她覺得家庭的可恥、雖然對於他們還有幾分愛心、母親實在太舊式了、爸一天到晚抽著烟斗、别人的事一概不問、尤其對於他吹毛求疵的女兒們、克拉蕾史的第一個職位、原在裘賽城效外的一家糖菓店裏、伊覺得很是滿意、就是住家的環境也很過得去、後來伊遇到一個行旅商人、告訴伊說、她的容貌很美麗、可以當得紐約旅館裏的售物女郎、那裏正在需要有吸引力的女子、在穿堂裏充任此缺、起初克拉蕾史對於這個提議、並不急求實現、伊一生之中祇有一兩次到過紐約大旅館的穿堂裏、伊心裏存著害怕的念頭、恐怕有人要問伊在那裏做什麽、可是這個提議的行旅售貨人、每星期到城裏來、總是重申他的前議、克拉蕾史就問伊、他所薦舉的是那一家旅館、他便爲她寫了一個旅館的名單、那時候離開她决意到紐約去之前、也已經有幾個星期了、某天下半天她决計出發、將她的名字留在幾個旅館裏、其中一家正在要人、他們先要和别的女子見面、然後再給回音於伊、克拉蕾史或是克拉拉、那時她所呌的、是很奇異當她接著一封信、呌她星期一去上工、她的父母對於此舉不很贊同、克拉拉願意繼續住在家裏、每天趕上紐約去做工、父母們所喜悅的、就是她一星期的工資、已從十二元升至十八元了、</p>
<p>三年之中、她的薪水增加至二十五元一星期、職務還是和從前相同、伊已經離開家庭、使伊雙親驚異不止、現在她已成爲一個老紐約了、</p>
<p>在這個特殊的早晨、伊留戀床第、不肯卽起、可是必須在十二點鐘上旅館、並且還有幾件襯衫和襪要洗、早飯也得自己去調查、所以她不得不起床燃着了「史得諾」煑水和咖啡、她所用的咖啡、稍煑就可吃的、一罐牛乳、一塊麵包、幾棵牛酷、和一些咕咕餅、都是昨夜吃剩的、放在小桌子上堂早飯吃、她同住的伴侣早已出去做事了、</p>
<p>克拉蕾史於進早膳洗衣之後、方始穿着衣服、她很細心的梳洗裝扮、最初用粉將臉面擦凈、其後依次用光面霜、胭脂、乾粉、唇膏、眉筆等種種化裝品、臨了始用細粉薄施於面、她對自己的臉面要仔細地察看、「面如桃花乳酷」、有許多人贊伊、她不但用功化裝、還費上不少的金錢去保持她的顔色、使無瑕疵、</p>
<p>時間過得很快、克拉蕾史急促地收拾她床舖、一方面還在整理房間、否則伊曉得同住的伴侣要發怒的、不過她也不十分管伊同伴的事、總之伊願意收拾則罷、不然也就任之而已、</p>
<p>她穿一件緊身的假皮短褂、這是她得意的衣着、戴的帽子也很緊小、一條羽飾直拖到面頰、穗花鞋跟的便鞋和極薄的襪、完竟她全部看得見的裝束、</p>
<p>克拉蕾史喜歡坐第五愛文義的公共汽車上工、車資一　幣零、她覺得也很合算、搭乘公共汽車較坐地道車體面多了、伊很喜歡想像坐在私有的轎式汽車裏、一路疾駛而去、</p>
<p>克拉蕾史工作的一家旅館、顧客的種類廣泛而衆多、從外城來的富人常常住在亭個旅館裏、因爲到大商店和戲院子罪常便利、銷售巨商也視這個旅館爲總部、各城鎭的商店採貨員也都匯集在這個地方、進進出出忙碌非常、（未完）</p>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昂若譯</p>
<p>前在五月一二兩日阿伯費會議、協約國政府已把五六兩月運輸美軍至法的大綱决定、</p>
<p>協約國政府復於六月二日在凡爾賽會議、請米爾納侯爵·潘興司令·及我自己提出七月份美軍運送的計劃、我們便成立了協定、承認六月份的儘先運輸步兵、現更主張七月份依照原來計劃進行、七月裏因須有步兵及機關槍隊十四萬人開到法國、</p>
<p>最高軍事評議會非但批准了這協定、且表示更望美國在一九一九年八月份供給軍隊一百師、每月至少招募三十萬人、這樣、協約國方得維持兵額上的優勢、以至獲得最後的勝利、</p>
<p>潘興司令對於聯軍向美國的呼籲卽有具體的表示、六月九日、德國第十九軍正向香本方面進攻的時候、美國遠征軍司令來到明朋看我、重新表現其三月廿八日的意思、他懇切的對我說、他完全與聯軍取一致行動、他切望他的部隊掃數參加戰事、同時、他實在是代表美國一致的民氣、他說美國决心全力參戰、犧牲若何在所不計、</p>
<p>這種民氣的表現、對於協約國政府的軍事很有利益、可惜物質上的阻磚使美國的合作受了限止、不幸這些障碍很有關係、六月十四日我條陳内閣總理、申說這點的重要、</p>
<p>我在條陳裏面討論一九一八年下半年美軍運法的計劃應成立的基礎、我一面希望大隊美軍開到法國、一面指出足以阻碍其實現的種種原因、如船只·馬匹·以及軍備等等、因須有「各部細心的初步的研究、以及政府間的協調、以成立確定的數實、」</p>
<p>我以内閣總理的許可、遂會同泰狄歐君進行研究、並根據下例的基礎擬定一個計劃、</p>
<p>聯軍要在一九一九年處於有把握的决勝地位、定須佔着超過德軍二百廿或二百四十師的兵額的優勢、就是要在一九一九年七月開到美軍八十師、</p>
<p>要使美軍在上船之前有三個月的訓練、一九一九年四月開到的最後一部、必須由一九一八年十二月招募的兵士編成、每師須有四萬一千人、因此一九一八年下半年六個月及一九一九年士半年四個月裏、至少要招募三十萬人、</p>
<p>這計劃在六月廿三日希孟會議由潘興司令認可、七月二日提交凡爾賽最高軍事評議會批准後、轉達威爾遜總統、他卽答復一九一九年七月一日可有美軍一百師、到必要的時候、再令其他部隊動員</p>
<p>船只爲主要的困難問題、第一因爲美國商船的努力、（註戰爭結束的時候、美國軍隊所用的船只有三百八十萬噸、美軍開始參戰時不過九萬四千噸、）第二因爲英國海軍司令的帮助、這問題遂得次第解决、</p>
<p>惟美軍源源的增加、（註·一九一八年六月中旬、在美江兩處的美軍增至四十二師、共計一百七十四萬七千人）、潘興司令更爲切望編成獨立部隊、七月十日、他來看我、要求卽把法軍防區的美軍、編成獨立軍團、並請供給砲隊、如屬必要、卽從法軍抽調、</p>
<p>我這次更以懇切的意思告愬潘興司令道、無人比我更加切望編成美軍獨立部隊、致使美軍得以單獨作戰、我正爲這事全力進行、我深信任何一國的軍人、惟有在他們自己的領袖之下及他們自己的旗幟之下、纔肯死力作戰、因這是民族自身榮辱所繫、不幸缺乏大砲、遂使美軍砲隊的供給發生問題、否則美軍獨立部隊便可編成了、</p>
<p>聯軍目的在於得着兵額上的優勢、苟抽出法軍砲隊以補美軍的不足、未必有利於聯軍、反之、美軍没有砲隊、苟用之於平靜區域、接替法軍、以便法軍調開助戰、則大有臂助了、</p>
<p>美軍的協助不是單單限於西線、</p>
<p>六月十七日、布列斯司令爲着米爾納侯爵請求威爾遜總統派遣美軍四千人赴慕曼斯克及亞安其爾的事情、來到朋朋看我、</p>
<p>威爾遜總統半爲謹愼半爲不願减少美軍兵額及調往法線起見、遂無意接受米爾納侯爵的建議、</p>
<p>但在六天之後、我得悉德軍已從俄境抽調幾師赴法、遂亦電告威爾遜總統、謂這事實可認爲「聯軍亟應開往西比里亞的有力的軍事根據、」六月二十七日、我在拍給美總統的第二電裏、再爲注重這點、且要求他卽令美軍兩團調往西比里亞、</p>
<p>七月二日、這問題於最高評議會在凡爾賽開會的時候提出、全部事件遂由協約國政府首領研究、</p>
<p>因欲確定各軍在聯軍最高司令之下編制和維持起見、聯帥的職權須逐漸擴充、以至達到協約各國的内部、及包括戰區的全部、　倫會議的方式遂加擴大、</p>
<p>但在各處戰事在酣之際、西線仍不失爲决戰的區域、西線自頁石爾河口以至畢亞夫河口、廣漠無垠、盡入其範圍、</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>法境的戰事固所重視、意大利戰區的重要也不能漠然置之、因爲阿爾帕山兩面戰事的發展、彼此足以引起反響、　　第一步聯軍不能在意境挫折、第二步從速給以獲勝的機會、阿伯費會議决定由我擔任意大利戰區的軍務、我卽以此爲方針、</p>
<p>一九一八年七月中旬、兩軍勢均力敵的時候快到了、假使敵軍不來攻擊、我軍大舉進攻的時期便告成熟、假使敵人先行進入、我軍便可乘機可攻、</p>
<p>七月九日、我訓令貝當司令、第十軍取攻勢的時候、另在馬爾納河與里姆間進攻、以壯聲勢、這方面的攻勢戰、由裴斯樂司令指揮法國第五軍向敵軍東翼進擊、</p>
<p>七月十三日、我把這計劃的大綱函告法軍總司令、其時他正在配置大戰的兵力、</p>
<p>第一戰—遏制敵軍的前進—所須要的軍隊、多數正在開到、這兵力仍可增加、第二戰—反攻—除其本身的利益之外、還好成爲很有效力的防禦方法、這一戰須極神速的調用全部兵力、方克有濟、</p>
<p>七月十四日午後、我再往貝當司令的總司令部、卽行决定法軍反攻以敵香本方面德軍的進擊、德軍的攻擊似已逼在眉睫、</p>
<p>這次反攻的準備已研究了好幾星期、前敵各部調到的隊伍、齊集以及佈陣、幾須四天工夫、假使這些隊伍抽調開了的防線、此時遇着敵軍乘虛而攻、乃就十分危險、</p>
<p>然而我仍下令七月十四日開始準備、當天因爲香本方面德軍的進攻、有箭在弦上一觸卽發之勢、遂在普樂温同貝當司令商定反攻的準備在十八日完成、敵軍進攻卽行還擊、</p>
<p>我軍準備正在進行的時候、七月四日在凡爾賽所舉行的最高戰事評議會會議席上、發生一種不安定的空氣、那天向晚、午後會議正要結束的時候、勞合喬治君提出一個英文的動議、後來卽載入議事錄、由克萊孟沙君以法國政府的名義表示接受、這議案的内容是第一恢復凡兩賽委員會、第二組成這委員會的軍事代表恢復其監察聯軍作戰計劃的權利、結果便把聯軍總司令一切决定計劃的獨權及其施行的自由完全取消了、</p>
<p>這議案譯成法文後、我便得悉其意義、這議案的嚴重性似未爲評議會委員所注意、我遂往巴黎見克萊孟沙君、我告愬他、我不能接受這議案、且不能在現狀下繼續指揮聯軍、我們於是同回凡爾賽招尋勞合喬治君、他正預備同屬地代表晚餐、我們卽與英首相開始討論、重新擬一草案、由我保留决定作戰計劃的全權、祇向各國政府首領負責、各國軍事代表如欲提出關於指揮戰事的任何建議、須先行向我取得同意、</p>
<p>這時敵軍準備着着進行、七月十四日、法軍一度襲擊、擒獲俘虜廿七人、詢問之下、俘虜供稱、德軍準備在十四十五夜間進攻、半夜後十分鐘開始砲擊云、</p>
<p>我軍反攻準備及反攻砲火卽在德軍開砲之前、沿着中部軍的全綫開始活動、我軍先發制人、更以多數初次出現的無數大砲一齊轟擊、敵大駭、</p>
<p>然而敵仍依照其原定計劃、進行不懈、到了預定的鐘點、敵軍砲隊卽行開火、在上午四時十五分及五時三十分之間、德軍步兵、實行沿着鐵里與麥西奇間綿亘五十六哩之全綫、向我軍衝鋒、按兵未動的惟有里姆突角、里姆之東、幸得裘賴德司令應付得當、敵軍遂未能前進、敵軍縱隊在没有衝到法國第四軍的幹綫之前、卽被我軍濃密的準確的砲火以及散佈前哨綫的機關槍的掃射所擊破、當天德軍幾次肉搏進取這道防綫、卒歸失敗了、</p>
<p>里姆之西、我軍不很順利、在第五軍前綫、敵人於馬爾納河及安得爾河之間、向着意坡内方面進展甚速、第五軍的中路（法軍第五聯隊及意軍第二聯隊）被擊退至第二綫、同時敵在杜爾曼的東西兩面渡過馬爾納河、驅逐了南岸的前哨、並對着法國第五軍左翼及第六軍右翼所駐防的馬里康布列賽聖安格能之綫、佈置了護橋陣綫、</p>
<p>十五日的一天、各軍的後備隊以及總預備隊的各師、幾於悉數開入火綫迎敵、晚上、貝當司令餘留在第四軍的後防的不過步兵一師及騎兵一師、在第五軍後方的也祗一師之衆、</p>
<p>如此、德軍的進攻、雖在我第四軍的前線停頓了、但在第五軍的前綫及第五第六兩軍的交接點、已經得着勝利、這裏敵人攻破了我軍防線、甚至於已在杜爾曼渡過了馬爾納河、這個局部的勝利、否將成爲敵軍乘勝動摇附近防線及阻止我軍實行反攻計劃的先聲、我軍反攻的準備尚須兩天工夫、是否將因此變更計劃、這便是七月十五日的緊急問題、見着敵人兵力雄厚進展迅速、我軍絶無猶豫的餘地、</p>
<p>香本方面戰綫長廿五哩、敵軍失敗了、在杜爾曼渡過馬爾納河的德軍戰綫長十二哩、兩處戰綫相距有十八哩之遙、中間爲里姆要邑及隣近的孟泰尼城所隔、兩地仍爲我軍所扼守、在我軍完成反攻準備尚須的廿四小時裏、敵人在馬爾納河方面難望乘勝解决戰事、</p>
<p>另一方面、我軍準備完竣、便可從愛斯南河至馬爾納河、以廿五哩長之戰綫、乘其不備全力側擊、使敵軍所獲的勝利全功盡棄、成敗關鍵在於我軍毅然决然的根據原來計劃、抱定先發制人的戰略、在愛斯南河與馬爾納河間實行反攻、同時、對於隨時隨地可以發生的危險、嚴加警備、是爲我軍作戰的上策、</p>
<p>我因在十五那天、用全副精神指揮這次軍事、</p>
<p>法軍總司令雖則同我有一樣的信念、因他同實際戰事接觸更密、對於德軍在馬爾納河南岸向意坡内方面前進遂特别關心、他想把反攻準備展緩、以便調用預備反攻的軍隊抵禦目前的形勢、</p>
<p>我在前往莫喜與海格總指揮會見的途中、曾在諾亞地方福悅司令的司令部停留、得悉這個計劃、我遂立卽通知總司令部、這計劃必須糾正、反攻準備萬難延誤、</p>
<p>但見著法軍總司令的合理的憂慮、我便請海格總指揮派遣英軍兩師開往法綫、這樣、在法綫的英軍合前開兩師共成四師之衆、海格總指揮允之、英軍第十三及第三十四兩師遂向法綫開拔、</p>
<p>英軍兩師、原屬英軍第十二聯隊、遂調歸貝當司令支配、增援中部軍的前綫暫取守勢、這兩師兵在疴亞斯河域區下車駐紮、聽我調遣、或以增援法國第十或第六軍採取攻勢、或則帮助法國第三軍取守勢、</p>
<p>這樣、防守方面逼切的須要有了補救、我軍反攻的準備得以進行無阻、而配置於反攻的兵力也得增加了、（未完）</p>

<p>(Jinan) Han Fuju took office in Jinan on the 25th as the Commander of the General Reserve Group Army for Suppressing the Communist Army, and issued the following circular telegram: To all newspaper offices, please note that I have received a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, appointing Han Fuju as the Commander of the General Reserve Group Army for Suppressing the Communist Army, etc. I respectfully took office at the Jinan Military Command on the 25th of this month. At a time when the country is in turmoil and the Red disaster is spreading, I vow to strictly abide by orders, serve as a pioneer, eliminate the fierce and stubborn, and uphold unity. However, I am aware that my talent is limited and my responsibilities are heavy, and I am deeply concerned about failure. I hope that you will provide guidance at any time to correct my shortcomings.

He opposed fighting casually. Now there is Tang Yaoxun's brigade in southern Shandong, and the 20th Division on the Jiaoji Railway. There are no problems with security in the province, so do not believe rumors. After the speech, the army returned to Pingyuan in the original train. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Han Ma Reply to Zhang Yang's Telegram</h3>
<p>Will Certainly Strive to Fulfill Duty</p>
<p>Dare Not Harm Public Justice with Private Feelings</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuju and others replied to Vice Zhang's telegram on the 25th, saying, "After reading Vice Secretary Yang's secret telegram, Shi Yusan's three-pronged attack on northern Henan reveals his rebellious plot. We have instructed our troops to advance and suppress him on a set date. The words are stern and righteous, enough to inspire the officers and soldiers to quell the chaos and save the country, and to intimidate the rebels. Upon investigation, Shi Yusan moved his troops, and the Central Government and Your Excellency have been broad-minded, accommodating him in every way, and not resorting to military force. It can be said that we have been benevolent and righteous to the utmost. When he recruited soldiers and allocated funds, Fuju and others also earnestly advised him with the old friendship of comrades-in-arms, urging him to quickly get out of the maze, but he turned a deaf ear and acted willfully. Now that the truth is clear, we should follow the Central Government and Your Excellency's旨(zhǐ) to eliminate internal strife and guarantee unity, strive to fulfill our duty, maintain peace and serve the party and the country, and dare not harm public justice with private feelings. I respectfully reply to this, and I beg Your Excellency's inspection. Your subordinates Han Fuju, Ma Hongkui, Liu Zhennian, Sun Tongxuan, Cao Fulin, Gu Liangmin, Qiao Lizhi, kowtow together." (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Fan Pujiang, who passed through Jinan from Tai'an and returned to Beiping today, told me that Ma Hongkui said that although his personal friendship with Shi was very deep, Shi is now indulging in personal feelings and undermining unity, so I can only obey the orders of the Commander-in-Chief. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Ma and Liu Zhennian, as well as all the officers under their command, sent a joint telegram in response to Vice Zhang. It can be sent out tonight. The general idea is to follow the Commander-in-Chief</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>and Vice Commander, to maintain peace and unity. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fan Pujiang, who was previously ordered by Zhang Xueliang to go to Jinan to visit Han and report on his situation, has now returned to Beiping. According to his conversation, Han Fuju expressed his willingness to do his best to support the Central Government, and was very dissatisfied with Shi's current rebellion. Ma Hongkui said that Shi Yusan dared to rebel while Chairman Chiang was in Jiangxi suppressing the Communists and the Vice Commander was ill, undermining peace. Although my personal relationship with Han Commander is not bad, Shi's rebellion is clear, so I should unite with Han to suppress Shi and never harm the public interest for personal gain. Cao Fulin's troops under Han are currently stationed in the Linqing Dezhou area. The 20,000 troops of my headquarters are concentrated in Tai'an awaiting orders. Once the Central Army is properly deployed, we will launch a two-pronged attack on Shi's troops to achieve success in one fell swoop. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Hu Ruoyu, who was previously ordered to go to Jinan to meet Han Fuju, has returned to Qingdao.

<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Peide told reporters on the morning of the 26th that the suppression of the Communists in Jiangxi was winning victories one after another, and the bandits were trying to flee to Fujian, but Fujian had been prepared for a long time, and it would not be difficult to annihilate them. Shi's rebellion was actually in collusion with the Communist bandits, and his political workers were mostly Communist Party members. Northern generals such as Han Fuju had advised Shi repeatedly out of personal friendship, but Shi did not heed their advice. Now Han has declared his support for the Central Government, and the Jin generals and Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, and others all despise Shi's fickle nature and have unanimously requested to suppress him, and are confident in stopping the rebellion. (26th Special Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Generals From All Sides Unanimously Respond to the Suppression of Shi</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Sen sent a telegram on the 25th, saying that Shi Yusan's rebellion and fickleness were helping the imperialists and the Communist bandits, and were the common enemy of the entire nation. He vowed to denounce him together with all the soldiers and comrades in the country, in order to eliminate this morning meal. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Guitang, commander of the newly編(biān) Sixth Brigade, telegraphed from Daming, declaring that Shi Yusan's telegram falsely listed his name, and that he himself absolutely obeyed the orders of the Commander-in-Chief and was loyal to the party and the country, and dared not fall behind others. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Nanchang said that the northern generals sent a joint telegram to Chiang on the 25th, requesting a fundamental solution to the Shi rebellion. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun, He Jian, Xu Yuanquan and other thirty-three generals telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, responding to the Shi Yang telegram, hoping to encourage the soldiers to encircle and annihilate them, and that they would also practice military affairs here and denounce them unanimously. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tianjin-Pukou Transportation Blocked</h3>

<h3>Wanpaoshan Case: Protest to Japan Remains Unanswered</h3>
<p>Zhong Yu Requests Instructions on How to Deal With It</p>
<p>Wang Rongbao Leaves Shenyang for Beiping</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the note on the Wanpaoshan case was sent out, as of the 26th, the Japanese side has not yet responded. It is reported that the Japanese side believes that the Wan case is a local event, and insists on resolving it directly by the local authorities. It has ordered Lin Kyujiro, the Japanese Consul General stationed in Liaoning, to negotiate directly with Zhong Yu, our special commissioner in Jilin. Zhong recently telegraphed to Nanjing, saying that the Japanese police have not yet withdrawn, and the Korean farmers in Wanpaoshan continue to work. Please give instructions on how to deal with it as soon as possible. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jilin) At this afternoon's meeting of the Diplomatic Office, Zhong Yu said that only our side could raise the issue of damage in the Wan case, and that Japan's fundamental error was that it could not seek compensation from us. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Right Wing Army Formally Occupies Donggu in Suppressing the Communists</h3>
<p>He Orders Rear Troops to Assist in Suppression</p>
<p>All Important Bandit Leaders Are in Ruijin</p>

The bandits fled in panic towards Jianchang Ruijin, corpses littered the fields. In addition to comforting the people, our army also sent the Jiang and Cai divisions to track and pursue them.

<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Nanchang said: 1. According to an airplane report, Xiang Ping returned to Jiangxi from Fujian, and all important bandit leaders are in Ruijin. The defeated bandits from Ningdu, fearing that Donggu would be cut off, retreated to the southeastern border of Jiangxi and gathered with the bandits in western Fujian in Ruijin Huichang.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Emergency Relief for Floods</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been many days of continuous rain. Mountain torrents have erupted, and rivers have surged. East, west, north, and south, floods have overflowed. Where raging waves have struck, people and animals have been swept away, and houses have been destroyed. The cruelty of the situation and the urgent need for rescue have been briefly described by the reporter in a previous commentary. At the same time, an earnest and urgent appeal has been made on behalf of the flood-affected compatriots. Currently, the continuous rain continues unabated, the floodwaters are increasing, the disaster is becoming more serious, and the disaster area is expanding day by day, with almost half of our country's land becoming a swamp. In recent days, telegrams reporting disasters and appeals for relief have been flying in like snowflakes from various provinces and regions, with tragic cries and tears of blood. If we try to close our eyes and think silently, a vast ocean fills the mountains and valleys, countless compatriots drift with the waves, the living wait for death, and the dead are exposed. This horrific and inhuman situation should immediately appear before us. Who has no parents? Who has no children? The dead are dead, but those waiting for death still have a breath and have not given up hope. Floating in the flood, crying to the heavens and shedding tears of blood, thinking about this tragic situation, unless we have hearts of iron, how can we not shed tears? The National Government decided the other day to allocate 30,000 yuan for emergency relief to the disaster areas near the capital. However, the disaster near the capital is relatively light. The disaster in other areas is ten or a hundred times more serious than in the area near the capital, and it is impossible to calculate. Although we cannot see it with our eyes, we have ears to hear and brains to think. The tragedy of the flood is greater than other disasters, and its urgency is even like a hanging thread. Therefore, saving one moment earlier can reduce the death of thousands of lives, and saving one day earlier can save millions of lives. Gathering the strength of the people of the whole country and jointly seeking emergency relief, and even seeking good follow-up, is something that cannot be delayed at this time. The reporter would like to offer a few points within his knowledge. First, the Relief Committee should urgently prepare for emergency relief. The Relief Committee has handled disaster relief over the years with remarkable results. Although there are still some plans that cannot be realized due to the country's finances, the committee has worked hard and persistently, and has been respected by the people of the country. In the face of this emergency, it should especially implement its original intention and urgently prepare for emergency relief. How to donate boats, wooden boards, food, worn clothes, and medicines of all sizes, and how to distribute and transport them, should all be planned urgently. The disaster victims waiting for death are already eagerly expecting it. Second, the people of the country should unanimously tighten their belts and donate to emergency relief. Helping each other in times of emergency is everyone's responsibility. Moreover, in the face of this unprecedented catastrophe, when the earth is submerged, how can we bear to sit idly by and not provide assistance? We live in cities and are fortunate not to have been affected by the disaster. However, after days of continuous rain, we still feel depressed. How much more so for those who are drifting with the waves, cold and hungry, with a boundless view and no way out? Putting ourselves in their place, what will be their desire for rescue? At this point, the people of the country should have a heart of hunger and thirst, and unanimously tighten their belts. Those with money should donate money, and those without money should donate worn clothes, scraps, food, medicines, wooden boards, etc. Whatever the victims urgently need is waste to us, but it can be exchanged for life for the victims. Donating one share can save one person, and donating ten shares can save ten people. Gathering the power of the masses will have a greater effect. Automatic donation will be even faster. Third, charitable organizations should cooperate fully. In past disaster relief efforts, charitable organizations mostly did not communicate with each other and had no overall planning to carefully implement relief efforts. Therefore, efforts were often doubled but the results were halved. This emergency relief should be non-partisan and cooperate fully to carry out planned and systematic actions, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Fourth, the health administrative agencies should prepare in advance to prevent epidemics in the disaster area. When floods overflow, people and animals are swept away, bodies are exposed, and germs breed. After the flood passes, the sun evaporates, causing epidemics. This is inevitable. Moreover, the survivors in the disaster area are suffering from hunger and cold and are being submerged by water, and diseases are rampant, which is unavoidable. Therefore, health administrative agencies should urgently prevent this as soon as possible and instruct the local governments in the disaster area to work together, lest it break out and spread throughout the country, making it more difficult to remedy. Fifth, the Central Food Committee should urgently investigate and prepare. This disaster area is vast, and the image of future famine has already formed. If we do not seek remedies early, food will be scarce, and hungry people will be everywhere. Therefore, the Food Committee should urgently: (1) investigate the flooded fields; (2) estimate the food shortage after the disaster; (3) prepare food in advance, such as using surplus soybeans from the Northeast, absorbing foreign rice and wheat, and conducting an investigation to clarify and accumulate enough reserves. Then, make an overall calculation and allocate it properly, so that the old and weak will not die in ditches and the strong will not wander on the road. All of these five are urgent tasks that should be implemented effectively. The reason why we save people today is the reason why we save ourselves in the future. If the people of the country have other good plans and policies, we hope that they will urgently discuss them together.</p>

<h3>The Military Counselor's Office Plans to Establish a Military Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The three departments of the National Government, the Civilian Officer Department, has jurisdiction over three bureaus, and the Accounting Department has jurisdiction over three bureaus.

As for the General Headquarters and the General Camp, they are both temporary agencies. The National Government should set up an agency for military affairs, and it is proposed to set up a Military Affairs Bureau, which is directly under the Military Counselor's Office. He's visit to Jiangxi to see Chiang may be related to this matter. However, since it is related to the amendment of the National Government Organization Law, it should be submitted to the Central Political Council for approval, and then to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval. It will probably be implemented soon. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Mexican President Orders Revision of Currency Law</h3>
<p>Recalling Gold Coins to Relieve Silver Coins</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Mexico City, 25th: Both houses of the Mexican Congress today passed a presidential decree to revise the currency law, recalling gold pesos circulating in the market and leaving only silver pesos in circulation. This new currency law and presidential decree will be announced and take effect on Monday, the 27th. The presidential decree also revises the organizational law of the Bank of Mexico, allowing the bank to issue banknotes up to twice the amount of gold and foreign currency it holds. These banknotes will be used at full value according to silver pesos. Previously agreed gold peso loans among the people will henceforth be repaid with silver pesos and banknotes converted accordingly. According to recent silver peso exchange rates, which are only 60% or 70% of the value of gold pesos, the decree stipulates that gold peso deposits in banks can only be paid 30% in gold coins, and the remainder in silver coins, converted at the actual price of gold coins. However, since gold coins are no longer legal tender, people will be forced to sell all gold coins they own. The conversion rate between gold and silver coins will be determined later.</p>

<h3>German Banking Industry Cooperates Amid Economic Panic</h3>
<p>Jointly Establishing a Receiving Bank</p>
<p>Run on Banks Can Be Avoided Hereafter</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 26th: Today, Germany's largest banks, in order to cope with the financial crisis, are jointly forming an acceptance, mortgage and guarantee bank with a capital of 200 million marks, and each bank is following the motto of mutual dependence. After the order restricting deposits is revoked, they are obliged to help each other, with the Deutsche Bank as their backing. It is reported that the initial intention of this agreement was to protect a large bank in distress, but it is believed that its role can guarantee the safety of the financial sector. Since the news of the organization of the acceptance, mortgage and guarantee bank was announced, the Deutsche Bank immediately announced that its Saturday balance sheet showed that its cash reserve of banknotes had increased from 0.3% to 361%. It is now believed in banking circles that the discount rate may be raised from 10% to 15% at the Deutsche Bank's board meeting tomorrow, because the bills discounted by the bank have increased from 18.69 million marks to 86.37 million marks.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 25th: Several British bankers will discuss the necessary measures to reorganize Germany's short-term debt with key figures from the German National Bank and other institutions on Sunday. According to the opinions of important bankers, the resumption of normal banking operations is only possible if the run on banks stops. They acknowledge that credit can only be restored after the National Bank's restrictions are relaxed again, but the banking restrictions will not be relaxed until foreign creditors notify the bank that they will not withdraw their short-term debts within a certain period of time. The Securities Exchange Council has now agreed to extend the payment of debts due at the end of July to the end of August, so a large amount of cash will not be withdrawn from the banks for the time being. The banks are now gradually hoping that a permanent recovery will begin.</p>
<h3>France Absorbs Cash</h3>
<p>Aimed at Disrupting Plans to Help Germany</p>
<p>India Sells Silver, Greatly Tightening the Market</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Paris, 25th: Today, the Bank of France announced that its gold reserves are worth 578.96 million francs, including 125 million francs worth of gold imported last week. Banking circles in Paris claim that France will continue to purchase gold in London while the exchange rate of the pound sterling is extremely favorable.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 25th: The British have suspected from the beginning that France intends to put British finances in a dangerous situation, and unfortunately, this suspicion is gradually being confirmed. The only topic of conversation in London today is the export of British gold coins to France and the withdrawal of French capital from Britain. According to the London Herald, the total amount of French debt investment in Britain is 140 million pounds, but since the German financial crisis occurred, one-third of the total amount has now been withdrawn. The Labour Party newspaper said that France's actions are to prevent Britain from helping Germany, because France has not forgotten its policy of subjugating Germany to French political conditions. The Daily Telegraph said that France has used this strategy several times in the past at the Hague Conference and the Disarmament Conference to resist situations unfavorable to France. However, the best course of action now is to find a way to prevent France's actions from becoming a disaster for the whole of Europe.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 25th: Special silver sales are currently underway in London.

(Note: The price of silver today fell by .3125, probably due to large-scale sales in London.)</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 26th: The price of silver fell sharply today for both near and far terms. The near-term price today is 12 pence and 11/16, down .3125 from yesterday's 13 pence. The far-term price today is also 12 pence and 11/16, down .25 from yesterday's 12 pence and 15/16.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Spain Remains Unstable</h3>
<p>Revolutionary Troops in Seville Clash with Militias</p>
<p>Three Leaders Executed</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Madrid, 24th: After 24 hours of calm, a sudden change occurred in Seville this morning. Hundreds of revolutionary troops suddenly attacked the militia barracks, and the sound of artillery fire shook the entire city. The latest tactic of the revolutionary troops is to drive women and children to the front, with themselves following behind. However, as soon as the women and children approached the front, they scattered like birds and beasts, allowing the militia's machine guns to fire directly at the revolutionary troops. Many revolutionary troops were killed, forcing them to retreat. Afterwards, 19 bodies were found lying in the streets, and the revolutionary troops carried away even more themselves. The authorities have now decided to declare a state of emergency. Three revolutionary leaders have been arrested, sentenced to death by military law, and have already been executed. Residents are forbidden from going out. Anyone leaving their homes must raise both hands, otherwise they risk being killed. Machine guns have now been set up at all major street corners, and armored vehicles are patrolling the streets incessantly. Fearing that the revolutionary troops will fire from the rooftops, multiple aircraft have been dispatched to fly at low altitude to scout the rooftops. This situation is likely to spread to other industrial areas, causing the Madrid central government great concern. It is heard that an order will be issued to show the determination to suppress the rampant flames of anarchism and the union system.</p>
<h3>World Aviation News</h3>
<p>▲ High-Speed Race Around Britain</p>
<p>Edwards Wins the Trophy</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 25th: The 982-mile race around Britain was won today by Royal Air Force officer Edwards, who won the trophy. His private aircraft was a "碧禽" (likely "Beagle") type. Although he started one hour and forty minutes later than others, he was the first to fly back, with an average speed of 117 miles per hour. The second place was also an air force officer, named 吉白生 (likely "Gibbison"), with a speed of 109 miles per hour. Another air force officer, 羅德 (likely "Rhodes"), although not the first to reach the destination, had the highest speed, at 127 miles per hour, and won a prize of 100 pounds. It is noted that four air force officers participated in the competition in private aircraft. They are accustomed to soaring in the sky in bad weather. Today happened to be a climate of dense, wet clouds, making flying difficult, so the air force officers were able to show their strengths and win. Six women signed up to compete, but five of them withdrew due to the poor weather.</p>

<h3>Protectionist Tariffs are in Vogue</h3>
<p>The Free Trade System is About to Disappear</p>
<p>Only Our Country, Subject to Domination, is an Exception</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo News: According to the Trade Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry, since 1929, the world economic panic has gradually developed, and countries are competing to adopt protectionist tariff policies, increasing import tariffs. In the past one or two years, as many as 24 countries have revised their tariffs, and the amount of tax rates is unprecedented in history. The highest rates even reach 90%, which is no longer a protective tariff, but can be called a prohibitive tariff. The lowest tariff barriers are all small and weak countries under the domination of great powers, such as China and Egypt. Other sovereign countries have raised tariffs, such as Persia, Turkey, and the Hejaz, which have implemented protective tariffs this summer. The free trade system is about to disappear from the earth. (World)</p>

<h3>Telegram from Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>To all newspapers: We recently replied to Chairman Liu of Kaifeng and all comrades with the following telegram: To Chairman Liu of Kaifeng and all comrades, we have received the insightful telegram. Your uncovering of traitors and your forthrightness and sternness are assets to the Party and the country, and admired by all. Now that the communist flames are rampant and the diplomatic situation is urgent, it is a time for patriots to be heartbroken and for comrades to be ready to fight.

Such a blatant disregard for morality shows that they are isolating themselves from the people. You have declared the great righteousness, rectified discipline, and carefully selected your mentors to launch a punitive expedition. Your reputation has spread far and wide, uniting the masses of Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and Zhao, and first achieving success. With a thunderous sound, the demons and ghosts will be revealed and their traces will disappear. We, Yifei, and others, are eager to serve the country and are determined to save the times.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Recent Military News from the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>▲Shi's Situation Is Isolated</p>
<p>▲The Situation on the Jinpu Railway Is Normal</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: In recent days, due to the actions of Shi Yousan's troops, the situation here is changing from defensive to offensive. The pre-arranged military plan for the Pinghan Railway is that south of Shijiazhuang, there are no dangerous terrain to rely on, so the Northeast Army abandoned Shijiazhuang. Shi's vanguard is composed of the three divisions of Sun Guangqian, Shen Ke, and Sun Tielin. The troops that entered Shijiazhuang yesterday were part of Shen Ke's division. It is rumored that Shi Yousan himself has arrived in Gaoyi. Yu Xuezhong, the commander of the Northeast First Army, departed from Beiping the day before yesterday and arrived in Baoding yesterday. The headquarters is located in Guangyuan, commanding the Pinghan military operations. On the Jinpu Railway, passenger and freight trains have been running as usual in recent days. The Northeast previously stationed a brigade under Ding Xichun and a cavalry brigade under Li Fuhe in the northern section of the railway. Now, reinforcements have been added, and the strength is extremely abundant. Up to Sangyuan in the south, Wang Shuchang is still planning everything at the Deputy Commander's headquarters in Beiping because the situation has been stable recently. According to those familiar with military affairs, Shi's military actions were originally planned to coincide with those of Sun Dianying and others, but Sun and others have already declared their stance, supporting the central government. The Shanxi generals are especially obedient to Deputy Commander Zhang and are determined to remain loyal. Shi's situation has become isolated and is destined to fail without saying so. In Tianjin, fearing that reactionary elements would take the opportunity to act, martial law was declared the day before yesterday. Commander Zhang Xueming and Deputy Commander Guo Dianju have both arrived in Tianjin. The location is temporarily borrowed from the rear building of the Public Security Bureau as the office of the martial law headquarters, and Dong Peiqing has been appointed as the chief of the staff, Wu Yixian as the chief of the secretariat, Wang Yimin as the chief of the garrison, Sun Shaokang as the chief of the enforcement department, Lu Lu as the chief of the inspection department, and Tao Weiduo as the chief of the adjutant department. The content is divided into six departments, and most of the staff are concurrently filled by personnel from the Public Security Bureau. A notice has been issued saying, "Tianjin is a crucial hub connecting the north and south, and an important barrier for Hebei. With convenient transportation and people from all over the world residing here, local peace and stability are crucial to the overall situation. Currently, the situation is unstable, and rumors are rampant, easily causing panic. The citizens are affected by this. We have received instructions from the Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters that Tianjin is a garrison area and that martial law will be implemented immediately. Zhang Xueming has been appointed as the Tianjin Martial Law Commander and Guo Dianju as the Deputy Martial Law Commander, and so on. Upon receiving these instructions, the Commander and Deputy Commander took office in Tianjin on the 22nd of this month. In accordance with the Martial Law Regulations, martial law is announced immediately. During the period of martial law, we will be responsible for the protection of local order, the lives and property of Chinese and foreign people, and the financial and commercial sectors, in order to maintain security. In addition to reporting and distributing this notice, we will detail the implementation measures in accordance with Article 9 of the Martial Law Regulations and announce them to the public. Therefore, we urge all soldiers and civilians to comply with this notice." (23rd)</p>
<h3>Deputy Zhang's Representative Fan Pujiang Comes to Jinan Again</h3>
<p>▲Hu Ruoyu, Jiang Bocheng, and Zhang Yue Also Arrive</p>
<p>▲Fan Talks About the Situation of Shi's Army and the Northeast Army</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Fan Pujiang, representative of Zhang Xueliang, Jiang Bocheng, Chief Counselor of the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Zhang Yue, representative of Han Fuqu, arrived in Jinan at 9:45 AM today (23rd) on the Jinpu Railway. Hu Ruoyu, Mayor of Qingdao, also came on the same train. According to Jiang Bocheng, the situation in the north is very good. Deputy Commander Zhang, in order to ensure that the Commander-in-Chief can suppress the bandits in Jiangxi without worrying about the north, has decided to assume full responsibility for maintaining the overall situation in the north with Chairman Han. If anyone attempts to rebel, they will be eliminated in the shortest possible time. The Deputy Commander has fully recovered from his illness and took a photo with us in the hospital, showing his restored spirit. Fan Pujiang said that recently, because Yu Xuezhong, the Martial Law Commander of Beiping, went to the front to inspect defenses, he took over his duties. He had no time to come to Jinan, but Deputy Commander Zhang repeatedly sent him to thank Chairman Han (Fuqu), General Commander Ma (Hongkui), and Director Wang (Fangting) for sending people to Beiping to inquire about his health and to present gifts as a memento. The gifts for Ma included a complete set of Western silver tableware, a pair of cloisonné vases, a complete set of silver tea sets, a silk carpet (formerly from the Qing Palace collection), a complete set of Southern-style red lacquer stoves, and a set of single-lined robe and gown materials. The gifts for Han included a set of three blue and four-tube silver vases, and the rest were the same as the gifts for Ma. The gifts for Wang Fangting included an ivory carving of eight horses and single-lined robe and gown materials. Jiang Bocheng and Zhang Yue also received gifts. Deputy Commander Zhang and Chairman Han share the responsibility of maintaining the overall situation. Since Chief Counselor Jiang (Bocheng) and Committee Member Zhang (Yue) went to Beiping, their spirit has become more united. Zhang Yue said that the trip was a complete success. The Deputy Commander is determined to cooperate with Chairman Han to the end, and the overall situation in the north is optimistic. Hu Ruoyu said that he had no other mission here and planned to visit Chairman Han before returning to Qingdao. He will talk to everyone in detail when he has the opportunity. After Fan and others left the station, they went to the provincial government by car. Han immediately held a banquet to welcome them and invited Shao Lizi to join them. After the banquet, Hu Ruoyu took the Qingji Railway's military train to Qingdao.</p>
<p>After the banquet at the provincial government, reporters interviewed Fan Pujiang again. According to him, Chairman Han expressed his obedience to the General and Deputy Commanders, consistently and without wavering. Shi Yousan did not listen to Chairman Han's advice, and their friendship has ended. Although Shi still sends telegrams from time to time, Han sometimes ignores them and sometimes replies with a single character "悉" (xi, meaning "understood"), because Shi's rebellious attitude is clear and their personal positions are different. Shi Yousan's telegram to Beiping listed Sun Dianying's name, and Sun's representative in Beiping, Jin Zunhua, has declared on Sun's behalf that Shi fabricated and fabricated the information. The Shanxi generals obey the General and Deputy Commanders, and Fu Shuangying in Taiyuan is on extremely harmonious terms with them. Shi Yousan has arrived in Shijiazhuang, but is afraid to advance further because of the defense of Shanxi. The Northeast Army is now concentrating its troops on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines, waiting quietly. If Shi's army advances again, they will respond accordingly. He plans to go to Tai'an tomorrow (24th) to deliver gifts to General Commander Ma. Because the situation in Beiping is important, he will return to Beiping the day after tomorrow. (23rd)</p>
<h3>New Appointments for Various Generals in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>▲ Han Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the General Reserve Corps</p>
<p>▲ Ma, Sun, and Cao Appointed Commanders of Various Corps</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the Vice Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Shi Yousan, and others telegraphed their dissent, although there is still hope for their ultimate realization, preparations for a punitive expedition must be made to quell the rebellion in the shortest possible time. Furthermore, given the important strategic position of Shandong, it is essential to grant the generals stationed in Shandong appropriate titles to facilitate the command of various armies. Therefore, after consultation, Han Fuju was specially appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the General Reserve Corps for the Suppression of Communists, Ma Hongkui as the Commander of the First Corps, Sun Tongxuan (Commander of the 20th Division) as the Commander of the Second Corps, and Cao Fulin (Commander of the 29th Division) as the Commander of the Third Corps. This order arrived in Jinan on the 22nd.</p>
<p>Previously, Han Fuju, due to military operations on the Pinghan Railway, had clearly demarcated the boundaries. To maintain public order in the province and prevent the intrusion of routed soldiers, he specially dispatched units from the Third and Fifteenth Routes to defend the borders of Shandong. The deployment is gradually nearing completion. Recently, our reporter visited Han, asking about the true situation of the current situation. According to him, Chief of General Staff Jiang (Bocheng) and Committee Member Zhang (Yue) returned to Jinan from Pingjin this morning, and the outcome was extremely satisfactory. Shi's forces are currently in the Shijiazhuang area, and the Jinpu Railway will certainly not experience any changes. The current troop movements in Shandong province are aimed at preventing defeated soldiers from entering the territory. He has always been a lover of peace and a protector of the region. However, since the founding of the Republic of China, internal wars have occurred countless times. If each war led to progress, it would be understandable. However, there has been no progress, and each result has been unfavorable. Even this war, in his opinion, is no different from an old farmer looking at a notice – the common people are destined for bad luck.</p>
<p>Han Fuju, in response to the skillful telegram sent by the Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, Liu Zhi, and 33 other generals denouncing Shi Yousan, sent a reply on the 22nd. The original text is recorded below: "To Chief Commander Liu Jingfu of Kaifeng, Supervisor Liu Xueya of Luoyang, Supervisor Li Xiaodong of Guangshan, Chairman Yang Huchen of Xi'an, Chief Commander Gu Mosan of Zhengzhou, Commander Wang Zhiping of Lanfeng, Chief Commander Ji Shiwu of Guangshan, Chief Commander Liang Zichao of Qingjiang, Chief Commander Zhang Boying of Kaifeng, Chief Commander Liu Shulin of Luoyang, and forwarded to the Commanders of all armies and divisions. I recently received your skillful telegram, stating that with the communist atmosphere unrestrained and foreign aggression intensifying, all of us comrades should work together to uphold unity, save the country from destruction, and seek the survival of the nation. The words are solemn and the righteousness is upright, which makes people indignant. Since I have joined the military, I have made it my goal to maintain peace. The affairs of the country have undergone several changes, but this heart has remained unchanged, and I have vowed to never change it. Moreover, at this critical moment, if anyone is ignorant of the greater good and destroys peace, they should be regarded as a public enemy. I pledge to follow behind you all and proceed in unison to fulfill the original intention of saving the country and the people. As I write this telegram, my thoughts are racing and I cannot express everything I want to say. Please understand. Han Fuju and the commanders of his affiliated divisions and brigades bow in respect." (23rd)</p>
<h3>Wang Jun Heads West Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Solid Defense Around Xuzhou</p>
<p>Xuzhou Express: After Wang Jun was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Third Corps of the Southern Route Group Army, recognizing the need for timely action, he departed Xuzhou this morning (24th) with a contingent of personnel from the Jinpu Garrison Command. The Xuzhou station received notification yesterday and prepared three trains, ready to depart. The first train, a special vehicle for technical troops, and the second train, a military vehicle for the division headquarters, departed successively last night. Wang, due to unfinished business in Xuzhou, only boarded the train at 6:00 AM this morning. Chief of Staff Zhang Jiangui, Secretary Qin Zhenfu, and a contingent of personnel drawn from various departments accompanied Wang. The special train departed at 6:15 AM. The cadre training team lined up at the station, playing music to send them off. Wang said to others that this trip is directly to Xinxiang and that the military action against Shi's army will not pose a significant problem and can be completed in a very short time. The date of return to Xuzhou should not be far off, so the various departments of the garrison command are all left behind in Xuzhou. After Wang's departure to the west, appropriate measures have been taken regarding the issues of the Jinpu Garrison Command and the security of Xuzhou. The duties of the garrison command will be temporarily handled by Chief of General Staff Zhang Jinde. Chief of Staff Qiu Yude will also remain in Xuzhou to assist in all matters. The security of the city is the responsibility of Chen Xueshun, the Director of the Military and Police Supervisory Department. Currently, the defense of Xuzhou is extremely solid. The joint defense conference of the people's militias of the counties along the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, convened by Wang in Xuzhou, is scheduled to be held tomorrow and will be presided over by Chief of General Staff Zhang. A comprehensive plan will be developed for the joint defense of the people's militias of the counties along the railway, from Jiangpu in the south to Lincheng in the north. The defense of the Jinpu Railway is also becoming more solid. As for the Longhai front, the area from Xuzhou to Haizhou has been taken over by Liang Guanying's troops. The area from Xuzhou to Guide has also been taken over by Zhang Lisheng's division, who dispatched cavalry. Therefore, the Longhai route is also extremely secure. (24th)</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Suppression of Bandits in Western Anhui's Lu'an</h3>
<p>Small Victory on the West Bank of the Pi River</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The western territory of Lu'an in western Anhui has been occupied by communist bandits for many years. Despite repeated large-scale suppression campaigns by the National Army, it has not been completely cleared due to its proximity to the communist areas on the Henan border. The communist bandits west of the Pi River have become increasingly rampant in recent months, burning, killing, looting, and turning homes into ruins. Refugees are wandering and displaced, with no homes to return to. Those who have fallen into the bandit areas have mostly died. Fortunately, the National Army is holding the east bank of the Pi River, and the eastern territory of Lu'an has been relatively calm. Previously, when the communist bandits invaded eastward, Yuan Jingfu, the head of the Lu'an Communist Eradication Corps, led his troops across the river to meet them in battle, capturing and killing many. County Magistrate Deng rewarded them with 3,000 yuan to show encouragement. Several days ago, the communist bandits west of the river again attempted to invade eastward but were again jointly suppressed by the Communist Eradication Corps and other anti-communist units who crossed the river. They advanced to places such as Zhangjiaji and Guojiadian, capturing six communist bandits alive, killing more than ten, and seizing more than 200 dan of rice, more than 300 dan of paddy, more than 30 pigs, four rifles, and more than 100 primitive guns and cannons. The captured bandits were executed on the spot. One member of the corps was wounded in the battle. The corps is currently holding firm at Zhangkongji, Guojiadian, and other places, preparing to continue the suppression of bandits in places such as Dingjiaji and Huoxingmiao. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Rampant Activity of the Great Dao Society in Northern Fujian</h3>
<p>▲ Orders Issued to Various Battalions and Teams to Suppress the Society</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The counties in northern Fujian are located in the upper reaches of the Min River, with treacherous shoals and steep mountains, making transportation difficult and the people unenlightened. In recent years, bandits have risen in swarms, and people's livelihoods are stretched thin. During the Liu-Lu war in June and July of last year, the Lu's troops were all transferred to the front lines for combat, leaving the rear defenses empty, and the bandit forces became even more rampant, making it impossible for the villagers to live in peace. At this time, a northern monk came to Fujian on a pilgrimage, soliciting donations in various villages between Jian'ou and Nanping. He proclaimed to the masses, "I have come to carry out the will of Heaven, eliminate bandits, and save the people. I have incantations that can defeat bandits and talismans that can ward off bullets." The villagers were deeply fearful of the bandits and did not investigate further, believing him to be true. Many flocked to worship him and convert to his teachings. At one time, there were hundreds of followers. The monk then taught them the art of chanting incantations and drawing talismans, as well as knife techniques. When bandits came, they would gather the masses and attack, first tying blue cloths around their heads, wearing red vests covered with talismans as armor, chanting incantations, and charging forward with knives. The bandits, seeing that they disregarded death and charged desperately, often retreated in defeat. The monk became very proud and proclaimed that his gods were spiritual, and added more embellishments. More and more villagers joined, and they established the Great Dao Society (commonly known as the Great Society), dispatching party members to various villages to set up halls, preach the doctrine, and teach disciples. They also created six precepts: in peacetime, abstain from lust, greed, and doubting the gods; in wartime, abstain from looking sideways, retreating, and letting the enemy escape. Violations would render the spells ineffective and the bullets would penetrate the body. The government, seeing that their actions were superstitious but could assist in resisting bandits, did not stop them. As a result, the society spread extremely rapidly, and within a year, it had spread from Jian'ou and Nanping to Shaxian, Jiangle, Shunchang, Jianyang, Songxi, and Zhenghe, with almost every village having a Great Dao Society hall. They were in constant contact with each other, and their influence became very strong. They also used the slogans of refusing to pay exorbitant taxes and resisting harassment by the army. At that time, the troops stationed in the upper reaches were focusing all their efforts on dealing with the Zhu-Peng communist bandits and had no time to pay attention to them. The party members of the society became even more tyrannical, establishing divine donations, forcing ships and rafts along the river to pay establishment fees, and forcing farmers in the countryside to pay rice by household. Merchants and farmers felt great pain and presented petitions to the provincial and county governments, requesting suppression. The troops stationed in northern Fujian also believed that they were intercepting military weapons and refusing to allow passage, which was a serious disruption to the local area, and were planning to jointly suppress them. They also believed that the monk was the real instigator and issued orders to various battalions and teams, ordering them to find ways to capture him and eradicate the roots. However, the society has considerable power and has spread widely, so it will not be easy to eliminate it. (July 23rd)</p>
<h3>Flooding in the Taihu Lake Basin</h3>
<p>▲ Rainfall and Water Levels Increase, Nearly Matching 1921 Levels</p>
<p>This year's plum rain season in the Taihu Lake basin has been heavy, and river levels have risen sharply, exceeding the records of the past decade in many places. Since the beginning of the fu period (mid-July to mid-August), there has been continuous rain, and there is a tendency for further increases. A disaster has already formed. According to the latest statistics from the rain and water level measurement reports of the Taihu Lake Basin Water Conservancy Commission of the Ministry of the Interior, since the beginning of [the rainy season], up to the 20th of this month, the rainfall has been the highest in the Yixing, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, and Qingpu areas, reaching 530 to 470 millimeters. The rainfall in Hangzhou, Haiyan, and Jinshan is relatively low. In general, the rainfall in various places has increased by more than double the average of previous flood seasons, nearly matching the total rainfall of August and September of the great flood of 1921. As a result, river levels have risen sharply in recent days. Although they have not reached the levels of the great flood of 1921, the difference is significant. For example, water levels in the Wujin to Yixing area have risen by more than three feet compared to previous years, and the rest have also risen by about one to two feet. Low-lying areas have been widely submerged, resulting in considerable losses. Many villagers have gone to the county government to report crop failures. Stories of dike breaches, collapsed houses, and collapsed city walls are also frequently heard. After the 20th, there have been thunderstorms every day. The heavy rain has continued day and night for the past two days, and the river levels have risen further. The water outside the Xumen gate in Suzhou has reached the shore. Small boats in various places have mostly stopped operating, and navigation is unfavorable. The water in the rivers inside the city has reached the foundations of houses, and low-lying streets have become ditches. Water has entered people's homes, which has not been seen in the past ten years. If the rain continues to fall, the tides will soon arrive, mountain floods will continue, and clear and turbid waters will collide. Inland lakes and marshes will overflow as a result, and the outlets along the river will inevitably be unable to discharge the water, leading to rampant flooding. The great flood disaster of 1921 will reappear today, and the consequences are unimaginable. It is said that the committee is now sending letters to recorders in various places, investigating the flood situation of this year, and ordering them to fill out detailed reports for unified planning.</p>
<h3>Expanded Organization of the Guangdong Provincial Flood Relief Office</h3>
<p>▲ Due to the Wide Area Affected by Floods and the Severity of the Disaster</p>
<p>▲ Merchants and Charities Continue Efforts</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The flood in Guangdong Province this time is as severe as the great flood of the year 1915. The flood relief situation has been reported in previous issues. However, a drop in the bucket is difficult to use everywhere. In the future, it still depends on the charity circles across the country to quickly raise funds for relief, which is what the people of Guangdong are praying for. At the beginning of the sudden flood, the first organizations in Guangdong Province to advocate for charitable donations were the Convenience Hospital and the City Chamber of Commerce, each initially donating 5,000 yuan as an initiative. Subsequently, various charity halls also made donations of varying amounts. Therefore, the Commercial and Charity Flood Relief Office was established in the Aiyu Charity Hall. The Relief Office organized relief teams, carrying rice and medicines donated by various pharmacies, and departed for the disaster areas in batches to distribute relief. First to the Yuan Tan Pa River in North River, followed by Sanshui Qingyuan Si Hui, the number of relief teams dispatched before and after, a total of eight teams, after the disaster area Liao Guang, Universal Save Wei Yi, by the Flood Relief Office Resolution Expansion Organization, on the fourteenth of the month, convened a meeting in the Aiyu Charity Hall from all walks of life, to the representatives of all walks of life more than a hundred people, when that is presumed the City Chamber of Commerce·Provincial Party Headquarters·Guangji Hospital·Convenience Hospital·Aiyu Charity Hall·General Political Training Office·Social Affairs Bureau·Chongzheng Charity Hall·Silver Industry Association·Public Security Bureau·Huixing Charity Hospital·Zhide Infant Hospital·Overseas Comrades Association·Four Temple Charity Hall·Hu Chun Society·Shipping Association·Rice Bran Industry Association·Bahe Association·Women's Federation·Zun Sheng Charity Hall·Civil Affairs Department·Guangzhou Reporters Association·Machine Industry Association·and other more than twenty organizations as directors, publicly elected the Provincial Party Headquarters Civil Affairs Department Social Affairs Conference General Political Training Office Convenience Hospital as standing directors, divided into the procurement and transportation shares·Disaster relief shares·Finance Shares·Fundraising Shares·Audit Shares·General Affairs Shares·by the directors of the separate positions, and the original relief office name cancelled, Yi Xin name as the business good people from all walks of life co-sponsored Guangdong Flood Relief Association, The association was established, the industry in the sixteenth day of the opening of the first board meeting, to discuss the relief work, as for the official side, in addition to the Provincial Government Civil Affairs Department in the former Zhenwu Association allocated the remaining money, sent investigators to the North River scattered relief, by the authorities to issue a clear decree to allocate 50,000 yuan, handed over to the Civil Affairs Department discretion to allocate relief, the Civil Affairs Department奉令后,当卽斟酌灾情轻重各县,拟定分配数目如下,淸远县九千元,英德县九千元,三水县九千元,花县八千元,四会八千元,高明七千元,尅日分电各该县长,派员来省具领散赈,此外私人团体捐欵散赈者,计有香港东华医院及华商总会,迭派办赈员,购备米石乾粮来省,自本月九日起,分批用船发往灾区,至十三日赈毕返港,十八日香港东华医院,又派来办赈员十一人,押同大批赈品抵省,再赴北江,为第二次之散放,此次携来白米十万斤,赈欵一宗,前往琶江口一带,按照难民人口,分派米粮,并酌给赈欵,俾维持生活,同时香港巨商,如陈某胡某,亦各斥私财,个人捐欵一千或一万,诚属难能可贵,最近广州市社会局,亦发起演剧筹欵办赈,由电影戏院及各游艺场,于本月二十八日起至八月二日,开游艺大会五天,入场券价目,计名誉位收五元,特别位收二元,头等位收入毫,将收入所得,尽拨赈灾之用,至于赈济会成立后,第一次会议议决,函请市府饬令本市各戏院,公司天台游乐场及娱乐捐花票等,由七月份起,一律附抽二成赈欵,以一个月为限,凡流落本市之水灾难民,每名给发五元,遣送回籍,并组织赈灾队,购办白米二万斤,于二十日出发琶江四会等处散放,(七月二十日)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Express</h3>
<p>▲ Wuhu, since a decade ago, due to incessant rain, the low-lying areas have been flooded. Unexpectedly, in the past two days, the heavy rain has not stopped, and the river tide has reversed, causing the water level to rise sharply by more than two feet. The entire city has become a waterlogged area. Main streets and Second Street and other places, the deepest has exceeded two feet, vehicle driving is inconvenient, basins full of streets are all, all industries are greatly affected, the market is even more depressed, rice firewood prices have soared, the poor people's livelihood is difficult, Xiangbaoli area, the houses are only one roof, the water depth is no less than four or five feet, the people are all evacuated to the mountains, Red Swastika Society raised 2,000 diao, sent members to distribute relief, each household five thousand three thousand and so on.</p>

<p>▲ Chen Tiaoyuan went to Lu'an to supervise the suppression of bandit gangs. It was originally scheduled to return to Wuhu on the 23rd, transfer to a steamboat to Anqing, but because of heavy rain, the cars from Lu'an to Hefei could not pass, so they are still staying in Lu. The Deputy Commander of the 46th Division, Li Mei, has already telegraphed the military and police agencies here today.</p>
<p>▲ The Anhui Provincial Government, considering Wuhu as a commercial port and the municipal engineering and construction are very important, passed a resolution to expand and reorganize the Wuhu Engineering Office into the Bureau of Public Works, appointed Public Security Bureau Chief Zhao Jingshi concurrently as the Director of the Bureau, and appointed Yang Shisheng and Sun Ying as the heads of the General Affairs and Engineering Sections, with an annual budget of 8,000 yuan. The bureau has already announced its establishment and started work today at the former Municipal Engineering Office, intending to raise 5,000 yuan first to renovate the roads.</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>A Flood Unseen in Ten Years Suzhou has been experiencing continuous heavy rain, and the river water has been rising steadily. The low-lying streets and alleys in the city are ankle-deep in water. The fields and crops in various villages have been submerged, and the price of rice has been rising steadily, jumping by one yuan per stone in two days. At the same time, the river water outside Qimen and Xumen and other places has risen to the shore. There have been dozens of cases of house collapses and injuries inside and outside the city. According to a survey report by the Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Commission, this flood is the worst in ten years, comparable to the great flood of 1911.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Zhang Renji's Strange Fire Burned Four More Times Yesterday Zhang Renji's candy store in the north of the city, Zhang Renji, suddenly suffered a fire on the 21st. In half a day, it burned as many as eleven times. Everyone said that it was a fox spirit causing trouble. Now I learned that the store owner, Zhang Jinchang, invited more than a dozen relatives and friends to defend it all night to prevent accidents, and the neighbors also warned each other not to sleep peacefully. There was no movement during the night. It was not until the next morning (23rd) at about 8:00 am that the watchers were very tired and were just drowsily falling asleep. The east corner of the building suddenly became hazy with smoke and fire broke out under the bed. Fortunately, it was spotted immediately and extinguished with water. Afterwards, the fire broke out three more times in two hours. Fortunately, there was someone guarding it, so no major disaster occurred. Later, Zhang Jinchang realized that every time the fire broke out, it was always next to his granddaughter, whether in front or behind her. He had repeatedly seen this without fail. The granddaughter is now thirteen years old, studying at a primary school, and is quite intelligent. The grandfather secretly inquired about the cause of the strange fire. According to the sister, there was nothing different. She had only gone to the Xijin Public Institute in Xilong to play the day before, and a fire broke out when she returned. It is said that the Xijin Public Institute enshrines a fox god, so it may have been brought back, and so on. The shopkeeper was superstitious, in addition to offering a fox seat upstairs, he also sent his granddaughter to live in Shanghai's Qi family temporarily on the 24th.</p>
<p>Continuous Rain and Disaster This place has been experiencing heavy rain since the 5th of this month. The river water has risen sharply, and the fields have been submerged, almost becoming a disaster. Boats to various ports have not yet resumed, and transportation is quite inconvenient. Although there were many sunny days in the middle ten days, the water volume has not receded. On the afternoon of the 22nd, heavy rain suddenly fell again, and by the afternoon of the next day, it was still continuous. The water volume rose more than a foot again. The embankments built by farmers and workers were almost completely washed away by the heavy rain. The fields are still flooded as usual. The rice seedlings have been immersed in water for a long time, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. Now, the district offices have reported the disaster situation to the county government. As for the inland boats to various ports, it was originally planned to resume soon, but after this rainstorm, I am afraid that it will be difficult to recover within ten days.</p>
<p>Business Tax Bureau Will Soon Close This county's business tax, originally set up a special bureau to collect taxes, was later convened by the County Chamber of Commerce to call a meeting of the various industry associations, decided to recognize the package to the Department of Finance by the Chamber of Commerce to set up another committee, has been settled properly, estimated annual recognition of 50,000 yuan, is now beginning to collect taxes, a side has sent members to the four townships to investigate the business situation, soon can be completed, but in the collection of taxes, all certificates, are still in the Business Tax Bureau, have not been handed over by Director Hong, now the Chamber of Commerce is anxious to collect taxes, so yesterday (24) specially sent staff Gu Xikui Zou Jinsheng, to the Business Tax Bureau to receive the various certificates, often by Director Hong points out the number of transactions, but the previous levy of taxes, has not been handed over, now the bureau is rushing to handle the handover, will soon be closed,</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Continuation of Records on the Wuxi Flood Disaster: The situation of the flood in the county has been detailed in yesterday's report. It is now learned that among the largest embankments in the fifteenth district, only Yangjia Embankment and Laoya'an Embankment can still be salvaged by bailing. Many others cannot be bailed out due to lack of power. Moreover, Yang Qi'an, Shangxia Yang'an, and San Embankments all burst successively the night before, resulting in extremely heavy losses. Fortunately, there are no residents in the embankments, so there have been no losses of people or livestock. In the Beitang area, grain warehouses are all submerged in water and could not be salvaged in time. The wheat in the granaries has gradually sprouted, and there is no way to stack rice. In addition to using pine boards to build high piles, large boats have been rented to temporarily move the grain into the boats. A decision will be made after the water recedes after a long period of sunny weather. However, the losses to both the warehouse and customer sides are extremely large. Yesterday morning, there was a little sunshine, but the sky turned dark in the afternoon, and heavy rain fell again. Traffic between urban and rural areas has slightly recovered. Small boats from Zhangcun, Banqiao, Gushan, Chenshu, Huangtutang, Fangqian, Meicun, Youjiadan, Xueyanqiao, Qianzhou, Laoyaqiao, Hua Dafangzhuang, and other places have all started to sail into the city to facilitate traffic.</p>
<p>Smoke Prohibition After the Abolition of the Investigation Office: Everyone knows the harm of opium. Fortunately, the establishment of the Opium Prohibition Investigation Office was opposed and has been ordered to be abolished. Before the abolition, judicial and administrative organs received clear orders from their superiors that they should not accept cases related to opium administration. Therefore, during this time of transition, it was convenient for opium offenders. Unexpectedly, the Investigation Office, like a flash in the pan, still wants to strictly prohibit opium. However, the judicial organs have not yet received a clear order to accept cases as usual, so there have been instances of refusal to accept cases. A few days ago, the Ninth Branch of the County Public Security Bureau arrested several red pill offenders in the countryside and submitted them to the County Public Security Bureau, which transferred them to the County Court for interrogation. At that time, the court had not yet received a clear order to accept cases, so there was once a refusal. After receiving the clear order, they accepted cases as usual. However, the public security branches have stopped carrying out arrests for several days.</p>
<p>Robbers Repeatedly Robbed and Injured People in Kaihua Township: Since Chen Chuande took office as the county magistrate of this county, there has been no day without robbery cases in the four townships. The prospect of public security is precarious. In Nian Qi-San Tu (273 Tu), Jinxi Bridge area of the fourteenth district (Kaihua Township), resident Zhu Yude, who runs an iron shop on Baixianqiao in Shanghai, is considered well-off. At 12 o'clock in the evening the other day, amid heavy rain, the village dogs barked wildly. Zhu's wife, Song, and his son, Agou, heard the sound and suspected that thieves had come. They immediately put on their clothes and got out of bed to open the door and look out. Suddenly, seven or eight robbers wearing black short jackets, speaking a mixture of local and Hakka dialects, appeared. Several of the robbers were only in their twenties, each holding a handgun and candles. Three robbers stood guard outside the door, while the remaining robbers entered the house to search and rob, and tied up Song and her son, as well as their adopted daughter-in-law, demanding to know where the money was hidden. As a result, more than one hundred yuan in cash was robbed. After the robbers obtained the loot, they were not satisfied and broke the walls in Zhu's house. They also forced their way into the home of the widow Lu Dong, tied her hands behind her back, and burned her left breast and left wrist with candles. Lu Dong had no choice but to offer five yuan in banknotes to the robbers. Seeing this, the robbers thought that Lu Dong was cunning and took out a handgun and shot at the ground to intimidate her. Unexpectedly, the bullet hit her right instep, and blood flowed like a river. She fell to the ground in extreme pain. Seeing that they had injured someone, the robbers shouted and fled. After checking, the loss was several dozen yuan. Yesterday, her sister-in-law, Xu, sent the injured person to the city by boat and admitted her to the Brothers Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Wujiang</h3>
<p>A Large Batch of Opium Seized in Tongli: Xia Xin, the chief of the Second Public Security Branch of Tongli Town in the county, seized a ship transporting opium in the Jiangjiaqiao River in the town the other day, and confiscated two bundles of opium. Yesterday, he sent it to the county government for investigation.</p>
<p>Heng 快 Rapid Boat Overturned in Thunderstorm: The rapid boat traveling between Heng 蕩 and Suzhou in this county overturned on the morning of the 24th at 8 o'clock while returning to Heng 蕩 from Suzhou, passing the Wulong Bridge outside Panmen. Suddenly, there was a clap of thunder, and the boat overturned immediately. All the passengers, boatmen, and goods in the boat fell into the river. Fortunately, the rescue was effective, but two female passengers drowned, which was also tragic.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Petition from the Inn Industry: The inn industry in Wujin County petitioned because the Public Security Bureau decided to have the police from the branch offices and outposts conduct overnight inspections of inns to eliminate opium, gambling, and prostitution, which has a great impact on the business of inns. Therefore, at 10 a.m. on the 25th, they sent representatives Pang Baosheng and five others to the County Chamber of Commerce to petition. Lin Junbao received them and, after discussing the results, Mr. Lin agreed to contact the Public Security Bureau and then determine a solution. The six representatives then went to the Public Security Bureau to petition. The chief of the First Section, Wang Xiaowu, received them. After a long discussion, Chief Wang consulted with Mr. Lin of the Chamber of Commerce by telephone. As a result, it was temporarily decided that each inn would be routinely inspected from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. by the responsible branch office and outpost. Special inspections would be conducted by the Public Security Bureau from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. The representatives then took their leave.</p>
<p>Traffic Restored at the North Gate: The city gate tower at the North Gate of Wujin County had been in disrepair for many years. Recently, it collapsed suddenly due to continuous heavy rain, causing traffic congestion. The Construction Bureau sent a large number of workers to clean up and remove the mud and bricks, and traffic was finally restored.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The Flood Situation in Tong County is Getting Worse: Nantong city and rural areas have been hit by severe flooding. At about 8 p.m. on the 24th, there was another heavy thunderstorm, causing the streets in the city to become rivers in an instant. The water in the shops was several feet deep, and the city river overflowed. The rural areas were even more of a vast expanse of water. Farmers fled to the rooftops. The disaster situation is getting worse. The water depth in the Zao Di area of the northeast township reached several feet, which is a rare disaster that has not occurred in more than twenty years.</p>
<p>Resolution of Automobile Donation in Various Counties North of the Yangtze River: The Construction Department previously convened the heads of the Construction Bureaus of various counties north of the Yangtze River to discuss the implementation of collecting automobile donations according to the new regulations. All car owners unanimously went on strike against the donation. The heads of the Construction Bureaus of various counties telegraphed the department, stating that the automobile industry was facing high costs due to the rising price of gold, and requested permission to temporarily postpone the new regulations. On the 25th, a telegram replied that automobile donations would be collected according to the old regulations at seven yuan per month. The dispute was thus resolved.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Literature Committee: The county government, upon the order of the provincial government, gathered Education Bureau Chief Guan Jincheng, District Chief Xu, and the principals of major secondary and primary schools to establish a literature committee to compile the county gazetteer.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Joint Meeting of Principals Opposing the New Budget: The principals of various primary schools in Jiangdu County believe that there are many inappropriate aspects of the new education budget compiled by the administrative side. Therefore, they held a meeting yesterday to discuss the reasons, which are as follows: (1) The budget for the 20th year was not approved by the Education Administration Conference, but was compiled solely by the bureau chief, which is considered inappropriate. (2) The teaching time per grade in primary school is approximately 1,200 minutes or more. The new standard requires one person, which is impossible for one person to handle and complete since people are not omnipotent; those who can teach Chinese and arithmetic may not be able to teach music, physical education, art, and crafts; those who can teach music, physical education, art, and crafts may not be able to teach Chinese and arithmetic. (3) The education administration and social education agencies have not been reduced, but primary school education alone has been reduced again and again, which is considered unfair. (4) The previous National Assembly had a resolution to improve the treatment of primary school education, and the Ministry of Education also had a clear order to improve the treatment of primary school teachers. Now, Director Chen is compiling the budget for the 20th year, reducing primary school funding, which is a violation of orders. (5) The Jiangdu education financial situation is difficult, not because of the large expenditure, but because the income cannot be organized. The collectors of the right book and school land miscellaneous donations are heavily in arrears. The bureau chief is not good at urging and organizing collections, but only reduces expenses, which is unreasonable. Based on the above five points, the following two resolutions were made: (1) Request the Education Association to actively appeal to the provincial, county, and bureau authorities. (2) Send representatives to Zhenjiang with the standing committee members of the Education Association to petition. Yang Chuqing and Jin Shengfu were immediately decided as the representatives.</p>
<p>Heavy Rain Again Yesterday for a Day and Night: In the area north of the Yangtze River, there has been the most rain in the past half month. The Yangtze River tide and lake water are already showing signs of an unmanageable disaster. Unexpectedly, heavy rain poured down again in Yangzhou City from the evening of the 23rd until 9 p.m. on the 24th, causing the ground water to rise by more than a foot. On that day, not only were ships and automobiles not operating, but long-distance telephone lines were also unable to connect due to the rain. The Shanghai newspapers have not arrived for three days. Eight or nine out of ten poor people are running out of food. The phenomenon of widespread suffering is being realized in the city. The severity of the disaster can be seen from this. Zhang Zhijiang, the Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner, convened a meeting of the main personnel of various agencies due to the continuous heavy rain and frequent reports of disasters in various places. Taking Yangzhou City as an example, most of the streets and alleys have become swamps. He convened an emergency meeting last night (the 24th) to discuss prevention and emergency relief methods. The attendees included Chen Changwei, a member of the County Party Department, the brigade commander of the 94th Brigade, Chen, the county magistrate of the County Government, Wang, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, An, the director of the Public Security Bureau, Feng, the director of the Construction Bureau, and Shao, the director of the Jiangdu Section of the Engineering Office. Yu Dianshu, the chief of staff of the Commissioner's Office, presided over the meeting and discussed prevention measures: (1) When the water in the Grand Canal along the border of Jiangdu rises to the shore, sandbags can be used for prevention. (2) Pay attention to preventing the westward water from flowing eastward. (3) The municipal and county governments and the Construction Bureau will jointly provide relief to the residents in the city who have been flooded. (4) Quickly seek emergency relief methods for the disaster areas in the four townships.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Robbery and Injury in Yuanjia Village: Farmers Tao Tianjue's house in Yuanjia Village, East Township, was suddenly attacked by many bandits the other night, each armed with guns and weapons. They broke into the house and shouted to silence the residents. They looted and searched violently. The Tao family members did not have time to escape and were imprisoned in one room. The bandits demanded the surrender of silver dollars, but their demands were not met. They tied up the housewife, stabbed her right arm with a knife, and shot through the owner's right leg. After about an hour, they escaped with their loot.</p>
<p>Change of Prison Officer: Li Yurui, the prison officer of this county, has now been transferred to Songjiang by order of the High Court. His vacancy will be filled by Zheng Ligeng.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Opening of the Vagrant Vocational Training Center: The Jiaxing County Qingxiang Bureau, during this period of handling Qingxiang matters, sent a letter to the county government to plan the establishment of a vagrant vocational training center. The county government has planned funds and organized its establishment. On one hand, the vagrants detained by the Qingxiang Bureau have been sent to the vocational training center for custody. It is now known that a continuous stream of vagrants, already numbering thirty-seven, has been sent. The internal workshops have also been prepared and will officially start work on the 26th. They are divided into four departments: cotton weaving, sewing, printing, and sock weaving.</p>
<p>Continuous Rain Brings Disaster, Fields and Crops Submerged: Jiaxing has been experiencing continuous rain, and the river water has risen sharply. The northern countryside has become a swamp. The fields are indistinguishable, and the rice crops are completely submerged. Although the farmers have tried to protect them, the rain has not stopped, so there is no effect. They have reported the disaster to the county government. The County Agricultural Association has convened an emergency meeting to request funds for water conservancy in western Zhejiang to urgently repair the dikes. At the same time, it has sent letters to the village councils in various rural areas to urge farmers to repair the embankment dikes, and has submitted a request to the county government to strictly prohibit the passage of steamships. The small steamships operating to various ports have all suspended operations for many days due to the rising water.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Impact of Heavy Rain on Hangzhou-Changxing and Hangzhou-Pingyao Roads: Due to the continuous heavy rain and mountain floods, the road surface of the Hangzhou-Changxing Highway from Jingshan to Shijiaqiao has been washed away for three or four zhang. Therefore, the route was temporarily suspended from the 23rd. The Provincial Highway Bureau sent personnel to repair it, and it resumed operation on the afternoon of the 24th. Unexpectedly, there was heavy rain all night on the 25th, which did not stop until noon yesterday (the 26th). The water level in the Pingyao to Penggongling area of the road rose by two or three feet, and the route was suspended again in the afternoon. At 3 p.m., the water receded gradually, and tickets were sold as usual. After the heavy rain on the Hangzhou-Pingyao Road, the mud and rocks on the road surface from Qibao to Qiaosi were loose and cracked, and vehicles could not travel. The director of the Highway Administration Bureau, Huang, immediately ordered the chief of the engineering section, Sun Faduan, to supervise the workers to rush to repair the road overnight. Due to the importance of traffic, the route is scheduled to operate as usual today (the 27th) to facilitate travel. It is also heard that a small chartered car from Moganshan to Hangzhou was driven to Penggongling during the flood. Because the water was quite high, the interior was also wet. After stopping to repair the engine, a large fish about a foot long jumped into the car and was carried to Hangzhou, which is also an interesting story.</p>
<p>Tragedy of a Child Falling into a Pot and Being Boiled to Death: A Jiangbei barge named Cao, in Gongbu Dakou, was boiling water in the cabin after unloading goods yesterday morning. His wife and child were lying on the cabin floor. The child was three years old and had not yet been weaned. Unexpectedly, Cao's wife fell asleep due to fatigue. Cao was also talking with friends on the shore. The child accidentally turned over and fell into the pot. The water was boiling, and the child was boiled to death. Cao's wife woke up in surprise, but it was too late to save him.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Homeowners Strongly Oppose the Construction of an Airport: The site of the Wangjiawan Airport outside the West Gate of this port has been completely surveyed yesterday, totaling about 500 mu, with about 300 graves. The farmers and villagers in the bay believe that after the airport is built, the fields will be requisitioned and the houses will have to be demolished. Therefore, at noon yesterday, more than 200 men, women, old and young people gathered at the office of the neighborhood committee to make noise, demanding that the county government strive to prevent the construction of the airport. The neighborhood chief had no idea what to do, so he telephoned the Yin County government. After receiving the call, County Magistrate Chen sent two section members, Zhang Leyao and Chen Bangji, to explain, saying that the construction of the airport was ordered by the General Headquarters and had to be completed within a month. Although the county government knew the various losses of the residents, it was limited by official regulations and was truly in a difficult situation. Since the facts are as they are, it is best to elect a few representatives to express their opinions so that they can be conveyed and adopted. Later, the farmers elected Wang Xiazi and three others to express three opinions: (1) The early rice must be harvested before construction can begin. (2) The county government must assess and compensate for the losses of the farmers. (3) The county government must find a way to take care of the families who make a living by renting fields. Zhang and Chen promised to convey these opinions, and the villagers dispersed.</p>
<p>Tian Shulan, Who is Traveling Around the Country, Arrives in Ningbo: Tian Shulan from Hunan, who is determined to travel around the country, set off from Hangzhou on the 23rd and arrived in Ningbo. The planned travel period is six years. He will start from Shanghai, return to Shanghai, and then make the great move to travel around the world.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Negotiations Completed for the 200,000 Yuan Provincial Loan: The case of the Zhejiang Finance Department borrowing 200,000 yuan from the silver and money industries in Shaoxing has now been successfully negotiated. It has been designated that the new and old land tax silver and rice taxes in Shaoxing County will be collected and repaid as soon as possible. All previous unpaid unified donation loans of 150,000 yuan will be converted into new and old land tax repayments, with a monthly interest rate of one cent. Taxes will be collected daily, and the bureau will hand them over to the county treasury for special storage. In addition to paying the interest of more than 13,000 yuan under the previous unified donation loan, the funds will be allocated and paid in full from the previous special funds. The county bureau's monthly administrative expenses, as well as the food rations for the inmates in the prison and detention center, will still be allocated from the collected regular tax. When the remaining funds accumulate to 10,000 yuan, the loan will be repaid once, with interest reduced accordingly until it is fully repaid. This method has now been approved by the Finance Department, ordering the county bureau to sign a loan agreement with the representatives of the silver and money industries on a specific date.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation of Tang Renping's Rice Losses: The case of Tang Rixin, the former county magistrate of Shaoxing, failing to handle rice price stabilization and causing huge losses is being thoroughly investigated by Weng Shuiping, who was sent by the Department of Civil Affairs to Shaoxing yesterday. Because this case involves the waste of local public funds, Commissioner Weng convened a meeting of local public organizations unrelated to the Food Maintenance Association at the county government on the morning of the 26th to discuss responsibility and the disposal of stored rice.</p>
<h3>Qu County</h3>
<p>Trial Operation of Traffic on the Quzhou-Changshan Road: The automobile route from Changshan in western Zhejiang to Yushan in eastern Jiangxi has long been opened to traffic. However, the automobile road from Qu County to Changshan, which has been contracted by the Hengchang Long-Distance Automobile Company for a long time, was originally scheduled to open to traffic this year. Due to the importance of suppressing bandits in eastern Jiangxi and the need for military transportation on the road, the company spared no expense to hire thousands of workers to rush to build the road day and night. It has now been completed. At 8 a.m. on the 21st of this month, the company borrowed two automobiles from the Changyu Automobile Company and carried passengers from Changshan to Qu County. The Wanchuan Engineering Office also sent empty cars to Shuanggangkou to welcome Wu Bokang, the county magistrate of Qu County, Lu Zutao, the chief of the Construction Section, and Xiang Hualing and Chen Mu, the company's preparatory committee members, to the Wanchuan Engineering Office for a meal and took a photo before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Anqing</h3>
<p>Change of County Magistrates in Fuyang, Chaoxian, and Hefei: The Provincial Government's Standing Committee approved the change of county magistrates in three counties on the 25th. Wang Yunlong, the county magistrate of Fuyang County, was dismissed from his post and investigated. His vacancy will be filled by Liu Fohang, the county magistrate of Chaoxian County. The vacancy left by him will be filled by Zhang Shusen, the county magistrate of Hefei County. The vacant position of county magistrate of Hefei County will be provisionally filled by Zhou Junnan.</p>
<p>Provincial Government Allocates Funds to Aid Relief in Jiangxi Disaster: The Provincial Government's Standing Committee on the 24th, due to receiving a cold telegram from Xiong Shiyao and others in Nanchang, stated that the Red Disaster in Jiangxi Province was spreading and ravaging more than 50 counties, with more than 4 million people fleeing. An order was issued to establish a relief agency to plan relief matters. It was dared to launch an emergency relief effort, and it was decided to order the Finance Department to allocate 2,000 yuan in relief funds to be remitted immediately.</p>

<p>▲ Confiscations in Zhabei, Pudong, and Nanshi</p>
<p>▲ All Departments to Work as Usual on Sundays</p>
<p>▲ Customs Brokers to Refuse Handling of Japanese Goods Starting Today</p>
<p>After commencing inspection work, the Anti-Japanese and Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Committee has confiscated Japanese goods at its three inspection branches in Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong. The committee held its third executive meeting yesterday to discuss methods for managing confiscated Japanese goods, taking an extremely cautious approach. Details of the reports are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Confiscated Japanese Goods: According to official reports from the committee's inspection department, the quantity of Japanese goods confiscated in recent days is as follows: (1) On the 23rd, the Zhabei inspection station confiscated eleven cases of foreign cloth and flannel of brands such as Shen Tai Transport Company's "Fu Lu Jin Ji" and Gong Yi Company's "Zhi Gong Ni" two cases, also Qing Ji Company six pieces of printed cloth and three bales of foreign cloth at the North Railway Station.

<p>▲ Storage Methods: The methods for storing confiscated Japanese goods were seriously discussed at yesterday's third executive meeting. At the same time, based on the proposal of Chen Songyuan, convener of the Design Committee, it was advocated that several designated public warehouses be used. Whenever goods are confiscated, in addition to counting the number of items on the spot, issuing a receipt, and handing it over to the owner, the goods should be immediately sent to the public warehouse for storage. After detailed research, the following storage methods were decided: (1) Confiscated goods should be sent to the warehouse at any time. (2) Immediately after confiscation, the inspection department should notify the investigation department to investigate whether the goods are indeed Japanese goods. (3) After storage, the warehouse receipt should be sent to the storage department for inspection and safekeeping. (4) When confiscating goods, the quantity of items recorded on the goods should not only be based on the number of items in order to prevent abuses. (5) After confiscation, the inspection department should issue a receipt to the owner of the goods. (6) Confiscated goods should be published daily in the newspaper's news column for easy reference. (7) The release of goods must be decided by the executive committee. (8) Confiscation and release of goods should be reported to the executive committee.</p>
<p>▲ Return of British Goods: On the 24th, the Zhabei inspection station of the inspection department confiscated 30 bales of rayon and three large bales of double thread belonging to the Weida Silk Factory on Baoshan Road. Subsequently, the factory came to the committee and claimed that the goods were British goods and brought the order as proof. The committee's investigation department went to investigate and confirmed that the 30 bales of rayon were indeed British goods, while the three large bales of double thread were determined to be Japanese goods. The report was submitted to the executive committee, and the executive committee decided that the rayon should be returned, and the double thread should be retained and await disposal.</p>

It was decided to form a storage committee and submit it to the executive committee for discussion. The resignation should be rejected with words of comfort. (6) The inspection department's report was discussed regarding how to dispose of old Japanese bottles found at the South Railway Station. It was decided to temporarily detain them.

<p>▲ Joint Association Telegram: The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory United Association sent a telegram stating: To all newspapers, all levels of party headquarters, all institutions, and all organizations nationwide, Recently, Japanese police in Wanbaoshan shot and killed our country's farmers and instigated Korean people to riot and brutally massacre overseas Chinese in Korea. Shocking telegrams have been sent, and we are deeply indignant. Such brutal behavior is intolerable to the world and not permitted by public law. Who has no parents, who has no siblings, who has no spouse, who has no relatives and friends? Reading investigation reports and communications from all parties, the cries of sorrow and pain are inhumane and shocking. Such brutal behavior, if not instigated by someone, would not be so bold and reckless. The members of this association, after painful reflection, emulate the meaning of letting down hair and tying crowns, believing that the Japanese government should be fully responsible for this type of case. In addition to waiting for our national government to deal with the matter seriously, our self-help method is to adopt a self-sufficient policy, strive to produce, and control its source, without overt forms of resistance, to achieve the effect of developing industry. When it comes to saving the country, there is nothing better than this. This association, as a group of national goods factories, has taken promoting the national goods industry as its duty. Outwardly, we fear the neighboring country's atrocities; inwardly, we worry about the decline of popular morale. We dare to make an urgent appeal to make a slight contribution. We deeply hope that those in power in the government will remember the national crisis, support each other, reduce donations and taxes, and eliminate corruption. We also hope that our comrades in the national goods industry at home and abroad will rise up together, complete this ambition, and strive to produce, which is to save ourselves, and also to save the country and save people. We offer these tearful words, hoping for your consideration. Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory United Association.</p>

<h3>The 4th District, 10th Sub-District Cables to Condemn Shi Yousan</h3>
<p>The 4th District, 10th Sub-District of this city sent a telegram stating: (abbreviated title) At this time of national difficulty, it is the day when soldiers should repay the country with loyalty. It is appropriate to unite and first eliminate the red flames, and then jointly resist foreign enemies. Internal and external troubles can be eliminated one after another, and construction can be enumerated, and political training will be completed accordingly. However, Shi Yousan acted perversely and helped the wicked, recognized thieves as fathers, sold the country for glory, and relied on the red to consolidate himself, abandoning himself from China, abandoning himself from the nation, and committing great treason. Everyone will condemn him. We deeply hope that armed comrades will capture Shi Yousan himself in one fell swoop, smash him into pieces, grind his bones and scatter his ashes, so as to clarify the national law and correct the criminal law, kill one to warn a hundred, so as to eliminate future troubles. The nation can hope for survival, and the country can hope for improvement. Eliminating one Qin Hui means that foreign enemies will have one less internal response. Eliminating one Qingfu means that the mainland will have one less calamity star. All sectors of the country should quickly rise up to plan and maintain the situation, so that it does not spread. The country is fortunate, the nation is fortunate. This telegram is hereby sent, hoping that you will be aware of it. Executive Committee of the 4th District, 10th Sub-District of the Kuomintang of China, Shanghai Special Municipality, seal.</p>
<h3>Wu Liande Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

He arrived at the port at about 5 p.m. yesterday. The staff of the Seaport Epidemic Prevention Office of this city and Wu's relatives and friends went to the pier to welcome him. After Wu landed, he took a small ferry across the river to his residence to rest. It is reported that Wu's trip to Beijing has not yet been decided.

<h3>Shanghai-Xiamen Radio is Operating Smoothly as Usual</h3>
<p>The short-wave radio station from the Ministry of Communications in Shanghai to Xiamen has been operating exceptionally well in recent days, resulting in the original generator being insufficient. It was ordered by the Ministry of Communications the month before last to add new equipment on both sides, which has already been established. Currently, Shanghai and Xiamen each have three generators for communication. If one generator is damaged, another can be used, so there is no concern that communication between the two places will be interrupted, and it is extremely fast and reliable.</p>
<h3>Chinese Eggs Will Be Severely Hit After the Success of the Soviet Russian Plan</h3>
<p>▲ Hope the Government Has a Way to Take Care of the Aftermath</p>
<p>Our country's egg exports have gradually become one of the main exports since the European War. Recently, due to the high price of gold and the low price of silver, there should be good results, but the result is the opposite. Because the world's production is excessive, prices are low, and egg prices have fallen sharply. Our country's egg merchants have suffered losses and are all disappointed. Moreover, the United States has repeatedly increased import egg taxes, and Japan is striving to supply itself. The Pacific route is gradually becoming extinct. The only thing that can decorate the foreign market is Europe. In the Soviet Russian government's five-year plan, the egg production industry is also striving for rapid progress, trying to regain the position of leader in the world's egg industry before the European War. 64 million gold was allocated specifically for expanding the egg industry. In addition to cultivating egg chickens to increase production, the plan also includes building five large-scale egg factories, and increasing the number of new-style egg warehouses to 567, new-style chicken coops to 377, and building 79 new cold storage warehouses. It is estimated that after the completion of the above plan, 1.36 trillion eggs can be produced annually. In addition to supplying domestic consumption of about 1 trillion, there will be a surplus of 360 billion eggs that can be sold abroad (approximately 2.2 million long boxes). It is estimated that this year's egg exports from our country will be about 90,000 to 100,000 long boxes, only slightly less than one-twenty-second of the surplus from the Soviet Union. In the future, Russian eggs will be devalued and dumped, which will severely hit Chinese eggs. In addition, after our country increased the huge export egg tax, egg merchants have been affected. Recently, Anhui Province has also had an egg industry business tax incident, which was contracted by a few people, and business tax was levied on egg farms, ignoring the instructions of the Ministry of Finance (the Ministry of Finance approved and ordered the Anhui Finance Department to exempt business tax for those who only buy and do not sell to the customers). This is truly the misfortune of the egg industry. We hope that those in power will take care of the aftermath.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks for Relief for the Flour Industry</h3>
<p>▲ Levy Import Tax on Foreign Flour</p>
<p>▲ And Reduce the Uniform Tax on Chinese Flour</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to provide relief to my country's flour industry. The original text said: The request was submitted, and on the 23rd of this month, the flour factory industry association of this city and the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui inland machine-made flour factory association jointly stated in a letter that since the Qing Jiawu period, wheat began to be subject to a production and sales tax of four cents of silver per stone, while flour was generally exempted from tax throughout the country. Until July 17 of the Republic of China, an order from the Ministry of Finance was issued, exempting wheat from tax and instead levying a special tax on wheat flour of one jiao per bag of foreign currency. Examining the practices of various countries in the world, wheat flour is generally not taxed, but the import tax on foreign flour is very heavy. When the regulations on the special tax on wheat flour were promulgated, it was the beginning of construction after the success of the Northern Expedition. The merchants and people expressed their obedience, originally hoping that after unification, the government would automatically abolish it to meet the world's trend and comfort the merchants and people's expectations. However, since the tax was levied, it has been three years. The flour merchants have fulfilled their obligations, which cannot be said to be not many, but there is still no import tax on foreign flour, allowing it to be imported as much as possible and dumping it. China's flour industry is still in its infancy, and how can it resist? Moreover, the special tax on wheat flour was originally to offset the wheat tax. Now, under the business tax food item, wheat has not been excluded. Although the nature and name of the tax are different, in reality, it has restored the previous wheat tax situation. Examining the business tax on food, only 2 or 3 per mille is levied. For example, wheat flour is subject to a uniform tax of one jiao per bag, which is 3%. How far apart is it? Moreover, flour shops must pay business tax before they are allowed to sell flour. Wheat is taxed, wheat flour is taxed when it leaves the factory, and it is taxed again when it is sold. Three taxes on one item, how can merchants and people bear it? The current value of gold is soaring, and the prices of all metals and materials are rising. The cost of flour factories has increased, and the selling price cannot be resisted due to the dumping of foreign flour. In addition, with the 3% uniform tax, manufacturers are struggling to make ends meet. The country had no choice but to levy taxes on the people's food. We should ask your association to submit to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry for review and approval to reduce the uniform tax rate on wheat flour to show generosity, which will benefit both commerce and people's livelihood. On the one hand, for the import of foreign flour, we should follow the precedents of various countries and heavily levy import taxes to stop loopholes. This matter is related to the vital interests of the flour industry, and we sincerely appeal and are extremely eager to wait for orders, etc., to be sent to the meeting. Upon inquiry, this matter was first received by the Tianjin General Chamber of Commerce in January of this year, stating that Tianjin flour factories were affected by the dumping of foreign flour. Of the original eight factories, only one remains, and it is necessary to provide assistance. We should submit to the Department for a reward fund method, for the Chinese factory's uniform tax, a certain percentage should be refunded, or for the low-priced dumping of foreign flour, the current anti-dumping tax law should be applied, and an anti-dumping tax should be levied. Afterwards, the Department issued Order No. 5214, stating that according to the association's previous transfer of the decline of Tianjin flour industry, please prepare a foreign flour consumption tax to maintain domestic goods, etc., the situation was reported to the Ministry of Finance for review and handling, and a telegram was sent on its behalf. This has been approved. The case was previously transferred by the Hebei Finance Commissioner. At that time, the situation was instructed to be observed, and a plan was prepared and reported. It is known that the previous reasons should be checked and notified, etc. This was approved. A notice was issued to the association, etc. It has been a long time since then. How exactly the plan was prepared and reported has not been informed. The Tianjin Chamber of Commerce claimed that foreign flour used to be sold to our country's interior, and taxes had to be paid everywhere, approximately one jiao and six or seven fen per bag. In addition, the two flour factory associations stated that wheat used to be subject to a production and sales tax of only four cents of silver per stone, while flour was generally exempted from tax throughout the country. Afterwards, special taxes and uniform taxes were implemented in turn, with Chinese and foreign flour being subject to the same tax rate. According to the above situation, although Chinese flour raw materials have been granted the grace of tax exemption, in practice, it is just changing the tax to a tax, which is equal to nothing. However, foreign flour, due to the uniform tax, has been reduced and is more popular. All of this refers to the time before the business tax was handled. Since the business tax was levied on wheat, considering the situation, although it is not a tax on objects, it is the common practice of businessmen to seek profit. The amount of tax they bear will inevitably be added to the price of wheat. Chinese factories have the concern that the price of raw materials will increase, while foreign flour is imported from foreign countries, and the raw materials are not affected by the price increase, so it can be sold cheaply. The difficulties listed by the two associations can supplement the previous letter from the Tianjin General Chamber of Commerce. According to the letter's content, we should prepare a document to submit to the Ministry for review and approval, and handle it separately as requested by the association to maintain industry, which is in the public interest.</p>

<h3>Seaport Quarantine Office Temporarily Suspends Disinfection of Sailing Ships</h3>
<p>▲ Boat Gangs' Opposing Attitude is Firm</p>
<p>▲ Quarantine Office Reports to the General Office for Handling</p>
<p>The Wusong Seaport Quarantine Office, following the order of Wu Liande, Director of the National Seaport Quarantine Office, strictly prevents plague and has formulated five disinfection rules for ships. Starting this month, imported large and small sand fishing boats from the north and south gangs will also be disinfected with medicinal water. Unexpectedly, the merchant boat gangs at Songkou believe that the disinfection procedures are complicated and time-consuming, and they feel that the disinfection fee charged by the office is too high and cannot be borne, so they have united and firmly opposed it. In recent days, all imported large and small ships have refused to allow medical officers to board the ship to carry out disinfection procedures. The Chinese and Western medical officers of the office, seeing this situation, were deeply afraid of accidents, so they temporarily suspended the disinfection of sailing ships from the day before yesterday. According to Chinese officials of the office yesterday, epidemic prevention work is important, and sailing ship disinfection is necessary and will not be terminated due to the opposition of the boat merchants. Moreover, foreign small barges have all been disinfected in accordance with the regulations, which is an international practice, so there is no objection. If domestic sailing ships are not disinfected, foreigners will criticize it. The office has reported to Director Wu of the National Seaport Quarantine Office for instructions. The sailing ship disinfection fee was originally set at ten taels and five taels. It is true that the poor boat households of the second-class sailing ships cannot afford it. Perhaps it will be reduced to five taels and two and a half taels to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants. This issue must also be resolved after Director Wu arrives in Shanghai today (yesterday).</p>

<h3>Jisheng Society Receives Disaster Reports from Various Provinces</h3>

Rice and autumn grain have been completely submerged, and livestock, people, houses, utensils, food, clothing, and property have been lost by tens or hundreds of millions. The number of deaths is countless. The affected areas inside and outside the city and villages are specifically reported and are too numerous to list. In Henan Province, Guangshan, Luoshan, Gushi, Shangcheng, Dengxian, Nanzhao, Tongbai, Nanyang, Songxian, Tanghe, Yiyang, Xinye, and Xin'an counties have suffered bandit disasters and wars, with unspeakable carnage. Survivors are unable to care for their fathers and sons, brothers and wives are scattered, and they are unlikely to survive until morning or evening. They will soon be swallowed up by the ravines. In Songxian, Xinan, Xiangxiang, Wuyang, and Lushi counties, there has been hail and rain, and in Nanyang and Xinyang, heavy rain has caused disasters. These dozens of counties are suffering from water, fire, and war, and it is difficult to care for the present. The loss of property and food is beyond mention. What is even more bizarre is that the Zichuan County Government of Henan Province reported by express mail that the county borders Shaanxi and has many mountains and few fields. It was originally a war zone, and its vitality has been exhausted. Starting from June 28th, there were weeks of torrential rain, and mountain floods broke out. The height of the water was actually fifteen or sixteen zhang. According to villagers, when the flood occurred, they saw a unicorn with a horn over seven chi high, its back above the water, bright red like cinnabar. There was also a thing with its head two zhang above the water, flowing downstream like a galloping horse. It was also said that a few days before the rain in Dalianyu Xiangtan, there was a continuous loud noise day and night, shocking the residents, and in the fields, they picked up an earthen egg, as big as a stone roller, peeled open six layers, and yellow soup flowed inside, and it was not known what it was. Although water monsters are not credible, the villagers have actually seen them and dare not withhold them from their superiors. With such disasters, the people will all die in the ravines. The only thing to rely on for relief is a glimmer of hope. The county received an emergency relief of three thousand yuan from your association eighteen years ago, saving countless disaster victims. Now, a strange disaster has occurred again. We only hope that your association will save people thoroughly, issue tickets, and allocate funds to bring the dead back to life. We are weeping and wailing, and we don't know what to say. The association has received successive reports of strange disasters from Anhui, Henan, and other provinces. Letters are flying in like snowflakes, with a dozen arriving every day. Recently, the heavy rain has not stopped, and floods have occurred again in various counties of Jiangsu Province. It is estimated that there are about two or three hundred counties in the country that have reported or have not yet reported disasters. With such severe natural disasters, the association is truly unable to start. The lonely survivors are crying and have no tears.</p>

Recently, due to poor health, he resigned. However, local people and various agencies have repeatedly tried to retain him, but Wang's determination to leave is firm. He has reportedly arrived in Shanghai for recuperation and will continue to serve the Party and the country for the will of the Premier when the time is right.</p>

<h3>Ji Surname Offers Reward for Lost Child</h3>
<p>Ji Yingzhou, a resident of Cunren Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, had a six-year-old boy named Ji Xiaorong, who was very lively and loved by his parents. The child suddenly went missing while playing at the entrance of the lane the day before yesterday morning. A frantic search was conducted everywhere, but to no avail. The child's mother has been acting foolishly since the child went missing, refusing to eat or drink, crying incessantly, and suffering from a nervous breakdown. Yingzhou, seeing that his wife is about to go crazy and that there is no trace of the child, is extremely anxious and has drafted a sincere reward notice. Anyone who brings the child back will be rewarded with one hundred yuan and will not be prosecuted for his background in order to preserve the family of others.</p>
<h3>Gong Yannan Case to be Investigated</h3>
<p>Gong Yannan (also known as Gong Yannan) from Zhujiaqiao, Nanhui, was previously the captain of the 4th Anti-Smuggling Team. He was previously reported to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters by Tang Yucang, head of the Zhujiao Township Defense Corps in the county, for colluding with bandits. The headquarters ordered the Nanhui County Government to investigate and reply, and it was confirmed that he was colluding with bandits. The headquarters sent a letter to the Songjiang Transport Deputy, and Gong was detained, handed over by the Nanhui County Government, and transferred to the headquarters for interrogation. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. Now it is learned that Gong's wife, Mrs. Gong Chen, petitioned the headquarters because her husband had been detained for a long time without being released, requesting redress and recounting the previous situation of grievances between her husband and Tang, requesting redress, etc. It is reported that the Garrison Headquarters has approved the investigation.</p>
<h3>Chen Miaofu Stabbed</h3>
<p>At about 9:10 PM last night, Chen Miaofu, a boatman from Pudong, 21 years old, and a pancake shop owner, Mr. Jia, gathered many people at the Xinglong Garden Teahouse on Xiamen Road to reason. Unexpectedly, they disagreed, and Mr. Jia's side immediately took out a pistol to intimidate them. Chen's friends all looked at each other in dismay and had to run away. Mr. Jia grabbed Chen Miaofu and beat him severely, stabbing Chen's chest, face, and head severely. The murderer then left in a swagger. After the injury, Western Patrol No. 259 arrived and took him to Renji Hospital for treatment by car.</p>

<h3>Shanghai is Truly Dangerous: A Country Girl Nearly Falls into a Pit of Fire</h3>
<p>▲Rickshaw Puller Suddenly Has Bad Intentions</p>
<p>▲Wuxi Woman Nearly Falls Victim to a Plot</p>
<p>▲Thin and Fat Rogues Use Evasive Language</p>
<p>▲Guangdong Brothel Owner Once Investigates</p>
<p>Zhuang Zhenying, a woman from Wuxi, is twenty-nine years old and has a slightly attractive appearance. Because she lived with her stepmother in Qingguo Lane in her hometown, she was often abused. Her father, Zhuang Zhenbao, works as a partner in the Zhufu Chang Iron Shop on Wuchang Road in Hongkou, Shanghai. Zhenying took the Shanghai-Ningbo train to Shanghai the morning before yesterday to find her father, but being unfamiliar with the place, she did not know where Wuchang Road was. She mistakenly walked to Wuma Road, and feeling tired, she hired a rickshaw pulled by Zhu Debiao, a Jiangbei native, asking him to take her to the iron factory on Wuchang Road. Passing Peng Road, she happened to be seen by Gu Ziquan, a fellow villager, who inquired about her situation. He advised her to return home because</p>
<p>There are many bad people in Shanghai, and it is very dangerous. If she is afraid of her stepmother's abuse, she can stay at his house temporarily and look for work in a silk factory, asking her to take the train back home at the North Railway Station. However, the details were heard by the rickshaw puller Zhu Debiao, who suddenly had bad intentions. He dragged Zhenying to the Xian Road area and walked slowly, intending to</p>
<p>Plan to sell her off, but Zhenying also suddenly changed her mind and did not want to return home. She asked Zhu Debiao to go to Wuchang Road to find her father. The rickshaw puller Zhu heard her words and felt it was just what he wanted. He stopped at the entrance of the Xian Inn at No. 1911 on that road and told Zhenying to stay at the inn temporarily. Then, the rogue Tongji Sang Xiaorizi and Xu Erhuzi explained the origin of Zhenying to the innkeeper, using the false name of Guo Baoshan, and arranged for her to stay in Room 20,</p>
<p>Falsely claiming to find her father on her behalf. However, Sang and Xu saw that Zhenying was young, ignorant, and pretty. Each had intentions of taking advantage of her. When Xu waited for Sang to leave the room, he said to Zhenying, "If you marry me, I will buy you a silk cheongsam to wear, buy you high-heeled leather shoes to wear, and give you a gold ring to wear," coaxing her in every way. Zhenying lowered her head and did not speak. After a while, Xu left and Sang entered, also saying to Zhenying, "I don't have a wife yet. If you agree to follow me, I will buy you beautiful clothes and take you to Xinxin Amusement Park." Soon, Zhu Debiao returned and advised Zhenying,</p>
<p>If you love a fat man, you should marry Xu Lang. If you love a thin man, you should marry Sang Lang. It's up to you to choose. If things work out, I will benefit. Please help me. But Zhenying did not answer. They knew that she was unwilling and could not be forced. After lunch, they went to the Guangdong brothel at No. 1167 on the same road and told the brothel owner Chen Ali that there was a woman from Wuxi, Zhuang Zhenying, in the Xian Inn who was willing to work as a prostitute. They asked her to observe her appearance, and if she was suitable, they would discuss the price. Madam Chen and a guest named Guang Sheng went to the inn at about 4:00 PM,</p>
<p>Examining Zhenying's appearance, once, and briefly talking to Zhu, Sang, and Xu, but they could not resolve the matter and left. At about 7:00 PM, Huatan An Siban and Zhao Lianbi from the Hongkou Police Station went to the inn to check the passengers. When they arrived at Room 20, they saw a woman and three men inside, and their behavior was suspicious. They arrested the three men and asked Zhenying about the situation. They went to the Guangdong brothel and arrested the brothel owner Chen Aliu, and took them to the police station for detention. The next morning, they were escorted to the Third Court of the Special Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan, the representative of the police station, stated the case and asked for a strict investigation. Then, the woman Zhuang Zhenying</p>
<p>Testified on the circumstances, and her father, Zhuang Zhenbao, also claimed to be working as a buyer of old goods at the Zhufu Chang Iron Shop on Wuchang Road. His hometown is Zhenjiang, and Zhenying was born to his former wife. She came to Shanghai to find him, and he knew nothing about it. It was only after the police detectives notified him. Zhenying's childhood name is Zhaodi, and there are still his old mother and stepmother in his family. Zhang Axiang, the tea waiter at the Xian Inn, also claimed that the woman Zhuang Zhenying and the three defendants Zhu Sangchu arrived at the same time yesterday morning and opened Room 20.</p>
<p>I don't know their intentions. The room was opened under the false name of Guo Baoshan, and I don't know anything else. The three defendants, Zhu, Sang, and Xu, were evasive in their confessions, denying that they had conspired to sell Zhenying into prostitution. However, Guangdong woman Xu Aliu confessed that she did not know any of the three men, Zhu, etc. She did go to the inn with Guang Sheng at the time and did not want to buy Zhenying for prostitution. She is not a brothel owner, but a helper in that place, and she begged for understanding. Judge Xiao Xieffen reviewed the confessions and ordered them to be returned to prison for sentencing on a fixed date. The woman Zhenying was taken back by her father Zhuang Zhenbao.</p>
<h3>A Chorus of Bitter Rain</h3>
<p>▲Minhang Already Shows Signs of Disaster</p>
<p>▲Old Farmers Eagerly Await Sunny Skies</p>
<p>▲Observatory Reports Rainfall: Lately, Continuous Rainfall... The mildewed rain causes low-lying areas to become inundated. People lament the rain, and signs of famine have emerged. Not only is the rain heavy, unseen in many years, but occurring during the hot summer, it has lasted for ten days, bringing a chill like deep autumn, which is rare even among the elders. According to records from the Xujiahui Observatory, from the 18th to the 25th, the rainfall in eight days totaled seven inches, nearly one-seventh of the annual rainfall. From New Year's Day to the present, it has totaled 37.71 inches. Records from the past 58 years show an average rainfall of only 27.53 inches during the same period, while this year has exceeded the average by more than ten inches. It is no wonder that rivers in various places are full and reports of flooding are frequent.</p>
<p>▲Signs of Disaster Already Seen in Minhang Town: Wu Jingqing, the district head of Minhang Town, recently reported to the county government on behalf of the district's farmers, saying that the cool and rainy weather has already shown signs of disaster, and requested that relief measures be planned in advance. The report stated that since the beginning of summer, the weather in the district has been drastically changing, with temperatures dropping, followed by heavy rain that has lasted for ten days. The rainfall has suddenly increased by two to three feet, causing cotton fields to be flooded and overgrown with weeds, while the rice paddies have also suffered from the unusual cold, slowing their growth. Such a situation has been seen only in the past decade or so. If the cold rain does not stop, it will inevitably lead to famine. The people, already in dire straits after years of disaster and civil unrest, are feeling extremely desolate. It is difficult to bear further suffering. In addition to personally comforting the village heads and encouraging the people to listen to fate and wait quietly for the weather to clear, it is appropriate to truthfully report the cold and rainy conditions and request your superiors to review and plan for relief, for the sake of public convenience.</p>
<p>▲Old Farmers Eagerly Await Sunny Skies: In the four southwestern rural areas of this city, cotton fields account for 70%, bean fields for 20%, and rice paddies for 10%. Previously, due to many days of rain, the higher terrain prevented flooding. However, because the cotton fields were too wet to weed, farmers were busy pulling weeds in the fields. The bean and rice crops had not suffered significant damage. Unexpectedly, since yesterday, torrential rain has fallen, and the water in the ditches has connected with the farmland. Yesterday, we saw that low-lying fields in the Caoxing, Pufa districts of this city, and the Zhuanbei and Maqiao areas of Shanghai County, had become inundated. The water level was two to three inches above the ground, causing the cotton fields, already plagued by weeds, to suffer further flooding. Farmers, with no hope for the autumn harvest, were lamenting to the heavens. According to the old farmers, they hope that the weather will clear immediately and the accumulated water will recede quickly. However, the cotton fields have already suffered more than half the damage, and most of the bean seedlings have been submerged and cannot be revived. If the rain continues, it is feared that it will lead to a major famine like the Tongzhi era of the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>▲Farmhouses Collapsed by Wind and Water: The previous night, thunder and lightning were intertwined, and the gale was even stronger. In the southwestern rural areas of this city, such as Caoxing, Pu, Song, and villages along the western edge to Qibao, farmhouses were collapsing everywhere due to wind and water. Most of these farmers' houses are old and dilapidated, and because of the long period of rain, they have become damp and unstable. The pillars are shaking, and they cannot withstand heavy rain and gales. Alas, our farmers, who have toiled all year round, have no hope for the autumn harvest, and have suffered the tragedy of collapsed houses. People have no place to live, like birds with overturned nests. We now know that the local officials in charge of rural affairs are inspecting the disaster situation and reporting to their superiors.</p>
<p>▲Navigation Between Kunshan and Taicang Interrupted: There used to be regular liners between Kunshan and Taicang, and between Taicang and Anting. Recently, due to the sudden rise in river water, the bridges are close to the water surface, and ships cannot pass. In addition, the riverbanks in various places have collapsed, making navigation quite dangerous. Passengers to the inland ports have no way to connect with the trains. Therefore, Taicang, Louqin, Yu Da, Guangli, and other shipping companies have implemented temporary remedial measures, opening the Shaxi-Taicang route. It departs from Shaxi at 7:00 AM every day, arrives in Taicang at 9:00 AM, and connects with the Tai-Liu route at 4:30 PM, returning to Shaxi. The Tai-Liu route departs from Taicang at 9:30 AM every day, arrives at Liuhe at 12:30 PM, connects with the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus, departs from Liuhe at 1:30 PM and returns to Taicang at 4:30 PM, connecting with the Shaxi route, so that passengers can continue their journey.</p>
<h3>New Rules for the Shanghai Race Club's Grand Champagne Lottery</h3>
<p>▲To Be Implemented This Autumn</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Shanghai Race Club has recently issued a notice to its members, stating that it plans to change the Grand Champagne lottery for the spring and autumn seasons, merging the A and B types, issuing a total of 125,000 numbers, each priced at ten yuan, and expanding the number of prizes to 626. The first, second, and third prizes will all have double numbers. If all tickets are sold, the first prize will be 210,000 yuan, the second prize 60,000 yuan, and the third prize 30,000 yuan. Numbers drawn for qualified horses will be the fourth prize, totaling 120 numbers, each receiving approximately 1,250 yuan. Numbers drawn for unqualified horses will be the fifth prize, totaling 500 numbers, each receiving approximately 500 yuan. In the future, only numbers will be issued, not physical tickets. Each session will have a subscription list for members to purchase. These new rules are expected to be implemented this autumn.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Municipal Government's Land Acquisition</h3>
<p>This time, in the municipal district's land bidding, Shanghai Bank acquired twenty plots, totaling more than three hundred acres. To others, it may seem that the bank acquired a disproportionate amount of land, but in fact, it was a joint trust acquisition by a group. According to the regulations for this land bidding, the municipal government initially feared that no one would be interested, so it initially bid for more than eight hundred acres. By 7:00 AM, more than three hundred people had arrived, and soon, several hundred more people came. Each person wanted to acquire fifty or one to two hundred acres. This exceeded the municipal government's expectations. At that time, because there was little land and many people, it was impossible to allocate it. The mayor was consulted, and it was decided to use a lottery system. Those who drew the first ticket would be given priority to acquire land, but they had to pay a quarter of the deposit on the spot. If there was land left over, those who drew the second ticket would acquire it, and so on, until all the land was sold. After this method was announced, those with quick minds, fearing that they would not draw a ticket, were completely disappointed. They temporarily sought acquaintances and formed groups, along with groups from various companies, totaling more than ten groups. Shanghai Bank, as the first to support the municipal government's plan to revitalize the central district, had sent personnel to conduct detailed investigations in the area several times in advance. On that day, the bank also sent personnel to acquire land. The groups temporarily elected the bank as their representative, specifying the number of acres they wanted to acquire. No matter who drew the ticket, it had to be allocated openly. A certain gentleman who drew the first ticket did not have enough cash and left after acquiring one plot. The second ticket happened to be drawn by a member of this group. The bank, therefore, represented the group and acquired twenty plots. It is now heard that the groups have been allocated more than three hundred acres, while Shanghai Bank itself only acquired forty-three acres, half of which has been sold to its staff for the construction of housing, so that staff can live together in unity, and the other half is planned for the construction of municipal housing to revitalize the city's commercial district, which is still in the planning stage. The bank's plan is purely to support the municipal government's efforts to promote the prosperity of the Chinese business district and has no intention of profiting. The municipal government's creation of this great policy, which has gained the trust of the citizens, is also unprecedented. However, since the citizens have considerable faith in the municipal government, the municipal government should also exert its strength to seek happiness for the residents. It is hoped that in the future, all municipal matters in the area, such as roads, ditches, security, and sanitation, will satisfy the people and live up to their expectations.</p>
<h3>Stockholders' Meeting of the Securities and Goods Exchange</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange held its 23rd general meeting of shareholders yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. A total of 55,227 shares were represented. Chairman Yu Qiaqing presided over the meeting, observing due protocol. First, the chairman announced the opening remarks, followed by Director Wen Lanting reporting on the progress of events, Director Sheng Pihua reporting on the business situation, and Supervisor Yang Heqing reporting on the revenue and expenditure accounts. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Construction of Heping Road to Begin Early Next Month</h3>
<p>The municipal authorities' plan to rebuild Zhaojia Road as Heping Road, opening up Yi Lane and directly connecting to Route Lafayette to the west, has been under investigation by the Public Works Bureau for years, identifying municipal properties along the route that are obstructing the project. Around August last year, the Municipal Public Works Bureau ordered more than twenty owners and residents along the route to find new locations and relocate, demolishing the old houses. The bureau also bought them at the appraised market price. The demolition of the old houses along the route is expected to be completed by the end of this month, and construction will begin in early August. The leveling of the ground will be carried out by the Municipal Public Works Bureau, hiring regular workers to construct the surface, which will be paved with asphalt. It is estimated that the project will be completed within three months. After the completion of this project, which will connect the eastern end of Zhaojia Road to the Great Pier Street, the bureau will continue with the eastern section, renovating Great Pier Street, directly reaching the Bund of the Huangpu River. After the entire route is completed, the original road names will be abolished and completely renamed Heping Road.</p>
<h3>The Drama Society's Welcome Banquet for Qian Jianqiu</h3>

During the banquet, Pan Yangyao first delivered a welcoming speech, followed by speeches from Shen Gao, Wang Yuqing, Yuan Yeyu, and others. They generally hoped that Dr. Qian Jianqiu, after completing his studies and returning to China, would be able to apply his knowledge to the social security and human rights aspects.

Finally, Dr. Qian Jianqiu and Dr. Huang Biying delivered thank-you speeches, reported on their life in the United States, and discussed the spirit of theater research among people in that country.

<h3>Suspension of Route 4 Buses</h3>
<p>▲To Be Implemented on August 1st</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai South Public Bus Company has been competing with foreign companies to reclaim rights and interests. It has added Route 3 buses running on the Republic Road in the French Concession, and opened Route 4 buses to the airport on Hongqiao Road, which was built across the border by the British. The results have been good. Recently, due to continuous rain, the road surface has been badly damaged. After repeated consultations between the British Public Works Department and the Municipal Government, it is planned to rebuild the original road surface outside the boundary. With the understanding of the Municipal Government, construction will begin soon. Therefore, the Sino-British Route 4 buses are scheduled to be suspended from August 1st.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Founding Meeting of the Dayong Rubber Company</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Dayong Rubber Company held its founding meeting at No. 144, East Seward Road. The Social Affairs Bureau sent Yu Tianbi to supervise the meeting. A total of 1,729 shares were represented. The meeting began at 3:00 PM, observing due protocol. The shareholders elected Jian Yingfu as the chairman. The chairman reported on the progress of the preparations, stating that the company was initiated in the autumn of 1930, and began soliciting shares in November of the same year. A factory site was leased at No. 30, Dissway Road, Central Hongqiao. It was originally planned to raise 100,000 yuan in shares, which would be the responsibility of the promoters to raise. Later, because the products were welcomed by customers and supply could not meet demand, the original capital was insufficient for development, so it was changed to 200,000 yuan. Therefore, machinery was purchased and raw materials were added, and after several months of progress, the preparations were completed. Construction began at the end of March, manufacturing sports shoes. In March and April, 53,000 pairs were produced, in May 45,000 pairs were produced, and in June 75,000 pairs were produced. Because there was too much demand for women's shoes on the market, printed women's shoes were added. The daily output still could not meet demand. At the beginning of operation, the output and sales had such results, which is truly a consolation to our shareholders. At present, all the machinery in the factory has been installed, including one large-sized rolling machine and four small-sized rolling machines. There are also two small-sized rolling machines that will be installed during the day. After that, the daily output will be 200 dozen sports shoes, 150 dozen women's shoes, and 50 dozen rubber-soled basketball shoes. As for sales, Shunfa and Xinyi are the general managers, who guarantee sales on a monthly basis. This is a brief overview of the preparations and the current business situation. Next, the draft articles of association were discussed. The chairman read them item by item, made slight revisions, and the rest were passed. The chairman then asked the shareholders to vote to elect directors and supervisors. The shareholders elected Pan Ziyi and Wu Shuping as supervisors and ballot counters. The results of the ballot count were that Chen Lianbo, Jian Yujie, Jian Yingfu, Lao Jingxiu, Li Hui, Zeng Gongluo, Shen Ziliang, Liu Weijun, and Gong Yuting were elected as directors, and Jian Qingman and Pan Ziyi were elected as supervisors. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>Zhao Guanqing, a Suzhou businessman residing in Shanghai, previously hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the French Court against Bei Runsheng, a major paint merchant, for failing to repay a loan of over one million yuan. After Judge Gong ordered the original and accused parties to be questioned together, the court ruled against Zhao Guanqing. Zhao, dissatisfied with the judgment, continued to hire lawyer Zheng Yuxiu, presented reasons for his dissatisfaction, and requested a retrial from the French Court. This has now been approved and is currently being heard. Friends from both sides have come forward to mediate. The negotiations resulted in Bei repaying Zhao 150,000 yuan in cash as a fundamental solution. The settlement agreement has now been finalized by lawyers Jin Yu, Huang Huansheng, and others, and will be signed this afternoon at 2:00 PM. Then, the lawyers handling the case will jointly request the French Court to dismiss the case.

<h3>A Transformation in the Xu Family</h3>
<p>▲Xu Miaogen Unable to Fulfill Filial Piety</p>
<p>▲Yang Laoji Falsely Accuses Wife of Adultery</p>
<p>The resident Xu Miaogen, residing at No. 710, Zhaojia Road, within the West Gate, had an incident of assaulting his mother and insulting his sister, making false accusations of adultery, and injuring Zhu Ying, a clerk at the Dadi Chun Pharmacy, leading to litigation. Details follow:</p>
<p>▲The Xu Family: Xu Zhangshi is 56 years old, a local, with one son and one daughter. The son's name is Xu Miaogen, and the daughter's name is Cui'e. Her late husband left behind two municipal houses, namely No. 710 Zhaojia Road, the downstairs of which is rented to Dadi Chun Pharmacy, and the family lives upstairs. The house is managed by the son, Miaogen.</p>
<p>▲The Fierceness of the Son and Daughter-in-Law: Xu Miaogen is now 30 years old. His wife, Zhu, is quite fierce, has three children, and treats her mother-in-law with disrespect, often scolding her harshly. Her son, Miaogen, also assists in his wife's actions, so his mother does not have enough to eat and can only swallow her grievances in silence.</p>
<p>▲Cui'e's Situation: The daughter's name is Cui'e, now 33 years old. She married Yang Laoji, who ran a shoe store in Li Family Bay, Yinxiang Port, at the age of 19. The couple's feelings seemed good, but because Yang took a concubine, they lost harmony. She returned to her mother's house and has been there for seven years.</p>
<p>▲Three People Injured: Last night at 9:00 PM, Miaogen scolded his mother and sister downstairs for a trivial matter, and then started hitting them. At that time, the Dadi Chun Pharmacy was in the process of pouring out essence of flower dew. Fearing that the dispute would knock over the stove and cause a disaster, clerk Zhu Ying stepped forward to mediate. Miaogen and his wife immediately transferred their anger to Zhu, falsely accusing Zhu of having an affair with Cui'e, and insulted and scolded Zhu. Later, at 4:00 AM, they gathered many people and broke into the store. Zhu was sleeping inside the store and was dragged out and beaten severely, covered in injuries. The colleagues called the police, who took Zhu and Xu to the First Branch of the Second District. After questioning by the chief, they were released on bail.</p>
<p>▲Instigating Brother-in-Law to Catch Adultery: After Xu Miaogen was released, he hated his sister and went to his brother-in-law Yang Laoji and reported that his wife was having an affair with Zhu Ying, urging him to go and catch them in the act. Yang believed it to be true and led a group of people in a car to Zhaojia Road. After investigating the situation, he realized he had been fooled and had to make excuses to take his wife back. Cui'e, seeing her husband coming on so aggressively, was unwilling to return home unconditionally. Yang suspected his wife of having an affair with Zhu and immediately started dragging her, and also beat his mother-in-law and Cui'e severely. The neighbors were stirred up and watched. The police noticed and arrested both parties. After questioning, Yang Laoji was found to have used informal means to take his wife back and beat her, violating the police regulations, fined two yuan, and released on bail.</p>
<p>▲Zhu Ying Severely Injured: Zhu Ying was unjustly accused, insulted, and severely injured, and felt really unwilling. He immediately filed a lawsuit with the District Court to request an injury examination, and then filed a criminal lawsuit against Xu Miaogen. It is heard that Zhu's injuries are quite serious and he is seeking treatment at the Nanyang Hospital. However, the neighbors all sympathize with his mother and sister. Xu Miaogen and his wife Zhu have fled to the home of relatives.</p>
<h3>The Result of the Shi Xiangyun Family's Child Adoption Case</h3>
<p>▲The Child is Returned to the Owner</p>
<p>▲All Defendants Acquitted</p>
<p>Zhu Changqi, who has a vendor stall at the entrance of Tongkang Lane at the intersection of Republic Road in the French Concession, brought his seven-month-old adopted son to the stall to play on the 28th of last month. Because Zhu wanted to take care of his business at the stall, he could not take care of his son. Unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, the child suddenly disappeared. He immediately reported to the police and requested an investigation. French police detectives learned that the child was taken and raised by Zhang Meiyun, who lived at No. 46 Tongkang Lane, and sang Tanhuang. They then went to Zhang's home, took Zhang Meiyun and Zhang's aunt Zhu Shi, Zhang's daughter Zhang Mituo, to the police station, and recovered the boy. They were brought to the Criminal Court of the French Court for questioning the day before yesterday. Zhu Changqi first complained about the child's disappearance. Zhang Meiyun testified that the plaintiff's child was crying at the entrance of the alley, not wearing a single thread. It happened that a woman's daughter, Mituo, went out to buy things and suspected that he had been deliberately abandoned by another family, so she took him back to raise him, and had no intention of abduction. She asked for a clear understanding. The Chinese and Western judges acquitted all the defendants, and the child was returned to the plaintiff.</p>
<h3>Car Crash Death Case</h3>
<p>▲Driver Sentenced to Three Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhao Changjiang, a Yangzhou native working as a driver for the Zhang Faji Transportation Company at No. 274, Mowhai Road, was driving truck No. 17015 on the 15th of this month at around 6:00 AM. Due to the driver's carelessness, he ran over a six-year-old boy named Jin Hai, the son of a Guizhou woman Zhang Shenshi, near the Xiaocai Chang on Hankow Road. The boy was injured in the waist and died. Chinese police officer No. 2696 and Western police officer No. 25 from the Hongkou police station arrived and detained Zhao for questioning and imprisonment in the Special District Court. Yesterday, Judge Feng Shide opened the Third Court for hearing. According to the presentation of the case by lawyer Li Zhishan from the police station, and the investigation during the adjournment, it was determined that the defendant was driving in violation of the route, which caused the child to be run over and killed. At that time, the right wheel rolled over the child's waist, and he did not stop for more than twenty feet, showing that he was driving very fast. The drawn map of the accident site was presented for inspection. According to the testimony of the woman Zhang Shenshi, she was leading her son Jin Hai from north to south, and the defendant's car was speeding from east to west without honking its horn. First, he knocked me down, and then ran over Jin Hai, killing him, and did not stop. She also hired a lawyer to argue, requesting punishment of the defendant, and for the civil part, requested compensation for consolation money of 10,000 yuan. The defendant firmly stated that he was not driving fast at the time and did not see the child fall to the ground. He only knew after the worker on the car told him. The rest of the testimony was evasive. He also hired a lawyer to defend him. After reviewing the testimony, Judge Feng sentenced Zhao Changjiang to three months in prison. The number of days of detention before the judgment was final will be deducted at the rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The civil lawsuit filed by the plaintiff will be transferred to the civil court for trial.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife Quarrel, Jump into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>▲Fortunately, Shu Wengshi Did Not Die</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, the ferry from the Fenshan Wharf in Pudong, carrying about 20 men and women passengers from Puxi, returned to Pudong. Unexpectedly, after sailing to the middle of the river, a middle-aged woman among the passengers threw herself into the river to commit suicide. Her body sank and floated again. The boatman managed to rescue her and sent her to the police station at the pier, who took her to the Fourth Detachment of the Police. She changed her wet clothes and was transferred to the Third District of the Lan Nidu Public Security Bureau. According to the woman's statement, her name is Shu Wengshi, she is 28 years old, from Ningbo, and lives at No. 282, Gongping Road, Hongkou. Her husband's name is Shu Xinyou, and she has an eight-year-old son. Because the husband and wife were not in harmony, she was abused by her husband, unable to bear the pain, so she embraced pessimism and jumped into the river to commit suicide. Unfortunately, she was rescued. The district chief, considering that her family lived in the concession, ordered the woman to be transferred to the headquarters in the afternoon.</p>

Wang notified Shi’s wife, Madam Guan, who arrived at the scene to search for the body but could not find it. She cried bitterly and accused the foreman, Jiang Longxi, of using an unstable gangplank, causing her husband to fall into the river and drown. She harassed Jiang relentlessly. The patrol police stationed at the wharf took Jiang and Madam Guan to the Third District. Shi’s body was recovered with a grappling hook in the evening.

<h3>Qibao Town After the Fire</h3>
<p>Qibao Town, west of Shanghai, suffered a devastating fire on the night of the 18th of this month, caused by the carelessness of Chengchang Foreign Goods Store, which spread to more than twenty neighboring businesses, including Hengsheng Clothing Store. The losses are estimated at around 100,000 taels of silver, marking a significant disaster for the town. Furthermore, very few stores had fire insurance, adding to the financial burden.

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the news of the assassination attempt on Vice President Song of the Executive Yuan at the North Railway Station on the 23rd of this month, as reported by various newspapers, and the arrest warrant issued by the Public Security Bureau today, there is much misunderstanding about the railway police's management of station security and the division of authority between the Public Security Bureau and the railway police. The checking of travelers at the three main entrances of the North Station (east, west, and south) has always been the responsibility of soldiers from the Zhejiang-Shanghai Garrison Command and police officers from the Fifth District of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. The Station Inspection Office of the Garrison Command was recently abolished. On July 2nd, Order No. 1109 of the Garrison Command clearly stipulated that the task of checking travelers at the station be assigned to police officers from the Public Security Bureau. On the 22nd, when Vice President Song arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing, we did not receive a telegram due to a disruption in the railway telegraph lines. Only when the night train arrived did we see Vice President Song disembark. We immediately dispatched Police Chief Zhao Xinzong and Police Officer Lu Youcai to provide protection. When the assassin threw the bomb, the railway police had no firearms and could not retaliate with bare hands. They closely followed and protected Vice President Song, assisting him to quickly ascend to the second floor of the Management Bureau to take refuge. Vice President Song should still remember the collar badges and cap emblems of the railway police protecting him, as well as his inquiries to me about the situation. At that time, in addition to sending police to protect Vice President Song, I also summoned the off-duty police officers to the station to supervise and maintain order and to apprehend the assassin. However, at that time, four passenger trains were departing from our station, and the night express train from Nanjing was arriving, with passengers crowding the station. Upon hearing the alarm, they fled in confusion, disrupting order. With the smoke and chaos, it was impossible to identify the assassin's true identity, allowing the assassin to abandon his weapon and escape in the confusion, which is a great regret. After the incident, we recovered one Mauser pistol, two Browning pistols, and one unexploded bomb at the station. It is inconceivable that the assassin(s) could enter the station, given the strict inspection of prohibited items at the three main entrances. The railway police serving at the station, including those at the platforms and ticket offices, number less than ten, and are dedicated to maintaining order within the station and suppressing petty criminals. Although we were fortunate to protect Vice President Song's safety in this shooting incident, our lack of pre-emptive protection was due to insufficient police strength and our inability to resist heavily armed bandits with bare hands. Ultimately, we are ashamed of dereliction of duty. We have submitted a request to our superiors to take responsibility for the lapse. The railway police and the public security police are both police forces, and our duties are the same. The police officers from the Fourth and Fifth Districts of the Public Security Bureau have always worked in harmony and mutual support when handling incidents at the station, and there has never been a so-called issue of division of authority. The report that only one public security police officer was checking travelers at the station, with the rest at the Baoshan Road intersection, is somewhat inaccurate. This matter concerns the division of authority and the truth of the situation. I am therefore informing you of the station's historical situation and the facts of the incident, hoping that you will publish this to ensure accuracy and to address public concerns.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>He Jinxiu, Police Chief of the First Section of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, July 26th.</p>

<p>▲Second Day Doubles: French Team Wins Over British Team ▲</p>
<p>▲Championship Depends on Results of Perry vs. Cochet ▲</p>
<p>丨Yesterday's Singles Results丨</p>
<p>Paris, 26th - Davis Cup final. In the third day of singles, Britain's Austin defeated France's Borotra, 7-5, 6-3, 3-6, 7-5. In the first set, Borotra took an early lead of 3-0. Austin persisted and won the second set with short and long shots. In the third set, they were tied at 3-3 before Borotra won. In the final set, Austin won with powerful shots. After three days, Britain and France are tied at two-two. Who will win the championship depends on the results of Perry vs. Cochet.</p>
<p>丨Second Day Doubles丨</p>
<p>Paris, 25th - Davis Cup tennis, Britain vs. France, in the final for the championship. Today, the second day, the French doubles team won 3-1 against the British team, giving France a 2-1 lead. The outcome is still uncertain. The final two singles matches are evenly matched, and it is impossible to predict the winners before the match. The crowd was larger than on the first day. After the rain, the court was covered with sand.</p>
<p>▲French Doubles Victory Over Britain's Results</p>
<p>Cochet and Brugnon (France) 6-1, 5-7, 6-3, 8-6 beat Hughes and Kingsley (Britain)</p>
<p>Maintaining Strength, Britain Changes Strategy</p>
<p>The British doubles team has always been Perry and Hughes. However, Perry also has to play singles, holding two positions, and has to compete for three consecutive days. His strength will inevitably be greatly affected on the third day of singles. Perry's final singles match will also be against the strong Cochet. Therefore, team leader Barat changed his strategy, having Kingsley replace Perry in the doubles match, knowing that the doubles match would inevitably be lost to France. This was to preserve Perry's strength and prepare for a decisive battle with Cochet.</p>
<p>▲British Doubles Not Inferior</p>
<p>The Hughes and Kingsley doubles team was not inferior in strength. In the second set, they fought for twelve games and won 7-5. In the final set, they also fought hard for fourteen games, but unfortunately lost 6-8. The struggle was extremely fierce.</p>

<h3>Appraising the Japanese University of Commerce's Boasted First-Class Basketball Team (Lu Zhong'en)</h3>
<p>丨Combat Strength Still Strong丨Lacking in Artistic Aspects丨</p>
<p>▲Five Losses and Two Wins in Seven Matches丨A Mediocre Team After All</p>
<p>The University of Commerce basketball team, boasting itself as Japan's first-class, has come to Shanghai to challenge local teams seven times. Comparing its performance in the past matches with the strength of Shanghai's teams, it can only be considered mediocre. However, the team's combativeness is remarkably tenacious, worthy of praise. But in terms of artistic aspects, it still lacks refinement. Therefore, out of seven matches, it has won two and lost five. Now, I will briefly record my observations from each game for the readers to study.</p>
<p>(1) University of Commerce vs. Fan Hang: This was the first match for the University of Commerce. Fan Hang was unfortunately defeated due to incomplete personnel. On that evening, the University of Commerce did not appear exceptionally brilliant. Fan Hang's two guards were slightly weak, with errors frequently occurring in receiving and defense. As a result, Fan Hang unfortunately lost with a score of 34 to 31.</p>
<p>(2) University of Commerce vs. Eagle Team: In this match, the University of Commerce did not gain any advantage from beginning to end. Although the team fought fiercely, it missed many opportunities due to being too hasty. Shooting opportunities were often not grasped effectively. The three forwards of the Eagle Team were not seasoned veterans. Although Kong of Chizhi and Guangyi would lend their efforts, the audience generally felt there was no hope. Unexpectedly, after forty minutes of strenuous battle, the Eagle Team defeated the visiting team with a score of 34 to 25, a truly remarkable feat.</p>
<p>(3) University of Commerce vs. Artillery Team: The University of Commerce suddenly recovered its ability from the first night amidst a period of poor performance, overwhelming the Artillery Team. The Artillery Team consisted of skilled players, but their shooting skills were lacking, reducing their scoring opportunities. Ultimately, they could not achieve perfection, which was regrettable. At the end of the match, the University of Commerce secured its second victory with a score of 36 to 32.</p>
<p>(4) University of Commerce vs. Fudan United: Fudan United assembled a strong team composed of new and old students to resist the University of Commerce. The team's cooperation was commendable. Forwards Guo and Lu frequently attacked the enemy's basket, coupled with the inner defense's exhaustive efforts, finally repelling the enemy. The score was 26 to 19. In this match, both sides had many fouls, and the essence of the game was lost, making it somewhat flawed.</p>
<p>(5) University of Commerce vs. Red Light: Red Light was formed by merging Guanghua and the Red Team. The course of the battle was very similar to that against Fudan United. With an indomitable spirit and a stroke of luck, they seized the final victory. In this match, the University of Commerce appeared even more regressed than in the match against Fudan United. In the last six minutes, although it added the Far East warriors Ohashi and Ueda into the battle, it still ended in defeat. Poor shooting and the inability to adapt the offense to the situation were the biggest reasons for the Japanese team's repeated failures. In conclusion, Red Light 31, University of Commerce 27.</p>
<p>(6) University of Commerce vs. Chizhi: Chizhi, the champion of Jiangnan University, naturally had strength above that of the University of Commerce. Therefore, the University of Commerce exerted all its strength to cope. The competition between the two sides was very intense. The Chizhi team led all the way with its superior technique and accurate shooting. In the second half, University of Commerce unfortunately had its main player, Nagai, ejected from the game due to four fouls. Therefore, at the end of the match, the University of Commerce lost by twelve points (the score was 32 to 20). In this match, both sides were penalized a total of 28 times due to fierce competition, creating the highest number in the University of Commerce's challenge series.</p>
<p>(7) University of Commerce vs. Shanghai Chinese: The Shanghai Chinese basketball team, recognizing the immaturity of the University of Commerce's technique, decided to strive for variety in artistic aspects. The advantage of the University of Commerce lies entirely in its serious and persistent fighting spirit, charging straight ahead without any sense of change. Therefore, the Shanghai Chinese players embraced the principle of "I do not offend others" and used pure artistry to deal with the visiting team. In defense, recognizing the Japanese team's emphasis on close-range shots and basket rebounds, one side adopted the "Five Men Position Defence" method, while the other side closely monitored the Japanese team's only shooter, Mr. Nagai. In offense, one side used quick counterattacks (Quick Breaks) to attack unprepared opponents, while the other side used "Cut fns," "Bounce Pass," and shots within the free-throw area. The opposing team also talked about the same five-man defensive formation (Five Men Defence). If the University of Commerce had adopted the Shanghai Chinese's offensive techniques in the second half, it would not have lost by as many as thirty points.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the University of Commerce's expedition to Shanghai was far from what was expected. The skill of the so-called first-class team in Japan has been seen by us Chinese. We sincerely hope that Japan can send an invincible championship team to Shanghai next time to compete. Then the strength between China and Japan can be clearly understood.</p>
<p>The Allied forces launched a fierce attack like cannonballs. China's defense was not yet fully established. Suddenly facing a strong enemy, they were caught off guard, and the enemy broke through the central pass. The Portuguese player (Victor) was exceptionally brave, carrying the ball and flying in, taking advantage of the momentum to kick it diagonally. Chen at the goal was unable to save it in time. Thus, in less than five minutes, the Allied team first announced victory.</p>
<p>▲China Immediately Retaliates</p>
<p>China was caught off guard and conceded a goal. They were unwilling to let go and became as fierce as dragons and tigers, vowing to recover their territory. They fought fiercely for more than ten minutes, with no clear winner. Unexpectedly, trouble arose from a small incident. Li Ruchen secretly carried the ball, breaking through two lines of defense. Li Yi and Shuang Ma met the challenge, embracing into a ball. The ball flowed out from under Ma's belly. Lu Qiyuan was quick-eyed and quick-footed, and the ball flew like an arrow. Even the famous general Zhou Xianyan could do nothing. The score was tied.</p>
<p>▲Chinese Army Continues to Report Victory</p>
<p>After five minutes of switching positions and fighting again, the Allied army seemed to relax and lost the rhythm of passing, naturally giving others an opportunity. He Zuoxian was a good general and could not miss this opportunity, quickly assisting the front line to calmly carry out the attack. Mai Laodong went to the front line under orders, killing relentlessly, and Billy Cao lost his guard and was defeated. At the right time, he passed the ball from the middle, and the ball fell from the sky, directly attacking the goal. Sun Tie Tui (Jinshun) was in a favorable position and, abandoning his feet, used his head to strike diagonally, and the ball went into the net.</p>
<p>▲Dagaoshan Nu Scores a Goal</p>
<p>Not long after switching positions and fighting again, the Allied forces' military appearance was too strong. The five forwards lined up like wild geese and advanced bravely. China's central pass was broken, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense. Hai Jia Ball rode forward, full of energy, carrying the ball and flying in, like a dragon emerging from the water. Generals Huang and Liang met and engaged in a mixed battle. Chen immediately passed diagonally to the center forward. Dagaoshan Nu was originally a famous foreign general who seized the opportunity and regained the lost territory. His contribution was not small.</p>
<p>▲The Locomotive Actually Scores a Goal</p>
<p>China lost a goal unexpectedly. How could they be willing to have the meat in their mouths taken away? They urgently planned a counterattack and launched a series of attacks. Chen Pu kicked the ball in a hurry, and the Chinese army's attack was ineffective and retreated. The locomotive opened from the left pass for the second time, Billy Cao could not stop it, and directly approached the left corner and passed the ball straight down to the goal. The momentum was extremely urgent. Zhou Xianyan punched but could not stop it, and the ball directly penetrated the net. It was clear and beautiful.</p>
<p>▲Finally Tie the Score</p>
<p>The ball game reached this point, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense. Every move, forward or backward, won applause from ten thousand people. The Chinese ball team, with the record already at three to two, strictly defended their position, taking a defensive stance. The Allied team urgently deployed troops, trying to quickly recover their lost territory. Not long after, Chen Zhenhe carried the ball to attack, Chen Xipei came to meet him and tried to pounce, and the people and the ball rolled to the ground, embracing into a ball. Black Charcoal wanted to kick, but Xipei refused to let go. The referee blew a whistle, and the Allied team was relieved, judging it as a "fair ball." The ball was thrown into the air to see who would get it first. Black Charcoal was like a fish in the net and could not be allowed to escape. He pushed away with one foot, and the ball flew as ordered. Sure enough, the heavens did not fail those who worked hard, and he finally won the final victory. Soon after, the battle whistle blew, and the battle curtain slowly fell. A pair of inseparable friends fought to a draw, and they came as a team and left as a team.</p>

<h3>A New Aspect of Chinese Education</h3>
<p>丨Central Political School (I) Xingye</p>
<p>The strict curriculum, serious discipline, excellent school spirit, and rapid development of the Central Political School have gradually attracted the attention of society. This kind of school occupies a special position in the history of education, and its influence on the future politics of China will be considerable. I think that the general public in the country is happy to have an accurate and reliable understanding, so I have recorded it in detail for reference. According to the world's political schools, there are not many, and the most famous and only ones that can be counted are the French I'Fcocle des Sciences Politiques and the German Politische Hochschule. Both are university in nature and are in the same city as the University of Paris and the University of Berlin, and their level is the same. Coincidentally, the political school in Paris was established after the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 to seek political reform and restore France's lost international status after the Franco-Prussian War. The German political school was established after the Treaty of Paris in 1919, because at that time, the Germans only admitted that the previous war was not a military failure but a political failure. For the sake of political reform, in order to seek revival, the Central Political School of China happened to be established after the National Government made Nanjing its capital, when it was calling for the revival of the Chinese nation and the reform of Chinese politics. It is also the same university in level. Looking at the trajectory of its evolution, it is gradually tending towards being run as a French political school in particular.</p>
<p>When the National Government made Nanjing its capital, the Central Government felt the lack of practical workers, so it established the Central Party Affairs School. This school was the predecessor of the Central Political School. The training period of the Party Affairs School was one year. Although the level varied, many were university graduates and vocational school graduates. Soon after this class graduated, it was changed to the Central Political School, and the study period was combined into four years, recruiting graduates from registered high schools and university preparatory courses, and its level became the same as that of national universities. Moreover, strict enrollment is a special phenomenon of political schools. Now, the students in the first and second grades of the political school are selected from an average of fourteen people. Most of the professors are well-known figures at the time. Because the school is in the capital, in addition to full-time professors, it is also easier to hire professionals to serve as part-time lecturers. As far as the current situation is concerned, their treatment is higher than that of any university in the capital, and the qualifications for selection and appointment are also very strict. Originally, this school was divided into four departments: Administration, Finance, Local Autonomy, and Social Economy. Its classification was different from that of general universities. On January 1, 1920, after Luo Jialun returned to the school, he established the purpose of running the school as a French political school. He believed that this kind of division was still too broad, and if he wanted to cultivate specialized talents, he had to concentrate students' interests on the specialized schools they recognized. Otherwise, it would be the same as ordinary universities. On the one hand, it could not compare with foreign universities, so that students could have in-depth research on academic theories after graduation. On the other hand, it could not supply politics and society with practical needs. Everything could be done, but nothing could be done. Therefore, he set a fundamental plan to divide the departments into groups, so that students would have a need and object for their work in the subjects they wanted to study. Therefore, after determining the policy, he divided the original departments into groups. The Department of Administration was divided into three groups: General Administration, Law, and Diplomacy. The purpose of the Law Group was to cultivate judicial officers, prison officers, and personnel for administrative courts and supervisory courts. Because there were not many talents in China in the legal field, and after the abolition of consular jurisdiction in the future, the demand for judicial talents would be greater. In order to make the decisions of local courts in various places on civil and criminal lawsuits not subject to international public opinion, we need good judicial talents. The second is the General Administration Group, which focuses on the research of policy implementation and the knowledge of institutional management to increase administrative efficiency. The third is the Diplomacy Group, which focuses on the research of diplomatic issues and cultivates talents for embassies and consulates. The Law Group belongs to the Department of Administration purely as a historical evolution, and it may be established as a separate department in the future. Under the Department of Finance, two groups are set up: Financial Administration and Finance. The Financial Administration Group focuses on the implementation and planning of tax collection, tax forecasting, and auditing. The purpose of the Finance Group is to cultivate practical talents for monetary systems and national and public financial institutions. Further down is the Department of Local Autonomy, which is divided into four groups: Municipal Administration, Rural Administration, Land Administration, and Police Administration. The Municipal Administration Group focuses on urban design, police, public health, and relief issues. The Rural Administration Group focuses on rural administration, rural education, implementation of civil rights training, and forest protection issues. The Land Administration Group focuses on land surveying and registration, public land management, and the implementation of land law to cultivate talents for organizing national land. The Police Administration Group is to cultivate talents who can bear the responsibility of national public security. In addition to police administration, it also teaches sufficient legal knowledge and focuses on social investigation and statistics. The preparation of these two groups is more difficult, so they are temporarily postponed. The fourth is the Department of Social Economy, which is divided into four groups: Public Utilities, Cooperation, Statistics, and Industrial and Commercial Administration. The Public Utilities Group focuses on the management, operation, and supervision of public utilities. The Cooperation Group focuses on the guidance and operation of cooperative undertakings and related technologies. The Statistics Group focuses on the training of various statistical skills. The Industrial and Commercial Administration Group focuses on labor-capital arbitration, factory management, the implementation of factory supervision systems, and the improvement of foreign trade matters. This is the purpose of the establishment of each group and its teaching policy. By June of this year, with the permission of the Central Government, the Department of Education was added, divided into two groups: Educational Administration and Rural Education. The lack of educational administrative talents is already very obvious, and the need to promote rural education can be stated by those who speak about Chinese issues. The establishment of this department is also established to meet the needs of the country. The above is the situation of the school's undergraduate program. The undergraduate program is only up to the third grade, and there will be a fourth grade in the second half of the year, so the school has not yet had any graduates.</p>

<h3>A Small Chronicle of the World</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>The Museum of Brains</p>
<p>The strangest museum in the world. It has now been established in Vienna, the capital of Austria. It is attached to a scientific academy that studies human intelligence. It specializes in displaying human brains. The museum has obtained many brains of past geniuses. And almost a thousand living geniuses have also promised to send their brains to the museum for display after their death. The average European male brain weighs forty-five taels, and the average female brain weighs forty taels. Generally speaking, the more intelligent a person is, the heavier their brain is. The brain of the great British poet Byron weighed sixty taels. The brain of the great German philosopher Kant weighed fifty-five taels. And the brain of the great Russian writer Turgenev exceeded them, weighing as much as sixty-seven taels. To know the weight of the brain, there is no need to weigh it on a scale. You only need to measure the size of the skull to know the weight of the brain accurately. If you compare the brains of ancient people with the brains of modern people, the difference in intelligence is very large. The brains of Javanese orangutans and savage races all over the world are very light. But the brains of people in several places in ancient France two or three thousand years ago who invented flint to make fire and people who painted beautiful murals in Spanish caves also weighed as much as the brains of modern people. This cannot be generalized. There is also an exception to the exception, which is the record of the heaviest brain in the world, weighing seventy-seven taels, but it belongs to an idiot. Isn't it strange?</p>
<h3>A Nation Without Promise</h3>
<p>— Zhou Cailiang</p>
<p>Since the Wanbaoshan incident, hundreds of our Korean-Chinese compatriots have been killed. The expression of national economic severance with Japan is one way of doing things when there is no other way. It is sighing to say that weak countries have no diplomacy. Still remember Cai Yuanpei's crazy saying, "Being pro-Japanese is certainly not possible. Hating Japan is also not appropriate. But knowing Japan is the most effective." For the Japanese, China is almost at their fingertips. But our countrymen know nothing about them. I think knowing Japan is important, but knowing Korea is also essential. But if you want to know people's strengths and weaknesses, you must experience it personally. My friend Mr. Pan has just returned from traveling in Korea and has many feelings. He told me the following. The great reason for the fall of Korea is only three greed. The first is greed for food. Because they are greedy for food, they only know how to consume and do not know how to produce. The second is greed for laziness. Because they are greedy for laziness, nothing can be done. The third is greed for money. Because they are greedy for money, they are blinded by greed and do not know there is a country. The Japanese know this and deliberately make it so, gradually using them as puppets to oppose China. This kind of nation without promise is willing to be a tiger's accomplice. It is not surprising. I sincerely hope that the Chinese who live in independent countries will quickly know the reason why and prevent it from happening. In that case, even if the Japanese are cunning, I am afraid they will have no way to use their skills.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Juan)</p>
<p>Economic severance with Japan is the only method we can use when we have no other choice. If we can't even do this, and we can't even persevere to the end, then it's true that what the ancients called "There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart." There is also one important point, which is that those who preside over the inspection of goods must be selfless and upright. If they dare to accept a bribe of even one cent, it is tantamount to seeing Korean-Chinese compatriots being killed and then secretly eating the remaining pieces of meat and sipping the remaining blood. This kind of person is Chen Shubao, who has no heart or liver at all.</p>
<h3>The Fun of History and Geography Tests</h3>
<p>— Xue Qian</p>
<p>The purpose of having history and geography in schools is to understand the present by knowing the past. In fact, it is nothing more than understanding the process of life and the current situation. Therefore, except for universities that have specialized history and geography research, in middle and primary school students, it mostly belongs to common sense, which is necessary to know in fact, and should be included in the teaching materials. During this summer vacation, Shanghai Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School recruited new students. In addition to testing Sanmin Zhuyi, Chinese, and mathematics, history and geography are one type of common sense, and of course, they are also included in the test. But as a result, there are many errors in the answers. For example, when asked what time period Confucius lived in, some filled in Tang Dynasty, and some filled in Song Dynasty, accounting for four or five tenths of the total. Those who filled in the Zhou Dynasty could still understand his era. As for those who filled in the Spring and Autumn period, there were only one or two tenths. Also, when asked about the names of the Seven Heroes, some filled in England, America, Germany, France, Japan, Italy, and Austria. It can be said to be a big mistake. It is already very funny to even fill in Tang Wu as peasant revolution. And the two sons of Sima Yi, one named ○ and one named ○, one student filled in Sima Qian and Sima Guang, which are eight or nine hundred years apart, so the error is extremely extreme. Even more laughable, the question asked who was the most resourceful person in the Three Kingdoms period, and one student filled in the three characters "Shi Yi Hao." At first glance, it was unknown what he meant. After careful consideration, I suddenly realized that it was Zhuge Liang's mistake. Also, with the five ports of the Treaty of Nanjing, anyone should know their locations. Who would have thought that some would not be able to name them, or they would be incomplete, or the names would be mostly wrong. It can also be seen that common sense is lacking. As for the central area of Shanghai City being in ○○○, some filled in Nanjing and some filled in Guangzhou, and they still do not know the recent situation. As for the seven coastal provinces and the three major basins of the headquarters, they are even less clear. I remember last year there was a question to list the names of China's four major railway lines. A student taking the high school exam answered one Huanghuogan, two Huogan, and three Chihuogan. To investigate why there was such a big mistake, I took the question paper to read it. It turned out that the big character one stroke in the middle was slightly broken, and the student mistakenly thought it was the character fire, making a big mistake. Isn't it very laughable? In short, the history and geography tests for new students at Wuben Middle School this time found many interesting answers. What is recorded here is only the general outline. Someone felt the lack of common sense among students, so I slightly revealed its end and submitted it to this talk. I hope those who bear the responsibility of education will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>A New Song of Voice</h3>
<p>— Wild Rose</p>
<p>Among the new songwriters of our country, Mr. Li Jinhui is recognized as the most popular nationwide. However, Mr. Li's songs are most suitable for young girls and children. For adult men, it will reveal shyness. In addition to Mr. Li, there is also Mr. Du Tingxiu, who has been working hard on Chinese and Western music and has gained extensive knowledge. He can compose new sounds himself and vent his emotions according to the sadness and joy of the music. He also asks famous Confucians to fill in elegant and popular words, creating a unique style. He completely focuses on singing and does not fall into others' traps. Those who listen are all fascinated. I knew Mr. Du's name from the Nanjing Lizi Society. At that time, Mr. Du was serving as an officer of the society and was praised by famous figures in the Party and state. Scholars called him learned and talented. Previously, I read in newspapers that the Da Zhonghua Company published and issued Mr. Du's new song records. I was very happy that this musician could show off his ambitions, so I bought a set and listened to it first. I only felt that the sound was sonorous, the lyrics were concise, the strings and bamboo were melodious, and the meaning was superb. It can reveal the emotions emanating from the heart. Compared with the popular tunes of the time, such as the zither and the erhu, it has a different flavor. I believe it can be passed down. Also, Mr. Du has been influenced by Christianity for a long time. He deeply regrets that there are no records of hymns in our country. He specially hired the famous pianist Mr. Du Lihua from Qingdao to accompany him. At the same time, he recorded many hymns, which is also a unique masterpiece.</p>
<h3>Crying for Tang Yulu</h3>
<p>— Yan Enchun</p>
<p>I knew you were talented at fourteen. You were already outstanding in your youthful exuberance. People likened you to Wang Yi-fu upon first seeing you, saying you were a golden boy descended from the heavens. We shared the same hall with hundreds of others for three years. Only you, me, and Yuanlong remained. (Chen Yuanlong's misfortune with the Pujji steamboat happened fourteen years ago.) Now, I am but a traveler in a blue shirt, weeping in the autumn wind and rain.</p>
<p>Like Su Shi returning from overseas on a raft, we parted ways, each flying like swallows in different directions. I saw you briefly in front of the Fragrant Snow screen last year (I met you and Zhimo at the Shanghai Puyi Institute Art Exhibition last year. We exchanged a few words and then parted). Today, I linger dazedly under the moon.</p>
<p>To serve the country and sacrifice yourself was always your ambition. It is most pitiable to hear the market's confusion and hearsay. A dignified secretary of the Ministry of Finance, overturned and wrongly reported as Song Ziwen. (Yesterday's newspaper reported that Song Ziwen's secretary, a Mr. Tang, was shot and killed, hence this correction.) (Response)</p>
<p>▲Soliciting Couplets and Giving Books: Zhang Jun Linqiu, from a prominent Wuxing family. His grandfather and father were well-known for their political achievements. He also devoted himself to the Party and the nation, holding important military and political positions. He has a free and easy personality and loves to socialize. He has written many works throughout his life, but he is not willing to show them to others easily unless they are close acquaintances, just like his calligraphy. Last spring, Tan Yankai and others, recognizing the unique characteristics of his calligraphy, set a price list for him in Nanjing. However, the price was too high, and many who sought his calligraphy sighed in disappointment. Mr. Zhang has been in Shanghai for over a month since arriving from the capital. He believes that Shanghai is only about prosperity and bustle, not as interesting as Nanjing, which has more to offer. Recently, he created an initial line: "Descend from Nanjing, ascend to Shanghai, on the sea, exploring ends with a descent to Nanjing." If fellow literary enthusiasts are willing to contribute a matching line, he will reward them with a book (fan inscription or couplet, according to their preference). Please submit your contributions to Mr. Rui Hongchu at the Ming Shangdian store on Nanjing Road, Shanghai. (Hongyan Pavilion Master)</p>
<h3>Random Talks on American Women's Life (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Ms. Qian Jianqiu recently returned from the United States. She majored in law at the Northwestern University Graduate School and earned a doctorate. We are not necessarily advocating for degrees, but seeing her sharp, capable, and possessing the spirit of a man, she is indeed a rising force in the Chinese women's community. During a recent meeting, I inquired about the recent situation of the American women's community. She kindly provided a detailed account, supplemented by her classmate, Mr. Huang Biying. Now, I will record it as follows.</p>
<p>▲Dress: American women mostly consider hair to be beautiful. Ordinary women over the age of sixteen like to perm their hair. Those over forty rarely do so. Since perming is so common, it seems to them to be as necessary as a man wearing a suit and tie. Every night before going to bed, they must wash their face with soap, followed by cleansing cream. This cream is volatile and can expand the pores of the hair, removing dirt from within. Then, they apply tissue cream. This is hygiene before bed, not for beauty. In the morning, they wipe it off, apply powder, and rouge. The powder is not limited to white, but also comes in light red, light yellow, and shades similar to the skin tone. These cosmetics are of pure quality and do not harm the skin. Those who are skilled at dressing up prefer products from Paris. Women there all pay attention to dressing up. Otherwise, they think they are being impolite. As for clothes, the latest style is long skirts that reach the ankles. In winter, they prefer black and long sleeves. In summer, they prefer white or various light colors, sleeveless. The fabric is mostly printed. They wear single layers all year round, but the fabric varies in thickness. The waist of the clothes is very narrow, while the chest is wide, making them easy to wear. The clothes and skirts are connected and without collars. They must wear a hat when going out. The style of the hat varies, and the color often matches the clothes and shoes. They are always dressed up for going out or attending banquets, but they do not pay attention to dressing up at home for the sake of convenience in doing housework.</p>
<p>▲Diet: American women all like to eat meat. However, in order to maintain their beautiful figure, they are afraid of eating too much fat, which can easily lead to obesity. Therefore, they do not dare to eat too much. They only eat one or two slices of meat per meal. Fish, shrimp, sweet potatoes, and vegetables are common side dishes. In addition, there is a type of canned food called "chop suey," which contains a large amount of meat and is cooked in a delicious way, very much to their liking. These canned goods are mostly made by overseas Chinese in New York and Chicago. They do not know how to cook it themselves. Therefore, overseas Chinese who make canned goods are making three times the profit. The number of these shops is also increasing daily. In addition to three meals a day, they also like to eat fruit, candy, biscuits, and coffee. Many also drink tea. They believe that tea can cleanse the spleen and stomach and remove grease. In the past, Chinese tea sold best in the United States. Now, Japanese tea and Indian tea are also gaining ground. It seems that pure, naturally good Chinese tea cannot compare to artificially selected and processed Japanese tea. It can be seen that no matter what it is, relying solely on the excellence of natural products without adding artificial refinement will easily be eliminated.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Story Series</p>
<h3>Women, Women (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>On the day of the closing ceremony, the girls' dormitory lost its usual tranquility. Companions greeted each other, said goodbye, and exchanged gifts, fully expressing the deep same-sex affection of women. Some even cried out loud, like lambs reluctant to leave their former residence and good companions.</p>
<p>But comedies were also being performed everywhere: Miss Wang took down the portrait of Valentino hanging on the wall above her bed and personally delivered it to Miss Pan, saying with a smile, "This is yours, your lover in dreams, I'm returning it to you!" Although Miss Pan's face showed some anger, one hand naturally accepted the portrait.</p>
<p>Also, the doorkeeper of the girls' dormitory, Mother Wang, accepted a two-cent bribe from a male student surnamed Zhu and delivered a sealed brocade box to Miss Xu. Miss Xu opened the box and found ten red eggs. She was furious, but the laughter of many people suppressed her anger. She simply threw the ten red eggs on the ground, which Mother Wang picked up.</p>
<p>In the midst of the chaotic scene, Miss Ding, who was known as the "Queen," was also organizing things on her desk. She remembered that at the beginning of the semester, everything was packed in two suitcases, but after four months, even four suitcases could not hold so many things: not to mention the added clothes, even a set of hair-curling tools and a makeup box for manicures also required more than one suitcase to hold.</p>
<p>Mother Wang suddenly came in and said, "Miss Ding, obviously you are sure 'Is it still that Mr. Zhu from yesterday? Just say I've gone home.'" Miss Ding clearly refused with certainty. Mother Wang obeyed and left.</p>
<p>Before long, Miss Ding had packed everything up: the suitcases were not enough, so she used blankets and mattresses as packages, but even those were not enough, so she had to sacrifice a few picture magazines that she usually kept.</p>
<p>Finally, she left this palace of youth, asked Mother Wang to hire a car, asked Mother Wang to carry the two suitcases, and carried two small bags herself, sending them into the car: there were also two large packages, but two unfamiliar men volunteered to carry them out for her; these two men were also students in the school. It is said that on this day, they came specifically to wait outside the girls' dormitory for the mission of assisting the female students.</p>
<p>On the playground, one could not hear the vigorous sound of ball games, but only two or three male students gathered and lingered on the only road from the girls' dormitory to the school gate. From the smiling voices that assaulted Miss Ding from the car window, she could still vaguely hear their praise for her lofty dignity.</p>

<h3>Financial: Gold Market Fluctuated Last Week</h3>
<p>▲The Future Holds More Drastic Changes</p>
<p>▲A Summary of the Entire Week: Last week, the gold market formed a swirling pattern, with changeable conditions and frequent fluctuations. Foreign news was mixed. At the beginning of the week, it was above 740 taels. Subsequently, due to the drop in silver prices, it suddenly broke through the 50-tael mark. However, the London Conference, with the German President ordering the minting of 500 million marks in silver currency and 100 million marks in copper currency to alleviate the financial crisis, caused panic. The price of gold almost collapsed, plummeting by 20 taels to 732 taels, before hovering around 40 taels. The total fluctuation for the week was 23 taels and 2 mace, with a net increase of only 2.5 taels. As the British and American silver markets remained unchanged, the Shanghai exchange rate also did not experience any special gains or losses. Some gold businesses made net purchases of British gold, while the Dalian group sold Dalian drafts, all in hedging transactions. Market transactions varied. The Dalian group remained long, while the Guangdong group remained on the sidelines, without any activity. Speculators' transactions differed greatly. The daily exchange rate was around 40-50 taels. The spot market was sluggish, leading to a decline in prices. Current inventories are quite high. The future of the gold market is likely to undergo another drastic change, depending on the stability of Germany's finances. The following is a summary of the week's developments:</p>
<p>▲Daily Fluctuations: From Monday (July 20), the large-scale exchange rate rose by 1.25, and the silver price also rose by 1.25, but the prior order remained unchanged. The domestic market seemed loose. The initial opening of the September gold market fell by 4 taels to 743 taels, followed by 2.5 taels. Subsequently, buying increased, pushing it up to 48 taels and 4 mace. However, sellers were also active, causing it to fall to 43 taels. It then recovered, with unstable fluctuations. It retreated from 47 taels to 44-45 taels. In the afternoon, large players unloaded, and the market closed at 43 taels and 3 mace, a further decrease of 3 taels and 7 mace from the previous Saturday. Transaction volumes of various firms were not high, and the market situation was relatively stable. The next day, the large-scale exchange rate remained unchanged, the silver price rose by another 1.25, and the exchange market was stable. The gold market opened at 44 taels and 7 mace, an increase of 1 tael and 4 mace. Speculators bought at 47 taels, which increased to 49 taels at noon. The market closed at 7 taels and 6 mace, with the Dalian group selling. In the afternoon, it reached 3 taels and 2 mace and closed at 4 taels and 7 mace, a rebound of 1 tael and 4 mace compared to the previous day. The overall situation for the day remained unchanged, with a fluctuation of only 5 taels and 8 mace. On Wednesday, the large-scale silver exchange rate decreased by 1.25, and the silver price decreased slightly by 0.25, but the prior order remained the same. Businesses tried to sell gold for profits. The gold market opened at 51 taels and 5 mace, a rise of 6 taels and 8 mace, followed by 54 taels and 5 mace. There were more buyers than usual. Soon, a Mr. Wu sold, breaking through the 50-tael mark. At noon, it was 48 taels, 1 mace, and 2 cents. In the afternoon, it initially stabilized and then fell to 45 taels and 5 mace, before slightly improving to 7 taels and 5 mace. It closed at 6 taels and 2 mace, an increase of 1 mace and 5 cents compared to the previous day. There was a difference of 9 taels throughout the day. On Thursday, the large-scale exchange rate remained unchanged, the silver price decreased by 1.25, and the prior order remained unchanged. The domestic market suddenly loosened. Businesses bought and sold repeatedly. The gold market was closed in the morning due to mourning for the overseas Chinese, but trading continued in the black market, with prices ranging from 51.5 taels to 55 taels, and then back to 51 taels, with uneven transactions. In the afternoon, the formal market reopened as usual at 54 taels and 5 mace, followed by 5 taels and 2 cents. The reason for the rise was the independent decrease in silver prices, the fall in New York stocks, and the small decline in the Indian exchange rate, leading to a strong market sentiment. Moreover, sellers were active, and rumors arose, such as the assassination of Finance Minister Song and the rumor that Germany would mint silver coins to circulate in the market, requiring the purchase of silver blocks. This news caused panic, leading to a sharp drop in prices by more than 20 taels, plummeting to 32 taels. Businesses such as the large player Mr. Wu and a certain Japanese merchant tended to sell. Later, it recovered, with shorts taking advantage to buy in, reaching over 40 taels. The market closed at 39 taels and 5 mace, still down 6 taels and 7 mace. The difference in half a day was as much as 23 taels and 2 mace, making it difficult to predict. The next day, the large-scale exchange rate decreased by 0.0625, the silver price decreased slightly by 0.125, and the prior order was as usual. The domestic market was stable. The gold market opened at 44 taels and 5 mace, a rise of 5 taels. It then went from 47 taels and 5 mace to 35 taels and 1 mace, before rising again to 45 taels. This was due to the uncertainty, with large players entering and exiting the market, causing prices to fluctuate. The market closed at 40 taels at noon. The afternoon was stable, with fluctuations of only 2-3 taels. The market closed at 3 taels and 5 mace, an increase of 4 taels. The difference between the high and low prices was 12 taels and 4 mace. Most firms tended to sell. On Saturday, the large-scale silver exchange rate increased by 0.0625, the silver price also increased by 0.125, and the prior order remained unchanged. The domestic market was tight. The gold market continued to rise, opening at 44 taels and 5 mace, followed by 6 taels and 5 mace to 3 taels. At 10:30 AM, the news suddenly broke that India was selling silver, causing panic. Speculators such as Mr. Lu competed to buy, leading to a sharp rise of 6 taels to 50 taels. Sellers continued to sell, and the exchange rate remained stable, with banks willing to sell, pushing it further to 47 taels and 8 mace. The market closed at 49 taels and 5 mace, an increase of 6 taels. However, the black market closed at 46 taels due to unloading by Hengyu Fuchang and others. The difference in half a day was 7 taels. The high and low prices of the British, American, and Indian silver markets and exchange rates are listed below:</p>

The Mumbai spot price decreased by 6 Anna to 43 Rupees 06 Anna, and the forward price also decreased by 6 Anna to 42 Rupees 15 Anna. The market situation was weak, it was reported.</p>
<h3>Financial Market Atmosphere Desolate</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday. The financial market was quiet as usual, with no important news to report. The market price of foreign small coins was 7 cents, 2 points, 5 li, 2 hao, and a half in the morning market, and 7 cents, 2 points, 5 li, 3 hao, and 7 and a half in the afternoon market. The results were the same as the previous afternoon. Transactions were made. Exchange draft transfers were 620,000 in the morning market and 195,000 in the afternoon market.

<h3>Securities: Bond Market Quiet Last Week</h3>
<p>▲Trends Stagnant, with Slight Fluctuations Compared to the Previous Week</p>
<p>In the past week, the bond market in Shanghai was quiet. Spot transactions were increasingly rare, with only 24,900 yuan traded throughout the week. Among them, demobilization bonds accounted for 10,900 yuan, with the rest being extremely scarce. The futures market was also calm, with daily transactions quite slow. Except for the first day of the week, which reached over 19 million yuan, the remaining days were mostly around 14 million yuan. On Thursday, there was only one afternoon trading session, with only over 6 million yuan traded. The total transaction volume for the week was 81.98 million yuan, less than the previous week by 38.3 million yuan. Among them, 20-year customs bonds accounted for the most, at 28.59 million yuan. Other bonds included 20-year cigarette bonds at 13.79 million yuan, 19-year customs bonds at 10.53 million yuan, 19-year good deeds bonds at 9.73 million yuan, demobilization treasury bonds at 6.465 million yuan, 96 public bonds at 2.42 million yuan, consolidation 6% bonds at 1.36 million yuan, customs treasury bonds at 1.055 million yuan, and financial and 7-year bonds each at 5,000 yuan. In addition, unified tax treasury bonds were gradually traded at 100,500 yuan. Finally, spot transactions for Shanghai Bank shares, which were newly opened for auction, amounted to 20 shares.</p>
<p>Regarding the fluctuations in bond prices last week, the situation was very dull, as described below. The situation showed little improvement. The Guangdong issue remained unresolved, the northern Shi army revolted again, and the end of the anti-communist campaign was still pending. Market sentiment was weak, and large players were waiting and watching. Supply and demand were balanced, but bond prices felt somewhat stagnant, with slight daily fluctuations. On Monday, most bonds rose by 0.8-0.9 yuan to 1.7-1.8 yuan. On Tuesday, they fell back, with 9 customs bonds and 20 customs bonds each down by a small 0.8-0.9 yuan. On Wednesday, they turned firm, with 20 customs bonds improving by about 1 yuan and others also improving by about half a yuan. On Thursday, they returned to weakness, but only by a small number of corners. On Friday, the decline was stronger, with 19 good deeds bonds and 20 customs bonds down by 0.6-0.7 yuan to over 1 yuan. The weekend was also weak and stagnant. The trend was chaotic throughout. The results showed mixed gains and losses compared to the previous week, with the numbers being very small. Judging from the trend, it seems difficult to have large gains or losses before settlement. The stock exchange has decided to cancel the seller's provision of physical goods for the August term starting next week and instead collect a margin of 2,000 yuan. However, for the September futures that have not yet been auctioned, selling is still limited to providing physical goods. The high and low fluctuations of various bond prices last week are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Yarn Sales Very Active Last Week</h3>
<p>▲Fine Yarn Insufficient Supply</p>
<p>▲Yarn Auction Price Increased by Over Two Taels</p>
<p>The yarn market was exceptionally strong at the beginning of the past week. As the inspection of inferior goods became increasingly strict, native yarn became stronger. The price of 42-count fine yarn soared by more than 20 taels in one day due to a shortage of goods, which was insufficient to meet the demand. Various groups resumed purchasing to rush production, causing the daily line to jump suddenly. The prices of 16-count and 20-count native yarn gradually increased, and spot goods became increasingly scarce. As for the customers, in view of the heated atmosphere of the boycott, the masses purchased non-stop for the sake of preventing future troubles, so spot transactions became more and more enthusiastic. The market trend was up without falling, and the auction price of yarn also rose accordingly. The spot market was tight, and more and more buyers purchased, and before long overseas yarn and cotton conditions tended to fall, a war broke out in the north, and the market slightly fell again. As a result, prices for each month were over two taels higher than the previous week. The total transaction volume for the week was 226,250 packages, with the most purchases from the mainland, Guangdong, and Sichuan groups. Judging from the general trend, the yarn market is still in a stable situation, but the incessant rains and increasingly serious reports of floods in various places have generally made people nervous, anticipating that autumn sales will be greatly affected. The purchase amounts of each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Group Packages Group Packages Group Packages</p>
<p>Mainland 4,200 Hankou 400 Shantou 1,400</p>
<p>Guangdong 3,000 Yunnan 1,200 Northern Group 810</p>
<p>Qingdao 1,000 Ningbo 220 Sichuan 1,575</p>
<p>Changsha 260 Tianjin 200 Xiamen 220</p>
<p>Jiangxi 400 Miscellaneous Groups 400 Same Trade 4,000</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Rose by About One Taels Last Week</h3>
<p>▲Benefited by the Ink Rain</p>
<p>The cotton market was very quiet at the beginning of the week. Because overseas cotton market was weak and gold prices were also hovering, and local cotton factories had no need, transactions were completely cut off, so people were particularly uneasy, and the market was in a big downturn. Before long, it rained continuously. At the same time, cotton in Hubei and Shaanxi was damaged by floods, resulting in greater losses. The local market was stimulated by the replenishment of empty orders. Subsequently, the city was heavily rained, the floods in various places had become more intense, so the mainland groups came to Shanghai to purchase one after another, and the rising trend turned sharp. However, the Huoji group and the Shanghai group were throwing it all out consistently, while Indian and American cotton fell again, the oppression was still heavy, so the rising trend was still level. However, looking back to the floods in the country, the cotton production had been severely hit, and the future of the cotton market was unimaginable. The prices of cotton in each month were about one or two taels higher than the previous week, spot transactions were deserted, and the source was 2,210 bales of Yao cotton, and 557,500 dan of cotton had been transacted and graded by marks. American cotton fell by 40 pounds compared with the previous week. The number of bales purchased by manufacturers and firms are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Manufacturers Input Highest Price Lowest Price Transaction Volume Deadline</p>
<p>Huoji Cotton 38.00 丨丨 108 bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>

<p>Shaanxi Cotton 37.00 丨丨 100 pieces Again Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Yao Cotton 37.60 丨丨 1,100 packages Again Again</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Consistently Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to good weather, a weak Wall Street, pressure from merchants, and a soft market. Futures fell five to seven points, spot prices fell ten points. British cotton futures fell five points, spot prices fell seventeen points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell fifteen points. Indian cotton market conditions were stable, with Fair Gual falling 5.25 rupees, Oomra falling 2.5 rupees, and Broach falling 3.25 rupees. (Report from the 25th)</p>

<h3>Grain Market: Top White Rice Suddenly Rises by 50 Cents</h3>
<p>▲ Xinzha: Yesterday, supplies from the west road were hindered by wind and rain, and arrivals were even scarcer. Business on this street was not very brisk. Top-grade rice suddenly rose by 50 cents. High-grade and second-grade rice also rose by 30 cents. People were panicked. Due to continuous heavy rain, nearly a thousand shi of thin rice were stored, and prices also increased by 20-30 cents. The atmosphere for Lu Yang tip and Wharf tip was quite good for customers and merchants, and prices increased by 40-50 cents. There was continued outflow of silver dollars, and the market tightened.</p>
<p>▲ South City: Supplies from various districts were very scarce. Due to unfavorable weather conditions, there was little business between the city and countryside. It was also reported that floods occurred in various roads, causing prices to surge. Fresh thick japonica rice increased by 10-20 cents. However, average second-grade rice and thin rice arrivals were also scarce. Due to a shortage of goods arriving yesterday, Ningbo merchants and street vendors were quite anxious. Market prices also rose by 20 cents. However, around noon, there were only about four or five firms, and demand seemed to stabilize. Lu Yang tip rice was favored due to a surge in customer rice, and sales were brisk. The market followed closely. Due to the scarcity of silver dollar glutinous rice, prices also surged by 30 cents.</p>

<h3>Sailor's Spirit</h3>
<p>— Wang Bingqian</p>
<p>After the school bell rang, the four of us returned to the room one after another. Each of us seemed a little unhappy because the final exam was approaching for us who usually played from morning till night, and we still didn't understand the lessons.</p>
<p>"Alas, time flies so fast. The big exam is the day after tomorrow," Zhu sighed.</p>
<p>"It's all my fault. I made so much noise every day that you couldn't study," Xiu said, shedding tears.</p>
<p>"That unlucky beard, the textbook will cover more than sixty pages. And that old Li thing, we have to hand in the arithmetic practice book tomorrow," Shu said anxiously, because people who do a lot of arithmetic practice questions make six or seven notebooks, and those who do less have two or three notebooks, but she doesn't even have half a notebook.</p>
<p>"I'm going to do arithmetic," Shu said, taking a handful of books, as well as an ink bottle, eraser, and many other things to the reading room.</p>
<p>So Zhu sat at the table reading, Xiu was reciting English on the bed, and I was copying notes, which suddenly broke our room's record for studying hard.</p>
<p>"Hey, hey," Shu said, holding a newspaper in one hand and a large bag of peanuts in the other, excitedly jumping in, "Look, Carlton is doing 'Sailor's Spirit.' Let's go watch it, okay?"</p>
<p>"Seconded," I said, pressing the copy, "Who's in the mood to copy? Let's go quickly, it's 5:15. Zhu, Xiu, what about you?"</p>
<p>"Stop pretending," Shu threw Zhu's chemistry to the ground.</p>
<p>"I can't go," Xiu was indeed studying seriously.</p>
<p>"Today is our last day of leisure," I said, "After this, we'll be scattered everywhere. Where else will we have the opportunity to get together? Don't spoil people's fun."</p>
<p>"But how can we get out of the school gate? It would be terrible if Old Fox saw us," Zhu said.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, just sneak out one by one," Shu said, looking at me with a smile.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, but Zhu, don't dress up too seductively. It won't be fun if we get caught," I warned her.</p>
<p>"Humph, you're the one who attracts attention, with your two little braids,"</p>
<p>In five minutes, we had everything ready. We sneaked to the tram stop one by one. With great difficulty, we got on the tram.</p>
<p>"Look, look, Mr. Zhang," Xiu shouted. We all looked in the direction she was pointing. It was indeed Mr. Zhang sitting in the front third-class car, tilting his head and looking outside. The four of us lowered our heads. I was especially afraid of being seen with my two little braids. We hid in horror beside Shu, not daring to talk or laugh, just looking anxiously at our destination. We jumped off the car and walked quickly to Carlton.</p>
<p>"Ah, what if we meet the teachers in the movie theater? That would be terrible," I said timidly.</p>
<p>"We're already here, can't turn back," Shu said, "I think the teachers are all stingy. Who would be willing to spend one dollar for a ticket?" I nodded in agreement, so we all bought tickets and went in.</p>
<p>The inside was already crowded with many spectators. We chose to sit in the very back, talking and laughing freely.</p>
<p>"Not good, Mr. He, Mr. Zhao, Mr. Lai, over there, over there,"</p>
<p>Shu exclaimed.</p>
<p>We saw those three sitting in the sixth row right in front of us.</p>
<p>"What should we do?" I asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"Quick, lower your heads, don't let them see you," Xiu ordered.</p>
<p>"They're looking back," Shu was peeking at their movements.</p>
<p>Zhu held my cold hand tightly. I felt her trembling.</p>
<p>"It won't matter after the show starts," Xiu still had some ideas.</p>
<p>The whole place was dark. The Metro newsreel and the slapstick film were over. "Sailor's Spirit" was on the screen.</p>
<p>"We have to go out before the show ends, otherwise they will definitely see us," I suggested. They all agreed.</p>
<p>"Zhu, don't be afraid," Shu also realized that Zhu was terribly scared.</p>
<p>"What—what will happen if—if they see—see us," Zhu sobbed.</p>
<p>"Let's just go now," Xiu knew that we were in no mood to watch the show anymore.</p>
<p>Before 6 o'clock, we rushed back to school.</p>
<p>What a regret. We spent four dollars, didn't watch the show, and ended up with a scare. We were extremely upset.</p>
<h3>Before and After Graduation</h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Xian was a "Bachelor" graduating from the Department of Political Science of the Faculty of Law this year. Before graduation, everyone called him County Magistrate, — some even jokingly called him the County Magistrate of Haimen County — because Xian was big and looked majestic, with an appearance (?) that really resembled a county magistrate. Xian himself was happy to accept this "County Magistrate" title, and he seemed to have no intention of taking any job other than County Magistrate after graduation.</p>
<p>It has been more than a month and a half since graduation, and Xian has sent express letters and registered letters to relatives and friends... so far, there is no certainty. Not to mention County Magistrate, even a clerical worker in a government office or a teacher in a primary or secondary school, earning forty or fifty yuan a month, is still unattainable, making the big guy restless.</p>
<p>Xian's only hope is to beg the head of the Department of Political Science to find a position in the Municipal Education Bureau. Xian said to his department head, "No matter what I do, it's fine,..." but he still often says to others, "Within ten years, I will eventually become a county magistrate. The fortune teller said that I will have official luck within two years, at twenty-seven and twenty-eight years old..."</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Mo was a "Bachelor" graduating from the Faculty of Education this year. He was very active in school, served as the chairman of the student council, and was quite close to the vice-president... He often told people that his only way out after graduation depended on the vice-president's recommendation.</p>
<p>It has been more than a month and a half since graduation, and there is still no news about a position for the fall. During summer school, the vice-president also came to the school to work. Mo was afraid that it would be inconvenient to talk to the vice-president at school, so he simply went to his house.</p>
<p>He was afraid that he wouldn't be home during the day, so he would go at night. He would go at nine o'clock at night.</p>
<p>Mo went to the vice-president's house at nine o'clock the night before.</p>
<p>"Sir," Mo had just uttered "Sir," and before he could finish his sentence, a voice said "He's gone." The tone of voice seemed to contain an insulting meaning.</p>
<p>Mo looked in from outside the door. It was clear that the vice-president was inside, but as soon as he heard someone asking for him, he quickly turned around and went upstairs. In an instant, Mo had seen everything clearly.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Chun was a "Bachelor" graduating from the Faculty of Science this year. When he was about to graduate, he begged his advisor to find him a job. One day, he ran into his advisor.</p>
<p>"Sir, please find... because I..." Chun said tremblingly, unable to speak the words.</p>
<p>"Okay,..." the advisor agreed readily. Chun's joy was indescribable. Everything depended on the advisor.</p>
<p>One evening, Chun went to his advisor's house again to see the advisor, inquire about good news, and beg for everything.</p>
<p>"There may be a position in the rural normal school, I will pay attention," because the advisor also served as the director of the rural normal school.</p>
<p>Chun was happy, danced with joy, and took his leave.</p>
<p>The advisor resigned as the head of a certain department at this university and as the director of the rural normal school, and went to Nanjing Central Political School to teach, no longer in Shanghai. This news was already confirmed, but Chun has not yet received the advisor's good news.</p>

<h3>Life of Career Women in New York (8)</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>The following is the daily life of a woman who earns twenty to twenty-five dollars a week, Clarae Williams.</p>
<p>Her original name was Clara, which should be acknowledged. Many of the girls she knew had lovely and resonant names, so later she felt that it was more appropriate to use the name Clarae.</p>
<p>Clarae works as a cigar sales clerk in a large New York hotel. If she doesn't make any advances each month, she will have twenty-five dollars in her pay envelope at the end of the week. She works very late every day, so this drama of life always opens around ten o'clock in the morning. Clarae and a girl of her equal status live together. These women feel that living on Eighty Street West is still very good. Their rooms all have running water facilities.</p>
<p>Clarae's family lives in New Jersey, but she left home and went out several years ago. She feels ashamed of her family, although she still has some love for them. Her mother is too old-fashioned, and her father smokes a pipe all day long and doesn't care about anything else, especially about his nitpicking daughters. Clarae's first position was in a candy store outside Jersey City. She felt very satisfied, and the living environment was also acceptable. Later, she met a traveling salesman who told her that she was beautiful and could work as a salesgirl in a New York hotel, where they needed attractive women to fill this position in the lobby. At first, Clarae was not eager to realize this proposal. She had only been to the lobby of a large New York hotel once or twice in her life. She had a fear in her heart, afraid that someone would ask her what she was doing there. But this traveling salesman who made the proposal came to the city every week and always reiterated his previous proposal. Clarae asked him which hotel he was recommending, and he wrote her a list of hotels. It had also been several weeks since she decided to go to New York. One afternoon, she decided to leave and left her name at several hotels. One of them was hiring, but they wanted to meet other women first and then give her a reply. Clarae or Clara, as she was called at the time, was very surprised when she received a letter telling her to go to work on Monday. Her parents did not approve of this move very much. Clara was willing to continue living at home and going to New York to work every day. What pleased her parents was that her weekly salary had increased from twelve to eighteen dollars.</p>
<p>In three years, her salary increased to twenty-five dollars a week, and her job was still the same as before. She had left home, which surprised her parents greatly. Now she has become an old New Yorker.</p>
<p>On this particular morning, she lingered in bed and refused to get up immediately, but she had to be at the hotel by twelve o'clock, and she still had to wash a few shirts and socks. She also had to find her own breakfast, so she had to get up and light the "Sterno" to boil water and coffee. The coffee she used could be eaten after a little boiling. A can of milk, a piece of bread, a few pieces of butter, and some crackers were leftovers from last night and were placed on the small table to have for breakfast. Her roommate had already gone out to work.</p>
<p>After breakfast and laundry, Clarae began to get dressed. She carefully combed and dressed. First, she cleaned her face with powder, and then successively used glossy cream, rouge, dry powder, lipstick, eyebrow pencil, and other cosmetics. Finally, she applied a thin layer of fine powder on her face. She had to carefully examine her face. "Her face is like peach blossoms and cheese," many people praised her. She not only worked hard to put on makeup, but also spent a lot of money to maintain her color and make it flawless.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly. Clarae hurriedly made her bed and tidied up the room at the same time, otherwise she knew her roommate would be angry. However, she didn't care much about her roommate's affairs. In short, she would tidy up if she wanted to, otherwise she would just let it be.</p>
<p>She wore a tight-fitting fake leather short jacket, which was her favorite outfit. The hat she wore was also very tight and small, with a feather decoration that dragged straight down to her cheek. The high-heeled slippers and extremely thin socks completed her entire visible outfit.</p>
<p>Clarae likes to take the Fifth Avenue bus to work. The fare is one coin and change, which she feels is also very worthwhile. Taking the bus is more decent than taking the subway. She likes to imagine herself sitting in a private sedan, speeding all the way.</p>
<p>The hotel where Clarae works has a wide variety and large number of customers. Wealthy people from outside the city often stay in this hotel because it is very convenient to get to the large stores and theaters. Large merchants also regard this hotel as their headquarters, and store buyers from various cities and towns also gather here, coming and going very busy. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Strange Letters Recently Found in Society</h3>
<p>— Ren Nongxuan</p>
<p>In the past two days, I have repeatedly received letters from my friend Mr. Jin Sheng Fan Ziying via mail. Upon reading them, I realized they were about a "Chain of Happiness," which was quite mysterious and deeply suspicious. According to the letter, within twenty-four hours, one must copy the letter nine times and forward it to various friends. It claims that doing so will bring the best fortune and happiness, and even a large fortune of 250 million yuan. Otherwise, an ominous omen will immediately follow. The claims are absurd and unbelievable, and I do not know where they originated. If true, friends in this city would need to spend nine cents on postage, and thirty-six cents for those in other cities, plus the cost of stationery, totaling at least four jiao (角, a unit of currency) of silver. One could say that the small fortune is lost before the large fortune arrives. I am publishing the original letter below to inform the readers of the newspaper, hoping to eliminate superstition.</p>
<p>Chain of Happiness</p>
<p>This chain can bring the best fortune and luck. It must be forwarded without interruption. If interrupted, misfortune will immediately follow. This chain was invented by a Colonel of the U.S. Army artillery during the European War. The intention was to wrap this chain around the Earth three times, which would have miraculous effects. Copy this chain nine times and send it to nine good friends you want to bring good luck to. Within nine days of sending, the sender will surely experience something extremely pleasant and satisfying. This has been tested and proven repeatedly. If someone receives this letter, they must forward it within twenty-four hours. For example, Mr. Weber followed the instructions and copied and sent the letter. On the ninth day after sending it, he won a prize of two million yuan. Mr. Li Te, however, did not pay attention to the chain and did not forward it, resulting in the collapse of his most magnificent house. There was also a Mrs. Hong in the Bai Si Qiao area who did not pay attention and did not forward or copy the letter, and her only son died within three days. Mr. Jia Shi Duan, on the other hand, believed in the chain and copied and forwarded it on time, and actually obtained a large fortune of 250 million yuan. Translated by 2.6132.</p>
<p>I, Ren Nongxuan, sent it to Huang Mingyi. Huang Mingyi sent it to Guan Zhuqing. Guan Zhuqing sent it to Xiang Juchuan. Xiang Juchuan sent it to Bai Ziliang. Bai Ziliang sent it to Lu Shaonan. Lu Shaonan sent it to Tang You Shi. Tang You Shi sent it to Di Yingxian. Di Yingxian sent it to Gao Zhong. Gao Zhong sent it to Hu Dieyun. Hu Dieyun sent it to Zhang Xiaolou. Zhang Xiaolou sent it to Jiang Zhuzhuang. Jiang Zhuzhuang sent it to Jin Songcen. Jin Songcen sent it to Yao Junxian. Yao Junxian sent it to Yan Jinsheng. Yan Jinsheng sent it to Ren Nongxuan. Please be sure to copy it nine times on time and send it to friends, that is essential.</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Planting Area and Harvest Volume</h3>
<p>41 million acres planted this year, with a harvest of 13 million bales expected.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as of the 1st of this month, the U.S. cotton planting area is 41,149,100 acres, a decrease of 9.95% compared to last year, close to the general prediction (a decrease of 11%). The planting area and actual harvest volume for the past five years are as follows (unit: thousands of acres, actual harvest volume in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>Planting Area Actual Harvest Volume</p>
<p>1931 41,491</p>
<p>1930 46,078 13,932</p>
<p>1929 47,067 14,825</p>
<p>1928 46,946 14,477</p>
<p>1927 41,905 12,956</p>
<p>1926 48,720 17,977</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to observations from some sources, due to the good cultivation conditions, the harvest volume this year is expected to reach 13 million bales.</p>
<h3>German Goods Make Great Strides in the Eastern Market Again</h3>
<p>Japan has a large trade deficit with Germany, and the market in China is also unstable in the future.</p>
<p>Tokyo News: The trade volume between Germany and Japan, according to the statistics of the recent five years, is as follows (unit: thousands of Japanese yen):</p>
<p>Japan's Exports to Germany Germany's Exports to Japan</p>
<p>1926 8,151 145,220</p>
<p>1927 10,612 131,390</p>
<p>1928 12,582 133,537</p>
<p>1929 13,446 157,273</p>
<p>1930 11,106 106,183</p>
<p>In addition, in the first five months of this year, Japan's total exports to Germany were worth 3,481,000 Japanese yen, and Germany's total exports to Japan were worth 39,813,000 Japanese yen. Japanese financial figures are quite worried about the increase in German goods imports. According to them, Germany has been selling its industrial products on the world market in recent years to alleviate its financial difficulties. As a result of the recent economic crisis, it is feared that its implementation of sales will become even more urgent. According to the above table, in the trade relationship between Japan and Germany, Japan is in a position of large trade deficit, losing a lot of money every year. German industrial products such as steel, rayon, and dyes have always been popular in China and other markets. After the European War, they were excluded by Japanese goods, but now the market for German goods is gradually recovering, and Japanese goods will inevitably decrease. Therefore, Japanese merchants are quite alarmed.</p>
<h3>Marshal Foch's European War Diary</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>At the Abbeville Conference on May 12, the Allied governments had already decided on the outline of transporting American troops to France in May and June.</p>
<p>The Allied governments again held a conference in Versailles on June 2, inviting Marquis Milner, Commander Pershing, and myself to propose a plan for transporting American troops in July. We then reached an agreement, acknowledging the prior transportation of infantry in June, and now advocating that July proceed according to the original plan. In July, 140,000 infantry and machine gun units must be sent to France.</p>
<p>The Supreme Military Council not only approved this agreement but also expressed its hope that the United States would supply 100 divisions of troops in August 1919, recruiting at least 300,000 people per month. In this way, the Allied powers could maintain their numerical superiority and achieve final victory.</p>
<p>Commander Pershing had a concrete expression of the Allied forces' appeal to the United States. On June 9, when the German 19th Army was advancing towards the Champagne region, the commander of the American Expeditionary Force came to Menin to see me, reiterating his meaning of March 28. He earnestly said to me that he was fully aligned with the Allied forces and that he eagerly wished for all of his troops to participate in the war. At the same time, he truly represented the unanimous public opinion of the United States. He said that the United States was determined to fully participate in the war, regardless of the cost.</p>
<p>This expression of public opinion was very beneficial to the military of the Allied governments. Unfortunately, material obstacles limited American cooperation. Unfortunately, these obstacles were very significant. On June 14, I submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister, stating the importance of this point.</p>
<p>In the memorandum, I discussed the basis on which the plan for transporting American troops to France in the second half of 1918 should be established. While hoping for a large number of American troops to come to France, I pointed out the various reasons that could hinder its realization, such as ships, horses, and military equipment, etc., because there must be "careful preliminary research in all departments, as well as coordination between governments, to establish definite numbers."</p>
<p>With the permission of the Prime Minister, I proceeded to conduct research with Mr. Tideau and drafted a plan based on the following examples:</p>
<p>If the Allied forces want to be in a secure winning position in 1919, they must occupy a numerical advantage of more than 220 or 240 divisions of German troops, that is, 80 divisions of American troops must be sent by July 1919.</p>
<p>In order for the American troops to have three months of training before boarding the ship, the last unit arriving in April 1919 must be composed of soldiers recruited in December 1918. Each division must have 41,000 people. Therefore, at least 300,000 people must be recruited in the six months of the second half of 1918 and the four months of the first half of 1919.</p>
<p>This plan was approved by Commander Pershing at the Chemin Conference on June 23, submitted to the Versailles Supreme Military Council for approval on July 2, and then forwarded to President Wilson, who immediately replied that there could be 100 divisions of American troops by July 1, 1919, and if necessary, he would order other troops to be mobilized.</p>
<p>Ships were the main difficulty. First, because of the efforts of the American merchant ships (Note: By the end of the war, the American army used 3.8 million tons of ships, but only 94,000 tons when the American army began to participate in the war.), and second, because of the help of the British naval commander, this problem was gradually resolved.</p>
<p>Only the continuous increase of American troops (Note: By mid-June 1918, the American troops in the two places of the United States and Jiang had increased to 42 divisions, totaling 1,747,000 people.), Commander Pershing was even more eager to form independent troops. On July 10, he came to see me, requesting that the American troops in the French defense zone be formed into an independent army corps, and requesting the supply of artillery units, and if necessary, they would be transferred from the French army.</p>
<p>This time, I earnestly pleaded with Commander Pershing, saying that no one was more eager than I to form an independent American army corps, so that the American army could fight alone. I am doing my best for this matter. I firmly believe that soldiers of any country will only fight to the death under their own leaders and under their own flags, because this is related to the honor and disgrace of the nation itself. Unfortunately, the lack of artillery made the supply of American artillery units a problem, otherwise the independent American army corps could be formed.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Allied forces is to gain numerical superiority. If the French artillery units are withdrawn to make up for the shortage of the American army, it may not be beneficial to the Allied forces. On the contrary, if the American army has no artillery units, and if it is used in a quiet area to replace the French army, so that the French army can be transferred to help the war, it will be of great help.</p>
<p>The assistance of the American army is not limited to the Western Front.</p>
<p>On June 17, Commander Bliss came to Menin to see me for the matter of Marquis Milner requesting President Wilson to send 4,000 American troops to Murmansk and Arkhangelsk.</p>
<p>President Wilson was half cautious and half unwilling to reduce the number of American troops and transfer them to the French front, so he had no intention of accepting Marquis Milner's suggestion.</p>
<p>But six days later, I learned that the German army had withdrawn several divisions from the Russian border to France, so I also telegraphed President Wilson, saying that this fact could be regarded as "a powerful military basis for the Allied forces to urgently go to Siberia." On June 27, in the second telegram I sent to the American President, I re-emphasized this point and requested him to immediately order two regiments of American troops to be transferred to Siberia.</p>
<p>On July 2, this issue was raised when the Supreme Council met in Versailles, and the entire incident was studied by the leaders of the Allied governments.</p>
<p>In order to determine the organization and maintenance of each army under the Supreme Commander of the Allied forces, the authority of the Allied Marshal must be gradually expanded to reach the interior of the Allied countries and include the entire war zone. The format of the London Conference was thus expanded.</p>
<p>But while the battles were raging everywhere, the Western Front was still the decisive area. The Western Front, from the mouth of the Eisner River to the mouth of the Piave River, was vast and boundless, and all fell within its scope.</p>
<p>While the battle in France was important, the importance of the Italian theater could not be ignored, because the development of the battles on both sides of the Alps could cause repercussions to each other. The first step was that the Allied forces could not be frustrated in Italy, and the second step was to quickly give them the opportunity to win. The Abbeville Conference decided that I would be responsible for the military affairs of the Italian theater, and I took this as a guideline.</p>
<p>In mid-July 1918, the time when the two armies were evenly matched was approaching. If the enemy did not attack, the time for our army to launch a large-scale offensive would be ripe. If the enemy entered first, our army could take the opportunity to attack.</p>
<p>On July 9, I instructed Commander Petain that when the 10th Army took the offensive, it would launch another attack between the Marne River and Limay to boost its momentum. This offensive battle was commanded by Commander Peislair, with the French 5th Army attacking the eastern flank of the enemy.</p>
<p>On July 13, I informed the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army of the outline of this plan in a letter, at which time he was deploying the strength for the great battle.</p>
<p>The troops needed for the first battle—to contain the enemy's advance—were mostly on their way, and this force could still be increased. The second battle—the counterattack—in addition to its own benefits, could also become a very effective defense method. This battle required extremely rapid mobilization of all forces in order to be effective.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of July 14, I went to Commander Petain's headquarters again and immediately decided that the French army would counterattack the German attack in the Champagne area. The German attack seemed imminent.</p>
<p>The preparations for this counterattack had been studied for several weeks. It took almost four days for the teams transferred from the forward troops to gather and deploy. If these teams were withdrawn from the defense line, it would be very dangerous if they were attacked by the enemy at this time.</p>
<p>However, I still ordered the preparations to begin on July 14. On that day, because of the German attack in the Champagne area, there was a situation of imminent action, so I agreed with Commander Petain in Plorevin that the preparations for the counterattack would be completed on the 18th. The enemy's attack would be counterattacked immediately.</p>
<p>While our army was preparing, an unstable atmosphere arose at the meeting of the Supreme War Council held in Versailles on July 4. Late that day, as the afternoon meeting was about to end, Mr. Lloyd George proposed a motion in English, which was later recorded in the minutes of the meeting and accepted by Mr. Clemenceau in the name of the French government. The content of this motion was first to restore the Versailles Committee, and second to restore the right of the military representatives of this committee to supervise the Allied operations plan. As a result, the sole right of the Allied Commander-in-Chief to decide and plan everything and the freedom to implement it were completely canceled.</p>
<p>After this motion was translated into French, I learned its meaning. The seriousness of this motion did not seem to be noticed by the members of the council. So I went to Paris to see Mr. Clemenceau. I told him that I could not accept this motion and could not continue to command the Allied forces under the current situation. So we went back to Versailles together to find Mr. Lloyd George, who was preparing to have dinner with the representatives of the territory. We immediately began discussions with the British Prime Minister and re-drafted a draft, in which I retained the full power to decide on the operations plan and was only responsible to the heads of state. If the military representatives of each country wanted to make any suggestions regarding the command of the war, they had to obtain my consent in advance.</p>
<p>At this time, the enemy was preparing to proceed. On July 14, the French army launched an attack and captured 27 prisoners. Under interrogation, the prisoners confessed that the German army was preparing to attack on the night of the 14th and 15th, and that the shelling would begin ten minutes after midnight.</p>
<p>Our army's counterattack preparations and counterattack artillery fire began to move along the entire line of the Central Army before the German army opened fire. Our army took the initiative and bombarded with a large number of newly appearing cannons. The enemy was greatly shocked.</p>
<p>However, the enemy still carried out its original plan relentlessly. At the appointed hour, the enemy's artillery units opened fire. Between 4:15 AM and 5:30 AM, the German infantry launched an attack on our army along the entire 56-mile line between Teri and Messiqi. The only ones that did not move were the Limay salient. East of Limay, thanks to Commander Julayde's proper handling, the enemy was unable to advance. The enemy column was broken by our army's dense and accurate artillery fire and the sweeping of the machine guns scattered on the outpost line before it reached the main line of the French 4th Army. On that day, the German army made several hand-to-hand attacks to capture this defense line, but all failed.</p>
<p>West of Limay, our army was not very successful. On the front line of the 5th Army, the enemy advanced rapidly towards Ypone between the Marne River and the Ender River. The center of the 5th Army (the French 5th Regiment and the Italian 2nd Regiment) was repelled to the second line. At the same time, the enemy crossed the Marne River on both sides of Tourman, drove away the outposts on the south bank, and deployed a bridgehead line facing the Mary Combresey Saint Angnen line, which was defended by the left wing of the French 5th Army and the right wing of the 6th Army.</p>
<p>On the 15th, the reserves of each army and the divisions of the general reserve were almost all put into the fire line to meet the enemy. In the evening, Commander Petain had only one infantry division and one cavalry division left in the rear defense of the 4th Army, and only one division in the rear of the 5th Army.</p>
<p>In this way, although the German attack was stopped on the front line of our 4th Army, it had won a victory on the front line of the 5th Army and at the junction of the 5th and 6th Armies. Here, the enemy broke through our defense line and even crossed the Marne River in Tourman. This partial victory would become the prelude to the enemy taking advantage of the victory to shake the nearby defense line and prevent our army from implementing the counterattack plan. Our army still needed two days to prepare for the counterattack. Would the plan be changed as a result? This was the urgent question on July 15. Seeing that the enemy's strength was strong and its progress was rapid, our army had no room for hesitation.</p>
<p>The battlefield in the Champagne area was 25 miles long, and the enemy had failed. The German front line that crossed the Marne River in Tourman was 12 miles long. The two battlefields were 18 miles apart, separated by the important town of Limay and the neighboring town of Monteny, which were still held by our army. In the 24 hours that our army still needed to complete the counterattack preparations, the enemy could hardly hope to resolve the battle on the Marne River.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when our army was ready, it could launch a surprise attack from the Aisne River to the Marne River with a 25-mile long battle line, making the enemy's victory completely futile. The key to success or failure was that our army resolutely and resolutely based on the original plan and adhered to the preemptive strategy, and carried out a counterattack between the Aisne River and the Marne River. At the same time, it should be vigilant against dangers that could occur anytime and anywhere. This was the best policy for our army to fight.</p>
<p>I used all my energy to direct this military operation on the 15th.</p>
<p>Although the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army had the same belief as me, because he had closer contact with the actual battle, he was particularly concerned about the German advance towards Ypone on the south bank of the Marne River. He wanted to postpone the counterattack preparations in order to use the troops prepared for the counterattack to resist the current situation.</p>
<p>On my way to Mo Xi to meet with Commander-in-Chief Haig, I stopped at Commander Fuyue's headquarters in the Noa area and learned of this plan. I immediately notified the headquarters that this plan must be corrected and that the counterattack preparations must not be delayed.</p>
<p>But seeing the reasonable concerns of the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, I asked Commander-in-Chief Haig to send two British divisions to the French front. In this way, the British troops on the French front, together with the two divisions that had been opened up, totaled four divisions. Commander-in-Chief Haig agreed, and the British 13th and 34th Divisions set off for the French front.</p>
<p>The two British divisions, originally belonging to the British 12th Corps, were transferred to Commander Petain to reinforce the front line of the Central Army and temporarily take the defensive. These two divisions disembarked and stationed in the Coias River area, listening to my dispatch, either to reinforce the French 10th or 6th Army to take the offensive, or to help the French 3rd Army take the defensive.</p>
<p>In this way, the urgent need for defense was remedied, and the preparations for our army's counterattack could proceed unimpeded, and the strength deployed for the counterattack was also increased. (To be continued)</p>
