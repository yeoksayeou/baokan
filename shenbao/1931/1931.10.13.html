<p>日政界對國際干涉頗憂慮我國照會日本要求卽撤兵熙洽與日人訂立非法密約</p>
<h3>美國鼓勵國聨</h3>
<p>希望行政會善用權威當視會議結果定步驟　　　（華盛頓）美國務院今日發表致國際聨盟照會、聲明美國願爲理事會後盾、努力解决中日危局、并謂國際盟對於糾正中日行動使勿爽宿諾、亟宜猛進勿懈行使職權所有之壓力與權力、美國未忘凱洛格白里安非戰公約與九國公約爭執者應負之義務此次義務、在將近之將來、當可援用於中日間遼吉事件云云、（十一日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）美政府請國聨施加壓力、盡力解决滿洲事件、美國願爲後盾之電、已於今晨遞到國聨秘書處、電中並表示倘日内瓦不能解决、則美國準備援用凱洛格非戰公約、（十二日國民社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）現悉國務卿史汀生爲中國交涉事、曾於九日電致國聨秘書長德魯蒙其文曰、國聨行政會前已編列其所討論之結果、而揭示兩造所應遵行之塗徑就行政會而言、兩造固已受有若干拘束矣、今所急需者、無論如何行政會不可稍懈其監視、亦不可不用其身分中所有權威之力量、以調節中日兩國之行爲、美政府於由其外交代表單獨行動之際、願勉力以援助國聨之行動、並表明美政府甚注意此事、而不忘却兩造所担負對於巴黎公約及九國公約簽字國隨時應盡之義務、以此塗徑、吾人避免使國聨在其現所應採塗徑中稍有爲難之危險云、胡佛總統與國務卿史汀生今日愼重研究美國在滿洲視察員即哈爾濱美總領事韓森與東京美使署隨員薩立斯堡所發來之報告、但尚欲待國聨會議之結果、然後始决定其步驟、（十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（南京）外交界息、日軍在東省暴行、美國爲維持華府九國協定、對之極爲注意、除由駐華公使詹森來京與我外部有所接洽外、並派該國駐法公使赴日内瓦列席十三日國聨理事會、願力助國聨解决中日事件、並表示此次國聨如再不能制止日本行動、美國即出而專作嚴重表示、保持華府協定、維護世界和平、（十二日電）</p>
<h3>施肇基向國聨要求派員調查</h3>
<p>英德報告送達秘書處各國代表紛抵日内瓦</p>
<p>（日内瓦中）國以國聨理事會重開在即、今日已提出正式要求、送達秘書處請理事會派遣國際委員會赴遼吉調查、現中國總代表施肇基、業將九日日飛機轟擊錦州及其重大損害情形、報告理事會、并請各理事在星期二開會以前、向其駐遼領事及外交代表獲得詳細報告、又德外部報告理事會、謂接瀋陽德總領事電稱、日本在滿兵數、未見變更、即偶然集中於營房内、亦派憲兵相代、日本在中國境内之實力、並未减少、現逐日派兵入中國領士、攻擊解除武裝之華軍或士匪、日本軍用飛機常赴各處偵諜、並擲炸彈、但據日人言、係在被華人攻擊時抛擲云、日内瓦對此電、極爲注意、（十二日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）外交界息、國聨理事會十三會議、我國代表施肇基將有緊急動議提案、申明在國聨會九月三十之决議、中國政府絶對遵守對日軍在東省及中國南部擴大軍事行動、亦請國聨注意、（十二日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）外交部電施肇基請將日軍轟炸錦州、及日艦來華示威情形、向十三日國聨理事會詳盡宣布並云、中政府深以此事國聨威信所關、人道正義所在、自始即誠意主張和平、今東省形勢益陷嚴重複雜、日軍不惟不撤、其暴行且較前更甚應據理向國聨報告云、（十二日專電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英政府今日將十月九日北平所發關於轟擊錦州事之官塲報告、送交國聨秘書處、該報告書略謂天津英總領事得悉錦州交通大會校會舍、現爲遼寗臨時政府辦公處、、於十月八日午後一時半爲日飛機十二　抛擲炸彈三四十枚、又謂北寗鐵路某外人工程師呈報錦州機車塲被擊中、死五人傷十五人、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聨理事會考慮滿洲時局之特别會議、或者今夜即將非正式開始、現英外相李定已偕薛西爾於午間抵此、理事會議長西外長勒樂下午可到、法外長白里安與意外相格蘭第晚間可到、無論如何、此五人今夜即將會晤一次、非正式交換意見、料美國列席旁聽專員駐德大使韋爾遜或將參加、目下此間空氣緊張、達於極巔、謡諑繁興、揣議紛紜、對於中國要求派遣國際調查委員會一節、國聨將若何應付、尤爲衆論焦點、因料日本將竭力反對、縱退出聨盟亦所不惜也、聞日方現正計議提對案、將滿洲作爲國聨委托統治地、委日本代管、但中代表方面以滿洲向爲中國整個領土之一部份、此計縱毒、勢難使日人如願以償云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法外長白里安已由巴黎啓程赴日内瓦、參與國聨行政會、討論中日爭端、按白氏前有渠須至遠東時局愈臻嚴重、必須親自出馬、始赴日内瓦之言、（十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今夕消息傳來、謂中國已有哀的美敦書送達日本、要求日軍即日撤回南滿鐵路區域以内此處得此消息後一時頗爲震動、意世界將從此陷入第二次之戰禍、未幾震恐之狀態雖稍殺、然滿洲事變日趨險惡、前途實至可慮也、國聨理事會雖將於星期二日召集會議、然能否調解此危局、希望實至渺茫、加以日本今日復有照會送致國聨秘書長德魯蒙、内稱、日本對於東省事件、絶不能容許國聨之干涉、其理由爲國聨對彼尚未可謂爲已十分了解云云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>日政府答覆國我首次通牒</h3>
<p>撤兵須有條件希望直接交涉</p>
<p>（東京）日本政府於九日回答中國關於滿洲撤兵之第一次通牒、其内容於十二日由外務省發表如左、</p>
<p>十月五日來函已聆悉、察來函前段云、日本代表曾在國際聨盟正式聲明、現在占據各地之所有日本軍隊、將從速撤退、恢復九月十八日以前之原狀、理事會最終决議、亦聲稱在十月十四日再開會議以前、日本軍當撤退、夫日軍之撤退至附屬地内、須以南滿鐵路之安全及滿洲日僑生命財産確保安定爲前提、乃在聨盟中之日本代表所屢次聲明者、又九月三十日理事會决議中並未說及十月十四日再開理事會議以前須將日軍撤退、關於來函後段所述之事項、日本政府所見如左、祈鑒察、</p>
<p>現在中國軍隊集結於日軍所佔據之各地方、使日本軍感受脅威、與事件初發生時一樣、標榜不抵抗主義之中國軍隊到處與日軍抵抗、使日軍有多數死傷者、目下之急務、在謀緩和國民之感情、因此有先將根本大綱協定之必要、此更爲先决問題、故日本甚望與中國代表面談、（十二日日聨社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聨秘書長因日政府之請求、已發表日政府十月九日答覆中政府五日照會之文、略謂在滿日軍之退入鐵路區域、須以鐵路及在滿日僑之安全爲條件、兩國目前要着、在鎭靜兩國輿情、然後日軍方可退入鐵路區域、而日本亦可準備立即與中國開始談判、日軍沿南滿鐵路行動、目的在以預防的行爲清除人數較衆的中國軍隊、或將發生之危害云、（十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日代表將答復中國要求立即撤退日兵文、轉達理事會、内容大旨稱、（一）國聨理事會九月三十日决議、並未規定日兵必須十月十四日以前完全撤回滿鐵附屬地、（二）自九月十八日以來、所有日軍在滿行動、純係一種預防手段、因有大隊華兵集合附近、有威脅之勢所致、（三）此項華兵常在鄰近易於發生不幸事件、（四）中日雙方人民感情之激昂、局勢之緊張、大有引起衝突危險、（五）日本認唯有直接交涉、爲安全解决辦法、將來可以容許日軍撤退而無衝突之危、日本自下準備與中國任何負責代表談判云云、（十一日國民社電）</p>
<h3>我方要求日本立卽撤兵</h3>
<p>我國二次對日通牒日外務省表示扺絶</p>
<p>（東京）日人方面稱、南京要求南滿鐵路區域外日軍於一星期内撤回之最近照會、與十月五日第一次照會、同一意義、日政府覆第一次照會之文、已於九日送交東京中使署、但因覆文中有若干點稍欠明晰、故中使署未即將日本覆文轉致南京、中政府因未接覆文、乃發出第二次照會、重伸前次要求、不過措詞稍嚴耳、聞日本於答覆第二次照會時、將僅僅請中政府查照九日覆文、因第一次覆文已聲明、在中國當道未表明於日軍撤退後能擔保滿洲日僑安全時、日本斷難撤回南滿鐵路區域外之日軍也、今日午後外務省發言人、一再伸說日本反對第三者干涉、並反對國聨派員調查滿洲情形之理由、並謂中國强令國聨干涉之謀、不能便利交涉之解决、反使解决爲難、因外來</p>

<p>壓力徒使日人憤懣、而破壞日政府不使嚴重事態擴大之努力耳云（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本外務省今日對於中國要求日軍立即撤回南滿路線以内之公文、拒絶接受、同時外相幣原知照中國蔣公使稱日政府關於日軍駐紮滿洲事項已將其所聲言者通知南京及日内瓦雙方云、（十二日國民電）</p>

<p>（南京）茲從某方探得駁復日節略文要點、一·指出日本軍隊此次突然侵佔我遼吉各地、爲蔑視國際公法、及違反數聨規約非戰公約及九國協約之舉動、日軍侵入時、甚至有爲戰時國際公法所不許舉動、二·中國以中日兩國均爲上述條約簽字國、在國際義務上應設法以和平方法解决紛爭故提交國聨處理、國聨旋即决定、令日本撤兵、日本並已向國聨表示願接受請求、三·中國政府自事變最初發生、即未採任何敵對有爲同時竭力節制全國人民之憤慨、使不逾越法軌、在中國行政權所及之廣大區域内、迄無意外事故發生、中國向國聨行政院所提出之保證、實已執行周到、四·選擇購買物品爲個人之自由、任何政府、無法干涉或禁止、中國人民厭棄日本商品之心理、乃萬寳山事件以來、日政府接續的不友誼之行爲所激成、五·在中國竭力防止事態擴大之際、日軍不獨未實行撤兵、且仍繼續侵略、甚至以飛機轟炸遼寗臨時省府所在地之錦縣及其他各地、並派遣多量軍艦來華、是最近十日内局勢之更爲嚴重、皆由日方所造成、六·日軍不斷侵略、中國已處極困難地位、但對日僑、仍竭力保護惟日本仍以兵力爲實行國策之工具、其因此而發生不幸結果、應悉由日本負其責任（十二日專電）</p>
<h3>日政界要人深恐國際干涉</h3>
<p>（東京）若槻鑒於國際聨盟及美國等對滿洲事變有擴大行動傾向本日午後三時歷訪山本伯爵·清浦伯爵·高橋是清等、報告政府之方針態度等、加以說明、請求諒解（十二日電通社電）</p>
<p>（東京）滿洲之事變今已漸呈國際的重大化之形勢、日本政府自不待言、餘如重臣樞府貴族院各方面、皆超越黨派、一致憂慮其結局若槻首相本日與幣原外相·安達内相會見後、又歷訪山本伯爵高橋是清氏清浦伯爵等、關於滿洲之事態、詳細說明、請求諒解（十二日日聨社電）　　（東京）清浦伯爵本日午前往訪牧野内府、談時局問題、歷二時之久、所談者爲對華問題財政局問題及政局不安說等、足見日本元老重臣方面、對於時局頗有憂慮之色（十二日日聨社電）</p>
<p>（東京）今日午後南陸相覲見日皇、奏報滿洲時局近今之變化（十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本後備隊俱樂部現已上書陸軍省爲政府張目送呈該俱樂部所通過之議案一通略謂日本海陸後備隊以爲第三者對於中日交涉之干涉應絶對拒絶、該會一致贊成滿洲軍事現狀必須維持之政策必如是方可使滿洲與遠東之和平爲秩序立於永遠基礎之上云、此議案除由該會會長鈴木將軍遞交陸相外並以副本送交參謀部長、該會自稱有會員三百萬人、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）據路透訪員得悉此間最高政界之情感、爲日政府對於中國希圖强迫國聨干涉滿洲爭端、殊爲不安、現信日政府準備與中國任何負責代表開直接談判、惟反對局外干涉之建議、日政府除恐第三者之干涉、將減弱其阻止事勢擴大之努力外、且覺日本從未圖要求新讓與權或特殊權利、僅欲要求尊重按照現約應有之權利與特殊權利耳、蓋此番解决、如藉第三者之助而成功、則中國將常以爲日本乃爲外勢所迫、不敢提出更苛之條件換言之、即日本預備提出較寛之條件、特不欲使人視爲日本之取温和態度、乃出於外界之壓逼耳、日本答覆國聨之公文、本定昨夜發出、但延至今日午後始發、聞文内仍謂（一）日本曾竭力阻止滿洲局勢之增重（二）日本主張向中日直接談判而不受第三者之干涉（三）現除派兵至鐵路區域外保護韓人與剿匪之可能的零星事件外、滿洲不致再有新發展（四）揚子江流域之時局增重、中國須負厥責、日本派艦至揚子江各口岸、純爲保護日僑之生命財産起見、（五）述明日軍未能即退至南滿鐵路區域内各地點之爲難情形、蓋首須保證中國力能担保治安與秩序之維持也（六）聲明日本確信中日之永遠合作、可使雙方互受其益、故目下急宜依據根本原則恢復平時之關係云云、今日首相若槻往見首相山本伯爵高橋及清浦三人、東京人士對此、大爲注意、且有種種猜測、其性質未悉、惟衆信或關係滿洲時局、或因内閣將起風潮之故、（十二日路透社電）</p>

<p>特依據此主旨、答覆理事會議長之通告、以資理事會最終會議之决議之參考、（二）今軍事行動雖已經告一段落、但時見有異狀之發展、例如爲援鮮人而派出之日軍赴錦州從事偵察之日軍飛機、被中國軍隊狙擊、因對抗之故而擲炸彈等事、若果諒解當時之情勢、自然當與首肯、若以如是反映的事實、遽認爲有使事態愈形擴大之性質之、則可謂不明眞相者矣、（十二日日聨社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日代表照命理事會稱、日本軍事當局因中國不能担任保護在滿日僑生命財産、不得不放棄撤兵决議、僅就設有足以維持秩序機關之地方撤回日軍、且因未駐日軍地方、日僑益覺不安全、以致回復滿洲原狀之舉、極爲困難云云、日代表又於星期杪報告國聨理事會稱、中國内地抗日之動加甚、揚子江沿岸日本領事業已撤退、其他地方日領事亦有數處已奉命準備離境、日僑在華居留地方、多準備退出云、（十一日國民社電）</p>
<h3>日政府將對美國聲明</h3>
<p>對軍事行動猶圖曲辯</p>
<p>（華盛頓）聞日本大使出淵、將於明日以日政府態度之聲明書、送達美政府、蓋日猶以爲外間誤會其在滿行動之動機、所傳軍事行動、亦不免言過其失、欲有所曲辯、說明其一切行爲、專爲保護日人生命財産起見、合乎情理之内、冀掩天下人耳目云、（十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>欲求停止排日日人必先反省</h3>
<p>某要人談覆牒内容</p>
<p>（南京）日本政府致中國國民政府之節略、已於十一日晨十時、由日本公使重光送達外交部、記者因此事特往謁某要人、詢我方態度、據云、此次中國國民之抗日運動、完全係因日本在東三省暴行所引起、日本無故佔據東三省土地、殺戮東三省人民、全國人士、激於義憤、起謀抵抗、組織抗日救國會、對日經濟絶交、促日方之反省、完全係國民愛國精神之表現、苟無軌外行動、政府實無法可以制止、且日本政府儘管違背國際公法華盛頓九國公約及非戰條約等、屢施暴行於我、而國民政府則始終鎭靜、尊重國聨决議、謀正當之解决、對於僑華日人之生命財産、盡量保護、自九月十八日事變發生以後、國民政府統治下之各地日僑、安全如故、從未遭任何損害、即爲國民政府保護周到與中國國民無軌外行動之明證、日本在華暴行山積、而中國人民猶能服從政府命令、謹守秩序、除和平抵抗外、絲毫無軌外行爲、此種忍耐性、世界各國、均爲感動、試以日人處我之地位、其舉動又將何如、外交部將根據此種理由駁覆、昨日雖係星期日、而特别外交行員會仍開會討論復牒、大約今日再開一次會議、即可將字句商酌妥當後、送達日外務省、某要人最後謂、日政府如希望中國人民停止抗日運動、則必首先反省、尊重國聨决議、立即撤退東三省軍隊、恢復九月十八日以前之狀態、現日政府不但無此種表示、且增派軍艦來華示威恫嚇、又以飛機轟擊錦州、殘殺軍民、希圖推翻遼寗臨時政府、中國人民抗日之動、自必更加激烈、因此而引起之糾紛、日政府不能不負其責也、（十二日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>國聨之最後關頭</h3>
<p>國聨以東北風雲之日趨嚴重。將於今日續開行政會。議商討最後之解决。德法英意西外交當局。以及美國駐瑞公使。都將列席。集全世界政治家外交家於一堂。討論處置迫害世界之嚴重禍機。凡屬誠意愛護和平愛護人類之人。當無不切盼其能排除萬難。使中日兩國目前之嚴重情態。獲得最後合乎公理的平允解决</p>
<p>然而綜合事實而觀察。吾人之希望。恐仍不能存多少樂觀。此問題之一方面。在於日人是否肯接受世界正義之勸告抑制其囊括東北雄覇東亞之野心。而另一方面。則在於國聨是否能終始基於正義之立塲上。本盟約作堅决有效之判斷。如其不能。則國聨本身固將爲日人巨靈之掌扼喉而夭折。而世界局面。更將立即陷入非常足以悲觀之慘境。故曰國聨今已步入最後關頭。而世界已走上和平與戰爭分歧之路口。</p>
<p>證諸日人最近之行動。吾人决無法保證日人有歛抑其故意迫害世界之暴行之誠意。上月三十日國聨閉會時。决議中日兩國須各自約束。日軍須全部撤出中國領土。恢復九月十八日以前之狀態。日代表芳澤固曾全部應承。然而截至今日。日軍旣並未撤退。抑且進襲我錦州暗使我東北宗社黨之運動獨立同時更派遣大批軍艦駛入我沿江各埠。百般威脅恫嚇。此種行動。任何人都可以理解其爲有意的掀起世界可怖之黑潮，有意的背棄國際信義。有意的扼國聨之喉而必置之死地惟有愚人始信日人。能於此次行政會議中。俯首受國聨之部勒。</p>
<p>中國自始迄終保持絶對鎭靜態度。中國人民迫於忍無可忍之暴行。感情雖達於日熱化。但終始並未有任何足以擴大事態之嚴重之準備與行爲。在國聨一日未表示對此問題撒手之前。中國固仍切盼國聨能使此問題獲得完滿之解决。仍切盼各國政府。能履行國聨盟約與非戰公約九國協約簽字之責任。以保障國際間無上之尊嚴。但設使不幸而國聨一旦表示撕手。使中國在國際上。在公理上都不能獲得一伸訴之機會。則事實將使中國對公理絶望。惟有起而自行防衞。其結果必至中日兩國。正式以兵戎相見。斯時遠東戰禍一起。世界商業皆受嚴重之打擊在此世界經濟凋敝之際。更加以致命之打擊。將使各國蒙受若何程度之影響。引起若何之糾紛。世界情勢將轉變至若何狀態。均非吾人此時所能逆料。總之當前之問題。不僅爲國日間之爭端。其危機隨時可以擴大。隨時可以使乾坤旋轉。使全世界捲入無可挽救之浩刧。</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>故國聨今已無疑的臨到最繁重之職務。陷入最艱難之窘境然而假使國聨果有維護和平與公理。維持本身生命挽救人類末刦之决心則固無所有於當前問題之繁重與艱難。而自有其應急有效之處置</p>
<p>國聨果有此决心否乎惟國聨本身乃能作答。吾人且屏息靜待且看國聨如何度過最後關頭。</p>

<h3>日兵强佔遼吉用意</h3>
<p>目的在找尋新對手</p>
<p>完成吉會新法兩路</p>
<p>濱江通訊、日人此次出兵東三省動員者數萬人、經費定數百萬元日金、其目的自非在意氣之爭、亦非在長久的佔據瀋陽長春鄭家屯洮南等地、不過借此以分化東三省政局、找尋新對手、以實行田中義一之所謂兩港兩路及破壞所謂中國方面之平行鐵路政策耳、</p>
<p>所謂兩港者遼寗之大連及朝鮮之清津是也、所謂兩路、即南滿路與吉會路是也、南滿路目下、固在飛躍發達中、且有安奉路及安東港以爲之輔弼、但孤軍深入、進退未能自如、且自吉海打通兩路築成之後營業上不免少有影響、故叧一路之吉會路、就日人觀之、實有急速完全之必要、該路完成之後、以火車可繞行吉遼及朝鮮成一大圓形借海運之聨絡、則清津與大連、均可與日本呵成一氣吉省南部西部及遼省東部、在其囊中矣、完成吉會路之希望、積之已久、所幸往者東省當局、知其危險之大、終未便其如願、但已往若干年間、西部之吉敦路、已經完成、東段之天圖鐵路、亦已通至天寳山、所差不過中間一小段一百公里間而已、日人此次軍至永吉、吉林在其監視下成立新政府、更東出兵敦化、强制自行建築、將來完工後、縱即退兵、其兩港兩路之計劃、實已完成矣、所謂間島之四縣、穩然在其囊中、目下敦化一地、日本兵之駐剳者、雖實無多、而延琿和清四縣之日本警察·駐在軍人·及在鄉軍人等之有整齊武裝者、有兩千餘人、均爲完成吉會路而設者也、</p>
<p>尤有進者、日人未出兵前盛倡之松花江時代至矣之論調、其實施亦以吉會路之完成爲發軔點、目下日人、一方旣在推進吉會築路之實行、一方則進行延吉經寗安（即寗古塔）至海林鐵路線之路徑、擬定該線途中須經過鏡泊湖畔·沿牡丹江·經寗古塔·至中東路東段之海林站、或竟向北延長至依蘭（即三姓）、此路若能築能、在政治及經濟均有莫大利益、旣足以截斷中東路東線出海參崴之路、平時可分其貨儎客運、（查東鐵東線一帶、年輸出農産物達五十萬噸、且其地尚多未開闢也、）有事之時可以拊海參崴之背、刺伯力之腹、如一九二○年出兵西伯利亞之失敗、當不可復見、此外可以開闢之利源甚多、茲約舉之如左</p>
<p>（甲）鏡泊湖之水力日人於兩三年前、已派人往該湖勘查、耗二三萬金之結果、證實該湖之水力、用以發電、可供東三省及朝鮮之用、即思有所染指、其後闞朝璽又往勘查、欲利用而未果目下闞氏正在瀋陽日人勢力下、爲治安會首領之一也、</p>
<p>（乙）牡丹江之水利查東三省宜種水稻之地、以牡丹江一帶爲最、其附近之螞蜒河流域亦然、目下朝鮮人之在該處耕種者一萬幾千人、若有鐵路可通延吉、則該地一帶居留中之五十萬朝鮮人、又將蟻聚蠅營、淪爲第二間島矣、</p>
<p>（丙）寗安一帶之煤穆稜煤爲東三省北部之巨擘、但穆稜煤亦不過煤産地之一部分耳、寗安依蘭一帶産苗尚多、苟能開闢可以遮斷穆稜煤向哈爾濱及呼海沿線之通路、</p>
<p>（丁）林業之利東省林業、目下聚於吉省、而萃於穆稜寗安海林一帶、所謂中日合辦之海林木材公司者、正在經營中、成績不劣、</p>
<p>是故日人之測量海林延吉間之路線、不遺餘力、大約將來或以吉林之地方政府、或所謂東北新政府者爲對手、以取得該路之建築權也、（按吉林臨時政府之成立、日本報紙多稱之爲獨立政府、其干涉我國内政之野心、灼然可見、吾人甚冀地方賢達、勿受其愚、勿作李完用第二也、）</p>
<p>以上係日人東進北進政策、且已見諸實行、或正在準備實行中、至於西進北進政策、又如何耶、述之如次、</p>
<p>日人口口聲聲以爲吉海瀋海兩路及打通路、爲南滿路之平行線路、故此次出兵即佔鄭家屯（通遼）及洮南、撞其樞紐、以謀進取、四洮路局長、且已由日人另行任命更以未得北寗路當局之許可、載兵數列車、向新民移動、即佔據該地、查瀋陽至新民間、日俄戰爭之時、日人即已築有軍用鐵路、即名新奉路、由北寗路局於一九零七年、向日本交涉取回、改敷軌道、其　金已於一九二七年以前償清、但日人仍窹寐不忘此一段鐵路、以爲太給中國人便宜、且打通鄭洮諸路通行後、南運貨物日增、有養成葫蘆港以與大連對抗之勢、故日人日謀破壞打通路之營業、思再築一鐵道、與之平行、而能給養南滿路者、即新法鐵路之舊案是也、所謂新法鐵路、即新民法庫間之鐵路是也、該路中國於一九零七年擬批給英國鮑林公司建築其預定計劃、爲北向以達齊齊哈爾、因是日本極力反對、謂若築該路、須以鐵嶺或昌圖爲終點、不能與南滿路平行、於是議卒不成、此次日人旣佔據鄭家屯、又佔新民、以斷打通與鄭洮路之聨絡、並擾北寗路之行車、即對於新法鐵路、有所希冀也、若新民法庫、或再由法庫展鄭家屯間之鐵路、在日人手中、或借日人之欵建築完成之時、則打通路等於廢物矣、若新民至瀋陽間之一段、復在日人手中則自瀋陽經新民鄭家屯洮南至昂昂溪之鐵路、均爲日人所支配、（目下四洮洮昂兩路有日人之債務關係）而所謂東蒙、亦在其囊中矣、南方再假遼河之便、取營口及溝帮子北寗路車不能出關、即中東路亦分爲三截、無用武地矣、</p>
<p>是故吉會新法兩路、實爲日本此次出兵之最大目的、（次之則爲商租權之確保等）吉會旣已强築新法亦在凱觎中、其進行方法、則舊對手不肯承諾而將求之於新對於也、</p>
<p>吉林政府、目下已在其監視下改組、而得一新對手矣、其餘據日報所載、亦正在進行中、且極力鼓吹獨立、爲今之計、應急由中央政府對中外宣言、凡九月十九日以後、東三省各公私團體或私人、凡與外人訌立契約一律無效、庶足以杜絶後患也、（十月五日）</p>
<h3>吉林日軍强築飛機塲</h3>

<p>北山城子地方、自無向吉垣進發之理、惟日軍近日恰在吉長車站方面及北新開門地方、連挖戰壕數道、日飛機又時來偵察、一方又在城内牛馬行大募華工、多數人民疑爲募集華兵、遂有吉垣將有戰事之謡、其實日方招集華工、乃爲修築飛機塲之用、緣日軍爲便利飛機升降起見、在蓮花泡北之一拉崗處、修築機塲、限五日完成、已自由佔用民田十餘方里、每日需用千餘人以上之工作、故極力招募華人充當苦力、日方旣在省垣修築機塲、則其有永久佔據之意、已顯然可見、</p>

<h3>各校抗日救國繼續前進</h3>
<p>光華大學學生化裝宣傳光華抗日會宣傳部工作異常努力、除隨時聘請名人如李石岑王造時何炳松等在校演講外、復派隊往滬寗杭路一帶宣傳、近又以滬上謡言　起、人心不安、實爲日人欲契壞我愛國運動之策、因之深恐我同胞中其毒計、故特於雙十節日派多隊宣講隊員在西門閘北一帶化裝演講、以期喚醒民衆、毋受倭奴威脅而軟化、</p>
<p>滬大讀書與救國並進上海滬江大學當此國難、凡屬青年學子、應人人有臥薪嘗膽精神、努力學業、充實力量、作長時間之奮鬥、並因近來外界謡傳甚多、深恐學生家長不免掛懐子弟、日昨劉校長曾致函同學家長、告慰解釋、言極懇切上海中學生赴鄉宣傳本埠南市省立上海中學、自組織抗日救國會以來、工作十分緊張、每日上午六時、全校師生均齊集操塲演習軍事訓練、宣傳工作、向在本埠未有間隔、聞本週内由宣傳部擬定、分班赴滬海道各縣、如金山奉賢川沙青浦嘉定各鄉村宣傳云、</p>

<h3>臨去秋波馬來亞足球隊大勝曁南</h3>
<p>丨三與零之比丨今晨離滬南旋</p>
<p>丨門劵充災賑丨搭救無數災民</p>
<p>馬來亞華僑足球隊昨日與曁南大學足球隊作游滬臨别賽於中華棒球場、馬來以强固之後衞線、銳利之前鋒、三比○全勝曁南、在滬三戰、計二勝一和、全隊定今晨九時乘俄羅斯皇后號奏凱南歸、馬來三次比賽、門劵皆充災賑、千萬災民、當在禱謝遥送也、</p>
<h3>馬來陣線</h3>
<p>李文傑</p>
<p>蔡文禮　關信德</p>
<p>秦連源　梁啟瑞（上）</p>
<p>林天燦　鄧約翰　許永源（下）</p>
<p>陳玉書　阮國英</p>
<p>陳裕吉　隊美安（上）</p>
<p>蔡乾安（下）</p>
<h3>曁南陣線</h3>
<p>陳鎭和（下）</p>
<p>梁樹棠　劉社侃（上）</p>
<p>馮運佑　羅海光</p>
<p>温鼎莊世鴻　戴麟經</p>
<p>江善敬　陳鎭和（上）</p>
<p>陳家球　楊保淼（下）</p>
<p>梅洪寳</p>
<h3>表演更佳</h3>
<p>二次馬來之表演、觀者嘖嘖稱讚、昨日之戰、更形完美、所謂軟弱之後衞線及守門員之美中不足、昨日亦一掃而光、林天燦之守門、安穩可取、曾接出不少之有力射門球、二衞亦嚴守不失、尤以右衞陳玉書爲甚、中衞線則密密監視戴陳二鋒、此亦曁南空手而歸之大因、五鋒連絡之熨貼、傳球之神通、無論矣、</p>
<h3>曁南不敵</h3>
<p>曁南不可謂不强、但守衞者處於機器式之快動作之馬來前鋒左攻右擊之下、應付頓見困難、時有呆態、守門温鼎祥爲曁南之新排列、不能謂差、但第一球之失、罪不可避、前鋒因馬來守衞之强固、活動力大失、下半時楊保淼替入、似嫌軟弱、二隊概觀、曁南較之確有不敵處也、</p>
<h3>上場開彩</h3>
<p>上塲不三分鐘、曁南即爲馬來破門而入、初馬來開球、羅海光劉祖侃得之、連翩自左進、衝門至前、一踢越木未中、馬來大舉反攻、曁南球門、成包圍形勢、球飛躍門前温鼎新見勢危殆、躍出一托、門遂大開、梁中鋒在後、正中一脚、打入門内</p>
<h3>反攻猛烈</h3>
<p>雙方球員活躍非凡、馬來關信德在曁南陣地、向中一鈎、美妙非常、馮運佑截之遠送、戴麟經反身一脚、還人馬來陣地、劉祖侃踢角球、梅洪寳在右接得、不曾打中、衆爲可惜、時曁南之攻甚烈、</p>
<h3>二次失守</h3>
<p>曁南旣攻而不入、馬來反而得勢、李文傑遠送一球至右、陳美安接住一挑、梁啟瑞跳起向門内頂去、温鼎新急急接得、向前踢出、彈於門前身上、幾於失守、形勢岌岌、再而陳美安又在右進、遠傳至左、李文傑斜飛中去、莊世鴻踢出、鄧約翰趕上一脚、關信德用力遠射、一舉中的、馬來二比○再勝、此後兩方來去、曁南奮勇還攻、每及門而止、不少之角球、亦一一歸於無效、上半時如此而終</p>
<h3>麟經三脚</h3>
<p>下半時陣線、各有變更、馬來轉居順風地勢、曁南開球、一下猛攻、總不得志、戴麟經乃於罰球線處、兩次提起千鈞之脚、遠射敵門、砰砰如鳴砲、一次爲林接得、一次差數寸向左出外、不勝可惜、其後又曾遠攻一次、亦差數寸、雖未中的、射法美妙有力、全塲稱賞、不愧中鋒顔色、俗云、雖不中亦不遠矣、</p>
<h3>匹馬斬關</h3>
<p>下半局已去其半、兩方未有建樹、時忽見馬來中鋒許永源、獨得一球、匹馬單身、奪關而入、莊世鴻阻之不及、江善敬已孤身遠在門之右方、及江趕來、許早一馬衝進球門矣、馬來第三次成功、</p>
<p>蔡之地位不在射門角内、故不作越位計也、全局即以此三比○告終、</p>
<h3>明年再見</h3>
<p>馬來全隊已定今晨乘俄羅斯皇后號南旋、其人雖去、其高妙已深印滬人之腦海矣、再見之期、當在明年五月之全運會、臨别之際、謹祝一帆風順、扶摇直上、百尺竿頭、更進一步、再見再見、</p>
<h3>三戰成績</h3>
<p>第一戰　馬來勝西捕　、五比四</p>
<p>第二戰　馬來和華聨　四比四</p>
<p>第三戰　馬來勝曁南、三比○</p>

<h3>痛心的話</h3>
<p>— 鵑</p>
<p>親愛的國人。暴日的欺侮我們。無所不用其極。我們打落牙齒望肚裏咽。竭力的忍耐。實在快要到無可忍耐的時候了。但我們目前旣没有具體的應付方法。那惟有腐心切齒的忍耐下去。而一方面我們全國四萬萬人。該人人記一筆賬。從甲午之戰記起。一直記到五九事件。濟南事件。萬寳山事件。以及最近的東省事件。除了這幾筆大賬以外。還有其他零零碎碎的小賬。也該一起登記起來。把我們的心底作賬簿。蘸了我們的熱血寫上去。且看他們横行到幾時。我們終於要投袂而起。用血與肉來和他們算清這筆賬。</p>
<p>不除庭艸齋夫談薈</p>
<h3>車夫老王</h3>
<p>今年春天我在崑山花園旁邊散步的時候，聽見一個宏亮聲音：「两毛！」</p>
<p>我走近一看·知道是一外國水手坐車·明明說的是兩毛錢，水手只給一毛，車夫不服，所以喊他補給。水手要走，車夫拉着他不放。水手回過頭來就給車夫一個耳光。别的車夫和走路的人都憤憤不平，同聲喊「打！」那車夫說：「許多人打一個，不算好漢，讓我一個子和他幹。」話才說了，一拳打去，水手倒在地下，爬起來回打車夫，没有打着，被車夫一腿，又踢倒在地。水手知力不敵，坐在地下。車夫說：「两毛」水手不得已，給了他一個雙角子，把單角子拿回，没精打彩的不知走到那裏去了。我問車夫姓名，他說呌「老王」我把個大拇指向他致敬說：「　不愧爲車夫大王。」老王！老王！我從日兵佔據瀋陽一直到如今是没有一天不思念您呀！</p>
<h3>羅陽邱力士</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>羅陽。爲寳山之首鎭。力士姓邱。佚其名。其里人也。幼時已有膽識。及壯身長大可九尺餘。且肥碩逈異恒流。故人咸以將軍稱之。邱亦自負。曰。一某非天驕。何敢承。但與世之峨大冠。執斗大之印。而不能捍衞地方。以維護我芸芸之民庶者。某特稍勝耳。」嘉靖間倭寇海隅。而羅陽當其衝。一日寇自馬橋長驅以入。刀光之下。男女數千。無一倖免。賊蹤所至衰草一碧。池河屍積。爲之不流。邱見未死者猶狂奔無所。緩即又膏其刃。即歸取其所持矛。倒拖以出。且怒且呼。曰「殺賊。殺賊。」其妻不知何以。曰「公又痴發耶。」邱不顧。疾走如飛。逕趨南塘高阜。横矛長嘯。時避賊者衆。聞其聲皆大呼救命。邱曰「爾等無恐。有我在。徐徐行可矣。」未幾。賊蜂擁至。砍人項骨。聲震里閈。而邱立下以一矛撓其勢。張口大喝。賊爲之辟易者數里。初自月滿至此。賊如入無人之境。遇邱。其鋒亦稍稍挫已。後賊復來。舞長刀以與邱鬥。矛洞其胸達背脊以仆。餘俱不能前邱有知友馬千觔者。亦勇夫也。聞警執殳來助邱。其氣益壯。相將直進。遇賊即搏殺之。賊後至者。大駭。乃聚而結陣來戰。邱心未餒。而力已稍倦。見此。頓足泣下。語千觔。「公且避。賊至。非我兩人所能當。我體重。不能行。我將與賊决死。同一死也。死足以謝羅民。公後日來收吾骨可也。」千觔亦泣不可仰。不肯逕離。邱太息曰。「走矣。稍緩。陪我死。其如無後盾何。」語甫竟。而賊已圍三匝。邱厲聲且駡且殺。并刺其渠魁。殺其黨首級十餘。不幸予忽折。賊因共乘之。砍邱足顆。遂不能立。坐地廢焉。踰　時爲賊支解。寸寸臠割而去。千觔來。大哭。掘土埋之。弔之曰。吾不走。當助一臂。吾負君。吾腸斷矣。吾心碎矣。」歸復經紀其家。然後已。噫。如力士者。不忍數千人之命</p>
<h3>反日聲中之之小常識</h3>
<p>— 瘦曼</p>
<p>近來國人反日宣言及通電中。多稱日人爲倭奴、矮奴。閱者多知其爲日人之别名。而不知其名稱之意義。余爰爲解釋如下。非以自炫。蓋此亦國人應有之認識也。</p>
<p>元時稱日本爲倭奴國。蓋其民族以大倭族爲主要。故今稱日人爲倭奴。</p>
<p>矮奴爲古之毛民其體多毛。處於日本之北海道。及庫頁島等地。故又稱日人爲矮奴。</p>
<p>唐時。道州之民多侏儒。長不滿三尺。謂之矮奴。今日本人之體。亦多短小。則矮奴之名。實含雙關之妙也　。</p>
<p>。死於賊之刀下。而願以一人作犧牲。雖千秋秋俎豆。馨香而膜拜之。亦復何愧。迺名字族系。迄無可攷。亦當日執筆者之失歟故補述之。</p>
<h3>林白來華聲中之妙文</h3>
<p>— 才良</p>
<p>此次美飛行家林白大佐來華。各報已詳載其事最近聞渠自願往我國各災地飛行視察。并攝影以爲他日歸國勸募賑欵之用。古道熱腸。殊深欽佩。敝友楊君。夙精翰墨。昨承見惠其近作。「祝林白氏飛行全球成功」一文。詞句典麗。斐然可誦。予以文頗足以增進中美邦交之親善。爰筆之如下。想亦爲讀者所樂聞歟。爰有物兮。矯若游龍。鳴機軋軋。過隙怱怱。上騰碧落。直偪蒼穹。閃影如電。奮翮生風。古里失跡。林白旌功。浮游九天上。周覽八紘中。窮宇宙於瞬息。聊顧盼而自雄。渺滄海之一粟。越高山之萬重。混中外而無阻。履險夷而皆同。巧奪奇肱巧。工超公輸工。小子不識。敢問於公。公曰此夫高而不危。妙機其微歟。竿頭日上。終與俗違歟。飄颻乎羽化登僊。潰紅塵而出圍歟。如鵬負冥。如鳥斯翬。仰羅星斗。俛察邦幾。夫是之謂林白之飛機。</p>
<h3>記歌場春色</h3>
<p>— 勝寒</p>
<p>喧傳已久之天。慕維通聲片「歌塲春色」。已於七日上午十時在光陸戲院試映。予於九時驅車往。至則座已將滿。入座約十分鐘。即行開映。該片係片上發音。聲音異常清晰。逈非蠟盤配音者可比。觀畢返寓。爰拉雜記之。</p>
<p>該片劇本。係由本報說部扶輪會姚蘇鳳所著之「女人女人」改編而成。劇中穿揷水災賑濟游藝會一幕。或以爲近乎枝節。詎不知全劇之關鍵。在小榮偕蕙芳游蘇。而蕙芳游蘇之動機。乃在游藝會休息時與女友談話中引起。聞該公司導演李君言。是幕本爲考而夫球塲。後該公司因鑒於宣傳賑濟水災之重要。乃更易爲游藝會云。</p>
<p>劇中歌唱。除宣景琳之「青春之樂」「江南好」「棟花風」外。有楊耐梅之「寒夜曲」。徐琴芳之「芳草美人曲」。吳素馨之「蘇三起解」。浦驚鴻之「舞伴之歌」。及紫羅蘭之「紫羅蘭舞」。妙舞清歌。昔之不能顯諸銀幕者。今則繪影繪聲。得以儘量表現矣。</p>
<p>浦驚鴻以歌舞皇后改入影界。雖初上鏡頭。而活潑伶俐。表演極佳。惜以燙髮不愼。被火酒灼傷。竟至殞命。苟天假以年。將來造詣。未可量也。</p>
<p>表演以飾歌女李蕙芳之宣景琳爲最佳。宣固善飾此流人物。是劇先喜後悲。演</p>
<h3>作第一個、愛國的母親（下）</h3>
<p>— 胡嫣紅</p>
<p>兒子。你的勇敢。給與了我無上的驕傲和喜悅。確實的。</p>
<p>我拿了你的信向那些作母親的宣示。我臉上縱流着熱涙。但這熱涙是驕傲的。是喜悅的。當然。也是悲痛的。</p>
<p>本來一個青年人。並不只是屬於父母或是家庭的。大部份是應該屬於社會。屬於國家。屬於全人類的。你該紀得。在日本强迫中國簽訂二十一條約的時候。你雖是剛六歲。我曾勗勉過你。並誥誡你。「你將來不可希望死在家中。死在床上。當死在戰場上。要死無葬身之地。爲了你的祖國」。現在。這機會到了。上前吧。爲了你的祖國。不然。國家何苦要懦弱的青年人。做母親的何苦要不忠愛的兒子。</p>
<p>你這舉動。不單是愛國。而且是爲了全人類的公義而戰。我希望你並和其他青人。挽救祖國的危難。並在强暴殘忍的日本人手中。奪回世界人類之所謂公義。</p>
<p>是的。兒子。我敬佩你。我願意作中國第一個愛國家甚於愛兒子的母親。我願意現在全中國的母親都這樣做。</p>
<p>中國不亡。公義得申。人類得和平。爲此三者。我爲國家向你致敬。並永遠的警勵你。</p>
<p>勇敢些。上前去。我爲你祈禱。</p>
<p>來恰到好處。餘如浦驚鴻·張振鐸·紫羅蘭·蕭正中·吳素馨·楊耐梅秦哈哈·章擁翠·等。亦均稱職。惟飾張小榮之陳一棠。及飾張母之某氏。稍嫌動作不自然。該片有兩大特點。一爲發音之準確清楚。雖舶來最傉佳聲片。亦不能專美於前。一爲女明星之大會串。片中電影明星歌舞明星共有十五人之多。歌塲春色。得此燦燦羣星。益增漫爛矣。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>敲夢的杵（一一）</h3>
<p>— 程瞻廬</p>
<p>陶遲的呼聲，引起了軍門夫人的注意·隔著簾兒和跪地的少年問答：</p>
<p>「你是什麽人？」</p>
<p>「秀才陶遲。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽呼救？」</p>
<p>「趕考遺才不收，貢院快要閉門；因此伏地哀求轉送學憲收錄入闈與試。」</p>
<p>「不用跪伏，你且起立。」</p>
<p>「是。」</p>
<p>在這「是」字聲中，唐夫人已瞧見這少年，是一個美秀而文的秀才，便收了他的呈詞，而命他在原處守候消息。唐夫人回去見了唐軍門，把呈紙交付軍門，而央求他代求學臺，快把這秀才補送入闈與試；唐軍門爲著夫人已接受了陶遲的呈詞不把這事辦到，便失却了夫的面子。於是，唐軍門趕快去見學臺，替陶生乞情；於是，學臺顧全提督軍門的面子，把陶生補送入場，頂門而進；於是，陶遲竟得考畢三塲，發展他高視闊步元神的本領；於是，正副兩考官對於陶遲的作品，引起他們十二分熱烈的激賞和讚歎；於是，年僅一十六歲人人稱他陶遲小秀才的，到了撤棘放榜以後人人稱他陶遲小解元。</p>
<p>二十世紀頭腦的陶遲坐上了十八世紀的轉椅子，他竟高中了乾隆某年某科的一榜解元！他吃子科舉的迷魂湯，甚麽都不知曉了！他只忙著拜老師，認同年，刋硃卷，以爲十六歲高中解元，這便是聖朝佳話，這便是世界上第一等人才！</p>
<p>「陶解元怎不來拜見我這女座師呢？若没有我接受他的呈詞，他會考中這頭名解元麽？快來呈遞門生帖子，拜見我這女座師。」這是唐軍門夫人派着馬弁傳諭陶遲的話。</p>

<p>國民社十二日倫敦電、大條又見回小、收盤價近期爲十七便士半、計跌零六二五、遠期爲十七便士六八七五、亦跌零六二五云、</p>
<h3>外匯明暗盤異趣</h3>
<p>昨日滙豐掛牌已放長一檔、蓋銀市迭漲兩天故也、惟歐市尚平、計英金長二五、爲一先令七便士半、美金長七五、計卅一元七五、餘均亦升香港則减五錢、計七十八兩、殆内盤適得其反、初即趨堅、嗣稍見萎、午刻復佳、下午尤挺、乃金市已衝出七百兩外、詎結果似挫、惟比諸封關前上週五、計英金尚縮三一二五、美金亦縮三一二五、誠外鬆内緊之異趨也、華商略有扒結、計英金成交十餘萬鎊孟買來電買進數萬鎊、由中日等行售出、而美金約做開二十餘萬元、出納不一、但均無大票成交、殆美金每元合銀三兩一錢四分九六、國外未有特殊消息云、</p>

<h3>厘拆猱升愈勁</h3>
<p>市塲概况昨日因銀行方面、以前二日封關三天、交易併於一日清理、手續上當然瑣繁、茲姑不論、惟厘價及銀拆奔騰甚速、漲風日見緊張、雖不遠上數日之緊急、而形勢觀察、就疾徐兩種意義剖辨之、覺得此次漲勢、不减疇昔也、蓋目今滬上現底已不如前之充裕、經不起努力羅掘、苟再從事搜刮、難免有恐慌之慮耳、</p>
<p>厘拆價格「洋厘」早市人心激昂、厘價較前日午市復高一厘有奇、爲七錢二分八厘、午市聲勢益健、爭購尤力、卒以供方衰殆、竟不滿於買方、而厘價突然漲起二厘强、居然超出三分關外、爲七錢三分○二毫半、開今年所僅見之新紀錄、「銀拆」早市三錢、午市三錢二分、較前日又高七分、劃頭加水亦有三錢以外、收盤則爲二錢八九分、銀行掛牌一錢二分、趨勢甚緊、</p>
<p>輔幣市情江南小洋、混沌依舊、早市爲六錢五分七厘、午市爲六錢五分八厘、較前日午市略高一厘、交易早市四千五百角、午市五千五百角、廣東小洋、亦仍率舊章、早市爲六錢五分五厘、早市爲六錢五分六厘二毫半、做出交易、早市二十六萬五千角、午市四萬角、銅元縮去二千文、爲三百七十六千文、</p>
<p>銀洋進出、「銀欵」昨日銀行開關、收解孔多、華商收解票欵三百二十餘萬、外商收解票欵四百四五十萬、特欵收解三百餘萬、各種貨匯稅雜諸欵收解九百五六十萬、押欵交易二百餘萬、進倉一百八十萬、錢莊銀公單收解五千四百餘萬、劃頭欵收解六百三四十萬、各路滙欵收解一百二十餘萬解現一百餘萬、一洋欵一匯劃票欵、早市做出二百二十九萬五千、午市做出一百三十五萬、鈔票早市十一萬五千、午市七萬、塲外鈔票、早市十萬○五千、午市十九萬五千、銀行交易、早市互市九十萬、午市八十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解二百八十餘萬、鈔票進出三百餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解九百二十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解二百七十餘萬拆借洋欵二百三十餘萬、客路去胃八十餘萬、小錢莊交易八十餘萬、</p>
<h3>銀緊中之長期欵消息</h3>
<p>連日銀根步緊、而金融界對十底之長期欵、循次到期、亟須歸束、當此銀緊之候、放欵之欲歸束、殊非旦夕間所能如願、結果將屬於照轉一途、至於押欵情形、除日貨外、其餘各種抵押品、頗能流通自如、故昨日取同贖銷售者、核計值銀根毫十萬、而照轉或新做者、亦不在少數、至於證劵抵押品、目下以價格變動甚驟、且較上月間之原值亦相差至鉅、遑論長期抵押者、故此項押欵、届期恐難望取贖、其他之不動産抵押品、亦略有更動轉移等手續、然總以現欵難籌、欲期回贖、殊難願望也、</p>
<h3>證劵公債稍形回漲</h3>
<p>編遣一九善漲一元七角</p>
<p>其他亦稍漲裁兵獨微跌</p>
<p>昨（十二日）華商證券交易所各債券市况、現貨雖有數種開出、成交稀少、期市亦較清閒、而十一月期貨祗統稅、鹽稅兩種開出、時局似見稍佳、市塲人心稍安、雖市上大户未見收進、而賣出交易已遠不如前、故各債券於晨初開出時即步步趨漲、次盤堅俏、如編遣·裁兵兩種最高曾漲三元、後市緩和、有數種以上午漲勢逼巨、復轉疲勢、但統稅·鹽稅·一九善等均尚堅定、結果比上星期尾如編遣·一九善十月各回漲一元七角、一九關亦漲一元一角、餘各好數角至七八角不等、獨裁兵十月微跌、鹽稅現貨比上星期回漲二元、市情頗屬良好云、計全日現貨交易共七千元、期貨上午五百五十萬、後市二百七十餘萬、合計八百廿一萬五千元、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市形勢複雜</h3>
<p>多空各有成見</p>
<p>棉紗市况、因間接直接關係之衆多、致人心各抱成見、步伐互異、以故形勢之變異、時時更改、此期貨市塲行情上落靡定之所有來也、目前依貨立塲言、近期實有基礎、但原棉行情低廉、而時局如是能否站住、仍須視大勢爲轉移也、</p>
<p>期紗上落不定十六支人鐘標準、開盤時因多頭之出籠、市氣甚弱、旋以金市利於買方而漲、午後則大致平穩云、各月期行情比較如下、　　後收比上日　一月　一六○二○　漲七○</p>

<h3>期棉漲起五六錢</h3>
<p>棉花市况近遠期漸有接近之勢、良以本月份盛傳陳陜西花、某某兩廠均有預備交出、而外棉傾向後、實際上本棉消貨、幾等於零、雖來源與産地出數兩稀、不足動買方購進之興趣也、美棉今日無市、但昨日一般預料、明日有上漲之可能性、故遠月買氣旺盛云、</p>
<p>標棉漲風頗熾漢口細绒標準因美棉有上漲之希望、老空頭抵補、及　帮購、市勢良好、結果大五六錢、各月期價如下、</p>

<h3>英國棉業週訊</h3>
<p>上週利物浦現貨市面、非常活動、期貨方面、隨銀價爲上落、惟孟却斯德消息良好、市况已呈活動之象、美棉政府報告發表後、數量雖增、此間未受影響、目下市勢堅昂、埃及棉缺乏購買、未見起色、</p>

<p>糧食　河下米市南緊北疲</p>
<p>南頭　昨日到頭有限、各帮銷塲甚殷、蘇常白破初頗平穩、旋得新閘漲訊、喊起二角　交易極佳、北㘮·平黎新貨、統提一角、綠店方暢進、恐防再提、而各買客以重腸將近、到貨必缺、南帮青角·松江·楓涇·窰種等貨、一致上升二角、而貨客不肯多售、良以被産地報緊之故、新洋蘆尖及菱白尖來貨凋零、存底均稀、趨勢帶硬、變陰元到銷二敵、無漲跌、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日西路來源不旺、市銷清淡、新粳項貨買客不動、故價低落三角光景、新洋杜尖漸覺枯微洋米西貢因身本關係、到源減少、而抵滬之後内地與轉口二帮、放價競買、盤面未見回小、昨日形勢忽變、隨更未而回定、早晚稻銷亦爽、價好近角、變陰二元刻下雖呈堅穩、然有向上之勢、眞眞特别已喊十五元關口、</p>
<h3>小絞期現均漲</h3>
<p>昨日小絞米因有天津烟台等北洋帮問訊、人心望好、貨主一律喊高二三角、後北帮未動、僅本街稍有購買、價乃上漲角許、期貨洋行喊高售價、人心轉好、統市祗有大成代捷成出三月份一千噸、其他均係零星回籠貨等、價乃比上週末跳漲五分左右、全日成交現小絞三百包、價十元零三角、期小絞十月份五兩零四分、三月份五兩二錢及五兩一錢半云、</p>
<h3>粉市又轉挺俏</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開市後、近遠各月份均居盤旋之局、但因洋麥報大、廠家收進、空頭抵空、北帮又有少數現粉去化、故人心與市面一致上升、午後略有一度盤旋、收市仍轉挺俏之局、收市價十月份大二分、十一月大一分七五、十二月一月各大一分半、二月大一分二五、三月分大一分半</p>
<h3>麥市初穩繼疲</h3>
<p>昨日麥市、上午各月份均漲三五分、人心望好、市面似有暫居穩局之象、因洋麥報漲四五角、洋行售價喊高、但某方新到洋麥、且又續定俄麥之說、行家即有本月份套出、市面立見變化、下午收市價、本月份乃小三分、下月份仍大一分、十二月小一分、一月小一分、二月三月均無出入、</p>
<h3>糖市荷赤湧開三千餘袋</h3>
<p>太古糖劃市堅銷</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、仍乏到來、公會市場劃盤、荷糖二十四號粗砂白新貨十一兩四錢至三錢半、二十號中砂白十兩九錢、交易殊寥、市形見平、綿荷白十二兩○五分、頗爲俏俐、後市扳十二兩一錢、買方尚多觀望、太古糖上擋貨缺更俏、B嘜十二兩三錢二分半、HM嘜十一兩七錢半、CW嘜十二兩二錢、新到未能即行出貨者DV嘜十二兩二錢HX嘜十十兩一錢、市氣堅穩、號盤成交殊靜、禎祥等兜售二十號中砂白價十兩○九錢、問津寥寥、華新號售出現貨荷赤三千餘袋價九兩一錢半、行方進胃尚殷、以故隨即開售、市形尚屬平穩云、</p>
<h3>五金運輸困難成交益鮮</h3>
<p>五金交易邇因華商船隻鮮少、而日船又停止裝貨、所以能運載之船舶、異常蕭條、各貨出口因此亦極擁擠、惟市塲成交之貨、益覺鮮少、美白鐵昨因貨少、問津者較好、而價格開至十九兩五錢、英白鐵到貨較多雖成交較好、但行情則無升騰之勢、計二十四號售十四兩、二十六號十五兩五錢、二十八號十六兩七錢半、薄貨則開十七兩五錢、英鋼板昨交奇減、價則二厘半開八兩五錢、半分六兩二錢半、七厘半五兩七錢半一</p>
<p>分五兩五錢、而交易祇有零星而已、法釘西·　鉛絲·新鐵絲·馬口鐵·黑鐵皮等、昨日除問津外、殊無大宗成交者云、</p>
<h3>絲茶紅綠茶一致趨跌</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊茶市、自暴日侵略東省以來、旅滬英印茶商、態度頓趨觀望、近數週珍眉一項、幾於完全停頓、茶市一落千丈、現下華茶商、堅持力亦較前鬆懈、路莊土莊綠茶及祁寗紅茶、均一致趨跌昨日高莊珍眉、售盤見低一二十兩、其餘貢熙針眉秀眉等貨、亦均見低三四兩至六七兩不等云、</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>最近的日本夢茵</h3>
<p>李宗武著</p>
<p>「···中日兩國的外交形勢、益形迫切緊張、惟因傳統關係、與外交惡感、國人類多漠視日本文化、遂致對新日本之眞象、亦不屑加以研究、一味漠視、實未爲當、且對此緊張的外交局面、對方情形、尤有深切了解的必要、知已知彼、百戰百勝、這是古人名言、所以我們對於新日本的進步、及其最近的政治、敎育、兵力、金融的一切實况、都不可不特别注意、···」</p>
<p>這是著者在本書第一章中「明治維新的日本」一段裏說的幾句話、時至今日、日本不顧公理、破壞和平、突出重兵、侵佔我東三省、慘殺我無數同胞、毁滅我東北一切政治文化交通機關、瞻念前途、亡國滅種之禍、殆已迫在眉尖、而我國民尚有夢夢然不知者、如此、除令我們傷心悲痛外、對於上面著者的話、尤不能不領受、而對日本一切、尤不能不特别的、特别的研究與注意、</p>
<p>在最近抗日救國聲中、大多數智識份子、多提倡到特别加緊研究日本、這雖是羊已經亡了、兎已經看見了、從事「補牢」「顧犬」的工作、誠未免令人覺其「晚、」然而到底是抗日救國的一件極緊要工作、以我國之大、人口之衆、假使人人能知道國家之貧弱、與夫日本之强盛、因而知有團結振興起來取長補短的必要、則雖目前受辱、疆土被人奪去、同胞被人殺戮、安知將來祖國不會有强盛復仇的機會嗎、</p>
<p>本着這個目的、記者願當此全國同胞悲憤仇恨、抵抗日本的當兒、把這本「最近的日本」介紹於本刋讀者、</p>
<p>本書共分九章、每章又分若干節、全書約十萬言、舉凡日本的歷史、地勢、政治組織、政黨活動、軍事、外交、文化、金融等情形、都有一個概括的叙述、雖則有些地方、記者頗覺其簡單、有些地方、又覺其繁複、然而是著者「一種誠意的介紹、不懂日本文的人、固然是一種讀物、就是懂日本文的人、也可以免去找尋參考書的累贅、」（見程序）却類乎近之、</p>
<p>茲煤明瞭起見、特分章介紹出來、第一章「日本史話、」分三節、古代的日本與中日交通、中國文化與日本幕府制度、明治維新後的日本、將日本民族所從來、日本建國之始、隋唐時中日交通的狀况、中國文化儒家道家思想的受日本人歡迎、以及日本政治上所謂幕府制席之形成之種種、使我們知道日本與我們中國的關係如何密切、古代的日本的文化如何低落、如何腐敗、然而因了明治維新、銳意吸收歐西文明、改良一切腐敗制度、至今僅短促六十年、一躍而爲世界一等强國、這一方面顯示了日本國民向上努力的精神之可欽佩、另一面也顯示弱小民族想發奮圖强、並不是一件怎樣不可能的事、只在於决心何如、由此、我們今日的抗日救國運動當知所效法矣、</p>
<p>第二章「地理與人口、」分二節、首節地理簡說、說明日本的地形是由本國、九州、四國三島而組成、此外合轄台灣、流球、舊德屬太平洋羣島、共計面積二十六萬餘英方里、僅當我國十餘分之一、其本部行政區則劃分爲一道、三府、四十三縣、次節人口調查、說明日本現有人口之數目爲八千三百四十餘萬、最近五年、人口增加、平均每年約七十五萬人、如此增多、誠不勝爲我們積弱不振的中國前途憂、田中所謂「使世界知東亞爲我國之東亞」的一日、怕不會到來、唉、······</p>
<p>第三章日本政治機關組織概况、分二節、首節日本國家機關的構成、有、甲、諮詢機關、即保奏内閣首領於天皇的元老、條陳政見於天皇的内大臣、天皇的最高顧問樞密院等都是、乙、行政機關、全國最高行政機關爲内閣、下設内務、財政、外務、海軍、陸軍、司法、文部、農林、商工、遞信、鐵道、拓殖、等十二部此外有審查法令的法制局、及其他顧問機關等、丙、帷幄上奏機關、包含參謀本部、海</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>軍軍令部、軍事參議院、元帥府、海陸軍大臣等五部、丁、立法機關、有貴族院、衆議院、此外還有議會以外的立法機關、如勅令、閣令、部令等、其效力與法律相等或且更大、戊、司法機關分裁判所、檢事局、處理一切民刑訴訟、第二節日本國家機關的背景、分甲、元老在政治上的力量、乙、財閥牽制政黨内閣的關係、頗簡明、</p>
<p>第四章日本的政黨、分七節冠言、立憲政友會、立憲民政黨、實業同志會、革新黨、明政會、無産政黨、每節又分若干分段、說明該政黨成立之經過、組織的變遷、以及其政策、都很扼要、日本治政、雖名義上是天皇爲中心、實際的政權、却在内閣掌握中的、而内閣的産生、係由議會中的多數派政黨所組織、所以日本的政治中心、可以說是政黨爲基礎、因之日本政黨内部之複雜關係、誠有非專書所能叙明、本章所論、不過是其大概、</p>
<p>第五章日本的軍備、分最近的陸軍實况、最近海軍實况日本的航空軍等三節、在此、著者告訴我們日本徵兵制度、編制的内容如何、及全國陸軍分配之數目、詳爲列表、誠明顯之至、日本原一島國、故其海軍較陸軍則更爲完備、其戰鬥艦之數目、與吃水之噸數、若與中國相比喔誠超出萬萬矣、母怪這蕞爾小國、敢如是之欺凌我也、至如航軍、現尚努力地發展中、</p>
<p>第六章日本的外交、首節小引、概說日本近數年、以蕞爾島國、居然一躍而爲世界第一等强國、得力於機會的外交之力不少、次節二十年來日本的對華政策叙述日本壓迫之經過、如二十一條、山東問題、五三慘劇、以及其他種種不平等條約的構成、横蠻無理、欺我已極、第三節日本對美外交之趨勢、第四節日英關係的新傾向、第五節日俄國交近况、說明日本最近與歐美列强之關係善用機會、以取得外交之勝利、誠有足爲我中國外交上所效法者多矣、</p>
<p>第七章日本的敎育、日本國土雖小、而敎育之發達、學校林立、學生衆多、却非我國所能望塵、本章叙述特多、幾佔全書三分之一、著者着重此敎育、於此可見、其中關於日本的敎育行政、學校敎育、社會敎育等都叙述到、誠足爲我們參考、　　第八章金融概况、對於日本經濟之變遷、金融機關如銀行之發達、絶幣之沿革、以及目前金融恐慌與生産限制、資本偏積的危機等、都有一個概略的叙述、</p>
<p>第九章日本對滿蒙的侵略政策、對於日本侵略滿蒙的經過、列舉歷年來許多喪國没地的條約、日本侵略滿蒙的實况、設鐵道、建軍港、壟斷各種實業、又日本最近進攻滿蒙的計劃等叙述甚爲簡要、我們讀後、眞爲我們的滿蒙丨丨不、爲我們中國前途憂、證之最近日本在東北之軍事行動、其動機蓋亦久矣、只我民衆當局夢夢然絲毫不預爲防備、不亦大可痛心嗎、</p>
<p>統觀全書、對最近的日本、無論在政治、經濟、文化各方面、都有一個概括的叙述、不可謂非難能可貴、而末章尤更作爲我們的借鏡、著者作此書是在十九年、其時日本人併吞滿蒙的計劃、即有、一、以武力併吞之、二、以滿蒙爲日本統治國、三、擁宣统煤皇帝、日本掌握實權、因此著者在結尾曾大呼、「中國人民如不起來反抗、滿蒙在最短期内要變爲朝鮮的、哀我中國、將從此一點一點的沉淪下去哩、同胞們、起來罷、起來自救罷、一</p>
<p>果眞、事隔一年後、日本併吞滿蒙的計劃已見諸實行、武力併吞東三省如今已廿天了、擁護宣統爲皇帝、組織中和國、扶助滿蒙獨立的聲已喧嚷塵土了、我同胞對之又將如何呢、同胞們、我們還是起來自救罷、研究日本、打倒日本、奪回東三省、同胞們、我們一刻不要忘記這三件事</p>

<h3>軍事訓練</h3>

<p>他很氣憤不過的從操塲上跑回房間、心着有一種說不堪說的難過、這時、剛好是五點半鐘、</p>
<p>一瞬間、「五分鐘的熱度」這們怪難聽的名詞、發現於他的腦子中、他於是想到軍事訓練上去、自己苦笑一下、（中國人總没有恒心的、」他說、</p>

<p>「日本兵佔駐我們的瀋陽了、唉、了不得了、」一些素來不大與報紙來往的同學們在那幾天也各手一份、嘴裏也能講述幾句關於日本兵的暴行、他們似乎一變而爲熱心的、熱血的青年、東跑西跑、逢着同學便摇頭嘆氣的總講到這件傷心事上去、</p>

<h3>America Encourages the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Hopes the Administrative Council Will Make Good Use of its Authority to Determine Steps Based on the Meeting's Outcome (Washington) The U.S. State Department today issued a note to the League of Nations, stating that the United States is willing to back the council in its efforts to resolve the Sino-Japanese crisis, and that the League of Nations should vigorously and relentlessly exercise all its pressure and power to correct Sino-Japanese actions and ensure that promises are not broken. The United States has not forgotten the obligations of those who dispute the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty. These obligations should be applied to the Liaoning-Jilin incident between China and Japan in the near future. (November 11th, National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The U.S. government's telegram requesting the League of Nations to exert pressure and do its best to resolve the Manchurian incident, with the United States willing to provide support, was delivered to the League of Nations Secretariat this morning. The telegram also stated that if Geneva cannot resolve the issue, the United States is prepared to invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact. (November 12th, National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is now known that Secretary of State Stimson, in his dealings with China, telegraphed League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond on the 9th, saying that the League of Nations Administrative Council had previously listed the results of its discussions and revealed the path that both parties should follow. As far as the Administrative Council is concerned, both parties are already subject to some constraints. What is urgently needed now is that the Administrative Council should not relax its supervision in any way, nor should it fail to use the power of authority inherent in its position to regulate the behavior of China and Japan. The U.S. government, while acting independently through its diplomatic representatives, is willing to do its best to assist the actions of the League of Nations and make it clear that the U.S. government is paying close attention to this matter and has not forgotten the obligations that both parties bear to the signatories of the Paris Convention and the Nine-Power Treaty at all times. In this way, we avoid the danger of making it slightly difficult for the League of Nations in the path it should be taking now. President Hoover and Secretary of State Stimson today carefully studied the reports from the U.S. inspectors in Manchuria, namely U.S. Consul General in Harbin, Hanson, and Salisbury, a member of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, but still want to wait for the outcome of the League of Nations meeting before deciding on their next steps. (November 11th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles report that the United States is paying close attention to the atrocities of the Japanese army in the Eastern Provinces in order to maintain the Washington Nine-Power Agreement. In addition to Minister Johnson stationed in China coming to Nanjing to discuss the matter with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the country has also sent its minister to France to Geneva to attend the League of Nations Council meeting on the 13th, willing to assist the League of Nations in resolving the Sino-Japanese incident, and stated that if the League of Nations is unable to stop Japanese actions again this time, the United States will step forward and make a serious statement to maintain the Washington Agreement and safeguard world peace. (November 12th, Electric Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Requests the League of Nations to Send Personnel to Investigate</h3>
<p>British and German Reports Sent to the Secretariat, Representatives from Various Countries Arrive in Geneva</p>
<p>(Geneva) As the League of Nations Council is about to reconvene, China has today submitted a formal request, delivered to the Secretariat, asking the Council to dispatch an international committee to Liaoning and Jilin for investigation. Currently, the Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji has reported to the Council on the bombing of Jinzhou by Japanese aircraft on the 9th and the extent of the damage, and requested all Council members to obtain detailed reports from their consuls and diplomatic representatives stationed in Liaoning before the meeting on Tuesday. Furthermore, the German Foreign Office reported to the Council that it had received a telegram from the German Consul General in Shenyang stating that the number of Japanese troops in Manchuria had not changed. Even when they were occasionally concentrated in the barracks, military police were dispatched to replace them. The strength of Japan in Chinese territory has not decreased. Troops are being sent into Chinese territory every day to attack disarmed Chinese troops or bandits. Japanese military aircraft often go to various places for reconnaissance and drop bombs, but according to the Japanese, they are dropped when attacked by the Chinese. Geneva is paying close attention to this telegram. (November 12th, Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles report that at the League of Nations Council meeting on the 13th, our representative Shi Zhaoji will have an urgent motion, stating that the Chinese government absolutely abides by the resolution of the League of Nations meeting on September 30th, and also asks the League of Nations to pay attention to the expansion of Japanese military actions in the Eastern Provinces and southern China. (November 12th, Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed Shi Zhaoji, requesting him to announce in detail to the League of Nations Council on the 13th the Japanese army's bombing of Jinzhou and the Japanese warships' show of force in China, and said that the Chinese government deeply believes that this matter concerns the prestige of the League of Nations and the location of humanitarian justice, and has sincerely advocated peace from the beginning. Now, the situation in the Eastern Provinces is becoming increasingly serious and complicated. Not only has the Japanese army not withdrawn, but its atrocities are even worse than before. It should be reported to the League of Nations based on reason. (November 12th, Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The British government today submitted to the League of Nations Secretariat the official report issued in Peiping on October 9th regarding the bombing of Jinzhou. The report briefly stated that the British Consul General in Tianjin learned that the Jinzhou Transportation Congress Hall, now the office of the Liaoning Provisional Government, was bombed by twelve Japanese aircraft throwing thirty to forty bombs at 1:30 p.m. on October 8th. It also stated that a foreign engineer of the Beining Railway reported that the Jinzhou locomotive yard was hit, killing five people and injuring fifteen. (November 11th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The special meeting of the League of Nations Council to consider the Manchurian situation may begin informally tonight. Currently, British Foreign Secretary Reading has arrived here at noon with Cecil. Council President, Spanish Foreign Minister Lerroux, is expected to arrive in the afternoon, and French Foreign Minister Briand and Italian Foreign Minister Grandi are expected to arrive in the evening. In any case, these five people will meet once tonight to exchange opinions informally. It is expected that U.S. Special Commissioner to Attend and Listen, U.S. Ambassador to Germany Wilson, will participate. At present, the atmosphere here is tense to the extreme, rumors are rampant, and speculation abounds. How the League of Nations will respond to China's request to dispatch an international investigation committee is the focus of public opinion, because it is expected that Japan will do its best to oppose it, even to the point of withdrawing from the League of Nations. It is said that the Japanese are now planning to propose a counter-proposal to make Manchuria a League of Nations-mandated territory, entrusted to Japan for trusteeship. However, the Chinese representatives believe that Manchuria has always been a part of China's entire territory, and this poisonous plan will hardly allow the Japanese to get their wish. (November 12th, National Electric Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Briand has departed from Paris for Geneva to participate in the League of Nations Administrative Council to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute. According to Briand, when the situation in the Far East becomes increasingly serious, he must personally come forward before going to Geneva. (November 12th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) News came tonight that China had sent an ultimatum to Japan, demanding that Japanese troops immediately withdraw to within the South Manchuria Railway zone. The news caused a shock here for a while, believing that the world would fall into a second war from now on. Although the state of panic subsided slightly after a while, the Manchurian Incident is becoming increasingly dangerous, and the future is indeed worrying. Although the League of Nations Council will convene a meeting on Tuesday, hope for whether it can mediate this crisis is indeed very slim. In addition, Japan sent a note to League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond today, stating that Japan absolutely cannot allow the League of Nations to interfere in the Eastern Provinces incident, because the League of Nations cannot be said to have fully understood it yet. (November 11th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Responds to Our First Note</h3>
<p>Withdrawal of Troops Must Be Conditional, Hoping for Direct Negotiations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's reply on the 9th to China's first note regarding the withdrawal of troops from Manchuria, the content of which was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 12th as follows:</p>
<p>We have heard the letter of October 5th. The first paragraph of the letter states that the Japanese representative formally declared in the League of Nations that all Japanese troops currently occupying various places will withdraw as soon as possible and restore the situation before September 18th. The final resolution of the Council also stated that Japanese troops should withdraw before the reconvening of the meeting on October 14th. The withdrawal of Japanese troops to the attached areas must be premised on ensuring the safety of the South Manchuria Railway and the stable life and property of Japanese residents in Manchuria, which has been repeatedly stated by the Japanese representative in the League of Nations. Furthermore, the resolution of the Council on September 30th did not mention that Japanese troops must withdraw before the reconvening of the Council meeting on October 14th. The views of the Japanese government on the matters mentioned in the latter part of the letter are as follows: Please be aware.</p>
<p>Currently, Chinese troops are gathering in various places occupied by the Japanese army, causing the Japanese army to feel threatened, just like when the incident first occurred. The Chinese army, which is advocating non-resistance, is resisting the Japanese army everywhere, causing many casualties to the Japanese army. The urgent task at hand is to seek to alleviate the feelings of the people. Therefore, it is necessary to agree on the fundamental outline first. This is an even more preliminary issue, so Japan very much hopes to meet with Chinese representatives. (November 12th, Japan United News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the request of the Japanese government, the League of Nations Secretary-General has released the Japanese government's reply of October 9th to the Chinese government's note of the 5th, which briefly stated that the withdrawal of Japanese troops in Manchuria into the railway zone must be conditional on the safety of the railway and Japanese residents in Manchuria. The current focus of the two countries is to calm public opinion in both countries, and then the Japanese army can withdraw into the railway zone, and Japan can also prepare to start negotiations with China immediately. The purpose of the Japanese army's actions along the South Manchuria Railway is to eliminate the more numerous Chinese troops with preventive measures, or to prevent the occurrence of harm. (November 11th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese representative forwarded the reply to China's request for the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops to the Council, the main content of which stated: (1) The resolution of the League of Nations Council on September 30th did not stipulate that Japanese troops must completely withdraw to the South Manchuria Railway attached areas before October 14th; (2) Since September 18th, all Japanese military actions in Manchuria have been purely a preventive measure, due to the large number of Chinese troops gathering nearby, posing a threatening situation; (3) These Chinese troops often cause unfortunate incidents in the vicinity; (4) The excitement of the people of China and Japan and the tension of the situation have greatly increased the danger of conflict; (5) Japan believes that only direct negotiations are a safe solution, and in the future, Japanese troops can be allowed to withdraw without the danger of conflict. Japan is now preparing to negotiate with any responsible representative of China. (November 11th, National News Agency)</p>
<h3>Our Side Demands That Japan Withdraw Troops Immediately</h3>
<p>Our Second Note to Japan, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Expresses Rejection</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese sources say that Nanjing's recent note demanding the withdrawal of Japanese troops outside the South Manchuria Railway zone within one week has the same meaning as the first note of October 5th. The Japanese government's reply to the first note was sent to the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo on the 9th, but because there were some points in the reply that were slightly unclear, the Chinese Embassy did not immediately forward the Japanese reply to Nanjing. Because the Chinese government did not receive a reply, it issued a second note, reiterating the previous request, but the wording was slightly stricter. It is said that when replying to the second note, Japan will only ask the Chinese government to refer to the reply of the 9th, because the first reply has already stated that Japan will never withdraw Japanese troops outside the South Manchuria Railway zone until the Chinese authorities have indicated that they can guarantee the safety of Japanese residents in Manchuria after the withdrawal of Japanese troops. This afternoon, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs repeatedly stated the reasons for Japan's opposition to interference by third parties and opposition to the League of Nations sending personnel to investigate the situation in Manchuria, and said that China's attempt to force the League of Nations to interfere will not facilitate the resolution of negotiations, but will make the resolution difficult, because foreign</p>

<p>pressure will only make the Japanese people indignant and undermine the efforts of the Japanese government to prevent the expansion of the serious situation. (November 12th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs today refused to accept the Chinese document requesting the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops to within the South Manchuria Railway line, and at the same time, Foreign Minister Shidehara informed Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zuobin that the Japanese government had notified both Nanjing and Geneva of its statements regarding the Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria. (November 12th, National Electric Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Chinese Political Council Passes a Reply to Japan</h3>
<p>The Main Points of Refuting the Japanese Memorandum are Decided to be Delivered to the Japanese Side Today</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Special Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on the 12th, attended by Dai Chuanxian, Ding Weifen, Yu Youren, Yan Huiqing, Gu Weijun, Zhu Peide, Shao Lizi, Shao Yuanchong, Kong Xiangxi, Chen Bulei, etc., to discuss the draft of the reply to Japan. As a result, it was revised and passed, and immediately submitted to the interim meeting of the Chinese Political Council. After it is passed, it will be delivered to the Japanese side. (November 12th, Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Chinese Political Council held an interim meeting at 4:00 p.m. on the 12th, attended by Jiang Zhongzheng, Dai Chuanxian, Yu Youren, Ding Weifen, Chen Guofu, Yang Shuzhuang, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Zhaoying, Chen Mingshu, etc., passed the reply to Japan and added Gu Weijun as a member of the Special Diplomatic Committee, and adjourned at 5:00 p.m. (November 12th, Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The initial draft of the reply to Japan was drafted by Yan Huiqing and revised by Dai Chuanxian. It refutes the four points raised by the Japanese side point by point, and the wording is extremely serious. It was originally scheduled for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to deliver this reply to the Japanese side that evening, and to be published simultaneously in Chinese and English. Later, it was considered too late and was changed to be sent out on the morning of the 13th. (November 12th, Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The main points of refuting the Japanese memorandum are now obtained from a certain source: 1. Pointing out that the Japanese army's sudden occupation of various places in Liaoning and Jilin is an act of disregarding international law and violating the covenants of the League of Nations, the Non-Aggression Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty. When the Japanese army invaded, there were even actions that were not allowed by international law in wartime. 2. China believes that since both China and Japan are signatories to the above-mentioned treaties, they should find ways to resolve disputes peacefully in terms of international obligations, so it submitted the matter to the League of Nations for handling. The League of Nations immediately decided to order Japan to withdraw its troops, and Japan has also indicated to the League of Nations that it is willing to accept the request. 3. Since the initial occurrence of the incident, the Chinese government has not taken any hostile actions, and at the same time, it has tried its best to restrain the indignation of the people across the country, so as not to overstep the legal boundaries. No accidents have occurred in the vast area within the scope of Chinese administrative power. The guarantee submitted by China to the League of Nations Administrative Council has been implemented thoroughly. 4. Choosing to buy goods is an individual's freedom. No government can interfere or prohibit it. The Chinese people's aversion to Japanese goods is aroused by the Japanese government's continuous unfriendly actions since the Wanbaoshan Incident. 5. While China is trying its best to prevent the expansion of the situation, the Japanese army not only has not implemented the withdrawal of troops, but also continues to invade, even bombing Jinzhou, the location of the Liaoning Provisional Government, and other places with airplanes, and sending a large number of warships to China. The recent aggravation of the situation within ten days is all caused by the Japanese side. 6. China is in an extremely difficult position due to the continuous invasion of the Japanese army, but it still tries its best to protect Japanese residents. However, Japan still uses military force as a tool for implementing national policy, and Japan should bear the responsibility for any unfortunate consequences that may arise from this.

<h3>Important Figures in the Japanese Political World are Deeply Afraid of International Interference</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In view of the tendency of the League of Nations and the United States to expand their actions on the Manchurian Incident, Wakatsuki visited Count Yamamoto, Count Kiyoura, Takahashi Korekiyo, etc. this afternoon at 3:00 p.m. to report on the government's policy and attitude, and explained it to seek understanding. (November 12th, Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Manchurian Incident has now gradually shown a trend of international importance. The Japanese government, needless to say, and other parties such as senior officials, the Privy Council, and the House of Peers are all worried about the outcome beyond party lines. After meeting with Foreign Minister Shidehara and Interior Minister Adachi today, Prime Minister Wakatsuki also visited Count Yamamoto, Takahashi Korekiyo, Count Kiyoura, etc. to explain the situation in Manchuria in detail and seek understanding. (November 12th, Japan United News Agency) (Tokyo) Count Kiyoura visited Makino Naifu this afternoon to discuss the current situation for two hours. The topics discussed included the China issue, the financial bureau issue, and the political instability issue, which shows that senior figures among the Japanese elders are quite worried about the current situation. (November 12th, Japan United News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This afternoon, Army Minister Minami met with the Japanese Emperor to report on the recent changes in the Manchurian situation. (November 12th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Reserve Army Club has now petitioned the Ministry of the Army to speak for the government and submit a resolution passed by the club, which briefly stated that the Japanese Navy and Army Reserve Army believe that the interference of third parties in Sino-Japanese negotiations should be absolutely rejected. The club unanimously approves the policy that the current military status quo in Manchuria must be maintained in order to establish the peace and order of Manchuria and the Far East on a permanent basis. In addition to being delivered to the Army Minister by the chairman of the club, General Suzuki, a copy of this resolution was also sent to the Chief of the General Staff. The club claims to have three million members. (November 12th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Reuters reporters, the feelings of the highest political circles here are that the Japanese government is very uneasy about China's attempt to force the League of Nations to interfere in the Manchurian dispute. It is now believed that the Japanese government is prepared to open direct negotiations with any responsible representative of China, but opposes the suggestion of external interference. In addition to fearing that the interference of third parties will weaken its efforts to prevent the expansion of the situation, the Japanese government also feels that Japan has never tried to demand new concessions or special rights, but only wants to demand respect for the rights and special rights that should be available under the current treaty. In other words, if this solution is successful with the help of a third party, China will always think that Japan is forced by external forces and dare not propose more harsh conditions. In other words, Japan is prepared to propose more lenient conditions, but does not want people to think that Japan's mild attitude is due to external pressure. The Japanese reply to the League of Nations was originally scheduled to be issued last night, but it was delayed until this afternoon. It is said that the text still states: (1) Japan has tried its best to prevent the increase in the Manchurian situation; (2) Japan advocates direct negotiations with China and is not subject to interference from third parties; (3) Except for the possible sporadic incidents of sending troops to the railway zone to protect Koreans and suppress bandits, there will be no new developments in Manchuria; (4) China must be held responsible for the increase in the situation in the Yangtze River basin. The dispatch of Japanese warships to various ports in the Yangtze River is purely for the purpose of protecting the lives and property of Japanese residents; (5) Stating the difficulties of the Japanese army failing to immediately withdraw to various locations within the South Manchuria Railway zone, because it must first guarantee that China has the ability to guarantee the maintenance of public security and order; (6) Declaring that Japan is convinced that the permanent cooperation between China and Japan can benefit both parties, so it is urgently necessary to restore normal relations based on fundamental principles. Today, Prime Minister Wakatsuki visited Prime Ministers Yamamoto, Takahashi, and Kiyoura. People in Tokyo paid great attention to this and made various speculations. The nature of it is unknown, but it is widely believed that it is related to the Manchurian situation or because the cabinet is about to start a storm. (November 12th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Seeking Zhang's Resignation</h3>
<p>Zhang's Talk with Reuters Reporter</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Xueliang told a Reuters reporter this morning, referring to the Japanese authorities' request for Zhang's resignation, saying that Japan wants to develop the Manchurian independence movement, so it is natural to have this request. Chinese people here all believe that the Japanese military authorities have decided to establish an independent country in Manchuria and Mongolia as a preparation for future annexation, as was previously done in Korea. The Chinese also believe that the Japanese's request for Zhang Xueliang to resign is an unreasonable act of interfering in other countries' internal affairs. (November 12th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Xueliang went to the artillery factory outside Xibianmen this afternoon to play golf, accompanied by only a few people. (November 12th, Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Jiang Zuobin Had a Secret Talk with Shidehara Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Tonight, Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zuobin had a secret talk with Foreign Minister Shidehara for three hours to discuss the withdrawal of troops from Manchuria. Jiang said to others that although today's talks were informal, there will still be similar discussions in the future. (November 12th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Responds to the League of Nations Notification</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government replied to the second notification of the Chairman of the League of Nations Council on October 10th on October 12th as follows: (1) Regarding the Manchurian Incident, the Japanese government is eager to prevent the expansion of the situation, ensure the lives and property of Japanese residents in the South Manchuria Railway and the local area, and implement the policy of withdrawing Japanese troops to their original defenses. At the same time, it believes that the only way to satisfactorily resolve the incident is to wait for direct negotiations. Now,</p>
<p>In accordance with this purpose, I hereby reply to the notification of the Chairman of the Council to serve as a reference for the final resolution of the Council. (2) Although military actions have come to an end, there are often abnormal developments, such as the dispatch of Japanese troops to Jinzhou to assist Koreans and the sniping of Japanese aircraft engaged in reconnaissance by Chinese troops, and the throwing of bombs due to resistance. If we understand the situation at the time, we will naturally agree. If we hastily believe that the reflected facts have the nature of expanding the situation, it can be said that we do not understand the truth. (November 12th, Japan United News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese representative informed the Council that because China could not assume the responsibility of protecting the lives and property of Japanese residents in Manchuria, the Japanese military authorities had to abandon the decision to withdraw troops and only withdraw Japanese troops from places where there were agencies sufficient to maintain order. Moreover, because Japanese residents felt more insecure in places where Japanese troops were not stationed, it was extremely difficult to restore Manchuria to its original state. The Japanese representative also reported to the League of Nations Council at the end of the week that the anti-Japanese movement in mainland China was intensifying, and Japanese consulates along the Yangtze River had withdrawn. A number of other local Japanese consulates had also been ordered to prepare to leave. Japanese residents in China were mostly preparing to withdraw. (November 11th, National News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Will Make a Statement to the United States</h3>
<p>Still Trying to Defend Military Actions</p>
<p>(Washington) It is heard that Japanese Ambassador Debuchi will deliver a statement of the Japanese government's attitude to the U.S. government tomorrow. The Japanese still believe that outsiders misunderstand the motives of its actions in Manchuria, and the military actions that have been reported are inevitably exaggerated. They want to defend themselves and explain that all their actions are solely for the purpose of protecting the lives and property of Japanese residents, which is within the bounds of reason, in the hope of deceiving the people of the world. (November 11th, National Electric Dispatch)</p>
<h3>To Stop Anti-Japanese Sentiment, the Japanese Must First Reflect</h3>
<p>A Certain Important Figure Talks About the Contents of the Reply</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese government's memorandum to the Chinese National Government was delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Japanese Minister Shigemitsu at 10:00 a.m. on the 11th. The reporter therefore went to visit a certain important figure to inquire about our attitude. According to him, the current anti-Japanese movement of the Chinese people was entirely caused by the Japanese atrocities in the Three Eastern Provinces. Japan has occupied the land of the Three Eastern Provinces and killed the people of the Three Eastern Provinces without cause. People across the country, driven by righteous indignation, have risen to resist, organized anti-Japanese salvation associations, and severed economic ties with Japan to urge the Japanese side to reflect. It is entirely a manifestation of the patriotic spirit of the people. If there is no illegal behavior, the government cannot stop it. Moreover, the Japanese government, despite violating international law, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and the Anti-War Treaty, has repeatedly committed atrocities against us, while the National Government has always been calm, respected the League of Nations resolution, and sought a proper solution. It has done its best to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents in China. Since the incident on September 18th, Japanese residents in various places under the rule of the National Government have been safe as before and have not suffered any damage, which is clear evidence of the thorough protection of the National Government and the non-illegal actions of the Chinese people. Japanese atrocities in China are piled up, but the Chinese people can still obey the government's orders and abide by order, and have no illegal behavior other than peaceful resistance. This kind of patience has moved all countries in the world. If the Japanese were in our position, what would their actions be like? The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will refute based on these reasons. Although yesterday was Sunday, the special foreign affairs staff still held a meeting to discuss the reply. It is estimated that another meeting will be held today to finalize the wording and then send it to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The important figure finally said that if the Japanese government hopes that the Chinese people will stop the anti-Japanese movement, it must first reflect, respect the League of Nations resolution, immediately withdraw its troops from the Three Eastern Provinces, and restore the situation before September 18th. The Japanese government not only has no such indication, but also sends more warships to China to show force and intimidate, and bombs Jinzhou with airplanes, killing military and civilians, and trying to overthrow the Liaoning Provisional Government. The anti-Japanese movement of the Chinese people will inevitably become more intense. The Japanese government cannot but be responsible for the disputes caused by this.

<h3>The League of Nations' Final Hour</h3>
<p>The League of Nations, given the increasingly serious situation in Northeast China, will reconvene its Administrative Council today to discuss a final solution. Diplomatic authorities from Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Spain, and the US Minister to Sweden will all be in attendance, gathering the world's politicians and diplomats to discuss and deal with the serious crisis that threatens the world. All those who sincerely love peace and humanity undoubtedly hope that they can overcome all difficulties and achieve a final, fair, and reasonable solution to the current grave situation between China and Japan.</p>
<p>However, considering all the facts, our hopes may not be very optimistic. One aspect of the problem lies in whether the Japanese are willing to accept the advice of world justice and restrain their ambition to seize Northeast China and dominate East Asia. The other aspect lies in whether the League of Nations can consistently base its judgments on justice and make firm and effective judgments based on the Covenant. If it cannot, then the League of Nations itself will be strangled by the giant hand of the Japanese and die prematurely, and the world situation will immediately fall into a very pessimistic and tragic state. Therefore, it is said that the League of Nations has now entered its final hour, and the world has reached a crossroads between peace and war.</p>
<p>Judging from the recent actions of the Japanese, we have no way to guarantee that the Japanese have the sincerity to restrain their deliberate acts of aggression against the world. When the League of Nations closed its meeting on the 30th of last month, it resolved that both China and Japan must exercise restraint and that the Japanese army must completely withdraw from Chinese territory and restore the situation to before September 18th. The Japanese representative, Yoshizawa, had promised to comply in full. However, as of today, the Japanese army has not only not withdrawn but has also attacked Jinzhou, secretly supporting the movement of the Mongol royalists in Northeast China for independence. At the same time, they have dispatched a large number of warships to various ports along our river, making all kinds of threats and intimidation. Anyone can understand that this kind of action is intentionally stirring up the terrible black tide of the world, intentionally betraying international trust, and intentionally strangling the League of Nations and putting it to death. Only fools would believe that the Japanese can bow to the demands of the League of Nations in this administrative meeting.</p>
<p>China has maintained an absolutely calm attitude from beginning to end. Although the emotions of the Chinese people have reached a fever pitch due to intolerable acts of violence, they have never made any serious preparations or actions that would escalate the situation. As long as the League of Nations has not indicated that it will abandon this issue, China still sincerely hopes that the League of Nations can find a complete solution to this problem, and still sincerely hopes that the governments of all countries can fulfill their responsibilities under the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty to protect the supreme dignity of the international community. However, if unfortunately, the League of Nations indicates that it will give up, making it impossible for China to obtain justice in the international community, then the facts will cause China to despair of justice and have no choice but to rise up and defend itself. The result will inevitably be that China and Japan will formally engage in war. At that time, once a war breaks out in the Far East, world commerce will suffer a serious blow. Adding a fatal blow to this period of global economic depression will cause countries to suffer unpredictable impacts and cause unpredictable disputes, and the world situation will change to an unpredictable state. In short, the current issue is not only a dispute between countries; its crisis can escalate at any time and turn the world upside down, plunging the entire world into an irredeemable catastrophe.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Therefore, the League of Nations is now undoubtedly facing the most arduous task and is trapped in the most difficult predicament. However, if the League of Nations truly has the determination to safeguard peace and justice, maintain its own life, and save humanity from its final doom, then it need not be concerned about the complexity and difficulty of the current issue, and it will naturally have effective measures to deal with it urgently.</p>
<p>Does the League of Nations truly have this determination? Only the League of Nations itself can answer. Let us hold our breath and wait and see how the League of Nations overcomes its final hour.</p>

<p>(Harbin) Kanto Army Commander Honjo issued a proclamation on the 10th, stating that the Japanese army's dispatch has, within a short period of ten days, allowed the people of Northeast China to be resurrected and reborn from deep misery.

The army considers all such anti-Japanese and insulting acts of resistance, regardless of who they are committed by, and will not only order subordinates to strictly arrest and severely punish them, but will also resolutely suppress them to cut off the roots of the chaos, so that the people of Northeast China can live and work in peace.

<h3>Japan Disgraces Civilization</h3>
<p>Comments in the British and American Press</p>
<p>A leading article in the *London Times* this morning stated that the Japanese view that the League of Nations should simply advise the Nanjing government to surrender quickly to the enemy in response to China's complaints cannot be accepted by the League of Nations, and that Japan's military actions in Manchuria should be included in the scope of Article 15 of the League of Nations Charter and cannot be defended. The Japanese government's allowing or failing to prevent repeated military actions has placed it in a wrong position and also clearly violates the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Japan, as a civilized country that has always prided itself on abiding by international obligations, has now lowered its standards, which is regrettable. The Chinese government is now completely at the disposal of the League of Nations, but it would be tragic if it were to switch to an impatient or indignant or disappointed plan. Foreign Minister Li Ding has now gone to Geneva, which shows the British government's emphasis on the actions of the League of Nations, because if the League of Nations fails even slightly, it will cause great chaos in China. Moreover, in terms of the current situation in Europe, once the prestige of the League of Nations is hit, the World Disarmament Conference will have extremely unfavorable results. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

The *New York Times* stated that the steps currently being taken by the League of Nations are supported by the United States. Washington is willing to fully cooperate with the League of Nations, but if the United States takes action, it will still do so alone. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Serious Fiscal Problems, Imminent Political Change in Japan</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Tokyo, 12th: Rumors are circulating in Tokyo today that the organization of a national government, with the Governor-General of Korea, General Ugaki, as its leader, is currently under consideration. Recently, the Finance Minister's austerity policy has been met with opposition, and his firm refusal to consider the ban on gold exports is also unpopular. According to informed sources, the Finance Minister is willing to resign to insist on his position. If he resigns, the cabinet will naturally resign in its entirety, and the Seiyukai party has a minority in the Diet, so it cannot take power without a general election. Therefore, it is the consensus that if the Minseito cabinet fails, a national government will be organized with Ugaki as its leader to deal with the serious problems facing the country.</p>
<h3>German Right-Wing Parties Unite to Overthrow the Government</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Harzburg, 11th: Today, various flags were flying over Harzburg Spa, but there was no flag of the German Republic. Youths in brown military uniforms were working diligently. Hitler's party members were dressed in gray military uniforms and wearing helmets. In addition, people driving motorcycles were shuttling back and forth, as if delivering important documents in wartime. This was the first meeting of the National Socialist Party and the Conservative Party to oppose the Brüning government. The leader of the National Socialist Party, Hitler, was a prominent figure at the meeting. Other major representatives included Dr. Hugenberg, leader of the German National People's Party, General von Seeckt, a representative of the National Party, Dr. Schacht, former president of the Reichsbank, and others. Schacht is now practically a member of Hitler's party. Among the representatives were also well-known industrialists, several former Imperial Army commanders, and former German Emperor's son, Prince Friedrich, etc. After the meeting, a manifesto was issued demanding the immediate resignation of the Brüning government and the Prussian government, the holding of general elections, and the organization of a true national government. The parties participating in the meeting vowed to oppose Brüning and will all cast votes of no confidence when the Reichstag convenes on Tuesday. However, it is expected that Brüning will still not fall and will maintain his power through more stringent emergency decrees. In his speech at the meeting, Schacht detailed the darkness of the German economic situation, stating that German productivity has been reduced by one-third, the huge number of unemployed in Germany will never change, and German foreign debt exceeds the amount announced by the government, as the public would be shocked if it were revealed. The gold reserves of the Deutsche Bank cannot meet demand, he said.</p>

<h3>Piłsudski Arrives in Bucharest</h3>
<p>Agence Centrale de Presse dispatch from Bucharest, 11th: Polish dictator General Józef Piłsudski arrived here today with a large entourage. Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Titulescu and the entire cabinet were at the station to welcome him. The Romanian government has also prepared a grand residence for Piłsudski to stay in. In the afternoon, Romanian King Carol II met with Piłsudski and the Romanian Prime Minister, as well as the Polish Minister to Romania, and had a lively conversation for over an hour. Although Piłsudski's visit to Bucharest is ostensibly for recuperation, it has considerable political significance. The greatest aim is to re-establish a military alliance with the Kingdom of Romania. Previously, Prince Nicolae of Romania had personally visited Poland to prepare for this matter, and it is said to have taken concrete form. Furthermore, the Russo-Polish non-aggression pact is also rumored to be under discussion. It is said that Piłsudski will go to the Black Sea coast for a short rest after finishing his business.</p>

<h3>Repercussions of the Manchurian Incident in the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Chinese Representative Lodges Protest</p>
<p>Japanese Representative Deliberately Evades Responsibility</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Geneva, September 19th: During the 75th regular session of the Council of the League of Nations, the representatives of China and Japan each made insignificant statements, as previously reported by the correspondent. On the 22nd, the Council of the League of Nations, at the request of the Chinese representative, convened an emergency meeting, still chaired by Spanish Foreign Minister Lerroux. First, Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji spoke, detailing the course of the incident caused by the Japanese army (based on two telegrams from the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which domestic newspapers likely have recorded, so it will be omitted here). Then, based on Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant, he requested the Council to promptly find a way to prevent the expansion of the situation and restore the pre-war state as soon as possible to estimate the extent of the losses. Finally, Shi stated that the Chinese government would be very happy to adopt any suggestions or decisions made by the League of Nations. After Shi finished speaking, Japanese representative Yoshizawa spoke. The Japanese representative, as he had not received instructions from his home country and was also logically and rhetorically weak, trembled constantly while speaking, much to the amusement of onlookers. The full text of his speech is translated as follows: "I am the first person to hate the unfortunate incident that occurred in Manchuria. After receiving instructions from my government, I will make a statement regarding this matter to respond to the Chinese representative. Before receiving these instructions, I will first make a few points to provide a clear observation of this issue. If we want to have a clear observation of this issue, we must conduct a proper investigation of the location where the incident occurred. Manchuria is a vast land, and my country enjoys great rights there under treaties, as you all know. Hundreds of thousands of Japanese live there. In this vast area, China has nearly 220,000 troops stationed, while Japan, according to treaties, only has 10,000 troops stationed. Even in Shenyang, the Chinese army has reached over 24,000 troops, while the Japanese army only has one infantry company. Therefore, at the location where the incident occurred, the ratio between the Chinese and Japanese armies is 24,000 to 500. After knowing these numbers, it will not be difficult for you to infer the nature of this conflict. The Chinese representative said that the Chinese troops did not provoke the Manchurian incident. This is merely a simple assertion without clear evidence. According to official information I have received, this conflict was caused by the Chinese army demolishing a section of the Japanese railway near Shenyang. Therefore, a small number of Japanese troops had no choice but to use armed self-defense to prevent this kind of destruction. The purpose of the Japanese occupation of several important cities in Manchuria is to prevent unexpected disturbances and protect the lives and property of the South Manchurian Railway and the Japanese residents living in that area. The Chinese representative claimed that the Chinese troops did not resist, which is completely contrary to the facts. Even in Changchun, the Japanese army suffered more than 150 casualties. Fortunately, the situation is now relatively calm. What we must pay attention to is that this incident did not arise from a single fact. There are causes and consequences that led to this great turmoil. I have said that Japan enjoys great rights in Manchuria based on international treaties. In addition, unfortunate incidents have occurred one after another since the beginning of this year, such as the assassination of Captain Nakamura, which were all sufficient to create a tense atmosphere and affect the relations between the two countries. This incident is merely the eruption of this long-brewing tense situation. The Chinese representative intends to demand compensation for losses. I really cannot understand this kind of demand because the responsibility for this disaster should be borne by the Chinese army. Since the Council is handling this case in accordance with Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant, the Council should not make this unreasonable demand before resolving this matter. As for restoring the pre-war state, it will not help unless representatives go to the scene to investigate the actual situation. Therefore, before receiving instructions from my government regarding this matter, I am very unwilling to express any opinions. I firmly believe that a peaceful solution can be achieved through direct negotiations between China and Japan. After receiving instructions from my government, I will report to the Council. Under these circumstances, I request the Council to discuss this issue again at the next meeting."</p>
<p>After the Japanese representative finished speaking, Shi Zhaoji stated that he was unwilling to have direct negotiations with Japan until the Japanese troops withdrew from Chinese territory. The Japanese representative replied, "The proposal for direct negotiations comes from an important person in the Nanjing government who currently holds an important position, and it is not a baseless rumor." After the Chinese and Japanese representatives debated each other, British representative Cecil also stood up and spoke, saying, "The effective method to resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict is to follow the precedent of resolving the conflict between Greece and Bulgaria over a sentry two years ago (presided over by Briand). Therefore, the chairing president of the Council should telegraph the Chinese and Japanese governments not to expand the turmoil or hinder the progress of a peaceful solution so that the pre-war state can be restored as soon as possible, and the enemy troops should immediately withdraw to their respective countries." The British representative's remarks were implicitly directed at the Japanese representative, so the Japanese representative was very dissatisfied. It was close to noon, so the meeting was adjourned. At 4:20 PM, the meeting continued. The Japanese representative briefly mentioned the country's position in Manchuria again and insisted that a concrete decision could only be made after receiving instructions from his government. After the Japanese representative spoke, Chinese representative Shi exclaimed loudly, "The current situation is even more serious. If you knew the contents of the telegrams in my hand, you would be even more surprised!" After Shi finished speaking, Chairman Lerroux also expressed his personal views, saying, "I and the other Council members present have paid very close attention to the statements of the Chinese and Japanese representatives. The Japanese representative's request to postpone the discussion of this issue until the next meeting can be accommodated. Now, I request the Council to first make the following proposals: (1) Notify the Chinese and Japanese governments not to expand the conflict or hinder the progress of a peaceful solution. (2) After consulting with the Chinese and Japanese representatives, find a proper solution so that both countries can withdraw their troops as soon as possible to avoid loss of life and property. In addition, I propose to send all meeting minutes regarding this matter to the United States in the form of a notification." The final proposal was at the instigation of the British representative. He believed that Japan's dispatch of troops to Manchuria violated the Nine-Power Treaty on the Protection of China's Territorial Integrity and the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1922, both of which the United States had signed, so the United States should be invited to participate this time. All representatives had no objection to the Chairman's proposal, so telegrams were sent to the governments of China and Japan. This is the situation of today's meeting. After the meeting adjourned, the representatives of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain held another meeting, which was not open to the public. The Chinese and Japanese representatives took turns expressing their opinions, but ultimately, the meeting adjourned without results because the positions of the two sides were too far apart.

<h3>Record of On-the-Spot Investigation After Japanese Planes Bombed Jinzhou</h3>
<p>A Special Correspondent's Travelogue for This Newspaper: After the Liaoning Provincial Government moved to Jin County, I had already anticipated that Japanese planes would certainly come to wreak havoc. As expected, on the afternoon of the 8th, at approximately 2:00 PM, twelve aircraft flew in from Yingkou and dropped dozens of bombs. I received the report at 5:00 PM that afternoon and immediately departed on train No. 101 of the Beining Railway at 12:00 AM that night to investigate the actual situation. At the East Station platform, I saw more than ten Japanese, all appearing to be merchants. Beside them were five or six women and children, clutching at their clothes, weeping and sobbing, looking deeply distressed. I guessed that these ten or so men were likely being called back to Japan by the Japanese government to serve in the military. Because of their deep affection for their children, they were shedding tears of farewell. After the train passed Tanggu, this group of Japanese disembarked. My guess was likely correct. On the same train as I was, there was a man who resembled a Russian but claimed to be Czech. Upon hearing that Japanese military planes had dropped bombs in Jin County, he was very anxious and asked if I could change routes in Qinhuangdao or Goubangzi to go to Shenyang for safety. I told him that there were no merchant ships going to Dalian from Qinhuangdao, that Yingkou was occupied by the Japanese military and the Yingkou-Goubangzi branch line was not open. It would be best to return to Tianjin, take a ship to Dalian, and then transfer to a train to Shenyang. However, he was unwilling to go through so much trouble and smiled, saying, "The bandits outside the Guan don't reason, and the Japanese are even more unreasonable than the bandits." He also said, "The Japanese are destroying your country and occupying your territory like this, how does your Chinese government deal with it?" I was truly ashamed, almost speechless. Then I began to tell him, "We are a weak country, and Japan oppresses us everywhere. We make concessions everywhere in order to seek the arbitration of international justice. However, the spirit of our people is not weak. If we declare war on Japan, then it will not be just a matter between China and Japan, but it will probably cause a conflict of interests in the Far East among international powers." He nodded in agreement. After the train passed Tangshan, I fell asleep. The next morning (the 9th), the train arrived at Beidaihe at 7:00 AM. The morning sun was just rising. Looking out at the seashore, it was shrouded in mist and clouds. Recalling how Zhang Xueliang had spent the summer at the beach last year, with officials gathering from all sides, making it the center of the political situation, I, in order to gather news, had also stayed at the beach for ten days. Considering the past and present, I couldn't help but feel emotional. At 8:00 AM, we passed Qinhuangdao. From afar, I saw several giant ships anchored at sea, with plumes of black smoke rising into the sky. Asking at the station, I learned that there were two Japanese warships, one American warship, and one Northeastern warship. The Japanese ships had been there for two days. Sailors would come ashore to scout from time to time, and at night, searchlights shone everywhere, making the people feel uneasy. The local Japanese and Korean residents had already evacuated. The Chinese garrison set up checkpoints at various intersections on the beach every day for security. At 9:00 AM, we arrived at Shanhaiguan. There were three or five Japanese soldiers at the station, patrolling back and forth, carrying guns and glaring at us. At 12:00 noon, we passed Xingcheng. I inquired about the situation in Jin County with the stationmaster. According to him, since the Japanese planes dropped bombs yesterday, they have not returned as of now. The Chinese and foreign passengers on the train looked relieved when they heard this. At 2:30 PM, we arrived at Jin County. According to Meng Qinnan, the section chief of the train management department, twelve Japanese planes took off from Yingkou on the afternoon of the 8th. When they passed the Dawa Station, the station immediately received a long-distance phone call notifying them. The notification was immediately reported to the Liaoning Provincial Government and the Northeast Commander-in-Chief's Office. At about 2:15 PM, twelve planes swarmed in, flying very low, no more than a hundred feet from the ground. From the station to Jiaotong University, all were within the bombed area. At that time, the whole city was shaken, order was chaotic, and the station staff fled. The situation was bleak, as if in a dark prison. It can be inferred that the Japanese side's intention to drop bombs was definitely a planned arrangement beforehand. From the bombing points, it is clear. The Northeast Border Defense Army Commander-in-Chief's Office was located at Tian Tai Inn (outside the station), and the Liaoning Provincial Government was located at Jiaotong University. The Japanese also received intelligence that Mi Chunlin and Rong Zhen were stationed on special trains. Therefore, the locomotive roundhouse suffered a tragedy. At 2:45 PM, after the planes left, the railway bureau staff gradually returned to the station. Witnessing the tragic deaths and injuries, everyone was in tears. Timid workers fled again. But the responsible officers of each section served in the smoke and rain of bombs and did not leave their posts. After the planes dropped bombs, they also strafed with machine guns. The Japanese were thorough and very vicious. But what they did not expect was that when they dropped bombs, Chairman Mi, Director Rong, and others were holding a meeting at the residence of Deputy Adjutant Song (Shoushan). As a result, only dozens of our civilians were killed and injured. Provincial government members Xing Shilian and Zhang Zhenlu took a special train to Ping last night at 10:00 PM. Chairman Mi is scheduled to go to Ping tonight. After I finished talking with Section Chief Meng, I began to conduct an on-the-spot inspection. A bomb landed next to the changing room of the south side door of the station, creating a pit two feet deep in the cinder ground, with a diameter of about five feet. After the bomb landed, it exploded, destroying the south side door. The shrapnel pierced the railway tracks in four places, and obliquely damaged more than ten places. The locomotive roundhouse was located to the side of it. The glass windows, more than ten feet high, arranged in thirty rows, were all shattered into powder. The walls made of rubble had fifty or sixty shrapnel marks. A careful examination of the explosion area showed that it reached about 300 meters, with a range of about 150 meters. Each bomb weighed at least 50 pounds. According to Deputy Section Chief Zhang Lingyun, the bomb was about three feet long, empty at the top and solid at the bottom, with a diameter of about one foot. He was near the locomotive roundhouse yesterday when he was suddenly attacked by planes, with a bomb dropping in front of and behind him, each only two or three hundred yards away. He quickly laid flat on the ground to avoid it. Shrapnel brushed past him, fortunately without injury. He could be said to have escaped from death. In the coal yard in front of the west locomotive roundhouse, a total of three bombs landed, killing the coal worker foreman Xian Ruide, stokers Su Peisheng, Wang Chuntian, Hu Yunhan, track worker Liu Mengling, and five others. Seven people were injured, including coal worker foreman Li Zhongsan, coal worker Long Chaogan, material worker Shen Tong, stoker Cui Zhiqi, and contracted coal handler Zhang Chunwen. The seven injured were sent to the railway hospital. Zhang Chunwen died this afternoon due to his injuries. Of the three bombs, one landed on the coal worker dormitory, collapsing half of the wall and severing the wires. The railway tracks were pierced in four places, and damaged obliquely in more than ten places. Another bomb landed in the center of the coal yard, and another landed next to an empty train, destroying the doors and windows of the No. 117 first-class carriage, the No. 141 postal car, and the No. 156 official car. One staff member on the official car was injured in the finger by shrapnel, and the small water tank was shattered. Two bombs landed near the headquarters of the 12th Brigade (Zhang Tingzhu) outside the east gate, killing seven men, two women, and one child. One bomb landed outside the flag flying at the east of the station, killing one man. One bomb landed on the bridge hole of the staff residential area at the east of the station, killing one old woman. Two bombs landed behind the residential building of the train management section chief, killing two men. One bomb landed behind the locomotive roundhouse, killing a family of six men and women in a civilian house. Broken limbs and bones, cracked brains and flowing intestines, the scene was too horrible to look at. One bomb landed next to Tiancheng Inn outside the station, completely destroying the fresh goods bureau, killing three men. The purpose of this bomb was to bomb the Commander-in-Chief's Office at Tian Tai Inn, but it landed slightly off target and did not hit, only destroying the fresh goods bureau completely. One bomb landed in front of the post office next to the station, and the doors and windows were all shattered by shrapnel, injuring one mail car driver and one mule. One bomb landed next to the west of the Commander-in-Chief's Office, killing a father and son surnamed Tao, and one person surnamed Wang, with seven injured. Three bombs landed in the courtyard of the old site of Yuanhe Inn at the south end of the train yard, killing five locomotive workers and injuring two. One bomb landed outside the locomotive roundhouse wall, killing a poor coal picker named Liu Dunfu. One bomb landed at the Sha family graveyard near the station, killing a woman surnamed Li. One bomb landed at the radio station, only destroying one wall of the building. Three bombs landed in the courtyard of a family surnamed Sun north of the firewood market outside the east gate, killing Duan Sun and her two daughters. Two bombs landed at the barber shop in the Jiaohu alley of the firewood market, with shrapnel shooting in through the window, killing two men. One man was killed outside the house. Two bombs landed in the Sanyihe courtyard on Shizhuzi Street outside the east gate. One bomb landed on a pile of coal and did not explode. The remaining bomb collapsed more than two feet of the courtyard wall. One bomb landed on the west end of the station's young marshal's building, killing one woman. Jiaotong University, as the location of the Liaoning Provincial Government, was the target of Japanese aircraft bombing. A careful examination of the school, both inside and outside the courtyards, revealed twelve bomb craters. The fierceness and magnitude of the bombing was even greater than that of the bombs dropped near the station. It can be known that the weight of the bomb was undoubtedly 80 pounds. The school walls, doors, and windows were broken and scattered everywhere, which was shocking. One of the bombs shot through the glass window of Xing Shilian's office, turning the desk into a web shape. If Xing was working inside, he would certainly have been unlucky. Fortunately, the school had already closed and the students had dispersed, so only one Russian professor was seriously injured. When I went to inspect, the wooden sign of the Liaoning Provincial Government outside the door had already been removed, with only a few soldiers guarding it. Based on the above investigation, the Japanese planes had dropped as many as forty-three bombs. Fearing that time was short, there might still be omissions. A total of thirty-six people were killed and twenty-one were seriously injured, including those whose names are unknown, mostly poor refugees who had fled from Shenyang. They have now been prepared with coffins and buried by the county government and the station, respectively, and sent to hospitals for treatment. The number of those who were slightly injured was very large, and it was impossible to investigate and count them for a while. After my investigation was completed, I planned to visit Mi Chunlin, Rong Zhen, Peng Jiqun and others, but I could not find them anywhere. I had to retreat and seek the next best thing, going directly to the county government in the city to visit County Chief Gu Jinsheng. I was received by him. According to him, since the Japanese army invaded Liaoji, Japanese military planes had come to Jin twice to demonstrate. The other day, forty-four local Japanese and Korean residents requested protection to leave the country. I immediately sent personnel to ask the railway bureau to prepare a train for transportation, and took good care of them along the way, so they safely arrived in Shenyang. The Japanese Consul Goto stationed in Tianjin and the Japanese Consul Hayashi Hisashi stationed in Liaoning have both sent telegrams to express their gratitude, and asked me to protect the property of Japanese and Korean residents on their behalf. However, when these residents left the country, they did not hand over the remaining property, so how can I be responsible for protecting it? However, I have ordered the Public Security Bureau to inform the caretakers of the residences of Japanese and Korean residents to take good care of them. Based on this incident alone, our country can be said to have treated Japanese and Korean residents with utmost kindness. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, the Japanese army suddenly sent twelve military planes to drop bombs, resulting in a large number of innocent people being killed and injured. At that time, the whole city was shocked, with wailing and running, the sound shaking the streets. After the investigation, skulls were rotten, abdomens were broken, intestines were flowing, and blood and flesh were blurred. The people of my Jin County have no hatred or resentment against the Japanese military and civilians, so why did this inhuman incident occur? The 100,000 lives in the city and suburbs were plunged into a stormy sea. I have the responsibility to protect the local safety and peace. In addition to sending a telegram to Deputy Commander Zhang and the provincial government, I also sent a telegram to the Japanese consuls in Shenyang and Niuzhuang today, asking them to earnestly inform the Japanese military authorities and not to send military planes to drop bombs again in order to maintain humanity. At the same time, I also received righteous words from the local YMCA, the American Gospel Church, the French Catholic Church and other foreigners, and jointly with the county farmers' association, labor union, chamber of commerce, education association, lawyers' association and other public organizations, sent telegrams to the commanders and deputy commanders Jiang and Zhang, and telegrams to the Administrative Council of the League of Nations in Geneva, governments of all countries, and diplomatic envoys and consuls of all countries in China, describing the tragedy and asking them to earnestly inform the Japanese authorities not to drop bombs again. Since the afternoon of the 8th, all the large and small shops outside the city have been closed, and have not opened today. Although I have tried to persuade them, it has had no effect. The city was not bombed yesterday and is operating as usual. The 7th Brigade of Wang Yizhe's troops has had news of stationing in Jin since withdrawing from the Beida Camp in Shenyang on the night of the 18th of last month. The housing for the troops has been found here. As of now, they are still in Qingyuan County. The Commander-in-Chief's Office has telegraphed the county, ordering it to allocate funds from tax revenues to provide for the brigade. The defense of this county is still undertaken by the 12th Brigade of Zhang Tingzhu's troops, mostly stationed in Juliu River. The defense of Dahushan is undertaken by the 17th Brigade of Sun Dequan's troops. Since the Japanese army occupied Xinmin County, in order to avoid misunderstandings, there are no troops stationed between Raoyang River and Xinmin, resulting in rampant banditry. Since the tragedy yesterday, this county has issued proclamations everywhere, advising people to dig basements day and night, and ordering the Public Security Bureau to notify each household to dig the basements eight or nine feet deep, cover the top with two or three inches of thick wooden planks, and cover the planks with five or six feet of soil. The size of the basement is to be determined by oneself. In case of aircraft arrival, rush into the basement to avoid danger. After I finished talking with County Chief Gu, it was already dusk. I returned to the station. According to information from the station,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>At about 11:00 AM this morning, the Japanese side again sent forty planes from Shenyang. Four planes dropped bombs between Daling River and Dahushan, and thirty-six planes went to Tongliao County, destroying the Sidao Railway Station. How the losses are in these two places has not been confirmed. Upon hearing the news, I wanted to go to Tongliao for inspection, but the people at the station strongly advised me not to go, saying that there was no guarantee for the Datu Railway passenger train. So I took train No. 102 to Guan. I left Jin County at 8:00 PM. This train had a total of twenty-three passenger cars. The people fleeing the disaster at the station were shoulder to shoulder. There was no room to stand in the first and second class cars. The roof of the car was also full of people sitting. At 9:00 PM, we passed Gaoqiao. Because the train was overloaded, the axle caught fire. So we stopped to put it out. The passengers on the train had a disturbance. At 11:00 PM, one third-class car was bent due to the overcrowding of passengers, almost causing a derailment. So we stopped again to adjust. The passengers had another false alarm. The soldiers and police guarding the train also guarded the car door with live ammunition. When the train rolled back to Lianshan and stopped, and they inquired about the cause, the crowd was relieved. The locomotive also opened up full horsepower and rushed up the slope. This phenomenon is rarely seen on the Beining Railway. At 8:00 AM this morning, we passed Tangshan, and only arrived at Tianjin Station at 11:30 AM. (Written on the Beining Railway train on the 10th, sent from Tianjin).</p>
<h3>The Japanese Troops' Intention in Forcibly Occupying Liaoji</h3>
<p>The Purpose Is to Find New Opponents</p>
<p>To Complete the Jihui and Xinfa Railways</p>
<p>Binjiang Correspondence: The Japanese mobilized tens of thousands of troops and spent millions of yen in this dispatch of troops to the three northeastern provinces. Their purpose is certainly not to compete in a fit of pique, nor to permanently occupy Shenyang, Changchun, Zhengjiatun, Taonan and other places, but to use this to divide the political situation in the three northeastern provinces, find new opponents, and implement Tanaka Giichi's so-called "two ports and two railways" and undermine the so-called parallel railway policy on the Chinese side.</p>
<p>The so-called two ports are Dalian in Liaoning and Chongjin in Korea. The so-called two railways are the South Manchuria Railway and the Jihui Railway. The South Manchuria Railway is currently developing by leaps and bounds, and has the Anfeng Railway and Andong Port to assist it, but it is an isolated army in deep territory, unable to advance or retreat freely. In addition, since the Jihei-Datu two railways were built, business has inevitably been somewhat affected. Therefore, in the Japanese view, the Jihui Railway on the other route must be completed rapidly. After the completion of this railway, trains can travel around Jilin, Liaoning and Korea in a large circle, and the sea transportation connection can make Chongjin and Dalian connect to Japan, and the southern and western parts of Jilin Province and the eastern part of Liaoning Province will be in their pocket. The hope of completing the Jihui Railway has been accumulating for a long time. Fortunately, the authorities in the east province knew the magnitude of its danger, and ultimately did not allow it to fulfill its wishes. However, in the past few years, the Jidun Railway in the west has been completed, and the Tiantu Railway in the east has also been connected to Tianbaoshan. The only difference is a small section of 100 kilometers in the middle. This time, the Japanese army arrived in Yongji, and a new government was established in Jilin under its supervision. It also sent troops eastward to Dunhua, forcing construction on its own. In the future, even if the troops are withdrawn after completion, its plan for two ports and two railways will have been completed. The so-called four counties in Jiandao are safely in their pocket. At present, although there are not many Japanese troops stationed in Dunhua, there are more than 2,000 Japanese police, stationed soldiers, and veterans in the four counties of Yanbian, Hunchun, Hening and Qingyuan, all of whom are well-armed. All of them are set up to complete the Jihui Railway.</p>
<p>What's more, the Japanese people's slogan of the era of Songhua River before the dispatch of troops is also based on the completion of the Jihui Railway as the starting point. At present, the Japanese are not only promoting the implementation of the Jihui Railway, but also carrying out the route of the railway line from Yanji via Ningan (that is, Ningguta) to Hailin. It is planned that the line must pass through the banks of Jingpo Lake, along the Mudan River, via Ningguta, to Hailin Station in the eastern section of the Middle East Railway, or even extend northward to Yilan (that is, Sansing). If this road can be built, it will have great political and economic benefits. It is sufficient to cut off the eastern line of the Middle East Railway from going to Vladivostok. In peacetime, it can divide its freight and passenger transport. (It is found that the annual output of agricultural products in the eastern line of the East Railway reaches 500,000 tons, and the land is still largely undeveloped.) In the event of an emergency, it can touch the back of Vladivostok and stab the belly of Bo Li. As in the failure of the expedition to Siberia in 1920, it should not be seen again. In addition, there are many benefits that can be developed. They are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The water power of Jingpo Lake was investigated by the Japanese people two or three years ago. As a result of spending twenty or thirty thousand gold, it was proved that the water power of the lake can be used to generate electricity, which can be used in the three northeastern provinces and Korea. After that, Kan Zhaoxi went to investigate again and wanted to use it but failed. At present, Kan is under the influence of the Japanese in Shenyang and is one of the leaders of the Security Association.</p>
<p>(B) The irrigation of the Mudan River is the most suitable place for planting rice in the three northeastern provinces, and the same is true for the Maling River basin nearby. At present, there are more than 10,000 Koreans planting there. If there is a railway to Yanji, the 500,000 Koreans living in the area will gather like ants and become the second Jiandao.</p>
<p>(C) The coal in the Ningan area, the Muling coal is the giant of northern three northeastern provinces, but the Muling coal is only a part of the coal production area. There are still many seedlings produced in Ningan Yilan area. If it can be developed, it can block the passage of Muling coal to Harbin and the Hu Hai line.</p>
<p>(D) The benefits of forestry in the east province are now concentrated in Jilin Province, and concentrated in the Muling Ningan Hailin area. The so-called Hailin Timber Company, jointly operated by China and Japan, is operating well and its performance is not bad.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Japanese people are making every effort to survey the route between Hailin and Yanji. In the future, they may take the local government of Jilin or the so-called Northeast New Government as their opponent to obtain the construction rights of the road. (According to Japanese newspapers, the establishment of the Jilin Provisional Government is mostly referred to as an independent government, and its ambition to interfere in our country's internal affairs is clearly visible. We hope that the local virtuous people will not be fooled by it and will not be a second Li Wanyong.)</p>
<p>The above is the Japanese people's policy of advancing eastward and northward, and it has been seen in practice, or is being prepared for implementation. As for the policy of advancing westward and northward, what about it? Describe it as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese people claim that the Jihei, Shenhei, and Datu railways are parallel lines to the South Manchuria Railway. Therefore, this time, troops were sent to occupy Zhengjiatun (Tongliao) and Taonan, hitting its hub in an attempt to advance. The director of the Sidao Railway Bureau has been reappointed by the Japanese, and several trains carrying soldiers have been moved to Xinmin without the permission of the Beining Railway authorities, occupying the area. During the Russo-Japanese War between Shenyang and Xinmin, the Japanese people had already built a military railway, which was named the Xinfeng Railway. It was taken back by the Beining Railway Bureau from Japan in 1907 and the track was relaid. The money was paid off before 1927, but the Japanese people still never forget this section of railway, thinking that it is too cheap for the Chinese people. After the opening of the Datong Zhengtao roads, the southbound cargo is increasing day by day, and there is a trend of forming a Hulugang to compete with Dalian. Therefore, the Japanese people are trying to undermine the business of Datong Road and build another railway to run parallel to it and provide for the South Manchuria Railway, which is the old case of the Xinfa Railway. The so-called Xinfa Railway is the railway between Xinmin and Faku. In 1907, China planned to approve the British Pauling Company to build the railway. Its planned route was to reach Qiqihar northward. As a result, Japan strongly opposed it, saying that if the railway was built, it should end in Tieling or Changtu and could not run parallel to the South Manchuria Railway. Therefore, the discussion did not succeed. This time, the Japanese people occupied Zhengjiatun and Xinmin to cut off the connection between Datong and Zhengtao roads and disturb the traffic of the Beining Railway, which is what they hope for the Xinfa Railway. If the railway between Xinmin and Faku, or the railway between Faku and Zhengjiatun, is completed by the Japanese people or built with Japanese funds, then Datong Road will be equal to waste. If the section between Xinmin and Shenyang is again in the hands of the Japanese people, then the railway from Shenyang via Xinmin Zhengjiatun Taonan to Ang'angxi will be controlled by the Japanese people. (At present, the Sitao and Taoang roads have Japanese debt relations), and the so-called Dongmeng will be in their pocket. In the south, taking advantage of the convenience of the Liao River, they will take Yingkou and Goubangzi, and the Beining Railway cars will not be able to leave the customs, that is, the Middle East Railway will be divided into three sections and will be useless.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Jihui and Xinfa railways are the biggest purpose of this dispatch of troops by Japan. (The next is to ensure the rights of commercial leasing, etc.) Jihui has already been forcibly built, and Xinfa is also coveting it. Its method is that the old opponent is unwilling to promise and will seek it from the new opponent.</p>
<p>The Jilin government has been reorganized under its supervision and has obtained a new opponent. According to Japanese newspapers, the rest is also in progress, and they are vigorously advocating independence. For the current plan, the central government should urgently declare to China and foreign countries that all contracts established by public and private organizations or individuals in the three northeastern provinces after September 19 are invalid, which is enough to prevent future troubles.

<h3>Japanese Troops Forcefully Build Airfield in Jilin</h3>
<p>Jilin Communication: For the past few days, the people of Jilin have been extremely panicked, with numerous rumors circulating. One rumor claimed that Wang Yizhe, the first brigade commander from Fengtian, was leading a large contingent of officers and soldiers from Chaoyang Town, the connecting point between the Jilin-Hai and Shenyang-Hai lines, towards Jilin City, intending to engage in a decisive battle with the Japanese on the outskirts of Jilin City. However, it has been verified that Wang's brigade is currently concentrated on the Shenyang-Hai road near Beishan Chengzi, so there is no reason for them to advance towards Jilin City.  However, recently Japanese troops have been digging trenches along the Jilin-Changchun Railway station area and near Beixinkaimen. Japanese aircraft have also been conducting reconnaissance flights. At the same time, a large number of Chinese laborers were recruited at the cattle and horse market in the city. Many people suspected that these were recruits for the Chinese army, leading to rumors of imminent war in Jilin City. In reality, the Japanese are recruiting Chinese laborers to build an airfield. To facilitate the takeoff and landing of aircraft, the Japanese military is constructing an airfield at Yilagang, north of Lianhua Pao, with a five-day deadline for completion. They have already seized over ten *li* of farmland for this purpose. The project requires over a thousand workers daily, hence the vigorous recruitment of Chinese laborers to serve as coolies. The fact that the Japanese are building an airfield in the provincial capital clearly demonstrates their intention to occupy the area permanently.</p>
<p>As for the number of Japanese troops stationed in Jilin, most people are unaware, and even the Chinese authorities find it difficult to ascertain. According to investigations, the approximate locations of Japanese troops stationed in Jilin are as follows:</p>
<p>Brigade Headquarters: Dapo Adviser's Residence</p>
<p>30th Regiment Commander's Office</p>
<p>1st Battalion Commander's Office</p>
<p>1st Company Commander's Office</p>
<p>2nd Company Army Finance Training Institute</p>
<p>3rd Company and Machine Gun Company Commander's Office</p>
<p>16th Regiment: Nisshin Ryokan (Japanese-Qing Hotel)</p>
<p>2nd Battalion Public Office Commander's Residence</p>
<p>5th Company: Honda Residence</p>
<p>6th Company: Katsura Residence</p>
<p>7th Company: Maeda Residence</p>
<p>Machine Gun Teams 1, 2, 3</p>
<p>3rd Battalion: Akaike Residence</p>
<p>9th Company: Jinhua</p>
<p>10th Company: Kubota Residence</p>
<p>11th Company: Takuwawa Residence</p>
<p>Machine Gun Team: Matsue</p>
<p>Field Artillery Team: Minehata Residence</p>
<p>Cavalry Team: Kyoritsu Corporation</p>
<p>Garrison: Tsunemitsu Flour Mill Company</p>
<p>The above Japanese troops are all stationed in the provincial capital. The 8th Company of the 3rd Battalion, totaling over 230 officers and soldiers, stationed in the area of Dunhua County, led by Captain Natsumoto, departed from Dunhua for Jilin on the 5th of this month, along with seven Japanese households. (October 8)</p>
<h3>Central Government and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: At 9:00 AM on the 12th, the Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week event. Attendees included Central Committee members Yang Shuzhuang, Zhu Peide, Ding Weifen, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Cheng Tianfang, Kexing'e, Wang Boling, Zhang Daofan, Miao Peicheng, Fang Juehui, Yu Jingtang, and staff and guests, totaling over 600 people. Zhu Peide presided over the meeting, and Wu Tiecheng delivered a report, stating that Japan's policy of aggression and ambition to annex the Northeast has been carefully planned since the Russo-Japanese War. The three northeastern provinces have long been under Japanese control, and Japan has been gradually encroaching upon them using soft tactics. However, no one expected the recent incident to occur so quickly and violently. The reason for this is that Japan believes that the authorities in the Eastern Provinces are not listening to their commands. Zhang Hanqing's change of flags in the 17th year of the Republic and his entry into the customs last year to quell the internal unrest all showed his support for the Central Government, which was not what the Japanese had hoped for. Japan's policy of aggression can be summarized as "protection, occupation, and local protection." They not only want to maintain their vested interests but also want to expand their influence as much as possible. Therefore, they could not tolerate this and suddenly sent troops to occupy Shenyang on the 18th of last month. Zhang, who was in Beiping at the time, received the telegram and thought that the Japanese were just provoking him temporarily, so he ordered the army to retreat by telephone to avoid falling into their trap. It was not non-resistance. Recently, the situation has become increasingly serious. Although the League of Nations has resolved to order the Japanese troops to withdraw by the 14th, the Japanese troops not only did not withdraw but also sent aircraft to Jinzhou to bomb our temporary provincial government. They also sent troops to Tongliao to destroy railway tracks, expanding their acts of aggression daily. Now, the people across the country are indignant, and the people are unanimously requesting a declaration of war against Japan. However, a declaration of war cannot be made without preparation. Without unity within the party, unity across the country, and consistency of will, not only will we be unable to fight, but even the most effective means of economic sanctions will not be completely successful. In order to achieve the goal of revenge and retribution, we must, from this day forward, unite the entire party and the entire country, make the greatest determination, and put in our best effort to achieve it. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>National Government: At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held a memorial week for the late premier. Attendees included Chairman Jiang and ministers of various departments, including Yu Youren, Shao Yuanchong, Ma Fuxiang, Yang Shuzhuang, Kong Xiangxi, He Yaozu, Li Shuhua, Ru Yuli, and staff, totaling over 300 people. After Chairman Jiang led the ceremony, Kong Xiangxi reported on the issue of Japan. Subsequently, Chiang also gave a report. The speeches are being compiled.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Japan Forced to Leave the Country</h3>
<p>Japanese Police Indulge Koreans in Robbery</p>
<p>Osaka Communication: Recently, the oppression of overseas Chinese in Japan has been extremely cruel. Japanese authorities often use Koreans to carry out various intimidating tactics to drive out all overseas Chinese. On the 6th of this month, the two Chinese businesses, Zhongdong Company and Deshunhe Company, in Gifu Prefecture, with over 30 overseas Chinese, suddenly received warnings from the Japanese police, limiting them to leave the country immediately; otherwise, they could not guarantee the lives and property of the Chinese. Not a moment after the Japanese police left, over 300 Korean mobs swarmed in. The overseas Chinese were unable to avoid them and were mostly beaten and injured. Their property was looted by the Koreans. All overseas Chinese withdrew completely on the same day. Most Koreans are poor, and their daring to rob Chinese property is due to the indulgence of the Japanese, to drive out overseas Chinese. (October 7)</p>
<p>Local Communications</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Temporary Court Jointly Tries Communists: The temporary court, organized to try counter-revolutionary cases, brought Cao Shuming and Zhang XingSong, two criminals, to court for trial at 11:00 AM today (the 11th). Wu Qinghe, another criminal, could not be tried because the Higher Court had not yet issued the case files. According to Zhang XingSong's confession, he did receive orders from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to be the secretary of a district's second branch and to recruit three people into the party. However, he was unwilling to comply, and the Communist Party hated him and regarded him as a traitor. On the other hand, the Kuomintang also regarded him as a counter-revolutionary communist. But in reality, he was a law-abiding citizen and requested to be acquitted. Cao Shuming also stated that he was not the commander of the Fifth Detachment of the Communist Party and had not committed robbery and murder. He could summon witnesses for questioning. Finally, he requested to be transferred to the detention center because he could not bear the abuse in prison. If he could be transferred, he would be willing to expose all the inhumane and dark conditions in prison as much as possible. However, the judge did not approve it. After Cao and Zhang finished their confessions, the three judges consulted and returned the two criminals to custody. Cao Shuming was allowed to summon witnesses for questioning, and the case will be reviewed again. Zhang XingSong will be sentenced in seven days.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Kidnapping Case Solved in Shanghai: On the 9th of this month, a motorboat suddenly arrived at Caicun Village, Xiangcheng Township, carrying over ten bandits. They kidnapped Wang Tongsheng, the 12-year-old son of farmer Wang Yangshan, and took him to the boat, heading towards the Wusong Port area. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 12th), the bandits took the hostage to Shanghai. At the North Railway Station, the hostage suddenly cried and screamed "robbers". The police stationed at the station went forward to question them and learned the whole story. They arrested two bandits on the spot and took them to the Public Security Bureau. They then sent someone to Suzhou to report to the Wu County Public Security Bureau, which immediately sent personnel to Shanghai that night to bring them back to Suzhou for interrogation.</p>
<p>The Case of Murdering One's Husband Remains a Death Sentence: In the case where Wang Jin, a resident of Hengjingdu Village, conspired with her lover, Shi Lansheng, to murder her husband, Wang Renfa, Wang Jin was sentenced to death by the Wu County District Court after being arrested. Shi Lansheng will be sentenced after he is apprehended. Wang Jin was dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court. Yesterday (the 12th), the second trial verdict was still a death sentence.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>The Truth About the Bloody Tragedy in the Tenth District of Changshu: At 11:00 AM on the 9th of this month, farmers from the Tenth District went to the district office to petition. A bloody tragedy occurred at Diandang Bridge, resulting in two deaths at the time, one death later, and three injuries. All executive and supervisory committee members of the district party headquarters, considering the matter involved human lives, personally went to the scene of the incident at 1:00 PM on the 10th to conduct a detailed investigation. The truth is recorded as follows: The Tenth District is close to the riverbank and was originally the Gaoping District. Farmers there mainly grow cotton. This year, the summer and autumn winds, rain, and tides caused disasters, and the autumn harvest was hopeless. The farmers had previously jointly petitioned the district office to reduce and exempt rents. After District Chief Wang Hongyu's persuasion, the matter had been resolved peacefully. However, for some unknown reason, District Chief Wang suddenly secretly ordered the district defense corps and other armed soldiers around 10:00 PM on the 8th of this month, led by Township Chief Ma Junqin, Xia Shangqing, and Township Guard Zhou Tang, to arrest the leaders and followers of the petition in Changshou Township and other places. However, that area is close to Luhua Town on the border of Tai, and that town has been repeatedly plagued by theft, leading to misunderstandings. Residents mistakenly thought that bandits had arrived, and residents fled one after another, with some drowning while wading across the water. By the time the truth was known, they had already suffered considerable fright. The next day (the 9th), residents of that town and the surrounding areas went to the district office to request that people not be arrested at night to avoid misunderstandings and to request that the township chiefs lead the way. Unexpectedly, the township chiefs arrived at the district office first and reported the matter lightly, and the district chief immediately ordered the district defense corps and the stationed armed groups to rush to the west bank of Diandang Bridge (about one li from the district office) to guard it. When the farmers arrived at the east bank of Diandang Bridge and saw armed police guarding the opposite bank, they thought that going to the district office to petition was a legitimate matter and that nothing unexpected would happen. Unexpectedly, before they crossed the bridge, they suddenly heard gunshots. They were terrified and turned to flee, but six people fell to the ground after being shot. The district office and the police, seeing that they had caused trouble, immediately threw a rifle, a pistol, and two bayonets into the river at Diandang Bridge. They also arrested seven farmers—Zhu Dadi, Jin Chao, Yang Amao, Xu Xingdu, Zhu Quan, Hu Zu, and Wang Xiang—who had been drinking tea in a tea shop west of the bridge before the police arrived at Diandang Bridge. They beat them all the way, and Zhu Dadi was struck so hard that his shoulder blade was broken. They were then taken to the defense corps, where, except for Zhu Quan, who was 62 years old and did not suffer physical pain due to his age, the rest were brutally beaten with green bamboo poles. Two people died on the spot: Chen Quanfu, 27 years old, from Changyou Shore; Zhu Lin, 16 years old, from Changshou Temple. Zhu Tong, 23 years old, from Yangjiawan, died after being shot. Three people were shot but did not die: Sun Yiyun, Mr. He, Wang Lu, 50 years old, from Wutu. At the time of the investigation, the dead were still lying on the east bank of Diandang Bridge, and the injured had been sent to the city for treatment by the district office.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association Reorganized Under Orders: The Wuxi All-Circles Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association was reorganized under the order of the provincial party headquarters and held a reorganization meeting on the afternoon of the 11th. The important matters resolved were: (1) It was decided to have five standing committee members. Zhao Zixin, Xie Bin, Ji Pu, Wei Zhiwen, and Hu Nianqian were elected as standing committee members. (2) Japanese goods stored in various businesses and stores that were sealed and registered last time had not been completely eliminated. It was decided to extend the deadline to re-register by the 16th and seal them all in the Chamber of Commerce pending resolution. (3) The investigation of Japanese goods stored in stores was temporarily suspended before the 16th. However, the work of checking transportation locations should be intensified day and night. (4) Goods that were mistakenly seized previously and have been identified as non-Japanese goods should be returned immediately. (5) Li Tiping was appointed as secretary, and Wang Ciqing was appointed as head of the inspection department.</p>
<p>The Merchant Corps in the Midst of National Crisis: Yang Hanxi, the president of the local Merchant Corps Association, yesterday ordered the corps members to practice diligently. All uniforms should be changed to domestic yellow cloth to promote domestic goods. It was also heard that President Yang periodically draws some corps members from the rural areas and corps members from the urban areas for a gathering and training to earnestly assist the military and police in maintaining local order.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Japanese Warships Pass Through, Opening Machine Guns as a Show of Force: Since the Japanese military invaded our Northeast, Jiangyin, located in the center of the Yangtze River, has seen Japanese warships traveling up and down the Yangtze River every day, passing through our county's river without stopping. Unexpectedly, at around 10:00 AM on the 8th, a Japanese warship sailed from Shanghai, passing through the Jiangmian section of Shazhou West Wujie. Seeing many farmers building dikes on the shore, it suspected them to be troops and opened fire with machine guns for seventy or eighty rounds, intentionally provoking them. Seeing no movement on the shore, it sailed to the vicinity of Changshan and anchored, shining searchlights very close to the Huangshan Fortress. It was not until dawn that it went upstream. It was heard that the warship was the No. 24 destroyer. On the 9th, the Public Security Bureau verified the facts through a telephone call from Wujie Bridge and reported it to the county government for handling.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Seizes Japanese Goods: On the 9th, the Japanese goods inspectors of the Nanqing Anti-Japanese Association seized forty packages of unbranded Japanese yarn at the Dada Company Wharf outside the North Gate. Because there was no trademark on the packages, they were detained. Later, staff from the Tongfengshun Cloth Factory outside the East Gate claimed that it was Chinese yarn and took out the Golden Treasure Star trademark from the bag. The inspectors suspected the yarn and sent it to the Anti-Japanese Association of the County Party Headquarters for review.</p>
<h3>Liuhe</h3>
<p>Dispute Over Confiscated and Released Rice Boats Unresolved: A large number of rice boats leaving Jiangpu have recently been stopped by disaster victims from Pukou and Liuhe counties. Later, an order was received from the province to release them. Magistrate Hong of Liuhe ordered Zhangjiabao grain boats to comply with the order. After much persuasion, the disaster victims agreed to release them. However, during the persuasion and mediation, in addition to Magistrate Hong, Dong Fufen, the district chief of the Fifth District, and local notable Zhang Zuoquan, also accompanied Magistrate Hong to Pukou. The grain merchants and boatmen detained Zhang Zuoquan and Dong Fufen, and they have been held for many days. The telegram that Magistrate Hong sent to the Civil Affairs Department is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Received your telegram. I followed the Party Committee to Zhangjiabao, verified that the grain boats arriving in Jiangri from Lai'an and the incident where County Chief Dong invited Qiu Kan of the Finance and Agriculture Departments and Committees Jin and Zhang to the scene to guide and escort the grain boats to Pukou are two separate matters. I immediately ordered the 250 grain boats arriving in Jiangri to depart immediately and escorted them out of the county. The boatmen insisted that they would not depart until the boats detained in Lai'an arrived. Later, after Commissioners Lu and Chen persuaded them without success, they gathered a crowd and surrounded the county magistrate, demanding the release of the people arrested in Lai'an, creating a menacing situation. Fortunately, after Commissioners Lu and Chen earnestly persuaded them, I managed to escape safely. I will submit a separate document detailing the situation. Respectfully reported."</p>
<p>Also, the district chiefs of each district sent a telegram to Hu, the head of the Civil Affairs Department in Zhenjiang: "Magistrate Hong took District Chief Chuanfen to Pukou to release the boats but was detained by Magistrate Xia for many days. Public officials are all in danger. Please investigate and deal with it."</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Schools Form Volunteer Armies One After Another: In Huaian and Huaiyin provinces, as well as the Provincial Huaiyin Agricultural School, the Japanese have been so tyrannical that armed resistance is necessary.

They have specially requested Commander Liang of the 25th Route Army to borrow guns and ammunition and to have Gao, a senior officer from the General Headquarters, teach them live-fire shooting. Commander Liang has dispatched Li Guozhen, the chief of the ordnance department, to contact the teachers and students of the two schools separately.</p>

<p>Declaration Warning the Japanese Military: Since the Japanese imperialists sent troops to the Eastern Provinces to trample on our country's soil and oppress our people, they have continued to send warships to oversee the Yangtze River basin. Their sinister intentions and perverse actions are hated by people all over the world and not only by the people of our country. Since the sound of cannons in Shenyang, our government has been reluctant to send troops easily to defend against them and break the treaty in order to maintain world peace, adhering to international law, so it has endured again and again to maintain the peace of East Asia. However, the tyrannical Japanese military dares to disregard public opinion and is constantly advancing, defying the great injustice of the world. The right and wrong have been clearly revealed before the eyes of people all over the world. Since the opening of the League of Nations in Geneva, with a fair attitude and reasonable demands, it has unanimously urged Japan to withdraw its troops quickly to maintain world peace and has set a deadline for all troops to withdraw from the country before October 14 to avoid further conflicts. Our government is abiding by the world's ruling, waiting quietly for the Japanese side to withdraw its troops, and will not negotiate for the time being. However, Japan is forcibly occupying and refusing to withdraw in the slightest. Recently, it has even ordered fleets to enter Shanghai, intending to provoke and prolong the situation in order to achieve its wolfish ambitions. It must be known that the youth of China still exist, with youthful vigor. Even we, the students of the entire city, can put the dwarf bandits to death. All of us, the students of the entire city, swear to 指日爲誓,臥薪嘗膽. If the Japanese soldiers do not withdraw for a day, the anti-Japanese movement will not stop for a day. At this critical moment of national survival, we should rush to fire and water, bravely sacrifice ourselves, without the slightest retreat, to avenge this national humiliation and uphold justice. This is our declaration. Shanghai Secondary School Students Anti-Japanese National Salvation Union.</p>
<h3>After Representatives of Students Studying in Japan Return to China</h3>
<p>Contacting Accommodation···Preparing to Petition in Beijing</p>
<p>The Chinese Students Association in Japan sent twenty representatives, including Qu Xianglin and Sun Pu, back to China. They arrived in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru the day before yesterday and are temporarily staying at the Ping An Hotel. It is learned that the representatives have limited travel expenses, so it is difficult for them to stay in hotels for a long time. Therefore, the first step of their work after arriving in Shanghai is to contact various parties for accommodation and then prepare to go to Beijing to petition the National Government to assist the remaining students studying in Japan to return to China. At 2:00 PM yesterday, when the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Union of various universities held a representative meeting, the delegation sent four representatives to report on their return to China and request assistance in finding accommodation. After the anti-Japanese representatives of various schools resolved to have the Executive Committee handle it, there was still no concrete solution for the time being. According to Mr. Sun Pu of the returned delegation, there will be a large number of privately funded students studying in Japan returning to China on the 15th.</p>
<h3>County Education Bureau Affairs Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau held its 220th bureau affairs meeting yesterday. Attendees included Director Shi, Supervisor Zhu, Zheng Guozhai, Lin Weiwen, Niu Zhiyi, Yan Zhongguang, Qian Zhonghou, Wang Chengxin, and Xi Siwu. Director Shi presided, and Pan Sheng-san recorded. The proceedings followed proper etiquette. The report items are omitted. Discussion items: (1) Regarding the Tangwan People's Education Center's request for an appropriation of start-up funds. It was resolved that, having previously reported that the fundraising for the center's preparations was entirely due to donations, and now claiming financial difficulties, the director of the center should, together with the preparation director Peng Zhaotang, submit a report of the preparation completion accounts to the bureau first. Meanwhile, the bureau will strive to provide a subsidy of eighty yuan to assist. (2) Omitted. (3) Nomination of members for the bureau's financial audit committee. It was resolved to nominate Mr. Yang Huiming as a member of the current committee.</p>
<h3>Lao Da's Zhang Yuanruo Speaks on National Salvation Policies</h3>
<p>The Labor University's Academy of Social Sciences held a memorial week yesterday. President Zhang presided and spoke on national salvation and resistance against Japan policies, explaining the basic points of national salvation and resistance and pointing out the root causes of problems in mass movements. The gist of the speech was that the key to national survival lies in culture. The modern world has a dazzling phenomenon: those who adapt will live, and those who resist will perish. This phenomenon is the development of scientific culture. The reason why Japan is strong and we are weak lies in this. Therefore, in the future, China must restore the inherent ability of the Chinese nation to create culture and strive for the creation of scientific culture as the foundation for developing all national strength. It is also necessary to permanently resist the aggressive and hegemonic culture of the enemy. Slogans and banners are merely superficial and not the work itself. A major error of mass movements is mistaking the superficial for the actual and the means for the ends, ultimately leading to external strength and internal weakness, making success impossible. Finally, there was also a discussion about Liang Shuming's thoughts on resisting Japan. The lecture was passionate and solemn, and the manuscript is planned to be organized and published.</p>
<h3>Universities in Northern Shanghai Hold Classes as Usual</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Federation of University Students held a representative conference of various schools at the Youth Propaganda Corps at 1 p.m. yesterday. Representatives from universities such as Jinan University, the College of Political Science and Law, and Zhizhi College spoke to a Shanghai News reporter, stating that classes were being held as usual at each school every day. Those few students who had left school had been urged to return to school as soon as possible by the student union of each school, and military training was being intensified without the slightest slackening.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Continues in Various Schools</h3>
<p>The propaganda department of the Guanghua Anti-Japanese Association of Guanghua University students is working extremely hard with disguised propaganda. In addition to hiring famous figures such as Li Shicen, Wang Zaoshi, and He Bingsong to give lectures at the school at any time, they also sent teams to propagate along the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Road. Recently, due to the rise of rumors in Shanghai, causing unrest among the people, which is actually a tactic of the Japanese to undermine our patriotic movement, they are deeply concerned that our compatriots will fall for their poisonous plan. Therefore, on the Double Tenth Festival, they specially dispatched multiple teams of propaganda members disguised as lecturers in the Ximen and Zhabei areas, hoping to awaken the public and prevent them from being softened by the threats of the Japanese invaders.</p>
<p>Hujiang University's Reading and National Salvation Go Hand in Hand. At this time of national crisis, all young students at Shanghai Hujiang University should have the spirit of enduring hardship and making great efforts to study and strengthen their abilities for a long-term struggle. Because of the many rumors circulating recently, there is deep concern that the parents of students are worried about their children. Yesterday, President Liu sent a letter to the parents of the students, offering comfort and explanations with extreme sincerity. Middle School Students in Shanghai Go to the Countryside to Propagate. Since the organization of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association at the Provincial Shanghai Middle School in Nanshi, this municipality, the work has been very intense. Every day at 6 a.m., all teachers and students gather on the playground to practice military training. Propaganda work has been uninterrupted in this municipality. It is reported that this week, the propaganda department plans to divide classes and go to various counties in the Shanghai maritime circuit, such as Jinshan, Fengxian, Chuansha, Qingpu, and Jiading, to propagate in the countryside.</p>
<p>Patriotic Songs Given Away. Xu Sanming, the Dean of Studies at Dunren Girls' School, has recently compiled patriotic songs to increase the courage and determination of patriots. After the first song, "Kill the Enemy," was printed and given away, more than a hundred requests were received from people across the country every day. The thousand copies that were printed were quickly exhausted. The second song, "For Compatriots, For National Defense," has already been printed and prepared for distribution.</p>
<p>Qinghua Middle School Organizes a Lecture Team. The school has always been extremely enthusiastic about patriotic movements. When the Northeast was violently occupied by Japan, the teachers and students of the school organized an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, which was formally established the day before yesterday. Seventeen members, including Chen Shenghe and Feng Shuhua, were elected as executive and supervisory committee members to actively work. Yesterday, a lecture team was organized.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Troop Recruitment News</h3>

<h3>A Farewell Performance The Malayan Football Team Heavily Defeats Jinan</h3>
<p>| Three to Zero Ratio | Departed Shanghai This Morning to Return South |</p>
<p>| Ticket Sales for Disaster Relief | Rescuing Countless Victims |</p>
<p>The Malayan Overseas Chinese Football Team played a farewell match against the Jinan University Football Team at the China Baseball Field yesterday. The Malayans, with their strong defense and sharp forwards, defeated Jinan 3-0. In the three matches in Shanghai, they won two and drew one. The entire team is scheduled to return south in triumph at 9 a.m. this morning aboard the Empress of Russia. The ticket sales for all three matches played by the Malayans were used for disaster relief. Millions of victims should be offering prayers and seeing them off from afar.</p>

<h3>Even Better Performance</h3>
<p>The Malayans' second performance was praised by the audience. Yesterday's match was even more perfect. The so-called weakness of the defense and shortcomings of the goalkeeper were swept away. Lin Tiancan's goalkeeping was steady and commendable, and he caught many powerful shots. The two defenders also defended tightly without losing the ball, especially the right defender Chen Yushu. The central defense line closely monitored the two Jinan forwards, Dai and Chen, which was also a major reason why Jinan returned empty-handed. The smooth connection of the five forwards and the magic of passing were beyond description.</p>
<h3>Jinan Is No Match</h3>
<p>It cannot be said that Jinan is not strong, but the defenders, facing the machine-like fast movements of the Malayan forwards attacking from the left and right, found it difficult to cope and were often in a daze. Goalkeeper Wen Dingxiang was a new arrangement for Jinan and cannot be said to be bad, but he could not avoid blame for the loss of the first goal. The forwards lost much of their activity due to the strength of the Malayan defense. Yang Baomiao's substitution in the second half seemed weak. Overall, it was clear that Jinan was no match for the Malayans.</p>
<h3>Opening Goal</h3>
<p>Less than three minutes after the start, Jinan conceded a goal to the Malayans. Initially, the Malayans kicked off, and Luo Haiguang and Liu Zukan got the ball, advancing from the left in rapid succession, charging in front of the goal, and kicking over the bar without scoring. The Malayans launched a major counterattack, and the Jinan goal was surrounded. The ball flew in front of the goal, and Wen Dingxin, seeing the dangerous situation, jumped out to parry it, and the goal was wide open. The Malayan central forward was behind and kicked it directly into the goal.</p>
<h3>Fierce Counterattack</h3>
<p>Both sides were very active. Malayan Guan Xinde hooked the ball in the Jinan area, which was very beautiful. Feng Yunyou intercepted it and sent it far away, and Dai Linjing countered with a kick back into the Malayan area. Liu Zukan kicked a corner kick, and Mei Hongbao received it on the right, but did not score, much to the regret of the crowd. At that time, Jinan's attack was very fierce.</p>
<h3>Second Goal</h3>
<p>Since Jinan failed to score, the Malayans gained momentum instead. Li Wenjie sent a long ball to the right, Chen Mei'an received it and picked it up, Liang Qirui jumped up and headed it towards the goal, Wen Dingxin hurriedly caught it and kicked it forward, but it bounced off his body in front of the goal, almost conceding. The situation was precarious. Then Chen Mei'an advanced again on the right and passed it far to the left, Li Wenjie flew diagonally in, Zhuang Shihong kicked it out, Deng Yuehan rushed up and kicked it, and Guan Xinde shot a long shot with force, scoring the goal. The Malayans won again with a score of 2-0. After that, the two sides went back and forth, and Jinan bravely counterattacked, but stopped at the goal every time. Many corner kicks were also ineffective. The first half ended like this.</p>
<h3>Linjing's Three Kicks</h3>
<p>In the second half, the lineups of both sides changed. The Malayans moved to a position with a tailwind. Jinan kicked off and launched a fierce attack, but failed to achieve their goal. Dai Linjing then lifted his powerful foot twice at the penalty line and shot at the enemy goal from afar, making a loud bang like cannons. Once, it was caught by Lin, and once, it went out to the left by a few inches, which was a pity. Later, he launched another long-range attack, also missing by a few inches. Although he did not score, his shooting method was beautiful and powerful, and the whole stadium praised him, worthy of being a center forward. As the saying goes, "Although he didn't hit, he wasn't far off."</p>
<h3>Single-Handed Break Through</h3>
<p>Halfway through the second half, neither side had scored. Suddenly, Malayan center forward Xu Yongyuan got the ball alone and broke through the gate single-handedly. Zhuang Shihong was unable to stop him, and Jiang Shanjing was far away on the right side of the goal. By the time Jiang rushed over, Xu had already charged into the goal. The Malayans succeeded for the third time.</p>
<p>Cai's position was not within the shooting angle, so it was not counted as offside. The whole game ended with this score of 3-0.</p>
<h3>See You Next Year</h3>
<p>The entire Malayan team has been scheduled to return south this morning aboard the Empress of Russia. Although they are gone, their superb skills have been deeply imprinted in the minds of the people of Shanghai. The date of our reunion will be at the National Games in May next year. On the occasion of parting, we sincerely wish them a smooth journey, soaring straight up, and making further progress on the hundred-foot pole. Goodbye, goodbye.</p>
<h3>Results of Three Matches</h3>
<p>First match: Malayan wins against Western Police, 5-4</p>
<p>Second match: Malayan draws with Chinese Union, 4-4</p>
<p>Third match: Malayan wins against Jinan, 3-0</p>
<h3>Ticket Sales Report</h3>
<p>Yesterday's charity football ticket sales totaled 357 one-yuan tickets and 3,004 six-dime tickets.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Heartbreaking Words</h3>
<p>— Du Juan</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, the violence of the Japanese devils oppresses us in every way possible. We swallow our teeth when they are knocked out and endure with all our might. We are truly close to the point of unbearable endurance. But since we currently have no concrete means of responding, we can only continue to endure with resentment, while all 400 million of us should each keep an account. Start with the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 and record everything up to the May 9th Incident, the Jinan Incident, the Wanbaoshan Incident, and the recent events in the Eastern Provinces. In addition to these major debts, there are other small debts, which should also be recorded together. Let our hearts be the account book, and write in our hot blood. Let's see how long they rampage. We will eventually rise up and settle this debt with our blood and flesh.</p>
<p>Mr. Bu Chutingcaozhai's Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Old Wang</h3>
<p>This spring, when I was walking near Kunshan Garden, I heard a loud voice: "Two mao!"</p>
<p>I walked closer and saw that it was a foreign sailor riding in a rickshaw. It was clear that he had said two mao, but the sailor only gave one mao. The rickshaw puller was not satisfied, so he asked him to pay the rest. The sailor wanted to leave, but the rickshaw puller held on to him. The sailor turned around and slapped the rickshaw puller. The other rickshaw pullers and pedestrians were indignant and shouted in unison, "Hit him!" The rickshaw puller said, "It's not heroic for many people to hit one. Let me take him on alone." As soon as he said that, he threw a punch, and the sailor fell to the ground. He got up and returned the punch, but missed and was kicked to the ground by the rickshaw puller. The sailor knew that he was no match and sat on the ground. The rickshaw puller said, "Two mao!" The sailor had no choice but to give him a two-dime coin, took back the one-dime coin, and walked away dejectedly, not knowing where he was going. I asked the rickshaw puller his name, and he said it was "Old Wang." I gave him a thumbs up and paid my respects, saying, "You are worthy of being the king of rickshaw pullers." Old Wang! Old Wang! From the time the Japanese soldiers occupied Shenyang until now, there has not been a day that I have not missed you!</p>
<h3>Luo Yang, Qiu Lishi</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Luo Yang was the head of Baoshan Town. Lishi's surname was Qiu, but his given name has been lost to history. He was a local man. Even as a child, he had courage and knowledge. When he grew up, he was nine feet tall and extremely fat, unlike ordinary people. Therefore, people called him General. Qiu was also self-confident, saying, "I am not naturally gifted, so how dare I accept that title? But compared to those who wear tall hats and hold large seals of office but cannot defend the region to protect my common people, I am slightly better." During the Jiajing period, Japanese pirates invaded the seacoast, and Luo Yang was at the forefront. One day, pirates drove straight in from Maqiao, and under the flashing of swords, thousands of men and women were spared. Wherever the pirates went, the grass was barren and the rivers were filled with corpses, unable to flow. Qiu saw those who had not died running wildly without a place to go, and the pirates would soon sharpen their blades on them. So he returned home to get his spear, dragged it out, and shouted angrily, "Kill the bandits! Kill the bandits!" His wife did not know what he was doing and said, "Are you acting crazy again?" Qiu ignored her and ran like the wind, heading straight for the high ground of Nantang. He raised his spear and howled loudly. The crowd fleeing from the bandits heard his voice and cried out for help. Qiu said, "Don't be afraid. I am here. You can walk slowly." Before long, the pirates swarmed in, hacking at people's necks, the sound shaking the neighborhood. But Qiu stood down and used his spear to disrupt their momentum, shouting loudly. The pirates retreated several miles. At first, from Yueman to here, the pirates were as if they had entered an uninhabited place. When they met Qiu, their advance was slightly thwarted. Later, the pirates returned, brandishing long swords to fight with Qiu. The spear pierced his chest and out his back, and he fell to the ground. The others could not advance. Qiu had a friend named Ma Qianjin, who was also a brave man. Hearing the alarm, he grabbed a club and came to help Qiu. His spirit was even stronger. They advanced straight ahead, killing the bandits they encountered. The pirates who arrived later were terrified. So they gathered and formed a battle formation. Qiu's heart was not discouraged, but his strength was slightly tired. Seeing this, he stamped his feet and wept, saying to Qianjin, "You should avoid them. The bandits have arrived. We two cannot stop them. I am heavy and cannot walk. I will fight the bandits to the death. It is the same death anyway. Death is enough to thank the people of Luo. You can come and collect my bones later." Qianjin also wept uncontrollably, unwilling to leave. Qiu sighed and said, "Go! If you delay, you will die with me. What about the lack of a rearguard?" As soon as he finished speaking, the bandits had surrounded him three times. Qiu shouted and cursed while killing, and even stabbed their chieftain, killing more than ten of their leaders. Unfortunately, his spear suddenly broke, and the bandits took advantage of the situation, chopping off Qiu's ankles, so he could not stand. He sat on the ground, crippled. After a long time, he was dismembered by the bandits, cut into pieces. Qianjin came, cried loudly, dug a pit and buried him, and mourned, saying, "I did not leave, I should have helped. I have let you down. My intestines are broken. My heart is broken." He returned to manage his family, and then left. Alas, a man like Lishi could not bear the lives of thousands of people being taken by the bandits' knives, and was willing to sacrifice himself. Even if he is worshipped with incense and offerings for thousands of years, he would have no shame. But his name and family line are untraceable, perhaps it was the fault of the writers of that time, so I have supplemented it.</p>
<h3>A Little Bit of Common Knowledge in the Anti-Japanese Voice</h3>
<p>— Shou Man</p>
<p>Recently, in the anti-Japanese declarations and telegrams of the Chinese people, Japanese people are often referred to as "Wonu" and "Dwarves." Most readers know that these are aliases for the Japanese, but do not know the meaning of these names. I will explain them below, not to show off, but because this is also a knowledge that the Chinese people should have.</p>
<p>During the Yuan Dynasty, Japan was called "Wonu Country," because the main ethnic group was the "Great Wa" tribe. Therefore, Japanese people are now called "Wonu."</p>
<p>"Dwarves" refers to the ancient hairy people who were mostly hairy and lived in Hokkaido and Sakhalin Island. Therefore, Japanese people are also called "Dwarves."</p>
<p>During the Tang Dynasty, many people in Daozhou were pygmies, less than three feet tall, and were called "Dwarves." Today, the bodies of the Japanese are mostly short, so the name "Dwarves" is actually a clever pun.</p>
<h3>Wonderful Essay in the Voice of Lin Bai's Visit to China</h3>
<p>— Cailiang</p>
<p>Recently, the American aviator Colonel Lin Bai came to China. The newspapers have already detailed the matter. Recently, I heard that he volunteered to fly to various disaster areas in our country for inspection and take photos for use in raising funds for disaster relief when he returns to his country. His ancient and warm heart is deeply admired. My friend Mr. Yang, who has always been proficient in calligraphy, recently sent me his recent work, "Wishing Mr. Lin Bai Success in Flying Around the World," The words and sentences are elegant and worthy of recitation. I think the article is quite enough to enhance the friendly relations between China and the United States, so I write it as follows. I think it will also be welcomed by readers. There is a thing that is as agile as a swimming dragon. The machine hums and the time passes quickly. It ascends to the blue sky, directly approaching the vast sky. The flashing shadow is like lightning, and the wings flutter like wind. Guli is lost, and Lin Bai's achievements are celebrated. Floating in the sky, surveying the eight directions. Exhausting the universe in an instant, glancing around and feeling heroic. The vast sea is just a grain of rice, and the mountains are crossed in myriad layers. Mixing China and foreign countries without obstruction, and walking on dangerous and easy paths are all the same. The skill is as ingenious as Qigong, and the craftsmanship surpasses Gongshuzi. I am ignorant and dare to ask you, sir: You said that this is high but not dangerous. Is the secret of the wonderful machine subtle? Is the pole rising day by day, ultimately different from the mundane? Is it floating, transforming into a fairy, and breaking out of the siege of the red dust? Like a roc carrying darkness, like a bird soaring. Looking up at the stars and constellations, looking down at the country's affairs. This is what is called Lin Bai's plane.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Spring Colors of the Song Stage</h3>
<p>— Sheng Han</p>
<p>The long-rumored movie "Spring Colors of the Song Stage" was test-screened at the Guanglu Theater at 10 a.m. on the 7th. I drove there at 9 a.m. When I arrived, the seats were almost full. I sat down for about ten minutes, and then the movie started. The film uses synchronized sound, and the sound is exceptionally clear, far from what can be compared to wax record dubbing. After watching it, I returned home and wrote this miscellaneous record.</p>
<p>The script of the film is adapted from the novel "Woman, Woman" by Yao Sufeng of the Rotary Club of this newspaper. A scene of a charity performance for flood relief is inserted into the play, which some people think is close to an extra detail. But I do not know that the key to the whole play is Xiao Rong's visit to Suzhou with Hui Fang, and Hui Fang's motivation for visiting Suzhou was caused by a conversation with her girlfriend during a break in the entertainment meeting. I heard Mr. Li, the director of the company, say that this scene was originally a Kao Erfu stadium. Later, the company changed it to a charity performance because it saw the importance of publicizing flood relief.</p>
<p>The songs in the play, in addition to Xuan Jinglin's "Joy of Youth," "Good Jiangnan," and "Tonghua Feng," include Yang Naimei's "Cold Night Song," Xu Qinfang's "Fragrant Grass Beauty Song," Wu Suxin's "Su San's Uprising," Pu Jinghong's "Dance Partner's Song," and Violet's "Violet Dance." Beautiful dances and clear songs, which could not be shown on the silver screen in the past, can now be fully expressed with sound and image.</p>
<p>Pu Jinghong has changed from the queen of song and dance to the film industry. Although it is her first time on camera, she is lively and agile, and her performance is excellent. It is a pity that she burned herself with rubbing alcohol due to improper perming, and died. If heaven had given her more years, her future achievements would have been immeasurable.</p>
<p>The performance of Xuan Jinglin, who plays the singer Li Huifang, is the best. Xuan is good at playing this kind of character. The play is happy at first and then sad. She acts</p>
<h3>Becoming the First, Patriotic Mother (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Hu Yan Hong</p>
<p>Son. Your bravery has given me unparalleled pride and joy. Indeed.</p>
<p>I took your letter to declare to those who are mothers. Tears flowed down my face. But these tears were of pride. Of joy. Of course, also of sorrow.</p>
<p>Originally, a young person does not belong solely to his parents or family. A large part of him should belong to society, to the nation, to all of humanity. You should remember. When Japan forced China to sign the Twenty-One Demands, even though you were only six years old, I encouraged you and warned you, "You must not hope to die at home, in bed. You must die on the battlefield. You must die without a burial place, for the sake of your motherland." Now, this opportunity has arrived. Go forward. For the sake of your motherland. Otherwise, why would the country need cowardly young men? Why would mothers want disloyal and unloving sons?</p>
<p>Your actions are not just patriotic, but also fighting for the justice of all mankind. I hope that you and other young people will save the motherland from danger, and wrest back the so-called justice of the world and humanity from the hands of violent and cruel Japanese.</p>
<p>Yes, son. I admire you. I am willing to be the first mother in China who loves her country more than her son. I wish all mothers in China would do the same.</p>
<p>China will not perish. Justice will be served. Humanity will have peace. For these three things, I salute you for the nation and will forever encourage you.</p>
<p>Be brave. Go forward. I am praying for you.</p>
<p>Come at the right moment. Others like Pu Jinghong, Zhang Zhenduo, Zi Luolan, Xiao Zhengzhong, Wu Suxin, Yang Naimei, Qin Haha, Zhang Yongcui, etc., are all competent. However, Chen Yitang, who plays Zhang Xiaorong, and a certain person who plays Zhang's mother, seem a bit unnatural in their movements. This film has two major characteristics. One is the accuracy and clarity of the pronunciation. Even the best imported sound films cannot surpass it. The other is the grand gathering of female stars. There are as many as fifteen movie stars and singing stars in the film. With these dazzling stars, the spring scenery of the singing arena becomes even more splendid.</p>
<p>Rotary Club's Storytelling</p>
<h3>The Pestle Knocking on Dreams (11)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>Tao Chi's cries attracted the attention of the Military Governor's wife. Through the curtain, she questioned the kneeling young man:</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>"Scholar Tao Chi."</p>
<p>"Why are you crying for help?"</p>
<p>"I am a scholar who was left out of the examination. The examination hall is about to close its doors. Therefore, I prostrate myself and beg you to forward my petition to the Educational Commissioner so that I may be included in the examination."</p>
<p>"You don't need to kneel. Please stand up."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>In that "Yes," Mrs. Tang had already seen that this young man was a handsome and refined scholar, so she accepted his petition and ordered him to wait for news in the same place. Mrs. Tang went back to see Military Governor Tang, handed the petition to him, and begged him to ask the Educational Commissioner to quickly admit this scholar to the examination. Military Governor Tang, because his wife had already accepted Tao Chi's petition, would lose face if he did not handle this matter. Therefore, Military Governor Tang quickly went to see the Educational Commissioner to plead for Tao Sheng. Thus, the Educational Commissioner, considering the face of the Military Governor, admitted Tao Sheng to the examination. As a result, Tao Chi was able to complete all three sessions, developing his talent. Consequently, the two chief and assistant examiners were extremely impressed and praised Tao Chi's work. Thus, the young man, who was only sixteen years old and everyone called Tao Chi Little Scholar, was now known as Tao Chi Little Provincial Graduate after the list was announced.</p>
<p>Tao Chi, with a twentieth-century mind, sat on an eighteenth-century revolving chair, and he actually passed the provincial examination in the year of Qianlong! He was so dazed by the imperial examination that he knew nothing! He was only busy paying respects to his teacher, acknowledging his classmates, and publishing his examination papers. He thought that passing the provincial examination at the age of sixteen was a wonderful story of the dynasty and that he was the number one talent in the world!</p>
<p>"Why hasn't Provincial Graduate Tao come to pay his respects to me, his female patron? If I hadn't accepted his petition, would he have passed this top examination? Quickly send a messenger with a student's card to pay respects to me, his female patron." This was what Military Governor Tang's wife said, sending a soldier to convey the message to Tao Chi.</p>

<h3>Gold Standard Recovers and Rises</h3>
<p>Soaring by Twelve Taels. Yesterday, the 12th, the gold standard suddenly rose sharply, the changes were rapid, rising and falling suddenly, making it difficult to predict. There were a total of twenty taels in retrospect, and people were panicked and unable to stop it. In the end, it rose by another twelve taels. Businessmen frequently traded. The market price fluctuated around 690 taels. The silver market has been rising for two days and was unmoved, tending to rise instead. The foreign exchange market showed a loosening but actually tight trend. Later in the market, there were always more buyers and the exchange rate also increased, the market situation was sharp, and suddenly exceeded 700 taels at the opening. After that, it suddenly turned downstream, and sellers were also active. There was even a rumor of a conflict between Japan and Russia in the Northeast. The market atmosphere suddenly deteriorated, and the bullish trend retreated to 694-5 taels. However, the large bars may see a decline in the future.</p>
<p>Although the price of silver is long, it opens high. From the opening in the morning, it rose 2.5 cents to 686 taels. The large bars rose one-eighth, and the price of silver rose one-half. Secondly, it was 6.3 cents, unexpectedly all the firms had sales and immediately fell to 82.3 cents. However, Tianfeng Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Dade Cheng, and Fuyu all entered, rising more than ten taels immediately, which was really unbelievable. After 9 o'clock, there was a two or three tael market, and then it fell back five or six taels. Then Yuanheng, Qian Changxiang, Tong Taichang, and Wupin Tao Tou sold one after another. The turnover of British gold was 180,625, the recent period was 18, and US gold could be settled at 33 yuan, reaching 85.5 taels at half past nine. British gold announced a long rise of 25, and US gold a long rise of 75, but it was not moved. At this time, it was 86-7 taels, because the internal market was flat, and then it was slightly inferior. Retail investors sold it, and then long-term British gold was 181.25, and at 9:45 it was 84 taels, and then Mai Hang absorbed 181.875, and the shorts on the table slightly made up for it. Dade Cheng, Zhifeng Yong, and Yuan Mao Yong all entered, and at 10:20 it was 89.5 taels. Suddenly, it fell by 2.5 taels, and then added about 2 taels again, but the situation fluctuated until 11:00, and British gold was still 181.25 for both buying and selling, and then it fell to 86.3 taels. After 11:20, it slightly added 2 taels. After entering the market, there were more buyers, Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Yu, Tian Feng Yong, Daxing Yong, and Qian Changxiang all entered, and the bank ate US gold in January at 33 yuan, and it was 93.5 taels when it was about to close, and then it was reduced by 2.5 taels. The closing was suddenly suppressed to 2 taels, which was why the Indian exchange telegraph increased by four anna. The announced price was changed to more than 750 taels, because the US gold was listed for a long rise of three-quarters, and the discount was about 70 taels.</p>
<p>The post-market is more acute. The post-market opened at 93 taels, followed by 92.5 taels. Later, Yuancheng, Zhifeng Yong, Cuichang Yong, etc. all entered, especially US gold tended to rise. Japanese merchants sold to Yuntong December 32.875, then 75 to 625, so the gold price jumped more than 5 taels. After 2:30, it was 98.2 cents, and British gold made a pair of 178125, when it fell back to more than a small tael. After 2:45, Yuancheng, Zhifeng Yong, Daxing Yong, etc. came in, and US gold was only calculated at 32.5625, which was good for eating December British gold 178125, and people were excited, and it had already soared 6 taels, exceeding 700 taels. At 3:15, it reached 702.5 taels, but Yuan Mao Yong, Qian Changxiang, Yongfeng, Heng Yu, Fuyu, etc. all had sales, and immediately returned to within 700 taels. From 3:30 to 4:00, there were ups and downs of two or three taels with each other, Dade Cheng, Cuichang Yong, etc. also sold, and US gold could be settled at 32.6875, and the bank also returned 8125, and the Indian exchange rose by four anna, and it was reported that there was contact between Japan and Russia, etc. Until 4:25, it was only 94 taels, then added 2 taels, and it was 96 taels. The closing was 95.5 taels at 4:30, which was 12 taels higher than last Friday (the 9th). According to the one-day maximum of 702.5 taels and the minimum of 682.3 cents, there was a review of 20.2 cents.</p>
<p>The bare strip is in urgent need of reinstatement. The early market price of Wupin was 86 taels, the noon closing price was 93 taels, the afternoon was 93 taels, and the closing price was 95.5 taels. The announced price was 60 taels. The registration and water replenishment was 93 taels, and the afternoon water replenishment was 96 taels. The spot bare strip was increased by 17 taels, because there was a need and there was not much inventory.</p>
<p>Business in the industry is complicated. Transactions on the table are different in supply and demand. According to statistics, Zhifeng Yong, Dade Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Yu, Tian Feng Yong, Daxing Yong, and Wu Mou all entered, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Futaiheng, Wanxing, Yuantai, Tongchun, and Dakang made a lot of receipts and payments, Tong Taichang, Shunli, Yifeng Yong, Cuichang Yong were mostly sold, Qian Changxiang went out and then entered, Heng Changyong, Yu Da, and Yifeng all went out.

<h3>Different Interest in Foreign Exchange Open and Dark Markets</h3>

However, the European market is still flat, with British gold rising by 25, at one shilling and seven and a half pence, and US gold rising by 75, at 31.75 yuan, and the rest also rose. Hong Kong reduced by five cents, at 78 taels, but the domestic market was counterproductive, first tending to be firm, then slightly depressed, and the noon was better, and the afternoon was even more supportive. The gold market has broken through 700 taels. As a result, it seems to be frustrated, but compared to last Friday before the closure, British gold has shrunk by 3125 and US gold has also shrunk by 3125. It is a strange trend of external loosening and internal tightening. Chinese merchants have slightly scraped together, and British gold has traded more than 100,000 pounds. A telegram from Mumbai bought tens of thousands of pounds, which were sold by Chinese and Japanese banks. US gold has made about 200,000 yuan, with different receipts and payments, but there are no large tickets traded.

<h3>Increased Leeway and Interest Rates</h3>
<p>Market Overview. Yesterday, due to the fact that the banks closed for three days two days ago, the transactions were cleared on one day, and the procedures were naturally complicated. However, the prices of leeway and silver spreads soared very quickly, and the rising trend became increasingly tense. Although it is not as urgent as the previous few days, judging from the situation, the current rising trend is no less than the past, and the current spot in Shanghai is not as abundant as before, and it cannot withstand efforts to collect it. If we continue to collect it, there will inevitably be panic.</p>

"Silver Spread" was three cents in the early market and three cents and two cents in the noon market, which was seven cents higher than the day before.

<h3>Medium- and Long-Term News in the Midst of Tight Silver</h3>
<p>The silver market has been tightening step by step in recent days, and the financial community is facing the successive maturity of long-term funds at the end of the month, which need to be repaid urgently. At this time of tight silver, the desire to return the funds is by no means achievable overnight. The result will be to renew the loans. As for the pledge situation, except for Japanese goods, the rest of the collateral can circulate freely. Therefore, the redemption and sales of the same were calculated to be worth 100,000 in silver, and there were also many who renewed or made new ones. As for the collateral for securities, the prices are changing very rapidly at present, and the original value is also very different from the original value last month. It is difficult to redeem this loan at maturity. Other real estate collateral also has some changes and transfers, etc., but in general, it is difficult to raise cash, and it is difficult to hope for redemption.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Recover Slightly</h3>
<p>Compilation and Reduction 19 Good Rise by 1 yuan and 7 cents</p>
<p>Others also rose slightly, but the downsizing alone fell slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday (12th), the market conditions of various bonds on the Chinese Securities Exchange, although there were several kinds of spot offerings, the transactions were sparse, and the futures market was also more leisurely. Only the consolidated tax and salt tax were offered for the November futures. The situation seemed to be slightly better, and the market was slightly calmer. Although the big players in the market did not see any buying, the selling transactions were far less than before, so each bond gradually trended upwards when it opened in the morning, and the secondary market was firm. For example, the highest of the compilation and reduction of troops had risen by three yuan, and the post-market slowed down. Several of them had risen sharply in the morning and then turned tired, but the consolidated tax, salt tax, and 19 good were still firm. As a result, compared to the end of last week, such as the compilation and reduction of troops and the 19 good October each rose by 1 yuan and 7 cents, the 19 customs also rose by 1 yuan and 1 cent, and the rest were good for several cents to 7 or 8 cents, and only the October downsizing fell slightly. The spot salt tax rose by 2 yuan compared to last week, and the market was quite good. The total spot transaction was 7,000 yuan, the futures were 5.5 million in the morning, and more than 2.7 million in the post-market, totaling 8.215 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Complicated Situation in Yarn, Flower, and Yarn Markets</h3>
<p>Multiple Long and Short Views</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Market. Because of the large number of indirect and direct relations, people have different opinions and different steps. Therefore, the changes in the situation are constantly changing. This is the reason why the futures market fluctuates. At present, according to the position of the goods, the recent period has a real foundation, but the raw cotton market is cheap, and the situation is like this, whether it can stand still depends on the general trend.</p>
<p>The price of futures yarn fluctuates. The standard for 16 counts is Renzhong. At the opening, the market was very weak due to the appearance of more bullish forces. Then it rose because the gold market was favorable to buyers. In the afternoon, it was generally stable. The market conditions for each month are compared as follows. The post-closing ratio increased from the previous day. January 16020, rose 70.</p>
<p>October 16090, rose 10 February 16020, 50</p>
<p>November 16070, 80 March 16010, 20</p>
<p>December 16050, 05</p>

<h3>Compilation of Anti-Japanese Association's Work</h3>
<p>Methods for Raising National Salvation Funds: The Economic Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association's methods for raising national salvation funds are as follows: Article 1: The Association raises national salvation funds, which are collected on its behalf by various Chinese-owned banks, money shops, and trust companies in this city (hereinafter referred to as "financial institutions"). Article 2: Financial institutions that collect national salvation funds on behalf of the Association are entrusted by the Assembly and must not refuse to collect. Article 3: National salvation funds collected by financial institutions are temporarily held and should have the right to be disbursed preferentially. Article 4: Financial institutions that collect national salvation funds should issue receipts with the institution's seal or signed and sealed by the deputy manager. Article 5: Financial institutions that collect national salvation funds must complete a report form every ten days, affix their seal, and notify the Association's Economic Committee once, so that the report can be entered into the ledger, compiled for public announcement, and used for credit. Article 6: The format of the collection report form will be determined separately. Article 7: These measures will be implemented upon approval by the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association.</p>
<p>Notice: Do Not Sell Japanese Fish: The Anti-Japanese Association issued a notice stating, "According to confidential reports, the Japanese ship 'Qing'an' loaded 7,047 sacks of Japanese salmon to be shipped to Shanghai. The goods are piled up in the Longmao warehouse. It is reported that unscrupulous merchants are colluding with the Japanese to purchase the fish from Russia and mix a large quantity of previously stored Japanese fish from the Old Mitsubishi warehouse in Huishan, packing them together in an attempt to sell them locally and ship them inland. In addition, a large number of Japanese goods continue to be shipped to Shanghai, falsely claiming to be goods from the Russian fish merchant Anli Foreign Firm. Therefore, we notify our fish industry to not mix and sell these fish, and to conduct careful inspections."</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Association Warns Sincere Company Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association again warned Sincere Company, stating, "We have received reports that Sincere Company is privately selling Japanese goods. We sent staff to investigate and have received confirmation that Sincere Company is indeed selling Japanese goods. We purchased three feet of printed Indian silk and printed wool serge from employee numbers 240 and 290, totaling thirteen yuan and five jiao. Employee number 290 stated that the printed Indian silk was indeed Japanese goods, and the printed wool serge was French goods, but in fact both were Japanese goods. We are submitting the invoice as evidence. After reviewing the information, we have confirmed that the goods are Japanese. Your company is using the means of 'passing off fish eyes for pearls' to conceal the inferior goods as French goods. This is inappropriate. You should know that this anti-Japanese movement is driven by the unity of the people. At this time of national crisis, when the brutal Japanese invasion continues unabated, all compatriots have united as one, following their conscience, and pledging to adopt a non-cooperative attitude toward Japan and a permanent economic severance to implement the principles of anti-Japanese national salvation. All stores in this city have sealed up Japanese goods and stopped selling them. Unexpectedly, your company is still selling Japanese goods, which is a violation of public opinion and a sabotage of anti-Japanese work. We do not know what your intention is. We are sending this letter as a question and returning the purchased Japanese silk and invoice for your inspection. Please also respond to how you intend to dispose of the Japanese goods in your possession and return the purchase price."</p>
<p>Acquired Goods Sent to Warehouse for Safekeeping: Since the news of the Northeast emergency, the Inspection Department of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has intensified its inspection efforts. The various district inspection offices have been seizing enemy goods daily, piling up like mountains. With the exception of a small number of cases where goods were mistakenly seized and returned after verification, the rest are sent to the warehouse for safekeeping, pending further discussion.</p>

Also arriving on the same ship were Mr. Gao, an employee of the Jichang Railway, and more than 30 women and children who had fled from Fengtian, arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Returning from Japan: Overseas Chinese in Japan are returning to the country one after another. More than a thousand have already arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Japanese postal ship Nagasaki Maru arrived from Japan, carrying another large group of overseas Chinese, including 116 returning from Kobe and 29 from Nagasaki. These overseas Chinese were mostly from Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, working in the kimono and barber industries. Before leaving Japan, each person surrendered their re-entry permit to the Japanese police, as they were preparing not to return.</p>

<h3>New Contributions from the Drug Resistance Association to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>Sends Letter to the Anti-Japanese Association Proposing Five Points</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants' Conspiracies Should Be Noted by the Chinese People</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps of the Republic of China Drug Resistance Association sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese Association yesterday stating, "We, the members of this Association, are deeply pained by the urgency of foreign aggression and saddened by the impending national demise. In addition to dedicating most of our time to the anti-Japanese national salvation propaganda work, we have been paying attention to the anti-Japanese movement and observing its progress. We would like to briefly present some of our views for your consideration, and at the same time, expand the anti-Japanese propaganda and various practical national salvation works to fulfill our national duty. All the proposed suggestions are listed below: (1) Unify Slogans: The slogans posted on various streets are currently complex and inconsistent, some are childish, some are weak, and some use inappropriate tones. Although this stems from patriotic enthusiasm and the inability to choose words carefully, it is ultimately ineffective. It seems that your association should come forward and advocate for the unification of anti-Japanese slogans. The number of times slogans are posted should be determined each week, and each slogan should be standardized. Beforehand, the main standards of each slogan should be announced to all sectors, so that those who are enthusiastic about saving the country have something to follow. (2) Encourage the Courage of the Chinese People: The propaganda texts and national paintings posted on the streets all expose and depict the brutal appearance of the Japanese flaunting their power, like wolves and tigers, and the tragic situation of the Chinese people crying and trembling. This kind of slogan is very likely to make compatriots feel fearful and shrinking from the Japanese, and lose their heroic spirit. Your association should produce as much as possible about encouraging the heroic spirit of the Chinese people to move forward courageously and remove the timid mentality of the Chinese people. On the one hand, more slogans should be made to expose the dangers of the Japanese themselves, such as announcing the infighting of parties in Japan, the lurking of proletarian communists, the cracks in the collapse of the national economy, and the hidden dangers in Korea and Taiwan that are waiting for an opportunity to break out, etc., to strengthen the courage of the Chinese people and expose the weakness of the enemy. (3) Use Sails to Write Slogans: Sailing boats are useful tools for water transportation. Large and small commercial ports in all cities across the country, as well as inland villages and towns, all travel back and forth. Your association should advocate that all Chinese sailing boats coming and going along the Wusongkou, Huangpu River, and Xinkai River areas write eye-catching anti-Japanese slogans, so that the propaganda power reaches the interior wherever the boats travel. Please ask all localities to imitate this. (4) Pay Attention to Foreign Propaganda: There are many English newspapers and publications sponsored by Chinese people in Mupu, such as the Continental Daily, the National Weekly, and the China Review, etc. Your association should contact these newspapers and ask them to gather strength and carry out organized foreign propaganda so that foreigners can thoroughly understand the truth about the brutal Japanese invasion of China and take a fair stand. (5) Prevent Japanese Merchants' Conspiracies: According to reliable sources, banks operated by Japanese are now using foreign banks as indirect agencies to interact with Chinese banks. Please ask your association to send a letter to the Chinese employees of each foreign bank, asking them to refuse to cooperate. It is also heard that Japanese goods are shipped to Hong Kong, and Chinese and foreign trademarks are changed to be mixed and sold in the interior. An electrical request should also be sent to all industries and businesses in Hong Kong and the country to pay attention and find ways to stop this. The above suggestions are considered important. Please adopt them as much as possible. We are eagerly looking forward to your response. Sincerely, the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association."</p>
<h3>Telegraph from the Lawyers' Association to Shi Zhaoji</h3>
<p>Shenshi News reports that a telegraph was sent to His Excellency Dr. Shi Zhaoji, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China in Geneva: "The sinister and bellicose Japan has long been determined to dominate the world. Its national policy is to use force to subdue the United States, defeat Russia, and annex India and the Nanyang Islands. The sequence of implementation is to take Manchuria and suppress China as the initial step. This pre-determined plan, presented by Tanaka Giichi, explains each of its aggressions, which are not limited to East Asia. The statesmen of all countries should have seen this early on. Now the heinous drama of occupying Manchuria has suddenly opened. Our peace-loving Chinese nation has endured and retreated, waiting for the League of Nations' resolution to withdraw troops and return to defense to take effect. However, Japan has gone a step further, deploying troops and increasing its fleet, oppressing our entire territory and treating the League of Nations as nothing. The dangerous trend in the future cannot be prevented by empty words. We sincerely hope that the League of Nations will uphold the principles of self-help and mutual assistance and adopt appropriate and effective methods to prevent a single Japanese soldier or warship from entering our territory, so as to reverse the disaster and ensure peace. Otherwise, for the sake of self-defense and survival, our nation will have to find another way and not engage in futile dealings with the League of Nations or be subject to useless restrictions. Respectfully, Li Shirui, Tan Yi, and Lu Shaozong of the Shanghai Lawyers' Association send this urgent telegraph."</p>

<p>Sheng Silk Industry Refuses to Use Japanese Raw Materials: More than 50 silk and satin businesses from the Sheng Silk Industry Association held a general meeting of members at the Shengjing Silk Industry Association yesterday, at which they immediately resolved to: (1) Establish an inspection team to automatically inspect Japanese goods of the same industry; (2) Send a special letter to the Shengze Silk Industry Association to urge the formation of an inspection team to refuse the import of Japanese raw materials; (3) Members purchasing yarn must first register and obtain certification from this team; (4) Once Japanese raw materials are discovered, the team will severely punish the member, and the specific measures will be determined separately.</p>
<p>Transportation Automobile Industry Discusses Proposals: The Transportation Automobile Industry Association held a temporary executive committee meeting the day before yesterday to continue discussing anti-Japanese national salvation and other proposals. Chairman Jiang Zhongying first asked investigator Ye Hanjun to report, stating that some patriotic members had already stopped loading Japanese goods, but there were still one or two who did not recognize the greater cause and continued to load them privately. It was discussed how to deal with this. It was resolved to send a letter of warning, stating that if they did not follow their conscience and load Japanese goods again, once it was discovered, not only would their rights in the association be suspended, but they would also be reported to the National Salvation Association for severe punishment. Other proposals were then discussed, and the meeting adjourned at 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>Kang Yuan Factory Establishes National Salvation Volunteer Army: Kang Yuan Factory employees are outraged by the brutality and arrogance of the powerful Japanese. In addition to implementing economic severance, they organized a National Salvation Volunteer Army, quickly enrolling 120 people. Responsible personnel were elected, and the army was formally established yesterday morning. The factory's general manager, Xiang Kangyuan, and factory director, Shen Wen'en, gave speeches one after another, and shouted slogans, including "We are surrounded by dead ends, there is only one bloody road ahead, we must fight our way out to survive," and "Do not seek help from others, do not ask for guns and cannons, just be willing to die," which were extremely solemn.</p>

Mr. Yu arrived at the Japanese Consulate at 11:20 AM. As the Consul-General was out, Consul Shirai represented him in the meeting. Mr. Yu explained his intentions to Mr. Shirai and demanded that the Japanese side severely restrict the illegal actions of these rogues to avoid causing incidents. The Japanese side stated that it was willing to do its best to stop such actions to prevent events that could lead to escalation. However, it also requested that the Municipal Government restrict our patriotic movements.</p>

<h3>Adding Posts on North Szechuan Road</h3>
<p>Local Peace Yesterday</p>
<p>Since Japanese gathered crowds to cause trouble in the North Szechuan Road area, the Hongkou Police Station has increased the number of detectives, implemented strict defenses, set up double sentry posts at key locations, and increased the number of Chinese and Western detectives patrolling the area. Yesterday, due to the increased defenses, the area was quite peaceful.</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation 17th District Branch, immediately convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures against the Japanese rioters who caused trouble on North Szechuan Road. They also appointed Wang Jian'e and Chen Xisheng as representatives. The meeting adjourned at 10 pm. Afterwards, they contacted the Hongkou Police Station. The written report submitted by the two representatives to the association is as follows: (1) The representatives thanked the police station for its swift action in quickly stopping the Japanese rioters from disrupting order. (The Police Chief replied) "It is our duty. We are uneasy about your association's special trip to express gratitude." (2) The representatives stated the Japanese atrocities. "If such incidents occur again, it is advisable for your police station to make proper plans in order to protect the local people and merchants to prevent any unforeseen circumstances." (The Police Chief replied) "Our police station treats both Chinese and Japanese people equally without any bias. However, the reason for the Japanese disturbance was due to the posting of slogans. Our police station also understands that your people are motivated by patriotic indignation, so we cannot forcibly intervene. However, to prevent conflict, please advise your merchants to refrain from posting slogans. As for increasing the number of police officers, the police force is insufficient to allocate. However, if an accident occurs, we will use the fastest method to stop it. We hope that your merchants will not resist." Finally, the representatives believed that the slogans were the most orderly way for the merchants to encourage themselves, as they had been repeatedly humiliated by the Japanese, and there was no insult or slander against the Japanese. It was difficult to accept the advice to refrain from posting slogans and hoped for understanding. As for resistance, the representatives guaranteed that the merchants in the area would always abide by the law, and asked them not to worry. However, the private complaints of the association members who were harmed should be reserved.</p>
<p>In addition, Chen Jiufeng and Yu Mingxun, members of the preparatory committee, went to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and the Citizens' Federation to report the Japanese trouble-making on North Szechuan Road. Their letter stated, "Dear Sirs, yesterday at 3:30 pm, more than a hundred Japanese people, supported by armed Japanese soldiers, swarmed in and tore down patriotic slogans door-to-door in the North Szechuan Road area. They threw pebbles into the shops, and the small shop owner of Wang Shengtai Tailors, a member of our association, was beaten in the back of his hand and kicked in the abdomen by the Japanese. Such rampant insults are intolerable. We have sent representatives to you to explain everything in detail. We respectfully ask for your strong assistance to punish the past and prevent the future. This is a public feeling."</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Maintains Security in the Concession</h3>
<p>To Summon the International Merchant Corps If Necessary</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that yesterday (11th), when Japanese residents were demonstrating on North Szechuan Road, armed Japanese marines were protecting them. Today (12th), the reporter interviewed Mr. Fessenden, Secretary-General of the Public Works Department, who stated that the PWD police force was sufficient to maintain law and order. Japanese soldiers were not invited to help yesterday. If the situation changes suddenly and the police force is insufficient, the American Merchant Corps will be summoned for assistance. If necessary, the leading consuls will also be asked to provide necessary assistance to maintain the law and order within the concession. Mr. Fessenden also repeatedly stated that the duty of the Public Works Department is to protect all residents within the concession, regardless of nationality, so it must maintain strict neutrality. Currently, because the police force is sufficient to handle the situation, there has been no discussion about summoning the Merchant Corps. Although the feelings between the Chinese and Japanese people are very intense, there is no need to panic.</p>
<h3>Recent Actions of Japanese Warships and Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>Japanese Warships Demonstrate Everywhere</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Transport Residents Elsewhere</p>
<p>The "Tenryu" went to Nanjing. The Japanese Naval Department dispatched the cruiser "Tenryu" with 220 marines, and the "Tokiwa" from Sasebo, with 230 marines, and transported a large number of military supplies at the same time to Shanghai on Double Ten Day. The two ships were anchored on the Huangpu River in front of the Osaka Wharf in Yangshupu. In addition to the marines from the "Tokiwa" landing, the cruiser "Tenryu" was ordered yesterday to leave Shanghai at 9 am and proceed to Nanjing with the marines. The ship also had a large number of munitions, which will be supplied to the Japanese ships of the first foreign dispatch unit in the Yangtze River. The "Tenryu" arrived in Nanjing and was anchored on the Xiaguan River.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Transport Tianjin Residents. Yesterday, Dalian Steamship Company confirmed that the company had provided the passenger ship "Tencho Maru" for the Japanese government's investigation. It was sent to Tianjin, preparing to transport the consul and Japanese residents from Tianjin if necessary. The Baihe River has been silted up for a long time, and ships can only reach Tanggu and cannot enter the port. Now, the ship is venturing in to transport Japanese residents from Tianjin, and Japanese merchants in Tianjin are preparing to board.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents in Wenzhou Go to Taiwan. The Japanese warship "Yahagi" sailed from Nanhua to Wenzhou to demonstrate to us, but it left Ou after berthing for only one day. Yesterday, this port received a telegram from Wenzhou that Japanese merchants in Wenzhou have been ordered to leave. Japan sent a ship to Wenzhou to carry the Japanese residents to Keelung, Taiwan. It is reported that the Japanese consul stationed in Wenzhou has also sealed up the consulate's property and taken away public property before leaving Wenzhou to Shanghai.</p>
<p>"Toba" Demonstrates in Xun. The Japanese coastal defense gunboat "Toba" went from Hankou to Jiujiang. The marines on the ship arbitrarily landed and took weapons to the streets to demonstrate to our citizens under the pretext of buying goods. The ship is still in Xunbu, with its guns pointing at our commercial port.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhiyuan, Reporter of "Mainichi Shimbun," Attempts Suicide in Anger at Japan, Rescued</h3>
<p>Sacrificed Blood on His Arm to Warn Compatriots During the May 30th Movement</p>
<p>Unemployed for Five Years After May 30th Movement, Unable to Support Himself</p>
<p>Unwilling to Work for the Japanese, Unable to Enlist in the Army</p>
<p>Abandoned His Eighty-Year-Old Grandmother, Wife, and Son</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Zhiyuan, a Chinese reporter for the Japanese-owned "Mainichi Shimbun" in this city, was filled with righteous indignation at the violent Japanese invasion and the many difficulties of the country. Unable to vent his anger, he attempted suicide. The doctor's letter to the Anti-Japanese Association and his will are excerpted below.</p>
<p>Doctor's Letter. Dr. Yuan Liangzou, Dean of Fusheng Hospital, wrote to the Anti-Japanese Association: "Dear Sirs, at 10 am on the 3rd of this month, I rushed to No. 10 Kaiyi Lane, Fusheng Road, to see a patient, Liu Zhiyuan, courtesy name Jiuchuan, 26 years old, from Tianjin. He was in a coma and in critical condition. It was discovered that he had taken sleeping pills ("Dicl," two empty bottles were left under the bed) on the evening of the 2nd with the intention of committing suicide. After my best efforts, I managed to wash his stomach and inject an emetic to expel part of the drug from his body. After working for two days and one night, he was rescued from danger. The suicide note and writings of the suicide Liu Zhiyuan were found at the time. I inquired of his close friend, Mr. Chu, who knew that Liu was a promising and enthusiastic young man. He graduated from Tongwen College in Tianjin and was fluent in English and Japanese. During the May 30th Movement, he cut his arm and shed blood while giving a speech to the masses in Tianjin, writing a book to warn his compatriots. His left arm still has scars. In May of this year, due to difficult living conditions, he was forced to,</p>
<p>On the Advice of a Friend, He Took a Job at the "Mainichi Shimbun" Established by the Japanese. This time, because the Eastern Provinces were lost, he resigned in righteous indignation for losing land and humiliating the country. However, a family of several people was in danger of starvation. It was even more difficult to ask to fight the enemy. He was in a dilemma, which led to depression and pain, and thus to suicide. Now, I am copying a paper with the will he left to his close friend Mr. Chu, a photo of Liu taken a few days ago, and a booklet written by himself (the original book is kept by Liu's wife), and sending them to you with the letter. Please edit and publish a press release and forward it to various newspapers to encourage the people of the country. I also beg you to report to the authorities and seek remedial measures, so as not to cause ordinary patriotic and promising young people to have no way to ask to fight, no way to make a living, and fall into a dead end. I am very grateful. This is addressed to the comrades of the Anti-Japanese Association."</p>
<p>Full Text of the Will. Brother Huafu, since you came to Shanghai, I have not been able to help you in any way, and I have lost the way of making friends. Now, I am entrusting you with the "rotten fish head," which I am really sorry for. The reason why I did this is also because I have no choice. Please see the essays I have written recently. Although they are just babbling, they are my inner and physical pain. Recently, I have also tried my best to consider, but the result is still no good solution. It is better to go crazy in the future than to be straightforward. The most important thing is that you still should not be sad. I have been deeply impressed since the May 30th Movement. In this government of our country that does not care about the suffering of the people, and given my weak and incompetent self, it is natural that I do not have a job to support my family. However, although I was unemployed, I have been holding on for four or five years before I had no choice but to go to work in the "Mainichi Shimbun" established by the Japanese in May of this year. That kind of embarrassment is really unspeakable. This time, after I wanted to resign, I rushed to the Anti-Japanese Front to do the work of "killing the enemy and achieving results." Of course, there is no way to force it, and the government does not have this kind of determination. What am I, an ordinary person who shouts with his bare hands? I saw the Japanese barracks at the end of North Szechuan Road, and these messages of murder that flew like snowflakes. The blood of my pain and anger spewed out of my mouth and nose like a raging tide without realizing it. I wanted the blood I spewed out to turn into poisonous gas and directly attack the bodies of the Japanese slaves and those useless treacherous merchants, the running dogs of the country. My compatriots died in one place, which is my supreme glory. Hardship, pain, and anger cannot be solved. I also thought about taking the kitchen knife I usually use at home and running to the Japanese barracks to make a mess. This is even more impossible. I am afraid that others will scold me for being ignorant and harming the country. Forget it, forget it. I am really depressed, sad, and angry to the extreme, and that is why I resorted to this plan. I have already entrusted my second brother, Gao Yongxiang. Please brother, take care of my grandmother in her twilight years (she is 80 years old and lives by her grandson), and let Wen Zhen and Hu'er return home. As for my body, it can be buried in Shanghai. I don't want to go back to the north anymore. I don't want monks to curse me. Please make it as simple and frugal as possible. No shroud, no coffin. Please advise Wen Zhen not to be sad (Wen Zhen is Liu's wife). The reason why I don't want to write her another letter is that I know that I am so sorry for her. Please forgive me. A few days ago, I asked her and Mrs. Li to go back together, which means I didn't want her to see our eternal separation in Shanghai with her own eyes. But she always refused to leave me. I am really sorry for her. I have to run out of her arms and say goodbye to her forever. Please tell Wen Zhen to take care of herself. Furthermore, Hu'er (Liu's son, who is now six years old) is born intelligent. You must know that intelligence is definitely not a blessing. Please don't ask her to study. It is best to be a worker. I wish him to be poor and become a tough guy, and not become a cheap and rich man. Please tell Wen Zhen to call Hu'er by the surname Li from now on. Never use the surname Liu. The surname Liu cannot give him any benefits. Never, never. Wen Zhen is in her prime and does not worry about having a good husband like Sima Xiangru. Please choose for yourself. This is the last conversation. I wish you victory in the future, Liu Zhiyuan."</p>
<h3>Tax Police Regiment Holds Memorial Service for Kang Baosen Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Chinese Yarn Merchants Do Not Raise Prices Opportunistically</h3>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Mill Association sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday: "Dear Sirs, we have received two letters, stating that Chinese cotton yarn merchants should not raise prices opportunistically during this time of anti-Japanese salvation, and requesting us to inform the factories to limit sales prices and not arbitrarily increase them. We know everything. It is the greatest shame for the Chinese people that Japan invaded our Eastern Provinces. Even women and children are deeply indignant. Our factories will not bear to make selfish profits at this time when the country is in danger. We hope that you will understand this. However, since the violent Japanese occupied Shenyang, the market price of cotton yarn has once risen. The reason for this rise is certainly related to the anti-Japanese movement, but the small amount of cotton yarn stored in Shanghai is also an important reason. That is to say, the rise is related to the anti-Japanese movement, but it is not that the factories are hoarding goods and deliberately raising prices, but it is actually due to unavoidable speculative phenomena in commerce. Supply and demand are the principles of economics. The rise and fall of market prices cannot be controlled by some people. For example, the highest price of 42-count yarn in January once rose to 400 taels, and 20-count yarn also rose to 200 taels. At that time, there was no anti-Japanese movement. In recent months, 20-count yarn has been hovering between 180 and 190 taels, and 16-count yarn has also been hovering between 170 and 180 taels. The facts are all there and can be reviewed. Recently, due to the increasing foreign troubles and the depletion of stocks, there was indeed a period of rising prices, but it soon became gentle again. Moreover, in recent weeks, our factories have not only sold out all the current yarn, but also successively thrown out futures at no cost. Otherwise, the price increase would have been even more fierce. This is enough to prove that Chinese factories have not taken the opportunity to raise prices and make selfish profits. We hereby inform you of the above information. In addition to notifying the factories again, we hope that you will observe and understand, etc."</p>
<h3>Showcase Samples Should Be Changed to Display Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to all branch offices, trade associations, and store members yesterday regarding changing showcase displays to domestic goods: "Dear Sirs, on the 8th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods, stating that the 4th emergency meeting of the 11th session of our association decided to ask the City Chamber of Commerce to send a letter to all trade associations in the city to notify all stores under their jurisdiction to display domestic goods samples in showcases to expand the promotion of domestic goods. Considering that it is now the season of intense boycott of Japanese goods, the promotion of domestic goods should not be delayed and should be stepped up. All stores should change the samples in all showcases to domestic goods to give citizens the opportunity to recognize domestic goods and arouse the concept of purchasing domestic goods in all circles, which is a way to promote the sales of domestic goods. In response to the discussion, we hereby send a letter to your association, asking you to consider the immaturity of domestic goods and the lack of promotion, and to quickly send a letter to your affiliated trade associations to inform all stores to change all showcase samples to domestic goods to correct perceptions and benefit the promotion. We are grateful for your cooperation. Considering that it is now a time of vigorous boycott of Japanese goods, the promotion of domestic goods is indeed urgent. All businesses will change the displays in their showcases to domestic goods, which will easily arouse the concept of customers purchasing domestic goods and achieve the effect of promoting the sales of domestic goods. In response to the letter, we hereby send a notice to you for your information and notification, etc."</p>

<h3>Japanese Fishing Boats Arrive in Wusong</h3>
<p>Fishermen Are Extremely Indignant</p>
<p>Japanese fishing boats have repeatedly invaded our country's territorial waters to fish in the Wusong area. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau's aquatic sector presented the case to the Naval Department to send warships to stop them, and the Jianghai Customs prohibited Japanese ships from entering the port to sell fish to protect fishing rights. Yesterday afternoon, a Japanese fishing boat, "Kitayama," suddenly arrived in Wusong, fully loaded with fish stolen from our country's territorial waters, and was unloading and selling them. This was known to the fishermen of Wusong Port, who were extremely indignant and planned to destroy the ship. However, the ship knew that it could not offend public anger and immediately weighed anchor and left Wusong without entering the port.</p>

<h3>Taihu Bandit Leader Arrested</h3>
<p>The Judge Repeated the Name "Zhou Changhai" Twice, and Xia Liangzhi Unintentionally Revealed Himself, After Investigating the Kidnapping Case, He Will Be Transferred</p>
<p>Wang Yunlong, a patrol officer from the Sixth Team of the Second District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Force in Wuxi, previously apprehended Cao Jiarong, a bandit from Anhui who operated in the Taihu Lake area, within his jurisdiction. During interrogation, it was revealed that Cao had committed numerous crimes, including robberies in the Taihu area, as well as a major kidnapping and extortion case in Dongting Dongshan. Cao also identified the leaders of the gang as Wu Huaizhen, Ju Changhai, Xu Wenyuan, and Qian Wenjiang, who were said to have fled to Shanghai. Upon receiving this information, Patrol Officer Wang brought Cao and several detectives to Shanghai to conduct a search. After several days of fruitless searching, on the 9th of this month, Patrol Officer Wang and his team were walking along Hankou Road when Cao suddenly pointed out a man walking on the street and identified him as Fang Yimin, a henchman of Zhou Changhai. Wang and his team discreetly followed Fang, and saw him enter Room 24 of the Ruizhong Hotel at No. 645 Hankou Road. Wang immediately assigned someone to keep watch and reported the situation to the Lao Zha Police Station. With the assistance of Chinese Detective Huang Yingjie, they went to Room 24 and found Fang and another man inside. Cao identified the second man as their leader, Zhou Changhai. However, Zhou denied this, claiming his name was Xia Liangqi and not Zhou Changhai. Detective Huang then took Fang and the other man into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, explained the case and stated that the Public Security Team had not requested the transfer of the two defendants, Xia Liangqi and Fang Yimin. However, according to the agreement, sufficient evidence was required to prove that the transfer was justified. He requested the court's attention. Following this, Patrol Officer Wang submitted an official document, requesting the transfer and stating that the provincial government had also issued an arrest warrant for Zhou Changhai, urging that he be brought to justice. Cao Jiarong also submitted a statement, testifying that Xia Liangqi was an alias for Zhou Changhai. When questioned, Xia Liangqi vehemently denied being Zhou Changhai. However, during an unintentional moment, Judge Shen Bingrong called out "Zhou Changhai" twice, and Xia responded both times. The judge then informed him that he had now admitted to being Zhou Changhai and should confess to the crimes he had committed. However, Xia continued to evade the question. The police lawyer Ru then stated that there was no doubt that the defendant Xia Liangqi was Zhou Changhai. The crimes he had committed were also evident and he could be transferred. However, the victims of the kidnapping case mentioned by Patrol Officer Wang had not yet been identified. For the sake of caution, it would be appropriate to postpone the transfer until after the victims had been identified. Judge Shen approved this request and ordered both defendants to be returned to custody. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Price Increase Issue of Tap Water in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>Experts Held Final Meeting with Users Yesterday and Planned to Submit Report to the Municipal Council for Approval Within Days</p>
<p>Due to the tap water company's 25% price increase, public concession tap water users found it difficult to bear the cost.

<h3>The Frozen Fish Industry Refuses to Purchase Salmon from Xiamen</h3>
<p>Suspecting it is Japanese Goods</p>
<p>According to Xinshi News, the frozen fish industry association has been working exceptionally hard on anti-Japanese efforts. Since organizing a Japanese goods inspection team, each committee member has been assigned to conduct inspections. Recently, the association discovered that Anli Foreign Company, a British firm, had shipped over 7,000 packages of salmon on the Qing'an Maru, followed by another shipment of over 50,000 dan of the same fish on the Rong Maru. Both shipments are currently stored at the Longmao Warehouse. The foreign company claimed that the salmon originated from Russia and that the Russian consulate had provided a certificate of proof. Therefore, they requested the anti-Japanese association to send personnel to verify the origin and allow the sale. However, the frozen fish industry association stated that the salmon looked similar to Japanese products, making it difficult to distinguish. They feared that they could be easily confused, which would hinder the anti-Japanese efforts. To effectively avoid any suspicion, the association decided to refuse to purchase the salmon, regardless of whether it was of Russian origin. They would only resume purchasing after the anti-Japanese association had conducted a thorough verification, issued a public announcement confirming that the fish was Russian, and authorized its sale. Yesterday, they sent personnel to the Longmao Warehouse to strictly monitor the situation and urgently notified all fish shops to refrain from purchasing the salmon privately.</p>

<h3>Pudong Fellow-Villagers Association Seeks Members for Celebration Banquet</h3>
<p>Planning to Hold Commodity Fair During Inaugural Meeting</p>
<p>The Pudong Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai held a celebration banquet and preparatory meeting to seek members at the Atlantic Restaurant on October 9th at 7:00 PM. Attendees included Du Yuesheng, Mu Ouchu, Lü Yuequan, Huang Renzhi, Gao Junxiang, Jiang Zhuoyun, Chen Xianxin, Tao Bingjun, Zhang Xiaoliang, Qu Shaoyi, Yang Yunzhong, Zhang Shangyi, Pan Zhiwen, Yao Weixiong, Zhang Bochu, Pan Hongding, Min Caizhang, Gong Huibai, Jin Hongxiang, Bao Qinxuan, Qu Songjia, Wang Qinbo, Ye Tingfan, Zhang Yuchi, Ruan Jiefan, Lei Jihan, Xie Bingheng, Chen Sanlin, Cheng Weiyu, Zhu Shaoqi, Sun Danren, Chang Shunquan, Fu Zuoheng, Xu Baoming, Yao Yizhang, Wang Zengxian, Gu Jiuru, He Zhensheng, and others, totaling over a hundred people. Mu Ouchu was elected chairman, and Lu Jingqing was the recorder. Chairman Mu Ouchu began by stating the outstanding achievements in this round of membership recruitment, which relied on the enthusiasm and perseverance of the fellow villagers to achieve this. The results of the membership recruitment show that as of October 8th, a total of over 55,000 points have been accumulated, and over 16,600 members have been recruited (surpassing all other fellow-villagers associations in Shanghai). This is the foundation for all future endeavors of the association. The second step is to build a giant building with five or six floors and a large auditorium that can accommodate four or five thousand people in the shortest possible time. The location should be about three to five acres in size, which is crucial for public image and is currently being planned. Looking ahead, they hope to work hard with fellow villagers to achieve this goal. The previously planned inaugural meeting on Double Tenth Festival had to be postponed due to the precarious national situation. During the inaugural meeting, a commodity fair will be set up to showcase and facilitate procurement. All businesses operated by Pudong fellow villagers, such as banks, insurance companies, construction companies, real estate companies, and factories producing goods such as wool fabrics, socks, clothing, towels, lace, matches, and cigarettes, as well as local specialties and handicrafts from various counties, should be widely displayed and promoted. In the future, there should be mutual assistance and improvement among the businesses operated by fellow villagers. This can develop the economic power of the hometown and revitalize various new businesses, indirectly increasing the wealth of the province and the country. Isn't this a great thing? Within the universe, only economic power is the most powerful and solid. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the various domestic turmoils in China have generally been economically linked to the people of the Japanese archipelago. There have been no less than seven or eight anti-Japanese boycotts, but they have always ended in failure. Since the Liaoyang Incident, it has been felt that it is impossible to live in peace, and the only way to reverse the decline is to start with a permanent boycott of Japanese goods as a passive means of national salvation. Because not buying Japanese goods is a right for everyone, it is hoped that fellow villagers will not delay in implementing this during this critical time of crisis and survival. Next, the winners of the various membership recruitment teams were announced. The first, second, and third place winners were Pan Zhiwen, Jin Hongxiang, and Yang Jiasun. The outstanding team leaders were Li Huchen, Chen Tingzhang, and Bu Zhijian. The individuals with the most points were Chen Zixin, Qu Jiugao, and Wang Xin'an. After the chairman's thank-you speech, he mentioned that Mr. Pan Zhiwen and others had proposed to change the silver shield awards to calligraphy and paintings, and asked for a vote. The chairman then appointed Huang Renzhi and Lu Jingqing to handle the matter. The attendees expressed their support. Ruan Jiefan then thanked the chairman on behalf of the recruitment team. Finally, the chairman also mentioned the progress of the pond construction committee and discussed the merger of various Shanghai-based fellow-villagers organizations, which attracted attention from the attendees. Ruan Jiefan and Gu Wensheng also discussed this in detail. Qu Shaoyi then reported on the history and current situation of the various fellow-villagers organizations in Shanghai (including a detailed account of the Pudong Public Office's fundraising for the construction of the Dongjiadu Wharf) and discussed the merger plan. Gu Wensheng presented Zhangyu Company's famous wine, which was highly praised by the attendees. In addition, the Pudong Bank distributed commemorative stationery to the guests. Chairman Mu also described the bank's ample funds, stable investments, favorable interest rates, and special preferential treatment for fellow villagers, stating that it had a close relationship with the planned projects of the fellow-villagers association and could celebrate its development together.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Military Officer Academy Quartermaster Deputy Flees and is Arrested</h3>
<p>Shi Wei, a 35-year-old quartermaster deputy of the Wuhan Branch of the Central Military Academy, suddenly fled without a trace a few days ago. The academy immediately launched a search. Subsequently, Wang Zhiguo, a major and adjutant of the academy, encountered Shi Wei in the port of Nanjing while on official business. At that time, Shi Wei was with his wife, Ms. Wang, his servant, Yang, and his son, along with their luggage, preparing to board a ship to Shanghai. Wang asked Shi why he had left the academy. Shi replied that he had urgent matters to attend to in Shanghai and had taken a three-week leave of absence from the academy. Wang Zhiguo, considering that the country was in a time of crisis and the National Government had issued orders prohibiting personnel from all affiliated agencies from taking leave at will, wondered how Shi had obtained permission from the academy to take leave to go to Shanghai. He became suspicious and immediately telegraphed the academy to inquire about the facts. The academy replied that Shi had not requested leave and was indeed fleeing without permission. Wang was alarmed by this information and, without making a sound, tracked Shi to Shanghai. He then saw Shi and his family staying at the Xinxinglong Hotel near Guanqiao in the Nanshi area. He immediately reported the situation to the First District Headquarters and requested that the police be dispatched to make an arrest. The police quickly arrived at the hotel, took Shi Wei, his family, and their luggage into custody, and brought them to the headquarters. Under interrogation, they determined that the matter involved a fleeing officer and ordered that an official document be prepared and sent to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>

<h3>News from Various Labor Unions</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army forcibly occupied key areas of the Northeast, many Chinese sailors working on Japanese merchant ships have voluntarily resigned and reported to the Shanghai Seamen's Union. The union believes that the resignation of these sailors from Japanese ship positions is entirely motivated by patriotism. Now that they have resigned, the union should design plans to maintain them and send letters to each seamen's branch and local branch to use the spirit of mutual assistance among seamen to find work for the unemployed sailors.</p>
<p>The Medicine Industry Labor Union held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday, chaired by Weng Dongsheng. (A) Reports. (B) Discussions. (1) Tai Cheng Hangzhan Company reported to the union that all rent, cart, and rope costs of the company were to be deducted from the company's profits. It was decided that this was inconsistent and the union should negotiate the matter. (2) Apprentice Tong Wenrong had not completed one year of apprenticeship but was taking profit from the company. How should this be handled? It was decided that Tong Wenrong was still an apprentice, and the profits already distributed would not be recovered to show leniency. In the future, in addition to the wages the apprentice should receive, the remaining money should be used to purchase food and distribute it to all members as a warning. (3) In the future, whether local or from other places, all who serve as managers must first join the union and undergo a one-year apprenticeship before they can open a business. It was decided to pass this and notify all members.</p>

<h3>News from Jin Dingyi of Songjiang</h3>
<p>(Chum salmon is Japanese, not Russian)</p>
<p>Japan is using White Russians to transport large quantities of chum salmon to Shanghai merchants, falsely claiming it to be Russian fish. I wonder what the attitude of Shanghai salted fish dealers and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association is. The public in other places is paying close attention because it is rumored that the Shanghai salted fish industry has already recognized it as Russian goods and will soon be opening sales, causing unease among the public in various places, fearing that the boycott will become a pie in the sky. In my opinion, everyone knows that chum salmon is Japanese goods. (Remainder omitted)</p>
<p>News from Shen Sucun of Changzhou (Do not use foreign ginseng at banquets)</p>
<p>The other day, when I was passing through Shanghai from Zhejiang, I caught a glimpse of a certain Southern goods store on the Great Horse Road openly displaying dozens of fins of enemy goods and dozens of foreign ginsengs strung like tassels above the counter. They also prominently advertised "Kanto Red Flag Ginseng," deceiving customers without leaving any loopholes. Please tell the Anti-Japanese Association to give a warning first and order them to quickly change "Kanto" to "Japanese goods." Moreover, Red Flag Ginseng has disappeared from the market for many years. The shape of the Ten-Fan Ginseng is similar, and it is used to imitate it. In fact, the nourishing effect is not very different. Furthermore, if patriotic people attend banquets, do not eat the following dishes: "Shrimp Roe Foreign Ginseng," "Braised Shark Lips," "Mixed Agar-Agar," "Dried Scallop Soup," "Abalone Soup," "Shark Fin," "Fish Skin," "Fried Kai Yang," "Fried Donggu," "Mixed Kelp," "Seaweed Soup," etc. All of the above items are absolutely unavailable in China. Wish diners pay attention to it. News from a certain gentleman (Hoping that domestic yarn factories will not raise the price of double-strand yarn) Most of the double-strand yarn raw materials needed by my country's cotton weaving and knitting industries are supplied by Japan and Japanese-owned factories in China, with a small portion coming from British and domestic factories. Recently, Japan invaded our country's Northeast, and tragic cases have occurred. The Chinese people are driven by righteous indignation and automatically do not buy Japanese goods. This is a manifestation of the patriotic heart of the Chinese people, not wanting to provide Japan with money to be used to shoot our people. The motive is very pure, and the behavior is very admirable. However, in fact, a big problem has arisen due to the lack of double-strand yarn. Now I am ordering 42 double-strand yarn from England, according to the market price of Shanghai silver plate, 350 taels per package, but it will arrive in two months. Therefore, those who spin double-strand yarn in domestic yarn factories are raising the price to 400 taels per package, which is a bit too much. It takes 370 catties of American cotton to spin into a package of 42 double-strand yarn. Calculated at 34 taels per picul, the raw material cost is 125 taels and 800 qian, plus processing and paying 80 taels per package, for a total cost of 205 taels and 800 qian per package. In order to promote domestic products, the selling price should be lower than that of British double-strand yarn, at most the same as the British goods. The double-strand yarn of domestic yarn factories currently sold on the market is 400 taels per package, compared to ordering British goods, 350 taels per package. Although there is a difference between spot goods and futures, there should not be a difference of 50 taels. The cotton weaving and knitting industries are a bit ashamed because they are patriotic and do not buy Japanese goods. Those who take the opportunity to make profit are asked to arouse their conscience and reduce the price automatically, otherwise public opinion will impose considerable sanctions.</p>
<p>(Reply) I hope that the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association will formally warn those who sell double-strand yarn from domestic seconds factories. If they do not pay attention, society will impose appropriate sanctions. I also hope that general domestic merchants will not take this opportunity to raise the price of domestic goods. It is thought that domestic merchants, having enthusiastically promoted manufacturing beforehand, would certainly not be willing to take advantage of the national crisis to take advantage of the fire.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor, I recently read in the second section of local news on page 4 of your newspaper dated October 12, that there were "Twelve Robbery Cases" and that the Xinzha Police Station's Chinese detective arrested the bandits Yan Haosong (i.e., Sun Zhongcai), etc. In the tenth case, the largest amount was robbed from Wang Xufu at 12 ½ Beijing Road, with a loss of banknotes and gold bars worth more than 92,500 yuan. Upon investigation, this case involved goods transported from Zhenjiang and other places by the Datui Transport Company on behalf of Hakka people in March of the Republic of China, and was not owned by individuals. Fearing entanglement, I am writing to request that your newspaper make a correction. I hope this is done. Sincerely, Wang Xufu, October 12.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I read today's (11th) local news in your newspaper, which contained an article entitled "Tea Servant Injured Fingers Picking Up Can of Explosives," which stated that a tea servant of a certain mansion was walking past the entrance of the Nanjing Grand Theater on Avenue Edward VII when he caught sight of a can resembling a cigarette can by the roadside, picked it up, and it suddenly exploded with a bang, immediately causing injuries, etc. Upon investigation, the facts do not match the situation. The iron can did not explode in front of our theater, nor was it picked up on Avenue Edward VII. The incident occurred in front of a mansion on McCao Baolu Road. Fearing that people may be mistaken, I have written this letter to request a correction. Sincerely, Nanjing Grand Theater, October 11.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I read the "Great China Rubber Factory" case in today's newspaper, which mentioned the resolution on the handling method and unsealing, etc. It does not match the resolution of the seventh regular meeting of our association. Please correct it. Sincerely, Secretariat of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I read the report in your newspaper on the 8th of this month about the theft case at Dakura Warehouse, stating that after the Water Patrol Team arrested Zhu Haifan of Yicheng Hang, they went to the Fengtai Grain Store and arrested Zhu Haishan, Wu Zhumei, etc. At that time, Zhu Haishan knew that the matter had been revealed, so he handed over four bags of sandalwood. After reading it, I was shocked. Upon investigation, Zhu Haifan did not have any sandalwood stored in our store. The Water Patrol Team sent people to our store to check that day, but did not obtain any evidence. How could Zhu Haishan hand over four bags of sandalwood? Moreover, the police from the Shenxiangge Second District and First Branch who came to investigate that day can testify. Fearing that the outside world is unclear, I hope you will make a correction on our behalf. Sincerely, Fengtai Grain Store, October 9.</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>Recent Japanese Dream-Inducing Delusions</h3>
<p>By Li Zongwu</p>
<p>"…The diplomatic situation between China and Japan is becoming increasingly urgent and tense. However, due to traditional relations and diplomatic animosity, many of our countrymen disregard Japanese culture, leading them to be unwilling to study the true image of the new Japan. Such utter disregard is inappropriate. Moreover, it is especially necessary to have a deep understanding of the other party's situation in this tense diplomatic situation. Knowing yourself and your enemy, you will be victorious in every battle. This is an ancient saying. Therefore, we must pay special attention to the progress of the new Japan and all the actual situations of its recent politics, education, military strength, and finance…"</p>
<p>These are a few words spoken by the author in the first chapter of this book, in the section "Japan After the Meiji Restoration." Now, Japan disregards public opinion, destroys peace, sends heavy troops to invade and occupy our Northeast Provinces, brutally slaughters countless of our compatriots, and destroys all political, cultural, and transportation institutions in our Northeast. Looking to the future, the disaster of national subjugation and racial extermination is almost upon us. Yet, many of our people are still unaware. This, besides causing us sorrow and grief, makes it impossible for us not to heed the author's words above, and we must especially and particularly study and pay attention to everything about Japan.</p>
<p>Amidst the recent calls to resist Japan and save the nation, most intellectuals have advocated for intensified study of Japan. Although this is like mending the fold after the sheep have been lost and seeing the hare before considering the hound, undertaking the work of "mending the fold" and "securing the dog" may indeed make people feel it is "late." However, it is ultimately a crucial task for resisting Japan and saving the nation. Given the vastness of our country and the size of our population, if everyone could understand the poverty and weakness of our nation and the strength and prosperity of Japan, and thus realize the need to unite, revitalize, learn from others' strengths, and make up for our weaknesses, then even if we are currently humiliated, our territory is seized, and our compatriots are slaughtered, who knows if our motherland will not have the opportunity for strength and revenge in the future?</p>
<p>With this purpose in mind, the reporter is willing, at this moment when compatriots across the country are filled with grief, anger, and hatred, to introduce this book, "Recent Japan," to the readers of this publication.</p>
<p>The book is divided into nine chapters, each chapter further divided into several sections, totaling approximately 100,000 words. It provides an overview of Japan's history, geography, political organization, political party activities, military affairs, diplomacy, culture, finance, and other aspects. Although the reporter feels that some parts are too simple and others too complex, it is nevertheless "a sincere introduction by the author. It is a valuable reading material for those who do not understand Japanese, and it can also save those who do understand Japanese from the trouble of searching for reference books" (as stated in the introduction).</p>
<p>To clarify matters, we will introduce each chapter separately. Chapter One, "Japanese Historical Tales," is divided into three sections: Ancient Japan and Sino-Japanese Communication, Chinese Culture and the Japanese Shogunate System, and Japan After the Meiji Restoration. It allows us to understand how close the relationship between Japan and China is, how backward and corrupt ancient Japanese culture was, and how, due to the Meiji Restoration, Japan was determined to absorb Western civilization and reform all corrupt systems. In just a short 60 years, it has leapt to become a first-class power in the world. On the one hand, this shows the admirable spirit of the Japanese people's upward striving, and on the other hand, it also shows that it is not impossible for a small and weak nation to aspire to self-improvement, it all depends on the determination. From this, we should know what to emulate in our current movement to resist Japan and save the nation.</p>
<p>Chapter Two, "Geography and Population," is divided into two sections. The first section, "A Brief Account of Geography," explains that the topography of Japan is composed of the three islands of Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku, in addition to the areas encompassing Taiwan, Ryukyu, and the former German-owned Pacific Islands, totaling an area of more than 260,000 square miles, only about one-tenth of our country. Its headquarters administrative region is divided into one "do" (circuit), three "fu" (urban prefectures), and forty-three "ken" (prefectures). The next section, "Population Survey," explains that the current population of Japan is more than 83.4 million, with an average annual increase of about 750,000 people in the last five years. Such an increase is truly worrying for the future of our weak and declining China. The day of Tanaka's so-called "making the world know that East Asia is Japan's East Asia" may not be far off. Alas...</p>
<p>Chapter Three, "Overview of the Organization of Japanese Political Institutions," is divided into two sections. The first section, "The Composition of Japanese National Institutions," includes: A. Advisory organs, such as the Genro (elder statesmen) who recommend the prime minister to the emperor, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal who presents political views to the emperor, and the Privy Council, the emperor's highest advisory body. B. Administrative organs, the highest administrative organ of the country is the Cabinet, under which are twelve ministries: Home Affairs, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Navy, Army, Justice, Education, Agriculture and Forestry, Commerce and Industry, Communications, Railways, and Colonial Affairs. In addition, there is the Legislation Bureau, which reviews laws, and other advisory bodies. C. Organs for reporting to the emperor: including the General Staff Headquarters, the Naval General Staff, the Military Council, the Field Marshal's Office, and the Ministers of the Army and Navy. D. Legislative organs, including the House of Peers and the House of Representatives. In addition, there are legislative organs outside the parliament, such as imperial ordinances, cabinet orders, and ministerial orders, whose effectiveness is equal to or even greater than that of laws. E. Judicial organs, divided into courts and prosecutor's offices, which handle all civil and criminal lawsuits. The second section, "The Background of Japanese National Institutions," is divided into A. The Power of the Elder Statesmen in Politics, and B. The Relationship Between Financial Groups Constraining Political Parties and Cabinets.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>It is quite clear and concise.</p>
<p>Chapter Four, "Japanese Political Parties," is divided into seven sections: Introductory Remarks, the Rikken Seiyūkai (Constitutional Association of Political Friendship), the Rikken Minseitō (Constitutional Democratic Party), the Jitsugyo Doshikai (Businessmen's Association), the Kakushin Club (Reform Club), the Meiseikai (Club of Bright Politics), and Proletarian Parties. Each section is further divided into several sub-sections, explaining the establishment, organizational changes, and policies of each political party. Japanese governance is nominally centered on the emperor, but actual political power is held by the cabinet, which is formed by the majority party in parliament. Therefore, the political center of Japan can be said to be based on political parties. Consequently, the complex internal relations of Japanese political parties cannot be fully explained in a single book. This chapter discusses only the general outline.</p>
<p>Chapter Five, "Japanese Military Preparations," is divided into three sections: Recent Conditions of the Army, Recent Conditions of the Navy, and Japan's Air Force. Here, the author tells us how the Japanese conscription system and the content of its organization are, and the number of national army allocations are listed in detail, which is very clear. Japan is originally an island country, so its navy is more complete than its army. The number of its battleships and the tonnage of its draft, if compared with China, are indeed far beyond. No wonder this small country dares to bully us like this. As for the Air Force, it is currently working hard to develop it.</p>
<p>Chapter Six, "Japanese Diplomacy," begins with a brief introduction, generally stating that Japan has become a first-class power in the world in recent years, thanks in no small part to the power of diplomacy. The next section, "Japan's Policy Towards China in the Last Twenty Years," describes Japan's oppression of China, such as the Twenty-One Demands, the Shandong Question, the May Thirtieth Incident, and the construction of other unequal treaties, which are brutal, unreasonable, and extremely deceitful to us. The third section, "Trends in Japanese-American Diplomacy," the fourth section, "New Trends in Anglo-Japanese Relations," and the fifth section, "Recent Conditions of Japanese-Russian Relations," explain Japan's recent relationship with European and American powers, making good use of opportunities to achieve diplomatic victories, which is indeed worthy of emulation in our Chinese diplomacy.</p>
<p>Chapter Seven, "Japanese Education," although Japan's territory is small, the development of education, the establishment of schools, and the large number of students are beyond our reach. This chapter describes a lot, accounting for almost one-third of the book. The author emphasizes this education, which can be seen here. Among them, the educational administration, school education, and social education in Japan are described, which can be used as our reference. Chapter Eight, "Overview of Finance," provides a general description of the changes in the Japanese economy, the development of financial institutions such as banks, the evolution of currency, as well as the current financial panic, production restrictions, and the crisis of capital concentration.</p>
<p>Chapter Nine, "Japan's Policy of Aggression Against Manchuria and Mongolia," briefly describes the process of Japan's aggression against Manchuria and Mongolia, listing many treaties that have lost the country and land over the years, the reality of Japan's aggression against Manchuria and Mongolia, the establishment of railways, the construction of military ports, the monopoly of various industries, and Japan's recent plan to attack Manchuria and Mongolia. After reading it, we are truly worried about our Manchuria and Mongolia, no, for the future of our China. Judging from Japan's recent military actions in the Northeast, its motives have been long-standing. It is not a great pity that our people and authorities are unaware of this and do not prepare for it in advance?</p>
<p>Looking at the whole book, it gives a general description of recent Japan in terms of politics, economy, and culture, which is commendable, and the last chapter is even more of a lesson for us. The author wrote this book in 1930, at which time the Japanese plan to annex Manchuria and Mongolia already existed: 1. Annex it by force; 2. Make Manchuria and Mongolia a Japanese-ruled country; 3. Support Emperor Puyi and Japan control the real power. Therefore, the author shouted at the end, "If the Chinese people do not rise up to resist, Manchuria and Mongolia will become Korea in the shortest time. Alas, China will sink little by little from now on. Compatriots, rise up and save yourselves!"</p>
<p>Indeed, a year later, Japan's plan to annex Manchuria and Mongolia has been put into practice. The military annexation of the three northeastern provinces has now been twenty days. The voices of supporting Puyi as emperor, organizing the Neutral Country, and supporting the independence of Manchuria and Mongolia have been raging. What will our compatriots do about this? Compatriots, let us rise up and save ourselves! Study Japan, overthrow Japan, and take back the three northeastern provinces. Compatriots, let us never forget these three things.</p>

<h3>Military Training</h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>He ran back to his room from the drill ground, very angry, with a kind of indescribable sadness in his heart. At this time, it was exactly half past five.</p>
<p>In an instant, the strangely unpleasant term "five-minute enthusiasm" appeared in his mind. So he thought about military training and smiled bitterly to himself. "Chinese people never have perseverance," he said.</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>"Japanese soldiers have occupied our Shenyang. Alas, that's terrible." Some classmates who usually didn't read the newspapers were each holding a copy these days, and they could also tell a few words about the Japanese soldiers' atrocities. They seemed to have transformed into enthusiastic, hot-blooded young people, running around and shaking their heads and sighing whenever they met classmates, always talking about this sad thing.</p>
<p>That night, the bell rang to convene a general meeting of the whole school. The students walked into the auditorium one after another and sat down in order. Usually, it was impossible to convene a general meeting with the effect of that night. The chairs in the auditorium were full, and no one dared to make a sound. The chairman seemed more imposing and easier to deal with than before. Almost everyone had a proposal, such as "economic severance," "declaration of war against Japan," "promoting domestic goods,"... They kept talking, and the secretary was so busy that he was sweating profusely. Finally, someone proposed to implement military training, and it was proposed that military uniforms should be made of domestic goods. So, everyone raised their hands in agreement.</p>
<p>The meeting announced the adjournment, and it was resolved that each person should first pay ten yuan for the military uniform budget. After the meeting, the students prepared the ten yuan.</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>He had only one yuan left on him. He was willing to enthusiastically donate to flood relief efforts everywhere. He hoped that the victims would be rescued from this disaster. The country has not been stable for years, and the general public has suffered a lot. He felt particularly heartbroken about the Japanese people's actions this time. He then thought back to the military training he had received for a few months a few years ago. If it had not been interrupted, everyone might have been able to form a student army and fight the Japanese soldiers with the military knowledge they had now. But because he couldn't maintain it until now, and it had been interrupted for a few years, he had forgotten how many movements there were to shooting. So he felt the need for this military training very much.</p>
<p>In a hurry, he wrote a letter to his family asking for money. Unexpectedly, this time, his family immediately mailed him twenty yuan after receiving his letter. He thought of the difficulty of being a parent when he saw this money order. This time, the letter said that although it was difficult for the family to raise money for a while, they would always lend him what he needed. He couldn't help but feel heartache again. Why did he write a letter to his family asking for twenty yuan?</p>
<p>From then on, he made a decision.</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>"Mr. Ding, what do you think? Today's order is worse than yesterday's. It's really getting worse every day." The squad leader was in charge of ten brothers in the second platoon of the second company. In the first few days, he could still listen to his command, but in the last few days, he gradually became oblivious. He always wanted to talk and laugh during "at ease," and he always ran around when "marching" or "running." It was really too disorderly. The squad leader couldn't think of a way, so he could only sigh as he looked at this group of young brothers. How is your group of brothers doing, he continued to ask Ding.</p>
<p>Ding was him. He was a brother in the first squad of the first platoon, because he was tall and was the frontmost one in the first formation.</p>
<p>He was wearing a newly made military uniform, with leggings tied on his legs, and his face was dignified and contained an angry color. "Squad leader, the brothers in our squad seem to have forgotten that the matter has not been resolved, and Japan sends warships to China every day. They are not as enthusiastic as before. Their hearts have completely changed," he said. The squad leader was called away by his platoon leader from afar.</p>
<p>He ran back to his room, took off his leggings, took off his military uniform, and changed back into his uniform.</p>
<p>After six o'clock, he heard a burst of laughter that he didn't want to hear from the students on their way to the dining hall.</p>
<p>He looked at his military uniform and thought of the twenty yuan money order.</p>
