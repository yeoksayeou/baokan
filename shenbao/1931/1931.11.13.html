<p>時評</p>
<h3>極可駭怪之共管中國論</h3>
<p>嗚呼。世界可駭可怪之謬論。有過於今日共管中國之說者乎。昨日報載日本將進一步向國聯建議共管中國之方法。以爲欲保障和平秩序與尊重國際條約。非此不可此種謬。論在日人利慾薰心。不惜冒世界不大韙。以此利益均霑之邪說。鼓動各國我人固不足異也。乃今日莫斯科之報紙。更載一驚人之說。謂「帝國主義之列强。已默認滿洲建設傀儡政府。而由日本驅策之。十一月十六日。將昭示世界。國聯絲毫不願遏止日本之行動。各大國已商妥瓜分中國之新協定。其言之可駭怪。不更甚於日人之建議耶。如謂俄報故作此挑撥之論。何以適發於日人建議之時。如謂事屬有因。則國聯之向以公正和平爲號召者。世界寗有瓜分人國之土地爲公正。以共管人國之主權求平和者。我又敢决其必無是也。雖然。世界事固有不可以常理測者。國際間離奇變幻之情勢。恒非局外人所能揣測。國聯兩月來。應付此極困難之中日問題。正苦無法以遏止戰禍。維持其世界和平之面目。難保不有人倡此巧妙之論。以爲如此可以名利俱收。前兩日國聯方面。已傳有組織國際警察之議。（今日高魯已有痛闢之談話）蓋已隠隠然略見其端倪矣。如謂此說亦不足信。何以國聯至今迄未有所聲明耶。此足令我國人起極大之懷疑者一也。美國自日本暴行發動後。始終未有明白之表示。至近數日事態更形嚴重。始傳已有一種和平解决之辦法。可不用外交排斥。亦不用經濟抵制。然所謂和平解决之辦法究如何。則又秘不披露。世人固已視爲悶葫蘆矣。乃觀今日美國務卿之聲明。謂「美令道威斯出席會議。需要時與各國代表共商與美國利益或與條約義務有關係之滿洲問題。殊爲有益。」夫我人所盼望於美之早日發言者。爲其能持正義耳。今國務卿對此問題首次之表示。即注意於美國之利益與條約義務。吾人更不知其利益。爲如何利益義務。爲如何義務。悶葫蘆更難打破。此足令我國人起極大之懷疑者二也。</p>
<p>總之此種極可駭怪之共管中國論。雖若毫無根據。然證以近來所發現國際間種種言動。蛛絲馬跡。又未必其遂無絲毫影響。我國人之倚賴國聯與希望美國者。今日亦稍有所覺悟否耶。國聯而果無此存心。其速有以釋我國人之疑。</p>
<h3>怎樣體認田中奏摺（三）</h3>
<p>在提示了日本之所以向外侵略。以及田中侵略我東北積極計劃之所以産生幾個重要概念以後。現在我們應當回到「怎樣體認田中奏摺」本題上來了。</p>
<p>我們應當怎樣體認田中奏摺危害我國家的實質呢。第一。我們且先就經濟的見地來探索。</p>
<p>奏摺之開端曾有說。「所謂滿蒙者。乃奉天吉林黑龍江及内外蒙古是也。廣袤七萬四千里。人口二千八百萬。較我日本帝國國土大逾三倍。…不惟地廣人稀。令人羡慕。其農礦森林等物之豐富。世亦無其匹敵。」由此第一椿事我們可以認定的。即東北誠無異於一座寳庫。貨殖盈野。俯拾即是我們有此寳庫而不善爲防守。當無怪乎國際大盜之由旁觀眼紅進而計劃實行攫奪。他們由經濟方面着手攫奪的計劃是。</p>
<p>（一）反對自由競爭的「貿易主義。」主張「對支權利主義。」以利權培養貿易。以制我國工商業之發達。並抵制西歐。列强勢力之東漸。進一步以「滿蒙」之利權爲司令塔。以攫取我整個國家的利源。更進一步以我國的富源征服印度及南洋各島以及中小亞細亞與歐羅巴。</p>
<p>（二）派多數退伍軍人散入内外蒙。收買土地。墾爲水田。種植食米。盛設牧塲。養殖軍馬及牛畜。以供軍用及食用。如該地之土地多數被其收買。則斯時内外蒙古之領土權。即已實際轉入日人之手。</p>
<p>（三）積極移殖韓民於我東北。由各地之日本信用合作社或銀行。或東拓會社或滿鐡公司通融已入我國籍之韓民以資金。利用其收買我東北水田。以爲其經濟勢力伸張之司令塔。</p>
<p>（四）實行鐡道政策。反對我國建築打通吉海兩路。建築通遼熱河間鐡道。掌握此交通權。以把持内蒙古之水田及畜牧羊毛等出産。并極力擴充羊毛之産額。以求自給自足。并加工製造毛製物輸販於歐美。建築洮南至索倫鐡道。榨壓洮兒河流域之富源以培養南滿鐡道。并以此路侵入内外蒙。以與侵入南蒙古之通遼熱河線南北相呼應。建築長洮鐡道。待此路完成。後再由大賚至洮南。由大賚至安達。由大賚至齊齊哈爾。分展三叉路線。以脅迫西伯利亞鐡路攫取東滿之富源。長洮沿線地廣人稀。土地肥沃。五十年間不下肥料。亦可豐收。此路之部分必然成爲工業農産加工之大區域。如將來吉會路成功。則蒙古及「北滿」之富源可以一直運達東京及大阪。建築吉會鐡路以一直線轉運「滿蒙」之富源。把持吉林之森林。加工製造爲器具。藝術品或化學製紙。每年至少可獲利二千萬元。奪取新邱埋藏十四億噸而質且篤於撫順炭之大炭鑛。抽取煤油。農業肥料化學上各種用藥。以供彼國之用。并販賣於我國。與撫順炭相呼應以征服我全國之工業。奪取牡丹江流域及吉林夾皮溝流域之金鑛與森林。把持敦化地方之農産酒釀製油豆餅等之運費。每年可獲二十餘萬元之純利。綜合木村新邱煤炭及副産物而計。該路每年收入當在八百萬元以上。而又可以取得森林鑛産商業等權。并培養南滿鐡道突破北滿之大富源。建築琿春至海林鐡道以培養吉會路之勢力。挽浦鹽斯港之繁華。就於朝鮮之會寗。利用鏡泊湖水發水電。以控制滿蒙全土之農工動力。并發展彼國王子製紙公司之製紙業。其最大之效能。尤在於打破我國以吉林五常間鐡路。吸收北滿富源經葫蘆島或天津出港之計劃。而使此富源仍從朝鮮之清津港出口。</p>
<p>「鐡道爲經濟之壘堡。」田中誠能切實了解此義。故其在我東北之鐡道計劃。僅就經濟之見地而言。已足以制我國之死命。假如此種鐡道計劃。果眞實現。則茫茫前途。我國經濟寗尙有出路耶。</p>

<h3>英國朝野注意東省事件</h3>
<p>倫敦英國朝野雖注力國内重要問題、但滿洲時局現漸入於英國政治中之最前地位、今日英閣員在全國各處之政治大會中、皆以滿洲問題爲其演說詞中之主要事件、而下院之討論亦注重滿洲事件、曾任外相多年之葛雷子爵、與屢充英國主要代表出席國聯之薛西爾子爵、亦皆對此危及世界和平之爭端、發表重要議論、自由黨曼德在下院辯論英皇訓詞時、切言事態之嚴重、痛斥好戰黷武之政策、並謂凱洛格非戰公約必須維持、如國聯道德上力量不足以使日本改抱正當態度、則渠希望各國當採用杯葛辦法與經濟壓力、曼德言至此、保守黨議員曰、是乃戰爭也、曼德續稱、不如是、則直承認國聯無用耳、渠不主張武力、但以爲經濟與財政上壓力可迫令日本了解世界不許再有戰爭云、前工黨運輸大臣馬利遜亦發議論、表示工黨恐國聯因滿洲問題而失其地位之意、謂此次危險、是眞的、黑暗勢力亦永不睡的、國聯已致其友好之力、冀制止中日戰事、但若干有勢力之英報、則指斥國聯之行爲、渠請英政府勿以此種指斥言論爲然、並望政府勿挫弱日内瓦弭戰工作之勇氣云、工程大臣戈爾在克羅登演說、謂國聯對於滿洲事件之第一責任、在盡力制止流血、第二責任在使爭端不用武力而獲解决、渠以爲國聯良友不願見其最後懲戒見諸實施、亦不願見中國或日本退出國聯、但願得雙方之合作云、内務大臣薩繆爾今日在孟却斯德國聯同志會演說、請中日停止戰爭、謂國人意思、想皆欲勸令中日停戰、各自撤兵討論爭點而解决之、如不得已、提交公斷、同爲國聯會員、應受國聯勸告、並履行非戰公約之義務、廢止戰爭、此種意思、亦文明世界之公意也云、南埠與利物浦之國聯同志會今日亦皆開會議、葛雷子爵發言、謂在未明眞相以前、吾人不能遽下斷語、今之問題、在决定滿洲日軍當道之行動、超過時局所眞正需要者、究至何種程度云、薛西爾在利物浦演說、謂下屆軍縮會議、爲從來未有之最大國際會議、中日困難、僅爲過去若干年中遠東所發生種種困難之一部、而此困難之解决、可爲增進全世界和平最大要素之定云、（十一日路透電）</p>

<p>（柏林）　此間中國使署今日曾發出宣言、内稱、中國雖對於國聯始終信任、並希望能以國聯之斡旋解决滿洲事件、但倘使和平保障一旦破壞、中國自有保境守土之權、决不願再聽任日人在中國境内横行無忌、如近日日人擾亂天津治安、破壞平津交通等舉動也、德國輿論自滿洲事件發生後、即非常注意、今見中國使署之宣言、乃知遠東事變日亟、一般人士恐慌益甚、蓋中日形勢旣十分陰惡、而尙有可懼於此者、即蘇俄顯有捲入漩渦之勢也、將來一旦戰事爆發、蘇俄究將採取何種態度、此爲德人所亟欲知者、報紙方面對於此事皆有深切之討論、而大多意思則全謂倘蘇俄不免捲入戰爭漩渦、則全世界之禍患將不旋踵而至、德國之處境尤爲可慮、蓋德俄國境相毘連、影響最易感覺也、惟據德國大多數報紙之觀察、現在之蘇俄必力求避免戰事、蓋今日之蘇俄實毫無戰爭之準備、即交通一項、整理尙未就緒、中東路之紊亂、尤屬不必諱言之事實云、柏林日報對於蘇俄此後之行動、曾謂得有特别消息、該報稱、蘇俄决不願偏袒任何一方而獲罪他一方、且依照現在形勢而論、蘇俄寗可放棄中東路、决不因日人之挑釁而輕動干戈、因蘇俄領袖輩之見解、覺他人之競爭無關已事、即暫時之榮辱、亦可不計、惟願坐以待時、預料日後世界上一切被壓迫民族、皆須一一來歸也、此外德政府機關報日耳曼尼亞報則贊成中日之直接交涉、謂兵戎與宣傳、皆不足解决滿洲之事變、中日二民族旣屬同種同文、應速棄宿怨而修邦交、始可避免世界同被之危難云、（十一日國民社電）</p>

<p>責任、我曾經記得、當時總理說、自第一次全國代表大會開會以後、就要把黨交給我們黨員的全體、這句話因爲總理當時自己覺得年老、爲革命奮鬭犧牲、不能預知什麽時候離開我們而逝去、所以不能不望同志共同負責、在第一次全國代表大會以前、我們中國革命事業的責任、老實說、是由總理一個人擔負的時候、那時總理看出本黨黨員中、有人不明白革命責任、一切祇靠領袖一個人、這種革命情形、覺得是很危險、所以總理很感慨於自己畢生革命、年已老了、而革命的前途、還没有得到光明、因而有這一段沉痛的話、他託孤的精神、把革命事業、交給全黨同志、使大家知道革命是全黨同志共同的責任、我們在今天回想到這一句話、眞覺得十分的痛心、非常的慙愧、我們在這八年之中、對於總理所交給我們的黨、我們所盡力的有幾何、我們爲國家爲革命、所已盡力者、又有幾何、眞是愈想愈覺得愧對總理、在第一次全國代表大會開幕時、總理親自指導我們、要本黨同志全體均負改組本黨、改造中國的兩大責任、另外還指示我們一個要點、就是要有堅實團結的精神、革命纔不會失敗、總理說、從前本黨不能鞏固的地方、並不是有什麽敵人用大力量來打破我們、完全是由於我們自己破壞自己、全黨的團結力非常渙散、革命常因此失敗、想到這一段話、凡是我們忠實的黨員、心中眞要起萬分的慚愧、總理當時又說、我們革命黨最要緊的、是只有一種精神結合、所謂精神結合、是要我們知道爲黨爲國來負革命的責任、第一要犠牲自由、第二要貢獻能力、我們個人能爲黨而犧牲自由、全黨方能得自由、個人能貢獻所有的能力於黨、而後黨纔有能力、總理指出我們革命黨、到民國十三年還不能成功、就是由於我們只顧個人的自由個人的力量、使黨失去了自由與力量、以至於失敗、這實在是極精確的敎訓、現在我們要反省、是不是能夠像總理所講的做到呢、自從第一次全國代表大會總理領導我們改組本黨、直到第二次全國代表大會以後、幾年中間、犧牲了無數同志、無數將領、無數人民的生命財産、纔能夠統一廣東、完成北伐、到第三次全國代表大會的時候、本黨已經統一全國了、國府建都於南京、代表大會於首都開會、總理交給我們的責任和使命、大體上覺得無愧於心、但是要使革命不受失敗和挫折、無論如何、是要保障總理所苦心創造而遺留下來的中國國民黨、不但要保障、並且還要發揚光大、使日益鞏固、日益充實、這樣才不負總理的遺命、現在我們試想一想、自從第三次全國代表大會以後、到今天、第四次全國代表大會也已開會了、我們究竟成了怎樣的情形、想到此處、眞使我們發生無窮的悲慨、總理生時、有總理領導我們、一般黨員祗要跟了總理來做、總理去世、是要希望有歷史有經騐的先輩同志、秉着總理的敎訓、以領導我們、精誠團結、來努力奮鬥、以完成革命的使命、這樣黨纔有基礎、革命纔有生路、但是在現在這種情形之下、不僅總理所期望於我們的不能達到、抑且在事實上、本黨由三全大會以後、支離破碎、使國民革命的生機、幾乎斷絕、連已經統一了的局面、都不能保全、這樣我們如何對得起總理、如何對得起爲革命而犧牲的先烈、更如何對得起一般爲革命犧牲而渴望本黨解救的民衆、尤其是在現在國難臨頭的時期、横暴的日本、時時刻刻來壓迫我們、東三省的土地主權和行政、幾乎完全在日本重力蹂躪之下、最近天津又發生暴動、背後的指使、是很明顯的、這樣使全國人民天天在悲憤不安之中、一般國民、責備本黨、責備政府、我們自己一加反省、應該怎麽樣感想、總理所期望於我們的、是不是現在這種情况、我們先烈同志、爲革命爲國家民族犧牲、他們所期望於我們的、又是不是現在這種情形呢、我們自己省察一下、眞覺得無以對總理、無以對先烈、無以對全國國民、我們現在要急起直追、就應該知道怎樣改正我們的缺點、恢復本黨的生命、安慰民衆的夙望、來領導國民完成國民革命的使命、代表大會是本黨的最高權力機關、第四次全國代表大會各位代表同志、都要在艱難困苦中、負起領導國民革命的責任、這是大會最重大的使命、我們旣然負了這個使命、就不能不苦心研究、尋出一條光明正當的道路來、我們要研究用方法去得到全國國民的信仰、使一般國民能夠信仰總理的遺敎、實行總理的三民主義、必先要省察自己過去的缺點、和尋求失敗的癥結所在、事實擴在前面、過去的種種、仍不外乎總理所說、我們如不能有團結的精神、則革命一定失敗的那句話、總理諄諄誥誡我們同志的這句話、就是我們立身處世救黨救國的惟一無二指南針、我們中國革命、不是不能成功、祇要能夠團結、無論敵國外患怎麽樣樣嚴重、斷不能與我們的革命精神相抵抗、所以最要緊是在打開一條出路、使本會能確實團結、而後我們可以運用團結的力量、去掃除一切的外患、兄弟鬩牆、外禦其侮、這一句幾千年來的成語、是最確當不易的敎訓、而至今日、尤其覺得有深切的意義、我們現在要抵禦外侮、保障國家、就問自己有没有兄弟鬩牆外禦其侮的精神、處在目前敵國外患壓迫包圍之中、我們來開第四次全國代表大會、要打破困難的重圍、開闢今後的生路、除開確確實實的恢復我們的團結精神造成全黨一致的力量、别無其他的方法、爲了實現團結、我們同志之間、應該什麽都可以犧牲、什麽都可以忍受、大家以總理之心爲心、以國家的利益和革命的利害爲前提、相信没有不可以達到團結的、不過我們負革命救國責任的本黨、要實實在在講團結、則還有一個不可忽略的要素、那就是尊重紀律、如果一個革命的團體、抛棄了紀律、空洞的團結、不但是没有用、其結果還是失敗、所以我們團結本黨、要在紀律之中求團結、否則不是團結本黨、而是敗壞本黨了、（十二日專電）</p>

<p>哈爾濱通訊、日軍無端啓釁、襲擊我洮昻路綫江橋站守軍後、向外宣稱、我軍妨害其修橋工作、并以有計劃之軍事行動、對日軍攻擊此眞欲以隻手掩盡天下耳目也、馬占山於事發之夜、特電哈埠外部特派交涉員鍾毓、述明戰事起因、囑其轉達駐哈各外領、原文如下、「鍾交涉員輯五兄勛鑒、日軍援助張海鵬偪江、行動暴露、已爲不可、掩之事實、本日日軍大部向我猛烈攻擊、日飛機七架、向我防衛區域、往來擲彈轟炸、山砲十八門、火力兇猛、我軍頗受壓迫、日軍蔑視公理、不顧一切、我爲正當防衛、自應極力抵禦、迄今仍在激戰中、上項情况、希兄轉達各國領事爲禱、馬占山微亥印、」自此次戰事發生後、日軍爲坐實其藉口、揑稱黑軍有蘇聯軍官指揮、五日戰爭激烈時、發槍百餘響、均皆準確等語、馬占山爲此通電闢謠云、「頃聞外間風傳、江省有聘用他國人爲敎練官、并有他國接濟軍火情事、純屬子虚、顯係憑空造謠、别有作用、用特鄭重聲明、以明眞相、黑龍江代理主席馬占山啓支」至近日前方戰事、據此地所聞、五日午刻、戰事復發後、日軍運來野砲十八門、隔江岸向我軍猛擊、飛機在空際往來擲炸彈、我黑軍上下受敵、將士雖處於極端壓迫中、仍死力抵禦、二時後張海鵬親督逆軍李子振宋連陞團、張俊卿張俊哲兩騎兵支隊、自泰來進至鎭東、分兩路援應日軍、猛襲黑軍、張俊卿部結木筏、自河套方面欲偷渡過河、爲黑軍騎兵支隊覺察、即於該方邀擊、日軍與張逆部隊合力攻我、惟時我方祗有吳旅一團騎兵、人數尙不滿千、遭逆衆陸空軍圍擊漸臻危境、二時半後適有吳旅騎兵第二團及新編之屯墾軍（暫編黑軍步兵第一旅）先頭隊王團開到、即於大興鎭下車、馳抵前方、加入火線、猛力擊射、遂將敵擊退、日兵死亡四五百名以上、委屍田野、狼狽遁返洮南、是日午後三時半、戰事停歇、我軍查點傷亡、騎兵一團中校張連長陣亡、連副三名亦殉難、死亡土兵百餘、傷者五十餘、第一團奮戰一日、士兵疲餒不堪、至此乃得稍事休息、一方并於江北北方佈置防禦工事、敗退洮南之日軍、乃積極調動長春之長谷旅團、吉林天野旅團、及公主嶺守備隊、人數多至四千、較前兵力增厚三倍、張海鵬亦悉逆衆爲前軀、於五日夜分爲三枝、向我再次攻擊、張海鵬軍自江橋西渡江取達官屯、攻我側面、日軍長谷旅團、由江橋東結木筏取新立屯、迂廻繞道、襲我軍後方、另一枝則自江橋正面攻擊、三時許接觸、日軍以探照燈覓我軍方向、發流光彈瞄射我軍、我軍伏於江濱草葦中竭力抵抗、日方發百數十砲、我軍所築壕壘、半爲砲毁、士兵不能匿、乃伏於水草中還擊、其由達官屯偷渡之張逆部隊、爲苑旅（屯墾軍）擊翻木筏兩隻、逆軍落水逐流而死者無算、因此敗却、惟拂曉時、日飛機十餘架來助攻、投擲百餘磅重量炸彈、我軍顧慮空間、騎兵因多失却聯絡、遂爲日軍所乘、由砲火掩護搭成浮橋、步騎兵以手提機槍爲前鋒、猛衝過橋、同時其由新立屯迂逈之日軍亦到、我軍陣地動搖、不得已遂退却三十五里、止於大興站附近、至十一時許、復由吳旅騎兵往左右翼、砲步兵爲中堅、掩護反攻、吳松山旅長親率在前、士兵殺聲震野、取大包圍式衝進、敵軍爲之氣餒、張海鵬所部蒙匪、首先潰逃、牽動各部、立脚不住、我軍乃個個包圍、施以猛烈攻擊、於河套間將張俊卿一支隊解决繳械、張率親信數十人、突圍浮水而逃、日軍亦爲我軍擊斃甚多、惟仍頑抗待援、其飛機十餘架來投彈破圍、我軍志殲敵冦、故目下仍在激戰中、今日午前十一時許、前方砲火聲隆隆、遠在昻昻溪方面、亦隠隠聞得、因之由哈滿綫逃避來哈者、每次列車、均爲之滿、日飛機四架、并於六日午前十一時四十五分、到昻昻溪偵察、投下炸彈四枚、雖落於荒郊、未曾傷人、顧人心愈爲浮動、午後一二時半、復有日飛機一架、往該站盤旋偵察、至一時許始去、黑垣日僑及韓人、以我軍堅不屈服、慮遭殺戮、皆避匿於日領事館、日領事清水、因馬占山態度嚴正、亦銷聲匿跡、不復敢提抗議、且擬於明日率領僑民、退出黑垣矣、（六日）</p>
<h3>蘇俄陳兵邊境</h3>
<p>▲對日有盤馬彎弓之勢</p>
<p>▲其行動不久即可判明</p>
<p>大陸報云、美國航空家某氏近自庫倫抵滬、據稱蘇俄對於中日爭端、漸露不安之象、觀於在外蒙各要點屯集大軍、可知也、蘇俄現於逼近穿越滿洲鐡路各要地、駐有最新式飛機七隊、外蒙全部有大規模軍事準備之徵象、尤以滿洲里爲最、滿洲里附近之軍隊、以騎兵爲基本隊、其中以蒙兵居多、鐡甲火車十二列、駐於伊爾庫次克、由蘇俄步兵駕駛、備有冬戰用品、附近各堆棧、廣儲軍糧、蒙古之蘇俄人皆抱抗日情感、蘇俄不願束手以觀日本佔有滿洲、軍隊之行動、將以十一月十六日國聯開會之結果爲定云、</p>
<p>字林報一日哈爾濱通訊云、此間日人刋行而未經中國當道核准之俄文報紙、滿載種種蘇俄活動消息、頗引起居民之焦慮、此種消息、雖經俄政府一再否認、而大半人士亦認爲日人之故意製造與宣傳、但此時亦有若干事實、足以令人揣想蘇俄固未嘗不爲應急之準備、倘至必要時、亦將有所動作、如中東路若干重要人員之突然召赴俄京、不能視爲一種尋常事件、又如大批貨車之調往極西之海拉爾與極東之横道河子、準備開赴邊境、足證該路已接到準備隨時運兵之命令、因海拉爾一帶、並無糧食可運、空車停留、其唯一用意、當然備必要時派往邊境之需也、又俄政府雖絕對否認其軍隊在邊境動員之說、但有明白證據、伯力已發出命令、着西伯亞遠東一帶男丁赴就近軍營報名、上星期有某西人自伯力抵哈埠、親見烏蘇里各車站張貼布告、命各地丁壯赴軍隊投効、此舉在實際上無異動員、又在伯力聞人演說、勸人民準備、倘遇日本干涉中東路及蘇俄財産時、則共起保持在東三省之權利、此外又目擊鐡甲車兩列準備開往東省邊境、此時俄軍並非用以與中國相敵、祇爲保護本國財産、倘其目的在抗拒日人、中國似不致梗阻其行動也、蘇俄邊界方面之軍事準備、日本知之甚稔、其遲遲未敢佔據滿洲全境也即以此故、但日本如果出此、必在後兩星期内十一月十六日國聯行政會重行開會之前爲之、上星期内大豆成交數量甚巨、昨日共達千餘車之多一日成交若是之巨、實爲一年來所未有、足證出口商皆恐戰事發作、糧運必爲停頓、故欲在戰釁開始前運貨出境也、衆意後兩星期内、北滿恐難免發生重要事變、惟其性質無人能豫測也、蘇俄必不許他人干涉中東鐡路、若日本决計强迫齊齊哈爾與哈爾濱加入所謂滿洲自治政府、則雙方衝突不知將以何法避免、蓋日人所辦俄文報紙現方作對俄挑釁之宣傳、顯欲激怒俄人也、北滿冬令天氣奇寒、俄人處斯已慣、如果開戰、俄人實較日人占優勢也、</p>
<h3>天津事變續詳</h3>
<p>天津通訊、記者已兩夜未眠、然猶不能不打起精神、從事採記工作、昨日通信、倉卒草就、不料竟因交通遮斷、無法付郵、不得不於今日投寄、兹將續得之消息、草成此篇、以補昨信所未詳焉、（編者按九日通信内容與昨報北平通信大致相同爲節省篇幅計從略）</p>
<p>▲事變發動之補述便衣隊之總機關、設在日租界蓬萊街五號七號兩處、據多數人之談稱、主幹人物爲李際春張璧、然據某公務員所談、則謂此中原因複雜日内當有詳情公佈、聞暴徒總數約三千五百人、與日本駐屯軍司令部早有接洽、故能明目張膽、毫無忌憚、據一位已經覺悟而抛</p>

<p>▲討論停日開工辦法</p>
<p>新時社云、日本在華紗廠同業會、十一日在大阪召集緊急委員會、議决在華全部紗廠、一致减短二成工作後、本埠在滬日紗廠聯合會方面、業已接到此項來電、並於昨日召開緊急會議、討論辦法、大致以自我國各界、一致自動抗日救國以來、首先適當其衝者即爲日紗、在抵制日貨開始時期、我國方面尙有一二奸商、希圖厚利、私向日紗廠定購日紗、故當時日人方面頗爲鎭靜、並添招新工、儘量趕製出品、厥後如日廠華工因愛國心重、自動退出、而我方棉織業對於檢查日貨、又非常認眞、各奸商雖已向日廠定購棉紗、但終因無法偷運、不得不犧牲定洋、與日方解除契約、於是日廠始大起慌張、遂召集聯席會議、討論應付辦法、結果雖均一致主張暫時停工、以待時機、惟此項决議、各廠尙意存觀望、除因華工退出而無法開工者外、其餘尙在勉强掙扎、昨日日紗廠聯合會、自接得大阪來電、决議减短二成工作後、即於當日召集日全滬日紗廠緊急會議、加以愼重考慮、到各廠代表二十餘人、僉以爲於其减短二成工作、不如全部暫行停工、以節開友、否則雖减短二成工作、出品仍無人購買、而開支則依舊無法節省、經到會各日廠代表一致通過、而日本在華紗廠同業會、委員長武居緩藏、昨亦有電致在滬日紗廠聯合會、報告本人已於昨日由大阪啓程來滬、與在滬日紗廠代表討論停工問題、故究於何日宣佈停工、當待武居來滬後决定云、</p>

<h3>日政府議定在華日輪停航辦法</h3>
<p>▲現行日船停班一半</p>
<p>▲沿海日輪減班日本在華商輪、約分兩種、一受政府補助、爲正式班輪、曰命令船、一不受津貼、曰野鷄班、若本埠日郵社·大阪公司·日清公司等、均受日政府補助、而三井·川崎·山下·等輪、則非正班、自抗日事起、除長江綫内日輪、已早停班外、其在南北洋各路者、有一部分非正班日輪、亦已停業、今所留行者、多爲正式班輪、各輪社近以毫無營業、虧耗日甚、且將無法維持、但以有政府補助費、未便擅自停班、遂協議電致東京、請示辦法、兹得確息、日本遞信省、已有復電來滬、命各社在華商輪、不論南北洋各路、一律先行停班一半、其休業各輪、即將職工解散、暫以半年爲期、各輪社奉令後、立即籌辦、大約下星期可以實行、屆時滬上又將有大批華人員工、因而失業矣、</p>
<p>▲中日綫内減船日本郵船會社中日綫内、已先減去筑波丸·泰安丸·二輪、尙留横濱上海班内三船、上海阪神班内四船、近日此路營業、進口貨祇有二成至三成、而出口貨竟至無貨可裝、最近數次、各船祇運麩皮、營業衰落、爲向所未有、且前途殊少希望日郵社會議結果擬將横濱綫減去一輪、阪神綫減去二輪、暫留五船、往來中日、</p>
<p>▲三井祇派一船三井洋行太平洋一路、本有四船往來、今年又添新輪兩艘、行駛北美至中國北部、裝載貨物、今受抵制打擊、華北方面、無貨可裝、僅大連青島兩埠、略有佣脚、故已經議定、本屆冬令、華北赴太平洋輪、祇放一船、已定十二月三日、命箱根山丸行駛、餘皆不來中國矣、</p>
<p>▲運津貨物大減日人指使津亂、即以護僑爲由、調派軍艦至津、形勢十分險惡、近又調巡洋艦八雲號、載大隊陸戰隊、由横須賀出發即日可到、津人益形恐慌、津帮特電滬報告、除食糧等必需品酌量運往外、其他大批貨物、暫行停裝、此電來滬後、本埠運津出口貨、已經大減、洋商輪之到天津者、均至塘沽爲止、不再駛入白河、華商輪之行駛天津者、刻下僅有三艘往來、</p>
<h3>民生艦昨駛首都會操</h3>

<h3>引水人考試昨未舉行</h3>
<p>關於引水人考試、本定昨日舉行、詎臨時突又延期、兹將各情、記述如後、</p>
<p>▲一再展期引水人考試、海軍部迭經該項人員、呈請舉行、以爲收回引水權之張本、惟因事關重要、考時手續組織種種、當有極完善之辦法、方克有效、初次本定於九月本十五日舉行者、改爲十月一日、繼復更延於昨日、又未能實現、</p>
<p>▲延期原因至此次引水人一再改期原因、係前月海軍部方面、又奉令須加入參謀本部·財政部·交通部·會同辦理、以期愼重、遂由上述四部、聯合組織一引水人考試委員會、負責辦理此事、關於疊次考試日期及考試時種種辦法等、亦由該會辦理、惟前定之日期及辦法、均須呈報考試院及考選委員會轉呈國府、俟批准後、始能舉行、而近來時局緊張、外交嚴重、至對於此事、遂無形延擱、此爲未克如期舉行之最大原因也、</p>
<p>▲引水人數此次應考之引水人數、計長江方面（包括上海至漢口）者、共三百二十七華人、南口方面（即上海至銅沙）約四十餘人、惟此叚以外人居多數、而引水最重要工作、莫過於船身入口掉頭停泊碼頭等、昔日吾國人担任此事、人數衆多、歴年以來、以技術帮後、疊次經海關理船廳考試淘汰、現在僅餘一人、誠屬可悲、惟理船廳均爲外人所担任、吾國人出落選、亦良有關係也、</p>
<p>▲各部人員至此次各部所須參加組織引水考試委員會之人員、聞交通部爲上海航政局長奚定謨、技正夏應康、海軍部聞指定該部海道測量局長吳光宗、引水傳習所所長余正興、至學參謀財政兩部及考試院所派之一代表、人選尙未有聞、</p>

<h3>淞澄段測量請撥船隻</h3>
<p>▲並請補助測量經費</p>
<p>向由海關辦理之淞澄段測量權、自經正式移歸海道測量局接管後、海關用爲測量之「專條」·「厘金」·兩船、現已改爲緝私及巡視標誌燈塔之用、故測量局業已呈請海軍部、另行撥調船隻、以供測量之需、又關於淞澄段測量所需經費、自測量局接管後、海關方面所允撥之欵、未能如海關辦理時之數額、故測量局亦已呈請海軍部、轉向財部商酌、速予補助、以便進行云、</p>

<p>李鴻章報仇三年</p>
<p>甲午之役。朝鮮變起。項城奉使彼邦。禍急遄歸。李鴻章督直。掌北洋之軍政。自知海軍無實力。不敢貿然興兵。舉朝紛紜。莫定和戰。時督兵駐鮮境平壤者。爲葉志超聶士成左寳貴衛汝貴四人。兵不滿萬。而又無後援。日廷命大將大鳥圭介領馬步三萬餘人。進逼平壤。守北門之衛汝貴先遁。葉志超爲各軍之統帥。堅不應敵。及日兵攻城。始還擊。兵無鬥志。一戰而潰。聶聞警且戰且退。祗守西門之左寳貴率一千三百餘人。督戰陣亡。李聞警擲筆而起。急電海軍往援。海軍提督丁汝昌。全軍覆没。舉朝震驚。相國翁同和力保吳大徵帶五十營緑營往堵。未戰而潰。祇宋慶一軍尙在抗敵。朝命李爲專使。遄往馬關議和。日相伊籐博文。要索百端。李不爲動。倭奴暗囑浪人。槍擊李頰。和議遂延擱。李臥醫院中。其子伯行侍側。潛然淚下。李怒曰。孺子何示人以懦。余身負重任。雖粉身碎首不足惜。倭奴之聲。欲使余就範耳。一彈之傷。何足懼哉。卒不爲屈。迨和議成。時論責之。其實非李。竊恐尙無此成績也。逾年俄皇加冕大典。各國均派親貴勳臣往賀。李奏請效力往俄。西太后憫其年老。温諭慰之。李泣奏曰。臣受兩宫寵眷。未報涓埃。願親往當有以洩舊日之憤。以窘倭。后爲之動容。乃命李子仲彭爲副。星夜馳往。頗得俄皇青眼。賜賚獨厚。未幾日俄决裂。兵連禍結者數年。李笑謂幕僚曰。一彈之仇。今日始得報復矣。</p>

<p>— 雲間貧俠</p>
<p>張君慶桐。號鳳輝。滬人也。爲前江陰南菁書院高材生。考取同文館。專攻俄文六年。有幹才。對於世界大事。瞭如指上螺紋。楊儒使俄時。由總理衙門奏准派君赴俄。爲使館學生。於交涉各案。多所贊助。與彼國公法大家馬頓。及大文豪托爾斯泰。時相過從。回國後。迭保至道員。民國初元。歷任黑龍江交涉使。恰克圖副都統。曁阿爾泰辦事長官。爲新疆都督楊增新所不慊。遂致罷官。其在俄時。適值日俄戰事。旋因事赴英倫。由駐英俄使館武隨員薩馬華介紹。晤俄公使格拉甫貝恩幹爾篤甫。貝氏久仰君者。見君即引坐。相對一二酬應語。亟發問言。非常簡要。若胸無成竹。並無世界目光者對之。倉猝必無以應。兹將貝氏與君問答之言。追述於後。</p>
<p>貝問曰。日本人此後將何以待中國。君答曰。日人對待中國。大致分二派。一主保全中國。一主保全亞洲。（此言即隠含日本併吞中國之意君。如此立言。隠而不露。頗爲得體。）保全中國者。望中國實行改革。日本在旁助之。收回已失權利。克底自立。其主張保全亞洲一派。以中國陷入白種勢力範圍。日深一日。日本誼屬同種。援美洲屬美洲人之例。必不能坐視白種得志。故兹後日本在中國擴張勢力之心。當比别國更爲熟切。其用策亦當比别國更爲陰辣。前一派道德主義。附之者少。後十派功利主義。附之者多。觀其處置韓國。已可概見。惟中國情勢較複雜。此派正躊躇辦法。且觀日俄戰後。中國所受影響何如。倘進步甚速。則此後改從第一派。亦未可知。</p>
<p>貝又問曰。中國人將何以待日本。答曰。人謂日俄戰後。中國政府。將舉國聽命於日本。此說甚浮。蓋政府以韓爲前車。寒心者多。而日本之悍然處置韓事。絶不顧忌别國。尤不顧忌中國。其視吾中國已不能脫日本之束縛。此更爲中國上下明白人所痛心。以余揣之。中日交誼。當有變動。觀近日東京中國留學生及中國報。漸多不滿之言。已可概見。且日本旣得志。其待中國眞面目。必漸透露。總之中國人待日本。或者視日俄未戰以前。比畏俄忌俄更甚。或曰。處置韓事辣手段。所以警覺吾政府。此是日本人好意。余深祝斯言之幸中也。</p>
<p>貝又問曰。日俄戰時。中國人何以多偏助日本。答曰。俄諺亦云。種瓜得瓜。種豆得豆。。日俄未戰以前。日本人待中國。貌厚情深。上下一致。其得力處尤在報紙。實則日本欲報俄阻遼東之仇。非先聯絡中國不可。而貴國對付中國。全仗兵力。不知槍砲之外。尙有他策。亦何怪中國人之多偏助日本哉。</p>
<h3>學生義勇軍檢閱記</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>上海各大學曁專科學校之義勇軍。係分區檢閱者。滬南滬東各校劃爲第四區。於十一月十一日上午九時。假西門大林路市一體育塲。舉行檢閱典禮。並假市一塲辦公室對過檯球塲。爲招待長官休憩處。用記鱗爪。以徵各學生英勇之氣也。</p>
<p>到場長官。有張岳軍市長代表。市黨部代表。學生義勇軍訓練主任王柏齡氏代表。及各界來賓若干人。十一日上午。天適微雨。自舉行儀式至檢閱告竣。未嘗中止。由貧兒院軍樂隊奏樂。維護秩序。義勇軍自任之。予距主席臺較遠。要人之訓話。未能盡聆。頗以爲憾。全塲泥水淋漓。足力不健者。輙不堪舉步。而男女義勇軍。精神飽滿。人人具赳赳武夫之氣概。不爲霖雨侵凌而屈服。殊足多矣。</p>
<p>參加學校有同濟大學。震旦大學。上海法政學院。上海美專。東亞體專。同德醫專。中國醫學院。中國體育。兩江體育等校。携槍者祇兩江一校。演習時技巧亦獨多。震旦服裝最美觀。步伐亦整齊有序。美專女看護隊。長髮垂肩。似大脫藝術家本色。法政女義勇軍多矮而肥者。隊伍靠近塲左。污泥亦特深。没踁寸許者。比比皆是。有一女生。革履脫扣。深陷污泥不能拔。而司令者忽於此時高喊開步走。某女生爲之窘甚。而衣黄色灰色布質戎裝者。浸濕兼及内衣。蒼蒼者亦惡作劇矣。</p>
<p>隨由各機關代表。親繞場地一周。分隊檢閱。足跡止處。則各該隊樂聲大作。而代表亦還禮不迭。於此須臾光陰内。極盡赫赫威嚴。檢閱竣事。亦不分别優劣。猶待總檢閱後。始加以褒貶云。</p>
<h3>倭窟述聞</h3>
<p>— 棲鳳樓主</p>
<p>自暴日强佔東省。五旬於兹矣。彼之暴舉妄行。直類猰犬。凡有血氣。罔不痛心疾首。雖經國聯令彼限期撤兵。竟置不理。且近更提出條件。迫我承認。是誠變本加厲。益趨兇惡。我中華固猶未亡。迺一任醜類猖獗若此。誠令人切齡悲憤者也。雖然。倭奴謀我東北滿蒙之心。固非旦夕間之事。其他姑置勿論。即以彼極微之事。已可覘得其侵略之埜心。與不正之盜念。嘗聞彼小學敎員授課之頃。在黑板上繪香蕉福桔等。以示諸生。並詰之曰。汝輩欲食香蕉乎。欲食福桔乎。幼童何知。當然欣諾。敎員乃銳聲曰。香蕉和福桔。皆産自支那之廣東·福建·等處。待若儕長成後。儘可向目的地去飽啖耳。噫。倭人對於童豎。已先盡量灌輸其侵奪之惡念。其用心之險毒。誠可誅也。</p>
<p>民衆痛恨暴日之横行。僉以抵制日貨。以救危亡。此確爲無形之槍砲。而收效殊大。蓋日本産品。全恃運銷吾國全境。頃據友人談及。日本操海産工作者。達二十萬之衆。平均每名每日工資爲五角。則二十萬人每日需十萬金矣。兹以吾國抵制不進日貨。此二十萬人已泰半失業云云。然此猶指一業而言。其數已足驚人。苟國人將飲食服用一切物品。下一决心。作永久之抵拒。二三年後。其不能置倭人於絕境者。吾不信也。故謔者謂中華譬諸仁厚之長者。日本迺不肖之稚子。夙者全恃長者撫育提携。今乃忘恩負義以德報怨。是豈人子之道。其言雖趣。要不無至理存焉　　▲啓事　十一晚東亞諶府盛會之後。鄙人錯携呢帽一頂。惟人佳我劣。未敢掠美。爾日嘉賓中。如有發覺冠被易去者。請至仁記路三十五號友聯影片公司述明該帽牌號圖記。當必得原璧歸趙之喜也。徐碧波啓</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>▲三對孿生子英國愛塞克Essex府的海特利鎭Hahleigh中。有一座禮拜堂。是每禮拜日鎭中士女們做禮拜的所在。這禮拜堂的歌樂班中。有三對兄弟。司按琴歌唱之職。都是孿生的。每一對兄弟的面貌。長得一模一樣。做禮拜的人都以爲奇觀。</p>
<p>▲海底攝影意大利箕奴亞Genoa城的附近。有一班研究海洋學的專家。在那邊的海底做探討的工作。他們能在海面九百英尺以下攝影。攝取海底種種的動植物。極光怪陸離之致。據說所得很多。可爲博物院中的好材料。</p>
<p>▲文身的風氣東西各國的水手和水兵們。都喜在身上臂上刺花。萬一在海中遇了意外。可作一種辨認的標記。這種文身的風氣。在埃及尤爲盛行。至今不衰。那邊的男女都喜文身。或作愛情的厭勝。或表示本人在社會上的地位。或用作消災解厄却病延年的符籙。</p>
<h3>睇嚮齋逞談▲汪兆銘</h3>
<p>— 甘鏐</p>
<p>昔之談革命者。無不及汪兆銘。今之言黨治者。無不及汪兆銘。則兆銘之於國家。固未嘗不負人望也。兆銘。字精衛。浙之山陰人。父某嘗游幕於粤。家於番禺。因寄籍焉。自幼聰頴懷大志。喜讀書。過目成誦。稍長。學於日本。識中山於東京。中山奇其才。恒就其密議滅滿復漢事。兆銘曰。清政不修久矣。邇且三歲小孩爲帝。不亡何待。中山韙之。遂入同盟會。與章太炎（炳麟）共任民報撰述。爲文痛斥清政之失。輒娓娓數千言。宣統末造。偕黄復生（樹中）潛入北都。稅屋而居。詭稱商人。足不出户。二人暗埋地雷。謀炸攝政王載澧。事洩。繫入法部獄。法部尙書廷杰議處以極刑。肅親王善耆方筦民政部。力持不可。謂革命黨人遍天下。旦夕且暴發。兆銘文人無能爲。不若久錮。徐訊其黨之秘計。即不能盡得其實。得其半或一二。足以資戒備。廷杰動容。許焉。善耆以語廷杰者復語載澧。載澧亦謂然。兆銘得不死。辛亥變作。出獄。知袁世凱舊部皆握兵符。行將起用。約其子克定偕往洹上。見世凱。責以大義。動以輿情。謂逐幼帝。滅清廷。改建民主共和政體。此其時矣。世凱感其誠。隠衷稍稍吐。兆銘乃南歸。歸而參與南北和議。迨臨時政府成立於南京。兆銘宣言。不爲官吏。不作議員。相織六不會。有六不規約。蓋其時廣東省人方舉其爲粤督。政府復將大用之也。臨時參議院旣因中山一言。選舉世凱爲臨時總統。中山立遣兆銘及蔡元培等北上迓之。世凱慮有變。憚南行。陰使心腹第三鎭曹錕所部譁變。焚掠京津。藉口北方無人坐鎭。元首宜緩行。政府應北遷。其間經過種種。人人能道。不贅。當世凱之得膺臨時總統之選也。兆銘力爲多。非如此。則南北必久戰爭。清帝遜位將無期。統一之局莫由成立。世凱死後。北軍勢漸衰。年復一年。一蹶不振。比且根本不存。近數年間兆銘始入黨國政府。嗣以政見不合而退。好作政論。尤喜談法理。爲白話體。衰然成集。間爲詩。詩亦警闢肖其爲人。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>鄕下人又到上海（十五）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>賣人不知道他的外甥名字就呌阿木林，還是要根問他到那裏？一位乘客說道：</p>
<p>「他旣是要到梅蘭芳相近的地方，梅蘭芳現在不是在大舞臺唱戲嗎？你就把他的票子，買到了三馬路，讓他自己到大舞臺去找梅蘭芳好咧。」</p>
<p>賣票人一想：這位先生的話倒也不差。便給了他一張到三馬路下車的票子。　　「碰着這位阿木林，眞正大舞臺對過天曉得。」他一頭走一頭還是這樣咕嚕着。</p>
<p>「嗄！大舞臺對過，還碰得着阿木林嗎？」鄉下人又纒夾了。又想：阿木林說在梅蘭坊，他們又說什麽梅蘭芳在大舞臺，究竟是怎麽一回事？</p>
<p>賣票人這時把一雙手藏在他身上所掛的皮袋裏，還在掏弄他賣下來的銅板。却又顚頭播腦，笑嘻嘻的說道：</p>
<p>「大舞臺對過，還有你老先生的照片咧。」說得同車的人，都哈哈地笑了。　　鄕下人却不懂他們笑的是什麽？但想「怎麽還有我的照片呢？我生平就没有照過相，上次到上海來，也没有照過相。我的兒子阿大，就勸我照一個相。他不知在那裏去聽得來的野話：說是一位將軍，出身是低微的，後來關了，要畫他父親的遺容。畫師請問：「怎樣的畫法？」將軍說：「我的父親没有過照片。」後來就在百像圖上去揀了他一個父親。我說：「呸！你想昏了心，將來要做將軍嗎。」可是阿大的娘，倒在蘇州元妙觀的露天，照過了一個相。大舞臺對過，怎麽會有我的照片？大概面孔相像的，也是有的，我倒要去看看咧。」</p>
<p>正在籌思的時候，忽聽賣票的人，向着開車的人，低低的說道：</p>
<p>「當心！測老來了。」</p>
<p>這句話鄕下人倒明白。他知道江浙一帶的人，稱呼鬼爲測老。現在他們說：「測老來了。」這句話不是明明地說：有鬼來了。但是在這青天白日之下，繁華熱閙之區，那裏會有鬼出現呢？他們却說測老來了，我倒要放大了膽子，看看是怎樣的一個測老？</p>
<p>不一會兒，果然走上了一個黑面孔，黑皮膚，黑手黑脚的測老。</p>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>十月三十日、加特諾司令指定第十軍在格萊末西森林之北作戰、第八軍在倍常奇森林之南作戰、加特諾司令認爲這兩軍兵力相等、遂這樣佈置、但最高司令曾把他的計劃略加修正、第十軍在梅慈河方面馬受側面襲擊、必須大隊兵力以資掩護、</p>
<p>十一月五日、貝當司令便把這修正之點通知加特諾司令、次日、佈置妥當、</p>

<p>貝當司令雖表示要美軍十二師歸他支配（四師在梅慈河方面掩護第十軍、、六師或八師參加進攻、）但實際上不能有如許美軍供他調遣、况且我軍很注意勞倫攻勢戰的從速開始、因兵力的多寡不及作戰的機會的重要、惟仍竭力把充分的美軍供給貝當司令、一面先俟美第一軍開到苗斯河後即縮短其陣綫抽調幾師、一面我請潘興司令抽調美後備軍六師、（未完）</p>

<h3>紙老虎</h3>
<p>— 雯卿</p>
<p>玉清八月初七日離開漢口省立女子中學、十一日早上就到了洋鬼所崇拜的上海了、她想直接考進一個國立大學、後來、因爲有兩門科學没有及格、不幸名落西山了、她在某大學的宿舍住了一個星期、又過了一些日時、她的老師寫信給她、就是介紹她在上海西路一個很有聲名的女子中學的高中部、補習一個學期、再去投考、那也許對於學英語是一日有千里之功的、她得了老師的介紹信、就馬上跑去找了一分章程、並且、探聽了學校裏的一個大概情形、聽說這學校有六七百名女學生、在她的意想中學校一定辦得很好、設備也許如章程上一樣的完善、因此、她已决定住這個學校了、在一個星期六的午後、她先去繳了八十五元的費子、就搬進學校裏去了、</p>
<p>昨天正午接她一封短短的來信、報告她患熱瘟症、睡在床上已有兩天没有起來、我得了這封信、心中莫名其妙的有些顫慄、這是心境太虚空了的原故吧、因爲是在幾天以前、一位同學窮死了、並且還有個女朋友没有出醫院、現在一個唯一的同鄕妹妹又病了、一個異鄕的游子、睡在客土的病榻上輾轉吟呻、那是比飲黄蓮湯還要苦的呀、這都是我自己嘗夠了的滋味呵、於是、我即刻鎖上了房門、一直跑到英租界去看她、經了很久的時候、才找得她的學校、我一走進她的寢室、便使我十分詫異、怎樣一面小小的房子裏、要放十六張鐡床呢、那些小床像溪邊的小漁划子一樣、身近身的排着、寢室裏不但只有玉清睡在床上、並且還有兩三個同學陪着她吟呻、那眞像一個醫院裹的三等病房、不、三等病房裏也許還没這末多的床舗吧、</p>
<p>一個六七百名學生學校、没有校醫、、這眞是對於學生太刻薄了、有時學生睡在床上兩天、學校裏的當局還不知道、若是知道了、也就只有把學生往醫院裏拖、没有錢進醫院的窮學生、也只好讓張她着眼睛病死、</p>
<p>我坐在玉清的床沿、問了她的病症、她說身體上的熱已完全退了、不過有些四肢軟弱無力、她又落了幾點眼淚在枕邊、便緊緊地握着我的手、把她們學校裏的内容、一五一十的告訴我、</p>
<p>她們的校長、是在南京一個著名的敎會大學、讀了兩年書的老處女、她的學問呢、除了把英語聖經念得很純熟而外、就是寫一張什麽收條、也要請國文先生帮忙的、學校裏的經費、到也很豐富、每學期差不多要收學生們五千多元的學膳宿費、除了校長自己住有花園的、三層高大洋房的公館、和吃西餐、進外國華貴的跳舞塲以外、那些錢似乎没有别的用處、因爲學校裏不要發出多少薪水、本校的高中畢業生、可以敎高一高二的功課、她們稍微有點服務的性質、學校方面給一點生活費也就夠了、其他的敎員、都是校長所親信的、僅僅能念幾句洋文的朋友們來帮她的忙、高中部、除了國文一科以外、其他的各種科學、都是用英語原文、有人問校長爲什麽不採用翻譯的課本、她說請不到好敎員、難道在這個文化區域人材擠擠的上海、聘不倒好敎員嗎、眞是騙三歲的小孩子、他也不會相信的呵、</p>
<p>敎原文的敎員、又何嘗有一個好的、就只請一位敎幾何的敎員、他每每上了堂、把定理念一遍、拿起兩角規、把黑板上劃一個大圓圈、不時用手指摸擦白圈的線條、有時雙手垂下、目光死死地釘着黑板上的圓圈、好像是在上帝的面前祈禱一樣的虔誠、滿堂學生只是眼睜睜地望着他的背、有些性急的學生說、</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>「先生、你快點講吧」</p>
<p>「等一等…………」</p>
<p>「已經過了二十五分鐘哩、」</p>
<p>「好、今天你們自己去預備吧、我明天再來替你們講定理……」</p>
<p>他說了、便把手中握着的粉條輕輕地放在講桌上、安安靜靜地坐在一把黄漆椅子上、把一本硬壳子幾何書、翻來翻去、學生在下面、有的做手工、有的看小說、有的織編物、有的談白話、有時、他還干涉學生、</p>
<p>「你們不要談話、」</p>
<p>「先生、你們不談話、做什麽事情呢」</p>
<p>「你們看、她們也在各做各的事、你們没有事做、講話也應當低聲些、要是校長來聽見了、一定要處罰你們的、」</p>
<p>「學生該死先生該生……」</p>
<p>一個坐在最后一排的汪女士說了、幾何敎員的眼中閃爍怒火、但畢竟没有爆發出來、</p>
<p>那位校長、眞是一個經濟大家、學校裏的房子多半是有兩三種用處、靠東邊一間比較大一點的房子、要做禮堂、做食堂、也要做自修室、這間屋子裏排的桌子、是校長獨出心裁要木匠做的、桌子正方形的面積有二尺寬、爲了要適合面積的比例、桌腿用一尺五寸高、小得怪有趣的、無論在什麽地方、也找不出這種樣式的桌子來、若是普通的桌子、那房子裏只能放下三十張、那末、小桌子就可以放四十五張了、學生們會餐的時候、都是背抵背的坐着、若是到了暑天、甲生背上流出的汗水、可以浸透乙生的衣服、因爲桌子太矮的原故、學生們彎着腰背吃飯、一個個像蝦子、桌子中央排了四碗小菜和一碗湯、旁邊就没有許多空餘的地方放飯碗了、因此、學生常常打破飯碗、自然打破飯碗是學生們的損失、同時也是學校當局的利益、因爲學生打破了八個銅板一個的飯碗、學生要賠償兩角小洋、那末、每個飯碗不是可以賺四十個銅板嗎、若是學生們每天可以打破十個飯碗哩、學校裏的電燈費、也很豐裕了、</p>
<p>聽說這個學校是在敎育部立過案的、所以比較其他的女校要有地位些、最容易號招學生的空招牌、就是學校的洋文還好、在高中畢業的學生、雖然寫不通中文信札、但至少也能講幾句時髦的英語、</p>
<p>校長對於學生、還有一個優待的特例、對於新學生、只要有錢、不必經過考試、便可以搬進學校去住、學生上課也好、不上課也好、只要錢得到手了、像這種辦法、一個學校裏能容六七百名學生、這也不算一會怪的事吧、</p>
<p>由此、可以知道這個學校、完全是一個紙糊的老虎、在表面上看來、牠是威風凛凛的、若是把紙老虎、用指頭撮破了、才知道内面是空空如也、像這種敎育大家、爲了個人的福利、不知害了多少青年的女同胞、我不禁爲她們一嘆、</p>

<p>A Japanese Cavalry Unit's Sneak Attack Fails, Followed by a Large-Scale Encirclement</p>
<p>Cheng's Brigade Advances to the Front Lines to Reinforce; Four Japanese Scouts Killed</p>
<p>(Harbin) Today at approximately 1:00 PM, over 500 Japanese troops, divided into groups of ten, attacked our Jiangqiao area and strafed our positions with machine guns. Our army countered, repelling the enemy at 1:40 PM. At 2:15 PM, over 6,000 Japanese infantry and artillery launched a large-scale assault, employing an encirclement tactic against our positions at Sanjianfang, Xinlitun, and Daxing Station. Japanese Army Major Generals Tani Brigade Commander and Amano Brigade Commander, respectively commanded the left and right wings, while Garrison Commander Mori commanded the front, pressing our troops from three directions. The battle is currently intense. The Japanese heavy artillery regiment, supported by seven aircraft, is fiercely shelling our right flank held by Wu's Brigade. Our army has already transferred troops from the second and third lines of defense to reinforce the front lines. Ma Zhanshan has ordered Cheng Zhiyuan's brigade to Jiangqiao. Cheng's forces arrived in Hailar this afternoon and are expected to reach the front lines tonight. Loud artillery fire was heard from the front lines between Ang'angxi and the front lines. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Two Japanese aircraft arrived in Jingxing this afternoon to reconnoiter for half an hour before flying away. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the 11th, Japanese officers held a meeting in Tailai, chaired by Lieutenant General Tamon, to finalize all plans. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 4:00 PM on the 11th, four Japanese scouts, led by a lieutenant, attempted to scout our positions and were killed by Chief of Staff Zhang of the 1st Cavalry Brigade. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Japanese troops who invaded Emu County retreated to Jilin on the 10th. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Two thousand Japanese troops, supported by several aircraft, attacked Heigangzi at 1:30 PM this afternoon. Our two regiments are resisting with all their might and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. Cheng's Brigade of the Heilongjiang Army is being transferred from Ang'angxi tonight to reinforce that area. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) One Japanese aircraft flew to Xiaoshaoshan on the Harbin-Manzhouli railway line at 2:00 PM this afternoon to reconnoiter and dropped four bombs, killing three garrison horses. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 2:00 AM on the 11th, over 600 Japanese cavalry troops launched a sneak attack on the first line of defense at Jiangqiao, but were detected by our army. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy retreated. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) A Japanese aircraft arrived in Ang'angxi this afternoon to reconnoiter but was driven away by our artillery fire. After leaving Ang'angxi, it flew to Fularji and dropped five bombs on our troops, but none hit. Two hours later, it returned to Ang'angxi for a lengthy reconnaissance before flying away. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The All-Manchuria Japanese Reservists Association held a meeting, demanding that the Kwantung Army Commander quickly advance troops to Heilongjiang. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 3:00 PM on the 11th, a Japanese aircraft dropped over twenty bombs on the right wing of our army's defensive line at Jiangqiao and Sanjianfang, causing no casualties. Military telephones have been installed on the defense lines of Jiangqiao, Fularji, and Heigangzi to connect with the Ang'angxi headquarters. The Heilongjiang army has plenty of ammunition left over from Wu Junsheng's tenure as military governor, which is currently sufficient. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese troops who attacked Jingxing and Heigangzi were repelled by our army at 3:00 PM on the 11th. Our army suffered the loss of one company commander and fourteen soldiers. The Japanese troops have retreated westward to Buxi. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese army is now alternating cavalry units to harass our front at Jiangqiao to wear down our forces, while another detachment is attempting to attack Heilongjiang via Tuquan, Jingxing, and Fularji. However, that area is mostly flat plains, and troops cannot move without being exposed, so our army believes that a successful attack is unlikely. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the Tao'ang Railway front, the Japanese army is fiercely attacking the left wing of our army's defensive line between Sanjiazi and Xinlitun with cavalry and artillery. Our army is firmly defending its positions, and the situation remains unchanged. Since 3:00 PM, the Japanese army has resumed fiercely shelling our positions with explosive shells, heavily damaging our trenches. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to information obtained by Chinese personnel here, the Japanese army has crossed the Chinese Eastern Railway line and is preparing to encircle Qiqihar. This information has not yet been verified. It is reported that last night, a Japanese unit, consisting of 600 infantry and 100 cavalry, advanced towards Jingxing Town, west of Ang'angxi on the southern side of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Japanese unit encountered 100 Chinese police officers and engaged in a small battle. The Chinese police, outnumbered, retreated to the Fularji station on the Chinese Eastern Railway, west of Ang'angxi, approximately twenty miles from Jingxing Town. Two Chinese police officers were killed. Two Japanese aircraft bombed Chinese cavalry who rushed to the aid of the Chinese police, killing four horses. There has been no new developments reported on the Nenjiang front today. It is reported that the Japanese are currently massing troops south of the railway bridge, expecting to continue the attack today or tomorrow. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Officials here today increasingly anticipate the possibility of serious developments in Northern Manchuria, but it is reported that the number of reinforcements may exceed the one brigade previously mentioned. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese military headquarters here issued a public statement tonight stating that the positions of the Chinese army at Ang'angxi have been greatly fortified and that numerous reinforcements, carrying weapons and ammunition, have arrived from the west. It also stated that Chinese cavalry have surrounded the right wing of the Japanese army, creating an extremely dangerous situation. (12th Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Ma Zhanshan Issues a Circular Telegram Declaring No Soviet Russian Aid Received</h3>
<p>◎Ma Zhanshan of Longjiang issues a circular telegram stating, "To all news agencies, please note: Recently, the Japanese side has repeatedly propagated that the Heilongjiang army has secretly colluded with Soviet Russia and is employing Russian instructors, etc. I have solemnly declared that this is absolutely false. I trust that the enlightened within China and abroad will see this clearly. Recently, they have again fabricated claims that Russians have joined our army in battle and that many have been killed in action, which is even more shocking. I have respected the League of Nations' resolutions and strived to avoid military expansion, so I have repeatedly yielded ground. I have never fought with the Japanese army. Later, because the Japanese army pressed ever closer, seemingly determined to directly attack the provincial capital, I, Ma Zhanshan, am responsible for defending the territory and cannot bear to abandon the elders and brothers of my Heilongjiang province. Our beautiful land and mountains would be lost to a foreign race, so I made a decision to defend ourselves, inspire the morale of the local people, and resolutely resist. All those deployed to the front lines are my thousands of officers and soldiers who share weal and woe, sacrificing their lives for the country, which is the duty of us soldiers. There is no request for foreign aid. I, Ma Zhanshan, have always relied on integrity to overcome all obstacles. I hereby solemnly declare again, hoping that friendly countries, heroes and worthies, and enlightened people within the country will understand this situation. I am deeply grateful." Ma Zhanshan.</p>

<p>(Harbin) Ma Zhanshan said to the representatives of the Harbin 慰勞团: "I have a firm purpose. The troops deployed at Jiangqiao and Fularji are sufficient. As long as I have a breath left, I will never hand over our territory. If the army is defeated, I will go to the desolate eastern part of Heilongjiang to train a local militia and fight again. In short, I will definitely be worthy of the Chinese people. I have no problem with letting Chairman Zhang Haipeng go, but it must be with a government order." (12th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Japanese Plainclothes Teams to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>Japanese Protect Zhang Bi to Liaoning</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese are extremely angry that the plainclothes teams they recruited in Tianjin are completely useless. They have expelled the plainclothes teams from the country to let them disappear and are reorganizing them into five teams. The first team will be filled by the Japanese themselves, the second team will be staffed by Koreans, and the third, fourth, and fifth teams will be organized by recruited Chinese. The team members are mostly rickshaw pullers, tea servers, and kiln workers from the Japanese Concession. They are gathered in the International Apartment, each person is given a large gun, twelve bullets, and is paid eight yuan in cash per day. The code is the six characters "New China Dominates the World," and they are prepared to act in a timely manner. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Situation Slightly Eases</h3>
<p>British and French Concessions Implement Joint Defense; U.S. Troops Reinforce and Dig Trenches</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Because the Japanese army's secret support of the plainclothes teams' three general offensives has failed, the situation on the 12th has eased. However, the British and French authorities implemented a joint defense on the 12th. The U.S. commander dispatched a team of U.S. troops to defend Special District One on the night of the 12th to protect Chinese and foreign people. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Public Security Bureau announced on the morning of the 12th that plainclothes teams who surrender with their weapons will not be punished and will be rewarded with ten yuan. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Chinese area and the Japanese Concession are now engaged in building defensive works. Nearby villages are also doing this work. According to the villagers, this is to prevent bandit attacks. About 200 students from Nankai University suddenly went to Beiping, and the remaining students will follow as soon as possible, to guard against the outbreak of war. It has been learned from a key Tianjin source that Chinese and Japanese authorities have reached an understanding that will allow the situation in Tianjin to be quiet within fourteen hours, but the details are unknown. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Apart from the gunfire that occurred in the early morning, today has been very quiet, but people are still uneasy. The authorities of the various concessions are consolidating their defenses. Tonight, officials announced that the Chinese and Japanese authorities have agreed to allow Chinese troops to re-enter the neutral area of 300 meters between the Japanese Concession and the Chinese area to carry out suppression work. The Chinese side has arranged everything, but this work may not begin before dawn tomorrow. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from a certain aspect in Beiping on the 11th, stating that according to a telegram from Tianjin, at 1:00 PM on the 11th, a Japanese mountain gun shrapnel shell was found on the earthen wall behind the Tonghecheng Dyeing Workshop at No. 12 Yanghuo Street in this city. It was fired this morning and was cast in the year 15 of Taisho. The hand grenades seized from the captured plainclothes teams were also engraved with the same mark. Also, at 1:00 PM today, a Japanese warship fired three blank rounds at the station south of Shanhaiguan Nanwan. At 2:30 PM, the Japanese warship No. 16 sailed from Tanggu and fired four shots before docking at the Japanese pier. According to the Japanese Consul in Tianjin on the 11th, the mutual attacks between the Chinese and Japanese sides in the black (of night) were unfortunate. If this continues, it will inevitably lead to war and a solution should be sought.</p>

<p>method, it would be better for both China and Japan to remove all defensive structures to avoid conflict. When we responded that the defensive structures on the Chinese side were set up for the plainclothes teams, it would be difficult to remove them before the plainclothes teams are suppressed. It would be better to have troops from various countries stationed in the neutral location, within 300 meters behind our retreat, so that we would not come into contact. The Japanese Consul agreed, and then the Japanese Consul and the staff of the military affairs department came to discuss a solution and decided that we would send plainclothes police to the Japanese area to watch as a means to prevent the infiltration of the plainclothes teams. The defensive line from the Chinese area to the Japanese Concession will remain the same, and will be removed when the plainclothes teams are suppressed. It was put into practice tonight.

The Bank of Communications, the Bank of China, and other banks have put forward ten million yuan in cash to transport to Beiping for assistance. As of the night of the 12th, five million yuan had been transported to Beiping. The cash reserves of the banks in Tianjin are still sufficient, but the money merchants have closed because transportation is blocked. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wu Ou, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened a joint relief meeting of all sectors at the Banking Association at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 12th and decided: (1) To ask the Red Swastika Society and the Red Cross Society to transport women and children from the Chinese area to the former Daosishu (Old Tao Office) for accommodation, and the Emergency Relief Association will advance funds for relief and then raise donations to repay it. (2) To ask Chen Baoquan and Yan Zhiyi to meet with the Provincial Chairman, ask Deng Qinglan and Liu Mengyang to meet with the Mayor, and quickly contact the consuls to implement a buffer zone between the Chinese and Japanese areas.

<h3>Doihara Kidnaps Puyi to Restore the Qing Dynasty, Shenyang Clothing Shops Rush to Make Dragon Flags</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Doihara has come to Tianjin, bribed Chinese ruffians, and supplied them with weapons to disrupt the security of Tianjin in order to establish a new government under Japanese protection. This plan has failed, so he has decided to take further action to force Puyi to go to Shenyang to establish an empire.

<h3>The Pseudo-Government of Liaoning, Presided Over by Yuan Jinkai, is Established</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The Liaoning Provincial Government was established on the 10th under the direction of the Maintenance Association. Yuan Jinkai, member of the Maintenance Association and Provincial Government, is Chairman. (11th Dispatch)</p>

The case lists revenue items for the next fiscal year totaling 22 million yuan, while the current fiscal year is 65 million yuan. The huge reduction is said to be due to the abolition and reduction of several taxes. Expenditure items are 10 million yuan, while the current one is 85 million yuan. Military spending has also been greatly reduced, to only 3 million yuan, while the current one is 76 million yuan. (12th Reuters Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Preparations Well Underway at League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting, Large Map of Dong Province Hung Up, Shi Zhaoji Goes to France Today</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French authorities are determined to make thorough arrangements to facilitate the work of the League of Nations Administrative Council. It is generally believed that the meeting on Monday to deal with the Manchurian issue will be the most important meeting in the history of the League of Nations. French cartographers are currently rushing to produce a very large map of Manchuria to hang in the famous Clock Room of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This room is the room where the Kellogg-Briand Pact was signed and the meeting room of this Administrative Council. In addition, various rooms are being actively arranged to accommodate the secretaries, experts, and journalists of the various representatives, and new telephones are being installed and a special telegraph office is being opened to ensure that news is quickly received. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) With the important meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council about to open, there is some apprehension here about the outcome of the meeting. Some say that the Administrative Council will hesitate to move forward, knowing that public opinion in various countries does not approve of steps that could cause disputes. However, if Dr. Shi, the Chinese representative, raises the issue of Articles 15 and 16 of the Covenant, it will put the Administrative Council in a difficult position. Dr. Shi's recent report, containing the implication that Japan intends to seize Qiqihar, is a topic of conversation for the general public. It is said that the Chinese representative is making a very strong application to the League of Nations on this matter. This news is seen as a serious omen, but the concerns have been slightly alleviated after receiving more optimistic news from Washington. At the same time, the Chinese delegation claimed to have received telegrams from Chinese organizations around the world expressing their determination to boycott Japanese goods. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations deeply hopes that what China is requesting from the Administrative Council will not fail, because it feels that the fate of a moderate and progressive force within China is in danger. If the Administrative Council cannot maintain respect for treaties and the solemnity of international obligations, then the Chinese who are inclined to Western ideas and civilization may be swept away by reactionary tides. The predicament of former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting with students is a sign of this. China is not attaching reservations and will listen to the judgment of the Administrative Council. The attitude of the League of Nations is dominated by this fact. The League of Nations is currently facing an extremely difficult crisis because of Japan's attitude. China's note to Tokyo, asking it to cease fire and ordering it to pay compensation for losses, shows that China has complied with the various proposals of the League of Nations Administrative Council. The guarantee issued by Japan to the U.S. Secretary of State regarding the Manchurian situation is welcome here and hope Japan can keep its word. (12th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received news that Representative Shi Zhaoji is scheduled to go from Geneva to Paris on the 13th. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Stimson Unwilling to Release Japanese Note, U.S. Attitude Provokes Speculation</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Stimson stated today that Ambassador to the UK Dawes has been instructed to attend the League of Nations Council meeting on November 16th. However, Dawes may find it unnecessary to attend the Council meeting. The government instructed him to attend because the US government believes it would be beneficial for Dawes, if deemed necessary, to discuss the Manchurian issue with representatives from various countries in Paris, as it relates to US interests or treaty obligations. Official circles here deeply hope that the Manchurian dispute can be resolved peacefully, without the pressure of diplomatic exclusion or economic boycotts. In the afternoon, Stimson stated that Japanese Ambassador Debuchi had submitted a Japanese document with very mild wording. However, Stimson declined to release the contents of the document, believing that its release might embarrass various countries and hinder the peaceful resolution of the issue. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The news of the US sending Ambassador to the UK Dawes as its representative to attend the Council has been met with great satisfaction here, indicating the US's emphasis on the meeting and a willingness to be more active. Furthermore, Walter, the personal secretary of League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, has arrived in Tokyo and will contact Japanese authorities to report directly to the League of Nations Secretariat. It is widely expected that this trip will shed light on certain issues. Many people are speculating about the United States, raising questions such as: What will the United States say to Japan? How will Japan respond? Is the American note so harsh that the White House is unwilling to release it? Or is the wording of the American note not as forceful as that of other countries? In relation to the American note, what does Dawes's participation in the Council signify? No one can definitively answer these questions. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Extremely Shocking Theory of Joint Administration of China</h3>
<p>Alas! Could there be a more shocking and outrageous fallacy in the world than today's theory of joint administration of China? Yesterday, newspapers reported that Japan would further propose a method of joint administration of China to the League of Nations, arguing that this was necessary to safeguard peace and order and respect international treaties. Such a fallacy stems from the Japanese, blinded by greed and willing to risk universal condemnation, promoting this wicked notion of shared benefits to incite various countries. We are not surprised by this. However, today, a Moscow newspaper carried an even more alarming claim, stating, "The imperialist powers have tacitly approved the establishment of a puppet government in Manchuria, driven by Japan. This will be revealed to the world on November 16th. The League of Nations is unwilling to curb Japan's actions in the slightest. The major powers have agreed on a new pact to divide China." Is this claim not even more shocking than the Japanese proposal? If it is said that the Russian newspaper is deliberately making provocative statements, why did it happen to coincide with the Japanese proposal? If there is a reason behind it, then how can the League of Nations, which has always been known for its fairness and peace, find fairness in dividing another country's territory or seek peace by jointly administering another country's sovereignty? I dare to say that this is impossible. However, there are things in the world that cannot be measured by common sense. The bizarre and ever-changing international situation is often beyond the comprehension of outsiders. The League of Nations has been struggling to cope with the extremely difficult Sino-Japanese issue for the past two months, desperately trying to find a way to curb the war and maintain its image of world peace. It is difficult to guarantee that someone will not advocate this clever theory, believing that this way they can gain both fame and fortune. Two days ago, the League of Nations had already transmitted a proposal to organize an international police force (today, Gao Lu has already made a scathing speech), which vaguely reveals the beginning of this scheme. If it is said that this claim is also not credible, why has the League of Nations not made any statement so far? This is the first thing that makes our countrymen deeply suspicious. Since the outbreak of Japanese atrocities, the United States has consistently refrained from making a clear statement. In recent days, as the situation has become even more serious, it has finally been said that there is a peaceful solution that does not involve diplomatic exclusion or economic boycotts. However, the exact nature of this so-called peaceful solution remains shrouded in secrecy. The world already sees it as a sealed gourd. Now, looking at today's statement from the US Secretary of State, "The US has ordered Dawes to attend the meeting. It would be beneficial to discuss Manchurian issues with representatives from various countries when necessary, as they relate to US interests or treaty obligations." What we hoped for from the US was for it to uphold justice as soon as possible. Now, the Secretary of State's first expression on this issue focuses on US interests and treaty obligations. We do not know what those interests or obligations are. The sealed gourd is even harder to break open. This is the second thing that makes our countrymen deeply suspicious.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although this extremely shocking theory of joint administration of China seems to have no basis, when viewed in light of the recent international words and actions, the subtle clues suggest that it may not be entirely without influence. Have our countrymen, who rely on the League of Nations and hope for the United States, awakened somewhat today? If the League of Nations truly has no such intention, it should quickly dispel our countrymen's doubts.</p>
<h3>How to Understand the Tanaka Memorial (3)</h3>
<p>After presenting several important concepts about why Japan is invading abroad and why the Tanaka Memorial's aggressive plan to invade our Northeast was produced, we should now return to the main topic of "How to Understand the Tanaka Memorial."</p>
<p>How should we understand the essence of the Tanaka Memorial's harm to our country? First, let's explore from an economic point of view.</p>
<p>The opening of the Memorial stated: "The so-called Manchuria and Mongolia are Fengtian, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Inner and Outer Mongolia. They cover 740,000 square miles with a population of 28 million, more than three times the size of our Japanese Empire... Not only is the land vast and the population sparse, which is enviable, but the abundance of agricultural, mineral, and forestry resources is unparalleled in the world." From this first point, we can determine that the Northeast is truly like a treasure trove, with goods and wealth overflowing the fields, easily accessible. We possess this treasure trove but fail to defend it properly. It is no wonder that international thieves are envious and plan to seize it. Their plan to seize it from an economic perspective is:</p>
<p>(1) Opposing free competition with "mercantilism." Advocating "rights-based policy towards China" to foster trade with vested interests, to curb the development of our country's industry and commerce, and to resist the eastward advance of Western European powers. Furthermore, using the vested interests of "Manchuria and Mongolia" as a command center to seize the sources of wealth of our entire country. Furthermore, using the resources of our country to conquer India, the South Seas islands, and Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>(2) Sending a large number of retired soldiers to Inner and Outer Mongolia to buy land, reclaim it into paddy fields, grow rice, and establish pastures to raise military horses and cattle for military and food use. If the majority of the land in that area is bought by them, then the territorial rights of Inner and Outer Mongolia will effectively be transferred to the Japanese.</p>
<p>(3) Actively transplanting Korean people into our Northeast. Japanese credit cooperatives or banks in various places, or the Oriental Development Company or the South Manchurian Railway Company, provide financial assistance to Korean people who have already acquired Chinese citizenship, using them to buy paddy fields in our Northeast as a command center for expanding their economic power.</p>
<p>(4) Implementing a railway policy. Opposing our country's construction of the Jihai Railway and the railway between Tongliao and Rehe. Grasping this transportation right to control the production of paddy fields, livestock, and wool in Inner Mongolia and striving to expand the output of wool to achieve self-sufficiency, as well as processing and manufacturing woolen goods to sell to Europe and the United States. Building the Taonan-Solun Railway to exploit the rich resources of the Tao'er River basin to cultivate the South Manchurian Railway, and using this road to invade Inner and Outer Mongolia to correspond to the Tongliao-Rehe line invading Southern Mongolia. Building the Chang-Tao Railway. After this road is completed, three branch lines will be extended from Dalaifu to Taonan, from Dalaifu to Anda, and from Dalaifu to Qiqihar, to threaten the Siberian Railway and seize the rich resources of Eastern Manchuria. The Chang-Tao line has vast land and sparse population, and the land is fertile. Even without fertilizer for 50 years, a good harvest can be achieved. Parts of this road will inevitably become a large area for industrial and agricultural product processing. If the Jihui Road is successful in the future, the resources of Mongolia and "Northern Manchuria" can be directly transported to Tokyo and Osaka. Building the Jihui Railway to transport the resources of "Manchuria and Mongolia" in a straight line. Grasping the forests of Jilin and processing them into utensils, works of art, or chemical paper. At least 20 million yuan can be earned each year. Seizing the Xinqiu coal mine, which contains 1.4 billion tons of coal with better quality than the Fushun coal. Extracting crude oil, agricultural fertilizers, and various chemicals for their own use and selling them to our country. Corresponding to the Fushun coal to conquer our entire country's industry. Seizing the gold mines and forests in the Mudanjiang River basin and the Jiapigou River basin in Jilin. Controlling the transportation costs of agricultural products, wine brewing, oil production, and soybean cakes in Dunhua, earning more than 200,000 yuan in net profit each year. Considering the combination of Kimura, Xinqiu coal, and by-products, the annual income of this road should be more than 8 million yuan. Furthermore, rights to forests, minerals, and commerce can be obtained, and the South Manchurian Railway can be cultivated to break through the rich resources of Northern Manchuria. Building the Hunchun-Hailin Railway to cultivate the strength of the Jihui Road. Preserving the prosperity of Posiette and Vladivostok from Huining in Korea. Using the water of Jingbo Lake to generate hydroelectric power to control the agricultural and industrial power of the entire Manchuria and Mongolia, and developing the paper industry of the Japanese Oji Paper Company. Its greatest effect is to break our country's plan to absorb the resources of Northern Manchuria through the Jilin-Wuchang Railway and export them through Huludao or Tianjin, and to make these resources still be exported from Chongjin Port in Korea.</p>
<p>"The railway is the fortress of the economy." Tanaka truly understood this meaning. Therefore, his railway plan in our Northeast, from an economic point of view alone, is enough to control our country's destiny. If this kind of railway plan is truly realized, then what prospects does our country's economy have in the vast future?</p>

<h3>Shi Zhaoji Continues to Report to the League of Nations on Japanese Atrocities</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Chief Chinese Representative Shi continued to submit to the Council that Japan instigated the Tianjin disturbances, stating that Tianjin Mayor Zhang Xueming had obtained more than ten confessions from captured rioters, confirming that the attempt to overthrow the local governments of Pingjin was instigated by the Japanese. Furthermore, artillery shells released from the Japanese concession were found in Tianjin, with the words "Made in Taisho 15" written on them. Moreover, 15 Lee-Enfield rifles and 20,000 rounds of ammunition, all made by the Shenyang Arsenal and seized by the Japanese two months ago, were found in a car from the Japanese concession entering the Chinese territory, along with several hand grenades with the words "Made in Taisho 15" written on them. He also stated that the latest reports received by the Chinese government indicated that the Japanese military authorities had not abandoned their ambition to penetrate deeper into Heilongjiang Province, still wanting to overthrow General Ma Zhanshan's Heilongjiang Provincial Government and replace it with a puppet government obedient to the Japanese, as they had done in Shenyang and Jilin. The situation at the Nenjiang Railway Bridge is extremely serious. In addition to Lieutenant Colonel Hayashi's demand that General Ma Zhanshan hand over power to the rebel General Zhang Haipei, the Japanese army is currently concentrating in Tailai Town, which is very close to the Nenjiang Bridge, with 4,000 Japanese infantrymen, two squadrons of cavalry, 240 military supply vehicles, and 13 vehicles of field hospital supplies stationed there. Furthermore, there are six aircraft, 40 field guns, two cannons, and two armored vehicles at the Nenjiang Bridge, preparing for war. (Eleventh National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Representative Shi cabled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 11th, stating that he had submitted the following report to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations Administrative Council, Drummond, on this day: (1) The Tianjin riots were all instigated by Japanese soldiers. The Japanese supplied military equipment to the reactionary army to urge them to attack Chinese government agencies. The captured people stated that they were instigated by the Japanese, and the military equipment they held was all Japanese goods. Japanese characters were also written on the artillery shells. Lee-Enfield rifles manufactured by the Shenyang Arsenal were found in a car, and Japanese characters were also written on the hand grenades. (2) Japan is determined to overthrow the Heilongjiang government. The situation is urgent. On the 8th, Honjo sent Hayashi to the Heilongjiang Provincial Government to demand concession. (3) There are many Japanese troops and military equipment in Tailai. They sent a detachment to seize the Chinese Fugaowan (transliteration) Mine and dispatched Japanese to manage it, expelling the original shareholders, which is undoubtedly an act of plunder. Finally, he requested the Chairman of the Administrative Council to notify the Japanese government to instruct Japanese soldiers to restore the original state and prevent the expansion of the incident.

<h3>Briand Asks China and Japan to Cease Military Action and Advocates Dispatching Observers</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Briand again telegraphed the Chinese and Japanese governments, asking both countries to strictly prohibit any further war in the three eastern provinces, and strongly emphasized the necessity of dispatching neutral observers to the Nenjiang Bridge to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. This telegram was sent by League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond on behalf of Briand. It first thanked the Chinese and Japanese governments for their replies to the telegram sent on the 6th, saying that after studying the replies and the latest reports, he deeply felt the need to firmly request the Chinese and Japanese governments to do their utmost to avoid increasing the seriousness of the situation, to issue the strictest orders to the commanding officers in the area to prohibit further military action, and then solemnly stated the importance of providing convenience to the international observers dispatched and strongly advocated that the League of Nations must dispatch neutral observers to the vicinity of the Nenjiang Bridge and Angangxi to collect reports related to the Council's resolution of September 30th. The telegram was signed by Briand. It was said here today that Drummond's representative to Japan, Walters, will arrive in Tokyo today and will act as an intermediary to facilitate negotiations between the League of Nations and the Japanese government.

<h3>Imperialist Powers Conspire to Divide China, Alarming Reports from Russian Newspapers</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov returned today from Turkey and Italy and resumed his diplomatic duties. During Litvinov's absence, Karakhan acted as his agent. Soviet newspapers are still vigorously criticizing Japan. Pravda reported that the imperialist powers tacitly acknowledge the establishment of a puppet government in Manchuria, which is being driven by Japan. This will be revealed to the world on November 16th. The League of Nations is unwilling to curb Japan's actions in the slightest. The major powers have agreed on a new pact to divide China. As for French newspapers expressing sympathy for Japanese policy, this is due to France's preparation to occupy Yunnan, it is said. (Eleventh National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Government and Public Attention to the Eastern Provinces Incident</h3>
<p>London Although the British government and the public are focusing on important domestic issues, the Manchurian situation is now gradually entering the forefront of British politics. Today, British cabinet members in political rallies across the country are using the Manchurian issue as the main event in their speeches, and the discussions in the House of Commons also focus on the Manchurian incident. Viscount Grey, who served as Foreign Secretary for many years, and Viscount Cecil, who has repeatedly served as the main British representative to the League of Nations, have also expressed important views on this dispute that endangers world peace. During the House of Commons debate on the King's Speech, Liberal Party member Mond vehemently stated the seriousness of the situation, denounced the policy of warmongering, and said that the Kellogg-Briand Pact must be maintained. If the League of Nations' moral strength is insufficient to make Japan change its attitude, then he hopes that the countries will adopt a boycott and economic pressure. When Mond said this, Conservative Party members said that this is war. Mond continued that if it is not, then it is directly admitting that the League of Nations is useless. He does not advocate force, but believes that economic and financial pressure can force Japan to understand that the world will not allow war again. Former Labour Transport Minister Morrison also spoke, expressing the Labour Party's concern that the League of Nations would lose its position due to the Manchurian issue, saying that this danger is real and the forces of darkness never sleep. The League of Nations has devoted its friendly efforts to stopping the Sino-Japanese war, but some powerful British newspapers have criticized the League of Nations' actions. He asked the British government not to take these criticisms seriously and hoped that the government would not undermine the courage of Geneva's efforts to end the war. Minister of Works Gore said in a speech in Clondon that the League of Nations' first responsibility for the Manchurian incident is to do its best to stop the bloodshed, and its second responsibility is to resolve the dispute without the use of force. He believes that the good friends of the League of Nations do not want to see its final sanctions implemented, nor do they want to see China or Japan withdraw from the League of Nations, but hope for the cooperation of both parties. Home Secretary Samuel gave a speech at the League of Nations Association in Manchester today, asking China and Japan to stop the war, saying that the people all want to persuade China and Japan to cease fire, withdraw their troops, discuss the points of contention and resolve them, and if necessary, submit to arbitration. As members of the League of Nations, they should accept the advice of the League of Nations and fulfill their obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact to abolish war. This is also the public opinion of the civilized world. The League of Nations Associations in Southampton and Liverpool also held meetings today. Viscount Grey spoke, saying that we cannot jump to conclusions before we know the truth. The question now is to determine to what extent the actions of the Japanese military authorities in Manchuria exceed what the situation truly requires. Viscount Cecil said in a speech in Liverpool that the upcoming Disarmament Conference is the largest international conference ever held. The Sino-Japanese difficulty is only part of the various difficulties that have occurred in the Far East in the past few years, and the resolution of this difficulty can be the most important factor in promoting world peace.

<h3>A Glimpse of British and German Public Opinion</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The diplomatic community received a telegram from Geneva, saying that the Manchester Guardian editorial said that the League of Nations Administrative Council's resolution of October 24th clearly meant that the Japanese army should withdraw. This resolution was unanimously passed except by Japan. At the same time, the League of Nations Covenant also stipulates that disputes between member states should be resolved by peaceful means. Now Japan is disregarding this covenant and carrying out military aggression. No matter how Japan skillfully defends itself, this action cannot but be regarded as an act of war. Japan accuses China of violating the treaty, but Japan has first violated the League of Nations Covenant and continues to violate it regardless of everything. Therefore, Japan's accusation that the League of Nations is unfair is tantamount to Japan violating world public opinion. If Japan does not quickly withdraw its troops in the Eastern Provinces, then those in the world who can sympathize with Japan are only a small group of people who approve of military aggression. (Twelfth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Chinese Embassy here issued a declaration today, stating that although China has always trusted the League of Nations and hopes that the League of Nations' mediation will resolve the Manchurian incident, if the guarantee of peace is once broken, China has the right to protect its territory and will never allow the Japanese to act recklessly in China again, such as the Japanese disturbing the security of Tianjin and destroying the transportation of Pingjin in recent days. German public opinion has paid close attention since the Manchurian incident occurred. Now that it sees the declaration of the Chinese Embassy, ​​it knows that the situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly urgent, and the panic among the general public is even greater, because the Sino-Japanese situation is already very ominous, and what is even more to be feared is that Soviet Russia clearly has a tendency to be involved in the vortex. Once the war breaks out, what attitude will Soviet Russia take? This is what the Germans urgently want to know. The newspapers have a deep discussion about this, and most of them mean that if Soviet Russia cannot avoid being involved in the war, then the disaster of the whole world will come soon, and Germany's situation is particularly worrying, because Germany and Russia border each other, and the impact is most easily felt. However, according to the observation of most German newspapers, the current Soviet Russia must strive to avoid war, because the current Soviet Russia is really unprepared for war, even the transportation is not yet ready, and the disorder of the China Eastern Railway is an undeniable fact. The Berliner Tageblatt once said that it had special news about the future actions of Soviet Russia, saying that Soviet Russia is determined not to favor any party and offend the other party, and according to the current situation, Soviet Russia would rather give up the China Eastern Railway and never rashly take up arms due to Japanese provocation, because the leaders of Soviet Russia believe that the competition of others is irrelevant to them, and even temporary honor and disgrace can be ignored, but they are willing to sit and wait, expecting that all oppressed nations in the world will come to them one by one in the future. In addition, the German government's organ newspaper Germania supports direct negotiations between China and Japan, saying that military and propaganda are not enough to resolve the Manchurian incident. Since the Chinese and Japanese nations belong to the same race and culture, they should quickly abandon their old grievances and repair their relations to avoid the world being threatened together.

<h3>Memorial for the Opening of the Fourth National Congress and the Premier's Birthday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the event was held at the Central University Auditorium, with Yu Youren as the interim chairman and Chiang delivering a speech on the mission of the congress.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fourth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang opened at the Central University Auditorium on the morning of December 12th. Over a thousand central executive and supervisory committee members, party representatives from various provinces and cities, and representatives from various institutions in the capital attended. First, a memorial service was held for the Premier's birthday, with Yu Youren as the interim chairman, and the ceremony was conducted as customary. Lin Sen reported on the significance of commemorating the Premier's birthday. Then, the opening ceremony of the congress was held, also with Yu Youren as the interim chairman, who delivered the opening address. Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech on the mission of the Fourth National Congress. Music was played, photographs were taken, and the ceremony concluded. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek said in his speech at the opening of the Fourth National Congress, "Chairman, fellow comrades, today is the Premier's birthday, and the Fourth National Congress of our party is opening today. At this time of internal and external troubles, when we recall the Premier's instructions and examine the revolutionary environment, we truly feel endless thoughts. Our Chinese Kuomintang, since its reorganization in the 13th year of the Republic of China, has held four national congresses in these eight years. During the First National Congress, the Premier himself was present to guide us, entrusting our party with the responsibility of leading the nation in transforming the country. Opening ceremony photography of the Fourth National Congress (Nanjing Guanghua).</p>
<p>I remember that the Premier said at the time that after the First National Congress, the party would be handed over to all of our party members. The Premier himself felt old at the time, and could not foresee when he would leave us due to his struggle and sacrifice for the revolution, so he had to hope that his comrades would take joint responsibility. Before the First National Congress, the responsibility for our Chinese revolutionary cause, to be honest, was borne by the Premier alone. At that time, the Premier saw that some party members did not understand the responsibility of the revolution, relying solely on the leader. He felt that this revolutionary situation was very dangerous, so the Premier was very sad that he had devoted his life to the revolution, was already old, and the future of the revolution had not yet been bright. Therefore, he had these painful words, entrusting the revolutionary cause to all party comrades in a spirit of entrusting his orphans, so that everyone would know that the revolution was the common responsibility of all party comrades. When we think back to this sentence today, we truly feel very heartbroken and extremely ashamed. In these eight years, how much effort have we put into the party entrusted to us by the Premier? How much effort have we put into the country and the revolution? The more we think about it, the more we feel ashamed to the Premier. At the opening of the First National Congress, the Premier personally guided us, asking all party comrades to take on the two major responsibilities of reorganizing our party and transforming China. In addition, he also pointed out a key point to us, which is to have a solid spirit of unity, so that the revolution will not fail. The Premier said that the reason why our party could not be consolidated in the past was not because any enemy used great strength to break us, but entirely because we destroyed ourselves. The unity of the whole party was very lax, and the revolution often failed because of this. Thinking of this, all of our loyal party members should feel ten thousand times ashamed in their hearts. The Premier also said at the time that the most important thing for our revolutionary party is to be united by a single spirit. The so-called spiritual unity is to make us understand that we must take on the responsibility of revolution for the party and the country. The first is to sacrifice freedom, and the second is to contribute ability. If we individuals can sacrifice our freedom for the party, then the whole party can gain freedom. If individuals can contribute all their abilities to the party, then the party will have ability. The Premier pointed out that the reason why our revolutionary party had not succeeded by the 13th year of the Republic of China was because we only cared about individual freedom and individual strength, causing the party to lose freedom and strength, leading to failure. This is indeed an extremely precise lesson. Now we must reflect on whether we can do what the Premier said. Since the Premier led us to reorganize our party at the First National Congress, until after the Second National Congress, in the years in between, countless comrades, countless generals, and countless people sacrificed their lives and property in order to unify Guangdong and complete the Northern Expedition. By the time of the Third National Congress, our party had already unified the country. The National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and the Congress was held in the capital. We generally felt that we were worthy of the responsibilities and missions entrusted to us by the Premier. However, in order to prevent the revolution from failing and suffering setbacks, no matter what, we must protect the Chinese Kuomintang, which was created and left behind by the Premier's painstaking efforts. Not only must we protect it, but we must also promote it and make it more consolidated and more substantial, so that we will not fail the Premier's dying wishes. Now let us think about it, since the Third National Congress, until today, the Fourth National Congress has also opened. What kind of situation have we become? Thinking of this, it truly fills us with endless grief. When the Premier was alive, we had the Premier to lead us, and the general party members only needed to follow the Premier. After the Premier's death, we hoped that senior comrades with history and experience would follow the Premier's teachings, unite in sincerity, and strive to complete the mission of the revolution. Only in this way would the party have a foundation and the revolution have a way out. However, in the current situation, not only is what the Premier expected of us not being achieved, but in fact, since the Third National Congress, our party has been fragmented, almost cutting off the vitality of the National Revolution, and even the already unified situation cannot be preserved. How can we be worthy of the Premier? How can we be worthy of the martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution? How can we be worthy of the general public who sacrificed for the revolution and are eager for our party to save them? Especially at this time when the country is in crisis, the tyrannical Japanese are oppressing us at all times. The land sovereignty and administration of the three northeastern provinces are almost completely under the heavy trampling of Japan. Recently, there was another riot in Tianjin. The instigation behind it is very obvious. This makes the people of the whole country live in sorrow and anxiety every day. The general public blames our party and blames the government. When we reflect on ourselves, what should we feel? Is this the situation that the Premier expected of us? Did our martyred comrades, who sacrificed for the revolution, for the country, and for the nation, expect this kind of situation from us? When we examine ourselves, we truly feel that we cannot face the Premier, we cannot face the martyrs, and we cannot face the people of the whole country. Now we must catch up quickly, and we should know how to correct our shortcomings, restore the life of our party, appease the long-cherished wishes of the people, and lead the people to complete the mission of the National Revolution. The National Congress is the highest authority of the party. The representatives of the Fourth National Congress must take on the responsibility of leading the National Revolution in difficult and arduous times. This is the most important mission of the Congress. Since we have taken on this mission, we must painstakingly study and find a bright and proper path. We must study how to gain the faith of the people of the whole country, so that the general public can believe in the Premier's teachings and practice the Premier's Three Principles of the People. We must first examine our past shortcomings and seek the key to failure. The facts are clear. The past events are still nothing more than what the Premier said, that if we cannot have a spirit of unity, then the revolution will definitely fail. The Premier's earnest admonition to our comrades is the only guide for us to establish ourselves, save the party, and save the country. Our Chinese revolution cannot fail, as long as we can unite, no matter how serious the enemy's external troubles are, they cannot resist our revolutionary spirit. Therefore, the most important thing is to open up a path so that this Congress can truly unite. Only then can we use the power of unity to eliminate all external troubles. "Brothers quarreling internally, resisting insults from outside," this idiom of thousands of years is the most accurate and unchanging lesson, and it has particularly profound significance today. Now we want to resist foreign insults and protect the country, so we ask ourselves whether we have the spirit of "brothers quarreling internally, resisting insults from outside." Being in the current situation of enemy foreign troubles pressing and surrounding us, we are opening the Fourth National Congress to break through the difficult encirclement and open up a way of life for the future. Apart from truly restoring our spirit of unity and creating the unified strength of the whole party, there is no other way. In order to achieve unity, our comrades should sacrifice everything and endure everything. Everyone should take the Premier's heart as their heart, and take the interests of the country and the interests of the revolution as the premise. I believe that there is nothing that cannot be achieved in unity. However, for our party, which bears the responsibility of revolution and saving the country, to truly talk about unity, there is another indispensable element, which is respecting discipline. If a revolutionary group abandons discipline, empty unity is not only useless, but the result is still failure. Therefore, we must seek unity within discipline in order to unite our party, otherwise we are not uniting our party, but ruining our party. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>

If they must express their intention of hosting, regardless of public or private, they should transfer the banquet to the use of resisting the enemy or relieving disasters. The interim chairman Yu Youren requested the Congress to pay attention to this, declining unnecessary social engagements, and shifting their valuable time and energy to the proceedings of the Congress. The representatives at the scene unanimously agreed. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<h3>Hoover's Moving Speech on Armistice Day</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, November 11 President Hoover's speech on Armistice Day began with the line that peace is the product of preparedness for national defense. He continued by saying that peace cannot be secured merely by resolutions and orders, but relies on the patient resolution of disputes, the vigorous development of forces of goodwill, and the ideas of many nations being troubled by past injustices. Some fear foreign invasion and being controlled by it, while others hold hope for freedom and independence. As for the people of today, everywhere one can gain public attention, and even seek survival, by arousing forces that fuel hatred and fear of their neighbors, resulting in the world's armaments exceeding those before the Great War. President Hoover also addressed the restoration of trust, calling it an issue that statesmen of all countries must pay attention to. He said that this matter requires no treaty revisions, no documents, and no constraints, but only the awareness of the overall situation by each country and mutual assistance in creating goodwill. President Hoover concluded by mentioning the progress made in recent consultations among national leaders, saying that this kind of cooperation, as well as cooperation in finance, industry, and social organization, will surely open up new avenues for relieving the suffering world.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>The Black Army Caught in a Fierce Battle</h3>
<p>▲ Fierce battle for two days and nights since the 5th ▲ Japanese army reinforces with large troops for a fierce attack</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Japanese army, without any reason, initiated hostilities, attacking the defending troops of the Jiangqiao Station on my Tao'an Road Line. Afterwards, they publicly claimed that our army was obstructing their bridge construction work, and used planned military action to attack the Japanese army. This is truly trying to deceive the world with a single hand. On the night the incident occurred, Ma Zhanshan sent a special telegram to Zhong Yu, the special envoy for foreign affairs in Harbin, stating the cause of the war and instructing him to forward it to the foreign consuls stationed in Harbin. The original text is as follows: "Zhong Yu, my brother, I trust you are well. The Japanese army's aid to Zhang Haipeng forcing Jiang is a blatant action. The fact cannot be concealed. Today, the main force of the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on us. Seven Japanese aircraft flew back and forth over our defense zone, dropping bombs. Eighteen mountain guns fired fiercely, and our army was under great pressure. The Japanese army disregards justice and everything else. We are engaging in legitimate self-defense and should resist with all our might. The battle is still ongoing. I hope you will convey the above situation to the consuls of various countries. Ma Zhanshan, with seal." After the outbreak of this war, in order to substantiate their excuse, the Japanese army fabricated claims that there were Soviet officers commanding the Black Army and that during the intense fighting on the 5th, more than a hundred shots were fired with perfect accuracy, etc. Ma Zhanshan issued a public telegram to refute the rumors, saying: "Recently, there have been rumors outside that Jiang Province has hired foreigners as instructors and that other countries are providing military supplies, which are purely fabricated and are obviously groundless rumors with ulterior motives. I hereby solemnly declare this to clarify the truth. Ma Zhanshan, Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang Province." As for the recent front-line battles, according to what we have heard here, after the war resumed at noon on the 5th, the Japanese army transported eighteen field guns and fired fiercely at our army from across the riverbank. Aircraft dropped bombs in the air. The Black Army was attacked from above and below. Although the soldiers were under extreme pressure, they still resisted to the death. Two hours later, Zhang Haipeng personally supervised the rebel troops of Li Zizhen and Song Liansheng's regiment, and Zhang Junqing and Zhang Junzhe's two cavalry detachments, advancing from Tailai to Zhendong, and attacked the Black Army in two routes to support the Japanese army. Zhang Junqing's troops built rafts and tried to cross the river secretly from the Hetao area, but were discovered by the Black Army cavalry detachment, which immediately intercepted them in that area. The Japanese army and Zhang's rebel troops joined forces to attack us. However, at that time, we only had Wu's regiment of cavalry, with fewer than a thousand men. Surrounded by the enemy's ground and air forces, they gradually reached a critical situation. Two and a half hours later, Wu's cavalry's second regiment and the advance team of the newly formed Tuntian Army (temporarily organized as the 1st Brigade of the Black Army Infantry), Wang's regiment, arrived, dismounted at Daxingzhen, and rushed to the front line, joining the battle. They fiercely fired and repelled the enemy. More than four or five hundred Japanese soldiers died, their bodies lying in the fields, and they fled back to Taonan in a panic. At 3:30 PM on the same day, the battle ceased. Our army checked the casualties. Zhang, a lieutenant colonel and company commander of the 1st Cavalry Regiment, was killed in action, and three deputy company commanders also died. More than a hundred soldiers were killed, and more than fifty were wounded. The 1st Regiment fought fiercely for a day, and the soldiers were exhausted. Only then could they rest a little. One side also deployed defensive fortifications on the north bank of the river. The Japanese army, retreating to Taonan, actively mobilized the Hasedera Brigade from Changchun, the Amano Brigade from Jilin, and the garrison from Gongzhuling, totaling as many as four thousand men, three times stronger than before. Zhang Haipeng also used all the rebels as a vanguard, attacking us in three prongs on the night of the 5th. Zhang Haipeng's army crossed the river west of Jiangqiao to seize Daguantun, attacking our flank. The Japanese Hasedera Brigade built rafts east of Jiangqiao to seize Xinlitun, detouring around to attack the rear of our army. Another prong attacked from the front of Jiangqiao. They made contact around 3:00 AM. The Japanese army used searchlights to find the direction of our army and fired tracer bullets to aim at our army. Our army lay in ambush in the reeds along the river and resisted with all our might. The Japanese fired hundreds of shells, and half of our trenches were destroyed by the artillery. The soldiers could not hide, so they lay in the water and grass and fought back. Zhang's rebel troops, who secretly crossed the river from Daguantun, had two rafts overturned by Yuan's brigade (Tuntian Army), and countless rebels fell into the water and died drifting. Therefore, they were defeated. However, at dawn, more than ten Japanese aircraft came to assist in the attack, dropping bombs weighing more than a hundred pounds. Our army was concerned about the airspace, and the cavalry lost contact due to the chaos, so they were taken advantage of by the Japanese army, which built pontoon bridges under the cover of artillery fire. Infantry and cavalry rushed across the bridge with handheld machine guns as the vanguard. At the same time, the Japanese army that detoured from Xinlitun also arrived. Our army's position wavered, and we had no choice but to retreat thirty-five li, stopping near Daxing Station. Around 11:00 AM, Wu's cavalry went to the left and right wings, and the artillery infantry was the mainstay, covering the counterattack. Brigade Commander Wu Songshan personally led the way at the front, and the soldiers' shouts shook the field. They charged in a large encirclement. The enemy army was disheartened. Zhang Haipeng's Mongol bandits were the first to collapse and flee, affecting all the other units, who could not stand their ground. Our army then encircled them one by one and launched a fierce attack, disarming and eliminating Zhang Junqing's detachment in the Hetao area. Zhang led dozens of trusted followers and broke through, escaping by floating on the water. Many Japanese soldiers were also killed by our army, but they still resisted stubbornly, waiting for reinforcements. More than ten of their aircraft came to drop bombs and break the encirclement. Our army is determined to eliminate the enemy, so the fierce battle is still ongoing. Today, around 11:00 AM, the sound of artillery fire from the front was loud, and it could be faintly heard even in Ang'angxi. As a result, each train fleeing from the Harbin-Manchuria Line to Harbin was full. Four Japanese aircraft also arrived in Ang'angxi at 11:45 AM on the 6th to scout, dropping four bombs. Although they fell in the wilderness and did not injure anyone, people became even more agitated. At 1:00 to 2:30 PM, a Japanese aircraft circled over the station for reconnaissance, and left around 1:00 PM. Japanese and Korean residents in Heihe, fearing being killed because our army firmly refuses to surrender, have all taken refuge in the Japanese consulate. Japanese Consul Shimizu, because Ma Zhanshan's attitude is stern, has also disappeared and dare not raise protests anymore, and plans to lead the expatriates out of Heihe tomorrow. (6th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Deploys Troops on the Border</h3>
<p>▲ Adopting a "ready for action" posture against Japan</p>
<p>▲ Their actions will soon become clear</p>
<p>Continental News reports that an American aviator, Mr. So-and-so, recently arrived in Shanghai from Kulun. According to him, the Soviet Union is showing increasing signs of unease regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute. This can be seen from the large number of troops stationed at key points in Outer Mongolia. The Soviet Union has stationed seven squadrons of the latest aircraft near key locations on the Trans-Manchurian Railway. There are signs of large-scale military preparations throughout Outer Mongolia, especially in Manzhouli. The troops near Manzhouli are primarily cavalry, mostly Mongolian soldiers. Twelve armored trains are stationed in Irkutsk, operated by Soviet infantry, equipped with winter warfare supplies. Nearby warehouses are filled with military rations. Russians in Mongolia harbor anti-Japanese sentiments. The Soviet Union is unwilling to stand by and watch Japan occupy Manchuria. The actions of the troops will be determined by the results of the League of Nations meeting on November 16.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News, dated the 1st, carries a Harbin dispatch stating that Russian-language newspapers published here by the Japanese without the approval of the Chinese authorities are filled with news of various Soviet activities, causing considerable anxiety among residents. Although such news has been repeatedly denied by the Russian government, most people believe that the Japanese are deliberately creating and spreading it. However, there are also some facts at this time that are sufficient to make one speculate that the Soviet Union has not failed to prepare for emergencies and will take action if necessary. For example, the sudden recall of some important personnel of the Chinese Eastern Railway to Moscow cannot be regarded as an ordinary event. Furthermore, the transfer of a large number of freight cars to Hailar in the far west and Hengdaohezi in the far east, preparing to go to the border, proves that the railway has received orders to prepare to transport troops at any time. Because there is no grain to be transported in the Hailar area, the empty cars are stationed there, and their only purpose is, of course, to be sent to the border when necessary. Furthermore, although the Russian government absolutely denies the mobilization of its troops on the border, there is clear evidence that Blagoveshchensk has issued orders for men in the Far East of Siberia to report to nearby military camps. Last week, a certain Westerner arrived in Harbin from Blagoveshchensk and personally saw notices posted at various stations in Ussuriysk, ordering local men to join the army. In practice, this move is tantamount to mobilization. Furthermore, speeches were given in Blagoveshchensk, advising people to prepare, and if Japan interferes with the Chinese Eastern Railway and Soviet property, they should rise up together to maintain their rights in the three northeastern provinces. In addition, two armored trains were witnessed preparing to go to the border of the Eastern Provinces. At this time, the Russian army is not used to antagonize China, but only to protect its own property. If its purpose is to resist the Japanese, China will not obstruct its actions. Japan is well aware of the Soviet Union's military preparations on the border, and this is why it has been hesitant to occupy the entire territory of Manchuria. But if Japan does do this, it will inevitably do so within the next two weeks, before the League of Nations Administrative Council reconvenes on November 16. The volume of soybean transactions last week was very large, reaching more than a thousand cars yesterday alone. Such a huge volume of transactions in a single day is unprecedented in the past year, which proves that exporters are all afraid that war will break out and grain transportation will be suspended, so they want to ship goods out of the country before the outbreak of war. It is the general opinion that in the next two weeks, major incidents may occur in northern Manchuria, but no one can predict their nature. The Soviet Union will not allow others to interfere with the Chinese Eastern Railway. If Japan is determined to force Qiqihar and Harbin to join the so-called Manchurian autonomous government, then it is not known by what means a clash between the two sides can be avoided. The Russian-language newspapers run by the Japanese are now engaged in provocative propaganda against Russia, clearly wanting to anger the Russians. The winter weather in northern Manchuria is extremely cold, and the Russians are accustomed to it. If war breaks out, the Russians are actually at an advantage over the Japanese.</p>
<h3>More Detailed Account of the Tianjin Incident</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The reporter has not slept for two nights, but still has to rouse himself to engage in reporting. The communication yesterday was hastily drafted. Unexpectedly, due to the interruption of traffic, it could not be mailed and had to be posted today. I have drafted this article with the news I have received, to supplement what was not detailed in yesterday's letter. (Editor's Note: The content of the communication on the 9th is roughly the same as the Beijing communication in yesterday's newspaper. To save space, it is omitted.)</p>
<p>▲ Supplementary Account of the Launch of the Incident. The general office of the plainclothes team is located at No. 5 and No. 7 Penglai Street in the Japanese concession. According to most people, the key figures are Li Jichun and Zhang Bi. However, according to a certain civil servant, the reason is complex and details will be announced soon. It is said that the total number of rioters is about 3,500 people, who had early contact with the Japanese Garrison Headquarters, so they can act openly and without fear. According to a certain youth who has already awakened and abandoned the life of the plainclothes team (he requested that his name not be announced to avoid danger), he told the reporter that a total of four people joined at the same time as him. The organization of the team is divided into divisions, brigades, regiments, battalions, and companies. He has not met the division, brigade, and regimental commanders and cannot know who they are. He only goes to Taipingli every day to receive food and listen to news. The treatment in the team is not uniform, roughly divided into three grades. Those who have received military training are Grade A, receiving a living allowance of one yuan per day and a box cannon with twelve rows of bullets. Ordinary hooligans and local thugs are Grade B, receiving eight jiao per day and a rifle with eight rows of bullets. Ordinary unemployed workers are Grade C, receiving four jiao per day and a rifle with four rows of bullets. On the day of the launch, each person was given five yuan. Li Jichun, Zhang Bi, etc., must summon middle and lower-level leaders every day to give speeches, either in the Datong Apartment or in the Wanguo Apartment. It is estimated that more than a thousand people received firearms in advance and mixed into the Chinese territory. Unexpectedly, the news leaked, the Chinese territory was under special martial law, traffic was cut off, and the police notified door to door that no one was allowed to go out at night, otherwise they would be killed without mercy. Therefore, the plainclothes team lurking in the Chinese territory could not gather. He attacked the No. 2 District and No. 6 Police Station from Haiguang Temple in the Japanese concession. Having not received training usually, he was frightened at the sound of gunfire. Seeing that three of his companions had been killed or wounded, he retreated, intending to escape, but was caught by the squad leader. After begging, he was spared death, leaving his armband and ammunition and was released to escape. He also said that the password on that day was "National Salvation Success." According to a certain driver of the Beiyang Motor Company, someone hired a car to Taipingli on the evening of the 8th to send the plainclothes team to the gate, ordering them to attack the No. 2 Telephone Bureau. Ten people went first. When they reached the door of the Telephone Bureau, they could not break in because the door was closed, so they returned. The second time, four Japanese soldiers directed the advance. When they reached the front of the Telephone Bureau, they fired their guns to show their power. The security team ambushing nearby also fired back. Two plainclothes team members were killed and three were wounded. One Japanese soldier was also killed. They snatched the corpses back to the Japanese concession. Thus, they advanced and retreated, causing disturbances all night, until the Japanese soldiers used artillery to bombard them, assisting the plainclothes team in attacking, at 6:00 AM on the 9th. This was the most intense scene of the riot.</p>
<p>▲ The Security Team's Valiant Resistance. At the beginning of the riot, the Security Team knew that the Japanese army was instigating it and became even more determined to resist the enemy. Therefore, even in the cold night, everyone bared their arms and fought back. At 12:00 AM on the 8th, nine cars drove out of the Japanese concession, carrying more than forty plainclothes team members, and rushed straight to Dongma Road, intending to occupy the Provincial Government. The security team ambushed on both sides of the sidewalk and chased after the cars. The plainclothes team fought back in the cars. When they reached Dongmenlian, they saw that the security team was getting more and more numerous and knew they could not win, so they turned their cars around and drove towards Xu Street in the Japanese concession. Japanese soldiers quickly blocked the electric fence and turned on the current. The cars could not enter the concession. They fought fiercely at the southeast corner of the city for an hour. As a result, more than ten plainclothes team members were killed or wounded, and more than twenty were captured because they ran out of ammunition. Six members of the security team were also injured. More than twenty plainclothes team members died in the Fugui Village building block and on Dajie Street in Nanma Road. More than ten of them were rickshaw pullers. At 6:30 AM on the 9th, the plainclothes team, under the cover of Japanese artillery fire, attacked the Public Security Bureau. The security team placed another ambush in a dark corner, feigning defeat in the front. When the plainclothes team advanced to the entrance of the Public Security Bureau, the ambush behind rose up together. The plainclothes team was attacked from the front and back. Seventeen people were killed and eighty were captured alive. Nine members of the security team were injured and sent to the Municipal Hospital. One of them died from his injuries. Sang Zhenshan, the fifth company commander, was also seriously injured. It is said that as of noon on the 10th, the security team had successively captured more than two hundred plainclothes team members. After the Public Security Bureau interrogated them and obtained their confessions, eighty were sent to Beiping. There were also those who were executed on the spot after interrogation, including five at Dong Fubiao, five at the southeast corner of the city, and four inside Dongmen.</p>
<p>▲ The City Government's Protest. At 10:30 AM on the morning of the 9th, Mayor Zhang Xueming invited the commanders of the British, American, French, and Italian troops stationed in Tianjin to his residence in the special zone to discuss the situation. He stated that he was determined to do his best to maintain law and order. If they were purely rioters, he could be responsible for quickly suppressing them. Now the rioters are relying on the protection of the Japanese concession and the Japanese army, which makes the security team hesitant to act, so he asked the commanders of the various countries to pay attention to the safety of the expatriates of the various countries, and asked the authorities of the Japanese concession not to protect the rioters and to expel the bad elements in the concession. The commanders of the various countries visited Japanese Commander Kashi at 1:00 PM. The results are not yet known. The official protest letter from the Municipal Government to the Japanese consulate was sent out at 4:00 PM that day (9th). The content first described the course of the incident, and then discussed the issue of responsibility, roughly stating: "At 10:30 PM on the 8th of this month, more than a thousand plainclothes team members attacked the police stations in the Chinese territory from the Japanese concession. Plainclothes team members were also found at the same time in all areas bordering the Japanese concession. At 5:00 AM on the 9th, the plainclothes team retreated slightly. The Japanese army suddenly parked two armored vehicles at the gate and demonstrated to our police. At 6:30 AM, artillery shells were fired from the Japanese concession towards the Public Security Bureau and the Telephone Bureau, and the shells landed in front of the Public Security Bureau. According to the captured plainclothes team members, the Japanese sent them to Huajie to start their activities, etc. This mayor has long heard that the organization of this plainclothes team is in the Japanese concession. He has repeatedly sent people to discuss with your consulate to find ways to arrest and extradite them. Unfortunately, there has been no effect until now. Last night, a riot broke out. It is regrettable that this kind of behavior that disrupts the law and order of Tianjin is caused by the laissez-faire attitude of your authorities. In the future, or because of this, the lives and property of foreign expatriates of various countries will be damaged, as well as the losses suffered by our country because of this incident, your concession authorities should bear considerable responsibility. I hereby lodge a protest, and I hope that your consul will strictly prohibit the conspiracy of the rioters in the Japanese concession and extradite them. Furthermore, this morning at 6:00 AM, a telegram was received from the chairman of Hebei Province, stating that the Japanese commander requested that the police originally stationed in the Chinese territory retreat 300 meters, etc. The Chinese police were originally established to maintain local law and order, so they should perform their duties in the Chinese territory. No matter what party, they have no right to request to withdraw backwards. However, in order to safeguard amity and avoid misunderstandings, this mayor has ordered them to withdraw 300 meters. However, your country must not advance because of this. It is best to withdraw a corresponding number of meters, so as to show fairness. It is hoped that the above items will be examined by your consul general and replied to. It is said that the Japanese Acting Consul General Tajiri is considering a reply after reading the note.</p>
<p>▲ The Terror in the City Has Not Ended. Since 10:00 PM on the 8th, the entire city has been in terror. Last night (9th), the lights in the entire Chinese city and the Japanese concession were turned off, with only the lights inside the various agencies shining. The lights outside were also turned off. The Dagongbao and Minbao newspapers were unable to be published yesterday due to the interruption of traffic. They were already printed, but could not be distributed. Last night, the lights were turned off and the machines could not operate, so they were suspended. After nightfall yesterday, both the Chinese territory and the Japanese concession became a dark world. The Japanese set up field guns and searchlights on the sixth floor of the Zhongyuan Company building and set up observation posts with military telephones on the highest level of the tower on the sixth floor. The riverbanks were filled with Japanese soldiers, who fired at the Special No. 2 District to the south from time to time. Therefore, the riverbank area felt dangerous and was completely evacuated yesterday. At 7:30 PM, Japanese Consul So-and-so visited Mayor Zhang again, asking for permission to escort the Japanese expatriates in the Special No. 1, 2, and 3 Districts out of the country. Zhang immediately agreed to his request. Last night, the reservists of the Japanese concession were all dispatched, and the patrolling police were completely withdrawn. The plainclothes Chinese detectives also disappeared. The situation was serious, like a battlefield. Today (10th), Japanese concession and Chinese merchants are still closed, and there are no pedestrians on the streets. The Japanese families who are barely making a living have already run out of food, and the middle-class families are also running out of food. The more than 300 employees of the No. 2 Telephone Bureau have run out of food for two days. This morning, they notified the Japanese soldiers to stop shooting and used cars to transport a large amount of food to them. However, it is impossible to help the ordinary merchants who have run out of food, which is also tragic. The large stores in the French concession are still closed, and the small grocery stores have opened for business. However, due to the interruption of supplies, everything is expensive. Fortunately, the security was tight last night, and the plainclothes team's general attack was not carried out. However, there was constant gunfire all night, and this morning we heard the sound of cannons rumbling. It was found that it was Japanese warships firing blank rounds to show their power.

<h3>Deputy Zhang's Representative Fan Pujiang Arrives in Jinan to Meet Han</h3>
<p>Negotiating the Issue of Security in North China</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Zhang Xueliang's representative, Fan Pujiang, arrived in Jinan from Beiping this morning (10th) at 12:20 PM. According to Fan, his mission is that the deputy commander went to Beijing to consult with Commander-in-Chief Chiang on the Northeast's diplomatic issues. Because it is related to the security of North China, he must report to Chairman Han, as well as report on the current situation in the Northeast, the Japanese army's aid to Zhang Haipeng in disturbing Heilongjiang, and the recent employment of hooligans by the Japanese army to disturb Tianjin. He will return north in about three to five days. The city of Tianjin has now been calmed down and there is nothing wrong. At the beginning of the incident, the Japanese hired hooligans and thugs at a price of 40 yuan, provided them with firearms, and set off from the Japanese concession on the evening of the 8th, firing guns to cause disturbances. Our military and police had already received this information in advance and were heavily guarded. After they fired their guns, they immediately returned fire to resist. The hooligans' gunfire was inaccurate, and our military and police were not killed or injured. They were immediately repelled. However, the people inevitably suffered stray bullets. The deputy commander, to prevent the Japanese army from formally joining in, transferred a regiment of troops from Junliangcheng to Tianjin to prepare for resistance. Later, the Japanese army did not join in, but fired more than ten cannons. Our negotiators went to question them, but they did not admit it, saying that the cannons were fired by Chinese and asked our police to keep a distance of 300 meters from their army to prevent conflicts. Although the incident has been calmed down, because of the fear that the rioters will try to riot again, martial law is still in effect. Zhang Haipeng's army in Heilongjiang would have been wiped out by our army long ago if it had not been for the Japanese army's aid from the middle. The Japanese army are all wearing Chinese military uniforms, mixed with Zhang Haipeng's army to command, and also sent six aircraft to drop bombs everywhere in an attempt to cause disturbances. Our army, led by Ma Zhanshan, is resisting to the death. The Japanese army has been repeatedly punished. Chairman Wan (Fulin) originally wanted to come to Jinan to meet Chairman Han, but he could not spare the time because of the Heilongjiang incident, so the deputy commander sent his brother as a representative. Fan then went to the Jiaoji Hotel to rest, and went to the Provincial Government at 4:00 PM to meet Han and had dinner at the Provincial Government. (10th)</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Transfers Administrative Expenses to Subsidize Military Expenses</h3>
<p>▲ Approximately 200,000 Yuan Per Month</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Han Fuju's troops total five divisions and two brigades, with a monthly salary of 1.07 million yuan, which was previously issued by the central government every month. In recent months, the central government's finances have been difficult and unable to be issued, but they can still barely maintain it. Officials' salaries are reduced. As of now in September, only more than 100,000 yuan has been issued. The minimum expenses of the various units have also been impossible to meet. However, at this time of local decay, it is not possible to increase the burden on the people. Today (10th), all members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Government and Zhang Shaotang, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, and Wu Zhenzan, President of the High Court, temporarily proposed to use administrative expenses to subsidize military expenses and drafted two measures, which were immediately approved. They will be deducted from November. Once military expenses are available, they will be stopped and returned as appropriate. The measures are: (1) 150,000 yuan will be raised monthly from the Provincial Government and its affiliated agencies' temporary expenses, education reserve funds, construction department, and construction expenses of the Public Works Bureau. (2) Civil servants of the Provincial Government and its affiliated agencies with a monthly salary of 60 yuan or more will deduct 2 yuan per month. From 60 yuan to 200 yuan, 2 yuan will be deducted for every 20 yuan increase. From 220 yuan to 560 yuan, 3 yuan will be deducted for every 20 yuan increase. According to statistics, the two items will generate approximately 200,000 yuan per month, which can be used to supplement. The original text of the proposal of the Provincial Government is recorded as follows: 1. It is found that the military salary is extremely important. The military expenses of the troops stationed in this province have always been allocated and issued by the central government on a regular basis. Recently, there have been many events and financial difficulties. The central government has accumulated a large number of expenses owed to the stationed troops. Letters and telegrams of appeal have been ineffective. The minimum expenses of the various units have reached the point where they cannot be maintained. The committee members and others have been discussing with each other to maintain the military salary, and have tentatively drafted two measures for the provincial government to subsidize the military salary among the impossible measures: (1) 150,000 yuan will be raised monthly from the temporary expenses of the Provincial Government and its affiliated agencies, education reserve funds, construction department, and construction expenses of the Public Works Bureau. After the end of the year, the number of expenses will be allocated to the various agencies. (2) Every month, from the salary items of the Provincial Government and its affiliated agencies, except for those below 60 yuan, deductions will be made according to the progressive method from 60 yuan. The number to be deducted each month should be instructed to the various agencies to truthfully report the number of salaries for accounting purposes. The above measures are in the same opinion. In addition to converting the deduction of salaries into standard numbers and listing them separately, is the proposal feasible? It should be submitted to the general meeting for public decision, and the affiliated agencies should be notified to comply and tide over the difficulties together. It is for the public good."

<h3>Military and Civilian Conflict in Changle County, Fujian</h3>
<p>▲ Caused by the Irrigation Bureau Forcibly Collecting Water Fees</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The Lianbinggang Irrigation Bureau of Changle County was established by naval personnel who pooled their funds. Figures such as Yang Shuzhuang, Ma Deji, and Chen Zhaoqiang serve as directors of the bureau. The bureau uses machinery to pump water from the Min River over the mountains to irrigate the arid fields of Changle. It charges water fees per acre. However, due to poor management, the bureau suffered significant losses. To compensate for these losses, it repeatedly increased water fees, leading to numerous complaints from farmers and frequent disputes. Starting this year, the bureau even began pre-collecting water fees from the Hujing and Houtang villages, where the water supply had not yet reached. Villagers refused to pay, and the bureau requested assistance from the marines to enforce collection using forceful methods. Subsequently, villagers elected representatives to petition the provincial government, but after several months, the matter remained unresolved. The irrigation bureau, alleging that villagers were refusing to pay water fees, fabricated accusations and, upon the representatives' return to the county, the board of directors ordered the Changle County government to arrest the representatives. This further incensed the villagers, who in June gathered several hundred people and demolished the collection office established by the bureau in Houtang village. The irrigation bureau dispatched marines to suppress the villagers, but the marines were surrounded. The villagers then purchased a large quantity of firearms from Haikou, preparing for armed resistance. The provincial government, seeing the seriousness of the situation, urgently requested political figures from Changle residing in the province to rush to mediate. They approved the suspension of water fees for villages where the water supply had not reached, and the marines were able to extricate themselves and retreat. However, the irrigation bureau, concerned that the villagers still possessed weapons, requested the provincial government to strictly order the Changle County government to confiscate the firearms (said to be around two thousand). Upon hearing this news, the villagers requested the gentry and merchants of the county town to appeal to the provincial government to retract the order and allow them to reorganize into a defense corps. The irrigation bureau then lobbied the gentry of the county town not to provide assistance (reportedly with an exchange of conditions). Consequently, the villagers' resentment toward the irrigation bureau extended to the gentry. In late last month, the provincial government, citing the villagers' resistance to orders and refusal to surrender weapons, dispatched a plane from Fuzhou to drop leaflets over the villages of Hujing and Houtang, urging them to surrender their firearms immediately, or troops would be sent to suppress them. Simultaneously, the Hong Yuankai battalion of the marines was dispatched and stationed in the mountains around Hujing and Houtang. Seeing this, the villagers became even more indignant and dug trenches and built watchtowers at the entrances of their villages and at strategic points, preparing for resistance. On the first of this month, Chen Botang, the chairman of the county chamber of commerce, went to the villages on important business. The villagers discovered him and questioned him severely. Chen's responses were unsatisfactory, and he was detained by the villagers in the Hujing village ancestral hall. The gentry of the county town were greatly alarmed upon hearing this news. County Magistrate Chen Xipeng took on the role of mediator, ordering the villagers to release the chairman of the chamber of commerce first, and then discuss other matters. The villagers demanded that the troops be withdrawn first before releasing him, leading to a stalemate. On the fifth, Battalion Commander Hong Yuankai sent two companies of soldiers into Hujing village to forcefully order the release. As soon as they reached the entrance of the village, the villagers opened fire in resistance, resulting in a major conflict. From morning to evening, both sides fought fiercely, resulting in over sixty casualties among the soldiers and over a hundred among the villagers. At night, the villagers divided into two groups and ambushed the marines' positions, capturing Battalion Commander Hong Yuankai and wounding one company commander and three platoon leaders. One company commander also went missing. The provincial government received the report on the morning of the sixth and immediately dispatched a battalion of infantry stationed in Fuqing and a battalion of artillery stationed in Lianjiang, personally led by Brigade Commander Jin Zhenzhong, to rush to the rescue. The Hai'ou gunboat was also dispatched to anchor at Zhanggang, the sea entrance of Hujing, to cut off the supply of guns and ammunition. Provincial Highway Bureau Director Chen Tiaonong and other Changle natives residing in the province, fearing the expansion of the unrest, also rushed back to their county to mediate, to prevent local devastation. But it is unknown whether they can mediate or not. (November 7)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Express News</h3>
<p>▲ Since Anhui Province banned the export of rice, smuggling and bribery have become rampant, making it almost impossible to prevent. The provincial government has now decided to establish the Anhui Rice Export Inspection Office to specifically handle rice exports. Yang Chunpu has been appointed as the director. The main office will still be located in Wuhu. Whether a branch office will be established at Dasheng Pass in the future has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>▲ According to political sources, Anhui Province is experiencing extreme financial difficulties. The autumn harvest only reached 40%. The estimated two million yuan to be collected next season has been reduced by three-fifths. The livestock slaughter tax, contracted out, only yielded over 570,000 yuan, while monthly expenditures amount to over 1.1 million yuan, resulting in a monthly deficit of as much as 300,000 yuan. The Finance Department, under pressure from various parties, is concerned about unequal distribution. It has now decided that future disbursements will be publicly announced after being jointly decided by the chairman or the provincial government.</p>
<p>▲ The measures for inspecting Japanese goods and punishing treacherous merchants in Anhui have been approved by the provincial party headquarters. Those who traffic in Japanese goods worth over 500 yuan will have all goods confiscated. The Wuhu Joint Anti-Japanese Association of Secondary Schools held a general oath-taking ceremony yesterday. Furthermore, the business community in Hefei initiated a strike due to treacherous merchants Lu Lianfu and Ding Likun trafficking in Japanese goods. The provincial party headquarters has dispatched Zeng Huanguang to Hefei to investigate. (November 10)</p>
<p>▲ Since the establishment of the special tax office in Anhui, opium has been publicly sold, resulting in extremely high tax revenues, approximately 40,000 yuan per month. Suddenly, dozens of shops selling opium publicly have appeared, displaying signs such as "New Fortune Company" and "Beneficial Company," with words indicating wholesale and retail sales. Every evening, they are brightly lit, with storytelling and singing from phonographs, creating a stark contrast with the moribund state of other industries after the flood.</p>
<p>▲ Wuhu has been assigned to raise 80,000 yuan for the Anhui road construction public bonds. Various sectors have repeatedly requested exemption due to the severe flood disaster, but without result. The provincial government has now ordered Brigade Commander Wang of the 171st Brigade stationed in Wuhu to assist in the sale. Today, County Magistrate Yu specially convened a meeting of various sectors at the county chamber of commerce to persuade them to subscribe. (November 11)</p>
<p>Local Dispatches</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The headquarters of the bandit suppression command will interrogate Fan Guozhong, the first team leader of the first district of the water police. Wei Hongxiang, a key bandit under the command of Taibao A Shu, nicknamed "Changban A He," was captured at the Shuangfeng Tea House on Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai a few days ago. After being handed over to the Minhang District Office, District Chief Xu Puren escorted him to the Bandit Suppression Division Headquarters. He will be sent to Songjiang today (the 12th), and Commander Cao will immediately propose to interrogate him. The suspect completely recanted his previous confession at the team headquarters regarding the robbery of Wang Jieshi's house, the murder of water police detective Jia Sheng, and the robbery of Sun Youfeng and other merchants in Liujia Yan. He was ordered to be detained in the county prison pending further interrogation and investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Xishan Rural Gazette reports bandit activity. Xishan Township in Wuxian County is located on the shores of Taihu Lake. Fifteen bandit boats suddenly appeared between Yuanshan Town and Lucun in the township. The inland bandits, numbering 70 or 80, were all armed and hid in the reeds. A small number of bandits went ashore to purchase rice and set up sentries along the way. The villagers were extremely frightened and urgently reported to the district office and telegraphed the county government and the Second District Water Police, ordering them to dispatch teams to suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>Lake bandits in Maqi Mountain dispersed. A large group of lake bandits was discovered in Maqi Mountain in Taihu Lake, at the intersection of Wuxi and Changzhou counties. The Shuifendun Water Police of Yixing County, the Xueyanqiao Water Police of Changzhou County, and the merchant corps were informed and went to encircle and suppress the bandits. The bandits were unable to hold their ground and retreated into the deep mountains, gathering on the summit, adopting a commanding position to resist the police and merchant corps. Due to the terrain, the police and merchant corps urgently reported to the Xueyanqiao merchant corps. It is now known that at 3:00 PM on the day before yesterday (the 11th), the Eighth District Defense Corps of Wujin and the Defense Corps from Zhouqiao, Panjiaqiao, and other places, totaling over 200 police and militia, led by Water Police Team Leader Li Guozhen as the temporary commander of bandit suppression, divided into teams to advance into the mountains and suppress the bandits. After five hours of fighting, the bandits were routed. Two bandits were captured on the spot, one of whom had a gunshot wound in the shoulder, with the bullet exiting his back. He was from Chaohu, Anhui. Two hostages were also left behind. The remaining lake bandits fled into Taihu Lake with hostages. It is reported that this group of lake bandits was formed by a combination of gangs from Pudong, Hunan, and Chaohu. The Chaohu gang suffered the heaviest losses this time. When the police team repelled the lake bandits, they also seized two Mauser pistols. All seven rescued hostages, including Zou Amao, Zheng Genyun, Wang Ayu, and boatmen, were immediately taken to the Tenth Team of the Wujin Water Police and transferred to the Second District Office of the Water Police in this county to await disposition.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>The case of the party committee being accused of defrauding money is heard again. Shi Minyong, a supervisory committee member of the county party headquarters, was accused by party member Tong Shizhong of taking advantage of his party position to defraud and obtain money. After Qian Yu, a prosecutor from the Wuxian County District Court, filed a public lawsuit, a court hearing was held once. The Wuxian Court held a third hearing on the 11th. At 4:00 PM, Judge Yang Yihu questioned the witnesses. Hu Jianxin and Liu Bingshu did not arrive. Liu Jianbai was questioned, and he testified that Shi Minyong had not demanded 300 yuan from him, and as for the handwritten letter, it was a moment of confusion and he was deceived by Hu Jianxin. At this point, the plaintiff Tong Shizhong retorted, saying that Liu is an intellectual and has served as a bureau director in the Executive Yuan. How could he be fooled by others? It is obvious that his testimony is not accurate. Witness Shen Zhifang was also questioned. He is from Shazhou City and is from the same hometown as Shi. His words were biased in favor of Shi, and most of them were refuted by the judge. The judge then adjourned the court and ordered Hu Jianxin to be summoned before making a judgment. The plaintiff also applied to summon lawyer Di Rou as an additional witness, because Liu Jianbai had asked him to draft a statement, and new evidence was discovered there. The judge approved the request. The defendant Shi Minyong remains on bail of 800 yuan in cash to await trial.</p>
<p>The case of the female principal's unexplained death is scheduled for hearing. The case of Hu Tinglian, the female principal of Yanxiang Elementary School in this county, who died under unclear circumstances, was reported to the county judiciary by her brother, Hu Tianpu, after he detained a suspect, Wu Xiaosheng. After an initial investigation, the county government believed it was necessary to investigate further and scheduled a public hearing for the afternoon of the 21st of this month. Many witnesses have been summoned, including the plaintiff Hu Tianpu and the defendant Wu Xiaosheng, as well as female school worker Wang Yinshi, village constable Zhou Xiguan, and Zhou Jingfang, the wife of the director of Huakang Hospital (Zhou had a teacher-student relationship with the deceased and went to the village to attend the funeral after her death. It is alleged that the hospital provided ten white pills before Hu's death, which are suspected to be abortion pills, but Zhou claims that the white pills were aspirin for treating headaches, so her testimony is necessary), a Mr. who substituted as Hu's teacher, the gravedigger who handled the burial, and traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Wang Xiangjiu (Wang was hired by Wu Xiaosheng to visit Hu and examine her two days before her death and wrote a prescription, so he is also on the list of those summoned). It is expected that this case will cause a sensation throughout the city, and the public hearing will definitely attract the attention of the public.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Request for exemption from grain tax for disaster-stricken farmland. The canals and sandy fields of Jiangyin suffered flood damage this year. The provincial authorities have dispatched personnel to investigate and have ordered the Finance Bureau to handle the disaster relief procedures in accordance with the regulations of the 18th year. They have instructed the district scribes to rush to prepare the list of names of disaster-stricken farmers for the farmland and report to the county for submission to the provincial authorities for grain tax exemption. The total area of disaster-stricken farmland in all 36 townships of the county is 248 sections, with a total of 180,647.5 mu of farmland with no harvest and 39,354.21 mu of farmland with reduced harvest.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The case of corruption in the collection of grain tax is being investigated. The Nantong County Finance Bureau discovered significant corruption in the collection of grain tax. Li Baosheng and others involved have been detained by the Finance Department, and the coupon booklets from previous years have been sent to the department for investigation. The dark secrets are expected to be fully revealed within half a month.</p>
<p>The army and navy jointly suppress sea bandits. Large groups of sea bandits have recently been raiding the coastal areas of Tongzhou and Rugao in northern Jiangsu. The pacification troops stationed in Tongzhou and the naval vessels dispatched by the Ministry of the Navy are jointly conducting suppression operations. The county police force and the defense corps are responsible for blocking and intercepting fleeing bandits, sealing off coastal ports, and cutting off the supply of food and fodder to the bandit ships.</p>
<p>The provincial committee demands a special construction fund. Shen Baoquan and Yu Naisu were commissioned by the Finance and Construction Departments of the provincial government to come to Tongzhou to demand half of the special construction fund for the purpose of purchasing government bonds for water management and transportation. Local agencies opposed it. After mediation by the county government, 5,000 yuan was taken.</p>
<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<h3>Letter from the Anhui Department of Education</h3>
<p>Jing: Recently, I read a news item titled "The First Step in the Handling of Disputes in the Education Sector by Party and Government Agencies" in the Anqing Correspondence column of your newspaper on October 31, which contains many inaccuracies. In the spring of this year, our department requested the provincial government to select Mao Baoheng, the principal of a vocational school, Yang Zhongming, the chief of the First Division of our department, Cheng Mianwu, the principal of a girls' middle school, and Shu Dejin, the principal of a girls' middle school, to go abroad to study education. Subsequently, these individuals successively requested to go abroad. However, because the positions held by these individuals were all important, it was not possible to find suitable replacements for the time being, and they were separately instructed to postpone their departures. The travel expenses were not claimed. Later, Cao Juesheng, the editor-in-chief of Education New Journal, was unaware of the truth of the matter and attacked many educational administrators in our province. The provincial party headquarters issued a letter to the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital to ban the journal, stating that the journal was full of words inciting student unrest and indiscriminate criticism, which was wrong and should be strictly banned in order to correct public opinion. The cancellation of the Provincial United School Association is a separate matter and is not related to this matter and should not be discussed together. Fearing that distant rumors may be inaccurate, we have specifically sent this letter to inform you of the course of events, hoping that you will publish the original letter in your newspaper to make corrections. Sincerely, the Secretariat of the Anhui Department of Education, November 9.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Hope for Peaceful Reunification</h3>
<p>Since the violent invasion of the Northeast by Japan, the Shanghai education community has unanimously believed that without seeking peaceful reunification within the country, it will be insufficient to resist foreign aggression. It is learned that recently, large, medium, and small schools in Shanghai have been gathering teachers and students on campus to hold meetings to promote peaceful reunification. After the meeting, each student personally wrote a letter to the representatives of the Peaceful Reunification Conference, expressing their hope that peaceful reunification will be realized soon.

<p>The Intellectual Education Department of the YMCA in this city has launched a speech competition on the Northeast problem for students from various universities in Shanghai.

However, using this kind of patriotic enthusiasm to cope with the current emergency is acceptable, but it is not necessarily a permanent and thorough solution. There are many outstanding issues between China and Japan regarding the three northeastern provinces, and even if this incident can be resolved satisfactorily, we cannot guarantee that the same thing will not happen again. We hope that young comrades with considerable education can painstakingly study the Northeast problem and then contribute practical solutions to solve all outstanding issues and various problems. This is the purpose of the YMCA's Intellectual Education Department in launching this speech competition. The brief rules are as follows: (1) Topic: How to Solve the Northeast Problem (2) Qualifications: All students from universities in Shanghai are eligible to participate, but they must have a certificate from the school authorities when registering (3) Registration: From now until November 15, register at the Intellectual Education Department of the YMCA, 201 North Fourth Road (4) Date: 2:00 PM on November 21 (5) Judges: Ma Xiangbo, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Peihuang (6) Prizes: The first, second, and third prizes will be issued with donations from Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Qun, and Yu Qiaqing (7) Prizes: First place: a silver cup, second place: a large silver shield, third place: a medium silver shield (8) Time limit: Each speaker is limited to 20 minutes.</p>

<h3>Students Studying at Military Academies in Japan Go to Beijing to Petition</h3>
<p>▲ Request the Training Supervision Department to Find Ways to Continue Their Studies</p>
<p>Students studying at military academies in Japan returned to China and temporarily resided at the Baxianlou. The new address of the association, because the association is located in the concession, which is not conducive to anti-Japanese work, has been interfered with by the police. Therefore, it is planned to move to a new address. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, 64 students from the association gathered at the North Railway Station to go to Beijing to petition the Training Supervision Department and the Ministry of Education to complete their studies as the ultimate goal, and to provide appropriate economic assistance. At the same time, they will intensify anti-Japanese national salvation work in Beijing to fulfill their original intention of returning to China after dropping out of school. The train tickets were issued by the municipal government for all party members. Some of them postponed their trip to Beijing due to personal matters, and some of them had already gone to Beijing in advance.</p>
<h3>Students Returning from Japan Study Violent Japan</h3>
<p>▲ Exposing Weekly Published Yesterday ▲ Schools and Institutions Can Request Copies</p>
<p>The General Association of Chinese Students Studying in Japan and the Shanghai Branch still have their headquarters at Huadong Apartment on Malong Road.

<h3>Celebrations Held by All Circles Yesterday to Commemorate the Premier's Birthday</h3>
<p>▲ And Celebrate the Opening of the Fourth National Congress</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 66th anniversary of the birthday of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the opening of the Fourth National Congress. The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department specially convened people from all walks of life in the city to hold a celebration of the Premier's birthday and the opening of the Fourth National Congress at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce at Tianhougong Bridge. More than 100 representatives from all walks of life attended that day. The presidium consisted of Tao Baichuan, Zhang Qun, Xiong Shihui, Li Yuanzhang, Hu Shuhua, Wang Xiaolai, Lu Jingshi, and other seven people. Hu Shuhua reported on the significance of celebrating the Premier's birthday and the efforts that we should make. Chen Kecheng and Li Yuanzhang then gave speeches successively. The meeting was adjourned after chanting slogans. The details of the meeting and the commemorative activities in various districts are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>▲ Meeting Order (1) Play music; (2) All stand at attention; (3) Sing the Party song; (4) Pay the highest respect to the Party and national flag and the Premier's portrait; (5) The chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will; (6) Silent mourning; (7) Chairman's report; (8) Speech; (9) Chant slogans; (10) Play music; (11) Ceremony completed</p>
<p>▲ More than 600 representatives from various agencies, groups, schools, and trade unions attended the meeting.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Report: Representatives, today is the anniversary of the birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the opening day of the Fourth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang. In the double celebration, we feel infinitely excited. Representatives brave the rain to participate, which shows the greatness of the Premier's personality, which can inspire the general public and comrades at any time and at any moment. The Premier was born in the fifth year of Tongzhi. After 60 years of hard work, the Republic of China was born, and the evil Qing Dynasty was overthrown. Although the Premier died with his ambition, he did not see his ambitions fully realized with his own eyes. However, his spirit and his doctrine always shine in the world, giving people worship and admiration. The Chinese Kuomintang was created by the Premier alone. He assumed the responsibility of building, saving, and governing the country. The party members naturally regard the completion of the Premier's will as their only duty. Therefore, the central government launched the Northern Expedition, established a party-ruled national government, and eliminated the new and old warlords who betrayed the party and sold the country, seeking a thorough removal of obstacles to the party and the country. The Republic of China has become increasingly difficult to this day, and the party's responsibility has become heavier. Therefore, today, in commemorating the Premier's birthday, we can only emulate the Premier's great fearless spirit and pure and great personality, and go to the national crisis together. The Fourth National Congress seeks to resolve the internal disputes of the party, then the day of peace and unity is the time to unanimously resist foreign enemies. The time to unanimously resist foreign enemies is the time to eliminate the national crisis. I hope that the representatives present will work hard.</p>
<p>▲ Meeting Slogans (1) Celebrate the birthday of the great Premier; (2) The Premier is the savior of China; (3) The Premier is the revolutionary mentor; (4) Complete the Premier's legacy; (5) Promote political tutelage and construction; (6) Support the Fourth National Congress; (7) Relieve the suffering of the people; (8) Abolish all unequal treaties; (9) Overthrow Japanese imperialism; (10) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang; (11) Long live the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>The US General Branch Does Not Send Representatives to Attend the Fourth National Congress</h3>
<p>▲ Because of Time Constraints, It Is Too Late to Elect Representatives</p>
<p>In the current peace and reunification process, the US General Branch has been the most active in mediation among overseas party departments. Now the peace conference has been completed, and cooperation between Beijing and Guangdong can be realized. The US General Branch had a telegram sent to Shanghai yesterday (12th), addressed to a certain important person, expressing its relief. It also stated that the Fourth National Congress of both Beijing and Guangdong will open soon. Due to time constraints, it is too late to elect representatives. It has been decided that neither side's Fourth National Congress will send representatives to attend.</p>
<h3>Gao Lu Elaborates on the International Police Proposal</h3>
<p>▲The League of Nations Should Not Undermine China's Independence</p>
<p>The National News Agency, Geneva, 10th: Regarding the proposal by some within the League of Nations to organize a police force to maintain order in Liaoning and Jilin, a reporter yesterday encountered Mr. Gao Lu, former French envoy and current Legislative Yuan member, and discussed the matter. Gao said, "I believe this is inaccurate. If it were true, it would be the League of Nations aiding the wicked. Instead of letting China be destroyed by Japan, it would be placing China under the rule of the League of Nations." He continued, "Brutal Japan is employing sophistry, fabricating facts, disregarding treaties, and invading another country. Considering the standing of the major powers within the League of Nations, they have been unable to restrain Japan from repeatedly disrupting China's internal public safety in the past two months, nor have they been able to compel Japan to withdraw its troops as scheduled according to the two resolutions. Now, to implement one of the Twenty-One Demands to the detriment of China's independence and freedom, even a foolish Chinese government would not blindly follow such a course."</p>
<p>The telegram also stated, "The League of Nations police could be jointly dispatched by countries striving for peace in the Far East, or even organized from the foreign troops currently stationed in China. Their primary task would be to protect the South Manchurian Railway and the lives and property of Japanese residents." Such absurd arguments are truly alarming. The South Manchurian Railway has not suffered any damage whatsoever. Brutal Japan is fabricating facts to justify its military intervention. Even if, after withdrawing its troops, brutal Japan intended to reinstate its railway guard along the South Manchurian Railway, China has not yet raised any objection. As for the lives and property of Japanese residents, they have not suffered any harm to date. I do not understand why Japanese residents should have a special status, requiring protection by an international police force. In the future, foreign residents in China from all countries will make the same demand. China would have no argument against it, and what grounds would the international community have to justify it? I believe that although the League of Nations may struggle to deal with irregular actions by Japan, it would not go so far as to make statements undermining an independent country."</p>
<h3>Various Circles Telegraph Condolences to Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>▲The Second District Party Department Telegraphs</p>
<p>The Second District Party Department, yesterday, telegraphed to the Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, Ma Zhanshan, saying: "The nation is in crisis. Please inform Deputy Commander Zhang's Headquarters in Beiping to forward to Acting Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang Province, and all officers and soldiers: This time, with brutal Japan invading Heilongjiang Province, our officers and soldiers have bravely risen up, killing the enemy and avenging our grievances, washing away the shame of non-resistance, and reviving the spirit of our nation. Upon hearing this news, we are deeply impressed and admire you. In addition to telegraphing the central government to order the military authorities to dispatch troops for reinforcements, we specifically send this telegram of condolence, and hope that you will continue your efforts." (Omitted below)</p>
<p>▲The Protect the Party Comrades Association Telegraphs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shen Bao Newspaper Office to forward to General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province: "Brutal Japan is cunning and has brought disaster to our Northeast. They harbored disdain first, and then dared to commit injustice. General, with a small force, you have defended against the enemy, taking them by surprise, blunting their edge and destroying their strength. The news of your victories resounds everywhere, and the mountains and rivers are filled with spirit. We believe that deploying troops is for defending the nation, and killing the enemy is for ending war. If the flames of aggression are not extinguished, they will grow stronger. Previous leaders have been fearful and tolerant. Now, General, you have achieved the first victory, which will surely embolden all other commanders. The hearts of those who were resigned to death in all areas will be greatly encouraged. However, the enemy, having suffered a major defeat, will surely seek revenge. In military strategy, it is easier to win battles than to maintain victory. We implore General to uphold the great righteousness of resisting foreign aggression as exemplified in the Spring and Autumn Annals. Even if you encounter difficulties, strive to overcome them. The spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen will surely protect you. In the future, when we recover our territory and restore the glory of the Han people, General's achievements will be remembered for centuries. We specially send this telegram to convey our respect and wish you well. The Protect the Party Comrades Association of the Chinese Nationalist Party, bows in respect."</p>
<p>▲The Lawyers Association Telegraphs</p>
<p>The National Government: "Brutal Japan has invaded Heilongjiang, and fortunately, the Chairman of the province, Ma Zhanshan, has devoted his life to the frontier, and the enemy has not succeeded. However, the military strength of Heilongjiang is weak, and the situation is precarious. One tree cannot support a collapsing structure. We earnestly request the government to quickly provide reinforcements, so that the resistance fighters, the only remaining hope in the eastern provinces, are not left isolated. This urgent telegram conveys our eager anticipation. The Shanghai Lawyers Association, bows in respect."</p>
<p>▲The Economic Anti-Japanese Group Telegraphs</p>
<p>The Economic National Salvation Anti-Japanese Group telegraphed, saying: "To Acting Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang Province: Since the Japanese bandits invaded, the entire country has been shaken. In the Nenjiang campaign, your Excellency planned and directed the resistance, beheading the leaders of the rebellious bandits and shattering the courage of the prime culprits. The news of your victories has spread, and we rejoice with raised hands. Your loyalty, bravery, and integrity will shine for a thousand years. We hope that you will continue to cultivate virtue and eradicate evil completely. We, though lacking in ability, pledge to be your backing. We respectfully send this telegram of condolence, requesting your consideration. The Economic National Salvation Anti-Japanese Group, bows in respect."</p>

<h3>Japanese Cotton Mills Hold Delegates' Conference Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Discussing Methods for Suspending Work and Starting Operations</p>
<p>The New Times Agency reports: The Japanese Cotton Mill Owners Association in China convened an emergency committee in Osaka on the 11th, and resolved that all cotton mills in China should unanimously reduce their work by 20%. The Japanese Cotton Mill Association in Shanghai has already received this telegram, and held an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss the matter. Generally, since all sectors of our country have unanimously and voluntarily engaged in anti-Japanese national salvation, the first to bear the brunt is Japanese cotton. At the beginning of the boycott of Japanese goods, there were still one or two treacherous merchants in our country who, seeking profits, privately ordered Japanese cotton from Japanese cotton mills. Therefore, the Japanese side was quite calm at the time, and even recruited new workers, making every effort to rush production. Later, as Chinese workers in Japanese factories, out of strong patriotism, voluntarily resigned, and our textile industry became very serious about inspecting Japanese goods, even those treacherous merchants who had ordered cotton yarn from Japanese factories had to sacrifice their deposits and terminate their contracts with the Japanese side because they could not smuggle the goods. Consequently, the Japanese factories began to panic, and convened joint meetings to discuss countermeasures. Although they all unanimously advocated temporarily suspending work to await the opportune moment, the various factories were still hesitant about this decision. Except for those factories that could not operate due to the withdrawal of Chinese workers, the others were still struggling to maintain operations. Yesterday, after the Japanese Cotton Mill Association received the telegram from Osaka, resolving to reduce work by 20%, it convened an emergency meeting of all Japanese cotton mills in Shanghai on the same day for careful consideration. More than 20 representatives from various factories attended, and they all agreed that it would be better to temporarily suspend work altogether than to reduce work by 20%, in order to save expenses. Otherwise, even if work were reduced by 20%, no one would buy the products, and expenses could not be saved. The decision was unanimously approved by the Japanese factory representatives present. Moreover, Takei Kanzou, Chairman of the Japanese Cotton Mill Owners Association in China, also sent a telegram to the Japanese Cotton Mill Association in Shanghai yesterday, reporting that he had departed from Osaka yesterday to come to Shanghai and discuss the suspension of work with the Japanese cotton mill representatives in Shanghai. Therefore, the exact date for announcing the suspension of work will be decided after Takei arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Three Japanese Consulates Temporarily Closed</h3>
<p>▲Three Consuls Have Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Continental News reports: The Japanese Consul in Chongqing, Masano; the Japanese Consul-General in Chengdu, Abe; and the Japanese Consul in Zhengzhou, Tanaka, have temporarily closed their consulates and arrived in Shanghai yesterday (11th) aboard the Zuiyo Maru. It is reported that the three will remain in Shanghai temporarily. As for the Japanese residents in the three ports, all have left.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Decides on Measures for Suspension of Japanese Ships in China</h3>
<p>▲Current Japanese Ships to Reduce Half of Their Schedules</p>
<p>▲Coastal Japanese Ships Reduce Their Schedules Japanese merchant ships in China are roughly divided into two types: those receiving government subsidies, which are formal liners, called "ordered ships," and those not receiving subsidies, which are "wild chicken" ships. For example, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Osaka Shosen Kaisha, and Nissin Kisen Kaisha in this port all receive subsidies from the Japanese government, while Mitsui, Kawasaki, and Yamashita ships are not formal liners. Since the start of the anti-Japanese incident, in addition to Japanese ships on the Yangtze River line that have already suspended their schedules, some non-formal liner Japanese ships on the North and South Pacific routes have also suspended operations. Most of the ships still operating are formal liners. Recently, various shipping companies have been suffering losses due to lack of business and are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain operations. However, since they have government subsidies, they are reluctant to suspend their schedules without permission. They have agreed to telegraph Tokyo to request instructions. Now, there is reliable news that the Japanese Ministry of Communications has replied to Shanghai, ordering all shipping companies' merchant ships in China, regardless of North or South Pacific routes, to first suspend half of their schedules. The laid-up ships will dismiss their employees temporarily for a period of six months. After receiving the order, various shipping companies are immediately making preparations, and it is expected to be implemented next week. At that time, a large number of Chinese employees in Shanghai will lose their jobs.</p>
<p>▲NYK Reduces Ships on China-Japan Lines Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) has already reduced the Tsukuba Maru and Taian Maru from the China-Japan lines. Three ships remain on the Yokohama-Shanghai route and four ships on the Shanghai-Hanshin route. Recently, business on this route has been poor, with only 20% to 30% of the imports and no exports at all. In recent voyages, the ships have only been carrying wheat bran. The decline in business is unprecedented, and the future is bleak. As a result of discussions, NYK plans to reduce one ship on the Yokohama line and two ships on the Hanshin line, leaving five ships operating between China and Japan.</p>
<p>▲Mitsui Only Sends One Ship Mitsui Bussan's Pacific route originally had four ships operating, and two new ships were added this year, sailing from North America to northern China to load cargo. Now, due to the impact of the boycott, there is no cargo to load in northern China. Only Dalian and Qingdao have some commissions. Therefore, it has been decided that only one ship will be sent to the Pacific from northern China this winter. The Hakone Maru is scheduled to sail on December 3rd, and the rest will not come to China.</p>
<p>▲Goods Shipped to Tianjin Greatly Reduced The Japanese instigated the Tianjin unrest, claiming it was to protect Japanese residents, and dispatched warships to Tianjin on this pretext, creating a very dangerous situation. Recently, the cruiser "Yakumo" was dispatched, carrying a large contingent of marines, and will arrive soon from Yokosuka. The people of Tianjin are increasingly panicked. The Tianjin guilds have sent a special telegram to Shanghai reporting that, except for necessary items such as food, other large shipments of goods have been temporarily suspended. After this telegram arrived in Shanghai, the export of goods to Tianjin from this port has been greatly reduced. Foreign ships arriving in Tianjin now only go as far as Tanggu, and no longer sail into the Baihe River. Of the Chinese ships sailing to Tianjin, there are currently only three operating.</p>
<h3>The "Minsheng" Warship Sailed to the Capital Yesterday for the Naval Review</h3>
<p>▲Captain Zheng Gongyao Took Office Yesterday</p>
<p>The captain of the Second Fleet's new "Minsheng" warship, Zheng Gongyao, and the vice-captain, Nie Xiyu, held their swearing-in ceremony on the ship yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Commander of the First Fleet, Chen Jiliang, represented the naval headquarters in administering the oath. At the same time, the ship held a flag-raising ceremony, which was completed at 10:00 AM. At 1:30 PM in the afternoon, the ship set sail on its maiden voyage to the capital's Baguazhou to participate in the naval review. Furthermore, the naval Hubei-type torpedo boat, which came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday, arrived at the port yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Pilot Examination Not Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the pilot examination, which was originally scheduled to be held yesterday, it was suddenly postponed again. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Repeated Postponements of the Examination The Navy Department has repeatedly received petitions from pilots requesting that the examination be held to lay the groundwork for the recovery of pilotage rights. However, because the matter is of great importance, the examination procedures and organization must be as perfect as possible in order to be effective. The examination was originally scheduled for September 15th, but was changed to October 1st, and then postponed again to yesterday, but it still failed to materialize.</p>
<p>▲Reasons for the Postponement The reason for the repeated postponements of the pilot examination this time is that last month, the Navy Department was ordered to include the General Staff Headquarters, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Transportation in the process, in order to ensure careful consideration. Consequently, the above four ministries jointly formed a Pilot Examination Committee to be responsible for handling the matter. The repeated examination dates and various examination procedures are also handled by the committee. However, the previously determined dates and procedures must be reported to the Examination Yuan and the Examination Selection Committee for submission to the National Government for approval before the examination can be held. Recently, due to the tense situation and serious diplomatic issues, the matter has been implicitly delayed. This is the main reason why it could not be held as scheduled.</p>
<p>▲Number of Pilots The number of pilots taking the examination this time is 327 for the Yangtze River (including Shanghai to Hankou), and more than 40 for the South Channel (i.e., Shanghai to Tongsha). However, foreigners are in the majority in this area. The most important work of a pilot is to guide ships into the harbor, turn around, and dock at the pier. In the past, many Chinese people were responsible for this work. Over the years, due to technical deficiencies, they have been repeatedly eliminated by the Customs Marine Office through examinations. Now, there is only one remaining. This is truly sad. However, since the Customs Marine Office is staffed by foreigners, there is a connection to why Chinese people are being eliminated.</p>
<p>▲Personnel from Various Ministries Regarding the personnel from various ministries required to participate in the Pilot Examination Committee, it is reported that the Ministry of Transportation will appoint Xi Dingmo, Director of the Shanghai Navigation Administration, and Xia Yingkang, a technician. The Navy Department is said to have appointed Wu Guangzong, Director of the Hydrographic Office, and Yu Zhengxing, Director of the Pilot Training Institute. As for the representatives from the General Staff Headquarters, the Ministry of Finance, the Examination Yuan, and the Examination Selection Committee, their identities are not yet known.</p>
<h3>Current whereabouts of People</h3>
<p>▲French Envoy Wilden Departed for Beijing by Overnight Express Train Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Chen Mingshu Departed Beijing by Overnight Express Train Yesterday, Arriving in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<h3>Change in Calculation of Navigation Degree</h3>
<p>▲Changed to Starting at True North Zero Degrees</p>
<p>The Maritime Affairs Department of the Inspectorate General of Customs issued a navigation announcement stating: (No. 1018) Announcement: As instructed by the Inspector General of Customs, it has been determined that the directions and courses published in the department's announcements and various publications have previously been calculated according to the magnetic meridian (compass direction). From the 11th of this year, all subsequent announcements and publications will change the aforementioned degrees to start at true north zero degrees and calculate clockwise to 359 degrees, unless otherwise specified. Therefore, all Chinese and foreign shipping merchants are hereby notified. This is announced on November 7th of the 20th year of the Republic of China by Yuan Liman of the Maritime Affairs Department of the Inspectorate General of Customs.</p>
<h3>Request for Allocation of Vessels for the Songcheng Section Survey</h3>
<p>▲Request for Subsidy for Survey Expenses</p>
<p>Since the right to survey the Songcheng section, which was formerly handled by the Customs, was formally transferred to the Hydrographic Office, the "Zhuantiao" and "Lijin" vessels, which were used by the Customs for surveys, have now been converted for anti-smuggling and lighthouse beacon patrol purposes. Therefore, the Hydrographic Office has submitted a request to the Navy Department for the allocation of vessels to be used for surveying. Furthermore, regarding the funds required for the Songcheng section survey, since the Hydrographic Office took over, the amount promised by the Customs has been less than the amount used when the Customs handled it. Therefore, the Hydrographic Office has also submitted a request to the Navy Department to negotiate with the Ministry of Finance for a prompt subsidy to facilitate the survey.</p>
<h3>Explanation by the Executive Yuan Regarding Opinions on the Factory Law in this City</h3>
<p>▲ The Social Affairs Bureau's Request for Instructions Comprises Seventeen Items ▲ All but Two Items Are Handled According to the Ministry's Deliberations</p>
<p>Since the promulgation and implementation of the Factory Law, the Social Affairs Bureau of this city has noted that factories in this city are numerous and their organization is extremely complex. The implementation regulations of the Factory Law often encounter practical difficulties due to environmental constraints. Various factories have offered interpretations. In addition to the Bureau dispatching personnel to provide guidance, seventeen points that are not easily resolved, based on the various articles of the law and considering the industrial situation of this city, have been presented, annotated article by article by the Municipal Government, and forwarded to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan then sent them to the Ministry of Industry for review. It is now reported that the Executive Yuan has submitted the Ministry of Industry's review opinions to the 43rd National Affairs Meeting for resolution. Except for Articles 18 and 45 (original text detailed below), which should be forwarded to the National Government for approval, the remaining items are to be handled according to the Ministry's deliberations. The Executive Yuan will then issue an order to the Municipal Government of this city, instructing it to notify the relevant parties. The various opinions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The Social Affairs Bureau's Opinion Paper: The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Request for Interpretation of the Implementation of the Factory Law and its Implementation Regulations. Article 1, Original Text: "This law applies to factories that use steam power, electric power, or hydraulic power to drive machinery and regularly employ thirty or more workers." (1) If the part of the factory that uses steam power or electric power to drive machinery is extremely small, while the majority of the work is done by human power, and the number of employees is thirty or more, does this law apply? If it must apply, and the factory is being evasive by dividing the work done by machinery and the work done by human power into two separate factories, with the number of workers in the machine-powered part being less than thirty, in order to avoid the obligations of this law, how should this be handled? For example, in a weaving factory, the looms can be powered by either human or electric power. In a factory using electric-powered looms, there are only three or four machines, with fewer than thirty workers. The remaining looms are powered by human power, and the number of workers exceeds thirty. Does this law apply to such a factory? (2) The meaning of the four words "employ workers" is very broad. Are gatekeepers, cooks, janitors, etc., also included in the count? (3) Do temporary workers, contract workers, piece-rate workers, day-rate workers, and mobile workers, such as substitutes, all fall under the application of this law? This is Question 1. Article 3, Paragraph 2, "Registration of the month and year of employment of workers." Many long-term workers in existing factories have been employed for a very long time, and the factory has no records to verify. The workers also cannot recall the exact date, month, and year, and they generally have no guarantors who can confirm this. How should the factories be instructed to handle the registration when the month and year of entry into the factory of these long-term workers cannot be verified? This is Question 2. Article 4, Paragraph 2, "Workers' injuries, illnesses, and their treatment." A report should be submitted to the competent authority once every six months. Does "injuries and illnesses" refer specifically to those caused by the performance of duties, or does it refer to all injuries and illnesses? This is Question 3. Article 10, "Work hours may be extended due to natural disasters, incidents, or seasonal factors." Also, Article 6 of the Implementation Regulations, "When extending work hours, the reasons should be detailed and reported to the competent authority." Should this report be submitted in advance? If so, factories are sometimes busy and need to rush out goods within two or three days. Sometimes, raw materials cannot be stored for long due to weather conditions and must be used up within one or two days, or other circumstances require a temporary extension of work hours. If there is not enough time for prior reporting, what remedies are available? This is Question 4. Article 11, "The daily work hours of child laborers shall not exceed eight hours." The work of adult workers in factories sometimes requires the cooperation of child laborers. If the child laborers stop working, the adult workers' work may also be halted. If the working period set by the factory is ten hours, and child laborers cannot exceed eight hours, should this situation be accommodated? This is Question 5. Article 13, "Female workers shall not work between the hours of 10 PM and 6 AM the following morning." In various industries such as silk factories, silk weaving factories, yarn factories, and weaving factories, considering the interests of the workers and the capabilities of the factories, implementing this article in the shortest period of time seems difficult. How should this be remedied? This is Question 6. Article 15, "Every worker shall have one day of rest in every seven days." Also, in conjunction with the provision in Article 18 that wages are paid as usual on rest days, does "seven days" refer to the actual number of consecutive working days, or are days of leave and holidays also counted? As for paying wages as usual on rest days, there is no major issue for workers paid on a monthly basis. However, if piece-rate workers are paid according to the law, factories will feel the loss, and the wage standard will inevitably be lowered, resulting in a reduction in the workers' income. Moreover, how should the wage standard for rest days be determined? Regulations should be stipulated. This is Question 7. Article 17, "Workers who have worked continuously in a factory for a certain period of time shall have special leave." If this special leave is determined by the workers themselves, the workers may suddenly stop working and rest during busy periods, or the workers in crucial positions may rest at the same time, causing all the workers in the factory to stop working, resulting in great losses for the factory. Can the factory designate these special holidays in rotation according to the number of days to facilitate adjustment? This is Question 8. Article 18, "Wages shall be paid as usual for rest days and holidays stipulated in Articles 15 to 17. If a worker does not want to take special leave, they shall be paid additional wages for that holiday period." (1) If the factory does not want work to stop during busy periods, can it force workers to work during the holiday period by paying double wages? (2) Paying wages as usual during the holiday period presents particular difficulties for the silk weaving industry. Because the profits of textile factories are very thin, and the factory already suffers a great loss from giving an average of sixty days of leave throughout the year, if wages are paid as usual again, the factories may close down one after another. Therefore, can this article be specially accommodated for the silk weaving industry? (3) Do piece-rate, day-rate, or temporary workers also fully enjoy the rights under this article, or are they only limited to enjoying the right to be paid wages as usual on commemorative holidays under Article 16? This is Question 9. Article 25, "Factories shall not deduct wages from workers in advance, such as for breach of contract or compensation." It is common practice for factories to require workers to provide a deposit when they enter the factory to perform important work. The Factory Law does not explicitly prohibit this. If factories still collect deposits, and workers do not have the funds to pay, according to current practice, the workers voluntarily have a certain percentage deducted from their monthly wages as a deposit until the full amount is reached. If according to the provisions of this law, workers who are unable to pay may lose their jobs or resort to borrowing money at high interest rates. Can this be accommodated with the consent of the workers? This is Question 10. Article 32, "A worker who has an indefinite-term work contract and wishes to terminate the contract shall give the factory one week's notice." If a worker terminates the contract at any time without giving one week's notice, and the factory suffers a loss as a result, can compensation be requested? There is no explicit provision for this in the law. Can it be permitted to stipulate this in the contract? This is Question 11. Article 37, "Female workers shall stop working for a total of eight weeks before and after childbirth, with wages paid as usual." (1) Eight weeks of rest seems too long in terms of the female worker's own physiology. Women of the propertied class may not even take more than six weeks of rest before and after childbirth. Can this be changed to six weeks to alleviate the difficulties of the factory? (2) Paying wages as usual during this period of rest also feels beyond the factory's capabilities. Because most female workers are between the ages of twenty and thirty, the fertility rate is very high. If wages are paid in full, the factory will not be able to bear the burden and will inevitably not employ young women, resulting in female unemployment. Therefore, to balance the interests of both parties, can it be changed to allow the factory to discretionarily subsidize the female worker with a certain percentage of her wages? Also, if a female worker becomes pregnant for reasons other than marriage, is the factory obligated to do this? This is Question 12. Article 45, "If a worker is injured or becomes ill or dies while performing their duties, the factory shall provide medical subsidies and compensation." (1) The boundaries of the four words "performing their duties" are not clear, and the meaning of the two words "injury and illness" also seems unclear. It is obvious if a worker is injured while working. However, if they become ill, if there is no standard, it will lead to far-fetched interpretations, not only will the workers be misunderstood, but it will also easily cause disputes. Therefore, it seems necessary to clearly define what kind of illness is caused by performing duties. (2) Can the amount of compensation be allowed to be graded according to the amount of capital, giving different amounts? Although the regulations stipulate that those with capital under 50,000 yuan may submit a request to the competent authority to reduce the amount given, this provision seems to be divided into more grades for convenience. If a worker dies while performing their duties, based on an average monthly wage of 30 yuan, the average wage for two years is 720 yuan, plus funeral expenses of 50 yuan and family bereavement expenses of 300 yuan, totaling 1,070 yuan. Those with capital of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan may not be able to bear the burden. Also, if a delivery worker is suddenly run over by a tram or car on the road and dies, even though it is caused by performing their duties, the responsibility for this death may be due to the driver's negligence or the worker's own carelessness. In this situation, how should the factory be responsible? If the factory sues the worker in court, and the court rules that it was caused by the worker's own carelessness, or the compensation ruled by the court is less than the amount that the worker should receive under the Factory Law, should the factory compensate or ignore it? This is Question 13. Article 51, "If the matters listed in the preceding article cannot be resolved, or involve matters of two or more factories, they shall be handled by the factory council." On the surface, the two words "handled" in this article seem to place all factory matters under the control of labor-management consultation. This will not only hinder the factory's management rights, but also affect the business plan. It seems appropriate to explain this to avoid misinterpretations. This is Question 14. Article 54, "The number of worker representatives and factory representatives in the factory council shall be limited to five to nine people each." (1) If the factory representatives in the factory council are limited to the factory director, manager, and deputy manager, the number of factory representatives will be insufficient. If the factory selects representatives from among the staff, in a broad sense, the staff are also employed workers. Can the factory select factory representatives from among the staff? (2) If the factory is small in scope and the conditions happen to meet the requirements of the Factory Law, a factory council must be organized. If all the factory staff are counted and the number is less than five, can the number of representatives be reduced? (3) Most of the workers in silk factories are female, and most of them are illiterate. It is difficult to produce worker representatives. How should this be handled? (4) Does the factory owner or manager have the right to submit resolutions of the factory council for reconsideration? If so, how many times is reconsideration limited to? This is Question 15. Chapter 12, Penal Provisions. This law stipulates many matters that both labor and management should fulfill, but only a few items are specified for punishment in this chapter. Does this mean that all the remaining items that should be punished do not need to be enforced? This is Question 16. After the Factory Law and its Implementation Regulations are implemented, should the benefits that workers originally obtained through other contracts, in addition to the benefits they should obtain under this law, continue to exist? This is Question 17.</p>
<p>▲ Annotated Opinions of the Municipal Government: The Shanghai Municipal Government's Review of the Social Affairs Bureau's Request for Interpretation of the Implementation of the Factory Law and its Implementation Regulations. Article 1. (1) According to the provisions of this article, regardless of whether the factory uses steam power, electric power, or hydraulic power for all or part of its machinery, and regardless of the size of the part, this law should apply as long as it regularly employs thirty or more workers. If it is being evasive by dividing the work done by machine-powered parts and the work done by human-powered parts into two separate factories, making the number of workers in the machine-powered part less than thirty in order to avoid the obligations of this law, it should be determined by whether the divided factories are located in the same place. If they are in the same factory, separated into two parts, or separated adjacently, and have the same business name, the number of people should be counted together to determine their qualifications. (2) Although the meaning of the four words "employ workers" is broad, based on the intent of this article, the specified number of thirty is the minimum. It should specifically refer to production workers. Gatekeepers, cooks, and janitors should not be included in the count. (3) This article stipulates that workers are specifically those who are regularly employed. Therefore, contract workers, piece-rate workers, day-rate workers, substitute workers, and temporary mobile workers should not be subject to this law. Article 3, Paragraph 2, "Registration of the month and year of employment of workers." Although the exact month and day of entry into the factory of existing long-term workers may not be verifiable due to the passage of time, the years of work in the factory can be recorded. If, as the Bureau stated, even the years are difficult to accurately calculate, registration will be difficult. However, observing this situation, it must be rare. The worker's period of work in the factory must be at least ten years. The competent authority may make appropriate adjustments, such as considering it as entering the factory on January 1, of a certain year, for the purpose of counting. Article 4, Paragraph 2, Workers' injuries, illnesses, and their treatment shall be reported to the competent authority once every six months. This regulation originally had four items to be reported, all to clarify the equipment and treatment in the factory. Therefore, these injuries and illnesses should refer to those caused by the performance of duties. Article 10, and Article 6 of the Implementation Regulations, According to Article 6 of the Implementation Regulations, the so-called detailed reasons to be reported to the competent authority do not specify the order of procedures, so it can be accommodated by handling it while starting work and reporting at the same time. Article 11, This case stipulates that child laborers work eight hours a day, which is a protective policy. The original intention cannot be changed to take care of the interests of the factory. Article 13, This article aims to maintain morals and focus on the education of workers' children. Judging from the current facts, there is indeed a need for remedies. The central government should be asked to handle this. Article 15, According to the law, leave of absence and holidays are the inherent rights and interests that workers should enjoy. Therefore, the so-called one day of rest in every seven days should include the number of days of leave and holidays. As for the rationale for paying wages as usual on rest days, piece-rate workers should not enjoy this right. Moreover, the wage standard for rest days should be reasonably calculated based on the worker's average monthly wage. Article 17, The Bureau's opinions and handling of this article can be adopted. However, if the worker does have special circumstances, they should still be allowed to designate it themselves to show fairness. Article 18, (1) According to the law, if a worker does not want to take leave, the factory has an obligation to pay additional wages. Similarly, if the factory does not want work to stop, it can force workers to work during the holiday period by suspending wages. Although this is not explicitly stipulated in the law, it is still permissible. (2) According to the laws and regulations, there is no room for changing the payment of wages as usual during the holiday period. Considering the circumstances, the silk weaving industry is on the verge of collapse, and there is a need for accommodation. This should be resolved by a clear order from the central government. (3) According to Article 1 of this law, it specifically refers to regularly employed workers. Day-rate, piece-rate, and temporary workers do not have the right to enjoy the wages paid as usual during the holidays under this article and Article 10. Article 15, Workers who enter the factory to perform important work usually have considerable qualifications. Paying a deposit is merely a difficulty, or there is no risk of losing their jobs or borrowing money at high interest rates due to being bound by this article. Otherwise, the Bureau's proposed accommodation method is with the consent of both parties and is still permissible. Article 32, When a worker violates the provisions of this article and causes losses to the factory, although this law does not explicitly prohibit it, they are liable for compensation. However, to avoid disputes, it is legal to stipulate this in the contract. Article 37, The two opinions originally proposed by the Bureau are indeed reasonable, but they concern laws and regulations and are not suitable for discussion. Article 45, (1) The two words "injury and illness" should be explained together, meaning illness caused by injury during work. It is unreasonable to require medical assistance for all common illnesses. (2) It is true that factories with low capital find it difficult to pay for subsidies and bereavement expenses. However, it is not appropriate to make any proposals regarding whether they can be reduced. (3) Performing duties should refer to engaging in production work. According to the Bureau's example of a delivery worker dying, it concerns a matter of criminal responsibility. The factory may not be responsible, but it is not impossible to give discretionary bereavement out of sentiment. Article 51, The matters listed in the preceding article (Article 50) are all to maintain the interests of both labor and management. Therefore, public procedures are stipulated. The worker representatives first consult with the factory, and if it is not resolved, it will be handled by the factory council to avoid one party being controlled by the disadvantageous支配 of the other party. If it still cannot be resolved, it can be handled according to the Labor Dispute Resolution Law. The legislative intent is quite thorough, and there seems to be no need for much concern. Article 54, The qualifications of factory representatives in the factory council are stipulated in Article 49 of this law, which should select those who are familiar with the factory or the situation of the workers. Therefore, it is not limited to the factory director and manager. If they are selected from among the staff and meet the above qualifications with the consent of the factory, it is permissible. The qualifications of factory representatives, according to the above explanation, are not limited to those within the factory. Therefore, there seems to be no need to reduce the number of representatives. (3) Although most female workers are illiterate, they are not necessarily unreasonable. When difficulties arise regarding elections, writing, or the need for written language, they can ask someone to write on their behalf. (4) Does the factory owner or manager have the right to submit resolutions of the factory council for reconsideration? This law does not have explicit provisions. However, when the factory council cannot be resolved, there is a clear remedy stipulated in Article 51, which is to handle it according to the Labor Dispute Resolution Law. There seems to be no need to submit it for reconsideration. Chapter 10 Penal Provisions. (1) After this law is promulgated and implemented, labor and management each have an obligation to comply with and fulfill. Conversely, they should be punished. This is clear. Therefore, for minor cases, even though this law does not explicitly stipulate punishment, the competent authority will make appropriate adjustments and enforce them to uphold the law. (2) After this law and its Implementation Regulations are implemented, should the benefits that workers originally obtained through other contracts, in addition to the benefits they should obtain under this law, continue to exist? It concerns a matter of civil law debt, which is not obstructive to the implementation of this law and its regulations. It can be set aside. The above regulations are only to add annotations to the law and facts. It concerns the application of laws and regulations, which cannot be decided by a single city. According to the news, the Ministry of Industry believes that there are three points that are most difficult to implement in the Factory Law. (1) The issue of female workers' night work. (2) The issue of paid leave. (3) The issue of factory councils. On the first point, the Central Political Council has decided to postpone the implementation for two years as preparation. On the second point, the Central Political Council's First 115th Standing Committee's resolution that workers' paid leave should be based on the collective agreement work contract case is in conflict, and the Ministry of Industry has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, which has been sent to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. On the third point, the qualifications of factory representatives are limited to the factory director and manager according to the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce's interpretation, which differs from the Ministry of Industry's interpretation according to Article 6 of the Labor Union Implementation Law, and the Executive Yuan has sent a request to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. This is stated together.</p>
<p>▲ Opinions of the Ministry of Industry's Review: Ministry of Industry's Review of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Request for Interpretation of the Factory Law and its Implementation Regulations. Article 1. (1) The original annotated opinions (referring to the Shanghai Municipal Government's review opinions) are still feasible. (2) Should doormen, cooks, janitors, etc., be subject to this law? This has already been presented to the Executive Yuan for forwarding to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation in the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's transfer of the China Chemical Industry Society's request for interpretation of the ambiguities in the Factory Law. (3) Should contract workers, piece-rate workers, monthly workers, substitute workers, and temporary mobile workers be subject to this law? This point is more important and should be requested by the Executive Yuan to consult the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. Article 3, Section 2. The registration of workers' month and year of entry into the factory is for the calculation standard of the special leave in Article 17 of this law, and the advance notice period in Article 27, it should not be speculatively estimated to cause disputes. Moreover, each factory must have a register for issuing wages, so it is not impossible to verify from what year and month they started working, even if they have been in the factory for many years. The original annotated method would cause trouble. Article 4, Section 2. The provisions of this section are not only to clarify the equipment and treatment in the factory, but also to pay attention to the health of the workers. Therefore, all injuries and illnesses of the workers should be reported. Article 10 and Article 6 of the Implementation Regulations. The original annotated opinions are still feasible. Article 11, The original annotated opinions are very appropriate. Article 13, Regarding the prohibition of female workers working late at night, it has been decided by the Central Political Council after the China Industrial Federation and others submitted a request to postpone the Factory Law. Two years is the preparatory period for implementation. Article 15 and Article 18, Regarding the interpretation of the calculation of seven days, the original annotated opinions are still appropriate. Regarding whether piece-rate workers should be subject to the provisions of Article 18 for paid leave, the Executive Yuan has consulted the Judicial Yuan for interpretation after the China Industrial Federation and others submitted a request to postpone the Factory Law. Regarding the wage standard for holidays, if it is temporarily calculated as workers who are paid monthly, there will be no wage standard issue. If it refers to piece-rate workers, it should be verified after the Judicial Yuan interprets it. Article 17, The original annotated opinions are still appropriate. Article 18, (1) Working during the holiday period should be limited to the worker's willingness according to the law. (2) Giving special accommodation to the silk weaving industry is not in accordance with the law. Should it be resolved by a clear order from the central government? Still requesting the Executive Yuan to decide. (3) Should piece-rate, day-rate, and temporary workers be subject to this regulation? Judicial interpretation should be awaited. Article 25, Even if the worker agrees to deduct wages in advance as a deposit, it is still illegal. However, it is not against the law for the worker to pay the factory after receiving their wages. Article 32, The original annotated opinions are very appropriate. Article 37, The original opinions presented by the Social Affairs Bureau are very inappropriate. The reason is that women of the capitalist class do not overwork on weekdays, and resting for six weeks before and after childbirth may not be a physiological obstacle. Female workers work with physical strength, and the period of rest after childbirth should be longer. It seems not excessive to stipulate eight weeks. As for the factory discretionally providing subsidies during the holiday period, it is not in accordance with the law. Furthermore, this article stipulates the protection of the mother's health. Whether or not a female worker is pregnant due to marriage should not be investigated. Article 45 (1) The two words "injury and illness" are, in legal terms, actually side by side. However, there are different situations of getting sick due to performing duties. Some people suffer from various diseases during the performance of duties, some suffer from occupational diseases due to performing duties, and some are injured and sick due to performing duties. This article does not clearly define the explanation of the disease, what kind of disease is ultimately referred to, the Executive Yuan should be requested to transfer it to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. (2) The original opinions presented by the Social Affairs Bureau, dividing the subsidy and bereavement standards into grades, are not without considerable reason. However, it concerns changing laws and regulations. Should it be given relief, or should it be postponed for consideration? Still requesting the Executive Yuan to decide. (3) Should deliverymen be subject to the provisions of this article? This point is the same as the question in Article 1, Section 2. Judicial interpretation should be awaited. The original annotated opinions are still acceptable. Article 51, The original annotated opinions are very appropriate. Article 54, The original annotated opinions are very appropriate. Chapter 12, Regarding the penalty, the original annotated opinions are still feasible. Regarding the benefits obtained through other contracts, all those that do not conflict with this law and its implementation regulations may continue to be enjoyed.</p>

<h3>County District Oath-Taking Ceremony Recorded</h3>

<h3>Resolution of Disputes in the Transportation Industry Association</h3>
<p>▲ Limit North and South City Associations to Dissolve ▲ Merge into the City Transportation Industry Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Transportation Industry Association in the northern district of Shanghai and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Transportation Industry Association in the southern city have been in dispute for several months over the merger issue without resolution. According to the central government's laws and regulations on professional groups and establishing associations, the same industry in one place may not establish separate associations, except for branches. However, in the past, the transportation industry had already established associations in the north and south cities due to factual needs, and both associations have a long history. However, since their organizations violate current laws and regulations, they must be reorganized in addition to merging. The city authorities previously ordered the merger, and after many twists and turns, it was decided to reorganize and establish a city transportation association in the central urban area, with a branch in each of the north and south cities. However, the two associations still had disputes over the name, which prevented a quick decision. To prevent disputes, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has now instructed the Southern City Association to dissolve within days and merge into the City Transportation Industry Association, and has also sent a letter to the Municipal Party Headquarters to transfer the Civil Training Section to send personnel to guide the merger. The merger issue of the two associations has now come to an end.</p>
<h3>Various Rice Boats Oppose Quarantine Fees</h3>
<p>▲ Rice and Grain Association Petitions for Exemption</p>
<p>The various rice boats anchored in the Wusong River in the urban area were forced to collect annual quarantine fees by the Shanghai Port Quarantine Station on the 10th of this month, causing opposition from the rice boats. Li Sontang, a patrol officer from the Zhabei Water Patrol Team, took the initiative to mediate and negotiated a postponement for consultation, which prevented a conflict from occurring. The rice boats then jointly appealed to the Shanghai Rice and Grain Industry Association for assistance and expressed their reasons and serious concerns. The association yesterday submitted a special report to the Social Affairs Bureau stating that the report was submitted as a factual report of the obstruction to the source of the city's food supply by the port's boat double disinfection rules and to look forward to receiving the maintenance and nuclear transfer exemption, in order to eliminate hidden worries. The case was based on the Bureau's order No. 16471, forwarding a copy of the Port Quarantine Regulations and the Port Boat Double Disinfection Rules, etc. In response to this, on the 10th of this month, the Port Quarantine Station sent many people to the area under the New Gate Bridge River to forcibly charge rice boats, causing disturbances. Fortunately, the Zhabei Water Patrol Team persuaded them to postpone for one or two days, pending consultation, which prevented a storm from materializing. The association should have acted according to the requests of the rice boat passengers, who all asked the association to make a request, and all believed that the port quarantine regulations and the disinfection fee rules all applied to boats entering and leaving the port. Now, Article 5 of the port's boat double disinfection rules stipulates the fee, which has violated the principle of charging a fee for each quarantine stipulated in Article 21 of the Port Quarantine Disinfection Fumigation and Fee Rules, and the ordinary annual fee is nothing more than a disguised ship donation. According to the National Construction Outline, the central government and local governments have clear regulations. Rice boats are anchored in the Wusong River and are within the scope of municipal administration. Rice boats are a type of cargo transportation and are clean and hygienic, and they are not comparable to other types of ships. What kind of epidemic can be said? Rice boats come from Changxi Chengyi and do not have the facts that Article 7 of the regulations considers should be quarantined. There is no need to request the quarantine and disinfection of the station. Rice boats have already shouldered the city's ship donation and have fulfilled their positive obligations on administrative expenses. Then, even if there is disinfection to prevent epidemics, they should enjoy the right to improve health. In this way, there are multiple political orders and overlapping political expenses. The port quarantine office has invaded the administrative scope of the inner river and is unable to implement quarantine in fact. It is attempting to obtain unearned annual benefits. Outside the policy principles of abolishing exorbitant taxes, it is collecting exorbitant and miscellaneous epidemic fees under the guise of cunning names, increasing the burden on the people, and violating the principle of people's livelihood. It does not know what it is based on, and it openly endangers people's livelihood. Furthermore, the various items in the regulations must be clearly stipulated by the Ministry of Health. Now that the Ministry of Health no longer exists, the basis for the existence of the station has become a problem. Then, which agency and based on what facts designate quarantine and forcibly charge fees for rice boats anchored in the urban area? We rice boats come to Shanghai and work hard through rain and wind, wearing the moon and stars, and use all our blood and sweat to make a living. If the station must force us unreasonably, we can only unanimously strike and disappear from Shanghai. If we ask for more, we will destroy the boat and change careers, and we will not count on it. Please forward it to the competent authorities and give it protection. According to this, the association listened in detail to the various sections described by the rice boat passengers, which have considerable reasons and personal suffering. At this time of disaster throughout the country and food panic among the people, if we impose fees without any factual basis, not to mention the boundaries of administrative powers and the scope of the quarantine area, even in terms of rice tax, we are still exempted by the government, then the epidemic fee is not a national tax, and it should be exempted to slightly enrich the people's livelihood and reduce the suffering, which is a fair reason. Otherwise, forced extortion will inevitably disturb the order of the city and hinder the source of food. For this reason, we are submitting a special report, looking forward to your bureau's protection, transferring it to the municipal government, considering the importance of people's food, the suffering of people's livelihood, and reviewing and transferring it to the competent ministries and courts to exempt rice boats from this exorbitant fee burden, and begging to first inform the Shanghai Port Quarantine Station by letter, and not to force rice boats to pay fees before the competent government authorities issue a clear order, otherwise it should be held fully responsible for any storm caused. The presentation is not too much to look forward to. Respectfully presented to Pan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>All Workers of the French Concession Public Works Bureau Assist Dismissed Workers</h3>

<p>▲ Southern Fujian The Southern Fujian Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Fujian Railway Preparatory Office yesterday, saying that Mr. Huang Yizhu of Gulangyu forwarded it to the Fujian Provincial Railway Preparatory Office. Fujian has overlapping mountains and has always been blocked by traffic. During the late Qing Dynasty, relying on overseas Chinese to invest in the construction of the Zhangxia Railway, it was finally entrusted to the wrong person, with double the cost and half the effort, and the income was not enough to maintain the road. None of the sleepers are complete. If we don't quickly plan to maintain it now, the former intentions will be abandoned. You have the great intention of loving the group and thinking of building roads to revitalize the industry. First build the Songwu Railway, and then gradually extend it to the entire Fujian. All Fujian people should do their best. Even our party and the central government are obliged to do so. We hope to have a detailed plan and actively proceed. In the near future, we can save the hometown, and in the long run, we can save the country. Establishing virtue and meritorious service will be immortal, which is by no means comparable to ordinary enterprises. Signed, Southern Fujian Association in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Kidnappers Tear Tickets to a Tragic End</h3>
<p>▲ The deceased was Hu Fufang ▲ The limbs were cut into three sections</p>
<p>At around 7:00 PM last night, a car was driving near Xiaoshadu Road, Nanyang Road. Suddenly, a huge cloth bag was thrown from the car onto the ground, and then the car sped away without a trace. At this time, a woman passing by walked over to take a look and couldn't help but cry out in horror. The cloth bag contained a male corpse with chopped limbs. This caused a stir and many onlookers gathered. The incident was reported to the Jing'an Temple Road police station, and detectives were immediately dispatched to investigate. They saw that the body had been cut into three sections and wrapped in bundles with thin cloth. The situation was extremely tragic. The body was taken to the police station, and out of fear that the kidnappers had torn up the tickets, those involved were summoned to identify the body. It was confirmed that the victim was Hu Fufang, a local resident who had been kidnapped on the 17th of last month. The deceased was 34 years old and lived in a bungalow at 821 Hu's Residence, Weihaiwei Road. At around 9:45 AM on the 17th of last month, he was supervising the construction of a new house at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Tongfu Road when he was abducted into a car by five bandits. The car number was 1876, which was later found to be a forgery.</p>
<h3>Recommendations on the Issue of Increased Pilotage Fees</h3>
<p>Dalu Bao reported that the members of the Shanghai Pilots' Association went on strike for a week in the summer due to the issue of increased fees. Subsequently, the officials in charge of pilotage dispatched a secretary from the Audit Department of the Customs to consider their demands. It is now heard that the secretary has submitted a recommendation that 40% of the pilotage fee be calculated in gold coins and 60% be calculated in Mexican dollars. It is also proposed to restrict merchant ships over 450 feet in length to employing pilots within the Wusongkou to ensure the safety of navigation. It is expected that whether or not this recommendation will be adopted will be decided by the pilotage officials within three weeks.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Refugee Shelters</h3>
<p>The city's shelter for disaster victims was originally a temporary relief effort and was intended to last for three months. It began in September and has been running for over two months. It was scheduled to end completely this month. Unexpectedly, refugee shelters in various places have closed down one after another, and people are flocking to Shanghai to escape the famine. At that time, the First Shelter already had more than 6,000 people and could no longer accommodate more. Moreover, there are always famine refugees every year, and this year will inevitably increase. Furthermore, the quality of people among them varies. Sheltering everyone would be an endless task and also cause concerns about public security. Therefore, following the established practice, rations were issued and they were sent back to their hometowns. Before being sent back, they had nowhere to stay, so they were temporarily allowed to rest and sleep in the unfinished Second Shelter's sheds (this shelter was originally planned not to be used, so there were no bed boards). Food and drink were provided. Compared to the situation of disaster victims in the city's First Shelter, the difference is as great as heaven and earth, but compared to the shelters in the inland, it is still similar. These disaster victims continued to come even after being sent away, resulting in extreme crowding. Most of the Anhui and Hubei disaster victims in the First Shelter have already been sent away. The Jiangbei disaster victims do not want to leave hastily because of the comfortable life in the shelter, and they requested to be accommodated until next spring. The office considered the time too long and had no such arrangement. Moreover, not all who came were disaster victims, and various propagandas were not without ulterior motives. Now, various charities will raise funds to continue operating. The office has also scheduled a meeting at 10:00 AM on the 14th of this month to discuss the handover procedures. Representatives from various charities will also attend. In addition to self-operated efforts, the disaster victims' clothing and bedding have received generous donations from various philanthropists and organizations. However, the number of people is too large, and they are quickly used up. Moreover, they are of varying ages and lengths, making it difficult to distribute evenly. Only those who have personally experienced it can understand this. Many clothes and bedding were initially said to require the donor to be present at the scene for distribution, so the shelter had to wait. Also, if a small amount of clothing is distributed, there is a rush to claim it, and there is not enough to go around. Those who do not understand the situation think, "Why not distribute the clothes and bedding that are available?" Some disaster victims even hide the clothes and bedding they receive and deliberately cry out in the cold, hoping to get more. Some even steal during distribution. There are various situations. Recently, Director Wang raised clothing and bedding to ensure that all disaster victims get what they need.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog at Songkou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Around 1:00 PM yesterday, fog rose over the sea off the coast of Wusongkou. By 3:00 PM, it was very heavy, and the Three Gorges area was a blur. Ships entering and exiting the port temporarily stopped sailing because they could not distinguish the navigation routes. Sailing ships all avoided the Huangpu River bank to avoid danger. The lighthouse also temporarily shone its light to guide the way. The sound of foghorns on the sea was incessant. After 5:00 PM, the fog slightly dissipated, and navigation gradually resumed. It was reported that a small sailboat near the Shihuigengbian of Paotaiwan accidentally ran aground there, but fortunately, the damage was minimal. Soon, it managed to back out, sailed into the Yunzaobang to unload cargo and undergo repairs.</p>

Both defendants, accompanied by lawyers, surrendered to the court. The plaintiff, Wu Boyou, did not appear and his lawyer presented the case. The lawyer stated that Wu Boyou went to 1787 Haining Road on the 21st of last month around 8:00 PM to seek treatment from laryngologist Ma Fengbo because a shop friend was sick. However, at that time, the plaintiff did not know that Ma had passed away, so he knocked on the door and entered. Unexpectedly, the defendants let out vicious dogs that bit fiercely until the plaintiff was bitten on the side. The defendant then ordered the dogs to stop biting. Later, he asked dog doctor Jin Wentao for treatment and reported the injury to the Prosecutor's Office of your court. However, by the 2nd of this month, the plaintiff's injuries had become more severe and his life was in danger. Moreover, because he had no relatives in Shanghai, he was sent back to his hometown. His life is currently uncertain, so he cannot come to court today. He is requesting compensation for medical expenses of 7,700 yuan and other losses of 300 yuan, etc. He then submitted the doctor's injury report. Ma Wenyao testified that he was not at home that day, so he knew nothing about what happened. Ma Bosun testified that he was 20 years old and worked in laryngology. Wenyao is my paternal uncle. This dog was raised by my friend Mr. Li on the 18th of last month. On the night of the 21st, when the plaintiff came to seek medical treatment, because the front door was ajar and the plaintiff did not knock on the door, he pushed the door open and entered. At that time, I was having dinner upstairs and the dog was eating in the guard room downstairs, so the muzzle happened to be off, which led to the incident. When I heard the alarm and rushed down, I helped the plaintiff up and saw a dog bite mark on his knee and blood flowing from his ear. I immediately applied medicine for him and gave him two yuan for losses and four corners for transportation, and hired a car to take him away. Therefore, not only was I not at the scene at the time, but I also did not clap and laugh on the side. Finally, the lawyers for both parties debated for a long time. Judge Shen announced the end of the debate in this case and scheduled the judgment for next week. Ma Bosun posted 50 yuan in cash as bail.</p>
<h3>Dancer Sues Fake Mother Case Settled</h3>
<p>▲ Severing Ties With Each Other</p>
<p>Shi Lulan (also known as Zhang Lulan, 22 years old), a Ningbo woman who used to work as a dancer in the Da Hu Dance Hall and the Xin Xin Dance Hall, recently hired lawyer Fan Gang to sue Zhang Wang, a Ningbo woman residing at 212 Huaide Lane, Baker Road, in the First Special District Court for harming public morals and infringing on freedom. The gist of her complaint was that the plaintiff lost her father at the age of twelve and, because she was related to the defendant, was fostered by her. At the age of seventeen, the defendant forced her into prostitution. At that time, because she was young and timid, she did not dare to disobey. The defendant accepted gold lockets worth hundreds of yuan given by patrons, beaming with satisfaction, disregarding the plaintiff's loss of virtue and humiliation. She also did not promise the plaintiff to marry the patron, which could have saved her reputation and covered up her lifelong shame. From then on, she was tainted and lived in regret day and night. After the age of nineteen, the plaintiff's knowledge gradually increased and she no longer wanted to engage in prostitution. When she reasoned with the defendant, the defendant changed her approach and ordered the plaintiff to work as a dancer in a dance hall, and the defendant took all the money. Later, although it was agreed to split the money in half, the plaintiff was still being cheated, and the plaintiff did not receive a single cent. Moreover, the plaintiff still had to pay half of the household's daily expenses for food, clothing, and housing. Therefore, the plaintiff owed the dance hall about 300 yuan. According to the accounts, the plaintiff had more than 400 yuan deposited with the defendant. Even if she was sick, she was not allowed to rest and was still forced to go to the dance hall and was repeatedly abused. It is painful to talk about. The defendant has committed crimes under Articles 241, 246, and 315 of the Criminal Law. The plaintiff requests that she be arrested and interrogated and punished accordingly, and that a civil lawsuit be attached to recover the embezzled money of more than 400 yuan, and that the two parties be allowed to sever ties, and that the defendant not be allowed to infringe on the plaintiff's body, which would be a great benefit. The court granted the request and issued a subpoena, scheduling a hearing. It is now known that the case has been mediated and settled. The condition is that a paper stating the severance of ties be signed. From now on, Shi Lulan will sever all ties with Zhang Wang and regain her personal freedom. Thereafter, Zhang Wang shall not infringe on Shi in any way. As for Shi's lawsuit, Lawyer Fan has also submitted a statement to the Special Court to withdraw the complaint, and the case has been concluded.</p>
<h3>Two Prostitutes Flee Shanghai From Beijing</h3>
<p>▲ Escaping the Brothel</p>
<p>Wang Hubaozi, an 18-year-old woman from Taizhou, lived and worked at 533 Tongxing Workshop. Unexpectedly, she was lured away by someone a few days ago and sold to a brothel in Xiaguan, the capital, to become a prostitute. Because she could not endure the suffering of welcoming new guests and seeing off old ones, she was often beaten by the procuress. At that time, there was also a prostitute named Lu Yuezhen, 23 years old, from Wenzhou, who had come to the brothel after having a romantic life in Shanghai and being pawned by her husband's family. However, she had become knowledgeable, and outwardly received guests while secretly planning to escape. Seeing Wang Hubaozi's pitiful state, she confided in her and made her an ally. The day before yesterday, they secretly left the brothel together and took the Shanghai-Beijing train to Shanghai. However, after arriving at the Shanghai train station, because their actions were flustered, they aroused suspicion everywhere and were questioned by the police. They stammered and were taken to the police station together. Yesterday, they were transferred to the District Court for interrogation. After a preliminary hearing by the prosecutor, they were ordered to be sent to the hall for care and custody, and to wait for family members to come and take them back for supervision.</p>
<h3>Dispute Between Soldier and Old Woman Over Lottery</h3>
<p>Around 3:00 PM yesterday, there was a quarrel between an old woman and two soldiers at Lu Jia Bang Chi He Tou in Nanshi. Gao Junkui, a guard police officer from the 25th post there, heard about it and rushed to take all the people involved to the First Section, First Precinct police station. During the preliminary hearing by the chief of the station, the old woman testified that she was Wang Zhou, 59 years old, from Tongzhou, and currently lived in Chi He Tou. She said, "Today I was sitting in the parlor when I suddenly saw these two soldiers barging in through the back door. They told me that I was playing the lottery and that they were here to investigate. I replied that I never play the lottery. They then undressed me and searched me, but found nothing. At that time, one of the soldiers took a piece of paper he was holding and secretly placed it in a child's hat placed on the table in my house. After a while, he picked up the hat and suddenly said that the evidence had been found, so why deny it? I argued with them strongly. The soldier then shouted and slapped me in the face several times. I was dissatisfied with this, which led to the quarrel. The two soldiers were actually fabricating evidence to frame me, and their extortion failed. They even dared to rely on their strength and act barbarously. I hope you will investigate thoroughly." One of the soldiers testified that his name was Li Guifa, 28 years old, from Hangzhou, and he was currently a corporal serving as a messenger in the Military Law Tribunal of the Songhu Garrison Command. He said, "Today, my friend Yu Baoqiu and I went out for a stroll. When we passed by Chi He Tou, we saw a child saying that Wang Zhou's family was playing the lottery. The two of us went inside to take a look. After a while, we found a lottery ticket on her table," etc. Yu Caoqiu testified that he was 32 years old and currently worked as a clerk in the Ordnance Department of the Songhu Garrison Command. The rest of his testimony was the same as Li's. Because the testimonies of both sides were contradictory, they were ordered to prepare a document and submit it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Tragic Incident Caused by Hitting High Lanterns</h3>
<p>▲Destroying Lanterns and Injuring Children▲ The Parties Reached a Settlement</p>
<p>Yao Fengxiang, a villager from Songyi Yaojiazhai, Xishou Meilong Town, Huxi, was celebrating his son Jinsheng's wedding the day before yesterday (the 11th). Friends and relatives were present, and guests filled the house. Around 5:00 PM, before the bridal sedan chair returned from the bride's home, a group of people leading the way with high lanterns and musical instruments made the scene extremely lively. Unexpectedly, when they reached Jinjiawan, more than a dozen mischievous children, each holding a bamboo pole, suddenly rushed forward, snatched the lanterns and destroyed them. A pair of high lanterns were also broken by the bamboo poles (this custom of "hitting high lanterns" is common in the western countryside of this city, but it is mostly done by children). Zhang Gensheng, who was carrying the high lanterns, was very angry to see the children so reckless and unreasonable, so he temporarily used the wooden lantern poles as clubs and beat the children wildly, causing injuries to seven people, including Chen Atu. Chen Atu, 14 years old, suffered a bleeding head wound and bruises all over his body, and was seriously injured. Chen Gendi, 16 years old, had a tooth knocked out, and blood flowed from his mouth and nose. Jin Baokang, 15 years old, had bruises on his face. Jin Baosheng, 13 years old, had a sprained and swollen leg. Jin Awun, 16 years old, was hit in the waist. Chen Maomao, 14 years old, injured his arm. Chen Guizhen (female), 13 years old, injured her right hand and foot. All of the above were club injuries. It is believed that none of them are life-threatening, but there was a chorus of crying, which was extremely tragic. Later, after the family members heard the news and rushed to the scene, they first carried the injured children home for self-treatment. At the same time, they grabbed Zhang Gensheng, the perpetrator, and beat him violently, and sent people to guard the bridal sedan chair, the musical troupe, and the wedding guests, not allowing them to leave. The situation was fierce. Later, people separately reported to both the groom's and bride's families. The parties involved, Yao Fengxiang and Shen Quanlin, learned of the incident and went to mediate, willing to bear the medical expenses, etc. After repeated consultations, the matter was finally resolved around 3:00 AM yesterday. The bride sat in the sedan chair for ten hours. By the time the wedding ceremony was completed, the east was already bright.</p>

<h3>Robbery at Feixing Company</h3>
<p>▲ Two Guests Visiting Friends Robbed Unjustly</p>
<p>Around 7:00 PM last night, two robbers suddenly came to the Shenzhuang of the Feixing Company at the Yangxing Street entrance of Caishinong, French Concession. They were wearing overcoats and copper basin hats. They went upstairs to the second floor and rushed into the accounting room. Mr. Peng, the company's accountant, was settling accounts. When he saw them, he asked the tea servant to inquire. Unexpectedly, the two robbers took out guns from their overcoat pockets and threatened to stop shouting. The tea servant believed that the two were holding guns to rob, so he rushed out of the accounting room and went downstairs to report the arrest. He was chased by a robber, driven back into the accounting room and watched. One robber searched and robbed more than 200 yuan in foreign money from the account table and the foreign box. When the robbers carried the money out of the accounting room door, a man and a woman happened to be dressed gorgeously and went to the Chunji shop on the third floor to visit friends. The robbers stopped them and searched them, and robbed the man and woman of about 100 yuan in silver. The two robbers went downstairs, went out the door and fled west towards the Huajie of the Republic of China Road. The tea servant saw the robbers leave the door and blew the whistle.

<h3>Reader Correspondence</h3>
<p>Regarding Mr. Songquan's suggestion to use silk and satin to make Western suits as a means of resisting Japan and saving the nation, the most effective method is to boycott Japanese goods. However, if we boycott Japanese goods and switch to Western goods, it would be like driving the tiger away from the front door only to let the wolf in through the back; money would still be flowing out, and saving the nation would still be incomplete. Therefore, promoting domestic goods is the only permanent solution. I have observed that, among imported goods, clothing accounts for a significant outflow of funds, and the most distressing aspect is the Western suits worn by the intellectual class. The intellectual class should set an example for the entire nation, yet they sit idly by while a huge amount of money is leaked due to the convenience of Western suits, without considering how to reverse this trend. It is truly regrettable and shameful to be nothing more than salespeople for imported goods. The only solution is to vigorously adopt domestic goods. However, if there are no equivalent domestic products available at the moment, how can we bear to watch the continuous outflow of funds without trying to remedy the situation? Although the Sanyou Industrial Society has "212" wool fabric, I have personally investigated and found that it may not meet the preferences of the general public, as it is too plain and lacks elegance. I then thought that silk and satin have always been the main materials for our national clothing. Now that Western suits have become a global fashion, why can't the Chinese people make them from Chinese silk and satin? After much contemplation, I remain puzzled as to why no one has advocated for this. I request that the reasons be explained and that efforts be made to promote it. If someone takes the lead, it will become a national trend, and domestic silk and satin will become fashionable materials for Western suits.</p>
<p>(Answer) Making Western suits from silk and satin is not entirely impossible. However, those who wear Western suits consider a smooth, neat, and upright appearance to be the standard of beauty. If silk and satin are too soft and prone to wrinkles, they may not be welcomed by the general public. Silk and satin manufacturers should select harder types of silk and satin to make Western suits, invite respected individuals to promote their use, and hold public exhibitions for evaluation. If there are any shortcomings, gradual improvements should be made, and prices should be reduced to facilitate promotion. If government officials could take the lead in wearing them, promotion would be even easier.</p>

<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>To the editor,</p>
<p>Upon reading a news item in today's edition of your newspaper, in the "Domestic Important Telegrams" section, regarding a coal train overturning on the Jia Liu Railway, it was stated that the accident was due to a faulty switch. This does not correspond with the facts. An investigation shows that on the morning of the eighth of this month, our company's Jia Liu coal-transporting light railway, traveling from Jiajiawang to Liuquan, arrived at the fork of wells number four and five. At that time, the locomotive, one baggage car, and two coal cars had already entered the switch when suddenly two local villagers alongside the track recklessly tampered with the track switch, causing the rear coal cars to enter the diverging track and overturn four cars, thus causing the accident. The cause of the accident was entirely due to the local villagers recklessly tampering with the track switch and not a faulty switch. We are writing to request that your newspaper publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section to provide a more accurate account of the incident. We would be deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Huadong Coal Mining Company, November 12.</p>
<p>A public appeal to all circles from the Shanghai Shenbao: At this critical juncture when the nation is facing imminent disaster, the only way to save the precarious situation is for all leaders within the Party to unite sincerely. Therefore, the entire nation unanimously hopes for peace and its swift realization. As a member of the Party, Hua Min and others are particularly concerned. However, the joint telegram from party members in various counties of Jiangsu Province on the fourth of this month was not agreed to by me beforehand. Fearing that misunderstandings may arise, I hereby issue this telegram to clarify the matter.</p>
<p>Sun Zhongyi, grandson of Shen Jizhi, a party member from Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province.</p>

<h3>Recollections from the Tortoiseshell Ridge</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>Li Hongzhang's Revenge After Three Years</p>
<p>During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, disturbances arose in Korea. Xiangcheng (Yuan Shikai) was dispatched as an envoy to that country. Due to the urgency of the situation, he quickly returned. Li Hongzhang supervised Zhili and controlled the military and political affairs of the Beiyang. Knowing that the navy lacked real strength, he dared not rashly initiate military action. The entire court was in turmoil, unable to decide on peace or war. At that time, the officers stationed in Pyongyang, Korea, were Ye Zhichao, Nie Shicheng, Zuo Baogui, and Wei Rugui, with fewer than 10,000 soldiers and no reinforcements. The Japanese government ordered General Ōtori Keisuke to lead over 30,000 infantry and cavalry to press on Pyongyang. Wei Rugui, who was defending the north gate, fled first. Ye Zhichao, as the commander of all forces, firmly refused to engage the enemy. Only when the Japanese soldiers attacked the city did he retaliate. The soldiers lacked morale and were defeated in a single battle. Nie heard the alarm and retreated while fighting. Zuo Baogui, who was defending the west gate, led over 1,300 men to supervise the battle and died in action. Li heard the alarm, threw down his pen, and urgently telegraphed the navy for assistance. Naval Admiral Ding Ruchang's entire fleet was annihilated. The entire court was shocked. Grand Secretary Weng Tonghe strongly recommended that Wu Dachang lead 50 battalions of the Green Standard Army to block the enemy, but they were defeated without even fighting. Only Song Qing's army was still resisting the enemy. The court ordered Li to be a special envoy and to quickly proceed to Maguan to negotiate peace. Japanese Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi made numerous demands, but Li remained unmoved. The Japanese secretly instructed ruffians to shoot Li in the cheek, and the peace talks were delayed. Li lay in the hospital, with his son Boxing attending to him. Boxing quietly shed tears. Li angrily said, "Why do you show weakness to others? I bear a heavy responsibility. Even if I were to be smashed to pieces, it would not be regrettable. The Japanese are trying to force me to submit. How can I be afraid of a single bullet?" He ultimately did not yield. By the time the peace treaty was concluded, public opinion blamed him. In reality, it was not Li's fault. I am afraid that no one else could have achieved such results. The following year, the Russian Tsar's coronation ceremony took place. All countries sent relatives, nobles, and meritorious officials to offer congratulations. Li requested permission to go to Russia to serve. The Empress Dowager Cixi, pitying his old age, comforted him with a warm edict. Li tearfully pleaded, "I have received the favor of the two palaces but have not repaid even a small fraction. I wish to go in person to vent my old resentment and embarrass the Japanese." The Empress was moved by his words and ordered Li's son, Zhongpeng, to be his deputy. They rushed off day and night. He gained the favor of the Russian Tsar, who bestowed upon him exceptionally generous gifts. Not long after, Russia and Japan broke ties, and war raged for several years. Li smiled and said to his staff, "The revenge for the bullet has finally been taken today."</p>
<h3>Zhang Qingtong's Prediction Regarding Japan</h3>
<p>— Yun Jian Pin Xia</p>
<p>Zhang Qingtong, styled Fenghui, was a native of Shanghai. He was a top student at the former Jiangyin Nanjing Academy. He passed the entrance examination for the Tongwen Guan (Interpreter's College) and specialized in Russian for six years. He was talented and had a thorough understanding of world affairs. When Yang Ru was envoy to Russia, he was dispatched to Russia with the approval of the Zongli Yamen (Foreign Affairs Office) as a student at the embassy. He provided much assistance in various negotiations. He often associated with Martens, a famous professor of international law, and Tolstoy, a great writer. After returning to China, he was repeatedly recommended to the position of Daotai (Circuit Intendant). At the beginning of the Republic of China, he served as the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs in Heilongjiang, the Deputy Military Governor of Qaktu, and the Chief Administrator of Altai. He was disliked by Yang Zengxin, the Military Governor of Xinjiang, and was eventually dismissed from office. While he was in Russia, the Russo-Japanese War was taking place. Later, he went to England for business. Through the introduction of Samarhua, a military attaché at the Russian embassy in England, he met Count Benckendorff, the Russian ambassador to England. Benckendorff had long admired Zhang. As soon as he saw Zhang, he invited him to sit down. After a few polite exchanges, he asked a question, which was very concise. Someone without a clear plan or a global perspective would not be able to answer it on the spur of the moment. The conversation between Benckendorff and Zhang is recounted below.</p>
<p>Benckendorff asked, "How will the Japanese treat China in the future?" Zhang replied, "The Japanese treatment of China can be divided into two main factions: one advocates preserving China, and the other advocates preserving Asia." (This statement implicitly suggests Japan's intention to annex China. Zhang's statement is subtle and appropriate.) "Those who want to preserve China hope that China will implement reforms, with Japan assisting from the side, recovering lost rights, and achieving self-reliance. The faction that advocates preserving Asia believes that China is falling into the sphere of influence of the white race, and Japan, being of the same race, cannot sit idly by and watch the white race succeed, just as America protects Americans. Therefore, Japan's desire to expand its influence in China will be more intense and its strategies will be more cunning than those of other countries. The former faction is motivated by morality and has few adherents, while the latter faction is motivated by utilitarianism and has many adherents. We can see this from their handling of Korea. However, the situation in China is more complex, and this faction is still hesitating on how to proceed. We must wait and see what impact the Russo-Japanese War will have on China. If China makes rapid progress, then they may switch to the first faction in the future."</p>
<p>Benckendorff also asked, "How will the Chinese treat Japan?" Zhang replied, "People say that after the Russo-Japanese War, the Chinese government will obey Japan in everything. This statement is very superficial. The government has learned a lesson from Korea and is deeply wary. Moreover, Japan's blatant handling of Korean affairs, completely disregarding other countries, especially China, shows that they see China as unable to escape Japan's control. This is even more painful for the enlightened people in China. I believe that there will be changes in Sino-Japanese relations. We can already see this from the growing dissatisfaction expressed by Chinese students in Tokyo and Chinese newspapers. Furthermore, now that Japan has succeeded, its true face towards China will gradually be revealed. In short, the Chinese may treat Japan with even greater fear and resentment than they did Russia before the Russo-Japanese War. Some say that Japan's harsh measures in handling Korean affairs are meant to alert our government. This is Japan's good intention. I sincerely hope that this statement is true."</p>
<p>Benckendorff further asked, "Why did the Chinese mostly side with Japan during the Russo-Japanese War?" Zhang replied, "As the Russian proverb says, 'You reap what you sow.' Before the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese treated China with apparent sincerity and deep affection, and this was consistent from top to bottom. Their success was especially due to the newspapers. In reality, Japan wanted to avenge Russia's obstruction of the Liaodong Peninsula and had to first win over China. But your country relies entirely on military force to deal with China, not knowing that there are other strategies besides guns and cannons. Is it any wonder that the Chinese mostly sided with Japan?"</p>
<h3>Record of the Student Volunteer Army Inspection</h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>The student volunteer armies of various universities and specialized schools in Shanghai were inspected by district. The schools in South Shanghai and East Shanghai were designated as the Fourth District. The inspection ceremony was held on the morning of November 11th at 9:00 AM at the City No. 1 Sports Field on Dalin Road in West Shanghai. The billiard room across from the City No. 1 Sports Field office was used as a rest area for the visiting officials. This is a brief account of the event to record the heroic spirit of the students.</p>
<p>Among the officials present were Mayor Zhang Yuejun's representative, the Municipal Party Headquarters representative, Student Volunteer Army Training Director Wang Bailing's representative, and several guests from various circles. On the morning of November 11th, there was a light rain. It did not stop from the beginning of the ceremony until the inspection was completed. The Poor Children's Home military band played music to maintain order, which the volunteer army itself took responsibility for. I was relatively far from the podium, so I could not hear the speeches of the important figures, which I greatly regretted. The entire field was muddy and slippery, and those who were not strong on their feet could hardly take a step. But the male and female volunteer soldiers were full of spirit and had the air of brave warriors. They were not subdued by the rain, which was commendable.</p>
<p>The participating schools included Tongji University, Aurora University, Shanghai College of Law and Politics, Shanghai Art College, Dongya Physical Education College, Tongde Medical College, China Medical College, China Sports College, Liangjiang Physical Education College, and others. Only Liangjiang School carried guns and had more advanced skills during the exercises. Aurora's uniforms were the most beautiful, and their marching was orderly and well-coordinated. The female nurses from the Art College had long hair hanging down, which seemed to be a deviation from the essence of artists. Many of the female volunteers from the College of Law and Politics were short and fat. The formation was close to the left side of the field, where the mud was particularly deep, with many sinking in a foot or so. One female student's leather shoe came loose and became deeply embedded in the mud. The commander happened to shout, "Take a step forward!" at that moment, causing the female student great embarrassment. Those wearing yellow and gray cloth uniforms were soaked, including their inner clothing. The azure sky was also playing a prank.</p>
<p>Then, representatives from various organizations walked around the field, inspecting each division. Whenever the representatives stopped, the corresponding band would play loudly, and the representatives would return the salute repeatedly. In this short amount of time, they displayed great authority. After the inspection was completed, no distinction was made between good and bad, and praise and criticism would only be given after the overall inspection.</p>
<h3>What I Heard from the Japanese Den</h3>
<p>— Qifenglou Zhu</p>
<p>It has been fifty days since the violent Japanese forcibly occupied the Eastern Provinces. Their brutal and reckless actions are like those of the 猰犬 (a mythical beast of destruction). Anyone with blood in their veins cannot help but feel grief and anger. Although the League of Nations ordered them to withdraw their troops by a deadline, they ignored it. Furthermore, they have recently put forward conditions to force our recognition. This is truly an escalation of their evil deeds. Our China is certainly not dead yet, but to allow these ugly creatures to run rampant like this is truly infuriating and saddening. However, the Japanese scheme to seize our Northeast Manchuria and Mongolia is not a matter of a single day. Setting aside other things for the moment, even their most trivial actions can reveal their wild ambition to invade and their dishonest intentions. I once heard that when their elementary school teachers are teaching, they draw bananas, tangerines, and other fruits on the blackboard to show the students, and then ask them, "Do you want to eat bananas? Do you want to eat tangerines?" How would young children know? Of course, they would happily agree. The teacher then loudly says, "Bananas and tangerines are all produced in Guangdong and Fujian in China. When you grow up, you can go there and eat your fill." Alas, the Japanese have already done their best to instill in children the evil intention of invading. Their intentions are truly hateful.</p>
<p>The people are furious at the tyranny of the violent Japanese and advocate for boycotting Japanese goods to save the country from danger. This is indeed an invisible weapon, and it has been very effective. Japanese products rely entirely on being sold throughout our country. According to a friend, there are 200,000 people in Japan who work in the marine products industry. The average daily wage for each person is five jiao, so 200,000 people need 100,000 gold every day. Now that our country is boycotting Japanese goods, most of these 200,000 people are said to have lost their jobs. However, this only refers to one industry. The number is already shocking enough. If the people of our country make a determination to permanently reject all food, drink, clothing, and other items, I do not believe that the Japanese cannot be brought to a desperate situation after two or three years. Therefore, a wag has said that China is like a benevolent elder, while Japan is an unfilial child. In the past, Japan relied entirely on the elder's nurturing and support. Now, they forget kindness and repay kindness with ingratitude. Is this the way of a child? Although the words are amusing, there is certainly some truth to them.</p>
<p>▲ Announcement On the evening of the 11th, after the grand gathering at the East Asia Chen Mansion, I mistakenly took a felt hat. Since others are better than me, I dare not take the credit. If any of the guests that day discovered that their hat was taken by mistake, please come to Youlian Film Company at No. 35 Renji Road and describe the brand and markings of the hat. You will surely have the joy of having the original returned.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from the World</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>▲ Triplets of Twins In the town of Hadleigh, Essex, England, there is a chapel where the ladies and gentlemen of the town go to worship every Sunday. In the chapel's choir, there are three pairs of brothers, all twins, who play the organ and sing. Each pair of brothers looks exactly alike. The people who worship consider it a strange sight.</p>
<p>▲ Underwater Photography Near Genoa, Italy, there is a team of oceanographic experts who are conducting research on the seabed. They are able to take photographs at depths of up to 900 feet below the surface, capturing the various plants and animals on the seabed. They are said to have obtained many good materials for museums, which are extremely bizarre and magnificent.</p>
<p>▲ The Custom of Tattooing Sailors and soldiers in the East and West are fond of tattooing flowers on their bodies and arms. In case of an accident at sea, this can serve as a form of identification. This custom of tattooing is particularly prevalent in Egypt and has not declined to this day. Both men and women there are fond of tattooing, either as a charm for love, or to indicate one's social status, or as a talisman to ward off disasters, resolve difficulties, cure diseases, and prolong life.</p>
<h3>A Trifling Talk from the Di Xiang Studio ▲ Wang Zhaoming</h3>
<p>— Gan Liu</p>
<p>In the past, those who talked about revolution invariably mentioned Wang Zhaoming. Today, those who talk about party rule invariably mention Wang Zhaoming. Zhaoming has always lived up to expectations for the country. Zhaoming, styled Jingwei, was a native of Shanyin, Zhejiang. His father, so-and-so, once served as a staff member in Guangdong and settled in Panyu, thus becoming a registered resident there. From a young age, he was intelligent and ambitious, and he loved to read. He could memorize anything he glanced at. Later, he studied in Japan and met Sun Yat-sen in Tokyo. Sun Yat-sen was impressed by his talent and often consulted him in secret about overthrowing the Manchus and restoring the Han. Zhaoming said, "The Qing government has been corrupt for a long time. Now, a three-year-old child is the emperor. What are we waiting for?" Sun Yat-sen approved of this. He then joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) and, together with Zhang Taiyan (Binglin), wrote for the Min Bao (People's Journal), severely criticizing the Qing government's mistakes, often writing thousands of words at a time. In the late Xuan Tong period, he and Huang Fusheng (Shuzhong) secretly entered Beidu (Beijing), rented a house, and posed as merchants, never leaving the house. The two secretly buried landmines to bomb Prince Regent Zaifeng. The matter was exposed, and he was imprisoned in the Ministry of Justice. Tingjie, the Minister of Justice, proposed that he be executed. Prince Su Shanqi, who was in charge of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, insisted that this should not be done, saying that revolutionaries were all over the world and would break out sooner or later. Zhaoming was a scholar and had no ability. It would be better to imprison him for a long time and slowly interrogate him about the secret plans of his party. Even if they could not get all the information, getting half or one or two would be enough for vigilance. Tingjie was moved and agreed. Shanqi told Zaifeng what he had told Tingjie, and Zaifeng also thought so. Zhaoming escaped death. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, he was released from prison. Knowing that Yuan Shikai's old subordinates were all in command of troops and were about to be employed, he invited Yuan's son, Keding, to go to Huan Shang to see Shikai. He rebuked him with righteousness and appealed to public opinion, saying that it was time to expel the young emperor, destroy the Qing court, and establish a democratic republic. Shikai was moved by his sincerity and revealed his hidden feelings. Zhaoming then returned south. After returning, he participated in the North-South peace talks. When the provisional government was established in Nanjing, Zhaoming declared that he would not be an official or a legislator. He was a member of the Six Non-Associations and had Six Non-Regulations. At that time, the people of Guangdong Province were recommending him to be the Governor of Guangdong, and the government was also about to make great use of him. After the Provisional Senate elected Shikai as the Provisional President at Sun Yat-sen's suggestion, Sun Yat-sen immediately sent Zhaoming and Cai Yuanpei and others north to greet him. Shikai was worried about a coup and was reluctant to go south. He secretly instigated a mutiny by the Third Division of his confidant Cao Kun, who burned and looted Beijing and Tianjin, using the excuse that there was no one to sit in the north and that the head of state should delay his trip and that the government should move north. Everyone knows the various events that occurred during that time, so I will not go into detail. When Shikai was elected as the Provisional President, Zhaoming made great efforts. Without this, there would have been a long war between the North and the South, and the abdication of the Qing Emperor would have been indefinitely delayed. The unification could not have been achieved. After Shikai's death, the strength of the Northern Army gradually declined. Year after year, they suffered repeated defeats. Now, they are fundamentally nonexistent. In recent years, Zhaoming entered the Party-State government and then retired due to political disagreements. He likes to write political essays, especially about legal principles. He writes in vernacular style, which he compiles into collections. He also occasionally writes poetry. His poems are sharp and insightful, reflecting his personality.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Novel</p>
<h3>Another Country Bumpkin Arrives in Shanghai (15)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>The ticket seller, not knowing his nephew's name, just kept calling him Ah Mu-lin. Should he persistently ask him where he wanted to go? A passenger said:</p>
<p>"Since he wants to go near Mei Lanfang, isn't Mei Lanfang currently performing at the Great World? Just buy him a ticket to the Third Avenue and let him go to the Great World to find Mei Lanfang himself."</p>
<p>The ticket seller thought: This gentleman's words aren't bad at all. So, he gave him a ticket to get off at the Third Avenue. "Encountering this Ah Mu-lin, only Heaven knows what's across from the Great World." He kept muttering like this as he walked.</p>
<p>"Huh! Across from the Great World, can I still encounter Ah Mu-lin?" The country bumpkin got entangled again. He thought again: Ah Mu-lin said he was in Mei Lanfang Neighborhood, but they say Mei Lanfang is at the Great World. What exactly is going on?</p>
<p>At this moment, the ticket seller hid both hands inside the leather bag he wore, still fumbling with the coins he had earned. He nodded and shook his head, saying with a grin:</p>
<p>"Across from the Great World, there's even a photo of you, old sir." His words made everyone in the car laugh. But the country bumpkin didn't understand what they were laughing at. He thought, "How could there be a photo of me? I've never had my picture taken in my life, not even when I came to Shanghai last time. My son, Ah Da, even urged me to take a photo. I don't know where he heard this wild tale: that a general, born of humble origins, was later imprisoned, and he needed a portrait of his deceased father. The painter asked, 'How should I paint it?' The general said, 'My father never had a photograph.' Later, he picked out a father from a collection of portraits. I said, 'Bah! You must be out of your mind, thinking you'll become a general someday.'" But Ah Da's mother did have a photo taken in the open air at the Yuanmiao Temple in Suzhou. How could there be a photo of me across from the Great World? It's possible there's someone who looks similar. I should go take a look."</p>
<p>Just as he was pondering, he suddenly heard the ticket seller say quietly to the driver:</p>
<p>"Be careful! The 'Ce Lao' are coming."</p>
<p>The country bumpkin understood this sentence. He knew that people in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas call ghosts "Ce Lao." Now they were saying, "The 'Ce Lao' are coming." Didn't that clearly mean: ghosts are coming. But under this clear blue sky, in this bustling and lively area, how could ghosts appear? Yet they said the "Ce Lao" are coming. I should muster my courage and see what kind of "Ce Lao" it is.</p>
<p>Before long, sure enough, a "Ce Lao" with a black face, black skin, black hands, and black feet came up.</p>

<p>The Plunge in Gold Speculation Resumes</p>
<p>▲ A Miserable Fall to 26 Taels</p>
<p>▲ The Situation is Extremely Treacherous</p>
<p>▲ The Silver Association Might Convene</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 12th, gold speculation saw another shocking situation, with the plunge worsening. It broke the 600-tael barrier, and the situation was chaotic and the turmoil dangerous. The entire city saw a difference of 31 taels, leaving traders bewildered and at a loss. The result was a fall of over 26 taels, with vastly different demands from each firm. The fall began in the morning, due to a slight drop in silver prices according to private telegrams, and the rarity of sellers like Citibank. Soon after, remittances tended to weaken, and there were rumors that the International Silver Association might convene, which was enough to stir up excitement. Large investors sold off, causing a sharp drop of over ten taels. There was some fluctuation between two, three, five, and six taels, but the market fell even more sharply later, as news of even more outrageous Japanese atrocities in Heilongjiang Province spread, intensifying the selling frenzy. A gloomy atmosphere pervaded the market, and it eventually broke through the 59-tael mark, creating a dangerous and collapsing situation, before finally leveling off.</p>
<p>▲ Before Noon, Still Above 600 Taels</p>
<p>From the opening, it fell 6 taels and 3 qian, with major reductions of 13/16 for forward contracts and 3/4 for long-term contracts. Public silver prices dropped by 1.875, but private telegrams only dropped by 0.375. Buyers in the market were still strong, with the Dalian gang being the first to enter, followed by Zhipin Yong, Tong Taichang, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, and others, causing a rise of 5 taels, to 17.5 taels. Subsequently, the price fell due to selling positions, but there was some recovery of two or three taels, reaching 14 taels, and then 16.5 taels. The exchange rates for British gold remained the same, while US gold decreased slightly by 0.125. Unexpectedly, news came that the International Bank had another proposal to maintain silver prices, causing the market to weaken. Daxing Yong, Fuchang, Bingxing, Yuanmaoyong, Hengchangyong, and others sold vigorously, with the American banks selling December contracts at 35.875 to 35.9375, causing gold prices to plummet by over 7 taels, to just 608.5 taels. At 9:45, it suddenly rose again by over 5 taels, due to purchases by Zhifeng Yong, Yuanmaoyong, and Yuanxingyong. HSBC also absorbed forward US dollars at 36 yuan, and the Guangdong firms worked hard to close their positions, with HSBC offering 35.9375, so at 10 o'clock it was 14 taels. Later, short-term contracts could be closed at over 36 yuan. Then, Sumitomo offered one-month contracts at 36.3125, and Mackinnon &amp; Mackenzie offered 36.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Yuankangxiang, Hengchangyong, Daxingyong, Hengxing, and others sold heavily, causing prices to plummet by 14-15 taels, with only two or three taels of fluctuation in a short period. At around 11 o'clock, it was only 598.5 taels. Then, HSBC bought up one-month US dollars at 36.625, and general retail shorts came to cover their positions. The Dalian gang continued to buy without stopping, and after 11:30 it went to 600 taels and 0.52 qian. Suddenly, 4-5 taels were lost, so British gold could be closed at 11 1/4 pence, and US dollars at 36.625. Due to the activity of sellers, the noon price was 600 taels and 0.002 qian, reported as a small six anna in Indian currency, i.e. 0.02 taels. By the close, it was 0.01 taels, then it went to 0.02 taels again. The quoted price was 690 taels, a difference of over 70 taels to 90 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Increased Selling Pressure and More Drastic Price Drops</p>
<p>The market opened higher at 0.05 taels, then 0.055 qian, but this was short-lived as Shunli Wanxing sold off, causing an immediate collapse. It was rumored that the situation in Northeast China with the Japanese was again tense.</p>
<p>Firms such as Jiayu, Yuanheng, Zhifeng Yong, Daxing Yong, Fuyu, Tong Taichang, and Fuchang all sold off, while British gold was particularly strong. Shanghai offered one-month contracts at 11 5/16 pence, and Zhejiang bought US dollars at 37.25 yuan. Soon after, short-term contracts also reached 25. The market situation declined drastically, with a massive drop of 15-16 taels, and after 2:30 it was only 59 taels. Later, it rose to 94.5 taels, as Zhifeng Yong and Yuanmaoyong came out to recover their positions, and Dadecheng also bought. However, from 2:45 to 3:30, there were fluctuations of over 3 taels. The Indian exchange rate was reported as a large six anna. Subsequently, as Hengyu, Hengchangyong, Tianfeng Yong, Dadecheng, Shunli, and others all sold off, British gold reached 11 5/8 pence, and US dollars could be closed at 37.125 yuan, causing gold prices to plummet again, with a sudden drop to 86.5 taels at 3:45. Afterward, there were slight fluctuations, but it remained above 90 taels. Buying and selling in the market was complex. After 4:02, it was pulled up to 94 taels. By the 4:30 close, it was 92.8 qian, a sharp drop of 26 taels compared to the previous day. Subsequently, it was suppressed to around 91 taels. The highest price in the entire city was 617.5 taels, and the lowest was 586.5 taels, a difference of 31 taels, which was enormous. The opening price for goods in the morning was 12 taels, the noon close was 0.015 taels, and the afternoon was 0.045 taels. The closing price was 591 taels, a quoted difference of around 100 taels.</p>
<p>The lending rate was 0.01 taels for disaster relief and water supply, 93 taels in the afternoon, and red ink added by Jiuxing.</p>
<p>▲ Differing Demands on the Trading Floor</p>
<p>According to statistics, Zhifeng Yong, Qianchangxiang, Shunli, Wanxing, Tong Taichang, Yifeng, Yifeng Yong, Yuanmaoyong, and Yuanyu Yong all bought, while Yuantai, Hengchangyong, Senchangyong, and Yuhe had mixed activity. Fuchang, Hengyu, Bingxing, Hengxing, Daxing Yong, Futaiheng, Yuankangxiang, and Huachang Yong all sold. In the afternoon, Yuanda Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Yifeng, Yifeng Yong, Shunli, Wanxing, and Huixiang all bought. Yuanmaoyong and Yuanheng sold and then bought. Fuchang, Yuanlianxiang, Hengchangyong, Fuyu, Yuanxingyong, Cuichangyong, Tong Taichang, Daxing Yong, and Hengyu all sold. The Dalian gang bought over 4,000 bales and sold over 1,000 bales, while the Guangdong gang bought over 1,000 bales and sold 400 bales.</p>
<h3>The Decline of Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both the British and American silver markets fell back, but the market situation was stable. British and American exchange rates both fell, so the Shanghai British exchange rate tended to be very strong. HSBC quoted British gold as before, but reduced US dollars by 0.125, to 34.75 yuan. The franc decreased slightly by 7 yuan, and the Japanese yen increased by half a shield, while the rest remained unchanged. The domestic market opened weak and became even weaker later, as the gold market broke through the 600-tael mark, and there were rumors of another proposal for a silver association abroad, coupled with telegrams reporting increasingly outrageous Japanese atrocities in Heilongjiang Province. People were terrified, so the exchange market became even more exhausted. Due to the pressure of the environment, the British gold rate increased by 1 penny and the US dollar rate by 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. Most Chinese merchants sold off, while Guangdong's Shengtada and others bought. Only tens of thousands of pounds of British gold were traded, with aggressive buying and incoming telegrams of sales. There were also transactions of about one million US dollars, and banks like HSBC did not slacken in their buying intentions.</p>
<p>▲ The British Exchange Rate had a Difference of 875 All Day</p>
<p>The tightest was 1 shilling and 10 7/8 pence, and the loosest was 11 5/8 pence. The opening price in the morning was 10 7/8 pence, and the buying price was 8 1/8 pence. Mitsui and Chosen did 12-month contracts at 10 7/8 pence. At noon, Mackinnon &amp; Mackenzie did a three-month contract with Holland at 11 1/4 pence. The noon close was offered at 11 1/4 pence, and bought at 11 5/16 pence. In the afternoon, Shanghai offered one-month contracts at 11 5/16 pence, and the closing prices were 11 5/8 to 11 9/16 pence offered, and 11 11/16 to 11 5/8 pence bid. Trading was quiet.</p>
<p>▲ The American Exchange Rate had a difference of 1.25 yuan</p>
<p>The tightest price was 35.875 yuan, and the hottest price was 37.1875 yuan. The opening price was 36 yuan, and the buying price was 1.25. Sino-Belgian did February contracts at 35.9375 yuan and March contracts at 36 yuan. Shanghai offered 12-month and 1-month contracts at 35.875 to 35.9375 yuan. HSBC bought three-month contracts at 36 yuan, and offered 35.9375 yuan (Shengtada). Mackinnon &amp; Mackenzie bought one-month contracts at 36 yuan, and Zhejiang Mackinnon &amp; Mackenzie offered 35.9375 yuan. Sumitomo offered December contracts at 36 yuan and one-month contracts at 36.3125. The Zhengjin Mackinnon &amp; Mackenzie traded at 5625. Mackinnon &amp; Mackenzie offered one-month contracts at 36.5 yuan (Shengtada). Zhengjin Mackinnon &amp; Mackenzie traded one-month contracts at 625. Zhengjin Taiwan sold to HSBC December contracts at 625. The noon close was offered at 625, and the purchase price was 75. In the afternoon, Zhejiang bought March contracts at 37.25 yuan, and Shanghai bought January contracts at 125. HSBC bought 1875, and Sino-Belgian bought spot contracts at 25. Andatsu offered three-month contracts at 125, and Mackinnon &amp; Mackenzie bought one-month contracts at 3125 and February contracts at 25. Hua Yi bought February contracts at 25. The closing prices were 37.0625 to 37.1875 yuan offered, and 37.1875 to 37.3125 yuan bid. The listed US dollar was one yuan, equivalent to 2 taels, 8 qian, 7 fen, and 769 li.</p>
<h3>British and American Silver Prices Fall Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday, telegrams from London stated that the sharp decline in silver prices was rebounding strongly. Short-term contracts recovered slightly by 0.8125, to 20 3/4 pence, and long-term contracts also shrank by 0.75, to 20 5/8 pence. Chinese firms sold out, and speculators bought in at low prices. The market situation was stable, and the market was uncertain after the close. There was little activity in the United States. Telegrams from New York stated that the price of American silver also fell back by 1.875, with spot prices at 35.375 cents. The exchange rate between British and American currency decreased slightly by 2.5 cents, to 3.795 yuan, and the exchange rate between American and British currency also decreased slightly by 2 cents, to 3.7875 yuan. The London-Shanghai exchange rate decreased by 75, to 1 shilling and 11 1/4 pence. The spot price in Mumbai decreased by 10 anna, to 65 rupees and 2 anna.</p>
<h3>The Drastic Decline in Foreign Fractional Currency</h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview</p>
<p>Since the news of tight silver in Shanghai spread to other ports, everyone who owed money to Shanghai was scrambling for cash to transport it there. As a result, a large amount of cash gathered in various ports, which put downward pressure on the market price of Shanghai fractional currency. Recently, this has become even more intense, and yesterday it plummeted by over one cent. In a matter of days, it has fallen by several cents. As for the silver market situation, it remains tight and has not been able to stabilize quickly. Auxiliary coins are mostly flat and sluggish, not worth recording.</p>
<p>▲ Prices of Fractional Currency Exchange</p>
<p>The "foreign fractional currency" price in the morning fell sharply by half a cent due to soft market sentiment and strong selling pressure, to 7 qian, 2 fen, and 4.5 li. In the afternoon, it suddenly fell another one cent, to 7 qian, 2 fen, and 3.5 li. The total decline between the two sessions was one and a half cents. The "silver fractional currency" price was 3 qian and 5 fen for both the morning and afternoon sessions. The discount rate was 3 qian and 34 li. The bank posted a rate of 1 qian and 4 fen.</p>
<p>▲ Auxiliary Coin Market Conditions</p>
<p>There was no interest in the small Jiangnan foreign coin market in both the morning and afternoon, and no transactions were made, so the market prices were all nominally posted, the same as the previous day, at 6 qian, 5 fen, and 1.5 li. The Guangdong small foreign coin price was 6 qian, 5 fen, and 0.75 hao in the morning and 6 qian, 5 fen, and 0.5 li in the afternoon, with transactions made. The transaction volume was 80,000 jiao in the morning and 95,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins decreased by 1,000 wen, to 378,500 wen, with over 29,500 strings traded.</p>
<p>▲ Silver and Foreign Coin Inflow and Outflow</p>
<p>"Silver funds": Yesterday, the banks received and disbursed moderate amounts of information. Chinese merchants received and disbursed 2.3 to 2.4 million in drafts, foreign merchants received and disbursed 1.5 to 1.6 million in drafts, special funds received and disbursed 2.8 to 2.9 million, various cargo, exchange, tax, and miscellaneous funds received and disbursed over 8.1 million, pledged fund transactions were 700,000 to 800,000, 1.4 million was deposited into warehouses, money shops and silver public offices received and disbursed over 48.8 million, discount funds received and disbursed over 4.1 million, and remittance funds from various routes received and disbursed 700,000 to 800,000, with over 1 million disbursed in cash. "Foreign funds": 1.195 million in exchange drafts were made in the morning, and 811,000 in the afternoon. 115,000 in banknotes were made in the morning and 70,000 in the afternoon. Banknotes outside the market were 85,000 in the morning and 130,000 in the afternoon. Bank trading was 600,000 in the morning interbank market and 550,000 in the afternoon. Foreign accounts between banks received and disbursed over 1.6 million, with 2.2 to 2.3 million in banknotes recovered and issued. Money shops and foreign public offices received and disbursed over 6.2 million, foreign discount funds received and disbursed over 1.8 million, and foreign fund lending and borrowing amounted to over 1.5 million. The source from other locations was over 700,000, and transactions from small money shops were over 700,000.</p>
<h3>The Stagnant Situation in the Securities and Bond Market</h3>
<p>▲ Stable Trend with Minimal Fluctuations</p>
<p>▲ Major Investors Watch Cautiously, Market is Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw continuous scarcity of spot transactions in various bond markets, with only 12,000 yuan opened for the entire day. The futures market remained sluggish, with both buyers and sellers remaining quiet throughout the day. Apart from the relatively high volume of transactions in the 20 Customs Consolidated Salt Tax, the others were very quiet, and the 96 Consolidated Six Customs Tax, etc., were even more deserted. It is estimated that over 5.5 million was traded in the morning, and only 2.2 million in the afternoon, totaling 7,775,000 yuan. The market sentiment has become increasingly stagnant, and the entire day has been trapped in a state of fluctuation without any major changes. In the early morning, several types of bonds were relatively weak, such as the Disbandment and Troop Reduction, which continued to decline by one yuan, but rose again in the afternoon. The rest of the fluctuations were less than one yuan, and the results continued to fall slightly compared to the previous day, by only a few jiao. However, the 19 Customs September Six, the 19 Disaster Relief, and the 20 Customs Salt Tax, etc., saw a slight rebound in the next month's contracts, while the Financial November contract and the 20 Customs spot contracts each fell by one yuan. The Disbandment spot contract fell by as much as 2.8 yuan compared to the beginning of the week. The reason why the bond market prices are so sluggish is that the diplomatic uncertainties remain, the ambitions of the Japanese have been exposed, and it is questionable whether the League of Nations can stop the aftermath. Therefore, the general public continues to be extremely uneasy. Currently, our country is maintaining calm, and all parties are awaiting the development after the reopening of the League of Nations meeting next Monday. In the meantime, everyone is watching, so if there are no further violent acts within the day to make the situation more serious, the bond market will remain stagnant and difficult to see any major ups and downs.</p>

<h3>The Cotton Yarn Market: Morning Low, Afternoon Rebound</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon, but the trend appeared slightly stable. However, most retail investors, due to the tangled situation and tight finances, unanimously expected a fall. However, the anti-Japanese movement remained intense, making it difficult to increase inventory, and relying solely on local yarn was insufficient to supply demand. Therefore, warehouses were not heavily stocked, and a certain major merchant purchased in November and December in preparation for receiving goods, so the price rebounded slightly in the afternoon. However, judging from the overall situation, there is a possibility of stabilizing at a price of 52-53 taels.</p>
<p>▲ The Spot Market: Extremely Weak in the Near Term</p>
<p>At the exchange spot opening, the market was weak due to the sluggishness of American cotton and falling gold prices, and selling pressure remained strong. The near term fell by 1.5 qian, and the far term fell by 5, 6, and 8 qian. In the afternoon, a certain major merchant purchased, leveling the near term and raising the far term by 3, 4, 5, and 6 qian. The transaction volume totaled 43,100 bales. Yuda sold 3,100 bales, Gengfeng sold 3,100 bales, and Changfeng sold 1,350 bales. Rongxing bought 3,100 bales, Daji bought 1,300 bales, and Xincheng bought 1,000 bales. The closing prices for spot contracts are listed below:</p>
<p>Spot Closing Price	Change	Inventory Account</p>
<p>January 1528	Down 11	45,650</p>
<p>February 1550	Down 2	77,350</p>
<p>December 1532	Down 15	72,900</p>
<p>March 1553	Up 1	61,500</p>
<p>January 1540	Up 10	82,550</p>
<p>April 1552	Up 3	31,200</p>
<p>▲ Current Yarn Customers Have Weak Appetite</p>
<p>Sales of current yarn were flat. It is estimated that all firms purchased a total of 400 bales, and 60 bales were taken in by counterparts. The market was average. Customers from inland areas brought in 60 bales, Changsha brought in 100 bales, Yunnan brought in 50 bales, Sichuan brought in 30 bales, Northern firms brought in 25 bales, Haizhou brought in 25 bales, and miscellaneous firms brought in 50 bales.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Gradually Becoming Unsustainable</h3>
<p>The cotton market is gradually showing signs of weakness. Due to the sharp drop in gold prices, breaking the 60-tael mark, and the oversupply of exchange, the cost of American cotton is particularly cheap. Various factories have also purchased large quantities of it, and the demand for domestic cotton has been completely taken over by foreign cotton. The price difference between spot cotton and foreign cotton is a huge 8-9 taels. This situation is rare in history, so the future of spot cotton feels particularly dangerous. However, bulls and cotton merchants are holding tight due to the small amount of spot goods, so the market is currently calm, but in the future, there may be a drastic change.</p>
<p>▲ Han Spot Falls by 2-3 Qian</p>
<p>At the opening of the Han spot market, the market sentiment was flat and weak due to the falling American cotton and gold prices, and each fell by 5 fen to 2 qian. In the afternoon, news spread that manufacturers had purchased large quantities of foreign cotton, and gold prices broke the 590-tael mark, so the market sentiment was slightly weaker, and each fell by 1 qian to 2 qian. The transaction volume totaled 8,760 dans. Gengfeng sold 9,000 dans, Changfeng sold 2,400 dans, Tianlong sold 2,100 dans, Hengde sold 1,500 dans, Yongda sold 2,100 dans, and Yuda sold 1,700 dans. Jifeng bought 2,500 dans, Xinheng bought 5,000 dans, Mingde bought 2,000 dans, Taixing bought 2,200 dans, and Tongxing bought 4,000 dans. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Han Spot Closing Price	Change	Inventory Account</p>
<p>November 3200	Down 10	108,000</p>
<p>December 3145	No Change	172,000</p>

<p>▲ Foreign Cotton: Another 15,000 Bales Opened</p>
<p>Another 15,000 bales of foreign cotton were opened, with the source being 600 bales of Yao flower.</p>

<h3>The Decline of American Cotton Shows No Sign of Stopping</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton weakened due to the sluggishness of Wall Street, resulting in reactionary selling. The lack of major buyers led to a weak market. Futures fell by 7 to 10 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. British cotton futures fell by 12 points, and spot prices fell by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 10 points. Speculators bought Indian cotton, while European exporters sold. Pingguo fell by 0.75 rupees, Omra rose by 0.25 rupees, and Bairuo Creek fell by 1.25 rupees. The original telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>American Cotton	Compared to Previous Day	Converted to Shanghai Standard	British Cotton	Compared to Previous Day	Converted to Shanghai Standard</p>
<p>December 655	Down 8	24.80	January 473	Flat	28.20</p>
<p>January 663	Down 8	25.10	February 474	Down 1	28.30</p>

<h3>The Grain Market: Rain and Weaker River Transport</h3>
<p>▲ Nantou</p>
<p>Yesterday, continuous rain limited the supply from various firms. Due to the financial situation, the local market was weak, and sales were extremely slow. The number of river cargo husks opened was less than 500 shi, which led to price increases at Xixin, Zhongguan, Tongli, and Beidang. The Zero Fragment species in Baggio also had no appetite. Luyang Sharp rice, affected by Saigon rice, opened lower by one jiao. There were no glutinous rice Yinyuan goods on the market.</p>
<p>▲ Xinzha</p>
<p>Yesterday morning was cloudy and rainy, and transactions in various stores were sparse. New goods were quoted one jiao higher than the previous market. Rice from kilns and early rice showed a downward trend, as there was still ample inventory and market sentiment was weak. Sales of Du Sharp, Yang Sharp, and Bu Sharp were poor, and transactions among rural firms were extremely weak, making it difficult to improve the overall market. The number of river cargo husks was 2,000 shi.</p>
<h3>Current Foreign Rice is Being Purchased and Packed by the Northern Gang</h3>
<p>▲ Foreign Firms Continue to Release Futures Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign rice market, spot goods were still actively traded, because in addition to continued purchases from local merchants, the Northern Gang has begun packing operations. The overall market opened with a small batch of over 1,000 bags, split evenly between local merchants and the Northern Gang, with prices ranging from ten dollars and three cents to ten dollars, two cents, and two mills. After the small batch of spot goods was handled by the Northern Gang, there was an expectation of continued price increases in the market. However, this was affected by the sharp drop in gold prices, which in turn influenced exchange rates. Foreign firms were very keen to release goods, and prices also decreased slightly. Spot rice was consequently affected. Foreign firms offered 4,000 tons of futures for February and March, with February at four taels and eight mace, and March at four taels, nine mace, and one fen, a decrease of almost one qian compared to last week.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Trend Downward Consistently</h3>
<p>▲ South Seas Gang Absorbs Slightly Before Closing</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, after the opening bell both in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months showed a uniform downward trend. Although there were no quotations for foreign wheat, the trend in the gold market remained weak. The 600-tael mark was broken, and with the rise in exchange rates, sellers of foreign wheat continued to flood the market. Rumors circulated that Australian wheat was being quoted at only four taels and one qian. With such a shock, the weakness in investor sentiment was not unexpected. In the morning, all contracts saw consecutive declines, and the situation was even weaker at the afternoon opening. The lowest price for the current month even reached one tael and nine qian, and one tael and nine qian, seven fen and a half for December, a decrease of three to four fen compared to the previous day's closing. However, after the second trading session, it was heard that a portion of the South Seas Gang had been absorbing both near-term and long-term contracts, amounting to around 100,000, which slightly strengthened the weak investor sentiment. Compared to the lowest point, prices recovered somewhat, and it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a temporary stabilization. The result was that the current month fell by two fen and two and a half li compared to the previous day, December and January each fell by two fen, February fell by one fen and two and a half li, March fell by one fen and a half, and April fell by two fen.</p>
<h3>Both Near-Term and Long-Term Wheat Enter a Slump</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the wheat futures market, prices for all months showed a decline after the opening bell both in the morning and afternoon. With the situation in the north still tense, and flour sales sluggish, the prospects for wheat were naturally affected. Coupled with the sharp fall in gold prices, cooperation on foreign wheat was getting closer and closer. Currently, manufacturers are hesitant to make decisions, primarily due to the volatile political situation. If there is a turnaround in the international situation, continuous purchases will be inevitable. The pervasive weakness in investor sentiment is not without cause. Therefore, both near-term and long-term contracts have entered a slump, and it may be difficult to turn around in the short term. The result was that the current month fell by five fen compared to the previous day, December fell by eight fen, January fell by five fen, February fell by seven fen, March fell by six fen, and April fell by eight fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Trends Weaken Further</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the sugar market, news from producing regions indicated that spot Cuban sugar and New York sugar futures had not yet arrived. Spot Java sugar was priced at 7.625, and sugar futures for all months were at 7.75, with no significant changes compared to the previous report. Trading at the exchange was quiet. A small number of No. 24 Dutch raw white sugar transactions took place at a price of ten taels and three qian, and No. 20 medium white sugar at ten taels, a decrease of five fen from the previous day. The market appeared dull and lacked vitality, still showing signs of further decline. Transactions involving Taikoo sugar were also scarce. Although market inventory was not low, demand was sluggish, and the market followed a downward trend. B Mark was traded at eleven taels and six qian and a half, DY Mark at eleven taels and six qian, HX at eleven taels and five qian, and HM Mark at eleven taels. Buying interest was quiet, and the trend was slightly flat.</p>
<h3>Metals: Continuous Rain Makes Market Even More Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the metal market was sluggish due to continuous heavy rain. Transportation was inconvenient, so all guilds made no transactions. The Tianjin guild, due to the unreasonable provocations of the violent Japanese, received telegrams from all firms to suspend trading in all goods. Since the forcible occupation of the Northeast by Japanese soldiers, transactions had become hopeless. Therefore, the only guilds propping up the market were the Zhejiang and the Yangtze River merchants. Recently, however, the foreign exchange rate has risen sharply. Fearing significant changes in future prices, these guilds did not dare to take action rashly. As a result, there were many lookers-on but few transactions. Although inquiries appeared lively on the surface, actual transactions were exceptionally scarce. According to investigations, manufacturers and construction firms in the local area were under extreme financial strain, and there were no large-scale transactions. Consequently, the market felt a sense of desolation.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Waste Silk Origins Blocked</h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai Still Has Over 1,600 Bales in Storage</p>
<p>Since the violent occupation of Liaoning and Jilin by Japan, the situation in Northeast China has become increasingly tense. Recently, Japanese soldiers have colluded with local bandits to cause disturbances everywhere. Tianjin and other ports have declared martial law, and commercial markets in Yantai and Qingdao have been severely affected. Merchants dare not ship goods, and the source of waste silk has been blocked. Fortunately, with European and American silk sales slow, Shanghai warehouses still have over 1,600 bales of waste silk in stock. Yesterday, silk trading by foreign firms in Shanghai became even more quiet and sluggish, as actual sales by factories in Lyon remained stagnant. The price offered was still low, with B still only at 845 taels, while factories need 900-1,000 taels to break even, hindering sales. The market was quiet. Yesterday, ten bales of Su silk from a factory producing standardized yellow silk, and ten bales of Baiqian silk from the Public Security Bureau were traded. Chongchangdao bought and resold four bales. Prices remained flat and sluggish.</p>
<h3>Coal: Kailan Coal Dust Supply Cut Off</h3>
<p>Kailan Coal No. 2 dust was out of stock yesterday. Generally, peers who bought in were panicked. The market went up quite a bit, with the company's standard price rising to nine taels per ton, while small companies called for nine taels, five or six qian per ton, but there were no actual transactions. It is said that 6,000 tons of spot goods would arrive between tomorrow and the day after.</p>

<h3>French General Foch's Diary of the European War</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>On October 30th, Commander Catno designated the Tenth Army to fight north of the Gremecy Forest, and the Eighth Army to fight south of the Beichangqi Forest. Commander Catno believed that the two armies were of equal strength and arranged them this way. However, the Supreme Commander had slightly revised his plan. The Tenth Army, on the Meici River, was subject to lateral attacks and required a large force for cover.</p>
<p>On November 5th, Commander Petain notified Commander Catno of this revision. The next day, the arrangement was completed.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Allied forces began to concentrate in Lorraine. On November 6th, Commander Mangin and his staff also arrived at the front line.</p>
<p>Although Commander Petain expressed his desire to have the American 12th Division under his command (four divisions to cover the Tenth Army on the Meici River, and six or eight divisions to participate in the attack), in reality, he could not have so many American troops at his disposal. Moreover, our army paid close attention to the speedy start of the Lorraine offensive, because the importance of the opportunity to fight outweighed the quantity of troops. However, we still tried our best to supply Commander Petain with sufficient American troops. On one hand, we waited for the American First Army to arrive at the Meuse River before shortening its line of defense to transfer several divisions. On the other hand, I asked Commander Pershing to transfer the American Sixth Reserve Division (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Paper Tiger</h3>
<p>— Wenqing</p>
<p>Yuqing left the Hankou Provincial Girls' Middle School on August 7th and arrived in Shanghai, which is worshipped by foreign devils, on the morning of the 11th. She wanted to directly enter a national university. Later, because she failed two science subjects, she unfortunately fell short. She lived in a dormitory of a certain university for a week. Some days later, her teacher wrote to her, introducing her to a well-known girls' high school on Shanghai West Road to take remedial courses for a semester and then take the exam again. That might be a great help for learning English. She got a letter of introduction from her teacher and immediately ran to get a copy of the school's charter and inquired about the general situation of the school. She heard that the school had six or seven hundred female students. In her imagination, the school must be well-run, and the facilities may be as perfect as described in the charter. Therefore, she had decided to live in this school. On a Saturday afternoon, she first paid the fee of eighty-five yuan and moved into the school.</p>
<p>Yesterday at noon, I received a short letter from her, reporting that she was suffering from a fever and had been lying in bed for two days without getting up. I got this letter, and I felt inexplicably trembling in my heart. This is because my state of mind is too empty. Because a few days ago, a classmate died of poverty, and there was a girlfriend still in the hospital. Now, a unique sister from the same hometown is sick again. A wanderer in a foreign land is tossing and moaning on a sickbed. That is more bitter than drinking coptis tea. These are the tastes that I have tasted enough. So, I immediately locked the door and ran to the British Concession to see her. After a long time, I found her school. As soon as I walked into her bedroom, I was very surprised. How could such a small room have sixteen iron beds? Those small beds were arranged like small fishing boats on the stream, close to each other. Not only Yuqing was sleeping in bed in the bedroom, but also two or three students were moaning with her. That's like a third-class ward in a hospital. No, there may not be so many beds in the third-class ward.</p>
<p>A school with six or seven hundred students has no school doctor. This is too harsh on the students. Sometimes students lie in bed for two days, and the school authorities don't know it. If they know, they only drag the students to the hospital. Poor students who don't have money to go to the hospital have to die with their eyes open.</p>
<p>I sat on the edge of Yuqing's bed and asked about her illness. She said that the heat in her body had completely subsided, but she was a little weak. She shed a few tears on the pillow and tightly grasped my hand, telling me the contents of their school in detail.</p>
<p>Their principal is an old virgin who studied in a famous church university in Nanjing for two years. Her knowledge, in addition to reciting the English Bible very fluently, is also to ask the Chinese teacher for help to write a receipt. The school's funds are also very rich, charging students nearly five thousand yuan for tuition, food, and lodging each semester. Apart from the principal's own residence in a garden, a three-story foreign-style building, and eating Western food and going to foreign and luxurious dance halls, the money doesn't seem to have any other use. Because the school doesn't need to pay much salary, high school graduates from this school can teach high school one and two courses. They have a little service nature, and the school gives a little living expenses, which is enough. The other teachers are trusted by the principal. They only invite friends who can read a few foreign words to help her. The high school department, except for Chinese language courses, all other sciences are in the original English. Someone asked the principal why not use translated textbooks. She said that she couldn't hire good teachers. Is it really impossible to hire good teachers in Shanghai, where cultural talents are crowded together? It is really a trick to fool three-year-old children, and he will not believe it.</p>
<p>The teachers who teach the original text, there is no good one. Just invite a teacher to teach geometry, he often goes to the classroom, recites the theorem again, picks up the two corners, and draws a big circle on the blackboard, and often touches the lines of the white circle with his fingers. Sometimes his hands droop, and his eyes are fixed on the circle on the blackboard, as pious as praying in front of God. The classroom is only staring at his back, and some impatient students say,</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"Sir, please tell me quickly"</p>
<p>"Wait a minute..."</p>
<p>"It's been twenty-five minutes."</p>
<p>"Okay, you can prepare by yourself today, I will come again tomorrow to explain the theorem to you..."</p>
<p>He said, he gently put the chalk he was holding in his hand on the podium and sat quietly on a yellow paint chair, flipping through a hardcover geometry book. The students below, some do handicrafts, some read novels, some weave, some talk. Sometimes, he interferes with the students,</p>
<p>"Don't talk,"</p>
<p>"Sir, what do you do if you don't talk"</p>
<p>"You see, they are also doing their own things, if you have nothing to do, you should speak in a low voice, if the principal comes to hear, you must punish you,"</p>
<p>"Students deserve to die, teachers should live..."</p>
<p>A Ms. Wang sitting in the last row said, the geometry teacher's eyes flashed with anger, but after all, he didn't break out,</p>
<p>The principal, is really an economic master, the school's houses are mostly used for two or three purposes, the house on the east side is a little bigger, to be used as an auditorium, a cafeteria, and also a self-study room, the table arranged in this room, is the principal's unique idea to let the carpenter do, the table is square, the area is two feet wide, in order to suit the proportion of the area, the table legs are one foot and five inches high, small and interesting, no matter where, you can not find this style of table, if it is an ordinary table, then the house can only put down thirty tables, then, the small table can put down forty-five tables, when the students eat together, they are sitting back to back, if it comes to summer, the sweat from Student A's back can soak through Student B's clothes, because the table is too short, the students are bending over to eat, one by one like a shrimp, four bowls of side dishes and a bowl of soup are arranged in the center of the table, and there is not much space left to put the rice bowl, so, students often break the rice bowl, naturally breaking the rice bowl is the loss of the students, and also the interest of the school authorities, because the students broke a rice bowl for eight copper plates, and the students have to compensate two corners of the ocean, so, can each rice bowl not earn forty copper plates, if the students can break ten rice bowls every day, the school's electricity bill is also very abundant,</p>
<p>It is said that this school has been filed in the Ministry of Education, so it is more prestigious than other girls' schools, the most easy to call students' empty signboard, is that the school's foreign language is good, the students who graduated from high school, although they can not write Chinese letters, but at least can speak a few fashionable English,</p>
<p>The principal has a special privilege for the students, for the new students, as long as there is money, you don't have to take an exam, you can move into the school to live, it doesn't matter if the students go to class or not, as long as the money is in hand, like this, a school can accommodate six or seven hundred students, this is not a strange thing,</p>
<p>From this, we can know that this school, is completely a paper tiger, on the surface, it is majestic, if you poke the paper tiger with your fingers, you will know that the inside is empty, like this educational master, for the sake of personal welfare, I don't know how many young female compatriots have been harmed, I can't help but sigh for them,</p>
