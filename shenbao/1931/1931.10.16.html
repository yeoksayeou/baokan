<p>（哈爾濱）張海鵬軍十四晚、過江橋站、爲黑軍于兆麟旅所阻、未得前進、十五晨因未入佔黑省垣、（十五日專電）</p>
<p>（哈爾濱）交通界息、于兆麟本下令該旅、退往肇東、遵奉平副部電、不起衝突、惟士兵憤甚、誓與賣國奴拚、不聽長官命令、炸燬江橋、與張部對抗、十五晨發生激烈戰事、張旅萬七千餘、有日飛機兩架助攻、于旅祗五千、但皆防俄役韓光第舊部、勇悍善戰、張軍遂未得越過、張海鵬爲東北元老派、張學良秉政、委鄒作華興安區督辦、位在張上、張不快、此次遂藉日勢作亂、（十五日專電）</p>

<h3>日本意圖延宕</h3>
<p>擬請國聨派委員團來華作一般的調查延至明春行决議一面準備直接交涉</p>
<p>（東京）日本政府現正考慮要求國聨理事會對於遼吉事件延至明春再行决議、并欲請國聨派一委員會至中國、作一般的調查、惟仍不能同意於第三者之干涉、欲使國聨對於中日關係之歷史與背景、獲得日方所謂之公正報告、然後根據此項報告、作成决議、故擬向理事會擬議即行休會、俟明春再行討論此案、此時日本即準備與中國開直接外交談判、解决兩政府間各項懸案、昨日日外相幣原在貴族院各派代表前論及滿案、謂日本非俟得一解决中日間現在諸爭端之根本基礎後、不能撤兵、日本所處地位、認國聨理事會對於所以釀成中日緊張關係之種種情况、尚未得充分報告、而目下日内瓦各代表未免聆中國種種宣言後、發生不正當印象、因此日本欲國聨派一委員團至中國調查一般情形云云中國對於日本抗議抗日運動之復文、已於星期二夜間到東京、但日外務省已决定擱置不理、（十五日電通社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聨秘書處接東京消息、日政府刻正考慮請國聨派國際委員團赴華作一般的調查節、已發生深刻印象、視爲在解决中日滿洲糾紛上第一次所見具體之可能性、因一方面旣與中國請派國際調查委員會之要求、有一部份類似、而另一方面又可不致引起日本反對第三者之干涉、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本樞密院聆内閣三次陳述遼吉事件後、今日會議席上决定對於内閣、予以贊助及激勵、散會後、各樞密顧問大臣又開會議、承認若槻首相近日遍訪各重臣、係欲商得全國一致行動之最好方法、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日中國代表團接到政府來電、切實否認東京所傳出中政府如確知國聨不干涉、即準備與日政府直接談判之說、今日午後中代表施博士以昨今兩日南京發來電報五通、送交國聨秘書長、其中有一電、報告日飛機轟擊錦州、共炸死十九人、日飛機向懸掛紅十字旗之鐵路醫院、亦施攻擊、又一電係上次週會蔣主席報告之譯文、内有國際公法大約不能維持時、吾人不惜任何犧牲、以盡吾人責任等、並未揚言開戰、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<h3>日本不贊成邀請美國列席</h3>
<p>竭力避免外來干涉</p>
<p>（東京）日外務省對於美國代表出席國聨行政會、决定加以反對、本晚由幣原外相將此旨訓電芳澤大使、（十五日電通社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日國務院中人稱、美代表吉伯特如被邀列席國聨理事會、僅將受以正式討論凱洛格非戰公約、及其應否適用於滿案之權、惟在非正式方面、對於一切國聨提議、固仍可自由發言、第在正式討論時、祇將限於前項範圍云、（十四日國民社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國務卿史汀生今日聲稱、渠已派日内美總領事吉伯特俟理事會邀請後、充任美代表前往列席、此項委派尚係星期一决定、但據日内瓦報告、恐日本將反對美國參加、因此吉氏猶未列席國聨會議、又中國代辦容揆今日否認報載中日間已在東京開始直接談判之說、（十四日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日國聨中人極注意美國之能否列席討論、以爲美國一旦列席後、將見國附間最大合作、可爲異日樹立極重要之先例、故各代表及國聨辦事員皆急盼日政府之决議、以便努力進行解除中日危機、至今日各代表間對於滿案之私人談話、聞仍無甚進步、（十四日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）行政會議長白里安與其他會員、今日午後繼續秘密談話、聞議長現竭力欲使各會員對於邀請美代表參加行政會關於中日交涉之討論一事、意見一致、但行政會若有一會員根據法律理由、反對非國聨會員國代表參加行政會、則行政會可不理會此種反對、不過美政府遇此種情形、願否許其代表與會、正未可知耳、國聨方面對於此事、羣相討論、結果如何、甚爲人注意、因此事將成日後之成例也、日代表團聲稱、芳澤尚未接到東京關於此事之正式訓令、又謂美國旁聽員雖、列席於國聨所組織之各種委員會、但迄至今日、從未有非國聨會員國列席於國聨行政會之前例、現正愼重檢閱國聨組織法、以查明此事在法律方面究應如何云、大約日政府對於美代表列席行政會會議之態度、將取决於國聨憲章之嚴格解釋、英代表團今晚表示意見、以爲關於美代表列席行政會事之此後一語、必須來自美政府、美國願其代表以顧問員資格列席行政會與否、必須由美政府决定之、查美國曾於違法藥品貿易及籌備軍縮大會兩委員會中參加國聨工作、惟邀請美國參加行政會討論之發生問題、則爲第一次也、美國駐日内瓦之非正式旁聽員吉爾白、現與其政府有密切之接洽、大約已將此事商諸美政府、但尚未接覆電、今夜有關係方面預料日本不致拒絶美國之參加、並聞華盛頓現已有電到此、衆信吉爾白可以美國旁聽員與會、行政會大約明日可舉行公開會議、同時衆人目光咸集於東京與華盛頓兩處、亟欲知其解决中日交涉之態度與政策、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦每日電聞今晨社論、希望日本不反對美代表參加國聨行政會、謂此種討論、日本非不與聞他國一致贊同之决議、照理論言、日本自應接受、苟行政會以爲日本所爲、實超過保護其滿洲利益</p>

<p>之必要、則忠於履行其國際義務之一國、亦勿庸以受指導於世界執政者之公論爲辱、如其不然、而拒絶擁護日内瓦之提議、則旣無益於日本所固有之道德上地位、且亦傷害國聨、而强迫其執行爲世界和平之責任、同時在遠東問題中極有利害關係之美國、將依然立於國聨之外云、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日外務省發言人今日言論、含有日本將拒絶美代表參加國聨行政會提議之意、據謂美國之參加國聨之討論、乃永遠的、日本定爲歡迎、但參加僅以中日間爭執爲限、則此政策似不公允、且不合理、日本將不願依允云、外務省現尚未接到芳澤向政府請示之電、日人意見以爲日本應付滿洲時局、與國聨應付同、確信日本理由絶對正當、而其行動亦始終不外乎公道意識之支配、故未有拒絶美國參加行政會提議之理由、但從前未曾有過國聨邀請未入國聨之美國參加行政會討論情事、今獨因目前遠東事件開一例外、旣非必要、亦屬不公、但若美國欲以此次參加爲成例、而參加此後因其他世界問題如阿爾巴尼亞國困難等事而召集之行政會會議、則此破例之舉、實爲可賀之事不過美國願否如此陷入國聨中、殊不可必耳、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日政府已訓令日内瓦日代表芳澤竭力疏通國聨行政會、打銷美國參加討論滿洲問題之提議、因恐此舉如必實行、則將在日本民衆上發生甚不幸之影響也、芳澤關於此次提議之來電、東京僅接到一部分、須視全電收到時、日政府方可有切實之答覆、此間日人之意見、美國務卿史汀生十月十日致國聨秘書長之電慫恿國聨用其所有力量以調節中日行爲此種措詞、日本當局認爲非必要的嚴厲、東京因此業已發生不美滿之印象、故若美國在中日爭端中破例參加行政會之討論、則恐美日邦交將愈惡化、蓋日人將覺美國對於日本與中國交涉事件、横加不公允之壓力也、政府之反對美國參加、具有三種理由、（一）原則問題、（二）表明日本無庸第三者參加自行解决爭執之政策、（三）恐日本民衆疑慮美國干涉日本事件、致起仇美情感、再最足激動日本輿情者、莫過於外來之干涉、尤以來自美國者爲甚、蓋民衆將以爲外來勢力於日本自信舉動不錯之時壓迫日本行其所不願行者、且陸軍得人民同情、日政府深恐激動民衆、至使陸軍愈形掘强耳、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日内瓦現候東京覆命、惟在此各要人刻仍進行其私人談話、但非至日本决定願否美國參加討論後、國聨行政會之實際工作、不能進行也、昨晚芳澤對白里安談話時、言及美國參加事、態度較前温和、今晨白里安晤英外相李定及行政會其他理事、告以昨晚與芳澤私人談話情形、此間尚未得日本須美國允於將來參加國聨各種爭端、方可承認其參加此次討論之確報、而日代表團在東京訓令未到時、亦不欲多所發言、此間美人方面亦不知日本方面有此意見、但若日本態度果係如此、則當然須待美國之聲明、因國務院未正式允其代表參加行政會討論時、行政會自不便發請書與美代表也、行政會雖暫未開會、但中日事件仍爲人人所注意、此以此間各敎會組織和平祈禱會、可見斑、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）英法德意西班牙所組成之行政會委員會、午前集議於國聨秘書處、繼續研究中日雙方爭執之各要點、决定今日午後五時召集行政會全體之非公開會議、豫料日本覆文是時當可到此、西班牙代表之加入委員會會議、因中日問題初在國聯提出時、西班牙外相勒樂實爲代理議長也、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日政府今日决定不贊成美國列席國聨理事會旁聽、已由外務省於下午五時訓令日代表芳澤不予同意、同時又訓令駐美大使出淵通知美政府、不必派旁聽代表列席國聨理事會、因此舉不僅開、惡例、且將使國聨與美政府俱有爲難處、按日政界對此初有贊成之說、嗣忽聲稱、此次國聨純係考慮遠東問題、日本未見有請美國列席之正當理由、至於軍閥則始終反對此舉云（十五日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日内瓦人士等待日本答覆之際、對於中日爭端加意研究、日本人士聲言、按照國聨會盟約邀請美國參加會議、恐有害於盟約之完整、蓋請美國列席行政院無異增加一種僅享權利而不負義務之特殊會員、又稱、世人若謂有關係國家均可參加會議、則蘇俄曁他國亦應邀請、若欲援引非戰條約、則凡經簽字各國均當邀請、以上日本人士所言雖不無理由、但國聨會中温和派則答以日内瓦與美國　意見一致、已一月於茲、未聞日本表示不快、現正討論之案、業已極端擴大、决非形式問題之爭、所能阻其順適發展、總之中日爭端已向世界輿論提出、日本若以手續爲口實、而阻礙和平事業、所負責任至爲重在、日内瓦人士莫不以此爲言、（十五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據日内瓦來電、日本答覆頃已接到、其文甚長、并列舉種種理由、用以說明未便贊成行政院邀請美國參加會議之决議案、英法德義西五國代表業已討論日本答覆文之意義、其原文將、午後行政院開秘密會議時提出、秘密會議終了以後、或將舉行公開會議、據本社所知、行政院將不顧日本反對而維持其决議案、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國報紙皆評論國聨行政會邀請美國代表參加中日爭端之討論事、有謂此舉將使問題之解决因以延緩者、但白里安之外交手腕終可謀解决方法云、又有數報謂中國方面或不能無錯、但此問題之解决、大半繫於日本所表示之好意的姿勢、日本爲强有力而組織較佳之國、如能作此種姿勢、定可增其聲望云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>國際聨盟未必有大成就</h3>
<p>美參議員波拉之談片</p>
<p>紐約參院外交委員會主席波拉今日對客聲稱、余意國聨之從事解决遠東爭端、未必有大成就、美國不致被牽入此事至任何大程度、和平大約將藉其他各國代表與日當局接觸而告成云、（十五路透社電）</p>
<p>紐約美參院外交委員長波拉今日聲稱、渠信華會九國公約在此次中日間滿洲爭執中、當可證明其價值、又信美國當可不致大爲牽入漩渦、渠自有應付時局意見、但不欲評論美政府行動、暫時亦不欲發表其恢復中日間和平之意見云、（十四日國民社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>注意芳澤之致詞</h3>
<p>十三日國聨行政會議續開。日總代表芳澤曾有一極長之致詞對於此次暴行應負之責任。與應如何尊重國聨盟約。解决當前關係世界危局諸問題。曾無絲毫具體確切之表示。而舉超出當前事實以外之浮泛問題。故作遁辭。世界各國。尤其是我國家應認識日代表此種遁辭。爲一種極其毒辣之外交手段。在其視若浮泛不切實際之致辭中。實含有絶大之作用而其所齗齗陳述者。則適爲日本軍閥政客歷年　來所宣稱之主張。</p>
<p>綜。合芳澤致辭中之重要各點。第一。爲認定日本與我東北三省以經歷兩次戰役。發生合法之特權關係。第二。爲認定我東北三省。爲日本生存之所繫。日本在此應有經濟的與政治的特殊權益。第三。爲認定我東北之開發。爲日人獨有勞績。且聲明日本對我東北並無侵佔土地之野心。而且絶對歡迎各國投資東北。實行機會均等之主張。第四。爲認定日本之不能撤兵。由於中國人民目前之激昂心理之足以危害日僑之安全在此深關世界安危。各國政治家外交家齊集一堂之大會中。提出上項意見。其所計者遠。蓋不僅着目在當前問題的是非曲直之爭辯也。</p>
<p>芳澤此次之致辭。即無異於申述我東北三省爲其中日日俄兩次戰役之戰利品。享有特殊利益。分所當然。次之。日本地小民稠。資源缺乏。向我東北求生存出路。蓋爲人道所允許。事實所必至。開發我東北。爲日人之力。我國人不預。持此種似是而實非之理由。以求獲得世界各國之諒解。塞各國之口更進一步。表明日人無獨佔我東北之野心。開發之機會當與世界共之日人特爲此機會之保護者。以此對世界各國暗送秋波。企望各國「心心相照。」尤其是美國於機會均等之主張。不能再有所發言。尤有甚者。彼不僅企圖緩和世界各國干涉之空氣。抑且欲藉國聨之力。以抑制我國人民之排斥日貨運動。其外交手段之縱横椑闔。有如是者。</p>
<p>芳澤所宣示之似是而實非之理由。實與彼國軍閥政客歷來所鼓吹宣傳者。同一鼻孔出氣。其强横無理。吾人已迭次力闢其荒謬。今不必再置辯駁。吾人今之所欲言者。爲世界各國應注意當前問題。不爲簡單之權益問題。而爲關係世界安危之整個問題。日本破壞中國領土政治主權之完整。置中國民族於生一鎭綫上。而予以嚴重之威脅。國際如不主持公道。維護和平。則中國實逼處此。無法廻避。自惟有竭盡全力以與日本周旋。斯時將予世界以若何重大之影響。任何人當能想像。故當前之問題。惟有抑制日本之暴行。解除其威脅我民族生命之武裝。否則决無以拔除當前觸機即發之危局。世界各國應。注意目前中國忍無可忍之激昂民氣。萬勿爲日人之狡辯。與機會均等之甜言蜜語所煽惑。</p>
<p>至於我全體國民。尤應認清日人外交手段之毒辣目前聨盟行政會議上之折衝撙俎。實爲我國於國際間爲維護公理而奮爭之最後辯訴。前途如何。實難逆斷。我政府應益知所以努力。應知所以應付與奮鬥。我全體國民。則尤應勿存依賴他人扶助之心理。應急起作萬一時候之必要準備。</p>

<h3>張作相電吉聲明熙洽僞命無效</h3>
<p>熙洽月助日軍費二十萬日金</p>
<p>吉林通信、吉林省政府主席張作相氏頃有電到吉、諭令各機關、凡在大局未定期内、所有吉林省長官熙洽之一切命令、完全無效云云、聞吉林省政府將移往哈埠辦公、卸職之財政廳長榮厚、已於前日赴哈、（是否與此有關、尚待證明、）其他各卸任人員、亦均準備離省、</p>
<p>自熙洽就任僞長官後、本省各鎭守使、經熙洽改爲警備司令、陸軍獨立旅則改稱警備旅、省城警備司令兼警備第一旅長、熙洽已委前吉長鎭守使李桂林充任、就原二十五旅改編爲警一旅、該旅原任旅長張作舟、係張作相同宗、不受熙氏僞命、仍在榆樹縣境内屯駐、不允交卸、日昨熙洽特去函勸告、語極無恥、略謂東隣此舉、意在排除張副司令及輔帥、（作相）兄旣爲輔帥同宗、正當暫息仔肩、乃聞吾兄在榆意圖反抗、今何時耶、兄當知之弟處今日、不求國人諒解、但求有益吉人云云、甘爲日方鷹犬、可謂全無心肝、永衡官銀號庫内、聞目下尚存日金票二百萬元、鈔票三百萬元、此次劉燏棻爲該號總辦、日軍利用其親日、以便取携、用意在此、現熙（洽）劉兩人除以吉洋五十萬慰勞日軍外、並允每月補助日方軍費日金二十萬元、日來吉洋價值狂跌、每圓由銀洋七角而跌至五角、官帖實值更低、銀洋一元可抵五百餘吊、其原因即在於此、</p>

<h3>眞正日本人之言</h3>
<p>日本政府軍閥聽之</p>

<p>國際聨盟代表聽之</p>
<p>日本以暴力佔領我東省後、彼國東京帝國大學新聞（第四百號十月五日發行）載有横田喜三郎敎授所著「滿洲事變與國際聨盟」一文、以法學家之眼光及態度、披瀝對於此事之意見、以糾正其政府之失措、文中主要數點最堪注目者、舉之如下、（一）縱使破壞鐵道爲事實、至多亦祇能佔領北大營爲止、尚可强稱爲自衞行爲、其後舉動、完全出於自衞範圍之外、（二）日本不應以未確得安全之保障爲藉口、自違公約而不撤兵、（三）日本政府反對聨盟之共同調查及視察員之派遣、負有對外及對内重大之責任、（四）日本應先行撤兵而後交涉、不能以所謂滿蒙懸案爲撤兵之條件、如兩國交涉不能解决、則依盟約第十二條第十五條、應成爲聨盟之問題、（五）中國如提出前項問題於聨盟、日本若强辭廻避、不啻自白其要求之不當、（六）如兩國單獨交涉、不能平和解决之時、日本若更用武力、殊無辨解之餘地、且違反聨盟規約、以上數點、皆足爲吾國在聨盟會上發言之資助、此文發表後、所有炸擊錦州之舉、日本之横暴不法、更在横田氏意計之外、乃和會重開、日方代表猶堅執不得安全保障不允撤兵之說、頑横至此、不特無以對世界、抑亦無以對其國人矣、國聨代表、均爲各國外交上有數人物、果能不偏不倚、稍存公道、自當依法判斷、仗義執言、至少亦當不在檋横田氏下也、至我國對於此事、理直氣壯、尤應堅持到底、勿爲城下之盟、否則不爲横田氏所笑、不爲日本人所笑者幾希、茲譯原文如下、心南誌、</p>
<p>滿洲事變與國際聨盟</p>
<p>（日本東京帝大敎授法學博士横田喜三郎撰鄭心南譯）</p>
<p>一、據傳僅因數密達之鐵道被人破壞之事件、而南滿洲之要地、幾全爲日軍所佔領、更由軍部之獨斷、自朝鮮越國境出兵、事件擴大至此、致招聨盟撤兵之警告、於是軍部始喫一驚、即用非公式聲明不在聨盟所應容喙之範圍内、或斷然排斥第三者之干涉、然而聨盟之勸告、果爲越權之行爲乎、果爲第三者不當干涉乎、請不從利己的立塲、用公平正當之學者的態度、對此問題一考察之、</p>
<p>二、聨盟據規約第十一條、爲防止事件之擴大及撤兵之勸告、茲先應討論之問題、爲根據規約第十一條之勸告有當與否是也、該條約規定、凡遇戰爭或有戰爭之威脅時、爲擁護國際平和起見、聨盟應取適當而有效之措置、</p>
<p>今滿洲事件不爲戰爭、然爲有戰爭之威脅則無疑義、本來日本無欲戰之意思、最少一般之國民、絲毫無此意思、然而戰爭不必由自初即有戰爭之意思而起、由前方軍隊之衝突、不知不覺而引起戰爭之事、亦復不少、而且此種衝突、尤以如滿洲之事件、他國之軍隊出動於一國之領土内時、容易發生、故此次滿洲之事件、與條文所謂有戰爭之威脅之時、恰相適合、</p>
<p>由此結果、聨盟依規約第十一條而勸告、不能謂爲非當然之事、然則聨盟所勸告之内容果正當乎、如前所述規約上所規定爲擁護國際平和、應取適當而有效之處置、就勸告之第一點防止事件之擴大觀之、我人不能不認爲此種勸告完全爲有理由、軍部主張最初全爲自衞上必不得已之行爲、然嚴正公平觀之、軍部一切之行動、果能以自衞權而說明之乎、</p>
<p>鐵道之破壞、認爲事實、對於正在破壞之軍隊、加以反攻、確爲自衞權之行使、或進一步、追擊此軍隊而佔領北大營、欲謂爲自衞權之行使、亦無不可、但對攻擊北大營、幾於同時竟對於遼寗城内開始攻擊、亦得謂爲自衞上不得已之舉乎、况由破壞鐵道之衝突、（十八日午後十時半）僅六時間内外、距四百杆之北之寛城子竟被佔領、（十九日午前四時四十分）距二百杆之南之營口、亦被佔領、（同日五時）果亦可謂爲自衞上不得巳之行爲乎、而且此等地方之佔領、幾於無抵抗而行之、此尤不能不加注意者也、更進一步、藉口吉林與哈爾濱之形勢危險、二十一日以軍部之獨斷、自朝鮮越國境而出兵、是日之夕、據報「日軍一舉佔領吉林、吉林軍全無戰意」、（二十二日東京朝日新聞）而且傳聞當日閣議、陸相要求出兵、外相反對、終至不能决定、</p>
<p>依外相之見解、危險之程度、不至急迫至此、實際上以吉林無抵抗而竟被佔領一事思之、不能不謂外相之認識爲正當矣、由此觀之、最初之衝突及北大營之占領、縱可謂爲自衞行爲、至其後之行動、能一切認爲依據自衞權乎、抑不能乎、此殊充分成爲應行研究之問題、在此形勢之下、聨盟因事件之擴大而勸告、欲不謂爲極適當之措置不可、</p>
<p>勸告之第二點爲撤兵、此亦爲當然之事、普通軍隊對峙而有衝突之危險時、對於確保平和最適當而有效之措置、非撤兵不可、自無疑義、此次滿洲事件、日本之軍隊進出於駐兵權之鐵道附屬地以外、自朝鮮超超國境而出動、故以先撤去此等軍隊、始能確保平和、不能不謂爲當然之措置、</p>
<p>要之、聨盟之勸告、無論就勸告之根根勸告之内容而言、全屬正當、决非越權之行爲、亦决非不當之干涉、</p>
<p>三、日本承受聨盟之勸告形式上、似曾宣言已自動的取與勸告之同一處置、無論如何、因聨盟之勸告爲正當之舉、日本承受之爲當然之事、所餘之問題、爲實行而已、不消說、非公明正大忠實而實行之不可、</p>
<p>就勸告之第一點而言、幾於不成問題、吾料事件當無擴張至此以上之可能性、今所成爲問題者、第二點是也、傳聞最初軍部、欲乘此機會、將關於滿蒙諸懸案一舉而迫其解决、主張不至容納爲止、决不撤兵、外相終亦同意、然接聨盟之勸告、政府曾聲明本有自附屬地外撤兵於附屬地内之準備、而且最近不特不以外交交涉之成否、并不以其開始爲條件、對於聨盟發表至能確得安全之保障、即行撤兵、此固爲當然之措置、如果出兵、僅因自衞、則切迫之危害一去、在理應即撤兵、假如提出與此無直接關係之問題、而主張不能容納其要求之時、决不撤兵、則出兵果僅爲自衞與否、徒足啟人之疑竇而已、外交部抑制所傳聞之軍部之主張、不問外交交涉之成否、及開始與否、即獨立對聨盟公約撤兵、此雖屬當然之事、然亦足多矣、</p>
<p>今所餘之問題、爲此公約應忠實而實行之耳、不能以未確得安全保障爲口實、而違反公約、尤以反對聨盟之共同調查與視察員之派遣、在日本所負之責任、更爲重大、無論如何、非公明正大履行公約不可、而且此决不僅對於聨盟及美國有對外的責任而已、無寗第一爲對於國民之對内的責任、丨對於僅信爲因自衞而出之兵之一般國民、有重大之責任、</p>
<p>四、對於聨盟之關係、此事件并不全告完結、爲非注意不可之事、固然戰爭之感脅已去、僅就規約第十一條而論、對於聨盟之關係、業已告竣、但關於事件解决之交涉、則從此開始、尚有所謂滿蒙之諸懸案、以此等爲撤兵之條件、明爲不當、已如前述、但於撤兵之後、早晚對此之外交交涉、自當開始、此事如能以二國間之交涉解决、自無問題、如仍不能解决、則依規約第十二條及第十五條、亦得成爲聨盟之問題、</p>
<p>如中國以此問題提出於聨盟、當然日本非應之不可、如日本不欲以武力爲背景、强行其不當之要求、自應提出聨盟、作堂堂之主張、如强辭回避、是無異自白其要求之不當而已、</p>
<p>吾人非自始即反對二國間之單獨交涉者、僅就萬一不能平和的解决之時而言之耳、如此時再用兵力、則無論如何、無辯解之餘地、且將明白違反聨盟之規約、此事不敢謂其無此可能性、故預爲注意反之、</p>
<p>要之、吾人雖不能明知其爲聨盟勸告之效果、抑爲外交當局自動之抑制、幸而軍事行動、得於中途防止、不至擴大、然而事件則尚未解决也、第一爲撤兵之問題、第二爲外交交涉之問題、對於前者、吾人無寗非監視政府應忠守公約而實行撤兵不可對於後者、吾人無寗非監視其關於正當之要求只應用平和的手段而主張之不可、（十月十五日）</p>

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>主報告、謂該水手在途中投海自殺、但據調查、確係在輪中被日人謀害、屍體棄於海中、近來日人並公然放縱韓人在各地刦掠華僑財物、或由日人喬裝爲韓人、而襲擊華僑、故三島中之二萬華僑、均有寢食不安之感、歸國者日有數百、東京留學生、殆均去盡、和歌山全數退出、西京大阪去者三分之二、神户横濱去留參半、此次日本排華之劇烈、其嚴重情形、實不亞於朝鮮慘案也、（十月十日）</p>

<h3>日艦來青示威</h3>
<p>假名爲秋季檢閱</p>
<p>美潛艇避嫌離青</p>
<p>青島通訊、自遼變發生、日本艦隊在我中國沿海沿江各地、屢次有示威舉動、青島因特種關係、更爲日人所注意、早想藉口佔據、以遂其侵略野心、惟因師出無名、不便發動、且各國艦隊、留青者甚多、又恐一旦發難、惹起各國反感、是以本市得相安無事、不料近數日間、謡言四起、競傳日本將派大批艦隊來青、並有定十三日登岸之說、於是人心惶惶、市面極現不安狀態、迨至今（十二）晨八時、果有日本第二遣外艦隊驅逐艦刈萱·朝顔·芙蓉·三艘進港、與前日來青之旗艦球磨、同泊前海、作一字形、九時半美潛水艇九艘、離青他去、人心更爲動摇、並傳言日艦士兵將於十三日遊行市内示威、杯弓市虎、謡言更甚、但據日領事館駐在武官藤原對人表示、該艦隊每年秋季、例有檢閱之舉、今年因旗艦球磨在青、故檢閱之舉、在青舉行、已規定十四日檢閱、十五日休息、十五日晚或十六日晨、離青開旅順、此事已與東北海軍司令部先期接洽、即兵士偶然登陸、亦係至日本忠魂碑參拜、並無其他用意云云、</p>
<p>山東因連年荒歉、各地人民赴東三省謀生者、歲以數十萬計、刻東北爲暴日侵佔、該地人民之生命財産、均已失其保障、於是旅居東北之魯籍人民、爭思脫離虎口、遄反故里、故連日由大連來青之船、莫不滿載此項難民、昨日奉天丸抵青時、載來一千五百餘人、多半乘膠路車轉回原籍、故昨晚一次車西上時、車上擁擠不堪、該路因車少人多、無法收容、臨時增掛客車兩節、車上仍有人滿之憂、今（十二）晨五次車及十二時之三次車西上時、車上難民仍無隙地、據調查近兩日中難民乘車西上者、巳有三千餘、（十月十二日）</p>

<h3>日本擁護滿蒙權益秘密會議紀錄譯要（再續）</h3>
<p>帝國國防重地、如興安嶺一帶、及開魯五常等、爲戰時軍團重要陣營、如長春哈爾濱安達等、爲戰時軍團給養及軍馬高糧等補充及徵發之重要區域、無不被奉派以東西大幹線所衝破、或被其掣肘、······軍縮條約成立之今日帝、國期待滿蒙爲唯一之國防重心、所幸如前記各地點······除我軍部要人與重要外交當局而外、别無他人知覺、······如此秘密、奉派必莫由察知、而特計劃該鐵道。以妨害我、蓋欲發展其經濟、而爲此偶然之凑合、夫彼旣以經濟爲主要點、則我國以何等利益與之交換、或能達到阻止之目的。萬一彼受赤俄軍事家之指導、或竟自己所感不幸悉與我同、······則必須先以何等策略誘止其就範、然後别出奇計以阻止之、······依參謀部之意兄、欲以其東西二大幹線之建設確有妨害帝國國防云云爲題、而要求廢止之、······無如奉派之外交詞令、非常狡展、彼必謂其東西二大幹線之建設、純以堅固自國國防、及開發滿蒙爲目的云云以拒我、則我豈非自塞其進路、而不能繼續發言乎、</p>
<p>歐美資本家每視張學良治下爲其銀箱安全放置地帶、自東北易繼以來、其漫然欲投資於滿蒙者、共有八大團體之多、其中如紐約財團者、本有意交托滿鐵會社放資於滿蒙、亦因東北易幟、而中國方面及駐華美使之宣傳、一轉遂拒絶與滿鐵提携、密派調查來滿、一意欲以奉派爲對手、爲直接放資之計劃、幸當時帝國利用新聞及駐歐美財務官作種種中傷之宣傳、而有馮闖内亂之爆發、故得阻止之、豈料自閻馮軍失敗而後、張學良復以其老獪之外交手腕、粉飾統一政府之形骸、於是歐美資本團對滿投資之野望、更倍於前···而尤重視關於鐵道之放資、依外務省最近所接派駐美英官吏之報告、僅彼二國之資本家、目下極力計劃放資於滿蒙鐵道事業者、共有十五團體之多、······失如是、奉派雖自無財力可完成其所計劃之各鐵路、然彼藉其假統一政府爲招牌、僅以一筆之簽押、自可向歐美資本國借得盈千累萬之資金、况歐美資本家處極度放欵難之今日、吾人深信其必將趨之若鶩、而崇拜張學良如耶穌、從此歐美等國因欲確保其放資地盤之安全計、對於張學良之政權、必以何等手段擁護之、而帝國在滿蒙之行動、屆時必受種種掣肘、······爲國家百年計、事前必······杜絶歐美資金流入滿蒙、使其富源爲帝國所獨有、即主權者之奉派、亦無法與我分甘、······如彼眞爲開拓滿蒙須建設鐵道者、至少其所應用之建設費、必須向帝國借欵、帝國不論如何困難、亦能向英美轉借以貸之、</p>
<p>最慘者、莫如帝國在五常及長春等之國防重心地點、無不被其東部幹線所衝破、萬一有事之秋、憑帝國如何發揮日本海中心主義、帝國武至鐵道若吉會路者、縱如何精銳、奈陣地與南滿路及内地之聨絡、悉被包圍横斷、屆時帝國雖有千軍萬馬、恐亦不能保全興安嶺及開魯一帶要地、他如滿蒙駐軍戰時之給養、及軍需之運輸、因四通八達皆受遮斷、萬一奉軍以鐵道網之機能、由東北西三方面夾攻之、斯時也、南滿路必一轉而失却國防軍事上之能力、而帝國駐屯沿線及興安開魯一帶之國軍、不爲降虜、即須全覆、</p>
<p>帝國宜以奉派之無視條約及我國之抗議爲原因及機會、先責其失信、次則高調日華之共存共榮、求其許我實現吉會路旣得權、以作東部並行線建設之交換條件、倘能許我、則另餌以何等之物質的或精神的利益、亦於事無妨、况彼内部軋轢猛烈之今日、且與南京非誠意假統一妥協之今日、吾人深信其必能自覺己身終局之利害、而誠意接受帝國之交涉、······至少彼亦須中止延吉敦化線延吉吉海線吉林五常線等培養線之建設、······倘以如此之犧牲條件、而猶不能使彼滿足者、·······至少彼亦須許我實現海林延吉線之旣得權、而天圖鐵道應由帝國收買辦理、······夫如是、帝國雖不得實現武裝的吉會路、·······於我國防止及經濟上所受之損失、固亦無幾、因彼東大部幹線之工事、已達成十之七八、尤其是松花江流域之富源地、旣被其貫通、又旣與葫蘆島港相連接、任何干涉、亦難阻止、·······故對其東部大幹線之外交、不得不如此屈弱以處理之、</p>
<p>按葫蘆島港、不幸於不知不覺之中竟被實現者、皆因帝國自信過强、事前不阻止外國資本家與接近、致有今日之慘、然前車旣覆、後車可鑒、此後對外國資本家之欲投資滿蒙者、必須極力行使破壞中傷之策略、較諸直接干涉、更爲有效、且可粉飾日華親善之假面具、而高尚帝國之外交術、</p>
<p>更就其西部大幹線而檢討之、······幸其洮南與通遼之間尚未建設、此短距離之路線、如可阻止、······不僅帝國國防上之要防重地、如興安嶺及開魯或白音太來一帶、可免受其衝破及威迫、······且令彼之西部大幹線一變而成中斷之形、雖有旣成線路如鄭家屯至通遼間及鄭家屯至洮南間可以利用、無如迂廻曲折、計算其出海距離之哩數、較諸南滿路短縮無幾、我方如使運費與之同額、再在大連港减收飲水倉庫諸費、或更與貨主以金融之便利、並减輕其利息、吾人深信、此可以打消葫蘆島之眞價、綽綽有餘、乃挽救滿鐵與大連之最捷徑也、况通遼至洮南路線之設建、明明與南滿路並行、帝國出而阻止、實屬名正言順、倘奉派誠意聽從、則放棄開原海龍吉林五常間旣得之鐵道權利、以爲交換、亦無不可、尚有其西部大幹線之培養線、如長春扶餘洮南線、與洮安索倫滿洲里線、及安達洮南線等、無不串通北滿大富源地帶、雖直接受害者爲中東路、無如······我滿鐵之黄金滿軌時代及大連港之繁榮、其元素多自於方面得之、······况安達扶餘、爲帝國國防上軍馬及馬糧並興安嶺軍團重要給養補充與徵發之要地、而洮安洮南索倫一帶、係帝國現時最重要軍團駐屯之陣地、······倘此等培養線一旦實現、則帝國國防及經濟、無不被其衝破無餘、······幸其中如長奉扶餘洮南線與洮南索倫線等、無不與我長春大賚洮南索倫間旣得之鐵道權相抵觸、我如以此爲藉口而阻止之、亦堂堂正正依據條約之行勸、······如其不聽、則要求實現該旣得權以挾之、如彼竟许我實現此旣得權、則以此長大洮索線培養滿鐵、奪取其安達洮南間及索倫滿洲里閒各路之來貨、抽取葫蘆港之繁榮要素、而滋補我大連港、若再不可得、······則長春扶餘洮南索倫間、至少須與我合辦、帝國亦不惜犧牲長入路及光索路之旣得權、蓋奉派方汲汲於國權之收回、帝國不稍讓步、必能誘起極大之反抗、且令虎視眈眈之歐美資本家、更集中目光、猛進於滿蒙、而增長帝國之危機、（未完）</p>

<h3>痛心的話</h3>
<p>— 鵑</p>
<p>親愛的國人。我們天天熱望着可以制止日人暴行的國際聨盟行政會議。可又輕描淡寫的過去了。下一次的開會。不知尚在何日。此次我們所得的印象。就覺得國際聨盟這一味藥。實在不足以驅散我們的病魔。國爲藥性過於薄弱。服下去如湯沃石。而那些醫生呢。雖說所請的都是名醫。可是事不關已。也只隨隨便便的開了一張藥方。聊盡人事而已算了。現在要看病人怎麽樣。他自己能不能掙扎起來。和病魔奮鬭一下。要是掙扎不起的話。那麽死神就要降臨。還是料理後事吧。</p>
<h3>不除庭艸齊夫談薈</h3>
<h3>吳稚暉没有回的信</h3>
<p>今年國民會議開會之後。吳稚暉被推爲代表資格審查委員會委員長，胡淵有一封信給他，請他將代表的資格在報章上公布出來。這封信的大意如下：</p>
<p>「······看報知道先生被推爲國民會議代表資格審查委員會委員長，並且已經審查了三百多位代表的資格。我現在以國民一分子要問先生幾句話。就先生已經審查的結果看來。有幾位農民的代表是眞正的農民，有幾位工人的代表是眞正的工人？您或者會反問我：什麽是眞正的農民？什麽是眞正的工人？我可以下一個定義說：靠自己動手做工吃飯的人是眞正的工人：靠自己動手種田吃飯的人是眞正的農人。比如陶侃運甓我不能稱他爲磚匠，不能稱他爲工人。何以呢？陶侃靠做官吃飯不靠運甓吃飯。反過來說：王冕也讀書，我可以稱他爲農人，因爲他靠種田吃飯，不靠讀書吃飯。照這個定義看來，出席國民會議的農民代表有幾個是眞正的農民，工人代表有幾個是眞正的工人？請您公佈出來。······」</p>
<p>這封信始終没有得到回信。吳稚暉現在聽說要出洋。我想他老人家在出國之先，該把這筆賬結一結吧。</p>
<h3>書投筆從戎之女志士</h3>
<p>— 耘喰</p>
<p>邇者因暴日强佔我遼吉。舉國上下。莫不有悲壯熱烈之抗日運動。最近本市及通商口岸婦女界。復有義勇軍之組織紅妝鐵血。巾幗鬚眉。不讓前賢專美于前。良足多矣。唯是未見普及。爰將前輯中國女體校紀念刋中國女權運動史略篇。擇錄女志士數人。以當今日婦女之借鑒焉。</p>
<p>吳淑卿女士上書黎元洪。願投軍效力黎以軍中皆男子。難以位置。婉言辭之。淑卿復力辯男女不應有别。並證以吾國古來女軍人之歷史。侃侃而談。勇氣百倍。黎乃令别招女軍一隊。由淑卿主之。文告甫張。來者數百人。淑卿盡心敎練。不辭勞瘁。不數日間。而步伐整齊。精神充足。纖纖弱女。盡成糾糾之武夫。當民軍與清軍劇戰時。吳淑卿率女軍出背後擊之。清軍死者頗衆。淑卿生有膂力。尤富於智略。每戰必身先士卒。清軍一遇吳軍。肝膽爲裂云。</p>
<p>武漢倡義後。鄰近諸省相繼響應。惟南京張勳等負固不服。屢與民軍作戰。縱兵擄掠。地方糜爛。蘇浙滬各處民軍。聞南京受挫。咸奮勇作戰。誓滅此朝食。乃會師於鎭江。一致進行。並由滬軍都督陳其美發起。公推徐紹楨爲聨軍總司令。令吳木蘭組織女子北伐隊於滬。率女軍隊數千人助戰。用計攻克獅子山砲台。彈由吳之膝下穿過。於是各路軍隊。乘勝進攻。張人駿。張勳。鐵良。相率逃去。餘黨亦多竄出。而南京遂從此光復。</p>
<p>民軍起義失敗後。張鳴岐始出水師署。窮收黨人。騷擾殊甚。而有名吳尖娘吳七娘者。亦以身在軍中。嫌疑被逮。</p>
<p>上列數人。以身許黨國而投筆從戎者。夫今之國仇。尤重于推翻滿清。願吾婦女界三致意焉。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>澳洲流行的茶葉算命茶葉算命。本很流行於英美諸國。他們看了茶杯中茶葉的模樣。以卜休咎。據說很有喪騐的。現在却盛行澳洲。有一般人依此爲生。自命爲茶葉算命的專家。而大半的茶店中就僱用了他們。替主顧們算命。以廣招徠。</p>
<p>德國新發明的特别糊牆紙糊牆紙美麗可喜。雖爲家庭裝飾的要件之一。但是不能持久。終屬美中不足。最近德國有一位發明家。却發明了一種特别糊牆紙。用玻璃質化煉而成。永不退色。并可入水洗刷它的持久性且過於玻璃。因它不如玻璃的易碎。</p>
<p>荷蘭的製雨法　在天時久旱的時候。求雨不來。這眞是一件無可奈何的事。最近有一位荷蘭國的化學博士。曾試騐他的製雨新法。駕了飛機。飛得高高的直到雲端之上。將乾冰粉撒在雲中。不多時便有大雨紛紛下落。這乾冰粉是甚麽。便是二　化炭。（即炭酸氣）吾國的化學家。何妨一試。</p>
<h3>鐵血與公理</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>世界之最足恃者。惟鐵與血耳。」此爲畢士麥Ｂismarck之名言。日爾曼聨邦。遂一躍而稱霸全球。震撼萬國。是一言興邦之明證也。吾國以四億之人民。四百二十七萬餘方哩之土地。具五千年光華之文明。而竟屈伏於十四萬方哩之蕞爾島國。今乃俯首帖耳。而聽命於國際聨盟。涕泣滂沱。而一冀其主張公道。凡有血氣。能不痛心。强權在前。公理早經絶跡。吾人惟有臥薪嘗膽。刻骨銘心。以雪此奇恥大辱。</p>
<p>自東省倭宼侵入。救國熱潮。奔騰澎湃。青年血涙。與日俱增。十八齡之湘籍學生曾夔君。乃斷指血書。上海工友李錦山君。竟憤極自戕。全國學校全體動員。舉行救國運動。蒼凉悲壯。足證吾國民族精神之未死。</p>
<p>文化爲人類精神的産物。凡屬人羣均宜共守。乃暴日入據瀋陽。舉文化機關。重要建築而盡焚之。殘暴慘酷。自别於人類以外。當拿破侖之克服薩克遜也。氣蓋全歐。兵臨德勒斯登Ｄresden時。乃下手諭。嚴束部下。倘士兵之毁壞爲地文化建築者當繩以軍法。愚今春旅德城時。見其古皇宫之巍峨。敎堂及國家戲院之宏麗。歷時悠冬。而巍然尚存。迄今德人咸</p>
<p>樂道之。以視暴日之自詡文明。儼然以東亞主人翁自居者。其獸性之暴露。不攻自破矣。</p>
<p>比利時以藐小之國。據列强之間。僅一萬一千七百餘方哩面積。七百七十四萬人。歐戰勃興。與德對峙。卒能努力前驅。獲最後之勝利。吾國版圖三十倍於日本。四百倍於比利時。鵾鵬見困於燕雀凡屬國民。能不愧死。</p>
<h3>胡都聞見錄</h3>
<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>茶肆</p>
<p>天咫偶聞云。大通橋西堧下舊有茶肆。乃一老卒所闢。並河有廊。頗具臨流之勝。秋日葦花瑟瑟。令人生江湖之思。余數偕友過之。茗話送日。惜其水不及昆明。而茶尤不堪。大抵京師士夫無知茶者。故茶肆亦鮮措意於此。而都中茶皆以末麗　之。茶復極惡。南中龍井絶不至京。亦無嗜之者。此段述都中茗事。至可玩味。北人所好者曰香片茶。熏以馥烈之味。而茶實粗劣。一紙之裏。售銅元六枚。恰可供一壺之瀹。良爲便利。飯莊茶坐。無不用之。凡南人所至之處。亦備龍井。然無眞龍井。略具其色而已。壇園（中山公園爲舊社稷壇故晚近詩人多壇園）松柏之下。棐几繩床。清陰細草。與兩三素心之侣。盤桓晷移。實北都第一樂事。顧苦無佳茗。有陸羽癖者。能自携茶具。斯爲妙絶耳。大抵北人不擅花乳銅鐺之韻。然選勝則固優爲之。陶然亭茶坐。當秋風起日。亭臯葉落。蒹葭蒼蒼。據一角危闌。送夕陽銜西山。與金闕觚稜相映。此景最勝。游人至此雖欲不駐足流連不得。頤和園宫門前當西苑營房大道。有小茶肆。傍古柳數株。累土爲臺。疊甓爲儿。以葦棚爲蔭。夏日臨流。蟬聲盈耳。偶見鳧鷖浴水。羽毛鮮潔。相逐爲嬉。令人渾忘塵世一切機事。此肆主人爲舊日旗營軍官。斥家爲此。殊見匠心。他處蓋未之見也。天咫偶聞所述蓋即此類。城内諸小茶肆多兼爲說書塲。几案亦殊雅潔。秋宵無事。徐傾一盌。聽負鼓盲翁唱蔡中郎。大足消遣。隆福寺街東口舊以弘碧軒茶館。其門榜弘字末缺筆。尚是乾隆以前之物。民國十三年以後。已不見矣。</p>
<p>庚子以前。茶肆之最巨者推後門外之天匯堂。廣庭巨厦。錦檻明鐙。坐中之客。多爲豪貴。蓋後門一帶多王侯第宅也。其几案茶盞悉爲特製。大踰常品。厮役趨走者數十百輩。各有等威。秩然不紊。庚子被兵。化爲煨燼。今其地猶號天匯大院。自時厥後。亦無此規模宏遠之茶肆矣。</p>
<p>時至今日。國勢阽危。已達極點。國人當抱定鐵血救國主義。鐵者。研求科學之根本。血者。犧牲决死之精神。有鐵而無血。適以造成資醉義的工具。有血而無鐵。徒爲弱小民族之呼聲。必也鐵血并用。用乃能有成。母爲五分鐘之熱度。勿作一時之狂憤。持之以剛毅。守之以有恒。斯深刻而堅貞。（移酬助賑）</p>

<p>美國生理學博士羅威克斯　近在華盛頓半月刋發表「將來之人類」一文。頗有意味。爰譯述之。以供研究。博士之言曰。人類果至何時而滅絶乎。或謂人與地球相終始。將來地球與他星球相撞。地球毁則人類絶跡矣。或謂人類與諸生物。必須賴相當温度以生存。地心之熱。逐漸散失。人類與諸生物自屬同歸於盡。或謂地面空氣。將來日就稀薄。海水蒸發。霪雨若干年。人類淹没無孑遺矣。以上所說。雖根據學理。但均不切於事實。然則將來之人類究如何乎。則予可斷定若干年後。人類必遭一大刦。非大戰禍。即大瘟疫。而付諸淘汰之列。别有一種較優之人類。起而代之。此一種較優之人類。即爲將來之主人翁。蓋人類劣性太重。雖施種種敎育。無能爲力。病源愈多。雖投種種藥石。難以見效。至時則將來之主人翁出矣。將來之主人翁。出於黄白種人中乎。抑棕紅黑種中人乎。尚難預測。總之此主人翁。以精神文明。打倒物質。槍砲子彈無所用。奸詐淫盜無所見。食物絶簡單。壽命約二百歲至五百歲。大同世界。屆時始得實現。地球上滿佈祥瑞之氣。永無毁壞滅絶之憂。幸福正無量也。</p>
<p>短訉　前四年歸國受國人及外人推崇之中國在外三十年之藝術家郎德山君。自離滬後。遍歷大小二十餘國。到處受熱烈之歡迎。藝術與節目均與時俱新。近據郎君致其友人函。云將於日内自紐約啟程來華。一瞻祖國近况云。</p>
<p>聲明「聽拳」我的小小志願是：「兩耳已將清水洗。從今愛聽拳頭聲。」引號裡只有這兩句。從哈字起是要另起一行。</p>

<h3>敲夢的杵（一四）</h3>
<p>— 程瞻廬</p>
<p>陶遲的讀書志趣，益發興奮了！他當然爲着顔如玉而興奮，他尤其爲着足如菱角而興奮！他北上去趕會試的時候，跑的足力困乏了，他便用着昔人慰足詞的論調：丨丨足啊丨丨足啊丨你努力去趕取功名，到那功成名就時，自有三寸弓鞋，夜間伴你。</p>
<p>陶遲聨捷了，陶遲在金殿對策的結果，高中了一甲第三名進士，便是四萬萬同胞人人艶羡的探花郎。</p>
<p>「洞房花燭夜，金榜掛名時；」這是四喜時中的二喜。但是陶遲的喜，還得透進一層；陶遲的洞房花燭夜，娶的是三寸金蓮的百媚娘：陶遲的金榜掛名時，中的是一甲三名的探花郎；這時的陶遲，簡直是天之驕子了。</p>
<p>他朗誦着自己的會試硃卷和殿試對策，覺得天下丨丨丨陶遲目光中的天下其實只是中國丨丨文章，莫大乎是；即此便可以安邦定國而有餘了。</p>
<p>他又撫摩着新夫人的纖纖金蓮，他益發傲睨一切了！他以爲新夫人的一雙三寸不足二寸有餘的纖足，决不是尋常的纖足！只爲社會上對於纖足的批評：！丨蘇州脚，不如揚州脚：揚州脚，不如山西太原脚：山西太原脚，不如山西大同脚。大同婦女的纖足，名滿全國；每逢六月天貺節，照例舉行一年一度晾脚會；這便是大同城廂内外不論大家小户的纖足婦女大比賽。唐秀英没有出閣的時候，也曾在晾脚會中參加比賽而取得大同第一纖足的榮譽；這便值得陶遲誇爲人天希有的幸運和艶福。他以爲娶得天下第一纖足的美人，比着高中探花郎尤其難能而可貴。他以爲天下婦女的脚，都不好算做脚；天下婦女只有一雙脚，便是他夫人這一雙三寸不足二寸有餘的纖纖蓮鈎。</p>

<h3>匯市稍趨緊象</h3>

<h3>大比期紛忙中厘拆和緩狀態</h3>
<p>市塲概况　昨日值十月半之特殊大比期、金融界對於收解手續、以長期歸束關係、自當較平時爲繁、惟市塲中銀洋形勢、似較上日和緩、雖内幕尚未遞鬆、要知能將外表維持現狀、未始非金融界之好氣象、</p>
<p>厘拆價格「洋厘」早市爲七錢二分八厘七毫半、較前日略好半厘、午市同價、形勢雖不見鬆、要亦亦無重大昂象、「銀拆」早市三錢、午市二錢六分、較前日遞鬆不少、劃頭祗有六七分加水、銀行掛牌一錢二分、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋早市爲六錢五分九厘半、午市爲六錢五九厘、交易早市四千角、午市二千五百角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢五分四厘半、午市同價、交易早市十七萬五千角、午市二萬角銅元加長五百文、爲三百七十七千文、交易三萬二千餘串、</p>

<h3>到期長期未能全部處置</h3>
<p>昨日十半大比期、對於上届長期、例應到期處置、而歸束者厥數甚偉、良以商市及時局關係、未能如願了結、會經金融界設法變通、務使兩無妨碍、保全市面之安奠、但查昨日到期照轉者、固屬不少、而不肯賡續放出者、亦不在少、勢必各有爲難情形、祗以時事迫而出此、斷非人力所可挽救、故金融界亦無法處置、據個中消息、大部份欵項遷延未了者正多云、</p>
<p>證劵　債價續趨堅俏</p>
<p>比前日復漲七八角至二元許</p>
<p>現貨漲尤勁成交九百六十萬</p>
<p>昨（十五日）華商證券交易所各債券市况、現貨仍有多種開出、全日共成交二萬七千元、期市稍佳、前市兩盤、頗不寂寞、成交約有七百萬元、後市平靜、計二百六十餘萬、合計九百六十餘萬元、各價以市塲人心仍佳、買進交易活動、故晨初開出時、即一致飛漲、比前日續漲甚鉅、惟自是以後、市塲形勢即轉均衡、市面遂入於混沌狀態、忽漲忽跌、趨勢盤旋、惟未有重大變動、結果僅整六跌六角、其他均續漲、内二○關鹽稅一九關等現貨各漲三元、數爲最鉅、統稅現貨及一九關十月漲一元九角許、其他亦好七八角左右、又金融現貨久無交易、昨價七月下旬除忽跌六元數角、二○捲及關稅十一月則均比上星期回漲頗鉅、觀債價之續漲、實外交形勢良好、惟今後債券市之形勢、依然未易捉摸、將仍視外交前途以轉移云、</p>

<h3>印席棉業週訉</h3>
<p>上週孟買期貨市况　因奥姆辣棉區有雨、無甚變動、棉收遲延、因之損害不大、惟中央省及皮拉爾棉花已受損害、現貨方面、歐洲出口需要靜寂、遠東各國因印棉較美棉略責、問訉絶跡、目下印棉似較比價漲十五羅比、設能回軟、出口間訉仍有希望也、</p>
<p>糧食　窰種百哥各低半元</p>
<p>滬南　昨日各帮來源四十餘艘、河存豐厚、本城店銷因市價廉、交易呆滯、南帮窰種百哥稻白稻三種、各跌半元、早晚稻貨則稍有、客帮不動、致價又短二尺、新蘆洋尖貨雖不多、奈銷不暢、致價逐跌、變陰元無無榮辱、</p>
<p>新閘　昨蘇州河畔到船四五十號、本街胃口寥寥、東西新粳較前略淡、行情各鬆五角、新蘆洋尖受西貢米影響、開盤降縮二角、常錫北破來貨尚多、交易揀頂而動、次色江陰貨所軋、頗爲呆滯、價軟近尺、陰元到銷二平、市無上落、</p>
<h3>洋米進出兩少</h3>
<p>昨日洋米、又見清淡洋行仍無抛售、客帮亦無問訉、本街進胃轉居觀望、市面乃轉入停頓狀態中矣、惟北方各帮、需要甚殷、祗以營口·大連各地、未曾安靖、更爲運輸問題、迄未實行至運、如北帮一有大批去化、市面立可起色、昨日祗有本街應酬中關小絞三百包、回籠小絞三四月期四百噸、行情與前市相似云、</p>
<h3>粉市暫呈盤旋之局</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、致呈盤旋之象、因洋麥報價、小去一角左右、中日國交、尚有一線希望、所以人心漸平、内地帮收進者見稀、惟以市值已低、如無意外衝動、此種市價、暫可站住、但北銷祗天津一處、廠粉再積、本月份或須再見變動也、結果本月份不動、十一月份好五厘、十二及一月份小二厘半、二月份不動、三月份小二厘半云、</p>
<h3>麥價回落四五分</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、仍見不振之象、因國際旣少破裂之象、洋麥定貨、當然可陸續進口、而最近廠家之定貨、到貨甚暢、大小各廠、均不患無生産之恐慌、所以標準局面、又被壓迫、蓋洋麥如不發生問題、仍係過剩、故前途不免重趨暗淡也、結果本月份較前日跌四分、十一月份跌五分、十二月份跌三分、一月份跌二分、二三月份跌四分　　南北貨　新南芡首批已到</p>
<p>行進一百八十元</p>
<p>南塘芡　、昨聞首批新貨業已抵申、初市收價僅一百十元、茲因逐步轉升、現市售盤已達一百八十元、前後相差七十元之多、實以底貨告乏所致、陳貨價亦相仿、池芡大約尚需月餘、方可見新、陳貨存底亦缺、現市行售三十二兩、市象堅穩、</p>
<h3>榨菜到稀市定</h3>
<p>四川榨菜　近來各處銷胃平平、惟到貨漸稀趨勢轉定、查市上存底尚多、客貨開過十九元、現市行盤頂上莊榨菜售二十二元、上中莊二十元、普通貨十八元、最次者不上十七元、</p>
<p>南塘芡萱　市上存底早告斷檔、惟聞某行尚有少數存儲、茲值新陳不接之際、乘勢出售、每担竟達百六十元、誠稀有之高價也、</p>
<p>絲茶　里昂華絲價難立住</p>
<p>滬白廠經又跌二三法郎</p>
<p>里昂市塲　週因日絲廉價侵銷　華絲廠銷益趨疲滯、週一二滬白廠經開價每基羅又各跌二三法郎、計價等價開二百二十一法郎、上等一百六十八法郎、中等一百二十二法郎云、</p>
<h3>歐美絲銷疲滯如故</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊絲市、續呈疲滯、緣海外市塲日絲侵銷不懈、各綢商對於華絲、均嫌價昂、去電不轉、昨祗信孚等進滬白廠經二十包、三星等進黄粗絲十八包、價仍平疲云、</p>
<h3>茶市益趨沉靜</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、益趨沉靜　　珍肩、市面完全停滯、英法行家、均以東省事件嚴重、滬埠抗日益厲、交日郵船載運箱茶、未能裝出、進意益趨清淡、全市除俄國協助會、對於貢熙一項、照常收辦外、餘均寥寥無幾云、</p>
<p>疋頭　國産疋頭走銷甚暢</p>
<p>注意···改裝者復乘時崛起</p>
<p>疋頭市况國貨去路依然有供不應求之勢、連日鴻章廠所出之三羊棉法絨、已銷售一空、價開二錢五分半、達豐之直貢呢現貨仍少、江陰之白坯直貢呢大有隨出隨罄之狀開八兩、上海印染廠所出各貨、亦異常活動本客一致採辦、現貨奇缺、惟際此反日檔口、國貨暢銷之際、將仇貨改裝者、又復發現、就中以細布一項爲最夥、蓋華廠方面此種出口極形稀少、故往時市上祗湖北之萬年青賽馬等重磅貨、本埠出品之汽球金城人鐘等牌外、餘均罕見、日來倐形增多、以天津運來較多、但團體方面已一致認爲國貨、然上海日廠之細布、上週運往天津達三四千件作何去路、不難有識者思索、西貨之尺六元絨由漲轉定、大舞臺爲一兩五錢七分半、船牌一兩四錢半、永樂一兩一錢、定貨交易異常活動、連日成交已千餘件、花布原布直貢呢坯子下週將有大批到市、據云係某染織廠前定之貨云、</p>
<h3>中厚嗶嘰走銷暢達</h3>
<p>昨中厚嗶嘰、走銷甚暢、本街大小各洋服店需要均旺、市氣頗佳、東方三○○八每碼售三兩七錢、三○○一爲二兩七錢半、寳多玄都觀五兩七錢半、寳克二○○爲五兩六錢半、天豐四兩八錢、水　四兩六錢七分五厘、聞日來顧客添製新裝、均購藏青之色、西服帮　胃亦特强云、</p>
<h3>素嗶嘰有轉漲之勢</h3>
<p>元常藍灰雜色素嗶嘰、最近趨勢大佳、其售價大有轉漲之勢、蓋買方需要殷繁、市銷廣暢、兼之日貨封存絶跡、英法德意各行嗶嘰、更形暢銷活躍、元色更爲軋缺俏漲、藏藍次之、灰色略軟、昨日本客帮進胃均健、前可扣佣者現則一律革除、改爲凈盤、不日恐防尚須上漲、</p>
<p>煤灰　北票煤屑來源斷擋</p>
<p>存煤約六萬噸</p>
<p>北票煤肩　近年來滬上銷路頗廣、各大工廠均有採用、去年本埠銷額、達二十萬噸之巨、今年上春、因開平煤礦與北寗路局交涉、開平煤减少來滬時、北票稍路驟增數倍、迺知近來暴日侵佔我東省、致北票運輸被阻、本埠來源遂告斷擋查滬存現貨、不過六萬噸左右、售價每噸現售十兩云、</p>
<p>五金　五金實交蕭索</p>
<p>昨日五金交易、依然簫索、良以時局不靖之故惟廠家點缀、邇來亦覺不多、是以全市殊覺清靜、法西釘昨市開出六七百桶、價八兩五錢半、十六號至二十號新鉛絲昨市由福建帮購去四五百擔、價十六號至二十號每擔十三兩三錢、二十一號至二十五號十八兩七錢半、英鋼板半分花色昨有成交價八兩五錢、厚花色則殊無指染者、行情頗有外强中弱之象、花園鉛絲·新鐵絲等、昨日均有點綴、價五兩、四十八張美白鉛、昨傳新貨將到、故一般採辦者、頗欲收羅也、價大致開十九兩光景、竹節鋼條昨價已跌至八十兩進關、雖同業竭力推銷、但建築帮無敢收辦、此外各鐵貨行情無大出入、而交易亦覺十分寥落云、</p>
<p>雜訉　玻璃二千件比國運來、</p>
<p>人造絲七十六件意國至來、</p>
<p>毛織品疋頭四百六十件英國裝來、</p>
<p>鋼鐵一萬四千二百件比國運申、</p>

<h3>帥頌平槍决</h3>
<p>臨刑前極口呼寃</p>
<p>求法官代追欠欵</p>
<p>通知家屬來收屍</p>
<p>供述後涙下如雨</p>
<p>公平洋行買辦盧少棠、自被綁脫險後、業經捕房拘獲案犯多名、分别懲辦、但此案中之首領江西人帥頌平、現年五十二歲、歷任政界要職亦在天津被捕、由總巡捕房總稽查處華總探長陸連奎·探長劉紹奎·湯堅等、往津將帥迎提來滬、解送第一特區地方法院、迭次研訉、</p>
<p>判决帥處死刑　呈報省政府核准、定於本月十五號執行、昨已屆期、午後二時許、捕房將帥解送第一特院刑三庭、因帥身　囹圄、致面容清瘦、精神萎頓、當由程尚豐推事蒞庭、向帥頌平宣諭、今日爲執行死刑之期、汝有無遺言、據帥稱余對於此案判處死刑</p>
<p>覺得實在寃枉　因盧少棠被綁時、余並不在滬適在天津、但自被捕解滬後、即有僧人寳洪·及張貴祥·王金生等、三人代余運動、延請律師、爲議定運動費洋一萬元、先交三千五百元、後又向各處親友貸得洋一千五百元交給、其結果仍判余死刑、余之律師聲言、代爲請求更審、不料今日已屆執行之期、</p>
<p>此係國家法令　無法可想、惟請庭長作主、代余追回運動費五千元、程推事當宣諭曰、爾之律師代爾撰狀、請求更審、本院亦已接到請求書、但爾所犯之罪、係懲治綁匪法、不能上訴、今爾對於家屬方面、有無遺言、帥續稱、　　余有子名帥雷　現住法租界霞飛路和合坊七十九號胡姓家二層樓上、請代爲通知、並請代書信函兩封、一致南丁公廟六號中華及雪華肥皂廠余弟帥蘭平、囑其將在滬之第三妾及在常州之第五妾並四歲子、均帶回江西撫養、且須將余</p>
<p>遺骸帶回安葬　尚有一信致閘北共和新路南山路口夏倫綢廠友人包金石、因其於民國十八年、曾借去洋二千元、尚有嵩山路錦成里裝電燈之章坤記、欠余七百元、世界書局余有存欵一千六百元及六百元兩項、日夜銀行有存欵二千三百元、尚有駐京辦公處處長胡中青、現住天津日租界日興里六號、亦</p>
<p>欠余洋一萬元　該欵雖無憑證、但自余被捕後、因在在需欵、故曾在獄中修函往索、迄今并無覆音、尚有許照章者、於民國五年間、任大新關時、因交代不清、向余借去洋八千元、以上數項借欵、請求記明、着余子代索、餘無他言云云、程推事准之、遂命帶下、由中西捕押登汽車、連同</p>
<p>全案卷宗照片　、一併解至漕河涇刑場一面通知地方法院委派楊文濬檢察官爲監刑官、即命警長許金清·警目陳錫匯、帶同行刑法警顧漢卿·朱萬沅·薛炳章·張春森·等、分乘汽車馳往刑場、經楊檢察官偕典獄長董長民升座公案、當由法警將帥帶上、帥身</p>
<p>穿灰雨紗長衫　面目清白、文質彬彬、殊不似窮凶極惡之像、時有陸伯鴻爲之付聖水後、法官遂加審問、據帥供年五十十歲、江西人、現在霞飛路和合坊七十九號二樓親戚吳子英家中、我死後、請求寄信到是處、囑來收屍、我今天旣已判死刑執行、别的亦無說不過當盧、</p>
<p>少堂被綁、我在天津、現被仇人所誣扳、我於</p>
<p>廿二歲時出仕　由候補知縣分發到湘南、在軍政界三十餘年、做過大總統國務院中之要缺、在去年被共黨之亂、來滬居住、自己被人恐嚇、豈有做綁匪之事、但我被捕在北京</p>
<p>因有仇人借洋　五百元不遂而報告、在去年我全家被捕、經寳洪和尚·張冠俠·王金生·等經手、用去一萬元、今年又用去三千五百元、要求交他們返還、因爲我長子現在中國公學讀書、將來尚須成家、幼子則今年甫四歲、亦要生活、如果我寃枉他們、</p>
<p>則我子子孫孫　像我槍斃、言畢、涙如雨下、至此、法官遂命執行、由許警長指揮行刑法警、將帥頌平帶下槍决、由宣檢騐員騐明後、諭由堂收騐、候家屬認領、</p>

<p>我是一位小典員、進欵並不豐富、感受了家境的束縛、經濟異常困難、不時閙恐慌、於是養成了貪便宜的習慣、往常所添置的衣服、日用品、只買那價廉的貨、那管他是東洋貨、是西洋貨、現在我覺悟了、覺悟到日本的蠻横强暴、决計不買日貨、但是以前所有的衣服用品、還是日貨居多、依我的心、很願廢棄、但要我一樣一樣的重行置備國貨、我却限於經濟、實在無力再置、若仍穿着用着、自己覺慚愧、有時向人宣傳抵制日貨、却給那人說、「你自己尚且不能抵制、却要規勸别人、」先生、我决不是「冷血動物」、决未、「心死」、我現在要想解决我這樣可以安慰自己内心的不寗、和免去外界的議謗、能規勸别人抵制日貨、請你指示我、最好是在報端答覆、因和我受同樣痛苦的同胞、必定也還有罷、</p>
<p>（覆）舊置的日貨、當然不必廢棄、不過爲勸勉他人］、以身作則起見、能不用最好、你還是就你可以有範圍、表示一下</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<p>新時代月刋丘國基</p>
<p>記得有個作家把自己新出版的一種小說集贈送一本給鄭麗雲、並在封面上寫着「請批評和介紹、」她的答語是、「得了一本書、就要做批評和介紹、未免太不合算吧、」我是没有作家把書本送給我、自然我也没有像麗雲的、「得了一本書、就要做批評和介紹、」認「不合算」的氣勢、我是後期化了一角五分實洋的代價、買、來了一本的新時代月刋、本人爲了特種的研究、數年來對於文藝的作品是全部荒蕪了、對於批評的文字同樣是許久没有摇過筆了、這次却使我愛好文藝的心復熾了、而且再起了爐灶來給新時代月刋以一個批評、</p>
<p>新時代月刋的立塲是什麽、換句話說、它所負的使命是什麽、關於這點我們不可私自懸擬、好在本刋編者曾今可寫在創刋號的卷頭的「隨便說幾句、」已經很直率地說過了、他說、「新時代月刋是一個純文藝的月刋、她没有什麽政治的背景、也不談什麽主義、」換個口吻來說、她是「不談政治、」與「没有主義」的刋物、　　新時代月刋的使命、還負着提拔「無名作家」的一種任務、我們再把本刋編者的「隨便說幾句」看下去、</p>
<p>「編者···盼望「無名作家」們以其心　　血結構的作品投寄本刋、編者是誠意地、謙卑地在等待着我相信一位有名作家拿起筆來隨便爲寫成的東西、不見得一定會比「無名作家」精心構思、審滇作成的作品更好吧、本刋要成爲愛好文藝的朋友們共有的園地、决不會像别的刋物一般非名人的稿件不登、我們願意盡我們所有的力量將富有文藝天才的「無名作家」介紹出來、我們最大的欣幸和光榮是作家的發現、」</p>
<p>這樣看來、新時代月刋的使命、是在提拔無名作家無疑了、本來成名的作家、是經過「無名作家」的階段而來的、無名的作家、如肯努力就可成爲著名的作家的、反過來說、成名的作家、如果不肯繼續努力、也要没落於無名的田地的、</p>
<p>因此我們可以歸納來說、新時代月刋是站在闡發文藝的立塲、而提拔無名作家的、</p>
<p>新時代月刋丨創刋號丨第二期丨丨第三期丨丨按月繼續地出世了、以歷史言、自然未許可說是已經有了悠久的歷史、以本質言、也許未可就稱做個「大塊頭、」然而她能先後不斷地出版到了第三期、也是件難能可貴的事、而且每月能夠按照定期出版、没有像國内其他雜誌月刋常常脫期的毛病、更是一件可以樹國内出版界風氣的事、</p>
<p>現在我們可以檢討最近出版的新時代月刋第三期的内容了、</p>
<p>爲首三篇是帶有論評性質的文字、</p>
<p>（一）華林的懐屈原、（二）毛一波譯的土民藝術論、（三）沈從文的秋之淪落序、這三位作者是被國人推爲旣成的作家、華林更是被推爲老成的作家、</p>
<p>一·懐屈原　是一篇短而精警的文字、作者他認屈原和但丁有許多相同的態度、而與莎士比亞就不同、他的見解是、</p>
<p>「一者從現實中追求理想、一者從理想中追求現實、其實現世界就是地獄、富於熱情的人、每每拿理想美化一切、」</p>
<p>二·土民的藝術論是一篇稍長的譯論、譯者在中國文壇上早有相當的地位、他的譯文是很細膩而忠實、</p>
<p>譯者特選這士民藝術論來譯的意思、我們可以追想譯者是怎樣的痛恨不勞而獲的剖削者、反之、他是怎樣的同情自食其力的勞働者呢、</p>
<p>三·秋之淪落序本來借助名人來裝璜門面的序文、我們可以卑之無甚高論、但沈民這篇序、並不什麽爲作者吹拍、有幾句警語、很可壯壯青年作家的勇氣、</p>
<p>「創作不需要聰明與敏捷、却不可缺少誠虔持久的一點信心、······我們的作品、全是幼稚、那也無防、只有我們的信念可以使作品强壯、」</p>
<p>有志創作的青年們、不要餒志罷、只要努力堅持下去、就會有豐富的收穫的、次之是刋載些譯著的小說、讓我也舉出三篇的代表作來說一說、丨丨</p>
<p>一·巴金譯的母親之死巴金是個　　高雲影女士之棍棒操（冰攝）</p>
<p>旣成的作家、他的譯品、也能做到信、雅、達的境地、母親之死的作者爲赫爾岑、這是一篇描寫輪船沉没的悲慘的小說、我們看、</p>
<p>「我們到了葉耳時已在夜間、我立刻到警察署去、警察署員帶了一個巡官伴着我先到港口官吏那裏去、他那里有各種打撈起來的東西······我們又到醫院去···别的幾個告訴我說、他們看見一個老太太、一個五歲的孩子、一個生着漂亮的鬍鬚的青年···他們和這三個人在一處一直到最後大家失了知覺的時候、這樣看來這三個人也和所有其他的人一樣是沉到海底去了、然而我不禁又生了疑問、這些人又怎會遇救呢、事實上他們和易絲兩主僕一樣、自己完全不清楚是怎樣被救起來的、</p>
<p>打撈起來的死屍是放在一個尼菴的殯葬所裏、我們又從醫院到那里去······在殯葬所放着一排蓋着的匣子、每一隻匣子裏放了一具屍體、警察署員呌人把匣子打開······每個匣子打開時、他便打起官腔問道、「你在我們面前承認這屍體是你所不認識的嗎、」我們又走到第二只匣子那邊去···我找不出一個來···</p>
<p>我的母親、我的柯立亞、我們的好司畢滿就這樣不曾留一點痕跡地消滅了、他們的東西没有一件留下來的、他們的死是無可疑惑的了、</p>
<p>這是一幅怎樣棲慘的圖畫、我以爲這篇極似囂俄所作「海上的悲劇、　　二·曾今可作的生活安定以後作者是擅長於寫言情的小說、在這篇裏又表現他寫言情小說的特長、且看、</p>
<p>「在過去兩年中、曾有一個美麗的少婦與他發生了戀愛、有過實際上的愛的關係、她並且有意要與她的丈夫離婚再來嫁他、另外還有一個可愛的少女熱愛着他、不惜以處女之寳奉獻給他、希望把他以終身、他也很改造自己的家庭、因爲他不缺少這種機會、但他却又不忍把原有的妻子抛棄、情願犧牲自己無窮的幸福、在這一點上、證明他是一個很有道德的青年、」</p>
<p>三·彭成慧的火車軌上的死者這是一篇有事實做背景的小說、這篇的主人翁秀明、就是在滬寗車的眞茹站附近的自殺者曁南同學趙伯順、這篇小說分做前後兩段、前一段我很喜歡看它的得到他的愛人棄他的惡耗、</p>
<p>「他今晨起來接到他的朋友從南島寄來的一封信、報告他說他的愛人已變心而另戀他人了、這樣無端的洪水衝毁了他想越過的幸福的河渠、這樣無端的暴風崩倒他預備攀登的幸福的雲梯、怎樣不使他感到痛心疾首呢、」</p>
<p>後一段我尤愛看他臨去鬼門關的緊張慘狀的描狀、</p>
<p>「他緩緩地到了京滬鐵路的傍邊、坐在近着鐵橋的一塊草地上、他凝望</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>着溪水悠悠地在流、他吃着花生米、他飲着啤酒、這時候一幕幕的往事、又重疊湧上了他凄楚的心頭、滾滾的熱涙、一陣一陣的在他底眼前奔流、</p>
<p>「啊啊、你那巍峨的科學館、你那莊嚴的寄宿舍、你那蒼古的大敎室、你那鬱葱的叢林、别了、别了、</p>
<p>「啊啊、我親愛的同學們、我敬愛的敎師們、還有我母校、我的可愛的小學生、别了、别了、</p>
<p>「啊啊、你曾經愛我而又擯棄了我的雪清啊、我希望你永遠快樂、我敬祝你永遠幸福、我在天堂裏當祈禱上帝、企求上帝、永遠賜給你以光明與美麗、</p>
<p>「啊啊、我那遥隔千里、倚門而望的雙親啊、你底親愛的兒子、要在這月白風清的夜裏踏進另一個美麗的世界去了、你們得到這樣的消息以後儘管可以不必悲哀、儘管可以不必傷心、因爲你們底兒子所踏進的世界是永遠快樂幸福的、我在那裏當没有絲毫的痛苦和煩惱、親愛的雙親啊、我在此祝你門的精神永遠　鑠、你們的玉體永遠健康、</p>
<p>車輪旋轉的隆隆的聲音、已漸漸的明顯了、在他慘白消瘦的臉上、溢出了一副悲慘的微笑、於是他便輕輕地、鎭靜地、安然地横臥在鐵道軌上、</p>
<p>待他正進了另一世界的時候、大地上正顯着魚肚色的微白、」</p>
<p>據作者的聲明、說「此文完全是告Ｅmagination寫的、本來作小說、至少要有此三種要素、第一Ｆact、第二Ｅmagination、第三Ｄescription、我喜歡這篇小說的原故、可以說就是因爲它具備了這三種要素、有些粗製濫造的作家、每每雖然有了第一項要素、然而缺乏第二三兩種要素、」</p>
<p>新時代月刋的内容、再次之是九篇的詩選、我對於流水的「花呀、月呀、愛人呀」的白話、是看了不曉得好壞的、這正是我對於新詩的缺乏Ｓensivility感受性吧、也許是因爲流行的新詩的本身的缺乏内容吧、這裏披集的幾篇詩我却喜歡看、尤其是鄭麗痕的「開拓」、且讓我把它中間的一段介紹出來、</p>
<p>「此刻時丨</p>
<p>戰爭的開始、</p>
<p>殺聲四起了、</p>
<p>朋友、</p>
<p>何容逡巡、遲疑、</p>
<p>快準備好我們的武器、</p>
<p>新時代的偉大的力、</p>
<p>終於鼓舞著我們的前進、</p>
<p>就讓我們從鬥爭中、</p>
<p>體味出生命的意義、」</p>
<p>她雖然還不是一個女詩人、而比較的是一個理論的作家、她這首詩也没有形式與音節的排塲、這也正是它的美罷、我愛看它的原故、還是因爲它的跳躍的Vitality、</p>
<p>此外還有張若谷的谷崎潤一郎的富美子的脚的一篇散文、張氏的文筆簡潔無華、讀者早已有了好的印象、這裏我可不必多推許了、</p>
<p>新時代月刋最後、有文壇消息及讀者的意見的兩個篇幅、我以爲這兩個多餘的尾巴是可不必要的、（日報周刋、可以有此辦法、）因爲像文壇消息的三十二條消息、只是國内作家的起居注、然而作家的行動、是一天一個星期而不同的、而且一個月刋只有三十二條的作家的消息、更是少得可憐、此欄能改登些有意義的世界文壇消息、那就好了</p>
<p>至於讀者的意見、尤其可不必要、因爲讀者各人有各人的個性、各人有各人的環境、同時也就各人有各人的意見、不能盡量他們不同的意見的可能、也不能强人同意一些被發表的讀者的意見、所以我以爲由讀者去自發感想、自生意見、而無發表之必要、</p>
<p>其他的缺點有許多印錯的字、尤其英文錯得一榻糊塗、望下期有以改之、總之、就一般來說、新時代月刋是值得購閱的刋物、</p>

<h3>Yu Zhaolin's Brigade Blocks the Northern Advance of Mongol Troops</h3>
<p>Japan Opposes the US Attending the League of Nations, Japanese Planes Bomb Tongliao Station, Japanese and Korean Instigators Incite Bandits to Disrupt the Dalu Road</p>
<h3>War Breaks Out in Heilongjiang Province</h3>
<p>Yu Zhaolin's Brigade Blows Up the Jiangqiao Bridge, Fierce Fighting with Zhang Haipeng's Army Yesterday, Japanese Planes Reconnoiter Longjiang, Provincial Committee Zhao Zhongren and Others Arrive in Harbin</p>
<p>(Harbin) Zhang Haipeng's army attempted to cross the Jiangqiao Station on the evening of the 14th, but was blocked by Yu Zhaolin's Heilongjiang army brigade and could not advance. On the morning of the 15th, they had not yet occupied Heilongjiang's provincial capital. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to transportation circles, Yu Zhaolin originally ordered the brigade to retreat to Zhaodong, complying with Vice Minister Ping's telegram not to provoke conflict. However, the soldiers were very angry and vowed to fight the traitors, disobeying their superiors' orders, blowing up the Jiangqiao Bridge, and confronting Zhang's troops. Fierce fighting broke out on the morning of the 15th. Zhang's army had more than 17,000 men, with two Japanese planes assisting in the attack. Yu's brigade had only 5,000, but they were all veterans of the Russian defense campaign under Han Guangdi, brave and skilled in combat. Zhang's army failed to cross. Zhang Haipeng is a veteran of the Northeast faction. When Zhang Xueliang took power, he appointed Zou Zuohua as the Xing'an District Commissioner, ranking above Zhang, which Zhang resented. This time, he took advantage of Japanese influence to create chaos. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Two Japanese planes flew from Tongliao to Heilongjiang's provincial capital this afternoon, reconnoitered for half an hour, and left. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Heilongjiang Provincial Committee members Zhao Zhongren and Dou Lianfang arrived in Harbin today from Heilongjiang. It is said that Chairman Wan Fulin resigned because he was assisting with affairs in Pingxiang and sent a telegram to that effect, along with a farewell letter to the elders of the province. At the same time, Zhang Haipeng, incited by the Japanese, coveted the provincial government. The current military forces in Heilongjiang province are several times larger than Zhang's army, but fearing local turmoil, they have peacefully retreated. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the morning of the 15th, Zhang Haipeng led his troops to advance towards Longjiang. A Mongol army brigade, well-equipped with guns and ammunition, caused the Heilongjiang army to retreat northward, with talk of preparing to resist. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Chinese Eastern Railway is still safe. A large number of vehicles are gathered in Manchuria, Suifenhe, and await use. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan's troops have already been dispatched to Heilongjiang. Two regiments of the local reclamation army have been placed under Ma's command. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person received a telegram from Heilongjiang stating that Ma Zhanshan has arrived in Heilongjiang to take charge. Various groups have declared their refusal to allow Zhang Xiantao's troops to enter the area. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Intends to Delay</h3>
<p>Proposes the League of Nations Send a Commission to China for a General Investigation, Resolution Postponed Until Next Spring, Prepares for Direct Negotiations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government is currently considering requesting the League of Nations Council to postpone the resolution on the Liaoning-Jilin incident until next spring. It also wants the League of Nations to send a commission to China for a general investigation, but still cannot agree to interference by a third party. It wants the League of Nations to obtain what it calls a fair report on the history and background of Sino-Japanese relations and then make a resolution based on this report. Therefore, it intends to propose to the Council that it adjourn and discuss the case again next spring. At this time, Japan will prepare to open direct diplomatic negotiations with China to resolve various outstanding issues between the two governments. Yesterday, Japanese Foreign Minister Shidehara discussed the Manchurian issue before representatives of various factions in the House of Peers, saying that Japan cannot withdraw its troops until it obtains a fundamental basis for resolving the current disputes between China and Japan. Japan believes that the League of Nations Council has not received a full report on the various circumstances that have led to the tense relations between China and Japan, and that the representatives in Geneva are inevitably developing unfair impressions after listening to China's various declarations. Therefore, Japan wants the League of Nations to send a commission to China to investigate the general situation, etc. China's reply to Japan's protest against the anti-Japanese movement arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday night, but the Japanese Foreign Ministry has decided to shelve it. (15th Reuter's Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat received news from Tokyo that the Japanese government is considering inviting a League of Nations international commission to China to conduct a general investigation. This has made a deep impression and is seen as the first concrete possibility seen in resolving the Sino-Japanese Manchurian dispute. On the one hand, it is somewhat similar to China's request to send an international investigation commission, and on the other hand, it may not provoke Japan's opposition to interference by third parties. (14th Kuomintang Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After hearing three presentations from the cabinet on the Liaoning-Jilin incident, the Japanese Privy Council decided at today's meeting to support and encourage the cabinet. After the meeting, the Privy Council ministers held another meeting and acknowledged that Prime Minister Wakatsuki's recent visits to various important ministers were to seek the best way to achieve national unity. (15th Kuomintang Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Chinese delegation received a telegram from the government firmly denying the report from Tokyo that the Chinese government was prepared to negotiate directly with the Japanese government if it was certain that the League of Nations would not interfere. This afternoon, Chinese representative Dr. Shih sent five telegrams sent from Nanjing yesterday and today to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, one of which reported that Japanese planes bombed Jinzhou, killing a total of 19 people. Japanese planes also attacked railway hospitals flying the Red Cross flag. Another telegram was a translation of Chairman Chiang's report at the last weekly meeting, which stated that if international law could not be maintained, we would spare no sacrifice to fulfill our responsibilities, etc., and did not advocate war. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Does Not Approve of Inviting the United States to Attend</h3>
<p>Tries Its Best to Avoid External Interference</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry has decided to oppose the presence of a US representative at the League of Nations Administrative Council, and Foreign Minister Shidehara telegraphed this intention to Ambassador Yoshizawa tonight. (15th Reuter's Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, people in the State Department said that if the US representative Gilbert is invited to attend the League of Nations Council, he will only be given the power to formally discuss the Kellogg-Briand Pact and whether it should be applied to the Manchurian case. However, in an informal capacity, he can still speak freely on all League of Nations proposals. In formal discussions, it will only be limited to the aforementioned scope. (14th Kuomintang News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) US Secretary of State Stimson stated today that he has appointed the US Consul General in Geneva, Gilbert, to serve as the US representative to attend the League of Nations Council after being invited. This appointment was decided on Monday, but according to reports from Geneva, Japan may oppose US participation, so Gilbert has not yet attended the League of Nations meeting. Also, Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Rong Kui today denied reports that direct negotiations between China and Japan have begun in Tokyo. (14th Kuomintang News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, people in the League of Nations are paying close attention to whether the United States can attend the discussion, believing that once the United States attends, the greatest cooperation between the countries will be seen, which can set a very important precedent for the future. Therefore, all representatives and League of Nations officials are eagerly awaiting the Japanese government's decision in order to work hard to resolve the Sino-Japanese crisis. As of today, there is reportedly no progress in private talks among the representatives regarding the Manchurian case. (14th Kuomintang News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The President of the Administrative Council, Briand, and other members continued their secret talks this afternoon. It is said that the President is now trying his best to get all the members to agree on inviting a US representative to participate in the Administrative Council's discussion on Sino-Japanese negotiations. However, if one member of the Administrative Council opposes the participation of a representative of a non-League of Nations member country in the Administrative Council based on legal grounds, then the Administrative Council can ignore this opposition. However, it is not known whether the US government is willing to allow its representative to attend under such circumstances. There is much discussion within the League of Nations regarding this matter, and the result is highly anticipated, because this matter will set a precedent for the future. The Japanese delegation stated that Yoshizawa has not yet received formal instructions from Tokyo regarding this matter, and also said that although US observers have attended various committees organized by the League of Nations, there has never been a precedent for a non-League of Nations member country to attend the League of Nations Administrative Council. They are currently carefully reviewing the League of Nations Charter to determine how this matter should be handled in legal terms. It is generally believed that the Japanese government's attitude towards the US representative attending the Administrative Council meeting will depend on a strict interpretation of the League of Nations Charter. The British delegation expressed its opinion tonight that the subsequent wording regarding the US representative attending the Administrative Council must come from the US government. Whether the United States wants its representative to attend the Administrative Council as an advisor must be decided by the US government. The United States has participated in the work of the League of Nations in the committees on illegal drug trafficking and the preparation of the Disarmament Conference, but the problem of inviting the United States to participate in the Administrative Council's discussion is the first time. The United States' informal observer in Geneva, Gilbert, is currently in close contact with his government and has probably discussed this matter with the US government, but has not yet received a reply. Tonight, related parties anticipate that Japan will not reject US participation, and it is also heard that a telegram has arrived here from Washington. It is widely believed that Gilbert can attend the meeting as a US observer. The Administrative Council is expected to hold a public meeting tomorrow. At the same time, everyone's attention is focused on Tokyo and Washington, eager to know their attitude and policy on resolving Sino-Japanese negotiations. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>The London Daily Telegraph editorial this morning hoped that Japan would not oppose the US representative participating in the League of Nations Administrative Council, saying that in this kind of discussion, Japan should theoretically accept a resolution that does not contradict the unanimous approval of other countries. If the Administrative Council believes that what Japan has done exceeds the need to protect its interests in Manchuria, then a country that is loyal to fulfilling its international obligations should not be ashamed to be guided by the public opinion of the world's rulers. If not, and it rejects the proposals of Geneva, it will not only not benefit Japan's inherent moral position, but also harm the League of Nations and force it to carry out its responsibility for world peace. At the same time, the United States, which has a great stake in the Far East issue, will still stand outside the League of Nations. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry's remarks today contained the intention that Japan will reject the proposal for a US representative to participate in the League of Nations Administrative Council. It is said that the United States' participation in the League of Nations' discussions is permanent, and Japan will definitely welcome it, but if participation is limited to the dispute between China and Japan, then this policy seems unfair and unreasonable, and Japan will not be willing to comply. The Foreign Ministry has not yet received Yoshizawa's telegram asking the government for instructions. Japanese opinion is that Japan should deal with the Manchurian situation in the same way that the League of Nations should deal with it, and believes that Japan's reasons are absolutely justified, and that its actions are always governed by a sense of fairness. Therefore, there is no reason to reject the proposal for the United States to participate in the Administrative Council. However, there has never been a precedent for the League of Nations to invite the United States, which is not a member of the League of Nations, to participate in the Administrative Council's discussions. It is unnecessary and unfair to make an exception for the current Far East incident. However, if the United States wants to use this participation as a precedent and participate in future Administrative Council meetings convened due to other world problems, such as the difficulties of Albania, then this exceptional move would be commendable. However, it is not certain whether the United States is willing to get so involved in the League of Nations. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has instructed Yoshizawa, the Japanese representative in Geneva, to try his best to persuade the League of Nations Administrative Council to dismiss the proposal for the United States to participate in the discussion of the Manchurian issue, fearing that if this measure must be implemented, it will have a very unfortunate impact on the Japanese people. Tokyo has only received part of Yoshizawa's telegram regarding this proposal. The Japanese government can only give a definite reply when the full telegram is received. Here, the Japanese opinion is that US Secretary of State Stimson's telegram to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations on October 10, which encouraged the League of Nations to use all its power to adjust Sino-Japanese behavior, is unnecessarily severe, and Tokyo has already formed an unfavorable impression because of this. Therefore, if the United States makes an exception to participate in the Administrative Council's discussion of the Sino-Japanese dispute, it is feared that US-Japanese relations will worsen, because the Japanese will feel that the United States is unfairly pressuring Japan in its negotiations with China. The government's opposition to US participation has three reasons: (1) a matter of principle; (2) to show that Japan does not need a third party to participate in resolving disputes on its own; (3) fearing that the Japanese people will suspect that the United States is interfering in Japanese affairs, leading to anti-American sentiments. Furthermore, nothing is more likely to agitate Japanese public opinion than foreign interference, especially from the United States, because the people will think that foreign forces are suppressing Japan when it is confident that its actions are correct and forcing Japan to do what it does not want to do. Moreover, the army has the sympathy of the people, and the Japanese government is deeply afraid of agitating the people, causing the army to become even more stubborn. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Geneva is now awaiting a reply from Tokyo, but the important people here are still conducting their private talks. However, until Japan decides whether it wants the United States to participate, the actual work of the League of Nations Administrative Council cannot proceed. When Yoshizawa spoke to Briand last night, his attitude regarding US participation was milder than before. This morning, Briand met with British Foreign Secretary Reading and other directors of the Administrative Council and told them about his private talks with Yoshizawa last night. Here, there has been no confirmation that Japan requires the United States to agree to participate in various disputes of the League of Nations in the future before it can agree to its participation in this discussion. The Japanese delegation is also unwilling to say much until instructions arrive from Tokyo. The American side here also does not know that the Japanese side has this opinion, but if Japan's attitude is indeed like this, then it must wait for a statement from the United States, because the State Department will not issue an invitation to the US representative until it formally agrees to its representative participating in the Administrative Council's discussion. Although the Administrative Council has not yet met, the Sino-Japanese incident is still attracting everyone's attention. This can be seen from the peace prayer meetings organized by various church organizations here. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Administrative Council Committee, composed of England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, met at the League of Nations Secretariat this morning to continue studying the main points of the dispute between China and Japan and decided to convene a non-public meeting of the entire Administrative Council at 5:00 p.m. today. It is expected that Japan's reply will arrive at that time. The Spanish representative joined the committee meeting because Spanish Foreign Minister Lerroux was the acting chairman when the Sino-Japanese issue was first raised at the League of Nations. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government decided today not to approve of the United States attending the League of Nations Council as an observer and instructed the Japanese representative Yoshizawa through the Foreign Ministry at 5:00 p.m. not to agree. At the same time, it also instructed the ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, to notify the US government that it is not necessary to send an observer representative to attend the League of Nations Council, because this move not only sets a bad precedent but also puts both the League of Nations and the US government in a difficult position. According to the Japanese political circles, there was initially support for this statement, but it suddenly claimed that the League of Nations was purely considering the Far East issue, and Japan did not see any legitimate reason to invite the United States to attend. As for the warlords, they have always opposed this move. (15th Kuomintang News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) While people in Geneva are waiting for Japan's reply, they are paying close attention to studying the Sino-Japanese dispute. Japanese people have stated that inviting the United States to participate in the meeting in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant may harm the integrity of the Covenant, because inviting the United States to attend the Administrative Council is tantamount to adding a special member who only enjoys rights but does not bear obligations. They also said that if the world thinks that all related countries can participate in the meeting, then Soviet Russia and other countries should also be invited. If it is intended to invoke the Anti-War Treaty, then all countries that have signed the treaty should be invited. Although what the Japanese people said is not without reason, the moderates in the League of Nations replied that Geneva and the United States have been in agreement for a month now, and it has not been heard that Japan has expressed displeasure. The case under discussion has been extremely expanded and is definitely not a dispute over formal issues that can hinder its smooth development. In short, the Sino-Japanese dispute has been submitted to world opinion. If Japan uses procedures as an excuse to hinder the cause of peace, it will bear a very heavy responsibility. Everyone in Geneva says this. (15th Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a dispatch from Geneva, Japan's reply has just been received. The text is very long and lists various reasons to explain why it is inconvenient to approve the Administrative Council's resolution to invite the United States to participate in the meeting. The representatives of England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have already discussed the meaning of Japan's reply and will present the original text when the Administrative Council holds a secret meeting this afternoon. After the secret meeting ends, a public meeting may be held. According to our agency's knowledge, the Administrative Council will maintain its resolution regardless of Japan's opposition. (15th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers are all commenting on the League of Nations Administrative Council's invitation to a US representative to participate in the discussion of the Sino-Japanese dispute. Some say that this move will delay the resolution of the issue, but Briand's diplomatic skills can ultimately find a solution. Some newspapers also say that the Chinese side may not be without fault, but the solution to this problem largely depends on the goodwill posture shown by Japan. Japan is a strong and well-organized country. If it can make this kind of posture, it will definitely increase its prestige. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations May Not Achieve Great Success</h3>
<p>Senator Borah's Remarks</p>
<p>New York Senator Borah, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told a guest today that he believes that the League of Nations' efforts to resolve the Far East dispute may not achieve great success and that the United States will not be drawn into this matter to any great extent. Peace will probably be achieved through contact between the authorities of Japan and representatives of other countries. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York US Senator Borah, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated today that he believes that the Washington Nine-Power Treaty can prove its value in the current Sino-Japanese Manchurian dispute and believes that the United States can avoid being greatly drawn into the vortex. He has his own opinions on how to deal with the situation, but he does not want to comment on the actions of the US government and does not want to express his views on restoring peace between China and Japan for the time being.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Note on Yoshizawa's Address</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Administrative Council continued its meeting on the 13th. The chief Japanese delegate, Yoshizawa, delivered a very lengthy address concerning responsibility for the current atrocities and how to respect the League of Nations Covenant, as well as resolving the current world crisis. He offered not a single concrete or precise statement, but rather raised broad, irrelevant issues beyond the present facts, using them as evasions. All nations of the world, and especially our own, should recognize this kind of evasion by the Japanese representative as an extremely malicious diplomatic tactic. Within his seemingly vague and impractical address lies immense purpose, and what he meticulously stated is precisely what Japanese warlords and politicians have been proclaiming for years.</p>
<p>To summarize the important points of Yoshizawa's address: First, to recognize that Japan and our Three Northeastern Provinces have a legitimate special relationship due to the two wars they have experienced. Second, to recognize that our Three Northeastern Provinces are essential for Japan's survival, and Japan should have special economic and political rights there. Third, to recognize that the development of our Northeast is solely due to the efforts of the Japanese, and to declare that Japan has no ambition to seize land in our Northeast and absolutely welcomes all countries to invest in the Northeast, implementing the principle of equal opportunity. Fourth, to recognize that Japan cannot withdraw its troops because the current agitated state of the Chinese people is sufficient to endanger the safety of Japanese residents, deeply concerning world security. Raising these points in a grand assembly where politicians and diplomats from various countries are gathered is far-sighted. It is not merely focused on the debate of right and wrong in the current issue.</p>
<p>Yoshizawa's address is tantamount to stating that our Three Northeastern Provinces are war spoils from the two Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, and enjoying special interests is only natural. Secondly, Japan is small, densely populated, and lacks resources, so seeking survival and a way out in our Northeast is permissible by humanity and inevitable by facts. The development of our Northeast is due to the efforts of the Japanese, and our people have not participated. Using this specious reasoning to seek understanding from countries around the world silences their voices. Furthermore, by expressing that the Japanese have no ambition to monopolize our Northeast, and that the opportunity for development should be shared with the world, the Japanese are subtly appealing to countries around the world, hoping for mutual understanding. In particular, the United States, based on its advocacy of equal opportunity, cannot voice any further objections. Even more, he not only attempts to ease the atmosphere of intervention by countries around the world, but also wants to use the power of the League of Nations to suppress our people's anti-Japanese boycott movement. His diplomatic tactics are as complex and strategic as this.</p>
<p>The reasons that Yoshizawa declared, seemingly correct but actually false, resonate with the propaganda that the warlords and politicians of his country have always promoted, speaking with one voice. We have repeatedly refuted their absurdity, and there is no need to argue further now. What we want to say now is that countries around the world should pay attention to the current issue, not as a simple issue of rights and interests, but as a complete issue related to world security. Japan is destroying the integrity of China's territorial and political sovereignty, placing the Chinese nation on the line of survival and giving it a serious threat. If the international community does not uphold justice and maintain peace, then China is truly cornered and cannot avoid it. It can only exhaust all efforts to deal with Japan. What major impact will this have on the world? Anyone can imagine. Therefore, the current issue can only be resolved by suppressing Japan's atrocities and dismantling its arms that threaten the life of our nation. Otherwise, there is no way to eliminate the current crisis that is about to erupt. Countries around the world should pay attention to the current unbearable and agitated national sentiment in China and not be swayed by the Japanese's sophistry and sweet talk of equal opportunity.</p>
<p>As for our entire nation, we must recognize the maliciousness of the Japanese diplomatic tactics. The negotiations at the League of Nations Administrative Council are in fact our last defense in the international community to fight for justice. What the future holds is difficult to predict. Our government should know how to work hard, how to respond, and how to fight. Our entire nation should especially not harbor the mentality of relying on others for help and should immediately make necessary preparations for any eventuality.</p>

Large businesses have closed down due to lack of trade. Banditry is still rampant at night, causing great panic.

If this situation persists for a month, there will be changes, and this point is worth noting. (4) The Huanggu Village platform and the stationmaster's office are guarded and monitored by Japanese troops. Railway affairs are still managed by the British man S.D. Lee.

<h3>Shih Chao-chi Meets with Briand</h3>
<p>Shidehara Speaks to Chiang Tso-pin</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, Shih Chao-chi visited Briand and held talks. No one else was present. Briand said that according to some sources, China and Japan seem to have directly negotiated. Dr. Shih replied that China's views are as announced in yesterday's public meeting and have not changed. China has no flaws. The responsibility for the Sino-Japanese dispute lies with Japan. Japanese troops should withdraw, and China's damages should be compensated. The League of Nations should recognize all of this. Briand generally inquired about Sino-Japanese relations and inquired about the Sino-Japanese unresolved issues. Finally, Briand reiterated his previous proposal, saying that all issues should be handled separately, and matters outside of the incidents after September 18 should not be mentioned at this time. Dr. Shih also stated that China's intention is only to resolve the current dispute and that China completely trusts that the League of Nations will uphold justice. It is willing to recognize any fair solution unanimously deemed fair by the entire Executive Yuan. He also said that China does not take advantage of the current situation to make a general settlement with Japan and does not want to infringe on the rights that Japan can enjoy under the treaties before September 18. People generally feel that Briand's ability to quell things will be successful. Briand's intention is that the Sino-Japanese dispute must be resolved peacefully and in detail. If an agreement is concluded on the details, it will help clarify the air, as the overall policy is another issue after the Executive Yuan invites the United States to participate in the discussion. According to people in charge of issuing the message, the situation of the conversation between the Chinese ambassador to Japan and Foreign Minister Shidehara is as follows: Shidehara declared that before the withdrawal of troops, Japan wanted to establish a basis for a future agreement between the two countries. Chiang Tso-pin asked to explain his remarks. Shidehara replied that if the Nanjing government did not give its approval in principle for this procedure, he could not say much. According to a telegram from Soviet Russia to Geneva, Japan demanded: (1) China acknowledge responsibility for the September 18 incident. (2) Acknowledge Japan's special interests in Manchuria and change railway policies so as not to compete with the South Manchuria Railway. (3) Acknowledge the rights of Japanese to lease land and businesses. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Chen Youren Cables the League of Nations Administrative Council</h3>
<p>Japanese Demand to Stop the Anti-Japanese Movement</p>
<p>Abolish Violence and Replace it with New Policies</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Youren cabled the League of Nations Council, saying that the League of Nations believed that Japan had a government capable of making the military absolutely obedient, which was a great mistake. In order to make the League of Nations' request for their troop withdrawal impossible to realize, the Japanese military instigated the independence of the Eastern Provinces and openly submitted an ultimatum-like protest to the Ning government, attempting to use these two things to make things difficult for the League of Nations. As for the Chinese anti-Japanese movement, it was caused by Japanese atrocities and is also a natural mobilization of the moral power of the national race against foreign aggression. No government can suppress it. Japan wants to stop the anti-Japanese movement, but it can only seek it from itself, abolish its violence, and replace it with new policies. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Chen Youren yesterday sent a telegram to the League of Nations Administrative Council, stating that the League of Nations Administrative Council already knew the truth of the situation arising from the military actions taken by the Japanese army in Manchuria. The League of Nations seemed to think that Japan had a government that obeyed the military, but this was not the case. This time, the Japanese army, in order to destroy the League of Nations' request to withdraw the troops attacking Manchuria, attempted to confront the League of Nations Administrative Council. (1) Incite the so-called Manchurian independence movement to create a new situation in Manchuria. (2) Expand the dispute by taking the anti-Japanese movement in China. The Japanese government, under the influence of the military, sent a modified ultimatum to the Nanjing authorities on October 10, China's National Day. The document was not only absurd in its wording, but also ignorant of the historical facts of the current Far East, and it pointed out that the anti-Japanese movement in China was a tool of the national policy under the guidance of the Kuomintang. In fact, the Japanese should ask themselves why this movement will be maintained for so long by the repeated insults and unrestrained acts of aggression that their soldiers have inflicted on China. For this reason, the Chinese government is not in a position to suppress it as requested in the Japanese note. This movement is indeed an expression of the emotions of the Chinese people and a natural combination of spiritual strength to resist unprecedented foreign aggression. Only by stopping the violence in Manchuria by Japan can it be terminated. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

When the Japanese army occupied Changchun, they bought off the bandit leader Xiaobailong to help him riot and issued 4,000 rifles and 300,000 Japanese gold to instigate the bandit to riot. Unexpectedly, after Xiaobailong obtained the weapons and money, his policy suddenly changed and he vowed to fight Japan. It is reported that he has captured Qianjin Peak and is said to be attacking Nanman Station.

<h3>Coup in Spain</h3>
<p>Due to the issue of separation of church and state</p>
<p>Prime Minister Zamora Resigns</p>
<p>Azaña Forms New Cabinet</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 10th - Spanish Prime Minister Zamora, a devout Catholic, has resigned because the Congress has decided to separate church and state, expel Jesuit monks, and confiscate their property. The Minister of the Interior has also resigned for the same reason, but the entire cabinet has not been dissolved. Another telegram states that a new cabinet has been formed, with Azaña as Prime Minister and Minister of the Army, and Quiroga as Minister of the Interior. There are no other changes. Internal strife in Spain may accelerate as a result. Unemployment is very high. Fifty-two Catholic Congressmen have withdrawn from Congress. This situation will make things difficult for the government. Furthermore, Azaña's appointment as Prime Minister is not necessarily a good choice, as he had feuded with the military when he was Minister of the Army. It is expected that Jesuit monks will resist the confiscation of their property with force.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 15th - All party headquarters are now handling election work. Tomorrow is the date for the publication of the list of candidates.

If the Conservative and Liberal parties do not reach an agreement, the Labour Party will benefit in the Darwen constituency. The Trade Union Congress published an article yesterday to advocate for the Labour Party, saying that the first Labour government was broken by the Zinoviev Red Letter forgery, and the second Labour government was destroyed by bankers' orders.</p>

<p>New York Telegram - To all compatriots across the country, the Japanese bandits are invading, and the country is on the verge of collapse. Please unite and arm yourselves, prepare for a final battle to the death with the Japanese bandits, and urge the authorities in Nanjing and Guangzhou to work together to resist the invaders. We are determined to follow you all and jointly face the national crisis. Respectfully, the entire Qiongya Association in New York.</p>
<p>Shaowu Telegram - To the Shenbao Newspaper, please forward to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and all Yuan, Departments, Groups, Institutions, and Organizations. Japan disregards our sovereignty, invades and occupies our Northeast, and its tyranny is unparalleled. Upon hearing the news, the faculty and students of our school were filled with righteous indignation and their hearts were broken. We have endured and waited for a resolution by appealing to the League of Nations. Today, there is no hope for peace, and war is imminent. All who have blood in their veins are eager to die on the battlefield to repay the country. Although our school is located in the remote northern part of Fujian, how can we dare to lag behind others in the cause of saving the country? We are now actively engaged in military training and vow to face the national crisis. This is our sincere intention. We respectfully send this telegram first, hoping for your attention. Respectfully, Shaowu Middle School of Fujian Province.</p>
<p>Xiamen Telegram - To the Shenbao Newspaper, please forward to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and to Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, Mr. Hu Zhan Tang, and Mr. Wang Jingwei. The flames of the enemy are raging, trapping our Liaoning and Jilin. Enduring grief, the country is on the verge of destruction. We weep and beg you to awaken your conscience, immediately resolve internal disputes, determine a grand strategy, and quickly prepare for war. In the past, the Song Dynasty's negotiations were unresolved, and the Jin people crossed the river. The southern capital and the Guigong were threatened, and the northern soldiers camped at Guabu. The lessons of the past are not far away and should be a cause for concern. Stop fighting among yourselves, which is akin to suicide, and be firm as if awaiting destruction. Transform the anger of private fights into the courage of public battles. Victory or defeat is difficult to predict, but if justice is slightly extended and national sovereignty is not lost, then the descendants of the Yellow Emperor will not be completely extinct, and the great shame and humiliation will certainly be avenged one day. After careful consideration, we believe that only the officials of our party and country can lead the people, with painful determination, to bear this heavy responsibility. The faculty and students of all schools vow to be loyal to the death, without hesitation. We urgently submit these words, awaiting orders. Respectfully, Jinjiang Rural Normal School of Fujian, Jinjiang Middle School, Quanzhou Middle School, Zhaozhao Vocational College, Peiyuan Middle School, Peiying Girls' Middle School, Yangzheng Middle School, Xiyu Normal School, Nanhua Girls' Middle School, Huiming Middle School, and Pingmin Middle School.</p>

<p>Xi Qia Subsidizes Japanese Military Expenses by 200,000 Yen per Month</p>
<p>Jilin Communication: Mr. Zhang Zuoxiang, Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government, recently sent a telegram to Jilin, instructing all institutions that all orders from Xi Qia, the head of Jilin province, are completely invalid until the overall situation is determined. It is reported that the Jilin Provincial Government will move to Harbin to conduct business. Rong Hou, the dismissed Director of Finance, left for Harbin the day before yesterday (whether this is related is yet to be confirmed). Other dismissed personnel are also preparing to leave the province.</p>
<p>Since Xi Qia assumed the false position of provincial head, all town defense envoys in the province were changed to garrison commanders by Xi Qia, and the independent army brigades were renamed garrison brigades. The position of garrison commander of the provincial capital and commander of the 1st garrison brigade, Xi Qia has appointed Li Guilin, the former Jichang town defense envoy. The original 25th brigade was reorganized into the 1st garrison brigade. Zhang Zuozhou, the original brigade commander of the brigade, is from the same clan as Zhang Zuoxiang. He did not accept Xi's false order and is still stationed in the Yushu County, refusing to hand over his command. Yesterday, Xi Qia specially sent a letter to persuade him, with extremely shameless words, vaguely saying, "Our neighbor's actions are intended to exclude Deputy Commander Zhang and Marshal Fu (Zuoxiang). Since you, brother, are from the same clan as Marshal Fu, it is appropriate to temporarily relinquish your responsibilities. But I heard that you, brother, are plotting resistance in Yushu. What time is it now? You should know that I am in this position today, not seeking the understanding of the people, but seeking to benefit the people of Jilin." He is willing to be a Japanese dog, which can be said to be completely heartless. It is reported that there are currently 2 million yen in Japanese banknotes and 3 million yuan in banknotes stored in the Yongheng Official Bank's vault. This time, Liu Yifen is the general manager of the bank. The Japanese army is using his pro-Japanese sentiments to facilitate the extraction, which is their intention. Currently, Xi (Qia) and Liu, in addition to using 500,000 Jilin yuan to comfort the Japanese army, have also agreed to subsidize the Japanese military expenses by 200,000 yen per month. Recently, the value of Jilin yuan has plummeted, from 70 cents of silver per yuan to 50 cents. The actual value of official notes is even lower, with one silver yuan being worth more than 500 strings of cash. The reason for this is precisely this.</p>
<p>This time, the newly appointed heads of various institutions were mostly forced to accept their appointments due to the great pressure from the Japanese army. For example, Sun Qichang, the Director of Finance, gave a speech to the staff after taking office, saying that the director system is only temporary. Chairman Zhang Zuoxiang will soon return to Jilin to preside over military and political affairs, and the various departments should also return to the old system. Therefore, all the staff of the department, except for one or two who resigned for other reasons, will remain unchanged. Li Xi'en of the Department of Education reluctantly took office after firmly declining. The internal personnel will also not be changed. Cheng Yun, the President of the High Court, is a close relative of Xi Qia but strongly opposes Xi's compromising and humiliating the country. After the announcement of his new position, he fled far to Liaoning Province. However, Liu Yifen, the General Manager of the Official Bank, believes that this is an opportunity to make a fortune. After taking office, he changed more than 50 staff members.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is National Day, although there will be a holiday, flying the national flag is not allowed. Alas, the people of Jilin are, in fact, a people of a lost country. (Evening of October 9th)</p>
<h3>Words of a True Japanese</h3>
<p>Hear this, Japanese Government and Military!</p>
<p>Hear this, Chinese Government and People!</p>
<p>Hear this, Representatives of the League of Nations!</p>
<p>After Japan violently occupied our Eastern Provinces, the Japanese Tokyo Imperial University Newspaper (Issue No. 400, published on October 5th) contained an article by Professor Kisaburo Yokota entitled "The Manchurian Incident and the League of Nations." With the perspective and attitude of a legal scholar, he frankly expressed his views on the matter, aiming to correct the missteps of his government. The following are some of the most noteworthy points in the article: (1) Even if the railway sabotage were a fact, the occupation should have been limited to the Beidaying barracks at most, which could still be strongly claimed as an act of self-defense. Subsequent actions were entirely outside the scope of self-defense. (2) Japan should not use the lack of guaranteed security as an excuse to violate its commitments and not withdraw its troops. (3) The Japanese government bears significant responsibility, both externally and internally, for opposing the League of Nations' joint investigation and the dispatch of observers. (4) Japan should withdraw its troops first and then negotiate. The so-called Manchurian-Mongolian pending issues cannot be a condition for troop withdrawal. If the negotiations between the two countries cannot be resolved, then according to Articles 12 and 15 of the Covenant, it should become a matter for the League of Nations. (5) If China brings the aforementioned issues to the League of Nations and Japan forcefully avoids them, it would be tantamount to admitting the impropriety of its demands. (6) If the two countries cannot peacefully resolve the issue through bilateral negotiations and Japan resorts to force again, there is no room for justification, and it would violate the Covenant of the League of Nations. All of the above points can serve as a valuable resource for our country to speak at the League of Nations. After this article was published, the bombing of Jinzhou and Japan's tyrannical lawlessness were even beyond Mr. Yokota's expectations. Yet, when the peace talks resumed, the Japanese representatives stubbornly insisted that they would not withdraw their troops without security guarantees. Their stubbornness is such that they cannot face the world, nor can they face their own people. The representatives of the League of Nations are all prominent figures in the diplomacy of their respective countries. If they can be impartial and just, and maintain a sense of fairness, they will naturally judge according to the law and speak out for justice, at the very least not falling short of Mr. Yokota's standards. As for our country's stance on this matter, we are justified and should insist on it to the end, without entering into a treaty of surrender. Otherwise, how few will not be laughed at by Mr. Yokota and the Japanese people! Now, I translate the original text as follows. By Xin Nan.</p>
<p>The Manchurian Incident and the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Written by Kisaburo Yokota, Professor of Law and Doctor of Laws at Tokyo Imperial University, translated by Zheng Xin Nan)</p>
<p>1. It is reported that due to the incident of a few meters of railway being sabotaged, almost all the key areas of Southern Manchuria were occupied by Japanese troops. Furthermore, based on the unilateral decision of the military, troops were dispatched from Korea across the border, and the incident escalated to the point where it triggered a warning from the League of Nations to withdraw troops. As a result, the military was startled and issued an informal statement that the matter was not within the scope of the League of Nations' concern or decisively rejected any third-party interference. However, is the League of Nations' advice an act of overreach? Is it an inappropriate interference by a third party? Please, without adopting a self-serving position, examine this issue with the fair and impartial attitude of a scholar.</p>
<p>2. According to Article 11 of the Covenant, the League of Nations' advice to prevent the expansion of the incident and the withdrawal of troops requires prior discussion on whether the advice based on Article 11 of the Covenant is appropriate or not. This article stipulates that whenever there is war or a threat of war, the League of Nations shall take appropriate and effective measures to safeguard international peace.</p>
<p>The current Manchurian Incident is not a war, but there is undoubtedly a threat of war. Originally, Japan had no intention of waging war. At least the general public had no such intention whatsoever. However, wars do not necessarily arise from an initial intention to wage war. There are also many cases where wars are triggered unknowingly by clashes between frontline troops. Moreover, this kind of clash is particularly likely to occur in incidents such as the Manchurian Incident, when the troops of one country are dispatched into the territory of another country. Therefore, the current Manchurian Incident is perfectly suited to the situation described in the article as a threat of war.</p>
<p>As a result, the League of Nations' advice based on Article 11 of the Covenant cannot be said to be inappropriate. However, is the content of the League of Nations' advice justified? As mentioned earlier, the Covenant stipulates that appropriate and effective measures should be taken to safeguard international peace. From the perspective of preventing the expansion of the incident, which is the first point of the advice, we cannot but recognize that this advice is entirely justified. The military claims that all its initial actions were unavoidable acts of self-defense. However, viewed strictly and impartially, can all the military's actions be explained by the right of self-defense?</p>
<p>If the sabotage of the railway is considered a fact, then counterattacking the troops that are sabotaging it is indeed an exercise of the right of self-defense. Or, going further, pursuing these troops and occupying the Beidaying barracks can also be said to be an exercise of the right of self-defense. However, can attacking the Beidaying barracks and almost simultaneously launching an attack on Liaoning City also be said to be an unavoidable act of self-defense? Moreover, in just six hours or so after the clash due to the railway sabotage (10:30 PM on the 18th), Changchun, located 400 li north, was occupied (4:40 AM on the 19th), and Yingkou, located 200 li south, was also occupied (5:00 AM on the same day). Can these also be said to be unavoidable acts of self-defense? Furthermore, it should be particularly noted that the occupation of these places was carried out with almost no resistance. Going a step further, on the 21st, citing the dangerous situation in Jilin and Harbin, the military unilaterally dispatched troops from Korea across the border. On the evening of that day, it was reported that "Japanese troops had captured Jilin in one fell swoop, and the Jilin army had no intention of fighting" (Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, 22nd). Moreover, it was rumored that during the cabinet meeting on that day, the Minister of the Army requested the dispatch of troops, but the Minister of Foreign Affairs opposed it, and no decision was reached in the end.</p>
<p>According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs' view, the degree of danger was not so imminent as to require such action. In fact, considering that Jilin was occupied without resistance, it cannot be said that the Minister of Foreign Affairs' assessment was correct. From this perspective, while the initial clash and the occupation of Beidaying can be said to be acts of self-defense, can subsequent actions all be considered based on the right of self-defense, or not? This is a question that should be thoroughly studied. Under these circumstances, the League of Nations' advice due to the expansion of the incident cannot but be considered an extremely appropriate measure.</p>
<p>The second point of the advice is the withdrawal of troops, which is also a matter of course. When regular troops are facing each other and there is a danger of conflict, the most appropriate and effective measure to ensure peace is undoubtedly the withdrawal of troops. In the current Manchurian Incident, Japanese troops have advanced beyond the railway-affiliated areas where they have the right to station troops and have been dispatched from Korea across the border. Therefore, it is a matter of course to withdraw these troops first in order to ensure peace. It cannot but be considered a natural measure.</p>
<p>In summary, the League of Nations' advice, both in terms of the basis of the advice and the content of the advice, is entirely justified and is by no means an act of overreach or an inappropriate interference.</p>
<p>3. Japan's acceptance of the League of Nations' advice, in form, seems to have declared that it has automatically taken the same measures as the advice. In any case, because the League of Nations' advice is a justified action, Japan's acceptance is a matter of course. The remaining problem is its implementation. Needless to say, it must be implemented in a fair, just, and faithful manner.</p>
<p>With regard to the first point of the advice, it is almost a non-issue. I expect that the incident will not expand further than this. What is becoming a problem now is the second point. It is rumored that the military initially wanted to seize this opportunity to force a resolution to all the pending issues concerning Manchuria and Mongolia at once, and insisted that it would not withdraw its troops until its demands were met. The Minister of Foreign Affairs eventually agreed. However, after receiving the advice from the League of Nations, the government has stated that it is prepared to withdraw its troops from outside the affiliated areas to within the affiliated areas. Moreover, recently, without making the success or even the commencement of diplomatic negotiations a condition, it has stated to the League of Nations that it will withdraw its troops as soon as it is assured of security. This is, of course, the proper course of action. If the dispatch of troops was solely for self-defense, then as soon as the imminent danger is gone, they should withdraw immediately. If they raise issues that are not directly related to this and insist that they will not withdraw their troops until their demands are met, then whether the dispatch of troops was solely for self-defense will only give rise to suspicion. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs suppressed the rumored claims of the military and, regardless of the success or commencement of diplomatic negotiations, independently promised the League of Nations that it would withdraw its troops. While this is a matter of course, it is also commendable.</p>
<p>The remaining problem now is that this promise should be implemented faithfully. It must not be used as an excuse to violate the covenant on the grounds that security guarantees have not been obtained. In particular, opposing the joint investigation and the dispatch of observers by the League of Nations carries a greater responsibility for Japan. In any case, the covenant must be fulfilled in a fair and just manner. Moreover, this is not only an external responsibility to the League of Nations and the United States, but also, and primarily, an internal responsibility to the people, a significant responsibility to the general public who only believe that the troops are being dispatched for self-defense.</p>
<p>4. The relationship with the League of Nations has not yet come to a complete end with this incident. There are things that must not be ignored. Although the threat of war has gone, as far as Article 11 of the Covenant is concerned, the relationship with the League of Nations has already come to an end. However, the negotiations regarding the resolution of the incident are just beginning from now on. There are still the so-called pending issues of Manchuria and Mongolia. As mentioned earlier, it is clearly inappropriate to make these a condition for troop withdrawal. However, after the withdrawal of troops, diplomatic negotiations on these issues will naturally begin sooner or later. If this matter can be resolved through bilateral negotiations, there will be no problem. If it still cannot be resolved, then according to Articles 12 and 15 of the Covenant, it can also become a problem for the League of Nations.</p>
<p>If China brings this issue to the League of Nations, Japan should naturally respond to it. If Japan does not want to use force as a backdrop to forcibly impose its improper demands, it should present its case to the League of Nations and make its case in a dignified manner. If it forcefully avoids it, it would be tantamount to admitting the impropriety of its demands.</p>
<p>We are not opposed to bilateral negotiations from the outset. We are only speaking in terms of the possibility that it may not be possible to resolve it peacefully. If military force is used again at this time, there will be no room for justification under any circumstances, and it will be a clear violation of the Covenant of the League of Nations. We cannot say that there is no possibility of this happening, so we must be careful beforehand.</p>
<p>In summary, while we cannot know for certain whether it is the effect of the League of Nations' advice or the automatic restraint of the diplomatic authorities, fortunately, military actions were prevented midway and did not expand. However, the incident has not yet been resolved. The first is the issue of troop withdrawal, and the second is the issue of diplomatic negotiations. With regard to the former, we must monitor the government to ensure that it faithfully adheres to the covenant and implements the troop withdrawal. With regard to the latter, we must monitor it to ensure that it only uses peaceful means to advocate for justified demands. (October 15)</p>
<h3>Anti-Chinese Sentiment in Japan Worsens</h3>
<p>Reports of Atrocities Against Overseas Chinese Increase Daily</p>
<p>Osaka Correspondence: Recently, the anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan's mainland has been worsening. This is likely Japan's way of retaliating against our country's anti-Japanese sentiment. However, its methods are vicious, with the sole purpose of killing and expelling overseas Chinese. Our country's anti-Japanese movement only involves inspecting Japanese goods. There is no infringement on the lives and property of Japanese residents. However, the anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan's mainland is actually carried out with knives, slaughtering Chinese people almost like chickens and dogs. Reports of overseas Chinese being killed in Tokyo, Osaka, Wakayama, and other places are increasing daily. On the afternoon of the 9th of this month, another Chinese person was killed in Kyoto Park. After investigation, it was discovered that he was a waiter from a nearby Chinese restaurant named Jiang Jin Sheng. After his death, the Japanese authorities cremated the body without waiting for the consent of his relatives, in order to destroy our side's evidence for negotiations. Furthermore, the Tencho Maru, which recently arrived in Kobe, Japan, from Shanghai, was a special ship carrying Japanese consolation goods rejected by our country. One of the Chinese sailors on board, Tang A Gui, was</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>reported by the captain to have committed suicide by jumping into the sea en route. However, according to investigations, he was indeed murdered by the Japanese on the ship, and his body was thrown into the sea. Recently, the Japanese have openly condoned Koreans in various places to loot the property of overseas Chinese, or the Japanese disguise themselves as Koreans and attack overseas Chinese. Therefore, the 20,000 overseas Chinese in the Three Islands are all living in anxiety. Hundreds are returning to their country every day. Almost all the students studying in Tokyo have left. All have withdrawn from Wakayama. Two-thirds have left Kyoto and Osaka. Half have left or are staying in Kobe and Yokohama. The intensity of this anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan is so severe that the situation is no less serious than the Korean Massacre. (October 10)</p>

<h3>Japanese Warships Come to Qingdao to Demonstrate Power</h3>
<p>Pretending to be Autumn Inspections</p>
<p>US Submarines Leave Qingdao to Avoid Suspicion</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since the Liaoning Incident, Japanese fleets have repeatedly taken demonstrative actions in various places along the Chinese coast and rivers. Qingdao, due to its special relationship, has been even more noticed by the Japanese, who have long wanted to take the opportunity to occupy it and fulfill their ambitions of aggression. However, because there is no justifiable reason to do so, it is inconvenient to launch an attack. Furthermore, there are many foreign fleets stationed in Qingdao, and they are also afraid that once they launch an attack, it will arouse the resentment of various countries. Therefore, the city has been at peace. Unexpectedly, in recent days, rumors have been circulating, spreading that Japan will send a large number of fleets to Qingdao, and there is even talk of landing on the 13th. As a result, people are panicked, and the market is extremely unstable. By 8:00 AM this (12th) morning, the destroyers Kariy, Asagao, and Fuyo of the Japanese 2nd Overseas Fleet entered the port and, together with the flagship Kuma, which arrived in Qingdao the day before, were moored in front of the sea in a straight line. At 9:30 AM, nine US submarines left Qingdao for other places, and people became even more shaken. There were also rumors that Japanese naval soldiers would march in the city on the 13th to demonstrate their power. Making mountains out of molehills, the rumors became even more rampant. However, according to Fujiwara, a military attaché stationed at the Japanese Consulate, the fleet has an annual autumn inspection as a precedent. This year, because the flagship Kuma is in Qingdao, the inspection will be held in Qingdao. It has been decided that the inspection will be held on the 14th, with rest on the 15th. The fleet will leave Qingdao for Lushun on the evening of the 15th or the morning of the 16th. This matter has been contacted with the Northeast Naval Headquarters in advance. Even if soldiers happen to land, they are only going to visit the Japanese Chūkonhi monument and have no other intentions, he said.</p>
<p>Shandong has been suffering from years of drought, and hundreds of thousands of people from various places go to the three northeastern provinces to make a living every year. Now that the northeast is occupied by the violent Japanese, the lives and property of the people there have lost their security. As a result, the Shandong people living in the northeast are striving to escape from the tiger's mouth and return to their homeland. Therefore, the ships coming to Qingdao from Dalian in recent days are all loaded with these refugees. When the Fengtian Maru arrived in Qingdao yesterday, it carried more than 1,500 people, most of whom took the Jiaoji Railway to return to their hometowns. Therefore, the train heading west last night was extremely crowded. The railway was unable to accommodate them due to the lack of trains and the large number of people. Two additional passenger cars were temporarily added, but the train was still overcrowded. This (12th) morning, the refugees on the 5th train and the 3rd train at 12:00 heading west still had no space. According to investigations, more than 3,000 refugees have taken the train west in the past two days. (October 12)</p>
<h3>Fujian Provincial Government Hopes People Will Unite Against Japan</h3>
<p>Various Sectors Express Dissatisfaction with the Provincial Government on Three Matters</p>
<p>Refer to the Provincial Party Headquarters to Request Questions</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The intense anti-Japanese sentiment in various circles in Fujian Province has been reported in this newspaper. A few days ago, the Japanese warship Y-shi arrived, and its sailors landed unarmed. The provincial government specially ordered the Public Security Bureau to send police to entertain them, taking them to Tangchi for bathing and washing away the anti-Japanese slogans in the places where the Japanese soldiers passed. The student community was deeply dissatisfied with this and was severely attacked by the newspapers. On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, representatives of secondary schools and above in the provincial capital met at Fujian College to express their opposition. The provincial government ordered the Public Security Bureau to send armed police to dissolve the meeting, which made the students even more indignant. They proposed a general strike. On the morning of the 5th, the Anti-Japanese Association held a meeting. Regarding the three issues of the Public Security Bureau entertaining Japanese soldiers, washing away slogans, and dissolving student meetings, it was decided to present a petition to the Provincial Party Headquarters to strictly question the provincial government and demand a clear response. For a time, the situation was quite tense. The Department of Education summoned students from secondary schools and above on the morning of the 6th and sent one representative from each class to attend an address. Director Cheng Shigui personally delivered a speech, encouraging the students to develop firm and diligent habits, demonstrate a spirit of unity and mutual assistance, work hard in their studies, and become true national saviors. They should not act emotionally and make useless sacrifices. At the same time, he ordered teachers and staff from various schools to participate in the anti-Japanese national salvation associations organized by the students and lead the students in the national salvation movement. The provincial government also convened members of the Anti-Japanese Association to the government on the afternoon of the 7th to talk with Zheng Baoqing, Lin Zhiyuan, and Chen Peikun from the Provincial Committee, hoping that the people and the government would cooperate to save the country and not hold prejudices and split up on their own. It also explained the two matters of entertaining Japanese soldiers and washing away slogans. However, in the evening, it was rumored that the provincial government believed that the Chaobao's comments on this matter were too intense and considered its attitude unstable, and planned to order its suspension. The press was greatly angered again. On the 8th, the newspaper was still published as usual, and the anger was slightly calmed. As for the secondary schools and above, they unanimously suspended classes for three days from the 8th to carry out anti-Japanese national salvation propaganda. (October 8)</p>

<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Investigate the Circumstances of the Japanese Ship Causing the Accident: The Japanese ship Yijin Maru collided with Xu Huiyuan's cargo ship on the Ren Port River. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported the case and requested compensation from the Japanese ambassador. However, the Japanese ambassador replied, stating that the Yijin Maru was not responsible for the accident and that the Yijin Maru's captain's signature was obtained under duress. The Ministry ordered the county government to thoroughly investigate the circumstances of the day in order to refute the claim. County magistrate Zhang has already ordered Long Yuheng and other water police inspectors from Ren Port to investigate and report, confirming that the Japanese ship was indeed the cause of the accident. According to the sketch drawn by the Yijin Maru captain, Xu Huiyuan's ship was still close to the north bank. As for the statement that the water affairs staff forced the ship to sign and prevented the captain from boarding the ship, the inspectors sent at the time were only asking for the ship's name and inquiring about the details. They did not carry weapons. The water police hired a ferry to board the ship. The entire ship was Japanese, and they could not communicate. Only the compradore and the captain were briefly talked with for a moment, and there was no language of forced resolution or preventing the captain from boarding the ship. The county government will submit the original drawing and the signed documents to the Ministry for review.</p>

<h3>Abstract of the Minutes of the Secret Meeting in Support of Japan's Rights and Interests in Manchuria and Mongolia (Continued)</h3>
<p>Imperial defense strongholds, such as the Xing'an Mountains area and Kailu, Wuchang, etc., are important wartime troop camps. Places such as Changchun, Harbin, and Anda are important areas for replenishing and requisitioning wartime troop supplies, military horses, and high-quality grains. All are either being broken through by the east-west main lines or being held in check by them... In today's environment of established military reduction treaties, the Empire looks to Manchuria and Mongolia as its sole defense center. Fortunately, as mentioned earlier, these locations are known only to key members of our military and important diplomatic officials... Such secrecy ensures that the Feng faction will not be able to detect it... and it is specifically planning that railway to hinder us. It wants to develop its economy, and this is a mere coincidence. If it considers economics as the main point, then what kind of benefits can our country exchange with it, or achieve the goal of stopping it? If it is guided by Red Russian military experts, or even feels the same misfortune as us... then we must first use what kind of strategy to induce it to comply, and then come up with extraordinary plans to stop it... According to the opinion of the General Staff, we should use the fact that the construction of its two east-west main lines does indeed hinder the Empire's national defense as a topic, and demand its abolition... Unfortunately, the diplomatic rhetoric of the Feng faction is extremely cunning. It will definitely say that the construction of its two east-west main lines is purely for the purpose of strengthening its own national defense and developing Manchuria and Mongolia, etc., to reject us. Wouldn't we be blocking our own path and unable to continue speaking?</p>
<p>European and American capitalists have always regarded Zhang Xueliang's rule as a safe place to put their silver. Since the Northeast changed hands, there have been as many as eight groups that vaguely wanted to invest in Manchuria and Mongolia. Among them, the New York consortium originally intended to entrust the South Manchuria Railway Company to invest in Manchuria and Mongolia, but due to the change of hands in the Northeast, and the propaganda of the Chinese side and the American envoy to China, it refused to cooperate with the South Manchuria Railway and secretly sent investigators to Manchuria. It was determined to make the Feng faction its opponent and to directly invest in it. Fortunately, at that time, the Empire used newspapers and financial officials stationed in Europe and the United States to carry out various slanderous propaganda, and the Feng-Yan rebellion broke out, so it was able to stop it. Unexpectedly, after the failure of the Yan-Feng armies, Zhang Xueliang used his old and cunning diplomatic skills to whitewash the facade of a unified government. As a result, the desire of European and American capital groups to invest in Manchuria increased even more... and they particularly emphasized the investment in railways. According to the recent reports from the officials stationed in the United States and Britain received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there are as many as fifteen groups of capitalists in these two countries who are currently making great efforts to invest in Manchuria and Mongolia railways... If this is lost, the Feng faction itself will have no financial resources to complete the railways it plans, but it can use its false unified government as a signboard and borrow thousands of millions of funds from European and American capital countries with just a signature. Moreover, European and American capitalists are in a difficult situation of extreme difficulty in lending today, and we firmly believe that they will flock to it and worship Zhang Xueliang like Jesus. From then on, European and American countries will use what means to protect Zhang Xueliang's regime in order to ensure the safety of their investment territory, and the Empire's actions in Manchuria and Mongolia will be subject to various checks and balances... For the sake of the country's hundred-year plan, we must first... prevent European and American funds from flowing into Manchuria and Mongolia, so that its resources are exclusively owned by the Empire, and even the Feng faction, which holds sovereignty, cannot share the benefits with us... If it is true that they need to build railways to develop Manchuria and Mongolia, at least the construction costs they use must be borrowed from the Empire. No matter how difficult it is, the Empire can also borrow from Britain and the United States to lend to it.</p>
<p>The most tragic thing is that the Empire's national defense strongholds in Wuchang and Changchun, etc., are all being broken through by its eastern main line. In the event of an emergency, no matter how the Empire exerts the Japan Sea centralism, the Empire's military strength will be affected by railways such as the Jihui Railway. No matter how elite they are, the connection between the base and the South Manchuria Railway and the mainland will be completely surrounded and cut off. At that time, even if the Empire has thousands of troops, it may not be able to protect key areas such as the Xing'an Mountains and Kailu. In addition, the wartime supply and transportation of military supplies for the troops stationed in Manchuria and Mongolia will be cut off in all directions. If the Feng army uses the function of the railway network to attack from the northeast, west, and three directions, at that time, the South Manchuria Railway will lose its national defense and military capabilities, and the Empire's troops stationed along the line and in the Xing'an Kailu area will either become prisoners or be completely wiped out.</p>
<p>The Empire should use the Feng faction's disregard for treaties and our country's protests as the reason and opportunity to first accuse it of breaking its promise, and then promote the co-existence and co-prosperity of Japan and China, seeking its permission for us to realize the vested rights of the Jihui Railway as an exchange condition for the construction of the eastern parallel line. If it can allow us, then it does not matter what kind of material or spiritual benefits we use as bait. Moreover, in today's environment of fierce internal conflicts and insincere false unified compromise with Nanjing, we firmly believe that it will be able to realize the ultimate interests and sincerity of itself and accept the Empire's negotiations... At least it must also suspend the construction of the nurture lines such as the Yanji-Dunhua Line, the Yanji-Jihai Line, and the Jilin-Wuchang Line... If even with such sacrificial conditions, it still cannot satisfy it... At least it must also allow us to realize the vested rights of the Hailin-Yanji Line, and the Tiantu Railway should be purchased and operated by the Empire... In this way, although the Empire cannot realize the armed Jihui Railway... the losses suffered by our country in terms of prevention and economy are also negligible, because the construction of its eastern major trunk line has been completed by seven or eight tenths, especially the resource-rich area of the Songhua River Basin has been connected by it, and it has also been connected to Huludao Port, and any interference is difficult to prevent... Therefore, the diplomacy of its eastern major trunk line has to be handled in such a weak manner.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that Huludao Port was realized without anyone noticing it. This is all because the Empire was overconfident and did not prevent foreign capitalists from approaching it beforehand, resulting in today's tragedy. However, the overturned cart in front is a lesson for the cart behind. From now on, we must vigorously implement the strategy of destruction and slander against foreign capitalists who want to invest in Manchuria and Mongolia, which is more effective than direct interference, and can also whitewash the mask of Sino-Japanese friendship and promote the Empire's diplomatic skills.</p>
<p>Furthermore, let us examine its western major trunk line... Fortunately, the section between Taonan and Tongliao has not yet been constructed. If this short-distance route can be prevented... not only can the Empire's national defense key defense strongholds, such as the Xing'an Mountains and Kailu or Baiyintai, be spared from being broken through and threatened... and make its western major trunk line transform into an interrupted form. Although there are existing lines such as the Zhengjiatun-Tongliao and Zhengjiatun-Taonan sections that can be used, it is useless to be circuitous and winding. Calculating the number of miles to the sea is not much shorter than the South Manchuria Railway. If we make the freight equal to it, and then reduce the drinking water warehouse fees in Dalian Port, or even provide the cargo owner with financial convenience and reduce its interest, we firmly believe that this can dispel the true value of Huludao with more than enough to spare, and is the fastest way to save the South Manchuria Railway and Dalian. Moreover, the establishment of the Tongliao-Taonan route is clearly running parallel to the South Manchuria Railway. It is right and proper for the Empire to come out and stop it. If the Feng faction sincerely listens, then it can abandon the vested railway rights between Kaiyuan, Hailong, Jilin, and Wuchang in exchange. There are also nurture lines on its western major trunk line, such as the Changchun-Fuyu-Taonan Line, the Tao'an-Solun-Manzhouli Line, and the Anda-Taonan Line, all of which are connected to the resource-rich areas of northern Manchuria. Although the direct victim is the Chinese Eastern Railway, it is useless... The golden era of the South Manchuria Railway and the prosperity of Dalian Port are mostly derived from this area... Moreover, Anda and Fuyu are important bases for the Empire's national defense military horses and horse feed, as well as the important supply and replenishment and requisition of the Xing'an Mountains regiment, while the Tao'an, Taonan, and Solun areas are the Empire's most important military regiment stationed at the present time... If these nurture lines are realized, the Empire's national defense and economy will be completely broken through... Fortunately, among them, the Changchun-Fuyu-Taonan Line and the Taonan-Solun Line are in conflict with our vested railway rights between Changchun, Dalai, Taonan, and Solun. If we use this as an excuse to stop it, it is also a just and legitimate exercise of rights based on the treaty... If it does not listen, then demand the realization of these vested rights to hold it hostage. If it actually allows us to realize these vested rights, then use this Changda-Tao-Suo Line to nurture the South Manchuria Railway, seize the goods coming from the Anda-Taonan and Solun-Manzhouli sections, extract the prosperity elements of Huludao Port, and nourish our Dalian Port. If it is still not possible... then at least Changchun, Fuyu, Taonan, and Solun must be jointly operated with us. The Empire will not hesitate to sacrifice the vested rights of the Changru Railway and the Guangsuo Railway, because the Feng faction is eagerly seeking the recovery of national rights. If the Empire does not give in slightly, it will definitely arouse great resistance, and make the European and American capitalists, who are eyeing it covetously, concentrate their attention even more and advance into Manchuria and Mongolia, increasing the Empire's crisis.

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Education Association Organizes Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association</h3>
<p>The Education Associations of various counties in Jiangsu, in order to align anti-Japanese steps and concentrate national salvation efforts, have jointly launched the Jiangsu Education Circle Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation, initiated by counties such as Zhenjiang, Wuxian, Wujiang, Wuxi, Danyang, and Gangshan. A notice has been issued to solicit the consent of various counties, and a meeting will be held as soon as more than 30 counties agree.</p>
<p>Announcement on the Organization of the Jiangsu Education Circle Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association</p>
<p>Since the violent sun has been rampant in the Northeast, killing our compatriots and occupying our land, all those with blood and breath are furious. Therefore, anti-Japanese national salvation groups across the country have sprung up like mushrooms, fearing to lag behind. Our Jiangsu has always been the target of Japanese imperialist aggression, and the entire education circle of the province should especially bear the responsibility of being the first to know and the first to act. At this time of national decline and national peril, it is our duty to bravely face the difficulties and there is no excuse. In order to align the anti-Japanese national salvation steps of the Jiangsu education circle and concentrate anti-Japanese national salvation efforts, the Jiangsu Education Circle Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association is launched, with branches in each county and a general association in the entire province, with the legally established education association as the basic organization, and other educational groups can also participate. We hereby announce five righteousnesses as the guiding principles for carrying out our work: (1) Combine the power of the intellectual community to lead the anti-Japanese national salvation; (2) Actively train the masses and students to prepare for the anti-Japanese national salvation; (3) Study anti-Japanese national salvation teaching materials and methods for application in the education circle; (4) Publicize the violent situation of Japanese aggression and arouse the national spirit of salvation; (5) Create a focus of public opinion to urge the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. To be specific in terms of current needs, there is nothing more than the following items: 1. The Ministry of Education has already promulgated the curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools in our country. However, recently the Central Party Department was able to issue an order to increase social disciplines and military training, which is different from the standards set by the Ministry. The Education Department of this province has also formulated anti-Japanese national salvation measures for primary and secondary schools. There are many other places that urgently need to be adapted to the times. How should they be implemented to make the strategy of national salvation deeply rooted in people's hearts and realize it? This requires the organization of this association to discuss it together. 2. Japan has already occupied our Eastern Province with its army, and has sent its navy to harass our coastal areas and the Yangtze River. The outbreak of war is imminent. Our Jiangsu is adjacent to the river and the sea, and it is especially urgent to defend against disasters. How should our educators guide thousands of students to face the national crisis together? How should the education of the national lifeline be maintained? We must formulate a plan as soon as possible so as not to be caught off guard in an emergency. This requires the organization of this association to discuss it together. 3. To create life and to teach lessons, to clarify shame and to resolve to fight, is the duty of our educators. In the past patriotic movements, such as the May Fourth and May Thirtieth movements, the students led by the education circle were always at the forefront, hoping to revive the undying blood. How to incorporate it into the right track, for a worthwhile sacrifice, how to decide on a direction, to develop our national life, and cultivate the vitality of our country, this requires the organization of this association to discuss it together. Alas, the rise and fall of the world are the responsibility of everyone. Our Jiangsu is the location of the national government and the source of gathering for the education circle. Political facilities and cultural dissemination should be ahead of other places. Now, Japan is using warships to penetrate deep into the sanctuary, blockading the important points along the river. If our education circle does not rise up quickly, unite all circles, and strive to fight, then those who mislead Jiangsu will mislead the whole country. Korea is destroyed, Taiwan is dead, and the Northeast is in danger. The fundamental means of annihilation must first annihilate the intellectuals in the region. Alas, comrades in the Jiangsu education circle, for the sake of saving the dead and saving the dying, should rise up for the final struggle. Patriotic compatriots, should unite and strive together, join hands to participate, and save this national crisis. Initiators: Zhenjiang, Wujiang, Jiangning, Lishui, Gaochun, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Danyang, Yangzhong, Chuansha, Jiading, Baoshan, Wuxi, Yixing, Huaian, Tongshan, Fengxian, Xiaoxian, Donghai, Yizheng County Education Association. Temporary Office: Xicheng Printing Company, Red Flagkou, Zhenjiang. Organizational Outline of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Circle Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association 1.

We sincerely request that the perpetrators be severely punished to appease public anger. Sincerely, the Shanghai University Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Students Studying in Japan Went to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>Six Representatives Bought Tickets at Their Own Expense</p>
<p>Submitted Petitions to the Government and Ministries to Sever Diplomatic Relations and Declare War</p>
<p>The delegation of students studying in Japan resolved the day before yesterday to go to Beijing at 10:00 AM yesterday morning to petition the National Government and the Ministry of Education. Later, because the Ministry of Education sent personnel to Shanghai to discuss and arrange matters, and free tickets were not arranged, the delegation has been back in the country for many days, but has not yet achieved the goal of going to Beijing to petition. Therefore, they could not wait and decided to elect six representatives, including Cao Xiuxian, to buy tickets at their own expense and take the overnight express train to Beijing yesterday. They also brought two petitions to the National Government and the Ministry of Education, stating that they should sever diplomatic relations with Japan and declare war, and promote the inherent spirit of the Chinese nation. At a minimum, they must strictly implement economic severance with Japan to punish the violent Japan. The students have decided to return to China as a whole and vow to be the government's support, etc.</p>
<h3>Middle School Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association</h3>
<p>丨Executive Committee Meeting to be Convened Tomorrow丨</p>
<p>Discussing Fundraising Distribution Methods</p>
<p>Location: Shanghai Middle School in Nanshi</p>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association is scheduled to hold its eighth executive committee meeting at 2:00 PM tomorrow (Saturday) in the high school department of Shanghai Middle School on Lujiabang Road to discuss the city-wide fundraising campaign for middle schools to be held from the 26th to the 30th of this month. The funds raised will be used to provide relief to the unemployed employees of Japanese businesses. More than 50 middle schools in this city will participate, with each school taking turns for one day within six days. However, it is feared that there are many middle schools in this city, and the distribution will be difficult at that time, so some will be sent to other places to solicit donations. As for the fundraising method, bamboo tubes and donation books will be used, which are currently being prepared by the affairs section of Guanghua Affiliated Middle School and Qingxin Middle School. In addition, the association's office will be moved to Shanghai Middle School and must be determined after this meeting.</p>

The topic of this lecture is "Venereal Diseases and Tuberculosis," and Dr. Ge Chenghui, a medical doctor, will be invited to speak. Dr. Ge has just returned from Europe and the United States after investigating public health, and she is rich in experience and knowledge, which will surely make a practical contribution to the audience. This issue is scheduled to continue twice. Those who wish to attend the lecture can obtain lecture tickets from the society on Hualong Road.</p>
<h3>Foreign Jurists to Lecture in China</h3>
<p>The Soochow University Law School on Kunshan Road in this city has recently invited jurists from various countries to give lectures at the school in rotation for the past two weeks.

<h3>Jinan University Faculty and Staff Anti-Japanese Association to Hold General Assembly Today</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the National Jinan University Faculty and Staff Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association notified that a general assembly will be held at the school at 2:00 PM this afternoon. In addition to various reports from the Executive Committee, there will also be important proposals for discussion. The school's Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association held a drama propaganda event and invited celebrities to give speeches at Zhiyuan Hall last night. In addition, the school has resumed normal classes and has notified a small number of students who have been absent that they will be considered suspended if they do not return to school by next Monday. Students from Northeastern University and Fengyong University who transfer or audit at the school can check the procedures and complete them as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Labor University to Save the Country Through Academics</h3>
<p>The National Labor University has been working hard to resist Japan this time, and has never stopped classes. Moreover, physical labor is carried out as usual, and the academic style is simple and unadorned, which is very different from the past. The teachers and students of the school are determined to save the country through academics, do less superficial work, and do more practical management, propaganda, research, adherence, organized and disciplined national salvation reading, which can be done at the same time, which is commendable.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Work in Various Schools</h3>
<p>Examples of Municipal Songzhong Increasing Anti-Japanese Teaching Materials: In order to permanently establish anti-Japanese education and care for students suffering from the anti-Japanese war, the Municipal Wusong Middle School of this city added the item "Increase anti-Japanese and research Japanese teaching materials in each subject" to Item 6 of the Anti-Japanese Movement Measures Outline of the school's 16th school committee. The Academic Affairs Office immediately stipulated and notified each teacher to follow it. For the sake of providing reference for various schools, we specifically record its outline as follows: (1) Party Principles: A. Lecture on the continental policy of Japanese imperialism and its ambition and facts of invading our country. B. Inspiration of the awareness and efforts that we should have in the future. (2) Chinese: A. Selectively teach valuable telegrams from various organizations regarding the incident of Japanese imperialism invading the three eastern provinces. B. Practice speeches.

<p>National Salvation Movement of McTyeire School: The students of the school convened a meeting of the student government officials and resolved to make the student government of the entire school the national salvation group. There are two major outlines and eleven detailed items, which have been approved by the principal, and the students are earnestly fulfilling them.</p>
<p>School of Commerce, National Central University: Since the Eastern Province Incident, the School of Commerce of National Central University immediately organized an anti-Japanese national salvation association, organized speech teams to propagate in various places, and published various important international publications between China and Japan. The school affairs meeting decided that all male students should participate in military training from 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM every morning, and all female students should organize a nursing team to study rescue techniques.</p>
<h3>St. John's Alumni Association Investigates Alumni Addresses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the St. John's University Alumni Association has recently found that many alumni have changed their addresses and occupations, and because the street numbers in the concession have changed, alumni have not notified the association, resulting in most of the St. John's Weekly sent by the association being returned. Therefore, it is now actively conducting field investigations and publishing a notice, urgently hoping that all alumni will immediately inform the association office (located at 184 Nanjing Road, 3rd floor) of their new street numbers or new occupations for cooperation and to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>

<h3>Grass Court Tennis Open Senior Singles</h3>
<p>Talks with Mr. Whittall, Executive Committee Member of the Grass Court Association丨</p>
<p>丨The Process of Tawaratsumio's Withdrawal</p>
<p>丨Qiu Feihai vs. Budd Today</p>
<p>The semi-finals of the Grass Court Tennis Open Senior Singles will be held on Saturday, and the finals will be held on Sunday, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, there are rumors that Tawaratsumio has given up participating, and whether this is true is questionable. Yesterday, we visited Mr. Whittall, an executive committee member of the Grass Court Association, who told us the following.</p>
<h3>Executive Committee Member Takes Overall Situation into Account</h3>
<p>Tawaratsumio Willing to Withdraw</p>
<p>Whittall said that sports are originally without national boundaries and absolutely irrelevant to politics. Tennis is especially an ordinary international competition. However, the emotional impulse between China and Japan this time is too strong. There is no problem with the competitors themselves, but the audience may be temporarily excited and misunderstandings may arise. Therefore, the Grass Court Association authorities are quite concerned about the second round of the senior singles. Mr. Tawaratsumio deeply understands the good intentions of the executive committee, takes the overall situation into account, and is willing to withdraw voluntarily.</p>
<h3>Qiu Feihai vs. Budd Today</h3>
<p>One Scene of the Semi-Finals</p>
<p>The semi-final between Lin Baohua and Tealbenau has been resolved, and in the unfinished match between Qiu Feihai and Budd, Budd has not given up. Qiu is leading Budd by 6-2, 6-4, 4-0. The match will continue this afternoon at the French Chamber of Commerce. Qiu's victory is not a problem.</p>
<h3>The Quarter-Finals of Lin Baohua and De Fu</h3>
<p>Similar Playing Styles, Difficult to Determine Superiority</p>
<p>The quarter-finals of Lin Baohua and De Fu will be held at the French Chamber of Commerce this afternoon. The winner will face the winner of Qiu Feihai and Budd on Sunday. According to Whittall's observation, the two have similar playing styles, and it is difficult to determine their superiority. There will be many highlights.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Moody's Far East Tour</h3>
<p>Likely No Competition in Shanghai</p>
<p>Mrs. Moody Wills, the queen of world tennis, is touring the Far East at the invitation of the Japan Lawn Tennis Association with the understanding of the United States Lawn Tennis Association. Whittall said that she is expected to arrive in Shanghai around November or December. The weather is already cold, and there will likely be no competition in Shanghai. It is possible that Mrs. Moody will give a few performances, but it is not yet known. In the opinion of the reporter, the Chinese tennis authorities should make preparations now or send a telegram to welcome her, so as not to fall completely behind.</p>

<h3>Heartbreaking Words</h3>
<p>— Du Juan</p>
<p>Dear compatriots. We are eagerly hoping for the administrative meeting of the League of Nations to stop the atrocities of the Japanese. But it passed lightly again. I don't know when the next meeting will be. The impression we got this time is that this medicine, the League of Nations, is really not enough to dispel our illness. Because the medicinal properties are too weak. Taking it is like pouring soup on stone. And those doctors, although they say they are all famous doctors, but since it is not their own business, they just casually prescribed a prescription, just to do their best. Now it depends on how the patient is. Whether he can struggle and fight the disease. If he can't struggle, then death will come. Or take care of the funeral arrangements.</p>
<h3>Not Removing the Weeds in the Courtyard, Random Talks by Qi Fu</h3>
<h3>The Letter That Wu Zhihui Did Not Reply To</h3>
<p>After the National Assembly was held this year, Wu Zhihui was elected as the chairman of the Representative Qualification Review Committee. Hu Yuan wrote him a letter, asking him to publish the qualifications of the representatives in the newspaper. The gist of this letter is as follows:</p>
<p>"…Seeing the newspaper, I know that you have been elected as the chairman of the National Assembly Representative Qualification Review Committee, and have already reviewed the qualifications of more than 300 representatives. Now, as a member of the nation, I want to ask you a few questions. Judging from the results of your review, how many of the peasant representatives are real peasants, and how many of the worker representatives are real workers? You may ask me in return: What is a real peasant? What is a real worker? I can give a definition: a person who relies on his own hands to work for food is a real worker: a person who relies on his own hands to farm for food is a real peasant. For example, Tao Kan carrying bricks, I cannot call him a bricklayer, nor can I call him a worker. Why? Tao Kan relies on being an official for food, not on carrying bricks for food. Conversely: Wang Mian also studies, but I can call him a peasant, because he relies on farming for food, not on studying for food. According to this definition, how many of the peasant representatives attending the National Assembly are real peasants, and how many of the worker representatives are real workers? Please publish it.…"</p>
<p>This letter never received a reply. Wu Zhihui is now said to be going abroad. I think before he goes abroad, he should settle this account.</p>
<h3>Writing Instead of Pen, Female Volunteers Throw Themselves Into the Army</h3>
<p>— Yun Shi</p>
<p>Recently, because the violent Japan forcibly occupied our Liaoning and Jilin, the whole country has a tragic and enthusiastic anti-Japanese movement. Recently, the women's circles in this city and treaty ports have also organized volunteer armies. With red makeup and iron blood, female heroes are not willing to let their predecessors have all the credit. This is worthy of admiration. However, it has not yet been popularized. Therefore, I will select a few female volunteers from the Chinese Women's Physical Education School Commemorative Publication and the Brief History of the Chinese Women's Rights Movement to serve as a reference for women today.</p>
<p>Ms. Wu Shuqing submitted a letter to Li Yuanhong, willing to join the army. Li said that the army was all men, and it was difficult to place her, and politely declined. Wu Shuqing strongly argued that there should be no distinction between men and women, and used the history of female soldiers in our country since ancient times as evidence. She spoke eloquently and with a hundred times more courage. Li then ordered the separate recruitment of a team of female soldiers, led by Shuqing. As soon as the proclamation was issued, hundreds of people came. Shuqing devoted herself to teaching and training, not afraid of hardship. In a few days, their steps were neat and their spirits were full. The delicate and weak women all became brave warriors. When the civilian army was fighting fiercely with the Qing army, Wu Shuqing led the female army to attack from behind, killing many Qing soldiers. Shuqing was born with physical strength and was especially rich in wisdom. In every battle, she took the lead. The Qing army would be terrified when they encountered Wu's army.</p>
<p>After the Wuhan Uprising, neighboring provinces responded one after another. However, Zhang Xun and others in Nanjing relied on their strongholds and refused to submit, and repeatedly fought with the civilian army, plundering the local area. The civilian armies in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai heard that Nanjing had been defeated, and they bravely fought, vowing to destroy this enemy. They joined forces in Zhenjiang and proceeded in unison. Chen Qimei, the Shanghai military governor, initiated the organization of a women's Northern Expeditionary Force in Shanghai, led by Wu Mulan, and led thousands of female soldiers to assist in the battle. They used a plan to capture the Lion Mountain Fort. A bullet passed through Wu's knees. As a result, the various armies took advantage of the victory to attack. Zhang Renjun, Zhang Xun, and Tie Liang fled one after another, and many of the remnants also fled. Nanjing was liberated from then on.</p>
<p>After the failure of the civilian army uprising, Zhang Mingqi began to come out of the naval headquarters and exhausted himself in arresting party members, causing great disturbance. The famous Wu Jianniang and Wu Qiniang were also arrested because they were in the army and suspected.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned people devoted themselves to the party and the country and threw themselves into the army instead of pens. Today's national hatred is even more serious than overthrowing the Qing Dynasty. May our women's circles pay attention to it three times over.</p>
<h3>World Short Chronicle</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Tea Leaf Fortune Telling Popular in Australia: Tea leaf fortune telling is very popular in the United Kingdom and the United States. They look at the appearance of tea leaves in the teacup to predict good or bad fortune. It is said to be very effective. Now it is prevalent in Australia. Some people make a living from this, calling themselves experts in tea leaf fortune telling. Most tea shops hire them to tell fortunes for their customers to attract customers.</p>
<p>Germany's Newly Invented Special Wallpaper: Beautiful and pleasing wallpaper is one of the essential elements of home decoration, but it cannot last forever, which is ultimately a deficiency. Recently, a German inventor invented a special wallpaper made of vitrified material, which never fades and can be washed with water. Its durability even exceeds that of glass, because it is not as fragile as glass.</p>
<p>Rainmaking Method in the Netherlands: It is a helpless thing when it is dry for a long time and no rain comes. Recently, a Dutch doctor of chemistry has tested his new rainmaking method. He flew a plane high up to the clouds and sprinkled dry ice powder into the clouds. Before long, heavy rain fell. What is dry ice powder? It is carbon dioxide. Why don't chemists in our country give it a try?</p>
<h3>Iron and Blood and Justice</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>"What the world can rely on most is iron and blood." This is the famous saying of Bismarck. The Germanic Confederation jumped to become a global hegemon, shocking all nations. This is clear evidence that one word can revitalize a country. Our country, with a population of 400 million, a land of more than 4.27 million square miles, and a civilization of 5,000 years of glory, has actually succumbed to a small island nation of 140,000 square miles. Now we bow our heads and obey the League of Nations, weeping profusely, hoping that it will uphold justice. Anyone with blood and qi cannot but feel heartbroken. With power in front, justice has long disappeared. We can only lie on firewood and taste gall, engraving it in our hearts, to wash away this strange shame and great humiliation.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese invaders invaded the Eastern Provinces, the national salvation craze has been surging. The blood and tears of young people are increasing day by day. Zeng Kui, an 18-year-old student from Hunan, cut off his finger and wrote a blood letter. Li Jinshan, a worker in Shanghai, even committed suicide out of extreme indignation. All schools across the country have been fully mobilized to carry out the national salvation movement. The desolation and tragedy are enough to prove that the national spirit of our country has not died.</p>
<p>Culture is the product of the human spirit. All human groups should abide by it together. However, when the violent Japan invaded Shenyang, it burned all cultural institutions and important buildings. The brutality and cruelty are different from those of humans. When Napoleon conquered Saxony, his Qi covered the whole of Europe, and when his troops approached Dresden, he issued a hand edict, strictly restraining his subordinates. If soldiers destroyed local cultural buildings, they should be punished by military law. When I traveled to Germany this spring, I saw the majestic ancient palaces, the magnificent churches and national theaters, which have stood for a long time. To this day, Germans are all happy to talk about it. Compared with the violent Japan's self-proclaimed civilization, pretending to be the master of East Asia, its bestiality is exposed without attack.</p>
<p>Belgium, as a small country, is located between the great powers, with an area of only 11,700 square miles and a population of 7.74 million. When the European War broke out, it confronted Germany and was finally able to work hard to be in the front ranks and win the final victory. Our country's territory is 30 times that of Japan and 400 times that of Belgium. A Kunpeng is trapped by sparrows. All nationals cannot but feel ashamed to death.</p>
<h3>Record of What I Heard and Saw in the Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu'an</p>
<p>Tea Houses</p>
<p>I once heard it said near Tianzhi that there was an old tea house west of Datong Bridge. It was opened by an old soldier, and had a corridor along the river, offering a pleasant view of the flowing water. In autumn, the reeds rustled, evoking thoughts of rivers and lakes. I often visited it with friends, chatting over tea until sunset. It was a pity that the water was not as good as that of Kunming, and the tea was even worse. Generally, scholars and officials in the capital did not know good tea, so the tea houses rarely paid attention to this. The tea in the capital was mostly made with powdered tea, which was of extremely poor quality. The best Longjing tea from the South never reached the capital, and there were no connoisseurs of it. This passage describes the tea situation in the capital, and it is quite interesting to read. Northerners prefer "scented tea," which is scented with strong fragrances, but the tea itself is coarse. A piece of paper containing it sells for six copper coins, just enough for a pot, which is very convenient. It is used in all restaurants and tea houses. Wherever Southerners go, Longjing tea is also provided, but it is not genuine Longjing, only resembling its color. Under the pines and cypresses of the Altar Garden (Zhongshan Park, formerly the Altar of Land and Grain, hence the name Altar Garden by recent poets), with simple tables and rope beds, cool shade and fine grass, accompanied by two or three like-minded friends, lingering as the sun moves, is truly the first pleasure in the northern capital. It is a pity that there is no good tea. Someone with the habit of Lu Yu should bring his own tea set, which would be the most wonderful thing. Generally, northerners are not skilled in the art of using flower-patterned copper kettles. However, they are certainly good at choosing scenic spots. The tea house in Taoranting is best when the autumn wind rises, the leaves fall from the pavilions and shores, and the reeds are lush. Leaning against a corner of the precarious railing, watching the setting sun sink into the western mountains, reflecting the golden palace, the scene is most beautiful. Tourists who come here cannot help but linger. In front of the Gongmen in the Summer Palace, on the main road of the Xiyuan barracks, there is a small tea house, next to several ancient willow trees. It is built on a platform of piled earth, with bricks stacked as tables, and a reed shed for shade. In summer, sitting by the stream, the cicada songs fill the ears. Occasionally, one can see ducks and gulls bathing in the water, their feathers bright and clean, chasing each other in play, making one completely forget all the machinations of the world. The description in Tianzhi Occasionally Heard probably refers to this kind of place. Many small tea houses in the city also serve as storytelling venues. The tables and chairs are also very elegant and clean. On a quiet autumn night, slowly sipping a bowl of tea, listening to a blind old man with a drum sing about Cai Zhonglang is a great pastime. The Hongbixuan Tea House used to be located at the east entrance of Longfusi Street. The last stroke of the character "Hong" on its signboard was missing. It was from before the Qianlong era. It disappeared after 1924.</p>
<p>Before the Boxer Rebellion, the largest tea house was Tianhuitang outside the back gate. It had a large courtyard and huge buildings, with brocade railings and bright lanterns. The guests were mostly wealthy and noble, as the area around the back gate had many residences of princes and nobles. The tables, chairs, and tea cups were all specially made, much larger than ordinary ones. Dozens or hundreds of servants rushed around, each with their own rank and authority, in perfect order. During the Boxer Rebellion, it was reduced to ashes. Today, the site is still called Tianhui Courtyard, but there is no longer such a grand tea house.</p>
<p>Today, the national situation is precarious and has reached its extreme. The people of the country should firmly embrace the doctrine of saving the country with iron and blood. "Iron" means studying the fundamentals of science. "Blood" means the spirit of sacrificing oneself and dying if necessary. Having iron without blood will only create tools for aiding tyranny. Having blood without iron is merely the cry of a weak nation. Only by using both iron and blood can we achieve success. Do not be a flash in the pan. Do not be a momentary burst of anger. Persevere with fortitude. Uphold it with constancy. This is profound and steadfast. (Transferring money to help with disaster relief)</p>
<h3>Humanity in the Future</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Dr. Luo Weikesi, an American physiologist, recently published an article titled "Humanity in the Future" in a Washington bi-monthly magazine, which is quite meaningful. I have translated it here for study. The doctor said: When will humanity become extinct? Some say that humans will end with the Earth. In the future, the Earth will collide with another planet, and the destruction of the Earth will mean the extinction of humanity. Others say that humans and other living things must rely on a certain temperature to survive. The heat of the Earth's core will gradually dissipate, and humans and other living things will inevitably perish together. Still others say that the air on the surface will become increasingly thin in the future, the seawater will evaporate, and after years of torrential rain, humanity will be submerged without a trace. The above statements are based on academic theories, but they are not all relevant to the facts. So, what will become of humanity in the future? I can say with certainty that in a few years, humanity will suffer a great calamity, either a great war or a great plague, and be eliminated. Another superior kind of human will rise and replace it. This superior kind of human will be the master of the future. This is because humanity's inferior nature is too heavy, and no amount of education can help. The sources of disease are increasing, and no amount of medicine can be effective. When the time comes, the master of the future will appear. Will the master of the future come from the yellow or white races, or from the brown, red, or black races? It is difficult to predict. In short, this master will use spiritual civilization to defeat materialism. Guns and bullets will be useless. There will be no more cunning, adultery, or theft. Food will be very simple. Lifespan will be about 200 to 500 years. The Great Harmony world will then be realized. The Earth will be filled with auspicious energy, and there will be no more worries about destruction or extinction. Happiness will be boundless.</p>
<p>Short Message: Mr. Lang Deshan, an artist who returned to China four years ago after being abroad for thirty years and was admired by both Chinese and foreigners, has traveled to more than twenty countries since leaving Shanghai. He has been warmly welcomed everywhere, and his art and programs are constantly updated. According to a letter Mr. Lang recently sent to a friend, he will soon depart from New York for China to see the current situation of his motherland.</p>

<h3>The Pestle That Knocks on Dreams (14)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>Tao Chi's interest in studying became even more fervent! He was of course excited for Yan Ruyu, and he was especially excited for feet like water chestnuts! When he went north to take the metropolitan examination, his feet were exhausted from running. He used the tone of the ancients' consolation to his feet: | | feet ah | | feet ah | You work hard to strive for fame and success, and when you achieve fame and success, you will have three-inch embroidered shoes to accompany you at night.</p>
<p>Tao Chi passed the examination and, as a result of his policy questions in the Golden Hall, was ranked third among the top scholars, becoming the coveted Tanhua, the third-ranking scholar, for all 400 million compatriots.</p>
<p>"The wedding night with candles in the bridal chamber, the time when the name is on the golden list;" this is two joys out of the four joys. But Tao Chi's joy had to be penetrated another layer; Tao Chi's wedding night with candles in the bridal chamber was marrying a woman with three-inch golden lilies: Tao Chi's name on the golden list was that of the third-ranking scholar; Tao Chi at this time was simply the darling of heaven.</p>
<p>He recited his own examination papers and policy questions, and felt that the world was | | | The world in Tao Chi's eyes was actually just China | | articles, nothing was greater than this; this alone was enough to secure the country and more.</p>
<p>He stroked his new wife's slender golden lilies, and he became even more arrogant! He believed that his new wife's pair of slender feet, less than two inches long, were definitely not ordinary slender feet! Only because of the social criticism of slender feet: ! | Suzhou feet are not as good as Yangzhou feet: Yangzhou feet are not as good as Taiyuan feet in Shanxi: Taiyuan feet in Shanxi are not as good as Datong feet in Shanxi. The slender feet of Datong women are famous throughout the country; every year on the sixth month's Gift of Heaven Festival, the annual foot-drying fair is held as usual; this is a grand competition for slender feet among all the women, large and small, inside and outside Datong. When Tang Xiuying was not yet married, she also participated in the foot-drying fair and won the honor of being the most slender foot in Datong; this was worth Tao Chi's boasting as a rare luck and pleasure. He believed that marrying the most beautiful woman with the most slender feet in the world was even more difficult and valuable than being a Tanhua. He believed that the feet of women in the world were not even worth counting as feet; there was only one pair of feet in the world, and that was his wife's pair of slender lotus hooks, less than two inches long.</p>

<p>Several Changes: Yesterday, the 15th, the gold price once again broke through the 700 tael mark. It was difficult to curb the twists and turns. It fell in the morning and noon, and then turned from soft to firm in the afternoon. There was a total of nine taels of reversal. In the end, it continued to rise by more than five taels. There were many transactions in the market, but the amounts were not large. People's hearts were floating. When the silver market reported a fall, it immediately rose. Afterwards, the foreign exchange market changed from tight to loose, and the sellers were enthusiastic, so it went from bad to worse. However, there were ups and downs from time to time. The market will fluctuate around 700 taels. The exchange rate was stable and finally showed a gentle trend. There was no important news at home or abroad.

However, the gold price fell by more than five taels in an instant, with a fluctuation of more than one tael from time to time. At 9:30, it was 701 taels and four mace. HSBC's posted price of British gold remained the same, the US dollar increased by 0.125, and the gold price was flat. At that time, it was 0.02 to 0.028 taels. Soon, HSBC sold US dollars for December at 32.5 yuan, and Qianchangxiang and others continued to sell, so it immediately fell to 700 taels and seven mace.

At 10:20, it reached 0.05 taels. But Qianchangxiang, Yuancheng Yong, Fuyu and others all sold, and Mitsui and others sold British gold at 9375, and Shanghai sold 8 pence in November, so the gold price could not stand firm and fell by 0.06 taels.

By the close of noon, it was only 706 taels and continued to be suppressed to within 700 taels, which was also the dumping of physical goods hedging.

<p>Final Turnaround: The afternoon market opened at 699 taels. Daxingyong and others immediately sold. It fell from 699.5 mace to 697.8 mace.

Afterwards, seeing the low price, buying and selling differed, but there was not much volume, and there were ups and downs of one or two taels from time to time. At 3:00, it was 698.8 mace. HSBC and others absorbed US dollars at 32.5625, and Hengxing, Hengchangyong, Dadecheng and others bought in, breaking out of 700 taels again, and at 4:20, it was 703 taels. At that time, retail investors and physical goods hedged , and at 4:30, the market closed at 701.7 mace, which was 0.055 taels higher than the previous day.

<h3>The Big Closing Period is Busy, but the Short-Term Loan is in a Relaxed State</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday was the special big closing period of mid-October. The financial community's handling of closing procedures, due to long-term restrictions, was naturally more complicated than usual. However, the silver dollar situation in the market seemed to be more relaxed than the previous day. Although the internal situation has not yet been relaxed, it must be known that maintaining the status quo on the outside is not a good sign for the financial community.</p>
<p>Short-Term Loan Price: "Dollar Short-Term Loan" The morning market was 0.072875 yuan, slightly better than the previous day by 0.0005 yuan. The noon market was the same price. Although the situation did not show relaxation, there was no significant increase either. "Silver Short-Term Loan" The morning market was 0.03 yuan, and the noon market was 0.026 yuan, a significant relaxation compared to the previous day. The discount was only 0.06-0.07 yuan plus water. The bank's posted price was 0.012 yuan.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: The morning market for Jiangsu small dollars was 0.06595 yuan, and the noon market was 0.0659 yuan. The trading volume in the morning market was 4,000 jiao, and the noon market was 2,500 jiao. The Guangdong small dollar morning market was 0.06545 yuan, and the noon market was the same price. The trading volume in the morning market was 175,000 jiao, and the noon market was 20,000 jiao. Copper coins increased by 500 wen, to 377,000 wen, with a trading volume of more than 32,000 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds" Yesterday, the bank's closing news included Chinese merchants closing more than 4 million yuan, foreign merchants closing more than 3 million yuan, and collateral transactions of 3-4 million yuan. All kinds of cargo, exchange, tax and miscellaneous funds were closed as usual, but the procedures were too complicated to accurately record. It is only known that 500,000 yuan was withdrawn from the warehouse and 800,000 yuan was deposited. Money shops and silver companies closed about 60 million yuan, and the discount fund closed more than 6 million yuan. Exchange funds from various routes amounted to more than 800,000 yuan, and cash settlement was 300,000-400,000 yuan. "Dollar Funds" Exchange transactions in the morning market were 1.7 million yuan, and in the noon market, 1.403 million yuan. Banknotes were 150,000 yuan in the morning market and 65,000 yuan in the noon market. Over-the-counter banknotes were 190,000 yuan in the morning market and 172,000 yuan in the noon market. Bank checks were more than 100,000 yuan. Various trades accounted for 850,000 yuan in the morning market and 700,000 yuan in the noon market. Transactions between banks and foreign customers amounted to 1.8-1.9 million yuan. The discount fund closed more than 2 million yuan, and short-term loan funds amounted to more than 1.9 million yuan. Small money shops traded more than 100,000 yuan. Funds from passenger routes amounted to more than 500,000 yuan, and outflows amounted to more than 300,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Loans Due Have Not Been Fully Disposed Of</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the big closing period of mid-October. The long-term loans from the previous term should have been disposed of upon maturity, but the number of those being restricted was very large. Due to the relationship between the commercial market and the current situation, it was not possible to close as desired. The financial community has tried to find a way to change the situation to ensure that there are no obstacles and to protect the stability of the market. However, it was found that there were many long-term loans that were transferred yesterday, but there were also not a few who were unwilling to continue lending, and each had its own difficulties. This was forced by the urgency of the situation and could not be remedied by human effort. Therefore, the financial community has no way to deal with it. According to sources, a large portion of the funds that have been delayed are still outstanding.</p>
<p>Securities: Bond Prices Continue to Strengthen</p>
<p>Up 7-8 Corners to 2 Yuan Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>Spot Prices Rose Even More Sharply, With 9.6 Million Transacted</p>
<p>Yesterday (15th), the spot market for various bonds on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange still opened with many types, with a total of 27,000 yuan transacted throughout the day. The futures market was slightly better, with the morning market being quite active in both sessions, with a transaction volume of about 7 million yuan. The afternoon market was quiet, with about 2.6 million transacted, totaling more than 9.6 million yuan. The prices generally rose sharply at the beginning due to the good sentiment in the market and active buying. However, after that, the market situation turned balanced, and the market entered a chaotic state, rising and falling suddenly, with a fluctuating trend, but without major changes. As a result, only the 60/60 bond fell by 0.6 yuan, and all others continued to rise, with the 20/20 customs salt tax and 19/19 customs spot prices each rising by 3 yuan, the highest amount. The spot prices for unified tax and the October 19/19 customs rose by about 1.9 yuan, and others also rose by about 0.7-0.8 yuan. In addition, financial spot goods have not been traded for a long time. Yesterday's price in late July suddenly fell by 6 yuan, and the November 20/20 cigarette and customs taxes have risen sharply compared to last week. Looking at the continued rise in bond prices, the diplomatic situation is indeed good, but the future trend of the bond market is still difficult to predict and will continue to depend on the future of diplomacy.</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn: American Cotton Slightly Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was mixed. It was weak due to the weakness of Wall Street and reactive selling. Futures fell by 5-7 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 5-7 points, and spot prices rose by 11 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 15 points. Indian cotton was firm due to speculative buying and short covering. At the close, Japanese merchants sold. Pingguoer rose by 2.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 3.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 5.5 rupees. Recorded on the left (telegram of the 14th):</p>

<h3>Indian Cotton Trade Weekly Report</h3>
<p>Last week, the Bombay futures market remained mostly unchanged due to rain in the Oomrawati cotton region. The cotton harvest was delayed, but the damage was not significant. However, cotton in the Central Provinces and Pirar areas was affected. In terms of spot goods, European exports were quiet. Far Eastern countries showed no interest due to Indian cotton being slightly more expensive than American cotton. Currently, Indian cotton seems to be about fifteen rupees higher than the comparative price. If it can soften, there is still hope for export inquiries.</p>
<p>Grains: Kiln-dried Baige rice decreased by half a yuan.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, more than forty boats from various origins arrived, and river stocks were abundant. Local store sales were sluggish due to low market prices. Southern kiln-dried Baige rice, white rice, and three other varieties each fell by half a yuan. Early and late rice supplies were limited, and prices for goods from other provinces remained unchanged, resulting in another two-tenths of a foot decline. Although the supply of new Lu Yangjian rice was not large, sales were slow, leading to a gradual price decrease with no significant change in silver yuan value.</p>
<p>New Zhabei: Yesterday, forty to fifty boats arrived on the Suzhou River. Local demand was low. Eastern and Western new粳 rice were slightly weaker than before, with prices easing by five jiao each. New Lu Yangjian rice was affected by Saigon rice, with the opening price reduced by two jiao. There were still many goods arriving from Changshu and Wuxi in the north, and trading focused on top-quality goods. Second-grade Jiangyin goods were piled up and quite sluggish, with prices falling nearly a foot. Sales in silver yuan were average, and the market showed no significant movement.</p>
<h3>Limited Foreign Rice Imports and Exports</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market remained quiet. Foreign firms still did not dump goods, and traders from other provinces did not inquire. Local market demand turned to wait-and-see. The market entered a standstill. However, various northern provinces had a strong need, but due to the unrest in Yingkou and Dalian and transportation issues, actual shipments had not yet materialized. If the northern provinces had a large consumption, the market could improve. Yesterday, only local merchants handled 300 packages of small-grain rice for business purposes and recalled 400 tons of small-grain rice for three to four months. The market trend was similar to the previous day's.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Temporarily Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of stagnation because foreign wheat prices decreased by about one jiao. There was still a glimmer of hope for Sino-Japanese relations, so people's sentiment gradually stabilized, and fewer traders from inland provinces were purchasing. However, since the market price was already low, unless there was an unexpected shock, this market price could temporarily hold. However, only Tianjin was purchasing from the north. Factory flour was accumulating, and there might need to be changes this month. As a result, this month remained unchanged, November was up by five li, December and January were up by two and a half li, February was unchanged, and March was up by two and a half li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Fall by Four to Five Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market remained sluggish. Since international relations showed few signs of breaking down, foreign wheat orders could naturally be imported continuously. Recently, the arrival of orders from manufacturers was very smooth. Large and small factories were not worried about the possibility of not being able to produce. Therefore, the standard situation was again suppressed. If foreign wheat does not have problems, it is still oversupplied, so the future inevitably tends to be gloomy. As a result, this month fell four fen compared to the previous day, November fell five fen, December fell three fen, January fell two fen, and February and March fell four fen. North-South Goods: The first batch of new southern Gorgon fruit has arrived.</p>
<p>Trading price of one hundred and eighty yuan</p>
<p>Southern Pond Gorgon Fruit: Yesterday, news came that the first batch of new goods had arrived in Shanghai. The initial market receiving price was only one hundred and ten yuan. Now, due to a gradual increase, the current market selling price has reached one hundred and eighty yuan. The difference is as much as seventy yuan, mainly due to the lack of old stock. The price of old goods is also similar. It will take about a month or so for pond Gorgon fruit to be seen again. The stock of old goods is also lacking. The current market price is thirty-two taels, and the market is stable.</p>
<h3>Pickled Mustard Tuber Supply Scarce, Market Stabilized</h3>
<p>Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber: Recently, sales in various places have been average. However, the trend of gradually decreasing arrivals has stabilized. Market stock is still abundant. Merchant goods opened at nineteen yuan. Currently, the market price for top-grade Zhuang pickled mustard tuber is twenty-two yuan, upper-middle grade is twenty yuan, ordinary goods are eighteen yuan, and the lowest grade is not more than seventeen yuan.</p>
<p>Southern Pond Dried Lily Flowers: Market stock has long been exhausted. However, it is heard that a certain firm still has a small amount of stock. Taking advantage of the time when new and old products are not connected, they are selling at a high price of one hundred and sixty yuan per dan, which is a rare high price.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: The price of Lyon Chinese silk is difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Shanghai White Filature Silk falls again by two to three francs.</p>
<p>Lyon Market: This week, due to the aggressive sales of cheap Japanese silk, sales of Chinese silk filature have become increasingly sluggish. On Monday and Tuesday, the opening price of each kilogram of Shanghai white filature silk fell again by two to three francs. The estimated equivalent price opened at 221 francs, top grade at 168 francs, and medium grade at 122 francs.</p>
<h3>European and American Silk Sales Remain Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market continued to be sluggish. Due to the relentless aggressive sales of Japanese silk in overseas markets, each silk merchant believed that Chinese silk was too expensive. Telegrams were not sent, and only 20 packages of Shanghai white filature silk were imported by Credit Foncier and others, and 18 packages of yellow raw silk were imported by Samsung and others. Prices remained weak.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Increasingly Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firm tea market became increasingly quiet. Fine shoulder tea had come to a complete halt. British and French firms were concerned about the serious situation in the Eastern Provinces. The Shanghai anti-Japanese movement was becoming increasingly fierce. Cargo tea carried by Japanese mail ships could not be loaded, and import intentions became increasingly weak. The entire market, except for the Russian Aid Society, which was handling Gongxi tea as usual, was sparse.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Domestic piece goods sell very well.</p>
<p>Note…Re-branding of enemy goods is again on the rise</p>
<p>The piece goods market for domestic goods has continued the trend that supply cannot meet demand. The Three Sheep cotton flannel from Hongzhang Factory has been sold out, with the price opening at two qian five fen and a half. Dafeng's tribute cloth is still in short supply. The plain white tribute cloth from Jiangyin is largely sold out as soon as it is produced, with the opening price at eight taels. Various goods produced by the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Factory are also extremely active, and domestic and foreign customers purchase them unanimously. Current stock is extremely scarce. However, during this time of anti-Japanese boycott, when domestic goods are selling well, the re-branding of enemy goods has been discovered again. Among them, fine cloth is the most common item. The export of this type of product from Chinese factories is extremely rare. In the past, the market only had heavy-weight goods from Hubei, such as Wannianqing and Racehorse, and goods from this port, such as Balloon, Jincheng, and Human Clock brands. The rest were rarely seen. Lately, the number has suddenly increased, with more coming from Tianjin. However, groups have unanimously recognized them as domestic goods. However, last week, 3,000 to 4,000 pieces of fine cloth from Japanese factories in Shanghai were shipped to Tianjin. It is not difficult for insightful people to ponder what their destination will be. Western one-foot-six-inch yuan flannel has gone from rising to stabilizing. The price for Da Wu Tai is one tael five qian seven fen and a half, Ship Brand is one tael four qian and a half, and Yongle is one tael one qian. Orders were actively traded, with over a thousand pieces being transacted in recent days. Flower cloth, plain cloth, and tribute cloth will arrive in large quantities next week. It is said that they are goods previously ordered by a certain dyeing and weaving factory.</p>
<h3>Medium and Heavy Serge Sells Briskly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, medium and heavy serge sold briskly. Demand from large and small foreign clothing stores on this street was strong, and market sentiment was quite good. Dongfang 3008 sold for three taels seven qian per yard, 3001 for two taels seven qian and a half, Baoduo Xuantuguan for five taels seven qian and a half, Baoke 200 for five taels six qian and a half, Tianfeng for four taels eight qian, and Shui for four taels six qian seven fen five li. It is heard that customers have been buying navy blue for new clothes recently. The Western clothing industry also has a particularly strong appetite.</p>
<h3>Plain Serge Has a Rising Trend</h3>
<p>Yuan Chang blue-gray mixed-color plain serge has been trending well recently, and its selling price has a rising trend. Buyer demand is high, market sales are wide, and Japanese goods are sealed and completely absent. British, French, German, and Italian serge are selling more actively. Yuan color is even more scarce and gaining value. Navy blue is next, and gray is slightly softer. Yesterday, both local and foreign traders had healthy appetites. Commissions that could be deducted in the past have now been completely eliminated and changed to net price. A price increase is likely in the near future.</p>
<p>Coal Ash: North Piao coal dust supply has stopped.</p>
<p>Stockpile of approximately 60,000 tons</p>
<p>North Piao Coal Shoulder: In recent years, sales in Shanghai have been quite extensive. Major factories have adopted it. Last year's sales in this port reached a huge 200,000 tons. This past spring, when the Kailuan Coal Mine negotiated with the Beining Railway Bureau, Kailuan coal decreased arrivals in Shanghai, and North Piao shipments suddenly increased several times. It is known that recently, violent Japan has invaded our Eastern Provinces, causing North Piao transportation to be blocked, and the supply to this port has stopped. Current stock in Shanghai is no more than about 60,000 tons, and the selling price is currently ten taels per ton.</p>
<p>Hardware: Actual hardware transactions are bleak.</p>
<p>Yesterday, hardware transactions were still desolate. The reason is that the current situation is unstable. Only factories are embellishing, and even this seems to be less recently, so the entire city feels particularly quiet. Yesterday, the market opened 600-700 barrels of French West nails at a price of eight taels five qian and a half. Yesterday, Fujian traders purchased 400-500 dan of new 16-20 gauge lead wire at a price of 13 taels 3 qian per dan for 16-20 gauge and 18 taels 7 qian and a half for 21-25 gauge. Yesterday, there were transactions of English steel plates with a half-point pattern at a price of eight taels five qian, but there was no interest in thicker patterns. The market trend has the appearance of being strong externally but weak internally. Yesterday, there was some embellishment with garden lead wire and new iron wire, etc., at a price of five taels. It is rumored that 48 sheets of American white lead are arriving soon, so general purchasers are eager to collect them. The price is generally around 19 taels. Yesterday, the price of bamboo steel bars had fallen to 80 taels upon entry. Although the industry has been working hard to promote sales, construction workers do not dare to accept them. In addition, there are no major changes in the prices of various iron goods, and transactions also feel very deserted.</p>

<h3>Hu Hanmin Strives for Peaceful Reunification</h3>
<p>Telegrams urging Guangdong officials to come to Shanghai</p>
<p>Conduct Peace Conference</p>
<p>Current Foreign Aggression is Urgent</p>
<p>Now is the Time for Unity</p>
<p>After Mr. Hu Zhantang arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, he decided that night, after discussions with important figures in Shanghai, to send a telegram to various officials in Guangdong yesterday urging them to come as soon as possible. Mr. Hu was still staying at Mr. Sun Zhesheng's residence yesterday. Yesterday, many important figures from Nanjing and Shanghai visited him. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Actions: After Mr. Hu Hanmin arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (14th), because the journey was difficult and his health had not yet recovered, he urgently needed to rest. He briefly exchanged greetings with important figures and visitors that evening and did not talk much. He went to bed around nine o'clock after dinner. That evening, Zheng Hongnian, president of Jinan University, hosted a welcome banquet, but Hu did not attend. Lin Huanting was sent to the banquet as his representative. Yesterday (15th) morning, visitors to Sun's residence at No. 10 Molier Road were endless, including Ye Gongchuo, Zheng Hongnian, Xu Qian, Li Liejun, Cheng Qian, Jiang Guangnai, Wang Boling, Wang Xiaolai, and French Consul General Feiwoli, all of whom were received by Mr. Hu. In the afternoon, visitors continued to arrive, including Wang Jingqi, Ma Xiaojun, Chen Guofu, Zhang Daofan, Li Shizeng, Zhao Shibei, and Zhu Haimei. Wu Tiecheng arrived at about 4:00 PM. Shortly after, Zhang Jingjiang and Chen Mingshu arrived and briefly discussed Party and national affairs with Mr. Hu. There was no formal meeting. At 7:00 PM, Hu hosted a banquet at Sun's residence, inviting important figures to gather and chat. Those invited to attend were Zhang Qun, Chen Mingshu, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Jingjiang, Li Shizeng, Zheng Hongnian, Liu Luyin, Lin Huanting, etc., totaling dozens of people. Only casual conversations were held during the banquet, and there were no important discussions. It was not until about 9:00 PM that everyone dispersed.</p>
<p>Telegram to Guangdong Officials: Hu Hanmin sent a telegram to Guangdong the night before, saying: To Mr. Tang Shaochuan, Mr. Wang Jingwei, Mr. Gu Xiangqin, Mr. Xiao Focheng, Mr. Deng Zheru, Mr. Chen Bonan, Mr. Li Delin, Mr. Wu Tiyun, Mr. Ma Xingqiao, Mr. Chen Shoushuo, Mr. Tang Mengxiao, Mr. Qin Liming, and Mr. Li Junpei in Guangzhou: I am deeply grateful for your love and attention. I arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. Now the foreign aggression is urgent, no weaker than in the Jiawu year (1894 Sino-Japanese War), and the phenomenon of internal disorganization is not present in the Jiawu year. The reason for this lies in the repeated internal party disputes in the past and the inappropriate political measures. People always want to use a part of the party's strength as their own, and the party loses its foundation of unity. People always want to be selfish, and they exclude each other. Exclusion leads to more disputes, and everyone is busy with people and anxious about things, so that the purpose of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen showing us how to lead the people to seek national freedom and equality cannot be achieved. And cunning people take advantage of the void to enter and indulge in evil deeds, and they cannot be questioned, leading to the party being blamed for the mistakes and the power being taken by others. Over time, the party is not respected by the people, but is despised by the people, and gradually hated by the people. The difficulty of clarifying politics and the difficulty of rectifying discipline are all due to this. This error is one that we cannot each shirk responsibility for. I may also be one of the people in error, but I usually examine myself, bearing the past mistakes is lighter, and today the hope that we will correct past mistakes is the most urgent. Today is the urgent moment for our party comrades to thoroughly awaken and strive for unity, because there is no way to seek internal party unity without each self-awakening to correct past mistakes. Without the solid unity of the internal party, there is no way to concentrate the strength of the whole country to deal with foreign aggression. I have no problem with people in my life, but I will seek improvement for mistakes and promote justice, because the value of everything in the past is to teach me the future. For this reason, if we want to seek a way out for future political development, we must have the determination to correct all kinds of past mistakes. Now you are in Guangdong, experiencing hardships and not hesitating to sacrifice. What you hold is only this. I deeply believe that our party comrades can understand the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's spirit of love and sincerity, and the party can be united and solid. They can understand the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's spirit of "the world is for all," and all past mistakes can be corrected, and the future plans for internal peace and foreign resistance can also be determined. I hope that you will elect representatives to come to Shanghai to conduct peace talks and discuss major plans together. I am eagerly awaiting this. Sincerely, Hu Hanmin.</p>

(2) The resolutions of the fifth executive committee meeting were read. (3) Matters for discussion: (A) Discussion on whether committee members who are absent should be dealt with in accordance with the General Assembly proposal. Resolved: The secretariat should send a letter to notify them that they must attend meetings in the future. If they do not attend meetings in the past, they should state the reasons. (B) Discussion on the selection and organization of the Disciplinary Committee. Resolved: Approval was granted retroactively. (C) Discussion on how to step up the disposal of seized goods. Resolved: The measures decided by the Standing Committee are still appropriate. However, the seized and confiscated goods should be reported to the Executive Committee on a regular basis. (D) Based on the Joint Supervision Committee's regulations, a telegram was sent requesting Shi Zhaoji to make efforts to proceed with the case. Resolved: Approved. Xie Fusheng, Shi Liangcai, and Li Cishan were appointed to draft the telegram and send it as soon as possible. (5) It was decided to convene a temporary executive committee meeting at 4:00 PM tomorrow (October 15) to discuss the unfinished cases of the meeting. Resolved: Approved. (6) Discussion on the Yuanlai Bank tapioca case. Resolved: This case is an important and major case transferred by the former Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association to the association. The fifth Executive Committee appointed Shi Liangcai, Long Peiyun, Lu Muqin, Wang Changyuan, Wang Pingnan, Ren Jinpin, Xu Mojue, Zhang Zilian, and Hu Shuhua, and other nine committee members to organize a review committee to review the case. According to Shi Liangcai and other nine committee members, there are three types of tapioca purchased: one is Dutch goods, white and not smooth; one is Shantou goods, light gray and coarse-grained. After detailed review, the committee members returned a piece of confiscated goods from Pudong for public unpacking and inspection at the sixth Executive Committee. The confiscated goods were found to be snowy white, smooth, and light lake green. Furthermore, Yuanlai Bank had more than 8,000 bags of goods in Pudong, and the association only confiscated more than 3,000 bags. The remaining Dutch goods were not detained. It was unanimously resolved that the confiscated goods should be confiscated, and Ye Hongying, the manager of Yuanlai Bank, and Shao Zhixing, who sheltered the treacherous merchants, should be submitted to the association's Disciplinary Committee for punishment. Furthermore, the Wusa Pharmacy had continuously privately imported Japanese goods and hardened fish oil from April to June without registering with the association. The association's investigation department found and sealed up 132 boxes, and the ninth Standing Committee resolved to confiscate them.</p>
<p>Announcement of Inspection of Stores for Japanese Goods</p>
<p>To be Handled in Conjunction with the Inspection Teams of Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>Inspectors Wear Badges and Certificates</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association issued Announcement No. 10 yesterday, stating: In accordance with the resolution of the association's fifth Executive Committee meeting on October 9, specific measures for inspecting stores for Japanese goods will be implemented by the inspection stations in each district. It is hereby announced: (1) Inspectors from each district inspection station shall inspect stores for Japanese goods in conjunction with personnel from the Japanese goods inspection team of the respective trade association. (2) Trade associations that have established Japanese goods inspection teams shall register with the association's inspection department before the 23rd of this month. (3) Trade associations that have not established Japanese goods inspection teams shall establish them before the 23rd of this month and register with the association's inspection department. (4) If a trade association still fails to establish a Japanese goods inspection team after the deadline, the association's district inspection stations may send personnel to inspect independently. (5) When disputes arise between the association's inspectors and the trade association's inspectors in identifying Japanese goods, if the chairman or three or more standing committee members of the trade association provide written proof that the goods are definitely not Japanese goods, they may be temporarily allowed not to be detained and sealed in their original location. The association will take samples and ask experts to review them. If it is found to be Japanese goods, the chairman or three or more standing committee members of the trade association shall be jointly responsible with the owner of the goods. (Note) All inspectors, investigators, and detectives of the association wear triangular badges of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and employee ID cards with their photos attached. When they come to inspect factories and stores, they can first verify these credentials to prevent fraud. Warning to Various Shipping Companies</p>
<p>Dismiss Japanese Employees</p>
<p>Do Not Purchase Japanese Fuel</p>
<p>Reject Japanese Share Capital</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association warned various shipping companies yesterday, stating: It has been reported that Zhaoxing Company, Zhengji Company, Yuda Company, Datong Hezhong Company, and other Chinese shipping companies are all employing Japanese personnel and purchasing Japanese coal fuel. It is also said that they are jointly established with Japanese investment to avoid requisition by the Chinese government and plan to replace them with Japanese flags in times of crisis. Based on this, since violent Japan invaded our Eastern Provinces, occupied land, and killed people, and judging from the current situation, it can be said that their humiliation of our nation has reached its limit. In this national crisis, all of our compatriots who have a little conscience are unanimously rising up to not use Japanese goods, not hire Japanese people, reject Japanese investment, and sever ties with Japan, hoping to make a final struggle to prevent the crisis. This shows that people's hearts are not dead, and things can still be done. These shipping companies are all high-level merchants, why are they still unaware and shamelessly seeking shelter from the Japanese, cutting themselves off from their compatriots? Therefore, we solemnly warn them to dismiss Japanese employees, not purchase Japanese fuel, and reject Japanese share capital immediately, with the determination to perish with the country and the ambition to wield swords at the invaders.</p>
<h3>Avoid Japanese Ships for Orders</h3>
<p>And Do Not Stop at Japanese Wharves</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce notified all members yesterday, stating: On the 14th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association stating: It has been decided at the association's fifth Executive Committee meeting to discuss how to avoid Japanese ships for foreign orders: (1) The association will forward a letter to your association to notify the International Chamber of Commerce that if foreign ships load goods onto Japanese ships or stop at Japanese wharves, it will be difficult to load and unload goods. Please pay close attention. (2) Please include a clause in the contracts that Chinese merchants sign with foreign merchants, stipulating that all goods imported shall not be loaded onto Japanese ships, otherwise the goods will be returned and all losses will be compensated. Accordingly, we forward the documents. It is hoped that you will check and process them. If the order has been placed in a standard format, this proposal can be used as an additional clause. A written declaration can also be made temporarily by both parties.</p>
<p>Request to Send Boy Scout Training Officer</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters yesterday, stating: Violent Japan's invasion of the Northeast is an unprecedented humiliation. All of our compatriots are filled with righteous indignation and determined to fight to the end. However, trying rashly without military training is tantamount to throwing eggs against stones. The Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Group, in view of this, has decided to conduct military specialties such as infantry shooting and field tactics in addition to the original training, starting today, in case of emergency. However, it is difficult to find military experts. We have always admired your department as a well-known revolutionary army with abundant talent and rich knowledge. We dare to request that you appoint an officer to serve as the volunteer military instructor of the Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Group. The time will be from 7:00 to 8:00 every morning and Sunday morning. This matter is related to saving the country, and we will surely accept your approval.</p>
<p>Middle School Students Across the City Set Off to Raise Funds</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese Work by All Sectors</h3>
<p>Postal Workers' Volunteer Army Trained Yesterday: The volunteer army organized by Shanghai postal workers, divided into two regiments, officially began training yesterday. Classes were held at the Nanshi Sports Ground and the Beishi Qingyun Road open space. As dawn broke, Nanjing regiment members flocked to the grounds, with a total of sixty-nine people arriving. At 6:15 a.m., instructors guided the squads in practicing marching. Despite the biting morning wind, each team showed great spirit. As the whistle blew, the sound of footsteps rose in unison, demonstrating good order. At the Beishi morning class, 132 regiment members arrived at the grounds around 6:00 a.m. Instructors began training, strictly correcting their marching. After a brief speech at 7:00 a.m., both groups dismissed around 7:00 a.m. In the afternoon, the number of regiment members arriving in both cities was more enthusiastic than in the morning class. More than 260 people arrived in Beishi, and 120 in Nanshi. The instructors' guidance was the same as in the morning class. Each team wore uniforms identical to those of the army, and from a distance, they looked just like soldiers in the ranks. Most of the members who joined this time are senior and outstanding postal workers from the Shanghai Postal Bureau.</p>
<p>China Woolen Mill Industry Group Volunteer Army</p>
<p>The China Woolen Mill Industry Association held an anti-Japanese national salvation propaganda meeting at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 2,000 representatives and workers from various woolen mills attended. The presidium consisted of Gu Jiuru, Huang Jinyang, Xu Juetang, Lu Wenzhi, Ke Ganchen, Fan Lianqin, and Wang Honghui. After the rituals, speeches were given by Zhao Erchang, representative of the Municipal Party Department, and Xue Guangqian, representative of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce (speeches omitted). Discussions then began, and the entire assembly unanimously resolved: (1) to never purchase Japanese goods and implement economic severance; (2) to organize a volunteer army to jointly face the national crisis. Finally, the National Goods Propaganda Troupe gave a disguised performance with many alarming and impassioned words. The meeting adjourned around 7:00 p.m. Declaration of Workers from Japanese Textile Mills: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Workers from Japanese Textile Mills issued a declaration yesterday, urging compatriots to rise up and call for the government to declare severance of relations with Japan, prepare for armed force, and fight to the death with the brutal Japanese. It also called for the brutal Japanese acts to be announced to the world so that justice would prevail and there would be sympathy for them. They wished that all compatriots would arm themselves and jointly face the national crisis, and the association's 80,000 workers were willing to join the volunteer army to be at the forefront of the fight against Japan, regardless of any sacrifice.</p>
<p>Tongyang Zhuang Rush to Return Goods: The various Tongyang Zhuang businesses in this city, in view of the severity of the current anti-Japanese national salvation movement, realized that Japanese goods must not be tolerated. Therefore, they rushed to return goods ordered from Japanese merchants. Some goods that had already been loaded onto ships bound for China were not unloaded and were temporarily stored in warehouses by Japanese merchants or transshipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>All Chinese Employees of Hanhe Yangxing Resign: All Chinese employees of Hanhe Yangxing on Wuma Road and Wusong Road sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed editors of Shen Bao, we are outraged by the Japanese military's forceful occupation of our Northeast. As we are employed by the Japanese merchant Hanhe Yangxing, we hereby sever economic ties with the Japanese. We have always held a patriotic heart. From today onwards, all Chinese employees will resign en masse."</p>
<h3>Sanlin Business Firms Patriotic</h3>
<p>All can deeply understand the importance of the cause</p>
<p>Automatically seal up Japanese goods</p>
<p>Express determination to resist</p>
<p>The Fourth Inspection Office of the Shanghai County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association (Sanlin) was established on the first of this month under orders and began its work. It has been diligently inspecting tirelessly. It is reported that the director of the office, Bi Xin, and the deputy director, Ding Guanyan, in order to intensify their work, divided the sixteen inspectors into four groups, starting the day before, and sent them out in shifts to inspect the Jiangpu Wharf, Shangnan Railway Station, and vehicles going up and down the railroad, responsible for inspection. It is also reported that various shops in this town, such as Xinchang Foreign Goods Store and Qian Taihe Southern Goods Store, can all deeply understand the importance of the cause and have automatically sealed up the remaining Japanese goods for sale, requesting the Inspection Office to send personnel to inspect and verify them one by one, affix seals, and vow not to sell them again, in order to show their determination.</p>
<h3>The Public Should Severely Punish Traitorous Merchants in Minhang</h3>
<p>Daring to sell Japanese goods when the national crisis is at hand</p>
<p>Still daring to gather crowds to commit violence during yesterday's inspection</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The Shanghai County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, based on the resolution of the second standing committee meeting, "this association's members will go to various districts this Thursday and Friday to conduct spot checks on shops for Japanese goods," started at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. All standing committee members, together with students from the Minhang Township Teachers' School, divided into four teams to conduct inspections. The inspectors were peaceful in their attitude and sincere in their words, and the inspections were generally smooth. At that time, many Japanese goods were found and immediately gathered at the People's Education Center to be identified after the inspection was completed. When the inspection reached Xinxiechangxiang, Donghuida, Wangxieshun, and Sanyang sundry goods stores, these stores had a lot of Japanese goods. Since they had not registered in advance, and at a time when the anti-Japanese atmosphere was tense, they were still displayed in the windows. The inspectors then legally intended to detain the goods. Unexpectedly, the stores refused to comply and spoke disrespectfully. The inspectors' reasoning with them was ineffective, so they returned to the People's Education Center and reported to the committees, who immediately convened a temporary emergency meeting to discuss how to deal with the situation. At that time, Xinxiechangxiang, Donghuida, Wangxieshun, and Sanyang sundry goods stores gathered hooligans to surround the People's Education Center, shouting and cursing loudly, their momentum fierce, determined to retrieve the detained Japanese goods. When the First District Public Security Bureau heard about this, it immediately sent many senior police officers to try to suppress the situation, but it did not riot. However, because it was difficult for the committees to make a decision at that time, the goods were temporarily handed over to the Chamber of Commerce. The committees then walked out with their entourage, but as soon as they reached the gate of the People's Education Center, the thugs rushed forward and surrounded and insulted them. Finally, because there were too many people, the police could not maintain order, resulting in the secretary of the Anti-Japanese Association, Chen Guoan, being beaten and injured, and his long gown torn and taken away, along with his badge, fountain pen, and other items. When the committees were protected by the police and boarded the car, a group of thugs took the opportunity to break the windows of the long-distance bus and jumped onto the car to provoke trouble again. Later, after the police worked hard to disperse them, they were able to drive back to Shanghai. It is reported that the Anti-Japanese Association regards this incident as an unfortunate event in the anti-Japanese work and must thoroughly investigate it. It has been decided to hold an emergency joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees today to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Japanese Shipping Business</h3>
<p>No Chinese Passengers or Cargo</p>
<p>Various Routes Reduce Trips and Suspend Sailing</p>
<p>Shanghai Japanese commercial shipping has always ranked second in import and export business. Since September 18th, due to the impact of Chinese merchants stopping shipping cargo, Japanese ships have had nothing to do. Recently, some have stopped trips, suspended sailing, and reduced the number of ships. The following is a record of what has been heard:</p>
<p>North China Reduces Ships: The Japanese ships sailing to Tianjin, Qingdao, Weihai, Yingkou, and other ports in North China, including those of Osaka, Nisshin, Dalian, Kawasaki, etc., numbered more than 20. Since this month, Japanese ships going to Beiyang have had virtually no cargo to load. Regular scheduled ships export only one or two tons of cargo, while temporary ships will be empty. Therefore, Dalian Company's eight cargo ships on the North China route have stopped sailing. Although other Osaka Nisshin ships have not suspended sailing, there is no business at all.</p>
<p>Upper Yangtze Suspends Ships: The Nisshin Company's river ships on the Upper Yangtze originally occupied the most advantageous position in business. Now, because Shashi, Yichang, Chongqing, Wanxian, and other places unanimously refuse to load Japanese ships, two ships are moored in Shanghai, and the rest are anchored in Hankou.</p>
<p>China-Japan Reduces Trips: The Nippon Yusen Kaisha's China-Japan line has always enjoyed a monopoly profit because no other company operated on it. The Japan-Shanghai line has recently expanded to four routes: Kobe-Nagasaki, Moji-Osaka, Yokohama, and Nagoya-Yokkaichi, with a total of nine regular ships and two temporary ships. There were always ships full of cargo and passengers. Since September 18th, after Shanghai stopped buying Japanese goods, business has declined daily, with each ship carrying only one or two hundred tons of cargo, resulting in a significant loss. The company has now agreed to suspend the two temporary China-Japan ships first, and also to suspend one Hokkaido ship. They are still considering reducing another four ships. As for the near-sea Yangtze River ships going directly to Japan, the original 11 ships have now been reduced by six.</p>
<h3>Results of the American Expert's Examination of Tap Water</h3>
<p>There is currently no unfairness in water prices</p>
<p>Abstract of the report of American expert Mr. Hill on the investigation of the Shanghai British-owned Waterworks Company. The scope of the investigation of the tap water problem by the Municipal Council is as follows: (1) To examine whether the management of the waterworks company is proper and economical, and whether its current expenses and maintenance costs are legitimate; (2) To examine whether the current tap water prices are mutually discriminatory and unfair to various users; (3) To examine whether the current water prices are fair to general users; (4) To explain whether the company's past profits and current income should be mentioned in the same breath; (5) To examine the appropriate need for future capital to ensure a sufficient supply of pure tap water in the future; (6) To examine whether it is economically feasible to replace the current water price calculation method with water meters. The results of the examination of the above sections are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The 58% increase in the cost of tap water in recent years is purely due to the impact of the increased gold price in paying dividends in pounds sterling. However, the waterworks company is quite supportive of the idea of calculating new capital in silver in the future. Calculation in silver can stabilize water prices and tend to reduce water production costs, especially when the silver exchange rate is low. Most of the remaining increase in costs is due to the increase in living expenses, which necessitates an increase in salaries and wages. There is nothing to criticize about the increase in salaries and wages. Laying off personnel may save some money, but the actual impact on water prices is not significant, and the company must have some flexibility in industrial management. There is no harm in studying the issue of layoffs within the scope of not sacrificing work efficiency, or even implementing more stringent economic measures to seek other savings, but generally speaking, the company's policies have been cautious and economical. If there are still criticisms of the management of the waterworks, it seems close to being nitpicking. Leaving aside various minor issues for the time being, the amount of water production cost is the best standard for examining the company's management. Although opinions may differ on various details of the company's management, the company can supply water at the current price, and its cost is already low. I make this statement with the consideration that Shanghai's wages, prices, etc., are different from other cities, and with consideration of the gold and silver exchange rates. For a detailed discussion of management efficiency, engineering equipment, and water production costs, please refer to pages 15 to 44 of the report. (2) In terms of the ideal and precise burden of water production costs, the current water prices are indeed unfair and discriminatory, but under the current situation in Shanghai, discriminatory water prices that favor poor and small users are an economic necessity, so it is doubtful whether the view of increasing the burden on them is appropriate. The discrimination in water prices may be very serious, but it is not very obvious in terms of the existing water supply prices, that is, the water prices paid by the local government for fire protection. According to the existing water prices, the amount paid by the Municipal Council to the waterworks company is only enough to offset the interest on the cost of the company's water mains, as well as various maintenance and repair costs. The limited amount is certainly not enough to offset the appropriate income from the capital invested in fire protection, because suitable fire protection equipment requires not only the installation of fire hydrants. In order to make the fire hydrants convenient to use, it is also necessary to install pumping stations and filter stations, as well as to increase the size of the main water pipes. Otherwise, without fire protection services, this equipment can be reduced. However, the Municipal Council has not paid the expenses it should pay for the income needed to add such machinery, so after my examination, I concluded that the income from fire protection services should be increased, and the water prices for water supply using water meters should not increase the burden on poor and small users. See pages 92 to 96 of the report. (3) In order to examine whether the current water prices are fair to users and without discrimination, it is necessary to trace various basic principles and determine how much interest should be earned from the fair value of all properties for public use and convenience. American courts at all levels have repeatedly stated in various ways in countless cases a principle that public utilities have the right to obtain fair interest on the fair value of all their property used for and very useful for public service. This principle has been repeatedly determined by the United States Supreme Court and can be regarded as the law of the United States because it is a fair and non-discriminatory principle, so it is very suitable to apply this principle to the existing situation. The application of this principle involves the determination of two elements: one, the fair value of the property; two, the fair interest income. The method I used to determine these two elements is based on the methods currently recognized in the United States, but has been slightly modified to suit local conditions. I checked the company's property, worth a total of 26.25 million silver dollars, based on the company's books when it was purchased, and determined it after correcting the differences between current wages and prices and the wages and prices when the property was purchased. However, the value increased due to the drop in the silver price is not included. The fair income of a property of this value is a constant annual interest rate of 8.5%, which must be sufficient to guarantee the company's credit so that it can obtain the new capital needed for various improvements on reasonable terms in the ordinary market. The level of interest rate largely depends on whether the securities issued have the following conditions: 1. Capital protection; 2. Income stability; 3. Market circulation; 4. Value as collateral; 5. No need to worry. All of the above factors have been considered. The extent to which bonds with perfect collateral meet the above conditions is clearer than that of stocks. The interest rate required to obtain funds from issuing such bonds is lower than that required to sell stocks. In order to keep the interest rate of the bonds low, the net profit of a company should avoid drastic changes and must be at least twice the interest payable on the bonds. If the permitted water prices can supply sufficient surplus to establish sound credit, the British-owned Waterworks Company can sell 6% bonds with an amount equal to half of the company's property. The remaining half of the required capital can be raised by issuing stocks with 9% dividends. If we estimate the company's fair income based on the theory that the company should still bear the exchange risk, there must be room for profit to divide dividends and other public funds annually, and to prepare for small changes in water production costs caused by occasional wage and price fluctuations, so water prices must enable the company to have at least 2% of the share capital in surplus so that various reserves can be maintained appropriately. According to the above various circumstances, the average rate of company income is as follows: The interest on 6% bonds of half of the capital is equal to an average interest of 3% of the total capital; the dividends on 9% stocks of half of the capital are equal to an average dividend of 4.5% of the total capital; the surplus of 2% of half of the capital is equal to an average surplus of 1% of the total capital; a total of 8.5%. According to the above standards, in order to make the fair value of the company's property obtain fair interest, the total income required in 1931 should be 26.25 million of fair interest, totaling 2,231,250 silver dollars; office expenses: 1,744,191 silver dollars; house rent, land tax, and other expenses: 68,404.12; reserve for old assets: 266,133 silver dollars. The total of the above three items is 2,078,728 silver dollars. The total income required in 1931 is 4,309,978 silver dollars. This total income can be compared with the budgeted total income of 4,316,163 silver dollars for this year according to the water price contract. The company's budgeted income for this year includes all dividends for legitimate reserves, extra dividends, and bonus shares, and its total amount is approximately equal to the fair interest estimated for the fair value of the company's property. But it must be remembered that since all extra bonuses are neither accumulated nor fixed, by their nature, this bonus is not a major issue. From this point of view, there is no reason to say that the company's existing water prices and other expenses are excessive. It should be known that the company's income for this year cannot be adjusted at present, and there is no available surplus to allocate to reserves. The total amount actually obtained by the company this year will be significantly less than the fair interest income. I believe that the main fact is that the local currency is based on taels, water prices are paid in silver dollars, all accounts are calculated in silver dollars, and all capital expenses are recorded in silver dollars in the year when the capital was used, including the value of gold coins purchased in that year. The rise and fall of the silver price is a matter of opportunity, so the risk of profit and loss due to the rise and fall of the silver price should not be borne by the users. In other words, when the fixed water prices are sufficient to enable the fair value of the property calculated in silver to obtain fair interest, the users have done their part. If the company chooses to issue pounds sterling notes and allocates dividends according to pounds sterling, and the change in the exchange rate makes the interest income calculated in silver insufficient to distribute the expected dividends calculated in pounds sterling, all losses should be borne by the shareholders. On the other hand, if the exchange rate is beneficial to the pounds sterling shareholders and the fair income calculated in silver exceeds what is sufficient to distribute the expected pounds sterling dividends, then the shareholders can collect their benefits, which is not unfair to the users. The above is a fundamental principle to determine the fair benefits that should be obtained from the fair value, so it has nothing to do with the conditions specified in the existing "water price contract". See pages 47 to 79 of the report. (4) Regarding whether past profits and current income should be mentioned in the same breath, various courts, including the United States Supreme Court, have argued in several cases that past losses cannot be used as a basis for determining whether current water prices are fair. The New York State Supreme Court heard a certain condition, considered this issue, and referred to the precedents of the United States Supreme Court, and ruled as follows: "One inference seems necessary, that is, even if past losses cannot be used as a standard for setting water prices, then past profits and profits obtained from saving expenses, or more profits, cannot be used as a standard. In short, since taxpayers are unwilling to compensate the company for past losses, they cannot recover their past profits." See page 45 of the report. (5) The basic level of ensuring the supply of pure water materials in the future has also been carefully considered. I believe that the basic expenditures budgeted by the waterworks company are quite fair and reasonable. By December 31, 1935, this expenditure should be more than 3 million taels to ensure that the sufficient supply of pure water materials can be maintained appropriately. See page 98 of the report. (6) Installing water meters is the only effective and economical way to limit household waste. Although annual costs cannot be eliminated immediately, the savings in basic expenditures required for future expansion work will be enough to offset the value of water meters over the years. Generally speaking, the experience of using water meters to prevent waste of water materials is quite satisfactory and can offset the expenses and difficulties in adopting this method. The amount of water used and a bill are issued once every three months, which is an effective way to remind people that tap water faucets must be tightly closed. The public will not ignore the continuous flow of water volume and water materials, because the trickle of tap water, like the dripping of water and grains of sand, accumulates into a huge amount. Even plumbers can understand in time and make the repair of the water meter location and the work of the faucet more precise than the location without a water meter. Water meters are free for users to use, and the water materials they need are controlled by the company in a constant and reliable manner, so users do not need to pay for the value of the water materials they do not need, and the company does not need to supply the water materials for which it cannot be compensated. As for the water prices set according to the surface of the water, they can prevent it from increasing the burden on poor and small users. See pages 30 to 35 of the report. In addition, Mr. Hill also expressed his deep gratitude to accountant Mr. Wei Jinsheng, Mr. Habble, Director of the Works Department of the Municipal Council, and other staff members, Mr. Bealson, Chief Engineer and Manager of the Waterworks Company, as well as the Taxpaying Chinese Association and the Shanghai Real Estate Association for their sincere assistance.</p>

<p>According to the Great American Evening Post, this morning (the 15th), the American naval authorities in this city received information that the supply ship Peaver and seven submarines of the US 9th Submarine Squadron will not come to Shanghai again, but will go straight to Hong Kong, stay for a few days, and then return to the Philippines. The order issued by the US Navy Department two days ago to sail to Shanghai has been cancelled. The 10th Submarine Squadron is currently anchored in Qingdao, awaiting orders to return to Manila. It is still unknown whether it will pass through Shanghai in the future. According to reports, the 9th Submarine Squadron's departure from Qingdao to Yantai was a normal action. However, a certain newspaper in New York considered it to have political implications and could occupy an important position on the transportation line between Japan and Manchuria. After seeing this argument, the US Navy Department, in order to prevent misunderstandings, immediately ordered it to sail to Shanghai, but yesterday it cancelled the previous order and ordered it to go straight to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Shuai Songping Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Uttered Grievances Bitterly Before Execution</p>
<p>Requested the Judge to Recover Outstanding Debts</p>
<p>Notified Family Members to Collect the Body</p>
<p>Confessed and Shed Tears Like Rain</p>
<p>Lu Shaotang, compradore of the Fairall &amp; Co., was kidnapped but escaped. The police have arrested many criminals in the case, and they have been punished accordingly. However, the leader of this case, Shuai Songping from Jiangxi, 52 years old, who once held important positions in the political circles, was arrested in Tianjin. Lu Liankui, Chief Detective of the General Investigation Department of the General Police Station, Detectives Liu Shaokui, Tang Jian, and others went to Tianjin to bring Shuai to Shanghai and handed him over to the First Special District Local Court. He was interrogated repeatedly.</p>
<p>Shuai was sentenced to death, and the sentence was submitted to the provincial government for approval. The execution was scheduled for the 15th of this month, which was yesterday. At around 2 p.m., the police escorted Shuai to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Because Shuai was in prison, he looked thin and dispirited. Judge Cheng Shangfeng came to the court and announced to Shuai Songping that today was the day of his execution and asked if he had any last words. Shuai said that he felt he was wrongly sentenced to death in this case.</p>
<p>He Felt He Was Genuinely Wronged. Because when Lu Shaotang was kidnapped, he was not in Shanghai but in Tianjin. But after being arrested and brought to Shanghai, three people, monk Bao Hong, Zhang Guixiang, and Wang Jinsheng, acted on his behalf to hire lawyers and agreed on a "movement fee" of 10,000 yuan, of which 3,500 yuan was paid in advance, and then another 1,500 yuan was borrowed from relatives and friends and handed over. In the end, he was still sentenced to death. His lawyer said that he would apply for a retrial, but he did not expect that the execution date had already arrived today.</p>
<p>This is National Law and there is nothing he can do. He only asked the presiding judge to recover the 5,000 yuan of the movement fee for him. Judge Cheng then announced that his lawyer had written a petition on his behalf requesting a retrial, and the court had also received the request, but the crime he committed was subject to the law for punishing kidnappers and could not be appealed. Now, did he have any last words for his family? Shuai continued, "My son's name is Shuai Lei. He currently lives on the second floor of a Hu family's house at No. 79, Hehe Lane, Xiafei Road, French Concession. Please notify him on my behalf and write two letters on my behalf, one to my younger brother Shuai Lanping at the Zhonghua and Xuehua Soap Factory, No. 6, Nanding Temple, instructing him to bring my third concubine in Shanghai, my fifth concubine in Changzhou, and my four-year-old son back to Jiangxi for care. Furthermore, he must</p>
<p>Bring My Remains Back for Burial. There is also a letter to my friend Bao Jinshi at the Xialun Silk Factory at the intersection of Nanshan Road, Gonghe New Road, Zhabei, because he borrowed 2,000 yuan from me in the 18th year of the Republic of China. Zhang Kunji, who installed electric lights at Jincheng Lane, Songshan Road, owes me 700 yuan. I have deposits of 1,600 yuan and 600 yuan at the World Book Company, and 2,300 yuan at the Riye Bank. Also, Hu Zhongqing, director of the Beijing Office, currently residing at No. 6, Rixing Lane, Japanese Concession in Tianjin, also</p>
<p>Owes Me 10,000 Yuan. Although there is no proof of this debt, since I was arrested, I needed money everywhere, so I wrote to him from prison to ask for it, but I have not received a reply. There is also Xu Zhaozhang, who borrowed 8,000 yuan from me in the 5th year of the Republic of China when he was in charge of the Daxin Customs due to an unclear account handover. I request that the above-mentioned debts be noted down and that my son be asked to collect them on my behalf. I have nothing else to say." Judge Cheng approved it and ordered him to be taken away. He was escorted by Chinese and Western police officers into a car, together with</p>
<p>All Case Files and Photos were sent to the Caohijing execution ground. The court notified Yang Wenjun, a prosecutor from the local court, to serve as the execution supervisor. Police Chief Xu Jinqing and Police Officer Chen Xihui were ordered to lead execution police officers Gu Hanqing, Zhu Wanyuan, Xue Bingzhang, Zhang Chunsen, and others to the execution ground by car. After Prosecutor Yang and Prison Warden Dong Changmin took their seats, the police officers brought Shuai up. Shuai was</p>
<p>Wearing a Grey Silk Pongee Long Gown with a fair complexion. He looked refined and did not seem like a vicious criminal. Lu Bohong paid for holy water for him. The judge then questioned him further. According to Shuai's confession, he was 50 years old, from Jiangxi, and currently residing in the home of a relative, Wu Ziying, on the second floor of No. 79, Hehe Lane, Xiafei Road. After my death, please send a letter there and ask them to collect my body. Now that I have been sentenced to death and executed, there is nothing else to say.</p>
<p>When Shao Tang was kidnapped, I was in Tianjin, and now I am being falsely accused by my enemies. I</p>
<p>Started Serving as an Official at the age of twenty-two. I was assigned to southern Hunan as a probationary magistrate. I worked in the military and political circles for more than 30 years, and I held important positions in the President's cabinet and the State Council. Last year, due to the communist rebellion, I came to Shanghai to live. I myself was threatened. How could I be a kidnapper? But I was arrested in Beijing</p>
<p>Because an enemy borrowed money. Five hundred yuan were not repaid, and he reported me. Last year, my whole family was arrested. Monk Bao Hong, Zhang Guanxia, Wang Jinsheng, and others handled it, and 10,000 yuan were used. This year, another 3,500 yuan was used. I demand that they return it because my eldest son is currently studying at the China Public School and will need to start a family in the future. My youngest son is only four years old this year and also needs to live. If I am wronged,</p>
<p>Then My Sons and Grandsons will be shot like me. After saying this, tears fell like rain. At this point, the judge ordered the execution. Police Chief Xu directed the execution police officers to take Shuai Songping down for execution by firing squad. After the inspectors verified the death, they ordered the hall to receive the body and wait for family members to claim it.</p>
<h3>Former San Francisco Vice Consul Gao Ying Released After Serving Sentence</h3>

<h3>Eight Russians Conspire to Kidnap Sofa</h3>
<p>Russians Had Long Planned the Kidnapping; Extortion Letter Already Written; Sofa Personally Appeared in Court Yesterday; Judge Questioned Separately</p>
<p>Eight Russians, namely Pei Wu Luofu, Lai Kangmu Jin, Mei Keyingfu, Kai Xuelai Shi, Qin Bo Fu, Pei Qi Lao Fu, Tie Wei Ke Fu, and Lu Kai Luofu (hereinafter referred to as the nth defendant in the order of the above names), conspired to kidnap the Jewish tycoon Sofa for ransom but failed. Detective Mei Sheng and Russian Detective Sha Tuola of the General Police Station investigated the case and arrested Pei et al. and handed them over to the First Special Court for trial and detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. At 2 p.m. yesterday, Criminal Court President Xu Jiashi and Court Clerk took their seats in the First Criminal Court to continue the trial. Lawyer Ru Baoyi represented the plaintiff Sofa, Lawyer Lei Shengbu represented the plaintiff, and Lawyers Shi Zhuoren et al. defended the defendants. Jiang Baoliang was appointed by the police as the interpreter for the case. Lawyer Ru, representing the police, stated that the police were prosecuting the first to eighth defendants for the crime of attempted kidnapping for ransom under Article 371, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, and for conspiring to kidnap for ransom under Article 370 of the same law. The plaintiff lives at No. 4 Bailinan Road. Every day at 5 p.m., a girlfriend visits him, and at 8 p.m., the plaintiff personally sends her home. The plaintiff always returns home no later than 11 p.m., almost every day. The defendants planned to kidnap the plaintiff one or two months ago. They knew that the plaintiff had considerable wealth and that they could get at least 500,000 yuan in ransom if they kidnapped him. The case was solved because an accomplice of the defendants informed the police. However, the surname of the informant (commonly known as the "eyeliner") cannot be announced now, for fear of revenge by the defendants. Now, I will briefly describe the defendants' plan and the circumstances of the case. In early August of this year, the third defendant told the informant that they wanted to kidnap Sofa and asked the informant to join them. The informant did not agree or disagree at the time. A month later, the third defendant again went to the informant and said that the matter had been completely arranged and that they were about to take action, but they still lacked someone who could drive. Knowing that the informant was good at driving, they asked him to join and asked for a definite answer. The informant learned of this and reported it to the police. On September 19, the informant, according to the third defendant's notification, learned that they intended to carry out the kidnapping on September 21 and found out that the first defendant was also an accomplice. He reported it to the police again, but by September 21, the defendants could not carry out the plan because the procedures were not complete. They decided to change it to September 22. The police notified Sofa and told him not to go out on September 22, so the defendants still could not achieve their goal. However, on the night of September 22, the plaintiff's friend Aishuxike Si, after leaving the plaintiff's home, saw a red-bearded man, namely the second defendant, loitering there, looking suspicious. Later, the police learned that the defendants had agreed to meet in the Russian restaurant at No. 518 Xiafei Road on September 25 because the matter had not been successful. They then joined forces with French police detectives and arrested the first defendant at 5:15 p.m. that afternoon. After he confessed, they arrested the second defendant at No. 728 Xiafei Road. A small booklet with numbers written on it was found on him, and the plaintiff's car number, 849, was also among them. At the same time, an unopened letter was found in his luggage. The letter was addressed to the plaintiff. After the police opened the letter, it turned out to be an extortion letter to the plaintiff's brother. On September 25, the third defendant was arrested at No. 345 Xiafei Road. A rope and a key were found on him. The key was to open the back door of No. 235 Gansidong Road, which was the place prepared to hide the kidnapped victim. There were no other houses on either side of the house, one side facing the road and the other facing wasteland, making it an excellent place to hide the kidnapped victim. At the time, two pistols, eleven bullets, a thin rope, and two pairs of black glasses covered with green paper were found in the house. After the third defendant confessed, the fourth defendant was also arrested. The fourth defendant was the owner of the Russian restaurant at No. 518 Xiafei Road. When he was arrested, a pistol and twenty bullets were found on him. According to the first defendant's confession, the fourth defendant was the leader of the case, and the pistols in No. 235 Gansidong Road were also placed in that house by the fourth defendant through the fifth defendant. The extortion letter was drafted by the first and fifth defendants together, and then Xue Limen translated it into English (Xue has now been arrested in Tianjin and will be brought to Shanghai soon). The police obtained a confession and arrested the fifth defendant, confiscating a book with faint words on it. After the police enlarged and examined it, it turned out to be the Russian original of the extortion letter. However, the plaintiff had another plan, that is, before starting to kidnap the plaintiff, they would first use a small Citroen car with the number 1434 to block the plaintiff's car so that it could not move forward, and then start the kidnapping. The car belonged to the sixth and seventh defendants. The police then arrested the sixth and seventh defendants. As for the eighth defendant's arrest, it was because he acted as an informant for the gang, specializing in delivering messages. Today, the plaintiff and witnesses are in court and should be questioned." Then, witnesses Aishuxike Si and plaintiff Sofa gave their testimony. Judge Xu then ordered the defendants to be questioned separately. He first asked the first defendant whether the confession in the police station was his own handwriting. The defendant answered yes and directly admitted all the points stated by the police lawyer. By this time, it was already dusk. Judge Xu then ordered that the trial be adjourned to another day and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Japanese Tear Down Slogans on North Sichuan Road</h3>
<p>At around 10:30 last night, about 20 Japanese were spotted near the Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road, walking south along the road and tearing down slogans posted on both sides of the shops. They were dispersed by the police at the intersection of Qiujiang Road. It was also reported that five or six marines followed behind the Japanese at the time.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiusheng Bigamy Case</h3>
<p>Trial Held at Special District Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Witnesses Not Credible, All Released on Bail</p>
<p>Yu Qiusheng, the owner of the Dade Rubber Factory, falsely claimed that his wife had died and colluded with his friend Xu Kuiqing from Ningbo to persuade Wang Pan, a Shaoxing woman living in Siwen Lane, Da Tong Road, Xinzha, to marry her 17-year-old daughter Qiaoxian to Yu as his second wife. The woman did not know it was a trick and ordered her eldest son-in-law, Feng Xilin, to act as the matchmaker. All the betrothal and engagement procedures were followed according to the old customs. On July 23, Yu pretended that the New World Hotel was a wedding hall and welcomed the bride with a decorated car. A civil wedding ceremony was held, and they went to the new house in Tongde Lane, Zilai Street, French Concession. After living there for only three days, Yu induced the bride to go to the home of his wife on Zhangchuan Road in the city, pointing to his wife as his sister. At night, Yu slept with the so-called sister and ignored the bride. Later, Qiaoxian found out that she had been deceived but was already trapped and could not escape. By the time she was in confinement, Wang Pan went to see this lucky son-in-law and learned the whole story. She took her daughter back and reported it to the police. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the police, based on the crime of bigamy, filed a public prosecution against Yu Qiusheng. The last time the First Special District Local Court held a hearing, Yu hired a lawyer to deny the marriage at the New World Hotel and claimed that Yu had filed a lawsuit against Wang Qiaoxian in the Second Special District Local Court for absconding, requesting that the case be merged into the Second Special Court for trial. Judge Feng Shide ordered the defendant to pay a bail of 2,000 yuan and wait for the wedding location to be clarified before resolving the jurisdiction issue. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng held another hearing. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the police stated that all the employees of the New World Hotel and Hongxiang Hotel and the matchmakers from both sides had been summoned and should be questioned. The court then questioned Wang Yunbao and others in detail about the use of the hotel's auditorium by the defendant on July 23. Wang et al. gave extremely evasive answers. After repeated questioning, they hesitantly claimed that Yu Qiusheng was taking a concubine and said that apart from lighting candles in the hall, there were no other actions. When the bride arrived, she bowed to Yu. The court asked why there were red candles burning if it was just a banquet. They claimed that it was Yu's ancestor worship. When asked about the fees listed on the bill for the doorman and patrolmen, what was their purpose? Wang et al. replied that it was a reward from the guests. Therefore, the testimony of these people was largely unreasonable. Judge Feng then questioned the matchmaker Xu Kuiqing about the process of matchmaking. Xu was even more evasive. At that time, the lawyer representing the defendant presented a piece of evidence written on red paper that was neither a marriage certificate nor a contract of sale. Xu Kuiqing claimed that this was the contract between the two parties, but the lawyers for the police and the plaintiff all claimed that there was indeed a formal marriage certificate, with each party holding their respective documents, which had been presented to the court earlier. What the defendant presented now had never been seen before. Then, Feng Bolin, the matchmaker for the woman's family, testified that the defendant actually claimed that his wife had passed away, so he was marrying a second wife. Xu Kuiqing also said the same thing. The defendant paid 520 yuan in betrothal gifts, of which 200 yuan was for dowry, 200 yuan for clothing, and the remaining 120 yuan for wedding cakes. When the plaintiff left her home, the defendant used a decorated car and a military band to pick her up from the Hongxiang Hotel to the New World Hotel. Xu Kuiqing acted as the master of ceremonies during the ceremony. All of this was witnessed. How could it be concealed? On that day, the hotel not only set up the auditorium, but also placed tall lanterns at the entrance. If it wasn't a wedding, what was it? The court then asked Chen, who had arrived from the Hongxiang Hotel, who was also very evasive. When the defendant was questioned about who wrote the red paper presented to the court, the defendant initially claimed that he had asked someone in his law firm to write it, but after the lawyer denied it, he claimed that the person who wrote it was surnamed Zheng, but he did not know the address. There were many loopholes in his words. Judge Feng and the prosecutor in court paid more attention. Finally, lawyer Wang Yaotang of the police stated that according to the plaintiff's representative lawyer, the testimony given by the witness from the Hongxiang Hotel today was completely different from what he had said at the lawyer's office before. Other testimonies were even more predictable. This was indeed due to the changes after the defendant was released on bail. However, to prevent him from destroying evidence again, please increase the amount of the defendant's bail. Judge Feng then ordered that the case be adjourned to another day for further hearing. Xu Kuiqing and Wang Yunbao were both suspected of perjury and were ordered to pay bail and await investigation.</p>
<h3>News of Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Western Officials Come to China to Assist in Epidemic Prevention</p>
<p>The Dalu Bao reported that the Dutch East Indies government has sent two medical officers and one trainee, carrying a large amount of epidemic prevention medicines, to China to assist in disaster relief and epidemic prevention work in the Yangtze River basin. They have departed on the Chibada ship and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on Sunday. In addition, Dr. Barker, director of the Eastern Health Division of the International League, arrived in Shanghai on Monday and visited various departments of the National Seaport Quarantine Station. Yesterday, he also inspected the Wusong Quarantine Station.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Volunteer Relief Society Inspects Disaster Situation in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Gaoyou Breach Needs to be Blocked Urgently</p>
<p>Massive Project; Relief Funds Insufficient</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Yinjiang of the Chinese and Foreign Volunteer Relief Society, accompanied by Pastor He (Presbyterian Church of Taixian), Mr. Gu Jisheng, Mr. Wang Junsheng, and others, personally went to northern Jiangsu to inspect the flood situation in various places and the relief work of various branches. Mr. Zhu et al. traveled by car to Zhenjiang and then hired a small steamer to go to the Yangzhou branch first. They have been working hard these days, distributing flour and cotton clothes, giving priority to the most needy. However, the disaster area is surprisingly large, the number of victims is surprisingly high, and the source of flour and cotton clothes is limited, which makes the distribution feel insufficient. Then, Mr. Zhu et al. took a steamer to Gaoyou. The floodwaters there have receded compared to when the breach first occurred, but the counties in the lower reaches are still a vast expanse of water. Mr. Zhu et al. climbed the east and west dikes to inspect, and the largest breach was 70 to 80 zhang wide. The sound of the surging waves was incessant. In Gaoyou North Gate alone, there are eight or nine breaches of various sizes. The water flow is very rapid. Eighty to ninety percent of the houses in the area have collapsed completely. The severity of the disaster is heartbreaking. At present, the disaster relief efforts need urgent relief of food and clothing on the one hand to save the dying victims, and on the other hand, they should carry out work relief, that is, blocking the breaches to curb the flood. Because the terrain there is low-lying, now that there is a breach, the water from the canal is pouring into the farmland. If we do not urgently seek to block the breach, the water势 will dry up, then the area along the canal will inevitably suffer from drought next spring. When the water rises in summer and autumn, the gates will be wide open, and they will still suffer from floods. Therefore, millions of people in the nine counties downstream of the canal have nowhere to escape death. Therefore, the breach blocking project cannot be delayed any longer. However, the project is massive and cannot be completed without a large amount of money, and the society's strength is limited, still feeling like a drop in the bucket. Without generous and benevolent people quickly donating huge sums of money, there is no way to start the project. After inspecting, Mr. Zhu et al. returned after visiting the disaster areas in various places. He has now arrived in Shanghai and will report the inspection situation to the society. He is currently planning how to raise funds and how to carry out urgent relief work.</p>
<h3>Meeting Minutes of the Provincial Flood Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Flood Relief Association for Various Provinces held its twelfth standing committee meeting at 4 p.m. yesterday. The attendees were Xu Shiying, Mao Youfeng, Huang Hanzhi, Chen Bogang, Wu Zhihao, Qu Wenliu, Yu Zhiang, Hu Mengjia, Zhu Ziqiao, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Zhao Youqin, Wen Lanting, Qiu Wenbo, Jin Guanfu, Huang Bodu, Zhang Gongquan, Wang Yiting, and representatives of the Jiangxi Flood Relief Association Hu Siyi, Lu Fang, Wang Mingxuan, Gong Yihong, etc. Xu Shiying was publicly elected as chairman, and Yang Yun recorded the minutes. First, the chairman reported the amount of relief funds and relief goods received and spent, and the number of letters and telegrams received and sent. The following is a record of the issues discussed: (1) A letter from Hu Siyi et al., representatives of the Jiangxi Flood Relief Association, stated that the province had suffered three floods, and more than 20 counties along the river and lake were flooded. They were deeply grateful for the repeated allocations of funds, but the Zhou Fang and his committee only distributed funds to four counties, and many were left out. Should the relief funds be increased? It was decided to allocate 20,000 yuan, and the rest would be allocated by the National Government Relief Committee. (2) A letter from Director Zhu Ziqiao stated that purchasing old clothes was more convenient than manufacturing new clothes. However, it seemed that the old clothes were not enough to keep the old and weak warm. Should new clothes be prepared and how much should be allocated for purchasing old clothes and manufacturing new clothes for preparation? It was decided to prepare 220,000 yuan and manufacture 100,000 sets of new clothes. (3) A letter from Xiang Shicheng, director of the Medical Team, reported that a total of 6,248.5 yuan had been raised, and the value of medicines issued by the Wuzhou Pharmacy was 6,735.83 yuan, leaving a balance of 487.33 yuan paid in advance. He also attached various receipts. How should this be verified and written off? It was decided to complete the procedures for purchasing medicines with the donated funds. (4) A letter from the Zhenwu Society stated that the Yunnan Zhaotong Disaster Relief Association for the 874 flood had sent a true telegram stating that the flood in Zhaotong was severe and asking for relief. Should funds be allocated? It was decided to temporarily reserve the matter and discuss it again after verifying the authenticity of the telegram. (5) Xu, the chairman, forwarded a letter from Qiu Wenbo, the Guizhou representative stationed in Beijing, and attached a winter telegram from the Guizhou Zhenwu Association, stating that the disaster in the province was severe, but the government ignored it. He asked for quick relief with earnest words. Should additional funds be allocated? Qiu Wenbo explained the severity of the disaster and the relief measures. It was decided to allocate 100,000 yuan for relief. It was decided to allocate 10,000 yuan first, and the rest would be discussed after the Guizhou Provincial Government sent a telegram directly. (6) A letter from the Anhui Flood Relief Association in Shanghai stated that the disaster area in the province was vast, and there were many victims. Winter relief was urgent, and they asked to allocate 200,000 sets of cotton clothes first. It was decided to allocate the 2,342 pieces of clothing, 34 cotton quilts, and 302 pairs of shoes, hats, and socks stored in the association to the Anhui Flood Relief Association for distribution. (7) A telegram from Xu Guozhi, a member of the Anhui Relief Committee, stated that Yang Jianquan, a member of the Huaining Relief Committee, had reported the situation and stated that there were many victims in Shipai, Huaining County. Various groups requested that several thousand yuan be allocated urgently to set up a porridge factory, which would be ten thousand times more meritorious than distributing urgent relief. Was this feasible? It was decided to telegram Xu Guozhi to submit specific measures and report them for verification. Finally, Zhao Youqin, a Hunan relief worker, reported on the disaster relief situation in Hunan Province. The meeting adjourned at about 7 p.m.</p>
<h3>Production of Winter Clothes for Disaster Victims Begins Under Supervision</h3>
<p>Approximately 10,000 Sets Can Be Produced Daily</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Government Flood Relief Committee, considering that deep autumn was approaching in an instant, the weather was cold and windy, and the disaster victims had no clothes to protect themselves and were in danger of freezing and starving, ordered the procurement section of the committee to rush to produce 1.2 million sets of cotton clothes and transport them to the disaster area for distribution. Huang Renlin, the chief of the section, and Gao Dajing, the deputy chief, actively prepared after receiving the order. Because bidding to buy from merchants would be too expensive, they borrowed a section of land from the Commercial Press behind the Yongan Stack on Songgong Road in Zhabei in the city and built a temporary factory to recruit workers to make clothes. The fabrics used were all supplied at reduced prices by various cloth factories in the city, and experienced personnel were sent to Shandong to purchase cotton. Now that various procedures have been gradually deployed properly, the raw materials have also been prepared, and the official start date is the 16th of this month. They will rush to make clothes day and night, and it is estimated that about 10,000 sets of cotton clothes can be produced every day. The disaster victims, who were shivering, can smile a little at this news.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Flood Relief Association News</h3>
<p>Truly Meeting the Needs of Disaster Victims' Lives</p>
<p>The civil affairs department is located north of Gaoyou. The breach at Gaoyou caused the floodwaters to rise to Baoying, turning the entire area into a watery expanse. Currently, the floodwaters in Gaoyou have not receded, and those in Baoying have not receded as a result. Recently, the association received a "Complete Account of the Baoying Flood Disaster" from a resident of Baoying, which included a section on the post-disaster situation. An excerpt is provided below to illustrate the suffering of the people of Baoying: (Excerpt Omitted) The entire county borders Xuyi to the west, Tianchang to the southwest, Huaiyin to the northwest, Yancheng to the east, Xinghua to the southeast, Sheyang Lake to the northeast, Gaoyou to the south, and Huaian to the north. Except for the embankments added to all four sides of the county seat (the southeastern city wall is already submerged), it is all a vast, flat lake, with waves rising even without wind, making it impossible for small boats to travel. Local boatmen cannot recognize their way home. The water depth ranges from two to three *zhang* deep to eight or nine *chi* in shallower areas. As of the end of last month, the water still had not receded. In various villages and towns, on high mounds and embankments, disaster victims share living space with snakes and rats. Defecation, urination, spitting, and dirt create a filthy mess. People die daily, and many are thrown into the water. In Sunjia Dongyi Village in the western district, about fifty *li* from the city, dozens to hundreds of houses have been destroyed. The people have died and floated away, impossible to find. However, there are many large trees, and thousands of snakes of various kinds and colors hang from their branches. People warn each other not to approach them. Songgang in Huajiacheng outside the east city (commonly known as Wutongdun) is the highest point in the entire county, covering an area of several *li* around. It contains hundreds of millions of ancient tombs and used to have no residents. Now, tens of thousands of refugee families from various villages have fled here, each occupying a space no larger than a mat. They are suffering from hunger and cold, and epidemics are spreading, causing constant deaths. In the areas near the eastern district's lakes, many people tie their small boats to house foundations and trees. Refugees on the higher wheat fields temporarily live on planks erected in the forks of large trees. Despite enduring hunger and cold, they refuse to abandon the collapsed houses, wooden debris, and broken furniture in the water. Despite much persuasion, they stubbornly stay. In the four districts of east, west, south, and north, various elevated mounds serve as settlements where disaster victims live together. The water around them is a multicolored mess and emits a foul odor. Furthermore, farmland is submerged, and the rice in the water rots, also emitting a foul odor after prolonged soaking. Disaster victims eat and drink here, and people often die from bloating and stomach pain. Corpses are found floating side-by-side on the water's surface east and west of the Grand Canal, some tied together with ropes in groups of dozens, others bound together with towels in groups of three to five. Some mothers carry their children on their backs, wives pull their husbands, elder brothers hold their younger brothers, and elder sisters pull their younger sisters, with two children clinging to each other. The male corpses, both old and young, carry packages, hold tightly to metal boxes, hide food inside their clothes, or carry miscellaneous items on their backs. The sight is shocking and indescribable. Disaster victims exposed to wind, rain, stars, and dew initially still attempted to swim and salvage unripe or half-ripe rice, pounding it into a paste to share. Now, this has been exhausted, and the weather is gradually turning cold. The number of starving people increases daily. (Excerpt Omitted)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Urgent Relief Association Raises Funds to Make Clothes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-based Jiangxi Urgent Relief Association held a meeting yesterday, attended by Chen Guangfu, Zheng Jianhui, Wei Ruifeng, Sun Fuji, Wang Peiyuan, Wu Zhihao, Li Shuhe, Wen Wen Lantao, Wang Yiting, and more than ten others. Wang Peiyuan reported that the Bank of China had already remitted 100,000 yuan to Jiangxi. After reporting the amount of donations received this week, they began discussions. Everyone agreed that the weather was getting colder, and the disaster victims had no clothes, so how could they survive the winter? It was decided to quickly raise donations to prepare for making and distributing clothes for relief.</p>
<h3>Baoshan County Government Dispatches Personnel to Relieve Sand-Dwelling People Outside the Mouth [of the River]</h3>
<p>The National Government's Flood Relief Commission recently dispatched Cen Jiaolin to Bao[shan] to investigate the disaster situation. County Magistrate Zhao and the district chiefs jointly conducted the inspection and found that the county had raised more than 1,700 yuan since launching the flood relief donation drive, and staff from various agencies had deducted a total of more than 1,000 yuan from their salaries. Together, this amount was used to purchase 200 *shi* of rice, which arrived at the county government yesterday morning. Qian Yaonian, the chief of the public security section, and Wang Qingtao, the chief of the first district, went to various sand-dwelling areas outside the mouth [of the river] to distribute 120 *shi* of rice. The remaining 80 *shi* were allocated according to the severity of the disaster in each district. Furthermore, following a provincial order to solicit clothing, more than 5,000 items have been collected. It is planned to transport half of them to the sand-dwelling areas for distribution and to send the other half to the provincial government for redistribution to Jiangbei.</p>
<h3>Chinese Women's Association Raises Funds for Flood Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Women's Association held a meeting on the 7th of this month at the residences of Mrs. Zheng Xiangheng, the president of the association, and Mrs. Huang Hanchang to raise funds for flood relief. At that time, 600 silver dollars were donated. It was also decided to hold a welcome party for new members at the Shanghai Bank conference room at 4 p.m. on the 19th of this month. In addition to reporting on the progress of the fundraising efforts and discussing its use, Mr. Sun Huaxin, who had recently returned from the Northeast, was invited to speak on the Northeast issue.</p>
<h3>Anhui People Organize the Guiding the Huai River Advancement Association</h3>
<p>The National Government's Guiding the Huai River Commission has completed its surveying work. In light of this year's Huai River flooding, construction can no longer be delayed and is scheduled to begin in November. The plan to direct the river into the [Yangtze] River has been changed to directing it into the sea. The Anhui Native Place Association in this city believes that the Huai River runs through the entire northern part of Anhui and is more closely related to it than to Henan upstream or Jiangsu downstream. They have been researching this issue for many years. The association's executive committee members Wang Baozhai, Lu Chewu, Jiang Zhifu, and Wang Zhuru invited fellow Anhui natives from various counties along the Huai River residing in Shanghai and Chen Ziheng, Yang Yaonan, Li Zhuxi, and other representatives from northern Anhui seeking relief to exchange views at the Central Restaurant. More than 50 fellow natives from Fuyang, Fengyang, Lingbi, Wuhe, Shouxian, Huoqiu, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, Yingshang, Xuyi, Sixian, Haozhou, Dingyuan, Suxian, Guoyang, Taihe, and Tianchang counties attended. Wang Zhuru first gave a speech expressing sympathy to the relief representatives from northern Anhui and asked for their guidance. Next, the northern Anhui representatives reported on the disastrous state of the floods and their contact with the National Government's Relief Commission, native place associations, and various charitable organizations for relief. Wang Baozhai then reported on the Anhui Native Place Association's fundraising, relief efforts, and allocation of funds to various counties throughout the province. Hong Zhenjiu, Wang Songzhai, Chen Ziheng, Li Zhuxi, Wang Lantian, Jiang Zhifu, Yang Yaonan, Shi Yunpu, Niu Yuqiao, Liao Yuanqiao, and others then expressed their opinions. After discussion, everyone agreed that guiding the Huai River was a fundamental plan and that work-based relief was extremely important. It was decided to publicly invite the Anhui Native Place Association in Shanghai to organize the Anhui Guiding the Huai River Advancement Association in accordance with the provisions of the association's charter regarding special committees, to advise the government, and to point out the advantages and disadvantages. The entire group passed the motion with applause, and Wang Songzhai was publicly elected to draft the charter. The Native Place Association will soon convene a joint meeting of the entire board of directors, executive committee, and supervisors to decide on the organization.</p>
<h3>Wusong Establishes a Fishing Boat Inspection Office</h3>
<p>Preventing the Intrusion of Japanese Fishing Boats</p>
<p>The fishermen of Wusong Harbor reported that Japanese fishing boats were increasingly intruding [into Chinese waters] and that there were collusions with unscrupulous merchants to smuggle fish products into the country. In order to prevent the intrusion of foreign boats into Chinese waters and promote the development of domestic fishing industries, they specially obtained approval from the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau to establish a fishing boat inspection office at the Penglai Public Hall on Wusong Wai Ma Road to begin inspecting all imported fishing boats and strictly prevent unscrupulous merchants from smuggling in goods, thereby protecting fishing rights. Yesterday, they also sent notices to the various water and land authorities to inform them of this.</p>
<h3>The Financial Community Maintains Bond Prices</h3>
<p>Allowing Interest Payment Discount for Three Months</p>
<p>Implementation Expected Soon</p>
<p>Since the occupation of Manchuria by the violent Japanese, the bond market has been greatly unsettled. Although the financial community has made every effort to remedy the situation, the market situation has expanded, making it difficult to take action immediately. According to reliable sources in the financial community yesterday, the recent willingness to make loans against Treasury bonds to the greatest extent possible has been quite effective in maintaining bond prices. It is now planned to take a further step to maintain prices by allowing a three-month discount on the spot prices of various Treasury bonds, based on the face value of the bonds and the interest due. For example, for this month, the principal and interest for October, November, December, and March can be discounted and repaid in advance. This will strengthen the credit of Treasury bonds and calm people's minds in the market. After all parties have agreed to this measure, it is expected to be implemented soon.</p>

<h3>Ren Zhennan's Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>Audience Prohibited</p>
<p>The case of lawyer Ren Zhennan, who was accused of indecent assault by his wife Jiang Xingjuan, was heard yesterday by Judge Qian of the Criminal Division of the District Court. Because the case involved public morals, the audience was prohibited. Ren Zhennan was first questioned about the accusations of bestiality, etc., and said that they were absolutely false. He also stated that he had returned from Guangdong and submitted a statement on the 8th and was detained on the 9th. He originally wanted to surrender himself and requested bail. However, Jiang Xingjuan still insisted that her husband had forcibly committed bestiality. The judge adjourned the court because further hearings were required and ordered Ren to be taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>Employee Savings Refunded by Two Railways</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Employee Endowment Savings Association has been established for six years. The original method was that each employee voluntarily deducted a certain percentage of their monthly salary, and at the same time, the railway bureau contributed the same amount, which was deposited in the bank to earn interest. Now, because the lives of the railway employees are becoming increasingly difficult, they submitted a joint letter to the Savings Association in early July, requesting that half of each person's total deposit be refunded. This was approved and submitted to the railway bureau. The railway bureau believed that the matter concerned the public welfare of the employees of the two railways and specially forwarded it to the Ministry of Railways for instructions. It is now learned that it has been approved, but only for this time. It is said that other methods will be determined later.</p>
<h3>Siamese Newspaper Mogul Visits This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Chen Shumu, the president and editor-in-chief of the Siamese Chen Zhong Daily, and Qiu Guoji, the editor, returned to China to go to Beijing to consult with the authorities on newspaper affairs. They returned to Shanghai yesterday. On the evening of the 15th, they visited this newspaper. Mr. Wang Xilian of this newspaper led them on a tour of the various departments. It is heard that Mr. Chen and others plan to take a ship to Hong Kong on the 19th and then go to Siam.</p>
<h3>Cheng Linsheng of the Citizens' First District Branch Sends a Letter</h3>
<p>Handling the Order to Take Back the Rented Houses in Yixin Lane</p>
<p>The Citizens' First District Branch sent a letter to Cheng Linsheng regarding the forced eviction of houses in Yixin Lane, which stated: "Dear Sir, we have received a statement from our members, Rongchangxiang Company, etc., stating that they have been unreasonably ordered to vacate the houses they are renting from you in the Nanjing Road area and are requesting assistance. Our association has discussed this matter and believes that the shops in the Nanjing Road area have huge capital and many employees, which are important to the market in this city. If landlords are allowed to exert pressure and force evictions, and others follow suit, the impact would be profound. For the sake of the public interest, our association has decided to send a letter to you requesting that you withdraw the order. Otherwise, you should be responsible for the public's anger. Moreover, at a time when the national crisis is intensifying, all citizens are planning to unite to resist foreign aggression. We hope that you will not rely on your economic power to arbitrarily oppress the tenants and engage in internal strife. This letter is sent to you accordingly, and we hope that you will investigate it." Addressed to Mr. Cheng Linsheng of the Gongyi Syndicate.</p>
<h3>Modern Photo Studio Fires Japanese Employees</h3>
<p>The Modern Photo Studio, located across from the Datong Hotel on Nanjing Road, opened on the 20th of last month. People from all walks of life have been flocking there to have their photos taken. Recently, because Japanese soldiers forcibly occupied our Northeast and the whole country is outraged, advocating for a complete economic boycott, the studio resolutely fired the Japanese photographers it had previously hired and hired specialized domestic talent to take over.</p>
<h3>Xu Qian to Practice Law in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Jilong plans to practice law in Shanghai and has been issued a certificate by the Ministry of Judicial Administration. He will soon join the Lawyers' Association and partner with the two major lawyers Dong Chi and Du Yuesheng to set up a law firm at No. 39 Avenue Edward VII and a branch office at No. 107 Bowling Green, Nanjing Road. The lawyers recruited by the law firm, such as Wang Jian, former president of the Jiangsu High Court, Zhang Bingyun (Bingjun), Ouyang Yi, and others, are all outstanding talents of their time.</p>
<h3>Daxin Silk and Satin Store Specializes in Fashionable Women's Coats</h3>
<p>Daxin Silk and Satin Store, located at the corner of Shilu and Sanma Road, is still in the midst of its one-week anniversary sale. The various domestic silk and satin fabrics recently purchased by the store have already sold out. Fortunately, new goods continue to arrive, which can meet the needs of all walks of life. This phenomenon is the good result of the continuous boycott of inferior goods. If all circles can persist in this, domestic silk and satin will surely restore their former glory in the shortest possible time. Recently, the store realized that women's coats will be very popular in the coming winter, so they specially hired various masters to conduct careful research. They have now made various thick and thin women's coats with novel styles, which have a "modern" feel. And the prices are very cheap. Every day, dozens of ladies and daughters come to order them.</p>
<h3>China-America Department Store Opens Yesterday</h3>
<p>The China-America Department Store, located at the intersection of Avenue Foch and West Xinqiao, opened yesterday. Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, and members of the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association successively sent congratulations. Manager Hu Yunfei greeted them cordially. There was loud music and the hosts and guests were happy. The store was crowded and the male and female staff were overwhelmed. By about 3 p.m., the business volume exceeded 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bao Fang Records Sells Records at a Loss</h3>
<p>Bao Fang Company on Dongxinqiao, Avenue Edward VII, recently shipped in thousands of new records of various kinds from Baidai, Gaoting, Beikai, Kaiming, etc. In order to benefit customers, they are selling the above records at a loss. The Baidai song and dance records are especially popular with all walks of life because each record only sells for six cents.</p>
<h3>News from Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Refining Industry: The Refining Industry Trade Association convened a general meeting to discuss anti-Japanese work and decided to: (1) establish a Japanese goods inspection team, which will immediately investigate and seal up [Japanese goods] at various members and report to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association; (2) actively carry out investigation teams, because the industry has recently learned of many pro-Japanese silk merchants and raw material firms that mix Japanese goods with goods from other countries. They plan to give them a warning first and give them a chance to reform. If they still do not wake up, they will deal with them by extraordinary means. Rubber Industry: In order to thoroughly boycott enemy goods and get to the bottom of the problem, the Rubber Industry Trade Association convened a raw materials preparation committee yesterday, which elected Su Gongxuan as the chairman, and Yang Yongnian and Shi Zhishan as the vice chairmen, to be responsible for carrying out the raw material manufacturing. The factory will be named Shanghai Rubber Raw Materials Chemical Factory so that all kinds of chemicals can be completely self-sufficient in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Special Announcement</p>
<h3>Boycotting Japanese Goods Is Not Difficult at All (Zhongxia)</h3>
<p>As long as there are practical methods</p>
<p>The academic and industrial circles of the whole country should rise up</p>
<p>In the clamor for economic severance with Japan, there is one point that I would like to ask everyone to recognize: not buying Japanese goods is an extremely easy thing, it does not require your sacrifice, it does not require you to suffer, as long as you have a little conscience that can still get angry, everyone rise up, organize a permanent group, set a few practical and feasible methods, there is no reason why boycotting Japanese goods will not succeed. Some people in society even declare that China's production of immature domestic goods cannot be self-sufficient and is not worthy of boycotting Japanese goods. Everyone should not believe this nonsense. Boycotting Japanese goods means not using Japanese goods, not not using all foreign goods. Not buying Japanese goods can mean buying Chinese, British, American, German, Indian goods. Just taking cotton cloth and sugar, two kinds of Japanese goods, they already account for four-tenths of Japan's imports. If you don't use Japanese cloth, can't you use Chinese cloth or American cloth? If you don't eat Japanese sugar, can't you eat Chinese sugar or Javanese sugar? Boycotting Japanese goods is a means of national retaliation. As long as it can give Japan a heavy blow, everything else can be ignored. China's exports to Japan are mostly raw materials, and China's imports from Japan are mostly consumer goods. According to customs statistics, the major items that China imports from Japan are not needed for production, and their value is as follows (unit: 1,000 Customs Taels):</p>
<p>Year 18 (Japan, Taiwan, Korea) Percentage</p>
<p>Cotton cloth and cotton products 1,112,968 32.9</p>
<p>Hemp, silk, wool products and miscellaneous piece goods 13,426 3.95</p>
<p>Sugar 22,403 6.6</p>
<p>Flour 16,777 4.8</p>
<p>Fish and seafood 11,278 3.35</p>
<p>Paper 13,071 3.86</p>
<p>Clothing and hats 5,327 1.57</p>

<p>According to this table, Japanese goods that are unrelated to production account for seven-tenths of all Japanese imports. Even if these seven-tenths of the source are completely cut off, it can be said that it has no impact on the Chinese economy. Among these kinds of goods, please tell me, which one is absolutely indispensable and cannot be done without Japanese goods, and which one does not have domestic or other foreign substitutes? The remaining three-tenths are mostly raw materials, machinery, or supplies for production, such as cotton, cotton yarn, metal materials and minerals, coal, wood, chemical products, machinery, etc., and it is not necessarily that there is no room to eliminate Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Year 18 Input value of Japan, Taiwan, and Korea accounted for% of Japanese goods. Cotton 14,414 4.25</p>
<p>Cotton yarn 1,843 1.72</p>
<p>Metal materials and minerals 14,425 4.25</p>
<p>Coal 10,387 3.05</p>

<p>Total 70,481 20.75</p>
<p>Paper is said to be a raw material, but it can also be said to be a finished product. The main use of paper is, of course, for printing books and newspapers. Books and newspapers do not compete with foreign goods, and within the country, the selling price and sales volume have nothing to do with each other. If a certain bookstore or newspaper does not use Japanese goods, but uses a second-rate foreign paper, or uses a more expensive foreign paper, it can be said that it has no impact on business. Books and newspapers each have their own content and their own sales scope, which cannot be affected by slight price differences. Therefore, I have listed paper together with other purely consumer goods. In fact, the price difference between Japanese and Western paper is extremely limited. In July and August this year, Daolin paper from Japan was 0.45% cheaper than Western paper, and newspaper paper from Japan was 3.8% to 7.6% cheaper. Paper originally only accounts for a part of the cost of books and newspapers, and this little difference is really insignificant. There must be similar situations in other raw materials. It is not that there are no suitable substitutes, but because of the slight price difference, the sales of this country's goods are encroached upon by that country. These slight differences, under the drastic changes in exchange rates in recent years, are simply nothing. If, in addition to the seven-tenths (consumer goods and paper) mentioned above, there are substitutes for raw materials, and the prices of the substitutes are not far apart, we can say that at least eight-tenths of Japanese goods can be completely eliminated without harming the Chinese economy. If there are still people who say that China must rely on Japan and is not worthy of boycotting Japanese goods, he must be talking nonsense with his eyes closed. I say that not buying Japanese goods is extremely easy, does not require sacrifice, and does not require suffering. Now, please ask yourself, is there any point in not buying Japanese goods that is truly difficult for you? If you don't wear Japanese cloth, people without money can wear Chinese cloth, and those who have money and love beauty can wear British cloth. No one is telling you to wear less clothes, and no one is forcing you to spend more money. It doesn't matter if the clothing material is a little worse, it's not that comfortable, but wearing cloth from Japanese enemies on your body is not that decent. If you don't eat Japanese refined sugar, you can eat second-rate Javanese sugar. The taste is similar and the price is even cheaper. If you must have refined sugar, there are also other foreign goods (accounting for 30% of refined sugar imports in 1930), and the price is not much more expensive. Flour imported from North America has always exceeded that from Japan (2.2 times that of Japan in 1930), and the price is the same. The paper has already been said above, and it is absolutely no problem. Fish and seafood are even more dispensable. If there are a few less of these dishes at a banquet, can't you put down your chopsticks? These few Japanese goods, all kinds of textiles, sugar, flour, fish and seafood, paper, already account for 56% of Japanese imports. What about other items such as clothing, hats, porcelain, enamel, glassware, rubber, rubber boots and shoes, cosmetics, fruits, etc.? Please tell me, which one does not have a domestic or Western substitute? You can choose expensive or cheap ones as you like. If the source of these Japanese goods is completely cut off, we can still live as usual without feeling any pain at all. When a country is invaded by an enemy, as a rule, all able-bodied men in the country should die on the battlefield, and the elderly, weak, women and children should tighten their belts and work hard in the rear. The whole country should unite and fight to the death with the enemy. Now we are not telling you to go to war, we are not telling you to tighten your belts, and we are not restricting your material enjoyment. What we are asking of the people is very simple and very easy. As long as everyone recognizes Japanese goods and is determined not to buy Japanese goods, this is not a sacrifice, but can only be said to be a kind of inconvenience. If even this point is not willing to do, and you buy Japanese goods carelessly, what face does our nation have to survive in the world? What face do we have to protest to Japan and complain to all countries in the world? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Mr. Ma Chunbiao's Letter (What to do with old Japanese goods?)</h3>
<p>I am a small clerk with a meager income. I am constrained by my family situation and have extreme economic difficulties. I often panic, so I have developed the habit of being greedy for cheap things. In the past, the clothes and daily necessities I bought were only the cheap goods, regardless of whether they were Eastern or Western goods. Now I am awakened, awakened to Japan's barbarism and violence, and I am determined not to buy Japanese goods, but most of the clothes and supplies I have are Japanese goods. According to my heart, I am very willing to discard them, but if I want to re-prepare domestic goods one by one, I am limited by my economy and really have no ability to re-prepare them. If I still wear and use them, I feel ashamed. Sometimes I promote the boycott of Japanese goods to others, but that person says, "You can't even boycott them yourself, but you want to persuade others." Sir, I am definitely not a "cold-blooded animal," and I am definitely not "dead at heart." Now I want to solve this problem so that I can comfort the uneasiness in my heart and avoid external criticism and be able to persuade others to boycott Japanese goods. Please instruct me. It is best to answer in the newspaper, because there must be other compatriots who suffer the same pain as me.</p>
<p>(Reply) Of course, there is no need to discard the old Japanese goods, but in order to encourage others and lead by example, it is best not to use them. You should still express yourself within the scope you can have.</p>
<h3>Mr. Watanabe Masafumi's Letter</h3>
<p>(Japanese youth asks for opinions on the anti-Japanese movement.)</p>
<p>I am a Japanese youth living in Shanghai. I always have a sincere intention of friendship with your country. However, everyone has different opinions. I am deeply sorry for this unfortunate East Province incident. I especially cannot understand the students' strikes and participation in various movements. Now I am sending a letter to ask you to take the trouble to use your knowledge as a reporter to inform me of the meaning of the anti-Japanese movement of the students of the universities representing Shanghai.</p>
<p>(Reply) As far as we know, there is no anti-Japanese movement among the students of various schools. However, they encourage each other and encourage each other not to buy Japanese goods. Their opinion is nothing more than hoping that all the people of your country, especially the youth of your country, will warn the warlords of your country to wake up quickly and not to do such inhuman, uncivilized, and outrageous work to the whole world, so as to avoid future regrets. The perpetrators are your warlords, and those who suffer from the commercial depression and are ridiculed by the whole world are your people. Do young people with ideas feel willing?</p>

<h3>Letters Received</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I have read in today's news column of your newspaper that this law firm has purchased seven or eight mu of private land on Hongqiao Road, which is not true. This law firm has not entrusted anyone to represent us in contacting or purchasing the land mentioned above. We understand that the rumors are untrue. We hereby send a special letter to inform you and hope that you will check and correct it so as not to confuse the hearing. We will be grateful. Sincerely, to the Shenbao newspaper, Murakami Law Office, Murakami/Fujii/Lawyer.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I was surprised to see in the Shanghai column of your newspaper a news item about Japanese lawyers buying land, which involves me. Since the Japanese invaded our Northeast, all Chinese people have been furious. Although I am foolish, how dare I do this? Moreover, foreigners must first apply to the Municipal Land Bureau for approval before they can lease land. If the report is true, the Land Bureau should have a record to check. It seems that it is not difficult to get to the bottom of it. This matter concerns my reputation. I hereby make a Zheng Tong statement and hope that you will correct it. Sincerely, to the chief writer of the Shenbao newspaper, Zhang Qinpu, October 15th.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I was horrified to see in today's news column of your newspaper that I was "selling our country's land as a Japanese lawyer." I know nothing about this matter and it is a fabrication. As for the matter of digging up graves and selling land, although someone reported it, involving me, the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office investigated and ruled not to prosecute the case. It is intentionally confusing and it is obvious that someone is fabricating rumors and maliciously slandering me from it. This matter concerns my reputation. In addition to investigating and prosecuting the case separately, I hereby sincerely request you to give a correction to show the facts and avoid false accusations. Sincerely, to the chief writer of the Shenbao newspaper, Zhu Youren, October 15th.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, There are five things that must be stated regarding the news item in your newspaper yesterday about the marriage dispute between Yu Qiusheng and Yu Huang Qiaoxian: (1) Yu Qiusheng sued Huang Qiaoxian for absconding, and Huang Qiaoxian has filed a lawsuit against the original trial court of the Second Special District for false accusation. (2) Huang Qiaoxian and her mother have been living at No. 201, Siwenli, Datong Road for two years. The reason for claiming that there is no address this time is to deceive the court (there is evidence to prove it). (3) Huang Qiaoxian's bail was paid by our lawyer on behalf of our client, ready to be summoned at any time. (4) Yu Qiusheng's ex-wife, Ms. Chen, lives at No. 16, Zhangchuan Lane, Xinbeimen (that is, Yu's residence). Zilai Street Tongdeli is the address of Yu Qiusheng's Hong Kong Tiancheng Company and is not the address of Tu Zhi (there is a factual confession for investigation). (5) Huang Qiaoxian sued Yu Qiusheng for bigamy. In addition to the previous court hearing, Yu Qiusheng was released on bail of 2,000 yuan. Yesterday, Yu's matchmaker Xu Kuiqing and the New World Hotel clerk Li were ordered to pay a substantial security deposit. Because there is suspicion of false accusation, our lawyer hereby declares a correction for the sake of protecting Huang Qiaoxian's reputation and requests that it be published in the letters column of your newspaper so as not to confuse the society. Therefore, I am grateful. Please write to the chief writer of the Shenbao newspaper, An, Yu Huang Qiaoxian/Agent Lawyer Wang Kanghou, October 15th.</p>

<p>Book and Magazine Introduction</p>
<p>New Era Monthly, Qiu Guoji</p>
<p>I remember a writer who gave Zheng Liyun a copy of his newly published collection of short stories, and wrote on the cover, "Please critique and introduce it." Her response was, "To get a book and then have to critique and introduce it, isn't that too much of a bad deal?" No writer has ever sent me a book, so naturally I don't have Liyun's attitude that "To get a book and then have to critique and introduce it" is a "bad deal." I paid the price of one corner and five cents in silver to buy a copy of the New Era Monthly. For special research purposes, I have neglected literary works entirely for several years, and I haven't wielded my pen for critiques in just as long. This time, however, it has rekindled my love for literature, and I'm starting up the furnace again to give the New Era Monthly a critique.</p>
<p>What is the position of the New Era Monthly? In other words, what mission does it bear? We cannot speculate about this ourselves. Fortunately, the editor of the journal has already spoken very frankly in the "A Few Casual Words" on the front page of the inaugural issue. He said, "The New Era Monthly is a purely literary monthly. It has no political background and does not discuss any "-isms." In other words, it is a publication that "does not discuss politics" and "has no -isms." The mission of the New Era Monthly also includes the task of promoting "unknown writers." Let's continue reading the "A Few Casual Words" by the editor of the journal.</p>
<p>"The editor... hopes that "unknown writers" will submit works constructed with their heart and blood to this journal. The editor is sincerely and humbly waiting. I believe that what a famous writer casually writes may not necessarily be better than a work that an "unknown writer" has carefully conceived and diligently created. This journal wants to become a shared garden for friends who love literature, and will definitely not, like other publications, refuse to publish manuscripts from non-celebrities. We are willing to do everything in our power to introduce "unknown writers" with literary genius. Our greatest joy and glory is the discovery of writers."</p>
<p>From this, it seems that the mission of the New Era Monthly is undoubtedly to promote unknown writers. Originally, established writers came from the stage of being "unknown writers." Unknown writers, if they are willing to work hard, can become famous writers. Conversely, established writers, if they are unwilling to continue working hard, will also fall into the field of the unknown.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can summarize that the New Era Monthly stands on the position of elucidating literature and promoting unknown writers.</p>
<p>The New Era Monthly, inaugural issue, second issue, and third issue, have been continuously published monthly. In terms of history, it is naturally not permissible to say that it already has a long history. In terms of essence, it may not be called a "big shot" just yet, but the fact that it has been published successively up to the third issue is also a commendable thing. Moreover, the fact that it can be published on schedule every month, without the problem of frequent delays like other domestic magazines and monthlies, is even more of a matter that can set the tone for the domestic publishing industry.</p>
<p>Now we can review the contents of the recently published third issue of the New Era Monthly.</p>
<p>The first three articles are texts with critical commentary qualities.</p>
<p>(1) Hua Lin's In Memory of Qu Yuan, (2) Mao Yibo's translation of Theory of Folk Art, (3) Shen Congwen's Preface to Autumn's Decline. These three authors are recognized by the people as established writers. Hua Lin is considered a seasoned writer.</p>
<p>1. In Memory of Qu Yuan is a short and incisive text. The author believes that Qu Yuan and Dante have many similar attitudes, but are different from Shakespeare. His insight is,</p>
<p>"One seeks ideals from reality, and the other seeks reality from ideals. In fact, the real world is hell. People full of passion often beautify everything with ideals."</p>
<p>2. Theory of Folk Art is a slightly longer translated article. The translator has already had a considerable position in the Chinese literary world. His translation is very delicate and faithful.</p>
<p>We can imagine how much the translator hates exploiters who obtain things without labor, and conversely, how much he sympathizes with laborers who live off their own work, in the translator's special selection of this Theory of Folk Art to translate.</p>
<p>3. Preface to Autumn's Decline is originally a preface that borrows the name of a celebrity to decorate the facade. We can regard it as not worthy of high praise, but this preface by Shen Congwen does not praise the author. There are a few admonishing words that can greatly encourage young writers:</p>
<p>"Creation does not require intelligence and agility, but it cannot lack a bit of sincere and lasting confidence... Our works are all immature, but that is okay. Only our belief can make our works strong."</p>
<p>Young people who aspire to create, don't be discouraged! As long as you work hard and persevere, you will have abundant harvests. Next are some translated novels. Let me also mention three representative works to talk about them.</p>
<p>1. Ba Jin's translation of The Death of a Mother, Ba Jin is an established writer. His translations can also achieve the state of being faithful, elegant, and expressive. The author of The Death of a Mother is Herzen. This is a tragic novel depicting a shipwreck. We see,</p>
<p>"We arrived at Ye'er at night. I immediately went to the police station. A police officer accompanied by an inspector took me to the port officials first. He had all kinds of salvaged items there... We also went to the hospital... Several others told me that they saw an old lady, a five-year-old child, and a young man with a beautiful beard... They were with these three people until the end when everyone lost consciousness. In this way, these three people also sank to the bottom of the sea like everyone else. However, I couldn't help but have doubts. How could these people be rescued? In fact, they, like Easy and her servant, were completely unaware of how they were rescued.</p>
<p>The salvaged corpses were placed in a Buddhist temple's mortuary. We went there from the hospital... In the mortuary, there was a row of covered boxes, each box containing a corpse. The police officer told people to open the boxes... Every time a box was opened, he would speak in an official tone and ask, "Do you admit in front of us that you do not recognize this corpse?" We went to the second box... I couldn't find one...</p>
<p>My mother, my Koliya, our good Spiman were wiped out without leaving a trace. None of their belongings were left. Their deaths were beyond doubt.</p>
<p>What a tragic picture this is. I think this article is very similar to Xiao E's "Tragedy at Sea." 2. Zeng Jinke's After Life is Settled, the author is good at writing romance novels. In this article, he once again shows his specialty in writing romance novels. Let's see,</p>
<p>"In the past two years, a beautiful young woman fell in love with him and had an actual love relationship. She even intended to divorce her husband and marry him. In addition, there was also a lovely girl who loved him and did not hesitate to offer him her virginity, hoping to be with him for life. He also wanted to transform his family, because he did not lack this opportunity, but he could not bear to abandon his original wife, and was willing to sacrifice his infinite happiness. On this point, it proves that he is a very moral young man."</p>
<p>3. Peng Chenghui's Dead Man on the Train Tracks, this is a novel with a factual background. The protagonist of this article, Xiuming, is Zhao Boshun, a Jinan student who committed suicide near the Zhenru Station of the Huning Railway. This novel is divided into two parts. I especially like to see how he received the bad news that his lover had abandoned him in the first part.</p>
<p>"He woke up this morning and received a letter from a friend in the South Island, reporting that his lover had changed her mind and fell in love with someone else. This unprovoked flood destroyed the river of happiness he wanted to cross, and this unprovoked storm collapsed the ladder of happiness he was prepared to climb. How could he not feel heartbroken?"</p>
<p>I especially love to see the description of his tense and tragic state before going to the gates of hell in the second part.</p>
<p>"He slowly went to the side of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and sat on a patch of grass near the iron bridge. He gazed at the stream flowing slowly. He ate peanuts and drank beer. At this time, scenes of the past overlapped and surged into his sad heart. Rolling hot tears flowed in front of his eyes in bursts.</p>
<p>"Ah, your towering science museum, your solemn dormitory, your ancient classroom, your lush jungle, goodbye, goodbye!</p>
<p>"Ah, my dear classmates, my respected teachers, and my alma mater, my lovely elementary school students, goodbye, goodbye!</p>
<p>"Ah, Xueqing, you who once loved me and abandoned me, I hope you are always happy. I wish you eternal happiness. I will pray to God in heaven and ask God to always bestow you with light and beauty!</p>
<p>"Ah, my parents who are thousands of miles away, leaning on the door and looking forward to my return, your dear son is going to step into another beautiful world on this moonlit night. After you receive such news, you may not need to be sad, you may not need to be heartbroken, because the world your son is stepping into is forever happy and blissful. I will have no pain or annoyance there. Dear parents, I hereby wish you eternal spirit and health, and your jade bodies will always be healthy!</p>
<p>The rumbling sound of the wheels turning has gradually become clear. A tragic smile overflowed on his pale and thin face. Then he gently, calmly, and peacefully lay across the railroad tracks.</p>
<p>By the time he entered another world, a fish-belly white light was appearing on the earth."</p>
<p>According to the author's statement, "This article is entirely written by EMagination. To write a novel, you must have at least these three elements: first, Fact, second, EMagination, third, Description. The reason why I like this novel can be said to be because it has these three elements. Some crudely made writers often have the first element, but lack the second and third elements."</p>
<p>The contents of the New Era Monthly, next are nine selections of poems. I don't know if the vernacular of the flowing water "flowers, moon, lovers" is good or bad. This is exactly my lack of Sensibility to new poetry, perhaps because the popular new poetry itself lacks content. I like to read several of the collected poems here, especially Zheng Lihen's "Opening Up." Let me introduce a section from the middle of it:</p>
<p>"At this moment,</p>
<p>The beginning of war,</p>
<p>The cries of killing rise all around,</p>
<p>Friends,</p>
<p>Why hesitate, be indecisive?</p>
<p>Quickly prepare our weapons,</p>
<p>The great power of the new era,</p>
<p>Finally inspires us to move forward,</p>
<p>Let us savor the meaning of life,</p>
<p>From the struggle."</p>
<p>Although she is not yet a female poet, she is more of a theoretical writer. This poem of hers also does not have the arrangement of form and syllables, which is exactly its beauty. The reason why I love to read it is still because of its jumping Vitality.</p>
<p>In addition, there is Zhang Ruogu's essay Foot of Fumiko by Junichiro Tanizaki. Zhang's writing style is concise and unadorned, and readers have already had a good impression. I don't need to praise it here.</p>
<p>Finally, the New Era Monthly has two sections for literary news and readers' opinions. I think these two unnecessary tails are unnecessary (Daily newspapers and weekly magazines can have this method). Because the thirty-two pieces of news like the literary news are just the daily life notes of domestic writers. However, the actions of writers are different every day and every week. Moreover, a monthly magazine with only thirty-two pieces of writers' news is pitifully small. It would be better if this column could be changed to publish some meaningful world literary news.</p>
<p>As for readers' opinions, they are especially unnecessary, because each reader has his or her own personality, each reader has his or her own environment, and at the same time, each reader has his or her own opinions. It is not possible to fully accommodate their different opinions, nor can one force people to agree with some published readers' opinions. Therefore, I believe that readers should have their own spontaneous thoughts and opinions, and there is no need to publish them.</p>
<p>There are many other shortcomings, such as many misspelled words, especially the English mistakes are a complete mess. I hope to correct them in the next issue. In general, the New Era Monthly is a publication worth buying.</p>
