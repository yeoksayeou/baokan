<p>時評</p>
<h3>暴日攻錦發動</h3>
<p>自國聯第三次草草休會以來今又瞬經旬日調查團之人選尚未確定而暴日攻我錦州之軍隊則已正式發動。國聯一二三次集會之鄭重决議竟三次爲日人所一手撕碎國聯究將何以自處。吾人固無暇代爲籌謀。更不必向之責問獨是吾國處此情勢之下究將如何决定其應付之方策。此爲當前最嚴重最切迫之問題。萬民仰望。一致切盼政府能作一確切具體之解答國聯第三次草草休會。對於東北問題僅成立一不痛不癢之决議。是可證其不爲無能即爲對日人之暴行。予以默契决不因我之呼籲請求而能主張公道。予暴日以實力上之裁制而如英記者賴斯摩氏所揭發。則更謂東北事件之爆發。爲國際間之一大陰謀國聯之延宕敷衍。乃其預定之計劃賴斯摩氏并指明此陰謀分爲五階段首則預料我國無力自衛必向國聯乞援第二步乃由白里安佯作表同情於我國在國聯故意通過警告日本撤兵之决議。而日本則堅持根本五點拒絶撤兵國聯復出種種延宕政策俾日本鞏固其地位及軍事準備果如賴斯摩所言。則國際間詭秘詐諞之黑幕。今已明白揭開我國日處於列國陰謀外交家政治家暗算之下。而不自覺東北禍變。即爲若輩所造成。今後。顧尚有再向國際呼籲乞援之餘地耶。</p>
<p>自我國内政局發生變動以來。國人多移其對外之目標轉而對内甚且認爲東北問題已告一段落陷落之半壁河山已爲旣成事實終將無法收回此一觀念實爲大錯。實爲誤國。今日之情勢。實較過去倍爲嚴重。日本内閣更迭。政友會重新登台犬養内閣發表對滿方針决貫澈田中政策。日某報對於芳澤外交之推測。亦謂芳澤必能取中日外交之長而不取其短。能剛能柔。田中之積極與幣原之消極都兼而有之不但於滿洲問題澈底下手。即對華一切問題必取斷然之决心。是則犬養内閣之對華外交將愈益强硬化。將愈益變本加厲一新其帝國主義猙獰面目蓋毫無可疑而法報對於芳澤之任外長。則都加美評謂芳澤爲具有最穩健觀念之外交家。在國聯行政會處理滿洲爭端運極難談判中表示極廣大之温和精神。國際之態度。亦就可推知其一斑是可知今日之情勢。已更趨於儼重艱難。其謂東北問題已告一段落者。不僅不智實爲苟安嗚呼在貫澈田中對華政策之行動下。我國即不圖收回失地。即竭力忍耐退讓。以博得一時之苟安。又豈能得耶。</p>
<p>今暴軍已正式發動攻我錦州矣其在我遼吉亦已準備設置總督。直視我東北爲朝鮮之續矣今日之事。我國不爲對日宣戰而爲自衛。我全國人民所要求於政府者亦非爲對日宣戰而爲自衛就事實理論任何一方面而言。在今日嚴重情勢之下。萬不容再持鎭靜再向國際乞憐。即萬不容再不抵抗再不作正當之自衛。民氣激昂運月以來之奔走追呼。都即爲此。我政府今日究將何如。終始不抵抗耶。抑奮起以圖自衛耶。萬民仰望。實不勝其疑慮惶惑與焦思。</p>
<p>日人室伏高信對於東北事件之觀察。謂東北事件。縱令中國在滿洲有何等損失。而對於中國全體確爲一刺激確爲一機會確爲一警戒。中國其或因此而免除内部之危險乎。誠然。以東北事件之爆發。使我國内甯粤之爭持得以解决。和平統一之局。幾經波折得以勉强告成。然迄至今日。汪精衛與胡漢民兩氏。仍稱在疾不入京。所謂十委問題。又成爲一中全會進行之障礙。其已到京之中委。則又將忙於職位之分配。人員之安插。對於救亡大計。尚多無暇注意。外患迫在眉睫而國内仍不免於爭持。吾人不能不認當局尚未能接受東北禍變之警戒。尚未能接受東北禍變之刺激。同時更尚未能牢握以外患之刺激。而加緊内部團結之機會。環顧山河。黯淡無光。茫茫前途。我民族究將安適耶。</p>

<p>敎育消息　特載</p>
<h3>暴日積極侵略中小學校敎育設施上應有的改進（續）（吳增芥）</h3>
<p>要使兒童有救國的實力、那末小學敎育的設施上、必須注下列幾點、</p>
<p>一、切實施行　康敎育兒童的身體尚未發達完全在這時期、必須注重健康、「健全的精神寓於健全的身體一是一句很有價值的格言、健康敎育、也不是敎師口頭說說、衛生的重要、和請些衛生故事或開個運動會就可濟事的、切實辦法如下</p>
<p>（一）多設置可以强健身的器具　這是指游戲器具、運動器具而言的、學校裏的經費、無論拮据到何種田地、游戲和運動的設備、必須購置、因爲有了器具、才可以刺激兒童引起游戲和運動的　味、</p>
<p>（二）與家庭切實聯絡注重兒童的營養營養對於身體的健康是很重要的事敎師應和家長切實聯絡、注重兒童的飮食起居、</p>
<p>（三）多行體格檢杳和健康檢查健康敎育的目的、積極方面、是要兒童的身體强健消極方面、是要兒童没有疾病、并有抵抗疾病的能力、兒童的身體、究竟好不好、應常常加以檢查、如發現有不良現象、隨即設法救治或通知家長設法</p>
<p>（四）切實施行童子軍訓練照中央公佈的義勇軍敎育綱領中小學校要組織童子義勇軍、查童子軍是種很好的訓練方法不但可以訓練身體、還可養成良好的道德童子軍活動中、如露宿游泳等等、都是一種很好的鍛鍊身體的方法、日本的學校裏、有「斷食」訓鍊野戰訓練等、實在是很好的訓練方法我們雖不必這樣但童子軍活動、必須切實施行、</p>
<p>（五）運動要注重普遍不注重奇才小學校裏開起運動會來往往注重挑選選手、而不注重於數量的多少、實在是一個錯誤、要知道運動一事人人都須注意學校所以提倡運動不是要養成運動家、而是要使兒童都能鍛鍊身體、小學裏的運動、尤須顧到兒童發展的程度否則、往往因運動而損害身體、</p>
<p>二養成用手用腦的習慣要國家富强必須增加生産小學校的兒童當然談不到生産的技能、但是必須打　生産的基礎、要打定這個基礎、必須使兒童有用手用腦的習慣、常常用腦、就是常常思考、常常用手就是能實地去做、關於這一點、又可分成下列各點說、</p>
<p>（一）養成兒童研究科學的興趣小學校裏應注重自然科學的敎授、以養兒童愛好自然、研究自然、并能利用自然改造環境、</p>
<p>（二）注重試騐和實地觀察兒童由實地的試騐和觀察所獲得的知識、才是眞切的自然科的敎學、不能　憑口頭講授、應多使兒童親自試騐養成兒童探求眞理、和察觀研究的態度自然科上的　器樣本和體育科上的運動游戲器具、是同樣的重要所以學校經費無論困難到怎樣田地自然科上必不可少的儀器、標本、非置辦不可、</p>
<p>三、養成吃苦耐勞的精神兒童身體强健了、自然能夠吃苦耐勞小學校裏有許多工作、如果兒童能力可以做得的不妨讓兒童去做學校裏以少用校工爲原則平時學校裏人部分工作都雇用校工做的兒童僅輪流做值日生而已、這似乎嫌少、自有改革的必要、</p>
<p>除了以上所說三點以外、還須切實施行下面的　樁事情、</p>
<p>四、辦兒童報兒童從閱讀或聽講所得知識、不會有很深刻的印象、而且不會感到興味、所以要利用圖畫把日本的暴行、以及救國的種種做的工作、用圖畫表示出來、這種兒童報、每隔三天發行一次由敎師編輯、兒童也負投稿之責、</p>
<p>五多行公共會集會的訓練團體生活的訓練、也是當務之責、小學校應多舉行集會訓練以養成兒童守時、重紀律的習慣、這種習慣養成之後、將來到社會上去是守法的公民、升入中等學校、也就是遵守團體規律的良好分子、</p>
<p>抗日救國的工作正多、辦理小學敎育的同志們、今後對於兒童、不要專做灘輸知　的工作、而是要培養兒童種救國的實力實力是什麽、就是、一强健的身體（二）用手用腦的習慣、（三）吃苦耐勞的精神、願大家努力、（寫於省立蘇州女子中學校）（完）</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>明嘉靖間。倭冦屢犯無錫。縣知事王其勤禦敵事實。已詳載無遺。友人賀天健錫人也。爲述當時錫　東門外二十里顧家村。有顧眺泉父子者。膂力過人。耕田時嫌牛行遲緩。挾牛往返。如抱嬰孩。站立門檻上。腰東　嗶。使十餘壯男子。併力拉繩。不爲動。村人奉爲武士道之秦斗焉。會倭冦至。屠殺鄉村。雞犬不留。顧父子憤甚。暗集流亡之夫百餘人。揭于　倭。横刀陷陣。血染鬚眉。倭冦之被殺者。不知凡幾。倭酋欲　而甘心。調集勁旅。屢戰不利。甚至倭奴視顧家村爲畏途。繼甘顧家村周圍二十里内。倭冦亦不敢至。翌歲倭仇顧益深。乃大集部隊二千餘人。圍攻十日。而盡屠顧家村男女百餘人。顧父子身受重傷。尚大呼瞋目而前。手刄倭冦十餘人。迨被俘。駡不絶口。倭酋以刄刺顧目。父子同日殉難。與近時蔡公時之被害。如出一轍。倭奴之慘無人道。蓋不自今日始也。</p>

<h3>甘地先生敷衍法國人（上）</h3>
<p>甘地先生回印度，走法國經過，對法國人說：</p>
<p>『我這次到英國來，雙手空空，一無所得！貴國人對於自由，平等，博愛之箴言，能說能行，不勝欽佩……』</p>
<p>這種話出於普通政客之嘴也没有什麽希奇，可是出於甘地先生之嘴，就未免令人有些失望。</p>
<p>甘地先生說這話的時候，可曾爲世界被法國壓迫之六千萬人設身處地想一想？</p>
<p>法國是現今世界第二大的殖民帝國，擁有殖民地三十處，總面積一千二百萬平方　，總人口一萬萬人。從一八八○年至一八九○年法國在亞洲得了六萬方哩，在非洲得了一百萬方哩：從一八九○年至一九○○年在亞洲得了三萬方哩，在非洲得了三十萬方哩：從一九○○年至一九二○年非洲得了一百三十餘萬方哩。這隻殖民的老虎，嘴兒還是開得大大的在等候食。</p>
<p>帝國主義之法蘭西是不恤用暴力奪取殖民地。爲要取得阿爾及利亞它是與阿拉伯君長戰了三十年。得勝之後，法人便佔有沿海極肥的農田，葡萄園，橄欖林，把士人驅逐到邊遠的瘠地上去。</p>
<p>法國佔領赤道非洲之故事更慘。它把領土之半分散給四十個公司，同時禁止土著出賣橡皮且强迫土人納一定的貨稅給公司。土人抵抗則殘殺：屈服做工則如牛馬般用鞭打，懶惰的手脚常被砍斷。公司中人練習手槍甚至於用土人做活靶子。到了一九一九年。法政府才下令使土人在耕田，畜牧，打獵的權利上得到一部份之保障。</p>
<h3>犬養毅艶語</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>犬養毅。號木堂。岡山縣人。性疎狂不覊。家綦貧。薪儲不給。距今五十年前二十七歲時。曾有一段艶事。足資談助。岡山縣可眞町内。有一妓院。曰豐崎樓。中有名妓艶吉者。年二十許。芳姿綽約。時人稱爲崗山花。趨之者若騖。一日。艶吉外出。犬養適遇諸途。見其媚麗若仙。國色無雙。不禁迷眩亟趨過之。固詰姓名里居。女實以告。犬養歸憶容華。欽想成疾。翌日。詣豐崎樓。樓主濱某覩其衣敝踵决。拒不納。犬養情急生智曰余與艶吉有姻表親。樓主信以爲眞。導之入。及見女。班荆略談。意甚欵洽。女亦優</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>近世界的奇人一人獸奇觀」TraderHorn這部小說。早已傳誦歐美。自好萊塢攝製成了電影以後。更名震世界。而作者是怎樣一個人。却没有人知道。他住在英國瑟來府Surrey的中心。周圍數英里以内的人民。都喚他做「紙傑克」PaperJack而不知道他的眞姓名。他留着一部長髯。飄拂胸前。他的頭髮也長長的。垂在兩個肩上。他的衣服。是用棕色的紙做的。將一根繩子縛在他那魁偉的身體上。無論寒暑陰晴他總過着露天的生活。所住屋子不過是一間小小的木屋。他不吸烟。不飮酒。每天只吃一些兒棕色的麵包。他曾對人說。「今年我大約是五十八歲了。我已忘却了年月。不知是也不是。十年以來。我從不睡在牀上。也從没有信札或帳單的來往。從没有對鐘錶看一看。而夜間大半是睡在星斗之下。」據知道他身世的說。他本是倫敦一位富商之子。曾研習商等數學。曾得到測量師的學位。曾有一段鐵路由他打過樣。不料青年時代。害了風濕病。忽然復發起來半身不遂。醫生無法可想。他也早已生趣索然。在無可奈何之中。便决意自行和大自然去接近。把太陽和空氣來治療他。果然得到驚人的效騐。他現在已力大如牛。健康非常了。</p>
<p>禮逾常。曰。妾所以愛君者。爲百年非爲今夕。君如有心愛妾。願託燕婉。何必絮絮乃爾。犬養嘉納之。翌晨欲去。沾沾依戀。不忍遽别。抱而慰之曰。卿緩待。余當設法藏之金屋。自是三數日輙一過從。會有鄉友高木。爲庭瀨町之富豪。得其賂遺。思欲娶之。顧女父性頗頑固。鄙其寒賤事遂不諧。犬養鬱鬱不自得。然暇必往尋舊好。至則闔扉狂飮。狎褻備至。未一月。欠負纍纍。樓主恶之。富豪高木以其揮霍無度。譴責之曰。前以君爲才器。今君竟以黄白物填彼青樓之婦墟。殊失所望。犬養至是。韜悔前行。向高木求得最後二百金。以償宿逋自此以後絶跡章台。後艶吉以凄戀成疾。奄然物化。犬養聞之。悼痛欲絶。今犬養年已七十有七。人或叩以艶吉事輙曰。我負斯人矣。此係前豐崎樓樓主現居高砂町荒川屋之濱某所緬述。揭於大阪朝日新聞者。</p>
<h3>呵凍雜記</h3>
<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>天寒地凍。冷意逼人。吾輩埋首於文字堆中者。斗室枯坐。倍覺無聊。醮墨則硯池冰結。握管則膚僵欲裂。惟心有所感。總覺吐之爲快。爰呵凍拉雜述之。客有操文王術者。戲談今日之時事曰。革命軍抵定中原後。遷都南京。稱最高之行政機關曰中央。中央者。屬土。而日本三島。地居東海之濱。國人稱之曰東洋。東方屬木。五行中木能尅土故中央之在國聯。每爲東京所挫也。默察其言。頗足玩味。又曰。中　之出席國聯代表爲施肇基。基下屬土。日本之出席國聯代表爲芳澤。芳頭屬丱草猶木也。故揆諸木尅土之說。亦殊暗合。抑何巧也。</p>
<p>小白龍者。一股匪耳。初無籍籍名。自新民皇姑屯之役。騙得日軍餉械。與日一戰後。報紙宣傳。譽爲匪中之俠。說者且有龍馬並稱。龍即小白龍。馬乃孤軍抗日之馬占山將軍也。語云。一念可流芳百世。一念可遺臭萬年。傳奇中常有名臣之後。流爲匪盜。終得招撫。爲國勤勞者。如小白龍其人。殆亦深受舊說部之薰陶。有激而成者也。</p>
<p>一昨之夕。訪文友勗齋主人。主人出其家乘。中載其世祖郭泰定者。明末人。時倭冦來侵官軍征之不克。冦勢益張。泰定本孔武有力。慄悍善戰。乃招集勇土數十人。陷賊陣。泰定單騎奮進。斬賊十餘人。砍其首懸之馬後。纍纍若穿珠然。少</p>
<h3>高君珊歐美歸來話國難（五）</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>國弱到這步出地。外交旣不能佔勝利。武力又不足以禦侮。我們難道已走到絶路。没有什麽法子可以補救嗎。我想在現今狀况之下。至少還有兩樁事。我們應當立刻去努力進行。這就是國際宣傳。與抵制日貨。每次中日發生糾紛。日本能夠得到國際的同情。就是因爲他們有充分的。有力的。永久的宣傳工作。日本政府每年花了一大筆欵子。專做此項工作。就是滿蒙的問題。在美國書報雜誌上。時時有日人的文字。論日本如何需要滿蒙。及滿蒙歸了日本的管理以後。一切事業。將要如何發達。這種論調。在各國的書報上。都能見到。所以他們這次侵略東北。不是驟然而來的事情。是早具决心。早有準備。早在各國散佈空氣了。祗有我們中國人。如醉如夢的睡在鼓裏。這次出兵東三省的時候。起初各國輿論。還肯主持公道。到了後來。又漸漸傾向於日本的單方面。而尤以法美兩國的報紙爲甚。自十月十八以來的紐約時報。請大家讀一讀看就可以知道了。不但一般報界如此。就是素稱爲對華親善的孟祿博士。在哥侖比亞大學上課的時候。曾有兩次說。「這一次糾紛。是中國對不住日本。因爲中國不遵守條約的緣故。（據哥校同學來信所述。）我們想想。日本的宣傳工夫。多少厲害。竟然可以掩盡天下人的耳目了。據十二月二十日時事新報載「大阪外國語學校學生。組織滿蒙研究班。先編成一小册子。題爲滿蒙事變之性質與日本之地位。譯成外國語。分寄世界十三國之各新聞雜誌社。又迻譯全國對東省事件之愛國運動。分寄世界各國。從事宣傳。」我們試看日本已經處處占勝利。還一步不肯放鬆的。在做國際宣傳的工作呢。這是何等可怕的事呀。</p>
<p>返觀我國。事事不如人。被人欺侮到如此盡頭。還不敢哼一聲。事實上旣已吃虧。連國際的同情都得不到。聽說日本曾將中國反日的行動。計五百件。丨丨當然大部份是杜撰的丨丨製成清册。提到國聯去。日本對華之暴行。事旣慘酷。而次數當不止五百。上海第三區黨部所出版的「日本對華陰謀與暴行。」據稱截至十九年底止。已有四百三十三件之多。若將外部檔案細查一下。遺漏的還不知多少。我們有這許多的事實。爲什麽默默不作聲。讓人家去信口雌黄呢。如果被人打還不知喊痛。就被打死。也不足惜了。</p>
<p>時。冦益衆。泰定乃疾馳而回。冦復率衆來襲。泰定方躍馬渡河。不料馬以載重力疲墮於河爲冦所獲。斬之。後人誌其功績。爲建泰定橋。塑像與張巡同祀。</p>
<h3>出征</h3>
<p>— 青年援馬團一團員</p>
<p>（五）離崑山</p>
<p>蘇州素以女子美麗冠於全國。兼之虎邱名勝也是數一數二的好所在。我羨慕這佳人與美景已很久了。現在果然到了目的地。使我如何的愉快呵。</p>
<p>今午（十二日）我們别了歡送的崑山民衆。一齊乘車到了蘇州。站上候迎的人們。比崑山要多上十幾倍。我們由歡迎代表引導至中華大旅社安歇。旅社的主人給我們十多個大房間。不收房錢。他那愛國熱忱。可算是資本家的模範。膳食由東吳學生供給。我們自問也很過意不去。</p>
<p>十三日上午。我們接受各界代表及學生們的美意。在公共體育塲開歡迎會。所有演詞。均極悲壯沉痛。聽者動容。會畢遊行。觀衆萬人空巷。</p>
<p>在蘇州。除了幾條繁盛市街之外。其他道路。都是很狹窄的。屋字也不甚高。言語多用土音。隨處都可以聽得温馨細軟的蘇州話。我們外省人初到這裏。耳鼓頓爲之一新。</p>
<p>昨晚在崑山時。忽然吹起了大北風。到現在還没有停止。幾乎把耳朶也吹了下來。眞是厲害喲但我們反覺得欣喜。因爲這塲大風。也許是從黑龍江吹來給我們嘗試的。</p>

<p>第五章血沙塲喋</p>
<p>在彭梅國軍隊出動之後。忽然有一列車太陽軍開到Ｔ城來。名爲保僑及防護鐵路實在已佔據了Ｔ城。可憐Ｔ城中的百姓。受盡太陽軍荼毒。太陽軍的團長金龜十三郎。傲睨自若。專候前方的捷報。不料警耗傳來。方知彭梅國已被其女和一個愛國大學的學生姓華的所殺。現在軍隊已歸姓華的統轄。重又豎起青天白日旗。要來奪回Ｔ城。這裏派去指揮的十數名軍官。一半已被擒殺。其餘的人逃回。報告這個消息。Ｔ城居民聽了。一齊暗暗歡喜。但那金龜十三郎却怒不可遏。立即率領兩個太陽兵聯隊。以及騎兵砲兵。開到前方去堵殺。原來華乃强誅了彭梅國。　到明晨。方始發表。梅國屍身由忠淑備棺收殮。暫且掘地而葬。華乃强即召集各軍訓話。軍隊中初聞到這個消息。無不吃驚。但是後來知道忠淑大義滅親。熱心愛國。更兼華乃强向他們慷慨激烈的演說了一番。大家都有些感動。所以無人反對。華乃强又明言願意相隨殺賊的留此。其餘悉聽自便。這麽一來。散去了三分之一。留下的都是精兵。大家爲愛國心所激動。推戴華乃强爲司令。一致服從。華乃强早已把太陽國的軍官殺去了數人。其餘已四走。華乃强他估料太陽軍得到這個消息。必不肯干休。又探知Ｔ城已被太陽軍佔領。遂吩咐手下軍隊回攻Ｔ城。不料在半途上遇見了太陽軍。華乃强便請忠淑率領一軍。和太陽軍正面交綏。戰至一二點鐘的時候。可以緩緩退却。引誘太陽軍追來。又請砲兵營長任遠。督領砲兵在後面野鷄崗上林中架設重砲。等太陽軍追兵至時。即開砲襲擊。又令一營步兵散處在沿鐵路附近的山林裏。等候野鷄崗上砲響等。即伏在山林中發槍。不要出擊。作爲疑兵。自已却領一營騎兵。從間道抄過去。專待敵人敗却時攔殺。各軍分派已定。太陽軍騎兵先至。他們是分三路殺來的。左翼騎兵。右翼步軍。中路是沿鐵路。以鐵甲車爲衝鋒利器的。背後有野砲隊掩護。忠淑見敝人騎兵已到。即令開槍射擊。但是敵人騎兵十分精銳。如風捲殘雲的逼上。這裏遂用機關槍掃射。只聽敵人方面轟的一聲。一個大砲彈落在忠淑附近。炸死了幾個健兒。忠淑毫不懼怯。仍是指揮軍隊應戰。大砲響後。鐵甲車已衝鋒而來。右翼步兵亦已從側面夾攻。槍聲緊接。如燃暴竹。</p>

<p>▲市塲概况　厘價以前日過低、故昨日銀行略有扯高之舉結果竟昂二厘光景、但銷胃方面無甚進展銀拆以年關迫近、歸束在即、頭襯多缺咸須傾軋、職是多缺雙方難免有爭持行爲、是以抬高輔幣、爲年終之例有激變、連日青雲直上、三日中已漲半分有强、誠恐不久廣角須超出六分外、而銅元則縮進七十千大關也、</p>
<p>▲厘拆價格（洋厘）早市厘價、以銀行扯高、人心頗好、收盤時較前日加漲一厘、計爲七錢二分二厘七毫半、午市賡續加昂八七五、爲七錢二分三厘六毫二忽半、兩市共漲二厘弱、形勢大爲升騰、（銀拆）早午兩市均爲三錢八分、劃頭加水二錢、銀行掛牌一錢五分、緣近日拆票交易怠懈、銀拆軒輊少人注意是以一遇警訊、立刻可以抬高也、至於能否回鬆、須視市面大局之安否以爲斷耳、</p>
<p>▲輔幣市情　江南小洋隨廣角之漲而俱高早市爲六錢四分八厘、午市突至六錢五分、較前日早市頓高三釐、交易早市六千角、午市九千角廣東小洋、早市爲六錢五分八厘、午市爲六錢五分八厘半、結果較前日早市驟張四厘有半、交易早市十八萬五千角、午市七萬角銅元改縮二千文、爲三百七十一千、三數日中亦遞縮五六千文、</p>
<p>▲銀洋進出（銀欵）昨值星期一、又爲年關伊邇、故收解中對於結欵進出甚夥、華商收解票欵三百三四十萬、外商收解票欵二百七八十萬、各種貨匯稅什諸欵收解七百三四十萬、特欵收解二百餘萬、結欵收解五百餘萬、進倉一百四十萬、錢莊銀公單收解三千九百餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百十餘萬、各路匯欵收解七十餘萬、解現一百餘萬、（洋欵）匯劃票欵、早市做出一百七十七萬、午市做出九十五萬五千、鈔票早市十二萬五千、午市六萬五千、場外鈔票早市十九萬、午市十萬○八千、銀行交易、早市互市七十萬、午市互市四十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解百六十餘萬、鈔票進出一百三四十萬、錢莊洋公單收解四百九十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百三十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百七十餘萬、小錢莊交易四五十萬、客路來去胃仍寂、</p>
<h3>證劵限價撤銷後之債市</h3>
<p>上午人氣虚弱下降殊勁</p>
<p>後市情形稍佳趨勢轉穩</p>
<p>昨（念日）華商證券交易所各債市况現貨雖有多種開出、但成交無多期貨以限價已撤銷、成交較旺、市塲買賣人氣活潑、至言各債券市價之趨勢則爲對日局勢緊張、錦州方面戰爭恐終難倖免故前途愈形嚴重、再前定之最低限價、交易所方面、以諸都不便、商由財部同意、於昨日起撤銷、雖金融業及各方人户均鎭定如前無多額售出、惟以人心虚弱、一般零户、急求脫售、而需要仍非常清淡、前市初開下降甚勁、鹽稅十二月期在開出時即跌至限價停拍、統稅十二月期在次盤亦跌至限價而停拍惟於次盤時、其趨勢即漸轉平和、後市一盤人心略定、有多種債券價比上午盤旋略堅、特結果較上週末仍下降達二三元左右、僅九六整六祗小半元左右、觀債券市之形勢、續極混沌、如時局稍有轉機者、不難即可回漲也計現貨交易共二萬三千元、期貨前市共四百零八萬、後市二百五十六萬元、合計六百六十四萬元</p>

<h3>紗花紗市穩健</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、以國事多難、暴日騷擾愈甚、致金融緊急、人心不振、散户多頭傾向抛出、但市上現貨底貨不厚、多頭把持近月不放、所以遂呈進退兩難之勢云、</p>
<p>▲遠月標好五六錢人標前市開盤、以美棉平平、塲中買户未旺、各月漲一·二·三·五錢午後平平、各月漲一·二·四錢、全日成交統計一萬一千一百五十包、查賣出明德六百五十包、愼記五百包、益昶二千一百包、買進義餘千一百包、賡豐六百包、恒益一千九百包、公泰五百五十包、兹將收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>棉市在堅定中</h3>
<p>棉市微堅、因金價稍漲、印棉趨漲、致人心平定、多頭拉力尤强、然美棉平澹、而各廠實需杜絶且銀根奇緊、現花銷路愈清惟一般業外者及漢甯帮多頭、因其底盤太枯、所以做多心思較濃云、</p>
<p>▲漢標稍漲一二錢　漢標前市開盤以印棉漲、各月均漲一·二錢、午後市氣平平各月跌五分、全日成交統計五萬零五百担、查賣出益昶三千担、梅記一千担、裕大二千一百担、長和一千担、買進信誠三千五百担餘昶三千八百担、益豐一千二百担、恒益二千九百担、恒大一千擔公泰三千四百担、兹將收盤列左、漢標收盤價漲跌存賬數</p>

<p>▲廠需無復活氣象　現棉交易異常岑寂各廠外棉吸飽後、都無餘胃云、</p>
<h3>印英棉業週訊</h3>
<p>▲孟買　上週因到貨缺乏市况甚堅日金雖跌但因棉收損害嚴重、仍不敢在此高價中抛售奥姆辣之堅昂、全因供不應求所致日本廠商大購美棉、以代高價之印棉、中國則將前進之額獲利了結、現貨方面、新棉需要、繼續活動、本地廠商僅購若干以應急需、附録上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<p>▲利物浦　上週現銷暢達、期貨因日本廢除金本位及蘭開夏恐有工潮市况上落不定惟因外國疋頭有加稅希望、略起鼓動各種貨物均以金價而跌、惟原棉因美國南方有囤積運動仍能維持、埃及棉市况暗淡無特色、</p>
<h3>糧食河下米市逐步下游</h3>
<p>▲南頭　昨日各帮來源約三十號左右、本街去化不振、常錫西新與蘇同帮逐步下游、高軟二角次降三角早晚　跌風轉靜、開盤各低三四角、洋杜尖貨色寥寥、無升降、變陰二元銷路尚佳、趨勢難鬆客尖市銷平淡、皖甯來源凋零、貨積有限、行情平穩、</p>
<p>▲新閘　昨日依然未能轉機、早間臨市者寥寥無幾但胃口更呆、開盤逐步下瀉、　路到頭不斷、惟國歷年關、行號雙方結束賬欵而河積尚厚、　根奇緊、客方殺價、西新早薄稻各低二三角、洋杜尖走銷不爽形勢續跌、惟通變酒坊胃口極好、形勢喊起近角、</p>
<h3>現小絞價漲角外</h3>
<p>▲漢口帮續辦三千餘包</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况轉好、因現貨消化轉活、漢口帮辦興暢轉獨帮辦去三千餘包、本街亦成交二千多包、價乃突漲角外、本街購辦小　外、又進新到之台州米五百包市形亦爲跟好、計開出小校九元三角半至九元、台州米十一元二角半、期米有回籠貨五月份小校二百噸價四兩七錢三分至四兩七錢、新交易有順全降售出二月份小絞一千噸、價四兩二錢、又如禪臣等洋行亦有同價電報到下但尚未成交云、</p>
<h3>粉市轉俏</h3>
<p>昨日粉市呈初平繼俏之象上午幾盤因洋麥報價徵小二角人心自疲、旋以廠家觀望、一部份内地帮稍有進意、抵空者亦頗　躍、市氣遂見好面、迨至下午開盤、近期因傳華豐抵空甚暢遠期則南帮陸續吸收故　氣均立轉俏俐各月份均回漲二分左右、觀察後步、或須仍轉好勢也、結果本月份較前日漲二分、一二月份好二分二厘半、三四月份漲一分七厘半五月份大二分</p>
<h3>麥市平靜</h3>
<p>▲午後隨粉價稍稍帶昂</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、因洋麥報價徵小、人心平疲、近遠期交易亦多　寞因收束在即、内地帮均少出入、故市氣平靜異常迨至下午開盤、交易仍少、惟以粉市轉俏、近遠期開價亦稍稍帶昂、不過在洋麥之問訊不絶中、買户仍不免戒懼也結果本月份較前週好一分二月份不動、一四月份好四分、五六月份無開云、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白步升一錢</h3>
<p>▲冰花青開盤頗俏</p>
<p>昨糖市産區電訊、仍乏到來公會市塲劃盤買氣殊盛、市價因以步升、荷糖二十四號粗砂白成交千餘袋、價元九兩七錢、進出兩懈、綿荷白升十一兩三錢半、出户且缺、八號荷赤八兩三錢半、九號貨八兩五錢半、市形亦均俏秀、太古糖現貨開出二千餘包、即裝、Ｂ嘜七兩六錢、亦有售出、因是劃盤交易、轉覺寥落、B嘜十一兩七錢半、HX嘜十一兩五錢半、HM嘜十一兩四錢半、受手沉寂趨勢尚堅、號盤有華新號　開現貨荷赤五百五十袋、價元八兩五錢半、國貨黄崗青開出數百包、價元八兩三錢、高八兩四錢、冰花頭號貨開價九兩八錢、市形均屬種秀云</p>
<h3>閘北貨木耳市面略見轉機</h3>
<p>木耳邇來以銷路呆滯、一再見跌、照近幾年來之市面而論、已屬低價、因較高之什耳、售盤曾降至七十兩關内、以最高價比之幾跌去三分之一、降度之甚、可見一斑、現閩粤等帮去　稍活、然仍未暢旺、故售盤雖見微升、終難過好、昨市　上副耳售百三十兩、高什耳七十三四兩、普通莊七十兩、低次者價悄一、市象平平、</p>
<h3>絲茶海外絲電不轉</h3>
<p>▲期現絲經均無成交</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市益形呆滯、緣海外絲市續呈不振、上週中發往之絲電昨晨均無　滬、各歐莊咸思廉價抛購華絲商態度消極、昨市期現各絲經均無成交云、</p>
<h3>米蘭義絲歐銷仍滯</h3>
<p>米蘭義絲市面依然疲靜、上週中歐美各出口商、對於期現各絲、類多觀望不前、價仍趨跌、雙特號每基　祖開三百十五利拉、特號二百七十四利拉上等二百十一利拉云、</p>
<h3>茶市益趨沉靜</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市沉靜、　現下屯溪歙縣等路合銷之緑茶、均已銷售無　、婺源高莊緑茶、法　來電仍未發動、是以旅滬英　行家、多持觀望態度、昨市　祗成交土莊平水珠茶共計七十四箱、售價均跌二三兩云、</p>
<h3>疋頭鞋毡呢市呈挺秀</h3>
<p>鞋毡呢市目今尚稱穩固、售價亦見挺秀、申地鞋子作場、齊有進胃、首都無錫　内地帮、亦相繼郵電囑　、以致走銷較上月爲暢、最盛行者、推夾色及　灰桃紅藍等顔色、昔所風行俏活之金黄蘋果湖緑等色已成過去、賣方願貶價减賤一兩一碼、亦少受主、昨　　　克百賚咪吔泰和一千號、均喊售七兩八錢半、九百五十號爲七兩六錢、七百號七兩二錢半、八百五十號七兩、八百號爲六兩五六錢、</p>
<h3>五金新鐵絲跌價五錢</h3>
<p>連日五金交易因實銷不起市面十分寂寞、惟貨價節、在此歲聿云暮之期、反多下游、昨如十六號至二十號新鐵絲、每擔祗售十三兩五錢、二十一號至二十五號十四兩五錢、均各較前跌小五錢、但買客方面、仍不敢貿然多進、所以開出之數依然無多、綜觀各方形勢、逆料標準方面、仍有續小之慮云、</p>
<h3>美白鐵内盤頽鬆</h3>
<p>美白鐵自英貨　　裝到後、市象一蹶不振雖經各同業竭力維持、但終以不良之環境壓迫、致標準層仍有暗步　鬆之勢、刻薄貨祗售十七兩、比前跌二錢半、厚花色亦均各小去一二錢不一云</p>
<h3>煤炭　柳江煤新貨裝到</h3>
<p>柳江白煤、已有一月無貨裝來、此間存煤、早已售完、即臭柳江亦成巧貨、售賣一空、故本埠各同行店家、望貨頗般、盤價亦復趨漲勢、兹悉昨日煤業棧有新貨裝到、計香柳江二千噸、臭柳江三子噸矣、而一般同行聞訊放船往裝者、已絡繹於黄浦江面售價香柳江每噸十六兩七錢半、臭柳十二兩五錢云</p>

<p>▲肇事原因　虹橋機塲時有外國人士買賣機件、即到該處試飛、故飛行方法、鈎心鬭角、誇耀技術、而航空處練習人員、、爲不願示弱於人起見、亦爭奇鬭異、顚倒升降、應有盡有、而飛行愈低、動作愈顯、亦愈易肇事、所以曾經兩度發生禍變者也、</p>
<p>▲昨晨情形　該處練習人員、旣爲國防而練習飛行、則戰鬭時因須以機關槍在空中掃射、故須將機面向下翻轉飛行、以便發槍、陳啓華及李利峯兩君、旣乘雙發動之摩斯式江鵾號飛機、翱翔空際、約二百尺高、乃練習倒轉、飛行時偶一不愼、該機即發生螺旋直降、一落而不可復遏、一轉瞬間、已顚簸墜地矣、江鵾機即時破壞、已不堪再用、其他各學員、見已肇禍、趕即趨前救護、</p>
<p>▲死傷慘狀　陳啓華當機墜時、腦壳即被跌翻出、手足均皆折斷、當急車送骨科醫院、但該院不願接受、乃改送寳隆醫院、亦未接受、旋即氣絶身死、遂送萬國殯儀館、而李利峯則跌傷頭腦肛門腿足等部、出血頗多、兼見吐血症、勢亦瀕於危殆、經注射强心針及接血針、但仍在危險中、據醫生云、須明早（即今晨）方可診斷其能否脫險之時間、但至今晨十二時零二十分、救治無效、在院逝世、</p>
<p>▲死者年齡　陳啓華年二十四歲、福州人、李利峯二十歲、福州人、均曾在中央航空學校畢業來滬、在海軍航空處練習陸上飛行、李君尤膽略過人、勇敢擅飛、動作敏捷、不幸竟以身殉、尤爲國難聲中之大不幸事件云、</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army in Liaoning Province Begins a General Offensive</h3>
<p>The Japanese Government Authorizes Shigeru Honjo to Act at His Discretion in the Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>Starting Yesterday Morning, the Siege of Changtu, Faku Gate, and the Xinmin Area Began</p>
<p>Honjo Establishes a Headquarters in Kaiyuan, Intending to Seize Jinzhou</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army, Under the Pretext of Suppressing Bandits, Makes a Major Advance on Jinzhou</h3>
<p>Honjo Has Military Dictatorial Powers</p>
<p>Troops Are Rapidly Transferred and Concentrated in Kaiyuan</p>
<p>The Second General Offensive Order Has Been Issued</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese government has decided to grant the Japanese Commander Honjo absolute freedom of action in the Three Eastern Provinces, granting him military dictatorial power. Consequently, he is recklessly carrying out what he calls a bandit suppression operation on a large scale, with the real purpose of seizing Jin County. Starting at dawn this morning, the Japanese army began to jointly attack the so-called bandits scattered in various places, advancing along a broad front while consolidating their positions. They have established the headquarters of the Manchurian Independent Defense Army in Kaiyuan. According to its self-published official report, successive victories have been won in bandit suppression in Changtu, Faku Gate, and other places. As Honjo resumes large-scale military operations in the Three Eastern Provinces, Tokyo's official telegram adds fuel to the fire, intensifying his ferocity. It notifies the Seiyukai cabinet that it has decided to leave all military actions in the Three Eastern Provinces to Honjo's discretion. Therefore, Honjo no longer needs to seek instructions from Tokyo regarding troop deployments. As a result, today he has specially ordered armored trains, infantry, artillery, and aircraft to advance together, engaging in what he claims is bandit suppression. Japanese troops from Siping Street, Lian Shan Pass, Dashiqiao, and other places are now concentrated in Kaiyuan, and important staff members are also gathering in Kaiyuan to discuss the Japanese army's actions on Tuesday. The first batch of Japanese reinforcements has arrived in Shenyang today and will be dispatched immediately. Their destination remains a secret. It is expected that a second and third batch will arrive successively in the coming days. The Kwantung Army Headquarters has also issued numerous public announcements, all claiming how rampant the banditry is and how the Japanese army is advancing, as a cover for their attempt to seize Jin County. They even claim that the Japanese army has obtained China's plan to recover Shenyang. (21st National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Former Minister of the Army, Mr. Nan, is currently on his way to Shenyang. According to an official report from the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters in Shenyang, the Japanese army in South Manchuria has begun to attack Chinese bandits and unofficial troops. Based on observations from all sides, this action by the Japanese army will inevitably lead to a major battle between the official Chinese and Japanese armies to determine who controls Jinzhou. The commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Honjo, issued an attack order at 9:00 PM last night, ordering his troops to begin attacking simultaneously at dawn today on the South Manchuria Railway line, the Siping-Taonan Railway line, and between Dagushan and Tongliao, as well as in Kaiyuan, Tieling, and other places. At dawn today, the Japanese air force stationed in Shenyang also departed to drop bombs on Tianjiatun, Faku Gate, and other places. Furthermore, the Japanese army believes that a clash between the official Chinese and Japanese armies is an unavoidable fact because the Chinese army's attitude is firm and unwilling to automatically retreat into the Shanhaiguan Pass. Moreover, the Japanese troops in Changchun, Nanling, and other places have all been transferred elsewhere and departed by train yesterday, but their destination is unknown. This shows the thoroughness of the Japanese army's planning. Former Minister of the Army, Mr. Nan, plans to stay in Manchuria for two weeks. Before leaving Japan, he declared that the Japanese occupation of Manchuria occurred during his tenure as Minister of the Army, so he personally should bear full responsibility and must go to inspect it in person. (21st National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The second general offensive order to attack bandits has been issued, and the atmosphere of war in the Shenyang area has suddenly become intense. At 9:00 AM on the 21st, a section of the Shenyang motorcycle corps [number illegible] drove urgently to Kaiyuan to participate in the general offensive. The headquarters of the Japanese garrison in Siping Street moved to Kaiyuan on the morning of the 21st and decided to stay there for several days. The Japanese military authorities claim that the area of this general offensive is limited to the area west of the South Manchuria Railway line and north of Shenyang. If anyone interferes with the Japanese army's actions or assists bandits, a serious situation will inevitably occur. (21st Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to investigations by transportation circles, from the 10th to the 18th of this month, a total of 291 Japanese officers, soldiers, and plainclothes personnel, as well as a large number of military supplies, were transported from Tianjin to Shanhaiguan. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japan has decided to invade Jinzhou, and our country will only take legitimate self-defense measures. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese military authorities issued the second general offensive order at 4:00 AM this morning. Japanese troops in Changtu, Kaiyuan, Tieling, and other places simultaneously began military operations, attacking the bandits in the area west of the South Manchuria Railway line north of Shenyang. Additional reinforcements are continuously being sent to the battlefield from here. (21st Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese Ministry of the Army has telegraphed the Kwantung Agency, completely entrusting Commander Shigeru Honjo to freely handle all future military actions of the Kwantung Army and to respond to all parties with appropriate and effective means, without waiting for instructions from the central government. After receiving the order, Honjo moved his headquarters to Kaiyuan Station last night, summoned Chief of Staff Kiuchi and Adjutant Saito, and held an all-night meeting, warning the Jinzhou government to retreat into the Shanhaiguan Pass immediately. At the same time, he urgently transferred a certain regiment from Siping Street and troops from Lian Shan Bay and Dashiqiao to concentrate at Kaiyuan Station and began attacking in the direction of Changtu and Kaiyuan. Meanwhile, Commander Mori led a large army to launch a general offensive in the direction of Faku Gate and Tongjiangkou. (21st Electric Communication Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Shenyang, the Japanese army has begun to besiege bandits in the areas of Changtu, Faku Gate, and Xinmin, starting at 4:00 AM today. These three places form an arc, starting from Xinmin, 35 miles west of Shenyang, and ending at Faku Gate, 80 miles north of Shenyang. It is reported that this Japanese army offensive will be limited to the area west of the South Manchuria Railway line and north of Shenyang, but only if the Chinese army does not assist the bandits or interfere with the Japanese army's actions. It is estimated that there are three thousand bandits. Although the weather is 20 degrees below zero on the thermometer, the morale of the Japanese army participating in this operation is said to be quite good. At the same time, Japanese troops from Siping Street, Changtu, Kaiyuan, Tieling, and Shenyang set off together. The commander is Mori, the commander of the Independent Defense Army. His headquarters has been moved to Kaiyuan, and Second Division Commander Tamon will also go to Kaiyuan soon. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>British Military Attaché Visits Honjo</h3>
<p>Asks Two Questions About the Military Situation in Jinzhou</p>
<p>Hopes the Japanese Army Will Not Escalate the Situation</p>
<p>(Beiping) The British military attaché arrived in Shenyang yesterday from Jinzhou to meet with Honjo and asked two questions: (1) Has the Japanese army issued an ultimatum to the Chinese authorities demanding the withdrawal of the Jinzhou garrison? (2) Does the Japanese army have a plan to attack Jinzhou? Honjo replied that the Japanese army would issue an ultimatum to China within a few days. The frequent movements of Chinese troops recently will be unfavorable to the Japanese army, so they are taking preventive measures. The British military attaché hopes that the Japanese army will not escalate the situation. Honjo did not respond. The British military attaché has telegraphed the British embassy with the situation. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Has Not Yet Received the Final Japanese Ultimatum</h3>

<h3>British Newspaper Criticizes Japan's Aggressive Policy</h3>
<p>London - The Daily Express's editorial this morning stated that the Japanese army in Manchuria has issued an ultimatum to Zhang Xueliang, demanding that Chinese troops in Jinzhou withdraw into the Shanhaiguan Pass, saying that Japan's policy is to eliminate China's remaining jurisdiction in Manchuria, as it did in Korea thirty-five years ago. Today's so-called independence of Manchuria is just like the independence of Korea, merely a prelude to annexation. This is what the Japanese call an aggressive policy, with war and the army as its tools. The League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact are not what they care about. This is certainly an unpleasant fact, but it is also a fact that Geneva must deal with. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Member of the League of Nations Investigation Team Is Appointed</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The ambassador to the United States, Yoshida, has received instructions from the government to return home to serve as the Japanese member of the Manchurian investigation team sent by the League of Nations Administrative Council.

Yoshida previously served as a counselor at the Japanese embassy in the United Kingdom. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Tianjin Break Into the Chinese Concession and Provoke</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) For three consecutive days, the 18th, 19th, and 20th, Japanese armed soldiers have been demonstrating and provoking on various roads in our Nanshi district. Citizens have given way to avoid incidents, but the Japanese soldiers have become even more rampant. At 8:00 AM on the 21st, over twenty Japanese military police and soldiers, fully armed, broke into the Chinese concession in two groups. One group entered our Jianwei Avenue and Nanguan Avenue from the west entrance of Furong Street, went to Yangjia Garden, and turned back to the Japanese concession. The other group entered our territory in the Third District and First Police Station from Rong Street, as well as the area outside the South Gate, and turned back to the Japanese concession. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Another report states that when Japanese soldiers demonstrated in the Chinese streets on the morning of the 21st, they broke into the Nankai Girls' Middle School, conducted a thorough search, and searched the dormitories, study rooms, and even the toilets. This is extremely unreasonable. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Since the 21st, the Japanese concession has been inspecting pedestrians and has increased the severity of the inspections. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 11:30 AM on the 21st, twenty-five Japanese armed soldiers took a bus to Tanggu and Dagang. Although the Japanese soldiers have vacated the houses in the Sixth Police Station of the Second District, they have not withdrawn the fortifications they built within the jurisdiction of that police station. Our side cannot exercise police power, so we cannot take over that police station. When a reporter inspected Nanshi on the 21st, the shops were still closed and there were few pedestrians on the roads. The Huilian prostitute house within the First Police Station of our First District has been occupied by Japanese soldiers since the night of the 8th of last month and has not been vacated. The reporter saw dozens of holes drilled in the wall facing the street, with machine guns placed in the holes and over a dozen Japanese soldiers moving back and forth inside. According to nearby residents, if Chinese people occasionally pass by during the day, the Japanese soldiers throw stones at them from the wall holes, causing laughter. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Brutal Japanese Launch an Attack on Jinzhou</h3>
<p>Since the League of Nations' third hasty adjournment, another ten days have passed in the blink of an eye. The selection of the investigation team has not yet been determined, while the brutal Japanese army attacking Jinzhou has been formally launched. The solemn resolutions of the League of Nations' first, second, and third meetings have been torn to shreds by the Japanese. How will the League of Nations deal with this? We have no time to plan for them and need not question them. The only thing we must decide is what measures our country will take in this situation. This is the most serious and pressing issue at hand. All people look up and eagerly hope that the government can provide a concrete and specific answer. The League of Nations' third hasty adjournment only established a resolution that was neither painful nor itchy for the Northeast issue. This proves that they are either incompetent or have tacitly approved of the Japanese's brutality and will never uphold justice because of our appeals and requests. If we were to impose real sanctions on the brutal Japanese, as British reporter Mr. Rice Moore revealed, then the outbreak of the Northeast Incident would be a great international conspiracy. The League of Nations' procrastination is their predetermined plan. Mr. Rice Moore specified that this conspiracy is divided into five stages. First, they expect that our country has no ability to defend itself and will inevitably beg the League of Nations for help. Second, Briand pretends to express sympathy for our country and deliberately passes a resolution in the League of Nations warning Japan to withdraw its troops. However, Japan insists on its fundamental five points and refuses to withdraw its troops. The League of Nations then adopts various delaying tactics to allow Japan to consolidate its position and military preparations. If what Mr. Rice Moore said is true, then the secret and fraudulent black curtain of international affairs has now been clearly revealed. Our country is unaware that it is being plotted against by foreign conspiratorial diplomats and politicians, and the Northeast disaster was created by these people. In the future, will there still be room to appeal to the international community for help?</p>
<p>Since changes have occurred in our country's domestic political situation, many Chinese people have shifted their foreign policy goals inward and even believe that the Northeast issue has come to an end and that the lost half of the country has become a fait accompli that will never be recovered. This view is a big mistake and will harm the country. Today's situation is actually many times more serious than in the past. The Japanese cabinet has changed, and the Seiyukai has returned to power. The Inukai cabinet has announced its policy towards Manchuria, resolutely implementing the Tanaka policy. A certain Japanese newspaper's speculation about Yoshizawa's diplomacy also stated that Yoshizawa must take the advantages of both Chinese and Japanese diplomacy and avoid their disadvantages, being both firm and flexible. He will combine Tanaka's aggressiveness and Shidehara's passivity. Not only will he deal with the Manchuria issue thoroughly, but he will also take decisive measures on all issues with China. Therefore, the Inukai cabinet's diplomacy towards China will become increasingly tougher and increasingly escalate, revealing its imperialist face. There is no doubt about this. French newspapers have praised Yoshizawa's appointment as foreign minister, saying that Yoshizawa is a diplomat with the most stable views. He displayed great gentleness in handling the Manchuria dispute in the League of Nations Administrative Council, making negotiations extremely difficult. The attitude of the international community can also be inferred from this. It can be seen that today's situation has become even more grave and difficult. Those who say that the Northeast issue has come to an end are not only unwise but also complacent. Alas, under the action of implementing the Tanaka policy towards China, even if our country does not try to recover the lost territories, even if we try our best to endure and make concessions to gain temporary peace, how can we obtain it?</p>
<p>Now, the brutal army has formally launched an attack on Jinzhou. They are also preparing to establish a governor-general in Liaoning and Jilin, viewing our Northeast as a continuation of Korea. Today's events are not for our country to declare war on Japan, but for self-defense. What the people of the whole country demand from the government is not to declare war on Japan, but to defend ourselves. From a factual and theoretical perspective, in today's serious situation, we must not remain calm, beg the international community for pity, or not resist and not take legitimate self-defense measures. The enthusiastic public sentiment and the calls for action over the past month are all for this. How will our government act today? Will it continue to not resist, or will it rise up to defend ourselves? All people look up and cannot help but feel suspicion, panic, and anxiety.</p>
<p>Japanese national Takashiro Fushimi's observation of the Northeast Incident said that no matter what losses China suffers in Manchuria because of the Northeast Incident, it is indeed a stimulus, an opportunity, and a warning for the entire China. Perhaps China will be able to avoid internal dangers because of this. Indeed, the outbreak of the Northeast Incident allowed our country's internal dispute between Nanjing and Guangdong to be resolved, and a situation of peaceful unification was achieved with difficulty after several twists and turns. However, to this day, both Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin still claim to be ill and will not enter Beijing. The so-called issue of the ten committees has become an obstacle to the progress of the Central Plenary Session. The Central Executive Committee members who have arrived in Beijing will be busy with the distribution of positions and the placement of personnel, and will not have time to pay attention to the great plan of national salvation. Foreign aggression is imminent, but internal disputes continue. We cannot help but think that the authorities have not been able to accept the warning of the Northeast disaster, have not been able to accept the stimulus of the Northeast disaster, and have not been able to seize the opportunity to strengthen internal unity by external aggression. Looking around the mountains and rivers, everything is bleak. In the vast future, where will our nation find peace?</p>

<h3>The Issue of Establishing Political Branches</h3>
<p>Both Nanjing and Guangdong Committees Attach Great Importance To It</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing and Guangdong sides have different views on the cases of political branches in North China and South China, and both attach great importance to them. From the opinions of various committee members, the differences in principle are not significant. However, when talking to the press, they said that whether or not it will be passed depends on the plenary session. In fact, there has already been an agreement. Jiang Zemin raised the issue for discussion at the Central Standing Committee before the 15th, and it was decided to submit it to the plenary session. The trend is that it will definitely be implemented. The organization and powers of the branches will still need to be discussed at length. (21st Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The transfer of the Northeast Political Committee to exercise its powers has been well received by some Central Executive Committee members in Beijing, who believe that it is necessary to cope with the current tense situation in North China because the Sino-Japanese dispute has not ended. After the party and political system is reformed, the proposed re-establishment of political branches will be realized. The name of the political branch may not change, and its organization and power will be the same as before. Zhang Xueliang has requested the expansion of the Northeast Political Committee and has recommended candidates to be appointed, intending to use the power of Li Shizeng and Zhang Ji in the party to quickly organize the North China Political Branch. Jiang Zemin has recommended Zhang Xueliang as chairman, but the Guangdong committee members have not agreed. The Southwest region has also recently requested a political branch in Guangdong, citing the emergency of border defense as an example. (After the Kuomintang unified the country in 1928, it established political branches in Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Beiping to handle all political, military, and financial affairs except party affairs and diplomacy nearby. In the spring of 1929, Li Zongren used the name of the Wuhan branch to investigate and dismiss Lu Diping, the chairman of Hunan Province, and the central government abolished it.) The establishment of political branches is not inconsistent with the centralism and local decentralization teachings in the Premier's Outline of National Reconstruction. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Remarks from Various Central Executive Committee Members</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Jiayou said that this plenary session is the best opportunity for the party to unite sincerely. The country is in great difficulty, and it is impossible for the whole party to earnestly abide by the Premier's teachings, the national people to rise up together, and go to the national crisis. I have proposed nine proposals with comrades such as Li Liejun and Cheng Qian in Shanghai, and I will submit them to the conference to protect the rights of the people and enrich the mass movement. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tan Zhen said that the biggest problem with party affairs in recent years is that politics controls party affairs. Therefore, the spirit of the party has been completely lost, and the people's belief in the party is becoming increasingly weak, even hateful. If it is not reorganized, it will go bankrupt. In the past, the party was unconsciously centered on one person, which was fundamentally wrong. In the future, it must avoid being centered on one person and establish a central organization of the party. Last year, an expanded meeting was held in Beijing to reorganize the party, but it did not produce any results. This year, Japan has invaded the country, and the war has stopped. External difficulties will invigorate the country, and members of the party should not all want to be Central Executive Committee members, but should focus on the middle-level party departments, to guide the people of a province or city into the revolutionary path. I plan to propose focusing on the work of middle-level central cadres, not to have the military interfere with politics or politics interfere with the party, and to make the party an appendage of politics.

<h3>Yan Huiqing Arrives in Washington</h3>
<p>Speaks to the American Press</p>
<p>(Washington) The newly appointed Chinese Minister to the United States, Dr. Yan Huiqing, arrived in Washington today. He is expected to present his credentials early this week. It is anticipated that he will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Stimson before Christmas. Yan Huiqing, in his first statement to the Washington press today, asserted that the Three Eastern Provinces have become the Alsace-Lorraine of the Far East (ceded to Germany by France after the Franco-Prussian War and returned to France after the European War). The Chinese people cannot rest until their current dispute with Japan is completely and permanently resolved. The Three Eastern Provinces are China's granary and backyard, and China had hoped to use them as a place to resettle its surplus population. Now that Japan has occupied such a vast area, all trade opportunities for other countries in Manchuria have come to an end. The actions of the Japanese in the past three months have completely closed the Open Door in the Three Eastern Provinces. He also stated that the Japanese invasion of Chinese territory has dealt a fatal blow to the future of the World Disarmament Conference. How can the nations of the world reduce their armaments when one country can seize the territory of its peaceful neighbor by force? (National News Agency telegram, 20th)</p>

<h3>Both Nanjing and Guangdong Sides Want to Add Nine Central Committee Members</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, the Guangdong Committee has two small group meetings, and the Nanjing Committee is also holding small group meetings in a certain residence, seemingly for the issue of adding nine members to each side. Also, the Guangdong Committee proposes that if the nine Shanghai-based members are added, and the Beijing-based candidates are also added by nine, then Guangdong also intends to add nine more. According to this calculation, in addition to the 160 people, 27 more members must be added. The Beijing side seems to think this is too many.

<h3>Gu Weijun Issues Foreign Policy Statement</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the incident in the Eastern Provinces occurred, Japan has disregarded the resolutions of the League of Nations and continued its violent acts. Recently, it has attacked Jinzhou in an attempt to fulfill its aggressive ambitions. Foreign Minister Gu Weijun issued a statement on the 20th, detailing the important political and economic position of the Eastern Provinces as the greatest key to peace in East Asia, and telegraphed it to European and American newspapers, in order to urge the attention of the governments and peoples of all countries. (Central News Agency telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Wu Chaoshu Issues Statement in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Chaoshu's statement: (1) Political Branch: In my opinion, it is impossible for the central government to govern all political affairs in the more than 20 provinces of our country, as it is beyond its reach. The so-called emperors of the past only nominally ruled the provinces, and each province was handled by the governors-general. The past achievements of the Republic of China in the past twenty years are already very evident. In response to the needs of the times, it would be acceptable to establish branches in areas where there are special political circumstances in the future. However, I hope that the branches can earnestly shoulder the heavy responsibilities of one side for the central government, and there is no need to limit the establishment to only the north and south. (2) National Defense Agency: The military forces of the whole country need a strong and powerful central authority to command them. Although there is now a proposal to form a military national defense committee, because the survival of the country depends on national defense, which has become an important condition, it may be necessary to establish branches in the northeast and southwest, depending on the needs of national defense and military affairs. (3) League of Nations: Paris decided to severely restrict the military actions of both sides. Before the ink was dry, Japan attacked Jinzhou again. The Japanese have always been untrustworthy, as has long been shown to the world. Its view of the value of the League of Nations resolutions can be predicted. As I have said before, the power of the so-called League of Nations should not be taken too seriously, nor should it be underestimated. It all depends on how we use it to influence it. It is already an open fact that today's League of Nations can still restrain weak countries, but not strong countries. (4) The formation of the Inukai Tsuyoshi cabinet in Japan has a great impact on the future of Sino-Japanese relations. We are unable to answer frankly. Although Inukai Tsuyoshi is an old friend of the Premier and has always expressed sympathy for our party, he is the president of the Seiyukai, and his position is completely different. The diplomatic policy of the Seiyukai is not very clever. Looking at its recent attitude towards China, it has launched a large-scale invasion of Jinzhou, which is even more brutal than the cabinets of the Tanaka Giichi era. We are very heartbroken. As for Sino-Japanese sentiments, we should abandon our subjective standpoint and observe them from an objective perspective in the future. In short, resolving all Sino-Japanese disputes is definitely not a matter of a day or two. (5) Special Diplomatic Committee: It was established because Wang Zhengting resigned at the time, and diplomacy was urgent. After the unified government is established, and foreign affairs are entrusted to someone, it seems that there is no need for the committee to continue to exist. During the current transitional period, Foreign Minister Gu is still in charge. I have not participated in diplomatic deliberations since coming to Nanjing. (6) Regarding the mass movement, whether to restore the vertical organization of the 17th year [1928]. In principle, I believe that it should be so, but I have been away from the country for several years, and there are many gaps in my knowledge of the domestic situation. Everything should be carefully considered. (7) My impression after coming to Nanjing is that the city of Nanjing is really more advanced than it was four years ago, but the water in Nanjing is still as turbid as ever. Our country's construction is difficult to advance as rapidly as other countries, but I only hope that it does not go backwards. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Unable to Go to Nanjing Due to Illness</h3>
<p>Doctor Says He Still Needs Three Months of Rest</p>
<p>Shao and Zeng Visit in Shanghai to Express Concern</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Chaoshu told someone that Wang Jingwei's illness, in addition to diabetes, is that a giant worm has grown in his liver. According to the German doctor, who has been practicing medicine in China for six years, Wang is the second person he has discovered with this disease. He said that at least three months of rest and treatment are required to recover. Wang is currently convalescing in the Shanghai German Hospital, and is subject to strict restrictions by the doctor, lying in bed all day long. If he were to travel again, it would be too dangerous. Wang's trip to Nanjing is in fact no longer possible. It is also heard that Wang's illness was caused by drinking mineral spring water. Unexpectedly, the water contained an Echinococcus egg (the name of a worm), which entered the liver, causing liver swelling and digestive stagnation, and sending all the sugar in the body directly into the blood, and then into the urethra. The condition recurred from time to time several years ago, but it was still mild. This time, the illness is serious. According to the doctor's diagnosis, if he does not rest for three months, it will become a difficult disease to treat. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>France and Russia Sign Non-Aggression Treaty</h3>
<p>French Press Believes Third Article is Dangerous</p>
<p>▲Havas News Agency, Paris, 21st – The Franco-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty was provisionally signed on August 24th by the Secretary-General of the French Foreign Ministry and the Soviet Russian Ambassador to France. The Paris Echo has recently analyzed the treaty, which consists of six articles, excluding the preamble, and an annex. The preamble mentions the Briand-Kellogg Pact. Article 1 stipulates that the two contracting parties mutually agree not to commit acts of aggression or engage in war. Article 2 stipulates that if one of the contracting parties is attacked by a third country, the other contracting party agrees to remain neutral. Article 3 stipulates that neither of the contracting parties shall enter into any understanding with any country with the aim of refusing to purchase or sell the goods of the other contracting party. Neither of the contracting parties may refuse to purchase the goods of the other contracting party, nor may it refuse to sell its own goods to the other contracting party. Article 4 stipulates that both contracting parties shall not engage in propaganda or interfere in the internal affairs of the other contracting party with the aim of overthrowing the existing system by force. Neither of the contracting parties shall condone any organization that claims sovereignty over the territory of the other contracting party. Article 5 stipulates that all disputes between the two contracting parties shall be resolved through peaceful means. The reconciliation procedure shall be discussed and formulated at a later date. Article 6 stipulates that the term of validity of the treaty is set at two years. After the two-year period, either party may request its termination one year in advance. Annex 1: Briand shall exchange documents with the Soviet Russian Ambassador, stating that the treaty shall only take effect after the above-mentioned reconciliation procedure is stipulated by a special treaty. However, Briand immediately gave the Soviet Russian Ambassador assurances that there were no major disputes between France and Soviet Russia. Annex 2: For the purpose of implementing Article 2 of this treaty, France shall regard the following countries as aggressors: (1) Those who refuse to abide by the methods of resolution stipulated in the Kellogg-Briand Pact to resolve disputes; (2) Those who occupy foreign territory and refuse to withdraw despite requests. The Soviet Russian government shall declare its agreement with this view. The Paris Echo reported that these provisions have been sent to Poland, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, and Finland. France has agreed to sign this treaty with Soviet Russia only after the long-discussed Russo-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty has been signed by Soviet Russia. Poland has made the same promise to Romania and the Baltic states. The newspaper also stated that the treaty does not benefit the Kellogg-Briand Pact and can be considered redundant. Furthermore, Article 3 of the treaty contains dangers and must be guarded against. The article stipulates that neither of the contracting parties shall jointly adopt protective measures economically with other countries. If the Soviet Russian Five-Year Plan were to exert coercion in the future, France would be helpless.</p>
<h3>All-Russian Central Conference</h3>
<p>Speech by Chairman of the Far Eastern Region, Bu Zengke</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Moscow, 20th – The All-Russian Central Executive Committee held a meeting here today. Bu Zengke, Chairman of the Far Eastern Region, spoke at the meeting, detailing the development of industry and agriculture in the Soviet Russian coastal provinces, stating that the Soviet Russian Far Eastern provinces have been transformed from Russian imperial colonies into an integral part of Soviet Russia. All ethnic groups within enjoy the same freedom as the people of western, northern, and southern Russia. There have been many disputes in the coastal provinces, but thanks to the Soviet Russian policy of peace and the resolute response to all dangers, the defenses on the Soviet Russian Far Eastern border have been consolidated. Next, he described the economic progress of the provinces, stating that in the past four years, farmland has increased from 1,522,500 acres to 2,500,000 acres, and will increase by another 3,100,000 acres next year. Next, he described the development of industry, stating that in recent years, the production of timber and fisheries has increased sharply year by year. Next, he described the development of culture in the region, stating that before the European War, almost all residents in the region were illiterate. In 1923, the number of illiterate people decreased to 63%, and now it has fallen to 35%. During the imperial era, there were only 54 schools in the entire region. This year, 95% of children of school age are enrolled. This year alone, a total of 854 new primary schools and 57 secondary schools have been established.</p>
<h3>French Premier Declares Support for the Young Plan</h3>
<p>Consistently Opposes Sacrificing Reparations</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 20th – French Premier Laval declared directly in a speech today that France would never be so unwise as to accept a hopeful proposal from the Disarmament Conference that would damage national security. French military spending is now entirely for national defense, not for aggression. The suggestion of canceling war debts and reparations is a reckless theory. France will never allow the Young Plan to be abandoned. French representatives attending the reparations conference will state from the outset that the assessment of Germany's position can only be limited to the current period of economic panic that Germany is experiencing. France will consistently oppose sacrificing reparations for the benefit of private debts. Germany's ability to pay debts is currently under consideration by the Basel International Committee, but no decision has been made yet. The Disarmament Conference is scheduled to be held in February next year, but there is much speculation about how its progress will be affected by the Sino-Japanese dispute over Manchuria.</p>
<h3>Yokohama Specie Bank Suffers Large Losses in Exchange</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo – It is rumored that the Yokohama Specie Bank sold approximately 510 million yen in gold between September 21st, when Britain suspended the gold standard, and mid-October, rather than just 334 million yen as claimed by former Finance Minister Ishii. The banking community was shocked by this news. This morning, it was reported that the previous government did not announce the actual amount of sales in order to strengthen the Japanese currency. The Yokohama Specie Bank does not admit or deny this statement. It is reported that the Yokohama Specie Bank has already shipped out 334 million yen in cash. Although the remaining 170 million yen has been sold, it has not been shipped out. The current price of the Japanese currency is 30% lower than the price before the gold embargo was announced. The Yokohama Specie Bank will lose 50 million yen in exchange. However, since this was done in accordance with the instructions of the previous government transmitted by the Bank of Japan, it is expected that the government, the Bank of Japan, and the Yokohama Specie Bank will share the loss equally.</p>
<h3>Australian Prime Minister Scullin Resigns</h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, Melbourne, 21st – After the Labor government and the Labor Party suffered a crushing defeat in the Australian general election, Prime Minister Scullin resigned today. When submitting his resignation to the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, he recommended Lyons, the leader of the Nationalist Party. The Nationalist Party won a landslide victory in this election and became the majority party in Parliament. It is expected that Lyons will take office as Prime Minister and form a new cabinet. Lyons previously served as the Postmaster-General, Minister of Public Works and Railways, etc. in the Labor cabinet. Later, he disagreed with Scullin and formed a new party, which led to the dissolution of the previous Parliament and this new election. The Labor cabinet was formed in October 1929 and remained in office for more than two years.</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>A telegram from the Capital Garrison Command: To all newspapers, regarding the report in today's Shanghai newspapers that during the student demonstration in the capital on the 17th of this month, more than twenty students died and about sixty are missing. This is completely inconsistent with the facts. After the students' demonstration on the 17th destroyed the Central Daily News building, they were about to set it on fire when the military police came out to stop them. The students refused and clashed with them. Dozens of military police were injured, and four students were pushed into the water. Three of them were rescued, but one unfortunately drowned, which is deeply regrettable. This matter has been investigated and photographed by the court for burial. None of the other students died, and after the students were dispersed, they all returned to their schools. None of them are missing. At present, the diplomatic situation is urgent, and reactionary elements often distort the truth and take advantage of the opportunity to cause trouble. Slight inaccuracies in reporting can easily lead to accidents. Therefore, we are submitting a detailed account of the facts to clarify the truth and request that you publish it immediately to correct misunderstandings. Capital Garrison Command.</p>

After about half an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy retreated, with the death of several sergeant majors and cavalry soldiers. On the Black Army side, one company deputy died and five soldiers were wounded. Yesterday morning (the 15th), a column of enemy armored vehicles arrived at Tahar Station. The bridge there had already been repaired by Japanese engineers and South Manchuria Railway workers, so the armored vehicles had the potential to cross the bridge. Cheng Zhiyuan, the commander of the 8th Brigade and Cavalry Commander, went to Hailun to consult with Ma Zhanshan. Ma ordered the troops in the front to retreat and gather between Fuhaicheng and Ningnian Station, to work together to defend the area. He also ordered Cheng Zhiyuan to rush back to Keshan on the 15th to take charge of everything. Last night, a unit of Japanese cavalry was discovered near Bajiazi, Fengtian Village, near Taianzhen, with the appearance of attacking Taian and cutting off the rear of our troops stationed in Ningnian. Before departing, Cheng Zhiyuan urgently telegraphed Zhou Zuolin's regiment in Taian, urging them to send scouts to investigate, and also dispatched two companies of cavalry to search. It is faintly heard that the Japanese army fears the cold weather in the north, and their military plans are not progressing as desired. They also fear a counterattack by the Black Army, so they are especially harassing our troops with small units of cavalry, so that our troops are unable to attend to everything and have no strength to counterattack. Therefore, each time they harass, there are no large units. This is the plan for the front of the Qiqihar-Koshan Railway line. As for our 55th Artillery Regiment stationed in Lindian County, it has been repeatedly pressured by the enemy. On the evening of the 13th, the Japanese army even launched a surprise attack on our third battalion position with more than 500 cavalry. The attack was very fierce, and after fighting for an hour, it was finally repelled by our troops, with more than 20 enemy soldiers killed. In recent days, Japanese aircraft, due to the cold weather, have not been able to fly and maneuver as desired, so our troops in various defensive positions have suffered less from bombing. Lindian County is located opposite the Qiqihar-Koshan Railway line, and our troops on the Qiqihar-Koshan Railway line have a mutually reinforcing relationship. The reason why the Japanese army is trying so hard to attack is to force our troops to retreat and move, but we are also fully defending it due to the situation, so as to prevent the Qiqihar-Koshan Railway line from being under pressure. Ma Zhanshan's newly formed student regiment is led by Yuan Chonggu, commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade, with its headquarters in Baiquan. The quota is set to recruit 1,500 people, limited to junior high school graduates or those with equivalent qualifications, aged between 18 and 25 years old. Within less than a week of the announcement of the recruitment news, more than 700 people were recruited, all of whom were students from various places who came to enlist. There were also many female students who came from Qiqihar and Hailun to request enlistment, but were unable to be accepted due to regulations. The formation of this knowledgeable and energetic youth force has greatly excited Ma Zhanshan's entire force. Therefore, many bandits and Jilin troops from various places have heard the news and come to enlist. In recent days, approximately 2,000 bandits gathered between Heihe, Xi'an, and Guangda, have been recruited by Jiao's regiment from Anda Station and sent to Hailun for review. Jilin troops stationed on the Harbin-Changchun and Harbin-Manzhouli lines are also deserting with their weapons to Hailun every day. With this replenishment, the strength of the Black Army is not much different from its pre-war strength. As for Ma Zhanshan himself, rumors spread by outsiders that he has compromised with the Japanese side are absolutely untrue. Ma's military preparations and will have not changed in the slightest. However, since the domestic authorities have not expressed any positive attitude towards Japan, Ma does not dare to launch a counterattack rashly, because even if he retakes Qiqihar, the Japanese army will definitely increase its troops to attack, and the result will be that the lone army will fight and make unnecessary sacrifices. Regarding the matter of meeting with Japanese Chief of Staff Itagaki, Ma immediately sent a detailed telegram expressing his feelings. A few days ago, Ma said to people, "When the army first set out and arrived at Maguxi Station, three teenagers (thirteen or fourteen years old) carried a hundred catties of beef to reward the army. I asked where they got the money, and they replied that it was accumulated from their monthly expenses. I asked if they were not afraid of their families' condemnation for doing this, and they replied that everyone has a patriotic heart, and they are not afraid even if they are condemned. It was impossible to refuse them, so I accepted the meat and rewarded them with twenty yuan, which they reluctantly accepted. When the army arrived at Hetao, these three teenagers carried beef again, saying that they had bought it with the reward, hoping that the general would work hard to kill the enemy and eat more of this meat. I was moved to tears when I heard this. Although I am willing to be responsible to the country and the Northeast, how dare I be responsible to these three teenagers?" Ma plans to go to Baiquan around the 20th to inspect the defenses again. Zhang Jinghui is still not going to Qiqihar. Today, he sent Ying Shun to Qiqihar again to represent Zhang and the maintenance committee to temporarily handle all affairs and maintain the status quo in Qiqihar. The eighteen representatives from Heilongjiang Province who came to Harbin to welcome Zhang returned yesterday and today. (16th)</p>
<h3>Central Government and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>▲ Chen Mingshu Emphasizes Spirit of Unity</p>
<p>▲ Lin Sen Lectures on "Fraternal Spirit"</p>
<p>▲ Central Party Headquarters: On the morning of the 21st, the Central Party Headquarters held the fifth weekly memorial service for the late Premier. Attendees included Wu Jingheng, Chen Mingshu, Shao Yuan Chong, Chen Guofu, and over six hundred staff members. Chairman Chen Guofu presided over the ceremony. Following the formalities, Chen Mingshu reported that the unity that the entire party has been hoping for, and the unification that the people of the entire nation have been seeking, have now been concretely realized. This is such a critical juncture, as we are facing a crisis of both internal troubles and external aggression pressing upon us. It is only because all comrades were able to be sincerely fraternal, modest, and self-reproaching that division was transformed into unity, and discord was dissolved into harmony. In particular, Mr. Chiang's advocacy of the spirit of deference is a model for the entire world. We cannot help but pay him our respects. In history, political proposals, whether for contention or reputation, must all weigh the interests of the nation and the people. Therefore, one cannot be rigidly attached to one extreme. However, it must be known that twenty years have passed since the founding of the Republic of China, and politics have still not been put on the right track. The people's livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult, and the national strength is becoming increasingly strained. The fundamental reason is that internal warfare has not ceased for years. Therefore, if we want to put politics on the right track, to ease the people's livelihood and expand the national strength, we must refrain from using force as a tool for political struggle. For political struggle that resorts to force has already deviated from the normal path. If fortunate, it will be a revolution that accords with Heaven and responds to the people. If unfortunate, it will be an internal strife for the seizure of power, leading to national disaster. The point has been reached where military force cannot resist foreign aggression, which is already an indelible disgrace. Unless one is mad or deranged, how can one bear to resort to force again to seek political gain? Even if there were no current national crisis, the state of the nation is such that it cannot withstand another such inauspicious internal war. Therefore, the humility and self-reproach of all comrades today, and the realization of peaceful unification, is a necessary obligation. We pray that it becomes a permanent reality, and that there should be no trace of reluctance or doubt. Given the complexity of social figures and the intricate nature of political phenomena, even within a single party, differences in political views are inevitable. To address these differences, resorting to the resolution of power organs is the only proper procedure. This time, the leaders of our party have established a model of resolving political disputes through peaceful and legal procedures, based on humility and self-reproach to seek unity, in order to permanently establish a standard model. We must exert all our strength and be loyal to achieve this. Fellow comrades, although the unity of our party has fortunately been realized, looking back at the current environment, Japanese imperialists are invading and occupying various places in the Northeast, and the Red bandits are wreaking havoc in the provinces of Jiangxi, Hubei, Anhui, and Henan. We have a disease of the head and also a trouble in the heart. A slight negligence and the disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction will be upon us. Within our party, unity is certainly a necessary move, but the unity of the entire nation and the combination of the government and the people is also an urgent need. Moreover, this kind of unity and combination must be made a factual and organized reality. The recent convocation of the National Crisis Conference is for this purpose, to gather the strength of the entire nation to resist foreign aggression. In my humble opinion, all people from all walks of life who do not violate the interests of the nation hope to organize and establish it with appropriate representatives following proper procedures. There should be a discussion in the conference that fits the facts and assumes responsibility, and after the resolution, no one should evade or doubt, and steps should be taken in unison to fight the enemy with a common hatred. If we want to regain the lost rights, then everyone must have a resolve to die. All virtuous talents outside the party who are interested in politics should provide benevolent guidance to form a firm and consistent unity, and go together to face the national crisis to save the precarious situation. The students of the entire nation are the hope of the nation's destiny. We deeply admire their patriotic enthusiasm. As for the recent occurrence of transgressions in various places, it is actually due to various long-term reasons in diplomacy, education, politics, and party affairs that have accumulated. We also sincerely hope that they will slightly suppress their anger and unite to face foreign aggression, taking proper action as a backing for government diplomacy. At the same time, they should not neglect their studies, so as not to cut off the nation's vitality, and leave the nation in a situation of irrecoverable disaster. As for the reactionary elements who are instigating from within, if the student masses cannot distinguish and guard against them themselves, then in themselves, it is tantamount to showing no ability to ensure internal stability and eliminate harm, and no true spirit of patriotism to resist foreign aggression. Finally, brothers, I have one more thought that I dare to offer to all comrades. Unity, unification, and peace, this is the call of the masses, and it is certainly the best. Unity is indeed strength, but unity is the key to political progress, not the purpose of political progress. It must be known that unity is originally for the benefit of the nation and the people, not just for the consolidation of the political power of our party. Unity is originally for the permanence of political power, and jointly and actively serving the party and the country is definitely not for self-preservation by evading responsibility at a time of concern for foreign aggression. We now have strength in unity, and strength is responsibility. The more strength, the more responsibility we should bear. But how can we make this strength condense and expand day by day? How can we use this strength to seek political progress and satisfy the people's demands, so as to realize the most hoped-for goal in the future? It depends on how we strive after our unity. The survival or demise, the fortune or misfortune of the party and the nation depends on the unity of today, but even more on the measures taken after this unity. This is something that we must not fail to expect from our comrades and compatriots, to exert our intelligence and strength, sincerity and patience, and strive to the best of our ability for the future. The surveillance of the world is before us every day. What will future history be like? Fellow comrades, we recall how much sorrow there has been in the past. Those who have sacrificed for the party and the nation for many years, the cries of orphans and widows, the weeping of restless souls, the groans of the people waiting to be rescued, and the misery of national subjugation and racial extinction. Fortunately, the First Plenary Session is about to open, relying on the spirit of the late Premier in heaven, guiding our country's comrades and compatriots to embark on the path of self-rescue and national salvation, and so on. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>▲ National Government: On the same morning, the National Government held a weekly memorial service for the late Premier. Attendees included Lin Sen, Chen Mingshu, Yu Youren, Wang Boqun, He Yaozu, Ma Fuxiang, Shao Lizi, Ru Yuli, Lin Xiang, Chen Qicai, Zhang Wohua, Gao Weiyue, Zhu Lühe, and others. Chairman Lin Sen reported after the formalities that today, I will report on the late Premier's teachings, the "Fraternal Spirit, Sincerity, and Earnestness" – an interpretation of these four characters. There are narrow and broad definitions. The narrow definition can be skipped today, and we will only discuss the broad definition. Since ancient times, China's establishment as a nation, as well as the survival of humanity, has relied on the four characters "Fraternal Spirit, Sincerity, and Earnestness" to maintain people's hearts and establish a foundation. If we can truly practice the broad definition of "Fraternal Spirit, Sincerity, and Earnestness," the nation will surely achieve peace and prosperity. The source of these four characters is not something that has only been invented recently. Ancient people have already spoken of it. China has always said that regulating the family, governing the country, and pacifying the world are all based on "Fraternal Spirit, Sincerity, and Earnestness." The current trend thinks that this is an old saying. In fact, saying that it is an old saying is too superficial. I believe that whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, this is the right path. If the whole country can be fraternal, then there will be no suspicion. If there is no suspicion, then there will be no jealousy. If there is no jealousy, then we can cooperate sincerely. Regulating the family, governing the country, and pacifying the world can all be achieved. The late Premier taught us with these four characters, and we should strive to practice and abide by them. If someone thinks that this is a good term and that new trends should be brought out, I think this is very worthy of research. Morality has no concept of old or new. Just as we use our eyes to see things at any time and in any place, we cannot say that we use our ears to see things. Morality without fraternity is not morality. People without fraternity are not humanity. As for the late Premier's revolutionary new morality of universal love, freedom, and equality, there must first be universal love, then there can be freedom. To have freedom, one must not infringe upon the freedom of others, which is fraternity. Now that the national crisis is at hand and the situation is very serious, I especially report on the four characters "Fraternal Spirit, Sincerity, and Earnestness" taught by the late Premier, hoping that everyone will earnestly practice them. The realization of the Three Principles of the People can be achieved. I offer this as encouragement to myself and to all comrades.</p>
<h3>Students Petitioning in Yanzhou Disperse</h3>
<p>▲ Jinpu Railway Traffic Resumes</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Students from various schools in southern Shandong gathered in Yanzhou to wait for trains to go to Beijing, causing disturbances for several days, which had not been resolved. According to a phone call from Yanzhou today (the 20th), all railway staff at the station have now returned to their posts. A group of students, because the student petitioning delegation returning from Beijing passed through Yanzhou last night and told them about the situation in Beijing, the enthusiasm to go to Beijing is not as strong as before. In addition, after the hard persuasion of people from all walks of life and Gu Liangmin, the students were greatly moved and held repeated meetings to discuss solutions. As a result, more than three hundred students from the Taian Provincial Third Middle School and the County Normal School were willing to return to Taian and have been sent back by the station. There are still more than one hundred people left in Yanzhou. Students from Jining No. 7 Middle School are also willing to go back. However, some students from Qufu No. 2 Normal School still insisted on going to Beijing. Therefore, this afternoon, students from various schools are still in the meeting. As long as the students from Qufu No. 2 Normal School no longer insist, then the students from Mingde Middle School in that county can return to Qufu at the same time. Students from Jining No. 7 Middle School can also go back. The Fourth Rural Normal School and the Third Vocational School students in Yanzhou are nearby, which is not a problem. Now, on the Jinpu Railway, since the students are about to disperse, traffic can be restored. Last night's southbound train, the Jinan Station has already sold Pukou tickets. (20th)</p>
<h3>Changsha Students Negotiate with Party Newspaper</h3>
<p>▲ Triggered by the Zhongshan Daily's Article "Busy with Meetings to Save the Country"</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After the establishment of the Hunan Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps, they are extremely nervous about the patriotic movement. Recently, because the Shimin Daily and the Wan Wan Bao published slightly different views on the issue of checking goods and the tragic killing of students by the Xiangtan Public Security Bureau, the students are extremely dissatisfied and have petitioned the provincial party headquarters for punishment, which has not yet been resolved. Unexpectedly, the Zhongshan Daily, run by the provincial party headquarters, published an article in the supplement column on the 15th of this month, satirizing the students, titled "Busy with Meetings to Save the Country." The content said that since the unfortunate incident in the Northeast, the Chinese people, who had been living in a drunken stupor day and night, suddenly became excited and treated patriotism as a specialized career. Taking Changsha as an example, the so-called anti-Japanese national salvation organizations are no less than thirty or forty. In addition to the Hunan People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and the Hunan Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, there are also the anti-Japanese national salvation associations spontaneously organized by various schools and institutions, such as the Four-Person National Salvation Group, the Five-Person National Salvation Group, the Ten-Person National Salvation Group, the Su Guangye Traitor Elimination Group, the No. 1 Middle School No. 7 Normal School National Salvation Group, the No. 1 Middle School Conscience National Salvation Group, the No. 1 Middle School Ordinary Class 8 National Salvation Group, the No. 2 Middle School Ordinary Class 1 National Salvation Group, the No. 2 Middle School No. 6 Normal School National Salvation Group...and so on. In the 24 hours of a day, except for sleeping and eating, there are probably only more than eight hours. If you have to publicize to the masses or attend meetings somewhere every day, no matter what, it takes at least three or four hours. Isn't it sighing that our life is finite, but the publicity meetings are endless? However, there are still a group of gentlemen who cannot awaken themselves and are still saving others, taking the opportunity to flirt with people, show off, extort money, escape from studying, and escape from exams. There are quite a few, friends, if you are truly patriotic, then you must work hard in the laboratory, find a way out in the library, and find methods in science. Because not being practical and only singing high-sounding tunes will never save the country. This article was seen by students from the Provincial First and Second Middle Schools, who believed that it was undermining the patriotic movement and caused public outrage. After discussion by the student associations of the two schools, it was decided that the No. 1 Middle School would send 17 representatives and the No. 2 Middle School would send 10 representatives to the provincial party headquarters on the morning of the 16th to request strict punishment of the editor of the Zhongshan Daily and to directly question the Zhongshan Daily. At 10 a.m., the student representatives from the two schools formed a team and went to the Zhongshan Daily, surrounded the newspaper office, and put forward the following conditions to the newspaper authorities: (1) Hand over the supplement editor Li Kongxing and the contributor. (2) It must be corrected in tomorrow's newspaper and apologize in writing to the student associations of the First and Second Middle Schools. The editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Chen Jieshi, came out to receive them and admitted that (1) he would submit a request to the provincial party headquarters to dismiss the supplement editor Li Kongxing, and Li would write a letter to apologize to the students of the two schools. (2) Corrected statement in tomorrow's (17th) newspaper. (3) The contributor is Wang Chu from the Provincial First Middle School, with a name stamp on the bottom draft, and it was written on a First Middle School exam paper, promising to hand over the bottom draft to Yu Xianli, the principal of the First Middle School, for investigation. The student side was satisfied, and the matter could have come to an end. However, the Hunan Student Anti-Japanese Association held a temporary executive committee meeting on the afternoon of the 16th to discuss the matter and decided to submit a request to the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Headquarters for the following measures: 1. Warn the editor-in-chief of the newspaper. 2. Dismiss and severely punish the supplement editor. 3. Publish an apology in the newspaper and in writing. 4. Hand over the contributor. 5. Guarantee that there will be no more absurd remarks that undermine the national salvation movement in the future. Xiao Yishi and four others were appointed as representatives to go to the provincial party headquarters for negotiations. As a result, the press also had a reaction. On the 17th, He Jian received all the news reporters in the general headquarters, and Tang Yaozhang and others reported the matter face to face and asked He to forward it to the provincial party headquarters to withdraw the dismissal of the supplement editor of the Zhongshan Daily. Liu Zhongdi, the acting editor-in-chief of the Zhongshan Daily, also reported the situation of the students surrounding the newspaper office that day and asked for justice. He Jian said that he had read the published manuscript and there was nothing wrong with it. Unexpectedly, the students surrounded the newspaper office directly, which was very inappropriate. At the beginning of the incident on the 16th, he had called Huang, the director of the Education Department, and Yu and Wu, the principals of the two schools, and ordered them to stop it, but he could not find them all. After reading the newspaper on the 17th, he realized that the editor had been replaced and he also believed that right and wrong were unclear. Since the case had been reported to the provincial party headquarters for handling, he would consult with the members and there would be a fair solution. It is feared that there will still be some twists and turns in this matter. (18th)</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Court Hearing of the Tang Helong Murder Case: Tang Zhikui, the owner of Tang Helong Oil and Hemp Shop in Dacang Bridge, was brutally assassinated on the night of September 5 last year. Although there were various discussions at the time, there were no clues to be found, so it became a suspicious case. On October 6 of this year, the county public security bureau captured Ji Qie Shen Shaoqing, a habitual thief who had escaped from prison, who confessed that the Tang case was initiated by his son Tang Daguan, who invited two unnamed fugitives and me to kill him. After the public security bureau confessed, Tang Ziqiusheng was summoned and sent to the county court. After repeated interrogations by the prosecutor, a public prosecution was filed. At 9:00 a.m. today, the court opened a public trial. Tang Qiusheng hired two teachers, Zhang Baopei and Wang Tinggan, to appear in court to defend him. Then, the criminal court's investigator Zhang came to court and the prosecutor also came to court to perform his duties. Shen Shaoqing's confession was completely contrary to previous court confessions, claiming that he had listened to the instigation of others, so he confessed in the investigation court that Tang Qiusheng had initiated the instigation. Now that his conscience has been discovered, there is no such thing, and he has never had any contact with Tang Qiusheng. Tang Qiusheng also denied the allegation and said that my nickname was not called Daguan. After the interrogation, the officer ordered that the case still needs to be investigated, and ordered each to return to prison to wait for the witnesses to be summoned for further interrogation. Later, lawyer Zhang said that Tang Qiusheng is no longer suspected of this case and should be released on bail. The interrogator did not approve it due to the seriousness of the case. The court adjourned at noon at 12:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Dispute over the Boundary Demarcation of Taiping Township: The case of the Fengnan boundary demarcation, after the review of the Ministry of the Interior, recognized that the Taiping Township section of Nanhui was indeed the same as the provisions of Article 7 of the Outline for Reorganizing County Districts. Therefore, it has been ordered by the Civil Affairs Department to appoint inspectors Lu Yonghuang, who came to Feng last day before yesterday to investigate. In order to express the will of the people, the people of the district immediately convened a mass meeting, unanimously advocating the annexation of Fengxian, and elected representatives to meet with the provincial committee and ask for a decision. Unexpectedly, the opponents, seeing the public's determination, forcibly forced the chairman of the conference, Pan Chengjiang (the town mayor of Nandadaqiao), to sign an opposition, and at the same time, they also destroyed the house of He Baoyi, who was pushed to petition, causing public outrage and a major conflict. Later, the water police sent a team to suppress it before it was dispersed. It is now known that the perpetrators have been arrested yesterday, including Ma and other three people, and are temporarily detained in the Minhang district for interrogation. On the one hand, the victims He Baoyi and others hired lawyers to file lawsuits according to law.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Organizing a Party Affairs Improvement Association: Party members from various districts of Wuxian, because the Wuxian County Party Department Committee's actions were improper, have resolved to establish a Party Affairs Improvement Committee after a meeting, and elected Yan Yisheng and other fifteen people as members, overthrowing the original party department, and writing to the county government to stop the payment of party fees and engage in the reorganization of the Wuxian County Party Department.</p>
<p>New Trends in the Banquet Donation Dispute: The banquet donation dispute of the restaurant industry has been deadlocked for three months and has not been resolved. After the county chamber of commerce and the county government repeatedly submitted reports to the province for instructions, yesterday (21st) the Civil Affairs Department approved an order, saying that after investigating this case, according to the county magistrate Wu Jiaqing's telegram, the county magistrate Wu Jiaqing's report on the handling process should be based on the fact that the restaurant operators Sun Guichang and others are obviously disputing and resisting donations, which affects tax revenue and is not in the general interest. Now that the bureau has been ordered to release them on bail, they should be dealt with urgently. As for whether Han Huanzhang, who originally undertook the aforementioned banquet donation, has hindered the industry, and whether he should be ordered to withdraw his undertaking and whether the restaurant industry association should elect representatives to undertake it at the original amount to facilitate tax revenue and maintain education funds, it is still pending the approval of the Education Department. The instructions are on file, and I hereby inform the Restaurant Industry Association to directly contact the competent authority to undertake it.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>More Than a Thousand Henan Refugees Move Freely: A total of 1,009 refugees from Wugou and Xihu counties in Henan took 13 civilian boats on the 18th of this month and arrived at Fushan Town from Tonglai Chang. The township district office immediately telegraphed the joint office of military police and Tuan Lian in the urban area, which immediately sent a team to the countryside to suppress them. On the 19th, the team arrived in the township and first distributed 150 yuan of food to the refugees, who then agreed to arrive in Kunshan the next morning (20th). Unexpectedly, the refugees said that if they went to Kunshan, they had to pass through the urban area, which the military police did not allow, and ordered them to reach Taicang via the waterway and transfer to Kunshan. Just when it was undecided, some of the refugees had broken into the house of the Xu family in Gaojiaba, kicked open the door, and moved all the food away. Some of them went to the flour boat and freely took away more than 20 bags of flour and cabbage. There were still two boats that were detained. The victims immediately reported to the military police joint team, announced martial law, went to persuade them, and summoned the four leaders to comfort them. Then, at about 10 o'clock, they were all escorted to the port and ordered to set off immediately. They used the excuse that the tide had receded and requested a delay of one day. The company commander of the garrison immediately telegraphed the city for instructions, and then Battalion Commander Shen telegraphed that a special martial law should be announced, and sentries should be added to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Passengers Drowned on the Dade Ship: After the Dade ship of the Shanghai Dada Shipping Company had an accident outside Baimao Port in Changshu, the company immediately set up a temporary office in Hupu, hired workers to salvage the bodies, and paid 10 yuan for each body found. As of the morning of the 20th, a total of 31 male and female bodies had been salvaged, all of which were blurred and unrecognizable. The district office and the public security bureau jointly ordered the town Ding to number and photograph each body separately, and submitted a request to the Changshu County Government to send someone to inspect them. Except for the body numbered 24, which was claimed by someone wearing a military uniform and requested to be exempted from inspection, the rest were inspected one by one, coffins were purchased, and they were buried.</p>
<p>Wang Hongyu Case to Be Dismissed: Wang Hongyu, the chief of the tenth district of this county, was reported for shooting and killing farmers. The Department of Civil Affairs sent a member, Wu Zezhong, to Chang to investigate. After the report was submitted, the Department of Civil Affairs ordered the county to detain him, and then transferred him to the Wuxian District Court for trial. Qian Yu, the prosecutor commissioned by the Wudi Court, detained the defendant Wang Hongyu, the police team leader Jin Dingxun, and Li Fuqing after an investigation. According to Suxun yesterday, prosecutor Qian has drafted a ruling that Jin Dingxun has confessed in court to ordering the shooting, so he has been prosecuted for the crime of homicide. As for Wang and Li, it is said that there is insufficient evidence and they will be dismissed.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Four Judges of the Court Accused: Shanghai Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. previously sued Liu Depei and others in the Zhenjiang District Court for counterfeiting trademarks. After the judgment, the company found that the judgment written by the judges Zhong Shicheng, Zhou Baochu, Wu Shushan, Jin Shi, etc. openly violated the Trademark Law and cut apart the articles of the Trademark Law. Therefore, it was an entry and exit that violated Article 132 of the Criminal Law, a public official with judicial duties, knowing the law, and deliberately making an entry and exit crime. In addition, the facts determined by the judgment, the judges knew that they were untrue, but still recorded them in the judgment and used them as the basis for the judgment, and also violated Article 230 of the Criminal Law, a public official knowing that they are untrue facts and recording them in official documents in their custody. Facts and evidence are listed in detail and submitted to the Supervision Yuan, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and the Jiangsu Higher Court for investigation and handling. However, the company believes that this item is an administrative punishment, and in the future, it must still be included in the scope of justice. For direct and simple calculations, it is better to formally file a criminal lawsuit. On the 19th, a statement was filed with the Zhenjiang District Court Prosecutor's Office, requesting that the judges be summoned for investigation and a public prosecution be filed in accordance with the law, and at the same time, the Higher Court was petitioned to transfer jurisdiction.</p>

(2) During the suspension period of the county association, various districts and branches must still step up their work, and pay close attention to unscrupulous merchants privately transporting and selling goods of hatred. (3) A telegram was sent requesting the unified government to strictly investigate the tragic killing of students.</p>
<p>Fan Chunchen's Opium Case Appealed: Fan Chunchen, a shareholder of the Deyi Pawnshop in this county, was detained by the court for an opium case reported by others. The former judge Liang sentenced him to one month of imprisonment and a fine of 600 yuan. Later, because Fan was old and sick, he was changed to a fine of 500 yuan. The chief prosecutor, Er Kai, believed that the judgment in this case was inconsistent in many ways, and appealed to the High Court, requesting a legal judgment to be made again. The reasons stated in his appeal were approximately the following three items: 1. How was the sentence of a fine of 600 yuan suddenly changed to 500 yuan? The words "five" and "six" on the original main text have traces of alterations, which are obviously illegal. 2. Fan Chunchen had no signs of illness when he was escorted from the prosecutor's office to the trial court. Why was he suddenly released on bail due to illness at the time of the judgment? This point is especially inappropriate. 3. The prisoner should immediately seek the prosecutor's consent after being released on bail after the judgment in accordance with the law. Why did the trial court not notify the prosecutor's office when Fan Chunchen was released on bail? Teachers Oppose Salary Deduction and Petition: Primary school teachers in urban and rural areas are unable to make ends meet due to limited salaries, and it is difficult to maintain their lives. Although the Education Bureau has slogans of raising salaries with banquet donations and uniform treatment, they are empty promises. The situation has become more serious. They have set a dividing line between qualified and unqualified teachers, deduct salaries on a monthly basis, and force teachers to attend correspondence courses, which has aroused the reaction of various teachers. Yesterday (20th) afternoon at 4:00 p.m., more than 200 people attended a meeting at the Education Association. Chairman Lu Jingshan appointed Pan Yichen, Yao Cang and other eleven people as members of the primary school teachers' self-help committee against salary deduction, Bi Zonghe, Jiang Hanshang and other eleven people as members of the disciplinary team, and appointed Pan Yichen, Ren Gaoben and other five people as petition representatives. At 8:00 p.m., the entire group went to the Education Bureau to petition, putting forward ten requests: (1) Oppose salary deduction for unqualified teachers, oppose forced enrollment in teacher correspondence courses. (2) The Education Bureau must not use salary increases as a slogan, but actually reduce salaries. (3) Announce the accounts of banquet donations. (4) Cancel the established dividing line between qualified and unqualified. (5) Request uniform treatment and tuition fees, and other items are omitted. At that time, Director Lu Renshou was not in the bureau. The teachers waited for a long time before going to the bureau to talk. They mostly accepted the ten requests put forward. The teachers were satisfied and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Expulsion of Teachers and Staff to Oust the Director of the Bureau of Education: The teachers and staff of the local county elementary school had previously stopped teaching for more than forty days due to unpaid salaries. After raising 7,000 yuan, classes were reluctantly resumed yesterday. Currently, the bureau has no definite plan for the remaining arrears. The annual budget for the 20th year is being repeatedly requested for reductions. Therefore, the general education colleagues believe that Director Jia Qihuan is not only unable to raise funds but also disregards their livelihoods and hardships. They believe that he intends to destroy Jiangdu education. Therefore, they unanimously advocated that he must be expelled from the Yangzhou education circle. In recent days, the atmosphere of expelling Jia has been exceptionally strong.</p>
<p>Centenarian in Wanglou Township: Liu, the mother of Wang Deyu and Wang Deqi of Wanglou Township, has reached the age of one hundred, with four generations under one roof. The elderly resident Ling Hongshou reported this to the county, requesting a recommendation to higher authorities for an award. The county believed that although the regulations for commending elderly people had been promulgated, detailed rules had not been issued. It was specially decided to give the "Esteemed Virtue and Advanced Age" plaque as an award from the county.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Continued Records of the Salary Demands by All Teachers and Staff: All teachers and staff in this county are currently facing difficulties in maintaining their livelihoods. The other day, they went to the county government to demand repayment of old debts. Chief Wang received them and agreed to report to the county magistrate for issuance. Yesterday (the 15th) at 5:00 PM, all teachers and staff gathered at the Women's Elementary School. The principals of each school and the directors of various social education institutions went to the county government to hear the news. County Magistrate Li replied that a little would be issued at the end of this month. All teachers and staff were dissatisfied, considering the phrase "a little" to be too vague. They decided to gather again at the Women's Elementary School at 2:00 PM today to discuss solutions.</p>
<p>Anhui Bandits Invade Gaoyou Again: Bian Tang Town in the twelfth district of this county was previously looted by Anhui bandits. The county government ordered troops to suppress and disperse them. It is now reported that these bandits have recently invaded Gaoyou again, looting Chen Guizhuang and Zhi Lizhuang completely. Most of the houses in both villages were burned down. These bandits have not yet retreated and are less than ten miles away from Jinkou Town. Those in the town with some assets are now moving away one after another. Town Mayor Li Kai has requested the county government to quickly send water patrol teams to defend the area.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>Bengbu Implements a Large-Scale Inspection: Bengbu is a place where people from all walks of life gather, both good and bad. Every winter defense season, gun cases occur frequently. The military and police authorities believe that during this period of martial law, local security is particularly important. At the winter defense meeting held at the Military and Police Supervisory Office the other day, it was decided to implement a large-scale inspection. Yesterday (the 19th), the heads of various military and police agencies, as well as members of the district party headquarters and the Chamber of Commerce, held another secret meeting at the Supervisory Office to discuss the implementation of inspection methods. The inspection area was divided into five major districts according to the police district, each district divided into two or three sections, and each section divided into several groups. The inspection was carried out from 6:30 AM today (the 20th) and was completed throughout the town by 11:00 AM. Statistics show that 97 scattered soldiers and vagrants were captured and detained at the Supervisory Office. One hundred and thirty-eight thieves, kidnappers, and suspicious persons were captured and transferred to the Public Security Bureau by each district office for detention. A large number of military supplies were also seized and confiscated. At 2:00 PM, the military and police authorities and members of the party headquarters and the Chamber of Commerce held a meeting at the Supervisory Office to discuss how to deal with the arrested criminals. It is reported that a joint trial committee will be formed to conduct separate trials. All scattered soldiers and vagrants will be escorted out of the area. Thieves, kidnappers, and suspicious persons will be dealt with according to the severity of their crimes in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3>The Necessary Improvements in Educational Facilities for Primary and Secondary Schools Under the Aggressive Invasion of Brutal Japan (Continued) (Wu Zengjie)</h3>
<p>To enable children to have the strength to save the nation, the following points must be emphasized in the facilities for primary school education:</p>
<p>1.  Implementing Health Education Conscientiously: Children's bodies have not yet fully developed. During this period, health must be emphasized. "A sound mind dwells in a sound body" is a very valuable motto. Health education is not just about teachers talking about it orally, emphasizing the importance of hygiene, or telling hygiene stories or holding a sports meet. Concrete measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Set Up More Equipment to Strengthen the Body: This refers to game equipment and sports equipment. No matter how tight the school's budget is, game and sports equipment must be purchased. Because with equipment, it can stimulate children and arouse their interest in games and sports.</p>
<p>(2) Closely Contact Families and Pay Attention to Children's Nutrition: Nutrition is very important for physical health. Teachers should closely contact parents and pay attention to children's diet and daily life.</p>
<p>(3) Conduct More Physical Examinations and Health Checkups: The purpose of health education, on the positive side, is to make children's bodies strong; on the negative side, is to ensure that children have no diseases and have the ability to resist diseases. Children's bodies, whether good or bad, should be checked regularly. If any adverse phenomena are found, take measures to treat them immediately or notify parents to take measures.</p>
<p>(4) Implement Boy Scout Training Conscientiously: According to the central government's announced outline of volunteer military education, primary and secondary schools must organize boy scout volunteer armies. Boy Scout is a very good training method. It can not only train the body but also cultivate good morals. Boy Scout activities, such as camping and swimming, are all good ways to exercise the body. In Japanese schools, there are "fasting" training, field training, etc., which are really good training methods. Although we do not have to do this, Boy Scout activities must be implemented conscientiously.</p>
<p>(5) Sports Should Focus on Universality, Not Geniuses: When a sports meet is held in primary schools, they often focus on selecting athletes, rather than focusing on the number of participants, which is a mistake. Know that everyone must pay attention to sports. The school promotes sports not to train athletes, but to enable children to exercise their bodies. Sports in primary schools must pay attention to the degree of children's development. Otherwise, it will often damage the body due to sports.</p>
<p>2. Cultivating the Habit of Using Hands and Brain: To make the country rich and strong, it is necessary to increase production. Primary school children certainly cannot talk about production skills, but they must lay the foundation for production. To lay this foundation, children must have the habit of using their hands and brains. Using the brain often means thinking often; using the hands often means being able to do it practically. Regarding this point, it can be divided into the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Cultivate Children's Interest in Studying Science: Primary schools should focus on teaching natural science to cultivate children's love of nature, study of nature, and the ability to use nature to transform the environment.</p>
<p>(2) Emphasize Experiments and Field Observation: The knowledge that children gain from field experiments and observations is genuine. The teaching of natural science cannot rely on oral instruction. Children should be allowed to experiment more to cultivate children's attitude of seeking truth and observing and researching. The instruments and specimens in natural science are as important as the sports and game equipment in physical education. Therefore, no matter how difficult the school's finances are, the necessary instruments and specimens in natural science must be purchased.</p>
<p>3. Cultivating the Spirit of Hard Work and Endurance: When children's bodies are strong, they can naturally endure hardship. There are many tasks in primary schools. If children can do them, they may as well be allowed to do them. Schools should minimize the use of school workers as a principle. Usually, a large part of the work in the school is done by hired school workers. Children only take turns being on duty, which seems too little and needs to be reformed.</p>
<p>In addition to the three points mentioned above, the following things must also be implemented conscientiously:</p>
<p>4. Run a Children's Newspaper: Children will not have a very deep impression of the knowledge they gain from reading or listening, and they will not feel interested. Therefore, use pictures to show the atrocities of Japan and the various tasks of saving the country. This children's newspaper is published every three days, edited by teachers, and children are also responsible for contributing.</p>
<p>5. Conduct More Public Assembly Training: Training in group life is also a necessary task. Primary schools should hold more assembly training to cultivate children's habits of punctuality and discipline. After this habit is formed, they will be law-abiding citizens when they go to society, and they will also be good members who abide by group rules when they enter secondary schools.</p>
<p>There is a lot of work to be done in resisting Japan and saving the country. Comrades who run primary school education, in the future, do not just do the work of instilling knowledge in children, but cultivate children's strength to save the country. What is strength? It is: (1) a strong body, (2) the habit of using hands and brains, and (3) the spirit of hard work and endurance. I hope everyone will work hard.

<h3>The Shanghai Middle School Student Anti-Japanese Federation Yesterday Telegraphed the Executive and Supervisory Committee Members of the Fourth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>▲Presented Six Points of Humble Opinion Requesting Adoption</p>
<p>丨Sent a Letter to the Principals Requesting Facilitation of Promotion and Graduation Issues丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation telegraphed the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session yesterday and presented six points of humble opinion, requesting adoption. It will also hold a memorial service at Puyi Society on the 26th of this month to commemorate the compatriots who were killed while demonstrating in Beijing. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Congratulatory Telegram on the Opening of the Session Transferred by the Secretariat of the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Session to All Executive and Supervisory Committee Members: The country is unfortunate, internal strife is frequent, foreign aggression is imminent, and people's livelihood is declining. Recently, the brutal Japanese have committed arson, murder, rape, and looting, and their cruelty is inhuman. The northeast half of the country is almost completely occupied. The shocking news has spread, and the whole country is boiling. People's emotions are激昂and慷慨得未曾有. Unexpectedly, the government turned a deaf ear. Fortunately, the advanced members of the party and the country, recognizing the danger of national and ethnic peril, have unanimously put aside their prejudices, united in spirit, and are achieving peace and unification. The First Plenary Session of the Fourth Session is the overall mechanism for the country's political reform and renewal, and it is related to long-term stability. In addition to solemnly congratulating your session on behalf of the 100,000 middle school students in Shanghai, our association also presents its humble opinion (1) Recapture the lost territories by force (2) Announce policy plans (3) Implement revolutionary diplomacy (4) Conscientiously implement national military education (5) Oppose the arrival of the League of Nations investigation team in China (6) There should be a fair expression and solution to the tragic events that occurred during the students' demonstration in Beijing. We sincerely hope that you will adopt them for public convenience. The telegram is urgent, and we are extremely apprehensive. Shanghai Middle School Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation kowtows.</p>
<p>▲Letter to Each School: Regarding the decision made by the Ninth Representative Assembly of this association, due to the impact of the strike on the school term exams, please request that each school provide facilitation for the promotion and graduation issues of students, as recorded. This strike was actually to urge the government to send troops to resist Japan and to awaken compatriots due to the critical national situation and the increasingly dangerous diplomatic situation. Therefore, this was a last resort. Before the goal is achieved, this association is determined to fight to the end. However, some of our students, due to environmental relations and the sacrifice of spiritual time, cannot accept any more sacrifices. Therefore, we have to request that the school authorities provide facilitation. We believe that resisting Japan and saving the country is the common goal of everyone, and teachers should also sympathize with us.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Economic Committee of the association is scheduled to hold its twelfth meeting at the association's office at 9:00 AM today. It is estimated that the following schools will attend: Tongde, Shanghai Women's Middle School, Qingxin Women's Middle School, Gongshi, Quanzhang, Yuqing, Qixiu Women's Middle School, Guanghua Affiliated Middle School, Qingxin, etc.</p>
<h3>University Students Go to Beijing to Petition for the Release of Compatriots in Distress</h3>
<p>More than 30 universities in this city each sent two representatives yesterday. At 11 o'clock, they gathered at the North Railway Station and took the night express train to Beijing at 11:30 to negotiate with the central government for the release of the arrested students and to bring back the bodies of the deceased compatriots.</p>
<h3>University Student Federation Hosts the Press</h3>
<p>▲Report on the Situation of the Demonstration in Beijing</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of various universities hosted reporters at the Law School at 2:00 PM yesterday to report on the situation in Beijing and other matters. Many reporters from various newspapers, news agencies, and weekly publications attended. First, Shen Zubei of the Law School reported on the situation in Beijing, followed by Yuan Yiqun of Jiaotong University, who reported on nine points: (1) The Central News Agency deliberately promoted that we were being used by others, but we believe that no one will believe this statement. (2) Instead of preventing us with blank shots in front, we were charged with bayonets and bamboo sticks, hitting us head-on. Was this intentional massacre? (3) Why did they open fire to prevent the rescue teams of students? Was this an attempt to conceal the massacre? (4) Soldiers and police in the Central University were shedding tears for the same deceased students, but the senior authorities still cruelly forced the students to disperse with guns and ropes and did not allow them to take back the bodies. (5) Our return is not a surrender, but because we have no real strength to resist in Nanjing. It is better to return to Shanghai, where we can continue to fight freely. (6) The reactionary slogans and leaflets are all slanderous. (7) Therefore, we confirm that this planned massacre should be the responsibility of the government. Then, various reporters answered questions one after another, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Xiamen University Petition Delegation Hosts the Press</h3>
<p>▲Failed to Go to Beijing Last Night</p>

Moreover, the 160 members of the delegation failed to go to the station last night because the vehicles had not yet been properly arranged.</p>
<h3>Fudan Experimental Middle School Teachers and Students Retain Shao Lizi</h3>
<p>▲Fudan University Apologizes to Xu Zeyu</p>
<p>▲Classes are Scheduled to Resume on the 24th</p>
<p>Since Shao Lizi took charge of the Fudan Experimental Middle School, he has been keen on reform. On the 15th of this month, dozens of university students suddenly attacked Xu, the secretary of the middle school. Shao and Xu both firmly resigned. The students of the school immediately convened a general assembly and unanimously retained them. The teachers and staff of the school also held a general assembly and resolved to ask the university department to maintain the safety of the middle school. Two representatives were elected on the spot to visit Secretary Xu at the hospital and went to Beijing to retain Director Shao. Li Denghui, the president of Fudan University, personally went to the hospital to apologize and comfort Xu and asked Lin Jiyong, the dean of the School of Science, to go to Beijing to ask Shao to withdraw his resignation.</p>
<p>According to a letter from the President's Office of Fudan University, "Mr. Editor of Shen Bao, I am writing to inform you that on the morning of the 15th of this month, Mr. Xu Zeyu, a teacher and secretary of our school, was insulted by several students. The incident was a temporary misunderstanding. The news reported the next day did not match the facts. Our school is currently thoroughly investigating this case. In addition to expressing our apologies to Mr. Xu, we should ask your newspaper to correct the previous news."</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the Fudan Experimental Middle School's Anti-Japanese Conference decided to officially resume classes this Thursday (December 24).</p>
<h3>China Education Construction Society Meeting</h3>
<p>The China Education Construction Society held an emergency meeting at the high school department of the Provincial Shanghai Middle School at 1:00 PM yesterday (the 20th). More than 50 members attended, including Cheng Kuanzheng, Lu Shao, Guo Renquan, Ding Jing, Zhang Zhong, Xu Wancheng, Wu Ziqian, Qiu Xuexun, Xu Zhengji, Long Zhaofo, and Song Bingqin. Sun Yuanzeng presided over the meeting, and Gao Zhisheng recorded the minutes. The chairman briefly stated: "Today's meeting is convened to discuss (1) how to further develop the Society's publication "Era and Education," which has been published to its third issue, with each issue selling more than 10,000 copies; (2) how the Society should express its opinion on the current situation." It was resolved that (1) all members are responsible for soliciting contributions and promoting sales, and Qiu Xuexun, Guo Renquan, and Sun Yuanzeng were elected as the overall responsible persons for editing, and Xu Wancheng and Wu Ziqian were elected as the overall responsible persons for distribution; (2) the Society will implement its propositions, send telegrams to the whole country, promote democratic politics as the foundation of democratic education, protect the dignity of education and not follow the political trend, and protect the independence of education funding. The national military expenditure accounts for more than 80% of the national treasury and cannot resist a single soldier or weapon of imperialism. Education is the foundation of the country, but independent funding is the first and most important step, protecting the lives of teachers and staff from political and bureaucratic influence. This serious declaration will be drafted by the secretariat and announced to the national education community.</p>
<h3>Anhui Shanghai Alumni Association Inaugural Meeting</h3>
<p>The Anhui Shanghai Alumni Association held its inaugural meeting at its office at No. 294 Jinshenfu Road at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. More than 50 members attended. Mao Xiaxuan, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, attended to provide guidance. Tang Shaosong was publicly elected as the chairman, and Wu Jianzhi recorded the minutes.

The alternate executive committee members were Liu Wanxuan, Cheng Silu, Zhang Haiqing, Dong Shaohai, Yuan, Wu Di, and seven others. It is also reported that the first executive committee meeting will be held at the association's office at 1:00 PM this Wednesday (the 23rd), which will be convened by Wang Shuqiao, and it was resolved to hire Gao Yihan, Shi Yun, and Hong Mengchuan as consultants to the association.</p>
<h3>Accountant Wang Yusheng Founds an Accounting Tutoring School</h3>
<p>Accountant Wang, in view of the lack of suitable accounting talents, founded an accounting tutoring school. All the school's operating procedures and organization are in accordance with the regulations and methods for supervising private tutoring schools promulgated by the Ministry of Education. The school has now drafted its constitution and submitted it to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau for approval. Once the approval is received, enrollment will begin immediately. The school is divided into four levels: elementary, intermediate, advanced, and special. Each level is divided into day and night classes, using direct teaching methods, with practice as the basic principle and explanation as a supplement, so that students feel like they are working in a store while taking classes. The school is located at No. 96 Beijing Road, on the fourth floor of the Central Trust Company, in the office of Accountant Wang.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Middle School to Open Soon</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Dai Kuisheng, Qingji, Qiu Hanping, Ma Canhan, and others believe that the oppression of overseas Chinese by the governments of various countries is increasing. The previous laissez-faire approach to overseas Chinese freely establishing schools is now restricted and suppressed with extreme harshness. The impact is that the scale is shrinking, or they are completely suspended. The right of overseas Chinese to education is about to be completely lost. The nationality of overseas Chinese needs to be maintained urgently. Therefore, they have joined forces with enthusiastic overseas Chinese communities to initiate the organization of an Overseas Chinese Middle School, which has been approved by the education authorities. A building at No. 103 Seymour Road has been selected and converted into a school building. The content is spacious, and the equipment is perfect. The start-up and operating expenses are sponsored separately by enthusiastic overseas Chinese from the British, American, Dutch, French, and Japanese territories. It is reported that it will be able to open next January.</p>

<h3>Jiangnan University Football Jiaotong University Wins the Final</h3>

<h3>Last Night's Xiqing Basketball: Shanghai University Defeats Jinnan, Nine Wins Out of Nine</h3>
<p>▲ Sixty-three to Thirty-three丨Jinnan's Yang Shuhui Outstanding</p>
<p>Last night, in the Xiqing basketball game, Shanghai University defeated Jinnan again, achieving a record of nine wins and no losses in nine games. Shanghai University scored nine consecutive points upon entering the court, and Jinnan only scored one point from a free throw to start the record. Shanghai University continued its fierce attack, and Jinnan offered no resistance. The result of the first half was a major victory for Shanghai University with a score of thirty-one to thirteen. From the second half, Jinnan showed a slight improvement, but because the score difference was too large, it was still ineffective, and they were ultimately defeated by a large margin of sixty-three to thirty-three. Jinnan's guard Yang Shuhui performed outstandingly, whether in rebounding or dribbling, she was a cut above the rest, attracting the most attention. However, the team lacked cooperation, and one person alone could not support a collapsing building. The referee was Graham.</p>

<h3>Recollections from Dailiang</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>During the Jiajing era of the Ming Dynasty, Japanese pirates frequently invaded Wuxi. The county magistrate, Wang Qiqin, defended against the enemy, and the facts have been fully recorded. My friend, He Tianjian, is from Wuxi and recounted the following: At that time, in Gujia Village, twenty miles outside the East Gate of Wuxi, there was a Gu Tiaoquan and his son. They possessed extraordinary strength. While plowing the fields, they disliked the slowness of the oxen, so they carried the oxen back and forth as if holding infants. Standing on the threshold, they braced their waists and had more than ten strong men pull a rope with all their might, but they could not move him. The villagers revered them as the Qin Dou of the martial arts. When the Japanese pirates arrived, they slaughtered the villages, leaving no chickens or dogs alive. The Gu father and son were filled with anger and secretly gathered more than a hundred displaced men. Brandishing their weapons, they charged into the Japanese pirates' formation, their beards and eyebrows stained with blood. The number of Japanese pirates killed was countless. The Japanese chieftain wanted to avenge them and called together elite troops, but repeatedly suffered defeats. The Japanese even regarded Gujia Village as a fearful place. Subsequently, the Japanese pirates dared not approach within twenty miles of Gujia Village. The following year, the Japanese intensified their hatred for the Gu family and gathered more than two thousand troops to besiege the village for ten days, ultimately slaughtering more than a hundred men and women in Gujia Village. The Gu father and son suffered severe injuries but still shouted and glared forward, slaying more than ten Japanese pirates with their own hands. When they were captured, they cursed incessantly. The Japanese chieftain pierced the eyes of Gu and his son with a blade, and they both died on the same day. This is similar to the recent murder of Cai Gengshi. The inhumanity of the Japanese is not something that started today.</p>

<h3>Mr. Gandhi Flatters the French (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Mr. Gandhi, upon returning to India, passed through France and said to the French people:</p>
<p>"I came to England this time empty-handed, gaining nothing! Your country's proverbs of liberty, equality, and fraternity are spoken and practiced, which I greatly admire..."</p>
<p>Such words would not be surprising from the mouth of an ordinary politician, but coming from Mr. Gandhi's mouth, they are somewhat disappointing.</p>
<p>When Mr. Gandhi said these words, did he ever put himself in the place of the sixty million people oppressed by France in the world?</p>
<p>France is currently the second-largest colonial empire in the world, owning thirty colonies with a total area of twelve million square miles and a total population of one hundred million people. From 1880 to 1890, France acquired 60,000 square miles in Asia and one million square miles in Africa. From 1890 to 1900, it acquired 30,000 square miles in Asia and 300,000 square miles in Africa. From 1900 to 1920, it acquired over 1.3 million square miles in Africa. This colonial tiger's mouth is still wide open, waiting to eat.</p>
<p>Imperialist France does not hesitate to use violence to seize colonies. To acquire Algeria, it fought with Arab chieftains for thirty years. After the victory, the French occupied the extremely fertile farmland, vineyards, and olive groves along the coast, driving the natives to remote and barren lands.</p>
<p>The story of France's occupation of Equatorial Africa is even more tragic. It distributed half of the territory to forty companies and prohibited the natives from selling rubber while forcing them to pay a fixed tax in goods to the companies. If the natives resisted, they were massacred. If they submitted to work, they were whipped like cattle and horses, and lazy hands and feet were often cut off. The people in the companies practiced pistols and even used the natives as live targets. It was not until 1919 that the French government issued an order to grant the natives some guarantee of their rights to cultivate land, raise livestock, and hunt.</p>
<h3>Inukai Tsuyoshi's Amorous Words</h3>
<p>— Yizang</p>
<p>Inukai Tsuyoshi, also known as Bokudo, was from Okayama Prefecture. He was naturally eccentric and unrestrained. His family was extremely poor, and they lacked firewood and provisions. Fifty years ago, when he was twenty-seven years old, he had an amorous affair that is worth discussing. In Okayama Prefecture's Kanze Town, there was a brothel called Toyosaki House. Among them was a famous courtesan named Enkichi, who was about twenty years old. Her beautiful appearance was outstanding, and people called her the Flower of Okayama. Those who pursued her were like swarms of bees. One day, Enkichi went out, and Inukai happened to meet her on the road. Seeing her charm and beauty like a fairy, unmatched in the country, he could not help but be mesmerized and quickly approached her, persistently asking for her name and address. The woman truthfully told him. Inukai returned home, remembering her beauty, and became ill with longing. The next day, he went to Toyosaki House. The owner, a man named Hama, saw that his clothes were worn and his heels were torn and refused to let him in. Inukai, in desperation, came up with an idea and said that he was a relative of Enkichi. The owner believed him and led him in. When he saw the woman, they sat together and talked briefly, and their feelings were very harmonious. The woman was also unusually polite, saying, "The reason why I love you is for a lifetime, not just for tonight. If you sincerely love me and wish to entrust me with your love, why must you be so verbose?" Inukai happily accepted. The next morning, when he wanted to leave, he was reluctant to part. He embraced her and comforted her, saying, "Wait for me, and I will find a way to hide you in a golden house." From then on, he would visit her every few days. A fellow villager named Takagi, a wealthy man from Terasaki Town, bribed her father, hoping to marry her. However, the woman's father was quite stubborn and despised his poverty, so the matter did not succeed. Inukai was depressed and unhappy, but he still sought his old flame whenever he had time. When he arrived, he would close the door and drink wildly, indulging in all sorts of intimacies. Before a month had passed, he was heavily in debt. The owner hated him. The wealthy man Takagi criticized him for his extravagance, saying, "I used to think you were talented, but now you are filling the brothel with gold and silver for a woman. I am very disappointed." At this point, Inukai regretted his actions and sought out Takagi, asking for a final two hundred gold pieces to pay off his debts. From then on, he disappeared from the brothel. Later, Enkichi fell ill with longing and died suddenly. When Inukai heard of it, he was distraught with grief. Now Inukai is seventy-seven years old. When people ask him about Enkichi, he always says, "I have wronged this person." This account was recounted by Hama, the former owner of Toyosaki House, who now lives in Arakawaya in Takasago Town, and was published in the Osaka Asahi Shimbun.</p>
<h3>World Small Events Record</h3>
<p>"The Strange Man and Beast Spectacle of the Near World" The novel "Trader Horn" has long been circulated in Europe and America. Since Hollywood produced it into a movie, it has become even more famous in the world. However, no one knows what kind of person the author is. He lives in the center of Surrey, England. People within a few miles around all call him "Paper Jack" and do not know his real name. He has a long beard that hangs down his chest. His hair is also long and hangs on his two shoulders. His clothes are made of brown paper. A rope is tied around his sturdy body. Regardless of cold or heat, cloudy or sunny, he always lives outdoors. The house he lives in is just a small wooden hut. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He only eats some brown bread every day. He once said to someone, "I am probably fifty-eight years old this year. I have forgotten the year and month. I don't know if it's true or not. For ten years, I have never slept in a bed, and I have never had any letters or bills. I have never looked at a clock, and most of the night I sleep under the stars." According to those who know his background, he was originally the son of a wealthy merchant in London. He studied business and mathematics. He obtained a surveyor's degree. He even designed a railway. Unexpectedly, in his youth, he suffered from rheumatism. It suddenly recurred, causing him to become hemiplegic. The doctor could not find a way to treat him. He had long been bored with life. In desperation, he decided to approach nature himself and use the sun and air to treat him. Sure enough, he got amazing results. He is now as strong as an ox and very healthy.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Enduring the Cold</h3>
<p>— Songlu</p>
<p>The weather is cold and freezing, and the coldness is逼人. Those of us who bury our heads in piles of words, sitting in a small room, feel especially bored. When we蘸墨, the inkstone freezes. When we grip the brush, our skin stiffens and is about to crack. Only when we have something to say do we feel like spitting it out quickly. Therefore, enduring the cold, I write this rambling account. A guest who practices the art of King Wen jokingly talked about today's current affairs, saying, "After the revolutionary army settled the Central Plains, they moved the capital to Nanjing, calling the highest administrative organ the Central Government. The Central Government belongs to earth. And the three islands of Japan are located on the shores of the East Sea, and the people of the country call it the East Ocean. The East belongs to wood. In the five elements, wood can overcome earth, so the Central Government in the League of Nations is always thwarted by Tokyo." Silently observing his words, they are quite interesting to ponder. He also said, "The representative of China attending the League of Nations is Shi Zhaoji. Ji below belongs to earth. The representative of Japan attending the League of Nations is Yoshizawa. The head of Yoshizawa belongs to grass, which is also wood. Therefore, according to the theory of wood overcoming earth, it is also very coincidental. How clever it is!"</p>
<p>Little White Dragon is just a bandit. At first, he had no famous name. Since the Xinmin-Hwanggutun incident, he swindled Japanese military salaries and equipment. After fighting with Japan, the newspapers promoted him, praising him as a chivalrous bandit. Speakers even compared him to Long and Ma. Long refers to Little White Dragon, and Ma refers to General Ma Zhanshan, who resisted Japan with his solitary army. As the saying goes, "One thought can spread fragrance for a hundred generations, one thought can leave a bad name for ten thousand years." In legends, there are often descendants of famous officials who become bandits and are eventually recruited to work diligently for the country. People like Little White Dragon have probably been deeply influenced by old novels and were motivated to become what they are.</p>
<p>The night before last, I visited my literary friend, the host of Xuzhai. The host brought out his family genealogy, which contained his ancestor Guo Taiding, a man from the late Ming Dynasty. At that time, Japanese pirates came to invade, and the official army征之 but could not overcome them. The power of the pirates became stronger. Taiding was naturally strong and powerful, fierce and good at fighting. So he recruited dozens of brave soldiers and陷賊陣. Taiding single-handedly advanced,斩贼十餘人,砍其首悬之马后. 累累若穿珠然. 少</p>
<h3>Mr. Gao Junshan Returns from Europe and America to Talk About the National Crisis (5)</h3>
<p>— Jiping</p>
<p>Our country is so weak. Diplomacy cannot achieve victory, and military force is not enough to resist insults. Have we reached a dead end? Is there no way to remedy this? I think that in the current situation, there are at least two things that we should immediately strive to carry out. These are international propaganda and boycotting Japanese goods. Every time a dispute occurs between China and Japan, Japan is able to gain international sympathy because they have sufficient, powerful, and permanent propaganda work. The Japanese government spends a large sum of money every year specifically on this work. Regarding the issue of Manchuria and Mongolia, there are always Japanese articles in American books, newspapers, and magazines discussing how Japan needs Manchuria and Mongolia and how all undertakings will develop after Manchuria and Mongolia are under Japanese management. These kinds of arguments can be seen in the books and newspapers of various countries. Therefore, their invasion of the Northeast this time was not a sudden event. It was a decision made long ago, preparations were made long ago, and air was disseminated in various countries long ago. Only we Chinese people are sleeping like drunkards in a drum. When troops were sent to the three eastern provinces this time, at first, public opinion in various countries was willing to uphold justice. Later, they gradually leaned towards Japan's unilateral side, especially the newspapers of France and the United States. Read the New York Times since October 18th, and you will understand. Not only is the general press like this, but even Dr. Monroe, who is known for being friendly to China, said twice while teaching at Columbia University, "This time the dispute is China's fault towards Japan because China did not abide by the treaty." (According to a letter from a classmate at Columbia University.) Think about it. How powerful is Japan's propaganda effort? It can even cover the eyes and ears of the people of the world. According to the current affairs newspaper of December 20th, "Students of the Osaka Foreign Language School organized a Manchuria-Mongolia Research Class. They first compiled a booklet entitled "The Nature of the Manchuria-Mongolia Incident and Japan's Position," translated it into foreign languages, and sent it to newspaper and magazine companies in thirteen countries around the world. They also translated the national patriotic movement regarding the Dongsan Province incident and sent it to various countries around the world to engage in propaganda." Let us see how Japan has already won everywhere and is still unwilling to relax in doing international propaganda work. How terrible is this?</p>
<p>Looking back at our country, everything is inferior to others. We are bullied to such an extent, yet we dare not utter a word. We have already suffered losses in fact, and we cannot even get international sympathy. I heard that Japan compiled a list of 500 Chinese anti-Japanese actions - of course, most of them are fabricated - and presented it to the League of Nations. Japan's atrocities against China are so cruel, and the number must be more than 500. The Shanghai Third District Party Department published "Japan's Conspiracy and Atrocities against China." It is said that as of the end of 1919, there were already 433 cases. If we carefully examine the external archives, we don't know how many are still missing. We have so many facts. Why are we silent and let people make wild claims? If you don't know how to cry out in pain after being beaten, it's not a pity to be beaten to death.</p>
<p>At that time, the number of pirates increased. Taiding rushed back on horseback. The pirates led the crowd to attack again. Taiding was about to cross the river on horseback. Unexpectedly, the horse was exhausted from carrying the weight and fell into the river, where it was captured by the pirates and beheaded. Later generations recorded his achievements and built the Taiding Bridge for him, enshrining his statue together with Zhang Xun.</p>
<h3>Expedition</h3>
<p>— A Member of the Youth Aid Horse Regiment</p>
<p>(5) Leaving Kunshan</p>
<p>Suzhou has always been known throughout the country for the beauty of its women. In addition, Tiger Hill is also a top-notch scenic spot. I have long admired this beauty and beautiful scenery. Now that I have finally arrived at my destination, how happy I am!</p>
<p>This afternoon (12th), we bid farewell to the Kunshan masses who saw us off and took the train to Suzhou. The people waiting to welcome us at the station were more than ten times as many as in Kunshan. We were led by the welcoming representatives to the Zhonghua Hotel to rest. The owner of the hotel gave us more than a dozen large rooms and did not charge us rent. His patriotic enthusiasm can be regarded as a model for capitalists. The meals were provided by Dongwu students. We felt very sorry about this.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 13th, we accepted the kindness of representatives from all walks of life and students and held a welcoming meeting at the public sports field. All the speeches were extremely tragic and painful, moving the listeners. After the meeting, we paraded. Thousands of spectators emptied the streets.</p>
<p>In Suzhou, except for a few prosperous streets, the other roads are very narrow. The houses are not very tall. The language uses a lot of local accents. You can hear the warm and soft Suzhou dialect everywhere. We people from other provinces came here for the first time, and our eardrums were refreshed.</p>
<p>Last night in Kunshan, a strong north wind suddenly blew. It hasn't stopped yet. It almost blew off our ears. It's really terrible! But we feel happy instead, because this strong wind may have blown from Heilongjiang for us to experience.</p>

<h3>Sharing the Same Hatred (19)</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Blood-Soaked Battlefield</p>
<p>After Peng Meiguo's army was dispatched, a train of Sun Army suddenly arrived in T City. Ostensibly to protect overseas Chinese and guard the railway, they actually occupied T City. The people of T City suffered greatly from the Sun Army's poison. The Sun Army's commander, Jin Gui Shisaburo, was arrogant and self-satisfied, waiting for good news from the front. Unexpectedly, news came that Peng Meiguo had been killed by his daughter and a patriotic university student surnamed Hua. Now the army has returned to the command of the man surnamed Hua and has re-erected the Blue Sky White Sun flag to recapture T City. The dozen or so military officers sent to command there, half of them have been captured and killed, and the rest have escaped back to report the news. The residents of T City were secretly happy when they heard it. But Jin Gui Shisaburo was furious and immediately led two Sun Army regiments, as well as cavalry and artillery, to the front to block and kill. It turned out that Hua Naqiang had executed Peng Meiguo. It was not until the next morning that it was announced. Mei Guo's body was prepared for burial by Zhongshu. Hua Naqiang immediately convened the armies to speak. The army was shocked when they first heard the news. But later, knowing that Zhongshu had selflessly destroyed relatives and was enthusiastic about loving the country, and that Hua Naqiang had given them a generous and impassioned speech, everyone was somewhat moved. So no one objected. Hua Naqiang also made it clear that those who were willing to follow him to kill the bandits would stay here, and the rest would be free to leave. As a result, one-third of them dispersed, and the remaining ones were all elite soldiers. Everyone was stirred by patriotism and elected Hua Naqiang as commander, obeying unanimously. Hua Naqiang had already killed several Sun Army officers, and the rest had fled. Hua Naqiang estimated that the Sun Army would not give up after receiving this news, and learned that T City had been occupied by the Sun Army. So he ordered his troops to return to attack T City. Unexpectedly, they encountered the Sun Army halfway. Hua Naqiang then asked Zhongshu to lead an army to engage the Sun Army head-on. When the battle reached one or two o'clock, they could slowly retreat and lure the Sun Army to pursue. He also asked the artillery battalion commander, Ren Yuan, to supervise the artillery and set up heavy artillery in the woods on Yejigang in the rear. When the Sun Army pursuers arrived, they would open fire to attack. He also ordered a battalion of infantry to scatter in the mountains and forests near the railway, waiting for the artillery fire on Yejigang to sound, and then lie in ambush in the mountains and forests to fire, but not to attack, as a feint. He himself led a battalion of cavalry,抄過去 from the intervening road, waiting to intercept and kill when the enemy was defeated. The armies were divided and assigned. The Sun Army cavalry arrived first. They were attacking in three routes: the left-wing cavalry, the right-wing infantry, and the middle route was along the railway, using armored vehicles as assault weapons. Behind them was a field artillery team to cover. Seeing that the enemy cavalry had arrived, Zhongshu ordered them to open fire. But the enemy cavalry was very elite, approaching like a storm. So this side used machine guns to sweep. They only heard a loud bang from the enemy's side. A large cannonball landed near Zhongshu,炸死了 several strong men. Zhongshu was not afraid at all and continued to command the army to fight. After the cannon fired, the armored vehicles had charged forward. The right-wing infantry had also夹攻 from the side. The sound of gunfire was incessant, like firecrackers.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Market's Sharp Momentum</h3>
<p>▲ High Increase of 11 Taels and Some Change: Yesterday, the price of gold surged unexpectedly, following the trend of Meng Pu, with excellent momentum. The difference between the highest and lowest prices of the day was 21 taels. After overall calculations, it rose by 11 taels and some change. However, due to the rise in the silver market the day before, the opening price was low, immediately breaking through 660 taels. Subsequently, various individuals and firms vigorously bought in, and it was rumored that Mr. Wu also purchased, causing the short sellers to cover their positions even more. Furthermore, both the contract amounts and cash were felt to be lacking, leading to a rise in forward contracts, reaching as high as 25 taels. It was heard that the bullish Yufeng and Yongzeng made transactions, greatly stimulating the short sellers. As a result, the market sentiment felt particularly sharp. It leaped out of the 670 tael level, and by noon, it had surged by more than 20 taels. It was likely that foreign exchange also became tense, and hedging had already started to come in. Within only 30 taels, the industry was likely settling up to counter the short positions and selling gold for hedging. Later in the day, the situation seemed to stabilize slightly, but without much trading volume, the price fluctuations were minimal.</p>
<p>▲ Rise Begins After Low Opening: The price fell 4 taels and 8 mace to 657 taels immediately after the opening in the morning. Next it fell to 6 taels and a half. Large bars of silver rose by 1/16 yesterday, and forward contracts rose by 1/4. Silver prices also increased by 1/4. Moreover, due to the severe situation in Jinzhou, people's confidence dropped. Unexpectedly, major players took advantage of this opportunity to buy, such as Zhifeng, Yongnei, Xing, and others including Richang, Tianfeng, Yongda, Xingyong, and certain banks. They competed to buy, causing the price to immediately rise by 10 taels to 666 taels and a half. Foreign exchange also appeared strong. East Asia and Wah Bi offered US dollars for April delivery at $34.125. Wah Bi and Youli mutually traded spot British gold at 2 shillings and 0.025. Mitsui absorbed at 3.125. Later, Shunli, Yuanmao, Yong, and others sold, returning to a small 2 or 3 taels. British gold opened at 64 taels, but the listed price did not change. US dollars increased by 0.375, which was to squeeze foreign exchange dealers. The price of gold then slightly fell to 63 taels. HSBC bought spot US dollars at $4.50. Afterwards, Yongfeng, Daxingyong, Hengxing, Yuanhengchang, Yongwupin, Yifengyong, Hongkangyong, and Wu Lu all competed to buy, especially in forward contracts, where the prices were raised even higher, reaching 25 taels. Short sellers were under intense pressure from the bulls, and there was much settling of US dollars, with the price gradually rising to $34. As a result, the price of gold broke through 70 taels. At 10:30 AM, it was at 74 taels and 2 mace. At this time, Qianchangxiang, Yu Da, Yongfeng, Dadecheng, and hedgers came to sell, causing a sharp drop of over 3 taels, to 70 taels and a half. Afterwards, there were slight fluctuations. After 11:00 AM, buying interest increased, while US dollars only settled at $3.875, and British gold for March and April delivery was within 2 shillings. Therefore, at 11:30 AM, it reached 77 taels and 5 mace. Suddenly, there seemed to be more sellers, and it fell back to 74 taels and 5 mace. Dadecheng, Shunli, and others bought slightly, bringing it back to 77 taels. It closed at 75 taels and 2 mace at noon, with the posted price changed to 716 taels and a half, a difference of 50 to 40 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Weak Trading and Flat Fluctuations: The afternoon market opened at 74 taels and a half, followed by 5 taels and a half. It was heard that Bombay reported a small 3 annas. Afterwards, Yifeng and others sold, and as the US dollar rebounded, Wah Bi initially absorbed $4 for March delivery, then $4.0625 for January delivery could be settled. Bombay did not change. It had already fallen by more than 5 taels. At 3:00 PM, it was at 70 taels. In an instant, retail customers came to buy on the exchange floor, reaching 73 taels and 8 mace at 3:30 PM. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of 2 taels in either direction. After 3:45 PM, HSBC sold US dollars for February delivery at $4.0625, and general retail bulls profitably sold, reducing it by 2 taels, reaching 71 taels and 2 mace at 4:20 PM. Foreign exchange trading was quiet, not as lively as the morning session. However, near the closing, Hengxing suddenly came to buy, so the market closed at 73 taels at 4:30 PM. It continued trading to 74 taels, and Bombay also narrowed by 3 annas. However, there were no large transactions on the exchange floor. Compared to last Saturday (according to the posted price), it increased by 11 taels and 2 mace. The largest price for the day was 77 taels and a half, and the lowest price was 56 taels and a half, a difference of 21 taels. Looking back, spot goods were at 58 taels in the morning, closing at 76 taels at noon, 75 taels in the afternoon, and closing at 73 taels. The posted price showed a difference of 43 or 44 taels. The recorded prices were 82 taels for December, 85 taels for January, 75 taels for January, 82 taels for make-up water, and 80 taels in the afternoon. Because Yufeng, Yong, and others bought, the price of raw silver increased by as much as 16 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Lack of Clear Guidelines for Trading: According to the exchange floor transaction statistics, Daxingyong, Neixing, Hongkangyong, Futaiheng, Dadecheng, Hengchangyong, Hengxingyuan, Fuyu, and certain banks and speculative merchants like Wu Lu all bought. Zhifengyong, Yuantai, Dakang, Cuichangyong, Hengyu, Yifengyong, and Qianchangxiang had mixed buying and selling. Shunli, Yongfeng, Yu Da, Yuanmao, Yong, Hengxing, Yifeng, and foreign firms like Qiao Rifu all sold. In the afternoon, Hengxing, Shunli, and Yuanmao Yong all bought. Bingxing, Shunmao, and Yifeng all sold. The situations of the other firms were quite complex. The Ningbo group bought over 800 contracts and sold 600 or 700 contracts. The Guangdong group sold over 800 contracts and bought 300 or 400 contracts.</p>
<h3>Active Black Market for Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>▲ Banks Buy Spot, Sell Forward</p>
<p>▲ Hedging Gradually Tightens</p>
<p>The exchange rates for British and American silver rose the day before. All the exchange rates rose, and HSBC's listed price for British gold did not change, but US dollars increased by 0.375, totaling $33.5. Hong Kong increased by 0.125, totaling 75.625 taels. The exchange rates for India, Germany, and France had also been raised, while the exchange rate for Singapore remained the same. The trend in the banks' internal trading was tight, which was due to the fact that the gold market had broken through 670 taels, so it also led to tightening. The overall market slightly hovered. It appeared to return to equilibrium in the afternoon. As a result, compared to last Saturday, British gold narrowed by 0.1875, and US dollars also narrowed by 0.1875. The near-term was still loose, while the long-term was tight. Hedging appeared to tighten, with 22 or 23 taels in the morning and 30 taels in the afternoon, causing the gold merchants to settle and occasionally take short positions. HSBC and other banks absorbed spot and sold forward. Because foreign firms had to settle payments, about 100,000 pounds of British gold and 600,000 or 700,000 US dollars were traded. The market sentiment was firm and profitable.</p>

<h3>Interest and Discount Rates Trend Upward Again</h3>
<p>▲ Rapid Changes in Subsidiary Coinage</p>
<p>▲ General Market Conditions: Because interest rates were too low the day before, banks slightly raised them yesterday, resulting in an increase of about 0.02. However, there was not much progress in sales. As the end of the year approached, silver discounts were about to be finalized, and many traders lacked capital and had to compete. Therefore, it was inevitable that both sides would engage in disputes, leading to higher auxiliary currencies, which was a common practice at the end of the year. There was a sharp change, and it had been rising steadily for days, with a strong increase of 0.5 in three days. It was feared that the Guangdong subsidiary coinage would soon exceed 0.06, while copper coins would shrink to the 70,000-cash level.</p>
<p>▲ Interest and Discount Rates (Silver Interest): The early market interest rates were quite good due to the banks' increase. At the close, it rose by 0.01 compared to the day before, calculated as 7 mace, 2 fen, 2 li, and 7 hao and a half. The afternoon market continued to increase by 0.875, to 7 mace, 2 fen, 3 li, and 6 hao, and 2 hu and a half. The two markets together increased by a little less than 0.02, and the situation greatly improved. (Silver Discounts) Both the morning and afternoon markets were 0.038, with an additional 0.02 for the head. Banks listed at 0.015. Because discount ticket trading had been sluggish recently, the fluctuations in silver discounts were not noticed much. Therefore, upon encountering an alert, it could be raised immediately. As for whether it could rebound, it would depend on the stability of the overall market situation.</p>
<p>▲ Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: The subsidiary coins of Jiangnan rose with the Guangdong coins. The early market was at 0.0648, and the afternoon market suddenly reached 0.065, which was 0.003 higher than the early market the day before. The trading volume was 6,000 coins in the early market and 9,000 coins in the afternoon market. The Guangdong subsidiary coins were at 0.0658 in the early market and 0.06585 in the afternoon market, which was 0.0045 higher than the early market the day before. The trading volume was 185,000 coins in the early market and 70,000 coins in the afternoon market. Copper coins decreased by 2,000 wen, to 371,000 wen, and had also been decreasing by 5,000 or 6,000 wen over several days.</p>
<p>▲ Silver and Foreign Currency Transactions (Silver): Yesterday was Monday, and it was also approaching the end of the year, so there were many settlements and transactions. Chinese merchants settled and collected 3,340,000 in notes, foreign merchants settled and collected 2,780,000 in notes, and various goods, exchange, tax, and miscellaneous payments collected 7,340,000. Special payments collected over 2,000,000, settlements collected over 5,000,000, deposits were 1,400,000, and money shops and silver firms collected over 39,000,000 in notes. Additional payments collected over 310,000, various remittances collected over 700,000, and cash settlements were over 1,000,000. (Foreign Currency) Remittance notes transacted 1,770,000 in the morning market and 955,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes transacted 125,000 in the morning market and 65,000 in the afternoon market. Off-exchange banknotes transacted 190,000 in the morning market and 108,000 in the afternoon market. Banks traded 700,000 in the interbank market in the morning and 400,000 in the interbank market in the afternoon. Transactions between various banks and foreign accounts collected over 1,600,000, banknotes transacted 1,340,000, money shops and foreign firms collected over 4,900,000, additional payments collected over 1,300,000, foreign currency lending transacted over 1,700,000, small money shops traded 400,000 or 500,000, and the volume of transactions with out-of-town merchants remained quiet.</p>
<h3>Bond Market After the Lifting of Price Limits</h3>
<p>The morning market was weak with a sharp decline.</p>
<p>The afternoon market was slightly better with a trend towards stability.</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 20th), at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, although various bonds were offered in the spot market, there were not many transactions. In the futures market, transactions were more active after the price limits were lifted. The market was lively with buying and selling interest. As for the trend of market prices of various bonds, the tense situation with Japan and the fear that war in the Jinzhou area would be unavoidable made the future even more serious. The exchange had previously set minimum price limits, but felt that they were inconvenient, so they consulted with the Ministry of Finance and agreed to lift them starting yesterday. Although the financial industry and various parties remained calm as before and did not sell off large amounts, the public sentiment was weak, and general retail customers urgently sought to sell, while demand was still very thin. The early market opened with a sharp decline. The December salt tax bonds immediately fell to the price limit and trading was suspended. The December consolidated tax bonds also fell to the price limit and trading was suspended in the second round. However, in the second round, the trend gradually turned peaceful. In the afternoon session, people's confidence slightly stabilized, and the prices of various bonds were slightly firmer than the morning session. In the end, compared to the previous weekend, they still fell by about 2 or 3 yuan, with only the 1926 bonds falling by about 0.5 yuan. Looking at the situation of the bond market, it continues to be extremely chaotic. If the situation turns around slightly, it will not be difficult for them to rebound immediately. The total spot trading volume was 23,000 yuan. The futures trading volume was 4,080,000 in the morning session and 2,560,000 in the afternoon session, totaling 6,640,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn, Cotton, and Yarn Market Steady</h3>
<p>The yarn market was calm. Because the country was in turmoil and Japanese disturbances were intensifying, the financial situation was tense and people were disheartened. Retail bulls tended to sell off, but the spot inventory in the market was not thick, and the bulls held onto near-month contracts, so the situation was in a dilemma.</p>
<p>▲ Distant Months Were Bidding Well at 5 or 6 Mace: The morning market opened with American cotton being flat. The number of buyers in the market was not strong, and the prices for each month rose by 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.05. The afternoon market was flat, with prices for each month rising by 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04. The total trading volume for the day was 11,150 bales. It was found that Mingde sold 650 bales, Shenji 500 bales, and Yichang 2,100 bales. Yiyu bought 1,100 bales, Gengfeng 600 bales, Hengyi 1,900 bales, and Gongtai 550 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Closing Prices for Personal Bids Increase/Decrease Account Balance</p>
<p>December 152.9 Decreased by 0.125 850 March 153 Increased by 566,350</p>
<p>January 152.8 Increased by 0.07 54,100 April 153.8 0.05 52,500</p>
<p>February 152.8 0.05 64,150 May 153.9 0.06 32,850</p>
<p>▲ 1,100 Bales of Yarn Sold: Spot yarn sales were still good. According to the statistics for the entire day, various groups bought 900 bales, and 210 bales were traded within the industry. The market conditions were flat. Among the out-of-town merchants, Yunnan bought 80 bales, Shantou 50 bales, Sichuan 200 bales, Jiangxi 55 bales, Guangdong 185 bales, inland China 205 bales, and miscellaneous groups 35 bales.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>The cotton market was slightly firm. Because the price of gold rose slightly and Indian cotton trended upward, people's confidence stabilized and the bulls' pulling force was particularly strong. However, American cotton was flat, and the actual needs of the factories were blocked and credit was extremely tight. Spot flower sales were increasingly clear. However, general outside operators and bulls from the Hankou and Ningbo groups had a stronger desire to go long because their base was too dry.</p>
<p>▲ Hankou Bids Rose Slightly by 0.01 or 0.02: The morning market for Hankou bids opened with Indian cotton rising, and prices for each month rose by 0.01 or 0.02. The afternoon market was flat, with prices for each month falling by 0.005. The total trading volume for the day was 50,500 dan. It was found that Yichang sold 3,000 dan, Meiji 1,000 dan, Yuda 2,100 dan, and Changhe 1,000 dan. Xincheng bought 3,500 dan, Yichang 3,800 dan, Yifeng 1,200 dan, Hengyi 2,900 dan, Hengda 1,000 dan, and Gongtai 3,400 dan. The closing prices are listed below. Closing Prices for Hankou Bids Increase/Decrease Account Balance</p>
<p>December 31.0 Increased by 0.15 79,000 March 52.1 Increased by 0.10 184,900</p>

<p>February 31.95 0.15 185,800 May 52.40 0.15 90,700</p>
<p>▲ Factory Demand Shows No Signs of Recovery: Spot cotton trading was extremely quiet. After absorbing enough foreign cotton, all the factories had no remaining appetite.</p>
<h3>Indian and British Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>▲ Bombay: The market situation was very firm last week due to the lack of arrivals. Although the price of gold fell, merchants still dared not sell at this high price because the cotton harvest had been severely damaged. The firmness and high price of Oomra was entirely due to insufficient supply. Japanese manufacturers were buying large quantities of American cotton to replace the high-priced Indian cotton. China was taking profits on previous forward positions. In terms of spot goods, the demand for new cotton continued to be active. Local manufacturers only bought some to meet urgent needs. The statistics for the past week are attached below (unit: 1,000 bales).</p>
<p>1930 1931</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts Since September 1 590 258</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory 5.8 358</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports Since September 1 594 322</p>
<p>Shipped to Europe 144 61</p>
<p>Shipped to China 107 98</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan 537 146</p>
<p>Other Regions 6 17</p>
<p>▲ Liverpool: Spot sales were brisk last week. Futures were fluctuating due to Japan's abandonment of the gold standard and fears of labor unrest in Lancashire. However, due to the hope of increased tariffs on foreign piece goods, there was a slight boost. All goods fell due to the price of gold, but raw cotton was able to maintain its price due to hoarding in the southern United States. The Egyptian cotton market was dull and lacked features.</p>
<h3>Grain and Lower River Rice Market Gradually Declining</h3>
<p>▲ Nantou: Yesterday, there were about 30 sources from various groups. Sales on this street were sluggish. Changshu, Xixin, and Sutong groups gradually declined. High-quality soft rice was down 0.2 and then 0.3. The decline calmed down in the morning and evening. The opening prices were 0.3 or 0.4 lower. The quality of Yangdu tip rice was limited, with no rise or fall. The sales of Bianyin rice at 2 yuan were still good, and the trend was difficult to loosen. Sales of Kejian rice were flat. The sources of Wanning rice were withering, and the goods were limited. The market conditions were stable.</p>
<p>▲ Xinzha: Yesterday, there was still no turnaround. There were few people coming to the market in the morning, but the appetite was even duller. The opening prices gradually declined. The road to the top was constantly broken. However, it was the end of the lunar year, and both sides of the firms were settling accounts, and the river inventory was still thick. Credit was extremely tight, and the customers were cutting prices. Xixin and Early Bo rice were each down 0.2 or 0.3. Yangdu tip rice was not selling well, and the situation continued to fall. However, the Tongbian distillery had a very good appetite, and the situation called for a rise of nearly 0.1.</p>
<h3>Spot Small Pressed Rice Price Increases Significantly</h3>
<p>▲ Hankou Group Continues to Handle Over 3,000 Bales</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for foreign rice turned better. Because the digestion of spot goods became more active, the Hankou group handled 3,000 bales through Xingchang Zhuduban, and over 2,000 bales were also traded on this street. As a result, the price suddenly increased significantly. This street bought small pressed rice, and also brought in 500 bales of Taizhou rice that had newly arrived. The market situation also improved. The opening price for small pressed rice was 9.3 to 9 yuan, and the price for Taizhou rice was 11.25 yuan. There were return cargoes of期米 small pressed rice in May for 200 tons, priced at 4 taels, 7 mace, and 3 fen to 4 taels, 7 mace. In the new transactions, Shunquan Jiang sold 1,000 tons of February small pressed rice, priced at 4 taels and 2 mace. It was also said that foreign firms such as Chanson had telegrams arriving at the same price, but they had not yet been traded.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Turns Upward</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed an initial flat trend followed by an upward turn. In the first few rounds in the morning, because the foreign wheat quote was slightly smaller by 0.02, people's confidence was weak. Then, because the factories were watching and part of the inland groups had some interest in buying, and short sellers were also quite active, the market sentiment showed a good side. When the afternoon market opened, the recent period was said to be very active in Hua Feng's short covering, while the distant period was gradually absorbed by the southern groups, so the market sentiment turned upward immediately. Each month rose by about 0.02. Observing the subsequent steps, it may still turn into a good trend. As a result, this month rose by 0.02 compared to the day before, January and February were good by 0.0225, March and April rose by 0.0175, and May rose by 0.02.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Calm</h3>
<p>▲ Afternoon Slightly Rose with the Flour Price</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the morning market opened, was flat and tired due to the small foreign wheat quote. There were also few transactions in the near and far terms. Because the collection was about to end, the inland groups rarely traded in and out, so the market sentiment was unusually calm. When the afternoon market opened, there were still few transactions, but because the flour market turned upward, the opening prices for the near and far terms also slightly rose. However, with constant inquiries about foreign wheat, buyers still could not avoid being cautious. As a result, this month was better by 0.01 compared to the previous week, February was unchanged, January and April were better by 0.04, and May and June were not opened.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Rise by 0.01</h3>
<p>▲ Ice Flower Green Opens Quite Well</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market lacked dispatches from the producing areas. The buying interest was very strong in the market of the trade association, so the market price rose. Over 1,000 bags of Dutch sugar No. 24 raw sugar and white sugar were traded, with prices at 1.97 yuan. Imports and exports were both slow. Mianhe white rose to 11.35 yuan, and supply was lacking. Dutch red No. 8 was at 8.35 yuan, and No. 9 goods were at 8.55 yuan. The market situation was also very good. Over 2,000 bags of Taikoo Sugar spot were offered, and B mark at 7.6 yuan was also sold. Because it was a trade association transaction, it felt rather sparse. B mark was at 11.75 yuan, HX mark was at 11.55 yuan, and HM mark was at 11.45 yuan. The receivers were quiet, and the trend was still firm. Huaxin had the number plate to offer 550 bags of spot Dutch red at 8.55 yuan, and the domestic Huanggang green was offered at several hundred bags, with the price at 8.3 yuan, and high at 8.4 yuan. The opening price for first-grade ice flower goods was 9.8 yuan, and the market situation was quite good.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Dried Black Fungus Market Slightly Improves</h3>
<p>Dried black fungus has repeatedly declined due to sluggish sales. In terms of the market situation in recent years, it has been at a low price. The sales price for higher-quality dried black fungus once fell to 70 taels within the customs, and it had fallen by nearly one-third compared to the highest price. The degree of decline was very evident. Currently, sales from Fujian and Guangdong are slightly more active, but they are still not brisk. Therefore, although the sales price has slightly risen, it is still difficult to be very good. Yesterday, the market price for top-grade was 130 taels, high-quality was 73-74 taels, ordinary grade was 70 taels, and the price for lower-quality was slightly lower. The market situation was flat.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Telegraphs Do Not Turn</h3>
<p>▲ No Transactions in Either Futures or Spot Silk</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign firm silk market in this port was even more sluggish. Because the overseas silk market continued to be depressed, the silk telegrams sent last week did not reach Shanghai yesterday morning. Various European firms were thinking of buying Chinese silk at a lower price, and the attitude of the silk merchants was passive. There were no transactions in either futures or spot silk yesterday.</p>
<h3>Milanese Italian Silk: European Sales Still Stagnant</h3>
<p>The Milanese Italian silk market remained quiet. Last week, European and American exporters were mostly watching and not taking action on various futures and spot silks, and the prices continued to fall. Double-extra grade was offered at 315 lira per kilo, extra grade was 274 lira, and superior grade was 211 lira.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Increasingly Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign firm tea market in this port was quiet. The green tea from Tunxi, Shexian, and other regions that had been jointly sold was already sold out. The Frankfurt telegrams for the Wuyuan high-grade green tea had not yet been initiated, so the British firms in Shanghai mostly held a wait-and-see attitude. The market only transacted 74 boxes of local Pingshui pearl tea, and the selling prices all fell by 2 or 3 taels.</p>
<h3>Shoe Felt and Woolen Fabric Market Shows Strength</h3>
<p>The market for shoe felt and woolen fabric is currently considered stable, with prices also showing strength. Shoe factories in Shanghai are actively stocking up, and inland merchants from Wuxi and other places are also telegraphing and requesting orders, leading to sales that are more brisk than last month. The most popular colors are mixed colors, as well as grey, peach red, and blue. The once-popular bright gold, apple green, and lake green colors have become a thing of the past. Sellers are willing to lower prices by a tael or two per piece, but few buyers are interested. Yesterday, the price at the 克百賚咪吔泰和 store at number 1000 was 7 taels and 850 cash, 7 taels and 600 cash for number 950, 7 taels and 250 cash for number 700, 7 taels for number 850, and 6 taels and 560 cash for number 800.</p>
<h3>New Iron Wire Prices Fall by Five Cents</h3>
<p>Due to sluggish actual sales, the ironware market has been very quiet in recent days. However, as the end of the year approaches, prices are falling, and there are more downstream buyers. Yesterday, new iron wire, sizes 16 to 20, was selling for only 13 taels and 500 cash per dan (unit of weight), and sizes 21 to 25 were selling for 14 taels and 500 cash, each down five cents from before. However, buyers are still hesitant to purchase in large quantities, so the number of orders remains low. Looking at the overall situation, it is anticipated that standard grades may continue to decline slightly.</p>
<h3>American Galvanized Iron Internal Market Weak</h3>
<p>Since the arrival of British galvanized iron, the market has been in decline. Although various industry players have tried their best to maintain it, the poor environment has led to a downward trend in standard grades. Thin-gauge goods are selling for only 17 taels, down 250 cash from before. Thick-gauge colored goods have also decreased by varying amounts of one or two cents.</p>
<h3>Coal: New Cargo of Liujiang Coal Arrives</h3>
<p>Liujiang white coal has not been delivered for a month, and the coal in stock here has long been sold out. Even stinky Liujiang coal has become a sought-after commodity and has been completely sold. Therefore, the local businesses are eagerly awaiting the arrival of new stock, and prices are trending upwards. It is now known that new stock arrived at the coal yards yesterday, including 2,000 tons of fragrant Liujiang coal and 3,000 tons of stinky Liujiang coal. The news has spread, and merchants are flocking to the Huangpu River to load up their boats. The selling price is 16 taels and 750 cash per ton for fragrant Liujiang coal and 12 taels and 500 cash for stinky Liujiang coal.</p>

Other central committee members staying in Guangdong, such as Xiao Focheng, Deng Zeru, Tang Shaoyi, Chen Jitang, Bai Chongxi, and Liu Jiwen, may not be able to attend the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee due to official duties or planning for national defense and bandit suppression. (Question) How is Mr. Hu Hanmin doing recently? Why didn't he come with the committee members? (Answer) Mr. Hu's illness has worsened recently, his blood pressure is often around 180, and doctors have ordered him to rest. He rarely sees guests in Hong Kong, so he did not come. (Question) What important proposals do the committee members have for the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee? (Answer) The important mission of this First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is to promote the unity of all comrades in the party internally, to unify the revolutionary ranks in the future, and externally to strive to unify the hearts and minds of the people of the country to jointly overcome national difficulties. Therefore, the proposals to be discussed at the plenary session should mainly focus on foreign policy toward Japan and the unification of party and government. There are many resolutions on this matter from the Fourth Plenary Session of the Guangdong Provincial Party Congress. We should uphold the spirit of the Congress' resolutions and advocate them at the plenary session. Other than that, we have not yet decided to propose other motions. (Question) Can we hear about the main resolutions on foreign policy toward Japan from the Fourth Plenary Session of the Guangdong Provincial Party Congress? (Answer) As already announced, cases such as the recovery of lost territory in the Northeast and rescuing Ma Zhanshan have been passed by unanimous vote. As for Zhang Xueliang, who lost territory and disgraced the nation, it was proposed that he must be severely punished. This is necessary to rectify the discipline of the country. After the closing of the Congress, the Guangdong Central Party Headquarters and the National Government immediately implemented the resolutions of the Congress, such as assisting General Ma Zhanshan, and the Central Executive Committee resolved to send Central Committee member Huang Jilu and others to the front lines to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers one week prior. This action by the Central Committee not only expressed fervent sympathy for the anti-Japanese soldiers in Heilongjiang Province, but also aimed to have Mr. Huang conduct a clear investigation of the situation on the front lines after arriving in Heilongjiang Province, preparing to provide comprehensive spiritual and material assistance with all efforts, not just empty words. Although this matter cannot be handled immediately due to the opening of the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, we must still uphold this spirit, hoping that the unified central government after the plenary session can continue to carry out this work. (Question) What are your opinions on the central political reform plan? (Answer) At the Shanghai Peace Conference, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Guangdong Provincial Party Congress unanimously resolved to adopt the reform plan for the central political system. Based on past facts, we believe that the only way forward for our country's politics in the future is to correct the mistakes of the past, where the military held power over the government, and the government held power over the party. Therefore, in the Peace Conference's resolution, it is extremely important to abolish the positions of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force during peacetime, and to ensure that the Chairman of the National Government is a person of high age and virtue, avoiding active military personnel from serving as chairman. In addition, we firmly advocate that during the period of political tutelage, people should gradually be given the opportunity to participate in politics. Only in this way can the foundation of democracy be established to implement constitutional government. Furthermore, judging from the current situation in China, this is also necessary to achieve cooperation between the government and the people and to deal with the current national crisis. (Question) What is the recent situation in Guangdong and Guangxi? (Answer) Since the establishment of the National Government in Guangdong, its most important work has been to promote local autonomy in Guangdong and Guangxi. Local autonomy in rural areas has gradually become effective, and county councils have been established in order. Once the foundation of autonomy at all levels is consolidated, constitutional government will be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Outline of National Construction. Since the revolution, the burden on the people of Guangdong and Guangxi has been heavier than in other provinces, and the people of Guangdong and Guangxi's awareness of the revolution has gradually shifted from the revolutionary work of destruction to the demands of revolutionary construction. The implementation of local autonomy and construction seems easier, which is due to the change in revolutionary consciousness. (Question) When will the committee members go to the capital? (Answer) After we disembark, we must all go to the hospital to comfort Mr. Wang Jingwei's illness. If there are no other matters, we will take the train to Beijing that evening.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Committee Members Arriving in Shanghai Take Photos Ashore (Photo by Wang Kai)</h3>
<p>▲ Li Zongren's Remarks The commander-in-chief of the Fourth Army Group, Li Zongren, made the following remarks to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency: (Reporter asked) When did you leave Guangdong and will you stay in Shanghai temporarily after arriving? (Answer) When I read Mr. Jiang's telegram of resignation on the 16th, I did not hesitate to set off for the capital to jointly overcome national difficulties. Because I was waiting for a ship in Hong Kong, I didn't arrive in Shanghai until this morning. This trip is to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, and I will not stay in Shanghai for long. (Question) What are your reflections on the past and your proposals for the future? (Answer) Since the spring of the 18th year, we have been fighting to overthrow the dictatorship, not solely for the purpose of opposing individuals. In order to seek long-term stability in the future, the party and politics must be democratized. If the party can restore democratic centralism and the country can establish democratic politics, then the evils of individual dictatorship will have no way to arise. (Question) What is the situation in Guangxi in recent years? (Answer) In Guangxi, due to difficult circumstances and a lack of financial resources, political construction has not been fully advanced in recent years. We have only been working diligently to avoid mistakes. We firmly believe that to secure the party and the country, we must cultivate democratic forces, and local autonomy is the key stage to achieve this goal. We have now started in important counties and cities to establish models and then promote them throughout the province within a set time limit. In order to strengthen the people's self-defense forces and ensure local autonomy, we have also thoroughly trained the people's militia throughout the province, and there are visible results. (Question) The invasion by the violent Japanese is already a sign of destruction, and those who have the responsibility to defend the territory are adopting a policy of non-resistance. What are your thoughts on this? (Answer) This time, Japan attacked the Eastern Provinces without declaring war, violating international conventions, which is not allowed by justice and humanity. However, the military commander who bears the important responsibility of border defense, with an army of more than 200,000, advocated a policy of non-resistance and retreated, causing the Liaoning and Jilin provinces to fall in an instant. The Ning government has not taken any action of sanction against this, which is truly heartbreaking. Now that things have come to this, we can only concentrate the strength of the whole country, unite to avenge the national shame and save the country, and recover the lost territory in the Northeast as soon as possible. Even if we suffer heavy sacrifices, we can still maintain considerable glory for our country and nation. (Question) When will Commander Zhang Fakui's army, which has requested to aid Heilongjiang, be able to move out? (Answer) I deeply sympathize with Commander Zhang's brave action to aid Heilongjiang. We are now actively preparing, and the unified government will have the final decision on this. All our soldiers are united in hatred against the enemy and determined to be the first to advance. If there is a central order, we will send out our troops to resist the enemy together. (Question) Now that foreign troubles are urgent, and the communist disaster within the country is also very serious, what are your opinions on this? (Answer) Now that the communist bandits are so rampant, we should engage in pacification with great determination and effort. As for the methods of treating the symptoms, it is appropriate to use military suppression. Furthermore, the central government must select generals and soldiers and provide them with a complete plan and full preparation to suppress step by step and achieve success within a set time limit. First, the bandit forces must be annihilated, and at the same time, we must begin to use the fundamental political method of bandit suppression, rapidly promoting local autonomy and establishing the people's armed forces. What is especially important is to strengthen our party and deeply unite with the people, mobilizing in unison from the political, economic, and cultural aspects to realize the construction of our party's ideology. In this way, the communist bandits can be permanently eradicated. However, this task is extremely difficult and important. (Question) It is said that Annam has plans that are unfavorable to the border between Yunnan and Guangxi. Is this true? (Answer) I have repeatedly received reports from Longzhou that Annam is conscripting reservists, building airports, and stockpiling military supplies near Liangshan, extending roads. The purpose is still unclear. However, Guangxi has paid close attention to border defense. If there is foreign invasion, we will take proper precautions. I believe that we should eliminate civil war and focus on national defense, so as to resist aggression and save the country. I hope that all the people of the country will rise up together to promote its realization.</p>
<p>▲ Visiting and Comforting Wang In the afternoon at approximately 2:00 PM, Li Zongren and Ma Chaojun, representing all the Guangdong Committee members who came to Shanghai, went to the Del Hospital on Avenue Joffre to comfort Wang Jingwei and urge him to go to the capital as soon as possible to jointly manage national affairs. Wang said that his illness was too much to bear, and he expressed that he could not go to the capital temporarily in practice.</p>
<p>▲ Cangzhou Meeting Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, all the Guangdong Committee members who came to Shanghai gathered at the Cangzhou Hotel to discuss various important matters and to sort out proposals for the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, and other issues. They talked until approximately 5:00 PM before dispersing. The committee members were originally scheduled to go to the capital this morning. However, due to the urgent urging from Beijing, it was decided at the meeting to go to the capital at 11:40 PM last night. The Railway Bureau specially prepared four flower-decorated carriages.</p>
<p>▲ Jiao Yitang's Remarks When this newspaper's reporter met with Mr. Jiao Yitang yesterday, Mr. Jiao said that the rise of various national salvation organizations in various places is truly a good phenomenon of national self-determination. However, without a concentrated force, the power is too weak. Therefore, overseas Chinese and Ma Zhanshan's representative Li Mingxin, as well as various organizations, established the China National Salvation Association in Guangzhou, with a general association in Shanghai and branch associations in the capitals of each province and between villages. By organizing people's self-defense groups, they can defend themselves and then govern themselves, and they can survive on their own. Everything is done automatically by the people, and true democratic politics can be realized. It is hoped that the media will promote this, and so on.</p>
<h3>Professors' Anti-Japanese Association of Various Universities Telegraphs to Inquire About Attitude Toward Attacking Jinzhou</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Professors of Various Universities in Shanghai sent a telegram to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee regarding the Japanese army's attack on Jinzhou, saying: To the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee in Nanjing: The Japanese army is approaching Jinzhou, and the situation is extremely serious. What is your attitude towards this situation? We earnestly request that you make a decision in advance and clearly announce it to the people of the country. Please do not repeat the mistake of the past and continue to use empty words to evade the issue.

<h3>Airplane Crash Yesterday Morning at Jiangkun</h3>
<p>▲ Pilots Chen Qihua and Li Lifeng</p>
<p>▲ Died Yesterday Afternoon and This Morning, Respectively</p>
<p>The Navy Aviation Office's Jiangkun airplane crashed yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Reserve officers Chen Qihua and Li Lifeng were practicing inverted flight at Hongqiao Airport, at a height of only 200 feet. Unexpectedly, at 9:30 AM, the plane suddenly spiraled downward, and the fuselage crashed to the ground, causing complete damage. Chen and Li were seriously injured and immediately sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Chen died at approximately 12:00 PM. Li was treated in every possible way, but his breathing was barely existent, and his life was in extreme danger. At 0:20 AM this morning, he finally died of his injuries. The details of the accident are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Hongqiao Airport There are nine graduates from the second class of the Navy Aviation Office practicing land flight at Hongqiao Airport, with six airplanes. They start practicing every day at 7:00 AM. Recently, since the diplomatic situation with Japan has become urgent, the office has intensified its work and started flying practice at 5:00 AM every day, in order to become proficient and prepare for future national defense cooperation.</p>
<p>▲ Cause of the Accident Foreigners often buy and sell parts at Hongqiao Airport and come to the airport to test fly. Therefore, the flying methods are intricate and designed to show off skills. Aviation office personnel, unwilling to appear weak, also compete to show off and innovate, with upside-down takeoffs and landings and everything else. The lower the flight, the more obvious the movements, and the easier it is to cause accidents. Therefore, there have been two previous accidents.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday Morning's Situation The practice personnel at the office are practicing flying for national defense purposes. In battle, they need to use machine guns to strafe in the air, so they need to turn the plane face down to fly in order to fire. Chen Qihua and Li Lifeng were flying the twin-engine Morse-style Jiangkun airplane, soaring in the sky at a height of approximately 200 feet, and practicing inverting. During the flight, they were not careful, and the plane began to spiral straight down. It was impossible to stop the descent once started, and in an instant, it crashed to the ground. The Jiangkun plane was immediately destroyed and could not be used again. Other students, seeing that the accident had occurred, rushed forward to rescue them.</p>
<p>▲ Tragic State of Death and Injury When Chen Qihua crashed, his skull was flipped out, and his hands and feet were broken. He was rushed to the Orthopedic Hospital, but the hospital refused to accept him. He was then sent to Baolong Hospital, which also did not accept him. Soon after, he died and was sent to the Wan Guo Funeral Parlor. Li Lifeng was injured in the head, anus, legs, and feet, and he was bleeding heavily and vomiting blood. His condition was also critical. After being injected with cardiac stimulants and blood transfusions, he was still in danger. According to the doctor, it would not be possible to diagnose whether he could escape danger until the morning (this morning). But at 0:20 AM this morning, the treatment was ineffective, and he died in the hospital.</p>
<p>▲ Age of the Deceased Chen Qihua was 24 years old, from Fuzhou. Li Lifeng was 20 years old, from Fuzhou. Both had graduated from the Central Aviation School and came to Shanghai to practice land flight at the Navy Aviation Office. Li was especially bold, brave, and skilled in flying, with agile movements. Unfortunately, he died, which is a great misfortune in the midst of national crisis.</p>
<h3>Prediction of Falling Rice Prices</h3>
<p>▲ Detailed Report from the Food and Agriculture Commission</p>
<p>▲ Fixed-Price Foreign Rice Hurts Farmers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Food and Agriculture Commission held its 31st regular meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau on the afternoon of December 19th. Commissioners Feng Liutang, Wu Huanru, Wu Juenong, Huang Gutong, Zhu Yinong, and fifteen others attended. Feng Liutang chaired the meeting, and Zhu Fuzeng took the minutes. First, the chairman reported: (1) The meeting was suspended last month due to handling disaster relief matters and the lack of important motions. (2) Before September 18th of this year, many people were worried that the rice price would rise next year due to the severe disasters and rice shortage, so they rushed to order foreign rice from abroad. Unexpectedly, after the Northeast Incident occurred, due to diplomatic and monetary issues, the rice price suddenly fell. The fixed-price rice and small ground rice fell by almost half of the original price. From the traditional Chinese point of view, low food prices are beneficial to the poor. However, from another perspective, low grain prices hurt farmers, and most rice merchants are losing money. The crisis is hidden and is not a blessing for society. Currently, the four- or five-month futures orders for small ground rice have reached five taels. If the rice merchants in the inland continue to order, the rice market will be even more out of control, and the suffering of farmers and merchants will deepen. However, this time the rice price is indeed affected by the current situation, and the people's food supply next year will not repeat the mistakes of the 17th year. (3) Although it is difficult to be completely accurate, the amount of foreign rice registered by the Social Affairs Bureau is not too far off. The amount of foreign rice ordered that has already been registered this year, as of December 17th, is 305,640 bags of Western rice, 1,416,700 bags of small ground rice, 111,000 bags of Mindang rice, and 20,000 bags of Jia Ladi rice, for a total of 1,853,340 bags. The amount registered as having arrived at the port is 515,840 bags. In the first half of this month, a total of 300,000 bags of foreign rice were registered for order, compared to 516,000 bags in the same period in November, a decrease of 200,000 bags, which shows a glimpse of the trend. Furthermore, the average price of foreign rice ordered this month is also much lower than before. This phenomenon should be considered, and each should report on the rice situation as a standard for deciding the direction. Next, Commissioner Cai Yukun reported that the Miscellaneous Grain Association has investigated the number of orders and stocks from various foreign firms and warehouses in order to understand the rice situation in the city. However, according to the report, there is a shortage of 600,000 bags of rice in Yangon this year. The reason for the low rice market situation is that one reason is that Japanese merchants have stopped purchasing, which has greatly affected sales. Another reason is that the quality of Western rice is not good, and some of the delivered goods have been found to be damp, so it cannot be compared with last year's prices. A third reason is that the disaster in the inland is not as urgent as it was in August. Hankou and other places have stopped purchasing for a long time, while Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces still have a surplus. In summary, these factors, coupled with the extremely tight money supply and the banks' reluctance to provide mortgages, have caused the rice price to gradually fall. The Miscellaneous Grain Association will submit a report to the Social Affairs Bureau for reference after collecting various reports. Commissioner Zhu Zixiang reported briefly that the prices of wheat and soybeans are falling consistently, and the farmers' economy will be bankrupt in the future, and merchants will also be affected. He is currently petitioning the Social Affairs Bureau to find a way to remedy the situation. Finally, the chairman stated that today's meeting failed to decide on the people's food plan for the coming year. All commissioners should consider this matter carefully and report to the meeting with practical materials for research. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>American Steamer Collides with Japanese Boat in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>▲ Naval Steamboat Sinks in the River</p>
<p>▲ Six Soldiers Who Fell into the Water Were Rescued</p>
<p>▲ Requesting Compensation for Salvaging the Sunken Boat</p>
<p>▲ Collision Due to Turbulent Current The Japanese Navy's First Overseas Squadron flagship, Atago, is currently docked in the Huangpu River. Six naval soldiers on the ship went ashore on business, and at 7:00 AM yesterday, they specifically released a small steamboat to be docked at the New Customs Wharf. When the boat was traveling in the river in front of the French Concession, an American steamer came up behind it. At that location in the middle of the river, there were two American destroyers, the 221 USS Simpson. The American steamer approached and met the Japanese navy's steamboat. Because there were warships docked in the river, they could not yield to each other. At this time, the river flow was very turbulent, and the Japanese steamboat also did not give way. As a result, there was a collision.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Boat Capsizes The Japanese steamboat was extremely small, and it could not withstand the turbulent current. The small boat still opened full throttle and risked advancing, wanting to pass the American boat first. Unexpectedly, the water was rapid and the boat was fast, and the American boat was also moving forward. The rear of the small steamboat was hit by the American boat. The Japanese soldiers' steamboat immediately overturned in the river. The hull was broken, and it sank immediately. All six Japanese soldiers fell into the river.</p>
<p>▲ Soldiers Escape Danger After the Japanese steamboat sank, the six Japanese naval soldiers, with their usual knowledge of swimming, were able to struggle to swim in the Huangpu River in the severe cold. They climbed onto the civil ships docked at the location and were rescued by the boatmen from various ships. They were brought ashore with water at the French Concession dock and immediately hired a small rowboat to send them to the Atago warship to report the accident. The American steamer continued to sail out of port as usual.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Warship Negotiates Upon receiving the report, the Atago warship immediately sent personnel to the scene of the accident to inspect. They investigated the American steamer that caused the collision and reported to the Japanese consul in Shanghai, who filed a protest with the American steamer company, requesting compensation for the loss of the sunken boat. Furthermore, because the sunken steamboat was a special-purpose boat for the Atago warship, and the hull was in good condition, it was heard yesterday that the warship had decided to ask the Shanghai branch of the Tokyo-based salvage company to salvage it immediately so that it could be repaired and used again.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Dispute Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Petition from the City Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>▲ Opinions from Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Central Government, the Executive Yuan of the National Government, and the Ministry of Industry, requesting a thorough investigation into the takeover of the Chamber of Commerce by the Business Operations Committee.  Various trade associations have also declared their non-participation in the Business Operations Committee. The original texts of the letters and telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Central Government: To the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of Nanjing, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry: On the 11th of this month, Zhang Zilian suddenly led several dozen people in plain clothes and short attire to the Chamber of Commerce, claiming to take over. Zhao Nangong also delivered an official letter signed by the Shanghai Special Municipality Business Operations Committee, stating the significance of the establishment of the organization in accordance with the Central Government's order, believing that it was necessary to restore the Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce. After a meeting, it was decided to send the Minister of Organization, Zhao Nangong, the Minister of Special Affairs, Liu Musu, and the Secretary, Chen Zhiying, etc., to take over, etc. The momentum was fierce, causing obstruction to the Chamber of Commerce's office. Fortunately, the Municipal Government was immediately notified by telephone and sent police to protect and maintain order at the Chamber of Commerce, so as to avoid accidents. The Chamber of Commerce is still operating as usual, and has issued an important announcement and a joint statement from all executive and supervisory committee members, expressing a law-abiding and upright attitude. However, the Business Operations Committee has continued to publish declarations in various newspapers for several days, and Feng Shaoshan, in the name of the chairman, gave a speech to reporters, saying that it would promote business operations under the leadership of the leaders of the Kuomintang, etc., which is deeply suspicious. It is noted that since the 15th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 20th of the 18th year passed the Chamber of Commerce Law and was promulgated and implemented by the National Government, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has repeatedly issued orders to various provinces and cities to reorganize according to the law. The Chamber of Commerce was also formally established in accordance with the law on June 22nd of the 19th year, under the guidance of personnel from the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and all executive and supervisory committee members were elected, and the articles of association were passed and reported separately for approval on record. It has been more than a year and a half now, but the Business Operations Committee suddenly claimed to have received an order from the Central Government to take over and restore the Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce. It is noted that the chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities, such as Beiping and Tianjin in the north, and Guangzhou and Hankou in the south, have been changed from general chambers of commerce to municipal chambers of commerce in accordance with the law. The Business Operations Committee claims to restore the Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce, but does not know on what legal basis it has this name. Moreover, in the official letter of the Business Operations Committee, there are also words such as the Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce was illegally reorganized by the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters in April of the 18th year. It is noted that the unification of the Shanghai merchant group organization was decided by the 7th, 13th, and 14th standing committee meetings of the Central Government in May of the 18th year. The chairmen of the three meetings were Committee Member Sun Ke, Committee Member Ye Chu-cang, and Committee Member Hu Hanmin. The organizational outline of the Shanghai Special Municipality Merchant Group Reorganization Committee was also drafted and passed based on the proposals of six committee members including Committee Member Hu Hanmin. At that time, the central government was unified and sound. The Business Operations Committee refers to the resolutions of the three standing committee meetings of the central government as illegal, which makes the Chamber of Commerce even more puzzled as to what it considers legal. Now that peace has been realized, it is especially what the advanced members of the party and the country have shown and expected. In terms of democracy, the Chamber of Commerce is organized by trade associations, and its actions should be based on the will of the trade associations. In terms of the rule of law, it is a legal organization produced in accordance with the law, and no one can arbitrarily destroy it in any name. At this time of accepting popular opinion, there must be no such irregular act. The Business Operations Committee claims to be organized in accordance with the order of the Central Government, but does not know what it refers to. But the name must not be borrowed from others, and the law must be maintained. Therefore, a detailed telegram is sent for reporting, respectfully requesting a prompt and thorough investigation and strict prohibition, so as to reassure the merchants and respect the organization. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows and awaits orders.</p>
<p>▲ Declarations from Various Trade Associations: (1) The Noodle Restaurant Trade Association stated in a letter: "Regarding the reported representatives' meeting convened by the Business Operations Committee, the name 'Fang Zhichang' of our association is listed. Our association does not have anyone named Fang Zhichang. Therefore, a special letter is prepared to declare this, hoping for your understanding." (2) The Fenjiu Wine Trade Association stated in a letter: "The business of merchants in this city is vast and the industries are complex, leading the nation. If there is no legitimate organization to lead, it is feared that difficulties will arise. Now, the Special Municipality Business Operations Committee has suddenly sent personnel to take over the City Chamber of Commerce. The government has no laws, and the people do not understand its nature. The association is shocked. The basic organization of your chamber is purely based on the trade associations of the entire city, conforming to laws and regulations, and responding to public sentiment. The peace and tranquility of the business community depends on this. Fortunately, you have resisted with righteousness, and the foundation has not been shaken. It is hoped that you will be unyielding, persevering to the end. When it is absolutely necessary, a special meeting of member representatives must be convened to make a decision. The association is honored to be one of the member representatives and cannot remain silent, so it expresses its views, hoping for your consideration." (3) The Shanghai Knitted Goods Trade Association declared: "After reading the newspapers a few days ago, we were shocked to see that the Merchants' Sports Commission listed our association, Mai Jia. After investigation, our association has never known about this association and it must have been created by someone trying to use the name. Our association will not recognize it. In addition to investigating according to law, we will solemnly declare it again."</p>
<p>▲ Lu Xingzhuang, Chairman of the National Goods Factory Federation, gave the following answers to questions from the New Sound News Agency reporter yesterday: (Q) Did you participate in the takeover of the Chamber of Commerce by the Business Operations Committee beforehand? (A) I was in Wuxi attending the National Goods Exhibition and only returned to Shanghai at 6 pm on December 18th, so I knew nothing about the takeover of the City Chamber of Commerce by the Business Operations Committee. (Q) The name of your association is published on the Business Operations Committee's announcement, do you agree? (A) The issuance of announcements and other documents to the outside world by this association must be approved by the Standing Committee. For such major events as participating in the Business Operations Committee, it must also be decided by the Executive Committee before it can participate. This time, the name was listed without the decision of the committee and should not be recognized without authorization. Moreover, this association is organized by national goods factories and is an industrial group, with a different position from the commercial group of the City Chamber of Commerce, and has never joined the City Chamber of Commerce as a member, so there is no need to participate.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Associations in This City Deny Calling a Meeting Today</h3>
<p>▲ Does Not Comply with the Provisions of the Chamber of Commerce Law</p>
<p>The more than one hundred trade associations in this city, including mineral ash factories, cotton cloth, Western medicine, green bamboo shoots, foreign printed bleached cloth dyeing workshops, shoe leather nail shoe lasts, pawnshops, Feihua, laundry, bookstores, local goods, firewood and charcoal transportation and sales, sand boat companies, lumber industry, miscellaneous grains, retail, firewood and charcoal stores, sand flower stores, chicken and duck stores, silk and satin, fruit and local goods stores, dried tobacco, fresh pig stores, paint industry, firecrackers, pen and ink, fresh fish, measuring and weighing instruments, seafood groceries, mahogany dismantling materials, longan, rice stores, comb making, fruit and local goods, etc., yesterday issued a declaration denying the meeting of all city trade associations convened by the Business Operations Committee this afternoon, saying that they were deeply shocked to read in today's newspapers that the Business Operations Committee will convene all city trade associations on Tuesday. According to the provisions of the Chamber of Commerce Law, the membership meeting of the City Chamber of Commerce, its convening procedures are divided into two types: regular meetings and temporary meetings. Except for regular meetings, which are convened by the City Chamber of Commerce according to the year, other temporary meetings can only be convened if the executive committee of the Chamber of Commerce deems it necessary, or after a legitimate request from the trade associations. The current meeting has not been handled in accordance with the above procedures and is obviously an illegal act. Our trade associations will not recognize it. All of our trade associations are statutory organizations of various industries, and all rely on the rule of law. We cannot participate in illegally convened meetings in violation of the law, and we are opposed to the act of violently seizing the City Chamber of Commerce from beginning to end. We hereby declare this.</p>
<h3>Business Operations Committee Entertains the Press</h3>
<p>▲ Feng Shaoshan Explains the Work of the Committee</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Luofu Reports the Will of the Central Government</p>
<p>The Business Operations Committee held a banquet for reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers in the city at the Atlantic Hotel at 6 pm yesterday. More than fifty reporters from various newspapers attended. During the banquet, Feng Shaoshan first explained the significance of the committee's work, followed by Zheng Luofu, who reported the Central Government's intentions for various business operations, and then Liu Musu, Qiu You, and Xin gave speeches. The words of Feng and Zheng are recorded below: Mr. Feng said, "Today, I invited everyone here in the hope of taking this opportunity to explain. Our committee was organized by order of the Central Party Headquarters and is a Shanghai merchant movement organization. Before accepting this mission, we had requested instructions from the Central Government, which was to return civil rights to the people. We will always adhere to this intention. Since the incident of the takeover of the City Chamber of Commerce, you must have seen it in the newspapers and understood it. For our committee, it is just a job. Whether the takeover is successful or not is not a problem. The purpose of the takeover is to correct illegal organizations, restore them to their original state, and then return them to the real merchants, because the Chamber of Commerce is an organization owned by the merchants and must not be controlled by people or factions, causing the merchants to suffer endless pain. You must be clear about the so-called painful situation, especially the accounts of the Anti-Japanese Association and the National Salvation Association, which are never made public, even after repeated requests. Recently, many people have understood the nature of our committee, but there are still many who misunderstand it. Our position is to return the merchant groups that were forcibly occupied by others to the merchants. Originally, after the entire civil rights were deprived, we should try to return them to the people. If the people do not accept it, it is very pitiful, but our committee will always adhere to this intention and will never change. Therefore, many oppressed merchant groups have come to us to complain because they believe in our committee and hope that our committee will be responsible for guiding them. Our committee does not want this power and still encourages them to stand up and solve their own problems. That's all. Now, please report on behalf of the Central Government." Mr. Zheng said, "I am sent by the Central Party Headquarters to liaise with popular movements and powerful figures in Shanghai's popular organizations. The Central Government believes that now that diplomacy has failed and internal affairs are in chaos, the only way to resist foreign aggression and pacify the country is for the people to rise up and organize sound organizations to save the country together. In the past, under autocratic politics, the people suffered all kinds of oppression and exploitation, so the people must rise up and first remove all restrictions. The people must restore all the popular organizations that were oppressed by the government or those who took advantage of the party for personal gain during the autocratic government era, because popular movements are the people's own and must be reported to the government or the party headquarters, because this is the freedom and right that the people should have. Recently, the biggest thing in Shanghai is the takeover of the City Chamber of Commerce. The Business Operations Committee wants to first seize the things that were stolen by a group of thieves three years ago, and then hold a merchants' and people's congress to return them to the merchants and people, so that the merchants and people can reorganize and become a real and legal merchants' and people's organization. However, the takeover was not successful, and the City Chamber of Commerce announced the next day how legal it was. However, whether it is cooperative or not depends entirely on whether it is beneficial to the merchants and people. Since the establishment of the City Chamber of Commerce, the suffering of the merchants has been known to everyone. Moreover, you reporters here, as for the various evils committed by the Anti-Japanese Association and the National Salvation Association mentioned by Mr. Feng, the people should all rise up to resolve them. The government and the party headquarters should do their best to help, which is one of the predetermined tasks of the Merchant Movement Committee, but it has not yet achieved this goal because we have not yet returned the Chamber of Commerce to the merchants and people. Today, you reporters here should know its pain better and at the same time hope that you will help the merchants and people to seek liberation." The speeches of Liu, Qiu, etc. were roughly the same, and are omitted. The banquet ended at 9 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Declaration on Improving Party Affairs by the Party Affairs Improvement Association</h3>
<p>Declaration on Improving Party Affairs by the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Affairs Improvement Association of the Chinese Kuomintang: On the 13th of this month, the Kuomintang members in Shanghai voluntarily held a meeting at the French Law and Political College on Jin Shenfu Road to announce their opposition to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters' method of running the party and advocate a thorough reform of the party and government system. On the same day, the Party Affairs Improvement Association was organized. In the first few days, it was busy with preliminary work. On the 17th, it briefly issued ten major proposals for improving party affairs. It has been a week since the establishment of this association. The internal simple arrangements have already been made. The reasons for the establishment of this association and its clear proposals should be solemnly explained to the entire party and the entire country. The purpose of the establishment of this association is not to snatch the agency of the Municipal Party Headquarters from others, nor is it to covet the huge funds of the Municipal Party Headquarters, nor is it to compete with anyone for the number of people. It does not matter whether the agency is taken over or not. We advocate saving expenses as much as possible, and the number of party members is not necessarily required to be large. As long as there is a group of like-minded comrades who are truly willing to sacrifice and fight for the country and the nation, we are not afraid even if the number of people is small. Even if there is no agency and no funds, we can still continue to do it. This association was hastily established because everyone saw the decline and corruption of the party headquarters in various places and the dissatisfaction of the people with the party headquarters, and urgently wanted to express the true will of the majority of party members and urgently correct the bad behavior of the dregs in the general party, so they hastily opened an emergency party members' meeting to organize this association. Although a lot of people did attend that day, we know that there are still many like-minded comrades who have not been contacted and invited to participate, which the people involved in this association are very sorry for. The comrades hope that our comrades will not be bothered by these minor details and will still work together to realize our proposals. All like-minded comrades, the comrades are willing to sincerely discuss and sincerely cooperate. The fundamental shortcomings of the party headquarters in various places have always been that the party headquarters is not built on the occupation of the people, and running the party has become a special occupation. As a result, the party headquarters does not know the demands of the occupation of the people and cannot represent the will of the occupation of the people. Since the party headquarters is separated from the occupation of the people, the party headquarters will also lose its strength and will not be able to get the sincere support of the occupation of the people. Therefore, we advocate that the party should be built on the occupation of the people, and party members should be absorbed from the occupation of the people. Party members who leave the occupation should return to the occupation as soon as possible. Running the party should be done outside of one's own occupation and spare time. This can show the enthusiasm and sacrifice of the party runners. Only a very small number of staff members should receive subsidies because they have to sacrifice all their time. The rest of the people should not have subsidies and should rely on their own occupations to live. We advocate that Central Committee members should also not have salaries except for those who serve on a regular basis and during meetings, so that huge party fees can be saved, and the general speculative and corrupt people will not come to grab the party. All those who run the party are enthusiastic about the party and the country. In recent years, the attitude of the people who run the party in various places towards the people has especially made us general party members angry. Most of us party members are suffering from the lack of opportunity to correct their actions. This time, our Shanghai party members stood up for this reason. In the past, the party headquarters in various places abused their power and acted arbitrarily. They not only did not help the organization of the people's organizations, but also sent some reorganization committees to permanently occupy them, trying to create a machine for a few people, so that the people's organizations withered day by day, and the democratic forces declined day by day. In the future, the party headquarters should strive to promote the automatic organization of various people's organizations, so that the democratic forces will grow day by day and become stronger and stronger, so that the people can confront the warlords and bureaucrats, and politics will gradually move towards the road of democracy. However, the party headquarters should only fulfill the responsibility of assisting or promoting the people's organizations and should not interfere arbitrarily, hinder the automatic combination of the people, or hinder the natural development of the people's organizations. As for freedom of speech, it is the first condition for the development of democratic politics. There is no such thing as implementing the Three Principles of the People without letting the people speak. The party headquarters' oppression of freedom of speech in the past is fundamentally contrary to the Kuomintang's Three Principles of the People. No party member who truly understands the Three Principles of the People does not oppose it. Therefore, this association opposes the inspection of newspapers and various publications. As long as there are reliable persons in charge, there is no need for inspection. As for banning newspapers, bookstores, schools, etc., especially, they must go through serious legal procedures and are not the authority of the party headquarters. Resolving labor-capital disputes can also cause great abuses. In the past, in various places, unscrupulous people often took the opportunity to extort money, which most party members hated. The original intention of our party was to take advantage of the revolution to stop the labor-capital relations under the warlord politics of the past, so whenever labor-capital disputes occurred, the party headquarters often came forward to mediate, seeking to help the hard-working workers on the one hand, and on the other hand, to prevent the capitalists from being too embarrassed. Who knew that such abuses would occur later? In the future, the government should formulate detailed labor-capital mediation laws to ensure that all disputes are quickly mediated or arbitrated, and that mediation or arbitration is conducted by experts who are familiar with the situation in that area. As for the party headquarters, it must have the request of one of the parties involved before it can try to mediate, and it must have the request of both parties involved before it can arbitrate. The relationship between the party headquarters and the government must also be clearly defined in the future. In the past, the party headquarters and the government often had unclear powers, resulting in duplicate structures. In the future, they must be clearly separated, so that the powers can be unified and the responsibilities can be clearly defined. The party headquarters has the same responsibility to supervise the government at the same level and various people's organizations, but it cannot encroach on its powers. Judicial relations, the lives and property of the people, must have specialized knowledge and strict procedures before they can be handled fairly and properly. The party headquarters must never interfere. The use of personnel in the administrative organs is also related to responsibility. Party headquarters staff must not recommend the name of the party headquarters staff, so as to avoid various disreputable suspicions. Regarding the organization within the party, this association advocates the immediate implementation of a system of democratic centralism. On the one hand, the party should implement a democratic system and set an example for democratic politics. On the other hand, it should also recognize the principle of centralism, so that the leaders can exercise the necessary powers and correct the childish faults. The party is a group of comrades, so it should be democratic. The party is a tool for struggle, so it must be centralized. We demand the realization of a democratic centralism system and oppose all fraud, fabrication, bribery, and oppression. Recently, Mr. Wang Jingwei advocated the establishment of a National Salvation Conference as an organ of popular representation. This is the first step in realizing democratic politics and the only way to jointly overcome national disasters. The emergency congress of all city party members has already resolved to support this association and will naturally unite with all parties to promote its realization. In short, the purpose of this association is to unite the true revolutionary and enthusiastic party members, correct the mistakes of some of the people who ran the party in the past, create a pure and noble revolutionary group, draw a clear line with the general corrupt and degenerate elements, and then jointly seek the realization of democratic politics and jointly undertake the proposition of saving the country and the people, which will never change until death. We hereby declare this.</p>

<h3>A Teenager Shot in Fu Lu Li Road</h3>
<p>▲ Refuses to Reveal the Truth from Beginning to End</p>
<p>▲ Critically Wounded, Life in Danger</p>
<p>At around 7 pm last night, a shooting occurred involving a teenager on Fulu Li Road in the French Concession. The situation was quite peculiar. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ A Vacant House: Jianye Li, newly built at the intersection of Fulu Li Road and Qiqi Road in the French Concession, has many houses, divided into east, middle, and west sections. No. 8, Lane 5, East Section of the Li, is a single shikumen house, formerly leased to the private Zhuoyi Primary School. Later, due to the school's poor educational affairs and few students, the current situation could not be maintained. The rent was in arrears for months, and it was closed down a month ago. The house was then vacant.</p>
<p>▲ Gunshot from the Back Door: At around 7 pm last night, four men who spoke in a northern accent suddenly arrived, claiming that they needed to rent the house. To avoid trouble, the guide did not lock the back door on purpose, intending to let the tenants look at it first and then discuss the rent. Therefore, the four men broke in directly to look at it. Unexpectedly, before long, a gunshot was suddenly heard from the back door of the house. When the patrolling police officer was about to investigate, he had already caught a glimpse of a teenager in a blue robe, about 20 years old, running out calling for help.</p>
<p>▲ Teenager Falls to the Ground: The teenager ran out of Lane 6 in a panic, running and shouting, all the way to No. 1, Middle Lane, Duji Wanfu Teahouse. He was about to go upstairs when he was stopped by the shop assistant. The teenager returned to the door and fell to the ground in pain. Seeing the teenager suddenly fall to the ground, with blood flowing from his waist, everyone rushed forward and questioned him. The teenager refused to tell the truth. When everyone turned back to look for the thugs, they had already escaped in the meantime. Then, the patrolling policeman, Zhou Haijing, reported to the Shanzhong Road Police Station. The police chief immediately sent people to rush over.</p>
<p>▲ Life in Danger: When the detectives arrived, the teenager was already groaning on the ground. He did not say a word when asked. When questioned repeatedly, he only said that his surname was Yang and he was from the north. He did not need to say more about the details, and he only needed to ask the old man who opened the Gonghexing cigarette and paper shop at No. 1210 Lafayette Road to the north, and he could know everything in detail. The detectives hurriedly put him in the police car and transferred him to Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road for treatment. After examination by the doctor, the bullet entered from the left waist and pierced the back of the buttocks. It was indeed a vital part and his life was in extreme danger.</p>
<p>▲ The Case is Secret: The police station sent detectives to Lafayette Road to the north to detain Zhu of Gonghexing in the police station, but they did not get any clues. However, it was found that the store had only been opened for more than a month, and it had recently been transferred again, and the situation was also inappropriate. The inside story of the case is secret. The thugs and the teenager are probably not good people, and Gonghexing cigarette and paper store needs to be further investigated. With this process, the truth will not be difficult to come out.</p>
<h3>A Brawl Over Gambling and Dreams: Bodyguards Open Fire</h3>
<p>▲ Mistaken for Bandits in the Dark</p>
<p>▲ Firing After Ignoring the Password</p>
<p>▲ Incense Keeper and Rickshaw Puller Suffer</p>
<p>▲ Bloody Clothes Too Horrific to Bear</p>
<p>At 2:20 AM yesterday morning, in the Pengpu Security Team Second Squad, Fifth Division defense station located in the north end of Datong Road, Zhabei, Sijia Lane, an accidental shooting by security team members occurred, mistaking individuals for robbers, resulting in the death of one incense keeper and one rickshaw puller. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Platoon Leader's Report: Shangguan Rong, Captain of the Pengpu Security Team Second Squad, reported yesterday morning that Zhang Zhonghua, platoon leader of the squad's Second Platoon, reported that at 2:20 AM, squad leader Gui Xuesheng stated that Wang Xiaodi, a 39-year-old incense keeper from Haimen, Zhejiang, who worked at the Xiguan Temple in Sijia Lane, reported robbers inside the temple. The squad leader immediately led members of the volunteer team to the temple. Approaching the Guandi Temple in the darkness, they saw several people approaching. When asked for the password, they did not respond. Despite repeated orders to halt, they not only ignored the warnings but continued to approach. For self-defense, the squad leader was compelled to fire a warning shot into the air. Some of the individuals scattered and fled, while others continued to advance. Consequently, he fired a shot at ground level, unintentionally hitting the reporting incense keeper, Wang Xiaodi, and an unidentified man. Three men were apprehended inside the temple. The injured were sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment, and the three captured men were handed over to the team leader, along with squad leader Gui Xuesheng, for investigation.</p>
<p>▲ Investigation Assigned: After receiving the report, the team immediately dispatched personnel to investigate the scene. According to another injured party, Chen Weiyang, a 25-year-old rickshaw puller from Funing residing in the thatched shed at number 34 in the area (nicknamed Da Yangzi), who was returning home after his night shift. He lived near the east side of the Guandi Temple and knew Wang Xiaodi. When Wang went out to report, he instructed Chen to watch for anyone climbing the wall into the temple. Chen Weiyang has an elderly mother, Wei, 51, and a maternal grandmother, Wei Zhang, 70. The rest of the neighbors were asleep due to the late hour, making further inquiries impossible.</p>
<p>▲ The Three Suspects' Statements: The three apprehended men, when questioned by the team, identified themselves as Wang Rongfu, 26, from Ningbo; Pan Fujin, 28, from Changzhou; and Chen Lihong, 23, from Yangzhou. All three worked as painters at Pan Pinji Paint Shop, 489 North Henan Road, in the Public Concession. They claimed they were at the temple seeking dreams while gambling in a "flower society" (a type of lottery) and were mistaken for robbers by the team members, resulting in the shooting. The team dispatched personnel to Pan Pinji Paint Shop and confirmed that Wang and Pan were indeed employees, and Chen was a relative of Pan's. They confirmed that the men did participate in "flower society" gambling. However, the team noted the severity of the current situation and deemed it inappropriate for Wang and the others to gather outside late at night. Squad leader Gui Xuesheng's self-defense firing of the gun, which injured innocent people, was deemed unfortunate. Therefore, Wang Rongfu, Pan Fujin, Chen Lihong, along with squad leader Gui Xuesheng, were sent to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau for transfer to the Shanghai Local Court for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>▲ Report of Deaths and Injuries: Yesterday at approximately 1:00 PM, it was reported that the rickshaw puller being treated at Baolong Hospital had died due to the severity of his gunshot wound. The bullet had entered from behind his right shoulder and exited under his armpit, resulting in excessive blood loss. The deceased's mother retrieved his bloody clothing, cotton-padded jacket, trousers, blue and white cloth short shirt, and bedding from the hospital, weeping inconsolably. Wang Xiaodi was also shot in the right shoulder, with the bullet lodging in his lower arm bone. The bullet had not penetrated, and doctors surgically removed it. However, the arm bone was broken, and his life was in critical condition. Tan Maokun, the local security officer, stated that due to the lateness of the hour yesterday, he would report to the Shanghai Local Court today to request an autopsy.</p>
<h3>After the Tragedy at the Yong'an Cotton Mill in Wusong</h3>
<p>▲ Devastation and Debris Scattered Everywhere</p>
<p>▲ Party and Government Agencies Dispatch Investigators</p>
<p>Following the tragedy that occurred at the Yong'an Cotton Mill in Yuncaobang West, Wusong, the previous night, the army stationed in Wusong immediately arrived to suppress the situation and declared a temporary state of emergency. After the workers dispersed, armed police from the Third Squadron of the Public Security Bureau's Security Division were stationed at the factory to protect the premises and block traffic on the road in front of the factory gate. Inside the factory, offices, reception rooms, and accounting offices were found in disarray, with damaged books, desks, chairs, doors, windows, utensils, and other items scattered everywhere, indicating the extent of the damage. In addition to Jiao Lianying and others being treated at the Haibin Public Hospital, yesterday a female worker named Yang Fengquan, 16, from Changzhou, suffered a shoulder injury, with the bullet having exited from behind her shoulder. Another female worker, Lu Zhang, from Siyang, living near the Paotaiwan Fortress Command, also suffered a bullet wound through her shoulder. The injuries to these two female workers are not believed to be serious. Among the police officers injured, Wang Heting, a patrolman from the Seventh District, suffered severe head and back of the head injuries. Other injured officers included Sun Qingtai from the Third Squadron, with head and back of head injuries; Yang Jiyu, with head and hand injuries; and Fu Shiying, with head and ear injuries. All are currently receiving treatment at the hospital. Around 1:00 PM yesterday, more than ten individuals, including section chiefs and staff from the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus, as well as standing committee members from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Wusong Eighth District Party Headquarters, went to the factory to investigate and examine the damaged items, compiling a detailed list for reporting back to Shanghai. During the inspection, inside the main entrance of the office building, a blank piece of paper with the logo of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association and two torn one-dollar banknotes were found and collected by squad leader Gu for reporting and investigation. However, the factory's responsible officers are currently in Shanghai, so no concrete mediation plans have been formulated yet, and the resumption of work is not yet in sight.</p>

<h3>Failed Takeover of the Cigarette Industry Union</h3>
<p>▲ 34 Arrested</p>
<p>The Cigarette Industry Union of the Fifth District of Pudong received a tip-off the day before yesterday that thugs would seize the union that evening and immediately requested protection from the Municipal Public Security Bureau. That evening, the bureau secretly ordered the Third District of Pudong to strengthen its defenses. Director Zhang immediately dispatched a battalion commander and police officers, and consulted with the Fourth Squadron of the Police Department to send police to assist in guarding the area around the union until dawn, but nothing happened. At 10 AM yesterday, seeing no signs of unrest, the police were withdrawn. After a while, a man named Zhang Tingsheng arrived, carrying an official document, and requested to see Director Zhang of the Third District, requesting the dispatch of police to protect the takeover of the local cigarette industry union. The director, after examining the document, found it stamped with the seal of the Shanghai Special Municipality Workers' Movement Committee, but the wording was vague. The director replied that the district had not received any official procedures from the Workers' Movement Committee and was unable to provide protection. Unexpectedly, at that moment, dozens of burly men rushed into the Cigarette Industry Union, intending to seize it. However, the union had already laid an ambush inside and outside. As soon as the incident occurred, the iron gates were locked, and a slight conflict ensued. Two or three gunshots were heard. In an instant, all those who rushed in were captured, a total of 34 people, none of whom escaped. Several people on the union side sustained minor injuries. Director Zhang of the Third District, upon receiving the report, also led police to the scene and arrested all those who had been captured, along with Zhang Tingsheng, who was carrying the official document, for preliminary interrogation. According to the union representatives, Chen Peide and Gu Ruofeng, the conflict was caused by Li Changgui leading the seizure of the union. They also claimed that the group tore up the Premier's portrait and then presented three iron bars and three symbols, "stamped with the words 'Transportation Team' and 'Maintenance Team'," claiming that these were abandoned by the group. Gu Ruofeng admitted to firing two shots in self-defense. According to Li Changgui's confession, he was ordered by the Workers' Movement Committee to take over the union. The other thirty-plus people were special supervisors sent by the Workers' Movement Committee. Zhang Tingsheng's confession was the same as Li Changgui's. The names of the remaining thirty-three people are as follows: [List of names]. They all claimed to have no occupation and stated that Li Changgui ordered them to go to the union to raise their hands at the meeting. The director, believing that these people did not resemble the special supervisors sent by the so-called Workers' Movement Committee to take over the union, suspected that there was another reason. He ordered that all 34 people be tied up with ropes and escorted across the Pudong district where the Public Security Bureau dispatched two vehicles to transport them to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Another report stated that yesterday morning, the reorganization committee of the British American Tobacco Factory Union sent reorganization committee members Li Changgui, Zhang Tingsheng, and others to lead representatives from various departments to take over the union. Unexpectedly, the union committee members Chen Peide, Gu Ruofeng, and others hired many people and laid an ambush everywhere. As soon as they saw the takeover committee members, they immediately surrounded them on all sides, beating the takeover personnel, resulting in injuries to twenty people. They fired warning shots and, relying on their superior numbers, tied up the takeover personnel with ropes and handed them over to the Public Security Bureau for detention. It is heard that the reorganization committee has reported to the Workers' Movement Committee and the Shanghai Special Municipality General Labor Union, requesting that they find a way to bail out the falsely accused personnel.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhongrou, Representative of the Shanghai Labor Circle, Cables from the North</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that Chen Zhongrou, the representative of the Shanghai Special Municipality General Labor Union stationed in Guangdong, returned to Shanghai yesterday with members of the Central Committee.

Participating factories have been notified that they must continue to sell at reduced prices to reward the patronage of customers. It is also heard that a large batch of famous porcelain has recently been transported from Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, and is being sold at the emporium. The prices are said to be 60% lower than those at the porcelain shops on Nanjing Road.</p>

<h3>Cai Huifang Died Because of Marriage</h3>
<p>▲ Seeking Handwritten Letter to Assess Talent and Learning</p>
<p>▲ Suddenly Overwhelmed with Sorrow While Making Wedding Clothes</p>
<p>Sun Jingxian and Cai Huifang, two graduates of the Nanyang Girls' Middle School, committed suicide together by drowning themselves in the sea. Details of the examination have been previously reported. According to a statement from the relatives of Cai, Cai Huifang's suicide was purely due to marriage issues. The reason for Sun Jingxian's death was that she shared the same sentiment as Cai Huifang, resulting in a homosexual relationship, and they agreed to die together. According to Cai's relatives, Cai's father, Jin Tao, was engaged in the gold business and has recently suffered losses due to failed speculation. Cai, gifted by nature, graduated from the Nanyang Girls' Middle School. At the age of seven, she became engaged to the son of Lu Xiangmao, Quan Sheng. Lu lived at the corner of North Shanxi Road and Haining Road in the American Concession and ran a real estate business, accumulating hundreds of thousands of dollars. Quan Sheng was simple-minded, studied at the Huadong Public School, and dropped out halfway. Huifang learned that her fiancé was not well-versed in literature and was often depressed about it. Last year, she sent a letter to her future in-laws (Quan Sheng's parents), asking them to order Quan Sheng to write a letter in his own handwriting to assess her fiancé's learning. However, Quan Sheng hired someone to write it, which was discovered by Huifang. Therefore, Huifang strongly opposed this blind marriage, but she did not dare to disobey the orders of her parents. The wedding was scheduled for the 16th of this month according to the lunar calendar. The Lu family had already asked the original matchmaker to send the betrothal gifts, 800 yuan, and eight pieces of gray squirrel and fox fur-trimmed fine wool and silk clothing, to the Cai family. Cai's father had already invited tailors to prepare the wedding clothes at home. Both families were preparing for the joyous event and distributing wedding invitations. Unexpectedly, this tragedy occurred. The Lu family learned about Huifang's drowning only after reading the newspaper and is now asking the matchmaker to negotiate with the Cai family to return the betrothal gifts and clothing in order to arrange another marriage for their son.</p>
<h3>National Rubber Raw Materials from the New Industry Chemical Factory to Be Produced</h3>
<p>China's rubber industry is developing rapidly, with sales in Shanghai being particularly extensive. However, most of the raw materials are produced abroad, especially from Japan. Amidst the current boycott, factories are urgently seeking to manufacture their own raw materials. Although there are already many domestically produced raw materials, they are ultimately inferior to imported ones. Recently, the New Industry Chemical Factory has produced products such as calcium carbonate, zinc oxide, and lithopone, which are superior to those manufactured by other factories. Prominent factories in Shanghai, such as the Yisheng Factory, have repeatedly tested them and found that their quality is excellent and far exceeds that of imported products, while their prices are even lower. It is heard that the initiator of the factory is Mr. Chen Xiaoping, the gasoline manager of the Mobil Oil Company. Recognizing the development of the rubber industry and China's lack of domestically produced raw materials, he gathered chemical experts such as Mr. Shi Shunyin, as well as Mr. Mao Yuting, Tu Dianchen, Li Baosheng, Ling Shumei, and others from factories such as Yisheng, to raise huge sums of money and establish a factory at the intersection of Wai Rihui Port, Damuqiao, and Zhaofeng Road. Preparations have been underway for more than two years. All machinery and engineering are based on self-designed drawings and personally supervised construction. The novelty of its production methods, the spirit of its machinery, the excellence of its products, and the low prices are unmatched by any other domestic factory. The factory is currently rushing to install machinery day and night, and production is expected to begin in about a month, able to supply the needs of all rubber factories and cosmetics factories in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan Cables to Urge Efforts in Fundraising</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for the Emergency Relief of Floods in Various Provinces received a cable from Zhu Qinglan yesterday: "To the Shanghai Fundraising Association for the Emergency Relief of Floods in Various Provinces, Xu Jinglao, Wang Yilao, Qu Wenlao, Huang Hanlao, and all philanthropists: I returned to the province from Hunan this morning. More than 100,000 disaster victims have gathered in Wuhan, and the situation is extremely dire. The disaster victims in various counties are especially pitiful. The total amount of relief funds, food, and cotton clothing from all parties is still far from the amount needed. I hope that all great philanthropists on the coast will increase their fundraising efforts to provide widespread relief. Zhu Qinglan."</p>
<h3>China International Famine Relief Commission Establishes Shanghai Office</h3>
<p>Due to the severe and widespread floods in the Yangtze River basin this year, and because Shanghai is the transportation hub for the southern provinces, the China International Famine Relief Commission in Beiping, which does not yet have a branch in Shanghai, decided at its 101st meeting of the Executive Committee on the 7th of this month to invite prominent figures from Chinese and foreign communities in Shanghai to organize the Yangtze River Flood Relief Committee and establish a Shanghai office of the Commission to facilitate the work. The position of Director-General of the office will be concurrently held by Mr. Zhang Yuanshan, Director-General of the Commission. It is heard that the office is located at 23 Yuanmingyuan Road in the Shanghai Public Concession and began operating on the 16th of this month.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou Native Place Association Again Requests Continued Shelter for Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Gaoyou Native Place Association wrote to the Shanghai Municipal Disaster Relief Shelter Committee, saying: "We recently read in the newspaper that at 5:00 PM yesterday, your committee held its fourth regular meeting, and in the fourth item, regarding the Gaoyou Native Place Association's letter based on the request from disaster victim representatives to temporarily postpone their return to their original homes, a resolution was passed to reply to the association stating that the committee's dispersal is a form of financial assistance, and that the original homes are also handling winter relief after their return, so there will be no risk of freezing or starvation, etc." After reading this to the end, we cannot help but be alarmed. All of the disaster victims previously received your great shelter, for which we are endlessly grateful. However, as we enter this severe winter, the climate in Jiangbei is much colder than in Jiangnan. If they are sent back to their original homes without clothing, food, or shelter, it would be no different from driving them into ditches and gullies, putting them in a place of death. If they die in their original homes, they would still feel that they have nowhere to be buried in the vast floodwaters, so it is better to wait for death in Shanghai, where at least their bones will not be exposed to the wind and sun. Although winter relief is being handled in the disaster areas, there are millions of disaster victims, but the relief funds are limited. Just providing relief to the original disaster victims in the disaster areas is already insufficient, how can it be possible to extend it to the disaster victims returning from all directions? Moreover, disaster relief work in the disaster areas often falls into the wrong hands, and starvation deaths are heard of every day. One can get a general idea of how winter relief is being handled. Since your esteemed committee has generously provided financial assistance for dispersal, why not request that the funds for dispersal be used for the purpose of providing sustenance, continuing to maintain them, and then dispersing them in the spring? We deeply hope that your esteemed committee will thoroughly save people, so as not to lose the original intention of your esteemed committee's compassion. Or, please transfer the matter to various charitable relief associations in Shanghai for reception and management. Saving one less person can save one more life. We are extremely eager for this to happen."</p>
<h3>Xu Zhimo's Memorial Service Held at Jing'an Temple</h3>
<p>The new poet Xu Zhimo died in an accident on the 19th of last month near Jinan while traveling to Beiping on the Jinan aircraft. After his coffin was transported to Shanghai, it was temporarily placed in the International Funeral Parlor. Yesterday, a memorial service was held at Jing'an Temple in western Shanghai. Starting at 8:00 AM, mourners came in an endless stream. The hall was fully decorated with fresh flowers, with a half-body portrait of the poet in the center, more than two zhang tall, with a lively spirit, lifelike. The hall had three sections, and condolence couplets were hung all around. Cai Yuanpei, Ye Yuhu, Zhang Xiaolin, Mei Lanfang, Chu Minyi, Xu Xinliu, and others all had eulogies. In particular, Xu Xinliu's couplet was the most appropriate, with the lines "The wheel forever turns, the new moon forever hangs, though dead, I can't forget Julia," "The fierce tiger has not been eliminated, the jadeite is forever cold, this hatred should accompany Mansfield." These were composed by collecting the titles of the poet's works. The public memorial groups included the Crescent Society, the entire student body of Guanghua University, the PEN Club, the China Society, the Times Printing Company, the Longma Film Company, and the China Poetry Society. Xu's friends from his lifetime were also all present. Furthermore, people from the banking, legal, and literary and artistic circles, such as Ye Gongchuo, Zhang Gongquan, Xu Xinliu, Xie Shoukang, Luo Longji, Wang Wenbai, Zhang Weici, Pan Guangdan, Wu Jingxiong, Ying Shi, Yang Xingfo, Ge Gongzhen, Qian Shoutie, Chen Xiaodie, Han Xiangmei, Tang Ying, Jiang Xiaoqian, Zhang Guangyu, Shao Xunmei, Zhang Zhenyu, Lin Huiyin, Meng Shouchun, and others, were busy receiving guests. It is said that his coffin will soon be transported back to his original home in Haining, but his close friends Cai Yuanpei, Ye Yuhu, Yang Xingfo, and Hu Shih are planning to initiate a public funeral ceremony, which is currently being prepared.</p>

<h3>Beijing Apartment in the French Concession Penalized</h3>
<p>▲ Violation of Stamp Tax Regulations</p>
<p>The stamp tax specialists of the French Concession, Liu Chunpu and Shen Rulin, based on a report by an informant, stated that the account books used by the Beijing Apartment at 439 Rue de la Paix did not have sufficient stamps affixed in violation of regulations. They duly reported the situation to the Shanghai Special Zone Stamp and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau of the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau, which then requested the French Municipal Police to order investigators to notify the Beijing Apartment to bring all the books to the case. Specialist Liu Chunpu personally went to the investigation department of the Municipal Police to investigate them one by one and found that there were ten account books in which the stamps affixed were not up to the required amount, violating Article 5 of the Stamp Tax Regulations. Therefore, the police station filed a lawsuit with the Second Special District Local Court. As the owner of the apartment, Liu Liankui, was ill, Chen Fangting appeared on his behalf. After questioning by Judge Ma, it was decided to fine him 10 yuan per account book, for a total fine of 100 yuan, in order to serve as a warning.

<h3>Inquiry from Old Man Xiu Shan, Over Seventy Years Old</h3>
<p>(Advocating that the people's economic boycott of Japan should not be relaxed even for a moment, or all will be lost.)</p>
<p>Japan's ability to invade us with military force today is all due to our years of contributing to its economic power. Before the Meiji Restoration, Japan was a hundred times poorer than us. It was through seizing our Beiyang Navy warships in the Sino-Japanese War, demanding reparations of 230 million taels, taking our Taiwan and Korea, and then taking the East Province lease rights under the pretext of victory over the Russians in the Russo-Japanese War, and plundering our Qing imperial treasures in the Boxer Rebellion, dividing the reparations of 34 million taels. The Manchu government was repeatedly subjected to political pressure, allowing Japan to trade in various inland ports, eliminating tariffs, building factories, and operating shipping lines. Our people were also subjected to economic pressure, working for them in various companies, shops, factories, and ships. Their economic power grew day by day, investing in and operating railways, mines, forests, and various industrial and commercial enterprises in the three northeastern provinces, expanding their naval, land, and air force strength, and repeatedly invading us and massacring us in various cases. According to the chronologies compiled by Mo Yi and Jing Heng, it is difficult to count them all. This time, on September 18, they forcibly occupied Liaoning and Shenyang at night without reason. Our defending officials adopted a policy of non-resistance, allowing them to plunder the military equipment and money accumulated over tens of millions of years, and then using it to buy bandits and arm them, harassing our various places. As the saying goes, "frying my bones with my oil" - what could be more tragic and heartbreaking than this? We have boycotted Japanese goods eight or nine times, but all have been ineffective because we are quick to forget. Europeans and Americans ridicule us for our five-minute enthusiasm, and the Japanese laugh at us for acting like children. This time, the economic boycott, although relying on the leadership and maintenance of various organizations, must be understood by everyone that Japan's ability to repeatedly invade us with military force is all due to our years of contributing to its economic power. In the future, if we still love to use Japanese goods and love to serve the Japanese, directly contributing to their economic power and indirectly expanding their military power, it is tantamount to handing them a knife to put on our heads. Are all Chinese people like Uncle Bao, completely without heart or liver? Now, the Japanese goods that have been sealed up have already been bought with our money. Burning them would hurt our vitality, and selling them would cause problems. Sealing them up for a long time will stagnate finance, and there are many different opinions, but no perfect solution has been seen. The only thing to do is to use a quick knife to cut through the tangled hemp, and publicly auction them off in a set time, distinguishing between those that have been registered and those that have not, and increase the levies to donate to disaster relief or create a fund for domestic goods, to permanently eliminate their desire to sell Japanese goods. Employees who have resigned and left their jobs should find other ways to make a living. Raw materials and daily necessities that used to come from Japanese goods must be imitated and replaced with domestic goods as soon as possible. China has a large number of cheap labor and abundant raw materials. Why not use them to manufacture and enjoy them ourselves, but instead allow the Japanese to use them to control us, adding wings to the tiger, making it fly and eat people? Why don't the people of our country know the life-and-death stakes? Even if Japan changes its attitude and adopts a friendly Sino-Japanese facade, temporarily resolving the issue of the three northeastern provinces with us, their conspiracy will never change in the end. Tangible slogans and leaflets can be canceled, but the intangible policy of non-cooperation should be promoted and implemented forever. It is unknown when the government will use military force to recover the lost territories. The people, without military resistance, have only this one move to take Japan's life. Even a moment of slackness will result in eternal loss. I am afraid that in the future, even the Japanese will not allow us to be the slaves of India's Gandhi. My humble opinion is as such. I sincerely ask that you publish it in your newspaper. In the future, when we win the economic war, your newspaper's contribution to propaganda will far outweigh that of 100,000 Mauser rifles. Xiu Shan currently lives at 22 Yuhou Lane, Triangle Area, Xujiahui, Shanghai. He is over 70 years old, his hands tremble, his eyes are blurred, and it is very difficult to write. Also, there is no one to write for him, so his handwriting is scribbled. Please forgive him.</p>
<p>(Reply) The old gentleman's patriotic enthusiasm gushes out from his writing. All of us younger generations are respectful and moved. However, we colleagues believe that the method for disposing of sealed Japanese goods should be to postpone them to a reasonable time and then concentrate and publicly auction them off, as advocated by Gao Zhongxia in yesterday's column, as this is more appropriate. If we sell them now, even if it is concentrated and public, it will still be promoting the use of Japanese goods, and at the same time, we are advising the people not to use Japanese goods, while allowing the people to openly buy and use Japanese goods, which will completely undo the efforts of the past three months. This point should be seriously considered. The general principle should be to endure the pain for the time being.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Sir, Yesterday, your newspaper carried a news item saying that the Central Committee members entered Beijing together and that the Railway Bureau also sent staff members Chen Qubing and Xu Shibin to take care of them at the station. After checking, our office only has Chen Henian and Xu Shibin, and there is no Chen Qubing. It is a mistake in your reporting. Please publish it in the corrections column to avoid spreading the error. Sincerely, the chief editor of the editorial department, North Station Reception Office, December 21.</p>
<p>Sir, I read in your newspaper yesterday in the local news column that the All-City Federation of Trade Unions Congress was attended by our association. After checking, our association did not attend or participate. However, Xia Hailin, who is among the supervisory committee members, is the former standing committee member of our association, but he has already resigned. I hereby declare that we do not recognize him. Please publish this letter to clarify the truth. Sincerely, the editorial department of the Shen Bao, Shanghai City Lead-Qiu Industry Industrial Union, December 21.</p>
<p>Sir, After checking the report of the "Judgment of the Salt Merchant Family Lawsuit" published in the local news column of your newspaper on the 20th of this month, the situation described in the verdict does not conform to the truth. The reason is that recently, the defendants Zhang Shiying and Gu Zunting ordered to hand over the deeds of the fields and houses under the name of the plaintiff Zhang Yexiu, which were managed on their behalf, so the defendant Zhang Shiying was acquitted. All civil litigation parts, (ie, the part of encroachment on public property,) are transferred to the Civil Court for trial. There is no word of rebuttal against the plaintiff. I am deeply afraid of confusing the audience, and I hereby request that you correct it to conform to the facts. Sincerely, the local editorial department of the Shen Bao, Zhang Yexiu, December 21.</p>

<h3>A DULL DORMITORY</h3>
<p>— Huo Jin</p>
<p>The weather is so dim and gloomy, the room is simply stuffy and dark. Miss Gu and I listlessly stare at the newspaper, sometimes stretching, taking a stroll around the room.</p>
<p>Miss Jin went to take her sick younger sister home. Miss Yin took off her volunteer uniform, permed her hair, and went back to Zhenjiang to get engaged. In dormitory number ten, only Miss Gu and I are left, facing the wall in quiet loneliness.</p>
<p>Outside the eaves, a fine, drizzling rain is falling, so everyone is unable to go out, shrinking their necks and hiding in their own rooms, repeatedly heating things to eat on the alcohol stoves.</p>
<p>Because of the planned petition and demonstration, all the schools had already announced a suspension of classes. Our law school's Dean Shen saw that while some students were engaged in patriotic movements, others were idle and wasting their youth, which he felt was a great pity. So, he advocated resuming classes early to enrich young people's knowledge. Who knew that on the first day of resuming classes, less than one-third of the students came to class. The second day, the third day... there were even fewer each day. Some professors didn't even come. The bell rang loudly, but no one paid any attention to it.</p>
<p>In normal times, the classrooms are full of students attending classes, the publishing department students are crowding around to receive handouts, the consumer cooperative is busy buying things, the students in the gatehouse are fighting to receive letters, and the young ladies are even busier calling for their "nannies" to buy peanuts, bananas, and candy to enjoy. In the women's dormitories, the sound of men's leather shoes echoes constantly. But now, the classrooms are closed and deserted, the publishing department students naturally don't bother to patronize it, the consumer cooperative is deserted and enveloped in a lonely atmosphere, the letters in the gatehouse will be delivered to the rooms by the tea boy, the sound of leather shoes in the women's dormitories is so quiet as to be almost inaudible, and the "nannies" are hiding in their rooms making shoe soles, spending half the day without anyone calling for them, happy to save their shoes from carrying their heavy bodies around.</p>
<p>What is the reason for this? Is it because, with the national crisis at hand, the tyrannical Japanese are pressing us, the government has no power to deal with them, and young students have no choice but to first petition their own government, then demonstrate, and then even declare war on the Japanese imperialists and engage in direct conflict? The result is a city filled with gloomy clouds and storms. The representatives are busy meeting, the secretaries are busy seeking news, other people are nervously stepping up military training, and the idle people, with nothing to do, sit listlessly in their rooms, reading newspapers and killing time, sighing and lamenting, expressing their anger and resentment. Some, even in broad daylight, go into the land of dreams to pursue sweet pleasures.</p>
<p>As for the female students, there was originally an organization called the "ambulance corps," but these spoiled young ladies, who would be willing to crawl out of their warm, fragrant, and powdered quilts in the cold and bone-chilling morning to taste the dew? Furthermore, when they saw in the newspapers that the Southeast Aid-Heilongjiang Ambulance Corps was stranded in Peiping, unable to cross the border to fulfill their long-cherished wish to aid in rescuing the country, they were forced to disband, which made them wary of ambulance work, even discouraged.</p>
<p>Since our national affairs have reached such a stagnant state, the students whose blood is boiling — the so-called highly educated students — both male and female — although they are all burning with patriotic sentiments of throwing their whips into the river and breaking down Fusang (Japan), when they have energy but nowhere to use it, and anger but nowhere to vent it, they have no choice but to bury themselves in small snail-shell-like rooms in frustration. The current disorganization of the law school students is a perfect representation of the dismal state of resisting Japan and saving the country.</p>
