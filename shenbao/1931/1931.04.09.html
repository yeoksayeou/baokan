<p>英政府邀德總理及外長赴英集議。歐洲各國。今甚重視之。原夫英之所邀。不僅德之一國。在法雖未允赴。亦未拒絕。在意有謂亦在邀請之列。但以各國情勢之不同。故對於邀請。見解各異。在德國之意。正在德奥稅約議論紛紜之時。英旣未嘗表示劇烈之反對。而又有此邀請集會之舉。於外交上自屬有利而無害。故國内無分黨派。一致熱烈歡迎。柏林日報。且認爲歐戰後英德重行携手之表示。其贊成此舉。可想而知焉。</p>
<p>自歐戰以後。國際之聯合。幾有一定之方式不過戰勝之若干强國。互相分配。其餘之國。俯首受命而已。無所謂外交。更無所謂縱横捭闔之策也。自去年以來。德於國聯會中。稍稍露其頭角。博得各國之聲譽。迨至近來。乃有德奥稅約之發展。使國際呆滯之局勢。别開一生面。今又有英德非正式集會之舉動。歐洲外交之形勢。或將因是而有變動。宜乎各國之鄭重視之也。</p>

<p>一鼓作氣華北猛攻</p>
<p>華北之軍、衣半藍半白之戎裝、列陣向南、華中諸將則黄阿紅衣、象徵其所抱之鐵血主義、整軍北伐、裁判員陳吉祥銀笛一聲、戰幕遂揭、華北開球、趙　鋒　目遠眺、一傳至右、黄玉佳舉兵深入、軍行神速、華中左衛程國印於是嚴重時期、竟讓失漏而去、偪成角球、黄玉佳落點極佳、黄振聲猛力攻門、惜越木飛去、轉瞬華北五鋒、連翩又至、聯絡極佳、敏捷迅速之至、華中門前、盡爲華北前鋒出没之所、察此形勢、知華北可佔優勝也、</p>

<p>華中在此嚴重情勢、極力救護、一得機會、即行反攻、李本心一蹴而至王以德、機會甚佳、華北防衛甚疎、惜傳球無力、又爲截去、蕭勃遠傳、球至中鋒、王長頴亦告失足、華中大好機會無甚接應、功虧一簧、虞克定造球飛傳、袁中鋒左右進盤、羨鍾芬阻之亦失、幸王稦趕來、撥出界外、華中聲勢、亦未可輕輕放過也、嗣華北雖又猛撃、終以射門不準、悵悵無已、上半時遂零比零終局</p>

<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>當此春光駘蕩之天。滬上房屋林立。每苦無放紙鳶之地。不若鄉村則田之間草野之中、隨處皆宜。於是滬地兒童。見有拆屋翻造處即視爲放紙鳶佳地、課餘之閒。咸持各色紙鳶。迎風向空而放。五光十色映射於金黄色日光之中别有奇觀。惟偶一不愼、紙鳶翻身、而電桿木上之電缐、情面毫無、必使紙鳶粉身碎骨而後已。此乃滬人放鳶之不便。我校附近有曠塲一。亦爲拆屋翻造處。日暖風和之天。塲中日必有無數兒童。爭放紙鳶。因使我憶及去年香港發生之一塲紙鳶官司。個中情形。彌可發噱。蓋香港境内、華人不少。每至春日。兒童之放紙鳶者、亦大不乏人。惟香港一地。自强英割去後。一切市政專權。悉操於英人之手。對於兒童嬉戲。有時亦受當局干涉去年香港有一兒童放紙鳶時。爲當局所拘。開庭辬論。亦有律師出庭。以律師而辦理放紙鳶件。殆亦别開生面之事也。法庭方面。以此童在魯濱遜街放紙鳶時。曾損環電報綫及某姓坡璃窗。實爲違法。蓋嬉戲之事。有碍居民或行人者。法律載明當局亦有禁止之權。然被告律師。要求證明放紙鳶一事。是否列入嬉戲。並詢廷上此次所傷者何人。所損者何物。法官謂並未傷人惟無論如何。放紙鳶而觸及電綫。必爲違法之事律師又詢其此種法律。係根據何條、並請當庭檢出、詎法官將律書遍翻一過。竟無此種法律。因而一塲紙鳶官司。終於宣告無罪。</p>

<p>不佞愛金魚成癖。前年供職杜美路明星總公司時文牘部同仁。嘗晋我以金魚博士之徽號。過承藻飾。更不敢負愛我者之一番美意。於是博訪周諮。採集關於藝魚之材料。藉供一般同嗜者之採納焉。</p>
<p>一咋子夜。與王獻齋君訪東三省影片經理郭于兩君於中央四樓。于君魯人。即詢以藝魚之術。蓋我國金魚。生長魯省。以濟寗濟南兩縣出産爲大宗。此則不佞所親歷而目覩者也于君飽學之士。語誠不虚。于君之言曰、君等僅知金魚爲卵生實不知人工亦可種植也。余甚訝之。于謂金魚之原始實與蠅蛃之類相伯仲。旣可卵生復可濕生、卵生則孵卵耳。人工則甚覺奇特。法以　蠶子入水。水無庸大。經需經丈之池即可。池底有泥。下蠶子其間。任其受日光曝之。使陰雨連朝。亦聽之可也。一俟大伏過後。水底游魚。千百成羣。日飼以水蛆。便長大矣。于君又謂欲金魚成紅色。則取黄蠶種下之。欲其成白。則下白種。欲其紅白相間。則取花蠶種亦如之。余初不之信。繼而于引證禮記月令是月也腐草化爲螢一語。余始恍然。尙有藝魚術。未便多佔自由篇幅。已付刊「新家庭」月刊矣。</p>

<p>紙鳶之設。乃使小兒仰面夫内熱。亦以袪病爲目的。一年之中。在氣候變換時。人身氣血亦即起大變調故老年人往往在二至二分。及四立時節。大發舊病。小兒體質薄弱。正與老人衰弱者同故於令節。必有一二預防時疾之藥餌。用於食物中。但皆　焉而不察耳。清明之麥苗。即其一例用以袪除内熱。其效用正與紙鳶同。宫室之中。承塵往往藻繪極工。亦正使萬畿叢睉之身。常得仰面嘘氣。以袪五中煩熱。元夜張燈。其時在立春後。亦使萬人昂首而觀。袪其内熱。用意至爲微妙。然而吾人終歲埋頭。則未免太不衛生矣。</p>
<p>清明插柳。俗謂切魂以予推想。殊不謂然。西槳以柳醲治熱病。及解血毒極效。柳酸即自柳條之嫩皮中提出。亦稱沙利先酸。清明節後。則楊柳生花。柔條變老。所含養分。尸都消失。故在清明前折取之。插於門外。所以使以使行人旅客之取用也。其用意。亦爲治療天花水痘而設。凡患痘症。忽而回落。不能透發。則熱毒内陷。其人必死。若以水楊柳煎湯　拭。則痘粒立即復顯。紅潤飽滿。熱毒由毛孔排洩而出。無不活者。如在天花流行時。以此煎服。則清熱解毒。能利小便。引熱下行尤治痢疾。但以清明插褚柳葉煎服良效故予以爲此等設備。正與端午插蒲艾於門。所以便行人之中暑患痧者同。又小兒以清明柳條作圈。套於頸項。蓋以防喉痧瘰𤻤癤瘍諸症。頭爲衆陽之首。頸則百脉所經。亦取柳酸能解血毒。使自毛孔入也。以柳圈套之狗頸。則狗好弄。必去其圈嚙之。亦以防止　狗與瘋狗而已。</p>

<p>印度之運動。近英國已大受打撃。所有英貨一律不用。他國亦受影響。惟東洋方面。日本貨爲之暢銷。以海關論。從前日可收一百三五十萬稅。今則减至三五十萬。一日减去一百萬。其受打撃可知。現大都會尙可收房捐。鄉下抗稅甚盛。不易收也。有印人一開木匠店者告我。其廠内昔百五十工人。今止十人。商業之衰可知。英人所僱印人當兵者多屬於尼泊爾人。十之七八。至總數難確知。或云四五十萬尼泊爾人强悍。英人僱以當兵。故英人不能以兵力制尼泊爾也。尼泊爾八曾助英於歐戰。以勇顯於歐洲。未可輕視。今英人入藏阻其路者。惟尼泊爾也。至不丹小邦。亦佛敎國。然久爲英保護。道階法師言。不丹國佛像甚美今北境惟此兩佛敎國。南境惟一錫蘭島耳。</p>
<p>印度將來有問題其在士爾基乎。印度西北境盡回敎諸國。現在未能全助印人者。以阿富汗等國。尙爲王國與英尙有同情。然其人民頗與印民聯絡接濟。有一大問題即土爾基之鐵道將延長而通至波斯地方。此鐵道爲從君士坦丁來者其欵爲土德俄三國之欵北路通。則俄德土之勢力可聯合也。波斯境近印度西部之孟買地方土爾基自改爲共和政體後。國勢亦强。未可侮也。</p>

Today's Sichuan telegrams are as follows: (1) Chengdu, 8th day: Deng Xihou and Tian Songyao's original attack on Li Qixiang was first agreed upon by Liu Wenhui. Later, Liu Xiang repeatedly telegraphed Liu Wenhui, explaining the advantages and disadvantages and appealing to their uncle-nephew relationship, persuading him to lean towards the center and maintain peace. Liu's intention was slightly moved, so he remained in a wait-and-see attitude. Deng and Tian, knowing they were isolated, immediately stopped advancing and requested that the Chongqing army also stop advancing, etc. (2) Chengdu, 8th day: Liu Wenhui telegraphed Liu Xiang, inviting him to meet in Luzhou. Liu Xiang replied that as long as it is beneficial to the party and the country, he can go to the province, and it is not necessary to meet in Luzhou. Liu Wenhui changed the meeting place to Jiangjin, and it is expected to take place before the 15th. (3) Chengdu, 8th day: Yang Sen, when the Sichuan war was fierce, planned to lead his troops to advance towards Guang'an. Now, due to the ceasefire, he has changed to advancing towards Dazhou.

The agreement could have been signed and work resumed in the afternoon. However, in the afternoon, the company raised questions to the Municipal Government, saying that the central government promulgated the Trade Union Law, which should be based on workers, and that the Ji'an Waterworks Union not only has employees of the company as members, but also several directors and supervisors of the union are employees. Such unions that do not conform to the Trade Union Law are difficult to recognize. Therefore, the official mediation has completely broken down.

<h3 id="e22">Britain Invites German Dignitaries to London <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The British government invited the German Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to Britain for a meeting. European countries are now paying great attention to this. Originally, what Britain invited was not just Germany alone. Although France did not agree to go, it did not refuse. In Italy, it is said that it is also on the list of invitations. However, due to the different situations in various countries, there are different views on the invitation. Germany's intention is that, at a time when discussions on the German-Austrian tax agreement are in full swing, Britain has neither expressed fierce opposition nor taken this action of inviting a meeting, which is diplomatically beneficial and harmless. Therefore, there is unanimous and enthusiastic welcome from all parties in the country. The Berlin Daily even considers it a sign of Anglo-German cooperation after the European War. Its approval of this move is conceivable.</p>
<p>Since the European War, the international union has had almost a fixed pattern, but only a few victorious powers have distributed it to each other, and the rest of the countries have obeyed their orders. There is no so-called diplomacy, let alone the strategy of vertical and horizontal integration. Since last year, Germany has gradually shown its prominence in the League of Nations and won the reputation of various countries. Until recently, there has been the development of the German-Austrian tax agreement, which has opened up a new situation in the stagnant international situation. Now, there is also the informal gathering between Britain and Germany. The diplomatic situation in Europe may change because of this. It is appropriate for various countries to pay serious attention to it.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 7th According to a telegram from Lisbon, four Portuguese battalions, carrying war equipment and aircraft, have set out for Madeira Island. Colonel Borges has been appointed as the pacification commissioner.</p>
<p>National, Madrid, 8th Portuguese authorities are censoring mail and telegrams. Hence news that has reached the border cannot be verified. It is claimed that the Portuguese government is continuing to send troops to Funchal to quell the unrest. The contingent includes two battalions of infantry, one battalion of artillery, and one machine-gun battalion. They will be protected ashore by two cruisers and four naval aircraft previously deployed. It is apparent that the present troops on the island have acted in unison. Their objective is not to separate from Portugal, but to obtain autonomy. They will comply only with those Portuguese government orders that are constitutional.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Anglo-German Conference in London <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>A Preliminary Indication of Cooperation between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Date Still to be Agreed</p>
<p>France and Italy Invited to Participate Simultaneously</p>
<p>Briand Did Not Clearly Refuse</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 7th The proposed conference between British Foreign Secretary Henderson and German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius in London is still a matter of general discussion. According to reliable sources, the British Foreign Secretary discussed the matter with French Foreign Minister Briand several weeks ago. Briand did not reject it, but has not yet replied, as he wishes to base his response on the needs of domestic policy. It is expected that other countries, especially Italy, will be invited to send representatives to the conference.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 8th The date on which the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister will travel to England has not yet been agreed between the British and German governments. The proposed dates of May 1st and 8th are both problematic. The British government has suggested postponing it until the end of May, but the German side does not agree and wishes to meet before the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council. Therefore, the two sides are still discussing the date.</p>
<p>National, Paris, 7th The British government's invitation to politicians from France, Italy, and Germany to hold an informal gathering in London dates back to mid-February. This has now been confirmed by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through a semi-official French news agency. However, Briand did not immediately reject the invitation at the time, and has not yet replied. He has only stated that his ability to meet with British and German politicians at the villa of British Prime Minister Jixiers will depend on the progress of the drafting of the Naval Agreement. As for the Italian side, Prime Minister Mussolini may not be able to go to England, but Foreign Minister Grandi may go on his behalf. It has also been said that one of the main reasons for the French Foreign Minister's unwillingness to go to England is that Britain has long held sway in European diplomatic affairs. If he were to acquiesce to this situation, it would further increase Britain's prestige, which in the eyes of the French would inevitably have an impact on Briand's position.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 7th German newspapers, regardless of their political affiliation, have expressed extreme pleasure at Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius accepting the British invitation. Although the British invitation was issued before the publication of the German-Austrian customs union, this kind of private gathering is even more important now than before, because the German-Austrian customs union issue is bound to take up an important part of the talks. The disarmament issue, reparations issues, and the Russian issue may be secondary. The Berlin Daily believes that the British government's invitation is an indication of the British willingness to join hands with the Germans again, while the German World News says that Brüning has always been unwilling to participate in diplomatic affairs. The fact that he has now given his approval to go to England must mean that he has a plan in mind to deal with the various problems in a spirit of friendship, in order to save Germany from its predicament and seek the common good. As for the various concerns of the British about the German-Austrian customs union, it will not be difficult to dispel them with this trip. The sincerity of the British politicians in initiating this move is highly admirable.</p>

<p>National, Geneva, 7th German Foreign Minister Curtius has sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, requesting that the current state of military equipment of the countries participating in next year's international disarmament conference be published. The letter has now been published, stating that the League of Nations Council, at its meeting in January, instructed Mr. de Romens to compile a report on the state of military equipment of various countries. Germany is of the opinion that it is impossible to publish a complete report without submitting the same set of questions to the governments of the countries concerned for answers, because it is not possible to compare the military equipment of various countries without using this method. The drafting of the questions to be asked should be included on the agenda of the Council meeting in May.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Fate of the Hamaguchi Cabinet <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Only a Matter of Time</p>
<p>Wakatsuki, Advisor, Rushes Back to Beijing</p>
<p>Internal Strife within the Party Still Fierce</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th The various internal strifes within the party, which have arisen because of Prime Minister Hamaguchi's readmission to the hospital, are becoming increasingly complex, and the political atmosphere is grim. Foreign Minister Shidehara, Ekida and others are determined to restrain Prime Minister Hamaguchi's decision to resign, maintain the status quo, and manage government affairs, while so-called pure rationalists such as Interior Minister Adachi, Colonial Minister Matsuda, and Minister of Communications Koizumi believe that it is well known that the Prime Minister cannot personally manage government affairs. At a time when voices of criticism against responsible politics are rising, if the status quo is maintained, public sympathy will be lost. As a result, the life-extending cabinet of the Minseito will have no possibility. Therefore, it is advisable to resign in a timely manner. Nakano Seigo and others are acting on this view. It seems that Prime Minister Hamaguchi himself is inclined to resign, but the timing of the resignation will depend on how quickly the government can prepare for its retreat. In short, the fate of the Hamaguchi cabinet is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Japan Union, Tokyo, 8th Wakatsuki, the advisor to the Minseito, who was recuperating in the Izu region, suddenly returned to Beijing last night, attracting attention from all sides. It is reported that although Prime Minister Hamaguchi is improving day by day, key government officials intend to exchange views with Wakatsuki on the political situation.</p>
<p>Another telegram states that from this morning, party executives have been frequently visiting Wakatsuki's residence to inquire about Wakatsuki's intentions. It is heard that when Prime Minister Hamaguchi was readmitted to the hospital, he met with Cabinet members such as Ekida Adachi Shidehara for a long time to discuss what attitude the government and the party should adopt in the event of an unexpected event. It seems that it was decided at that time to seek Wakatsuki's assistance. Therefore, Wakatsuki's actions from now on are worthy of attention, and it seems that Prime Minister Hamaguchi will express a major decision only after the party is united.</p>

Mr. Rampda, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, replied that the meeting of the Karachi All-India Congress had hastily passed a declaration of rights without considering various important interests, which was regrettable. He also said that there are no signs of effective international cooperation to fix the price of gold, so India's best policy at present is to allow the exchange rate to rise and fall on its own.</p>

<p>Reuter, Washington, 7th – Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England, visited U.S. President Hoover at the White House today. Although the content of the meeting was not disclosed, Norman stated to reporters upon leaving that the issue of silver was not mentioned.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 7th – The Governor of the Bank of England, Norman, spoke to leading figures in the American financial community today. According to the New York Times, Norman advocated that leaders of the U.S. Federal Reserve and European central banks should meet regularly. Although these meetings would not have binding effect, Norman cautioned that if American officials completely disregarded the situation in foreign countries, it would be shortsighted policy. Present at the meeting were Treasury Secretary Mellon and Federal Reserve Governor Meyer, among others. It is understood that the topics discussed were of a routine nature, involving international trade and finance. Reuters, Paris, 8th – A certain newspaper is paying close attention to Norman's activities in America, claiming that the main purpose of the Governor of the Bank of England's trip is to maintain the superior position of the London market in dominating international lending, and to seek British participation in the creation of an international banking consortium. It further stated that France still advocates that Britain and France should cooperate with each other on international financial issues based on shared interests, but France is not willing to undertake any attempt that would allow the consortium to dispose of France's cash without offering commercial benefits in return.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Reno, 7th – U.S. Senator Oddie declared today that his plan to travel to the Far East for investigation is ready. He will stay in China for two months to investigate the impact of the drastic fall in silver prices and collect opinions from Chinese experts on the silver market. The main purpose of this trip is to determine whether the United States can loan silver to China for currency reform purposes. Oddie is a Republican from Nevada, a state known for silver production. Therefore, Oddie and Pittman, a Democrat from the same state, are both paying close attention to stabilizing silver prices. They are the strongest advocates in the Senate for lending silver to China, to open up an outlet for silver mining and reduce stockpiles of silver.</p>

<p>Changsha Correspondence: The issue of Peng Dehuai and Huang Gonglue's defection has been brewing for months and is now being conducted openly. The outcome is highly anticipated by the people of the country. Huang Hanxiang, who is specifically responsible for negotiating this matter, arrived in the province from Pingxiang, Jiangxi, on the 4th to meet with He Jian and reported that this trip has achieved considerable progress. He stated that an agreement has been fully reached with Huang Gonglue's side, while Peng Dehuai's side still has some discussions regarding future guarantees, but they are also likely to comply. Both Peng and Huang's troops are concentrated in Tengtian awaiting negotiations. However, He Jian intends that Peng and Huang must first demonstrate factual actions by cooperating with the National Army to suppress Zhu and Mao, thereby atoning for their sins, then everything will be easy to negotiate. It is heard that Huang Hanxiang will travel to Ji'an again after reaching an agreement with He Jian in the province. (April 5th)</p>
<p>Red Bandit Division Commander</p>
<h3 id="e77">Liu Hongling Executed in Changsha <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Liu Hongling, commander of the Red Bandit’s pseudo-Independent 3rd Division, was captured by Zhang Kongyi’s regiment of Zhong Brigade of the 31st Division in Chaling. After being escorted to the province for interrogation, He Jian personally interrogated him at the Rural Pacification Headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 2nd. He wanted to obtain information about the Red Bandits' recent plans for the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. Liu firmly refused to reveal anything, but asked to be executed quickly. When questioned further, he broke into insults. The people of Chaling, Youxian, Anren, and Lingxian counties, having suffered repeatedly from Liu's bandits, requested immediate execution to satisfy public anger. He then ordered that Liu be bound and executed at Shiziling outside Liuyangmen at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. His head was placed in a wooden cage and displayed at Simenkou in Changsha for three days, then sent to Chaling for display. A letter was sent to the provincial government to award the meritorious officers and soldiers handsomely. The indictment issued by the Rural Pacification Headquarters is recorded below: Case Investigation: The case of the 31st New Infantry Division escorting the captured Red Bandit pseudo-Division Commander Liu Hongling has been clarified by the Headquarters after repeated interrogation. The criminal is from Chaling and served as the chairman of the Township Peasant Association in the county before Ma Ri. He harassed Liu Shengting's family and brutally killed his son. Ma Ri later fled due to being wanted. Last year, he received a pseudo-appointment from the Red Bandits to organize Soviet governments in various townships and was subsequently promoted to commander of the pseudo-Red Guard Independent 3rd Division. He colluded with Liu Peiran, commander of the Jiangxi Bandit Independent Division, to repeatedly harass Chaling, Youxian, Anren, and Lingxian counties, implementing burning and killing, causing deep suffering to the local area. During the last month of this year, the 1st Brigade of the 31st Division fought bravely in suppressing bandits in Chaling Yaoshui Liuwang and other places, capturing many. The criminal was captured alive, and Soviet government seals, flags, and other items were seized, and they were forwarded to the Division and then to the Headquarters. All criminal details have been confirmed by telegrams from the county party headquarters and various public legal groups, and the criminal has confessed without denial. Such a person, serving in a pseudo-position and disrupting society, is extremely heinous and unforgivable. He should be sentenced to death according to the law. The offender, Liu Hongling, should be brought from prison to verify his identity, bound and sent to the execution ground to be beheaded as a warning. The charges are announced to inform the public.</p>

<p>Killing Over a Thousand Bandits</p>
<p>Destroying Over Twenty Red Army Institutions</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since Chief He issued the general attack order, all armies have made progress. According to a certain committee member of the provincial government, Chief He plans to recover bandit areas such as Guangchang, Ruijin, Huichang, Shicheng, and Xunwu counties by the end of April. Before the National Assembly, he will eliminate Zhu, Mao, Fang, Li, and other bandit gangs. In recent days, battles have been extremely fierce in the areas of Yongfeng, Ji'an, Le'an, Nanfeng, Xingguo, Yudu, Wan'an, Anfu, and Tongwan. The bandit Li Mingrui attempted to attack Ji'an from Yongxin, but was defeated by Luo Lin of the 77th Division in Yongyang, killing over a thousand bandits. The remaining bandits fled to Yongxin through Hechuan. Luo sent a short telegram to Chief He yesterday, reporting on the battle: "According to reports from Brigade Commander Hu Liangyu, (1) After our brigade recovered the entire city of Ruyang, we led the entire brigade to suppress bandits step by step in extremely dangerous places such as Danjiang, Wunhu, Shuiyuan, and Meihua. Along the way, the Red Bandits constructed fortifications, stubbornly resisting. We repeatedly ordered each regiment to search and advance step by step. Before reaching Shuiyuan, over forty bandits were killed, and many bandit supplies were seized. We destroyed Red Army schools, red hospitals, and various levels of pseudo-governments, totaling over twenty. We also distributed the bandit area's rice and foreign goods to the local people. (2) Jiang reported that a captured bandit scout confessed that the pseudo-commander Li Mingrui led the pseudo-7th Army, the Xiangdong Independent Division, and two battalions of pseudo-Yongxin and Ji'an district guards, attempting to attack Ji'an from Tianhe and Zaoheshi, first attacking Yongyang and other places. At dawn, the bandits attacked from all sides, directly衝ing towards Yongshi. We disregarded everything and engaged in fierce combat with our main force. We ordered Chen Bingrong's regiment to deploy on the western end of Rushi to迎撃, and Chen Youpeng's regiment to抄 the bandit's flank from the right wing. The officers and soldiers were exceptionally brave, engaging in fierce combat for seven hours, with dozens of melee battles. Regiment Commander Chen Youpeng was particularly diligent. Because the bandits' main force was defeated, they溃竄 towards Tianhe and Yongxin. In this battle, over two hundred rifles were captured, over a thousand bandits were killed, and the heads of pseudo-regiment and battalion commanders Li Xiaoqing and Jiang Fusheng were captured. Over a dozen Red Army company and platoon leaders were killed. Over a hundred officers and soldiers of our brigade were wounded." (April 7th)</p>

<p>Internal Split Among Local Red Bandits in Western Fujian</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Red bandits on the Jiangxi border entered Chong'an and Jianning counties in Fujian Province a month ago, and were driven back by the brigades of Lin Bingzhou, Qian Yuguang, Liu Shangzhi, and Zhou Zhiqun. The remaining Red bandits in Jiangxi Province, due to Chiang Kwang-nai's troops advancing to Xingguo, have retreated from Guangchang and Ningdu to Shicheng and Ruijin. Shicheng and Ruijin counties are connected to Ninghua and Changting in Fujian Province, only forty or fifty li apart. Therefore, defenses are quite tight. At the same time, scattered Red bandits have also invaded Jianning and Chong'an. Although the garrison troops have dispatched teams to suppress them, they have not been completely eliminated. The provincial government has been receiving telegrams from the county magistrates of Ningchang, Chongjian, and other counties for reinforcements. The brigades of Lin, Qian, Zhou, and Lu have also telegraphed requesting ammunition. The provincial government is coordinating solutions.</p>
<p>Director He Yingqin recently, fearing that the Red bandits would flee into Fujian Province as the bandit suppression troops in Jiangxi Province have all been assigned locations to begin a general offensive, specially dispatched Counselor Xu Xilin to Fujian to visit Yang Shuzhuang and discuss preparations for intercepting and suppressing the bandits with the troops in Fujian. It is heard that Commander He intends to have Liu Heding, Zhang Zhen, Zhou Zhiqun, and Lu Xingbang's two divisions and two brigades of troops guard the counties along the Jiangxi border, and迎頭痛撃 the Red bandits when they invade, preventing them from entering Fujian Province, so that the Jiangxi army can encircle and suppress them. Yang Shuzai pointed out that the troops on the Fujian border are severely lacking in pay and ammunition, especially the brigades of Lu and Zhou, which are facing the greatest difficulties. He requested that Director He negotiate with the headquarters for assistance and also telegraphed each army to comply with orders and deploy defenses.</p>
<p>The local Red bandits in Longyan, Yongding, Shanghang, and Pinghe counties in western Fujian have had their key passes recovered by the army over the past month, and more than half of the bandit population has been溃散. Internal divisions have occurred. It is heard that Chuan Bocui, the most senior figure among the western Fujian Red bandits from the Cancellation faction, believes that the failure was due to the improper command of the pseudo-Western Fujian Military Commission and has expressed resentment. The central faction figures of the pseudo-Military Commission, Zuo Quan, Ruan Shan, and others, also suspected that Chuan was planning a mutiny and ordered the confiscation of his weapons. Chuan then changed the banner to the Social Democratic Party and resisted the orders of the pseudo-Military Commission. The two sides then fought each other in Jiaoyang Nanyang between Shanghang and Yongding. It is heard that they are still slaughtering each other. (April 5th)</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: The 3rd Route Commander Han Fuju commanded the suppression of bandits in Feixian and achieved successive victories. According to the route headquarters, Han's special train arrived in Tai'an at 5:40 PM today (the 6th). He will return to Jinan tonight or tomorrow morning. The bandits in Baodugang and Mengshan have been largely defeated. The official telegrams from Han on the 3rd and 4th are recorded below: (Jiang Telegram) To Chief of Staff Li Youchen, Secretary-General Zhang Ziren: Nu Mi, Announcement, (1) Today, Division Commander Gu led his troops to occupy the line of Zhangzhuang, Woluo, Kuzi, and Chaoyangqian. Brigade Commander Tang led his troops to occupy the line of Niulan, Zijin Pass, and Shangaoyu. Zhao Brigade has occupied the area of Budaigou, Aoxinjue, Shuilongdong, and Wuliangdian. We are now ordering Ma Brigade and □□ (code unclear) and other units to thoroughly search for hidden bandits and扫荡 caves in the valley. However, the wilderness is covered with grass that reaches the top of the head. We have ordered that fires be set to绝根株. (2) Many bandits in Mengshan have been killed, and the area should be cleared within days. We are now preparing to encircle and suppress Baodugang. (3) Your brother Jiang has not yet arrived in Feixian to inspect politics. He has been inquiring about the suffering of the people along the way. He plans to return to Pingyi on a special day. Brother Han Fuju Jiang Xu Seal, (Branch Telegram) Announcement (1) Officers and soldiers have been bravely searching and suppressing bandits in the past two days, killing many.

Six or seven soldiers were slightly injured. (3) Division Commander Gu killed over twenty bandits and rescued over ten male and female hostages. Brigade Commander Tang killed over thirty bandits and rescued over ten male hostages. (4) We are urging inquiries about the situation of Zhao Brigade's suppression today. (5) Your brother left Fei at noon and returned to Pingyi. He will arrive 微已可. Brother Han Fuju Zhi Xu Seal,</p>
<p>Jinan Continued Correspondence: Han Fuju returned from Feixian to Pingyi on the 5th and passed through Sishui to Qufu on the morning of the 6th. At 3:00 PM, he took a special train from Qufu back north and arrived in Tai'an to meet with the 15th Route Commander Ma Hongkui. Because the locomotive of the special train he was on was damaged, Ma Hongkui dispatched another locomotive to tow it. He arrived in Jinan at 8:05 PM that evening. Among those welcoming him at the station were Jiang Bocheng, Zhang Weicun, Zhang Hongjian, Wang Fangting, Wang Xiangrong, Li Shuchun, Zhang Yue, and Zhang Honglie. After Han got off the train, he exchanged greetings with the welcomers and then went to the first-class waiting room. Han spoke about the bandit suppression and the inspection of party affairs and government affairs, stating that the bandits in southern Shandong can be divided into two groups: one group is the Mengshan bandits, and the other group is the Baodu bandits. The Mengshan bandits have been痛勦 by our army, killing over a hundred. Many also died falling down the mountain. The rest have all fled and have been captured by our Ma Brigade, totaling over a hundred, and have been largely eliminated. Currently, only small remnants remain near Mengshan. We have ordered each army to eliminate them within three days, and then transfer the troops to the roads of Sishui Feixian to進勦 the Baodu bandits. The bandit suppression in southern Shandong can be said to be four-tenths completed, with six-tenths remaining. Because the election period for the National Assembly is approaching, Fuju has taken time to return to Jinan for a look. He plans to return to the front on the day after tomorrow (the 8th). As for the political aspect, the atmosphere in Feixian is closed off to the extreme. The former president of the Sishui court was really too bad, daring to openly bribe. The prison guards and police officers have been detained. Feixian probably has no construction to speak of because it is too far from the railway. The city has been attacked twice by bandits. Fortified towers have been built in the city. The villages near Mengshan have all been burned by bandits. Therefore, the army has nowhere to purchase supplies when suppressing bandits. As for the mountainside of Baodu, there are no bandits. The roots of the mountains in the area of Zaoxhuang between Lincheng and Tengxian are where bandits gather. Because there is no water on the mountain, and one cannot climb the mountain without a rope, the bandit problem in southern Shandong can be said to be extreme. If they are not cleared, the people may have no survivors. The villages and fortresses are all firmly closed, and the defense is extremely strict. Those who approach the village gates are threatened with guns. It is planned to add民團 and send them to southern Shandong to assist in bandit suppression. Near Mengshan, there is land that no one dares to cultivate. Many people are通匪, mutually accusing each other. It is impossible to tell who is 通匪 and who is not. Therefore, except for the few people who were shot in Feixian, those who filed bandit lawsuits were not dealt with. Finally, Han talked about the traffic conditions in Sishui, saying that one can take a car from Da Bian Bridge to Qufu. East of Da Bian Bridge to Feixian, there are only two sections of stone road. If one wants to通汽車, one must build bridges. There is also a road from Da Bian Bridge to Boshan that can通汽車. Mengyin produces 金花 and peanuts, but because of the large number of bandits, people dare not plant them. Along the main road, many villages and fortresses have not been broken by bandits. Sishui was also besieged once by bandits. There were about a thousand bandits from Mengshan who绑大批 肉票. This time, hundreds of 肉票 were打落. The situation in southern Shandong is roughly like this, etc. At this point, Han and other dignitaries left the station and went to the provincial government to rest by car.</p>

<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The Jin Province Financial Reorganization Design Committee held its inaugural meeting in the Provincial Government Conference Hall at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 3rd). Attendees included Provincial Government Chairman Shang Zhen, Provincial Government Committee Members Qiu Zengyi, Chang Bingyi, Feng Sizhi, Li Shangren, Guo Baoqing, Provincial Party Headquarters Representative Liu Huaiqi, 6th Army Commander Yang Aiyuan, 5th Army Chief of Staff Yang Fenglin, Results Office Military Supplies Group Leader Guo Dianping, Financial Reorganization Office Representative Yang Peiqiao, Chamber of Commerce Representative Wang Zhaotai, Money Industry Guild Representatives Hao Qingzhao and Duan Guozhen, Education Association Representative Yang Renkang, Provincial Bank Representatives Yan Yuqin, Li Buqing, Chang Yunwen, and specially appointed Committee Member Gao Hong, totaling nineteen people. Chairman Shang Zhen conducted the ceremony as usual. The chairman reported that recently the price of provincial currency has plummeted, rumors have arisen, prices have increased, and the people's lives have become increasingly difficult, especially for the working class. Military expenses have not yet been settled, and demobilization funds have not yet been allocated. Fearing social unrest due to popular sentiment, the reorganization of finance is the most urgent and pressing matter. The provincial government has an unshirkable responsibility for the reorganization of finance, but due to the magnitude of the matter and the urgency of the situation, it cannot be handled well without collective wisdom and effort. Therefore, I proposed at the provincial government meeting to establish a Financial Reorganization Design Committee, which was resolved to be organized by the provincial party headquarters, provincial government, army commanders, results office military supplies group, financial reorganization office, chamber of commerce, money industry guild, education association, farmers association, provincial bank, and financial experts. Ten measures were also passed, scheduled to take effect today. Hereafter, meetings will be held every Thursday morning. Temporary meetings may be held in the event of special financial incidents. This is the origin of the organization of this committee. Furthermore, the provincial government has long been paying attention to the reorganization of finance. The financial reorganization proposal was put forward for discussion at the first meeting. A resolution was passed to telegraph the central government, approving the restoration of financial public bonds. The central government has now submitted it to the Executive Yuan for review. The second temporary meeting of the Provincial Committee also resolved to telegraph the central government, urging prompt approval, and to telegraph Deputy Commander Zhang, urging the prompt allocation of demobilization funds and urging the central government to quickly approve the financial public bond measures. We have received a telegram from Deputy Commander Zhang, stating that the demobilization funds have been ordered to be remitted immediately, and the telegram urging the central government to approve the restoration of financial public bonds has also been sent on his behalf. However, whether the central government will approve the restoration of financial public bonds cannot be predicted. We must seek our own methods of relief and never sit idly by as finance collapses and society falls into chaos. From this point of view, this committee is even more necessary.

<h3 id="e82">Wu Tiecheng's Talk in Harbin <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Inspects for Three Days Before Going to Heilongjiang</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Wu Tiecheng, who is inspecting party affairs in the Northeast, arrived in Harbin from Jilin at 8:00 AM on April 1st. He plans to stay in Harbin for three days and go to Heilongjiang on the afternoon of the 7th. He also plans to stay in Heilongjiang for three days before returning to Liaoning, passing through Pingjin, and is scheduled to return to Beijing in late April. When Wu arrived in Harbin, leaders from all walks of life and key figures from various agencies went to the station to welcome him, making the situation very warm. Wu is currently staying at the headquarters of the Railway Protection Army Commander-in-Chief on Da Zhijie in Qinjiagang. Many dignitaries have been visiting him. On the same day, Wu spoke with reporters as follows: (Question) After the Northeast party affairs are made public, are there any diplomatic issues? (Answer) No problem. Chinese people run the Chinese party, and foreigners have no right to interfere. However, foreigners are unwilling and indeed very afraid of the establishment of party affairs. (Question) After the Harbin Municipal Party Headquarters is established, do Chinese employees of the East China Railway have to join the party? Because the East China Railway has diplomatic relations, the Soviet Union pays close attention to whether Chinese employees join the party. (Answer) This should be allowed to happen naturally, and there will be no coercion. However, we hope they will join the party. (Question) If Chinese employees of the East China Railway join the party, will they form another party headquarters? (Answer) It will also be managed by the local party headquarters and no separate party headquarters will be established. (Question) What are your opinions on Northeast party affairs? (Answer) I hope that each party headquarters will work hard in accordance with the two points of culture and propaganda. In addition, we will carry out seven tasks: afforestation, road construction, sanitation保甲, promotion of national goods. Because culture can improve the people's level, propaganda can make people aware of our party. Other general tasks, each party headquarters must implement. (Question) Will the central government send personnel to help the Northeast organize the party? (Answer) The central government will let the local government handle the Northeast party affairs and will not interfere, but hopes to proceed in accordance with the central government's guidelines. (Question) There are only three party members of the local committee in Harbin. Can the party headquarters be established? (Answer) It remains to be discussed and decided. I hope to see it accomplished before I leave Harbin. (Question) What are the measures for the masses to join the party? (Answer) For those who have not joined the party, a period of one year is set to prepare for party membership. (Question) What about officials? (Answer) Civil officials at the section chief level and military officers at the major level or above must join the party, but it is not certain, etc.</p>
<p>Wu is scheduled to give a public lecture on party affairs at the Wai Daoli Church at 4:00 PM on the 5th at the invitation of various groups. When the Harbin Municipal Party Headquarters is formally established within the Special Zone Administrative Office, a suitable location will be sought. Also, Party Committee Member Zou Shangyou has gone to Tianjin with Tianjin Mayor Zhang Xueming. It is heard that the vacant seat still needs to be filled by the central government. (April 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Zhejiang Province Sends Personnel to Investigate Mineral Resources <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province's mineral products are numerous and diverse. Previously, the Mineral Resources Survey Office of the Construction Department investigated and found that there are more than twenty kinds of metals and non-metals, totaling more than two hundred locations. These include the gold mine in Kaihua, the lead and silver mines in Zhuji and Fuyang, the tin mines in Qingtian and Yongjia, the iron ore in Zhuji and Yuhang, and the iron ore in Changxing, Jiande, and Ninghai. Tin ore is mostly found in the upper reaches of the Xin'an River, and tin is mostly found in the Oujiang River basin. Non-metals such as coal and fluorite are the most common mineral products in Zhejiang Province. Coal is produced in the counties in the upper reaches of the Qujiang River, and there are also many coalfields in Changxing and Wuxing on the border of Anhui and Zhejiang. Fluorite mines are scattered like stars east of the Qiantang River and west of Mount Tiantai, numbering about fifty. Other minerals such as alum stone in Pingyang, agalmatolite in Qingtian and Songyang, and mica in Xiangshan are also very abundant. Currently, the office plans to send personnel to organize investigation teams to survey five areas in the province that have not been investigated but are considered to warrant further exploration. The first area is along the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, the second area is the Lingjiang River basin, the third area is the Oujiang River basin, the fourth area is the Feiyun River basin and coastal areas, and the fifth area is Wuxing, Changxing, and other counties. However, the survey routes in each area vary in length, and the survey period depends on the time required for the work, with the longest being three to five months and the shortest being about one month.</p>

<p>The election of representatives to the National Assembly in Wuhu County has commenced today for the party departments and district branches. Voting is scheduled to be completed before the 9th. The County Party Department held a special meeting yesterday to resolve to appoint Zhang Shuye, Li Tangbi, Geng Xidao, Gu Wuwei, Chen Zuoshan, Pan Yunkun, Huang Shuhan, Huang Huaili, Qi Yigan, and Wu Jixin, a total of ten people, as election supervisors in various districts for the National Assembly election.</p>
<p>According to a secret report, a Communist Party organization is operating in Wuhu, hiding important Communist Party members. Yesterday, the provincial authorities specially dispatched Zhang to Wuhu to work with the Public Security Bureau to select police officers to arrest nine suspects last night, including a woman surnamed Du. Four people have already been sent to the province today.</p>
<p>During the military period, when the army passed through Wuhu, a military reception center was jointly established by the Public Security Bureau, the County Government, and the General Chamber of Commerce to facilitate hospitality. Recently, the County Chamber of Commerce was reorganized. Due to the high costs of the center, in addition to collecting an additional 6,200 yuan from land taxes, the General Chamber of Commerce has contributed more than 17,200 yuan. It is difficult to maintain this in the long run. It was proposed to close the center immediately, but Magistrate Yu was concerned that Wuhu Port was a vital waterway and that the center should not be closed until the military situation was resolved. In addition to petitioning the Finance Department to approve the continued collection of a one-cent per mu donation, he also ordered the County Chamber of Commerce to continue operating the center.</p>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department instructed the Wuhu County Government to prepare for the establishment of the Wuhu Relief Home. Magistrate Yu, after receiving the order, immediately appointed Wu Xingzhou, chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, to concurrently serve as the president of the home, and Tao Yutang as the vice president, and began preparations.

<p>List of Agricultural and Educational Association Members Submitted to Province for Review: The County Election Supervisor, Jin Qingzhang, telegraphed various educational and agricultural associations on the 6th, stating that the County Reorganization Committee's letter had been approved. The Provincial Reorganization Committee instructed that the lists of participants in the county agricultural associations' elections should be based on the lists of representatives of the established township agricultural associations. The educational associations could also submit the lists of members of the established district educational associations. All submissions were to be sent to the province by April 8th. The Provincial General Supervisor, Yu, also telegraphed, instructing that all established district agricultural associations in the county should participate in the election. It was noted that the election of national representatives should be conducted in accordance with Article 7 of the Election Implementation Law. Due to the tight deadline, preparations might not be completed in time. After discussing with Standing Committee member Wang, it was decided that the County Party Reorganization Committee would provide written proof of the establishment of the district agricultural and educational associations, and the County Government would organize the previously submitted lists of associations, or rewrite the lists, and submit them together first. This was an expedient measure, and it was difficult to predict whether the province would recognize it as valid. It was reported that the lists of the educational associations of the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts, and the district agricultural associations of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth districts, were sent to the Provincial Election General Office in Zhenjiang by Commissioner Liu Nailai by train on the evening of the 7th for review.</p>

<p>Young Man and Woman Commit Suicide by Poisoning Simultaneously: A sensational case of double suicide occurred at the Dadong Inn outside Suzhou. Both the man and woman are dead. On the 5th, a male and female traveler arrived at the inn and stayed in room 138 on the third floor. Both spoke with a Yangzhou accent. The woman was beautiful, and the man was also well-dressed. The man claimed to be Shuang Dewei, 30 years old, from Shanghai academia. On the 6th, they moved to room 93 downstairs because they felt the third floor was noisy. Before going to bed, they instructed the tea room to not wake them up early the next day. At 5 p.m. on the 7th, the tea room pushed open the door to check and found that both had taken poison and were dying and unable to speak. The two were lying side by side. The man stretched out his left arm and pillowed the woman's neck, and stretched his right foot over the woman's body. The inn hired Dr. Gu Suyu from Western medicine to examine them, but it was too late. They died shortly after. Yesterday morning (8th), the local court sent prosecutor Lai Gan to investigate. The man was wearing a gray cotton-padded jacket and pants, lined with a velvet shirt and a velvet cloth shirt. Besides a handkerchief, there was nothing else on him. The woman was wearing a gray woolen cheongsam with black trim, a pink cotton-padded jacket, jade-colored embroidered socks, and patent leather shoes. She had a gold chain around her neck with a gold medallion from the Tianbao Silver Shop in Hangzhou, three gold buttons, a Parker fountain pen, a gold watch on her left hand, a double-strand gold bracelet, and two jade rings on her fingers. There was a stamp box on the table in front of the bed, as well as 45 yuan in banknotes, two small foreign coins, and two white tin-packaged cigarettes. It was determined that both had died from poisoning and there was a suicide note, which roughly said: "We are committing suicide because we both have incurable diseases. There is no other reason, and it has nothing to do with this inn. We still have 45 yuan in banknotes, a gold bracelet, two gold rings, a fountain pen, a watch, two quilts, and some clothes. If a kind person would use the remaining money to arrange a thin coffin for burial, we would be very grateful."</p>

<p>Small Steamboat and Tugboat Nearly Sink: The Hengyu small steamboat of the China Steamship Company runs daily from Wuxi to Zhou Tieqiao, Yixing, and its business is very good. The morning before yesterday, the steamboat was towing a tugboat carrying seventy or eighty passengers when it departed from Wuxi. After 11 o'clock, when passing the Qianqiao Town pier, more than ten miles away from the city, it was about to dock when the Heqiao steamboat of the Zhixing Company came from the countryside to the city. As the two ships gave way to each other, the China tugboat suddenly hit a reef and the hull sank. The male and female passengers were all terrified, grabbing things and making an enormous mess. The sound of crying could be heard from far and wide. Fortunately, the tugboat had gradually approached the shore at this time, and the passengers were able to get ashore without drowning. However, all the luggage was submerged in the water, resulting in irreparable losses. The Rape of Maidservant Case Has Been Judged: Hu Nianzu, a male servant of Zhou Zhaofu, a wealthy merchant in Zhouxin Town in the third district of the county, raped a maidservant, Juxiang, who was under the age of sixteen. Zhou sent a representative, Lu Shilun, to report to the county court, and after repeated interrogations, Hu was detained. The prosecutor's office concluded its investigation the other day and filed a public prosecution with the same-level criminal court. The court president Yang held a trial and appointed lawyer Tang Ying as the pro bono defense attorney. The result of the trial was that Hu Nianzu was ordered to be returned to custody, and Juxiang was ordered to return home. Yesterday was the day for the verdict in this case. Judge Jin signed and brought Hu Nianzu to the court and sentenced him to three years and six months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Outbreak of Meningitis Spreads in Urban and Rural Areas: The weather in the county has been unfavorable recently, causing widespread outbreaks of smallpox, measles, colds, and other illnesses, which have persisted for a long time. In addition, there is also meningitis. The hospitals in the urban area are receiving patients for treatment every day, and the situation is even more severe in rural areas. In the fifth district of the county, in the area around Gu Ting Temple in Maqi Township, there are many patients and deaths are occurring one after another. According to doctors, this dangerous illness will disappear as soon as the weather warms up.</p>
<p>The Strange Case of Beating a Model Cleared Up: Sun Shuruo, a resident of Nanjing Bridge in the city, bought a Henan girl named Xiaoqing as a maidservant in 1920. The girl is now of marriageable age and has a pleasing appearance. Therefore, Sun and his wife, Bao, loved and cherished her very much, treating her like their own daughter. On the 1st of this month, Xiaoqing suddenly contracted meningitis. Despite repeated medical treatments and visits to Puren Hospital, she eventually died due to the severity of the illness. Sun Shuruo then bought a coffin and temporarily placed it in the mulberry field in the backyard. However, on the 6th, the Dao Bao newspaper suddenly published a news item titled "Beating a Model," with the sub-headline "A Beautiful Maidservant Is Often Whipped, Covered in Wounds, and Inevitably Dies." It stated that "Sun Xiaoqing, the maidservant of the Sun family, was whipped dozens of times by Sun's wife, Bao, causing her to be seriously injured and unable to get out of bed, and she died on the second day." After seeing the report, Zhou Erkai, the chief prosecutor of the county court, immediately filed a case according to law because it concerned human life, and summoned the Sun couple to the court for investigation. After questioning them, he could not find any clues, so he summoned Wang Yongtai, the head of the Tu Tu, for questioning. Wang forcefully claimed that Xiaoqing had died of illness and that there was no abuse. Chief Prosecutor Zhou was afraid that there were other circumstances, so he immediately took the coroner, the clerk, and the bailiffs and accompanied Sun Shuruo to the graveyard to open the coffin for examination. Sun Shuruo then requested to be exempted from the examination and said that if the examination revealed any wounds, he would be willing to accept punishment, and if there were no wounds, he must investigate thoroughly. Chief Zhou did not allow it and immediately opened the coffin. After repeated examinations for a long time, there were no wounds on any part of the body. There were only a few blisters on the legs. Chief Prosecutor Zhou verified that there was no mistake and immediately ordered Sun Shuruo to re-coffin and return to the court. The Bao family was released after being brought to court for no reason and suffering this strange injustice, causing the dead to turn over in the coffin. She refused to leave and cried all the way home after being persuaded by others.</p>

<p>Investigate and Deal with Construction Bureau Staff for Embezzling Public Funds: Since the Yangzhong County Construction Bureau was abolished last spring, it was replaced by the Yangzhong County Construction Office, which is concurrently managed by the Zhenjiang County Construction Bureau. The Zhenjiang Bureau sent technician Cui Hualiang to the office to preside over the work. Since Cui arrived in Yangzhong, he has not achieved any results, and the people of Yangzhong have been very critical. Recently, it was suddenly discovered that he had embezzled public funds. The Construction Department sent personnel to verify the situation. The riverbed of the Yangzhong Er Dunzi Port is higher than the embankment. Because the project is large and expensive, it has not been dredged for a long time. Two years ago, Jiang Wanqing donated 3,000 yuan for the port opening. Later, it was found that the money was insufficient. The former County Party Department and local people agreed that Yuan Tong and Yong Tong He, two businesses, would be responsible for safekeeping, and the money could not be withdrawn until construction started. The two businesses made a record and handed it over to the Construction Office to pay interest at a rate of 1.5% per month. When Cui Hualiang, the technician of the office, collected the interest each month, he only wrote "Interest received for the month of [Month]" on the record, without noting the amount. However, when he reported to the Zhenjiang County Construction Bureau, he only reported that the interest was 8%. Director Zhang of the bureau did not investigate because of some connections. Recently, Guo and Wang, two businessmen from Yangzhong Company, reported the matter to the Construction Department. The Construction Department sent Commissioner Yu Zhongju to Yangzhong to check the ledgers of the two merchants and found that the daily interest rate was indeed 1.5%. Over ten months, technician Cui Hualiang had embezzled more than 200 yuan. He was interrogated at the Construction Office. Cui knew that the matter could not be concealed and agreed to return 210 yuan and wrote a receipt. The department commissioner took it to the province. Cui was afraid that the matter was not over, so he tracked to the province and asked Director Zhang of Zhenjiang to find a way to make amends. It is now heard that all the people's organizations in Yangzhong City will report to the provincial department to severely punish Cui for embezzling public funds, as the evidence is conclusive.</p>
<p>Lumber Company Bankrupt Due to Losses: The Fuyuanyuanlai Lumber Company in Dao Shang Miao Town, Yangzhong, was jointly established by E Wannian, Dai Zhonghua, Chen Feng, and others, and has been in operation for more than ten years. Recently, due to incompetent management, it has suffered losses over the years and owes large amounts of money to lumber companies in Shangxinhe, Nanjing, and Changzhou. Recently, Lou Huiwu, manager of Yihesheng in Shangxinhe, Zheng Yujie, manager of Yonghexiang, Lei Zhuqin, manager of Yongxingyu, Huang Jiexu, manager of Huangtiantai, and Liu Rong, manager of Changzhou Yuanfenghang, came to Yangzhong as representatives of the creditors to negotiate. The shareholders of the company are willing to sell the existing lumber, wooden boards, coffins, and real estate in the warehouse, which are estimated to be worth more than 4,000 yuan, to repay the debt. The remaining debt will be borne by the shareholders. Therefore, the company has now declared bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Two Rickshaw Pullers Drown After Falling into Water with Bridge: Yesterday (5th) afternoon at 2 PM, a woman surnamed Liu, who lives in Six Lane in the city, had accompanied her son back to her home province of Ningbo last month for a visit to relatives at a person surnamed Mao's. Yesterday, because they were returning to sweep tombs for Qingming Festival, they returned by rickshaw. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw reached the wooden slope of the first bridge (i.e., Dong Bridge), it was difficult to climb the slope because it was heavily loaded. Another empty rickshaw followed behind, so the rickshaw puller put down his own rickshaw and helped the front rickshaw over the slope, but he used too much force, and the railings on both sides of the bridge had been falling off for a long time. As a result, the female passenger, a child, and two rickshaw pullers, as well as the rickshaw itself, all fell into the water. At that time, there was a bean boat parked under the river. The child fell near the boat and was rescued by the boatman. The female passenger, when she fell into the water, held tightly to the large package of cotton clothes she was carrying, so she did not sink immediately and was also rescued by the bean boat. However, both rickshaw pullers drowned, and their bodies have not yet been recovered.</p>

It was not until dawn that they realized it was a misunderstanding and stopped fighting. Fei Zhiyuan, a platoon leader of the regiment, was killed in action. Company Commander Wang and six soldiers were captured. Several soldiers were also shot and wounded. Pan Brigade also suffered casualties, including a company commander and more than ten soldiers.

<h3 id="e97">No Longer Anchoring in the Center of the Huangpu River <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Customs to Take Over Buoys</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the National Government has reached an agreement with the diplomatic representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Japan that foreign warships will no longer anchor in the center of the Huangpu River. All naval buoys will be handed over to the management of the Customs immediately, and they will no longer have the right to set up fixed anchorages within China's territorial waters. Although Italy does not have naval buoys in the Huangpu River, it is said to have participated in this discussion. In the future, foreign warships coming to Shanghai will anchor between Zhoujiazui and the Huangpu River, or between the buoys of foreign companies, but they must be under the control of the Customs. Therefore, these buoys will also be taken back by the Customs. According to people in the National Government, except for China, no other country currently allows a foreign navy to set up buoys and enjoy fixed anchoring rights in its territorial waters. Moreover, the anchoring of large warships in the center of the Huangpu River obstructs navigation. Therefore, there is a move to take back the naval buoys of various countries. As for naval berths, being farther from the city center should not cause any inconvenience.</p>

<p>Eurasia: Yesterday morning, Mr. He En, a German engineer from Hansa Company, along with pilot Shaq and mechanic Shi Peiling, flew the Eurasia No. 4 airplane from Hongqiao Airport at 9:30 AM for the second test flight to Ping, to inspect the route, set up radio stations in Jinan and Beiping, and test the radio on the airplane. The communication with Shanghai headquarters was excellent. According to the radio report from the airplane to the Shanghai headquarters, it safely arrived in the capital at 11 AM yesterday morning. It will stay for one day and is scheduled to fly from Beijing to Jinan this morning, and from Jinan to Ping tomorrow. It is said that Eurasia Aviation is scheduled to officially open at the end of this month. As for the Chinese pilot Liang Mutang, he did not go north with the plane.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Tram Fares Increase Again <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Starting This Month on the 19th</p>
<p>A General Increase of One Copper Coin</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that according to personnel of the Shanghai Electric Tramways, the tram fares in the Public Concession will increase starting this month on the 19th, in order to make up for the increased expenses due to the decline in silver prices. However, the increase is not much, roughly one copper coin more than the current fare. Previously, the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council had proposed whether it could only increase the first-class fare and not the third-class fare. The company replied, explaining the hardship of having to increase fares, and that the general increase of only one copper coin according to the current fare would have a very small impact on passengers. The board of directors of the previous Municipal Council approved it.</p>

<h3 id="e103">The Issue of Implementing the Factory Law <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Management Association Scheduled to Meet on the 11th</p>
<p>to Discuss</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of postponing the implementation of the Factory Law and revising it, there are a total of seven proposals from various parties. After several discussions by the Industrial and Commercial Management Association, it was deemed that the proposal of the Industrial and Commercial Management Association was the most accurate. However, after being distributed to various manufacturers for study, most opinions still intend to revise it. It is learned that this Saturday, the Industrial and Commercial Management Association plans to gather again for discussion to make a final decision. The reporter also interviewed Mr. Qian Chengxu of the China General Federation of Industry on the issue of implementing the Factory Law in foreign factories in the concession and its relationship with the International Labour Office, and asked about the historical process. He replied that in 1919, when China signed the Treaty of Versailles with Germany and Austria, it became a member of the International Labour Organization. The International Labour Conference held in Washington in 1919, especially the National Committee, discussed labor issues in various Far Eastern countries. Regarding the Chinese part, it was hoped that: (1) The Chinese government would adopt the principle of protecting workers with the Factory Law; (2) It was advocated that the International Labour Conference should negotiate with relevant countries to make them follow the labor laws already established by the Chinese government in their concessions and leased territories in China, and that the Chinese government should implement them in the concessions and leased territories. In March 1923, the Chinese government, based on the proposals of the conference, promulgated the Provisional Factory Regulations, and Article 3 clearly stipulated that all foreign factories within the territory of China should be subject to them. The concession authorities were panicked and repeatedly gathered to discuss the matter, and their opinions on this section were: (1) The concession only adopted a part of the principles of the Factory Regulations and separately formulated the Concession Factory Regulations; (2) Consideration was temporarily postponed until extraterritoriality was abolished; (3) If the Chinese government agreed to accept the opinions of the Child Labour Committee, revised the regulations, and could implement them in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces or only in Jiangsu province, the Concession Municipal Council would find ways to obtain the necessary powers to implement them in the concession. Later, due to the divergence of opinions from various parties, it was suspended indefinitely. In 1918, Albert Thomas, the Director-General of the International Labour Office, came to China for sightseeing, and the Chinese government reiterated the previous proposal. At that time, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had drafted the Factory Law, but Thomas replied that he had not been authorized to do so. In 1929, the International Labour Conference held its twelfth session, and the Chinese government representatives again proposed the "Bill that foreign factories in China should obey the labor laws implemented by the Chinese government." It was rejected due to insufficient votes. The discussant again asked whether the delegation would propose this case at this year's Labour Conference since the delegation had changed its representatives. He replied that the authority was in the government, and the employer representatives could not act alone.</p>

<p>Cigarette Merchants Should Pay Attention to Shipping Goods in a Timely Manner</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry yesterday instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, saying, "Regarding the instruction, recently, according to the report of the Indian Consulate General on the commercial situation in India, the last paragraph briefly states that the commerce of Japan in India has been very developed recently, and its speed of progress is surprising. However, the trade between our country and India has not seen any improvement. As for the goods that Chinese merchants have always handled here, they are only the products needed for daily supply. Recently, due to the Indian boycott of British goods, several overseas Chinese stores have initiated a trial of Chinese-made cigarettes in India. Although these goods are just starting out, the cigarettes that have been transported are quite welcome to the scholars. However, the Shanghai cigarette factory does not deliver the goods in a timely manner, causing the general manager here to have difficulty coping with the shortage of goods. If measures are not taken to supervise them early, there will be a risk of failure. Therefore, it is hereby ordered that the association inform the cigarette factory merchants in the city and urge them to pay close attention to timely delivery to avoid the failure of trade with India." The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has forwarded a letter to the Cigarette Factory Association, urging the cigarette factories to pay attention to timely delivery to avoid the failure of trade with India.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Shipping News <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Shipwrecked Crew Rescued: The Japanese ship Chunqing Maru, 4,900 tons, managed by Yamashita in Shanghai, was coming to Shanghai loaded with wheat from Australia on February 5th. That afternoon at 10:00 PM, the ship encountered fog and ran aground at 113 degrees 40 minutes east longitude and 22 degrees 30 minutes north latitude. After the accident, the Meiho Maru and Changfu Maru went to rescue one after another, but they also ran aground. Afterwards, the Meiho Maru rescued the crew, but the bottom of the Chunqing Maru was flooded and could not be towed. The company then sent the Chunbao Maru to rescue the crew. As of yesterday, the Chunbao Maru had rescued all 42 people, including the captain of the Chunqing Maru, Mr. Iida, and the staff, and they have disembarked at the China Merchants Bureau.</p>
<p>Kuaipi Sent to Rescue: The Shanghai Merchants Bureau's Shangjiang vessel, Kuaipi, ran aground near Shashi. The Hankou Bureau sent the Liji vessel to tow it, and the 48th Division sent a team of soldiers to protect the ship.</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Starts Service to Yantai: There are no Japanese ships operating between Shanghai and Yantai. In order to compete with British ships, Dalian Kisen Kaisha has decided to open a new Shanghai-Yantai route. It has been decided that the first voyage on the Shanghai-Yantai line will be on the 17th of this month, using the Changping and Tianjin ships from the Shanghai-Tianjin line. Recently, the company has begun to solicit goods to Yantai and passengers. British ships are also preparing to compete fiercely with it.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Further News on Japanese Ship Colliding with Jiangyu Ship <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The situation of the Japanese ship Fengpumaru colliding with the Jiangyu ship of the China Merchants Bureau in Anqing was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Liu Yuzhou, the secretary of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial United General Association, reported to the association, requesting that the previous tragedies of Japanese ships sinking the Xinda Ming and Xinkang ships be forwarded to the central government for investigation. The document stated: "After reading today's Shen Bao newspaper, an article on the 'Japanese Ship Fengpumaru Colliding with the Jiangyu Ship,' although fortunately the ship retreated quickly and did not cause the drowning of people, it is clear that in recent years, Japanese ships have been vigorously advancing into our country's inland rivers under the pretext of reciprocal navigation, as if entering an uninhabited area. They run into Chinese ships indiscriminately, causing the tragedies of property and lives of the Xinda Ming and Xinkang ships. At that time, they turned their heads and ignored them, and afterwards, they delayed compensation. This is nothing but the capitalist imperialists of Japan attempting to expand their shipping and deliberately destroying Chinese ships. The intentions of Sima Zhao are obvious. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? In order to avoid the baseless disaster of Chinese ship seamen and to maintain our country's shipping rights and sovereignty, the association should send a telegram to the central government, making a serious protest to Japan, and issue a notice to strictly restrict the import of Japanese ships. If there is any violation, they should be stopped with force. As for the damage to the Jiangyu ship this time and the tragedies of the previous Xinda Ming ships, the Japanese side should be ordered to compensate them in the shortest period of time to quell the atmosphere of violence and warn against future offenders. It is reasonable to report this and enclose a copy of the newspaper for your review and implementation." It is said that the Jiangyu ship has been repaired and has left Jianglong Reef, and it may arrive in port at 9:00 AM today.</p>
<p>Kanmen</p>
<h3 id="e108">Wireless Telegrams Normally Received and Sent <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>It has been found that the telegrams sent by merchants and people from all walks of life in this port to Kanmen have always been transmitted by wireless, which is quite convenient due to its careful handling and rapid transmission. However, since the equipment of the Kanmen station was damaged last month and the communication was suspended for some reason, it has been quite inconvenient for merchants to use telegrams to contact Kanmen. Now, the equipment of the Kanmen station has been repaired, and the communication between Shanghai and Kanmen has been restored since the 4th of this month. It is said that the Shanghai Wireless Telegraph General Receiving and Sending Office of the Ministry of Communications at the east end of the old North Gate on Minguo Road in this port, as well as the receiving and sending offices at No. 7 and a half on the Bund, No. 12 on North Sichuan Road, the Sassoon House on Renji Road, and the Dadongmenwai Dama Tou Street in Nanshi, and the receiving stations in the Shanghai Bank branches at Jing'an Temple Road, Broadway Road, and Avenue Joffre, have all been ordered to receive and send telegrams to Kanmen as usual from today, which is probably also good news for all walks of life in this port.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau previously stated that the central area of the city is the best place in the city and is related to the observation of both Chinese and foreigners. In order to make the houses in the commercial and residential areas that will be built as perfect as possible, it has offered rewards for soliciting standard designs. The newspaper previously had a detailed record of the solicitation method. It is now learned that the bureau's solicitation of designs has been quite enthusiastic among architects at home and abroad. Now, the deadline of April 15th is approaching, and the bureau has repeatedly notified all applicants that there will be no extension to avoid waiting and delaying themselves. It has also started to organize the judging committee.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau previously found it difficult to temporarily look for talent, so it advertised publicly for solicitation. It is now learned that after the advertisement was published, about 450 people went to ask for the registration form for personnel waiting for employment. About 160 people filled out and submitted the form to the bureau. After careful review by the bureau, about 40 people were registered. Those who were registered were notified by the bureau, and as soon as there was a suitable opportunity, they would be invited. There are currently two people on trial, and two people are in contact. However, it is also heard that the bureau's solicitation of talent this time focused on specialized technical aspects, but the results were still mostly administrative talent.</p>

<p>Revised Municipal Bond Overdue Regulations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government previously approved the official letter from the Shanghai Municipal Bond Fund Custody Committee, stating that the lottery drawing dates of the various public bonds issued by the National Government are specified in each set of regulations. However, the revised municipal bond regulations only stipulate the redemption date in Article 8, and the lottery drawing date is not specified. If it is determined on a temporary basis each time, it seems insufficient to show uniformity. It is proposed to predetermine a lottery drawing date within one month before March 31st and September 30th each year. It also seeks guidance on whether the predetermined lottery drawing date should be added to the regulations. The Municipal Government has replied to the committee, stating that the municipal bond regulations have been approved for revision by the government, and it is not necessary to add the lottery drawing date to the regulations again. In the future, the lottery drawing should be held ten days before the redemption date, according to precedent. The original plan for the redemption of Shanghai municipal bonds was 200,000 yuan for each of the first twelve periods, and 300,000 yuan for each of the last two periods. The Municipal Government submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, which was then forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for revision, because the amount did not match the number of lottery tickets. The government has announced the revised regulations. The revised redemption plan is seven lottery tickets for each of the first twelve periods, with each lottery ticket redeeming 33,000 yuan, for a total of 210,000 yuan each. For the last two periods, eight lottery tickets will be drawn each period, and each lottery ticket will redeem 30,000 yuan, for a total of 240,000 yuan each. As for the interest, it was originally 1,188,000 yuan, but according to the revised regulations, only 1,154,400 yuan of interest is required, reducing the interest by 33,600 yuan, which benefits the ticket holders and reduces the burden on the citizens.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the fifth day of the Jiangsu Province Shanghai Fisheries Promotion Association. The number of visitors remained crowded, with even more groups visiting than before. More than ten schools, including Wuben, Aiqun, and Qianghua, led their entire student bodies to visit. Zhang Yunlv of Wuben Girls' School sent a letter requesting the association to send a aquaculture expert to lecture at the school. The association has replied, agreeing to the request. In view of the enthusiastic participation of various groups, the association is providing even more preferential treatment to groups, requiring only a letter for admission. The association has now scheduled the closing ceremony for 1:00 PM on the tenth of this month and has sent telegrams to the central, provincial, and municipal governments, provincial and municipal party headquarters, the Department of Agriculture and Mining, and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, inviting them to send representatives to attend. The location is the Fu'an Cinema in Xiaodongmen. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, a discussion on fisheries improvement was held with aquaculture experts.

Each zone will have a fisheries administration bureau. The objectives are (1) protecting the ocean and (2) enforcing regulations. Each bureau will have an operating budget of 500,000, and five patrol ships. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Administration Bureau will be established first, reorganized from the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Affairs Bureau; (C) Maintaining existing fisheries and promoting new-style fisheries. The method of maintaining existing fisheries is to ban inshore trawling to maintain it. Promoting new-style fisheries is divided into five types. It is proposed to start with experiments for promoting new-style fisheries: (1) Establishing a central model aquaculture experiment station with an operating budget of 500,000, divided into three departments: fishing, manufacturing, and aquaculture. When the experiments are successful, two more departments will be added: publicity and training. The central experiment station will be located in Wusong for the manufacturing department, which will be attached to the general station. The fishing department will be located in Shengshan, and the aquaculture department will be divided into two locations: the freshwater department will be located on the Beijing-Shanghai line, and the saltwater department will be located in Sanmen Bay; (2) The central government stipulates that offshore fisheries subsidies will be jointly funded with coastal provinces. The central treasury will spend 250,000, and the coastal provinces will spend 250,000 (36,000 per province); (3) Demarcating subsidy areas and prohibited areas. The subsidy method is 30 yuan per ton of each ship, 25 yuan per horsepower, and 30% for a radio. Each fishing vessel can receive about 20,000 yuan in subsidies for fishing in the subsidy area; (4) In addition to subsidies, there are also grants. All domestic fishing vessels that can fish in the offshore areas will be given half of the subsidy. Foreign fishing vessels that are deemed suitable can also receive a 50% grant; (5) The central government stipulates that the aquaculture administrative fee for the 20th year of the Republic will be 1.5 million yuan, 1 million yuan will be used for the operating expenses of the management bureau, and 500,000 yuan will be used for the operating expenses of the aquaculture farm, which will be allocated from the 80 million industrial public bonds; (3) Hou Chaohai, a technician from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining, reported on Jiangsu Province's fisheries administration, starting with formulating a policy, conducting fisheries surveys, and convening fisheries protection meetings. Recently, they are actively preparing to establish fisheries guidance centers in important coastal fisheries locations; (4) Wu Huanru, section chief of the Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs, and technician Zhou Jianyin reported successively on the bureau's planned projects and future active opinions on fisheries.

<h3 id="e116">Complete Suspension of Cotton Cloth and Yarn Production and Transportation <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Customs Broker Workers Continue Strike</p>
<p>Great Panic Among Shipping and Passenger Groups</p>
<p>Due to the Cotton Cloth Trade Association's ban on cotton cloth cartage fees and inspection fees, the customs broker workers in this city have declared a strike. The authorities have sent personnel to investigate in order to review the matter. Yesterday, various passenger groups panicked. The Chongqing steamer therefore changed its sailing schedule. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Situation: After the customs broker workers went on strike, the wharves became even quieter yesterday. Xu Shenggui, a member of the sixth team of the customs broker union inspection team, discovered at the Xintang wharf on the Bund of Simalu that workers from Tiantaicheng Company were privately loading three pieces of broadcloth to Niuzhuang and immediately detained them, reporting to the team leader. Upon hearing this, the union sent personnel to negotiate seriously because the workers had violated the strike discipline. Liu Cai, the foreman of the company, immediately went to the union to apologize and settle the matter.</p>
<p>Impact on Shipping: The strike of customs broker workers has a great impact on shipping and the business community. The Taikoo Company's Chongqing steamer, originally scheduled to sail to Andong yesterday afternoon, had no cargo to load due to the strike of customs broker workers and changed its sailing to Friday (the 10th) afternoon. The Hangfu Company's Fuyuan steamer, originally scheduled to go directly to Chongqing today, must wait for the customs broker workers to resume work before sailing. The China Merchants Bureau's Guangli steamer, originally scheduled to sail to Fuzhou on Saturday (the 11th), could not load goods for the construction group due to the strike of customs broker workers. If the customs broker workers still have not resumed work by then, the steamer will inevitably have to change its schedule as well.</p>
<p>Panic Among Various Groups: Various passenger groups in Fujian, Yantai, Niuzhuang, Tianjin, Andong, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Hankou, Yichang, Chongqing, Jiujiang, Changsha, Anqing, Wanxian, Shashi, etc., because the Consolidated Tax Bureau will treat all cotton yarn and cotton cloth with permits issued before April 15 as new goods and collect new taxes according to regulations. Therefore, after the customs broker workers went on strike, those who had ordered goods from foreign firms were worried about the strike being prolonged and panicked. Yesterday, the San Shan Guild Hall in Hubei, Shanghai, sent a letter to the customs broker union, saying, "We have received your union's reply stating that the suspension of work on foreign cloth will inevitably be followed by cotton yarn, which is due to procedures and not intentional. Reading it, we are even more doubtful. Foreign cloth and cotton yarn are clearly two different categories. Your union's suspension of work on foreign cloth is to prompt the foreign cloth group to realize and also reject our group. What effect will this have? Our group has no power to cooperate with your union in negotiating with the foreign cloth group. Aren't we being innocently implicated? Moreover, the new regulations will be implemented on April 16. If the cotton yarn our group is currently purchasing is not loaded before the 16th, we will have to bear another tax burden. At a time when the yarn industry is declining, how can we bear repeated losses? We sincerely hope that your union will understand the situation and immediately notify the workers to allow our group's cotton yarn to be loaded on the next vessel as a special consideration. We look forward to public cooperation."</p>
<p>Guild Hall Meeting: The Cotton Cloth Trade Association held a special emergency executive committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the strike issue of the customs broker union. All committee members attended, chaired by Chen Shunian. It was resolved: (1) To submit a request to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to order the customs broker workers to resume work as soon as possible; (2) To publish a notice in the newspaper immediately to correct the customs broker union's announcement.</p>

<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities is responsible for the administration of public utilities and public enterprises in the city, such as water, electricity, gas, land and water transportation, and wharf warehouses. In recent years, the business has expanded, and the number of technical, health, and administrative issues has increased accordingly. In order to improve administrative efficiency, the bureau has specially formulated methods for grouping and researching specialized problems. According to the scope of the bureau's business, the technical aspect is divided into six groups: water supply engineering, civil engineering, strong electrical engineering, weak electrical engineering, thermal engineering, and transportation engineering. The administrative aspect is divided into seven groups: legal system, personnel, documents, compilation, accounting, general affairs, and business. Personnel within the bureau who specialize in a certain type of engineering or are familiar with a certain type of administrative affair participate in the organization. It is heard that the groups have been established, and when problems arise, they are handed over to the relevant group for collective discussion and appropriate resolution. It is also heard that in addition to problems arising within the bureau, all municipal agencies, private public utility companies in the city, or other parties who encounter problems within the scope of the above-mentioned technical groups can also commission the bureau to issue them for research.</p>

<p>More than a Dozen Workers Detained</p>
<p>At about 2:00 AM on the 4th of this month, a fire broke out at the Shanghai South Public Bus Company's Xinqiao Road Siming Gongsuo next door to the depot because the plumber Zhuang Gengeng accidentally melted the axle bush with a red-hot soldering iron while repairing bus No. 8, causing damage due to negligence. A total of 21 buses were destroyed. The details have been reported in this newspaper. After the accident, the company repeatedly held meetings to discuss the aftermath and decided to temporarily lay off 17 of the 30 copper and carpenters in the factory in order to save money. Upon hearing this, the workers were greatly alarmed and went to the company at 1402 Zhonghua Road, Ximen, at 10:50 AM yesterday to protest. The factory engineer, the American Li Huai德, directly reported to the Public Security Bureau. The detective captain Lu Ying ordered detectives Wu Xiufeng and Gao Juchuan to suppress the situation. At that time, the engineer and the workers disagreed and started arguing with each other. Li Huaide was punched several times, and two glass windows were broken. The detectives immediately reported to Yan Changen, the police officer at post No. 26 of the Second Section of the Second District. Eleven workers were arrested on the spot and taken to the station. After Director Zhang questioned them one by one, the workers gave their names as Zhang Bangrong (27 years old, from Ningbo), Luo Donglin (24 years old, from Suzhou), Zhou Bosun (20 years old, from Taizhou), Chen Quanfu (24 years old, from Ningbo), Hong Yilin (21 years old, from Ningbo), Cao Xingen (27 years old, from Ningbo), Chen Linfa (18 years old, local), Xu Jindi (17 years old, from Ningbo), Chen Menghu (17 years old, from Taizhou), Ding Wenbin (19 years old, local), and Lv Lubao (36 years old, from Anhui).

<p>Non-Companies May Not Use Company Names Without Authorization</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a register to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs due to changes in members and member representatives, requesting approval for record-keeping. It received a reply yesterday, saying, "We have received and reviewed the submission. According to the report, the three store members, Yicheng Company, Zhihua Yin Company, and Yufeng Company, do not appear to have registered with the Bureau in accordance with the law. Moreover, Wanfeng Fertilizer Company was previously registered with the Bureau under a business name but is now using a company name without authorization, which is not appropriate. You should follow the instructions and inform them to make separate statements or stop using the name." It is heard that the association has forwarded the letter to its members to comply with.</p>

<p>The disaster in Shaanxi has worsened since spring. The China Foreign Famine Relief Committee recently raised 35,000 yuan to alleviate the urgent situation. The committee received telegrams from Shaanxi yesterday, which are recorded below: (1) The Shaanxi China Foreign Famine Relief Committee sent a telegram, saying, "We have just received Chairman Kang's telegram, informing us that your committee has allocated 35,000 yuan for famine relief in Shaanxi. The good news has come from afar, and we are extremely grateful. We hope that you will continue to provide assistance so that we can provide universal relief. We hereby express our gratitude by telegram." (2) The Shaanxi Provincial Relief Committee sent a winter telegram, saying, "We have just received Chairman Kang's telegram, informing us that your committee has assisted Shaanxi with 35,000 yuan. We admire your compassion and generosity, which has benefited the survivors. We are filled with admiration for your noble spirit. On behalf of all the disaster victims in Shaanxi, we respectfully express our gratitude." It is heard that no fewer than eight million people in the province are waiting to be fed. It can be said that a cup of water cannot extinguish a burning cart of firewood. Fortunately, Shaanxi expects a good harvest this summer. However, there are at least two months before the wheat harvest. In this period of scarcity, if all sectors do not find ways to provide more assistance, more people will starve to death. Therefore, the committee is seeking help from all philanthropists to quickly rescue the current crisis.</p>

<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society has repeatedly received telegrams from Chairman Zhang Fang of the Henan Provincial Relief Committee, stating that Henan Province has suffered from successive military bandit and drought disasters in dozens of counties. Now, at a time of scarcity, the disaster situation is extremely tragic. The dead have long filled the ravines, and the living are waiting to die and cannot live another day. Your society has now publicly appointed Mr. Feng Yangshan to come to Henan to provide relief. We have selected the three counties with the most severe disaster situation, Yuxian, Baofeng, and Chichi, and plan to distribute aid as soon as possible to expand relief. In addition to sending a separate telegram to Representative Li to discuss nearby, we have sent a telegram urging you to come quickly." The society is currently handling spring relief work in Shaanxi, Liaoning, Ping, Su, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces, including porridge factories and work relief. In Wugong, Shaanxi, and Suizhong, Liaoning, we are distributing dry rations. We are also burying accumulated corpses and distributing spring cloth in Wugong. Relief funds are extremely strained, and it is difficult to raise enough. Although the disaster situation in Henan Province is extremely serious, we must go. We can only select the most severely affected counties and do our best to fulfill our duty and serve the people. Mr. Feng Yangshan is currently preparing everything and is scheduled to depart for Henan with a friend around the middle of the lunar month to contact Chairman Zhang for inspection and relief work.</p>

<p>At about 7:00 PM the day before yesterday, a young girl boarded a Lujiadu ferry at the Ning Shao Wharf on the Sixteenth Bund. Just as the ferry was about to reach the Pudong Wharf and before it had docked, the girl suddenly emerged from the crowd and jumped into the river to commit suicide. At that time, it was just getting dark, and the boatmen could not rescue her. Fortunately, her body floated to the surface for a moment and was rescued by a nearby boatman. She was rescued and immediately sent to the police at the ferry terminal and taken to the third district of the Public Security Bureau. According to the girl's statement, her surname is Yang, her name is Jinzhu, she is 15 years old, from Nanjing, and lives at 1 Rongxiangli, Fangbang Road. Her father's name is Yang Laojiu, and he works as an insurance agent on the Xinshandaolun steamer. Her biological mother passed away five years ago, and her father remarried a stepmother (i.e., her stepmother), Li, four years ago. She is often abused by her stepmother and cannot bear the oppression. Her father is not often at home, so she has no one to tell her sorrows to. She had no choice but to jump into the river to commit suicide. The district chief felt that her situation was very pitiful and ordered the police to summon Li to the district yesterday morning. Li stated that she was 26 years old and had not abused Jinzhu. She requested an investigation. The district chief sent a letter to the relevant Second Section of the First District to investigate and handle the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Unfathomable Intentions of Ye Zhongfang <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Sixteen Letters Filled with Tender Emotion</p>
<p>Soon to Return to Shanghai to Meet Shirley</p>
<p>Trial Postponed to the 23rd for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Must Appear in Court or Face Arrest</p>
<p>Ye Zhongfang, grandson of the late Ye Chengyuan, nicknamed "Little Shaker," informally married Chen Xiuzhen, daughter of Chen Zhigang, who had served as a translator for lawyer Gan Weilu before going to Wuxi and being killed by bandits, the year before last. After his legal wife, née Lu, found out, she frequently scolded him. Ye then began to feel the pain of a husband caught between his wife and concubine, and abandoned his sweet home, moving far away to live a lonely life, neglecting his family affairs. Recently, Ye's wife, née Lu, believing that her husband's departure was solely caused by Xiuzhen, specifically accused her at the French Concession court. Chen Yan, Xiuzhen's mother, because the Ye family lived on Jiaozhou Road, also hired lawyer Xue Jiaqi to accuse Ye Zhongfang in the Special District Local Court of seducing her daughter. The original complaint is as follows:</p>
<p>Original Complaint: This is a private prosecution for the defendant's continuous intent to commit adultery and seduce a woman under the age of twenty away from the person who has parental rights, in violation of Article 257, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The facts of the defendant's crime are stated below: The private prosecutor's biological daughter, Chen Xiuzhen, is currently nineteen years old. She was formerly a dancer at the Chang'e Dance Hall in Shanghai, known as Shirley. In May of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the defendant came to the dance hall to dance, and became acquainted with Xiuzhen. Admiring Xiuzhen's beauty, he immediately intended to seduce her. He often took her to play in his room at the Fanwang Palace Hotel and the Cangzhou Restaurant. After a long period of intimacy, the defendant used enticements, dazzling Xiuzhen with his wealth, and claiming that he was on bad terms with his wife and would marry her as his legal wife after divorcing her. Through various deceptions, in June or July of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, he seduced Xiuzhen to the Far East Hotel to commit adultery in a private room. Afterwards, he continued to commit adultery in hotel rooms. At that time, Xiuzhen was only seventeen years old and weak-willed. After being seduced by him, she concealed the matter from the private prosecutor. Until the morning of December 22nd of the same year, the defendant suddenly came to the private prosecutor's home to visit Xiuzhen, falsely claiming that they would go out for breakfast and return. Unexpectedly, she never returned, disappearing like a yellow crane. Waiting until the 25th, the private prosecutor reported the abduction to the French Concession Lujiiawan Police Station. However, the defendant had lured Xiuzhen away and lodged with her in Room 11 of the Xinxin Society. On the 26th of the same month, he rented a house at No. 45, Mingde Lane, Fuxu Road, second floor. Until January 17th of last year, the defendant and Xiuzhen went together to lawyer Jiang Baoli's office and signed a husband-concubine contract (three copies in total, each holding one copy, with the remaining copy at lawyer Jiang's office). Later, Xiuzhen returned home and told the private prosecutor what had happened. The private prosecutor learned that Xiuzhen had lost her virginity to the defendant long ago. The matter was a fait accompli and could not be undone, so she had to tolerate it. Unexpectedly, on March 1st of this year, the defendant suddenly quarreled with Xiuzhen and sent her back to the private prosecutor's home, abandoning her. He instigated his mother, Ye Peng, and his wife, Lu Yinglan, to fabricate the fact that the defendant had left home due to heartbreak, and hired a lawyer to falsely accuse Xiuzhen of fraud and assault, using newspaper publicity as a method of intimidating the private prosecutor. These are the facts of the defendant's crime. Xiuzhen is currently nineteen years old and not yet an adult. According to the law, she should be under the guardianship of the private prosecutor. The defendant repeatedly seduced her to go out and lodge, clearly violating Article 257, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, intending to commit adultery and seduce a woman under the age of twenty away from the person who has parental rights. Although the private prosecutor later became aware of the matter and tolerated it, this is not sufficient to preclude its illegality. Therefore, this complaint is filed, requesting the Honorable Court to promptly issue a warrant to arrest the defendant Ye Zhongfang for trial according to the law, for the sake of justice. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>Request for Postponement: According to the complaint, the court originally scheduled a closed hearing for the afternoon of the 6th of this month. However, because that day was a holiday, it was rescheduled to 2:00 PM yesterday in the Third Court, presided over by Judge Xiao Xiecai. The plaintiff, Chen Yan, and her daughter, Xiuzhen, along with their lawyer, Xue Jiaqi, etc., arrived on time. The defendant, Ye Zhongfang, did not appear. Lawyers Yan Jiangyi and Dong Yu defended him. According to the lawyer, the defendant had already left Shanghai before this case occurred. His family received the summons and immediately entrusted lawyer Jiang to publish a notice of the hearing date in the newspaper, but he still has not returned to Shanghai and the hearing should be postponed to allow for further notice.</p>
<p>Continued Hearing Rescheduled: Judge Xiao then summoned Chen Yan for questioning regarding her age and address. According to her statement, she is currently forty years old and resides at No. 19, Guangshun Lane, Mother's Hospital Road, French Concession. Her lawyer then presented a recent letter from the defendant to Chen's daughter. It was clear that the defendant knew he had been accused and was intentionally avoiding appearing in court. The judge should issue an arrest warrant. Judge Xiao stated that the defendant should not be afraid to appear, but out of consideration for the first hearing, he ordered that the hearing be rescheduled to the afternoon of the 23rd of this month. If he still avoids appearing at that time, he will be arrested. Chen Yan and others then left.</p>
<p>Sixteen Letters: It is said that Ye, after hearing that he had been accused, still frequently exchanged letters with Chen Xiuzhen. To date, Xiuzhen has received as many as sixteen handwritten letters from him. Although none of them clearly state the place of origin, examining the postmarks on the envelopes reveals that they were all sent from Nanjing or Pukou. Only one letter was mailed in Beijing. The wording of each letter mostly contains repentance and sorrow, indicating that his heart is full of complaints, which he cannot express and unconsciously reveals between the lines. Several letters also contain attachments, such as the article "A Love Letter is Worth a Love Novel" recently published in the "Kuaihuo Lin" section of the Xinwen Bao, which was enclosed with the letter sent from Beijing. Also enclosed with a letter was a newspaper advertisement with the heading "The Falling Flower is Intentional, but the Flowing Water is Heartless," and on the back of which was written, "The result of me and you, such a pitiful past, unbearable to recall."</p>
<p>Two Photographs: There are two letters with attached photographs. One contains a photograph of the Sword Testing Rock at Tiger Hill, with the following poem by Cui Hu written on the front: "Last year, on this day, in this gate, a face and peach blossoms reflected each other's red. Where has the face gone? The peach blossoms still smile in the east wind." At the back of the photograph is added that it was taken with difficulty while recovering from spitting blood, and sent as a keepsake. This letter was sent from Nanjing. On the "back" of the envelope is written: "Last year we visited together, this year I wander alone. Thinking of the past, I am so sad. Li, the person I love in my life, you and I were in love for so many days, but unfortunately we separated. This photo was taken with difficulty while spitting blood, so it doesn't look like me. I'm sending it to you as a keepsake." The other contains a photo of Ye Zhongfang sitting in a rickshaw, only an inch long and about three-tenths of an inch wide. Several words are written on the back of the envelope: "This photo in the envelope was taken before I took the exam. After this, I may live, I may die, maybe this is my last photo. Cut it out and send it to you, I wonder if you will accept it, my beloved." On the back of the photo is written, "Li, if you still love me, please keep this photo. Zhong."</p>
<p>Recent Letter: On April 4th, another letter was sent from Nanjing, saying: "Li, I ran into an acquaintance from Shanghai in this unfortunate place. Unable to avoid him, I stood on the street and talked for a long time. He said that you recently hired Mr. Yao from Tebak. (Alas, my lifelong friend, why are there so many people who are just doing their jobs? The ways of the world.) Actually, why bother? When I was in Nanjing, I already asked someone to make a long-distance call, asking my family to withdraw the lawsuit. He also said that the Special District Court wants me to appear in court to confront you because of your mother's accusation against me. Originally, I am now a person in uniform, someone who is only subject to military law, but in order to express the bitterness and sorrow in my heart before the judge, I am determined to find a way to take leave and return to Shanghai when necessary. I will meet you with this thin, ghost-like face in a place I don't want to see you. Alas, pitiful Li, you are determined to break up with me. You don't want to remember the past, and in the future, you will follow "someone else." Alas, the person I love so much, you are gone with everything unwilling, leaving me alone, like a fool, looking back and forth. The most tragic thing in the world is nothing more painful than this. Soon, maybe I will see you. When I see you, can you allow me to talk to you a few words? This is my only hope in life. Thinking about where I will see you, my heart becomes sad again. I am ashamed of myself, why don't I have the courage to commit suicide? If I die, everything will be over. I am very sad and can't write anymore. Looking back on the past, it seems like a spring dream. Alas, goodbye. I wish you a bright future and boundless happiness."</p>
<p>Husband-Concubine Contract: The contract is made between Ye Zhongfang, a native of Zhenhai County, Zhejiang Province, currently twenty-two years old (hereinafter referred to as Party A), and Chen Xiuzhen, a native of Shanghai County, Jiangsu Province, currently eighteen years old (hereinafter referred to as Party B). Because both parties are in love and willing to form a husband-concubine relationship, they specially agree to the following: (1) Party A shall provide Party B with food, clothing, and shelter, and shall not abandon Party B forever.

<p>Requesting Discussion at the Annual Meeting of Western Taxpayers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the proposal to nationalize the land of the Dahua Hotel in western Shanghai, which was previously deemed wasteful and of little practical benefit by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department and was not approved, has now been drafted into a resolution by the original proposer, Harrison, and co-signed by Fei Wusheng, General Secretary of the YMCA, and submitted to the Public Works Department for inclusion in the agenda of the Annual Meeting of Western Taxpayers on the 15th of this month.

<p>Suspicious Pedestrian</p>
<h3 id="e133">Shot Dead by Detectives <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Resisted Inspection</p>
<p>Turned and Fired Back</p>
<p>Detective Li Returned Fire</p>
<p>Resulting in Instant Death</p>
<p>At 3:30 AM yesterday, detectives Kong Qingping and Li Dacheng of the Putuo Road Police Station were patrolling the corner of Binlang Road and Xiaoshadu Road when a man, about thirty years old, suddenly rushed forward from behind. The two detectives, seeing his suspicious behavior, ordered him to stop for inspection. However, the man ignored them and continued to run as before. The two detectives also quickly gave chase. Near a bamboo fence, the man suddenly stopped, turned around, and fired a shot backwards. Detective Kong ducked to the ground to avoid it, and Detective Li immediately drew his gun and returned fire, firing six shots in succession. The bullets hit the man's head, hand, and other parts in three places, and he immediately fell to the ground and died. The detectives then seized the handgun he was holding, which was still loaded with seven bullets. They then carried the body to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. At 10:00 AM, they reported to the Special District Local Court and commissioned Inspector Guo to come to the office for inspection. He took his seat, and Detectives Kong and Li reported the circumstances of the deceased's resistance to arrest at the time, and stated that because he was killed on the spot and no relatives were found, they did not know the deceased's name, origin, or address. Mr. Guo then instructed the Pushan Villa to claim the body for burial.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Industrial Bank</p>
<h3 id="e134">Savings Department Chief Embezzles Funds <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Misappropriated 64,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Further Investigation Awaits Recovery</p>
<p>Chen Mutao, a native of Jiaxing and deputy chief of the Savings Department of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, recently fell ill and requested leave to be treated at the Shanghai Municipal Hospital on Xuejia浜 in the Nanshi district. The president of the bank assigned someone to take over his duties. After investigation, evidence of Chen's continuous embezzlement was discovered, with the amount of savings misappropriated reaching 64,000 yuan. The president of the bank then reported to the General Police Station, dispatching detectives Wu Chunrong and Qian Xianting to the hospital to question Chen. Because Chen had committed embezzlement, if he was not closely monitored, it would be difficult to prevent him from taking the opportunity to escape after recovery. Therefore, Chen was transferred to a hospital established by the Public Works Department for treatment and monitoring. Chen also admitted to embezzling bank funds without denying it, claiming that it was all spent on subsidizing his younger brother's tuition, etc. Yesterday morning, the police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated to the Special District Local Court that the case could only be investigated after he recovered. Judge Xu approved the request after review.</p>

<p>Reportedly Caused by Jealousy</p>
<p>Around 12:00 PM the night before last, a man, Mr. Jia, about thirty years old, dressed in plain clothes and resembling someone from northern Jiangsu, was assassinated by his enemies in the Beichujia Bridge area of Aiglun Road in the French Concession. He was shot and wounded in the head and right flank, falling to the ground and dying. Passersby saw the incident and reported it to the police station, ordering detectives to investigate.

The detectives reported the situation to the police chief and had the body moved to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Mortuary for forensic examination. No relatives were found. Yesterday, the Criminal Section of the French Police Station reported to Judge Zhu of the French Court for forensic examination. It was confirmed that the deceased had been shot and killed. An order was given to take photos, and the court provided a coffin for collection and temporary storage, awaiting relatives to claim the body. The police station will investigate and bring the murderers to justice. It is said that Mr. Jia was assassinated because of jealousy over a prostitute.</p>
<p>Ewo Fusheng Steamer</p>
<h3 id="e136">Large Quantities of Passenger Cargo Stolen <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Stolen Ramie Fabric and Rayon</p>
<p>Losses Around 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, a large batch of cargo was stolen from the Ewo Fusheng, a steamer of the Ewo Yiyang Company, while loading goods in Shanghai. The reporter went to various places to investigate the details of the incident as follows:</p>
<p>Loading and Transporting Cigarettes: The Fusheng is a regular northbound ship of the British-owned Ewo Yiyang Company, scheduled to go to Tianjin yesterday, as well as Yantai via the bay. Yesterday, the ship was docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou to load goods. When the Yantai passenger cargo was being loaded, it was discovered that a large number of valuable cargo items, amounting to more than sixty pieces, had been stolen from the ship. This could not have been done by one or two people. After the ship's staff discovered the theft, they conducted a thorough investigation, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Amount of Cargo Stolen: Among the exports of the Fusheng this time, there were sixty-six pieces of ramie fabric from the Yuelai Public Report of this port being transported to Yantai (S2 Shengli Mark), and one piece of rayon with the VYK brand, all being delivered from Shanghai to Zhifu. Because the goods were valuable, they were ordered to be loaded into the secure cabin to show caution when they were unloaded from the ship. The goods were unloaded on the night of the 7th, and the theft was discovered yesterday morning. It is expected that the theft took place in the latter half of the night of the 7th.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Police for Investigation: The estimated value of the sixty-seven pieces of stolen goods is about 6,000 taels. At that time, the ship's crew searched the ship thoroughly without success and reported to the head office. On the one hand, the Dongyue Public Report Customs Broker was notified that the losses were too great, and that the theft of goods from the secure cabin would hinder future transportation. Therefore, both Yiyang and Dongyue Public Report reported the matter to the water and land police and the concession police station for investigation. The cargo owner also offered a reward for information leading to the arrest of the thieves. A reward of 100 yuan will be given to those who provide information leading to the cracking of the case. If the goods can be recovered, a reward of 10% of the value of the goods will be given.</p>
<p>Fusheng Export: Yesterday, the Fusheng completed the loading of goods and passengers as usual and cleared customs. It left Shanghai at 2:00 PM and went directly to Tianjin via the bay. The theft case will be investigated in Shanghai, with the hope of solving it soon.</p>

<p>French Police Station Solves Case</p>
<h3 id="e138">Several Communist Organizations Busted <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Fifteen Reactionary Elements Arrested</p>
<p>Last month, the French Concession Police raided several Communist organizations on Rue Conty (康悌路) and Route du Père Robert (金神父路), arresting fifteen Communist members including Guo Biao-zhen (郭標振), Zhou Cheng-xian (周成先), Yu Wen-fa (余文發), Wang Chang-fa (王常發), Jiao Guang-hua (焦光華), Hong Hai-fan (洪海帆), Zhou You-yi (周有義), Liang Gong-zhou (梁貢州), Wang Liang-quan (王凉泉), Huang Shou-nong (黄瘦農), Miao De-shu (谬德書), Chen Shi-ping (陳誓平), Guan Ying (關英), Li Gong-da (李公達), and Zuo Wan-yu (左萬宇). A large quantity of Communist books and pamphlets were confiscated. The suspects were taken to the police station for interrogation, as previously reported. Yesterday, the police transferred the defendants to the French Concession Court for prosecution. The Western Detective Chief first explained the situation, stating that the defendants were divided into three groups, all of a reactionary nature, and requested an investigation.

<h3 id="e139">Further News on the Demolition of Gelao Archway <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Xianji Road Renamed Guangqi Road</p>
<p>The Gelao Archway on Xianji Road (縣基路) was built in the early years of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty. As it straddled the road, it significantly obstructed traffic. Due to its age and lack of repair, it was dilapidated and in danger of collapse. The upper stone material had been largely fractured after a fire. Even if repairs were desired, there was no way to proceed. Previously, the municipal authorities of this city renovated and improved the buildings on the west side of the road, and the old buildings on the east side are also awaiting demolition. The archway posed numerous safety hazards, and leaving it isolated in the middle of the road was risky. If struck by a heavy vehicle, the upper stone material could collapse at any time. For public safety and convenience of traffic, it was better to dismantle it as soon as possible. It is now reported that the Gelao Archway was completely demolished the day before yesterday. All the dismantled stone materials were handed over to Xu Cheng-zong (徐承宗) and others, descendants of the archway's namesake, for preservation. The municipal government, in order to permanently commemorate Xu Guangqi (徐光啓), a Ming Dynasty scholar, for whom the archway was originally built, has renamed Xianji Road as Guangqi Road (光啓路). This is to show that even while reorganizing municipal affairs, the intention to remember past sages is not forgotten.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhao-xiang (章兆翔), the Detective Chief of the Fourth District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, was arrested and detained by the local court for allegedly beating boatman Lu A-gen (陸阿根) to death. It is learned that yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Prosecutor Yang (楊) continued the preliminary hearing.

Then, the witness Lu Gen-xiang (陸根祥) was questioned about the facts. The judge then asked the deceased's wife if her husband had made any dying statements about being beaten after returning home. She replied that her husband said he was slapped and kicked by the detective chief, causing dizziness and leading to his death. At that moment, Lu Yang-shi burst into loud cries in court. The judge quickly stopped her and gently ordered her to leave the court. The hearing continued with Detective Zhang, who denied the charges and was ordered to be detained pending further investigation.</p>

<p>The German company Koch &amp; Co. (高吉洋行) on Museum Road (博物院路) in this port sells a kind of Ankang Yisi pills, namely Okasa. Previously, the Central Health Experiment Institute legally tested the pills and found that they contained yohimbine, a poisonous plant alkaloid. The company was warned, and the Municipal Health Bureau sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to strictly prohibit the sale of the pills. Recently, the company has resumed publishing advertisements in newspapers, arbitrarily promoting the pills and using letters from unqualified and unregistered doctors to promote them. The Municipal Health Bureau considers these pills to be indecent and harmful to the health of citizens. If they are not effectively prohibited, the source of harm cannot be eliminated. It is reported that the bureau has notified the Daily Newspaper Association (日報公會), instructing all newspaper offices to refuse to publish advertisements for these pills in the future. At the same time, it has sent letters to the Public Security Bureau, ordering its subordinate departments to strictly prohibit the sale of the pills, and also sent letters to the police stations of the British and French concessions to prohibit them as well.</p>

<p>Tenants Petition for Cancellation</p>
<p>The houses in Fukang Lane (福康里) on Xinza Road (新閘路) are owned by the Xi (奚) family, wealthy dye merchants, and were all built more than ten years ago. The residents are all legitimate merchants and have always paid their rent on time. Recently, it was heard that the landlord suddenly issued a notice proposing to uniformly increase the rent by several percent, with some increases as high as 40%. The land in this area was neither newly purchased at a high price, nor is it comparable to building houses on rented land. In this autumn of expensive gold, cheap silver, pearl rice, and cinnamon firewood, all merchants and common people are feeling the pain. Therefore, all the tenants in the lane find it impossible to accept this rent increase. Yesterday, they organized a tenants' association and sent a letter to the landlord, requesting immediate cancellation. They are currently actively pursuing this goal and will not stop until it is achieved. It is hoped that the landlord will take this situation into consideration and find a satisfactory solution.</p>

<p>Wu Hong-shou Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>Wu Hong-shou (吳鴻壽) and his wife, Ms. Jin (金), opened the Anli Cosmetics store. Their products, such as Zhilan Cream (芝蘭霜) and Snow Cream, were popular among women and sold widely in various ports. This caused jealousy among foreigners, and the German company Melchers &amp; Co. (美最時洋行) sued Wu in the Special District Court, claiming that Zhilan Cream was similar to their product, "4711" Floral Cream, and was therefore a counterfeit. Wu argued that Zhilan Cream was completely different from "4711" and that the plaintiff's accusation was false. He hired lawyers Zhang Jia-hui (張嘉惠) and Li Jun-huan (李鈞寰) to counter-sue the company's German manager, Huide-men (惠德門), for false accusation. After the Special Court concluded its investigation, the verdict was announced yesterday afternoon by Judge Cheng Shang-feng (程尙豐).

<p>North China Attacks Fiercely in One Go</p>
<p>The North China team, wearing uniforms half blue and half white, lined up facing south. The Central China generals, in yellow and red uniforms, symbolized the iron-blooded doctrine they embraced, and prepared to march north. Referee Chen Ji-xiang (陳吉祥) blew a silver whistle, and the battle began. North China kicked off. Zhao 　Feng 　looked into the distance, passing the ball to the right. Huang Yu-jia advanced quickly, and Central China's left back Cheng Guo-yin, in this critical moment, let him slip past, resulting in a corner kick. Huang Yu-jia's shot was excellent, and Huang Zhen-sheng shot fiercely, but the ball went over the bar. In an instant, North China's five forwards arrived together, their coordination excellent and their speed swift. The Central China goal area was dominated by North China's forwards. Judging from this situation, it was clear that North China would prevail.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Central China Seizes the Opportunity to Counterattack <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Central China tried its best to defend in this critical situation, and immediately counterattacked at the first opportunity. Li Ben-xin passed the ball to Wang Yi-de, a great opportunity, but North China's defense was weak. Unfortunately, the pass was weak and was intercepted. Xiao Bo passed the ball far to the center forward, and Wang Chang-ying also lost his footing. Central China had a great opportunity, but there was not enough support, and the effort failed. Yu Ke-ding passed the ball, and Yuan, the center forward, dribbled left and right. Xian Zhong-fen tried to stop him but failed, and fortunately Wang 　Wei arrived to kick the ball out of bounds. Central China's momentum should not be underestimated. Later, although North China attacked fiercely again, they failed to score, which they regretted. The first half ended with a score of 0-0.</p>
<h3 id="e166">North China Scores with a Thunderclap <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>After the break, Central China kicked off. Huang Zhi-min intercepted the ball, and Huang Yu-jia skipped through three checkpoints, resulting in a corner kick. North China maintained its advantage. Xian Zhong-fen kicked the ball to the Central China goal area, and Zhao, the center forward, kicked the ball, thinking it would surely go in, but it went wide by a few inches. North China had many such opportunities, but they were either inaccurate or weak. The game was chaotic and indecisive, with no clear advantage. Suddenly, with a thunderclap, Huang Zhi-min kicked the ball, hitting the crossbar and bouncing into the net. This boosted their morale. There were still ten minutes left in the game.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Central China Scores in a Swarm <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>North China took the lead with one goal. Judging from Central China's situation, victory seemed nineteen to one in favor of the North. However, North China's center back Zhang Guo-wei injured his foot and left the game, and Huang Yu-jia retreated to replace him. Central China took the opportunity to counterattack. Li Pi-zu and Wang Yi-de advanced together and sent the ball flying into the goal area. Soldiers from all directions arrived, and Huang Zhen-xun, despite his strength, was at a loss. He was surrounded, and Yuan Qing-wu, taking advantage of the situation, sent the ball into the goal. Two minutes later, the game ended. Each team scored one goal, and an extra thirty minutes was announced.</p>
<h3 id="e168">North China Wins in Extra Time <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>During the thirty minutes of extra time, both teams showed signs of fatigue. Central China defended strictly, and North China attacked fiercely. Zhao Qi-zhe passed the ball to the left, and Zhang De-jiang advanced quickly. Huang Zhi-min headed the ball, but it was not accurate and did not go into the net. Although North China was playing with only ten men, they still had the upper hand. Zhang De-jiang took a corner kick, and the ball hovered in front of the goal. Huang Zhi-min landed his foot on the ground and shot, but the ball rolled into the goalkeeper's hands. Tang Shun-hua kicked, but although he did not kick it in, it had already crossed the white line. The referee then announced that North China had won 2-1.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Review of the Two Teams' Artistry <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>North China Team</p>
<p>Goalkeeper: Huang Zhen-xun was calm and steady, saving the ball reliably and performing well. His slow response to the second goal seemed like a moment of carelessness.</p>
<p>Backs: Wang was better than Xian, but both often lost their footing, which was a flaw.</p>
<p>Center Back: Zhang Guo-wei was very good, providing strong support. The two on the left and right</p>

<p>[Ｉ&gt;One view of the audience (photographed by Ye Chang-lie)&lt;Ｉ]</p>
<p>Guards revealed gaps from time to time. Central China attacked from time to time. The two forwards did not defend rigorously.</p>
<p>Forwards: The five forwards coordinated well and were in good condition. The two wings were agile and fast, which was commendable and outstanding. The center forward dribbled the ball in all directions and was also very proper. Unfortunately, the biggest weakness was inaccurate shooting. So many great opportunities were missed.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Central China Team <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Goalkeeper: The best player in the whole team, steady and reliable. It was not easy to maintain this under such severe pressure. The final goal was not his fault.</p>
<p>Backs: The weakest point of the Central China team. They lost their footing countless times, and the ball went in all directions.</p>
<p>Center Back: The center back Yu Ke-ding was very good, providing excellent support from time to time. Unfortunately, the two forwards were also too weak. They could not defend when retreating, nor could they attack when advancing.</p>
<p>Forwards: Yuan Qing-wu stood out. Wang Yi-de was slow. Although the two wings were brave, they were not fast. Their hearts were willing, but their bodies were not strong enough. Looking at the two teams as a whole, the common major problem was the slowness of action, especially Central China. They did not go to find the ball, but waited, which was impossible. Furthermore, the lack of direction in shooting was a major reason why they could not succeed greatly. Losing the ball was the most dangerous thing. Being able to control the fate of the entire army. The backs of the two teams showed this from time to time. These are things that athletes should strive to improve. Although, gathering temporarily, achieving such results is not easy.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Return of the Fisheries Association <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>—Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>The ocean and lakes are vast and unpredictable, and scaled creatures thrive, and the benefits are immeasurable. Our country's Mi Xi taught the farming and fishing with nets and mesh. The invention of fishing dates back to ancient times. However, the ignorant fishermen are limited by knowledge and are clumsy in technology. The fishing method is passed down from father to son and has not been changed for many years. The fishing gear is new in belief and old in system, and will never be changed. The entrepreneurial spirit is weak, and they are vagrant on the water, aiming for a full meal. They sit and watch their livelihood decline day by day, and strong neighbors take advantage of the opportunity to hunt us. Wheeled boats are like weaving, and the fishing industry is not repaired, which affects the sea border gate. Thinking about this danger and hidden worries, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, and the members of the provincial and municipal party departments have established a fisheries improvement association in view of this. In order to expand the movement, it was decided to hold a fisheries improvement publicity meeting at the Minli Middle School in Shanghai from the 4th to the 10th of this month. Now record one or two to share with readers.</p>
<p>▲The area of Chinese fishing grounds and the ability to fish The association's statistical report stated that the total area of fishing grounds in the world is 1,679,052 square nautical miles, while China's is 271,805 square nautical miles, ranking first in the world. Foreigners estimate that the ocean in our country can produce 466,206,000 yuan, but the current fishing ability is less than one-tenth. At present, the amount of fish caught in our country is only 200,800,000 yuan, of which less than one-quarter are caught by Chinese people themselves, and the rest are owned by the Japanese. How can we not feel heartache.</p>
<p>▲Comparison of the catches of Chinese and Japanese fishermen in Dalian Bay A certain guest who was invited claimed that there are only a hundred Japanese fishermen in Dalian, and ten times as many Chinese, but their income is less than one-tenth of that of the Japanese. Looking at the comparison of the catches of Chinese and Japanese fishermen in November last year, the quantity caught by China was 300,440 catties, and the amount was 22,706 yuan. The quantity caught by Japan was 2,754,694 catties, and the amount was 139,419 yuan. The Japanese residing in Dalian often said proudly, "Chinese fishing grounds need their development." May our people think about it and think about it again. ▲Various sea fish and the import of foreign aquatic products In recent years, European and American fishing ports have been lined up. There are many yellow croakers and silk fish in the East China Sea, small yellow croakers are produced between the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea and in the Bohai Bay. The Yellow Sea produces hairtail, pomfret, and beltfish. The South China Sea produces large beltfish and pomfret. According to President Sun Yat-sen's plan, fish farms and fishing ports should be opened on each coast. This inexhaustible treasure house is enough to enrich people's livelihood and enrich the national economy. The plan has not yet been realized, and the benefits of nets and snares are controlled by foreigners. The total number of aquatic products imported in the 18th year reached 2,688,659 dan, and the total amount was 27,525,828 taels of Guanting silver. This economic loss cannot be said to be insignificant.</p>
<p>▲Green Turtle and Red Turtle, Two-Headed Turtle, as Big as a Boat The exhibition hall has a total of ten. There are many marine meteorological and navigational materials, fishing gear, and fishing tackle on display, as well as new-style fishing boat drawings and nets and aquatic product manufactures from various countries. Looking at all the rooms, the model of our country's fishing grounds, the qiantian mirror, the astronomical clock, and the national emblem made of shells are particularly rare. The green turtle and the red turtle, which are as big as boats, can be called wonders. There is also a yellow croaker that weighs about 40 catties and is more than a zhang long. It is said that only one or two can be obtained in ten years. Its maw is worth a hundred gold, and it is considered a top-grade tonic.</p>
<p>▲Opportunity to Get Fish for Free Everyone Has a Chance This time, 20,000 admission tickets were distributed. 3,000 tickets have gifts. After the guests finished their visits, they held their tickets to the gift area for a lottery. Cuttlefish, squid, small yellow croaker, and prawns are all available. It all depends on luck. I and Zhang Yanggao and Wang Dechang saw that more than 30 people from a certain school only got two small yellow croakers, and the rest were all blank tickets. Zhang Xin, the registration director of Minli Middle School, won a pomfret and a shark with five tickets, which made the viewers envious.</p>

<p>—Yang Yixiao</p>
<p>▲Peach Blossom Salt Produced in Qin Lake Pond, this salt is the color of peach blossoms and expands and shrinks with the size of the moon.</p>
<p>▲Peach Blossom Vinegar There is a kind of peach blossom vinegar that was valued by the customs of the Tang Dynasty. If you use a little bit of it in vinegar-braised yellow croaker, sweet and sour crucian carp, etc., its taste is more delicious than Zhenjiang vinegar.</p>
<p>▲Peach Blossom Rice Peach Blossom Mountain in Songjiang produces peach blossom rice. Each grain is peach-red in color. When cooked in a wok, it becomes rice. When eaten hot, it is soft, glutinous, fragrant, and beautiful, with a unique flavor.</p>
<p>▲Peach Blossom Powder In women's fragrance powder, mix evenly with rouge, called peach blossom powder. Pour it into the palm of your hand and apply it thinly to your cheeks, and it will be as beautiful as flying rosy clouds.</p>
<h3 id="e182">An Unprecedented Kite Lawsuit <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>—Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>In this delightful spring weather, Shanghai is full of houses, and it is often difficult to find a place to fly a kite. It is better to be in the countryside, where fields and meadows are suitable everywhere. Therefore, the children of Shanghai see the demolition and reconstruction places as good places to fly kites. In their spare time after class, they hold various kites and fly them into the wind. The five colors are reflected in the golden sunlight, creating a unique spectacle. However, if you are not careful, the kite will turn over, and the electric wires on the electric poles will have no mercy, and they will inevitably smash the kite to pieces. This is the inconvenience of flying kites in Shanghai. There is an open space near our school, which is also a place for demolition and reconstruction. On warm and sunny days, there must be countless children in the field competing to fly kites. This reminds me of a kite lawsuit that occurred in Hong Kong last year. The situation is quite laughable. There are many Chinese in Hong Kong. Every spring, there are many children who fly kites. However, after Hong Kong was ceded to the British, all municipal powers were in the hands of the British. The authorities sometimes interfered with children's play. Last year, a child in Hong Kong was detained by the authorities for flying a kite. There was also a lawyer who appeared in court to discuss the matter. It is almost unprecedented for a lawyer to handle a kite flying case. The court said that when the child was flying a kite on Robinson Road, he damaged the telegraph wires and the glass windows of a certain surname, which was illegal. It is stated in the law that the authorities have the right to prohibit any recreational activity that obstructs residents or pedestrians. However, the defendant's lawyer requested proof that flying a kite was listed as a recreational activity, and asked the court who was injured this time and what was damaged. The judge said that no one was injured, but in any case, touching the power line while flying a kite was illegal. The lawyer then asked on what basis this law was based, and asked to check it in court. The judge turned over the law book and found that there was no such law. Therefore, a kite lawsuit finally declared the defendant not guilty.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Method of Artificially Creating Goldfish <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>—Wu Jiren</p>
<p>I am obsessed with goldfish. When I worked for the Star Film Company on Route Doumer last year, my colleagues in the documentation department once promoted me to the title of Goldfish Doctor. I dare not live up to the kindness of those who love me. Therefore, I widely consulted and collected materials on fish farming for the adoption of general hobbyists.</p>
<p>One night, Mr. Wang Xianzai and I visited Mr. Guo Yu, the film manager of the three northeastern provinces, on the fourth floor of the Central Building. Mr. Yu is from Shandong. I immediately inquired about the art of raising fish. Goldfish in our country grow in Shandong Province, and the production in Jinning and Jinan counties is the largest. This is what I have personally experienced and witnessed. Mr. Yu is a learned man, and his words are true. Mr. Yu said, "You only know that goldfish are oviparous, but you don't know that they can also be planted artificially." I was very surprised. Mr. Yu said that the origin of goldfish is comparable to that of flies. They can be both oviparous and wet-born. Oviparous means hatching eggs. Artificial breeding is very peculiar. The method is to put silkworm seeds into the water. The water does not need to be large. A pond of ten feet is enough. There is mud at the bottom of the pond. Put the silkworm seeds in it and let them be exposed to the sun. Let it be even if there are consecutive overcast and rainy days. Once the dog days are over, schools of fish swim at the bottom of the water. Feed them with water fleas every day, and they will grow up. Mr. Yu also said that if you want the goldfish to be red, take yellow silkworm seeds and plant them. If you want them to be white, plant white seeds. If you want them to be red and white, take flower silkworm seeds and do the same. At first, I did not believe it. Then Yu quoted the passage in the Book of Rites (Monthly Orders) "In this month, rotten grass turns into fireflies." I suddenly realized. There is still the art of fish farming, which is not convenient to occupy much space in the free section. It has been published in the "New Family" monthly magazine.</p>

<p>—Tian Xuwo Sheng</p>
<p>The setting of kites is to make children look up to get rid of internal heat, and also to cure diseases. During the year, when the climate changes, the qi and blood in the human body also undergo major changes, so the elderly often develop old diseases during the two solstices and the four beginnings of the seasons. Children are physically weak, just like the elderly who are weak, so during the festival, there must be one or two medicines to prevent seasonal diseases, which are used in food, but they are all ignorant and do not realize it. The wheat seedlings of Qingming are one example, which are used to get rid of internal heat, and their effect is the same as that of kites. In palaces, the ceilings are often extremely elaborately painted, which also allows the body, which is suffering from ten thousand kinds of worries, to often look up and sigh to get rid of the heat in the five internal organs. Setting up lanterns on the Yuan Night, which is after the beginning of spring, also makes everyone look up and watch to get rid of their internal heat. The intention is very subtle. However, we are buried in our heads all year round, which is inevitably too unsanitary.</p>
<p>Inserting willow branches on Qingming, the custom says to cut the soul to give it. I don't think so. Western oars use willow wine to treat heatstroke and detoxify the blood extremely effectively. Salicylic acid is extracted from the tender skin of willow branches, also known as salicylic acid. After the Qingming Festival, the willows will bloom, and the soft branches will become old. The nutrients contained in them will disappear, so they are cut off before Qingming and inserted outside the door, so that pedestrians and travelers can take them. The intention is also to treat smallpox and chickenpox. If a person suffers from smallpox, suddenly relapses, and cannot break out, then the heat and toxins will sink into the body, and the person will surely die. If you wash it with a decoction of water willow, the pox will immediately reappear, red and full. The heat and toxins are discharged from the pores, and no one will die. If you take this decoction when smallpox is prevalent, it will clear heat and detoxify, and can promote urination, guiding the heat downward, and it is especially effective for treating dysentery. However, it is effective to take a decoction of willow leaves inserted on Qingming Festival, so I think this kind of equipment is just like inserting calamus and mugwort on the door on the Dragon Boat Festival, so that pedestrians suffering from heatstroke and heat rash can use it. Children use willow branches from Qingming to make circles and put them on their necks, in order to prevent throat rash, scrofula, carbuncles, and other diseases. The head is the head of all yang, and the neck is the meridian through which hundreds of meridians pass. It also takes the ability of salicylic acid to detoxify the blood and make it enter from the pores. Putting a willow circle on a dog's neck is to prevent rabid dogs and mad dogs.</p>

<p>—Ling Hua</p>
<p>The sport of Indian non-cooperation with Britain has suffered a major blow recently. All British goods are not used. Other countries are also affected. However, in the Orient, Japanese goods are selling well. In terms of customs, it used to be able to collect 1.3 to 1.5 million in taxes per day, but now it has been reduced to 300,000 to 500,000. 1 million a day is gone, and the blow is known. Now large cities can still collect house donations. Tax resistance in the countryside is very common and not easy to collect. An Indian carpenter told me that his factory used to have 150 workers, but now it only has 10. The decline of commerce is known. Most of the Indians hired by the British to be soldiers belong to the Nepalese. Seventy to eighty percent are Nepalese. It is difficult to know the total number accurately. Some say that 400,000 to 500,000 Nepalese are strong. The British hire them to be soldiers, so the British cannot use force to control Nepal. Nepal has helped Britain in the European War with bravery. It cannot be underestimated in Europe. Now Nepal is the only one who is blocking the British from entering Tibet. As for the small country of Bhutan, it is also a Buddhist country, but it has been under British protection for a long time. Daojie Dharma Master said that the Buddhist statues in Bhutan are very beautiful. Now these are the only two Buddhist countries in the north, and only one Ceylon Island in the south.</p>
<p>There will be a problem in India in the future, which is in Erji. The northwest border of India is full of Muslim countries. The reason why they cannot fully help the Indians now is that countries such as Afghanistan are still kingdoms and still have sympathy for Britain. However, their people are quite connected with and help the Indian people. One big problem is that Turkey's railway will be extended to the Persian region. This railway is for those coming from Constantinople, and its funds are provided by Turkey, Germany, and Russia. If the northern route is open, the forces of Russia, Germany, and Turkey can be united. Persia is close to Mumbai in western India. After Turkey changed to a republic, its national power has also become stronger and cannot be insulted.</p>
<p>On the 5th, the Eastern Culture Association was held in the University President's Office. The League or Oriental Culture was proposed by the President, Ruthkrishna, and Professor Barili, a Chinese scholar. 20 professors from other universities initiated it. Among the founders were Persians who were very interested in Eastern culture and wanted to invite me to Tagore University. This association was initially called the Asian Culture League. Because I had the "New Organization" advocacy of the Eastern Renaissance Society, I advocated merging. Asia is not as obscure as the word "Eastern." Everyone agreed with my suggestion to use "Eastern." It will be published in newspapers in the future, and people will be sent to China to connect and exchange knowledge. But I asked what the meaning of Eastern culture is and what the goal should be in order to have value. I said that today is a materialistic world. Those who advocate materialism are Marxists. If they advocate new learning, it is no longer a problem and will inevitably be eliminated. As I advocate, I advocate vitalism. Vitalism is so important that no matter what, it can still stand against the Marxist materialism, because materialism cannot be considered complete. I think the goal of Eastern culture is better built on life. The reason is that it is superior and long. The Indian monk, Shina, also agreed with my argument. Only then can we avoid the criticism of metaphysics. As for how to connect, exchanging knowledge between countries is the first step.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Financial Gold Bar Market Reversal and Fall <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Poor Atmosphere... Sudden Increase in Sellers</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Loosening... Returning to a Weak Path</p>
<p>Fell Seven Taels and Four Mace. Yesterday, the gold bar market showed a slight decline. However, the market situation was still calm, without any special changes. The trading volume was only two or three taels, at most five or six taels. The total fluctuation between the opening and closing prices was nine taels, resulting in a reversal and fall of more than seven taels, reversing the gains of the past few days. Trading volume was not large, probably because the foreign exchange rate had narrowed by half a grade, appearing tight but actually loose. Overseas silver markets continued to fall, without causing much reaction. Especially since goods had already opened at a lower price, the major barrier of 740 taels was immediately breached. Afterwards, due to buying activity, it temporarily rose above the barrier, but then resumed a weak state, plunging by eight or nine taels. This was mainly due to an excessive number of sellers and a loosening of the foreign exchange rate, further worsening the atmosphere. However, people's hearts are wavering, and gains and losses are unpredictable. The market trend is mediocre, and buying and selling are even scarcer. Moreover, it is Wednesday, when the foreign exchange market is usually sluggish. However, major banks predict that there is hope for a rebound this morning.</p>
<p>Low Opening at the Start of the Morning. From the opening of the May market in the morning, it fell by five taels, to 738 taels. Major banks continued to fall by three-sixteenths, and forwards by one-quarter. The price of silver also fell by one-quarter, but private telegrams rose by one-eighth. People's hearts turned downward, and it continued to fall by one tael. In a short period, firms such as Shunli, Tong Taichang, Wanxing, Yuan Maoyong, and Cuichangyong successively stepped in to buy, jumping more than five taels. At that time, it had risen to 42 taels and five mace. However, the British gold market was still loose. Various banks were doing forwards at 129375. Soon after, Hengxing and Yuanheng went to the market to sell, and the price failed to hold its ground, plunging more than six taels, calculated as 36 taels. When the first announcement was made, it rebounded by two taels, calculated as 38 taels. Because the listed price was reduced by 125, US dollars by 25, and Japanese yen by one and a half fen. Unfortunately, selling activity resumed, and Tong Taichang, Yuan Maoyong, etc., had already sold again, and then fell more than four taels, to 33 taels and five mace at 9:30. However, British gold banks slightly increased their intake, calculated as 13 for June, and various banks were doing Citibank 30 yuan 04375 to 5 jiao. HSBC had bought British gold at 130625 in April. As the gold market retreated, there were two or three taels of trading volume, and the trend seemed upward. After 10:30, the foreign exchange rate tended to be flat. Mitsui and Zhengjin offered 13 to 130625 for June and July. Sumitomo entered 130625 for July. As for Wanxing, Chengfengyong, and Shunli, etc., all had purchases on the table. The market situation seemed stable and rose by five taels, rising to 39 taels and five mace at 10:40. Suddenly, it returned to a sluggish state, depreciating by two taels. Yuancheng, Yuan Maoyong, and retail investors all had sales, and since recent British gold could settle at 130625, it only counted 34 taels and five mace at 11:30. Afterwards, hedging etc. chased in, rebounding by two taels. Unexpectedly, Yu Da, Tong Taichang, etc., sold out, and it retreated from 36 taels and a half to close at 35 taels. However, goods rose by three qian, and the announced price was changed to 803 taels and four qian, calculated as pressing down 65 or 66 taels to 70 taels, 68 or 69 taels at noon.</p>
<p>Mediocre and Sluggish Afternoon Market. The afternoon market opened at 35 taels and five mace. Suddenly, it was heard that the Indian exchange rate had increased by two annas, and then fell by more than one tael, to 33 taels and eight qian. Then, Cuichangyong and Qianchangxiang, etc., bought in, rising leisurely by more than three taels, to 37 taels and three qian at 3 o'clock. In an instant, it fell back by about three taels, calculated as 34 taels and a half. Then, the Indian exchange rate continued to increase by one anna, and the forward rate increased by five annas. Afterwards, there seemed to be more buyers, rebounding by more than two taels, calculated as 37 taels. Then, due to retail investors selling out, it went downstream immediately, to 34 taels, eight or nine qian at 3:30. After 4 o'clock, it slightly increased by more than one tael, calculated as 36 taels and a half. However, the situation was peaceful, and it would not collapse at once. However, the transaction was very small. At the closing at 4:30, it was 35 taels and six qian, a decrease of seven taels and four qian compared to the previous day. Continuing to do big numbers, it was between 36 taels. The largest price of the day was 42 taels and a half, and the smallest price was 33 taels and a half, with a fluctuation of nine taels. Goods were four taels in the early morning, 35 taels and three qian at noon, 5 taels and two qian in the afternoon, and 5 taels and eight qian at the close. The announced price was reduced by a little 67 or 68 taels. The registered price was 35 taels, and the supplementary water was 31 taels to 32 taels.</p>
<p>Guangdong Faction Bulls Emerged. In the transactions of various firms, Yuan Maoyong, Tong Taichang, Cuichangyong, Wanxing, Shunli, Yuantai, and Chengfengyong, etc., all had purchases. Yuanheng, Fuchang, and Dadecheng, etc., had ups and downs from time to time. Those who did foreign exchange and hedging stepped in. Hengxing, Yuancheng Yong, Zhifengyong, Yongfeng, and Qianchangxiang all sold. Large-scale speculators did not take action in large quantities. In the afternoon, Tong Taichang, Cuichangyong, and Dadecheng all stepped in. Shunli, Qianchangxiang, and Futaiheng had uneven ups and downs. Hengxing and Yuan Maoyong sold slightly. The Guangdong faction sold a total of 700 or 800 orders before and after the market. The bullish faction sold out. The Dalian faction's demand exceeded supply, with more than 2,000 orders stepping in, and 1,000 orders stepped out, already occupying a bullish position.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Foreign Exchange Apparently Tight But Covertly Loose <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and silver markets all reported declines. The HSBC listing also narrowed by half a grade, calculated as British gold at 125, now at one shilling and two pence six two five, US dollars at 25, calculated at 29 yuan six two five, Indian exchange rate at 75, calculated at 81 rupees seven five, French francs at six yuan, calculated at 757 yuan, Heyang at 75, calculated at 73 shields seven five, German exchange rate at one yuan, calculated at 124 marks five, Po exchange rate plus one tael and five qian, calculated at 189 taels seven five, Hong Kong still calculated at 79 taels, Japanese yen plus one and a half fen, calculated at one tael six qian six fen seven five. However, the transaction price of banks was tight at first and then loose, which was truly different in appearance and reality. It was because the gold market had risen for many days in reverse, and had retreated into the 740 tael barrier. Thus, the bank's intention seemed to turn soft, and by the time the market closed at noon, British gold was one two five longer than the day before, the US dollar was two five in the morning, and the Japanese yen fell by one fen. Chinese merchants' transactions were flat, not as many as the previous day, but there were withdrawals and deposits from time to time. In general, there was more supply than demand, with more than 200,000 pounds of British gold being traded, and many banks doing business with each other. Mitsui, Sumitomo, HSBC, etc., all had deposits, and Mitsui and Zhengjin, etc., also sold. As for the US dollar, banks did business with each other for 200,000 yuan. The gold industry slightly settled in, but the Japanese yen transaction was scattered. In the afternoon, the 4th was Wednesday, and there was no market as usual.</p>
<p>British Exchange. The inner market was calculated to have a rise and fall of one eight seven five. The offering price in the morning was one shilling and two pence nine three seven five, and the buying price was three pence. Huabi and Huayi did May nine three seven five with each other.

<h3 id="e188">Silver Market Decline Unabated <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegram, the major silver bars are still in the midst of a decline. The recent period has shrunk by 1875, and the distant period has shrunk by 25, both at twelve pence six eight seven five (equivalent to British gold at one shilling two pence nine three seven five). China and India have both sold, and buyers are watching. The market was quiet after the close due to lack of buyers. The United States sold at the listed price, but not urgently. Also received a New York telegram, the US silver price also shrunk by 25, calculated as the spot price of two jiao seven fen two five. The British dollar to the US dollar and the US dollar to the British dollar have not changed, both at four yuan eight jiao five fen thirty-two twenty-ninths.

<p>Market Overview. At present, the foreign cash market is gradually showing a tight trend, and people's hearts are becoming more and more favorable. Moreover, customers' sales appetite is enthusiastic every day and never diminishes. The market's front cushion does not feel dry, but there is also a concern about support. Banks, in order to maintain the preparation of banknotes, should take precautions. Therefore, although the current cash is abundant, once it is mined by all parties, it should not rise greatly, but also rise in order.</p>
<p>Cash Discount Price. (Foreign Cash) The cash price in the early market suddenly exceeded the new high price, at seven qian two fen six li three hao seven hu half, which is three hao seven hu half better than the previous day. The cash price in the noon market still recovered to its original market price, at seven qian two fen six li. Observing its trend, there is still a possibility of rising. (Silver Discount) Three fen in the early market and two fen in the noon market, which is one fen lower than the previous day. The drawing head still does not add water, but is a white drawing. The bank's front cushion is filled and unbearable, and no one is interested. Auxiliary Currency Market Conditions. The Jiangnan small foreign currency, the supply and demand sides are limited, so the market price does not move, and it is still the same price as the previous day, at six qian four fen. The transaction is slightly more than the previous day, calculated as 6,000 jiao in the early market and 4,500 jiao in the noon market. The Guangdong small foreign currency was six qian four fen two li in the early market and six qian four fen one li half in the noon market. Transactions were made, 150,000 jiao in the early market and 75,000 jiao in the noon market. The copper coins increased by 1,000 wen to 370,000 and 500 wen. The transaction was limited to only more than 27,000 strings.</p>

<h3 id="e190">First Voice of Long-Term News <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Long-term business is the only major element of private banks. In recent years, due to frequent bankruptcies, the danger is worrying. General stable families do not want to make any display, and they often engage in other investment businesses and disdain to do so. Therefore, recently, when the middle ten days of the fourth month arrive, it is the beginning of the long-term settlement, but the news from all aspects is still silent and unheard. However, various industrial factories and other pledged commercial businesses that rely on long-term for adjustment will inevitably continue to seek loans. However, private banks, in order to be cautious in issuing loans, still need to be picky among the old accounts, and new accounts are even more difficult to quench thirst by looking at plums. Yesterday, I received news from the financial sector that, in this long term, most of the deposits were indeed continued, and there were fears of major changes in loans. As far as I know, only dozens of thousands of interest rate panels are being made. It is said that it is necessary to listen to the overall market, and it is expected to be slightly higher than the previous session.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Securities and Bond Markets Still No Honor or Disgrace <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange had already opened. The two sessions in the morning had quite a lot of transactions, with more than 4 million yuan opening. However, it turned quiet in the afternoon, with only more than 2 million yuan opening. A total of 6.065 million yuan was made, of which 19 rolls were particularly strong, accounting for more than 2.8 million yuan. In addition to the demobilization and rehabilitation of troops, each agreement was about 890,000, and other items were very sparse. The spot price was flat, with only 24,400 yuan for the whole day. As for the change in bond prices, the price did not rise or fall much in the two sessions of the former market because the demand for supply was not seen. It was clearer in the afternoon, and the price was even more stagnant. As a result, it was about six jiao smaller than the 96 agreement of the previous day, and the rest mostly only had two jiao of ups and downs.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Yarn and Cotton Trends Differ in Spot and Futures Markets <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm. The actual market demand is extremely smooth. The purchases in South China and North China are the most diligent. Therefore, the situation of spot yarn is becoming increasingly tight. Most of the Japanese yarn is out of stock, and some brands of local yarn are also out of stock. The export of domestic cotton cloth is still strong. Therefore, a major firm has a calm attitude, but some retailers are still selling short because the overseas yarn and cotton situation is consistently falling. Therefore, although spot sales are enthusiastic, the market price has not risen. If actual sales can continue uninterrupted, the future still has the potential to prosper.</p>
<p>People's Bidding Softens. The opening of the People's Bidding market at the exchange. Due to good news in the current second market, but American cotton is flat and falling again, people's hearts are softening, and each falls by six or seven qian. At the close, the Guangdong gang searched for a large number of them, and then rose by one, two, three, five, and six qian. Although spot sales were smooth in the afternoon, the atmosphere was idle, and each fell by two, four, five, seven, and eight qian. The transaction was 22,800 bales. Check the sale of 1,400 bales of Deki, 700 bales of Tongyu, 8,000 bales of Ruida, 600 bales of Dachangcheng, 600 bales of Meiji, the purchase of 950 bales of Changfeng, 650 bales of Yiyu, 800 bales of Tianlong, 900 bales of Yukang, and 600 bales of Shenxin. The closing price of the People's Bidding is recorded on the left.</p>

August, One Six Eight Nine, Eight, Fifty Six, Three Five Zero. June, One Six Nine Three, Two, Seventy Three, Seven Zero Zero. September, One Six Five Eight, One, Eight, One Five Zero. Spot Yarn Sales Smooth. Spot yarn sales are still good. According to the statistics, the various gangs bought a total of 4,000 100 bales for the whole day. The industry entered 500 bales. The market is stable. The customer gang entered 1,200 bales from Guangdong, 900 bales from Yunnan, 450 bales from the inland, 200 bales from the North, 750 bales from Tianjin, 450 bales from Sichuan, 85 bales from Shantou, 200 bales from Qingdao, 105 bales from Jiangxi, 100 bales from Fujian, and 60 bales from the Wei gang.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Cotton Softened by American Cotton <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market has softened, because the overseas cotton market is poor, and the trend is very weak. They all look at 1 jiao to enter the customs. Therefore, people's hearts are particularly empty. There is more selling in the market, but the gold market is difficult to loosen, and there may be no major flaws for the time being. The bottom goods are lacking, and the sales of spot cotton are quite small. Because the yarn price is not high, the factories have no intention of handling raw materials, so the atmosphere is very slack.</p>

<p>Zhabei. Yesterday, the number of ships arriving on the road was still scarce. Sales in this street were extremely weak. The top special japonica rice was still priced at 12 yuan 67 jiao, and the transactions were few. Ordinary japonica rice had increased by nearly one jiao in the early morning, but by noon it showed a flat trend, which was due to poor sales. The sales of thin rice were even more sluggish, and the price felt slightly trimmed. The market situation was very sluggish. The demand for Yang Du Xian Bu Xian was flat. The source was not strong, and the market showed a slightly firm trend. The overall market was not much up or down from the previous day. Bai Yuan arrived and sold to the south, and the situation was still good. The lifting households were quite welcome, so the market for special high-quality goods was slightly tight.</p>
<p>Hunan. Yesterday, there were not many ships arriving on the road. The sales in the market were uneven. Changxi, Su Tong, and various machine japonica rice increased due to the active intention of retail and shop parties. The price rose by jiao outside, and the situation began to be stable at the end. The street sales of Nanbang thin early rice were flat, and the price only increased by nearly a foot. The arrival of Yang Du Jian deposits was silent.

<p>Manufacturers' Replenishment in the Near Term... The Rise is Stronger</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, the prices of each month rose one after another. In the near term, manufacturers replenished their positions, and the rise was even stronger. In the distant term, retail shorts initially followed the replenishment and saw good results, but later they were sold off by inland gangs and became tired again. However, once the manufacturers replenished, people's hearts have turned good. Outside short-sellers did not dare to get involved, and even the short-sellers close to the factory mostly turned long. Therefore, the results were uniformly good in both near and distant terms, calculated as 1.5 points for this month, 1.75 points for next month, 0.75 points for June, 0.25 points for July, 0.5 points for August, and 0.75 points for September.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian market situation was still lively. Because the market price had fallen behind some time ago, it aroused the trial handling of this street and Guangdong gang. The Guangdong gang's trial sales were still worthwhile, and there were inquiries every day. In addition to loading more than 1,000 bags before, they also purchased 400 or 500 bags of Jiangxi rice in the market. This street also followed up and purchased. Therefore, although the market price did not rise, the market atmosphere was not as stagnant as it was a few days ago. A total of more than 100 bags of early Jiangxi machine rice were transacted in the market, priced at 10 yuan 06 jiao half to 10 yuan 06 jiao, and more than 1,000 bags of late machine rice, priced at 11 yuan 3 jiao half to 11 yuan, were divided up by this street and the Guangdong gang.

<p>Yesterday, the opening of the yellow bean market in the morning was quite firm, because the customers of each gang were still very diligent in their intentions to enter the market. The period price of each month was not much up or down compared to the previous suspension.

It was also heard that the gold market reported small in the afternoon and people's hearts were pessimistic. However, because there were inquiries from the inland gang, the distant term was able to stabilize. At the close, April was 4 taels 6 qian 3, down by 2 points, and May was 4 taels 6 qian 1, and the market was stable.</p>
