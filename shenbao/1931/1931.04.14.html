<p>時評</p>
<h3>日内閣總辭後</h3>
<p>日濱口内閣總辭後。若槻新總裁。將繼起組閣矣。今日人所最注目者。爲將維持前内閣之狀態乎。抑如民政黨主張。斷然實行改造乎。此誠新内閣當前之第一問題也。吾憶前次若槻組閣時。適當憲政政友政本三政黨鼎峙之際。憲政爲政府黨。政友爲反對黨勢均力敵。而政友本黨則徘徊於二者之間。有舉足重輕之勢。苟政本與政府乖離。則内閣立見搖動。誠一不易應付之時代也。惟當時若槻繼加藤奉命組閣。同時亦繼加藤爲憲政會總裁。即照加藤内閣方式。力與政本聯絡。而其時政本。因同交會脫離。與政友會反目。遂益與憲政會親密。若槻内閣之地位。始得穩固。但其後政情稍變。若槻爲更謀内閣安定計。拉攏貴族院研究會四人。將内閣實行改造。由是政本漸與政府黨失和。而政友會領袖田中。又乘機謀與政本領袖床次合作。以倒現閣。於是憲政内閣。乃陷於日危之境地。此若槻前一度組閣之經過也。此次組閣。情勢固與前次大異。前次三黨鼎立者。今則僅有兩黨對峙。似於政黨間可減去不少糾紛。然而政友之　敵猶在。民政黨内部意見。亦尙未融洽一致。進行改造。實非易事。今若槻已有實。行適應新事態之政治乃爲當然之言。又有不變民政黨政策。惟不限定行現内閣任命前所决定者之語。可見其對於組閣方針。隱然已具有一種把握矣。</p>

<h3>西班牙市鄕選舉</h3>
<p>共和黨大勝利</p>
<p>民心傾向憲政</p>
<p>帝制西山没落</p>
<p>▲國民社十三日瑪德里電　此次西班牙市鄕選舉、共和黨雖備受帝制派與當道之掣肘與抑遏、而結果竟得絕大勝利、以故票數揭曉後、今晨統國人心、非常興奮、計全國五十省中、共和黨獲得大多數議席者竟達四十省之多、甚至如皮堡與亞里康特等市、所有市議會議席悉爲共和黨所獨得、即在輦轂下之京都瑪德里、共和黨亦以九二·○○○票對三三·○○○票而占大多數、竟至帝制派大本營之王宮選舉區内、亦係共和黨佔多數、雖帝制派亦曾獲得若干勝利、如喀狄一區共和黨未有一人當選、又格拉那達數處、亦係帝制派占多數、而全國民心之趨向共和、已於此可見、故今後或將立即發生有力之反響、亦未可知、惟外間謠傳之國王行將遜位、與王室準備徒寓英國等說、則尙未能證實、外務大臣今晨向報界聲稱、内閣將於下午集議考慮時局、衆料屆時或將决定總辭職、又自治黨領袖麥西亞上校在巴塞洛那聲稱、此次選舉結果、可謂向國王表示一强烈之色彩、倘若國王悍然不顧、圖重建狄克推多制、則革命誕生之時日將不遠、而其之結局或將重演路易十四之悲劇云、</p>
<p>▲國民社十三日瑪德里電　西班牙各地市鄕選舉結果、幾無一非共和黨大獲勝利、如瑪德里·聖丹特·聖塞柏斯馨·巴塞洛那·伐倫西亞等大都市、共和黨員尤居絕大多數、此種勝利情形、即反對帝制最激列之左派份子、亦謂出於意料之外、政府已承認時局嚴重、有不久發生政潮可能、現帝制派已加緊工作、設法保全王位</p>
<p>▲國民社十三日巴黎電　西班牙帝制派之失敗、已使法報大吃一驚、蓋法政界顧慮若干有關軍事行動之秘密協約、近數月間大爲帝制派宣傳、致多數報紙往往對於記載西班牙共和運動力量之報告、多目爲妄談、不料今日突覩其一鳴驚人也、現法報已信此次共和黨之勝利、將在西班牙歷史上開啓一新紀元、且多揣測國王今後是否將作一度最後之　紥、如廻聲報謂國王此時如能讓位於孺子查利、諒王朝猶可保存、平和報則稱、選舉結果、明示君主政體已爲國民公判所共棄、人民報竟在評論末尾、以大字預祝西班牙共和萬歲、至所居巴黎之西班牙逋客覩此結果、當然興高采烈、</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>▲國民社十二日瑪德里電　此處今日舉行地方市政參議十萬人之大選舉、除前已通過無須重選之帝制黨一萬一千人及共和黨一千四百人外、此次尙須舉出市政參議約八萬七千人之譜、政府爲提倡人民注重公務起見、特將選舉法第八十四條在各處遍貼告示、内載凡人民放棄權利、無故不赴選舉者、得將其姓名公佈以示儆懲、凡現任官吏之無故不赴選舉者、將來擢遷時、該項事實亦必加以考慮、若犯第二次時、普通人民應罰其一年所納之稅之百分二、若係官吏則處以百分一之减俸、至下次選舉爲止、現西京正在選舉狂熱之中、自星期六晚始、即用自由車汽車飛機等散播宣傳傳單、星期日上午尙能相安無事、迨近午時各處即有暴動發生、而在巴塞洛那地方爲尤甚、至下午各處情形更形緊張、傳說棒喝黨有攻擊選舉場銷毁選舉票之意、後經警察防止、遂未實現、亦有多處因人民之狂熱、不得不用救火隊之皮帶、以減少其熱度者、</p>

<p>▲日聯社十三日東京電　民政黨爲刷新民心起見、於由若槻組閣時、斷然實行改造内閣調動政務官之運動、關於内閣改造有二說、即今次組閣並非改造、乃係濱口内閣辭職後出現之新内閣、應由若槻任意選擇閣員、又一說苟以維持現狀方針組織新内閣、則將來絕對不易改造、故應調動二三閣員、且現任有力閣員意見、以爲若槻内閣遂行國策、改造内閣爲絕對必要之條件、</p>

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>者、其他各縣農匪、均可不待匪首指使任意捕人殘殺、或已出錢贖身、而仍行捕殺者、蓋匪軍有肅反委員會之組織、其意義在肅清反動份子、其指定應殺之人、爲國民黨員·ＡＢ團·豪紳地主·資本家·智識份子·國軍官兵等、然匪之所謂資本家者、雖四五畝田産之家、亦視爲小資産農、均在被殺之列、其所視爲智識階級者、則略受初中高小之學生、亦皆在被殺之内、其對於國軍士兵、始則以利色引誘投歸、終則苛待、并肆行屠殺殆盡、再以去年吉安失陷的四十日中、據實調查、被赤匪殘殺者、已有一萬三千八百八十二名、被擄者有二萬零七百九十八名、茲分别列表於後、</p>
<p>縣屬　被殺人數　已查明者　未查明者　被擄人數　已查明者　未查明者</p>
<p>吉安　八、九七八　二、五六三　六、四一五　二、八三○　四、九二一　六、九○九</p>
<p>永新　二、一三○　三八三　一、七四七　一、八一七　四三二　一、三五八</p>

<p>其次、則赤匪除焚殺搶刦之外、其對於婦女之殘暴獸行、尤堪髮指、然匪中猶美其名曰解放、實則無異惡魔之攫人而噬耳、蓋赤匪所到之處、凡對於四十歲以下十六歲以上之寡婦或處女、則任意帶至某隊或某會、强近其自由配合、稍一不從、即身首異處、又或其夫不在家鄕、或認爲反動派的妻女、均勒令自由改配、不從即殺、其工作人員、則成羣結隊、闖入民家閨房、任意調笑、逞其獸行、稍一抗拒、即加以反動之名、横遭殘殺、</p>
<p>（三）贛省政治將態　贛省自被赤匪踴躪後、人民流離失所、城鄕爲墟、匪區農民、多被逼爲赤衛隊、自國軍努力搜勦以來、匪區逐次縮小、人心亦漸趨安定、最近又令各縣長協同軍隊、於克復各地、限期組織守望隊、充實人民自衛力量、目前最重要之政治工作、即爲招撫流亡安定人心、加緊反赤宣傳工作、及組織人民自衛團體、他如對於考選各縣更治人員、實施匪區災賑、調濟民食、散發農具、開闢匪區交通等、均在積極進行中、並於行營内組一江西地方整理委員會、計劃克復各地之政治施設、及一切善後事宜、規定程序、督飭施行、</p>
<p>（四）最近勦匪進展及俘獲匪械情形　贛南赤匪朱毛彭黄等大股、麕集贛河以東、利用地形峻險、冀圖負嵎、自本月一日起、國軍分途進勦、迄今不過旬日、已有長足進展、如沙村上杞大逢固陂羅家圩等處之匪已經國軍次第擊潰、斬獲頗多、國軍前線已達龍岡頭江背洞及雩都以東、及城岡東固山之線、又如吉水縣鵝公圩望仙東陂之匪、被國軍擊潰後、已追至新豐招携籐田一帶、而南豐方面、國軍進展尤爲迅速、自魚日佔領遼陂白金干善洽村水南等要地後、其前線已逼近廣昌附近之甘竹長橋等處、赤匪因屢戰不利、紛向寗都石城瑞金等處潰竄、至於贛西方面、則銅鼓宜豐早爲國軍克復、九宮山逍遙山一帶之匪、已次第肅清、孔匪荷寵在黄岡口黄茅慈化江口等處、迭被國軍擊敗、實力散失甚鉅、李匪明瑞近雖連合湘東僞獨立師譚思聰及僞二十軍曾炳春等股、一度襲擊永陽、期解朱毛之圍、而結果又爲國軍羅部擊敗、斬獲千餘、殘匪仍向湘邊鼠竄、將極狼狽、至贛東方面方邵等股赤匪、原以磨盤山一帶爲根據地、近被國軍四面搜勦、並大敗之於茗洋關、斃匪衆四百餘名、奪獲槍械無算、將匪之學校修械場僞政府悉行焚燬、因此脅從農匪紛紛散去、勢已窮促、將近消滅、國軍自開始進勦以來、先後繳獲匪械計三千餘支、朱毛兩匪道、近又意見不合、時起紛爭、不特暗鬥極烈、甚至公然政訕、大有劍拔弩張之勢、而羅匪炳輝本爲朱匪部下之健者、朱素嫉之、近見朱異常跋扈、乃與朱脫離關係、獨樹一幟、朱更啣之、日思除羅、於是彭德懹黄公略兩匪因見朱毛等惡感日深、火併在即、乃亟謀自己之出路、而相約有歸誠國軍之意、蓋以赤匪中之社會民主黨、在暗裏活動甚力、大肆其挑撥離間之手段、因之反朱毛者亦日衆、國軍得悉此種情形、遂乘機猛攻進逼、節節勝利、斬獲極多、而零星携械歸誠者、亦復不少、似此情形、則赤匪之消滅、爲期已不遠矣、</p>

<p>革命政治之下。有監察院焉。其組織如何。姑不贅述。考其性質。即清季之諫台。袁項城時代之肅政史也。專爲清明政治。彈劾大員而設。諸監察委員。宣誓就職。已多日矣。其中似以籍陜川者爲多數。而謝無量其一也。謝蜀人。亦蜀中之大文學家。今人多以謝爲和尙。是誠大誤特誤。蓋謝家非無和尙。然爲叔。非爲仲耳。謝氏昆弟凡十。均爲人傑。無量居其次。三日無忌。法號萬慧。是眞和尙。亦即世人誤作無量者也。萬慧嘗學佛印度。所爲文章。確有一點菩提甘露。洒遍六千之妙。又如天上一片輕雲。飛繞於無聲冷月之四週。有時則如天馬行空。挾山超海而來。所謂性靈之學。剛柔相濟。若一經發其獅子吼。頓使頑瞶者省發。立時放下屠刀。惟無量本人。亦非等閒。年十二三。即在蜀中講學。從遊者數百人。則其聰明與魄力。殆可想見。若僅代神童諛之。實非無量之知音矣。據聞無量並不長於泰西學術。但翻繹尋字典。竟能登台大講西洋歷史。此豈非文章殆天授也耶。當被潦倒海上時。在縣前街賃小屋一椽。操文丐生涯賴賣文所入。俯蓄其妻子。至其際會風雲之萌始。則在孫哲生氏奉命游說東省。說張雨亭成三角同盟。蓋其時無量特任孫氏秘書。借箸爲籌。輔弼於壇坫之間。雍容暇逸。頗多奇謀。未嘗有辱君命。厥功至偉。故雖一再浮沉。今終以監察委員之重任。聞於當時。嗚乎。人力勝天。學則天授。英雄時勢。缺一不可爲也。世人誤無忌爲無量。不啻謂謝家出兩和尙。雖曰一子成佛。九代升天。多多益善。初無惡意存其間。然而無忌獨不可淹没。以愚所知。特爲彰之如此。</p>
<h3>跳牆與做飯之議案</h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>烏托之邦。有團體焉。横徧各邑。直級國都。在團團員。則皆愛國之青年也。世界一攬。政治萬能。惟文牘非其所長。吾弟陶在西。曾與陸敬輿令狐子直輩知制誥。薄有文名。故年雖老大。猶被聘爲秘書。月俸至百元之多。一家之衣食賴焉。一日團員議案。呈報風災。云本團部有井一口。被風吹向牆外去了。議决交秘書辦稿。吾弟苦思惡想。幸而得圓其說。大致稱團部原以木版竹笆編牆。牆隅爲井。是日風力太猛。將此笆籬。吹移向内。越過井口。故一時哄傳井被吹出牆外云云團員咸稱其敏。又一日呈報日記。云團員數人。方在院午餐。忽半空中。有掛爐燒鴨數隻。聯翩飛來。取食甚甘云云。議决交秘書辦稿。吾弟又設法圓其說。稱鄰家係一菜館。適値廚司怒鬭。將鴨抛擲。形似飛來。又一日呈報水災。議决案云。有裝儎石磨之船傾覆。石磨遍浮水面。必須叙入呈文。吾弟呈稱水漲齊樹。船覆當其處。石磨有木柄。柄有手握之竪木如勾。勾掛樹枝。無異浮水。當是時陶秘書公牘之名大噪。然而材輕任重。天倖不可屢邀。未幾而吾弟末日至矣。一日本團議游行。路綫經一夾道。道梗一高廣尋丈之牆。或議開一牆洞以行。反對者以跡近鑽營。不可。或議繞道。反對者謂違背初衷。又不可。或議將牆拆去。反對者曰。本團有創造。無破壞。况拆費無出。方討論間。團長建議。字典上無難字。到時全團出發。本大無畏精神。拆不妥協主義。大家皆一跳而過。是時全塲空氣緊張。一致贊成通過。付秘書辦稿通知加入游行之機關。三日而不能交卷。團長大怒。吾弟曰。死鴨飛於活人之手。井口移於可動之牆。至石磨下一扇無柄落沈。吾愧吾說僅圓其半。今者跳牆議案。文法至此。舞弄已窮。惟有實行捲舖蓋耳。歸而適吾又一弟陶在南者。亦自同樣别一團體辭職而回。駭問。在南曰。吾兄爲跳牆氘讉。予則毁於做飯議案也。緣予團議辦此案。必用調查式。兼明因果律。所謂科學的方法也。予遵將蒸飯。煑飯。　鍋飯。神仙飯。種類如八寳飯蛋炒飯。北方之麵飯。死人之羹飯時間如早飯午飯晚飯。詳加調查。三日送稿不行。有果無因也。飯之前爲米。米如高仙尖罩高白秈粳等類。幸有米市可詢。列爲一表。三日送稿又不行。米尙有因也。於是米之前爲穀。穀之前爲禾。禾之前爲秧。秧之前爲籽種一一如式臚叙。仍不行。必追溯籽種以前。方爲澈底。籽種以前則秧禾穀米飯耳。循環追究。即正神農后稯而仍不得其因。此予之所由敲破飯碗也。於是相對歎惋。改業爲商販焉。</p>
<h3>記張寳三</h3>
<p>— 湛湛</p>
<p>老友崑山王君嚴士。著歲寒堂文稿八卷。中有述張寳三事一則。頗奇而趣。惜文過長。不能備錄。爰撮其大要。以實本談。以餉閱者。</p>
<p>嘉定縣之安亭鎭。明歸震川先生。曾讀書其地。清道光時。鎭人有張寳三者。一無賴子也。以得識藩署書吏某。頗與衙署通聲氣。會其地有胡傅二姓。因爭一婦人搆訟。胡理曲而雄於貲。因以二萬金挽張賄吏。獄遂得解。張朋分其貲稍行小善於鄕里。鎭之人翕然稱之。後有修葺菩提寺者。於額中得震川遺像。張遂構屋三楹於側。供像其中。爲里人士會文之所。并稍出貲以給獎。於是鎭之士人。亦翕然稱之。某年。縣境遘旱災。嘉定令但明倫。以勘荒履鎭。與諸紳士籌賑於會文之所。聞張之爲人。奇之。召與語。大悅。即以賑事委之。於是張竟得列於士紳之列矣。後陶文毅澍。移撫江蘇。入京階見。帝適讀震川文而愛之。命陶至任訪歸。後陶旣履任。僅得歸天於屠户中。命之改名。拔入武庠。嗣又欲爲震川建書院。而難其人。適但以門下士爲屬東來謁。陶語以故。但舉張以對。陶召與語。亦不悅。即以書院事委之。而命六十三州縣。分攤建築費。迨書院落成。凡名公顯官。墨客騷人。皆不遠千里而來會。蕭管徹雲。笙歌達旦。一時稱爲盛事。而張之名亦於是大噪。後張復起甲第於院後。結烟好於名門。居然世家矣。後陶去任。林文忠則徐代之。謁震川像於書院。竟與張分庭抗禮。其餘司道以下無論矣。愚按陶與林皆名臣。聞但亦循吏。張以一無賴。竟能博其青睞。名因以著。而家因以富豈不奇哉。王又言張本不甚識字。欲作書函。口授他人書之。皆有條理。與貴人游。即席飛花行令。古詩成語。脫口而出。建書院時。其圖亦出張手。亭臺樓閣。池石花木。無不位置得宜。然則張亦一奇人也。其見賞於三公。宜哉。</p>
<h3>京滬道上之花</h3>
<p>— 晏因</p>
<p>人恒謂妙齡女郎。爲安慰人生之具。座無佳麗。使人不歡。而於旅客尤甚。孤燈凄舍。往往有舉目蒼凉之感。而娼門妓館。乘時以興。亦所以慰旅客之寂寞也。西北旱道。亦有所謂大道之娼者。自鐵路儧而此輩生涯。亦已絕跡。不謂最繁盛之京滬火車。亦有隨機輪飛馳而操賣笑生涯者。某日之晨。自首都返滬。徘徊月臺上。車尙未出廠也。忽來一粲者。年約二十四五。長身玉立。穿一淺黄色之長旗袍。御一玳瑁邊之眼鏡。革履絲襪。手表皮夾。狀如一女學校之敎員。口操京口音。凡車上之檢票員與車使。若均與之相識。點首爲禮。而伊亦以笑　相迎。余覺其不類尋常趁車之女客。蓋語言舉動之間。佻而不莊。一覽即知。余因詢一熟識之車中執事。曰伊何人耶。笑曰。君殆不知。此所謂京滬道上之花也。聞此女郎。自稱爲某軍閥之如夫人。一星期輒往來於京鎭者數次。以招引旅客中抱孤獨之悲哀者。或三言兩語。目引心挑。則至鎭江下車。以旅館爲陽臺。自鎭江以來者。以下關爲尾閭。倘旅客中而識其人者。更如駕輕車。就熟路也。但此豸之足跡。僅在南京至鎭江一段。聞自常州至無錫以及蘇州。據云另有一人。蘇州至上海一段。則尙無人承乏。以此段佳人更多。殊難著手。鳴呼。民生凋敝。謀食維艱。强者挺而走險。弱者不得不出於此途。人言鴛侶。我比鴻哀。豈僅對於京滬道上之花而增感慨也歟。</p>
<h3>印度遊記（二三）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>九號。聞有熟悉西藏情形者。訪之。據云西藏民數現約三百餘萬。内分黑敎紅敎黄敎三種。全信佛。黑敎者。本來舊派。佛敎居士爲多。紅敎者。蓮花生所倡。於男女問題在寺外不禁。而寺内不可。其拉麻爲戈馬巴。在一般人民信仰上甚占勢力。黄敎者。爲清凈僧派。爲完克巴所創。今達賴拉麻爲其敎皇也。其大寺共有三。一曰百蒙。原定九千九百僧。今萬餘矣。二在根但。原定五千五百僧。今六七千矣。三曰色拉。原定三千三百僧。今有四五千矣。均日見盛。其紅敎勢力。多在滇藏之界亞東關地方。紅敎拉麻亦助黄敎。蓋藏人信轉輪聖王之法。其拉麻如敎皇也。有一種怪事。亦難言全是迷信。拉麻死後再選拉麻。彼可先期示知。在某地投胎。又降人世。則如其至其某處取三五歲小孩來。當衆考騐之。取前拉麻所用之碗筷。雜於衆碗筷之中。使選擇之。彼能選擇不誤。又經三次用麵團卜法。亦經神許可。即正位繼爲拉麻。至其理殊不可解。或有秘術與。未可料也。</p>
<p>至西藏人民對中國感情。尙眷念不忘。達賴亦非忘中國。不過屈於勢力耳。何者。今日英之經營西藏。已有成熟之勢。一方面從缅甸支那通雲南邊界。以控藏東南邊。而三路經營鐵道。均向藏逼近。一由巴克至不丹地方鐵道。不過六日可到。達賴所居西藏都城之拉薩。二條由某至拉薩不過七天。三條由戈理蒙到拉薩。不過十六七日。一旦有事。四路進發。取包圍之勢。無路可逃。而若中國派兵到西藏。從雲南到藏。仍須兩月之久。從四川去。須三月之久。鞭長莫及也。</p>
<p>藏内部有兵萬餘人。快槍數千支。有中國所留者。有英國賣與者。有俄商賣與者。亦有兵工廠可自製。有技師姓蔡。四川人。曾留學日本。今敎藏人製砲。藏與中國之關係。乾隆以後。滿大臣傅堪安曾帶兵入藏。助藏功尼泊爾。因尼泊爾與藏開戰也。結果尼泊爾敗。而進貢中國。岳鍾祺即定藏之名將也。近來因劃川邊之界。以康邊劃歸川界。藏人不服川。以兵入藏。藏人攻川兵。川兵敗而還。大抵以後中國專恃川邊之兵。不易平藏也。藏有常備軍。可續發兵兵數萬人云。</p>
<p>某方圖藏蓄志已久。今勢力已成。若中國希望。惟有與其人民聯絡。而改革政治。蓋今日藏民負擔日重。牛馬皆抽重稅。人有怨心也。僧廟極富。一由人死後好布施於廟。一由廟中放債也。藏地多黄金。其人以爲　。不知用之。藏出産少。只有羊毛麝香。余視其人種似蒙古人及漢人。而不似印度人。藏人尙有留辫者。</p>

<h3>英印棉業週訊</h3>
<p>▲孟買　上週期貨隨美棉下跌、廠需及出口亦不佳、上月底邊因投機售出、市勢最疲、惟旋即停止續跌、四五月期白羅溪交貨達一萬三千三百包、均爲某著名棉商所吸收、四月上旬因假期之故、營業稀少、最近奥姆辣及平果爾略有需要、白羅溪運輸不佳、本地廠家購買東非棉、歐洲需要平淡、日本紡織商意存觀望、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<p>▲利物浦　現貨問訊續佳、期貨方面、因多頭了結、跌勢甚銳、週末因埃及棉較好、略有零星購買、惟全世界紡織業情菜不佳、故人心依然向空、埃及棉市價先疲後回、</p>
<h3>糧食高白粳市仍見跌</h3>
<p>▲惟中關粳漸轉活動</p>
<p>▲閘北昨日内地到源計有三四十號、白粳米走銷高貨仍呆、價小半尺左右、中關以下各粳則因連日下跌引起一部份之店胃、交易忽覺活動、但行情仍續見降、約小敷分薄稻又小近角、羊杜秈埠秈本埠貨雖不厚、因銷滯小去角外、頂羊秈祇在十一元半上下矣、白元除特别貨外、餘均亦小尺許、</p>
<p>▲滬南　昨日本街走銷不佳、特頂高白粳極稀、而市高以下各粳則問津寥寥、晨午午間盤即小一兩角不等、至收市間因據北訊微軟、乃呈跌定之態、南帮薄早稻去化奇滯、隨短角餘、羊杜尖此間貨殊不充無甚變化、變元陰化到頭稍有、而吊飯兩銷平庸、行情步修角左、</p>
<h3>粉市又轉優勢</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午痱盤後、各月份市面、趨勢呈良好之象、以洋　報價、大致回漲二三四角不等、又以天津日銷現份較暢、每日達五萬包左右、價亦喊起二分、計三元一角二分、因此大部分人心、比較堅穩、尤以本月份之買氣、較爲盛暢、因兵船已可抽裝、較標準祇加七分半、所以實銷之胃口、更見活絡、遠期各月份因小廠仍有套出、漲度較徵、現後步本月份或因現銷關係、再好一二分、亦未可知也、結果本月份好二分、五月份好一分、六七月份好七厘半、八月份好一分、九月份好一分半云、</p>
<h3>期麥市態穩固</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、均見穩定之局、以洋　報價、又見回振、金價雖有盤頭、終在七百兩外、照環境而言、較月前似覺穩固、不過内地帮之心思、因天時甚止、買氣反不若前之熱烈、故形勢雖好、漲度則無幾也、結果本月份較前週好三分、五六月份好三分、七月份好一分、八月份不動、九月份好二分云、</p>
<h3>期豆餅步堅</h3>
<p>▲期豆　昨日標準大連豆初開即鑒連市之活　而紫切、各方購胃尙可、惟少數之獲利多頭及本埠號客兩帮仍有脫售與套抛、故情况雖呈堅穩、而價則未能過昂、上下午各月期大勢殊秀、交易所成交數甚鉅、是以豆市前途、須視連市及餅銷而定、收市結果較上週末計四六兩月期均爲四兩六錢半、大一分、五月芿四兩六錢六分、大三分、</p>
<p>▲期餅　内地帮已購進甚多、则團口之温州福建等帮手中頗厚、是以脚地殊隱、但目前外　不動、連電則稍告好、此間號帮抛意尚殷、　連申兩市尙合划耳、因此收盤交易帶稀、結果四月份大一分、五六兩月份大二厘半、七月上大半分、七月下大七厘半、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白步趨步升</h3>
<p>▲日車糖交易尙繁</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、仍乏到來、公會市場劃盤荷糖二十二號粗砂白買氣尙活、成交價爲十兩零三錢七分半至十兩零四錢、捍港貨十兩零三錢、略有成交、總額計有千袋之左、市形頗平、二十號中砂白九兩八錢七分半、交易較靜、日糖市亦微升、成交尙繁、Ｎ嘜十兩零三錢、ＴＭ嘜九兩九錢二分半、ＹＴ嘜十兩一錢七分半至二錢、ＹＰ嘜十兩零六錢、ＹＲＯ嘜九兩七錢半、Ｊ嘜十兩零七錢二分半、此前日步漲二分半至五分、而出户不多、市形殊俏、</p>
<h3>南北貨　龍口粉新貨將登場</h3>
<p>▲陳粉存薄回升</p>
<p>龍口線粉干前以走場呆滯、而地頭新貨正在製作、不日即可登塲、故申市一再下降、最小價曾到十九兩半、比前小去二兩之譜、茲據龍口函訊、新粉大約每包須二十六兩七錢、不能過廉、預計、旬後可以到申、成本划申價在二十兩零半、查此間行存已薄、而近日福州厦門均有動辦、故售盤乃見回升、昨市售十九兩八錢、市象穩秀、</p>
<p>]P&gt;絲茶　洋莊絲市益趨不振</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、續呈不振、緣外匯步長、歐美電轉、絲價益小、華絲本产佃難抛售、市氣沉寂、昨祇怡和等進滬白廠經十五包、高倍等進黄白組織二十二包、價均平疲云、</p>
<h3>針眉綠茶英銷活動</h3>
<p>昨日路莊土莊兩路之針眉綠茶、英莊怡和洋行、進意略活、全市成交三百七十餘箱、售盤與前相仿、婺源高莊珍眉綠茶、保昌洋行及華茶公司、亦有進胃、惟市面因疲滯已久、大盤又跌三四兩、屯溪歙縣等路珍眉、英法行家、均有談判、但未見有成交云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　各貨都呈向榮</h3>
<p>▲本廠棉市　邇來市面頗有蒸蒸日上之勢、昨雖報關業尙未開裝、但海外紗市有漲無跌、致國外去路大有紛至沓來之象、所以人心其佳、昨各價莫不上漲、細布漲五分左右、細斜漲一錢、粗布漲勢尤昂、湖北貨助嗣後有一度斷檔、亦未可知、因該地價格較滬市爲高、運申甚不合算、本埠各貨自三新停織後、出品大減、致呈供不應求、十三磅之飛熊、一牛頭昨俱已六兩一錢出關矣、粗斜趨勢亦硬、但去路較靜、各貨中細布最爲活潑、六月份亦已開罄云、</p>
<p>▲東西疋頭　市况昨日因金市上漲、人心轉挺、加以報關業花式貨今日有開裝之說、所以行家開價無不上漲、東貨之直貢呢莫干山獵雁一致三錢六分半、直貢緞續漲五厘、第一功爲三錢五分、四學士三錢四分、三友圖三錢三分、細嗶嘰因號家貨充斥、未能上漲、獨寳球須三錢八分、藍條色汀逐步上升、至昨紫金山寒山寺一致二錢三分半、四學士二錢三分、白縐布因天時關係、復趨平定、元洋　内地帮頗有採辦、點秋香爲十兩零七錢、一品十兩零五錢、西貨元西緞現貨甚缺、白條麻秒漸動價尙平定云、</p>
<h3>藍色呢絨銷場驟减</h3>
<p>毛貨呢絨、邇來市銷尙稱暢達、逐日向洋行打棧單出貨者頗形繁盛、近年中所暢銷之藍色呢絨嗶嘰、現在　塲驟形减遜、蓋其盛行已有四年之久、本客　諸　方需要突現退化、社會人心、似有喜新厭　之　、刻除藍閃華特呢及藍薄象皮雨衣布二種外、其餘若藍色花呢·嗶嘰·華特呢·法蘭　等、均無活動之望矣、</p>
<h3>油市白桐油春銷將動</h3>
<p>桐油至春令本爲旺銷之時、今庚因上年各處業務蕭條、故銷場亦减、白桐油素爲出口去路居多、自金價漲後、歐美各洋行以價難合算、辦者少數、市塲上難免减色、距一月前漢上適來源稍旺、市形不振、洋莊竟跌至十八兩四錢、旋因各洋行稍有動辦、復回高至二十兩○六七錢、現内地銷路將發動、本埠銷塲亦漸見活潑、惟來源久不注意漢桐、所賴以挹注者、厥惟杭桐、各號已向杭方辦到者數亦二三千擔、價每　須三十一元送申、較之漢上爲合算、聞杭州行家存貨亦不多、其金華·蘭溪·分水·桐蘆·嚴州·衢州等處各榨坊、均係隨榨隨售、向無多壧底積、故辦捐多、市面即上漲、</p>
<h3>五金　新鉛絲跌價二錢半</h3>
<p>▲青鉛定價奇軟</p>
<p>▲新鉛絲　十六號五二十五號市面、近因東貨進口踴躍、而出路甚少、故標準回跌二錢半、計十六號王二十號售十三兩半、二十一號王二十五號十九兩半、查昨日開出除零點綴較多外、大宗買買賣毫無、聞海外定價亦暴跌一鎊餘、故本埠標準恐難見回頭、</p>
<p>▲青鉛　近海外定價奇軟、致本埠標準亦隨之下游、計洋鉛祇估十五兩七錢半、土鉛十五兩四錢、比上週行情又跌三四錢、聞一般執　者因海外市氣虛弱、故標準頗有傾疲之勢、</p>

<h3>雲南問題</h3>
<p>— 湯彬</p>
<p>華企雲編著　大東書局出版</p>
<p>國人現今漸漸地注意於邊防的重要、這是使我民族振興的一種好現象、如日人的企圖滿蒙、英人的窺視西藏、都値得我們之加以研究、决不能將自己整個的國土被它國蠶飼、即如滿蒙方面偶有一種新的問題發生、日人的注意惟恐後人、則在它所屬的報紙上必大書特書、加倍宣傳、使全國人土引起特異的注視、激發他們研究的志趣、作政府野心耽視滿蒙的後盾、同時、政府方面亦派遣專員實地前往滿蒙考察實業的、調查富源的、每年更不下數十百人、至於關於滿蒙問題一類的專集、在日本實可算是汗牛充棟、由此、足見其注意我國邊陲如此、同時亦可知這等地它所佔之地位的重要了、在我國、直到現在才有一般人士顧及此項邊隅問題、關於滿蒙西藏一類採求的專集、也漸漸地發現於書肆、這當然、是値得我們加以叙述的、或可不使我國完整的國土有零星地落於它國人士之手、更使我民族漸趨於富强、這是全國同胞所希望的、固然、滿蒙西藏問題的重要、而雲南問題亦不可加以忽視、它在本部十八省中、面積雖係次大之省、但它形勢以及其它的重要、是爲任何各省所不及、有人以爲雲南邊　之地、何關大局、殊不知雲南據於各省的上游、有倒挈天下的形勢、這確可用地勢與歷史來證明的、</p>
<p>由雲南入川、是據長江的上游、過貴州至黄平沅江、以達湖南、是可左右北方、即如東走廣西、沿西江而下、又可據珠江流域、劉維担云、「中國如瓜形、而雲南則其瓜蒂也、瓜蒂濫、則全瓜濫矣、」這話實具有充分的眞義、且證諸史乘、亦正不乏其例、本書作者則在序文中所述、「昔蜀漢之世、諸葛武侯出師北伐、即先征南蠻、以絕後憂、唐之中葉、滇南没於南詔、中國遂苦騷擾、宋代懲唐之失、先征大理、南宋遂被併取、即如最近、民四護國之役、蔡鍔亦憑藉雲南一隅、始能再造共和、凡此者爲史中實例、非同響壁虛構可比、」實爲確鑿之語、接着作者又述、「雖然雲南形勢之重要、則亦全恃緬越以爲蔽、自緬亡於英、越併於法、雲南已覺藩籬盡撤、强隣逼處、滇越交界以大山大水爲多、尙能拒人於外、而滇緬之犬牙相錯、實屬無所依恃、所幸者、猶有野人山之天險、可以限隔中外、作爲天然長城、然而即此一地、英人尙屬不肯放鬆、必欲劃入其版圖而後快、清季之進佔片馬、最近之侵略江心披、皆爲英人侵略野人山顯著之例、野人山而爲英人所佔、則非特雲南脣亡齒寒、即比鄰之川藏諸省、必亦苦不安、在此千鈞一髮之際、若不廣爲宣傳、則將僅以懲以往越緬之失、」這都是金石之語、實堪我國人士的注意、客觀地以史地的實證來考察雲南一地、在目前、確有重視的必要、華君編著這、「雲南問題」一書、愼重推薦於讀者之前、亦爲不可遲緩的事了、</p>
<p>本書分上下兩篇叙述、上篇爲英法帝國主義與雲南、計有三章、一英法兩國覬覦雲南之由來、（甲）雲南在中國之地位、（乙）英法窺詞雲南之動機、二中英滇緬問題、（甲）英國之探險於雲南、（乙）緬甸之喪失、（丙）滇緬條約、（丁）滇緬續約、三中法滇越問題、（甲）安南之喪失、（乙）越南邊界通商章程、（丙）商務專條、（丁）界務專條、（戊）續議商務專條、（乙）續議界務專條、（庚）滇越鐵路問題、（辛）中法專約、下篇爲西南邊疆問題與雲南、計分三章、一滇緬西南北界務槪觀、二片馬問題、三江心坡問題、凡此種種、在討論雲南問題之中都屬於重要的、作者根據於史實作簡扼的叙述、亦爲我們一般民衆應該有以明瞭的、</p>
<p>雲南在中國的地位、無疑地是十分的重要、它的面積雖爲本部十八省中次大之省、然人口則爲十八省中次稀之省、關於此項、作者在本書裏有詳細的列表、以次欠比較、使我們能根據此點而能明白雲南在中國實爲廣土寡民之省、此種現象、非由於雲南的地　民貧、實因於僻處邊隅、而移民鮮少之故、但此地出産之足以稱爲富源、而陵駕於本部各省之上的、要以銅錫爲最、所謂土人、在此獲利頗豐、實雲南除地大之上、又有博物之實、然而一方面雖地大物博、他方面則屬人口稀少、在「地大物博、人口稀少」之情形下、每易遭野心者外人的覬覦、在我邊疆方面、早已不乏其例、如日本的窺伺南蒙東蒙俄國的伺隙北滿外蒙、即其實例、因此、雲南的缈起英法窺伺雲南、當然是必然的事了、</p>
<p>英帝國主義者對華的覬覦態度、是曲曲道來考其與法的窺伺雲南、决不是偶然而起的、實於遜清同治初年、時有法商奥塞及得張比諸人循江河潛游雲南、探測山川形勢、豐饒礦産、以後、又有法人杜沛者、自越南入雲南考察形勢、收貿銅錫、並有大礦學家勒格里率領學生游此、著雲南礦産考一書、後又由越南而假滇越鐵路侵入雲南、假此而又窺及廣西廣東兩省、可知其用心之險了、法之覬覦滇省、原冀此之利、在我人已知其叵測、但不知英人的深謀遠慮、較之法人殆有過之無而不及、考英國覬覦雲南的動機、以一言蔽之、則在「壟斷長江的商業」、這作者在本書裏所所述極爲明澈、英法兩國對華所締結與對越緬所締結用於滇越種種不平等條約、亦列有詳表、以使讀者一目瞭然、這實爲値得推頌的偉大的工作、</p>
<p>所以、作者在上篇裏、是以總合叙述爲主、舉凡英法帝國主義侵略雲南的歷史、與夫對華所訂關於雲南的種種不平等條約、都有作扼要的說明、現此篇裏、所具的唯一的特點亦爲此、堪以我們注重的、</p>
<p>雲南一省本來在從前有緬甸屏衛其西、越南屏衛其南、原爲天險之地、自緬亡於英、越併於法、所謂藩籬盡撤、强鄰逼處而界務問題、即由此而發生、作者有鑑於這一點、將滇緬西南北界務特提綱挈要分别敍述、在下篇裏、作者所述是以分析研究爲主、舉凡清季發生之中緬界務糾葛、以及有關西南邊疆的片馬問題、江心坡問題等等、無不作詳細的解剖、亦爲它書中所不易見之、其價値即可知的了、</p>
<p>在我國建設之始、凡我同胞、都希對於邊疆問題有以注意、此實關於我民族富强的緊要關頭、但以正確立塲來叙述此項問題的專書、坊問是很少見到、本書爲邊疆問題叢書之一種、作者前著滿蒙問題與西藏問題兩書、均爲重要之作、　近所出的這本「雲南問題」一書、更可作我人研究的參考、今後、關於邊疆的　况、如能引起一般人的重視舉切實的推究、那不得不推崇本書作者之力了、</p>

<h3>北行散記</h3>
<p>— 安平</p>
<p>八　十二小時的因緣</p>
<p>文章寫到這裏、我不能不回頭去追寫我在車廂裏的一件很有風趣的事情、</p>
<p>那一天的車、似乎很空、我車箱裏便不曾有第二個客人進來過、當四號早上、車已經過了徐州、我醒過來的時候、在朦朧中、自己的一號車箱裏彷彿多了人、我微微地睜開眼睛看一看、看見我脚頭站着一個少女、正在逗着一個小孩說笑、她們正看着窗外飛過的田野、背當了我、我那時眞的有了些窘、說給你聽你不相信、我這個人有許多地方眞有些童男似的害羞、我生怕她看見我、連忙閉上眼睛、不動、裝做還没醒、但是我心上却想起了許多事、我想怎樣才能使自己從容地起身、保持一個Ｇentleman的身份、不露出一些些狼狽、你想、一個還未老練的年青的男人、怎好意思在一個陌生的女人面前、穿起衣裳來、</p>
<p>眞是謝謝天、她不久就伴了那個小孩站到走廊裏去了、我像一塊石頭落下去了般不再心跳、將滑門輕輕掩上、這才慢慢地穿着起來、</p>
<p>茶房來代我打了盥洗水、接着、我上餐車裏去用了一點點心、</p>
<p>在餐車裏、東西已經吃完了、因爲坐在皮凳上看看野景也舒服、反正那時候餐車裏的生意並不忙、所以在那裏坐了長久、但是遲早總得回房間、想想在餐車裏坐得太長久了、也不像樣、於是祗得硬着頭皮踱回去、</p>
<p>當我走進我自己的一號車箱、她像正在舖上坐得無聊、我以最適當的身份與表情、微笑地和她點了點頭、她還了我一個禮、</p>
<p>我說、「上那去」、</p>
<p>「濟南」、</p>
<p>「徐州上的嗎」、</p>
<p>「是的」、</p>
<p>那時、正跪在舖上、臉貼在玻璃上看着景緻的小孩、回過頭來奇怪地望望我、我以一個大人的神氣向他笑了笑、但、與其說我向這小孩笑、還不如說是笑給個女子看好、</p>
<p>那個女子說得一口好京話、並且好像是很有身份的人家似的、雖然飽滿着爲北方女子所特具的一種英勇、但在那英勇裏却又含幾分南國美人的嫵媚、她說話很有禮貌、很有頭腦、而且來得乾脆、率直、爲江南女子所不及的那具有另一種風調的北方女子、第一個和我接觸的是她、第一個給我一個非常優美的印像的也是她、</p>
<p>那一次、我們談了許多話、雖然在興奮之中、也未嘗不想到、這不過像兩隻船、偶而在人海中擦過肩、同一段路、一霎眼就要分離、各走各的路、用不着那樣盡情奔放的、但、情緒來了、人無興奮、就全没辦法、那位女子也委實會說、彷彿什麽她都能和你談得上、尤其是在說到了什麽、她酒渦裏偶而泛出了上朶微笑的花、怪令人愛、</p>
<p>我們那次所以會談得極其多、多是由乎她這一個開塲、</p>
<p>她問、「貴姓」、</p>
<p>「儲」我說、「儲蓄銀行的儲」、</p>
<p>「府上那」、</p>
<p>「江蘇……宜興」、</p>
<p>她想了一想、像是思索到了一些什麽、說、「呵、你們是不是就是那個ＸＸ世家」、</p>
<p>（慚愧、我對於自己祖上的事、是素來不很知道得清楚的、以前也有一個人問我是不是ＸＸ世家、我自己還糊塗、不敢承認、那個人又問、儲大文是不是我的祖宗、我說對、可就不知道是幾代以上的祖宗了、他說、那就准是、但是到底是什麽世家、我仍然没有記清楚、忘了、那時她向我說這句話、在我的記憶裏、好像很合、所以說了對）、</p>
<p>在我們意料之外、她說出了這句話、那時、給我的感覺、是如下的兩重重一種宗法社會的門第思想、這一種思想給我的是驕傲、一種是她怎樣會知道這種事、這給我的是驚奇、</p>
<p>我開始對她迸生出一種尊敬的態度、我略略地知道了她一些身世、</p>
<p>她的原籍是安徽什麽府、也是世代書香人家、她說她家裏現在還有一付極舊的對聯、便是我祖上的一個什麽人寫的、她從小就受父親的敎讀、她父親是清朝的一個遺臣、現在是早死了、她並且還曾在南京一個女子中學裏讀過兩年書、</p>
<p>這一個開頭、事實上說明了她是一個知識階級、這是我們所以能夠談一許多話的最主要的一個動因、不過雖然以攀談家世而開塲、兩大部分談天的題材、仍然是滯留在五四以後一些事件上、</p>
<p>這天我們談得太好了、幾乎使她全没心思去理會她的小孩、小孩懂不得我們說的什麽、常常將一雙烏溜溜的眼珠望望我、我看不出他的眼睛裏有的是歡迎、還是恨、但是他大部分的時間仍然是費在看野景的一件事上的、</p>
<p>從徐州到濟南、約摸有十二個鐘頭、天亮到徐州、天黑到濟南、剛一整天、那天、我一直没有注意到時間跑得快或慢、我想、這一正天、單一個人躺在鋪上、靠幻想來應府寂寞、也夠可憐了、謝謝天、她却來調劑了我旅程上的孤寂、</p>
<p>我時常將自己視綫釘在她的臉上、這、在我、其實是没有什麽意思的、不過彷佛單就看看她的腹、也就夠使我忘了一切事似的而已、她不是一個美女、然而單兩個酒渦也就夠使她惹人看了、對、她祇要略略地浮泛出了一個笑、我便像喝了一杯葡萄酒一般的高興、我現在還能約摸記得出她的一雙眼睛是多麽花描、</p>
<p>但是我那麽將自己的視綫、死釘在人家的臉上、是一件失禮貌、很失身份的事、不過有時我不看她時、她又彷彿在偷看着我一樣、</p>
<p>這種情境是最有詩意、最有風趣的、雖然嫌風流了一些、</p>
<p>她的身材還完全是一個少女的身材、我想没有一個人敢猜她已經有了十八歲了、看上去、她頂多頂多祇該十七歲吧、一個母帶一個小孩、不怎樣使人感動、但一個大姊姊帶一個小妹妹或者小弟弟、便會令人迸出一種說不出、不能以文字來說明白的情調、</p>
<p>我想那個小孩子該是她的小弟弟、她對他很温存、很熨貼、不過我彷彿曾聽見那個小孩呌了她一次「媽」、難道她眞竟已是一個「媽」了嗎、我願意她還是一個小姐、</p>
<p>濟南到了、没有一種力量可以拉住她不下車、一個坐在三等車裏的她同來的下人、現在趕到二等裏來帮她提行李這樣、我在一個很神秘的點頭裏、送走了她、</p>
<p>但是我到頭還不知道她姓什麽、你說我這個人糊塗不糊塗、</p>

<h3>This Year's Financial Estimates</h3>
<p>Expenditures Still Require 600 Million</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain committee stated that the government's expenditures for this year are estimated to still require 600 million. Military spending accounts for 90%, while other government expenses account for only 10%. Originally, after the reorganization and disbandment of troops in various regions, military spending could be gradually reduced to 60% of revenue. However, due to the suppression of communists in Jiangxi, Hunan, and other provinces, it has not been possible to effectively reduce it. Customs revenue this year is expected to reach 400 million, but the world market is not good. Even if it cannot reach that number, it will undoubtedly exceed last year's 330 million. Last year's salt tax revenue was over 120 million, and this year it is estimated to reach 200 million. Although the new salt law may not be implemented smoothly for a while, after reorganization, it can be slightly more than last year. Therefore, the shortfall between this year's income and expenditures will be at most less than 100 million. Although there are numerous written and telegraphic requests for back pay from various armies, some cash can definitely be given priority from the new customs treasury bonds to make a show of support. It is heard that the government will transfer several million in cash from Shanghai to Beijing this Thursday or Friday. (Special Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Gao Jiyi Telegraphed</p>
<h3>Measures to Promote Domestic Coal Sales</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gao Jiyi, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to report that he had consulted with the North China Industrial Association and the Jingxing Zhengfeng Mines to determine measures to promote domestic coal sales and meet the needs of the Tianjin market. The bureau will dispatch trains to the Pinghan Railway to transport coal from the two mines, approximately 30,000 tons or more per month. The Tongcheng Company, commissioned by the North China Industrial Association, and the two mines will each be responsible for transporting 10,000 tons. In addition to the coal used by major factories of the North China Industrial Association, which will be supplied by Tongcheng, the two mines will be responsible for supplying the rest of the coal on the market. If it is not enough, they will find ways to transport more. It is also stipulated that the selling price in Tianjin by the three companies shall not exceed 11.5 yuan per ton for raw coal, and there shall be no restrictions on the quantity purchased. Coal merchants and vendors can negotiate directly with the two mines. The Railway Bureau will dispatch trains to the mines, regardless of who is the dealer. All empty trains going from Fengtai to Shizhuang to load coal may transport Pinghan goods to avoid wasting time. As for the coal used along the line from Tangshan to Tianjin East, because the Kailuan machinery is insufficient, the railway will use its own vehicles to transport coal for the merchants, charging current rates according to sixth-class freight. As for coal transportation from Kailuan's east and west sides, because the mine's machinery is lacking, only a few hundred tons are transported to Tianjin daily, and about 3,000 tons are transported to Qinhuangdao for export. There has been no suspension of transportation. There is no need to worry about a coal shortage in Tianjin. (Special Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>After the Resignation of the Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>Following the resignation of the Japanese Hamaguchi Cabinet, Wakatsuki, the new president, will succeed in forming a cabinet. The most notable thing today is whether to maintain the state of the previous cabinet, or resolutely carry out reforms as advocated by the Minseito Party. This is truly the primary issue facing the new cabinet. I recall that when Wakatsuki formed his previous cabinet, it was at a time when the Seiyukai Party, the Rikken Kokuminto Party, and the Seiyuhonto Party stood as three pillars. The Rikken Kokuminto Party was the government party, and the Seiyukai Party was the opposing party, with equal strength. The Seiyuhonto Party wavered between the two, wielding significant influence. If the Seiyuhonto Party broke away from the government, the cabinet would immediately be shaken. It was truly a difficult era to deal with. However, at that time, Wakatsuki succeeded Kato by order and also succeeded Kato as the president of the Rikken Kokuminto Party. He followed the Kato cabinet's approach and actively contacted the Seiyuhonto Party. At that time, the Seiyuhonto Party, due to its separation from the Doyokai, was at odds with the Seiyukai Party, and thus became increasingly close to the Rikken Kokuminto Party. The Wakatsuki cabinet's position was stabilized. However, later the political situation changed slightly. Wakatsuki sought to further stabilize the cabinet by wooing four members of the House of Peers Research Society and implementing cabinet reforms. As a result, the Seiyuhonto Party gradually became estranged from the government party, and Tanaka, the leader of the Seiyukai Party, seized the opportunity to cooperate with Tokonami, the leader of the Seiyuhonto Party, to overthrow the current cabinet. Thus, the Rikken Kokuminto Party cabinet fell into a dangerous situation. This is the history of Wakatsuki's previous cabinet formation. The situation this time is vastly different from the previous time. The three parties that stood as pillars last time are now only two parties in opposition. This seems to reduce a lot of conflicts between political parties. However, the enemy of the Seiyukai Party is still there. The internal opinions of the Minseito Party have not yet been reconciled. It is not easy to carry out reforms. Wakatsuki has already made the statement that it is natural to implement politics that adapt to the new situation, and that the Minseito Party's policies will not change, but the appointment of those determined before the current cabinet is not limited. It can be seen that he already has a grasp of the direction of cabinet formation.</p>

<h3>Spanish Municipal and Township Elections</h3>
<p>Republican Party Achieves a Great Victory</p>
<p>Public Sentiment Leans Towards Constitutionalism</p>
<p>The Imperial System Declines</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Madrid, 13th: In the recent Spanish municipal and township elections, although the Republican Party was subject to various obstructions and suppressions by the Imperial faction and the authorities, the results were a great victory. Therefore, after the vote count was announced, the minds of the people throughout the country were very excited this morning. It is estimated that in 40 of the 50 provinces nationwide, the Republican Party won a majority of the seats. Even in cities such as Pibao and Alicante, all seats in the city council were exclusively won by the Republican Party. Even in Madrid, the capital city under the emperor's direct administration, the Republican Party also held a majority with 92,000 votes against 33,000 votes. Even in the royal palace electoral district, the stronghold of the Imperial faction, the Republican Party held a majority. Although the Imperial faction also won some victories, such as in the Cadiz district where not a single Republican was elected, and in several places in Granada, the Imperial faction also held a majority, the national sentiment's trend towards republicanism is evident from this. Therefore, it is not known whether a strong reaction will occur immediately in the future. However, the rumors that the King is about to abdicate and that the royal family is preparing to move to England have not yet been confirmed. The Foreign Minister stated to the press this morning that the cabinet will meet this afternoon to consider the current situation. It is expected that a decision on a general resignation will be made at that time. Furthermore, Colonel Masia, the leader of the Autonomist Party, stated in Barcelona that the results of this election can be said to be a strong indication to the King. If the King stubbornly disregards this and attempts to rebuild a dictatorship, the time of revolution will not be far off, and its ending may repeat the tragedy of Louis XIV.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Madrid, 13th: The results of the municipal and township elections in various parts of Spain show that the Republican Party has won a great victory almost everywhere. In large cities such as Madrid, Santander, San Sebastian, Barcelona, and Valencia, Republicans hold an overwhelming majority. Even the most radical leftists opposing the imperial system said that this victory was beyond their expectations. The government has acknowledged the seriousness of the situation and the possibility of a political crisis occurring soon. The Imperial faction is now stepping up its efforts to preserve the throne.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Paris, 13th: The failure of the Spanish Imperial faction has greatly surprised the French press. This is because some secret agreements related to military actions have been heavily promoted by the Imperial faction in recent months, causing most newspapers to often dismiss reports of the strength of the Spanish republican movement as nonsense. Unexpectedly, today they suddenly saw its astonishing emergence. The French press now believes that this victory of the Republican Party will open a new era in Spanish history, and many speculate whether the King will make one last stand. For example, Le Echo states that if the King can abdicate to the young Prince Charlie at this time, the dynasty can still be preserved. La Paix claims that the election results clearly show that the monarchy has been collectively abandoned by the people. Le Peuple even concluded its commentary with the bold prediction of "Long live the Spanish Republic!" As for the Spanish exiles living in Paris, they are of course elated to see this result.</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Madrid, 12th: A large election of 100,000 local municipal councilors is being held here today. In addition to the 11,000 members of the Imperial Party and 1,400 members of the Republican Party who have already been elected without the need for re-election, approximately 87,000 municipal councilors still need to be elected this time. In order to promote public affairs among the people, the government has posted Article 84 of the election law in various places, stating that anyone who abandons their rights and fails to vote without a good reason will have their name published to serve as a warning. If current officials fail to vote without a good reason, this fact will be taken into consideration when they are promoted in the future. If they commit a second offense, ordinary people will be fined 2% of their annual tax payment, while officials will be subject to a 1% reduction in salary until the next election. The capital is currently in a state of election frenzy. Starting on Saturday night, leaflets were distributed using free cars, automobiles, airplanes, etc. Things were relatively peaceful on Sunday morning, but disturbances began to occur in various places near noon, especially in the Barcelona area. The situation became even more tense in the afternoon, with rumors that the "baseball bat party" intended to attack polling places and destroy ballots. However, this was prevented by the police and did not materialize. In many places, the enthusiasm of the people was so high that fire hose had to be used to dampen their fervor.</p>
<h3>Hamaiguchi Cabinet Resigns En Masse</h3>
<p>▲Land Minister Ugaki Submits Resignation</p>
<p>Wakatsuki Formally Assumes New Presidency</p>
<p>Minseito Party Campaigns for Cabinet Restructuring</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: As a result of today's extraordinary cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Hamaguchi and his cabinet submitted their resignations. Land Minister Ugaki, acting as Prime Minister, met with the Emperor at 11:17 a.m. to present the resignation letters. The Emperor stated that until a formal decree is issued, they should continue to diligently manage national affairs as usual.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: The joint meeting of members of both houses and councilors of the Minseito Party was held at 1:00 p.m. today, attended by 300 people. Secretary-General Sakurauchi read Hamaguchi's speech on his behalf, stating that the Prime Minister still needs to rest for a considerable period of time after leaving the hospital. Therefore, Wakatsuki was recommended as the new president. Hamaguchi's formal resignation as president was announced, and the election of a successor was held. Tomita immediately moved to nominate Wakatsuki, who temporarily adjourned for a break. Lai Mumu and Sakurauchi went to see Prime Minister Hamaguchi at the Imperial University Hospital to obtain his designation. The general assembly was reconvened, and Interior Minister Adachi read the nomination letter. Thus, the successor was decided. At this time, Wakatsuki rose to deliver his inaugural address amidst the applause of the audience, stating briefly that the Hamaguchi Cabinet had not yet lost the support of the people, but had to decide to advance or retreat due to an odious crime. This was extremely regrettable in constitutional politics. Due to the high integrity and great ambition of Prime Minister Hamaguchi, his retirement is a great loss to the country. This person, who has been elected as the successor, will naturally rely on everyone's help and make dedicated efforts. The doctrines and policies of the Minseito Party have long been clear, and they should be adhered to in order to contribute to national governance. Politics is a living thing. Adhering to established policies and adapting to various situations is indeed the key to politics, and one should not miss the opportunity to make the right decisions about advancement and retreat. Next, Tatsuo Yamamoto rose to thank former President Hamaguchi, shouted "Banzai" three times, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: After the decree to form a cabinet is issued, with the exception of Land Minister Ugaki, who is determined to resign, Wakatsuki will not force those who do not voluntarily resign to leave their posts. Therefore, a major reshuffle may not be carried out. The personal relationships between Ministers Machida and Tawarara and Wakatsuki, and the relationship between Minister of Education Tanaka and Minister of Colonial Affairs Matsuda and the party, cannot force them to bravely retire. Even if there is a restructuring, it may only change two or three key figures such as Chief Secretary of the Cabinet Suzuki and Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police Maruyama.</p>
<p>▲Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: In order to refresh public sentiment, the Minseito Party is launching a campaign to drastically restructure the cabinet and reshuffle the parliamentary secretaries when Wakatsuki forms the cabinet. There are two opinions regarding the cabinet restructuring. One is that the current formation of the cabinet is not a restructuring, but a new cabinet that has emerged after the resignation of the Hamaguchi Cabinet, and Wakatsuki should be free to choose cabinet members. Another opinion is that if a new cabinet is formed based on maintaining the status quo, it will absolutely not be easy to restructure in the future. Therefore, two or three cabinet members should be reshuffled, and incumbent powerful cabinet members believe that cabinet restructuring is an absolutely necessary condition for the Wakatsuki Cabinet to implement national policies.</p>
<h3>World Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>Geneva Accommodation More Expensive</p>
<p>May Be Held in Spain</p>
<p>▲Reuters News Agency, Geneva, 12th: The location of the 1932 Disarmament Conference seems likely to be Barcelona, Spain, rather than Geneva, as the price of accommodation and food for delegates offered by the city of Barcelona is only half of what is charged by hotels in Geneva. The Barcelona authorities have sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations stating that if the budget for expenses originally set for the meeting in Geneva cannot be offset by the total expenses of holding the meeting in Barcelona, the city of Barcelona can cover the difference. This proposal will naturally be welcomed by the League of Nations. In terms of weather, holding the meeting in Barcelona in February and March is indeed better than in Geneva.</p>
<h3>Italian Naval Experts Go to London</h3>
<p>To Continue Drafting the Naval Treaty</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Rome, 12th: Italian naval experts departed from Rome today for London to prepare for the continuation of the drafting meeting of the three-nation naval treaty on April 14. Therefore, local newspapers have unanimously issued warnings regarding France's attitude, urging that the treaty not be defeated at the last minute due to a change in one country's attitude.</p>
<h3>Cracks in the Australian Labour Party Widen</h3>
<p>Radical Elements Insult the British Emperor in Speeches</p>
<p>▲Reuters News Agency, Sydney, 13th: The signs of division within the Australian Labour Party are increasing. The new Labour Party organized by Australian Prime Minister Scullin and others in New South Wales has issued warnings to various labor groups, urging them to pledge allegiance to the new party before the end of April, otherwise they will be regarded as impersonating the Labour Party. Today, the radical faction of the Labour Party held a meeting here. He Ae, the chairman of the Northern Coal Miners' Union, used insulting language towards the British Emperor in his speech and praised the Labour Army. The Labour Army was decided to be organized by the Sydney Labour Congress, and its purpose is to resist non-Labour Party forces and use violence to counter violence. He Ae said that the current system must be uprooted, but bloodshed should be reduced to the lowest possible level. Furthermore, the radical element Ji De said in his speech that the Australian Labour Army must achieve something, like the Red Army of Russia. This is of course a revolutionary action, and all working classes must know that if they want to fight, the tool of struggle is not the ballot box, but the machine gun.</p>
<h3>Indian Troops Declare War on Mosquito Swarms</h3>

<h3>Central and National Government Weekly Memorial Services</h3>
<p>▲Central Party Headquarters: At 9:00 a.m. on the 13th, the Central Party Headquarters held the Weekly Memorial Service for the Premier. Sun Ke, Liu Luyin, Ma Chaojun, Yu Jingtang, Liu Jiwen, Gui Chongji, Chen Lifu, Zhang Qun, Cheng Tianfang, and hundreds of officials from various departments and committees attended. Sun Ke presided, and Liu Jiwen reported on the general situation of party affairs in Shandong, stating briefly that party affairs in Shandong began to be organized separately after the suppression of the rebellion. The party and government are in harmony, with a total of 5,400 party members. Among the 108 counties in the province, formal county party headquarters have been established in 14 counties, including Pingyuan. Those under reorganization include 69 counties, including Weixian. Nine counties, including Qufu, have established preparatory committees for directly affiliated district party headquarters. Four counties, including Boping, have established preparatory committees for directly affiliated district sub-headquarters. Special party commissioners have been dispatched to ten counties, including Jiyang County. Other counties have established preparatory committees or publicity officers for county party headquarters. Various counties do not pay much attention to publicity and training. The organization of mass organizations is loose, but funding is sufficient. After the takeover of Weihaiwei, a party headquarters was immediately established, and there are now more than 30 party members. The directly affiliated district party headquarters and mass organizations have also been organized and established. The Jiaoji Railway Special Party Headquarters has 264 party members, divided into three district party headquarters. The important task is to strictly prevent reactionary elements and publications. The Qingdao City Party has more than 350 party members and more than 900 probationary party members. The city is divided into six district party headquarters and one directly affiliated district sub-headquarters. The organization, publicity, and training have all been successful. Social organizations have all been organized, and the party and government are also cooperating, with no difficulties in funding. Most of the new party members are workers, followed by students. There is little activity, but reactionary publications have not disappeared. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<p>▲National Government: At 10:00 a.m. on the same day, the National Government held the Weekly Memorial Service for the Premier. Yu Youren, Wang Chonghui, Shao Yuanchong, Niu Yongjian, Wang Boqun, Ru Yuli, Song Ziwen, Ma Fuxiang, He Yaozu, Wang Zhengting, and staff from the two offices of civil affairs and military affairs, totaling more than 300 people, attended. Wang Chonghui presided, and Shao Yuanchong spoke about the mission of the nation, stating briefly that the mission of the nation has three aspects: (1) To protect the people, resist foreign aggression, and maintain social stability. (2) To nurture the people, so that all people can thrive under the principles of joint production and joint consumption. (3) To educate the people, so that everyone has the opportunity to receive education, so that they can exert their greatest efforts to seek social progress. China's international status is still unequal, and the powers still treat us with the attitude of the strong towards the weak. They do not know that the unlimited evolution of mankind comes from lasting international peace, and peace depends on mutual respect between nations. The ceremony then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting</h3>
<p>Report at the Weekly Memorial Service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>▲After the Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction</p>
<p>▲Attitude That Chinese People Should Take Toward Foreigners</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held the Weekly Memorial Service for the Premier on the 13th. Chairman Wang Zhengting reported on the attitude that Chinese people should take toward foreigners after the abolition of consular jurisdiction, stating briefly that the biggest obstacle to abolishing unequal treaties is consular jurisdiction. Now that the date of abolition is not far off, we should pay attention to what attitude the Chinese people should take toward foreigners after abolition. Chinese and foreign customs, languages, etiquette, and various other things are different, so misunderstandings and disputes easily arise. China is a country of etiquette, and treats people with courtesy in all interactions. During the Qin Shi Huang and Yuan Ming Dynasties, foreigners came to China to travel and were treated favorably by the Chinese government. In the eighteenth century, when maritime restrictions were greatly relaxed, the number of foreigners coming to China increased greatly. The motives of most of them, except for a few who were well-intentioned, were to seize the interests of our country. Since foreigners adopted this attitude towards China, conflicts arose from time to time. Lin Wenzhong's burning of opium was extremely reasonable, but foreign countries unreasonably interfered, leading to the Opium War. China concluded a treaty after being defeated, which was the beginning of China losing territory. Later, various countries followed suit and demanded the same, and concessions and leased territories continued to be established. By the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, China was defeated again, and its weaknesses were fully exposed. The countries then became even more reckless, and China was trapped under the heavy pressure of unequal treaties. Since China was conquered by foreign countries, foreigners in China became even more reckless, which led to the Boxer Rebellion. The change in the Chinese people's attitude towards foreigners, from friendship to hostility, was not the fault of the Chinese. Now that the time for the abolition of consular jurisdiction is approaching, should the Chinese people harbor a desire for revenge against foreigners after consular jurisdiction is abolished? This is fundamentally wrong. Our country has always been a country of etiquette, and will never take revenge on foreigners. Foreigners residing in China are guests from China's point of view, so Chinese people should treat them with the courtesy of guests. However, foreigners must obey Chinese laws and fulfill the same obligations as Chinese citizens. In the past, the Manchu Qing government, unwilling to have relations with foreigners, deliberately demarcated certain areas as foreign settlements. For the sake of convenience, everything within these settlements was left unattended, gradually leading to guests acting as hosts and the loss of sovereignty. Now, the Chinese people are aware of the drawbacks and unanimously demand the return of the concessions. Consular jurisdiction will soon be resolved, and the second step is to proceed with the return of concessions and leased territories. Chinese people have the right to live freely in foreign countries, so China should grant foreigners the right to live freely after it reclaims the concessions and leased territories. However, this right should only be granted after the concessions and leased territories have been completely reclaimed and foreign troops and warships have been completely withdrawn. It should also be subject to appropriate restrictions, following the precedent of various countries. From now on, interactions between Chinese and foreigners should be based on a spirit of mutual equality, so that foreigners will have no excuse to complain. The nation should pay attention to this point.</p>
<h3>President Chiang</h3>
<p>Participates in the Zhejiang Provincial Joint Memorial Week</p>
<p>▲Advocates Using China's Inherent Morality and Peace</p>
<p>▲To Achieve the Goal of Abolishing Unequal Treaties</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Party, Government, Military, and Police agencies held a joint Weekly Memorial Service for the Premier at the Provincial Party Headquarters at 9:00 a.m. today (the 13th). Party and government officials and staff from all sides, totaling about 2,000 people, attended. President Chiang arrived at about 9:00 a.m., and the ceremony began immediately. President Chiang presided. After a moment of silence, President Chiang lectured on the Premier's teachings, stating briefly that he had spoken here the day before, and that the focus of the National Assembly was on the Provisional Constitution and the abolition of unequal treaties. It must be known that this meeting is the key to China's survival, and all citizens should contribute their knowledge and ability. Speaking to this point, he read a section on the conclusion of nationalism from the booklet he was holding, saying that it could be seen from this that the Premier had instructed us to restore the position of the Chinese nation, and that it should be based on China's inherent morality and peace. Therefore, the abolition of unequal treaties should not rely on the courage of a single person in three or five minutes, nor should it adopt the xenophobic methods of the Boxers, which would only increase various obstacles and suffering. Now, the imperialists, seeing that the foundation of the Chinese revolution is gradually becoming consolidated, have tacitly formed a united front. Under these circumstances, we must seek survival from death, fight together, and diligently fulfill our duties with strong, persevering, and enduring spirit, and bury ourselves in hard work. Only then can we succeed. Since the Tang and Song Dynasties, China has been bullied by foreign tribes, and has recovered its national position with this spirit. Moreover, there are good examples in Zhejiang. In the past, King Goujian of Yue spent ten years accumulating resources and ten years teaching his people, and persevered through hardship, eventually achieving his goals. Although our country's position is now extremely difficult, if everyone can become self-reliant, it will not take ten years. As long as we are willing to work hard, without having to sleep on firewood and taste gall, we can abolish unequal treaties and restore the nation's position. If we give up on ourselves, we will be letting ourselves down. After this National Assembly, we will see which country is willing to give up unequal treaties, and that country will be our friend. The ceremony adjourned at 10:00 a.m.</p>
<h3>Labor and Police Unrest at Zichuan Coal Mine</h3>
<p>Jitong Correspondence: At the Zichuan Coal Mine of the Shandong Luda Company, a misunderstanding arose due to the mine police inspecting for smuggled coal, resulting in a conflict between the workers and the police. The mine police station arrested three workers. When the workers' demand for their release was not met, they destroyed the mine police station, resulting in a major unrest. The labor union demanded that the mine police apologize for firing without authorization. The mine police also demanded that the workers be punished. The two sides were deadlocked. The Department of Agriculture and Mines and the Provincial Party Headquarters sent personnel to mediate, but the matter has not been resolved. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Cause of the Incident: On the 27th of last month, workers Li Hezheng, Li Changxi, and Liu Zhahe from the Dakunlun branch mine of Zichuan were transporting waste rocks from the mine when they encountered guard mine police Tu Xiangliang inspecting for smuggled coal. A verbal dispute arose, resulting in a conflict. Li Changxi and the other two were arrested by the mine police station at the mine. When the Dakunlun labor union heard about this, it immediately sent representatives Guo Yunkun to the station to demand their release. Workers followed and inquired along the way, and more and more gathered. When they arrived in front of the police station, there were already hundreds of people. When Wu Zhensheng, the squad leader, saw the large group of workers approaching, he ordered the gate to be closed tightly. At this time, with so many people and diverse opinions, order was lost. They climbed the windows and knocked on the doors, making a great commotion. Some of the workers held sticks and stones to knock on the door. One person took the lead, and the others followed suit. The mine police inside did not know the situation outside, but only saw the windows broken and the doors torn, and stones hitting them. They fired shots into the air to stop them. At this time, the workers outside were pushing forward and backward, breaking down the door and entering. The mine police who had guns were afraid to fire them, and instead held the butt of the guns to resist. There was a chaotic scene, with bowls, cups, bedding, and mattresses thrown all over the ground. More than ten mine police officers fled out the door, and the workers triumphantly carried out the three who had been arrested. Afterwards, the mine police station inspected the damage and found three rifles damaged and two pistols missing. They immediately reported this by telephone to the mine police station. Deputy Director Huang Liyuan rushed to the scene after hearing the report, but the workers had already dispersed. Only Guo Yunkun and Liu Zhahe were captured within the mine. Li Changxi was arrested near the mine by the mine police who were on the scene. Soon after, labor union director Li Wencheng and others also rushed to the scene after hearing the news and had a verbal conflict with Huang Liyuan. Li rebuked Huang for not notifying the labor union, for not punishing the mine police for firing without authorization, and for re-arresting the workers. Huang said that the workers destroyed the police station and smashed the guns, so they should be arrested and investigated. The mine police fired into the air as an emergency measure. Both sides were angry and unwilling to yield. Huang then photographed the damage to the station and reported it to the company and the Zichuan County Office. Li also reported the firing by the mine police and the arrest of the three workers to the labor union for negotiations, and notified the County Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>▲Mediation Process: On the 28th, Yang Suwu, the manager of the Luda Company, arrived at the mine. Zichuan County Chief Meng Guanglu, together with the Public Security Bureau Chief and the County Party Headquarters Committee members, went to the scene of the incident for inspection. Then, they convened the Chinese manager of the Luda Company, Yang Suwu, the Japanese manager Song Xiang, the labor union directors Gu Chi and Li Wencheng, and others at the Coal Mine Club for preliminary mediation. The company and the mine police station demanded that the workers involved in the incident be punished according to law, that the lost guns be recovered, and questioned the labor union about its powers beyond those stipulated in the Labor Union Law. The labor union, on the other hand, demanded that the director of the mine police station, Huang Liyuan, and the mine police be punished for firing without authorization, and that the mine police apologize to the arrested workers and the company apologize to the labor union. The two sides were at extreme ends and could not reach an agreement. Huang immediately asked the County Chief to take the three arrested</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>Continued Important News</p>
<p>people back and detain them for punishment. The County Public Security Bureau Chief, because the three had already been detained at the mine police station for one night, and fearing that there might be torture, refused to take them back. He required the mine police station to officially send a letter to the county. In the afternoon, after the mine police station sent the three to the county, they were immediately bailed out by the County Party Headquarters and the Tiger Society. Because mediation was hopeless, the labor union immediately reported to the Provincial Party Headquarters, and the company also reported to the Department of Agriculture and Mines for review. On the 30th, Bureau Chief Liu of the Mining Bureau arrived at the mine. On the 31st, Lieutenant Colonel Lu of the Boshan Army High Regiment, Committee Member Li of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and Committee Member Gu Wenlin of the Department of Agriculture and Mines all arrived at the mine. They thoroughly investigated the facts of the incident on one hand, and engaged in mediation on the other hand. It was heard that the mediation conditions were that both the mine police and the workers would be released without being questioned, that the company would pay wages and medical expenses to workers who stopped work and were injured, and that the workers involved in the incident who disobeyed inspection and destroyed the mine police station should submit a letter of repentance to the company to express their remorse. Later, because the company was rewarding riots for the two items of suspended wages and injury costs, it refused to accept, while the labor union insisted that the mine police should apologize to the labor union. The distance between the two sides is still far, and it has not been resolved. It is now heard that the committee members sent by the province have reported the investigation and mediation situation to the Department of Agriculture and Mines and the Provincial Party Headquarters in detail. The Department of Agriculture and Mines has also formulated considerable measures for this matter, and it is expected to be resolved soon. (April 10th)</p>
<h3>Internal Division of the Red Bandits in Western Fujian</h3>
<p>▲Stalin Faction Massacres Social Democrats</p>
<p>▲Deng Zihui and Fu Bocui Slaughter Each Other</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After Zhang Zhen's division recovered the bandit dens in Kan City and Hulei in Yongding, Fujian Province, the Red Bandit Twelfth Army under Deng Zihui fled into the mountains. Yesterday, Zhang's division sent a victory telegram, stating that on the morning of March 28, the Red Bandits attacked Kan City, but were jointly attacked by the Yongding military police and local militia, resulting in the capture of 32 Communist bandits and the killing of over a hundred bandits. They seized 15 Mauser pistols, 65 rain capes, and 70 7.9mm rifles. The captured bandits were interrogated by Brigade Commander Wang and executed on the spot. Over ten heads were displayed in the Badun and Paitanzi Jiao areas. Furthermore, according to individuals from Yongding who came to Shantou, the Red Bandits in Western Fujian have experienced extreme divisions in the past three months. After Zhang's division recovered Longyan and Yongding, many local Communists successively repented and surrendered. According to reports from those who had reformed, the internal conflicts of the Red Bandits had escalated from divisions to mutual killings. Previously, the three counties of Shanghang, Longyan, and Yongding were held as strongholds by the Communist bandits, who possessed significant power. They established the pseudo-Soviet government of Western Fujian, directly under the command of the Third International. The party leaders included Guo Diren, Lin Yizhu, Fu Bocui, Deng Zihui, Zhang Dingcheng, Lu Zhaoxi, and Wei Wu, among others. However, these individuals harbored different ambitions. There was a division between the Stalinist cadres and the Trotskyist social democrats. Deng Zihui belonged to the Stalinist faction, centered around the Soviet Red Army in Western Fujian, while Guo Diren belonged to the Trotskyist faction, centered around the Red Army Military and Political School. The former faction consisted of bandits and thugs, while the latter consisted of young students, farmers, and workers. Guo concurrently served as the principal of the Red Army Military and Political School, where he formed a group to oppose Deng. When the plot was discovered, Guo and students Rao Bingkun, Lin Xiuhe, and Lin Kairong were arrested and executed by Deng. From then on, the struggle between the two factions intensified, leading to a sharp division. In October of last year, Deng Zihui led the pseudo-Twelfth Army and local Communists to attack Shanghang City. They engaged in fierce battles with the militia led by Wei Jiaren and were defeated by Luo, suffering heavy losses. Consequently, Deng accused Fu Bocui of ineffective combat and dismissed him from his military post, plotting to reorganize Fu's troops. In reality, Fu was a Trotskyist and was feared by Deng. After Fu was dismissed, Fu's troops remained scattered in Jiaoyang, loyal to Fu. Thus, the animosity between Fu and Deng grew. Deng, Zhang Dingchen, and others expelled Fu from the Communist Party. Shortly after, an assassination squad and a riot faction were discovered within the Red Army, aiming to eliminate cadre leaders and disrupt the Red Army's rule. Deng and others were greatly alarmed and determined that it was the work of the Trotskyist Social Democratic Party. On March 2nd, they launched a major purge, actively eliminating dissidents and establishing a Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Committee. It is reported that Deng successively arrested over a thousand social democrats, imprisoning and killing them. Therefore, Fu vowed to be irreconcilable with Deng, engaging in several battles. As a result, Deng was severely defeated, retreating to Baitian, Dachi, and Xiaochi. This time, when Zhang Zhen's division arrived in Yongding to suppress the bandits, Fu did not assist Deng, leading to the Red Bandits' complete defeat and Zhang's division's subsequent recovery of Yongding.

<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The Yucai Steel Plant, Yucai Machinery Plant, and Military Horse Farm were previously transferred by the Jin-Sui Garrison Headquarters to the provincial government for management. The provincial government, considering that the Yucai Steel and Machinery Plants were fully equipped and of significant scale, but had only been used to supply materials to military factories, deemed it a waste. Therefore, adopting suggestions from various parties, it was decided to convert them into production entities. The 12th meeting yesterday resolved to merge the two plants, transform them into commercial enterprises, and manufacture machinery needed for production. It was named the Minsheng Steel and Machinery Plant. Starting from May 1st, the provincial government will subsidize the plant with 10,000 yuan per month. As for the former Military Horse Farm, due to poor management and the lack of necessity for continued existence, it was decided to abolish it, with its affairs merged into the Model Livestock Farm for management. The remaining horse breeds will reportedly be distributed to livestock farms in various regions for breeding with private horses to improve the breed. (April 8th)</p>
<h3>Establishment of Harbin Municipal Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>▲Holding the First Expanded Memorial Week</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Harbin Municipal Party Headquarters was officially established at 10:00 AM today (the 6th) at the Governor's Office and held its first expanded memorial week. Previously, after Wu Tiecheng arrived in Harbin, he repeatedly discussed the matter with the designated committee members Zhang Jinghui, Zhou Shouyi, and Xu Zhen on the 4th and 5th, deciding to establish the Party Headquarters before Zang Qifang and Zou Shangyou returned to Harbin. The internal organization would be discussed further when Zang and Zou returned. At 10:00 AM on the 6th, the Governor's Office auditorium was properly arranged and slogans were posted. Leaders from various agencies who attended included Li Shaogeng, Acting Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway; Shen Ruilin, Director; Zhao Jinlin, Chief of Staff of the Railway Protection Army Headquarters; Ding Chao, Garrison Commander of Binjiang; Xing Zhanqing, Brigade Commander of the 26th Brigade; Wang Ruihua, Chief of the Special Police Department; Song Wenyu, Mayor; Chen Kezheng, President of the Special District Court; Bao Lian, Director of the Department of Political Affairs, and dozens of others. Civil servants from the section chief level and above, military officers from the major level and above, and principals of various primary schools, totaling over a hundred people, were present. Zhang Jinghui presided over the ceremony, and after the rituals were performed, the chairman reported on the establishment of the Party in the Northeast. Then, Wu Tiecheng was introduced to deliver a speech. Mr. Wu said, "Chairman, comrades, today, the Harbin Municipal Party Headquarters is officially established and holding its first expanded memorial week. Why are we holding a memorial week? Twenty years ago, many comrades, many martyrs, and many soldiers sacrificed everything to create the Republic of China as we know it today. We remember the hardships and sacrifices of the martyrs and comrades, which is why we are holding this memorial week. The Party affairs in the Northeast can be divided into three periods: (1) the secret period, (2) the period of cooperation between the late Premier and the late Grand Marshal Zhang in the tenth year of the Republic, and (3) the period of cooperation between Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Deputy Commander Zhang. During these three periods, many revolutionary comrades in the Northeast sacrificed themselves. Many tombs of martyrs and heroes in Guangdong also contain comrades from the Northeast. The revolutionary work of the comrades in the Northeast has a glorious and brilliant history and occupies an important page in the history of the revolution. Today, the Harbin Municipal Party Headquarters is officially established. I hope that all comrades will shoulder their responsibilities, train the masses, make them recognize the path, and have a clear goal to move forward." After the ceremony, a group photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned. Subsequently, Mr. Wu hosted a banquet at the Governor's Office, inviting leaders from various agencies, the press, and representatives from various organizations, totaling about a hundred people. The gathering joyfully ended at 3:00 PM. It is reported that Mr. Wu is scheduled to depart for Heilongjiang tomorrow afternoon. (April 6th)</p>
<h3>Anhui People Request the Formation of a Grain Management Committee</h3>
<p>▲Advocating Centralized Wuhu and Restricted Exports</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Rice is a major product of Anhui Province, and the rice market firmly holds the overall commercial hub of the province, as well as being a major source of tax revenue. Since the implementation of 　Li, the Anhui Provincial Government, in order to make up for military and administrative expenses, had previously imposed a fee on rice exports. However, due to strong opposition from various parties, and the central government also upholding the original purpose of abolishing Li, an explicit order was issued to stop it, and it was cancelled at the end of last month. Recently, a Grain Management Bureau was re-established, and a strict ban on rice exports was imposed, which has caused disputes. Rice merchants and various industries have sent a flurry of letters and telegrams expressing their opposition. In addition to rice merchants appointing representatives Gu Houfu and Tao Yinhuai, together with chamber of commerce representatives Wu Xingju and Cui Lianggong, to petition the provincial government, Anhui people Xie Jingping and others have now submitted a petition to the provincial government, proposing the organization of a Grain Management Committee for the Central and Southern Routes of Anhui Province in Wuhu, in order to centralize registration, restrict exports, maintain food supplies, promote Wuhu's market, and preserve local education and charitable undertakings. The original petition is recorded as follows: "It is found that the output of the central and southern routes of Anhui Province is mainly rice, and the main export goods are also grain. Since the implementation of Li abolition, grain is tax-free, and the miscellaneous transportation of sailboats cannot be checked. Therefore, four harms have arisen. There has never been a restriction on grain exports from Anhui Province. Whenever there is a famine, there is a rice shortage. In the nineteenth year, foreign rice was purchased and subsidized at a price of twenty yuan per stone. Lessons from the past serve as a warning, and repeating the same mistakes is cause for concern. This is the first harm. Along the border of the Yangtze River, there are many ports and wharves. In the past, there were Li donation bureaus, which could be slightly checked. If there is no registration in the future, the people will have nothing to eat. Temporary restrictions will be ineffective. Smuggling and circumventing are impossible to prevent. Even if you want to ban it, what is the basis for it? This is the second harm. Wuhu is the only commercial port in Anhui Province, relying entirely on rice for economic circulation. With grain tax-free, all cities can export, without being limited to Wuhu. Trade in commercial ports has plummeted. This is the third harm. In the past, rice donations were heavily surcharged, and charities and education relied on them for subsidies. Now they are completely abolished, and most local undertakings have stagnated. This is a major concern for politics and culture. This is the fourth harm. Therefore, to maintain food supplies, exports must first be restricted. To restrict exports, registration must first be centralized. This is why the Grain Management Committee should be organized in Wuhu as soon as possible. What is meant by restricting exports? The number of grain exports from Hunan and Jiangxi is limited annually, depending on the abundance of the autumn harvest, but Anhui does not have this. It is urgent to emulate it. Moreover, in today's world, domestic investors have mostly moved to better locations because of bandit troubles. Therefore, households have little storage and warehouses have no grain reserves. When exporting, they only aim to make a profit, not hesitating to transport everything away. There is no preparation between the harvest seasons. If exports are not restricted, there will inevitably be a shortage every year. For the people, there is no greater disaster than this. What is meant by centralized registration? The borders of Anhui Province have many waterways, and leaks must be blocked for easy inspection. It is urgent to concentrate the rice from the central and southern routes in one port in Wuhu. Exports are not allowed elsewhere, and registration should be carried out as a basis for restriction. Moreover, the area within 200 li of Wuhu is a rice-producing area. News of high prices spreads quickly, and thousands of sails gather in the evening. Information is readily available, and transportation is convenient, unlike the roundabout and difficult transportation. The rice market has been established in Wuhu for decades, and the rice from central and southern Anhui has naturally gathered in Wuhu for a long time. There has been no harm to the sailing transport, and the current restrictions will not hinder it. The above two factors can achieve three benefits. Without centralization, it is impossible to check, how can registration be done? Without registration, there is no investigation, how can restrictions be done? Taking Wuhu as the rice export port for the central and southern routes, the government, together with the local authorities, forms the Grain Management Committee to investigate and register. Once a clear number is obtained, restrictions can be imposed at the discretion of the authorities, so that there will be no harm to farmers due to low prices or harm to merchants due to high prices. This is the benefit of maintaining food supplies. With the concentration of rice and the prosperity of trade, finance will circulate due to the accumulation of progress, and the trade of all goods will naturally flourish. Commercial affairs and all government affairs can be implemented, and construction undertakings can be achieved. This is the benefit of prospering commercial ports. With prosperous commerce and flourishing businesses, tax revenues will increase daily. All local charitable and educational undertakings will also gradually progress, not only preserving what already exists, but also making cultural and moral progress daily. This is the benefit of preserving local undertakings. Since the founding of the Republic of China, Wuhu's market has declined, and all industries have been abandoned. It is not too late to save it now. At this critical moment, the rice issue has arisen. It is reasonable to submit this petition for adoption and implementation."</p>
<h3>Headquarters Announcement</h3>
<p>The Desperate Situation of the Red Bandits in the Jiangxi Territory</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Minister of Military Affairs, He Yingqin, has been in Jiangxi for nearly four months to supervise the suppression of the Red Bandits. In terms of military affairs, the 5th, 6th, 9th, 19th, and 26th Route Armies have extremely strong forces. At present, the scattered bandits in the rear have long been cleared. The general offensive against Zhu and Mao, who occupy Guangchang and Ruijin, began one day. The bandit-infested areas, such as Le'an, Yongfeng, Xingguo, and Yudu, have been successively recovered. Bandit dens such as Futian have also been destroyed one after another. Zhu and Mao's bandits are like fish in a kettle. Mr. He personally went to Ji'an by plane yesterday (the 9th) for an inspection. After returning to the province, in addition to issuing a statement, he also publicly announced the internal situation of the Red Bandits in Jiangxi and the progress of the National Army on all fronts, so that the general public would know the situation. The following is a record of the information obtained:</p>
<p>(1) The Strength and Occupied Locations of the Red Bandits in Jiangxi: 1. The 3rd Army, Huang Gonglue, has 7,000 to 8,000 men with over 5,000 guns.

They are currently based in Liangcun, Longgang Xu, and Gulonggang Jiangkou and are the elite of the bandit army. Xiang Ying is the chairman of the Red Bandit Committee. It is rumored that this army is also under the command of Li Jie. 7. The 9th Army, Wu Zhonghao, has over 4,000 men with 1,200 to 1,300 guns. They are currently based in Futian and Chenggang. 8.

They are based between Ganzhu and Guangchang and are currently fleeing south. 10. The 12th Army, Luo Binghui, has 5,000 to 6,000 men with 3,000 guns. They are currently based in Donggu and Yangmei Ling, and a large part of them are currently fleeing towards Ruijin and Huichang. 11. The 20th Army, Liu Tiechao, has 1,400 to 1,500 men with over 1,000 guns. They are currently based in Shangshe and Gaoxing, and part of Zeng Bingchun's troops are scattered on the west bank of the Gan River, lurking between Suichuan and Yongxin. The 22nd Army, Chen Yi, has over 3,000 men with over 2,000 guns. They are currently based near Ruijin, and part of them are in the Chenggang and Futian areas. The Reserve 3rd Army, Zeng Zhengchu, has over 1,000 men with 400 to 500 guns. They are based between Shuinan and Shacun and are reorganized from the Red Guards, with no great ability. (The above bandits are all east of the Gan River, bordering western Fujian. Currently, their northeast, west, and south are all surrounded by the National Army, attacking them separately.) 12. The 7th Division of the 16th Army under Kong Hechong, Kong Hechong, has 5,000 to 6,000 men with 2,000 guns. The 8th Division, Zhang Tao, has over 2,000 men with 700 to 800 guns. The 9th Division, Li Youjun, has over 2,000 men with 700 to 800 guns. These bandits have fled from Huangmao, Cihua, and Zhutan to Lishi, which belongs to Pingxiang. Recently, they have fled from Lishi to Gaocun, which belongs to Wanzai County. Small groups are still scattered in Youju and Ma, which belong to Xiu, and Huishi and Tianbao, which belong to Yi. (The above bandits are currently being suppressed separately by the National Army's Tan Division in coordination with the 18th Division's Zhu Brigade and the Independent 32nd Brigade. Kong's bandits have been repeatedly defeated, and their strength has been greatly diminished.) 13. Liu Dexin's force has over 1,000 men with 600 to 700 guns, lurking in the mountains of Futian and Jintian. 14. Liu Wanchun's force has 700 to 800 men with 400 to 500 guns, lurking in the Yongxin Sanxi Xu area. 15.

Recently, they have fled to Gaojia Xu and other places west of Anhe. 16. Li Mingrui's New 7th Army has over 1,000 men with 500 to 600 guns and is currently fleeing in Yongxin. Zhang Yi's unit has recently fled from Guidong in Hunan Province to Yongxin to join Li's unit. They were defeated west of Yongyang by our Luo Division, suffering heavy losses. (The above bandits are all west of the Gan River, looting and disturbing without a fixed location. They are currently being jointly suppressed by our Luo and Han Divisions in coordination with the Hunan Army, with considerable gains.) 17. The 10th Army, Zhou Jianping, has over 5,000 men with over 2,000 guns. They are currently fleeing in Guixi and Shangrao counties. They used to be based in Mount Mopan, but they have been repeatedly defeated in recent searches and suppressions by the National Army, suffering heavy losses. Their strength is now less than half. (The above is the bandit army in eastern Jiangxi. They are currently being searched and suppressed by the Ruan and Tang units and are nearing elimination.)</p>
<p>(2) The Cruel Situation of the Red Bandits: The methods used by the Red Bandits to massacre the people are too terrible to bear. In addition to beating, bayoneting, stabbing, and shooting, they would soak paper and cotton in kerosene, stick it to people's bodies, and set them on fire. They would also hang people upside down and pour boiling or cold water into their nostrils. In other counties, peasant bandits could arbitrarily arrest and kill people without the instructions of bandit leaders. Or even if they had paid to redeem themselves, they would still be arrested and killed. The bandit army has an organization called the "Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Committee," whose meaning is to eliminate reactionary elements. The people they designate to be killed are Kuomintang members, AB Group members, local tyrants, landlords, capitalists, intellectuals, and National Army officers and soldiers. However, those whom the bandits call capitalists are even families with only four or five acres of land, who are regarded as small property owners and are all on the list to be killed. Those whom they regard as the intellectual class are slightly educated junior and senior primary school students, who are also on the list to be killed. As for the National Army soldiers, they initially use benefits and sex to lure them to surrender, but ultimately mistreat them and slaughter them all. Furthermore, according to actual investigations during the forty days of Ji'an's fall last year, 13,882 people were killed by the Red Bandits, and 20,798 people were abducted. The details are listed separately below:</p>
<p>County   Number of People Killed  Verified  Unverified Number of People Abducted Verified Unverified</p>
<p>Ji'an   8,978 2,563 6,415 2,830 4,921 6,909</p>
<p>Yongxin  2,130 383 1,747 1,817 432 1,358</p>
<p>Jishui  1,700 279 1,421 3,900 506 3,394</p>
<p>Anfu   500 24 386 800 96 704</p>
<p>Taihe   178 61 117 1,402 252 1,150</p>
<p>Ninggang 200 22 178 500 9 491</p>
<p>Yongfeng 161 16 145 213 13 200</p>
<p>Wan'an   10 6 4 40 6 34</p>
<p>Suichuan 15 5 10 16 3 13</p>
<p>Lianhua  10 4 6 280 180 100</p>
<p>Total   13,882 3,453 10,429 20,798 6,418 14,380</p>
<p>Secondly, in addition to arson, killing, robbery, and rape, the Red Bandits' barbaric and bestial acts against women are even more appalling. However, the bandits still glorify this as "liberation." In reality, it is no different from a demon seizing and devouring people. Wherever the Red Bandits arrive, any widow or virgin between the ages of 16 and 40 is arbitrarily taken to a certain team or association and forced into free and equal partnerships. If they slightly resist, they will be killed on the spot. Or if their husbands are not at home, or if they are considered the wives and daughters of reactionaries, they are forced to remarry freely. If they refuse, they will be killed. Their staff members, in groups, break into people's homes and boudoirs, arbitrarily tease and engage in beastly acts. If they resist slightly, they are given the name of reactionary and brutally killed.</p>
<p>(3) The Political Situation in Jiangxi Province: Since Jiangxi Province was devastated by the Red Bandits, the people have been displaced and the cities and villages have been reduced to ruins. Most of the farmers in the bandit areas have been forced into the Red Guards. Since the National Army has been working hard to search and suppress them, the bandit areas have been gradually reduced in size, and the people's hearts have gradually become stable. Recently, the county magistrates have been ordered to cooperate with the military to organize sentry teams in the recovered areas within a time limit, to strengthen the people's self-defense forces. At present, the most important political work is to recruit refugees and stabilize the people's hearts, to intensify anti-Red propaganda work, and to organize people's self-defense organizations. Other tasks, such as the selection of county governors, the implementation of disaster relief in the bandit areas, the adjustment of food supplies, the distribution of agricultural tools, and the opening up of transportation in the bandit areas, are all being actively carried out. A Jiangxi Local Reorganization Committee has also been established within the headquarters to plan the political facilities and all post-war affairs in the recovered areas, to stipulate procedures, and to supervise the implementation of them.</p>
<p>(4) Recent Progress in Suppressing Bandits and the Confiscation of Bandit Weapons: The large forces of the Red Bandits, such as Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang, are massed east of the Gan River, taking advantage of the rugged terrain in an attempt to resist stubbornly. Since the National Army began its separate suppression operations on the first of this month, significant progress has been made in just ten days. The bandits in places such as Shacun, Shangqi, Da Feng, Gu Bi, and Luo Jia Xu have been successively defeated by the National Army, with many captured. The National Army's front line has reached Longgang Tou, Jiangbei Dong, and the line east of Yudu, as well as Chenggang and Donggu Mountain. In the Nanfeng area, the National Army's progress has been even more rapid. Since the occupation of important places such as Liaobi, Baijin, Gan Shan, Qiacun, and Shuinan, its front line has approached the Ganzhu and Changqiao areas near Guangchang. Because the Red Bandits have been repeatedly defeated, they have fled in disarray towards Ningdu, Shicheng, and Ruijin. As for the western Jiangxi area, Tonggu and Yifeng have long been recovered by the National Army, and the bandits in the Jiugong Mountain and Xiaoyao Mountain areas have been successively eliminated. Kong Hechong's bandits have been repeatedly defeated by the National Army in Huanggang Kou, Huangmao, Cihua, and Jiangkou, and their strength has been greatly diminished. Li Mingrui's bandits recently joined forces with the pseudo-Independent Division of eastern Hunan, Tan Sicong, and the pseudo-20th Army, Zeng Bingchun, and other forces to attack Yongyang in an attempt to relieve the siege of Zhu and Mao. As a result, they were defeated again by the National Army's Luo unit, with over a thousand captured. The remnant bandits are still fleeing like rats towards the border of Hunan and will be extremely embarrassed. As for the bandit forces in eastern Jiangxi, such as Fang and Shao, they originally used the Mount Mopan area as their base. They have recently been searched and suppressed by the National Army on all sides and were defeated at Mingyang Pass, with over 400 bandits killed and countless weapons seized. The bandits' schools, repair shops, and pseudo-governments have all been burned down. As a result, the coerced peasant bandits have fled in droves, and their situation is desperate and nearing elimination. Since the National Army began its suppression operations, it has seized more than 3,000 bandit weapons. Recently, Zhu and Mao have disagreed again, and disputes have arisen from time to time. Not only is the infighting extremely fierce, but even public accusations have been made, and there is a strong sense of tension. Luo Binghui, who was originally a strong figure under Zhu's command, has long been jealous of Zhu. Recently, seeing Zhu's extraordinary tyranny, he broke away from Zhu and set up his own banner. Zhu resented him even more and thought about eliminating Luo every day. Therefore, Peng Dehuai and Huang Gonglue, seeing that Zhu Mao and others' ill feelings were deepening day by day and that a civil war was imminent, were eager to find their own way out and agreed to surrender to the National Army. This is because the Social Democratic Party in the Red Bandits is very active in the dark, carrying out its means of sowing discord. As a result, the number of those who opposed Zhu and Mao also increased daily. The National Army learned of this situation and took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack, winning victories and capturing many. And many people are carrying weapons to surrender. In this situation, the elimination of the Red Bandits is not far away.</p>

<p>Resolution of Labor-Capital Dispute in the Used Clothing Industry: In Zhujiege Town, Second District, workers in the used clothing industry have traditionally not received fixed salaries, only a commission of half a li. Recently, due to the increasing cost of living, all employees in the industry felt that 3.7 li per yuan was insufficient to maintain their livelihoods. On the 20th of last month, they sent representatives to negotiate with the employers several times, requesting an increase in commission. The employers showed no sincerity in responding. Later, they sent a letter to the trade association, requesting a general meeting to be convened and petitioning the County Party Headquarters to instruct the town's chamber of commerce to mediate with the employers. The town's chamber of commerce took responsibility for convening both parties for mediation, and the result was satisfactory. The original commission of half a li has been increased to 4.6 li per yuan.</p>

The Wuxi Money Industry Association approved the letter, believing that this matter was of great importance to commerce. It immediately convened all members to discuss and unanimously agreed with Shanghai's proposal. It resolved to set the period from January 21st to January 30th each year as the preparation period for closing, January 31st as the final accounting period, and February 1st to February 20th as the investigation and consolidation period.

This spring, military police conducted repeated searches and suppressions, but he remained at large. Yesterday (12th), Xingsheng suddenly sneaked back home. The water patrol team stationed in Kongjiaque learned of this and was led by Deputy Captain Ge and Patrol Officer Shen Zugen to surround and capture him. When the bandit saw the military police coming to arrest him, he attempted to escape by wading through the water. However, Deputy Captain Ge shot and injured him, and he was captured.

<p>Banditry in Northern Anhui's Suxian County: Suxian County in northern Anhui borders Jiangsu and Henan and has the most bandits of any county. Sanbahou, a notorious bandit, previously gathered four to five hundred people near Jiagu and occupied the area for robbery and harassment. After repeated suppressions by the local militia, they mostly fled to Xishan. Recently, there has been no banditry. However, the bandit forces in the northwest of the county have become rampant again. The bandit leaders Zhang Chuanwen, Yu Keming, Zhou Laohai, and others recently led over a hundred fierce bandits to attack Tanshanwei. The stockade is located in the mountains and is a transportation hub between Suixi and Caili. The terrain is dangerous. The bandits attacked from the east, west, and south sides, very fiercely. The defenders on the east side saw the bandits' fierceness and were unable to resist, and there was a tendency to abandon the defense. Seven or eight fierce bandits took the opportunity to scale the wall and attack with guns. In a critical situation, the stockade leader Zhang Daolong ordered the stockade houses to be closely guarded and led people to fight the bandits in the streets. The bandits in the stockade were killed. At the same time, the nearby militia arrived after hearing the alarm and attacked from inside and outside. The bandits were defeated and fled, leaving over ten bandits dead and over ten bandits wounded. Over ten bandit guns were captured, and the bandit leader Zhou Laohai was killed on the spot.</p>
<p>Letters</p>
<h3>Letter from Lvcheng Elementary School, Danyang County</h3>
<p>To the editor of your esteemed newspaper:</p>
<p>Upon reviewing your newspaper's local correspondence column on April 7th, the article "Tragedy at School Sports Meet in Our County" stated that a student from our school was hit in the face by a shot put. This is inconsistent with the facts. The student was accidentally hit on the head by a shot put while he was practicing, but he did not suffer any serious injuries. He walked as usual at the time. The report that his facial bones were shattered and that his life was in danger is a fabrication by the contributor to mislead the public. We hereby send a letter of correction, hoping that it will be published in the "Letters" column to clarify the truth and conform to the facts. Lvcheng Elementary School, Danyang County, March 11th.</p>
<h3>Letter from Judge Gu Yushang, Changshu County</h3>
<p>To the editors of Shanghai Shen Bao:</p>
<p>I have read your newspaper's Changshu correspondence column on April 12th, which stated that the High Court transferred Judge Gu Yushang of Changshu to be a clerk at the Shanghai District Court because he was unclear about the case. The vacancy was filled by a prosecutor from Wujin Court acting as an agent. I have not violated any laws in judging cases, and the High Court has not made any transfer news. It is very surprising where your newspaper obtained this news. This matter is detrimental to my reputation, so I am sending a telegram to clarify and request a correction.</p>
<p>Educational News</p>
<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Life at Wellesley College (II)</h3>
<p>By Miss Lu Er Zhao, sent from the United States</p>
<p>(3) In this school, all staff members, from the president down, never look down on the working students. The black female workers employed by the school go home after lunch on Sundays. (The female employees of the school do not live at the school, they come in the morning and leave in the evening, like commuting students. In the morning, they greet each other with "Good morning," and in the evening, they say "Goodbye.") Therefore, on Sunday evenings, Er Zhao and Miss Xie work together to cook and bake bread to fill their stomachs. The cleaning and tidying of the bedrooms are done by the students themselves, every day, and this becomes a habit. The daughter of a wealthy capitalist also operates in the same way at the school, as a matter of course. So, the departure of the female workers has nothing to do with us. Every year, tens of thousands of American university graduates find it difficult to find a suitable position. When necessary, male graduates mostly work temporarily as clerks, such as waiters in restaurants and assistants in grocery stores. Female graduates mostly work as secretaries, accountants, and hairdressers. So, when we see young men and women in restaurants and stores serving attentively and behaving generously, we always pay more attention to them. The most valuable and unbreakable thing in the world is the element of self-reliance. During the student years, during the holidays or after school hours, one should seek a social position to practice one's abilities. Books are dead, and affairs are alive. Reading is for application and for doing things. If one only reads dead books, then one is just a book basket or a bookworm and not very helpful to society. To seek application, one must first seek employment. Employment must be regarded as equal, and one must strive for progress. In American families, housewives and their children mostly do their own cleaning, tidying, cooking, and clothing. First, labor costs are expensive and not easy to hire. Second, doing chores oneself can save money on materials. Children can also prepare for the world in the future. It is a good thing to have several benefits at once.</p>
<p>(4) American girls are very lively and have developed a habit of loving sports since childhood. Special rewards are given to those who enter university. The method is that only those whose scores in each subject are above 70 points (Grade C) are selected as players. Otherwise, they are rejected. Those who are not selected suffer great humiliation. Loving fame is a common trait of human beings. What is the pain in the hearts of those who love sports but are refused? For example, a child who loves snacks has snacks in front of him but cannot eat them. Others are eating them in front of him with relish, and this greedy child can see them but cannot eat them. What is his pain? Westerners call it the torture of the stomach. American girls whose scores are not full of 70 points are no different from being led. How can each subject not be diligently pursued? Also, the height of American girls is generally longer than that of our Chinese girls, but there is still not much difference. However, the hands and feet are very different. There is always a special feeling when shaking hands or holding hands. After swimming, when wearing shoes, one sees that the shoes of classmates in the same team are arranged in one place. In comparison, most are about one-half inch longer. It can be seen that women in that country use more strength and have longer thigh muscles. Physiological relations and habits are natural and cannot be achieved overnight. Our classmates here have never fallen behind in their scores in various subjects, but they always cannot take the lead in physical education. This is the cause of inner guilt, and they are working hard to strive.</p>
<p>The above four aspects are just a rough outline. Perhaps some say that American women have many strengths and no shortcomings? Er Zhao must answer that they are inevitable, but we are here to study, determined to take their strengths to make up for our weaknesses. We cannot but use a realistic approach to describe the general situation of our life at this school for the past six months. It is not our intention to be pretentious or to create something new. Yesterday at noon, it was raining and snowing, and the campus was all white. (December 19th at noon, which is about 10:00 PM on the 18th of the same month in our country.) Georgia, in the southern United States, rarely snows. Now, fortunately, seeing it, the students were all carrying their schoolbags, rejoicing and going crazy. They were trampling on snow, holding snow, dancing snow, throwing snow, and making snowballs, each enjoying their freedom. Er Zhao and Miss Wu also played in the snow for a while. In the evening, snow mist, the snow outside the window has not melted, so I wrote a rhyme to leave a footprint.</p>
<p>Remotely separated from my parents by 30,000 miles, studying alone in the Western Hemisphere, the rivers and mountains are all bright brocade, today the rain and snow do not fall in the Jiang Village,</p>
<p>Last year, my father also wrote poetry, my younger brother and I stepped on the snow, today, Georgia comes to appreciate the snow, I know my mother is longingly thinking. (The End)</p>

<p>Report from Beiping on the 10th: After the Sino-French Academic Expedition's crawling vehicles fell into the water at Shahe, they were originally scheduled to depart north the day before yesterday. However, because they were waiting for the French driver to arrive, they stopped there. Mr. Chu Minyi led team members to the site yesterday morning to inspect. The vehicles were still parked in the old city of Changping County. The Ford car that fell into the water and was damaged the day before yesterday was reportedly hired from Tianjin and has been repaired. It was driven back to Tianjin yesterday. The seven crawling vehicles are all intact and are scheduled to continue driving to Nankou yesterday afternoon. If there are no delays, they should reach Nankou last night. However, each vehicle flies a French flag at the front, and no Chinese flag is visible. It is said that academic circles are extremely indignant upon seeing this. After inspecting the site, Chu Minyi returned to Beiping at 6 PM yesterday. He is scheduled to negotiate with the French side tonight with Xu Bingchang and Ma Heng based on the original cooperative method and the principles discussed at the Antiquities Association the day before yesterday. If there is no result, the cooperative agreement between the two parties will be cancelled. However, because these vehicles are bulky, once they have set off, it is quite difficult to turn them back. Therefore, the Chinese side only requires the French side to abide by the Chinese side's restrictions and legal inspection procedures in the future. The Chinese team members will take the Ping-Sui train from Beiping to Zhanghuan and depart on schedule, it is said.</p>

<h3>Chinese Baseball Association Established</h3>
<p>▲Practice Begins This Wednesday</p>
<p>Baseball in Shanghai has always been underdeveloped. However, in previous years, the Chinese baseball team still had a considerable reputation and twice represented East China to win the National Regional Baseball Championship. Unfortunately, the person in charge was not his person last year, which led to the invisible disappearance. At present, the veterans on the sea have decided to retrain the new army and organize a team to promote it. A meeting was specially convened at the YMCA Sports Department at 5:30 yesterday afternoon. Because of the previous disorganization, it was decided to formally establish the Chinese Baseball Association. The staff will be elected at the next plenary meeting. If Westerners in Shanghai initiate a joint competition, they will send a team to participate. It is not to win, but to learn from each other's baseball skills and add a different color to Shanghai's naive Chinese baseball community. The first practice is scheduled for this Wednesday, the second is scheduled for Saturday, and three times a week thereafter. Those who attended the meeting yesterday included Lin Wencheng, Lin Wenfa, Wu Zhichao, Lun Jinchang, Chen Zhongle, Huang Zhonghui, Zhou Chongdao, Zeng Guangbang, Feng Chaoliang, Wu Zhenbang, Gu Degang, Li Baojun, Zhang Guoxun, Ren Jiexing, Ye Guihong, Pang Qingfang, Liu Dacheng, etc. All those with considerable skills in baseball are expected to join.</p>

<h3>Beijing-Ping Line</h3>

<p>▲The Tianjin Station Will Not Stop Temporarily</p>
<p>The Beijing-Ping line, which has been planned for a long time by China Airlines, has decided to start Beijing-Ping flights tomorrow morning (the 15th). The arrangement of the airport along the station and the installation of radio equipment have only not been completed at the Tianjin station. The rest are ready, so the Beijing-Ping flight will not stop at the Tianjin station tomorrow morning. The northbound plane will take off from Beijing at 8:30 and arrive in Xu at 10:30. It will arrive in Jinan at 12:30. The plane will fly directly to Beijing when it reaches Jinan Station, and arrive in Ping at 3:20 in the afternoon. The southbound plane will take off from Ping at 8:00, arrive in Jinan at 10:40, arrive in Xu at 12:40, and arrive in Beijing at 2:50. The entire route is 1,200 kilometers long and takes only seven hours to pass through the stations. The plane will stop for ten minutes at each station to load and unload mail. The Pingjin currently in Ping is needed for the southbound flight tomorrow morning. The pilot is assigned to Hao Zhonghe to drive. The Beijing-Jinan No. 2 is located at the Ming Palace Airport in Beijing. Zhang Huaiyi has been assigned as the pilot for the northbound flight tomorrow morning. The Xu and Bengbu aircraft were originally needed for the Beijing-Ping aircraft to fly against each other. They are currently being repaired in Shanghai and will soon be transported to the Beijing station for use. It is found that the aircraft on the Beijing-Ping line are all Steinson land aircraft with a load of 800 pounds (each pound is 450 grams).

<h3>Guangdong</h3>
<p>Aviation Status and Aviation Conference</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Liu Zhiyan's Remarks</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Zhiyan, representative of the Guangdong Aviation Authority to the National Aviation Conference (currently the acting principal of the Guangdong Aviation School), arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 12th and stayed at the Dongya Hotel. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency inquired about the recent situation of Guangdong aviation and his mission to attend the National Aviation Conference in Beijing. Mr. Liu replied that the Guangdong Aviation Department originally had the First and Second Air Squadrons. On the first of this month, a new Third Squadron was established. Given Guangdong's limited territory, having three air squadrons, supplemented by several Curtis Hawk fighter planes, the strength is not weak. In terms of civil aviation, the Guangzhou to Wuzhou route is already in operation. The Guangdong to Zhongshan County and Guangzhou to Shantou routes will also be launched soon. Regarding the school, the most recent graduating class (the fourth class) has been assigned to various squadrons. Additionally, eight individuals have been ordered by the Aviation Department Director to work in Hunan. These individuals will first go to Beijing for instructions. Currently, the school has one class of the fifth class and is continuing to recruit sixty students for the sixth class, who can enroll soon. This is a general overview of the recent situation of Guangdong aviation. As for my being dispatched to Beijing this time to attend the National Aviation Conference, I am accompanying Director Huang (Guangrui) to Shanghai. We will stay for a few days and then go to Beijing. I also plan to propose twelve motions, such as formulating aviation laws and regulations, establishing a national aviation meteorological system, night flight facilities, establishing a central aviation university, and mapping aviation maps. These are all crucial plans. However, convening the conference has even greater significance. If a second world war occurs, China will definitely be drawn into the whirlpool. There is no possibility of neutrality. The French General Foch even said that future world wars will be won by the air force. The status of the air force today is not what it used to be. How can we strengthen the air force? If we are drawn into a world war, we can also deal with foreign countries. We must plan ahead and be prepared. I am very optimistic about this conference, etc. It is noted that Mr. Liu graduated from the Aviation University in the United States and then from the Aviation University in Russia. His experience and knowledge are excellent.</p>

Now, it has been found that the cotton yarn industry companies have not deferred the freight fees for the transportation to the buyers. The union should order the members of the cotton yarn department to resume work first on a specific date to distinguish between the two industries. In addition to ordering the Cotton Yarn Industry Association to handle the payment of freight fees as before, this order is urgently issued to the union to comply without violation. Sincerely."</p>

<h3>Banking Law Does Not Apply to Native Banks</h3>
<p>▲ Yarn Industry Sent Letter to Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Directly Restricted in Native Banks</p>
<p>▲ Indirectly Affected Among All Industries</p>
<p>The Yarn Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, according to reports, Article 1 of the Banking Law passed by the Legislative Yuan states that those engaged in one of the following businesses are banks: (1) receiving deposits and making loans; (2) discounting bills; (3) remittance or negotiation of exchange. Those engaged in one of the above businesses but not calling themselves banks are regarded as banks. Although native banks are not explicitly listed, they are included. Banks and native banks are similar in behavior but different in nature. One determines the terms of a transaction based on the collateral and price of the person, while the other determines the standard for making loans based on the brand and credit of the person. One does not speak of sentiment in accordance with the law, while the other prioritizes sentiment and overlooks the law. Therefore, for hundreds of years until recently, those seeking commercial interests only knew whether native banks had resources and did not hear of banks providing emergency relief. For example, our yarn industry, with hundreds of companies in Shanghai, relies on native banks as the hub for business to develop. If the law is used to equate banks with native banks, then how dare the native banks assume unlimited responsibilities with limited financial resources? They will inevitably prioritize the law and disregard the habit of valuing credit and morality that has been cultivated over the years, thereby reducing the scope to pursue meager profits. Native banks will be directly restricted, and all industries will be indirectly affected. This is not to advocate for the financial industry, but it is related to the lifeline of all industries and cannot be kept silent. If this law is implemented without modification, the department stores and commercial activities in urban areas and towns will gradually decline, and there will be an unbearable day. All of our colleagues are uneasy. Considering that your association is the leader of the merchants and all members are well-versed in commercial conditions, they must have the same thoughts and feelings. They will surely report the situation and request instructions to protect all industries and revitalize the market. We hereby request that your association investigate and promptly submit the report to the Yuan, the Ministry, and the Municipal Government for review and implementation. With kind regards, etc."</p>

The ballroom of the restaurant was temporarily closed for one day for the large-scale banquet. Due to the large number of cars, there was no place to park, so the restaurant applied to the Municipal Council to temporarily borrow the racecourse as a temporary parking lot. After the banquet, the group returned to the ship to stay overnight. Today, they will travel to Suzhou and Hangzhou for sightseeing. This Friday, they will leave Shanghai on the original ship to inspect Qingdao and then return to Osaka.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Issuance of Tax-Exempt Transportation Permits for Homespun Cloth</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the competent authorities be instructed to issue tax-exempt transportation permits for the transportation of handmade homespun cloth, and to inform the customs to verify and release the goods. Now, it is learned that the chamber received a reply from the ministry yesterday, stating: "The telegram has been received. The case submitted by the National Taxation Administration has been examined. It is found that this case was previously submitted to the administration by the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Association and the Homespun Cloth Industry Association. The administration deemed that handmade homespun cloth, if made of cotton yarn on which national taxes have been paid, should be exempt from national taxes. However, for homespun cloth made of cotton yarn purchased in small quantities, the original tax receipts for the cotton yarn cannot be obtained, so it cannot be proved that taxes have been paid. In order to give special consideration to the difficulties of merchants, it is tentatively allowed that after the expiration of the period for exempting cotton yarn and its direct woven products from national taxes, they can apply for transportation permits in the same way as direct woven products holding the original cotton yarn tax receipts, so that the customs can verify and release the goods." The reply was sent to the association for information and instructed the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui National Taxation Bureau to comply. This order is hereby issued for your information.</p>
<h3>Surtax on Deed Tax for Local Autonomy Expenses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government, due to the shortage of local autonomy funds in the county, had previously proposed and resolved at the county administrative meeting to levy a surtax on deed taxes and other items to supplement the funds. The county government then submitted a formal document to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance for approval. The Department of Finance replied, stating that since the surtax on deed taxes in the county is not much, the request to follow the example of special construction donations and levy one yuan per hundred yuan of the sale deed price and five jiao per hundred yuan of the pawn deed price is tentatively approved. Therefore, the county finance bureau received an order from the county government yesterday, instructing that the surtax be levied according to the plan from this year onwards and allocated for local autonomy expenses.</p>
<h3>Slaughter Tax to be Collected as Usual</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued an announcement yesterday, stating: "In accordance with the instruction from the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office, it is hereby announced that before the office approves someone to take over the Shanghai slaughter tax, the tax payments for March and April should still be collected by the original committee member Fan Chunqiu as usual. Furthermore, Committee Member Fan stated in his letter that the slaughter tax for March and April has been ordered by the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office to be collected as usual, and there are also previous arrears. Please issue an announcement quickly and strictly supervise the collection so that the funds can be collected and remitted. Approved. Therefore, this announcement is issued. All households and individuals who are recognized as paying the slaughter tax must comply. It should be known that the slaughter tax is still being collected as usual. All previous arrears and taxes due for March and April must be paid quickly. Do not delay or wait and see, or you will be subject to prosecution. Each should respectfully comply without violation. Sincerely."</p>
<h3>Relaxation of Restrictions on Housing in the Chinese Area</h3>
<p>▲ Suspension of Crackdown on Residents with No Public Safety Issues</p>
<p>Since Zhu Xiaoyun submitted a report to the Municipal Government in the 18th year of the Republic of China, requesting the crackdown on second landlords who abused renting and overcrowding, which hindered hygiene, the Public Security Bureau, Public Works Bureau, and Health Bureau implemented measures to restrict the subletting of housing for civilians: (1) no more than three households in a single building; (2) no more than five households in a double building; (3) no more than six households in a triple building; (4) sun decks and kitchens shall not be converted into dwellings; (5) no mezzanine floors shall be added without the permission of the Public Works Bureau. Although these measures were approved by the Municipal Government, they have not been effectively implemented. In March of this year, the Fourth District Executive Committee of the Municipal Party Department again urged the Public Security Bureau to strictly implement the measures. As a result, the residents of the Chinese area complained that the Public Security Bureau did not care about the people's livelihood, and they did not know that the proposer of this case was someone else, and the Public Security Bureau was only the executor. It is now heard that the Public Security Bureau feels that the implementation is difficult and has a great impact on the livelihoods of civilians. It has discussed the matter with the Municipal Party Department again and again. As a result, a flexible approach has been adopted. The content is that the existing households rented before will be temporarily exempted from the crackdown if there are no public safety issues. If the original residents move out, the second landlord shall not recruit other households. Strict crackdown will be enforced only if they deliberately violate the rules. After receiving the order, each district has temporarily suspended the implementation of this case. Therefore, the issue of restricting housing in the Chinese area has come to an end.</p>
<h3>Summary of the National Calendar for the 21st Year of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>▲ Can be Requested from the Fourth Section of the Social Affairs Bureau by Letter</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to provide a basis for civilian-printed calendars, diaries, monthly calendars, and other books for the 21st year, reprinted twenty copies of the calendar summary compiled by the Astronomical Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, which were issued by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education. Previously, it was announced that the publishing and printing industries could claim them. In recent days, many bookstores in this city and other provinces have come to request them. Now, because there are still some remaining, those in need in this city bureau are allowed to request them by letter. Please include a self-addressed stamped envelope with the name and address of the requester, and they will be sent.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Urges Payment of Membership Fees</h3>
<p>▲ Otherwise, the Rights Enjoyed by Members Will Be Suspended</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent letters yesterday to the members of the Securities, Cured Meat, Rice Grain Sales, Seafood, Hardware, Embroidery Printing, Clothing, and other trade associations, as well as the Changfeng, Yili, Zhenhua, Jiangnan, Yizhong, Huacheng, and other shop members, stating: "Article 31 of the Chamber of Commerce Law promulgated by the National Government stipulates that the expenses of the chamber of commerce are divided into the following two types: First, administrative expenses, which are borne by the members in proportion to the number of representatives they send and the amount of capital. Now, the annual membership fee to be collected from each member depends on the amount of operating capital reported. Therefore, if the amount of capital fluctuates one day, the membership fee cannot be determined. Before the general meeting of members on June 21 of last year, although the members of each association and the shop members had paid some attendance fees, the standard for charging fees according to capital had not been decided by the general meeting of members, so it was impossible to determine the amount of fees. Therefore, the calculation was temporarily based on the number of people, with each association paying 50 yuan for each representative sent, and each shop paying 30 yuan for each representative sent. The amount of the shortfall was announced at that time, and it was stated that it would be made up after all the capital amounts were reported. In other words, the previously paid attendance fee is part of the membership fee for the 19th year. If any member has paid the attendance fee and believes that the membership fee has been paid in full, it is a fundamental error. This chamber has issued announcements repeatedly based on the above reasons to urge the reporting of capital with record. Now, it has been found that a small number of members have reported their capital but have not paid the membership fees that should be made up, and some have not even reported their capital. This is a lack of obligation that members should fulfill. Therefore, this letter is sent again to inform you that you must report the capital amount to the association within one week of receiving this letter, so that we can make up the membership fee. Those who have reported their capital but have not paid the fees that should be made up must also make up the fees within one week of receiving this letter. Otherwise, we will have to temporarily suspend the rights enjoyed by members in accordance with Article 22 of the charter of this association.</p>
<h3>Commander Deng Inspects the Wusong Fort</h3>
<p>▲Protecting the Fishing Season</p>
<p>After receiving instructions from the Ministry of Military Administration and issuing the newly compiled table of organization for the fortress, Deng Zhenquan, the commander of the Wusong Fortress, immediately began the reorganization, eliminating the old and weak, reorganizing various aspects, and reissuing new circular badges. At 9:00 AM yesterday, he gathered all officers in the department for a memorial week event. Then, accompanied by the Chief of Staff, Deputy Chief Adjutant Shen, several adjutants, he proceeded to the North and South forts and the Lion Grove Fort to inspect the large and small gun emplacements and review the artillery drills. In the afternoon, he continued to explore the lighthouse garrison campfires and other areas, conducting a tour for a week before returning to the department. It is reported that Commander Deng has strictly protected the spring fishing season at Wusong, as it is related to national tax revenue. He ordered his subordinates to pay attention to suspicious vessels to prevent bandits from infiltrating, and strictly prohibited tourists from secretly taking photographs of the fort. Violators, regardless of Chinese or foreign individuals, will be detained and dealt with.</p>
<h3>County Party Reorganization Committee Implements Work Plan</h3>
<p>▲The First Phase of Work is Completed</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Party Reorganization Committee formulated a temporary work implementation plan at the beginning of the 20th year and issued it to various counties for implementation. Shanghai County began work on January 13th. The first step was to conduct surveys of party members and society. The committee first studied survey methods, divided survey areas and personnel. From January 16th, committee members Lü Zhe, Tao Yishan, and Jiang Yanqiu, along with staff, conducted surveys in different areas every day. By February 8th, using open, secret, direct, indirect, and various other methods, and in accordance with various survey forms issued by the province, they had meticulously surveyed all party members in the county, as well as all organs, groups, schools, factories, special local conditions, and local figures, compiling various statistics to be submitted to the province. The second step was to re-divide the six district party branches and twenty-seven sub-district party branches into four district party branches, fourteen sub-district party branches, and two directly affiliated sub-district branches, based on the province's district division principles, the information obtained from this survey, traffic conditions, special local conditions, population size, and the ratio of party members, in consultation with provincial instructors. They also defined the activity scope of each district party branch and sub-district party branch, designated activity areas and targets for each party member, and assigned current activities. At this point, the first phase of the temporary work implementation plan issued by the province was completed. The committee, together with the provincial instructor, reported to the Party Reorganization Committee and received instructions stating that the work was diligent, the results were quite good, and it was commendable. It is also reported that all district and sub-district party branches in the county, by the 10th of this month, have been personally guided by three reorganization committee members to establish themselves one after another.</p>

<h3>Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Labor-Capital Dispute Resolution Law</h3>

<h3>The Municipal Party Headquarters' Stance on the Labor Strikes at Xiehua and Sanxing Factories</h3>
<p>▲Sanctions Should Be Imposed for Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>▲Assistance Should Be Provided for Losses Suffered</p>
<p>According to the Kuomin News Agency, regarding the recent cases of workers in factories such as Xiehua Silk Weaving Factory and Sanxing Tobacco Factory in this city going on strike on their own, a reporter from the Kuomin News Agency visited Chen Junyi, the standing committee member of the Mass Training Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters, yesterday to inquire about the facts of each case and the Party Headquarters' attitude towards handling these labor strikes. The following is a record of Mr. Chen's remarks: (The following is the statement of Committee Member Chen) It has been found that the workers of factories such as Xiehua Silk Weaving Factory suddenly went on strike on their own this time, without first going through legal procedures to request the Party and government organs to mediate, and without the approval or permission of this Party Headquarters at the time, which is inappropriate. Because the Party Headquarters protects and cultivates laborers and has the responsibility of guiding them, it will naturally try to increase the welfare of workers. If workers encounter difficulties or are oppressed, the Party Headquarters will give full assistance if they come to request it through legal procedures. Now that the workers of factories such as Xiehua Factory have gone on strike without going through legal procedures and without the approval of the Party Headquarters, they have put themselves in illegal behavior. This Party Headquarters will not only be unable to provide assistance but should also impose sanctions in accordance with discipline. Moreover, the labor strikes in these factories were not organized by the labor unions of the respective factories. I suspect that a few reactionary elements were mixed in and secretly manipulating and inciting the workers. Those who are not restricted by the labor unions and who independently go on strike without being directed or commanded by the labor unions, in addition to the fact that this Party Headquarters has sent personnel to conduct strict investigations, in the future, any workers in various industries who independently go on strike again without going through legal procedures, this Party Headquarters will consult with the government organs in charge to impose severe sanctions and will discuss and formulate measures to strictly punish them and will never be lenient. As for the workers of the French Concession Water and Electricity Factory who suddenly went on strike because of a trivial matter of dumping garbage and a conflict with the police, it was also a fundamental mistake. Because this time it was a personal quarrel between a worker and the police, it was not a labor-capital issue, nor was it the issue of all the workers, and there was absolutely no possibility of involving all the workers, and there was absolutely no need to strike. Such a strike is also illegal. However, since the workers were beaten and injured by the police, the Party Headquarters will, out of consideration for the workers' childish ignorance and lack of understanding, in addition to exempting them from further investigation, definitely negotiate to find a way to compensate for the losses suffered by the workers. If such incidents occur again in the future, severe sanctions will be imposed and there will be absolutely no leniency.</p>
<h3>Strike at Three Silk Weaving Factories in Hongkou</h3>
<p>▲The Social Affairs Bureau Conducts Mediation</p>
<p>All male and female workers of Xiehua, Yuhua, and Fenghua Silk Weaving Factories on Tangshan Road in Hongkou District went on strike on the afternoon of the 11th due to opposition to the wage cuts at Xiehua and Yuhua Factories. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to persuade them and scheduled mediation for this afternoon. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Reasons for the Strike: The Third Special District Silk Weaving Industry Union demanded that Xiehua and Yuhua Factories restore wages to 3.3 cents per foot, but mediation convened by the Social Affairs Bureau multiple times failed. On the morning of the 11th, a conflict occurred between worker He Agen and the manager of Xiehua Factory. Thereupon, the workers of Xiehua Factory went on strike in the afternoon. Workers from Yuhua and Fenghua Factories immediately joined to express their support, and the union immediately issued a notice stating: "Notice: Since the strike has occurred, all workers should wait quietly for the union to request mediation from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau. Do not riot to avoid accidents. This is important."</p>
<p>▲Authorities' Persuasion: After receiving the request from the Third District Silk Weaving Industry Union, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, due to the strike of workers, which is related to social tranquility, immediately sent Zhu Guilin to persuade all workers to resume work first and wait for a legal solution, and scheduled to convene labor and capital parties for mediation at 1:00 PM this afternoon. It is reported that all workers have agreed to enter the factory and resume work this morning.</p>
<p>▲Letter to the Public Works Bureau: The Third Special District Silk Weaving Industry Union sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession yesterday stating: "To the esteemed Bureau: The workers of our Xiehua Factory have reached a breaking point due to the factory's unreasonable reduction of wages and oppression of the workers. On the morning of the 11th of this month, at around 12:00 noon, the factory actually insulted the workers, which aroused public outrage. We were forced to announce a strike at 1:00 PM that afternoon. Tracing back to the cause, it was actually caused by the factory's severe oppression. Our union has already requested the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate in accordance with the law. However, during the strike period, we will strictly order the workers of the factory to maintain order and ensure that no accidents occur. Our union will bear full responsibility for the tranquility of the concession. We deeply fear that the Bureau will misunderstand, so we hereby issue this letter to declare and request that your bureau order the patrol room under your jurisdiction not to interfere in order to facilitate the labor movement. We earnestly hope."</p>
<h3>Various Industries Request Reduction of Business Tax</h3>
<p>▲Paint Industry: The Paint Industry Association, due to the business tax regulations issued by Jiangsu Province, which stipulated 20 per mille for the rosewood industry, submitted an electric request to the Ministry of Finance for approval and amendment, and it was reduced to 10 per mille. However, rosewood, from the time it is transported from production areas such as Siam until it is made into utensils, undergoes tax payment procedures four or five times. If 10 per mille is levied, the burden will inevitably be too heavy, and there is a difficult situation to maintain. The tax amount in Shanghai will soon be announced by the financial authorities. If it follows the tax amount of Jiangsu Province as a blueprint, then our wood industry will be on the verge of bankruptcy. Therefore, Du Gengsheng, Zhang Fukang, Zhou Shanqing, and Ling Youqiao were dispatched to the Municipal Government Finance Bureau and other agencies to appeal and report the situation to various ministries and courts of the central government, requesting relief in accordance with the law and approval to reduce it to 10 per mille as the highest limit. Yesterday, they received Approval No. 2821 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which is recorded as follows: "Shanghai Municipal Paint Industry Association, an electric report, regarding the business tax of 10 per mille levied on the Western-style wood industry and rosewood industry, please review and reduce it. The matter of the electric report entrusting the collection of business tax on the paint and rosewood industry has been stated to have been previously approved by the Ministry of Finance and should be complied with after amendment. You should still submit it directly to the Ministry of Finance for instructions." After receiving the approval, the association has prepared documents to appeal to various ministries and courts of the central government again.</p>
<p>▲Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry: The Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry Association submitted a document to the Municipal Government and the Finance Bureau yesterday stating: "A petition for the business tax rate on ginseng and bird's nest to exceed the provisions of the Ministry's regulations, please reduce it to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and maintain business. We secretly belong to the association that previously petitioned for a reduction in the business tax rate, which was not approved by (Your Excellency) (the Municipal Government), which is extremely anxious. Recently, I saw in the newspaper that (the Municipal Finance Bureau) has amended the business tax regulations, levying 2 per mille on Chinese medicine and 10 per mille on ginseng and bird's nest, which is extremely dismaying. I secretly investigate that ginseng and medicine are both things to treat diseases and are of great importance to the lives of the people. They are neither luxury goods nor are they subject to rectification. If 10 per mille is levied, it not only violates the provisions of Article 4 of the outline issued by the Ministry, but also ginseng and medicine are of the same category and are essential medicines for treating diseases. Ancient prescriptions use ginseng extensively, and even the new trend has medicinal pills such as ginseng regeneration. If the tax rate levied on medicinal materials is the same as that on ginseng and bird's nest, it is no different from deliberately discriminating. Taking a step back, if it is considered that ginseng and bird's nest contain foreign goods, then medicinal materials have never been without imported raw materials. Ginseng and bird's nest are essential medicines for treating diseases, saving people is the main purpose, which is even more important than grain, and should not be used in this way. The tax rate should not be increased. Moreover, Article 7 of the Ministry's Regulations on the Implementation of the Business Tax Regulations clearly stipulates that various business taxes, regardless of whether the business is domestic goods or foreign goods, shall be taxed at the same tax rate. Therefore, in terms of reason and law, ginseng and bird's nest should be subject to the same tax rate as Chinese medicine. It is reasonable to submit a document requesting that Your Excellency approve and instruct the Finance Bureau (Your Bureau) to sympathize with the suffering of the ginseng and bird's nest industry and to correct (correct) the business tax rate on ginseng and bird's nest, which should not exceed 2 per mille, which is a virtue. Presented to Zhang, Mayor of Shanghai Municipality, Cai, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Appeals for Exemption from Withholding Anhui Rice</h3>
<p>▲Telegram to the Central Government</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, regarding the Anhui Provincial Grain Inspection Office's obstruction of rice from leaving the province, believing that it hinders the people's food, sent a telegram to the National Government and the Executive Yuan, stating briefly: "The rice tax in Anhui Province was originally set up for rice and grain leaving the province. Now, due to repeated strict orders from the Central Government, it is impossible to stop collecting taxes, and it has become armed detention of ships, preventing rice and grain from leaving the province. Considering its intention, it is nothing more than to re-trap rice merchants and make them comply. The situation in this regard is probably clear. Wuhu's commerce has always been dominated by the rice market, and rice merchants in various provinces rely entirely on Anhui rice for supply. Now, detaining ships carrying goods will not only affect Wuhu's commercial market, but also cause panic among the people in various provinces that rely on Anhui rice for supply. At this time, when strict orders to cut taxes are repeatedly issued, the Central Government should have the power to balance how to rectify the discipline of various provinces that openly comply but secretly obstruct. Please first telegraph the province to release all the rice ships detained and not to extort them in order to maintain government orders and relieve merchants' difficulties."</p>
<h3>Xin Haishan's Injuries Are Severe</h3>
<p>▲Changhe Firm Has Hired Lawyer Wu to Proceed According to Law</p>
<p>At 9 o'clock, while passing the entrance of Pu'an Lane, Yongan Street, French Concession, he was suddenly shot by a Western police officer No. 158 for no reason, and the bullet penetrated his neck, causing severe injuries.

<h3>French Concession Court Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Nikkei Bank Case</p>
<p>▲Ye, Zhao, Zhou, and Chen Deny Being Directors</p>
<p>▲Seizure of Movable Property in Pharmacies and Bathhouses</p>
<p>▲Both Plaintiff and Defendant Sides Argue</p>
<p>▲The Judge Orders a Two-Week Adjournment for Further Hearing</p>
<p>The case of the collapse of Shanghai Nikkei Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings and Deposits was heard for the seventh time yesterday, focusing on the portion concerning the directors of the Gongfa Company. First, the lawyer Lu Shaozong, representing director Ye Shantao, stated that his client had a protest to lodge regarding the position of director of Gongfa Company. Upon investigation, Ye Shantao and the late Huang Chujiu were close friends. When Huang and Ye jointly organized the Nikkei Exchange in the 10th year of the Republic, Ye Shantao suffered significant losses, and Huang Chujiu was deeply apologetic. He promised to compensate Ye. Later, Huang Chujiu gave Ye Shantao shares worth 2,000 yuan. Subsequently, Ye received a call from Huang, stating that director Gao Qingtang was leaving Shanghai due to personal matters and wanted Ye Shantao to take over the position of director. At that time, Ye refused. Later, Huang entrusted Ye as a consultant, paying him a monthly transportation fee of 40 yuan. Later, Ye Shantao sold the 2,000 yuan shares to someone named Ge. From this, it can be seen that Ye Shantao was neither a director nor a shareholder. He requested that the case be dismissed. The plaintiff's lawyer, Dong Yu, rose to rebut, stating that Ye Shantao was indeed a director and shareholder, and there are records to prove it. If Gongfa Company had prospered, Ye Shantao and others would have enjoyed considerable rights. The denial of being a director and shareholder by Ye is strongly opposed by our lawyer, etc. The lawyer Zhou Xiaoan also stated that if Ye Shantao was neither a director nor a shareholder, why would he have a transportation fee, etc. Judge Gong Chengshen announced that the debate on Ye Shantao's denial of being a director and shareholder was concluded and would be decided later. The lawyer representing director Zhao Qinbo stated that his client, Zhao Qinbo, was a friend of the late Huang Chujiu and had helped him in various matters. Therefore, Huang Chujiu paid him a monthly transportation fee of 100 yuan. He was not a director. He requested dismissal. The plaintiff's lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stated that the defendant, Zhao Qinbo, was indeed a director and shareholder, and also a standing committee member. Therefore, the monthly transportation fee was as high as 100 yuan. There are accurate account books to prove it. How can he deny it? The lawyer Yan Luxiang also stated that if Zhao Qinbo was not a director, there would be no reason for him to have a transportation fee. Considering Zhao's status and personality, how could he help others for a long time of four or five years and take a transportation fee? The plaintiff's lawyer, Jiang Yiping, stated that Zhao Qinbo was neither a director nor a shareholder, and relied on Huang Chujiu's friendship to take a monthly transportation fee of 100 yuan. As the saying goes, "no merit, no reward." Huang Chujiu had friendship with Zhao Qinbo before, and there is no reason for him to have intentionally fabricated Zhao's director status on the shareholder register before his death, harming a friend later. There is written evidence, and the opposing party has not submitted any counter-evidence. The defendant cannot shirk his responsibility. He requested that he be ordered to bear unlimited liability. The judge ordered to wait for a ruling. At this point, the two accountants, Pan Zhaobang and Wu Zheng, rose to request that the director case be temporarily suspended in court. Our accountants have a special matter to request. Recently, our accountants received shocking news. Lawyers such as Wu Jingxiong, representing a group of creditors, requested the seizure of the movable property of Gongfa Company's Chinese and Western pharmacies and hot spring bathhouses in the Special District Court today, and it has been approved. The Chinese and Western pharmacy has already received a bid of 240,000 yuan, and the hot spring bathhouse has received a bid of 50,000 yuan. If there is a change on the part of the receiver after the seizure, the loss of the future prospects will be unimaginable. For the benefit of the creditors, we request that a way be found to stop it as soon as possible to avoid losses. The lawyer Jiang Yiping stated that although our lawyer is handling the case jointly with Wu Jingxiong and others, the request to the Special District Court was handled entirely by Lawyer Wu alone. It is best to ask the court to send an accountant and a bailiff to Lawyer Wu's office to find a way to stop it. Judge Gong Chengshen said that with the prestige of this court, it is impossible to send someone to beg Lawyer Wu to find a way, etc. As a result, Lawyer Jiang assumed the responsibility of accompanying Accountant Pan to Wu Jingxiong's office to find a way to stop the seizure. After they left, the court continued the hearing. The two directors, Zhou Songqing and Chen Xingwu, also defended themselves through lawyers, stating that their clients were not directors and that there was no definite evidence for the plaintiff's accusations. They also requested dismissal. The plaintiff's lawyer, Yan Luqing, stated that director Zhou Songqing was not only a director but also a relative of Huang Chujiu's family. How can he deny it? He requested a clear investigation. The judge ordered to wait for a decision. The lawyer representing Yuan Ludeng stated that although his client was a director, all decisions were made by Huang Chujiu alone, and he never obtained considerable benefits. Now that Huang's private property can be used as collateral, there is no need to seek compensation from the directors. The plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Zhigao, stated that since Yuan Ludeng has admitted to being a director, he requested that the case be summoned and questioned about the responsibility of other shareholders. This case can be easily resolved immediately. The lawyer Tan Yigong, representing Huang's family, stated that this case had previously been ordered by the court to hand over Huang's property for sale. Subsequently, our lawyer received the court order forwarded by the Special District Court and immediately transferred the property to the accountant. Unexpectedly, our lawyer recently received several letters from creditors, pointing out that our lawyer had not handed over Huang's property, etc. Our lawyer was very surprised. The creditors have different claims, either suing in this court or requesting provisional attachment of movable property from the Special District Court. May I ask whether this kind of behavior is legitimate? The plaintiff's lawyer, Xu Yannian, also stated that our lawyer also believes that the seizure of movable property by the Special District Court is inappropriate. I don't know what the intentions of the other creditors are. It should be investigated. Judge Gong Chengshen ordered the hearing to be adjourned for fourteen days.</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Suppression of Bandits by Land, Sea, and Air</h3>
<p>▲In Order to Protect Fishermen</p>
<p>Sea bandits outside Wusongkou are rampant. During the fishing season, coastal fishermen do not dare to go to sea and have petitioned the authorities to send warships to protect them. It is learned that the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Pacification Superintendent's Office, the National Coastal Defense Office, and the Wusong Water Police Fourth District have jointly established the Jiangsu Coastal Fishing Protection Temporary Office in Nantong. The province has allocated 20,000 yuan in funding and appointed Zhang Han, the chief of the Water Police Fourth District, as the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression, and Ding Moxiang, the section chief of the Coastal Defense Office, as an advisor. The office was established the day before yesterday. On the land side, Pacification Army troops under Liang and Pan, as well as county police teams from various coastal counties, have been mobilized. On the sea, naval warships Tongji, Shui Jing Ce Dian, Pingyang, Zhenhai, Jinghai, and other gunboats, as well as patrol boats of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Squadrons, have been mobilized, advancing on land and sea to encircle and suppress the bandit lair in Da'an Port. The headquarters has also dispatched seaplanes to assist, it is said.</p>
<h3>Chen Mutao</h3>
<p>The Truth of Embezzlement</p>
<p>▲Helping His Younger Brother Misappropriate Public Funds</p>
<p>▲Feared Understanding and Attempted Suicide by Taking Medicine</p>
<p>Chen Mutao from Jiahe, the deputy director of the savings department of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, suddenly claimed to be ill and entered the Shanghai Public Hospital a few days ago. At the same time, the bank discovered that he had embezzled 64,000 yuan in savings deposits and filed a complaint with the police, who moved Chen to the Municipal Council Hospital for treatment, pending a trial after he recovered. This has been briefly reported in this newspaper. The matter seemed rather strange at first, and the details were unclear. However, after the court opened the trial yesterday, the truth gradually emerged. Chen Mutao had served in the Zhejiang Industrial Bank for 14 years and had always maintained his integrity, which was valued by the bank manager. He was initially given the position of deputy director of the savings department. Chen was not only very sincere in dealing with people but also had a deep love for his younger brother. Because his younger brother had certain needs, he could not bear to stand by and watch. He then secretly misappropriated bank funds to help him, allowing his brother to be relieved of economic pressure. Chen was generous and would always help friends who asked for assistance, using funds misappropriated from the bank. This kind of behavior was equivalent to spending other people's money generously. Over time, he incurred a deficit of more than 64,000 yuan. His brother was unable to make amends, and he feared that once the matter was revealed, even with a hundred mouths, it would be difficult to obtain understanding. He would be ruined and discredited, and how could he avoid it? Ten days ago, he decided to commit suicide. On the first day of this month, he wrote a letter to the bank manager, detailing the process and purpose of misappropriating the funds. He stated at the end that he felt ashamed of his duties but regretted that it was too late. What face did he have to live in the world? He could only repay with his death. He begged the bank to consider the many years of working together and to refrain from pursuing the matter after his death. On the same day, he went to Wusong alone, telling people that he was going to the countryside for a stroll. He secretly bought two bottles of sleeping pills and took them with him. Arriving at Songjiang, he briefly toured the beach, planning to drown himself in the sea at night. He went to a beachside hotel for a temporary rest. When midnight came and all was quiet, he quietly left the hotel, thinking he could follow Qu Yuan. Unexpectedly, there were iron gates outside the hotel door, making it difficult to cross the line. Sighing at the ocean, his desire to die grew stronger. He returned to his room, drank all the poison, and went to the fence, wanting to get over it. However, as soon as he jumped up, he fell backward and fainted on the ground. He was then spotted by someone. By this time, the power of the medicine had reached his internal organs, and he had lost consciousness. People then sent him back to Shanghai and into the Shanghai Public Hospital. The previous report that he went to the hospital due to illness was a false rumor. The next day, the general police station sent detectives to the Municipal Council Hospital for treatment after the bank filed a complaint accusing him of embezzlement, in order to facilitate the investigation. Fortunately, the rescue was successful, and all the poison he had taken was removed. Yesterday morning, the police sent Chen to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Xu Jiaxue interrogated him. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the circumstances of the case and presented Chen's letter to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank for inspection. Chen also admitted to misappropriating 60,000 yuan and 2,900 taels of silver and requested leniency. Judge Xu then ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Xu Asan Falls from a Cart and Dies</h3>
<p>A cargo truck from a certain company was driving near the Xiangyun Road racecourse in Jiangwan at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. The truck was loaded with four or five coolies. There were few pedestrians and vehicles on Xiangyun Road, and the truck driver sped up and drove straight ahead at full speed. A felt hat belonging to Xu Asan, a Jiangbei man among the coolies on the truck, was suddenly blown off by the wind. Asan immediately asked the truck driver to stop, but it was not easy to brake immediately at full speed. Asan, being impatient, jumped off before the truck stopped, falling heavily, causing his head to be smashed and his brains to spill out. He died instantly. The truck driver stopped the truck, sounded the alarm, and reported it to the Local Court for an examination. Yesterday afternoon, the prosecutor and others arrived to conduct the examination and ordered the truck owner to prepare a coffin and collect the body pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Chu Shaoting</h3>
<p>Turned Back to Look at the Bandit's Face</p>
<p>▲Causing His Death</p>
<p>Chu Shaoting, a Henan native, is 31 years old. He previously served as a platoon leader under Zhao Jie, the commander of the Henan Garrison. Zhao was assassinated while in office a few years ago, and the troops were disbanded. Chu then returned to his hometown. He came to Shanghai last winter, wanting to seek a job with a friend of his former master Zhao. After arriving in Shanghai, it was difficult to find a suitable position for a while, and he temporarily stayed at the old master's residence in Hehefang, Xiafei Road, French Concession. He spent all the money he had brought and relied on loans from his fellow villagers or former colleagues to support his life as a traveler. Unexpectedly, at around 1:00 AM on February 20, Chu was walking alone in front of No. 248, Kaizi'er Road, west of the Great World in the French Concession, when he was suddenly encountered by a highway robber who blocked his path, showed a pistol, and threatened to rob him. They took off his leather robe. At the time, Chu did not dare to resist and allowed the bandits to do as they pleased. When the bandits were escaping with the stolen goods, Chu turned back to look at the bandits' faces and figures. The bandit immediately fired a shot at Chu with his pistol. The ruthless bullet hit Chu in the abdomen, and he fell to the ground. The bandit then fled. Later, patrolling police officers passed by and saw him and took him to the police station. Because he was injured, they could not ask his name at the time. The police chief ordered him to be sent to Renji Hospital for treatment before learning his name. However, due to his serious injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 6:00 PM on the 11th of this month. The hospital notified the police station, who carried the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch to examine it. It was determined that the deceased had died from a gunshot wound sustained during a robbery. They ordered photographs to be taken and allowed the friend of the deceased, Fei Liansheng, to prepare a coffin and collect the body, pending the police's arrest of the murderer for investigation.</p>
<h3>The Corpse's Face Did Not Change Color</h3>
<p>▲The Tragic Change in the Hou Family</p>
<p>▲Drank Tea Until Dawn and Died</p>
<p>Hou Chungen, a local resident of No. 12, Houjiazhai, Haige Road, West Shanghai, was 50 years old. He used to work as a handyman. He had a son named Jinfa, who is now 25 years old and not yet married. Jinfa lost his mother at the age of three and was raised by his maternal grandmother. In 1927, he went to a factory in Fengtian as a worker. He returned home last autumn and is now making a living by working in a foreign-owned flower garden near the Hongqiao Road airfield. His younger brother, Chunyu, is 42 years old and very fierce. He is currently a carpenter in a Dongyang factory. His wife, Ren, is even more shrewish. They have two sons, the eldest, Quansheng, is 20 years old and drives a car, and the younger, Quandi, is 17 years old and works as a shop assistant in a foreign firm. The two brothers live in the same house but cook separately. However, Chungen and his son were weak and often subjected to abuse by Chunyu and his wife, even treated like cattle and horses. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 6th of this month, Chungen suddenly died of a sudden illness. The next day, family members notified the deceased's son, Jinfa, to return home to handle the funeral. Jinfa saw that his father's death was strange and was suspicious, but he dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out. Moreover, his family was very poor, and he had no funds for any expenses. He thought that his deceased father had five fen of land in his name, worth about 2,000 yuan. The land deed had long been mortgaged by Chunyu. He then asked for it back so that he could borrow money for the funeral. Unexpectedly, Chunyu and his wife refused to hand it over and were unreasonable. Jinfa had no choice but to report it to the local police station. Police Chief Zhang Xiangrui went to mediate but was beaten. Ren also threw dirty things from the chamber pot at them. The police then took Chunyu and his wife, along with the deceased's son Hou Jinfa, back to the Second Division of the Sixth District. After a brief interrogation by Chief Liu, Hou Jinfa stated the previous situation. Hou Chunyu confessed that the deceased's wife had sent tea to the room on the evening of the 6th and did not know he was dead until dawn. However, the deceased's brother had 2.5 fen of land left in his name, and he was willing to pay for the funeral, but Jinfa did not agree. Chief Liu believed that the case involved a property dispute and was an insult to public officials. He transferred the case to the court on the 9th of this month for trial. The night before, Patrol Chief Zhang led the police on patrol to Houjiazhai. According to reports from the villagers, the body had not yet been buried and had recently been found to have injuries. Chief Zhang believed that the case was serious and reported it to the chief. Chief Liu went to inspect it himself out of prudence. He saw that the corpse's face had not changed color and that there were indeed bluish-purple marks on his chest. Fearing that it would rot and be unsanitary, he ordered the local guarantor Wang Zipei to report it for an examination. Yesterday afternoon, at around 1:00 PM, the court appointed Prosecutor Yang Qi to bring a coroner to the scene for an examination. The examination revealed that the deceased had died from poison taken before death. He ordered the deceased's son to prepare a coffin for burial, pending instructions. Because he had no money to buy a coffin, the Hou family raised money to pay for the burial, it is said.</p>
<h3>French Concession Municipal Council</h3>
<p>A Car Crashes and Kills Jiang Hongmei</p>
<p>▲Lawyers Argue with Each Other</p>
<p>▲The Judge Ordered a Recess to Wait for the Verdict</p>
<p>Li Xianming, a driver for the French Concession Municipal Council, was driving truck number 755 at the intersection of Lafayette Road and Pingjili Road, No. 119, at 3:00 PM on the 25th of last month when he crashed into and killed Hongmei, the six-year-old daughter of Jiang Wenhua from Chengli, De Renli, No. 9. Yesterday, the police sent Li to the French Court for questioning. First, the police chief from the car department reported the circumstances of the accident at the time. Then, the witness Shen Yongjian stated that he was passing by the area that day and saw the child being run over and killed by the defendant's truck's rear wheel. The defendant, Li Xianming, stated that he was driving on Lafayette Road that day and saw the child standing by the side of the road. Therefore, he continued to drive forward, not knowing how the child suddenly was run over by the rear wheel. The plaintiff, Jiang Wenhua, represented by lawyer Di Baike, stated that according to the defendant's confession, he saw the child standing on the side of the road. At that time, the defendant should have stopped at any time and waited for the child to cross the road before continuing to drive. The defendant ignored it and continued to drive forward, causing the disaster. He is undoubtedly to blame. In addition to this child, there is also a one-year-old boy in the plaintiff's family. The plaintiff's wife became ill with anxiety after her eldest daughter was killed. The two-year-old child also died from drinking the sick mother's milk. The situation is very miserable. The disaster was caused by the defendant alone. He requested that the defendant be prosecuted according to the law and requested 10,000 yuan in private compensation. The defendant, represented by lawyer Bahe, argued that the defendant, of course, apologized for the death of the plaintiff's child. However, in fact, the defendant was not at fault. The defendant's driver was driving very slowly that day. Although he saw the child standing by the side of the road, he did not know that the child suddenly walked out, causing him to be run over by the rear wheel. The defendant has been in office for many years and has never had any faults. The plaintiff's child was only six years old. How could he be allowed to walk in the middle of the road? The parents should bear considerable responsibility. Shanghai is densely populated, and there are many vehicles on the road. If the car driver had to stop every time he saw a person, traffic in Shanghai would be immediately cut off. This case should not only not be compensated for losses, but also be rejected. The Chinese and Western officials ordered a recess to wait for the verdict.</p>
<h3>Fire in a Printing Shop Burns Several People</h3>
<p>▲Two Apprentices Break Their Arms and Legs</p>
<p>Shuntai Printing Bureau, located at Nos. 789-790, Shunqingli, Qipu Road, suddenly caught fire around 5:00 AM yesterday. Instantly, thick smoke filled the air, and flames spread everywhere. The shop owner, Gong Rulin, his wife, children, workers, and others were awakened from their dreams and fled for their lives. However, the paper and ink piled in the shop were extremely flammable. In a blink of an eye, the stairs were burned off. Then, they jumped down from the windows of the building, with more than ten people injured and burned. The Hongkou Fire Brigade received the news and immediately drove to the scene to extinguish the fire. After about a quarter of an hour, the fire was slightly reduced. By the time it was completely extinguished, it was already dawn. When the fire was raging, the apprentices Ma Changgen, Yuan Yongchang, and Zhang Kunsong all jumped down from the third-floor loft window to escape, breaking their arms and legs and suffering serious injuries. The shop owner, Gong Rulin, his wife, Wu, and their children, Amao and Aying, were also injured and were sent to Tongren and Guangren Hospitals by the fire brigade for treatment.

<h3>Tailor Shop Burns Down Due to Carelessness</h3>
<p>Wei Yunchao, a Wuxi native, 47 years old, opened a tailor shop at No. 34, Heng Street, Yangjiadu, outside Dadongmen in Nanshi. At 12:40 PM yesterday, the stove room of the shop suddenly caught fire for unknown reasons. In an instant, the flames rose and quickly penetrated the roof. When the United Fire Brigade heard about it, it immediately rang the alarm. At that time, Wei and others in the shop woke up from their dreams and fled one after another, luckily without being injured. Soon, fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene with pumps to draw water for firefighting, which was extinguished shortly after. A total of one stove room was burned down. Afterwards, Du Sheng, the guarding police officer from the 10th post of that area, rushed to the scene and took Wei to the First District General Office. According to the confession, his wife was ill, and he ordered the apprentice to cook dinner. He understood that the sparks were accidentally lost in the pile of firewood, causing this disaster, etc. He was ordered to stay for investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Zhang Benquan's Whereabouts Unknown</h3>
<p>Zhang Benquan, a native of Anhui, courtesy name Hengcai, 55 years old, came to Shanghai from Hankou by boat a few days ago and temporarily resided in the Zhonghua Restaurant. He went out to visit friends the day before yesterday and suddenly disappeared. Zhang's family has been searching for him for days but has been unable to find him. Yesterday, they printed flyers and published Zhang's face, figure, and clothing, etc., and offered a reward. Anyone who finds him will be rewarded with 300 yuan. They also reported it to the police district and police station, asking them to investigate his whereabouts together.</p>
<h3>BL Society's Intimidation Letter</h3>
<p>▲Gu Xingsheng Remains Calm</p>
<p>▲Lin Amao Is Extremely Bored</p>
<p>Gu Xingsheng, a Suzhou native, 45 years old, lives at No. 102, Xiaopi Lane, and runs Gu Renji Silk and Satin Glue Workshop, specializing in dyeing plain fabrics for various shops. Because there are few such businesses in Shanghai, the profits are still high. However, Gu likes to raise birds and live a secluded life, leaving the workshop to his son to manage. In recent years, it has been smooth. Unexpectedly, he was targeted by bandits. On March 28, he received a threatening letter from the post office, extorting 2,000 yuan. It was agreed that at 10:00 PM on the 29th, the money should be delivered to the Xianshi World Beijing Opera Theater, and the person carrying the money must hold a white foreign bottle as a sign, and someone would come to contact him. The signature was "BL Society President Qi", with a rubber stamp. After receiving the letter, Gu Xingsheng smiled and dismissed it. On the 31st, he received another letter, again agreeing to deliver the money to the letterbox hanging on the No. 110 pole at the entrance of Chengzhili Second Lane, Yangjiazhai, Xinkaihe at 12:00 PM on April 1. It was explained that the package should be wrapped in red paper and a red paper strip should be pasted on the pole as a sign. Because Gu had no enemies in peacetime and lacked funds, he did not pay attention to it. Who knew that on April 7, he received another letter, saying that on the day of the previous agreement, he did not see him because of the rain. He agreed to pay the money at the same address at 12:00 PM on April 12. On the 9th, another letter came, with strong words, saying that if he did not fulfill the agreement, he would take appropriate measures. Later, the Public Security Bureau of the Second Division of the First District learned of the previous situation. Gu presented the letter and asked for arrest. Unexpectedly, on the 8th, another letter came, changing the agreement to deliver the money to the letterbox hanging on the No. 15 pole at the intersection of Yanhai Road and Zihua Road in Guangfu Temple at 12:00 PM that night. The Second Division of the First District, in conjunction with the First Division of the Second District, led police officers and waited several nights but found no trace. After strict investigation and reports, it was learned that the principal offender, Lin Amao, was hiding in the house at No. 5, Wangshengfang, Anrenli, Anren Street. At 3:00 AM yesterday, Section Chief Yi led Magistrate Ma and police officers to search and arrest him. The suspect heard the sound and tried to escape, but he was caught by police officer Man Zhaogan and taken to the station for interrogation. According to the confession, Lin Amao is 26 years old, a Ningbo native, with one sister and one younger sister. He used to be a machinist, but he lost his job due to a fracture in his left hand. He had no way to make a living, so he had this unrealistic idea. The threatening letter was indeed written by him. He used to be a classmate with Gu Xingsheng's son, so he knew the economic situation of his family in detail, but he had no accomplices. When he was arrested, a fake pistol and three rubber stamps with various forms of the BL Society were found. Section Chief Yi believed that the case was not that simple and sent it to the General Public Security Bureau for interrogation today.</p>
<h3>Accomplices in a Robbery Case Apprehended</h3>

<h3>Bandit Using Alias Still Arrested</h3>
<p>▲Jiang Zehan Is Wang Yaonan</p>
<p>The Second Division of the First District previously had several cases of highway robbery in the territory, including the robbery of postman Sun's silver, uniforms, the robbery of the Lu Fengho Exchange on Minguo Road, and a certain family's robbery. Wang Yunxiang, a habitual thief, was seized a month ago at Wangyi Malong, along with a pistol. He confessed that there was still an accomplice, Zhuang Zehan, a native of Daming, Hebei, who was at large. Wang was presented to the Public Security Bureau for handling and arrest warrants were issued for the fugitive. Unexpectedly, Jiang fled to his mistress's place in the territory of the Second Division of the First District to seek help. He was reported to the patrolling police officer by the mistress, who said that Jiang was a petty rogue. He was immediately detained at the station. After Section Chief Yi interrogated him, he found no evidence and sentenced him to three days of detention. Yesterday was the date of release. Chief Xu of the Second Division of the First District learned that Jiang was in the Second Division of the First District and was using the alias Wang Yaonan, a native of Anhui. He sent Patrol Officer Qiang and police officer Wu Jinbiao to bring Jiang back. Under interrogation, he confessed to the robbery and said that he had committed many crimes in the concession. The case is currently being investigated and the remaining accomplices are being apprehended, it is said.</p>

<h3>Barber's Suicide</h3>
<p>▲ Overwhelmed by Gambling Losses</p>
<p>▲ Ashamed of Brother's Theft</p>
<p>Bian Jinshun, a Yangzhou native only twenty-three years old, worked as a barber at Caitong Barber Shop, No. 434 Jiangxi Road. His younger brother, Jinli, was an apprentice carpenter at Xie Yongxing Woodworking in Zhabei. Jinshun was addicted to gambling, and all his earnings throughout the year were squandered at the gambling table. In recent days, his gambling urge intensified, but his luck worsened, resulting in substantial losses. Just as resentment was mounting and he felt helpless, he suddenly</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>heard the news that his brother had been severely reprimanded for stealing the master's property at the woodworking shop, leaving him even more ashamed. Last Saturday night, Jinshun was restless and unable to sleep due to his troubled mind. When he heard the morning rooster crow, he suddenly felt utterly hopeless and devoid of interest in life. He found a damaged electric wire in the room, hanged himself. By the time dawn broke, Wang Xiaosizi, his roommate, woke up from his dream and saw Jinshun's feet dangling in the air. He quickly untied him, but he was already ice-cold, his tongue protruding, and he had breathed his last. The shop owner, Zhou Yongcai, reported to the General Inspector's Office, which sent detectives to carry the body to the Forensic Examination Office on Fielun Road. Yesterday, Prosecutor Qian from the Special District Court, after inspecting the body, ordered the deceased's elder brother, Bian Jinan, to claim the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Li Xiuying Accuses Husband of Abandonment</h3>
<p>▲ Defendant Claims Non-Formal Union</p>
<p>▲ Judge Encourages Reconciliation Outside Court</p>
<p>Li Zhixin, a native of Yuyao, previously married Li Xiuying, a young woman from Ningbo, and is now accused of abandonment. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge of the Special District Local Court conducted a hearing. According to Li Xiuying's complaint, she married the defendant on the eighth day of the fourth month of the seventeenth year (of the Republic), and they had a very harmonious relationship. They have a son, Zhonghua, who is now three years old, and she is currently pregnant and will soon give birth. However, since the last quarter of last year, the defendant suddenly changed his behavior and abandoned her. The defendant works at Kodak Company, earning a monthly salary of over one hundred yuan. Mr. Wu, a colleague of his, mediated when they first fell out and arranged for the defendant to provide forty-five yuan per month for household expenses, but this stopped abruptly in January of this year. Recently, while she was visiting her mother's home for the holidays, he secretly moved all the household items away, treating her like a stranger, forcing her to file a lawsuit. In response, Li Zhixin claimed that his relationship with the plaintiff was a non-formal union, without the establishment of a marital relationship. He also stated that he was currently unable to make ends meet and asked the plaintiff to return to her hometown to live with his mother, and that he had not abandoned her. Judge Ge ruled that the case could not be self-prosecuted under the law and dismissed it. He also encouraged both parties to reconcile outside of court, giving them ten days to do so. If a reconciliation is not reached within the time limit, the woman should report to the police station, and the case will be reviewed after a public prosecution.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute on Gonghe Wheel Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the comprador Shen Huating of the British firm Jardine Matheson's Gonghe Wheel had an armed clash with eighty veteran workers in Wuhu last month, Shen resigned and has now been succeeded by Chen Bonian. The eighty veteran workers are members of the Seamen's Union. In addition, there are thirty-eight workers who are not members of the union but have been working on the ship for more than three years. Comprador Chen wanted to dismiss all thirty-eight of them immediately upon taking office, so the workers rose up in opposition. After repeated unsuccessful mediation by the Social Bureaus of Shanghai and Hankou, the matter was submitted to the Hankou Municipal Government for arbitration. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce also sent a supporting telegram, designating the Hankou Municipal Government as the competent administrative authority for the case, ordering it to promptly arbitrate and setting the 15th of this month as the arbitration date. Before a resolution is reached, the workers were ordered to continue working on the ship as usual and not to take rash action. Unexpectedly, when the ship returned to Shanghai from Hankou the day before yesterday (the 7th), Comprador Chen, after the ship left port, completely removed the nameplates from the thirty-eight workers' berths, immediately suspending their work. Unable to resist, the workers came to Shanghai in distress and immediately petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau to uphold justice. A discussion was held at the Social Bureau that day, and representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters also attended. Comprador Chen did not attend, only representatives from both sides of the workers attended, arguing for a long time without any result. They are waiting for the arbitration of the Hankou Municipal Government. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Hankou this afternoon, and arbitration will take place tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Cattle Plague Outbreak in Wangjiang, Anhui</h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Sends Personnel for Relief</p>
<p>Wangjiang, Anhui, is an important agricultural area in Anhui Province. Recently, a severe cattle plague has broken out. It is reported that over a thousand heads have died in the past month.

After receiving the news, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, noting that it produces a large quantity of cattle plague serum and that its efficacy is very great, sent personnel to inject the serum when cattle plague broke out in Shanghai and Zhenjiang, Jiangsu last year. The results were excellent, and countless cattle were saved. The bureau's cattle plague serum is usually priced very low, and free injections can also be provided when necessary.

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing in response to a news item in your newspaper's news column on the 12th of this month entitled "Recent News on the Day and Night Bank Creditors' Group (Requests Evidence of Bian Jialu's Repayment)," which is not in accordance with the facts. I am writing to request a correction as follows: My firm's employee, Xu Bingru (also known as Xu Jian), was suspended from his position on the 1st of this month for improper conduct. He left without waiting for the transfer to be completed, falsely claiming that he introduced 2,000 creditors for the Day and Night Bank and the Great World Savings Department's creditor registration, which was handled by this law office. It should be noted that this lawyer was first entrusted by the initiators of the creditors to handle the registration, and other creditors joined successively, all coming directly of their own volition. Xu served in the firm and could not have been the one who introduced them. He has no responsibility in this regard. Xu was hired on a monthly salary basis and had no right to share in the public fees. I am writing to request that your newspaper investigate and make a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Bian Jialu, April 13, 20th year of the Republic</p>

<h3>Xie Wuliang and Wuji</h3>
<p>— Qing Lin</p>
<p>Under revolutionary politics. There is a Control Yuan. Its organization. I won't elaborate. Examining its nature. It is the censorate of the Qing Dynasty. And the Office of the Censor during Yuan Shikai's time. Established specifically to clarify politics. And impeach high officials. The supervisors. Have been sworn into office. For many days. Among them, it seems that most are from Shaanxi. And Xie Wuliang is one of them. Xie is from Sichuan. Also a great writer in Sichuan. Many people today mistake Xie for a monk. This is a great mistake. Because the Xie family is not without monks. But he is an uncle. Not a brother. Xie's brothers are ten in all. All are outstanding. Wuliang is second. The third is Wuji. Dharma name Wanhui. He is a true monk. That is, the one that the world mistakenly identifies as Wuliang. Wanhui once studied Buddhism in India. His writing. Definitely has a little Bodhi nectar. Sprinkle the wonders of six thousand. Sometimes it is like a light cloud in the sky. Flying around the silent cold moon. Sometimes it is like a celestial horse galloping through the sky. Carrying mountains and surpassing seas. The so-called study of spirituality. Combining rigidity and softness. If he utters his lion's roar. He will immediately awaken the stubborn and deaf. Immediately put down the butcher knife. However, Wuliang himself. Is not ordinary either. At the age of twelve or thirteen. He lectured in Sichuan. Hundreds of people followed. Then his intelligence and courage. Can be imagined. If one only praises him as a prodigy. One is truly not a confidant of Wuliang. It is said that Wuliang is not good at Western learning. But by translating and looking up dictionaries. He can actually go on stage to give lectures on Western history. Is this not a heaven-sent writing talent? When he was stranded at sea. He rented a small hut in front of the county office. Earning a living as a beggar by selling his writing. Barely supporting his wife and children. As for the beginning of his rise to fame. It was when Mr. Sun Zhesheng was ordered to persuade the Eastern Province. To persuade Zhang Zuolin to form a triangular alliance. At that time, Wuliang was specially appointed as Sun's secretary. Using chopsticks as a metaphor. Assisting between the altar and the temple. Calm and leisurely. With many brilliant ideas. Never disgracing the monarch's order. His contribution was great. Therefore, although he has floated and sunk many times. He is now finally known in his time as the important position of Supervisor. Alas. Human power is superior to heaven. Learning is heaven-sent. Heroic times. One cannot do without. The world mistakes Wuji for Wuliang. It is nothing more than saying that the Xie family produced two monks. Although it is said that one son becomes a Buddha. Nine generations ascend to heaven. The more, the better. There is no malice intended. However, Wuji alone cannot be submerged. According to what I know. I will specially clarify this.</p>
<h3>The Jumping Over the Wall and Cooking Proposals</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>In Utopia. There is an organization. Spanning across the various cities. Direct level to the capital. The members of the group. Are all patriotic youth. Surveying the world at a glance. Politics are omnipotent. But writing is not their forte. My younger brother, Tao Zaixi. Once knew how to draft edicts with Lu Jingyu and Linghuzi. With a thin reputation for writing. So although he is old. He was still hired as a secretary. His monthly salary reached as much as hundreds of yuan. The livelihood of his family depended on it. One day, the group members reported on a wind disaster. Saying that there was a well in the group headquarters. Blown outside the wall by the wind. It was resolved to hand it over to the secretary to draft the document. My brother struggled to think. Fortunately, he was able to rationalize it. The general idea was that the group headquarters originally built the wall with wooden boards and bamboo fences. The corner of the wall was the well. On that day, the wind was too strong. Moving this fence inward. Passing over the wellhead. So for a time, it was rumored that the well was blown out of the wall. The group members all praised his wit. Another day, they reported on a diary. Saying that several members of the group. Were having lunch in the courtyard. Suddenly, in mid-air. There were several roast ducks hanging by the stove. Coming one after another. Eating them was very pleasant. It was resolved to hand it over to the secretary to draft the document. My brother also found a way to rationalize it. Saying that the neighbor was a restaurant. Just at the time when the cook was fighting in anger. Throwing the duck. Looking like it was flying. Another day, they reported on a flood. The resolution said. A boat loaded with stone mills capsized. Stone mills floated all over the water. This must be described in the presentation. My brother presented that the water rose to the trees. The boat capsized at that spot. The stone mill has a wooden handle. The handle has a vertical piece of wood like a hook for holding. The hook hangs on the branches. No different from floating water. At this time, Secretary Tao's name in official documents was greatly praised. However, the material was light and the task was heavy. Heaven could not be relied on repeatedly. Before long, my brother's end had come. One day, the group discussed a parade. The route passed through a narrow lane. The lane was blocked by a high wall of considerable height. Some suggested opening a hole in the wall to pass. Opponents said that it was close to exploitation. Not possible. Some suggested detouring. Opponents said that it violated the original intention. Also not possible. Some suggested demolishing the wall. Opponents said. This group has creation. No destruction. Moreover, there is no money for demolition. While they were discussing. The leader suggested. There are no difficult words in the dictionary. When the time comes, the entire group will set off. With a great spirit of fearlessness. Demolishing the spirit of non-compromise. Everyone will jump over. At this time, the entire scene was tense. Unanimously agreed to pass. Handed over to the secretary to draft a notice to join the parading agency. Three days later, he could not hand in the paper. The leader was furious. My brother said. Dead ducks fly into the hands of the living. The wellhead moves to the movable wall. As for the stone mill, a handle-less shutter sinks. I am ashamed that my statement only fulfills half of it. Now, the jumping over the wall proposal. The grammar is to this point. Playing is exhausted. The only thing left is to pack up and leave. Returning and meeting my other brother, Tao Zainan. Also returned after resigning from another similar organization. Startled and asked. Zainan said. My brother was denounced for jumping over the wall. I was destroyed by the cooking proposal. Because my group discussed this case. Investigation-style must be used. Also clearly stating the law of cause and effect. The so-called scientific method. I followed the steaming of rice. Cooking rice. Pot rice. Immortal rice. The types are like eight-treasure rice and egg fried rice. Northern wheat rice. The time of death, such as breakfast, lunch, and dinner, are investigated in detail. Sending the draft after three days was not okay. There was a result but no cause. Before the rice was rice. Rice is like Gao Xianjian, the cover of Gao Baixianjing, and other types. Fortunately, there is a rice market to inquire about. Listed as a table. Sending the draft again after three days was still not okay. There is still a cause for rice. So before the rice was grain. Before the grain was rice. Before the rice was seedlings. Before the seedlings, one seed-by-seed was listed in the same way. Still not okay. The source of the seed must be traced before it is thorough. Before the seed, it is rice and grain. The cycle of inquiry. Even the righteous Shennong Houzhong could not find the cause. This is why I broke my rice bowl. So we sighed in front of each other. Changing the industry to peddlers.</p>
<h3>Remembering Zhang Baosan</h3>
<p>— Zhan Zhan</p>
<p>Old friend Wang Yanshi from Kunshan. Wrote the eight volumes of the Suihantang Anthology. Among them, there is a story about Zhang Baosan. Quite strange and interesting. It is a pity that the text is too long. Cannot be fully recorded. Extract the main points. To fulfill this talk. To give to the reader.</p>
<p>An'ting Town in Jiading County. Mr. Gui Zhenchuan of the Ming Dynasty. Once studied in that place. During the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty. There was a man named Zhang Baosan in the town. A rogue. Acquainted with a clerk in the provincial office. Quite familiar with the government. Once there were two families, Hu and Fu, in the area. Arguing over a woman in a lawsuit. Hu's reason was wrong but he was rich. So he hired Zhang and bribed the officials with 20,000 taels of silver. The prison was released. Zhang divided the money and did some small good deeds in the countryside. The people in the town praised him. Later, someone repaired the Bodhi Temple. Obtained Mr. Zhenchuan's portrait from the forehead. Zhang then built three houses on the side. Supplying images in it. A place for scholars in the village to gather and write. And slightly give money to give awards. So the scholars in the town. Also praised it. One year. There was a drought in the county. But Minglun, the magistrate of Jiading, took a trip to the town to investigate the famine. Discussed relief with the gentry at the Literary Meeting place. Hearing about Zhang's character. Strange. Called to speak. Very happy. He entrusted the relief to him. So Zhang was able to be listed among the gentry. Later, Tao Wenyi Shu. Moved to Jiangsu. Met the emperor in Beijing. The emperor loved reading Mr. Zhenchuan's writings. Ordered Tao to visit him after taking office. After Tao took office. He only got Gui Tian in the butcher shop. Ordered to change his name. Pulled into the martial arts academy. Afterwards, I wanted to build a Mr. Zhenchuan Academy. Difficult to find the person. It happened that he was subordinate to the East and came to visit. Tao spoke about the reason. But he raised Zhang to reply. Tao called to speak. Also unhappy. He entrusted the matter of the academy to him. And ordered sixty-three states and counties. Split the cost of construction. By the time the academy was completed. All famous public officials. Poets and poets. Come from thousands of miles away. Xiao Guan ran through the clouds. Singing all night long. Was called a grand event for a while. And Zhang's name also became famous. Later, Zhang rebuilt the first house behind the hospital. Married into a famous family. Now a family. Later, Tao left office. Lin Wenzhong replaced him. Visited the Mr. Zhenchuan statue at the academy. Actually split the court with Zhang. The rest of the officers below are needless to say. In my opinion, Tao and Lin are both famous ministers. I heard that But is also a follower. Zhang was a rogue. He was able to win his favor. Name became famous. The family is rich. Is it not strange? Wang also said that Zhang didn't know how to read. Want to write a letter. Dictating to others to write it. All have their reasons. Traveling with dignitaries. Improvise in the flower-flying game. Ancient poems and idioms. Come out of the mouth. At the time of building the academy. Its picture also came out of Zhang's hands. Pavilions. Ponds and stones, flowers and trees. All have the right location. Then Zhang is also a strange person. It is appropriate that he was appreciated by the three men.</p>
<h3>Flowers on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line</h3>
<p>— Yan Yin</p>
<p>People always say that young women are a tool to comfort life. A gathering without beauties makes people unhappy, especially for travelers. In a lonely lamp and desolate house, one often feels a sense of desolate vastness. Brothels and entertainment venues arise to take advantage of this time, also to comfort the loneliness of travelers. On the arid roads of the Northwest, there are also so-called "highway prostitutes." Since the railway was built, this kind of livelihood has disappeared. Unexpectedly, even on the most prosperous Beijing-Shanghai train, there are those who ride the rails, rushing by, and engaging in the business of selling smiles. One morning, returning to Shanghai from the capital, I lingered on the platform, as the train had not yet left the depot. Suddenly, a charming woman appeared, about twenty-four or five years old, tall and graceful, wearing a light yellow long cheongsam, and sporting tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses. She was dressed in leather shoes and silk stockings, and carrying a handbag, resembling a female school teacher. She spoke with a Beijing accent. The ticket collectors and train attendants on the train all seemed to know her, nodding in greeting, and she responded with a smile. I felt that she was unlike ordinary female passengers catching the train, because her words and actions were frivolous and not dignified, easily discernible at a glance. I then asked a familiar train employee, "Who is she?" He smiled and said, "Don't you know? This is what they call a 'flower on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line.'" I heard that this woman claims to be the concubine of a certain warlord, traveling between Beijing and Zhenjiang several times a week, to attract lonely and sad travelers. With a few words and glances, she entices them, and they get off the train at Zhenjiang, using hotels as their platforms. Those coming from Zhenjiang use Xiaguan as their destination. If travelers recognize her, it's like driving a familiar car on a well-known road. However, this woman's footsteps are only found on the Nanjing-Zhenjiang section. It is said that there is another person operating from Changzhou to Wuxi and Suzhou. As for the Suzhou-Shanghai section, no one has yet taken over, because there are more beauties in this section, making it difficult to start. Alas, people's lives are declining, and it is difficult to make a living. The strong take risks, and the weak have no choice but to resort to this path. People speak of loving couples, but I compare myself to a lonely wild goose. How can one not feel even more emotional towards the "flowers on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line"?</p>
<h3>Travelogue of India (23)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>9th. I heard of someone familiar with the situation in Tibet and visited him. According to him, the current population of Tibet is about 3 million, divided into three sects: Black Sect, Red Sect, and Yellow Sect. All believe in Buddhism. The Black Sect is the original old school, with many Buddhist lay practitioners. The Red Sect was founded by Padmasambhava, who does not prohibit issues of men and women outside the monastery, but they are prohibited inside. Their lamas are called Gompas, and they hold a significant position in the belief of the general public. The Yellow Sect is a pure monastic sect, founded by Je Tsongkhapa. The current Dalai Lama is their Pope. There are three major monasteries in total. One is Zhebung, originally intended for 9,900 monks, but now has over 10,000. The second is Ganden, originally intended for 5,500 monks, but now has 6,000 to 7,000. The third is Sera, originally intended for 3,300 monks, but now has 4,000 to 5,000. All are growing daily. The influence of the Red Sect is mostly in the area of Yatung Pass on the border between Yunnan and Tibet. The Red Sect lamas also help the Yellow Sect because Tibetans believe in the law of the Chakravarti. Their lamas are like Popes. There is a strange thing, and it's hard to say if it's entirely superstition. After a lama dies, another lama is selected. They can predict in advance where they will be reincarnated and descend into the world. Then, they go to that place and bring back a three- or five-year-old child. They test him in public, taking the bowls and chopsticks used by the previous lama and mixing them among many other bowls and chopsticks, and having him choose. He can choose correctly without error. Then, after three times of using dough to divine, it is also permitted by the gods. He is then formally appointed as the next lama. The reasoning behind this is difficult to understand. Perhaps there is a secret technique involved, which is hard to say.</p>
<p>As for the Tibetan people's feelings towards China, they still cherish and remember it. The Dalai Lama also has not forgotten China, but is simply succumbing to pressure. Why? Today, England's management of Tibet has already reached a mature stage. On one hand, they control the southeast of Tibet from Burma and China through the Yunnan border, and on the other hand, they are building railways on three routes, all approaching Tibet. One railway from Buxa to Bhutan can be reached in just six days, reaching Lhasa, the capital city of Tibet where the Dalai Lama resides. Two routes to Lhasa take only seven days, and the third route from Kalimpong to Lhasa takes only sixteen or seventeen days. If anything happens, they can advance on four routes, taking a surrounding position with no escape. But if China sends troops to Tibet, it would still take two months to reach Tibet from Yunnan, and three months from Sichuan. The whip is beyond reach.</p>
<p>There are over 10,000 soldiers inside Tibet, with thousands of rifles. Some were left by China, some were sold by England, and some were sold by Russian merchants. There is also a factory that can manufacture them itself. There is a technician named Cai from Sichuan who studied in Japan and is now teaching Tibetans how to make cannons. Regarding the relationship between Tibet and China, after the Qianlong Emperor, the Manchu official Fu Kangan once led troops into Tibet to help Tibet defeat Nepal, because Nepal had started a war with Tibet. As a result, Nepal was defeated and paid tribute to China. Yue Zhongqi was a famous general who pacified Tibet. Recently, because of the demarcation of the Sichuan-Tibetan border, with the Kham region being assigned to Sichuan, the Tibetans were dissatisfied with Sichuan and sent troops into Tibet. The Tibetans attacked the Sichuan troops, and the Sichuan troops were defeated and retreated. Generally speaking, China mainly relies on the troops on the Sichuan border, making it not easy to pacify Tibet. Tibet has a standing army and can continue to mobilize tens of thousands of soldiers, it is said.</p>
<p>A certain country has long been plotting to take over Tibet, and now its power is already established. If China has any hope, it is only to connect with its people and reform its politics. Because today the Tibetan people's burdens are becoming heavier and heavier, with heavy taxes levied on cattle and horses. People harbor resentment. Temples are extremely rich, partly because people like to donate to temples after death, and partly because temples lend money. There is a lot of gold in Tibet, but the people don't know how to use it. Tibet produces little, only wool and musk. I see that their people are similar in race to Mongolians and Han Chinese, and not like Indians. Some Tibetans still keep queues.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Prices Tend Towards Peaks</h3>
<p>▲ Jumping High by Thirteen Taels</p>
<p>▲ Banks Absorb Cash: Yesterday, the 13th, the gold fixing suddenly reached a peak. The situation is complex, and the volatility is significant, with fluctuations of fifteen or sixteen taels in the front and back markets. Brokers have different requests for supply. However, market sentiment has turned from weak to strong, likely due to favorable foreign exchange trends. Quotations remain the same, but the overseas silver market was unmoved by the rise reported the day before yesterday (Sunday), which was only a slight increase. Gold prices opened high, but sellers were consistently numerous, immediately showing weakness and breaking through the 710 tael mark. Afterwards, major players such as Fuyu, Hengxing, Zhenchang, Xiangyuan, and Hengheng successively purchased, and with favorable exchange rates, the price surged, gradually rising by ten taels. At noon, sellers were reluctant, and the price retreated again. The after-market was generally sharp, and buying interest remained strong, likely due to tighter exchange rates, soaring high and exceeding the 720 tael mark. There is a possibility of a fall in large bars this morning.</p>
<p>▲ Slight Fluctuations in the Morning: Since the opening of the May market this morning, the price has risen by four taels and five qian, to 710 taels. Although large silver bars increased by one-sixteenth, and the silver price increased by one-quarter, private telegrams only increased by five-sixteenths, so market sentiment remained stable. Also, because Cuichang, Yongyu, and others were purchasing, shortly after, Chenfeng, Yongyi, Yuxinheng, and the Dalian gang sold off, and the price gradually fell by five or six taels, to only 0.06 taels and five qian. And British gold was traded by Mitsui and Holland at 13.5 for this month, and Mackrow and Datong traded American gold at 31.5 yuan for June. Then they traded at the same price for this month. Moments later, it went upwards, because Yuanmao, Yongzhen, Changxiang, Fuyu, and others came to buy, and in just a quarter of an hour, it was pushed up by more than eight taels. When the exchange rate was announced, it was 14.5 taels, and the quotation remained unchanged, and it was increased by five qian. Shortly after, Hengxingyuan and others sold, and Huabi sold June British gold at 134.4375. Nearing 10 o'clock, it was 11.5 taels. Afterwards, Mitsui, Makari, and others all bought in at 4.375, and Fuchang, Yuanheng, and others for hedging, and Qianchangxiang, Zhenchangxiang, and others followed suit. And the rumor that a certain bank was absorbing cash, market sentiment improved immediately, and the price rose sharply, so it was raised to above 15 taels, with fluctuations of one or two taels. After 10:45, another three taels were added, until 11:00, reaching 18 taels. Then, Yongheng, Yuancheng, Hengxing, and the Dalian gang took the opportunity to sell, and in just 20 minutes, it plunged by six taels. At 11:25, it was 11.5 taels. Wu Pin and Tongtaichang bought in, and banks such as China, England, and Japan absorbed June British gold at 4.375. The American Bank Company bought Citibank at 31.125 yuan, and the price rose again. At 11:30, it was 15.78 qian. Suddenly, Yongheng and Hengxing sold again, so the price fell again. At noon, it was 0.09 taels. Hedging came in, and at the close of the market, it was 12.5 taels. The announced price was still 777 taels, with a premium of a little over 64.5 taels to 60 taels. At noon, the premium was still 64.5 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Smooth Sailing in the Afternoon Market: The afternoon market opened at 12.5 taels, then at 14 taels. The Indian exchange rate cable came and increased by two annas, so it retreated to 12.5 taels. Afterwards, Yuanheng and others bought in, and because British gold seemed weak, Shanghai bought 4.375 for July, and Taiwan issued Japanese gold for this month at 1 tael and 5 qian and 8 fen and 5 li. Makrow sold British gold to Mitsui at 375, so after 2:30, it rose to 17 taels and 12 qian. Then it was slightly less by 2.5 taels. After 3 o'clock, forward British gold was traded between banks at 375, and also at 31.125 yuan for Citibank. There was a great demand at the counter. Shunli, Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Yuda, and Wu Pin were enthusiastically buying, and the market situation was almost soaring. It had already exceeded the 20 tael mark, and at nearly 4 o'clock, it even reached 22 taels. British gold could be sold at 375. Soon, retail investors sold, and the price dropped by over 3 taels, to 18 taels and 56 qian. Afterwards, buyers were endless, and at the close of the market at 4:30, it was 21.5 taels, an increase of 13 taels compared to last Saturday. The highest price of the day was 22 taels, and the lowest price was 0.06 taels, a difference of 15.5 qian. Wu Pin's morning market was 12.5 taels, the noon close was 12.5 taels, the afternoon was 13.5 taels, and the closing price was 21 taels. The quoted premium was 64.5 taels to 55 or 56 taels. The settling price was 13 taels in the morning and 22 taels in the afternoon. The water supplement was 0.09 taels in the morning and 18 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>▲ Exceptional Agility in Transactions: In the transactions of various firms, Chenfengshui, Xinyuheng, Yiyu, Yuancheng, Hengxing, Yuanmao, Yongheng, Hengxingyuan, Shunli, and others were selling. Cuichangyong, Fuyu, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Jiachangxiang, and Wu Pin were all buying. Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Yuantai, Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, and Futaiheng had quite a few ins and outs, in considerable numbers. Yuda bought early and sold late. In the afternoon, Yuanheng, Cuichangyong, Yuda, Zhifengyong, Lichang, Shunli, and Wu Pin were all buying. Wanxing, Yuanmao, Futaiheng, Zhenchangxiang, and Taichangyong were sometimes selling and sometimes buying. Hengxing sold slightly, Qianchangxiang sold a lot. The Guang Gang collectively sold 500 bars, and the Dalian Gang collectively sold 1,600 or 1,700 bars, buying in over 1,500 bars, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Seems to Be Turning Better</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC listed foreign exchange with only the Indian exchange rate up by 0.25, totaling 84 rupees and 75, Hong Kong was up by 0.25, totaling 79 taels, and the rest were unchanged. As for the British and American silver markets, there was a slight increase in telegrams the day before yesterday. However, the Shanghai market was unmoved, likely because the interbank exchange rates were initially loose and then tightened, and became stronger in the afternoon, because the gold market had escaped the 720 tael mark trend. As a result, compared to last Saturday, British gold shrank by 0.125, American gold shrank by 0.25, and the Japanese exchange rate increased by 0.0125. Market sentiment was trending high. Chinese merchants like Fuchang and others were still selling. British gold transactions totaled over 200,000 pounds. Banks such as Mitsui, Makrow, Masajin, and Shanghai Sumitomo were all taking in, while Huabi and Sumitomo sold slightly. There were also slight sales in telegrams from Bombay. Various banks were trading with each other, but not frequently. American gold was also traded for over 200,000. Silver companies were slightly absorbing, and only a small number of transactions occurred in the gold industry. It seemed that only a few hundred thousand yuan of Japanese gold was traded. However, the exchange market seemed to be improving.</p>
<p>▲ British Exchange Rates: The interbank market had fluctuations of 0.1875. The asking price in the morning was 1 shilling and 3 pence and 7375, and the buying price was 4375. The noon close was an asking price of 4375 and a buying price of 13.5. The closing price in the afternoon was an asking price of 3125 and a buying price of 375.</p>
<p>▲ American Exchange Rates: The interbank market had fluctuations of 0.375. The asking price in the morning was 31.125 yuan, and the buying price was 31.25 yuan. The noon close was an asking price of 31.25 yuan, and the buying price was 375. The closing price was an asking price of 31 yuan, and a buying price of 31.125 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ East Asian Exchange Rates: The interbank market had a difference of one cent. The asking price in the early market was 1 tael and 5 qian and 8 fen and 5 li, and the buying price was 1 tael and 5 qian and 7 fen and 5 li. Taiwan bought a current term of Dalian for 1 tael and 5 qian and 7 fen. The noon close had an asking price of 1 tael and 5 qian and 8 fen, and a buying price of 5 qian and 7 fen. In the afternoon, Taiwan bought April for 1 tael and 5 qian and 8 fen and 5 li. The closing price had an asking price of 1 tael and 5 qian and 25, and a buying price of 1 tael and 5 qian and 8 fen and 25 li, it is said.</p>
<h3>Clear Interest Rate Market, Loose Monetary Conditions Remain</h3>
<p>Looking at the market atmosphere from all sides yesterday, there was generally no good news. However, foreign goods and customer sales were not weak. Although not eagerly sought after, they were still barely satisfactory. And the long-sluggish monetary conditions, even if there is demand, are reluctant to act rashly. The supply side's lining has accumulated day by day, with no way to arrange it. The white borrowing of interbank interest rates in recent days is likely due to this.</p>
<p>▲ Interest Rate Prices: The "foreign interest" rate was slightly better in the early market, so it was 0.25 higher, at 7 qian and 2 fen and 6 li and 3 hao and 7 hu and half. The situation in the afternoon market was even better, and the result was another 0.5 li higher, at 7 qian and 2 fen and 6 li and 8 hao and 7 hu and half. The "silver interest rate" was 0.2 fen in the early market and a white loan in the afternoon market, making the situation feel looser than the previous day. The dividing line has never been watered down.</p>
<p>▲ Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: Jiangnan small foreign coins rose immediately in the early market, to 6 qian and 4 fen and 6 li and half. The afternoon market was another 2.5 li higher, at 6 qian and 4 fen and 9 li. As a result, it rose by a total of 5 li compared to the early market the previous day. Transactions totaled 2,000 jiao in the early market and 5,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins also increased by over 2 li, with the early market at 6 qian and 4 fen and 2 li and 7 hao and half, and the afternoon market at 6 qian and 4 fen and 4 li, a total increase of 2.5 li compared to the early market the previous day. Transactions totaled 120,000 jiao in the early market and 145,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins also shrank by 500 wen, to 370,000 qian wen with no odd change.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds" yesterday, banks received and released a slightly better amount because it was the opening of the market on Monday. Chinese merchants received over 2.9 million in released notes, released over 2.2 million, various goods and taxes totaled over 11 million, pledge transactions and redemptions were 500,000 to 600,000, special funds were over 1 million, and the outflow from warehouses was 1.6 million. Japanese merchant banks received over 5.3 million in various funds and had 400,000 go into warehouses. Private banks and public silver offices received over 44.4 million, funds from divisions totaled over 5.1 million, funds from various routes totaled over 1.4 million, and cash received was over 1 million. "Foreign Funds" early market transactions totaled 1,615,000, and afternoon transactions totaled 980,000. Banknotes totaled 55,000 in the early market and 20,000 in the afternoon market. Outside banknotes totaled 165,000 in the early market and 120,000 in the afternoon market. Spot foreign coins totaled 125,000 in the early market and 150,000 in the afternoon market. Interbank morning market interbank trades totaled 750,000, and afternoon interbank trades totaled 550,000. Various banks received and released over 1.7 million from foreign accounts, banknote inflows and outflows totaled 1.7 or 1.8 million, customer sales totaled over 1.2 million, private banks received and released over 8.5 million, foreign fund divisions totaled over 2.3 million, interbank foreign loans totaled over 1.4 million, and small banks exchanged banknotes and sold foreign exchange and spot foreign coins totaling 600,000 to 700,000.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Prices Rise Around Six or Seven Jiao</h3>
<p>▲ Market Conditions Slightly Active, Transactions Totaling Over 9.4 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, although spot government bonds still only had sporadic transactions, the futures market was more active than at the end of last week, and the trend continued to be quite peaceful. As a result, compared to the end of last week, the 96 demobilization, 19 customs, 19 customs, and 20 cigarette bonds rose by around seven or eight jiao, while others also rose by two or three jiao. Total spot transactions for the day were 11,400 yuan, and total futures transactions reached over 9.4 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Listless and Unremarkable</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat and weak, and the trend is extremely slack. There are very few yarn futures transactions, with blank bids dominating auctions. This situation is because both the long and short sides are holding a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for opportunities to move. However, spot yarn sales in the market are still considered developed. Purchasing in the North China area is relatively active, and the Sichuan gang also has smooth digestion. However, market sentiment is still difficult to lift. Most sellers' psychology is that the future will gradually enter a period of indifference. And the bottom stock of coarse yarn is relatively thick, but certain large merchants and major players are still keeping it tight. The strike of customs brokers has been resolved, and shipments can proceed, so the yarn market may rise a little.</p>
<p>▲ Human Standard Slightly Stronger: The opening of the human standard pre-market was slightly stronger due to the rise in external cotton, and market sentiment was tense. Each month rose by 3, 5, and 6 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual demand was good, and the opening market atmosphere was firm, and each month rose by 2 or 3 qian. However, the market lacked business and market conditions were slack, with very few transactions. As a result, the middle month fell by 1 qian, with transactions totaling 5,200 yuan. It was found that Tongyu bought 550 bales and Gengfeng bought 500 bales. Heshen bought 450 bales, Yongfeng bought 400 bales, and Shenji bought 750 bales. The human standard auction closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Human Standard Closing Price Increase/Decrease Stock Balance</p>
<p>April 1662 Up 6 30,000 July 1676 Up 4 59,800</p>
<p>May 1672 Up 5 53,650 August 1677 Up 6 56,100</p>
<p>June 1675 Up 5 74,100 September 1643 Up 2 13,850</p>
<p>▲ Yarn Sales Slightly Active: Spot yarn sales are relatively active, and it was found that various gangs bought a total of 2,200 bales throughout the day. Transactions among peers amounted to 250 bales. Market conditions are firm. Among the customer gangs, Sichuan bought 640 bales, Tianjin bought 390 bales, Guangdong bought 100 bales, the interior bought 460 bales, Shantou bought 200 bales, Hankou bought 120 bales, Qinhuangdao bought 160 bales, Changsha bought 75 bales, Jiangxi bought 100 bales, Chenghai Street bought 80 bales, and a certain gang bought 100 bales, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Stable and Trending Positive</h3>
<p>The cotton market is relatively quiet, likely because American cotton has rebounded and the gold market is slightly stronger, leading to slightly firmer market sentiment. Nissho Iwai Corporation is buying in May futures and releasing distant months. Spot cotton transactions are quiet in various factories, but the market trend is still strong, because the existing stock is thin and the sources from various routes are not smooth. New sellers do not dare to act rashly. The future depends on the fluctuations of the external cotton market.</p>
<p>▲ Han Standard Trending Upward: The opening of the Han standard pre-market was slightly firmer due to the rise in American cotton, with each month rising by 2 or 3 qian. The market atmosphere was still good at the opening in the afternoon, and the closing price was slightly softer, rising from 0.05 to 0.1 qian. Transactions totaled 19,400 dan. Gengfeng bought 2,200 dan, Yongfeng bought 1,200 dan, Tianlong sold 800 dan, Yilong sold 800 dan, and Shenda sold 1,700 dan. The Han standard closing prices are listed on the left.

<p>▲ Cotton Demand Mediocre: Spot cotton transactions are average, and the source is 150 bales of Yaohua and 200 bales of Tonghua, it is said.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 43.00 Tongxing Factory bought 100 pieces and sent them to the factory.</p>
<h3>Prices of Three Goods, Yarn, and Cotton Continue to Rise</h3>

<h3>British and Indian Cotton Industry Weekly News</h3>
<p>▲ Bombay: In the previous week, futures fell with American cotton, and factory demand and exports were also poor. Due to speculative sales at the end of last month, the market trend was the weakest. However, the continued decline immediately stopped, and delivery for the April-May period reached 13,300 bales, all absorbed by a certain well-known cotton merchant. Due to the holidays in early April, business was scarce. Recently, there has been slight demand for Omra and Pingor. Bai Luoxi's transportation is poor. Local factories are buying East African cotton. European demand is flat. Japanese textile manufacturers are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The attached statistics for the previous week are as follows (unit: thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1930 1931</p>
<p>Cumulative receipt count from September 1st 2,706 2,513</p>
<p>Weekend inventory 1,256 963</p>
<p>Cumulative exports from September 1st 1,679 1,709</p>
<p>Shipped to Europe 573 435</p>
<p>Shipped to China 260 235</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan 804 1,024</p>
<p>Other places 42 15</p>
<p>▲ Liverpool: Spot inquiries continue to be good. In terms of futures, the decline was very sharp due to the liquidation of long positions. At the weekend, there were slight sporadic purchases because Egyptian cotton was better. However, the global textile industry is not good, so market sentiment is still bearish. Egyptian cotton market prices were weak first and then rebounded.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices: High-Quality White Rice Still Seeing Declines</h3>
<p>▲ Zhongguan Rice Gradually Becoming More Active</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday, about thirty to forty inland sources arrived at Zhabei. Sales of high-quality white rice remained sluggish, with prices down about half a "chi" (unit of length). However, the lower grades of Zhongguan rice saw increased activity due to consecutive days of price drops, attracting some merchant interest. Nonetheless, the market continued to decline, with slight decreases for "Bo Dao" (thin rice) and slight price decreases for "Jiao" (another unit of money). Although the supply of "Yang Du Xian" (a type of rice) and local "Bu Xian" (another type of rice) was not abundant, sluggish sales led to slight decreases. Top-quality "Yang Xian" was only around 11.5 yuan. Ordinary "Bai Yuan" rice, except for special grades, also decreased by about one "chi".</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai South: Yesterday's sales on this street were poor. Top-quality high-grade white rice was extremely scarce, while various grades of rice below the top level saw few inquiries. Prices dropped by one or two "jiao" (currency unit) from morning to noon. By the closing bell, news from the North indicated weakness, leading to a stabilized downward trend. Sales of "Nan Bang Bo Zao Dao" (South Bank thin early rice) were extremely sluggish, dropping slightly. The supply of "Yang Du Jian" rice here was insufficient and did not change much. Demand for "Bian Yuan Yin Hua Dao Tou" (a type of processed rice) was slightly better, while sales of "Diao Fan Liang" (hanging rice) were mediocre. The market hovered around a "xiu jiao" (currency unit) left.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Reverts to Positive Momentum</h3>
<p>After the morning and afternoon trading sessions yesterday, the flour market showed a favorable trend across all months. Foreign quotations generally rebounded by two, three, or four "jiao". Tianjin's daily sales of current-month flour were brisk, reaching approximately 50,000 bags per day, with prices increasing by two "fen" to 3.12 yuan. As a result, most people felt more confident, especially regarding buying interest in the current month. Because troop ships can now be loaded, with standards only adding 7.5 "fen", the appetite for actual sales became more lively. Distant months saw smaller gains because small factories were still unloading positions. The current month may improve by another one or two "fen" due to spot sales. Ultimately, the current month was up by two "fen", May by one "fen", June and July by 7.5 "li", August by one "fen", and September by one and a half "fen".</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Market Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the morning and afternoon opening bells, the futures wheat market saw stability across all months. Foreign quotations also rebounded. Although gold prices showed some consolidation, they remained above 700 taels. Considering the environment, the market seemed more stable than the previous month. However, because of unfavorable weather, inland merchants were less enthusiastic about buying than before. Therefore, while the situation was positive, gains were limited. Ultimately, the current month was up by three "fen" from the previous week, May and June by three "fen", July by one "fen", August unchanged, and September by two "fen".</p>
<h3>Futures Soybean Cake Firming Up</h3>
<p>▲ Futures Soybeans: Yesterday, standard Dalian soybeans opened with a surge, reflecting the activity in the Dalian market. There was decent buying interest in purple soybeans and cut soybeans. However, some profit-taking long positions and local brokers continued to sell and hedge, so while the situation was firm, prices could not rise too high. The overall trend for all contract months was good during the morning and afternoon sessions, with high trading volumes on the exchange. Therefore, the future of the soybean market depends on the Dalian market and soybean cake sales. The closing result was 4.465 taels for both the April and June contracts, up by one "fen", and 4.466 taels for May, up by three "fen".</p>
<p>▲ Futures Cake: Inland merchants have already purchased a significant amount. Merchants from Wenzhou, Fujian, and other regions have considerable holdings, so the underlying market is quite strong. However, foreign markets are stagnant, while Dalian's electronic market showed slight improvement. Local brokers still have a strong desire to sell, as the Dalian and Shanghai markets are still profitable. Therefore, trading volume at the close was thin. Ultimately, the April contract was up by one "fen", May and June contracts by 2.5 "li", the first half of July by half a "fen", and the second half of July by 7.5 "li".</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated White Sugar Trending Upward</h3>
<p>▲ Daily Sugar Trading Still Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, no market reports arrived from the sugar-producing regions. In the public market, buying interest in Dutch sugar #22 coarse granulated white was active, with transactions at 10.0375 to 10.04 taels. Some Hong Kong goods traded at 10.03 taels. The total volume was about 1,000 bags, and the market was quite stable. #20 medium granulated white sugar saw quieter trading at 9.875 taels. The daily sugar market also saw slight increases, with active trading. N-mark at 10.03 taels, TM-mark at 9.925 taels, YT-mark at 10.175 to 10.2 taels, YP-mark at 10.06 taels, YRO-mark at 9.75 taels, and J-mark at 10.0725 taels. Daily prices rose by 2.5 to 5 "fen", but withdrawals were limited, and the market was quite favorable.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Longkou Vermicelli New Goods to Appear Soon</h3>
<p>▲ Aged Vermicelli Stock Low, Rebounding</p>
<p>Previously, sales of Longkou vermicelli were sluggish, and new goods were being produced at the source. Therefore, Shanghai prices repeatedly declined, with the lowest price reaching 19.5 taels, down by two taels from before. According to reports from Longkou, the new vermicelli will cost approximately 26.7 taels per package and cannot be cheaper. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai after ten days, with a cost of 20.5 taels in Shanghai. Current inventory here is low, and there has been recent activity in Fuzhou and Xiamen. Therefore, selling pressure has rebounded. Yesterday, the market price was 19.8 taels, and the market situation was stable.</p>
<p>]P&gt;Silk and Tea: Foreign Silk Market Increasingly Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign silk market continued to be weak due to rising exchange rates and declining silk prices in Europe and America. Chinese raw silk from local tenant farmers was difficult to sell, and the market was quiet. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson imported only fifteen bales of Shanghai white filature, and Gobeille imported twenty-two bales of yellow-white woven silk. Prices were both flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Needle and Eyebrow Green Tea Sales Active to England</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jardine Matheson of the English Company showed slightly more interest in needle and eyebrow green tea from both the "Lu Zhuang" (roadside) and "Tu Zhuang" (local) markets. Total transactions were over 370 boxes, with selling prices similar to before. Jardine Matheson and China Tea Company also showed interest in Zhen Mei green tea from Wuyuan's Gao Zhuang (High Village). However, due to prolonged sluggishness in the market, large orders dropped by three to four taels again. English and French merchants are negotiating for Zhen Mei from Tunxi and Shexian, but no deals have been reached.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: All Goods Show Improvement</h3>
<p>▲ Local Cotton Market: Recently, the market has shown a strong upward trend. Although customs clearance has not yet started, the overseas yarn market has seen continuous gains, attracting numerous foreign customers. Therefore, morale is high. Yesterday, all prices rose. Fine cloth rose by about five "fen", fine twill by one "qian", and coarse cloth saw even larger gains. There may be a shortage of Hubei goods later, as prices there are higher than in Shanghai, making shipping to Shanghai uneconomical. Since Sanxin stopped weaving, local production has significantly decreased, leading to supply shortages. Yesterday, Flying Bear and One Buffalo, both 13-pound brands, were clearing customs at 6.1 taels. Coarse twill is also trending firmer, but foreign sales are quieter. Among all goods, fine cloth is the most active, and June's production has already been sold out.</p>
<p>▲ Eastern and Western Piece Goods: Yesterday, market conditions improved due to rising gold prices, and morale strengthened. In addition, customs clearance for fancy goods is said to start today, so merchants have raised prices across the board. Eastern goods, such as straight tribute wool, Mogan Mountain hunting geese, were all at 3.65 "qian". Straight tribute satin continued to rise by five "li", with First Merit at 3.5 "qian", Four Scholars at 3.4 "qian", and Three Friends at 3.3 "qian". Fine Drill could not rise due to the abundance of goods from brokers, except for Treasure Ball at 3.8 "qian". Blue striped serge gradually increased. Yesterday, Zijin Mountain Hanshan Temple were both at 2.35 "qian", and Four Scholars at 2.3 "qian". White crepe has stabilized due to weather conditions. Yuan Yang cloth is being purchased by inland merchants, with "Dian Qiu Xiang" at 10.07 taels and "Yi Pin" at 10.05 taels. Western goods, such as Yuan Western satin, are in short supply, and white striped linen is gradually seeing movement with stable prices.</p>
<h3>Sales of Blue Woolen Cloth Plunge</h3>
<p>Sales of woolen cloth have been good recently, with many merchants placing orders with foreign companies. However, sales of blue woolen cloth serge, which has been popular in recent years, have plunged. This is because its popularity has lasted for four years, and demand from domestic customers has suddenly decreased. People seem to favor the new and dislike the old. Currently, only blue flash Walter cloth and blue thin elephant skin raincoat cloth are still selling. Other blue fabrics, such as tweed, serge, Walter cloth, and flannel, are unlikely to see any activity.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: White Tung Oil Spring Sales About to Start</h3>
<p>Tung oil is normally a hot seller in the spring, but due to last year's sluggish business, sales have also decreased. White tung oil is mainly for export. Since the price of gold has risen, European and American foreign companies find it difficult to make a profit, and few are buying, which has dampened the market. A month ago, supply from Hankou was relatively strong, and the market was sluggish. Foreign companies dropped prices to 18.4 taels, but later rebounded to 20.067 taels as foreign companies slightly increased purchases. Now that inland sales are about to start, the local market is also gradually becoming more active. However, sources have long been ignoring Hankou tung oil, relying only on Hangzhou tung oil. Merchants have purchased two to three thousand loads from Hangzhou at a price of 31 yuan per load delivered to Shanghai, which is more economical than Hankou. It is said that Hangzhou merchants also have limited inventory. Oil presses in Jinhua, Lanxi, Fenshui, Tonglu, Yanzhou, and Quzhou sell immediately after pressing and do not accumulate inventory. Therefore, with high handling costs, the market will rise.</p>
<h3>Metals: New Lead Wire Price Drops by 2.5 Qian</h3>
<p>▲ Blue Lead Fixed Price Remarkably Soft</p>
<p>▲ New Lead Wire: The market for #16 to #25 has recently seen a surge in Eastern imports and a lack of sales, so standard prices have fallen by 2.5 "qian". #16 to #20 is selling for 13.5 taels, and #21 to #25 is selling for 19.5 taels. Yesterday's orders were mostly for small quantities. There were no large transactions. Overseas prices have reportedly plummeted by more than one pound, so local prices are unlikely to rebound.</p>
<p>▲ Blue Lead: Recently, overseas fixed prices have been remarkably soft, leading to a decrease in local prices. Foreign lead is estimated at 15.75 taels, and domestic lead at 15.4 taels, down by three to four "qian" from last week. It is said that general merchants are pessimistic due to the weakness in overseas markets, leading to a decline in local prices.</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>The Yunnan Problem</h3>
<p>— Tang Bin</p>
<p>Compiled by Hua Qiyun, published by Datong Bookstore</p>
<p>The fact that our countrymen are now gradually paying attention to the importance of border defense is a good sign for the revitalization of our nation. The Japanese attempts to control Manchuria and Mongolia, and the British eyeing of Tibet, are all worthy of our study. We must never allow our entire territory to be devoured by other countries. Even when a new issue arises in Manchuria and Mongolia, the Japanese are eager to be the first to notice. They will write about it extensively in their newspapers, giving it double the promotion, causing the people of the entire country to take special notice, stimulating their interest in research, and acting as a backing for the government's ambitions to seize Manchuria and Mongolia. At the same time, the government also sends specialists to Manchuria and Mongolia to investigate industries and survey resources every year, no less than several dozens to hundreds of people. As for collections of works on Manchuria and Mongolia, there are so many in Japan that they could fill a cow cart and make it sweat. From this, it can be seen how much attention they pay to our country's borders, and at the same time, it can be known the importance of the position it occupies. In our country, it is only now that some people are paying attention to this border issue, and collections of works on Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet are gradually appearing in bookstores. This, of course, is worth describing, so that our complete territory does not fall piecemeal into the hands of other countries, and so that our nation gradually becomes rich and strong. This is what the compatriots across the country hope for. Of course, the importance of the Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet issues is great, but the Yunnan issue cannot be ignored. Although it is the second-largest province in terms of area among the Eighteen Provinces, its situation and other important aspects are unmatched by any other province. Some people think that Yunnan is a remote border area and has nothing to do with the overall situation, but they do not know that Yunnan is located upstream of the other provinces and has the form of overturning the world. This can indeed be proven by geography and history.</p>
<p>Entering Sichuan from Yunnan means taking control of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Passing through Guizhou to Huangping Yuanjiang to reach Hunan means being able to influence the north. Heading east to Guangxi, following the West River downwards, also means being able to take control of the Pearl River Basin. Liu Weitan said, "China is like a melon, and Yunnan is its stem. If the stem is rotten, the whole melon is rotten." This statement has full meaning, and it can also be proven by historical records. In the preface to the book, the author states, "In the Shu Han Dynasty, when Zhuge Wuhou led his troops on a northern expedition, he first conquered the southern barbarians to eliminate future troubles. In the middle of the Tang Dynasty, Yunnan was conquered by Nanzhao, and China suffered great turmoil. In the Song Dynasty, in order to avoid the mistakes of the Tang Dynasty, they first conquered Dali, and the Southern Song Dynasty was annexed. Recently, during the National Protection War in the fourth year of the Republic of China, Cai E was also able to rebuild the republic by relying on a corner of Yunnan. All of these are real historical examples and cannot be compared with empty echoes." These are indeed accurate words. The author then states, "Although the importance of Yunnan's situation depends entirely on Burma and Vietnam for protection, since Burma was lost to Britain and Vietnam was annexed by France, Yunnan has felt that its defenses have been completely removed and is surrounded by powerful neighbors. The border between Yunnan and Vietnam is mostly large mountains and rivers, which can still keep people out, but the interlocking border between Yunnan and Burma has no support. Fortunately, there is still the natural barrier of the Savage Mountain, which can separate China and foreign countries and serve as a natural Great Wall. However, even this place, the British are unwilling to let go and want to include it in their territory. The British invasion of Pianma in the late Qing Dynasty and the recent invasion of Jiangxinpo are both obvious examples of British aggression against the Savage Mountain. If the Savage Mountain is occupied by the British, not only will Yunnan be in danger, but the neighboring provinces of Sichuan and Tibet will also suffer. At this critical moment, if we do not widely publicize it, we will only repeat the mistakes of losing Vietnam and Burma in the past." These are golden words that deserve the attention of our countrymen. Objectively examining Yunnan from the perspective of historical and geographical evidence, there is indeed a need to pay attention to it at present. It is imperative that we recommend this book, "The Yunnan Problem," compiled by Hua Jun, to the reader.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts, the first part discussing British and French imperialism and Yunnan, with three chapters: 1. The Origins of British and French Covetousness of Yunnan, (A) Yunnan's Position in China, (B) The Motives of British and French Encroachment on Yunnan; 2. The Sino-British Yunnan-Burma Problem, (A) British Exploration in Yunnan, (B) The Loss of Burma, (C) The Yunnan-Burma Treaty, (D) The Yunnan-Burma Supplementary Treaty; 3. The Sino-French Yunnan-Vietnam Problem, (A) The Loss of Annam, (B) Regulations on Trade along the Vietnamese Border, (C) Commercial Treaties, (D) Border Treaties, (E) Supplementary Commercial Treaties, (F) Supplementary Border Treaties, (G) The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Problem, (H) The Sino-French Convention. The second part discusses the Southwest Border Issue and Yunnan, with three chapters: 1. A General Overview of the Yunnan-Burma-Northwest Border Affairs, 2. The Pianma Problem, 3. The Jiangxinpo Problem. All of these are important in discussing the Yunnan problem. The author provides a concise description based on historical facts, which should also be understood by our general public.</p>
<p>Yunnan's position in China is undoubtedly very important. Although its area is the second largest among the Eighteen Provinces, its population is the second smallest among the Eighteen Provinces. Regarding this, the author has a detailed table in the book, comparing them one by one, so that we can understand that Yunnan is indeed a province with a vast land and a sparse population in China. This phenomenon is not due to Yunnan's poor land and poor people, but because it is located in a remote border area, and there are few immigrants. However, its products are rich in resources and surpass the other provinces, with copper and tin being the most important. The so-called natives have benefited greatly from this. Yunnan has both a vast land and abundant resources. However, on the one hand, it has a vast land and abundant resources, while on the other hand, it has a sparse population. In the situation of "vast land and abundant resources, but a sparse population," it is easy to be coveted by ambitious foreigners. There are already many examples of this on our borders, such as Japan's coveting of Southern Mongolia and Eastern Mongolia, and Russia's taking advantage of the situation in Northern Manchuria and Outer Mongolia. Therefore, the rise of Yunnan and the British and French covetousness of Yunnan are of course inevitable.</p>
<p>The attitude of British imperialists towards China has been clearly stated, and their covetousness of Yunnan, together with France, is not accidental. In the early years of the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, French merchants such as Ause and De Zhangbi secretly traveled to Yunnan along the rivers, exploring the terrain of the mountains and rivers and the rich mineral resources. Later, the French Du Pei entered Yunnan from Vietnam to investigate the situation and trade in copper and tin. The great geologist Le Gle led his students to visit here and wrote a book on the mineral resources of Yunnan. Later, he entered Yunnan from Vietnam via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and used this to also encroach on Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, which shows the danger of their intentions. The French coveted Yunnan for its benefits, and we have already known their unpredictable nature. However, the deep foresight of the British is more than that of the French. The author states in the book that the motive of the British covetousness of Yunnan can be summarized in one sentence: "Monopolizing the commerce of the Yangtze River." The various unequal treaties signed by the British and French with China and with Vietnam and Burma for use in Yunnan and Vietnam are also listed in detail to make it clear to the reader at a glance. This is truly a great work that deserves praise.</p>
<p>Therefore, the author's upper part is mainly a general description, summarizing the history of British and French imperialist aggression against Yunnan, and the various unequal treaties related to Yunnan signed with China, with concise explanations. The unique feature of this part is this, which deserves our attention.</p>
<p>Yunnan Province used to have Burma protecting it to the west and Vietnam protecting it to the south. Originally, it was a land of natural barriers. Since Burma was lost to Britain and Vietnam was annexed by France, the so-called defenses were completely removed, and it was surrounded by powerful neighbors, and border issues arose from this. In view of this, the author specifically and concisely describes the border affairs of Yunnan, Burma, and the northwest, and in the lower part, the author's description is mainly based on analysis and research. All Qing Dynasty's border disputes with Burma and issues related to the southwest border, such as the Pianma problem and the Jiangxinpo problem, are dissected in detail, which is not easily seen in other books, and its value can be known.</p>
<p>At the beginning of our country's construction, all our compatriots hope to pay attention to border issues. This is indeed a critical juncture for the enrichment and strength of our nation, but there are few specialized books that describe this issue from the correct standpoint on the market. This book is one of a series of border issues. The author's previous two books, "The Manchuria-Mongolia Problem" and "The Tibet Problem," are both important works. This newly published book, "The Yunnan Problem," can be used as a reference for our research. In the future, if the situation on the border can arouse the attention of the general public and thorough investigation, then we must praise the author of this book.</p>

<h3>Random Notes from a Trip North</h3>
<p>— Anping</p>
<p>8. Twelve Hours of Predestined Connection</p>
<p>Having written to this point, I cannot help but turn back and write about a very interesting incident I experienced in the train car.</p>
<p>The train seemed quite empty that day, and no other passenger ever entered my car. On the morning of the fourth, after the train had passed Xuzhou, I woke up and, in my hazy state, it seemed as if there was someone else in my No. 1 compartment. I opened my eyes slightly and saw a young woman standing at the foot of my bed, amusing a child with laughter. They were looking at the fields flying past the window, with their backs to me. I really felt a bit awkward at that moment. You might not believe me if I told you, but I am quite shy in many ways, like a virgin boy. I was afraid she would see me, so I quickly closed my eyes, kept still, and pretended to be still asleep. But my mind was racing with thoughts. I wondered how I could get up gracefully, maintain a Gentleman's demeanor, and not reveal any awkwardness. Think about it, how could an inexperienced young man bring himself to get dressed in front of a strange woman?</p>
<p>Thank goodness, she soon took the child and went to the corridor. I felt like a weight had been lifted off my chest and my heart stopped pounding. I gently closed the sliding door and then slowly got dressed.</p>
<p>The porter came to bring me washing water. After that, I went to the dining car for a light snack.</p>
<p>In the dining car, I had finished eating, and because it was comfortable sitting on the leather stools and looking at the scenery, and the dining car wasn't very busy at that time anyway, I sat there for a long time. But sooner or later I had to return to my compartment. Thinking that I had been sitting in the dining car for too long, which didn't seem right, I had to bite the bullet and walk back.</p>
<p>When I walked into my No. 1 compartment, she looked as if she was sitting on the bunk, bored. I, with the most appropriate posture and expression, smiled and nodded at her. She returned the greeting.</p>
<p>I said, "Going where?"</p>
<p>"Jinan."</p>
<p>"Got on at Xuzhou?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>At that moment, the child, who was kneeling on the bunk with his face pressed against the glass looking at the scenery, turned around and looked at me strangely. I smiled at him with the air of an adult. But, it would be more accurate to say that I smiled at the woman rather than at the child.</p>
<p>The woman spoke with a good Beijing accent, and seemed to be from a very respectable family. Although she was full of the kind of heroism that is unique to Northern women, that heroism also contained some of the charm of Southern beauties. She spoke politely, intelligently, and in a straightforward and direct manner, which is something that Northern women have that Southern women lack – a different kind of style. She was the first person to approach me, and she was also the first to give me a very beautiful impression.</p>
<p>That time, we talked a lot. Although we were excited, we couldn't help but think that it was just like two ships, occasionally brushing shoulders in the sea of people. On the same road, we would be separated in the blink of an eye, each going our own way, so there was no need to be so unrestrained. But, when the mood comes, there's nothing you can do. The woman was also very good at talking, as if she could talk to you about anything. Especially when she was talking about something, a small smile would occasionally bloom in her dimples, which was quite lovely.</p>
<p>The reason we talked so much that time was mostly due to her opening the conversation.</p>
<p>She asked, "What is your surname?"</p>
<p>"Chu," I said, "Chu as in Savings Bank."</p>
<p>"And your ancestral home?"</p>
<p>"Jiangsu... Yixing."</p>
<p>She thought for a moment, as if she was pondering something, and said, "Oh, are you from that XX aristocratic family?"</p>
<p>(I am ashamed to say that I have never been very clear about my family history. Someone asked me before if I was from the XX aristocratic family, and I was still confused and didn't dare to admit it. That person then asked if Chu Dawen was my ancestor. I said yes, but I don't know how many generations ago he was. He said, "Then that must be it." But I still couldn't remember clearly what kind of aristocratic family it was. I forgot. When she said this to me, it seemed to fit in my memory, so I said yes).</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, she said this, and at that time, my feeling was twofold: one was the patriarchal society's concept of family status, which gave me a sense of pride, and the other was how she knew about such things, which gave me a sense of surprise.</p>
<p>I began to develop a respectful attitude towards her. I learned a little about her background.</p>
<p>Her ancestral home was in a prefecture in Anhui, and her family was also a family of scholars for generations. She said that her family still had an extremely old couplet, which was written by someone from my ancestors. She was taught to read by her father from a young age. Her father was a remnant of the Qing Dynasty and had already passed away. She had also studied at a girls' middle school in Nanjing for two years.</p>
<p>This beginning, in fact, showed that she was an intellectual, which was the main reason why we were able to talk so much. However, although the conversation started with talking about family history, most of the topics of conversation still lingered on events after the May Fourth Movement.</p>
<p>We talked so well that day that she almost didn't bother to pay attention to her child. The child didn't understand what we were saying and often looked at me with his bright black eyes. I couldn't tell if there was welcome or hatred in his eyes, but he still spent most of his time looking at the scenery.</p>
<p>From Xuzhou to Jinan, it takes about twelve hours. Daybreak in Xuzhou, nightfall in Jinan, just a whole day. That day, I didn't notice whether time was passing quickly or slowly. I thought, spending a whole day lying on the bunk alone, relying on imagination to cope with loneliness, would be quite pitiful. Thank goodness, she came to brighten up my journey.</p>
<p>I often fixed my gaze on her face. To me, it really didn't mean anything, but it seemed that just looking at her face was enough to make me forget everything else. She wasn't a beauty, but just her two dimples were enough to make her attractive to look at. Yes, as soon as she showed a slight smile, I felt as happy as if I had drunk a glass of wine. I can still roughly remember how pretty her eyes were.</p>
<p>But focusing my gaze so intently on someone's face is impolite and undignified. However, sometimes when I wasn't looking at her, she seemed to be sneaking glances at me.</p>
<p>This situation was the most poetic and interesting, although it was a bit flirtatious.</p>
<p>Her figure was still completely that of a young woman. I don't think anyone would dare to guess that she was already eighteen years old. Looking at her, she should be at most seventeen years old. A mother with a child doesn't move people much, but an older sister with a younger sister or brother would evoke an unspeakable, indescribable feeling.</p>
<p>I thought the child should be her younger brother. She was very gentle and caring towards him, but I seemed to have heard the child call her "Mom" once. Could it be that she was really a "Mom"? I wished she was still a Miss.</p>
<p>Jinan had arrived. No force could stop her from getting off the train. A servant who had come with her in third class now hurried to second class to help her with her luggage. I saw her off with a very mysterious nod.</p>
<p>But in the end, I still didn't know her last name. Don't you think I'm muddleheaded?</p>
