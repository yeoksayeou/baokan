<p>（一）太平洋之時代性</p>
<p>美前總統羅斯福曾有言曰。「地中海時代。早隨美洲之發現而消滅。大西洋時代。今日亦登峯造極。不久亦將耗竭其所有之元氣。惟有太平洋時代。方在破曉。其將爲古今來最偉大之時代者。氣數使然也。在此短簡之數語中。充分表現出太平洋之時代性。亦即充分表現出太平洋問題之嚴重性。强有力者之輕描淡寫。即太平洋上未來無限風波之象徵。羅斯福之謳歌太平洋。贊美太平洋。正所以確定太平洋前途之大刦。</p>
<p>太平洋何以爲今後最偉大之時代。一言以答之。即帝國主義者列强在地中海上與大西洋上殖民地及市塲瓜分完竣以後。太平洋上各弱小民族之市塲及資源。即將迅速變爲列强竸爭掠奪之目標。故所謂太平洋最偉大時代。即無異於謂太平洋將轉入列强角逐竸爭之嚴重時代。然而此偉大時代之到來。果眞如羅斯福所謂「氣數使然」歟。</p>
<p>自從剖割歐洲殖民地之歐洲大戰結束以後。帝國主義者列强獲得暫時之均勢。同時因爲戰時之疲勞各帝國主義者都需要充分之休息。以故世界局面得以暫時相安於一時。大戰後四五年。帝國主義者獲得重新之繁榮。而尤以美國與日本。一日千里。飛躍猛進。逹到資本主義之最高峯。資本主義之重新繁榮之日。亦即市塲問題殖民地問題重起爭端之時。太平洋上有極豐富未開墾之原料。有極廣大未開闢之市塲及投資地。其爲列强第二次竸奪之目的。自爲不可避免之命運。近人謂太平洋問題與曾引起歐洲第一次大戰之地中海問題。有同様嚴重之性質。爲未來戰爭之火藥庫，其言殆確而且當。</p>
<p>太平洋問題之核心。即太平洋問題之癥結。第一爲中國問題。第二爲移民問題。第三爲原料與市塲問題。中國擁地四百萬方哩。藏有無限未開發之富源。而又有佔世界四分之一之人口。足以爲帝國主義列强剩餘生産品之市塲。同時又足以爲其取之不竭有之不盡之大好資源地。故中國問題殆可謂爲太平洋問題之最中心問題。次之。近世以來。各國已大患人滿。各國政府反獎勵增殖。而人口乃更大增。日本國土極小。人烟本已患稠密。但據一九三零年統計。其本部人口爲六千四百四十四萬七千。合朝鮮台灣庫頁共爲九千零四十萬零四千人。較一九二五年增加六百九十四萬五千餘人。每年約增百萬餘人。自更感人滿爲患。不得不向外移民。然而極目宇内。東方已有美國移民律之頒佈。南方又高懸澳洲爲白人之澳洲之口號。南方又高懸澳洲爲北向太平洋上之中國。日本在中國勢力之增加。夫豈列强所甘。故移民問題又爲太平洋爭端紛起之難題。復次。太平洋上中國印度澳洲新西蘭等國家。都尙停滯在農業經濟之階段。産業極其落後。未開採之各種原料。幾於無可計數。世界工業先進國正感生産品堆積。原料恐慌。起而攘奪。固亦勢所必然。故原料與市塲問題。尤足以引起太平洋上之纠紛。總之。地中海問題即太平洋問題過去之模型。地中海問題所引起之第一次乾坤搏戰。亦不啻行將因太平洋問題而引起之世界大戰之初演。太平洋之將爲古今來最偉大之時代。人實爲之。非由氣數。羅斯福之言。固强有力者故作之豪語或趣語。適足予全世界弱小民族以無限之恐怖威脅耳。</p>
<p>環繞於太平洋四週之國家。至多亦至雜。如墨西哥秘魯智利巴拿馬安南等國。均無足輕重。於太平洋角遂之塲。并未有其地位。其實足以左右太平洋上局勢具有爭太平洋上覇權之力量者。則惟英日美三國而已。英國於歐戰前。本已在遠東植下特殊勢力。我國長江流域。早被視爲勢力範圍。絕不允他國動搖其毫末。而且海上覇王之王冠。英帝國主義者更不能讓他國欋取以去。對於太平洋問題上之角逐。自絲毫不肯放鬆。美國承歐戰之實惠。爲世界最大富翁。資本與貨物之堆積。亟需向外輸出。自更不得不向遠東廣大之市塲問鼎。羅斯福曾有言。我們將來的歷史。被面向中國的太平洋所决定的。較面向歐洲的大西洋爲多。其雄心可以概見。至於日本。雖因歐戰而國力激增。一躍而入於近世工業國家。但其國得天獨薄。原料極感缺乏。鐵與煤之缺少。尤爲其致命傷。爲拯其國脈。對於原料之攘奪。自不遺餘力。然而環顧世界。旣不能伸其鐵蹄以入美。又無法揚其魔掌襲歐。獨太平洋上地廣物博之中國。隔處最近。又懦怯可欺。故决定大陸政策。積極向我國東北部挺進。同時日本實際處於太平洋上。國力之雄厚。軍備之充足。亦無復讓於人。臥榻之側。豈容他人酣睡。太平</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>洋上覇主之王冠。决不肯拱手讓之他人。以此三國爲中心。更以世界其他各國綜錯複雜之關係從而推移激盪。而太平洋上。乃遂風雲變幻。波濤險惡。日加嚴重。</p>

<h3 id="c80">郭景鸞報告掘獲蔡烈士遺骸經過 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>蔡公時夫人郭景鸞、昨日下午五時、在公時中學招待本埠新聞界、到二十餘人、茲將郭女士報告掘獲蔡公時烈士遺骸經過情形如下、</p>
<p>（一）查起遺骸的動機　自蔡先烈等殉難後、景鸞於治喪旣畢、即要求政府及外部准許往濟查起遺骸、當時譚延　先生嘗告以烈士遺骸、傳在交署後團、須候將來濟案解决之後、再往收回、而王正廷先生亦囑以稍緩時日、備加慰藉、景鸞旣痛逝者、思立永久紀念、乃决心創辦公時學校、得諸黨國先進的贊助、躬赴海外募捐、去年回國、又急急於開辦學校、且濟案久懸未决、此事遂暫停頓、迄今年一月、山東省黨部舉發奸商張叔衡、以舊交署私租與日人、咨請魯政府收回該地、景鸞以先烈遺骸旣埋在該</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>署後園、日人竟化名租取其屋、其爲蓄謀泯滅五三慘案血蹟、已照然若揭、故即呈請中央黨部曁國府外部、請令魯省府收回該地、嚴懲奸商、并要求親往調查、乃因衰病的纏綿、與校務　牽、延至二月、始能成行赴濟、</p>
<p>（二）兩次赴濟的概况　景鸞抵濟南、即分謁黨政各機關、深得韓主席與何思源先生、曁黨政及民衆各團體的援助、結果、組織一紀念五三殉難烈士籌備會、其主要辦法、（一）在舊交涉署設烈士塚、（二）就該屋改建烈士祠、（三）鑄造蔡先烈銅像、（四）創辦五三學校、而於查起遺骸事、亦已妥籌辦法、準備開掘、適於此時、景鸞接京滬去電、報告海外捐欵建築校舍之華僑、委派代表回國、勘視校址、須與景鸞晤商、不獲已乃復遄返、歸後臥病、重以忙於校務的處置、迨開五三紀念會之後、仍赴濟、此次赴濟、除决盡力進行收回殉難之屋、確立先烈銅像、烈士祠、五三學校數事外、並於着手開掘遺骸、抵濟之後、接洽就緖、即趕赴北平、查詢當時由蔡先烈手創之民國大學情形、曾由北平黨政各機關、在北平中山公園開公祭蔡先烈大會、同時由該大會電請外部從速解决五三慘案、景鸞急於開掘先烈遺骸、六月廿一日即怱怱回濟、</p>
<p>（三）掘獲遺骸的實况　抵濟後、於二十三日開紀念五三烈士籌備會、第五次會議、决議於二十四日開掘、是日京鸞率同先烈遺族韓春孫五學榮及蔡先烈護兵申長勝等、并工人十名、赴舊外交署後園、當時先烈殉難地開掘、該地在園的西南隅、原爲工人取土之地、入土二尺餘、僅獲當日裹屍的蓆及綑綁的繩、均已腐爛、而不見何種骸骨、再下即爲硬土、深爲失望、然景鸞心殊不甘、仍令工人在附近搜扒、亦無所獲、二十五日仍在園之西南隅繼續獲掘、後園土鬆之地、一律掘開、遂在中間一地、掘獲日本水壼、軍用刀、夾馬鐙、皮帶等物、軍衣十餘件、雖未見骸骨、而景鸞細思、骸骨當亦在後園、仍着工人繼續尋掘、迄至下午五時、發掘該園西南隔、在距南牆約一丈、西牆約一丈五尺之地、入土僅五寸餘、即獲各烈士被日人所焚燒的骸骨、但見爲骸骨灰·頭骨·四支骨·盤骨·排骨·指骨·并有燒燬餘燼之軍用山東地圖·鞋底·衣服·皮帶·等件、傷心慘目、不忍卒睹、惟縱聲痛哭、以洩其哀嗣乃用紙包、逐一收集、置之磁盆中、并即報告各報館記者至交涉署、一面通知紀念五三烈士籌備會、分謁韓主席、及何思源先生諸人、同時并分電、以景鸞個人名義、報告國府外部、二十六日仍繼續掘取、收集完畢、而魯政府猶未有切當取締辦法、紀念五三烈士籌備會、則主張用磁缸裝好、暫行掩埋、景鸞認爲終不適當、恐生意外、景鸞親自拜見主席、已蒙准許帶歸、乃决收集骨灰於一箱、背負來京、於二十七晨由平浦南下、</p>
<p>（四）日領西田的震驚　駐濟日本領事西田、對於景鸞赴濟、查起遺骸的進行、與紀念五三籌備成立後的議案、聞已極爲注意、此次景鸞卒於掘獲已被日人焚化而謀掩滅慘案血蹟的先烈骨灰、一般在濟日人、旣甚惶駭、而西田尤爲震驚、已有詳電向日政府報告、但景鸞以爲日人以兇殘的暴力、慘殺外交官吏、開世界各國國際間未有之慣例、釀成五三慘案、此仇此恥、不唯中國民衆刻骨難忘、一息餘生、誓必湔雪、即世界主持人道公理之任何國家人民、亦已認識其野蠻的心腸、雖日人窮極巧妙的掩飾、與虚僞的宣傳、怎能容易掩蓋其事實、惟此骨骸、雖爲用火焚化、而終於掘獲、在我國民衆、更加認識其兇殘的面目與陰毒的手段、且足證實日人確爲在我國外交公署戕害我國外交官吏的一鐵證、將來對濟案的談判、當然要以此爲大前提的先决條件、同時希望世界主持人道公理的國家、亦應予我國以同情的援助、庶此後世界任何國際上、不要因此慘無人道的日本、而致創成戕害外交官吏的惡例、故我人對於日領西田、此次的震驚與報告、認爲日人欲蓋彌彰、心勞日拙、即便其在最近而創痕而惹起、更深一層的反感而已、</p>
<p>（五）安置遺骸的請求　景鸞原擬以遺骸送請中央黨部國府外交部審閱、至京時因慟哭太甚、疲頓不堪、而王外長又已來滬、越日適爲星期一紀念週、分謁各當局不遇、具呈文亦未草就、故回局稍作休息、現除電請蔣主席請示外、並分呈中央黨部國府曁行政院外交部請求、一·哀懇國府、准予俯念諸先烈爲國犠牲明令國葬、二·哀懇國府先派員接收諸先烈遺骸、報告經過、請其來京認閱骨骸、並同侍靈、此外尙通電國内報告詳况、而對於我國外交當局、亦將有相當的陳請、即對於世界各國、亦當有要求主持正義的呼籲、</p>

<p>本市華商電氣工人、因資方無誠意解决待遇條件、實行通車不售票、經社會局勸導後、當於前日下午五時一律復工、該局定今日調解、茲將各項情形分誌如下、</p>
<p>復工情形　前晚五時、工會除派交通隊分赴各處、飭各售票員遵令復工外、並佈告週知、及至五時半、所有一·二·三·四·路各電車售票員、一律照常售票、工會定今日上午十時、派周光榮·朱漢鶴·等代表三人、再往公司詢問總經理對於已簽字之九項條約、何時實行、如組織惠工委員會委員、何日可推出、醫藥事宜何日接洽、勞工人壽保險何日實行、二十年五月底前退休金、何日結算數目、</p>
<p>工會表示　新聲社記者、昨晤工會常務理事、據云、本會會員、因百物飛漲、血汗換來之工資、不敷餬口、故於三月二十五日經大會通過、提出改良待遇、奈資方毫無誠意、經社會局公安局市黨部迭次調解、始於五月二十八日、簽訂條件九條、規定六月一日起實行、尙有工人花紅及住宅問題、再自行協商、直至現在、九項條件、尙未實行、經工會屢次交涉無效、不昨已經代表大會議决、實行通車不賣票、以促覺悟、自接社會局批示後、當派代表與公司詢問、公司種種推諉、無切實答復、後經社會局徐直、一再勸導後、爲服從上級命令起見、即於下午五時、一律恢復原狀、如今日調解、公司仍無誠意接洽、當作第二步警告云云、</p>

<p>爭議要點　華商電氣勞資雙方爭議最烈、無法解决者、爲工人花紅及住宅兩問題、茲錄勞方所提出原案及理由如下、（一）（住宅）由公司撥欵二十萬元、購地皮建築工人住宅、限於二十年年終築成、在未築成以前、由公司發給房貼每人每月十元、築成後、如因不敷居住、致未住着工人住宅者、仍照給房貼、築成之工人住宅、爲公司所有産業、租與工人居住、其租金照購地及建築費用之總數、週息六厘計算、但工人住宅中之公用房屋、（如工人子弟學校及合作社等之房租、由公司負擔、）理由、工人住宅、在十六年條約中、早經規定、由公司覓地蓋造、但迄今已將四年、仍未實行、殊爲遺憾、故特定限二十年底以前建築完成、並請公司負擔築成以前之房貼、工人並非建築工程專家、所稱二十萬係假定數目、如築成之住宅不敷居住、自應仍由公司負擔房貼、造成之房屋、仍爲公司所有、收取房租、查十七八兩年、公司放欵及銀行來往、總數均在五十萬元以上、公司將欵存到銀行、也是生息、建築工人住宅、也是生息、與公司並無損失、不過公司對工人取息、不得過大、故請以六厘週息計算房租、此項住宅不特租費較爲便宜、因工人聚在一齊、容易辦理消費合作社等勞工事業、所以還可减少工人房租以外之生活費用、大约計算、每一工人家庭、住在工人住宅中者、每月可省十元開消、故在未築成以前、及築成以後、仍未住着工人住宅時、應由公司發給房貼每人每月十元、（二）花紅自二十年起、由董事會負責提出股東會通過、工人分配、每年純益金、不得小於二十一成之九成六厘、中以十分之六、專充勞工事業之基金、以十分之四、按照工資大小、分給於各工人、在一年度中、曾記過三次或記大過一次者、應得之盈餘减給一半、曾記過六次或記大過二次者應得之盈餘不給、减給或不給之盈餘、撥充勞工事業之經費、理由、按十八年四月、修正公司章程第五十五條十六年八月第五條、按前條約中十五分之三、等於公司章程二十一分之四成二厘、據前條約、工人得十五分之三中的十分之六、即二十五份之三、職員得十五分之三中的十分之四、即二十五分之二、又據公司章程股東共得二十一成中的十六成八厘、即共得二十五份之二十、所以分得盈餘的比例、工人與職員爲三與二之比、工人與股東爲三與二十之比、工人與職員人數比例、爲五與一之比、何以分記盈餘之比例、爲三與二呢、股東分得的盈餘、爲何又要爲職員和工人的四倍呢、我們百思不得其解、但是結果確很明白、就是有錢的人、得利多、富者愈富、没有資本出賣勞力的人、得利少、貧窮者永遠貧窮、孫總理說過、「我們國民黨的民生主義目的、就是要把社會上的財源弄到平均」、又說、「防備將來社會貧富不均的大毛病」現在分配盈餘的方法、就是造成這個大毛病的原因之一、在靑天白日之下、推行黨義的時候、當然不能容許這種致病的原因存在、經營公司的原素、爲資本與勞力、報酬大小、應照效能的高低而定、資本的報酬爲股息、勞力的報酬爲薪工、照理報酬可做效能高低的代表、現在事實未必如此、但是吃虧的、祇在賣勞力的工人、這是無可諱言的、現在我們認痛承認、現在的報酬、可以表示效能的高低、那麽最低限度、盈餘的分配、也要作照現的報酬未决定、公司十八年營業報告、職員薪水爲十二萬五千元、資本股息爲二十四萬元、工人工資三十三萬九千元、（零數不計）就是三種報酬的比例、職員爲一、資本爲二、實計爲一·九二、）工人爲三、（實計二·七三）就是工人應得盈餘總數之半、或者再承認公司章程中規定的二十一成中的一成、爲優先股之利益、八釐爲創辦人紅股之利益、還剩十九成二釐、工人祇少亦應得此十九成二釐的一半、所以我們要求、工人應得盈餘、不得少於二十一成中之九成六釐、我們應得的盈餘、遵照孫總理遺敎、作爲「改良勞動者之生活」的用途、拿十分之六專充勞工事實之基金、辦理改良金體會員生活的勞工事業、這様辦法、最爲合算、同時顧到各會員的特殊情形、把其餘一部份、分給各會員自已支配、因過失减給及不給盈餘、是遵照工廠法第四十條之規定、至於减給及不給之盈餘、非公司應得之利益、故請撥充勞工事業之經費、</p>

<p>越捕與西探均受傷</p>
<p>昨日下午三時許、法租界拉都路一染坊店被盜、當時適遇西探·越捕·巡查經過、雙方開槍互轟、結果、格斃一盜、西探越捕亦各受重創茲將詳情錄后、</p>
<p>染坊突來五盜　法租界拉都路三百九十三號至六號門牌、爲張姓開設之染織廠、牌號錦華、營業尙稱發逹、不料竟爲匪徒所垂涎、昨日下午三時許、突來盜匪五人、各御長短不一之各式衣裝、兩盜執有手槍、入門後、先將該號所有店夥傭人等衆、一齊驅紮一室、然後分頭恣意搜刦、</p>
<p>夥友暗隨盜後　衆盜在室内搜索殆遍、除各種絲織外、餘無長物、此種易於辨識之顯然贓物、衆盜均棄如敝屣、祇將一職員手上之金戒一只、順攫而去、盜等乃懊喪門而逸、其時該號有夥友某甲、性甚機警、乃暗躡衆盜之後、待機而動、</p>
<p>盜與捕均中槍　衆盜出門後、一直向北而逃、某甲跟踪緊隨、直尾抵拉都路辣斐德路相近、詎離該廠約三百餘碼遠近、適該處立有一百十二號三道頭越捕某甲、乃向其密告、越捕亟出槍向衆盜轟擊、一盜應聲而倒、餘盜亦亂槍還擊、該捕腰際命中一彈、當即負痛倒地、</p>
<p>西探兩足受傷　當亂彈横飛之際、適有法捕房特别機關政治部西探馬姆郎乘坐汽車返拉都路九十七號寓所、目擊越捕倒地、當亦不顧危險、持槍躍下汽車、與匪互轟、結果該探足部被擊中兩彈、流彈並擊傷一乘黄包車之俄人、捕房聞警、立派探捕、趕往兜拿、四匪已逃逸無踪、在傷盜身畔、檢獲手槍一支、即將受傷各人、與盜匪分别車送醫院醫治、</p>

<h3 id="c115">蘇省廿年度敎費預算案（時章） <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>滿收滿支總數爲四百八下八萬元</p>
<p>比上年度少一萬六千五百五二元</p>
<p>時日過得眞快、十九年度、業已完了、二十年度、又復來臨、記者去年此時、正在搜集「江蘇省十九年度敎育經費預算述要的」的材料（那篇見十九年七月十九·二十二十一諸日本報）、而二十年度的蘇省敎費槪算、現在又告成立、江蘇爲首善省區、敎育經費早經獨立、數目也比别省大些、所以關心這事的很多、茲就記者聞見所及、將二十年度的預算案分述於後、</p>
<h3 id="c116">（一）預算成立之經過 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>今年二月初、江蘇省政府通令全省各機關、所有二十年度的預算案、一律限於二月底造送財政廳彙編、依據江蘇敎育經費委員會的組織原則、編製預算是該會職權之一所以該會就於二月二十七日在鎭江江蘇敎育廳舉行第二十三次會議、出席的委員在葉楚傖·陳和銑·吳敬恒·鈕永建·陳其采·鄭陽和·柳詒徵·高陽·汪懋祖·馬客談·顧毓琇等十一人、爲預算的問題、足足討論了五個鐘頭｜下午三時二十分至八時二十分、結果只規定了二十年度省敎育的收入數、計</p>
<p>田賦劃撥欵　二、五ＯＯ、ＯＯＯ元</p>
<p>屠宰稅　六五Ｏ、ＯＯＯ元</p>
<p>牙稅　六五Ｏ、ＯＯＯ元</p>
<p>（以上三項、爲敎費管理處的收入、共爲三、八ＯＯ、ＯＯＯ元、）</p>
<p>省庫補助　三ＯＯ、ＯＯＯ元</p>
<p>各校學宿費等　一八Ｏ、ＯＯＯ元</p>
<p>財部撥選欠欵　六ＯＯ、ＯＯＯ元</p>
<p>共計　四、八八Ｏ、ＯＯＯ元</p>
<p>并議决、由敎育廳就此範圍、參配事實上的需要、編列支出預算、提會討論、這是確定歲入的情形、</p>
<p>敎育廳接到上項决議之後、即着手編製關於支出方面的預算、但是收入總數、比較上年减少、支出方面、原有的不特不能削减、而事實上非增加不可的且很多、如中小學的自然添級、初中的增加敎學鐘點、各中學添設職業科、鄉師添級設備、江北農民敎育館、敎育學院添级、社敎機關自然發展費等等、總數逹二十六萬二千元、都是絕不能少的、所以敎育廳在此情形之下、斟酌增調、支配編列、非常困難、同時、又須催促學校等、先行編送審核、文電往返、頗費時日、因此、直至五月底才把這部分工作做完、前後差不多費了三個月的工夫、</p>
<p>敎育廳已收「二十年度省敎育預算支配大綱草案」擬定、敎費委員會暫定於六月十二日召集第廿四次會議、剛好、那時正是四届五中全會開會的時候、葉吳各委員均不能來省、所以改期於廿三日舉行、出席委員和上次差不多、花了四個鐘頭、｜三時三十五分至七時四十分｜總算把支出的槪數解决了、現在將各項槪數列后、并和上年度的比較比較、</p>
<p>項别　二十年度數目　十九年度數目　比較情形</p>
<p>一、高等敎育經費　一、三三九、一五二元　一、三九九、一五二元　無增减</p>
<p>二、普通敎育經費　二、四七二一０一元　二、三０四一０一元　增一六八、０００元</p>
<p>三、社會敎育經費　六三０、五八七增　五四二、一六一元　曾八八、０００元</p>
<p>四、留學經費　一七五、０００元　一七二０００元　無增减</p>
<p>五、其他機關經費　一０七、七七二元　　七八、五二二元　增二九、二五０元</p>
<p>六、總預備費　九五、三八八元　　三九七、一九０增　减三０一、八二元</p>
<p>共計　四、八八０、０００元　四、八九六、五五二元　减一六五五二元</p>
<p>觀右所列、上年度和本年度的比較、内容雖各有增减而總數方面則今年定减少一萬六千五百五十二元、其關鍵全在總預備費之移挪也、（按中央頒布的試辦預算章程、預備費應占總數百分一至五、現在總預備費九五·三八八元、還不足總數四·八八Ｏ·ＯＯＯ元的百分之二云、）</p>
<p>（待續）</p>
<p>關於編譯事項</p>
<p>一、繼續編訂民衆應用字彙、二、繼續編輯鄉村用三民主義千字課、三、繼續編譯科學名詞、</p>
<p>關於審查敎科圖書事項</p>
<p>一、繼續審查中小學校及民衆學校各科敎書及敎授書、二、繼續審查兒童讀物、三、繼續審查敎育用儀器標本、四、繼續審查國恥史外交史及有關於黨義之書籍、</p>

<p>倫敦四日電　第五十五届温布登世界網球大會、開賽以來已两星期、今日全部結束、單打無决賽、興趣大减、美國共計得三項錦標、德國一種、英國一種、</p>

<p>温布登賽告總結束</p>
<p>第五十五届温布登世界網球大會結束、矣、其中經過、變化無窮、殊足玩味也、</p>
<p>美國少年選手可畏　加入之二百五十選手中、最足令人驚佩、即得男單打决賽權之美國二十歲少年希爾士、十九歲伍特、少年英俊、横掃天下英雄、美國網球之前途、殆可限量哉、而洛德范令之雙打、亦舉世無敵、鐵爾盾之預測、未失英雄眼光也、</p>
<p>法國全軍覆沒可驚　最可驚人者爲法國選手之全軍覆沒、柯顯脫第一週即敗於無名英雄夏伯、鮑塞斯於第四週亦淘汰、鮑羅屈拉複賽又敗、最有希望之雙打、亦爲美克服、竟片甲不回、殊出人意料也、</p>
<p>英國滿腔熱血消散　今年英國隊大具奪標雄心、實力之强、歷年之冠、如白里、奥斯汀雄心勃勃、惜單打雙打仍全敗於美人之手、一腔熱血爲之消散、女子冠軍納納脫女士、名落孫山、最塂痛心、差幸最後仍一女子雙打錦標、稍可安慰、</p>
<p>日本實力相去尙遠　日本之實力、相去尙遠、五選手中、佐籐次郎、成績最佳、單打戰至半複賽而敗於鮑羅屈拉、</p>
<p>說到台維斯杯形勢</p>
<p>温布登大會旣畢、台維斯杯决賽又將開始、耀武揚威之美國、希望驟然大增、英國雖必勝捷克、恐仍非美國敵手、美法之决戰、又將舉世轟動矣</p>

<p>全週僅開三日成交四千數百萬</p>
<p>市上需要續暢價較前復漲甚勁</p>
<p>上星期本埠證劵市塲各公債市况、除週一辦理六月份期貨交割、週三四因係上半届結帳均停市外全週僅有三日市面、期貨交易尙稱活動、八月期貨多已先後開出、計於三日間共成交四千二百十六萬五千元、内二十年開稅交易仍最多、佔一千六百五十一萬元、其他各債較靜、如一九關五百萬元、一九善四百七十二萬元、二十年捲烟六百七十八萬五千元、裁兵三百三十四萬五千元、編遣三百零八萬五千元、九六公債一百六十五萬元、整理六釐七十一萬元、關稅三十萬元、又七年一萬五千元、久已無市之金融長期忽亦成交四萬五千元、現貨則寥落如前、全週祇做開四萬四千元、中惟一九關佔二萬二千元、餘均祇數千元、至言上星期三日間各債劵市價之變動情形、則爲時局形勢殊佳、債市環象頗可樂觀、故市上人心良好、各方投资買進、勢殊活潑、而觀賣方情况、則以受現品偍供之限制、遠期賣出、除有現品外、絕對不能抛空、近期亦以慮受軋空、不敢多賣、以是買方人氣、遂遠較賣出爲旺、各債劵市價因求供形勢懸殊、較前益形堅俏、每日步漲、勢殊純一、查其變動經過、惟週二價互有漲跌、上落穩和、週五計二O關漲逾二元、二O捲裁兵一九關編遣等均漲一元至一元六七角、週五計一九關善二O關捲均漲一元半左右、裁兵九六各漲一元餘、結果比前星期如二O關捲各漲二三元、其他亦多好一元數角、僅金融七年趨勢較疲云、茲將三日間各債價之高低漲跌統計分列於後、（單位元）</p>

<p>上週紗市直趨下游、因某巨商將多頭大量賣出、於是散戶大起恐怖、據一部份云、有翻空之說、故形勢愈虚、實銷較滯、一半以節前吸收太多、二則期紗跌風跌劇烈、各帮雖有進胃、皆束手不辦、因此生意較爲冷澹、至於金市亦　泊不定、致人心更形恍惚、目前紗市完全受人力影響、照大勢狀况有立定之可能、前途如何、殊難逆料、客帮買去現紗統計五千五百八十四包、同行中進二千三百包、行情二十支日紗尙平、本紗跌二三兩、標紗價各月比前週跌二·三兩不等、成交計十四萬五千六百五十包、大阪三品紗平平、茲將各帮口買去之包額分誌於左、</p>

<p>棉市在上週間市氣較爲平疲、毫無精彩可言、因實銷暗澹、美棉雖漲、而金市市趨軟、且紗市一蹶不振、壓力尤重、致人心愈弱、但日商購進期新棉包額殊巨、標棉各月價比上週跌四五六錢、全週成交統計二十萬零二千五百擔、來源計姚花九百包、木架花五百九十包、美棉與上週相仿、廠商進胃大淸、祇有陜西花二百件云、</p>

<p>新閘　昨日各路到船不多、市形爽暢、蘇常厚粳買戶尤湧、頂貨及中關各增一二角、際此貨少存薄之際、而各店胃亦呆、致本城進意濃厚、價遂再行復提、杜埠尖亦漸覺枯微、早晚稻來貨略稀、内地與轉口二帮略有動辦、本街進胃遂注重河來各秈、因前日略增、故買方欲轉平後再進、是以一度呆木、昨市形勢忽變、竟隨厚粳上漲一尺半、糯米雖呈堅穩、然有向上之勢、昨由太古公司輪船裝到洋米一艘、計敏黨米及小絞米約七萬餘包、客帮不動、本街亦祇零星而已、市氣平庸、</p>
<p>滬南　昨日來源十數號、各帮銷塲甚殷、蘇常厚粳初頗平穩、向歸閘北漲風、早間開盤各好一二角、内中頂次各貨略有出入、平黎白粳統提尺許、買方態度自小暑前來源必旺、故祇隨進隨出、靑角泗松薄稻一致上升近角、而貨客尙不願多售、杜洋尖河下來貨甚爲凋零、惟日存尙有、大盤喊起一尺、白元陰化隨到隨銷、價無上落、</p>

<p>昨日星期、五金交易緣受霉雨影響、益覺寥落、全市開出各貨除本廠元釘跌價錢半、售七兩三錢、有千餘箱成交外、别貨點綴甚少、惟綠鐵絲布昨市開出亦有六七十箱、行情雜牌十七兩、鷄牌十七兩七錢半、花旗貨二十二兩、黑鐵皮昨市問津者益多、惜成交者異常寥少、價則三六尺售十兩零二錢半、二六尺十一兩五錢云、</p>

<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>戀愛這種東西。好像是輪盤賭。又好像是投機事業。假使你要保全你的財産。最好是不要和它接觸。</p>
<p>丈夫們像鐘表一様。假使你不加開動。他就會生起銹來。不聽你的指揮。假使你時時刻刻的在開動他。他亦將爆斷了發條。停止其工作。</p>
<p>在從前。要得到一個女人的愛和一個異性之吻。實比釣魚還難。非有眞正的本領。和耐心的守候。决難成功。然而事到如今。愛情和接吻已像巧格力糖一様的流行。隨時隨地都可以獲得的了。</p>
<p>人類是一動愼於看様的動物。所以自熱女郎克拉拉寳出了名後。地球上就陡增了許多妖媚的女子。</p>
<p>虹廟裏的香燭。紅頭阿三的黑鬚。晚上人肉市塲的展覽。和開開金龍手的追逐。都是上海南京路上的特色。初到上海者必以先睹爲快。</p>
<p>只有愚人們。相信着敎員的言語。句句都是金科玉律。</p>
<h3 id="c145">旅館中應有的設施 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>防止自殺之我見</p>
<p>近來一般因抱厭世主義。紛紛動身到别一世界者。日見增多。且大抵假旅館爲歸宿之所。夫旅館本爲旅客託足及男女幽會之塲。係爲生而設。非爲死而設也。乃今竟有如此作用。誠非創設者始料所及。故欲防止自殺。非從此根據地求一消弭之法不可。鄙人目擊心傷。爰爲經營旅館業者。借箸一籌。速作下列之設施</p>
<p>（一）附設檢查處　檢查處設主任一人。男女檢查員各一人。須以目光銳利。善觀氣色者充之。凡有雙雙男女。或單身旅客投止。如見其舉止失常。形跡可疑。即照「抄靶子」辦法。一一施以檢查。有無夾帶雅片安眠藥等毒物。一經查獲。即將該毒物充公。並温言開導。謝絕棲止。各旅邸均同一辦法。若輩以所如輒阻。動身爲難。自然回心轉意。打消自殺之念。</p>
<p>（二）廣貼標語　猶憶去年社會局。因投浦自盡者衆。特在沿浦各碼頭。豎立標語。施行以來。頗著成效。黄浦同志。遂見减少。現各旅館大可效法。凡廳堂及房間。甚至厠所浴室床帳。均須遍貼種種勸告的標語。並說明自殺後靈魂之痛苦。喚醒痴迷。彼意圖自殺者。獨居靜對。觸目驚心。怕死之念。必油然而生矣。</p>
<p>以上二則。如能履行。枉死城中。必可减却幾許冤魂。吾謹合十以祝曰。「大慈大悲。救苦救難。救命王菩薩。」</p>
<h3 id="c146">由動物之形態舉動預知天候之變化 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 愛峯</p>
<p>犬貓之反對個性與天候　　古人有「人心之不同。如其面焉」之語。頗覺陳腐。又評論人之性質。不相投合。有如犬猿之語。是亦不免黴臭。然於其間。實有惹人尋味之處。</p>
<p>吾人觀察自然與人類兩界。犬與猿兩物。共同居處之現象。除沿街戲猴輩所能役使之外。可云絕無。又親子間。如置之異地。至一月之久。而相反噬。如同仇敵。此吾人所常目擊。况屬種不同之犬與猿。其磨牙相見。自是當然。然古人不曾以犬與貓爲對照物。足使吾人發生疑問。犬與貓二者。無論何時何地。皆得見之。而其絕不相容之反對性。毋庸贅言。即兩者對於天候。亦得預知其相異。是誠有特殊趣味。如犬咬草時。翌日必晴。貓咬草時。翌日當雨是也。此現象之的中率。雖無數字的統計。但比馬嘶必晴。牛鳴必風之確實性較多。而深信其無訛。</p>
<p>牛及貓之形態及其舉動</p>
<p>（一）牛之垂涎長則晴　「牛涎三千丈」之句。未免形容過甚。牛涎之長短。因日而異。斯乃常人所未注意之點。此亦由牛之使用度。隨之不同。如積載貨物之輕重。及道路之遠近等。與有關係焉。且以少數牛之觀察。不易判斷。自不待言。故有注意當日之天候。及數多牛車之必要。若牛之垂涎。有幾及地面之現象。則天候必晴。以二三年間統計之結果而言。除酷熱之夏天外。如非晴天。則此現象。殆不可見。</p>
<p>（二）貓洗面之形式　貓之前足下面。摩擦顔面之動作。謂之洗面。其形式有二。</p>
<p>一·其動作僅限於顔部。是眞洗面。二·其動作及於後頭部。頻擦左右兩耳。是特殊情形。然前者必晴。後者必雨。至其的中率如何。固難明言。至少亦有過半數之確實性。但反之雨前貓必擦耳之逆現象。則又未必然也。</p>
<h3 id="c147">「小帳」的統計 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>小帳。又名酒錢。以文雅之詞出之。則曰犒賞。吾人偶進交際塲所。幾無處無「小帳制度」之流行。數年前。曾聞某君言。其家有電話。一次爲陰曆年底。有某號接線生竟於電話之中。向其索酒錢者。則酒錢之風行可知。社會上固無一人不喜之矣。</p>
<p>最近。英國政府舉行一「小帳之調查」ＴｉｐｐｉｎｇＣｅｎｓｕｓｏ冀以探知社會上此種惡習慣之近况而欲設法加以改良之也。</p>
<p>據其調查之結果。則謂各處雇員之得小帳最多者爲大旅館中之脚夫。次之則爲各旅館及各飲店及其他公共塲所之男女待役。倫敦有某大旅館之脚夫領袖及某處一總侍役。每禮拜所得的小帳。必在五金鎊以上。亦足駭人矣。其他如女招待之類。每禮拜所得亦在二金鎊以上。即營業之最淸淡者。至少亦有五先令至十先令之額外進欵。此等人視「小帳」爲唯一之利源。區區月薪。固不在其心目中也。</p>
<p>倫敦爲世界繁華之區。故倫敦人士偶行至交際塲所。其所出之小帳常較他人爲慷慨。最普通者以「一成」爲例。譬如在一飲食店中進餐。餐费一元即須付不帳一角是也。而最小之限度。則男招待爲三便士女招待爲二便士耳。倫敦以外各地。小帳制度。其盛况殊大遜於倫敦。美國人士昔年曾盛行此制。今則已改良不少矣。</p>
<p>至於我國。社會上固亦盛行此惡習慣也。第以無統計可考。不能知其詳况。然就余之理想推測之。則如各大旅館之茶房以及其他公共塲所之男女待役。其所得之小帳。必不遜於倫敦。而在上海特殊情形之下。女招待之所得。自較勝於男招待多多也。國民政府昔年曾有「禁止犒賞」之令。深望社會人士之留意於此惡習慣之推廣也。</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>華嚴經。一切諸佛世界。悉見如來坐蓮華寳師子之座。故佛座稱爲蓮座。而王子安更有蓮座神容儼。松崖聖跡餘之句。蓋蓮之爲花。亭亭淨植。自與仙佛爲緣也。予嘗謂於巨蓮花朶中。着一裸美人。更具玉潔冰淸之妙。不料久涉綺想者。今竟於上海公司所攝之「東方夜譚」影片中見之。當阿彌國王。宴會羣英之際。逞奇鬥艷。百戲雜陳。而蓮花美人。於是乎冉冉而出。蓮大似龕。以頗黎紙爲之。通體瑩明。此豸娟娟。掩乳含羞於其中。旣而機捩觸發。蓮瓣悉舒展而下垂。色相露呈。乃盈盈起舞。作時下之歌。厥聲冷然如戞玉。而藕臂蘭胸。更令人心旌搖曳。此境祇應天上有。人間難得幾回看。洵眼福已。</p>

<p>「第一句，不是别來無恙麽？我已把别字去掉，替他改一個離字。離來無恙，豈不比他高明些？」</p>
<p>「高明之至！謝謝你！請你下樓去罷！我被你閙得一些事情也不能做，此刻你索性替我來做了。」</p>
<p>夫人聽了，一言不發，走到門口，立了一會，開口了：</p>
<p>「我不上來，你不下去，好不好？」</p>
<p>子良立刻動筆，不去睬伊，伊到底下樓了。子良定定心，才改了半篇只聽得樓下的夫人，又在那裏呌了。</p>
<p>「子良！」</p>
<p>子良那裏敢答應，一答應，伊必定就上來了，所以兀自不開口。</p>
<p>「子良！你下來！」</p>
<p>子良一想：不好！不要是伊呌我下去吃飯麽？朝晨呌我下去，乃是吃粥，我不下去，伊就把粥吃完，此刻若是吃飯，我不答應，怕又要吃不到了，所以要問伊一個明白。</p>
<p>「子良！你下來不下來？」</p>
<p>「什麽事？」</p>
<p>夫人不回答，子良只聽下面叮叮叮一陣響，原來夫人把筷子，敲着飯碗，這明明是吃飯的暗號啊。可笑！伊竟當我是一隻猫，還是一隻狗。子良了來不及細想，就此放了筆：</p>
<p>「是吃飯麽？」</p>
<p>下面也不答。</p>
<p>子良走下樓去，一看，當眞夫人已經先吃了。</p>
<p>「我問你，怎麽不回答。」</p>
<p>「我一口的飯，還能說話麽？」</p>
<p>子良見桌上，兩碗焦黄色的飯，三碗菜。細細看時，不免又生氣了：</p>
<p>「討厭！怎麽又是黄豆芽！除了黄豆芽，就沒有别的菜麽？」</p>
<p>他躊躇着不吃。</p>
<p>「黄豆芽，我方才問過你，你說好，才去買的啊！」</p>
<p>「何曾問過我？」</p>
<p>「我說銀魚炒腰子，好不好？你說好的。銀魚炒腰子，便是黄豆芽的别名啊！」</p>

Our side did not acknowledge this, but the other side is still conducting military operations there. (5th Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Japanese police in Wanbaoshan shot and killed Chinese farmers, public sentiment has become increasingly agitated. Koreans, under the instigation of the Japanese side, have repeatedly provoked. Chinese officials are doing their best to prevent Chinese people from taking rash actions, but the Japanese side has continuously increased military and police forces, opening fire and arresting people as if facing a formidable enemy. It is estimated that 38 shots have been fired, causing many deaths and injuries, and more than ten people have been arrested, with their lives unknown. Local authorities have urgently telegraphed the Shenyang Political Committee to request instructions on how to resolve the situation. (5th Day Special Telegram)</p>

The Incheon Police Department has dispatched its entire armed police force to prepare to retake it. A Chinese silk shop and a barber shop were vandalized.

(5th Day Electric Communication Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Kyoto: The Korean group, agitated by the Wanbaoshan Incident, turned into a riot yesterday afternoon. Two hundred people carried clubs and attacked the Chinese residential area of ​​Xixiaomencho.

<p>The Supervisory Committee's Handling of the Guangdong Incident is Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member talked about the Guangdong incident, saying that it had been more than two months since it happened. At first, it seemed like a big storm was brewing, and even they themselves were on the verge of infighting. Most of the leaders are passive. Although the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee decided to refer the case to the Supervisory Committee for discussion, the Supervisory Committee generally hopes that the other party will realize their mistakes sooner or later and will not pursue past offenses. It can be seen from the fact that the Central Government has never increased a single soldier on the Hunan-Guangdong border. When Chiang was about to leave, he said to his colleagues, "If we defeat the Communists, they will naturally realize their mistakes." In short, the Guangdong incident is different from the changes of Feng and Yan. Therefore, the Supervisory Committee proposed to postpone it temporarily and submit it to the Fourth National Congress for a proper solution. (5th Day Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e7">The Cause of the Kang-Tibetan Conflict <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A representative from Tibet stationed in Beijing spoke about the causes of the Kang-Tibetan conflict. One was the religious dispute between the Bairi and Dajie temples, which was not handled in accordance with the customs of the lama temples, leading to the expansion of the conflict. Second, someone used the border army to secretly help the Bairi Temple attack and seize Tibetan land. The reason why this case has not been resolved is that the Central Government's envoy was too late to set off, causing both sides to misunderstand due to rumors. However, the Kang and Tibetan armies have long obeyed the order to cease military action, and the people of western Kang have repeatedly telegraphed for help because of the Dajie's independent actions, which are unrelated to the Tibetan army. The Tibetan army has only been defending itself in its original defense area from beginning to end. Now that Tang Ke-san has left the pass, all the truth will be clear, and impartial mediation will not be difficult to achieve, so as to achieve peace. (5th Day Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e22">Cultivation of Youth <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The reporter has previously stated that it is imperative for youth to create their own paths and find their own way out. However, creation is not easy to talk about. If one usually lacks sufficient cultivation, one will naturally lack the ability to handle matters when faced with them. Therefore, please allow me to further discuss the issue of youth cultivation. The goal of youth cultivation today should be the "three nots," namely, not being confused, not being worried, and not being afraid. Why do I say this? At the crossroads, many paths diverge. Phenomena are presented in a disorderly manner, and many opinions are offered. Where to go and what to do, one is lost and helpless. The disease lies in confusion. Human desires flow rampant, unable to restrain oneself in a narrow world, imprisoning the universe. Worrying about life and death, fearing gains and losses. The disease lies in worry. Following blindly, being decadent, indecisive, and cowardly in the face of events. The disease lies in fear. With these three diseases, this is why youth today are drowning in a sea of ​​misery and unable to free themselves. Understanding these root causes and exploring remedies means how to seek not being confused, not being worried, and not being afraid. In a word, the wise are not confused, the benevolent are not worried, and the brave are not afraid. The wise are knowledgeable. From oneself to society, from human nature to physics, from the smallest atom to the largest universe, daily phenomena are all known for their inevitability and their reasons. A clear mind and decisive judgment will never lead to great confusion and helplessness. This is how wisdom cures confusion. The benevolent are humane. With great personality and broad minds, they seek to do their best regardless of the outcome. "Producing without possessing, doing without relying." Understanding their losses, they are indifferent to success or failure. They can naturally be full of interest and find themselves at home wherever they go. This is how benevolence cures worry. The brave are strong. With a bright heart, they are upright and frank, full of righteousness. To the greatest extent, they look down on the universe. They see heaven and earth as small. With an even stronger will, they can be decisive, speaking loudly and walking boldly, cutting through thorns without any fear. This is how courage cures fear. If one possesses these three virtues, I do not believe that they cannot create a happy paradise in the barren desert. Those youths who are suspicious, depressed, sad, and suffering today, why not try these three principles?</p>

<p>Chinese Businesses Suspend Operations in Protest</p>
<p>National Telegram from Guers, 4th: The "Nors Democrat" newspaper here reports that under pressure from local authorities, the state of Sonora, Mexico, is facing a shortage of general merchandise (equivalent to Chinese groceries). If the current government does not mediate the overlapping taxes levied on general merchandise and food, this shortage will soon become a reality. The purpose of the multiple taxes levied by the Mexican authorities is to expel the numerous Overseas Chinese who operate general merchandise businesses. Consequently, Chinese businesses have suspended operations in protest and are appealing to the Sonora state government, hoping to abolish this unequal treatment. Furthermore, the state has implemented a new labor law requiring that 80% of all store employees be Mexican. This law will also cause countless Chinese to lose their jobs and force Chinese businesses to close, as the Mexican anti-Chinese committee is actively working to expel Chinese throughout the country, and the situation of Overseas Chinese in Sonora is even more dire.</p>

<p>Reaching a Final Agreement</p>
<p>Germany Expresses Gratitude</p>
<p>Reparations Conference to be Convened This Month</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 5th: French and American representatives continued their meeting from Saturday evening until 1:00 AM this morning and reached complete agreement on President Hoover's debt suspension plan. France also agreed to the UK's proposal to convene a conference of relevant countries. The grace period for Germany's suspension of reparations payments has been compromised to twelve years. Furthermore, France will not be required to deposit a guarantee of £25 million with the Bank for International Settlements. However, an agreement on the third issue, France's demand that Germany continue to pay reparations in goods, was not reached until the meeting adjourned this morning. Currently, the two countries have generally reached an agreement on Hoover's proposal, with only some minor issues and procedures remaining to be discussed. It has been decided that the agreed-upon points will be recorded in the minutes of the meeting to ensure credibility, and drafting is expected to begin within the next day or two. During this meeting, US Treasury Secretary Mellon and Ambassador Edge first met with French Foreign Minister Briand to discuss President Hoover's views on the points agreed upon on Sunday and his demands on the points not yet agreed upon, and a new memorandum was submitted to Briand, who immediately presented it to the cabinet meeting. After a two-and-a-half-hour cabinet meeting, Briand, Laval, and others discussed the matter with the American representatives until midnight, and a complete resolution was reached. As France has agreed to the UK's proposal to convene a conference of relevant countries, it is expected to be held in Paris in July.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 5th: With the exception of the National People's Party, most German newspapers have expressed their joy at the agreement reached between the US and France. Today, a spokesman for the German cabinet told the Associated Press representative that although the Paris agreement contains some revisions that are unfavorable to Germany, Germany is very grateful. It is rumored that the German government intends to send a telegram of thanks to President Hoover as soon as it officially receives the agreement.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 4th: The announcement last night that the US and France had reached an understanding was a bit premature, as the US and French meetings were still under intense discussion all day today. This afternoon, US Treasury Secretary Mellon and French Finance Minister Flandin spent two hours discussing the matter. Afterwards, Mellon used the transatlantic cable to speak with President Hoover for a long time, and there was a very detailed discussion of the points of contention between the US and France. Subsequently, Mellon sent a memorandum to French Prime Minister Laval, who immediately convened a cabinet meeting after receiving the memorandum to discuss the new American memorandum repeatedly. It was not until 9:00 PM that the US and French authorities reconvened. Political circles expect that the final meeting today will surely reach a substantive agreement. However, regardless of the terms of the agreement, Hoover's plan may not be implemented immediately after its establishment, as some of the points requested by France have already been conceded by the United States, and further consultations will be required with other countries that have signed the Young Plan. Some of these points may be difficult for other countries to accept, including the United Kingdom. Although US Treasury Secretary Mellon kept in touch with the British Foreign Office during the US-French negotiations, it cannot be said that the UK has no objections. As for the content of the US-French understanding, it is still difficult to obtain a reliable report. What is known is that the United States has recognized France's demands, such as the unconditional annuities in Germany's reparations still needing to be paid, and that the loans obtained by Germany will not be directly handed over to the German government, but to the German State Railway, etc. Furthermore, France will be exempt from paying the guarantee to the Bank for International Settlements.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th: US Acting Secretary of State Castle said this afternoon, after speaking with Treasury Secretary Mellon by telephone and consulting with President Hoover and Acting Treasury Secretary Mills for two hours, that there had been no change in the status of the war debt negotiations and that the US and France were in agreement on all major points. Mellon will meet with the French Finance Minister again today, and another telephone call is expected from the US this afternoon to report on everything, he said. After consulting with the Acting Secretary of State and others, President Hoover left for his summer residence in Rapidan and is not expected to return to Washington until Monday.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 4th: As the outcome of President Hoover's proposed suspension negotiations remains uncertain, optimism on the stock exchange has been greatly reduced. Today, major securities fell by seven to nine pounds each.</p>

<p>(I) The Temporality of the Pacific Ocean</p>
<p>Former US President Roosevelt once said: "The Mediterranean era has long disappeared with the discovery of the Americas. The Atlantic era is also reaching its peak today and will soon exhaust all its vitality. Only the Pacific era is just dawning, and it will be the greatest era in ancient and modern times. This is due to the destiny of the times." In these few words, the temporality of the Pacific Ocean is fully expressed, as is the seriousness of the Pacific issue. The lightheartedness of the powerful is a symbol of the infinite storms that will occur on the Pacific Ocean in the future. Roosevelt's praise and admiration for the Pacific Ocean is precisely to confirm the great calamity of the Pacific's future.</p>
<p>Why will the Pacific Ocean be the greatest era in the future? In a word, after the imperialist powers have completed the division of colonies and markets on the Mediterranean and Atlantic Oceans, the markets and resources of the weak and small nations on the Pacific Ocean will rapidly become the target of competition and plunder by the powers. Therefore, the so-called greatest era of the Pacific Ocean is no different from saying that the Pacific Ocean will enter a serious era of competition and rivalry among the powers. However, is the arrival of this great era really "due to the destiny of the times," as Roosevelt said?</p>
<p>Since the end of the European War, which dissected the European colonies, the imperialist powers have obtained a temporary balance. At the same time, because of the fatigue of the war, all the imperialist powers needed a full rest. As a result, the world situation was able to remain temporarily at peace for a while. In the four or five years after the war, the imperialist powers achieved renewed prosperity, especially the United States and Japan, which leaped forward by leaps and bounds, reaching the highest peak of capitalism. The day of the renewed prosperity of capitalism is also the time when market problems and colonial problems re-emerge. The Pacific Ocean has extremely rich uncultivated raw materials and extremely vast undeveloped markets and investment sites. It is the inevitable destiny for it to become the target of the second competition among the powers. Recent people say that the Pacific issue has the same serious nature as the Mediterranean issue, which caused the first European War, and is a powder keg for future wars. Their words are almost accurate and appropriate.</p>
<p>The core of the Pacific issue, that is, the crux of the Pacific issue, is: first, the China issue; second, the immigration issue; and third, the raw materials and market issue. China has 4 million square miles of land, contains unlimited undeveloped resources, and has a population of one-quarter of the world's population, enough to serve as a market for the surplus products of the imperialist powers and as a great resource land for them to take from endlessly. Therefore, the China issue can almost be said to be the most central issue of the Pacific issue. Secondly, in recent times, various countries have suffered greatly from overpopulation. Governments have instead encouraged population growth, and the population has increased even more. Japan has an extremely small land area, and its population is already dense. However, according to the 1930 statistics, its population in the mainland was 64,447,000, and with Korea, Taiwan, and Sakhalin, it totaled 90,400,000, an increase of more than 6,945,000 compared to 1925, an annual increase of about one million people, which makes the problem of overpopulation even more acute. It has no choice but to emigrate abroad. However, looking around the world, the United States has already promulgated immigration laws in the East, and Australia has raised the slogan of "Australia for white people" in the South. Australia is again threatening China and Japan's increased power in the Pacific. Is this something the other powers are willing to accept? Therefore, the immigration issue is another difficult issue that causes disputes in the Pacific. Furthermore, countries such as China, India, Australia, and New Zealand in the Pacific are still stuck in the stage of agricultural economy, with extremely backward industries. The various unexploited raw materials are almost countless. The world's advanced industrial countries are feeling the accumulation of products and the panic of raw materials, and it is inevitable that they will rise up to seize them. Therefore, the issue of raw materials and markets is even more likely to cause disputes in the Pacific. In short, the Mediterranean issue is the past model of the Pacific issue. The first battle that the Mediterranean issue caused is no different from the preview of the world war that is about to be caused by the Pacific issue. The Pacific is about to become the greatest era in ancient and modern times, and it is made by people, not by destiny. Roosevelt's words are just a boast or joke made by the powerful, which is enough to give the weak and small nations of the world infinite terror and threats.</p>
<p>The countries surrounding the Pacific Ocean are numerous and complex. Countries such as Mexico, Peru, Chile, Panama, and Annam are insignificant and do not have a place on the field of Pacific competition. In fact, the only countries with the power to influence the situation on the Pacific Ocean and have the power to compete for hegemony on the Pacific Ocean are Britain, Japan, and the United States. Before the European War, Britain had already established a special force in the Far East. The Yangtze River basin in our country has long been regarded as a sphere of influence, and other countries are not allowed to shake it at all. Moreover, the British imperialists cannot allow other countries to take away the crown of maritime hegemony. It will not relax its competition on the Pacific issue at all. The United States benefited from the European War and is the world's largest wealthy country. The accumulation of capital and goods urgently needs to be exported abroad, and it has no choice but to ask for a share of the vast market in the Far East. Roosevelt once said, "Our future history will be determined by the Pacific Ocean facing China more than by the Atlantic Ocean facing Europe." Its ambition can be seen in general. As for Japan, although its national power has increased sharply due to the European War and it has jumped into the ranks of modern industrial countries, its country is uniquely thin. It feels extremely short of raw materials. The lack of iron and coal is its fatal injury. To save its national lifeline, it will spare no effort to seize raw materials. However, looking around the world, it cannot extend its iron hooves into the United States, nor can it raise its demonic claws to attack Europe. Only China, which has a vast territory and abundant resources on the Pacific Ocean, is the closest and most cowardly and deceitful. Therefore, it decided on a continental policy and actively advanced into the northeast of our country. At the same time, Japan is actually located on the Pacific Ocean. Its national power is strong and its military is sufficient. It will not allow others to encroach on its territory. How can others be allowed to sleep soundly next to the bed? The crown of</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Pacific hegemony will never be handed over to others. With these three countries as the center, and with the complex relationships of other countries in the world pushing and agitating, the Pacific Ocean is undergoing a transformation, with dangerous waves increasing day by day.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Another Money Shortage is About to Occur in Liaoning Province <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The most complicated monetary system in the country is none other than that of Liaoning Province, with silver dollars, national currency notes, Fengtian dollars, Fengtian small dollars, dollar corner notes, decimal copper coins, and so on, a motley array that makes it difficult for newcomers to know how to use them. The most unmanageable thing in Liaoning Province is the Fengtian currency note. Although the history of the Fengtian currency note is very short, the drastic changes over the years are rare in the history of the monetary system. When it was first issued, it was called the one or two Fengtian dollar note, that is, each Fengtian dollar was exchanged for one dollar and two cents of Fengtian small dollars. At that time, the Fengtian dollar note was no different from the silver dollar, and residents used it as the standard for saving money. Some even considered the current dollar and the banknotes issued by the Bank of Communications to be unreliable and specialized in hoarding Fengtian currency notes as foolproof. When Wang Yongjiang was the head of the Department of Finance, he was still able to maintain credit and do his best to maintain it. Later, due to the heavy military use, banknotes were issued, and the Fengtian currency note reserve was very weak, and banknotes were issued endlessly. The market price of Fengtian currency notes gradually declined. However, as of the first half of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the lowest price was still only about 30 Fengtian dollars per silver dollar, and residents who hoarded Fengtian currency notes had already suffered a loss of two-thirds. Merchants used Fengtian currency notes for transactions. To take care of the cost, they had to raise prices as much as possible. The higher the prices, the lower the price of Fengtian currency notes. From the winter of the 17th year to the spring of the 18th year, the price of Fengtian currency notes fell to more than 60 yuan. The market was panicked, and merchants and people cried out in pain. Those who were impoverished and bankrupt were heard of every day, and small vendors and coolies were unable to maintain themselves. Those who were short-sighted and committed suicide were even more countless. The authorities, seeing that the situation was like this, if they did not try their best to maintain it, they were afraid that serious disturbances would occur. On the one hand, the legal price was strictly set, with 50 Fengtian dollars, that is, 60 Fengtian small dollars, worth one silver dollar. The salaries of government employees, merchants' trade, and farmers' taxes were all based on this standard, and no low or high was allowed. On the other hand, the central government was asked to approve the issuance of 18 million yuan of Liaoning Province's financial consolidation public bonds in the 18th year. Since this regulation, the market has begun to calm down. In the past two or three years, bank transactions have been able to maintain the legal price, and the difference is only one or two yuan. However, it can only be low or high in secret and dare not openly break the legal price. Even before the Lunar New Year this year, it was rumored that Fengtian currency notes would fall. The reporter went to various money houses to inquire about the market price of Fengtian currency notes. It was said that whether the price would fall or not could not be predicted, but if there were no special circumstances, it should not fall for no reason. However, recently, Fengtian currency notes suddenly fell sharply. According to the daily market of the Dongsan Province Official Silver Bank, although there were also falls and no rises, it was not drastic. On the 25th, it was 64 yuan and 20 cents, on the 26th, it was 64 yuan and 80 cents, and yesterday (27th) it was 65 yuan and 40 cents. However, the money houses' habit is not to use the market price set by the bank as the transaction standard. In recent days, the market price of money houses has been very different from that of the Official Silver Bank. Yesterday morning, it had fallen to 68 yuan, and in the afternoon, it continued to fall to 72 yuan. At the time of closing the market, it was even heard that it had fallen to 80 yuan. Most money merchants still do not easily sell cash. Today is Sunday, and there is no market as usual. However, the trend is uncertain, and it is difficult to predict whether it can be stabilized tomorrow. This tragic fall of Fengtian currency notes is the second blow since the 17th year. The reason for this is nothing more than the destruction of traitors. However, the citizens are talking about the tiger, and they have been running around to tell each other, as if a great disaster is coming. The sharp fall in three or five days is like a sudden storm, which is also an unprecedented phenomenon in the history of Fengtian currency notes. Now, Chairman Zang of the provincial government has joined the Department of Finance to strictly investigate the traitors who are destroying the market and punish them according to the law. On the one hand, he is quickly planning a stabilization strategy to restore the original state in the shortest possible time. (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e52">The Pinghan Transportation Will Be Restored Soon <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Road Administration Asks the Provincial Government to Strictly Prohibit Villagers from Digging Roads</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: South of Yancheng on the Pinghan Road, the bridge was submerged due to the rise of the Luohe River. At the same time, villagers dug roads to release the flood, and the Pinghan transportation was interrupted for five days. According to the Road Administration, the flood has receded, and all the projects have been rushed to repair by the Engineering Department overnight, and the entire road transportation can be restored on the 5th. All the first and second special express trains on the Pinghan Line will also depart as usual on the morning of the 5th. In addition, the Pinghan Road Management Committee believes that the traffic obstruction this time was caused by the flooding of the bridge, but the villagers digging roads to release the flood was also a major reason. On the 4th, it sent letters to the governments of Hubei, Henan, and Hebei provinces, ordering their subordinates to strictly prohibit it. The letter said, "According to the report of the Engineering Department of this road, a letter from Liu Hongjun, the chief of the second section of this road, to the police section chiefs of Shunyan and Yanhan, stated that now that the summer season has arrived, the rainy season has arrived, and in the past, villagers along the line often dug up road embankments to release water due to flooding, which has a very important impact on traffic. Measures should be taken to prohibit it to avoid damaging traffic. Please check and forward this to the county governments along the road, earnestly advise them, and issue strict prohibitions. This road's main embankment extends 1,414 kilometers. Every summer, when the rain is flooding, the above-mentioned excavation of road embankments to release water occurs from time to time. The section chief's letter to the two police section chiefs requesting that they forward it to the county governments along the road to strictly prohibit it is indeed an essential measure to maintain traffic. It should be submitted to you, asking you to forward it to the governments of Hebei, Henan, and Hubei provinces, and order all counties along the road to strictly prohibit villagers from digging up road embankments to release water in order to maintain traffic. In addition to sending separate letters, we are corresponding to request you to check and order all counties under your jurisdiction to strictly prohibit villagers from digging up road embankments to release water in order to maintain traffic."

<h3 id="e53">Lu Zuo Inspects the Jinpu Railway <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Negotiating Joint Transportation Methods with Various Railways</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Lu Zuo, Chairman of the Jinpu Railway Committee, arrived from Pukou to inspect the railway administration. He arrived in Tianjin at 7:00 AM this morning (3rd). Accompanying Lu were Chen Yongqing, Director of the Transportation Department; Yang Yi, Director of the Mechanical Department; Wu Xizhen, Director of the Engineering Department; Committee Member Qian Zongyuan; and more than ten attendants. All are staying at the National Hotel in the French Concession. At 9:00 AM, Lu visited Gao Jiyi, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau. At 10:00 AM, he went to the office to convene a meeting with staff and gave instructions. At 3:00 PM, he went to the Xigu Factory for inspection and convened a meeting with workers to give instructions. According to his remarks, his mission to the north includes: (1) Increasing the speed of express trains. The special express trains on the Jinpu Railway (Nos. 201 and 202) take 36 hours from Pukou to Tianjin, which is slower than the special express trains on the Jinghu and Beining Railways. The intention is to shorten the travel time for the convenience of passengers. However, the reason for the slow speed of trains on this railway is the years of war, disrepair of roads, damaged sleepers, and numerous bridges destroyed due to military operations. After the pacification of the military, the bridges were hastily repaired for traffic. For the sake of travel safety, the speed was not dared to be increased. Recently, the Engineering Department reported that the bridge repairs were completed at the end of June, so a personal inspection is necessary to ensure safety. However, the decay of sleepers is a major concern for traffic safety. 150,000 sleepers have been purchased for gradual replacement. This afternoon, I briefly discussed shortening the travel time with Gao Jiyi, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau. We will have a more detailed discussion tomorrow. After I return to Beijing, it can be implemented, and the Jinpu line will take about 24-25 hours to restore its old appearance. (2) Implementing joint transportation. After reorganization, this railway now has more than 70 locomotives and more than 900 passenger and freight cars. Although this is not enough to fully supply transportation needs, it is still barely sufficient. However, there are still more than 20 locomotives that need to be repaired at the Pukou factory before they can be used. Recently, eight new locomotives have been ordered from England, which are expected to arrive in Pukou around November of this year. This railway is a major north-south artery, but goods from the Longhai, Jiaoji, and Beining Railways cannot be transferred. This not only increases the cost of handling but also wastes time and labor, which is extremely inconvenient for merchants. This trip north is also a convenient opportunity to discuss joint transportation methods with the Longhai, Jiaoji, and Beining Railways. If this matter can be implemented, not only will the various railways benefit each other, but merchants will also benefit greatly. (3) Eliminating transport companies. This railway has thirty to forty transport companies of various sizes, who control the vehicles and make things difficult for passengers and merchants, preventing merchants from directly requesting cars from the railway bureau to transport goods. They have to beg the transport companies, who then treat the goods as rare commodities. Without paying a considerable price, one cannot obtain a railcar. Outsiders are unaware of this and mistakenly believe that the railway bureau is bribed to sell railcars. This bureau has been unjustly wronged, which is not worthwhile. Therefore, the transport companies will be abolished, effective from the first of this month. In the future, merchants can contact the nearest stationmaster to request cars to transport goods. As long as there are cars, they can be loaded at any time, reducing the suffering of merchants. As for the more than 700,000 yuan in security deposits paid by the transport companies, plus interest, totaling more than 800,000 yuan, due to the dilapidated state of this railway, it has been decided to refund it in three installments. (4) On the 30th of last month, I, along with the directors of various departments, took the 202 train from Pukou north. At 9:00 AM on the 1st, we arrived in Xuzhou, got off the train to inspect, and discussed joint transportation methods with Qian Zongze, Director of the Longhai Railway Bureau. Qian is the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, so there are no problems with this matter. That evening at 8:00 PM, we took the second train north. At 9:00 AM on the 2nd, we arrived in Jinan and immediately discussed joint transportation with representatives of the Jiaoji Railway, which also resulted in a considerable agreement. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, we went to the Jinpu Factory for inspection and convened a meeting with staff to give instructions. At 6:00 PM in the evening, we took the 202 train north again. Tomorrow, we will discuss joint transportation matters in detail with the Beining Railway. After returning to Beijing, we will make a comprehensive plan with various railways, and joint transportation can be implemented. The Bengbu Bridge, Guzhen Bridge, Dawen River Bridge, and Luokou Bridge on this railway, which were damaged by military operations, have all been repaired and are now strong. The organization of the railway union on this railway is not very sound. I think it is necessary to improve it. The Jinpu Railway ferry floating bridge is still actively underway. However, recently, there has been continuous summer rain in the south, and the river has risen sharply, slightly halting the bridge construction on the riverbank. It is expected that it will be fully completed in March or April next year. After the completion of this bridge, not only will travel be convenient, but goods from the north and south can directly reach their destinations, eliminating the hassle of loading and unloading on both sides of the Yangtze River. This railway is currently in a slow season, with monthly revenue of about one million yuan and annual revenue of about twenty million yuan. With continued efforts in reorganization, increasing locomotives, and adjusting transportation capacity, it is expected that annual revenue can reach thirty million yuan. (July 3)</p>
<h3 id="e54">The Remaining Bandits in Pingjiang, Hunan Province, Will Soon Be Eliminated <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Wang Dongyuan Encourages Those Who Were Coerced to Renounce Banditry</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The red bandits in Pingjiang, Hunan Province, have been suppressed repeatedly under the supervision of Wang Dongyuan of the 15th Division. The bandits have fled to the Jiangxi border in droves, and the villages are gradually becoming stable. Unexpectedly, on the 12th of this month, several thousand remnants of Kong Hechong's troops fled to the area. They were met head-on by Wang's troops, who killed one fake division commander and two fake regimental commanders, and captured many guns and bandits. The bandits died in droves in the fields. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented in the county's bandit suppression efforts. The bandits suffered a major blow this time, and their strength has been extinguished. The remnants are still fleeing to the Jiangxi border and are currently being cleared step by step. They will be completely eliminated in a few days. However, the bandits have been entrenched in this county for the longest time, and the people have been deeply banditized. Commander Wang now believes that since the core bandits have been pacified, those who were coerced can be forgiven. After repeated announcements, they are allowed to renounce banditry. Now, during the step-by-step suppression, a proclamation is re-issued, urging them to renounce banditry and surrender to avoid perishing with the bandits. The proclamation is as follows: This division has been ordered to station in Pingjiang to suppress bandits for half a year. At first, because the order was newly established, the people were under the coercion of the Communist bandits, and many were forced to join the bandits. Therefore, we treated them with leniency and did not investigate those who were coerced, allowing them to renounce banditry and opening a path to life. We have repeatedly issued orders and earnestly advised them, which should be known to all fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, aunts, and sisters in Pingjiang. On the 12th of this month, the bandit Kong Hechong reassembled a large number of bandits to attack our division's village defense, attempting a final struggle. Our Li Regiment fiercely attacked them, killing more than a thousand bandits, seizing hundreds of guns, and scattering them in all directions, collapsing into disarray. In total, in the battles of Longmen, Pingjiang, Shicun, and others, the Kong bandits were repeatedly defeated, and their strength disintegrated, making them unable to withstand a single blow, which can be seen in general. This division is currently joining forces with Chen's Division in Liuyang and Tan's Division in Xiutong to encircle and suppress the Kong bandits, which is imminent. At this opportunity, you, the people, should intensify your efforts to help our army, scout out bandit information, search for bandit dens, and cooperate between the army and the people to quickly achieve the effect of clearing the entire territory. If there are still those who are obstinate or have lingering intentions, they must lead their sons, supervise their brothers, and urge them to renounce banditry or tie them up and send them here, which will be dealt with leniently, so as not to perish with the bandits, causing grief to your parents and brothers. This division commander, in the past, was concerned about those who were coerced and had the suffering of being forced to join the bandits, and did not hesitate to speak earnestly, repeatedly urging them to renounce banditry and return to goodness, truly embodying the virtue of heaven and earth's love for life, and not just being able to kill. Now, because the time has been long, it is not appropriate to be overly concerned, so that the chief villains have been subjected to public execution for a long time. Therefore, this proclamation is made in good faith. After this announcement, if there are still riots, disturbances, or work for the bandits in Pingjiang, it is truly self-generated and willing to become bandits. We will resolutely use the principle of killing to stop killing, adopt the final means, carry out a bloodbath, and leave no grass behind. Do not say that you were not warned. Let everyone be vigilant, be careful with this proclamation.</p>
<h3 id="e55">The Progress of Disaster Relief in Hunan Province <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The Relief Association Sends Letters to All Sectors in Shanghai and Hankou for Assistance</p>
<p>And Asks the Changjun Guild Hall to Quickly Remit the Previously Raised Relief Funds</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The Hunan Disaster Relief Association believes that the flood in Hunan Province this time is extremely severe, unprecedented in recent decades. Although it has been decided to issue Hunan disaster relief public bonds of three million yuan to provide relief, due to the importance of the matter, it cannot be completed in a short time, and the starving are waiting for relief, which cannot be delayed. The association has also established a Hunan Disaster Relief Association and a Fundraising Committee in Hankou to raise large sums of money in the prosperous commercial ports of Shanghai and Hankou to provide emergency relief. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the association's affairs, it has sent letters to all sectors for assistance. At the same time, it has sent a letter to the Changjun Guild Hall in Hankou, asking it to quickly remit the funds raised previously to Hunan to save the dying. The letters are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Letter to Various Groups in Shanghai and Hankou: Respectfully, Hunan has suffered from years of war and has not yet recovered. The red flames are rampant and still fierce. Recently, the counties along the Xiang River have been flooded. In the counties along the river, mountain torrents have erupted, turning houses into ruins and fields into nothing. Livestock, grain, food, silver, and money have all been swept away by the floods. The disaster in dozens of counties is unprecedented in recent decades and is rare in more than twenty provinces. Seeing this strange disaster, the members of our association are deeply worried. We have organized the Hunan Disaster Relief Association, which was established on the 8th of this month. It has been submitted to the Hunan Provincial Party Affairs Guidance Committee and the Hunan Provincial Government for filing. At the same time, we have submitted a request to the provincial government to issue disaster relief public bonds of three million yuan, with the remaining profits from the Shuikoushan as collateral, which has also been approved. However, disaster relief is urgent and requires immediate action. The fundraising method cannot be limited to established practices. In addition to the government members setting up a Disaster Relief Bond Raising Bureau in Hankou to solicit merchants to find ways to promote sales, the starving are waiting for relief, which cannot be delayed. Our association has also publicly recommended Luo Junduo and Shu Junlijian to set up a Hunan Disaster Relief Association and a Fundraising Committee in Hankou to raise large sums of money in the prosperous commercial ports of Shanghai and Hankou to provide emergency relief. We have always believed that your association is kind, eager to help others, and concerned about the disaster in Hunan. We hope that you will give us your strong support to save the lives of more disaster victims and create more happiness for the people of Hunan. Not only will the members of the open association be grateful, but also we will look forward to your reply. We wish you well.</p>
<p>Letter to the Changjun Guild Hall in Hankou: Respectfully, the disaster in Hunan is tragic, unprecedented, and unimaginable. The newspapers have revealed it, and the public has spread the news. We believe that all gentlemen are concerned about their hometowns and have a clear understanding of the situation. However, the red flames in Hunan are still rampant. Chaling and Anren have just been recovered, but then the county was lost again. The suffering in the depths of water and fire is unbearable. Now, after this great flood, the survivors have no way to survive, the dead have no time to be buried, and they are displaced and exposed, which is truly unbearable to describe. It is found that the flood in Hunan Province in 1926 was also severe. The gentlemen of the overseas compatriots in Hankou raised more than 10,000 yuan in relief funds, which were stored for allocation. Later, it was suspended due to an incident and has not been remitted to Hunan. We believe that it is still preserved and has not been moved. This year's disaster in Hunan is a hundred times more severe than that of 1926. Our colleagues have no hesitation in organizing the Hunan Disaster Relief Association and want to do our best to raise relief funds. Now, we are pleading for the lives of hundreds of thousands of disaster victims. We hope that you will give us your strong support and quickly remit the funds raised previously to Hunan to save the lives of these dying people. We are extremely hopeful. Our association has publicly recommended Luo Junduo, the director of the investigation department, and Shu Lijian, the director of the design department, to come to Hankou to listen to your instructions in person. We hope that you will give us instructions on everything. We are extremely grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e56">The Torrential Rains in the Three Rivers of Guangdong Province <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The Guangzhou-Shaoguan Train Stopped Due to a Landslide</p>
<p>The Banks of the Three Rivers Have All Become Swamps</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The torrential rains in the East, West, and North Rivers of Guangdong Province have suddenly risen at the same time. Since June 28, the floods have spread to both banks of the Pearl River. The streets near the embankments in Guangzhou City that have not closed the roads have all been flooded, with a depth of about one foot. The low-lying inner streets in the Xiguan area have also become swamps. The river water in the provincial river has turned into a bloody red, and the water is turbulent, making it extremely dangerous to travel by boat. According to yesterday's report on the river water, there has been continuous rain in the North River, and mountain torrents have suddenly arrived. On the 28th, the area near the military field station to Yuantan station on the Yue-Shao Railway was flooded by mountain torrents, and the villagers rushed to escape. At the Lidong station near Yingde, a barren mountain with loose soil was eroded by rainwater and collapsed more than half on the morning of the 28th. The mud and stones crushed about three feet of the track at Lidong station, and all the utility poles and wires were destroyed. It was also reported that from midnight to 3:00 AM this morning, the loess mountain, also known as the Bolo Gang, near the Bopotang on the Guangzhou-Shaoguan Railway was hit by mountain rain and suddenly collapsed, covering the track with mud and soil, covering an area of about one or two acres. More than ten feet of the track sleepers from the Pa River estuary to the Bopotang station were destroyed. When the station staff heard the alarm, they urgently telegraphed Shaoguan to stop the southbound passenger and freight trains and simultaneously telegraphed the Huangsha main station to stop the northbound trains. Therefore, the second passenger and freight train from Guangzhou to Shaocheng on that day returned after reaching the Pa River estuary and did not arrive until after midnight. On the 29th, the tracks at each station above Yuantan were still submerged by the floodwater, and the train could not run. To this day, the direct express train from Guangzhou to Shaoguan has been suspended for three days. Areas from Yuantan to the Pa River estuary, Hengshi, and other places have become swamps, and the villagers nearby have been displaced. Several sections of the embankments around the Pa River have collapsed, and countless houses have collapsed, and countless people and livestock have drowned. Moreover, the Pa River flows directly to Qingyuan County, so the county's floods are even more severe. It is estimated that there have been reports of embankment collapses every day since the 25th. The Rongshu Village embankment in the county, which is the largest embankment, also collapsed on the 26th, and all the residents of the village drowned. The highway from Qingyuan to Yinzhan'ao was also washed away by the water. The county has sent a representative to the province to request relief. As for the floodwater in the West River, according to a returning guest from Wuzhou, the streets of Wuzhou on the 28th were about two feet deep, and boats could travel on land. Because Zhaoqing has a gorge, the water is particularly turbulent, and the overturning of boats is heard every day. The floodwater in Yuecheng has risen by more than ten feet, especially at the Lianjiang River estuary. The height of the floodwater can be level with the door lintels of the shops. Residents built floating bridges to come and go and moved to the foothills to live temporarily at night. The southwest of Sanshui is the confluence of the Northwest and West Rivers. Currently, the streets in the southwest are knee-deep in water, and residents use small boats as a means of transportation. Most of the goods are moved to the embankments for trade. The inner streets of Foshan are shin-deep in water. Since the 29th, merchants and residents have built floating bridges to come and go. As for the East River, there has been heavy rain every day since the beginning of summer. The water level of the river has risen to eight feet, and the rice fields along the river have become a vast expanse of water. The early rice crops have already been lost. (July 1)</p>

After the case occurred, the county government requested the Jinpu Railway Garrison Headquarters to issue a temporary martial law order. Commander Wang believed that the county government's measures for this case were inappropriate, and the issuance of martial law was not a military situation and was not approved. He instructed the county government to consider the public opinion and formulate a fair handling method and submit it to the competent authority for approval. He also ordered the military police inspection office to send more troops to patrol and pay attention to suppression at any time, peacefully stopping the matter, so as to avoid causing more incidents.

<h3 id="e58">The Executive Yuan Did Not Approve the Establishment of Yantai as a City <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Executive Yuan previously believed that Yantai's population was less than 200,000 and did not have the qualifications to be established as a city. It ordered the cancellation of the Yantai Municipal Government and merged it into Fushan County. Subsequently, Liu Zhennian, a member of the Shandong Provincial Government and commander of the 21st Division, sent a letter to the provincial government, stating that Yantai was a place where Chinese and foreigners lived together, and there were many foreign affairs. It was inconvenient to handle matters without a municipal government. It was proposed to organize a small-scale municipal government and asked for a resolution. The provincial government meeting discussed the case and submitted it to the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Finance for review and sent it to the Executive Yuan for instructions, along with two alternative methods: (1) Establish a small-scale municipal government. (2) Expand the foreign affairs section of Fushan County. After the submission, the Executive Yuan submitted the case to the Ministry of the Interior for review, which still believed that Yantai was not suitable for establishment as a city. There were three reasons: (1) The population was less than 200,000. (2) Yantai was very close to Fushan County, which was not inconvenient in any way. (3) Yantai had not handled the licensing tax, etc. The Executive Yuan replied to Lu the day before yesterday. Today (3rd), the provincial government meeting raised it for discussion again and decided to inform Liu Zhennian of the Executive Yuan's reply. The issue of Yantai's establishment as a city has come to a temporary end. (3rd)</p>

<p>Three Bandits to be Sent to the Command Headquarters for Interrogation: The Sixth Company of the Provincial Security Team stationed in Ping, Changshu County, apprehended three bandits, Wang Fengyi, Chen Changwan, and Lu Rujin, in Hu on the 28th of last month. They were sent to the battalion headquarters, where Battalion Commander Shen interrogated them. Chen Changwan confessed to being a bandit and committing crimes in Hu and Shanghai, colluding with Lu Rujin and others in robberies, and acknowledging Wang Fengyi as their boss. Wang Fengyi, however, gave evasive statements, denying being a bandit. Lu Rujin even claimed to be a detective in the First Squad of the Thirteenth Team of the Water Police, and was bailed out by Yang Qingjiu, the captain of the Thirteenth Team. Subsequently, the Hu Pu North Goods Association and others deemed Captain Yang's action inappropriate and filed a complaint with the provincial government and the Security Bureau. Recently, Battalion Commander Shen Yiming went to inspect the Fuliang Bridge in Taicang, and incidentally learned that Wang Fengyi had committed crimes in Changshu during the Republic of China Year 15, and had fled to Taicang, colluding with ruffians and engaging in kidnapping. He was wanted by the defense corps and escaped. His son was captured and is still in jail. After Battalion Commander Shen completed a detailed investigation, he returned to Changshu. He has now decided to bring back Lu Rujin, who was bailed out by the Thirteenth Team, from Yang Qingjiu, and to re-interrogate him along with the temporarily detained Wang and Chen, before sending them to the Jiangyin Command Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>Another Large-Scale Transfer of Police Officers: Since Yin Peng came to Changshu to take over as the director of the County Public Security Bureau, there have been numerous changes in the police officers and staff of the various branch offices. Now, Director Yin has reviewed the performance of the heads of the various branch offices and has made further changes. Cheng Bin, a police officer from the General Bureau, has been transferred to serve as a police officer in the First Branch Office. Zhang Xun from the Sixth Branch Office in Hupu has been appointed as a police officer in the General Bureau. Luo Qifan, the original police officer of the First Branch Office, has been transferred to serve as a police officer in the Ninth Branch Office in Dongzhang City. Wang Rongxuan, the original police officer, has been transferred to serve as a police officer in the Fourth Branch Office. Zhou Jiexi, the original police officer of the Fourth Branch Office, has been promoted to head of the Third Branch Office in Liantang. Xu Maoting, the original head of the Third Branch Office, has been demoted to police officer in the Sixth Branch Office in Hupu. Hu Tianpu, the head of the Third Branch Office in Liantang, has been demoted to clerk. Zhang Yongkang, a clerk from the General Bureau, has been appointed to fill the vacancy. The postal clerk of the General Bureau is concurrently held by Police Officer Zhang Xun.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Disposes of Bandit Boats: The County Detective Team previously seized many bandit boats while cracking down on bandits in Liantang and other places. These boats are still docked in the city river behind the county government. Attempts to auction them off have been unsuccessful. Now, the Public Security Bureau, in handling summer sanitation, has hired many cleaners to remove garbage. However, with the large amount of garbage to be transported, more boats are needed. In view of the fact that the abandoned bandit boats cannot be sold, it is proposed to allocate three of them for transporting garbage. This has been approved by the Public Security Bureau's sanitation meeting and is now being submitted to the county government for approval.</p>

<p>County Relief Institute Petitions for Subsidy: Yang Shoumei and Qin Ren Cun, the president and vice-president of the County Relief Institute, stated that according to a letter from Hua Wenchuan, the director of the institute's medical clinic, the clinic's funding is insufficient. The income and expenses of all the Hengshan assets are not enough to cover the costs. According to the resolution of the joint meeting, the allowance for the original 400 impoverished people must still be issued monthly and maintained as usual. However, the proposed budget expenditure of the medical clinic has no source of funding and requests to find ways to raise funds or ask the County Treasury to allocate funds to carry out the project. As for the election of Wenchuan as the director of the medical clinic, he believes he is unqualified and unable to take on the responsibility, and hopes to be removed by the county and appoint a virtuous and capable person, etc. After approving the letter, President Yang stated that the Hengshan assets were originally not much, and in the late Qing Dynasty, most of them relied on donations from the business community. In recent years, these donations have completely stopped, making it difficult to maintain the allowances for the 400 impoverished people, and now they are also undertaking medical work, and the expenditure has no source of funding, which is indeed the actual situation. However, since they have already undertaken to handle it, they cannot stop it due to lack of funding. In addition to instructing them to reduce the budget expenditure and merge the staff, they specially submitted a report to the county government yesterday, requesting to find ways to subsidize them so that they can work hard to carry out the project. As for Director Hua's resignation, a letter has been sent to earnestly retain him.</p>
<p>Recruiting Crew Members for Chartered Steamships, Crew Members Desert: The Transportation Department of the Nanjing Headquarters previously received a telegram from the Nanchang Commander-in-Chief's Office, requiring ten shallow-draft steamships to be chartered immediately. The department, upon receiving the order, dispatched commissioners Hua Shousong and others to Wuxi to contact the County Chamber of Commerce and the Shipping Association. Ten steamships, including Youdao, Shengli, and Wanli, were chartered and set sail for Nanjing on the first of this month. However, most of the crew members deserted en route, leaving the ships without drivers. The Transportation Department of the Headquarters, urgently needing the steamships due to repeated telegrams from the Nanchang Commander-in-Chief's Office, telegraphed the County Chamber of Commerce the day before yesterday, requesting that they be responsible for equipping the ships with personnel, earnestly inform them, and order them to quickly return to their original ships to serve, or to supplement them as appropriate, to ensure that the ships' drivers and managers are fully equipped. After receiving the telegram, the County Chamber of Commerce repeatedly stated that the Wuxi steamships have a very shallow draft and are yacht-like in nature, making them difficult to withstand wind and waves. The machinery has been damaged and cannot be started. Yesterday, they specially telegraphed the Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, requesting that the Transportation Department be ordered to return them. At the same time, the County Chamber of Commerce also stated that recently, there have been bad elements in the outside world, falsely sealing ships and swindling, which is indeed hateful. They also sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, requesting that they be strictly prohibited to reassure the people and facilitate navigation.</p>

<p>Factory Owner Steals City Bricks: He San (aka He Bingsheng), the owner of the Heyuanji carpentry shop in Shuangjing Lane in the city, has accumulated a huge amount of wealth in recent years due to the relocation of the provincial government to Zhenjiang and repeated contracting of construction work on various agency buildings, often using means of cutting corners. Last year, he leased the land and buildings of the Hongqikou Banner People's Livelihood Office and planned to raise shares to open a Hongxing bathhouse. There have been repeated disputes. Later, the Bank of China established a branch and obtained a mortgage of 2,000 yuan to construct the brick wall, which contained a large number of city bricks. The Construction Engineering Office found out that He had never purchased city bricks and was suspected of theft. He was summoned for interrogation, but he was afraid to appear in court and asked someone to intercede. The office inquired in detail where the bricks came from, but He could not answer. Director Ye was very angry and immediately sent someone to summon He for severe punishment by the court. Hearing this, He fled and hid in the countryside temporarily. After someone spoke on his behalf, the office proposed a minimum penalty of 4,000 yuan to be confiscated and ordered that the stolen city bricks be returned. The matter is still under mediation.</p>

<p>Regarding the Sino-American extraterritoriality negotiations, after Dr. Wu Chaoshu, our country's ambassador to the United States, resigned, the case has already been contacted by the US ambassador to China, Johnson, and Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, who decided to move the handling to China. However, the US ambassador is not very familiar with the content of the negotiations between the two parties in the United States and the extent to which they have reached, so he must wait for the US government to send all the negotiation documents to China before continuing. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound Society interviewed a certain important American official. According to him, the US government has already prepared all the negotiation documents, sealed them, and sent them to China. The package includes many things such as the exchange of notes and negotiation records between Ambassador Wu and the US diplomatic authorities, as well as the US side's opinions. It has already been sealed and sent to Shanghai. The US ambassador is expected to receive it around the end of this month or the beginning of next month. Once Mr. Johnson receives these documents, learns the details, and reads them in detail, he can go south to meet with Foreign Minister Wang and continue the negotiations.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Recommends Promoting Woolen Factory <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Document presented to the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce presented a document to the Ministry of Industry yesterday, saying, "Presenting for the purpose of presenting matters. The association held a general meeting of members on June 27. According to the proposal put forward by the Woolen Industry Association, our country has a vast land and abundant resources, with a population of 470 million. Production is declining, and we rely on foreigners for everything. What a shame. As far as the most important woolen goods are concerned, such as Zhigong woolen cloth, overcoat woolen cloth, and Huate woolen cloth, etc., today they have become essential items for the lives of our people. Almost all ordinary social clothes, hats, and shoes are made of woolen cloth. The annual imports are about 50 million taels of silver. For decades, we have not heard of any measures to set up factories to resist them. In recent years, although there are camel wool factories and one or two woolen factories with equipment, they are far from comparable to foreign factories. Moreover, the output is not much, and what they supply is less than one or two percent of what is needed. It is almost like using a cup of water to save a cart of firewood. Woolen cloth was invented in England. The raw material, wool, is mostly produced in Australia and Siberia. Occasionally, there is a small amount of research. Therefore, the output is inferior to that of Australia and West Asia. Otherwise, it is also a very good production in our country. According to the area where sheep are produced in Australia and West Asia and the place where woolen cloth is woven in England, the people who rely on it for their livelihoods are unknown. There is a place in England called Yorkshire, which is a concentrated area of woolen factories. The products, in addition to those used in the country, are all resold abroad by the export shops in Bradford.</p>
<p>Therefore, the people in these two places all live on woolen cloth, and few engage in other industries. Later, France invented a kind of plain serge, made of second-grade wool mixed with waste materials, which was cheaper than English cloth. Initially, there were only two or three small factories, but because it was widely sold in our country, it took the place of English cloth. (French plain serge, when imported into our country the most, amounted to more than 3,000 boxes per year.) Until today, its large and small serge factories have increased to dozens, and the sudden increase in productivity and the employment of workers all come from the gift of our Chinese people. Recently, Japan saw that French serge was selling well, so it also spun this type of serge. Every year, 800 to 1,000 boxes are imported into our country, but the output of French goods has not been affected in the slightest. In addition, there are also fancy woolen cloth, flat and thick woolen cloth, felt woolen cloth, etc., from Germany, Italy, and other countries, which are also a large number. This can prove that woolen cloth has become an essential item for the lives of our people in our country. Recently, the British, because serge has been taken away by France and Japan, spent more than 13,000 pounds (it is said that the Manchester Chamber of Commerce bears 30%, the local chambers of commerce 20%, and the government 50%) to send an economic survey team to China. Although the surface is to investigate cotton cloth, in fact, woolen cloth is also valued. The purpose is nothing more than to recover the old position. After returning to the country, they have united various woolen factories to form a large unity. The government is behind them, hoping to compete with France and Japan. All of these want to take our country as their market. They exhaust their efforts, absorb money, and design, using all means to the extreme. Therefore, members are frightened and want to save the situation. They must have sufficient equipment. They must know that saving the country through industry and relying on people's livelihoods cannot but be followed up urgently. The members sit idly by and watch tens of millions of dollars overflow every year. Every time they think of it, they want to organize a factory with a slightly larger scale, but because the required capital is too large, they cannot do it. Therefore, they will buy and sell its advantages and disadvantages at the general meeting in order to enable patriotic people to work together to carry out the project. How to take on its fixed capital and how the national power can be supplemented, and also ask to transfer it to the national government, and plan the day and night. The members rely on woolen cloth for their business, and they will not dare to fall behind in promoting domestic woolen cloth. If the government adopts it and orders the organization, the members are willing to work hard to promote it. The matter concerns the national economy and people's livelihood, and they propose that the association make a public decision and transfer it to the national government for adoption and implementation. The second article of the General's Outline for Founding the Country states that the government should seek the development of weaving with the people in order to enrich the people's clothing. Woolen fabrics are necessary for clothing. The existing factories have not prepared their products, and the number is limited. They are not enough to meet the needs of the people. In the past, the Gansu Weaving Factory and the Shanghai Weaving Bureau had precedents of raising funds from public companies. At a time when commercial capabilities are still in their infancy, the teachings of the General are followed from afar, and the success of various countries is taken as a model. Without the full cooperation of the government, it is impossible to develop domestic woolen fabrics and recover the overflow of profits. Based on the above reasons, the association members decided at the general meeting of members on June 27 to submit it to your ministry for adoption and implementation. The reason is to record the case and prepare a document for presentation. May your ministry examine it and approve its implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Strictly Prohibit Raising Prices After Cutting Customs Duty <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Letter to Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent letters to various trade associations, saying, "Following the order of the Social Bureau and the Ministry of Industry, the Central Secretariat Office issued a letter stating that the Central Secretariat Office, under the direction of Jiang, the concurrent director, received a letter from the Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters requesting strict prohibition of merchants from raising prices after cutting customs duty. The order was handed over to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, etc. for reasons. The Central Government has clearly ordered the cutting of customs duty in order to consider the people's livelihood. Prices in various places should be low, which is enough to support the government's intention to cut customs duty. If merchants take the opportunity to raise prices, it is inappropriate. You should understand the local situation, strictly prohibit it, and report the handling situation at any time for verification." Therefore, a letter is hereby issued to inform you, please take note.</p>
<h3 id="e78">The Social Affairs Bureau Restricts Private Contracts Between Labor and Management <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Agreements that conflict with group agreements are invalid.</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau announced yesterday that, in accordance with Article 16 of the Group Agreement Law, it is necessary to restrict labor contracts between employers and workers that differ from group agreements, because workers are ignorant and easily controlled, which is also the government's intention to protect labor. Now that the law has not yet been implemented, private contracts between labor and management in this city that differ from group agreements are not uncommon. Therefore, it is announced that the content of labor contracts between employers and workers that differ from the labor conditions stipulated in the group agreement are invalid. The invalid parts are replaced by the provisions of the group agreement. However, agreements that differ from the group agreement are valid if they are permitted by the group agreement or change labor conditions for the benefit of the workers and the group agreement does not expressly prohibit them. In addition, for group agreements with no time limit, the minimum time limit is set to one year. Even if it exceeds one</p>
<p>year and there is no new agreement, the labor contract should still be bound by it. All parties of labor and management in this city should abide by it.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Legal Mandate</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of making a request, the association held a members' general meeting on June 27th. According to the proposal submitted by the Cotton Fabric Trade Association, chambers of commerce in our country are, according to legal regulations, based on industrial and commercial trade associations as their fundamental organization, and industrial and commercial trade associations are based on individual businesses within the same industry as their fundamental organization. However, the legal provisions regarding participation in groups are all discretionary, leading to a wait-and-see attitude and hesitation. With members scattered and unorganized, a sound structure is difficult to achieve. With command not unified, how can strength be concentrated? It is difficult to effectively utilize commercial organizations to promote industrial and commercial development. Therefore, to correct these problems and solidify the foundation, it is proposed that this association request the government to make mandatory regulations in the law as a fundamental remedy," and "According to the proposal submitted by the Fruit and Produce Trade Association, the organization of trade associations is originally intended to promote overall unity, enhance public interests, and correct abuses. Therefore, all members of the same trade, regardless of affiliation, should respect the law, join the association, and work together for common well-being. Without mandatory membership measures, those who have already joined bear all the obligations, such as raising funds for national and municipal bonds, providing disaster relief, and other obligations stipulated by law, while those who have not joined can remain uninvolved. As for the benefits and protections that the law should provide, there is no distinction between those who have joined and those who have not. Those who have joined feel bound by the law, association regulations, and resolutions, while those who have not joined have no such restrictions. Relatively speaking, those who have joined often find it more convenient to withdraw, and trade associations are on the verge of collapse. It is hoped that the general meeting will resolve to request the government to clearly stipulate that all members of the same trade should uniformly join the trade association to ensure unity," etc. It is noted that in recent years, the government has entrusted various associations with the responsibility of raising funds for the issuance of government bonds and treasury bills, but the authority of each association only extends to its members, making it difficult to handle affairs. This is especially true of voluntary membership, which greatly hinders the exercise of the association's powers. Other abuses have been detailed by the two associations and need not be repeated. Moreover, if the number of businesses in the same trade exceeds seven, they may not join the chamber of commerce as store members, as stipulated in Article 10 of the Implementing Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law. The current law clearly stipulates that trade associations are compulsory organizations, not based on a laissez-faire approach. However, associations rely on their members for their existence. If associations are forcibly organized, but membership remains voluntary, the association will inevitably become a mere formality, which is inconsistent with the fundamental purpose of compulsory organization and seems contradictory. Based on the above reasons, it was resolved at the general meeting of the affiliated association on June 27th to request your ministry to supplement the Implementing Rules of the Trade Association Law with a provision requiring all members of the same trade to join the association. It is appropriate to record this case and submit a document for your review and action."</p>
<h3 id="e80">Guo Jingluan Reports on the Discovery of Martyr Cai's Remains <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Guo Jingluan, the widow of Cai Gongshi, hosted the local press at Gongshi Middle School at 5 p.m. yesterday. More than twenty people attended. The following is Guo's report on the discovery of the remains of Martyr Cai Gongshi:</p>
<p>(1) Motivation for Investigating the Remains: After the martyrdom of Cai and others, Jingluan, after completing the funeral arrangements, immediately requested the government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to allow her to go to Jinan to investigate and retrieve the remains. At that time, Mr. Tan Yankai told her that the remains of the martyrs were said to be in the backyard of the Diplomatic Affairs Office and that they would have to wait until the Jinan Incident was resolved before they could be recovered. Mr. Wang Zhengting also advised her to wait a while and comforted her. Jingluan, grieving for the deceased and wanting to establish a permanent memorial, decided to found Gongshi School. With the support of party and state veterans, she went overseas to raise funds. After returning to China last year, she was eager to open the school, and the Jinan Incident remained unresolved, so the matter was temporarily suspended. In January of this year, the Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters exposed the unscrupulous merchant Zhang Shuheng for privately renting the old Diplomatic Affairs Office to the Japanese, and requested the Shandong government to recover the land. Jingluan believed that since the remains of the martyrs were buried in the</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>backyard of the Office, and the Japanese had taken the house under an alias, it was clear that they were plotting to obliterate the traces of the May Third Massacre. Therefore, she immediately submitted a request to the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, asking them to order the Shandong Provincial Government to recover the land, severely punish the unscrupulous merchant, and request to personally investigate. However, due to illness and the demands of school affairs, it was delayed until February before she was able to travel to Jinan.</p>
<p>(2) Overview of the Two Trips to Jinan: Upon arriving in Jinan, Jingluan visited various party and government agencies and received strong support from Chairman Han, Mr. He Siyuan, and various party, government, and public organizations. As a result, a preparatory committee for commemorating the May Third Martyrs was formed. Its main measures were: (1) establishing a martyrs' tomb at the old Diplomatic Affairs Office, (2) converting the house into a martyrs' shrine, (3) casting a bronze statue of Cai, and (4) founding the May Third School. Proper arrangements were also made for investigating and retrieving the remains, and preparations were made for excavation. At this time, Jingluan received telegrams from Beijing and Shanghai reporting that overseas donors who had contributed to the construction of the school building had sent representatives back to China to inspect the school site and needed to meet with Jingluan. Reluctantly, she had to return. After returning, she fell ill and was busy with the school's affairs. After the May Third Commemoration Meeting, she went to Jinan again. In addition to resolving to do her best to recover the house where the martyrs died and establish the bronze statue of the martyrs, the martyrs' shrine, and the May Third School, she also began excavating the remains. After arriving in Jinan and making contact, she rushed to Beiping to inquire about the situation of the Republic University, which was originally founded by Cai. Party and government agencies in Beiping held a public memorial service for Cai at Zhongshan Park in Beiping. At the same time, the conference telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to quickly resolve the May Third Massacre. Jingluan was anxious to excavate the remains of the martyrs and hurriedly returned to Jinan on June 21st.</p>
<p>(3) The Reality of the Excavation: After arriving in Jinan, she convened the fifth meeting of the preparatory committee for commemorating the May Third Martyrs on the 23rd and resolved to excavate on the 24th. On that day, Jingluan, along with the relatives of the martyrs Han Chun, Sun Wuxue, Rong and Cai's guards Shen Changsheng and other workers, went to the backyard of the old Diplomatic Affairs Office. The excavation site was in the southwest corner of the garden, which was originally a place where workers took soil. After digging more than two feet, only the mat and rope used to wrap the bodies on the day of the martyrdom were found, all of which had rotted, and no bones were found. Further down was hard soil, which was deeply disappointing. However, Jingluan was not reconciled and ordered the workers to search and dig nearby, but nothing was found. On the 25th, they continued to excavate in the southwest corner of the garden. All the loose soil in the backyard was dug up, and Japanese water bottles, military knives, stirrups, and belts were found in the middle of the ground, along with more than a dozen military uniforms. Although no bones were found, Jingluan reasoned that the bones must also be in the backyard and ordered the workers to continue searching. Until 5 p.m., the excavation was carried out in the southwest corner of the garden, about ten feet from the south wall and about fifteen feet from the west wall. Only five inches into the ground, the burnt bones of the martyrs, cremated by the Japanese, were found. All that was seen was bone ash, skulls, limb bones, pelvic bones, rib bones, finger bones, and the remains of burnt military Shandong maps, shoe soles, clothes, belts, etc. The scene was heartbreaking and unbearable. She could only cry loudly to vent her grief. Then she used paper bags to collect them one by one and placed them in ceramic basins. She immediately reported to reporters from various newspapers at the Diplomatic Affairs Office and notified the preparatory committee for commemorating the May Third Martyrs. She visited Chairman Han and Mr. He Siyuan, and telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Jingluan's personal name. On the 26th, she continued to excavate and collect, and the Shandong government still had no appropriate measures to take. The preparatory committee for commemorating the May Third Martyrs advocated putting them in ceramic urns and burying them temporarily. Jingluan believed that this was inappropriate and feared accidents. Jingluan personally visited the chairman, who had approved bringing them back. She decided to collect the ashes in a box and carry them to Beijing, departing from Pupu south in the morning of the 27th.</p>
<p>(4) Japanese Consul Nishida's Shock: Nishida, the Japanese consul stationed in Jinan, had been paying close attention to Jingluan's trip to Jinan, the investigation of the remains, and the resolutions after the establishment of the preparatory committee for commemorating the May Third Massacre. This time, Jingluan finally discovered the ashes of the martyrs who had been cremated by the Japanese in an attempt to obliterate the traces of the massacre. The Japanese in Jinan were very panicked, and Nishida was even more shocked. He had sent a detailed telegram to the Japanese government to report. However, Jingluan believed that the Japanese brutally murdered diplomatic officials and opened an unprecedented international precedent, causing the May Third Massacre. This hatred and shame will never be forgotten by the Chinese people. For the rest of their lives, they vow to avenge it. Even any country or people in the world who uphold humanity and justice have recognized their barbarous hearts. No matter how cleverly the Japanese try to conceal it with deceitful propaganda, how can they easily cover up the facts? Although these bones were cremated, they were finally discovered. Our people have a greater understanding of their brutal face and insidious methods, and it is enough to prove that the Japanese are indeed a ironclad proof of harming our country's diplomatic officials in our country's diplomatic missions. In future negotiations on the Jinan Incident, this will naturally be the prerequisite. At the same time, I hope that countries that uphold humanitarianism and justice will also give our country sympathetic assistance, so that in the future, the world's international relations will not be caused by this inhuman Japanese who create the evil precedent of harming diplomatic officials. Therefore, our people believe that the Japanese Consul Nishida's shock and report this time shows that the Japanese are trying to cover up their crimes, which is futile and will only cause deeper resentment at recent wounds.</p>
<p>(5) Request for the Arrangement of the Remains: Jingluan originally intended to send the remains to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review. When she arrived in Beijing, she was exhausted from crying too much. The Foreign Minister Wang had already arrived in Shanghai, and the next day was Monday's memorial week, so she did not meet with the authorities and did not draft a written report. Therefore, she returned to the bureau to rest. Now, in addition to telegraphing Chairman Chiang to ask for instructions, she has also submitted requests to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including: 1. Appealing to the National Government to mourn the martyrs' sacrifice for the country and order a state funeral. 2. Appealing to the National Government to send personnel to receive the remains of the martyrs, report the process, invite them to Beijing to identify the bones, and serve the spirits together. In addition, she has telegraphed the country to report the details, and will also make appropriate requests to our country's diplomatic authorities. She will also appeal to all countries in the world to uphold justice.</p>

<p>Employee General Meeting: The Federation of Employees of the Domestic Goods Department Store held a general meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday to discuss the aftermath and all issues related to employees and workers. More than 600 people attended. Chen Weixin was elected as chairman and reported on the progress of the negotiations.

<p>Social Bureau to Mediate Today</p>
<p>Due to the insincerity of the company in resolving the issues of treatment and conditions, the electrical workers of China General Edison Company implemented a policy of allowing passengers to ride the streetcars without buying tickets. After persuasion by the Social Bureau, they resumed work at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday. The bureau has scheduled mediation today. The situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>Resumption of Work: At 5 p.m. the night before last, the union sent traffic teams to various locations to order ticket sellers to resume work and issued a public notice. By 5:30 p.m., all ticket sellers on routes 1, 2, 3, and 4 resumed selling tickets as usual. The union has scheduled to send Zhou Guangrong, Zhu Hanhe, and three other representatives to the company again at 10 a.m. today to inquire when the general manager will implement the nine signed agreements, when the members of the welfare committee will be appointed, when medical matters will be discussed, when workers' life insurance will be implemented, and when the amount of retirement pay before the end of May 20 will be settled.</p>
<p>Union Statement: A reporter from the New Voice News met with the executive director of the union yesterday. According to him, the members of the union have been unable to make ends meet due to soaring prices, so on March 25, the general meeting passed a resolution to improve treatment. However, the company showed no sincerity. After repeated mediation by the Social Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and the Municipal Party Department, nine conditions were signed on May 28, stipulating that they would be implemented from June 1. The issues of workers' bonuses and housing were to be negotiated separately. Until now, the nine conditions have not been implemented. The union has repeatedly negotiated unsuccessfully. The day before yesterday, the representative general meeting resolved to implement a policy of allowing passengers to ride the streetcars without buying tickets to promote awareness. After receiving the instructions from the Social Bureau, the union sent representatives to inquire with the company. The company made various excuses and gave no concrete answers. After repeated persuasion by Xu Zhi of the Social Bureau, in order to obey the orders of the higher authorities, they immediately resumed work at 5 p.m. If the company is still insincere in today's mediation, the second warning will be given.</p>
<p>Mediation Today: In order to quickly resolve the China General Edison Company workers' strike, the Municipal Social Bureau, in addition to ordering the company to fulfill the nine conditions that have been agreed and signed by both labor and management, immediately sent personnel to persuade the workers to resume work and wait for mediation. It has scheduled a mediation committee meeting at 2 p.m. today and invited the Municipal Party Department and the Public Security Bureau to send committee members to participate in the mediation of workers' housing and bonus issues. The first district water and electricity workers' union has appointed Zhu Hanhe and Zhou Guangrong as responsible representatives to attend and await mediation.</p>
<p>Points of Contention: The most intense disputes between labor and management at China General Edison Company that cannot be resolved are the two issues of workers' bonuses and housing. The original proposal and reasons put forward by the labor side are as follows: (1) (Housing) The company allocates 200,000 yuan to purchase land and build workers' housing, limited to completion by the end of the 20th year. Before completion, the company will pay a housing subsidy of 10 yuan per person per month. After completion, if there is not enough space to live in, the workers who do not live in the workers' housing will still be given a housing subsidy. The workers' housing is the property of the company and rented to workers for living. The rent is calculated at 6% weekly interest on the total cost of land purchase and construction. However, the rent for public housing in the workers' housing (such as schools for workers' children and cooperative societies) will be borne by the company. Reason: Workers' housing was stipulated in the 16th year treaty to be built by the company on land it found, but it has been four years and it has not yet been implemented, which is a pity. Therefore, it is specifically limited to completion before the end of the 20th year, and the company is requested to bear the housing subsidy before completion. Workers are not construction experts, and the so-called 200,000 is a hypothetical number. If there is not enough space in the completed housing, the company should still bear the housing subsidy. The completed housing will still be the property of the company and rent will be collected. In the 17th and 18th years, the total amount of the company's loans and bank transactions was more than 500,000 yuan. The company also earns interest by depositing money in the bank. Building workers' housing also earns interest, which does not cause the company any losses. However, the company's interest rate for workers should not be too high, so we request that the rent be calculated at 6% weekly interest. This housing is not only cheaper to rent, but because workers live together, it is easier to run labor businesses such as consumer cooperatives, which can reduce workers' living expenses other than rent. It is estimated that each worker's family living in workers' housing can save 10 yuan per month. Therefore, before and after completion, if they do not live in the workers' housing, the company should pay a housing subsidy of 10 yuan per person per month. (2) Bonuses: From the 20th year onwards, the board of directors will be responsible for submitting a proposal to the shareholders' meeting for the distribution of workers' bonuses. No less than 96% of the net profit each year will be allocated, of which 60% will be used as a fund for labor undertakings, and 40% will be distributed to workers according to the size of their wages. Those who have been reprimanded three times or given a major demerit once in a year will have their share of the surplus reduced by half. Those who have been reprimanded six times or given a major demerit twice will not be given their share of the surplus. The surplus that is reduced or not given will be used to fund labor undertakings. Reason: According to Article 55 of the revised company charter in the 18th year, Article 5 of the 16th year, and the previous treaty, 3/15 is equal to 4.2% of the company charter. According to the previous treaty, workers get 60% of 3/15, which is 3/25, and staff get 40% of 3/15, which is 2/25. According to the company charter, shareholders get 16.8% of the 21%, which is 20/25. So the proportion of surplus is three to two for workers and staff, and three to twenty for workers and shareholders. The ratio of the number of workers to staff is five to one. Why is the proportion of surplus three to two? Why is the surplus divided among shareholders four times that of staff and workers? We cannot understand it after much thought. But the result is very clear: those with money get more, and the rich get richer. Those without capital who sell their labor get less, and the poor are always poor. Sun Yat-sen said, "The purpose of our Kuomintang's livelihood principle is to equalize the wealth in society." He also said, "Prevent the big problem of unequal wealth in the future society." The current method of distributing surplus is one of the causes of this big problem. When promoting party ideology under the blue sky and white sun, this cause of disease cannot be allowed to exist. The original elements of running a company are capital and labor. The size of the rewards should be determined by the level of efficiency. The reward for capital is dividends, and the reward for labor is wages. Logically, rewards can represent the level of efficiency, but the current facts are not necessarily so. However, it is undeniable that the only ones who suffer are the workers who sell their labor. Now we painfully admit that the current reward can represent the level of efficiency. Then, at a minimum, the distribution of surplus should also be determined according to the current reward. According to the company's business report for the 18th year, the salaries of staff were 125,000 yuan, the capital dividend was 240,000 yuan, and the workers' wages were 339,000 yuan (disregarding the remainder). The proportion of the three rewards is: staff is 1 (actual 1.92), capital is 2, and workers is 3 (actual 2.73). That is, workers should get half of the total surplus, or at least acknowledge 1% of the 21% stipulated in the company's charter as the interest of preferred shares, and 8% as the interest of the founders' red shares. There is still 19.2% left. Workers should get at least half of this 19.2%. Therefore, we demand that workers should not get less than 96% of the 21% in the surplus. We should follow Sun Yat-sen's instructions and use the surplus we get to "improve the lives of laborers." We will use 60% as a fund for labor undertakings to run labor businesses to improve the lives of members. This is the most cost-effective way. At the same time, we will take into account the special circumstances of each member and distribute the remaining part to each member for their own disposal. Reducing and not giving surplus due to mistakes is in accordance with the provisions of Article 40 of the Factory Law. As for the surplus that is reduced or not given, it is not a benefit that the company should get, so please allocate it to the funds for labor undertakings.</p>
<h3 id="e83">News from Various Unions <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Second District Silk Weaving Industry Union: Declaration Regarding Jinxin Silk Factory's Unjustified Refusal to Allow Work (Summary omitted above) We, the workers of Jinxin Silk Factory, believe that Zhu Zijin, a weaver at the factory, exerted some effort during the strike, which incurred the factory's disfavor. They were determined to get rid of him. (Middle section omitted) The metal piece on Zhu Zijin's loom was borrowed from a carpenter's workbench and was not an item from the wooden box. It was for repairing the loom. How could the slanderers, upon seeing the metal piece, immediately assume that the lost silver dollars were stolen by him? What is this but slander? Even if Zhu Zijin had indeed stolen something, it is a personal matter. He should be punished accordingly. What crime have all the workers committed to be rejected? According to investigations into labor-management disputes, the factory is not allowed to shut down, and the workers are not allowed to strike without going through the mediation procedures of the relevant authorities. The authorities' repeated orders are clear for all to see. The factory relies on the concession as a shield and dares to deceive the government above and oppress the workers below. The facts are all there and need no further explanation. How can this union remain silent? We will fight for what is right, but like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, our efforts may be futile. We hope that all workers in the city will sympathize and support us in rescuing the hundred or so workers of Jinxin Silk Factory from the abyss and fighting for final victory. This union would be most fortunate, and the labor movement would be most fortunate. This declaration is made respectfully.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Heavy Rain Slightly Relieves the Sweltering Heat <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Low-lying Areas Accumulate Water into Puddles</p>
<p>Dog Electrocuted on Zhijiang Road</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer in this city, the humid heat has been scorching, making it difficult to bear. The thermometer often rises to around ninety degrees. This kind of weather is happening even before the hottest period, and people say that this year will be bitterly hot, which is probably not an exaggeration. After the sweltering heat, people are eagerly hoping for thunderstorms; almost everyone feels the same way. Yesterday morning, there was heavy rain, and it cleared up at noon. Then, at about 5:15 PM, there was thunder and lightning again, and heavy rain poured down. The continuous heat was slightly relieved, and the farmers in the surrounding rural areas had just finished transplanting rice seedlings, so this timely rain was also very beneficial.</p>
<p>Torrential Rain: Yesterday morning's heavy rain suddenly cleared up towards noon, and the scorching sun was high in the sky, making it as sweltering as before. It wasn't until 5:10 PM that dark clouds gathered, and it suddenly became gloomy. The heavy rain began to fall from the end of the sky and continued, refreshing people's spirits. In an instant, thunder rumbled, lightning flashed, and the torrential rain poured down. Pedestrians disappeared from the roads, and every household closed their windows and doors. The heavy rain lasted for about half an hour, and then people disappeared from the roads, and every household closed their windows and doors. The heavy rain lasted for about half an hour before it stopped. Several more showers fell in the evening, but they were not as heavy.</p>
<p>Glimpse of the Roads: During the heavy rain, trams and buses generally stopped running. In Zhabei, along Baoshan Road, Taiyangmiao Road, and Chang'an Road, the water was knee-deep in places. In the public concession, near North Zhejiang Road and Sanmalu Tianchan Theater, and at Daxin Street, Racecourse, etc., the water accumulated in the roads to a depth of more than a foot due to the inability of the sewers to drain it. Pedestrians all hired rickshaws to cross, so rickshaw pullers had a prosperous business, earning several times their usual income. In the French concession, along East and West Zilaihuo Streets, Dongjie Bridge Street, Songshan Road, and Baxianqiao, the water was also several inches deep, creating a vast expanse of water. Cars splashed water everywhere, and many pedestrians had their clothes soiled. The Suzhou River suddenly swelled, rising by more than a foot.</p>
<p>Everything Turned into a Swamp: Low-lying areas were ankle-deep in water after the rain, turning everything into a swamp. Many of the shacks built by Jiangbei migrants along Xiaoshadu Road and Roberts Road in Western Shanghai, as well as the Taiyangmiao and Suzhou River banks in Zhabei, were washed away by the rain. The lowest-lying areas were more than a foot deep in water, and the water did not recede all night.</p>
<p>Lights Extinguished: During the heavy rain, the lights suddenly went out in the Datong Road and Nanxing Road areas of Zhabei. It was found that the power lines had been broken by the rain. However, the lights were restored to their original state shortly after. It was also heard that a wild mulberry tree on Zhijiang Temple Road was struck by lightning and fell, and a yellow dog was electrocuted to death.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Fierce Battle in Ladu Road to Capture Thieves <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>One Thief Killed, Four Thieves Escaped</p>
<p>Both the Vietnamese Constable and Western Detective Were Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, a dye shop on Ladu Road in the French Concession was robbed. At the time, a Western detective, a Vietnamese constable, and a patrolman happened to be passing by. The two sides exchanged gunfire. As a result, one thief was killed, and the Western detective and Vietnamese constable were seriously injured. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Five Thieves Suddenly Arrive at the Dye Shop: The dye and weaving factory at 393-6 Ladu Road in the French Concession, owned by a Zhang family and named Jinhua, had a relatively prosperous business. Unexpectedly, it attracted the attention of thieves. Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, five thieves suddenly arrived, each wearing different styles of clothing. Two thieves were armed with pistols. After entering the shop, they first drove all the shop assistants and servants into one room and then divided up to search as they pleased.</p>
<p>Shop Assistant Secretly Follows the Thieves: The thieves searched the room thoroughly, but apart from various silks, there was nothing of value. The thieves discarded these easily identifiable stolen goods and only snatched a gold ring from an employee's hand before leaving the shop in frustration. At that time, a shop assistant named Jia, who was very alert, secretly followed the thieves, waiting for an opportunity to act.</p>
<p>Thieves and Constables Shot: After leaving the shop, the thieves fled north. Jia followed closely behind, tailing them to near Ladu Road and Avenue Joffre. Not far from the factory, about 300 yards away, Vietnamese Constable Jia, number 112, was standing there. Jia secretly informed the constable, who quickly drew his gun and fired at the thieves. One thief fell in response, and the remaining thieves returned fire wildly. The constable was hit in the waist by a bullet and immediately fell to the ground in pain.</p>
<p>Western Detective Injured in Both Feet: During the exchange of gunfire, Western Detective Mamlone from the special agency political department of the French Police Department happened to be returning to his residence at 97 Ladu Road by car. He saw the Vietnamese constable fall to the ground and, without regard for danger, jumped out of the car with his gun and exchanged fire with the thieves. As a result, the detective was shot twice in the foot, and a stray bullet injured a Russian man riding in a rickshaw. The police department heard the alarm and immediately dispatched detectives to search and arrest the thieves. The four thieves had already disappeared without a trace. A pistol was found near the injured thief. The injured people and the thief were taken to the hospital for treatment in separate vehicles.</p>
<p>Injured Thief Died After Unsuccessful Treatment: The injured thief was taken to Guangci Hospital, where he died after unsuccessful treatment due to the severity of his injuries. The hospital notified the police department, which sent detectives to transport the thief's body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch mortuary for an autopsy. The thief was wearing a white undershirt, Xiangyun gauze pants, and a toupee with a flat top. He was wearing gray silk stockings and iron machine flower satin shoes. The bullet entered from the left breast near the front of the chest and grazed between the left and right eyebrows. It is said that the Vietnamese constable's injuries are also severe.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Heartless Female Waitress <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Lovesick Man Commits Suicide by Poisoning</p>
<p>Wei Fuyuan from Pudong, 28 years old, was formerly the manager of Huaxingcheng Board Box Store at New Garbage Bridge. Recently, he resigned on July 1 due to disagreements with the store owner. He immediately took his luggage to Huashang Villa on Haining Road and temporarily resided in room 34. Yesterday morning at 3:30 AM, he suddenly secretly swallowed a large dose of lifeproducing smoke poison to commit suicide. Later, the waiter discovered it and urgently reported it to the accounting room, which in turn reported it to the Huishi police station. Officer 601 was ordered to come and send him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. His body was immediately transported to the mortuary for an autopsy, pending a report to the court for an examination. It is said that three years ago, Wei opened a Wei Hecheng Board Box Shop in Xingye Li on North Shanxi Road. He often went to the Tianyun Building of Yong'an Company to hang out, where he met a female waitress from Songjiang named Zhu Pin Fang. They were deeply in love, feeling like they had met each other too late. Over time, they began to cohabitate, and he gave Zhu Pin Fang 20 yuan a month. However, fate was fickle, and the store's business suffered too much losses. By January of this year, it was unsustainable and eventually closed down. Zhu, seeing this unfavorable situation, fled without a trace. At this time, Wei suffered this misfortune and was extremely depressed, like someone drunk or crazy, for about ten days. Later, through the recommendation of colleagues, he was hired at Huaxingcheng Store. However, he never forgot about Zhu Pin Fang. When he had free time, he went to the North Railway Station area to search for her. The day before yesterday (the 3rd), he met Zhu on the road, and they went to Huashang Villa for a night of secrecy. Yesterday morning, Zhu suddenly made an excuse to go out, saying that she would return in a moment. Wei believed it to be true and had no doubts. Until midnight, she had not returned. For a moment, overwhelmed by anger, he suddenly had the thought of death and committed suicide by poisoning. It is also very pitiful.</p>

<p>Chief Chen of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau issued proclamation Zheng Zi No. 14 yesterday, which reads: "Regarding the matter of issuing a proclamation, it is noted that racing cars and horses is already prohibited. Recently, with the arrival of the hot summer, many residents of this city are taking cars out for pleasure, even increasing their speed and overtaking at will, resulting in frequent accidents. This bureau's duty is to strictly prohibit this behavior in order to prevent danger. In addition to ordering the chiefs of each district to instruct the police to investigate and prohibit this behavior at all times, it is hereby proclaimed for everyone to be aware. In the future, if it is found that any car is racing for pleasure or increasing its speed to overtake, it will be punished and no leniency will be given. This is a crucial proclamation."</p>

<p>At about 10:00 PM the night before last, there were many people cooling off on the steps of the train station road in front of the local court. At that time, a car sped past. The area was being repaired by the Zhenghua Chinese Electric Company, and gravel was piled on the side of the road. Unexpectedly, the car drove onto the gravel and crashed straight onto the steps, knocking down and seriously injuring two street vendors at the same time. The patrolling police took the driver into custody at the Second District Police Station for interrogation, and the injured people were sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Issue with Liquor Industry Permit Occurs <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Public Monopoly Bureau Representative Provides No Definite Response</p>
<p>Will Petition Various Agencies for Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Liang Liquor Industry Association convened an emergency meeting of all members at 2:00 PM yesterday because the Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol Public Monopoly Bureau failed to issue liquor storage permits in accordance with regulations. More than 30 members of the association attended. Zhou Chaozhang and Fang Qinbo, representatives from the Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol Public Monopoly Bureau, and He Xiangsheng, chairman, attended the meeting. The chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that it had been four days since the Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol Public Monopoly Bureau opened, and the bureau had failed to issue liquor storage permits to the various businesses in accordance with regulations. Today, representatives from the Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol Public Monopoly Bureau are attending the association's general meeting and should provide an explanation to dispel the members' doubts. Zhou Chaozhang, a representative from the Bureau, spoke, stating that the reason the bureau had not issued the liquor storage permits to the various businesses was that the former Second District Bai Liquor Public Monopoly Tax Collection Office had not completed the transfer, so there was no basis for issuing the permits. Zhang Guanshou, Zhu Qingtang, and He Xiangsheng then spoke one after another, stating that the Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol Public Monopoly Bureau and the Second District Bai Liquor Public Monopoly Tax Collection Office were both state taxation agencies, and the public fees paid by merchants to the Second District Bai Liquor Public Monopoly Tax Collection Office were naturally valid. There was no reason for the state agency to interrupt the service. Since one side has already opened, the other side must have already completed the transfer. The Bureau's failure to issue the liquor storage permits in violation of regulations has caused the merchants to suspend business and suffer great losses. Fang Qinbo, a representative from the Bureau, then spoke, stating that the Bureau should urge the former office to complete the transfer in order to have a basis for issuing the liquor storage permits. He Xiangsheng and Zhu Qingtang replied that the transfer issue was the responsibility of the Bureau and the former office and that the merchants had no right to interfere. Furthermore, the merchants did not know when the Tax Collection Office would complete the transfer. They requested that the Bureau immediately send people to investigate the inventory of each business and issue the liquor storage permits. Otherwise, the merchants would suspend business, resulting in great losses, and would have to publish a statement in the newspaper and petition for relief. At this point, the Bureau representatives announced their withdrawal, and the discussion began: (1) The Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol Public Monopoly Bureau has not issued liquor inventory permits, and the Bureau's representatives have not provided a definite response for a long time, hindering business and violating regulations. How should this be handled? Resolution: A. Petition the National Government, the Ministry of Finance, and the Provincial Bureau for relief. B. Send a letter to the Bureau to negotiate. C. Publish a statement in the newspaper based on regulations, explaining the association's position. (2) The newspaper reported that the Fuji Distillery, etc., had recorded the number of Yellow Liquor Public Monopoly prices, fearing that there would still be floating prices in the future. Should the association express its opinion? Resolution: Publish a statement in the newspaper, stating that if there are any changes to the regulations, the association will firmly oppose them. (3) Xu Qingrong, a representative from Tongdeyong Liquor Store, sent a letter stating that he would transfer the brand name to Li Guangzhen and add Huiji and requested registration. Resolution: If the store pays the overdue fees in full, it will be registered. The meeting was adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Ye Zengshou's Car Found After His Kidnapping <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>In Jungong Road, Jiansong Bridge</p>
<p>Was Picked Up by Ye's Wife Yesterday</p>
<p>The kidnapping of Ye Zengshou, the manager of Zhongfu Foreign Company, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has now been learned that Ye's car was found at about 1:00 AM yesterday on the south side of Jiansong Bridge on Jungong Road. The patrolmen from the Yinhang police station of the First Precinct of the Seventh Public Security District spotted the car parked on the side of the road, unattended, which was very suspicious. They immediately recorded the license plate number and sent a guard to watch the car. At the same time, they reported it to the First Precinct of the Seventh District in Wusong. Soon, they saw a report stating that the car Ye Zengshou was riding in when he was kidnapped had a concession license plate of 4529 and a municipal government license plate of 5044, which matched the license plate number of the car abandoned on the side of the road. The precinct chief, Zhang Jiguang, notified the police in the Fourth Station of the Fifth Precinct to assist in the search. At about 10:00 AM, Xu Huanming, an employee of Zhongfu Foreign Company, and Mei Guangen, the driver who was present at the time of the incident, found the car near Jiansong Bridge in another car. They saw police officers guarding the car and knew that it was abandoned there by the kidnappers. They drove the car back to the First Precinct of the Seventh District. Then, at about 5:00 PM in the afternoon, Ye's wife, Fan, reported the incident to the police station and picked up the car. The precinct chief briefly questioned the driver, Mei Guangen. Ye's wife, Fan, testified that the driver had been employed for many years and was very honest and had nothing to do with the case. He was not detained and returned with Ye's wife. However, the hostage is still missing and is currently under strict search.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Fei Jianzai Protests the Transfer <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Claiming That It Is Difficult Made by Former Subordinates</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government previously sent detectives to Shanghai to file a lawsuit with the French Court against Fei Jianzai for repeatedly committing serious crimes of kidnapping in the interior, requesting approval for his transfer. The defendant hired a lawyer to oppose the extradition, and the hearing was postponed. He was summoned again the other day, and the messenger still requested extradition. The defendant's lawyer claimed that the defendant had worked in the military in 1927 and had been living and working peacefully in the district after retiring for many years. This was actually caused by the dissatisfaction of the defendant's former subordinates. Moreover, the plaintiff has never submitted any evidence, which clearly shows that the allegations are untrue. He requested that the defendant be released. The Chinese and Western judges ordered a postponement of fourteen days, limiting the plaintiff to submit evidence before another hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Continued Hearing in the Case of Fan Abao Claiming Property After College Student Missing <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Witness Testimony Unfavorable to Abao</p>
<p>The Court Will Investigate the Guarantor</p>
<p>Since the disappearance of Ni Guangxun, a student at Great China University, last winter, Fan Abao, who claims to be Ni's wife, suddenly filed a lawsuit with the civil court of the Special District Court against Ni's sister, Zeng Ni Liujie, accusing her of encroaching on the family property and refusing to return it. The case has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper after several summons. The Special Court summoned the defendant, Zeng Ni Liujie, again the other day, and she was still represented by her lawyer, Zhang Deqin. The plaintiff, Fan Abao, first stated that today's witness, Ni Wenming, has arrived in court and is fully aware of all the facts of the case. Please question him. The judge then questioned Ni Wenming, asking whether the plaintiff, Fan Abao, was actually Ni Guangxun's wife and whether the property was deposited with Zeng. Ni Wenming replied that Fan Abao was definitely not Guangxun's wife. Fan's position and identity were already very clear. As for the deposit, it did exist, but Guangxun had used it all up when he was studying in Shanghai, leaving only forty taels. There is a bank passbook to prove this. As for the claim that Guangxun voluntarily gave Fan two thousand taels, it cannot be deeply believed based solely on empty words. The plaintiff's request to demand the return of the property from the defendant based on what kind of status is a fundamental error and an extravagant desire. It should be rejected. The interrogator stated that although the plaintiff's request for litigation relief in this case had been approved, the guarantor provided had not been clearly investigated and announced a postponement of the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Eleven Male and Female Thieves Arrested <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Mauser Gun Belonged to a Dutchman</p>
<p>Investigation Reveals Theft by Two Resigned Servants</p>
<p>Feng Baishun, a Chinese detective from the Huishi Police Department, along with detectives Shang Wu and Xizhu, received a report from informants the other morning that a gang of thieves was conspiring in a restaurant at 717 Zhejiang Road, with the intention of committing illegal acts. The Chinese and Western detectives secretly went to the restaurant around 7:00 AM and arrested the thieves, Gu Ronggen and Wang Shengrong. They then went to Fuzhou Road and arrested Zhang Aqing and a woman, Tang Sumei. Zhang confessed that there were accomplices hiding in room 21 of the Shangxi Inn on Simalu. The Chinese and Western detectives went there and arrested Wei Kouzi and a woman, Zhang Jinfeng, and found two fake pistols under the floor. They then went to 330 Beihai Road and arrested Chen Luhai, Tang Enqing, and Zhu Hong. A Mauser gun was found in a</p>
<p>leather suitcase. They then went to 634 Dagu Road and arrested Xue Baoquan and his mistress, Xue Yan. A total of eleven men and women were arrested one after another and taken back to the police station. The other morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stepped forward to state the previous events and claimed that the defendants had used weapons to rob property at 49 Fujian Road. As for the Mauser gun that was seized, it has also been confirmed that the gun came from a Dutchman named Lamboo, who lived at 250 Hongqiao Road. In March of this year, Lamboo carried the gun to the工部局 to obtain a license and then left Shanghai. His wife also went to the hospital for treatment in April or May, so she locked the pistol in the cabinet. Until yesterday, when the Chinese and Western detectives went to investigate, the Western woman did not know that the gun had been stolen. The key was not damaged, and there were no signs of forced entry on the cabinet. It is suspected that it was done by two of the Western woman's servants, who resigned in May while the Western woman was in the hospital. Therefore, they are highly suspicious of these two people.

<h3 id="e95">Doctor and Scribe's Extortion Letter Scam <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Zhai Miaogen's Confession Seems Convincing</p>
<p>Jiang Xiyuan Still Claims Slander</p>
<p>Jiang Weibin, a local resident and owner of the slaughterhouse located at 16 Fengtian Road, received multiple threatening letters from gangsters between July of last year and June 28th of this year, totaling seven letters. Initially, they demanded 2,000 yuan, later reduced to 1,200 yuan. They also arranged a meeting near the Longwang Temple in the Nanhui County area of Pudong. Jiang reported this to the police, who dispatched detectives and apprehended three suspects: Jiang Xiyuan (also known as Xiguang), Qian Zhensen, and Zhai Miaogen, all from Pudong. They were handed over to the Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention.</p>
<p>The previous morning, Judge Xiao Xieufen held a further trial. The police lawyer stated that the defendant Zhai Miaogen had confessed to writing the threatening letters at the police station. After investigation, it was found that Qian Zhensen was not involved in the case and should be released. Zhai Miaogen, questioned as a doctor, confessed that he knew Jiang Xiguang and was asked to write two letters to Jiang Weibin demanding 2,000 yuan. Because he was related to Jiang, it was inconvenient for him to write the letters himself. The meeting place was inside the Xiaoshijie Amusement Park in the city. However, Jiang had a headache and couldn't go at the last minute, so he asked me to go. At the time, I was hesitant and consulted a fortune teller who said there was no sign of wealth, so I didn't go to the negotiation. In June of last year, Jiang came again, saying that the previous two letters had demanded too much, and now he wanted to reduce the demand to 1,200 yuan, which would be effective. So I wrote several more letters based on his drafts. Recently, Jiang came and said that Jiang Lao Ban had introduced business and still planned to proceed with the extortion, asking me to write a letter to arrange a meeting at the Dajing Class in Sincere Company.</p>
<p>When questioned, Jiang Xiguang claimed that Zhai Miaogen's confession was entirely fabricated and was a malicious slander. He asked for a clear judgment. Judge Xiao reviewed the confessions and ordered Qian Zhenmiao to provide a guarantee to be available for summons at any time. Jiang and Zhai were returned to custody, and the trial was adjourned.</p>

They apprehended two bandits south of Chenjia, and recovered a fake pistol, an iron chisel, and the original stolen money of one dollar and eight dimes from them.</p>
<p>Under interrogation, they confessed. One, Xia Baozi, 32 years old, from Dongtai, lived in Caonitang, Yangjiadu, and worked as a dock coolie. The other, Shi Songmingshan, 25 years old, from Suqian, lived with Xia. Both bandits admitted that they were driven by poverty to rob passersby. They also revealed the name of their accomplice, Cai Zhanxian, who was hiding at 1 Xintongtang, Yangjiadu. Captain Xu sent the original squad members to arrest Cai and brought him back to the team. A single-edged sword and a flashlight were found in Cai's home. Yesterday, the witnesses were handed over to the corps headquarters and then transferred to the Third District Public Security Bureau for forwarding to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

Just when we hoped that the war would end and the people could rest, Heaven has brought down misfortune again. According to reports from Song County, Wen County, Wuyang County, Mianchi County, Lushi County, and other counties, starting from the date of the May Equinox, strong winds, torrential rain, and hailstones fell, with some as large as fists or eggs, and others shaped like beans or chestnuts. The disaster lasted for several hours, covering hundreds of miles. Unharvested wheat and newly grown crops were scorched and withered, and the destruction was almost complete. In several places, people and livestock were injured. The bandit Cui surrounded and attacked Nanyang, occupying the North Gate for several days, burning and looting Wen County with inhuman cruelty. He then led his troops to attack and capture Tanghe County, burning, killing, raping, and looting. More than two thousand people died, and over ten thousand were captured. Recently, they have been harassing Deng County, Nanzhao County, Tongbai County, and other places. The bandit army leaves villages and settlements in ruins, with fires burning brightly at night and killings rampant during the day. The disaster is even worse than the ravages of the Ming Dynasty bandit Li Zicheng. Daily reports of disasters are pouring in. Our commission has a responsibility to provide relief, but we lack the means. Therefore, we briefly describe the situation and urgently appeal to you to have compassion for the suffering people and provide large-scale relief. A drop of nectar can save countless lives, and millions of mourning people are awaiting your merciful protection. We eagerly await your reply.

<p>To the Editor, I recently read in your newspaper's local news column that Li Qihuan, a fake Chief of Staff and native of Jinshan, has sneaked into Shanghai and is hiding on the upper floor of the Dahe Rice Shop at No. 22 Tangjiawan, and was arrested by the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Upon investigation, there is only one Dahe Rice Shop in Tangjiawan, with the address of No. 176-177 Lanwei'ai Road, Tangjiawan, rented by our shop and Gao Yu Ji's landlord, and we live upstairs and downstairs ourselves. There is no subletting, which seems inconsistent with the facts reported in your newspaper. We are afraid that the outside world will misunderstand the truth, so we specifically request you to correct this quickly to avoid misunderstanding. Sincerely, Dahe Rice Shop, July 5, 20th year.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Draft Budget for Education Expenses in Jiangsu Province for the 20th Year (Shi Zhang) <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The total amount of full collection and full expenditure is 4.88 million yuan.</p>
<p>16,552 yuan less than last year.</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. The 19th year has already ended, and the 20th year has come again. At this time last year, the reporter was collecting materials for "A Summary of the Budget for Education Expenses in Jiangsu Province in the 19th Year" (that article appeared in this newspaper on July 19, 20, and 21 of the 19th year). Now, the draft budget for education expenses in Jiangsu Province for the 20th year has been established. Jiangsu is the leading province, and its education expenses have long been independent, and the amount is larger than in other provinces, so many people are concerned about this matter. Now, based on what the reporter has heard and seen, the budget proposal for the 20th year will be described in detail below.</p>
<h3 id="e117">(1) The Process of Establishing the Budget <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>In early February this year, the Jiangsu Provincial Government issued a notice to all agencies in the province, requiring that all budget proposals for the 20th year be submitted to the Department of Finance for compilation by the end of February. According to the organizational principles of the Jiangsu Education Expense Committee, preparing the budget is one of the committee's responsibilities. Therefore, the committee held its 23rd meeting on February 27 at the Jiangsu Education Department in Zhenjiang. The committee members who attended were Ye Chucang, Chen Hexian, Wu Jingheng, Niu Yongjian, Chen Qicai, Zheng Yanghe, Liu Yizheng, Gao Yang, Wang Maozu, Ma Ketan, Gu Yuxiu, and eleven others. They discussed the budget issue for a full five hours - from 3:20 pm to 8:20 pm. As a result, only the revenue figures for provincial education in the 20th year were stipulated, totaling:</p>
<p>Land tax allocation: 2,500,000 yuan</p>
<p>Slaughter tax: 650,000 yuan</p>
<p>Brokerage tax: 650,000 yuan</p>
<p>(The above three items are the income of the Education Expense Management Office, totaling 3,800,000 yuan.)</p>
<p>Provincial treasury subsidy: 300,000 yuan</p>
<p>Tuition and lodging fees from various schools: 180,000 yuan</p>
<p>Outstanding funds allocated by the Ministry of Finance: 600,000 yuan</p>
<p>Total: 4,880,000 yuan</p>
<p>It was also resolved that the Education Department should compile an expenditure budget within this scope, taking into account the actual needs, and submit it to the meeting for discussion. This is the situation for determining the revenue.</p>
<p>After receiving the above resolution, the Education Department immediately began to compile the expenditure budget. However, the total revenue was less than last year, and on the expenditure side, not only could the original ones not be reduced, but in fact, many that had to be increased, such as the natural addition of grades in primary and secondary schools, the increase in teaching hours in junior high schools, the addition of vocational subjects in various middle schools, the addition of grades and equipment for rural teachers, the Jiangbei Farmers Education Center, the addition of grades in the Education College, and the natural development of social education institutions, etc., totaled 262,000 yuan, all of which were absolutely indispensable. Therefore, under these circumstances, the Education Department found it extremely difficult to consider adjustments and allocate funds. At the same time, it was also necessary to urge schools to compile and submit for review in advance. The exchange of official documents took quite a while. Therefore, it was not until the end of May that this part of the work was completed, taking almost three months.</p>
<p>The Education Department has received the "Draft Outline for the Distribution of Provincial Education Budget for the 20th Year" for drafting. The Education Expense Committee tentatively scheduled its 24th meeting for June 12. Just at that time, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee was being held, and members Ye and Wu were unable to come to the province, so it was rescheduled to the 23rd. The members who attended were almost the same as last time. It took four hours - from 3:35 pm to 7:40 pm - and finally the general amount of expenditures was resolved. Now, the general amounts of each item are listed below, and compared with the previous year:</p>
<p>Item Twentieth Year Amount Nineteenth Year Amount Comparison</p>
<p>1.  Higher Education Expenses 1,339,152 yuan 1,399,152 yuan No increase or decrease</p>
<p>2.  General Education Expenses 2,472,101 yuan 2,304,101 yuan Increase of 168,000 yuan</p>
<p>3.  Social Education Expenses 630,587 increase 542,161 yuan Increase of 88,000 yuan</p>
<p>4.  Study Abroad Expenses 175,000 yuan 172,000 yuan No increase or decrease</p>
<p>5.  Other Agency Expenses 107,772 yuan 78,522 yuan Increase of 29,250 yuan</p>
<p>6.  General Reserve Fund 95,388 yuan 397,190 increase Decrease of 301,82 yuan</p>
<p>Total 4,880,000 yuan 4,896,552 yuan Decrease of 16,552 yuan</p>
<p>Looking at the list on the right, comparing this year with last year, although the content has increased or decreased, the total amount has decreased by 16,552 yuan this year. The key lies in the transfer of the general reserve fund. (According to the trial budget regulations promulgated by the central government, the reserve fund should account for 1% to 5% of the total amount. The current general reserve fund of 95,388 yuan is still less than 2% of the total amount of 4,880,000 yuan.)</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>

<p>1.  Continue to compile a vocabulary of commonly used words for the masses; 2. Continue to compile a Thousand-Character Primer on the Three Principles of the People for rural use; 3. Continue to translate scientific terminology;</p>
<p>Regarding the Review of Textbooks and Teaching Materials</p>
<p>1.  Continue to review textbooks and teaching guides for various subjects in elementary and middle schools and mass schools; 2. Continue to review children's books; 3. Continue to review educational instruments and specimens; 4. Continue to review books on the history of national humiliation, diplomatic history, and books related to party ideology;</p>

<p>World Tennis Tournament Concludes, America Wields Power and Wins Doubles Championship Again</p>
<p>[Lord, Van Ryn, Cochet, Brown]</p>
<p>Women's Doubles Championship [Won by Great Britain]</p>
<p>Mixed Doubles Championship [Won by America]</p>
<p>London, 4th Telegram The 55th Wimbledon World Tennis Tournament, which has been going on for two weeks, concluded today. The singles final was not held, greatly reducing interest. America won a total of three championships, Germany won one, and Great Britain won one.</p>
<p>Men's Doubles Final Results</p>
<p>Lord, Van Ryn (USA) 6-2, 10-8, 9-11, 3-6, 6-3, Cochet, Brown (France)</p>
<p>Women's Doubles Final Results</p>
<p>Mrs. Shebalen, Miss McFord (England) (3-6, 6-3, 6-4), Mrs. Medasa (France), Mrs. Shegard (Belgium)</p>
<p>Mixed Doubles Final Results</p>
<p>Lord, Mrs. Haber (6-3, 1-6, 6-1), Collins, Miss Letley (England)</p>
<p>Two More Championships Go to America</p>
<p>After winning the men's singles championship, America won the men's doubles and mixed doubles finals today, and the championships went west across the Atlantic to America again. The French team of Cochet and Brown surrendered after a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Great Britain's Consolation in Disappointment</p>
<p>Great Britain's consolation in disappointment was that Mrs. Shebalen and Miss McFord won the women's doubles championship.</p>
<p>Wimbledon Tournament Concludes</p>
<p>The 55th Wimbledon World Tennis Tournament has concluded. The process was full of changes and worthy of pondering.</p>
<p>Formidable American Young Players Among the 250 players who joined, the most impressive are the 20-year-old American Hills, who won the men's singles final, and the 19-year-old Wood. The American youth are handsome and swept the world's heroes. The future of American tennis is probably unlimited. And Lord and Van Ryn's doubles are also invincible in the world. Thiel's prediction has not lost the hero's vision.</p>
<p>Astonishing French Rout The most astonishing thing is the complete rout of the French players. Cochet was defeated by the unknown hero Haber in the first week, Bausé was also eliminated in the fourth week, and Borough Chura was defeated in the semi-finals. The most promising doubles was also overcome by the Americans, and no one returned, which was unexpected.</p>
<p>Great Britain's Enthusiasm Dissipated This year, the British team had great ambitions to win the championship. The strength was the strongest in years. Players like Whiteley and Austin were ambitious, but unfortunately, both singles and doubles were defeated by the Americans. A burst of enthusiasm dissipated. The women's champion, Miss Nana, failed, which was the most heartbreaking. Fortunately, they still won a women's doubles championship in the end, which was a little comforting.</p>
<p>Japan's Strength is Still Far Behind Japan's strength is still far behind. Among the five players, Jiro Sato performed the best, reaching the semi-finals in singles before losing to Borough Chura.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Davis Cup Situation</p>
<p>With the Wimbledon tournament over, the Davis Cup final is about to begin. America's power and influence have suddenly increased greatly. Although Great Britain will definitely beat the Czech Republic, it is feared that they are still no match for America. The decisive battle between America and France will once again cause a worldwide sensation.</p>

<p>Last Week's Standard Gold Price Hovered Around 700 Taels</p>
<p>Weekly Situation Saw Slight Increase: Last week, the standard gold price showed a slight increase again, the situation was exceptionally complex and chaotic, unstable and unsettled, fluctuating by ten taels at a time, and dramatically reversing by twenty or thirty taels. People were shocked and didn't know what to do. However, the storm was not as turbulent as the previous week, but still considerable. It was truly because the matter of the US-French war debt was brewing, the news was mixed, and the overseas silver market trended upward. Also, the Shanghai market exchange rate quotation lengthened by one and a half notches, perhaps because the actual transaction prices of the banks were collectively calculated and evened out, so arbitrage gradually approached. However, Chinese merchants frequently sold, still occupying short positions. As for the gold market, from the lowest price at the beginning of the week, it suddenly became 685 taels, and the highest price was 721 taels. Mid-week coincided with the bank's semi-annual settlement, with two days of holiday. After resuming, it hovered around 700 taels, with the upper limit around 710 taels and the lower limit between 690 taels. This week, there was a difference of 36 taels in total calculation, slightly increasing by one and a half taels. This was because there was a lot of arbitrage, but few promissory notes, and the bullish side was greatly hit the previous week, and they were unwilling to accept it, so they bought in again, hoping to pull it up. Perhaps the silver market and the exchange rate increased, but were unmoved. It is found that the current Dalian gang and Fu Chang Yuan Heng, and arbitrageurs are all in long positions, while the short positions are like Run Chang Xiang, Da Xing, Yong Heng Xing, etc. As for the spot goods, they were only collected and settled on the 3rd of this month (referring to those that had not been rolled over in July), totaling more than 20,000 notes. Yesterday, it was heard that there were still 7,000 or 8,000 notes, which had not been settled due to account transfer. The quoted price for day-to-day settlement was initially pressed down by more than 40 taels to around 30 taels, and finally more than 20 taels. As for the "red notes," they were increased by fourteen or fifteen taels compared to the standard gold price. Recently, the sales channels of Tianjin and other gangs were still active, and they were sold to them by Ying Feng Heng and other gold shops. However, the inventory is insufficient, or there is potential for an increase. Now, the general situation of this week is excerpted below.</p>
<p>Total Increase of Two and a Half Taels for the Whole Week: From Tuesday (June 29), the large promissory note increased by 375, the silver price rose by 625, the initial telegraphic transfer lengthened by one notch, and then shortened. The internal market was initially loose and then tight, and the trade had some collusion. Perhaps the gold market fell and then rose again, and storms arose, with a dramatic reversal of thirty-three or thirty-four taels. It opened early at 686 and a half taels, plummeted fifteen and a half taels, because France seemed to agree to the war debt, so people were fearful, and the sellers were strong. The next sudden increase was to 85 taels. Later, speculator Mr. Wu bought in, and the short sellers also covered their positions, so the price quickly turned to the peak. At noon, the HSBC quotation lengthened and then shortened, and then broke through the 700-tael mark, reaching 711 and a half taels. The afternoon was particularly strong, and buyers were like clouds, once rising to eighteen and a half taels. By the close of the market, it slightly declined, calculated at fifteen taels and eight cents, an increase of thirteen taels and eight cents compared to last Saturday. The next day, the large promissory note returned to a low of 0625, the silver price shortened by 375, and the telegraphic transfer remained unchanged, but the after-hours market was loose. The trade initially settled and then exited. The standard gold price opened down by four taels and eight cents, at 711 taels, actually because the Bank of England slightly contracted. However, the foothold was still good, and it immediately rebounded. Moreover, large clients competed to buy, and it was also reported that the French war debt matter was still under discussion, and people cheered up, and it suddenly soared ten taels, reaching 721 taels. Afterwards, the selling pressure surged, the exchange market seemed weak, plummeting by twenty taels, and then rising again, rising and falling constantly. The noon closing was 06 taels, and in the afternoon it reached 701 taels, and then 09 taels and eight cents. The Indian exchange rate turned small, and the telegraphic transfer was also firm. By the close of the market, it was 06 and a half taels, a drop of nine taels and three cents compared to the previous day. However, the transaction was not large, because the bank was settling accounts and should suspend the market for two days, in order to prevent major changes. There was also a dramatic reversal of twenty taels before and after the market. On Wednesday, there was a holiday, but the large promissory note shrank by two-fifths, and the silver price remained unchanged. The market remained closed the next day. The large promissory note returned to a length of 0625, and the silver price was as before. On Friday, the large promissory note remained unchanged, and the silver price lengthened by 125. The telegraphic transfer lengthened by half a notch, the internal market seemed loose, and Chinese merchants sold more and settled less. The gold market opened down by five taels, at 701 and a half taels, and the sellers were active. Later, it was only calculated at 94 taels, and then it hovered at six or seven taels, once reaching 708 and a half taels. Then Qian Chang Xiang, Yu Da Heng Xing Yuan and others chased in. At noon, it was suddenly heard that the US-French negotiations had deteriorated, and the selling side became even more inflamed, and finally broke through the 700-tael mark. The afternoon was flat, with only three or four taels up and down, from 97 taels to 702 taels. The closing price was 99 taels and four cents, a drop of seven taels and one cent compared to the previous month's record, and there were also fourteen or fifteen taels of twists and turns. The initial Indian exchange rate reported low and small, and then rose again. On Saturday, the large promissory note rebounded by 1875, the silver price increased by half a cent, the telegraphic transfer clearly lengthened by one notch, and the after-hours market tended to be flat. Although some traders sold, the bank's appetite was not bad. The gold price turned weak, opening at 690 taels, down nine taels and four cents, then to 89 and a half taels. Afterwards, the buyers were excited, and Mr. Wu also competed to buy, so the price jumped more than eight taels, to 98 taels. However, the telegraphic transfer was quoted long, and it was heard that the US-French debt matter could be resolved, and it slightly turned downward, to 93 taels. Later, Qian Chang Xiang and others competed to enter, rising to 98 and a half taels, then slightly falling back by more than two taels. At noon, the buyers were even more numerous, and the exchange rate was tight. In an instant, it rushed out of 700 taels, reaching 04 and a half taels, and the closing price was 03 and a half taels, an increase of four taels and one cent compared to the previous day. There were fifteen taels of fluctuations in half a day. After the close of the market, it was done to 05 or 6 taels, and then to 04 taels. People's hearts are trending upward. The high and low prices of the British, American, and Indian silver markets, as well as telegraphic transfer standard gold, are listed below.</p>

The noon market was 7 qian 2 fen 5 li 6 hao and 2 hu and a half. The result was 3 hao and 7 hu and a half smaller than the morning market the day before.

The early morning exchange draft was made for 800,500, and the noon market was 535,000. There was no doing business in the banknote market inside and outside. The Qian Zhuang Ocean Public Orders collected and settled more than 7.4 million, and the Silver Public Orders collected and settled more than 42 million. Because yesterday was the small period, the public order collection and settlement seemed slightly more complicated. The remittance from all roads was more than 300,000, and the small Qian Zhuang transaction was more than 400,000. The early morning market in Jiangnan was 6 qian 5 fen 1 li, and the noon market was 6 qian 5 fen 3 li. The early morning trading volume was 2,000 jiao, and the noon market was 3,500 jiao.

<h3 id="e128">Bond Market in the Week of Securities Settlement Period <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Only Opened for Three Days, Transaction Volume of Several Million</p>
<p>Market Demand Continues to Be Smooth, Prices are Even Stronger Than Before</p>
<p>Last week, the bond market situation in the securities market of this port, except for Monday's handling of the June futures delivery, and Wednesday and Thursday's closure due to the settlement of the first half of the year, there were only three market days in the whole week. Futures trading was still active. August futures have been opened one after another. It is estimated that a total of 42,216,500 yuan was transacted in three days, of which the 20-year Opening Tax transaction was still the most, accounting for 16,510,000 yuan. Other bonds were quieter, such as the 19 Customs of 5 million yuan, the 19 Charity of 4,720,000 yuan, the 20-year Cigarette Tax of 6,785,000 yuan, the Disarmament of 3,345,000 yuan, the Reorganization of 3,085,000 yuan, the 96 Public Bonds of 1,650,000 yuan, the Reorganization of 6% of 710,000 yuan, the Customs Duty of 300,000 yuan, and the 7-year of 15,000 yuan. The Financial Long-term, which has been out of the market for a long time, suddenly transacted 45,000 yuan. The spot goods were as sparse as before, with only 44,000 yuan made in the whole week. Only the 19 Customs accounted for 22,000 yuan, and the rest were only several thousand yuan. As for the changes in the market prices of various bonds in the three days of last week, the current situation is very good, and the bond market environment is quite optimistic. Therefore, the market sentiment is good, and investors are actively buying in, and the momentum is very lively. Looking at the situation of the sellers, they are limited by the supply of existing products. For forward sales, unless there are existing products, they absolutely cannot sell short. Recently, they are also afraid of being squeezed, so they dare not sell too much. Therefore, the popularity of buyers is far more prosperous than selling out. The market prices of various bonds are becoming more and more firm and popular due to the disparity between supply and demand. The prices rise every day, and the trend is very consistent. Looking at the changes, only the prices on Tuesday rose and fell against each other, and the ups and downs were steady. On Friday, the 20 Customs rose by more than 2 yuan, and the 20 Cigarette Disarmament, the 19 Customs Reorganization, etc., all rose by 1 yuan to 1 yuan and 67 cents. On Friday, it is estimated that the 19 Customs Charity 20 Customs Cigarette all rose by about 1 yuan and a half, and the Disarmament 96 each rose by more than 1 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous week, the 20 Customs Cigarette each rose by 23 yuan, and the others were also 1 yuan and several jiao better. Only the Financial 7-year trend was more tired. The statistics of the high and low price changes of each bond in the three days are listed below. (Unit: Yuan)</p>

<p>Last week, the yarn market went straight downstream, because a certain giant merchant sold a large number of long positions, so retail investors were greatly terrified. According to some, there was a saying of turning short, so the situation became more and more empty, and the actual sales were more sluggish. One reason was that too much was absorbed before the festival, and the second reason was that the futures yarn fell sharply. Although the gangs had an appetite, they were helpless and could not do anything. Therefore, the business was relatively cold. As for the gold market, it was also unstable and uncertain, which made people even more dazed. At present, the yarn market is completely affected by manpower. According to the overall situation, there is a possibility of standing firm. What the future holds is difficult to predict. Customer gangs bought 5,584 bales of spot yarn, and 2,300 bales were entered by the same industry. The market price of 20-count Japanese yarn was still flat, while the local yarn fell by two or three taels. The standard yarn price for each month fell by 2.3 taels compared to the previous week. The total transaction was 145,650 bales, and Osaka's three-piece yarn was flat. The amount of bales bought by each gang is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The cotton market was relatively flat and tired last week, with nothing to say. Because the actual sales were bleak, although American cotton rose, the gold market trended soft, and the yarn market was depressed, the pressure was particularly heavy, which made people weaker. However, Japanese merchants bought a huge amount of new cotton futures bales. The standard cotton price for each month fell by four, five, or six cents compared to last week. The total transaction volume for the whole week was 200,250 dan. The source was 900 bales of Yao cotton, 590 bales of wood frame cotton, and American cotton was the same as last week. The manufacturers' appetite was greatly cleared, and there were only 200 pieces of Shaanxi cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Grain and Rice Market Affected by Rain <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, there were not many ships arriving from all directions, and the market was smooth. Buyers of Su and Chang thick japonica rice were particularly eager. The top-grade goods and the middle section each increased by one or two corners. At this time, when there are few goods and thin inventories, and the shops' appetites are also dull, the intention to enter the city is strong, and the price is raised again. Du Bu Jian is also gradually feeling withered. The arrival of early and late rice is slightly scarce. The inland and transshipment gangs have a slight movement. This street's appetite is focused on the various indica rice from the river. Because it slightly increased the day before, the buyers wanted to turn flat and then enter again, so it was once dull. Yesterday, the market situation suddenly changed, and it rose by one foot and a half following the thick japonica rice. Although glutinous rice was firm and stable, it had an upward trend. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's ships loaded a ship of foreign rice, totaling about 70,000 bags of Min Dang rice and small twisted rice. Customer gangs are not moving, and this street is only scattered. The market sentiment is mediocre.</p>
<p>Hunan, Shanghai: Yesterday, there were more than a dozen sources, and the sales market for each gang was very prosperous. Su and Chang thick japonica rice were quite stable at first, returning to the Zhabei rising trend. The opening price in the morning rose by one or two corners, with slight differences in the top and second grades. Ping Li white japonica rice was uniformly raised by a foot. The buyers' attitude is that the source before the Little Heat must be prosperous, so they only follow the entry and exit. Qingjiao Si Song thin rice has risen close to the corner, but the cargo customers are still unwilling to sell too much. Du Yangjian rice from the river is very withered, but there are still daily stocks. The large plate shouted up a foot, and Bai Yuan Yinhua was sold as soon as it arrived, and the price did not rise or fall.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Hardware Factory Nail Price Fell by Half a Cent <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the hardware transaction was more desolate due to the influence of the rainy weather. Except for the factory nails that fell in price by half a cent, selling for 7 taels and 3 qian, with more than a thousand boxes transacted, there were very few other goods open in the city. Only the green iron wire cloth also had 60 or 70 boxes opened in the market yesterday. The market price was 17 taels for miscellaneous brands, 17 taels and 7 qian and a half for chicken brands, and 22 taels for Citibank goods. There were more and more people asking about black iron sheet yesterday, but unfortunately, there were very few transactions. The price was 10 taels and 2 qian and a half for 36 feet, and 11 taels and 5 qian for 26 feet.</p>

<p>— Autumn Waters</p>
<p>Love is like a roulette game. Or a speculative venture. If you want to protect your wealth, it's best not to get involved.</p>
<p>Husbands are like clocks. If you don't wind them, they'll rust and stop obeying you. But if you wind them too much, the spring will break and they'll stop working altogether.</p>
<p>In the old days, winning a woman's love and a kiss from someone of the opposite sex was harder than fishing. You needed real skill and patience. But nowadays, love and kisses are as common as chocolate, available anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>Humans are imitative creatures. Ever since silent film star Clara Bow became famous, the earth has suddenly been filled with many charming women.</p>
<p>The incense and candles in the rainbow temple, the red turbans on the Sikh guards, the nighttime displays in the flesh market, and the scramble to touch Jinlong's hands are all unique features of Nanjing Road in Shanghai. First-time visitors must experience them to complete their trip.</p>
<p>Only fools believe that everything teachers say is gospel.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Facilities a Hotel Should Have <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng (Drunken Fool)</p>
<p>My Opinion on Preventing Suicide</p>
<p>Recently, the number of people who, embracing a pessimistic view of life, decide to move on to another world is increasing daily, and they mostly use hotels as their final destination. Hotels are originally intended for travelers to rest and for men and women to meet secretly. They are designed for the living, not for the dead. But now they have taken on such a function, which the founders never expected. Therefore, if we want to prevent suicide, we must find a way to eliminate it from this base. Deeply saddened by what I have witnessed, I would like to offer the following suggestions for those who run hotels:</p>
<p>(1) Establish an Inspection Department: The Inspection Department should have one director, and one male and one female inspector. They must be sharp-eyed and good at observing people's complexions. Whenever couples or single travelers check in, if they appear abnormal or suspicious, they should be inspected one by one according to the "target shooting" method. Check for smuggled opium, sleeping pills, and other poisons. Once found, the poisons should be confiscated and the guests gently persuaded and refused accommodation. All hotels should follow the same procedure. When these people are repeatedly blocked, they will find it difficult to take action, and will naturally change their minds and abandon the idea of suicide.</p>
<p>(2) Post Numerous Slogans: I remember last year, because so many people were committing suicide by drowning in the Huangpu River, the Social Affairs Bureau erected slogans at various wharves along the river. Since then, it has been quite effective, and the number of suicides in the Huangpu River has decreased. Now, hotels can also follow this example. Various exhortatory slogans should be posted everywhere, in the halls, rooms, even the toilets, bathrooms, and on the bed curtains. Explain the suffering of the soul after suicide, and awaken the deluded. Those who intend to commit suicide, when alone and quiet, will be startled by what they see, and the fear of death will naturally arise.</p>
<p>If the above two measures can be implemented, the number of wronged souls in the city of the unjustly dead will surely be reduced. I piously put my hands together and pray, "Great Compassion, Great Mercy, Savior from Suffering and Calamities, Savior King Bodhisattva."</p>
<h3 id="e147">Predicting Weather Changes from the Form and Movements of Animals <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Feng (Love Peak)</p>
<p>The Opposing Personalities of Dogs and Cats and the Weather: The ancients had a saying, "The hearts of men are as different as their faces," which feels quite stale. Also, commenting on people's incompatible natures is like comparing dogs and monkeys, which is also inevitably musty. However, there are still some interesting points.</p>
<p>When we observe the natural world and the human world, the phenomenon of dogs and monkeys living together is almost nonexistent, except for those who use monkeys for street performances. Moreover, even between parents and offspring, if they are placed in different locations for as long as a month, they will turn against each other and bite, as if they were enemies. This is something we often witness. It is only natural that dogs and monkeys, belonging to different species, should bare their teeth at each other. However, the ancients never compared dogs and cats, which raises questions for us. Dogs and cats can be seen anywhere and anytime, and their irreconcilable opposition is self-evident. Even their ability to predict the weather is different, which is truly interesting. For example, when a dog eats grass, the next day will surely be sunny; when a cat eats grass, the next day will be rainy. Although there are no numerical statistics on the accuracy of this phenomenon, it is more reliable than the saying that a horse's neighing indicates sunshine and a cow's mooing indicates wind. I firmly believe it is accurate.</p>
<p>The Form and Movements of Cows and Cats</p>
<p>(1) A Cow's Long Dribble Indicates Sunshine: The phrase "a cow's dribble is three thousand feet long" is undoubtedly an exaggeration. The length of a cow's dribble varies from day to day, a point that is often overlooked. This is also because the degree of use of the cow varies, such as the weight of the goods carried and the distance of the road. Moreover, it is not easy to judge by observing only a few cows. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the weather on the day and observe many cow carts. If a cow's dribble almost reaches the ground, then the weather will surely be sunny. Based on the results of statistics over two or three years, this phenomenon is rarely seen except on very hot summer days unless it is sunny.</p>
<p>(2) The Way a Cat Washes Its Face: The action of a cat rubbing its face with its front paws is called washing its face. There are two forms:</p>
<p>1.  The action is limited to the face, which is true face washing. 2. The action extends to the back of the head, frequently rubbing both ears, which is a special situation. The former indicates sunshine, and the latter indicates rain. As for the accuracy rate, it is difficult to say for sure, but it is at least more than half certain. However, the reverse phenomenon, that a cat will surely rub its ears before rain, is not necessarily true.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Statistics on "Tips" <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Autumn Waters</p>
<p>Tips, also known as "wine money," or, to put it more elegantly, "rewards." It is almost impossible to go to a social gathering without encountering the prevailing "tipping system." A few years ago, I heard someone say that their home had a telephone, and one year-end, a telephone operator actually asked for wine money over the phone, which shows how prevalent tipping is. No one in society dislikes it.</p>
<p>Recently, the British government conducted a "Tipping Census" in the hope of finding out the current state of this bad habit in society and trying to find a way to improve it.</p>
<p>According to the results of their investigation, the employees who receive the most tips are the porters in large hotels, followed by the male and female waiters in various hotels, restaurants, and other public places. The head porter of a large hotel in London and a head waiter at a certain place earn more than five pounds a week in tips, which is shocking. Other employees, such as waitresses, earn more than two pounds a week. Even the slowest business has at least five to ten shillings in extra income. These people regard tips as their only source of profit, and their meager monthly salaries are not in their minds.</p>
<p>London is a prosperous area of the world, so Londoners are often more generous with tips than others when they go to social gatherings. The most common example is "one tenth." For example, if you dine in a restaurant and the meal costs one yuan, you must pay one jiao (dime) in tips. The minimum limit is three pence for male waiters and two pence for female waiters. Outside of London, the tipping system is far less prevalent than in London. Americans used to have this system, but now they have improved it a lot.</p>
<p>As for our country, this bad habit is also prevalent in society. However, because there are no statistics to study, it is impossible to know the details. However, based on my ideal conjecture, the tea boys in major hotels and the male and female waiters in other public places must earn no less in tips than those in London. And under the special circumstances of Shanghai, the earnings of female waiters are much better than those of male waiters. The National Government once issued an order "prohibiting rewards," and it is hoped that people in society will pay attention to the spread of this bad habit.</p>
<h3 id="e149">A Record of Lotus Petal Rouge <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The Avatamsaka Sutra states that in all the worlds of the Buddhas, the Tathagata is seen sitting on a jeweled lion throne made of lotus flowers. Therefore, the Buddha's throne is called the lotus throne. Wang Zian also wrote the line "The lotus throne has a divine countenance, and the pine cliffs retain sacred traces." The lotus flower stands tall and pure, naturally associated with immortals and Buddhas. I once said that a nude beauty in a giant lotus blossom would possess the beauty of jade-like purity and ice-like clarity. Unexpectedly, after indulging in such fantasies for a long time, I finally saw it in the "Oriental Nights" film produced by a Shanghai film company. During the banquet of King Amita, when the heroes were showing off their talents, there were all kinds of performances. And then, the lotus flower beauty slowly emerged. The lotus was as big as a niche, made of crystal paper, all clear and bright. This slender beauty modestly hid her breasts and looked shy inside. Then, when the mechanism was triggered, the lotus petals spread out and drooped, revealing her beauty. Then she gracefully began to dance and sing the songs of the day, her voice cold and crisp like jade, and her lotus arms and fragrant breasts made people's hearts flutter. This scene should only exist in heaven, and it is rare to see it in the human world. It is truly a feast for the eyes.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Miss Qiu Jin's Daughter, Wang Guifen, Returns from Studying Aviation in America (Part 2) <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Wancheng</p>
<p>If she passed the doctor's examination, aviation organizations from various places would send her reference books for free, allowing her to study aviation in detail without spending a penny. Upon hearing the news, relatives and friends sent letters and telegrams, offering words of encouragement.</p>
<p>The United States has aviation police who have designated air routes. There are fixed routes to fly to any location. There are strict punishment regulations for flying on the wrong route, to prevent collisions and accidents.</p>
<p>American military aircraft often fly to the suburbs to practice dropping bombs, with a designated area on the ground. They drop bombs from high altitudes for practice. Every year, there is an airplane exhibition in Washington. That night, countless airplanes are decorated with electric lights, shining brightly in various colors. People from all over the country flock to see the spectacle, creating an extremely lively scene.</p>
<p>American airplanes are all equipped with airborne wireless telephones, and commercial airplanes can also listen to music. The sound is very clear through the two tightly fitted earcups. There are also weather stations in various locations specifically established for aviation.</p>
<p>American women are adventurous. In the hot summer, they often climb onto the wings of airplanes to cool off. This might be seen as a strange tale in China, but it is common in America.</p>
<p>The American government currently has a reward for "whoever can invent an airplane with the speed and force of a gun or cannon, traveling in a straight line, arriving in an instant." But it is unknown when this will be realized.</p>
<p>As I was saying goodbye and leaving, Mr. Huang Jingwan told me on the way, "Miss Wang's courtesy name is Canzhi. She loves martial arts and is skilled in boxing and sword dancing. When Americans have gatherings in America, they often invite her to perform, bringing honor to Chinese women. Miss Wang is resolute, brave, and revolutionary. She is good at drinking and can drink three or four catties of yellow wine without getting drunk. She is filial. After returning to China a few days ago, she immediately went to West Lake to mourn her deceased mother's grave." I am recording this here to let people know Miss Wang's character.</p>

<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>"The first line, isn't it 'Have you been well since we parted?' I've removed the word 'parted' and replaced it with 'separated.' 'Have you been well since we separated?' Isn't that more elegant?"</p>
<p>"Extremely elegant! Thank you! Please go downstairs! You've been disturbing me so much that I can't do anything. At this moment, you might as well do it for me."</p>
<p>The lady listened and, without saying a word, walked to the door, stood there for a while, and then said:</p>
<p>"I won't come up, and you won't come down, okay?"</p>
<p>Ziliang immediately started writing, ignoring her. She finally went downstairs. Ziliang calmed down and had only revised half of the piece when he heard the lady downstairs calling again.</p>
<p>"Ziliang!"</p>
<p>How could Ziliang dare to answer? If he answered, she would definitely come up. So he remained silent.</p>
<p>"Ziliang! Come down!"</p>
<p>Ziliang thought: That's not good! Could it be that she's calling me down for dinner? This morning, she called me down for porridge. If I didn't go down, she would eat all the porridge. If it's time for dinner now, if I don't answer, I'm afraid I won't get any food again. So I have to ask her clearly.</p>
<p>"Ziliang! Are you coming down or not?"</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>The lady didn't answer. Ziliang only heard a series of clanging sounds from below. It turned out that the lady was knocking on the rice bowl with chopsticks. This was clearly a signal for dinner. How ridiculous! She actually treated me like a cat or a dog. Ziliang didn't have time to think it over and immediately put down his pen:</p>
<p>"Is it dinner?"</p>
<p>There was no answer from below.</p>
<p>Ziliang went downstairs and saw that the lady had indeed started eating first.</p>
<p>"I asked you, why didn't you answer?"</p>
<p>"How can I talk with a mouthful of food?"</p>
<p>Ziliang saw two bowls of yellowish rice and three bowls of vegetables on the table. Looking closely, he couldn't help but get angry again:</p>
<p>"How annoying! Why is it always soybean sprouts! Is there no other vegetable besides soybean sprouts?"</p>
<p>He hesitated to eat.</p>
<p>"Soybean sprouts, I just asked you about them, and you said it was good, so I bought them!"</p>
<p>"When did you ask me?"</p>
<p>"I said, 'Stir-fried silverfish with kidney, is that okay?' You said yes. Stir-fried silverfish with kidney is another name for soybean sprouts!"</p>
