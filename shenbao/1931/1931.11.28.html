<p>（巴黎）　今午白里安起草决議案完畢後、中國施總代表即於十二時十五分造訪、通知錦州方面驚人消息、謂該處中國軍隊現有被日軍進攻之虞、並請白里安注意英國軍事觀察家之報告、證明日本所指華軍五萬集中錦州之說、完全不確顯係杜撰、俾爲日軍進攻藉口、據英代表報告理事會、指英軍事觀察家星期三下午報告錦州局勢如常、未見華軍有準備進攻之象、亦未見中國當道有派兵出關之象、該處中國軍隊司令否認集中軍隊於通遼、渠固料日軍不久將到錦州、但顯似未作防禦準備、錦州華軍有步兵三旅砲兵一旅等共二萬三千人、但山海關亦駐有東北第九旅扼守榆　之間、據錦州司令部報告、日軍已於星期三佔據新民、刻正有一千四百人續向西南方進發、又日水兵一百人未携武裝、在山海關登岸云云、國聯中人信目下中立觀察家方在錦州、足以減少日軍攻擊之虞、但亦不完全贊成中國所稱錦州恐有戰事之說、以爲日本業向國聯保證、苟無挑釁舉動、日軍不再進攻、惟日將吏對於勦匪必須有行動之自由、故料日來當不致以無謂之進攻、危及巴黎談判使世界及理事會不直日人之所爲、雖然國聯中人聞日軍一千四百人向新民西進之報、亦甚覺不安、白里安準備於必要時、以更强硬之牒文警告、防免錦州衝突、據稱、白氏曾私向施肇基保證、渠已得日代表最正式宣告、日軍不佔領錦州、惟英法雖接有此種消息、乃近數日間日軍續續西進、故國聯中人聲稱、渠輩必須接受芳澤之聲明、認爲日政府正式保證、今若日軍果侵犯錦州、則世界輿論行將有絕大多數贊成理事會採取最厲行動、撤回五十四國駐日使節而提出其他制裁、並邀美國參加以厚實力云、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　國聯理事會解决滿洲問題之决議草案、自經提出後中國方面尙未有覆文送達、惟中國總代表施肇基曾向白里安表示、中國有數項意見、願理事會將該數點加入該會最後之决議案中、據云施氏之意、恐中國堅持成見、理事會對於調查工作、將無由進行、故中國方面頗願使决議草案、適合乎討論之根據、庶理事會得有廻旋之餘地云、日本方面聞已有答復、由日本代表芳澤送達白里安、芳澤於今日下午三時曾與理事會會長白里安晤面、日本之答復、係於接受該决議草案之外加修正文保留將來日本軍隊自滿洲中國境内退入鐵路區域時、得爲自衛之行動、再則日本對於派遣中立調查委員團事件、亦有一小保留案提出、（二十六日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　國聯行政會今日午後四時一刻舉行非公開之會議、指定法國白里安·英國薛西爾西班牙國瑪達利加·三人爲委員、另行草擬行政會議案之第二節即關於指派英員團赴滿調查一事　中日兩國皆未列度、路透社探悉在開會前施博士告白里安、渠在原則上不反對行政會之提案、但渠不能不提出錦州問題及制止日軍前進之必要、渠欲得關於日政府必尊重此議案中擔任之保證、渠主張擴大國聯視察員之權力、尤望將其報告儘速公佈、聞施博士與白里安討論時、殆已接受行政會議案、但尙未發出接受此案之正式通告、行政會今日午後之會議　歷一小時又五分、五時二十分休會今晨將再集議、届時或可收到關於中國接受此案之切實復文、大約星期六日當可舉行公開會議、聞白里安在午後集會時告行政會會員、日本在原則上不反對設立中立區域、行政會乃决定授權與各使署所派往錦州之軍事參贊、向雙方司令就地談判設立中立區域之條欵、聞白里安指日本對於行政會議案之態度爲默認、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　行政會會員除中日代表外、今日午後互換意見、以期協定昨已通知各報之草案大意、已推定起草委員會、明晨十時半開會、議長接到關於錦州附近事態之中日來文後、已與行政會同人商榷可襄助防免衝突危險之辦法云、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　中代表施博士今日以中國發來之情報兩起送交國聯秘書處、一稱日軍於十一月二十五日佔據新民、日司令將新民知事拘禁商會内、一係中國十一月二十五日致日本之文、否認中國將大批生力軍集中於錦州之說、並聲明錦州成新民如有不幸事件發生、日本必須負責、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　某要人與行政院相接近、本日午後語本社記者、行政院所擬解决方案、尙屬良好、緣調查委員團之在遠東、無異將國際監察逐日加以肯定、該委員團就地監視毫不間斷、對於撤兵一層、自必在精神上連續施以壓迫、促其實行、又云日本接受委員團、似由於美國堅决要求所致、九月間該國對於此事不願聞問、茲旣贊成、則所處地位上、各項主要點之中業已抛棄其三、（一）滿洲事不容第三者出而干涉（二）五項基本原則、（三）直接交涉、此種見解皆已無形消滅、華盛頓九國會議</p>

<p>極其嚴重之新局面。今已在日人有計劃的行爲之下展開。一爲天津重起重大之騷亂。一爲日軍出動進迫錦州。攻錦擾津。爲日人有計劃有步驟之發動爲决心向我國挑戰之積極表現。世界人士應有目共見。</p>
<p>據最近所得電訊。天津日軍。正轟擊我肅淸亂徒之警察。以哀的美敦書之形式。逼我保安隊解除武。裝並撤退至距鐵路二華里以外。津市附近。交通均斷。日軍戰艦羣集。日閣議且决議增兵。又遼河日軍。亦已一律動員。沿北寗路向錦州出動準備正式攻擊。白旗堡已被佔踞。饒陽河亦被擾及。事態已愈趨於嚴重矣。</p>
<p>日人一方面以武力步步進展。一方面則在巴黎多方諱飾。日表白其無以武力奪取錦州及其他各地之心事。又恐用兵之事實。不能掩蔽。則又反言張學良軍隊集中锦州。謀反攻日軍天津華警攻擊日租界。彈落其界内。此種顚倒是非。與事實絕對相反之論。應爲無論何人所不信乃國聯方面假作痴聾。非特不對日本稍加抑制反對中國盡力脅迫。不顧犧牲公理犧牲盟約。犧牲中國。以博取苟安一時之僞和平。以緩和當前之危局。東北調杳團之計議。日本撤兵之無限期。純爲日方意旨而亦强我以必從。我國亦已最後退讓。至願劃錦州爲中立地。以防遏危機之繼續擴大。然而錦州與天津方面之情勢。仍如此緊急。日人之迫我國家至忍無可忍讓無可讓之地步。决意引起遠東之戰禍。蓋已昭然若揭。於此吾人不得不認國聯爲故意縱亂爲有意的坐看日人破壤世界和平</p>
<p>天津變亂一再爆發變亂之作。不自英法租界而獨自日租界。英法駐軍都無任何動作。獨日軍公然向我保安警察轟擊阻撓我之靖亂工作誰爲變亂之發縱指使者蓋絕非狡辯所可掩飾。天津旣已發動。錦州亦遂開始進迫。其目的蓋無非在於不撤兵與澈底暴露國聯之軟弱無力。在武裝佔領之下。完成東北獨立運動。以發揮其帝國主義之野心。國聯處此。究將何以自解我國人又將何以自救。</p>

<p>國聯有重要决定</p>
<p>我政府接受辦理</p>
<p>日官塲態度一斑</p>
<p>（南京）　外部二十七日公布、錦州安全問題、自中國提出國聯行政院後、數日來迭經討論、至昨日該院已護有重要之决定、即要求聯盟派遣視察員至錦州之各重要國家、向各該國之視察員、發下列之訓令、（一）各該視察人員應彼此互相商量、以研究中華軍與日軍之間、是否有建立一中立區域之可能、或更有他法以避免兩軍之衝突、（二）彼等應與華日兩軍之將領彼此聯絡、以便爲必須之措置、行政院並以爲欲使是項致駐錦華軍長官之訓令、得有預備之結果、則應由中日兩方政府、切令各該國駐軍長官、與各該外國視察員彼此聯絡接洽、行政院方面已由其議長白里安、簽　公文將上述二點、請求中日兩政府注意、中國政府爲切實遵行和平與和緩之政策起見、已接受此項提議、並正將必要之訓令、電知駐錦華軍長官、告以行政院之决令並令其與各該已經　派之外國觀察員、聯絡接洽、注意行政院此項保持和平防免形勢更增嚴重之舉動、至於能否生效、則全視日本對此事之態度如何耳、關於上項消息、國府某要人發表談話如下、上星期二、國府對東省日軍司令部準備進攻錦州所造成之危局、已非正式通知國聯行政院、同日國府得悉日政府已向國聯行政院保證、錦州一時尙無被攻危險、當時英法德各國視察員、已抵錦、均證明中國並未向錦州集中、亦無援軍由關内開出事、星期三、國府接到各方報告稱、日方有軍事行動、中國政府當即向國聯行政院、正式提出緊急提案、主張立即設立區域、在中立國軍事視察員監視下、中日雙方軍隊、皆不得通過、行政院於星期召集緊急會議、當即議决、由已派視察員至錦州之各會員國、訓令各該國武官、立即進行下列數項、（一）立即擬定設立中立區或劃界之計劃、以阻中日軍隊衝突、（二）立即通知中日雙方軍隊長官、請遵守此種辦法、現中國政府已訓令錦州駐軍、遵照辦理、並已需知巴黎中國接受此種辦法、是國聯行政院對中國政　提出之確實警告、已全部接受且立予以制止、足證行政院及各會員國、俱有令行政院議决案實施履行之决心、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>（東京）　法大使瑪戴爾今日通知幣原外相謂張學良已向北平法使聲明、準備將錦州　兵澈至關内、並準備設立中立區域民政與警務、由中國當道辦理云日官塲評論此議、謂華軍之撤退、與中立區域之設立定可使時局大爲和緩、但警務問題、須由雙方地方當道協定云云、日政府　將答覆法大使、告以日本歡迎張學良撤退　錦州軍隊與設立　中立區域之提議、　　警務與行政問題須由該處中日當道協定之、無須外人干涉、聞覆文並聲明如天津事態不再嚴重、　而不有急派援軍西進之必要、則日本允不入錦州以西之中立區域、如天津情勢惡化、則日本保留由滿洲派兵經鐵路穿過中立區域之權、因此路進兵、最爲迅速也、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>錦州　日人雖屢傳錦州方面衝突即將發作之報告、然此問事態並不若是之嚴重、此乃觀於由瀋移此東三省政府諸人之迄未離城而可知者、此處政府、乃東三省之合法政府、餘者爲獨立軍人、亦即日本傀儡所設者、錦州附近之華軍、現沿大凌河據地以守、距瀋陽三十哩之新民屯昨夜爲日軍所佔、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　官塲稱、如日軍進攻錦州、果爲事實、則日政府不得不辭職、蓋軍人此舉、不啻謂滿洲軍人不受政府節制也、星期三日軍人曾與政府約定、不作獨立　動、因了解日軍驅逐華兵入關之舉、將引起危險糾紛也、並約定縱使時局發展、在日軍司令視之、認爲有以攻爲守之必要然亦必先得政府　意而後進攻是以報紙雖有大規模軍事行動現已開始之說、外務省仍信日軍無攻擊錦州之意、並信滿洲現有兵力、不足以作此大舉、（二十七日路透電）</p>

<p>「從「餓」到「死」這個過程很簡單。先是身體發軟，還能微聲的說話。再進一步便不能說話了。但是兩脚還能夠動。到了這個程度，如果是安然睡着不動，還可延長相當時日之殘喘。假使有個不懂事的兒子或女兒在旁邊哭着要飯吃，或是不忍看兒女們同樣的挨餓，而意圖扒往别處要點東西給兒女吃，那末，他一勞動，嘴裏便有一股黃水流將出來，身體也就隨着這股黃水落在地上，永遠不動彈了。每個餓死的人都免不了要冒這股黃水；每個因餓而冒黃水的人都不免立刻倒斃。黃水啊，它永遠印在我的腦筋中！」</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>黨國要人吳稚暉先生。脫略形跡。玩世不恭。其道義與風趣。俱爲常人所不及。洵民國時代之東方曼倩也。先生崇樸儉。不衫不履　步行通衢。猶憶今夏某晚。予曾見其緩步南京路上。狀殊閒逸。蓋飯後外出疏散也。忽路左有二三跳盪少年。亦識先生　目者。怪聲戲呼吳稚暉者再。先生聞聲。疑爲狂暴之徒。或有不利於已也。立趨入某果餌肆。藉購食物以避之。明哲保身。理當然也。嗜閱小報。及各報附鋟。常就報攤選購之。早年亦喜爲小說家言。上下古今談一書。即以小說體裁。演述科學原理之巨著也。擅作楹帖。求之者謙素邱積。先生苦之。嘗自稱已書爲狗扑爪貓脚跡。有污白紙。其詼諧謙　有如此。此次倭人肆暴。先生尤憤懣塡膺。客有知其軼事者。謂曩歲先生旅倭。曾親受倭人之悔辱。酒酣耳熱。輒自道之。時爲前淸光緒二十八年。（倭明治三十五年）先生與孫君撥均。因力請公使送學生肄業官立學校。遭當局之忌怒。倭之警察署。乃將先生與孫君遞解回籍以辱之。先生旣被逮。以爲士可殺。不可辱。欲以一死喚醒羣夢。遂於警吏拘引出境之際。投河從屈大夫游。幸遇援得甦。友人有於其衣中檢獲一函。封面上題有「其言也善」四字。内一書云。「信之以死。明不作賊。民權自由。建邦天則。削髮維新。片言可决。以尸爲諫。懷憂曲突。唏噓悲哉。公使何與。孔曰成仁。孟曰取義。亡國之慘。將有如是。諸公努力。僕終不死。」言辭激昻慷慨。足與宋文文山之正氣歌。同爲千古彪炳也。</p>
<h3 id="c96">記所見之海外時事揷畫 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>暴日侵略我東三省。强佔土地。屠殺國人。情形嚴重。爲全世界所震駭。因此歐美寄來之雜誌。每多談及中日事件。亦有若干揷畫。隱具諷剌者。翻閱所得。聊述一二。藉見海外人士對於日人武力併呑之觀察。頗多不同也。</p>
<p>上月份之英國婦女雜誌。繪有一幅揷畫。並立者爲一東洋男子及一中國女子。宛如夫婦之相爭。中間小孩。則書有南滿鐵路字樣。作掩面而泣之狀。至立於中國女子之後者。尙有一婦人。指俄國也。隱示袒助之意。畫之顯示如此。其是否合理。閱者殆能察之。蓋暴日此次興兵。並非爲南滿鐵路。實際上直欲以武力併呑我國耳。我國上下一心。同仇敵愾。公理尙存。終必有戰勝之一日。無須有俄國之助。且俄國亦未必能助我也。若謂東三省事件。可擬之爲夫婦之爭。而視南滿鐵路爲雙方間之小孩。更覺於事實情理。不能恰合者矣。</p>
<p>美國之鏡報。近亦刋有揷畫。作兩個小孩子爭欲以火燃放爆竹之狀。爆竹之上。標以世界大戰。美國人固已深知東三省事件不能圓滿解决。將有引起世界大戰之可能性。但亦知此可怕之爆竹。我國並未欲放。且竭力避免其燃放乎。即不幸而劈拍一聲。斯乃日人以火引之耳。故謂中國人與日本人爭放世界大戰之爆竹。無寗謂日人獨放之較爲合理也。</p>

<p>— 王俊芳女士</p>
<p>憶昔年在友人處閱瘦鵑先生所著之紫羅蘭花片小册。内有一文叙台灣英雄簡大獅抗日經過。英勇偉烈。足以激發吾人爲國奮鬥之精神者良多。茲將記憶所及。　述於次。以勵國人。</p>
<p>甲午之戰。吾國爲日所敗。日本欲得東北三省。經李鴻章力抗未果。終割台灣以和。當時台人聞之。羣起反對。迭向淸庭呼籲而無效。台灣巨族簡姓中有大獅其人者。讀書無多。而賦性尙俠。頗得衆心。聞淸庭將交割台灣。憤然起曰。是不可以力抗衡耶。平時囂囂好上人。臨事而懼。非丈夫也。聞其言者。皆爲感動。起而團結。誓死拒日。大獅遂號召死黨。與黑旗軍劉永福合。積極備戰。日艦來犯。觸水雷而喪。死水兵數十。台人歡呼震天。日盡調全國四十餘鐵甲巡洋艦。復大至圍攻。大獅率丁壯苦戰。驅婦女耕作。困守經年。糧不匱乏。後以彈藥不繼。携欵渡閩。購置軍備補充。但多爲日所擄。或爲中國官吏縛送日艦媚敵。於是困守乏術。守至十月八月之後而台陷。然猶巷戰數日。力盡援絕。始微服奔閩。思謀再舉。不幸爲友所賣。閩官縛之送台。日人施以極刑。行刑時台人空巷往觀。目見其抗日領袖腸流血飛。衆皆低頭飲泣。不忍卒覩。自後台人遂抛去恢復故土之念而陷於奴隸生活。憶。大獅以台灣彈丸之地。抗日傾國之師。年餘不屈。台灣雖亡。不可謂無人矣。視之黃海之役。日以崇朝盡喪吾北洋艦隊。則尤足爲大獅豪焉。</p>
<p>短訊　書家張枕綠。痛馬占山將軍之孤軍失守。仍奮其儒生愛國之精神。自捐紙墨書聯。籌欵資其反攻。凡助欵士元或以上者。贈五尺聯一。北軍路良晨好友社經辦。印有宣言。警句如「鞠躬盡瘁。折腕何妨。揮毫　敵千人軍。集腋乃成堅壁壘」「看民心親德之僉同。作政府出兵之先導」云云。殊激昂慷慨。同情者諒不乏人也。</p>

<p>— 天疣</p>
<p>當馬關條約締結時。我國割臺灣於日本。臺灣民衆非常反對。乃組織共和國。推巡撫唐景崧爲總統。以拒日。那是有聲有色的一幕嘉劇。激昂慷慨的情形。寫得躍然如見。</p>
<p>城頭逢逢雷大鼓。「蒼天。蒼天。！！涙如雨。！！倭人竟割臺灣去。當初版圖入天府。天感遠及日出處。我高我曾我祖父。芟殺蓬蒿來此土。糖霜茗雪千億樹。歲課金錢無萬數。天胡棄我。天何怒。取我脂膏共仇虜。耽耽無厭彼碩鼠。民則何辜罹此苦。亡秦者誰。三户楚。何况閩粤百萬户。人人效死誓死拒。萬衆一心誰敢侮。成敗利鈍非所覩。」</p>
<p>一聲拔劍起擊柱。「今日之事無他語。有不從者手刄汝」。</p>
<p>堂堂藍旗立黃虎。傾城擁觀空巷舞。黃金斗大印繫組。直將總統呼巡撫。「今日之政民爲主。臺南臺北固吾圉。不誈雷池越一步。」</p>
<p>以上是五分鐘内的反日的熱烈情形。以下寫他的結果。</p>
<p>海城五月風怒號。飛來金翅三百艘。追逐鉅艦來如潮。前者上岸雄虎彪。後者奪關飛猿猱。村前之銃備前刀。當輒披靡血杵漂。神焦鬼爛城門燒。誰與戰守誰能逃。</p>
<p>一輪紅日當空高。千家白旗隨風飄。搢紳耆老相招邀。夾跪道旁俯折腰。紅纓竹冠盤錦絛。青絲辮髮垂雲髾。跪捧銀盤茶與糕。絲沈之瓜紫葡桃。「將軍遠來無乃勞。降民敬爲將軍犒。」　　將軍曰「來。呼汝曹。汝我同種原同胞。延平郡王人中豪。實闢此土來分茅。今日還我天師敎。國家仁聖如唐堯。撫汝育汝殊黎苗。安汝室家無譊譊。」</p>
<p>將軍徐行塵不囂。萬馬入城風蕭蕭。嗚呼將軍非天驕。王師威德無不包。我輩生死將軍操。敢不歸依明聖朝。」</p>
<p>當時以全中國對付日本。尙有甲午年之敗。以臺灣一省去反抗日本。原是一件極困難的事。但前日那樣熱烈。今日這奄奄無生氣的望風屈服。未免太難爲情了。所以公度感慨的收束道。</p>
<p>噫吁嚱。悲乎哉。汝全臺。昨何忠勇今何怯。萬事反覆隨轉睫。平時戰守無預備。曰忠曰義無所恃。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>但是他有些奇怪：現在天也夜得不多時候，約摸七八點鐘光景吧，怎麽打更的已經出來了呢？或者因爲目下時世不好，老早就戒嚴，在八九點鐘，就要斷絕行人，自然更夫要出來了。可是我聽上海是最安善的地方，所以内地一遇了亂事，大家都向上海奔，難道我難得到上海來的，又遇着戒嚴時期嗎？</p>
<p>他子細一看，更覺得不對了。爲什麽這些更夫，年紀都是輕的，還有年紀很輕而漂亮的女人在内，這當然只可稱之爲更婦，不能再呌伊爲更夫了。或者是老更夫已經打不動更，傳給了他的子女了嗎？敲更的更夫們，手中還握着一面小旗子，這倒是很新鮮的把戲咧。</p>
<p>他們從那邊桌子上，漸漸走到這邊桌子來了。</p>
<p>「旣然是敲更的，應該在馬路上毃，怎麽走到屋子裏來呢？」這是鄕下人更有些疑惑了。</p>
<p>他們走上前來，先向鄕下人鞠了一個躬，然後給了他一張傳單式的紙兒。那紙上很細密前許多字，鄕下人雖　也識幾個字，但是他却不敢看這傳單。不要看他是粗人，他却也粗中有細。他曾經有人告訴他：「上海的地方是最危險的。倘然在馬路上走時，人家給你一張紙，你切不可拿。因爲常有那種共產黨，反動派，在那裏散佈傳單。發傳單的人，他自己知道是危險品，急急的逃跑了。你接了他的傳單，還不知道傳單上所載的是什麽話？偵探見你手中拿着傳單，便把你拘去。聽說有一個鄕下來的人，他在馬路上走走，看見地下有一張報紙，他拾起來覺很乾凈，包包鞋子，很用得着。他便把一雙破鞋子，用那張報紙包了，走到火車站，便被警察扣留了，說你帶了違禁品。他想不出有什麽違禁品？誰知包那鞋子的那張報紙，是一張反動派的報紙，鄕下人弄也弄不淸楚什麽呌做反動派，可是官司是吃苦了。」在這種情况之下，因此人家把上海視爲一個陷人的深淵。</p>
<p>鄕下人現在見敲更的人，也散發那種傳單式的紙片，他想起了人家告訴他的故事，他再也不敢去看。</p>
<p>「老先生！我們都是學校裏的學生，出來勸募水災賑欵的，請你看被水的災民面上，捐幾個錢，不論多少，都是很好的。」兩個初募水災賑欵的學生，很宛轉的陳詞。</p>

<p>天陰米市轉定</p>
<p>南頭　昨日各帮到頭愈覺淸稀、浦存略有、城鄕店胃仍薄、因天時關係、新鮮貨進意略動、行胃亦覺稍開、因連日内地來電報告、申盤不願再跌、西新行情頂貨堅硬、普通亦暫定不動　早薄二稻到積不多、客胃及本城交易淸淡、行情帶疲、杜洋尖囤户雖有、惟數目有限、糯米受客元日疲、去化僅頂貨略動、宿次呆滯、形勢續萎、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日來貨約三十餘艘、因小雨早間臨市人數、不見十分踴躍、厚新粳定局、高貨尤穩、中次貨店胃活動、主客隨市脫售、薄稻需要尙好、提起近角、埠洋尖時斛時停、買户並不注重、價格續挺、變陰元隨到隨銷、行情高緊次定、杜尖胃淡、低落五分、</p>

<p>昨日洋米市况、已進於停頓狀態中、洋行雖有趁此金價下落時、兜售各月份期貨、但進户觀望、多日未有成交、現米自本街連日暢辦後、又有定貨抵申、故擬擯小再進、但貨主以成本昻大、不肯輕脫、且以目下現存並不十分湧塞、囤户亦有直接移進、市上浮存不多、一經大帮客化、市面立可轉機、故擬堅持擯守、以待善價而沽也、市面旣經雙方擯持、隨呈停頓之局矣、</p>

<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初疲繼俏、初因洋麥報價、徵小三四角、人心見平、旋因某小廠及大廠略補近期、及客帮抽購現貨、低軟之人心、遂見俏俐、計近月好一分半、遠期好一分、迨至下午開盤、以北方消息又轉險恶、客帮均有回出、更因金市重跌、勢頗不振、致大部份之人心、又趨不佳、觀銀根依然奇緊、時局又難樂觀、前途殊少過好之望也、結果本月份至三月份各小七厘半、四月份小五厘云、</p>

<p>邇來呢絨市面甚形萎頓、蓋走銷呆滯、貨價亦視前見疲、獨馬褲呢暢銷特甚、客方需要、絡繹不絕、市銷之暢達可見一斑、洋服舖售價每件在五十元左右、大路售盤、遂之見漲、孔士魯麟好華永記等牌、每碼一律上漲二三錢、昨孔士魯麟貨均喊售七兩五錢半　永記七兩一錢半、好華爲六兩五六錢云、</p>

<p>日來雨衣布趨勢異常呆滯、厚薄貨售價皆疲。蓋買方進胃甚淡、而新定下者進本輕賤、下月份又有到貨、以致供過於求、執貨者極願削價求售然客方亦非急需候銷者、多不欲再爲續購、故市盤步步下疲、昨各牌單面開水美厚雨衣布一律減售至四兩七錢、元常藍灰象皮銀格子薄雨衣布、俱減售三兩一錢二分五厘、</p>

<p>出口情形　本市現洋、係由杭州造幣廠承鑄、每天爲三十六萬元、歸中國交通等銀行承包、連日銀根奇緊、如二十六日市面、上下午洋厘、距離相差二厘多、平時僅二毫半之差、原因爲連日大批現洋出口、而大條進口、較前略减、如一萬現洋出口、華商匯兌字號、可獲利數百元、銀行錢莊可獲四五十元、因此日人以厚利引誘華商、吸收現洋、爲避人耳目計、均先行運往天津靑島烟台後、再行設法轉運大連、至東三省、少數華商、爲貪圖微利、未悉其奸、致入彀中、若不早日覺悟、則將來本市直接受現洋缺乏之恐慌、間接國内金融市場、爲之搗亂、至日人吸收目的、係以現洋在東三省曁各地、爲誘惑土匪肇事之用云、</p>

<p>秦潤卿談　新聲社記者昨往訪錢業公會主席秦潤卿、叩以對於大批現洋出口之意見、據云、現洋出口、爲銀錢業極普通之正當營業、况此次之運往天津靑島烟臺之現洋、純爲該地華商承購、目的莫非爲調劑金融、决無其他作用、因自天津事變後、人心恐慌、深恐紙幣發生問題、多樂貯現洋、以防萬一、如果日人要吸收現洋、儘可由本市日商銀行運出、無須轉手於華人云、</p>
<p>林康侯談　新聲社記者、昨又往訪銀行回業公會秘書長林康侯、叩以現洋出口之意見、據云、自天津事變發生後、津市金融起恐慌、本市銀行界、爲調劑起見、於上星期間、曾運赴天津中國銀行三百餘萬元、交通銀行一百餘萬元、曁其他各銀行、共約計五百萬元、並無其他作用、况禁止現洋出口、事實上不易辦到、例如此次各界匯欵犒賞馬占山將軍、約有百萬左右、均由滬地各銀行匯往哈爾濱、同時須以現洋連出、以資調劑、否則哈埠金融勢必發生恐慌、至一部份富有財力者、向滬地提出存欵、匯往天津、再轉大連換金洋存銀行、事實上亦容或有之、今接市商會函復、銀行公會已定於明日下午二時本會常會時、提出詳細討論矣耯</p>

<p>歐亞航空公司主任李景樅、前赴北平、籌備西北航線、現已就緒、已於前晚返滬、新聲社記者昨訪李氏於公司中、詢以西北航線一切　李談頗詳、謂已定下月十日試航　明年三月間、或可正式飛航、届時歐亞線（即上海至德柏林）亦可由西北線直達、不繞道於滿洲里更爲便利、茲誌其談話於下、</p>
<p>籌備經過　李氏談籌備經過計分三點、（一）關於氣候上之調查、因西北天氣嚴寒、故曾預備於機件上裝置禦寒器具、在國歷一二兩月、十分寒冷、頗難飛行、其餘時期、尙無大碍（二）關於汽油之運輸、汽油一項、爲飛行之最要品、現汽油已决定由北平運往各站、至迪化站之機油、則因該地鄰近俄國、故向俄方購買、（三）關於機件上之設備、如禦寒具及機内飲料然料等、均已獲極妥善之辦法、</p>
<p>勘定機站　關於機站之設置問題、現已勘定、自北平至迪化、共有五站、即北平、（河北）柏林廟、（綏遠）弱水河、（寗夏）哈密、（新疆）迪化、（新疆）共經過四省地界、相距計一千七百餘公哩、合華里三千餘里、外傳須經過熱河等省均不確、因此五站、爲自平至迪之最捷途徑也、</p>
<p>試航確期　試航日期、自經籌備完畢後、現已確定下月十日、此次與史密德在京籌備、凡兩星期餘、現難來滬、仍須於本月底下月初赴平、主持試航事宜、因再遷延、則嚴冬立届、更感不　、致正式飛航、須於試航後始可確定、惟大約須在國歷明年二三月間云、</p>
<p>飛機問題　至駕駛西北線之飛機、因該公司飛機頗多、擬不向外國再購、此次試航之飛機、則係最新式之榮極司機Ｗ卅三號、</p>
<p>歐亞捷徑　該公司籌辦之歐亞線自上海至德國柏林、其間須經過國内之京平·林西·滿洲里、及俄國之伊爾庫司克·莫斯科·等、始得到達柏林、前因飛機誤入外蒙被扣、迄今尙求發還、致飛航中止、現又因車北被日强佔、更無復航希望、損失之鉅、殆不可計、如西北線通航後、則滬柏線可假道西北、不經過林西滿洲里等處、逕可由滬至平至迪、越俄境而至柏林、較前迅捷多多、自北平至迪化、行程二月餘、現西北線成立祗須十二小時内、飛機即可到達云、</p>

<p>歐戰日記　·顧·昻·若·譯</p>
<p>那天午後、凡爾賽會議繼續研究休戰條約、並决定加入俄國前綫的條件、</p>
<p>十一月二日午後、凡爾賽又有一次集會、討論海軍條件和俄綫條文、</p>
<p>同時、奥軍最高司令從狄愛斯將軍方面接到協約國所提出的休戰條文、維出納政府的態度什麽樣、接受呢還是拒絕呢、如其接受、那末匃奥的分裂是否足以履行條件、協約當局對此問題頗費躊躇、那天午後、勞合喬治君因此不能不把德戰艦交出的要求放棄一大部分、</p>
<p>維也納政府屈服了之後、他又立即重把海軍條件全部提出、他要求德戰艦解除武裝和交出多艘軍艦潛水艇、條件甚苛、德軍必難接受、陸軍休戰條文因亦不能簽字、</p>
<p>我請協約政府注意繼續流血的責任、協約政府遂囑我把海軍條件列入休戰條文、那末、敵方假使對於海軍條件不能接受、我們便可加以修正、</p>
<p>實則德軍一切都接受了、</p>
<p>俄線和羅馬尼亞前線的條件未加討論也接受了、關於這點、法國外交部長畢勛提出波蘭復國問題、這爲聯軍作戰目的之一、但這問題决定不同休戰問題相提並論、現在祗袂定要求東部德軍撤退至一九一四時原狀、</p>
<p>十一月四日、具體休戰條文在凡爾賽會議最後一讀通過、協約政府領袖遂即電告威爾遜總統、並决定由我會同英海軍司令向德政府全權代表提出這條文、負責談判、</p>
<p>這條文通告華盛頓的時候、協約政府英國之特請遂把威爾遜總統十四點中之海洋自由的原則加以保留、</p>
<p>我向前線將士下令、准許德代表通過防線前來談判、一面警告各軍嚴防謠言、</p>
<p>十一月六日夜半十二時三十分、我接到德軍最高司令第一次無線電、通知柏林政府特派全權姓名、並請指定會見地點、和可否於德代表到達聯軍防綫時暫行停戰、</p>
<p>我立即簡單答覆道、「德國全權如欲會見福煦元帥請求休戰、可逕至法軍某處防綫、守兵已奉令迎往會見地點、」</p>
<p>七日晨、我得悉德國全權將於中午自斯巴啓程、下午四五時之間可到法軍防綫、法德兩軍準備在德代表團通過火綫時停戰、</p>
<p>我偕韋肯參謀長和總　部軍官三人、會同英海軍代表、下午五時自聖里乘專車出發、往勒松特站附近孔碑森林裏會見德國全權代表、</p>
<p>德代表團因德軍防區路途阻塞、遲至下午九時始到法軍防綫、及至目的地已遲了十二小時、十一月八日上午七時始到會面地點、</p>
<p>上午九時在法國火車公事車裏舉行第一次談判、</p>
<p>休戰條約簽字後、我把協約和德全權之勒松特會議經過詳情報告法總統和總理、（註·一九一八年十一月八日、德代表到後即開始談判、協約方面代表爲福煦元帥·韋肯參謀長·英海軍司令韋密斯·和霍普·及英海軍大佐瑪里、德方代表爲愛慈巴格·活朋道夫·溫特佛將軍·海軍大佐萬斯樂·蓋洽爾大佐·和黑爾道大佐、談判三天之久、德方竭力設法減輕福煦的條件、德代表團與柏林用無綫電再往互磋商、一九一八年十一月十一晨二時零五分、德代表團通知福煦、準備簽字、上午二時十五分舉行最後一次會議、韋肯參謀長宣讀休戰條文、上午五時零五分條文繕正、五時十分簽字、德代表退、福煦聯帥即以無綫無向全綫下令十一時停戰、）</p>
<p>十一月十一日上午十一時聯軍全綫停戰、大戰五十三星期、砲火現歸岑寂、世界始有重見和平之望、</p>
<p>翌日、我向聯軍發出祝捷文如下、</p>
<p>聯軍將士、</p>
<p>你們苦戰數月擊退敵軍、繼以百折不撓的精神和勇往直前毅力向敵進攻、</p>
<p>你們得勝了歷史上　最大的戰爭、拯救了最神聖的主義、世界的自由、</p>
<p>論功行賞、你們亦足自豪了、</p>
<p>你們獲得了不朽的光榮和萬世的歌頌、</p>
<p>聯軍總司令福煦、（未完）</p>

<p>英國狄更生著　梁遇春譯</p>
<p>第一個意思、是批評坎替魯布的思想、不能一成不變的硬化、他拿古代的學說來做徵引、「······社會好比是大風琴、可是只能彈出一種簡單的諧音、立法者的職務就是調整那風琴、使牠能夠正確地彈出那個音調、所以如果柏拉圖能夠隨着他的主意做去、他那個大規模的普遍諧音、（生產者、兵士同哲學家的大諧和）會社人們一切聚居的地方、單調地死板地一直彈到現在、柏拉圖所想的諧音自然是很美妙的、但是他所鎭壓下去的那些不調洽的聲音、却一天一天的音浪增高、從他在世時到現在、不斷的在時間的迴音穹窿裏嘈雜地響着、我常常以爲這些不協調聲音裏包含有比他所想像到的任何一諧音都要來得更尊嚴的一個大和諧、而且那一陣的雜音巧妙的織成一曲宇宙大合奏樂、太玄妙了、我們僅僅能夠了解一小小部分、只有天神們纖塵不沾的智慧纔能夠所欣賞、」他說、「一切理想的政體的根本毛病、在於無論那個政體是多麽完善、也不過只能適用於當時那一種的情形、······可是當時那一種情形應當僅僅是人類歷史裏面暫時短促的過程、不該這麽不變地的繼續存在丨丨至於只把目前的政體僵化起來、奉爲至寳、絲毫没有加理想分子進去、那流弊的地方是更用不着說了、」</p>
<p>他以爲宇宙的大系、包羅萬有的自</p>
<p>跟着自然的進化而變動、這是自然間不可逃避的法則、如果加以一成不變的限制、反阻碍自然的進化、所以自由主義的政治理想、是不顧一切的放任政策、末節他說、「我們放任的是人民······我相信得過人的······若使我信不過他們、呌我去相信什麽呢、</p>
<p>第二個意思、是說明自由貿易的原理、他以爲這也是宇宙内自然的事實、他說、「我敢說在人類一切的活動裏、最顯明出於上帝的意思的、是這出產品的互換、······我要說自由政策實行後所產生的現在情形、可以證明自由政策的好處、······我相信不久别的國家也會覺醒起來、看淸自己的利益、定下關於經濟的新法律、來和我們競爭、結果大家都得到好處、我看地球上各國快要放下政治上的仇恨、結合起來、只做商業上的和平競爭、大砲的隆隆停住了、只聽到紡機低柔軋軋的聲音、······人類再不會再在戰塲上會晤、却是靠着他們選定的代表、像我們最偉大的詩人所說的、在「人類的議院、世界的大同盟裏相見、」</p>
<p>他的詞令是非常的純鍊淸醒、推理論斷、也合拍而緊輳、絕對使人覺得無懈可擊、</p>
<p>第三個發言是門多薩、他是現任保守黨的領袖、是林門漢姆、當前的大政敵、他的議論是異常的冷雋而且俏拔、他反對林門漢姆的自由主義、他以爲自由絕對不能無限制的、要維持社會的平衡、少不得要有許多干涉的力量、並且拿警察來做例子、</p>
<p>他開口第一句話、就使林門漢姆難堪、他說、「一個没有直接聽到上帝的訓話的特權的人、······」在一句話内面、就能反映出林門漢姆所說的、以成了非事實的笑話了、他舉的實例是</p>
<p>「舉個例罷、想一想警察這個制度、······靠着警察、弱的可以管理强的、少數的可以管理多數的、靠着他、許多在生存競爭裏應當要消滅的人們居然活着、······婚姻制度緊緊地牽着他的衣邊、私產制度跑到他懷中安安靜靜地伏着、</p>
<p>「······若使自由并没有什麽權威保證着、只就自由本身而論、那麽自由和混亂又有什麽分别呢、若使不是用相當的干涉成分之有無、來判别自由與混亂、我們又有什麽旁的分别呢、倘然承認了這個干涉成分有無的分别、我們豈不是要從放口預言的山頂走下、走到政治妥洽的枯癢平原去嗎、」</p>
<p>次則叙明保守黨的政見、他說、「我們所注意的不是全人類、是英國人、不是理想的政體、是英國的憲法、不是什麽政治經濟學、是我們商業實際狀况、在這事實的大森林内、佈滿了新舊的亂草、俗世的懈樹、肥大的灌木、和美麗的爬籐、我們總是順着舊路、心中惴惴地一步步慢慢走、努力使那些舊路不致於閉塞、不大敢去開闢新路徑、非是眞眞明白了新路會帶到目的地、絕不肯把好好的樹木斫下、去做一條新路、」</p>
<p>復次是叙述他對於對外貿易及世界聯盟的意見、均與林門漢姆、立在相反的地位、而確有他獨到的見解、他說、「他在幻想裏看到一個由商業帶來的大家互有好意的和平時期、他以爲靠着上帝莫明其妙的手段、貪婪和競爭會帮助我們達到仁愛同和平的目的、但是這點我又不能跟他去大胆地空想、······或者抱着希望地前瞻那水晶宫式的大幸福時代、······我以爲將來是包含了許多戰爭同戰爭的謠言、我們英國因爲他富强和空前的成功、特别會做全歐人民妒忌怨恨的目標、他們向外面四望、想替那數目天天增大的人民找塊移殖的地方、只見得大地上到處都給英國人先佔了、總是英國國旗飄揚着、這是英國最大的危險、可是我由這點抓到我國將來唯一的希望、英國的疆土、不僅僅是那三島、······我相信我們的殖民地不偈會像熟了的果子樣的離開我們自己落去、我們的附屬地不至於墜到别個主人手裏、遲早英國總會覺醒起來、了解她那大帝國的使命、隔海萬里的英國人會和我同心一意、因此我所預料的大聯盟不是人類的聯盟、而是世界裏英國人民的大聯盟、」</p>
<p>他的思想、很可以代表一般英人、帝國主義的思想、</p>
<p>第四個發言的是亞力遜、他是個溫和社會主義者、而是對於兩黨一個有力的批評家、</p>
<p>他先對林門漢姆與門多薩兩個人的意見、略一批評、次述明他所主張的社會主義的理論、他以爲「自然」是毫無規則的混亂狀態、凡是文化都含有拘束這個意義、社會主義當然也是拘束、社會主義是革命的、自由主義若不是句空話、也應該是革命的、革命并不含有暴動的行爲、暴動的行爲、只是革命的流產、社會主義的意義、就是增加社會組織的效能、對於政治的權力應該擴大、現在人民不相信政府、是由於現在的政府是爲特殊階級謀利益的機關、社會主義、要以平民的廉潔的政府、代替貪官汚吏的政府、組織社會、應該注重新倫理新習惯新宗敎的養成、社會主義唯一的根本信條、是人類進步、全靠「征服」、自然、同科學是人們「征服、自然是唯一武器、</p>
<p>最後述明他信仰的態度、他說、「我們可以說是和宇宙力合作、······因爲事情的演變自然而然會走到我們所希望的那個地步、······就是我們停漿不泛、我們的船還是前進、倘然我們暫時被阻住了、那障碍我們船的進行的潮流只屬於一兩個特别地方的、不是整個流水的趨向、在一切政治家内、只有我們有信仰、但是我們的信仰是安在科學上的、所以是個永久不能搖動的信仰、」</p>
<p>由他這一來、談話的趨向、遂由政見而轉變爲社會主義的討論了、</p>

<p>Two Trains of Japanese Soldiers Arrive at Baiqibao</p>
<p>Bridge No. 36 at Raoyang River Destroyed</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Inspect Jinzhou Area</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a telegram from Jinzhou, a train of Japanese armored cars and two trains of soldiers departed Xinmin at 8:20 AM on the 27th, heading towards Raoyang River. Our armored train, Zhongshan, blocked the Japanese train's advance at Raoyang Station. At 9:15 AM, during the clash, Japanese planes arrived to scout the Goubangzi and Jinzhou areas. At 11:00 AM, the Japanese armored train retreated to Baiqibao. At 11:50 AM, the Japanese armored train returned to the area outside Dongyangqi near Raoyang Station and opened fire, resulting in fierce fighting. The Beining passenger train only reached Dahushan on the 27th. Bridge No. 36 at Raoyang River was destroyed, and trains No. 102, No. 104, and No. 14 were all blocked. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shanhaiguan stated that at 11:50 AM, a train of Japanese soldiers returned to Raoyang River and opened fire fiercely outside Dongyangqi near the station. The 19th Brigade stationed in Dahushan dispatched a battalion of troops at 1:30 PM this afternoon to provide assistance. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Jinzhou stated that various agencies and businesses in Xinmin County were forced by the Japanese army to fly the Japanese flag. County Magistrate Wei was detained by the Japanese army. On the morning of the 26th, a train of Japanese soldiers arrived at Baiqibao, attempting to head west. They forcibly demanded a route permit from the stationmaster, which was not issued, and then returned. Subsequently, two more trains of soldiers arrived, carrying over 600 soldiers, who were stationed inside and outside the city. Ono, the Japanese army squadron leader stationed at Julu River, arrived in Xinmin to take command. Telegraph communication between Jinzhou and Xinmin was disrupted. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Beining Railway passenger trains No. 102, No. 104, and No. 14, departing from Huanggu Village, were all detained by the Japanese army. Eastbound passenger trains only reached Dahushan. Railway Bridge No. 36 east of Raoyang River was destroyed by the Japanese army. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Two Japanese warships arrived off the coast of Qianyang in Suizhong County, and one Japanese warship from Qinhuangdao left for another destination. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Jinzhou stated that the Japanese army headquarters in Shenyang admitted that attacking Xinmin was the beginning of the campaign to capture Jinzhou. It is widely rumored in Shenyang that the Japanese army will take Jinzhou, and it is only a matter of time. Part of the firearms of the Xinmin security team were confiscated, and the security team withdrew seven or eight li from the county town. The Japanese army fired over twenty shots at the Gaotaizi north of the city. The 6th Battalion of the Japanese garrison concentrated in Yingkou and will soon advance westward. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, a train of Japanese armored cars arrived at Raoyang River Station and fired over ten shots before returning to Xinmin. The Beining train No. 102 was delayed by seven hours. Part of the Japanese gendarmerie in Yingkou moved to Huangzhuangtai. Although the Japanese army is eager to attack Goubangzi and pressure Jinzhou, they seem to have reservations due to the presence of consuls from England, America, Germany, and France investigating in Jinzhou, and they dare not take immediate action. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Reuters learned from responsible foreign sources that the clash between Chinese and Japanese armored trains at Raoyang River (between Xinmin and Goubangzi) at 9:15 AM this morning resulted in unknown casualties. Later, according to reports from Chinese officials, 200 Chinese soldiers clashed with a Japanese armored train and a train carrying 700 Japanese soldiers. The Chinese soldiers retreated, and the Japanese soldiers temporarily occupied Raoyang but soon retreated northeast. The Chinese soldiers re-entered Raoyang. Japanese planes flew over Jinzhou three times this afternoon, apparently to scout Chinese troop movements. Of the 1,700 Japanese residents in Beiping, over 1,000 have returned to Japan. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A skirmish occurred between Japanese soldiers and bandits at Pinglepu, ten miles west of Shenyang. It is reported that a small squad of Japanese soldiers encountered several hundred bandits this afternoon and were still fighting at midnight. The Japanese army at Julu River, after receiving the alarm, has set out to provide assistance. The situation elsewhere remains quiet. The Japanese army in Qiqihar is gradually withdrawing, leaving only a small squad. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Japanese soldiers moving down the Beining Railway from Xinmin seized a Chinese armored train near Dahushan. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The main force of the Japanese army attacked Chinese troops at Baiqibao on the Beining Road at 11:30 AM this morning. The Chinese army bravely resisted and is currently engaged in a fierce battle. Details are unknown. Before the start of the battle this morning, Honjo ordered all Japanese troops along the Liao River to move to the front lines. At 8:20 AM in the morning, a mixed regiment of the 8th Division of Hirohata, which arrived last week, also departed from Shenyang led by Suzuki, destination unannounced. In addition, a train of armored cars carrying fifty soldiers departed from Shenyang for Baiqibao. Currently, railway, telephone, and telegraph communications between Tianjin and Shenyang are cut off. (27th Nationalist Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Last night, a ticket collector of the Beining Railway, along with his wife and one child each, left Huanggu Village Station. There were no Japanese soldiers stationed at the station, but a sentry post was set up across the street. When these four people crossed the street, they were spotted by the sentry, who stopped them in Japanese. The four, likely startled, ran away, with the father and son in the lead. Unexpectedly, the Japanese sentry raised his rifle and shot the father and son down, killing them instantly. The moonlight was bright at the time, and the people could be easily identified. However, the Japanese sentry committed this atrocity for no reason, taking human life lightly, which is truly regrettable. Moreover, Shenyang is currently calm and peaceful, with no incidents occurring for several weeks. There is no curfew in effect, and the sentry had no reason to shoot people.

<p>Residents of the Japanese Concession Evacuate</p>
<p>(Tianjin) From 9:30 PM on the 26th to 2:00 PM on the 27th, the Japanese army fired shells at government offices and streets for over two hours. Gunfire still continued intermittently. Due to the special curfew in the Chinese area, it was impossible to conduct an on-site investigation. The following information was obtained from phone calls: One shell landed at the No. 5 Precinct in District 1; two shells landed at the Jinjiajiao bathhouse, with the aim of destroying the electric plant; two shells landed at the No. 5 Precinct in District 4; one shell landed at the No. 10 Squad of the South Xiejie Security Corps; the Special Court was hit; two shells landed at the bottom of the Ningjia Bridge, injuring one police officer; two shells landed at the bottom of South Gate; over ten shells landed on the East Racecourse Road, killing one police officer; over ten shells landed outside various courtyards; one shell each landed on Yuanwei Road and Huangwei Road, with the aim of attacking our Second Army Headquarters; one shell landed at the West District Office; five or six shells landed in the Ding area of Fuqiao River; five or six shells landed in front of the Public Security Bureau. About one-third of these shells did not explode, one-third landed in open spaces, and one-third exploded. Details of the losses will be reported later. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese military announced a special curfew and designated the Japanese Concession as a war zone. All lights were turned off at dusk. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) From 11:00 PM on the 26th, Mayor Zhang dispatched many people to monitor our defense lines, prohibiting the security team and police from firing a single shot. When plainclothes troops attacked, they were to use hand grenades. However, the Japanese army continued to shell without stopping, until 2:30 PM on the 27th when the shelling ceased. Gunfire continued intermittently. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Xueliang replied to the provincial and municipal authorities, stating that there should be no resistance against the Japanese in Tianjin, and no provocation should be initiated by our side. If the Japanese army attacks the city, resistance should be offered while avoiding the British, French, and Italian concessions. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese authorities ordered the residents of the Japanese Concession to evacuate within twelve hours, otherwise they would not be responsible for their protection after 6:00 PM on the 27th. The Asahi Street South Exit was immediately opened, and residents of the concession fled towards the French Concession like a tide. Even Japanese women and children fled through the barbed wire of Toumo Street and Akashi Street. At 3:00 PM, the Japanese military issued a proclamation of over a thousand words, roughly stating that China was not fulfilling its treaty obligations and was bullying Japan, and that the Japanese people could no longer endure it. In order to maintain Japanese interests and protect Japanese residents, they had decided to take punitive measures against China and had notified the various consuls of this intention, and declared that Japan was determined to reinforce Tianjin. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, Chinese residents in the Japanese Concession are moving out one after another. The area where the unrest occurred is now quiet, but the entire city is very tense. It is widely believed that the incident was caused by old Chinese bureaucrats who organized plainclothes troops to overthrow the authorities. Even if the Japanese did not directly assist them, they must have offered assurances of sympathy. Yesterday's incident was long anticipated. Superficially, it seems to be related to the westward advance of the Japanese army in Manchuria. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) After the incident in Tianjin broke out again last night, Zhang Xueliang immediately telegraphed Wang Shuchang and Zhang Xueming to make proper defenses, and at the same time urgently telegraphed the central government, requesting that Shi Zhaoji be urgently instructed to bring the matter before the League of Nations. He also convened an all-night meeting at the Shuncheng Prince's Mansion, gathering important figures from Beiping, including Yu Xuezhong, to discuss countermeasures. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Deputy Commander's office received a report from Tianjin that at 3:15 PM this afternoon, two Japanese merchant ships carrying ninety marines arrived at Tanggu and landed. After being addressed by a Japanese officer, they transported twenty-seven boxes of guns and ammunition and six boxes of shells from Tanggu, arriving in Tianjin at 3:40 PM. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Henan Maru transported shells from Dalian to Dagu. The Japanese soldiers reported that there were 522 pieces of shells. The customs, in accordance with customs regulations, stipulated that munitions could not exceed 100 pounds, so they prevented the import. The Japanese consul sent a letter to the customs at 3 PM on the 27th, certifying that the shells did not exceed 100 pounds. It is reported that the customs decided to allow the Maru to enter the port on the morning of the 28th. Seventy Japanese soldiers, escorted by the Hakuyo Maru, transported the munitions, arriving in Tianjin at 7 PM on the 27th and docking at the Japanese Concession wharf. At 7:30 PM in the evening, the Japanese army began shelling again. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

(2) It is said that the Japanese military telegraphed Lushun to send more warships to Tianjin. (3) It is said that they telegraphed Lushun to transfer a brigade of sixty airplanes to Tianjin.

<p>Commander Kashii protested to the provincial and municipal authorities, demanding a reply within two hours, otherwise the Japanese army would take necessary measures. (1) The Chinese City Security Team and Police must disarm within thirty-six hours. (2) Withdraw twenty li away from the railway line. Our side did not reply. At 10:00 AM, Japanese Consul Goto protested to the municipal government, also demanding a reply within two hours. (1) Chinese military and police must cease hostile actions against Japan. (2) Troops must withdraw twenty li away. (3) The Security Team must withdraw to Hebei. (4) No military actions are allowed in Hebei Province. (5) Anti-Japanese movements must be abolished. The municipal authorities have telegraphed Zhang Xueliang for instructions and sent personnel to express to the Japanese consul that a reply will be given before 6:00 PM. Wang Shuchang's subordinates, hearing that the Japanese army had fired artillery last night, were extremely indignant and requested Wang to order proper defense, otherwise the subordinates would take self-defense measures. Wang has telegraphed Zhang for instructions. It is expected that if an appropriate solution cannot be reached on the 27th, there may be major chaos on the night of the 27th.

<p>(Tianjin) At around 4:00 PM, the provincial and municipal authorities replied to the five protests of the Japanese consul. (1) The Chinese police force is only suppressing plainclothes troops and has never taken hostile actions against Japan. (2) There are no troops in Tianjin. If you do not believe it, you can jointly investigate with various consuls on the ground. (3) The Water Police have the responsibility to protect the safety of Chinese and foreign people. After a method is established to maintain water security with other friendly nations, the Water Police can also withdraw. (4) The troops stationed throughout Hebei Province are still in a peacetime state and have no military movements. (5) Anti-Japanese movements have long been abolished. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Non-official Chinese sources report that after 8:00 PM last night, some plainclothes troops attacked the Chinese territory west of the Japanese barracks. The Chinese police opened fire with rifles to drive them away. Thereupon, the Chinese authorities ordered the police to use hand grenades when necessary. Before long, the Japanese army bombarded with mortars. Thereafter, the two sides resisted each other once every hour, all night long. The Japanese army continued to fire machine guns, rifles, mortars, and mountain guns. The telephone exchange was subsequently destroyed by bombing. Many shells landed in Tianjin City, and the extent of the damage is not yet known. Twenty Chinese were killed or injured. This morning at 10:00 AM, the Japanese military commander sent an ultimatum to the Chinese authorities, making five demands: (1) The Chinese must cease all hostile acts. (2) The Chinese must effectively withdraw their troops to a distance of six miles. (3) Military and police personnel must all be moved to Hebei. (4) All actions of Chinese soldiers (whether in uniform or plainclothes) must cease immediately. (5) The Chinese must effectively cease all anti-Japanese activities and acts of insulting the Japanese. The above ultimatum is due today, but the Chinese side cannot reply before 6:00 PM this evening. According to responsible Chinese sources, no Japanese soldiers were seen in Tanggu this morning, but a certain Japanese transport ship was seen unloading 480 boxes of ammunition this morning. It is reported that the Chinese are currently asking the consuls and military authorities of various countries whether foreign troops can be assigned to protect the Chinese telephone exchange, power plant, and water plant. As for the rumor that American troops have been dispatched to the Tangshan Kaiping Coal Mine, there is absolutely no basis for it. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>League of Nations Drafting Committee</p>
<h3 id="e6">Drafts New Resolution <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>British Observer Report Arrives in Paris</p>
<p>Proving That the Japanese Army Has Indeed Engaged in Provocative Acts</p>
<p>Shi Zhaoji Met With Briand Yesterday</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Drafting Committee met at 10:34 AM this morning to draft a new resolution. The Drafting Committee is composed of Briand, Cecil, Madariaga, and Colban, and was appointed by yesterday's closed-door meeting. It is reported that the new resolution will be based on Wednesday's resolution, with only a few amendments to reconcile the claims of the Chinese and Japanese representatives. The issue of troop withdrawal will likely remain as stipulated in the September 30 resolution, and the neutral investigation team will retain maximum authority. It is said that because the United States has guaranteed cooperation, a deadline for troop withdrawal may not be specified, and Japan's so-called self-defense measures will also be inserted into the resolution, but the wording regarding attacks by bandits will not be as solemn as the Japanese demanded. After the new resolution is drafted, it will be considered by the twelve council members in a closed-door meeting at 4:00 PM today. If accepted, a copy will be sent to U.S. Ambassador Dawes, and three or several members, including Briand, will send the resolution to the Chinese and Japanese representatives tonight. If both countries agree, it will be presented for passage at a public meeting tomorrow. (27th Nationalist News Agency)</p>
<p>(Paris) After Briand finished drafting the resolution this afternoon, Chinese Chief Representative Shi immediately visited at 12:15 PM, notifying him of alarming news from Jinzhou, stating that the Chinese troops there were in danger of being attacked by the Japanese army, and requested that Briand pay attention to the report of the British military observer, proving that Japan's claim that 50,000 Chinese troops were concentrated in Jinzhou was completely false and fabricated in order to create an excuse for the Japanese army to attack. According to the British representative's report to the Council, British military observers reported on Wednesday afternoon that the situation in Jinzhou was normal, and no Chinese troops were seen preparing to attack, nor were any Chinese authorities seen sending troops out of the pass. The commander of the Chinese troops there denied concentrating troops in Tongliao, and firmly expected that the Japanese army would soon arrive in Jinzhou, but apparently had not made defensive preparations. The Chinese troops in Jinzhou consist of three infantry brigades and one artillery brigade, totaling 23,000 men. However, the Northeast 9th Brigade is also stationed at Shanhaiguan, guarding the area between Yu and 〇. According to reports from the Jinzhou Command, the Japanese army occupied Xinmin on Wednesday, and 1,400 men are continuing to advance southwest. Also, 100 Japanese sailors landed in Shanhaiguan without carrying weapons, etc. People in the League of Nations believe that neutral observers are now in Jinzhou, which is enough to reduce the danger of Japanese military attacks, but they do not completely agree with China's claim that there may be war in Jinzhou, believing that Japan has guaranteed to the League of Nations that if there is no provocative action, the Japanese army will no longer attack. However, Japanese generals and officials must have the freedom of action to suppress bandits, so it is expected that Japan will not risk endangering the Paris negotiations by an unnecessary attack and make the world and the Council disapprove of the Japanese people's actions. Although people in the League of Nations heard that 1,400 Japanese troops were advancing westward to Xinmin, they also felt very uneasy. Briand is prepared to warn with a stronger note when necessary to prevent conflicts in Jinzhou. It is said that Briand privately assured Shi Zhaoji that he had received the most formal announcement from the Japanese representative that the Japanese army would not occupy Jinzhou. However, although the British and French have received this news, the Japanese army has continued to advance westward in recent days, so people in the League of Nations claim that they must accept Aizawa's statement, regarding it as a formal guarantee from the Japanese government. If the Japanese army does invade Jinzhou, world opinion will overwhelmingly support the Council in taking the most severe action, withdrawing the ambassadors of the 54 countries stationed in Japan and proposing other sanctions, and inviting the United States to participate to strengthen its power. (27th Nationalist News Agency)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the draft resolution of the League of Nations Council on resolving the Manchurian issue was submitted, the Chinese side has not yet sent a reply. However, Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji has expressed to Briand that China has several opinions and hopes that the Council will add these points to the final resolution of the meeting. It is said that Shi's intention is to prevent China from insisting on its preconceived ideas, so that the Council will have no way to proceed with the investigation work. Therefore, the Chinese side very much wants to make the draft resolution suitable as a basis for discussion, so that the Council can have room for maneuver. It is heard that the Japanese side has already replied, delivered by Japanese representative Aizawa to Briand. Aizawa met with Briand, Chairman of the Council, at 3:00 PM today. The Japanese reply is to accept the draft resolution with an amendment, reserving the right of Japanese troops to take self-defense actions when they retreat from Chinese territory in Manchuria into the railway zone in the future. Furthermore, Japan has also proposed a small reservation regarding the dispatch of a neutral investigation committee. (26th Nationalist News Agency)</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a non-public meeting at 4:15 PM this afternoon, designating French Briand, British Cecil, and Spanish Madariaga as committee members to draft the second section of the Administrative Council's proposal, namely the matter of appointing a British delegation to investigate in Manchuria. Neither China nor Japan were listed. Reuters learned that before the meeting, Dr. Shi told Briand that he did not object to the Administrative Council's proposal in principle, but he had to raise the Jinzhou issue and the necessity of stopping the Japanese army from advancing. He wanted to obtain a guarantee from the Japanese government that it would respect the commitments in this proposal. He advocated expanding the powers of the League of Nations observers and especially hoped that their reports would be published as soon as possible. It is heard that Dr. Shi and Briand have almost accepted the Administrative Council's proposal in their discussions, but have not yet issued a formal notice of acceptance of the proposal. The Administrative Council's meeting this afternoon lasted one hour and five minutes, adjourning at 5:20 PM. It will reconvene this morning, at which time a reliable reply regarding China's acceptance of this proposal may be received. It is estimated that a public meeting can be held on Saturday or Sunday. It is heard that Briand told the members of the Administrative Council at the afternoon meeting that Japan did not object in principle to the establishment of a neutral zone. The Administrative Council then decided to authorize the military attachés sent to Jinzhou by the various embassies to negotiate the terms of establishing a neutral zone with the commanders of both sides on the spot. It is heard that Briand referred to Japan's attitude towards the Administrative Council's proposal as tacit consent. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Members of the Administrative Council, excluding the representatives of China and Japan, exchanged views with each other this afternoon in order to agree on the general intention of the draft that was notified to the newspapers yesterday. The Drafting Committee has been appointed and will meet at 10:30 AM tomorrow. After the chairman received the Chinese and Japanese letters regarding the situation near Jinzhou, he has discussed with the Administrative Council members the methods that can assist in preventing the danger of conflict. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Chinese representative Dr. Shi sent two pieces of intelligence from China to the League of Nations Secretariat today. One stated that the Japanese army occupied Xinmin on November 25, and the Japanese commander detained the magistrate of Xinmin in the Chamber of Commerce. The other was a Chinese document sent to Japan on November 25, denying China's claim that a large number of reinforcements were concentrated in Jinzhou and stating that Japan must be responsible if unfortunate events occur in Jinzhou and Xinmin. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) A certain important person, close to the Executive Yuan, told a reporter from this agency this afternoon that the solution proposed by the Executive Yuan is still good. The presence of the investigation committee in the Far East is tantamount to affirming international supervision on a daily basis. The committee monitors the situation on the ground uninterruptedly and will inevitably exert continuous pressure in the spirit of promoting its implementation on the troop withdrawal. It is also said that Japan's acceptance of the committee seems to be due to the firm demands of the United States. In September, that country was unwilling to hear about this matter. Now that it has approved, it has already abandoned three of the main points in its position. (1) The Manchurian affair does not allow third parties to interfere. (2) The five basic principles. (3) Direct negotiations. These views have all disappeared in an intangible way. Washington Nine-Power Conference</p>

<h3 id="e7">Deepening Disaster <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>An extremely serious new situation. It is now unfolding under the planned actions of the Japanese. One is the re-emergence of significant disturbances in Tianjin. Another is the dispatch of Japanese troops to advance on Jinzhou. Attacking Jinzhou and disturbing Tianjin is a deliberate and methodical initiation by the Japanese, a clear demonstration of their determination to challenge our country. The world should witness this with their own eyes.</p>
<p>According to recent telegraphic news, Japanese troops in Tianjin are bombarding our police who are suppressing the rioters. In the manner of the "Aisin Gioro Puyi letter," they are forcing our security forces to disarm and retreat to a distance of two li (approximately one kilometer) beyond the railway. All transportation near Tianjin city is cut off. A fleet of Japanese warships has gathered. The Japanese cabinet has even resolved to reinforce troops. Furthermore, the Japanese troops along the Liao River have also been fully mobilized, moving along the Beining Railway towards Jinzhou, preparing for a formal attack. Baqibao has already been occupied, and Raoyang River has also been disturbed. The situation is becoming increasingly serious.</p>
<p>On one hand, the Japanese are advancing step by step with military force. On the other hand, they are attempting to cover up their actions in Paris. They outwardly proclaim that they have no intention of seizing Jinzhou and other places by force. Fearing that the fact of their use of force cannot be concealed, they then counter-argue that Zhang Xueliang's troops are concentrating in Jinzhou, plotting a counter-attack on the Japanese army, and that the Chinese police in Tianjin attacked the Japanese concession, with bullets landing within its boundaries. Such arguments, which distort right and wrong and are completely contrary to the facts, should not be believed by anyone. Yet the League of Nations is feigning ignorance and deafness, not only failing to restrain Japan in the slightest, but also coercing China with all its might, disregarding the sacrifice of justice, the sacrifice of treaties, and the sacrifice of China, in order to obtain a temporary false peace and alleviate the current crisis. The plans of the Northeast Investigation Team and the indefinite postponement of Japanese troop withdrawal are purely based on Japanese intentions and are being forced upon us. Our country has already made its final concession, even willing to designate Jinzhou as a neutral zone to prevent the continued expansion of the crisis. However, the situation in Jinzhou and Tianjin remains so urgent. The Japanese are pushing our country to a point where it can no longer tolerate or concede, and their determination to ignite a war in the Far East is becoming increasingly evident. Therefore, we cannot but recognize that the League of Nations is deliberately condoning chaos and intentionally watching the Japanese destroy world peace.</p>
<p>The disturbances in Tianjin have erupted repeatedly. The disturbances originate not from the British and French concessions, but solely from the Japanese concession. The British and French garrisons have taken no action whatsoever. Only the Japanese army openly bombards our security police and obstructs our efforts to quell the disturbances. The instigator of the disturbances cannot be concealed by any sophistry. With Tianjin already incited, the advance on Jinzhou has also begun. Their purpose is nothing more than to avoid troop withdrawal and thoroughly expose the weakness and powerlessness of the League of Nations, to complete the Northeast independence movement under armed occupation, and to realize their imperialist ambitions. How will the League of Nations explain itself in this situation? And how will the people of our country save ourselves?</p>
<p>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</p>
<p>Even if [decisions are] opened and made, they may not necessarily be better than this, and the committee is a neutral country's supervisory body set up in Manchuria. The Nine-Power Conference may not be able to have a similar organization. At this point, the reporter of this agency asked a certain important person about the content of the committee’s organization. According to the answer, the number of the three members of the committee has not changed. On the French side, some advocated sending a soldier or a diplomat. The names of Plenipotentiary Minister Lagier (former Consul-General in Shanghai) and Knight (former Commercial Counselor) have been mentioned. On the British side, Hurst (judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice) will be appointed. Nothing has been heard from the American side. Former Secretaries of State Hughes and Kellogg are too old to be competent. The tasks of the assistants sent by China and Japan are very difficult and extremely important, especially the Chinese assistants, who must awaken the attention of the members to matters worthy of research. The current relationship between the Japanese military authorities and the local administrative organs will also be greatly affected, and will be changed accordingly. There are too many such things to mention. China can refuse to accept the draft, but in doing so, China will create a buffer country between itself and its opponent. It is also not without benefit to supervise disputes in the name of world opinion between our country and its opponent. (Havas News Agency Telegram on the 26th)</p>

<p>Claiming Self-Defense While Attacking Jinzhou</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese General Staff held an emergency meeting here today due to the start of the war on the Beining Railway and decided not to delay the attack on Jinzhou no matter how the League of Nations Council moves. Also, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has replied to Briand's warning yesterday to prevent conflicts in Jinzhou, claiming that the Japanese army has not taken any military action since September 18 that could lead to war or loss of life. All Japanese military actions in the past two months have been self-defense, only protecting the lives and properties of Japanese nationals and defeating bandits. It also falsely accused the Liaoning Provincial Government of concentrating troops in Jinzhou and sending bandits to harass the Japanese army, resulting in the current critical situation in Jinzhou.

<p>The League of Nations Has Made an Important Decision</p>
<p>Our Government Accepts the Arrangement</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Attitude of Japanese Officialdom</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on the 27th that since China raised the Jinzhou safety issue to the League of Nations Administrative Council, it has been discussed repeatedly for several days. Yesterday, the Council issued an important decision, which is to request the League to send inspectors to various important countries in Jinzhou, and to issue the following instructions to the inspectors of each country: (1) The inspectors should consult with each other to study the possibility of establishing a neutral zone between the Chinese and Japanese armies, or other ways to avoid conflict between the two armies. (2) They should contact the commanders of the Chinese and Japanese armies to take necessary measures. The Administrative Council also believes that in order for the instructions to the chief officer of the Chinese army stationed in Jinzhou to have preliminary results, the Chinese and Japanese governments should instruct the chief officers of the troops stationed in each country to contact the foreign inspectors. The Administrative Council has been signed by its chairman Briand and sent official documents to request the attention of the Chinese and Japanese governments on the above two points. In order to earnestly comply with the policy of peace and moderation, the Chinese government has accepted this proposal and is sending the necessary instructions to the chief officer of the Chinese army stationed in Jinzhou, informing him of the decision of the Administrative Council and ordering him to contact the foreign observers who have been sent. Pay attention to the Administrative Council's move to maintain peace and prevent the situation from becoming more serious. As for whether it will take effect, it all depends on Japan's attitude towards this matter. Regarding the above news, a certain person in the National Government issued the following remarks: Last Tuesday, the National Government informally notified the Administrative Council of the League of Nations of the dangerous situation created by the Japanese army headquarters in eastern Liaoning preparing to attack Jinzhou. On the same day, the National Government learned that the Japanese government had assured the Administrative Council of the League of Nations that Jinzhou was not in immediate danger of being attacked. At that time, inspectors from Britain, France, and Germany had arrived in Jinzhou and proved that China had not concentrated troops in Jinzhou, nor had reinforcements been dispatched from within the customs. On Wednesday, the National Government received reports from all parties stating that the Japanese side had military actions. The Chinese government immediately submitted an emergency proposal to the Administrative Council of the League of Nations, advocating the immediate establishment of a zone, under the supervision of military inspectors from neutral countries, in which neither the Chinese nor Japanese troops could pass. The Administrative Council convened an emergency meeting on Wednesday and immediately resolved that the member states that had sent inspectors to Jinzhou should instruct the military attachés of each country to immediately carry out the following: (1) Immediately formulate a plan for establishing a neutral zone or demarcation line to prevent conflict between the Chinese and Japanese armies. (2) Immediately notify the commanders of the Chinese and Japanese armies to comply with this method. The Chinese government has now instructed the Jinzhou garrison to comply and has informed Paris that China has accepted this method. The Administrative Council of the League of Nations has fully accepted and immediately stopped the definite warning put forward by the Chinese government, which proves that the Administrative Council and its member states have the determination to implement and fulfill the resolution of the Administrative Council.

<p>(Tokyo) French Ambassador Martel notified Foreign Minister Shidehara today that Zhang Xueliang had stated to the French ambassador in Beiping that he was prepared to withdraw troops from Jinzhou and establish a neutral zone, with civil administration and police affairs handled by the Chinese authorities. Japanese official circles commented on this proposal, saying that the withdrawal of Chinese troops and the establishment of a neutral zone would greatly ease the situation, but the police affairs issue must be agreed upon by the local authorities of both sides. The Japanese government will reply to the French ambassador, telling him that Japan welcomes Zhang Xueliang's proposal to withdraw troops from Jinzhou and establish a neutral zone, and that the police and administrative issues must be agreed upon by the local authorities of China and Japan there, without foreign interference. It is heard that the reply also stated that if the situation in Tianjin does not become serious and there is no urgent need to send reinforcements westward, Japan will not enter the neutral zone west of Jinzhou. If the situation in Tianjin deteriorates, Japan reserves the right to send troops from Manchuria through the neutral zone via the railway, as this route is the fastest. (Reuters Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>Although the Japanese have repeatedly reported that conflicts in the Jinzhou area are about to erupt, the situation is not so serious, as can be seen from the fact that the people of the government of the three eastern provinces who moved here from Shenyang have not yet left the city. The government here is the legitimate government of the three eastern provinces, and the rest are set up by independent soldiers, that is, Japanese puppets. The Chinese army near Jinzhou is now defending along the Daling River, and Xinmin Tun, 30 miles from Shenyang, was occupied by the Japanese army last night. (Reuters Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Official circles say that if the Japanese army attacks Jinzhou, it is true that the Japanese government will have to resign, because the military's move is tantamount to saying that the Manchurian military is not controlled by the government. On Wednesday, the Japanese military agreed with the government not to take independent actions, because they understood that the Japanese military's move to drive Chinese soldiers into the customs would cause dangerous disputes, and agreed that even if the situation develops, if the commander of the Japanese army believes that it is necessary to attack as a defense, it must first obtain the government's consent before attacking. Therefore, although there are newspapers saying that large-scale military operations have now begun, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs still believes that the Japanese army has no intention of attacking Jinzhou and believes that the existing military force in Manchuria is not enough to carry out this large-scale operation.

<p>(Beiping) Telegram from Harbin: Zhang Jinghui sent Ying Shun on the morning of the 27th with Deputy Zhang Lanjun of the guard corps and 500 guard soldiers to Heihe to take over the provincial administration. Five local ruffians from Heilongjiang came to Harbin on the 26th to discuss with Zhao Zhongren and Li Yintang, members of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, the method of establishing a new regime. It is said that the Japanese army will attack Ma Zhanshan's troops as soon as Ying Shun arrives in Heihe. The public security bureau chief Zhang Yinxiang maintains the security of Qiqihar, completely as a puppet. (Special Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Although Zhang Jinghui did not go to Heihe, he still remotely led the Heilongjiang regime. Before the Japanese side finds a suitable candidate, Ying Shun, the deputy director of the special police department sent by Zhang, will be stationed in Heihe to handle affairs. The special agents and the second battalion of the newly compiled guard corps of Zhang Jinghui will leave for Heihe tonight to maintain order. A radio station has been set up in Hailun, which can communicate with Beiping and Tianjin. Koreans in Heihe have been issued military uniforms and guns by the Japanese side and formed into a supplementary team. (Special Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Heilongjiang Security Association has 300 temporary policemen to maintain security. Although the Japanese army occupies Heihe, they are afraid that Ma Zhanshan will counterattack the provincial capital, and Japanese expatriates are still prohibited from returning to business. (Special Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Zhang Jinghui summoned the two battalions of police soldiers from Heihe on the 26th and said in a speech, "I am now over sixty years old and will never be a traitor. Now that no one is maintaining order in the capital of Heilongjiang, I will temporarily dispatch troops there. If Chairman Ma counterattacks in the future, I will definitely have a way to deal with it." (Special Telegram on the 27th)</p>

<p>New York Today, the New York World Telegram commented on Japan's position in the Three Eastern Provinces incident, with the headline "Suppose the United States Was Also Like Japan," stating that Japan claimed that China had violated its treaty guarantees to Japan, so Japan was fighting China to preserve the dignity of the treaty. This is the latest explanation for the Japanese government's military invasion of Chinese territory. Now Japan is destroying its treaty dignity to the United States and other countries, violating the League of Nations Charter, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. If Japan can have the right to invade China because China violates the treaty, then the United States and other countries also have the same right to invade Japan, bombard Japanese cities, overthrow local governments in Japan, and massacre thousands of Japanese people. Such foreign invasion of Japan will definitely be regarded as extremely unreasonable. Indeed, this move is unreasonable, so the League of Nations and the United States are not plotting a military invasion. If Japan thinks about this, it may also be able to see its truth as others see it. (National News Agency Telegram on the 26th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang told reporters that it was recently reported that the Japanese army was advancing westward to Jinzhou. It is heard that the League of Nations has notified the governments of China and Japan, advising the troops of both sides not to have combat behavior near Jinzhou, which would cause the disputes to expand further. Our country has no troops east of Jinzhou, and the police maintain public order. If a war breaks out, it will of course be a Japanese provocation. Some people advocate that I move to Jinzhou, but before I receive orders from the government, I cannot act without authorization. If the Japanese army forces Jinzhou, there must be a definite way to deal with it from the central government. Ma Zhanshan's troops have retreated to the Keshan and Baiquan area and are doing their best to find ways to rescue them. I hope that the League of Nations will stand on the side of justice so that the serious situation in East Asia can be resolved justly and reasonably, and world peace can be further effectively guaranteed.

<h3 id="e21">Satisfactory Result of Student Petition in Beijing and Shanghai <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>A Night and a Day Awaiting the National Government</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhong Explains Various Doubts</p>
<p>Chiang Personally Appears to Accept Requests</p>
<p>And Issues a Handwritten Order Expressing Determination</p>
<p>All Students Immediately Withdraw</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Students from various universities in Shanghai petitioned the National Government to urge the government to send troops, lasting a night and a day. At 1 PM on the 27th, Zhang Zhizhong, Director of Education of the Central Military Academy, first expressed his views in a conversational manner, saying that everyone has suffered hardships and endured hunger and cold for the patriotic movement. Such perseverance and outstanding spirit will move everyone. Resisting Japan and saving the country is the urgent wish of the whole country. The government has the responsibility to defend the country and protect the people, and there is no room for shirking responsibility. In the government's measures, the environment and facts must be carefully considered. Outsiders may not fully understand, resulting in misunderstandings, and even rumors abound. Students may be impulsive due to their enthusiasm, inevitably expressing doubts, and even feeling at a loss. Now, I will briefly answer the questions raised by you to the government due to doubts as follows: (1) On the issue of assisting Ma Zhanshan, Ma's withdrawal from Heihe was not because there were no troops to assist from the rear, nor was it because he had no ability to resist the Japanese army, but because there were plainclothes teams disrupting Heihe. The Japanese army continuously bombed with airplanes. In order to protect the lives and property of hundreds of thousands of people and foreign teachers in the city, he could not bear to see the people suffer, so he had to take appropriate measures. Since September 18, the central government has been planning the affairs of the eastern provinces every day. During Ma Zhanshan's resistance against the Japanese army, there was also daily telegram exchange with the central government. To say that the central government sat idly by and did not provide assistance is to misunderstand the truth. (2) On the issue of punishing Zhang Xueliang, everything should not please the enemy and grieve the loved ones. The Japanese openly declared their opposition to Zhang Xueliang returning to the three eastern provinces. If Zhang Xueliang's power in the three eastern provinces can be eliminated, then the withdrawal of troops can be discussed. It can be seen that the Japanese are extremely opposed to Zhang Xueliang because he usually upholds national rights. Now, Zhang Xueliang should be allowed to redeem himself with merit and be responsible for recovering the lost territory. After the military situation is settled, this matter will be submitted to the judgment of the national public opinion. (3) On the issue of prohibiting student petitions, the government has always received students from all over the country who come to Beijing to petition. The purpose of the petition has also been accepted without exception. The facts in the past two months are all there. If the government does not allow students to petition, the transportation department can at any time not provide convenience. How can you come to Beijing? (4) Regarding foreign affairs, we must first seek internal unity. The government is painstakingly anxious to seek domestic peace and unification as the foundation for saving the country and resisting foreign aggression. However, recently, Guangdong has overturned the resolution of the Shanghai Peace Conference, which has created obstacles to peaceful unification and has a great impact on foreign affairs. You should understand the responsibility for undermining peaceful unification and correct it with national public opinion. Later, Chairman Chiang took the stage to give instructions, saying that the students endured hunger and cold and expressed their sincere patriotism with their perseverance and outstanding spirit, which is enough to make the enemy know the ambition and strength of our people, and should not be underestimated. He is very gratified. The wishes of the students here, if they trust the government and cooperate with the government to unanimously resist foreign aggression, will be an effective movement. If this kind of effect is lost and becomes a tool for a few people, then they themselves will have no center of gravity and strength, and can they still cope with diplomatic confrontation with the enemy? Foreigners judge the strength of China's power by the gathering and scattering of the Chinese people's spirit, the level of knowledge, and the purity and complexity of psychology. If the Chinese people are weak in knowledge and scattered in spirit, even if there are land, sea, and air forces, it will not be enough to resist the enemy. If the level is high and the strength is concentrated, even if the land, sea, and air forces are not as good as the enemy, they will not be taken advantage of by the enemy. Moreover, people bully our country and our nation because our people do not trust the government, causing the government's prestige to be swept away, and reactionary elements take the opportunity to make trouble, so that there is no way to rejuvenate both internally and externally. University students are the backbone of the intellectual class. This kind of reasoning should be understood. The students have been here for more than a day and night. Although I have not met with them immediately, I am always thinking about the suffering of my dearest youth who are enduring hunger and cold. The reason why I have not met with the students later is because I have seen points in the petition conditions that are unreasonable and exceed the norm. They cannot understand the government's painstaking efforts, and seem to express distrust of the government. Those with high knowledge and sincere patriotism should not have done this. Regarding this point, I am very heartbroken and very ashamed. I only hope that the students will make a judgment on their conscience, take a consistent attitude with the government with a pure and noble spirit, resist foreign aggression, save the country, and fight to the end. Regarding the doubts of the students about the government's measures, Director Zhang has explained them separately, and I hope you can understand. Then, the delegation replied, stating that we all have twelve points of trust in the government. This petition is purely for saving the country and is by no means manipulated by a few people. When departing, everyone made a vow, please do not misunderstand the chairman. However, because the invaders are entering deeper and the country is dying day by day, people are panicked and cannot live a day. Therefore, please ask the chairman to resolutely decide on the military and diplomatic policies to deal with the national crisis, so as to protect the integrity of the territory and comfort the hearts of the people. Chiang said that in this case, I am very gratified. I will definitely accept the requests of the students and stand in front of the people to sacrifice and fight. The delegation also asked Chiang to issue a handwritten order to express his determination to go north to recover the lost territory, so as to comfort our wishes. Chiang immediately agreed, and finally solemnly declared that he would absolutely take responsibility, do his best, and die only after exhausting his efforts. Everyone was satisfied, and there was thunderous applause. At that time, Zhang Zhizhong said that the Central Military Academy had prepared food and accommodation on behalf of the delegation, please go to rest. The handwritten order will be handed over in person after it is completed, and I will be responsible for handing it over in person. The delegation still asked to wait for the handwritten order to be issued before dispersing. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang issued a handwritten order to the Shanghai University Student Delegation Urging the Government to Send Troops, saying, "Dear students of various universities, I am deeply gratified by your patriotic enthusiasm in coming to Beijing to petition. I, the chairman, have long been determined to be loyal to the party and the country. I can accept your petition. Regarding military and diplomatic issues, Director Zhang has been sent to explain, and everyone should understand. I hope the students will tell their classmates to study with peace of mind, support the government, and do their duty." This edict, when Chairman Chiang gave instructions, the Shanghai University Delegation stated that the Shanghai Student Federation believed that the Guangdong Fourth Plenary Session's denial of the Shanghai Peace Conference resolution was undermining peace and had made a serious statement, saying that in this critical diplomatic period, anyone who undermines peaceful unification is an enemy of the people. It can be seen from this that our colleagues trust the government and support peaceful unification. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) More than 180 students from Tsinghua University who petitioned left the National Government at 5 PM on the 27th after listening to Chairman Chiang's instructions and returned to Pingjing by crossing the river that evening. The Shanghai University Petition Delegation decided to return to school on the 28th after the petition had yielded results. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shanghai university students went to the National Government on the 26th to petition. Chairman Chiang was unable to meet them due to a meeting at the Central Committee. The students did not disperse until late at night. The National Government temporarily vacated offices to accommodate the students for rest. On the morning of the 27th, the参军处 (Military Affairs Office) provided the students with tea and snacks and continued to await Chiang's appearance. Chiang sent Zhang Zhizhong, Director of Education of the Military Academy, to first meet with the students. At 1 PM, Chiang personally appeared. The students were in high spirits and maintained strict order. After the student representatives presented the key points of the petition, Chiang gave a sincere and earnest speech to the students for more than an hour, which moved everyone. After the speech, the students were satisfied and shouted slogans such as "Support the National Government," "Support the Chairman in Recovering the Lost Territory of the Northeast," and "Down with Japanese Imperialism" and withdrew in an orderly manner. (Central News Agency telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Shanghai university students who petitioned withdrew from the National Government in an orderly manner, they went straight to National Central University to rest. The参军处 (Military Affairs Office) was deeply concerned that the students had spent a day and night at the National Government on the 26th. Although it had ordered its subordinates to provide proper accommodation, they were still inevitably hungry and cold. Therefore, it specially appointed several commissioners to rush to National Central University to take care of them, instructing them to prepare the students' food, clothing, and accommodation properly. The commissioners are currently rushing to handle this, and are extremely busy. (Central News Agency telegram on the 27th)</p>

<p>Not Appropriate to Blame Each Other in Serious Times</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Professors of National Central University recently published a letter to students, saying, "Today's China, the entire country and nation, has reached an unprecedentedly serious period. Internally, natural disasters and man-made disasters occur frequently, and there are frequent disturbances. Externally, powerful neighbors send troops and national territory is occupied. In this serious period, it will not help if the Chinese people merely blame each other. Looking at the methods of various countries in dealing with national crises, none of them fail to work together to seek a unified front. Even those who are usually dissatisfied with the government, due to the national crisis, turn to do their best to support and assist it, so as to increase the strength to resist foreign aggression. Our colleagues believe that the way our country should deal with the national crisis at present has been recognized by the Chinese people, that is, to unite internally and not to yield externally. However, in order to achieve the goal of not yielding, it is by no means enough to just verbally declare war. We must have sufficient preparations in both finance and military affairs before we can talk about war. Even if we fight, we must rely on the firmness of the national spirit to be able to last. At present, it is the time for the government to strictly plan and operate. Our people across the country should calmly wait for orders, and our students across the country should temper their minds and bodies in preparation for general mobilization. However, in recent days, students from various universities have been eager to love the country and are often driven by emotions, which in turn reduces the efficiency of the government's foreign work and gives opportunities to the enemy. Is this the original intention of our youth? Our colleagues believe that the task of saving the country cannot be accomplished in a day or two. Goujian destroyed Wu, and it still required twenty years of recuperation and training. Today's wars require manpower and knowledge hundreds of times more than in the past. It goes without saying that it requires a longer period of preparation. Therefore, if our youth across the country truly take national affairs as their own responsibility, they should devote themselves to the intellectual preparation for saving the country. Such as the current strikes and abandonment of studies, running around to petition, this is truly not a good plan and is not something that our colleagues can agree with. Sincere advice, I hope you will consider it. Professors of National Central University." (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>

<p>Wan Fulin Returned to Beiping Last Night</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wan Fulin and Bao Wenwei were summoned by Chiang on the morning of the 27th to discuss Northeast affairs. After the task is completed, they will return to Beiping to report. Xiong Shihui and Cao Haosen were ordered by Chiang to go to Beiping to visit Zhang Xueliang to discuss important matters and plan to travel with Wan Fulin and others. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wan Fulin took the Pingpu train north at 6 PM on the 27th to report. Bao Wenwei temporarily stayed in Beijing for contact. Wan said to others before leaving that after the Japanese army forcibly occupied Liaoji, they used all means to entice and threaten our local officials. Harbin is the throat of the three eastern provinces, and Zhang Jinghui is stationed there. Surrounded by Japanese forces, the difficulty of dealing with it can be imagined. However, all the external rumors were instigated by the Japanese side, hoping to disrupt the Chinese people's hearing. Zhang has served in the eastern provinces for more than ten years, and would rather endure things that would lose his personal integrity. However, the environment is bad and it is not easy to break through, which may not be understood by the Chinese people. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>Delegates Who Withdrew from the Guangdong Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<h3 id="e25">Issue Two Circular Telegrams <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Unanimously Endorsing Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>Accepting Encouragement to Go to the Battlefield Together</p>
<p>One to Various Organizations</p>
<p>Declaring the Truth of This Withdrawal</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) More than 220 delegates who withdrew from the Guangdong Fourth Plenary Session issued two important telegrams. (1) To Mr. Wang Jingwei of Shanghai, I am greatly moved by reading your telegram. Since the outbreak of the Japanese invasion of the eastern provinces, the people of the whole country have been eager for unification and to die for the national crisis together. Representatives from 宁方 (Ning faction) have arrived in Guangdong one after another. Mr. Wang is anxious about foreign aggression and advocates using political solutions to replace military solutions. He spares no effort and personally participates in peace talks. Although the resolutions passed may not fully meet your intentions, your painstaking efforts to protect peace have been made clear to the world. The purpose of our trip to the south was originally to promote unification, but a small number of people are courageous in the pursuit of private interests and disregard the survival of the nation. They brazenly made a decision to undermine peaceful unification. We could not bear to see the peace that Mr. Wang had painstakingly created for several years destroyed in one fell swoop, so we resolutely withdrew together and gathered in Hong Kong. We feel the pain of the demise of the party and are also worried about the demise of the country. Our blood is boiling and we want to die without a place to die. Your telegram encourages us to join the Fourth Army and go to the battlefield together. We are moved by righteous indignation and unanimously accept it, vowing to perish together and do our best to fulfill our responsibility to save the country. A statement of grief and indignation, I hope you will consider it. (2) To all levels of party departments at home and abroad, the governments of all provinces and cities across the country, all mass organizations, and all newspapers, the purpose of the establishment of the Central Extraordinary Conference is to seek the realization of democratic politics in politics and to achieve sincere unity and seek the establishment of a democratic centralized system in the party. When the Japanese army forcibly occupied the three eastern provinces, in order to respond to the desire of the people of the whole country for peaceful unification, there was the holding of the Shanghai Peace Conference, and there was the establishment of various resolutions of the Peace Conference. The representatives carefully examined its content and the methods for resolving party affairs. Although they were unable to fully satisfy it, how could they bear to destroy peace and obstruct unification at the current time of national crisis? However, a part of the representatives of the Fourth Plenary Session, disregarding the current great disaster, resolutely overturned this resolution of the Peace Conference, causing the glimmer of hope for peaceful unification to disappear. The representatives are confident that their efforts over the years have been consistent, but they dare not agree with this reckless act that completely disregards the national interest and welfare of the people, so they withdrew from the conference together to seek a way to remedy it, and strive to realize peaceful unification. I hereby inform you and hope you will understand. Another declaration was issued, which was roughly the same as the above telegram. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>

<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 27th - After midnight yesterday, the French Parliament passed a motion of confidence in Prime Minister Laval's foreign policy by a vote of 320 to 150. Laval's foreign policy</p>
<p>Within the framework, the payment of Allied war debts and reparations is stipulated, but in times of global financial and economic panic, temporary measures will be accepted to temporarily alleviate Germany's reparation burden as stipulated in the Young Plan. (2) France will agree that the priority of reparations can only be proportional to the reduction of France's war debts. (3) France does not agree that Germany has the right to prioritize the repayment of private debts over reparations. (4) France insists that the unconditional part of Germany's reparations should continue to be paid. France has demanded this even before the Hoover Plan, based on the above four points.</p>
<h3 id="e48">German Socialist Party's Conspiracy to Stage a Coup Discovered <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 26th - Yesterday, the police searched the general office of the National Socialist Party in Darmstadt and found many important documents. Prior to this, the party leader Hitler had made a solemn statement that his party members would definitely seize power without exceeding the scope of the law. This declaration has been disproved by the results of the search. The documents seized are the party's plan to stage a coup. According to news from the National Socialist Party's news agency, the party's important leaders gathered in Hesse in mid-September and drafted various documents, discussing the procedures for the coup. The general idea is that the National Socialist Party's shock troops would declare armed dictatorship, overthrowing the federal and Hesse constitutions at the same time. According to the party's central organization's long-decided plan for the transfer of administrative and legislative powers, the party's shock troops would become the police of each state after the uprising. The coup declaration drafted by the party contains an ambiguous explanation of the scope of the law. The general idea is that once those who previously held federal and state power are overthrown by the incident, a new legal status will naturally arise with the transition of the incident, similar to the overthrow of the imperial system in November 1918. Previously, a Hesse legislator named Xue Fei, who had long been at odds with the National Socialist Party, informed the police department, and the conspiracy was broken.</p>
<p>Another telegram states that the National Socialist Party's main organ said that this case was obviously a malicious accusation by the Social Democratic Party. The documents are all fake. The organ will publish its views on the matter as soon as it receives the necessary information and said that any party members who engage in illegal activities will be expelled from the party. The German newspaper reported that if the local coup conspiracy in Darmstadt succeeded, excessive chaos would be inevitable. No matter how this case develops, it has great significance in the changes in German domestic politics, because the attempt to unite the central party and the National Socialist Party has failed.</p>

<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 26th - The International Disarmament Conference held its opening ceremony at the Palais des Nations today, presided over by Lord Cecil of Britain. More than 600 representatives from 17 countries and 171 organizations attended. Cecil delivered a brief opening speech, saying that competitive armament is the greatest harm to mankind. He dared to ask the people of all countries to urge their governments to eliminate this obstacle on the road to civilization. It was decided that Senator Borah, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, would give a radio speech across the Atlantic, advocating that all countries implement disarmament uniformly. The conference is scheduled for three days, and it is expected that many celebrities will attend the conference to give speeches. Briand hosted a banquet for the representatives this afternoon. However, Corday, a water manufacturer, posted tens of thousands of slogans throughout the city, asking the public to gather on Friday to demonstrate against the conference's unwarranted interference in France's armaments.</p>

<p>Colluding with Bandit Troops to Disrupt the Beining Line</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Repeatedly Bomb Xinmin</p>
<p>Tianjin correspondence: The Japanese troops in the Northeast have taken over all three provinces since they occupied Qiqihar. Pu Yi, who was taken to Tianjin by Doihara some time ago, initially planned to organize the Mingguang Empire when he occupied Heilongjiang Province, which was established under the protection of the Japanese army. However, due to the complex internal situation in Heilongjiang, the proposal to restore the throne has been shelved. However, there is news of the organization of the Shenyang government in order to rule the three northeastern provinces. As for the temporary Liaoning Provincial Government established by our side in Jinzhou, the Japanese army is still actively trying to sabotage it. They have colluded with bandit troops and routed soldiers in various sections of the Beining Railway, allowing them to carry out disturbances along the line. The Japanese army is supplying them with guns and ammunition, and the Japanese army is taking the opportunity to advance into various counties in western Liaoning under the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese, putting pressure on the Liaoning Provincial Government. It is reported that Suzuki, the Japanese army brigade commander, led more than 200 Japanese soldiers from Shenyang on the morning of the 22nd and went to Xinmin, carrying a train loaded with ammunition and transporting it to the storage of the Japanese consulate in Xinmin. They also patrolled the Baiqibao, Raoyang River, and Xinmin areas by plane from time to time. On the same day, a bomb was dropped in Xinmin, fortunately without injuring anyone. On the morning of the 23rd, landmines and other explosives were secretly buried inside and outside Xinmin City and around the county government and county police station. A landmine exploded immediately at a location two miles away from Xinmin Station, shaking the whole city. Planes dropped more than a dozen bombs near the station, and Japanese armored car soldiers opened fire at the same time, shooting at the people. Yesterday (24th) afternoon, the Japanese army covered Mongolian and Korean bandits and attacked Gaotai Tian Village, 18 miles away from Xinmin City. The county security team arrived and killed more than a dozen people, including Japanese soldiers. The bandits, seeing that the situation was not good, intended to retreat and try again. Under the supervision of the Japanese army, the bandits moved forward again and fought the security team. Our security team was outnumbered and retreated. The bandits and the Japanese army then occupied the village. Wei, the magistrate of Xinmin County, negotiated with the Japanese consul, who denied any knowledge of it. At about 3:00 PM, a train of armored cars loaded with more than 100 Japanese soldiers arrived in Xinmin from Huanggu Tun and fired more than a dozen shots at the southeast of Xinmin City. The situation in Xinmin is now in a very critical state, and the scope of military operations is expanding. It is reported that another Japanese warship, the Guma, arrived in Qinhuangdao yesterday. It has a displacement of 10,000 tons and is full of wooden boxes containing munitions. When the Kailuan Mining Bureau inquired about the purpose of the ship, it was answered that it was to protect the radio station there. After the Japanese soldiers landed, more than 100 of them marched towards Shanhaiguan, obviously also with military action. The embassies stationed in Beiping recently received orders from the League of Nations to investigate the real situation in the Northeast. Yesterday, Adachi, a military attache of the British embassy, Malade, a military attache of the American embassy, Hans, a military attache of the French embassy, and Rabbi, a counselor, passed through Tianjin and went to Jinzhou one after another. It is said that the investigation time is limited to one month.</p>
<p>The hidden worries in Tianjin have not yet subsided. The Japanese concession is heavily guarded and very serious. After the Belgian Chamber of Commerce protested, trams were allowed to pass through the Japanese concession, but they were not allowed to stop, and the inspection was very strict. Although the shops in the Japanese concession are open, they are deserted. It is rumored that Doihara secretly came to Tianjin again yesterday, fearing that there will be another disturbance.

<h3 id="e54">Heilongjiang Provincial Government Moves to Hailun <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Ma Zhanshan Safely Arrives in Eastern Heilongjiang</p>
<p>Zhang Jinghui Still Dares Not Go to Heilongjiang</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Zhang Jinghui's going to Heilongjiang to take charge of the government has been determined by the Japanese army. However, the news has been circulating for three days, and Zhang has not yet set off. It is said that Zhang is concerned about his future. Although he relies on the power of the Japanese and no one dares to oppose him if he rashly goes to Heilongjiang, it is ultimately difficult to win people's hearts and rectify his name. Under the power of the Japanese army, he cannot request orders from the central government. He can only pretend to be supported by the people to preserve his face. He specially entrusted Zhao Zhongren, Li Yintang, and others from the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee to find ways to mobilize representatives of merchants and gentry in Heilongjiang to come to Harbin to invite him, and then he would go to take office. Zhao and others received the order and returned to Heilongjiang the day before yesterday to handle it. They will come to Harbin again in the next few days to urge him. It is rumored that Xi Qia will come to Harbin this week to discuss the unification of the Northeast and decide on the successor to the chief executive of the special zone. Zhang's failure to go to Heilongjiang immediately is probably to wait for Xi. Last night (21st), a Japanese colonel, on the orders of his 2nd Division Commander Domen, came to Harbin. Introduced by Japanese Consul Ohashi Tadashi, he met with Zhang in secret talks. Although it is impossible to know the inside story, it is still expected that he will still urge Zhang to go to Heilongjiang. As for the situation in Heilongjiang, it is entirely under the control of the Japanese army. Domen, the commander of the Japanese army division, has occupied the office of the deputy commander of Heilongjiang, and the military police brigade is entrenched in the provincial capital's public security bureau. In addition, the Industry Department, the Education Department, and the provincial party headquarters have also been occupied by Japanese soldiers. All telegrams and telegrams sent and received by the telephone and telegraph bureau must be checked by the Japanese. Telephone calls must be made in Japanese. Shops have not opened for three days since the Japanese army occupied the provincial capital. Yesterday, the Japanese army sent a message to the chairman of the chamber of commerce, ordering him to order the shops to open for business. Although some shops have opened, the business hours are very short, opening at 10:00 AM and closing at 3:00 PM. Food prices have skyrocketed, with each dou of grain costing 1.9 yuan and each catty of salt costing 0.3 yuan. Besides the Japanese soldiers scattered throughout the streets and merchants forced to hang Japanese flags, there are very few Chinese. Although the Qi'ang Railway's small train runs as usual every day, no passengers ride it except for Japanese soldiers. The Ta'ang Railway and the Qi'ke Railway are occupied by the Japanese army. 　The Manchukuo Railway commissioned combat workers to replace the Qi'ke Railway's cars and manage the railway from the 22nd. Another 500 people were sent to restore the Ta'ang Railway and repair the Jiang　track. Ishiwara, the former Ta'ang Railway advisor of the Manchurian Town Committee, was appointed as the director, and Wan Xianxiang, the former engineer, as the deputy director. It is scheduled to open to traffic on the first of next month. It is reported that Chairman Ma Zhanshan safely 　arrived in Hailun on the 22nd and will set up the Heilongjiang Provincial Government there to reorganize everything. However, there are no funds at present, and he hopes that all parties will provide assistance. Hailun is the terminus of the Hu-Hai Railway, and the transportation is fairly convenient. The terrain is suitable for both offense and defense. Ma's retreat to Hailun is considered a threat by the Japanese army. Several thousand cavalrymen took the Zhongxing Town route from Mingyong yesterday to attack Hailun by surprise. Therefore, a battle is likely to occur in the Hailun area soon. When Ma led his troops to retreat on the 19th, the Japanese army pursued relentlessly along the Qi'ke Railway. On the 20th, they were ambushed and defeated in Yangjiatun. The Heilongjiang army, although defeated, was still very orderly. The infantry and artillery retreated first, and the cavalry covered the rear. When they passed Yangjiatun, 500 cavalrymen were hidden in the mounds, and more than 300 militiamen and police from Tai'an Town and Keshan County were ambushed in the nearby forest. At 4:00 AM on the 20th, the Japanese cavalry chased to the ambush site. The ambush troops launched a surprise attack from three sides. The Japanese soldiers fought in panic and could not distinguish between the real and the false. Dozens were killed, and the remaining troops were shocked and retreated. The Heilongjiang army was able to retreat to Keshan calmly. At 4:00 PM on the same day, the Japanese army increased their cavalry and artillery to 2,000 and continued to pursue along the Qi'ke Railway. A fierce battle took place at Guchengzi at 9:00 PM that night. With the support of the Baiquan militia, the Japanese army was still repelled. At 10:00 AM on the 21st, two Japanese planes went to Tai'an Town and Guchengzi Station for reconnaissance and dropped six bombs on Guchengzi, destroying the ticket office and the platform. There were no battles on the Qi'ke Railway until our army retreated to Baiquan on the 21st. (November 22)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Japanese Warships Disturbing Themselves in Wuhu <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Business Groups Opened Fire in Defense Against Bandits</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Deliberately Put on a Show of Panic</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Since the Northeast Incident occurred, the Japanese residents of Wuhu have been disturbing themselves for no reason and have moved away one after another. Except for a few who hid on large lighters, the rest were transported to Shanghai by Japanese ships. Later, because the people of Wuhu were extremely excited but very orderly, and the official authorities provided very thorough protection, everyone felt relieved. Those on the lighters have returned to their original residences one after another. However, the Japanese warships anchored on the river still adhere to their policy of force, shining searchlights on the city every night to carry out intimidation. The sailors who go ashore do not carry weapons, but their arrogant and domineering attitude makes passersby look askance. In recent days, all sectors of Wuhu have organized a comfort committee to reward Ma Zhanshan for his loyalty and bravery in defending against violence as a lone army in a remote area. They are raising military funds in order to provide a steady stream of assistance. Boys and girls from all schools and the entire boy scout troop were mobilized to solicit donations from house to house along the way. The people's morale was excited, which aroused the jealousy of the Japanese, who were always trying to provoke trouble. Yesterday (24th) at 9:00 PM, a militiaman from the 5th patrol station of the business group was patrolling the riverside of Henan Hankuan. He saw a suspicious river boat and ordered it to stop. The boat ignored the order and instead sailed back. The militiaman knew that there were many bandits in the jurisdiction of Wuwei County, Jiangbei, and was ordered to strictly guard against them. For the sake of local security, he had no choice but to fire a shot into the air to stop it. Then, because the boat still did not obey the order, he fired another shot, and the boat stopped. The militiaman boarded the boat for inspection and found that it was loaded with rice and grain, intending to smuggle it over. He immediately released it. The river surface was always calm as usual. Unexpectedly, the Japanese warship Hiraya was disturbed by itself and deliberately put on a show of panic, shining searchlights in all directions. However, the waves were as smooth as a mirror, and no gunshots were heard, so it could not display its power. It then flew to report to the Japanese consulate and sent Secretary Katsuki to the 171st Brigade of the 57th Division and the Public Security Bureau. In a panic, they reported to Brigade Commander Wang (Leshan) and Public Security Bureau Chief Zhao (Jingshi), falsely claiming that there were many gunshots and that a bullet had fallen on the warship, intending to frame them. The brigade headquarters sent Deputy Chief of Staff Fan Kehui, together with the Public Security Bureau, Inspector Lan Jie, and Security Team Leader Sun Zhaoqi, leading a platoon of soldiers and twenty box gunners, to rush to investigate the above situation. Yan Bindu, the foreign affairs secretary of the county government, went to the Japanese consulate and met with Japanese Consul Shibasaki Hakuo to explain everything. The military and police authorities stated that the business group's firing was purely an act to maintain local security, and the Japanese side was deliberately putting on a show of panic. It is not difficult to imagine their intentions. They have now telegraphed to the higher authorities separately to report the truth. (November 25)</p>
<h3 id="e56">Jinan Prohibits Cash from Leaving the Country <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the Tianjin Incident, business was completely suspended for more than ten days. Although the market has gradually resumed trading, people are wary, and cash is accumulated and not released, and financial conditions are extremely tight. One thousand yuan of Tianjin currency is worth forty taels more than the highest time in Jinan. Even in the past one or two days, it has been more than twenty taels. The silver and money firms in Jinan believe that it is profitable, and they have been vying to transport cash to Tianjin to make profits. Within three days, a total of more than 4 million yuan was transported out. When the Pingpu train passed Jibei on the evening of the 23rd, it loaded more than 1 million yuan. A certain bank alone has already transported 500,000 yuan. (It is heard that the bank has transported more than 1 million yuan to Tianjin before and after.) Jinan is a small place, and cash reserves are limited. After this huge outflow, the market has become very dry. In recent days, those who withdraw money from silver and money firms, no matter how much, have been paid with checks, and no cash is seen. There are even those who hold checks and run around all day, pushing back and forth, and cannot get cash. If they continue to transport cash in a steady stream, Jinan's financial system will be in great panic. In view of this, the provincial government issued a ban yesterday. Last night, various silver and money firms transported tens of thousands of yuan to the Jinpu Railway Station for shipment north, but the station had already received orders to refuse loading, so they were not transported out. At 4:00 PM today, Wang Xiangrong, the director of the finance department, gathered the managers of eight banks, including the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the China Industrial Bank, the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, the Shandong Commercial Bank, the Zhonglu Bank, and the Continental Bank, at the Ping City Official Money Bureau, and the managers of seventeen silver firms, including Deshengchang, Juxingchang, Yuanfengcheng, Yijulong, Yijusheng, Jufeng, Jinji, Tongju, Tongheyu, Ruizengxiang, Houchang, Xiejutai, Deju, Renkang, Gongqing, Yuankang, and Yuanxing, to discuss relief measures. First, Wang reported, roughly saying that since the Northeast Incident and the Tianjin Incident occurred, financial panic has occurred everywhere. Shandong is fortunate not to have been affected. However, in recent days, due to the lack of cash in Tianjin, banks and firms in this city have been transporting cash to Tianjin. It is the duty of merchants to seek profits. This matter would be irrelevant in peacetime, but in the current situation, it must be considered. Because, unfortunately, once there is a change, the financial sector will be greatly affected. For this reason, everyone is gathered here to discuss relief methods. The Finance Department has long planned to ban the export of cash, which will be announced within one or two days. It will be canceled after the situation stabilizes. This is purely for the financial consideration of the market. I hope everyone will understand the difficulties of the times and truly express their gratitude. Next, Xu Jizhuang of the Central Bank stood up and said that Director Wang's proposal is the only way to relieve the province's financial crisis, because due to the situation, it is necessary to prepare cash, and if a large amount of cash is transported out and then transported from Shanghai, it is very difficult. If an incident occurs, those who feel pain must be from the financial community. Everyone applauded. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. It is said that the measures set by the Finance Department are that private individuals can carry up to 500 yuan of cash out of the country, and public institutions are limited to 2,000 yuan. Amounts above 2,000 yuan must state the reasons and be approved by the authorities before they can be transported out. Today, there were still those who transported cash to Tianjin on the Jinpu northbound train, and they were all ordered to unload by the Supervision Department of the Public Security Bureau.

<h3 id="e57">Guangdong Academic Circles Vigorously Initiate Donations to Aid Heilongjiang <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Donation Teams Set Out to Solicit Contributions</p>
<p>Faculty and Students Voluntarily Donate and Practice Frugality</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The violent Japanese invasion of the Northeast, with Liaoning and Jilin successively falling, leaves only Ma Zhanshan in Heilongjiang province, supporting the precarious situation with a lone army. He valiantly resisted the fierce invaders, and although ultimately cut off from reinforcements and exhausted, unable to defend the Heilongjiang frontier, his unwavering defense of the territory and his demonstration of great righteousness to the world, his loyalty and courage are sufficient to inspire the national populace. Recently, all sectors of Guangdong Province have launched campaigns to raise significant funds to aid the Heilongjiang army. Simultaneously, various schools have also urgently formed volunteer corps, preparing to go to the front lines to engage in a life-or-death struggle with the violent Japanese. The donation situation of faculty and students in various schools is investigated as follows: (Sun Yat-sen University) The entire faculty, students, and staff of the university are divided into ten battalions: the faculty and students of the Faculty of Arts are the first battalion, the faculty and students of the Faculty of Science are the second battalion, the faculty and students of the Faculty of Law are the third battalion, the faculty and students of the Faculty of Agriculture are the fourth battalion, the faculty and students of the Faculty of Medicine are the fifth battalion, the senior high school faculty and students are the sixth battalion, the junior high school faculty and students are the seventh battalion, the affiliated high school and girls' high school are the eighth battalion, the staff are the ninth battalion, and the workers are the tenth battalion. Regarding donation procedures, patriotic donation tickets are printed and distributed, with 100,000 tickets at 20 cents each, 50,000 tickets at 40 cents each, 20,000 tickets at one yuan each, and 2,000 tickets at five yuan each, distributed to each battalion for solicitation. A donation committee is formed by the president, deans, directors, senior high school, affiliated high school, affiliated primary school, military training department, and three representatives from each department. In addition, faculty, staff, students, and workers of the school voluntarily donate, with professors donating half of their monthly salary, staff donating one-tenth of their monthly salary, university and senior high school students donating one yuan each, junior high school students donating 50 cents each, primary school students donating 40 cents each, and workers donating 10 cents each. (Provincial First Middle School) Each student donates one yuan and forms five propaganda teams, which will go to the countryside to promote awareness and carry donation books to solicit donations from wealthy people in the countryside for the Heilongjiang army's war expenses, starting on the 23rd. (Municipal First Middle School) On the 21st, a telegram was sent to Heilongjiang Province to慰问 all the officers and soldiers of the Heilongjiang army, and funds were remitted for the purpose of犒劳 the troops. (Guangzhou National University) Faculty and students donated 1,000 yuan to Heilongjiang Province for慰劳 funds, and another student donation team of 20 people was formed to set out on the 21st to solicit donations in the city. More than 190 boarding students from the affiliated high school formed an anti-Japanese frugality association. During this time of national crisis, all students will only have one meal every Sunday, and the money saved will be used for anti-Japanese purposes. (Zhixin School) Faculty and students organized a donation committee, and all faculty and students practiced frugality for one week, using the proceeds to aid the Heilongjiang army. They also telegraphed the government and Chen Mingshu, Li Zongren, and Zhang Fakui, requesting that they immediately lead troops to aid Heilongjiang. (Lingnan University) A general meeting was held on the 19th, and faculty and students immediately donated 3,000 yuan to aid Heilongjiang. On the evenings of the 23rd and 24th, a recreational gathering was held at the Taixia Theater, with music, drama, and dance performances, and all proceeds were donated to aid Heilongjiang. (Pui Ying School) A general meeting was held on the 19th, and in addition to immediate pledges, the school's deposit and students' breakfast savings, totaling more than 3,000 yuan, were remitted to Heilongjiang Province on the same day. In addition, Jiaozhong, Pui To, and Guangfu Middle Schools are all raising righteous donations in preparation for resisting Japan. Guanghua Medical School will soon form a volunteer corps. Furthermore, Sun Yat-sen University, Guanghua Medical School, Provincial First Middle School, Provincial Second Middle School, Women's Normal School, Girls' Middle School, and Industrial Vocational School jointly petitioned the government yesterday, requesting that a large army be immediately transferred north to aid Ma Zhanshan and defend the national territory.

<h3 id="e58">Disputes at Jiawang Coal Mine <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Since the Huadong Company took over the Jiawang Coal Mine and reorganized it, coal shafts have been developed daily, and coal production has become increasingly abundant. However, the company's treatment of local farmers and workers seems to be inadequate, leading to various disputes in recent months, such as cutting down electric poles and worker strikes. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Electric Pole Dispute: The Jiawang coal area is located east of the Liuquan Station of the Jinpu Railway in northern Xuzhou. The company has built the Jialiu branch line for coal transportation. The company has planted electric poles beside the branch line, within the farmers' fields. The nearby people believe that property rights have been infringed, so they organized a "Committee Against Huadong Company's Infringement of Rights" and appointed Zhu Rundong and others as representatives. In early October, they filed a complaint with the Tongshan County Government, ordering compensation for the losses. The county government ruled that infringement of property rights did not require such a large organization and should be pursued by the infringed parties. The complaint was rejected. The committee then filed a record with the county party headquarters and repeatedly negotiated with the Huadong Company. On the morning of the 19th of this month, about two or three hundred farmers from the association, each carrying a machete, cut down more than eighty electric poles near the Jialiu branch line. The Jialiu road police immediately reported to the company, which sent road patrol police to maintain order. In the evening, the farmers dispersed, and the branch line railway was preserved. According to the company's report to the county government, the former district chief Xue Yunsheng initiated this disturbance, and the current district chief Liu Jianqiu is manipulating it. The county government has ordered District Chief Liu to be responsible for prevention and not to allow the matter to escalate. The company has also reported to the Agricultural and Mining Department for protection, and the department has ordered the county government to handle the matter properly. Although this dispute has temporarily come to an end, it has not been completely resolved.</p>
<p>Strike Wave: The workers of the Huadong Company, because the treatment of employees is not equal and the workers mostly earn six yuan a month, which is not enough to maintain a living, raised four demands to the company in April: (1) A universal pay raise with a fixed percentage; (2) Coal transportation workers should all receive half-price benefits, and preferential treatment should not be given to officials while being stingy with workers; (3) Day and night shifts should be rotated to balance work and leisure; (4) Weekly holidays should be granted, otherwise double pay should be given. The company agreed to the first two articles, to be implemented when the company's daily coal output exceeds 400 tons. The third and fourth articles would be implemented after the promulgation of the Factory Law. In April, the daily coal output was about 300 tons. By September, the daily output had reached 500 tons, and the Factory Law was also promulgated in August. As a result, the workers reiterated their previous request, and the company agreed to consider it and respond on the 20th of this month. On the 19th, the company suddenly stopped issuing factory passes to the workers, and the workers stopped working in unison. Afterwards, the company announced that the non-issuance of worker passes was an individual error by the worker pass office clerk Qin Binfu and persuaded the workers to continue working as usual. The workers believed that the company had not yet given a satisfactory reply to the four demands and that stopping the issuance of passes was a bargaining chip, so they maintained their strike attitude and refused to resume work. The labor and management sides are gradually becoming evenly matched.</p>

<p>It seems that the company is likely to be accommodating, and it may be resolved after another round of consultations. (24th)</p>

<p>Summary of Resolutions of the County Administrative Council: The fourth county administrative meeting of this county was held at 9:00 a.m. on the 26th. The attendees included 26 members, including bureau chiefs and district directors, and 11 hired members. The county magistrate was promoted to the province on official business, and Secretary Tang Zhansheng was publicly elected to preside. The general meeting was held in the afternoon to discuss matters: (1) The county magistrate submitted the case of how to handle the shortfall in the local budget due to the reduction of autumn tax. It was resolved to submit it to the Finance Group for review. (2) The county magistrate submitted the case of how to raise funds for the district party headquarters. It was resolved that since the annual budget had been set, it was impossible to list it. For the time being, the Property Management Office will allocate 200 yuan per month from the district funds, and it will be planned and listed when the 21st-year budget is prepared. (3) The county magistrate submitted a proposal to establish a water patrol team in this county in the near future and to purchase a steamship with the funds not used from July to November, a total of five months, to facilitate patrols. It was resolved to retain the proposal. (4) Lu Longxiang, the director of the Property Management Office, proposed where to keep the water patrol fees collected this year.

<p>Local Gentry Telegraphed Requesting the Transfer of Wounded Soldiers: More than 2,000 wounded soldiers from the 60th Division of the 19th Route Army will be arriving in Suzhou from Jiangxi soon. Local gentry Zhang Yi and Pan Shengnian and others believe that the existing barracks and public places in Suzhou have long been stationed with military police and disabled soldiers. After the troops belonging to the 60th Division came to Suzhou, there were no more houses left. They are deeply afraid that there will be no place to accommodate them after they arrive in Suzhou. Therefore, on the 27th, they telegraphed Chen Mingshu, the commander of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison, requesting that he consider the extremely difficult situation in Suzhou and choose another suitable location for relocation. Otherwise, they also requested that the number of people be reduced as much as possible.</p>
<p>A Murdered Male Corpse Was Found Outside Panmen: A male corpse was found in the river at the Guangji Bridge mound outside Panmen on the 26th. He was about 40 years old, wearing a white undershirt on his upper body and completely naked on his lower body. His head had been chopped off, and only a few pieces of skin and flesh were still connected. It appeared to be an abandoned corpse killed due to a love affair. After the local procuratorate sent personnel to examine it, they ordered the local security to prepare a coffin for burial and sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to arrest the murderer. However, as of the evening of the 27th, no relatives of the deceased had arrived, and there were no clues to the case.</p>

<p>The Entire Money Industry Was Stimulated to Suspend Business: The County Court Procuratorate, at 9:00 p.m. on the 6th of this month, acting on a secret report, searched the home of Fan Chunchen, the owner of the Defeng Money Shop on Dongda Street, for opium. Fan was arrested and taken to the court, where the criminal judge Liang Xuan sentenced him to one month in prison and a fine of 600 yuan. At that time, Fan asked for permission to pay the fine first due to old age and illness, and he was temporarily released on bail. Recently, the Procuratorate approved the Criminal Court of the same court to send the Fan case for execution. At 9:00 a.m. on the 26th, it appointed Prosecutor Du Jiasheng to lead the bailiffs to Fan Chunchen's home to arrest him. Fan happened to be seriously ill and living in Tongren Hospital. Du and others immediately rushed to Tongren Hospital and arrested Fan and took him to the court. At the same time, Prosecutor Yang An was also sent to lead bailiffs Li Renzhen and Li Changqing to search the Defeng Money Shop opened by Fan Chunchen. They suddenly entered the silver room. When the shop saw that Yang was in plain clothes and Li and others were bald and wearing short black clothes, they asked what was happening, but they only said that they had official business and did not say their names, and they were in a hurry. They feared that they were bandits disguised as officials, so they blew the whistle and sounded the alarm. The merchant group patrol team and others went to rescue them. The neighbors around were suspicious of robbery and were extremely panicked. The order was disrupted for a time, and more and more people gathered in the street. When Yang and others realized that it was a misunderstanding, they came out proudly. The crowd did not know that they were judges and suspected that they were bandits, so they shouted loudly. Fortunately, Wang Changsheng, the captain of the merchant group patrol team, feared that an incident would occur and took Yang and others to the nearby Chamber of Commerce to inquire. Yang then said that he was a prosecutor of the court and was ordered to search Defeng and showed his search warrant in his arms. At that time, Prosecutor Du had also arrived, saying that the shop refused to be inspected and caused a dispute, and should be severely punished. After returning to the court, he immediately reported to the Chief Prosecutor Zhou Erkai and telegraphed the situation to the High Court. The Money Industry Association also convened an emergency meeting, believing that the current situation was unstable and that bandits often impersonated officials to search and rob. The case of the Jiangsu Bank robbery in broad daylight the year before could serve as a lesson. In today's Defeng case, Prosecutor Yang did not state his name or the details of the case in advance, and suddenly entered the silver room for inspection, which was enough to make the industry feel cold. They must seek official guarantees for their business in order to ensure safety. It was unanimously decided to suspend business on the 27th and wait for a solution. That night, they also telegraphed the High Court, requesting that Yang An be dismissed. At the same time, they submitted petitions to the county government and the court, requesting relief. Yesterday (27th), all 18 money shops in the city suspended business. The County Chamber of Commerce, as well as China, Communications, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Industry, Continent, Farmers, and other banks, also urgently telegraphed the High Court, requesting a prompt and fair trial to protect the commercial market and maintain the rule of law. County Magistrate Chen Hua and the Director of the Public Security Bureau also invited Yang, the President of the County Court, and the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce to persuade the money industry to resume business immediately and wait for a solution to maintain the market.</p>
<p>Gamblers Refuse Arrest and Beat Police: According to a secret report from the County Government, there were gambling activities in Shitangwan. It immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to send police to the countryside to investigate and arrest. More than 30 gamblers were arrested in the two gambling dens, Huifang Garden opened by Qin Afa and the home of Liu Asan. At that time, the gamblers were engrossed in gambling. When they saw the police arrive, they relied on their numbers and shouted loudly, and removed the wooden bridges before and after the town. Some policemen were beaten into the river, and some had their uniforms torn.

<p>Shanghai Detectives Arrive in Cheng to Arrest Buyers of Stolen Goods: In August of this year, the Texaco Company of the United States hired Xu Shaoqing and Li Changsheng, boatmen from Yancheng, through Qian Mingrong, the owner of the shipping company, to transport 1,000 boxes of Xingfu brand kerosene to the Hangzhou Zhakou branch for unloading. Unexpectedly, the boatmen transported the kerosene to Jiangyin and secretly contacted Fan Guijin from Jingjiang, selling 500 boxes to Yuan Taichang outside the North Gate (two boxes were later returned), agreeing on a price of 5 yuan and 5 jiao per box (the original price was 9 yuan and 7 jiao and a half). Fan received a commission of one silver yuan per box, and paid 1,250 yuan at the time, agreeing to pay 500 yuan on the 15th of the lunar October and 1,000 yuan on the 10th of the lunar December. The kerosene had been sold. The remaining 500 boxes were sold to a certain place in Huangdu. After receiving a letter from Zhakou, the company learned of the situation and reported it to Chen Xizeng, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, who sent Detective Captain Lu Ying to arrest the boatman Xu Shaoqing. Yesterday (26th), a formal document was sent to the county government, and detectives Chen Caifu, Zhao Huairen, Wang Xingao, and others were sent to the county government to submit the document and arrest Yang Qiming, the owner of Yuan Taichang, and Fan Guijin, the introducer. Many empty kerosene boxes were seized. Wu, the auditing officer, clarified the case in the evening. As the case still required investigation, he refused to take the suspects to Shanghai. The Chamber of Commerce defended Yang for mistakenly buying stolen goods. The court ordered him to be released on bail. The detectives returned to Shanghai on the 27th to report.</p>

<p>Dissemination of Comparative Status Reports on Literacy Campaigns Already Held in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Nanjing</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education distributed a booklet comparing the literacy campaign propaganda held in the three provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Nanjing, and issued a notice to the education departments of the provinces and cities that had not yet submitted reports, stating that literacy campaigns are of great importance. The Ministry has long formulated and promulgated the "Outline of the Literacy Campaign Propaganda Plan" for implementation. In recent years, many provinces and cities have followed the outline and actively promoted it. Among them, the three provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Nanjing have achieved the most remarkable results. Jiangsu Province's detailed planning and diligent implementation are particularly commendable. In order to facilitate reference by various provinces and cities, we have compiled a comparison of the literacy campaign propaganda held in the three provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Nanjing based on the original reports submitted by the three provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Nanjing in previous years. It is printed into a special booklet and distributed with this order. We hope that provinces and cities that have already organized and achieved results will continue to work hard on the existing foundation to ensure the early success of the literacy campaign and become a model for the whole country. Those provinces and cities that have not yet submitted reports or organized campaigns should refer to the items listed in the booklet and organize them immediately to promote progress. After the campaign is organized, you should submit the most recent information on the organization and specific plans for assessment as soon as possible. This is of utmost importance. This order.</p>

<p>Telegram to the Delegation: National Central University in Nanjing forward to the gentlemen of the student delegation urging the government to send troops from Shanghai universities. This trip is a heavy responsibility. Be sure to embrace the spirit of great fearlessness and the determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats. Firmly demand clear answers from the government on two points: whether it is determined to send troops and whether there are concrete measures to severely punish derelict officials. Ask for a definite explanation for why Ma Zhanshan is not being aided and why the people are being forbidden from petitioning. Aside from this, do not ask about anything else, and be especially careful not to arbitrarily add to or subtract from the original positions, exceeding the basic principles and scope. Upon the government's issuance of a concrete reply, immediately report by telegram and await the association's decision on the standard for returning or staying. We have heard that someone named Zhu insulted the delegation. Please provide details of the facts. Shanghai Universities Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association, respectfully.</p>
<p>Telegram to the National Government: Chairman Chiang of the National Government in Nanjing, for your perusal.

We are extremely anxious and apprehensive. The entire student body of National Labor University respectfully.</p>

Roll call will be taken at 7:45 AM, and the departure will be at 8:00 AM, starting from the intersection of Changde Road and Jing'an Temple Road, passing through Jisi Fei Road, Bailinan Road, crossing the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, along Suzhou River to Beixinjing, entering Luo Biegen Road, turning back to Hongqiao Road, Haige Road, Xiafei Road, Lafayette Road, Albert Road, Fuxi Road, Tongfu Road, Weihaiwei Road, and heading straight to the entrance of the racecourse on Ma Huo Road.

<p>-- Swallow</p>
<p>The Japanese pirates of Jiaqing in the Ming Dynasty. What is recorded in the historical records is only the general outline. The notes of various families have also failed to detail them. The Zhou family of Fengxian were descendants of Lord Zhongjian of the Song Dynasty. They lived as a clan, numbering about hundreds of households. Among them was General Zhou Yongwei, whose residence, Jiawei, had assets worth millions of gold. The elegance of the garden and cups was unparalleled at the time. When the Japanese pirates invaded Puzuo, they burned his garden. Zhou was so grieved and indignant that he destroyed his family to relieve the disaster, gathering local militias and training them into elite troops day and night. The following year, the Japanese pirates came again. Zhou invited them to fight, and countless were killed. The Japanese pirates retreated in defeat, hoisting their sails and leaving. Zhou anticipated that they would come for revenge, so he built defensive fortresses everywhere and guarded them day and night. Qi Jiguang reported his war performance to the court. By imperial decree, he was conferred the title of General Yongwei and subordinated to Qi's command. Thus, the troops were well-equipped and trained more diligently. Before long, the Japanese pirates indeed invaded in large numbers. Qi and Zhou ambushed them at Jinshan Hui and the Huijie area, capturing and beheading the Japanese chieftain. From then on, the Japanese pirates dared not cross the Lei Pond one step. Critics all said that Zhou's war achievements, although initially motivated by righteous indignation, would not have been known or recorded without Qi Jiguang's commendation. Compared with the present time, when General Ma is fighting alone with loyalty and bloodshed and no one comes to his aid, the difference is incalculable. I humbly hope that the authorities will rise up like General Qi and not let their ambition fall.</p>
<p>Chatting in the Studio Where the Weeds are Not Removed -- By Zhai Fu</p>
<h3 id="e94">The Process of Starving to Death <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>This year's flood victims, according to the Water Disaster Relief Committee, numbered as many as 50 million, and those who starved to death were counted in the millions. The inaugural issue of Anhui Disaster Weekly contains an article by He Ming describing the process of "starving" to "death," which is unbearable to read. But it is necessary to present it to the people of the country, hoping that those who have food to eat during this national crisis will not forget the compatriots in the flood-stricken areas who have no food to eat. He Yiming's report is:</p>
<p>"The process of 'starving' to 'death' is very simple. First, the body becomes weak and can still speak in a low voice. Further on, one can no longer speak, but the legs can still move. At this stage, if one falls asleep peacefully and does not move, one can prolong the agony for quite some time. If there is an ignorant son or daughter crying for food beside you, or if you can't bear to see your children starve in the same way, and you try to crawl elsewhere to get something for your children to eat, then as soon as you exert yourself, a stream of yellow water will flow from your mouth, and your body will fall to the ground with this stream of yellow water, never to move again. Every person who starves to death inevitably has to emit this stream of yellow water; every person who emits yellow water due to starvation inevitably dies instantly. Yellow water, it is forever imprinted in my mind!"</p>
<h3 id="e95">Wu Zhilao's Personal Humiliation by the Japanese <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui, a prominent figure in the Party-State, was unconventional and carefree. His morality and wit were beyond the reach of ordinary people. He was truly the Dongfang Manqian of the Republic of China era. Mr. Wu admired simplicity and frugality, not caring about his attire. He would walk through the streets. I still remember one evening this summer, I saw him strolling leisurely on Nanjing Road, appearing very relaxed, probably taking a walk after dinner. Suddenly, two or three playful young people on the left side of the road, who also recognized Mr. Wu, called out "Wu Zhihui" in strange voices repeatedly. Mr. Wu, hearing the voices, suspected they were violent people who might be harmful to him. He immediately rushed into a nearby fruit and snack shop, using the purchase of food as an excuse to avoid them. It was wise to protect himself, which was reasonable. He loved reading tabloids and supplements in various newspapers, often selecting and buying them from newsstands. In his early years, he also enjoyed writing fictional stories. The book "Talking About Ancient and Modern Times" was a monumental work that used the format of a novel to expound on scientific principles. He was skilled at creating楹聯 (楹聯 a pair of scrolls with antithetical sentences, usually displayed on both sides of a doorway). Those who sought them were numerous and insistent, which Mr. Wu found troublesome. He once described his own calligraphy as "dog scratches and cat footprints," defiling white paper. Such was his humor and humility. This time, with the Japanese acting recklessly, Mr. Wu felt particularly indignant. A guest who knew some of his anecdotes said that years ago, when Mr. Wu was traveling in Japan, he had personally suffered humiliation from the Japanese. When he was tipsy, he would often talk about it himself. It happened in the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (the thirty-fifth year of Meiji in Japan). Mr. Wu and Mr. Sun Bojun strongly requested the ambassador to send students to study at public schools. This incurred the jealousy and anger of the authorities. The Japanese police department then deported Mr. Wu and Mr. Sun back to their hometowns to humiliate them. After Mr. Wu was arrested, he believed that a scholar could be killed but not humiliated. He wanted to awaken the masses through his death. Thus, when the police officers were escorting him out of the country, he jumped into the river to join Qu Yuan (a famous Chinese poet who drowned himself in a river). Fortunately, he was rescued. A friend found a letter in his clothes with the words "His words are good" on the cover. The letter inside read: "Believe in it unto death, make it clear not to be a traitor. Civil rights and freedom, the law of the nation. Cutting hair for innovation, a single word can decide. Use the corpse as remonstrance, worry about the crooked chimney. Alas, how sorrowful! What does the ambassador have to do with it? Confucius said to achieve benevolence, Mencius said to take righteousness. The misery of national demise will be like this. Gentlemen, work hard. I will never die." The words were passionate and慷慨 (kāng kǎi, deeply moved), comparable to Wen Tianxiang's "Song of Righteousness," both shining brightly through the ages.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Notes on Overseas Current Affairs Cartoons Seen <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>The invading Japanese army has invaded our Northeast Three Provinces, forcibly occupying land and massacring our people. The situation is serious and has shocked the world. Therefore, many magazines sent from Europe and the United States mention the Sino-Japanese incident. There are also some cartoons that subtly satirize it. After flipping through them, I will briefly describe one or two to show the observations of overseas people on the Japanese military annexation, which are quite different.</p>
<p>Last month's British women's magazine had a cartoon depicting an Eastern man and a Chinese woman standing side by side, looking like a quarreling couple. In the middle is a child, with the words "South Manchurian Railway" written on it, looking like he is covering his face and crying. Behind the Chinese woman is another woman, referring to Russia, implying support. The display of the picture is like this. Whether it is reasonable, the readers can probably see it. The Japanese army is not acting this time for the South Manchurian Railway; in fact, it wants to annex our country by force. Our country is united from top to bottom, sharing the same hatred of the enemy. Justice still exists, and there will eventually be a day of victory. There is no need for Russian help, and Russia may not be able to help us. If the Northeast Three Provinces incident can be compared to a couple's quarrel, and the South Manchurian Railway is regarded as a child between the two parties, it is even more inconsistent with the facts and reason.</p>
<p>The American "Mirror" newspaper has also recently published a cartoon, depicting two children fighting to light firecrackers. On the firecrackers is labeled "World War." Americans already know that the Northeast Three Provinces incident cannot be resolved satisfactorily and may lead to a world war. But they also know that our country did not want to set off this terrible firecracker, and tried its best to avoid its ignition. If unfortunately it explodes, it will be the Japanese who light it with fire. Therefore, saying that Chinese people and Japanese people are fighting to set off the firecrackers of World War is not as reasonable as saying that the Japanese set it off alone.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Anti-Japanese Hero Jian Dashī <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Wang Junfang</p>
<p>I remember years ago, I read Mr. Shoujuan's small book "Violet Flowers" at a friend's place. There was an article in it describing the anti-Japanese experiences of the Taiwanese hero Jian Dashi. His heroism and greatness are enough to inspire our people to fight for the country. Now I will describe what I can remember to encourage the people of the country.</p>
<p>In the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, our country was defeated by Japan. Japan wanted to obtain the Northeast Three Provinces, but Li Hongzhang resisted it strongly without success. In the end, Taiwan was ceded for peace. At that time, the Taiwanese people heard of this and rose up in opposition, repeatedly appealing to the Qing court without success. Among the major clans in Taiwan, there was a person named Jian Dashi, who was not well-read but was naturally chivalrous and quite popular. He heard that the Qing court was about to hand over Taiwan, and angrily said, "Is it not possible to resist with force? Those who are noisy and like to be superior to others in peacetime are afraid when things happen, they are not real men." Those who heard his words were all moved and united, vowing to resist Japan to the death. Dashi then summoned his comrades and joined the Black Flag Army Liu Yongfu to actively prepare for war. When Japanese warships came to attack, they triggered a water mine and were lost, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers. The Taiwanese people cheered and the sound shook the sky. Japan dispatched more than forty armored cruisers from across the country, and besieged them again. Dashi led the strong men in a bitter battle, and drove women to farm, holding out for many years without running out of food. Later, due to insufficient ammunition, he took money across the Min River to purchase military supplies to replenish it. However, most of it was captured by the Japanese, or sent by Chinese officials tied up on Japanese warships to curry favor with the enemy. Thus, there was no way to hold out. They held on until after August of the tenth month when Taiwan fell. However, there were still street battles for several days. When strength was exhausted and support was cut off, he disguised himself and fled to the Min River, thinking of making another attempt. Unfortunately, he was betrayed by a friend, and the Min official tied him up and sent him to Taiwan. The Japanese imposed extreme punishment on him. When he was executed, Taiwanese people left their houses to watch. They saw their anti-Japanese leader's intestines flow out and blood fly, and everyone lowered their heads and wept, unable to bear to watch. After that, the Taiwanese people gave up the idea of ​​restoring their homeland and fell into slavery. I remember that Dashi used the small land of Taiwan to resist the national army of Japan for more than a year without surrendering. Although Taiwan was lost, it cannot be said that there was no one. Compared to the Battle of the Yellow Sea, Japan lost our Beiyang Fleet in just one day, which is even more heroic for Dashi.</p>
<p>Short News: Calligrapher Zhang Zhenlü grieves that General Ma Zhanshan's isolated army has been lost, and still inspires the patriotic spirit of a Confucian scholar. He donates paper and ink to write couplets to raise money to support his counterattack. Anyone who donates more than one yuan or more will be given a five-foot couplet. It is handled by the North Army Road Liangchen Hao Youshe (a friendly society). There is a declaration printed, with slogans such as "Devote yourself to the cause until death, what harm is there in breaking your wrist? Wielding a pen is as good as facing a thousand soldiers. Gathering bits of fur makes a strong fortress," "See the unanimous approval of the people and their virtues, and lead the government's deployment of troops," etc. It is very passionate and righteous. There will probably be many sympathizers.</p>

<p>— Tian You</p>
<p>When the Treaty of Shimonoseki was concluded, our country ceded Taiwan to Japan. The Taiwanese people strongly opposed it, so they organized a republic and elected Governor Tang Jingsong as president to resist Japan. That was a dramatic act with sound and color. The passionate and heroic situation is written so vividly that you can see it.</p>
<p>"The drums rumble loudly on the city wall. "Heaven, Heaven!! Tears fall like rain!! The Japanese are actually ceding Taiwan away. In the beginning, the territory was included in the treasure house of heaven. Heaven felt it from afar and reached the land where the sun rises. My great-grandfather, grandfather, and father killed the weeds and came to this land. Sugar, tea, and snow, thousands of billions of trees. Annual taxes, countless gold and money. Why does Heaven abandon me? Why is Heaven angry? Taking my fat and ointment to share with the enemy. That greedy and insatiable rat. What crime have the people committed to suffer this hardship? Who destroyed Qin? Three households of Chu. What's more, there are millions of households in Fujian and Guangdong. Everyone will fight to the death and swear to resist. With the unity of all the people, who dares to insult us? Success or failure, benefit or harm is not what we see."</p>
<p>With a shout, he drew his sword and struck the pillar. "There is nothing else to say today. Whoever does not obey, I will kill you with my own hands."</p>
<p>The glorious blue flag stands with a yellow tiger. The whole city crowds to watch, the streets empty and dancing. A golden,斗大 (斗大 dǒu dà, as big as a dou (a unit of dry measure)) seal is tied with a rope. They directly call the governor the president. "Today's government is for the people. Tainan and Taipei are our strongholds. Do not step over the雷池 (léi chí, Lei Chi, a forbidden area)."</p>
<p>The above is the enthusiastic anti-Japanese situation within five minutes. The following describes the result.</p>
<p>"The wind howls angrily in Haicheng in May. Three hundred golden-winged ships fly here. Pursuing the giant ships like a tide. Those who land first are fierce tigers. Those who seize the pass later are flying monkeys. The guns and Bizen knives in front of the village. They are defeated and the blood flows. The gods are burned and the ghosts are rotten, the city gate burns. Who will fight and defend? Who can escape?"</p>
<p>"A round of red sun is high in the sky. Thousands of white flags flutter in the wind. The gentry and elders invite each other. Kneeling on both sides of the road, bowing and bowing. Red tassels, bamboo hats, brocade scarves. Green silk braids hanging down like clouds. Kneeling and holding a silver plate with tea and pastries. Silk-embroidered gourds and purple grapes. "General, you have come from afar, you must be tired. The surrendered people respectfully treat the general." The general said, "Come, call your Cao. You and I are of the same race and originally compatriots. Koxinga was a hero among men. He opened up this land to divide the茅 (máo, weeds). Today, return me to the Tianshi sect. The country is as benevolent and holy as Yao. Nurturing you and educating you are different from the Li Miao. Secure your homes and families, no quarrels."</p>
<p>The general walked slowly, the dust did not disturb. Ten thousand horses entered the city, the wind whistling. Alas, the general is not a heavenly pride. The power of the royal army is all-encompassing. We place our lives in the hands of the general. How dare we not return to the enlightened and holy dynasty?"</p>
<p>At that time, with all of China fighting against Japan, there was still the defeat of the Jiawu year. It was originally an extremely difficult thing to resist Japan with Taiwan Province alone. But the enthusiasm of the previous day and the listless surrender of today is too embarrassing. Therefore, Gongdu sighed and ended the story.</p>
<p>"Alas, oh! How sad! All of you in Taiwan. Why were you so loyal and brave yesterday, and so cowardly today? Everything is fickle and changes with the blink of an eye. There is no preparation for war and defense in peacetime. Loyalty and righteousness are unreliable."</p>

<h3 id="e100">A Country Bumpkin Comes to Shanghai Again (30) <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>But he felt something was strange: it was not yet very late, about seven or eight o'clock, why were the night watchmen already out? Or because the times were bad, there was a curfew early on, and pedestrians had to be cut off at eight or nine o'clock, so the watchmen naturally had to come out. But I heard that Shanghai was the safest place, so when the mainland encountered turmoil, everyone ran to Shanghai. Could it be that I have come to Shanghai with difficulty, and I am encountering a curfew period again?</p>
<p>He looked closely and felt even more wrong. Why are these watchmen young, and there are even very young and beautiful women among them? Of course, these can only be called watchwomen, and can no longer be called watchmen. Or have the old watchmen been unable to strike the watch, and passed it on to their children? The watchmen who strike the watch also hold a small flag in their hands, which is a very novel trick.</p>
<p>They gradually walked from that table to this table.</p>
<p>"Since they are striking the watch, they should strike it on the road, why are they walking into the house?" The country bumpkin was even more puzzled.</p>
<p>They stepped forward, first bowed to the country bumpkin, and then gave him a flyer-like piece of paper. There were many words on the paper, and although the country bumpkin also knew a few words, he did not dare to look at the flyer. Don't look at him as a coarse person, he is also careful in his coarseness. Someone once told him: "Shanghai is the most dangerous place. If someone gives you a piece of paper when you are walking on the road, you must not take it. Because there are often communists and reactionaries spreading leaflets there. The person who distributes the leaflets knows that they are dangerous goods and runs away quickly. You take his leaflet, and you don't even know what is written on it? The detectives see you holding the leaflet in your hand, and they will arrest you. I heard that a country bumpkin came and was walking on the road, and saw a newspaper on the ground. He picked it up and thought it was very clean, and it would be useful to wrap his shoes. So he wrapped a pair of broken shoes in the newspaper and went to the train station, but was detained by the police, who said that he was carrying contraband. He couldn't figure out what the contraband was? Who knew that the newspaper wrapping the shoes was a reactionary newspaper. The country bumpkin couldn't figure out what a reactionary was, but he suffered in court." In this situation, people regard Shanghai as a dangerous abyss.</p>
<p>Now the country bumpkin sees the watchmen also handing out flyer-like pieces of paper, and he remembers the story that people told him, and he no longer dares to look at it.</p>
<p>"Sir! We are all students in the school, out to solicit donations for flood relief. Please look at the faces of the flood victims and donate some money. No matter how much, it is good." The two students who were soliciting donations for flood relief for the first time spoke very gently.</p>

<p>Gold Price Drops Nine Taels</p>
<p>Large Fluctuations with a Difference of Over Twenty Taels. Yesterday, the price of gold suddenly showed signs of weakness, changing rapidly and with great volatility. There was a difference of as much as twenty taels between the morning and evening, causing panic. In the end, the calculated drop was around nine taels. Most of the damage was to internal transactions. The initial market was relatively stable, slightly rising, and unaffected by external news. However, due to the weakening of foreign exchange rates, it tended to soften, fluctuating around 70 taels. At noon, bad news suddenly spread that the situation in the north was deteriorating, with rumors of Jinzhou being in danger. This further weakened the market. Later, the market suddenly broke through 660 taels, with selling pressure surging, almost like a river flowing downwards. Foreign exchange bills also became scarce, and Indian rupee telegraphic transfers also rose. However, buyers appeared to be more active later, and the falling trend subsided, and it recovered to over 60 taels. In short, the chaotic state makes it difficult to predict the trend.</p>
<p>The Morning Market is Still Flat, Before the Closing Plunge. The market opened slightly higher by 1.8 taels, at 673.5 taels. Large bars rose by only one-eighth. American banks were closed for holidays and there was no telegraph. Buyers were relentless and the price rose to 75 taels. However, Yuanmao, Yongheng, Changyong, Fushunli, Wanxing, etc. were selling, and British gold banks initially entered at 75, but then settled. The US dollar was also doing 32.6875 yuan, and the price of gold fell by 7 taels. There was a fluctuation of 2 taels in a moment, until the British gold announcement released 25 basis points, and it became 66.5 taels. However, the US dollar did not change, and retail investors bought in, rising by 2 taels to 68.8 yuan. Soon after, Yongfeng, Hengyu, Yuanheng, Hongkangyong, and the Dalian bank still had sales, so the price fell back by more than 2 taels, and the US dollar was even stronger, doing 9375. Then 10 pence could be settled, and the US dollar was still difficult to sell at 33 yuan, causing the gold price to fall again by 2 taels, and it was 64.5 taels at 10 o'clock. Banks absorbed British gold at 10 pence, and Zhejiang sold to HSBC at 32.875 to 8125 yuan, and it immediately rose by 5 or 6 taels, and it was 70 taels at 10:20. After entering, it saw another downstream, and Hengxing, Neixing, Yifengyong, etc. sold out. After 10:30, it was 66.5 taels. In just over ten minutes, it was pulled up by 3 taels, followed by a heavy drop. Because the recent US dollar was 875, it could be entered and exited, and British gold was 19.9375. Indian rupee telegraphic transfers were also released by 5 annas. Dachencheng, Hengchangyong, Yuanmao, Yongshunli, Wanxing, etc. competed to sell, so it fell by another 4 or 5 taels, and it was 65 taels at noon. Then it closed at 5.3 taels. At this time, it was suddenly heard that Jinzhou was in danger, and the market suddenly became crazy, and it was cut by 4 or 5 taels, and finally it was about 61 taels. The quoted price was still calculated at 768 taels, a discount of over 100 taels.</p>
<p>The Market is Very Bullish, the Market Turns Straight Down. The opening in the afternoon was only counted as 57.5 taels, but the physicals opened small, and the remaining momentum from the afternoon had not dissipated. Next was 59 taels to 56.5 taels. Dalian sold relentlessly. Suddenly, Yuanmao, Yonggan, Changxiang, Daxingyong, etc. bought in, and Youli Mitsui absorbed the March US dollar at 33.25 yuan, Shanghai absorbed 125, and bought British gold at 10 pence 125, so it increased to 61 taels. Before long, it was suddenly heard that Mumbai was up another 8 annas. In a moment, the storm rose greatly, and the sellers were also strong. It泻 xiè (xiè, to leak) by more than 6 taels, and at 2:30, it was 54.5 taels, with a momentum of disintegration. Then, Zhifengyong, Hongkangyong, Hengyu Richang and zero households and short sellers bought in. At 3:30, it was 61.8 yuan. Physicals came out again, suppressing it by another 2 taels. Around 4 o'clock, it was 59 taels. Mumbai did not change, and the market was flat. Wanxing Shunli Hengyu and the general stalls and 7 retail investors all had hands and entered. HSBC bought US dollars at 125, so it raised it by more than 4 taels again. At 4:10, it was 63.7 taels. Physicals came out again, and it fell back to 60.5 taels. At 4:30, the closing was rushed to 62.8 taels. Unexpectedly, Yuanmao Yongtong Taichang, etc. came to sell again, continuing to do it to about 61 taels. Compared with the previous day (according to the listing), it fell by 8.9 yuan. According to the highest of 75 taels and the lowest of 54.5 taels in the morning, there was a difference of 20.05 taels, which can be said to be huge. Physicals were 75 taels in the morning market, 61 taels at noon, 58 taels in the afternoon, and 62.5 taels at the close. The quoted price was a discount of 110 taels to 105 taels.

<p>January Futures of the 21st Year to Be Opened Today</p>

Only about 10 million yuan of bonds were actually delivered yesterday. The delivery volume of the 1921 Customs Bonds reached 5.4 million yuan, the Consolidated Tax Bonds 3.51 million yuan, and the Salt Tax Bonds and the 1920 Customs Bonds only 2.67 million yuan each.

<p>Yarn Market Selling Pressure Very Strong</p>
<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and fell in the afternoon, with a very weak trend. Due to the many national affairs and the increasingly urgent silver price, rumors spread in the afternoon that the violent Japanese were causing serious disturbances in Tianjin, causing people to become more anxious. The selling pressure was strong, and the decline was even more severe, but the distant months were still flat.</p>
<p>Human Brand Down One or Two Taels</p>
<p>The opening of the Human Brand market in the morning was flat due to the closure of the American cotton market. It rose by one cent in the near term and fell by three cents in the distant term. In the afternoon, news from Tianjin was unfavorable, with the near month falling by one tael and five cents and the distant month falling by four cents. The total trading volume for the day was 33,600 bales. The sales of Changfeng were 1,350 bales, Deji 1,500 bales, Taixing 2,150 bales, Yiyu 1,000 bales, and Xincheng 1,000 bales.

<p>The cotton market was very weak and unstable. Foreign cotton was flat, Indian cotton was trending down, and the price of cotton in Hankou fell by two yuan. The supply gradually became smooth. Various factories had already purchased sufficient quantities of both Indian and American cotton, and their capacity was full. As a result, spot traders had a rather unstable attitude, and the market trend was deteriorating. If American cotton falls further, it will be difficult to maintain the 30-tael level for standard cotton.</p>
<p>Near-Term Hankou Standard Down Two Cents</p>
<p>The Hankou Standard market opened in the morning with the American cotton market closed and Indian cotton falling sharply. The market sentiment softened. The middle month rose by five cents.

<p>Overcast Weather Stabilizes Rice Market</p>
<p>Nantou: Yesterday, the arrival of goods by various groups became increasingly scarce. The inventory in the ports was slightly available, and the inventory in urban and rural stores was still low. Due to the weather, there was a slight movement in the intention to bring in fresh goods, and the market also felt slightly open. Because of the continuous telegram reports from inland areas, Shanghai merchants were unwilling to drop prices further. The high-quality goods in the Xixin market were firm, and ordinary goods were also temporarily stable. The early Bo Erdao rice had little inventory. Transactions with merchants and the local city were light, and the market trend was tired. Although there were households hoarding Du Yangjian rice, the quantity was limited. Nuomi rice was affected by the tired merchant market and only top-quality goods moved slightly. Secondary goods were sluggish, and the situation continued to decline.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, about 30 ships arrived with goods. Due to the light rain, the number of people in the market in the morning was not very enthusiastic. The market for thick new japonica rice was stable, and high-quality goods were particularly stable. Secondary goods in stores were active, and both buyers and sellers sold off as the market moved. Demand for thin Erdao rice was still good, and it was mentioned that near-port and foreign-style rice were temporarily halted. Buyers did not pay much attention to it, and the price continued to rise. Bian Yin Yuan was sold as soon as it arrived, and the market was high and tight. Secondary goods were stable, and Du Jian was weak, falling by five cents.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Foreign Rice Trading Stagnates <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was already in a state of stagnation. Although foreign firms were taking advantage of the falling gold price to peddle futures for various months, buyers were watching and there were no transactions for many days. Since the local streets had been clearing goods smoothly for several days, there were more fixed orders arriving in Shanghai, so there were plans to push for further imports, but the owners were unwilling to sell lightly due to the high cost. Moreover, the current inventory was not very congested, and some hoarders were directly transferring goods in, so there was not much floating inventory in the market. Once the major merchant groups cleared the goods, the market could immediately turn around, so there were plans to persist and wait for a good price. Since the market had already been held up by both sides, it presented a stagnant situation.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Flour Sales Suffer Another Blow <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Customer Groups Returning Goods... Heavy Fatigue</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month initially showed fatigue and then became lively. Initially, the price of foreign wheat was lowered by 3-4 jiao, and people felt at ease. Then, because a certain small factory and a large factory slightly replenished the near term, and the customer groups purchased spot goods, the soft market became lively. The near month was good by 1.5 fen, and the distant month was good by 1 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, the news from the north turned dangerous again, and the customer groups were returning goods. Moreover, the gold market fell heavily, and the trend was not good. This caused most people to feel bad again. Considering that the silver market was still extremely tight and the current situation was difficult to be optimistic about, there was little hope for a good future. As a result, the months from this month to March were down by 7.5 li, and April was down by 5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Wheat Prices Fall Sharply <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, the market for each month was quoted lower by 3-4 jiao. People inside and outside the industry were watching, and transactions were unusually deserted. However, because the ending of this month was not good, the market atmosphere was sluggish. When the market opened in the afternoon, the near and distant terms fell sharply again. Due to the serious situation in the north, flour sales would be hit hard in the future. In addition, the river closure period would also be less than usual, and the demand for wheat would also stagnate. Therefore, people were very tired, and the prices fell sharply. As a result, December fell by 7 fen compared to the previous day, January and February fell by 8 fen each, March fell by 6 fen, and April fell by 3 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Piece Goods <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Greatcoat Cloth Sales Strong, Prices Rising</p>
<p>Recently, the piece goods market has been very sluggish. Sales are stagnant, and prices are also weaker than before. Only greatcoat cloth sales are particularly strong. Customer demand is endless, and the strong market sales are evident. The selling price in foreign clothing stores is around 50 yuan per piece. The wholesale market has seen prices rise accordingly. The prices of Kong Silu Lin, Haohua, Yongji, and other brands have all increased by 2-3 qian per yard. Yesterday, Kong Silu Lin goods were quoted at 7 taels and 5.5 qian, Yongji at 7 taels and 1.5 qian, and Haohua at 6 taels and 5-6 qian.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Raincoat Fabric, Thick and Thin, Equally Weak <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the trend of raincoat fabric has been abnormally sluggish. The prices of both thick and thin goods are weak. Buyers have very little demand, and new orders are being placed at low prices. More goods are arriving next month, resulting in supply exceeding demand. Holders are very willing to cut prices to sell, but customers are not in urgent need of sales and are mostly unwilling to repurchase. Therefore, the market is weakening step by step. Yesterday, single-sided waterproof thick raincoat fabric of various brands was uniformly reduced to 4 taels and 7 qian. Yuanchang blue-gray elephant skin silver checkered thin raincoat fabric was reduced to 3 taels, 1 qian, and 2.5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Sugar Market, Clearing Trend Firm <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports from production areas indicated that Cuba and New York were closed and there were no reports. Java's current sugar prices remained unchanged. Clearing of Dutch sugar transactions in the association market was still scarce. No. 20 granulated white sugar was 10 taels. Both supply and demand were slow. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was 9 taels and 8.5 qian. Reduced Dutch white sugar was 11 taels and 2 qian. Bowl green sugar was 7 taels and 9 qian. All trends were flat. Taikoo transactions were more smooth. B Mark was 11 taels, 5 qian, and 7.5 fen. Transactions were still frequent. HX Mark was 11 taels and 4 qian. HM Mark supply and demand were quite strong, but the market price was very chaotic. The lowest price was 11 taels and 0.05 fen, and the highest was 11 taels, 1 qian, 5 fen to 2 qian. The market inventory was very low, and exports were extremely rare. The market conditions were all beautiful, and there was still a rising trend.</p>
<h3 id="e116">North-South Goods, Dried Lychees Unevenly Weak and Strong <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Dried lychees of the current year were expensive due to the poor production. The market price was higher than usual. Jinshan branches produced in Guangdong were even fewer, so the market image has been standing up to now. Zhongzhuang Yuan branches still require 65-66 taels, because both arrivals and inventory are scarce, and sales are active. However, Zhangzhou Suo Zhuzhi branches, high-quality goods were nearly 600,000, and have gradually weakened. The price has fallen by about 7 taels. There is more inventory, and the market is weaker. Yesterday, the market called for 54 taels for selected goods. The market price of raw goods was inconsistent, and the trend was flat and weak.</p>

<p>Foreign Firm Silk Market Increasingly Lifeless</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm silk market in Shanghai became increasingly lifeless. Due to the changes in foreign exchange rates, there were still few silk telegrams from overseas to Shanghai. The attitude of Chinese silk merchants was also very negative. Yesterday, only Sanxing Jinbai Qianjing bought 10 bales, and Gaobei bought 3 bales of yellow silk. The price was still firm.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Wuxi Shuang Gong Cocoon Transported Over 100 Dan to Shanghai <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Recently, cocoon merchants in Wuxi have been transporting their cocoon stocks to Shanghai due to the tight silver market. Yesterday, the Wuxi-Shanghai passenger train transported another 157 dan of Shuang Gong cocoons to Shanghai to be used as collateral. There are now mainland cargo warehouses.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai foreign firm tea market, Tunxi high-quality Zhenmei green tea, Yingzhuang Xiehe, Jinlong, Tongfu, and other firms were searching and buying with all their might. Chinese tea merchants had little inventory on hand, so their attitude was firm. Yesterday, the entire city traded more than 400 boxes. The top price opened at 115 taels, an increase of 5-6 taels compared to the previous day. The market became increasingly stable.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Metals <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Sales Not Easy to Turn Around for a While</p>
<p>Since the three northeastern provinces were forcibly occupied by the violent Japanese, the route for metal sales has been greatly reduced. The only thing that can barely satisfy the various industries in the market is the Tianjin group. After the last Japanese change in Tianjin, business plummeted. In recent days, the trend has shown signs of improvement. However, the Taikeng Evening Flour disturbance has occurred again, causing panic. Therefore, the hope for Tianjin sales may not be easy to turn around for a while. In this autumn of national affairs and with the extremely tight silver market, the future of metals may have no good hope within the year. The number of transactions yesterday was also small. Although various groups in the Yangtze River inland added equipment, the number was very small. The embellishments of the manufacturers were also limited. Therefore, the situation in the city has no special market conditions to record.</p>

<p>Recently, spot Liujiang white coal is still extremely scarce, and buyers cannot easily obtain it. The selling price is therefore also unusually firm and strong. Yesterday, the market price was 16 taels and 7.5 qian per ton. In addition, the inventory of Stinky Liujiang coal is also not much, but the route is not as large as good Liujiang coal, and the selling price is also very firm. The current price is 12 taels and 5 qian per ton.</p>

<h3 id="e124">After Japanese Troops Bombed Tianjin <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai-Tianjin Transportation Obstructed</p>
<p>Chinese Ships Suspended</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Bombed Chinese Territory in Tianjin Again. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai shipping companies received telegrams from Tianjin warning that Tianjin was in chaos and business had completely stopped. Only the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinming and Xinfeng ships were operating regular services on the Shanghai-North China route. Yesterday, the company's Xinming ship was ordered to go to Japan, and the Xinfeng ship was also temporarily suspended from going to Tianjin. The other shipping companies also sent telegrams to the temporary cargo ships going to North China, stating that if the situation in Tianjin was dangerous, they could stop going and go to other ports to anchor for safety. Those that had not yet departed were stopped. Yesterday, the Shanghai-Tianjin Chinese ships had suspended operations.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Stopped</p>
<p>After the Tianjin chaos occurred, the Shanghai-based Japanese shipping companies Osaka and Nisshin received telegrams from the Japanese authorities in Tianjin, stating that the Japanese ships Chang'an Maru, Henan Maru, Huashan Maru, and others that had arrived in Tianjin had been detained by the Japanese authorities. After the goods and passengers were unloaded, the commercial services were suspended. Goods and passengers were refused boarding. They are currently staying in Tianjin to provide accommodation for Japanese residents in Tianjin, and when necessary, they will be used to transport Japanese residents to Dalian. Japanese ships sailing en route have been escorted by Japanese warships dispatched from Qingdao. Japanese ships in North China are still recklessly colliding.</p>
<p>Goods Interrupted</p>
<p>The time when large quantities of flour, piece goods, and groceries were being transported to North China, yesterday suddenly announced an interruption. Goods from Tianjin to Shanghai had been completely stopped. After the Shanghai export goods were urgently telegraphed to stop shipping by the Tianjin group yesterday, a large number of goods that had been declared but not yet loaded were temporarily stopped from loading yesterday afternoon. Those that had not been declared were temporarily ordered to be stored in the Shanghai warehouse and not shipped. North-south transportation has been severely hit. It is said that the foreign ships that had already departed have used warships to protect them and unloaded the goods into the Tanggu warehouse, unable to directly reach the Zizhu Forest area.</p>
<p>Italian Warship Sailed to Tianjin</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the alarm of Japanese troops disturbing the Chinese territory in Tianjin came to Shanghai, it was also heard that seven Japanese warships sent to Lushun and Qingdao had also gone to Tianjin. Britain and the United States then紛紛調駐紮在劉公島及烟台之戰艦趕赴天津, to protect overseas merchants. The Italian warship Cabot, stationed in Shanghai, left Shanghai yesterday afternoon and sailed to Tianjin to protect Italian residents in Tianjin.</p>

<p>Please Maintain Far East Peace</p>
<p>Washington Chamber of Commerce Has Reply</p>
<p>Working Hard to Eliminate War</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce believes that Japan has occupied Liaoning and Jilin, and is also invading Jiangxi Province. The Far East situation will have serious incidents. It specially telegraphed the US Chamber of Commerce to create public opinion and suggested that the US government adopt effective measures to maintain peace in the Far East. The incoming and outgoing telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce's Telegram: To the United States Washington National Chamber of Commerce, New York Chamber of Commerce, and transferred to all national Chambers of Commerce. Japan's forcible occupation of Liaoning and Jilin has lasted for nearly two months. Not only does it absolutely not withdraw troops, but it has recently captured Heilongjiang and is plotting to attack Jinzhou. The League of Nations initially advised well, but did not have effective sanctions. Recently, it accepted the Japanese investigation proposal and did not mention the withdrawal of troops. The situation is deteriorating. Our people have been petitioning the government. If war is unavoidable, Far East commerce will be in a desperate situation, and international finance will also collapse. I hope your association will create public opinion and urge your government to take effective action to maintain peace in the Far East. I hope to receive a reply. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>New York Chamber of Commerce Reply: To the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce. Your telegram will be submitted to the Chamber of Commerce Joint Meeting within a few days, and the results will be sent to you at that time. New York Chamber of Commerce President Schmerl.</p>
<p>Washington Chamber of Commerce Telegram: To the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce. Received your telegram, and understand the Manchurian matter. I sincerely acknowledge that the problem is a matter of diplomatic policy. What our association can sincerely tell you is that most of our merchants acknowledge the importance of maintaining peace. Our government is working with other governments to eliminate war and seek a peaceful solution. United States National Chamber of Commerce President Studebaker.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Anti-Japanese National Salvation Ten-Man Group Circular Telegram <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Oppose Establishing Neutral Zone</p>
<p>Should Urge League of Nations to Insist on Troop Withdrawal Resolution</p>
<p>Take Effective Sanctions on the Covenant</p>
<p>The Provisional Executive Committee of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Ten-Man Group issued an important circular telegram yesterday, saying (title omitted): Since the Eastern Provinces were occupied, our government has trusted the League of Nations from beginning to end. Hearing that the League of Nations Council had set a deadline of September 30 to order Japan to withdraw its troops, we thought that justice still existed and the covenant could be relied upon. However, today's newspapers reported that the Council had issued the same warnings to both China and Japan, and that our Minister Shi had a proposal to establish a neutral zone between the Chinese and Japanese military garrison areas, with troops from neutral countries responsible for the police affairs in the area to buffer the war. The public was horrified and indescribable. We only know that Japan is not only failing to comply with the League of Nations Council's resolution to withdraw its troops within the time limit, but is also attacking cities and seizing land, committing acts of war everywhere. If justice still exists, the League of Nations Council, in order to uphold the dignity of the covenant, should, in accordance with the provisions of Article 16, Section 2, mobilize the naval and military forces of each member state to deal with the violating country. Instead, it is intimidated by violence, procrastinates, and ignores the covenant of dignity and the unanimous resolution, only wanting to do its best to restrain the weak without harming its own national interests. The grievances of tens of millions of innocent victims in the Eastern Provinces have not been redressed, and can be ignored. What about justice? As long as there is a breath left in our compatriots throughout the country, we should not want the troops of one country to come without the troops of one country withdrawing from our national territory. The name of a neutral zone is established, and the reality is common management. The members of this group take anti-Japanese and national salvation as their mission. We hereby circulate the resolution of the Provisional Committee, wishing all compatriots and groups across the country to unanimously advocate and join forces against Japan. We must know that the day the neutral zone is realized is the day the Eastern Provinces are openly divided. Our people should rise up and urge the League of Nations to insist on its September 30 resolution ordering Japan to withdraw its troops and to take effective sanctions under Article 16 of the Covenant due to Japan's exceeding the deadline. We are at a loss and filled with indignation.</p>

<p>Japanese Conditions for Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>Please National Government Send Troops to Recover Lost Territory</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association sent a telegram to the National Government yesterday, denying the conditions for Japan's troop withdrawal proposed to the League of Nations, and another telegram to the National Government, requesting that troops be sent immediately to recover the lost territory in the Northeast. The two telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram 1: To the National Government. I am shocked by the news that Japan has also proposed conditions for our demand for troop withdrawal in the League of Nations. If a country's territory is occupied by another country, in order to maintain peace, it demands troop withdrawal through diplomatic means. However, the occupying country still intends to use conditions to threaten it. Its destruction of peace, contempt for justice, and violation of the non-war pact have been clearly visible to the public, and the League of Nations will 아私附和. There is no justice in the world. Our people swear not to recognize it. I hope you will telegram Representative Shi to reject it and protect our national rights. Our people are willing to be the backing. I respectfully report and hope to be aware of it. Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association.</p>
<p>Telegram 2: To the National Government. Since the Northeast was occupied by violent Japan, it has passed in an instant for two months. The government's policy of non-resistance and reliance on the League of Nations has failed. The people have been calling for troops, and they are also afraid to speak out. Recently, Japan's ambition to occupy forever has gradually been confirmed. The recovery of lost territory cannot be achieved through diplomacy. There is no justice in the world. It is a policy of force. The people of the whole country are angry and forming volunteer armies, willing to fight to the death. The popular sentiment is available for use. A few days ago, Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang Province resisted the Japanese army with thousands of poorly equipped troops, which is enough to prove it. In the art of war, attacking the heart is the best. The Japanese slaves are becoming more and more arrogant. Our army is now boiling with blood. If it is used in time, it will definitely wipe out the enemy and restore the lost territory. I respectfully report and hope to be aware of it. Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Public Association of Silver and Money Industries <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Pay Attention to the Export of Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Money Industry Association Believes a Ban on Export is Impossible</p>
<p>Banking Association to Discuss in Today's Regular Meeting</p>
<p>Qin Runqing and Lin Kanghou Both Make Statements</p>
<p>The recent unusual tightness of money in this city, along with the large-scale export of silver dollars, has attracted the attention of various sectors. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to prevent this, sent letters to both the silver and money industries, seeking advice on measures. The Money Industry Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has resolved to form an investigation team to thoroughly investigate and advise the Customs Brokers Association not to handle exports to avoid financial panic. The details of the various situations are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Export Situation: The silver dollars in this city are minted by the Hangzhou Mint, producing 360,000 yuan per day, contracted by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and other banks. In recent days, the money supply has been unusually tight. For example, on the 26th, the difference between the morning and afternoon silver exchange rates was more than 2%, whereas normally it is only about 0.25%. The reason is the large-scale export of silver dollars in recent days, while the import of large bars of silver has slightly decreased compared to before. For example, exporting 10,000 silver dollars can earn hundreds of yuan for Chinese exchange firms, and 40 to 50 yuan for banks and money shops. Therefore, the Japanese are using high profits to entice Chinese merchants to absorb silver dollars. To avoid attracting attention, they are first transported to Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai, and then transferred to Dalian and the Northeast. A few Chinese merchants, greedy for small profits, are unaware of their plot and are falling into their trap. If they do not realize this soon, then this city will directly suffer the panic of a shortage of silver dollars, and indirectly, the domestic financial market will be disrupted. It is said that the Japanese are absorbing silver dollars for the purpose of using them in the Northeast and elsewhere to entice bandits to cause trouble.</p>
<p>Money Industry Meeting: The Money Industry Association received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, seeking advice on preventive measures. They then convened a temporary executive committee meeting at the Ningbo Road Association at 1:00 PM. Those present included Pei Yunqing, Wang Juru, Sheng Xiaoshan, Qin Runqing, Wang Bochen, Li Shoushan, Li Jisheng, Yan Junan, and Fu Songnian. After a report by Chairman Qin Runqing, discussions began regarding the case of transporting silver dollars to the North. It was reportedly decided that: (1) The transport of silver dollars by Chinese firms is solely for the purpose of relieving financial panic in other ports and has no other purpose, so an absolute ban on exports is practically impossible; (2) Respond to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's letter for review; (3) Immediately contact the Banking Association to discuss measures.</p>
<p>Qin Runqing's Remarks: A reporter from the Newsound Society visited Qin Runqing, chairman of the Money Industry Association, yesterday and asked for his opinion on the large-scale export of silver dollars. He said that the export of silver dollars is a very common and legitimate business for the silver and money industries. Moreover, the silver dollars transported to Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai this time were purely purchased by Chinese merchants in those areas, with the sole purpose of adjusting the financial situation and no other purpose. Since the Tianjin Incident, people have been panicking, fearing problems with paper money, and are storing silver dollars to prepare for the worst. If the Japanese want to absorb silver dollars, they can simply export them through Japanese banks in this city without having to go through Chinese hands.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou's Remarks: A reporter from the Newsound Society also visited Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, yesterday and asked for his opinion on the export of silver dollars. He said that since the Tianjin Incident, financial panic has arisen in Tianjin. To adjust the situation, the banking community in this city transported over 3 million yuan to the Bank of China in Tianjin, over 1 million yuan to the Bank of Communications, and a total of approximately 5 million yuan to other banks last week, with no other purpose. Moreover, a ban on the export of silver dollars is practically difficult to implement. For example, the recent donations from various sectors to reward General Ma Zhanshan amounted to about one million yuan, all remitted from banks in Shanghai to Harbin, and must be accompanied by the export of silver dollars to adjust the situation; otherwise, financial panic will inevitably occur in Harbin. It is also possible that some wealthy individuals are withdrawing deposits from Shanghai and remitting them to Tianjin, then transferring them to Dalian to exchange for gold coins and deposit them in banks. The Banking Association has received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and has scheduled a detailed discussion at the Association's regular meeting at 2:00 PM tomorrow.</p>
<p>Advice to Stop Transportation: The Shanghai Money Industry Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association issued a notice yesterday stating, "Notice: Since the preparation of this Association, we have received enthusiastic participation from all those with ambition and the approval of the Executive Committee of this industry. Therefore, last night (26th), we held a members' inaugural meeting and resolved to strictly implement the five proposals passed by the 19th regular meeting of the industry and to advise all colleagues to voluntarily stop transporting cash to Dalian, Yantai, Yingkou, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places. This matter concerns national salvation, and we sincerely hope that all colleagues will act in good faith. This is our earnest hope. Sincerely, The Shanghai Money Industry Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, November 27th."</p>

<p>Situation of Boycotting Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Japanese Economist Says Decline Imminent</p>
<p>Will Chinese Merchants Endure the Mockery of "Five-Minute Enthusiasm"?</p>
<p>The North China Daily News' Tokyo correspondent reported on the 15th that the Chinese people's boycott of Japanese goods has dealt a major blow to Japan. According to newspaper reports, Japanese residents in various parts of China, especially those in Shanghai, are on the verge of bankruptcy. It is reported that the Shanghai Bureau of Industry and Commerce is importing Manchester yarn and sheeting to meet the shortage of goods in the market after the boycott of Japanese goods, and various anti-Japanese groups are intensifying their efforts to sever economic and commercial relations with Japan. According to reports here, Japanese goods have been piled up in the warehouses of Nippon Yusen Kaisha alone, totaling 36,500 tons, and it is feared that there will be no hope of shipment in several months. The sharp decline in Japanese goods exported to China can be evidenced by the Asosan Maru, which recently arrived in Shanghai. The ship only carried 150 tons of cargo, all for Japanese merchants. It is said that small Japanese merchants and capitalists in Shanghai have no other choice but bankruptcy. Among the 40 smaller Japanese factories in the area, each employing about 30 workers, no fewer than 33 have been forced to close. Half of the Japanese-owned shops in Shanghai are unable to pay their employees' salaries, and half of the Japanese workers in Shanghai have returned home. It is expected that Japanese-owned yarn factories in China will soon close down. At that time, Chinese workers will no longer be paid severance, which may lead to disputes. There are 40 Japanese-owned yarn factories in China, with a total of 1,655,000 spindles and 13,090 looms, with a total investment of approximately 200,000,000 Japanese yen. Among them, 27 are located in Shanghai, with 1,169,000 spindles and 9,900 looms. Although the major Japanese textile factories in Shanghai have not yet closed down, it is only a matter of time before they cease operations. Several famous Japanese economists predict that the future of the boycott of Japanese goods in Shanghai will be decided within the next one or two months. In the past, the boycott of Japanese goods often subsided when Chinese merchants had used up their stock of Japanese goods. It is now expected that this stock of Japanese goods will also be exhausted in one month or six weeks, at which time there will be a battle between money and patriotism, and the decline or not of the boycott of Japanese goods will be decided at this time. However, according to the opinion of Takayanagi, secretary of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce, this boycott is very well organized, and even if its momentum slightly declines, the overall impact on Japan may not be reduced. At present, trade between Japan and central and southern China has completely stopped, and even in northern China and the Northeast, it has greatly decreased compared to normal.</p>
<h3 id="e130">New Ming Vessel to Japan to Pick Up Overseas Chinese <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Departure Possible in Two Days</p>
<p>New Feng May Not Go Again</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received an order from the Ministry of Communications to dispatch a ship to Japan to pick up overseas Chinese returning home. Commissioner Guo Waifeng selected the New Ming, the fastest vessel, for the trip. If necessary, the New Feng would also sail east. It is now known that there are only over 1,000 overseas Chinese in Kobe, Osaka, Yokohama, and other places who are unable to return home. The New Ming can carry over 1,300 people, so it has been decided that the New Feng will not sail again. The New Ming arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin at 8:00 AM yesterday and docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf in the French Concession. It is scheduled to sail to Yokohama on the 30th. Because the Bureau has never had a wharf in Japan, it sent a letter to the Dalai Shipping Company on Wuma Road yesterday, asking them to serve as the New Ming's Yokohama agent. At the same time, it also sent a letter to the Shanghai branch of Yamashita Kisen Co., Ltd. at 56 Sichuan Road, asking them to hire a pilot. As for food and fuel, everything has been prepared. A special license has also been issued by the Ministry of Communications to the Jianghai Customs. The New Ming is the latest type of vessel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, 270 feet long, with a displacement of 2,133 tons, and a speed of 12 nautical miles per hour.</p>

<p>Sanction Deng Zhonghe</p>
<p>Announcement: Deng Zhonghe is Sabotaging the Patriotic Movement The Anti-Japanese Association issued Announcement No. 19 yesterday, stating: "It has been found that Deng Zhonghe, owner of Daqing Cotton Cloth Store, privately purchases large quantities of Japanese goods from Japanese firms such as Shanghai Nisshin Tomen and Jiangshang Ito factories, and sets up secret agencies at No. 1264 at the intersection of Lafayette Road and Ladu Road, to repackage Japanese goods as domestic goods. He also forges and privately prints the Jianhua factory brand and falsely establishes the name of Fuan Company in Daqing Store to exclusively sell Japanese goods that have been disguised. The evidence from witnesses is conclusive and undeniable. He even dared to falsely accuse the inspectors of this Association of being robbers and reported them to the police for detention by the court, attempting to retaliate. At a time when violent Japan is invading and the country is about to perish, anti-Japanese national salvation is the unanimous desire of all people. This cunning merchant uses various deceptive procedures to disguise Japanese goods as domestic goods and sell them in various ports, sabotaging the patriotic movement and being abandoned by all Chinese people. All our citizens and banks and money shops should uphold their determination to be patriotic and no longer associate with the factories and stores of this treacherous merchant Deng Zhonghe, to show our resolute break. In addition to being separately executed by this Association according to the 15th Executive Committee Meeting, another announcement is hereby published. Please be aware."</p>
<p>Cancellation of Deng Zhonghe's Broker Status The Association also sent a letter to the Brokers' Association of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, stating: "We are writing to inform you that Deng Zhonghe, owner of Daqing Store, who is a yarn and cloth broker in your exchange, specializes in purchasing large quantities of Japanese goods, amounting to three to four thousand bolts per month, from Japanese firms such as Shanghai Nisshin Tomen and Jiangshang Ito factories. He has set up a secret agency at No. 2260 at the intersection of Lafayette Road and Ladu Road to repackage Japanese goods. He also forges and privately prints the Jianhua factory brand and falsely establishes the Fuan Company in Daqing Store as a contact point for selling Japanese goods. This Association has confirmed this through investigation and submitted it to the 15th Executive Committee Meeting for resolution. At this critical time of anti-Japanese tension, this treacherous merchant Deng Zhonghe, blinded by greed, traffics in Japanese goods on a large scale, which has been abandoned by all Chinese people. Moreover, he falsely sets up secret agencies to repackage Japanese goods as domestic goods, deceivingly promoting sales and sabotaging the patriotic movement. He not only loses his personality but also has no conscience. All his deceitful actions are unacceptable to society. In addition to being separately executed and announced, we hereby write to your association to request that you immediately cancel the yarn and cloth broker status of this treacherous merchant Deng Zhonghe to serve as a warning and expect a reply. Sincerely, The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association."</p>

<p>Rickshaw pullers held a city-wide representatives' meeting at the Minsheng Elementary School on Xinza Road yesterday afternoon. Thirty-three representatives from the French Concession, Nanshi, Zhabei, Hudong, and Huxi attended. After the formalities, Shi ChengLin was elected chairman and Bian JiXu was elected recorder. The chairman reported that violent Japan is displaying its military might and seizing our eastern provinces. The Ma army is resisting the enemy but is weak and unable to hold on. The Northeast territory has been completely occupied. Japanese soldiers are rampant on North Sichuan Road and other places in Huxi, harming our working masses. This has happened several times a day. The Municipal Government's Negotiation Office and various agencies have not heard of any significant negotiations. The workers have to unite themselves to relieve their suffering, etc. After the report, Qin Bizhong (also known as Xiao Biedong), a rickshaw puller from Huxi, gave a report: "On the 20th of this month, while pulling a rickshaw passing the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Connaught Road, a group of Japanese soldiers suddenly came and forced me to pull their goods. I, mindful of national shame, refused to pull. The Japanese soldiers raised their clubs to use force. I thought I was outnumbered and had to abandon the rickshaw and flee. I met five Chinese police officers on the road and was reporting the situation when the Japanese soldiers chased after me and struck my head with clubs. I fainted on the spot and blood flowed like a river. Later, a Western police officer took me to the hospital for treatment. Although the wound has healed, my mind is still in a mess and I cannot pull a rickshaw. My whole family is crying for food." After discussion, it was decided to organize the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers' United Anti-Japanese Association. Zhu ChengLin, Bian JiRu, Qin Bizhong, Xu Hongjiang, Han RuXiu, Na YueQing, Liu LianBi, and others were elected to be responsible for submitting a petition to the Municipal Government's Negotiation Office, demanding compensation, consolation, punishment of the perpetrators, apology, and donation to the victims, etc., to be implemented immediately.</p>

<p>The Preparation of the Northwest Aviation Route</p>
<p>Trial Flight on the 10th of Next Month, Formal Flights in the Spring</p>
<p>In the Future, the Europe-Asia Line Will Also Reach This Route Directly</p>
<p>Li Jingcong, Director of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, went to Beiping to prepare for the Northwest Route and has now completed preparations. He returned to Shanghai the night before last. A reporter from the Newsound Society visited Mr. Li at the company yesterday and asked about everything concerning the Northwest Route. Mr. Li spoke in detail, saying that the trial flight has been scheduled for the 10th of next month and that formal flights may be possible around March of next year. At that time, the Europe-Asia Line (i.e., Shanghai to Berlin, Germany) can also be reached directly via the Northwest Route, which is more convenient than detouring through Manchuria. The following is a record of his conversation:</p>
<p>Preparation Process: Mr. Li talked about the preparation process in three points: (1) Regarding the investigation of climate, because the weather in the Northwest is very cold, cold-proof equipment has been prepared for the aircraft parts. The first and second months of the lunar calendar are very cold and difficult to fly. There are no major problems during the rest of the period; (2) Regarding the transportation of gasoline, gasoline is the most important item for flight. It has now been decided that gasoline will be transported from Beiping to various stations. The oil for the Dihua station will be purchased from Russia because the area is close to Russia; (3) Regarding the equipment on the aircraft, such as cold-proof equipment and in-flight drinks and fuel, very good solutions have been obtained.</p>
<p>Surveying Air Stations: Regarding the establishment of air stations, they have now been surveyed. There are a total of five stations from Beiping to Dihua, namely Beiping, Bailin Temple (Hebei), Ruoshui River (Suiyuan), Hami (Ningxia), Dihua (Xinjiang). Xinjiang, passing through the borders of four provinces, a distance of over 1,700 kilometers, equivalent to over 3,000 Chinese miles. Rumors that it must pass through the provinces of Rehe, etc., are inaccurate. These five stations are the shortest route from Ping to Di.</p>
<p>Definite Date for Trial Flight: The trial flight date has now been set for the 10th of next month after the preparations have been completed. This time, he and Mr. Schmidt prepared in Beijing for more than two weeks. It is difficult for them to come to Shanghai and they must go to Ping again at the end of this month or the beginning of next month to preside over the trial flight because further delays will mean that the severe winter will arrive, making it even more difficult to determine the official flight date. However, it must be around February or March of the lunar calendar next year.</p>
<p>Aircraft Issue: As for the aircraft that will fly the Northwest Route, because the company has many aircraft, it does not plan to purchase any more from foreign countries. The aircraft for this trial flight will be the latest type of Junkers W 33.</p>
<p>Europe-Asia Shortcut: The Eurasia Line planned by the company runs from Shanghai to Berlin, Germany, passing through Jingping, Linxi, Manchuria, and the Russian cities of Irkutsk, Moscow, etc., before reaching Berlin. Previously, flights were suspended because an aircraft mistakenly entered Outer Mongolia and was detained, and has not yet been returned, causing great losses. Now, because Jubei has been forcibly occupied by the Japanese, there is no hope of resuming flights. If the Northwest Route is opened, the Shanghai-Berlin line can take a shortcut through the Northwest without passing through Linxi, Manchuria, etc., and can go directly from Shanghai to Ping to Di, cross the Russian border and reach Berlin, which is much faster than before. The journey from Beiping to Dihua takes more than two months. With the establishment of the Northwest Line, it will only take 12 hours for the aircraft to arrive.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Substitute Materials for Japanese Cotton Textile Raw Materials <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>English Yarn Already Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>First Batch of Over 340 Pieces</p>
<p>Original Price of 484 Taels of Silver Per Piece</p>
<p>Since the silk mercerized cotton textile industry in this city unanimously refused to purchase Japanese yarn, the domestic yarn market has become active again. However, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, there is a sudden fear of a shortage of cotton textile raw materials. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs and the Municipal Party Department have convened various related groups to discuss the method of ordering English yarn as a substitute for Japanese yarn, but there has been no good result so far. However, the cotton textile factories with greater capital, after receiving the instruction from the Bureau of Social Affairs to replace Japanese yarn with English yarn, immediately telegraphed directly to Manchester, England, to order large quantities of English yarn for supply. The first batch of orders totaled over 340 pieces. Some of them have already been shipped to Shanghai yesterday and were imported by Best &amp; Co. and Jardine Matheson, two foreign firms in this city, as agents. The English yarn is Green Head, Sudan trademark, with specifications of 40s, 80s, and 32s. The original price is 484 taels of silver per piece. Because its quality is comparable to that of Japanese goods, it is very suitable for use in cotton textiles.</p>

No illegal interference or disposition should be carried out, resulting in conflict with the methods for disposing of Japanese goods. Decision: Respond by letter.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Railway Ministry's Measures to Relieve the Coal Shortage <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Will Organize a National Coal Transport Committee</p>
<p>Since the coal shortage has been felt in this city and the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Ministry of Industry, at the request of various coal merchants, held a meeting a few days ago to discuss relief measures. In addition to representatives from various coal merchants, the Railway Ministry also sent Guan Genglin, Director of the Business Department, to participate in the discussions. Now that the meeting has concluded, Director Guan came to Shanghai yesterday on official business. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed him. The main points of the conversation are recorded below: (Q) What were the results of Director Guan's attendance at the Ministry of Industry's meeting to relieve the coal shortage? (A) At this time, I was ordered by the Ministry to attend the Ministry of Industry's meeting to relieve the coal shortage and reported in detail on the Ministry's plans for transporting national coal. Representatives from all parties expressed satisfaction. (Q) I heard that the monthly coal consumption in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River is huge. How will it be supplied? (A) The annual coal consumption in the Yangtze River area is about four million tons. In addition to supplying a portion of the coal produced in places such as Kai Luan and Qingdao, the meeting hoped that the Ministry would transport 1.2 million tons annually on the Tianjin-Pukou and Beijing-Hankou Railways, averaging 100,000 tons per month, to make up for the shortage. Currently, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has 13 special coal trains, which can transport an average of 4,500 tons per month. In addition, with the allocation from the Beining and Longhai Railways, there will be 20 trains, which can transport 90,000 tons per month. The Beijing-Hankou Railway transports coal from Liuhegou, which can reach 20,000 tons per month, making a total of 110,000 tons per month. (Q) I heard that your Ministry is considering organizing a special supervisory body to urge coal transport. Is that true? (A) Yes, because coal is a bulky cargo and the freight rate is low, sometimes not even covering the cost. From a railway business perspective, it is not as profitable as transporting other goods. However, in order to actively alleviate the coal shortage, the Ministry will organize a National Coal Transport Committee, formulate measures to allocate vehicles from various railways, and directly command them to alleviate the coal shortage, so as to ensure a steady supply. (Q) Does your Ministry rely solely on rail transport for transporting coal, or do you also handle combined water and land transport? (A) The shortage of domestic ships is even more severe than the shortage of vehicles. In the Pukou area, there are currently over 30,000 tons of coal that have been transported there, but they cannot be shipped due to a lack of ships. Tanggu, Qingdao, and other places are also experiencing this problem. The Ministry has consulted with the Ministry of Communications to quickly find a way to allocate ships to facilitate combined water and land transport. According to the Ministry of Communications' reply, it has telegraphed the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau to quickly consult with Shanghai shipping companies to charter ships for transport. The Ministry has also instructed the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau to actively renovate the Pukou docks to prepare for the berthing of large ships.</p>

<p>Another Corpse Dug Up Yesterday</p>
<p>Buried One Zhang Deep Underground</p>
<p>The Corpse Dug Up the Day Before Yesterday Was Female</p>
<p>Digging Must Continue Today</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of the Communist Party's killing and burial to eliminate traces in this city, the French Concession Police and the Public Concession Police have successively dug up eleven male and female corpses in Aitang Village on Yaozhu Jiao Road and No. 6 Xiude Lane on Wuding Road. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. On the 26th of this month, the police continued to dig up a corpse in House A, No. 91 Chenjia Lane, Xin Zha Road. It was said that the name was Zhu Wanbai, who was killed by the Communist Party and buried in the house. The details were seen in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, Prosecutor of the First Special District Local Court, accompanied by Clerk Liu Chun and Forensic Doctor Wei Ligong, went to No. 91 Chenjia Lane to investigate. According to the inspection, the corpse dug up was a female corpse. The name has not yet been found. It was not Zhu Wanbai's corpse. At that time, it was learned that there were four more corpses buried in the house, and they needed to be excavated continuously. Therefore, after Mr. Guo inspected it once, he ordered that after all the corpses were dug up, they should be sent to the Feilun Road Corpse Inspection Office for re-examination.</p>
<p>Also, starting at eight o'clock yesterday morning, the personnel of the Department of Justice and others, together with the Public Concession Police, continued to work at the original excavation site. They were busy for half a day, but at first there was nothing to gain. It was not until around three o'clock in the afternoon that a male corpse was dug up below the third excavation site the day before yesterday. The burial place was as deep as one zhang or more, so the excavation was very difficult. The direction of its location was the northwest corner of the courtyard. The corpse was tied with ropes all over the body, similar to the one obtained the day before yesterday. However, it was buried flat in the soil, and rope strangulation was also seen on the neck. According to personnel at the scene, it was speculated that this corpse may be Huang Di Hong. As for the one dug up the day before yesterday, as mentioned above, it was a female corpse, or it may be Zou Zhishu. Because all the corpses were extremely decayed, it was difficult to identify them at once. It is said that the female corpse dug up the day before yesterday had very long hair on her head, and she was also quite young. She was wearing shorts and slippers, seemingly in summer attire. Corpses have been searched for and dug up for days. As of yesterday, a total of thirteen bodies have been found in the British and French concessions. Digging must continue at the original location today. According to eyewitnesses, the necks of all the corpses that have been found have rope strangulation marks, and what is strange is that the knots on the ropes are all the same.</p>

<p>Zhao Shan, a native of Haimen, 23 years old, led a group with hidden daggers to Zhao Genchang's house in Baijiazhai, Pingliang Road, to rob at 11:30 p.m. on May 31 this year, and shot and killed one person named Yin Yuanyuan, and also shot and wounded Zhao's wife, Zhang, in the right breast. After the case occurred, the Huishi Police Station arrested him and handed him over to the First Special Court, which sentenced Liang to seven years in prison. The police station refused to accept and appealed. After questioning by the High Court, the sentence was changed to death. It was submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval and scheduled for execution. Yesterday afternoon, Cheng Shangfeng, the execution judge of the First Court, took his seat in the Criminal Court No. 3 and brought the appellant to the case. After questioning by the High Court, the sentence was changed to death. It was submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval and scheduled for execution. Yesterday afternoon, Cheng Shangfeng, the execution judge of the First Court, took his seat in the Criminal Court No. 3, ordered the prisoner to be brought to the case, and asked if he had any last words. According to Zhao's confession, he requested a letter to be sent to his sister Shen Zhao at No. 15 Huade Road, Gao郎 Bridge, asking her to comfort his mother and telling her not to worry. There was nothing else to say. Judge Cheng then ordered him to be escorted to the local court for execution. The police escorted the prisoner onto a car and drove to the Caohejing execution ground. Zhao Zikui, a prosecutor from the Shanghai Local Court, was appointed as the supervising official. He immediately ordered Police Chief Xu Jinqing, Police Officer Chen Xihui, and supervising execution police Xue Bingzhang, Wang Jianqing, Yin Daoxu, and Zhang Chunsen to go to the execution ground. The judge then accompanied Warden Dong and Clerk Zhang to their official positions and ordered Zhao Shan to be brought to the case. He confessed that he was 23 years old, a native of Haimen, lived on Huade Road in Shanghai, and worked as a handyman. He requested that a letter be written on his behalf to his father Zhao Jintang at Dasheng No. 3 Factory, Qinglong Port, Waisha, asking him to collect the body. He also told his father to educate his younger brother well and strive for progress. Because he lacked education and befriended bandits, he would not have a good death, and so on. The judge then ordered the execution. Police Chief Xu directed the police to take him away and execute him by shooting. After the forensic examiner verified, he ordered the court to collect the body and issue a sealed coffin for collection.</p>

<p>Re-trial of Liang Chengyu</p>
<p>Believes There Are Still Doubts</p>
<p>Liang Chengyu, a Chinese detective of the Second Division of the General Inspection Office of the General Patrol House, was previously accused by the kidnapped bandits Fang Liansheng and others of being the mastermind behind the kidnapping of Li Huiqing and others. After the police sued the First Special District Court for trial and sentenced Liang to death, the entire case file was submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for review. It has been several months since then. Now the Special Court suddenly received instructions from the Provincial Government, believing that there are still doubts in this case, and ordered a retrial. The Special Court obeyed the order and will schedule a retrial to re-examine the doubts indicated by the Provincial Government.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Huang Chu Jiu <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Real Estate Will Be Auctioned</p>
<p>Court Urges Accountant to Expedite</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Daily Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department went bankrupt, the former French Concession Public Court repeatedly summoned and ordered Huang Chujiu's property to be advertised for auction. The details have been reported previously. The case has been pending until now and has not yet been concluded. Yesterday, Wang Weizhen, the judge of the Second Special Court, opened an execution hearing. The judge first announced to the lawyers representing the creditors that the court was opening today in accordance with the court order of the former French Concession Public Court on July 29 specifically to resolve the auction of Huang Chujiu's real estate, which had no direct impact on the creditors' rights. He then asked Tan Yigong, the lawyer representing Huang Chujiu's family, whether Huang's property had been fully reported. The lawyer then stated that there was still a property in Hangzhou, and a creditor had filed a lawsuit with priority rights in the Hangzhou government office. After the proceeds from the sale were used to compensate, the remaining funds would be transferred to Shanghai and included in the creditors' rights. He also asked whether the Wannian Cemetery was Huang's property. Tan replied that it was a public property, but Huang Chujiu was elected as the manager. This issue must be resolved after the board of directors meeting. Other houses such as the Samsung Stage and the Tiannan Hotel are all built on leased land and should now be actively resolved. However, Huang Chujiu's personal debts amounted to more than two million yuan and should be resolved quickly. Peng Qi, a lawyer, then stood up and claimed that his lawyer had an urgent matter to report. Huang Chujiu previously rented a house on Zhejiang Road from a certain surname for 72,000 taels per year, plus a land tax of about 78,000 taels. The contract stated that this amount would be paid in two installments each year. If one installment was not paid, the owner could unconditionally take it back. Huang Chujiu then mortgaged this rental property to the Tonghui Company for a total of 210,000 taels. The house lost more than 4,000 taels per month. Since Huang's death, Tonghui Company has paid the land rent and other expenses on its behalf, amounting to more than 80,000 taels. This time, the rent payment period has arrived again. Tonghui Company has entrusted someone to repeatedly beg the owner to temporarily suspend the payment. Therefore, it is necessary to urgently request a quick resolution. If it is delayed any longer, once it is unconditionally taken back by the owner, both parties will suffer huge losses and a great danger will definitely occur. Yan Luqing and Xu Yannian, the representatives of the creditors, and their lawyers also stated that this issue must be carefully reviewed by the creditors before being included in the auction. Judge Wang ordered that the case had been pending for a long time and that the accountants Pan and Wu should expedite the auction of Huang's property at the highest price. At this point, it was past noon, and the court adjourned.</p>

<p>Renewal of Permits for Water Supply Equipment Self-Installed by Property Owners</p>
<p>From the Beginning of Next Month to the End of the Month</p>
<p>Failure to Renew the Permit on Time Will Be Subject to Punishment</p>
<p>The City Public Works Bureau has registered 440 places in the city where owners have self-installed water supply equipment. For the convenience of inspection and rectification, the bureau has issued a permit to each place for water use. The permit was originally scheduled to be renewed every year. However, since the owners received the permits at different times, it would be difficult to remember the dates and renew them on time. Therefore, with the approval of the municipal government, it was designated that the period from December 1st to 31st every year would be the permit renewal period for self-installed water supply equipment. Those who received the permit for less than six months can renew it for free. Those who have received the permit for more than six months but less than one year will be charged half the fee of half a yuan. It is now known that the bureau has scheduled to handle the renewal of permits for this term starting on December 1st. However, if the owners have not renewed their permits by the end of December, they will be charged an additional 20% of the permit renewal fee for each day of delay as a penalty for overdue renewal.</p>

Afterwards, Ermei told her sister's husband, and he went to Jin to reason, but Jin was unreasonable and very fierce. So he reported it to the police, who detained him in the Fuzhou Road police station for questioning. Liu Ermei was sent to the hospital for injury examination. It is said that Liu used to work at the Dalong Biji Factory on Yichang Road and is now unemployed. Xi Zhaodi, 21 years old, has an affair with Jin and works at the Dafeng Yarn Factory in Xiaoshadu.

<p>A guest came to the Yuanyuan Hotel at No. 9 Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, the night before last, claiming to be from Zhejiang, named Chen Peiyu, 20 years old, and engaged in the foreign goods business. The waiter led him to the room upstairs. After paying the room fee, he closed the door and slept. It was not until the next afternoon that he got up. The waiters called him outside the door, but he did not respond. Doubts arose. They then tried to pry open the door and went inside to investigate. They saw Chen was dying and lying stiffly on the bed. There was also an empty cigarette box on the table with only a small amount of raw tobacco left. Knowing that he had taken poison, they hurriedly reported it to the police, who ordered the arrest and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment in vain. He died after a while. A business card was found in his pocket, which read Mi Tinghui, style name Wenjie. Whether it is his real name is difficult to determine. The deceased was wearing a gray Walter woolen gown and a short velvet-lined shirt. The body was transferred from the hospital to the corpse inspection office to await the court's inspection.</p>

<p>Shi Jiulin, a native of Yuyao, 30 years old, who lived in the kitchen shed at No. 14 Xingyi Lane, Lagenna Road (Huanghe Road), French Concession, was previously a tailor of iron carts. After losing his job, he became a hawker, selling pork during the day and shouting and selling olives in a bag at night. In the early summer of this year, he married a woman named Lou (21 years old) from Ningbo as his wife. The couple depended on each other for a living. Recently, due to a lack of capital and financial difficulties, he had a suicidal thought. The day before yesterday afternoon, when his wife went out, he locked the door of the house by himself, hung himself with a rope, and committed suicide. At about 5 p.m., his wife returned home, knocked on the door but did not respond. She called the second landlord, Shi Zhuqing, to pry open the door and entered the house before discovering it. It was too late to rescue him. He had already died. She immediately reported it to the police, who carried the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall Corpse Inspection Office.

While chasing a pheasant, his nephew accidentally lost his footing and drowned in the river. Chen, seeing this, believed that he was familiar with water, so he jumped into the river to rescue him. However, it happened to be high tide at that time, and the current was turbulent. He was unable to do so and drowned with his nephew. After the incident, his family sent people to salvage the bodies, but there was no trace. It was not until about 8 a.m. yesterday that the bodies of Chen and his nephew floated up. The two were tightly embracing each other, and the scene was extremely tragic. Zhao Enju, the magistrate of Baoshan County, sent people to inspect after hearing the news.</p>

Resolution: A. According to the report of Committee Members Tong and Chen, Committee Member Xia did not make any mistakes in the appointment and procedures for liquidating the Pacific. B. Jiang Jisheng suddenly declared that he would terminate the appointment and then denied that he would terminate the appointment, which was like a child's play. Moreover, publishing articles in the newspaper to attack Committee Member Xia damaged Committee Member Xia's reputation, which was inappropriate. A letter should be sent to Jiang Jisheng asking him to apologize to Committee Member Xia. Second, a letter should be sent to Committee Member Xia stating that the association believes that there are no errors in the handling procedures for this case. If Jiang Jisheng terminates the appointment according to formal procedures, all books and records should be returned to the association. Committee Member Xia is responsible for dealing with Jiang Jisheng's destruction of Committee Member Xia's reputation.

<h3 id="e164">Recent News of the Shangtuan Chinese Team <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese team of the International Shangtuan has recently been very serious about various military training. At this time of crisis, the people of the whole country are all tragic and heroic, and their blood is boiling. The entire Chinese team in the field of military preparedness, in addition to righteous indignation, has all tended to enrich and actively prepare for breeding and training and to prepare for military preparedness. The following is the recent itinerary:</p>
<p>Expansion of Machine Guns The machine gun is the team's specialized subject. In the past, there were only four machine guns, and only two were used. Therefore, only a few dozen people in the left and right teams were proficient in this subject. Now, the officers of the team believe that the machine gun is an important subject in military affairs and should be popularized to expand training. Therefore, it has been expanded to eight machine guns. All team members, regardless of new or old, can join, so that each can practice. Therefore, recently, the teachers of the subject have been using the morning and evening space to open machine gun lectures in the Shangtuan training hall every day, teaching in separate classes.</p>
<p>The Whole Team is Busy Camping Camping is an important part of the Shangtuan's duties. Each team must hold it once a year. The Chinese team entered the camp yesterday, Friday, and will disband next Monday. The location is still in the barracks of the shooting range for three whole days and nights of concentrated training. It is said that this year's camping curriculum is heavier than in previous years. In addition to the team exercises, practicing the formation of the platoon when advancing, and using signs instead of passwords in the field, there are actual exercises such as charge, slash, and street fighting, as well as lectures on map forms, practicing various fast and slow gun postures, and how to use high and low piers as cover. The curriculum is specified by time, and each member is allocated, working day and night, with no rest for a moment. The camping task is also said to be busy.</p>
<p>The Preparatory Members Start Training The preparatory members recruited by the team this year are expected to be more than 400 people due to the situation, which is more than twice the quota. Among them, half of them were not admitted due to age, guarantee inconsistencies, and poor physical condition. About 200 people who passed the physical examination and examination will be trained on December 1st to impart preliminary military knowledge.</p>

<p>Ordered Aircraft Arrive in Shanghai from England</p>
<p>Ready for Assembly, to Fly to Beijing</p>
<p>Huang Bingheng, Director of the Aviation Bureau, previously, due to aviation school flight class students repeatedly requesting aircraft for practical flight training, despite Huang's best efforts to allocate three aircraft from various aviation teams, the number was insufficient due to the large number of students. Therefore, twelve S.E. 5 aircraft were ordered from the British de Havilland aircraft factory for the aviation school flight class to use for practical experimentation. It is now known that these aircraft have been shipped from England and arrived in Shanghai, temporarily stored at the Hongqiao Aircraft Factory. The factory director, Shen Dexie, is supervising the factory staff in assembling the components. It is reported that seven aircraft have been fully assembled, and the remaining five will be completed within a few days. It is expected that they will fly to Beijing in succession in about three days to provide practical training for the flight class students.</p>

<p>The Citizens' Federation telegram to Ma Zhanshan reads: "Salute to Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang Province.

<h3 id="e169">The Appeal of the Tenants of Yixin Lane <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The tenants of Yixin Lane on Nanjing Road, due to unreasonable oppression and forced relocation by landlords Cheng Linsheng and Cheng Yize, once sent representatives to petition the local party and government authorities, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, the tenants submitted another petition to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and relevant departments, requesting assistance. The original text stated: "We, the citizens, lease houses in and around Yixin Lane on Nanjing Road in the Shanghai Special District for business and residence, only for ten years. Suddenly, we were unreasonably forced to relocate by landlords Cheng Linsheng and Cheng Yize, great landlords, and were sued in court. Although the rights and wrongs should be quietly awaiting the court's decision, we dare not disturb your hearing. However, there are things we cannot refrain from saying and dare to present to your esteemed presence. According to the custom of renting houses in Shanghai, if the landlord wants the tenant to move out, one of the following facts must be present: (1) The house is damaged to the extent that it is uninhabitable and must be rebuilt; (2) The tenant has defaulted on rent for more than three months without reason. Now, the houses in this lane have only been built for ten years and are as good as new, so there is no need to rebuild them. The residents pay rent monthly and have never been in arrears, so there is no reason to force them to move out. Although Article 450, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code stipulates that for contracts without a fixed term, each party may terminate the contract at any time, it clearly states that if there is a custom that is beneficial to the lessee, that custom should be followed. Now that Shanghai has a custom that is beneficial to the lessee, the lessee of the house should be protected by law. Moreover, Article 148 of the Civil Code stipulates that the exercise of rights must not be primarily for the purpose of harming others. Now, we, the citizens, lease the houses in this lane and have invested huge amounts of small rents and renovations, and some have even built three-story houses with the landlord's consent. Some were forced to relocate just one month after moving in. This kind of loss is truly incalculable. The landlord only considers the exercise of his own private interests and disregards the harm to others.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Sun Yat-sen's principle of people's livelihood in his posthumous works discusses the land issue in detail. The key point is that the increase in land value is due to the labor of the public, and the landlord enjoys the benefits without working, which is equivalent to gaining without labor. Therefore, he advocates equalizing land rights. If the behavior of the landlord Cheng Linsheng, the great landlord, only considers his own interests and disregards the labor of the public, it is clearly a violation of Sun Yat-sen's teachings and goes against the purpose of building the country for the benefit of the people. The impact is immeasurable. Therefore, for the sake of maintaining public interests, respecting the law, and strictly following Sun Yat-sen's teachings, we dare not avoid the axe and risk our lives to state our case. We implore you to have mercy on the people's livelihood and hardship and quickly provide relief so that we citizens will not suffer from not having a place to live and do business, and the merchants and residents of the entire city will not be affected by Cheng Linsheng's actions. We citizens would be fortunate, and the citizens of Shanghai would be fortunate. Sincerely bowed by the residents of Yixin Lane on Nanjing Road, Shanghai Special District."</p>

<p>Declaration of all unemployed workers of Dahua Industrial Factory: "Since violent Japan has been rampant and occupied the Eastern Provinces, hearing the news makes our blood boil and tears flow. We colleagues' patriotic enthusiasm dares not lag behind. Therefore, we have specially organized an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, hoping to pledge to save the country under the guidance of the Central Government and make unremitting efforts. However, since the organization is just beginning, everything needs economy. We have repeatedly laid bare the pros and cons to the factory, earnestly requesting assistance and generously allocating subsidies. The factory also agreed to provide strong support because it involved patriotic movement and was a matter of righteousness. We colleagues secretly celebrated that the funds were available and the anti-Japanese work could move forward unimpeded. After a few days, we colleagues, seeing that the funds for anti-Japanese activities were in urgent need, went to the factory to collect them. Unexpectedly, the factory owner Shao Daren was cunning by nature and changed his original intention, suddenly going back on his word, pointing out that organizing anti-Japanese national salvation was a preposterous move, and recklessly ignoring everything, stopping the factory for no reason. His actions of acting as an accomplice for the enemy and helping tyranny are openly sabotaging the anti-Japanese movement and are already outrageous. Moreover, suddenly announcing the closure of the factory disregards the livelihoods of more than 240 workers and is an extremely sinister trick that no capitalist has ever used. Later, he even went further, instigating Cheng Yusheng, the director of the materials department, to beat and injure more than a dozen workers to sell his tactics of armed oppression. We colleagues have repeatedly appealed to the party and government organs for fair assistance, and they have all ordered the resumption of work, but the factory has repeatedly delayed and insisted on not allowing it, and its ulterior motives are obvious. Since the factory stopped work, it has been a month. We colleagues' livelihoods have been exhausted, and we are all in a state of turmoil and displacement. If the factory continues to insist and unreasonably refuses, then the workers have no way to appeal and no way to implement. We have no choice but to gamble with the heads of all the workers. If the factory takes the dismissal of representatives as a condition for starting work, it will be resolutely opposed by all the workers. We hope that all sectors will uphold justice, uphold public reason, and provide strong assistance. This is our declaration. We hope you will take note.

<p>At the Zhao Azhao's house, who is a carpenter in Lingjia Wooden Bridge in the north of Yangjing Town in Pudong, a fire suddenly broke out in the kitchen at 0:30 this morning and immediately broke through the roof. Zhao's daughter-in-law, Pan, woke up from her sleep and saw that the door had been burned down. She hurriedly escaped through the back window. All the boxes and items were burned to ashes before they could be salvaged. When the fire was raging, Inspector Sui Xiangchen of Taikoo Dock led the police to the scene to help extinguish it. It is estimated that five houses and half a hall were burned, with losses of about seven or eight hundred gold. Afterwards, the police from the second branch of the third district ordered the police to bring Zhao's daughter-in-law, Pan, to the case for a brief questioning and sent her to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Unexpectedly, Pan fell to the ground in panic and became unconscious outside the gate of the town. The escorting police woke her up and returned to the office to report. Director Yao instructed her to be temporarily released on bail pending investigation of the cause of the fire.</p>

<p>(Speculating on Future Unified Response)</p>
<p>Japan's aggressive encroachment has roused national indignation. Your esteemed newspaper provides readers with an opportunity to express their anti-Japanese sentiments. As a soldier, I will present my limited views from a military standpoint for your guidance and request publication in your esteemed newspaper for national consideration. The fall of the Eastern Provinces and the League of Nations' inaction have led the people to advocate war with Japan. Given the current situation, our nation cannot survive without war, and Japan cannot fulfill its long-held ambitions without war. China and Japan are irreconcilable. It is like an arrow on the string, that must be released. Once war begins, given China's vast territory and large population, it would take Japan no less than ten years of arduous fighting and enormous military expenditures to conquer all of China. Even if Japan conquered all of China, our people would rise up in rebellion everywhere, and the Japanese army would be exhausted from constant fighting. Moreover, if Japan were to subjugate China, it would certainly arouse the great忌 (jealousy/disapproval) of the great powers. The Japanese must consider this carefully. Therefore, they will certainly not adopt the Yuan and Qing dynasties' method of conquering every city and town. In my opinion, at the beginning of the war, Japan will certainly use all of its naval, land, and air forces to occupy Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Jinan, Haizhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, and other important cities, blockade our ports, cut off our economy, and destroy our arsenals, so that we will have no way to replenish the arms and ammunition that are essential for combat. Then, they will entice and coerce second Xi Qia-types to organize a Chinese government under Japanese protection, provide them with arms and ammunition, and incite them to attack the national army in the interior, while they watch from across the river with indifference. Sixty years later, the so-called protected Chinese government will follow Korea into oblivion. Some might say that my worries are unfounded because Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, and other places have a large number of foreign residents, and there are trade treaty relationships. Even if the Japanese are arrogant, they would not dare to risk incurring the wrath of the great powers by occupying them with military force. Moreover, our country is now united, and there will be no one willing to be a puppet like Xi Qia. I say that is not so. Let me cite examples to prove it. Did Shenyang not have foreign residents? Did the Japanese army not cross the Chinese Eastern Railway and invade Russia's sphere of influence when they occupied Qiqihar? Did the Japanese army's shelling of the Chinese areas in Tianjin not violate the trade treaties? We have not heard of the great powers preventing the Japanese from occupying Shenyang because of the foreign residents there. We have not heard of Soviet Russia expelling the Japanese army for invading its sphere of influence. We have not heard of the foreign troops stationed in Tianjin interfering with the Japanese army's shelling of the Chinese areas. Learning from the past, since the Japanese have been plotting to seize us, they will certainly use diplomatic means of maneuvering, enticing with sweet words and promises of sharing benefits, and making assurances that they will not invade the foreign concessions or harm the interests of the great powers, so that the great powers will turn a deaf ear and remain silent. Moreover, they can also argue to the great powers that "Japan has not invaded China. It is just that the current Chinese government is in constant internal strife, and the people are suffering. Japan, out of concern for its neighbors, has no choice but to help the enlightened people of China to organize a strong government to unify China." The great powers will probably not step forward to uphold justice and make things difficult for Japan if they do not suffer great losses themselves. As for saying that there will be no second Xi Qia, I say, I hope there will be none. However, in the past twenty years, the frustrated warlords and politicians, and the current greedy and power-hungry minority who hold military power and do not know what the country is, once they are coerced and enticed by the Japanese, I fear that there will not only be a second Xi Qia, but also a third, fourth, and countless Xi Qias. Now, summarizing the above discussion, if my words prove to be true, then our country must adopt a strategy of protracted war and be prepared for great sacrifices of people and resources in order to defeat the enemy. The following points are of utmost urgency: (1) We should actively prepare for war. Based on the above discussion, a war between China and Japan is inevitable, and the war will not be far off. Looking at Japan, they are gathering reservists, concentrating naval, land, and air forces, and organizing people's volunteer corps. Now, they are even using the excuse of insufficient government funds to issue bonds of 100 million to cover war expenses. They are poised for action and eager to try. Looking back at our country, according to newspaper reports, except for Guangzhou, where Chen Jitang once convened a meeting of generals and decided to concentrate troops and purchase more arms, other places are still singing and dancing, with no preparation. Troops have not been concentrated and deployed, and arms and ammunition have not been purchased or manufactured. What is even more puzzling is that at this time of national crisis, when we should be expanding our military and planning for war expenses, the Finance Committee is instead greatly reducing military spending, so that the existing troops are paid only 60% of their salaries, and no one is even mentioning the expansion of military equipment or the planning of war expenses. The newspapers are filled with impassioned telegrams from various groups, theoretical articles, and calls for war from the people, as if our people are all made of copper heads and iron arms, and can resist the Japanese warships and cannons with their bare hands. I fear that the pure discussion of Jin people will eventually lead to the chaos of the Five Barbarians invading China. At the beginning of the civil wars in the past, both sides recruited soldiers and expanded their armies, and did not hesitate to spend tens of millions of dollars to buy aircraft, artillery, and other weapons from foreign countries. All the arsenals were working day and night to produce ammunition. Now that a foreign war is imminent, these actions are nowhere to be seen, which is really puzzling. In my opinion, all other undertakings should be temporarily suspended, and the human and financial resources of the entire country should be concentrated on preparing for war. On the one hand, the existing naval and land forces should be mobilized to Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Jinan, Haizhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, and other places. We must seek decisive battles at the national borders and not seek battles in the interior until absolutely necessary. On the other hand, we should implement a compulsory conscription system and expand the army as much as possible (the current disaster victims can be selected first for the strong and formed into troops) to serve as the successors to the existing national army. On the other hand, we should raise huge sums of money to buy aircraft, artillery, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, and other weapons and ammunition materials from the great powers. On the other hand, we should order all arsenals to produce ammunition day and night, and all military equipment that can be manufactured. We must make the whole country soldiers, and everyone can fight. Only then can we talk about a protracted war. If our country can continue the war with Japan for more than two years, Japan will inevitably collapse and retreat. As for the volunteer corps organized in various places, in my opinion, they can be used to maintain order in the rear and encourage the people, but their effectiveness will be minimal if they meet the Japanese army on the battlefield. Because the experience, organization, command, economy, and other aspects of the volunteer corps cannot meet the requirements of actual combat. Young students should not be made to make unnecessary sacrifices unless absolutely necessary. Because these people are talents cultivated by the country for decades, and they are the backbone of the country's future development. If they are sent to the battlefield to sacrifice as soon as the war begins, the country will inevitably lack talent in everything after the victory and armistice. (2) Research on the ammunition problem. I believe that General Ma Zhanshan's withdrawal from Qiqihar was not due to exhaustion of food or lack of reinforcements, but to the exhaustion of ammunition. General Ma's telegram announcing the abandonment of Longjiang said, "After a day and night of fierce fighting, ammunition was exhausted. I had to retreat to Keshan to plan a counterattack." Alas, with General Ma's loyal, courageous, and skilled Black Army, defending a long battle line of more than a hundred miles could have been managed with ease. Even if the Japanese army's firearms were superior, the Black Army's spirit of internal unity could have resisted. However, from November 4 to November 19, after sixteen days of intense defensive battles, even if the Black Army had sufficient ammunition reserves, they would have been exhausted. If Zhang Xueliang and the central government could have supplied ammunition by air from the beginning of the war, I fear that the Japanese army would not be able to water their horses in Longjiang at this time. Speaking of this, let me also mention a strange thing, that is, Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Ma Zhanshan at the beginning of the war, instructing him to retreat to Heihe if necessary (see Shanghai News). Later, Ma Zhanshan fought bravely, but ammunition, salaries, and soldiers were not supplied. He was attacked by public opinion across the country. It was not until November 18 that he telegraphed the troops outside the pass, ordering them to be under Ma's command. What Zhang's intentions were is really incomprehensible. Based on the above facts, after the outbreak of war between China and Japan, the ammunition problem in our country is more important than any other problem. The largest arsenals in our country are Shenyang, Hanyang, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Jinling, especially the Shenyang and Hanyang arsenals. The Shenyang arsenal has already been used by Zhang to help the enemy. Now, more than ten Japanese warships are concentrated in Hankou. I fear that their target must be the Hanyang arsenal. The arsenal is to the army as food and drink are to the human body. With the arsenal in place, it can continuously manufacture arms and ammunition to supply the army, so that we can talk about a protracted war. Once the war between China and Japan begins, the Japanese will certainly use all their naval and air forces to destroy the above arsenals. Then, will our country let it happen naturally and let them destroy them? Or will we find another way to protect the arsenals? In my opinion, our country should now purchase sufficient raw materials for ammunition and order the arsenals to process and manufacture them and transport them to the major military areas in the interior in preparation for a protracted war in the interior. If the government is confident of winning at the national border, it can build air defenses for the arsenals to prevent enemy aircraft from bombing them. If there is no such confidence, then the arsenals must be moved to the interior as soon as possible to avoid becoming a continuation of the Shenyang arsenal. (3) The people of the whole country should have the determination to sacrifice. Most of the people in our country are addicted to comfort and live for the moment. There are many A Dou who are happy and forget their homeland, and few Gou Jian who sleep on brushwood and taste gall. The Eastern Provinces have fallen. Look at the people of the Eastern Provinces, they are still living their lives for the moment. We have not heard of anyone fighting the Japanese with their lives. Today, the people in various parts of the country are indignant, but if they are occupied by the Japanese army, they will not be different from the people of the Eastern Provinces today, living their lives for the moment. Because the general mentality is that "I have elderly parents, I have beautiful wives, I have property, I have fields and houses. If the Japanese do not take them all away temporarily, why should I give up my life?" Alas, this is why India is not a country. Therefore, in my opinion, those who shout patriotism when the enemy is not at the border are not truly patriotic. Those who can fight the enemy with their lives when the enemy is at the border are truly patriotic. Our compatriots must today make a determination that "My life is already dead, but my country's life still exists. I will do everything I can to preserve this country's life." Then, we will not worry about the lack of successors when the war between China and Japan begins. Even if the war begins, and our military is at a disadvantage, Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Jinan, Haizhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, or other places are occupied by the enemy, the people of those places can abandon everything and move to the interior. If the enemy uses violence and threats to prevent them from moving, then they should fight the enemy army and traitors with their lives. At that time, no matter how cunning the Japanese invaders are and how treacherous the traitors are, they will have no way to cope. Today, the compatriots of the whole country must put life and death out of their minds, and everyone must have the idea of being certain to die, considering living as a disgrace and dying in battle as an honor. Only then can we talk about saving the country. As for how to make compatriots have this kind of determination, it depends on the efforts of the intellectuals to publicize it. In my opinion, the government must prepare for the above two items as soon as possible, so as to prevent the above-mentioned important places from suffering the sudden and unprepared fall of Shenyang. For the third item, the compatriots may not all have this ambition, so I offer my humble opinion for discussion.</p>

<p>European War Diary · Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>That afternoon, the Versailles Conference continued to study the armistice treaty and decided to add conditions to the Russian front.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of November 2nd, there was another gathering in Versailles to discuss naval conditions and the Russian line provisions.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Supreme Commander of the Austrian Army received the armistice terms proposed by the Allied Powers from General Diez. What was the attitude of the Vienna government? Accept or reject? If accepted, would the disintegration of Austria-Hungary be sufficient to fulfill the conditions? The Allied authorities were quite hesitant about this issue. That afternoon, Mr. Lloyd George could not but abandon a large part of the demand for the surrender of German battleships.</p>
<p>After the Vienna government succumbed, he immediately put forward all the naval conditions again. He demanded that German battleships be disarmed and surrender multiple warships and submarines. The conditions were very harsh and difficult for the German army to accept. The land armistice terms also could not be signed as a result.</p>
<p>I asked the Allied governments to pay attention to the responsibility for continuing the bloodshed. The Allied governments then instructed me to include the naval conditions in the armistice terms, so that if the enemy could not accept the naval conditions, we could revise them.</p>
<p>In fact, the German army accepted everything.</p>
<p>The conditions on the Russian line and the Romanian front were accepted without discussion. Regarding this point, the French Foreign Minister Pichon raised the issue of the restoration of Poland, which was one of the war aims of the Allied forces. However, it was decided that this issue should not be mentioned in the same breath as the armistice issue. Now, it was only decided to demand that the German army in the east retreat to the original state in 1914.</p>
<p>On November 4th, the specific armistice terms were finally approved at the Versailles Conference. The leaders of the Allied governments immediately telegraphed President Wilson and decided that I, together with the British naval commander, would present these terms to the plenipotentiaries of the German government and be responsible for the negotiations.</p>
<p>When these terms were notified to Washington, the special envoy of the British government to the Allied governments reserved the principle of freedom of the seas among President Wilson's Fourteen Points.</p>
<p>I ordered the front-line soldiers to allow the German representatives to pass through the defensive lines to negotiate, while warning the troops to strictly guard against rumors.</p>
<p>At 12:30 AM on the night of November 6th, I received the first radio message from the German Supreme Command, notifying the names of the plenipotentiaries specially dispatched by the Berlin government and requesting that a meeting place be designated and whether a temporary ceasefire could be implemented when the German representatives arrived at the Allied lines.</p>
<p>I immediately replied simply, "If the German plenipotentiaries wish to meet Marshal Foch to request an armistice, they can go directly to a certain French military line. The guards have been ordered to escort them to the meeting place."</p>
<p>On the morning of the 7th, I learned that the German plenipotentiaries would depart from Spa at noon and arrive at the French military lines between 4:00 and 5:00 PM. The French and German armies prepared to cease fire when the German delegation passed through the fire line.</p>
<p>Together with Chief of Staff Weygand and three officers from the headquarters, and accompanied by the British naval representatives, I departed from Saint-Lyé by special train at 5:00 PM in the afternoon to meet the German plenipotentiaries in the Forest of Compiègne near Rethondes station.</p>
<p>Because the road in the German defense area was blocked, the German delegation did not arrive at the French military lines until 9:00 PM. They were twelve hours late to their destination. They did not arrive at the meeting place until 7:00 AM on November 8th.</p>
<p>The first negotiation was held at 9:00 AM in the French railway office car.</p>
<p>After the armistice treaty was signed, I reported the details of the Rethondes Conference between the Allied and German plenipotentiaries to the French President and Prime Minister. (Note: On November 8th, 1918, the negotiations began after the German representatives arrived. The Allied representatives were Marshal Foch, Chief of Staff Weygand, British Naval Commander Wemyss, Hope, and British Navy Captain Mari. The German representatives were Erzberger, Huf von Waldaorf, General Winterfeldt, Navy Captain Vanselow, Colonel Gatcher, and Colonel Heldor. The negotiations lasted for three days. The German side tried their best to reduce Foch's conditions. The German delegation repeatedly consulted with Berlin via radio. At 2:05 AM on the morning of November 11th, 1918, the German delegation notified Foch that they were ready to sign. At 2:15 AM, the final meeting was held. Chief of Staff Weygand read the armistice terms. At 5:05 AM, the terms were finalized. At 5:10 AM, the terms were signed. The German representatives withdrew. Marshal Foch immediately issued a radio message to the entire line, ordering a ceasefire at 11:00 AM.)</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM on the morning of November 11th, the Allied forces ceased fire on the entire line. The great war lasted fifty-three weeks, and the guns were now silent. The world began to see the hope of peace again.</p>
<p>The next day, I issued a victory message to the Allied forces as follows:</p>
<p>Soldiers of the Allied Forces,</p>
<p>You fought hard for months to repel the enemy and then attacked the enemy with indomitable spirit and unwavering determination.</p>
<p>You have won the greatest war in history and saved the most sacred ideals, the freedom of the world.</p>
<p>You deserve to be proud of your achievements.</p>
<p>You have gained immortal glory and eternal praise.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces, Foch (To be continued)</p>

<p>By Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, Translated by Liang Yuchun</p>
<p>The first point is to critique Canterbury's ideology, which cannot be rigidly fixed. He cites ancient doctrines, "…society is like a pipe organ, but it can only play one simple harmony. The legislator's duty is to tune the organ so that it can accurately play that tone. Therefore, if Plato could follow his ideas, his large-scale universal harmony (the great harmony of producers, soldiers, and philosophers), the place where all members of society gather, would monotonously and rigidly play until now. The harmony Plato envisioned is naturally wonderful, but the discordant sounds he suppressed have been increasing in volume day by day, echoing noisily in the vaults of time from his time to the present. I often think that these discordant sounds contain a greater harmony, more dignified than any harmony he imagined. Moreover, that noise is cleverly woven into a cosmic symphony, too profound for us to understand more than a small part. Only the immaculate wisdom of the gods can appreciate it." He says, "The fundamental flaw of all ideal polities is that no matter how perfect that polity is, it can only be applied to the situation at that time... But that situation should only be a temporary and short process in human history, not to continue so immutably... As for simply rigidifying the current polity, treating it as a precious treasure without adding any ideal elements, the abuses are even more self-evident."</p>
<p>He believes that the grand system of the universe, encompassing everything, self-</p>
<p>Follows natural evolution and change, which is an unavoidable law of nature. If a fixed restriction is imposed, it hinders natural evolution. Therefore, the political ideal of liberalism is a laissez-faire policy that disregards everything. In the end, he says, "We are letting the people do as they please... I believe in people... If I can't trust them, what am I supposed to believe in?"</p>
<p>The second point is to explain the principles of free trade. He believes that this is also a natural fact within the universe. He says, "I dare say that among all human activities, the most obvious expression of God's will is this exchange of products... I want to say that the current situation resulting from the implementation of free policy can prove the benefits of free policy... I believe that soon other countries will also awaken, see their own interests clearly, and establish new laws regarding the economy to compete with us. As a result, everyone will benefit. I see that countries around the world are about to put down political hatred, unite, and engage only in peaceful commercial competition. The booming of cannons has stopped, and only the soft creaking of spinning machines is heard... Humanity will no longer meet on the battlefield, but will meet through their chosen representatives, as our greatest poet said, in 'the parliament of man, the federation of the world.'"</p>
<p>His language is very pure and clear, and his reasoning and judgment are harmonious and tight-knit, absolutely making people feel impeccable.</p>
<p>The third speaker is Mendoza, the current leader of the Conservative Party and Lyndemere's major political rival. His argument is extraordinarily cold, sharp, and witty. He opposes Lyndemere's liberalism. He believes that freedom can never be unlimited. To maintain social balance, there must be many intervening forces, and he uses the police as an example.</p>
<p>His opening statement immediately embarrassed Lyndemere. He said, "A person who does not have the privilege of directly hearing God's instructions..." In one sentence, he was able to reflect that what Lyndemere said had become a non-factual joke. The example he gives is:</p>
<p>"Take the police system as an example... With the help of the police, the weak can manage the strong, and the minority can manage the majority. With his help, many people who should be eliminated in the struggle for survival are actually living... The marriage system is tightly tied to his hem, and the private property system runs into his arms and quietly lies down."</p>
<p>"…If freedom is not guaranteed by any authority, then what is the difference between freedom and chaos, if only in terms of freedom itself? If we do not use the presence or absence of a considerable component of interference to distinguish between freedom and chaos, what other distinction do we have? If we acknowledge this distinction of the presence or absence of an interference component, aren't we going to walk down from the mountain peak of unrestrained prophecy to the barren and itchy plains of political compromise?"</p>
<p>Next, he explains the Conservative Party's political views. He says, "What we pay attention to is not all of humanity, but the British people; not an ideal polity, but the British constitution; not some political economy, but the actual state of our commerce. In this great forest of facts, filled with new and old weeds, secular lazy trees, fat bushes, and beautiful climbing vines, we always follow the old paths, stepping slowly and cautiously, striving to prevent those old paths from being blocked, and daring not to open up new paths. Unless we truly understand that the new path will lead to the destination, we will never cut down the good trees to make a new path."</p>
<p>Furthermore, he describes his views on foreign trade and world alliances, which stand in opposition to Lyndemere and have his own unique insights. He says, "He sees in his imagination a period of peace brought about by commerce, where everyone has good intentions towards each other. He believes that through God's mysterious means, greed and competition will help us achieve benevolence and peace. But I cannot boldly fantasize along with him on this point... Or look forward with hope to that Crystal Palace-style era of great happiness... I believe that the future will contain many wars and rumors of wars. Our Britain, because of its wealth and unprecedented success, will especially be the target of envy and resentment from the people of all Europe. They look around, wanting to find a place to transplant the ever-increasing number of people, only to see that the land is already occupied by the British everywhere, and the British flag is always flying. This is Britain's greatest danger, but I grasp from this point the only hope for our country's future. The territory of Britain is not just those three islands... I believe that our colonies will not fall away from us like ripe fruits, and our dependencies will not fall into the hands of other masters. Sooner or later, Britain will awaken and understand the mission of its great empire. The British people across the sea will be of one heart and one mind with me. Therefore, the great alliance that I foresee is not an alliance of humanity, but a great alliance of the British people in the world."</p>
<p>His thoughts are very representative of the imperialist ideology of the average Englishman.</p>
<p>The fourth speaker is Allison, a moderate socialist and a powerful critic of both parties.</p>
<p>He first briefly criticizes the opinions of Lyndemere and Mendoza, and then explains the socialist theory he advocates. He believes that "nature" is a chaotic state without rules, and all culture contains the meaning of restraint. Socialism is of course also restraint. Socialism is revolutionary, and liberalism, if it is not empty talk, should also be revolutionary. Revolution does not contain the act of rebellion. The act of rebellion is only the miscarriage of the revolution. The meaning of socialism is to increase the effectiveness of social organization. Political power should be expanded. The reason why the people do not trust the government now is that the current government is an organ for the benefit of special classes. Socialism is to replace the government of corrupt officials with a clean government of the common people. Social organization should pay attention to the cultivation of new ethics, new habits, and new religions. The only fundamental creed of socialism is that human progress depends entirely on "conquest". Nature, and science are people's only weapon to "conquer" nature.</p>
<p>Finally, he describes his attitude of faith. He says, "We can be said to be cooperating with the force of the universe... Because the evolution of things will naturally reach the point we hope for... Even if we stop rowing, our boat will still move forward. If we are temporarily blocked, the currents that hinder our boat's progress only belong to one or two special places, not the trend of the entire current. Among all politicians, only we have faith, but our faith is based on science, so it is a permanent and unshakable faith."</p>
<p>With his arrival, the direction of the conversation changed from political views to a discussion of socialism.</p>
