<p>時評</p>
<h3>今後數月内之歐局</h3>
<p>今日英德兩方。均宣布英相麥唐納與外長漢德森定下月十七日赴德報聘。漢德森於赴德前先赴日内瓦。與全歐各國外長會晤。作一度商榷。美國務卿史汀生亦。亦將於二十一日赴德洽商。而美財長梅隆氏。則已抵倫敦與英相有所討論。於是柏林與日内瓦兩地。皆將有關於歐局問題之會議。而歐美間之問題。亦將有所决定。故說者謂今後數月中爲歐戰後最爲緊要之時期。非無故也此兩會議爲德人請求减輕賠欵與解决戰債問題而起。此後會議。果有以慰請求者之希望。則可以掃除國際間之危機而歐局以安。若進行多障碍。無相當結果。則此後歐局。恐將轉至緊張。或竟引起一番紛擾。亦未可知。故此後數月。誠爲歐局變化之一大關鍵。德國人民見英美要人蒞德消息。皆露歡欣之色。德報警告其勿作過分之希望。甚爲合理。蓋今日希望過奢者。則將來失望。必將過悲。與國家亦有關係者也。</p>

<h3>德國賠欵問題將有重要發展</h3>
<p>英當局下月赴德報聘前</p>
<p>日内瓦先召集全歐會議</p>
<p>美國務卿準備訪柏林</p>
<p>梅隆游英與戰債無關</p>
<p>德銀行允貸欵政府</p>
<p>恃各種新收入作抵</p>
<p>▲國民社十八日倫敦電　今日此間正式發表、英相麥唐納與外相漢德森、定於七月十七日報聘、同時日内瓦刋行之日内瓦日報聲稱、日前英德當軸會晤結果、漢德森業已邀請全歐各國外長、於七月十三日在日内瓦相會、是漢德森在偕首相赴德之前、將先與全歐外長作一度商榷、又美國務卿史汀生料亦將於英當軸赴德之日、同時抵柏林、而美財長梅隆目下方在歐洲旅途中、諒必與德要人相會、因此逆料下月内關於德國之要求緩付賠欵問題、或將有顯著之行動、而國際戰債與賠欵之全部結搆、在日内瓦與柏林定將提出討論云、</p>
<p>▲國民社十八日柏林電　今日公佈消息稱、英首相麥唐納及外相漢德森答訪德總理及外長起見、已定於七月十七日抵柏林、盤桓數日、即於二十日返英、美國國務卿史汀生到德、約在七月二十一日、故英德談話得有結果、即可與美國務卿繼續協商、又美財長梅隆刻正在倫敦、與英首相有所討論、故預料各方經過開誠交換意見之後、德國賠欵問題之討論、有急流直下之勢、約在八月中旬定可見諸事實云、至於輿論方面對於此種布告、雖諄諄警告、勿作過分之希望、但亦不能掩其歡悅之態度、而人民方面亦皆視以後之數月、爲自歐戰以後最緊要之時期、其望賠欵計劃之修正、不啻大旱之望雲霓、</p>
<p>▲國民社十八日柏林電　比利時財長郝太特日昨在參議院聲言、比政府尚無允准德國賠欵計劃修改之意、比財長此種宣言、雖係在參院中受人質問後之答語、但在此關係全歐大局之際、比財長竟出此貿然之態度、殊可怪異、而德國人民對於此項宣言所受可痛之印象、實至深刻、</p>
<p>▲國民社十八日柏林電　德國各大銀行刻已完成墊資政府之大計劃、以二萬五千萬馬克貸予政府、俾得安渡目前之難關、該項借欵之抵押、即爲緊急命令頒布後在計劃中所應得之各種新收入、據半官報告、德國國庫去歲虧空約二萬零四百萬馬克、今年政費不足之數、約爲一萬二千一百三十萬馬克、此外債欵項下尚短少八千二百七十萬馬克、</p>
<p>▲路透社十八日倫敦電　美國財政部長梅隆刻在倫敦作私人游歷、英倫銀行總裁訪之於旅館、並共午餐、昨今兩日梅隆與英相麥唐納外相漢德森晤談、</p>
<p>▲路透社十九日倫敦電　美國財政梅隆之游英、一般人士疑其非純粹休假性質、自昨日梅氏先後晋謁英首相麥唐納外相漢德森後、衆疑益甚、路透社巴黎訪員電稱、法國現密切注視梅隆之行動、小巴黎人報推論此事、謂梅隆之談話、表明曾與英當局討論歐洲某某數國之時局、及賠欵債務一類問題、梅隆似已不復主張美國當局對於歐洲之財政困難應束手旁觀云云、但唐甯街英相府今晨發表正式文告、否認英政府請梅隆來倫敦、討論修正戰債或其他問題之說、謂外傳一切、全屬子虚、</p>
<h3>奥新内閣難産</h3>
<p>奥發行國庫債券</p>
<p>英銀行墊欵援助</p>
<p>▲國民社十八日維也納電　恩德爾博士日前不願接受組閣之命令、今又表示願意、但提出條件、須授彼完全狄克推多之職權云云、故奥國政局已因此發生特殊之狀態、彼之主張謂國會可解散、暫時代以各黨派所組織之混合委員會、恩氏謂非如是、不能使奥國脫離目前混亂之狀態云、但奥國之憲法與德國之憲法顯然不同、政府無解散國會之權、而國會之解散、須國會自身三分之二議員之通過、故據現在之情形觀察、頗難成爲事實也、預料恩德爾不得不放棄其計劃云、</p>
<p>▲國民社十八日柏林電　恩德爾氏以上所言之計劃、因除恩氏本黨人員之外、無他黨願授以迭克推多之威權者、故現已放棄組閣之計劃、</p>
<p>▲路透社十八日倫敦電　英倫銀行在國際借欵談判未畢以前、暫墊英金四百萬鎊、借與奥國國家銀行、此項消息、極爲維也納人士所歡迎、即倫敦金融界亦贊成英倫銀行之舉動、倫敦外國證券市塲今日德國債劵倐然漲價、亦與英倫銀行墊欵事有關、</p>
<h3>南斐部落械鬭</h3>
<p>起因甚微雙方死傷十七人</p>
<p>▲路透社十八日　般電　南斐克蘭資柯附近之阿木山境、今日有兩部落械鬭、死傷各十七人、雙方情感惡劣、已有多年、今日甲部落村莊中舉行結婚禮、乙部落女子數人往觀之、受甲村之奚落、憤而返家、其族人乃立即集合、携械圍攻甲村、結果死傷多人、現亂事已平、甲村撤回反攻之凖備、願由官塲依法辦理、現官塲已拘捕肇事者二人、</p>
<h3>西班牙新憲法草就</h3>
<p>國會採兩院制政敎實行分治</p>
<p>▲國民社十九日瑪德里電　西班牙憲法起草委員會已草成新憲法、國會採兩院制、但參院立法受有限制、又將若干社會事業立法事件、劃歸地方議會、喀泰蘭地方得在憲法範圍内經濟自治、總統職權仍照法國、成年男子咸有選舉議員權、婦女則否、政敎分治、但准宗敎機關照舊設立、</p>
<h3>法衆院通過海軍建築案</h3>
<p>但附有修正</p>
<p>▲路透社十八日巴黎電　法國衆議院今日辯論一九三一年海軍建築案、歷時頗久、此案列有造一大巡艦二萬三千噸、以抵制德國新式戰艦之經費、衆院雖通過此案、但附有修正、將大巡艦之造費、留待將來再議、聞新巡艦暫不開始建造、俟此問題續經研究後、再行决定、</p>
<h3>太平洋島權讓與英法正開秘密談判</h3>

<h3>波拉主張對俄復交</h3>
<p>爲維持美國商業計</p>
<p>▲國民社十八日坎巴電　參院外交委員會波拉、今日在埃達化州律師公會演說、謂美國當停止對俄之無謂攻擊、不甯唯是、且當與蘇俄輯睦邦交、否則美國將失去與蘇俄之貿易、近因美國對俄肆意攻擊、故美俄商業已低落百分之二十云、波拉氏現擬在埃達化州度夏、繼續運動美國承認蘇俄、并擬以其餘暇注意銀問題、</p>
<h3>莫斯科建設大計劃</h3>
<p>期於三年内完成</p>
<p>▲國民社十八日莫斯科電　關於莫斯科京城之建設中央執行委員會、决定使各管屬機關籌備三年建設計劃、使三年之内完成五十萬人之新住屋、莫斯科蘇維埃並將撥欵八千萬盧布之譜、補充該項費用、此外並將建築機器麵包廠五所、醫院數所、洗衣所幼穉園等、其餘之建築如中央車站及地下軌網、决計按照德國克雷美爾工程師之計劃、從事大規模建造、</p>
<h3>美報評論中國時局</h3>
<p>對伍朝樞辭職深致惋惜</p>
<p>▲美聯社十八日紐約電　此間國民新聞社紐約辦事處、今日調查美報對於中國政治軍事之論調、類皆趨向於和平一途、如紐約紀事論壇報今日社評、論南京與廣州之異趨聲稱、凡欲促事勢之變遷、使無從避免戰爭者、皆不能獲致祝願中國興盛者之同情心、吾人僅能謂有一革命新集團、趁偶然發生之事實、放一宣傳大砲、被所揭櫫之理由、縱極重要、若較諸和平、則其重要更將十倍於彼唐紹儀之指摘、此外如紐約晚報紐約時報對於伍朝樞之辭職嚮粤、均有惋惜之詞、</p>

<h3>皖北災禍之慘狀</h3>
<p>蚌埠通訊、皖北不幸、災患頻仍、年來迭次戰亂、地方元氣已傷、近月匪共蠭起、爲害較前益甚、加之水患雹災、相逼而至、人民生計日蹙、流亡載道、露宿風餐、其凄苦誠有不堪言狀者、兹將各情形、略述如次、</p>
<p>▲匪害　皖北歷年多匪、雖迭經官軍民團勦捕、但此勦彼竄、兵去匪來、迄今未能肅清、匪之燒殺淫掠、亦甚兇殘、宿縣西北蔡里睢溪一帶之股匪、近經第七師龔團痛勦、匪首三毛猴王崑崙被擒後、匪氛稍戢、而壽縣合肥六安交界之三覺寺附近一帶、近被著匪張子彬股盤踞騷擾、迭經合肥駐軍會同壽六兩縣警民團兜勦、因匪飄忽無定、一時未能撲滅、盱眙東鄉馬湖店地方、前被馬玉仁蔣國常殘股竄至刦掠、焚燬附近百餘村、嗣經該縣警團進剿、匪分兩股逃竄、一股避匿旰滁來交界之老嘉山、一股竄回洪澤湖畔老子山、他如泗·五·渦·毫·太·阜·等縣、雖有零星匪徒、尚無大患、惟現在秋紗帳起、匪有遮蔽、進剿更爲不易矣、</p>

<p>▲水患　皖北爲淮河流域、士壤肥沃、出産以小麥黄豆爲大宗、值豐收之年、麥豆多行銷於南北各省、詎料今夏正值麥苗生穗之際、霪雨連綿、旬日不止、淮河之水、陡漲丈餘、懷遠·鳳台·壽縣·霍邱·等縣沿淮麥苗、被水淹壞三分之一、其未被淹没者、因受水浸、亦奄奄待斃、故本年夏季、小麥收成大减、據壽鳳等縣來蚌災民談、當淮河水漲之時、因壽縣拔去北門外附城壕壩、以致兩縣交界處六十里地、盡成澤國、田禾俱被淹没、而霍邱北境、亦一片汪洋、農民損失不貲、各埠壽鳳霍同鄉會、已紛紛代災民呼籲、請賑救濟矣</p>
<p>▲雹災　今年皖北遭遇雹災者、爲宿太兩縣、上月三十一日、宿縣有數區降雹、被災地段、損失甚鉅、情形已紀昨報、太和亦於同日被災、降雹區域、東自李興集、西至豫邊之秋渠、北自慈聖集之金家廟、南至馬家集之晷寨、縱横各三十餘里、所有田禾、被風雹摧殘殆盡、擊死人畜甚多、在棗樹莊王家莊之間、降一巨雹、長丈餘、四五人不能舉其一端、災情可以想見、現在宿太兩縣各組織雹災賑濟委員會、並派員調查災情、以便救濟、（六月十八日）</p>

<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>家委託棉布業代爲辦理之、（二）繳納捐欵之責任、屬於客家、須負責照數繳還、不得短少、此兩點提出後、棉布業方面、因鑒於上次車資問題、雖經調解决定、然客帮方面仍迄未照案履行之覆轍、故當即提出付還代繳捐欵之保障問題、同時客帮方面又仍復固執於大包小包之成見、因此雙方意見不能接近、遂無結果而散、</p>

<h3>詳誌總理廣州蒙難紀念</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>本月十六日。係本黨總理廣州蒙難九週紀念。上海特别市黨部特召集本市各界民衆。在黨部禮堂開紀念大會。次日各報限於篇幅。僅將大概情形披露一二。予曾往參加。見聞較詳。誌之如下。</p>
<p>是日黨部門口。高懸「上海各界紀念總理廣州蒙難第九週年大會」竹布横額。黨國旗分掛左右。禮堂内供碩大無朋之總理西裝半身遺象。四週圍以松柏。滿綴紙花。壁上遍貼「繼續總理的奮鬥精神。」「繼續總理不妥協精神」等標語。宣傳部部長楊清源主席。謂總理爲求中國之自由平等。致力於國民革命事業垂四十年。經過困苦艱難。不勝枚舉。而以民國十一年廣州一役蒙難時日最久。危險亦最大。給我輩深刻印象。痛切敎訓。應永遠視爲最感奮惕勵的紀念。當時粤桂軍權。掌握於陳炯明。表面揚言擁護總理。暗中反對總理政策。時總理排除萬難。躬率大軍。在桂林誓師北伐後。陳逆嗾兇暗殺鄧鏗同志。斷絶北伐軍餉。欲置前線將士於死地。旋因趙恒惕不允假道。移大本營於韶關。回兵廣東。向贛進發。陳逆即密令其爪牙葉舉等圍攻總統府。佔據機關。並懸賞二十萬元謀害總理。事前有人密電總理。請離府暫避。秘書林直勉當晚又入府報告。總理以爲陳縱惡劣。當不至出此逆倫反常叛徒賊子之手段。不久叛軍進逼。林等復勸總理離府。猶願一死殉國。以謝國民。林等見事機迫切。强挽出府而登楚豫軍艦。逆軍迭次襲擊。總理始終雍容鎭定旋因北伐軍討逆不利。乃將靖亂大任付託各地援師。於八月八日離粤赴滬。此五十餘日内。所受艱辛危險。不知有若干次。結果叛軍不能損及總理毫髮。而總理之革命精神。與救國赤誠。益昭如日月。更爲全國所敬仰。今日紀念總理蒙難。應聯想總理創造民國之艱難。今日所得之局面。均係先烈犧牲無量頭顱碧血所换來。非鞏固統一。不足以保和平。現在殘餘軍閥。無聊政客。又麕集廣州。萬惡之共産黨横行江西。均爲民國之障碍。望各界民衆。一致起來擁護訓政的約法。打倒危害黨國的新軍閥。而鞏固和平統一。衆皆鼓掌。旋通過議案兩件。并高呼「紀念總理廣州蒙難。「掃除一切反動派」等口號而散。</p>

<p>心碎。腸斷。原是詩人詞客對於失戀者過火的形容詞。但是講戀愛的人。至少有三種病症。失眠症。不消化病。與莫名其妙的憂鬱病。</p>
<h3>妙說拾雋</h3>
<p>— 才良</p>
<p>潘光旦先生說「優生學」三個字。在我們貴國人的腦海中。恐怕還没有這個印象。可是西洋人對於它。却已由人類而及於各種動物。什麽馬有馬婆。牛有牛姆。關於種子的選擇。都有極深切的研究。你看上海跑馬廳裏的馬。都這樣的雄偉奇壯。就是一個强有力的證據。其他也可想而知。若論我們貧而且弱的民族。當然處處要被人家的欺侮。因爲在他們眼光裏。簡直還不及牛馬。說到這裏。你想可痛不可痛啊。所以照我看來。要想生存在現世界的民族。尤其是生産落後的中國。那更非努力地研究「優生學」不可。等到人種眞改良好。那國也不强而自强了。</p>

<p>費昆年博士。曾任德奥各國立醫院醫師十餘稔。邇以省親返斾。余以食少爲憾。曾赴派克路九號費寓就敎。獲奥大利土方紅茶加餐法。試之功效如神。旋復晤費氏。談泰西土方多則。兹録其要者。供諸閱者。</p>
<p>▲紅茶加餐　吾人每遇胃呆消化不良。或因身弱或以事冗。飯量不佳。補救之道。每日晨起。空腹進濃紅茶一杯。茶置多量白糖。尤甘尤貴。即糖茶比例各半。亦無不可。服旬日後。當能健飯逾常。</p>
<p>▲鹽湯止湯　運動工作後。往往汗流浹背。口渴特甚。飮任何流質物。徒增腹脹之不快感。而無補於解渴。渴在後　。爲觸與温或壓與燥之混合感覺。其原因在唾液停流。體内水及鹽之成分缺乏。倘喝鹽湯一杯。津液自生。</p>
<p>▲啤酒解醉　酷嗜杯中物者。輒致酩酊。翌日猶頭目暈眩。神志不爽。再進酒少許。精神舒適。常態恢復。俗名還魂酒。若進以冷啤酒一杯。其效更著。用鮮擰檬糖茶代酒。亦佳。</p>
<p>▲打噎鼻塞　喉頭偶受特殊刺激。打噎隨之。執鼻。止呼吸。同時飮温熱茶水數口可治。傷風初期。鼻塞難忍。將檸檬汁煑沸。置糖。乘熱盡一杯。鼻得通。身覺違和。膚孔　　。二竪如將臨。喝冷開水一大杯。和以碘酒一滴。可預防。惟碘酒甯少母多。量過一滴則傷身。</p>
<h3>救荒食料之研究（中）</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>第三方云。黑豆七升。芝蔴三升。水淘過即蒸。不可泡久。蒸過晒乾。去殻再蒸。以三蒸三哂爲度。搗爲丸如龍眼大。每服一丸。三日不飢。予按板栗胡桃。所含滋養料。比之糯米芝蔴尤多。而黑豆尤比板栗胡桃爲多。試列如左。</p>
<p>品名　淡素　含水　炭素　蛋白質　脂肪　澱粉　備考</p>
<p>板栗　一七四、　二二、八　二一八、九四　每斤可抵食米四斤十一兩</p>
<p>胡桃　一七○、九四　三五五、一四　一九、一四　每斤可抵食米四斤十二兩</p>
<p>黑豆　二○四、　一○八、　一三八、　每斤可抵食米五升六合</p>
<p>觀於上列。足見第二方之效力。固較第一方爲大。而第三方則尤勝。吾杭每年度歲。必以糯米裏粽。其餡分数種。以黑豆去皮。炒爲泥者。謂之沅沙。即第三方也。其粗製者。則以黑豆混入糯米。謂之烏豇豆粽。或搗豆成泥。並不去皮。謂之豆沙。皆取其易飽耳。或以板栗和入糯米。謂之栗子粽。即第二方也。又以棗泥爲餡者。則第一方也。其以糯米粉爲　者。則用芝蔴胡桃爲餡。則又參用第一二三方。而洗沙湯　。或豆沙饅首。則亦本乎此義。是皆人所常食。又何疑慮之有哉。</p>

<h3>奇異之結婚法</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>昨晤舊友某君。軍人也。相晤之下。爲我述福建汀州女子結婚之風俗。頗趣。亟誌之以實自由談。</p>
<p>汀州女子極開通。貌美而慧。雖在前清。已無纒足之陋習矣。</p>
<p>凡處女在十七歲至十九歲三年間。爲彼等擇偶之期。每遇元宵端午中秋等節。類皆濃妝艶服。四出尋求異性。如合意。可招之家中。告諸父母。其父母則待之如上客。享以蓮子湯團等吉利之食物。希望彼二能由此團圓而連生貴子也。是日。男子即居女家。</p>
<p>若女子認此男子爲可靠。則宣告與之結褵。雖父母亦無權干涉。結婚之日。凡以前曾受女子招徠到家之男子。（可謂情場失意者）。皆應餽贈摺扇一柄。并署名於其左。半開之。排列於禮檯上。而其良人之一柄。則全開之。放於中央。是扇實代表女家之資格。多則爲榮。少則鬱鬱不樂也。</p>
<p>汀州屋宇甚大。多有一竹簾。無事時。婦女皆隱於簾後。以望屋外之風景。如有男子見之。不論已識未識。均可入内與之談話云、</p>
<p>其地有一溪。兩岸滿植桃花。花紅時。溪水輙作紅色。故名曰桃花溪。亦一奇事也。</p>
<p>▲出版界消息　味報内容豐富、宗旨純正、自出版以來、頗得讀者之讚許、兹聞第三期定於今日出版、取材尤多精彩、各報販均爲發售、外埠函索附郵即寄、飽址上海勞合路二三一號云、（王沿津）</p>

<h3>三個時代（一一）</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>（五）第二個仇人</p>
<p>張小三兒所以當兵。雖是爲了想弄個出頭年。其實還是讓他媳婦張二嫂氣的。張二嫂總是說「作官的爺們找不着。拉車的爺們還找不着嗎」。張小三兒一想。咱又不認得字。又没錢。那裏去弄官作。這總算讓媳諒定了。後來一想說書的說到薛仁貴。也是個苦小子出身。我就不能學一學嗎。要作官。除非是去當兵。這樣一想。因之遇到了天橋招兵的演說家一勸。馬上就投軍了。投軍以後。才知道要作官。並不是一件容易事。爲了要挣這口氣。才來投軍。不料投了軍。更不如從前。這都是爲跑掉了那個媳婦弄成的。更恨着伊了。警士是張小三的仇人。讓他楱了一頓。總算出了口氣。第二個仇人。就是他的媳婦？也要找着伊飽打一頓子才好。但是自伊逃跑之後。就不知道伊隱藏到什麽地方去了。如何可以找着伊。光陰是很容易過。一轉眼就是一年。這天張小三隨着大軍出發。他在輜重隊中押了兩大車行李。經過天橋出永定門。大車正走到天橋頭。遇到第二個仇人了。伊現在不是從前那個樣子了。頭髮梳得溜光。擦了一臉的白粉。身上穿了花布長旗袍。一擺一擺的在路邊走着。伊身後跟隨着一個長衣的漢子。笑嘻嘻的同走。張二嫂不時的回轉頭來。只管和他說笑。張小三兒一見。恨不得拿起脊梁上背的槍。對着他們就是一槍。而且先把張二嫂打死。再打死跟着的那小子。可是前後都有軍官。不但不敢放槍。而且也不敢走開了大隊。只惡狠狠的望了張二嫂一眼。在他這樣望着。張二嫂也望着他了。拉了那人的手。不知道低低說了些什麽。二人就在人堆裏一鑽。走了開去了。張小三兒心裏恨極了。這小子臉子很熟。好像在那裏見過。是了。他是同胡同裏那個李次長家裏的聽差。我媳婦和他洗過衣服。原來是他拐跑了。有一天犯到老子手裏。老子總得把他槍斃。他一路想着。一路跟了大隊走。不覺已是走出了永定門。永定門外就是鄉下。不算北京了。他長了三十多歲。不料離開北京城。就是這樣一副情形。再想這一次離開北京。就是跟趙巡閱使去打仗。能回來不能回來。也說不定呢。想到這裏。少不得對身後的城墻。回轉頭來。多看了幾眼。只覺心裏有一件事怪捨不得似的。其實這城裏。由大總統以至於一百三十萬的住民。都和他没什麽關係。而且還有他的仇人和情敵呢。</p>

<h3>外匯趨勢極平</h3>
<p>昨日英美銀巿仍無變動、惟匯兌見升、殆匯豐掛牌各匯槪無升縮、至於英美日三匯内盤趨勢極平、惟金巿雖有六七兩波折、終則潛萎、但未有影響、迨結果適與隔昨無異、華商交易不甚熱鬧、計英金由大連帮等結進十餘萬鎊、銀行賣意不懈、惟至午後各號略有抛出、又美金計美商售與中日等行二十餘萬元、而日金少數向購、巿况平庸之象云、</p>

<h3>紗花紗巿緊俏</h3>
<p>▲紗銷仍然十分暢逹</p>
<p>紗巿甚堅、且漲勢甚烈、實以現紗需要日見興奮、北方一路採辦異常踴躍、本廠十六支及二十支紗均被其搜罄、一無現貨可購、改買七八月份期貨、足見各帮之熱烈也、此種狀况、完全受滙兌影響、北方向被日本紗占據、近來以滬埠紗價頗廉、而該處布銷又見起色、於是遂有大批之進量、因此賣方視各廠現貨抽空、各帮採辦接踵而來、活動抵補、塲中形勢大爲緊俏、如現銷再繼續不斷、紗價恐有發現新高價可能、中途先有一度盤旋、亦未可知、</p>

<p>▲滬南昨晨風雨交佈、各帮到貨仍屬寂寥、本街店銷更淸、作客亦少、河斛因雨、竟然無幾鮮暴續增、次乃平定、照此霉巿巿形堅穏、薄稻去路平常、洋杜尖貨雖稀少、而胃亦呆木巿形軟象、通變陰化、　作坊買進尙多、故形勢低落一角、斛開各貨六七百担、今日　廢曆端節、南北二巿停斛一天、</p>
<h3>疋頭細嗶嘰扶搖直上</h3>
<p>疋頭巿面、上漲甚速、昨日尤以細嗶嘰大有直上靑雲之勢、蓋前數日川帮搜辦已烈、昨天津長沙又形活動、兼之海外定價步步上漲、致執貨者心思奇好、昨日俱漲起一分左右、三友圖長江帮售開三錢四分七厘半、秃元亦逹三錢三分半、湖心亭三錢五分半、寶球三錢九分七厘半、古城　四錢、下身貨之千里駒·公孫圖·和樂圖等、更形見缺、直貢呢亦漲、竹虎已逹三錢一分半、三友圖東棉售開三錢五分、獵雁又見缺乏、莫千山已逹三錢八分半、司馬相如期貨長江帮進胃亦强、白地色汀白地蔴紗、前曾一度下落、現亦由跌轉漲、蓋投機者乘勢搜辦之故、色汀昨已二錢左右、蔴紗俱二錢出關矣、細布連日因本廠貨猛漲、東貨亦莫不暴跳、昨世樂鳥九兩七錢半、月雁十兩零錢半矣、</p>
<h3>南北貨金山枝歉收確息</h3>
<p>▲巿價比現巿高起三分之一</p>
<p>金山枝今庚新花稀少、歉收之說、早傳滬埠、兹據確息、鮮枝已有巿價、如果合成干菒、須照現在申巿加起三分之一、故現在申存陳貨各行均未肯賤、趨勢極爲堅挺、後巿更有漲望云、</p>
<h3>糖巿日車糖劃盤轉升</h3>
<p>昨日糖巿産區電訊、古巴現糖價爲一·三四三七五、比較前電微升三一二五、紐約期糖九月份價一·三○、十二月份一·三九、明年三月份一·四六、五月份一·五三、比前各升三分、惟三月份升二分、爪哇期糖依然無更動、公會巿塲劃盤、荷糖二十四號買氣殊靜、出戶喊價十一兩七錢、二十號中砂白十一兩一錢、均少問津、十號荷赤九兩九錢七分半、貨且不高、而巿氣甚挺、日糖巿見微升、Ｚ嘜十一兩二錢半、ＳＨ嘜十一兩一錢半、ＴＭ嘜十一兩二錢二分半、ＹＴ嘜十一兩三錢至三錢二分半、ＹＰ嘜十一兩七錢、ＹＰＯ嘜十兩○九錢七分半至十一兩、太古ＤＹ嘜十一兩二錢至二錢半、Ｂ嘜十一兩半、巿形頗强、出戶更復喊高、但買方却步不前、尙具相持不下之槪云</p>
<h3>五金英馬口鐵客銷漸旺</h3>
<p>英馬口鐵交易、本街生意十分蕭條、故各同業均轉意於客帮生意、近來如天津·靑島·烟台·哈爾濱等忽見興旺、因此人心漸好、行情有扶搖直上之勢、刻估十五兩七錢（九十磅）、及十六兩二錢半（一百磅）、比前已覺好起一錢半、聞昨日成交共有五六百箱之多云、</p>
<h3>雜訊茶葉五千三百箱裝赴歐洲</h3>
<p>▲野絲絲頭二百六十件、由烟台等處運到上海、</p>

<h3>看了「說謊者」之後</h3>
<p>— 敬齋</p>
<p>說到戲劇兩字、不禁要使我們聯想到所謂戲劇的年頭兒——剛過去的民國十九年度來、在這一年裏、戲劇運動眞是盛極一時了、雖然這番努力的結果、並没有給我們以滿足的成就、但這也未始不是給了我們一點關於戲劇運動方面的新的啓示、這、在咱們樣樣都是落人之後的幼稚的藝壇方面、尤其是戲劇藝術方面、總是一個值得忻然樂觀的事實吧、但是在什麽都是不幸的我國、似乎在各方面都是有着一個神在主宰着的、一切的事業、只是有一種曇花一現的命運、我們的戲劇運動、也是没曾度過這層關煞而隨着戲劇的年頭兒之過去而終於没落了、這是多麽的使一般有心人在哀傷喲、</p>
<p>在最近、——戲劇運動的呼聲沉默了許久許久之後的最近、我們這個幾經挫折的運動、又在各方面暗施活動起來了、這種趨勢的奔放、大有形成一種復活或是中興的現象、最先據我們所知道的、有菁莪劇社的公演「一片愛國心」、中公劇社的公演「梅羅香」、素霓劇社的正在準備公演、這都足以表示出一種蓬勃的氣象、尤其是復旦劇社的第十一次公演的「說謊者」、爲其中之最著而規模之最大的、</p>
<p>復旦劇社、正如他們自已所說的「慢慢地由游藝的性質、　化爲純粹的研究戲劇藝術的團體、」他們之所以有此成績的原故、實在是由於他們的環境——復旦大學有的是努力研究學術空氣、和復旦大學所開的關於戲劇課程之完備、以此、他們在這種先天頗厚的原素裏、就産生了一個哄動一時膾炙人口的「西哈諾」孩子、繼這個孩子而被胎生下來、那就是現在我所要談的其聲名也不弱於他的哥哥「西哈諾」的這次公演的「說謊者」了、</p>
<p>「說謊者」據說是英國的一位十足的喜劇家瓊斯的一部最完美最無瑕疲的作品、我們顧名思義來說、當然在這劇戲裏所表現出來的是些「說謊」的事實了、但是也不盡然、現在爲了便於讀者易於明瞭起見、在此我也不妨來爲它作個簡要的說明、</p>
<p>事情的起因、是爲了一位剛從南洋來上海的張景凱先生和海上巨商葉孟華先生的太太之間、發生了一個青年們常在演着的戀愛的故事、自然這件事情是爲他們兩方面的朋友親好所不直的、他們都想出了許多的方法來規勸這兩位主人翁、但結果、規勸是失敗了的、過後凑巧的在一個旅館裏、這兩位戀愛者相遇了、自然這裏的所說的凑巧也不過是一個謊話罷了、同時更巧的、葉太太的夫弟這時也來了、於是這個事情就要閙大了、他們倆的朋友、在這裏爲了要拯救這兩位主人翁起見、於是在精細的商酌之下才决定了一個以自圓其說的謊話、但不幸的、謊話又宣告了拆穿、這樣、幾乎把這件事弄到不可收拾的境地、可是那聰明的、閱世已深、什麽都懂得、什麽都明白的朋友林望仙先生、却在這時、把握着時機、一點兒也不肯放鬆的來利用它、終使這一對快到破裂之途的夫婦、又復言歸於好、而那本來是英雄的敢作敢爲的熱戀者的張景凱先生、也從戀愛的迷夢中覺醒了過來、知道在他的肩背上、有比戀愛更爲重大的任務、而就結束了自已浪漫的把戲、</p>
<p>雖然這個劇本的内容、是有如斯之多的曲折轉變、但僅分作四幕就已完全的把它的傳達出來了、所以在它的每一幕中、却都埋藏着不少的緊張的情味、所以如果我們只是站在戲劇的立塲來說話、那麽這個「說謊者」實在是一部很完美的有引人入勝的魔力底好作品、但如果我們是以爲藝術的作品之成功、須要把握着時代的精神、能夠使它促起一種社會的效能的話、那麽這個「說謊者」、也不過是一個平平的習見的故事吧了、它除了在技術方面獲得了相當的效果外、它却並没有再表現出它有若何的偉大的意義來、這是爲的我們在這戲裏面、並没有給我們找出一個出奇的偉大的人物和神蹟來、這裏面的每一個人物和每一件事故、只是都在那個强韌而頑固的傳統的社會道德的網裏打滾、這未免是要使人感到有些可惜的、</p>
<p>關於這個「說謊者」的劇情方面的話、在上面我總算是說過些了、現在我們再來說說關於其他方面的、</p>
<p>一本戲的成績之好壞、其關係於演員者、我想可以不用我來多說、這是誰都知道的是第一樁重要的事項、這次在「說謊者」中的幾位演員、我們作整個的觀察時、這確乎是很難能的、足以當得整齊和都不差的批評、但如果我們要作個别的批判時、那麽先要被我提到的、到不是兩位主角、而却是一個要角、飾林望仙的唐玄凡君了、此君扮的一位鬼蜮居士、雖然據說還是一個嘗試、但我們已不能不承他是已達到了成功的境地了、雖然我們也不能說他是盡善盡美、他的說白是多麽的周到和流利、他的舉止是多麽的安閒和瀟洒、到處都顯示出了他是一位胸有成竹老於世故的人物、同時、他又帶着很不少的有趣味的表情、這個角色、實在是太合式了、這是這許多演員中最出羣拔萃的一個、其次要說的、那當然就是飾葉太太的女主角李蓮女士了、李女士的確也是一位不可多得的富有舞台天才的人物、她這次在這個戲内、所扮的角色、也還很能得體、她除掉說話說得太快了些和一切的舉止行動、都犯上了一個過於浮燥的毛病外、其他的什麽、都是還能給人以一個滿意的安慰的、提起梁培玉女士、那麽我們總該還記得起那位在「西哈諾」中的女主角來吧、是的、這是位態度非常大方和鎭靜、表情非常細膩和周到、說白非常的圓潤和清朗的全才、所可惜的、因爲她在劇中所處的地位、不見得十分重要、所以我們未能盡量來瞻仰她所有的長處、還有其他的幾位女士、也都還能做來頭頭是道、適合她們自已在局中的地位、雖然小疵的地方、也是免不掉的、尤以飾馬小姐的吕曼云女士、她的面部表情、允稱上乘、尤以一付媚眼爲甚、但可惜她的態度太欠端莊了些、也犯上了過火的毛病、不免有失做小姐的幽默的含羞的情態、這如果是換做了一個善於媚人的、慣於賣弄風情的女子的時候、那麽這個表情、是要被讚賞不已的、男角方面、大體講來、都還能稱職、不過如飾張景凱的吳衷民君的面部表情是太少了些、在他的臉上總是一股子的腔調、很少機會能使人辨得出他有喜怒哀樂的表情來、這是他個人的大缺點、假如飾葉孟華的孔令珏君、在這許要角中、他程度是比較地要最差些了、總之、這次的演員之整齊、總算是很難得有的了、</p>
<p>我們知道劇社運動的意義和使命、不僅是只在技巧方面的成熟、就算了事的、其最大而且最重要的意義、還是在要它能夠發生出一種社會的效果來、所以在這裏、凡是我們努力於戲劇運動的同志們、都得要知道我們的成功、是在多方面的、是含有一個中心意識的、表演的吻合、劇情的美妙和深粤這到還是個次要的問題哩、以此徵諸於復旦劇社諸君子、其亦以爲然否、</p>

<p>resolve all disputes. Tang Shaoyi also said that if the dispute can be resolved, the Guangdong government can be abolished. The central government has always been broad-minded. The Fifth Plenary Session only decided on the policy of suppressing bandits. It still advocates peace for Guangdong. Chairman Chiang has indicated that he will not use force, or will send someone else to Guangdong for negotiations. If the Guangdong military takes any action, it will become a national problem for China. Zhan Tang is idle in Nanjing. Chiang and Hu understand each other very well. My trip to Guangdong is to make a spiritual mediation, not a conditional negotiation. Political disputes are inevitable in all countries. China has always used military means to resolve politics, resulting in disputes. The central government is determined to resolve the Guangdong issue through political or party methods. It hopes that Li Jishen will help more. In addition to the original members of the Central Political Council and the National Committee, no inauguration ceremony will be held for the newly appointed members. The new committee members will be inaugurated at a later date. Because I have a sick person at my residence in Peiping, I will not leave Peiping for the time being. (Special telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Ji passed through Tianjin at 7 a.m. on the 19th to go to Peiping. He told reporters that he had no mission in going north. In addition to consoling Deputy Commander Zhang, I am returning to Peiping to see my family because someone is sick. The situation in Guangdong is very good. The general laborers and women have a deep understanding of the Kuomintang, so the Communist Party has disappeared from Guangdong. They welcome Wang Jingwei and reject dangerous elements, and are also suspicious of Chen Youren. Wang and Tang Shaochuan said that Chiang does not need to step down. Let's do our own thing. We want to implement the Prime Minister's six-year tutelage plan and implement democratic construction. Let's see whose achievements are better in the future. Li Delin and Bai Jiansheng said that we are all members of the Kuomintang and follow the Prime Minister's teachings. We will not overthrow Chiang. We will all work hard on the road of construction to see the future achievements. Nanjing will not send troops, and Guangdong will not send troops either. However, Mr. Wang still hopes that other party members will go to Guangdong to discuss everything. There may be a possibility of holding a peace conference in Shanghai in the future. I think that the Guangdong incident is due to the different political views of the comrades of the Kuomintang, so both Nanjing and Guangdong have issued telegrams with a peaceful attitude. I have told the comrades in Guangdong to preserve peace in the south and not to set fire in the north, because the imperialists are always hoping for chaos in China. If a rebellion occurs in the north, the imperialists will seek benefits in the three northeastern provinces. This is very dangerous. Finally, Zhang instructed the representatives of the municipal party headquarters to pay attention to peace and not to scold when publishing texts on Guangdong in the future. (Special telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>Cheng Tianfang Goes West Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Cheng Tianfang, the Chairman of the Party Affairs Committee for the Bandit Suppression Zone of the Headquarters' Executive Office, took a ship west at 11 a.m. on the 19th, along with Mei Lingao, Yu Baiqing, and Shi Guangde of the Central Propaganda Department, and Hu Liduo of the Central Training Department, to work together. (Special telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>The Central Government Plans to Formulate Measures to Restrict Foreign Missionaries</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the measures for reviewing Christian organizations, the Central Government had appointed Chen Lifu and Wang Zhengting to jointly review the issue with the three ministers of the Central Propaganda and Training Departments. It is heard that the result is that the original name seems too narrow, and it has been decided to change it to "Measures for Guiding Foreign Religious Groups." All foreigners who preach in China must be guided by the Party Headquarters and supervised by the government. There shall be no propaganda that violates the Three Principles of the People, and nine measures are planned to restrict them. (Special telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>The National Government Rewards the Panchen Lama</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government believes that the Panchen Lama sincerely supports the Central Government and believes in the Three Principles of the People. He also made many suggestions on resolving the Tibetan issue during his visit to Nanjing. He has been specially awarded the title of "Great Master of Protecting the Country and Promoting Civilization" and a gold seal has been cast for him. In addition, a gold ruler will be made, engraved with the Panchen Lama's biography and the reasons for the award. The decree will be promulgated soon. (Special telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Reports on the Recent Diplomatic Situation</h3>
<p>Embassies to Be Established in Poland and Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>The Guangdong Issue Has No Impact on Diplomacy</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting received reporters from various newspapers inside and outside Nanjing at 11 a.m. on the 19th in the main hall of the ministry, reporting on the recent diplomatic situation as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the Shanghai French Concession issue, negotiations have made great progress in recent days. The content is handled entirely in accordance with the method negotiated by myself and French Minister Wilden. It will be taken over as soon as the arrangements are completed next month. (2) The Sino-Polish Treaty and Additional Protocol have been promulgated and will take effect from July 9th. Now that Poland and Czechoslovakia have both sent ministers to China, our country is also planning to establish embassies in the capitals of Poland and Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>(3) Minister Wu Tiecheng has resigned, and the National Government has approved it. The affairs of the embassy will be temporarily handled by Rong Kui. According to the resignation of Minister Wu, it has no impact on diplomacy. The United States and other countries have full confidence in China in diplomacy. Since the Guangdong incident occurred, various countries have taken a friendly attitude towards the Chinese government, so the Guangdong incident has no impact on diplomacy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is still handling the recovery of concessions, leased territories, and other cases of abolishing unequal treaties in stages according to the steps previously determined. As for Minister Wu's participation in the Guangdong affair, since he has resigned and his relationship with the National Government has been severed, it is tentatively decided not to punish him for the time being. In the future, he may be included in the Guangdong Incident case of the Fifth Plenary Session and sent to the Central Supervisory Committee for investigation and handling. In addition, the selection of a successor to the British Minister is currently underway at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After the report was completed, the meeting was adjourned. (Special telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, Han Zai reported at a meeting to encourage the provincial government that the province's monthly fiscal revenue is 2 million yuan, and expenditure is 1.6 million yuan. (Special telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>Feng Yifei's Illness Slightly Relieved</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Feng Yifei's illness has slightly improved. He can now eat a little bread and milk. It is heard that Chiang has approved a leave of absence for him to recuperate temporarily. (Special telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Feng Yifei's condition is as before. Fourteen lower-ranking officials of Feng's department went to the Central Hospital, willing to donate blood to supplement Feng. After medical examination, the blood of eleven people was not compatible, and the blood of three people was compatible. Yesterday afternoon, Feng suddenly felt anxious and repeatedly tossed and turned in bed. Liu Ruiheng feared that Feng's movement would disturb his internal organs, so he invited the brothers Niu Huisheng, famous doctors from Shanghai, as well as German doctor Potter, American doctor Zhong Mose, and Chinese doctors Wang Zhongqi and Yun Tieqiao to conduct separate examinations this morning. The results showed that there were no new ulcers in the surgical area and that his pulse was also strong. If no other diseases develop, there is no danger. They also advised Feng's family not to be anxious. (Special telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>Special Tribunal for Foreign Nationals</h3>
<p>Detention Facilities Adopt Separate Room System</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the organization of the Special Tribunal for Foreign Nationals, all places of imprisonment, detention and detention of foreigners adopt a separate room system. The Ministry of Judicial Administration ordered the addition of several separate rooms with a volume of 25 cubic meters in the local prisons, and strictly demarcated the two parts of imprisonment and detention. The detention place is a part of the detention place. In the colder provinces of the north, all prisons are equipped with heating pipes, and there are budget regulations for prisoners' food, hygiene and other expenses. (Special telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in Honghu Are Being Forced into a Tight Spot</h3>
<p>Fan Shisheng's Troops Pursue and Suppress He's Bandits</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military news: The remaining bandits in Honghu have been attacked by a part of the 48th Division and the Garrison Brigade.

<h3>The European Situation in the Coming Months</h3>
<p>Today, both Britain and Germany announced that British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Henderson are scheduled to visit Germany on the 17th of next month for a return visit. Before going to Germany, Henderson will first go to Geneva to meet with the foreign ministers of all European countries to discuss matters. US Secretary of State Stimson will also go to Germany on the 21st to discuss matters. US Treasury Secretary Mellon has already arrived in London and had some discussions with the British Prime Minister. Therefore, both Berlin and Geneva will have meetings on the European situation, and the problems between Europe and the United States will also be resolved. Therefore, it is said that the coming months will be the most critical period since the end of the European War. This is not without reason. These two meetings were initiated due to the German request to reduce reparations and resolve the war debt issue. If these meetings give hope to those who requested it, the international crisis can be eliminated and the European situation can be stabilized. If there are many obstacles in the progress and no corresponding results are achieved, the European situation may become tense or even cause a disturbance. Therefore, the coming months are a major key to changes in the European situation. The German people showed joy when they saw the news that British and American dignitaries were coming to Germany. It is very reasonable for the German newspaper to warn them not to have excessive hopes. If those who have excessive hopes today will inevitably be overly sad in the future, which is also related to the country.</p>

<p>▲ National News Agency, London, 18th - It was officially announced here today that British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Henderson are scheduled to visit Germany on July 17th. At the same time, the Geneva Daily, published in Geneva, stated that as a result of the recent meeting between British and German authorities, Henderson has already invited the foreign ministers of all European countries to meet in Geneva on July 13th. Before accompanying the Prime Minister to Germany, Henderson will first consult with the foreign ministers of all European countries. It is also expected that U.S. Secretary of State Stimson will arrive in Berlin at the same time as the British authorities visit Germany, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Mellon is currently traveling in Europe and is expected to meet with important German figures. Therefore, it is anticipated that within the next month, there may be significant action regarding Germany's request to postpone reparations payments, and the entire structure of international war debts and reparations will be discussed in Geneva and Berlin.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 18th - A public announcement was made today that British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Henderson are scheduled to arrive in Berlin on July 17th to return the visit of the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister. They will stay for several days and return to Britain on the 20th.

Furthermore, U.S. Treasury Secretary Mellon is currently in London, discussing matters with the British Prime Minister, so it is predicted that after a frank exchange of views, the discussion of the German reparations issue will proceed rapidly, and tangible results can be expected around mid-August. Regarding public opinion, although warnings are repeatedly issued not to have excessive hopes, the attitude of joy cannot be concealed, and the people view the coming months as the most crucial period since the end of the European War, hoping for a revision of the reparations plan as one would hope for rain during a severe drought.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, London, 19th - It is generally suspected that U.S. Treasury Secretary Mellon's trip to Britain is not purely for vacation purposes. Since Mellon's visits to British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Henderson yesterday, suspicions have increased. A Reuters correspondent in Paris reports that France is closely monitoring Mellon's actions. The Petit Parisien newspaper speculates that Mellon's talks indicate that he has discussed the situation in several European countries, as well as issues such as reparations and debts, with British authorities. Mellon seems to no longer advocate that the U.S. authorities should stand idly by in the face of Europe's financial difficulties. However, Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence, issued an official statement this morning denying the claim that the British government had invited Mellon to London to discuss revising war debts or other issues, saying that all such rumors are completely unfounded.</p>
<h3>Austrian New Cabinet Stillborn</h3>
<p>Austria Issues Treasury Bonds</p>
<p>British Bank Provides Loans for Assistance</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Vienna, 18th - Dr. Ender was previously unwilling to accept the mandate to form a cabinet, but now he has expressed his willingness, but with the condition that he be granted full dictatorial powers. Therefore, a special situation has arisen in the Austrian political situation. His proposal is that the parliament can be dissolved and temporarily replaced by a mixed committee organized by various parties. Ender said that without this, Austria cannot escape its current state of chaos. However, Austria's constitution is clearly different from Germany's, and the government has no power to dissolve parliament. The dissolution of parliament requires the approval of two-thirds of the members of parliament itself, so based on the current situation, it is quite unlikely to become a reality. It is expected that Ender will have to abandon his plan.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 18th - Ender has now abandoned his plan to form a cabinet as no party except his own is willing to grant him dictatorial powers.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 18th - The Bank of England has temporarily advanced four million pounds sterling to the Austrian National Bank pending the conclusion of international loan negotiations. This news is extremely welcomed by the people of Vienna, and the London financial community also approves of the Bank of England's move. German bonds suddenly rose in price on the London foreign securities market today, which is also related to the Bank of England's loan.</p>
<h3>Tribal Conflict in South Africa</h3>

<p>▲ Reuters, Johannesburg, 18th - Today, two tribes clashed in the Amusan area near Kranzkop in South Africa, with seventeen people killed and wounded on each side. The two sides have had a long-standing animosity. Today, a wedding ceremony was held in a village of Tribe A. Several women from Tribe B went to watch, but were ridiculed by the people of Tribe A. They angrily returned home, and their tribesmen immediately gathered, armed, and attacked Tribe A's village, resulting in many deaths and injuries. The unrest has now been quelled, and Tribe A has withdrawn its preparations for a counterattack, willing to have the authorities handle the matter according to law. The authorities have now arrested two of the instigators.</p>

<p>For the Sake of Maintaining American Commerce</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Moscow, 18th - Senator Borah of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee stated today at a speech for the Idaho State Bar Association that the United States should cease its unnecessary attacks on Russia, and not only that, but should also establish friendly relations with Soviet Russia.

<h3>American Press Comments on Chinese Situation</h3>
<p>Deep Regret Expressed for Wu Chaoshu's Resignation</p>
<p>▲ Associated Press, New York, 18th - The New York Bureau of the National News Agency conducted a survey today of American newspapers' views on the Chinese political and military situation, which generally tend towards peace. For example, the New York Chronicle Tribune's editorial today, discussing the divergent trends of Nanjing and Guangzhou, stated that all those who seek to promote changes in the situation and make war unavoidable cannot win the sympathy of those who wish China prosperity. We can only say that a new revolutionary group, taking advantage of incidental events, fires a propaganda cannon, and that the reasons it puts forward, though extremely important, will be ten times more important than the peace. In addition, newspapers such as the New York Evening Post and the New York Times have expressed regret for Wu Chaoshu's resignation and alignment with Guangdong.</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Able to Sit Up</h3>
<p>▲Zhang Says Rumors Quite Bizarre</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: I recently visited Tianjin Mayor Zhang Xueming to inquire about Vice Commander Zhang's recent condition. Zhang said that today (the 16th) is the 22nd day since Vice Commander Zhang fell ill and the 16th day since his admission to the hospital. This morning, he was able to sit up and look out the window, and said that the weather was very nice and he felt quite happy. Today, the Vice Commander's temperature was 37.2 degrees Celsius, not much different from usual, and his health is gradually recovering. He also often wants to eat more, but the doctor has not fully agreed, but has agreed to increase the amount of food each day. I went to the Xiehe Hospital this afternoon and reported to the Vice Commander a telegram from Chairman Chiang and Minister Song to myself and Mayor Hu, which said that they had heard of the Vice Commander's illness, and there were suggestions to have him treated by traditional Chinese medicine, but typhoid fever can be cured after a considerable period of time, so please be responsible for maintaining this position and not change to traditional Chinese medicine. Mayor Hu and I have also replied, stating that we will definitely not change to traditional Chinese medicine. After listening to my report, the Vice Commander said that the rumors outside are quite bizarre and that he plans to meet with reporters at a fixed time after his spirit recovers to give a talk so that they can understand the true situation of his illness, and then all rumors can be dispelled. From this situation, the outside world should be able to understand the true situation. (16th)</p>
<h3>Bi Demen's Arrival in Ping</h3>
<p>▲ Denies Proposing Silver Loan</p>
<p>Ping News: U.S. Senator Bi Demen of Nevada arrived in Ping on the morning of the 15th and resided at the U.S. Embassy. Yesterday (the 16th) morning, he met with the Chinese, British, and American press for about an hour. The general discussion revolved around the silver price issue in a free and informal manner, rather than a formal meeting. Mr. Bi frankly answered all inquiries, stating that since arriving in China, he has never changed his views on the silver issue and firmly advocates convening an international conference soon to discuss the matter. Mr. Bi does not trust informal meetings but emphasized that for the conference to succeed, major countries must send strong representatives. He believes that most countries now agree to this kind of conference. He still firmly believes that the drop in silver prices is due to India's sale of silver, which he considers a major cause of the global recession. Therefore, if the silver conference can achieve its main objective, it must compel the Indian government to stop selling raw silver or allow it to sell no more than a specified amount of silver annually. At the same time, Mr. Bi solemnly declared that before the conference, a detailed scope of the meeting could be determined in advance. India has about 400 million ounces of silver that needs to be dealt with. If the amount put into the market each year can be limited to 20 million or 30 million ounces, a joint venture can be formed to buy it up and stabilize the silver price above the current market price. Mr. Bi also made a surprising statement, saying that the decline in silver prices began in 1928 when India adopted its current policy. His concern for this issue is not because he represents a silver-producing area, but because the drop in value affects U.S. export trade and global commerce in general. Mr. Bi also denied that he or the Senate Finance Committee had decided on a silver loan to China, nor had he proposed the rumored 200 million or 100 million loan. This proposal may have been made by Lindbergh, but it was definitely not due to Mr. Bi or any American agency. He does not know if China needs a loan, and even if it does, he does not know if it should be in gold or silver, or a mixture of both. He also does not know if the U.S. or other countries are prepared for this and what the collateral would be. At the time, other aspects of the silver issue were also discussed, such as how certain countries reduced the fineness of silver coins after the Great War. Mr. Bi said that France and other countries are now on the right track, and newly minted coins are increasing the silver content. The issue of silver production as a byproduct was also discussed. Mr. Bi said that the world's silver production has never exceeded 250 million ounces per year, but last year it has dropped to 235 million ounces, and this year it may only reach 200 million ounces. A reporter asked what method could be used to make India abolish its policy of selling surplus silver. In response, Mr. Bi reiterated his statement that "before the conference, the scope of discussion can be determined in advance." Mr. Bi stated that during his stay in China, he is also studying other issues besides the silver problem, but they are naturally economic rather than political. Mr. Bi was deeply impressed by China's resources and vastness. His stay in Ping is scheduled to last until next Monday (the 17th).</p>
<h3>Fujian Authorities' Anti-Communist Plan</h3>
<p>▲ Stability Returning to Fuzhou</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After the communist bandits Luo Binghui, Peng Dehuai, and others from eastern Jiangxi invaded Jianning, Taining, Guangze, and Shaowu counties in northern Fujian, rumors arose. To stabilize the people's hearts, the provincial government issued a notice on the 11th to refute the rumors. It also convened a party-government meeting to decide on establishing a Provincial Defense Design Committee, a Military Supplies Design Committee, and a Propaganda Design Committee. Provincial Government Committee member Lin Zhiyuan was appointed as the chairman of the Provincial Defense Design Committee, and Provincial Government Committee member Zheng Baoqing was appointed as the chairman of the Military Supplies Design Committee. They are tasked with raising cash from the Provincial Xiamen Bank Company and wealthy merchants to fund the suppression of bandits. It is also planned to add a 25% surcharge to salt, liquor, tobacco, and customs taxes starting in June to cover expenses. Provincial Party Department Committee member Gan Yun was appointed as the chairman of the Propaganda Design Committee. He is tasked with recruiting enthusiastic anti-communist youth to form propaganda teams, which will depart for the front lines to awaken the masses and cooperate in eliminating communism and saving the country through various methods. In the provincial capital, martial law was tightened starting on the 11th. The Security Department, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Martial Law Command dispatched inspection teams and detectives to patrol in coordination, paying particular attention to public venues. Yesterday, they searched the Fuzhou, Ligong, and Yuhua middle schools, but found no suspicious individuals or reactionary documents. After the communist bandits Peng and Luo arrived in Jianshao and looted, they retreated to Guangchang and Nanfeng. Currently, only local bandits remain in those areas, causing minor disturbances, but it should not be difficult to quell them soon. Therefore, stability has gradually returned to the provincial capital. Transportation between Fuzhou and northern Fujian, via Yanping to Jian'ou, is unobstructed, and cargo transportation has returned to normal. (June 16th)</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong and Lu Diping Vigorously Implement Rural Pacification</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: To understand the bandit situation and political conditions in various counties for rural pacification purposes, Sun Lianzhong, the Jiangxi Provincial Rural Pacification Director, and Lu Diping jointly conducted an investigation into six matters related to bandit suppression in various counties. They requested that reports be submitted within ten days of receiving the document for review and action.

(2) The current number of police in the county, how they are organized, the types and numbers of firearms, and the total number. Whether the district defense groups have been established, whether they have firearms and the ability to defend themselves, and whether fortifications such as blockhouses and earthen forts have been constructed. (3) Which counties border the jurisdiction, whether the police and defense groups coordinate with each other, and detailed maps should be drawn and submitted for review. (4) Which locations and villages within the jurisdiction have been most severely ravaged by bandits, and the total number of people currently engaged in spring plowing. (5) Whether the autonomy of each township and district in the county has been fully implemented, whether there are any areas where communist disturbances have halted progress, and the extent of recent work achievements. (6) Whether a census has been conducted recently in the county, whether the registers have been lost, or whether it has not yet been conducted, and a truthful report should be submitted.

<h3>The Tragic Situation of the Disaster in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Northern Anhui is unfortunate, plagued by frequent disasters. Years of repeated warfare have damaged the local vitality. In recent months, communist bandits have risen up like swarms of bees, causing even more harm than before. In addition, floods and hailstorms have arrived one after another, and people's livelihoods are deteriorating daily, with refugees on the roads, sleeping in the open and eating in the wind. Their misery is truly indescribable. The various situations are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Banditry: There have been many bandits in northern Anhui for years. Although government troops and local militias have repeatedly suppressed and captured them, they scatter and regroup, with bandits returning after the troops leave. To this day, they have not been completely eradicated. The bandits' burning, killing, raping, and looting are also extremely cruel. The bandits in the Cai Li and Suixi areas northwest of Su County have recently been severely suppressed by Gong's regiment of the Seventh Division. After the bandit leaders Sanmao Hou and Wang Kunlun were captured, the bandit atmosphere subsided slightly. However, the Zhang Zibin gang of bandits has recently occupied and harassed the area near Sanjuesi, at the junction of Shou County, Hefei, and Liuan. The Hefei garrison has repeatedly joined forces with the police and militias of Shou and Liu counties to encircle and suppress them, but because the bandits are elusive, they have not been wiped out for the time being. In the Mahudian area in eastern Xuyi, the remnants of Ma Yuren and Jiang Guochang previously infiltrated and looted, burning down more than a hundred nearby villages. After the county police and militias advanced to suppress them, the bandits split into two groups and fled, one group hiding in the Lao Jiashan area at the junction of Ganzhu and Lai, and the other fleeing back to the Laozishan area on the shore of Hongze Lake. As for counties such as Si, Wu, Guo, Hao, Tai, and Fu, although there are scattered bandits, there is no major trouble. However, now that autumn mosquito nets are up, the bandits have cover, making suppression even more difficult.</p>
<p>▲ Communist Disaster: There have been no communist bandits in the counties of northern Anhui. Since the western border of Liuan was reduced to a communist area in recent years, communist bandits have gradually invaded the north. Last month, Xiao Fang's gang infiltrated the southern border of Huoqiu, occupying Yejiaji, Balitan, Baita Slope, Wangjia Laolou, Gujiadian, Hongjiaji, Chongxingji, Hekouji, Zhangtangshao and other places and even established a pseudo-Soviet county government at Wangjia Laolou, Wang Baozhai's house, coercing farmers to join the Red Guards. Those who refused were shot. More than a dozen villagers near Doujialou resisted and were attacked by the communist bandits, who burned them to the ground. More than a hundred residents were looted and brutally killed. Farmers in southern Huoqiu have recently fled completely, mostly gathering in Zhengyang, Shou County, Bengbu, Chuzhou and other places to beg for food, sleeping in the open and eating in the wind, which is very pitiful. It is now heard that the Liuan garrison has advanced towards Huoqiu to join forces with friendly forces to suppress them. Chen Tiaoyuan, the chairman of Anhui, will also personally go to Liuan to supervise the troops and launch a major offensive. It should not be difficult to eliminate them soon.</p>
<p>▲ Floods: Northern Anhui is in the Huai River basin, the soil is fertile, and the main crops are wheat and soybeans. In years of good harvest, wheat and soybeans are mostly sold to provinces in the north and south. Unexpectedly, this summer, when the wheat seedlings were heading, there were continuous rains for more than ten days. The water level of the Huai River rose sharply by more than ten feet. The wheat seedlings along the Huai River in Huaiyuan, Fengtai, Shou County, Huoqiu and other counties were flooded by one-third. Those that were not flooded were also dying due to waterlogging. Therefore, the wheat harvest this summer was greatly reduced. According to the victims who came to Bengbu from Shou, Feng and other counties, when the Huai River water rose, Shou County removed the attached moat dam outside the north gate, causing sixty miles of land at the junction of the two counties to become a swamp, and the fields were flooded. The northern border of Huoqiu was also a vast ocean, and the farmers suffered heavy losses. The fellow villagers associations in Shou, Feng and Huo have been appealing on behalf of the victims, requesting disaster relief.</p>
<p>▲ Hailstorms: This year, the counties of northern Anhui that suffered hailstorms were Su and Tai. On the 31st of last month, several districts of Su County experienced hailstorms, and the affected areas suffered heavy losses. The situation was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Taihe was also hit by hailstorms on the same day. The area affected by hailstorms stretched from Lixingji in the east to Qiugou on the border of Henan in the west, and from Jinjiamiao in Cishengji in the north to Guizhai in Majiaji in the south, spanning more than thirty miles in each direction. All the fields were destroyed by the wind and hail, and many people and livestock were killed. Between Zaoshuzhuang and Wangjiazhuang, a huge hailstone fell, more than ten feet long, and four or five people could not lift one end of it. The severity of the disaster can be imagined. The Su and Tai counties have now organized hailstorm relief committees and sent personnel to investigate the disaster situation in order to provide relief. (June 18th)</p>
<h3>Song People Again Request Strict Prohibition of Quarrying in Jiufeng</h3>
<p>Songjiang Correspondence: The Song people have repeatedly requested a prohibition on quarrying in Jiufeng Mountain, as it greatly affects scenic spots, historical sites, tombs, farmland, water conservancy, etc. However, the order has not yet been implemented. It is now heard that Cai Guangyao of the Songjiang Chamber of Commerce, Lu Longxiang of the Public Funds Management Office, Zhang Kaiqi of the Grain Storage Management Office, Zhang Fusun of the Pawnbrokers Association, and citizen Geng Daochong have submitted a memorial to the National Government and the Provincial Government, requesting that the area be organized and protected, and that quarrying be permanently prohibited. The text is as follows: Submitting a memorial requesting the verification and determination of the Jiufeng Mountains within the jurisdiction of Song County as scenic spots and historical sites that should be organized and protected, and requesting the Ministry to revoke the fraudulently obtained mining rights and permanently prohibit the quarrying of mountain stones, in order to comply with official orders. It is reported that the Jiufeng Mountains within the territory of Song County are divided into Songjiang and Qingpu counties. In the past, some profit-seeking people have purchased mountain land from the Shatian Official Property Bureau to organize quarrying companies. They have arbitrarily destroyed scenic spots, historical sites, ancient tombs, and ancestral shrines, regardless of everything. Ownerless tombs have bones flying everywhere, which is unbearable to witness. The villagers Zhang Fukang and others, Zhu Cao and others, and Daochong and others have successively submitted memorials to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, ordering the county to investigate and handle the matter. It is now heard that the National Internal Affairs Conference of the Ministry of Internal Affairs has resolved to organize ancient sites and scenic spots in various places to enhance public entertainment. The decree has been submitted to your esteemed office with instruction number 1040, and the Ministry has been ordered to comply. In addition, the National Representative Conference passed Article 58 of Chapter 5 of the Provisional Constitution, which states that the state should protect or preserve ancient sites and objects of historical culture and art. The National Government has also promulgated and implemented it. It is found that the mountains of Song County originate from the Tianmu Mountains in Hangzhou and immerse themselves in the Canghai Sea. The smoke and waves are extremely interesting. Phoenix Mountain is at the head of Jiufeng, extending its neck and spreading its wings, like a phoenix soaring. There are ancient pine trees and wisteria vines on it, which are lovely. Sheshan is in the west, with two peaks extending for several miles, with monasteries hidden among them. Gan Mountain is like a heavenly horse, the highest mountain in Song County. There are many Buddhist temples on the mountain, and there are many tourists in the spring. Jishan has ponds in front of it, with scattered houses, and the banks are hidden, like a painting. Hengyun Mountain has deep ravines and is lush with trees. There are many ancient tombs in the mountains, which are particularly secluded. Little Kunshan is round and moist, overlooking the Liu River. Xueshan faces Sheshan, shaped like a jade screen. Kugong Mountain is a solitary peak, with misty water. The above mountains were places where famous people in Song County in ancient times lived in seclusion and read books. Or they have been passed down as ancient sites, which cannot be fully enumerated. In addition to the prefectural and county chronicles, there is also a special book called the Jiufeng Zhi to record them. It can be imagined that there are many scenic spots. Although they are now in decline due to changes in the world and lack of protection, there are still many relics to be found when exploring and searching for scenic spots. If the government and the people can cooperate to organize and protect them, and attract tourists to visit, it will greatly help promote inherent culture and enhance public entertainment. Moreover, the Shatian Official Property Bureau of Song, Jin and Qing approved the cases of mountain land leases, all based on the declarations of the lessees that the purpose was to donate to the party department for the construction of public houses, to preserve tombs, or to plant trees or cultivate land. The former Jiangsu Shatian Official Property Affairs Bureau instructed the lessees that they should not engage in quarrying. Unexpectedly, after receiving the Ministry's license, the lessees sought huge profits and did not follow the original purpose. They fraudulently applied to the department and county for approval to use all the leased mountain land as mining areas in order to obtain mining rights by fraudulent means, arbitrarily and recklessly, regardless of everything. This is completely contrary to the provisions of Article 41, Paragraph 3, and Article 108, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Mining Law. Therefore, the Jiufeng Mountains map and chronicle, as well as the original memorials and the original case of Jiang Erchang and others leasing mountain land, are submitted for your esteemed office to review and verify. Please approve the verification and determination of the Jiufeng Mountains as scenic spots and historical sites that should be organized, and request the Ministry to revoke the fraudulently obtained mining rights. Investigate and determine that all quarrying companies in the Jiufeng Mountains shall be permanently prohibited from quarrying, and order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to specifically instruct the Song and Qing counties to handle the matter quickly. It is submitted to the National Government Executive Yuan President Jiang with great respect, in addition to submitting a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>

<h3>Wuhu Quick News</h3>
<p>▲ Guangde, Si'an, and other counties in the border area between Anhui and Zhejiang have long been infested with bandits. Due to the issue of provincial boundaries, the bandits often scatter and regroup when suppressed. To fundamentally eliminate the bandits, the authorities of the two provinces have decided to establish a joint Anhui-Zhejiang border area bandit suppression headquarters in Guangde, with Xu Yanyun, the commander of the 57th Division, as the commander-in-chief, assisted by a deputy from a Zhejiang military regiment.</p>

<p>The Case of Dismantling Gangheng Submitted to the Department for Approval: The Gangheng in front of the county government is wide and spacious, occupying the main street. Carriages and horses gallop around, often causing danger. Local merchants and people have requested its demolition, citing obstruction of traffic and hindrance to commerce, but their requests have not been approved. The current County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee convened a county-wide representative assembly, which proposed its demolition and unanimously passed the proposal. All the representatives personally went to the county government to meet the county magistrate and requested immediate implementation of the proposal. However, the case was discussed at the county government meeting and decided to build it. Whether or not it should be demolished should still be submitted to the county government meeting for resolution. Yesterday (the 18th), the 112th county government meeting approved the Secretariat of the Fourth Representative Assembly's letter requesting the demolition of the Gangheng in front of the government to facilitate traffic, based on the resolution.</p>
<p>Regarding how to handle the case, it was resolved that whether the request of the county-wide representative assembly to demolish it immediately is legal should be submitted to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval and compliance, and a reply should be sent to inform them.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Food Management Committee: The county's Food Management Committee was established earlier in accordance with provincial orders, and Yao Linjiang, Li Zuhua, Zhang Kaiqi, Wu Qianmei, Yu Yunding, and others were appointed as members.

As member Yu Yunding resigned, Zhou Yue was appointed to succeed him. It was then resolved that the county magistrate would be the chairman of the committee. However, as the county magistrate is extremely busy with county government matters, whether to establish another director to be responsible for handling affairs was discussed. Zhang Kaiqi was elected to serve as the receiving director. The address of the committee is still set at the warehousing committee, and the seal is currently borrowed from the warehousing management committee. It will be corrected after the official issuance.</p>

For the collection officials with larger arrears, the situation may be taken into account and repayment may be made in installments. If they are still tired of playing around, the deposit will be auctioned off to offset the arrears. As for the arrears under the name of the collector, they are also ordered to clear the accounts clearly within three months to value public funds.</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>County Prison Construction Tender: The original Changshu County prison, located in the old county site, is dilapidated and cramped, with extremely crowded inmates, which is detrimental to hygiene. County Magistrate Tan specially obtained approval from the High Court to raise funds for reconstruction. Now, the High Court has forwarded the revised prison blueprints from the Ministry of Justice to the county. Therefore, a tender will be announced immediately to start construction, hoping for early completion. It is said that the highest bid price is 22,000 silver dollars.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Fraudulent Official Arrested and Sent to County for Trial: Zhu Ruixiang, a resident of Yangshuyuan in the fourteenth district of this county, is from a well-to-do family. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, two men posing as secret investigators from the Department of Civil Affairs suddenly arrived, entered his house to search for opium, overturned chests, and searched arbitrarily. When Zhu's wife saw this, she suspected they were bandits and tried to escape by looking out the window, resulting in serious injuries. The neighbors heard the commotion and immediately beat gongs to alert the authorities. Xue Funan, the captain of the police team stationed at Gedaiqiao, upon hearing the alarm, led police officers, armed with rifles, to the scene. They saw two men, one wearing a suit and the other wearing student attire, searching inside. They were immediately arrested and interrogated. One claimed to be Jiang Yaoxian, a 26-year-old from Zhongshiqiao in this county, who previously worked as a gun repairman in the Department of Civil Affairs. The other claimed to be Liu Zhiheng, a 25-year-old from Shandong. Captain Xue, based on the confessions, reported to Qian Tianxiong, the captain of the water patrol team, who dispatched police to escort the two criminals to the city and send them to the brigade headquarters. Yesterday, Battalion Commander Wang prepared a document to transfer them to the county government for trial, it is said.</p>
<p>Rice and Bean Industry Requests Exemption from Re-levied Business Tax: The Rice and Bean Industry Association of this county believes that since various businesses already pay tooth tax (brokers' tax) and obtain licenses to operate, according to Article 10 of the Business Tax Law as amended and passed by the 145th session of the National Government Legislative Yuan, there is no need to re-levy the tax. The Business Tax Bureau of this county misinterpreted the law, exceptionally re-levying the tax and repeatedly urging the industry to pay the business tax, which is inappropriate. Moreover, the pawnshop tax and slaughter tax have been approved according to law and follow the original tax rate. The tooth tax should be treated as one entity; how can it be different? Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the county government, requesting that the Finance Bureau be instructed to forward the request to the provincial authorities, urging them not to re-levy the tax in order to maintain the law and alleviate the difficulties of Jiangsu merchants.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Difficult to Resolve Business Tax Subscription: The subscription of business tax by various industries in Wu County has been repeatedly discussed in meetings convened by the County Chamber of Commerce with leaders of various industries. Although the total amount identified by more than 30 industries reached 20,000 yuan, it is still far from the amount agreed with the province. Zhang Baochen, the provincial committee member in Changzhou, is waiting to resolve the issue and has repeatedly urged the Business Tax Bureau to determine the subscription issue, and requested that the subscription amount must reach at least 70,000 yuan, otherwise it can only be handled in accordance with the collection procedures. On the 18th, He Kaifang, the director of the Business Tax Bureau, again sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it convene various industries for a final consultation. If various industries can make an effort to increase the amount and put together 50,000 yuan, plus about 20,000 yuan from non-industry shops and townships, to make a total of more than 70,000 yuan, then the provincial committee can be reported, and merchants can save many troubles. The County Chamber of Commerce believes that the business tax subscription is different from apportioned donations. If various industries cannot increase the amount, they can only allow it to be collected. Therefore, this issue is not easy to resolve. The Chamber of Commerce plans to convene a meeting of various industries again within the next few days for a final consultation, but the difference in the recognized amount is too large, it is said.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>First District Strives for Charity Funds: The township heads and deputy heads of the First District are eagerly seeking the transfer of the charity funds and properties originally held by the Gongshan Hall to the Relief Institute.

(4) If agencies depositing funds in the Farmers Bank urgently need funds and are temporarily unable to turn around, they may pledge their deposit books to the Farmers Bank to apply for loans, but the maximum loan amount shall not exceed 90% of the amount in the deposit book.</p>
<p>Construction Engineering Office Sets Deadline for Grave Relocations: The Provincial Capital Construction Engineering Office has now decided to build a road from the North Gate to Beigushan and will begin construction soon. The land needed on both sides of the road has already been demarcated by the office. However, there are many graves in the open spaces on both sides, and if they are not relocated, it will hinder the work.

Currently, the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce has borrowed 60,000 yuan, the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce has borrowed 30,000 yuan, but the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce has not yet agreed to lend the money.</p>

Subsequently, the company's Taizhou branch sent a ship to tow them to Yancheng, reported to the authorities for inspection. It was also learned that Yang Hanshi, the accountant of Dada, was struck in the back. Because the Jiangtai ship was worth a thousand yuan, he could not care about anything else. Therefore, the accountant Zhang Liangcai was spared from being attacked.</p>

At 9:00 PM on the 15th, Trial Judge Ji held a trial. According to Chang Tianshun's testimony, he is 60 years old, lives in Lingqiao Town, works as a merchant, and has two daughters. The eldest daughter is already married. Xiao Cunzi is my second daughter and is engaged to someone. She is 19 years old this year, with her birthday in October. I don't know when she had a relationship with Yang Xipeng. On the evening of the 25th of this month according to the lunar calendar, she suddenly took away a gold hairpin, a gold ring, and a bank note for 80 yuan. Later, I investigated and found out that she had fled to Yang's house. I went to look for her, but Yang Xipeng threatened me with a pistol. So I reported to the Public Security Substation. Officer Song led the police to search his house and found the opium paraphernalia and bullets. According to Xiao Cunzi's testimony, she is 19 years old, with her birthday in October. She has had a relationship with Yang Xipeng for four months, more than a dozen times in total, all at his house. He usually smokes opium. On the evening of the 25th, he tricked me into going to his house. I brought a gold hairpin, a gold ring, and a bank note for 80 yuan. Later, I wanted to go home, but he threatened me with a pistol and wouldn't let me go home. He has already taken away the gold ring. According to witnesses Chang Hucun, village official Xia Mingde, and Xiao Cunzi's uncle Xue Fengchao, their testimonies are the same as Chang Shuntian's. According to Yang Xipeng's testimony, he is 31 years old, lives in Lingqiao Town, and is in the education field. He previously served in the general affairs section of the Administrative Bureau. I have not had a relationship with Xiao Cunzi. I don't smoke opium, and I don't have a pistol, only a shotgun for self-defense, and I have a gun license. On the evening of the 25th, I was wandering on the street and heard that someone was searching my house. I was very surprised and went home. I saw Xiao Cunzi inside my house. I asked her what she was doing there. She said she was borrowing rice and heard someone shouting and making noise outside, afraid it was bandits, so she hid here. At that time, Officer Song suddenly came with the police to arrest me. I don't know about the guns, bullets, and opium paraphernalia. Chang Tianshun has a grudge against me and is trying to harm me. After the interrogation, Chang Tianshun was ordered to sign a guarantee to take Xiao Cunzi back and strictly supervise her. Yang Xipeng was detained first.</p>

At that time, the Ministry advised the Zhejiang Provincial Government to raise and allocate the accumulated education expenses and ordered him to continue in his full-time position and not resign again. Now that the Zhejiang Province has allocated the accumulated education expenses for each month of this year, the Department Head's planned projects can be gradually advanced. He should continue to work hard to complete the task. Therefore, he is ordered to return to the Department immediately and carefully plan and actively carry out all educational facilities in Zhejiang Province, thereby fulfilling the Ministry's earnest expectations.</p>

Now that the accumulated education expenses in Zhejiang Province have been allocated by your government, the Department Head should return to the Department immediately and continue to work hard to complete the task. He has been ordered to comply. However, it was found that teachers and staff of Provincial Second, Sixth, and Tenth Middle Schools have telegraphed at different times, stating that Zhang Daofan, the head of the Zhejiang Department of Education, has resigned and requesting that a successor be appointed as soon as possible. The appointment of the Department Head is at the discretion of the central government, and the request is inappropriate and has been rejected. Recently, a telegram was sent to the Ministry in the name of the Zhejiang Provincial Middle School Teachers and Staff Federation, presenting the same situation as before. It has been found that the teachers and staff are interfering with the selection of educational administrative officials even after the government has issued an explicit order to retain him, which is absurd. This Ministry previously approved a letter from the Central Training Department stating that the Jiangxi Provincial Middle and Higher Education Teachers and Staff Federation had no legal basis and was considered an illegal organization, and ordered the Jiangxi Department of Education to stop the association's activities and instructed them to handle its dissolution. The situation of the Zhejiang Provincial Middle School Teachers and Staff Federation is the same and should be handled in the same way. Your government is advised to investigate, promptly stop the association's activities, and order it to dissolve in accordance with the law. We hope you will inform us of the handling situation. Sincere respects.</p>

<h3>Negotiations on the National Goods Market Case Began Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Discuss Further on a Selected Date to Resolve the Matter</p>
<p>▲Western Director and Others Visited the Site Yesterday for Inspection</p>
<p>The case of the National Goods Market being forced to close by the Public Concession Bureau has not yet been resolved as of yesterday. The City Chamber of Commerce convened both parties for talks, but due to lack of time, no results were achieved. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>▲Negotiation Situation: The City Chamber of Commerce convened negotiations at the association at 4:00 PM yesterday.

I assessed that the angle between the submarine and the Yu Da remained almost unchanged, and the distance between the two vessels was closing rapidly. In order to avoid a collision, in accordance with Articles 19 and 22 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (Article 19 states that when two vessels are approaching each other head-on or nearly head-on, and one vessel sees the other on her starboard side, she shall keep out of the way of the other to avoid collision; Article 22 states that any vessel which is required to keep out of the way of another shall, so far as possible, take positive early action to comply with this obligation, and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel), I immediately turned the helm to starboard to give way, intending to pass behind the submarine, and sounded one short blast on the whistle. During this time, my actions were as described above. When the two vessels were very close, the submarine suddenly changed course and moved back from the vessel's port side to starboard. This imminent danger of collision was solely due to the submarine's unexpected maneuver. For safety reasons, I immediately engaged full astern, sounding three short blasts on the whistle, and turned the helm hard over. However, at 12:12 PM on June 9, the midship section of the submarine's starboard side collided with the bow of the Yu Da vessel. The location of the collision was at 37 degrees 43 minutes north latitude and 122 degrees 16 minutes east longitude. The weather at the time was fair but not very clear, with visibility of approximately four nautical miles. After the collision, I immediately stopped the engines and sounded the distress signal, using all possible means to assist the submarine's crew. The submarine quickly sank. After searching the area, a total of 25 survivors were rescued and transferred to the submarine's supply ship. At 5:12 PM, after another British warship arrived at the scene, the Yu Da departed for Niuzhuang, arriving at 6:00 PM on the 10th. The bow of the Yu Da sustained minor damage. Yu Da Captain, Jia Shi Zhongzhong.</p>
<p>▲ Translation of the Signed Exchange Document Between the Two Captains: (1) Letter from the Yu Da Captain to the Submarine Captain: At noon, the submarine was sighted on the Yu Da's starboard side at a distance of approximately four nautical miles. The Yu Da's course was 42 degrees northwest. At 12:08, the bearing of the submarine was measured to be three points (34 degrees) on the Yu Da's starboard side, at a distance of two nautical miles. At 12:10, the submarine began to move forward. At 12:11:45, the Yu Da engaged full astern. The captain was on the bridge. At 12:12, the two vessels collided. The weather at the time was fair but unclear, with visibility of approximately four nautical miles. Yu Da shipowner, signature.</p>
<p>(2) Letter from the Submarine Captain to the Yu Da Captain: The submarine surfaced and remained stationary at 11:45 AM, with its bow pointing southwest. At 12:04, the Yu Da vessel was sighted on the submarine's port side, at a distance of approximately 1,500 yards, heading approximately northwest, three points to the right of the submarine. The submarine began moving forward and turned to port at 12:05, sounding one blast on the whistle. Before the Yu Da vessel turned to starboard, the distance between the two vessels was approximately 1,200 yards. At 12:09, the Yu Da was seen turning to starboard. I sounded two more blasts on the whistle. The submarine's course was 10 degrees south of east. The collision occurred at 12:12. The submarine's bow was heading due east, and the Yu Da's bow was heading approximately due north. The two vessels collided at right angles. The weather was cloudy and calm, with visibility of six nautical miles. Submarine Captain, signature.</p>
<h3>Shanghai News Regarding the Situation in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>▲ Red Bandits Have Withdrawn from Yanping</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, a crew member of the Jing'an warship, recently arrived in Shanghai from Fujian, reported that the situation in Fujian Province a week ago was indeed very urgent. Residents in the provincial capital felt uneasy. Initially, the Red bandit Peng Dehuai's troops did indeed capture various counties in western Fujian. Yanping, upstream of Youxi, was also occupied once, and the situation was very tense. However, after occupying Yanping for just over a day, the bandits withdrew on their own. Although they are still active in the border area of Shaowu and Guanghua, their trend seems to indicate that they will no longer advance rapidly into central Fujian. This may be due to the pressure from the bandit suppression troops in Jiangxi and Hunan, as they want to shorten their defensive lines, fearing the danger of deep incursions, so they retreated on their own. This is also unknown. Now, the area west of the city is defended by Liu Heding's troops, and the provincial capital is very peaceful, etc. The warship is currently docked at Gaochangmiao Port, preparing to load 900 tons of coal, and is scheduled to sail to Beijing within a day or two.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhen Supports the Central Government via Telegram</h3>
<p>▲ Reply to his Representative, Wu Yanong</p>
<p>Wu Yanong, the representative of the 49th Division of Fujian stationed in Beijing, recently came to Shanghai on official business and saw in a certain tabloid that Division Commander Zhang Gan had sent a representative, Xiao, to Guangdong to spread rumors. In addition to informing him of official matters via telegram, he also mentioned this matter. It is now known that he has received a telegram refuting the rumors. The contents are recorded as follows (above omitted): The telegram has been deleted. Regarding the matter, Xiao Jun has not left this place for two months. The report in a certain newspaper is purely fabricated and not worth the laughter of knowledgeable people. Is this what is called news policy? All followers of the Prime Minister are worried and indignant about this meaningless war. Your brother believes that at this time, our party must take the path of peaceful unification and work together on national development. Otherwise, we will not be able to save ourselves from danger and will not be able to face the Prime Minister and be accepted by the people of the whole country. The Chairman's telegram after the telegraph was more effective than one hundred thousand troops against the Guangdong situation. Since I returned from Beijing to defend, the officers and soldiers of this division have understood that the most important responsibility of our party is to suppress the bandits and communists on the one hand, and strive for national development on the other. Therefore, although the Guangdong side has repeatedly used irrational flying bullets to shoot at civilians to show intimidation, the military and civilians have remained calm and have only used righteous and stern words from this headquarters and civil organizations to question the Guangdong side, and have continued to devote themselves to the work of suppressing the Red bandits and the construction of the Songyu Commercial Port and Zhanglong Road. If there are any strange rumors in Shanghai, they can be denied. The recent situation in western Fujian is quite good, and the Rehabilitation Committee has also been established. Zhang Zhen Xiao,</p>
<h3>Talk by Vice Minister of Finance Zhang Shouyong</h3>
<p>▲ The Implementation Date of the New Salt Law is Not Yet Determined</p>
<p>▲ The Shanxi Financial Public Bonds Will Be Issued as Planned</p>
<p>The Vice Minister of Finance, Zhang Shouyong, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Beijing. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed him yesterday at the Finance Department office of the Central Bank, asking about the implementation of the new salt law and the public bonds of Shandong and Shanxi provinces. According to Zhang, the merchant-led system is no longer suitable and there is no point in considering it again. The advantages of the new salt law are that it can increase national tax revenue and improve the quality of edible salt. However, before its implementation, various steps and procedures must be carefully considered to ensure convenient implementation. Therefore, there is currently no definite date for when it can be implemented. As for the rumors that merchants are opposed to it, they are not accurate. Regarding the Shanxi province's issuance of 14 million financial public bonds, it has been decided to proceed as originally planned, and there is no problem. Shanxi province's finances are exhausted to the extreme, and if measures are not taken to subsidize it urgently, it will be difficult to maintain. As for the Shandong silk merchants' recent request to issue 2 million yuan in silk industry relief public bonds, it is currently under consideration and has not yet been fully decided, etc.</p>

<h3>Italian Embassy to Move to Shanghai at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>▲ Location to be Decided Upon Arrival of Chargé d'Affaires Ciano in Shanghai</p>
<p>Regarding the move of the Italian Embassy in Peiping to the south, the Italian government appointed Count Ciano, the Consul General in Shanghai, as Chargé d'Affaires in China. He went to Peiping on the 15th of this month with Embassy Counselor Ross to handle the handover procedures. Yesterday, the Italian Consulate received a telegram from the Chargé d'Affaires stating that he had arrived in Peiping and would be able to complete the handover and move to Shanghai to set up an office around the end of this month. As for the location of the office, according to the secretary of the Italian Consulate, it has not yet been decided whether it will be located within the Consulate General or whether a suitable location will be selected to open a separate office. It will probably be decided after Ciano returns to Shanghai. The buildings of the embassy in Dongjiaomin Lane, Peiping, are to be temporarily retained, but the guard there will be cancelled. The current Italian Minister, Varè, is scheduled to be transferred to another post and may come with the Chargé d'Affaires at the end of the month to prepare to return to his country, etc.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Social Bureau Establishes a Station to Purchase Rice Stem Borer Eggs and Moths</h3>
<p>Rice stem borers are a pest to rice, as everyone knows. The Municipal Social Bureau has spared no effort over the years in preventing and eliminating rice stem borers, dispatching personnel to various districts to provide practical guidance, organizing cooperative stem borer removal experiments, and establishing a station to purchase stem borer eggs and moths, all of which have been quite effective in promoting awareness. Rice fields in various districts have now been planted with seedlings several inches long. All the stem borers are hatching one after another, sucking up nutrients and harming the rice crop. If precautions are not taken and problems are nipped in the bud, the future transformations will be unbearable. In view of this, the Bureau, in addition to repeatedly ordering the municipal committee members of each district to assist farmers within their boundaries in working hard to eliminate the pests and earnestly prevent them, has also formulated strict measures to dig up rice roots and recently formulated methods for searching and catching stem borers, which have been successively announced to farmers in the urban area for compliance and implementation. However, the villagers are poorly educated and have weak financial resources. It is heard that the Bureau, in order to awaken the farmers' efforts to search and catch the pests, in order to enrich people's food, is still setting up a station to purchase stem borer eggs and moths according to last year's method. The price is temporarily set at one copper coin for every two stem borer eggs and moths. The Bureau's purchasing methods are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Methods for Purchasing Rice Stem Borer Eggs and Moths: 1. The Bureau will establish a station to purchase rice stem borer eggs and moths in areas of the city where stem borer damage is more severe, in order to achieve the purpose of preventing and eliminating stem borers and enriching people's food. 2. The Bureau's purchasing stations will be temporarily established in six locations: Yinhang, Wusong, Tangqiao, Gaoxing, Caojing, and the Municipal Agricultural Experiment Station. 3. Each purchasing station will be headed by one director, concurrently held by the municipal committee members of each district and the director of the agricultural experiment station, who will be responsible for all matters of the station. Purchasing staff will be concurrently held by the staff of the district municipal committee office and the experiment station. 4. The Bureau will, at its discretion, provide subsidies based on the work ethic and the number of acquisitions of each purchasing station. 5. Each purchasing station should report any special circumstances to the Bureau for approval at any time. 6. Purchasing stations are under the guidance and supervision of the Bureau. 7. The purchased stem borer eggs and moths, together with the weekly report form, should be submitted to the Bureau for verification and cancellation before 2:00 PM every Monday. 8. When farmers sell stem borer eggs and moths, they should first tie ten egg masses into a bundle and seal ten moths in a bag to facilitate easy counting. 9. The purchasing price will be set by the Bureau and announced to each purchasing station at any time. 10. The purchasing time is set from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM daily. 11. The purchasing period is set to end at the end of August, and may be extended at the discretion of the Bureau if necessary. 12. These measures will be implemented from the date of publication.</p>
<h3>Qin Runqing Discusses the Money Shop Law</h3>
<p>▲ Still Hoping the Government Will Enact Separate Regulations</p>
<p>Regarding the request of the money industry to enact separate money shop laws, the Legislative Yuan decided that there was no need to enact separate special legislation and that it could be supplemented in the Banking Law Enforcement Regulations in the future. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed Qin Runqing, a leader in the money industry, about this matter and asked for his opinion. According to him, banks and money shops are essentially very different in nature. Banks mainly provide loans with collateral, while money shops mainly provide loans based on credit. Although banks also provide credit loans and money shops also provide mortgage loans, these are in the minority. Banks are all limited liability organizations, while money shops bear unlimited liability. Furthermore, the minimum capital of banks is set at 500,000, while the largest capital of the more than 70 exchange money shops in this city is only 400,000 to 500,000, and most are around 100,000, while the annual business is more than 700,000 to 800,000. Therefore, shareholders must make advances at any time and cannot predetermine the amount. In the money shops of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the capital is mostly 5,000 or 10,000, while the annual business is also hundreds of thousands. Banks have a history of at most 40 to 50 years, while money shops have a history of 300 to 400 years. Mr. Ma Yinchu is a banker and is inevitably out of touch with money shops. His opinions may be based on one-sided observations. I still hope that the government will enact separate money shop laws. Now, after the members of the Money Industry Association arrive in Shanghai, a meeting will be held to discuss the matter in detail and present the reasons, so that a request can be made to the Legislative Yuan to enact separate regulations.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Mediated the Pier Donation Issue Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Both the Guest Merchants and the Cotton Cloth Industry Insisted</p>
<p>▲ The Meeting Ended Yesterday Without Results</p>
<p>The cotton cloth industry and the forwarding and customs declaration industry had a dispute over the pier donation issue, which had not been resolved for a long time. Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened both parties and the guest merchants for the second mediation. The attendees included Chen Songyuan, Ke Ganchen, and Shi Jiumao representing the cotton cloth industry; Shi Zikun and Zhu Xiechen representing the customs declaration industry; Yang Junxin representing the Sichuanese guest merchants; Wang Bohua representing the Shandong guest merchants; Gan Zhizhang representing the Shandong guest merchants; and Ji Chunyi, Wang Xinpu, and Sun Jiechen representing the guest merchants from Andong, Yantai, and Harbin, a total of eleven people. Lu Qinghua, director of the Commercial Affairs Section, chaired the meeting, reported the purpose of convening the mediation, and read out the letters from the cotton cloth industry and the guest merchants, and then asked all parties to express their opinions so that a decision could be discussed. First, Chen Songyuan, a representative of the cotton cloth industry, reported, roughly saying that the transaction between our industry and the guest merchants has always been delivered in the factory in this port. After the goods leave the factory, their ownership already belongs to the guest merchants, so the responsibility for paying the pier donation cannot be borne by our industry. This can be proved by the car fare problem resolved by the Social Bureau's mediation last time. Because the ownership of the goods has been transferred to the guest merchants, the car fare from the factory to the pier must be borne by the guest merchants. The pier donation for goods that have left the factory and reached the pier cannot be included in the scope of the cotton cloth industry. Next, Sun Jiechen, a representative of the guest merchants, reported that the guest merchants in Shanghai distinguish goods into large packages and small packages. The pier donation and car fare have always been included in the large packages. If they are proposed to be calculated separately now, it is inconsistent with the usual practice, and the guest merchants cannot recognize it. Next, Shi Zikun, a representative of the forwarding and customs declaration industry, reported that the pier donation has always been included in the price of goods and cannot be included in the freight price. If it is proposed to be calculated separately now, the guest merchants will have no way to report the accounts, which is also true. It is better to include it in the price of goods for convenience. The chairman's opinion is that the mediation must not violate the principles of the Social Bureau's resolved decision, and the responsibility must be determined, and the facts must be compromised to seek convenience in handling. According to the previous decision of the Social Bureau's mediation of car fare and the transfer of ownership of goods, the responsibility for paying the pier donation naturally belongs to the guest merchants. However, due to the lack of manpower to handle business, the guest merchants may entrust the cotton cloth industry to handle the procedures for paying the donation. After the donation is paid, the guest merchants will return all the agency payment to the cotton cloth industry. In this way, there is no conflict in facts and theory. As for the calculation of including the pier donation in the price of goods, it violates the method of the car fare problem mediated by the Social Bureau last time and should not be adopted. Therefore, two methods were drafted: (1) The procedures for paying the pier donation may be entrusted to the cotton cloth industry by the guest merchants. (2) The responsibility for paying the donation belongs to the guest merchants, who must be responsible for returning the full amount and shall not be short. After these two points were raised, the cotton cloth industry, in view of the previous lesson of the car fare problem, although it had been resolved by mediation, the guest merchants had still not fulfilled the agreement. Therefore, the issue of guaranteeing the return of the代繳donation was immediately raised. At the same time, the guest merchants still adhered to the established view of large and small packages. Therefore, the opinions of both parties could not be approached, and the meeting ended without results.</p>
<h3>The Social Bureau Orders the Money Industry to Close for the Old Duanwu Festival</h3>
<p>▲ Other Industries Are Not Allowed to Follow Suit</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau issued instructions to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the central government had stipulated the settlement of accounts in January, May, September, and the end of March, and ordered compliance. Now, according to reports, the Money Industry Association advertised that it would close for one day on the 20th in accordance with the bank holidays. It is necessary to investigate what kind of nature the holiday is. If it is a holiday in accordance with the lunar Duanwu Festival, it is clearly a violation of laws and regulations and a destruction of the historical government. The account period set by the Central Government this time adopted the opinions of the money industry, and it is even more inappropriate to violate it. In addition to sending another letter to the newspapers to stop publishing the advertisement, it is necessary to order the Chamber of Commerce to instruct the association to correct it, and to instruct other industries not to follow suit. This order,</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is Preparing to Hold a General Meeting of Members</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to hold the general meeting of members this year on the 27th of this month, and is preparing everything these days, and the procedures are very busy. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Notice from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce The Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified various associations and store members to urge them to report the letters of attendance representatives, saying that the second general meeting of members of the Chamber of Commerce has been resolved by the Executive Committee and will be convened at 1:00 pm on June 27. All three items that should be reported before the meeting, attendance representatives, payment of membership fees, and submission of proposals, have been notified by letter and newspaper advertisement, and are limited to being sent to the meeting by June 20. Now that the meeting is approaching, all members who have not reported their representatives and have not paid their membership fees must send them to the meeting within two days of receiving the letter. Please do not delay any longer. If there are any proposals, please send them in writing three days before the meeting so that the agenda can be arranged. We will send another special letter to urge you to do so.</p>
<p>▲ Approval from the Social Bureau The Social Bureau reported to the Chamber of Commerce that it was scheduled to hold a general meeting of members, requesting to send personnel to guide and temporarily suspend joining the association in accordance with the articles of association. The approval was opened, and it was learned that the letter had been sent and that Song Zhongqing, a clerk of the Bureau, had been sent to guide at the time. You should know this, this approval.</p>
<p>▲ Organization Review Committee The Chamber of Commerce proposed to discuss the organization of the two review committees of the current general meeting of members at the 49th Standing Committee meeting yesterday. It was resolved that Ye Huijun, Chen Songyuan, Zhu Wenqi, Lu Qisheng, and Zheng Chengqing be appointed as members of the Membership Representative Qualification Review Committee, and Fang Jiaobo, Luo Qinghua, and Yan Ersheng be appointed as members of the Proposal Review Committee. The two committees were established today and began to review.</p>
<h3>Jiao Ri and Jing Xing Measure Shentan</h3>
<p>After being ordered to participate in dredging the Shentan outside the Wusong Estuary, the Hydrographic Survey Bureau immediately carried out various tasks. Yesterday, the Jiao Ri and Jing Xing ships were specially dispatched to conduct on-site surveys and draw detailed waterway maps to rely on the planning and dredging.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Notice on Regulations for Berthing Fees for All Vessels</h3>
<p>▲ Type A: 25 taels per day</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs, Shanghai Port Berths, has rented berths to Chinese and foreign shipping companies for mooring ships. The berthing fees set must be calculated for at least three days. Luo Fude, the Customs Commissioner of Jianghai Customs, specially issued a notice yesterday, saying that the previous lease price for shipping companies in this port to rent this Customs berth in Shanghai Port for mooring ships must be calculated for at least three days. From July 1 this year, it should be changed to one day. There is no change to the berthing fees charged per day. The various berthing fees are listed as follows: Type A berth: 25 taels of regular silver per day or less than one day; Type B berth: 17 taels of regular silver per day or less than one day; Type C berth: 21 taels of regular silver per day or less than one day.</p>
<h3>The Vast Majority of Sailors and Seamen Have Been Dismissed</h3>
<p>It has been two months since the China Merchants Bureau's Guangda ship stopped running. It was initially planned to sell it, but because the ship's employees opposed it, the ship was permanently suspended and planned to be dismantled and converted into a lighter. On the 16th, an order was issued to dismiss all crew members, stokers, and supervisors. The seafarers were each paid two months' salary. After this matter was announced, the employees expressed dissatisfaction, because it was not cost-effective to not repair and operate such an excellent ship, but to rent an outside ship for 96,000 yuan a year to compensate for the household rent. Moreover, stopping and dismantling the ship would cut off the livelihoods of more than a hundred people. Therefore, Jun Anhui, Che Defang, was publicly elected to go to the bureau to petition the director. For the sake of maintaining the lives of all workers, Mr. Che has been negotiating with the bureau for days. As a result, eleven stokers were retained to guard the ship. Yesterday, the Guangda was opened to Gaochangmiao for demolition. All the equipment of the supervisor part was completely abandoned, and the loss was the greatest.</p>
<h3>The National Medical Community Discusses the Reform of Measurement Issues</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau has decided to implement the new system of weights and measures from July 1. The implementation period is not far away. The Shanghai National Medical Association believes that the dosage of medicine is by no means comparable to general food products. If there are inconsistencies at the beginning of the promotion, whether it is too light or too heavy, it will have a huge impact on the patient's family. Without unified innovation, it is particularly difficult to use the dosage of traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions. Therefore, at 8:00 pm the night before, a joint meeting of the Shanghai National Medical and Pharmaceutical Circles was convened at the association's office to discuss the implementation methods. Representatives of the National Medical Association, Jiang Wenfang and Zhu Hegao, representatives of the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association, Zhang Meian and Zhuang Meitang, and others all believed that it is imperative to unify weights and measures in this city, and the pharmaceutical industry cannot be unique. However, if the initial reform is not unified and replaced, it will be particularly detrimental to the dosage of the medical community and the lives of patients. It was decided that the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association would first convene colleagues to determine the implementation date, and then notify the National Medical Association to inform all members to follow and change in order to unify and avoid delays.</p>
<h3>The Candle Industry Complies with the Order to Use New Instruments</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Candle Industry Association complied with the order to use new measuring instruments and notified all members yesterday, saying that the Social Bureau ordered that the new system of weights and measures be promoted in this city, and July 1 was set as the unified deadline. All old instruments will be invalidated by the end of June. The association decided to notify all members to comply with the order to promote it at the members' meeting on the 17th. Be sure to implement it within the time limit. The new instruments to be used are limited to being purchased from the Xiejiao Weights and Measures Inspection Office before July 1, or purchased from a scale shop. If they are found and punished after the deadline, they will be responsible for their own actions. The association cannot help it, and the fines are huge, so be sure to pay attention and do not neglect it.</p>
<h3>Price Survey After the Implementation of the Market Catty</h3>
<p>▲ Estimated Price Increase of One-Tenth</p>
<p>The new system of weights and measures in this city, the Social Bureau has received instructions from the Ministry of Industry, approving its advance implementation on July 1st, announcing the unified use. However, the scales in small vegetable markets will be subject to inspection starting June 1st, with personnel dispatched to ban the use of old scales and replace them with new ones. Previously, the scales in small vegetable markets were inconsistent, with 18 taels accounting for 60%, 20 taels accounting for 20%, and 22 or 24 taels accounting for 10%. Now, one market catty is equivalent to only 13 taels and 6 mace and 4 fen of the old scales. A reporter from Xin Sheng She believes that since the market catty is smaller than the previously used scales, there should be changes in prices. Yesterday, he went to various vendors in Tangjiawan, Ximen, to investigate. Before, one yuan could buy 2 catties of rooster, now one yuan can buy 2 catties and 2 taels. Before, one yuan could buy 1 catty and 10 taels of hen, now it's 2 catties. Before, one yuan could buy 2 catties and 12 taels of fresh meat, now it's still 2 catties and 12 taels. Before, beef cost 800 cash per catty, now it's 700 cash. Before, Japanese fish cost 520 cash per catty, now it's 480 cash. Before, cuttlefish cost 400 cash per catty, now it's 280 cash. Before, taro cost 140 cash per catty, now it's 120 cash. Before, salted vegetables cost 120 cash per catty, now it's 100 cash. Before, white radish cost 120 cash per catty, now it's 100 cash. Before, bean sprouts cost 140 cash per catty, now it's 120 cash. The price difference between before and after implementation is about 85%, but on average, prices have risen by about one-tenth.</p>
<h3>General Industrial Federation Held a Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The General Industrial Federation of China held a general membership meeting at 4 PM yesterday. More than ten people including Wang Yaochen, Qian Chengxu, Zhang Zemin, and Cai Shengbai attended. Qian Chengxu chaired the meeting and first reported on various items: (1) dredging the Kailuan coal transport; (2) dispatching representatives to the League of Nations; (3) the Ministry of Industry appointing representatives to the Industrial Standards Committee; (4) opinions on strict laws for industrial groups in North China; (5) a summary of special fee income and expenditure. Next, proposed motions were discussed: (1) requesting the government to postpone the implementation of the Factory Law, which was decided to be left for the next session; (2) constructing a clubhouse and club, which was decided to be actively prepared, with a construction cost of 150,000 yuan; (3) establishing an Industrial Regulations Research Institute, which was decided to be reserved.</p>
<h3>Social and Public Security Bureaus Ordered the Closure of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce Today</h3>
<p>The Social Bureau issued an order to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "In order to comply with the instructions, according to the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee Secretariat of the Chinese Kuomintang's letter No. 8621 of the Municipal Government's instructions, the Party Department of the Eighth District reported that the Wusong Chamber of Commerce still uses the name 'Baoshan County Wusong Chamber of Commerce' in its external communications, which does not comply with laws and regulations, and requested correction. We are ordered to investigate and report for consideration. Upon investigation, the case of the former Wusong Chamber of Commerce being reorganized into a branch office was previously approved by the Ministry of Industry in consultation with the Municipal Government, and we have already notified and ordered the former Wusong Chamber of Commerce to comply. However, the former Chamber of Commerce has not complied and still uses the old name, which is a deliberate violation of laws and regulations and should be strictly corrected. In addition to dispatching personnel from this bureau to jointly remove the sign and seize the seal, documents, etc., together with personnel from the Public Security Bureau, we hereby order the chamber to promptly select two cadres to come to the bureau before 8 AM on the 20th of this month to handle the matter." It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has appointed Xue Guangqian, the director of the Commercial Affairs Section and a former Qing Dynasty official, to take over this morning.</p>

<h3>The Guanghua Factory Labor Strike Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>▲Various Labor Unions Actively Providing Assistance</p>
<p>The labor strike caused by Gu Yongquan, the manager of the Guanghua Factory, remains unresolved. Over a hundred labor unions in the city, including the Postal Workers' Union, the Publishing Workers' Union, the various district water and electricity workers' unions, and the various district cigarette workers' unions, considering that the prolonged dispute is detrimental to both labor and management, held a meeting at the Postal Workers' Union yesterday, chaired by Li Yongxiang, to discuss concrete assistance measures. The resolutions passed were as follows: (1) Gu Yongquan's oppression of workers means that our unions should continue to demand that party and government agencies expel him from the party and suspend him from his duties in the Guanghua Factory in order to maintain the labor movement and protect industry. This resolution was passed. (2) The job security of workers and labor union leaders at the Guanghua Factory should be thoroughly guaranteed. This resolution was passed. (3) How should our unions actively assist in the Guanghua Factory labor strike, which remains unresolved? It was decided to: (A) issue a declaration and principles stating the attitude and reasons of our unions regarding this case; (B) appoint Lu Jingshi, Hou Dachun, Li Yongxiang, Tang Junsheng, Zhu Xuefan, Zhao Zhenhui, Wang Yongliang, Wang Wenhua, Mei Guozhen, Gu Ruofeng, Zhou Xuexiang, Chen Peide, Lu Muqin, and Weng Ruifu, a total of fourteen people, to gather at the Municipal Party Headquarters at 9 AM tomorrow to petition the Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau; (C) a final statement (reserved); (4) If the petition results tomorrow do not achieve the desired goals, a general meeting of representatives from all labor unions in the city should be convened.

We have now received instructions to send personnel to the office for retesting on the morning of the 26th of this month. This is to notify each police officer to attend the retesting on the 26th of this month without delay. This is the order of Deng Hao, the police chief of the two railways.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau Completes the Unification of City Power Plants</h3>
<p>▲First Step of the Plan</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau established the plan to unify the city's power plants, it has been proceeding step by step according to the established procedures. The first step is to require all small power plants that need to expand their equipment in the future to change their approach and connect their power lines to the nearest large power plant, purchasing and reselling electricity from them. This first step of the plan was completely finished by May 1931. The progress is briefly described below:</p>
<p>The Zhenru Electric Company was the smallest electric company in the city, with a total capacity of only 46 KVA. Jinan University was its largest customer. In the summer of 1928, the university expanded its campus, and the number of lights increased sharply. The company's original equipment was insufficient to supply the demand. It originally planned to add machinery and expand its capacity, but after the bureau calculated it, it was not cost-effective, so it ordered it to negotiate with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to purchase electricity and instructed it on the engineering plan. After several contacts, the two parties agreed and signed a power supply contract on August 15, 1928. The power supply method was for the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to install a 100 KVA open-air transformer at Dujiazhai, the border between Zhenru and Zhabei, to reduce the 6,600-volt voltage to 3,000 volts and then send it to Zhenru Town and the Zhenru Electric Plant in Yangjiaqiao. It also stipulated that the power supply capacity of Zhabei should be temporarily limited to 50 kilowatts. Zhenru paid Zhabei electricity bills at a minimum of 2,500 degrees per month, at a rate of 7 fen per degree. It began to supply electricity on October 1, 1928, which was the first step of the bureau's unification of the city's power plants. Subsequently, the two companies renewed the contract on December 31, 1929, changing the power supply capacity to a maximum of 70 kilowatts, with a minimum monthly power consumption of 4,000 degrees, at a rate of 8.3 cents per degree. At the beginning of the Zhenru Electric Company's purchase of electricity from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, the transformer was installed at Dujiazhai, the border between Zhenru and Zhabei, as a place for electricity to be sent from Zhabei, which was originally for the convenience of the actual situation at the time, but the place was far from the company's power supply center, and the line loss was quite large. If it was damaged, repairs were also inconvenient. The bureau had long instructed the company to plan to move it. In the autumn of 1930, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company supplied power to the International Communications Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications in front of the Jinwang Temple in Zhenru. The line started from the Ziyangqiao main substation in Zhabei, went northwest through the south of Pengpu Town, and then west to the Zhenru area, along Xincun Road, to near the Zhenru Electric Company, and then turned northwest along Taopu West Road to the radio station in front of the Jinwang Temple. This line can be greatly utilized, so it was decided to build another transformer station on the east side of the Jinan University junior high school dormitory. Jinan University is the largest customer of the Zhenru Electric Company, and most of the electricity supplied by the company is for the university, so the above location is actually the company's power supply center. Now this project is about to be completed and will soon be able to use this power supply method. After the Zhenru Electric Company implemented the bureau's plan and purchased electricity from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, the next company was the Xianghua Electric Company. The Xianghua Company had four generators with a total capacity of 575 KVA. The population in its business area was dense, and the demand for electricity was increasing day by day. Moreover, with the establishment of factories, the demand for power was even greater. In August 1929, it was found that its maximum load had reached 396 kilowatts, which was almost the same as the total capacity of the entire plant. According to the historical increase ratio, it was estimated that its maximum load would soon be above 500 kilowatts. If it did not quickly plan to expand, it would not be able to cope. At that time, the Zhabei Yongdian Company already had a 6,600-volt high-voltage power line to the Xiangyanqiao bank on the Shajing Port, and the area east of the Shajing Port was the business area of the Xianghua Company, which was very close and convenient for electrification. Therefore, the company was ordered to negotiate with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company on power supply methods. After the two companies negotiated, they signed a power supply contract on November 30, 1929, which was implemented from January 1930. The power supply capacity of Zhabei was temporarily limited to 600 kilowatts. The electricity price was divided into basic and floating parts. The basic part was calculated at 3 taels, 1 mace, 2 fen, and 5 li of silver per kilowatt of maximum power consumption per month, and was adjusted appropriately according to the level of the load factor. The floating part was calculated at 1 fen of silver per degree, and was appropriately increased or decreased according to the amount of heat required for each degree of power generation and the level of coal prices. The power supply method was to extend a 6,600-volt high-voltage power line from the Xiangyanqiao bank into the Xianghua area and distribute it to the Tianbao Road and Wuhua Road substations, reducing it to low voltage to supply users. Now, in view of the fact that this power supply method is not yet perfect, it is being planned to improve it. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Continued Trial of Battery Counterfeiting Case</h3>
<p>▲ Trademark Has No Factual Basis</p>
<p>▲ Manufacturing Method Needs Investigation</p>
<p>Hu Guoguang of the China Storage Battery Factory accused Ding XiongZhao and He Cai, the owners of the Huiming Battery Factory, of counterfeiting the Fifth Thirty Brand battery trademark. The French Concession Court summoned them again yesterday. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff had purchased half a dozen "Da Wu Wei" brand flashlights produced by the defendant's factory from Kangfu Electrical Materials Factory. The trademark packaging paper stated that it was made of starch, which clearly showed that they were counterfeiting the plaintiff's trademark. The defendant's lawyer, Bian Jialu, argued that the plaintiff was instructed to provide evidence of counterfeiting last time. In today's court hearing, the plaintiff did not present any evidence, only claimed that the defendant was counterfeiting the plaintiff's manufacturing method. After investigation, the manufacturing methods of both parties are different, and chemists can be invited to study them. As for the "Da Wu Wei" brand products produced by the defendant's factory, both the material and value comparison are above the "Fifth Thirty Brand." There is no reason to counterfeit its trademark. Judge Zhu Chen issued a ruling that this case needs to be divided into two points: (1) whether the defendant counterfeited the trademark; (2) whether the manufacturing methods are the same. Today, it was found that there is no factual basis for the counterfeiting of the trademark. The manufacturing method will be investigated and verified after the witnesses are summoned.</p>
<h3>Robbers Arrested and Firearms Confiscated</h3>
<p>Yang Aquan, the detective of the Yangshupu Patrol Station, and Pang Ruiqing, the detective, arrested eight people, including Qian Weigui, Wang Zhenji, Qian Weizhong, Dong Yuzhai, Xu Guozhu, Zhang Kejin, and women Zhang Han and Yang Chen, all from Funing, on Baker Road, Huaide Road, and Qiwupu Road at 9 PM the night before. They also found a pistol, a bullet, and a magazine on the roof of the thatched house where Zhang Kejin lived. They were taken back to the patrol station. It was found that these people had robbed a pawnshop together. They were sent to the Special District Local Court yesterday morning, and Judge Feng conducted a preliminary hearing and ordered them to be detained for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Became a Prostitute After Divorce</h3>
<p>▲ Patron Sent Letter to the Patrol Station to Rescue Her</p>
<p>▲ Result: Sent to the Jiliang Institute for Care</p>
<p>Xu Aidi, a young woman of 29 years old, married Yao Heshang two years ago and went to Qimen, Suzhou together. Later, they suddenly turned against each other. Aidi, unable to bear the abuse, came to Shanghai alone in January of this year and stayed at the home of her stepfather, Wang Genbao (also known as Wang Agen), at 569 Weishui Lane, Ningbo Road. Wang asked about the details and sent a letter to Yao, and then hired a lawyer to handle the divorce procedures for Aidi. As a result, Aidi paid Yao 270 yuan in compensation for losses and signed an agreement. Aidi had no such funds, so Genbao paid it in advance. Afterwards, Genbin told Aidi that the total cost was more than 600 yuan. Aidi knew that it would be difficult to repay, because her stepfather and stepmother, Shen, ran a brothel. She was influenced by what she saw and heard. Even if her stepfather and stepmother did not encourage her, it was difficult to guarantee that she would not be contaminated. Moreover, she was nagged every day and owed them money, so Aidi soon joined them and became a prostitute. Because of her good appearance, many people favored her. There was almost no empty night. However, since she associated with too many people, she contracted syphilis. Because she was afraid of seeing a doctor, it was recently exposed. A patron wanted to help her but could not, so he sent a letter to the Laozha Patrol Station, saying that the prostitute Yueyun (the name Aidi gave herself after becoming a prostitute) was being abused by the pimp and requested a quick rescue. He also wrote down the address. The patrol chief sent detective Yan to investigate the address. He saw that in addition to Aidi, there was also a young prostitute Shen Anan, who was about the age of the moon. She was also from Suzhou. She had been deflowered by someone ten days ago. The detective arrested Wang Agen and his wife and the second landlord Qian Shouqing, along with the two prostitutes, and took them back to the patrol station. After questioning, he learned that Anan was sent by her parents to the brothel to work as a prostitute, and the money she earned at night was divided equally with the pimp. Yesterday morning, the group of people was sent to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Zhou conducted a preliminary hearing. The patrol station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that Wang Genbao was also sentenced to six months in prison last year for illegally setting up a brothel. Now he still does not repent and returns to his old business. He should be severely punished. Judge Zhou then questioned the defendants and ordered Xu and Shen to be temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. Qian paid bail and was released. Wang and Shen were detained separately for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Suicide Due to Lack of Funds for Marriage</h3>
<p>▲ Sun Yongfu Is Also Pitiful</p>
<p>Sun Yongfu, a native of Shandong, is 30 years old and works as a male servant at the Lin Pinsun's home at 35 Foch Lane, Foch Road, French Concession. He has not yet married. He was engaged to a woman surnamed Xu, also from his hometown, in his hometown. Because Sun was working in Shanghai and had a very small income, he had no money to return to his hometown to get married. He has been wasting time until now. Counting the years, he suddenly received a letter from his family urging him to return home to complete the marriage. Sun thought that he had no savings in his hand, and there was no prospect for the wedding money and the cost of the banquet. Even after the marriage, the living expenses of the two people would be difficult to maintain. If he did not return home, the man and woman would be grown up and should be married. He would inevitably be questioned by the woman's family. He had no face to see the elders in his hometown. There was no fun in life, and he suddenly had the idea of suicide. On the afternoon of the 16th of this month, he secretly went to the Hongkou Grand Hotel on North Sichuan Road, booked room number 30, paid the room fee first, and then went out to buy two yuan of opium paste. He returned to the hotel, closed the door and went to bed, secretly swallowing it. He slept until 12 noon the next day. The hotel tea servant Zhuang Yuebin saw that the guest in room number 30 had not yet gotten up. According to the hotel regulations, after 12 o'clock, he would have to pay the room fee for one more day, so the tea room knocked on the door, intending to ask if he would continue to rent it. Unexpectedly, he knocked for a long time without response. He knew something was wrong, so he tried to open the door and enter the room. He saw Sun lying stiffly in bed, moaning non-stop. He immediately informed the accountant and reported it to the Hongkou Patrol Station. The patrol station ordered detectives to go to the hotel to inquire about Sun's situation. He was immediately taken to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, because he had been poisoned deeply, he died at 6 AM yesterday. The body has already been taken to the Fei Lun Road examination room for examination.</p>
<h3>Zhu ZaisShou Killed Two People</h3>
<p>▲ Ob/Gyn Saw Dead Infant</p>
<p>Zhang JinfFa, a native of Shaoxing in the Zhabei Tanzzi Bay area, had a wife, Zhang Wushi, who was 27 years old. Recently, because of bloating in her abdomen, Zhang called Doctor Zhu ZaisShou for medical treatment. Unexpectedly, Zhu was unskilled and said that the woman had swelling disease, so he used strong medicine to attack it. After the woman took the medicine, she fell unconscious due to abdominal pain. Zhang then sent her to Guangren Hospital. It was found that the woman was not bloated, but pregnant, and that the fetus had died in her womb after being attacked by the strong medicine. Therefore, he tried his best to rescue her, but there was no way to do so, and she died. Zhang did not believe that she was pregnant, so the hospital ordered Zhang to sign after dissecting the woman's abdomen. Then he saw the dead infant inside. Zhang then knew that he had been killed by the quack doctor Zhu, so he reasoned with him, but was beaten and his head was broken. Therefore, he went to the Local Court yesterday to sue him, and an inspector was dispatched to examine the case and report back. The prosecutor ordered a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Xiafei Sanatorium</h3>
<p>The Xiafei Sanatorium, run by Austrian medical doctor Wu Tianmin, has been in operation for three years, specializing in internal medicine, such as tuberculosis and blood loss, all of which have been successful. Now that the original site is not enough, he has found a new site at 1351 Xiafei Road, with excellent location and buildings, water fountains, gauze windows, gardens, pavilions, and all new-style buildings, covering an area of more than three acres. There are three large Western-style buildings, which are used as wards, hidden in lush green trees. The entrance to the main road is a tram station, so the transportation is extremely convenient, and the seclusion is far better than the old site. It is now scheduled to move in on July 1. Mr. Wu will also add ordinary wards at a special low price in order to popularize them.</p>
<h3>Soil Trafficker Found at the North Station</h3>
<p>Li Qingzhen, a native of Luoyang, brought more than 100 kilograms of opium soil from Luoyang in three large leather bags. He took the 12:40 PM express train from Beijing yesterday and arrived at the North Station at 10:40 PM in the evening. He held the luggage ticket and went to the luggage room to pick up the leather bag. He was caught by Fan, the deputy chief inspector of the station. He is now being held by the railway bureau's police department for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Paris Will Start Showing Sound Movies Today</h3>
<p>The Paris Cinema on Xiafei Road has always been known in Shanghai for showing first-class silent blockbusters. Now, due to the scarcity of silent works and the difficulty in purchasing good products, the cinema has invested heavily in installing the latest RCA sound machine in order to comply with social trends. This new machine has clear and accurate sound, which is no different from the original sound. At present, first-class cinemas in the United States are vying to adopt it. Only the Paris Cinema in Shanghai has installed this machine. The cinema is scheduled to start showing sound movies today. It is said that its first contribution is Fox's 1930 super product "New Group Fang Conference." The second phase is "Happy Enemies," the third phase is "Broadway's Gold Mine," and the fourth phase is "Chu Luan Jiao Feng."</p>
<h3>Trade Association News</h3>
<p>▲National Medicine Industry: The National Medicine Industry Association, in order to promote and implement the new metric system, has not only dispatched representatives to liaise with the city's National Medicine Association to discuss implementation methods to facilitate mutual promotion but has also scheduled a meeting for 2:00 PM on Monday, the 23rd of this month, at the association's office on the fifth floor of the Salt Industry Bank on Beijing Road. All drugstore owners and managers in the city are invited to attend to discuss implementation methods, aiming to adopt the new system in accordance with legal requirements. The association has also requested the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to send representatives to the meeting to explain and provide guidance on various issues related to the new metric system.</p>
<p>▲Rickshaw Industry: The Rickshaw Industry Association issued a message urging fellow members to continue to unite, stating that the association has been established for nearly four years. During these four years, it has strived for internal unity and the elimination of long-standing malpractices. However, eliminating malpractices is more difficult than promoting benefits, so all public welfare undertakings that should have been carried out have not been fully realized, which the association deeply regrets. Over the past four years, thanks to the concerted efforts and mutual understanding of fellow members, the following can be reported: (1) Reduced frequency of vehicle inspections: The Public Works Bureau inspected vehicles quarterly, four times a year, which, after repeated requests from the association, was reduced to three times. The inspection notices are also distributed evenly by the association based on time, distance, and the number of vehicles. This provides some convenience for vehicle owners and the Vehicle Affairs Office. (2) Gradual elimination of rickshaw thieves: Rickshaw theft and extortion have harmed rickshaw pullers and affected the business of rickshaw dealers, causing deep resentment among industry members for more than a day or two. Since the association petitioned the Public Security Bureau to send the main culprits to the Caohéjing vagrant work-study center, while rickshaw theft in the Chinese area has not been completely eliminated, it is no longer as blatant and unconcerned as before. (3) The French Concession withdrew its order to increase license fees and restrict licenses: The monthly license fees for vehicles operating in the French Concession were determined by the number of rickshaw pullers. Subsequently, the Municipal Council proposed increasing license fees and restricting licenses, changing the old system. After the association jointly demanded this with rickshaw dealers in the Public Concession, the order was withdrawn. To this day, one vehicle still has one license and is not subject to any restrictions. The above are just a few examples that everyone knows. The future is long, and what rickshaw dealers hope for from the association and what the association wants to strive for on behalf of rickshaw dealers are not limited to these few points. Without the joint efforts of rickshaw dealers, how can we obtain the protection of the government, how can we alleviate the suffering of rickshaw pullers, and how can we break free from the shackles of imperialism? Four years of unity have yielded such barely satisfactory results. If we add the 10,000 vehicles in the Public Concession, which have also joined the association, the future status of the association will be beyond imagination. It all depends on the efforts of the rickshaw industry. Currently, the 1,477 vehicles newly released by the Public Works Bureau have not yet fully joined the association's insurance scheme. The association believes that a sound organization is closely related to the rickshaw industry and humbly presents these considerations for your understanding.</p>
<p>▲Fruit Industry: The Fruit and Native Produce Industry Association has a standing Economic Management Committee consisting of five elected members who manage the association's financial affairs. All deposits and withdrawals in banks and money houses must be stamped by these committee members. The previous committee members, Zhang Zhuxi, Xu Xianchang, and others, have completed their terms. The election of the new Economic Management Committee was held the other day. The election was held at 2:00 PM, and the ballot box results showed that Cai Runsen, Cheng Xueshi, Chen Jianfu, Wang Guosheng, and Dong Chunxue were elected. They took office on the spot. Subsequently, the association sent letters to the banks and money houses it deals with, along with the specimen signatures of the five new committee members. Henceforth, all deposits and withdrawals must be stamped by the committee members to ensure prudence.</p>
<p>▲Silk and Satin Industry: The Silk and Satin Industry Association held its 22nd Executive Committee meeting the other day. More than ten committee members attended, with Lu Zhengbing presiding. After formal greetings, the following resolutions were passed: (1) A letter from member Heng Huiji stated that Jilin Tiantaiheng owed money for goods and had repeatedly failed to respond to催促. It was resolved to forward the letter. (2) Omitted. (3) A letter from the Shantou Silk and Satin Cloth Industry Association requested the promotion of national goods and the cessation of foreign goods, instructing the association to collect and send the trademarks of its members' products to Shantou for customers to choose from. It was resolved to send separate letters to each guild to comply. (4) A letter from the Hankou Silk and Satin Industry Association proposed that the government should follow the example of foreign goods and impose a unified tax on domestically produced silk and satin to facilitate sales. The letter included a draft petition, instructing the association to distribute it to various merchant guilds in the inland areas for unanimous response. It was resolved to comply. (5) A letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated that the municipal government had allocated funds to prepare for the establishment of a manufacturing plant for new metric instruments, instructing the association to list the types and quantities of new instruments needed by a specific date for collection and use. It was resolved to notify all members, based on the report of Committee Member Jiang Linshu, to submit the list to the association by the 25th of this month for collection. Separate arrangements will be made for the various merchant guilds. (6) A letter from the China National Products United Department Store stated that the British police had unjustifiably closed the department store, destroying national goods, and requested unanimous support. It was resolved to provide support. (7) A letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated that the National Tariff Commission planned to hire personnel familiar with the industry's business and tariffs for research. It was resolved to publicly nominate Luo Qinghua, Wang Jiean, and Wu Xingcha. (8) The association's general membership meeting is scheduled to be held annually in mid-June according to the articles of association. As the date is approaching, a date should be determined. It was resolved to hold the meeting at the association's office at 1:00 PM on June 25th.</p>

<h3>Chinese and British Buses Collide</h3>
<p>丨On洋鎗小路丨</p>
<p>▲British Route 4 Bus Overturns</p>
<p>▲Four Men and Women Injured, Some Seriously</p>
<p>A British Public Bus Company Route 4 bus, running from Xujiahui to the airfield, collided with a Shanghai South Route 4 bus at 7:50 AM yesterday on洋鎗路, causing an accident. Four men and women were injured. The details of the accident are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Location of the Accident: Both the Shanghai South Public Bus Company Route 4 bus and the British Public Bus Route 4 bus operate from Xujiahui to the airfield. The two companies have fixed schedules and have never had any conflicts. Unexpectedly, at 7:50 AM yesterday, the Shanghai South Route 4 bus, driven by driver number 15 and with conductor number 24, was returning from Xujiahui to the airfield. When it reached麦根路, the British Route 4 bus was following closely behind at high speed. The bus, number 182 with driver number 182 and conductor number 117, was speeding up to try and get ahead and did not honk its horn. When it reached洋鎗小路, the road was narrow, and the side of the road was rugged and muddy, causing the wheels to get stuck in the mud. The Shanghai South Route 4 bus driver could not avoid it in time, and the two buses collided. With a loud crash, the entire British Route 4 bus overturned.</p>
<p>▲Four Injured: Fortunately, the accident occurred in the early morning, and there were few passengers. There were only four male passengers and one female passenger in the bus, as well as the driver and conductor, making a total of seven people. The driver of the bus, number 182, suffered a broken right foot, and the conductor, number 117, also suffered a serious injury to his right hand. One male passenger suffered a head injury, and one female passenger suffered a chest injury. After the accident, both bus companies used the phone to notify their respective companies to send people to the scene. The four injured people were sent to Shanghai Sanatorium for treatment. Whether their lives are safe is currently uncertain.</p>
<p>▲Company's Statement: Afterwards, a reporter visited Xia Shuxiang, the director of the Shanghai South Public Bus Company's Vehicle Affairs Department. According to him, the company's operations in that area have always been very stable, and both sides have fixed schedules and are not allowed to rush or overtake each other. This time, the company's bus was traveling ahead, and the British bus driver deliberately sped up to get ahead, causing the accident. The blame should be determined impartially by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Qin Wenbin Admits to Stabbing Father Lang</h3>
<p>▲Father Lang Refused to Write a Letter of Introduction</p>
<p>▲Qin Wenbin Acted Out of Extreme Hatred</p>
<p>The case of Qin Wenbin, a former cook at the Dongjiadu Catholic Church, stabbing Father Lang with a sharp knife on the night of the 15th of this month has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that after Qin Wenbin was sent to the Public Security Bureau, he was interrogated by the Third Section. Qin confessed that he was originally a cook at the church, but Father Zhang said he was lazy and fired him. He went to the震旦 University student village and asked Father Lang to write a letter of introduction, but he refused. He hated him so much that he went to the City God Temple to buy a sharp knife and stabbed him four times. The official asked if he killed him. He replied, "Yes." He was asked where he lived. He replied, "I live at my cousin Lu Qiusheng's house in Yangchang Alley, Xiaonanmen." On the night of the 15th, he entered through the garden of the church and stabbed Father Lang, who shouted in a foreign language. He then fled, throwing the knife in the garden. Because it was dark, no one saw him. After leaving, he went through Huozheng Lane to Yangchang Alley. His cousin was not awake, so he washed off the bloodstains. The next day, he took a boat back to his hometown in Nanhui, where he was arrested. After the section recorded his confession, it sent Qin to the District Court with a letter. After a preliminary hearing by the prosecutor, the defendant was ordered to be detained pending an examination of Father Lang's injuries before further proceedings.</p>
<h3>Completion Date for the New Western Prison on Huade Road</h3>
<p>▲Approximately One and a Half Years Later</p>
<p>▲Construction Cost of Two Million Taels</p>
<p>The number of inmates in the Western Prison on Huade Road has reached more than 5,000 in recent years. However, because the construction of the new prison next to the old prison is progressing rapidly, the crowded situation in the prison has been slightly reduced. The new prison building was originally laid in 1928. The estimated construction cost is more than two million taels. Most of it has now been built, but the entire project will not be completed for another year and a half. The site is approximately thirty acres and will have four prison buildings, one factory, one prison building for young prisoners, one prison hospital, one police hospital, one office for administrators, one dormitory for Indian police, and miscellaneous buildings. In the future, when the police hospital is completed, the existing hospital on Bazilu will be moved in. The new hospital can accommodate sixty-eight Indian police officers and one hundred and twenty-eight Chinese police officers. A separate prison hospital will be built, which can accommodate one hundred and forty-two patients. It will be connected to the police hospital by an underground passage. The four prison buildings are each five stories high and can accommodate four hundred and sixty prisoners each. They are constructed entirely of steel and reinforced concrete. The remaining offices and hospitals are each five to eight stories high.</p>

<p>▲A Glimpse of the Display: The Ciyou Health Clinic and Medical Center, set up by the Ciyou Association near the Guanyin Temple on Xiqiujiang Road in Zhabei, was filled with children's new clothes, shoes, hats, and other children's toys and foods, all produced by new-style stores in the city. Health forms, pictures, and slogans lined the walls. Although the building was narrow, the layout was quite good. Citizens who visited in the afternoon came in an endless stream.</p>
<p>▲Hygiene Work: From 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM yesterday, a children's health competition was held. A total of sixty-five children participated. Doctors Dang Wenshou and others examined the entire bodies of the children, and the results will be announced in a table soon. From 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM in the afternoon, three doctors from the Health Bureau administered vaccinations to adults and children in front of the Ciyou Health Clinic and Medical Center, totaling 345 people. The children's bathing was presided over by Ms. Hua Jingzhen and Hua Meijie. There were as many as thirty-seven people who were bathed. ▲Opening Performance: At six o'clock in the evening, representatives from the Municipal Party Committee, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and the Health Bureau arrived one after another. The opening ceremony was then held. Wu Weide of the Ciyou Association reported the significance of holding the children's hygiene campaign. The representative of the Health Bureau spoke about the key points of children's hygiene. Then, the Juvenile Propaganda Team performed a costumed hygiene play, and the students of the Ciyou Education Institute performed a new play. From 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM, hygiene films were shown on-site.</p>
<p>▲Parade Situation: Yesterday was a day of continuous drizzle, but the sky gradually cleared in the evening. A total of five hundred and several dozen children from various schools participated. After six o'clock, they gathered on the grassland opposite the Guanyin Temple on Xiqiujiang Road. The orphanage's band was arranged in the front, and the other school children held red and green lanterns, or square lanterns with slogans, and model lanterns of mosquitoes and flies. The parade set off from Xiqiujiang Road, heading east and circling the planned routes. The lanterns shone brightly, and the entire team meandered like a long snake. After about an hour and a half, they returned to the original place and disbanded.</p>
<h3>Truck Kills a Person</h3>
<p>▲The Blame Lies with the Driver</p>
<p>▲Serious Punishment Ordered</p>
<p>Motorist Jiang Asi drove a truck on Haige Road in the French Concession on the afternoon of the 10th of this month. Due to the driver's negligence, he hit and killed a small cart puller, Zhang Loufu. The corpse was verified by the presiding judge. Yesterday, the police sent Jiang to the French court for questioning. The plaintiff, the corpse's family member Zhang Yangshi, extended律师律师 Beck to represent them, stating, "Our lawyer has found that there have been as many as seventeen cases of car accidents causing death in this concession this year, of which truck accidents account for three-tenths, indicating that most truck drivers deliberately neglect their duties. This case was also caused by the defendant driver's negligence, which has been proven by the police to be true. The deceased was fifty-two years old this year and had a wife and children, a total of five people, all of whom depended on the deceased for their livelihood. Now that he has been killed, the entire family has no means of support. We request compensation of five thousand taels." When questioned, the defendant Jiang Asi admitted that he was negligent and caused the accident and begged for leniency. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Jiang to a fine of fifty yuan to be confiscated and ordered him to compensate the plaintiff's family with two thousand five hundred yuan. The truck was allowed to be temporarily detained. If the payment cannot be made, the truck will be auctioned off after July 10th to cover the amount.</p>
<h3>Unfilial Son Beats His Mother</h3>
<p>▲Spectators Greatly Outraged</p>
<p>▲Then Bowed His Head and Begged for Leniency</p>
<p>Liu Zhengfu from Jiangbei, forty-six years old, operates a flatbread shop at the western end of Songxing Road in Wusong. His son, Liu Dazhen, twenty-six years old, works in a flatbread shop behind the Huafeng Yarn Factory. The other day, after an argument with his wife, he beat his wife. Yesterday, Dazhen went to his father's flatbread shop and asked his mother, Liu Wangshi, forty-five years old, for money to treat his wife's injuries. His mother initially refused, but Dazhen smashed his own head with a stone. Seeing this, his mother gave him one yuan and told him to go home and treat his wife's injuries. Unexpectedly, Dazhen took the money and came back, arguing with his mother and raising the stone mill, throwing it at his mother's head. Fortunately, the spectators blocked it, preventing her from being injured. However, the unfilial son still did not give up, causing the spectators to feel outraged and want to beat him. The unfilial son, knowing that he had offended the public and fearing unfavorable consequences, jumped into the river to avoid it. The watchman of the first station of the seventh district happened to see this and rescued him, taking him to the station to report. After questioning by Zhang Jiguang, the head of the first station of the seventh district, the unfilial son bowed his head and begged for leniency, saying that he was willing to change his ways and would never commit such an act again. Director Zhang observed that Liu Wangshi was not injured and leniently sentenced him to three days of detention as a slight punishment.</p>
<h3>Du Yuwei Walks to Kaifeng</h3>
<p>Du Yuwei, a young man traveling alone on foot, set off from Kunshan in the summer of the eighteenth year, walking along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line into Zhejiang and Fujian, then to Guangdong and Guangxi, around Wuzhou. He then suffered from malaria in Guangdong and had to return to the capital to recuperate. After recovering from his illness, he mustered his courage and followed the Beijing-Shanghai line straight into Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. At that time, due to the rampant communist bandits, he was unable to move forward. He transferred to the Jiaoji Railway, entering Qingzhou from Jiaozhou, reaching Jinan and then Caozhou. Along the way, Party, government, and academic circles warmly welcomed him, presenting him with many silk banners and holding meetings to invite him to give speeches, promoting customs and Party-oriented views. Mr. Du carried a camera with him and took pictures of all the famous scenic spots he passed through, in order to compile a walking special edition of field photographs in the future. Previously, due to climbing mountains and crossing rivers, his feet and thighs were exposed to moisture, resulting in sores. After receiving surgical treatment at Caozhou Hospital, he has now set off for Kaifeng.</p>

<h3>Hatong Passed Away Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Set for Great Funeral on the 21st of This Month</p>
<p>爱俪园 master Hatong passed away at 5:05 PM yesterday at the age of eighty-three (according to the lunar calendar). His illness was asthma, which started in the autumn of last year, but it improved by early spring this year. On March 15th of this year, his old illness recurred and worsened. He was bedridden until the 18th, and he hired doctors客脱 (transliteration) and勃勞姆托克 (transliteration) for treatment, but they were ineffective. He passed away yesterday. It is said that the great funeral is scheduled for 10:30 AM on the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Guild Jealousy Leads to Armed Fight</h3>
<p>▲White Pine Gang and Bone Tile Industry</p>
<p>The bone tile industry in the city has a large number of manufacturing workshops and workers. A few years ago,洋莊 sold well, and the business was booming. Recently, foreigners have also set up factories to manufacture, so the business is not as good as before. Unexpectedly, recently, products made of white pine tiles have appeared, which are no less than bone tiles, and have a great potential to surpass them, causing jealousy from the bone tile gang. Therefore, the two sides have accumulated resentment and have repeatedly clashed. The Yuyuan Garden of the City God Temple is where the industry gathers. The other day, in the evening, both sides gathered dozens of people, armed with weapons, to compete for supremacy, launching a large-scale armed fight in the garden, as if facing a great enemy. The in-charge section of the first station of the first district heard about this and immediately sent the 通班长警 to rush to arrest them. The workers on both sides fled in all directions. The police immediately arrested six members of the White Pine Gang and three members of the Bone Tile Gang. Two of them were injured. The police took them all to the station for interrogation, and sent them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau overnight, to be transferred to the District Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on Fake Golden Mouse Brand Cigarettes</h3>

He was detected by a detective from Huacheng Cigarette Company and immediately handed over to the police, and the counterfeiter Rong Chunlin was arrested, and many pieces of counterfeit cigarettes were seized. They were sent to court for trial on the 18th. Judge Shen of the Sixth Court sentenced Zhuang Yushu to a fine of 300 yuan, Rong Chunlin to a fine of 300 yuan, and the fake cigarettes were confiscated. If they are unable to pay, they will be sentenced to one day of imprisonment for every two yuan.</p>
<p>Special Item</p>
<h3>Second Report of Mr. Tang (Continued 3)</h3>
<p>▲ Summary Translation of the Fourth and Fifth Sections</p>
<p>▲ Chapter Four: The issues discussed herein are the four issues regarding the recovery of concessions mentioned in Chapter One. As stated above, the advocacy for recovery is based half on theory and half on practicality. Now, it is further revealed that those who oppose the concession system based on theory do so partly based on the origins of concessions and partly based on the nature of concessions. The arguments based on the origins of concessions are reviewed as follows: Those who support the demand for recovery sometimes regard the public concession system as established by the powers without the approval of the Chinese government and against the will of the Chinese government. However, I believe that the general public considers this view to be inconsistent with the facts. The Shanghai Municipal Council's handling of concession affairs is based on the Land Regulations, and the Land Regulations are effective because they have been agreed upon and approved by the representatives of the treaty powers and the representatives of the Chinese government. The detailed history of the Land Regulations described in a previous section of this report shows that except for the Land Regulations promulgated in 1869, which were not approved by the Chinese government, all subsequent promulgations of these regulations, or any important amendments thereto, as well as the final application of the current Land Regulations to the extended concession area in 1899, were agreed to by the Chinese government. Moreover, a study of the Land Regulations clearly shows that Chinese sovereignty within the concession was not only not abandoned but was also explicitly confirmed by the Land Regulations: the issuance of land deeds within the concession (Articles 2 and 3), the payment of annual rent to the Chinese government for "land leased by foreigners" (Article 8), and the provision that amendments or additions to the regulations, or any doubtful clauses, "shall be decided by the consul and the Chinese local officials in consultation, and shall be subject to the approval of the foreign minister and the highest Chinese government" (Article 28), are all clear evidence of the confirmation of Chinese sovereignty. However, on the other hand, it is important to note that although the Land Regulations explicitly confirm Chinese sovereignty within the public concession, and although the public concession system contained in the regulations has been agreed to by the Chinese authorities, the establishment of an institution by the powers within Chinese territory to exercise administrative power is, after all, a foreign intervention in the scope of power that a country always reserves for itself. Even if it is said that the representatives of the Chinese government participated in the adoption and promulgation of the Land Regulations in terms of facts, this does not yet provide a complete answer to the arguments based on the origins of the Land Regulations. It is also important to note that the origins and nature of the Land Regulations are at least partly based on the provisions of the treaties, which grant extraterritoriality to foreigners. In one sense, the Land Regulations are a product of the so-called "extraterritoriality," and from the perspective of Chinese critics, they are seen as being as objectionable as the extraterritoriality system. The situation of those who oppose the foreign nature of the public concession system is discussed as follows: Before the first Chinese directors took office in April 1928, the governance of the public concession, in terms of exercising the powers prescribed by the Land Regulations, was entirely in the hands of foreigners. All power was either in the hands of foreign ratepayers who had obtained the right to vote according to the Land Regulations or in the hands of a board of directors composed entirely of foreigners, who were elected by foreign electors. The inclusion of Chinese directors on the board fundamentally changed the nature of the public concession. Although the full effect of this change has not yet been felt or recognized, issues such as the employment of Chinese personnel in senior positions in the Shanghai Municipal Council and the publication of the Shanghai Municipal Council's documents and publications in Chinese have been re-examined in light of the new situation that has been created, and some important changes have been implemented regarding these issues. At the same time, further reform plans are being carefully considered. Regarding the arguments in favor of recovery based on practicality, an opinion was previously expressed and is now quoted here: the public concession system, if examined in terms of its actual results, is superior to any municipal system established in Chinese territory to date. The report also mentions that under the new circumstances, the issue of allocating municipal funds for the special welfare of the Chinese people has been raised, which shows that the current participation of Chinese directors in the council affairs is a more complete recognition of municipal cooperation between Chinese and foreign residents in the public concession. Regarding another aspect of the support for recovery based on practicality, it is discussed as follows: in terms of the unified administration argument, if the entire Shanghai area could be managed by one administrative body, there would be no doubt that it would benefit certain parts of the municipality, most notably the police and sanitation departments. However, the benefits of unification would depend on the nature of the unified administration under which the public concession and other municipal areas would be jointly governed. The report then summarizes and considers the opinions of those who oppose recovery. Now, let us discuss the arguments of those who oppose recovery. These arguments can be summarized as follows: (1) The public concession system established in accordance with the Land Regulations has been approved by the Chinese authorities and is stipulated in the treaties and various measures formulated to implement the treaties. These treaties and measures are still legally valid and effective. (2) Maintaining this system does not involve denying Chinese sovereignty within the public concession. (3) The security provided by the public concession is far superior to that of any area governed by the Chinese. Security has two meanings: (a) defense against foreign aggression and prevention of internal disorder; (b) adequate guarantees for the enjoyment of individual rights, including property rights. This feature of the public concession system is a fundamental requirement for the great commercial, banking, and industrial interests centered in the concession, and is therefore a fundamental requirement for Shanghai's current status as China's leading commercial and economic center. (4) In addition to security, the practical result of the public concession system is good governance, which greatly benefits Chinese and foreign merchants and residents within the concession, both past and present. The main reason for achieving this result is the exercise of the powers authorized by the Land Regulations by the foreign community.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>[H Fourth Sheet</p>
<p>The way in which the power authorized by the Land Regulations is used. (5) The circumstances that originally necessitated the establishment of the public concession system in accordance with the Land Regulations still exist. Under the current circumstances, if the public concession is handed over to Chinese administration, it is feared that the valuable results that the existing system has already achieved will not be maintained. In my opinion, the reasons that opponents of recovery can put forward, and which support the first four of the five points mentioned above, have been revealed by me when discussing the origins of the public concession system, the security it provides, other outstanding features, and the value of the actual results obtained. However, regarding the argument against recovery, if what I have stated is correct, it is important to note that this argument does not involve a demand that the public concession system established in accordance with the Land Regulations should be regarded as an immutable system. Opponents of recovery have indeed urgently stated that, under the current circumstances in China, there are strong practical reasons to oppose abolishing the existing system of the concession and handing it over to Chinese administration. However, if the situation changes and the Chinese government is able, by its own power, to establish a system within the public concession that can achieve the same results as the existing public concession system in terms of security, maintaining law and order, respecting private property rights, and good governance, it is not said that this new system should not be established. Therefore, the argument against recovery does not go so far as to assert that there are no theoretical reasons to support recovery. However, the point they are arguing is that even for the sake of satisfying the wishes of the Chinese people, the recovery of the concession must ultimately be carried out, but under the current circumstances, recovery is almost impossible because it will inevitably be followed by unavoidable unfortunate consequences. The report then suggests that the actual result of recovery depends on how the future government of the public concession will be established after recovery. Therefore, the second question, namely, what kind of new system will replace the old system after recovery, must be discussed. The points to be discussed are as follows: If, in reason, the best possible assumption can be made regarding the future system of the public concession after recovery, can the reasons held by those who oppose recovery as a practical policy for the near future of the public concession still be valid? Or can the immediate recovery of all difficulties be resolved if the Chinese government issues a charter, either solely for the public concession or together with other areas of Shanghai, based on the same principles as those currently in force in the public concession, and allowing the system of local autonomy to continue based on the cooperation of Chinese and foreign residents? The so-called "charter" means "a legal document issued by the National Government, which is effective by virtue of Chinese law, rather than relying on the measures contained in the treaties between China and the powers, and which stipulates that the Chinese community within the public concession will occupy a majority in the sole or multiple governing bodies within the concession." To know the effect of immediately recovering and issuing a charter, three further questions must be considered as follows: (A) Security is an essential element for maintaining Shanghai's status as a commercial center. Does the government established in accordance with the charter have the necessary power to continue to maintain various security conditions? What are the hopes for this government to exercise its power to maintain such security conditions? (B) What are the concrete guarantees for the permanence of this charter and the non-infringement of the autonomy it grants? (C) Is the local autonomy system established in accordance with this charter and controlled by Chinese votes a genuine local autonomy system, allowing the residents of the public concession to effectively exercise their right to independently handle affairs within the concession? To what extent can the outstanding features of the public concession system be maintained by this system? The report notes that the above three questions should not be considered in the abstract, but should be considered in relation to the current situation in China, and it is pointed out that question (A) has two aspects, because it involves two items: (1) What is the theory of the conditions that can be imagined and may be included in the charter? (2) What are the likely practical results of exercising the administrative powers conferred by these conditions? Question (A) is then discussed and answered as follows: (1) In terms of security relying on protection, if the international status of the public concession disappears and the functions of its governing body are based on the charter issued by the Chinese government, then the defense of the public concession will no longer be able to rely on the practical assistance of the powers, such as the assistance and dispatch of troops by the powers in times of crisis in the past. The special advantages previously enjoyed in terms of defense due to its international status will thus disappear. If a reasonable certainty cannot be obtained that the crises commonly seen in the past will not recur in the future, then replacing the existing system in accordance with the Land Regulations with a system established in accordance with the charter, no matter how well-equipped the public concession can be to defend itself under this new situation, the security within the concession will inevitably be reduced, with extremely serious consequences. (2) In terms of security relying on the rule of law, the governing body of the public concession organized in accordance with the charter may be granted a power that allows it not only to maintain the rule of law within the concession, but also to improve it. However, whether it can maintain and improve it depends on whether the right to exercise the power conferred is recognized by habit, and whether the governing body and its officials can abide by existing rule-of-law habits in the ordinary exercise of administrative power, and whether they can effectively implement the powers conferred in the charter. Question (B) is discussed as follows: If the charter of the public concession does not have a reasonable guarantee to ensure its permanence and non-infringement, then this charter is of no value to formulate. Any charter issued can be assumed to be contained in the laws enacted by the legitimate legislative body, or promulgated by the government in accordance with the provisions of these laws, but except for those stipulated in the treaties, nothing can prohibit this charter from being amended by subsequent legislation, or even revoked or amended by administrative action. Because under the current circumstances, there is no concrete constitutional guarantee to prevent the enactment of laws that abolish or amend it, or to cancel the charter by order of an administrative official. Before China's constitutional system is developed, and its courts are not only able to be independent of the administration, but also strong enough to enforce compliance with the law, even against the government itself, the above situation will continue. The same difficulties will also arise regarding the interpretation and application of the charter. The local autonomy charter given to Shanghai or the public concession must be interpreted by the Chinese courts, but before there are satisfactory guarantees of judicial independence, there is no guarantee that the powers given by the charter will not be arbitrarily deprived, or that the judicial decisions will not be influenced by the administrative or military authorities, so that these powers cannot be exercised. Even if Shanghai has its own courts, whose independence is specially guaranteed, these courts are not sufficient if problems arise between the local government and the National Government regarding the exercise of the powers conferred by the charter. Because if a problem arises, it must be decided by the national court. In addition to the lack of independence in the courts that interpret the charter, it is also important to note that the separation of government powers is based on law and can be enforced by the courts according to the division, but this concept is completely unfamiliar to the Chinese. The report then mentions a suggestion that the charter could include a provision to prevent the use of force to invade the area of local government and to restrict the National Government's power to levy taxes and special taxes in the area of local government, but it is pointed out that the courts have no power to protect this provision from being violated. "If there is no power to effectively implement the provisions of the charter, then the guarantees included in the charter are merely empty talk on paper. 'Security' cannot be built on this basis." The conclusion of question (B) is as follows: Therefore, under the current circumstances in China, unless treaty provisions are used to ensure that the affairs of the public concession are still handled by means of international cooperation, there is no effective provision to protect the powers conferred by the charter. Therefore, regarding the effectiveness and power of the charter, if the assumption that it relies on Chinese law, rather than on the measures contained in the treaties between China and the powers, is correct, then the answer to question (B) must be negative. Under the current circumstances in China, if any genuine local system is to be established in the public concession and thus give a security such as that given by the existing system of the public concession, its only appropriate basis is an international agreement.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor: In the "Dongjiadu Catholic Church Bloodshed Case: Assassin Arrested" section of the local news column in your newspaper on the 18th, it stated that the church owns a lot of property and the monthly rental income is handled and managed by Father Lang. It also stated that when parishioners have weddings or funerals, they must pay at least several hundred yuan to hold Mass rituals in the church. After investigation, there are indeed several houses in the Dongjiadu area, which are owned by the General Church of the Nanjing Diocese of the Catholic Church. The rental income is used to supplement the various sub-churches, schools, hospitals, and charitable institutions throughout the Jiangsu Diocese. Dongjiadu is just one of the sub-churches in the diocese, and it has no right to collect rental income, let alone handle and manage it. Furthermore, when church members have weddings or funerals, even if they hold Mass rituals in the church, they are all voluntarily assisted by the parties concerned to supplement charitable expenses, and there is absolutely no need to demand hundreds of yuan. Your newspaper also called Qin Wenbin a cook in the church who was dismissed for poor cooking, which is even more unfounded. According to reports, Qin Wenbin is an ordinary servant in the church, not a cook. The occurrence of this incident was purely due to a villain harboring resentment and intending revenge. On the 4th of this month, the church happened to have a major feast day. The church was directed by Seminarian Zheng Xiu to direct the servants to decorate everything. Qin Wenbin was also among them. Because of his stubborn attitude and refusal to obey orders, Seminarian Zheng Xiu informed the priest and slightly reprimanded him. In the evening of the same day, Qin suddenly came to say goodbye, saying that he had obtained another job and would come to report tomorrow. The priest did not force him to stay because he voluntarily retired. However, he came again the next day to insist that the priest issue a letter of guarantee. The priest did not agree because of his usual improper behavior. Qin left reluctantly. Who would have thought that he would harbor resentment over a small matter, wield a knife, and cause the riot on the 15th? The above is all the factual situation, which is obviously inconsistent with what is reported in your newspaper. This matter concerns the reputation of the church and is for the sake of a true record of the news. I hereby submit this letter and request that you correct it as soon as possible. I deeply hope for this. Sincerely, The Dongjiadu Catholic Church, June 19.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have read the section of your newspaper on June 17 regarding the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau's strict order to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce to dissolve within a time limit. After receiving the instructions from the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, our association submitted a reply stating that there were still undisclosed circumstances to be reported and requested the Ministry of Industry to review the case. We have now received a response from the Ministry stating that there is reason to continue to exist and that we should wait for further instructions to be followed. Therefore, we will have to submit another request to the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to maintain our existence. This is the first point that should be clarified. As for the various misunderstandings in the report in your newspaper about the party department's investigation into the collection of flag fees, they are too numerous to mention. However, what needs to be clearly understood is that the inspection of ships was an opinion put forward by our association for the sake of local security and contributed to the Jiangsu Provincial Department, as evidenced by the written report. Why falsely use the words "request from Zhejiang and Jiangsu shipping merchants?" The provincial government then deliberated on the measures and ordered the Fourth District of the Water Police Team of the Provincial Public Security Bureau to handle it. It can be seen that the inspection duties are entirely carried out by the Fourth District of the Water Police and have nothing to do with Shu Shan personally. How can he extort floating fees from various industries? Anyone with clear eyes can see this at a glance. How can such groundless rumors be aimed at individuals? This is the second point that urgently needs to be clarified. Gu Ningbo's Pig Industry Jinglan Guild sued Shu Shan for allegedly collecting flag fees. If it is not because of ignorance and being completely deceived by others, it is urgent to summarize the facts and ask your newspaper to correct them quickly to conform to the facts. Sincerely, Zheng Shushan, June 17.</p>

<h3>Detailed Record of the Anniversary of the Demise of the Premier in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The 16th of this month is the ninth anniversary of the demise of the Premier in Guangzhou. The Shanghai Special City Party Department specially convened people from all walks of life in the city to hold a memorial meeting in the Party Department auditorium. The next day, due to limited space in various newspapers, only a brief overview of the situation was disclosed. I attended and saw more details, which I will record as follows.</p>
<p>On that day, a bamboo cloth banner reading "Shanghai Commemorates the Ninth Anniversary of the Demise of the Premier in Guangzhou" was hung high at the entrance of the Party Department. The party and national flags were hung on both sides. In the auditorium, there was a huge half-length portrait of the Premier in a Western suit, surrounded by pine and cypress trees, adorned with paper flowers. The walls were covered with slogans such as "Continue the Premier's Spirit of Struggle" and "Continue the Premier's Spirit of Non-Compromise." Yang Qingyuan, the Minister of Propaganda, chaired the meeting and said that the Premier had devoted himself to the cause of national revolution for nearly forty years in order to achieve freedom and equality for China. The hardships and difficulties he went through are too numerous to mention, but the most prolonged and dangerous period was during the war in Guangzhou in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. This left a deep impression and a painful lesson on us. We should always regard it as the most inspiring and encouraging commemoration. At that time, Chen Jiongming controlled the military power of Guangdong and Guangxi, outwardly claiming to support the Premier but secretly opposing the Premier's policies. At that time, the Premier overcame all difficulties and personally led a large army to swear an oath to the Northern Expedition in Guilin. Chen then assassinated Comrade Deng Keng and cut off the military expenses for the Northern Expedition, wanting to put the soldiers on the front line to death. Later, because Zhao Hengti refused to allow passage, the General Headquarters moved to Shaoguan and returned to Guangdong, heading towards Jiangxi. Chen then secretly ordered his henchmen, Ye Ju, to besiege the Presidential Palace, occupy the institutions, and offer a reward of 200,000 yuan to harm the Premier. Someone secretly telegraphed the Premier in advance, asking him to leave the palace and take temporary refuge. Secretary Lin Zhimian also entered the palace that night to report. The Premier believed that even if Chen was evil, he would not resort to such rebellious and abnormal means of a traitor. Soon the rebel army approached, and Lin and others again urged the Premier to leave the palace, still willing to die for the country to thank the people. Seeing the urgency of the situation, Lin and others forcibly dragged him out of the palace and onto the Chu Yu warship. The rebel army attacked repeatedly. The Premier remained calm and composed throughout. Later, because the Northern Expeditionary Army was unsuccessful in suppressing the rebellion, he entrusted the task of pacifying the chaos to the support troops from various places. On August 8, he left Guangdong for Shanghai. The hardships and dangers he suffered during these fifty-odd days are countless. As a result, the rebel army could not harm the Premier's hair, and the Premier's revolutionary spirit and patriotic sincerity were more evident than the sun and the moon, and he was even more respected by the whole country. Today, commemorating the Demise of the Premier, we should associate it with the difficulty of the Premier's creation of the Republic of China. The situation we have today is all exchanged for the sacrifice of countless martyrs' heads and blood. Without consolidating unity, it is not enough to maintain peace. Now, the remaining warlords and idle politicians are gathering in Guangzhou again, and the evil communists are rampant in Jiangxi, all of which are obstacles to the Republic of China. I hope that people from all walks of life will unite to support the provisional constitution of political tutelage, overthrow the new warlords who endanger the party and the country, and consolidate peaceful unity. Everyone applauded. Then, two proposals were passed, and slogans such as "Commemorate the Demise of the Premier in Guangzhou" and "Eliminate All Reactionaries" were shouted before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Cuckoo)</p>
<p>Heartbroken and devastated are originally exaggerated adjectives used by poets and lyricists for those who are heartbroken in love. But people who are in love have at least three kinds of illnesses: insomnia, indigestion, and inexplicable depression.</p>
<h3>Wonderful Sayings Picked Up</h3>
<p>— Cai Liang</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Guangdan spoke of the three words "eugenics." In the minds of our esteemed countrymen, I fear this concept has not yet made an impression. However, Westerners have already applied it from humans to various animals. What mare has mare caretakers, cow has cow maids. Regarding the selection of seeds, there is extremely deep research. Look at the horses in the Shanghai Racecourse, all so magnificent and extraordinary. This is powerful evidence. Other things can also be imagined. If we talk about our poor and weak nation, we will naturally be bullied by others everywhere. Because in their eyes, we are simply not even as good as cattle and horses. Speaking of this, don't you think it's painful? Therefore, as I see it, if a nation wants to survive in the current world, especially a backward country like China, it is even more necessary to vigorously study "eugenics." When the race is truly improved, the country will naturally become strong without needing to be forced.</p>
<h3>Foreign Folk Remedies of a Medical Doctor</h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>Dr. Fei Kunnian, who served as a physician in various public hospitals in Germany and Austria for more than ten years, recently returned home to visit his relatives. I was troubled by poor appetite, so I went to Dr. Fei's residence at No. 9 Parker Road to seek advice. I obtained the Austrian folk remedy of adding tea to meals, and after trying it, it worked like magic. Later, I met Mr. Fei again, and we discussed many Western folk remedies. I now record the essential ones for the benefit of readers.</p>
<p>▲Adding Black Tea to Meals: Whenever we encounter sluggish digestion or poor appetite due to weakness or overwork, the way to remedy it is to drink a cup of strong black tea on an empty stomach every morning. Add a large amount of white sugar to the tea, making it even sweeter and more palatable. It is even acceptable if the ratio of sugar to tea is half and half. After taking it for ten days, one should be able to have a better appetite than usual.</p>
<p>▲Salt Water to Stop Thirst: After exercise or work, we often sweat profusely and feel extremely thirsty. Drinking any liquid only increases abdominal bloating and does not relieve thirst. Thirst is actually a mixed sensation of touch, warmth, pressure, and dryness. The reason is a lack of saliva flow and a deficiency of water and salt in the body. If you drink a cup of salt water, saliva will naturally be produced.</p>
<p>▲Beer to Sober Up: Those who are overly fond of drinking often get drunk. The next day, they still feel dizzy and disoriented. If they drink a little more wine, they will feel refreshed and return to normal. This is commonly called "revival wine." If you drink a glass of cold beer, the effect is even more pronounced. It is also good to use freshly squeezed lemon sugar tea instead of wine.</p>
<p>▲Hiccups and Nasal Congestion: If the throat is occasionally subjected to special stimulation, hiccups will follow. Hold your nose, stop breathing, and drink several mouthfuls of warm tea water at the same time to cure it. In the early stages of a cold, if nasal congestion is unbearable, boil lemon juice, add sugar, and drink a cup while it is hot to clear the nose and feel comfortable. If you feel unwell and your pores are tightening, indicating that illness is about to strike, drink a large glass of cold water with a drop of iodine tincture to prevent it. However, the amount of iodine should be small rather than large. An excess of one drop can harm the body.</p>
<h3>Research on Famine Relief Food (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>The third recipe says: "Seven sheng of black beans and three sheng of sesame seeds. Wash them with water and steam them immediately. Do not soak them for too long. After steaming, dry them in the sun, remove the shells, and steam them again, repeating the steaming and drying three times. Grind them into pills the size of longans. Take one pill per serving. It will prevent hunger for three days." I believe that the nutrients contained in chestnuts and walnuts are more abundant than those in glutinous rice and sesame seeds, and black beans are even more abundant than chestnuts and walnuts. I will list them as follows:</p>
<p>Item Name     Fats          Water          Carbohydrates    Protein        Fat            Starch         Remarks</p>
<p>Chestnuts    174.14       22.8            218.94                      Each catty is equivalent to 4 catties and 11 taels of rice</p>
<p>Walnuts    170.94       355.14       19.14                      Each catty is equivalent to 4 catties and 12 taels of rice</p>
<p>Black Beans    204.   108.  138.   Each catty is equivalent to 5 sheng and 6 he of rice</p>
<p>From the above list, it is clear that the effectiveness of the second recipe is greater than that of the first recipe, and the third recipe is even better. Every year when the year ends in Hangzhou, we must wrap zongzi with glutinous rice. The fillings are divided into several types. Black beans are skinned, stir-fried into a paste, and called "Yuansha," which is the third recipe. The roughly made ones are mixed with black beans and glutinous rice and called "black-eyed pea zongzi." Or the beans are mashed into a paste without removing the skin and called "bean paste," all for the sake of being easily filling. Or chestnuts are mixed with glutinous rice and called "chestnut zongzi," which is the second recipe. Those with jujube paste as filling are the first recipe. Those with glutinous rice flour as the outer layer and filled with sesame seeds and walnuts combine all three recipes. The same principle applies to "Washing Sand Soup" or "Bean Paste Steamed Buns." These are all foods that people often eat, so why should there be any doubts?</p>
<h3>Eulogy for Madam Yu, Mother of Sun Choucheng</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiying</p>
<p>Madam Yu, mother of Mr. Sun Choucheng, a colleague at the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association, passed away on Buddha's Birthday. The eulogy is as follows:</p>
<p>She assisted her husband with diligence and taught her children with righteousness. She possessed both the virtues of a wife and the model of a mother. Her wise son is a rising star, a national asset. Skilled in both military and civil affairs, he displays his talents. She was concerned about the suffering people and extended her kindness widely. The Phoenix chariot returns west, and her beautiful voice will not be forgotten. Gazing at her portrait, her life spirit is still present. How little the difference between her and the styles of Tao and Meng.</p>
<h3>Strange Marriage Customs</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met an old friend, Mr. So-and-so, who is a soldier. During our meeting, he described the marriage customs of women in Tingzhou, Fujian, which were quite interesting. I quickly recorded them to fulfill the purpose of free discussion.</p>
<p>The women of Tingzhou are very open-minded, beautiful, and intelligent. Even during the Qing Dynasty, they had already abandoned the bad habit of foot-binding.</p>
<p>During the three years between the ages of seventeen and nineteen, they choose their spouse. Every time they encounter the Lantern Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and other festivals, they all dress up elaborately and go out to seek a mate. If they find someone they like, they can invite him home and tell their parents. Their parents will treat him like an honored guest, offering him auspicious foods such as lotus seed soup and glutinous rice balls, hoping that the two of them can be united and have many children. On this day, the man will stay at the woman's home.</p>
<p>If the woman believes this man is reliable, she will announce her marriage to him. Even her parents have no right to interfere. On the day of the wedding, all the men who have been invited home by the woman in the past (those who were rejected) should present a folding fan with their name inscribed on the left side, half-opened, and arranged on the ceremony table. The bridegroom's fan will be fully opened and placed in the center. The number of fans represents the woman's eligibility. More is considered an honor, while fewer fans cause discontent.</p>
<p>The houses in Tingzhou are very large, and many have bamboo curtains. When there is nothing to do, women hide behind the curtains to look at the scenery outside. If a man sees them, regardless of whether he knows them or not, he can enter and talk to them.</p>
<p>There is a stream in that area, with peach blossoms planted on both banks. When the flowers are in bloom, the stream water often turns red, hence the name Peach Blossom Stream. It is also a strange sight.</p>
<p>▲Publishing News: The "Wei Bao" has rich content and pure principles. Since its publication, it has been highly praised by readers. It is reported that the third issue will be published today. The material is even more exciting. Newspaper vendors are distributing it. For those in other cities who want to subscribe, please send a letter with postage to 231 Lloyd Road, Shanghai.

<h3>Three Eras (11)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>(5) The Second Enemy</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaosan became a soldier not only because he wanted to make a name for himself, but also because he was angered by his wife, Zhang Ersao. Zhang Ersao always said, "If I can't find an official, can't I find a rickshaw puller?" Zhang Xiaosan thought to himself, "I can't read and I don't have money, how can I become an official?" This was ultimately what led his wife to look down on him. Later, he thought of the storytellers' tale of Xue Rengui, who also came from a poor background. "Why can't I learn from him?" he thought. "If I want to become an official, the only way is to become a soldier." Thinking this, he was persuaded by a recruiting speaker at Tianqiao and immediately joined the army. After joining the army, he realized that becoming an official was not an easy task. He had joined the army to prove himself, but unexpectedly, things were even worse than before. All of this was caused by his runaway wife. He hated her even more. The policeman was Zhang Xiaosan's enemy, and he finally vented his anger by beating him up. His second enemy was his wife. He wanted to find her and give her a beating. But after she ran away, he didn't know where she was hiding. How could he find her? Time passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, a year had passed. One day, Zhang Xiaosan set out with the army. He was in the baggage train, escorting two large carts of luggage. As the carts passed through Tianqiao and out of Yongdingmen, he encountered his second enemy at the Tianqiao head. She was not the same as before. Her hair was combed sleekly, and her face was covered in white powder. She was wearing a floral print cheongsam and swaying as she walked along the road. Behind her was a man in a long gown, walking and smiling with her. Zhang Ersao kept turning her head back, laughing and talking to him. When Zhang Xiaosan saw this, he wanted nothing more than to grab the rifle on his back and shoot them both, first killing Zhang Ersao and then the man with her. However, there were officers in front and behind, and he not only dared not fire his gun but also dared not leave the column. He could only glare at Zhang Ersao. As he glared at her, Zhang Ersao also looked at him, took the man's hand, and whispered something. The two of them then disappeared into the crowd. Zhang Xiaosan was filled with hatred. The man's face looked familiar. He had seen him somewhere before. That's right. He was the messenger from the house of Li, the deputy minister in the same alley. His wife used to wash clothes for him. So it was him who had seduced her and run away. "One day, when I get my hands on him, I'll have him shot," he thought as he followed the column. Before he knew it, he had passed through Yongdingmen. Outside Yongdingmen was the countryside, no longer Beijing. He was over thirty years old, but he never thought that leaving Beijing would be like this. He also thought that this time he was leaving Beijing to fight with Inspector Zhao. Whether he would return or not was uncertain. Thinking this, he couldn't help but turn his head back and take another look at the city walls behind him. He felt a strange reluctance in his heart. In fact, everyone in the city, from the President to the 1.3 million residents, had nothing to do with him. And there were also his enemies and rivals in love.</p>

In the afternoon market, due to strong demand in the market, it suddenly became bullish, and the closing price rose even more sharply. This was because the market sentiment was good, and the supply and demand situation was very different. As a result, the 20% Customs Bonds rose by about 2.5 yuan, the 19% Customs Bonds rose by 1 yuan and 67 jiao, and other bonds also rose by 5-6 jiao to 1 yuan. However, the fluctuations in the 7-year 96 Whole 6 were minimal. The total daily transaction volume for spot goods was only 1,000 yuan, and the transaction volume for futures was more than 19 million yuan.</p>

<h3>The Yarn, Cotton and Cloth Market Is Tight</h3>
<p>▲Yarn Sales Remain Very Smooth</p>
<p>The yarn market is very firm and the rising trend is very strong. In fact, the demand for existing yarn is becoming more and more enthusiastic. The procurement from the north is unusually active. The 16-count and 20-count yarn from our factory have been completely bought out, and there are no existing goods to buy. They have changed to buying futures for July and August, which shows the enthusiasm of the various gangs. This situation is completely affected by the exchange rate. The north has always been occupied by Japanese yarn. Recently, because the price of Shanghai yarn is quite cheap and the sales of cloth in that area have also improved, there has been a large amount of inflow. Therefore, the sellers see that the factories' existing goods have been emptied and the various gangs continue to come to purchase and make up for losses. The situation in the market is very tight. If the current sales continue uninterrupted, the price of yarn may reach a new high. It is also possible that there will be a period of fluctuation in the middle.</p>
<p>▲People's Standard Rises 6-7 Qian: The opening of the People's Standard price in the morning fell with the decline in foreign cotton. People's hearts were slightly tired, and each fell by 6-7 qian. Then, at the second session, the market atmosphere suddenly tightened. Because there was a lack of sellers, the market became very tight. Prices for each month rose by 3, 4, 6, and 8 qian. The market atmosphere remained strong in the afternoon, and the closing was slightly tired, with each rising by 1-3 qian. The transaction volume was 61,700 bales. It was found that Dafu sold 1,450 bales, Gongtai sold 1,450 bales, Tongyu sold 1,550 bales, Gengfeng sold 4,300 bales, Shenchang sold 1,850 bales, Yongfeng sold 2,450 bales, and Yichang sold 1,450 bales. Jifeng bought 1,200 bales, Shenxin bought 1,950 bales, Tianlong bought 2,250 bales, Changfeng bought 2,700 bales, Yiyu bought 1,300 bales, Deki bought 1,100 bales, and Taixing bought 1,200 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Prices      Increase/Decrease  Inventory</p>
<p>June 1657       Up 7       38,400 September 1655         Up 3       61,300</p>
<p>July 1672      Up 6      67,500 October 1657          Up 7        57,050</p>
<p>August 1678        Up 9       92,100 November 16574        Up 4   43,000</p>
<p>▲Customer Sales of 3,000 Bales: Sales of existing yarn are still brisk. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 3,000 bales throughout the day and 2,400 bales of futures. The market situation is very firm. Customers from Tianjin bought 1,200 bales, inland bought 410 bales, Hankou bought 375 bales, Shantou bought 170 bales, Sichuan bought 100 bales, Ningbo bought 200 bales, Guangdong bought 200 bales, Qingdao bought 100 bales, and mixed gangs bought 400 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Follows U.S. Cotton Trend Lower</h3>
<p>The cotton market is generally weak because U.S. cotton prices are declining, causing a slight softening in sentiment. In addition, Japanese merchants are closing out many long positions. Fortunately, the yarn market is firm and rising, tightening market sentiment somewhat. However, underlying goods are relatively scarce, and consumption is also sluggish.</p>
<p>▲ Hankow Standard Drops One or Two Cash</p>
<p>The opening price of Hankow Standard in the morning session fell following the trend of foreign cotton. The second session rose with the yarn market, resulting in a drop of five fen to two and a half cash. The afternoon was flat, with the far month rising five fen to one cash. The total transaction volume for the day was 89,000 piculs. Purchases included: Feng 4,600 piculs, Jifeng 1,500 piculs, Rongxing 1,600 piculs. Sales included: Gongtai 3,200 piculs, Xinheng 5,900 piculs, Shenda 1,700 piculs. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton Both Trend Weak</h3>
<p>▲ U.S. Cotton Falls 30 Points</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, a weak Wall Street, and sales from the West, resulting in poor market conditions. Futures fell 25 to 28 points, and spot prices fell 30 points. British cotton futures fell 5 points, and spot prices fell 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 10 points. Indian cotton was weak due to sales from European exporters and speculators. Pingor and Omra fell 3 rupees, and White Broach fell 5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (dated the 18th):</p>

<h3>Silk, Tea, and Foreign Firms: Silk Market Continues to be Firm</h3>
<p>In European and American markets, sales from Chinese silk factories are gradually picking up. However, Japanese silk opening prices are not high, making it difficult to expect continued price increases for electro-spun silk, and transactions are not smooth. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others imported 40 bales of Shanghai white factory silk, and Samsung and others imported 20 bales of yellow coarse silk. Prices are still firm.</p>
<h3>Summer Silkworm Diseases Discovered in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>In Gaosi, Sanbao, Linping and other places in Hangzhou, summer silkworms were hatched early this year and the feeding amount was increased to make up for the shortage of spring cocoons. Since entering summer, the weather has been sunny and warm, which is very suitable for silkworm rearing. The ants hatched quite evenly and developed smoothly. The early batches have already entered the third sleep and started eating leaves. However, since the day before yesterday, after two days and nights of moldy rain, the temperature dropped sharply, and the silkworm ants underwent changes. Farmers were careless in feeding the leaves, and the silkworms ate wet leaves, causing diarrhea. The instructors are now trying to isolate the affected silkworms.</p>
<h3>Qimen Black Tea Sales to Europe Improve</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black tea from Qimen's upper and middle villages, including Tianyu, Jinlong, Xingcheng, and Dued, all started operations, and transactions became more active. Sales prices ranged from 57 taels to 170 taels, 20 to 30 taels lower than last week. The overall trend of Luzhuang Zhenmei green tea remains sluggish. In yesterday's market, first-class firms in England, France, and Japan only had a slight appetite for core-extracted Zhenmei, with little activity for the rest. Although a small number of Wuyuan North Road goods arrived in Shanghai for sampling, the market has been poor recently, and dealers are demanding strict prices, so no new quotations have been released. The future of green tea is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Markets Affected by Rainy Weather</h3>
<p>▲ Xin Zha, Yesterday</p>
<p>About twenty ships arrived at various wharves on Lu Road. Market sales have become more active due to the moldy rain. In addition, most cargo owners have suffered heavy losses and intend to sell to recover their costs. Top-quality Changshu Beigeng rice remains flat, while second-quality Zhongguan Suxi rice rose by 2 jiao. Early and late rice from sand boats sold well on the road, and the situation also improved by about 1 jiao. The glutinous rice market is mediocre, without any rise or fall. Foreign Dujian rice and local imports are still strong, and transactions of top-quality Dujian are not weak, with the situation tightening. Although the supply of Dujian and Kejian rice is limited, it is still available, and there are no major changes in the overall market.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai South</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the weather was windy and rainy, and the arrival of goods at various wharves remained sparse. Sales in local shops were even slower, and there were few customers. Due to the rain, Hehe rice was scarce, and the supply of fresh rice continued to increase, stabilizing the price. Given this moldy market, the situation is stable. The sales of thin rice are ordinary, and although foreign Dujian rice is scarce, the appetite for it is sluggish, and the market is weak. Through changes and adjustments, workshops are still buying in large quantities, so the situation has dropped by 1 jiao. The opening for each type of rice was 600-700 dan. Today is the Lunar Dragon Boat Festival, and both the North and South markets will suspend rice transactions for one day.</p>
<h3>Woolen Piece Goods and Fine Serges are Soaring</h3>
<p>The woolen piece goods market is rising rapidly. Yesterday, fine serges in particular showed a strong upward trend. In recent days, Sichuan merchants have been actively purchasing, and yesterday Tianjin and Changsha also showed activity. In addition, overseas quotations are rising steadily, leading to exceptionally good sentiment among holders of goods. Yesterday, prices rose by about 1 fen each. Sanyou Tu Changjiang merchants sold at 3 qian 4 fen 7 li and a half, Tu Yuan also reached 3 qian 3 fen and a half, Huxin Ting 3 qian 5 fen and a half, Baoqiu 3 qian 9 fen 7 li and a half, Gucheng 4 qian. Lower-quality goods such as Qianliju, Gongsun Tu, and Hele Tu are even more scarce. Zhigong woolen cloth also rose, with Zhuhu reaching 3 qian 1 fen and a half, Sanyou Tu Dongmian selling at 3 qian 5 fen, and Lieyan also being in short supply. Moqianshan has reached 3 qian 8 fen and a half. The futures market for Sima Xiangru's Yangtze merchants is also strong. White ting cloth and white hemp yarn, which had previously declined, have now turned from falling to rising, due to speculators taking the opportunity to purchase. Yesterday, ting cloth was around 2 qian, and hemp yarn has all gone out of customs at 2 qian. Fine cloth has been rising sharply in recent days due to the surge in local factory goods, and eastern goods have also seen sharp increases. Yesterday, Shile Bird was at 9 taels and 7 qian and a half, and Yueyan was at 10 taels and a half.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Definite News of Poor Harvest of Jinshan Chestnuts</h3>
<p>▲ Market Price is One-Third Higher than the Current Market</p>
<p>News of the scarcity of new Jinshan chestnuts and poor harvest has been spreading in Shanghai for some time. According to reliable sources, the price of fresh chestnuts has already been set. If they are processed into dried chestnuts, they will have to be priced one-third higher than the current Shanghai market price. Therefore, merchants in Shanghai who have old stock are unwilling to sell them cheaply, and the trend is very firm, with expectations of further price increases in the future.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Rising Prices in Japanese Car Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market reports from producing areas: the price of Cuban spot sugar was 1.34375, a slight increase of 0.03125 compared to the previous telegram.

In the exchange market, the buying interest for Dutch sugar No. 24 was very quiet, with the offering price at 11 taels and 7 qian, and No. 20 medium-sized white sugar at 11 taels and 1 qian, both with few inquiries. No. 10 Dutch red sugar was at 9 taels 9 qian 7 fen and a half, and the goods were not high, but the market sentiment was very strong. The Japanese sugar market saw a slight increase, with Z mark at 11 taels 2 qian and a half, SH mark at 11 taels 1 qian and a half, TM mark at 11 taels 2 qian 2 fen and a half, YT mark at 11 taels 3 qian to 3 qian 2 fen and a half, YP mark at 11 taels 7 qian, YPO mark at 10 taels 9 qian 7 fen and a half to 11 taels, Taikoo DY mark at 11 taels 2 qian to 2 qian and a half, and B mark at 11 taels and a half. The market situation is quite strong, and the offering price has been raised again, but buyers are holding back, indicating a potential stalemate.</p>

<h3>After Seeing "The Liar"</h3>
<p>— Jingzhai</p>
<p>Speaking of the two words "drama" inevitably makes us think of the so-called year of drama – just passed the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, in this year, the drama movement was truly at its peak. Although the result of this effort did not give us satisfying achievements, it may not be that it did not give us some new enlightenment regarding the drama movement. This, in our immature art scene where everything lags behind, especially in the aspect of dramatic art, is always a fact worth being joyfully optimistic about. However, in our country where everything is unfortunate, it seems that there is a god presiding over everything. All undertakings only have a fleeting fate. Our drama movement also failed to pass this stage and eventually declined with the passing of the year of drama. How sad this is for those who care.</p>
<p>Recently – after the call for the drama movement has been silent for a long time – our movement, which has suffered many setbacks, has begun to move in various aspects again. The unrestrained nature of this trend has greatly formed a phenomenon of revival or restoration. As far as we know, the earliest is the public performance of "A Patriot's Heart" by the Jing'e Drama Society, the public performance of "Mei Luo Xiang" by the Zhonggong Drama Society, and the Su Ni Drama Society is preparing for a public performance. These all indicate a vigorous atmosphere. In particular, the eleventh public performance of "The Liar" by the Fudan Drama Society is the most prominent and largest in scale.</p>
<p>The Fudan Drama Society, as they themselves said, "slowly transformed from the nature of recreation to a purely research drama art group." The reason why they have achieved this result is really due to their environment – Fudan University has a hard-working academic atmosphere, and the drama courses offered by Fudan University are complete. With this, in this innate and thick element, a "Cyrano" child that caused a sensation was born. Following this child, what was conceived and born was "The Liar," the public performance that I am going to talk about now, whose reputation is no weaker than that of his brother "Cyrano."</p>
<p>"The Liar" is said to be a flawless work by Jones, a complete comedian from England. Judging from the name, of course, what is expressed in this play is the fact of "lying". But it is not entirely so. Now, in order to make it easier for readers to understand, I might as well give a brief explanation here.</p>
<p>The cause of the matter is that a love story that young people often perform occurred between Mr. Zhang Jingkai, who had just come to Shanghai from Nanyang, and the wife of Mr. Ye Menghua, a giant merchant in Shanghai. Naturally, this matter was not approved by the friends and relatives of both parties. They all came up with many ways to persuade these two protagonists, but as a result, the persuasion failed. Later, by coincidence, these two lovers met in a hotel. Naturally, the coincidence mentioned here is just a lie. At the same time, even more coincidentally, Mrs. Ye's husband's brother also came at this time. So this matter was about to get big. In order to save these two protagonists, their friends decided on a lie that could justify itself after careful deliberation. But unfortunately, the lie was exposed again. In this way, this matter was almost brought to an irreparable situation. But Mr. Lin Wangxian, a friend who was smart, experienced, understood everything, and knew everything, seized the opportunity at this time and did not let it go, finally making this couple, who was about to break up, reconciled again. And Mr. Zhang Jingkai, who was originally a heroic and daring passionate lover, also woke up from the dream of love, knowing that there were more important tasks on his shoulders than love, and ended his own romantic play.</p>
<p>Although the content of this script has so many twists and turns, it has completely conveyed it in only four acts. Therefore, in each of its acts, there are many tense flavors buried. So if we are just standing on the position of drama to speak, then this "Liar" is indeed a very perfect good work with the magic of attracting people. But if we think that the success of an artistic work must grasp the spirit of the times and be able to promote a social effect, then this "Liar" is just a common story. In addition to obtaining considerable effects in terms of technology, it did not show any great significance. This is because we did not find an amazing great character and miracle in this play. Every character and every accident in it is just rolling around in the strong and stubborn traditional social morality network. This is inevitably going to make people feel a little pity.</p>
<p>Regarding the plot of this "Liar", I have said some above. Now let's talk about other aspects.</p>
<p>The success or failure of a play is related to the actors. I think I don't need to say more. This is the first important thing that everyone knows. When we make an overall observation of the actors in "The Liar" this time, it is indeed very rare, worthy of neatness and not bad criticism. But if we want to make individual criticisms, then the one that I want to mention first is not the two protagonists, but a key role, Mr. Tang Xuanfan who plays Lin Wangxian. Although it is said that this gentleman's disguise as a ghostly hermit is still an attempt, we have to admit that he has reached the point of success. Although we can't say that he is perfect, his lines are so thoughtful and fluent, and his demeanor is so leisurely and unrestrained, everywhere showing that he is a well-thought-out and worldly-wise figure. At the same time, he also carries a lot of interesting expressions. This role is really too suitable. This is the most outstanding of these many actors. The next thing to say is of course the female protagonist, Ms. Li Lian, who plays Mrs. Ye. Ms. Li is indeed a rare person with stage talent. The role she played in this play is also very appropriate. Except that she speaks too fast and all her actions and actions have committed a flaw of being too impetuous, everything else can give people a satisfactory comfort. Speaking of Ms. Liang Peiyu, then we should still remember the female protagonist in "Cyrano". Yes, this is an all-rounder with a very generous and calm attitude, very delicate and thoughtful expressions, and very mellow and clear lines. It is a pity that because her position in the play is not very important, we have not been able to fully look up to all her strengths. The other ladies can also do it in an orderly manner, suitable for their own position in the play, although small flaws are also inevitable, especially Ms. Lv Manyun who plays Miss Ma, her facial expressions are worthy of being top-notch, especially her charming eyes. But it is a pity that her attitude is too lacking in dignity, and she has also committed the fault of being too much. It is inevitable that she lacks the humorous and shy demeanor of being a young lady. If this were replaced by a woman who is good at charming and used to showing off her style, then this expression would be praised endlessly. As for the male roles, generally speaking, they can still be competent. However, Mr. Wu Zhongmin, who plays Zhang Jingkai, has too few facial expressions. There is always a tone on his face, and there are few opportunities to make people distinguish that he has expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. This is his personal shortcoming. If Mr. Kong Lingjue, who plays Ye Menghua, is the worst in degree among these key roles. In short, the neatness of the actors this time is considered very rare.</p>
<p>We know that the meaning and mission of the drama club movement is not only to mature in technical aspects, but also to end the matter. Its greatest and most important meaning is that it can produce a social effect. Therefore, here, all our comrades who are working hard in the drama movement must know that our success is in many aspects, containing a central consciousness. The fit of the performance, the beauty and profoundness of the plot, these are still secondary issues. Therefore, if we ask the gentlemen of the Fudan Drama Society, do they also think so?</p>

<h3>Treating Diseases with Jiashu</h3>
<p>— Xu Sifang</p>
<p>Since I entered the world, I have been down and out, depressed and sad, so a lump rose on my chest, like a stone egg, and occasionally when I felt it, it swelled and pained like a chicken egg. It was a blessing if it did not swell or hurt at ordinary times. I have been treated by famous Chinese and Western doctors, but it was ineffective. It has been more than ten years. Recently, I returned to Shanghai from Zhejiang Province after resigning from my post. Touching the present and feeling the past, I felt sad everywhere, and the lump broke out severely. I thought it had been accumulated for a long time and it was difficult to heal. It should not be treated with medicine, and I could only wait to die. Then I read a newspaper saying that Yu Dian Passerby, No. 18 Simingli, (at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Luban Road in the French Concession,) advertised for treating diseases with Jiashu, and I felt that it was sincere and moving, not comparable to the common quacks who lied to the world. Moreover, because I could not bear the pain, I sincerely went to seek treatment with my roommate. I felt that the room was clean and pleasant. I registered and was invited into the upstairs room. I saw a person sitting in the middle, about thirty or forty years old, twisting prayer beads in his hand, with a calm and solemn expression, and respectful appearance. I asked his name, and he was Mr. Lao Jingdian from Hunan. He kindly said to me, "Jia is Yin and Yang. Jiashu is using Yin and Yang numerology to relieve suffering. It cannot be said that it can be effective if you start. It also depends on the fate of the person seeking treatment. We only use the scriptures to cultivate the Tao and visit friends. Therefore, we must first ask for the eight characters of the year of birth to see if there is fate. In particular, the person seeking treatment must make a wish. Our Taoism is based on abstaining from killing and releasing life as its purpose. If you cannot immediately observe vegetarianism, you must make a wish to abstain from killing one living creature, no matter how big or small, according to your wish, or swear to abstain from killing one cow, or one snail. You must swear that you will never eat this one cow or one snail for the rest of your life before you can be treated. Therefore, we are aware that in modern times, morality has collapsed, and we sincerely hope to use this to prevent friends and jointly maintain this Taoism. People in the world do not know the hard work of the ancient sages and saints in establishing the Tao and saving the world. They fail to know the preciousness of our country's philosophy, and use the two words 'superstition' to generalize and obliterate, which leads to the concealment of the great Tao. Therefore, we want to widely seek people with fate to cultivate the great Tao together." Then he said that the symptoms are painful, because the Qi and blood are not smooth, so if it is smooth, it will not hurt. It must be that the body feels wind, fire, phlegm, and dampness, which obstruct the flow of Qi and blood, so it causes pain. The treatment is to remove these four diseases to dredge the Qi and blood and make them flow smoothly without obstruction. Two Taoist talismans should be drawn with a cinnabar pen (divided into You talisman and Jia talisman), and taken home at 11 o'clock at night. Burn three incense sticks, prepare a basin of clean water, first burn the You talisman, and then swear at that time to abstain from killing any living creature, then burn the Jia talisman in the clean water, and then take three mouthfuls of water. The pain should stop, and come again in three days. He should talk about the principles in detail, and give a plaster to paste under the human character bone, that is, the affected area. He said that if after pasting, you feel that the pain is getting worse, and there is sticky liquid sucked out from the affected area, it is a good phenomenon. It does not hurt to wipe the liquid away and paste it again. This is to gather the disease in one place and expel it through the pores. If the pain does not increase, then the effect is not effective, and come again in three days. Surgery should be used to massage or acupressure to treat it. The intention of the surgery is also to gather the disease in one place and expel it. Sometimes, it is necessary to cut the skin a little to provide an outlet. This is a simple way, and it is also a fundamental way to eliminate it. Then he took it home and pasted it. One day, he unconsciously increased the pain, and he also felt that the usual pain was lost. The so-called sticky liquid was exposed, but it was not seen. After three days, he went again, and Mr. Lao used surgery, slightly massaged, and cut the skin a little with a small knife. A reddish-brown sticky liquid flowed out, about a teacup, and the disease was lost as if nothing had happened. It was really magical. According to him, this liquid was formed by accumulated diseases. Now he is ordered to continue to paste the plaster on the affected area, and go again in three days to examine my constitution. If it is not healthy, I am still afraid that the disease has not been cleared, and all three times, the disease will be removed. The only cost is one yuan for the first registration, which is to pay for the servants. Yu Dian Passerby and Mr. Lao are dedicated to saving the world, borrowing the Tao to visit friends, and working together to create the great Tao, maintaining the philosophy passed down by the ancient sages and saints, so that people can get rid of diseases and extend their lives. Every day, I hear their servants say that only three people are allowed. I dare to use my own experience to swear to prove that it is not like a quack who lies to the world and borrows techniques to collect money. I also heard that men and women can be cured of various diseases, and the premise is whether there is fate. It is said that the great Tao is mysterious and subtle, and people dream. Those who have fate, one finger points out the maze, and they immediately realize. Those who have no fate, the great Tao is in front of them, and there is no way to follow. This news is difficult to explain in words without prior wisdom.</p>
