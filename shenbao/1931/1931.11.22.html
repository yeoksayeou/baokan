<p>聽取中日代表意見</p>
<p>討論派遣調查團案</p>
<p>日本態度仍未稍變</p>
<p>（巴黎）　國聯歷史上又一重要會議、將於今日下午四時三十分開會、此爲十六日重開後第二次公開會議、但其前途定將又造成一僵局、目下中國代表團計劃、旣力主考慮其撤兵要求、而日代表則宣稱、將在會中堅持派遣委員爲一事、撤兵問題爲另一事、各不相關、倘國聯决定派遣委員、日本將要求請美國致仕參謀總長孫墨拉爾將軍爲委員長、至於撤兵必須在中日直接外交談判結果之後、並謂派遣調查委員計劃、苟非兩方面有一方讓步、結果必致失敗、日代表芳澤又謂渠並不如國聯秘書廳之樂觀、國聯欲派調查委員赴東三省、自可立即派遣、但中國之必須承認日方基本五原則乃中日談判上另一問題、日本對於停戰提議並未有切實答復、若謂日本已决定反對、亦非確語、至撤兵問題猶未解决、仍待繼續討論、當此談判未停之時、全國須有希望、但不能謂余抱有樂觀、但若談判能於今後數日内結束、余亦並不驚異云云、按芳澤此言、其意不啻暗示國際聯盟、將永不能調解東三省事件也、現理事會已决定星期日不開會議、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　國聯秘書廳昨夜正式宣稱、中日接受停戰原則之說、未免又蹈過分樂觀之弊、日政府旣拒絕停戰建議、今日中國總代表施肇基博士亦向美聯社通訊員切實否認中國已接受停戰計劃之原則、並否認接受日本提議之調查委員、謂目下中國代表團尙未接到南京訓令、若理事會大會内提出日本任何提議、中國代表當然將加以討論、但對於調查委員即使在原則上之接受與否、亦須全視該委員與撤兵之關係以爲斷、又今晨十時四十五分、施氏曾與道威斯相晤、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　當秘書廳宣告中日兩國接受休戰以前、中國代表團曾語人、尙未正式接到國聯派遣調查委員會提議、且云此類提議、預料恐亦不能爲中國接受、曩日本在瀋陽附近開始撤兵之時、調查委員會之議可爲中國所接受、今則惜已太晚、中國代表團堅持必須先行撤兵、而後有調查之可言、委員會祗能隨撤兵而產生、今理事會所擬議者、純爲一調查情形之委員會、苟不先之以撤兵、祗有宣傳作用而已、中國固常贊成一調查委員會、但理事會今在特别會議時期、必須處置撤兵問題、中國將堅持此點云云（二十日國民社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日本政府關於混合國聯調查委員團派遣案、主張須依如左之條件、業已致諿電於其芳澤代表、（一）調查員不僅視察滿洲、須視察全中國、（一）此等調查員對於旣往之軍事行動、槪不批評、（一）在調查員視察期中、若中日兩國間開始直接交涉、亦一槪不得干涉、（一）須令調查委員格外詳細調查者、爲抵制日貨之事實、中國維持治安之能力、及中國曾誠實履行國際條約否、（二十一日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　國聯理事會今日秘密會議結果、遠東局勢頓增和平解决之希望、理事會秘密會議自下午四時開會至六時方散、中日代表仍未列席、今日兩小時討論之結果、今夜並未正式公布、惟據確訊、昨夜日代表芳澤提陳白里安之日本最近建議、理事會對此頗爲嘉許、日本之新提案依允國聯遣派特别調查團赴華、惟以兼事調查全中國抗日情形、而不限於調查滿洲形勢爲條件、日本新提案並表示願意暫不堅持五點基本原則、惟亦有附帶條件、即須中國承認現行條約在原理上之有效、及並允開始談判條約之解釋事宜、該項談判可由中立國遣派代表參加、但不必先之以撤兵是、今日理事會秘密集議時、聞白里安對此建議予以贊同、白里安現已病愈、會内會外頗見活躍、理事會已爲白里安之利口所說服、贊成日本之新提案、視爲解决遠東糾紛之方法、至於調查團員地位問題、挪威代表主張國聯調查團團員、當認爲個人之代表、而非國家之代表、今日理事會亦予贊同、議畢白里安即與中國首席代表施肇基長談、聞施代表對於國聯遣派調查團並不反對、惟悉施博士同時已將中國先撤兵後交涉之原來要求提醒白里安、並認理事會現正態度大變、遠不如前矣、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　國聯秘書廳正式宣稱、中日兩國已在原則上接受東三省休戰提議、理事會定於星期六下午四時在法外部舉行公開會議、按公開會議之舉行、係今日下午秘密會議時决定、秘密會議係自下午四時二十分開會、至六時散會、各理曾縝密研究派遣調查委員會赴東三省計劃、並决定請中日代表於星期六下午在公開會議當衆說明期當事國政府對於調查委員會計劃所處之地位、再說明對於在調查完畢以前、東三省中日軍隊不得有何對敵行動、應保持休戰狀態之提議、兩當事國政府所處之地位、聞今日十二理事在秘密會議内咸贊成派遣一中立調查委員會、由公王美人发潘興將軍道威斯將軍、（即駐英美大使）及休士（美大理院院長）一流人物提任委員長、據稱、中日代表對於休戰提議已接受原則、但將提出何種保留、則猶未發表、今日國聯中人聞此消息、莫不有顯著之樂觀、多數理事表示此次理事會特别會議、大約至下星期二可以完畢、若星期六公開會議中、中日代表宣布接受原則的解釋能獲一美滿結局、則料將延會至下星期二再開、現德代表蒲洛已準備星期六返柏林、英代表西門業於星期四返倫敦、此後倘無新困難發生、料將不復來巴黎、又聞十二理事曾論及中日軍隊宣告休戰一事、應作爲涉及原則問題之一條件現日代表芳澤雖無正式文書致理事會、但已私向白里安表示温和態度、至中國方面此間以爲中國原屬贊成派遣調查委員會、惟此時之能否接收斯議、將完全視乎其撤兵要求之若何處置、此點亦屬大可注意者、料中日代表在星期六會議中對於撤兵問題、將俱有正式宣言也、當今日秘密會議開會以前、國聯空氣本甚緊張、據確訊、道威斯語白里安、美政府認東三省時局每小時輒增嚴重、但道氏仍堅主不參加理事會正式討論、第願合作以期調解、並向白里安表示當理事會有最後决議時、渠準　備與白里安討論之、（二十日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　今晚國聯方面皆抱樂觀、因日本已允國聯遣派委員團實地研究滿洲情形也、日本之依允、附有若干條件、此項條件、將爲明日或下星期中公開會議之討論事件、惟日本旣槪括的授受此計畫、時局已失其緊張、而昨日所呈露之恐慌情緒、遂銷滅於無形、聞行政會於派員調查時、將主張在滿洲設立一種中立區域、及雙方擔任停止仇敵行動、及各種挑　舉動、　言之、即宣佈停戰是也、白里安在行政會言及中國態度、謂　　中國方面不至有任何不近情理之反對渠料定中國在某種保障下、可允派員調查云、華盛頓來電、據稱、如被邀請、美國定可加入國際調查團、行政會會員在散走以前、就法外部所供給之餐室進食、緊張空氣、已變爲好意的與寛慰的空氣、任何方面皆以爲解决困難之法、業已覓得、衆意委員團辦法之詳則、非明日所能完全解决、故下屆會議將於星期一或星期二日舉行之、但未有可慮發生生嚴重阻力之理由、一般印象以爲國聯行政會之眞正嚴重工作、現已完成、日本關於派員赴滿調查之提議、予調查團以調查各種要素之極大範圍、不獨軍事、即政治要素、如日人所謂之中國不遵守條約、及國民黨在中國政策上所有勢力等事、亦在調查之列、但委員團之遣派、未必涉及日本之撤兵、此事仍將由日人酌行之、首先緊於日本對於日僑生命財產安全是否滿意、亦緊於中國是否願意與日本談判一種條約、以解决所爭各問題、行政會午後四時開會、中日代表皆未出席、會塲中自始即有較爲樂觀之語調、衆皆覺派員調查已成定議、不過以何種形式提交中國、則今猶未定、行政會一致定派調查團赴滿洲之提議、乃解决目前危局之適當方法、並决定明日舉行公開會議、以聽取中日代表之陳述、並决定最後細則、但聞明日會議决不致有意見上之大衝突、行政會集議兩小時、六時休會、衆知行政會所採之途徑或不免於若干　議、然在此環境中、辦法莫善於此、聞日人對於調查團事提出條件、載明該團除調查違背條約事、亦應調查反日之杯葛行爲、及中國各處之反日活動、但此種條件、及調查團其他辦法、須在公開會議時製定之、今日行政會之討論、略及此數點、尤注重者爲選擇公正重要人物之必要、今日行政會旣有此决定、十月二十四日行政會之議案、殆成具文、而懲戒建議亦掃蕩凈盡、人或將對於國聯之效用、加以批評、斥其無脊骨、但國聯中人自詡國聯之勸試雙方、已阻止戰爭、而杜禍事之蔓延、國聯秘書處發表日代表來文、其言曰、「種種惱人之計畫、與仇敵之行動、兩國所定各條約與恊定之有統系的破壞、欲奪回日人合法所得</p>

<p>日政府忽訓令反對</p>
<p>（東京）　巴黎傳來關於國聯行政會昨日集議情形之報告、已引起此間顧慮、以爲芳澤依允滿洲休戰、越出訓令範圍、日本接受遣派國際調查團前往中國與滿洲調查中日間糾紛根本原因之提議、但電致芳澤諭其拒絕休戰、官塲稱休戰建議、含有戰事狀態存在之意、且休戰將使中國集中逾二十萬人之軍隊於滿洲、以拒一萬五千之日兵、故日本不能依允休戰、以免對於中國大批兵匪而謀自衛之手腕、受其拘束、中國兵匪簡直不分云、致芳澤拒絕休戰之訓令、昨夜發出、但芳澤似已向白里安表示其個人對此提議未有反對矣、故外務省深慮芳澤不待政府訓令、遽自負責承認之、但據官塲意見、芳澤縱已承認之、日政府不能認自己受束縛也、此爲日本對於休戰之切實地位、但同時官塲謂在某種條件下、亦未嘗不可議定休戰、而停止中國境内抗日工作、當如停止滿洲軍事行爲、同爲停戰條件之一、若休戰之說、僅作不侵略之解、則日本甚願依允之、因日本早已對於九月三十日之國聯議案、聲明非侵略矣、日本覺國聯於一二星期前日本請國聯注意於北滿馬占山集兵於齊齊哈爾與昻昻溪險、勢日增之時、即應對華發出嚴厲警告云、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　一月前日本報紙及一般民衆皆舉芳澤爲傑、以其能隻手應付國聯、保障日本在滿地位也、今日則深責芳澤不應依允無條件的休戰、現有一部份民衆要求改以松平爲日本總代表、一般輿情似芳澤始終未將日本態度適當告知其他代表、且以爲休戰問題、今非其時、因日本甫於擊潰齊齊哈爾軍隊之後、今又有錦州方面傳說華兵五萬人集中之惶慮、若宣佈無條件之休戰、是使華人復能集其大軍於他處、而日軍於被迫行動以除危害時、將有破壞休戰之罪名也、（二十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　據此間某軍事要員今日聲稱、近兩月内滿洲日軍已實行「疾搫速擊」之格言矣、此爲以寡敵衆之唯一安全途徑、如張學良集兵錦州之說果確、則第三次試騐同一原則、恐爲期已不遠矣、聞張學良現於錦州集兵五萬餘人、預備攻擊新民與瀋陽、渠意日當局似將予以警告、如張置之不顧、則日本恐不得不再施疾擊速擊之行動也、錦州方面旣有發生嚴重戰事之徴象、齊齊哈爾之日軍或須提早撤回、日軍今切欲將北滿之危害掃蕩凈盡、庶可將大隊兵士由北滿撤回、俾遇需要時、得用命於錦州方面、所幸日本開出瓜代滿洲戍軍之混成旅、已於昨日開抵瀋陽、如在朝鮮混成旅之受瓜代者未開回原防之前、錦州方面有發生戰事之虞、則新抵瀋陽之軍可從而助戰、該員末謂中國當局或對於集軍之舉、振振有詞、但兩軍相距過近、而日軍人數又遠遜於中國、自不免引起日人之恐慌、此所以日人對於國聯無條件休戰之議、不勝惶慮、蓋恐中國可因此以無紀律之大隊兵士分集滿洲各處也、渠意如須防杜戰事之再見、國聯當以照此狀態屯集軍隊、有使時局更增嚴重之虞警告中國云云、（二十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　路透社訪員從最高方面探悉、行政會昨日集會時、並未用「休戰」名詞、但僅用「停止仇敵行爲」「停止挑釁舉動」及「中立區域」等語、且僅於因派員赴滿調查之提議、而言及雙方佈置時始用之、數日前非公開會議中曾偶用「休戰」名詞、旋以其含義糾纏、立即拒用之、（二十一日路透社電）</p>

<p>國聯行政會自第三次集會以來。多作秘密恊議。迄無公開之討論。當列國外交家秘籌劃之日。亦正日軍以飛機重砲殘酷轟擊奪取我齊齊哈爾之時。巴黎方面所播出之和平歌曲。絕有能掩蔽日軍在我東北重砲轟擊之巨響。列國外交家所揭舉之公理與正義。絕不能制止日軍在我東北之瘋狂暴行。國聯究爲何事而集議。誠爲舉世人民所大惑不解。</p>
<p>據十九日巴黎電訊。謂芳澤遞交白里安致國聯覺書。阻止國際考察團前赴東北考察。並謂非中國與之直接交涉。承認條約權利後。决不撤兵。二十日電訊。則謂日本已贊成國聯派遣調查委員團之議。惟其委員。須由彼認可調查任務之範圍。須預爲規定除調查治安問題外。即中日通常關係以及中國政府有無尊重條約之能力等。皆在調查之内。是則此次調查委員團之遣派。非調查日本方面之暴行。亦非調查滿案種種事實而直爲日本調查我全中國之狀况。並且非特不允撤兵。更直截爽快表示不允休戰。此種蠻横無理已逹極點之舉動。吾人敢斷言日本已决心破壞和平。根本予國聯以威信上之致命打擊。使其不能繼續維繫。質言之即不啻向全世界全人類表示宣戰。</p>
<p>自九月十八日以至今日。時逾兩月。日本之陰謀野心。早已經深思熟慮。胸有成算。我國家以尊重國聯威信之故。一再退讓。而國聯則一再遷延。迄無具體有效之處置。始則有十月十三日以前日軍儘先撤退之勸告。二次集會。復有十一月十六日十三票對一票之决議。然而國聯一次勸告。日軍之暴行。反愈　　大。因一次　　而有　州之　　。因二次决議而有天津之變亂。茲當國聯第三次集議之時。而又有齊齊哈爾之佔領。我東北半壁山河。全淪於日人之手。國聯威信。亦遭受重大創傷。不能謂非我國太信賴國聯與國聯敷衍遷延有以致之。據外電謂十九日各國代表聽完日代表决不撤兵之聲言。都面面相覷。吾不知今日各代表聽得日本拒絕白里安休戰勸告之訊。爲難又將如何耶。</p>
<p>爲維護世界和平而聯盟之國聯。處此情勢之下。將仍敷衍遷就坐看日人暴行擴大。自甘威信掃地。使盟約歸於瓦解耶。或更將扶强抑弱。助長日人兇燄。使全人類立呈恐怖慘毒之悲　耶。苟非然者。則惟有取當機立斷態度。與暴日以正當有效之裁制。會章十六條之援用。實不容斯須稍緩。蓋今日之事。可一言而决。國聯如有維護世界和平之决心。則請見之於實際之行動。無此决心。則請就此撤手。宣告公理破產和平絕望。俾列國各自準備應付迫在眉睫之屠殺。如再因循遷延。不作公開商討。秘密愈多。則危機固將愈大。然若爲欲求速了之故。抑制强日不得。轉而壓迫中國。强中國以承認先調查而後撤兵之要求。則是國聯掁身。先自背棄信約。非特國聯將立即崩潰。國聯會章頓成紙老虎。而禍患所至。實有不堪設想者。各代表亦稍有所覺悟否也。今之形勢。已到最後時機。國聯盟約。究有絕對之尊嚴歟。抑果爲欺騙弱小之廢紙歟。即將於此時顯示其最後之答案。</p>

<p>（一）依照國際聯合會行政院九月三十日决議案、及十月二十四日行政院會員十三國一致通過之决議案、中日兩國政府、各負避免侵略政策、及擴大事態之責任、而十月二十四日决議案、已經行政院主席正式指揮、具有完全道德上之力量、來照又特别提及十月三十日决議案第五第六兩項、是日政府亦深知其在行政院决議案規定下應盡之義務、乃自十月三十日起直至今日、日政府管轄之軍隊、無時不在中國領土内擴張其作戰行動、及即在戰爭中亦爲國際法所不許之行動、如十月二十三日飛機轟炸錦州之舉、各國已深爲震駭、近復變本加厲、竟至勒取中國國家税收、勾結匪類、供給槍械嗾使擾亂、侵佔區域及其附近之治安、天津日租界當局、利用其租界地位、容許大帮武裝、便衣隊、集合出發、攻擊政府機關、殺傷公務員及人民、一面依修理無權修理之嫩江橋爲名、進兵黑龍江省、向中國軍隊攻擊、並脅迫省政府當局、業經中國先後提出嚴重抗議、並指出日本政府重大之責任在案、據最近報告、日軍於本月十八及十九日竟已攻陷昻昻溪及齊齊哈爾、並先以飛機在齊齊哈爾抛擲炸彈、發散傳單、宣告攻取黑龍江省城堅决之意、顯係違反前項行政院决議案、如上述一切武力侵略行動、爲日本政府之旣定方針、則日本政府、對於國聯行政院十月三十日决議案、欣然參加、殊不可解、</p>
<p>（二）日本政府不先反省自責、而反謂中國人民自然而消極的屬於情感之表示、係違反行政院决議案、中國政府不能承認、中國人民處於日本積極侵略之下、憤慨已極、但對於日本僑民所取態度、亦僅自動偏向於商業關係、並無故意加害於生命或財產之事、而中國政府、除被日軍侵佔之區域外、對於日本人民、尤盡力予以保護、公平之第三者、關於中國政府與人民確守非戰公約及其他國際公約之信條、始終在法律範圍内、應付日本之横暴、方以爲可異、而日本政府未能先自覺悟其種種侵略行爲之非計、反於日軍侵佔威逼嚴重情形之下、强欲中國人民、恢復其平常之友誼、是誠倒果爲因、中國政府亦不得不指明於日本政府者、即侵佔中國各地之日本軍隊、一日不撤、原狀一日未復、侵略一日不止、則中國人民對於日本人民之感情、無從恢復、是定爲日本政府所瞭解者也、</p>
<p>（三）日本政府在國際公法國際盟約非戰公約、及華盛頓九國條約之下、又在國聯行政院九月三十日之决議時、及十月二十四日具有完全道德上力量决議案之下、早應同時完成撤兵、實無再加辯論之餘地、中國政府茲仍請日本政府、查明迭次去文、及國聯行政院主席十一月一日致日本政府之復文、急速改變旣往方針、與中國業已派定之接收委員、商訂撤退及接受細目、俾現在侵佔東北各地之軍隊、即日盡數撤退、而已被破壞之東亞和平、庶可因此得有轉機也、（二十一日專電）</p>

<p>（莫斯科）日本外務省永井星期四日以一牒文送交東京俄代使轉逹俄政府、内述日軍被迫越過中東路線之理由、永井代表日政府聲稱、日軍司令訓令前敵不得毁壞中東路線、俟新任命之華人衛兵司令到齊齊哈爾恢復秩序後、日軍即退出黑垣、向南撤回、但撤兵確期不能决定、惟據永井意思、四五日内或可撤兵、永井末復聲明日本對於蘇俄之友好態度、並一再聲明不損壞中東路線、駐俄日大使廣田於訪見俄外長李維諾夫時、亦以同様論調陳說一切、（二十一日路透社電）</p>

<p>昨日之一場大戰、史谷德全佔上風、前半局縱横陣地、不可一世、東華全處於壓迫之下、後半局、東華漸見轉勢、惜皆功虧一　、末後、因觀衆之一時衝動、秩序幸未亂、雙方亦見激烈、受傷者數人、以表演而論、史谷德確高人一等、聯絡純熱、攻射有力、以此球大半在英軍脚上、其克敵獲勝、固非偶然也、</p>

<p>下半時東華漸見轉勢、不若上半時之被人重迫、然來來往往、亦各無成效、半局過去大半、觀衆見奚巧生正在攻門、漢密登在旁衝撞、致未得中、二次如是、大起喧嘩、直則球規中有所謂合法的衝撞、自己糾紛、幾至不可收拾、於是雙方因觀衆之　動、漸見劇烈、周賢言漢密登、相繼受傷、尼爾被罰出場、一場大戰如是以終、吾以爲觀者、莫怪裁判、莫怨他人、且怪自己球運不佳耳、</p>

<p>國難聲中。靑年敵愾之緊張無論已。即六七十年前之產兒。現代中國之龍鍾老嫗。亦復激昻慷慨。充分表現其抗日救國之精神。此實吾人於萬分悲憤之中。所引爲獲得一分安慰者也。亟錄之以告國人。</p>
<p>北平十月二日電。張宗昌母頃由大連抵此。向人表示。效坤（即宗昌）絕不能作亡國奴。我也不能敎他做辱國之事。彼日内來平。倘有賣國行爲。我即自殺以謝國人。</p>
<p>南昌十月二日電。頃有老婦人大呼打倒倭奴。投章江自盡。</p>
<p>南京十月五日電。遼法院人員來京報告。臧式毅仍被暴日監視。日軍令簽字。臧不允大哭。謂老母七十。欲得一面而死。日員將其母送往南滿站。令一見。并令母勸臧。母云。古來城亡俱亡。汝寗死不要簽字。日軍乃遣之去。</p>
<p>哈爾濱十一月三日電。張作相衛隊馮占海團。於日軍入吉時。退出省垣。爲吉軍中退却之完整者。吉日軍警備部捕馮占海岳母松氏去。逼問馮團退却方向。并令作　招馮。松氏拒絕。爲毆傷垂斃。方釋還。</p>

<p>上海婦女救國大同盟會。爲慰水災曁東北被難同胞起見。本月二十日。在上海女子銀行五樓。開追悼會。悲慘情狀。筆難盡述。爰錄一二。以告各界。</p>
<p>會塲布置。與尋常不同。高懸「精神死未」四字立軸以代神位。旁有聯曰「保我河山。光我民族。領導惟諸先烈。」「攘彼狂寇。殺彼倭奴。繼起更有何人。」係兩江女子學校所輓。桌上供鮮花三瓶。不設祭菜香燭等物。由徐仁懿讀總理遺囑。楊錫珍向死難同胞獻花後。鞠躬而靜默誌哀。毛王瑞竹報告開會宗旨。詳述各省水災之慘狀。以及日人强佔東北之横暴行爲。令人不忍卒聞。黄紹蘭讀祭文。文長數千言。有何期一旦禍起蕭牆。燃箕煑豆。池魚受殃。膏血灑原。肝腦塗地。累百盈千。以至萬億。與身死可悲。心死尤慟等悲痛語。全塲肅穆。甚至泣下沾襟者。四壁所懸輓聯數十副。不克盡舉。將記憶所及。摘錄一二如下。「豹皮存乎。即吾輩極爲憤焉。時上書政府。時通電各方。對外須恢民國土。龍城失矣。望大家亟起國之。或助餉輸金。或披堅執鋭。同仇來助馬將軍」「勘亂禦侮。諸公競著先鞭。念靑史英名。永留模楷。取義成仁。吾儕願爲後繼。正黄花時節。合慰忠魂。」「諸同袍拚命救宗邦。只期繼起有人。問木屐兒頭顱幾許。我女界招魂奠國土。惟願衆心不死。拿忽必烈手段重來。」李冠芳謂中華民國。以國民爲主人翁。故我輩婦女之身份。與帝國皇后公主相等。須認國事爲己事。二十年來。對外開戰。係第一次。不幸失敗。其害伊於何底。戰士須抱必死之决心。我輩應將飾　變賣以助餉糈。黄紹蘭謂國必自伐。而後人伐。此次外禍。由内亂所自召。國民政府與軍閥時代不同。政府之上。旣冠國民二字。則凡屬國民。無分性别。對於大難當前。存亡危急之秋。應一致起來。請求政府。從速團結。一致對外。故本會今日擬有電稿。請立法院宋美齡宋靄齡張默君諸女士。轉呈政府。從速出兵。援救東北將倭奴趕出國境。以固國防。諸君如以爲然。請即舉手。全塲數百隻玉臂同時高舉。而以茶木蘭自任。僉謂人心未死。國尙可爲。遂依照所擬電稿而拍發。</p>

<p>— 理</p>
<p>本埠東南醫學院學生章淦君。日昨斷指以血寫宣誓一事。轟傳南市附近。章君不顧一切。斷指以示决心。其志可嘉。其情可憫。爰將其事顚末誌之。</p>
<p>組織援黑救護隊　該校學生鑒於馬占山將軍絕塞孤軍。與倭軍作殊死戰。養薄雲霄。功在國家。爲增加其實力起見。特組織援墨救護隊。一時報名參加者逹一百餘人。且多高級同學·學識豐富。該隊長章淦君。見狀甚言。即籌備赴黑曁募捐藥品事宜。</p>
<p>困難叢生　此次該隊長通告各隊員着每人將所有什物書籍。一律拍賣充盤川。各隊員　有難色。退出者不乏其人。結果只剩三十餘人。此該隊第一重困難也。該隊長又至各大藥房捐募藥品。結果亦大失所望。大有阻止進行之勢。章君無法可想。乃决犧牲一指以勵士氣。然猶秘不令人知其計劃也。</p>
<p>宣誓儀式　日昨章君佈告。謂定於下午舉行宣誓式。各隊員準時蒞臨。（僅剩餘之卅人）即在大操塲宣誓。各隊員甫將誓詞讀畢。章隊長即取利刃截斷中指。以血寫成誓詞一篇。衆大驚失色。而章隊長若無所事。謂衆曰。我若中途畏難而退。有如此指。隊員大爲感動。而在旁未加入之同學。亦頗有人因而加入。隊員人數遂由三十增至八十。章隊長於宣誓完畢後。即持斷指再向各大藥房募捐藥品。結果甚爲滿意。聞不日即將起程。由津浦折平綏。然後由張家口起程步行赴黑云。</p>

<p>馬將軍。眞將軍。忠肝義膽通風雲。倭冠陸梁侵我急。瀋吉崇朝先後失。養兵誰復固邊防。遂敎千里無堅壁。龍江隅豈不危。有公屹若長城立。横刀慷慨誓孤軍。好將馬革收吾骨。正氣由來泣鬼神。羽書一月三告捷。嗟哉國事近可傷。敢言禦侮搤其吭。亦有擁兵觀望。以舌擊賊聲琅琅。江橋戰苦陣雲黑。不聞外援趨朔方。收京勿復望李郭。公自無愧張睢陽。小子痛憤無尺鐵。短歌聊復寄胸臆。願公竟此汗血功。百鍊黄金鑄壯烈。（此詩甫脱稿、而黑垣已陷、彼坐視不救者、罪通於天矣、）</p>

<h3 id="c104">鄕下人又到上海　（二十四） <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>因此他這回到上海來，總算由上次得到了一個經騐，學到了一個乖，看見招牌上寫着某某飯店的，他知道這不是眞正的飯店，乃是個闊人睡覺的地方。他看見有許多打扮的妖妖嬈嬈的女人，從那種飯店裏，出出進進，他想起一句俗語來了。俗語說行好：「開了飯店弗怕大肚皮。」這本是說：儘管食量大的人進來，飯店裏也可以對付得過。現在上海的什麽飯店，什麽飯店，專門和女人睡覺的，這也應了那句-開了飯店弗怕大肚皮-的俗語；意思就是說：睏大了人家大姐姐的肚皮，也不要緊咧。</p>
<p>他知道上海有一條飯店弄堂，那個地方的飯店，纔眞是一個吃飯的所在，可是他不知道這飯店弄堂在那裏？有人說：「飯店弄堂已經拆去了，將來還要造幾層樓的什麽飯店，眞飯店要變成假飯店了。」他轉了一個灣，看見有許多店舖子，好像都是可以醫飽肚皮的。但是他有些兒膽怯，總不敢走進去。他那時又不得不問訊了。見了一位有鬍子的先生，便上前打了一個招呼，問道：</p>
<p>「對不起！老先生！借問一信！這裏有吃飯的地方嗎？」他所問的，恰巧是一位嘉定人，聽了老先生三字，心裏便有些老大不高興。要想發作幾句，一看是一個鄕下老頭兒，知道他出於無心，便忍住了。向他瞅了一眼，說道：</p>
<p>「吃飯的地方多得很，那左右兩邊，不都　是飯館子嗎？」那位嘉定老先生，隨手向左右一指，怱怱走開了。</p>
<p>鄕下人順着他所指的地方望去，却左邊兩個電燈的紅字，寫着「桃園」；右邊兩個電燈的紅字，寫着「梅園」。</p>
<p>他想：不好！只怕又要上人家的當了。桃園，梅園，這明明是個花園的名字，怎麽說是個吃飯的地方？我記得我們鎭上小茶館裏，春天裏來了一個說三國志演義的說書先生，他說什麽劉關張桃園三結義，不是有個桃園嗎？不想這裏也有一個桃園，只怕裏面還供奉着劉關張咧。至於梅園，聽說無錫也有一個梅園，到了梅花開放的當兒，去游玩的人很多，這明明也是一座花園，難道到了上海來，便變了飯館子了嗎？跑進花園裏去吃飯，可不又閙成了一個笑話兒嗎？</p>
<p>他猶豫了半晌，無奈飢腸雷鳴，只得走進了梅園。剛走進去，便直嚷道：「阿呀！果然是花園！而且還是動物園！」</p>

On the 18th, our troops retreated to the provincial capital. That night, the Japanese army advanced to the southern end of the provincial capital and engaged in fierce fighting with our troops for three hours. Our troops then led their forces to retreat east.

<h3 id="e11">League of Nations Administrative Council Holds Open Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Listens to the Opinions of Chinese and Japanese Representatives</p>
<p>Discusses the Dispatch of an Investigation Team</p>
<p>Japan's Attitude Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>(Paris) Another important meeting in the history of the League of Nations will be held at 4:30 PM today. This is the second open meeting since the reopening on the 16th, but its future is bound to create another stalemate. Currently, the Chinese delegation plans to strongly advocate for consideration of its demand for troop withdrawal, while the Japanese representative claims that he will insist on considering the dispatch of a committee as one matter, and the issue of troop withdrawal as another, unrelated matter. If the League of Nations decides to dispatch a committee, Japan will request that retired U.S. Chief of Staff General Summerall be the chairman. As for troop withdrawal, it must occur after the results of direct diplomatic negotiations between China and Japan. He also said that the plan to dispatch an investigation committee is bound to fail unless one of the two sides makes concessions. Japanese representative Yoshizawa also said that he is not as optimistic as the League of Nations Secretariat. The League of Nations wants to send an investigation committee to the Northeast, and it can be dispatched immediately, but China must recognize Japan's five basic principles as another issue in Sino-Japanese negotiations. Japan has not given a clear answer to the ceasefire proposal. It is not accurate to say that Japan has decided to oppose it. The troop withdrawal issue has not yet been resolved and remains to be discussed. During this negotiation, the whole country must have hope, but I cannot say that I am optimistic. But if the negotiations can be concluded within the next few days, I would not be surprised. According to Yoshizawa's words, his intention is nothing more than implying that the League of Nations will never be able to mediate the Northeast incident. The Council has now decided not to hold a meeting on Sunday. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Secretariat officially declared last night that the statement that China and Japan have accepted the principle of a ceasefire is overly optimistic. Japanese government has rejected the ceasefire proposal, today Chinese chief delegate Dr. Shih Chao-chi also firmly denied to the Associated Press correspondent that China had accepted the principle of a ceasefire plan, and denied accepting the Japanese proposal for an investigation committee, saying that the Chinese delegation had not yet received instructions from Nanjing. If any Japanese proposal is put forward in the General Assembly of the Council, the Chinese representatives will of course discuss it, but whether or not even in principle to accept the investigation committee will depend entirely on the relationship between the committee and the withdrawal of troops. Also, this morning at 10:45 AM, Shi met with Dawes. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) When the Secretariat announced that China and Japan had accepted the ceasefire, the Chinese delegation had told people that they had not yet formally received the proposal to dispatch an investigation committee from the League of Nations, and said that such a proposal was expected to not be accepted by China. When Japan began to withdraw troops near Shenyang, the proposal for an investigation committee could be accepted by China, but it is now too late. The Chinese delegation insists that troop withdrawal must precede any investigation. The committee can only arise after the troop withdrawal. What the Council is now proposing is purely a committee to investigate the situation. Without troop withdrawal first, it will only have a publicity effect. China has always supported an investigation committee, but the Council must deal with the issue of troop withdrawal during this special meeting period. China will insist on this point. (20th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's proposal regarding the dispatch of a mixed League of Nations investigation committee, advocating that it must be based on the following conditions, has already been telegraphed to its representative Yoshizawa: (1) The investigators must inspect not only Manchuria, but also all of China; (2) These investigators will not criticize past military actions; (3) During the investigators' inspection, if direct negotiations begin between China and Japan, they must not interfere in any way; (4) The investigators must be instructed to investigate in particular detail the facts of the boycott of Japanese goods, China's ability to maintain security, and whether China has honestly fulfilled international treaties. (21st Japanese Allied Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) As a result of today's secret meeting of the League of Nations Council, the hope for a peaceful resolution of the Far East situation has suddenly increased. The Council's secret meeting was held from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Chinese and Japanese representatives were still not present. The results of today's two-hour discussion were not officially announced tonight, but according to reliable sources, Japanese representative Yoshizawa presented Briand's recent Japanese proposals last night, which the Council greatly appreciated. The new Japanese proposal agreed to the League of Nations sending a special investigation team to China, but on the condition that it also investigate the anti-Japanese situation throughout China, and not be limited to investigating the situation in Manchuria. The new Japanese proposal also stated its willingness to temporarily not insist on the five basic principles, but with an attached condition, namely that China must recognize the validity of existing treaties in principle, and agree to begin negotiations on the interpretation of the treaty, and that neutral countries may send representatives to participate in the negotiations, but that this need not be preceded by troop withdrawal. Today, during the secret meeting of the Council, it was heard that Briand agreed with this suggestion, and Briand, who has now recovered from his illness, is quite active inside and outside the meeting. The Council has been persuaded by Briand's eloquence and supports the new Japanese proposal as a way to resolve the Far East dispute. As for the status of the members of the investigation team, the Norwegian representative argued that the members of the League of Nations investigation team should be considered representatives of individuals, not representatives of countries. Today the Council also agreed with this view. After the meeting, Briand had a long talk with Shi Zhaoji, the chief representative of China. It is heard that Shi did not oppose the League of Nations sending an investigation team, but Dr. Shi at the same time reminded Briand of China's original demand for negotiations after the troop withdrawal, and believed that the Council's current attitude had changed greatly and was not as good as before. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Secretariat officially announced that China and Japan had accepted the proposal for a ceasefire in the Northeast in principle. The Council is scheduled to hold an open meeting at the French Foreign Ministry at 4:00 PM on Saturday. According to the announcement, the holding of the open meeting was decided at a secret meeting this afternoon. The secret meeting was held from 4:20 PM this afternoon to 6:00 PM. All the members of the Council carefully studied the plan to dispatch an investigation committee to the Northeast, and decided to invite the Chinese and Japanese representatives to explain publicly at the open meeting on Saturday the position of their governments regarding the plan of the investigation committee, and to explain the position of the two governments regarding the proposal that there should be no hostile actions between the Chinese and Japanese troops in the Northeast and that a ceasefire should be maintained until the investigation is completed. It is heard that all twelve council members in the secret meeting today agreed to dispatch a neutral investigation committee, with figures such as Prince Gong, Ambassador Dawes (the U.S. Ambassador to Britain), and Hughes (Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court) as committee chairmen. It is claimed that the Chinese and Japanese representatives have accepted the principle of the ceasefire proposal, but what kind of reservations they will make has not yet been announced. Today, League of Nations personnel are notably optimistic about this news. Most council members indicated that this special meeting of the Council could be completed by approximately next Tuesday. If the Chinese and Japanese representatives announce an explanation of their acceptance of the principle at the open meeting on Saturday that achieves a satisfactory conclusion, then it is expected that the meeting will be extended until Tuesday next week. The German representative, Brüning, is already preparing to return to Berlin on Saturday, and the British representative, Simon, returned to London on Thursday. If no new difficulties arise thereafter, it is expected that he will not return to Paris. It is also heard that the twelve council members discussed the issue of the declaration of a ceasefire by the Chinese and Japanese troops, and that it should be made a condition involving a matter of principle. Although the Japanese representative Yoshizawa has no formal document to submit to the Council, he has privately expressed a moderate attitude to Briand. As for the Chinese side, it is believed here that China originally supported the dispatch of an investigation committee, but whether or not it can accept this proposal at this time will depend entirely on how its demand for troop withdrawal is handled. This point is also very noteworthy. It is expected that the Chinese and Japanese representatives will both have official declarations on the issue of troop withdrawal at the meeting on Saturday. Before the opening of the secret meeting today, the atmosphere in the League of Nations was very tense. According to reliable sources, Dawes told Briand that the U.S. government believes that the situation in the Northeast is becoming more serious every hour, but Dawes still insisted on not participating in the formal discussions of the Council, and was only willing to cooperate in order to mediate, and expressed to Briand that he was prepared to discuss with Briand when the Council had a final resolution. (20th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Tonight, the League of Nations is optimistic because Japan has agreed to the League of Nations sending a committee to conduct an on-the-spot study of the situation in Manchuria. Japan's agreement is subject to several conditions. These conditions will be the subject of discussion at an open meeting tomorrow or next week. However, now that Japan has accepted the plan in general terms, the situation has lost its tension, and the panic that was revealed yesterday has disappeared without a trace. It is heard that the Administrative Council will advocate the establishment of a neutral zone in Manchuria when sending personnel to investigate, and that both sides will undertake to stop hostile actions and all kinds of provocative actions. In other words, it is a declaration of a ceasefire. When Briand spoke of China's attitude in the Administrative Council, he said that China would not have any unreasonable objections. He expected that China would agree to send personnel to investigate under certain guarantees. According to a telegram from Washington, if invited, the United States will definitely join the International Investigation Team. Members of the Administrative Council dined in the dining room provided by the French Foreign Ministry before dispersing. The tense atmosphere had turned into a friendly and comforting atmosphere. Everyone thought that a way to solve the difficulties had been found. The details of the committee's plan cannot be fully resolved tomorrow, so the next meeting will be held on Monday or Tuesday. However, there is no reason to worry about serious obstacles. The general impression is that the truly serious work of the League of Nations Administrative Council has now been completed. Japan's proposal to send personnel to Manchuria to investigate gives the investigation team a very large scope for investigating various elements, not only military but also political elements, such as the so-called Chinese non-compliance with treaties and the power of the Kuomintang in Chinese policy, are also under investigation. However, the dispatch of the committee may not involve Japan's troop withdrawal. This matter will still be considered by the Japanese. First of all, it depends on whether Japan is satisfied with the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents, and it also depends on whether China is willing to negotiate a treaty with Japan to resolve the various issues in dispute. The Administrative Council met at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. Chinese and Japanese representatives were not present. From the beginning, there was a more optimistic tone in the meeting. Everyone felt that sending personnel to investigate had become a consensus, but the form in which it would be submitted to China was still undecided. The Administrative Council unanimously decided that the proposal to send an investigation team to Manchuria was an appropriate way to resolve the current crisis, and decided to hold an open meeting tomorrow to hear the statements of the Chinese and Japanese representatives, and to decide on the final details. However, it is heard that there will be no major conflicts of opinion at tomorrow's meeting. The Administrative Council met for two hours and adjourned at 6:00 PM. Everyone knew that the path taken by the Administrative Council might not be free of some controversy, but in this environment, there was no better way. It is heard that the Japanese have put forward conditions for the investigation team, stating that in addition to investigating violations of treaties, the team should also investigate anti-Japanese boycotts and anti-Japanese activities in various parts of China. However, these conditions and other arrangements for the investigation team must be formulated at the open meeting. The discussion of the Administrative Council today touched on these points, and emphasized the necessity of selecting fair and important figures. With this decision made by the Administrative Council today, the October 24th resolution of the Administrative Council has almost become a mere formality, and the punitive suggestions have been swept away. People may criticize the effectiveness of the League of Nations, and condemn it for being spineless, but people in the League of Nations boast that the League of Nations' persuasion of both sides has prevented war and prevented the spread of disaster. The League of Nations Secretariat published a letter from the Japanese representative, which said, "The meaning of all kinds of annoying plans and hostile actions, the systematic destruction of various treaties and agreements signed by the two countries, and the open recognition of the desire to take back the legitimate rights</p>

<p>and interests of the Japanese, the deliberate oppression of Koreans, and the increasingly obvious and threatening hostility of the Chinese army have created a terrifying atmosphere that has led to the current situation." The above accusations will be investigated by the committee, and then a detailed report on the causes of the Sino-Japanese conflict can be released. The Japanese letter is very long, citing the statements in the notes to the Chinese Minister of Finance Song Ziwen by the Japanese ambassador to China on September 24 and October 9, and mentioning the documents sent to the League of Nations on October 12 and October 26, and concluding that the Japanese government's policy has always been consistent and has never changed its attitude. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Yoshizawa received a reply from Tokyo last night and personally delivered it to Briand at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Briand immediately informed his colleagues in the Executive Yuan, who were not very satisfied with the draft proposal, but reviewed it with the aim of calming things down. Cecil spoke three times, saying that this draft proposal must be consistent with the resolutions repeatedly passed by the Executive Yuan in the past. The Japanese government has repeatedly promised to withdraw its troops in Manchuria, which has become an obligation, and this draft proposal should not violate this obligation. The Japanese government is now using the methods proposed by the Executive Yuan in the past as its own proposal, and supports sending an investigation committee, and clearly specifying the tasks that the committee should have, but the scope of the tasks does not seem to be in line with the intentions of the League of Nations, because Japan's intention is that the committee's task is not only to monitor security issues, but also to monitor the normal relations between China and Japan and even the Chinese government's ability to respect treaties. (20th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e13">Japan Rejects Briand's Ceasefire Proposal <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Yoshizawa Admits the Principle of the Proposal</p>
<p>Japanese Government Suddenly Orders Opposition</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The reports from Paris regarding yesterday's meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council have caused concern here, as it is believed that Yoshizawa's agreement to a ceasefire in Manchuria exceeded the scope of his instructions. Japan has accepted the proposal to send an international investigation team to China and Manchuria to investigate the root causes of the Sino-Japanese conflict, but has telegraphed Yoshizawa, instructing him to reject the ceasefire. Officials claim that the ceasefire proposal implies that a state of war exists, and that a ceasefire would allow China to concentrate more than 200,000 troops in Manchuria to resist 15,000 Japanese soldiers. Therefore, Japan cannot agree to a ceasefire, lest its ability to defend itself against large numbers of Chinese soldiers and bandits be restricted. Chinese soldiers and bandits are simply indistinguishable. The instructions to Yoshizawa to reject the ceasefire were issued last night, but Yoshizawa seems to have indicated to Briand personally that he had no opposition to the proposal. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is deeply concerned that Yoshizawa assumed responsibility for admitting it without waiting for government instructions, but according to official opinion, even if Yoshizawa has admitted it, the Japanese government cannot consider itself bound by it. This is Japan's real position on the ceasefire, but at the same time, officials said that it is not impossible to agree on a ceasefire under certain conditions, and that stopping anti-Japanese work within China should be one of the conditions of the ceasefire, just like stopping military actions in Manchuria. If the term ceasefire is only interpreted as non-aggression, then Japan is very willing to agree to it, because Japan has already declared non-aggression in the League of Nations resolution of September 30. Japan feels that the League of Nations should have issued a stern warning to China one or two weeks ago when Japan asked the League of Nations to pay attention to the increasing danger of Ma Zhanshan's gathering of troops in Qiqihar and Ang'Angxi in northern Manchuria. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A month ago, Japanese newspapers and the general public all praised Yoshizawa as outstanding for his ability to handle the League of Nations single-handedly and protect Japan's position in Manchuria. Today, however, they are deeply criticizing Yoshizawa for not agreeing to an unconditional ceasefire. There is now a section of the public demanding that Matsudaira be replaced as the Japanese chief representative. General public opinion seems that Yoshizawa has not adequately informed other representatives of Japan's attitude, and believes that the ceasefire issue is not timely now, because Japan has just defeated the Qiqihar army, and now there are reports from Jinzhou that 50,000 Chinese soldiers are gathering, which is worrying. If an unconditional ceasefire is announced, it will allow the Chinese to gather their large army elsewhere, and the Japanese army will be guilty of breaking the ceasefire when it is forced to act to eliminate harm. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a certain military official here today, in the past two months, the Japanese army in Manchuria has implemented the maxim of "swift strikes and quick victories." This is the only safe way to defeat the many with the few. If the claim that Zhang Xueliang is gathering troops in Jinzhou is true, then the third test of the same principle may not be far off. It is heard that Zhang Xueliang is currently gathering more than 50,000 troops in Jinzhou, preparing to attack Xinmin and Shenyang. He intends to warn the Japanese authorities, and if Zhang ignores it, then Japan may have to take swift strike and quick victory actions again. Since there are signs of serious fighting in Jinzhou, the Japanese army in Qiqihar may have to withdraw early. The Japanese army now urgently wants to clear the harm in northern Manchuria so that it can withdraw a large number of soldiers from northern Manchuria, so that they can be used in the Jinzhou area when needed. Fortunately, the mixed brigade that Japan dispatched to replace the Manchurian garrison has arrived in Shenyang yesterday. If the brigade in Korea that is being replaced has not returned to its original defense, and there is a risk of fighting in the Jinzhou area, then the newly arrived troops in Shenyang can assist in the battle. The official concluded by saying that the Chinese authorities may be eloquent about their gathering of troops, but since the two armies are too close and the number of Japanese troops is far less than that of the Chinese, it will inevitably cause panic among the Japanese. This is why the Japanese are so worried about the League of Nations' unconditional ceasefire proposal, because they fear that China will be able to gather undisciplined large numbers of soldiers in various parts of Manchuria as a result. He believes that if war is to be prevented from recurring, the League of Nations should warn China that the gathering of troops in this state is likely to make the situation even more serious. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) A Reuters reporter learned from the highest levels that the Administrative Council did not use the term "ceasefire" at its meeting yesterday, but only used the terms "cessation of hostile acts," "cessation of provocative acts," and "neutral zone," and only used it when discussing the arrangements for both sides in the proposal to send personnel to Manchuria to investigate. The term "ceasefire" was occasionally used in the informal meeting a few days ago, but was immediately rejected because its meaning was confusing. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) Today, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson again secretly consulted with Under Secretary of State Castle, Far Eastern Affairs Director Hornbeck, and others regarding the Manchurian incident. The content was kept absolutely secret. It is said that the reason for maintaining such secrecy is partly due to the increasing number of Americans opposed to the U.S. participating in the League of Nations' peace efforts. Today, after officials in the State Department expressed their satisfaction with the news that China and Japan had accepted the principle of a truce, they suddenly received a telegram from Tokyo stating that the Japanese government rejected the proposal. The Chinese embassy also stated that a truce would be of little value as long as all of Manchuria was under Japanese control. (20th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Borah stated today that the United States has no other option regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute in Manchuria than to mediate and maintain peace. No peace-loving nation or nation that respects treaties would want to take action other than mediation. Therefore, the idea of the United States using armed intervention seems unbelievable.

<h3 id="e15">Covenant or Scrap Paper? <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Since the third session of the League of Nations Council, many secret agreements have been made without any public discussion. While diplomats from various countries are secretly plotting, the Japanese army is cruelly bombarding and seizing Qiqihar with aircraft and heavy artillery. The songs of peace broadcast from Paris cannot possibly drown out the loud sounds of Japanese heavy artillery bombarding our Northeast. The principles of justice and righteousness proclaimed by diplomats from various countries cannot stop the Japanese army's mad atrocities in our Northeast. Why the League of Nations is meeting is truly perplexing to people all over the world.</p>
<p>According to a Paris dispatch on the 19th, Yoshizawa submitted a memorandum from Briand to the League of Nations, preventing an international investigation team from going to the Northeast to investigate. He also stated that Japan would not withdraw its troops unless China directly negotiates with Japan and recognizes Japan's treaty rights. A dispatch on the 20th stated that Japan had agreed to the League of Nations sending an investigation commission, but the members must be approved by Japan, and the scope of the investigation must be pre-determined to include not only issues of security but also the normal relations between China and Japan and whether the Chinese government has the ability to respect treaties. Thus, the dispatch of this investigation commission will not investigate the atrocities of the Japanese side, nor will it investigate the various facts of the Manchurian Incident, but will directly investigate the situation of the entire China for Japan. Moreover, not only is Japan unwilling to withdraw its troops, but it also straightforwardly states its unwillingness to have a truce. This kind of barbarous and unreasonable behavior has reached its extreme. We dare to assert that Japan has resolved to destroy peace and fundamentally deal a fatal blow to the League of Nations' credibility, making it unable to continue to maintain its existence. In other words, it is nothing less than declaring war on the whole world and all of humanity.</p>
<p>From September 18th to this day, more than two months have passed. Japan's conspiracy and ambition have long been deeply considered and well-calculated. Our country, out of respect for the League of Nations' prestige, has repeatedly made concessions, while the League of Nations has repeatedly delayed, without taking any concrete and effective measures. First, there was the recommendation that the Japanese army withdraw as soon as possible before October 13th. The second meeting had a resolution of thirteen votes to one on November 16th. However, after the League of Nations' first recommendation, the Japanese army's atrocities only intensified, resulting in the loss of Jinzhou after one urging and the Tianjin incident after the second resolution. Now, as the League of Nations is holding its third meeting, there is also the occupation of Qiqihar. Half of our Northeast's territory has fallen into the hands of the Japanese. The credibility of the League of Nations has also suffered a major blow. It cannot be said that this is not due to our country's excessive trust in the League of Nations and the League of Nations' perfunctory delays. According to foreign dispatches, when representatives of various countries heard the Japanese representative's statement on the 19th that Japan would not withdraw its troops, they all looked at each other in dismay. We do not know how the representatives will react today when they hear the news that Japan has rejected Briand's truce recommendation.</p>
<p>The League of Nations, which was formed to maintain world peace, in this situation, will it continue to be perfunctory and complacent, watching the Japanese atrocities expand, willingly allowing its credibility to be swept away, and allowing the covenant to disintegrate? Or will it further support the strong and suppress the weak, fueling the Japanese ferocity, and plunge all of humanity into a tragic situation of terror? If not, then the only option is to take decisive action and impose just and effective sanctions on the tyrannical Japan. The application of Article 16 of the League Covenant should not be delayed even for a moment. The matter today can be resolved in one sentence: If the League of Nations has the determination to maintain world peace, then please show it through practical action. If it does not have this determination, then please withdraw and declare the bankruptcy of justice and the despair of peace, so that countries can prepare themselves to cope with the imminent slaughter. If it continues to delay and does not engage in open discussions, the more secrets there are, the greater the crisis will be. However, if, for the sake of seeking a quick solution, it suppresses strong Japan and instead oppresses China, forcing China to accept the demand for investigation before withdrawal, then the League of Nations will abandon its own covenant first. Not only will the League of Nations collapse immediately and the League of Nations Covenant become a paper tiger, but the resulting disaster will be unimaginable. Are the representatives somewhat aware of this? The situation today has reached its final moment. Does the League of Nations Covenant have absolute dignity, or is it indeed a piece of scrap paper that deceives the weak? The final answer will be revealed at this time.</p>

<p>Content Not Announced</p>
<p>(Tokyo) U.S. Secretary of State Stimson met with Japanese Foreign Minister Shidehara last night, and Shidehara immediately responded. Officials refused to announce the content, but the Jiji Shimpo learned that Stimson specifically asked Japan to pay attention to its obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact due to the Japanese army's occupation of Qiqihar.

<h3 id="e17">Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Note to the Japanese Government <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Protesting the Japanese Army's Occupation of Heihe</p>
<p>Urging Negotiation of Troop Withdrawal Details</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent the following note to Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu on the 21st, and through Chinese Ambassador to Japan Chiang to the Japanese government:</p>
<p>(1) According to the resolution of the League of Nations Council on September 30th and the resolution unanimously passed by the 13 member states of the Council on October 24th, the governments of China and Japan are each responsible for avoiding policies of aggression and expanding the situation. The October 24th resolution has already been formally directed by the Chairman of the Council and has full moral force. The note also specifically mentions items 5 and 6 of the October 30th resolution. The Japanese government is also well aware of its obligations under the Council's resolution. However, from October 30th to this day, the troops under the jurisdiction of the Japanese government have been constantly expanding their military operations within Chinese territory and engaging in actions not permitted even in wartime under international law. For example, the bombing of Jinzhou by aircraft on October 23rd shocked various countries. Recently, the situation has become even worse, to the point of extorting Chinese national tax revenue, colluding with bandits, supplying them with firearms, and instigating disturbances. The authorities of the Japanese concession in Tianjin are using their concession status to allow large groups of armed plainclothes teams to assemble and depart, attacking government agencies and killing and injuring civil servants and civilians. On the one hand, under the pretext of repairing the Nenjiang Bridge, which they have no right to repair, they are advancing troops into Heilongjiang Province, attacking Chinese troops, and coercing the provincial government authorities. China has repeatedly lodged serious protests and pointed out the Japanese government's major responsibility. According to recent reports, the Japanese army has captured Angangxi and Qiqihar on the 18th and 19th of this month, and first dropped bombs and leaflets in Qiqihar, declaring its firm intention to capture the capital of Heilongjiang Province. This is a clear violation of the aforementioned Council resolution. If all the above-mentioned acts of armed aggression are the Japanese government's established policy, then the Japanese government's enthusiastic participation in the League of Nations Council's October 30th resolution is incomprehensible.</p>
<p>(2) The Japanese government does not first reflect on its own faults but instead claims that the natural and passive expressions of emotion of the Chinese people are a violation of the Council resolution, which the Chinese government cannot accept. The Chinese people are in a state of extreme indignation under the active aggression of Japan. However, the attitude they have taken toward Japanese residents is only automatically biased toward commercial relations, and there is no deliberate harm to life or property. Moreover, the Chinese government, except in areas occupied by the Japanese army, is making every effort to protect Japanese residents and acting fairly. Objective third parties find it strange that the Chinese government and people have consistently adhered to the non-war pact and other international conventions and dealt with Japan's tyranny within the scope of the law. The Japanese government has failed to realize the folly of its various acts of aggression and, under the serious circumstances of Japanese military occupation and coercion, it strongly desires the Chinese people to restore their normal friendship. This is truly putting the cart before the horse. The Chinese government must also point out to the Japanese government that as long as the Japanese troops occupying various parts of China do not withdraw, the situation is not restored to its original state, and the aggression does not stop, then the Chinese people's feelings toward the Japanese people cannot be restored. This should be understood by the Japanese government.</p>
<p>(3) Under international law, international covenants, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and under the League of Nations Council's resolution of September 30th and the resolution of October 24th with full moral force, the Japanese government should have completed the withdrawal of troops at the same time. There is no room for further debate. The Chinese government now asks the Japanese government to examine its repeated letters and the League of Nations Council Chairman's reply to the Japanese government on November 1st, to quickly change its past policies, and to negotiate the details of withdrawal and acceptance with the receiving committee already appointed by China, so that the troops currently occupying various parts of the Northeast can withdraw completely immediately, and the peace in East Asia that has been destroyed can have a turning point as a result.

<h3 id="e18">Soviet Russia's Reply to Japan <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Deeply Concerned About Damage to Interests in the Eastern Route</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov sent a reply tonight to Japanese Ambassador Hirota, expressing satisfaction in the text that the fighting in the Qiqihar area had not damaged the Chinese Eastern Railway. At the same time, he asked Hirota to note that the Japanese government had previously limited the area of the Manchurian war to the greatest extent possible, but now it has exceeded the original boundaries. This matter is sufficient to increase the possibility of damaging Soviet Russian interests. The Soviet government cannot help but be deeply concerned. Yesterday, the Japanese note to Soviet Russia was announced here. At the same time, Litvinov's reply was also announced. The Japanese note declared that the Japanese government absolutely did not want to hinder the Chinese Eastern Railway. If the fighting in the Qiqihar area expands, then the responsibility clearly lies with China. However, the Chinese Eastern Railway cannot escape responsibility for the expansion of the war in northern Manchuria. Litvinov's reply stated that recently, Japanese officials, apparently without government permission, have arbitrarily made irresponsible declarations, accusing Soviet Russia of assisting the Chinese army and interfering in the Sino-Japanese war in Manchuria. Fortunately, the Japanese government has clearly seen through this and has not lightly believed it, which he is very pleased with. Litvinov also denied the claim that the current situation is similar to the Sino-Soviet war of 1929, saying that in 1929, the Soviet army only defended against the Chinese army's attack, and at that time, the Soviet army did not temporarily occupy Chinese territory or expel local officials and replace them with new ones. The Soviet Russian government did not use its military superiority to take advantage of China's weakness. He also said that the Chinese Eastern Railway is now protected by the Chinese army, and Soviet Russia has abandoned its right to station troops along the line. It has now ordered the Chinese army and Chinese and Russian personnel on the road to strictly maintain neutrality in this Sino-Japanese war. The end of the note reiterated Soviet Russia's peaceful policy and hoped that Japan would pay attention to the inviolability of Soviet Russian interests. Tonight, it was also announced here that on November 19th, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a representative to the Russian embassy in Tokyo to explain the reason why the Japanese army's advance on Qiqihar had to cross the Chinese Eastern Railway, and stated that the current battle had not damaged the Chinese Eastern Railway. Once security is restored, the Japanese army intends to withdraw from Qiqihar. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Moscow telegram: Litvinov's reply to Japanese Ambassador Hirota roughly stated: "Your Excellency's declaration that the Sino-Japanese incident is similar to the Sino-Soviet incident of 1929 is a great mistake. In 1929, although the Chinese authorities trampled on Soviet rights under the Sino-Soviet treaties, the Soviet side did not occupy Manchuria, nor did it temporarily occupy it. At that time, there was no Soviet army occupying Chinese territory, nor was there any overthrow of the current authorities and the appointment of new authorities, nor was there any disturbance to Japanese rights. After the matter was over, the Soviet army withdrew to Soviet territory and never imposed new conditions because of the weakness of the Chinese army or attempted to resolve issues that had no direct relationship with the cause of the matter by force. For example, in 1929, the South Manchuria Railway refused to transport Chinese troops. Now, the Chinese Eastern Railway has transported Chinese troops. The South Manchuria Railway is managed and operated by Japan, while the Chinese Eastern Railway is jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union. The situations of the two railways are fundamentally different. The Soviet Union has always maintained a neutral attitude. The Japanese government has stated that it will not infringe on Soviet interests or damage the Chinese Eastern Railway, but the expansion of the Japanese army's actions in Manchuria, which increases the possibility of endangering the Soviet side, has aroused serious concern from the Soviet government." (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, represented by Nagai, sent a note to the Russian ambassador in Tokyo on Thursday, explaining the reason why the Japanese army was forced to cross the Chinese Eastern Railway. Nagai, representing the Japanese government, claimed that the Japanese army commander instructed the forward troops not to damage the Chinese Eastern Railway. After the newly appointed Chinese guard commander arrives in Qiqihar and restores order, the Japanese army will withdraw from Heihe and retreat south. However, the exact date of withdrawal cannot be determined. However, according to Nagai's intention, the troops may be withdrawn within four or five days. Nagai also reiterated Japan's friendly attitude towards Soviet Russia and repeatedly stated that it would not damage the Chinese Eastern Railway. Japanese Ambassador to Russia Hirota also stated everything in the same vein when he visited Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to Riga news, there are indications of disagreement in Soviet Russian political circles due to the Manchurian incident. Various Soviet institutions in Moscow are now holding meetings to protest Japanese imperialism. It is said that this movement is intended to create public opinion in order to adopt a more resolute plan deliberated by the Russian government in the Far East. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side sent a Chinese named Zhao Yaowu and more than 30 Japanese soldiers to recruit five to six hundred bandits at the junction of the eighth district of Xinmin and Faku County to attack the Faku County seat. The county authorities have increased their defenses. In addition, in the areas of Faku bordering Shenyang and Tieling, there are also Japanese soldiers recruiting more than 800 bandits to cross the river and attack Faku. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Released After Presenting British Passport</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Well-informed foreigners recently revealed the situation of the world-renowned epidemic prevention expert Dr. Wu Lien-teh being maltreated by the Japanese. Wu recently went to Changchun for epidemic prevention affairs and was detained by the Japanese military authorities. He was escorted to Shenyang by Japanese soldiers and imprisoned in the residence of a certain military officer, where he was interrogated severely all day long, accusing him of being an investigator sent by the Nanjing government to investigate the Japanese army's seizure of salt tax and customs duties. At six o'clock that evening, he was dragged downstairs and locked in a damp small room without even a bed. Wu remained there for 48 hours without seeing the sunlight and was in extreme distress. He then presented his British passport (Wu was born in Singapore) and requested his release. Thereupon, the Japanese immediately released Wu and apologized, saying that if they had known earlier that he was British, they would not have detained him. Wu was released on the evening of November 18th. The Japanese authorities gave him a pass so that he could pass through the Japanese military lines without being obstructed. Wu is currently en route to Nanjing. Due to the interference of the Japanese military authorities, Wu was unable to go to the two Manchurian epidemic prevention centers to handle important epidemic prevention work.

From noon to 4:00 p.m., the south entrance of Asahi Street was opened to traffic with the French concession, allowing people to enter and exit. After 4:00 p.m., those without passes from the Japanese police station were not allowed to enter or exit. The goods of the Zhongyuan Company have been moved to the French concession.

<p>Rome: The "Oser" newspaper made lengthy comments on the Far Eastern situation, stating: "The League of Nations and the public opinion of the United States, France, and Britain are now changing direction and succumbing to Japan's policy of force. The League of Nations has become a laughingstock because of the Manchurian incident. If the Chinese surrender because of the Japanese army's victory, then the policy of nationalism will be overturned, and the demand for international equality will lose its meaning. What is to be feared is that if China is horizontally oppressed, it will easily generate resentment and embark on the path of declaring war. Although China has no chance of winning, after defeat, a world war will follow, the magnitude of its impact is beyond anyone's expectations." (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Lanzhou) Sichuan and Gansu generals Ma Lin, Jin Shuren, Ma Hongkui, Liu Cunhou, Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, Huang Yin, Lei Zhongtian, Ma Wenche, Pan Zhenyun, Ma Bufang, Lu Dachang, Ma Tingxian, Wang Jiazeng, Gao Zhenbang, and Li Guiqing issued a joint telegram from Lanzhou stating: (Titles Omitted) Japanese power is invading and aggressing, our ancestral enemy. Since the Sino-Japanese War, they have gained an inch and wanted a mile, ceding land, plundering benefits, and insatiable greed. Recently, they have become even more tyrannical and cruel, occupying the three northeastern provinces, imposing oppression, and doing whatever they want. They are about to destroy our country and exterminate our nation. All citizens should strengthen their hearts for the five races (Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan) to live in harmony and unite the power of our four hundred million compatriots to help each other, abandon private grievances, uphold public loyalty, unite in spirit, and unanimously face the outside world. Fortunately, Ning and Guangdong are jointly seeking unification and deliberating on national affairs, and there are good plans. However, common hatred against the enemy depends on our fellow soldiers. We believe that General Wu Ziyu, a national elder, has been living in seclusion in Sichuan for several years. Although his body is resting in the mountains and rivers, his heart is always concerned about the country. At this time of foreign aggression and crisis, he has suddenly arrived in Long. Xie An is not old, and we all admire Dongshan. Moreover, he previously defended Liaodong and happened to encounter the Russo-Japanese War. He observed the situation in Manchuria and the Japanese military situation without omission and understood them like the back of his hand. We earnestly request the central government and the fellow soldiers and people across the country to unanimously urge him to come out of the mountains, preside over foreign military affairs, be the government's diplomatic backing, and be the people's vanguard for saving the country. Lin et al. are determined to defend the country and are willing to go to the battlefield, wrapped in horse hide upon death, glorious even in death. If the country is about to perish, dare we have other intentions? We earnestly state our words, hoping you will consider them. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Havas Agency, Paris, 20th - The Chamber of Deputies continues to discuss the questioning of foreign policy issues. There are very few members present, and the atmosphere in the chamber is very quiet. Radical Party member Luo Jialuo believes that France's financial situation is not as good as people say. The cash imported into France is only temporarily stored and will soon be exported. He also believes that the French government should propose to the disarmament conference that aviation and military industries should be placed under international joint management and should require the manufacture and sale of military equipment to be monitored. Luo mentioned the situation in Germany, saying that the strength of the National Socialist Party is gradually expanding, but the Social Democratic Party is still the strongest political party. The party is well aware of the danger of the National Socialist Party. All French people who hope for French-German cooperation should wholeheartedly protect peace for the Social Democratic Party and deeply sympathize with its resistance to the recklessness of the extreme parties on the left and right wings. When Luo spoke, the majority of the seats applauded enthusiastically, especially Prime Minister Laval and the ministers of state.</p>

<p>Traffic Will Be Cut Off After 8:00 PM at Night</p>
<p>The Whole City is Filled With a Desolate and Bleak Atmosphere</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: After the Tianjin Incident occurred, Beiping and Tianjin were separated by only a small distance, and rumors also arose accordingly. The military and police authorities, in order to prevent unforeseen circumstances, had to take serious precautions. Although martial law was not formally declared, the state of alert was actually stricter than in the past. Every day after 8:00 PM, traffic in the whole city was cut off. Constitution police stood guard in all important streets and intersections, questioning and investigating passers-by, refusing to let them pass. All shops closed their doors one after another around 7:30 PM. Rickshaws could not be found anywhere after 8:00 PM. The gates of the outer city were closed early at 7:00 PM and opened at 6:00 AM the next morning. Everything was filled with a desolate and bleak atmosphere. Today, the north wind suddenly rose, and the weather turned cold. The sound of the howling wind added to the misery. Because after the alert, this reporter did not know what the situation was like in the city at night, so in the biting north wind, I went to the important streets and markets to take a look at the situation. At 7:20 PM (afternoon), I started from the north entrance of North Xinhua Street at the Central Cinema. There was a row of Big Knife Team soldiers from the Second District, about twelve people, assisting four patrol police officers from the Ninth Section, each carrying a large gun, patrolling back and forth on the road. At that time, the cold wind was piercing and as sharp as a knife on the face. There was no one on the road. All police posts passed along the way were guarded by two police officers standing in double posts, patrolling with guns. When I reached the outside of the Xiwachang entrance inside Hepingmen, I saw a row of security team members in the distance, about twenty people, with a red glass lamp placed on the ground, shining brightly. When the police officers saw someone coming, they shouted "Go back" from a distance. After explaining the reason and persuading them repeatedly, they finally agreed to let me pass. When I arrived at Hepingmen, there were eight police officers guarding it. The iron gate on the eastern side of the gate hole had been closed, and the western iron gate was also partially closed. The police officers firmly refused to let me out of the city, saying that martial law was being imposed early at 6:00 PM this evening and that it was now past 8:00, so no one could pass. The reporter had to explain painstakingly again and again before being allowed to rush out of the city. Passing through the middle of the Glass Factory, the police officers patrolling back and forth were numerous, and fortunately, there was no trouble after interrogation. Then, passing through the Stone Hutong in Hanjiatan, the so-called "Eight Ports" area, which used to be brightly lit, with pipa lanes and bustling traffic, was now desolate and deserted, with few people. Only a single light in front of each small squad was like a bean, decorating the "dead street". The interrogation by the police officers at the posts there was even stricter. Passing through Xizhushikou to Tianqiao, there were police officers standing guard all along the way, and many sandbags were piled up on the side of the road. The former bustling streets of Qianmen Dajie, Shijia Hutong, Dapenglan, and Xianyukou, etc., were now quiet and deserted, with only sandbags and patrolling police officers at the entrances of the alleys. Entering the east gate hole of Zhengyangmen, passing through Dongjiaomin Lane to Chongwenmen Dajie, the deployment of posts by security teams, big knife teams, and bicycle teams, etc., was even stricter. However, what was strange was that Dongjiaomin Lane, within the boundary of the Concession, was still open to traffic, and at the Six Nations Hotel, the sound of the piano was melodious, and the modern men and women were singing and dancing heartily. There were even more foreigners coming and going. Compared with the protected areas outside the boundary, it was truly like a paradise. From Chongwenmen to Dongdan Archway, along Dongchang'an Street, Tiananmen, Xichang'an Street, to Xidan Archway, the security along the way was extremely strict. The crescent moon in the treetops made people feel even more desolate. The Public Security Bureau's bicycle team and the Security Cavalry patrolled back and forth without stopping. Because it was already 10:00 when I got north of Xidan, the police officers firmly refused to let me go, so I had to give up and return. From what this reporter observed, although the security in the south city was strict, the east city was even tighter than the south city. The west city was slightly relaxed south of Xidan, but north of Xidan, such as the area near Shunchengwang Mansion, was also extremely tight. However, among the whole city, those responsible for the security, apart from the police, were all military police, and there was not a single soldier. This was different from previous martial law situations. In addition, hotels and public buildings were all closed at 6:00 PM, and the names of the guests were re-registered in the guest register for inspection.</p>
<p>More orderlies were assigned to duty. In addition to sending gold jewelry to the vault for safekeeping, valuable furs and clothes were also deposited elsewhere. The large restaurants were deserted, and the theaters and cinemas only put on matinee shows. All women's academies and ping academies posted advertisements in front of their doors saying "Business as usual during the day" and "The lamp show will be held on another day." Barbershops and bathhouses drove out customers at 6:00 PM. After 8:00 PM, in the middle of each road, in addition to the armed police officers, there was only the streetlights reflecting the wind and the sound of roaring. (Evening of the 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Establishment of the Pseudo Transportation Committee in Shenyang <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping states that when the Japanese army initially occupied Liaoning and Jilin, the Japanese government advocated using military force to compel us to resolve various outstanding issues. For example, the preparation to reorganize the local maintenance association into a provincial government was a scheme to establish an entity for negotiation that could be directed and manipulated. Regarding railways, the president of the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu), Uchida, and Shigeru Honjo held discussions and, as a result, urged us to restore the Northeast Transportation Committee and resume operations as before, with the condition that Japanese advisors be added. We politely declined, stating that the committee had already moved to Beiping and would be dealt with like other agencies after your country withdrew its troops. The Japanese, seeing no progress, incited Jianxiu Ding and others to organize a separate committee to serve as a counterpart for signing various railway treaties. Ding and his ilk, devoid of conscience, only followed orders. They convened Jin Bi-dong, Duo Kan, and others to discuss the organizational charter and the date of establishment. It was decided to transfer over one million yuan in savings from the committee's accounts in various banks in Shenyang. Simultaneously, Chinese documents and valuables were moved to the Tongze Club, located opposite the old imperial palace. On the first of this month, under the supervision of the Japanese army, they held the so-called establishment ceremony, mutually electing Xiangjian Xiu as chairman and Bi-dong Jin as vice-chairman. The chairman's advisor was originally intended to be Sogawa, a director of Mantetsu, but later changed to Yoshikan Er Usa. They also recruited former staff members, promising generous salaries. It is said that a few staff members went to report for duty, only to find the club heavily guarded. Upon inquiring, they learned that the committee, due to the limited space, had moved to the Sun Gong Ancestral Hall at the eastern end of Jiuwei Road and would only officially begin operations after a reorganization meeting on the fifteenth of this month. Disappointed, they returned. When they reported to the temporary office in Beiping, the deadline of the fifth of this month had already passed. They found themselves in limbo, with nowhere to turn. This serves as a cautionary tale for those who seek to profit from opportunism. The articles of association of the pseudo-Transportation Committee in Shenyang are recorded below: (1) The purpose of this committee is to manage transportation administration matters, in accordance with the original mission of transportation agencies, to improve and connect transportation, enhance convenience for passengers and freight, and increase the benefits of transportation agencies. (2) This committee is a committee-based system composed of representatives from various railways. (Shenhai Railway, Jihai Railway, Jichang Railway, Jitun Railway, Tiantu Railway, Huhai Railway, Qike Railway, Taoang Railway, Taosuo Railway, Sitao Railway) (3) This committee will be located in Fengtian and will have the following staff: one chairman, one vice-chairman, one chairman advisor, and several advisors, counselors, and secretaries. (A) The chairman and vice-chairman shall be elected by the various committee members. However, it is permissible to elect individuals who are not committee members. (B) The chairman advisor, advisors, and counselors shall be selected by the chairman, who will recommend leaders of administrative agencies and organizations related to transportation, as well as individuals skilled in transportation operations. (C) The appointment and dismissal of the chairman advisor must be approved by the committee. (4) The chairman will oversee the affairs of the committee and rule on the proceedings of the committee. (5) The vice-chairman will assist the chairman. In the event of an accident involving the chairman, the vice-chairman will act on his behalf. (6) Advisors will attend committee meetings and provide advice when consulted, or actively express opinions. (7) The chairman advisor will assist the chairman and vice-chairman and manage affairs. (8) Counselors will assist officers and manage committee affairs. (9) This committee will manage administrative matters related to roads, postal services, telephone, telegraph, aviation, rivers, and automobiles, as necessary. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Pu Yi Intends to Take the Stage as a Puppet <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>But Pu Wei's covert competition is fierce</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping states that Pu Yi's plot to usurp the throne has been brewing for a long time. Half a month ago, Beijing sent supervisor Gao Jizong to Tianjin, intending to advise Pu. Because Gao was a Manchu and had previously served in the Ministry of Education during the Qing Dynasty, it was easier for him to offer advice. However, Pu had been planning this for a long time, so Gao returned without success. Simultaneously, Doihara and Jin Liang arrived in Tianjin one after another, inciting him. Zheng Xiaoxu especially advocated for it. Although Chen Baochen and others advocated for stability and did not want their former master to become a Japanese puppet, they saw that Pu's mind was made up and did not dare to openly oppose him. On the evening of the eighth, the Tianjin Incident occurred. On the tenth, Doihara abducted Pu Yi, accompanied only by Zheng Xiaoxu and Zheng's eldest son, Zheng Chui. Zheng Chui was a graduate of Waseda University and had served as Pu's Japanese translator for many years, earning Pu's trust. Rumors that Zheng's second son, Zheng Yu, accompanied them are not accurate. In addition, no other close relatives were informed. Even Pu's wife remained in Tianjin and did not accompany him. After Pu arrived in Shenyang on the fourteenth, the puppet regime was originally scheduled to take the stage on the fifteenth. However, Pu Wei suddenly began vigorous activities, seeking to fulfill his imperial dreams. Because Pu Wei had fled to Qingdao during the Xinhai Revolution, and later traveled east to Japan, he had received Japanese funding for twenty years, leading a dissolute life and befriending many Japanese rōnin. Therefore, in this bizarre drama of restoration actively orchestrated by Japan, many Japanese military men and pro-Japanese factions in the Northeast also supported Pu Wei. In this environment, Pu Wei increasingly felt that it was possible for him to become emperor and intensified his efforts, increasing his plans to exclude Pu Yi. Pu Yi found himself in a dilemma, feeling threatened and apprehensive. However, the Japanese authorities believed that it would be easier to rally support with Pu Yi as emperor, and would not support Pu Wei unless absolutely necessary. They are currently in the process of resolving this situation. Therefore, although Pu Wei is engaged in various maneuvers, he will probably only be a substitute emperor and will not be able to fill the position immediately. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Establishment of the Jinan Garrison Command <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Lei Taiping Appointed Commander</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, Han Fuju, believing that the current diplomatic tension might cause small people to be incited and take the opportunity to create chaos, has strictly enforced security in Jinan and along the Jiaoji Railway. He also requested that Qingdao Mayor Hu Ruoyu, Jiaoji Railway Committee Chairman Ge Guangting, and Yantai 21st Division Commander Liu Zhennian cooperate to prevent disturbances along the coast. Jinan, being the location of the provincial capital and a hub for Chinese and foreigners, is particularly important. Since the evening before last (17th), security has been tightened. Entertainment venues close early every night, and the streets are cleared starting at 12:00 AM. Pedestrians must answer a password to pass through, and those who appear suspicious are detained. This morning (19th), Han specifically appointed Lei Taiping, commander of the pistol brigade, as the Jinan Garrison Commander. He will be responsible for maintaining Jinan's security, along with Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie and Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Kairu. After receiving the appointment, Lei immediately held a meeting at the municipal government. Wen Chenglie, Wang Kairu, Municipal Government Secretary-General Wang Naigou, and others attended. It was decided that the headquarters would be located inside the municipal government. Lei also decided to issue a notice tomorrow (20th) to assume office. The organization of the headquarters will likely consist of a chief of staff under the commander, with Zhao Danpo, the chief of staff of the pistol brigade, serving in that role. The office will be divided into sections for staff, secretary, adjutant, documents, accounting, general affairs, communication, law enforcement, printing, telecommunications, clerks, recorders, messengers, and soldiers. Personnel have also been assigned. It is currently being submitted to the provincial government for approval. The entire pistol brigade, comprising over 4,000 men, is stationed in Jinan, distributed throughout the city and commercial areas. The first battalion of the first regiment is stationed at the provincial government, the second battalion at Nanying, the third battalion at the Civil Affairs Department, the special operations battalion from the West Gate to the Puli Gate, and the transportation battalion west of Weijiu Road. The first battalion of the second regiment is stationed at both ammunition depots, the second battalion at the Jinpu and Jiaoji railway stations and headquarters, and the third battalion patrols the streets. In addition, law enforcement teams and detective teams have been organized, with all of them performing duties. The deployment is exceptionally thorough, and Jinan's security should be assured.

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3 id="e70">Honjo Shigeru Suggests to Southern Army Minister To Seize Manchuria and Mongolia On The Opportunity <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Taking advantage of the economic depression in Europe and America and China's disunity</p>
<p>Seizing a continental base to counter Soviet Russia in the East and threaten America in the West</p>
<p>Japan's intention to invade, its specific plan, has already been seen in the Tanaka Memorial. We now know that on August 3 of this year, Honjo Shigeru, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, wrote to Southern Jiro, the Japanese Minister of the Army, suggesting taking the opportunity to seize Manchuria and Mongolia and threaten the United States. His ambition is even more blatant. It is urgent to translate and record as follows. Reading it, one can know the origin of Japan's reckless invasion of our Northeast.</p>
<p>"To His Excellency Southern Jiro, Minister of the Army, Honjo observes the existence of the empire, and to enrich the status of a first-class country, it is necessary to take the opportunity of the world's financial decline, Russia's unfulfilled five-year plan, and China's unfulfilled unification, to truly occupy Manchuria and Mongolia, which we have been operating for thirty years, and to achieve the purpose of sending troops to Siberia in the eighth year of Taisho, so that the above areas can be integrated with our Korea and the interior, so that the foundation of our empire can be consolidated in the present world. Honjo Shigeru respectfully presents his detailed investigation. The revival of China, the existence of Red Russia, and the American Eastward invasion of the Pacific are all fundamentally incompatible with the basic national policies of our empire. However, in order to prevent the American Eastward invasion, we must first enrich the consolidation of the empire's land defense and the independence of materials. Therefore, before the war with the United States, we must first make the empire's military power occupy a superior position in Russia and China, so that Russia and China will be unable to recover. Even if we cannot completely destroy their power, we can also prevent them from attacking us or having the opportunity to revive in a shorter period of time. Then our empire can obtain a vast and wealthy source of newly occupied land, and use it to enrich the empire's naval defense, to contain American power east of Hawaii, and when the time comes, the Philippines will be managed by us without any problem. Therefore, we can monopolize the western Pacific without anyone being able to compete with us. With American power gone east, British power is in Singapore, and Hong Kong is not enough to worry about us, and will soon be wiped out by our navy, and the South China Sea will also be under our control. In this way, China's four hundred states will be in our grasp, and the unification of all of Asia and the conquest of Europe will not be difficult to achieve. Let's discuss the order of its progress. The first step should be to occupy Manchuria and Mongolia in China and become the country of Manchuria and Mongolia. The second step should be to use the East Qing Railway to attack Siberia and occupy Upper Usk, forcing Red Russia to cede the land east of the Lena River to the Bering Strait to us, and we will assist the White Russians or Buryats to become an independent country in the Far East. Then these two independent countries (referring to Manchuria and Mongolia and the Far East) should be managed by our supervisors. In this way, the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan are completely owned by us, and the empire's maritime defense is only on the southeast side. If the above-mentioned territories are under our jurisdiction, their rich reserves will make our empire a first-class country of Jin Tang. Manchuria and Mongolia in China are the three provinces of Fengtian, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, and the easternmost part of Inner and Outer Mongolia, with an area of approximately 740,000 square miles, three times larger than our interior. The land east of the Russian Lena River, namely the post-Baikal region, Yakutsk region, Amur region, coastal region, and North Sakhalin Island, has an area of approximately 300,000 square miles, more than seven times larger than our interior. The total population of the two places is less than 40 million, only half of our total population (including Korea and Taiwan). With such a vast land and only so many people, our empire can use it, and there is no need to worry about the population having no place to consume within two hundred years. Moreover, its agricultural, mining, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery are so rich that it is impossible to calculate. And its long rivers and huge lakes are even more valuable. Its water power can supply the entire land for power generation, and the Songhua River Plain, Nenjiang River Plain, Liaohe River Plain, and Heilongjiang River coast are all extremely fertile land. With the empire's technology, 30-40% of its agricultural products can make up for the empire's current shortage, and more than 80% can be used for the world market. As for the fisheries in the Sea of Okhotsk, it is one of the three major fish producing areas in the world. With the empire's efforts to develop it, it can obtain more than 10,000 million yuan in benefits every year, and the benefits of whaling are even greater. The horses in Chita and Rehe, and the cattle hides and wool in various places are infinite. We can do without foreign imports of wool woven materials. Petroleum mines have been found in 50 places, and their content is equal to that of Baku and Pennsylvania, so the problem of fuel for our country, as well as the oil for industrial, naval, and aviation purposes, is solved forever. There is a huge amount of gold, and Russia and China have already excavated eight places. At this time of gold shortage, if our empire can make every effort to excavate it, the increase in national wealth can be increased a hundredfold. Coal and iron are self-evident. Compared with the poor situation in our country, it is really like the difference between heaven and earth. If we use it, the future of industry can be limited. The richness of forests can be compared to Canada. If our paper industry uses it, it can run rampant in the world market. If the above-mentioned areas are under our management, within ten years, our empire's wealth can exceed that of the United States. At that time, what country in the world can compete with our empire? With this financial power and this material power, even if we train twice as many land troops as Russia and China, and a navy equal to that of the United Kingdom and the United States, there is no difficulty at all. Then it is not difficult for us to drive the United States east of Hawaii, screen the United Kingdom west of Singapore, and grasp the full hegemony of the western Pacific. The Dutch East Indies, as well as the British territories of Australia and New Zealand, are all in the hands of our empire. Based on this situation, we can advance to conquer the entire territory of China, as well as all of Asia, and then conquer all of Europe and Africa, and grasp the land of the eastern hemisphere, to share the world equally with the United States. This is the legacy of our Emperor Meiji, and the responsibility that our Yamato nation should have. At this time, Russia and China are still in the preparation stage of revival, and their strength is weak. If we meet them with a strong land army, it will be like destroying withered and rotten things. If we miss this opportunity and do not plan, and sit and wait for China's unification to be completed, Chiang Kai-shek's ambition to revive China will be achieved, and the Red Russia's five-year plan will be completed, not only will the hopes for the empire's future become a bubble, but the empire's great disaster will be imminent. I hereby submit the findings of the investigation and detailed illustrations for your attention. (Illustrations omitted)</p>

<p>Jin Yudong Handles Affairs According to Japanese Intentions</p>
<p>A dispatch from Harbin states that after Xi Qia, under the command of the Japanese, appointed Jin Yudong, a mixed-race person, as the director of the Jichang and Jidun Railways, all section chiefs and section heads above the level in the bureau were replaced by Japanese. Jin also considered himself a Japanese, so the policy direction did not await Xi Qia's instructions, but directly consulted Mantetsu. The Jidun and Jichang Railways were not connected, but after the Japanese forcibly connected the Jihai Railway, the Jidun and Jichang Railways also implemented the connection on the 14th of this month. Jin's request to Xi Qia was for reducing expenses and making management easier. The Japanese had already agreed to it in advance, and Xi Qia naturally did not dare to reject it afterwards. As a result, the three Jilin railways (Jichang, Jihai, Jidun) have completed a line. Jin also recruited scattered soldiers and defeated Yong to form a railway protection security team with 7,000 people, and concurrently served as commander.

<p>The Fourteenth District Opposes Changing County Jurisdiction Fengxian County proposed that Caojing, Huan'an, Que, Hujiaqiao, Zhalin, and other places east of the Yepu Pond in Punan, and north of the Longquan Port, be placed under the jurisdiction of Fengxian, and requested the Civil Affairs Department to transfer the matter to Mu County for review and reply. After the transfer to the relevant 14th and 15th districts of the above-mentioned areas, local people were convened to discuss and reply in detail. It is now known that Gu Wen, the head of the 14th district, convened a meeting on the 20th after receiving the order to solicit the opinions of the entire district. They all believed that the proposed annexation of the eastern section of the Yepu Pond River by Fengxian County, and the transfer of jurisdiction, was inconsistent with the provisions of Article 3, Item 1 of the Outline of the Administrative Regional Arrangement of Fengxian County. According to the natural boundary between the district and Fengxian, the Qianbu Jing River, the boundary line is clear and there is no need to change it. The proposal to transfer the eastern section of the Yepu Pond River under jurisdiction was considered to have no reason and was difficult to recognize. It was decided to pass this resolution and submit it to the county government for review. According to the change of county jurisdiction, the relationship is more than just the two districts, so it is appropriate to collect the opinions of the entire county conference and protest on the basis of reason, so as to avoid disputes. Investigation of the origin of firearms copied from the ship Zhou Liancheng, the leader of the first squad of the first team of the Songjiang Water Police District, reported yesterday that there was a suspicious ship from Bailongtan, and led the team to investigate, copying out a box cannon with eight bullets, and a Zhejiang Jiashan Water Police Detective symbol, and presented an official document. However, as a result of the review, there were still suspicious points, and the firearms were temporarily confiscated, and they were ordered to return to Shan to prepare a written proof. It is now known that the official document brought today was not stamped with a seal and is still difficult to release.</p>

The corrupt flesh was scraped off the body on that day, and the bones were steamed for examination yesterday (21st). The examination results were obtained in the afternoon. It was found that the sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs on the right side, and the eighth rib on the left side, had marks. Red was also found on the right dice bone, and there was mud in the skull. After the examination, the corpse was filled in and sealed, and the investigation was started.</p>
<p>Frequent News of Robbery in Lakeside Areas The lake bandits in the villages of Wu County have revived, and news of robberies in various villages is frequent. The 11th team of the 3rd District of the Water Police has been searching for bandits in the lakeside area for days. It was heard that some bandits had fled into the inner harbor, so the team went to Hengjing yesterday (21st) to search and suppress them. Yesterday, more than a dozen bandits went to the house of Li Fu'an, a farmer in Dongtang Village, Puzhuang, and robbed him of clothes and silver worth about 500 yuan before escaping.</p>

<p>Issues in the Trial of Cases by Temporary Courts The president of the High Court, Lin Biao, formerly used the cases tried by the temporary courts organized by various counties in accordance with the Emergency Crime Law to Endanger the Republic of China. According to Article 8, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 of the law, those who should be sent to this court for review are specifically for guilty verdicts. If the verdict is innocent, dismissed, not accepted, or the jurisdiction is incorrect, should it be submitted to this court for review? In another case, part of the verdict was guilty and part was innocent, dismissed, or not accepted. Once submitted, in addition to the guilty part being reviewed, should the remaining parts be reviewed together? The law does not have clear provisions on how to handle the matter. The matter has been submitted to the Ministry of Justice for instructions. It is now informed by the ministry's reply that the approval procedure stipulated in Article 8 of the Emergency Crime Law to Endanger the Republic of China is specifically for when the verdict is guilty. The provisions are clear and have been submitted to the Judicial Yuan for instructions and compliance. In a case where part of the verdict is guilty, a corresponding solution can be obtained. Yesterday, Chen County magistrate was specially instructed to know this.</p>
<p>Frequent Robbery Cases in the Countryside The house of Hua Jinshan, a villager from Huajiaqiao Township, Xin'an District, District 13 of the county, suddenly came to twelve bandits around 10 p.m. the night before last. They broke into the house, held pistols to intimidate, and searched wantonly, robbing clothes, jewelry, and single deeds. The loss was not small. The bandits were still not satisfied and went to the house of Hua Yanhu next door to rob. Unexpectedly, the valuables had already been hidden, and only more than ten yuan of silver and a few pieces of cloth were found. They carried the loot and went towards the station. The two families lost about 700-800 yuan. In the Yangjiaocao area outside the East Gate, the house of Xie Rongquan, a villager, was visited by seven or eight bandits the night before last. They broke into the house, and Xie heard the alarm and rushed out of the back door and called out to warn. The bandits knew they were prepared and fled. Afterwards, the direct branch of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau sent police to pursue them and found a suspicious boat nearby.

<p>Criminal Case of Riot by Unscrupulous Merchants Indicted: In Wu County, unscrupulous merchants destroyed three institutions including the Party Headquarters, and assaulted Wu Wenbi, an employee of the County Party Headquarters, and Lu Zao, an employee of the Zhongshan Daily. Wu Wenbi later died in the hospital due to his serious injuries. After the County Court and County Government successively apprehended criminals such as Ye Jinde and Jin Xiangsheng, Chief Prosecutor Yang Kongxi carefully investigated the entire case with witnesses. Now, the investigation is complete. Yesterday (the 20th), the criminal court filed a public indictment. The content of the indictment recognizes Jin Xiangsheng as the principal culprit in the assault that led to Wu Wenbi's death and should be punished with the highest penalty. Yu Yiqin, Zhu Kangpei, Ye Jinde, Zhang Chengguan, and Jiang Chaoyong should also bear joint criminal responsibility. Guo Junfu and Fan Gansheng were deemed to have not foreseen the assault and destruction, making it difficult to hold them jointly responsible. However, they openly gathered a crowd, failed to prevent the incident beforehand, and even joined in the violence at the time, releasing Hu Ruilin, so they cannot escape criminal liability. Each defendant is charged with the crime in the latter section of Article 157 of the Criminal Law. As for the reactionary elements, it is hoped that a special court will be organized according to the articles for endangering the Republic of China. The temporary court should be organized by the county magistrate and two judicial officials for trial. The procurator of the High Court also instructed that these matters be handled separately.</p>

Today (the 20th), Wu Cheng, a member of the trial, went to the countryside to confirm the cause of death. The deceased was from Shiba Mu Qiao and worked as an assistant in the Yunting Ye Fuchang dry goods store. He had been working at the store for half a month. The day before yesterday, he secretly stole a handgun from his colleague Xu Caibao (a member of the Yunting security team) and used it to commit robbery with the bandits.

<p>Petition to Suspend Business for Identifying Japanese Goods: Eleven industries in this city, including silk fabric, Guangzhou goods, and southern goods, closed their shops at noon on the 20th due to their involvement with Japanese goods. Slogans such as "Suspend Business to Identify Japanese Goods" were prominently posted at the entrances. All staff members of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Jiangdu County departed at 8:00 AM to inspect various stores for Japanese goods and implement sealing. The Superintendent specially dispatched a team with machine guns to guard the main thoroughfares. Additional troops were deployed for patrols to maintain order. The Public Security Bureau also increased the number of guards to maintain public order. However, merchants from various industries gathered at the Chamber of Commerce around 3:00 PM to petition. There was a large number of people. It was reported that during the inspection a few days ago, Zhang Kaitai Fu of the hat industry, Hengxingxiang of the Guangzhou goods store, and Xinyu of the clothing store were suspected of selling Japanese goods. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association sent personnel to Shanghai with samples for identification. It was confirmed that they were Japanese goods. The County Party Headquarters reported the matter and detained the staff members of the respective stores. Cao Yizhai, Gao Yuzhai, and Gao Baolin were still detained at the Public Security Bureau. This caused a dispute. The final result was to hold an emergency meeting at the Chamber of Commerce on the 21st, inviting the Superintendent and the Public Security Bureau to attend for discussion and public judgment.</p>
<p>After the Closure of the Lai Sheng An Canal Embankment, It Collapsed Again: Since the breach of the river, many reports have been recently submitted stating that the embankment has been closed. Unexpectedly, the Lai Sheng An River embankment, located south of Lujin and north of Zhao Guan Dam in the Jiangdu section, collapsed again for more than ten zhang a few days ago due to the weak construction. It washed away huts and newly planted wheat seedlings. The Huaiyang Flood Relief Association heard the news and convened a temporary emergency standing committee meeting yesterday (the 18th). A resolution was made to send a telegram to the province requesting them to send personnel to investigate and quickly provide remedies. A letter was also sent requesting the staff of the investigation division to bring cameras and rush to the newly breached dike today (the 19th) to investigate the actual situation. In addition, the Jiangbei Flood Disaster Relief Association also sent telegrams to the Provincial Government Construction Department yesterday, requesting that the responsible personnel be punished, and separately requesting assistance from fellow villagers in Beijing and Zhenjiang.</p>

<h3 id="e81">City Party Department Advises Students to Refrain from Petitioning in Beijing <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Instruction to Anti-Japanese National Salvation Associations of Various Schools</p>
<p>Due to the seriousness of the current situation, students from middle and high schools in this city are planning to go to Beijing to petition. Instruction No. 422 of the Executive Committee of the City Party Department to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Associations of various schools states: In order to comply with the matter, the City Education Bureau's letter is approved, stating: The Ministry of Education's Jia telegram was issued, followed by the President's edict of the National Government: The internal and foreign affairs have been well planned, and students of all schools should follow the government's repeated orders to study with peace of mind and not rush to Beijing to petition, which would waste their studies. It is ordered that the heads of all departments and bureaus and the principals of all schools be effectively responsible for stopping this. Since the Liaoji incident, the government has repeatedly warned students across the country, and this department has also repeatedly advised them, hoping that all departments, bureaus, and schools will sincerely persuade students to settle down and study, and not come to Beijing to petition. This is most important. Based on the previous instructions, it is hereby urgently telegraphed to be followed and notified to all public and unregistered private schools, and all subordinates are ordered to comply accordingly. This is the reply and it is hoped that you will follow it. Upon approval, after investigating this incident of [Name] Japan, with heavy troops invading Heilongjiang, our army ran out of ammunition and had no reinforcements, unable to resist and retreating, the situation is dangerous, and the country is facing difficult times. All who have blood and qi will surely be distressed and grieved. The students of all schools are planning to go to Beijing to appeal to the National Government to send troops to [Name] insult. This kind of patriotic sincerity is truly admirable. However, the Fourth National Congress has already resolved to invite Chairman Chiang to go north to resist the enemy, and Chairman Chiang has also resolved to go and recover lost territory. This is what our people hope from the government. The government has been able to implement it automatically, and there is no need to go to Beijing to petition at this time. If the students of all schools believe that it is still necessary to urge progress, then they only need to send representatives to present their case. If they gather [Name] masses, [Name] time and distance, it will not only be [Name] rate, leaving others with something to criticize, but also [Name] car delivery, [Name] in Beijing, [Name] the facts are quite difficult. The previous petition can be a lesson for you. Therefore, it is ordered that the association carefully consider and instruct all members to immediately stop going. This is most important. This order is issued by Standing Committee members Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, and Tao Baichuan on November 21st of the 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>The Donghua football team lost 0-2 to the British Army Shi Gude team yesterday at the Chinese Baseball Field. It was drizzling in the afternoon, so the number of spectators decreased significantly.

<p>In yesterday's big battle, Shi Gude had the upper hand throughout. In the first half, they dominated the field and were invincible. Donghua was under pressure throughout. In the second half, Donghua gradually gained momentum, but unfortunately, they failed by a narrow margin. Towards the end, due to the impulsive actions of the audience, the order was fortunately not disrupted. Both sides were also fierce, and several people were injured. In terms of performance, Shi Gude was indeed superior. Their coordination was pure and fiery, and their attacks were powerful. Since the ball was mostly at the feet of the British army, their victory was not accidental.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Donghua Team's Second Crisis <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>After the crisis passed, they thought the worst was over, but who knew that the result would still be a loss. Xi Qiaosheng attacked the goal three times, but all were just short. Shi Gude then returned with a vengeance. Duran invaded along the right side. Chen Pu caught up, Duran avoided the obstacle, and fired a long shot, reaching the right side. Williams passed the wing, and Dai caught the ball and attacked the goal. Although Zhou Xianyan caught the ball, he couldn't kick it out immediately. Pan Erden had already rushed in, encircling the goal. Zhou Xianyan then rushed out of the goal, having abandoned the ball. But it had already reached the penalty line, so he couldn't use his hands. Luofande intercepted the ball and shot it into the empty goal, hitting the side post and going in. Donghua then lost its defense.</p>

<p>Donghua tried hard to counterattack, and Dai Linjing worked hard to charge the goal, but failed to enter. Chen Yutian shot from afar, but lacked power. Qian Jingyong bravely stepped forward, but was blocked by Gray. Chen Yutian attacked forward again, but was kicked out by Hamilton. Missing several opportunities, dangerous situations appeared again. Pan Erden and Duran came together. Duran ran to the front of the goal and shot directly. Zhou Xianyan rushed up again and kicked it out. Pan Erden received the ball on the right, quickly passed it to the center, Lovander dodged the incoming person, passed it to the left again, and Williams shot again. Zhou Xianyan was still outside the goal, and the goal was lost again. Before long, the first half ended.</p>

<p>In the second half, Donghua gradually showed a turning trend, not as heavily pressed as in the first half. However, back and forth, neither side achieved any results. After most of the half had passed, the audience saw Xi Qiaosheng attacking the goal, and Hamilton bumped into him from the side, causing him to miss. This happened twice, causing a great uproar. According to the rules of the game, there is such a thing as a legal collision. The resulting dispute almost became unmanageable. Thus, both sides became increasingly intense due to the agitation of the audience. Zhou Xianyan and Hamilton were injured one after another, and Neil was sent off. The fierce battle ended in this way. I think that viewers should not blame the referee or others, but rather blame their own bad luck with the ball.</p>

<p>丨Unexpected丨</p>
<p>Only ten Lehua players arrived, and Yu Hengzhi volunteered to make up a team. As the whistle blew, the Lehua troops set out. Shanghai firmly defended their stronghold. After ten minutes of stalemate, Lehua launched attacks in all directions under strong defense. Zhou Shaowen shot the ball into the goal, opening the scoring. Shanghai attacked from the left and right, and center forward Whiston scored a goal, tying the score. Another opportunity came for Lehua, but Wan Xiangxian mismanaged the situation, facing the goalkeeper but shooting into the sky.</p>

<p>Shanghai remained calm, while Lehua was in a state of panic. The goalkeeper Lu and the two fullbacks defended with a triangular formation, but could not cover everything. Center forward Whiston was strong and aggressive, constantly attacking. Within thirty minutes, he scored three more goals, making the score 4-1 in the first half. In the second half, Shanghai was as strong as ever, but Lehua defended well, conceding only one goal in forty-five minutes, which can be considered a stroke of good luck in misfortune. In the end, the score was 5-1, and the Shanghai team triumphed.</p>

<p>The Chinese Football Association Committee held a meeting at the Jinling Restaurant the night before last. The committee members present were Le Xiurong (Chairman), Feng Jianwei, Ma Detai, Shen Kunnan, Shen Guoquan, and Zhou Jiaqi (Secretary). They discussed various matters related to the association. The meeting lasted for three hours before adjourning. The resolutions passed are excerpted below:</p>
<p>(1) The request of the Yiyong Team to change its name to "Yiyong" was approved.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the assault that occurred during the Yong'an vs. Postal Service match on November 8th, according to the report of the referee of the match and the investigation of the facts, it was initiated by the linesman sent by Yong'an who entered the field and used force. It was found that the linesman, in his position as a match official, started the fight, which was an absurd act. Since the linesman was sent by the Yong'an team, the team cannot escape blame for his incompetence. It was resolved to permanently revoke the qualifications of the linesman, Ruan Xiuzhang, to participate in matches, represent the Chinese Football Association, or hold any position within the association. In addition, a formal letter of warning should be sent to the team, urging them to conduct themselves properly and not repeat the same mistake, in order to maintain the spirit of the association. As for the match itself, since the captains of both teams stated to the referee at the time that they were unwilling to continue the match in order to avoid danger, and since the incident occurred outside of the players, the match was suspended. The Referee Committee and this committee both agreed that the match should be rescheduled.</p>

<p>— Liang Yangong</p>
<p>The sound of killing enemies is hoarse, strength is exhausted. The shattered land and rivers are unbearable to look back upon. Weaver Girl smashes the good home. A single tree trunk is difficult to support the great mansion. Brave men spit out only hot blood, husbands repay the country relying on loyal hearts. Gentlemen fold their hands, the common people are misled. Eternal sorrow lies in cowardly peace. Yagong, a Xiaolian, has been reading in seclusion in Shanghai in recent years, unaware of the chaos. Comparing this to the daily urgency of national disasters, he is filled with sorrow. Recently, he heard that General Ma had exhausted his strength and retreated. He was moved and immediately drafted a poem to express his feelings. Yagong is over seventy years old, but his concern for national affairs does not yield to the vigorous youth. This poem is specially recorded and submitted to Free Talk for public viewing. Zou Yifei adds a note.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Four Old Women Resisting Japan and Saving the Country <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Cold Cicada</p>
<p>In the sound of national crisis, the enthusiasm of young people to resist the enemy is self-evident. Even the products of sixty or seventy years ago, the decrepit old women of modern China, are also passionate and fully express their spirit of resisting Japan and saving the country. This is indeed something that we can take as a bit of comfort amidst extreme grief and indignation. I am eager to record it and tell the people of the country.</p>
<p>Beijing, October 2nd dispatch. Zhang Zongchang's mother recently arrived here from Dalian. She expressed to people that Xiaokun (ie Zongchang) must never be a slave to the country. I cannot teach him to do things that humiliate the country either. He will come to Ping in the next few days. If there is any act of selling the country, I will commit suicide to thank the people of the country.</p>
<p>Nanchang, October 2nd dispatch. Recently, an old woman shouted "Down with the Japanese invaders!" and threw herself into the Zhang River to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Nanjing, October 5th dispatch. Personnel from the Liaoning Court came to Beijing to report that Zang Shiyi is still being monitored by the violent Japanese. The Japanese army ordered him to sign. Zang refused and cried loudly, saying that his old mother was seventy years old and wanted to see her one last time before he died. The Japanese officer sent his mother to the South Manchurian Railway Station. They ordered a meeting, and ordered the mother to persuade Zang. The mother said, "Since ancient times, when a city falls, it falls completely. You must die rather than sign." The Japanese army then sent her away.</p>
<p>Harbin, November 3rd dispatch. Zhang Zuoxiang's guard, Feng Zhanhai's regiment, withdrew from the provincial capital when the Japanese army entered Jilin. It was the most complete retreat among the Jilin army. The Japanese military police headquarters in Jilin arrested Feng Zhanhai's mother-in-law, Song, and forced her to ask about the direction of Feng's retreat, and ordered her to lure Feng. Song refused, was beaten and almost died, and then was released.</p>
<p>Cold Cicada says. The word "death" in the dictionary is the most ominous term. People avoid talking about it, especially women. Today, Song would rather die than submit. An old woman in Nanchang encouraged the people of the country with her death. Zang's mother taught her son to die rather than sign. Zhang's mother guaranteed her son's non-traitorous behavior with her death. Every word of "death" is like a drop of blood. Among them, Zang's mother's few words are particularly strict in wording, decisive, and the intention is painful, turning around a hundred times. Hoping that the mountains and rivers will be restored after being broken. Teaching her son to seek life from death. The words are earnest, making people hear and feel sad. Alas, if women are still like this, what about men? If old people are still like this, what about young people? Shouldn't our patriotic youth, our patriotic men, work harder?</p>
<h3 id="e101">The National Salvation Movement of the Women's World <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's National Salvation Grand Alliance held a memorial service on the fifth floor of the Shanghai Women's Bank on the 20th of this month to comfort the flood victims and the compatriots in the Northeast. The tragic situation is difficult to describe in words. I hereby record one or two to inform all sectors.</p>
<p>The layout of the venue was different from usual. The four characters "Spirits Never Die" were hung high as a vertical scroll to replace the spirit tablet. Beside it were couplets that read "Protect our rivers and mountains, glorify our nation, and lead us only by the martyrs." "Repel the crazy bandits, kill the Japanese slaves, and who will continue the fight." This was offered by the Liangjiang Women's School. Three bottles of fresh flowers were placed on the table, without sacrificial dishes, incense, or candles. Xu Renyi read the will of the Prime Minister. Yang Xizhen offered flowers to the dead compatriots and bowed in silent mourning. Mao Wang Ruizhu reported the purpose of the meeting, detailing the tragic situation of the floods in various provinces and the brutal acts of the Japanese in forcibly occupying the Northeast, which made people unable to bear to hear it. Huang Shaolan read the eulogy, which was thousands of words long. There were painful words such as "How could it be that disaster suddenly arises within the walls, burning the beans with the stalks, and the pond fish suffer. The blood and fat are sprinkled on the plains, and the livers and brains are smeared on the ground. Hundreds, thousands, even billions, are injured or killed. It is sad to die physically, but it is even more painful to die mentally." The entire venue was solemn, and some even shed tears. Dozens of elegiac couplets were hung on the four walls, which cannot all be mentioned. I will record one or two from memory as follows. "The leopard skin still exists, and we are extremely angry. Sometimes we write to the government, sometimes we telegraph all parties. We must restore the territory of the Republic of China to the outside world. Longcheng is lost, and we hope that everyone will rise up to save the country. Either donate money or wear armor and wield weapons, and help General Ma together." "You all competed to take the lead in suppressing the rebellion and defending against insults. Remembering the heroic name in history, it will always remain a model. We are willing to be the successors in taking righteousness and achieving benevolence. It is the season of yellow flowers, and we jointly comfort the loyal souls." "All the comrades fought desperately to save the country, only hoping that someone will continue the fight. How many heads of the wooden clogs? Our women are summoning souls to establish the country. We only hope that the hearts of the people will not die, and take the means of Kublai Khan to come again." Li Guanfang said that the Republic of China takes the people as the masters, so the status of our women is equal to that of the empresses and princesses of the empire. We must recognize national affairs as our own affairs. In the past twenty years, this is the first time we have fought a war against foreign countries. Unfortunately, we failed. How bad is the harm? Soldiers must have the determination to die. We should sell our jewelry to help with military expenses. Huang Shaolan said that a country must be attacked from within before it is attacked by others. This external disaster was caused by internal strife. The National Government is different from the warlord era. Since the words "National" are crowned above the government, then all citizens, regardless of gender, should unite in the face of the disaster, the autumn of survival and urgency, and request the government to unite as soon as possible and unanimously deal with foreign countries. Therefore, our association has drafted a telegram today, asking the ladies of the Legislative Yuan, Song Meiling, Song Ailing, and Zhang Mojun, to present it to the government as soon as possible to send troops to rescue the Northeast and drive the Japanese slaves out of the country in order to consolidate national defense. If you agree with this, please raise your hands. Hundreds of jade arms were raised at the same time, and Camellia assumed the responsibility, all saying that the hearts of the people have not died, and the country can still be saved. Therefore, the telegram was drafted and sent according to the plan.</p>
<h3 id="e102">A Record of Zhang Gan, Who Severed His Finger to Swear an Oath <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Reason</p>
<p>Zhang Gan, a student of the Southeastern Medical College in this city, severed his finger yesterday to write an oath in blood, which caused a sensation near Nanshi. Mr. Zhang disregarded everything and severed his finger to show his determination. His ambition is commendable, and his situation is pitiful. Therefore, the beginning and end of the matter are recorded.</p>
<p>Organizing a Support Black Rescue Team The students of the school, in view of General Ma Zhanshan's isolated army fighting to the death with the Japanese army in the remote frontier, with their thin clouds in the sky, making contributions to the country, in order to increase his strength, specially organized a support Ink rescue team. More than 100 people signed up to participate at one time, and many of them were senior classmates with rich knowledge. The leader of the team, Zhang Gan, saw the situation and said that he was preparing to go to Heilongjiang and raise funds for medicines.</p>
<p>Difficulties Abound This time, the team leader notified all team members to sell all their belongings and books to pay for the journey. The team members were embarrassed, and many of them withdrew. As a result, only more than 30 people remained. This is the first difficulty for the team. The team leader also went to major pharmacies to solicit donations of medicines. The results were also very disappointing, and there was a tendency to prevent the progress. Mr. Zhang could not think of a way, so he decided to sacrifice a finger to encourage morale, but he still secretly did not let people know his plan.</p>
<p>Oath Ceremony Yesterday, Mr. Zhang announced that the oath ceremony would be held in the afternoon. All team members arrived on time (only the remaining 30 people). The oath was taken in the large exercise field. As soon as the team members finished reading the oath, Captain Zhang took a sharp blade and cut off his middle finger, writing an oath in blood. Everyone was shocked, but Captain Zhang did not care, and said to everyone, "If I retreat in the middle of the way due to fear of difficulties, I will have such a finger." The team members were greatly moved, and some of the classmates who had not joined also joined as a result. The number of team members increased from 30 to 80. After completing the oath, Captain Zhang held his severed finger and went to major pharmacies to solicit donations of medicines. The results were very satisfactory. It is heard that he will set off soon, taking the Jinpu and Pingsui lines, and then walking to Heilongjiang from Zhangjiakou.</p>
<h3 id="e103">General Ma's Song <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Xiaoshan</p>
<p>General Ma, a true general. His loyalty and righteousness reach the wind and clouds. The Japanese bandits are rampant and invading us urgently. Shenyang and Jilin were lost one after another early in the morning. Who will strengthen the border defense to support the army? Then teach thousands of miles without a strong wall. Is the corner of Longjiang not in danger? With you, it stands like a Great Wall. Holding a knife, he vowed to fight alone. It is good to collect my bones in horse skin. The righteous spirit has always moved gods and ghosts. Military reports were repeatedly reported three times a month. Alas, the affairs of the country are almost heartbreaking. Dare to say to defend against insults by strangling their throats. There are also those who hold soldiers and watch, and use their tongues to strike the thieves with loud voices. The battle at Jiangqiao was fierce, with dark clouds over the battlefield. No foreign aid was heard coming from the north. Do not expect to recover Beijing like Li Guo. You yourself are worthy of Zhang Suiyang. The little boy is deeply angry and has no inch of iron. A short song is attached to the chest. I wish you would complete this meritorious service of sweat and blood. Cast the bravery with hundred-refined gold. (This poem was just drafted, and the black wall has fallen. Those who sit and watch without saving are guilty to the sky.)</p>

<h3 id="e104">The Countryman Comes to Shanghai Again (Twenty-Four) <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Therefore, this time he came to Shanghai, he could be said to have gained an experience from the last time, learned a lesson, and saw that the sign was written on a certain hotel, he knew that this was not a real hotel, but a place for rich people to sleep. He saw many dressed-up and enchanting women coming in and out of that kind of hotel, and he remembered a common saying. The common saying says, "Opened a restaurant and not afraid of big bellies." This was originally said to mean that no matter how much food a person comes in, the restaurant can cope with it. Now, what kind of hotels in Shanghai, what kind of hotels, specialize in sleeping with women, which also corresponds to the saying - opened a restaurant and not afraid of big bellies - meaning: It doesn't matter if you make a big sister's belly bigger.</p>
<p>He knew that there was a hotel alley in Shanghai, and the hotels in that place were really places to eat, but he didn't know where the hotel alley was? Someone said, "The hotel alley has been demolished, and in the future, several floors of some kind of hotel will be built, and the real hotel will become a fake hotel." He turned a corner and saw many shops that seemed to be able to fill his belly. But he was a little timid and didn't dare to go in. At that time, he had to ask. Seeing a gentleman with a beard, he stepped forward to greet him and asked:</p>
<p>"Excuse me! Old sir! May I ask you a question! Is there a place to eat here?" The person he asked happened to be from Jiading, and he felt a little unhappy when he heard the words "old sir" in his heart. He wanted to make a few comments, but when he saw that it was an old countryman, he knew that he was unintentional, so he held back. He glanced at him and said:</p>
<p>"There are many places to eat. Aren't those on the left and right sides all restaurants?" The old gentleman from Jiading pointed to the left and right and hurried away.</p>
<p>The countryman looked in the direction he pointed, but the two red characters of the electric lights on the left were written "Taoyuan"; the two red characters of the electric lights on the right were written "Meiyuan".</p>
<p>He thought: Not good! I'm afraid I'm going to be fooled again. Taoyuan and Meiyuan are obviously the names of gardens. How can you say they are places to eat? I remember that in a small teahouse in our town, a storyteller who told the Romance of the Three Kingdoms came in the spring, and he said that Liu Guanzhang made a covenant in Taoyuan, didn't he have a Taoyuan? I didn't expect there to be a Taoyuan here, and I'm afraid Liu Guanzhang is still enshrined inside. As for Meiyuan, I heard that there is also a Meiyuan in Wuxi, and many people go to play when the plum blossoms are in bloom. This is obviously also a garden. Could it be that when it comes to Shanghai, it has become a restaurant? Running into the garden to eat, wouldn't it become a joke again?</p>
<p>He hesitated for a long time, but his stomach was rumbling with hunger, so he had to walk into Meiyuan. As soon as he walked in, he shouted, "Oh dear! It really is a garden! And it's a zoo!"</p>

<p>High of Two and a Half Nian in Half a Day</p>
<p>Exchange Market Tense, Buying Enthusiasm Flourishes Yesterday, the gold price rebounded sharply, once exceeding 660 taels, a vast and chaotic scene. Fluctuations of three or four taels in an instant were common. A total of seventeen or eighteen taels were reviewed. Finally, it rose more than twenty taels. People's hearts were firm and eager to buy. Initially, it rose sharply, and then receipts and payments varied, hovering around the border of fifty taels. At noon, the trend became stronger, exchange drafts were tense, and fellow traders and foreign speculators rushed to buy and settle. The buying enthusiasm on the table was strong, and the price moved forward bravely, leaping from forty-four or five taels to sixty-one taels. The market later closed for the weekend on Saturday. Looking at the situation this week, it was truly chaotic. Initially, it rose frequently, coinciding with the swap period, reaching a minimum of 590 taels and a high price of 670 taels. There was a difference of eighty-one or two taels in these six days, and the changes were unpredictable. In total, it rose fifty-seven or eight taels.</p>
<p>Morning Initial Changes Retreat in Advance Yesterday morning, the opening price rose by nine taels to 647 taels. Although large silver rose by one-quarter and silver prices by three-eighths, the footing was not excellent. It was caused by the United States seeming to have buying intentions, but the private telegram fell by one-quarter. Fuyu Hengyu and others first bought in, and then rose by more than two taels, from 46 taels 5 qian to 49 taels. However, Hengxing Yifeng Yongyuan Mao Qian Changxiang and others all sold out, and then retreated by more than three taels to 45 taels 5 qian. The US dollar was first bought spot by Mitsui at 33 yuan 8125, and competed with Tong Taichang and foreign firm Qiao Zhifu, and was then pushed up to 50 taels 05 qian. Then it went down, because Hengxing Shengda Bingxing Yuan Mao Yong and others successively sold out, falling by four or five taels to 45 taels 5 qian. When the British gold was announced, it was 46 taels, and the banks were doing each other's near-term 9 pence 5625, but the listing was not changed. The US dollar was reduced by two five, and the internal situation became tighter. Silver companies settled in January at 33 yuan 75, Yuanxing Yongfuchang and others bought in, and at 9:30 it was 49 taels and a half. Soon after, HSBC issued February 33 yuan 6875, and Hengyu Yuan Mao Yong Shunli Tong Taichang and others sold out, so the price suddenly softened, and it fell by six taels to 43 taels 3 qian at 10:10. It was heard that the exchange market had turned strong, and settlers were active. McGreggor issued February British gold at 19 and a half, and buyers gradually increased. Bingxing Tianxiang Chenfeng Yong Tong Taichang Qian Changxiang Hengxing Yuan and foreign firms came one after another, reaching a sharp point, and rose by more than eleven taels, but there were only two taels left. At 10 o'clock, it was 54 taels 4 qian. At this time, Hengxing still had sales, slightly more than two taels, at 51 taels 7 qian. Afterwards, Qian Changxiang Tong Taichang Yuan Mao Yong Dalian Gang Hengyu and others had even stronger buying intentions. As for the US dollar, the deal was 33 and a half yuan, and then 33 yuan 25, and the British gold was 9 pence 375, so the price rose sharply and reached a high of more than nine taels.

<h3 id="e109">Extreme Chaos in the Securities and Bond Market <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Eight types of bonds were suspended from trading in the morning due to sharp declines.</p>
<p>Market sentiment improved in the afternoon, and prices rebounded across the board.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for various bonds on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange were as follows: The National League's strong attitude toward the Japanese was ineffective, and the only way for China to save itself was through self-reliance. Market sentiment was increasingly chaotic. At the opening of the morning session, there was a very enthusiastic rush to sell by small investors, while investors were extremely reluctant to buy. Bond prices all fell sharply across the board, with the decline becoming more severe than the previous day. Eight types of bond futures were suspended from trading due to declines of 4 yuan, including the 1929 December Customs Bonds, the 1930 November Charity Bonds, the 2031 Next Month Bonds, the 2029 November Customs Bonds, and the November Consolidated Tax Bonds. The 1929 November Customs Bonds and the 1929 December Customs Bonds also experienced sharp declines and were suspended from trading in the second session. The situation in the market was extremely tense for a time, and small investors were particularly panicked. In the afternoon session, trading could not begin on time because margin calls had not been met. Market sentiment seemed to improve slightly due to slightly better news about the situation, and there was some trading in the gray market, with prices rebounding by about 1 yuan. Trading resumed after 4 p.m., and the market situation changed dramatically. Various parties aggressively bought in to cover their positions at low prices, demand was strong, and prices rose rapidly. Therefore, except for the bonds that had been suspended from trading in the morning, all others rose by 2-3 yuan compared to the morning, except for those with no trading in the afternoon. As a result, compared to the previous day, the 2029 December Customs Bonds rebounded by 0.3 yuan. The Reorganization Six percent Bonds, the Salary Reduction Salt Tax Bonds, and the Troops Reduction Principal Consolidated Tax Bonds only fell by about 1-2 yuan in the afternoon. The volatility of the bond market was unprecedented. Although market sentiment has stabilized somewhat due to the rebound in the bond market yesterday afternoon, it is feared that the situation is still not optimistic given the current environment. The total spot trading volume for the day was only 9,000 yuan, with futures trading reaching 9.9 million in the morning and only 3 million in the afternoon, for a total of 12.7 million yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is very weak, and the downward trend is intensifying. The worsening situation and the aggression of the violent Japanese have caused extreme panic. The silver shortage is becoming increasingly urgent, resulting in stagnant sales. All groups lack enthusiasm, leading to a surge in selling. The current month has broken the 50 tael threshold.</p>
<p>Near-Month Marked by Sharp Declines to 50 Taels</p>
<p>The opening of the near-month market was marked by weakness in US cotton and poor news, resulting in significant declines. Prices for all months fell by 8-9 cents to 1 tael. The market weakened further in the afternoon, with prices for all months falling another 8-9 cents to 1 tael 1 cent. The total trading volume was 31,600 bales. Sales included 1,300 bales of Dafu, 750 bales of Heshen, 800 bales of Tianlong, 1,300 bales of Shenda, and 850 bales of Xiesheng. Purchases included 900 bales of Qingfeng, 1,750 bales of Xincheng, 850 bales of Changfeng, and 550 bales of Taixing. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>

<p>Actual Demand Remains Scarce</p>
<p>According to investigations of current yarn sales, all groups purchased a total of 250 bales for the day, with domestic traders taking in 145 bales. The market trend is weak. Among customers, 45 bales went to the mainland, 30 bales to Shantou, 120 bales to Guangdong, 15 bales to Anqing, and 30 bales to a certain group.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Cotton Market Remains Mediocre <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is stable, and US cotton remains pessimistic, trending downward. However, gold prices remain firm, supporting the local cotton market. Furthermore, most bullish traders are tightening their holdings due to the worsening situation and concerns that the Pacific shipping lanes may be disrupted, preventing foreign cotton from arriving in Shanghai. However, factories have no buying interest, and the decline in the yarn market has naturally dampened demand. Nevertheless, inventory is too low, and supply is not strong, so a significant drop has not yet occurred.</p>
<p>Domestic Cotton Near-Month Firm, Distant-Month Weak</p>
<p>The opening of the domestic cotton market was mediocre. However, bullish traders are tightening their holdings for the current month, keeping the market firm. Distant months fell by 1.5-2 cents. In the afternoon, all months rose slightly by 0.5-1.2 cents. The total trading volume was 53,800 piculs. Sales included 2,000 piculs of Yuda, 1,700 piculs of Shenchang, 1,700 piculs of Changfeng, and 1,800 piculs of Chongyu. Purchases included 2,500 piculs of Yiyu, 2,000 piculs of Rongxing, 2,000 piculs of Yifeng, and 1,900 piculs of Yuande. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>

British cotton futures rose by 3 points, and spot prices rose by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 15 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to speculative selling, but later rebounded due to short covering. Pungo rose by 1.5 rupees, Oomra rose by 1.25 rupees, and Broach fell by 0.75 rupees.

<h3 id="e113">Uncertain Future for US Cotton <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 20th reported on the cotton market for the week, stating that demand from the trade decreased during the week, and old bulls also liquidated their positions. Optimism regarding the future of prices is based on the low prices and theoretical inflation. However, the near future of the cotton market remains uncertain. There is no indication of increased selling from the South, and reports indicate that hoarding continues unabated. Private estimates of ginned cotton as of November 14th are 13,472,000 bales, with a total harvest of 16,500,000 bales. According to the latest news, Southern banks have independently mortgaged 3,210,000 bales of raw cotton to support the New Orleans plan. This is still short 290,000 bales, but cooperatives and the Farm Administration Bureau will own approximately 3,500,000 bales of cotton this season.</p>

<p>Nantou: Yesterday, there were 20-30 shipments arriving. Sales in the city have been sluggish. Early West New Indica rice was also very popular. There was very little Flying Phoenix Thin Rice from Ningbo. According to mainland news, foreign Du Jian rice prices are stable, but sales in Shanghai are still not developing, with a small price increase of one corner. The price of local glutinous rice is extremely depressed, and the market continues to soften. There were slightly more shipments of Jiangsu and Tongxiang rice arriving, with little change in prices.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, there were still many shipments arriving, but sales plummeted. The demand for Changshu and Wuxi new Indica rice was very good, with top-quality rice being fixed. Second-quality rice fell by two corners. Early and late rice arrivals met with stagnant sales and were also short by two corners. Local glutinous rice is also weakening and sales are suddenly weak, with a small price of rice one corner. The arrival and sales of Shanghai Sharp rice were even, with no price increase or decrease. Each warehouse in the river factory had about 3,000 piculs of goods.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Foreign Rice Transactions Are Dull <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Wenzhou Rice Continues to Arrive and Sell</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw futures traders not selling, but neither domestic nor Changjiang groups inquired. The local market appetite was also weak. The overall market transactions were light, with only 100 tons of small twists for January opening at a price of 4 taels, 7 qian, and 2 fen. This cargo was originally sold by Xiangmao for 4 taels, 7 qian, and 5 fen, and has now fallen by another 3 fen. Only local markets are slightly managing spot goods, but the number of arrivals has been limited recently. Except for the continuous distribution of previously arrived goods, cargo owners are mainly holding firm, so the market has not seen a very drastic drop. However, for the market price to turn around, it is necessary for local merchants to sell smoothly. The total daily transaction volume was 600 bags of small twists, priced at 10 yuan, 0 jiao, 2 fen, and 2 li. In addition, 1,500 bags of newly arrived Wenzhou rice opened at a price of 10 yuan, 0 jiao, 2 fen, 9 li to 10 yuan, 0 jiao, 1 fen, 9 li, which was also managed by local markets.</p>

<p>Distant Months Show More Stable Short Covering</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw similar opening prices in the morning and afternoon, with various months generally showing a flat trend. Tianjin wheat prices plummeted by 1.34 yuan, which were due to the unstable situation and the unusually tight money supply. Most people's minds have been shrinking. Due to the thick stocks of factories, preparations for the current month have not increased, gradually forming a hedging situation. Although distant months are also trending weakly, speculative shorts have gradually covered their positions, and the market atmosphere has been slightly more stable. Looking at future steps, if the money supply does not ease, the market will still not be good. As a result, the current month fell by 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, December fell by 1 fen and 2.5 li, January and February fell by 7.5 li, March fell by 1 fen, and April fell by 7.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Wheat Futures Plunge 6-7 Fen <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Large-Scale Offloading by General Bulls</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market opened in the morning and afternoon, with the market for each month showing a consistent plunge. Foreign ports suddenly reported a price decline of about 1.34 yuan, causing most people to feel unusually weak. Furthermore, given the domestic situation and the increasingly prepared appearance of Japan, if the trend becomes serious, the domestic prices of various markets are bound to become chaotic. Since the trend is not good, most bulls have also closed their positions, causing declines in both near and distant terms. The lowest price for the current month reached 3 taels, 5 qian, and 4 fen, seemingly close to the closing price of the previous month. As a result, the current month fell by 7 fen compared to the previous day, December fell by 6 fen, January and February fell by 5 fen, March fell by 4 fen, and April fell by 5 fen.</p>

<p>Previously, due to a shortage of Xiamen tangerine cake, the market price had risen to 21-22 taels, and then it was completely out of stock for a long time. Yesterday, it was heard that the Taikoo Company's Guangdong liner had arrived from Xiamen in the afternoon, bringing in a batch of Xiamen Tangerine Cakes; the exact number is unknown. This batch is likely to be new goods. Today is Sunday, so it will be necessary to take samples and open the market tomorrow.</p>

<p>Factory-Direct Prices See Small Increases - Hard to Judge the Trend</p>
<p>Yesterday, the raw silk market in Shanghai was still stagnant. Although there were telegrams from overseas white silk factories transferring to Shanghai, prices from American firms were only 850-860 taels, and prices from French firms were 870-880 taels. Factory owners are firmly maintaining prices. However, British firms have continued to make purchases of Coarse Silk, with firms such as Gong An purchasing 40 packages of Qian Da Silk, and prices remaining firm.</p>

<p>Silk Filature Purchases are Also Weak... Prices for Wild Silk Remain Depressed</p>
<p>Due to economic panic in Europe and the United States, sales of silk fabrics have been sluggish. Waste silk from filatures in Shanghai is also increasingly sporadic. With European sales not picking up, the market atmosphere is increasingly weak. Sales of wild silk to France are still quiet. Although Bailigu and Guyi had negotiations for Jingxian tails, Xiangcheng handles, and Hankou scarves yesterday, the offered prices were not high, and transactions are pending. Local silk filatures have also been making weak purchases of white silk waste. Yesterday, they only purchased 100 piculs of Inlands clothing silk, with prices ranging from 70 to 82 taels.</p>

<p>Shanghai Stocks Approximately 13,000 Boxes</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Tunxi Gaozhuang Zhenmei Green Tea market continued to see strong transactions. British firms such as Xiehe, Yihuo, Jinlong, and Tongfu have not loosened their buying intentions. There were also sporadic transactions of Needle Tip and Pearl Tea, and the market was not quiet. The total transaction volume for the city was over 800 boxes, with prices remaining unchanged from the past few days. According to statistics, current stock levels in the market are only about 13,000 boxes, which, according to general tea merchants, should be easily cleared within the year.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Inventory Survey of Hardware and Tinplate <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The hardware market has also shown signs of gradually tightening during the recent tense national situation and financial market contraction. Although traders with ample cash flow had previously shown a tendency to expand, they have had to reduce their scope in the face of the recent perilous environment. As a result, the hardware market has seen little in the way of bulk transactions recently, except for sporadic transactions between door-to-door traders and factories. According to recent investigations, the most severely affected product in terms of market changes is tinplate. Pessimism is due to the belief among traders with inventory that the large amount of goods and slow sales will lead to unimaginable scenarios. As a result, the market is becoming increasingly weak, even to the point of collapsing, with losses reaching 5-6 taels per box. This is said to be the most drastic price decline since after the war. Therefore, traders in the market have deep concerns. However, to stabilize public sentiment, an inventory survey is being conducted to serve as a benchmark for market stabilization (unit: box).</p>

<p>Will Not Return to Guangdong or Go to Beijing</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Guangdong Fourth Plenary Session Was Informed by Telegram</p>
<p>The Guangdong side dispatched Ma Chaojun and Tan Zhen to Shanghai to welcome Hu Hanmin and Wang Jingwei back to Guangdong to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Guangdong Provincial Committee. At the same time, the Beijing side also invited Hu and Wang to go to Beijing to preside over the major affairs of the party and the country. Yesterday, according to Wang Jingwei's aides, at a time when diplomacy is pressing and the national situation is critical, Wang has decided not to leave Shanghai temporarily and has informed the Fourth Plenary Session of the Guangdong Provincial Committee by telegram. It is absolutely untrue that the Beijing side has stated that Wang has agreed to go to Beijing immediately. It is said that Hu Hanmin also holds the same view. The telegram from the Fourth Plenary Session of the Guangdong Provincial Committee to Hu and Wang, and Wang's reply, are recorded below:</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Zhantang, Mr. Wang Jingwei:</p>
<p>In view of the national crisis, the major affairs of the party and the country await discussion. The extraordinary meeting and representatives have repeatedly telegraphed, urging the two gentlemen to come to Guangdong together on a fixed date, which is understandable. Today, the General Assembly unanimously resolved to invite the two gentlemen to return to Guangdong on a fixed date to attend and guide the meeting, and resolved to continue the formal meeting only after the two gentlemen return to Guangdong, in order to comply with the sincere request of colleagues. Please make an early trip and do not neglect to pray, the Fourth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, issued from Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei replied by telegram yesterday, reading:</p>
<p>The Fourth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, Guangzhou:</p>
<p>I respectfully received your telegram. It is appropriate to attend the meeting, but the peace talks are mutually promoted by three comrades, Sun Zhesheng, Li Junpei, and Chen Youren, to return to Guangzhou to report. Zhaoming, Wu Tiyun, and Zou Haibin are in Shanghai to discuss various matters. This is the duty, and I dare not leave without permission. Recently, foreign aggression has become increasingly urgent and the national crisis is critical. I respectfully ask the General Assembly to convene a formal meeting as soon as possible, carry out all matters, establish the center of gravity of the party and the country, establish a guarantee of unity, and wish nothing but prayer. I hereby reply respectfully, I respectfully ask for your review. Wang Zhaoming, Ma.</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that the Guangdong representatives in Shanghai, Wang Qingwei, Wu Chaochu, Zou Lu, etc., held two meetings with Ma Chaojun, Tan Zhen, etc. yesterday to discuss political and diplomatic issues. Regarding the election matters of the Fourth Plenary Session, it is heard that the Guangdong side, due to the urgency of time, must begin the election as early as the 24th of this month. Wang and others, after the meeting, immediately asked the Beijing representatives to request the Beijing Fourth Plenary Session to postpone its closing until after the 24th, so that both parties could complete the elections simultaneously.</p>

<p>A Glimpse of High Public Morale</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association Submits a Document to the National Government Yesterday</p>
<p>Immediately Order the Army, Navy, and Air Force</p>
<p>To Recover the Lost Territories of the Northeast</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association telegraphed the National Government yesterday, stating, "Presenting this as a request: Our Association's Committee Member Xie Fusheng's proposal states: Regarding the case of Japan's invasion and occupation of our Northeast territories, the League of Nations has given Japan until November 16th to withdraw its troops. Not only has Japan shown no intention of withdrawing, but it has also advanced to attack our Heilongjiang Province and disrupt Tianjin. In order to prevent the expansion of this incident, we must apply pressure to Japan and, in accordance with Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, demand that member states of the League of Nations unanimously sever economic ties with Japan. Our government should first make a firm statement; otherwise, Japan will have nothing to fear, and the League of Nations will disregard us. Considering the diplomatic steps taken by the government, not only will this not hinder them, but it can also consolidate their foundation and expand their path. We request that the government resolutely implement this to maintain the nation's safety. Therefore, the proposed measures are listed below: (1) In accordance with Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, demand that member states of the League of Nations unanimously sever economic ties with Japan. (2) Our country's representative to the League of Nations should immediately propose measures under Article 16 and urge the League of Nations to further address the Northeast incident. (3) The government should invite Chinese and foreign journalists to formally announce and formulate laws to punish people who buy and sell Japanese goods, so that the boycott of Japanese goods can have a legal basis and assistance. The above proposal was approved by the 14th Executive Committee meeting of our Association, and it was requested that the National Government immediately use force to recover the lost territories of the Northeast and record it. Based on the above circumstances, we hereby submit this document for your kind review and approval for implementation, and request that you immediately order the Army, Navy, and Air Force to use force to recover the lost territories of the Northeast and restore our country's territory, which would be for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the National Government."</p>
<h3 id="e127">Telegram from the Student Delegation of Guangdong and Guangxi <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Entire Army to Proceed to Heilongjiang to Recover the Three Northeastern Provinces by a Specific Date</p>
<p>The delegation of students from Guangdong and Guangxi provinces and Guangzhou City attending the National Student Anti-Japanese Congress telegraphed the Fourth Plenary Session in Nanjing and General Zhang Fakui yesterday, requesting that troops be dispatched to recover the three Northeastern Provinces. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram 1: To the Fourth National Congress in Nanjing: The Japanese are invading us, and the entire nation is filled with shared animosity. However, millions of soldiers advocate non-resistance and shamelessly cling to life, losing territory and disgracing the country, which is heartbreaking to speak of. General Ma Zhanshan, deeply understanding righteousness and defending the territory, bravely defends the country with a small army, unyielding and indomitable, frustrating the strong invaders, and bringing glory to the nation. However, due to exhausted ammunition and no reinforcements, the army was defeated, and the province was lost. The entire nation grieves. Therefore, the representatives dare to make a request to all of you, hoping you will carefully consider it. Zhang Xueliang, holding 300,000 troops, knows that the Heilongjiang army's resistance against Japan is a disparity in numbers, and the army is isolated and weak. A long battle is sure to fail. Yet, he ultimately does not mobilize a single soldier or general, treating the survival of Heilongjiang Province as if he does not see it. What are his intentions? It is truly suspicious. They are soldiers who are supposed to defend the territory but instead sell it, indulging in their duties, and nothing is worse than this. Is Heilongjiang Province not our land, and are the people of Heilongjiang not our army? If they are not senseless and insane, how could they go this far? Considering this comprehensively, even if they do not intend to collude with the Japanese in practice, they are bound to be close to betraying the country. (Omission) Therefore, the representatives, with tears of blood, bow again and again, pleading for the people of Heilongjiang, and for the survival of the nation, dare to request that Zhang Xueliang be ordered to proceed to Heilongjiang with the entire army by a specific date to assist Ma Zhanshan and recover the three provinces, and that Commander Chiang be ordered to dispatch troops to the border to strengthen national defense and fulfill his duties. Fourth Army Commander Zhang Fakui has already requested permission to depart to promote the national cause, and the government authorities should understand his patriotic fervor and provide him with the necessary facilities so that he can serve on the battlefield and fulfill his long-cherished wish. The telegram is filled with sorrow and urgency. We humbly request your consideration. Respectfully, the Student Delegation of Guangdong Province, Guangxi Province, and Guangzhou City."</p>
<p>Telegram 2: To National Revolutionary Fourth Army Commander Zhang, Upon Reading Your Telegram: Your patriotic fervor overflows your words, and your righteous indignation stirs the divine land. You vow to die with the soldiers who serve the country and do not wish to exist with the soldiers who shamelessly do not resist. This heart and this ambition are worthy of song and tears. Your loyalty is deeply admired. The representatives are willing to use their blood and sincerity, together with the students of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, to be your backing, earnestly requesting that you immediately dispatch troops to assist Heilongjiang, annihilate the Japanese invaders, and return our territory. The telegram expresses our heartfelt wishes. Respectfully, the Student Delegation of Guangdong Province, Guangxi Province, and Guangzhou City Attending the National Student Anti-Japanese Congress."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Zhang Fakui Speaks of His Determination to Assist Heilongjiang <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Willing to Die in the Same Place as Chairman Ma</p>
<p>Zhang Fakui, Commander of the National Revolutionary Fourth Army, has been in Shanghai for several days seeking medical treatment. Previously, due to his abhorrence of Japanese atrocities and Ma Zhanshan's isolated army resisting Japan without assistance, he telegraphed Guangdong requesting permission to volunteer. It is now heard that Guangdong has expressed great support for Zhang's request, but there has been no official reply. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency paid him a visit yesterday and spoke with him. At the same time, the reporter, representing the Northeast Hometown Anti-Japanese Association, had some contact regarding the practical work of assisting Heilongjiang. Here is a record of his conversation in the capacity of receiving representatives: (1) Guangdong has not yet replied to the request to volunteer, but it is expected that there will be a reply soon, and it can be confidently asserted that the request will be approved. The reason why a reply could not be given immediately is that Guangdong is currently holding the Fourth Plenary Session, and this matter must be resolved through deliberation. It is expected that in the future, Commanders Li and Bai will also have important statements. (2) Assisting Heilongjiang requires the troops to be transferred to Heilongjiang Province and merged with Ma's forces. Although the troops under my command are not numerous, we all believe that the amount of troops is not important. Even I personally can serve as a low-ranking officer to provide assistance. I have this determination, not because I want to show off. When assisting in the future, it would be even better if we can achieve contact with Ma's army. Otherwise, I personally am willing to die in the same place as Chairman Ma. (3) The current government does not seek self-reliance but relies on the League of Nations, which is quite strange. China has millions of troops nationwide. If it is said that they cannot compete with Japan, I find it hard to believe. Although Japanese weapons are extremely well-equipped, if everyone in China has the determination to sacrifice, using one hundred to fight against one, it would be enough to kill the Japanese. If the government says that sending troops is a war against Japan, then that is even more incorrect. Sending troops is to assist the anti-Japanese forces, and anti-Japanese action is out of self-defense, which is different from Japan's dispatch of troops to invade and occupy the three Northeastern Provinces. Since Japan is already engaging in acts of war against us, why can't our country even defend itself? Ma Zhanshan is only a brigade commander, yet he is able to resist such a heavy force, which is truly admirable. The Japanese troops attacking Heilongjiang are increasing daily, but our government has not sent a single soldier or general to provide assistance, sitting idly by while this isolated army is trapped in a desperate situation, which is regrettable. (4) Zhang Xueliang lost the land of Liaoning and Jilin this time and did not send troops to assist Ma Zhanshan. From a military perspective, he should have apologized to the people long ago. Why should he wait for the government and the people to discuss it? (5) The people's hearts in the country are not dead, and public morale is exceptionally indignant. In the future, when it becomes unbearable, the people will inevitably rise up on their own to resist the violent Japanese.</p>
<p>The Shanghai New Medicine Trade Association sent a letter to Zhang Fakui yesterday, stating, "To Commander Zhang, Upon reading your telegram, we were deeply moved to tears. Since the founding of the Republic of China, only General Han and Chairman Ma have pointed their guns outward. Your Excellency resolutely steps forward to eliminate demons and monsters for the world and to fight for the survival of the Chinese nation. Your loyal heart and fierce courage move people and heaven. Our Association is willing to respectfully offer provisions and comfort the righteous army. However, it is heard that the dispatch of the elite troops is still awaiting the issuance of a government order. Although this is a discipline that soldiers should abide by, in special circumstances, as long as one's conscience is clear, it seems permissible to act according to circumstances. The return of Yue Fei's army was a source of regret for the people. We hope Your Excellency will consider this deeply."</p>

<p>And Orders the Intensification of Training</p>
<p>The Volunteer Army Committee of the Municipal Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, in view of the violent Japanese occupation of Heilongjiang, expressed outrage among all the troops, and urgently telegraphed Commander Chiang yesterday, stating, "To Commander Chiang in Nanjing: The violent Japanese are invading, and the entire nation shares the same animosity.

We are willing to go to the front lines and serve on the battlefield. We are now ready and awaiting orders. Respectfully, the Volunteer Army Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association."</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Municipal Volunteer Army has been training for nearly two months since it began. Recently, due to the urgency of the military situation in the front, the Army Committee has issued instructions to the soldiers of each regiment and battalion to intensify training. Committee members Chen Yafu and Li Yongxiang take turns to inspect each regiment and battalion training ground every morning at 7:00 AM, and provide speeches to encourage the troops. It is also heard that in order to boost the morale of the soldiers, the army song has been formulated and will be printed and distributed to the soldiers of each regiment to sing and practice within the next few days.</p>

<p>The Inactive Soldiers Association of the Republic of China sent a telegram stating, "To all groups across the country through various newspapers: The violent Japanese are taking advantage of our country's calamities and disasters to seize our territory. All those with blood and qi are filled with rage. Since the loss of the Northeast, it has been two months, and the whole country is in an uproar, with everyone watching. However, our government only knows how to rely on the League of Nations and does not make preparations for self-reliance. General Ma Zhanshan, with a small force, is resisting the Japanese national army. He is isolated and in danger. Telegrams for help are flying like snowflakes, but we have not seen a single soldier from the central government reinforce him. Ultimately, due to the disparity in numbers, he withdrew from Heihe. We, as members of the Inactive Soldiers Association, cannot sit idly by and watch the national disaster. We pledge to immediately join the front lines and exist and perish with the country. We will disarm when the country is fully restored. In addition to organizing a National Salvation Vanguard Team and telegraphing the authorities to request permission to suppress the bandits, we respectfully announce our humble efforts, hoping for your public consideration. Respectfully, the Inactive Soldiers Association of the Republic of China."</p>

<h3 id="e134">The Case of the Japanese Consulate General Illegally Arresting Returning Overseas Chinese <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>One of the Detained Overseas Chinese is Named Zhang Debao</p>
<p>The Japanese Consulate General Claims that Zhang Committed a Crime in Japan</p>
<p>Without Prior Permission from Our Country's Authorities</p>
<p>Section Chief Huang of the Public Security Bureau Negotiated Yesterday</p>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports: The Japanese Consulate General in this port illegally arrested one of our country's overseas Chinese on the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru, which came to Shanghai from Japan, at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. At around 6:00 PM on the same day, when the Japanese ship Rokko Maru entered the port, the Consulate General again sent personnel to arrest returning overseas Chinese. At that time, it was rumored that as many as four people had been illegally arrested by the Consulate General. At this time of strained relations between China and Japan, all sectors of Shanghai were extremely indignant upon hearing this. After receiving this report, the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately sent personnel to investigate the truth. It was found that when the Nagasaki Maru entered the port, the Japanese Consulate General did illegally arrest our returning overseas Chinese citizen. The detained overseas Chinese is named Zhang Debao, who recently returned from Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. As for the Japanese ship Rokko Maru at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the question, although the Japanese Consulate General sent personnel to search, no one was detained. After receiving the report, the Municipal Public Security Bureau believed that the Consulate General had not notified our country's authorities beforehand and had arbitrarily arrested returning overseas Chinese, which was extremely illegal. The Director of the Public Security Bureau, Chen Xizeng, sent the Second Section Chief of the Bureau, Huang Guangdou, to the Japanese Consulate General yesterday to negotiate and thoroughly investigate the truth. The Japanese Consulate General replied verbally that the arrested overseas Chinese Zhang Debao, on the evening of the 11th of this month, in Kurosu Town, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan, together with overseas Chinese Jin He Biao, committed the crime of plotting to kill the Chinese merchant Lin Shunan, who had been living in Japan for a long time, for money. Afterwards, they carried the money and fled back to China. The police station in that county telegraphed the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, requesting that Zhang and others be arrested when they came to Shanghai in order to extradite them back to Japan. When the Nagasaki Maru entered the port, only Zhang Debao was arrested. Therefore, at around 6:00 PM, they searched the entering Rokko Maru again. As a result, Jin He Biao was not found. Therefore, only Zhang Debao was arrested the day before yesterday. After listening, Section Chief Huang negotiated, asking why the authorities of our country were not notified in advance, and returned to overseas Chinese without authorization. Regardless of whether the cases committed are true or not, the procedures are not in compliance. He immediately negotiated verbally with the Japanese Consulate General, requesting extradition, and on the other hand, returned to the bureau to report to Director Chen. It is heard that the Japanese Consulate General has not yet made any statement regarding the extradition. The Public Security Bureau has already submitted the facts to the Municipal Government and requested serious negotiations.</p>

<p>And Promises to Punish the Japanese Who Caused the Incident</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports: At around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, four Japanese thugs suddenly appeared at the Zhabei branch of the Anti-Japanese Association inside the Zhongxing Theater on Zhongxing Road. Three were wearing Western suits and one was wearing Chinese clothes. They led more than forty Japanese thugs disguised in Chinese clothes, carrying wooden sticks and hiring three cargo trucks, hoping to forcibly transport the sealed scrap iron from the site. At that time, the situation was very serious, and the large number of Japanese thugs in Chinese clothes with weapons were especially aggressive in their provocations. The branch immediately telegraphed the Fifth District Police Station under its jurisdiction. After receiving the report, District Chief Wang Zhijing immediately sent staff member Zhou Chunyu, supervisor Ren Runsheng, and the police chief to suppress the incident. At that time, a large number of Japanese thugs fled upon hearing the news, while the four Japanese ringleaders were detained by the Anti-Japanese Association branch. District Chief Wang then took them to the Fifth Police Station for questioning. It was learned that the four ringleaders, the one wearing Chinese clothes was named Nakamura Nagayoshi, and the other three were named Nagawoku, Hosotani Nara, and Nakamura Kan, all residing at No. 60 Xingye Lane, Shigaota Road. They were instigated by a Japanese named Sai, which led to this unreasonable act. At that time, the Municipal Public Security Bureau also telegraphed the Japanese Consulate General, questioning the large number of Japanese thugs</p>
<p>The Japanese Consulate General sent Yoshitake Kazuo and Akaboshi Kazuki to the Fifth District Headquarters to request extradition. At that time, they deeply apologized for the excessive actions of these Japanese thugs and were willing to bring them back for punishment. The Fifth District Police Station agreed, and they were extradited back. Yesterday, the Municipal Public Security Bureau reported the situation to the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 20th of this month, more than forty Japanese thugs, each holding wooden sticks and weapons, threatened to enter the storage department of the Zhabei Inspection Station of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to forcibly loot the confiscated Japanese goods. At that time, the situation was quite tense, and nearby residents</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>were frightened. Fortunately, the Fifth District Chief Wang Zhijing of the Public Security Bureau led all the police officers to arrive, and the Garrison Headquarters of the Municipal Government sent personnel to assist, and made every effort to stop the incident. Later, representatives of the Civil Union, the Shanghai North District Security Corps, the Fourth Section Fire Brigade, the Shanghai National Martial Arts Hall, and the Anti-Japanese Association of the Academic Community, such as Wang Zhixiang, Ye Qichang, and He Shigong, came to express their condolences. The incident was resolved peacefully, thanks to the proper handling by the authorities, which ensured that the Japanese thugs could not run rampant in the Chinese area.</p>

<p>Correspondence between a Bureau and the Taxpayers' Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association previously sent a letter to the Public Concession Bureau to stop the landing of the Japanese Marine Corps. The Association then received a reply from Mackie, the Acting Director of the Public Concession Bureau, stating: "Received your letter of October 30, regarding the letter from the Women's National Salvation League and Mr. Wang Xiaozhai concerning the report of Japanese sailors planning to land and deploy in the Public Concession. After investigation, the reported details do not match the facts. If your Association's representatives visit our Bureau, Mr. Fei, the Director-General, will explain everything to dispel any misunderstandings. We hereby reply accordingly." The Taxpayers' Association again sent a letter to the Director of the Public Concession Bureau yesterday, stating: "To the Director-General: Received your Bureau's reply No. 5977 of November 3, regarding the landing of the Japanese Naval Marine Corps. Our Association believes that the actual situation of the case is indeed something that cannot be expressed in writing. Please have your Bureau delegate He Huiban De Kui to visit our Association to explain everything. We hereby send this letter, hoping you will investigate and handle it accordingly."</p>

<p>Zhou Xuechang Suppresses the People's Movement</p>
<p>Appealing to the Press for Justice</p>
<p>Ms. Sun Xiangjie, a representative of the Beiping Women's Anti-Japanese Association, the National Salvation Association, and the Middle School Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, hosted the local press at the New Richard's Restaurant at 2:00 PM yesterday to report on the truth of Zhou Xuechang, the Organizing Committee Member of the Beiping Municipal Party Department and Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, suppressing the anti-Japanese movement, and appealed to the press to uphold justice. More than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended. Ms. Sun chaired the meeting and reported: "Since the September 18th Incident, public morale in Beiping has been high, demanding resistance against the violent acts of Japanese imperialism. The authorities have consistently adhered to the policy of non-resistance. Zhou Xuechang, the Organizing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Department and Director of the Education Bureau, especially implemented the policy of non-resistance, ordering the cessation of anti-Japanese activities in the academic circles and requesting the Municipal Government to order the Public Security Bureau to tear down the anti-Japanese slogans of the Beiping academic circles, and suppressed the Women's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. Teachers and students of the First Municipal Girls' Middle School participated in various anti-Japanese movements. Zhou ordered the police to surround the school and wanted to arrest Xiangjie because Xiangjie was the principal of the First Girls' Middle School, which led to the great tragedy of the First Girls' Middle School on October 29th. Students were beaten and injured. After the Tianjin Incident, Zhou Xuechang even more strictly prohibited students from holding anti-Japanese gatherings. Therefore, the people of Beiping unanimously requested the liberation of the people's anti-Japanese movement from Beijing and Shanghai, and the women's circles were especially eager. All the details regarding the prevention of gatherings and the closure of schools have been reported in the newspapers and will not be repeated. I now represent the two associations, requesting the Shanghai press to uphold justice and announce everything so that it is known that public morale in Beiping is still high, but because Zhou Xuechang has suppressed it, the people's military movement cannot be resumed."</p>

<p>Su Rulin Holds a Letter and Visits Hu Hanmin</p>
<p>Expressing the Willingness to Exist and Perish with China</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Belgian overseas Chinese named Su Rulin (R Sorelle) held three English letters and took a car to Hu Hanmin's residence at No. 301 Meyer Shea Road in the French Concession to offer his opinions on Japan. One letter was addressed to Hu Hanmin, one to Wang Jingwei, and the other to Wu Chaochu, all of which were entrusted to Hu's residence for delivery. The letters were very long, and the envelopes were sealed with sealing wax. After the letters were delivered to Wang and Hu for opening, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency had a brief conversation with the Belgian. The Belgian, who was about 50 years old, spoke English and said that he extremely hates the atrocities of the Japanese this time and is willing to exist and perish with China. The League of Nations is completely fooling China, and the Chinese should urgently rise up to rescue themselves. Therefore, he greatly admires General Ma Zhanshan's resistance against Japan, and will never express support for soldiers who sit idly by and watch China's demise. While speaking, he took out a full-body photo of Ma Zhanshan from his arms and showed it to the reporter, pointing to Ma's photo and saying, "This is truly a great man of China." The reporter further inquired about the contents of the letter, and he replied that the general idea was the same as what he had just said. After speaking, he waved his hat and shouted "Long live China" and left.</p>

<p>Checking Japanese Goods in Nanshi Shops: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various trade associations yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, on the 19th of this month, we received a letter from the Inspection Department of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, stating that according to the report from Nanshi, Japanese goods on the streets have become as rare as morning stars, but sporadic Japanese goods still flow in continuously. At this critical moment for the Japanese invaders, our association can only intensify its work and redouble its efforts to achieve the effect of resistance. We plan to order all inspectors to go to various shops to conduct inspections and thoroughly eliminate Japanese goods in the shortest possible time." In response to this, we hereby send this letter to your association, hoping that you will inform each industry inspection team to immediately send personnel to Nanshi to handle the matter. Sincerely, etc. We are sending this letter for your perusal and implementation.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Replies to the Paper Industry Association: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday addressed the matter of handling and sealing up Japanese goods in a letter to the Paper Industry Association, stating: "To whom it may concern, on the 20th of this month, we received a letter stating that the Cotton Industry Association and others were urging a resolution on the method of handling Japanese goods. When Luo Qinghua convened a dinner and presented the original letter, requesting the association's seal, he was not granted permission. Why is the Paper Industry Association still listed in the newspaper report? Please investigate and clarify." The following is a detailed response: (1) The letter from the Cotton Cloth Industry Association and eighteen other associations to our association urging a resolution on the method of handling Japanese goods does indeed list your association and bears your association's seal. The documents are all on file and can be inspected by your association's representatives. (2) According to a statement from Mr. Luo Qinghua, the dinner that day was convened by Mr. Ye Xiaoshan of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association in the name of Luo Qinghua et al. of the Shanghai Merchants Club Preparatory Office. During the dinner, someone mentioned whether the Silk and Satin Industry Association should affix its seal, and the response was that the matter of affixing the seal should be discussed with the association. Given that the Silk and Satin Industry Association did not affix its seal in this case, there was no reason to persuade other industries to affix their seals. This can be used as evidence to the contrary. We hereby reply to your association for your review and immediate publication of a correction to reflect the facts. Furthermore, this type of matter is of great importance to the reputation of organizations. The facts should be verified first and not hastily published. We hope that you will be cautious in the future. This is of utmost importance. To the Shanghai Paper Industry Association.</p>

All are welcome to listen and enter the venue at will, without the need for tickets.</p>
<p>Telegram to International Women's Organizations: The National Association of the Chinese Christian Women's Youth Association believes that the Japanese occupation of Heilongjiang Province is an extremely serious situation. Therefore, yesterday, they sent another telegram to international women's organizations, explaining Japan's violation of the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and requesting that all countries fulfill their obligations under the three treaties to sanction Japan with strength. The original telegram is translated below: To the World Association of the Christian Women's Youth Association in Geneva, and to other international women's organizations: Japan has occupied Chinese territory by force and interfered with the administration of Liaoning and Jilin by trickery for two months. Their ambition is increasing without end. This kind of violent act violates the Nine-Power Treaty and destroys the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Although the League of Nations has repeatedly urged Japan to withdraw its troops, Japan has always ignored it. Now, it has intensified its actions, dared to attack Heilongjiang Province, and occupied Qiqihar on the Eastern Railway on a convenient day. Japan has violated Article 15, Paragraph 6 of the League of Nations Covenant. Therefore, the Board of Directors should immediately invoke Article 16 of the Covenant and implement more effective sanctions to ensure world peace and maintain the prestige of the League of Nations. If the League of Nations continues to procrastinate and fail to uphold justice and effectively urge Japan to withdraw its troops against this country that disregards international treaties, destroys peace in the Far East, and endangers world peace, China will have to seek its own defense to restore its territorial and administrative integrity and safeguard world justice and humanity. The current situation is serious and has reached its limit. The Chinese people unanimously oppose the five principles or compromises proposed by Japan in the League of Nations, and we absolutely cannot recognize the Twenty-One Demands that China was previously forced to sign under Japanese oppression. Moreover, direct negotiations are not allowed under this kind of military threat unless Japan fulfills its treaty obligations and withdraws its troops. China will not accept other mediation conditions. We hope that you will convey this message to the women's organizations of the countries that have signed the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and ask them to urge their respective governments to fulfill their obligations under the above three treaties and sanction Japan's atrocities with strength. Sincerely, Ding Shujing and Ma of the National Association of the Chinese Christian Women's Youth Association.</p>
<p>Letter Requesting Rejection of Korean Products: The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association stating: "We received a letter from Chen Yaonan stating that the report in the newspaper that the Anti-Japanese Association sent a letter to the Korean Chamber of Commerce allowing the sale of Korean apples and Korean white ginseng, etc., is shocking. Korea is currently under Japanese control, and the company selling these apples is the Japanese-owned Kabushiki Gaisha, which proves that they are enemy goods. Since Korea is a Japanese dependency, its products should be regarded as enemy goods. If they are allowed to circulate, then enemy goods will be renamed goods and flow into China, which will invisibly eliminate the effect of resistance. Moreover, the Wan'an incident arose from the massacre of overseas Chinese by Koreans. Selling their goods would be a contradiction. Please forward this letter to the Anti-Japanese Association to clarify the doubts."</p>

<h3 id="e142">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Announces Prohibition of Raising Prices of National Goods <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued an urgent notice yesterday regarding the prohibition of raising the prices of national goods. The notice stated that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Instruction No. 16769 was issued based on the Ministry of Industry Instruction No. Zi 8562. The Ministry of Industry stated that in February of this year, it received a report from the Fujian National Goods Promotion Association requesting a prohibition on raising the prices of national goods, and it had ordered the bureau to issue a notice. In June, the Executive Yuan issued a letter from the Central Secretariat based on a report from the Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters requesting a strict prohibition on unscrupulous merchants raising prices after , and a circular was issued to each agency. Now, it is reported that at a time when the national goods movement is being vigorously promoted, there are still merchants who transport and sell national goods who disregard the overall situation, seek petty profits, and take the opportunity to raise prices, which is extremely abhorrent. It is important to know that the higher the price of national goods, the smoother the sale of foreign goods. This not only infringes upon the interests of the owner, but also undermines the progress of the nation. It is appropriate to reiterate the previous order and order the chamber of commerce to convene industrialists and merchants to form a national goods evaluation committee to investigate the national goods sold on the market in detail and immediately reduce the prices of those who have raised prices. At the same time, the public should be notified that if unscrupulous merchants raise prices, they will be allowed to report them by name and be punished accordingly to serve as a warning and to encourage others. In response to this, the 20th Executive Committee of the Chamber decided that the selection of members for the evaluation committee should be submitted to the Standing Committee. All matters relating to the prohibition of raising the prices of national goods will be announced to the industrial and commercial sectors of the city for compliance. It is hereby announced in the newspaper that all national goods industrial and commercial sectors are expected to comply.</p>

<p>Mayor Zhang of the Municipal Government previously determined to dredge the Suzhou River due to its siltation, which hindered water traffic. He decided to dredge the section from Waibaidu Bridge to Yuji Mound, which is the most important. Since the Dredging Bureau has both talent and equipment, he decided to order the Dredging Bureau to dredge it under the supervision of the Municipal Government. It has already been opened to the bottom of Xizang Road. The funds for dredging the river have also been discussed and agreed upon, with the Municipal Government allocating 20,000 taels per year. It has now been half a year, and Mayor Zhang has ordered the Municipal Finance Bureau to allocate 10,000 taels to be sent to the Dredging Bureau for use.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Kidnapping Bandits Kidnap the Wrong God of Wealth <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The City Bank President is Safe and Sound</p>
<p>The Accountant of Huiwentang Acts as a Representative</p>
<p>The Bandits Seize the Yuejie Police Officer's Gun Mid-Kidnapping</p>
<p>Fortunately, Xu Fu's Two Sons Temporarily Changed Their Surnames</p>
<p>At around 10 o'clock yesterday morning, a kidnapping case occurred at the corner of Avenue Joffre and Rue Bédier in the French Concession, where the bandits mistakenly kidnapped the wrong person. The real target of the kidnapping was Xu Fu, a well-known former Chief of the Accounting Office of the National Revolutionary Army General Headquarters, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, and current President of the Shanghai City Bank. However, the bandits confusedly kidnapped Lin Yongming, the accountant of the Huiwentang Printing Bureau at No. 5 Henan Road. This substitution is rare in kidnapping cases. When our reporter visited last night, President Xu and his relatives were gathered together, enjoying themselves. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Fu Has Held Important Positions: Xu Fu, courtesy name Shengchan, is in his fifties and is a native of Zhenhai, Zhejiang. He once served as Chief of the Accounting Office of the National Revolutionary Army General Headquarters and Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, among other important positions. He is currently the President of the Shanghai City Bank (on Tianjin Road) and resides in a large building at No. 15 Deqing Lane, Tongfu Lane, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. Xu has two sons, the elder named Zhengjiao, 19 years old, a student at Fudan University, and the younger named Zhengxing, 14 years old, who is being tutored at home. Xu is well aware that he has held prominent positions. In view of the rampant kidnapping in Shanghai, he specially purchased two cars as a precaution to avoid the attention of bandits.</p>
<p>Yesterday in a Small Roadster: Xu's two cars are a new Buick sedan, Concession No. 10199 (City No. 5392), and an old-fashioned light gray Austin roadster, Concession No. 7256 (City No. 1366). Xu usually takes the sedan when attending formal banquets. When going to the bank for office work, Xu usually takes the roadster. Yesterday happened to be the first month anniversary of Xu's eldest grandson, and many relatives and friends came to congratulate him. At around 9:00 yesterday morning, Xu took the roadster to the bank for office work, while the sedan remained at home to welcome guests.</p>
<p>Four Bandits Block the Car: At 10:15 AM, Xu's two sons, along with Lin Yongming (38 years old, Xu's fellow villager), an accountant at the Huiwentang Printing Bureau at No. 5 Henan Road, Xu Xingwu (40 years old), an accountant at Xu's residence, and a servant of Xu, along with the driver Zhu Shunyuan (36 years old, from Funing), a total of six people, went out in the sedan. As the car was leaving the alley to the east and approaching Chen Ruiyu's Shunyuan Cigarette and Paper Shop at No. 14 Rue Bédier corner, bandits suddenly emerged from a four-way intersection. One bandit with a gun first approached the servant, suspecting that he was the bodyguard. Another bandit threatened the driver.</p>
<p>Yuejie Police Officer's Gun is Seized: The driver and servant were dragged out of the car by the bandits. At that time, Yuejie Police Officer No. 262 was patrolling by and was about to draw his gun to help, but two bandits had already surrounded him, monitored him, and seized the gun he was wearing. Then, they all boarded the car, and one bandit drove north like a flight. The driver saw the car being seized and frantically shouted after it, watching as the car went east on Avenue Foch and then straight onto Avenue Edward VII. At that time, a business car happened to pass by, and the driver stopped it, explained the situation, and quickly got into the car and chased east at full speed. However, when he chased near the Great World, the No. 10199 car had disappeared.</p>
<p>Xu Fu's Two Sons Change Their Surnames: The driver had no choice but to rush back to tell the owner and report it to the French Police Station. The police chief used the telephone to notify all the police stations in the Public Concession and the districts and departments of the Public Security Bureau to pay attention to interception. Meanwhile, the car was handed over to the private detectives to be taken to a special agency for questioning. However, in less than an hour, while the police were interrogating the driver, Xu's two sons and the accountant Xu Xingwu were sent to the French Police Station by the Yangshupu Police Station. According to the accountant, the bandits questioned them in the car, first asking who Xu's two relatives were. The accountant said that one's surname was Zhang and the other's surname was Li, and they were going to Xu's residence to offer congratulations. The bandits did not suspect anything, but only paid attention to Lin Yongming.</p>
<p>Xu Fu's Business Card is Found: One bandit immediately searched Lin's body and found a business card of Xu Fu. He was overjoyed, thinking that he must be the president. When the car arrived near Dalian Bay Road, he drove out the rest of us and took Lin alone. The three of us rushed to report to the Yangshupu Police Station, thus escaping danger, etc. At around 12:00 noon, the French Police Station received a phone call from the Yangshupu Police Station saying that the No. 10199 car had been found in the middle of Lan Road. The French Police detectives and the driver Zhu Shunyuan took the car and rushed to the scene. It was indeed the car that had been seized, so they drove it back to Xu's residence.</p>
<p>The Accountant Has News of Leaving Danger: When our reporter heard the news, he went to Xu's residence to inquire. He only saw large and small cars parked at the entrance of the alley. The sound of firecrackers could be heard from inside the house. After the reporter submitted his card, the family member lowered his voice and said respectfully, "The president is busy and unable to see guests. The kidnapped person has nothing to do with the president, so there is no need to extend an interview." At this point, the reporter understood. He then went to Huiwentang to inquire. According to the staff of the bureau, Lin only has an income of 40 yuan per month. In his hometown, there are three sons, three daughters, a wife, and a mother who depend on him for their livelihood. He is not qualified to be kidnapped. He must have been taken by mistake. Finally, he said that he had heard that Lin had left danger, but where he is now and whether it is true remains to be proven.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Follow-up Report on the Hanyang Steamer Robbery <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>No Major Losses</p>
<p>The Robbers Did Not Abduct Anyone</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Hanyang steamer, which sailed from Shanghai to Nanhua, had 15 pirates mixed in. It was reported yesterday that they suddenly robbed the ship at sea near Nan'ao, near Xiamen. It is now known that after the ship was robbed, it was slightly tidied up and then sailed to Xiamen. Yesterday morning, the company received a telegram from Hanyang stating that the ship had arrived in Xiamen and was unloading cargo and will depart for Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Robbed Goods: This time, the pirates aimed to rob a large sum of cash. They were very disappointed when they realized they had boarded the wrong ship. They robbed passengers and cargo. It was found that the cargo loaded in Shanghai this time included 620 pieces of cotton yarn and foreign cloth, 710 pieces of native cloth, 600 pieces of cotton, and leather goods and cigarettes. After investigation, it was found that the robbed items were cotton yarn, piece goods, and part of the leather goods. The exact amount is not yet known and will be clear after the entire ship has been unloaded.</p>
<p>Telegraph Inquiry About Lost Goods: Yesterday, the company sent a telegram to Hanyang asking them to investigate the number of pieces and marks of the lost goods in order to notify the customers. As for the passengers who were robbed, it was reported that there were no major losses. Only the money and jewelry they were carrying were robbed. The crew and passengers were not kidnapped.</p>
<p>British Warship Pursues: After this incident, the British warship stationed in Hong Kong has dispatched a ship to pursue the pirates towards Dapeng Bay.</p>
<p>Continued Transport of Large Sums of Money: 6 million yuan in cash was transported from this port to Dalian. The shipment on board aroused the pirates' covetousness, resulting in the mistaken robbery of the Hanyang steamer. Yesterday, another large sum of 1,105,000 yuan in cash was loaded to Dalian. Originally, it was intended to load 1.4 million yuan, but because the purchase in Shanghai was incomplete, 221 boxes were loaded first, including 50 boxes loaded by two banks, totaling 250,000 yuan. The rest were transported by Nanrongji and are scheduled to be exported today.</p>

<p>The Bao Shan Road Tragedy Relief Association held its fourth Executive Committee meeting yesterday at No. 15 Tianji Lane, Bao Shan Road. Representatives from the Bookbinding Union, Military Uniform Union, Lawyers Association, Postal Workers Union, Pharmaceutical Union, Law Academy, Shanghai Theater Union, and others attended.

(3) The Municipal Party Committee's approval of the Postal Workers Union's inquiry as to whether You's case is appropriate should be sent to the Lawyers Association for detailed study of the meaning of the approval and a refutation. (4) The fact that Zhang Yaozeng, Sha Xunyi, and Zhu Shaowen defended You, the murderer, aroused public anger. A letter should be sent to the Lawyers Association to suspend their powers. The original letter is copied below:</p>
<p>To whom it may concern, lawyers should uphold the dignity of national law and protect the responsibility of human rights. Today, You Bolu obstructed the patriotic movement and shot and killed unarmed civilians. His heinous crime is unforgivable by national law. The people of the country are gnashing their teeth in pain, hating that they cannot spray his blood with their own hot blood. However, members of your association, Zhang Yaozeng, Sha Xunyi, and Zhu Shaowen, dared to assist the tyrant and even published debates with a stream of nonsense, saying that they could announce their good intentions to the people of the country. We ask, if they had a conscience, why would they defend a traitor, how could they see the faces of the 400 million compatriots, how could they comfort the wronged ghosts, and how could they face the disabled victims. The evidence of You's murder is already in hand, and the Party, government, and military have confirmed that he is cruel and brutal. He can be called a brother with Du Xuantai in Guangdong. Our association feels the grief of being treated like rabbits and foxes and embraces the anger of injustice. We are organizing the "Bao Shan Road Tragedy Relief Association" from all walks of life and appointing your association as an executive committee member, hoping that you will quickly warn Zhang Yaozeng, Sha Xunyi, and Zhu Shaowen to stop defending You and becoming the enemy of the masses.</p>

<p>Xiao Yinghua Forces Acceptance</p>
<p>Extortion Investigation: Handwriting Comparison</p>
<p>Hong Meiji, the owner of the Chunhe Yong woolen and foreign goods store at number 83 Dongqi Street, residing at number 22 Hongxing Lane, North Sichuan Road, received a threatening letter on the 16th of this month. The letter, bearing the name "Wuxia Group," was filled with extremely threatening language, intending to extort 10,000 yuan. It stated that if the money was to be delivered, a red paper should be posted at the store's entrance, and someone would come to negotiate. Hong ignored the letter. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 3 p.m., a Cantonese man named Xiao Yinghua came to Chunhe Yong with a box of cigarettes and two bottles of wine, claiming they were a gift from a Mr. Zhang to Boss Hong. The store staff informed Hong, who refused to accept them, stating he had no friend or relative named Zhang. He secretly sent a staff member, Ge Jianyun, to follow Xiao. Ge saw Xiao leave the store and head north, turning into Sima Road at Henan Road, then turning again to Jiangxi Road before circling back to Chunhe Yong on Dongqi Pan Street. He insisted Zhang required the gifts to be accepted. Hong opened the cigarette box and found no cigarettes, only a letter. He opened the letter and found another threatening message, along with a bullet. Hong reported this to Detective Huang Fusen, who arrested Xiao and detained him in the General Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Division. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case, stating the police were prosecuting according to Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations for Punishing Bandits and Article 370 of the Criminal Code. However, the case still required further investigation, and an extension was requested. Ge Jianyun and others then testified. When questioned, the defendant claimed Zhu asked him to deliver the items, and he didn't know what they were. He denied writing the letters. Judge Xu Jiashi then ordered the defendant to write numbers in court for handwriting comparison. After Xiao wrote them, Judge Xu questioned him further and then ordered the defendant back into custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<p>Zhi Fa, the abbot of Jing'an Temple, sued Zhi Wen, the former abbot who had been relieved of his duties, for gathering Chen Ze Wo, Yao Fuqing, Gu Tingfang, Sha Shouzhong, Feng Xie, Feng Guangjia, Wang Dezhang, Wang Yunzeng, and others, to disturb the temple and damage property. Zhi Wen and Chen Yao also sued for illegal detention and obstruction. The dispute between the two sides was fierce, with multiple court sessions and inquiries. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefei mediated the dispute in court, advising Zhi Fa, as the abbot of a large temple, to be generous and tolerant, and that as a monk, he should be indifferent to worldly matters and endure everything. He suggested Yao Fuqing and others apologize orally to resolve the matter, considering their age. Zhi Fa initially refused, arguing that the matter was caused by the other party disturbing him and falsely accusing him, and that they should apologize. However, after Judge Xiao repeatedly persuaded him, and lawyers Wu Chengyu and Chen Ruixiang stated they respected the court's ruling, Zhi Fa stood up and respectfully apologized to the court. Chen Yao and others quickly left, thus ending the Jing'an Temple lawsuit that had stirred up society.</p>

<p>The bandit Ji Wenhua, from Sichuan, used a car with fake credentials to transport his accomplices Du Qi, Yu Hengdao, and others on the evening of the sixth of last month. They were armed and intended to rob a certain family's property in the Four Da Lane on Kangti Road in the French Concession. As the car stopped, before they could act, detectives Jin Jiulin, Li Yaolong, Qian Yumin, Mao Jingeng, Zhang Ziying, Bao Tan Qin Yu, and Zhou Buguang from the French Concession's special investigation unit arrived.

Qian was also connected to the case where Wu Yanfang, the accountant of the Ruikang Paint Store, was kidnapped and jumped to his death. They were sent to the Second Special District Court. After repeated interrogations by Judge Ge Zhitan, the defendants confessed to the robbery. The court appointed lawyers Xu Yannian and Shan Yuhua to provide pro bono defense for the defendants.

<p>Shen Yuanxing, a notorious bandit from Changzhou, had previously committed serious crimes such as kidnapping for ransom and armed robbery in his hometown with the already executed Qin Er.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>After Qin was arrested and executed, Shen fled to Shanghai, keeping his whereabouts secret, making it difficult to apprehend him. Ni, the captain of the Detective Team of the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau, learned that Shen had changed his name to Shu Wuda and was hiding at number 144 Fuqing Lane, Tangjia Lane, Shanghai. He immediately sent detectives to Shanghai to cooperate with the detectives of the public concession to go to the address and arrest Shen.

<h3 id="e157">Various Groups Emphasize Housing Disputes in Yixin Lane <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The housing dispute in the Yixin Lane area of Nanjing Road has now been brought to court, and a trial has been held once, with a postponement for retrial, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that since this case occurred, various groups in Shanghai have paid close attention to rental disputes. Because it is a time of internal and external troubles, the market is very depressed, but landlords and homeowners only care about their own interests, regardless of the suffering of others. Rent increases and forced evictions are common. This matter has a significant relationship with the housing rights of all citizens. If it is not corrected urgently, it is unimaginable what the disaster will be. More than 30 groups, including the Shanghai Citizens' Union First District Branch, plan to submit a large-scale petition to various agencies based on Shanghai's rental customs to avoid the suffering of all stores and residents in the city from having no houses to live in, and not to allow the total land ownership equalization for the benefit of the people to be destroyed by a few wealthy merchants.</p>

<p>Cutting Off Small Braids Suddenly Changes Appearance</p>
<p>Planning to Be Inducted Into a Brothel to Learn Prostitution</p>
<p>Gen Chang, the five-year-old daughter of Li Aliulu from Yancheng, residing at number 497 Gordon Road, disappeared at 1:30 PM on the 17th of this month while playing in front of the door. People were entrusted to search everywhere, but there was no news. Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Li Aliulu was passing through Miller Road when he saw Guo Sanyuan, a fellow townsman, holding his daughter and entering the house at number 678 on that road. He immediately reported this to the Chinese constables at number 2897 to enter together and arrest Guo. Together with the girl Gen Chang, they were taken to the head of the Hongkou Police Station, who ordered them to be detained. The girl was handed over to her father, Li Aliulu, to be taken back. Yesterday morning, the police sent Guo to the Criminal Division Two of the First Special Court. According to police lawyer Zhang Tianyin, the girl Gen Chang pointed out that the defendant had cut off the small braid she had been keeping on her head, changed her hairstyle, and changed her clothes. This was to sell her to a brothel to learn prostitution. Furthermore, the defendant had previously run a brothel, please postpone the investigation to see if there are any other cases, etc. Subsequently, the plaintiff, Li Aliulu, explained the situation, but the girl Gen Chang did not answer a word when asked because of the crowd in the courtroom. When questioned, the defendant's confession was vague, claiming that the girl was abducted by someone else, begging for consideration. After Shen Bingrong corroborated the confession, he ordered him to be remanded back into custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Printing Illegal Horseracing Lottery Tickets Sentenced <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Li Liansheng, the chief detective of the anti-gambling squad of the French Concession Police, and Liu Kunbao, the deputy detective, discovered that the Dongfang Printing House at number 548, Minquan Road, was illegally printing horseracing lottery tickets and selling them in the city, in violation of the prohibition. They went to the store and confiscated ten large and small printing plates, as well as hundreds of printed and unfinished lottery tickets. The owner, Zhang Yao, was arrested and taken to the police station. Also, the related persons Dai Laowu and Sun Houcheng were apprehended. They were sent to the Simple Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer prosecuted them for the crime of privately issuing lottery tickets under Article 281 of the Criminal Code. After repeated interrogations by Judge Zhang Shijie, Yao confessed that Dai Laowu had entrusted her to print them, and she did not know whether they were genuine or fake. Dai confessed that someone had entrusted him to print them and then handed them over to Sun Houcheng to send them to Nanchang twice. Sun also admitted to sending them on behalf. The court ordered them to be detained and to apprehend accomplices who were still at large for a combined investigation. Yesterday, they were interrogated again. The police lawyer stated that the accomplices who were at large had not yet been apprehended and requested a preliminary judgment. Judge Zhang questioned the two defendants again, and their confessions were the same as before. He immediately pronounced judgment in court. Dai Laowu was sentenced to two months of imprisonment for mediating the sale of lottery tickets that had not been approved by the government. Sun Houcheng was sentenced to 30 days of detention for mediating the sale of lottery tickets that had not been approved by the government.

<p>Director Guo to Go to Beijing to Ask for Instructions Soon</p>
<p>A Ceremony to Be Held on New Year's Day Next Year</p>
<p>Since Guo Biao, the director of the Central Mint, received repeated telegram orders from Finance Minister Song Ziwen to prepare for the start of work, the internal machinery has been instructed by the engineer to repair and install separately, and is waiting for Minister Song's order to start casting. The reporter of the New Voice Society went to the factory yesterday to inquire about the latest news on the preparation of the cast, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Guo Will Go to Beijing for Instructions: All the machinery of the factory has been repaired and installed by Guo, and notices have been posted to inform the workers to wait for the starting date. However, Guo needs to report to Minister Song in Beijing on the preparation process and ask for instructions on everything. It has now been decided to leave for Beijing in a few days, which will take about a week, and then return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Starting Date Has Been Decided: Regarding the starting date, it was previously rumored to be implemented within this year. It is now heard that this news is not true. The person in charge of the factory once told the reporter that a large number of silver bars have not yet been shipped from the United States, and it is difficult to hope to start casting within this year. It has now been decided by Minister Song to hold a casting ceremony on New Year's Day next year, and officially start work on the fifth. Minister Song will personally visit the factory at that time to participate in the ceremony, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Workers at Datong Bookstore Still Did Not Resume Work Yesterday <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Arrested Workers Have Been Fined and Released by the Court</p>
<p>The Company Will Recruit New Workers</p>
<p>Four Offices Have Issued a Declaration in Support</p>
<p>After the general strike of all employees of Datong Bookstore, the Party and government organs jointly issued a notice, ordering the resumption of work within three days, or it would be regarded as voluntary dismissal, and the company was allowed to recruit new workers to supplement the vacancies. Yesterday was the third day, and the employees insisted on not resuming work because the salary conditions were still not resolved. The arrested worker Xu Xinong was sentenced by the First Special District Court yesterday, fined 20 yuan and released. It is heard that the company is preparing to recruit new workers to replace the workers who refused to obey the order to resume work.</p>
<p>The Business, China, World, and Minzhi four offices issued a declaration in support of the Datong Bookstore workers' strike, saying: All Shanghai printing workers, under the heavy oppression of foreign imperialism and domestic capitalists, we are busy all day long, without enough food and clothing. In addition, the long-term chaos of domestic politics in recent years, exorbitant taxes, endless exploitation, soldiers, bandits, and plagues have come one after another. Our workers' lives are suffering to the point of being unbearable, and capitalists are even more recklessly exploiting their private desires, extending working hours, reducing wages, and dismissing workers. Therefore, it is impossible for us workers to maintain a minimum standard of living, so improving our lives is an urgent need for all workers in the country. The Datong Bookstore workers have been asking the capitalists to improve their treatment for several months in order to maintain their livelihoods. But the Datong Bookstore capitalists first dealt with it perfunctorily, then shirked responsibility, and now they dare to openly refuse, and threaten the workers' leaders to leave the factory, and even publicly announce that they will dismiss a large number of workers. Datong workers have no choice but to take strike action to deal with the capitalists, which is the action that Datong workers should take, and it is also the thing that all Shanghai printing workers urgently need to support. The strike has now been going on for six days, and the Datong capitalists have no sincerity to resolve the conditions, arrest workers, fabricate facts, post notices, and publish them in various newspapers to confuse public opinion and conspire to destroy the unity of the workers and deprive the workers of the benefits they deserve. Therefore, all the workers in our four offices are in the same class and share the same interests, so it is necessary to actively support them. We should use the united strength of more than 6,000 workers to fight the Datong capitalists. All Shanghai printing workers, we should know that the glorious and arduous struggle of Datong workers to improve their lives is the same as our struggle for the liberation of all printing workers. It is the first voice of our printing workers' liberation movement. Success or failure is of great importance to the future of printing workers' lives. We should all come forward to support, contribute money to help, publicize and call on, all of which are the tasks of every printing worker. The workers of our four offices will make the greatest efforts to support the Datong workers to achieve the final victory. It is hoped that all Shanghai printing workers will continue to support us and be a backing for the Datong workers. All Shanghai printing workers, hurry up and support the Datong striking workers. At the same time, it is especially hoped that all Shanghai printing workers will not be employed by the capitalists before the Datong conditions are resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Suichang Matches Are Indeed Domestic Products <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Lishui Suichang Match Company's factory name has one character that happens to be the same as the Japanese-owned Suisheng Match Company operating in Zhenjiang, causing the Liu Hai, Shenzhou, Ku Cang, Fisherman, etc., brand matches sold by Suichang Company in Xiamen to be mistakenly identified as Japanese goods and detained by the Xiamen Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. This was because Xiamen is far away in southern Fujian, and the situation is unclear. Furthermore, the coincidental similarity of the "Sui" character led to the misunderstanding. Upon further investigation, all kinds of goods produced by the Suichang Match Company, except for a small number of packaging papers and chemicals like potassium chlorate and red phosphorus, which must be supplied by countries such as England, America, Germany, and Switzerland (as these few types are not produced domestically), the remaining dozen or so medicinal materials are indeed entirely domestic products, and half of them are local products of Lishui, not requiring external sourcing. In particular, the bulk raw materials such as matchbox pieces and matchsticks are supplied by the local Puchang Matchbox and Stick Factory. Therefore, the products are of excellent quality, not inferior to imported goods.</p>

<p>District 1: The Shanghai Citizens' First District Branch yesterday sent a telegram to the National Government, requesting severe punishment for Wang Shuchang and Wan Fulin's son, Wan Guobin. The telegram stated: "To Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government, as the violent Japanese are gaining ground inch by inch, recently attacking Heihe and harassing Tianjin, local officials should be firm in resisting the enemy and protecting the country and its soil. However, Wang Shuchang is timid and pro-Japanese, betraying the country's rights and humiliating the nation, while Wan Guobin took advantage of the chaos to abscond, losing his mind and going crazy. We implore you to order Deputy Commander Zhang of Peiping to severely punish them nearby and order Wan Fulin to hand over his son and the embezzled public funds in full, in order to rectify national principles and appease public opinion. The telegram is sent urgently, awaiting your orders." It also sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Economic Severance Committee, questioning the meaning of the measures for disposing of confiscated Japanese goods. The letter stated: "Respectfully informing you, on November 15th, a letter was sent, which stated: 'We believe that the measures for disposing of Japanese goods contained in Announcement No. 2 of your committee on November 12th seem inappropriate. At this time when a great enemy is at our doorstep and national humiliation has not been avenged, how can partial pain affect the national patriotic movement and cause foreign countries to laugh at us? Moreover, after the announcement of the measures for disposing of Japanese goods, what methods will be used to prevent unscrupulous merchants from taking the opportunity to sell Japanese goods, and what kind of abuses will result? We ask your esteemed committee to consult and lead, and we assume that there will be no difference in the steps towards jointly facing national crisis. Therefore, we have specially sent this letter for your review, hoping that you will clearly explain the meaning of the publicly announced Announcement No. 2 to dispel public doubts. The urgency cannot be expressed fully.' etc. This letter was sent, and there should have been a receipt, so it must have reached the record room long ago, but we have not yet received a reply, which is very surprising. Therefore, we are re-extracting the original letter as follows, asking you to promptly review and reply, and please do not delay any further."</p>

Because the matter was illegal and resembled fraudulent deception, they refused to bribe him and sternly refused. The next day, Lin Shan led four police officers from the Third Precinct of the Fifth District and forcibly drove away 51 jars of native yellow wine. Inspector Wang issued a receipt, but the wine was nowhere to be found and was not in the Third Precinct of the Fifth District. This hinders business and causes huge losses. He requested active negotiation.

<p>Announcement: Since October 22nd, this column has raised four questions to solicit opinions, namely (1) regarding the League of Nations, (2) regarding boycotting Japanese goods, (3) regarding volunteer army, (4) regarding uniting people's hearts to deal with foreign enemies. In the past month, many replies have been received. Those that have been published in this column include Mr. Lin Yifang, Mr. Liu Boyong, Mr. Zhongxia, and Mr. Zheng Hongsheng's opinions on boycotting Japanese goods, Mr. Qingyuan's opinion on the volunteer army, and Mr. Ding Jichan's opinion on uniting together to deal with foreign enemies, all of which have great value. In addition, there are quite a few others that could not be published due to space limitations. Now that the situation has changed drastically, the national crisis is becoming more urgent, the League of Nations negotiations have completely failed, the bitter battle in Heilongjiang has finally fallen, and the disturbances in Tianjin continue unabated. In the midst of this precarious situation for China's national destiny, mere worry, anxiety, and impatience are useless. All of us citizens should stand up, muster deep courage, and rack our brains to come up with a relatively appropriate plan for the current major issues and contribute them to the authorities and the people. Now, please raise two questions as follows: (1) Japan's trampling on Heilongjiang and invading the Middle East route not only disregards our country's sovereignty but also provokes Soviet Russia. According to common sense, Soviet Russia can no longer tolerate it. If it joins the war, it will repeat the Russo-Japanese War of 27 years ago. At that time, what attitude should our country take towards Japan and Soviet Russia? If it involves European and American countries, how should we deal with each country? (2) Chairman Chiang of the National Government has decided to set off north in the near future to recover lost territories. This is of course what the national people are eagerly looking forward to. From now on, the overall situation will change dramatically. Regarding military preparations, the government is of course responsible. On the part of the people, what responsibilities should they fulfill and what work should they do? How should boycotting Japanese goods, training volunteer army, etc., be done better? Each answer should be limited to a maximum of 1,000 words. Say less empty words and focus on methods. This newspaper will select the best ones for disclosure and public discussion based on the capacity of this column. If you agree with the methods proposed by others, please also state your opinion. Please still provide your full name, gender, age, occupation, or place of study, and native place, and attach a communication stamp and a corresponding amount of postage stamps, so that those who are not published in the newspaper can be informed by letter. As for the three questions of study, occupation, and marriage, they will still be handled according to the usual procedures. Respectfully announced.</p>

<p>(Advocates donating confiscated Japanese goods for military expenses against Japan)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's proposed method of disposing of confiscated Japanese goods superficially protects merchants' hardships, but in reality, it eases the anti-Japanese sentiment. Currently, the violent Japanese invasion is becoming more urgent, and Heihe has been captured again. Although the League of Nations is meeting in Paris, it will definitely not be able to save China. Moreover, Japan's internal ideological problems are very serious. If it uses all its strength against us, a revolution will inevitably occur within the country. China's national spirit is now aroused and can be used. Armed recovery of the lost territories is indeed a good opportunity to save the country. However, the expenses for weapons, ammunition, and provisions are extremely high. If the confiscated Japanese goods are donated to cover military expenses, it would greatly help in recovering the lost territories. Our country does not lack generals, nor does it lack soldiers, but it lacks provisions and ammunition. The confiscated Japanese goods in Shanghai already amount to more than 20 million yuan. If more are added from other ports, it would be more than enough for two months of military expenses. Merchants love the country and do not fall behind. What do the gentlemen of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce think?</p>
<p>(Answer) The method of disposing of confiscated Japanese goods has been detailed in yesterday's reply to Mr. Zhang Liyang and Mr. Li-Shi's News. Please review it.</p>

<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast for yesterday at 4:30 p.m. stated that the Yangtze River basin and coastal areas will be cloudy and colder, with occasional rainfall in some areas. A north wind is strengthening over Shandong and the Yellow Sea. The wind in the East Sea is erratic. There is a cyclone in Kyushu due to the passage of a low-pressure area moving northeast. The weather is bad east of Luzon. The center of the hurricane was within 120 miles of the intersection of 18.4 degrees north latitude and 129 degrees east longitude at 2:00 p.m., appearing to stall. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the highest temperature in Shanghai was 63.0 and the lowest was 56.3.

<p>Sir, on the 20th of this month, I read in the newspaper that Feng Yongchang of the Peichang Company and broker Hua Jinzhang had violently beaten members of the Anti-Japanese Association and snatched their badges. This does not conform to the facts. Upon investigation, the members of the Anti-Japanese Association were conducting an inspection, and Mr. Feng and Mr. Hua explained the matter to them, but there was absolutely no violent beating of members or snatching of badges. Recently, because the matter involves discrepancies, we have no choice but to truthfully inform your newspaper and ask you to publish it in the "Letter to the Editor" section to clarify the truth of the day and avoid misunderstandings. We would be extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted to the chief editor of the Shenbao by Peichang Iron Company on November 21st, the Republic of China (Year 20).</p>

<p>Liangchen Haoyou Society, located at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road, declares that, in order to assist the anti-Japanese movement, the society has produced "Anti-Japanese Stationery," printed on Yuzhu paper, eight columns wide, 100 sheets per bag, with ten kinds of anti-Japanese illustrations, and printed on the stationery in Imitation Song typeface are the words "Compatriots quickly rise up to resist Japan and save the country." The original price is 35 cents, now reduced to 28 cents; wholesale price is only 2.5 yuan per thousand sheets. Sales start today. Many businesses and organizations have placed bulk orders for gifts and commemorative items. In addition, Zhang Zhenlu, a famous calligrapher of the society, is sacrificing his paper and ink to raise funds to support Heihe. Those who donate 10 yuan will receive a five-foot couplet, and those who donate 100 yuan will receive another piece of calligraphy of their choice. The society will handle the remittance. Mr. Zhang issued a declaration yesterday, saying, "The Japanese bandits are invading, the borderlands are falling, I grieve for my surviving compatriots, telegrams and letters are flying about, lamenting that the end is near. Alas, these great old men, although the war letters are urgent, they remain unopened. Only General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang, single-handedly guarding the pass, is struggling to defend the isolated army, making a proper defense and thwarting the ferocious power of the victor. The city will fall with the man, the people's will is the general's will, which is enough to be called a good leader who protects the country and appeases the people. Is there no shame for the senior officials of the border defense command? Yinghuan admires his public service and loyalty, and national history will shine for it. Such rare talents will naturally be followed by the whole country. How can we, with the heart of a wolf, bear to watch the fire from across the river? I am a humble scholar, with a meager life of three feet, willing to relieve the difficulties, but unable to destroy the family. I can barely write official documents, and I also think of going to war and brandishing a spear, but I am powerless to tie a chicken, and in the end, I am just a scholar carrying a plan. I only think that in the icy and snowy frontier, we need food and drink, so I donate paper and ink and widely give away calligraphy couplets. All the donations received will be used for remittances. I will do my best and it does not matter if I break my arm. Wielding a brush is like a thousand-man army, and collecting small contributions will build a strong fortress. Alas, who has no ancestors, who has no wife and children, who has no descendants? We should all be quick to take the lead, and eagerly empty our pockets to protect our divine and glorious youth. People are not plants, people are not iron and stone, people are not deer and pigs. Faced with this urgent crisis, hesitating and preserving our eggs is willingly becoming a slave of a fallen nation. Let us see the unanimous support of the people's hearts and virtues, and make it a prelude to the government's dispatch of troops. How regrettable, let us arise and act!"</p>
