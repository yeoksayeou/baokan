<p>（日内瓦）　國聯行政會今日午後四時開會、以便通過以英法意德四國代表組合的國聯特别委員會今晨密議所擬定關於滿洲事件之議案、行政會後即閉會至十月十四日復開、但議定如日軍全體已退出佔據區域、而中日間直接談判業已進行、則行政會可不於十月十四日復開、提會議案已經各方接受、議案中載有中日兩國致行政會勸令和平解决之覆文、日政府所發否認日本欲呑併滿洲土地之聲明、日本正式宣佈撤回佔據區域内日軍之聲明、中政府對於南滿鐵路區域外日人生命財產擔保責任之聲明、及中日兩國允採行種種方法、以免時局愈臻嚴重之擔保、行政會議案原文如下、</p>
<p>（一）本會議長閲悉中日兩政府答本會所發迫切請求之覆文、及其依允此項請求而已採行之步驟、</p>
<p>（二）本會承認日政府所稱日本在滿洲並無土地目的一節之重要、</p>
<p>（三）本會備悉日代表所稱日軍之撤退刻在進行中、日政府意欲依日僑生命財產之安全、獲有切實擔保之比例、繼續儘速將其軍隊撤回至鐵路區域、日政府希望能以在可能範圍内、儘量儘速實行此意各節、</p>
<p>（四）本會備悉中代表所稱中政府在日軍撤退及中國地方官與警察恢復之際、擔負鐵路區域外日僑生命財產安全之責任一節、</p>
<p>（五）本會確知中日兩政府皆亟欲避免可擾亂兩國間和平與良好諒解之任何行動、並悉中日兩國代表已發宣言、聲明其政府將採行各種必要方法、以免滿洲事件範圍之擴大、或時局之愈臻緊張、　　（六）本會請雙方各盡其力、促成兩國間尋常關係之恢復、繼續並從速完成以上各述諒解之實施、以恢復尋常關係、</p>

<p>日代表芳澤接受行政會議案、至於以消息供給行政會一層、芳澤提議行政會各會員應設法將其政府所接到滿洲傳來之任何消息、送交國聯秘書長、中代表施肇基聲稱、中政府欣然依允行政會徵求消息之請求、渠希望不幸的時局可早日結束、渠知行政會在此事上所加於中國之職務、渠又表關於十月十四日行政會集議之議案、渠希望是時日軍將業已撤完、否則行政會勢必另有辦法、而應遣中立國人所組合之委員會前往滿洲就地設法監視撤兵、但渠希望在十月十四日以前滿洲原狀當已恢復、中國保留國聯會章所賦予關於解决此項衝突之一切權利、渠據此保留、接受行政會議案云、芳澤稱、渠不能接受施博士所發之解釋、渠代表日政府接受原有形式之議案云、議長勒樂聲艢、議案如原擬之形式、並無解釋問題云、勒樂旋宣佈休會至十月十四日、此間對於今日會議之批評、以爲中日衝突暫時如此處置、行政政及國聯中人皆覺國聯行政會休會⊙北平日軍演習野戰⊙（見國外要電）英皇批准減政案⊙德國社會民主黨内訌⊙（見國外要電）寶山路警察開槍發生慘案⊙（見本埠新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c17">國聯之成績如此 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>當日軍實施武裝襲我東北之暴行發生。正值國際聯盟舉行當會。此種公然背棄盟約破壞和平之行動吾人固明知對國聯不能存若何奢望但以爲國聯爲維持其本身之生命。計最低限度。亦應予以應急之阻止。以使暴行不至繼續擴大。然而截至今日。事實行證實國聯終無以維持其威信與生命。即起碼限度之工作。亦未能做到。彼集合合各國代表斷斷以議。侃侃而論。道貎儼然之國聯議會蓋適爲一齣合串之滑稽喜劇。而其所標榜之「公理」「和平。」亦適爲欺騙弱者之糖果。質言之。國聯蓋大而無當之紙老虎耳。　　自九月十八日日軍實施武力發動暴軍即紛紛四出。加緊策進。鐵蹄到處。我山河即隨之而列易顏色。人民旣陷於塗炭。東北壁。蹂躙殆徧。延至九月二十二日國聯始發出極其滑稽之要求兩國立即撤兵之緊急通知。中國駐兵本國國土。以日軍襲擊旣已一撤再撤。撤而不及。仍不免於繳械與槍殺誠如國聯所通知。中國軍隊究將撤至何處。吾人於彼時蓋已懷疑於國聯之終將無以實行其最低限度之工作使紙老虎不至遽爾戳穿　　而今則何如。國聯理事會已於昨日閉會矣。在上月二十八日國聯議會末次大會上。主席勒樂聲稱。「中日間滿洲事變。不幸以理事會最大之努力。迄猶未得解决惟理事會信任日本不貪中國土地。及日軍在可能上儘速撤回滿鐵附屬地之宣言深信雙方之善意與中日政府間之直接交涉將爲達到最後解决之最妙方法」同時復聲稱。「理事會將繼續促進此種方法。直至獲得解决而後已。」復宣佈「行政會議爲辦理中日問題。會議將延長數日。當可堅南京政府之努力。以約束激烈。主張而成就和平解决一至昨日理事會閉幕復决議「通告日本希望日本從本日起至十月四日止將在滿日軍撤退原地。」妙哉勒樂之言。妙哉國聯理事會之决議。委婉圓滑。面面周到。旣不開罪於桀敖倔强之日本。復爲中國留一綫不絶之「希望」臨去秋波嬌媚兩面。集各國政治家外交家於堂有此圓滑周到之議案。震撼世界之大變。竟極輕輕應付過去國聯諸公應亦可以自豪矣。</p>
<p>抑吾人仍有未能已於言者。（一）理事會深信日本不貪中國土地。及日軍在可能人儘速撤回滿鐵附屬地吾人誠不解此種絶對冒險之信任。有何保障。設使日人雖不貪中國土地而長時佔據。設使日軍撤退不可能儘速設使朝撤退而夕又進據。國聯其將何以自解更將何以自處（二）如中日政府可以直接交涉則在日軍暴行未發動之先。可以不直接交涉今破我門戶。據我堂奥。屠我人民刦我財帛抑且狂暴之行迄未稍戢。乃重言兩國直接交涉在日人固可以躊躇滿志矣而在我國則何異於城下之盟。國聯所謂「中日政府間之直接交涉爲達到最後解决之最妙方法。」助長兇焰蹂躙弱國。娋則妙矣其如中國四萬萬人民之不能忍受何至於議會主席鐵士萊斯科登宣稱「議會尙無必須干涉中日間危局或討論理事會處置之表示。」更爲吾人所大惑不解夫日軍之暴行。不僅爲中日間危局蓋　彰彰綦明。暴力襲擊佔據土地。換易旗幟設置官廳屠戮人民。事態嚴重至此。尙謂一議會尙無必須干涉。」然則必至若何地步始必須干涉半月以來日軍之暴行。事實昭彰。我方代表在會議上正式提出一經日方代表事認。國聯即予以否認我方代表提出行政會應參助中日兩國談判。經日方代表反對。國聯即予否决俔俔伈伈。處處惟日人之馬首是瞻吾人眞不解國聯今後將何以自存將何以自解。　　國聯今已閉會矣日人之暴行則如故也截至四日撤退日軍之希望萬一不能實現以後之問題國聯是否亦曾思及也</p>

<p>這幾天來，學生要罷課，校長不要罷課。這種矛盾怕是出於誤　　會吧？依找看來，學校有平時之課，有戰時之課。校長與學生應該好商好量的定出一個合理而有實效的辦法來。我想那合理而有實效的辦法是：</p>
<p>「罷平時之課，上戰時之課。」</p>
<p>虎狼已經進了房子吃人，做先生的不敎孩子們拿眞本領去援救親姊妹，却要他們照舊詩云，子曰的讀死書，那就算是不知時務了。做孩子的不滿意於先生之鎭靜，赤手空拳，東奔西走，瞎喊救命，嘴兒喊乾的時候，家人已經死得精光，自己也不免要飽虎狼的口腹了。這也算是不長進。那末如何是好？平時的功課雖要罷，戰時的功課必須上。而且要上這戰時的功課的人，不但是學生凡是國民，都應當立刻上起戰時之功課。戰時的功課不是喊幾句口號的愛國八股，也不是使個木頭槍兒學一些立正開步走的武八股。我們必須上戰時之眞功課以　得應戰之眞本領。</p>
<p>戰時的功課是什麽？</p>
<p>（一）男子用眞武器武裝起來學緊急戰；（二）女子用眞武器武裝起來學看護：（三）宣傳並實行對日經濟絶交：（四）研究中日貿易（五）振興替代日貨　實業與工業；（六）研究日本（七）研究東三省（八）研究國際大勢；（九）專攻自然科學以立造產與國防之基礎；（十）厲行民衆識字運動使知中華民國是四萬萬人共有共治　享共保之國家；（十）（一）厲行小學之科學敎育，造就科學的兒童以建設二十年後之科學的中國使中國永遠立於不敗之地；（十）（二）恢復水災土地俾能及時下種以足民食。　　這十二門功課必須按着各人的性質分工合作的幹起來。從今日起我們便須自己問自己：</p>
<p>「如果今天晚上日本强盜來到，我們如何將他打敗？」</p>
<p>這個問題不是出於幻想。瀋陽便是如此落的。日本軍隊旣能如此來佔瀋陽，也能如此來佔租界外的上海，來佔中國公學，來佔恒豐紗廠，來佔眞茹村，來佔徐公橋，我們還是效法張學良之避免衝突，還是效法史可法之背城一戰？您該立刻快定。</p>
<p>到了今日，政府必須信民衆，信民衆有救國的力量。政府必須排除一切疑慮帮助民衆武裝起來，造成只禦外侮不參内戰的偉大的義勇自衛軍。如果還要夢想拿一個　武裝民衆作後盾之政府與鐵血主義之日本相抗衡，那是必無倖存之理。生死關頭，近在眼前，不必多話，武裝起來，幹！</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>對日經濟絶交。必須堅持到底。這兩句高調。誰都會唱然而過去的經騐告我們歷次抵　　制日貨總是虎頭蛇尾。不曾能制日本人的死命誠是萬分遺憾的在日本人心裡想「支那人的抵制。不過五分鐘熱度。」唉我們自己露馬脚。紙老虎給他們拆穿了。還有什麽話呢但是今次事　的嚴重。不比從前。國人態度的堅决的匯進步得多了。現在我們對過去有始無終不澈底的抵制。應該表示追悼。從今而後。四萬萬同胞。大家立在青天白日之下。閉目思過。捫着自己的心坎。默念三聲「我倘如再買日本貨。我便不是人。罪該萬死。」抵制日貨。旣是四萬萬人共同的决心。也得預防作弊。所以我自己堅定宗旨了。對於别人。還要互相勸勉督責。萬衆一心始終不渝。纔能達到我們的目標。至於抵制開始以後。要有具體的辦法。以作準繩。下列幾條。可供參考。</p>
<p>（一）各地抗日救國會。應成爲永久的機關。嚴密組織。上下一貫。可以仿照國民黨的組織系統。　在首都或上海成立全國總會。各省組分會。各縣組支會。在短期問内開全國代表大會。决定一切、</p>
<p>方針。實行對日經濟絶交的總動員令。</p>
<p>（二）上海先籌設日貨陳列館。把所有各種日本貨。陳列起來。由各商號自動把剩餘日貨送夫做標本。或者抗日會把破獲的日貨。統送到陳列館。務使所有日貨。應有盡有。這種貨品。應詳細標明他的出產地、製造法、用途和價格。如有國貨代用品。應當註明。否則暫且以歐美出品作附註（三）日貨陳列館成立後。完全開放并可以舉行仇貨展覽會一則使大家知道日貨的本來而目。不再混爲國貨及西洋貨。二則可以給工業家作爲研究改良的張本。三則企業家知道那一種最需要的日用貨品。先行設廠制造。這些意義是非常深遠的。</p>
<p>（四）商人應受自己良心的制裁。愼防國民的處分。澈底覺悟。勿再勿再買賣日貨。但我已探得兩件不幸的事實。有幾個漢奸。暗中正托外商批進滅絶標識廉價的日貨。轉向外商買進。用間接販　的方法。貪圖私利。也有幾家洋貨店。日來正大拍賣日貨。這種冷血動物。眞該天誅地滅。抗日會怎麽不去嚴密澈究呢</p>
<p>（五）我們抵制日貨。不但從本身起。而且要竭力向民間宣傳。雖是窮鄉僻壤。也當家諭戶曉。其實窮鄉僻壤到是通用國貨。不過趁這機會散佈抗日救國的空氣於民間。（六）擴大宣傳。方法也很多。如一·制定不買日貨的微章。人人佩帶二·各大城市放汽球標語。浮動天空。最使人注目。三·市場中心車站碼頭之旁樹立標語牌。注重救國圖畫。四各種車輛加貼標語。五·郵局於函件上加蓋抗日救國印章。信箋。信封也同様。（七）不再雇用日人。亦不被日人雇用。抱定絶對不合作主義。日本商行、没有華人去充買辦、行員、跑銜。乾詭的話。中國人不再做他們的走狗。日貨自然無從推銷。同時杜絶日貨的進口和出路。這幾點做到。抵制的效果。已有七分成熟了。再要决心不坐日本的火車輪船。那末在日人掌握中的南滿鐵路及其侵佔我們外海内河航業權的南華、北洋、長江班日輪。空來空去。必致完全頓停。這麽一來。最後的勝利。還是歸於我們的。　　短訊海上串商票社同人。爲振濟水災。擇於本星訊日（即四日　）假座人舞台演劇。以所得劇資悉充賑　。其劇目　戴玉麟吳老圃之黃金台。李能傳龔兆熊之連環套。趙培鑫曹亮　之四盤山。董正清之艶陽樓。郭　　之追韓信。薛良君之南陽關。施芸英朱如英二女士之能仁寺。李白水之全本奇寃報。均爲傑作云。</p>

<p>才進了禪室，分賓主而坐；便覺行一陣的芋香，直透鼻觀，　　好像恰才出鍋般。小沙彌進了一杯釅釅的茶；陶遲手托着茶杯，環視那禪室中的種種布置，眞個是一塵不染；除却經卷鐘磐應有盡有以外，中間設着一張千年樹根製造的獨座椅子，椅背上刻着三字古隸，取名呌做「」轉輪椅　；這便值得陶遲的暗暗奇怪：　　「這張椅子，怎麽呌做轉輪椅呢？輪都没有，只是塊然不動的放在這裏，一百年也不會轉。」</p>
<p>長老已猜出了陶遲的意思：</p>
<p>「居士，你是不是奇怪着這張轉輪椅子？你以爲千年樹根不會轉動的；誰知不動則已，一動時，比着地球自轉的速度，還得快過千萬倍，這是一張不可思議的轉輪椅子！」</p>
<p>「老和尙　你説話端的是不可思議。」</p>
<p>「居士不信，少頃，便可以請你實騐這張不可思議的轉輪椅子。」　　一僧一俗談話時，小沙彌已捧進一盤熱騰騰地恰才出鍋的芋艿。長老便請陶遲，嘗嘗這香積廚中的風味；陶遲跑了許多路，五臓神呈坐着轉輪椅子在嗚嗚地發聲；長老請他嘗嘗這香積廚中的風味，他便老實不客氣的一壁剥芋一壁和長老講話：</p>
<p>「居士騎着快馬，跑來跑去，作麽生？」　　「老和尙，這般時局，呌我跑到那裏去；眞個是我瞻四方，蹙蹙靡所騁。」　　「居士開口，便説消極話，作麽生？」　　「老和尙，「我生不辰，逢天癉怒；」不消極·」　　「居士，你説我生不辰，」老僧問你，生在什麽時候，	你才滿意？」</p>
<p>「老和尙，未來的黃金時代，杳杳無期，我也不想了；我只想的是過去時代。一般輿論，總是這般説：丨中國的國勢，代不如代了丨二十世紀的中國，不如十九世紀；十九世紀的中國，不如十八世紀。老和尙，此説若確，我恨生得太遲了，要是生十八世紀太平無事的時代，在　鼓吹休明中度我的有涯之生，我便滿意了：但是，「百川東到海，何日復西師？」年光和流水一般，只是順流而下絶對不肯同頭的；國泰民安的中國已成了歷史上的陳跡，現在是什麽局面呢？不消極，也消極。</p>

<p>在四圍山色和海光、沃野無　、恒河中臥的大地上、其人民在十五世紀前、生息敎養、終日以戀愛畋獵爲事、優哉游哉、窮年盡日的享受着得天獨厚的幸福、便產生以心靈爲本位的一切文化、釋迦牟尼應運而生其間、殊不足怪、十七世紀後、這塊佳地、突變而爲一塊肥肉、不斷的遭逢着割裂刀爼之慘刑、三萬萬的人民、從此便心爲形役、靈爲　秀的一步步的墜落於深淵之底、</p>

<p>可是沈没蹂躪在大英帝國的鐵蹄之下、數百年來的佛的後人、這幾十年來、也跟着這班後輩、因爲不自競存、以致没落的國家、而同聲嚷着自治、嚷着獨立、偉大的聖人的甘地、在國民含涙而呼天的中間、𡢃𡢃的走出世來、�</p>

<p>(Beiping) At 10:00 AM this morning, more than 40 Japanese soldiers conducted offensive and defensive tactics exercises in the open space and woods of East Chang'an Street, holding guns, aiming, shooting, charging, and dueling, with lifelike movements. During the attack, they even crossed the border to Dongdan Arch, disrupting traffic for a time. Chinese people were extremely angry. The Public Security Bureau sent Secretary Ji Shi'an to investigate this action by the Japanese army, which was clearly a provocation. Police were dispatched to provide strict protection. The Japanese army did not return to the Japanese barracks until 1:00 PM. Although China has repeatedly made representations to the Japanese Embassy to stop this, the Japanese army has actually crossed the border again to conduct field exercises in densely populated areas, and their intentions are clear.

<p>Announced the previous day</p>
<p>A Resolution of Mere Perfunctory Discussion</p>
<p>Will Reconvene on the 14th</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council met at 4:00 PM today to pass the resolution on the Manchuria incident drafted by the League of Nations Special Committee composed of representatives from Britain, France, Italy, and Germany, which had a secret meeting this morning. The Administrative Council will then adjourn until October 14th, but it was agreed that if all Japanese troops have withdrawn from the occupied areas and direct negotiations between China and Japan have begun, the Administrative Council may not reconvene on October 14th. The proposed resolution has been accepted by all parties. The resolution contains the replies of China and Japan to the Administrative Council's exhortation to peaceful resolution, the Japanese government's statement denying Japan's intention to annex Manchurian territory, the Japanese government's formal declaration to withdraw Japanese troops within the occupied areas, the Chinese government's statement of responsibility for the safety of Japanese lives and property outside the South Manchuria Railway area, and the guarantees of China and Japan to take various measures to prevent the situation from becoming more serious. The original text of the Administrative Council resolution is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The President of this Council has read the replies of the Chinese and Japanese governments to the urgent request issued by this Council and the steps taken to comply with this request.</p>
<p>(2) This Council recognizes the importance of the Japanese government's statement that Japan has no territorial intentions in Manchuria.</p>
<p>(3) This Council notes the statement of the Japanese representative that the withdrawal of Japanese troops is currently underway and that the Japanese government intends to continue to withdraw its troops to the railway area as quickly as possible in proportion to the reliable guarantees of the safety of Japanese lives and property. The Japanese government hopes to implement this intention to the greatest extent possible as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>(4) This Council notes the Chinese representative's statement that the Chinese government assumes responsibility for the safety of Japanese lives and property outside the railway area during the withdrawal of Japanese troops and the restoration of Chinese local officials and police.</p>
<p>(5) This Council is aware that both the Chinese and Japanese governments are eager to avoid any actions that could disrupt peace and good understanding between the two countries, and is aware that representatives of China and Japan have issued declarations stating that their governments will take all necessary measures to prevent the expansion of the Manchuria incident or the exacerbation of the situation. (6) This Council requests both parties to make every effort to promote the restoration of normal relations between the two countries and to continue and promptly complete the implementation of the above-mentioned understandings in order to restore normal relations.</p>
<p>(7) This Council requests both parties to provide this Council with complete information regarding the Manchuria incident on a regular basis.</p>
<p>(8) This Council decides that, unless an unexpected event occurs that requires this Council to convene immediately, it will convene in Geneva on Wednesday, October 14th, to consider the situation at that time.</p>
<p>(9) This Council authorizes the President, after consulting with his colleagues and the Chinese and Japanese representatives, to cancel the meeting of October 14th if he believes that, based on the information he receives from the Chinese and Japanese representatives or other members of the Administrative Council regarding the development of the situation, it is not necessary to convene the meeting on October 14th.</p>
<p>Japanese representative Yoshizawa accepted the Administrative Council resolution. Regarding the provision of information to the Administrative Council, Yoshizawa proposed that each member of the Administrative Council should find a way to send any information their government receives from Manchuria to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji stated that the Chinese government gladly complied with the Administrative Council's request for information. He hoped that the unfortunate situation could end soon. He knew the duties imposed on China by the Administrative Council in this matter. He also expressed his views on the resolution regarding the Administrative Council meeting on October 14th. He hoped that by that time, the Japanese troops would have been completely withdrawn, otherwise, the Administrative Council would have to take other measures and send a committee composed of people from neutral countries to Manchuria to supervise the withdrawal of troops on the spot. However, he hoped that the status quo in Manchuria would be restored before October 14th. China reserves all rights under the League of Nations Charter regarding the resolution of this conflict. Based on this reservation, he accepted the Administrative Council resolution. Yoshizawa said that he could not accept the interpretation issued by Dr. Shi. He accepted the resolution in its original form on behalf of the Japanese government. President Leroux declared that the resolution was in its original form and there was no question of interpretation. Leroux then announced the adjournment of the meeting until October 14th. The criticism here regarding today's meeting is that the Chinese-Japanese conflict has been temporarily handled in this way. The Administrative Council and people in the League of Nations feel that the League of Nations Administrative Council has adjourned. ⊙Japanese Army Conducts Field Exercises in Beiping⊙ (See Foreign Telegrams) ⊙British Emperor Approves Reduction of Political Cases⊙ ⊙Internal Strife in the German Social Democratic Party⊙ (See Foreign Telegrams) ⊙Tragic Incident of Police Shooting on Baoshan Road⊙ (See Local News)</p>

<p>To appease Shi Zhaoji, the following declaration was issued: Since the Japanese government has declared that it has no territorial intentions in Manchuria and has announced that it is now withdrawing a portion of Japanese troops from the occupied areas, and that the remainder will be withdrawn as soon as possible, and the Administrative Council has also learned in detail about the various events in this negotiation and is prepared to convene a meeting immediately when any event occurs after I request a meeting, I believe that I cannot firmly object to the adjournment until October 14th. Shi also said that after the Japanese troops have fully withdrawn and the original state has been restored, the Chinese government will continue to ask the League of Nations to assist in resolving the responsibility for the incident that occurred on September 18th and compensation for all losses. (Reuters Telegram on the 30th) (Nanjing) The Foreign Ministry received a telegram from the Chinese delegation in Geneva stating that the League of Nations Administrative Council met this afternoon. Chairman Leroux stated that guaranteeing peace is the natural duty of the League of Nations, but the withdrawal of troops to the South Manchuria Railway affiliated area will take a considerable amount of time, and it seems unnecessary to reconvene the meeting. It is now temporarily adjourned. The Administrative Council is extremely concerned about the Eastern Provinces incident, and will do its best to assist where needed. Yoshizawa stated that he accepted the resolution, but an on-the-spot investigation of the news was not necessary. Each Director of the Administrative Council could notify the Secretary-General of the League of Nations after receiving news from their own government. Shi Zhaoji stated that the Chinese government would definitely provide the League of Nations with various news items. He was satisfied that the League of Nations was willing to take responsibility for handling the matter. He hoped that the Japanese withdrawal of troops would be expedited and the previous situation would be fully restored. If the original state was not fully restored within 14 days, the Administrative Council should reconvene to discuss countermeasures. I had proposed that the investigation team handle the matter on the spot, which the Administrative Council could consider when it meets on the 14th. The Chinese government reserves the rights conferred by the League of Nations regulations and will reiterate its request that the Administrative Council review the responsibility and compensation of the parties involved. Based on the above understanding, I declared that I accepted the resolution, which was unanimously passed. The Administrative Council adjourned yesterday and will reconvene on the 14th. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Prime Minister Wakatsuki, upon receiving a telegram from League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond inquiring whether the Japanese government supports and verifies Yoshizawa's oral guarantee in the League of Nations that Japanese troops in Manchuria would withdraw as soon as possible to the extent permitted by the obligation to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents, decided in a Cabinet meeting today to instruct Yoshizawa to notify the League of Nations that Japan would immediately withdraw to its original defense positions once order was restored in the occupied areas. Japan has no intention of continuing to occupy the area after the Manchuria issue is resolved. (National News Agency Telegram on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Chinese here were greatly angered to hear the news that the Japanese representative to the League of Nations in Geneva formally declared that the Japanese military's occupation of Manchuria was not an act of war. The Chinese, including officials, are now questioning the confiscation of aircraft and trucks gathered at the arsenal by the Japanese military, the confiscation of military depots, the search of Chinese residences, and the confiscation of private property, as well as the property of leaders of the three northeastern provinces such as Zhang Zuoxiang and Tang Yulin. If these actions are not acts of war, then what are they? Regarding the news of Sino-Japanese negotiations, according to the Japanese Consul in Shenyang, the Consulate and the Jinzhou Provisional Government have not yet communicated with each other as of today.

<p>Does Not Advocate Direct Negotiations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government's position on Japan is said to have been decided early on. The general idea is that Japan's forcible occupation of the Northeast is not only testing the effectiveness of the League of Nations, but also that China cannot be forced into direct negotiations with Japan under duress and fall into failure in terms of strength. It has been instructed that Minister Shi in Geneva should act accordingly. (One-day special dispatch) Japanese Planes</p>

<p>British Director Personally Witnessed</p>
<p>Japanese Authorities Trying to Cover Up</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tangsen, the British Director of the Accounting Office of the Beijing-Shenyang Railway, reported the incident of the Japanese plane attacking the Beijing-Shenyang passenger train to Pu Sipei, the representative of the British-Chinese Company in a letter. I personally witnessed the Japanese plane attacking the Beijing-Shenyang passenger train. A total of four people were killed and four were injured. I have reported to the British Consul-General. This move almost endangered the lives of myself and my family members. The lives of men and women from Germany and Italy were also at risk. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese authorities' official denial of China's accusation that a plane bombed a passenger train on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway on September 24 has angered all sectors of Chinese society, surprised neutral countries, and disappointed those who are friendly to Japan. They had hoped that the Japanese military authorities would admit this atrocity and punish the aviation officers who committed it. The fact that the bombing occurred is beyond doubt. In addition to the hundreds of Chinese people on board who witnessed it, many influential foreigners, such as Thomson, the British Director of the Beijing-Shenyang Railway, personally saw a plane carrying out the attack and at least saw Chinese corpses. It is reported that at least two other trains were also attacked in the same way. However, the attack on train number 102 has been conclusively proven. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy spoke to a Reuters reporter this afternoon about the matter, still trying to cover it up, saying that the Japanese military authorities had telegraphed the results of the investigation, stating that a Japanese plane had flown out of Xinmintun, parallel to the railway line, and when it flew to a point about 500 meters north of Shangheganliao (transliteration, a place 15 kilometers southwest of Xinmintun), about 30 bandits suddenly jumped out of the nearby sorghum fields and fired at the Japanese plane. The Japanese plane returned fire, firing about ten rounds, and then flew back to Xinmintun due to engine damage. The pilot did not know that the train had been damaged.

<p>Japanese Conspiracy in the</p>
<h3 id="e13">Eastern Provinces Independence Movement <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Background Extremely Obvious</p>
<p>Our Country Questions the Japanese Government</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A high-ranking official in Beiping telegraphed the central government to expose the Japanese conspiracy in the Eastern Provinces independence movement, saying that there have been many strange sayings in recent Chinese and foreign reports. One is that after the three northeastern provinces were occupied by the Japanese army and announced an autonomous system, there was an independent movement system, a constitution to establish a new government. This movement is divided into two factions: (1) The four northeastern provinces and Mongolia secede from the Chinese mainland and organize an independent country, such as the Independent Youth Party, with the goal of overthrowing military leaders and realizing national self-determination; (2) Replace the northeastern authorities and obtain the benefits of Manchuria and Mongolia, divided into three steps: A. Support Puyi to restore the imperial system; B. Support a certain Zhang; C. Support Zhang Zongchang. The above-mentioned movements are already underway secretly. Second, powerful figures in Mongolia and Tibet plan to build an independent Manchuria and Mongolia, with the national name Zhonghe, and a draft constitution will be announced within two or three days. Third, powerful officials and civilians in Liaoning who are currently advocating Liaoning's independence, in the name of the Liaoning Provincial Situation Resolution Association, intend to send a telegram to Chiang and Zhang, the general idea being that the Association denies the National Government's military politics and vows to break away from the National Government. It is said that a new country is currently being formulated. Fourth, powerful civilians centered on the Maintenance Association organized by Yuan Jinkai and others have agreed on the policy of the new regime in the Eastern Provinces, and the resolutions are as follows: (1) The foundation of the new regime is based on all the people of the four northeastern provinces; (2) The main body of the new regime is organized by people who conform to public opinion, and its political system is determined; (3) The maintenance of personnel and political system issues shall be decided by publicly elected committee members; (4) The area is limited to the four northeastern provinces, and it declares independence from the Chinese mainland. Fifth, Chief of Staff Xi of Jilin Province announced ten articles of the Jilin Provincial New Government Organization Regulations on the 26th, that is, to establish the position of Governor of Jilin Province. The new government has abolished the committee system, and the Governor will have full power over military, political, civil, and local supervision. Although the above-mentioned reports have not yet been confirmed, the Japanese desire to annex the Eastern Provinces by means of the destruction of Korea has been a long-standing plan. In the past, Japanese people secretly carried out movements in the three northeastern provinces, breaking away from China to form an independent country, and the works protected by Japan are not just one kind. The movement to abolish the emperor and the Qing Dynasty restoration groups have long been known to the world. Zhang Xun's restoration in 1917 started after Tanaka came to China, and the relationship between them is also well known to the Chinese people. Now that they have occupied the three northeastern provinces by force, under various means of coercion and inducement, fabrication, and borrowing, what cannot be done? I urgently send a telegram to ask friendly countries and compatriots across the country to be aware of this. The central government believes that Japan's movement to have Manchuria and Mongolia break away from China and form an independent kingdom has an extremely obvious background. It has consulted with the Foreign Ministry and ordered Minister Shi Zhaoji to announce this Japanese conspiracy to the international community in a telegram. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters on the 1st, saying that he had received reports from various parties on the situation in the Northeast and submitted them for review. Among them, he listed Japanese intelligence on inciting Manchurian independence, saying at the end that Jilin and Heilongjiang were under their threat, and that anything could be done. Please tell the world not to be misled by them. We must know the true attitude of the people of Jilin and Heilongjiang, who support unification and do not advocate any different theories. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The establishment of the Liaoning Public Security Maintenance Association is the initial plan for Japan to annex the Northeast. Recently, they have threatened and lured Yuan Jinkai and Chong Lian to carry out the organization of the new government in the Northeast and break away from the central government and Zhang Xueliang. The outline of their agreement is: (1) The foundation of the new regime is based on the 30 million people in the Northeast; (2) The new political system is managed by people with freedom and democracy; (3) The decision on the ruling figures and the regime is decided by publicly elected members; (4) The area is limited to the four northeastern provinces and is definitely independent from the Chinese government of the central government. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Zhang Zongchang, Zhang Xuecheng, Shi Yousan and others are very active in Liaoning, hoping to be appointed by the Japanese side as the mainstays of the new government. Kan Zhaoxi, Zu Xianting and others formed the Shenyang Four People's Relief Association. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping Municipal Party Department telegraphed the central government, asking it to severely punish Yuan Jinkai and others, and to allow them to take the heads of the people of Rehe and fight the Japanese. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Chinese government's memorandum to the Japanese government stated that Japan should be responsible for the development of the Manchurian independence movement. The Japanese government replied that the Japanese government has from the beginning strictly prohibited officials and individuals from encouraging or supporting such movements, so it cannot bear any responsibility. Japan now welcomes the establishment of local public security maintenance agencies, as such agencies can help restore order and guarantee the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents, thereby facilitating the withdrawal of Japanese troops.

<h3 id="e17">The League of Nations' Accomplishments Are Thus <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>When the Japanese army's violent act of armed aggression against our Northeast occurred, the League of Nations was in session. We knew full well that we could not harbor any extravagant hopes for the League regarding this act of blatant betrayal of the covenant and disruption of peace. However, we believed that for the sake of maintaining its own existence, the League should at least implement some emergency measures to prevent the continued expansion of the violence. Yet, as of today, the facts prove that the League ultimately has no way to maintain its authority and life. Even the most basic work has not been done. The League Assembly, gathering representatives from various countries, endlessly discussing and pontificating, with its solemn demeanor, is merely a farcical comedy. And its proclaimed "justice" and "peace" are simply candies to deceive the weak. In short, the League is a large but useless paper tiger.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army implemented military force on September 18th, the violent troops have been rushing out in all directions, intensifying their actions. Wherever their iron hooves reach, our mountains and rivers change color accordingly. The people have fallen into misery. The Northeast has been almost completely trampled. As late as September 22nd, the League of Nations issued an extremely farcical emergency notice demanding the immediate withdrawal of troops from both countries. Chinese troops were stationed on their own national territory. Due to the Japanese army's attacks, they had retreated again and again, but the retreat was insufficient and they were still disarmed and shot. As the League of Nations notified, where exactly would the Chinese army retreat to? At that time, we were already doubtful that the League would ultimately be unable to implement its most basic work to prevent the paper tiger from being punctured so quickly.</p>
<p>And what about now? The League Council has already closed yesterday. At the last General Assembly of the League of Nations on the 28th of last month, Chairman Lerroux stated, "The Manchurian Incident between China and Japan has unfortunately not been resolved despite the Council's greatest efforts. However, the Council trusts Japan's declaration that it does not covet Chinese land and that the Japanese army will withdraw to the South Manchurian Railway zone as soon as possible. It firmly believes that direct negotiations between the two governments of China and Japan will be the best way to reach a final resolution." At the same time, he also stated, "The Council will continue to promote this method until a resolution is reached." He further announced, "The Administrative Council will extend its meeting for several days to handle the Sino-Japanese issue, which will strengthen the efforts of the Nanjing government to restrain the radical views and achieve a peaceful resolution." Until yesterday when the Council closed, it further resolved, "Notify Japan and hope that Japan will withdraw the Japanese troops in Manchuria back to their original locations from today until October 4th." Wonderful, Lerroux's words. Wonderful, the League Council's resolution. It is tactful, smooth, and considerate in all aspects. It neither offends the arrogant and stubborn Japan, nor does it leave a glimmer of "hope" for China. It is coquettish on both sides before leaving. Gathering politicians and diplomats from various countries in the hall, they have such a smooth and considerate resolution. A world-shaking change has been handled so lightly. The gentlemen of the League of Nations should also be proud of themselves.</p>
<p>However, there are still things we cannot help but say. (1) The Council deeply believes that Japan does not covet Chinese land and that the Japanese army will withdraw to the South Manchurian Railway zone as soon as possible. We truly do not understand what guarantee there is for such an absolutely risky trust. If the Japanese, even if they do not covet Chinese land, occupy it for a long time, if the withdrawal of the Japanese army is impossible to be expedited, if they retreat in the morning and advance again in the evening, how will the League of Nations explain itself? How will it deal with this situation? (2) If the Chinese and Japanese governments can directly negotiate, then why couldn't they directly negotiate before the Japanese army's violence was launched? Now they have broken into our house, occupied our hall, slaughtered our people, and plundered our wealth. Moreover, their violent actions have not ceased slightly. Now, they reiterate that direct negotiations between the two countries are possible. The Japanese can be complacent, but what about our country? Isn't this tantamount to an alliance under the city walls? The League of Nations' so-called "direct negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese governments are the best way to reach a final resolution" is fueling the arrogance of the aggressor and trampling on the weak. It may be wonderful, but how can the 400 million people of China endure it? Furthermore, the declaration by the Chairman of the Assembly, Sir Eric Drummond, that "the Assembly has no indication that it must intervene in the dangerous situation between China and Japan or discuss the Council's handling" is even more puzzling to us. The Japanese army's violence is not just a dangerous situation between China and Japan. It is clearly and unequivocally a violent attack, occupation of land, changing of flags, establishment of official offices, and slaughter of people. The situation is so serious. Yet, they say that "the Assembly has no indication that it must intervene." Then, how far must things go before it is necessary to intervene? The Japanese army's violence in the past half month is obvious in the facts. Our representative officially raised it at the meeting and it was acknowledged by the Japanese representative, but the League of Nations denied it. Our representative proposed that the Administrative Council should assist in the negotiations between China and Japan. It was opposed by the Japanese representative, and the League of Nations denied it. Being cautious and timid, and following the lead of the Japanese in everything, we truly do not understand how the League of Nations will survive in the future and how it will explain itself.</p>
<p>The League of Nations has now closed. The Japanese army's violence remains the same. The hope of withdrawing the Japanese troops by the 4th, what if it cannot be realized? Has the League of Nations ever considered the problems afterwards?</p>

<h3 id="e23">Receives Newspaper Reporters <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Propaganda Department received newspaper reporters at 2:00 PM on the 1st. Chen Burei, the chairman, reported, stating that during this national crisis, the work of all reporters has been very active. In the past ten days, he has seen that the newspapers and opinions of the whole country are able to unanimously take upholding the country as the premise, which is very gratifying to us. However, there are still a few points that you all hope for: (1) It is hoped that the national public opinion circle will, in this serious period, consider themselves as servants of the country and sincere friends of the people. In the overall and permanent interests of the country, they should not be afraid to contribute advice that is unpleasant to the ear, and should not only seek to cater to the current excited mentality and forget the need for a sustained and arduous struggle. (2) It is hoped that the national public opinion circle will confirm that it is appropriate for the people to spur the government during the foreign invasion period, but it is definitely not to criticize the government, accuse the government, or arbitrarily argue to embarrass the government for the sake of feeling happy. It must be known that only when the people help the government can the government have strength, and only when the government has strength can the country survive. (3) It is hoped that the national public opinion circle will awaken the people and truly recognize that our effort to save the country in this crisis is an extremely serious task. Without the heart of certain death, there can be no hope of surviving, and without real strength, there can be no hope of winning. There must be no fluke mentality and no trace of negligence. (4) It is hoped that the national public opinion circle will pay attention to the psychology of general despondency and pessimism during this period, and remedy it, and especially promote the spirit of sacrificing oneself to defend the country. The loyal and brave generals, soldiers, and people who sacrificed themselves for the country in the Eastern Provinces should be investigated in detail and especially promoted. Then, Cheng Tianfang reported that saving the country should not be regarded as a special event, but should be done earnestly in daily life, and should be carried out simultaneously with bandit suppression and disaster relief, and should not be neglected. Afterwards, Central Committee member Dai Chuanxian raised the following points and asked all reporters to express their opinions: (1) Observation of Japan's policies now and in the future. (2) The policies that China should take to deal with Japan. (3) Methods of national unity. (4) Methods of treating the symptoms and root causes of disaster relief. (5) How to improve and improve propaganda. The reporters who attended the meeting spoke one after another and expressed many opinions. Finally, Dai Chuanxian stood up and gave a speech, giving a heartfelt explanation of China's current position and the awareness that we should have. The speech lasted for an hour, and its main points can be roughly divided into three points: (1) Everyone must think about the fundamental interests of the nation, abandon the concept of life and death, success and failure, strive for the survival of the country, and leave a model for the nation. (2) Everyone must have a painful awareness, and all those responsible for politics, military affairs, education, and economy in the country should especially be aware of their own responsibilities, be strict with themselves, be lenient with others, take responsibility, and be brave in performing their duties, so that they can truly unite and generate a force to resist foreign enemies. (3) Everyone should firmly believe that China will never perish and the Chinese nation will never be destroyed, and should firmly believe that only the Three Principles of the People can save China, hold on firmly, not lie, and not waver. The Prime Minister said that if we cannot succeed, we should become benevolent. Becoming benevolent is also success. Even if we cannot succeed in one thing at one time, becoming benevolent is a successful factor in the overall and eternal lessons. Those who bear the responsibility of the country, whether civil or military, should all make a determination to become benevolent themselves, and create a cause that will surely succeed for the country and the nation.

<p>British Newspapers Advocate Active Intervention</p>
<p>The Manchester Guardian's editorial today stated that the League of Nations made a big mistake by not sending a committee to Manchuria. There is no clear evidence that Japan has earnestly fulfilled its guarantee to withdraw its troops. As far as Britain is concerned, if the Japanese do not earnestly withdraw their troops within half a month, then British Foreign Secretary Reading has a responsibility to advocate active intervention by the League of Nations. A Reuters correspondent in Geneva reported that Japanese representatives will leave Geneva today or tomorrow, while Chinese representative Dr. Shi will probably stay in Geneva to await the reopening of the Administrative Council on October 14. The news that the atmosphere of bandits is gradually intensifying in the disturbed areas of Manchuria is quite worrying. (Reuters Telegram from the 1st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Since the news of Manchuria's independence came here, the national public opinion has been unusually indignant. The Pravda newspaper has spared no effort in attacking the expansion of Japanese imperialism. The newspaper stated that the Japanese warlords first thought of plundering the Eastern Provinces by force, and then saw that the public opinion of the world was still untouchable, so they thought of obtaining it by means of usurpation. The newspaper continued that the Japanese military occupation of Manchuria is now in formal and concrete terms, and its purpose is nothing more than to separate the territory of the Eastern Provinces from the unified government of China, and then slowly annex it as Korea's achievement. This attempt is feared to become a reality soon. As for the so-called direct negotiations, it is nothing more than negotiating with the pro-Japanese warlords or governors selected by Japan itself. Those who depend on Japan's breath must be able to fulfill Japan's desire to take whatever it wants. Because in China today, these shameless warlords and governors who are willing to curry favor with foreigners are easy to find everywhere. Furthermore, the change of affiliation of China's Eastern Provinces to Japan has already been agreed to by other Pacific powers, because the Chinese authorities are now adhering to a gentle policy, and even ceding land to seek peace is something they would not hesitate to do. Other actions, such as begging for help from the League of Nations, are regarded in Moscow as acts of covering people's eyes and ears, in order to curb civilian resistance.

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Kechang and 11 other representatives from various labor unions in Shanghai arrived in Beijing at 8:00 AM on the 1st and went straight to the Central Government to petition. Ding Weifen, Chen Lifu, Zhang Daofan, Fang Juehui and others received them. The representatives submitted a petition, explaining the reasons for the petition. Ding Weifen and others replied, stating that the situation of Japan's aggression in the Eastern Provinces and its strength, as well as the situation of oppression of the Eastern Provinces from various aspects in recent years, should be deeply known by the compatriots. At this time, for the sake of rescuing the people and places of the Eastern Provinces, our compatriots throughout the country must at least express deep sympathy for the people and authorities in the Eastern Provinces who are under oppression. The authorities themselves are extremely sad about the responsibility for losing the army and land. If the people only attack them without giving them sympathy, it is like only blaming the victims for not repairing dikes and setting up defenses, and ignoring disaster relief, which will make no one responsible for the Eastern Provinces in the future, and there will be no way to resist Japan. This matter is of great importance to the future of the country, and I hope that our patriotic people will think deeply about it. The Chairman has repeatedly made painful and sincere statements to the people about the measures taken by the central government to deal with the Japanese advance into the Three Eastern Provinces. The Central Government is willing to accept the enthusiasm of the gentlemen and the hopes of various groups and people, but how to deal with it, I hope that the various groups will trust the National Government to help the government create a unified force throughout the country to resist Japanese aggression, awaken world public opinion, and save the country from danger. He also instructed the representatives to return to Shanghai. The representatives were satisfied and immediately went to the National Government to submit a petition, and went to Kong's residence to visit Hu Hanmin and ask him to resume his duties to jointly overcome the national crisis. The representatives completed their mission and returned to Shanghai that night. (Central News Agency Telegram from the 1st)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Municipal Party Committee held a standing committee meeting on the afternoon of the 29th. Lu Dangping proposed: (1) Send a telegram to support Chairman Chiang; (2) Advise the Guangdong side to abandon their suspicions and focus on foreign aggression. The telegram was drafted by Lu and sent out on the evening of the 30th. It stated that to complete the revolution, the first thing is to have competent leadership. To fight against the enemy with the same hatred, it is especially important to have unified action. In this autumn of national survival, we should trust the loyal, courageous, and steadfast leader. Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, who followed the Premier and adhered to the principles, has made great contributions in the Northern Expedition, the suppression of rebellions, and the suppression of bandits. He is the pillar of the Party and the country, and is looked up to by the people. Even if he is humble and frank, everything can be sacrificed, but to defend the country and the people, we need leadership. I hope that our compatriots and comrades will concentrate their will, consolidate the central government, and obey Chairman Chiang's unified political and military power, so as to negotiate and cope with national difficulties together. The future of the Party and the country depends on this. (2) The Japanese's forceful occupation of Liaoning and Jilin is becoming increasingly blatant, and disaster is imminent. The country will perish in no time. We should unite to save ourselves and have no time to argue about right and wrong and fight for power, without thinking about how to continue the lives of the descendants of Yan and Huang. According to reports, although you have expressed peace verbally, you are actually establishing a second government and enjoying yourselves with the title. Such disregard for the division of the country, indulging in personal will, provoking wars and inviting insults, the responsibility lies with you. The destruction of the country and the family will lead to the same end, helping the Japanese to abuse and laughing at foreigners. Future generations will find it difficult to escape criticism. It is not something that you should do. If your conscience has not died, I hope that you will go to Nanjing together to seek unity and quell the national crisis. This would be the greatest fortune.

Liu telegraphed Deputy Commander Zhang on the 29th, requesting him to order them to come to Kaifeng to study at Henan University. The original telegram stated that recently, the two universities in Jilin and Heilongjiang in the Northeast were unable to continue classes under the oppression of imperialists, causing young people to lose their schooling, which is deeply regrettable. Henan Provincial Henan University can still accommodate more than 300 people. It is proposed to accept students from the two universities in Jilin and Heilongjiang to rescue the students who have lost their schooling.

<p>Round Table Committee Shows Signs of Dissolution</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th - Reuters has learned today that the majority nationalities committee of the Indian Round Table Conference is now showing signs of dissolution. The committee met two days ago to mediate disputes among various nationalities regarding the number of seats in the Indian Parliament. At that time, the discussions showed signs of not proceeding smoothly. British Prime Minister MacDonald stated that the proposal for the British government to act as an arbitrator is a very unsatisfactory solution to this problem. Indians must bear the responsibility of resolving it themselves. Indians must do it themselves. If there is any disagreement, Indians must blame themselves and not blame others. After the British Prime Minister finished speaking, he adjourned the meeting and advised the representatives to resolve it themselves during the adjournment. That night, Gandhi visited the Muslim leader Aga Khan and discussed the matter for two hours, but the meeting ended without results. There has been no progress since then. Today, Gandhi told people that he intends to withdraw from the committee, but has not yet made a decision. He may express his opinion tomorrow. Gandhi said that if a clause is added to the constitution stating that India can resolve its own ethnic problems, then independence can be declared. The British Prime Minister is scheduled to meet with Gandhi and Aga Khan tonight to try to resolve their differences.</p>

<p>Left-Wing Leaders Form New Party</p>
<p>Kuomintang News Agency, Berlin, 30th - The largest political party in Germany is undoubtedly the Social Democratic Party. However, the undercurrents in the Social Democratic Party are also the strongest, showing signs of division from time to time. Recently, the left-wing leaders Rosenfeld and Scheidemann were expelled from the Social Democratic Party and formed the Socialist Workers' Party, issuing a declaration denouncing the Social Democratic Party leaders for their uncertain principles, and advising true socialists to quickly break away from the Social Democratic Party's ties. The future of this new party cannot be predicted prematurely. What is certain is that although the organization of the Social Democratic Party is still very tight and the authority of the leaders has not been shaken, after the establishment of the new party, the old party will inevitably be greatly hit in the confrontation with it. Perhaps the old party will be forced by the situation to adopt a more radical attitude in the future.</p>

<p>Public Telegrams</p>
<p>A telegram from Beiping to all newspapers: Japan has been plotting to occupy Manchuria and Mongolia for a long time. This time, they launched an invasion, acted ruthlessly, plundered property, and cruelly treated the people. Japan acts like a robber, and there is no justice to speak of. Our country allows them to bully us, making us worse than slaves. The masses in the Northeast are filled with righteous indignation and are determined to fight back. I dare to ask you to make a grand plan, actively prepare for war, quickly abandon prejudices, end internal strife, and do not rely on foreign forces for temporary relief. Gather public will to build a city and turn the tide. The survival of the nation is at stake at this moment. I submit this with tears, please consider it carefully. The National Salvation Association of the Northeast Masses bows respectfully.</p>
<p>A telegram from Haizhou relayed to compatriots across the country by all newspapers: The Japanese invaders have been perpetrating atrocities for a long time and are now forcing us into danger, leading the masses to invade. We have made concessions again and again, but they are getting an inch after they get a foot. If we continue to endure, the country will perish in no time. The reason why we are willing to retreat is that we rely on the League of Nations to uphold justice on our behalf. Now the League of Nations has received the Japanese representative's sweet words and politely declined fair direct negotiations between China and Japan. Since justice cannot be upheld, the only way to avenge the national humiliation is to resort to force. May our countrymen seek life with a determination to die and go to death with a desire to live. The whole country unites and fights against the enemy with the same hatred. All of us in Haizhou will act as the rearguard. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Donghai Middle School.</p>
<p>A telegram from Guide to all newspapers: This time, Japan disregarded international law and human faith, taking advantage of our difficulties to forcefully occupy Shenyang, engulfing the eastern provinces, attacking our troops, capturing our officials, bombing our gun factories, and burning our streets. They also sent warships to harass and demonstrate in our coastal ports, showing their strength and acting violently, fully exposing their conspiracy. If this is tolerated, will the country still exist? In this critical moment of survival, our soldiers have an unshirkable responsibility to protect the country and the people. What are we waiting for to achieve benevolence and righteousness? The military and civilians of the country should unite, support the central government, and fight against the enemy with the same hatred to drive away the fierce invaders. I submit this with tears, vowing to devote myself to the national crisis, preparing for battle, and waiting for instructions. The undersigned cannot contain his grief. Commander Zhang Lisheng of the Second Cavalry Division of the National Revolutionary Army, Deputy Commander Jiang Kanru, Chief of Staff Sun Yu, Brigade Commanders Ge Wucheng and Zhang Shutian, and Regimental Commanders Wang Xianzhang, Zhang Chuanfu, Ji Zhen, Bei Qing, Gao Shude, and Ma Jiewu, along with all the officers and soldiers, respectfully bow.</p>
<p>A telegram from Wuhu relayed to compatriots across the country by the Shenbao: This time, Japan violated international treaties, destroyed world peace, and sent heavy troops to invade and occupy the eastern provinces. Wherever the fierce flames reached, villages were turned into ruins. However, at this time of foreign aggression, it is time for the Chinese people to be inspired. All teachers and students of our school have organized an anti-Japanese support association and are stepping up military training, vowing to destroy this enemy to relieve the national crisis. The undersigned cannot contain his anger. All the teachers and students of the Second Vocational School of Anhui Province respectfully bow.</p>
<p>A telegram from Tunxi relayed to all the elders and fellow countrymen by the Shenbao: The Japanese soldiers are acting violently, disregarding justice, occupying our territory, and killing our compatriots. We are determined to be pioneers out of anger. Signed, all members of the Second Middle School of Anhui Province. A telegram from Nanchang to all newspapers: The Japanese invaders have been plotting to occupy our Northeast for a long time. This time, taking advantage of our natural disasters and man-made calamities, they brazenly sent troops to occupy our territory, capture our officials, kill our soldiers and civilians, and plunder our wealth, attempting to destroy our country and annihilate our nation. When the news came, we were filled with grief and anger. If this is tolerated, how can we survive? I, Yun Jie, am a soldier and have the duty to defend the country. I have always kept in mind the teachings of forbearance and cannot forget the desire for revenge. I am deeply concerned that the League of Nations' peace talks will not stop the Japanese violence. Rather than sitting idly by and allowing others to slaughter us to win a reputation for loving peace, it is better to fight to the death to seek a final victory. Jie is willing to lead his troops and devote himself to the vanguard, annihilate this enemy, and hope that all compatriots and comrades of the country will rise up together and save the country from danger. I submit this with tears, awaiting clear instructions. Li Yunjie, Commander of the Twenty-seventh Army of the Army and Commander of the Twenty-third Division, leading all the officers and soldiers, respectfully bow.</p>
<p>A telegram from Gong Bingfan to all newspapers and groups and all compatriots: Since the Wang Wanshan incident, the wolfish ambitions of Japanese imperialism have long been seen by the world. We had hoped that they would repent in time to make up for their past mistakes, but unexpectedly, they have recently intensified their actions, advancing troops to occupy the provinces of eastern China, and famous cities have fallen one after another, burned to the ground. At a time when our disasters have not yet subsided, they have taken advantage of the fire to rob, kicking people when they are down, which is utterly devoid of conscience. When all of our compatriots see this disaster approaching, how can they continue to tolerate it? We should all be determined to endure hardship and be prepared to fight to the death. Otherwise, when the nest is overturned, there will be no intact eggs. The destruction of the country and the extinction of the race is imminent. I am concerned about the future of the nation and feel frightened. The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of everyone, especially soldiers. How can we not be inspired? I will now sharpen my weapons and prepare to annihilate this enemy, and I will not hesitate to go through fire and water and die a thousand deaths. I submit this with tears, awaiting clear instructions. Gong Bingfan, Commander of the Twenty-eighth Division of the Army, leading all the officers and soldiers, respectfully bow.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Beiping Citizens' Anti-Japanese Rally <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>More than 200,000 People Participate</p>
<p>Representative Zhang Makes a Statement, Vowing Never to Betray the Country</p>
<p>The Beiping Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Citizens' Assembly was held this morning (28th) at 10:00 AM in front of Taihe Gate. Schools and government offices in Beiping took a half-day holiday on their own initiative, and many shop assistants also closed their businesses to participate. More than 250 organizations, representatives, and citizens, totaling over 200,000 people, attended, creating a highly enthusiastic and impassioned atmosphere. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM, and the entire assembly divided into three routes to parade.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The parade attracted onlookers, and the streets were empty, with everyone feeling sadness and sympathy. The parade dispersed around 1:00 PM. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Meeting Scene: In front of Taihe Gate, a platform was built facing south, with a white cloth banner hanging in front, reading "Beiping City Anti-Japanese National Salvation Assembly." In the center was a portrait of Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang party flag. Two additional public speaking platforms were built to the left and right of the main platform, with similar arrangements. The Public Security Bureau's police security team and bicycle team arrived at the scene around 8:00 AM to set up positions. Meridian Gate and the east and west Xihua Gates were guarded by police to direct pedestrians. Around 9:00 AM, citizens and students from various schools arrived in orderly formations, holding various colored flags with anti-Japanese slogans written on them. They entered in an orderly fashion through each gate and gathered below the platform. Representatives from the provincial and municipal party headquarters and various government agencies were in the center, flanked by students from major and minor schools and citizens. Due to the large number of people, the planned formation could not be maintained. Even as the meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM, people continued to arrive in an endless stream, making it difficult to move inside Meridian Gate. Within the assembly area, each organization had its own security team, and everyone was motivated by patriotic fervor, resulting in extremely strict, solemn, and tragic order.</p>
<p>Order of the Meeting: The assembly was originally scheduled to begin at 9:00 AM, but the presidium held a temporary discussion in front of Taihe Gate to review the proposals submitted by various sectors, numbering no fewer than fifty or sixty. After the review was completed, it was already past 10:00 AM when the assembly was declared open. Everyone sang the party anthem and performed the rituals. The chairman then reported the purpose of the meeting. Next, representatives from various sectors spoke simultaneously on the platform and speaking platforms, each limited to five minutes. The speeches were all impassioned. Around 11:00 AM, after the speeches were completed, the chairman read out the assembly proposals, totaling twenty-nine. The public passed each one individually.</p>

<p>Three Routes of Parade: After the meeting adjourned, the parade was led by inspectors and the general commander, divided into three routes. The western route started from Xihua Gate, including more than 40 organizations such as Yenching University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Pingmin University, Affiliated High School, Army University, municipal government and affiliated education, social, and finance bureaus, Girls' Middle School, Beiping Normal School and Affiliated Elementary School, Provincial No. 17 Middle School, No. 4 Middle School, and anti-Japanese associations of various schools. The route proceeded south along Nanchang Street, entered West Chang'an Street, turned north at Xidan, passed west to Xinjiekou, west to Xizhimen, and then disbanded. The southern route started from Tiananmen, including more than 100 organizations such as Minguo College, Peking Union Medical College, Tram Workers' Union, China College, Normal University, Academy of Arts, Quartermaster School, Russian Language and Law College, and Jiaotong University. The route proceeded south along Qianmen to Zhushikou, turned west along Luomashi Street to Xuanwumen, Xidan to the Deputy Commander's Camp. The eastern route started from Donghua Gate, including more than 80 organizations such as Northeast Military Police Deputy Commander's Office, Chaoyang University, Salt Affairs School, Peking University, Chongde Middle School, Municipal No. 2 Middle School, Datong Middle School, Franco-Chinese School, and Yuying Middle School. The route proceeded along Jinyu Hutong to Mishi Street, turned north through Dongsi to Beixinqiao, turned west, passed through Gulou Street, and disbanded at Houmen. Along the way, they shouted slogans, extremely tragically and sorrowfully, and distributed propaganda. Citizens who could not attend the meeting all stood by the roadside, shouting slogans in unison. For a time, the streets were empty. When the large group passed, all shops temporarily stopped trading. The situation was extremely enthusiastic and sorrowful. The parade dispersed around 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Representatives Visit Zhang: After the parade teams on the three routes completed their parade according to the planned routes, they turned back to West Chang'an Street and went to the Deputy Commander's Camp to petition. First, they were received by Chief of Staff Ji Jiqiao and Adjutant Chief Shen Zutong on behalf of the Deputy Commander. Then, 24 representatives from various organizations went to Prince Shuncheng's Mansion to request an audience with Zhang Xueliang, accompanied by Tang Guozhen and Shen Zutong. Zhang appeared at 5:30 PM, wearing a blue woolen robe, and shook hands with the representatives as a greeting. First, Dong Lin, chairman of the assembly, reported on the progress of the citizens' assembly and the reasons for the proposals. Then, Hu Jiachun explained the various situations of the proposals. Zhang read each proposal in detail and gave the following simple reply: Zhang replied: (Regarding the first proposal) Telegraphing the local governments of the Northeast, requesting that they not negotiate directly under Japanese violence (and the second proposal) Petitioning the central government that no negotiations can begin until the Japanese troops have withdrawn - these two points are the same matter. Regarding diplomatic issues, we must listen to the command of the central government, and there will be no self-handling. (Regarding the third proposal) Actively declaring war on Japan is a matter for the country and should be conveyed to the central government. I believe Chairman Chiang will also act according to the will of the people. (Regarding the fourth proposal) Announcing the invalidity of all unequal treaties between China and Japan should be conveyed to the central government. (Regarding the fifth proposal) Requesting that Deputy Commander Zhang not negotiate with Shigemitsu - Shigemitsu has not met with me. Even Yano has met with me three or four times, but it was regarding other matters and discussing handling them. (Regarding the sixth proposal) Warning Cao Rulin and prohibiting his activities - Regarding Cao Rulin's matter, because he is familiar with the situation in Japan, he had a memorandum to present, so I asked him to come and talk. In the future, if he wants to come, I will definitely inform you. (Regarding the seventh proposal) Petitioning the central government to unite against foreign aggression and stop the civil war - I have long agreed with this. Chairman Chiang wrote a letter saying that as long as it benefits the country, individual positions can be sacrificed. (Regarding the eighth proposal) Requesting the government to publish its policy towards Japan - this should be conveyed to the central government, but there are inconvenient points to explain, I hope you will forgive me. Next, Zhang said that among the proposals of the citizens' assembly, there was a request that Deputy Commander Zhang strictly order military officers in the Northeast not to adopt a policy of non-resistance in the future. In fact, various sectors have misunderstood the so-called policy of non-resistance. This unfortunate incident was not only unexpected to me, but I am afraid it was also unexpected to everyone. Previously, in order to prevent Japanese provocations, I ordered them to adopt a policy of non-resistance. This proves our deep love for peace. Now the troops have reached appropriate locations, and all matters are being handled under the command of the central government. Next, a certain representative asked Zhang to express his personal opinion. Zhang said that personal position and life can be sacrificed, but he will never do anything to betray the country. After Hu Jiachun explained that he was satisfied with Zhang's opinion, Zhang said again, "Now, I have a few last words to say. That is, if everyone loves the country, it must be done from a holistic perspective, and it must be developed evenly. Do not demand far-reaching memorials because of temporary emotional impulses. This is one point. To resist Japan, China must be unified. If China is unified, I dare say that this matter would not have happened. If I, Zhang, do anything to betray the country, please beat me to death, I have no resentment. All matters must be done by yourselves. Now, there are still those who want to take this opportunity to interfere with the government, such as uniting A to overthrow B, which are not good phenomena for the country. In short, I, Zhang Xueliang, am willing to do all matters myself. If I do anything to betray the country, you can kill me, cut off my head, I am also willing." At this point, the representatives then took their leave and departed.</p>
<h3 id="e68">The Beining Railway is Still Not Safe <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Large Groups of Bandits Appear and Cause Disturbances from Time to Time</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Still Harbor Hostility Towards Railway Police</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The section of the Beining Railway outside the Guan Pass has been relatively stable for the past two days. The tracks on the Rao River, which were dismantled by bandits, have been repaired by the railway bureau with a temporary detour, and traffic has resumed. Yesterday, all passenger trains arrived safely at Huanggu Tun. To avoid accidents, the railway bureau is extremely cautious with each train passing east of Dahushan. Railway police go out to inspect the tracks at any time, and if there are any suspicious signs, they immediately notify the train to be prepared. They also order each train to pass during the day. Although each train is still running as usual, there are very few passengers going to Shenyang. Even those coming from Shenyang West have decreased sharply compared to the previous few days, because most of the residents from other provinces have left. Those who are still staying in Shenyang are reluctant to leave, and the Japanese troops do not allow anyone carrying property to pass through the South Manchuria Railway crossing. When inspecting pedestrians, they immediately tear up any Chinese currency they find, and confiscate Japanese currency. In general, people are unwilling to abandon everything and leave unless they have no choice. Yesterday, bandits were found in Baqiabao and Yingfangcun. The number of bandits in Yingfangcun reached 500. Fortunately, they did not invade the station, and the railway police have urgently strengthened their defenses. The Japanese troops still harbor hostility towards the railway police. Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, more than a dozen Japanese troops went to Huanggu Tun and peeped into the factory from the wooden road at the receiving point of the Beining Machine Factory. When they saw the railway police guarding the gate, they used belts and guns to stab and beat the railway police. Railway policeman Wei Changyu was stabbed in the left leg, with a wound more than an inch deep, and immediately fell to the ground. Another railway policeman, Zhang Shiqin, was hit in the head by a Japanese military belt, and blood flowed all over his face. When the Japanese troops saw no resistance, they left angrily. The two injured policemen were taken to Huanggu Tun Hospital for treatment. The remaining railway police were terrified when they saw the Japanese troops arbitrarily committing violence, and they dared not fully perform their duties. (29th)</p>

On that day, staff were sent to the branch associations in each district to work with local agencies, groups, schools, and businesses to give lectures within the scope of the district. More than 100,000 people were gathered in each district. The people were extremely excited. (3) The urban and rural general associations and branch associations have been checking for Japanese goods at important points on land and water in recent days, and have been very strict. Dozens of cases have been found on various express boats, and penalties have been imposed according to the severity of the violations.

Implementation measures have been formulated, and letters have been sent to various sectors to register.

<p>Security Regiment's Mortar and Machine Gun Company Departs: Cao Pang, head of the Songjiang Security Regiment's Second Regiment, received a telegram from Li Mingyang, director of the Anqing Pacification Office, stating that the regiment's mortar and machine gun companies were stationed in Zhenjiang to protect the provincial capital. The telegram ordered the company commanders to leave for Songjiang immediately and return to their establishment. After receiving the telegram, Regiment Commander Cao immediately ordered Deputy Adjutant Wan Xi to contact the Public Security Bureau to find houses in the Tenth Factory outside the North Gate as a residence. He also ordered the servants to clean up and prepare everything.</p>
<p>Design of a Public Speaking Platform: The local party and government agencies have found that every time there is a memorial day, they hire craftsmen to build a platform in the public stadium as a speaking venue. Each time, the wages cost dozens of yuan. Therefore, they plan to raise money from various agencies to build a public speaking platform as a long-term solution to avoid wasting unnecessary losses. Everyone agreed with the proposal. The Construction Bureau has designed drawings and submitted them to today's (1st) party and government talks for discussion. According to the drawings, the estimated cost of labor and materials is 2,600 yuan. Everyone agreed that the amount was too large and difficult to raise, and that it should be reduced and the building cost estimated at 1,500 yuan. Redesign and draw the drawings for approval at the next talks, and then discuss fundraising methods.</p>

<p>Warning of the Opening of the Eastern Dam: There have been repeated rumors of the opening of the Eastern Dam in Gaochun. Hu Pu'an, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, ordered the dispatch of provincial security teams to protect it, and telegraphed the counties concerned to issue announcements to refute the rumors. Yesterday, he invited representatives from the counties concerned to hold a meeting at the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce to discuss and properly devise a good method. However, news came that the Liyang County Chamber of Commerce suddenly received a report from the Eastern Dam that the people of the counties below Wuhu had decided to open the dam. The people of Anhui Province gathered in Chuncheng, and were about to come down soon. It was feared that there would be a conflict with the provincial security teams stationed at the dam. At present, the gentry of the Eastern Dam repeatedly asked for a postponement of the discussion, but it was feared that it would be difficult to allow it. Please prepare as soon as possible. Theft Occurs in Wan'an City: Deng Ahua, a resident of Zhang Gaozhuang, the 93rd map of the 16th district (Wan'an City) of the county, is now the head of the map and is quite wealthy, with dozens of acres of fertile land, which has been coveted by bandits. At about 11:00 PM on the previous day (30th), seven or eight bandits suddenly came to Deng's house, broke into the house by climbing over the wall, and searched arbitrarily. They left with the stolen goods after an hour. After checking, it was found that more than 400 yuan was lost.</p>

<p>Troops Stationed to Prevent Japanese Warships and Sailors from Landing: Japanese warships often arrive at the ports of Nantong to patrol. The 280th Regiment stationed there has been ordered to prevent accidents. Zhang, the Director of Yangzhou, sent a telegram ordering that if a Japanese warship arrives, it should be moored in the river. Local people should be dispatched to the ship to politely refuse its landing. If the ship must land to buy goods, only three people are allowed, and they are not allowed to land on their own. If they are determined to occupy the land by force, then they have a responsibility to defend the territory and should take appropriate self-defense measures.

<p>Causes and Consequences of the Industrial Bank's Run: The Yangzhou China Industrial Bank has always been known for its good credit. It was not until news of the Nanjing Industrial Bank's run came that people holding banknotes came to the bank to cash them at 5:00 PM on the 29th, causing panic in the market. By 8:00 PM, more than 70,000 yuan had been cashed out. Suddenly, it was rumored that cashing would only be allowed until 11:00 AM on the 30th. Men and women holding banknotes went to the bank to cash them. The bank was suddenly crowded with five or six hundred people. Those who were late were turned away. For a time, the order was in chaos. Fortunately, Guo, a standing committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, was invited by telephone to the bank to mediate, and the Public Security Bureau sent police to maintain order. Pan Songping, chairman of the Industrial Association, and Guo, the standing committee member, went to the stage to comfort the crowd and promised to cash them. Meanwhile, Pan, Guo, and Yang, along with Yao, the younger brother of the manager of the bank, went to Deyidazhuang to borrow 1,000 yuan, Yishengzhuang 2,200 yuan, and Huiyuzhuang 1,800 yuan, together with the 10,000 yuan that the bank withdrew from the Bank of Communications, totaling 15,000 yuan, to plan a safe cashing procedure. Guo also requested six more police officers from the First Branch to escort Zhuang Zhongwei, the bank's cashier, to cash them. In an instant, the money ran out, and two-thirds of the people had left. There were about 100 people left. Chairman Shen added the stamp of the Industrial Association to the banknotes held by the people and promised to cash them on the 30th, or have the association cash them on their behalf. The crowd calmed down and dispersed. Guo has now telegraphed the Zhenjiang Money Shop to report to Wang Jingting, the chairman of the Jiangdu County Chamber of Commerce, to urge him to return to Yangzhou. He received a reply saying that he would transport 150,000 foreign dollars to Yangzhou on the 30th to maintain the situation. A cashing run was thus calmed down.</p>

<p>丨Forced to Travel in Vain Due to Japanese Army's Atrocities丨</p>
<p>Four Netball Knights from Singapore, including Lin Wangsu, Come Together 丨Invited by the Association to Participate in Flood Relief Tennis Tournament丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai Law School, led by President Chu Fucheng and teachers Shen Nanyang, has 2 million overseas Chinese in British Malaya, who are most concerned about national affairs. This year, the central government originally planned to hold the National Games in Beijing on Double Ten Festival. Overseas Chinese there also sent athletes back to China to participate. First, sports meetings were held in Singapore, Johor, Selangor, Perak, Malacca, Sabah, and Penang to select preliminary representatives, and then a re-election was held throughout the Malayan Peninsula. The results were very good. The national records for men's 300 meters, 400-meter hurdles, long jump, javelin throw, and women's 50 meters, long jump, and shot put were broken. A total of more than 200 male athletes were selected, led by Lin Jindian as the chief leader, waiting to depart. First, Lin Aimin, the director of general affairs, was sent to Shanghai to make arrangements. Before departing, rumors spread that the National Games would be postponed. He telegraphed the organizing committee of the games in Beijing to inquire. The organizing committee replied that it had not yet been decided. However, the deadline for the meeting was approaching, so more than 20 female athletes, led by the competition director Zheng Jiede and the female manager Liu Yunxian, departed from Singapore on the French postal ship "Adotos" on the 20th and arrived in Shanghai today (2nd). The four netball riders from Singapore, Shang Lin Wangsu and others, also came together. The male athletes and the German leader Lin Jindian were unable to come because of the atrocities committed by the Japanese army in Liaoning. With the country in crisis, the overseas Chinese were indignant and were planning practical ways to save the country, and the news of the postponement of the games also arrived. Lin Jindian was originally one of the leaders of the overseas Chinese, and many of the male athletes were also well-known figures in society. It is a pity that the opportunity was missed and they could not come to the motherland to show their skills. The skills of the female athletes are amazing.</p>
<p>Among these twenty-odd female athletes, it is said that in the track and field competition, Lin Dafang's shot put is close to the Far East record, Cao Hanhua's sprint, Zhang Feiru's high jump, and Zhang Zhixiong's long jump have all broken national records. The strength of the volleyball team and basketball team is also very strong. Shanghai intends to hold a women's track and field competition, as well as volleyball and basketball matches, so that the athletes who have traveled across the ocean can also know how capable the female athletes in Shanghai are. The full list of names is on the left:</p>
<p>Team leader Zheng Jiede, Ms. Liu Yunxian, High Jump Zhang Feiru, Chen Yulan, Long Jump Zhang Zhixiong, Ye Bingmei [Zhang Zhichao, Chen Jinying, Javelin Throw Liang Yiyun, Li Xinyi, Lin Dafang, Shot Put Lin Dafang, Li Xinyi, Chen Xiuhua, 50 meters Cao Hanhua, Zhang Zhichao, Ye Bingmei, Zhang Zhixiong, 100 meters Cao Hanhua, Zhang Zhichao, Ye Bingmei, Zhang Zhixiong, 200 meters Cao Hanhua, Zhang Zhichao, Ye Bingmei, Zhang Zhixiong, 80-meter hurdles Cao Hanhua, Liang Yiyun, Yu Saiwu, 400-meter relay (Malayan Chinese team) Cao Hanhua, Zhang Zhixiong, Zhang Zhichao, Ye Bingmei.</p>

<p>Four Knights Come Together</p>
<p>The Singapore tennis team, which the whole country expects, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today on the French postal ship "Adotos". Lin Wangsu, Wu Yiguang, Cai Chunliang, and Lin Yuehan, a total of four people who are famous for a while, will challenge the Shanghai tennis stars. Although the demonstration tennis match scheduled by the National Sports Association has been canceled, the flood relief tennis is still in the plan. Shanghai tennis is once again showing active signs. A brief description of the four knights of Singapore is as follows:</p>
<p>Lin Wangsu is the captain of the Singapore team. He won the Singapore singles championship this year. In the All-Star final, he defeated the Japanese Matsumoto 11-9, 6-0. The last time he came to Shanghai, he played against Lin Baohua and once took the lead 2-1. In the fourth set, Wangsu was ahead 2-1, but it was called off due to darkness. Lin holds the racket with his left hand and is good at long shots from the baseline. Although he is not tall, his hitting method is unexpected.</p>
<p>Wu Yiguang Wu has held the Malayan Federation Championship for three years. In this year's Malayan City Games, Wu lost to Lin Wangsu 8-6, 6-4. His accurate and powerful backhand is his most proud thing. Cai Chunliang is Qiu Feihai's old partner in Singapore and the runner-up in Singapore. His net interception is the most powerful. He once defeated Aragon of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Lin Yuehan finished third in Singapore this year. He once came to Shanghai with Wangsu the year before last. His ball skills should also be ranked first. Although he lost to Lin Baohua, he should be looked at with new eyes after three days of separation.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Gold Price Sees Another Small Dip <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>This session's swap had talk of a one-month extension. Yesterday's price fixing saw a slight downturn, with calm waves, though morning and noon still saw fluctuations around ten taels. Evening market movements were only four or five taels. The daily range was within twenty taels. Public sentiment remained unsettled, and the final drop exceeded five taels. Trading among various firms was complex. The proposed settlement price, following the American dollar method, was decided upon by industry peers after a meeting. The swap scheduled for the 5th of this month was cancelled, and the November to December swap will be temporarily suspended, extended for one month, with long and short positions either paying in or out, balancing overall, awaiting the 16th of November to settle the December to January period according to the American dollar method. Based on this approach, wouldn't it be more advantageous for the short positions? However, the exchange authorities haven't yet approved it and require another meeting before it can be announced, though the market price has already been suppressed. The silver market reported a decline, initially rising slightly, but supply and demand differed greatly, and the foreign exchange trend was complex, with external tightness and internal ease. Therefore, the gold price hovered around 730 taels. A high price of forty taels was once observed. The market outlook was mediocre, finally settling around thirty taels. There were no special changes in exchange controls.</p>
<p>Morning Opening Returns High by 3.5 Taels. From the morning opening of the November contract, there was an immediate rise of 3.5 taels to 739 taels, not particularly strong. Large bars only fell by 3/16, the silver price dropped by 6/8, while private cables only fell by 3/8. Selling pressure remained strong. Yuanmao, Yongcheng, Fengyong, Qianchang, Xiangwan, Xingshun, and Shunli all sold, causing the price to fall sharply by over ten taels, reaching twenty-four taels at 9:15. Exchange rates were also cheaper than at the opening. Zhengjin offered Japanese yen at 6.05 sen per tael, Mitsui offered British pounds at 164375. Shortly after, Yongfeng, Zhifeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, Fushun, Dalian firms, and arbitrageurs all entered the market. With British pounds settling at 375, the price rebounded by seven or eight taels to thirty-two taels. Almost immediately, Yuanmao, Yongyu, and others sold, further driven by Zhengjin buying US dollars at 31.25. By the time the British pound rate was announced at twenty-four taels, the listed price only contracted by 25, the US dollar by 125, and the Japanese yen remained unchanged. Consequently, the price fell again to twenty-two taels. Later, HSBC absorbed 16.5 of this month's British pounds, Mitsui and others offered November Dalian at 1.595 taels. Dalian firms made some gains, coupled with Chengfeng, Yongyuan, Cheng Yongyuanxing, Yongdadecheng, and US dollar arbitrageurs all entering the market, the market atmosphere suddenly turned favorable, and prices rose happily, totaling over ten taels. However, there were fluctuations of three to four taels. US dollars could be traded at around 30.0875, and November Dalian added to 1.61 taels, solidifying public sentiment. By 10:50, it reached 740 taels. After 11:00, a sudden decline occurred, due to Daxing, Yongdai, Indian merchant Qiaozhifu unloading, followed by Yuda, Yuanmao, Yongshun, Wanxing, and others selling in succession, causing a sharp drop of ten taels in one hour, reaching twenty-nine taels at noon. Guangdong firms made slight purchases, and at the closing, it was 31.5 taels, continuing with minor fluctuations, around thirty taels. The listed price remained at 819 taels, calculating a difference of ninety-one to eighty taels. The noon close was eighty-seven or eighty-eight taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Closing Continues to Fall 5.5 Taels. The afternoon market opened at thirty-one taels, then retreated from 1.5 taels to 26.5 taels, followed by Zhifeng and Yongheng selling. Shortly after, Daxing, Yongyuanxing, Yonghengxing, and others bought. Grain merchants also bought forward US dollars at 31.25. Korean firms entered November Japanese yen at 1.585 taels, first ordering Shanghai to consume 16625. By 2:30, it was thirty-three taels, suddenly sold off by Dalian firms and Tychang, and because British pounds had to increase to 6875, it retreated to 28.5 taels at 2:50. However, Daxing, Yongyuanxing, Yongdadecheng, and others continued to buy, and HSBC ate 31.875, causing Citibank to raise the price by over four taels to 33.2 taels at 3:30. Afterwards, Qianchangxiang, Cuichang, and Yongdeng continued to sell. Especially with Indian exchange reporting a significant four annas, it immediately reduced the price by five taels to twenty-eight taels at 4:20. Yuanxingyong entered the market again, immediately rising by over three taels to 31.5 taels, then back to 29.5 taels, until the closing at 4:30 at thirty taels, again rising to thirty-two taels, then slightly suppressed by over one tael, calculated at thirty-one taels. Compared to the previous day (based on listed prices), it fell by 5.5 taels. Based on the daily maximum of forty taels and minimum of twenty-two taels, there was a difference of eighteen taels. Commodity morning market thirty-six taels, morning close twenty-nine taels, afternoon thirty-one taels, closing thirty-one taels. The listed price calculated a difference of around ninety taels, logging water replenishment at thirty-two taels, the afternoon only replenishing water at thirty taels. The current naked bars are still increased by fourteen taels. There was little trading. Yingfengheng and Taikangrun, etc., spot firms had some activity.</p>
<p>The Turnover of Various Firms Varies, Trading on the Floor is Diverse. Statistics show that Yuanchengyong, Dadedecheng, Yifengyong, Hengxing, Hengchangyong, Taifengcheng, and Qianchangxiang had entries and exits, still with purchases. Futaiheng, Shunli, Yuantai, Zhifengyong, Dadedecheng, etc., had quite complex entries and exits, with many customer notes within. Cuichangyong and Fushun first entered and then exited. Yuanmaoyong, Wanxing, Yuda, Tongtaichang, Yuanmao, and Chunyuanyong all exited. Yuanxingyong and Chengfengyong exited and then re-entered. Daxingyong, on behalf of foreign merchant Qiaozhifu, sold eight or nine hundred bars, and those who hedged sterling sold bars, and those who sold US dollars entered. In the afternoon, Tongtaichang, Shunli, Wanxing, Cuichangyong, Qianchangxiang, and Zhifengyong all exited, while Hengxing, Daxingyong, and Dadedecheng entered. Yuanxingyong entered several thousand bars on behalf of a certain household. Yifengyong, Yuanchun, Yuandayong, and Futaiheng sometimes entered and sometimes exited. Sterling arbitrage was quite complex. Dalian firms sold a total of sixteen or seventeen hundred and entered seven or eight hundred. Guangdong firms bought six or seven hundred bars and sold one or two hundred bars.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Large Bars Continue to Shrink 25 <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, London Dispatch of the 1st. Near and far large bars each shrunk by a quarter. The near term is 15 pence 9375, the far term is 16 pence 125.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Exchange Market Still in Chaos <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Listed Price Revised Downward, Trading Still Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, both British, American, and silver markets shrunk. Exchange rates rose. Japanese and American rates increased again by two cents to 4939. As for the HSBC listed price, it has already been reduced by one notch, calculated at 25 for British pounds, to 1 shilling 5 pence 75. US dollars only contracted by 125 due to exchange rate balancing, calculated at 29 yuan. Japanese yen is still calculated at 1 tael 7 qian. Indian rupees decreased by six yuan, French francs by a small two yuan, German marks unchanged, local foreign exchange by a small one yuan, Singapore foreign exchange increased by 2.5 taels, Hong Kong increased by 25 to 78.75 taels. Internal markets were initially firm, then eased, later trending upward, remaining level at noon, then weakening in the afternoon. The result compared to the previous noon showed British pounds up 1875, US dollars up 3125, truly a difference between announced and actual rates. Japanese yen increased by half a cent, quite the opposite. Recent market conditions have been quite complex and chaotic, and the gold market saw a compression due to talk of extending the swap period, finally remaining at the 730 tael mark. Trading among Chinese merchants was still active, with over one hundred thousand pounds of British pounds arbitrated for hedging. However, US dollars continued to be dumped, with approximately six or seven hundred thousand yuan traded. Both British and American banks absorbed some. Dalian firms also bought back Dalian, which was a leveling transaction, estimated at over one hundred and several ten thousand yuan, with the decision to no longer do so in the future, in order to strengthen the resolve to resist Japan.</p>
<p>The British exchange internal market saw a fluctuation of 375. From the early market asking price of 1 shilling 6 pence 25, buying price 375, Mitsui offered December 4375, and also offered 375.

<h3 id="e97">Prominent Interest Rates Show a Trend of Stabilization <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview. Yesterday, the market conditions for both silver and foreign currency seemed like those of the past. Although interest rates have changed, they no longer have the shock of the old days. As for the tight or loose situation of silver funds, there is no difference from the previous day. Bank settlements, starting from yesterday, have severed all dealings with Japanese banks, so there is no settlement to speak of. Foreign banks, on the other hand, largely remain the same. However, Japanese banks have procedures for entrusting foreign banks as agents, so it is slightly more than before.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices (Foreign Currency Interest) The market price of foreign currency interest rates was the same for both the morning and noon markets, at 7 qian 2 fen 5 li, which seems to be 7 hao 5 for the morning market, which seems to be 7 hao 5 higher than the noon market the day before. It is only related to business and has absolutely no impact on the current situation. The foreign currency trading situation on all exchange forward points seems to be no weaker than the previous day, which is due to bank purchases. (Silver Interest) Morning market 2 qian, noon market 1 qian 5 fen, exactly the same as the morning and noon markets the day before. Drawing head without drawing, bank listed price 8 fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions. Jiangnan small foreign currency, morning market was 6 qian 6 fen 0 half li, noon market was 6 qian 6 fen 1 half li. The result was 1 li higher than the previous noon. 5,000 jiao were traded in the morning market and 7,500 jiao in the noon market. Guangdong small foreign currency was 6 qian 4 fen 9 half li in the morning market and 6 qian 5 fen 0 hao 1 hu half in the noon market. 235,000 jiao were traded in the morning market and 100,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins remained unchanged at 375,500 wen.</p>
<p>Inflow and Outflow of Silver and Foreign Currency (Silver Funds). Yesterday's bank settlement news showed that Chinese merchants settled bills for 2.45 million, foreign merchants settled over 2 million, various cargo exchange taxes and miscellaneous items settled 8.45 million, special items over 2 million, telegraphic transfer items over 1 million, 500,000 entered the warehouse, 400,000 exited the warehouse, money shops and silver public units settled over 46 million, drawing head items settled over 3.7 million, various exchange items settled 1.2 million, and 230,000 were settled in cash. (Foreign Currency Funds) Exchange transfer bills, 2.3 million were traded in the morning market and 1.555 million in the noon market. Banknotes 150,000 in the morning market and 45,000 in the noon market. Off-site banknotes, 185,000 in the morning market and 140,000 in the noon market. Bank trading, interbank market 900,000 in the morning market and 750,000 in the noon market. Various banks settled over 2.5 million in foreign currency accounts, banknote inflows and outflows around 2 million, money shops and foreign public units settled over 4.3 million, foreign currency drawing head items settled over 1.9 million, call loan foreign currency inflows and outflows over 1.7 million, small money shop transactions over 500,000, sources 340,000.</p>

<p>After silver and money industries decided to unanimously refuse silver and goods dealings with Japanese banks and firms, which was implemented yesterday, all bills of exchange for various goods from the Japanese side have been refused for settlement. Therefore, they can only entrust foreign banks to act as agents. However, the silver and money industry still has a question about whether to settle future promissory notes that fall into the hands of Japanese merchants. Therefore, careful consideration is required before implementation. Currently, only a superficial refusal can be made. In reality, all procedures related to deposits and withdrawals with Japanese firms are difficult to end immediately. A better method must be discussed in the future to determine the direction. Securities</p>
<h3 id="e99">Bond Market Shows Signs of Turnaround <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Rebounding by 2 to 3 Yuan, Varies.</p>
<p>The securities market was lifeless the day before, with all prices still falling sharply and the market as serious as before. (September 1) The market's morale suddenly turned positive. The morning opening saw eager buyers, and all bonds rebounded consistently, with a strong trend. This is because peace with Guangdong is approaching, and the market's morale is no longer as pessimistic as before. Furthermore, the exchange limits the delivery of futures transactions to existing products, so speculation cannot be shorted, which is also a factor in promoting market stabilization. The market continued to rise later, and the trend was slightly moderate. As a result, most rebounded by around 2.5 yuan, while the 96 bonds only improved by 6.5 jiao, and salt tax rose by as much as 3.3 yuan. There were still no transactions in the November futures for various bonds. Moreover, there was almost no trading in spot bonds. Yesterday's prices, excluding the previous period's principal and interest, had fallen sharply compared to mid-September. The total turnover for spot goods was 79,000 yuan, futures 7.3 million in the morning and over 2.8 million in the afternoon, totaling 10.175 million yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cloth, Yarn Market Continues to Ease</p>
<p>The yarn market is becoming weak and the reaction is becoming more intense. Because the price of bid yarn is too high, it has exceeded the price of spot yarn, and foreign cotton is also flat and weak. As a result, the market has softened and the decline has become more severe. Therefore, the situation is complicated and difficult to stabilize. In short, Japanese yarn is difficult to circulate due to the intense movement of resistance to Japan and national salvation. Wood yarn is insufficient to meet the needs, and the future situation is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Manpower Mark Also Drops by 1-2 Liang. The pre-market opening of Manpower Mark was weak due to the poor condition of foreign cotton and people's hearts. Prices for each dropped by 4, 6, 9, and 8 qian. In the afternoon, long positions were settled, and the market atmosphere was particularly loose. Prices for each month dropped again by 1 liang, 4, 5, 6, and 7 qian. The total daily turnover was 66,100 bales. It was found that Yuda sold 1,400 bales, Rongxing 3,000 bales, Taixing 3,950 bales, Xincheng 2,250 bales, Hengde 1,700 bales, and Changfeng 1,200 bales. Gengfeng bought 3,150 bales, Shenchang 1,400 bales, Ruidong 3,600 bales, Yichang 2,850 bales, Taichang 1,050 bales, and Yiyu 1,950 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

Prices fell by 1 liang. Among customer gangs, Jiangxi entered 180 bales, the mainland entered 145 bales, Changsha entered 530 bales, Hankou entered 150 bales, Xiamen entered 80 bales, Tianjin entered 100 bales, Sichuan entered 75 bales, and miscellaneous gangs entered 100 bales, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Cotton Market Flat and Weak <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is flat and weak, and foreign cotton continues to fall, with a very dangerous situation. Spot goods have also broken the 6-fen mark. Various foreign firms in the market are peddling foreign cotton at particularly cheap prices, and various factories have purchased a lot. Therefore, domestic cotton is not in demand at all. However, general cotton merchants believe that the source of Hankou is lacking, and the standard October short squeeze is becoming more and more intense. However, the world situation is not considered at all. If prices continue to rise, the future is very dangerous, because foreign cotton can be shipped in large quantities by chance. Therefore, large speculators are extremely pessimistic about the cotton market and sell whenever it rises. Hankou Mark is Currently in Demand, Distant Soft Hankou Mark Pre-market Opening, Because Indian cotton has fallen sharply, the market atmosphere is soft again, but the near month is more stable. There is a part of the swap, so the near rose by 2 qian half, the distant fell by 5 fen. In the afternoon, the near month rose again by 5 fen, the distant fell by 2 qian half. The total daily turnover was 119,600 dan. It was found that Xincheng sold 3,500 dan, Dachang 2,700 dan, Gongtai 1,000 dan, and Gengfeng 2,100 dan. Yuda bought 4,300 dan, Tianjiang 2,400 dan, Taichang 3,000 dan, Yichang 3,600 dan, and Shenchang 2,400 dan. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e101">American Cotton Abandonment Problem <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Cotton farmers' abandonment is quite uneconomical.</p>
<p>American cotton consumption decreased in the last quarter, resulting in oversupply. The market situation fell sharply. Although the government tried its best to provide relief, it still failed to reverse this trend. When new cotton was estimated for this quarter, it was still estimated to be over 13 million bales, the decline became more intense. Recently, it has even fallen below 6 fen, breaking the new record of decades. Calls for relief followed. Recently, the original cotton abandonment of the central problem seems to be lacking in all aspects of hope. According to American news, pessimists are in the majority. If a certain cotton farmer calculates based on the following reasons, it is believed that this matter cannot be realized. The expenses incurred by farmers during cultivation are not discussed for the time being. Now, calculate the harvesting costs. Assuming that each bale of seed cotton is 1,500 pounds, the required picking fee is US$5.25, the ginning fee is $4.50, and the packing fee is $1.25, totaling $11. If the periodic market price of cotton is 6 fen, then one bale is about $24.96. Removing the cottonseed sale price of $6 from the previously calculated $11 harvesting fee, the remaining $5 is the actual expenditure of the farmer for harvesting the flowers. Removing $5 from the market price of $24.96, there is still an income of $19.96. It seems impossible to abandon cotton in this way. (Heart Farmer)</p>

<p>The Downward Trend of the Hexia Rice Market Continues to Be Fierce</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was a slight source of supply from various gangs in Nantou Market. There were particularly many new foreign sharp deliveries. Urban and rural stores sold them. It was seen that new goods continued to arrive from various routes, and there were still many old goods. Moreover, the market was cheaper, and people's hearts were calm. Not many were sold, and those that were sold had to be sold at a reduced price. Thick japonica continued to fall by 230 or so. Chen Li Yang's sharp goods sold sluggishly, so they also followed suit. Although the new japonica goods were not strong, they were not good because the broken japonica fell sharply in the stomach. Therefore, they followed suit. New reed tips followed and were repaired by 230. Bai Jiao's tips sold slowly and the falling wind was the sharpest.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of supply on the west road of the new gate was still surging. Retail sales were mostly concentrated in the top and middle grades. Broken japonica continued to be repaired by 30. Both east and west new japonica had arrivals and accumulations. The rural villages did not move. The street picked the top goods for purchase. New Li tips, new foreign tips, new group tips, new Bai Jiao tips and other goods were 40 corners lower. The change in Yuan was average for arrival and sale. The shape was stable, and foreign rice showed a soft trend again.</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Future of Foreign Rice is Going Downhill <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Return Arrow Goods Fell by 1 Qian. The Semi-New Transaction is Small by 8 Fen. Yesterday's foreign rice market conditions, spot goods were still sluggish and wooden. The unified market was only arranged by the street to deal with 300 bags at a small price of 11 yuan and 8 jiao. It was again a small number of points compared to the end of last month. The ocean companies sell a lot and try their best to solicit business, so the people's hearts are unified downward. Yesterday, the ocean companies continued to seek sales with great effort. A certain ocean company received a telegram with 50,000 tons of ships loaded from January to May, and the price was only 5 liang and 6 qian. There were no incoming customers. However, Chanshen sold 4,000 tons in March, and the price was only 5 liang and 5 qian and 7 fen. It was 8 fen lower than the previous day. Jinlong opened 1,000 tons, and the price was 5 liang and 6 qian, which was also 5 fen lower. The return of Fan goods opened 200 tons in October, and the price was 5 liang and 3 qian, which was 1 qian and half lower than the previous market. 200 tons were weighed in February, and the price was 5 liang and 6 qian and 6 fen. People's hearts were tired. If there were no unexpected changes, the market would still be expected to decline.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Great Flour Market Selling Frenzy <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening bell both morning and afternoon, the prices for all months unanimously showed a sharp decline. The price of imported wheat has not rebounded, while domestic sales have invisibly decreased. Moreover, it is reported that American wheat is already being loaded and will soon be imported. Private groups, such as factories and firms, will also import wheat in a continuous stream. As a result, most bulls, in despair, only had one option: liquidation. It is reported that many bulls were forced to cover their positions, unable to hold on or dispose of their stock. Therefore, the selling pressure was very strong, and prices for all months moved downstream. Given the current situation, it would not be surprising if it revisited the record low of one dollar and ninety-five cents. In the end, this month's price fell by two and a half cents compared to the end of last month, January fell by three and a quarter cents, December fell by three and a half cents, January fell by three cents, and February fell by two and a quarter cents. The opening price for March was two dollars and nine and three-quarters cents, and the closing price also fell by three cents, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Wheat Market Under the Pressure of Physical Goods <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the futures wheat market, after the opening bell both morning and afternoon, the prices for all months initially stabilized and then declined. This month's price was driven up by short covering, reaching a high of three dollars and sixty-six cents. However, in subsequent trading sessions, most traders remained calm and felt weak. By the afternoon opening bell, the flour market was still weak, and private estimates indicated that the amount of imported wheat due this month would be several times higher than last month. Under such pressure from physical goods, it was difficult to maintain a strong position for long. Therefore, market sentiment weakened again, and selling pressure increased. Looking ahead, a major disaster is feared. In the end, this month's price fell by three cents compared to the end of last month, November and December fell by four and one-quarter cents, and February fell by two cents. The spot wheat market remained quiet, with only packaged wheat being traded, it is said.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Refined White Granulated Sugar Suddenly Rises</p>

The price of New York sugar futures for December suddenly rose by four cents to 1.37, March remained unchanged at 1.30, May rose again by one cent to 1.34. There were also no price changes for current Java sugar futures. Transactions for Grade 24 refined white granulated sugar from the Association of Dutch Sugar were still brisk, with ordinary goods priced at eleven dollars and forty cents, and slightly higher quality goods priced at eleven dollars, forty-seven and a half to fifty cents. The buying interest was very strong, and the market appeared quite firm. Grade 20 medium white granulated sugar was priced at ten dollars and nine cents, and Grade 9 Dutch sugar was also priced at nine dollars and forty cents. Fine Dutch white sugar was priced at eleven dollars and ninety cents, with a weak trend. Taigu Sugar sold 2,000 packages of spot B grade sugar from China New at a price of twelve dollars and twenty cents, and CW grade sugar at twelve dollars and one and three-quarters cents. The trading firm's interest was very strong, and the sales were completed in an instant. The quoted price for B grade sugar was twelve dollars and twenty cents, CW grade sugar was twelve dollars and one and a half cents, and HM was eleven dollars, six and three-quarters cents. The market sentiment appeared stable, while the number board trading was quiet. Several hundred bags of Qing brand Grade 3 goods from this factory were sold by Fuxiang Company at a price of nine dollars and ninety cents, which was still considered brisk, it is said.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 800 bales of silk are being shipped to New York; 2,000 bales of American cotton have been imported; 13,000 packages of bagged sugar are being shipped to the Yangtze River; 1,000 bags of white rice are being transported to Hankou.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Baoshan Road Tragedy Amidst Anti-Japanese Protests <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Disputes Arise Over Posting Slogans</p>
<p>Many Killed and Wounded in Gunfire</p>
<p>Party, Military, and Political Organizations Investigate Together</p>
<p>You Bolu Removed from Office Pending Investigation</p>
<p>Zhabei Baoshan Road was suddenly placed under martial law starting at 9:00 PM last night. Stores closed, pedestrians disappeared, and the situation was very serious. Two bodies were lying next to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, exposed on the side of the road. From Qiu Jiang Road in the south to Tian Tong An Road in the north, armed police officers, armed with guns and live ammunition, patrolled the road every twenty steps. All vehicles and pedestrians encountered were inspected before being allowed to pass. This situation continued until midnight and had not stopped.</p>
<p>Two Dead and Five Wounded in Gunfire: Around 8:30 PM last night, a crowd of several hundred people gathered in front of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau on Baoshan Road, their numbers surging. Suddenly, a series of gunshots rang out from the crowd, and the masses retreated in confusion, fleeing from the road. At that time, two people were shot and killed on the sidewalk in front of the Public Security Bureau. Others hit by stray bullets were sent to nearby Jisheng Hospital for treatment. The names of the five who have been identified are as follows: (1) Shen Xikun, from Changzhou, 24 years old, resident of 22 Qianjili, Baoshan Road, working at Gongsheng Machinery Factory; (2) Wang Hexing, from Ningbo, 25 years old, resident of 46 Yipinli, Baoshan Road, working as a worker at Yangshupu Lian'an Electric Factory; (3) Wang Xiangshou, 60 Zhonghua New Road, coppersmith at Fuxinji; (4) Luo Fusheng, resident of Zhongzhengli, Qiu Jiang Road; (5) Zhang Baolin, resident of Zhongxingli, Zhongxing Road. Among the five, Luo and Zhang suffered minor injuries and were discharged after bandaging. Shen Xikun was shot in the left hip, the bullet did not exit, Wang Hexing was wounded in the right leg, and Wang Xiangshou was wounded in the left shoulder. The former two were transferred to Tongren Hospital for treatment, while the latter remained at Jisheng Hospital.</p>
<p>Previous Disturbances in the Fifth District: About an hour and a half before the bloody tragedy occurred, the Fifth District Public Security Bureau on Baoshan Road was overcrowded, with several hundred people gathering unexpectedly, and their numbers increasing. Traffic on the road was cut off. Minutes before the incident, while the crowd was shouting, a China Merchants Public Bus, No. 4199, was traveling south to north. When it reached the Fifth District gate, it could not pass. The driver was drawn into the whirlpool and was beaten. Amidst the chaos, someone was heard shouting for help. Armed police officers from the Fifth District rushed forward to rescue him. Shortly after, gunshots rang out, resulting in deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>Crowd Gathered in Front of the District Office: The crowd gathered in front of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau from the evening until they were dispersed after the shooting, lasting for two hours. The reason why the crowd gathered in front of the District Office was that a dispute occurred between police officers and soldiers at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Qiu Jiang Road, attracting the crowd to the Public Security Bureau. The general situation was that at around 6:00 PM yesterday, Hou Zhanyuan, a messenger from the 5th Artillery Squadron of the Railway Artillery Unit stationed at the North Station, Zhang Maocai, a orderly, and Fu Ji, a nurse, were posting anti-Japanese slogans in the Baoshan Road area. It is said that when they were posting at the Fifth District Police Kiosk at the intersection of Qiu Jiang Road, they were stopped by police officer Guo Wenhan. A conflict arose during the verbal exchange, and neither side was willing to back down. They were taken to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, causing a commotion along the way. The crowd was drawn to the Fifth District Office, and they gathered and refused to disperse.</p>
<p>Various Accounts After the Incident: The crowd gathered in front of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau for a long time. It was said that the reason was to demand the punishment of the policeman on duty at the police kiosk who caused the incident, who should be paraded through the streets or made to stand with a wooden arrow as punishment. Another version said that the crowd had heard that three Japanese people had gone to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau yesterday afternoon to discuss something, so they went to the District Office to question the reason. Regarding this point, the Public Security Bureau stated that the bureau had agreed to punish the police officer who caused the incident. The crowd did not disperse for a long time and was about to rush into the District Office, so the police fired shots to disperse them. They also said that before the shooting, everyone wanted to snatch firearms, and two pistol bullet casings were found on the ground. What the police heard was all the sound of Mauser pistols. According to the information obtained by the artillery unit, Hou Zhanyuan, who was posting slogans, was beaten in the arm by the police because the police officer prohibited him from posting slogans, which caused dissatisfaction among the crowd.</p>
<p>Two Bodies to be Examined Today: The two bodies in front of the Fifth District Office have been reported by the Fifth District Public Security Bureau to the local court for examination today. It is said that one of the dead was very young, while the other was older. The injuries were in the vital part of the head. There are bloodstains on the ground.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang Orders Investigation: Mayor Zhang Qun issued an order stating that, according to reports, a conflict occurred between civilians and district police near Baoshan Road in the Fifth District, resulting in gunshots and fatalities. As the circumstances of this case are significant, a thorough investigation should be conducted to clarify responsibilities. Therefore, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Yu Hongjun, together with Wu Kaixian, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, and Jiang Yi, the Deputy Adjutant of the Songhu Garrison Command, are hereby ordered to conduct a thorough investigation and report their findings for review and handling. This order. You Bolu Removed from Office Pending Investigation: Mayor Zhang issued an order to District Chief You, stating that You Bolu, the District Chief of the Fifth District, is hereby suspended from duty and ordered to await investigation. This order.</p>
<p>Chen Xizeng Requests Punishment: The Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Chen Xizeng, was still inspecting the area two hours before the incident. Upon hearing of the incident, he rushed back to the area to inquire about the situation. He then went to the Mayor's residence to report the incident and requested to be punished, it is said.</p>

<p>Yan Baohang Tearfully Describes the Atrocities of Japanese Soldiers in the Eastern Provinces; The Women's Circle Vows Eternal Economic Severance from Japan; The Taxpayers' Association Protests Japanese Soldiers' Demonstration; The Anti-Japanese Association Warns Unscrupulous Merchants to Repent Promptly; Chairman of the Northeast Diplomatic Committee</p>
<h3 id="e108">Heartfelt Words of Yan Baohang <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Speech: At 9:00 AM yesterday, Yan Baohang, Chairman of the Northeast Diplomatic Committee, gave a speech at the Zhongshan Hall of the Youth Association at 20 Museum Road in this city, describing the tragic situation in the Northeast. Mr. Chen Zhengfan happened to be in the audience and recorded his important report as follows: "I (Yan Baohang referring to himself) was fortunate to escape from the hands of the Japanese (the Japanese hated Yan Baohang for presiding over the Northeast Diplomatic Committee and wanted to capture him). I am very lucky to be able to come to Shanghai and meet with my fellow compatriots. My heart is filled with emotions. This time, the Japanese atrocities were a planned action. Before the outbreak, our merchants and workers who had dealings with the Japanese had already heard rumors. At 10:00 AM and 5:00 PM on September 18, the Japanese Consul used telephone calls to intimidate our local officials, saying that if the Nakamura incident could not be resolved immediately, a major change might occur. Unexpectedly, at 10:30 PM that night, the Japanese army began to move, attacking Shenyang. Within 24 hours, all the important passes in the Northeast were successively occupied by the Japanese army. If there had not been prior arrangements, how could it have been so fast? Afterwards, the Japanese side falsely claimed that our side had first provoked the war and sent troops to dismantle the railway, which was a fabricated excuse. If our side had taken such actions, there should have been some preparation. Why did we flee in panic when the incident occurred, unable to do anything? A Japanese newspaper, in haste, wrote a special report saying, "Chinese troops dismantled the South Manchurian Railway at 11:30 PM on the 18th." The Japanese army attacked at 10:30 PM, so who would believe that the Chinese army dismantled the railway? When the Japanese army occupied Shenyang, several representatives sent by the United States to attend the Pacific Conference happened to arrive there. The Japanese army interfered with their freedom of movement and did not allow them to go out for several days, constantly repeating the words "Chinese troops dismantled the railway." Their pretense can be seen at a glance. When the Japanese army attacked, our army was extremely angry and all wanted to fight to the death. However, they were under strict orders from their superiors not to resist, so they had to endure the pain and tears, letting them do what they wanted. Most of the troops escaped in panic. Those who could not escape were killed by the Japanese army. All our government offices and public buildings were destroyed. The deposits in the official treasury and the Three Eastern Provinces Bank disappeared without a trace. The ammunition in the arsenal and the aircraft in the aircraft factory (more than 200 aircraft) fell into the hands of others and were repainted. The Japanese army did not spend a bullet or a single arrow, but plundered so many spoils of war. It is truly heartbreaking. After this battle, it can be said that all the essence of the Three Eastern Provinces was lost. The Japanese army set up sentries and defenses in the city, not allowing Chinese to pass through. Chinese who detoured outside the city could be shot at will by the Japanese army if they were seen. The Japanese army was particularly hostile to Chinese wearing Western suits, student uniforms, or Zhongshan suits, and would shoot them on sight. Those who hastily changed clothes and did not look very presentable were also shot by the Japanese army. Zang Shiyi, the Chairman of Liaoning Province, has been imprisoned by the Japanese army and forced to sign a document admitting that the Chinese army dismantled the railway. However, Zang strongly refused. Before I escaped, I telephoned Zang and advised him to persevere to the end. He replied to me in a very affirmative tone, "My head can be cut off, but my will cannot be bent." He is truly a man of integrity and worthy of admiration. The Japanese side's dispatch of troops this time was nominally presided over by the Minister of the Army, not the intention of the cabinet. In fact, it was nothing more than fooling the world, so as to take a step back in the future. The Japanese's blatant dispatch of troops this time was to permanently occupy our Three Eastern Provinces. Seeing that the League of Nations and the countries of the world disapproved of what they were doing, they changed their face, bribed traitors, and made them attempt independence, waiting for a considerable amount of time before implementing annexation, just like the past events in Korea. Their intentions can be said to be extremely sinister. The most hateful people are people like Xi Qia, a group of bureaucrats, who humbled themselves and willingly acted as running dogs for the Japanese. First, they followed the instructions of the Japanese and persuaded the Chinese army to disarm (a certain battalion commander was shot dead by his guards for persuading his soldiers to surrender, which shows that the morale of our army can still be used). Then, they bowed their heads and joined forces with traitorous comrades to organize their so-called independent government, which is the greatest humiliation for our people. "Let others laugh or scold, I will be a good official." Is this what they mean? The Japanese took our Three Eastern Provinces with guns and cannons. We can only take back the Three Eastern Provinces with guns and cannons. Everything else is nonsense. The League of Nations cannot help us, and the countries of the world are also taking care of their own interests. It all depends on how hard we work ourselves. The Japanese have insulted us to the extreme this time. We have no way out and must fight to the death. Not only is it to restore sovereignty, but especially to regain our dignity. Now the situation in Japan is very bleak. The patriots of Korea are weeping bitterly, waiting for the opportunity to move. Soviet Russia has ambitious desires and conflicts of interest with Japan. If we can unite the strength of 400 million people (most of the armies of the Three Eastern Provinces are still retained, and the people of the Three Eastern Provinces are all high-spirited, vowing to fight to the death with the brutal Japanese), confront Japan to the end, persevere to the end, and economically sever ties to the end, then within half a year, major problems will definitely occur in Japan. Not only can our Three Eastern Provinces be taken back, but also all the illegal rights enjoyed by Japan in the Three Eastern Provinces can be canceled as a result. When I escaped, my family members pulled at my clothes and sobbed, stopping me from going. I told them, "Today's matter is either death or nothing else. Why cry? We may die sooner or later, but while we are not dead, we must work hard. Alas, today's matter is urgent. If we do not have the determination to die and fight to the end with the Japanese, we will eventually perish. If the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to? I hope to encourage my fellow countrymen together."</p>
<p>Telegram: Extremely urgent, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, The Japanese illegally occupied Shenyang by force on the night of the 18th. On the same day, they also invaded Yingkou, Andong, Fushun, and Changchun by force. Recently, the Siping-Taonan Railway, Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway, Jilin-Changchun Railway, Jilin-Dunhua Railway, Jilin, Yanchang, and other counties have also been occupied by the Japanese with heavy troops. Planes attacked the North-Ning Railway line at Xinmin, and Jinzhou, Goubangzi, and Dahu Mountain are under siege. The counties in western Liaoning will not be safe. The massacre and the amount of losses are the greatest catastrophe in the Northeast's history. If we continue to retreat, when will it end? If we do not quickly devise a plan, then North China and Southeast China will not be safe. The remaining half of the country, I don't know how to survive. Thinking of this, I have no tears to shed. We have lived in the Northeast for a long time and understand that the Japanese action is not something that can be resolved with words. If our people do not quickly make up their minds and fight the final battle, there is no other way out. My colleagues and I have long had the determination to "rather be a ghost under the knife than a slave to a fallen country." Therefore, we have united people from all walks of life and established the Northeast People's National Salvation Association, with the aim of uniting to resist Japan and vowing not to stop until the restoration of our complete territory. Your association is enthusiastic about saving the country and has long been admired. You will certainly take the same steps to intensify the work of national salvation. We have sent Mr. Yan Yuheng as a representative to report. All the proposals of our association will be conveyed by Mr. Yan in person. We hope that you will grant us an audience, give us detailed guidance, and introduce us to various people's organizations, so that we can work together to overcome national difficulties and save the country from danger. We earnestly express our words and look forward to your understanding and support.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Establishment of the National Salvation Grand Alliance <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>More than Two Thousand Patriotic Women</p>
<p>Pledge Economic Severance with Japan</p>
<p>Women's organizations in this city, for the purpose of resisting Japan and saving the nation, jointly organized the Women's National Salvation Grand Alliance. It was formally established yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. More than two thousand people attended, electing fifteen members and issuing declarations and circular telegrams, pledging economic severance with Japan. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Organizations: Shanghai Women's Rights League, Chinese Women's Temperance Union, Bowen Girls' School, McTyeire School, Zhiyi Middle School, Tongde Obstetrics, Minli Girls' School, Shanghai University, Qiming Girls' School, Nanyang Girls' School, Xinmin School, Shanghai Girls' School, Qixiu Girls' School, Huahua School, Women's Bank, Peiming Girls' School, Faculty of Law, Guanghua University, Baiman Girls' School, Renhe Obstetrics, Lida College, Datong University, Southeast Women's College, YWCA, Patriotic Girls' School, Guangzhao Girls' School, Jinan University, Fudan University, Women's Relief Association, Liangjiang Physical Education College, etc., more than eighty organizations. Liu Wang Liming, Yang Zheng Huichen, Lin Kecong, Wang Xiaoying, and more than two thousand others.</p>
<p>Meeting Circumstances: The presidium consisted of five people: Liu Wang Liming, Wang Xiaoying, Lin Kecong, Yang Zheng Huichen, and Mao Wang Ruizhu. Wang Xiaoying served as the master of ceremonies, Yang Meizhen as the recorder. Matters of reception and maintenance were handled by the Boy Scouts of Liangjiang Women's Physical Education. The chairman's speech: First, Chairman Liu Wang Liming delivered the opening speech, stating that the association adheres to the principle of peace, uses the spirit of struggle, and leverages the power of unity to advance the women's national salvation movement, with the aim of eliminating power politics and realizing justice. Today's meeting has three important meanings: (1) As our country suffers from natural and man-made disasters, with sixteen provinces affected and disaster relief unable to keep up, Japan is taking advantage of this situation to invade the Eastern Provinces, carrying out large-scale looting, burning down the Beidaying barracks and arsenal, and shooting innocent men and women compatriots, destroying East Asian peace. Sisters, let us unite and resist Japan to save the nation! (2) Our only way to save the nation is through economic severance with Japan. Economic severance is the greatest responsibility of women. Let us rise up with an indomitable spirit to save the nation and overthrow warlords and politicians who bring disaster to the country. (3) We will not only resist Japan, but also resist all powers that fail to uphold justice.</p>
<p>Representatives' Speeches: Lin Kecong of the Municipal Party Department said, "Dear patriotic sisters and compatriots, national demise is imminent. Only our two hundred million female compatriots can fight to the death with the Japanese invaders with blood and heads. We must realize that Japan is destroying East Asian peace, occupying our Northeast provinces, and slaughtering our military and civilian compatriots. Let us unite to save our Republic of China and strive for the survival of our nation. The League of Nations is unreliable. Two hundred million female compatriots should quickly arm themselves, recover lost territory, and abolish the Twenty-One Demands. We would rather be shattered jade than whole tiles!" (2) Chen Lengseng of the Social Bureau said, "Dear compatriots, in the midst of the calls to resist Japan and save the nation, the only way is economic severance with Japan. Economic severance with Japan requires determination and not just five minutes of enthusiasm. Our country has suffered unreasonable oppression from Japan more than once. I hope everyone will wake up, unite, and thoroughly sever economic ties with Japan to strangle the Japanese invaders. Otherwise, national demise is imminent!"</p>
<p>Election of Committee Members: (1) Women's National Salvation Grand Alliance Committee: Yang Zheng Huichen, Lin Kecong, Wang Xiaoying, Huang Shaolan, Ding Shujing, Chen Hongbi, Mao Wang Duanzhu, Zheng Zhangcheng, Zheng Yuzhi, Li Guannuan, Liu Wang Liming, Yang Xizhen, Wang Peizhen, Zhang Aizhen, Yan Shunzhen, etc., fifteen people.

<p>Oath of the Entire Body: Yesterday, more than two thousand female compatriots who attended the meeting stood up and raised their left hands. Chairman Liu Wang Liming led the reading of the oath, which stated, "I hereby follow the dictates of conscience, fulfill the national patriotic duty, and resolve to join the Women's National Salvation Grand Alliance. Adhering to the principle of peace, with the spirit of struggle, and leveraging the power of unity, we will vigorously implement economic severance with Japan to awaken them. Internally, we will strive for peaceful unification to make the country rich and strong, consistent from beginning to end, and will never break our promise. We solemnly swear!"</p>
<p>Telegram to the National Government: The association sent a telegram to the National Government in Nanjing yesterday, saying, "To the Nanjing National Government: After Japan forcibly occupied Liaoning and Jilin, it openly appointed officials and exercised administrative power, treating itself as a victorious country. Recently, it incited Manchuria and Mongolia, intending to destroy our country with the precedent of Korea. The international community is unreliable. If we do not quickly plan for resistance, the national situation will be lost. We implore the government to quickly make military preparations. Our women's community will pledge to be the backup and will not fall behind." Telegram to Guangdong: The association sent a telegram to Wang Jingwei and others in Guangzhou yesterday, saying, "To Wang Jingwei, Sun Zhesheng, Gu Yingfen, Chen Bonan, Tang Shaochuan, Bai Jiansheng, Li Zongren, and other comrades in Guangzhou: Japan's atrocities have aroused universal indignation. If this can be tolerated, national demise is imminent. The members of this association, with the rise and fall of the nation being the responsibility of every individual, are filled with fear and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we have gathered female comrades in Shanghai to unite and vigorously implement economic severance with Japan, and internally strive for peaceful unification. We believe that external aggression is rooted in internal strife. You have always taken saving the country and protecting the people as your mission. At this time of national crisis, with the survival of the nation hanging by a thread, we hope you will uphold the late Premier's will and consider the world as a public entity, merging opinions into one and concentrating forces to bravely confront external enemies and save the country from danger. We earnestly present our words and hope you will consider them." Declaration of the Assembly: The association issued a declaration stating, "Japan's ambition to covet our Northeast has not been a day or two. Now, taking advantage of our country's flooding and the season when we are unable to take care of disaster relief, they forcibly occupy our land, massacre our compatriots, trample on the Three Eastern Provinces, insult national sovereignty, and destroy international law. With great disaster looming and the nation on the verge of destruction, all of our sisters are filled with righteous indignation. Although we cannot emulate the hot-blooded men who join the army, we cannot sit and wait for death without planning for national salvation. Therefore, we have gathered comrades to launch the Women's National Salvation Grand Alliance, using the spirit of struggle and leveraging the power of unity to vigorously implement economic severance with Japan to deliver a fatal blow. Internally, we will strive for peaceful unification to forever end internal strife, taking an oath as an alliance, united in one heart. Since this association has just been established, we hope that all sisters across the country will rise up in response, refine loyalty and unity, persevere from beginning to end, and be indomitable until the purpose of this association is achieved. This is our declaration." Appendix to Incoming Letters: Yesterday, Mr. Yu Sheng sent a letter to this newspaper, saying, "Dear Editor, since Japan invaded and occupied our Three Eastern Provinces, all sectors of the country have been extremely indignant. However, our Shanghai wives, young mistresses, and young ladies are still heavily made up and flaunting themselves in the streets. Although this is said to be individual freedom, at this time, it looks as if they are too indifferent to outsiders. Your newspaper is a leading voice in public opinion. I hope you will use gentle words to add profound guidance. Yu Sheng bows in respect, October 1st."</p>
<p>Suppressing Japanese Soldiers' Demonstration Actions</p>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association Questioned the Municipal Council Yesterday</p>
<p>The Landing of Japanese Marines Should Be Stopped</p>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, saying, "Dear Sirs, according to a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the association, in response to Japan's destruction of international conventions and military occupation of our Liaoning and Jilin, convened a general meeting of all member representatives at 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month and resolved to demand more than ten items. Among them, there was a case stating 'The Japanese Marine Corps set up machine guns and conducted armed parades and demonstrations in the Hongkou shooting range and Jiaxing Bridge areas within the Shanghai Special Zone. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association should question the Municipal Council Board of Directors on the reasons for allowing it to act lawlessly.' After discussion, everyone believed that Japan dared to set up machine guns and conduct armed parades in this city, showing a kind of hostile behavior. The authorities of the concession turned a blind eye and allowed it to escalate. If an incident is provoked, who will be responsible? It was unanimously decided that your association should question the Municipal Council Board of Directors. Correspondingly, we record the case and send it to you, hoping you will investigate and handle it." Based on this, we note that (1) Under the current situation, your board is very clear about the status and nature of this boundary. (2) Japan's invasion of our country's three eastern provinces with troops is an unlawful act. Anyone with the responsibility of maintaining world peace and commerce would consider it a regret. (3) The Japanese Marines led a parade into this boundary for demonstrations. Regardless of its purpose, the board should have requested or approved it beforehand. The board should have stopped it based on the status and nature of this boundary. (4) The occurrence of the May 30th Incident and its reasons are still fresh in the memory of your board. (5) If the board does not stop the recent behavior of the Japanese Marines in this boundary based on the status and nature of this boundary, and those who are hostile to them take similar actions, will your board treat them equally? (6) If an unfortunate incident occurs as a result, will your board be responsible? The safety of this boundary is at stake, so please pay attention. In view of the aforementioned reasons, we send you this letter, hoping you will investigate and stop the landing of the Japanese Marines. The Anti-Japanese Association Warned Treacherous Merchants Yesterday</p>
<p>Prohibit Various Silk Factories from Going to Japanese Factories for Dyeing and Finishing</p>
<p>Advise Chinese People Not to Work for Japanese Institutions</p>
<p>Warning to Silk Merchants: Regarding the warning, since the Northeast Incident occurred, our compatriots across the country have been extremely indignant and have unanimously launched an anti-Japanese movement to prepare for a permanent economic severance with Japan. At this time of national crisis and intense anti-Japanese work, all our people should act according to their conscience and not be lured by profits to unanimously reject Japanese goods to achieve effective resistance. It is now discovered that Xie Feng, Xie Changxing, Rui Tai, Zhenye, Hengchangxiang and other silk shops, as well as Hongmao Silk Ge Shop, disregarding the overall situation, still dare to have their silk dyed and finished at the China Refining Factory established by the Japanese, openly transporting cars back and forth incessantly. Such a blind and pro-Japanese behavior not only violates public opinion but also abandons personal integrity, which will greatly affect the future of anti-Japanese national salvation. In addition to instructing the investigation department to conduct strict investigations, we hereby warn the merchants not to have any further dealings with the China Refining Factory established by the Japanese merchant. If they do not come to their senses and are caught by this association, they will not be tolerated. Please do not make a mistake. This is extremely important. This warning is specially issued. List of silk merchants: Xie Feng Silk Shop, Building above No. 182 Taozhuli, Second Avenue; Xie Changxing Silk Shop, Taozhuli, Second Avenue; Rui Tai Silk Shop, Mantingfang, Taiwan Road; Zhenye Silk Shop, Jin Shenfu Road; Hengchangxiang Silk Shop, Zhongdeli, Pentang Lane, Beijing Road; Hongmao Silk Ge Shop, Zhongdeli, Pentang Lane, Beijing Road. Warning to Ticket Offices: Dear Sirs, according to a letter from Zhang Huanqing, since our three eastern provinces were invaded and occupied by the Japanese, all people in the country with any blood in their veins have been heartbroken and have unanimously resisted Japan and severed economic ties. However, various shipping ticket offices still hang signs with large characters stating which ships are sailing to which destinations, which is eye-catching and willing to solicit business for the Japanese invaders, disregarding the dignity of the Chinese people. We hereby enclose a copy of the Japanese ship numbers and the addresses of various ticket offices, and request that personnel be dispatched to each ticket office to prohibit the hanging of Japanese Qing Shipping Company's sailing schedules to maintain the overall situation and calm people's hearts. It has been found that at this time of crisis when the Japanese invaders are becoming more and more aggressive, all our compatriots should act according to their conscience and vigorously implement economic severance with Japan to wash away national humiliation. However, the ticket offices disregard the overall situation and still hang signs to solicit business, willing to be slaves to the enemy. This kind of behavior not only violates public opinion and abandons personal integrity but is also despised by the people of the whole country. We hereby sincerely inform you that all ticket offices must stop hanging signs to solicit business from today. This matter is related to indignation. Please do not make a mistake. This is extremely important. Advice to Chinese People: Dear Sirs, according to a letter from Li Zhengfu, there are quite a few Chinese people working as translators in the Tongdian News Agency of Japanese imperialism. At this time when the whole country is anti-Japanese, these foreign slaves, greedy for their salaries, have not yet withdrawn and are still running dogs for Japanese imperialism's propaganda. If the agency does not have someone proficient in Chinese to translate, then the propaganda text cannot be sent to various newspapers, which would stop its function. We hereby inform your association to immediately warn the Chinese translators of the agency and order them to withdraw immediately. It has been resolved at the second regular meeting of this association that Chinese compradors in Japanese merchants and foreign firms in this city must withdraw within three days from the date of publication, otherwise they will be charged with treason. This has already been announced in the newspapers. The translators are Chinese and should not be an exception. They should share the same hatred and avenge the country by retiring and registering with the association as soon as possible. This is extremely important. This is addressed to the Chinese translators of the Tongdian News Agency.</p>
<p>Second Executive Committee Meeting of the National Salvation Association</p>
<p>Resolved to Unify the Authority to Inspect Japanese Goods. The third executive meeting of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association resolved that this association was produced by the All Circles Representatives Assembly, and its inspection department is the highest authority in the city for inspecting Japanese goods. If people from all circles or industries are enthusiastic about resisting Japanese goods and establish inspection specialties, they may be allowed to register with this association and assist this association in its work at any time, but all goods obtained through inspection must be reported to this association immediately and received by personnel dispatched by the inspection department of this association.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Merchants in Jinshan are Willing to Raise Military Expenses</p>
<p>Full Power to Resolve to Declare War on Japan</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Yesterday, it received an urgent telegram from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in San Francisco, saying, "The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is forwarded to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce for appraisal. The whole body resolved to permanently sever economic ties with Japan and sent a telegram urging Ning and Yue to reconcile and declare war on Japan. Willing to take responsibility for raising military expenses. Chinese Chamber of Commerce in San Francisco."</p>
<p>Intense Anti-Japanese Sentiment</p>
<h3 id="e110">Suggestions for Stabilizing the Market <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai's Stability Benefits All Ports</p>
<p>Restricting Price Hikes on Domestic Goods and Yarn</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce stating that in light of the disasters, prompt measures should be taken to stabilize the market, as Shanghai's stability would benefit other ports. Simultaneously, the chamber received numerous reports from its members urging a halt to opportunistic price increases on domestic goods. The chamber has notified all relevant industries, written to the Chinese Cotton Mill Owners' Association and the Cotton Yarn Trade Association, and responded to the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram from Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce to Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce: Disasters caused by floods, coupled with unexpected events in the Northeast, cast a bleak outlook on the future of commerce. Shanghai, as the hub of national commerce, and your esteemed chamber, as the guide for national merchants, should promptly devise measures to maintain market stability, adjust financial policies, and prevent illegitimate speculative endeavors during these times of turmoil. The stability of Shanghai will benefit all ports. Furthermore, promoting domestic goods is a way to counter foreign aggression. Raising prices of domestic goods is tantamount to aiding foreigners. We urge you to find ways to prevent this, in order to uphold the true intent of resisting Japan. Respectfully, Chen. A reply is requested. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce expresses its gratitude.</p>
<p>Reply to Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce: Addressed to the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce. We have received your esteemed telegram with appreciation. Your emphasis on the importance of commercial stability as the foundation for defending the nation is a wise and timeless observation. We greatly admire your insightful views. We believe that to adjust financial policies and prevent speculation, the various securities issued by the government should not be subject to rapid rises and falls. If the financial situation is stable, the market will also be stable. Since the three major banks in Shanghai allocated substantial funds to purchase securities, the situation has gradually stabilized, and we should be able to safely navigate the end of September. Regarding the prevention of opportunistic price increases on domestic goods, our chamber already resolved to prevent such practices during our general membership meeting on September 28th. We have published a notice in the newspaper starting today. If, in the future, any businesses are found to be disregarding our advice and raising prices on their own, we will publicly discuss measures to address the situation and prevent opportunistic profiteering. We hereby provide a brief summary. We hope you will consider it favorably. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, respectfully.</p>
<p>Letter to Cotton Yarn Organizations: Dear Sirs, We received a letter from Mr. Zhang Zilian on the 30th of this month, stating that the Japanese military is forcibly occupying key areas in our Eastern Provinces, and continues to provoke incidents by deploying troops in Tianjin, Dalian, Haizhou, and other places. Our nation and our people are on the verge of destruction. All of our citizens are vowing to implement their primary plan of thoroughly boycotting Japanese goods through effective methods. However, there are a few unscrupulous merchants who are living in a dream, taking advantage of this opportunity to raise the prices of domestic yarn and other raw materials, attempting to make exorbitant profits. Their heartlessness and madness are such that even consuming their flesh and sleeping on their skins would not be enough to quell public outrage. Mr. Zilian, mindful of the difficulties of the times, could not remain silent. Therefore, we are writing to your esteemed association, urging you to promptly find ways to suppress the prices of domestic yarn and other raw materials, in accordance with the spirit of resisting Japan and saving the nation. For example, 16-count yarn should not exceed 160 taels, and 20-count yarn should not exceed 170 taels. Otherwise, if prices continue to rise unchecked, small-scale industries and businesses will be burdened by the high cost of raw materials, and may not be able to wholeheartedly support the effort to resist Japan and save the nation. The impact would be immense, beyond words. Upon reviewing the matter of preventing opportunistic price increases on domestic goods, our chamber, for the sake of resisting Japan and saving the nation, convened a temporary meeting of member representatives on the 28th of this month to discuss the issue. It was unanimously agreed that during this period of intense boycott movements, domestic substitutes should be promoted at fair prices to provide support. It is absolutely unacceptable to take advantage of the situation to raise prices and enrich oneself, as this is a matter of national security. It was unanimously decided to issue notices to various trade associations, urging them to persuade their members to comply. According to the aforementioned letter, yarn is the primary raw material for various cotton textiles and is vital to the survival of domestic factories. If yarn prices increase, domestic factories will be unable to sell their products at fair prices, even if they wish to do so. Therefore, we are writing again to urge you to advise your members to comply accordingly, as this is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Business Community Vows to Reject Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Those Who Deal in Japanese Goods Willingly Accept Social Execution</p>
<p>Even Transit Permits are Invalid</p>
<p>The Fuzhou business community yesterday telegraphed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Anti-Japanese Association, stating: "Merchants in Fujian vow to reject Japanese goods. Those who deal in enemy goods willingly accept social execution. Even transit permits sent to Fujian are invalid. Please take note." The Minhou County Chamber of Commerce. It is reported that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has already informed all industries of the situation.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Greatly Affected by Boycott</p>
<p>The economic disengagement of the Chinese people from Japan has gradually become effective in recent days. If this spirit can be maintained permanently, it will not be difficult to eradicate the economic influence of the Japanese aggressors in China. We urge our compatriots to make every effort. The impact of the boycott on various Japanese ships is detailed below:</p>
<p>Yangtze River Japanese Ships Sail Empty: For thousands of miles along the Yangtze River, from Chongqing and Yichang to Nanjing and Shanghai, there is a unified boycott of Japanese ships. They carry no goods and no passengers. Workers in various ports along the river are even refusing to load or unload cargo for them. As a result, many of Nisshin Kisen's (Japan China Steamship) Yangtze River liners have suspended service. There are absolutely no goods to be loaded in Xiangtan, Yichang, and other ports. Even the Yangtze River liners, which are usually a mainstay of business, are maintaining their schedules as usual, but other than carrying Japanese expatriates withdrawing from the upper Yangtze to Shanghai and a small amount of Japanese-loaded sugar, seaweed, and textiles, there are virtually no Chinese goods or passengers. Nippon Yusen Kaisha's (Japan Mail Steamship) ocean liners traveling directly from the Yangtze River to Japan, which used to number eleven, have now been reduced to five, and many are sailing empty.</p>
<p>Rise of Russian Seafood: Japanese seafood was just beginning to be shipped this year. The first batch of over 8,900 items arrived in late August. However, after the Japanese military's violent actions began, Chinese merchants unanimously decided to stop importing Japanese seafood. As a result, Nippon Yusen Kaisha's Hokkaido Maru has been unable to load cargo to Shanghai. Russia has seized this opportunity to load seafood in Vladivostok and ship it to China to sell as a substitute for Japanese goods. The first batch of 3,250 boxes has already arrived in Shanghai, and a second shipment is being loaded.</p>
<p>Japanese Coal Ships Gradually Ceasing Operations: This time, the Chinese coal industry has stopped selling Japanese coal. After factories, docks, and ships stopped using Japanese coal, the coal-carrying ships leased by companies like Daqi and Mitsui are now unable to load coal. Leases that have expired are not being renewed. The Japanese coal ships that are already en route are rushing to Shanghai to unload. Two Japanese coal ships arrived yesterday, but it is still unknown whether they will be able to unload.</p>
<p>No Goods to Load at Various Ports: Dockworkers in Hong Kong refuse to unload cargo from Japanese ships. In anger, the Japanese caused the death of a Chinese worker found on board the Asama Maru. Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou are now responding in unison. The Japanese Ministry of the Navy has dispatched the warship Sagami to show force and has also deployed several Japanese ships to Hong Kong to carry Japanese expatriates. Recently, the Nanhua liners of Osaka Shosen Kaisha (Osaka Merchant Ship), Nippon Yusen Kaisha, and Daqi in Shanghai are no longer calling at Hong Kong, except for mail ships. Even those going to Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong are no longer docking at the wharves, but anchoring in the river. In the north, even in places like Andong and Yingkou, which are under Japanese occupation, an invisible boycott is being implemented, except for Dalian. The ports of Yantai and Tianjin are refusing to load Japanese ships. These days, Japanese ships leaving Shanghai for North China are carrying less than half their tonnage in cargo and fewer than ten passengers, a tenth of what they carried before the boycott.</p>
<p>Liaoning Provincial Association Representative Assembly</p>
<p>Meeting Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Northeast Anti-Japanese Association in Shanghai issued a notice yesterday stating: "The Second Executive Committee has decided to hold a meeting of representatives from various schools (referring to Northeast fellow-provincials) at 2:00 PM this Saturday, the 3rd of this month, at the YMCA on Sichuan Road to discuss work, communication, and publicity matters. We earnestly request that your school appoint representatives to attend at that time. Furthermore, the association has submitted a petition to the Ministry of Education on behalf of Northeast students nationwide, requesting the exemption of tuition and boarding fees for Northeast students. The original text of the petition expresses deep concern, recounting the hardships faced. The Japanese military has plans for a long-term occupation, and our homes are no longer secure. Our lives are in imminent danger. Studying far from home, we fear we will be without food. We have no way to seek assistance, and we do not know how to survive. Our finances are cut off, and our studies will be interrupted. Tears stream down our faces, and we want to kill the enemy. We request that the Ministry order all provinces and cities to exempt Northeast students from tuition and boarding fees and provide subsidies to maintain their livelihoods and prevent their studies from being interrupted, lest we become unemployed refugees, thus failing to fulfill the nation's intention to cultivate talent and the society's desire to nurture people." It is reported that the Ministry of Education has not yet approved the petition.</p>
<p>Zhou Yangshan Resigns from Japanese Firm</p>
<p>The First Chinese to Resign from a Japanese Business</p>
<p>Zhou Yangshan, the Chinese manager of the Dongchunfu Grain Store, a Japanese business in Pudong, became extremely angry after the Japanese military invaded and occupied the Northeast. He rushed to complete the matters he was handling. As of the day before yesterday, he had completely finished everything. Zhou returned to Ningbo yesterday and sent a letter to Kikuchi, the Japanese manager of the store, announcing his resignation.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Activities in All Sectors</p>
<p>The Cotton Yarn Industry Notifies Members Not to Buy or Sell Japanese Yarn: The Cotton Yarn Trade Association notified its members: "Resolutions from the temporary meeting on September 30th: (1) Prohibition of selling Japanese yarn. All members who have purchased Japanese yarn must register it with the association immediately and refrain from reselling it. (2) The Japanese goods inspection team of the Japanese goods inspection committee will be organized immediately in accordance with the inspection team regulations. (3) The association's national salvation volunteer corps notifies members to report to the association immediately to await organization."</p>
<p>Textile Society Declaration: The China Textile Society convened an emergency meeting last night. Eleven executive committee members attended, with Zhu Xianhang presiding. Several measures were discussed and decided upon, and a declaration was issued.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of the Woolen Fabric Industry: The Woolen Fabric Trade Association convened an emergency meeting yesterday, presided over by Ge Jiezhen. The members resolved: "(1) Regarding the permanent economic disengagement from violent Japan, all members are notified that they must not trade with the Japanese. A Japanese goods inspection committee was established on the spot. (2) Regarding the organization of a national salvation volunteer corps, Ge Jiezhen, Fei Rongfu, Xu Meiqing, Chen Shunan, Zhang Jinzuo, Wang Houfu, and Chen Shaoting were appointed as preparation committee members on the spot." The Bean and Rice Industry Establishes Japanese Goods Inspection Team: The Bean and Rice Industry Trade Association convened a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. As Chairman Ye Huijun had gone to Guangdong, Chen Zihui was elected as temporary chairman. Regarding the issue of resisting Japan and saving the nation, it was unanimously decided to immediately organize a national salvation volunteer corps to join in the national crisis. It was also decided to organize a Japanese goods inspection team to conduct self-inspections and notify members to refrain from using Japanese ships and Japanese docks (no Japanese goods in the first place).</p>
<p>The Hat Trade Will Inspect Japanese Goods: The Hat Trade Association held its eighth executive committee meeting yesterday. Executive committee members Fan Jingqing, Xu Senlin, Zhou Fangchen, Zhu Junfu, Yi Youlin, and Wang Jinrun attended. It was decided to organize a Japanese goods inspection committee.

Several major guidelines were determined on the spot. A meeting of all inspection committee members will be convened at 7:00 PM on October 3rd to discuss detailed measures further.</p>
<p>Proposal to Use Confiscated Japanese Goods to Aid Disaster Victims: Zhao Huanzhang wrote to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, suggesting: "In my opinion, as the weather is getting colder and the people in the disaster area are lacking food and clothing, it would be best to use the Japanese food and other items confiscated from unscrupulous merchants everywhere to aid the disaster victims. As for fabrics, they should be distributed to local girls' schools for the students to tailor into clothing and send to the disaster area." County Merchants Stop Selling Japanese Goods: The business communities in the various districts of the county have been notified by the Xing Tang, Wu Sanlin, and other chambers of commerce to all large and small merchants to stop selling Japanese goods from today onwards to show their boycott.</p>

<p>Lawyers Association Sends Telegram for Unity: The Shanghai Lawyers Association received a telegram from the Lawyers Association of the Republic of China stating: "To all lawyers associations: Our association has sent a telegram to the central and local party committees, members of the military and political officials, stating: 'To all central and local party committees, members of the military and political officials: Recently, the Japanese bandits have taken advantage of our country's natural disasters and man-made calamities, and the powers are unable to stabilize. They suddenly sent troops to invade us, occupy our Liaoning and Jilin provinces. The iron hooves have turned villages into ruins, the lives of the people are lighter than dust, officials are imprisoned and humiliated, wealth is plundered at will, justice is abandoned, and extreme cruelty is used. This is indeed unprecedented and the greatest shame of our nation. Gentlemen, you shoulder heavy responsibilities in the party and the country, entrusted with the lives of hundreds of millions of people. The cunning bandits are relying on force, and the situation is dire. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. However, in our humble opinion, if you gentlemen want to strive for the survival of the nation, you must seek domestic unity. If you want to seek domestic unity, you must thoroughly understand why there was no unity in the past and how to achieve national unity now. All party and state elders, military and political leaders, should gather in the capital, show their sincerity, obey public opinion, and jointly face the national crisis. Only then can we drive out the stubborn bandits and preserve our territory. If there is even a hint of self-interest in positions of power, failing to resolve the dispute, the great thieves will enter the house, and internal strife will arise. The danger of destruction is imminent, and it will be difficult to recover in a thousand years. Have you gentlemen ever considered this? The disaster is imminent, and the enemy is deep. Our hearts are filled with danger, and we dare not remain silent. We cry out for the nation. Please consider it. The Lawyers Association of the Republic of China respectfully. We hope that your association will uphold the same principles and work together to save the nation. We anxiously await your response. The Lawyers Association of the Republic of China respectfully.'"

<p>Chairman's Report: After reporting the purpose of the meeting, Chairman Xu Jilou continued to report on the progress of preparations, stating: "This association is organized in accordance with the Law on Trade Associations for Industry and Commerce promulgated by the National Government. It was initiated by 20 representatives from the original Shanghai Banking Association, including Mr. Bei Songsun. After being approved by the Civil Training Committee of the city party headquarters in July of this year and issued a permit, Xu Jilou, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Zheqing, Wang Zhixin, Xu Xinchu, Ye Fuxiao, and Huang Xiaotong were elected from among the initiators to form a preparatory committee. The preparatory office was temporarily established at 4 Hong Kong Road. The articles of association were drafted, and members were solicited. The work was completed in four weeks. A total of 24 banks have joined, with 106 member representatives. The draft articles of association and the roster of members have been submitted to the Civil Training Committee of the city party headquarters, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for approval and filing. All preparatory procedures have been completed. Therefore, we have convened a general membership meeting today to formally establish the association. I hereby present a brief report on the progress of preparations."</p>
<p>Representatives' Speeches: (1) Pan Gongzhan, representative of the city party headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs, spoke, stating: "Banks are the hub of the nation's finances. The national treasury relies on them for circulation, and all industries rely on them for revitalization. Their mission is of utmost importance. However, over the years, domestic warlords have been rampant, and bandits have been rampant, one after another, without a single peaceful day, resulting in the banking sector bearing a heavy burden of assisting the government in seeking peace and unification, and simultaneously having no way to develop the important task of assisting the government in construction. This is truly regrettable. Today, the establishment of a trade association by the various banks is a major unification of the banking sector. It is hoped that the banking sector will, from now on, exert its full efforts to promote national peace and unification, and on the other hand, cut off the circulation of funds to merchants who sell Japanese goods, in order to implement economic disengagement from Japan. I believe that with the power of the financial sector and the determination to act, we will surely achieve our goals." (2) Wang Yansong, representative of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, spoke, expressing his hope that the banks would consolidate their own foundations in order to promote the development of industry and commerce as much as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Three Cigarette Factories Evading Stamp Tax <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Audaciously Impersonating Japanese Businesses</p>
<p>Japanese Consulate Solemnly Declares Denial</p>
<p>Signing Search Warrants as Proof</p>
<p>A Large Amount of Tax-Evading Cigarettes Confiscated</p>
<p>Factory Premises Sealed; Factory Owners to Be Investigated</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Previously Noted That Cigarette Factories in the Shanghai Concessions Were Taking Advantage of the Fact That Chinese Tax Authorities Had No Jurisdiction to Inspect Foreign-Leased Areas. They Frequently Exported Cigarettes Without Complying With Regulations to Purchase and Affix Stamps, Resulting in a Significant Loss of National Revenue. It Repeatedly Negotiated With the Concession Authorities. Only This Year Was a Unified Cigarette Tax Investigation Office Formally Established. The Police Department Specifically Dispatched Detective Liang Bao-sheng to Assist the Office's Staff in Investigating Various Factories. Since the Establishment of the Office, There Have Been Numerous Cases of Tax Stamp Evasion Discovered, All of Which Have Been Legally Prosecuted by the Police Department Through the First Special District Court. However, the Other Day, San Long at 2764 Dong Youheng Road, Qi Ping at 558 Xinji Bang Road, and Ban Ri Da at 63 Ou Jia Road, Due to Evading Stamp Tax, Preposterously Impersonated Japanese Businesses and Refused to Allow Inspectors to Enter the Factory for Investigation. The Unscrupulous Merchants Only Care About Profit and Do Not Hesitate to Recognize Thieves as Their Fathers. The Owners of These Three Factories Can Be Said to Be Completely Heartless. Previously, the Investigation Office Learned That the Cigarettes Produced by These Three Factories Were Not Paying Taxes. It Requested the First Special District Court to Issue Search Warrants. Detective Liang Cooperated With the Investigators to Go There. Unexpectedly, Whenever They Arrived at a Factory, the Employees Claimed That the Factory Was Opened by Japanese and That the Chinese Government Had No Right to Interfere. Not Daring to Act Rashly, They Went to the Japanese Consulate for Inquiries. Subsequently, According to the Japanese Consul General's Solemn Declaration, San Long, Qi Ping, and Ri Da Factories Were All Established by Chinese and Were Protected by Japanese Businesses, Not Purely Japanese Businesses. Because the Factories Had Already Refused Investigation, in Order to Facilitate the Investigators, the Consul Signed the Search Warrants Issued by the Special Court. Detective Liang and Others Then Went Again and Were Finally Able to Enter the Factories to Inspect the Cigarettes Produced and Stored in the Factories One by One. It Was Found That San Long Factory Had Evaded Stamp Tax on 97 Cartons of "You Yi An" Brand, 92 Cartons of "Duo Zi" Brand, 98 Cartons of "Sai Gou" Brand, 12 Cartons of "Jin Chai" Brand, 1 Carton of "Nu Er" Brand, 198 Cans of "Hua Qiang" Brand, 50 Cans of "Jin Shi" Brand, and 130 Boxes of "Wu Di" Brand, as Well as Three Relevant Account Books. Ri Da Factory Was Found to Have 427 Cartons of "Pao Chuan" Brand, 96 Cartons of "Shi Shi" Brand, One Basket of "Mei Mei" Brand, and 14 Account Books. Although No Cigarettes Were Found in Qi Ping Factory, 27 Account Books Were Found, All of Which Were Important. They Were All Taken to the Relevant Harbin Police Station Along With the Factory's Machinery. When the Factory Owners' Names Were Inquired, the Factory Employees Kept Them Secret and Only Claimed That They Were Not in the Factory. Yesterday Morning, the Police Station Reported the Search Process and the Types of Items to the Special Court. Lawyer Qian Xun-jiu Also Appeared in Court to Request That the Confiscated Tax-Evading Cigarettes and Other Goods Be Temporarily Stored by the Police Station. The Premises of the Three Cigarette Factories Were All Sealed. The Factory Owners' Names Will Be Investigated and Another Request Will Be Made to Issue Arrest Warrants and Investigate the Case. Judge Cheng Shang-feng Approved the Three Points Requested by the Police Station in Court and Ordered That They Be Handled Separately.</p>

The Doctors Used Bone Setting and Various Surgeries to Treat Him. The Criminals in the Case Could Not Be Found, and the Case Has Been Suspended Until Now for Three Years. The Other Day, Chinese Detective Liu Bao-shan and Chen Ou-hai of the Zhabei Police Station Arrested Two Criminals, Jiang Miao-lin From Tongzhou and Chen Zi-ming (Nickname Xiao Lai-tou), From Ningbo, on Broadway Road, Seward Road and Brought Them to the Police Station for Detention. Yesterday Morning, They Were Escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. According to Lawyer Zhang Tian-yi of the Police Station, Jiang Miao-lin Admitted in the Police Station That He Was Invited by the Fugitive A-tang and Two Others to Commit the Crime, While Chen Zi-ming Was Also Obtained by His Confession. Therefore, the Confession Was Submitted for Inspection and a Request Was Made for a Postponement. Subsequently, The Victim He Xiao-di Claimed That Although His Foot Had Healed, He Had Difficulty Walking and Was Half-Paralyzed and Showed the Severe Scars. However, Both Defendants Could Not Recognize Whether They Were at the Scene at That Time. However, The Words of Chen A-tang, the Leader of the Criminals, Were Obtained Afterwards for Verification. Jiang Miao-lin Confessed That He Was Invited by A-tang to Help and He Did Not Go Upstairs But Watched From the Side of the Escalator. There Were Five People in Total. The Remaining Confessions Were Evasive, While Chen Zi-ming Confessed That He Had No Mange Head and That He Did Not Go Together for This Case and That He Did Not Know Tang. Detective Liu of the Police Station Said That When Chen Was Arrested, Jiang Pointed Out That He Was the Mange Head. After Verifying, Judge Shen Bing-rong Ordered the Two Defendants to Be Returned to Custody to Wait for a Change of Date to Be Investigated and Interrogated Again.</p>

<p>Claiming Damages for Breach of Contract</p>
<p>Hong Kong Lianhua Film Company, Represented by Lawyer Kuang Qiguang, Filed a Statement With the Mediation Court of the Second Special District Court, Claiming That the Plaintiff Entered Into a Contract With Film Star Yang Nai-mei on April 18 This Year in Hong Kong, Whereby Yang Was to Act in Four Films for the Plaintiff's Company, With a One-Year Time Limit. Article 4 of the Contract Stated That During This One-Year Period, Yang Was Not Allowed to Hold Any Positions With Other Film Companies or Record Companies. After Signing the Contract, the Plaintiff Incurred Huge Expenses for Various Equipment, Such as Renting Houses and Advertising. Subsequently, the Defendant Borrowed 300 Yuan From the Plaintiff, Came to Shanghai Privately, and Entered Into a Contract With Tianyi Company. After the Plaintiff Found Out, He Sent a Letter to Discuss It, But She Completely Ignored It. Therefore, He Filed a Statement Requesting Mediation, Demanding That the Defendant Compensate for All Losses of 5,400 Yuan. Yesterday, Judge Long Shu-rong Summoned Both Parties to Open a Court for Mediation. First, the Plaintiff's Agent Lawyer Stated the Facts. Yang Nai-mei Was Interrogated and Said, "Before I Entered Into a Contract With the Plaintiff, I Explained That I Had to Go Elsewhere to Perform. At That Time, the Plaintiff Agreed to It in Person, So I Came to Shanghai. After I Entered Into a Contract With Tianyi Company on September, I Sent a Letter to the Plaintiff Requesting to Terminate the Contract. Now I Don't Know Why I Suddenly Came to File a Complaint. But What I Earn Every Year Is Only More Than 3,000 Gold, Where Did Such a Huge Amount of Compensation Come From?" The Judge Asked, "What Do You Mean, Are You Willing to Compensate a Certain Amount?" Yang Replied, "I Am Willing to Return the Outstanding Amount." The Judge Also Asked the Plaintiff's Agent Lawyer, "What Is the Minimum Amount That Can Be Allowed?" Lawyer Kuang Replied, "At Least 4,000 Yuan." The Judge Ruled That the Difference Between the Two Parties Was Too Great. At This Point, Both Lawyers Claimed That the Case Should Be Postponed Temporarily So That Both Parties Could Go Out and Reconcile. The Judge Approved It.</p>

Usually, She Got Along Fairly Well With Her Brother and Sister-in-Law. Half a Month Ago, She and a Female Lodger Went to a Cigar Factory to Learn Women's Work. Because It Was Too Far From the Factory, She and the Woman Rented a Straw House Next to the Factory to Avoid Trekking Back and Forth. They Spent More Than 20 Yuan on Tables, Chairs, Bedding, and Other Items, Stating That They Would Share the Burden Equally. Later, Jin-xiang Was Still 6 Yuan Short to the Woman, and They Had a Disagreement at Around 3:00 PM Yesterday Afternoon. Subsequently, They Were Persuaded by Their Companions, and the Matter Ended. Unexpectedly, the Matter Was Known to Jin-xiang's Brother That Day, and He Immediately Rushed to His Sister's Place and Blamed Her for Not Being Alone Outside and for Causing Extra Problems. So He Returned Home With His Brother. Jin-xiang Was Unable to Vent Her Anger for a While and Suddenly Had Suicidal Thoughts. She Secretly Took Raw Opium to Commit Suicide.

<p>This year's National Day will be marked with mourning due to national difficulties, and there has been talk of suspending operations in various entertainment industries. Yesterday, it was learned that the Central Film Company received news from Nanjing that the so-called suspension of entertainment refers to entertainment associated with National Day celebrations. However, privately-run entertainment venues can still operate as usual. Therefore, the film company's theaters have decided to operate as usual on that day and will screen excellent domestically-made films. The Central Government has decided to screen "Shadow of Red Tears," the latest release from the Mingxing Film Company, directed by Zheng Zhengqiu and starring Hu Die, Zheng Xiaoqiu, and Xia Peizhen. The plot is intricate and well-structured, and the performances are extremely delicate, making it a rare masterpiece among recent domestic films.</p>

<p>The event of the recent Japanese aggression against our Northeast has been heard and seen by all the people of the country. Anti-Japanese conferences have been convened by many groups and organizations, and various proposals have been made endlessly. If all the proposals could be thoroughly implemented, I dare say that the Japanese aggressor troops would withdraw without being forced to do so. However, I wonder how long the enthusiasm of our Chinese people can last, and whether it will add to the heat of the Japanese artillery fire. I sincerely hope that the organizers of this anti-Japanese association in various groups will not be driven by a slight pursuit of fame, will not wear a sheep's head while selling dog meat, and especially will not put on the airs of some committee member. Also, I hope that some merchants will not take advantage of this boycott of Japanese goods to raise the prices of domestic goods and profit from it. Without further ado, I would like to offer a few suggestions with the utmost sincerity to the gentlemen in the publicity department of the anti-Japanese association, but I don't know which is the main organization to submit them to, so I have to borrow the correspondence column of your newspaper to introduce them. If they are published, I will be fulfilling my duty as a citizen, and I will be very grateful. (1) Erect tall billboard-like structures in the thoroughfare areas, specifically writing various anti-Japanese slogans, and using colored lights at night to make them easily noticeable to pedestrians. (2) Erect similar signs on the Huangpu Riverbank, also writing various anti-Japanese slogans, and also equipped with electric lights at night. It would be even better if red arc lights could be used to highlight the characters of important slogans. As for all electricity used in the Chinese-controlled areas, request the assistance of the Chinese Electrical Company. (3) Each cinema, if operated by Chinese, should add anti-Japanese slogans and various tragic pictures or photos before each screening. (4) Write anti-Japanese slogans in the passageways of various amusement parks. The above four points are intended to make it easy for the public to pay attention and to be easily moved, so this relatively costly method is used, but it is more durable, unlike paper slogans that can be destroyed at any time.</p>
<p>(Reply) Very good, we will publicly disclose your letter in the newspaper for publicity reference.</p>

<p>Since Japan suddenly launched its ambitions, the whole country has been aroused with anger and indignation. But I am very fortunate. Just think, in recent years, how much blood and sweat have the people shed, and how much money has been spent on mutual strife? How much hot blood have the patriots shed, and how many heads have the soldiers thrown away? What has been gained except that the whole country is full of bandits, and the people's burden has been increased? Freedom of speech has turned into daring to be angry but not daring to speak out, and no true public opinion can be expressed. Now Japan has occupied the Northeast without declaring war. Mr. Chu Minyi said, "If the country is governed by the party, people will say that the country will be destroyed by the party." Elder Ma Xiangbo said, "Hubei attacks Hunan, Guangxi attacks Guangdong, they are originally brothers fighting each other, how can there be any gains or losses to speak of?" In the past twenty years, the wars have been cyclical and exactly the the same. Alas, what the people did not dare to say, now the elder speaks of it with emotion. What the members of the Central Committee should not say, now member Chu frankly says it. The Guangdong side withdrew its troops from Hunan, abandoned suspicions, and jointly resisted foreign aggression. If the Japanese troops had not acted violently at a time of internal correction, would there be such news? Would there be such advice and medicine to be heard? It is said that, "A country without enemy nations and external troubles often perishes." Isn't this the starting point of a country's revival in times of great difficulty? Speaking of resisting the enemy, apart from self-salvation, do we still want "international" and "covenants" to help our country that is brave in private quarrels and cowardly in public wars? (Omitted below)</p>
<p>(Reply) Your opinion is激烈, but it is indeed from a sincere heart. Saying that there is no other way to resist the enemy than self-salvation is also a perfectly reasonable statement. However, we cannot agree with the following, and it is greatly contradictory to your self-salvation doctrine. You should reconsider, and you will think so too.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Message from Mu Tieqian (The Question of Joining the Student Volunteer Army) <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Since the Japanese pirates violently invaded the Eastern Provinces, all schools have organized volunteer armies. All young people with blood and qi, who do not want to be slaves of a conquered nation, have thrown away their pens and followed. But I am a student, and I cannot be completely independent, because my daily actions must be reported to my parents. Yesterday, because the school needed to organize a volunteer army, I planned to join and specially reported it to my strict father for discussion. My strict father told me that the biggest problem in China in recent years is that students have forgotten that they are students and must bear the responsibility of studying. They often interfere in foreign affairs and neglect their studies, so the country cannot cultivate high-level talents and noble personalities, leading to mutual strife and breeding sources of chaos, which is very worrying. This organization of the righteous army is certainly not opposed, but after careful study, the task of killing the enemy and achieving results should be left to the heavily armed national army, and the number of our country's troops is very large. If the army can be reorganized and strengthened, the strength to defend the country will be more than enough. Moreover, young students mostly possess noble knowledge, but their physique is relatively weak. Now, instead of using their useful brains to study hard to save the country (as Germany and France still had classes during the Great War), they use their fragile bodies to serve in the battlefield, fearing that they will die before they kill the enemy. However, the current trend does not allow the elderly to have a say, because the research and discussions proposed by the elderly are often denounced by the youth as being outdated and decadent, and at this time, if they do not agree, they will be reproached as being slaves of a conquered nation. I cannot make this decision for you, you should still decide for yourself. After carefully considering my strict father's words, they are quite reasonable. However, given the current trend, if I do not join the organization, I will be reproached as being a slave of a conquered nation. I am very hesitant about this matter. I hope that you can enlighten me.</p>
<p>(Reply) It is very good that you join the volunteer army, but the high opinion of your father is indeed a perfectly reasonable statement. We will never force you to let you make your own decision. Your father is wise. The ancients said, "It is a joy to have a wise father and brother," it is truly rare. However, there is one point that still needs to be studied. Joining the volunteer army is enough to show patriotism, which is true. It is not correct to say that not joining the volunteer army means that one is willing to be a slave of a conquered nation. There are many ways to save the country, such as studying science, which is also one of them. During the European War, Edison's various inventions in science were no less meritorious than Foch and Joffre. It is extremely important for ambitious young people to study hard to save the country and to serve in the military to save the country. It is hoped that you will follow your father's orders and make your own decision carefully. However, if you are determined to study hard to save the country, you must still seriously exercise your body, and if there is an opportunity, you must also receive military training in your spare time, so that you can be effective when you have to go to the battlefield together.</p>

<p>Japan is using its power to seize our land. Compatriots, please see what time it is in China now! Our country's shame is our compatriots' shame. How should we deal with it? First, let us regard our China as a family, and everyone should treat each other as brothers, work together with one heart, revitalize the spirit of the nation, embrace the determination to strive, and work together to resist foreign aggression. Take the four characters of "resist foreign aggression" as China's border defense. Scholars must do their best to be leaders of the people and guide them. Farmers must work hard to increase food production and provide the army with food and salaries. Workers must work hard to increase production and provide the army with what it needs. Merchants must not import Japanese goods. Soldiers must desperately kill the enemy and regard the enemy as having an irreconcilable feud with them, either winning or dying. When the army is short of soldiers, then all the people of China should have the obligation to be soldiers, and the number of soldiers can be increased at any time, until there are 400 million soldiers. We would rather be ghosts resisting under power than slaves of a conquered nation under fire. If the Chinese people have this spirit of unity against foreign aggression and the determination to strive, China will be saved.</p>
<p>(Reply) Your proposal is very good, but these words have recently become 口頭禪, it is hoped that they will be put into practice in the future, and everyone should start from their own home.</p>

<p>— Dujuan</p>
<p>Dear compatriots. Do you think that you are unarmed and not enough to kill the enemy and save the country? In fact, everyone has an extremely powerful weapon in their hands, which is more powerful than any dumdum bullet, machine gun, or mortar. As long as 400 million people in the country persevere, within three years, they will definitely be able to control the enemy's fate. This is more reliable and cost-effective than engaging in open warfare. What is this weapon? It is the determination to boycott Japanese goods! If you don't believe me, let's all work together with one heart and do it earnestly from today. Three years from today, let's go and see the overbearing Japanese.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Wartime Curriculum <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>These past few days, students want to strike, but the principal doesn't want them to. This contradiction probably stems from a misunderstanding, right? In my opinion, there is a peacetime curriculum and a wartime curriculum in schools. The principal and students should discuss and decide on a reasonable and effective solution. I think the reasonable and effective solution is:</p>
<p>"Suspend the peacetime curriculum, and start the wartime curriculum."</p>
<p>The tigers and wolves have already entered the house to eat people. Instead of teaching the children to use their true skills to rescue their beloved sisters, the teachers still want them to read dead books, reciting poetry and Confucian sayings. This shows that they are out of touch with the times. The children are dissatisfied with the teachers' calmness and run around empty-handed, shouting for help. By the time their mouths are dry from shouting, the family has already been eaten clean, and they themselves will inevitably satisfy the tigers and wolves. This is also not progressive. So what is the best course of action? Although the peacetime curriculum should be suspended, the wartime curriculum must be started. Moreover, not only students but all citizens should immediately start the wartime curriculum. The wartime curriculum is not about shouting a few slogans of patriotic clichés, nor is it about wielding wooden guns and learning some martial arts clichés of standing at attention and marching. We must take the true wartime curriculum to gain the true skills to respond to the war.</p>
<p>What is the wartime curriculum?</p>
<p>(1) Men should arm themselves with real weapons and learn emergency warfare; (2) Women should arm themselves with real weapons and learn nursing; (3) Publicize and implement economic severance with Japan; (4) Study Sino-Japanese trade; (5) Revitalize domestic industry and manufacturing to replace Japanese goods; (6) Study Japan; (7) Study the Three Eastern Provinces; (8) Study the international situation; (9) Specialize in natural sciences to lay the foundation for production and national defense; (10) Vigorously carry out the mass literacy movement so that people know that the Republic of China is a country that is jointly owned, jointly governed, jointly enjoyed, and jointly protected by 400 million people; (11) Vigorously carry out science education in primary schools to create scientific children to build a scientific China twenty years from now so that China will forever stand in an invincible position; (12) Restore land destroyed by floods so that it can be planted in time to provide food for the people. These twelve courses must be carried out in a division of labor and cooperation according to each person's nature. From today onwards, we must ask ourselves:</p>
<p>"If Japanese bandits come tonight, how will we defeat them?"</p>
<p>This question is not out of fantasy. Shenyang fell in this way. Since the Japanese army can come to occupy Shenyang in this way, it can also come to occupy Shanghai outside the concessions, occupy China Public School, occupy Hengfeng Yarn Factory, occupy Zhenru Village, and occupy Xu Gong Bridge. Do we still follow Zhang Xueliang's example of avoiding conflict, or do we follow Shi Kefa's example of fighting to the death? You should make a decision quickly.</p>
<p>Today, the government must trust the people and believe that the people have the power to save the country. The government must eliminate all doubts and help the people arm themselves to create a great volunteer self-defense army that only defends against foreign aggression and does not participate in internal wars. If you still dream of using a government armed with a mob as a backer to confront the iron-blooded Japanese, there is no chance of survival. A matter of life and death is right in front of us. There is no need to talk more. Arm yourselves and get to work!</p>

<p>— Wu Jun</p>
<p>The Textile Times, published by the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, translated and reprinted the report of the British Far East Commercial Survey Mission. It greatly praised Japan's education, saying that its citizens are instilled with national thought from childhood. For example, the Tokyo Kindergarten</p>
<h3 id="e149">Recent Events: New Sentiments and Waste <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The great land of China is drifting in the wind, brewing from dusk to morning. Man-made disasters and natural disasters are piled up. Suddenly, I heard that the great thief stole Dongliao. The revolution was successful, and the strategy was proud. Domestic infighting continues. When disaster strikes, I realize. The Second Hunan Army throws down their arms and hopes for shared hatred. The struggle for power and profit is seen as different. The documents are devious, this outstanding person. For twenty years, the iron threshold has been crossed. The muscles are exhausted, and I look back within the walls. Free speech easily invites suspicion. No one dares to speak out honestly. There are many flattery literary works, only knowing how to sing praises and not knowing how to admonish. There is no justice under power. How can a weak country have good diplomacy? No wonder the people of Qi love powder and paint. They only use concession to face roaring. The flames of Wan Shifeng are fierce. Following the old ways is foolish. If the two evil stars invite Heaven's favor. I will take the road along the river to avoid the enemy's sharp edge. Cannons are perfected, and weapons are well-made. I will pack up the Japanese sack with a single load. Such a large and powerful arsenal is built. It is making wedding clothes for others. The white mountains and black waters are not intact. When the alarm comes, the swords and spears are fired. A treaty under the city cannot be sought. You gentlemen shed new tears in vain. Building houses by the roadside is debated in the court. The dreams of allying with America and Russia have not yet awakened. I would say to the imperial envoys. Who will weep in the court for seven days? Raising the flag in Hunan brings disaster. Suppressing and killing the people is better than appeasing and recruiting. Proclaim justice and set an example. Transform fierceness and prevent heaven's calamity. Exhausting my strength and shouting hoarsely, I rely on the League of Nations. The small court hopes for security. It is said that resistance is truly powerless. It is difficult to calm the troops and issue orders. There is no other way than to endure. Respect and concession come first in governing the country. The odds of winning in the last five minutes. My people are listening to the wind. Public debt has been accumulating for years. Public funds are misused, and others do not know. The fund is used to save the country. The name should be marked as attacking the violent Japanese. Students love the country and strive to 충. Military research is urgently needed to whip. This country is about to be completely lost. Turning back the tide is hoped for by the youth. I chant the poems of 感事 alone. Where can I find a soulmate for my gratitude and hatred? The old man also has a responsibility for the rise and fall of the country. Little children cry and beg to save the country. My heart</p>
<p>The "Our Tokyo Song" sung by the children in the kindergarten. The lyrics are as follows. (According to this translation)</p>
<p>(1) Our Tokyo is the best capital in Japan. Please tell me, who built this city for me? It goes without saying that it was created by our ancestors. It was created by our ancestors. (2) Our Tokyo is the best capital in the East. (Same as above)</p>
<p>(3) Our Tokyo will also be the best capital in the world.</p>
<p>Please tell me, who will promote its success? It goes without saying that this is our responsibility. This is our responsibility.</p>
<p>The short words are awe-inspiring and develop the spirit of patriotism and enterprise in children unconsciously. The method is very good. Today, in primary schools in our country, every week during the memorial week, the students always read the Prime Minister's will, sing the party song and the school song. Senior primary school students can understand the meaning of the will and the lyrics. However, junior primary school students follow the crowd to sing and read without knowing what they are saying. (For example, the phrases "咨尔多士" and "夙夜匪懈" in the party song are mostly incomprehensible even to adults.) Although they will be able to understand after they grow up a little, it seems that extremely shallow lyrics should be added to make up for their deficiencies in these years when they are limited by age and cannot understand.</p>
<p>Now that the Japanese pirates are rampant and the country is in difficulty, in the short term, I am afraid that there will be no day to turn the tide. Ten years of recuperation, ten years of training, and revenge in the future will greatly depend on the primary school students of today. To make them understand the national humiliation, there is nothing better than short lyrics. I think it is urgent to solicit national humiliation songs from primary school students and publish them in newspapers. Then, please ask people to make a fair evaluation and select one of them. Then, ask musicians to compose a song and a tune. From then on, all primary schools, whether public or private, must sing this national humiliation song after reading the will and singing the party song during the memorial week. Then, the patriotic thoughts of primary school students can be aroused unconsciously. However, the words should be shallow and the purpose should be solemn, and there should be no fierce atmosphere. This national humiliation folk song should be broadcast among the people, and every household should recite it. Everyone will have the thought of national humiliation, and the effect will definitely be far greater than posting slogans and calling out slogans. It would be even better to make it into a song and ask a record company to make a record. Then the broadcast can be wider and faster.</p>
<p>The Japanese Aggressively Occupy the Three Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>The Gentlemen Abandon Their Guns and Strive</p>
<p>It is embarrassing to say that most Chinese compatriots know that opium is very harmful. In recent years, they have been loudly calling for and stepping up the anti-drug work. It seems that there should be some results. However, black poison comrades are still everywhere. Especially in Shanghai, even young girls can get a few puffs of opium. The fact is so, and it is undeniable. Yesterday, I was looking for a friend and went to his house. His wife said, "He has been feeling unwell these days and often goes to the opium den on the third floor of a certain lane in a certain street," "Feeling unwell and not taking medicine to recuperate, but smoking opium, it's really laughable," I thought to myself, and walked there. Before I even entered the door, a disgusting opium smell had already entered my nostrils. As soon as I stepped in, I saw my friend. I greeted him, but he seemed not to hear me. He was sitting on the edge of the bed, happily discussing the current affairs of the national crisis and discussing it with two other people. He was actually very慷慨激昂, and the atmosphere was very tense. I paid attention and listened. Japan is a small island country. No matter how fierce it is, we can beat them if ten of us fight one of them," "How easy is it? How is the training of our troops? How is the armament? And how is the quality of the people?" "Don't increase the arrogance of others and diminish your own prestige," "I will definitely join the national army tomorrow," "Very good, take the opium pipe as a branch and fight a war, and even the old 洋鬼子 will not be able to kill you," "Stop it, opium is not human. Let's first make a decision to quit opium and be the government's support," "Speaking of quitting opium is really a difficult thing. I have tried it several times, what Western medicine, what secret recipes, are all useless. 断命烟 is really harmful." At this time, another young man in a suit jumped up from the bed and said, "No, no, to be honest with you, I am a doctor who has an opium addiction and also helps people quit opium. I have always helped people quit opium, and three or four out of ten can be effective, but I can't get rid of it myself. Recently, I have been using 大孚赐保命佐射液 to help people quit opium, and it has been like picking up snails with three fingers, very sure. So I tried it myself, and sure enough, my spirit is getting stronger day by day. Although I deliberately smoke every day, the amount of smoke is decreasing day by day. From this day on, when I smoke, my mouth doesn't feel anything," "Really?" "Who is lying to you? I am not doing business. If you really want to quit opium, you can go to the pharmacy near the Nanjing Road Ball Park to buy two boxes of 大孚赐保命 and ask a famous doctor to inject it, and I can guarantee that you will get rid of opium completely and have no future troubles," "Since this is the case, let's make a decision to quit opium today. Let's all go to 盛昌药房 to buy 大孚赐保命, (Unfinished finished)</p>

<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Severing economic ties with Japan: We must persevere to the end. Everyone can sing these two high-sounding phrases. However, past experience tells us that each boycott of Japanese goods has always started with a bang and ended with a whimper. We have never been able to strike a fatal blow to the Japanese, which is extremely regrettable. In the minds of the Japanese, they think, "The Chinese's boycott is just a five-minute fad." Alas, we ourselves have revealed our true colors. Our paper tiger has been exposed by them. What else can we say? But the severity of this incident is different from the past. The determination of the people of our country has improved a lot. Now, we should express our condolences for the past incomplete and thorough boycotts. From now on, the 400 million compatriots should stand under the clear sky and white sun, close our eyes and reflect, and touching our hearts, silently recite three times, "If I buy Japanese goods again, I will not be human and deserve to die." Since boycotting Japanese goods is the common resolve of 400 million people, we must also prevent cheating. Therefore, I have strengthened my own principles. As for others, we must encourage and supervise each other. Only with the concerted efforts of everyone, from beginning to end, can we achieve our goals. As for specific measures to be taken after the boycott begins, the following points are for reference.</p>
<p>(1) Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Associations in various places should become permanent organizations, tightly organized, and consistent from top to bottom. We can imitate the organizational system of the Kuomintang. A national general association should be established in the capital or Shanghai, with branch associations in each province and sub-branch associations in each county. A national representative assembly should be convened in the short term to decide on all policies and implement a general mobilization order to sever economic ties with Japan.</p>
<p>(2) Shanghai should first set up a Japanese Goods Exhibition Hall to display all kinds of Japanese goods. Various merchants should voluntarily send their remaining Japanese goods to be used as specimens, or the Anti-Japanese Association should send all the confiscated Japanese goods to the exhibition hall. All Japanese goods should be available. These goods should be clearly marked with their place of origin, manufacturing method, use, and price. If there are domestic substitutes, they should be noted. Otherwise, European and American products should be temporarily annotated.</p>
<p>(3) After the establishment of the Japanese Goods Exhibition Hall, it should be fully open and anti-Japanese goods exhibitions can be held. Firstly, to let everyone know the true nature of Japanese goods and no longer confuse them with domestic and Western goods. Secondly, to provide industrialists with a basis for research and improvement. Thirdly, entrepreneurs will know which daily necessities are most needed and set up factories to manufacture them first. These meanings are very profound.</p>
<p>(4) Merchants should be subject to the constraints of their own conscience and beware of national punishment. They should thoroughly realize and never buy or sell Japanese goods again. However, I have already discovered two unfortunate facts. Some traitors are secretly entrusting foreign merchants to import cheap Japanese goods with obliterated marks, and then buying them from foreign merchants, using indirect sales methods to seek personal gain. There are also several foreign goods stores that are currently holding large sales of Japanese goods. These cold-blooded animals truly deserve to be punished by heaven and earth. Why doesn't the Anti-Japanese Association conduct a thorough investigation?</p>
<p>(5) We should not only start boycotting Japanese goods ourselves, but also do our best to publicize it to the people. Even in remote rural areas, every household should be informed. In fact, remote rural areas generally use domestic goods. However, we should take this opportunity to spread the atmosphere of resisting Japan and saving the nation among the people.</p>
<p>(6) There are many ways to expand publicity. For example: 1. Make badges that say "Do not buy Japanese goods" for everyone to wear. 2. Float balloons with slogans in major cities. Floating in the sky, they are most eye-catching. 3. Erect slogan boards next to market centers, stations, and wharves, focusing on national salvation pictures. 4. Add slogans to various vehicles. 5. The post office should stamp anti-Japanese and national salvation seals on letters, and the same should be done with stationery and envelopes.</p>
<p>(7) No longer hire Japanese people, nor be hired by Japanese people. Adhere to the principle of absolute non-cooperation. Japanese commercial firms will not have Chinese people to serve as compradores, staff, or errand runners. In short, Chinese people will no longer be their lackeys. Japanese goods will naturally have no way to be sold. At the same time, block the import and export of Japanese goods. If these points are achieved, the effect of the boycott will be 70% mature. If we are determined not to take Japanese trains or ships, then the South Manchurian Railway and the South China, North China, and Yangtze River Japanese liners, which are in the hands of the Japanese and have encroached upon our offshore and inland river navigation rights, will go empty. In this way, the final victory will still belong to us.</p>
<p>Brief news: The shareholders of the Shanghai Maritime Exchange Brokerage Firm will perform a play at the Ren Stage on this star news day (i.e., the 4th) to help with the flood relief. The proceeds from the play will be used for disaster relief. The plays are: Dai Yulin and Wu Laopu's "Golden Stage," Li Nengchuan and Gong Zhaoxiong's "Linked Rings," Zhao Peixin and Cao Liang's "Four Mount Pans," Dong Zhengqing's "Yan Yang Tower," Guo 's "Chasing Han Xin," Xue Liangjun's "Nanyang Pass," Shi Yunying and Zhu Ruying's "Nengren Temple," and Li Baishui's complete "Extraordinary Injustice Reported." All are masterpieces, it is said.</p>

<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>As soon as he entered the Zen room, they sat down as host and guest; he immediately felt a burst of taro fragrance penetrating his nose, as if it had just come out of the pot. A young monk brought a cup of strong tea; Tao Chi, holding the teacup in his hand, looked around at the various arrangements in the Zen room, which were truly spotless; apart from the scriptures, bells, and chimes, which were all present, there was a unique chair made of a thousand-year-old tree root in the middle, with three ancient seal characters engraved on the back, named "Turning Wheel Chair"; this made Tao Chi secretly wonder: "Why is this chair called a Turning Wheel Chair? There are no wheels, it just sits there motionless, it won't turn even in a hundred years."</p>
<p>The elder had already guessed Tao Chi's meaning:</p>
<p>"Layman, are you wondering about this turning wheel chair? You think that a thousand-year-old tree root will not turn; who knows that when it doesn't move, it's fine, but when it moves, it's faster than the Earth's rotation by a million times. This is an incredible turning wheel chair!"</p>
<p>"Old monk, what you say is truly incredible."</p>
<p>"If the layman doesn't believe it, I can ask you to test this incredible turning wheel chair in a moment." While the monk and layman were talking, the young monk had already brought a plate of hot taro, fresh from the pot. The elder then invited Tao Chi to taste the flavor of the incense kitchen; Tao Chi had traveled many roads, and his five internal organs were making noises sitting on the turning wheel chair; the elder invited him to taste the flavor of the incense kitchen, so he honestly and unceremoniously peeled the taro while talking to the elder:</p>
<p>"Layman, riding a fast horse, running back and forth, what are you doing?" "Old monk, in this situation, where can I run? It's really that I look in all directions, but have nowhere to go." "Layman, you speak negatively as soon as you open your mouth, what are you doing?" "Old monk, "I was born at an inauspicious time, and met with heaven's anger;" I'm not being negative." "Layman, you say I was born at an inauspicious time," the old monk asks you, when would you be satisfied with being born?"</p>
<p>"Old monk, the future golden age is far away and uncertain, I don't want to think about it anymore; what I think about is the past era. General public opinion always says this: "China's national power is getting worse and worse with each generation." 20th century China is not as good as 19th century China; 19th century China is not as good as 18th century China. Old monk, if this statement is true, I hate being born too late. If I were born in the peaceful era of the 18th century, spending my limited life praising the wise rule, I would be satisfied: But, "Hundreds of rivers flow east to the sea, when will they return west?" Time is like flowing water, it only flows downstream and absolutely refuses to go back; a prosperous and peaceful China has become a historical relic, what is the situation now? If I'm not negative, then I'm negative.</p>

<p>The Largest Postal Ship in the Pacific Sets Sail The largest postal ship in the Pacific in the past, operating between China and the United States, was the Tenyo Maru, Chiyo Maru, and Shunyo Maru of the Toyo Steamship Company, each with a displacement of 20,000 tons. When they were completed and put into service, they shocked the Far East. The five ministers of the late Qing Dynasty who went abroad to study constitutional government took these ships to the United States. Later, the American Pacific Mail Steamship Company was established, but the ships it operated were only over 10,000 tons. Therefore, Toyo Steamship Company occupied the leading position in the Pacific for a long time. After the European War, the US government's Maritime Commission sold the newly built giant transport ships of the Navy Department. Mr. Dale, the shipping tycoon of the country, purchased them at a huge price. As a result, the "535" fleet of 12 giant ships were added to the Pacific, operating between China and the United States. The so-called 535 fleet means that each ship is 535 feet long and has a load of 21,600 tons. The leading position of the Pacific shipping was then taken by the American company. The British ships operating in the Pacific were only those of the Canadian Changxing Company. The company was affiliated with the Canadian Railway Company and engaged in the business of carrying goods and passengers in the Far East. After Dale bought the giant ships of the American Maritime Commission, Changxing also urgently built a giant ship of 24,000 tons, named the Empress of Canada, and dispatched it to operate in the Pacific. After its completion, it surpassed the US presidential ships and occupied the first place in the Pacific. Two years ago, the Japan Mail Steamship Company, in agreement with the government, believed that Japan had the need to compete for hegemony in the Pacific maritime rights. With the help of the Ministry of Communications, the company first merged the Toyo Company's China-US route into the company, and then purchased its Tenyo Maru, Danyo Maru, and Shunyo Maru. At the same time, it also recruited 30 million yuan of new shares, and the government also contributed 30 million yuan. Three of the largest and fastest new postal ships were built, named Asama Maru, Tatsuta Maru, and Chichibu Maru. When they were completed, the displacement of each ship was more than 26,000 tons, and the speed was 19 miles per hour. The superior arrangement of each ship can be said to be unparalleled in the Pacific, intending to overwhelm the American ships and exclude the British ships. The Changxing Company received the news and also ordered the construction of a new-style postal ship with a displacement of 31,000 tons, a length of 630 feet, and a speed of 21 nautical miles per hour at the Glascow Shipyard in the United Kingdom, named the Empress of Japan. This ship was completed last year and operates between Shanghai and Vancouver, requiring only ten days to cross the Pacific. After the ship was put into operation, it occupied the first place in the Pacific, and the three new ships of Japan, although huge, always felt inferior. The fierce competition among the British, Japanese, and American shipping companies between China and the United States can also be seen. The American businessman Dale, due to the relationship of Pacific shipping rights, and the United States' trade with China being enormous, how could he not compete? Therefore, Dale negotiated with his own government and the government provided huge funds. He immediately started building two of the largest and newest postal ships in New Zealand in his own country. The quoted price was 64 million yuan, and the internal arrangement of the ship was 10 million yuan. It must surpass the ships of both Britain and Japan. With the government's consent, work began immediately. It took two years to complete. One is named President Hoover and the other is named President Coolidge. The length of each ship is 635 feet, and the depth from top to bottom is 81 feet. The entire ship is divided into six zones, and the hull is 33,000 tons. The engine uses a new type of motor, with a total of 60,000 horsepower. The speed per hour is 23 nautical miles. Crossing the Pacific only takes eleven days from east to west if the speed is fully utilized. It is estimated that it only takes eighty-one days to travel around the world, which is much less time than the six months required in the past. At the beginning of the plan, Dale planned to set up an airfield on the ship, similar to the transatlantic express giant ship, with two airplanes attached to pick up and drop off passengers and deliver mail, so that the time could be reduced by four or five days. For example, if passengers from Shanghai to the United States are unable to catch the flight due to some matter, even if the ship has sailed for two or three days, the company can still sell tickets, and then use a plane to transport them to the ship in transit, or if the ship has not yet arrived and the passengers need to arrive at the port first, they can also be sent by plane in advance. Therefore, in addition to establishing a radio station in Shanghai, he also planned to purchase land to set up an airfield. He had consulted with our government on this idea, but the central government did not approve it, so the plane transfer was not realized. The President Hoover, one of the two ships, has already been completed and arrived in Shanghai on the 18th of this month. When it arrived in Shanghai, it invited people from all walks of life to visit the ship. The reporter also went to visit. There are 350 first-class rooms, no separate second class, 150 special-class cabins, and 700 third-class rooms. The arrangement of the first-class rooms can be said to be extremely luxurious. There are single rooms, double rooms, and triple rooms, with private bathrooms and dressing rooms. There are as many as 80 dressing rooms on the entire ship. The beds, chairs, tables, and stools are all specially made, and the carpets and bedding are particularly valuable. All are made of specially made blankets, which are finer, cleaner, and more noble than those of previous ships. The sofas are made of gold-threaded velvet, and some are made of peacock velvet costing dozens of yuan a yard. The height of the reception hall, smoking room, and dining hall and the decoration of the four walls are luxurious and magnificent, surpassing the palace pavilions. There are ancient porcelain, embedded carvings, and ancient Buddha pictures made of strange glass for wall hangings. Even a spittoon and a smoking tray are made of special and delicate items. Each room has a wireless music station, and the library and writing room are especially grand. In addition, there are fully equipped fitness rooms, dance floors, swimming pools, gardens, ball courts, and movie rooms. Each hall also has a department store, and a daily newspaper is issued during the voyage for passengers to read. In addition, wireless communication can be used to communicate with countries around the world. Although on the ship, it is just like living in a giant hotel in a metropolis. The food used is especially exquisite. It is said that for each trip between China and the United States, the ship needs about 30,000 pounds of white sugar, about 4,000 pounds of tea, 5,000 pounds of biscuits, 80,000 pounds of wheat flour, 100,000 pounds of tomatoes, more than 20,000 pounds of vegetables, 6,000 pounds of coffee, 7,000 pounds of syrup, 60,000 pounds of beef, 12,000 pounds of butter, 30,000 pounds of chickens and ducks, 300 boxes of apples, nearly 100,000 eggs, 2,000 jars of soy sauce, more than 40,000 bottles of beer, more than 30,000 bottles of soda, more than 5,000 bottles of other wines, 1 million cigarettes, and more than 3,000 cigars. This is roughly the number. It takes more than 70 days to travel back and forth, and the food for about 1,000 people, the actual number may be more than the detailed number mentioned above. After this first giant ship came to Shanghai, it caused a sensation. The first flight will depart on October 2nd, heading directly from Shanghai to New York, stopping at Honolulu, San Francisco, Cuba, etc. in Japan. It is estimated to arrive in 36 days, which is 36 hours earlier than the fastest ship currently traveling between China and the United States. If it is released directly from Shanghai without stopping along the way, and the speed is fully utilized, it can arrive in more than 20 days. The President Coolidge of the same type is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai and operate in December. After its operation, it has become the largest and fastest postal ship in the Pacific, and the new ship of the Japan Mail Steamship Company and the Queen ship of Changxing have been reduced to second and third place. This is the current situation of the large ships in the Far East.</p>

<h3 id="e157">From Gandhi to China <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Fei</p>
<p>Surrounded by mountains and sea, fertile fields everywhere, on the land where the Ganges River lies, its people, before the fifteenth century, lived and taught, spending their days loving and hunting, enjoying the uniquely endowed happiness year after year, which gave rise to all cultures based on the heart. It is not surprising that Sakyamuni was born in response to the times. After the seventeenth century, this beautiful land suddenly became a piece of fat, constantly suffering the tragic torture of being cut and slaughtered. From then on, 300 million people gradually fell to the bottom of the abyss, with their hearts enslaved by form and their spirits enslaved by .</p>
<p>This, coupled with the naturally molded, gentle-hearted, and Buddha-minded red-headed Asans, everything that has been molded by the melting of charming scenery and the cultural education and high moral character of thousands of years, encountering the colorless race with strong soldiers and sharp armor, killing and robbing, naturally they were defeated at the sight of the wind, and surrendered to be killed.</p>
<p>However, the descendants of the Buddha, who have been submerged and trampled under the iron hooves of the British Empire for hundreds of years, have also been shouting for autonomy and independence in recent decades, following in the footsteps of these younger generations, because they do not compete for survival, leading to the decline of the country. The great saint Gandhi, in the midst of the people's tears and cries to heaven, walked out of the world .</p>
<p>"Return to the spinning wheel," Gandhi led 300 million compatriots to move towards the situation 200 years ago, with a hand-cranked spinning wheel in every household, and many city residents moving to the countryside to live. People of all classes wear native-made zkhadd (hand-woven coarse cloth). Many proletarians in Europe want to rise to the position of the bourgeoisie and pursue material enjoyment, while in India, the upper class and middle class are willing to retreat and live a simple, poor life. Most of the excellent intellectual class sacrifice their own private interests to engage in civil movements. They have no food other than clean water and coarse bread, and no home other than prison.</p>
<p>Gandhi has been moving like this, is still moving like this, and will continue to move like this in the future, until India is independent.</p>
<p>Liang Shuming said that Europe and the United States is a philosophy of advancement, India is a philosophy of retreat, and China is a philosophy that is neither advancing nor retreating (the general meaning is like this, the words are no longer remembered). I think this is also true. Today, we are praising scientific culture, and tomorrow, we are advocating a quiet life. On the surface, we are seeking material enjoyment, while at the same time, we are calculating the comfort of the soul in spirit. Moderation, harmony, and compromise are all commonly heard and seen examples. China's superlative and perfect nouns and the standards of everything stand at the crossroads, lingering and wandering. Thus, China's semi-colonial state has become a spectacle in the world.</p>
<p>I say that Europe and the United States is a philosophy of blood, India is a philosophy of tears, and China is a philosophy of pus. We should not only know how to shed tears, but hurry to wash away the abscesses on our bodies, and strive to splash the red-hot blood.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Wake Up, Compatriots <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Guanhua</p>
<p>Wake up, compatriots, now is not the time for sweet sleep. Look at the angry waves spewing out from the dim and gray atmosphere. The wind is dancing, the rain is dancing, the lightning is dancing, the thunder is dancing, iron is screaming, steel is screaming, knives are screaming, swords are screaming, guns are screaming, bullets are screaming. Now is not the time to cry. Let decay and death remain in old dreams, let sorrow and death remain in old dreams, let, ah, let all declining will die. Compatriots, wake up, kick away the heart of the weak, kick away the brain of the weak. Look, look, look, look at the blood of our compatriots spurting out, look at the flesh of our compatriots being cut open, look at the corpses of our compatriots being hung up.</p>
<p>The hot blood of our compatriots is erupting like a volcano, the will of our compatriots, collapsing like a volcano, and then flying up again.</p>
<p>Look,</p>
<p>The forward, bright will of resistance is immortal. Look,</p>
<p>The bright, forward, resisting will is eternal. Look, ah,</p>
<p>The hot blood of our compatriots is erupting like a volcano, erupting, erupting, erupting. Propaganda: A train spitting steam speeds towards Kunshan. Eighteen of the carriages are our propaganda team. People are holding small flags, slogans, and leaflets. The masses are noisily discussing the invasion of the Northeast by the brutal Japanese.</p>
<p>"It's better to rely on ourselves than to ask others. The League of Nations ordered China and Japan to withdraw their troops. Heh, what is this? Where are we telling China to retreat to? What's the use of asking the League of Nations? There's no other way than to actively do it ourselves."</p>
<p>"Fight them fair and square."</p>
<p>In a corner of the carriage sat an old man. He looked in astonishment at the two students arguing. "What are they doing?" he asked a woman beside him, probably his wife.</p>
<p>"Don't ask too much..." The woman then brought her mouth close to the old man's ear and whispered, "Young people just want to become officials."</p>
<p>The old man nodded. He seemed a little afraid of his wife. After a pause, they talked smugly about their son's future. "He's a promising child. Heaven bless him to get an official position and glorify our ancestors. Then we..." The old man's mouth was already grinning from ear to ear as he said this. Soon the train arrived in Kunshan. The atmosphere in the streets was surprisingly calm. The people were just curiously looking at us. We gathered a few people and started giving speeches.</p>
<p>Pedestrians occasionally walked over, but many also retreated. Many people ran over, turned around and left. An old gentleman ran in, read the words on the propaganda team's flag, and ran back out. ○　　○　　○　　○　　○</p>
<p>Soon the propaganda team gave a speech in a small school. After the bell rang, the students timidly came out and lined up. The speech began.</p>
<p>Children, you must know that the Japanese are our eternal enemies. They are violently killing, setting fires, and looting in our country... They have taken our Northeast by force. They even want to further destroy our country. Children, this is so terrible. If you don't study hard and don't listen to your teacher, then our China will be destroyed. If our country is destroyed, we will be bullied everywhere like the people of India and Annam. You will have to lie on the road and be horses for the Japanese to ride... After speaking for a long time, the children scratched their heads and asked the classmates beside them. As a result, everyone looked at each other in astonishment and often looked timidly at their teacher. The speech ended there.</p>
<p>Dongzi exhaled and returned to Shanghai in the dim twilight.</p>
<p>○　　○　　○</p>
<p>Young people, actively go to the people to do propaganda work.</p>
