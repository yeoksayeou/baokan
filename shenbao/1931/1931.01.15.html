(14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing - The Central Political Conference previously received a submission from Li Zhenduo requesting that Weihaiwei port be temporarily designated as a free commercial port. This was referred to the Economic Group for review. The result was that, given Weihaiwei's recent recovery and special circumstances, all local tax revenues should primarily consider not hindering the local economy. Administrative expenses should also be minimized. The necessary amount, beyond local revenue, should be subsidized by the national treasury as much as possible. The detailed measures should be planned and decided by the Executive Yuan. It is reported that the Central Political Conference on the 14th resolved to approve this review report. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Hosting Banquet for Belgian Representatives Today</p>
<p>Belgian Envoy Arrives in Tianjin and Suddenly Faints</p>
<p>Tianjin - Wang Zhengting, accompanied by his wife, as well as Diao Minqian and his wife, Xu Mo, Wang Cisheng, Ying Shangde, and others, arrived in Tianjin at 7:00 AM on the 14th. Wang Shuchang, Zang Qifang, Zhang Xueming, Wang Shuhan, Huang Zongfa, and Tan Fu welcomed him. Wang and his party stayed at the Yuzhong Hotel. At noon, they went to the residence of Gao in Special District One, where they were hosted at a banquet by Zang Min. At 2:00 PM, they visited Zhang Xueliang but did not meet him. At 3:00 PM, they went to Nankai University to give a speech. At 5:00 PM, they returned to their residence. It is scheduled that they will exchange documents at the municipal government at 10:00 AM on the 15th, and a handover ceremony will be held at the Belgian Concession Engineering Bureau at 11:00 AM. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, Wang will give a speech at the celebration meeting held by representatives from all walks of life at the municipal party headquarters. At 8:00 PM on the 15th, Wang will host a banquet for Belgian envoys and consuls, during which he will also give a speech. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin - At 8:00 PM on the 14th, Wang Shuchang hosted a banquet at the provincial government club to welcome Wang. According to Wang, he came specifically to take over the Belgian Concession and to inspect other concessions and the diplomatic situation in North China. He will stay for two or three days and then go to Beiping for a visit. Whether he will exchange views with the envoys on the recovery of legal rights in Beiping depends on the opportunity, as there is no prior appointment. After Beiping, he plans to visit Weihaiwei without delay and then return to Nanjing. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin - Belgian Envoy Warlus and Counselor Jalid arrived in Tianjin on the evening of the 13th and stayed at the Astor House Hotel. Warlus suddenly fainted and lost consciousness. After a German doctor administered two injections, he recovered. He remained in bed on the 14th and did not get up. It was originally scheduled that Wang and Hua would exchange documents on the 15th. If Hua is unable to get up, the exchange of documents will be carried out by Zang Qifang, the receiver commissioner, and Wang Desen, the Belgian consul. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin - Wang Zhengting stated in his speech at Nankai University that he has great hope for the students, who are students today and will be the masters of the country in the future. They will be able to exercise the five powers. During their student days, they should have proper training. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will urged the alliance with nations that treat China equally to strive together. We demand that China becomes an independent country, not only by relying on our own collective efforts to become strong, but also by uniting with nations that treat China equally to strive together. Dr. Sun also said that a national assembly should be convened soon to abolish unequal treaties. There are two types of unequal treaties: first, tariff rights are in the hands of foreigners, and now, thanks to the spirit of Dr. Sun in heaven, tariff autonomy has been achieved. Second, the abolition of consular jurisdiction. Several countries have already abolished it. Germany and Austria abolished it due to internal unrest, and Mexico is currently negotiating its abolition. Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Spain, Denmark, and other countries are also in negotiations. The National Assembly is scheduled to open on May 5th. We hope that the abolition of consular jurisdiction will also be achieved on the same day. This is not to intimidate foreigners, but it is the determination of the Chinese people to seek independence. Looking at the more than 50 countries in the world, only China has consular jurisdiction. What injustice could be greater than this? Now, the right to inland waterway navigation has been abolished, and efforts are being made to abolish consular jurisdiction. Everyone must recognize that they are citizens and not give up their duty as citizens. What is even more hoped for from everyone is: first, to strengthen the body and wash away the shame of being the "sick man of East Asia"; second, to study and make great achievements in society; third, to study politics, but not to interfere in politics. So-called, if the people's hearts are not dead, the country will not perish. I hope everyone will work hard, and then the country will be strong and the people will enjoy happiness. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin - After the ceremony for the reception of the Belgian Concession is completed on the 15th, Zang Qifang will host a banquet for Chinese and Belgian representatives at Gao Jiyi's residence. At 8:00 PM, Wang Zhengting will host a banquet for Chinese and Belgian representatives at the Xihu Hotel, inviting celebrities to accompany them. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin - Diao Minqian, Director of Intelligence, stated that Wang's visit to Tianjin is solely for the purpose of receiving the Belgian Concession and does not have any other tasks. It is completely inaccurate that Wang is going to Beiping to negotiate the recovery of legal rights and the relocation of the embassies to the south. The recovery of legal rights should be negotiated in the capital. As for the issue of relocating the embassies to the south, there is no need to urge them. They will naturally move south because the capital is in Nanjing. It is inconvenient for embassies to be in Beiping and not in Nanjing. The French envoy has already rented private residences in Nanjing and will be the first to move south. The National Government has designated land for the embassies and is planning to build them, but it is feared that they will not be able to move south for another year. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - Wang Zhengting is scheduled to come to Beiping on the 16th and will meet with the envoys in a private capacity. He will return to Nanjing in about two or three days. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing - According to diplomatic circles, the Weihaiwei Chamber of Commerce, upon learning that Minister Wang was going north to participate in the Tianjin Belgian Concession handover ceremony, sent a special telegram to Minister Wang on the 13th, welcoming him to Weihai. However, it is still unknown whether he will be able to visit Weihai. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<p>All Army Commanders Remain in Taiyuan Awaiting Instructions</p>
<p>Beiping - Regarding the disbandment of the former 2nd, 3rd, and Combined Armies, the troops initially hoped for more personnel so that more teams could be formed, and even recruited soldiers locally to replenish the numbers. However, after the leaders met with Zhang in Tianjin, they learned that the central government's disbandment policy was based on the amount of reduction as an assessment. Shang Zhen and Xu Yongchang did not have many troops, so they said that disbandment was not difficult. They hoped that the Northwest Army and Sun Dianying and Gao Guizi, who had entered Shanxi, could be transferred to Shaanxi and be disbanded by Yang Hucheng in Xi'an. If this is done, the funds borrowed by Shanxi and Suiyuan can be used to barely manage the post-war affairs of Shanxi and Suiyuan. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - Wang Ying telegraphed to persuade the Suiyuan Shanxi Army, saying that the expansion of the Shanxi-Suiyuan Army was handled by Yan's orders, not approved by the central government. Now that Yan has failed, Yan's troops should listen to the orders of Chiang and Zhang and carry out the downsizing earnestly to see the future effect. However, the troops still maintain their own protection and are stationed in the Suiyuan area with 60,000 people. On the one hand, they demand funds for reorganization, and on the other hand, they impose harsh levies on the people to provide supplies. They do not suppress the bandits. Ying has no choice but to organize a militia to defend themselves and support Chiang and Zhang to the end. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Taiyuan - Military and political authorities are actively negotiating the post-war affairs of the Shanxi army and administration.

(14th Dispatch) All the Shanxi army commanders mostly remained in Taiyuan awaiting the decision on the post-war settlement of Shanxi and Suiyuan from Tianjin.

They have sent personnel to Nanjing and Tianjin to present this view. The Shanxi army will be reduced to four armies. Because the old system of the Shanxi army is different from that of the Northeast, it may still need to be considered before proceeding. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Taiyuan - Kong Xiangxi sent Yan Jingzhai back to Taiyuan to declare to all parties the reasons why he could not return to Shanxi and ordered him to assist in the post-war settlement.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary: The European Crisis</p>
<p>In recent months, the idea that Europe will relapse into war has become very popular. One reason is the difficulty in the economic world; some people think war can temporarily remedy this. Another reason is that Germany's commerce is declining, unemployment is increasing, and the Young Plan is unable to cope. Because of this, there is obvious incompatibility between France and Italy. Therefore, the issue of arms reduction and the issue of changing the European war treaties reveal their unease from time to time, and thus there is talk that war can happen at any time.</p>
<p>Recently, British aristocrat Lord Cecil said that 1931 will be a most difficult year, and before the end of the year, the issue of disarmament may become acute. He also said that the issue of the treatment of ethnic minorities in Europe will soon become an international issue. If a conflict occurs between Germany and Poland regarding the treatment of Germans in Upper Silesia, it could ignite all of Europe, and the power of the League of Nations will also be destroyed. His words are also related to the European treaty. Although not explicitly helping Germany, his sentiment and Italy's opposition to Germany mutually illuminate each other.</p>
<p>In short, the reason for the talk of the resurgence of the European war is all due to economic difficulties and the inability to fulfill the European war treaties, so everyone lives in anxiety and overestimates.</p>

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams: Is the Future of Europe Really Dangerous?</p>
<p>Arms Reduction and the Problem of Ethnic Minorities</p>
<p>Both are Likely to Become Leading Causes of Major Turmoil in Europe</p>
<p>|London Newspaper’s Words of Warning|</p>
<p>London News: The British Labour Party organ, the Daily Herald, in its editorial, based on the New Year's speeches of German Finance Minister Gruner and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, stated that Europe is now heading for the most dangerous situation since the Great War. Wan Luna, representing the German cabinet, delivered a New Year's greeting to President Hindenburg, strongly arguing that Germany could not bear the burden imposed by the Young Plan and advocating that Germany should receive the same treatment as other countries on the issue of armaments. Mussolini published an interview in a certain newspaper, expressing his support for Germany on the issue of armaments and advocating for the revision of various peace treaties. The Daily Herald stated that since the attitudes of Germany and Italy are like this, and France's stubborn opposition is equally clear, it is fortunate that the British Foreign Office is in the hands of Henderson at this critical juncture in Europe.</p>
<p>Another report: The Sunday Times, in its first issue of the New Year, claimed that Europe in 1930 will be a turning point in its history. The newspaper does not see any light in the recent future of peace and security, and says, "Economic stagnation everywhere leads to domestic reaction, and the result will inevitably be more riots than peace." It also said that no one needs war, and it is now appropriate to arouse public opinion in the next few months so that when the disarmament conference is convened, its voice can be clearly heard.</p>
<p>Another report: The Daily Mail published a prominent excerpt of Lord Cecil's talk, which included "I think 1931 will be an extremely difficult year" and "I fear that before the end of the year, the issue of disarmament will become acute." The newspaper criticized it, saying that Lord Cecil's warning will unfortunately prove to be true, and that the issue of the treatment of ethnic minorities in Europe will soon become an international issue. Regarding the treatment of Germans in Upper Silesia, if a conflict occurs between Germany and Poland, it will set all of Europe ablaze, and the power of the League of Nations will collapse and be unable to recover.

<p>New Indian Constitution</p>
<p>Muslims Concerned About Guarantee of Interests</p>
<p>Elect Representatives to Petition the British Prime Minister</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th: Muslims are now expressing anxiety about whether the new Indian constitution currently under consideration by the Indian Round Table Conference will guarantee the special interests of Muslims. Last night, Muslim representatives met for a long time and decided to elect three people to meet with British Prime Minister MacDonald today to state the demands of Muslims. If a satisfactory statement is not obtained regarding this petition, the Muslim representatives must adopt a dissenting attitude at the next plenary session. At today's meeting of the Federal Structure Committee, Lord Reading stated that the representatives of the Liberal Party have not seen any reason to change the views he expressed on January 6. The views and conditions of the Liberal Party are based on two assumptions: one is the resolution of the Hindu-Muslim issue, and the other is the establishment and implementation of the federal constitution. Chairman Sankey has drafted three clauses to accommodate the views of all parties, which are included in the report. The clauses state that the methods agreed upon by the majority of the committee on important matters are only temporary in nature, and any representative reserves the right to change their opinion before the final text is completed.</p>
<p>German Financial Situation</p>
<p>Revenue and Expenditure Differ by One Billion Marks</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 14th: German Finance Minister Dr. Dietrich, speaking at today's meeting of the parliamentary budget committee, strongly argued for the dangerous situation of the German federal finances, saying that Germany's tax revenue has sharply reduced to 700,000,000 marks, while at the same time, expenditures exceed the budget by more than 300,000,000 marks. The total shortfall, including deficits and overdrafts, amounts to 1,000,000,000 marks. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has issued debt notes of approximately 800,000,000 marks to aid unemployment. All indirect and direct taxes have already reached their peak and cannot be further increased. Even the salaries of government officials have been reduced to the minimum and are difficult to further reduce. According to reports, after the number of unemployed in Germany reached 4.5 million, people were extremely anxious and worried that Germany's financial situation would become unsustainable. Coupled with Dr. Dietrich's argument this afternoon, it is very doubtful whether the German government can balance its revenue and expenditure.</p>

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams Two: Shidehara Disregards Party Politics</p>
<p>Only Provides the Seiyukai with an Excuse to Attack</p>
<p>Hamaguchi Can Now See Guests Freely</p>
<p>The Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The Seiyukai held a meeting of its executives at party headquarters yesterday afternoon. After Secretary-General Tamamori reported on recent political developments, Shimada, the Director-General, gave a speech on the issue of Prime Minister Shidehara's agency, saying, "It is not only a major problem in constitutional politics for Shidehara, a non-party member, to act as Prime Minister and attend the Diet. It is also questionable whether Mr. Shidehara is qualified to be a minister in a party cabinet. Why do I say this? When he met with reporters after Prime Minister Hamaguchi's incident, the reporters asked if he would join the party when he took over as Prime Minister, and he said, 'I would not fall so low as to join a political party.' This is a great insult to political parties. Also, after meeting with Prime Minister Hamaguchi on the 11th, he told reporters, 'The so-called political parties are nothing more than that. It is enough to fulfill five out of a hundred promises to the people. If you fulfill every word, political parties will have nothing to do.' How insulting is this to political parties? It is as if he himself has stated that he has no understanding of party politics. Naturally, we cannot recognize such a person as the Prime Minister of a party cabinet, and it is difficult to recognize him even as a minister. In short, Shidehara's acting as Prime Minister of the Minseito cabinet and attending the Diet is a fundamental problem of party cabinets and must be carefully considered." He insisted on the necessity of impeaching Shidehara from beginning to end. The Seiyukai executives all agreed and then discussed specific methods, adjourning at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>The Japan Union News Agency reported that from the 14th onwards, Prime Minister Hamaguchi will be allowed to see guests freely, so those visiting him are extremely crowded.</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>The Jingdezhen Huizhou Merchant Bandit Disaster Refugee Relief Committee telegraphed the Shen Bao Newspaper, forwarding to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Party Headquarters of various provinces, the governments of various provinces, various newspapers, various public organizations, and all charitable organizations and Huizhou natives residing in other ports, elders, brothers, sisters, and aunts. It is with deep sorrow that Jingdezhen has suffered banditry, once is bad enough, let alone three times. The cries of gods and ghosts, the heavens and earth are dark. Jingdezhen is one of the four famous towns in China, specializing in porcelain products, famous all over the world. Industry and commerce are concentrated, and trade is developed. But the bandits and communists, who are conscienceless and mad, occupy and ravage, cruel and inhumane, plunder and must satisfy their desires, and slaughter all the good people. The first time was on July 6 at 9:00 AM, when they arrived in the town and organized a labor union as their pawns, burning, looting, and committing adultery. Local losses were no less than several million yuan. After harassing for four days, they retreated. The second time was on September 8, when they arrived in the town. The red flames were high, even worse than before. The demands for money were like sparks, and killing people was like killing ants. They left after fourteen days, extorting several million yuan, and also took away more than twenty people, including former presidents of the Chamber of Commerce, Chen Zhongxi and Zhang Qidong, as well as dozens of interior ticket holders. The third time they arrived in town on October 2, destroying everything without leaving any effort, causing even greater harm than before. Knowing that the current cash in the market is exhausted, they took away all the goods from the shops, leaving ten out of ten houses empty, as if washed by water. Moreover, they arrested people from the business community, used severe torture, and extracted everything without leaving anything behind, so that shop owners and shop assistants were exposed to the wind and ate in the open, all of whom were guests along the door, and hunger and cold were intertwined, becoming victims of the ditch. The bandits had been in this battle for as long as fifty days. People in Jingdezhen have suffered more than 5,000 casualties as a result, and the direct and indirect losses of property are more than tens of millions of yuan, making it exist in name only. However, the six counties of Huizhou are close to Jingdezhen, and the number of merchants who come here to do business is extremely large. Therefore, the majority of the losses this time are indeed Huizhou people. Now, there are more than 10,000 people who are scattered in all directions and have no place to rely on, and tens of thousands of people who are unemployed and have no way to make a living. The wounds are huge and the pain is deep. How can we do a good job of post-disaster relief? Now, fellow villagers in Jingdezhen have organized the Jingdezhen Huizhou Merchants Bandit Disaster Refugee Relief Committee (located at the New Anhui Academy) to handle relief matters. We humbly ask all benevolent people and virtuous people, to embrace each other, to hold each other in their arms, to widely solicit donations, and to urgently plan for relief. In addition to widely soliciting donations to save the fellow villagers who have been victimized, we also hope that the government will be called on to provide relief as soon as possible, so that the refugees can celebrate their rebirth and the business can be gradually restored. This is to cry and tell, do not allow extreme gratitude, Jingdezhen Huizhou Merchants Bandit Disaster Refugee Relief Committee kowtows and sighs.</p>
<p>A Telegram from Jinning to the Newspaper Honored Acknowledgment: We received General Commander Jiang Qingwei's telegram stating that Sun Lianzhong was appointed as the commander of the 25th Division, etc. Based on this, we respectfully and prudently took office on the day of the Lunar New Year in Jinning Fangci, swearing an oath of office. I am afraid that I will not be able to bear this heavy responsibility with my humble talent. However, I hope that the virtuous people in the world and the advanced people of the party and the country will not hesitate to teach and give advice from time to time, so that I will have something to rely on and avoid the ridicule of falling. This is what I hope and pray for. Sincerely yours, Sun Lianzhong, Commander of the 25th Division of the Army.</p>

<p>The Chinese coast has reached customs standards. In the future, naval and merchant ships will be gradually constructed. We will certainly use many talented people. I sincerely hope that all foreign comrades will come and study here continuously. Then, recovering the pilotage rights and strengthening national defense will be extremely easy. I am willing to work hard with you all.</p>
<p>Director Yu's words of thanks at the certificate award ceremony held at the institute: I am deeply grateful that the Ministry of the Navy attached great importance and sent representatives to give instructions. We have respectfully listened to the instructions of the representative of the Ministry of the Navy, the speeches of the examiners, and the instructions of the chairman. Among the pilots, the majority are academically excellent and have rich experience, but there are also some with insufficient experience. After this study, do not think that your knowledge is sufficient, and you must work hard to improve. Those with insufficient knowledge and experience should study and learn, and those with excellent knowledge and experience should also seek further progress in preparation for the pilot examination of the Examination Yuan to obtain a formal business license, so that the pilotage business can be fully guaranteed. Furthermore, after you pilots receive your certificates today, I sincerely hope that you will still come to the institute often and report to the institute in detail on the special circumstances of the shipping industry and the experience gained. If the institute has new knowledge, it will also guide you. The Yangtze River channel changes from time to time, and the pilotage methods are also constantly evolving. It is essential to study it regularly. The new waterway charts of each port published by the Hydrographic Office are very clear and can be used as a reference. Therefore, I sincerely hope that you will often come to the institute when you are in Shanghai. This will not only increase your knowledge and advice but also benefit your future. You previously had the Three Gangs and Five Public Associations, but the organization was poor and the content was scattered. I sincerely hope that the students who have obtained certificates in this training will quickly form a well-organized and orderly Yangtze River Pilot Training Institute Alumni Association to form a group to exchange knowledge and research academic topics. This will not only unify authority but also strengthen relationships. The institute can directly inform the association of matters related to pilotage, which is especially convenient. I sincerely hope that everyone will work together to achieve this goal as soon as possible. The director of this institute has high hopes.</p>
<p>All Jiangsu shipping industry yesterday meeting</p>
<p>Building send river management expense question</p>
<p>Still must continue to meet today</p>
<p>The Jiangsu provincial government construction office wanted to dredge the port's inner river channel last year and planned to raise funds to save river donations. The shipping industry in various places sent letters and protested against the case. Now the construction authorities have brought up the previous proposal again. The provincial shipping industry gathered at the Shanghai Shipping Association yesterday to discuss solutions. Shanghai Shipping Association members Ding Xijun, Zheng Tang (Sheng Shanzhi acting), Director Chen Bogang, Shanghai Municipal Inland River Ship Industry Association representatives Qiao Shide Zhang Fengshou, Wuxi Qian Qing, Zhang , Shen Xijun, Zhenjiang Tao Shoubai, Liangjing Li Yingnan, Wujin Yang Zhongxiu, Xuzhou Zhu Yi, Nantong Tang Shouqing, and Construction Department member Yu Mingzhong, etc., more than ten people publicly elected Tao Shoubai, the representative of the Zhenjiang Shipping Association, as chairman. Yang Bailong recorded the ceremony as follows. The chairman immediately stood up and announced the opinion letters submitted by each association. Then, each representative expressed deep opinions. Construction Department member Yu asked the shipping industry to accommodate the department's collection methods. The discussion did not end until 5:30 p.m. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met with a representative of the Construction Department at the Shipping Association. According to the representative, the number of river management expenses collected by the Construction Department was 5%, while the shipping companies only allowed 1%. It is said that, currently, the shipping industry is in a severe downturn and cannot bear external burdens. In order to preserve the government's credibility, they have to slightly obey the department's orders. The general meeting has already decided on a solution, and a formal passage is still pending decision at today's (15th) meeting. Also, Mr. Qiao Shide, the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Inland River Ship Industry Association, hosted a banquet to entertain representatives from various places after the meeting to strengthen ties.</p>
<p>The postal company changed to using Japanese yen</p>
<p>Prices rose by seventy percent</p>
<p>Implemented on February 15</p>
<p>Recently, the price of gold has soared. The local Nippon Yusen Kaisha has always calculated the water freight for goods exported from Shanghai to Japan in Shanghai silver dollars. Now, it has been specially decided to switch to collecting in Japanese yen, using the pretext of the high price of gold to suddenly increase export freight rates. According to the original price list, it needs to be increased by about 70%. Yesterday, the company decided to switch to using the Japanese yen standard starting from February 15. It has notified various Hakka and Chinese merchants. The Chinese merchants believe that the increased freight rate is too high and deviates from the norm. However, there are no Chinese ships operating on the China-Japan route, so they can only be subject to its oppression.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Sichuan people ask for a state funeral for Lu Shidi <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Translation team old example</p>
<p>Permission to be buried in Zijin Mountain</p>
<p>Since General Lu Qing passed away from illness, the Kuomintang members in Sichuan have felt extremely regretful. In addition to Chengdu and other places, they are already preparing grand memorial services to express their condolences. The Sichuan Provincial Committee Xiang Chuanyi, Song Shaozeng, and dozens of key figures of the Sichuan Kuomintang, such as Dong Chonglin, jointly telegraphed the central government, requesting that it follow the example of comrade Yizu'an and allow a state funeral in Zijin Mountain. The original telegram said: Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Chairman Jiang, and the heads of the Five Yuan: Recently, we received news from Shanghai that comrade Lu Shidi passed away from illness. Your meeting must have a grand ceremony to honor his party merits, comfort the deceased, and encourage those who come after. We especially recommend that your meeting and government consider that we have shared hardships with Shidi for a long time and know him best. We must present this to your meeting and government. We believe that Shidi has been fighting for 20 years since he joined the party, with loyalty, courage, purity, and sincerity. Therefore, every time he led the Yixian battle, Shidi was able to unite his comrades and face the enemy with a single mind, forgetting life and death. (The telegram code is suspected of being wrong) He was able to make great contributions repeatedly, illuminating the party history. In our department, there were the Xinhai Revolution, the National Protection War, and the Constitution Protection War, all of which were biased, participating in the war. He was known to the Premier since the failure of Guichou. He was appointed as the commander of the Sichuan Revolutionary Army. At that time, all comrades in Sichuan were under his leadership, overcoming obstacles and difficulties, and never giving up. He followed the Premier to Guangdong and repeatedly made extraordinary plans. He worked diligently, especially in the battle to deceive Chen, uniting the Yunnan and Guizhou armies and laying the foundation for the Guangdong situation. The Premier praised him and gave him the order of the Third Army. Later, Chen and the Premier went north to plan military affairs, and he entrusted him with everything. As far as the internal Yin Northern Expedition, Commander-in-Chief Jiang cared about the western frontier and disobeyed Shidi's orders to go to Sichuan to spread virtue. The armies responded enthusiastically. In recent years, the party and the country have been in turmoil, and the left and right have been divided. Shidi supported the central government, reconciled party disputes, and his will was to worry about the country and forget himself, with lonely and painstaking efforts, which is even more commendable and weeping. Tracing his past achievements, he was indeed a strange man in the bitter party. For two years, he was depressed at sea, and his illness was incurable. He was alone and had no possessions. His situation was even more tragic. Now that unification has been achieved, Shidi suddenly died. He was a martyr and contributed to the party and the country. We hope that your meeting and government will issue a clear order and follow the example of comrade Tan Zu'an and give him a state funeral in Zijin Mountain, so that Shidi can personally inherit the Premier's voice and demeanor in life, and he can also be immortal after death. His life's work should be passed on to the party history to show his loyalty. In this way, not only will the comrades in Sichuan be excited when they hear about it, but also the scholars at home and abroad will be happy to support the central government. With this special honor, who would not be encouraged and happy to consolidate the foundation of the party and the country forever? Chuanyi and others are saddened by the death of the deceased and think about the future, forgetting their presumptuous and inappropriate criticisms, and making this move to honor their dead friend. Tears are falling in the wind, and they are extremely frightened. Xiang Chuanyi and others kowtow together.</p>
<p>Appeal judgment on insurance compensation case after Xinjie hit a reef</p>
<p>Foreign merchants should be ordered to compensate the full amount</p>
<p>The steamer Xinjie of the China Merchants Bureau hit a reef and sank the year before last. The goods transported by the Fuzhou gang reached about 50 million yuan. The gang had insured more than 300,000 yuan of insurance with foreign merchants such as the Berlin Homburg Water and Land Transportation Insurance Company and the Shanghai Baoxing Fire and Water Insurance Company. After the Xinjie accident, the Fuzhou gang requested compensation, but the foreign insurance companies refused to pay for various reasons. The Fuzhou gang filed a lawsuit, and the Provisional Court issued a second judgment on March 20 last year, ordering the defendants to compensate the full amount. The defendants refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. The case was summoned for hearing, and the Dizizi No. 201 judgment was received the day before yesterday. In the case of the dispute between the two parties due to compensation, the appellant refused to accept the first-instance judgment of the Shanghai Concession Provisional Court of the Republic of China on March 20, 1919, and filed an appeal. The court ruled that the appeal was dismissed, and the second-instance litigation costs were borne by the appellant. The reasons for the judgment are as follows: The respondent insured the cargo loaded on the steamer Xinjie of the China Merchants Bureau with the appellant for water insurance. The appellant issued separate insurance policies to be held by them. The steamer Xinjie departed from Shanghai to Fujian on November 6, 1917. At about 3 p.m. on the 8th of the month, it arrived near Caoshi Island, more than 100 miles north of Fuzhou (inside Caoshi Island) and was injured by a reef. The seawater poured into the front cabin very quickly. In order to prevent the ship from sinking into the sea, the captain drove the ship to Daishan Island, three miles away from Caoshi Island, to take refuge. In addition to throwing two parts of the cargo into the sea to reduce the weight of the ship and two parts being taken by fishermen taking the opportunity, the rest were burned. At that time, the goods insured by the respondent, except for the 15 pieces of Xinfu sent by the post office, were not loaded on the Xinjie steamer. They were all loaded on the ship when the Xinwan steamer encountered danger. The respondent has submitted the bill of lading issued by the China Merchants Bureau and the receipt issued by the steamer Xinjie of the China Merchants Bureau, as well as the parcel receipt from the post office, together with the certificate that they were loaded on the Xinjie steamer. It has also been proved by the staff of the China Merchants Bureau that it is true. Although the appellant attacked the date on the bill of lading, which had been changed, and the location of the fog on the seal on the bill of lading, the date was occasionally wrong and then corrected. It is difficult to use this as an excuse. Even if the China Merchants Bureau and the respondent colluded to do something, the seal was originally to prove that the cargo was securely loaded on the ship when it encountered danger in Xinwan. The location of the fog was also a general reference to the vicinity of Daishan Island. Daishan Island is only three miles away from Caoshi Island, and both places were foggy at that time. There are sea disaster certificates from the Shanghai Maritime Customs and testimonies from passenger Ding Xiancheng and the first mate of the Xinjie, Ge Luwenke, in the first instance. The appellant has obliterated the word "vicinity" and accused the seal of being false, which is a misunderstanding. In addition to the bill of lading, there is also a receipt from the steamer Xinjie of the China Merchants Bureau to prove it. The appellant has no dispute over the receipt and cannot attack the bill of lading as false with empty words. Other cabin manifests and other documents need to be investigated again. Also, the cargo loaded on the steamer Xinjie has been completely destroyed after hitting the reef, which has been undisputed by the appellant. The respondent's cargo was indeed on the ship when it hit the reef, as mentioned above. The appellant should be liable for the loss caused by the reef. It has also been clearly recognized. Regardless of the English on the insurance policy, regarding the exclusion of pirates, the appellant has failed to prove that the respondent was clearly aware of it before or at the time of signing the contract. Based on the principle that the contract should be based on the agreement of the parties' intentions, it has no binding effect on the respondent. Even if the danger of pirates has been excluded, the fishermen who took the cargo during the interval are different from the behavior of pirates. The steamer Xinjie avoided to Daishan Island due to hitting the reef, causing part of the cargo to be taken by the fishermen. It is completely different from the looting of pirates. If the steamer Xinjie did not hit the reef, it would not have sailed to Daishan Island, and the cargo on board would not have been taken by the fishermen and destroyed by fire. Therefore, the fishermen took the cargo and it was destroyed by fire purely due to the reef. The causal relationship is direct. The loss suffered by the respondent is naturally the responsibility of the appellant for compensation. How can the appellant falsely accuse it of being a pirate act and unrelated to the reef, hoping to be exempt from liability? As for the appellant's claim that British laws and customs should be recited, it is only based on the insurance policy printed by the appellant's company. The English side of the insurance policy signed by the two parties only contains insurance matters. It should be based on the conditions contained in the insurance policy printed by the company. If the printed insurance policy records anything, it is not recorded in the formal insurance policy signed by the two parties, and it cannot force the respondent to know what he does not know. How can it be used as a basis? In short, the loss suffered by the respondent was caused by the danger guaranteed by the appellant. Therefore, regardless of which country's laws or customs are applied, the appellant has no room to shirk responsibility. The amount of compensation that the appellant should pay has been sufficiently proven by the insurance policy invoices and other documents submitted by the respondent. The appellant has no dispute over this. The original judgment to pay the amount is not inconsistent. The appeal has no reason. Based on the above arguments, the appeal is unreasonable.

<p>Rice industry discusses methods to prevent water adulteration</p>
<p>Ship owners will be severely punished by the authorities</p>
<p>Rice merchants will reclaim the goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai rice market sells about 10,000 stones of rice every day, which is transported from various producing areas in the north and south of Jiaxing. In recent years, the price of rice has been high, and the ship owners who transport rice from the south have often adulterated it with water. The Southern Rice Merchants Association has submitted a request to the Social Bureau to ban this practice. The producing areas around Tongli, Wujiang, have already complied with the request. In order to adulterate the rice ships, the cargo owners have suffered damage and loss of capital. Therefore, they have automatically increased the water freight and notified the ship owners not to cheat. However, the rice transported from Shengze and other places is still wet. Therefore, last winter, the Southern Rice Merchants Association again submitted a request to the Social Bureau to ban this practice. The Social Bureau issued a notice strictly prohibiting it and ordered the association to investigate it at any time and eliminate the evil practice of water adulteration by the end of last year. If it is found, the ship and cargo will be confiscated. The association notified the rice industry in various inland areas. The inland rice industry was very shocked. The ship and cargo business is different for each individual. Therefore, they have sent letters one after another, requesting the Southern Rice Merchants Association to ask the authorities to strictly prohibit it. If a rice ship is found to be adulterated with water, the rice should be reclaimed by the cargo owner, and the ship giant who cheated should be severely punished by the authorities. After receiving the letters, Yan Xiaoquan, chairman of the Southern Rice Association, believed that water adulteration was completely unrelated to the cargo owner. Therefore, yesterday, he convened various merchants and invited Zhu Zixiang, chairman of the Rice Dealers Association, and others to discuss the matter. The rice sold in the market is mostly from the south. Now, the incoming rice ships must be inspected by the association to ensure the quality of the rice before samples can be sold. Only then can the merchants buy it. If water adulteration is found, no matter which ship it is, there will be no leniency. The ship personnel will be sent to the authorities for severe punishment. However, the rice that has been adulterated with water will be put on the barge first, and the lender will be ordered to reclaim it, so as to protect the capital and avoid unnecessary accumulation. The municipal chamber of commerce is requested to reduce the business tax on foil</p>
<p>It should not be levied up to 1000 per thousand</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday requested the Zhejiang Finance Department by telegram to consider reducing the business tax on foil in Zhejiang Province to 1000 per thousand and to release the commercial goods first. The original telegram said: Wang, Director of the Zhejiang Finance Department, Jian: According to the report of the Foil Industry Association Preparatory Committee, the special tax on foil has been revoked by the provincial order and replaced by the Fenye tax, which is levied at a rate of 10% of the hundredth. A notice has been issued to collect the tax, and the transportation of foil in Shaoxing has been suspended for more than ten days. The source has been cut off, and all foil shops in the city have no goods to sell. Please telegraph Zhejiang to assist in releasing the goods in accordance with the example of other industries. It is learned that the current regulations on business tax in Zhejiang are only a draft and have not yet been finalized. Why is Shaoxing the first place to issue a notice to collect taxes on foil? Furthermore, the draft regulations stipulate that the business tax for industries such as candles and paper is only 5 per thousand, so why is the business tax on foil as high as 100 per thousand? Furthermore, the consumption tax on tin foil should be handled by the Ministry of Personnel and is within the scope of major regulations. It cannot be revoked by a provincial order. Therefore, if there are three taxes on tin foil in the future, a consumption tax and a business tax, and the business tax rate is so high, wholesale and retail will be taxed separately. That is, from the production to the consumer, tin foil will be subject to a consumption tax and two business taxes. According to the current tax rate proposed by Zhejiang Province, compared with the era of the special tax bureau for foil, only 12.5% ​​was levied, which was in effect throughout the country. It is not known how the bad products were produced, and the Zhejiang Provincial Business Tax Regulations Draft was signed by Chairman Wang of the Office of the Department of Finance. It is proposed to change the highest tax amount of foreign trade tax to 20 per thousand in order to slightly alleviate the burden on merchants. All business taxes on foil should be treated equally. Please consider adopting this in your department and finalize the regulations before implementing them. The business tax is paid once a month based on the turnover, income, or capital amount, which is different from the situation of the tax that is levied on goods. Please instruct the officials in charge there to release the goods first and wait for the department's instructions to approve the regulations before implementing them. Strictly prohibit operations. To pray for a reply, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Sugar tax rate is based on inspection grade</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry and Commerce approved the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday approved the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating that according to the telegram, it requested to reduce and improve the fees and procedures for inspection of sugar products. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce replied: The purpose of commodity inspection is to not only restrict inferior commodities but also research and improve them to improve commodity reputation and increase commodity value. The inspection fee is also based on the principle of taking from merchants and using it for merchants. The overall planning is extremely small, and the sugar product is only about 3 per thousand. As for the customs not re-examining, according to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's request, the customs were ordered to follow the instructions. Since the sugar product inspection was implemented, the tax collection has been based on the inspection report and the grade has been determined as the standard. The above-mentioned situation has been reported to the Ministry, and the Ministry of Finance has been consulted to investigate and handle it. In addition to issuing the original telegram to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau for attention, it is also ordered to be informed. This batch of county five districts is checking household registration.</p>
<p>Since Ge Xiusheng, the head of the fifth district of Shanghai County, was ordered to check the household registration, he has been preparing to proceed and convened all the leaders and deputy leaders of the Iron Army to discuss the investigation methods. After deliberation, it was decided that the heads and deputy heads of each township would be responsible for the investigation. The district office printed and distributed the household registration investigation instructions and trained the investigators before starting the investigation. At the same time, the district office organized three mobile inspection teams, each with two people, who took turns going to each township to supervise and guide the district head, who also served as the captain of the mobile inspection team, to supervise and instruct each township. Now that each township has completed the investigation and submitted it to the district, the district head is still afraid that it will not be accurate. He has changed the mobile inspection team to a random inspection team, led by the district head, to select townships with inadequate investigations for random inspections to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>Minhang District Dongxiang organizes self-defense groups</p>
<p>Dongxiang, Minhang Second District, Shanghai County, is located in Huxi and Qinzhi townships. The area is vast and borders the Pudong area. In recent years, due to the instability of the situation, there have been frequent appearances of thieves and robberies. Although the first branch of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau has added a police station, the police force is still weak. For example, on the night of the 23rd of last month, 50 or 60 bandits suddenly came to Jiang Yuanbu Village, the head of Qinzhi Township, surrounded the entire village, and robbed every household without exception. The patrol captain of the police station supervised the police officers and rushed to arrest them, but were injured instead. The bandits were so rampant that the villagers were unable to sleep peacefully. Therefore, the township and others jointly decided that in addition to sending letters to the Minhang Security Corps and the first branch of the Public Security Bureau to increase the number of regiment members and police officers for all-night patrols, they would also organize their own self-defense groups, selecting able-bodied men from each household, arranging teams, and conducting strict training, taking turns to defend every night to supplement the police force's inadequacies. They also detailed the various methods of inter-communal and inter-neighborly defense. If bandits are encountered, a team will be sent to arrest them on one hand, and cooperate in the investigation and suppression on the other hand, so that the escaped bandits will be afraid to hide. The detailed organization method of the self-defense group has been organized by the committee and has been drafted. The township head and others have submitted it to the district head and forwarded it to the county government for record.</p>

<p>Yiyang disaster victims delegation begs for alms</p>
<p>Appealing to the Red Cross The Chinese Red Cross received a telegram from the Yiyang disaster victims delegation in Henan yesterday, urgently disclosing the matter below. The telegram said: Since the 17th year of the Republic of China, Yiyang has suffered from frequent droughts and disasters. Last year, Feng Jun lost the battle, and the central army was stationed in Luoyang. Yiyang was in the middle, and no one was in charge of the chaos. As a result, bandits took the opportunity to rise up. To this day, no village or town in the county has escaped the bandit robbery. The most famous are Xicheng, Shiling, and other towns. More than 60 nearby were killed, more than 3,000 people were killed, and more than 7,000 men and women were taken as hostages. The burning of houses is even more questionable. Corpses are visible everywhere, and no one buries them. People are displaced, and the land is a desert area. The tragic situation is unbearable to see. This year, the war has been settled, and they have been compiled into military divisions, brigades, and regiments, with more than 10,000 people and more than 2,000 guns, stationed throughout Yiyang. According to the previous Feng Jun's payment for conscription, severe punishments and diligent searches, and the current supply, each two mu of land pays more than 360 yuan in tan fees. Recently, Wang Laoliu's brigade burned, killed, robbed, and raped in Xiyuan Village, Yiyang, and the losses were incalculable, resulting in strong men being forced to become bandits, and the old and weak died of starvation. The remaining disaster victims are really unable to survive and unable to die. Scholars have dropped out of school, workers have stopped working, merchants cry in the market, and farmers mourn in the fields. The severe winter has arrived, and the disaster victims have no clothes or food, crying and starving. They are breathing their last and are not guaranteed to survive the day. If they are not rescued urgently, there will be no survivors. We urge people from China and abroad and various charitable organizations to provide assistance. This is what we hope for. The Yiyang disaster victims delegation in Henan kowtows.</p>
<p>Commendable large sum to help vibration</p>

The association then allocated 10,000 yuan to Xuanhua and telegraphed Yu Guisheng to find enthusiastic and charitable comrades who can endure hardship and hardship to implement the rescue after confirming the letter. However, this money can only save 3,300 lives. It is not known how many people are sitting on thick funds at sea. They can all generously express their great wishes and donate money to disaster relief, either independently or by joining the association, which will definitely save countless disaster victims.</p>

<p>Commercial News, Finance, Gold Prices: Relentless Advance</p>
<p>The Strange Phenomenon Before the Swap</p>
<p>The Idea of Rising to 3.4 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 14th of January, the benchmark gold price showed another relentless increase, a reaction to three days of consecutive declines. The market situation is in a chaotic state, with endless changes. Sometimes the price difference between two or three taels and six or seven taels occurs. The total difference for the entire day reached twenty-three or four taels. The waves are treacherous and difficult to predict, causing terror and helplessness among the industry. As for the overseas silver market, it reported a slight increase again and remained unmoved. Therefore, the gold price opened higher and already exceeded the 700 tael mark. Many firms were buying, such as Hengyu, Taikang, Runzhi, Feng, Yongheng, Xingyuan, and the Dalian Group. Yuanmao, Yongda, Decheng, Yifeng, and Yongyuantai generally had more supply than demand. It seems that foreign exchange is tight, and the listed price has already increased by one level, indicating a continuing upward trend in the silver market. This is exactly what is meant by different trends in the open and the dark. Later, because sellers were still eager, the price broke through 700 taels and plummeted by 10 taels. Subsequently, various exchanges recovered, and there were rumors that a certain bank was absorbing spot goods, but this was just an atmospheric effect. Nevertheless, people's hearts were stirred up, and the price soared again by 10 taels. More buyers entered the market. Yuanxing, Yongheng, and Xingyuan Sheng, among others, all made purchases, while Taixing and hedgers cautiously took a step back, reacting very quickly. The price continued to rise sharply by more than 10 taels, suddenly surging to over 720 taels. The order was still good, with fluctuations of only two or three taels. It is likely that there was a shortage of bills of exchange because it was Wednesday. Afterwards, the price was calculated to be 718 taels and some change. This morning, the big bars showed a tendency to fall. Tomorrow (the 16th), the swap should open, and the bull side will still post offers, supposedly because of an excess of spot goods.</p>
<p>The morning market had an atmosphere of changing fortunes. From the early morning, the February opening price was 703 taels, an increase of 7 taels and 8 mace (gross price ranged from 702.3 to 704.5 taels, with more buyers). However, the big bars increased by one-eighth in the near term and one-sixteenth in the long term. The silver price rose by one-quarter. Later, because the United States was still selling, people's hearts turned in the opposite direction. Private telegrams also rose by one-quarter, while the market was stagnant, and exchange rates remained the same. Subsequently, Hengyu, Zhifeng, Yongcui, Tai, etc., all entered the market, and British gold was also firm. Banks were mutually trading April at 1 shilling and 4 pence, and the price soared to 706.5 taels when Dachengyi, Yifeng Yong, and retail investors sold off, and it was rumored that shillings would be listed long. Therefore, the price dropped by 10 taels. At 9:30 AM, HSBC listed the price long by .25, US dollar reduced by 2.375 cents, and Japanese yen reduced by 2.375 cents, at 697 taels. Moreover, banks traded April British gold at 140,625. After entering, buyers gradually moved, and the market was flourishing, rising by more than 8 taels. At 10 AM, it was over 705 taels. Mitsui and Mitsubishi traded US dollars for January at 32.1875 yuan, and Chinese and Japanese banks mutually traded April British gold at 1 shilling and 4 pence. Before long, the price suddenly dropped by four or five taels as Yu Da and others sold off. At 10:20 AM, it was 700 taels and .05 mace. Afterwards, Hengxing Yuan, Yongheng, and the Dalian Gang took advantage of this to drag in, and there was a rumor that banks were buying cash. At 10:45 AM, the price soared to 708 taels. Later, China Bank sold May British gold at 4 pence, and various firms in the market sold off one after another, so the price trended downwards. However, there was a latent three or four taels. After 11:30 AM, it had dropped to 02 taels. Yuanmao Yong and others sold off quite a bit. Suddenly, because British gold showed a suddenly beautiful image, the New York exchange absorbed 3-4 months at 13,875 or 8,125, so the market atmosphere suddenly showed a peak. The noon close was 06 taels and 2 mace, and it regained to seven or eight taels. But the wind and waves were huge, making it unpredictable. The listed price had been changed to 748 taels and 8 mace, and the Japanese yen was listed small by 2.375 cents, initially suppressing over 51 taels, and then only suppressing a small 41-42 taels.</p>
<p>The after-market presented a gradual upward trend. The after-market opened at 709 taels (gross range from 078 taels to 10 taels, the remaining atmosphere of noon). Following this, because Indian exchange rates repeatedly reported small, from 11 annas to 6 annas, and Changsheng, Yongtai, Hengyuan, Dade, or Cui Tai, etc., all bought in, and Yuanxing Yong bought in even more, the price soared, continuing to rise by more than 7 taels, with only two taels up and down. At 2:45 PM, it was 16.5 taels. Taixing came on stage to sell, receding by 2 taels. At 3:00, it was 14.5 mace. After that, Yuanxing Yongcui Taiyuancheng and others had already started to buy, and suddenly it returned high by 4 taels. At 3:45 PM, it was 18.6 mace. At this time, retail investors sold off, depreciating by more than 3 taels. Around 4:00, it was 15 taels. Afterwards, Yuanmao Yong and others bravely bought in, and each firm followed suit. In an instant, a good atmosphere, straight to the skies, jumping up five or six taels. At 4:20 PM, it reached 720 taels and 5 mace. Finally, there was a slight sell-off ahead, so the market closed at 4:30 PM at 718 taels and 6 mace. The closing price was suppressed again to 17 taels, comparing to the previous day, it rose again by a huge 23 taels and 4 mace. The largest price before and after the market was 720 taels and 5 mace, the smallest price was 697 taels, with a total of 23 taels and 5 mace of review. Merchandise opened early at 03 taels and 2 mace, noon close at 5.5 taels, afternoon at 9 taels, closing price at 18 taels. The listed price was calculated from 40 taels to 30 taels. There was still a double-closing price on the ledger, 706 taels in the morning and 18 taels in the afternoon. The replenishment water was 03 taels, and 15 taels in the afternoon. The market situation was swaying and extremely dangerous. Silver shop jewelry has already increased to 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Entering and exiting in a chaotic and complicated manner. Inter-firm transactions, including Chengfeng Yong, Hengyu, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Fuxingyong, Zhifeng Yong, Hengxing, Hengxingyuan, Zhaokang, etc., all entered. Taikangrun bought 2,000 bars. Wanxing Shunli's demand exceeded supply. Dadacheng, Yuanmao Shui, Yuantai, and Yifeng Yong all exited. Yucheng Yong entered and then exited. In the afternoon, Cui Tai, Yuanxing Yong, Changsheng Yong, Hengxing, Taikang Run, Yuantai, and Tai Hengyuan all entered. Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanmao Yong, Fuchang, etc., had irregular entries and exits. Taixing exited. Zhifeng Yong and Dadacheng had quite a few transactions, but they entered and exited alternately, and goods were sold. The Dalian Gang bought a total of 2,500-2,600 bars and sold 1,700-1,800 bars. The Guangdong Gang bought more than 1,000 bars. Foreign exchange had different trends in the open and the dark.</p>
<p>Listed prices were lengthened by one grade... The domestic market declined and then recovered.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and silver markets all reported increases, but sellers were not idle, and the market situation was flat. Exchange rates rose slightly. Yokohama and Kobe markets remained unchanged. As for HSBC's listed prices, various exchanges have lengthened by one grade. British gold added .25, at 1 shilling and 3 pence 75. The US dollar added half a yuan, at 31.875 yuan. Indian exchange increased by 1.5 yuan, at 88.5 rupees. The French franc increased by 13 yuan, at 812 yuan.

<p>The gold market suddenly and violently intersected, already balanced to the 720 tael mark. Major players chased and entered, especially with rumors that a certain bank was eating and receiving cash, so people's hearts were stirred up, soaring by more than 20 taels compared to the previous day, which was unexpected. By the noon close, various exchanges compared to the day before: British gold decreased by .1875, US dollar decreased by .375, and Japanese yen increased by 1.5 cents, truly a reaction after consecutive declines. However, in the afternoon, because it was Wednesday, there was usually no market, and Chinese merchants' transactions were not active. Only a few climbed in. Banks did more with each other, totaling about 200,000 pounds for British gold, and about 200,000 yuan for US dollars. The gold industry slightly closed, while Japanese gold was only several hundred thousand yuan.

<p>Yesterday's silver dollar market, each had its own similarities and differences. The price of the cent was not selling due to the source, and the bank's buying appetite was also weak, so the situation was generally downstream. Although the market recovered in the afternoon, it was difficult to see its turning point. The silver root was quite loose in the past, but at present, since January, it has had a good atmosphere, so the silver dismantling is always above 1 cent. However, the copper yuan has shrunk sharply in recent days, and has returned to a new low of 60,000 yuan, causing the listed exchange price to be greatly hit.</p>

Comparison of the benchmark gold price and the big bar price in December of the 19th year.</p>
<p>Benchmark Gold Price Frequently Soars... The Highest Price Emerges Endlessly.</p>
<p>Big Bar Shrinks Sharply... New Low Price Repeatedly Appears and Never Ends.</p>
<p>The benchmark gold price's rise was unusually fierce this month, irresistibly so, even more intense than in June and July, leading to frequent highs. Although there was some hovering in between, the advance was rapid and the retreat slow, with large increases and small pullbacks, and the news was divergent, with even more dramatic changes. At every turn, there were rises and falls of several taels, causing the industry to lose its bearings, and the general shorts were hit hard. Looking back at the previous month, the highest price had increased by a huge 80 taels. The main reasons for this were the sharp drop in silver prices, the repeated shrinking of the exchange market, and the difficulty in seeing the implementation of the United States' plan to rescue the silver market. On the contrary, there was news of selling raw silver. Russia also closed Japanese banks, and speculators feared that the exchange rate between Japan and the United States would rise, so they rushed to buy. It was also rumored that a large amount of cash was being exported, and the bank repeatedly received cash, which caused people's hearts to be high. It was found that the highest this month was 679.5 taels, the lowest was 595.9 taels, and the average price for the whole month increased by 55.8 taels compared to the previous month, with the price ratio increasing by 15.5.</p>
<p>Big Bar: The big bar has repeatedly shrunk sharply this month, with frequent new lows that have never been seen before. Although the United States is trying to raise silver prices, it has not been effective. The reason is that there are many sellers and buyers are helpless. Persia also has a huge amount of cash to export for sale, and India also intends to sell its silver reserves to the market. Coupled with the sluggish world economy and weak purchasing power, the need is small, and the silver price is increasingly trapped in a sad situation. It was found that the highest recent term was 16 pence and 312.5, and the lowest was 14 and a half pence. The average price for the whole month fell by 1 penny and 44 compared to the previous month, with the price ratio falling by 4.4. Now, the list of the real prices of the benchmark and the big bar for the past year is as follows: Year, Month, Benchmark Gold, Big Bar, Real Price, Price Ratio, Real Price Unit, Price Ratio.</p>
<p>Year Month Gold Bar Real Price Price Ratio Real Price Single Price Ratio 19 December 641.700 177.9 15.192 46.9 19 December 458.477 121.5 22.305 68.8 19 January 474.296 131.5 20.946 64.7 19 February 490.700 136.0 20.094 62.1 19 March 498.585 138.2 19.286 59.5 19 April 500.200 138.6 19.546 60.3 19 May 517.412 143.4 18.963 58.5 19 June 591.204 163.9 16.625 51.2 19 July 591.752 164.0 15.955 49.3 19 August 564.260 156.4 16.268 50.2 19 September 553.024 153.3 16.757 51.7 19 October 572.754 158.8 16.575 51.4 19 November 586.100 162.4 16.655 51.2</p>

Others were even more desolate. Spot transactions were also extremely rare. Only 14,500 yuan were opened for the whole day.

<p>Yarn and Flower Yarn Market is Progressing.</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm and the rise is very strong, but the sale of ready-made yarn is increasingly feeling deserted. Various gangs do not have an excited atmosphere, but people's hearts are quite good, because the bottom goods are reduced (approximately within 100,000 packages), so although the current business is clear, there is no impact on the market, and some manufacturers have a special concentration of thoughts, and many agree, and a wave of buyers flock in, but it has risen 12-13 taels since the lower level, or there is the ability to fall back.</p>
<p>Human Standard Reaches Two Taels. The human standard opened in the previous market, the market atmosphere was very firm, as the price of gold rose again, and the wind of raw cotton also rose sharply. There was a lack of sellers in the market, and each rose 6-8 qian to 1 tael and 1 qian.

The Cotton Market Scene is Excellent.</p>
<p>The cotton market is still firm, and the rising trend is sharp. Later, as the price of gold tended to rise again, and the bottom goods were thin, and Japanese merchants had the theory of packing and exporting fire engine flowers, the buyer's courage became stronger and the hearts of the people became even firmer. The sellers all seemed to be startled birds, and as soon as it rose, the buying mood became even stronger. The ready-made cotton transaction was very clear, and the attitude of the holders was strong and arrogant, with no intention of accommodating, but the Han gang slightly threw out the clouds.</p>
<p>Han Standard Good Half Taels The Han Standard opened in the previous market, and the hearts of the people were quite strong due to the remaining energy of the previous day, and each rose by 2-3 qian.
