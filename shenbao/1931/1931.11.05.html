<p>（南京）　外交部三日訓令駐日公使蔣作賓照會日本政府、駁復不撤兵理由、照會全文昨己由外部正式發表、兹錄如下、「爲、照會事、接准十月三十一日來照、業經閱悉、查國際聯合會行政院十月二十四日、要求佔領中國東北各地之日本軍隊、於十一月十六日前、完全撤退之决議案、係經行政院會員國十三國一致之贊成、中國政府深信貴國政府必能尊重維持世界和平最高機關之意思、實行該决議案且行政院九月三十日之决議案係經貴國完全接受、國際聯合會因是確信貴國必將立即開始撤軍、於二星期内可告結束乃貴國竟未履行、故行政院於十月二十四日重申前案再定期間以逹恢復原狀之目的、本國政府依據行政院之决議、邀請貴國政府指派代表商訂關於撤退及接收之細目、來照末段亦稱貴國政府願意迅速開始商議此項細目、　爲欣慰中國政府兹己派定接收委員會、并經通知貴國政府、仍請貴國速派代表與本國所派人員、商訂上述細目務於十一月十六日前、完全撤退飯佔各地、至來照所稱、日本政府之方針、希望開始商榷確立中日平常關係基礎大綱一節、查中國政府極願依照行政院之建議、俟撤兵完成後、開始交涉兩國間之懸案、并設立調解委員會或類此之永久機關、但在撤兵尙未定成前、所有商議、自應限於撤軍及接收之細目、中國政府關於此事之意見、己於十月三十一日通告國際聯合會、并請查照、須至照會者、（三日專電）</p>

<p>對基本原則略變主張</p>
<p>（東京）　此間官塲今日表示日本在國聯行政會集會時所將採行之方針、日本對於法外長白里安所提出關於條約問提題交公斷之點、將仍要求中國承認一切條約（連民國四年條約在内）有效、日本答白里安之文大、約明日可發出、覆文中將說明此項要求、白里安於評論日本所提出以作解决滿洲事件根據之基本原則時、以爲中國旣己準備將條約提交海牙公斷、則日本之第五點、…即條約權利之尊重…應可解决日本發言人對此意見、答稱、使日本軍事行動合法之唯一事件、即日本所認爲之中國蔑視條約耳、中國蔑視條約、致釀成危及日本在滿地位之極不美滿事態而此地位固與日本生存至有關係也、此種不美滿事態、卒引起目前暴發、是以非至中國承認條約拘束後日本决不能依允恢復原狀云、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　如今晚負責任方面所傳之消息果確、日本於基本原則五條己變更其主張、聞日本雖仍力主中國應承認其條約拘束、但日本致白里安之覆文、聲明日本準備與中國開撤兵談判、）與承認五基本原則之談判併同進行、按日本前所主張者、中國應先承認基本原則而後始允與開撤兵談判、東京現殷待南京對此變更之反響數方面之意、恐未必有何效果、蓋南京政府堅主須先撤兵而後開談判也（四日路透社電）</p>

<h3 id="c26">絶食呼籲和平 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>自東北事件燦發以來。國人怵外患之日亟。痛内亂之無己義憤所激。不可遏抑。於是蹈海自殺者有之。斷指血書者有之。近復有天津北洋工學院代理院長王季緒。及鎭江中學學生鮑恩獻薛白因之悲憤絶食。冀以艱苦之行動。迫切之呼籲。促起當局之最後覺悟。俾和平統一能得早日實現。此種愛護國家之熱忱。與艱難卓絶之苦行。誠足以動天地而泣鬼神。其舉可敬。其事則尤足哀。嗚呼民之所惡。竟有甚於死者。吾人聆此。更復能作何言。</p>
<p>雖然。吾人究有未能己於言者。絶食呼籲。苦則苦矣。誠則誠矣然而此種消極怯弱之表示。在事實上旣未必遂能促起當局之悔悟。而在認識上。適足以證明其未能認清本身所處之地位與神聖之權力。故其在意識上所表現者。有類乎「愚忠。」冀以致誠上動天聽。而在行爲上所表現者。則又近乎「尸諫。」竭其愚忠。陳尸以諫。稽之往古。亦未必遂能挽回「天意。」時至今日。封建君主愛國愛民之道德意識。旣己完全剷去。而個人主義的利己觀念。支配慾望。則顚撲不破。連年内戰伏尸千里。今年水災。萬里陸沉。日禍突發。山河破碎。民生憔悴。國勢飄摇。凡此事實。呈現目前。其慘傷危難。足以令人動心駭目而予以深刻之剌激者。奚止萬千倍於三數人之絶食。而當局於此事實。竟若漠不動心。－則又豈三數人之絶食與㣲弱之呼籲。所能促其覺悟。喚起其自動悔禍之心。夫民主之國。以民爲基。主權在民政府措施乖方。則人民應起而大聲發言。以大衆之公意。監督政府之行動。使其無悖於大衆之利益。此乃爲負責之民衆。此乃爲足以立國之民衆。移絶食之苦行。移痛哭流涕之精誠。致力於其他正當而有效之工作。何事不成。己有權而不行使。己有力而不發揮。徒以怯弱之行爲。效尸諫之故智。吾見其愚矣。未見其可也。日人有名彼末者。於上月二十三日在大阪滿蒙時局懇談會中。曾謂「中國人個性最强。好似一粒之沙。而日人形成一國家時則最强。恰如士敏士。」此言最足以促我國人之反省。王君等之絶食呼籲。正所謂沙之堅强也。但散漫之沙基。終不能建築崇樓大厦。膠凝散沙。團結牢固。發揮沙之堅强。使成爲士敏土之堅强。換言之。即應以積極之精神。喚起國人作堅强之團結。以共弭内亂。共禦外侮。王君等之絶食。正無異於蹈海自殺。除博取社會數聲低微之慨嘆。益消失青年進取奮鬥之精神而外。他復何有。此事實之足以使吾人感喟無己者己。</p>
<p>於此吾人更敢正告當局。内困洪水。外迫强敵。民生瘡痍未起。失士未復。國如纍卵。民苦流離。人復何心。尙不能竭誠共信。同赴國難。張伯苓先生曾以蹴球喻政治。謂蹴球之目的。在於蹴入對方之球門。但絶非一球負戰刀匹馬所可長驅直入。一脚蹴進。必全隊球員互相傳遞。協力共進。使能破除阻力攻入敵門。爲政之道。正復如斯。力不必出諸一己。功不必自我獨成。此喻最切。民苦深矣。民望切矣。即使目前之和平統一。爲相安於一時之局面。民衆固亦足以慰情勝無。彼三數人之绝食。固不足畏。而此三數人怨生樂死心理上之普遍。則最足畏。人民今都具此心理矣。當局再不覺悟。更待何時。</p>

<p>各位同志、中央與廣東代表同志在滬最近商量的情形、有幾件要說明的事、現在報告一下、昨天上海報紙登載消息、說要澈查中央社所發表的關於粤方所提黨政改革案的中央復電這兩個電報、一個是中央派去上海幾位代表囑鐵城同志拍來的、一個是中央方面答復關於黨政改革案的電報由本席簽名發出的、這兩個電報、原電統統存在昨天上海報上載有要澈查來源的話、現在我可以把這兩個原電念一遍、上海的電報、是十月二十八日來的、原文如、下蔣主席鈞鑒、密今早未會議前、粤方代表提出黨政改革案、蔡先生等以此案關係重大、中央未之前聞、不便討論、兹將該案電陳如後、（按該案原文己見三十一日本報）蔡先生等囑電請示如何應付、請示遵、鐵城勘、我們去的電報、原文是上海張巿長勛鑒、密譯轉李先生曁鐵城先生鑒、鐵兄勘電奉悉、黨政改革提案内容姑不具論、精神上即與團結對外之主張不相、合此時爲黨爲國、均惟有從速集合首都、共赴國難、黨政根本問題、應俟本黨多數之討論决議、斷無以十餘人在租界内談商即可决定全黨全國大計之理、吾輩旣爲黨員、黨章必須共守同爲國民、應急國家之難、苟爲忠實同志、愛黨救國、出於眞誠、而非如外間所譏以權利分贓爲目的者、此等違反黨章不恤國難之提案、不應提出討論、以負國民之熱望、特此奉復、中正艶未、由這電報原文、自可明白事實眞象、不必多費解釋、現在中央方面、極願精誠團結、一致對外、所有這些細碎節目的事實、都没有去計較、隨便他們怎樣發表和登載、都置之不問不過昨天的紀載好像說是中央揑造電報、没有這個電報發表的樣子、所以不得不證明事實、現在上海報紙所登的消息、幾乎全是廣東一方面的話、中央始終守着沉默、毫不理會、無非苦心希望團結之成功這一層、全國國民黨能了解、不過各報登載、應有一種明確的認識、現在國難當前、應有是非的判斷、我們主張尊重言論自由、但决不可以假借言論自由之名、就可顚倒是非抹煞事實、使得人心惶惑社會不安、在這種情况之下、黨的團、結就不僅無補於黨無補於對外、且將使外交加重其困難、國家更趨於危難、因此即可使國家基礎全國人心都完全摇動、這豈是精誠團結的道理、廣東到上海的代表、如果是精誠團結、誠意共赴國難、就决不會不顧到摇動人心撼動國本、還有使中央同人對於這次的團結、只要能夠早日實現、什麽委屈苦痛、都能忍受、所以對於己往的種、種一槪視爲過去只求能團結一致對外、但是中央對於團結、求之太切的時候、或許有人以爲是中央不得了了、非一切聽人支配不可、又好像是現在的中央是被征服了一樣、一切要承受廣東的命令、何况廣東政府並未曾征服中央、即使征服了中央、有何光榮呢、不說是中央、就說是我中正個人、爲廣東同志屈服了、亦還不是黨員屈服了黨員、朋友先輩屈服了後進、中國人屈服了中國人、有何勝利光榮可言呢、又或者有人以爲廣東政府存在、就可牽制中央、就可使中央的外交地位動摇、按道理、講如果廣東代表眞正願意團結一致對外、爲着外交的事情、廣東政府格外要趕快無條件的取消、以求全國團結見之事實纔是、不能再留着廣東政府與中央爲對抗之形式、否則就不啻是帮助日人來欺侮本國、不是眞正的一致救國救黨的道理、這是應向大家說明的第一點、第二、點我們爲着熱望團結、縱不必嚴格的講是非、但是我們依做人的道理說對於朋友或對於敵國、都應有一個很誠實的態度、希望朋友均做好人、希望敵國也終能夠做一個朋友、有總理博愛的精神、纔算是總理信徒、所以我們無論對於朋友、甚至敵人、總不好使他們有毁壞人格的事情、現在我們革命所依爲原則的、第一是總理的主義和全部遺敎、第二是本黨的黨章、第三是約法、如果有一個朋友來勸我們說黨章可以遷就來順從少數人的意思、這是我們所不能做的、如果有人說約法雖是全國人的意思、也可不必遵守、只要順從幾個廣東同志的話就好了、這樣抹殺全國國民的公意、違背全國國民所定的約法、與全黨黨員所定的黨章、聽少數人的意思所指使、犧牲全體國民與全黨黨員、也是我們所不能做的、我們旣是一個朋友、爲什麽要呌朋友違反國民公意呢、君子愛人以德、中國國家事情弄不好、多半就是因爲遷就私人情感、而不顧黨國大難的原故、尤其是是非不明、我們更要格外注意、現在國難當前、全賴本黨先進指導我們一條光明的正路、决不好强人做違反黨國犧牲全國公意的事情、或者拿少數人的意見與局部的問題、來動摇全國、使中央政府在外交上没有辦法、我想廣東老同志愛黨愛國、决不至如此、有人儘管詆毁我、我中正個人都可忍受、但我决不能違反黨國的法紀、負了我們國民、背了我們總理、我早己决心、即使全國國民全體同志都不惜違背約法和黨章、但我中正個人决不能毁壞約法違背黨章、希望廣東幾位老同志拿革命先進的態度、來指導我們後輩、要使我們後輩不做背反黨國違法亂紀的事情、來製造今後幾十年的禍亂我在上海己經對廣東各代表講過、他們都是先進、我是後輩、如果先進以好榜樣敎我們、則我們没有不遵循的、如果今日遺留了一個不好的因子、恐永爲將來黨國的罪人、所以祗要各位先進拿出光明正大的態度和辦法來、我們全體黨員、一定都願跟着照正大光明的道路上走、决不會有反對的道理、我相信任何先進、决不能夠呌我們違反黨章破壞約、法二十年來禍亂的覆轍、我們不能再蹈、那種禍亂、到民國二十年還没有止、我們還忍心再造以後二十年禍亂出來嗎、我以爲老同志終要使我們黨員起尊敬之心、而不可使我們後輩背黨違法、更不可使我們後輩失敬失禮、如果後輩對先進失敬失禮、雖然其咎在後輩、但先進老同志亦與有責、這一點、我們很希望在上海的各同志、有一種深切的了解、現在國難當前的時候、决不是少數人在上海日復一日的議論可收功效、而任何國家的大計、不可以撇開首都而在租界内談議的、宋臣議論未定、金兵己經渡河、事果至此、國且不存、又何有於個人呢、這個時候、祗要有利黨國個人一切、都不成問題、所以我對表示下野的通電、當粤方同志到上海那天、即己交給他們、而且己簽字、請他們發表、但他們當時却並不主張發表、而到今日似乎反以我爲食言、殊爲可惜其實廣東單方面爲我擬就而未經我同意的電稿、早由廣東方面於十月上旬在廣州香港各埠新聞紙上非正式披露、以致天津北平各報紛紛轉載、弄到全國人心動摇以爲我就要辭職下野致使社會軍隊、一般人心、完全不安、廣東同志一而將他們自擬而未經我同意之稿早在各處披露、而一方面於他們到滬之日我所簽名提出之原稿、則謂未至發表時期又擱置不發、徒使人心皇然、舉國動、摇對我之去留、猜測莫定、如果眞是愛護黨國、愛護後、進精誠團結、先輩同志、我相信他們决不是有意來弄我後輩的、後來廣東代表又來函、說這電用意、並非抛棄責任、這明明要使我以臨去之身、仍負重責、但這電旣發以後、此責又如何負起、徒使中外心理、不明中樞寄託之所在、對内對外、無人負責國家危險更不堪問、所以我於上月三十日函告蔡張諸先生、以今日人心皇皇、險象更明、不應徒發表示式的通電、必須先推定合法負責繼任的人、方能發此通電、而且通電發出之日、應即爲我實行辭職卸責之日、决不可留空隙、使國家政治中斷、當此危急存亡之秋、我人對於黨國負有重責、更不可欺人欺世、兒戲國事、使國家陷於無政府狀態、所以我說、我個人什麽都可以犧牲、但却不可以將國家法紀破壞、不可以將政府的基本破壞、也不能將總理遺傳下來的本黨系統破壞、最近有人述上海某同志談、不僅要蔣下野、還要蔣到外國去、永遠不許蔣回到中國來、這話還有人說是胡先生所說的、我實在不相信、因爲胡先生向來是指敎我們愛護我們的、而且是無成見的、如果我有、錯他儘可以明白責備、何必說這話呢、即使他有這話、也是一種平常戲言、不是他從心裏想說的話、所以有没有人說這話、我皆不問、至於我個人立塲、祇要與黨國有益我不僅是被逐、就是死也甘心情願、、如果我下野、黨國就可以健全、外交也可以勝利、我雖死也願意、如果我没有這必死的决心、今天就不會在南京、如果我没有殉黨的决心、我於十五六年時早己因爲共産黨賣空買空造謡中傷的隂謀趕跑了、如果我没有臨難殉國的决心、亦可於十五年在濟南給日本人砲火趕跑了、共産黨和日本軍閥的手段、本是如此、但是我們同志間、總應該親愛精、誠即使不爲友朋體恤艱難、亦應爲國家和總理歷史的關係留點餘地、朋友要在危難的時候才見精誠、革命亦要在越加危難的時候、越加要尊重我們的職守遵守、黨國的法紀、才能算是革命者、外國各友邦視察我們中國的前途、完全在我們中央及政府同志是不是能夠奮鬥到底、並不至因爲廣東一部份的變故、和廣東少數人的糾紛、來動摇我們中央在國際間的信用、或許各友邦知道我們、中央處在這種内外夾攻的時候、仍能奮鬥到底、負責不懈、不愧爲國際間的一個朋友、更加重視中國人格、幫助我們完成革命事業、所以要拿少數和局部的問題、來牽制外交、摇動全國將總理有生以來本黨系統、和革命的歷史事實、要統統抹殺、那是必不可能的事情、所以我相信廣東幾位老同志、决不會有此用心、而且相信他們終能愛護黨國實現和平、齊來首都、共赴國難、决不使此次團結、再有破裂之象、我本來對廣東接洽之初、提出三個原則、至今仍守這三個原則、一如粤方中能負全責則在中央同人、儘可退讓一切、請在粤同志整個的遷來首都、改組政府、至中正個人下野更無問題、祗要粤中能確實負責、前來接代、則中正即可通電下野、二、如粤中不能負責、則應歸中央主持、而廣東政府、自當取銷、粤方同志、即齊集首都、共赴國難、三、如要各方合作、則中正更爲歡迎、但必須來京面商、方是開誠相見同舟共濟之道、現在我們所走的是第三條路、但祇是坐在上海、論黨政改革制度不來急國家之難、徒使夜長夢多、人心惶惑、不但不能减少中央艱危、而且使黨國更</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>增險象、這豈是團結對外之宗旨、實爲加速黨國的危亡、我相信本黨的先進、决不會如是來領導我們後輩的、我十分誠懇、希望在上海的各同志、遵守最初拯救黨國一致對外的初衷、從速集合首都、共赴國難、我並且希望一般國、民尤其是新聞記者、要一切以國家利益爲前提、明是非辨公私在這國家生死存亡的時候、如果國人没有一個準確的目、標那末國家就不免危亡、種族也不免絶滅了、今天紀念週在總理遺像面前、可以向政府同人聲言、中正一息尙存、必當犧牲個人、促成本黨團結、實現和平统一、尤必擁護約法、遵守黨章到底、以報答黨國和我們己死的總理、其他毁譽利害、進退成敗、都不足以動摇我的决心、希望各位同志了解此意、在此内外夾攻之時、更應守法盡職負、責努力、貫澈向來和平统一的主張、無愧爲總理信徒、幸甚、（四日專電）</p>

<p>黄康屯君旅外執敎有年、頃自南洋歸來、記者訪之寓邸、至則見其桌上陳一花籃、粲然如琪瑶、蓋星加坡海中所産之珊瑚巖也、黄君在檳榔嶼中學任敎三年仰光中學二年、對於英屬海峽殉民地及缅甸等處僑界情形、娓娓而談記者以其有關華僑敎育、特約誌問答如下、</p>
<p>（問）僑校普遍之近况與效果若何（答）僑校近况非數說所能盡、槪約言之則於近年不景氣狀况中努力掙扎、可謂風雨如晦、鷄鳴不己華僑自辦學校之歷史最久尙不過三十年鼎革以後、乃如雨後春筍、星加坡檳榔嶼各埠僑社國語己可通行、近年反日運動標語口號雖不若國内之可以高呼廣貼、而實際杯葛、則較國内各地尤爲堅持澈底、最近東省被刦、熱憤誌哀之表露、尤見深刻、即此數端、可以見華僑敎育潛在滋長之效果爲不可忽視矣、</p>
<p>（問）華僑中等敎育發展之程度若何、（答）南洋各地華僑小學、頗形發逹、雖山陬海澨凡有數十家華僑商店即可聽到「三民主義」之黨歌聲、惟中等敎育則除星洲華中己有高中班次外、其他各埠之中、學只至初中階段、規模設備與學生數量方面、均不若英人所設同等學校之寛敞完備、惟較諸華僑自辦各小學爲頭角崢嵘而己、以余（黄君自稱）所服務之檳城仰光兩中學而言、檳城規模雖小、而生氣充實學生發逹至無隙可容、不得不亟謀實際之擴充仰校規模寛大而缺乏生氣、生徒寥寥、最近且以種種故障、暫告停頓、至此兩校所以一赢絀之最大原因檳榔嶼以地位關係有各方外埠學生之輻　、北自暹羅缅甸、南自吉隆坡以北馬來半島各小坡、西自蘇門答臘、俱有僑生遠道來學、故學生發逹而校基易固、仰光雖爲缅甸首府旅缅三十萬華僑祗此一中學、但各坡華校學生數量均不甚多、故中學肄業生不易發逹然以該校地位之寛、校舍之敝、際此不妨改爲華僑公學、自幼稚園以至男女完全小學、將仰光現有按舍太狹之華校併合辦理然後徐圖恢復、則大有可爲也、</p>
<p>（問）以南洋華僑人數之多、資力之厚、自辦學校亦己有相當歷史、顧何以尙無大學之設立、（答）從華僑數量與社會文化各方之實際需要而論、實有自建大學之必要、經濟方面亦綽有設立之可能、即如缅甸仰光大學星洲萊佛士大學雖係英士所設、而華僑方面、捐資報效、不在少數、其所以勇於助人而怯於自建者、一則由於國内辦理大學資望相當之人材、未有向外作登高之呼二則旅外較久之華僑富家、類多趨崇白人敎育其子弟從幼即送入英文學校、轉而留學英美、以博當地之榮譽、其宗仰祖國者、子弟纔畢業小學、即多遣其升學國内對於當地自辦之中學反缺乏信任心、三則僑中積資碩望之士、類多分道揚鑣、各行其是缺乏協作忱意與堅强之組織能力、故尙無自動建立最高學府之動議、實則大學敎育、貴能因地制宜、白人之在南洋、爲數不過占全人口數十分之一、而高等敎育之建設、頗著以進行、肄業學生、華巫印土、各色俱有白人自身反多不肯任其子弟與殖民地有色人種同堂肄業吾人乃徒舍己之田、芸人之田、是亦可慨也、</p>

<p>尼采說得好。「你們須得追求你們的仇敵。你們須得舉起你們的戰爭。」我不勸你們去工作。我勸你們去戰爭。我不勸你們求和平。我勸你們求勝利。使你們的工作成爲戰爭。」尼采是德國近世有名的哲學家。他的超人主義的哲學。影響於德國的民族性者甚大。我覺得像我國這樣麻大的民族。處在這公理湮没倭寇横行的東亞。這種積極進取的精神。是我們應當提倡的。</p>

<p>國民社十月三十日從威明敦來電說·愛迪生遺囑將愛迪生公司資産約值一千四百萬美金悉給後妻之子，僅以住宅變爲基金生息分給前妻的生子女六人，現前妻之子惠廉聲稱將向法庭抗爭……中國一般老夫子看了這個電報便批評說「愛迪生大槪是没有讀過大學，所以鬧出這個亂子。大學上明明的說「物格而后知致；而后意誠意誠而后心正心正而后身修身修而后家齊家齊而后國治國治；而後天下平。」誰呌他只會格物而不會齊家？」</p>
<p>社會主義者也不饒恕他。他們說：</p>
<p>「錢是社會的，你該父傳給子，子傳給孫。錢如肥料堆在幼苗上，太多了，會把幼苗燒死。你把一千四百萬美金堆在後妻之子一個人身上，愛他反而害他。你不啻呌他拿了用不完的錢去吃喝嫖賭，把愛子活埋在安樂鄉裏。惠廉也没得出息。你該學你父親去發明創造，不該來揩他的油。承繼遺産己是没有出息；何况與弟弟爭遺産，那是更不長進了。」總而言之，拿産業傳给後人是最笨的一件事。愛迪生是一個絶頂聰明人而在處置遺産上是和李鴻章，盛宣懷一樣的笨累得親骨肉打起官司來，讓律師們發財，這是出乎我意料之外的。</p>

<p>— 鄭兆熹</p>
<p>夏威夷島在太平洋中。其形如聯珠。大小計有八島。面積六千六百方里島中農産甚豐。風景絶佳。有太平洋中之天堂稱。地點雖處熱帶内。但有海洋氣候之調和。入夏毫不炎熱。近人避暑多遊息焉。該島治權聞最初爲當地土司握管。至西歷一千八百九十八年。美國入境勢力擴大。遂歸其屬領。後此有志之士。累謀獨立未果。梁任公曾於一千八百九十九年游美經過日記一節。頗多興感。錄之如後。</p>
<p>「……前在島中女主。今屏居華盛頓府。夷爲編氓。江山如此坐付他人。月明故國。不堪回首。讀李後主眼淚洗面之詞句。旁觀猶爲傷心。不知彼婦獨居深念。何以爲情也。嗚呼。莫過烏衣巷。是别姓人家新畫梁。美哉此太平洋之樂園獨惜享受之者。非彼都之主也。……」</p>
<p>嘻。任公固一多情者亦深於愛國之人也。今見他人亡國喪地猶代人悲慨若此。此時又安知四十年後之中國。亦實逼處此矣。泉下有知。不知悲慨何極。（却酬）</p>

<p>金壇東門外。有鎭曰堯塘。塘西南去五里。有小村落。地處僻靜。人跡罕至俗呼爲惡狗村。村中居民。不滿十家。而家家養狗。狗性率兇殘異常。主人以防暴客宵小。平時乞丐相戒弗敢入村。即行人偶過者。亦必先央求村人。爲之引導防護焉。村中狗且具有特性。專嗜食死人肉四境浮厝之新墳。幾無一完者。往往深夜無。人狗覓得一棺。舉頭一擊。破之即伸頭入。銜屍拖出。相與大嚼。及翌晨村人往視。則白骨狼籍矣。秋夜凉天。有漁人某甲。張網於村外河濱。事捕魚工作。夜半人倦欲眠。見其旁灘上。有採菱者所遺之小舟。甲即就其中假寐。不覺入睡鄉。不意狗往見之、誤以舟爲棺、以甲爲死人也。逕前猛齕其首、拖之出舟、甲痛極而醒與狗相搏大呼救命村人聞聲。驚起集、視爲之解圍、而甲己面目模糊。血汚難認天明舁入鎭上就醫、余友某君時適在鎭。覩狀。怪而詰之。得其情。轉以告余不啻聊齋所稱之「野狗子」也。噫、俗說隂曹地府有惡狗村不意其即在人間。則人間信有地獄歟。</p>

<p>導游</p>
<p>東西各文明國都中。皆有導游之册北平爲吾國文化中心。遠近聞風興羡而願一游者。不知幾千萬人。而終無可以指導游人之書。何其異哉。自日下舊聞以下。考證燕都史蹟之書何止充棟然爲學人探索之資則可爲游者之指南。則游者有所不暇讀也。歐西人士紀述北京之作亦己不尠。然終多隔膜。且亦不協最近情况。邇日閩人陳宗蕃者燕都叢考三編。周述城之内外坊巷園林故蹟證以近事。足爲實用之資。然仍偏於史蹟者多。非專爲導游而作。若巿肆貿易飲食游處之類。不登於策也。坊間所出指南。則索然寡味不足以發游賞之情。民國十八年春間。巿政府繁榮設計委員會擬出一書應此需要。業己具稿政局旣變。遂束高閣。又該會以西人來游者人地生疎。輒雇北京飯店左近之露天通事爲游侣此輩胸無點墨。於史蹟旣瞢無所知。襲謬沿訛。足貽國恥。議開傳習所以養成此等人才。此事亦卒無所就。今每年美國游歷團數百人雜還來臨。巿政府縱能派員招待。亦斷無逐一爲之疏釋之理巿民團體旣未發逹亦無此能力盡地主誼試思彼跋涉萬里而來觀國之光。入此名都。闃無人焉旣不知應詣何處。亦不知可購何物。倀倀然俯仰隨人目迷五色如聾如盲。莫能名焉而去其去。後之感想爲何如邪。言念及此。可爲長歎。今巿政府動以經費無出爲患。試思每來一游客。至少在北平須費百元。此百元者。即北平巿上之流人資金也。巿商會爲接受流入資金計。宜與巿政府合作。創一大規模之欵賓社。專取能投西人嗜好之商品。陳列其間以吾國固有藝術精神布置之以歐文標明價格聘有新商業知識而能歐語者任招待之責。即以其赢餘經理上述之二事。固绰然有餘裕。而何患乎費之無從出哉。或曰。二十年春間。歐美同學會曾開美術工業展覧會。而所獲蓋寡。此事殆不易爲。殊不知所陳列者不當限於美術工業。即飲食服御玩好凡爲吾國之特産皆可蒐羅。若專以高價之珍物求售。宜其難矣此自在於商家自動爲之而政府加以指導協助急起直追。猶未晚也。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>他自言自語地說着，也没有人去理他坐在他。對面的看報朋友，看完了正張，又看那附送的畫報。鄉下人依然看他的那一面不想他的眼晴正射過去，忽然跳起來道:</p>
<p>「反了反了－這個世界眞反了，－」全三等車裏的人，被他那們一嚷，不知道是什麽緣故，一個鄉下老頭兒，難道是有神經病的嗎?大家都來問他到底是什麽事？</p>
<p>「這個世界眞反了。」他還是摇頭歎氣，接着說道:「莫怪阿水金篤娘，說上海不是好地方，連春宫畫報也出了。」</p>
<p>「那裏有什麽春宫畫報呢？」那位坐在對面看報的先生起初因爲報紙遮着面孔鄉下人也没有看得清楚，現在方看見一位青年好像是一個大學校學生　　「還說不是春宫畫報嗎」鄉下人指着這青年,手裏的畫報。「那上面不是都印着精赤條條不穿褲子的姑娘們照片嗎？突着大奶奶，躬着大屁股揸量我鄉下人,這點點也瞧不清楚嗎?」</p>
<p>原來這畫報上,印着一張法蘭西巴龍的人體美名畫還有近來的許多女游泳家的幾張照片雖然伊們都穿了游泳馬甲，那肌膚豐美的雙乳當然凸出在前面上海人己經司空見慣那些照相的姑娘們早己大大方方恬不知羞，却把那個鄉下老頭兒大驚小怪起來了。</p>
<p>「這就是呌做美。術這又呌做人體美，曲線美你那裏懂得」那位青年當然要給畫報上辯護。</p>
<p>「我固然不懂這就呌做美術嗎?謝謝吧－我總不相信世界上要脫了褲子，纔算是美的。你說了許多什麽美,什麽美我也記不清楚許多，要是不穿褲子就算美，那末我們這一火車的人,大家把褲子脫下來大家何妨來美一美咧。」鄉下人倒越說越有勁,什麽野話都要說出來了。</p>
<p>「要美的人裸體了,纔顯出美來。不是隨便什麽人都可以顯出美來。像你這樣的鄉下老頭子,一副焦黄枯瘦的皮骨·難道祼體以後，也說你有什麽曲線美人體美嗎?」那個青年倒也口頭不肯讓人。</p>
<p>「我自然是一個焦黄枯瘦的老頭子了,没有什麽美。那末你是個白白胖胖的小夥子，你可以脫了，褲子給人家看你的美咧。」鄉下人這時也湧上了氣來</p>

<p>— 澄</p>
<p>「我很快活、你們級裏有幾個同學的英文、實進步得很快、這我知道是你們努力的結果、所以、對於英文不甚好的同學、眞無須担憂、你們袛要努力些用功些好了、天下决没有難事的、也没有費了力而得不到酬報的、」敎英文的王先生站在講台的右邊很快活的說着、他是很年輕、很美麗並且聽說還没曾婚娶、我們很羨慕他、很敬佩他、爲了他的才貌、</p>
<p>他說完話、敎室内特别的靜寂、每個人都低下頭、很用心似的望着書本、坐在我左邊的琪、頭俯得比别的同學更低她的白白的臉上更泛起了一陣淡淡的紅雲、我那時知道先生所說、「英文進步得很快、」琪也是其中的一個、因爲她進步的很神速、最近、她幾乎可說是全級中英文最好的了、</p>
<p>隔了二星期、王先生在英作課時、出一個題目呌、「寫一封信給你的朋友、」先生寫完題目、帶着欣悅的微笑、回過頭來對琪望了一望、隨接說、「今天的題目很容易吧、」許多的同學、都高興似的接着說、「容易的以後最好多出類乎這種的題目、因爲他的範圍大、我們容易發揮思想、」先生笑着的臉、這時笑得似乎更高興、</p>
<p>兩天後、先生把我們的卷子己改完、於是發還給我們、同學們照例問「誰的英作最好」、他們都很望自己的英作進步、所以時時問英作最好的同學要來看、先生的態度似不像平時的從容、但不一會、他很從容的說了、「那次題目容易、差不多每個人都好、現在、我告訴你們、你們如望英文進步得快、應該對我敎的讀本注意外、對圖書館裏的那些英讀本、也應該多多的研究、你們有没有誰時常到圖書館裏去的、圖書館裏的書、是你們、也是我的、很好的敎師、散了課、你們應該去呵、」</p>
<p>英文課下課後、我們一課也没有了、於是很高的一個聲音「誰到圖書館裏去、去的快和我一同去、」很多的同學也高聲的回說着「去的、去的」隨接跳跳躍躍的走出了敎室、</p>
<p>先生的話似乎没有甚麽疑的可能、不過神經過敏的我、總覺得先生比平時有些兩樣、又坐在我左邊的琪、也使我覺着她有些特别、</p>
<p>平時、先生交還我們的英作簿、琪每次問我「你有幾分、」並且要求我把卷子調來看但這次她得了卷子、她打開了、很快的一望後、就把它合上了、放進桌子、默默的讀着讀本、</p>
<p>我見了她這個態度、猜疑她不是得了很好的分數、便是得了很不好的分數、但我思索了一會、又考察了她的神色、我想琪定不會得到很不好的分數的、因爲根本她這學期己進步好多了、在她没有進步以前、她的英作也在十數名以内的於是我又想她定得了很好的分數、、但一想又不對、前次的前次、在先生没有說出琪是最好以前、她己快樂地把她的卷子、放到我面前、笑說着、「九十八分、九十八分、」</p>
<p>整整的一課我現在猜想和好奇中　　英文課散後、一級的同學、都走出了敎室、除了我、琪、和離我最遠一行的兩個在寫情書的汪、和汪前面的張、</p>
<p>我察出琪有些特别、所以輕輕地問她要英作簿看、同時、我的英作簿、也交給了她、</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>「呵、没有甚麽好、不要調來看吧、琪的神色似乎在央求我、但我見了他臉上的淺笑、她的没法遮蔽的觀樂的笑後、我更覺好奇我更覺莫名其妙了、於是我繼續着、堅欲着她的英作簿、</p>
<p>「琪、老實對你說、今天的你、比别天很有些不同、你如有甚麽秘……有甚麽不歡喜給同學們知道的事、你儘給我知道好了、我定不說出來的、你不相信我知你最要好嗎「我在她耳朶邊輕輕的說、</p>
<p>「對於我、没有甚麽事不歡喜給同學們知道的、不過你知道同學們的嘴是常常閒空着、而且他們是素來善於形容的、如拿我和王先生的事給他們知道、對於王先生不是有很多不便嗎、」琨紅着臉低聲說、當她拿英作簿翻開了給我看、</p>
<p>「呵、好一封……」琪英作簿中、夾着王先生寫給琪的一封信開着的稱呼、寫着「我親愛的琪、」我一見了、不知不覺的高聲喊了出來、但立即住了口、當我知道我在高喊、</p>
<p>正、在寫情書的汪和張、回過頭望一望、問了一聲「甚麽事」後、仍沉入寫情書中了、</p>
<p>「證、我覺得眞莫名其妙、那天先生出了「寫一封信給你的朋友」、我自己糢糢糊糊的竟會作了這一封情書的文來那個討厭的王先生、也不知怎的竟會寫還我一封、「琪似喚非喚的說着、當我看着他們的情書、</p>
<p>「不、我想王先生也和你一樣糢糢糊糊的寫的、愛愈深時、寫時愈糢糊所以、總之是你們倆人的愛在作用吧了、你看、汪和張二人、糢糢糊糊的一些也不知我們在說些甚麽、爲了他們己糢糊地沉醉在他們的愛中了、」我指着汪和張說着、　　「你惡極、」琪笑着說當他在我的左肩上打了一下</p>

<p>— 从仌</p>
<p>麥琴萊先生（MrJPMcGinley）在愛爾蘭圖書館聯合會的一次會中說、「假使我有一個狄克推多底權力、我要把一大半書都抛到海裏去、爲圖書館選擇出來的書裏面有十分之九是代表英國人的心志和他們的趣味、行動以及道德底標準的、有聲電影和無線電也都對於我們愛爾蘭底敎育反對的、因爲牠們到我們愛爾蘭人隊裏來傳播他們英國的和美國的觀念、這些有聲電影和無線電都一定該拿來毁壞或監視才對、」於此可見愛爾蘭人的民族主義的精神是多麽澈底、在文藝方面、我們更可以明白這種情形鄧尼斯約翰斯冬（DenisJohnstone）的表現主義的劇本「老太太說不（ＴheＯleLadySays_No）己在（GateTkeatre）捲土重來了、而他的那篇「都柏林評論」和那位不能制止的、再接再厲的哥加德（ＯliverSt·JchnGogarty）寫在上面的抒情詩也在「意斯脫」（Ｅaster）公演了、那兩張俄國影片「亞洲風雲」和「彼德堡之末日」開映時去看的人也有六千之多、去年秋天孔雀戲院又開映過一張愛爾蘭「愛美的」的影片、夏芝先生的用新戲劇底形式的最近的試作「百葉窗上的字」也在AbbeyTheatre開演了、ＧateTheatre便以「回到麥修賽拉去」（ＢacktoMethuselah）一劇呌滿座來向AbbeyThetre報復而AbbeyTheatre）就以萊諾克斯、魯賓生（LennoxＲobinson)的「批評者」的摩登化的翻譯來回敬ＧateTheatre魯賓生爲了這「批評者」而得到去嘲弄都柏林的出版界、批評界和智識階級的機會、還有現任三清學院法文講師的桑、勃開脫（SamBeekett）先生也著了一本普羅斯脫（Proust)的研究、酒館街上近來又開了一爿極摩登的書店了、</p>
<p>刋物檢查局方面、對於愛爾蘭讀者的道德的幸福也非常出力、毫不倦怠、「新領袖」最近爲登了一張節制生育的廣告、己禁止發行了、愛爾逹斯·赫克斯萊（ＡldousHuxley）遜麥雷斯脫·馬恩（ＳomsrestMaugham)良姆·奥茀拉海逹（ＬiamＯFlaherty）和路易士·辛克萊等的小說也都被禁止了、因爲「他們在一班的趨勢上是猥褻的一、但在别的地方節制生育的書籍都得在檢查的烈光之下以自由登廣告、瑪麗·司托撥斯(MarieStopes）馬加雷·生格爾（MargaretSanger）甚而至於羅素都被目爲有傷風化的、只剩下愛林諾·格林（ElinerGlyn）、衣賽爾·代爾（ＥthelM·Ｄnll）和馬加雷比德生（MargaretＲeterson、來做這件好工作、</p>
<p>還有配持·奥唐納（ＰeaderODonell）最近把他的「小刀」（ＴheKnife)改了名字爲「將有一塲戰鬭」（ＴhereWillBeEighting）在美國出版了、奥唐納可算是最近十年來的愛爾蘭的最偉大的作家了、不過在都柏林的智識階級中還是比較不大有人知道、這大半是因爲他在「初夜」（ＦirstNights）「星期晚報」中不顯示他的個性的緣故、他們眞的只在「星期觀察報一别的人們說起來算好的英國評論上讀到他的書而己、但是那些在全世界發見裘哀司（Ｊoyce）十年後才知道裘哀司的人們、現在是不見得會知道奥唐納的、　　奥唐納己出了四本小說、裏面所寫的是農民生活和他們對於民族爭鬥的各方面的情形、「狂風大雨」（Ｓtorm）一書大槪十年前就出版了、現在己經絶板、在這本小說中就露出他有成功的希望、這書的頭幾章描寫唐納哥爾（Donegal）沿海的狂風大雨、寫得很美妙、只是除此以外、却没有什麽引人注意的地方、一九二五年他把另外一本小說的手稿給奥茀拉海逹看奥茀拉海逹看了一遍便用信封封好、寄給他自己的出版者約那生·開甫（JohnathanCapo）、不久「島民」（Jslander）便在英格蘭出版了、而批評界也都說這是一本描寫農民生活的傑作、後來這書改了名字爲「他們的常習（TheWayitＷaswithThem）又在美國出現、到一九二七年、他正在獻中、忽然德到亞持力哥爾（Adrigoolc）的塞立文（Sullivan)全家餓死的消息、一結果他就在狂怒與哀憐中寫出了他第三本小說一亞特力哥爾」、這本書直到現在還算是他最完美的作品、他第四本小說、「小刀」在技巧方面顯出極大時進步、然而奥唐納最好的作品現在還没有來呢、他現在不過三十五歲、雖然許多年來激烈的爭鬥、四十一天挨餓的罷工、和不停的革命底活動在他的驅體上留下了牠們的痕跡、然而他仍是活潑得驚人、他就要出的一本小說是和前四本拚起來成爲一組的最後一册、這書寫成後、他將從更大的觀念上來開始他的新作品了…一部和克魯泡持金的「法國革命史」的體相彷的「一八三○後之愛爾蘭史」、</p>
<p>現在奥唐納很自由、我的意思就是說他近一年來没有被警察捉去過、而且也不會有人知道、他目前竟住在都伯林城外的一個漂亮的宅區中、、是的、革命黨中的人竟去住在都柏林城外的紅房子中、誰都覺得不大可信的、</p>

<p>Wu's Brigade Bravely Resists the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Japanese Army Retreats to Tailai Town to Await Reinforcements</p>
<p>(Harbin) This morning at 5:00 AM, 700 Japanese infantry and artillery soldiers, along with a train of armored vehicles and over a hundred Mantetsu (South Manchuria Railway) workers, advanced along the Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway to forcibly build a bridge across the river. They ordered Wu's brigade of the Heilongjiang army to withdraw ten kilometers outside the railway line. Wu's brigade refused, stating they had not received orders from the authorities. The Japanese army immediately launched a fierce attack. Wu's brigade fought bravely, fiercely battling until 10:00 AM, when the Japanese army was defeated and retreated. At noon, three Japanese aircraft arrived to provide cover and assist in the attack, dropping many bombs. Wu's brigade suffered extremely heavy casualties, but their morale was very high. They resisted with all their might, and at noon finally repelled the Japanese army. The Japanese army retreated to Tailai Town, awaiting reinforcements for a counterattack. Tonight, two regiments of Japanese troops arrived in Taonan from the Gongzhuling area. The Heilongjiang cavalry's 1st brigade transported reinforcements to the river bridge over four days and nights to strengthen defenses. A fierce battle is expected tonight. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Heilongjiang merchants and civilians have formed an army support committee, raising 3,000 yuan to comfort the officers and soldiers defending against Zhang Haipeng. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bu Kui dispatch: Because the Japanese army has repeatedly instigated Zhang Haipeng to invade Jiangyuan, they forcefully ordered the Heilongjiang army to withdraw from the Nenjiang area. The Japanese consul stationed in Jiangyuan visited Ma Zhanshan yesterday, stating that the Japanese army would send workers to repair the Nenjiang railway bridge. If work is obstructed, they will take necessary measures. Ma Zhanshan sternly refused. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the morning of the 3rd, Honjo dispatched military officer Kimura to Heilongjiang to meet Ma Zhanshan, urgently delivering a letter demanding that the Jiang Bridge on the Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway be repaired by the 4th, and ordering the troops to withdraw ten kilometers outside the Jiang Bridge, prohibiting obstruction of the railway line and using the Jiang Bridge for tactical purposes. Ma has not yet replied. On the morning of the 4th, the Japanese army took military action. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to the Japanese newspaper in Harbin, the director of the Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway Bureau, Wan Guobin, has acknowledged the South Manchuria Railway Company's repair of the Nenjiang railway bridge, which is 178 kilometers long, and that the costs will be settled after the work is completed. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Zhang Haipeng's troops were threatened by the Japanese army and advanced north from Taonan to Tailai again on the 1st. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Five hundred Japanese soldiers departed from Taonan today to escort a road repair team to repair the Nenjiang bridge on the Taonan-Ang'angxi railway. It is said that this bridge was destroyed by the Heilongjiang provincial army to prevent Zhang Haipeng's troops from advancing. With the bridge destroyed, railway traffic is interrupted. An official spokesperson said that the decision to send troops to escort the road repair team was made after a long discussion, fearing foreign misunderstanding. Once repairs are completed, the Japanese soldiers will withdraw, which is expected to take ten to fourteen days. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Heilongjiang Provincial Government telegraphed on the 1st that Yoshihide Hayashi, acting on behalf of the Japanese Kwantung Command, stated that regardless of whether the Jiang Province can repair the Jiang Bridge, Mantetsu has decided to send workers to repair it on the 4th, and the Japanese army will provide cover. He also stated that the Japanese side is determined to change the political situation in the Jiang Province by force, regardless of the League of Nations' resolutions. Furthermore, according to the Japanese consul stationed in the Jiang Province, the previous deadline for repairing the bridge may not be agreed to by the Japanese government and the Kwantung Army Command. Japanese residents in the Jiang Province have decided to withdraw from Harbin on the 3rd to avoid the dangers of war, etc. Our side has repeatedly reasoned with them, but they claimed they have no authority to stop it. It has been investigated that the Japanese army threatened Zhang Haipeng to invade north of the railway, and our army demolished a section of the railway bridge on the Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway to prevent this. Subsequently, the Japanese side used the excuse that the railway had been lent to Japan and demanded repairs. This has been explained to the Japanese consul stationed in the Jiang Province, and orders have been given to the railway to repair it immediately. However, the Japanese army disregarded everything and hastily dispatched troops to provide cover for rushed repairs. Investigations reveal that the Jiang Bridge is only 160 li from the provincial capital. After repairs, it will only take two hours to drive straight into the province. The fact that the South Manchuria Railway is carrying out the repairs on their behalf undoubtedly indicates that they are using this as an excuse to advance troops or to provide cover for Zhang Haipeng's troops to attack the Jiang Provincial Capital. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Today, a public announcement was made here stating that on November 2nd, Japanese soldiers engaged in a fierce battle with a band of bandits near Changtu. The number of casualties is unknown. Officials admit that Japanese soldiers have occupied a section of the Tongliao-Taonan Railway to facilitate the repair of the Nenjiang railway bridge. It is rumored that Ma Zhanshan is determined to resist the Japanese soldiers' repair of the bridge by force. The newspapers in Harbin are currently full of rumors that a battle will break out south of Qiqihar. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The authorities denied tonight that the Japanese army had occupied Qiqihar, and said that the Japanese army did not want to advance to the north bank of the Nenjiang River. Sir John Tilley, the British Ambassador to Japan, made a verbal note to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, saying that he was under the orders of the British government to deny rumors that the British government was colluding with China to the detriment of Japan. The Foreign Ministry has announced this situation. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Wen Dianchen's Gang Indulges in Arson and Looting</p>
<p>Han Chinese Along the Railway Flee Empty-Handed</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the areas east and west of Liaoyuan County, there are over 2,000 bandits, led by Wen Dianchen, nicknamed "Six Harmonies." They frequently appear between the Yamentai, Sanlinbo, and Xuanshan stations along the Siping-Taonan Railway, engaging in arson, murder, and looting with extreme cruelty. Recently, they were supplied by the Japanese with over 700 large-caliber cannons, over 15,000 rounds of ammunition, five light machine guns, and three heavy machine guns. The Japanese army also dispatched Japanese and Korean ruffians, disguised and mixed among the bandits, instigating disturbances, intending to create a climate of terror along the Siping-Taonan Railway line, and driving out and killing Han Chinese. Therefore, near the Siping-Taonan Railway, Han Chinese households have fled completely empty-handed. The grain stored in the warehouses has all been transported to Zhengjiatun Station by the Japanese and Korean ruffians disguised as bandits, and all belongs to the Japanese. Wen is a Mongolian from the Darhan Banner, and the Japanese are colluding with him, ordering him to cause trouble, and then using this as an excuse to protect the Siping-Taonan Railway and implement their troop increase plan. How cunning the Japanese are, it is truly frightening. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) News from Shenyang says that a team of Japanese soldiers has been sent to Tongliao because Chinese soldiers have repeatedly attacked the Japanese engineering team repairing the road near Tongliao. Tongliao is the end station of the Zhengjiatun-Tongliao Railway, and the Zheng-Tong Railway is a branch line of the Siping-Zhengjiatun-Taonan Railway. It has always been managed by the Chinese, and was built with Japanese loans. There is one Japanese accountant, engineer, and traffic manager each, representing Japanese interests. Since the Japanese army occupied Shenyang on September 18, Japanese soldiers have gradually penetrated deeper. Going to Tongliao now means they have penetrated to the far west. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bu Kui dispatch: Honjo sent Kimura to Jiangyuan on the 2nd to meet Ma Zhanshan, stating that if the Chinese side cannot repair the Jiang Bridge by the 3rd of this month, the Japanese side will send fighter planes and armored vehicles to cover the South Manchuria Railway workers to carry out repairs. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Harbin Dispatch: (1) The Japanese troops who have arrived in Taonan one after another number about 3,000, mostly cavalry, followed by artillery, then infantry, and the fewest are engineers. Most of Zhang Haipeng's troops have already departed, with less than two battalions remaining in Taonan. (2) A train of Japanese armored vehicles arrived in Hargamiao on the 2nd. The Jiang Bridge on both banks has already been started to be repaired under the command of Japanese engineers, and is scheduled to be completed before the 15th. The Heilongjiang army has completely withdrawn to the east bank, and Xu's regiment of Zhang Haipeng's troops has advanced to the Wumiaozai area. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Harbin) This afternoon at 4:00 PM, five Japanese aircraft circled the Dazhao Station on the Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway, dropping more than twenty bombs, destroying the ticket office, the parking lot, and the telegraph room, killing and injuring over ten station staff. They flew away around 5:00 PM. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Puyi's Residence Guarded by Japanese Police</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Dohihara, carrying orders from the Japanese Army, arrived in Tianjin on the 2nd and resided in the Tokiwa Hotel. His missions were (1) to entice and coerce Puyi to go to Liaoning and organize an independent country; (2) to observe the anti-Japanese sentiments in Tianjin City and the attitudes of the consuls of various countries. On the 2nd, he was introduced to Puyi by the Japanese consul Goto, exchanged pleasantries for a moment, and then left. He visited again on the 3rd and immediately tried to persuade him to go to Liaoning. Puyi stated that after his abdication, he wished to be a commoner and had no other extravagant hopes. Dohihara saw that Puyi would not comply and said, "If you do not comply, I am afraid it will be detrimental to yourself." After speaking, he stormed off. Two armed Chinese police officers dispatched by the Japanese police station have been added to guard the main gate of Puyi's residence, prohibiting Puyi from receiving guests. Six Japanese soldiers are patrolling around the residence to prevent Puyi from escaping. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Puyi became the president of the People's Maintenance Association in Shenyang, he also convened a meeting of Mongolian princes and invited former Qing Dynasty officials, all as a prelude to restoration. Yuan Jinkai is very passive because he supports independence but does not support restoration. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese plot for the independence of the Northeast has not been realized for a long time due to (1) Heilongjiang Province not yet being captured, and the three provinces not being unified; (2) a lack of leading figures for the independent regime, leading to stalemate and undercurrents of competition. After much consideration, it is considered better to use Puyi, which is more straightforward. Xiqia, being a member of the imperial clan, has long supported it, and Zhang Haipeng has been persuaded by the Japanese. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Dohihara, the initiator of the Japanese military riot, secretly arrived in Tianjin on the 2nd, accompanied by Jin Liang. Dohihara and Jin visited Puyi for a secret two-hour talk. To avoid attention, Puyi's key aides met with Jin and Dohihara at a certain location on the afternoon of the 3rd. Although the content of the discussion is unknown, there is no doubt that the Japanese want to build a "bright and glorious" empire in the Northeast and invite Puyi to restore the throne.

<p>(Beiping) According to workers who escaped from the arsenal, the factory has over 400 workers. The Japanese do not allow them to leave the premises and are forcing them to dismantle machinery. After the machinery is transported away, many landmines are buried in various places inside the factory, preparing to destroy and bomb it when the Japanese army withdraws. (4th Dispatch)</p>

The Jilin Japanese military police department arrested Feng Zhanhai's mother-in-law, Mrs. Song, to force her to reveal the direction of Feng's regiment's retreat and to write a letter to summon Feng.

<p>Under Military Occupation and Oppression</p>
<p>Absolutely No Agreement to Begin Negotiations</p>
<p>The League of Nations and the United States Will Not Sit Idly By</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has just received a telegram from Representative Shi in Geneva, stating that he submitted a statement to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations on the 3rd and attached a report on the continued atrocities of the Japanese army. The main points of his statement are as follows:</p>
<p>"The Chinese government expresses serious concern regarding the development of the situation in the three northeastern provinces after the adjournment of the League of Nations Administrative Council. The attached memorandum proves that the scope of the Japanese military's actions in southern Manchuria has gradually expanded, its position has become increasingly consolidated, and it also has the intention of encroaching on northern Manchuria. It is recalled that the resolution of September 30 stated that the Japanese government 'will withdraw its troops, which are already in the process of withdrawing, within the shortest possible time.' However, this statement has not been fulfilled in reality. Not only has the Japanese army not begun to withdraw, but the Japanese government now refuses to fulfill its promise made at the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, and declares that it will never withdraw troops until China agrees to certain fundamental principles. At the same time, the Japanese government has again refused to fulfill the statement made by China and Japan in the resolution of September 30, and refuses to send representatives to begin discussing the detailed measures for the withdrawal of troops with Chinese representatives. Therefore, the attitude of the Japanese government violates Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant and Article 2 of the Paris Peace Pact. Therefore, the Chinese government must reiterate that the Chinese government, under the oppression of military occupation, absolutely does not agree to begin negotiations. At the same time, the Chinese government is convinced that all members of the League of Nations and the United States will not sit idly by and watch the League of Nations Covenant, the Peace Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty being completely destroyed."

<p>Japanese Army Encroaching on Qiqihar</p>
<p>Fear of Triggering a Sino-Soviet Conflict</p>
<p>(Geneva) News received here today states that the Japanese army is indeed seeking to occupy Qiqihar, the capital of Heilongjiang Province, and has sent infantry and artillery to protect Japanese engineers repairing the Nenjiang railway bridge. People in the League of Nations are very anxious upon hearing this news, fearing that this action will trigger a Sino-Soviet conflict and eventually involve Europe or even the United States, repeating the world war. Therefore, the League of Nations is paying more attention to the Manchurian issue than before. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Manchurian incident is rapidly advancing towards a dangerous situation. This is the general opinion in Geneva today, as new reports of Japanese military activities continue to pour into the League of Nations Secretariat. Although some members of the Administrative Council advocate holding an early meeting in Paris, this move has not yet been decided. The Administrative Council was originally scheduled to reconvene on November 16, but if China requests an early meeting, it may be possible to advance it. The League of Nations Secretariat is currently issuing a summary indicating that the Manchurian situation is becoming increasingly serious. What is described is based on the report of Dr. Shi Zhaoji, the Chief Chinese Representative. Dr. Shi actively provides League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond with various news of Sino-Japanese negotiations. Today, Dr. Shi submitted a document requesting the League of Nations and the United States to take full action to restrain Japanese militarism. Reports of Japanese soldiers advancing north and penetrating Qiqihar have caused unsettling feelings in Geneva today, because Japanese soldiers penetrating north of Changchun is an intrusion into the sphere of Russian interests. Later, a telegram from Tokyo denied this claim, stating that there was no intention to send troops north of the Nenjiang River. People were slightly relieved to hear this. Among the many telegrams at the League of Nations Secretariat, one thing is undoubtedly clear: the Manchurian situation has not improved and still has many dangerous possibilities. The hope that the Japanese army would completely withdraw before November 16 has gradually faded. When the Administrative Council reconvenes in the future, what it will have to deal with is truly the most difficult problem since the Manchurian incident endangered peace in the Far East. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat has received reports that the Japanese army has now penetrated into Qiqihar along the Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway. The League of Nations is currently discussing the implications of this report. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Chief Chinese Representative Shi Zhaoji delivered a note from the National Government to League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, stating that it has been more than a month since the Council passed its first resolution on September 30, and ten days since it passed its second resolution. The Japanese army has not only not withdrawn at all, but has gradually consolidated its occupied positions. The League of Nations Council and the United States should take actions to prevent the League of Nations Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact from being constantly trampled upon. (3rd National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Well-informed Japanese sources here claim that Japan and Soviet Russia will not clash in Manchuria, because it is firmly believed that there is an unwritten understanding between Moscow and Tokyo that both countries will not infringe upon each other's provinces with railway interests. According to recent speculation from various sources, the Sino-Japanese Manchurian dispute, judging from the developments of the past seven weeks, may involve Soviet Russia or other countries. The whole world is paying attention to this, and Washington is paying particular attention. However, officials at the State Department have not indicated whether the U.S. government is prepared to take further action immediately, nor have they commented on the possibility that the League of Nations Council may hold an early meeting.

<p>Refuting Japan's Reasons for Not Withdrawing Troops</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 3rd, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructed Ambassador to Japan Chiang Tso-pin to send a note to the Japanese government, refuting the reasons for not withdrawing troops. The full text of the note was formally released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday and is recorded below: "Regarding the matter of the note, the note received on October 31 has been read and understood. The resolution of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations on October 24, requesting the complete withdrawal of the Japanese troops occupying various parts of Northeast China before November 16, was unanimously supported by the thirteen member states of the Administrative Council. The Chinese government firmly believes that the government of your country will be able to respect the will of the highest organ maintaining world peace and implement the resolution. Moreover, the resolution of the Administrative Council on September 30 was fully accepted by your country. The League of Nations is therefore convinced that your country will immediately begin withdrawing troops and can announce its completion within two weeks. However, your country has not fulfilled this. Therefore, the Administrative Council reaffirmed the previous case on October 24 and set another deadline to achieve the purpose of restoring the original state. In accordance with the resolution of the Administrative Council, the government of this country invites the government of your country to appoint representatives to discuss the details of the withdrawal and takeover, and the final section of the note also states that the government of your country is willing to quickly begin discussing these details. I am pleased that the Chinese government has now appointed a takeover committee and has notified the government of your country. I still request that your country quickly send representatives to discuss the aforementioned details with the personnel appointed by this country and ensure the complete withdrawal of the troops occupying various places before November 16. As for what is stated in the note, the Japanese government's policy hopes to begin discussing the outline for establishing the basis of normal Sino-Japanese relations, the Chinese government is extremely willing to follow the recommendations of the Administrative Council and, after the troop withdrawal is completed, begin negotiations on the outstanding issues between the two countries and establish a mediation committee or similar permanent mechanism. However, before the troop withdrawal is completed, all discussions should be limited to the details of the troop withdrawal and takeover. The Chinese government's views on this matter have been communicated to the League of Nations on October 31 and are requested to be checked. This is to be noted." (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Japanese Government's Reply to Briand <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Slightly Changes Its Stance on Fundamental Principles</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Officials here indicated today the policy Japan will adopt at the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting. Regarding the point raised by French Foreign Minister Briand regarding the submission of treaty issues to arbitration, Japan will still demand that China recognize the validity of all treaties (including the Treaty of 1915). Japan's reply to Briand will be issued approximately tomorrow, explaining this request. When Briand commented on the fundamental principles proposed by Japan as the basis for resolving the Manchurian incident, he believed that since China was prepared to submit the treaty to the Hague Tribunal for arbitration, then Japan's fifth point...that is, respect for treaty rights...should be resolved. A Japanese spokesperson responded to this opinion, saying that the only event that legitimizes Japanese military action is Japan's perception of China's contempt for treaties. China's contempt for treaties has led to an extremely unsatisfactory situation that endangers Japan's position in Manchuria, and this position is inherently related to Japan's survival. This unsatisfactory situation ultimately triggered the current outbreak. Therefore, Japan cannot agree to restore the original state until China recognizes treaty restrictions. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) If the news conveyed by responsible parties tonight is indeed accurate, Japan has changed its position on the five fundamental principles. It is heard that although Japan still strongly insists that China should recognize its treaty restrictions, Japan's reply to Briand states that Japan is prepared to conduct troop withdrawal negotiations with China, and the negotiations on the five fundamental principles will proceed in tandem. According to what Japan previously advocated, China should first recognize the fundamental principles before Japan agrees to conduct troop withdrawal negotiations. Tokyo is now eagerly awaiting Nanjing's reaction to this change. Some quarters fear that it may not have any effect, because the Nanjing government firmly insists that troop withdrawal must precede negotiations. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) In its commentary today, the official Russian government newspaper pointed out that Japanese warlords are trying to fabricate a Red Terror in western Manchuria to justify their expansion of occupied areas. It also pointed out that Western governments, especially France, are eager to accept these absurd rumors in the hope of brewing a war against Russia. It also said that despite the Western and Eastern warmongers spreading baseless rumors in order to serve the selfish interests of various imperialists, they will eventually see themselves burned by the fire they ignited. Furthermore, the situation is very clear now. Japan is not only not withdrawing its troops, but wants to advance from southern Manchuria and occupy northern Manchuria. Japanese warlords have always used bandits and local disorder as excuses to justify their occupation of Chinese territory. Now that no one believes these arguments anymore, they are eager to find a new excuse to prolong their occupation period. Therefore, they created the claim that the Russian army is assisting Ma Zhanshan, and even hope to create a situation for war against Russia. After that, other imperialist countries can also reduce their opposition to Japan, etc. (4th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e26">Appeals for Peace Through Hunger Strike <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Northeast Incident, the people of our country have been alarmed by the imminent foreign threats and pained by the endless internal strife. The righteous indignation has been overwhelming. As a result, some have committed suicide by drowning, others have written blood letters by severing fingers. Recently, Wang Jixu, acting president of the Beiyang Institute of Technology in Tianjin, and Bao Enxian and Xue Baiyin, students of Zhenjiang Middle School, have begun hunger strikes out of grief and indignation, hoping to use their difficult actions and urgent appeals to prompt a final awakening from the authorities, so that peaceful unification can be achieved as soon as possible. Such enthusiasm for loving the country and such difficult and outstanding asceticism are truly enough to move Heaven and Earth and make ghosts and spirits weep. Their actions are worthy of respect, but their situation is even more worthy of sorrow. Alas, there are things that people abhor even more than death. Upon hearing this, what more can we say?</p>
<p>However, we still cannot help but express ourselves. Appeals through hunger strike are indeed painful and sincere, but such a passive and timid expression may not necessarily prompt the authorities to repent in reality. In terms of understanding, it is sufficient to prove that they have failed to recognize their own position and sacred power. Therefore, what is expressed in their consciousness is similar to "foolish loyalty," hoping to move Heaven's ears with sincerity. What is expressed in their behavior is close to "corpse remonstrance," exhausting their foolish loyalty and presenting corpses to remonstrate. Looking back on the past, it may not necessarily be possible to reverse "Heaven's will." Today, the feudal monarch's moral consciousness of loving the country and its people has been completely eradicated, while the individualistic egoistic concepts and desires for control are unbreakable. Years of internal warfare have left corpses strewn across thousands of miles. This year's floods have submerged vast areas. The Japanese disaster has suddenly erupted, causing shattered mountains and rivers, a withered people's livelihood, and a precarious national situation. All these facts are presented before our eyes. The misery and danger are enough to shock and deeply stimulate people ten thousand times more than the hunger strikes of a few individuals. However, the authorities seem indifferent to these facts. Then, how could the hunger strikes and weak appeals of a few people prompt them to awaken and arouse their automatic repentance? In a democratic country, the people are the foundation. Sovereignty rests with the people. If the government's measures are misguided, then the people should stand up and speak out loudly, using the public opinion of the masses to supervise the government's actions, so that they do not deviate from the interests of the masses. This is to be a responsible citizen, and this is to be a citizen who is capable of building a nation. Move the asceticism of hunger strikes and the sincerity of weeping and shedding tears to other legitimate and effective work. What cannot be accomplished? To have power but not exercise it, to have strength but not exert it, and to use timid actions to imitate the old ways of corpse remonstrance is, in our opinion, foolish and unacceptable. A Japanese named Bima (彼末) said at a meeting on the situation in Manchuria and Mongolia in Osaka on the 23rd of last month, "The Chinese have the strongest individuality, like a grain of sand. But when the Japanese form a nation, they are the strongest, just like cement." These words are most sufficient to prompt reflection among our people. The hunger strikes of Wang Jun and others are precisely the so-called strength of sand. However, a scattered foundation of sand cannot build tall buildings after all. Coagulate the scattered sand, unite firmly, and exert the strength of the sand, so that it becomes the strength of cement. In other words, we should use a positive spirit to awaken the people to form a strong unity, to jointly eliminate internal strife and jointly resist foreign aggression. The hunger strike of Wang Jun and others is no different from committing suicide by drowning, except for gaining a few faint sighs of sympathy from society and further diminishing the spirit of youth to strive for progress. What else is there? These facts are sufficient to make us sigh endlessly.</p>
<p>Here, we dare to directly tell the authorities: internal troubles with floods, external pressure from strong enemies, the wounds of the people's livelihood have not yet healed, the lost territory has not yet been recovered. The country is like a pile of eggs, and the people are suffering from displacement. What heart do people have left? They are still unable to sincerely trust each other and go to the national crisis together. Mr. Zhang Boling once used soccer to metaphorize politics, saying that the purpose of soccer is to kick the ball into the opponent's goal, but it is definitely not possible for one ball carrier to charge straight in with a sword and a horse. Kicking the ball in requires the entire team of players to pass the ball to each other and cooperate to advance, so that they can overcome resistance and enter the enemy's goal. The way to govern is just like this. Strength does not necessarily have to come from oneself, and success does not necessarily have to be achieved solely by oneself. This metaphor is most appropriate. The people's suffering is deep, and the people's hopes are earnest. Even if the current peaceful unification is a temporary situation of peace, the masses are still satisfied and it is better than nothing. The hunger strikes of those few individuals are not to be feared, but the universality of the psychology of resentment and choosing death over life among these few individuals is most to be feared. The people now all have this psychology. If the authorities do not wake up again, when will they?</p>

<h3 id="e36">Important Report by Chiang Kai-shek at the National Government Memorial Week <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Original Text, Sorted, Was Released Yesterday as a Supplement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central News Agency: Chairman Chiang delivered an important report at the National Government Memorial Week on the 2nd. The original transcript was not released because it was awaiting sorting and review. However, the foreign newspapers in Shanghai recently published excerpts, which omitted many important points and often distorted the original meaning. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow comrades, I have a few things to explain regarding the recent discussions between the representatives of the Central Government and Guangdong in Shanghai, which I will report on now. Yesterday, Shanghai newspapers published news saying they would thoroughly investigate the two telegrams issued by the Central News Agency regarding the reform proposal of the Guangdong party and government, and the Central Government's response. One telegram was sent by Tiecheng, instructed by the representatives sent to Shanghai by the Central Government. The other was the Central Government's reply, regarding the party and government reform proposal, which I signed and issued. Both original telegrams are on file. Yesterday's Shanghai newspapers mentioned investigating the source. Now, I can read these two original telegrams to you. The telegram from Shanghai arrived on October 28th. The original text is as follows: "Respectfully to Chairman Chiang, Secret: Before this morning's meeting, the Guangdong representatives proposed a party and government reform plan. Mr. Cai [Yuanpei] and others believe that this plan is of great importance, and the Central Government has not been informed in advance, making it inconvenient to discuss. The plan is hereby telegraphed for your consideration. (Note: The original text of the plan can be found in this newspaper on the 31st). Mr. Cai and others request instructions on how to respond. Please instruct us to follow." Tiecheng. Our telegram in response reads: "To Mayor Zhang of Shanghai, Secret, translated and forwarded to Mr. Li and Mr. Tiecheng. Tie brothers, I have read the telegram. Without discussing the content of the party and government reform proposal, its spirit is inconsistent with the call for unity against external aggression. At this time, for the sake of the party and the nation, the only option is to quickly gather in the capital and face the national crisis together. Fundamental issues of party and government should await the discussion and resolution of the majority of the party. There is no reason why a dozen people can decide on the overall plan for the entire party and nation by negotiating in the concessions. Since we are party members, we must abide by the party constitution together. As citizens, we should respond to the nation's crisis. If we are truly loyal comrades, loving the party and saving the country, and acting out of sincerity, rather than seeking to divide spoils as outsiders criticize, then such proposals that violate the party constitution and disregard the national crisis should not be proposed for discussion, so as not to betray the people's fervent hopes. This is our reply, Chiang Kai-shek." From the original text of this telegram, the truth of the matter is clear. There is no need for much explanation. Currently, the Central Government is extremely willing to unite sincerely and face external aggression together. All these trivial details have not been taken into account. They can publish and post whatever they want, and we have ignored it. However, yesterday's record seemed to say that the Central Government fabricated the telegram, and it was never released, so we have to prove the facts. The news published in Shanghai newspapers is almost entirely from the Guangdong side. The Central Government has remained silent throughout, hoping for the success of unity. We hope the National Kuomintang can understand this. However, there should be a clear understanding of what is published in the newspapers. Now that the nation is in crisis, there should be a judgment of right and wrong. We advocate respecting freedom of speech, but it is absolutely not permissible to overturn right and wrong and obliterate facts in the name of freedom of speech, causing public confusion and social unrest. Under such circumstances, the unity of the party will not only fail to help the party and external affairs, but will also increase the difficulties of diplomacy and push the country further into danger. As a result, the foundations of the country and the hearts of the people will be completely shaken. Is this the way to unite sincerely? If the representatives from Guangdong to Shanghai are uniting sincerely, with the sincerity to face the national crisis together, they would never disregard the shaking of people's hearts and the foundations of the country. As for the Central Government comrades, as long as this unity can be achieved as soon as possible, they can endure any grievances and pains. Therefore, we regard everything that has happened in the past as the past, and only seek to unite and fight against external aggression. However, when the Central Government seeks unity too eagerly, some people may think that the Central Government is in trouble, and everything must be subject to their control. It is as if the current Central Government has been conquered, and everything must accept the orders of Guangdong. Moreover, the Guangdong government has not conquered the Central Government. Even if it conquered the Central Government, what glory is there? Not to mention the Central Government, even if I, Chiang Kai-shek, personally succumb to the Guangdong comrades, is it not just party members succumbing to party members, senior friends succumbing to juniors, Chinese people succumbing to Chinese people? What victory or glory is there to speak of? Or perhaps some people think that the existence of the Guangdong government can restrain the Central Government, and shake the Central Government's diplomatic position. In principle, if the Guangdong representatives truly want to unite and fight against external aggression, for the sake of diplomacy, the Guangdong government should quickly and unconditionally abolish itself, in order to achieve national unity. It should not retain the form of the Guangdong government confronting the Central Government, otherwise it would be helping the Japanese to bully our country, which is not the true principle of uniting to save the country and the party. This is the first point that should be explained to everyone. Secondly, for the sake of eagerly hoping for unity, although we do not have to strictly talk about right and wrong, we should have a very honest attitude towards friends or enemies according to the principles of being human. We hope that friends will all be good people, and that even enemies can eventually become friends. Only with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of universal love can one be considered a follower of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Therefore, we should not let our friends, or even our enemies, do things that damage their character. The principles we rely on for revolution are: first, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrine and all his last instructions; second, the party constitution of our party; and third, the Provisional Constitution. If a friend comes to advise us that the party constitution can be compromised to comply with the wishes of a few people, this is something we cannot do. If someone says that the Provisional Constitution, although it represents the will of the people of the whole country, does not need to be observed, and we only need to comply with the words of a few Guangdong comrades, then this is also something we cannot do, as it would obliterate the public opinion of the people of the whole country, violate the Provisional Constitution established by the people of the whole country, and the party constitution established by all party members, listen to the instructions of a few people, and sacrifice the overall interests of the entire people and all party members. Since we are friends, why should we tell our friends to violate the public opinion of the people? A gentleman loves others with virtue. The reason why the affairs of the Chinese nation are not going well is mostly because of accommodating personal feelings and disregarding the great difficulties of the party and the country. In particular, when right and wrong are unclear, we must pay extra attention. Now that the nation is in crisis, we rely entirely on the guidance of the party's predecessors to lead us on a bright and righteous path. It is absolutely not good to force people to do things that violate the party and the country and sacrifice the public opinion of the entire country, or to use the opinions of a few people and local issues to shake the whole country, so that the central government has no way to handle diplomacy. I think the old comrades in Guangdong love the party and the country, and would never do such a thing. Someone may slander me, and I, Chiang Kai-shek, personally can endure it, but I absolutely cannot violate the laws and regulations of the party and the country, let down our people, or betray Dr. Sun Yat-sen. I have already made up my mind that even if all the people of the country and all the comrades are willing to violate the Provisional Constitution and the party constitution, I, Chiang Kai-shek, personally cannot destroy the Provisional Constitution or violate the party constitution. I hope that the senior comrades in Guangdong will take the attitude of revolutionary predecessors to guide us younger generations, so that we younger generations will not do things that betray the party and the country, violate the law and disrupt discipline, and create disasters for the next few decades. I have already told the Guangdong representatives in Shanghai that they are all predecessors, and I am a junior. If the predecessors teach us with good examples, then there is nothing we will not follow. If a bad seed is left today, I fear that it will forever be the sinner of the party and the country in the future. Therefore, as long as all the predecessors come up with a bright and upright attitude and method, all of us party members will definitely be willing to follow and walk on the bright and upright road. There will be no reason to oppose. I believe that no predecessor can call on us to violate the party constitution and destroy the Provisional Constitution. We cannot repeat the disastrous mistakes of the past twenty years. That kind of disaster has not stopped by the twentieth year of the Republic of China. Are we still willing to create another twenty years of disaster in the future? I think the old comrades should make our party members have a sense of respect, and not make our younger generations betray the party and violate the law, let alone make our younger generations lose respect and courtesy. If the younger generations are disrespectful and impolite to the predecessors, although the blame lies with the younger generations, the predecessor old comrades are also responsible. We very much hope that all the comrades in Shanghai have a deep understanding of this. Now is the time of national crisis. It is absolutely not effective for a few people to discuss day after day in Shanghai, and no major national plan can be discussed in the concessions, leaving the capital aside. When the Song ministers' discussions were not settled, the Jin soldiers had already crossed the river. If things come to this, the country will not exist, so what is the point of personal matters? At this time, as long as it is beneficial to the party and the country, everything about individuals is not a problem. Therefore, I gave them the telegram expressing my willingness to step down on the day the Guangdong comrades arrived in Shanghai, and I have already signed it and asked them to release it. However, they did not advocate releasing it at the time, but today they seem to think that I have broken my word, which is a pity. In fact, the draft prepared by Guangdong unilaterally for me without my consent was disclosed unofficially by the Guangdong side in newspapers in Guangzhou and Hong Kong in early October, so that newspapers in Tianjin and Beiping reprinted them one after another, causing unrest among the people of the whole country, thinking that I was about to resign and step down, causing complete unease among the society, the army, and the general public. The Guangdong comrades first disclosed their own draft, which was drafted by themselves but without my consent, everywhere, and on the other hand, the original draft signed and submitted by me on the day they arrived in Shanghai, said that it was not yet time to release it and put it aside, only making the people of the country panic and shake, and guessing about my departure and stay. If they truly love the party and the country, love the younger generations, and unite sincerely, I believe they would not intentionally play with us younger generations. Later, the Guangdong representatives sent another letter, saying that the intention of this telegram was not to abandon responsibility. This clearly wants me to continue to bear heavy responsibilities even on the verge of leaving, but after this telegram is sent, how can this responsibility be shouldered? It only makes the Chinese and foreign psychology unclear about where the central authority is entrusted, and no one is responsible for internal and external affairs, and the danger of the country is even more unspeakable. Therefore, I wrote to Mr. Cai and Mr. Zhang on the 30th of last month, saying that today the people are panicking and the dangers are even clearer. It is inappropriate to simply issue a telegram expressing our position. We must first appoint a legally responsible successor before issuing this telegram, and the day the telegram is issued should be the day I actually resign and relinquish responsibility. We must not leave any gaps to interrupt the country's politics. In this autumn of crisis and survival, we people have a heavy responsibility to the party and the country, and we must not deceive people and play games with national affairs, causing the country to fall into a state of anarchy. Therefore, I said that I can sacrifice anything personally, but I cannot destroy the country's laws and regulations, destroy the foundation of the government, or destroy the system of our party handed down by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Recently, someone mentioned that a comrade in Shanghai said that not only should Chiang step down, but also Chiang should go abroad and never be allowed to return to China. Some people even said that this was said by Mr. Hu [Shih]. I really don't believe it, because Mr. Hu has always been teaching us to love and protect us, and he has no prejudice. If I am wrong, he can clearly blame me, why say this? Even if he said this, it is just a casual joke, not something he really wants to say from the bottom of his heart. Therefore, I do not ask whether anyone said this. As for my personal position, as long as it is beneficial to the party and the country, I am willing to be expelled, even to die. If my resignation can make the party and the country healthier and diplomacy can be victorious, I am willing to die. If I did not have this determination to die, I would not be in Nanjing today. If I did not have the determination to sacrifice myself for the party, I would have been chased away by the conspiracy of the Communist Party, who sold short, bought empty, and fabricated rumors to slander me in the fifteenth and sixteenth years of the Republic of China. If I did not have the determination to sacrifice myself for the country in the face of danger, I could have been chased away by the Japanese artillery fire in Jinan in the fifteenth year. The methods of the Communist Party and the Japanese warlords are like this, but we comrades should always be close and sincere. Even if we do not show concern for friends and relieve their difficulties, we should leave some room for the sake of the country and the history of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Friends can only see sincerity in times of crisis, and revolution must also respect our duties and abide by the laws and regulations of the party and the country more and more in times of increasing crisis in order to be considered revolutionaries. Foreign friendly countries view the future of our China entirely on whether our central government and government comrades can fight to the end, and not be shaken by the changes in a part of Guangdong and the disputes of a few people in Guangdong, undermining the credibility of our central government in the international community. Perhaps the friendly countries know that when our central government is in this kind of internal and external attack, it can still fight to the end, be responsible and unremitting, and be worthy of being a friend in the international community, and will pay more attention to the Chinese character and help us complete the revolutionary cause. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to use a few local issues to restrain diplomacy, shake the country, and obliterate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's life, the party system, and the historical facts of the revolution. Therefore, I believe that the senior comrades in Guangdong would never have such intentions, and I believe that they will eventually love the party and the country, realize peace, come to the capital together, and face the national crisis together, and never let this unity break down again. I originally proposed three principles at the beginning of the contact with Guangdong, and I still abide by these three principles: First, if the Guangdong side can take full responsibility, then the comrades in the Central Government can make all concessions. Please move the comrades in Guangdong as a whole to the capital and reorganize the government. As for Chiang Kai-shek personally stepping down, there is no problem. As long as the Guangdong side can reliably take responsibility and come to take over, then Chiang Kai-shek can issue a telegram to step down. Second, if the Guangdong side cannot take responsibility, then it should be presided over by the Central Government, and the Guangdong government should be abolished. The Guangdong comrades should gather in the capital together to face the national crisis together. Third, if cooperation is desired from all parties, then Chiang Kai-shek welcomes it even more, but we must come to Beijing to discuss in person, which is the way to be open and honest and share the same boat. What we are taking now is the third path, but just sitting in Shanghai and discussing the party and government reform system without coming to the country's difficulties only makes the night long and dreamy, and makes people panic. Not only can it not reduce the central government's difficulties, but it also makes the party and the country more</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>increase the danger. This is not the purpose of uniting to fight against external aggression, but to accelerate the demise of the party and the country. I believe that the predecessors of our party would never lead us younger generations in this way. I sincerely hope that all the comrades in Shanghai will abide by the original intention of saving the party and the country and uniting to fight against external aggression, and quickly gather in the capital to face the national crisis together. I also hope that the general public, especially the journalists, will take national interests as the premise, distinguish right from wrong, and distinguish public from private. At this time of national life and death, if the people of the country do not have an accurate goal, then the country will inevitably perish and the race will inevitably be exterminated. Today, on the memorial week in front of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's portrait, I can declare to the government comrades that as long as Chiang Kai-shek has one breath left, he will sacrifice his personal interests to promote the unity of the party, realize peace and unification, and especially uphold the Provisional Constitution and abide by the party constitution to the end, in order to repay the party and the country and our deceased Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Other praise and slander, advantages and disadvantages, advancement and retreat, success and failure, are not enough to shake my determination. I hope that all comrades understand this intention. At this time of internal and external attack, we should abide by the law, fulfill our duties, take responsibility, work hard, and implement our long-standing advocacy of peace and unification, and be worthy of being followers of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Fortunately! (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Ministry of Foreign Affairs Officially Announces the Tao Peng Case Has Been Resolved <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Company Commander Huang Who Shot Tao Peng</p>
<p>Has Been Sentenced to Fourteen Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially announced on the 4th that the Tao Peng case has been resolved. The Tao Peng case, which caused a sensation in June of this year, has now been found to have been shot by Company Commander Huang Zhenwu, stationed in Suzhou. As a result of the military law trial, Huang has been sentenced to fourteen years of imprisonment. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note to the British ambassador and the summary of the investigation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note to the British Ambassador to China on October 20 states: Regarding the Tao Peng missing case, the Acting Minister recalls that in June, British consular officials conducted investigations in Kunshan and Suzhou based on rumors about the case. The results of the investigation and attachments have been sent to the Ministry. According to the attachments, it appears that Tao Peng was involved in a shooting incident near Kunshan on the night of June 1. On the morning of the 2nd, he was captured by military police and taken to Suzhou on the same day. In early July, representatives from the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ministry conducted investigations and did not obtain the same results as the British consular officials. On July 29, Your Excellency the Ambassador was instructed to present a note from Your Excellency's government to the President of our country, which the President immediately ordered Vice Minister Chen Ci of the Ministry of Military Affairs to investigate thoroughly. The Ministry also slightly mentioned the investigation on August 6. Vice Minister initially found it difficult to start the investigation due to a lack of direct evidence, so he had to be cautious, which prevented his work from ending as early as the government had hoped. By September 25, his investigation had yielded considerable results, and former Minister Wang had requested verification of the details of Tao Peng's causing trouble and being arrested, as well as the person in charge of the custody. The Acting Minister has now approved the detailed report sent by the Vice Minister to the Ministry. According to the report, it can be seen that the British government's concerns about Tao Peng's fate are indeed well-founded. After Tao Peng shot and killed two military policemen, he was arrested in Kunshan on June 2 and killed by Company Commander Huang Zhenwu in Suzhou on the 8th. The Chinese government cannot but inform Your Excellency the Ambassador of this and express deep regret. Moreover, Company Commander Huang wanted to conceal the truth of this case, even from the government itself, but now it is clear from the report, so the Chinese government cannot but express regret again. Recalling that the shooting incident near Kunshan occurred when the wind of agitation in the country was at its peak, and at that time, all the military police on the Jinghu Railway had been ordered to pay close attention to suspicious persons. Tao Peng was arrested and taken to Suzhou after the shooting incident, just under this circumstance. Moreover, Tao Peng's violent behavior and the strange objects found in his belongings, as well as his refusal to reveal his name and nationality, could not but arouse suspicion that he intended to engage in activities that endangered national security. However, due to this kind of fear and the inability to recognize who Tao Peng was at that time, he could not be handed over to British officials after his capture. Company Commander Huang has now been sentenced to fourteen years of imprisonment as a result of the military law trial, as stated in the report. The Chinese government has also circulated the verdict to all military officers to inform them. This is what the Acting Minister wishes to mention. As for the assistance of British officials in providing evidence to help clarify the incident, the Chinese government expresses its gratitude. In short, the Acting Minister wishes to reaffirm the Chinese government's determination to uphold the meaning of modern law and implement it in China, and the Chinese government hopes that the British government can believe that it is sincere in implementing this principle in the measures taken in this case. Accordingly, a copy of the original report is sent to Your Excellency the Ambassador for your information. It is necessary to inform you that this note is addressed to His Majesty's Ambassador to China, Sir Miles Lampson.</p>
<p>Summary of the Tao Peng Case Report: On the evening of June 1 of this year, three military policemen were patrolling the Jinghu Railway when they saw a suspicious person walking hurriedly on the railway tracks. They immediately issued a password to order him to stop, but he did not listen. So they went forward to check and found that he was a foreigner. Unexpectedly, the foreigner immediately opened fire and shot two military policemen to the ground. At that time, an express train passed by, and the foreigner escaped, leaving behind a bag containing a pistol, a handful of bullets, a small knife, a small bottle of chloroform, a paper mask, and other items. The foreigner was arrested the next day and taken to Suzhou. Company Commander Huang interrogated him, but the foreigner refused to tell him who he was. He only said that he came from Shanghai, had no passport, admitted that the bag belonged to him, and refused to tell the reason for shooting the military policemen. Company Commander Huang believed that the foreigner's behavior was suspicious and that he must be a foreign bandit, intending to send him to the court, but he planned to wait for the injured military policemen to recover and obtain their evidence before transferring him. On June 7, Company Commander Huang learned that one of the military policemen who had been shot had died from his injuries, and the other was also difficult to save (he also died later). So on the 8th, he interrogated the foreigner again. During the interrogation, the company commander was filled with righteous indignation, and the foreigner suddenly took advantage of the company commander's unpreparedness and pounced on him. The company commander drew his pistol and shot him, killing him. Company Commander Huang knew that his behavior was excessive, so he destroyed all the evidence along with the body and ordered all the soldiers not to leak the information. Therefore, the first investigation did not yield any results. Later, his subordinates revealed the truth, and Company Commander Huang was taken into custody and sent to the military law trial. It was found that the foreigner shot by Company Commander Huang was indeed the Englishman Tao Peng. As a result of the trial, he was sentenced to fourteen years of imprisonment.

<p>(Tianjin) A reporter took a train to Tanggu at 5:30 in the morning on the 4th. At 7:20, the Tencho Maru docked, and Zhang Zongchang was already standing on the deck. The reporter boarded the ship to interview him, exchanging a few words, and then went to the special train prepared on the Beining Road to talk in detail. Zhang's boldness and generosity were no less than in the past. He said, "The Japanese army's occupation of Liaoning and Jilin is extremely distressing. All citizens are indignant. People are trying to use me to harm the eastern provinces. How can I be fooled by them? However, there are many Japanese who came to surround me. I once told them that I am an outsider who does not ask about national affairs. I have no opinion on the Northeast Incident and will not express any opinion." The Japanese had no way to deal with me. However, I have long wanted to leave Dalian to avoid being used by the Japanese as a tool for spreading rumors. Although the Japanese cannot openly prevent me from acting, they also do not want me to leave. Recently, Deputy Commander Zhang sent a representative to invite me to Beiping. I then decided to leave Dalian to explain the misunderstanding. I am now a citizen, and it is inconvenient to express opinions on national affairs lightly, but the north has suffered such a heavy blow, and our citizens cannot ignore it and should think of a way. Some time ago, everyone hoped that the League of Nations would uphold justice and make fair sanctions. Now it seems like a mirage. In my personal opinion, the governing officials should not mention any grudges, abandon the idea of rights, cooperate fully, and adopt the opinions of the people. The whole country should be united, and then diplomacy will have strength and negotiations will have success. I hope that at this time of national survival, everyone will argue about opinions, fight for rights, and fail to cooperate with external affairs, then what will the future be like? I dare not say. I will stay in Tianjin for a day or two and then go to Beiping." Then he asked the reporter about the peace conference situation and was extremely concerned. Speaking of this, Zhang Liang's representative Wang Zhen, Zhang Xueming's representative Tao Weiduo, Gao Jiyi's representative Fu Qiang, Pan Fu's representative Yang Bin, Sun Dianying's representative Li Delu, and Lin Xianzhu, Jin Shouliang, Wang Dong, Ma Dunyuan, Gu Zhen, Liu Ziqing, Guo Zhen, Teng Jie, San Du Shang, Qiu Suzhen, Liang Jiheng, Li Baoshu, Liu Zhenbang, Shi Liuhua, Wang Shenzhi, Hao Mengjiu, Yin Shaochang, Wu Jiyu, Zhang Shaojiang, Gao Yiting, Han Yisan, Cheng Boke, Zhang Shiguang, Qian Mingyu, Zhou Zhicheng and other thirty people, took a special train from Tianjin and arrived in the morning to visit. Zhang's fifth wife also came to welcome him. Accompanying Zhang were Chief of Staff Li Boren, Secretary-General Xu Xiaolou, Medical Officer Tang Binru, and more than a dozen followers. At 8:30, he left Tanggu and arrived in Tianjin at 10:20. Zhang Xueming, Xu Wenguo, Wang Yimin, Dong Shien and other twenty people welcomed him at the East Station. After Zhang got out of the car and exchanged greetings, he was accompanied by Li Shiku and others to Jin Shouliang's residence to rest. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e63">Candidate for British New Cabinet's Chancellor of the Exchequer Undecided <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Baldwin Declines to Serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer</p>
<p>Austen Declares Unwillingness to Join the Cabinet</p>
<p>New Parliament Holds Its First Meeting the Other Day</p>
<p>Party Members Appoint New Leaders</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd - Who will fill the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer in the new cabinet? This is the question on everyone's lips. Prime Minister MacDonald has now gone to the birthplace of Lord Lothian for a short rest and will return on Sunday. It is generally thought that the formation of the cabinet is proving more difficult than initially anticipated. However, it is not unexpected that the list of cabinet members will be announced before the Prime Minister's return. The most closely watched position is that of Chancellor of the Exchequer. Conservative Party members of Parliament generally believe that Neville Chamberlain is best suited to manage finances, but MacDonald seems unwilling to appoint someone with such strong views on tariffs as Chamberlain to this position. Therefore, some Conservative Party members are gradually becoming resentful. MacDonald, considering Baldwin's more moderate views on tariffs, invited Baldwin to serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer, but Baldwin declined. Once the candidate for Chancellor of the Exchequer is announced, the tariff policies that MacDonald's new government intends to implement will be known. Austen Chamberlain, who previously served as Foreign Secretary in Baldwin's Conservative government and as First Lord of the Admiralty in the pre-election National Government, is now 68 years old. He has written to Conservative Party leader Baldwin, stating that he is unwilling to accept a cabinet position. At noon today, the new Parliament held its first meeting and elected FitzRoy as Speaker. Today, members of the National Liberal Party held a meeting and unanimously decided to appoint the renowned legal scholar Sir John Simon, the former leader of the Indian Constitutional Reform Commission, as their leader. Labour Party members also met today and unanimously elected Lansbury as the leader of the Labour Party members of Parliament. Lansbury is 71 years old and previously served as Minister of Works in the Labour cabinet. Labour Party members still trust Henderson and have asked him to remain as party leader. Although Henderson was defeated in this election, his parliamentary career will not be interrupted as he will eventually secure a seat.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - In British city elections, the Conservative Party has won almost everywhere. The Conservative Party has captured 338 seats from the Labour Party, and the Labour Party has lost a total of 416 seats.</p>

<p>National News, Washington, 3rd - Today, the idea of a major naval plan has resurfaced in the US capital. Bradon, Chairman of the House Naval Appropriations Committee, announced that after the new Congress convenes next month, he will propose an appropriation of $120 million US dollars for naval construction.

<p>Reuters, London, 4th - Dr. Wang, a member of the procurement committee of the Chinese government regarding the handling of the refunded Boxer Indemnity, has now departed for Italy. He will spend half a month in Italy negotiating with the Italian authorities for the purchase of Italian raw materials for disaster relief in China. This is because the Italian government is now refunding part of the Boxer Indemnity obtained by Italy to China, but this money must be used in Italy to purchase raw materials needed for disaster relief in China. The work of the procurement committee in England is progressing satisfactorily, but not quickly, as the technical aspects require some time. Dr. Shi Zhaoji, the Chinese Minister to the UK, is also a member of the procurement committee. However, Dr. Shi is currently staying in Geneva, awaiting instructions from the Chinese government regarding the Manchurian incident.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Zhang HaiPeng Invades Heilongjiang Again <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Recruits Bandits to Attack the Provincial Capital in Two Routes</p>
<p>Japanese Army Advances Toward the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Railway Under the Pretext of Repairing a Bridge</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The battles along the Tao'an-Ang'angxi railway line could have come to an end after Zhang HaiPeng's troops were routed. However, Zhang HaiPeng was unwilling to accept defeat after retreating to Tao'an, and deliberately intended to disturb Heilongjiang again. However, his troops were scattered and his strength was insufficient. Therefore, he tried his best to recruit bandits to replenish his forces. Even the workers of the Tao'an-Ang'angxi railway, who were captured during the retreat, were forcibly drafted into the army. He has now claimed to have one cavalry brigade and two infantry brigades. Zhang and his son, Zhiming, each command an infantry brigade. The cavalry brigade was expanded and reorganized from the original Second Regiment and is commanded by Jing Guofen, the former regimental commander. Guns and ammunition are supplied by the Japanese. On October 24, the Japanese army transported military supplies in four train cars from the Siping-Tao'an Railway to Tao'an, which were received by Zhang's troops. The Japanese also provided Zhang with 100,000 Japanese yen for military expenses to be used to recruit and pacify bandits. Currently, bandits in the seven counties and four banners within the Mongolian border are flocking to Zhang because of his wealth and promise of official positions. Zhang is recruiting both large and small bandit groups. As of now, he has recruited more than 2,700 bandits. However, while Zhang is recruiting bandits to expand his strength, he is also sending telegrams to Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, and others in Beiping, expressing remorse and falsely claiming that his previous entry into Heilongjiang with his troops was an unavoidable matter. He will close his doors to reflect on his mistakes, reside in Liaoning, hand over his troops to his son, Zhiming, and allow the Heilongjiang army to reorganize them. At the same time, Zhang also telegraphed Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang, saying that he would close his doors to reflect on his mistakes. The Heilongjiang provincial authorities thought that Zhang had sincerely repented and sent Wu Songshan's brigade to send officials to verify the reorganization of Zhang's troops nearby. However, before Wu's brigade could dispatch officials, Zhang suddenly sent someone to say that the roster of officers and soldiers had not yet been completed and requested that the verification be postponed. Ma Zhanshan was quite surprised by his evasion and sent Wang Jingxiu, the chief of staff of the National Defense Preparatory Office, to Tao'an to secretly investigate the movements of Zhang's troops. Wang returned to the province on the 28th and reported that Zhang HaiPeng was indeed still harboring ulterior motives and would invade Heilongjiang again. His plan is to launch the attack when the Nenjiang River freezes, so that he can cross the river on the ice without the need for boats. He will attack the capital of Heilongjiang in two routes. One route, led by Zhang and his son, Zhiming, will advance with two infantry brigades along the Tao'an-Ang'angxi railway line. The other route will be a separate detachment, led by cavalry brigade commander Jing Guofen, which will secretly cross the river towards Zhaodong and attack the flank of the provincial capital, and also use it to divide the Heilongjiang army's forces. After receiving the report, Ma Zhanshan actively made arrangements, ordering Su Bingwen, the commander of the Second Infantry Brigade, to temporarily remain in the provincial capital to assist in military affairs, and mobilized Su Bingwen's and Zhang Dianjiu's brigades to defend the Dongping area and block the defense of Zhaodong. He also sent a letter to Ding Chao, the commander of the Eastern Railway Protection Army, requesting him to assist with the defense. Ding ordered the 174th Regiment of the 26th Brigade, stationed at the Yimianpo station on the Harbin-Suifenhe line, to deploy two armored trains to the Ang'angxi-Mangou station section of the Harbin-Manzhouli line yesterday. If necessary, the entire 26th Brigade will be transferred to strengthen the force. It is observed that if this military operation is launched, the scope of the disturbance will be broad, and the battle will not be as easy to end as before. The Japanese are determined to help Zhang attack Heilongjiang, acting unilaterally. First, the Chinese Eastern Railway's Dumien Timber Company will provide White Russian firearms to disrupt the Eastern Railway line, which will divert the Heilongjiang army's forces. There are reports that the White Russian leader, Semenov, secretly arrived in Harbin a few days ago, and his old troops have mostly been ordered to concentrate at Boketu. The White Russians who recently invaded the Boketu forest area are those White Russians, who are said to have about 600 firearms. Heilongjiang must telegraph Cheng Zhiyuan's brigade in Manzhouli and send troops to suppress them quickly. Second, the Japanese army will directly attack Heilongjiang. On the 25th of this month, two Japanese military officers went to Heilongjiang to meet Ma Zhanshan, saying that they were under the orders of their commander, Honjo, to ask Ma to hand over the government and peacefully cede it to Zhang HaiPeng. Ma refused, and the two military officers left in a huff. On the same day, Shimizu, the Japanese consul in Heilongjiang, suddenly sent a note to the provincial government, stating that the Tao'an-Ang'angxi railway was built with loans from the South Manchuria Railway (SMR), and the current interruption of traffic is detrimental to the interests of the SMR. The SMR will send workers to repair the Jiangqiao bridge. The provincial government immediately replied, stating that only two of the Jiangqiao bridges on the Tao'an-Ang'angxi railway were destroyed, and the damage was minor. The railway bureau has been ordered to repair them as soon as possible. China's railways have sovereignty, and Chinese workers can repair them as well, so there is no need for others to interfere. After the reply, on the afternoon of the 28th, the Japanese consul suddenly sent a final ultimatum with strong language, stating in substance: "The Tao'an-Ang'angxi railway is a railway built with loans from the South Manchuria Railway and is of great importance to transportation and the economy. If it is allowed to remain in its current state, it is absolutely impossible for the Chinese side to repair the bridge on its own. Therefore, the South Manchuria Railway, which has a close relationship, has decided to send people to begin the repair work. It is hoped that the Jiang province army will not interfere and will provide appropriate protection. If the repair work is interfered with, the Japanese side will take appropriate measures." On the same night, the Japanese Second Division, together with the South Manchuria Railway's garrison, totaling about 1,000 troops, arrived in Tao'an by troop train and notified the railway bureau to inform the Heilongjiang province to order the troops stationed on the Tao'an-Ang'angxi line to temporarily withdraw from the railway line. The Heilongjiang authorities believe that this move by the Japanese army is intended to cover up Zhang HaiPeng's invasion of Heilongjiang and, in addition to telegraphing Beiping, are ordering the troops on the Tao'an-Ang'angxi railway to temporarily retreat when the Japanese army advances. Therefore, it is expected that Zhang HaiPeng's troops will attack Heilongjiang during the day. (October 30)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Japanese Troops Collude with Bandits to Invade Tongliao a Second Time <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Ordeal of Tongliao Refugees in the First Invasion</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beijing reports that since the first day of the month, Japanese troops, using aircraft and armored vehicles to shield Mongol bandits, have again bombarded the north and south railway stations of Tongliao (the North Station is a station on the Zheng-Bai branch of the Si-Tao Railway, and the South Station is a station on the Da-Tong branch of the Bei-Ning Railway) and the city with artillery and machine guns. A telegram has already been sent reporting this, making it clear that Japan is disregarding the League of Nations and expanding its military operations as much as possible. It is unknown what their ultimate aim is. This ordeal of Tongliao is now the second time it has occurred. On the 15th of last month, the Japanese troops carried out a major destruction there. However, due to inconvenient transportation and obstructed communication, the Beijing side only knew that Japanese aircraft had dropped many bombs there on that day, killing fourteen people, while the detailed situation was largely unknown to the outside world. Now, according to the accounts of those who fled Tongliao to escape the disaster, the course of this battle is worth recording, so it is specially recorded below: "Tongliao is close to Inner Mongolia. In places such as Da-Hao-Zi and Da-Lin stations, there have been large numbers of Mongol bandits gathering since the beginning. After the Japanese troops occupied Liaoning and Jilin, they considered Tongliao to be in a strategic location, connected to Si-Tao in the north, which could reach Heilongjiang, and bordering Bei-Ning in the south, which could directly reach the Shanhaiguan Pass. Furthermore, Rehe was to its southwest. If they did not take control of it early and cut off the connection between Heilongjiang and Rehe, their military operations would be affected. Therefore, they sent messengers to extensively instigate the Mongol bandits, promising to supply them with weapons and money to launch an attack on Tongliao. The Mongol bandit leader Bao Bao-chen and others were incited and recruited Mongol people, providing them with weapons and plotting a planned and organized attack, calling it the 'Zhonghe National Inner Mongolia Independence Army.' Their flag was blue with a red sun. On October 13th, a Japanese armored vehicle suddenly arrived at Tongliao North Station, carrying Japanese man named Hayata and Bao Bao-chen, among others. After getting off the vehicle, they went to the Chamber of Commerce to visit Magistrate Wang and others, saying that they were acting on the orders of the Japanese military commander to order the county to quickly plan for independence and to send people to Da-Lin Station to welcome the Mongol soldiers and jointly establish an independent government. Magistrate Wang sternly refused. The Japanese left in frustration. That evening, the Mongol bandits split into two groups and launched an attack. The northern route was the Mongol bandit cavalry, advancing along the county seat. The southern route was the Japanese armored vehicle, protecting the Mongol bandits' advance along the railway line. The Northeast Army's 40th Regiment was originally stationed in the city, but because they had been ordered not to resist, they retreated en masse to Tuo-Zi, an area about three miles south of the railway line. At dawn on the 14th, more than 500 Mongol bandits stormed the city. Seeing that the city gate was not closed and the garrison had withdrawn, they rushed into the city, burning civilian houses and shelling shops. Tianqing Company was the first to be hit. The fire illuminated the sky, and the sounds of killing shook the earth. The people wailed in pain, leading their children and supporting their wives. The scene was too horrible to witness. At this time, there were still police groups in the city who were motivated by righteous indignation to open fire and resist. Local gentry Zhang Zhong-ge and Wang Zhen-duo also led the merchant and civilian groups to resist to the death in the streets, resulting in extremely fierce street fighting. The 40th Regiment outside the city heard the gunfire in the city and rushed to help. The Mongol bandits' weapons were supplied by the Japanese and were very sophisticated, and there were Japanese officers directing them. As a result, Zhao En-shun, the commander of the 1st Company, was killed in action, and the situation was on the verge of collapse. Fortunately, Regiment Commander Wang Qi-feng and Police Chief Yang Xi-bin fought to the death. After about five hours of stalemate, more than 200 Mongol bandits were killed. Seeing that they could not hold out, they began to collapse and retreat. There was an old man named Zhang (his first name is unknown), who was originally a cart driver at Tongliao Station, but then abandoned that profession to become a bandit. He gathered more than 600 people, but because he lacked military supplies, his momentum was still small. The Japanese troops detected this and sent people to instigate him, urging him to disturb the Tao-Liao area, giving him 600 Mauser rifles, 600 sets of military uniforms, 200 rounds of ammunition per person, and 20 silver dollars, scheduling a date for him to attack. On the 14th, when the Mongol bandits had already been defeated, the Japanese troops recruited Zhang to start an uprising. On the morning of the 15th, several Japanese aircraft were covering the bandits who were about to advance. Unexpectedly, Zhang still had blood and spirit and refused to obey the Japanese command, turning against them. Although the Japanese aircraft dropped bombs at the station to cover the advance of the newly transferred Mongol soldiers, Zhang intercepted and attacked them from behind, and attacked them from the front and back with the garrison and police groups in the city. One Japanese aircraft was shot down, and many Mongol bandits were killed. More than 40 Japanese personnel were directing the attack, and a few were also injured or killed. The Japanese military's plan failed, and they gnashed their teeth at Zhang. On the 16th, a Japanese steel armored vehicle carrying 60 Japanese soldiers arrived in Tongliao, intending to retaliate. Upon hearing the news, Zhang dug dozens of deep pits, about four feet wide, on the railway tracks west of Tongliao.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The pits were covered with straw, and soil was spread over the straw, and the railway tracks were reinstalled. He led his troops to ambush in the nearby high sorghum fields. When the Japanese steel armored vehicle passed by, the front railcar passed safely. When the steel armored vehicle arrived, there was a loud crash, and it fell into the pit. Zhang then led his troops to rush out and loot the weapons from the vehicle, killing many Japanese soldiers. In the afternoon, the Japanese military sent a crane to lift the steel armored vehicle out and pursued Zhang. But Zhang had already led his troops far away, and the Japanese military could do nothing. This was the course of the first Japanese collusion with Mongol bandits to invade Tongliao. Now that they have come again, their desire for revenge is even greater. It is feared that the incident will escalate, and the city of Tongliao will suffer even more from the Japanese troops' ravages." (November 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Japanese Spread Rumors in Tianjin <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>So-called Information Bureau Releases Statement by Italian Consul</p>
<p>Italian Acting Consul Sends Letter to North China Star to Correct</p>
<p>A dispatch from Tianjin reports that since the Northeast Incident occurred, the Japanese in Tianjin secretly organized a so-called Information Bureau, which publishes all kinds of strange and absurd rumors in English every day that are unfavorable to China, and distributes them to consulates and foreign organizations to confuse the foreigners in Tianjin. The English newspaper "North China Star" in Tianjin did not make a judgment and published a statement by the Italian Consul in Shenyang released by the bureau on the 30th. After seeing the newspaper, the Italian Acting Consul immediately sent a letter to correct it, and stated that the Italian Consul had never issued any statement. This shows the ugly state of the Japanese spreading rumors. The news report and the Italian Acting Consul's correction letter are translated as follows:</p>
<p>On the 30th of last month, the English newspaper "North China Star" in Tianjin published a telegram from the Japanese Information Bureau in Shenyang on the 29th, saying that the Italian Consul in Tianjin had recently traveled to Shenyang and made the following statement to a British reporter stationed in Shenyang: "It is almost impossible to demand that the Japanese troops withdraw to their original positions. It is not appropriate to withdraw troops until peace and order are restored in the northeastern provinces of China. In my personal opinion, the current situation will continue for a considerable period of time, but in the end, China and Japan can hope to reach a compromise. I also believe that similar autonomous governments will inevitably appear in certain parts of China, independent from Nanjing and other Manchurian provinces. Discussing the restoration of the Qing Dynasty in the current environment is almost completely useless." The Italian Acting Consul Jia Fu-te wrote a letter saying: "Dear reporter, today's newspaper published a piece of news with the headline 'Italian Consul General Says Withdrawal of Troops is Almost Impossible.' I am ordered to write to your newspaper to correct it. The Italian Consul stationed in Tianjin recently went to Shenyang due to special events, and did not meet with reporters, nor did he issue any statement to anyone. Please publish this letter in your newspaper. Thank you. Italian Acting Consul Jia Fu-te, October 31, 1931, in Tianjin."</p>
<h3 id="e75">Inspection Notes from Shenyang <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Shenyang reports that since the Japanese military forcibly occupied Shenyang, they have arbitrarily destroyed everything in our country. Regarding military deployments, Japan is actively expanding. I recently went to Shenyang again to investigate and saw the tragic situation in the city. I am truly filled with a sense of the past and present. I will record in detail what I heard and saw in Shenyang to inform those who care about Shenyang.</p>
<p>The section of the Bei-Ning Railway from Ju-Liu-He to Huang-Gu-Tun has long been under the violent control of the Japanese military. All passengers traveling to and from must undergo strict inspections and interrogations. Once the eastbound train passes Xin-Min Station, all passengers are uneasy, their faces filled with worry, and they say to each other, "We are about to pass the mountain of knives, we must be careful." Everyone rummages through their suitcases and boxes, checking themselves, and throwing any business cards or envelopes with titles out the window, because if they are found by the Japanese military, their lives will be in danger. When the train arrives at Ju-Liu-He, four or five Japanese military policemen, accompanied by one Chinese and one Japanese ruffian, board the train to inspect and search. Those with small courage see the fierce appearance of the ruffians and reveal a little bit of panic. If they are unfortunately seen by them, they will be ordered to take off their clothes for inspection, regardless of gender, and they will be endlessly questioned about their whereabouts. I personally saw six passengers on the same train being detained and taken off the train, one of whom was a female who looked like a student because she had a picture of her deceased father in military uniform, and the servant who accompanied me, named Shi Yao-cai, was also among them. In this serious environment, I could only watch them being dragged off the train, unable to help, but my heart was filled with anger, as if it were being fried in oil. After a day and a night, Shi was fortunately released. According to him, he was detained in the Tian-Tai Inn in Huang-Gu-Tun, and the Japanese soldiers pointed guns at him from time to time, forcing him to report on the deployment of our army along the Yu-Guan and Jin-Xian lines, treating him like a spy. Fortunately, he benefited from the calluses on his palms and was released yesterday to do hard labor, otherwise he would have been finished. However, when Shi left the inn, the other five people who had been detained on the same train were still being severely interrogated, and their fate was unknown. According to railway officials, passengers are detained on every passenger train. Because the railway bureau is under the oppressive power of the Japanese military, it cannot guarantee the safety of passengers.</p>
<p>Xin-Min County (100 li from Shenyang) As a result of negotiations with the railway bureau, the Japanese side has agreed to allow our armed railway police to be stationed to protect the railway and the armored trains will only go there. Except for the Japanese consulate, which has about a dozen Japanese soldiers, the county streets have become a free zone without any sign of soldiers or police. Therefore, bandits take the opportunity to rise up and openly plunder. Because the area is a buffer zone between the Chinese and Japanese troops, the Japanese artillery is stationed in Ju-Liu-He and is transferred back and forth to Shenyang every day, so the number of people increases and decreases. There are about one company. About 200 meters behind the station, dozens of newly built wooden barracks (about eight or nine of them have been completed). The rest are still under construction. Seven large-caliber heavy artillery pieces are erected next to the station. Two civilian boats and three small boats are moored on the west bank of Ju-Liu-He for the Japanese military to cross the river. The houses of the people on the shore by the railway have been occupied by the military. A cannon position has been set up on Nanshan on the east bank, the number is unknown, with electrical wires and sandbags installed. More than a dozen Japanese soldiers are digging semi-circular trenches on the north side. Further east to Ma-San-Jia, a company of Japanese cavalry is stationed, all living in Meng's shop.</p>
<p>Because of the prevalence of bandits in Huang-Gu-Tun, the Japanese military is on high alert near the station. Sandbags are piled up at intersections and pedestrians are occasionally searched, baring their chests to the cold wind, allowing them to search, which is very distressing. In the city and commercial port areas, merchants are still as before, only opening their doors and not lowering the window panels, and the business of food and groceries is still sufficient to maintain their expenses. As for foreign goods and consumable goods merchants, they spend their days idle, and no one consults them, and they all look up to the roof and sigh. If the current situation continues, I am afraid that by the end of the year, the entire city's commerce will inevitably come to an end. There are few pedestrians on the streets, and most of them are wearing white cloths on their arms. The desolate scene is unbearable to witness. After entering the city, I visited various friends, but most of them knocked on the doors ten times and no one opened them. Even those who had people watching at home were all panicked, as if a great disaster was about to befall them, making foreign travelers feel that they could not stay for a day. The most disturbing thing is that gunfire is heard everywhere at night. Currently, bandit robberies have spread from outside the city to inside the city and commercial port areas. In quiet streets and alleys, there are robberies after 4 or 5 pm. The Japanese military, in addition to closing the city gates early, has no other way to deal with it. The self-defense police, because they are ordered by the Japanese to return to the bureau in the evening, are not responsible for security, and the lives and property of the people are no longer guaranteed, so they are even more panicked than before. Until recently, foreign nationals from various countries have also moved out because they cannot live in peace, but the Japanese nationals have taken horse-drawn carriages to visit the city, and some have moved their families to the city, as a prelude to future co-residence. The Japanese flag flies everywhere in the city, and our blue and white national emblem can only be seen occasionally on the hats of the self-defense police, which is very sad. As for the brothels in the north and south markets and industrial areas, although they are sparsely visited, the Japanese side, in order to maintain the market, restricts them from leaving the area and strictly prohibits them. Those prostitutes who have no debts have already left the brothel, and those who remain in Shenyang are all poor and helpless creatures. Gambling dens and opium dens are everywhere in the northwest market and other places, and no one interferes with them. They can act freely and openly. The Japanese not only do not ban them, but also encourage them, their purpose being to expose the various shortcomings of the Chinese and make everyone addicted and unable to wake up, committing suicide. Their poisonous intentions are meticulous. On one hand, they send people to various important people's residences to search for weapons, and on the other hand, they force the people to hand them over, so the weapons of the Chinese are now all confiscated.</p>
<p>The strength of the bandits along the Ning-Lu Railway is unprecedented. When I went to Shenyang, about 13 li from Xin-Min, I saw several hundred bandits with complete weapons and horses, all dressed in short clothes, gathering in a willow forest more than a hundred paces from the railway. Fortunately, they did not harm the eastbound passenger train. The bandits erected a red flag with white characters on it, but because the road was far away, it was blurred and indistinguishable. Our military police were helpless because they were within the sphere of influence of the Japanese, and could only allow them to run rampant, and the travelers to and from suffered.</p>
<p>The Japanese military in Shenyang is extremely strict in censoring the newspapers of Tianjin and Beijing (also in Shanghai). Those who are found to be selling newspapers will be arrested. Those who are slightly guilty will be beaten and detained, and those who are seriously guilty will be killed with刺刀. Therefore, the residents of Shenyang are completely isolated from the outside world. The Japanese military police search for the Tianjin "Yi-Shi Daily" and "Ta-Kung-Pao" every day, and arrested the newspaper deliveryman of the Northeast Bookstore outside Xiaoxi Gate. The manager Shao Shang-wen was fortunate to have heard the news in advance and escaped, avoiding being killed. Many Chinese detectives are hired on the streets to侦察 the actions of newspaper vendors and passersby. The strictness of their surveillance can be imagined. However, the Japanese "Shun-Jing Times," "Manchuria Tai-Dong," and other newspapers can be sold freely and unhindered in western Liaoning, and no one resists them. The generosity of our compatriots is also very great.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the declining market, the Japanese side forcibly forces all entertainment venues to operate as usual. The people are worried and have no heart to be entertained. Therefore, theaters and theaters such as "Hui-Xian," "Da-Guan-Yuan," "Zhong-Shan," and "Gong-Yi" have been opened once, but because no one patronizes them, they cannot afford to lose money and have been suspended. Only tea houses and ballad books such as "Gong-Yu Hong-Tai-Xuan" can barely make a living because of their limited expenses. The hardship of these people is that they cannot quit because the Japanese side has imposed strict restrictions. They have the unspeakable suffering of a mute eating bitter melon.</p>
<p>The most active in the current political situation is Zhao Xin-bo, who holds the positions of Mayor of Shenyang, President of the Supreme Court, and President of the "Dong-San-Sheng Min-Bao" and "Xin-Min Evening News." Recently, he has also sought to replace the Chief of the Self-Defense Police Bureau. He holds several pseudo-positions and is the only favorite of the Japanese side. As for Yuan Jin-kai and Kan Chao-xi, they are not only puppets of the Japanese, but also Zhao's followers. They all want to take this opportunity to satisfy their official ambitions.</p>
<p>Regarding the so-called independence movement, the Japanese side is indeed actively instigating it. Their method is purely to use the shield of the enemy to attack the enemy. They first use the Chinese to take over various agencies, and the Japanese then insert themselves everywhere in the name of supervision, but in reality, they hold the power and control everything. Our crazy people are plotting to seize power and enter the political arena. Now that they have this opportunity, how can they not be used by others? It is rumored that the Japanese plan to secretly manipulate the establishment of the so-called new regime after the organization of various agencies is completed. The administrative power in name has been returned to China, adopting the old trick of destroying Korea. Currently, various political agencies in Shenyang have largely begun to work, and those that are less important are also actively proceeding. There are many who are coveting them. The people of the country should pay close attention to this situation. (October 28th)</p>

<p>Shi-Niu-Tuan villagers were shot and injured by bandits. Qian Rong-tao, a farmer in Shi-Niu-Tuan, west of Qian-Jia-Qiao, in the fifth district of this county, is very poor and lives by farming. On the night of the 23rd of last month, five thugs suddenly came to the area, each holding guns and sticks. They dragged Qian Rong-tao from his bed and shot him, the bullet wounding his left eye. He fainted and fell to the ground. The bandits, seeing that they had succeeded, fled far away. Fortunately, the injury was not too serious and did not cause great harm. However, according to Qian's confession, he did not know any of the five bandits and had no enemies in the past. He really did not understand what their purpose was. His relatives and neighbors were also surprised. In addition to the county government sending police to limit the investigation, Qian himself has gone to Shanghai to seek medical treatment.</p>

<p>The Party Department mediates disputes among TCM organizations. In the county's TCM community, there are two organizations: the National Medicine Association and the TCM Association. According to regulations, only one organization is allowed to be organized in one place. However, the National Medicine Association has been approved by the County Party Department and recognized as a legitimate organization, while the TCM Association was initially delayed due to unclear organizational procedures. The general members were deeply resentful and once attacked each other. The local Party Department convened both parties for mediation, but it was difficult to reach an agreement. Yesterday, the Training Department of the Provincial Party Department sent a staff member, Mr. Wu, to Songjiang to work with the County Party Department to conduct reconciliation. Representatives from both parties, Zhu Wen-qing, Jiang An-ren, and others, discussed peace terms. It is rumored that the TCM Association will be reorganized, with members of the National Medicine Association as the initiators responsible for the preparations, to be completed within 20 days. The TCM organization dispute, which has lasted for more than a year, has come to an end.</p>

<p>The murderer who assassinated Zhao has appealed to the court. Zhao Tie-qiao, the director of the Shanghai China Merchants Bureau, was assassinated at 8:00 a.m. on July 24th last year. Xia Shao-jin and Wang Jin-shan were captured by the Shanghai Municipal and County Public Security Bureaus one after another and sent to the Shanghai District Court for handling. The trial was concluded on June 25th of this year, and each was sentenced to death for premeditated murder. Xia and Wang refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court. Yesterday (the 4th) at 2:00 p.m., Judge Hu of the Third Criminal Court opened the trial. The wife of the deceased, Zhao Wang-shi, was entrusted to attend the court by Deng Shu-kai, Zhao Tie-qiao's brother-in-law. Xia Shao-en and Wang Jin-shan both denied killing Zhao Tie-qiao. Deng Shu-kai testified that when Zhao Tie-qiao was shot, he was sent to the Bao-Long Hospital for treatment and said the phrase "Why make a fuss about nothing?" There were no other last words. After Judge Hu's testimony, he ordered a postponement of the trial because further investigation was needed. Xia and Wang were returned to custody.</p>

<p>The principal of Yan-Xiang Elementary School died suddenly. There is an elementary school in Yan-Xiang, this county, which is a classroom, and there is only one teacher who handles all kinds of chores. The principal of the school, Hu Yan-lian, is a woman, 30 years old. Because her parents died early, she has not yet married. After graduating from Hu Ying-Hua Girls' School, she successively served as a teacher in various schools in this county. She only took the position of principal of the school this autumn. She is diligent in her duties on weekdays. On the 31st of last month, the children of the school went to school as usual, but did not see Principal Hu. It was not until 12:00 that the students returned home. The same thing happened the next day. The families of the students became suspicious and asked someone to go to the city to inquire at her uncle's house. According to him, he did not know either. He returned to the village to inspect the school, but Hu was sleeping on the floor. Therefore, the people of the village were quite surprised, because Hu was usually healthy and would not die suddenly. There were obviously suspicious points among them. Then her uncle, together with the dead person's cousin, Hu Tian-pu, went to the village to inspect. Unexpectedly, all the ornaments and various clothes in the dead person's clothing box were missing. The most bizarre thing was that four men's robes were found at the bottom of the box, so there were more doubts. At that time, because the body had been dead for a long time, they held a small funeral on the one hand, and Hu Tian-pu sent a petition to the county government and the Education Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>Counter-revolutionary criminals must not be sent to the Rehabilitation Institute hastily. Lin Biao, President of the Jiangsu Higher Court, said that after the opening of the Jiangsu Anti-Rebellion Institute, the prisons in various counties often requested that the counter-revolutionary criminals currently in custody be sent to the institute for rehabilitation without following the regulations of the Rehabilitation Institute, which was not in accordance with the regulations. Afterwards, all counter-revolutionary criminals who have committed ordinary crimes under investigation or trial cannot be sent to rehabilitation hastily. Even if the ordinary criminal case is concluded and the judgment is finalized, it should also be waited until the sentence of the ordinary criminal case is executed before the crime of counter-revolution is merged and executed. The county magistrate of this county, Chen Chuan-de, received this instruction yesterday (the 4th) and will comply with it.</p>
<p>A major fire in the Shen-Xin Spinning Factory. Shen-Xin Factory No. 3 of Xiao-Mu-Qiao, outside the west gate, was founded by the brothers Rong Zong-jing, who are giant merchants in this county.

Suddenly, thick smoke filled the air, spewing through the roof. After the stack officer Jia Shi-pei noticed, he immediately sounded the alarm. After hearing the alarm, the fire brigades rushed to the scene to draw water for firefighting. After an hour, it was extinguished. It is estimated that seven houses were burned down, about 2,000 dan of lint cotton and seedless cotton, and 46 pieces of package paper (each piece is valued at 100 yuan).

<h3 id="e87">Huang Kangtun Discusses Overseas Chinese Education in Southeast Asia <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Kangtun, who has taught abroad for many years, recently returned from Southeast Asia. A reporter visited him at his residence and saw a flower basket on his table, dazzling like precious jade, containing coral rocks produced in the seas of Singapore. Mr. Huang taught at Penang Middle School for three years and Yangon Middle School for two years. He spoke in detail about the situation of the overseas Chinese communities in the British Straits Settlements and Burma. The reporter, considering the relevance of overseas Chinese education, arranged the following interview:</p>
<p>(Question) What is the current situation and effect of the prevalence of overseas Chinese schools? (Answer) The current situation of overseas Chinese schools cannot be fully described in a few words. In general, they are struggling in the recent economic downturn. One can say, "It is dark before dawn." The history of overseas Chinese schools is not long, with the oldest being no more than thirty years. After the dynastic change, they sprang up like mushrooms after rain. Mandarin Chinese is now commonly spoken in overseas Chinese communities in Singapore, Penang, and other ports. In recent years, the anti-Japanese movement's slogans, though not as loudly proclaimed or widely posted as in China, are more consistently and thoroughly boycotted than in China. The recent robbery in the Eastern Provinces and the expression of hot indignation and sorrow are particularly profound. These few points show that the latent growth of overseas Chinese education is an effect that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the degree of development of overseas Chinese secondary education? (Answer) Overseas Chinese primary schools are quite developed in various parts of Southeast Asia. Even in remote mountain and coastal villages, wherever there are dozens of Chinese shops, one can hear the "Three Principles of the People" anthem. However, secondary education, apart from the Chinese High School in Singapore, which has senior high school classes, only reaches the junior high school level in other cities. The scale, facilities, and student numbers are not as spacious and complete as the equivalent schools established by the British. However, they are more prominent than the various overseas Chinese primary schools. Taking the two middle schools where I (Mr. Huang) served, Penang and Yangon, the Penang school, although small, is full of vitality, and student development has reached capacity, making expansion necessary. The Yangon school is large in scale but lacks vitality, with few students. Recently, it has been temporarily suspended due to various problems. The biggest reason for the success or failure of these two schools is the geographical location of Penang, which attracts students from various foreign ports. Students come from as far north as Siam and Burma, as far south as Kuala Lumpur and other small towns in the Malay Peninsula, and as far west as Sumatra. Therefore, student development is strong, and the school foundation is easily consolidated. Although Yangon is the capital of Burma and has the only middle school for the 300,000 overseas Chinese in Burma, the number of students in Chinese schools in each town is not very large, making it difficult for middle school graduates to develop. However, given the school's location and the dilapidated state of its buildings, it may be possible to convert it into an overseas Chinese public school, from kindergarten to co-educational primary school, merging the existing Chinese schools in Yangon that are currently too small. Then, gradually restoring it would be a great prospect.</p>
<p>(Question) Given the large number of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, their strong financial resources, and the considerable history of running their own schools, why has no university been established? (Answer) From the perspective of the actual needs of the number of overseas Chinese and their social culture, it is necessary to build a university. Economically, it is also possible to establish one. For example, the University of Yangon in Burma and Raffles University in Singapore, though established by the British, have received substantial donations from the overseas Chinese community. The reason why they are willing to help others but hesitant to build their own is that, firstly, there is a lack of qualified personnel with a strong reputation in China to call for overseas Chinese participation. Secondly, wealthy overseas Chinese who have lived abroad for a long time tend to admire Western education, sending their children to English schools from a young age and then studying in England and America to gain local recognition. Those who admire their motherland often send their children to study in China after graduating from primary school, lacking confidence in the local Chinese secondary schools. Thirdly, prominent and wealthy individuals in the overseas Chinese community often pursue different paths, lacking the spirit of cooperation and strong organizational skills. Therefore, there is no initiative to automatically establish a higher education institution. In fact, university education should be adapted to local conditions. The number of Caucasians in Southeast Asia is only a fraction of the total population, yet the construction of higher education is progressing rapidly, and students of all races, including Chinese, Malay, and Indian, are enrolled. However, Caucasians themselves are often unwilling to let their children study with people of color from the colonies. We are simply neglecting our own fields and cultivating others' fields, which is regrettable.</p>

<p>There were two important friendly soccer matches yesterday afternoon. The results were: (1) Jinan University defeated the British Army Northumberland, 4-1; (2) Donghua defeated Jiaotong University, 4-2 at Jiaoda.</p>
<p>Northumberland Submits to a Worthy Opponent</p>
<p>- Little Black Coal Scores Three Goals Alone -</p>
<p>The British Army Northumberland football team, known for its ferocity, was unexpectedly defeated by Jinan University. The Jinan players are commendable. Little Black Coal Chen Zhenhe bravely led the army and scored three goals alone. Qiu Dongyan also scored one goal. Northumberland was at its peak in the first half, leading 3-1. In the second half, Jinan bravely counterattacked, scoring three consecutive goals to win 4-3. There were slight differences in the lineups of both sides. Luo Haiguang did not play yesterday. Black Coal bravely took the center forward position, and Zhuang Shihong still held the center back position. The Northumberland's left wing, Harison, was replaced by Xin Posheng.</p>
<p>From Defeat to Victory, How Can the Donghua Team Return in Triumph?</p>
<p>- Jiaoda Takes the Lead in the First Half -</p>
<p>Donghua and Jiaoda played a friendly match at Xujiahui. In the first half, Donghua was defeated, with Jiaoda leading 2-0. In the second half, Donghua scored three consecutive goals, resulting in a 4-2 victory for Donghua.</p>

<p>Zheng Zhaojia's Partner is Slightly Inferior</p>
<p>In the French Chamber of Commerce Hard Court Tennis Championship, the Zheng Zhaojia and Zheng Yuankai duo unfortunately lost to Klinov and Tuina despite having the advantage. There were a total of three matches yesterday, with two forfeits.</p>
<p>The Defeat of the Two Zhengs</p>
<p>Klinov 3-6 Zheng Zhaojia</p>
<p>8-6</p>
<p>Tuina 6-2 Zheng Yuankai</p>
<p>The two Zhengs won the first set with a score of 6-3. In the second set, they lost four consecutive games. Zheng Zhaojia then made a strong effort to catch up to 4-4 and then took the lead with 6-5. Unexpectedly, they failed at the last moment. In the crucial 13th game, they lost three consecutive games and lost the set 6-8. In the final set, they collapsed and lost 2-6. Zheng Zhaojia did not seem to be at his best yesterday. He lacked control of the ball. The two Zhengs had too many serves that failed to clear the net, especially Zheng Yuankai. Yuankai's ball control was poor, with the ball hitting the net and going out of bounds. Most of the points were lost due to this. Both used topspin shots, which were not suitable for doubles, giving the opponent a chance to block. What do the two gentlemen think? Zheng Zhaojia's net play and long-range shots from the baseline were excellent.</p>

<p>Time: Two Hours and Twenty-Seven Minutes</p>
<p>Alarming the Entire City</p>
<p>The annual Shanghai International Walking Competition has been dominated by the Chinese team for three consecutive years. To maintain this past glory, they must prepare in advance. With the competition scheduled for the 6th of next month, preparations are rapidly approaching completion. A second full-length seventeen-mile hard training session was held the day before yesterday (1st). Veteran team member Shen Zengjue is far away in Ningbo, and strong contender Lü Wenxia was unable to participate due to other commitments. Zhang Zao Cun, one of the pioneers of the sport, was also unable to revive his form due to being busy. Furthermore, Zhou Yuyu, the international champion, has no intention of joining again. This year, the team's overall strength will be affected. However, veteran athletes Shi Jinsheng, Zhang Zaojiu, Hou Genren, Xie Xingdao, Zhou Ruquan, as well as newcomers Lü Wenxia, Xu Luchen, Lü Chongyi, and others, totaling more than twenty people, have been diligently training daily to seize victory. More than forty people participated on this day, and Yao Shuen and Wang Mingzhi, who had not been present for some time, also joined in. In the end, about thirty people reached the finish line. The results of the top ten are listed below:</p>
<p>First place: Shi Jinsheng, 2 hours 27 minutes (new record)</p>
<p>(Zhou Yuyu's time: 2 hours 32 minutes 25 seconds)</p>

<p>The Voice of Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>— Xianxiang</p>
<p>Nietzsche said it well: "You must seek out your enemies. You must wage your wars." I do not urge you to work. I urge you to fight. I do not urge you to seek peace. I urge you to seek victory. Make your work a war." Nietzsche was a famous modern philosopher in Germany. His philosophy of the Superman had a great influence on the German national character. I feel that a large nation like ours, situated in East Asia where justice is disregarded and Japanese pirates run rampant, should promote this kind of active and enterprising spirit.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Edison Besieged From All Sides <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Wilmington on October 30th from the National Press states: Edison's will stipulates that assets of the Edison Company, worth approximately $14 million USD, are to be given entirely to the children of his second wife. The house only will be converted into a trust fund, with the interest distributed to the six children of his first wife. William, the son of the first wife, now claims that he will contest this in court... Chinese old scholars generally criticized after reading this telegram, saying, "Edison probably didn't go to university, so he's caused this mess. The Great Learning clearly states, 'Investigate things, then knowledge extends; knowledge extends, then intentions are sincere; intentions are sincere, then the heart is rectified; the heart is rectified, then the person is cultivated; the person is cultivated, then the family is regulated; the family is regulated, then the state is rightly governed; the state is rightly governed, then the whole kingdom is made tranquil and happy.' Who told him to only investigate things and not regulate his family?"</p>
<p>Socialists also do not spare him. They say:</p>
<p>"Money belongs to society. You should pass it from father to son, son to grandson. Money is like fertilizer; piling too much on a seedling will burn it to death. You're piling 14 million US dollars on one child of your second wife, loving him but actually harming him. You're practically telling him to take that inexhaustible wealth to indulge in eating, drinking, gambling, and prostitution, burying your beloved son alive in a land of ease. William is also useless. You should learn from your father to invent and create, not freeload off him. Inheriting an inheritance is already useless enough; how much worse is it to fight with your brother over the inheritance? That is even more useless." In short, passing on industry to descendants is the stupidest thing to do. Edison was an exceptionally intelligent man, yet in dealing with his inheritance, he was as foolish as Li Hongzhang and Sheng Xuanhuai, causing his own flesh and blood to start lawsuits and letting lawyers get rich. This is beyond my expectations.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Miscellaneous Notes on the Hawaiian Islands <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Zhaoxi</p>
<p>The Hawaiian Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean. They are shaped like a string of pearls, consisting of eight islands of varying sizes. The area is 6,600 square miles. The islands are rich in agricultural products and have excellent scenery. They are known as the paradise of the Pacific. Although the location is in the tropics, the climate is moderated by the ocean. It is not hot at all in summer. In recent years, many people travel there to escape the heat. It is said that the administrative rights of the islands were originally held by local chieftains. In 1898, the influence of the United States expanded into the territory, and it became a possession. Later, people with aspirations repeatedly sought independence but failed. Liang Qichao traveled to the United States in 1899 and recorded a section in his diary with many feelings:</p>
<p>"...The former queen of the islands now lives in Washington, D.C., as a commoner. The country has been handed over to others. The bright moon shines on the former country, and it is unbearable to look back. Reading Li Houzhu's lines of 'tears wash my face,' onlookers are still saddened. I wonder what the lady, living alone, thinks in her heart. Alas. Nothing is more poignant than the lane of the Black Coats, which is now a newly painted beam in another family's home. How beautiful is this paradise in the Pacific, but unfortunately, those who enjoy it are not the rulers of that capital... "</p>
<p>Alas. Ren Gong is indeed a sentimental person and also deeply patriotic. Now seeing others lose their country and land, he still grieves on behalf of others. At this time, how could he have known that forty years later, China would also be forced into this situation? If he knew in the afterlife, I wonder how extreme his grief would be. (Que Chou)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Remembering Li Zhongjie, Who Died in the Sino-Japanese War <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Shouman</p>
<p>In the twentieth year of the Guangxu reign, our country sent troops to aid Korea due to internal unrest, and war broke out with Japan. At that time, many of our country's generals were arrogant and complacent, which ultimately led to the complete defeat of both the naval and land forces. They ceded territory to seek peace and bowed their heads in submission to the lewd power of the Japanese slaves. The shame can be said to be extreme. At that time, there was a man named Li Zhi, whose courtesy name was Zhongjie, from Jintan, Jiangsu. He graduated from the Beiyang Naval Academy and later served as the chief mate of the Yongjing warship. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1894, he concurrently served as the garrison commander of the left and right wings of the navy. In the sea area of ​​the Yellow Sea, he fought fiercely with the Japanese army for several days and nights without ever retreating. At that time, our country's fleet was largely sunk by the enemy due to improper measures. Although the Yongjing warship was fortunate enough to survive, the enemy was numerous and we were few, and it was not easy to fight. Li had no choice but to say to his subordinates: "Today, we will die whether we fight or not. Rather than waiting to die with our hands tied, it is better to fight to the death. I hope everyone will work hard and not be afraid anymore." Thereupon, the crowd was moved to tears. Li personally operated the artillery and launched a fierce attack on the enemy. The Japanese warships fired several cannons at the same time, and the Yongjing warship was hit and sunk. None of the officers and soldiers survived. Alas, how valiant.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Strange Tales of Bestiality <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>Outside the east gate of Jintan, there is a town called Yaotang. Five miles southwest of Yaotang, there is a small village located in a remote and secluded place, rarely visited by people, commonly called Evil Dog Village. There are no more than ten families in the village, and every family raises dogs. The dogs' nature is particularly fierce and cruel. The owners use them to guard against thugs and petty thieves. Usually, beggars warn each other not to enter the village. Even passersby must first ask the villagers to guide and protect them. The dogs in the village also have special characteristics. They are particularly fond of eating dead human flesh. Almost none of the new graves in the surrounding area with coffins exposed above ground are intact. Often, late at night, the dogs find a coffin. They strike it on the head and break it open, then stick their heads in, drag out the corpse, and devour it together. When the villagers go to check the next morning, only scattered white bones remain. One cool autumn night, a fisherman named Jia set up his net on the riverbank outside the village, working as a fisherman. In the middle of the night, he felt tired and wanted to sleep. He saw a small boat left by water chestnut pickers on the beach next to him. Jia went into it to take a nap and unknowingly fell asleep. Unexpectedly, the dogs saw it and mistook the boat for a coffin and Jia for a dead person. They went forward and fiercely bit his head, dragging him out of the boat. Jia woke up in extreme pain and fought with the dogs, shouting for help. The villagers heard the noise, woke up in alarm, gathered together, and came to his rescue. But Jia's face was already blurred, and blood made him unrecognizable. At dawn, he was carried to the town for medical treatment. My friend, Mr. Mou, happened to be in the town at that time. He saw the situation, felt strange, and questioned him to find out the details. He told me about it, and it was no different from the "wild dogs" mentioned in Liao Zhai. Alas, it is commonly said that there is an Evil Dog Village in the underworld. Unexpectedly, it is actually in the human world. Then, is there truly a hell in the human world?</p>
<p>In my hometown town (in the eastern countryside of Danyang), there is a tofu shop surnamed Yu. The shop kept a male donkey to replace human labor. The donkey's nature was strangely lewd. When grinding, even if its eyes were covered, it would stop working and become violent as soon as it heard a woman's voice. Therefore, the female owner dared not get close to it. One day, it was tied outside the door. A young woman from the countryside went to the market to shop and passed in front of it on her way home. The donkey saw her, forcefully broke its rope, and chased after the woman. The woman ran wildly and was eventually caught by it. The donkey bit her hair with its mouth and used its two feet to pounce on her shoulders. People in the market who saw this clapped their hands and laughed. When the owner heard about it and came to the rescue, the woman's skirt was torn, her skin was broken, and blood was flowing between her thighs. This was because it was the season for wearing thin autumn clothing, so she was easily injured. The woman was both distressed and ashamed, so she summoned her husband to seriously negotiate with the shop owner. After the Yu family provided medical treatment and apologized, the matter was settled. When I returned home and heard about it, I remembered the donkey disaster cases recorded in the notes of ancient people. I then believed that it was not untrue. It is also a strangeness of bestiality.</p>

There are two Chinese opera theaters: Guangdong Grand Theater and Guangwutai. Guangwutai has now ceased operations. There are more than ten dance halls, with Yuegong being the most famous. There are more than forty or fifty teahouses, hotels, and other food stores.</p>
<p>There are about seven or eight banks and trust companies. All of this is enough to make North Sichuan Road prosperous. Most of the residents are Cantonese. There are also many Japanese in the northern section. At the intersection of East Qiu Jiang Road, directly opposite the Audian Theater, the electrical standard clock installed by the Municipal Government has been in use for two or three weeks.</p>
<p>Sunday (November 1st), the Shanghai Grand Theater presents the location</p>

<p>Tour Guides</p>
<p>In the capitals of Eastern and Western civilized countries, there are guidebooks. Beiping is the cultural center of our country. People from far and near hear of it and admire it, and millions of people wish to visit. Yet, there is ultimately no book that can guide tourists. How strange is that? From the Records of Things Seen in the Capital, there are countless books that research the historical sites of Yandu. However, these can provide resources for scholars to explore, but they cannot serve as a guide for tourists. Tourists do not have the time to read them. There are also many works by Westerners describing Beijing, but they are ultimately alienated and do not match the recent situation. Recently, Chen Zongfan from Fujian compiled three volumes of A Comprehensive Study of Yandu, which describes the inner and outer neighborhoods, gardens, and historical sites of Zhou, and uses recent events to prove them. This can be a practical resource, but it is still mostly focused on historical sites and not specifically written as a tour guide. Matters such as markets, trade, food, and recreation are not included in the plan. The guidebooks published in the market are bland and tasteless, and insufficient to evoke the feeling of sightseeing. In the spring of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the Municipal Government's Prosperity Design Committee planned to write a book to meet this need. The draft had already been prepared, but the political situation changed, and it was shelved. Furthermore, the committee believed that Westerners who came to visit were unfamiliar with the place and often hired open-air interpreters near the Beijing Hotel as travel companions. These people were ignorant and knew nothing about historical sites. They repeated errors and perpetuated falsehoods, which brought shame to the country. It was proposed to open a training institute to cultivate such talents. This matter also ultimately came to nothing. Now, hundreds of American tour groups come every year. Even if the Municipal Government can send personnel to receive them, it is impossible to explain to them one by one. The civic groups have not yet developed and do not have the ability to fulfill the duties of the host. Think about those who travel thousands of miles to see the glory of the country. Entering this famous capital, there is no one there. They do not know where to go, nor do they know what to buy. They are at a loss and follow others, their eyes are dazzled by the five colors, like the deaf and blind. They cannot name anything and leave. What will their impressions be afterward? Thinking about this, one can only sigh deeply. Now the Municipal Government always complains about the lack of funds. Think about how every tourist who comes must spend at least 100 yuan in Beiping. This 100 yuan is the floating capital of the city of Beiping. The City Chamber of Commerce, in order to receive the incoming capital, should cooperate with the Municipal Government to create a large-scale hospitality agency. It should specialize in taking goods that can cater to the tastes of Westerners, display them with the inherent artistic spirit of our country, mark the prices in European languages, and hire people with new commercial knowledge who can speak European languages to be responsible for reception. Even with the profits, there would be ample surplus to manage the above-mentioned two matters. Why worry about the lack of funds? Some say that in the spring of the twentieth year, the European and American Alumni Association held an arts and crafts exhibition, but the gains were small. This matter is probably not easy to do. However, one does not know that what is displayed should not be limited to arts and crafts. One can collect everything that is a special product of our country, including food, clothing, and playthings. If one only seeks to sell high-priced treasures, it will be difficult. This naturally depends on merchants taking the initiative and the government providing guidance and assistance. It is not too late to catch up quickly.</p>

<p>The concentration point of small newspaper vendors is on Rue du Lieutenant Petiot. Its remaining veins extend south to the intersection of Peng Road and north to Dade Lane.</p>
<p>There are especially many foreign sailors strolling on North Sichuan Road on Sundays. Italians and Americans are the most numerous.</p>
<p>Brief news. The Tianyi Company's new sound film "Spring Colors of the Singing Field" has been showing at the Xinguang Grand Theater, and the box office success is unprecedented. The theater has now negotiated with Tianyi to continue showing it for four days from the 5th, so that those who regret missing it can feast their eyes. It is also heard that Tianyi's second sound film, "Last Love," has also been completed and will be released soon.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>He was talking to himself, and no one paid attention to him. The friend sitting across from him was reading the newspaper, finishing the main section and then looking at the accompanying pictorial. The country bumpkin was still looking at his side, not thinking that his eyes were shooting over. Suddenly, he jumped up and said:</p>
<p>"It's revolting! It's revolting! This world is really revolting! -" Everyone in the third-class carriage was startled by his shouting, not knowing what was the reason. Could a country old man have a mental illness? Everyone came to ask him what was the matter?</p>
<p>"This world is really revolting." He still shook his head and sighed, then said: "No wonder Ashui and Jinduniang said Shanghai is not a good place. They've even published erotic picture books."</p>
<p>"Where is there any erotic picture book?" The gentleman sitting across from him initially had his face covered by the newspaper, and the country bumpkin hadn't seen him clearly. Now, he saw a young man who looked like a university student. "You're still saying it's not an erotic picture book?" The country bumpkin pointed at the pictorial in the young man's hand. "Aren't there photos of naked girls printed on it? With big boobs sticking out and big butts sticking out. Do you think I, a country bumpkin, can't see this clearly?"</p>
<p>It turned out that the pictorial was printing a famous painting of a beautiful nude by the French Baron and several photos of recent female swimmers. Although they were all wearing swimsuits, their shapely breasts naturally protruded in front. People in Shanghai were already accustomed to it, and those photographed girls were already generous and shameless, but it shocked the country old man.</p>
<p>"This is called art. This is called human beauty, the beauty of curves. You don't understand that." The young man naturally had to defend the pictorial.</p>
<p>"I certainly don't understand. Is this called art? Thank you – I never believe that you have to take off your pants to be considered beautiful. You said many things about beauty, many things about beauty, and I can't remember many. If not wearing pants is considered beautiful, then everyone on this train should take off their pants. Why don't we all come and be beautiful together?" The country bumpkin became more and more energetic, and he was about to say all kinds of nonsense.</p>
<p>"Only when beautiful people are naked does their beauty show. Not just anyone can show beauty. Like you, a country old man, with a haggard and withered body, can you say you have any curves or human beauty after you're naked?" The young man also refused to give way in words.</p>
<p>"I am naturally a haggard and withered old man and have no beauty. Well then, you're a fair and plump young man. You can take off your pants and let people see your beauty." At this time, the country bumpkin also became angry.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Financial Gold Prices Plunge, Slight Rebound <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Slight Improvement Trend, Peace</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold price drop has subsided. The price of gold has slightly rebounded. However, the situation is peaceful. From morning to noon, the difference is only six taels. It usually hovers around six hundred and eighty, and people's hearts are still unsettled. In the end, it rebounded by two taels, which is the opposite of the many days of decline. The buying and selling of each firm is different. Silver bars have been rising frequently. However, the European market seems weak, and American sellers are strong. Therefore, it rose as soon as it opened, and some people deliberately created an atmosphere, saying that a certain major firm plans to take a long position, intending to squeeze the large short sellers, and so on. In the future, it will advance and retreat abruptly. Foreign exchange is loose abroad but tight at home. However, the industry will continue to be virtuous. At noon, it was outside of eighty taels because Indian remittances were small. It is said that silver bars may fall back in the morning. The market is still closed in the afternoon because it is in the autumn racing season.</p>
<p>It rose as soon as it opened, then hovered. It rose by four taels and five qian as soon as it opened, to six hundred and eighty-one taels. Large silver bars still rose by eleven-sixteenths. Futures rose by five-eighths. The silver price was two taels lower due to holidays and the lack of new telegrams, at seventy-eight taels and five qian. Suddenly, it rebounded by two taels to eighty taels and seven qian at nine o'clock. The British gold announcement rose by six and two-fifths, and the US dollar also rose by one yuan. It was sold by Daxingyong and others, and immediately went down three taels, to seventy-seven taels and seven qian. At that time, Zhifeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, Yuda and others bought it, and Mitsui absorbed 33.125 US dollars, so the price rose again by three taels, to eighty taels and five qian. Then, Yuanmao, Yongnei, Xing Shenkang and others came to sell it, and Dehua and Zhejiang jointly made three-month British gold at 1.9125. Hua Bank bought US dollars at 33.1875, and the price fell back by three taels. At nine-thirty, it was seventy-seven taels and two qian. Soon, Qianchangxiang, Zhi Yongyuan, Xing Yongtong, Taichang, etc. successively paid in, and people's hearts seemed good. Huifeng absorbed 33.125 to 33 US dollars, and Sumitomo and Macgalley jointly made British gold at 1.9.1875, so the gold price was six taels and zero cents, of which only one tael was circulating. Around ten o'clock, it was eighty-three taels and five. After entering, the four sides were active. Yuanxing, Shui Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng Chengfengyong, Neixing and others sold it, and the US dollar added to 33.125, and the potential weakness of the market became more and more relaxed, falling by more than five taels. At ten thirty, it was seventy-eight taels. Afterwards, the receipts and payments of each firm were complicated, but there were no large numbers, and the price rotated around eighty taels. Until eleven-fifteen, it increased slightly by two taels, which was bought by Tong Taichang, to eighty-one taels. Before long, a small surface appeared again, and Wanxingshun Li Yuanmaoyong continued to sell it, and those who sold British gold to the bank needed 1.9375 to 3125, and the US dollar was 33.1875. At noon, it only fell to seventy-eight taels, and suddenly heard that the Indian exchange Xiao Fu 12 Anna You Yuanheng and others pursued it, and it rose again by two taels, to eighty taels. Compared with the previous afternoon (according to the listed price), it rose by two taels, which is called a big drop and a small rebound. According to the semi-day, the most people were 83 and a half taels, and the smallest was 77.2 taels, a difference of 6.3 taels, 80 taels for items, 78 taels and 8 qian for the opening price, and the closing price was changed to 747 taels, counting 70 taels to 634 taels, and then 667 taels. The ledger supplemented the water with 79 taels, and the bare account added 9.25.</p>
<p>Speculative buying and selling were not exciting. According to the surface transaction statistics, Qianchangxiang, Zhifengyong, Yuanheng, Tong Taichang Yuda, Yuantai, and Hengchangyong all entered. Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanxingyong Daxingyong, Hengxing, Bingxing, Yuanmaoyong, Chengfengyong, Tianxiang, Shenkang, etc. all sold more than they bought. Dadecheng entered and then exited. Cuichangyong came out first and then entered. Futaiheng, Longsheng, Yuhe, Yichang, Tongfu, Huixiang, etc. had complex receipts and payments, and occasionally grabbed them. Speculators Wu and foreign merchants sold them all. The Dalian gang issued a total of more than 1,700 silver bars and entered more than 400 or 500. They had already become bulls. The Guangdong gang issued another 1,000 silver bars.</p>
<h3 id="e106">British and American Exchange Rates Take Different Paths, Bright and Dark <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The listed price continues to increase by two and a half gears.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British silver rose frequently, but the sellers were unwilling to prevent a reaction. The American silver was closed due to holidays, and the British and American exchange rates shrank again. The Huifeng listed price has been increased by two and a half gears, with British gold increasing by 625, currently at one shilling eight pence 75, and the US dollar also increased by one yuan, with a total of 32.125 yuan. Hong Kong plummeted by 875, with a total of 76.25 taels. All other exchange rates have been increased. The bank's transaction price was first firm, then frustrated, and then flat. As a result, compared with the previous afternoon, the British gold shrank slightly by 0.0625, and the US dollar shrank by 0.1875. It is true that the different trends of brightening and darkening are due to the gold market seemingly rebounding by two or three taels, and people's hearts are implicitly stable. Chinese merchants trade unrestrictedly, such as Chengfengyong and Fuchang Yuanmaoyong, which are generally dumped. There are occasional gold hedging, with British gold trading no more than tens of thousands of pounds. Banks have mutual trades, and US dollars total about 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Huifeng Macgalley and Hua Bank have fresh appetites. In the afternoon, due to the late autumn racing season, the market is still closed.</p>
<p>The British exchange rate has a difference of 1.875, with the tightest being one shilling and nine onces 125 and the loosest being 3125. The asking price in the early market was 25, and the buying price was 1.875. Zhejiang bought 25 in March, which was sold by Dehua. Afterwards, it was sold again for 25 in March. Zhongnan bought it.

Maxing bought 1.875 in January, and also jointly made 125 with Mitsui. Huifeng entered 125, and Maxing entered 33.0625 in February. Huifeng then entered 33 yuan in February, and then entered 0625 in February. Shanghai entered 125. The closing price at noon was 33 yuan to 125, and the buying price was 0625 to 1.875. The listed price of the US dollar was one yuan, totaling three taels, one qian, two, eight, and four points.</p>

<p>The yarn market is flat and unremarkable, and the form is extremely scattered, with no spirit of revitalization. In fact, the current situation is still swaying and the money market is difficult to ease, which leads to the softening of people's hearts and the extinction of transactions. The current yarn transaction is flat, and the yarn market will temporarily remain in a hovering situation.</p>
<p>People's Standard Transaction Clearing Market is Quiet: The market opened before people's standard market, and the market was extremely calm due to the small number of transactions in the market. Each month rose by 1 or 2 cents. In the afternoon, it was still flat and rose by 1, 2 or 3 cents. The total transaction statistics for the day were 7,500 bales. It was found that 900 bales of Minghua were sold, 450 bales of Yichang, 350 bales of Changfeng, and 300 bales of Yiyu. 550 bales of Gongtai were bought, and 850 bales of Gengfeng.

<p>The cotton market is flat and tired, and the trend of falling is gradually rising. The situation of American cotton is flat, and the sharp rise in silver prices has made the calculation of foreign cotton very cheap. Therefore, recently, various factories have absorbed a large amount of cotton. The transaction of local cotton has been stopped. Now the price of foreign cotton is one or two lower than the previous day. As a result, people's hearts are weaker and speculators tend to throw it out. Only some bulls have not yet emerged. Someone is shorting cotton in various producing areas and preparing to deliver it. In short, the price of standard cotton is too high, and the import of foreign cotton is more prosperous. The future of the cotton market is still dangerous.</p>
<p>Han Standard fell by 2 and a half cents: The Han Standard opened in the previous market. The American cotton market was closed and the silver market grew greatly. The market atmosphere was flat. Each month fell by 5 cents to 1 and a half cents. In the afternoon, the bulls closed out and fell by 1 or 2 cents. The total transaction statistics for the day were 53,000 dan. It was found that Changhe sold 3,800 dan, Changfeng sold 4,000 dan, Gongtai sold 1,900 dan, Tongyu sold 1,200 dan, and Deki sold 1,700 dan. Senkang bought 2,300 dan, Ruiyuan bought 2,100 dan, Yongchang bought 1,600 dan, and Jifeng bought 1,500 dan. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The source of Nantou yesterday was scarce, and the sales market in this city was stronger than before. Changxi Beigeng and Su Tong Gang showed the strongest trend, and the price rose by 2 or 3 corners. The Ge kiln variety of sand boats helped to handle nearly a thousand stones, and the price increased by 1 or 2 corners. Bai Dao Feilai Feng retail was slightly rich, and the price was in accordance with the original plate. Duyangjian Township sales continued to advance, and the market was tight. The sales of foreign rice were active. Due to the small arrival and active sales of Indica rice in the river, the price was also strong.</p>
<p>The source of Xinzha yesterday was not much, and was blocked by the strong wind in Pujiang. The producing market initially followed the situation in Shanghai, but then turned firm due to customer inquiries, resulting in a reduction in the number of ships in this port. The market opened in the morning and the transactions in this street were quite prosperous. The sales of Xinxin top goods were active, and the price increased by 2 corners. Baige rice was slightly tight, and the price of Bodu jian also increased by 1 corner with the Japonica market. Chen broke goods were scarce and firm. The arrival and sales of Baiyuan were both flat and the price fluctuated. The kiln 6 species arrived in abundance, and the price was soft by 2 corners first.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Foreign Rice Sales are Active and Continue to Rise <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The elimination of this street is very good</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation of the foreign rice market in this street turned active. After the arrival of Dumai was less and the price rose, it was also heard that the prices in Anhui and Jiangxi markets reported an increase. Therefore, people's hearts were optimistic, and this street paid attention to the income of foreign rice again. The appetite of this street was strong, and the market rose by 1 or 2 corners or more. The futures price was high, and the foreign firms did not sell it. The total market opened 2,000 bales of small twists, priced at 10 yuan, 0, 3 corners to 10 yuan, 0, 1 corner and 8 fen, 500 bales of Saigon No. 1, priced at 11 yuan, 6 corners and 4 fen to 11 yuan, 7 corners and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Russian Wheat Harvest is Poor and the Flour Market Rebounds <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the quotations for foreign wheat in the markets of each month rebounded by about 3, 4 or 5 corners, so a part of people's hearts were slightly weak. The near and far months fell by 1 or 2 points from the previous day's closing. Until the opening in the afternoon, the market gradually rebounded again. According to the general people's speculation, the turning point of the European and American wheat markets is because of the poor harvest in Russia, and powerful selling pressure can be avoided. If this is true, then the foreign wheat in China may have to stop temporarily. For this reason, the hearts of people inside and outside the industry have become more stable. As a result, there was no change in this month, 5 li in December, and 2 or 4 points in January and February respectively.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Futures Wheat Rebounds High in the Afternoon <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the markets of each month in the futures wheat market in the morning were slightly depressed due to the quotation of foreign wheat rebounding by 3, 4 or 5 corners. It is estimated that the recent period was 35 points lower than the previous day, and the distant period also fell by 34 points. However, the current orders cannot be active, and the powerful selling households are of course limited. Therefore, although it once fell, it gradually became stable. Until the opening in the afternoon, it still made up for the floating short, and the temporary speculation absorbed it quite smoothly, and the market gradually rose. Looking at the later steps, if there is no special change in foreign wheat, it may have to rise a little bit. As a result, this month was 1 point better than the previous day, December, January and February were 1 point smaller, March was 2 points better and April was not moving.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Sugar Market: Coarse Sand and White Grades Fall <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>

<p>Yesterday was still in the Autumn Race period, and silk scarves in this port were almost stagnant because the important Westerners in each foreign firm took a vacation to travel to the mainland. Chinese silk merchants were also watching because the price was small. Yesterday, only Lianna entered 10 packages of Xiaoche Huang factory, and Yuanxing and others entered 13 packages of Huang crude silk, and the price was flat and tired.</p>

<p>Silk factory hot cocoons are sold in Japan. Sanjing, Harada, Yinghua and others in this port usually handle hot cocoons, which account for eight out of ten of my country's output. The rest are purchased by mainland cotton strippers and silk factories. After my country severed diplomatic relations with Japan, the Japanese sales stagnated. Mainland customer sales have also been reduced due to the clear and tired silk sales, resulting in thicker inventory. Recently, silk factory hot cocoons are almost no one asked about, and the selling price has gradually fallen to within 20 taels.</p>

<p>Leopard skin velvet is specially used for coat pockets. Now is the time when it is popular and sells well. Customers in this street have a considerable purchase, and their continued demand is very strong. The market is quite tense, but the inventory is extremely scarce, resulting in a rise in the selling price. Yesterday, Wei leopard skin velvet was sold at 5 taels of net disc across the board, Taihe No. 1 was 5 taels and 4 qian, and No. 1 was 4 taels, 9 qian and 5 fen</p>
<p>In the past, sea tiger velvet was sold exclusively by hat workshops. Since the popularity of making women's coats last year, the sales market has suddenly become popular, and Western-style tailor shops have also purchased them. The price has also risen sharply. At present, this kind of Yuanqing sea tiger velvet is very popular in the market. The customers in this street, each hat shop and Western-style clothing industry, have a strong appetite. The trend is very smart. The new goods have now arrived, and the stock of goods in and out of Shanghai Port is not much, and there is a general situation of insufficient supply. The price of Shanghai Road City in the Guild Hall has risen more than Qian Yu compared with last week. Yesterday, good Hua · Miyi · Rongtai and other brands of sea tiger velvet were sold in whole boxes at 8 taels and 2 and a half qian across the board, and tickets were issued.</p>

<p>Eighteen sheets of smoke skin iron, which was previously in short supply, and the price tended to rise. It is estimated that each load was sold at 11 taels and 5 qian. In recent days, various foreign warehouses have had news of arrival. Therefore, the market has turned loose, and the price is only 11 taels and 2 qian per load, which is slightly retracted than before. It is heard that Tianjin has no taste, and Qingdao and Yantai have less embellishment. Therefore, the whole city has a loose scene.</p>

<p>White lead skin transactions have been sluggish and slow recently due to the fact that the actual delivery is also dull. The market is not vibrant. The standard has not risen, and the inner plate has a downstream trend due to oversupply.

<h3 id="e124">Beijing and Guangdong Representatives Held the Sixth Preparatory Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Beijing Representatives First Exchanged Opinions After Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>A Conversation Was Held in the Morning and the Sixth Meeting Was Held in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The Discussion on the Fourth Plenary Session Problem Was Not Completed and the Meeting Was Temporarily Extended</p>
<p>Waiting for the Reply from Guangdong, the Meeting Can Continue This Morning</p>
<p>Guangdong Representatives Plan to Propose a Proposal to Protect People's Freedom</p>
<p>Since the morning of the 1st, the Beijing and Guangdong representatives have exchanged opinions on party affairs issues in the conversation meeting. As a result, both parties agreed to temporarily formulate three items regarding the opening method of the Fourth Plenary Session. The Beijing representatives immediately went to Beijing that night to ask for instructions, and the meeting was temporarily adjourned. At 8:00 a.m. yesterday, the Beijing representatives Zhang Jingjiang, Zhang Ji, Wu Tiecheng, accompanied by Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, He Yingqin, etc., returned to Shanghai. At 10:30 a.m. yesterday, all the Beijing and Guangdong representatives held a conversation meeting at Wu's residence. Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, etc. also attended. It was not until 12:00 that it ended. The result was still satisfactory. The atmosphere of the peace meeting showed a turning point. At 4:30 p.m., the Beijing and Guangdong representatives formally held the Sixth Preparatory Meeting and adjourned at 6:00 p.m. The content of the discussion was still focused on the issue of the opening method of the Fourth National Congress. The Beijing representatives conveyed the will of Beijing, accepted the first item of the three temporarily set methods, and the Guangdong representatives agreed to telegraph Guangdong for instructions, and then announced the adjournment. It was decided to continue the Sixth Preparatory Meeting at 10:00 a.m. this morning. At that time, the reply from Guangdong should arrive and the discussion will continue. Now I will describe what I heard yesterday as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e125">Negotiation Process of the Party Affairs Case <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Both parties' representatives believe that the party affairs issue is very important. This time, there should be a precise discussion to seek concrete measures to prevent internal disputes in the party in the future. Therefore, the two parties' representatives conducted two studies at Wu's residence on July 31 and this month's 1st, and then agreed on three methods for the Fourth National Congress: (1) The representatives of both parties will merge and hold a meeting; (2) Beijing and Guangdong will hold meetings at the same time, but the list of the Fourth Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members will be agreed upon by both parties first, and then passed by both parties' conferences; (3) The conference will be postponed until next year. After the above three methods were agreed upon, the representatives of both parties reported to the central government for instructions and chose one to handle. The Guangdong representatives used telegrams to ask for instructions, and the Beijing representatives took advantage of the preparatory meeting's adjournment to recommend Zhang Ji, Zhang Jingjiang, Wu Tiecheng, and Chen Mingshu to go to Beijing in person to ask the central government for instructions. After Zhang Ji and others reported to Beijing, after discussions among the various committees of the central government, it was decided to adopt the first method, with all the representatives of both parties attending and merging the meetings. In case the Guangdong Plenary Session representatives do not arrive before the 12th, it is possible to hold the opening ceremony on the 12th first, and the conference can be delayed for a few days to allow the Guangdong Plenary Session representatives to arrive. Zhang Ji and others brought this mission back to Shanghai the night before yesterday. When they arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, they went to Wu Tiecheng's mansion on Haige Road to hold a preliminary meeting. In addition to the five representatives Zhang Ji, Zhang Jingjiang, Wu Tiecheng, Cai Yuanpei, and Chen Mingshu, there were also Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, Zhu Peide, He Yingqin, etc. After discussing for two hours, they all agreed to make this meeting a complete success. At 10 o'clock, they went to Wu's residence with the Guangdong representatives to hold a conversation meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Conversation Meeting at Wu's Residence in the Morning <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Before the conversation meeting was held, the Guangdong representatives also held a meeting once. After receiving the notice from the Beijing representatives, they arrived at Ren Wu's residence on Gordon Road one after another at about 10 o'clock to prepare for the meeting. At 10:25, the Beijing representatives and others arrived at the meeting from Wu's residence on Haige Road. After the representatives of both parties arrived, they began an informal discussion at 10:30. In addition to the Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Chen Youren, Li Wenfan, Zou Lu, Wu Chaochu, and the Beijing representatives Zhang Ji, Wu Tiecheng, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Jingjiang, and Chen Mingshu, Central Committee members Yu Youren, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Shao Lizi, etc. also participated in the discussion. It lasted about one and a half hours until 12:00 noon. As a result, according to the Beijing and Guangdong representatives Zhang Ji, Sun Ke, etc., they are still exchanging views based on the three methods temporarily formulated in the first conversation meeting to solve the problem of the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session.</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Sixth Meeting is Postponed <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>At the conversation meeting at Wu's residence yesterday morning, it was decided to hold the Sixth Preparatory Meeting of the Beijing and Guangdong representatives at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. At that time, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, etc. arrived at Wu's residence first. Before long, the Beijing representatives also arrived one after another. The meeting was held at 4:30. The attending representatives were Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Ji, Zhang Jingjiang, Chen Mingshu, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Zou Lu, Wu Chaochu, and Chen Youren. Wang Jingwei was elected as the temporary chairman. After the etiquette was completed, the discussion began. It was completely focused on the issue of the opening method of the Fourth National Congress. First, the Beijing representatives relayed the will of Beijing. After detailed discussions between the two parties, the opinions were still not consistent. The Guangdong representatives, etc., reported the three methods decided in the conversation meeting on the 1st to Guangdong without a reply, so they immediately reported the will of Beijing to the Guangdong Central Party Headquarters and asked for instructions on everything. After the reply arrived, a decision was made, and the adjournment was announced. It was decided to continue the Sixth Preparatory Meeting at 9:30 a.m. or 10:30 a.m. this morning. If there is still no reply from Guangdong at that time, a meeting will also be held.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Important Talks by Various Central Committee Members <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The three committee members, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, and Shao Lizi, came to Shanghai by car together yesterday morning (4th) and went to Wu's residence on Haige Road to talk with the central representatives. Committee member Yu Youren also arrived, and then went to Wu's residence on Gordon Road to participate in the conversation meeting of both parties. A reporter then met with the four gentlemen and asked about their feelings about the prospects for peace. The four gentlemen were all optimistic, because the crux of the current meeting has entered the problem of the Fourth National Congress. In the two conversation meetings on the 31st and 1st, three plans were drawn up: (1) The two parties of Beijing and Guangdong will gather to hold a meeting; (2) The two parties of Beijing and Guangdong will hold meetings separately, but they will act in a spirit of cooperation; (3) Postpone the meeting and select another representative. The four representatives Zhang Chen Zhang Wu entered Beijing on the evening of the 1st to ask the central government for instructions on this. After the decision was made to adopt the first method, because only this party can fully express the true unity to deal with the current national crisis. At first, there were concerns that there were too many people and there was no such large venue, but in order to promote unity, all difficulties were eliminated. The number of representatives from Guangdong was not limited, and the whole group gathered to hold a meeting. The original date of the meeting was November 12, and it was impossible to change the views of rushing to the national crisis and expressing unity, but it was feared that the representatives from Guangdong could not arrive in full. It is proposed to postpone the formal meeting for a few days after the opening ceremony. This afternoon, this decision will be submitted to the preparatory meeting for consultation. Both parties are sincerely seeking the unity of the party, and they are deeply convinced that a satisfactory result will be obtained.</p>
<h3 id="e129">New Proposal from the Guangdong Representative <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Far East News Agency reports that Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei and others, after the passage of the reform proposal for the central political system, drafted a bill to protect the freedom and rights of the people. Due to consecutive adjournments, it was not submitted. Yesterday, at the sixth preparatory meeting, both parties focused on the issue of the Fourth National Congress and it was not discussed. It is reported that when the meeting opens today, they plan to submit it. A reporter from the Far East News Agency learned yesterday that the gist of the proposal is to prevent the abuse of military power, indiscriminate arrests and punishments of the people, which would create resentment and hinder party governance. The articles stipulating the protection of the people's freedom and rights are as follows: First, the people shall not be arrested, tried, or punished by any military organs or military tribunals, except as stipulated by martial law. Second, party departments at all levels shall not arrest or punish the people, confiscate property, or close down people's business or non-business organizations. Third, the people have freedom of assembly, and shall not be interfered with if they do not carry weapons or directly disrupt social order. Fourth, the people may freely express their opinions through speech, writing, drawing, and other methods. Various printed materials shall not be banned from distribution unless convicted by a court, except for printed materials without a responsible person.</p>

<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen, when he was in Shanghai, once visited Wang Jingwei with Yu Youren and Chen Guofu to inquire about his attitude towards Chiang and Hu. Wang expressed his maintenance of his original position, and they parted without results. According to those close to Wang and Hu, when Wang Jingwei first visited Hu Hanmin, they met and shed tears, sighing incessantly. Afterwards, Wang repeatedly stated that he would follow Hu's lead in everything. Wang and Hu agreed that no matter what, they would never leave Shanghai. Li Jishen is still staying in Shanghai. Rumors that he had recently returned to Guangdong are not true. It was also said that Huang Shaoxiong would return to Guangdong within days after the Guangdong representatives arrived in Shanghai, but according to Huang's aides, this is also inaccurate, and Huang has no such intention at present. Ju Zheng is suffering from severe typhoid fever, with temperatures often above 100 degrees. He has been moved to the Sino-Western Sanatorium for treatment. Doctors say he is still in a critical condition and has prohibited visitors.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Telegraph Urges Wang Jixu to Eat <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei, Cai Yuanpei, and other representatives of the Shanghai Peace Conference, after reading the telegram from Wang Jixu, the Dean of Academic Affairs of Peiping Institute of Technology, announcing his hunger strike, were deeply moved. However, because the resolution of the peace conference would take time and could not be immediately achieved, they sent a telegram yesterday via Wang and Cai urging him to eat. The original telegram stated, "Respectfully to Mr. Wang Jianlu, Dean of Academic Affairs of Peiping University of Technology: Your special telegram forwarded by Mr. Chen Lifu is respectfully received. The purpose of this conference is to resolve years of disputes with sincerity and unity. Success is inevitable, but various issues are complicated and cannot be completed in a few days. A hasty and perfunctory approach would mislead the future, which Mr. would not approve of. We respectfully request that you cease your hunger strike and provide us with guidance. All colleagues at the meeting share this view. We hope you will consider it." Wang Zhaoming, Cai Yuanpei, Zhi Yin.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Telegram from Teachers and Staff of Secondary Schools <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The teachers and staff of secondary schools in Shanghai sent a telegram to promote peaceful unification, saying: "To Mr. Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, Mr. Hu Zhantang, Mr. Wang Jingwei, Mr. Cai Zimin, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, Mr. Wu Chaochu, Mr. Li Shizeng, Mr. Chen Youren, Mr. Zhang Puquan, Mr. Zou Haibin, Mr. Chen Zhenru, Mr. Li Wenfan, Mr. Wu Tiecheng in Shanghai: Since the founding of the Republic of China, our people have been hoping and disappointed every day. The Qing Dynasty was bad, and there was the Xinhai Revolution. At that time, the people of the whole country believed that after the revolution, the country would become rich and strong day by day. The desire for good governance was indescribable. Unexpectedly, in the past ten years, Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, Zhang Xun restored the monarchy, the Anfu clique harmed the country, Cao Kun bribed votes, warlords divided the country, and wars continued for years. The country's affairs deteriorated, and the National Revolution arose. When the National Revolutionary Army launched the Northern Expedition, it left Shaoguan, went down to Nanchang, conquered Wuhan, captured Nanjing, took Jinan, and reached Peiping. In less than two years, the Northern Warlords were almost completely wiped out. The people, who had been disappointed for a long time, cheered wildly, and their hopes for the future of the National Revolution surpassed those of the Xinhai Revolution. How could they know that after four years, the war would not end, and the great plan of political tutelage has not yet been realized. Now, refugees are everywhere, and the violent Japanese invade the country's life. The national spirit is in imminent danger, and the people's mentality can be said to have gone from disappointment to despair. Recently, party and government officials also know that peaceful unification cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, the peace conference is held in Shanghai. Although the people are in despair, they still see this as a glimmer of hope for the country. However, judging from the situation in recent days, the future of the peace conference is difficult to be optimistic about. We believe that since the party and government officials are all believers in the Three Principles of the People and have all received the Premier's will to work hard for the National Revolution, since they hold the same doctrine and want to achieve the same goal, what contention is still unresolved and cannot be understood? Political views and policies are by no means absolutely good or bad. If the officials are truly for the country and the people, there must be room for negotiation and consensus. Otherwise, our people will recognize that what the officials are fighting for must be private interests, and they will not be able to understand the officials. The officials may have followed the Premier, devoted themselves to the revolution, or dedicated themselves to the party and the country, and served on the battlefield. Their love for the country is something that we and others cannot match. In the face of national crisis, there is no reason to remain indifferent. If they are still fighting for private interests, then the country will be destroyed and the family will perish together. The officials are wise and must know this. Seeing the country on the verge of collapse, we can no longer remain silent. We sincerely hope that the officials will unite quickly, secure the country internally and resist foreign aggression, and jointly seek the prosperity and strength of the country. Those who do not hesitate to undermine peaceful unification are truly sinners of the nation, and the people of the country should rise up and denounce them."

<h3 id="e133">Telegram from the Minhang Women's Anti-Japanese Association <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Minhang Women's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association issued a telegram yesterday, saying: "Please forward to Mr. Hu Zhantang and Mr. Wang Zhaoming in Shanghai, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, and all the representatives: The Japanese have occupied the eastern provinces for more than a month. How can we count the number of people who have suffered? The resolution of the League of Nations is in vain. The proposal to withdraw troops is nowhere in sight. Recently, they have seized tax revenues, transferred road rights, spied on Manchuria and Mongolia, and recruited traitors, directly creating a second Korea. The national crisis has reached its extreme. Even if we can work together with one heart and mind to strive against foreign aggression, we still worry that it will not be enough to reverse the critical situation. Since the party and government leaders from both Nanjing and Guangdong gathered in Shanghai, many days have passed, but no agreement has been reached. In this critical moment, every inch of time is precious. Delaying one day will create an opportunity for the Japanese to make more tricks, which is tantamount to delaying the great plan of securing the country internally and resisting foreign aggression. As the ancients said, 'Before the discussion is settled, the soldiers have already crossed the river,' which is a lesson for our country today. As in the European War, political parties with different trends from the governments of various countries also abandoned their prejudices and focused on protecting the country and resisting foreign aggression. The officials are all believers in the Three Principles of the People and will surely work together to defend the country. The association, seeing that disaster is approaching, dares to send a telegram to show its earnestness. We beg the officials to reach an agreement as soon as possible, so as to secure the foundation of the government and undermine the enemy's plans. This is the key to success. The eager hope is shared by the whole country. Please adopt it." Respectfully submitted by the Minhang Women's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Telegram from Women's Volunteer Army <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Appealing to the women of the whole country to rise up together to resist Japan</p>
<p>The Women's National Salvation Volunteer Army sent a telegram saying: "To all female compatriots across the country: The Japanese army is shameless and has occupied our Liaoning and Jilin, and is now spying on Mongolia and Heilongjiang, implementing its Tanaka Giichi plan to annex Manchuria and Mongolia and conquer China. This has become clear. Although the League of Nations has resolved twice to order them to withdraw their troops, Fang Ze voted against it first, and the government then issued a declaration. The failure of the League of Nations' two deadlines for troop withdrawal can be asserted. All our people in the country should be fully prepared for the final stage in order to save the country from its difficulties. The so-called final preparation is to intensify military training at this time, cultivate the spirit of enduring hardship, neatness, and solemnity as a step towards national mobilization, and under a solemn organization, carry out various tasks such as anti-Japanese propaganda and economic severance, so as to use the strength of 400 million people to slightly control the violence of Japan. With this aspiration, the Shanghai Women's National Salvation Volunteer Army is being organized and prepared. The establishment will be established in a fortnight. We are planning to extensively solicit comrades to take on the difficult task together and fulfill the duty of a citizen. However, it is only a very small part of the country. At this time, the thousands of miles of territory of Liaoning and Jilin have fallen into the hands of the powerful bandits. The change is ten times more serious than the loss of the Sino-Japanese War. Although the people's hearts are indignant, the women's anti-Japanese national salvation organization is not yet widespread. It is not enough to show the strength of our people's unity, and it is appropriate to extend the situation of the Japanese government's stubborn resistance. I dare to sincerely plead before the women of the country to rise up together today to form an anti-Japanese national salvation organization. Not only do we feel that the sound is not isolated and the support is reliable, but also the great task of saving the country adds 400 million women to help. Whether it is in terms of propaganda or economic severance, it is enough to produce great results. The key to controlling the enemy may be tied to this. I respectfully express my humble opinion and await your wise teachings.</p>

<p>Work of the Sino-Japanese Trade Commodity Investigation Institute: Due to the recent invasion of Northeast China by the violent Japanese, the whole country is indignant and is jointly seeking economic severance with Japan. However, all parties find it difficult to identify Japanese goods. In order to thoroughly boycott Japanese goods and seek ways to compensate, the institute has set up various investigation and research groups to carry out all tasks. There is also a consultation group dedicated to providing consultations to all circles on domestic and Japanese goods. If people from all walks of life have any doubts, they can directly write to the consultation group at No. 23 Yuanmingyuan Road to inquire. The institute has a detailed list of domestic and Japanese goods, and can provide satisfactory answers.</p>

<p>Regarding the incident on the 28th of last month in which Japanese sailors robbed goods and injured people in Pudong, Huang Guangdou, the chief of the second section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, personally went to the Japanese consulate to lodge a verbal protest. At the same time, the bureau also investigated the details of the matter and reported it to the municipal government. According to the New Voice News Agency quoting Mayor Zhang yesterday, the municipal government formally submitted a written protest to the Japanese consulate general after receiving a detailed report and investigation of the matter. The content is divided into four points: (1) Please severely punish the sailors who landed and robbed goods and injured people. (2) Compensate the injured workers for medical expenses. (3) Make a formal apology. (4) Guarantee that similar unfortunate events will not happen again in the future. Mayor Zhang also said that although the goods robbed by the Japanese were found to be sold by Japanese merchants to Japanese merchants, if the inspectors made a mistake in inspection, they could only report to the Japanese authorities and negotiate with our side through legal procedures. They could never carry out forceful interference and allow Japanese soldiers to commit violence in our territory.</p>

He is expected to return to Shanghai within the next week.</p>

<p>Can be issued within ten days</p>
<p>The shipping industry bonds that Shanghai shipping companies have requested the government to issue have not been implemented for more than a year. The central government recently learned that the Chinese shipping industry can stop the opportunity for development, so it has agreed to find a way for the previously requested bonds. According to Yu Qiaqing of the Shipping Association, he has discussed it properly with Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance and can be issued within ten days. As for the future use, 5 million will be used to establish a shipping bank, and 5 million yuan will be distributed to various Chinese steamship companies.</p>

<p>Business plummeted after being boycotted</p>
<p>All ships of Japanese steamship companies have been abandoned by Chinese people, and various goods have been abandoned and transferred to other ships, resulting in a sharp drop in the business of Japanese ships. Recently, only four ships are running on the Yangtze River. However, in order to save expenses, the compradores of each ship have been dismissed in turn.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Shanghai Inland River Vessels Fully Resumed Operations <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Suspended during the flood season</p>
<p>Losses of more than 200,000</p>
<p>This year, major floods occurred in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Starting in July, all inland river small vessels in the province were completely suspended. Shanghai's wheel companies have been out of business for three months, and the losses have been unprecedented. Afterwards, the ships were ordered to transport people from the disaster areas and were sent to Jiangxi inland to supply dispatches until now when they have resumed operations. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Inland River Fully Open: The first Shanghai inland river small vessel to resume navigation was the Shengou route, followed by the Shenhang route, the Shensu route, and the Shenchang routes. The last to sail was the Zhenyang route. Now the water in the canal has also receded sharply, and small vessels can be sailed to Zhenjiang and Jiangyin. The Shanghai Inland River Merchants Bureau has fully resumed operations of all Zhenyang Chengxi vessels. The bureau has a total of twenty-two routes, which are now all open.</p>
<p>Lake Route Dispute: The Huzhou route is the most competitive of the inland river small vessels in this port. There are six wheel companies running on the morning and evening shifts. In addition to the existing supply, Lixing Xinwheel Bureau has also added ships to the route. The Shenhu morning shift has already started sailing. Zhengchang and other six companies on the Huzhou line have unanimously opposed it and submitted a public petition to the Zhejiang Construction Office, requesting them to prevent and restrict the company, saying that they fear that there will be a wave of competition for navigation, such as the tragedy of the Shenchang class in the ninth year of the Republic of China when a ship was sunk and 27 lives were drowned, and the danger will reappear on the Shenhu line today. The Zhejiang Construction Office has already issued an order to investigate and stop this matter.</p>
<p>Yongan Resumes Operations: During the flood season, the small vessels of a certain company on the Shenhu route in this port destroyed the dike in Huzhou due to their huge horsepower. The Huzhou Farmers Association requested the provincial government to detain the vessel and discuss severe penalties. After more than two months of negotiations, the Huzhou class vessel has now fully resumed navigation, and a certain wheel company has also tried to mediate. According to reliable sources, the wheel company has admitted to paying a huge amount of money to settle the matter of destroying the dike, and the detained vessel will be released and returned on the same day. It can resume normal operations and navigation within this week.</p>
<p>Flood Losses: During the last major flood in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the small vessels were suspended for a long time, resulting in huge losses. According to the Inland River Merchants Bureau, it lost a total of 30,000 taels of silver when the flood stopped navigation, excluding the branch offices in other places. The losses of other wheel companies totaled 200,000 yuan in Shanghai alone.</p>

Only the flagship of the Asian fleet, Houston, and the gunboats Ganmu, Ichetapell, and Pup were still in Shanghai. It is heard that the Houston and Ichetapell will leave Shanghai on the 16th, the Ganmu is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 18th, and the Pup will depart after a ship comes from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>

<p>Discussion of Bribery Case</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Trade Association held its 18th Members' General Meeting at 1:00 PM on the 4th of this month, due to allegations of bribery against Chairman Zheng Zenan. Forty-two members, including Fang Cuihe, were present. He Wei was elected as chairman. The chairman first reported on: (1) the purpose of the meeting, (2) resolutions of the executive committee meetings on October 4th and 9th, (3) the Association's letter to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association on the 3rd of this month, (4) the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's inquiry regarding the report in the newspaper on the 3rd of this month concerning the Association Chairman's alleged bribery through releasing goods. The following matters were then discussed: (1) Ratification of the 31st and 32nd executive committee meeting resolutions regarding the handling of the Yuan Yu Mao He case. Resolution: It was found that the Dongtang sugar sold by Yuan Yu was ordered between April and May. In July, the boycott occurred. Due to the deposit, the firm had to accept the warehouse warrants after the sugar arrived in Shanghai. In September, due to financial difficulties, over two hundred bags were sold. This was before the establishment of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. Many businesses dealing in Japanese goods in this city were in similar situations, and their actions were somewhat excusable. Mao He only had suspicions of violating the previous Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Compatriots Association's announcement, which required that any detained enemy goods be handed over to the association for disposal. The nature of this case is different from the announcement, one being about past events and the other about suspicion. The executive committee's handling of Yuan Yu Mao He on the 9th does not seem to violate the previous Anti-Japanese Association's announcement and should be ratified. (2) Discussion of the allegations of bribery against Chairman Zheng and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's letter of inquiry regarding this case. It was jointly discussed how to handle the case. Resolution: Yuan Yu donated 1,500 yuan to school funding, as stated by Yu Yizhai at the meeting. The firm made the donation voluntarily. Yu Yizhai also admitted that he gave 1,000 yuan to Zhu Anqing, as reported in the newspaper. He personally clarified this to Mr. Zhao at the Anti-Japanese Association at 5:00 PM on the 3rd of this month. Regarding the donation and bribery case, the truth is now clear. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce should be informed of the facts via letter, and a statement should be published in the newspaper.</p>

<p>County Government's Reply to the County Party Department</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government replied to the County Party Department, stating: The county's relocation and bidding for various construction implementation methods have been actively underway under the supervision of the Construction Bureau. Recently, the Construction Bureau was ordered to revise the construction drawings submitted to the Provincial Construction Department. The Construction Bureau is currently working on this, so bidding and construction have had to be slightly delayed. The previous letter was received. In addition to urging the Construction Bureau to complete the revision of the construction drawings and submit them to the county for approval and forwarding, this letter is being sent in response.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Petition from China Merchants Electric Company <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Employee Work Stoppage and Expulsion of Wu Quesheng</p>
<p>Employees of the Shanghai China Merchants Electric Company previously went on strike for three days, demanding that the company improve their treatment and expel Wu Quesheng, the head of the General Affairs Department. After the Municipal Party Department and others sent personnel to mediate, they resumed normal work. Now, the company believes that the right to employ personnel belongs to the company, so it rejected the employees' demands and dismissed Wu Quesheng. Furthermore, the company suffered losses of up to 4,600 yuan due to the employees' work stoppage. Yesterday, Lu Bohong, the manager of the company, submitted a petition to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating: Petition regarding a reply. The company received instruction No. 6640 from your bureau, which stated: In the matter of the company's employees requesting improved treatment, this bureau has decided to order compliance. According to reports, the employees expressed dissatisfaction and suddenly went on strike. A petition was submitted to the Municipal Government for review and judgment. Now, instruction No. 12464 from the Municipal Government was received, instructing on how to handle the matter, etc. Upon receipt, one copy of the original instruction was attached, and personnel from the Municipal Party Department were dispatched to persuade the employees to return to work. Please comply with the instruction. Upon receipt, the company found that the employees' demands for improved treatment were excessively demanding, even resorting to work stoppages to pressure the company. In law and in reason, there was no room for acceptance. However, your bureau repeatedly convened both parties for mediation, earnestly advocating for a peaceful resolution. The company appreciated your intention and reluctantly agreed to mediate, which can be considered a compromise and not a legal obligation to accept. Furthermore, the employees' act of posting slogans to expel Wu Quesheng, the head of the General Affairs Department, was utterly absurd. Wu Quesheng had resigned from the position of head of the General Affairs Department in May of this year due to illness and only served as the head of the Document Department. The manager and executive director had previously contacted your bureau and brought Wu, then the head of the department, along for note-taking. The employees then believed that Wu was obstructing their demands from being fully met and publicly advocated for his expulsion. They do not understand that the right to employ personnel belongs to the company and cannot be claimed by any employee. Therefore, when this matter was brought up for discussion at the board meeting on the 2nd of this month, it was unanimously deemed inappropriate and not approved. This must be stated first. Furthermore, the above-mentioned instruction stated that the company's employees violated the government's repeated orders by arbitrarily going on strike, which is even more inappropriate. This should be investigated and handled separately. The company suffered losses of 4,600 yuan due to the failure to issue tickets during the three-day work stoppage. How should the employees be held responsible for compensating for this loss, and how should they be punished according to the law for arbitrarily going on strike, clearly defying your instruction? Please provide clear instructions to maintain the rule of law. In addition, your bureau initially set the date for the company's reluctant agreement to increase salaries as January of next year. For this year, the company would follow your advice to raise subsidies to draw a clear line. However, the reported solution included the phrase "(to be implemented from October of the 20th year of the Republic)", which is inconsistent with the facts. In addition to having the manager represent the company and present the above-mentioned points in person, this petition is being submitted for clarification. Please review and approve as appropriate for public convenience. Respectfully submitted to Pan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and Lu Bohong, Manager of the Shanghai China Merchants Electric Company Limited. Enclosed: Municipal Government Instruction No. 12464. The petition and accompanying documents have been received and investigated by personnel. Further investigation revealed that paragraph one of the bureau's previously submitted report on the decision regarding the case (a 30% increase for those with monthly salaries of 36 yuan or more) should be cancelled. Please forward this to both labor and management for compliance. The company's employees violated the government's repeated orders by arbitrarily going on strike, which is highly inappropriate, especially during this critical period. This should be investigated and handled separately. Please forward this for notification. This instruction is hereby issued. Attachments are returned. October 30th, 20th year of the Republic of China. Mayor Zhang Qun.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Dafeng Textile Factory Work Stoppage Yesterday <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>All 600 workers at the Dafeng Textile Factory in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, automatically went on strike at 9:00 AM yesterday. After receiving the report, Party and government agencies immediately sent personnel to persuade them, investigate the truth, and handle the matter according to the facts. The details are reported below.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Work Stoppage: The working hours of all workers at the Dafeng Textile Factory were mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau and set at ten hours. Workers in the cloth weaving section claimed that Ye Qiuquan, an official of the factory, pressured workers and instigated his henchmen to force workers to sign agreements to restore the twelve and a half hour work day. Starting at 9:00 AM yesterday, they initiated the work stoppage. Workers in the dyeing and thread sections joined in. However, the factory stated that the factory law stipulates a maximum of ten hours and did not allow it, asking workers to sign voluntarily in order to report to Party and government agencies and request instructions.</p>
<p>Party and Government Persuasion: The 3rd District Dyeing Industry Workers' Union, upon seeing the workers' automatic work stoppage, sent Standing Director Li Junfeng and others to report to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau. The factory also sent Lu Shiyi, director of the personnel department, to report. The Municipal Party Department, fearing the expansion of the dispute, sent Li Weixiong, together with Zhu Guilin of the Social Affairs Bureau, to persuade the workers to resume work first and await legal resolution, and to investigate the truth for handling according to the facts. The result was that all workers insisted on not resuming work unless Ye Qiuquan was dismissed. After repeated persuasion by union members, it is said that work may resume this morning. In general, this dispute is unlikely to escalate.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications promulgated the Charter of the Public Welfare Association of Telecom Personnel of the Ministry of Communications in February of last year and appointed Lu Guixiang and eight other members to establish a preparatory committee in Shanghai. It is understood that since its establishment, the preparatory committee has been registering members who are scattered throughout the country and conducting elections in accordance with the regulations, which has been a lengthy process. Yesterday, the election opening procedure was held at the Telecommunications School in Wangjiamao, Shanghai. Approximately 9,000 members nationwide voted, accounting for more than 80% of the total membership. Members from as far as Xinjiang, Mongolia, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces submitted their ballots on time. Five directors were elected: Chen Dechu, Lin Zebing, He Jiacheng, Xu Hongan. Six directors were elected: Yao Shou Kang, Wang Dachun, Fang Yutian, Hu Xianggui, Fan Yurun, Hong Lingxiao. It is said that they will all come to Shanghai soon to take office and be sworn in.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Invisible Resolution of British Public Bus Strike <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Striking Workers Have Completely Lost Their Jobs</p>
<p>All 222 ticket sellers of the British Public Bus Company went on strike to demand better treatment and oppose the company's unwarranted dismissal of workers. Although Party and government agencies and Chinese directors intervened to mediate, the company's unyielding attitude and rejection of mediation have resulted in no solution for months. All the striking workers, with no avenue for appeal, have had to return their uniforms and badges, sever ties, and find other means of livelihood. The committee requesting reinstatement has been automatically and invisibly dissolved. The company has indicated that it will not rehire any of the striking workers, and has hired new workers. Although all bus lines have fully resumed operation, the new workers are not yet fully trained. All fares are temporarily uniform, with Route 1, 2, 9, and 10 selling for 16 cents and Route 5 selling for 10 cents. It is said that after the company made the ticket prices uniform, the number of passengers has actually increased, and the revenue has increased compared to before. Most of the uniforms of the former striking workers have already been returned.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Continuing Tireless Disaster Relief <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>American Churches Enthusiastically Help with Disaster Relief in Shanghai: The National Christian Council of China in Shanghai received a message from the Federation of Churches in America, the American and Canadian Foreign Missionary Society, and the American Relief for China Famine Association, etc., stating that the China flood relief donation jointly initiated has so far raised 50,000 US dollars. The American Red Cross had previously donated 100,000 US dollars, which had already been remitted to the American Consul in Hankou for transfer to the Wuhan Disaster Relief Authority. It is not yet decided whether the association will again assume the role of fundraising leader to broaden the appeal, as its president, Bei En, is not in America.</p>
<p>Supernatural Rites for Deceased Parents Used to Fund Relief: The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Emergency Relief for Flood Victims in Various Provinces had the following news yesterday: (1) Zhang Gongheng, Relief Commissioner of Anhui Province, came to Shanghai for relief matters in Anhui and consulted with Zhu Ziqiao. It was learned that it has been decided to set up four porridge kitchens in Bengbu, Zhengyangguan, Wuhu, and Anqing in Anhui Province. The remaining matters regarding winter relief have also been discussed. He has already returned to Anhui to supervise implementation. (2) The association received the following major donations yesterday: (A) Mr. Chu Huiseng raised 1,156 yuan. (B) The Shanghai Municipal Chinese Medicine Association first submitted 471 yuan and 12 cents. (C) The Shanghai Medical Association raised 158 yuan on behalf. (D) The China United Sericulture Improvement Association continued to raise 250 yuan. (E) Mr. Zhu Jicai transferred 200 yuan, the money spent on supernatural rites, for his deceased mother's 20th-anniversary memorial, to relief funds. This is a very appropriate move, as it can both commemorate and comfort the deceased parents, and it can also save lives and promote a new way to raise funds, which is much better than hiring monks and priests to perform rituals, increasing the blessings of the deceased. (3) The Anhui Huaining Flood Relief Association telegraphed that the county's disaster victims are sleeping in the open air, exposed to the wind and eating only what is given, requesting the speedy distribution of cotton clothing for relief.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Volunteer to Transport Disaster Victims: Most of the flood victims from various provinces this year have sought refuge in Beijing and Shanghai. The Beijing Municipal Government is sheltering the disaster victims. Now that the floods in various provinces have receded, the disaster victims will all return to their original homes, but they need ships to transport them. A special report has been submitted to the Executive Yuan, ordering the Ministry of Communications to consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ordering the overseas offices stationed in Shanghai to request the consulates of the United Kingdom and the United States to discuss requesting the British and American shipping companies to voluntarily transport disaster victims. Yesterday, the British and American consulates replied to the foreign affairs office, saying that the British and American shipping companies are willing to provide voluntary transportation, but when the company transported disaster victims from the disaster area to Beijing and Shanghai, the transportation group of the National Disaster Relief Association directly contacted the shipping company. Therefore, it is proposed that the transportation group of the Disaster Relief Association also contact them to facilitate the procedures. After receiving the reply, the foreign affairs office submitted it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for notification to the Beijing Municipal Government.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Farmer Commits Suicide in a Year of Famine <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Planting Rice on Seven Acres Yields Only Dozens of Catties</p>
<p>A Family of Eight Has No Way to Make a Living</p>
<p>This year, due to continuous autumn rains and tidal surges, the low-lying fields in Yangxing and Yuepu and other townships in Baoshan County have become swamps, and rice and cotton crops have failed, with no hope for the autumn harvest. The heads of various townships and districts have reported the famine situation to the county. Because it is currently the harvest season, the famine situation is becoming increasingly apparent. Those who sell rice are full of worry, sighing and complaining, and are largely unable to support themselves. A farmer named Sheng in Yangxing Township has 27 mu of grain land and a family of eight, who rely on farming for a living. This year, because all of his fields happened to be planted with rice (the fields in that area are planted with rice for two years out of every three, and with rice for one year), one mu of rice land was not planted. Unexpectedly, the harvest of cotton from these 27 mu of rice land was only dozens of catties (in previous years, it would have been dozens of dan). Therefore, Sheng was heartbroken to see this, filled with anger and worry about how his family of eight would survive in the future. Moreover, he thought that he had not planted rice, and there was no grain in his house, so he was extremely anxious. Therefore, the day before yesterday, after picking dozens of catties of white rice and taking it to the market for sale, he used the money he earned to buy two opium pipes, went home, secretly swallowed them, and lay down. Later, he groaned in pain as the poison took effect. His family did not know that he had committed suicide by swallowing opium. Unexpectedly, he was deeply poisoned, and soon died of suffocation. Only then did his family see the opium stains on his lips and realize that he had committed suicide due to the famine and the inability to maintain his family. The family, young and old, felt even more miserable.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Lawsuit for Letting Dogs Bite People <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Calling a Doctor Results in Being Bitten by Dogs</p>
<p>The Owner Laughs Nearby</p>
<p>Bitten Until Gasping for Breath</p>
<p>Becomes a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Ma Wanyao, the son of the late famous throat doctor Ma Fengbo of Jiangwan, was recently sued in the First Special Court by Wu Boyou, a shopkeeper at Hengfeng Trading Company in Xiaobeimen Dongshunli, who hired lawyers He Sui and Wu Chengyu, accusing him of letting dogs bite people. The complaint stated that the plaintiff was a shopkeeper at Hengfeng Trading Company. On the evening of the 21st of this month (October) at 8:00 PM, because a partner was ill, he went to the clinic of the defendant, Dr. Ma Wanyao, to ask him to come for a consultation. As soon as he entered the door, the defendant released two vicious dogs that he kept, and they bit him fiercely. The defendant laughed nearby. When the plaintiff was injured and fell to the ground, gasping for breath, he ordered the dogs to stop biting. Although he was lucky to have survived, his head and feet were all seriously injured. He asked a surgeon for an examination, who said that it would be difficult to recover completely in a short time and that he might become disabled. He submitted a report to the Procuratorate of the Court on the 22nd, which proved that the injury was real. The defendant has violated Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and is also filing a civil suit, requesting a judgment ordering compensation for medical expenses of 7,700 yuan and other losses of 300 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Dumu presided over the hearing. The defendant also hired lawyer Wen Chao to appear in court, stating that the main subject of the plaintiff's complaint was mistaken, because the defendant, Ma Wanyao, is the son of Ma Fengbo, who died many years ago. At the time, the plaintiff wanted to hire Ma Fengbo. Therefore, Ma Fengbo's grandson, Ma Bosun (i.e., Ma Wanyao's nephew), responded to the consultation, and the dogs were also kept by Bosun. Therefore, the main subject of the plaintiff's complaint is mistaken and should be rejected. The plaintiff's lawyer then stated that the doctor the plaintiff wanted to hire was Ma Fengbo. Now that Fengbo is said to have died many years ago, it is difficult to prove at the time whether the dogs were kept by Ma Wanyao or Ma Bosun, and afterwards, the plaintiff sent a letter to Ma Fengbo, which was received by Ma Wanyao with a seal. Therefore, Wanyao and Bosun should be sued together. Judge Shen ordered the plaintiff's lawyer to file a corrected statement and reschedule the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Hangzhou Kidnapper Wu Tianbao Captured <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Confesses to Shooting Jiang Zhongyun</p>
<p>Accomplice Sun Naitai and Others Captured</p>
<p>On the 24th of last month, Jiang Zhongyun, a detective chief of the Hangzhou County Public Security Bureau, came to Shanghai on a mission to arrest Wu Tianbao, the ringleader of a series of major kidnapping and robbery cases in Hangzhou. He was ambushed in a den at No. 1 Beidiao Fang, Beidiaoao Road, in the French Concession. The bandit had been aware in advance and ambushed next to the escalator on the upper floor. Shooting from above, he seriously injured Detective Jiang and French Concession detective Ni Jinrong and detective Wang Jinyu. Wu escaped from the scene, and Detective Jiang died in the line of duty. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Since the incident, the French Concession authorities have paid extraordinary attention and have repeatedly ordered their subordinates to intensify their efforts to solve the case and bring the notorious thief Wu Tianbao to justice in the shortest possible time for severe punishment. Until 8:00 PM last night, Jin Jiu, inspector general of the special agency of the French Concession Police Department, received a confidential report stating that Wu was hiding during the day and active at night, and his whereabouts were extremely secretive, but every night after 9:00 PM, he would go to Sun Naitai's, a fellow from Shaoxing, on the second floor of No. 9 Taiheli, Baierbu Road, for secret talks. He requested that detectives be dispatched to arrest him as soon as possible. Upon hearing the report, Inspector General Jin immediately led a full team of detectives, including detective Li Yaolong, deputy detective Mao Jingen, Qian Yumin, Zhang Ziying, and detective Qin Youyu, disguised themselves and went to the vicinity of the police kiosk to wait. At 9:10 PM, Wu arrived, looking around suspiciously, and went into No. 9. The detectives surrounded the area and stormed into the house, capturing the bandit on the spot and seizing a loaded pistol with seven bullets, along with his accomplice Sun Naitai and four other suspects. They were all detained in the police station. After a preliminary interrogation by the police chief, Wu, 31 years old, from Shaoxing, confessed to the previous shooting and resistance to arrest. The police chief ordered him to be detained pending extradition to the court for severe punishment.</p>

<p>Since the Chinese people severed economic ties with Japan, various industries have been thinking about improving domestic products to replace Japanese goods. Xu Ji'an and Wang Shipeng, members of the Shanghai Dye Association, observed that the native cloth produced in Jiangyin, a city in China, has always been very fine. Last month, they sent people to Jiangyin to investigate and find ways to improve, promote, and popularize it. They also organized the Shanghai Improved Native Cloth Promotion Association in order to promote it as much as possible.</p>

<p>Collusion From Inside and Out</p>
<p>The Shop Owner Entrusted the Wrong Person</p>
<p>Fu Boliang from Shaoxing, an employee of the Shaoxing Tiancheng Silver Building, was recently sent to Shanghai by his employer to serve as the fully empowered representative of the silver building for marking gold purchases and sales. Recently, the gold market has soared, and Tiancheng has collected a large amount of cash and sent it to Shanghai, asking Fu to sell it. Unexpectedly, Fu colluded with Zhu Wenbo, the manager of the silver building, and after selling the cash, did not send all of the money to Tiancheng, embezzling as much as 150,000 taels. Recently, shareholder Li Yongquan discovered this and reported it to the Shaoxing Local Court. After investigation, the prosecutor found it to be true and filed a public prosecution, detaining Zhu Wenbo first. At the same time, Li Yongquan came to Shanghai to visit Fu. The day before yesterday, Li learned that Fu was hiding in Room 55, Baohe Hotel, Ziyoufang, Guangdong Road, and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station. Detective Chen Yonggui was ordered to arrest Fu. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. According to Ru Baozhi, the police lawyer, the plaintiff in this case has already filed a lawsuit with the official court, so Fu Boliang should be transferred to Shaoxing for trial. However, the Shaoxing Local Court did not send anyone to receive him today, so he requested a postponement of one week. Li Yongquan then complained about the situation. Fu Boliang also confessed to embezzling more than 100,000 yuan. Judge Zhou Hanting verified the confession and ordered that the case be rescheduled for one week for further verification.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Truth of Mercury in Noodles Case Still Unclear <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>No Sales Found in Nearby Drugstores</p>
<p>Wu Yantian Is Proceeding with Divorce</p>
<p>Wu Yantian, a coppersmith from Anhui residing at No. 316 Ruijin Road, reported that at noon on the 27th of last month, his wife, Bian, put mercury in noodles with the intention of poisoning him. Wu discovered this and reported it to the Harbin Police Station, which dispatched Peng Yushan to arrest Bian and escort her to the Special District Court for questioning. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over the investigation in the Third Criminal Court. According to Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, during the postponement, the police ordered detectives to investigate drugstores in the vicinity of the victim's residence to see if anyone had purchased mercury that morning. All said that they had not sold this kind of drug in several months. The defendant also firmly denied this in the police station. The doctor at the Public Works Bureau Hospital examined the bottom of the noodle bowl eaten by the victim and found mercury, which was taken out and placed in a small glass bottle, weighing five li. The bottle was presented for inspection. However, the nature of this material cannot be known in advance by non-experts. At the time, there were four bowls of noodles cooked, but only the victim's bowl had mercury at the bottom. Moreover, that morning, the victim intended to give his eleven-year-old daughter to another family as a child bride, but the defendant did not agree, leading to a dispute and the poisoning. Please investigate strictly. According to Wu Yantian, that morning, he was sleeping upstairs on the third floor and told Bian to bring the noodles upstairs for him to eat alone. Afterwards, he found this poisonous substance at the bottom of the bowl. He had never heard of Bian having any irregular behavior and hired a lawyer to defend him. In addition to punishing Bian, he also filed a divorce suit. When questioned, Wu Bian firmly denied it and also hired a lawyer to defend her. Judge Xiao ordered a date for sentencing. When she saw her eleven-year-old daughter standing next to her father wearing an old silk cheongsam, she demanded that the daughter go to prison with her, saying that the silk clothes worn by the daughter were not from her family, but had been sold by her father to others. She cried loudly. Afterwards, the court ordered police detectives to investigate. If the plaintiff had sold his daughter, he would be arrested immediately. Bian then stopped crying and returned to temporary detention.</p>

<p>Fan Guozhong Rescues Han Quanfa</p>
<p>Han Liansheng, a farmer from Hanjiazhai, Liuzao, Dazhangjing, Songjiang, has dozens of mu of thin land, which is enough for food and clothing. He has only one son, named Han Quanfa, who is ten years old and is very fond of him. In the middle of last month, a gang of bandits came to his house and kidnapped Quanfa. Han immediately reported it to the Land and Water Public Security Bureau for a thorough investigation. It has now been learned that the kidnapped victim and the kidnappers are hiding in a house at No. 1041 Yangshupu in Shanghai. The captain immediately led police detectives to Shanghai and, in cooperation with the detectives, secretly went to the house and rescued the kidnapped victim Han Quanfa. However, the kidnappers were well-informed and had already fled. It was found that the kidnapped victim had been hiding in the bandits' den for nearly a month and was mentally exhausted. Yesterday, Captain Fan took the kidnapped victim on the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train and returned to the Zhujing team headquarters for his family to pick him up. At the same time, he ordered detectives to track down the kidnappers and bring them to justice according to law.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Trial of a Large Group of Notorious Robbers <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Trial of Shen Shouying and Five Others Begins</p>
<p>Remaining Notorious Robbers to be Interrogated Later</p>
<p>Last month, the robber Ji Dahua gathered Yu Hengdao and Du Qizhi, armed them, and drove a stolen car to rob a certain family in the French Concession's Kangti Road, Quadali. They happened upon a special investigation unit of the French police, who were on patrol, so they did not dare proceed with the robbery. Yu and Du, carrying guns, fled back to the Huabin Hotel in Hongyunfang. Ji parked the car by the roadside and was discovered by investigators and arrested. Yu and Du were also apprehended, and individuals related to the case, including Hu Naiguang, Yu Bulou, and Qian Guangshu, were subsequently arrested. Suspicious individuals, including Shen Shouying, Chen Jinshan, Shan Yaonan, Zhang Fenglou, Dong Linshan, and Xu Lianyuan, a total of twelve people, were searched, yielding two handguns, bullet casings, and other items. It was also discovered that Ji, Yu, and Du had successively robbed the Yuchang shop at No. 38, Baoxingli, No. 33, and the Yunnan woman Chen Wangshi at No. 101 Sapo Race Road, taking their belongings. Qian Guangshu was linked to the case where Wu Tingfang, the bookkeeper of the Ruikang Paint Shop, jumped from a building and died. They were handed over to the Second Special Court's Criminal Division for interrogation. Due to the police investigation being incomplete, the interrogation was postponed. Yesterday, the due date arrived. At 2 PM, Judge Ge Zhitan took his seat in Criminal Court One for the continued interrogation. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated that, since the postponement, the police had discovered that Ji Wenhua, Du Qizhi, Yu Hengdao, Hu Naiguang, Yu Bulou, and Qian Guangshu were involved in the case and had conspired with the fugitive Mao Platoon Leader in a Nanjing hotel to plan three robberies. The police were prosecuting them for robbery. The remaining six defendants were not involved in the case, and the police requested instructions. Immediately thereafter, Shi Changfu, representing Wang Licai of No. 33 Baoxingli, Li Bingzhang, representing Liu Yangsan of the Yuchang shop at No. 38, and Chen Wangshi, the three victims, described the circumstances of the robberies. Chen Wangshi identified the defendant Yu Hengdao as having threatened her on the stairs with a gun at the time of the robbery. When Ji Wenhua was questioned, he confessed that the fugitive Mao Platoon Leader was the mastermind and that he, Yu Hengdao, Du Qizhi, and others had gone to commit robberies, but that he had not personally robbed anyone, only received money afterwards. He also stated that on the night of his arrest, they had planned to rob a "huahui" (flower club) telephone booth. Yu and Du confessed to having robbed the three victims. Hu Naiguang stated that the car used by Ji was initially purchased by a civilian for 300 yuan. However, because he could not obtain a license, he asked Ji to sell it for 400 yuan. He went to the Huabin Hotel to find Ji to collect the car price but did not see Yu and Du. They handed him a paper package, which he later realized contained a handgun, which he then discarded near the pit on the fourth floor of the hotel. He claimed no knowledge of the robbery. Yu Bulou stated that he had been to the Nanjing hotel but did not know of any discussions about robbery. Qian Guangshu confessed that on May 26th, Xue Xing invited him to No. 2, Sichengli, to discuss kidnapping and showed him a "ticket." He did not participate in the kidnapping, which was carried out by Xue and five other unknown individuals. On June 15th, the hostage jumped from a building and died. They were eating when the incident occurred and fled immediately. On September 14th, Yu Hengdao, Du Qizhi, and others discussed robbery in a Nanjing hotel. He provided the handgun, which he borrowed from Sister Zhu and returned to her after the robbery. He received eight yuan as his share afterwards. When questioned, Shen Shouying and the other six defendants all stated that they were completely unaware of the robbery and had been wrongly arrested, requesting investigation. Judge Ge, after reviewing the confessions, acquitted Shen Shouying, Chen Jinshan, Shan Yaonan, Zhang Fenglou, Dong Linshan, and Xu Lianyuan, and ordered their immediate release. The remaining six defendants were ordered to be detained in the detention center, and the continued interrogation was scheduled for November 14th, with assigned defense lawyers.</p>

<p>The Shandong Kui Sheng He sandboat, with Public Steersman Sheng on board, recently loaded more than 40,000 taels of salted hairtail and northern goods in Lushun and sailed to Shanghai to sell. On the 27th of last month, the boat was sailing in the northeastern waters of Tongshan when it suddenly encountered a hurricane. They steered toward the coast to seek shelter, but accidentally struck a reef and became stuck. The boat was immediately flooded. The boat owner, Jiang Yonghe, seeing the boat gradually sinking, instructed his crew to raise a distress flag and ring a gong for help. Unfortunately, the wind and waves were too strong, and no ships passed by to rescue them. The crew of thirty-three men were terrified. They lowered a sampan to escape, but the boat was too small for so many people. A sudden gust of wind capsized the sampan. The crew members on the boat saw the sampan capsize and the crew members floating in the sea. Unable to save them, they threw ropes into the sea, rescuing three people. Eleven crew members remained on the boat. The following morning, at dawn, some crew clung to the boat's planks and called for help as they drifted with the waves, but no ships came. Boat owner Jiang Yonghe and two crew members grabbed onto the top of the mast and waited for rescue. In the afternoon, the Jingyun steamship passed by and saw them. It dropped anchor, lowered a small boat, and rescued Jiang and the two crew members, providing them with clothes to change. The ship sailed past Haimen, dropped Jiang and the two off at the dock, and gave them two dollars each to take a boat to Shanghai. Jiang and the two crew members took the Jufeng Company's boat and arrived in Shanghai yesterday, reporting the incident to the sales agent and informing the Shandong company. It is reported that when the boat sank, eight crew members clung to the planks and drifted in the ocean, it is unknown whether they were rescued. Over twenty crew members on the poop deck perished, sinking into the sea before their eyes.</p>

<p>A Certain Gentleman's Message (Reporting a Large Shipment of Japanese Goods Entering Jiujiang)</p>
<p>The Jiujiang Anti-Japanese Association seized a large batch of Japanese textiles on the Taikoo Wharf yesterday. Upon discovery, the goods were immediately detained pending resolution. It was found that these Japanese goods were worth over 10,000 taels of silver and belonged to four well-known cloth stores in this city. The store owners or their managers are all prominent figures in the local business community. In the face of national crisis, every citizen should be motivated by conscience to sever economic ties with Japan and urge them to reflect. However, these gentlemen have dared to disregard the disapproval of the entire nation and have been blinded by profit, violating the patriotic movement and acting shamelessly and unconscionably. Furthermore, it is reported that this batch of Japanese goods used the trademarks of a certain British brand and changed the names one by one. At first glance, they appear to be Western goods, making it difficult for buyers to identify them. Their intentions can be described as cunning. Considering that the import and export of goods and the loading and unloading of ships cannot be done without the help of workers, such a large batch of enemy goods was imported into the interior, yet the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association was deceived and failed to discover it. If merchants everywhere imitate the above method of disguising and distributing goods, they will still flood the market. If so, the effectiveness of our boycott will only be equal to zero. I humbly submit what I have heard with a clear conscience. In addition to writing directly to the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association requesting that they strengthen their surveillance and prevent the source, I respectfully request that your newspaper publish this letter so that the anti-Japanese authorities in various places will pay attention to it. I am eagerly awaiting it.</p>

<p>Affix this stamp when communicating</p>
<p>Include stamps of appropriate value with the letter</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>Today, I saw a report stating that Jiading party members Lu Guanqün et al. sent a telegram regarding peace and unity. The last paragraph mentions "Lu Changlin and Sun Zongbing" and other party members from Songjiang County. The wording expresses dissatisfaction with Mr. Hu Hanmin's attitude. I had no prior knowledge of this telegram, and I am not acquainted with the lead signatory, Comrade Lu Guanqün. Most strangely, Songjiang County party member Sun Zongbing currently works at the Xiamen Radio Station, and his party membership has long been transferred. It is hateful that names are being borrowed to publish opinions. In addition to writing to Comrade Lu Guanqün, I am also writing to your newspaper requesting that this letter be published promptly in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the truth and stop the speculation. Your assistance will be greatly appreciated. Wishing you peace, Lu Changlin, Executive Committee Member of Songjiang County. November 4th.</p>

<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>"I am very happy. Several of your classmates in your grade have made very rapid progress in English. I know this is the result of your efforts. Therefore, there is really no need to worry about classmates whose English is not very good. You just need to work harder. There is absolutely nothing difficult in the world, and there is no effort that goes unrewarded." Mr. Wang, the English teacher, said happily, standing on the right side of the podium. He was very young, very handsome, and it was said that he had never been married. We admired him very much and respected him for his talent and appearance.</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, the classroom was particularly quiet. Everyone lowered their heads, looking at the books as if very attentively. Qi, who was sitting on my left, lowered her head even lower than the other students, and a faint blush appeared on her fair face. At that time, I knew that Qi was one of those the teacher was referring to when he said, "English is improving very quickly," because her progress was very rapid. Recently, she could almost be said to be the best in English in the whole grade.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Mr. Wang gave a topic in English composition class, saying, "Write a letter to your friend." After the teacher wrote the topic, he turned around and glanced at Qi with a happy smile, and then said, "Today's topic is very easy, right?" Many students happily answered, "It's easy. It's best to give more topics like this in the future, because the scope is large and we can easily develop our ideas." The teacher's smiling face seemed even happier at this time.</p>
<p>Two days later, the teacher had finished grading our papers and returned them to us. As usual, the students asked, "Whose English composition is the best?" They all hoped that their English composition would improve, so they always asked the best English composition students to take a look. The teacher's attitude did not seem as calm as usual, but after a while, he said very calmly, "That topic was easy, almost everyone did well. Now, I'll tell you, if you want to improve your English quickly, you should pay attention to the textbooks I teach, and you should also study the English books in the library more. Are there any of you who often go to the library? The books in the library are very good teachers for you and me. After class, you should go there."</p>
<p>After the English class, we didn't have any more classes, so a very loud voice said, "Who's going to the library? Those who are going, come with me quickly!" Many students also shouted back loudly, "Going, going!" and then hopped out of the classroom.</p>
<p>The teacher's words didn't seem to have any possible doubts, but the nervous me always felt that the teacher was a little different from usual, and Qi, who was sitting on my left, also made me feel that she was a little special.</p>
<p>Usually, when the teacher returned our English composition notebooks, Qi would always ask me, "What's your score?" and ask me to borrow my paper to take a look. But this time, when she got the paper, she opened it, glanced at it quickly, and then closed it, put it in the desk, and silently read the textbook.</p>
<p>Seeing her attitude, I suspected that she had either gotten a very good score or a very bad score. But after thinking for a while and observing her expression, I thought Qi would definitely not get a very bad score, because she had improved a lot this semester. Before she improved, her English composition was also within the top ten or so. So I thought she must have gotten a very good score... But after thinking about it, it didn't seem right. The time before last, before the teacher said that Qi was the best, she had happily put her paper in front of me and said with a smile, "Ninety-eight points, ninety-eight points!"</p>
<p>I spent the whole class in conjecture and curiosity. After the English class, the students of the grade all walked out of the classroom, except for me, Qi, and Wang and Zhang, who were writing love letters in the row farthest from me.</p>
<p>I noticed that Qi was a little special, so I gently asked her to see her English composition notebook. At the same time, I also gave her my English composition notebook.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>"Oh, it's nothing good, don't borrow it to take a look." Qi's expression seemed to be begging me, but when I saw the shallow smile on her face, her undisguised happy smile, I felt even more curious and even more inexplicable. So I continued, insisting on seeing her English composition notebook.</p>
<p>"Qi, to be honest with you, you are very different today than other days. If you have any secrets... any things that you don't want your classmates to know, you can tell me. I will definitely not tell anyone. Don't you believe that I am your best friend?" I said softly in her ear.</p>
<p>"There is nothing that I don't want my classmates to know about me. However, you know that the classmates' mouths are often idle, and they are usually good at exaggeration. If they know about me and Mr. Wang, wouldn't it be very inconvenient for Mr. Wang?" Qi said in a low voice with a blushing face, as she opened her English composition notebook for me to see.</p>
<p>"Oh, what a..." In Qi's English composition notebook, there was a letter written by Mr. Wang to Qi, with the opening salutation written as "My dear Qi." As soon as I saw it, I shouted out loudly unconsciously, but immediately stopped, when I realized that I was shouting loudly.</p>
<p>Wang and Zhang, who were writing love letters, turned around and glanced at us, asked "What's the matter?" and then continued to immerse themselves in writing love letters.</p>
<p>"Really, I feel really inexplicable. That day, the teacher gave the topic 'Write a letter to your friend,' and I vaguely wrote this love letter. That annoying Mr. Wang, I don't know why, even wrote me back a letter," Qi said as if calling out, as I looked at their love letter.</p>
<p>"No, I think Mr. Wang wrote it vaguely just like you. The deeper the love, the more vague the writing. So, in short, it is your love at work. Look, Wang and Zhang don't know what we are talking about, because they are vaguely intoxicated in their love," I said, pointing at Wang and Zhang. "You are terrible," Qi said with a smile as she hit me on my left shoulder.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Recent Irish Literary Scene <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Cong Ren</p>
<p>Mr. J.P. McGinley said at a meeting of the Irish Library Association, "If I had the power of a dictator, I would throw most of the books into the sea. Nine-tenths of the books selected for libraries represent the minds, interests, actions, and moral standards of the British. Sound films and radio are also opposed to our Irish education, because they come to our Irish ranks to spread their British and American ideas. These sound films and radio must be destroyed or monitored." From this, we can see how thorough the Irish people's spirit of nationalism is. In the field of literature and art, we can understand this situation even more clearly. Denis Johnstone's expressionist play "The Old Lady Says No" has made a comeback at the Gate Theatre, and his "Dublin Review" and the unstoppable, persevering Oliver St. John Gogarty's lyrics written on it were also performed in "Easter." When the two Russian films "Storm Over Asia" and "The End of St. Petersburg" were screened, more than six thousand people went to see them. Last autumn, the Peacock Theatre also screened an Irish "Amorous" film. Mr. Shaw's recent attempt to use new drama form, "Words Upon the Window Pane", was also performed at the Abbey Theatre. The Gate Theatre retaliated against the Abbey Theatre with the play "Back to Methuselah," calling the theatre full, and the Abbey Theatre retaliated against the Gate Theatre with Lennox Robinson's modernized translation of "The Critic." Robinson got the opportunity to ridicule Dublin's publishing, criticism, and intellectual circles for "The Critic." Mr. Sam Beekett, who is currently a French lecturer at Trinity College, has also written a study of Proust. A very modern bookstore has recently opened on Tavern Street.</p>
<p>The Publication Examination Bureau is also very diligent in promoting the moral well-being of Irish readers. "New Leader" was recently banned from publication for publishing an advertisement for birth control. Novels by Aldous Huxley, Somsrest Maugham, Liam O'Flaherty, and Lewis Sinclair have also been banned, because "their overall trend is obscene. But elsewhere, books on birth control must be freely advertised under the fierce light of inspection. Marie Stopes, Margaret Sanger, and even Russell are regarded as damaging to public morals. Only Eliner Glyn, Ethel M. Dnll, and Margaret Reterson are left to do this good work.</p>
<p>Also, Peader O'Donnell recently changed the name of his "The Knife" to "There Will Be Fighting" and published it in the United States. O'Donnell can be regarded as the greatest Irish writer of the last decade, but he is still relatively unknown among the intellectual circles in Dublin. This is mostly because he does not show his personality in "First Nights" and "The Sunday Evening Post." They really only read his books in "The Sunday Observer", which other people consider to be a good British review. But those who only knew about Joyce ten years after the world discovered Joyce are not expected to know about O'Donnell now. O'Donnell has published four novels, which describe the lives of farmers and their various aspects of national struggle. "Storm" was probably published ten years ago and is now out of print. This novel showed his hopes for success. The first few chapters of the book describe the storm along the coast of Donegal, which is beautifully written, but other than that, there is nothing remarkable about it. In 1925, he gave the manuscript of another novel to O'Flaherty. O'Flaherty read it once, sealed it in an envelope, and sent it to his own publisher, Johnathan Capo. Soon, "Islander" was published in England, and critics said that it was a masterpiece describing peasant life. Later, the book was renamed "The Way it Was with Them" and appeared in the United States. In 1927, while he was writing, he suddenly received the news that the Sullivan family of Adrigoolc had starved to death. As a result, he wrote his third novel, "Adrigoolc," in anger and pity. This book is still considered his most perfect work. His fourth novel, "The Knife," shows great progress in technique. However, O'Donnell's best works have not yet come. He is only thirty-five years old now. Although many years of fierce struggle, forty-one days of hunger strike, and constant revolutionary activities have left their marks on his body, he is still surprisingly lively. His upcoming novel is the last volume of a set that combines with the previous four books. After this book is written, he will start his new work from a larger perspective... a "History of Ireland after 1830" similar to Krupotkin's "History of the French Revolution".</p>
<p>Now O'Donnell is very free. What I mean is that he has not been arrested by the police in the past year, and no one knows that he is currently living in a beautiful residential area outside Dublin... Yes, it is hard to believe that a revolutionary party member would actually live in a red house outside Dublin.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Four Hundredth Anniversary of the German Painter Burgkmair <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Deming</p>
<p>In 1928, the people of Nuremberg, Germany, celebrated the four hundredth anniversary of the birth of their most famous historical figure - the great painter Durer. Three years later (this year), the people of Augsburg celebrated the four hundredth anniversary of the birth of "Augsburg's Durer" -</p>
<p>Hans Burgkmair - The most important of the celebrations was the exhibition of Burgkmair's works.</p>
<p>The small house where Burgkmair lived when he was born still exists. It is located in the most secluded corner of the city. He spent almost all his life there, except for visiting the woodcut master Schongauer in Alsace when he was eighteen and going to Italy several times. Although his trips to Italy were very short, they were extremely important to the progress of his art. Originally, Italy was the center of art at that time. When Mr. Burgkmair was in Italy, he lingered in art galleries every day, looked at famous masterpieces, and gained a lot.</p>
<p>He was the brother-in-law of the portrait painter Holbein the Elder (Holbein father and son were both famous painters, the father was called Holbein the Elder to distinguish him from his son). Durer was his friend and also the person who had the greatest influence on his art.</p>
<p>Burgkmair's works are divided into two categories: (1) Woodcuts - he produced no less than seven hundred woodcuts, all of which are rich in the spirit of freedom. These woodcuts are mostly serial works (Service). The most famous is "The Triumph of Emperor Maximilian I," which consists of one hundred and thirty-five large works, using chiaroscuro to achieve the ultimate in art. (2) Paintings - Paintings are divided into two categories: (1) Portrait paintings and (2) Landscape paintings. In the eyes of many critics, his paintings are his most mature works. His paintings had a great influence on many painters of his time. Originally, he was the first person to introduce the spirit of the Renaissance into German painting. His contribution to German painting is equal to the contribution of Riermenschneider to German sculpture, and his influence is more lasting than Riermenschneider.</p>
